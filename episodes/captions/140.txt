00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000 This is Jockel podcast number 140.
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000 Without controls and me, Jockel Willick.
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000 Good evening, I go. Good evening.
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000 If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000 if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too.
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000 If you can wait and not be tired by waiting or being lied about, don't deal in lies or being hated,
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000 don't give way to hating and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise.
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:55.000 If you can dream and not make dreams your master, if you can think and not make thoughts your aim.
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000 If you can meet triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same.
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:15.000 If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken, twisted by naves to make a trap for fools or watch the things you gave your life to broken.
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000 And stoop and build them up with worn out tools.
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:39.000 If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss and lose and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss.
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000 If you can force your heart and nerve and sin you to serve your turn long after they are gone.
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:58.000 And so hold on when there is nothing in you, accept the will which says to them, hold on.
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:06.000 If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue or walk with kings nor lose the common touch,
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000 if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you but none too much.
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:27.000 If you can fill the unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run, yours is the earth and everything that's in it.
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.000 And which is more, you'll be a man, my son.
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:48.000 And that of course is the classic poem which is called if and it's by read your kippling.
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:58.000 And of course we have covered some of his less, I guess famous has less famous poems on this podcast.
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000 We covered infantry columns, which a lot of people don't know the name infantry columns.
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000 But that's the poem that talks about boots, boots, boots.
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000 Moving up and down.
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000 Yeah that one.
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000 We read the young British soldier, which is about Afghanistan.
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000 We read a bit of Tommy.
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000 And of course kippling was an incredible writer.
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:39.000 And he talked a lot about war, talked a lot about being a man and his own son, his one son John was killed in World War I.
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000 Not the battle of Lose and these are great poems.
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.000 And I recently read a poem called the mental cases by Wilford Owen and when we got done with that podcast,
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000 I actually said I should have read it again.
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000 And I did and I said I go back to the beginning and listen to it again.
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000 But I should have actually picked it apart a little bit.
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000 Because it's kind of like what I said about Shakespeare when we did Henry the fifth.
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000 And I said, you can't get frustrated with Shakespeare.
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000 You can't think that you're just going to read Shakespeare and just get it.
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000 It doesn't work that way.
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000 There's more to it than that.
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000 There's more depth there.
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000 There's words you might not know.
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000 There's references that might not be obvious.
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000 There's and it's the same thing when you look at poems like this.
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000 There's more to them than you can get with just like reading it.
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000 Right?
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000 There's layers.
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000 There's what we're talking about.
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000 So the poem that I just read if is like I said it's a classic.
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000 It's read often.
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000 It should be read.
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000 But there's and that's part of the reason why I didn't cover it for a long time.
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000 Because I kind of thought everyone just knew it.
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000 But everyone knows that.
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000 Everyone knows that.
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000 Everyone knows that.
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000 Everyone's read that poem.
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000 It's actually not true.
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000 Talk to a lot of people.
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000 And I say, oh yeah, it's like, if.
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000 And they say, what's that?
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000 So in order to sort of solve that problem,
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000 we cover on the podcast.
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000 Now people will hear this poem and learn from it.
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000 And I want to spend a little bit of time breaking it down.
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000 Because there's all kinds of important lessons in it.
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000 Really solid, really solid guidance.
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000 And then when we understand it, then I'll go back and read it again.
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000 The way it's supposed to hit you when you know what's going on.
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000 So breaking it down a little bit.
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000 There's and there's themes in this that we've heard.
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000 I've talked about.
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000 And they're just consistent through time.
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000 So here it starts off.
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000 If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blame.
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000 Get on you.
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000 This someone's pretty self explanatory.
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000 Keep your head.
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000 Don't lose your temper.
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000 Stifle your emotions as I want to sound as podcast.
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000 And it's saying, especially when everyone else around you is not only losing their temper,
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000 but on top of that, they're blaming you.
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000 This is a little bit of ownership.
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000 This is a little bit of extreme ownership.
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000 And I've talked about that. When someone blames you for something,
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000 you know what you do? You say, yeah, you're right. It is my fault.
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000 This is what I'm going to do to fix it.
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000 You pathetic. You don't say that part.
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000 You keep that to yourself.
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000 When there's a problem and people have blamed you on you own it.
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000 Own it.
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000 And don't lose your temper.
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000 Stifle your emotions.
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000 Next line.
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000 If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000 but make allowance for their doubting too.
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000 There's a little dichotomy here, right?
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000 So you got to be confident. Of course.
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000 Trust yourself. That's what it means.
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000 Believe in yourself.
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000 Even when other people are doubting you.
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000 You've got to trust that you're doing the right thing.
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000 You've got to trust that you're capable.
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000 You've got to trust that you can make this happen.
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000 That's what it means to trust yourself when all men doubt you.
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000 But there's a dichotomy here.
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000 And this is so important because that, because what that means,
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000 what that one line alone could lead to is,
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000 hey, I'm just going to be overconfident.
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000 Hey, I'm right. Everyone else is wrong. You don't get it.
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000 That's not what's being said here because there's a butt.
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000 That's the dichotomy part.
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000 The butt is the dichotomy part.
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000 Because while you got to believe in yourself, yes.
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000 And at the same time, you also have to make allowance for their doubts.
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000 That means you have to understand that you might have some issues.
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000 You might not be perfect. You might be wrong.
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000 You might not be as smart or as talented or as square to away.
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000 As you think you are and your idea that you came up with might not be the best one.
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000 So yes, you got to have confidence even when people are down in you,
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000 but you got to remember that they could be down in you for a good reason.
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000 You could be wrong.
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000 You should always have that in the back of your head.
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000 That's the dichotomy.
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000 Humble.
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000 Confident. But humble.
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000 That's what we're talking about.
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000 Next line.
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000 If you can wait and not be tired by waiting.
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000 Patience.
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000 That's about patience.
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000 I think I've told this.
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000 If I told this story about being on a ship and waiting for a child.
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000 Not that I can remember.
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000 Okay, so.
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000 Because on my first deployment as a seal on a ship in the Navy,
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000 we're overseas, we're spending a lot of time at sea.
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000 And to eat food, which was I'm not going to say it with scarce.
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000 But they feed you three times a day and on the type of ship I was on,
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000 and they'll be a ship.
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000 There's several hundred Marines on board.
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000 Obviously there's the sailors that run the ship.
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000 There's seals. We're, you know, an 18 man seal putt in on there.
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000 But everyone's got to be fed.
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000 What is child time?
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000 And so everyone will go to line up for child.
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000 You get in line. And the line would be long.
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000 And depending on the hungry yard, maybe you want to get up there a little early.
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000 Anyways, to make a long story short.
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000 So we get in line and whatever reason.
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000 They got this rule that you're not allowed to lean on the bulkhead.
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000 You know the bulkhead is in a plane I do.
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000 You know, playing what is it?
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000 That front part.
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000 Yeah, that's a front part.
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000 You know, it's a wall.
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000 Yeah.
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000 Basically on a ship or an aircraft, it's a wall.
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000 It's a bulkhead.
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000 So for whatever reason in the Navy,
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000 you're standing in the child line.
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000 You're not supposed to lean on the bulkhead.
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000 So imagine this.
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000 You're going to be standing there for your standing three inches from a wall,
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000 but you're not supposed to lean on it.
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:39.000 Yeah.
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000 Now, this isn't a three minute stand.
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000 This is half an hour.
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000 This is 40 minutes waiting for the child to open up and then serve everybody.
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000 Right.
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000 And I remember I learned something about patience.
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000 Mm-hmm.
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000 Because then you get these guys that,
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000 you know, the people that they have a little bit of authority,
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000 and they're going to use it.
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000 Sure.
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000 And if given the opportunity, they will abuse it.
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000 They're going to take it to the next level.
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000 So there'd be some guys, not all of them.
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000 I was always my goal to make friends with anybody.
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000 I had anything to do with feeding on a ship.
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000 I wanted to be there, bro.
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000 Because then you get a couple extra chicken nuggets.
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000 You know, maybe you get an extra scoop full of ravioli,
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000 which is, which is important.
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000 It's important.
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000 Yeah.
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000 Big time.
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000 Especially when you're trying to pack on the mask.
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000 Right.
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000 So I try to be friends with all those people, but some of those guys,
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000 they didn't care about friends, right?
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000 They had that authority.
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000 Mm-hmm.
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000 And one of this one guy, I remember he had the authority.
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000 It was he was in charge of making sure that line was, you know,
00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000 maintained discipline.
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000 And the line that was his deal.
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000 And he had a badge of some kind.
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000 I want to say he was a master gums, which is a job in the Navy.
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000 I think he, this guy was actually a master gums.
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000 So we had some kind of badge.
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000 Right?
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000 So that takes that authority out of two.
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000 One, maybe two notches.
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000 Yeah.
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000 He's coming at you.
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000 Yeah.
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000 So I'm standing in line one day.
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000 And I'm leaning on the bulkhead.
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000 Am I being a little bit lazy?
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000 Sure.
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000 I'm telling you, it's a long deployment, right?
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000 I'm leaning on the bulkhead.
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000 He comes over.
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000 Hey, no leaning on the bulkhead.
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000 You know what I did?
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000 What? Got off the bulkhead.
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000 I just stood up straight.
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000 Didn't get mad.
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000 Didn't get angry.
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000 He's doing his job.
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000 Not supposed to leave on the bulkhead.
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000 Just normal face.
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000 Yep.
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000 Okay.
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000 Was I a broken man?
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000 Was I a broken man?
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000 Did my, did my will break?
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000 I don't think so.
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000 What I did was I accepted.
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000 I was able to wait.
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000 And end not be tired by waiting.
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000 So be patient.
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000 This, this, the moral of that line.
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000 We'll technically, you weren't able to wait without getting tired because you leaned on the bulkhead.
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000 Right? You got corrected.
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000 I got corrected.
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000 And then I got untired.
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000 Gosh.
00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000 Yeah.
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000 Yeah.
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000 All right.
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000 Next line.
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000 Or being lied about don't deal in lies.
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000 Mm-hmm.
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000 People are going to lie about you.
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000 Tell the truth.
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000 Tell the truth about what's going on.
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000 Getting caught in the web of lies.
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000 Not fun.
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000 No.
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000 You see it happen with people.
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000 I'm trying to think, remember when you're a little kid and you think you'd get away with some little web of lies.
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000 Oh, yeah.
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000 Like, yeah.
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000 Or you see your kids do it.
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000 Yeah.
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000 They, they tell a little lie about something and the web just encapsulates them.
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000 But adults do that too.
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000 You see that happen.
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000 You see that happen with, in politics.
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000 Yeah.
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000 You know, I never did this.
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000 You know what I mean?
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000 And then they have video.
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000 They have audio.
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000 And it's just, if that person would have said, hey, this is what I did.
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000 This is what I did.
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000 I'm sorry.
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000 I'm not a bad mistake.
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000 I throw myself to the judgment of the people, right?
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000 Okay, fair enough.
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000 But instead they make up some lie about, I'm not a lie.
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000 I'm never seen that woman before in my life.
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000 Yeah.
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000 Oh, really?
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000 We have a video of you.
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000 Yeah.
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000 Apparently quite acquainted with this woman.
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000 Or whatever.
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000 So yeah, don't get in the web of lies.
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000 It's not going to help you.
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000 Next line.
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000 Or being hated.
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000 Don't give way to hating.
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000 Now what's interesting about this is we actually have a name for these people now.
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000 Right?
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000 Haters.
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000 Haters.
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000 Right?
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000 That's a new word.
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000 I don't think there was such a thing as haters.
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000 When I was a kid, there was no such thing as haters.
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000 Yeah.
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000 There was someone that didn't like you.
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000 You wouldn't say that's a person's a hater.
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000 Yeah.
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000 No, it wasn't a thing.
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000 Well, there's an added like sprinkled in element.
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000 When you say hater, haters typically is like,
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000 some of the hates everybody.
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000 No, someone who hates everything.
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000 No, it's one there's an element of jealousy in there.
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000 That's what they hate.
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000 Okay.
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000 So I actually nailed this then.
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000 Actually, so as I was thinking about this, that's kind of what I thought.
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000 Some people aren't going to like you.
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000 For whatever reason, but oftentimes the reason isn't you.
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000 It's actually them.
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000 Yeah.
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000 That's it.
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000 It's them.
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000 It's their, they hate your success.
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000 They hate your happiness.
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000 They hate their, they hate the fact that you got whatever it is.
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000 Whatever it is that they want, right?
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000 That's jealousy.
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000 So yeah, some people are going to get, you know, they're going to be haters.
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000 Yeah.
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000 And so the recommendation here is, no, don't, don't give it back to them.
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000 Yeah.
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000 Yeah.
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000 There's a, you ever heard that the opposite of love isn't hate.
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000 The opposite of love is a difference.
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000 Yeah.
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000 So the opposite of hate is in difference, too.
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000 Right?
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000 Yeah.
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000 Right.
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000 That's sort of my recommended, recommended course of action.
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000 Someone that hates the fact that you're winning.
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000 I kind of feel sorry for him, right?
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000 But yeah, you've got to pass that, I guess.
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000 Yeah.
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.000 If you get by the emotional part when someone's hating on you.
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000 Yeah.
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000 You do kind of, I mean, you can depends on who you are, I guess.
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000 But you can kind of feel sorry for him because it's like it's kind of
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000 a lonely, like actually I think when I say, I feel sorry for him.
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000 I think that's almost like a little bit of a, that's a little bit of ego of mine, too.
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000 Like a little dig like, like I feel sorry for that.
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000 Right.
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000 It's a defense mechanism of my own.
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000 I think, you know what I mean?
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000 Yeah.
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000 It's kind of a back, it's a backhanded insult.
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000 Right.
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000 You know, oh, you know, Ecos said this about you.
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000 You know, I actually feel sorry for him.
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000 Yeah.
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000 It's almost like that guy's so low.
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000 So yes, I think there's a little bit of ego there from my point when I say something like that.
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000 Yeah.
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000 So that's why I think the differences might maybe be the better step.
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000 Like, hey, whatever, man.
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000 Yeah.
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000 Hey, some people are going to like me.
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000 Some people, that's I'm going to get with it.
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000 Yeah.
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000 And there's a culture of embracing that to, you know, how people will be like,
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000 Hey, if you don't have haters, you're doing something wrong or something like that.
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000 Like, they'll say that kind of stuff.
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000 Ah.
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000 To me, you know how you talk about how someone says, hey, that's just the way I am.
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000 That's my personality.
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000 Yeah.
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000 To me, that is brushing up against it, right?
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000 Yeah.
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000 Good, yeah.
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000 You know, if some people go, some people can hate me.
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000 That's the way it is.
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000 It's like, no, actually, yeah.
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000 Well, let's think about at least let's account for a little bit.
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000 Let's figure out, you know, maybe why.
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000 Yeah.
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000 Yeah.
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000 Actually, something, I mean, this is kind of a smaller deal than even more.
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000 Me talking about it, but something tells me you're going to do it anyway.
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000 I mean, I mean, in the spirit of trying to understand the nature of haters and
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000 people who are actually talking on a podcast right now about the nature of haters.
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000 Well, someone say, hey, if you don't have haters, you're doing something wrong.
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000 Meaning you're not doing something big enough for the jealous people in the world to be jealous of.
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000 This is sort of that.
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000 This is like a whole, this is a whole area that we just don't want to do.
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000 Right?
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000 I mean, seriously, right?
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000 This is like, it's stupid.
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000 This is like the area that we're just not.
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000 Yeah.
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000 That's why I think that's what's good.
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000 What the statement here.
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000 Don't being hated.
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000 Don't get way to hating.
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000 Yeah.
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000 In different move on.
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000 Let's not worry about it.
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000 Yeah.
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000 And next line.
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000 I'm going to capitalize it.
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000 Yeah.
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000 All right.
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000 Next.
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000 And yet, don't look too good nor talk too wise.
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000 Don't look too good nor talk too wise.
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000 So this is, this is important because this is a little bit of dichotomy too of, hey,
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000 don't get way to hating.
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000 Don't deal in lies, but at the same time saying, don't look too good or talk.
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000 Too wise.
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000 So you gotta keep it real, basically.
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000 And you don't want to be a noodle.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000 You don't want to talk down to people.
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000 You don't want to be the person that comes across like, oh, I would, I'm virtuous.
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000 I'm more virtuous than you.
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000 That's what that line is, right?
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000 Don't try and look too good.
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000 Like you'd never do anything wrong.
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000 It's like, oh, that guy got in trouble.
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000 That guy got caught in a web of lies.
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000 Instead of, you know, jump.
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000 It's like, hey, you know what?
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000 He made a mistake.
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000 I hope he could luck to him.
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000 I hope he can figure it out.
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000 When we find the right path out of his situation,
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.000 instead of talking like, oh, I'm, I, that would never happen to me because I'm virtuous.
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000 Yeah.
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000 Or talk too wise, which is, you know, I know everything, right?
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000 Yeah.
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000 I think that's, yeah.
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000 People that are trying to come across, you know,
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000 remember when we were on with Captain Charlie Plum and Jim Kunkle.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000 And they were trying to drag me into being like them.
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000 They're, you know, like, I, you know, what were your,
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000 warriors like you, Jocco and I was like, no, guys.
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000 No, yeah.
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000 They're guys.
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000 Our totally, like, not just, not just like more heroic than me,
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000 but on top of that better people.
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000 Like, I'm like a rat running around,
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000 compared to those guys.
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000 And so, yeah.
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000 I'm not ever trying to be, you know, a guy that's saying, oh, yeah.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000 Well, I'm, I'm, I'm virtuous and you're not, no.
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000 Hey, man, we're all struggling.
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000 Yeah.
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000 Could this mean to, you know, it's as, don't look too good in order to,
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000 like, you know, okay, this is the concept where, you know,
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000 when people make speeches or they'll, they'll have some sales pitch or something,
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000 and they'll want every word to be perfect.
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000 But then when a, when a sales pitch is like super perfect,
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000 it doesn't connect as well as if it's just a person talking normal.
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000 To you, you know, it's a, you know, it's a, you know, it's a, you know,
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000 it's a, you know, it's just that idea, you know, like, so if someone's focusing so hard
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000 and being like perfect in every way and like knowing every single possible thing
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000 and just not showing any flaws, like focusing on it,
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000 maybe that's a mistake because they kind of created this connect.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000 I actually, I don't think that's what this is talking about,
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000 but I think it is correct.
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000 So I don't give you the example from my perspective,
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000 one of the reasons that podcasts right now do really well is because they're normal people
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000 talking like normal people.
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000 And I think that if, if, if, and there are podcasts out there that are way polished and everything,
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000 and I don't like to listen to those podcasts that are all polished, right?
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000 I don't run, there's very few, actually, I can't think of any,
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000 any of the podcasts that I actually like are polished to that end degree, right?
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:26.000 Because that's when you're talking about, you know, a highly produced with the background music and all that stuff,
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000 like those podcasts, I don't, I don't like those as much.
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000 I don't like those, but even when you talk about the produced part, like hardcore history,
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000 he's still talking, he's, he's still talking, I mean, obviously,
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000 Joe Rogan, obviously Tim Ferris, even Margar made, right?
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000 Margar made, he's, he's talking, right?
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000 He's not just making things happen.
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000 So I think there's something to that.
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000 There's something to the fact that we're not talking about doing everything perfect.
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000 For sure, for sure.
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000 Yeah, agree.
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000 I think if, if this podcast, what would this podcast would be sound like?
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000 Maybe like, welcome to, welcome to the Jocco podcast.
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000 This is episode 140.
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000 We're here to talk to you today about a red good kippling.
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000 He was born in, a papai.
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000 And just one of those who want to listen to that.
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, if it sounds like, well, because I think anyway,
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000 and it has a lot to do with what you're used to, you know, where, like,
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000 if you're used to like a polished presentation and then all of a sudden,
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000 it's not polished, it's like, oh, he kind of fumbled through that.
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000 Well, there's a difference between not polished and I have also heard podcasts
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000 that are not prepared or not professional, right?
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000 Yeah, that's another, the other aspect from, and you can, there's a dichotomy.
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000 Yeah, because you can go too far. Sometimes I think people just, they think, well,
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000 Joe Rogan, he just presses record and talks.
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000 Yeah, they think that that's just what that is.
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000 I'll just press record and I'll talk with this other guy.
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000 And then you, then you listen to them and you think,
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000 there's a reason why Joe Rogan is so popular.
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000 Yes, yes.
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000 The reason is Joe Rogan so popular is because even when he's just conversing,
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000 he's got a skill set that he was probably born with, and then he
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000 honed it as a comedian and then he honed it as an actor, then he honed it as a, as a,
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000 an announcer for the UFC, and then he started this podcast, as we were already
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000 good at it, and then he's done 1500 podcasts that are two, three and four hours
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000 long. So guess what? You get good at figuring out, you listen to yourself,
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000 oh, that didn't sound good. And so, so there's a big difference.
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000 Yes, there's podcasts that people just think they're going to hit record and just
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000 talk and that's going to be super cool.
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000 Dicotomy, not cool.
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000 Hard to listen to.
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000 Some of those are hard to listen to.
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000 Got a gut through them.
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000 So check.
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000 All right, next line.
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000 If you can dream and not make dreams, you're master.
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000 That ones pretty, that's a pretty awesome line.
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000 That's a pretty awesome line.
00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000 And there's, it's a dichotomy, yes, dream, but don't make them your master.
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000 Don't make dreams, you're living reality, right?
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000 Yeah, okay, okay.
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000 Living reality, not in the world of dreams.
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000 If your dreams are your master, what are you actually doing?
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000 Dade dream, you know, I'll take a day dreaming all day.
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000 You gotta make something happen.
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000 That's what's gotta go down.
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000 Next, very similar, if you can think and not make thoughts your aim.
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:28.000 So, yes, of course, think, but don't make your goal to sit around and think.
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000 In my mind, when I hear this, maybe I'm my own personal biases coming into it,
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.000 this seems like a little shot at philosophers and academics, right?
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000 That sit around all day and what they're doing is they're thinking that's what they do.
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000 Little shot at those guys because don't make thoughts your aim.
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000 You want to actually go and do things, you want to make things happen, you want to live.
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000 There's a difference there.
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000 Yeah.
00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:03.000 And that's actually that's like a, because, you know how, like, I feel like you're kind of the example of that.
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000 Like when I start saying, even whether it be on this thing or even in real life,
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000 we're, I'll start explaining something because I'll be super interested in like how this thing works.
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000 And hey, did you see what happened there?
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000 Explain then, you're attitude has always been like, yeah, okay, like, okay.
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000 Give me an example.
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000 What do you mean by real life?
00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000 Outside of recording.
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000 So, like, analyze like if someone's like, if I were to talk about haters, like, I could analyze that.
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000 Oh, you're a good deal.
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000 You know, it's a separate podcast.
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:31.000 Yeah.
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:31.000 Yeah.
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000 That's what I was podcasting.
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000 The dynamic, the dynamic of like, you know what people, how dynamics of haters.
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000 That episode, what?
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000 How people, I feel like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000 But you'll be like, all right, you know, okay, we understand is you,
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000 you do it for more like, hey, we're going to understand so we can take action or, you know, whatever.
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000 All, all just explain the understanding because it's fun to explain the understanding.
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000 I'm looking for application of that knowledge to usually leadership situations.
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000 Yes.
00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.000 Yes.
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000 Exactly.
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000 And then you'll, it seems like you'll dig into like understanding it.
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000 Like, as deep as you have to, to take action and that's it.
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000 No deeper.
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000 You know, I'm not going to sit around and meditate on it.
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000 That's what it seems like your channel fully did.
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.000 Yeah.
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000 And also, I think that the understanding of the broad concept is more important than the,
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000 then the minutia.
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000 Yeah.
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000 You got to understand the details, yes, but when I understand the broad concept,
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000 and then you can move forward and you know what you're dealing with.
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000 Yeah.
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.000 And then in academic type as we, as the example, as your example kind of talks about,
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000 like, they'll, they're kind of goal is the, is the thought is the analyzing.
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000 Oh, see how this works.
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000 And that's the whole goal.
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000 Their goal is never really to take action.
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000 Someone's going to take action.
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000 But their goal is the thought of it.
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000 That's what it seems.
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000 I think that's one thing that Dan Carlin from Hardcore History does is he.
00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:01.000 So he, like, a lot of times, I'm comparing what I'm reading about in historical situations to what I've either been through myself,
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:08.000 or, or other books that I've read, other situations I know about.
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000 Dan Carlin does one book to another book or one time to another book time.
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:22.000 And the other thing that he does is he takes it to us, like he'll say, imagine if you were imagine if America right now elected a person like he,
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000 so he brings it into like real time.
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.000 Yeah.
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000 That's his, that's his, to me, that's what makes, that's part of what makes his long things that make his podcast excellent.
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:37.000 But that's one of the things that makes it very engaging is he brings it to imagine if this happened today.
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000 Yeah.
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000 Imagine if the Germans attack, you know, he just brings it to today.
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000 So it makes you think about it.
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000 Yeah.
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000 Andy compares it to other time periods.
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000 So there's some similarities there.
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000 But his thoughts aren't his aims.
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000 Yeah.
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000 I don't think.
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000 Yeah.
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000 And I wouldn't even say, well, I think when I just said that, I think he takes the thoughts and applies him to current times.
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000 Right.
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000 That's what makes it interesting.
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000 Yeah.
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000 Or want to, again, one of the things that makes it interesting.
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000 Yeah.
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000 And I wouldn't even say being the thoughts being your aims is necessarily a bad thing across the board.
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000 I think, you know, obviously his approach it is.
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:21.000 But, you know, the person who just kind of gets a huge payoff in figuring out how things work and that's sort of it, you know, like in there.
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.000 And it's kind of like, hey, if I'm a, you know, I want to figure out how this, I don't know, this engine motor works.
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000 It's up to the engine builder to build more engines or build the better engine.
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000 Yeah.
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000 Yeah.
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000 They're just really interested in how things work.
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000 Yeah.
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:42.000 Is it possible to be super, you know, like people that want to understand you, too, but they don't want to do it.
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000 They're on moves, but they don't want to roam.
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000 Well, there is that for sure.
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000 Oh, yeah.
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000 There is that.
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000 And I mean, depending on who you're, obviously that philosophy won't kind of drive with your whole thing.
00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:04.000 But, yeah, I could see how that could be if someone's like, yeah, like, I don't know, someone who's not into necessarily the physical part of it as much as the mental part and maybe like the watch it.
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000 Yeah.
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.000 And I suppose some guys that can't train hard anymore because whatever they got injured or whatever and they still are into it.
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000 Oh, yeah.
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000 Or these coaches that like maybe were going to something, but they, like, they know.
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000 And they're like the best coaches, you know, that kind of person.
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000 Yeah.
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000 John Donahar, he doesn't have any world championships under his belt.
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000 I don't think.
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000 Yeah.
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000 I don't know.
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000 But maybe we'd grab Jackson.
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000 I don't think Greg Jackson would get Greg Jackson's even fought in the man don't think.
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000 Not one time.
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000 Yeah.
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000 One of the best coaches that I know.
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000 Which is ever so yeah, so you get that kind of person.
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000 But would it be saying that he made his thoughts his aim?
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000 No, because he put those, he applied them.
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000 Yeah.
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000 So well then again, swing and a mess.
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000 But in those academics though, seem same.
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000 Like the in academic type person, maybe they're a professor or something.
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000 They teach about business or sales.
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000 They don't own a business.
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000 They're a professor.
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000 But they teach about business all this up.
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000 So that's kind of, it's kind of their, their thoughts are their aims is kind of like that's their action.
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000 That's that's their putting their thoughts into action.
00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000 So I guess less of a shot than maybe I read it as originally.
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000 It's a lost person.
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000 Yeah.
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000 It is.
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000 All right.
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.000 Well, I think you're right.
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.000 I think you're right.
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000 All right.
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000 Next, if you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposter's just the same,
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000 what align that is.
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000 Triumph and disasters and he calls them both imposter's.
00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000 He calls both triumph and disaster calls them both imposter's.
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000 Why is that because they are?
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.000 Because they are because neither triumph or disaster is an end all or be all.
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000 Neither of them.
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000 They feel like it at the time when you raise your hands and you get the victory.
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000 Mm-hmm.
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000 You feel like that is a be all end all but as Pat and said.
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000 All glorious fleeting.
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000 Right.
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000 That triumph is going to fade.
00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000 Triumph is an in-eternal victory.
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000 It's an imposter of one and this is what's important.
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000 And this is the one that's harder for people to overcome.
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000 Is that disasters the same way?
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000 Something's happened to us and it seems like it's the end of the world.
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000 Mm-hmm.
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000 But it's not.
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000 Disaster is also an imposter.
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:23.000 This happens to, this happens to teenage kids in their little relationships.
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000 Right.
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000 Right?
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000 Teenage kids and their relationships.
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000 They break up and they think it's the end of the world.
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.000 And if they only knew that in three years they wouldn't even remember that person's name.
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000 Yeah.
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000 They wouldn't even remember that person's name.
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000 If you could never tell him that.
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.000 No.
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000 You can't ever, you could never like that.
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000 You couldn't convince them in a million years.
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000 No.
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000 That in three years they will not remember that person's name.
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000 Not even close.
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000 Not even close.
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000 You can't knock.
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000 This is the mind of crazy thing.
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000 And if you don't both know this factually.
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000 Yeah.
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000 The girlfriend that you had when you were 14 years old at that time.
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000 There was no way that you were ever going to think about another girl.
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000 That was the one.
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000 Right now you don't know what her name was.
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000 You better leave remember what she looks like.
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000 Come on.
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000 Mm-hmm.
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000 But that's what he's saying.
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000 Mm-hmm.
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000 That when that girl breaks up with you or guy, if you're, if you're a girl,
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000 the guy that broke your heart, you're not even a member of his name.
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000 And you know what he's doing now?
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000 Not much.
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000 Mm-hmm.
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000 Not much.
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000 Don't worry about that dude.
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000 I don't know.
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000 Maybe.
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000 Yeah.
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000 I guess that's a good point.
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000 Maybe.
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000 Maybe you've done good.
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000 Mm-hmm.
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000 Well, it's the mind of the most likely.
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000 Yeah.
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000 These disasters that you have.
00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000 And then you know, you're teasing it.
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000 That's an easy one.
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000 But you know, your business has a big issue.
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000 Mm-hmm.
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000 So man, this within six months of opening victory MMA, the roof collapsed.
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000 Do you remember that?
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000 Mm-hmm.
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000 The drunk driver, he had a fire hydrant out in front of the building.
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000 The fire hydrant actually broke off.
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000 And the pipes just started squirting.
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000 How big around is it?
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000 Is a fire hydrant?
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000 It's a 12 inches water or something.
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000 A 12 inch water line started spraying up and onto the top roof.
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.000 It's hot roof the building, which is no big deal because roofs are meant to take water.
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000 Well, what happened was the little drains, because it's a flat roof, the little drains
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000 up there.
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000 Since it doesn't rain a lot in California, they had debris and they filled up the drains filled
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000 up and then the next thing you don't, the roof just filled with water inside the parent
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000 pit wall and the roof collapsed.
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000 That was in the six months of opening up.
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000 I think we had just started making money.
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000 Boom.
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000 We got no.
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000 We got half the building is gone.
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000 The air conditioners from the second floor from the roof are on the bottom floor of the building.
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000 In the mixed martial arts area.
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.000 You know, this bad.
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000 But you know what I seem like a big disaster.
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000 Guess what?
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000 Get it.
00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000 Get it.
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000 Get it.
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000 Get it.
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000 Get it.
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000 Like move on.
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000 Guess what?
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000 The gym still ten years old still going strong.
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000 So these bad things are going to happen.
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000 These disasters are going to happen.
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000 But they're not permanent.
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000 They're the same thing.
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000 They're not going to last.
00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000 Don't rest on your laurels.
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000 Stay centered.
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000 So stay balanced.
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000 So did you guys end up clearing out the drains or what?
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000 The drains?
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000 Yeah.
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000 We cleared them out.
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000 Good idea.
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000 They late in the dollar short.
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000 Next.
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.000 If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken twisted by names to make a trap for fools.
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000 So you go out and you tell the truth.
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:51.000 And then the truth that you tell gets twisted around by some.
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000 Nave, which is an unscrupulous person.
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000 It's a dishonest person.
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000 Right?
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000 Let's bring that word back.
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000 Let's bring it back.
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000 They're going to twist your words and you're going to have to bear it.
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000 And the reason that this is what I think is interesting.
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000 The reason that you have to bear it is because if you get drawn into it, it's a trap.
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000 That you're going to get drawn into.
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000 If you start dealing with what?
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000 If you start going in and trying to.
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000 Trying to untwist this this.
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000 Lies that have been told about you.
00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000 It's a trap.
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000 That's what you say.
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000 It's almost like a battle you can't win.
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000 And by entering the battlefield you're going to get wounded.
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000 Yeah.
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000 So what is this like some you know how like someone will say something.
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000 I don't know.
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000 And it'll like involve race.
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000 Won't be racist but it'll like involve race because that's how the explanation pans out.
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000 You know on TV or something.
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000 And then someone else will come in and be like, oh my gosh this person's racist because
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000 Look what he said and maybe they'll play like you know the end part of the tape only or the beginning only or something like that.
00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000 And then someone else will be like, hey you know this interview.
00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000 You know they'll ask this question, hey did you say this?
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000 And they'll be like, well yeah I said that.
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000 Oh, it's an someone else will come and be like, look he even admitted he said this thing.
00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000 But then you know and then so that it just keeps getting twisted and twisted and twisted and twisted.
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000 It's like that.
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000 And then the more you explain it the more you're waiting wait you're saying you didn't say this.
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000 And when I did okay.
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000 Well you did or you didn't kind of you know it's like that.
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000 I think that's definitely part of it and probably that's it.
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000 I mean that that's it.
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000 When you go and try and unwind these things you're probably going to dig yourself a bigger whole.
00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000 I think that's the overall.
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000 Yeah.
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:30.000 Yeah.
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000 Yeah.
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000 Now are there times where people say something that's so horrible against you that you have to finish up.
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000 Sure.
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000 And I think when you do that you keep it simple.
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000 You keep it direct and then you walk away.
00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000 Right?
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000 Yeah.
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000 See look I would never have done that or I would never have said that or whatever.
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000 And that's all I'm gonna say walk away.
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000 Break the wrist walk away.
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000 Alright next.
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000 Or watch the things you gave your life to.
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000 Broken and stoop and build them up.
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000 With worn out tools.
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000 So you gave your life to whatever.
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000 Your life's works you gave it all and and that thing.
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000 Is broken.
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000 It's destroyed.
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000 And what you do is you stoop.
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.000 I like that word because what does that mean?
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000 They've been you bend it down.
00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000 That means you're bowing down.
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000 Right?
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000 You're having to get down.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000 You've to stoop down.
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000 You go to the ground and begin to rebuild.
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000 What has been destroyed and you do it with worn out.
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000 It's not worn out tools.
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000 Now we're not just talking about worn out physical tools like a hammer and a saw.
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000 We're talking about you.
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.000 We're talking about a worn out broken down you.
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.000 You are broken down and you're worn out.
00:36:53.000 --> 00:37:02.000 But you go anyway and you start from the beginning and you rebuild again.
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000 That's legit.
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000 Remember the game Contra?
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000 No.
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000 Okay.
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000 There's this game.
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000 I don't even know what that is.
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000 It's called Contra.
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000 I don't even know what that is.
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000 I don't even know what that is.
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000 I don't even know what that is.
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000 But there's this game named Contra.
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000 And then you know when you play Nintendo,
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000 No, this game was freaking awesome.
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000 This is code.
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000 It's basically these two guys.
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000 If you go one player, you go one player.
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000 Two players play in the same screen and you just go.
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000 It's like the basic side angle game.
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000 These commandal ram.
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000 You see the side angle.
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000 Side angle.
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000 Yeah.
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000 It's just a side angle.
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000 And it's these ram, both players.
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000 They play in the same screen.
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000 Against each other?
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000 No.
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000 With each other.
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000 So a boom.
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000 They kill bad guys.
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000 Through the game you can get different weapons.
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000 Okay.
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000 And each weapon is more and more effective.
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000 You can get the basic shooter is what you start with.
00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000 Then you have a machine gun.
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000 You just hold the button down.
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000 And you just machine gun.
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000 Then there's like a laser.
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000 They're just, you can go and it can just kill like five people in a row.
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000 Like that.
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000 And then there's the spreader.
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000 It's a spread gun.
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000 So at a side angle game, multi level kind of thing.
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000 The spreader.
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000 He just kills everybody.
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000 Boom.
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:17.000 Boom.
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000 So one.
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000 Can you kill your own person by accident?
00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000 No.
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000 No.
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000 Your bullets.
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000 No.
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000 It's not realistic.
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000 It's just useful.
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000 There are some unrealistic.
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000 You can't teach you about the spreader.
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000 Yeah.
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000 Well, teach you about blue on blue.
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000 Teach about fratur side.
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000 All right.
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000 You know human loss.
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000 I dig it.
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000 And that probably be a heavy game.
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000 But contra.
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000 It's not like that.
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000 So when you get the point is the point is following here.
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000 The point is when you get the spreader, you can make it super far.
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000 Because you're just killing.
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000 I would like to die if you have this infinite weapon.
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000 Bro, so someone can still kill you if you mess, you know, someone's shoot.
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000 Just like in the other way you can die.
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000 But since you have the spreader, that's just killing everyone.
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000 So easily you make it to high levels.
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000 It seems saying, but here's the thing about contra.
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000 When you get killed, you get like, you get three men.
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000 Right?
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000 I know unrealistic, but still.
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000 That's most video games.
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000 Anyway, you get three men.
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000 If you get killed, you lose the spreader.
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000 You start.
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000 You start again where you were, but you still, you get that piece shooter again.
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000 No one you first started with.
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000 So it's that same thing.
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000 So you go through all the levels.
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000 You work so hard to get the spreader.
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000 You know, is this, you have three men.
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000 You have three men. You have three lives.
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000 Here's the thing. Yeah, here's the okay, which is another thing about contra.
00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000 Which is so awesome.
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000 You have three lives, but if you know the code in the beginning of the game,
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000 you can get 30 lives.
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000 And here's the code up, down, down, left, right, left, right, be a.
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000 And press start.
00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000 That's the code. It gives you 30 lives.
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000 If everyone knows that.
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000 I'll, I want 100% guarantee that every single person, every single person.
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000 That is played contra, knows that code.
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000 Not even like 99%.
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000 100%
00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000 Yeah, because you get 10 times the amount of effectiveness.
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:57.000 Yeah.
00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000 But it's a secret code.
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000 It's not like it comes with a game like you got a free.
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000 100% of people.
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000 Well, that's exactly like 80, 80, not whenever that game
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000 free into webs.
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000 Free into, yeah, whatever they need.
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000 It'd be interesting to track how that information spread.
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000 Yeah.
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000 Back then, right?
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:14.000 Yeah.
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000 Back then, how did it spread?
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000 I bumped down, down, left, left, left, ab.
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000 How did that spread?
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000 It spread.
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000 There was no internet.
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000 There was no internet.
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000 Yeah.
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000 That's true.
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000 No viable internet.
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000 Yeah.
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000 That's true.
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000 The kids for them, sure, weren't on it.
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000 I don't know.
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000 So your point is that this taught you once you will use those worn out tools and
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000 you'll still try and go back and rebuild consciousness.
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000 Yeah.
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000 Like, those little, so bad kipling is dead to not be here to this.
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000 Bro, you apologize.
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000 If you understood the concept, you'd be like, you were exactly right.
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000 Because here's the thing, here's the listen to the practicality.
00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000 The listen to the sound of the kipling.
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000 Because with the spread, okay, if you just had the P shooter, right?
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000 We'll call it the P shooter that's the gun that you start with.
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000 If you start with that, it's really hard to make it to a high level.
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000 Because it's like the levels get harder and harder and you just got that P shooter, but
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000 those guys are going to kill you.
00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000 But if you get the spreader, it's the exact opposite.
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000 You can smash through levels.
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000 Right.
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000 And some of the levels that they end, you've got to have a powerful weapon to beat the boss.
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000 You seem to say, so if you have the spreader, you can get the same.
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000 Spreader, you can get pretty far.
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000 What's I've heard people who use the term boss?
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000 Is there a term called King Boss or main boss or end boss?
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000 End boss?
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000 End boss?
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000 And this is a universal term.
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000 Maybe with video games.
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000 With video games, right?
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000 And that's my question.
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000 Bosses.
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000 But would we know where the term originated from?
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000 The boss, who is the original end boss?
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000 I don't know.
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000 There's a video that someone made that's really, really funny.
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000 It's called, it's something about me.
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000 And it's a German guy.
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000 And it's like, how did Jockel willing get so massive?
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000 Yeah.
00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000 Have you seen that video?
00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000 What was it?
00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000 He just makes a video where he breaks down how I got so massive.
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000 Y'all, yay, it's hilarious.
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000 But one thing he goes, this is the end boss to kill all the end bosses.
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000 And I didn't really know what an end boss was.
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000 So I googled it and figured out that it's from the video game world.
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000 And boss, do you remember the date of that?
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000 Is it like a old school game like Atari?
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000 Oh, no, no, no, no.
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000 It's the video game world.
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000 No, no, no, no.
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000 The video game world.
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000 The video game.
00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000 Do you, you were a little taken back?
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000 Or when you were a musician?
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000 Man, world.
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000 I'll just play that.
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000 Give it my spreader.
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000 I'll go get some levels.
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000 There's a thing called Kung Fu.
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000 And a reason on the Nintendo's called Kung Fu.
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000 Five levels.
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000 But then they repeat.
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000 And they get harder and harder.
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000 But there's five levels.
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000 And they, I think in the game, it called them the boss.
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000 Like the first level boss.
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000 That might be in the second level.
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000 But I'm sure, I'm sure there's, because there's other older game bosses.
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000 Oh, no.
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000 Nonetheless.
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000 Well, Kipling would say because, oh, the point is when you get the spreader.
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000 Kipling.
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000 You're in contra when you get the spreader.
00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000 If you go, you'll make it to a high level.
00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000 You will.
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000 But here's the thing, that high level is super hard.
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000 So you need that spreader.
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000 And if you get hit and you die, and you know when you come back to life or whatever,
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000 you got the P shooter, you find yourself like this with worn out tools.
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000 That's what you find yourself.
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000 And it's hard.
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000 And if you put your mind to it, you can get that spreader again.
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000 But it's really hard.
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000 Super hard.
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000 Anyone who play contra will, will attach to that.
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.000 I think that right there is, we'll leave it at that.
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:24.000 No.
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000 That's my recommendation.
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000 All right.
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000 Next.
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.000 If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on a one turn of pitch and toss.
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:42.000 And lose and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss.
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000 Never breathe a word about your loss.
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000 Isn't it when you meet someone?
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000 And you, you talk to them and you deal with them for a while.
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000 And they don't tell you anything about their background.
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000 And then you find out like later that they've been through some big struggle.
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000 And so much more impactful and impressive.
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000 Yeah.
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000 Then when they're like, hey, I did this and I went through that night.
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000 You know, just, I got a good idea.
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000 Just be quiet.
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000 Don't breathe a word about your loss.
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000 Yeah.
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000 Just move, just perform.
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000 Yeah.
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000 And this is also about being willing to take risk.
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000 A willing to take risk.
00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000 This seems like an inappropriate risk to risk everything that you have on a single turn of pitch and toss.
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000 Doesn't seem like a smart risk.
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000 No.
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000 I don't know about that one.
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000 Yeah.
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000 Take it easy.
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000 I'm going to say, let's, let's dial the dichotomy back of the extreme bedding situation.
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000 Right.
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000 That being said, you absolutely have to take risks in life.
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000 Right.
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000 Like you got to do something.
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000 You got to just risk like a teeny tiny thing.
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000 Got to be a risk no reward.
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000 But let's not risk everything in one turn of pitch and toss.
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000 Let's not do that.
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000 Next, if you can force your heart and nerve and sinu,
00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000 to serve your turn long after they are gone,
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000 that's just awesome.
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000 Right.
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000 We're talking about forcing your heart and your nerve and your sinu and sinu is a,
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:15.000 basically means your tendons and your legaments and the things that hold your muscles and your bones together.
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000 And you know who used Shakespeare used sinu quite a bit.
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000 Because it's just like the core element.
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000 But this is like saying you will get you will force your body and your mind to do what you do.
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000 You're trying to do what you need them to do.
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000 Even when they're done, they're done.
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000 You're going to force them to do more.
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000 When they have nothing left to give,
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000 you're going to force them to give anyways.
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000 And then it rolls right into the next line, the next line.
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.000 And so hold on when there is nothing in you accept the will,
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000 which says to them, hold on.
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000 Good.
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000 Nothing left but will.
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000 Hmm.
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.000 Force of will.
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000 To make.
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000 Make them make.
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000 Make your heart.
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000 It make your nerve.
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000 Make them whole the lines.
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000 If you can talk with crowds.
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000 And keep your vote virtue.
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000 Or walk with kings.
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000 Nor lose the common touch.
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000 So this is again, this is staying balance.
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000 This is that caught me.
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000 No matter if you're involved with the masses.
00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000 You don't lose your virtue.
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000 Or if you're rubbing elbows with the rich in powerful with the kings.
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000 You don't lose that common touch.
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000 You stay grounded.
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000 You don't lose the ability to communicate with people.
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000 Up and down the chain of command from a leadership perspective.
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000 No matter what station someone is in life.
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000 You remember, remember, episode five of this podcast.
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000 I read a counseling letter to a good guy.
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000 And I was like, hey, treat everyone respect.
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000 O one or E one to O ten.
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000 Like it doesn't matter what rank someone is he treated with respect.
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000 No matter what.
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000 Don't lose that.
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000 Next, if neither friends nor loving.
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000 If either if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you.
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000 This is what's interesting.
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000 It is an always your enemy's at hurt you.
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000 In fact, it's quite the opposite.
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000 Usually the people that hurt you the most are the people that are closest to you.
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000 Those are the ones that really put the dagger in and twist it.
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000 So you got to be above that.
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000 You got to...
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000 You got to kind of insulate yourself from that.
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000 You can't leave that last little bit of exposure.
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000 In my opinion, you got to keep a little bit.
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.000 You got to keep a little bit.
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000 You got to keep a...
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:57.000 You got to put yourself in a situation where you're not going to get crushed by your foes or by the people that you're close to.
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000 Yeah.
00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000 It's hard.
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.000 Got to keep it in.
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000 It is hard.
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000 It is hard.
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000 Guys get jammed up.
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000 Really get into echo Charles terminology.
00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000 That jams people up all the time.
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000 The enemy doesn't jam people up as bad as the the friends.
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000 Right?
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000 Yeah.
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000 Because the enemy expect that.
00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000 You expect them to jam you.
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000 Yeah.
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000 But this goes back to the original.
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000 What we talked about earlier.
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000 The person...
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000 And we've talked about this on the podcast.
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000 The person that hurts you really bad that was your friend.
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000 They weren't your friend.
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000 Yeah.
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000 They didn't exist.
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000 Yeah.
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000 You thought you knew them.
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000 You thought you understood them.
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000 You thought they were trustworthy.
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000 They weren't.
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000 So just we have to just look at it and say look.
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000 That person that I wasn't loved with or that person that I thought was going to be with me all the time.
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000 Guess what that person doesn't exist.
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000 So we got to move on.
00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000 So you got to keep I think a little bit.
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000 And this might sound cold blooded.
00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000 Right?
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000 It sounds a little bit cold blooded.
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000 You got to keep some stuff.
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000 You got to keep perspective.
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000 You got to keep people in check.
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:08.000 And if you let them get in to the point where they can grip you apart, you're going to be careful.
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000 Got to be careful who you decide you're going to do that with.
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000 Real careful.
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000 Yeah.
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000 Yeah.
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000 Or you or this is I think what I do is more like this.
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000 If that happens, I recognize it.
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000 Okay.
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000 This is what happened.
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000 That person wasn't who I thought they were moving on.
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000 Yeah.
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000 We're moving on.
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000 Yeah.
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000 That's a question.
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000 You know what I mean?
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000 We're moving on.
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000 Yeah.
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000 So I guess maybe I have the ability.
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000 I shouldn't say that.
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000 I have the ability.
00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.000 I think I learned along the way.
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000 Hey.
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:47.000 Once someone exposes themselves reveals themselves as a as a naiv.
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000 Right.
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000 As a naiv.
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000 Once they revealed themselves as a naiv, I'm over it.
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000 I'm moving on.
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000 Because they've exposed.
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000 They've revealed great.
00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:01.000 I'm actually happy that now I don't have to invest anymore time effort into this person.
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000 That's a naiv.
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000 A wretched naiv.
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000 Yeah.
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000 And then you have this kind of.
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000 How should I say over-developed control of your emotions?
00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000 We'll call it where like the average person is like,
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.000 It's kind of like if you built a house, right?
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000 Mm-hmm.
00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000 You built a house on a call.
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000 And it's a nice house to live there for 10 years, 15 years, even.
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000 A lot of memories in that house.
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000 Maybe we've been had some kids.
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000 Whatever.
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000 First dog.
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000 All that stuff.
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000 And then her cane comes.
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000 And then she goes, it blows it down.
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000 Right?
00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000 There's really nothing you could have done.
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000 You know, like if you had a girlfriend, then she doesn't have the signs of being a naiv.
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000 But then maybe she changed.
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000 Maybe she was at all along.
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000 I don't know.
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000 She be as it turns out.
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000 Nave.
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000 The house gets blown down.
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000 Okay.
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000 Girlfriends gone.
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000 You can either easily say, Hey, that wasn't the girl that I loved.
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000 Mm-hmm.
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000 All this stuff.
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000 Okay.
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000 We're moving on.
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000 Obviously, you got to move on.
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000 Right?
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000 She's a naiv.
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000 Yeah.
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000 But you can't just be like, You're just moving on.
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000 What about all those memories?
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000 Oh, this is your turn with the hurricane.
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000 I'm talking about both.
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000 So yeah, I'll go back to the hurricane.
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000 The memories relies.
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000 The memories.
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000 The memories.
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000 The memories.
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.000 Yeah, but emotionally it doesn't count.
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000 Yes, what?
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000 You're free.
00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000 Okay.
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:19.000 So free.
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000 You've got to wait.
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000 That's the escape.
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000 Okay.
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000 That's good.
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000 That's good.
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000 But you're talking about like, how much you learned?
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:28.000 You learned that you gave me careful.
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000 But see what I'm saying though.
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000 Like your sense of like emotional control allows you to
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000 go boom, right?
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000 Do that.
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:33.000 One right.
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000 And what's such you want is fresh like you can't just, oh, yeah.
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000 Look how much I learned.
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000 Yeah.
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000 Let's get moving on.
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000 That's not the normal person.
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000 No, and the person has still has open wounds from because yesterday that house was intact.
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000 Yeah, but all the memories.
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000 And I'll remember to rebuild that kitchen and let me feel we could flow.
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000 Right?
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000 You're going to get me.
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.000 You're just going straight to the positive thing, which is the good thing to do, which is the right thing to do.
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000 But whether it capability wise the average person can't do that.
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000 So no, it's going to be a little bit tricky, but what are the options?
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000 It will be a little bit of options.
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000 There's no options.
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000 The option is, oh, I'm going to be distressed and mourn the loss of my house.
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000 More than the loss of your house.
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000 Do it for a, you know, four days.
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:16.000 Yeah.
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000 There should be a limitation.
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000 Yeah.
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000 That's a good idea.
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.000 I'll be like, hey, one week right now.
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000 I'm going to just let my emotions just be my emotions.
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000 Yeah.
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000 Try not to like a week too long.
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000 Yeah.
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000 For a house for sure.
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000 That's one of the things that I want for the girlfriend.
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000 Yeah.
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000 For a girlfriend?
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.000 Yeah.
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.000 That's a bit better.
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:36.000 People go month.
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000 No, people go years.
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000 People talk about it for years.
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000 That's not good.
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000 That's what I'm saying.
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:42.000 That's my point.
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000 See, it said, it's making me sound like I'm all cold blooded over here.
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:52.000 Well, what you should say is like, hey, I wish that some of the people that I know that wreck their lives over a girlfriend,
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.000 boyfriend, husband, wife that broke up with them and they let it ruin their lives.
00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:02.000 I wish you'd say, hey, I wish that they would have had enough to emotional control to say, you know what?
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000 All right.
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.000 This day three, they're not coming back.
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000 I have two choices.
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:15.000 Dig a whole climb in it, never come out or step up, make things happen.
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000 Move forward.
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000 The choice is obvious.
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.000 And once you step up and you start moving forward in three years, you'll remember that person's name anymore.
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000 There are no factor.
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000 Yeah.
00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000 There are no factor.
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000 Yeah, man.
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000 Yeah.
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000 So what's the, I mean, obviously it's going to be dependent on what kind of person it is.
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000 So I've talked about this.
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:40.000 Like, we don't have a good, a good system when someone dies in America.
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:47.000 We don't really know what to do because in other countries, in other cultures, they have a specific ritual that they go through.
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.000 And in America, our rituals are kind of all jam together.
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000 And then we don't really know what the right ritual is.
00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000 Right.
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000 We don't even know how to dispose of the body.
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000 Do we burn it?
00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.000 Do we bury it?
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000 Do we bury it?
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000 See, like there's all these options.
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000 Do you donate your organs?
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000 Do you not?
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000 Do you donate to your body to science?
00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.000 What do we, what are you supposed to do?
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000 What's the right thing to do?
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000 We don't even know that.
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000 We even know what to do with someone's body.
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000 So how are we supposed to know what we're supposed to do emotionally when someone dies?
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000 What do we supposed to do?
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000 Yeah.
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000 We don't have a physical ritual to do.
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000 So what now do we do?
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000 Yeah.
00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000 There should be rules.
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000 Yeah.
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000 If a protocol broke up with significant other.
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:30.000 Here's the protocol.
00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.000 Yeah.
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000 One day morning.
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000 One pizza.
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000 Extra cheese.
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000 Paparoni.
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:38.000 Sausage.
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.000 Right.
00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000 Mint chocolate chip milkshake.
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000 Sure.
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000 Cool.
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000 Next day.
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000 Fuck.
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000 No.
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000 No.
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000 No.
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.000 I don't recommend it.
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000 I don't either.
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000 I don't even know what to do.
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.000 The next day I was like, what I was going to say is like, I was going to say eight
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000 mile run.
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000 Eight mile run.
00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000 That's just what you got to do.
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000 Yeah.
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000 Hey.
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000 Oh, I brought you to do it tomorrow.
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000 Yeah.
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000 Where we're going to go from today.
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000 I got to go to the hospital.
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000 That's part of the protocol.
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000 Yeah.
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.000 Oh, yo, yo.
00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000 And there could be different levels.
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000 Oh, I was going out with her for every.
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000 Let's say for every three months that you were with her.
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000 That's one mile.
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000 Okay.
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000 Yeah.
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000 And so then you do that.
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000 And we get done with that.
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000 Guess what you got to do.
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.000 You got to do a contrast baths ice hot ice hot.
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000 You got to do that four times, right?
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000 Yeah.
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000 No, what you do is a good protocol for a contrast baths.
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000 Five minutes ice five minutes heat.
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000 Four minutes ice four minutes you go back and forth.
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000 When you get done with that boom, you come out.
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000 You clenced.
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000 And then guess what?
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000 Twenty four hour fast.
00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.000 Right.
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000 Twenty four hour.
00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:42.000 Well, that is actually kind of sounds weird.
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000 Like for a breakup.
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000 But so many cultures do that.
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000 Oh, yeah.
00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:47.000 You got a fast.
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000 So, and so then we could go on and on, but you make a protocol.
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000 It's a three day protocol generally.
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000 And then boom.
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000 Now we come out of that protocol.
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000 And then there's one last.
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000 The last thing on the protocol is like.
00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000 Go to work or.
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000 You know, begin normal routine.
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000 Back to normal routine.
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000 You go to bed.
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000 Back to, oh, I know the final protocols wake up.
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000 Whatever time it is you get up in the morning.
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000 Third, fourth day.
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000 Now the protocol has been completed.
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000 Fourth day.
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000 Boom.
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.000 Wake up.
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.000 Get busy.
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.000 Get on with it.
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000 Get after it.
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000 That's what I'm talking about.
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000 So we don't have that.
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000 So if you, if you put in your mind.
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000 I think for me.
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000 I recognize when something is dragging me.
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000 This is dragging me in the wrong direction.
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000 As soon as I see something dragging me in the wrong direction.
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000 I know like an internal protocols like,
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000 Okay, I'm emotionally attached to this situation.
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000 It's not beneficial to me.
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000 It's not beneficial to me.
00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.000 It's not going to help me.
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000 It's not going to help me.
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000 Understand the nature of the world.
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.000 It's not going to help me move forward with my life.
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000 It's not going to help me in any way.
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000 Guess what I'm going to do.
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.000 I'm going to detach.
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000 We're going to take a little step away from that thing.
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.000 Because I'm not saying emotions are bad.
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000 Emotions are great.
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000 That's what makes a human beings.
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000 I get emotional on this podcast.
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.000 Right?
00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000 That's not bad.
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000 That's actually good.
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000 Makes me understand myself and other things in the world better.
00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:07.000 But that's a positive effect of emotions.
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.000 But if I start having negative emotions and they start dragging me down,
00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000 protocol.
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000 Yeah.
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000 Execute the protocol.
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:14.000 Boom.
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000 That's what we need to do.
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000 Yeah.
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000 Like what if part of the protocol was to shave your head or something or anything?
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000 Yeah.
00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.000 For sure.
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000 Yeah.
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000 That could be right.
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000 And then let's say you break up with your girlfriend or something.
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:30.000 And then like, you know, a few days later you see her at the post office.
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000 There's some shit that shaved at you.
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000 Oh man.
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000 She's getting over me quick.
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000 Do you have the same thing?
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000 Yeah.
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000 But that would help though.
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000 That would.
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000 It totally would.
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000 Because it's like the process.
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000 And it gives you something else to focus on.
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000 It's like, okay, I think we're talking about the protocol.
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000 The protocol.
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:46.000 Yeah.
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000 It's a protocol.
00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000 Special feedback expands like, you know, three, four days.
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000 Boom, boom, boom.
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.000 It's like, you know, doesn't AA have something like that too.
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:54.000 Yeah.
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000 All kinds of things.
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000 Yeah.
00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000 All kinds of things.
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.000 There's a reason protocols exist because it gives you something to follow.
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000 You don't have to think about it and it moves you in the right direction.
00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.000 Yeah.
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000 So think about that for your life.
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000 Pay attention to it.
00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000 Because this scary part about this.
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000 And we talk about this too.
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000 It's like the storm.
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.000 Your head's in a storm.
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000 And you can't get out and get only person.
00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:17.000 Everyone else can see that your head has a has a has a two foot cloud around it.
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:20.000 And everybody can see if you just move in a direction.
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000 You'll get away from that cloud.
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000 But everywhere you look, you just see storm is.
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.000 Thunder and lightning.
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000 So you don't think there's any way out.
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000 But there is.
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000 You've got to actually keep the protocol.
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000 The period protocol is you go do north.
00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:32.000 1800 meters.
00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.000 You're going to be out.
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:33.000 Right.
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:34.000 That's what's going to happen.
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000 Shave your head.
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.000 Run eight miles.
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.000 Eat a pizza.
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000 Eat a mint chocolate chip.
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000 Milk shake.
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.000 That's day one.
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.000 That's a little comfort.
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:42.000 Yeah.
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.000 Little luxury.
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000 Theo Von luxury style.
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.000 Yeah.
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000 Yeah.
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000 With that.
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.000 That's good.
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000 All right.
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000 Next.
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:56.000 We went way off on that one.
00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000 That was actually really good.
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000 That kind of gets you thinking.
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.000 Because if you you could even do this right now.
00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000 If you're in even if you're in a release,
00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000 even if you're not even in a relationship yet.
00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.000 Because those are the ones.
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.000 Right.
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000 Just get prepared protocol.
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000 Yeah.
00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000 Because it's kind of like an actual disaster.
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.000 You do that.
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000 You know what?
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000 There's also something you could do.
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000 That would be helpful.
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.000 And I hate to use this word because it gets used in a different sense these days.
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000 But you can have trigger points, right?
00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:23.000 Things that happen.
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000 Where if you see if you identify things happening, you go, okay.
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000 If I get involved in this situation and this happens,
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000 that's a trigger that means I need to walk.
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.000 Right.
00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.000 For instance,
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.000 let's say you have someone that has let's say let's say you meet someone that
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000 was an addict of some kind.
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000 On alcoholic.
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000 And you're like, okay, if this person starts drinking,
00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000 that's my trigger, I'm going to walk.
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.000 Because you don't want to go down that spiral with them.
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.000 Right.
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000 Or you whatever the case may be.
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000 You have someone that used to date some other guy.
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.000 Like, hey, if I see that there's whatever a Facebook connection again.
00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.000 I'm walking.
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.000 Whatever.
00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000 Like you figure out these things.
01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000 And that way you predetermine them when you're in a non-emotional state.
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000 Yeah.
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000 Hopefully you can overcome your emotions.
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000 Because there's people that I don't care.
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000 I love them.
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000 I love her.
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000 I'm just going to keep going.
01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000 There's only this one time.
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000 Right.
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000 Yep.
01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000 She friended me.
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000 Right.
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000 And then they stick around.
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000 But if you have your protocol in place,
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000 if you have the triggers to execute upon,
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000 it's going to make it easier for you.
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000 It should make it easier for you.
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000 Hmm.
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000 Alright.
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000 Next one.
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000 This is a good one.
01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000 If all men count with you, but none too much.
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000 And think about this one.
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000 And I actually got wrapped around this one a little bit in the podcast one time.
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000 Because this is a dichotomy of the fact that I personally,
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000 there's part of me that doesn't care what anyone thinks.
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000 And then there's part of me that completely cares about what people,
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000 specifically people that I have a lot of respect for.
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000 I care what they think a lot.
01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000 Hmm.
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000 And people that I don't respect, I don't care what they think.
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000 So there's a dichotomy there.
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000 That's similar to what is being said here.
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000 If all men count with you, so you take their opinions, you understand.
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000 But at the same time, none too much to sway you from the path.
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000 Hmm.
01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000 And here, next line.
01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000 I think this one grows on it, my endeavor.
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:29.000 If you can kill, if you can fill the unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run.
01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:33.000 The unforgiving minute.
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000 That's a great.
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.000 That's the way you should think of every minute, every minute that exists for you is unforgiving.
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.000 Because it does not stop, it does not forgive and you can't have it back.
01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:52.000 That's the unforgiving minute time has no mercy on anyone.
01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.000 And what he's saying here is if you can fill every one of those unforgiving minutes of your life.
01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:06.000 Every single one of them with a full 60 seconds of you running and moving forward and getting after it.
01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:17.000 If you can push that hard, if you can push that hard, then he closes out yours is the earth and everything that's in it.
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:24.000 And which is more, you'll be a man, my son.
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.000 So, there it is. If you can do all those things and that's the name of the poem.
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000 If you can do those things, those things that are simple but not easy.
01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000 Simple but definitely not easy.
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.000 Then the world will be yours and you will be a man.
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:56.000 And in the most positive possible way. So now we go back. This is what we do.
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:03.000 Now that we understand it fully, we go through it fully.
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:13.000 Here it goes. If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming them.
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:24.000 If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you but make allowance for their doubting too.
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:41.000 If you can wait and not be tired by waiting or being lied about don't deal lies or being hated don't give way to hating and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise.
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000 If you can dream and not make dreams your master.
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:52.000 If you can think and not make thoughts your aim.
01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:01.000 If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same.
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:15.000 If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken, twisted by naves to make a trap for fools or watch the things you gave your life to broken.
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000 And stoop and build them up with worn out tools.
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:37.000 If you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss and lose and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss.
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:57.000 If you can force your heart and nerve and sinu to serve your turn long after they are gone and so hold on when there is nothing in you except the will which says to them hold on.
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:16.000 If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue or walk with kings nor lose the common touch if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you if all man count with you but none too much.
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:28.000 If you can feel the unforgiving minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run yours is the earth and everything that's in it.
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:35.000 And which is more you'll be a man my son.
01:05:35.000 --> 01:06:04.000 And there you have it some pretty straightforward instructions from kipling on how to live and I looked at it in his son died in World War I he wrote this poem just before the turn of the centuries who he wrote this poem before his son was killed before his son went to war perhaps just after his son was born in that time frame.
01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000 So I'm sure his son grew up with these thoughts.
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000 And I think it's thoughts that we can all use.
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000 So kipling thank you.
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:24.000 And now we are going to go through some Q&A.
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000 Dig into a little bit of Q&A.
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000 Echo Charles.
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000 First question.
01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:41.000 Okay, jockel many times you said that liking a fight or liking two fight should be a part of every man's personality could you expand on that.
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:51.000 I've always been interested in martial arts but I've always been reluctant to fight and I would do anything not to does that make me less of a man.
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000 So obviously this is a pretty fitting question for the situation.
01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:04.000 Yeah. So this is obviously a good question and a fitting question talking about being a man.
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:16.000 I don't know if I said liking to fight should be a part of everybody's every man's personality or if I said that it is part of every man's personality.
01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:35.000 And I think I said is part of the personality and if I said that what I think I should have said is most right most men have in their personality some level of interest of fighting right we wrestle we box we we scrap as kids look at the UFC.
01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000 Right why is the UFC so popular right now because it's fighting.
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:49.000 And we have that that's a I read the other that's a seven billion dollar organization that's a there's a lot of people watching those fights.
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:57.000 A lot of people want to watch those fights we have boxing we have wrestling we have jiu-jitsu we have jiu-jiu we have moitai we got all kinds of martial arts schools.
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:09.000 So while I don't think the desire to fight is inherent in all men right I'm sure there's men out there that are not into it at all but I think it's definitely a a pretty strong part of many men now.
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000 For this individual particular.
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:19.000 Do do I think that being reluctant to fight makes you less than a man no actually I think it's fine.
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:27.000 You should be reluctant to fight I think everyone should be reluctant fight there's a lot of bad things it can happen to fight a lot of bad things you know first of all you can hurt.
01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000 Right that's bad you can get seriously hurt you can get killed.
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:42.000 You can get killed you can get punch one time fall down hit a curb and die you can think you're going to get in a fair fight with someone they can stab you in the neck and kill you right these things can happen.
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:55.000 Even if it's not that bad you can hurt someone else now you're getting lawsuit now you're getting put in prison right so there's all kinds of bad things so being reluctant to fight is actually a good thing it's something that men should have.
01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:03.000 And actually the more you know about fighting the more reluctant you will be I was way the less I knew in my life about fighting the more.
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:13.000 Sorry the more I actually knew about fighting the more reluctant I became to fight because I realized all the risks that are involved part of that was maturity sure.
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000 But the reality is you look at someone you go I don't know who that person is.
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:32.000 A they they might be training I'm over here thinking I've been training but you just two for eight months. I'm ready to kick this guy's ass. Meanwhile, you don't know that guy is a purple belt guess what's going to happen to you you're getting crushed or that guy wrestled in high school he's about to double like you and slam you on a curb.
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000 You're going to die.
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:46.000 So you should be reluctant to fight that's a good thing now that being said.
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000 I do recommend that you are prepared to fight.
01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:57.000 I definitely recommend that and there's going to be a big dichotomy here I'm going to get to but you should know some basics right you should understand for that you should not have content with other people.
01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:05.000 You should you know you should know some boxing you should know some wrestling you should know some more I should know some you just to for sure.
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.000 Because here's the dichotomy this is the this is a big dichotomy and think about it it's a hundred percent true.
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.000 If this this individual says he would do anything not to fight.
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:26.96 Would do anything not to fight let me tell you the best thing you can do as a human so that you don't have to fight is actually learn how to fight that is the best way to
01:10:26.96 --> 01:10:33.96 not have to fight is if you know how to fight if you know how to fight people are going to want to fight you you don't have to say anything they can tell.
01:10:33.96 --> 01:10:39.96 You can tell when you meet somebody. You can tell if that person oh if you're ready to fight.
01:10:39.96 --> 01:10:44.96 People don't want to fight you the more eager you are to fight the less people want to fight you.
01:10:44.96 --> 01:10:52.96 If you don't know how to fight and and bullies because that's what we're talking about bullies see that you don't want to fight guess who they're coming after you.
01:10:52.96 --> 01:11:02.96 Now you have to fight but if you know how to fight and you have that confidence and you have that understanding and you learn simple things like avoidance and you learn you have better situational awareness.
01:11:02.96 --> 01:11:09.96 You become a threat to the people that want to fight you you become a threat to them just by just by your knowledge alone.
01:11:09.96 --> 01:11:11.96 So.
01:11:11.96 --> 01:11:14.96 No you're not less of a man.
01:11:14.96 --> 01:11:28.96 Because you're elected to fight you actually should be reluctant to fight but you should learn how to fight because the best way to avoid fighting the more equipped and prepared to fight you are the less you will have to fight.
01:11:28.96 --> 01:11:39.96 The less you will be put in positions where you have to fight and the better the outcome will be if it does happen to occur.
01:11:39.96 --> 01:11:47.96 Yeah, interestingly like a lot of the people that you meet in Gigi to or just like this where I'm interested in martial arts, but I'm not interested in fighting no better.
01:11:47.96 --> 01:11:49.96 You know for sure and then they learned and then they get off.
01:11:49.96 --> 01:11:57.96 Well there's a strong component of nerds in Gigi to right strong component really strong.
01:11:57.96 --> 01:12:11.96 You know people I'm saying it jokingly but there's just a studio type.
01:12:11.96 --> 01:12:22.96 Yeah, this is a game that I can learn and then I can crush and that's good and now I have more confidence on it for worry about anymore.
01:12:22.96 --> 01:12:32.96 Again, it's interesting how that third or that additional element that they're not really used to like how you say nerds and you know, we'll just say like people who are more cerebral within physical.
01:12:32.96 --> 01:12:36.96 You know it's that maybe they play high school sports right.
01:12:36.96 --> 01:12:40.96 Yeah, because they were starting because they were working on a computer right cool right on yeah.
01:12:40.96 --> 01:12:51.96 They were playing music right yeah whatever yeah and then now they get into this highly physical situation because due to let's face it it's physical that's your whole body it is physical and contact point.
01:12:51.96 --> 01:13:00.96 Yeah, but you get in it and you're just finding success just by learning it it's not like football where it's like sure I know how to catch.
01:13:00.96 --> 01:13:11.96 I can't run fast though and I can't I'm not big and strong or whatever so I'm just getting smashed you know I can but this it's kind of like the more you know the better you are kind of think and sure physical attributes help you for sure about it.
01:13:11.96 --> 01:13:22.96 Yeah, there's there's being stronger is great. Yeah, you know Dean was talking about this today on the map.
01:13:22.96 --> 01:13:40.96 Sometimes they do there's various categories that will bring you a victory one of the strongest categories that you can have well the this strong these strongest category is your technique known what to do is known what to do and so you you're smart people.
01:13:40.96 --> 01:13:53.96 I'm not sure if you can find this knowledge the same way I apply my skills in accounting James Nielsen world's toughest account.
01:13:53.96 --> 01:14:07.96 Yeah, and that's why so now they're in that's why people get addicted to because it's like this element of physicality like a physical fighting mark fighting sport by the way combat sport.
01:14:07.96 --> 01:14:28.96 And they're still smart as smart can be you know like they always were so now they got that and that additional like pay off you know that's where they get it to power yeah I recognize that with kids that come to you to the often times and it's not always often times the kids that get really into you to our kids that are smart.
01:14:28.96 --> 01:14:39.96 But they haven't done a lot of other sports yet and it's exactly what you're saying you need to very noticeable with kids. The kid that play baseball is all life and he comes in there he actually doesn't like it at first.
01:14:39.96 --> 01:14:51.96 And maybe doesn't want to do it because he's getting choked by someone that seems all nerdy to him. And he knows I could throw baseball for this guy and so it makes him mad and he doesn't want to train.
01:14:51.96 --> 01:15:10.96 Often times it's the kids that come in that really haven't done too much athletically and you know they got picked on we've I've had a lot of bullies come to my digital kids program. The reason they're there is because they got bullied and once they start training six months they're not getting bullied anymore and a year later they're a different person they're different kid.
01:15:10.96 --> 01:15:22.96 But in assures themselves not backing down not being jerks not being bullies themselves but just confident. Yeah.
01:15:22.96 --> 01:15:37.96 All right next question. Jocco and echo question. How important is personal intelligence in the military particularly in more dangerous roles as compared to physical strength.
01:15:37.96 --> 01:15:55.96 I'm a college student who will probably go to OCS officer candidates go. Yeah. So this has been on my mind. Well, okay, so intelligence is paramount right of course. If you aren't smart they're going to do dumb things and dumb things can definitely get you killed.
01:15:55.96 --> 01:16:09.96 This is not to say that if you do dumb things you will get killed because I did some really dumb things it combat and I didn't get killed and it certainly isn't to say that if you get killed you did something dumb because
01:16:09.96 --> 01:16:22.96 I'm to combat as no mercy and you can be the best trained the smartest and most tackler sound person in the world. And those people can still get killed combat doesn't care about any of that that bullet.
01:16:22.96 --> 01:16:39.96 There has no one's name on it. It the bomb has no one's name on it. It's going to go off and it's going to take out who it takes out and that's that. But it's far as weighing you know intelligence and cognitive power versus strength.
01:16:39.96 --> 01:17:01.96 And you have to be isn't I would rather be smart and being smart is very important because if you're smart if you aren't smart I should say you you increase your chance of doing something that isn't smart and then you're going to make some kind of mistake that will negatively impact you so yes, being smart is very important now.
01:17:01.96 --> 01:17:12.96 In cases without question where physical strength and stamina is at least as important and sometimes more important.
01:17:12.96 --> 01:17:17.96 That's just the way it is you might have to climb a cliff to escape the enemy.
01:17:17.96 --> 01:17:29.96 That's just the way it is you might have to swing Mike Thornton Mike Thornton swam for what five hours dragging two people. Now he could be the smartest guy in the world.
01:17:29.96 --> 01:17:39.96 And which he did a damn good job of you know getting the life jackets and getting him a self organizing a situation where it'd be the easiest possible way for him to swim even with that.
01:17:39.96 --> 01:17:54.96 You still got to swim for five hours dragging two people while you're wounded by the way. So if he didn't have that physical strength at that point that brain wouldn't matter it wouldn't matter.
01:17:54.96 --> 01:18:13.96 So what's interesting about this is guess what a really smart person will get himself or herself the physical capabilities that's what you'll do the smart person the really smart person will work their ass off to get in shape and to stay in shape.
01:18:13.96 --> 01:18:23.96 Because you can be smart to come up with the most brilliant plan in the world but if you don't have the physical where we fall to execute that plan then that that brilliant plan doesn't matter.
01:18:23.96 --> 01:18:40.96 So yes you want to be smart and yes you want to be physically strong you want to exercise your brain and your body as much as possible and get them both as mentally strong physically get yourself as mentally strong as physically strong as you possibly can and that's not just in the.
01:18:40.96 --> 01:18:43.96 In the military that's in life.
01:18:43.96 --> 01:19:02.96 Life. Somebody quoted on Twitter the other day you if you two you can't you don't know two plus two if you're dead but you can't add two plus so if you're if you're investing all your time in being smart or you're investing all your time and in that intellectual aspect of your life.
01:19:02.96 --> 01:19:13.96 And then you let your physical aspect go well guess what now you're now you're unhealthy now you die because you can take here you now what good is your brain now zero group zero good.
01:19:13.96 --> 01:19:15.96 Good.
01:19:15.96 --> 01:19:18.96 Check.
01:19:18.96 --> 01:19:20.96 Next wish.
01:19:20.96 --> 01:19:34.96 Jockel how do you give feedback to someone without everyone taking it personal I try to give criticism regarding their work or actions while not attacking their character but unfortunately many feel that it's personal.
01:19:34.96 --> 01:19:37.96 Yeah welcome to the world.
01:19:37.96 --> 01:19:45.96 People don't like criticism criticism and I almost put a.
01:19:45.96 --> 01:19:56.96 No one in the world like scripts. Okay, so there might be 0.001% of the world that's really like open and ready for feedback right.
01:19:56.96 --> 01:20:10.96 But most people even when they said even when they tell you they want feedback they don't want it they don't want it like let me let me give you an example if you echo Charles yes would like you you made a video and it took you now right don't even.
01:20:10.96 --> 01:20:16.96 Right, you know what I'm saying like you could come to me and say hey what do you think and I was like well you know I think you framed this up wrong.
01:20:16.96 --> 01:20:22.96 How what what's your reaction to that I mean there's no possible way that you're stoked on that there just don't now luckily.
01:20:22.96 --> 01:20:32.96 You know we know each other you can be attached to be like all right and he just he doesn't he's not pointing this out to me for no reason whatever but what I'm saying is even when you're saying hey what do you think of this.
01:20:32.96 --> 01:20:40.96 And I criticize something that you work so hard on there's no one in the world that's happy about that even when they ask for it.
01:20:40.96 --> 01:20:47.96 So you have to flank people that's what you have to do now he's asking specifically how do you do this so here's some things.
01:20:47.96 --> 01:21:01.96 What one of the things that I do when I want to give someone a criticism I don't give them criticism what I do is I ask them questions about whatever it is now he this is interesting I'm not even talking about pointed questions I'm not even talking about like hard questions.
01:21:01.96 --> 01:21:07.96 I'm not saying like why did you do that no I'm talking about hey why did you do it that way.
01:21:07.96 --> 01:21:14.96 Like there's a big difference between like why did you do it that way me like in said saying hey echo that frame is doesn't look good.
01:21:14.96 --> 01:21:20.96 Hey why did you frame that up like that right so now I'm getting you to think about it right but I'm not going to say.
01:21:20.96 --> 01:21:23.96 Do how are you going to make that work.
01:21:23.96 --> 01:21:28.96 You know I'm going to say well hey do you think you're going to be able to make that work.
01:21:28.96 --> 01:21:36.96 If if you did something and it doesn't go well I'm not going to say you know did you actually think that was a good idea.
01:21:36.96 --> 01:21:41.96 Instead I'm going to say it's again it's not pointing question I'm going to say.
01:21:41.96 --> 01:21:45.96 Well did hey did that unfold the way you thought it was going to unfold.
01:21:45.96 --> 01:21:53.96 And now you're going to get to answer the question now you're going to be you're going to be the person that uncovers the fault.
01:21:53.96 --> 01:22:01.96 It's going to be you not me and that makes it so much more palatable to everyone when they're able to say oh yeah you know I saw this over here.
01:22:01.96 --> 01:22:04.96 And most of the time the person knows the truth.
01:22:04.96 --> 01:22:11.96 Most of the time the person knows that that thing stopped framed up right they know that the idea was not great so you don't need to punch him in the face with it because that's actually going to make him get defensive.
01:22:11.96 --> 01:22:18.96 So you're playing come you ask him the question you talk about it you discuss the subject and what you do is you guide him.
01:22:18.96 --> 01:22:24.96 You guide him to a mirror you guide him to a mirror and then and then you just have looking at that mirror.
01:22:24.96 --> 01:22:33.96 You set him up so they have to look at that mirror so that they can see the problems themselves and once they see the problems themselves they can start to correct them.
01:22:33.96 --> 01:22:38.96 Now sometimes you sometimes it's your ego.
01:22:38.96 --> 01:22:45.96 That wants even once they see the problem themselves the people want to take credit for showing that and it's you got to check your ego.
01:22:45.96 --> 01:22:52.96 You got to make sure that your ego is insane I want to prove to this person that I know how to frame this up better then you got to put that all in check.
01:22:52.96 --> 01:22:58.96 You got to just let you got to let him have it.
01:22:58.96 --> 01:23:04.96 So now are there situations where you can give really good frank feedback yes there is.
01:23:04.96 --> 01:23:09.96 But you have to have a good relationship with that person or really good relationship with that person.
01:23:09.96 --> 01:23:23.96 And then usually one of the best ways to make this happen is that the feedback the negative feedback is going both ways meaning I want to get negative feedback about my performance from that person so that there's some.
01:23:23.96 --> 01:23:28.96 Equanimity and what's being said among us right.
01:23:28.96 --> 01:23:31.96 So I might be a little you know I might say echo.
01:23:31.96 --> 01:23:44.96 Hey man I did I you know I did this I answer this question on Q and I did you think I was a good answer because I think you know I think could have been better and then you say yeah you know you dragged on you talk too long and whatever you give me some critique and then I go oh yeah.
01:23:44.96 --> 01:23:52.96 Hey and by the way the lighting on that didn't look good right and so now we have a little mutual criticism and it's all good makes a little bit more palatable to you because I made the thing.
01:23:52.96 --> 01:24:02.96 And so that's sometimes works but what's interesting is even when you do that some people just don't even freaking care and and they even after they just tear you apart.
01:24:02.96 --> 01:24:12.96 And then you throw a little little like a little nick on their shoulder on their arm you give them a little nick about something that wasn't right they still get.
01:24:12.96 --> 01:24:32.96 So you have to be really. You have to have a really great relationship with that person to be able to have just that straight straight feedback but build relationships ask them questions let them find their own faults if you can and be their guide let them to provide them to that mirror got into their faults.
01:24:32.96 --> 01:24:47.96 Now of course there are some people that won't even find their own faults no matter how you guide them and how hard you trying to assume to look in the mirror you have to let them know.
01:24:47.96 --> 01:24:53.96 You actually have to come out and say what's going on you have to be more direct now luckily.
01:24:53.96 --> 01:25:03.96 If a person is the type person that fails to see their own faults they begin to fail right because they're making mistakes that's why they're faults right they're making mistakes and when they see that.
01:25:03.96 --> 01:25:12.96 When you see that and you see that their project is failing or you see that their people are revolting against them or you see that they're missing deadline after deadline they know that too.
01:25:12.96 --> 01:25:30.96 And then what you're doing is you're coming to them basically as like a concerned friend that really wants to help them win and and pointing out some of these obvious failures that they might not be you know aware of and you still got to be gentle about this.
01:25:30.96 --> 01:25:42.96 But when you come to them you can come to them as a friend as a as a person that really wants them to win and you can come out out there looking like the good guy trying to help them get their.
01:25:42.96 --> 01:25:46.96 Theirself back on track.
01:25:46.96 --> 01:25:49.96 So those are some of the.
01:25:49.96 --> 01:25:54.96 Some of the basic strategies that I used to help people to the little course correction.
01:25:54.96 --> 01:26:04.96 People need a little criticism so that they can not improve their game for themselves for the team etc.
01:26:04.96 --> 01:26:06.96 Good.
01:26:06.96 --> 01:26:07.96 So business man.
01:26:07.96 --> 01:26:10.96 My input people are people aren't people aren't people aren't people aren't like criticism.
01:26:10.96 --> 01:26:14.96 Yeah, yeah, they like praise.
01:26:14.96 --> 01:26:16.96 You know how.
01:26:16.96 --> 01:26:19.96 And you know the other side of this coin.
01:26:19.96 --> 01:26:25.96 If you're a person which you are and you don't like.
01:26:25.96 --> 01:26:27.96 And you don't.
01:26:27.96 --> 01:26:29.96 If you can open your mind to the criticism man you're going to be so you're going to get so much better about everything that you do.
01:26:29.96 --> 01:26:33.96 If you can just listen to people without getting ego crazy and thinking.
01:26:33.96 --> 01:26:36.96 You know about this.
01:26:36.96 --> 01:26:37.96 Yep.
01:26:37.96 --> 01:26:39.96 Just listen to just listen not your head.
01:26:39.96 --> 01:26:42.96 Let's know what they have to say they're trying to help you.
01:26:42.96 --> 01:26:43.96 Right.
01:26:43.96 --> 01:26:45.96 We assume that they're trying to help us.
01:26:45.96 --> 01:26:46.96 Yeah.
01:26:46.96 --> 01:26:47.96 Well, no.
01:26:47.96 --> 01:26:48.96 Yeah.
01:26:48.96 --> 01:26:49.96 Absolutely.
01:26:49.96 --> 01:26:49.96 Yeah.
01:26:49.96 --> 01:26:53.96 But if you go in with the assumption that this person just trying to cut me down well then that's not going to get you anywhere.
01:26:53.96 --> 01:26:54.96 Yeah.
01:26:54.96 --> 01:26:56.96 But if you make this something you know what I'm going to listen to what this person has to say.
01:26:56.96 --> 01:26:57.96 What's wrong with that?
01:26:57.96 --> 01:26:58.96 Yeah.
01:26:58.96 --> 01:26:59.96 Even if it's an assumption we're not supposed to assume.
01:26:59.96 --> 01:27:03.96 If I assume you're going to want I'm going to assume that Eko is giving me criticism right now because he wants me to do better.
01:27:03.96 --> 01:27:08.96 And I'm going to take them as as face value as I can.
01:27:08.96 --> 01:27:09.96 Yeah.
01:27:09.96 --> 01:27:11.96 That he is trying to help me get better.
01:27:11.96 --> 01:27:12.96 Yeah.
01:27:12.96 --> 01:27:13.96 And yeah.
01:27:13.96 --> 01:27:16.96 That's actually really correct.
01:27:16.96 --> 01:27:31.96 If you start at that point that's your default right that hey this criticism is to help now I might look at your criticism and I analyze it from a detached perspective and I go I think actually Eko is just trying to drag me in the wrong direction because he's jealous and I might get to that point.
01:27:31.96 --> 01:27:32.96 Yeah.
01:27:32.96 --> 01:27:33.96 And it'll be more way more obvious.
01:27:33.96 --> 01:27:34.96 And it'll be way more obvious.
01:27:34.96 --> 01:27:37.96 If you if you started that that that other one where it's okay to say.
01:27:37.96 --> 01:27:43.96 But if you're just default all he just wants to try to look like he knows everything or he just wants to you know make if you start there.
01:27:43.96 --> 01:27:47.96 Yeah.
01:27:47.96 --> 01:27:48.96 Yeah.
01:27:48.96 --> 01:27:51.96 Yeah.
01:27:51.96 --> 01:27:53.96 You can't even kind of discern you know if that really is happening or not.
01:27:53.96 --> 01:27:54.96 Not the place to be.
01:27:54.96 --> 01:27:57.96 Next wish.
01:27:57.96 --> 01:27:58.96 Choco.
01:27:58.96 --> 01:27:59.96 What's the best way to combine striking and grappling with self defense in mind?
01:27:59.96 --> 01:28:03.96 Never heard you mention MMA in this context only due to it gloves on.
01:28:03.96 --> 01:28:09.96 Consequently how the teams adapt MMA based training to real situations.
01:28:09.96 --> 01:28:12.96 What's your take on army's modern army combat is?
01:28:12.96 --> 01:28:13.96 Okay.
01:28:13.96 --> 01:28:14.96 So a few questions there.
01:28:14.96 --> 01:28:18.96 How do you best learn to combine striking and grappling?
01:28:18.96 --> 01:28:20.96 Well, what you do is you combine striking and grappling.
01:28:20.96 --> 01:28:21.96 That's how you get going.
01:28:21.96 --> 01:28:23.96 You put on the big gloves.
01:28:23.96 --> 01:28:24.96 We used to call it shoot boxing.
01:28:24.96 --> 01:28:27.96 That was like a block of training that we doing with with guys that were fighting MMA.
01:28:27.96 --> 01:28:31.96 You put on the big the relatively big boxing gloves.
01:28:31.96 --> 01:28:34.96 And then you put you mix and take down to them.
01:28:34.96 --> 01:28:36.96 So that's great.
01:28:36.96 --> 01:28:37.96 You should do that.
01:28:37.96 --> 01:28:38.96 You can do that with kids too.
01:28:38.96 --> 01:28:41.96 You can do that with kids where you put the big boxing gloves on kids and you have a shoot.
01:28:41.96 --> 01:28:42.96 Those double legs all day long.
01:28:42.96 --> 01:28:45.96 So when somebody takes a swing out of them, they know how to set up.
01:28:45.96 --> 01:28:46.96 They know the timing.
01:28:46.96 --> 01:28:50.96 They start to get familiar with it because in a way, well, it take down.
01:28:50.96 --> 01:28:55.96 Are easier in MMA because the person is not solely defending against.
01:28:55.96 --> 01:28:57.96 A take down they're defending against punches.
01:28:57.96 --> 01:28:58.96 They're defending against kicks.
01:28:58.96 --> 01:29:02.96 So they have to be in a different stance.
01:29:02.96 --> 01:29:05.96 And so that's the way it works.
01:29:05.96 --> 01:29:08.96 If you want to train to get combined striking, grappling.
01:29:08.96 --> 01:29:11.96 You have to combine them together.
01:29:11.96 --> 01:29:17.96 And you know, if I've only mentioned it with, due to two clubs on man, I've done a ton of MMA,
01:29:17.96 --> 01:29:23.96 sparring with fighters like a ton with gloves, with big gloves, shoot boxing, little gloves, everything.
01:29:23.96 --> 01:29:28.96 And I don't know why I haven't talked about it much, but yeah, I've done a ton of it.
01:29:28.96 --> 01:29:33.96 And that's how I know like taking someone down with that's trying to punch you as easier.
01:29:33.96 --> 01:29:35.96 Now it sucks when you get punched.
01:29:35.96 --> 01:29:40.96 But it is easier than going against someone that's just trying to wrestle you and has a different stance.
01:29:40.96 --> 01:29:41.96 A lower stance than all that.
01:29:41.96 --> 01:29:43.96 So yeah, that's how you do it.
01:29:43.96 --> 01:29:45.96 You put your big gloves on.
01:29:45.96 --> 01:29:49.96 And then also you can do you can drill with big gloves on.
01:29:49.96 --> 01:29:55.96 Where someone's trying to punch you while they're in your guard or while you're punching while you're someone's trying to punch you while they're mounted.
01:29:55.96 --> 01:29:57.96 You can do that with slaps too, right?
01:29:57.96 --> 01:30:03.96 Like I mount you and I'm just starting slapping you because then you realize if these were punches, you'd be in serious trouble.
01:30:03.96 --> 01:30:07.96 So yeah, you can mix those things in and mix them together.
01:30:07.96 --> 01:30:08.96 Don't get hurt.
01:30:08.96 --> 01:30:09.96 Be careful.
01:30:09.96 --> 01:30:11.96 But yeah, you can definitely mix them.
01:30:11.96 --> 01:30:14.96 So now the next question was how do the teams adapt MMA based training?
01:30:14.96 --> 01:30:16.96 Well, the big concepts are the same.
01:30:16.96 --> 01:30:18.96 The big concepts are exactly the same.
01:30:18.96 --> 01:30:19.96 You're going to have to close the distance.
01:30:19.96 --> 01:30:22.96 Like you got someone that's on arm that you're going to need control of.
01:30:22.96 --> 01:30:23.96 Well, you got to close the distance.
01:30:23.96 --> 01:30:24.96 You got to take them down.
01:30:24.96 --> 01:30:25.96 You got to get control of them.
01:30:25.96 --> 01:30:27.96 You got to submit or subdue them somehow.
01:30:27.96 --> 01:30:28.96 That can happen.
01:30:28.96 --> 01:30:29.96 You got to be able to break away.
01:30:29.96 --> 01:30:30.96 If somebody grabs you.
01:30:30.96 --> 01:30:31.96 You got to be able to break away.
01:30:31.96 --> 01:30:33.96 You've got to be able to get up off the ground.
01:30:33.96 --> 01:30:35.96 There's some large muscle movements that are exactly the same.
01:30:35.96 --> 01:30:37.96 The striking parts are exactly the same.
01:30:37.96 --> 01:30:41.96 Someone's, you know, you want to clear someone or or you want to punch someone to get them,
01:30:41.96 --> 01:30:45.96 you know, a little bit disoriented before you get control.
01:30:45.96 --> 01:30:47.96 Yeah, that's that's what you're doing.
01:30:47.96 --> 01:30:50.96 That's what that's what boxing is, you know.
01:30:50.96 --> 01:30:52.96 And so those things aren't.
01:30:52.96 --> 01:30:58.96 There's so much of it that overlaps that the adaption doesn't have to be barely anything.
01:30:58.96 --> 01:31:03.96 The adaption comes in and we have to do some additional training, some additional concepts that you're moving with.
01:31:03.96 --> 01:31:08.96 You're on that you have to be able to protect your weapons and your weapon systems.
01:31:08.96 --> 01:31:13.96 So you, you know, you want to be aware of where your rifle is, where your pistol is, where your knife is.
01:31:13.96 --> 01:31:15.96 So that people can't get a hold of it.
01:31:15.96 --> 01:31:17.96 Weapons retention.
01:31:17.96 --> 01:31:19.96 So that becomes part of it.
01:31:19.96 --> 01:31:24.96 The the the fact that you're working with another person, usually a partner, a shooting buddy.
01:31:24.96 --> 01:31:26.96 That's going to cover and move for you.
01:31:26.96 --> 01:31:29.96 So if I go to take a guy down, I got to be aware of where my partner is.
01:31:29.96 --> 01:31:34.96 In case that person that I'm trying to take down gets the upper hand or has a weapon that I didn't see.
01:31:34.96 --> 01:31:36.96 So that my partner can get a clear shot.
01:31:36.96 --> 01:31:40.96 So there are tactical things that you do have to add in, but the fundamental concepts,
01:31:40.96 --> 01:31:43.96 there's there, there's so transferable.
01:31:43.96 --> 01:31:50.96 There's so transferable that it's it's it's like, you know, I, it's a gui and no gui, right?
01:31:50.96 --> 01:31:51.96 It's a gui and no gui.
01:31:51.96 --> 01:31:55.96 If someone is awesome at gui, they're going to be good at no gui.
01:31:55.96 --> 01:31:56.96 Yeah.
01:31:56.96 --> 01:31:58.96 And at will are there some concepts that you need to learn.
01:31:58.96 --> 01:31:59.96 Yeah, there's some little things.
01:31:59.96 --> 01:32:03.96 But there's an overlap is huge baseball and softball, right?
01:32:03.96 --> 01:32:09.96 The if someone played a college baseball and now they're playing on their local restaurant softball team.
01:32:09.96 --> 01:32:10.96 They're going to crush it, right?
01:32:10.96 --> 01:32:12.96 It's not the exact same sport.
01:32:12.96 --> 01:32:14.96 Longboard surfing versus shortboard surfing, right?
01:32:14.96 --> 01:32:18.96 If someone's a great surfer on a shortboard, they're going to be decent on a longboard.
01:32:18.96 --> 01:32:20.96 They might, they're not going to be in the world.
01:32:20.96 --> 01:32:24.96 They're going to be in the world.
01:32:24.96 --> 01:32:28.96 They're going to be in the world.
01:32:28.96 --> 01:32:30.96 They'll be damn good.
01:32:30.96 --> 01:32:33.96 One of the things that I used to, well,
01:32:33.96 --> 01:32:35.96 Okay, shooting, shooting.
01:32:35.96 --> 01:32:39.96 You got combat shooting, but then you just have competitive target shooting, right?
01:32:39.96 --> 01:32:41.96 It is competitive target shooting.
01:32:41.96 --> 01:32:43.96 The same as combat shooting.
01:32:43.96 --> 01:32:44.96 No, there's no explosions.
01:32:44.96 --> 01:32:48.96 There's no movement or oftentimes, no, there's there's competition where I do a movement too.
01:32:48.96 --> 01:32:53.96 And the more close it is, the better it's going to be, but if you're a competitive rifle shooter,
01:32:53.96 --> 01:32:57.96 and you, and then you do combat shooting, it is definitely,
01:32:57.96 --> 01:32:58.96 there's a ton of crossover.
01:32:58.96 --> 01:33:02.96 One of the things that I used to talk about a lot when people would question,
01:33:02.96 --> 01:33:05.96 Hey, well, MMA fighting, that's not good for the SEAL teams,
01:33:05.96 --> 01:33:06.96 because you don't have any gear on.
01:33:06.96 --> 01:33:11.96 One of the examples that I used a lot was guys that were really in-depair shooting.
01:33:11.96 --> 01:33:15.96 And, you know, when you, when you jump in the civilian world,
01:33:15.96 --> 01:33:17.96 you don't have a rock sack, you don't have a weapon,
01:33:17.96 --> 01:33:20.96 you don't have night vision goggles, you don't have any that stuff.
01:33:20.96 --> 01:33:26.96 And yet, if you have a thousand jumps as a civilian with a slick rig on,
01:33:26.96 --> 01:33:32.96 you're going to be infinitely better at the military skydive with the weapon
01:33:32.96 --> 01:33:36.96 and the rock sack and the night vision and all that, you're going to be infinitely better.
01:33:36.96 --> 01:33:38.96 It's the same exact thing.
01:33:38.96 --> 01:33:40.96 Are there some little things that you're going to have to figure out?
01:33:40.96 --> 01:33:44.96 Some details, where that, where they don't completely overlap, yes, absolutely.
01:33:44.96 --> 01:33:48.96 So, there you go. So, I guess when you train,
01:33:48.96 --> 01:33:50.96 JJ2, wrestling boxing, moi tie,
01:33:50.96 --> 01:33:56.96 if you're in the military, you know, you also have to make sure that you carve out time
01:33:56.96 --> 01:33:58.96 where you think about the other components, right?
01:33:58.96 --> 01:34:02.96 About having gear on, what that, what changes when you have your gear on,
01:34:02.96 --> 01:34:04.96 how to protect your weapons, all that stuff that I talked about,
01:34:04.96 --> 01:34:07.96 about working with other people, about the tactical situations that you're in,
01:34:07.96 --> 01:34:09.96 because there's going to be some tactical situations that you're in,
01:34:09.96 --> 01:34:12.96 if you're not thinking straight, you're going to have a problem.
01:34:12.96 --> 01:34:15.96 Never, never had somebody that goes, what did you do to smoke good for self-defense?
01:34:15.96 --> 01:34:17.96 What do you do? Pull guard in the street?
01:34:17.96 --> 01:34:20.96 It's like, no, you're never going to pull guard in the street.
01:34:20.96 --> 01:34:21.96 Or you shouldn't.
01:34:21.96 --> 01:34:24.96 As if pulling guard is like the only thing you did to that stuff.
01:34:24.96 --> 01:34:28.96 But here's the, well, the fact is, if someone takes you down in the street
01:34:28.96 --> 01:34:30.96 and you don't know the guard, what are you going to do?
01:34:30.96 --> 01:34:32.96 You're going to get your face smashed.
01:34:32.96 --> 01:34:35.96 So, you got to cover both angles,
01:34:35.96 --> 01:34:39.96 but there's so much overlap that if you get good and apt,
01:34:39.96 --> 01:34:42.96 you're going to have some of the fundamental of MMA,
01:34:42.96 --> 01:34:47.96 you will be really good at the, what you need to know with the additional concepts
01:34:47.96 --> 01:34:50.96 on military tactical types, types of situations.
01:34:50.96 --> 01:34:52.96 As far as modern army combatants,
01:34:52.96 --> 01:34:57.96 it's a great solid foundational program and created by some great,
01:34:57.96 --> 01:35:02.96 great martial artists that were in ground floor.
01:35:02.96 --> 01:35:06.96 I think Matt Larson did the guy that kind of is the grandfather of a father of,
01:35:06.96 --> 01:35:11.96 I don't know if his old enough to be great and father of MMA,
01:35:11.96 --> 01:35:13.96 it would be my age, so I don't know.
01:35:13.96 --> 01:35:14.96 Sorry, Matt.
01:35:14.96 --> 01:35:19.96 But yeah, I mean, he put together great system and it's a great fundamental system.
01:35:19.96 --> 01:35:22.96 It could someone pick apart some aspect of the army computer.
01:35:22.96 --> 01:35:24.96 You could, look at the whole system.
01:35:24.96 --> 01:35:25.96 It's a great solid system.
01:35:25.96 --> 01:35:27.96 Get people started out on.
01:35:27.96 --> 01:35:28.96 So props.
01:35:28.96 --> 01:35:31.96 I mean, any system you can kind of say that for.
01:35:31.96 --> 01:35:32.96 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:35:32.96 --> 01:35:33.96 You can't, you can't.
01:35:33.96 --> 01:35:36.96 You know, you know, there's a traditional system, right?
01:35:36.96 --> 01:35:37.96 Because it's a great foundational system.
01:35:37.96 --> 01:35:39.96 Because once you learn it, you don't, you don't learn the army combat,
01:35:39.96 --> 01:35:40.96 the modern army combatters.
01:35:40.96 --> 01:35:41.96 And then say, okay, we're good now.
01:35:41.96 --> 01:35:42.96 Don't need to train anymore.
01:35:42.96 --> 01:35:43.96 That's not the right answer.
01:35:43.96 --> 01:35:45.96 Right answer is you have a good foundation.
01:35:45.96 --> 01:35:46.96 Now keep building on it.
01:35:46.96 --> 01:35:47.96 Yeah.
01:35:47.96 --> 01:35:48.96 That's the answer.
01:35:48.96 --> 01:35:50.96 Yeah.
01:35:50.96 --> 01:35:55.96 You have to remember you to train for MMA and pancreasian.
01:35:55.96 --> 01:35:56.96 Remember that.
01:35:56.96 --> 01:35:57.96 Yeah.
01:35:57.96 --> 01:36:02.96 And it's trained for a while and the sparring element of it.
01:36:02.96 --> 01:36:06.40 three-fig, because there's, you know, even if you're training MMA, you're going to train
01:36:06.40 --> 01:36:11.44 striking one day and maybe even specialized striking stuff one day and then wrestling and
01:36:11.44 --> 01:36:16.72 grappling and you're just doing one day. But you have MMA sparring, which is a full MMA fight
01:36:16.72 --> 01:36:20.80 with big gloves and you know, may or may not have shimp as or whatever, but it's essentially
01:36:20.80 --> 01:36:26.32 MMA fight and that is 100% incorporating grappling and striking and take that's everything,
01:36:26.32 --> 01:36:31.36 you know? So it's kind of like one of those things where you get to train to fill in those gaps
01:36:31.36 --> 01:36:35.52 between, okay, one moment I'm striking one moment I'm grappling and the strikes while you're
01:36:35.52 --> 01:36:40.24 grappling, you know? And there's, and there's some, there's some inconsistencies because if you're
01:36:40.24 --> 01:36:45.04 striking with big gloves then you can't grab someone's hands the way you would with the little
01:36:45.04 --> 01:36:50.56 gloves on. But you like you said what it does is it fills in the gaps. Yeah. So yeah, that's what
01:36:50.56 --> 01:36:55.76 the training that's training is for. So like, you know, if you're, you know, if you like to play guard
01:36:55.76 --> 01:37:00.24 or you have a slick game from guard or whatever, if you train like an MMA training or training with
01:37:00.24 --> 01:37:05.68 strikes and stuff like that, it'll really expose where you're in danger in a real fight because
01:37:05.68 --> 01:37:11.04 that guy's gonna, you know, like it's gonna punch you in the face done there. So it's a faster
01:37:11.04 --> 01:37:15.20 pace thing. So it just builds your awareness of it. So I remember that even when I just go back
01:37:15.20 --> 01:37:18.96 to regular duty to do it, so whatever it's like, man, I feel super aware of it. Like almost
01:37:18.96 --> 01:37:22.08 like you're into this way. Okay, I can get punch from you. I actually think about that all the time.
01:37:22.08 --> 01:37:26.88 Yeah. I always think like I'll be wrong with Taylor. Yeah. And because Taylor is in like,
01:37:26.88 --> 01:37:31.60 Andy, I don't think about it as much because Andy's more of a duty to fighter, but, you know,
01:37:31.60 --> 01:37:38.24 Taylor, he's an MMA fighter. And so if he's on top of me for around, like he's in my top half guard.
01:37:38.24 --> 01:37:41.12 Yeah. And when we get down, I'll be like, I'm glad that wasn't MMA because you would have
01:37:41.12 --> 01:37:46.48 pulverized my head. Yeah. You know, and now do some gaps open up when people start punching.
01:37:46.48 --> 01:37:51.84 Yeah, they do. Is there an opportunity? Yeah, there is. But you're gonna take some shots.
01:37:51.84 --> 01:37:56.72 Yeah. Well, and then at the end of the day, all that is part of it. You know, so it's like,
01:37:56.72 --> 01:38:00.88 if you're, if you're okay, so here's the scenario I'd find myself in where the guy I'm going to
01:38:00.88 --> 01:38:06.000 get, this is a way better strike. Really me. Like way more experience and just better. But my
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:10.88 Jits is way better. So it's like, Tanger, I gotta get this guy to the ground. So if we don't,
01:38:10.88 --> 01:38:16.48 when we train this, I get that practice to be okay. I'm gonna use this guy's striking to like get
01:38:16.48 --> 01:38:19.84 around them or something like that. I'm not gonna like stand here and try to strike with him.
01:38:19.84 --> 01:38:23.68 Yeah. Be it up this training system. But you do have to stand there long enough to get them to
01:38:23.68 --> 01:38:27.84 think to get them to forget about you taking them down. Yeah. Fully. That's what I always, and you
01:38:27.84 --> 01:38:31.76 see that in MMA fights, too. Right. You can't just go in there and start shooting on the guy because
01:38:31.76 --> 01:38:34.72 they know that you're gonna try and take them down. Because they know their ground game is worse.
01:38:34.72 --> 01:38:38.000 And so they're gonna defend that take down exactly right. And then you get them thinking about
01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.60 you gotta get them thinking about that knockout. Right. And knock you out. And that's how that takes two
01:38:41.60 --> 01:38:45.04 minutes. Sometimes it takes three minutes. Sometimes it takes around and a half before you take your
01:38:45.04 --> 01:38:50.80 first shot. Yeah. And really to be real with you, it's that's what this training is for. So in the
01:38:50.80 --> 01:38:54.32 beginning, you might not even be able to take that guy down because you're like, oh, I know this guy.
01:38:54.32 --> 01:38:58.08 He's that judicious guy. Now he's kind of training with us. He was drinking me down and he's just
01:38:58.08 --> 01:39:01.76 gonna beat you up from the outside. And actually, yeah, what he'll do is he won't even beat you up.
01:39:01.76 --> 01:39:07.04 He won't even commit to his punches because he doesn't want to overstep and give you any advantage
01:39:07.04 --> 01:39:10.48 on your take down. Yeah. So he was standing like he said, Sandley, I thought you're attacking you
01:39:10.48 --> 01:39:15.20 in the attack. And I say that because that's kind of what happened to me. So I'd go in and then of course
01:39:15.20 --> 01:39:18.56 they just stay away or sprawl because they know it's coming kind of thing. And then you know as you
01:39:18.56 --> 01:39:23.76 reset from the straw, sprawl he but one, two cut on the on the separation. I don't think it's
01:39:23.76 --> 01:39:28.96 stuff. Yeah, no big deal. One, two, yeah. Just all around. Yeah. I've got to say it down. I'm saying
01:39:28.96 --> 01:39:32.80 it's funny because when you say you know you take a one, two is you're getting away, but
01:39:32.80 --> 01:39:38.80 though that punch is big boy. They stay boy. But after a while, that's what I'm saying. You get that
01:39:38.80 --> 01:39:43.20 training. Just through the training. You're like, okay, I know how this is now. It's not like
01:39:43.20 --> 01:39:47.20 digital, where I can kind of, you know, just go and lock up and if I don't get to take out a whole
01:39:47.20 --> 01:39:51.28 guard kind of thing, these guys, they're not trying to grapple with you. They're trying to stand
01:39:51.28 --> 01:39:55.36 back up. You get that training, you know. So when you wind up, you know, being able to take them
01:39:55.36 --> 01:39:59.92 down all this stuff, you can like you'll have just way more advantage because you're aware of
01:39:59.92 --> 01:40:04.24 all these different elements that you might not get in just digital class. You might get them,
01:40:04.24 --> 01:40:08.40 but you probably probably don't. You get a guy who always wants to stand up. Right, and you just
01:40:08.40 --> 01:40:13.28 a class. Try to roll with a guy in digital. Just trade you just who only wants to stand up.
01:40:13.28 --> 01:40:18.000 Who just would rather die than be in the bottom? He'll start. It's so annoying. It's challenging.
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:21.68 Something you need to learn to contend with because there are tactics that you can use as the
01:40:21.68 --> 01:40:25.04 guy on top to keep them down there. Exactly. Right. And you get them. I mean,
01:40:25.04 --> 01:40:30.24 me guys, especially if you're better than them at like the digital element of it, that's what
01:40:30.24 --> 01:40:33.84 they're going to do. So that's what training you're going to get. Yeah, check.
01:40:33.84 --> 01:40:43.04 Oh, next question. Draco, as a leader of a team or business has decided to,
01:40:43.92 --> 01:40:50.08 okay, as a leader of a team, our business has decided to terminate one of my people. I disagree with
01:40:50.08 --> 01:40:55.20 their logic, but I'm not in a position to change the decision. What should I do to retain my influence
01:40:55.20 --> 01:41:01.52 to support the rest of my team, yet not compromise my values? That's a good question. That's a solid
01:41:01.52 --> 01:41:06.88 question. That's a tough question. It's a little bit tricky without the details of the situation,
01:41:06.88 --> 01:41:13.92 but I wonder what kind of relationship that the person that asked the question, I wonder what kind of
01:41:13.92 --> 01:41:17.68 relationship you have with the senior leadership that makes those decisions, because you got to
01:41:17.68 --> 01:41:22.08 remember that our goal is to always have the relationships of the chain of commands, so that you can
01:41:22.08 --> 01:41:26.80 influence those decisions. And if you have that kind of relationship, then you can find out why that
01:41:26.80 --> 01:41:34.40 decision got made. And there might be things that you didn't know about. Some kind of strategic outcome
01:41:34.40 --> 01:41:40.72 that the decision has had an impact on, right? So if you didn't know it, but this guy had some kind
01:41:40.72 --> 01:41:45.36 of criminal situation going on and you didn't know it, then they can't talk about it, because it's
01:41:45.36 --> 01:41:51.36 illegal, okay? If you don't know, don't speculate, just go and ask. And then you can take whatever
01:41:51.36 --> 01:41:57.52 those reasons are, and you can articulate them down the chain of command. And again, you want to
01:41:57.52 --> 01:42:02.08 ask this question in a smart way. You know what I say? What a bill get fired. Hey, why do bill get fired?
01:42:02.08 --> 01:42:06.72 Now you say, hey, from my perspective, it seemed like bill was doing a good job. I want to kind of
01:42:06.72 --> 01:42:10.96 understand what you were seeing, so that I can lead people better. If there's anything that I can
01:42:10.96 --> 01:42:15.12 make up for, I want to make sure I'm leading people. Like all those things, you want to help their
01:42:15.12 --> 01:42:18.96 ego and make them feel good to make them feel like you're on board of the program and not make
01:42:18.96 --> 01:42:22.56 them feel like you're going there questioning their call, because that's just an attack on their ego.
01:42:22.56 --> 01:42:27.20 So this is all these things. It's a basic things, right? The fun of Ash, he called it basic. These
01:42:27.20 --> 01:42:32.48 are the fundamental things, right? This is the, this is the way it is standard. I should just say standard.
01:42:32.48 --> 01:42:36.80 That's what I should say. Standard stuff. You're trying to build a relationship. You don't want
01:42:36.80 --> 01:42:40.80 to go in, but your head up against their ego, then they get more defensive. And next, you know,
01:42:40.80 --> 01:42:45.12 they're going to fire another one of your guys on your team, just to prove a point, you can get
01:42:45.12 --> 01:42:48.72 yourself. You can dig yourself that whole. But if you make your goal, hey, I'm going to build
01:42:48.72 --> 01:42:56.40 the relationship with my boss. That's what you are trying to do. Now, if you find out why then you
01:42:56.40 --> 01:43:03.44 can articulate that to the rest of the team and the way that you maintain your values is by maintaining
01:43:03.44 --> 01:43:08.40 your values. Okay? So just because there's a situation that our decision that gets made that you
01:43:08.40 --> 01:43:13.92 don't agree with doesn't mean that you compromised your values. Like your boss can make a decision
01:43:13.92 --> 01:43:17.68 and that doesn't, that you don't agree with. That doesn't mean that your values are compromised
01:43:17.68 --> 01:43:23.76 unless it's like an illegal or it's an immoral or it's an unethical situation, which by the way,
01:43:23.76 --> 01:43:30.000 a firing could be one of those things. Right? The guy could be firing because he wasn't, you know,
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.12 what wouldn't he wouldn't give me the keys to the vehicle for the weekend. So I could use it on my
01:43:35.12 --> 01:43:40.56 private time and I'm going to fire him now. Like that's unethical, right? There's a problem. So now
01:43:40.56 --> 01:43:46.72 your values definitely, if you just remain silently, you're kind of compromising your values.
01:43:46.72 --> 01:43:50.80 So there are times when you may have to stand up, but bosses make decisions. That's what they do.
01:43:50.80 --> 01:43:56.16 And we do our best to influence them. Now, if they decide something we don't like then yes,
01:43:56.16 --> 01:44:02.32 we ask why and if we don't like their explanation then we try and explain our case. We try and explain
01:44:02.32 --> 01:44:08.32 why we thought Bill should have been not been fired. Now you're not always going to be right.
01:44:09.44 --> 01:44:13.52 You're not always going to be right. And let me tell you something else. Don't argue about
01:44:13.52 --> 01:44:17.36 six and one half does and the other. Bill might have been on the fence and they decided you know what,
01:44:17.36 --> 01:44:20.96 we found enough trouble with Bill. We're getting rid of them. And maybe there's valid reasons
01:44:20.96 --> 01:44:24.96 where I Bill should have said, but it's like it could have gone at 6040. Are you going to put your
01:44:24.96 --> 01:44:29.20 reputation and your relationship with your boss on the line for over that little thing?
01:44:30.40 --> 01:44:34.64 Now again, I understand firing people is a big deal. It's not small. It's not a little thing.
01:44:35.20 --> 01:44:39.36 Especially you have a good relationship. He's on your team. He's got kids. You know, I look all these
01:44:39.36 --> 01:44:45.28 things are there. So what are you going to do about it? Are you going to break down and
01:44:46.80 --> 01:44:51.44 negatively impact your relationship with your boss over this? So that in the future you have even less
01:44:51.44 --> 01:44:56.000 influence what happens when they go to fire Mike? And you haven't and all you did was go,
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.56 hey, why'd you do this? It's a stupid. They're going to fire Mike and they're not going to listen to
01:44:58.56 --> 01:45:07.84 damn thing you said. You want to build a relationship with them. You can you can explain what your
01:45:07.84 --> 01:45:12.48 view point is and what you would have done now. This is like down. This is talking to your team.
01:45:12.48 --> 01:45:18.16 You can explain what your view point was and what you would have done. But you also, you don't want
01:45:18.16 --> 01:45:22.48 to, you don't want to be gentle, right? As long as you explain, if you explain the, hey, I would have
01:45:22.48 --> 01:45:26.24 done something different and you also explained that the boss, it was a tough decision and the boss
01:45:26.24 --> 01:45:30.56 made the call and the best thing that we can do as a team is support the boss so we can
01:45:30.56 --> 01:45:38.48 garner more influence over these situations in the future. That's good. And you know what,
01:45:38.48 --> 01:45:42.88 one of the best things you could do here with your team is you can even explain that it's your
01:45:42.88 --> 01:45:48.56 fault that the decision got made. Right? You say, look, I haven't built a good enough relationship
01:45:48.56 --> 01:45:53.76 with the boss. That's why you fired Bill. I'm working on it. I'm going to do it better. We're
01:45:53.76 --> 01:45:58.24 going to give him the support that he needs so we can stop this thing from happening in the future.
01:45:58.24 --> 01:46:03.68 So you don't want to throw your boss under the bus. It's much, much better to take ownership of it.
01:46:03.68 --> 01:46:08.72 All day, all day. If you throw your boss under the bus and you create an antagonistic relationship,
01:46:08.72 --> 01:46:12.56 it's bad for you, it's bad for your boss and it's bad for your team and it's bad for your whole
01:46:12.56 --> 01:46:22.000 organization. I get it. And there's a dichotomy here because if your boss totally
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.04 fired someone with not good reason and it was a great guy and if you just jump on board of the
01:46:27.04 --> 01:46:33.12 boss, you're going to look weak. So do you have to balance that? Yes, you have to be honest with
01:46:33.12 --> 01:46:36.16 your people. We have to explain what's going on. That's why I think taking ownership is one of the
01:46:36.16 --> 01:46:40.56 best things to do. Your boss does something that's totally out of line. Hey, look, here's what the
01:46:40.56 --> 01:46:43.76 boss did. This is my fault. Here's what I'm doing to fix. I'm going to build a better relationship.
01:46:43.76 --> 01:46:46.80 I'm going to get more influence. That's what I need to do. I obviously let you guys down. I'm not
01:46:46.80 --> 01:46:55.12 going to let it happen again. That brings your team closer to you rather than saying, hey, the boss
01:46:55.12 --> 01:46:59.76 was boss and idiot. He doesn't get it. You're going to be a people don't actually even respect that.
01:46:59.76 --> 01:47:05.52 By the way, they don't actually even respect that. I'm not saying they say, hey, the to boss
01:47:05.52 --> 01:47:09.92 is decision and that's, you know what, we just support the boss. I'm not saying that. It's a dichotomy.
01:47:09.92 --> 01:47:19.28 It's a balance that you have to carefully walk. Compromise, compromise on decisions and directions
01:47:19.28 --> 01:47:26.40 and plans doesn't hurt. You know, he's talking about compromising. It's like, compromise is okay.
01:47:26.40 --> 01:47:30.000 That's what it is. Compromise is okay. Again, as long as you're not compromising,
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:36.40 your personal values, your ethics. But compromising about a decision, that's the way the world works.
01:47:36.40 --> 01:47:43.36 Don't let your ego get into it. Don't let your ego. So keep building relationships, take ownership
01:47:43.36 --> 01:47:48.32 of the decisions and support the team. Keep building relationships, not just the chain of command,
01:47:48.32 --> 01:47:57.04 but down so that you can bring it all together. Next question. Go. Question frogman.
01:47:59.44 --> 01:48:06.48 Do you think it's always a bad thing to be thought of as slightly unapproachable as a leader?
01:48:07.28 --> 01:48:11.20 Yeah, so this is another question about the dichotomy of leadership. It's another question about
01:48:11.20 --> 01:48:14.48 balance and it's strangely worded question by the way from this, this, this, this,
01:48:14.48 --> 01:48:24.08 scots me, who I know. It's because he uses the question, he uses the word always and usually always
01:48:24.08 --> 01:48:30.08 is always a never right when you use those. They usually don't hold up. It's an always and bad thing.
01:48:30.80 --> 01:48:37.20 But then he kind of, he kind of softens the always by saying slightly unapproachable. So
01:48:37.20 --> 01:48:47.44 we give him a fairly low grade on his question. But luckily the concept of the question we
01:48:47.44 --> 01:48:55.36 give him a high grade, which is, is it, is it, should you be unapproachable? Slightly unapproachable.
01:48:55.36 --> 01:48:59.76 Should you be, that's the real question. Should you be slightly unapproachable as a leader? Well,
01:48:59.76 --> 01:49:05.76 there's, this is a question about dichotomy. The question is about balance. Do you want to
01:49:05.76 --> 01:49:09.28 have people approach you about every little problem ratio as a boss? Do you want to have that happen?
01:49:10.64 --> 01:49:15.68 No, you don't. Right? Do you want to be the easy button where you have to answer every single
01:49:15.68 --> 01:49:19.52 question to make every decision? No. If you're too approachable, that's where you're going to find
01:49:19.52 --> 01:49:25.04 yourself. Now, at the same time, at the other end of the spectrum, do you want your team to never approach
01:49:25.04 --> 01:49:32.48 you ever? Because you're unapproachable. No, you don't want that. Do you want them to, to be scared or
01:49:32.48 --> 01:49:38.08 intimidated from giving you good honest feedback or good suggestions about the way you're doing things?
01:49:38.08 --> 01:49:42.48 Do you, do you not want that to happen? Because you're too unapproachable? Of course not.
01:49:43.60 --> 01:49:49.36 So those are the dichotomies. You can be too approachable and be the easy button or you can be too
01:49:49.36 --> 01:49:52.88 aloof and too distant and too unapproachable. That you don't even know what's happening on the front
01:49:52.88 --> 01:49:57.68 lines and you don't get any input from them. The extremes are bad. So what you want to do is you want
01:49:57.68 --> 01:50:03.92 to bounce those two dichotomies be in the middle. Be approachable, but not overly approachable.
01:50:05.20 --> 01:50:11.76 And you'll be good. Pretty straightforward. I think we got time for one more.
01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.92 I'm talking. What do you do when you're broke in?
01:50:19.92 --> 01:50:38.64 What do I do when I'm broken? When I'm broken, I relish it. That's what I'm going to use it.
01:50:40.72 --> 01:50:45.76 Because if I'm broken, then I just found my limitations.
01:50:45.76 --> 01:50:56.80 And until I know what my limitations are, how can I push them? How can I get better?
01:50:59.44 --> 01:51:11.76 But once I see it, once I feel it, once I see where I was broken, then I can attack that weakness.
01:51:11.76 --> 01:51:18.56 I can fill in that gap. I can reinforce that breach.
01:51:23.20 --> 01:51:30.96 If you break, it means it's time to fortify your will to make it stronger.
01:51:30.96 --> 01:51:44.24 Then look, there's all kinds of different ways to break. You can break physically, you can break
01:51:44.24 --> 01:51:51.36 mentally, you can break your heart, you can break your spirit, and none of those are fun. And all of
01:51:51.36 --> 01:52:05.12 those are going to leave a mark. But the mark that they leave can be the mark of victory or
01:52:05.12 --> 01:52:14.000 be the mark of defeat. Because every time you break in it, in every way that you break,
01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:22.16 while it's a chance, it's definitely a chance for you to give up and for you to just follow apart.
01:52:26.72 --> 01:52:38.08 But there's also opportunity. There's opportunity to get stronger, get smarter, and get faster,
01:52:38.08 --> 01:52:47.92 and get tougher, and get more stable, and get more resilient, and get better.
01:52:52.96 --> 01:53:06.24 When you break, you have the opportunity to show the world, the whole world, what you are
01:53:06.24 --> 01:53:21.04 really made of. So, if you break, if you break, the fight isn't over.
01:53:21.04 --> 01:53:36.96 In fact, if you break, the fight is just beginning. And as you crawl up and out of that
01:53:36.96 --> 01:53:47.92 dismal and wretched place, covered, and you're covered in blood and sweat and dirt and filth, as you rise,
01:53:47.92 --> 01:53:58.16 above what you were. And as you take the form of of who you are supposed to be,
01:53:58.16 --> 01:54:09.68 you will see that in the very act of standing up and the very act of fighting on,
01:54:09.68 --> 01:54:18.08 you will become and you will remain unbroken.
01:54:18.08 --> 01:54:35.92 And I think that's all I've got for tonight's so echo Charles speaking of getting stronger,
01:54:35.92 --> 01:54:43.28 and faster, and tougher, and better. Maybe you got some ways we could, you know, support ourselves
01:54:43.28 --> 01:54:52.08 with those goals, facilitate getting better and stronger. I like it. Push the breaking point.
01:54:52.08 --> 01:54:56.24 I'll tell you that, that'll push your breaking point, especially the joint warfare part.
01:54:56.24 --> 01:55:02.96 No, you like that. Coming right in hot. No, that's okay. So, start with the origin,
01:55:02.96 --> 01:55:08.96 right? Origin. Merch and made. Yeah, we're at the origin immersion camp right now.
01:55:08.96 --> 01:55:14.96 We're sorry that you're not here. Oh, you're up to the main. Or we're happy that you are here.
01:55:14.96 --> 01:55:18.48 Or yeah, if you're here, we're happy you're here. Yeah, definitely. There's a lot of people in the game.
01:55:18.48 --> 01:55:23.20 There's a lot of people in the game. A lot of people heard us say on the podcast come to the origin camp,
01:55:23.20 --> 01:55:28.000 and they're here. And guess what? In the form. Yeah, in the form. It's awesome. Yeah, every level.
01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:32.88 How do black belts are here? Dang, I don't know. A lot. Yeah. How many white belts are here? A lot.
01:55:32.88 --> 01:55:38.96 Yeah. How many people have never trained you, Jitsu? A lot. A decent number. Okay, to put into context,
01:55:38.96 --> 01:55:43.76 this is, I think we had to do this, right? Or we just did. None of the last of the
01:55:43.76 --> 01:55:47.60 people we did. We're breaking up. Yeah. So, everyone convenes in the morning, right?
01:55:47.60 --> 01:55:54.48 For on the big mats, and they're like, hey, who hasn't had any experience at all, or, you know,
01:55:54.48 --> 01:56:00.24 under a however, among their mom or something like that? Go with Jockel guys over here to this other
01:56:00.24 --> 01:56:06.80 mat. Yeah. The other mat was full. It was full. Yeah. So it's late. The point is it's not just like
01:56:06.80 --> 01:56:12.56 people who want to just, you know, get after their Jitsu game, and they've been in it for years and years,
01:56:12.56 --> 01:56:17.20 and they want to camp out and do it. It's not that. Yeah. And it's only, there's a lot of
01:56:17.20 --> 01:56:22.64 different instructions. Like, like, yes, like yesterday, the Dakot and I taught the, taught the new
01:56:22.64 --> 01:56:29.20 Jitsu people. Yeah. Today, I think it was the Dakot and Hoffa and I stayed down with the, the
01:56:29.20 --> 01:56:35.12 colored belts. Right. I think there's, I think there's probably the same number of
01:56:35.68 --> 01:56:44.48 black belts here as people that their first day ever on the mats was here. Yeah. I think it's about
01:56:44.48 --> 01:56:49.76 the same number, what? Like, 20, 20 of each. 20 people that have never trained Jitsu before, and 20
01:56:49.76 --> 01:56:53.60 people that have their black belts in Jitsu. There's like those two. And then there's everyone in between.
01:56:53.60 --> 01:56:57.84 You, this guy, oh, I was talking to his guy. He's like, he goes, yeah, today's my second
01:56:57.84 --> 01:57:01.36 day. I was like, oh, yeah, right on where, where, you know, when was your first day? Where was he?
01:57:01.36 --> 01:57:05.20 He goes, oh, yeah, here. Yes. I was like, oh, I forgot. I keep one day after he is going to
01:57:05.20 --> 01:57:09.92 sit sweet crazy. But yeah. So we're, we're right now. Yep. We're, everyone to the factory.
01:57:09.92 --> 01:57:16.000 Yeah. The orange and factory. In farming to Maine saw where everything is made. Yeah.
01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:22.32 Big time. So what do we have? Guis. Roshka. There's a new, you guys were extra fired up about
01:57:22.32 --> 01:57:28.40 extra extra fired up. Oh, was that, is that a deal? I think it's definitely, well, we can't show
01:57:28.40 --> 01:57:35.68 anybody, but we do have a new key coming. Yeah. And we'll say it's, it's very awesome. Let's check.
01:57:35.68 --> 01:57:41.44 Yeah. Nonetheless, picking a geese origin, the best geese hands down. Everyone knows they're
01:57:41.44 --> 01:57:46.48 ready. It's like what he called this common knowledge. Anyway, Maine and America. 100% Maine and
01:57:46.48 --> 01:57:51.76 America. Also, Roshka's all kinds of Jitsu stuff. Those shorts, those new shorts they came out with.
01:57:51.76 --> 01:57:58.08 I proved big tent. Yeah. But yeah, they got some some sweat suits to joggers. Sure,
01:57:58.08 --> 01:58:05.92 some whatnot. Oh, good stuff. Supplements. Yeah. You know, the supplements. These are supplements that,
01:58:06.88 --> 01:58:11.28 how do I pick what supplements I'm going to make? It's supplements that I've taken. Yeah.
01:58:11.28 --> 01:58:20.56 And dial them in. The protein, the milk, taste good, is good. No sugar. What's it got? One
01:58:20.56 --> 01:58:27.60 carb, two carbs, something like that. Yeah. Something like that. Just a little tasty dessert.
01:58:27.60 --> 01:58:33.36 Just, but it was really way to eat. Yeah. You were talking about doing warfare. We got
01:58:33.36 --> 01:58:39.36 krill oil all good. We got discipline. You're pre. I saw a lot of people drinking discipline,
01:58:39.36 --> 01:58:43.04 like heading to the maps. A lot of people drinking that discipline. Yeah. And someone said it was
01:58:43.04 --> 01:58:47.28 in that big cooler and didn't go over there and check. That would make sense. Yeah. It's, it's,
01:58:47.28 --> 01:58:54.24 it's, so that's who we got that. That's origin main, origin main.com. You get all that. That's our company.
01:58:54.24 --> 01:59:00.24 We're making all this stuff. We're going to keep making stuff until until we make everything that we use.
01:59:00.24 --> 01:59:06.32 That's the goal. Yeah. Yeah. And these are especially the joint stuff, man. The joint stuff on
01:59:06.32 --> 01:59:12.16 is the one that is like it every day. Go to, in my case, that's milk too. Where I'm every day
01:59:12.16 --> 01:59:17.76 and pounding milk on the milk. Yeah. And you, you surprised me earlier because I asked you,
01:59:17.76 --> 01:59:21.52 because you always say you're on the milk train fully, or you say you're fully on the milk train,
01:59:21.52 --> 01:59:25.52 fully. Usually you say, yeah, usually you say you're on the milk train fully. Is it safe?
01:59:26.72 --> 01:59:31.52 And I asked you could someone be partially on the milk train. And you said that that was in
01:59:31.52 --> 01:59:37.60 fact possible. I don't know how that's possible. But well, you have to, how many milk, how many
01:59:37.60 --> 01:59:43.68 milk a day certifies you as being on the milk train? At least one a day. Okay, that's pretty,
01:59:43.68 --> 01:59:49.04 that's doable. That's not crazy. But if you're pounding milk every day, that's the
01:59:49.04 --> 01:59:53.92 milk train regardless. But when you're fully on the milk train, that's like a milk
01:59:53.92 --> 01:59:59.20 it is fully on the milk train. That's like two, sometimes three. Yeah. Yeah. Imagine so basically
01:59:59.20 --> 02:00:08.96 with two, two scoops or two, two situations. To me, two scoops is one one. That's one drink.
02:00:08.96 --> 02:00:12.56 Two scoops. See, that's the thing is I've got this new thing where I do these little hitters.
02:00:12.56 --> 02:00:15.36 Yeah. You're just like, I know, I know, there's the situation.
02:00:15.36 --> 02:00:18.08 Me and Theo Vaughan were hanging out when he's talking about hitters. But he isn't even
02:00:18.08 --> 02:00:22.000 know about Vaughan. I understand him some milk. So he can have a hitter. A hitter is Vaughan scoop.
02:00:22.56 --> 02:00:27.68 Vaughan scoop, it doesn't, that's a thing, is it doesn't make because when I have a double shot
02:00:27.68 --> 02:00:34.88 of milk, I'm full. Right. There's no room. Right. You know, I'm not and animals to take some time to
02:00:34.88 --> 02:00:40.72 digest. Right. That that's a meal. Basically you just stay to stake a big one. That's how I feel.
02:00:40.72 --> 02:00:46.64 Yeah. Well, now if I have a one scoop hitter, I just get one of those hitters.
02:00:46.64 --> 02:00:51.68 Sure. Hitter and then you can go to the engine. Yeah, you can keep moving. You can work out like
02:00:51.68 --> 02:00:54.96 45 minutes later. You can be in the gym. Yeah. I'll be on the map. That makes sense. Actually,
02:00:54.96 --> 02:00:59.68 now that I'm thinking about it, I don't take it. Like, I'll do it for every time. Like, if I
02:00:59.68 --> 02:01:05.52 work out, that's all eat after I work out. Yeah. Well, most of the time, but okay. So here's the
02:01:05.52 --> 02:01:09.60 situation. God home the other day woke up at a crappy hotel somewhere early in the morning, early
02:01:09.60 --> 02:01:14.000 morning flight woke up, didn't work out at the hotel early morning because I knew I was heading back to
02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:19.28 my house where I could be in my home gym. So wait, it got home was hungry. Did a hitter. Did it?
02:01:19.28 --> 02:01:23.20 Yeah. Because I was hung because of the neck the night before. That's what did neat. Why did
02:01:23.20 --> 02:01:31.12 neat was working? So God home, it was, I don't know, it was like pan, God home. Wanted to eat something,
02:01:31.84 --> 02:01:38.56 but still wanted to work out before lunch hitter. Okay. Makes sense. Yeah. And then
02:01:38.56 --> 02:01:43.60 booms still got work to do. I think that's why lunch time came. It wasn't that hungry. Yeah, that hitter.
02:01:45.60 --> 02:01:50.08 Yeah, man. So you just sort of fit it in your whole thing. Yeah. But yeah. And then consider the joint
02:01:50.08 --> 02:01:55.92 we're in the crew oil boom every day. Join square away. Yeah. I didn't mean for that to run,
02:01:55.92 --> 02:02:02.16 but it does. It's all good. It's good. Also, good way to support. We have a store. Technically,
02:02:02.16 --> 02:02:08.24 Jocco has a store. I help make it so we have a store. Affirmative. Either way, it's called
02:02:08.24 --> 02:02:15.44 Jocco store. You know, Rashguards are available. Rashguards under a ghee. Yes or no, what's your opinion?
02:02:15.44 --> 02:02:19.20 Well, yeah, whatever you like first of all, some people mandate it.
02:02:19.20 --> 02:02:23.60 Oh, there's some schools that it is mandatory. You will wear a Rashguard under your ghee. Okay.
02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.24 There's some schools where you're not allowed to. Are you allowed? Can you wear them in a
02:02:28.24 --> 02:02:31.36 turn? Some turn them into your allowed to. Some turn them into your not allowed to. There's some rules
02:02:31.36 --> 02:02:35.92 out there. Okay. So find that out and then you can get one of these Rashguards that say something
02:02:35.92 --> 02:02:44.56 on them like good after it or something like that. Yeah. And yeah, Rashguards t-shirts, you can get hats.
02:02:44.56 --> 02:02:48.96 Yeah. So good hats on there. Yeah. Flex fit. If you're into it,
02:02:48.96 --> 02:02:53.04 okay. Jocco's not into Flex fit. Yeah. Okay. A digger. Did we figure out the numbers yet?
02:02:53.04 --> 02:02:57.68 Figure out which more popular? No. Which one do people like more? We don't know yet. We don't
02:02:57.68 --> 02:03:02.16 know yet. I don't know. I remember the fact, I remember the Flex fit phase. But I think we're out of it.
02:03:02.16 --> 02:03:06.000 Man, I think we're back to, I think everyone in America's back to truckers. Oh, like that's kind of
02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:10.32 what we're doing now. I think that's what America. I think America's on board with trucker ads. I could be wrong
02:03:10.32 --> 02:03:15.52 though because we know my fashion sense is completely in the don't know. I'm existing. Yeah, you're
02:03:15.52 --> 02:03:20.72 out of the set about that. So yeah. I don't know. I'll find out and report back. But if you want to
02:03:20.72 --> 02:03:25.84 shirt, you know, these shirts, the ones that say discipline, you go free to boom. That's where you
02:03:25.84 --> 02:03:33.20 can get them. Jocco's store also look one with Jocco's head on it. This is good. More than a few people
02:03:33.92 --> 02:03:37.76 have said, hey man, I really like, you know, your stuff. But I'm not wearing a shirt with your
02:03:37.76 --> 02:03:41.52 joint head on it. Yeah. It's not for everybody. It's not for everybody. Not for everybody.
02:03:41.52 --> 02:03:48.40 Somebody said, hey, is there a shirt with your head on it to me? Oh, and it reminded me. Well,
02:03:48.40 --> 02:03:56.64 yes, it is one day. Jocco designed. The thing, sure. Actually, yeah, so that's one little factoid.
02:03:57.28 --> 02:04:03.12 What's a factoid? Small factoid. That many people don't know. A lot of the designs that we
02:04:03.12 --> 02:04:11.04 year part of, like, you know, echelon front and, you know, some of these designs. Jocco, Joc, you made the designs.
02:04:11.04 --> 02:04:14.24 You didn't make the official one, but you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. With your left hand or whatever,
02:04:14.24 --> 02:04:19.92 because like, you drew the design. The concept is mine. Yeah. The concept is mine. But you physically drew it,
02:04:19.92 --> 02:04:23.52 though, that's the thing. Yeah. It seems like it's not like you said, hey, I wanted to do this and say,
02:04:23.52 --> 02:04:27.12 you like drew it out. A picture's worth a thousand more. I'm not writing you a thousand worth
02:04:27.12 --> 02:04:31.92 paragraph with that echelon front signal. What's a jocco podcast thing is going to look like,
02:04:31.92 --> 02:04:37.76 or what the jocco white tea, whatever. Good draw. But there it is. Do it. Yeah. So you're technically a
02:04:37.76 --> 02:04:43.52 designer. Do the ideas. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. People don't know that. Now they do. And the last is called

02:06:50.08 --> 02:06:54.96 you use it for. It's good anyway. They got a lot of cool stuff on there like that like warrior bars and whatnot.
02:06:54.96 --> 02:07:02.56 Yeah. Where it bars can be it's like a beef jerky but not jerky. It's like a you know it. Look at
02:07:02.56 --> 02:07:10.000 it's good super uh uh hot dance in like protein and nutrient scenario anyway on it dot com slash jockel.
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:17.28 Good spot. Don't forget we got the psychological warfare album that you can get that has discussions
02:07:18.08 --> 02:07:24.72 tracks if you will about out of a cum some moments a weakness that you might hit and we are working on
02:07:24.72 --> 02:07:33.04 the next one. We're not quite there yet. So we're working on it but yeah psychological warfare.
02:07:33.04 --> 02:07:38.24 It's you can get that anywhere iTunes Google play whatever mb3 platforms are out there. Yeah.
02:07:38.24 --> 02:07:46.16 Again also jockel white tea. Yes. The phenomenon. It's funny like I know and people know
02:07:46.16 --> 02:07:51.76 our rea and I know and never really was into tea. Actually even when the the video called the dry tea
02:07:51.76 --> 02:07:55.92 came out I was like cool because I was thinking I'm on the button. You were just you were just playing.
02:07:55.92 --> 02:07:59.92 You were just going along with it. Which you were in the game. The here's the thing though. I was going
02:07:59.92 --> 02:08:04.40 along with it. I was giving I was like a what he called back and listened to those podcasts and see
02:08:04.40 --> 02:08:08.80 if you were trying to act like you in the game even though we now know you weren't. Well that's going to make you
02:08:08.80 --> 02:08:14.08 whole your whole deal suspect. But it this way I was in the game but it was like because I was like on the
02:08:14.08 --> 02:08:18.56 hype train you know how like I was like hey man everybody I'm doing this new thing and you're like
02:08:18.56 --> 02:08:23.84 fuck you just you know that just made you sound worse. Well hey man that's the truth and everyone's
02:08:23.84 --> 02:08:27.92 going to be such the hype. How do we even know what you're saying right now? It's true about it. Well
02:08:27.92 --> 02:08:31.44 maybe it's all hype maybe even now you got to find out for yourself that's the thing.
02:08:31.44 --> 02:08:39.28 You have a point. That's the question. Maybe this is the thing. So I taste like my hate cool cool
02:08:39.28 --> 02:08:43.84 but it kind of you know kind of wore off. I don't drink tea that much but the cans came out and
02:08:43.84 --> 02:08:48.88 what am I doing pounding freaking tea all day is that hype no because I wouldn't be pounding it
02:08:48.88 --> 02:08:55.20 in every day. That's true. You wouldn't be texting me for more boxes to be delivered to your home.
02:08:55.20 --> 02:09:00.80 Yeah. If you weren't. Yeah. The actual tea train. Yeah we wouldn't be running out. I'll tell you that.
02:09:00.80 --> 02:09:06.64 Yeah. That wouldn't be the case. JP. JP sends me pictures of just Jocco White tea. He asked me
02:09:06.64 --> 02:09:13.60 today how much how much is there any amount of Jocco White tea that's not out of me? Yeah you
02:09:13.60 --> 02:09:18.64 got to see that. You got to find out like fully on the train. He might be one level over the train
02:09:18.64 --> 02:09:25.04 and into like the zone of whatever addiction. Yeah so Jocco books got some out there.
02:09:25.04 --> 02:09:30.08 Way the Warrior Kid Marks mission those two books. Man that's one thing being up here. How many
02:09:30.08 --> 02:09:33.84 people have come up to me and said my kids do in Jocco. My kids do in Austin School. My kids do in
02:09:33.84 --> 02:09:38.24 Pulps. Thank you so much for writing the Warrior Kid books. So if you want your kid to
02:09:38.72 --> 02:09:44.32 work out to train hard to eat right to study to do good in school. Hey the last sounds like they
02:09:44.32 --> 02:09:48.40 might be good things. Yes. Get your book. Get the way of the Warrior Kid. Your kid is not going to
02:09:48.40 --> 02:09:54.48 listen to you as much as they're going to listen to an outside source. Make the outside source
02:09:54.48 --> 02:09:59.68 something that you agree with. Some that's told me to work hard, study hard, train hard.
02:10:01.60 --> 02:10:07.52 Way the Warrior Kid Marks mission. Also got the Dispondical Freedom Field Manual. I like seeing
02:10:07.52 --> 02:10:12.80 how many people give this as a gift to people. You know just got this as a gift. I'll see that on social
02:10:12.80 --> 02:10:20.48 media and then they get off stoked on it. So that's a little instruction manual on how to get after
02:10:20.48 --> 02:10:29.52 it period. If you want the audio version, it is not unautable. It is on iTunes, Amazon, music,
02:10:29.52 --> 02:10:36.72 Google Play as an album. Extreme ownership. That's the book that lay for an I wrote. Combat
02:10:36.72 --> 02:10:42.96 leadership lessons that you can apply to your business to your life. DiCottomy of leadership. Listen
02:10:42.96 --> 02:10:47.84 podcast one thirty eight. We read a couple excerpts from it. That's coming out September 25th. If you
02:10:47.84 --> 02:10:55.84 want to get a copy of first a dish order it now. If you want third a dish fourth a dish. If you
02:10:55.84 --> 02:11:02.08 want to be walking around with a big flag that says, hey I procrastinated. I'm a procrastinator.
02:11:02.96 --> 02:11:09.76 I waited. I didn't execute. I didn't prioritize next cue. I didn't keep things simple. If you
02:11:09.76 --> 02:11:14.24 want to have that flag, you want to support that flag? Hold off. Don't order it. Get the fourth
02:11:14.24 --> 02:11:20.08 a dish. Those are dishes are going to go out quick. Because here's the deal. The the
02:11:20.88 --> 02:11:26.56 publishers. They're a conservative. We know you're first books. Your first few books have
02:11:26.56 --> 02:11:31.36 sold well, but that's no guarantee for the next one. We probably should only run this many.
02:11:31.36 --> 02:11:36.000 We don't know. Just to see. We can run more. Take the takes in a little bit more time for people
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:42.000 to get him. It's okay. I'll live. No, actually they won't. They'll actually die for a good time.
02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:50.000 So get that first a dish going. Now this is cool. If we as a group order enough now,
02:11:50.80 --> 02:11:55.76 everyone in that first group will get first a dish. Because they'll print more first
02:11:55.76 --> 02:12:02.000 additions, which is the goal. That way more people don't have to bear the shame.
02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:09.68 And some people say, oh, I had first a dish, but I gave it away. Now I have a new one. Don't
02:12:09.68 --> 02:12:14.88 do that. Keep the first a dish. That's kind of like when you somebody sent me the British
02:12:14.88 --> 02:12:19.36 a dish of about face. First a dish British a dish. It's a different cover.
02:12:19.36 --> 02:12:27.04 I'm about face. So somebody sent me from England about face the book, England,
02:12:27.04 --> 02:12:34.24 copy, British one. So I got that in my bookshelf. That's different. The one day I want to
02:12:34.24 --> 02:12:40.40 take pictures. So I like have things that are the same. Like when I like I have flipflops, I
02:12:40.40 --> 02:12:45.92 wear flipflops around. Sure. I have nine pairs all the same. I have a belt face. I got 10 12
02:12:45.92 --> 02:12:51.20 copies of it. Just racked up. Cool. I got my same watch. You know, I mean, these watch I got six.
02:12:51.92 --> 02:12:55.20 One of them might be broken. No, a couple of them are broken, but I keep them for spare parts.
02:12:55.84 --> 02:12:59.44 What can I see? What can I what kind of what kind of running shoes do I have? They're all the same.
02:12:59.44 --> 02:13:02.48 Work out shoes there. My workout shoes, my run shoes are all the same. Boom. The
02:13:02.48 --> 02:13:08.32 thing. What about my workout clothing? Well, all the same. Never think about it. What about
02:13:08.32 --> 02:13:12.08 that shirt? That big tree shirt? That's the same. How many of these are got a lot of them?
02:13:12.08 --> 02:13:16.80 So why we could go in my house and just take a picture of watches flipflops, sneakers.
02:13:18.08 --> 02:13:23.44 Short. You and my shorts. I wear the same damn shorts all the time. So we're just, we're just doing it.
02:13:24.48 --> 02:13:30.72 But for sending me and I'm I'm going to send the person that sent me the British a dish.
02:13:30.72 --> 02:13:36.96 I'm going to send him some kind of necophys of some books of mine. Um,
02:13:36.96 --> 02:13:41.28 hey, on top of that, we're going to leadership consulting company. Me,
02:13:42.64 --> 02:13:50.000 life-bab and JP to Nell Dave Burke, Flynn Cochrane, Mike Surreli. We solve problems through leadership.

02:14:03.44 --> 02:14:08.96 speak to your company, go to echelonfront.com. That's what you don't call speaking agency.
02:14:11.12 --> 02:14:16.88 Just go to echelonfront.com. We have the muster. Real close to sold out. I'm not sure if it's
02:14:16.88 --> 02:14:25.12 sold out yet. But muster, 006, San Francisco, October 17, 18th, registered extremotorship.com. That's
02:14:25.12 --> 02:14:34.88 the premier leadership conference in the world. Sure. I think so. Actually, no, in the universe.
02:14:34.88 --> 02:14:39.92 Sure. I don't think they have any good leadership conferences on Mars. I think Mars is better.
02:14:39.92 --> 02:14:42.72 Yeah. They do have one. Yeah. It's probably all hot.
02:14:44.88 --> 02:14:49.36 Cold. So yeah. So yeah. The muster. Zero sirs. Kaging still get questions. Like, hey,
02:14:49.36 --> 02:14:55.92 I'm 58 years old and I have a bad knee. Would I be able to do the muster? The answer is yes.
02:14:55.92 --> 02:15:01.92 The muster is anyone can do the physical demands that the muster are very, very little. If any,
02:15:01.92 --> 02:15:05.68 if you don't, you don't have to come and do the morning PT's the morning physical training.
02:15:06.40 --> 02:15:10.88 You can completely not come to that. You can, you're more than welcome to come. And if you come,
02:15:10.88 --> 02:15:14.40 you can just watch or you could come or you could do the minimum that you can do. And that's fine.
02:15:14.40 --> 02:15:19.28 So there's no minimum physical standards for participation at the muster. If you feel like you need
02:15:19.28 --> 02:15:26.64 to come, come. And also on top of the muster, we have another event that we're doing for
02:15:27.44 --> 02:15:31.36 uniform personnel. So military law enforcement board patrol firefighters,
02:15:32.08 --> 02:15:36.16 corrections officers. I've been adding that one in paramedics.

02:15:40.96 --> 02:15:48.72 It's a one day leadership seminar for those folks in those dynamic leadership environments.

02:15:55.52 --> 02:16:02.64 extremownership.com. And of course, we also now have EF overwatch. We are connecting spec ops veterans
02:16:02.64 --> 02:16:11.12 and the companies that want to hire spec ops veterans and combat aviation. Combat aviation and
02:16:11.12 --> 02:16:15.92 spec ops companies need leaders out there. And we are we have leaders that we're connected with.
02:16:15.92 --> 02:16:22.24 So we're trying to place them. That's EF overwatch.com. And right now, we've got an awesome response
02:16:22.24 --> 02:16:27.52 from all of our other brothers and sisters in the military. So we're working on something right now to
02:16:27.52 --> 02:16:36.96 open up this to everyone. And until we see you at the muster or at the roll call or maybe we won't
02:16:36.96 --> 02:16:42.24 even see you until another year from now at the immersion camp next time in Maine. But until then,
02:16:42.24 --> 02:16:50.16 if you want to continue hanging out with us virtually, we are all up on the intro webs on Instagram,
02:16:50.16 --> 02:17:00.48 Twitter and on that Facebook. That goes at Eko Charles and I am at Jocca Willink and

02:17:22.56 --> 02:17:32.16 And to everyone else, remember that life is not easy. But it's not supposed to be easy.
02:17:32.16 --> 02:17:37.28 Life is a test and it's a hard test and sometimes you might do great on that test.
02:17:37.28 --> 02:17:44.88 And that's super. But sometimes that test doesn't go so well.
02:17:47.36 --> 02:17:53.28 Then sometimes you might falter and sometimes you might fail and sometimes you might even break
02:17:53.28 --> 02:18:05.12 and when that happens, use it. Use it to make yourself faster and stronger and smarter and better
02:18:05.12 --> 02:18:12.40 and take a look at how and why you broke so that it does not happen again. Identify your
02:18:12.40 --> 02:18:24.48 weaknesses come up with a plan of attack and get after it. And until next time, this is Eko and Jocco.
02:18:24.48 --> 02:18:40.80 adult
