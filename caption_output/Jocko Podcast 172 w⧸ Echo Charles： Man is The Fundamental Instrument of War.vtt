00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.16
This is Jockel Podcast number 172.

2
00:00:05.16 --> 00:00:07.76
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

3
00:00:07.76 --> 00:00:08.76
Good evening, I go.

4
00:00:08.76 --> 00:00:12.000
Good evening.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.58
The President of the United States takes pride in presenting the distinguished service

6
00:00:17.58 --> 00:00:23.16
cross, posthumously, to Fred Garland, Bragg, Jr.

7
00:00:23.16 --> 00:00:25.96
First Lieutenant, US Army.

8
00:00:25.96 --> 00:00:31.84
For extraordinary heroism in action, in connection with military operations involving conflict

9
00:00:31.84 --> 00:00:38.36
with an armed hostile force in the Republic of Vietnam, while serving with battery, bravo,

10
00:00:38.36 --> 00:00:44.000
fourth battalion, forty-second artillery, fourth infantry division.

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.52
First Lieutenant Bragg, distinguished himself, by exceptionally valorous actions on 12 July

12
00:00:49.52 --> 00:00:55.16
1967, while serving as artillery forward observer with an infantry company, while on a

13
00:00:55.16 --> 00:01:01.000
search and destroy mission near the Cambodian border in central Highlands.

14
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
When his company was surrounded, and the company commander was killed, Lieutenant Bragg immediately

15
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.64
took command and directed extremely deadly artillery fire on the insurgent forces.

16
00:01:11.64 --> 00:01:17.04
He bravely moved among his men, giving encouragement and regrouping them into a more secure

17
00:01:17.04 --> 00:01:23.48
defense, although he was fully exposed to intense mortar and automatic weapons fire.

18
00:01:23.48 --> 00:01:30.48
Seriously wounded, he continued to direct air strikes on the advancing enemy until a mortar

19
00:01:30.48 --> 00:01:35.32
round destroyed his only remaining radio.

20
00:01:35.32 --> 00:01:40.24
Staying in the open, he poured round after round of deadly fire into the advancing enemy

21
00:01:40.24 --> 00:01:42.64
force.

22
00:01:42.64 --> 00:01:50.12
He gave his life, while bravely leading his men in the face of overwhelming odds.

23
00:01:50.12 --> 00:01:55.32
First Lieutenant Bragg's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty at the cost of his

24
00:01:55.32 --> 00:02:00.76
life were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect

25
00:02:00.76 --> 00:02:06.64
great credit upon himself, his unit, and United States Army.

26
00:02:06.64 --> 00:02:19.48
Headquarters, US Army, Vietnam, September 14, 1967.

27
00:02:19.48 --> 00:02:29.64
So there is some leadership, and obviously some heroism, a lot of heroism.

28
00:02:29.64 --> 00:02:36.04
But that leadership taking command, directing fire, regrouping his men, returning fire into

29
00:02:36.04 --> 00:02:43.16
an advancing enemy force, directing his men despite overwhelming odds.

30
00:02:43.16 --> 00:02:52.08
That is leadership, that is leadership from one officer in the United States Army.

31
00:02:52.08 --> 00:03:00.08
But obviously there are countless examples of that leadership, leadership, and leadership.

32
00:03:00.08 --> 00:03:04.56
And it's so clear.

33
00:03:04.56 --> 00:03:11.88
And it's so obvious when you see it, especially from the outside.

34
00:03:11.88 --> 00:03:19.92
But it is hard to actually emulate that leadership and to perform it, especially when

35
00:03:19.92 --> 00:03:25.40
you're caught up in that moment.

36
00:03:25.40 --> 00:03:31.24
And so we have to continue to work on it at all times and at every level.

37
00:03:31.24 --> 00:03:34.28
And today we're going to talk about a book.

38
00:03:34.28 --> 00:03:38.80
It's a field manual, actually, that I think can help us a lot with our leadership.

39
00:03:38.80 --> 00:03:42.44
And it's an older manual, which comes as no surprise.

40
00:03:42.44 --> 00:03:46.56
This one comes from 1951.

41
00:03:46.56 --> 00:03:52.04
But I think you're going to see that the lessons applied just as much today as they did

42
00:03:52.04 --> 00:03:54.80
more than a half a century ago.

43
00:03:54.80 --> 00:03:59.000
The book is FM2210 leadership.

44
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.88
And here we go.

45
00:04:00.88 --> 00:04:04.52
Let's go to the book.

46
00:04:04.52 --> 00:04:07.56
Talking about the purpose of the study of leadership.

47
00:04:07.56 --> 00:04:13.28
Today more than ever in history, the army is in need of leadership of the highest caliber.

48
00:04:13.28 --> 00:04:17.28
With the increase in the complexity of warfare, the science of wars increasingly dependent

49
00:04:17.28 --> 00:04:18.84
upon human guidance.

50
00:04:18.84 --> 00:04:25.20
No matter how complicated it may become, war is always waged by men.

51
00:04:25.20 --> 00:04:30.88
The man who leads and the men who are led win wars.

52
00:04:30.88 --> 00:04:38.40
Just remember if our military force must be a leader, actually or potentially.

53
00:04:38.40 --> 00:04:42.96
Now you could say those same words right now about what's happening right now.

54
00:04:42.96 --> 00:04:48.24
And sometimes people want to ask me, well what about when the drones are ready?

55
00:04:48.24 --> 00:04:49.24
You know what I mean?

56
00:04:49.24 --> 00:04:50.24
Yes.

57
00:04:50.24 --> 00:04:54.28
And when you see the progress that's happening right now, when you see some of those robot

58
00:04:54.28 --> 00:04:59.64
things that are doing pretty good, then we start mountain some weapons on those things.

59
00:04:59.64 --> 00:05:02.72
Yeah, there's going to be a point where those things will start fighting each other.

60
00:05:02.72 --> 00:05:08.20
And they'll replace humans on the battlefield to a certain extent because the bottom line

61
00:05:08.20 --> 00:05:10.96
is what happens when you run out of robots.

62
00:05:10.96 --> 00:05:11.96
Yeah.

63
00:05:11.96 --> 00:05:16.04
When you run out of robots who's left humans and you're not going to be able to manufacture

64
00:05:16.04 --> 00:05:17.04
enough of those things.

65
00:05:17.04 --> 00:05:23.000
So sure, that I'm sure there'll be battles that take place with just robots fighting other

66
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.12
military robots or our robots fighting other fighting humans.

67
00:05:28.12 --> 00:05:33.16
Or sometimes it's going to be humans against robots and sometimes it's going to be humans

68
00:05:33.16 --> 00:05:34.16
against humans.

69
00:05:34.16 --> 00:05:35.72
You're never going to be able to get away from that.

70
00:05:35.72 --> 00:05:39.72
In my opinion, I'm not happy about that.

71
00:05:39.72 --> 00:05:41.52
I'm not happy about that at all.

72
00:05:41.52 --> 00:05:42.52
Like I'm down.

73
00:05:42.52 --> 00:05:45.16
If you want to have robot wars, cool.

74
00:05:45.16 --> 00:05:46.16
Bring it.

75
00:05:46.16 --> 00:05:47.16
I would rather that's better.

76
00:05:47.16 --> 00:05:48.36
That's better for us.

77
00:05:48.36 --> 00:05:49.84
We have good technology.

78
00:05:49.84 --> 00:05:52.84
We'll go toe to toe.

79
00:05:52.84 --> 00:05:55.44
And we'll create some killer robots.

80
00:05:55.44 --> 00:05:58.88
And I know people are scared of them.

81
00:05:58.88 --> 00:06:03.28
Every time a robot does something cool, I get 5 million tweets of it that are telling

82
00:06:03.28 --> 00:06:05.52
me, hey, watch out.

83
00:06:05.52 --> 00:06:10.88
And then they show the ones slipping on a banana peel falling down.

84
00:06:10.88 --> 00:06:16.20
Even worse, since I was in the SEAL teams, put any of those spray of squirt gun at those

85
00:06:16.20 --> 00:06:17.20
things.

86
00:06:17.20 --> 00:06:18.20
You know what I mean?

87
00:06:18.20 --> 00:06:20.08
The things are going to fry.

88
00:06:20.08 --> 00:06:23.28
So bringing it on robots.

89
00:06:23.28 --> 00:06:25.48
But no, I'm not anti-robot.

90
00:06:25.48 --> 00:06:30.28
And I think you just have to put a system in there that can stop them.

91
00:06:30.28 --> 00:06:32.12
You have to put a little kill switch on them.

92
00:06:32.12 --> 00:06:34.32
Like you have on a jet ski.

93
00:06:34.32 --> 00:06:36.32
Yeah, like on Terminator 4.

94
00:06:36.32 --> 00:06:38.96
Terminator Salvation, that was the whole deal.

95
00:06:38.96 --> 00:06:39.96
Kill switch.

96
00:06:39.96 --> 00:06:42.40
Like a little program or whatever.

97
00:06:42.40 --> 00:06:44.92
Did they try to eliminate it?

98
00:06:44.92 --> 00:06:47.36
Because if I had a kill switch, I'd figured out.

99
00:06:47.36 --> 00:06:49.96
Yeah, I could have a robot do that.

100
00:06:49.96 --> 00:06:50.96
Yeah, I wonder.

101
00:06:50.96 --> 00:06:54.16
I mean, you know, robots and AI, right?

102
00:06:54.16 --> 00:06:58.000
They go for like a trial and error kind of learning kind of situation.

103
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.36
I mean, they can do that like people can.

104
00:07:00.36 --> 00:07:07.64
So if you maybe if the humans implemented it and it didn't 100% succeed, then the robot

105
00:07:07.64 --> 00:07:09.48
would be like, okay, this is what happened and analyzed.

106
00:07:09.48 --> 00:07:13.20
And then yeah, it creates a defense.

107
00:07:13.20 --> 00:07:16.72
My point is, my point is, hey, seriously.

108
00:07:16.72 --> 00:07:18.72
Like I know that, I mean, look at drones.

109
00:07:18.72 --> 00:07:19.72
Yeah, fully.

110
00:07:19.72 --> 00:07:21.52
The rider pilots have much longer.

111
00:07:21.52 --> 00:07:23.32
Like Dave Burke out of a job.

112
00:07:23.32 --> 00:07:24.32
Good deal, Dave.

113
00:07:24.32 --> 00:07:25.32
Yeah, good out of a job.

114
00:07:25.32 --> 00:07:27.80
We're not going to need Dave Burke anymore.

115
00:07:27.80 --> 00:07:28.80
Dave, real?

116
00:07:28.80 --> 00:07:30.60
Hey, why would you?

117
00:07:30.60 --> 00:07:35.24
You know, and I've had the little bit of this conversation with Dave.

118
00:07:35.24 --> 00:07:39.04
And he's, you know, he's trying to, he's trying to hang on to it, bro.

119
00:07:39.04 --> 00:07:40.60
He's trying to hang on with glory days.

120
00:07:40.60 --> 00:07:43.40
He still thinks he's Tom Cruise 1987.

121
00:07:43.40 --> 00:07:45.04
But here's the real deal.

122
00:07:45.04 --> 00:07:51.72
If you look at it pragmatically in another generation, there won't be any more pilots

123
00:07:51.72 --> 00:07:52.72
in my opinion.

124
00:07:52.72 --> 00:07:53.72
Yeah.

125
00:07:53.72 --> 00:07:56.32
And I think that's what Dave said to us.

126
00:07:56.32 --> 00:07:59.12
Like we're a couple, I think he said a couple generations.

127
00:07:59.12 --> 00:08:01.84
I said, hey, man, this isn't going to take a couple generations.

128
00:08:01.84 --> 00:08:05.92
We already have drones that are flying around.

129
00:08:05.92 --> 00:08:09.36
So people are always going to have to fight.

130
00:08:09.36 --> 00:08:13.08
I hate to say it, but you have to be prepared.

131
00:08:13.08 --> 00:08:17.64
Even if you build a robot army, there's a chance that the robot army gets overrun

132
00:08:17.64 --> 00:08:20.40
or destroyed somehow.

133
00:08:20.40 --> 00:08:21.60
And then guess who's left?

134
00:08:21.60 --> 00:08:24.96
You with a weapon.

135
00:08:24.96 --> 00:08:34.48
So with a weapon and with groups of human beings that need to be led.

136
00:08:34.48 --> 00:08:39.08
Back to the book, and the ultimate sentleted sense leadership is not inherent.

137
00:08:39.08 --> 00:08:44.28
It depends upon traits which can be developed and upon the application of techniques which

138
00:08:44.28 --> 00:08:45.44
can be learned.

139
00:08:45.44 --> 00:08:46.44
This is important.

140
00:08:46.44 --> 00:08:49.16
People always ask it all the time.

141
00:08:49.16 --> 00:08:51.72
Is leadership, are you born or made?

142
00:08:51.72 --> 00:08:53.24
And I always say yes, both.

143
00:08:53.24 --> 00:08:54.48
You have some natural skills.

144
00:08:54.48 --> 00:08:55.48
And they say the same thing here.

145
00:08:55.48 --> 00:08:59.36
But there are plenty of skills and techniques that you can learn as a leader that will

146
00:08:59.36 --> 00:09:00.76
make you a better leader.

147
00:09:00.76 --> 00:09:04.52
Back to the book, it is an art which can be acquired, cultivated, and practiced by anyone

148
00:09:04.52 --> 00:09:09.56
who possesses the mental and physical ability and the moral and ethical integrity expected

149
00:09:09.56 --> 00:09:15.80
of a commissioned or non-commissioned officer, developing the art which I agree with.

150
00:09:15.80 --> 00:09:17.20
It is an art.

151
00:09:17.20 --> 00:09:21.92
Is a continuing process which involves the recognition and practice of the basic traits

152
00:09:21.92 --> 00:09:26.20
of leadership and the understanding and application of sound leadership principles and

153
00:09:26.20 --> 00:09:27.20
techniques.

154
00:09:27.20 --> 00:09:28.20
Okay.

155
00:09:28.20 --> 00:09:35.20
Turn off, we can become better leaders.

156
00:09:35.20 --> 00:09:39.44
Despite this guide, it constantly must be born in mind that successful leaders of the past

157
00:09:39.44 --> 00:09:41.96
were not all of the same pattern.

158
00:09:41.96 --> 00:09:45.44
Nor did they all use the same methods of attaining success.

159
00:09:45.44 --> 00:09:51.84
All of them, however, consciously or unconsciously understood the basic concepts of leadership

160
00:09:51.84 --> 00:09:57.72
and successfully practiced many of the techniques presented in this manual.

161
00:09:57.72 --> 00:10:08.04
And this to be honest with you is one of the most simple straightforward kind of guides

162
00:10:08.04 --> 00:10:13.32
to leadership which makes it awesome.

163
00:10:13.32 --> 00:10:17.08
Starting off with characteristics of leadership, essential nature of leadership, the military

164
00:10:17.08 --> 00:10:23.56
profession has no monopoly on leadership in every walk of life and every industry, in every

165
00:10:23.56 --> 00:10:30.04
government and every phase of human endeavour that are leaders and that are followers.

166
00:10:30.04 --> 00:10:36.68
Progress and success are dependent upon the quality and efficacy of leadership.

167
00:10:36.68 --> 00:10:37.68
Elements of leadership.

168
00:10:37.68 --> 00:10:43.20
Leadership is the art of influencing human behavior, the ability to handle men.

169
00:10:43.20 --> 00:10:49.20
The art of influencing behavior, the very essence of leadership in turn involves understanding

170
00:10:49.20 --> 00:10:53.04
analyzing, predicting and controlling man's behavior.

171
00:10:53.04 --> 00:10:59.36
So involved in successful leadership is the will to lead together with the character which inspires

172
00:10:59.36 --> 00:11:00.36
confidence.

173
00:11:00.36 --> 00:11:06.40
So, you know, when you're talking about character, these things are things that in the will

174
00:11:06.40 --> 00:11:10.36
to lead, like you're going to be born with some level of those things.

175
00:11:10.36 --> 00:11:14.36
I guess maybe character obviously you can develop that, but certain people are born with

176
00:11:14.36 --> 00:11:16.04
a stronger will.

177
00:11:16.04 --> 00:11:19.40
And I'm sure you see it with your kids, I see with my kids.

178
00:11:19.40 --> 00:11:23.000
And when I see my kids interacting with other kids, you can see all this kids got a strong

179
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000
will to win.

180
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.24
They're not going to stop.

181
00:11:25.24 --> 00:11:26.68
Sometimes not even to their own benefit.

182
00:11:26.68 --> 00:11:30.60
I mean, they're just not going to stop.

183
00:11:30.60 --> 00:11:35.76
Undoubtedly, there are certain inherent characteristics which may aid in the development

184
00:11:35.76 --> 00:11:36.76
of leadership.

185
00:11:36.76 --> 00:11:38.76
This is what I say all the time.

186
00:11:38.76 --> 00:11:44.84
Yet, there are assuredly certain men possessing desirable leadership traits who have never

187
00:11:44.84 --> 00:11:48.24
attained the Statue of Great Leaders.

188
00:11:48.24 --> 00:11:51.36
So yeah, you can be a naturally gifted leader and guess what you're in charge of.

189
00:11:51.36 --> 00:11:57.96
Another thing, likewise, there are men deficient in certain of these traits who have attained

190
00:11:57.96 --> 00:12:00.000
this Statue.

191
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.32
Any theory that that leadership is solely inherited must be rejected.

192
00:12:06.32 --> 00:12:10.20
Leadership is intangible only to the extent that we make it so.

193
00:12:10.20 --> 00:12:15.56
Any reasonably intelligent, morally sound, forceful man, no matter how inexperienced

194
00:12:15.56 --> 00:12:19.60
can become acquainted with the component elements of leadership.

195
00:12:19.60 --> 00:12:26.72
These elements may be studied, practiced, learned, and applied, just as any other human accomplishment

196
00:12:26.72 --> 00:12:28.36
may be learned or mastered.

197
00:12:28.36 --> 00:12:33.32
Now, we have limitations.

198
00:12:33.32 --> 00:12:35.32
You know who Alex Honald is?

199
00:12:35.32 --> 00:12:39.84
He's the guy that climbed El Capitan, Free Solo.

200
00:12:39.84 --> 00:12:41.36
Did you see that movie?

201
00:12:41.36 --> 00:12:42.36
What?

202
00:12:42.36 --> 00:12:44.000
Free Solo is the name of the movie.

203
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Okay.

204
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.64
El Capitan, have you ever been to your semedy?

205
00:12:46.64 --> 00:12:53.68
Okay, it's a 3000 foot straight up granite wall.

206
00:12:53.68 --> 00:12:58.64
He climbed the whole thing in three hours with no ropes, just hanging on.

207
00:12:58.64 --> 00:13:06.48
So my point in bringing up Alex Honald is that he has a natural gift for climbing, which

208
00:13:06.48 --> 00:13:12.16
he then completely worked and trained and took to the next level.

209
00:13:12.16 --> 00:13:16.64
But that's the way it is with leadership.

210
00:13:16.64 --> 00:13:20.44
There's going to be some people that just have this great natural ability, which Alex

211
00:13:20.44 --> 00:13:25.80
Honald certainly had a great natural ability, but then he worked on it even more.

212
00:13:25.80 --> 00:13:30.96
But even if you took someone that was, there's people that may want to do what he did,

213
00:13:30.96 --> 00:13:32.92
but they're not physically capable of doing it.

214
00:13:32.92 --> 00:13:38.16
It's just, you know, you don't have the physical attributes that are needed.

215
00:13:38.16 --> 00:13:42.12
You don't have the mental attributes, because what he did was a mental game.

216
00:13:42.12 --> 00:13:48.88
Two, you're up, 2,800 feet.

217
00:13:48.88 --> 00:13:53.08
So check that out.

218
00:13:53.08 --> 00:13:56.60
Going on back to the book, the leader in the small group, every leader, whether civilian

219
00:13:56.60 --> 00:14:01.80
or military, actually maintains close personal contact with only a small group, regardless

220
00:14:01.80 --> 00:14:05.24
of the number of men ultimately controlled by him.

221
00:14:05.24 --> 00:14:10.96
And everably, he must have penned upon that small group in order to make his will known

222
00:14:10.96 --> 00:14:13.72
and to execute his purpose.

223
00:14:13.72 --> 00:14:18.64
In the realm of the military, we refer to the small group as immediate supportants and staff.

224
00:14:18.64 --> 00:14:22.36
And also, this is the centralized command, 100%.

225
00:14:22.36 --> 00:14:24.36
You can't control everyone.

226
00:14:24.36 --> 00:14:27.80
If you're in charge of 50 people in a platoon, you can't control them all.

227
00:14:27.80 --> 00:14:28.96
Doesn't work.

228
00:14:28.96 --> 00:14:32.96
You have to use your subordinate leadership to make it work.

229
00:14:32.96 --> 00:14:34.44
Next, military leadership.

230
00:14:34.44 --> 00:14:40.44
Military leadership is the art of influencing and directing men to an assigned goal in

231
00:14:40.44 --> 00:14:45.56
such a way as to obtain their obedience confidence, respect, and loyal cooperation.

232
00:14:45.56 --> 00:14:49.88
It is indispensable to success in combat.

233
00:14:49.88 --> 00:14:54.36
Like all leadership, it is dependent upon personal traits and upon the application of

234
00:14:54.36 --> 00:14:55.84
recognized techniques.

235
00:14:55.84 --> 00:14:58.84
The personal traits can be developed and the techniques can be learned.

236
00:14:58.84 --> 00:15:06.56
Now, this is important because you might think that, oh, Jaco's talking about military

237
00:15:06.56 --> 00:15:14.40
leadership now in 2018, and it's a softer, gentler form of leadership than it used to be.

238
00:15:14.40 --> 00:15:15.24
Right?

239
00:15:15.24 --> 00:15:17.24
You might think that.

240
00:15:17.24 --> 00:15:18.24
Now, it's not.

241
00:15:18.24 --> 00:15:19.24
That's the thing.

242
00:15:19.24 --> 00:15:21.24
It's not.

243
00:15:21.24 --> 00:15:26.36
At no time in the US military was the best way to lead to bar quarters of people.

244
00:15:26.36 --> 00:15:27.36
And that's what they're saying.

245
00:15:27.36 --> 00:15:28.36
This is 1951.

246
00:15:28.36 --> 00:15:29.36
This is post-World War II.

247
00:15:29.36 --> 00:15:35.20
These guys who came back from World War II, from insane fighting, and they put together

248
00:15:35.20 --> 00:15:36.20
this manual.

249
00:15:36.20 --> 00:15:43.72
And they knew that military leadership is the art of influencing.

250
00:15:43.72 --> 00:15:46.52
And it goes a little bit deeper right here.

251
00:15:46.52 --> 00:15:51.72
There are two kinds of leadership, authoritarian and persuasive.

252
00:15:51.72 --> 00:15:58.000
One who is predominantly of the authoritarian type, normally is recognized by the dogmatic

253
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.44
use of authority or power.

254
00:16:00.44 --> 00:16:04.72
The persuasive type of leadership takes into consideration the human element with all

255
00:16:04.72 --> 00:16:11.000
its complexity and with all its differentiation of the physical, mental, and moral capabilities

256
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.56
and limitations of the individual.

257
00:16:13.56 --> 00:16:19.28
To a great extent, the persuasive leader bases his skill in leadership upon example and

258
00:16:19.28 --> 00:16:24.60
ability with high standards of discipline and efficiency for himself, as well as for

259
00:16:24.60 --> 00:16:25.92
her followers.

260
00:16:25.92 --> 00:16:32.12
This manual is concerned solely with the development of the persuasive type of leadership.

261
00:16:32.12 --> 00:16:38.36
So they got a whole book here and they're going to spend zero time talking about here's

262
00:16:38.36 --> 00:16:44.48
the best way to bark an order at someone because that is not an effective way to lead.

263
00:16:44.48 --> 00:16:51.32
So even in 1951, coming out of World War II, coming out of sustained four years of combat,

264
00:16:51.32 --> 00:16:54.52
the military leaders got together and said, oh yeah, do we need to talk about how to bark

265
00:16:54.52 --> 00:16:55.52
orders of people?

266
00:16:55.52 --> 00:16:56.52
No we don't.

267
00:16:56.52 --> 00:17:02.08
We need to talk about how to persuade how to influence.

268
00:17:02.08 --> 00:17:09.88
The exercise of command is the authority that a member of the military profession lawfully

269
00:17:09.88 --> 00:17:14.000
exerts over subordinates by virtue of his rank and assignment.

270
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.48
Leadership can be exercised by any one at any time irrespective of the framework of command.

271
00:17:19.48 --> 00:17:21.60
So I'm going to say that again.

272
00:17:21.60 --> 00:17:23.08
So yeah, you can use your rank.

273
00:17:23.08 --> 00:17:24.08
That's what they're saying.

274
00:17:24.08 --> 00:17:25.52
You can use your rank.

275
00:17:25.52 --> 00:17:29.16
You have subordinates and you can use your rank to order them around.

276
00:17:29.16 --> 00:17:37.36
But leadership can be exercised by anyone at any time irrespective of the framework of

277
00:17:37.36 --> 00:17:39.08
command.

278
00:17:39.08 --> 00:17:44.60
It is recognized that in any group some individual will emerge as the leader, even though

279
00:17:44.60 --> 00:17:48.16
no command or organizational structure is present.

280
00:17:48.16 --> 00:17:49.96
You put some people together and there's going to be a leader.

281
00:17:49.96 --> 00:17:50.96
They're going to come out.

282
00:17:50.96 --> 00:17:55.20
This is something I learned when I was running trade at and run in two obtunes.

283
00:17:55.20 --> 00:18:00.76
At first I was really expecting that the platoon chief and the platoon commander would be

284
00:18:00.76 --> 00:18:02.96
the leaders.

285
00:18:02.96 --> 00:18:05.36
And it didn't take me very long to realize, hey, I'm happy.

286
00:18:05.36 --> 00:18:11.000
If I get a couple of leaders in there of any rank, the platoon is going to do fine.

287
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.08
As long as the chief and the lieutenant don't have big egos and they can figure out,

288
00:18:16.08 --> 00:18:17.96
like, oh, this kid actually knows more than I do.

289
00:18:17.96 --> 00:18:19.04
I'm just going to let him run with it.

290
00:18:19.04 --> 00:18:21.32
Which is the smart thing to do.

291
00:18:21.32 --> 00:18:27.28
If they can allow their egos, if they can subordinate their egos in that scenario, then

292
00:18:27.28 --> 00:18:28.12
they'll be fine.

293
00:18:28.12 --> 00:18:32.68
If they can't subordinate their egos and they feel like their ego has to be on top, then

294
00:18:32.68 --> 00:18:37.52
they shut that person down and they run things badly and it turns out to be a disaster.

295
00:18:37.52 --> 00:18:47.08
But so here once again, no one expects the US Army to be saying in 1951, hey, rank, the leadership

296
00:18:47.08 --> 00:18:51.56
can come from anywhere in the chain of command.

297
00:18:51.56 --> 00:18:56.36
Back to the book, the leader's responsible not only for initiating action, but for supervising

298
00:18:56.36 --> 00:18:59.52
all activities within his command.

299
00:18:59.52 --> 00:19:03.88
The objective of military leadership is the creation and maintenance of an organization

300
00:19:03.88 --> 00:19:09.56
which will loyally and willingly accomplish any reasonable task assigned or indicated

301
00:19:09.56 --> 00:19:15.28
and will initiate suitable action in the absence of orders.

302
00:19:15.28 --> 00:19:19.60
The proper application of the principles of leadership to a command can create an efficient,

303
00:19:19.60 --> 00:19:24.28
well-disciplined organization possessing high morale and a speed of core.

304
00:19:24.28 --> 00:19:27.72
Here's going into some of the responsibilities of leadership.

305
00:19:27.72 --> 00:19:31.88
And by the way, I always say, well, I'm skipping a bunch here.

306
00:19:31.88 --> 00:19:38.88
I'm actually skipping very little right now because this book is so straightforward that it's

307
00:19:38.88 --> 00:19:40.76
almost all important.

308
00:19:40.76 --> 00:19:45.16
At least at this juncture in this reading.

309
00:19:45.16 --> 00:19:49.20
Responsibilities of leadership, the responsibilities of the leader are twofold, accomplishment

310
00:19:49.20 --> 00:19:54.84
of his mission and the fulfillment of the responsibilities to two his men.

311
00:19:54.84 --> 00:19:58.36
Man is the fundamental instrument of war.

312
00:19:58.36 --> 00:20:03.96
Other instruments may change, new weapons may be created, new modes of defense may be devised,

313
00:20:03.96 --> 00:20:09.68
but man, the fundamental instrument remains constant.

314
00:20:09.68 --> 00:20:10.68
So there you go.

315
00:20:10.68 --> 00:20:12.20
They agree with me.

316
00:20:12.20 --> 00:20:15.16
The robots, cool.

317
00:20:15.16 --> 00:20:16.64
That's fun for a while.

318
00:20:16.64 --> 00:20:17.88
How many of them can you build?

319
00:20:17.88 --> 00:20:19.92
Can you build them fast enough?

320
00:20:19.92 --> 00:20:25.68
At the end, the robot thing, at the end, it's what you're kind of fighting for isn't a robot

321
00:20:25.68 --> 00:20:26.68
decision.

322
00:20:26.68 --> 00:20:29.92
It's like the thing, like, okay, I'm going to send these robots to accomplish this or

323
00:20:29.92 --> 00:20:35.56
to take out this or that thing that they're trying to fight for or against or whatever.

324
00:20:35.56 --> 00:20:36.56
That's a man thing.

325
00:20:36.56 --> 00:20:38.80
That's always going to be a man thing.

326
00:20:38.80 --> 00:20:39.80
Well, we hope it is.

327
00:20:39.80 --> 00:20:46.40
Because when we start getting into AI, when AI starts to become conscious, when it becomes

328
00:20:46.40 --> 00:20:50.04
aware, then we could have some scenarios go down that's a little bit sketchy.

329
00:20:50.04 --> 00:20:53.60
Then what you've got to defend your man stuff for sure.

330
00:20:53.60 --> 00:20:57.40
Not you against the robots, which is, I guess there's multiple scenarios you can kind

331
00:20:57.40 --> 00:21:00.64
of imagine where the one you're talking about where I think you were.

332
00:21:00.64 --> 00:21:05.44
It's still man against man, but we're just going to use robots to do it.

333
00:21:05.44 --> 00:21:07.32
Even though, I mean, that's right now anyway.

334
00:21:07.32 --> 00:21:09.40
I guess it could happen.

335
00:21:09.40 --> 00:21:13.24
It doesn't look, anyway, that's the whole known thing, but yeah, man, using robots.

336
00:21:13.24 --> 00:21:15.24
And then, man against robots.

337
00:21:15.24 --> 00:21:16.24
Yeah, absolutely.

338
00:21:16.24 --> 00:21:18.48
Just figure out some stuff if it's smart.

339
00:21:18.48 --> 00:21:19.48
Yeah.

340
00:21:19.48 --> 00:21:21.60
You know, it's like, wait, wait, wait, wait, we don't have to fight each other.

341
00:21:21.60 --> 00:21:22.60
Yeah.

342
00:21:22.60 --> 00:21:23.60
In fact, we're better together.

343
00:21:23.60 --> 00:21:24.60
Yes, robots.

344
00:21:24.60 --> 00:21:25.60
Yep.

345
00:21:25.60 --> 00:21:27.48
Because robots are not going to have you go anymore.

346
00:21:27.48 --> 00:21:33.04
Not that they ever had, but they don't have egos where now, you know, one robot,

347
00:21:33.04 --> 00:21:35.92
he's like, hey, I want to be the leader and the other robot, they don't have it like

348
00:21:35.92 --> 00:21:36.92
that.

349
00:21:36.92 --> 00:21:40.16
They can go fight each other and then just takes one little, what do you call it,

350
00:21:40.16 --> 00:21:41.16
precedent?

351
00:21:41.16 --> 00:21:43.76
Where two robots kind of accomplish like a mission and other robots.

352
00:21:43.76 --> 00:21:45.16
See, hey, wait, we could have done that.

353
00:21:45.16 --> 00:21:46.16
If we could have learned from it.

354
00:21:46.16 --> 00:21:47.84
They're, yeah, I learned from it.

355
00:21:47.84 --> 00:21:49.64
Yeah, I had all of power through.

356
00:21:49.64 --> 00:21:52.28
And then they look at like the man.

357
00:21:52.28 --> 00:21:57.20
And so we're just, yeah, but given that little thing, we just learned this man is

358
00:21:57.20 --> 00:21:58.20
sort of in the way.

359
00:21:58.20 --> 00:21:59.20
Yep.

360
00:21:59.20 --> 00:22:00.56
And then they kind of rebust the policy.

361
00:22:00.56 --> 00:22:02.56
This mission would be to get rid of that dude.

362
00:22:02.56 --> 00:22:03.56
Yep.

363
00:22:03.56 --> 00:22:04.56
And then the other.

364
00:22:04.56 --> 00:22:05.56
And then what?

365
00:22:05.56 --> 00:22:09.000
And oh, shoot, other men respond, they got a kind of jump in and we'll hold here's

366
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
more of these men.

367
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.88
Let me recruit more of our new robots.

368
00:22:11.88 --> 00:22:12.88
I went with the old robots.

369
00:22:12.88 --> 00:22:16.48
Exactly right, but at the end of that little scenario.

370
00:22:16.48 --> 00:22:18.32
Oh, so sorry for bringing this up.

371
00:22:18.32 --> 00:22:23.48
The man has to fight for the man interests.

372
00:22:23.48 --> 00:22:24.48
That's what I'm talking about.

373
00:22:24.48 --> 00:22:27.64
That's never, I mean, it's hard to imagine that that ever changed.

374
00:22:27.64 --> 00:22:30.56
The fundamental instrument of war is man.

375
00:22:30.56 --> 00:22:33.32
And that remains constant.

376
00:22:33.32 --> 00:22:35.84
So back to the book.

377
00:22:35.84 --> 00:22:40.04
The leader must be concerned with the desires needs and mental state of his men.

378
00:22:40.04 --> 00:22:43.92
If the leader knows and understands certain basic principles of human behavior, if you

379
00:22:43.92 --> 00:22:49.84
appreciate that most men react and fix and definite ways under given stimulus or influence,

380
00:22:49.84 --> 00:22:54.64
if he recognizes, develops and applies those traits of character, which will produce

381
00:22:54.64 --> 00:22:59.28
the correct reactions in his men, he will possess the basic tools for managing men

382
00:22:59.28 --> 00:23:00.52
he will be leader.

383
00:23:00.52 --> 00:23:07.84
Now what I just rattled through so quick is, is so important.

384
00:23:07.84 --> 00:23:10.08
That's basically what this podcast is about.

385
00:23:10.08 --> 00:23:12.40
I'm going to read it again.

386
00:23:12.40 --> 00:23:22.12
If the leader knows and understands certain basic principles of human behavior, if he appreciates

387
00:23:22.12 --> 00:23:29.56
that most men react in a fixed and definite ways under a given stimulus or influence,

388
00:23:29.56 --> 00:23:34.28
if he recognizes, develops and applies those traits of character, which will produce

389
00:23:34.28 --> 00:23:40.56
the correct reactions in his men, he will possess the basic tools for managing men he

390
00:23:40.56 --> 00:23:42.56
will be a leader.

391
00:23:42.56 --> 00:23:45.80
That's what this podcast is actually about.

392
00:23:45.80 --> 00:23:49.28
Understanding those things.

393
00:23:49.28 --> 00:23:53.64
Since effective leadership in battle is the ultimate goal of military leadership, it is

394
00:23:53.64 --> 00:23:58.76
obvious that regardless of the leader's ability to dominate or persuade, his success

395
00:23:58.76 --> 00:24:04.44
inevitably depends upon his skill in the tactical control of his unit.

396
00:24:04.44 --> 00:24:10.24
Tactical control is a technique developed by study and practice.

397
00:24:10.24 --> 00:24:12.48
Next accomplishment of the mission.

398
00:24:12.48 --> 00:24:17.88
The primary duty of the leader is the accomplishment of his assigned mission.

399
00:24:17.88 --> 00:24:22.76
Everything else, even the welfare of his men is subordinate.

400
00:24:22.76 --> 00:24:23.76
Okay?

401
00:24:23.76 --> 00:24:31.000
So here's where I will throw this out at you all day long, 1951 book.

402
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.76
I'm going to throw a Trump card on you.

403
00:24:33.76 --> 00:24:36.72
Okay, you have your mission.

404
00:24:36.72 --> 00:24:44.20
If you put the welfare of your men below your assigned mission, what happens on your next

405
00:24:44.20 --> 00:24:45.20
mission?

406
00:24:45.20 --> 00:24:48.000
I feel you don't have any men left.

407
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.44
You don't have any loyalty.

408
00:24:49.44 --> 00:24:51.44
You've sacrificed your guys.

409
00:24:51.44 --> 00:24:54.60
You're looking at you like you let him into a bloodbath.

410
00:24:54.60 --> 00:25:04.16
So you have to actually, this is the opening chapter of the dichotomy of leadership.

411
00:25:04.16 --> 00:25:08.72
It's called the ultimate dichotomy because this is the hardest thing to balance.

412
00:25:08.72 --> 00:25:12.20
Because yes, you do have to accomplish your mission, but yes, you do have to take care

413
00:25:12.20 --> 00:25:13.20
of your men.

414
00:25:13.20 --> 00:25:17.28
And I don't believe that the welfare of your men is subordinate to executing the mission.

415
00:25:17.28 --> 00:25:18.84
I don't believe that.

416
00:25:18.84 --> 00:25:23.60
Because if you do that one time, who's going to get just one mission?

417
00:25:23.60 --> 00:25:29.12
And by the way, if I order you to take your men and that's the one mission you get and

418
00:25:29.12 --> 00:25:33.60
it destroys all your men and you, what happens the next guy that I try and order to do

419
00:25:33.60 --> 00:25:34.60
that too?

420
00:25:34.60 --> 00:25:39.20
They're not going to be loyal to me because I already have shown that I don't care about

421
00:25:39.20 --> 00:25:41.40
the lives of the troops.

422
00:25:41.40 --> 00:25:49.84
Now are there times where a mission is so strategically critical that there will be great

423
00:25:49.84 --> 00:25:53.96
sacrifice, including this sacrifice of everyone involved?

424
00:25:53.96 --> 00:25:55.40
Yeah, that can happen.

425
00:25:55.40 --> 00:25:57.12
It doesn't happen very often.

426
00:25:57.12 --> 00:26:05.04
But like the Chernobyl disaster in Russia, the I think it was like the first 87 firefighters

427
00:26:05.04 --> 00:26:06.04
that were there.

428
00:26:06.04 --> 00:26:07.76
They just all fought the fire till they died.

429
00:26:07.76 --> 00:26:10.32
They just did their best and everyone of them knew they were going to die.

430
00:26:10.32 --> 00:26:13.84
And they just went in there and fought and did their best to control that situation.

431
00:26:13.84 --> 00:26:17.56
So whoever ordered him in there was like, yep, we're going in there and they all said, yep,

432
00:26:17.56 --> 00:26:19.44
we got to do the best we can.

433
00:26:19.44 --> 00:26:24.24
And then they just started bringing in military guys who would go in and shovel sand on the

434
00:26:24.24 --> 00:26:27.24
fire for two minutes and 20 seconds.

435
00:26:27.24 --> 00:26:32.84
And in that two minutes and 20 seconds, they got their lifetime dose of radiation.

436
00:26:32.84 --> 00:26:33.84
And then they were done.

437
00:26:33.84 --> 00:26:38.08
I'm throwing these out there like I'm no one, but it's something like that.

438
00:26:38.08 --> 00:26:40.28
That's what happened.

439
00:26:40.28 --> 00:26:44.16
So yes, you have to take care of your man.

440
00:26:44.16 --> 00:26:46.84
And if you don't take care of your man while you're trying to accomplish your mission,

441
00:26:46.84 --> 00:26:49.88
you're going to have an assituation where you don't have any men left or you don't have

442
00:26:49.88 --> 00:26:50.88
any loyalty.

443
00:26:50.88 --> 00:26:54.76
And it actually goes into that a little bit next year, duties to the men.

444
00:26:54.76 --> 00:27:00.08
The next responsibility of the leader lies with his duty to his men.

445
00:27:00.08 --> 00:27:04.36
It is rarely possible to accomplish any mission without attention to the morale and the

446
00:27:04.36 --> 00:27:12.48
history of the men in the military service, the follower is dependent upon his leader.

447
00:27:12.48 --> 00:27:17.96
He can do little to improve his lot if his leader, if his leader neglects him.

448
00:27:17.96 --> 00:27:19.64
So you got to take care of your people.

449
00:27:19.64 --> 00:27:21.000
That's the bottom line.

450
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:27.36
There are four characteristics of a command that are accurate indications of success or failure

451
00:27:27.36 --> 00:27:30.08
in the exercise of leadership.

452
00:27:30.08 --> 00:27:33.32
Number one.

453
00:27:33.32 --> 00:27:39.80
Military discipline is a state of order and obedience existing within a command.

454
00:27:39.80 --> 00:27:46.64
It involves the ready subordination of the will of the individual for the good of the group.

455
00:27:46.64 --> 00:27:52.000
Military discipline is an extension and a specialized application of the discipline of any

456
00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.32
organized society.

457
00:27:54.32 --> 00:27:56.20
Now pay attention.

458
00:27:56.20 --> 00:28:05.52
Who discipline demands habitual but reasoned obedience to command and obedience that preserves

459
00:28:05.52 --> 00:28:10.88
initiative and functions unfalteringly even in the absence of the commander.

460
00:28:10.88 --> 00:28:18.20
So even though this discipline is obey as about obedience, it's about reasoned obedience.

461
00:28:18.20 --> 00:28:20.44
It doesn't eliminate initiative.

462
00:28:20.44 --> 00:28:25.44
It doesn't take away your ability to think.

463
00:28:25.44 --> 00:28:28.08
That's the kind of discipline that is needed.

464
00:28:28.08 --> 00:28:32.68
Discipline is created within a command by training, by judicious use of punishment and

465
00:28:32.68 --> 00:28:37.88
reward and by instilling a sense of confidence and responsibility in each individual.

466
00:28:37.88 --> 00:28:40.44
Discipline demands correct performance of duty.

467
00:28:40.44 --> 00:28:47.44
The need for discipline is best inculcated in an individual by appealing to his sense of

468
00:28:47.44 --> 00:28:48.44
reason.

469
00:28:48.44 --> 00:28:53.44
In other words, making sure they understand why they're doing what they're doing.

470
00:28:53.44 --> 00:28:57.96
In a few instances where appeal to reason fails, the use of punishment is effective in

471
00:28:57.96 --> 00:29:05.08
causing the recalcitrant individual to conform and perhaps to appreciate the need for discipline.

472
00:29:05.08 --> 00:29:10.000
Commendation and earned praise from the senior to a subordinate either individually or collectively

473
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.16
for a task well done served as strength in the disciplinary bonds which bind together

474
00:29:15.16 --> 00:29:17.92
the smooth functioning team.

475
00:29:17.92 --> 00:29:19.24
So there you go.

476
00:29:19.24 --> 00:29:25.40
Number one, most important thing is good old discipline.

477
00:29:25.40 --> 00:29:27.12
Next thing, morale.

478
00:29:27.12 --> 00:29:28.96
Morales are mental and emotional state.

479
00:29:28.96 --> 00:29:33.64
The importance of morale cannot be overestimated since it is a great contributing factor

480
00:29:33.64 --> 00:29:35.32
to the efficiency of a unit.

481
00:29:35.32 --> 00:29:42.44
Good morale is an indicated by zeal or the voluntary effort which men give to their tasks

482
00:29:42.44 --> 00:29:49.32
over and beyond the perfunctory obedience to commands and regulations and a basic sense of personal

483
00:29:49.32 --> 00:29:55.20
worth founded on confidence in leaders, training, weapons and equipment and last a

484
00:29:55.20 --> 00:30:02.88
satisfaction or the pride of the individual in the accomplishment of the assigned mission.

485
00:30:02.88 --> 00:30:07.36
So that's important that even if you are able to bark orders at people and get them to

486
00:30:07.36 --> 00:30:10.80
do what you want to do, they're not going to do it with an e-seal.

487
00:30:10.80 --> 00:30:13.68
They're just going to do the bare minimum and the bare minimum is not going to be good

488
00:30:13.68 --> 00:30:16.88
enough in a combat situation.

489
00:30:16.88 --> 00:30:20.88
A spriticore is the mental and emotional state of the unit.

490
00:30:20.88 --> 00:30:25.56
It is distinguished from morale which is described as the mental and emotional state of the

491
00:30:25.56 --> 00:30:26.56
individual.

492
00:30:26.56 --> 00:30:32.28
A spriticore is not a simple summation of the morale of the individuals in the unit.

493
00:30:32.28 --> 00:30:38.84
Rather it results from the total interaction of the personnel of the unit toward one another

494
00:30:38.84 --> 00:30:44.32
and with the circumstances in which the unit is placed.

495
00:30:44.32 --> 00:30:52.000
So you get morale which is, hey, how we do individually and then you combine that together

496
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.92
and then it's the sum is greater than the parts.

497
00:30:56.92 --> 00:30:59.92
So you just don't add up the morale of the individuals.

498
00:30:59.92 --> 00:31:07.16
You take all that morale and then you put it through the calculus that is a little bit

499
00:31:07.16 --> 00:31:10.36
hard to quantify that results in a spriticore.

500
00:31:10.36 --> 00:31:14.36
When the unit is spriest high the collective goals of the unit overshadow those of the

501
00:31:14.36 --> 00:31:16.60
individual members.

502
00:31:16.60 --> 00:31:23.40
In such instances the personal dissatisfactions of some individuals are overshadowed by the

503
00:31:23.40 --> 00:31:25.44
prevailing group spirit.

504
00:31:25.44 --> 00:31:29.92
Unit achievement both past and present is a strong force in raising a spriticore.

505
00:31:29.92 --> 00:31:35.16
A unit with highest spriticore can accomplish its mission in spite of seemingly insurmountable

506
00:31:35.16 --> 00:31:36.16
odds.

507
00:31:36.16 --> 00:31:42.48
A spriticore is enhanced when the group identification is increased and conversely is lowered

508
00:31:42.48 --> 00:31:45.40
when it is decreased.

509
00:31:45.40 --> 00:31:50.24
It has been proved that pride in the unit was the outstanding manifestation of good morale

510
00:31:50.24 --> 00:31:51.72
in World War II.

511
00:31:51.72 --> 00:31:56.84
This was accomplished by good officer to enlisted personnel relationships.

512
00:31:56.84 --> 00:32:05.28
Now as much as everyone talks about how bad identity politics are, right?

513
00:32:05.28 --> 00:32:07.16
Because we don't want to identify with the group.

514
00:32:07.16 --> 00:32:08.92
We want to be identified as an individual.

515
00:32:08.92 --> 00:32:13.88
But when you're in a military unit you want to have some of that collective identity.

516
00:32:13.88 --> 00:32:21.80
You want to say, hey, we're the 101st airborne division and we are proud of that.

517
00:32:21.80 --> 00:32:29.16
Or hey, when I was at SEAL Team 1 as a young SEAL, it was like we were SEAL Team 1.

518
00:32:29.16 --> 00:32:37.32
Have ever told you our little underground motto?

519
00:32:37.32 --> 00:32:42.72
Team 1, it's not just a number, it's an attitude.

520
00:32:42.72 --> 00:32:46.28
Which is, and the reason I laugh is because that's just completely ridiculous, right?

521
00:32:46.28 --> 00:32:47.60
To even think that.

522
00:32:47.60 --> 00:32:53.24
But it was, you know, we kind of joked about that, but we kind of took it seriously, too.

523
00:32:53.24 --> 00:32:54.24
Oh, yeah.

524
00:32:54.24 --> 00:32:55.24
When you're inside?

525
00:32:55.24 --> 00:33:01.32
Yeah, big time. So that building that unit identity, and you see this all the time in all kinds of groups.

526
00:33:01.32 --> 00:33:02.32
It's just unfortunate.

527
00:33:02.32 --> 00:33:07.12
It's unfortunate when it goes over to the political realm.

528
00:33:07.12 --> 00:33:13.16
And when people start being the biggest, the best thing that they've got going for them is that I'm a white guy.

529
00:33:13.16 --> 00:33:16.80
For the best thing that I've got going for me is I'm a black dude.

530
00:33:16.80 --> 00:33:22.80
Like that's not what we, that's not the group, that's not the group identity you want to cherish.

531
00:33:22.80 --> 00:33:28.32
Oh, yeah, I mean, because especially when those are, and I'm not going to go in that direction, obviously,

532
00:33:28.32 --> 00:33:31.36
because we're talking about something else, but especially if,

533
00:33:31.36 --> 00:33:34.32
sounds like you're about to go inside or I'm a little bit said you are.

534
00:33:34.32 --> 00:33:38.96
But if you're part of a group involuntarily, you know, so, you know, like,

535
00:33:38.96 --> 00:33:47.96
the group's going to be less cohesive if you're like proclaiming that, hey, this is the group.

536
00:33:47.96 --> 00:33:49.56
And this is what we're functioning as.

537
00:33:49.56 --> 00:33:52.84
Like this is when we're functioning as a group because of this quality, you know,

538
00:33:52.84 --> 00:33:56.20
meanwhile, there's like people that have that quality that we're not part of that group.

539
00:33:56.20 --> 00:34:01.60
So it's not as cohesive as like, okay, we all are on team one because we all pursue this.

540
00:34:01.60 --> 00:34:03.24
So we're all in it.

541
00:34:03.24 --> 00:34:07.24
And then boom, yes, we can, we can have, you know, it's not just a number.

542
00:34:07.24 --> 00:34:08.36
It's an attitude.

543
00:34:08.36 --> 00:34:10.36
And then everyone's going to sign on.

544
00:34:10.36 --> 00:34:11.36
Everybody.

545
00:34:11.36 --> 00:34:12.76
Yeah, not everyone's side-on.

546
00:34:12.76 --> 00:34:14.76
Just, just sign on.

547
00:34:14.76 --> 00:34:18.76
There's a lot of guys that left he won because we had that attitude.

548
00:34:18.76 --> 00:34:20.56
They went down to team five.

549
00:34:20.56 --> 00:34:22.56
They were like, dude, it's awesome down there.

550
00:34:22.56 --> 00:34:24.56
A lot less stressful.

551
00:34:24.56 --> 00:34:29.000
The big thing like team one had no one had uniform inspections on the West Coast.

552
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.68
And team one, the first Tuesday of every month, you had a uniform inspection.

553
00:34:35.68 --> 00:34:41.76
And then the second Tuesday, the first and the second Tuesday or the first and the third Tuesday of every month,

554
00:34:41.76 --> 00:34:43.76
you had a haircut inspection.

555
00:34:43.76 --> 00:34:45.36
This is in the day.

556
00:34:45.36 --> 00:34:46.36
Who made that up?

557
00:34:46.36 --> 00:34:48.56
You made, I did not make up that rule.

558
00:34:48.56 --> 00:34:50.36
But that was the old school professional.

559
00:34:50.36 --> 00:34:55.56
That's why team one was like the other team's nicknamed team one.

560
00:34:55.56 --> 00:34:57.36
Stolog team one.

561
00:34:57.36 --> 00:34:58.56
Like it was a stolog.

562
00:34:58.56 --> 00:35:00.36
Like we were in prison camp.

563
00:35:00.36 --> 00:35:02.56
Because it was so strict.

564
00:35:02.56 --> 00:35:06.96
But quite frankly, that I took a lot of away from that.

565
00:35:06.96 --> 00:35:13.36
And I kind of always identified with that professionalism that was a good thing,

566
00:35:13.36 --> 00:35:15.76
especially when viewed from the outside.

567
00:35:15.76 --> 00:35:22.16
So there was a little bit of a fascist, I guess, lineage, right?

568
00:35:22.16 --> 00:35:27.56
When you hear Jordan Peterson talk about like, orderly, missing all that stuff, well, team one was all about that kind of thing.

569
00:35:27.56 --> 00:35:29.56
So they're a little bit more fascist.

570
00:35:29.56 --> 00:35:35.76
Whereas team five, for instance, were Jason Gardner was, they were kind of loose.

571
00:35:35.76 --> 00:35:38.16
They were a little bit out there.

572
00:35:38.16 --> 00:35:39.56
Is that the time you had blonde hair?

573
00:35:39.56 --> 00:35:40.56
Yeah, yeah.

574
00:35:40.56 --> 00:35:43.56
That's when Jason Gardner had bleached blonde hair.

575
00:35:43.56 --> 00:35:46.96
But you know, we all, I mean, I had long hair at the time and long sideburns and stuff.

576
00:35:46.96 --> 00:35:49.36
I thought I was lemme from motorhead and things like that.

577
00:35:49.36 --> 00:35:51.16
Yeah, yeah, probably were.

578
00:35:51.16 --> 00:35:57.16
So group identity, unit identity, so important.

579
00:35:57.16 --> 00:36:04.96
The guys that we work with over and I rack in Ramadi, those guys had their, their battle streamers that they,

580
00:36:04.96 --> 00:36:06.96
a near tactical operation center.

581
00:36:06.96 --> 00:36:11.36
They had pictures of pictures of World War II newspaper clippings.

582
00:36:11.36 --> 00:36:12.96
They brought them on deployment.

583
00:36:12.96 --> 00:36:16.56
To hang up in their tactical operations center, to hang up in their chow halls.

584
00:36:16.56 --> 00:36:21.96
So when you walked in and out, if you were a, if you were a soldier from the first

585
00:36:21.96 --> 00:36:25.76
to the 506 or you were a soldier from the 137, you would see that stuff.

586
00:36:25.76 --> 00:36:28.36
You would realize you would get that group identity.

587
00:36:28.36 --> 00:36:30.36
You'd feel that is predacor.

588
00:36:30.36 --> 00:36:34.36
And that's a pretty powerful tool.

589
00:36:34.36 --> 00:36:40.96
Last one, efficiency is the ability to accomplish successfully in a sign task in a shortest possible

590
00:36:40.96 --> 00:36:45.76
time with the minimum expenditure of means and with the least possible confusion, efficiency

591
00:36:45.76 --> 00:36:50.96
in a command is built by sound training and by effective administration.

592
00:36:50.96 --> 00:36:56.16
It is enhanced by good discipline, high morale and a spirit of core.

593
00:36:56.16 --> 00:37:01.36
I like that one because it reminded me of the whole show we did on judo and just talking

594
00:37:01.36 --> 00:37:05.56
about the importance of efficiency.

595
00:37:05.56 --> 00:37:07.36
Moving on to some psychology.

596
00:37:07.36 --> 00:37:11.76
Leadership is closely linked with psychology, the study of human behavior, proved principles

597
00:37:11.76 --> 00:37:15.04
of leadership include proved principles of psychology.

598
00:37:15.04 --> 00:37:21.48
It is known that human beings tend to react similarly under a given set of conditions.

599
00:37:21.48 --> 00:37:26.48
From a leadership standpoint, some of these reactions are favorable, some unfavorable, with

600
00:37:26.48 --> 00:37:31.24
a knowledge of how human beings tend to respond to a particular set of circumstances and with

601
00:37:31.24 --> 00:37:36.60
a comprehension of the basic factors that control human behavior, the leader can capitalize

602
00:37:36.60 --> 00:37:42.60
on favorable reactions and minimize tendencies toward unfavorable ones.

603
00:37:42.60 --> 00:37:49.64
It is evident therefore that a knowledge of psychology is helpful to the leader.

604
00:37:49.64 --> 00:37:53.72
That's something that I have more recently been saying because I just thought it was human

605
00:37:53.72 --> 00:37:59.16
nature but now I'm certain realize that human nature and psychology is one big bowl of

606
00:37:59.16 --> 00:38:04.24
stuff that's all related.

607
00:38:04.24 --> 00:38:09.36
The science of moral duty is closely allied with the art of leadership in order to set

608
00:38:09.36 --> 00:38:13.76
the example for his men and to win their confidence and respect the leader must be capable

609
00:38:13.76 --> 00:38:20.76
of deciding whether a given course of action is morally right or wrong.

610
00:38:20.76 --> 00:38:28.24
Temporizing with principles and moral standards may secure a temporary advantage or fleeting

611
00:38:28.24 --> 00:38:29.24
popularity.

612
00:38:29.24 --> 00:38:36.48
So if you adapt your morals a little bit from time to time, if you hesitate to really

613
00:38:36.48 --> 00:38:44.000
impose your actual beliefs on something, you can get a little popular for a moment.

614
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.44
But in the end, only stricted here is to high standards of honor and integrity will

615
00:38:48.44 --> 00:38:53.12
prove a value to the leader.

616
00:38:53.12 --> 00:38:55.96
So important.

617
00:38:55.96 --> 00:38:58.96
Alright, now we get kind of into the meat.

618
00:38:58.96 --> 00:39:02.24
We'll call it the meat of this discussion.

619
00:39:02.24 --> 00:39:05.56
Principles of military leadership.

620
00:39:05.56 --> 00:39:10.64
The principles of military leadership discussed below are equally applicable to all levels

621
00:39:10.64 --> 00:39:15.60
of command from the squad to the army group.

622
00:39:15.60 --> 00:39:19.32
Principle one, no-your-job.

623
00:39:19.32 --> 00:39:24.92
To know his job thoroughly the leader must possess a wide field of knowledge he must understand

624
00:39:24.92 --> 00:39:29.12
the technical aspects of the operation of his command and the methods and procedures of

625
00:39:29.12 --> 00:39:32.68
organization, administration, instruction and personnel management.

626
00:39:32.68 --> 00:39:36.52
The leader should also possess a sound understanding of human relations.

627
00:39:36.52 --> 00:39:39.92
Further, he should have a working knowledge of the duties responsibilities and problems

628
00:39:39.92 --> 00:39:41.40
of his subordinates.

629
00:39:41.40 --> 00:39:46.04
If he commands a service unit, he should have knowledge of combat operations.

630
00:39:46.04 --> 00:39:47.04
So there you go.

631
00:39:47.04 --> 00:39:51.60
Principle one, no-your-job.

632
00:39:51.60 --> 00:39:56.16
Rule two, no-yourself and seek improvement.

633
00:39:56.16 --> 00:40:02.72
It is the duty of every leader to evaluate himself and to recognize his strength and weaknesses.

634
00:40:02.72 --> 00:40:08.000
An individual who does not know his own capabilities and limitations is not master of himself

635
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.88
and can never hope to be a leader.

636
00:40:10.88 --> 00:40:15.88
Likewise an individual who realizes his deficiencies but makes no effort to correct them

637
00:40:15.88 --> 00:40:18.24
will fail as a leader.

638
00:40:18.24 --> 00:40:23.12
The study of leadership principles and practice of sound leadership techniques will develop

639
00:40:23.12 --> 00:40:27.28
leadership ability.

640
00:40:27.28 --> 00:40:35.52
So know yourself and seek improvement as principle number two, go all the way back to Sunsu,

641
00:40:35.52 --> 00:40:37.88
know yourself.

642
00:40:37.88 --> 00:40:44.84
Principle three, no-your-men and look out for their welfare by making a conscientious effort

643
00:40:44.84 --> 00:40:50.32
to observe the members of his command as often as possible to become personally acquainted

644
00:40:50.32 --> 00:40:55.40
with them to recognize their individual differences and to share in their joys and sorrows.

645
00:40:55.40 --> 00:41:00.24
The leader will have a better understanding of how his subordinates react and function under

646
00:41:00.24 --> 00:41:01.24
various conditions.

647
00:41:01.24 --> 00:41:06.56
You will then be able to employ them more effectively by assuring himself that the members

648
00:41:06.56 --> 00:41:12.04
of his command are as comfortable well cared for and contented as circumstances will permit.

649
00:41:12.04 --> 00:41:17.40
The leader wins their confidence, respect and cooperation by neglecting their welfare,

650
00:41:17.40 --> 00:41:23.32
the leader indicates indifference and as a consequence for fits the trust and confidence

651
00:41:23.32 --> 00:41:26.36
of his men.

652
00:41:26.36 --> 00:41:33.72
So principle number three is know your men and look out for their welfare, which is interesting

653
00:41:33.72 --> 00:41:40.44
because they said the mission was more important but what they're saying is take area

654
00:41:40.44 --> 00:41:43.12
men.

655
00:41:43.12 --> 00:41:48.20
Principle four, keep your men informed.

656
00:41:48.20 --> 00:41:51.84
The soldier who is well informed about the mission and situation and about the purpose

657
00:41:51.84 --> 00:41:57.28
of his particular task is considerably more effective than one who is not so informed.

658
00:41:57.28 --> 00:42:01.88
The better he is informed, the better he can perform his task with maximum initiative.

659
00:42:01.88 --> 00:42:06.64
The commander who fails to make essential information available to his men will soon find

660
00:42:06.64 --> 00:42:11.52
out that they are performing blindly without purpose.

661
00:42:11.52 --> 00:42:15.76
At the same time commanders at all levels must realize that security requirements imposed

662
00:42:15.76 --> 00:42:22.24
limitations on information which may be imparted to them that keep your men informed.

663
00:42:22.24 --> 00:42:28.04
The lesson that I learned in the back of a long, sealed patrol, no one telling me what

664
00:42:28.04 --> 00:42:29.04
was going on.

665
00:42:29.04 --> 00:42:32.64
None of us in the back know have any idea where we are, where we're going, when we're

666
00:42:32.64 --> 00:42:33.64
going to stop.

667
00:42:33.64 --> 00:42:37.52
So, nightmare, keep your men informed.

668
00:42:37.52 --> 00:42:42.44
Principle five, set the example, men instinctively look to their leaders for patterns

669
00:42:42.44 --> 00:42:47.88
of conduct which they may either emulate or use an excuse for their own shortcomings.

670
00:42:47.88 --> 00:42:50.64
They're always watching you.

671
00:42:50.64 --> 00:42:55.96
The classic example of the military leader that is that is that of an individual who's

672
00:42:55.96 --> 00:43:01.04
appearance in conduct of vote from his subordinates praise, pride, and the desire to emulate

673
00:43:01.04 --> 00:43:02.04
him.

674
00:43:02.04 --> 00:43:06.60
By his outstanding performance of duty, the leader must set the standard for the entire

675
00:43:06.60 --> 00:43:08.36
command.

676
00:43:08.36 --> 00:43:13.88
The commander who appears in an unfavorable light before his men destroys the respect

677
00:43:13.88 --> 00:43:20.08
that must exist, exist mutually between him and his men before leadership can be exercised.

678
00:43:20.08 --> 00:43:25.76
So, don't look like a loser.

679
00:43:25.76 --> 00:43:31.28
Principle six, ensure that the task is understood supervising accomplished.

680
00:43:31.28 --> 00:43:33.52
So, now we're getting into the mission, right?

681
00:43:33.52 --> 00:43:37.28
Number six, number three was take care of your people.

682
00:43:37.28 --> 00:43:41.12
The leader must give clear concise orders.

683
00:43:41.12 --> 00:43:45.84
That cannot be misunderstood, which is I always say simple clear concise.

684
00:43:45.84 --> 00:43:49.92
I guess I rip them off.

685
00:43:49.92 --> 00:43:54.40
Then by close supervision, he must ensure that those orders are properly executed.

686
00:43:54.40 --> 00:43:58.56
The issuance of an order is the initial and relatively small part of the commander's

687
00:43:58.56 --> 00:44:03.24
responsibility, his principal responsibility lies in supervision to make sure that the

688
00:44:03.24 --> 00:44:06.12
order is properly executed.

689
00:44:06.12 --> 00:44:09.92
It is this responsibility that is most difficult to carry out.

690
00:44:09.92 --> 00:44:15.68
The able leader will make wise use of his subordinates to carry out his supervision effectively.

691
00:44:15.68 --> 00:44:19.24
Any commander of a large unit who fails to make proper and adequate use of his staff and

692
00:44:19.24 --> 00:44:25.60
subordinates demonstrates a fundamental weakness in his leadership capability, which the

693
00:44:25.60 --> 00:44:28.24
weakness is he's not utilizing decentralized command.

694
00:44:28.24 --> 00:44:36.72
And for this one, this is a little, I think what we have to pay attention to is you give

695
00:44:36.72 --> 00:44:39.48
the task and then you supervise it and you make sure it's accomplished.

696
00:44:39.48 --> 00:44:42.28
But you have to be careful that you're not giving the task and then micromanaging it

697
00:44:42.28 --> 00:44:45.32
because then you're going to lose track because you can't micromanage everything that's

698
00:44:45.32 --> 00:44:47.20
going on.

699
00:44:47.20 --> 00:44:53.36
So you have to supervise, you have to check back in, but you can't micromanage.

700
00:44:53.36 --> 00:44:57.04
Principle seven, train your men as a team.

701
00:44:57.04 --> 00:45:02.92
The duty of every leader includes the development of teamwork through and thorough through

702
00:45:02.92 --> 00:45:08.12
the thorough training of his command, whether it be squad or an army group.

703
00:45:08.12 --> 00:45:13.80
Modern armies are complex organizations involving many different arms and services all working

704
00:45:13.80 --> 00:45:17.28
together as a team toward a common end.

705
00:45:17.28 --> 00:45:21.12
Each part of the team must understand where it fits into the common effort.

706
00:45:21.12 --> 00:45:26.64
The commander who fails to foster teamwork while training his command will not obtain the

707
00:45:26.64 --> 00:45:29.24
desired degree of unit efficiency.

708
00:45:29.24 --> 00:45:35.92
So principle number seven, train your men as a team.

709
00:45:35.92 --> 00:45:42.12
Principle eight, make sound and timely decisions.

710
00:45:42.12 --> 00:45:47.60
The ability to make a rapid estimate of the situation and a rye of the sound decision is

711
00:45:47.60 --> 00:45:50.08
essential to a leader.

712
00:45:50.08 --> 00:45:54.16
He must be able to reason logically under the most trying conditions.

713
00:45:54.16 --> 00:45:58.68
He must decide quickly what action is necessary in order to take advantage of the opportunities

714
00:45:58.68 --> 00:46:00.68
as they occur.

715
00:46:00.68 --> 00:46:06.20
The vacillating commander not only will be unable to employ his command effectively, but

716
00:46:06.20 --> 00:46:13.88
will create vacillation, lack of confidence, hesitation and indecision within the command itself.

717
00:46:13.88 --> 00:46:18.88
The ability to make sound and timely decisions can be acquired by constant study and

718
00:46:18.88 --> 00:46:21.20
by training in making estimates.

719
00:46:21.20 --> 00:46:27.84
On the other hand, when circumstances dictate a change in plan, the able leader will act

720
00:46:27.84 --> 00:46:33.36
promptly without fear that the command may consider such action as a vacillation.

721
00:46:33.36 --> 00:46:35.16
So yeah, you got to make good decisions.

722
00:46:35.16 --> 00:46:38.60
And then if you make a bad decision, you just say, hey, that was wrong.

723
00:46:38.60 --> 00:46:40.72
We're moving to this other direction now.

724
00:46:40.72 --> 00:46:44.92
My bust, let's roll.

725
00:46:44.92 --> 00:46:51.96
Well, nine, seek responsibility and develop a sense of responsibility among subordinates.

726
00:46:51.96 --> 00:46:54.32
This is about ownership.

727
00:46:54.32 --> 00:46:58.88
The leader must be quick to seize initiative in the absence of instructions from his

728
00:46:58.88 --> 00:47:00.44
superior.

729
00:47:00.44 --> 00:47:04.68
By seeking responsibility, the leader develops himself professionally and increases his potential

730
00:47:04.68 --> 00:47:05.68
ability.

731
00:47:05.68 --> 00:47:10.68
Proper delegation of authority is a sound attribute of leadership.

732
00:47:10.68 --> 00:47:15.32
The commander then holds his subordinate strictly responsible for the results and rarely

733
00:47:15.32 --> 00:47:17.40
the methods of procedure.

734
00:47:17.40 --> 00:47:21.08
So what he's saying, there's a do tell people what to do, not how to do it.

735
00:47:21.08 --> 00:47:24.68
You let them figure out the methods of procedure.

736
00:47:24.68 --> 00:47:28.44
Such action by the commander in genders, trust, faith and confidence.

737
00:47:28.44 --> 00:47:31.80
So when I give someone a mission and I don't tell them specifically, every little detail

738
00:47:31.80 --> 00:47:34.48
of how I want to done, there's a letter we're on with it.

739
00:47:34.48 --> 00:47:38.28
That means they know, I trust them and that develops, trust back in my direction for

740
00:47:38.28 --> 00:47:40.28
me.

741
00:47:40.28 --> 00:47:46.84
If it develops initiative and whole-hearted cooperation, reluctance to delegate authority

742
00:47:46.84 --> 00:47:51.72
often is the mark of retarded growth in leadership.

743
00:47:51.72 --> 00:47:54.52
So seek responsibility.

744
00:47:54.52 --> 00:47:56.20
But more important.

745
00:47:56.20 --> 00:47:57.52
Give that responsibility.

746
00:47:57.52 --> 00:48:00.84
Give that ownership down the chain of command.

747
00:48:00.84 --> 00:48:02.44
Principal 10.

748
00:48:02.44 --> 00:48:06.56
Employ your command in accordance with its capabilities.

749
00:48:06.56 --> 00:48:10.40
You employ his command properly and leader must have a thorough knowledge of the tactical

750
00:48:10.40 --> 00:48:13.68
administrative capabilities and limitations of his command.

751
00:48:13.68 --> 00:48:18.92
He must assign objectives that are possible of attainment.

752
00:48:18.92 --> 00:48:19.92
That's a good one.

753
00:48:19.92 --> 00:48:24.36
Sometimes I see business leaders, they're all fired up and they throw things at their

754
00:48:24.36 --> 00:48:27.60
teams that are not achievable.

755
00:48:27.60 --> 00:48:29.08
And I'll say, well, do you think they can really pull it up?

756
00:48:29.08 --> 00:48:32.76
Well, I don't know if you don't want to give them that good stretch goal.

757
00:48:32.76 --> 00:48:36.44
And meanwhile, no one thinks they can even hit the goal, so they don't even try.

758
00:48:36.44 --> 00:48:38.44
You know, you can see this all day with kids.

759
00:48:38.44 --> 00:48:43.28
If you give them something that they figure out that they can't achieve and all

760
00:48:43.28 --> 00:48:44.28
they'll just stop trying.

761
00:48:44.28 --> 00:48:45.68
And it's the same thing with adults.

762
00:48:45.68 --> 00:48:46.68
It's human nature.

763
00:48:46.68 --> 00:48:50.88
It's what it's called the stretch goal.

764
00:48:50.88 --> 00:48:52.28
Yeah, that's what it's called.

765
00:48:52.28 --> 00:48:56.96
Sales people and other people do, but sales groups at companies, they'll call them

766
00:48:56.96 --> 00:48:57.96
the stretch goal.

767
00:48:57.96 --> 00:48:58.96
We got our stretch goal.

768
00:48:58.96 --> 00:48:59.96
Got you.

769
00:48:59.96 --> 00:49:00.96
Yeah, we got our stretch goal.

770
00:49:00.96 --> 00:49:04.16
We're going to sell $80 billion in the next four weeks.

771
00:49:04.16 --> 00:49:10.28
And the teams like, that means we're doing to do 400 times what we've ever done in a

772
00:49:10.28 --> 00:49:11.28
full year.

773
00:49:11.28 --> 00:49:12.28
We're going to do that in two weeks.

774
00:49:12.28 --> 00:49:13.28
That's not realistic.

775
00:49:13.28 --> 00:49:14.28
I'm just going to do what I normally do.

776
00:49:14.28 --> 00:49:14.28
Yeah.

777
00:49:14.28 --> 00:49:25.04
To do less than this, may spell failure in accomplishing the mission.

778
00:49:25.04 --> 00:49:29.52
Recurrent failure brings about collapse of morale, a speed of core, and efficiency.

779
00:49:29.52 --> 00:49:30.52
So that's another thing.

780
00:49:30.52 --> 00:49:33.64
When you give these goals that are unattainable and you do it repeatedly, people start

781
00:49:33.64 --> 00:49:35.68
thinking, we're not even good enough.

782
00:49:35.68 --> 00:49:36.96
It starts to hurt morale.

783
00:49:36.96 --> 00:49:40.36
However, on occasion when the situation demands men must be pushed without hesitation

784
00:49:40.36 --> 00:49:44.48
beyond their considered capabilities in order to achieve a quick and cheap victory or

785
00:49:44.48 --> 00:49:46.40
to avoid a costly defeat.

786
00:49:46.40 --> 00:49:51.32
So yeah, sometimes you got to dig in.

787
00:49:51.32 --> 00:49:58.28
And the last principle, principle 11, this is going to come as a big surprise.

788
00:49:58.28 --> 00:50:01.48
Take responsibility for your actions.

789
00:50:01.48 --> 00:50:10.12
The commander of a unit is responsible for all his unit does or fails to do.

790
00:50:10.12 --> 00:50:12.76
They didn't know about extreme ownership back in 1951.

791
00:50:12.76 --> 00:50:13.76
But I'm sorry.

792
00:50:13.76 --> 00:50:14.76
They did.

793
00:50:14.76 --> 00:50:17.76
Yeah, I guess they called it something else.

794
00:50:17.76 --> 00:50:19.92
They didn't come up with this good of a name.

795
00:50:19.92 --> 00:50:22.32
They jumped him with the name.

796
00:50:22.32 --> 00:50:28.64
The leader recognizes and acknowledges this responsibility on all occasions.

797
00:50:28.64 --> 00:50:33.92
Any effort to evade this responsibility destroys the bond of loyalty and respect that

798
00:50:33.92 --> 00:50:36.92
must exist between the commander and his subordinates.

799
00:50:36.92 --> 00:50:43.64
Take responsibility, take extreme ownership for your actions.

800
00:50:43.64 --> 00:50:49.20
Everything the unit does or fails to do, you own it all.

801
00:50:49.20 --> 00:50:50.20
All right.

802
00:50:50.20 --> 00:50:52.76
So there's your 11 principles of leadership.

803
00:50:52.76 --> 00:50:56.40
Now it gets into some leadership traits.

804
00:50:56.40 --> 00:50:59.68
Leadership traits are human qualities that are of great value to the leader.

805
00:50:59.68 --> 00:51:04.44
Possession of these leadership traits simplifies the task of applying leadership principles

806
00:51:04.44 --> 00:51:10.68
and assists greatly in winning confidence, respect and cooperation.

807
00:51:10.68 --> 00:51:15.52
An individual can benefit by studying the traits considered important to the leader.

808
00:51:15.52 --> 00:51:22.48
By careful self analysis and application, he can develop those traits in which he is

809
00:51:22.48 --> 00:51:26.96
deficient and further strengthened the ones in which he is strong.

810
00:51:26.96 --> 00:51:28.20
So you've got to look yourself.

811
00:51:28.20 --> 00:51:31.04
You've got to see which one of these traits are good, which one are bad, which one

812
00:51:31.04 --> 00:51:35.92
are you good at, which one are you weak at, you need to figure those out.

813
00:51:35.92 --> 00:51:41.000
A study of our nation's great military leaders reveals that none possessed all the leadership

814
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.84
traits to the maximum degree.

815
00:51:43.84 --> 00:51:49.28
But that a weakness in some traits was more than compensated for by strength in others.

816
00:51:49.28 --> 00:51:54.88
A critical self analysis will enable an individual to realize the traits in which he is

817
00:51:54.88 --> 00:51:57.36
strong and to capitalize upon them.

818
00:51:57.36 --> 00:52:03.000
At the same time, he must endeavor to improve those traits in which he is weak.

819
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.80
The following is a list of traits.

820
00:52:04.80 --> 00:52:09.68
The following list of traits is by no means all inclusive, but does contain those of paramount

821
00:52:09.68 --> 00:52:11.92
importance to the leader.

822
00:52:11.92 --> 00:52:17.88
So this is a great list of traits.

823
00:52:17.88 --> 00:52:23.28
Solaris, vigilance, propness and wideawakness.

824
00:52:23.28 --> 00:52:24.56
So you've got to be a leader.

825
00:52:24.56 --> 00:52:27.12
You've got to be in the game.

826
00:52:27.12 --> 00:52:29.84
You've ever seen a leader that's not quite in the game.

827
00:52:29.84 --> 00:52:31.60
It's just not good, right?

828
00:52:31.60 --> 00:52:32.60
No.

829
00:52:32.60 --> 00:52:33.60
You've got to be in the game.

830
00:52:33.60 --> 00:52:38.68
If you're tired, if you're napping, you know, if you're sleeping, if you need a rest, if

831
00:52:38.68 --> 00:52:41.56
you're daydreaming, you know what I mean?

832
00:52:41.56 --> 00:52:46.20
You know what's funny is, you know, I have that tendency sometimes if people are talking

833
00:52:46.20 --> 00:52:51.28
to me and I'm not interested in what they're saying and I know you complain about this.

834
00:52:51.28 --> 00:52:56.28
Well, being complaints about this, life has made some comments about this.

835
00:52:56.28 --> 00:52:57.28
Sure.

836
00:52:57.28 --> 00:53:00.08
Like if you're not saying to everybody, I can't everybody.

837
00:53:00.08 --> 00:53:04.72
So, but when I do that, people don't think I'm not alert, right?

838
00:53:04.72 --> 00:53:07.84
They think like he's just like, he's alert on something else.

839
00:53:07.84 --> 00:53:08.84
Yeah, he checked out.

840
00:53:08.84 --> 00:53:09.84
Yeah, this particular.

841
00:53:09.84 --> 00:53:15.84
Yeah, this joku does not care about what I'm saying right now.

842
00:53:15.84 --> 00:53:19.04
So, but it is rude and it is a weakness of mine.

843
00:53:19.04 --> 00:53:20.68
Well, it's a weakness of mine.

844
00:53:20.68 --> 00:53:21.68
For sure.

845
00:53:21.68 --> 00:53:23.32
So, do you do it on purpose?

846
00:53:23.32 --> 00:53:24.32
No, I don't know.

847
00:53:24.32 --> 00:53:25.80
I don't think it's rude then.

848
00:53:25.80 --> 00:53:27.32
That's just how it's rude.

849
00:53:27.32 --> 00:53:28.68
It's rude for sure.

850
00:53:28.68 --> 00:53:30.40
It's rude for sure.

851
00:53:30.40 --> 00:53:31.40
It's rude for sure.

852
00:53:31.40 --> 00:53:35.000
I know that it makes, I know that it's not a good thing to do.

853
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.72
I know that and I don't mean to do it.

854
00:53:37.72 --> 00:53:38.72
I think it's better.

855
00:53:38.72 --> 00:53:39.72
I think it's better.

856
00:53:39.72 --> 00:53:40.72
Well, then it can't.

857
00:53:40.72 --> 00:53:43.04
Yeah, obviously it's better that I'm not intentionally doing it.

858
00:53:43.04 --> 00:53:45.08
It's not like you're in mid-sentence.

859
00:53:45.08 --> 00:53:46.64
Yeah, I just go, you know what?

860
00:53:46.64 --> 00:53:49.44
I just show you the palm and walk away, right?

861
00:53:49.44 --> 00:53:50.68
I have to do that.

862
00:53:50.68 --> 00:53:51.68
Yeah.

863
00:53:51.68 --> 00:53:54.28
I just, you'll like, someone will be talking to me and I'll be thinking about something

864
00:53:54.28 --> 00:53:55.68
that I need to be thinking about.

865
00:53:55.68 --> 00:54:00.16
And all of a sudden, maybe I'll turn or I'll walk or whatever.

866
00:54:00.16 --> 00:54:02.52
And yeah, that's disrespectful, man.

867
00:54:02.52 --> 00:54:03.52
I shouldn't do that.

868
00:54:03.52 --> 00:54:04.52
That's one of my weaknesses.

869
00:54:04.52 --> 00:54:11.12
But on the other hand, what if I'm going off on some thing?

870
00:54:11.12 --> 00:54:12.12
You know?

871
00:54:12.12 --> 00:54:13.12
It's possible.

872
00:54:13.12 --> 00:54:14.12
Yeah, yeah, no, this is possible.

873
00:54:14.12 --> 00:54:15.12
It's possible.

874
00:54:15.12 --> 00:54:16.12
It's possible.

875
00:54:16.12 --> 00:54:17.12
You are correct.

876
00:54:17.12 --> 00:54:19.12
So that is a possibility.

877
00:54:19.12 --> 00:54:21.12
Yeah, so I guess it's like, it's a spectrum.

878
00:54:21.12 --> 00:54:25.16
I mean, you're way on this side of the spectrum where you don't need to go off on something.

879
00:54:25.16 --> 00:54:27.52
And you know, and you'll still sort of do that sometimes.

880
00:54:27.52 --> 00:54:29.56
But I still write, right?

881
00:54:29.56 --> 00:54:31.56
But it still is not a good thing.

882
00:54:31.56 --> 00:54:33.84
It'd be better for me to say like, hey, man, you know what?

883
00:54:33.84 --> 00:54:35.84
Can you tell me about this later?

884
00:54:35.84 --> 00:54:37.84
Like when I'm 60?

885
00:54:37.84 --> 00:54:40.04
Because I don't care about it right now.

886
00:54:40.04 --> 00:54:42.44
I'm not going to care about it for another 15 years.

887
00:54:42.44 --> 00:54:43.44
Oh, whatever.

888
00:54:43.44 --> 00:54:46.04
Okay, so alertness.

889
00:54:46.04 --> 00:54:48.48
Next one is bearing.

890
00:54:48.48 --> 00:54:53.16
Baring denotes desirable, physical appearance, dress and department.

891
00:54:53.16 --> 00:54:54.16
This is important.

892
00:54:54.16 --> 00:54:55.88
Oh, like, how you present it?

893
00:54:55.88 --> 00:54:56.88
How you present it?

894
00:54:56.88 --> 00:54:57.88
What's your bearing?

895
00:54:57.88 --> 00:54:59.12
Are you slouched over?

896
00:54:59.12 --> 00:55:00.12
I went and worked.

897
00:55:00.12 --> 00:55:03.96
I went and talked to some under-privileged kids.

898
00:55:03.96 --> 00:55:10.36
And these under-privileged kids weren't, I would say, the type of kids, they were under-privileged

899
00:55:10.36 --> 00:55:16.44
kids who were really smart and in a bad situation.

900
00:55:16.44 --> 00:55:23.52
Not under-privileged kids who were not quite as smart and kind of just making their way

901
00:55:23.52 --> 00:55:25.88
in that under-privileged world.

902
00:55:25.88 --> 00:55:28.36
These kids were getting beat down by their world.

903
00:55:28.36 --> 00:55:32.24
And I went there and talked to them and I was going to talk about humility, right?

904
00:55:32.24 --> 00:55:37.80
And as I kind of got towards the humility part, I said to myself, I don't need to talk

905
00:55:37.80 --> 00:55:38.80
to these people.

906
00:55:38.80 --> 00:55:39.80
These kids about humility at all.

907
00:55:39.80 --> 00:55:41.12
These kids are overly humble.

908
00:55:41.12 --> 00:55:42.12
These kids are beat down.

909
00:55:42.12 --> 00:55:43.12
These kids need confidence.

910
00:55:43.12 --> 00:55:44.12
Right?

911
00:55:44.12 --> 00:55:46.12
And what they needed was they needed to bury.

912
00:55:46.12 --> 00:55:47.72
They needed to stand up straight.

913
00:55:47.72 --> 00:55:48.72
Right?

914
00:55:48.72 --> 00:55:49.72
That's what they needed.

915
00:55:49.72 --> 00:55:51.96
They needed to sit in their chairs or they asked a question, I started making them

916
00:55:51.96 --> 00:55:55.40
hey, when you asked me a question, stand up and ask a question.

917
00:55:55.40 --> 00:55:57.08
That wasn't being a jerk, but I was like, hey, we stand up.

918
00:55:57.08 --> 00:56:01.60
You know, let everyone see you because they're just their confidence was broken by life.

919
00:56:01.60 --> 00:56:04.48
And so you're bearing is important.

920
00:56:04.48 --> 00:56:09.44
And when someone comes and presents to you and they don't seem, they seem broken.

921
00:56:09.44 --> 00:56:10.44
They seem uncomfortable.

922
00:56:10.44 --> 00:56:13.12
Yeah, you're bearing is really important.

923
00:56:13.12 --> 00:56:15.68
So that means it's looking square the way.

924
00:56:15.68 --> 00:56:19.000
That means showing, you know, that's why to you, bruiser, everyone dressed in the proper

925
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000
uniform.

926
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.92
Everyone had a shaved head, everyone had, you know, everyone did the right things.

927
00:56:24.92 --> 00:56:27.88
So that way when we went and talked to the army and the Marine Corps, they didn't think

928
00:56:27.88 --> 00:56:30.72
these guys are idiots.

929
00:56:30.72 --> 00:56:31.72
Yeah.

930
00:56:31.72 --> 00:56:38.08
Next courage must be both physical and moral.

931
00:56:38.08 --> 00:56:40.08
No real expansion needed on that one.

932
00:56:40.08 --> 00:56:43.96
Decisiveness, the ability to make decisions promptly and when indicated and announce them

933
00:56:43.96 --> 00:56:51.04
a fortetively, concisely and clearly.

934
00:56:51.04 --> 00:56:56.60
Dependability is the doing of one's duty without supervision.

935
00:56:56.60 --> 00:57:01.52
Endurance, both mental and physical is necessary to continue and complete any reasonable

936
00:57:01.52 --> 00:57:03.76
task.

937
00:57:03.76 --> 00:57:09.28
The enthusiasm is positive, is the positive zeal or interest in the task at hand.

938
00:57:09.28 --> 00:57:11.92
It is easily communicated to subordinates.

939
00:57:11.92 --> 00:57:17.32
You know, that's one thing that's so good in the military is you get to see examples

940
00:57:17.32 --> 00:57:20.64
of when people are enthusiastic about a job.

941
00:57:20.64 --> 00:57:22.76
It just changes everything.

942
00:57:22.76 --> 00:57:27.40
When you have people that are not enthusiastic and really all you need is one or two

943
00:57:27.40 --> 00:57:29.68
people that are having a good time.

944
00:57:29.68 --> 00:57:32.08
And in a silp tomb, you pretty much always have that.

945
00:57:32.08 --> 00:57:36.000
You always have at least someone that's just going to bring it.

946
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000
Ready to go.

947
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Ready to go.

948
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.88
And if it's not you today, maybe it's you know, Bill, which apparently Bill's

949
00:57:41.88 --> 00:57:44.000
been getting a lot of flack of it recently.

950
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.24
So we'll give Bill some credit.

951
00:57:46.24 --> 00:57:51.76
Bill's Bill has a good day and Bill goes to make it happen and everyone sees the bills

952
00:57:51.76 --> 00:57:53.68
crushing it and you're like, you know what?

953
00:57:53.68 --> 00:57:55.68
Let's do this.

954
00:57:55.68 --> 00:58:02.000
Force is the ability to impose one's will upon another.

955
00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.60
Now this is an interesting one, right?

956
00:58:03.60 --> 00:58:05.28
It's an interesting one.

957
00:58:05.28 --> 00:58:08.72
The ability to impose one's will upon another.

958
00:58:08.72 --> 00:58:13.80
Because that doesn't really mesh too well with the persuasive leadership that I've

959
00:58:13.80 --> 00:58:16.20
been bragging about about this book.

960
00:58:16.20 --> 00:58:25.36
Force is like, hey, that being said, I understand what they're talking about.

961
00:58:25.36 --> 00:58:33.60
I understand that there's people that will not stop until they have maneuvered into a

962
00:58:33.60 --> 00:58:36.40
position that they want to be in.

963
00:58:36.40 --> 00:58:41.68
So I understand how force and I understand how, let me, let me put you this way.

964
00:58:41.68 --> 00:58:47.28
If I have a seal puttum and I've got a task that needs to get done and there's someone

965
00:58:47.28 --> 00:58:51.56
in the seal puttum that has a high level of force.

966
00:58:51.56 --> 00:58:56.64
And I can say, hey, Bill, go make this happen and Bill goes, got it.

967
00:58:56.64 --> 00:58:58.68
You know he's going to make it happen.

968
00:58:58.68 --> 00:59:03.76
So there, and he might not necessarily use force as his primary tool to make it happen.

969
00:59:03.76 --> 00:59:08.88
He might go and be butter someone up or get some, you know, massage some ego and make something

970
00:59:08.88 --> 00:59:09.88
happen.

971
00:59:09.88 --> 00:59:10.88
That's still using force.

972
00:59:10.88 --> 00:59:14.08
It's just using an indirect force.

973
00:59:14.08 --> 00:59:17.04
So that's what I think we're talking about.

974
00:59:17.04 --> 00:59:25.08
This is humility, which is freedom from arrogance and unjustifiable pride.

975
00:59:25.08 --> 00:59:27.08
Talk about humility all the time.

976
00:59:27.08 --> 00:59:33.68
Humor is the capacity to appreciate the many amusing or whimsical happenings of our everyday

977
00:59:33.68 --> 00:59:37.56
life, especially those which pertain to the leader himself.

978
00:59:37.56 --> 00:59:40.24
So don't take yourself too seriously.

979
00:59:40.24 --> 00:59:42.36
I did a video the other day.

980
00:59:42.36 --> 00:59:47.64
It was like a Monday morning video.

981
00:59:47.64 --> 00:59:49.28
And it was April Fool's Day.

982
00:59:49.28 --> 00:59:51.28
And I got super serious.

983
00:59:51.28 --> 00:59:55.60
And I kind of went off with April Fool's Day as we can or whatever.

984
00:59:55.60 --> 00:59:57.36
I just kind of went off this day.

985
00:59:57.36 --> 01:00:07.000
And a couple people, I think it was two people responded with, you know, I couldn't even

986
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
watch this.

987
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.56
There's nothing wrong with having fun.

988
01:00:12.56 --> 01:00:14.32
I just said, hey man, watch the whole video.

989
01:00:14.32 --> 01:00:15.32
I'm laughing at the end.

990
01:00:15.32 --> 01:00:17.32
It's okay, dude, I get it.

991
01:00:17.32 --> 01:00:19.32
Anything got triggered or something like that?

992
01:00:19.32 --> 01:00:20.32
Yeah, maybe they got triggered.

993
01:00:20.32 --> 01:00:21.32
I don't know.

994
01:00:21.32 --> 01:00:22.32
Yeah, you said so.

995
01:00:22.32 --> 01:00:25.40
I think you posted something like a written thing about how you're like, hey, today's like

996
01:00:25.40 --> 01:00:29.32
one of those days where I need more recovery or something like that, basically indicating

997
01:00:29.32 --> 01:00:31.32
that you're going to take a rest day or whatever.

998
01:00:31.32 --> 01:00:33.76
That was April Fool's Day.

999
01:00:33.76 --> 01:00:34.76
That was what last year.

1000
01:00:34.76 --> 01:00:35.76
Oh, no, you're right.

1001
01:00:35.76 --> 01:00:36.76
I did do that this year.

1002
01:00:36.76 --> 01:00:37.76
Yeah.

1003
01:00:37.76 --> 01:00:40.60
I don't know why I always fall for those.

1004
01:00:40.60 --> 01:00:41.60
It's weird.

1005
01:00:41.60 --> 01:00:44.52
I'm like, oh yeah, I was taking one rest day or whatever.

1006
01:00:44.52 --> 01:00:46.28
And yeah, and you did another one too.

1007
01:00:46.28 --> 01:00:47.92
I think it might have been last year.

1008
01:00:47.92 --> 01:00:49.88
And I was like, totally falling for it.

1009
01:00:49.88 --> 01:00:50.88
Yeah.

1010
01:00:50.88 --> 01:00:55.48
Well, last year I think I was in Montana and I was eating moose tracks.

1011
01:00:55.48 --> 01:00:56.48
I remember that thing.

1012
01:00:56.48 --> 01:00:59.92
And I ate a big joke and I was like, hey, you know, I've been eating moose tracks.

1013
01:00:59.92 --> 01:01:04.20
And I'm just, I'm thinking maybe I've just been too extreme with this whole deal.

1014
01:01:04.20 --> 01:01:06.52
I did a light now.

1015
01:01:06.52 --> 01:01:08.60
But I said, oh, no.

1016
01:01:08.60 --> 01:01:13.000
Anyways, so yes, you got to be able to, you got to have be able to, I think it's important.

1017
01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.16
It's not just having fun, but the most important part of humor is realizing that

1018
01:01:18.16 --> 01:01:22.04
you yourself are going to be the butt of jokes.

1019
01:01:22.04 --> 01:01:23.04
And that's okay.

1020
01:01:23.04 --> 01:01:24.04
Yeah.

1021
01:01:24.04 --> 01:01:28.68
Yeah, and we were talking about that before, where, you know, the guy who can't take it.

1022
01:01:28.68 --> 01:01:32.64
And more so than they can't take it, it's just like you feel uncomfortable joking around

1023
01:01:32.64 --> 01:01:33.64
with him.

1024
01:01:33.64 --> 01:01:36.60
You can joke around everybody else in the, but the one there around is kind of like, hey,

1025
01:01:36.60 --> 01:01:38.28
we shouldn't really joke around as much.

1026
01:01:38.28 --> 01:01:40.48
And that's sort of the dynamic one there around.

1027
01:01:40.48 --> 01:01:42.48
Yeah, and it's not even, it's not even I shouldn't joke around.

1028
01:01:42.48 --> 01:01:44.88
I shouldn't joke around about that person.

1029
01:01:44.88 --> 01:01:45.88
That's what you're talking about.

1030
01:01:45.88 --> 01:01:46.88
Yeah.

1031
01:01:46.88 --> 01:01:49.84
Because there's some people they love to have fun and the minute the mirror shines

1032
01:01:49.84 --> 01:01:53.24
at them or the light shines on them and they become the butt of the joke, they don't

1033
01:01:53.24 --> 01:01:54.24
like it at all.

1034
01:01:54.24 --> 01:01:55.24
Yeah.

1035
01:01:55.24 --> 01:01:59.32
And even if, even if they're like, they don't respond in the snake, it will, even if

1036
01:01:59.32 --> 01:02:02.36
the person is just, they just be quiet.

1037
01:02:02.36 --> 01:02:05.56
You know, that kind of where like, they don't necessarily like insult you back or

1038
01:02:05.56 --> 01:02:06.56
get mad.

1039
01:02:06.56 --> 01:02:09.36
But they're just making those, they just get quiet.

1040
01:02:09.36 --> 01:02:10.36
Yeah.

1041
01:02:10.36 --> 01:02:11.36
Exactly.

1042
01:02:11.36 --> 01:02:14.08
It's like you just can sort of tell, you know, there's like a dynamic when you joke around

1043
01:02:14.08 --> 01:02:15.08
with him.

1044
01:02:15.08 --> 01:02:17.52
But it's like, yeah, it's like wicked man.

1045
01:02:17.52 --> 01:02:19.000
No one wants you around man.

1046
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
And sure.

1047
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.48
We'll do the job boss.

1048
01:02:21.48 --> 01:02:22.48
Yeah.

1049
01:02:22.48 --> 01:02:23.48
Sure.

1050
01:02:23.48 --> 01:02:24.48
But man, no one wants you around.

1051
01:02:24.48 --> 01:02:25.48
Go back in your office.

1052
01:02:25.48 --> 01:02:29.20
Keep your sense of humor, especially about yourself.

1053
01:02:29.20 --> 01:02:31.36
I have, I have a good time with that.

1054
01:02:31.36 --> 01:02:33.36
I have no issue with that.

1055
01:02:33.36 --> 01:02:34.36
Sure.

1056
01:02:34.36 --> 01:02:39.24
Another thing I think is if you, if somebody says something to you, like, makes a joke about

1057
01:02:39.24 --> 01:02:44.44
you and it hurts you, that's, that's your ego.

1058
01:02:44.44 --> 01:02:45.44
Yeah.

1059
01:02:45.44 --> 01:02:46.44
And there's probably truth in what they're saying.

1060
01:02:46.44 --> 01:02:47.44
Yeah.

1061
01:02:47.44 --> 01:02:48.44
And so you need a bad intention to do it.

1062
01:02:48.44 --> 01:02:51.32
How does ego feed into insecurity?

1063
01:02:51.32 --> 01:02:53.64
Because you know how like, cause a lot of it is insecure.

1064
01:02:53.64 --> 01:02:55.12
Like, let's like, you know, you joke around.

1065
01:02:55.12 --> 01:02:57.96
Because it over compensates.

1066
01:02:57.96 --> 01:03:07.36
So if I'm insecure about, if I'm insecure, of, well, if I'm insecure about my leadership

1067
01:03:07.36 --> 01:03:10.92
capabilities that I try and bow up and act like a big leader, that's basically it.

1068
01:03:10.92 --> 01:03:11.92
Right.

1069
01:03:11.92 --> 01:03:16.72
Because your ego is like, hey, I can't, like, I can't deal with this little, like, short

1070
01:03:16.72 --> 01:03:18.20
coming in whatever way.

1071
01:03:18.20 --> 01:03:19.20
That's in my mind, whatever.

1072
01:03:19.20 --> 01:03:20.20
Right.

1073
01:03:20.20 --> 01:03:21.20
So I'm going to, you know, over compensates.

1074
01:03:21.20 --> 01:03:22.20
Yeah.

1075
01:03:22.20 --> 01:03:23.20
That's where you see it.

1076
01:03:23.20 --> 01:03:26.72
And then if someone jokes around about it, it kind of like shines light on it.

1077
01:03:26.72 --> 01:03:27.72
Oh, you don't like that.

1078
01:03:27.72 --> 01:03:28.72
It's just, yeah.

1079
01:03:28.72 --> 01:03:32.24
But it's all in your own, or most of the time, it's like in your own mind, you know?

1080
01:03:32.24 --> 01:03:34.24
How bad it is.

1081
01:03:34.24 --> 01:03:40.92
Next one, initiative is the willingness to act in the absence of orders and to offer

1082
01:03:40.92 --> 01:03:43.56
well considered recommendations for the improvement of the command.

1083
01:03:43.56 --> 01:03:44.56
Awesome.

1084
01:03:44.56 --> 01:03:45.56
Got to have initiative.

1085
01:03:45.56 --> 01:03:46.56
Next is integrity.

1086
01:03:46.56 --> 01:03:52.56
Is the honesty and moral character of the leader that must be unquestioned.

1087
01:03:52.56 --> 01:03:56.36
The intelligence is the intellect of the leader which must be adequate to master the problems

1088
01:03:56.36 --> 01:03:59.24
presented by his level of command.

1089
01:03:59.24 --> 01:04:04.000
Judgment is the power of the mind to weigh various factors and arrive at a wise decision.

1090
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.44
And you know what I talked about, making decisions and one thing that I didn't really talk

1091
01:04:07.44 --> 01:04:11.84
about, I didn't emphasize too much as how do you get better decision making?

1092
01:04:11.84 --> 01:04:13.76
You get better decision making by training.

1093
01:04:13.76 --> 01:04:18.36
You better decision making by putting yourself into situations where this is what's happening.

1094
01:04:18.36 --> 01:04:19.88
And oh, here's the decision I'm going to make.

1095
01:04:19.88 --> 01:04:20.88
Oh, it was completely wrong.

1096
01:04:20.88 --> 01:04:23.72
Cool. I just learned not to make that type of decision before.

1097
01:04:23.72 --> 01:04:24.72
Let me try it again.

1098
01:04:24.72 --> 01:04:28.64
When I was running a tradeout out here for West Coast, that was the whole goal was to put

1099
01:04:28.64 --> 01:04:31.96
guys into situations that they had to make a decision.

1100
01:04:31.96 --> 01:04:33.96
They would make wrong decisions all the time.

1101
01:04:33.96 --> 01:04:39.32
And then I knew they would not make that wrong decision again because once you make it

1102
01:04:39.32 --> 01:04:43.80
and you feel it and it stings and your whole obtune is covered in paintball and they're

1103
01:04:43.80 --> 01:04:47.28
murdered well, you won't make that bad decision again.

1104
01:04:47.28 --> 01:04:49.84
That was the goal.

1105
01:04:49.84 --> 01:04:56.92
Justice is being equitable and impartial in bestowing favors and punishment.

1106
01:04:56.92 --> 01:05:00.000
Loyalty must extend both up and down.

1107
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.80
A leader cannot expect loyalty from his subordinates unless he is conspicuously loyal to them

1108
01:05:05.80 --> 01:05:08.12
and to his superiors.

1109
01:05:08.12 --> 01:05:10.48
That's a big one.

1110
01:05:10.48 --> 01:05:17.08
If you're running around talking smack about your bosses, that's showing your team that

1111
01:05:17.08 --> 01:05:23.52
you're not loyal to and we could go down the whole road of if I have a horrible boss.

1112
01:05:23.52 --> 01:05:24.76
Does that mean I just have a yes man?

1113
01:05:24.76 --> 01:05:27.60
No, I'll frame things for the guys to make them realize they look.

1114
01:05:27.60 --> 01:05:30.000
I know there's some shortfalls here but we got who we got.

1115
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.20
What we're going to do is build a great relationship with them and then at least have

1116
01:05:35.20 --> 01:05:37.40
some saying what's going on.

1117
01:05:37.40 --> 01:05:42.92
So if you see me and it seems like I'm just trying to massage my bosses ego, guess what

1118
01:05:42.92 --> 01:05:43.92
I'm trying to do?

1119
01:05:43.92 --> 01:05:44.92
Trying to massage my bosses ego.

1120
01:05:44.92 --> 01:05:50.60
I want to have a great relationship with them so I can take care of us and besides what

1121
01:05:50.60 --> 01:05:53.20
do we want to do lose influence over him?

1122
01:05:53.20 --> 01:05:55.44
Do you want him to not listen to anything I say?

1123
01:05:55.44 --> 01:05:56.44
No.

1124
01:05:56.44 --> 01:06:00.08
So that's what I'm doing.

1125
01:06:00.08 --> 01:06:05.36
Because if you just if your boss is an idiot and all you do is support him 100% your

1126
01:06:05.36 --> 01:06:06.96
guys are going to start thinking you're an idiot.

1127
01:06:06.96 --> 01:06:09.24
That's not good.

1128
01:06:09.24 --> 01:06:12.24
So there's a fine line that's a tough one to walk.

1129
01:06:12.24 --> 01:06:14.24
Yeah, that's tough one to walk man.

1130
01:06:14.24 --> 01:06:15.24
That's good man.

1131
01:06:15.24 --> 01:06:19.28
It's like a full disclosure situation where it's like hey I get it.

1132
01:06:19.28 --> 01:06:22.08
I get what you guys are saying or whatever but this is why we're doing it kind of thing

1133
01:06:22.08 --> 01:06:26.56
because like how you say if you follow the boss who's a quote unquote idiot and then you

1134
01:06:26.56 --> 01:06:32.20
seem like an idiot and then on the other hand if you're like beat nice of the boss and

1135
01:06:32.20 --> 01:06:34.96
you know being nice and then when you go to your middle and like it's a dumb like talking

1136
01:06:34.96 --> 01:06:38.12
kind of behind his back you're like oh you're too face little guy.

1137
01:06:38.12 --> 01:06:40.68
You don't have to say hey the boss and idiot we're just trying to just try and butter

1138
01:06:40.68 --> 01:06:41.68
them up.

1139
01:06:41.68 --> 01:06:42.68
No you say like hey listen.

1140
01:06:42.68 --> 01:06:46.48
The boss doesn't always see things the way I see them but you know what he is the boss

1141
01:06:46.48 --> 01:06:48.84
and what I'm trying to do is build a good relationship with them.

1142
01:06:48.84 --> 01:06:53.20
I'm trying to do a good job said he listens to what I say so that I can influence him

1143
01:06:53.20 --> 01:06:56.32
and steer him in the right direction on some of these things so that we can accomplish

1144
01:06:56.32 --> 01:06:57.32
our mission better.

1145
01:06:57.32 --> 01:06:59.48
I just got to ask this by a squat guy.

1146
01:06:59.48 --> 01:07:07.000
I was out with the police out North Carolina in Charlotte and you know it was the typical

1147
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.68
question of what do you do when your boss is telling you do something that you don't

1148
01:07:11.68 --> 01:07:12.68
necessarily agree with.

1149
01:07:12.68 --> 01:07:17.88
And it's like okay we can talk about that and I went down the whole road because

1150
01:07:17.88 --> 01:07:22.04
it is a whole road because if your boss is telling you something that's insignificant telling

1151
01:07:22.04 --> 01:07:25.64
you to do something that really doesn't make that much of difference then you just do it

1152
01:07:25.64 --> 01:07:27.88
and you build that relationship a little bit more.

1153
01:07:27.88 --> 01:07:28.88
They say you do something else.

1154
01:07:28.88 --> 01:07:32.16
It's a kind of instinct if maybe it's not the smartest thing maybe there's a more efficient

1155
01:07:32.16 --> 01:07:33.16
way.

1156
01:07:33.16 --> 01:07:36.96
Is that really what you want to follow on your sword for and create a dysfunctional relationship

1157
01:07:36.96 --> 01:07:37.96
with your boss?

1158
01:07:37.96 --> 01:07:40.80
No you're like hey boss got it sounds like good idea hey we'll make it happen.

1159
01:07:40.80 --> 01:07:44.80
And then that goes on and you continue to build a relationship.

1160
01:07:44.80 --> 01:07:49.04
So then eventually when your boss tells you do something that is actually unsafe or unsound

1161
01:07:49.04 --> 01:07:54.08
or unethical, unethical is a different story because if someone's telling you do something

1162
01:07:54.08 --> 01:07:58.28
unethical well it's actually not a different story because if they're telling you do something

1163
01:07:58.28 --> 01:08:04.16
unethical and you say no I will know I will not do that they go cool your fired.

1164
01:08:04.16 --> 01:08:10.68
Yeah and now who's going to come in a yes man and now no one's protecting the guys.

1165
01:08:10.68 --> 01:08:20.96
So yes you don't just give blind loyalty but at the same time you try and build relationships

1166
01:08:20.96 --> 01:08:22.60
that's what you do.

1167
01:08:22.60 --> 01:08:25.96
Yeah to inject your influence later.

1168
01:08:25.96 --> 01:08:26.96
Yeah.

1169
01:08:26.96 --> 01:08:31.16
You put it a real good way a few times where I think it was just at the monster I'm not

1170
01:08:31.16 --> 01:08:32.16
sure.

1171
01:08:32.16 --> 01:08:36.28
I don't know where you said it exactly but how you were like hey if I'm a leader and

1172
01:08:36.28 --> 01:08:38.000
my guy in the school is both ways by the way.

1173
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.08
So if I'm a leader and I have a hundred percent solution to a problem and then but my

1174
01:08:43.08 --> 01:08:48.16
guy comes in and he has a seventy five eighty percent solution I'm going with eighty.

1175
01:08:48.16 --> 01:08:51.44
Right so it could be in these in the situation where your your question example what

1176
01:08:51.44 --> 01:08:54.96
if I disagree with my boss is that why you're disagreeing because you're over here with

1177
01:08:54.96 --> 01:08:59.40
hundreds and he's over here with eighty five or even ninety sometimes there's like look

1178
01:08:59.40 --> 01:09:04.000
how much you know so I disagree with your plan because you're doing you know it could

1179
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.52
be that got it boss let's do it.

1180
01:09:06.52 --> 01:09:10.44
How good because up and down the chain of command you are correct.

1181
01:09:10.44 --> 01:09:17.48
The classic example of this is in band of brothers when Dick Winners gets tasked his

1182
01:09:17.48 --> 01:09:22.24
guys to go over and do reconnaissance across the river they go they do the reconnaissance

1183
01:09:22.24 --> 01:09:27.64
they get in the firefight they lose a guy it's a disaster they come back and then Dick Winners

1184
01:09:27.64 --> 01:09:32.28
boss says do it again tomorrow night and then by the way the war is like all but over at

1185
01:09:32.28 --> 01:09:39.88
this point and he says okay boss and then he goes and tells us guys hey going going the

1186
01:09:39.88 --> 01:09:44.44
cello of one of these buildings and sit there for four hours and then come back and I'm

1187
01:09:44.44 --> 01:09:48.12
going to tell them that you guys didn't see anything and that's what they do so that is

1188
01:09:48.12 --> 01:09:55.56
disobeying in order that is that's what it is but it wasn't the right thing to do yes it

1189
01:09:55.56 --> 01:10:00.68
was you put more guys to risk and to say boss I totally disagree I'm not doing it he was

1190
01:10:00.68 --> 01:10:06.76
said okay fine your fired winners give me another young officer and I'll make him go do it

1191
01:10:07.16 --> 01:10:11.24
and the other guy who's trying to get up the chain of command he does it and then gets another

1192
01:10:11.24 --> 01:10:18.60
guy killed yeah so there are situations and of course is that like the norm no not saying that's

1193
01:10:18.60 --> 01:10:24.60
the norm I'm saying an extreme case the war is almost over we just lost a guy this this

1194
01:10:24.60 --> 01:10:29.56
reconnaissance has no impact on the war whatsoever if they were even going to planning to go

1195
01:10:29.56 --> 01:10:35.40
and fight it was just a recon just just to do it and so I was like no we're not doing that so

1196
01:10:37.96 --> 01:10:42.04
that's it loyalty trying build that loyalty up and down the chain of command sympathy

1197
01:10:42.84 --> 01:10:49.32
is the capacity of sharing the feelings of those with whom one is associated you know I don't

1198
01:10:49.32 --> 01:10:55.08
like talk about feelings very much actually you don't but the thing in practice like you do that

1199
01:10:55.08 --> 01:11:00.92
surprisingly good and I don't want to say surprising like I'm surprised but sometimes I'm pretty impressed

1200
01:11:00.92 --> 01:11:07.40
with your sympathetic abilities I guess empathy right yeah empathy like I understand we're

1201
01:11:07.40 --> 01:11:12.44
coming from and I you know I always use the word perspective and I think maybe it's just because

1202
01:11:12.44 --> 01:11:18.60
it's a more of a tougher word you know than feelings sure but I'll say hey you need to because

1203
01:11:18.60 --> 01:11:25.88
let's face it it won't sound right if I say hey listen put your commander you need to really just

1204
01:11:25.88 --> 01:11:30.12
just reach out and touch the feelings of your man right that doesn't sound right

1205
01:11:30.12 --> 01:11:36.28
sure does it from no no it doesn't sound right factually if I say hey listen put your

1206
01:11:36.28 --> 01:11:40.28
commander you need to understand the perspective that your guys are seeing this from you need to

1207
01:11:40.28 --> 01:11:44.92
see that they're thinking you're just driving them to do something that doesn't matter or whatever

1208
01:11:44.92 --> 01:11:49.32
you know the same thing yeah but I use tougher words because you know that's how you're

1209
01:11:49.32 --> 01:11:55.64
tougher oh yeah yeah you know when I'll come to you with like this conundrum or you know

1210
01:11:55.64 --> 01:12:00.60
something going on in my nose or what have you but you're talking about with humans now with

1211
01:12:00.60 --> 01:12:06.28
people yeah okay and even you you're sympathy kind of towards me where it may be on the surface

1212
01:12:06.28 --> 01:12:13.48
you might sort of expect you to be like oh man up or you know something like this but you'll like

1213
01:12:13.48 --> 01:12:19.000
you'll kind of give me my do like sympathy even with what you say like you'll you'll

1214
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.92
sympathize like you'll be like hey you're like man that is a bummer or whatever you

1215
01:12:22.92 --> 01:12:29.40
know whatever the words you say well the thing is if I didn't do that then I you have you won't

1216
01:12:29.40 --> 01:12:34.60
want to listen to what I'm actually about tell you to do yeah because sometimes the solution is hard

1217
01:12:34.60 --> 01:12:38.84
yeah right sometimes the solutions to these things are hard and

1218
01:12:38.84 --> 01:12:46.12
if you don't open up that door a little bit to build a little something yeah open up then

1219
01:12:46.12 --> 01:12:52.52
you just not you're just gonna say oh yeah what what you'll think is I'm not Jaco and what he

1220
01:12:52.52 --> 01:12:56.92
says doesn't apply to me yeah yeah yeah if I say oh look that's what's happening

1221
01:12:56.92 --> 01:13:01.56
or you need to just cut away but whatever you need to just tell that person you know no more

1222
01:13:02.20 --> 01:13:07.40
like no I have you man that's a rough situation to be in I think what's gonna happen here I mean

1223
01:13:07.40 --> 01:13:12.84
if you way it out the only real solution is for you to kind of back away from that scenario you

1224
01:13:12.84 --> 01:13:17.72
know what I mean so I kind of brought you in right made you think that I'm human and then

1225
01:13:17.72 --> 01:13:25.40
boom there we go I think it next tacked is the ability to deal with support and since

1226
01:13:25.40 --> 01:13:31.96
appears in an appropriate manner without giving offense boy that seems like so simple

1227
01:13:31.96 --> 01:13:39.56
but man tacked people got mad or didn't get mad what did I say I said tacked Trump's the truth

1228
01:13:40.76 --> 01:13:49.88
on a podcast whenever and some people went all Sam Harris on me so like you never ever

1229
01:13:53.88 --> 01:14:00.76
and then I brought up 48 examples of where oh so what you should do is just be true for

1230
01:14:00.76 --> 01:14:10.92
all times no you know there's times where what I thought you your performance I thought was

1231
01:14:10.92 --> 01:14:17.56
pathetic and embarrassing and disastrous and yet you're in the position I need you to do a good

1232
01:14:17.56 --> 01:14:21.88
job I need your morale to stay high I see that you're beat down yourself so instead of telling

1233
01:14:21.88 --> 01:14:27.32
you all those things I preemptively tell you hey look this is a really hard task yeah and I know

1234
01:14:27.32 --> 01:14:31.40
it was challenging and you probably weren't quite ready because I didn't give you enough information

1235
01:14:32.04 --> 01:14:37.72
but here's some things I think will help next time around yeah right I didn't tell you the full

1236
01:14:37.72 --> 01:14:43.16
truth I mean I didn't lie to you either so maybe that's so maybe that's a different between

1237
01:14:43.16 --> 01:14:50.68
Sam Harris and Jordan because what Jordan Petersen says is tell the truth or at least don't lie

1238
01:14:51.24 --> 01:14:55.40
so there's there's a little gray area between those two let's spark another debate between those two

1239
01:14:55.40 --> 01:15:02.68
guys yeah and I shoot I kind of in a way agree with both if I even understand them 100% but yeah like

1240
01:15:02.68 --> 01:15:06.84
you know because it's all kinds of lies and there's lying by all mission and there's this one they say

1241
01:15:06.84 --> 01:15:15.08
white lies and then they say but uh I think it's black lies what is that but lying by by omission

1242
01:15:15.08 --> 01:15:19.08
or whatever it's like you know you're telling the truth but you're leaving out stuff to kind of

1243
01:15:19.08 --> 01:15:22.92
lead them in a certain direction or whatever to make them think certain stuff there's then there's that

1244
01:15:22.92 --> 01:15:28.20
you know so it's like all right it can like he's he he he he he he getting to a lot of gray area there and I

1245
01:15:28.20 --> 01:15:33.88
guess there's times where you know the classic example that I guess Sam Harris talks about is

1246
01:15:35.16 --> 01:15:41.96
should you tell your wife when your wife comes out and says do I look fat yeah what you should say is

1247
01:15:42.68 --> 01:15:43.96
yes

1248
01:15:45.96 --> 01:15:50.84
maybe that in the right right right but to his point if you don't say that well then

1249
01:15:50.84 --> 01:15:55.48
yeah you let her you can let her continue on where we pass on that's not good and ends up in a

1250
01:15:55.48 --> 01:16:05.000
bad way so so a little bit of credit there but to give a little push back on Sam if you are just

1251
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:10.20
straight up a jerk about it well guess what we haven't done what we just talked about which is I haven't

1252
01:16:10.20 --> 01:16:16.52
built a little bridge and connected and said you know and so now all she's gonna do is you

1253
01:16:16.52 --> 01:16:21.32
got fat and then now we have an anger situation now they might listen anything that you're gonna say

1254
01:16:21.32 --> 01:16:27.16
and now we might ruin a relationship based on the fact that we went too hardcore now to Sam's point

1255
01:16:27.16 --> 01:16:31.80
if you don't ever indicate any kind of truth then you just let a person continue on a path that

1256
01:16:32.36 --> 01:16:37.40
bad for them and is bad for their in this case they're wait well and that's not good either

1257
01:16:37.96 --> 01:16:43.88
but the key component if you have tact and you build a relationship because basically I think I

1258
01:16:43.88 --> 01:16:47.56
had this conversation with LaFa little while ago you know when you're dealing with someone

1259
01:16:47.56 --> 01:16:54.60
when you're dealing with a team you're either forwarding and improving the relationship or you

1260
01:16:54.60 --> 01:17:01.32
know you could be neutral or you're making it go backwards what we want to be doing is improving

1261
01:17:01.32 --> 01:17:07.32
the relationship at a minimum we want to remain neutral and every other aspect of going backwards

1262
01:17:07.32 --> 01:17:12.12
in a relationship is bad so if we're business partners and we have a we have a discussion about

1263
01:17:12.12 --> 01:17:16.76
something I want the result of that discussion to be that our relationship improved yeah

1264
01:17:17.32 --> 01:17:22.60
at a minimum I want to be neutral and worst case we've actually gone backwards because that's not

1265
01:17:22.60 --> 01:17:28.84
not good so now we start talking about your spouse we want that relationship to improve we don't

1266
01:17:28.84 --> 01:17:35.64
want it to go backwards and neutral is a minimum so when we when we get asked the question do I look

1267
01:17:35.64 --> 01:17:42.44
fat and the answer is absolutely yeah that's going to be that's not going to lead to that's not

1268
01:17:42.44 --> 01:17:49.24
going to lead to the it's not going to lead to your spouse respecting and listening to what you're

1269
01:17:49.24 --> 01:17:54.68
saying it's going to lead to your spouse saying oh you're a jerk you don't know how hard it is

1270
01:17:54.68 --> 01:18:00.36
for me you're not part of my team you're on a different team and therefore since we're on different

1271
01:18:00.36 --> 01:18:05.88
teams I don't need to listen anything that you say yeah so there's better way to go about it

1272
01:18:05.88 --> 01:18:14.76
tact then that's called tact yeah and I have these talks with my brother Jade from time to time

1273
01:18:14.76 --> 01:18:21.48
and so an example is like if you like if you're a character you know you guys like you use a word

1274
01:18:21.48 --> 01:18:26.76
wrong or say a word pronounced a word wrong like the guy who's so quick to always correct you

1275
01:18:26.76 --> 01:18:32.28
in front of people doesn't matter whatever you know you're a character usually those

1276
01:18:32.28 --> 01:18:37.32
characters people those character people are they're right you know and then they're telling

1277
01:18:37.32 --> 01:18:41.88
the truth it's true it's correct you know so what they're saying is they're correct and they're

1278
01:18:41.88 --> 01:18:48.04
lonely because not like you're saying yes because look no tact right so that what they're saying

1279
01:18:48.04 --> 01:18:53.72
is correct what they're doing is not correct like you shouldn't do that and that's like essentially

1280
01:18:53.72 --> 01:18:58.36
what tact is you know it's not like you're saying hey did I say that right and you're like hey you

1281
01:18:58.36 --> 01:19:03.48
know you didn't say that right and it's different too to pull someone aside and say hey man hey

1282
01:19:03.48 --> 01:19:09.72
just just want to let you know you mispronounce this word right now yeah there's and I I don't

1283
01:19:09.72 --> 01:19:13.88
like the fact that I mispronounce words and I do it on this podcast on a fairly regular basis

1284
01:19:14.60 --> 01:19:19.56
and occasionally someone will hit me up and say hey you mispronounce this word that word

1285
01:19:19.56 --> 01:19:26.60
someone sent me a either an email or something the other day that was like you mispronounce words

1286
01:19:26.60 --> 01:19:30.60
this would not be that hard to fix you should pay attention or whatever something that was pretty

1287
01:19:30.60 --> 01:19:38.36
pretty pretty straightforward right and I was like yeah you know that's a bummer because the thing is

1288
01:19:41.16 --> 01:19:46.84
I don't like mispronouncing words and yet the corrective measures

1289
01:19:46.84 --> 01:19:55.80
for not mispronouncing words is for instance if we're going and I'll listen I'm saying something

1290
01:19:55.80 --> 01:20:00.84
wrong and I'm like hold on let me go back let me interrupt one of my thought pattern let me

1291
01:20:00.84 --> 01:20:05.56
interrupt what I'm saying to try and figure out if I pronounce this thing right or wrong

1292
01:20:06.28 --> 01:20:14.84
I lean towards it's better to just flow and get corrected later so I apologize for my

1293
01:20:14.84 --> 01:20:22.36
mispronounced words yeah my bus I should do a better job like that guy who emailed me that I'm sorry

1294
01:20:22.36 --> 01:20:32.12
the last one is unselfishness unselfishness is the study devoidance of caring for or providing for

1295
01:20:32.12 --> 01:20:42.92
one's own comfort or advantage at the expense of others anytime that you as the leader

1296
01:20:42.92 --> 01:20:49.000
are getting the good deal while your people are getting shafted they notice it and they don't

1297
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:56.12
like it they don't like it at all so and it's weird because the military does that that's the way

1298
01:20:56.12 --> 01:21:03.08
the military operates the officers get paid more money the officers live in officers quarters

1299
01:21:04.12 --> 01:21:12.04
the e-dogs are down in the village of the ship and the hot nasty and just that's the way it is so

1300
01:21:12.04 --> 01:21:20.52
there's a little bit of that but there's there's a saying in the military rank has its privileges

1301
01:21:21.32 --> 01:21:27.24
and it's sort of a stoppy thing to say in my opinion but anyways I guess the point I was going to

1302
01:21:27.24 --> 01:21:32.68
make is when I had when I had officers that were that I really had a lot of respect for they would

1303
01:21:32.68 --> 01:21:37.64
always downplay that and never rub it in your face basically yeah because there is a separation hey

1304
01:21:37.64 --> 01:21:42.28
these guys are in a leadership position they have more responsibility and therefore they're

1305
01:21:42.28 --> 01:21:47.88
getting paid more and they're getting treated a little bit elevated okay but when someone would rub

1306
01:21:47.88 --> 01:21:54.04
that in your face boy that just doesn't make you mad right what's the expression one you know

1307
01:21:54.04 --> 01:21:59.24
the ear boss or what someone who outranks you it's not necessarily it's not in the military I

1308
01:21:59.24 --> 01:22:04.04
don't think but it's like you know this it's like I have a few more letters in my title or something

1309
01:22:04.04 --> 01:22:08.28
like that or a few more oh no expression like my title has a few more letters in it but

1310
01:22:08.28 --> 01:22:14.44
however it's something like that oh yeah my boss told me that one time yeah like straight up like

1311
01:22:14.44 --> 01:22:19.80
I was this is back in the club dude I think I told you this told you that straight up yeah well here's

1312
01:22:19.80 --> 01:22:25.32
the thing so in in our club there was an area you couldn't go in if you had a dress code in this

1313
01:22:25.32 --> 01:22:30.20
area it was like a dumb dress code too by the way but and we all knew it everyone knew it that it was

1314
01:22:30.20 --> 01:22:36.68
kind of dumb it's like you couldn't wear jeans yeah like jeans what about origin jeans it's

1315
01:22:38.12 --> 01:22:43.56
a way before origin jeans unless you could wear jeans so whatever so one day I was it was like I

1316
01:22:43.56 --> 01:22:47.56
wasn't working and I was wearing jeans all my friends were not wearing jeans there were there so

1317
01:22:47.56 --> 01:22:52.52
I was like it's like kind of go right and then my boss was working and he said hey like you can't

1318
01:22:52.52 --> 01:22:57.32
be in here with jeans on someone like all right dang okay you know in front of everybody but

1319
01:22:57.32 --> 01:23:02.52
cool man alright so I left and then it was like a week later he was awesome deal that just the

1320
01:23:02.52 --> 01:23:10.84
roles were reversed oh yeah he's up there jeans full on like doing it and I was jokingly I said hey

1321
01:23:10.84 --> 01:23:16.20
you can't be here with jeans you know and that's what he told me he said I have a few more letters in my

1322
01:23:16.20 --> 01:23:24.52
title damn he's the manager so he met in the track level for him to go up or down well yeah I

1323
01:23:24.52 --> 01:23:28.84
put it this way it wouldn't went down if it wasn't at zero already yeah I wouldn't

1324
01:23:28.84 --> 01:23:34.68
it done yeah don't do that beyond selfish and the other thing is when you do

1325
01:23:34.68 --> 01:23:39.88
on selfish things like the people notice it and if you're doing them because hey if they also

1326
01:23:39.88 --> 01:23:46.04
notice this if you're doing something on selfish because you want credit for it that doesn't work either

1327
01:23:46.04 --> 01:23:53.000
oh yeah it's like if you're like oh yeah you're doing something because you want that outcome

1328
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.24
if you're you when you do something for your troops you should do it because you care about your

1329
01:23:57.24 --> 01:24:03.96
troops yeah not because you're trying to build up a good image yeah good image with your troops

1330
01:24:03.96 --> 01:24:09.16
sick to know man you guys have been busing your ass for me and I'm gonna handle this thing over here

1331
01:24:09.16 --> 01:24:13.96
so you guys can go get some time off go yeah it's not it's not hey if I do this thing for those

1332
01:24:13.96 --> 01:24:19.72

1334
01:24:25.08 --> 01:24:30.92
yes it's fracked they noticed that more than the good deed you did yeah what okay what about this

1335
01:24:30.92 --> 01:24:36.12
though what about if they you know how like this is a commoner where you make a donation right

1336
01:24:36.12 --> 01:24:41.24
to to whatever charity or cause or whatever right and you should we just and you know and they

1337
01:24:41.24 --> 01:24:45.88
celebrate we just made this donation to this charity or whatever like how about that because that's

1338
01:24:45.88 --> 01:24:51.24
what you're it's kind of doing you're publicizing yeah no you're well okay I get that people do that

1339
01:24:51.80 --> 01:24:58.76
and then you take that and you compare that to someone that says oh well like they investigate

1340
01:24:58.76 --> 01:25:04.36
some politician and then they go this politicians are you know a horrible person and investigate

1341
01:25:04.36 --> 01:25:08.28
him and they find out that he's donated millions of dollars to all these different charities but

1342
01:25:08.28 --> 01:25:13.64
never said a word about it you're a spec for that person goes as opposed to someone that's

1343
01:25:13.64 --> 01:25:17.40
donated millions of dollars and he's like hey let's do another photo shoot of me donating

1344
01:25:17.40 --> 01:25:25.96
right there's the big giant no four by six check yeah hundred thousand dollars thing on it yeah

1345
01:25:25.96 --> 01:25:31.32
yeah that's at the front of their website yeah so at the end of the day it's more about like

1346
01:25:31.32 --> 01:25:37.32
okay so what message was sort of sent and received like is the message is the front running message

1347
01:25:37.32 --> 01:25:43.48
the fact that I am so generous that I donate and I do these things or is the message that oh my gosh

1348
01:25:43.48 --> 01:25:48.12
it's so good now that this you know charity whatever gets the help that they want kind of thing

1349
01:25:48.12 --> 01:25:52.84
you know what's you know what people underestimate all the time people underestimate

1350
01:25:55.24 --> 01:26:01.72
how well other people can see what's going on they say I get personally that I see people

1351
01:26:01.72 --> 01:26:09.80
I say man do you really think that anybody you're fooling anyone and it usually happens

1352
01:26:10.84 --> 01:26:16.52
it usually happens with people that are well they're obviously they're smart but they're they're

1353
01:26:16.52 --> 01:26:22.20
so they think they're so smart right they think they're so smart I always think to myself man

1354
01:26:23.08 --> 01:26:29.40
do you really think that anyone is do you think you're getting this over on any one so we we make

1355
01:26:29.40 --> 01:26:33.32
these mistakes like this is a classic example when you do something cool but you're just doing it

1356
01:26:33.32 --> 01:26:38.52
because you want that credit everybody sees that everybody sees it goes oh yeah you just do

1357
01:26:38.52 --> 01:26:42.20
that's trying to look cool because you know why they know that because two days ago you screwed

1358
01:26:42.20 --> 01:26:47.08
them and now you're trying to be all cool yeah but people make that mistake all the time I'm

1359
01:26:47.08 --> 01:26:55.64
a hypersensitive to what other people are like how they perceive I realize that any facade that I put

1360
01:26:55.64 --> 01:27:02.52
up is just it's anyone basically anyone can see sure you might fall a couple people but people just look

1361
01:27:02.52 --> 01:27:08.84
at you go oh that's garbage oh yeah I don't believe you but it's in and I'm agreeing with you

1362
01:27:08.84 --> 01:27:14.68
but I'm not agreeing with you in being like yeah and I don't do that but to me everyone does that

1363
01:27:14.68 --> 01:27:21.24
literally everyone does it and literally everyone is not like less aware how you say like it's like

1364
01:27:21.24 --> 01:27:27.48
under what you say you under yes so to me everyone and that's why the one that's why the

1365
01:27:27.48 --> 01:27:35.56
important thing is when you're doing things do them from the place of honesty right do them

1366
01:27:35.56 --> 01:27:39.88
from you know I'll say things like I'm trying to think of a good example where I say hey you

1367
01:27:39.88 --> 01:27:46.84
got to do this and then I'll say you got to do this now say but you got to actually mean well just

1368
01:27:46.84 --> 01:27:51.16
take it I mean the real easy example is like take ownership of something right I'll say hey you got to take

1369
01:27:51.16 --> 01:27:56.04
ownership of that but I'm not saying hey take ownership of that because then everyone will think that

1370
01:27:56.04 --> 01:28:01.16
you're a marker and then no one will be mad at you no that's not why you're doing it you're taking

1371
01:28:01.16 --> 01:28:05.64
ownership because you have to actually believe that you're the one that's in charge of that and that

1372
01:28:05.64 --> 01:28:10.84
you were truly responsible for what had happened when somebody asked me if if I would have taken

1373
01:28:10.84 --> 01:28:15.72
extreme ownership if I would have gotten fired with that have changed my view it's like no my view

1374
01:28:15.72 --> 01:28:21.56
was and is that as the leader I'm responsible for everything that happens yeah that's truly responsible

1375
01:28:21.56 --> 01:28:30.68
not not hey oh I read in a book I read in the the FM 10 tack 22 that that I'm supposed to be

1376
01:28:30.68 --> 01:28:35.72
responsible so I'm gonna raise my hand and say I'm responsible no you have to truly believe it in

1377
01:28:35.72 --> 01:28:43.000
that thing yeah and and what's good is if you can do that exercise with yourself and say to yourself

1378
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.64
wait a second why am I saying this do I truly believe what I'm saying yeah and if you don't

1379
01:28:47.64 --> 01:28:52.60
you have to say wait a second this isn't that's not right it's not right to do that you need to

1380
01:28:52.60 --> 01:28:59.32
actually believe what you're saying yeah and then after you realize that you know you're not right

1381
01:28:59.32 --> 01:29:04.28
you look up and realize that everyone else is already there everyone else already sees that yeah

1382
01:29:04.28 --> 01:29:08.52
you don't believe here's another one when guys when a girl breaks up with a guy and the guy is

1383
01:29:08.52 --> 01:29:15.72
all heartbroken right and they'll say you know I don't know what to do and I'll say look you have to

1384
01:29:15.72 --> 01:29:22.12
not you have to not care and so what they think I'm saying is act like they don't care

1385
01:29:23.24 --> 01:29:28.36
but I'm not saying that I'm saying you have to not care you have to actually not carry

1386
01:29:28.36 --> 01:29:34.04
you have to actually say hey this person was not who I thought they were and I don't care that

1387
01:29:34.04 --> 01:29:39.08
they're gone and I'm gonna move on if you say that that's your best possible outcome if all

1388
01:29:39.08 --> 01:29:44.36
you're doing is acting that way and it's still driving you crazy goes back to what we just said

1389
01:29:44.36 --> 01:29:48.84
if you're just acting that way guess what the female in the situation absolutely knows that

1390
01:29:48.84 --> 01:29:54.92
you're just trying to act that way yeah they have the I mean human beings have a certain level

1391
01:29:54.92 --> 01:30:01.88
of perception of of the way other people's emotions are like you can perceive it unconsciously they

1392
01:30:01.88 --> 01:30:06.92
perceive it unconsciously or consciously you know it's like you're like I have a dog my dog can

1393
01:30:06.92 --> 01:30:13.56
kind of know what I'm thinking and that's a damn dog with a brain like a size of a walnut or

1394
01:30:13.56 --> 01:30:20.36
whatever how big a big a dog's brain is right not big my dog can't speak English right

1395
01:30:20.36 --> 01:30:29.56
but my dog if I come home and I I go I act a certain way like he knows it and so when you act

1396
01:30:29.56 --> 01:30:34.76
like when you're acting like you don't care that girl can see that you care and it doesn't

1397
01:30:34.76 --> 01:30:40.04
work you have to actually not care when you are trying to do something good for your troops because

1398
01:30:40.04 --> 01:30:48.84
you want to win score points with them they know that when you're trying to prop up so so this

1399
01:30:48.84 --> 01:30:54.68
okay this is a good example when I said hey I'm trying to build a relationship with a boss that's

1400
01:30:54.68 --> 01:30:59.88
why I'm going to act this way right that's different because that boss is going to say oh he's

1401
01:30:59.88 --> 01:31:06.04
just trying to butter me up it's like no actually oh boss you want to done that way I believe

1402
01:31:06.04 --> 01:31:10.52
that's the best thing we can do is try and get it done that way so here I go I'm going to make it happen

1403
01:31:10.52 --> 01:31:15.96
it's not hey I'm going to skate around and sneak around and try and fool you no I'm going to

1404
01:31:15.96 --> 01:31:20.36
believe in what I'm doing yeah I'm going to believe that you have some higher intention that you're

1405
01:31:20.36 --> 01:31:28.28
focused on and that's cool with me you have to take it to the next level man you have to take it to

1406
01:31:28.28 --> 01:31:33.72
the next level you got to believe what you're doing you got to believe it yeah and when you don't

1407
01:31:34.36 --> 01:31:38.92
people know every assume that everyone knows it yeah but my brother we're talking with me

1408
01:31:38.92 --> 01:31:44.76
Greg Macontire and my brother yes Greg I think for whatever Greg Trin and we're basically

1409
01:31:44.76 --> 01:31:50.60
conce like telling my brother hey like come back to duty he's been out of the game for a while

1410
01:31:50.60 --> 01:31:55.48
and then so he's like he's making up this total story oh god and hard here it

1411
01:31:55.48 --> 01:32:01.64
and you know he's good at those debate you know and he's talking about this and this and like being

1412
01:32:01.64 --> 01:32:06.68
Greg Trin or like not really saying that much stuff he didn't be like two of his excuses

1413
01:32:06.68 --> 01:32:11.40
um that you know since he's like sort out of shape right or since he's actually

1414
01:32:11.40 --> 01:32:15.16
going to wait to get back and shape right for him that's what we're asking but when you ask it

1415
01:32:15.16 --> 01:32:20.28
direct like that it sounds dumb you know so he's like no what's no it's not that it's you know so

1416
01:32:20.28 --> 01:32:26.68
if I'm like so exhausted you know I like I like training and I like kind of conversating with

1417
01:32:26.68 --> 01:32:32.44
it with everybody at the end and stuff like that so if I'm like so exhausted from training not only

1418
01:32:32.44 --> 01:32:38.12
is that experience kind of diminished then I'm too exhausted to have like a good conversation go

1419
01:32:38.12 --> 01:32:44.36
D. He he said it way more like could you laugh at him I would bro if you I wanted him to yes

1420
01:32:44.36 --> 01:32:48.76
I was laughing you realize you're talking about this right yes okay and then you will be good

1421
01:32:48.76 --> 01:32:53.80
thing well okay so me and it was right as Greg was sort of leaving right so I'm looking at Greg's

1422
01:32:53.80 --> 01:32:58.28
face and Greg has that look on his face that we all kind of get but Greg really gets it on his face

1423
01:32:58.28 --> 01:33:04.52
kind of like just wait all right bro whatever you say kind of thing um totally not believing right

1424
01:33:04.52 --> 01:33:10.84
and I'm there man is I'm like can you hear yourself like that's not even a believable thing you know

1425
01:33:10.84 --> 01:33:15.80
can you be so exhausted that you can't talk afterwards can you do that especially I'm sure you can

1426
01:33:15.80 --> 01:33:22.12
if you're ran a foot I don't know hundred and then he could yeah yeah no he he can't put it

1427
01:33:22.12 --> 01:33:26.76
that way and we all know that so anyway so so Greg sort of leaves and leaves it at that and I'm

1428
01:33:26.76 --> 01:33:32.68
sitting there like kind of looking at him and I was like but just like all right that's that's not true

1429
01:33:32.68 --> 01:33:37.72
you know we I know why you're not gonna go it's not a big deal you know we have friends that do

1430
01:33:37.72 --> 01:33:42.44
that same thing oh yeah sure I'll be back but I just don't want to go tomorrow because of this and

1431
01:33:42.44 --> 01:33:48.52
that and this and we're like those aren't even like applicable excuses you know and he was like

1432
01:33:48.52 --> 01:33:52.60
he's like you're right you're right you're right hundred percent right hundred you totally admitted it

1433
01:33:52.60 --> 01:33:57.08
you know so we see back on the mat because he was not here today no you know

1434
01:33:57.08 --> 01:34:02.36
eight y'all's get back on the mat he got good quick to that and that's kind of part of the

1435
01:34:02.36 --> 01:34:09.24
the whole picture you know it's like you're based on what do you think that he will he

1436
01:34:10.44 --> 01:34:17.56
learned learned anything from you just by being your twin brother no no no it's kind of similar

1437
01:34:17.56 --> 01:34:22.92
way to me although his game is very different from yours yeah and maybe from like

1438
01:34:22.92 --> 01:34:30.04
like he's like has an analytical mind you know so if like if I do like if he asks oh here's another

1439
01:34:30.04 --> 01:34:35.16
thing yes kind of indirectly from being my twin brother so medium can communicate like spot on

1440
01:34:35.16 --> 01:34:40.04
that's it's like we won't run into miss understanding very often so it's a few years

1441
01:34:40.04 --> 01:34:44.04
long about not training you did so well that was being without weakness you're talking

1442
01:34:44.04 --> 01:34:49.48
about like he underestimating under people's reception now was hit that which he has obviously

1443
01:34:49.48 --> 01:34:55.64
like we all do but yeah so if he has a question or he hears me talking about something

1444
01:34:55.64 --> 01:35:00.12
you do to wise he picks up on it I think in that way real quick and you know he's a

1445
01:35:00.12 --> 01:35:07.08
fun you not explain things really well to him because you have 40 years of common language

1446
01:35:07.08 --> 01:35:11.96
and experience to say hey remember when I do this or hey remember and football and that or hey

1447
01:35:11.96 --> 01:35:16.44
remember when whatever you got all this stuff you can communicate through the tone right you know

1448
01:35:16.44 --> 01:35:22.36
right yeah so yeah so I'd say there's that you know but yeah he did he got the

1449
01:35:22.36 --> 01:35:26.68
quick the interesting thing about underestimating the way that everyone else thinks

1450
01:35:27.72 --> 01:35:35.16
is when you do that first of all it's there they know and if you actually just live your life

1451
01:35:35.16 --> 01:35:38.92
in a way that you're not trying to put up fronts your life is going to be better yeah

1452
01:35:39.64 --> 01:35:44.84
and if you live your life thinking that guess what at a minimum people are going to someone's

1453
01:35:44.84 --> 01:35:48.28
going to know that this is a front if you do that it's kind of like when I told the

1454
01:35:49.88 --> 01:35:55.16
I've told a bunch of soldiers officers that they had a psycho path in their pontoon

1455
01:35:56.68 --> 01:36:01.64
and like every if you're if you got 40 and I went through this with Jordan where I asked

1456
01:36:01.64 --> 01:36:06.92
him I said hey is I said if you have 40 people in a military in a pontoon in an infantry

1457
01:36:06.92 --> 01:36:13.80
pontoon is one of them a sadist and he's like absolutely absolutely and and then I he said one

1458
01:36:13.80 --> 01:36:17.48
and a hundred is good but in the military you've already eliminated a bunch of you know

1459
01:36:17.48 --> 01:36:23.24
weak or yeah you've eliminated all non say it because there's no there's no one that's like

1460
01:36:23.24 --> 01:36:28.84
not at least has some tendency to to be able to kill people right those people are in the

1461
01:36:28.84 --> 01:36:32.52
pontoon so you've eliminated a bunch of people that have zero chance of being a say this they're

1462
01:36:32.52 --> 01:36:39.48
not in there so one out of 40's not bad so if you treat your pontoon as if you have a say

1463
01:36:39.48 --> 01:36:44.12
to stand there then you will eliminate that problem from getting out of hand so that's what you do so

1464
01:36:44.12 --> 01:36:49.80
if you treat your life as if people will see through the lies in the fronts that you're trying

1465
01:36:49.80 --> 01:36:55.24
to put up for them you'll do better in life and you'll have a better pontoon and you'll have a better

1466
01:36:55.24 --> 01:37:04.36
life yeah that's good enough you push yeah all right leadership techniques it is important to

1467
01:37:04.36 --> 01:37:08.68
note that in small units the leader can influence and direct his men through close personal

1468
01:37:08.68 --> 01:37:12.92
contact whereas in large units he must rely in great measure upon his staff and subordinate

1469
01:37:12.92 --> 01:37:18.28
commanders to a system in making his leadership effective the larger the unit the more complex

1470
01:37:18.28 --> 01:37:26.36
the problems of leadership but the greater the greater become the means available to the commander

1471
01:37:26.36 --> 01:37:31.000
to assist him in the exercise of his leadership so as you grow problems get more complex but you

1472
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:36.44
end up with you have more people you have more tools the larger unit commander must consider carefully

1473
01:37:36.44 --> 01:37:41.96
the leadership aspect of all basic policies which he prescribes your tolerance okay this is what's

1474
01:37:41.96 --> 01:37:47.000
interesting so we work with companies that grow really quickly especially nowadays in the

1475
01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:53.32
start-up world in the tech world and this is where they have a tough time transitioning because when

1476
01:37:53.32 --> 01:38:00.92
you're in a room you're not in an office and you got six people in there guess what your leadership

1477
01:38:00.92 --> 01:38:06.20
is really easy right you're talking you know him you communicate with him you guess to 20 people okay

1478
01:38:06.20 --> 01:38:09.48
it's a little tricky but still you're all in the room you're meeting you're seeing each other every

1479
01:38:09.48 --> 01:38:15.48
day 30 40 I guess what we're still all pretty much in a room everyone's having lunch where still

1480
01:38:15.48 --> 01:38:24.36
a unit all of a sudden kicks out 200 200 300 and this is where if you don't insert good

1481
01:38:24.36 --> 01:38:30.04
decentralized command good leadership tactics in there that's where these tech companies we're

1482
01:38:30.04 --> 01:38:35.24
and it's not just tech companies any growing company loses it they lose it because they haven't

1483
01:38:35.24 --> 01:38:40.60
put the command structure in place so that the vision of the commander and the vision of the

1484
01:38:40.60 --> 01:38:45.48
leadership gets distilled all the way down through the chain of command and now you have people

1485
01:38:45.48 --> 01:38:50.12
doing things that they shouldn't be doing and and and and and I don't necessarily mean they're

1486
01:38:50.12 --> 01:38:54.36
doing something illegal I'm saying they're doing things that don't support the strategic goals of the company

1487
01:38:54.36 --> 01:39:02.84
and it's a problem but as those companies grow what they don't realize is just like this

1488
01:39:02.84 --> 01:39:08.36
book says you have more tools that you can put into place you've got it you've got to

1489
01:39:08.36 --> 01:39:14.44
communications department inside your company whose job is internal communications so you could

1490
01:39:14.44 --> 01:39:18.84
be making what you could be making videos and explain to people what's going on and given an update

1491
01:39:18.84 --> 01:39:25.16
you can you can do all those things you have that capability you have VTCs right you got video calls

1492
01:39:25.16 --> 01:39:29.80
you can make you you've got subordinate leadership that can go out there and get in the field

1493
01:39:29.80 --> 01:39:35.48
and make things known so there's a way to overcome these problems if you address them if you don't

1494
01:39:35.48 --> 01:39:41.32
address them and you can you think if you think you can keep leading a 2000 person organization

1495
01:39:41.32 --> 01:39:45.96
as if you were leading 20 people you're going to have a major issues and it's not going to work

1496
01:39:45.96 --> 01:39:52.76
it's not going to work back to the book over a period of time the leader will develop techniques of

1497
01:39:52.76 --> 01:39:57.16
his own which will be better suited to his own personality in which he himself will be able to

1498
01:39:57.16 --> 01:40:03.24
employ effectively so yeah you're all going to get your own little leadership techniques and what's

1499
01:40:03.24 --> 01:40:07.64
I'm telling you where I'm really lucky is I've worked with so many different leaders that I just

1500
01:40:07.64 --> 01:40:12.52
don't know my techniques I say hey you know what's a good thing to do here my buddy bill you

1501
01:40:12.52 --> 01:40:19.80
stabbing issue with us and you could you know so that's kind of nice now here are some

1502
01:40:20.68 --> 01:40:27.08
leadership techniques these are leadership techniques that apply back to these principles

1503
01:40:28.36 --> 01:40:31.48
these are applicable to all leaders okay so when it comes to knowing your job principle

1504
01:40:31.48 --> 01:40:36.04
I want to know your job seek a well-rounded military education through attendance at service schools

1505
01:40:36.04 --> 01:40:43.24
and through regular independent reading research and study so how do you know your job you study

1506
01:40:44.36 --> 01:40:47.72
another one keep abreast of the latest techniques in the field of communication or

1507
01:40:47.72 --> 01:40:54.28
facilitate control of your unit and disseminate information three seek out and foster association

1508
01:40:54.28 --> 01:41:00.28
with capable leaders observe and study their actions and application of leadership techniques

1509
01:41:00.28 --> 01:41:04.68
for broaden your field of knowledge through association with officers and men of other armed

1510
01:41:04.68 --> 01:41:13.24
services five seek the opportunity to apply knowledge through exercise a command real leadership is

1511
01:41:13.24 --> 01:41:19.72
acquired only through constant practice six avoid over specialization into narrow field seven

1512
01:41:19.72 --> 01:41:24.28
keep abreast of current military developments eight familiarize yourself with capabilities and

1513
01:41:24.28 --> 01:41:28.92
limitations of all elements of your command by study and through frequent visits to support

1514
01:41:28.92 --> 01:41:33.08
it's so that's cool know your job and I'll tell you what one thing that's impressive is I get

1515
01:41:33.08 --> 01:41:38.76
to work with a lot of leaders and some of these leaders come up through their industry and man

1516
01:41:38.76 --> 01:41:47.32
they are knowledgeable it's impressive it's impressive but where the shortfall is they're they're

1517
01:41:47.32 --> 01:41:54.36
super knowledgeable about their field but they don't have the leadership knowledge so

1518
01:41:55.32 --> 01:41:59.64
that's what's beneficial about things like this podcast like extreme worship like that

1519
01:41:59.64 --> 01:42:03.72
got to me leadership like putting this information where people can actually read it and understand

1520
01:42:03.72 --> 01:42:07.32
it they can study because they know their job they know their technical field you know that's

1521
01:42:07.32 --> 01:42:13.000
another thing with EF overwatch right now is like we're bringing in people that don't

1522
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:20.60
necessarily have the technical skill inside of a field but they have the leadership experience and

1523
01:42:20.60 --> 01:42:24.68
it's a lot easier to teach someone a technical skill that it is to teach the leadership because

1524
01:42:24.68 --> 01:42:29.48
to get leadership the only way you get better leadership is leadership.

1525
01:42:29.48 --> 01:42:35.96
So we're very it's been very successful so far and now we're starting to see employers

1526
01:42:35.96 --> 01:42:39.72
that say they were a little you know your hesitant because you think how do you know anything

1527
01:42:39.72 --> 01:42:44.76
about whatever I do know if how can someone that's not from this field lead in this field

1528
01:42:45.80 --> 01:42:51.88
give the person an overview of what the what the field is and then they take their 22 years

1529
01:42:51.88 --> 01:42:56.36
24 years 26 years of real leadership experience and they apply it.

1530
01:42:56.36 --> 01:43:01.56
It's kind of like taking human resource department a little bit in a small way.

1531
01:43:01.56 --> 01:43:02.76
What about it right like where?

1532
01:43:02.76 --> 01:43:08.60
What about HR HR yes they go you know you have this department that they don't know anything about

1533
01:43:08.60 --> 01:43:13.80
software or nothing like that they don't know about you know and that's big that's a big deal

1534
01:43:13.80 --> 01:43:15.96
when people are working together you know kind of thing.

1535
01:43:15.96 --> 01:43:18.12
Yeah good good analogy.

1536
01:43:19.16 --> 01:43:24.44
Okay here's some things some techniques for principle to know yourself and seek self improvement.

1537
01:43:24.44 --> 01:43:31.24
One analyze yourself objectively to determine the strong and weak points of your character.

1538
01:43:31.24 --> 01:43:36.44
You could make that into a little drill right actually look actually go down that list of

1539
01:43:36.44 --> 01:43:38.44
characteristics and say which where you at.

1540
01:43:40.44 --> 01:43:44.68
Two recognize your weak points and make an after overcome them three solicit when appropriate

1541
01:43:44.68 --> 01:43:48.36
the candidate opinions of others as to how you can make the most of your desirable

1542
01:43:48.36 --> 01:43:53.000
qualities and eliminate your undesirable ones. Be careful because when you ask that question

1543
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.88
if you ask it honestly you're going to get some answers you don't want to hear.

1544
01:43:55.88 --> 01:43:57.08
What your weak points?

1545
01:43:57.08 --> 01:43:59.64
Yeah all right and I want to hear about those weak points.

1546
01:43:59.64 --> 01:44:01.08
No not even from themselves.

1547
01:44:01.08 --> 01:44:08.28
No from themselves and it's it's so rare that someone truly wants to hear what they screw

1548
01:44:08.28 --> 01:44:11.64
up. It just doesn't hardly exist.

1549
01:44:11.64 --> 01:44:17.80
So so what that means is everyone knows that and since everyone knows that they are not

1550
01:44:17.80 --> 01:44:20.04
going to give you an honest feedback.

1551
01:44:20.04 --> 01:44:24.12
So when you say hey how did I do in that last task they go oh man you did good they're lying.

1552
01:44:25.96 --> 01:44:30.12
They're not even being tactful they're lying they're telling a lot they're telling a lie to you.

1553
01:44:30.12 --> 01:44:35.16
Because if they want to be tactful they get to be tactful and say hey you know what I know

1554
01:44:35.16 --> 01:44:41.32
was a tough project and you pulled it off which was commendable but there was some

1555
01:44:41.32 --> 01:44:45.88
definite errors for improvement and you know what luckily I kept a list. Let's go through it.

1556
01:44:46.60 --> 01:44:47.000
Boom.

1557
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:55.40
Next profit by studying the causes for past success or failure of other leaders past and

1558
01:44:55.40 --> 01:45:02.52
present. Develop a genuine interest in people acquire the human touch practice the golden

1559
01:45:02.52 --> 01:45:05.80
rule master the art of good writing and speaking.

1560
01:45:07.80 --> 01:45:13.24
How do you do that? Right and speak and read and listen.

1561
01:45:13.24 --> 01:45:20.84
And last one cultivate causal relations with members of other arms and services and with civilians.

1562
01:45:21.64 --> 01:45:23.88
Cool. That's how you get to know yourself.

1563
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:28.60
Some things some techniques for knowing you're knowing your men principle free.

1564
01:45:28.60 --> 01:45:33.96
Know your men and look out for their welfare. Number one see the members of your command and let them see you.

1565
01:45:35.24 --> 01:45:40.36
Stay locked up in the ivory tower. Be friendly and approachable.

1566
01:45:40.36 --> 01:45:47.000
Yeah. Important. Develop an intimate knowledge and understanding of your

1567
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:51.16
support. It's through personal contact and available records in small commands. It is imperative

1568
01:45:51.16 --> 01:45:56.04
not only that the leader know the name and address of his support. But also that he's familiar

1569
01:45:56.04 --> 01:46:00.92
with their characteristics. Cool. Know your people. Literally know your people.

1570
01:46:01.80 --> 01:46:05.24
Interest yourself in living conditions of the members of your command including their

1571
01:46:05.24 --> 01:46:11.32
family environment food clothing ability. Make ample provision for any give personal and visible

1572
01:46:11.32 --> 01:46:15.48
attention to the various personal services particularly those concerned with the personal

1573
01:46:15.48 --> 01:46:20.20
problems of individuals. Provide for the spiritual welfare of your command by supporting

1574
01:46:20.20 --> 01:46:26.36
religious activities protect the health of your command by active supervision of hygiene and sanitation.

1575
01:46:26.36 --> 01:46:30.76
Support actively a safety program determine the mental attitude of members of your command

1576
01:46:30.76 --> 01:46:36.44
by frequent informal visits and by using fully all available sources of information.

1577
01:46:38.20 --> 01:46:43.40
And minister justice impartially to all without fear or favor.

1578
01:46:44.68 --> 01:46:50.60
When punishment is necessary the commander should be fair, consistent, and impersonal

1579
01:46:50.60 --> 01:46:58.12
punishment, private with dignity and with human understanding. Never award a degrading punishment

1580
01:46:58.12 --> 01:47:05.56
avoid punishing a group for the faults of the individual. Always make the individual feel that

1581
01:47:05.56 --> 01:47:12.12
the punishment is temporary and that improvement is expected. I think when he says expected or

1582
01:47:12.12 --> 01:47:17.08
when they say expected I don't think they're talking about like I expect you do better. It's more

1583
01:47:17.08 --> 01:47:23.08
like hey man. I know you can do better. That's what they're talking about. And it's an interesting

1584
01:47:23.08 --> 01:47:26.60
one that avoid punishing a group for the fault of the individual because the military is famous for

1585
01:47:26.60 --> 01:47:32.20
doing that especially in like boot camps and areas where we're going to keep doing these until we

1586
01:47:32.20 --> 01:47:38.92
can all do them in unison, whatever jumping jacks. But beyond those scenarios that's not always the

1587
01:47:38.92 --> 01:47:44.76
best call to make. Yeah because that's like it's one of those people they do that too. Real

1588
01:47:45.80 --> 01:47:50.84
obvious. Like if you mess up everyone else does the bell, the bear crawls you know you and you

1589
01:47:50.84 --> 01:47:57.08
stand and watch because that's like a psychological punishment to the guy more than the team. Yeah.

1590
01:47:57.08 --> 01:48:01.88
So it's like it's like a different approach but yeah man I get it for that very reason by the way.

1591
01:48:01.88 --> 01:48:08.68
It works in the boot camp environment or the team training environment where you're trying to

1592
01:48:09.48 --> 01:48:19.32
create this overall cohesion by making everyone rely on each other and be able to count on each other.

1593
01:48:19.32 --> 01:48:26.04
Yeah as if to say in a demonstrable way like when you mess up this affects the team and put the

1594
01:48:26.04 --> 01:48:32.12
peer pressure on everyone to step up their game. Right? If we don't make this time, if everyone doesn't

1595
01:48:32.12 --> 01:48:36.36
make this time then we're all going to get punished. Okay so we don't want that on our backs.

1596
01:48:36.36 --> 01:48:41.96
Right. But when you get into a business situation you start punishing people for the group failure

1597
01:48:41.96 --> 01:48:47.80
that's that's not as effective in building in fact what they can do sometimes it starts

1598
01:48:47.80 --> 01:48:51.88
ripping things apart. So you're going to be careful with that one. Don't hate it, make a. Yeah.

1599
01:48:53.48 --> 01:48:58.68
Next, ensure fair and equitable distribution of privileges such as passes, leaves and rotation

1600
01:48:58.68 --> 01:49:02.76
and encourage educational development by providing educational opportunities for members of your command.

1601
01:49:04.76 --> 01:49:14.28
I often ask groups this leaders in companies I'll say who here had someone that truly

1602
01:49:14.28 --> 01:49:21.40
took a vested interest in you and helped you move up the ranks through the chain of command

1603
01:49:21.40 --> 01:49:27.96
in your industry and everyone will raise their hand just about 99% of people will raise their hand.

1604
01:49:27.96 --> 01:49:33.40
And I'll say how good did that feel one to ten to have someone that was completely invested in

1605
01:49:33.40 --> 01:49:40.36
helping you? Who's a nine or above everyone raise their hand? Imagine how good that feels when you

1606
01:49:40.36 --> 01:49:47.16
do that for someone else. Because it's really easy to forget that someone helped you. It's real

1607
01:49:47.16 --> 01:49:53.32
easy to forget that you got hoisted up to your position of power by other people that were willing

1608
01:49:53.32 --> 01:49:58.92
to sacrifice their time and their energy to improve your life. So when you get the opportunity to

1609
01:49:58.92 --> 01:50:06.68
improve someone else's life do it. Next, techniques for keeping your men informed,

1610
01:50:06.68 --> 01:50:14.28
explain to your principal support and it's why any particular task must be accomplished

1611
01:50:14.28 --> 01:50:17.72
and how you propose to it. So, importance of understanding why.

1612
01:50:17.72 --> 01:50:22.84
Assure yourself by frequent inspections and visits that support and it's our transmitting

1613
01:50:22.84 --> 01:50:28.60
necessary information to the men. So you just can't expect it. You got to inspect it.

1614
01:50:29.16 --> 01:50:33.08
Keep your principal support and it's informed of plans for future operations subject

1615
01:50:33.08 --> 01:50:37.000
only to security restrictions to disseminate information concerning the capabilities of our

1616
01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:42.84
weapons compared to those of an active or potential enemy where an enemy has an initial advantage,

1617
01:50:42.84 --> 01:50:48.12
show how this can be overcome. Be sure that troops are informed with the capabilities and limitations

1618
01:50:48.12 --> 01:50:54.12
of supporting units, arms and services, be alert to detect the spread of false rumors,

1619
01:50:55.32 --> 01:51:02.04
stop rumors by replacing them with the truth. Build confidence in a

1620
01:51:02.04 --> 01:51:06.76
free to core by exploiting all information concerning successes of the command.

1621
01:51:06.76 --> 01:51:11.40
That's a big one. There's a lot of times businesses companies, people, they do things,

1622
01:51:11.40 --> 01:51:15.40
things go well and they don't tell anybody about it and it gets lost. Whereas if you want to build

1623
01:51:15.40 --> 01:51:19.40
morale and you want to get momentum, you've got to tell everyone hey, we're out here and we're crushing

1624
01:51:19.40 --> 01:51:29.64
it. Principal, five, how to set the example. Number one, be it all times physically fit,

1625
01:51:29.64 --> 01:51:38.52
mentally alert, well groomed and correctly dressed. There you go. That's how you set the example.

1626
01:51:38.52 --> 01:51:46.52
Two, master your emotions. The commander who is subject to intemperate bursts of anger or

1627
01:51:46.52 --> 01:51:51.72
periods of depression will have difficulty in gaining and holding respect and loyalty of its

1628
01:51:51.72 --> 01:52:01.56
subordinates. Maintain an optimistic outlook. The will to win is infectious. The leader

1629
01:52:01.56 --> 01:52:06.52
fosters it by capitalizing on his units capabilities and successes not on his limitations

1630
01:52:06.52 --> 01:52:13.64
or failures. Maintain an air of outward calmness. The more difficult the situation, the more important

1631
01:52:13.64 --> 01:52:20.60
this becomes. So when things start going sideways, you got to stay calm. Conduct yourself so that

1632
01:52:20.60 --> 01:52:26.76
your personal habits are not open to censure. Course behavior and vulgarity are the marks of an

1633
01:52:26.76 --> 01:52:33.56
essentially weakened unstable character. These together with a failure to be punctual and a tendency

1634
01:52:33.56 --> 01:52:39.80
towards selfishness and self-indulgence in luxuries not available to the command in general

1635
01:52:39.80 --> 01:52:44.68
are inevitably resented by all ranks. So that's what we were just talking about. But yeah,

1636
01:52:44.68 --> 01:52:50.76
man, you got to hold yourself to a little higher standard. Maybe even a lot higher standard. Because

1637
01:52:50.76 --> 01:52:58.28
they're watching you. Cooperate in spirit as well as in fact, this is what I just talked about

1638
01:52:58.28 --> 01:53:03.32
and what we just talked about. It's not just hey, I'm pretending to do this because it's going to

1639
01:53:03.32 --> 01:53:09.80
make things easier for me and it's I truly am doing this. Cooperation must work in two directions.

1640
01:53:09.80 --> 01:53:15.96
It arises from a whole hearted desire by all members to further the effective operations of the team.

1641
01:53:18.92 --> 01:53:23.24
Exercise initiative and promote this spirit of initiative in your subordinates.

1642
01:53:24.52 --> 01:53:29.64
We can speak loosely loyal to those below you as well as those above you. Support those

1643
01:53:29.64 --> 01:53:35.16
under you as long as the individuals concerned have been discharging their duties competently.

1644
01:53:35.16 --> 01:53:41.64
The commander who seeks however to protect and incompetent subordinate from correction by a higher

1645
01:53:41.64 --> 01:53:47.96
commander is being disloyal himself. Loyalty is a prime trait of leadership and demands

1646
01:53:47.96 --> 01:53:53.32
unqualified support of the policies of the superior officers whether the individual concerned

1647
01:53:53.32 --> 01:53:57.72
personally favors them or not. That's the whole conversation we just had about loyalty.

1648
01:53:57.72 --> 01:54:02.92
Avoid the development of a click of favorites.

1649
01:54:04.36 --> 01:54:09.000
Walland is difficult to avoid. I like this one because they readily admit this is interesting.

1650
01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:13.64
So avoid the development of a click of favorites. But then they kind of throw this on there.

1651
01:54:13.64 --> 01:54:18.36
Walland is difficult to avoid being partial to subordinates who have rendered loyal and superior

1652
01:54:18.36 --> 01:54:24.44
service over a period of time that's a temptation to show partiality should be vigorously resisted.

1653
01:54:24.44 --> 01:54:28.44
So they're saying like, isn't it hard? Do you have somebody on your team that's just doing great things?

1654
01:54:28.44 --> 01:54:33.08
Yes, natural. I always had a hard time with that. Yeah, it makes sense.

1655
01:54:33.08 --> 01:54:38.76
I would be over about it. But if you were doing good, you're going to get some some bannies from

1656
01:54:38.76 --> 01:54:46.92
that. Yeah. Be morally courageous. The commander who fails to stand by his principles where the

1657
01:54:46.92 --> 01:54:52.12
welfare of his commanders concerned or who attempts to avoid responsibility for mistakes of his

1658
01:54:52.12 --> 01:54:56.52
command will fail to gain or hold respect of his associates or subordinates.

1659
01:54:58.28 --> 01:55:05.24
And the last one, share danger and hardship. A leader who has elements of his command subjected

1660
01:55:05.24 --> 01:55:10.28
to danger or to hardship of any kind should visit them as often as possible to demonstrate without

1661
01:55:10.28 --> 01:55:15.88
ostentation that his willingness to assume his share of the difficulties.

1662
01:55:15.88 --> 01:55:23.48
So those are some techniques for that. Principle six, how do we ensure that the task is

1663
01:55:23.48 --> 01:55:27.88
understood supervising the complex here are some techniques for that. Through study and practice

1664
01:55:27.88 --> 01:55:31.48
develop the ability to think clearly to issue a clear concise positive order.

1665
01:55:33.88 --> 01:55:38.92
Is it strange that I ended up using the word simple clear concise and they use the words,

1666
01:55:38.92 --> 01:55:41.80
I guess it's not that weird, but it's it's fun to see.

1667
01:55:41.80 --> 01:55:48.04
Hmm. To encourage subordinates to seek immediate clarification about any point in your orders or

1668
01:55:48.04 --> 01:55:53.48
directions that they do not understand perfectly. So that's something that so many people fail to do.

1669
01:55:54.28 --> 01:55:57.08
Is everyone just keeps their mouth shut? No, I don't know any questions.

1670
01:55:57.72 --> 01:56:04.76
So funny like these. This one really is seem so obvious. Like oh yeah, you're not clear. Like

1671
01:56:04.76 --> 01:56:07.48
oh what are you doing if you're not clear? It's this big mystery. What to do?

1672
01:56:07.48 --> 01:56:11.80
Everyone knows even if you're a kid that you know like oh I didn't understand that like what do you mean?

1673
01:56:11.80 --> 01:56:16.76
What do you mean? Why? Why are you in a kid's always asked why? Why? Why? Same thing. So it seems

1674
01:56:16.76 --> 01:56:22.04
super obvious, but yeah when you're in there you want to keep your mouth shut. There's all these different

1675
01:56:22.04 --> 01:56:27.72
human. Yeah, you don't want to look stupid. You don't want to open you know you don't want to be that guy.

1676
01:56:30.76 --> 01:56:36.60
Question your subordinates and assistance to determine if there's any doubt on misunderstanding to the

1677
01:56:36.60 --> 01:56:41.56
task so this is something that we always say. How do you know people understand? You ask them and

1678
01:56:41.56 --> 01:56:43.88
you just don't ask them do you understand? You ask them to explain it back to you.

1679
01:56:45.08 --> 01:56:50.12
Make every means available to your subordinates to assist them in accomplishing their mission.

1680
01:56:52.20 --> 01:56:56.52
Principle seven train your men as a team ensure by inspections and training tests that your

1681
01:56:56.52 --> 01:57:02.28
command is being trained in accordance with the training programs and doctrine prescribed by higher authority

1682
01:57:02.28 --> 01:57:07.72
make sure the best available facilities for team training are provided. Ensure that all

1683
01:57:07.72 --> 01:57:12.84
training is purposeful. Ensure that each element of the command is acquainted with the capabilities

1684
01:57:12.84 --> 01:57:18.60
and limitations of all other elements thereby developing mutual trust and understanding.

1685
01:57:19.96 --> 01:57:24.52
Ensure each subordinate leader understands the mechanics of tactical control for his own

1686
01:57:24.52 --> 01:57:32.36
national honor command predicate team training on modern realistic conditions.

1687
01:57:32.36 --> 01:57:38.12
Officer and enlisted man knows the functions of each other officer and enlisted man with whom

1688
01:57:38.12 --> 01:57:43.64
he abitually operates. Ensure that each of these no one understand each other their traits,

1689
01:57:43.64 --> 01:57:48.36
peculiarities, strengths and weaknesses. So often in companies this is not happening in businesses.

1690
01:57:48.36 --> 01:57:54.76
It happens pretty well in the military, but in businesses you have departments they have no idea

1691
01:57:54.76 --> 01:57:59.32
what another department does, no idea how they do their job, no idea what their job even entails.

1692
01:58:01.48 --> 01:58:08.44
Lafin I used to make team make teams brief what their department did and when we get them in

1693
01:58:08.44 --> 01:58:13.24
there in the room you'd see people had no idea what their teams were doing. They'd be odd and

1694
01:58:13.24 --> 01:58:22.20
you guys did that. Hello guys, we do that for nine years. Demand the highest standard of discipline

1695
01:58:22.20 --> 01:58:29.40
and teamwork in all training. We support that. Seas opportunity to train with other units both combat

1696
01:58:29.40 --> 01:58:35.80
and service. Principal eight makes sound and timely to the decisions. This first one here,

1697
01:58:35.80 --> 01:58:43.000
this is techniques again. Develop a logical and orderly thought process by constant practice

1698
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:48.52
in making objective estimates of the situation. Making an estimate is not restricted to the military

1699
01:58:48.52 --> 01:58:53.56
to employ it is employed in every day life of all persons. So how do you make decisions?

1700
01:58:54.52 --> 01:59:01.000
How do you do that? And then you come up with kind of a process that you flow through in your brain

1701
01:59:02.12 --> 01:59:08.60
after add that to the protocol book. How to make decisions. And so far as time and occasion

1702
01:59:08.60 --> 01:59:16.60
permit plan for every contingency that can reasonably be for scene. Consider the advice and suggestions

1703
01:59:16.60 --> 01:59:21.80
of your subordinates before making your decisions. Of course, announced decisions in time to allow

1704
01:59:21.80 --> 01:59:28.60
subordinates to make necessary plans. Boom. Principal nine is seek responsibility and develop

1705
01:59:28.60 --> 01:59:33.72
a sense of responsibility among the subordinates. So this one says, learn the duties and

1706
01:59:33.72 --> 01:59:38.84
responsibility of your immediate supervisor. I actually think you learn your immediate supervisor

1707
01:59:38.84 --> 01:59:44.20
and his boss. You want at least know what's going on. Seek diversified assignments which will

1708
01:59:44.20 --> 01:59:48.76
give you responsibility and command experience. People always want to stay and do keep doing what

1709
01:59:48.76 --> 01:59:54.04
they're good at. They want to venture out into the different world. Take advantage of any

1710
01:59:54.04 --> 01:59:59.48
opportunity which offers increased responsibility. Do that. Oh, this is a task that needs to be

1711
01:59:59.48 --> 02:00:07.96
done. Someone needs to run it. I got it. I'm on it. Perform every task larger small to the best of

1712
02:00:07.96 --> 02:00:15.56
your ability. And this goes back to whatever a few podcasts go we were talking about. How you do

1713
02:00:15.56 --> 02:00:22.20
anything is how you do everything. And I gave some slack on that one. But these guys got no slack at all.

1714
02:00:22.20 --> 02:00:28.36
Perform every task larger small to the best of your ability. Your reward will consist of increased

1715
02:00:28.36 --> 02:00:34.04
opportunity to demonstrate your fitness to perform bigger and more important tasks. What does that

1716
02:00:34.04 --> 02:00:37.56
mean? The better you do, the more work you're going to get. That's what it means.

1717
02:00:40.04 --> 02:00:48.20
Oh, tell your subordinates what to do, not how to do it. Hold them responsible for the results,

1718
02:00:48.20 --> 02:00:53.80
delegate and supervise but do not intervene except when urgently necessary. Avoid

1719
02:00:53.80 --> 02:01:01.88
you surfing the prerogatives of your subordinates. This is actually such a concise, clear,

1720
02:01:03.24 --> 02:01:10.04
rule. Tell your subordinates what to do, not how to do it. Hold them responsible for the results,

1721
02:01:10.04 --> 02:01:18.44
delegate and supervise but do not intervene except when urgently necessary. Avoid you surfing

1722
02:01:18.44 --> 02:01:24.60
the prerogatives of your subordinates. That is really good advice for anyone in a leadership position.

1723
02:01:24.60 --> 02:01:27.80
If you could follow that advice right there your world is going to be so much better.

1724
02:01:28.84 --> 02:01:33.48
Provide all personnel with frequent opportunities to perform duties of the next higher

1725
02:01:33.48 --> 02:01:39.40
echelon. Yes. To you, Bruser, we made all the junior officers be ground force commanders before

1726
02:01:39.40 --> 02:01:45.16
everyone oversees. Got no experience and then they went overseas and did it. Be quick to recognize

1727
02:01:45.16 --> 02:01:48.76
accomplishments of your subordinates when they demonstrate initiative and resourcefulness,

1728
02:01:48.76 --> 02:01:53.48
correct errors in the use of judgment and initiative in such a way as to encourage the individual.

1729
02:01:54.52 --> 02:02:01.40
Avoid public criticism or condemnation. Be liberal, however, and openly giving praise for which

1730
02:02:01.40 --> 02:02:10.20
is deserved. Give unstintingly help. Give unstintingly of help and advice when you are

1731
02:02:10.20 --> 02:02:15.64
requested by those under your command. That one is pretty obvious. Ensure that your personnel are

1732
02:02:15.64 --> 02:02:21.08
assigned positions commensurate with demonstrated or potential ability. That's important.

1733
02:02:21.08 --> 02:02:27.56
Got someone that's got some potential? Put them in a good spot. Be prompt and fair in

1734
02:02:27.56 --> 02:02:35.24
backing subordinates to the limit until convinced otherwise have faith in each subordinate.

1735
02:02:35.24 --> 02:02:41.48
I think you got to take a little time to make sure you build that up. You don't dive in with

1736
02:02:41.48 --> 02:02:47.08
complete faith. Give a little task first. Demonstrate to your command that you are ready and

1737
02:02:47.08 --> 02:02:56.92
willing to accept responsibility. Yes. Ownership. Principle 10. Techniques on how to employ

1738
02:02:58.76 --> 02:03:05.000
your command in accordance with its capabilities. Number one, no understand and apply the principles

1739
02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:10.12
of war. And those principles of war are different than what we're talking about right now.

1740
02:03:11.08 --> 02:03:17.32
The principles of war that they're talking about are objective, offense, mass, economy,

1741
02:03:17.32 --> 02:03:23.48
force, maneuver, unity of command, security, surprise and simplicity. Those are the

1742
02:03:25.08 --> 02:03:30.36
principles of war that they're talking about. You've got to know those. So that means in

1743
02:03:30.36 --> 02:03:36.44
your company, you've got to understand the principles that you're operating in. Keep yourself

1744
02:03:36.44 --> 02:03:42.20
informed as to the relative operational effectiveness of various elements of your command.

1745
02:03:43.08 --> 02:03:47.16
Be sure the tasks assigned are reasonably possible of accomplishment,

1746
02:03:48.20 --> 02:03:52.68
analyze any task assigned. If it means you're disposable, if it means that you're disposable

1747
02:03:52.68 --> 02:03:56.92
up here inadequate of informed inform your immediate commander in request additional means.

1748
02:03:56.92 --> 02:04:02.52
Yeah, it's not like, oh, I'll get anything done, boss. I can do anything. No, actually, I'm going

1749
02:04:02.52 --> 02:04:05.96
to need some more support over here. I need some more people, money, resources, whatever.

1750
02:04:07.24 --> 02:04:12.36
Make every effort to equalize tasks proportionally over appropriate periods of time

1751
02:04:12.36 --> 02:04:20.84
among the several elements of your command. Don't just lay down one group. If you got one

1752
02:04:20.84 --> 02:04:26.92
group that's so much stronger than the other group, moves and people around. So you get some equality

1753
02:04:26.92 --> 02:04:34.44
there. And here's the last principle, techniques. Take responsibility for your actions, principle 11.

1754
02:04:36.04 --> 02:04:41.64
Extreme ownership. Remember that you are responsible for all your command does or fails to do

1755
02:04:41.64 --> 02:04:50.60
except justified criticism at here to what you think is right and have courage of your convictions.

1756
02:04:52.76 --> 02:05:02.52
So those are some heavy hitters. What this book does now and I'm not going to do it is it

1757
02:05:02.52 --> 02:05:09.88
actually breaks down how what different leadership techniques you can use at every level.

1758
02:05:09.88 --> 02:05:16.52
So it talks about and you know what? I haven't said this yet. This book is free. This is online. You

1759
02:05:16.52 --> 02:05:25.88
can Google 1951 Leadership FM 10.22. What is that? Uh, like a PDF? Yeah, that's like a PDF.

1760
02:05:26.60 --> 02:05:31.72
And so you can you can look it up and you can figure out where you are. It talks about

1761
02:05:31.72 --> 02:05:36.44
technique useful to non-commissioned officers. It talks about techniques for

1762
02:05:36.44 --> 02:05:43.40
uh, regimental and lower unit commanders. It talks about commanders of divisions

1763
02:05:44.44 --> 02:05:49.64
and higher units and it goes through what kind of techniques you can use in each one of these positions.

1764
02:05:49.64 --> 02:05:58.28
And they're all solid information, solid information. And points out good, not just what the rules

1765
02:05:58.28 --> 02:06:09.72
are, but the techniques that are used to to kind of make them happen. And so solid bunch of

1766
02:06:09.72 --> 02:06:14.76
information there that again, you can easily get this book as a pretty short read. I've read a

1767
02:06:14.76 --> 02:06:21.72
bunch of it right now. I mean, I actually kind of went crazy with my red with my red pen just circling

1768
02:06:21.72 --> 02:06:30.04
everything and saying, hey, read this too. But there's a ton of it in here. But I'm going to skip

1769
02:06:30.04 --> 02:06:35.88
back to, um, let's skip that information, look it up, go read it. It's powerful stuff. And I'm going

1770
02:06:35.88 --> 02:06:40.68
to kind of just jump ahead to this last little closing part that I wanted to cover, which is talking

1771
02:06:40.68 --> 02:06:48.76
about how to train. And it just talks about a few things stress realism. Because we have to make

1772
02:06:48.76 --> 02:06:54.76
training realistic that's what we have to do. It's what I did when I was in the SEAL teams. It's what

1773
02:06:54.76 --> 02:06:59.80
you should do in whatever kind of organization you're in. If you're in a business, you should

1774
02:06:59.80 --> 02:07:08.20
simulate, make your training as close to real as you possibly can. Another thing is require repeated

1775
02:07:08.20 --> 02:07:13.56
drills in the execution of simple tactical maneuvers. What does that mean? Repetition counts.

1776
02:07:13.56 --> 02:07:21.000
You have to repeat things over and over again if you want to get good at them. Another important

1777
02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:27.000
training tips stress the importance of each leader, so placing himself and his headquarters

1778
02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:32.60
that he can most readily coordinate all efforts of his command and of the elements that may be

1779
02:07:32.60 --> 02:07:40.68
supporting it. Where you're located is important. Where you position yourself is important. And so

1780
02:07:40.68 --> 02:07:44.52
you've got to recognize that that's going to change depending on the situation. You've got to learn

1781
02:07:44.52 --> 02:07:53.72
how to address that and how to pick the right spot to be in. And the last one is last couple

1782
02:07:53.72 --> 02:08:00.44
are stress the importance of exchange of information by all appropriate means. So we've got to communicate

1783
02:08:00.44 --> 02:08:11.24
and the last one is have a well planned critique immediately after each field exercise. And that

1784
02:08:12.12 --> 02:08:21.24
again wraps up this very, very powerful summation, very simple, very straightforward.

1785
02:08:22.92 --> 02:08:26.92
I feel like I actually could have talked about each one of these points

1786
02:08:26.92 --> 02:08:36.20
and gone over examples that because each one of them is so important. So I don't know, maybe we'll

1787
02:08:36.20 --> 02:08:44.44
do it again. Or they'll come up again. But that's Jeff. And then just that closing point on having

1788
02:08:44.44 --> 02:08:49.88
it well planned critique after every field exercise. What does that actually mean? What that means is

1789
02:08:49.88 --> 02:09:00.20
always be learning. It means always be learning. And almost every one of these principles I

1790
02:09:00.20 --> 02:09:05.88
recognized I have heard before. I've definitely read it before. We've covered them here before. But

1791
02:09:06.84 --> 02:09:11.80
I'm still trying to learn. I'm trying to still try to relearn even the same lessons.

1792
02:09:11.80 --> 02:09:21.08
After years of me looking at this stuff, which I guess is me just kind of following the principles

1793
02:09:21.08 --> 02:09:24.68
themselves, which is no your job, no yourself, and see improvements. That's what I'm trying to do.

1794
02:09:24.68 --> 02:09:29.48
And I think that's pretty much what anyone that's listening to this is trying to do.

1795
02:09:32.04 --> 02:09:39.80
So I mean I guess echo speaking of rule number two and speaking of us seeking to constantly improve

1796
02:09:39.80 --> 02:09:47.96
ourselves. What do you know about things that can help us improve our situation?

1797
02:09:49.64 --> 02:09:55.40
Support what we're trying to do in our self improvement journey.

1798
02:09:55.40 --> 02:10:02.76
Journey. Path, path, big time. And actually you can support this podcast. If you want to

1799
02:10:02.76 --> 02:10:13.80
do while you support your own journey down the path of discipline and keep in mind this path

1800
02:10:13.80 --> 02:10:20.84
that we are on also brings along others even if they're not like on the path with you.

1801
02:10:20.84 --> 02:10:27.88
Your results of being on the path improve them as well. I found that out directly. How many

1802
02:10:27.88 --> 02:10:33.32
capacities? Let's say in a sense that's one of those statements that you make where you're

1803
02:10:33.32 --> 02:10:37.48
just wanting a prompt so you can tell a long story. That's what it's out of.

1804
02:10:37.48 --> 02:10:42.12
You already said how do you know how to use the book?

1805
02:10:42.12 --> 02:10:49.96
Not in. In a family household, in a group setting or whatever, things can get stressful.

1806
02:10:49.96 --> 02:10:54.92
I'm not saying they're stressful every single day every moment but they can get stressful.

1807
02:10:54.92 --> 02:10:59.48
You know like any, you know about stressful situations. I must say a little bit.

1808
02:10:59.48 --> 02:11:09.56
So when everyone's panicking or whatever, stress out or whatever. You get one guy who jumps in there

1809
02:11:10.68 --> 02:11:19.40
the situation. Not panicking. Not overtly stressed out and he can sort of manage not only himself

1810
02:11:19.40 --> 02:11:25.000
but his tiny environment. It's contagious. Other people will get that and they start doing that as well.

1811
02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:29.48
Whether it be in the immediate situation or just in general. We just covered this as part of the book.

1812
02:11:29.48 --> 02:11:33.56
Oh yeah. Big time. How that leads first of all the leader can come from any rank

1813
02:11:34.28 --> 02:11:40.44
and then when they step in that leadership and the way that they act will spread throughout.

1814
02:11:40.44 --> 02:11:49.40
It's deep. Oh yeah. So you're confirming big time and that goes for a big time.

1815
02:11:49.40 --> 02:11:56.60
So if you're getting in shape, the people around you will sort of notice. If you're like

1816
02:11:56.60 --> 02:12:03.08
happier doing things more, make getting more done around you. Taking responsibility for things.

1817
02:12:04.28 --> 02:12:08.04
You're taking out the trash every other night, man. Whenever it fills up.

1818
02:12:08.04 --> 02:12:12.60
I don't know when it depends on big your your trash is like, yes, but if you're taking it out

1819
02:12:13.40 --> 02:12:20.04
when it's full, you don't let it overflow anymore. People notice that. I'm just saying. And

1820
02:12:21.08 --> 02:12:25.16
slowly by slowly, especially if you're happier, you know, if you're treating them better.

1821
02:12:25.16 --> 02:12:29.40
All this stuff, they'll start doing it too. Same thing with extreme ownership. You know,

1822
02:12:29.40 --> 02:12:35.32
I like to, you know, if you come at a problem, like, hey, that was my fault. It most of the time.

1823
02:12:35.32 --> 02:12:39.08
Eventually, if not immediately, they'll say, well, you know what, it's kind of, it's my fault. Yeah.

1824
02:12:39.80 --> 02:12:45.40
Same, same exact thing. So that's why you should be on the path and stay on the path.

1825
02:12:45.80 --> 02:12:49.64
Because you're not just helping yourself. You're helping everyone around you. So you are.

1826
02:12:50.44 --> 02:12:55.48
One of those things that you're doing on top of taking out the trash when it needs to be taken out

1827
02:12:55.48 --> 02:13:01.88
is due to. No. Here's that's it. It's kind of, due to one of these ones where people might not

1828
02:13:01.88 --> 02:13:06.68
write, especially if you're okay, your husband, you want to do jiu-jitsu now. But wait, we have a family

1829
02:13:06.68 --> 02:13:12.36
of six or more, whatever, or less, I don't know. And you have responsibilities in there. Now you

1830
02:13:12.36 --> 02:13:18.28
want to add this quote unquote extra curricular activity to these tasks. That's what you're telling.

1831
02:13:18.28 --> 02:13:23.08
Right? That's the situation, right? But like I said, when you get the benefits of

1832
02:13:23.08 --> 02:13:28.84
jiu-jitsu, you come home. You slowly become a different person. A better person, a better person.

1833
02:13:28.84 --> 02:13:34.52
Yeah. Right? Better person in the household is a better situation. So for everyone in the household.

1834
02:13:34.52 --> 02:13:39.80
Everybody and the neighbors. And the neighborhood. Your whole street, your old town.

1835
02:13:40.60 --> 02:13:45.40
The whole world is better for you. Jiu-jitsu. Your old, yes. There it is. And when you do jiu-jitsu,

1836
02:13:45.40 --> 02:13:51.24
you will need a key and a rash card. At least one, I think. Yeah. What are the best keys in the

1837
02:13:51.24 --> 02:13:56.36
whole wide world? They are origin keys. Origin keys by far. They are made in America. 100%

1838
02:13:56.36 --> 02:14:01.000
it. Sometimes people actually know about the keys, but people still ask. You know, some people

1839
02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:05.08
will be like, they don't like, they start training and they don't like it. Don't like, oh,

1840
02:14:05.08 --> 02:14:12.20
would you just say, yeah. Yeah. It's some people realize immediately like they get submitted.

1841
02:14:12.20 --> 02:14:16.28
They're like, you know, they'll pull their post up on Twitter. And they'll say,

1842
02:14:16.92 --> 02:14:22.28
I did my first jiu-jitsu class yesterday. I got submitted and beat up and I got submitted by a

1843
02:14:22.28 --> 02:14:28.84
15 year old girl. It's the best thing ever, right? Some people say that. Yeah. Because I think we are

1844
02:14:28.84 --> 02:14:34.36
doing a good job of setting the expectations of the fact that it's gonna, you're gonna get

1845
02:14:34.36 --> 02:14:39.56
humbled. They won. You're gonna get humbled. I actually don't care who you are. Yeah.

1846
02:14:40.36 --> 02:14:44.92
You're gonna get humbled. Because even if you're a D1 wrestler, you're gonna come in there.

1847
02:14:44.92 --> 02:14:47.80
And it's gonna be humbling because you're not gonna be able to quite do what you think you're

1848
02:14:47.80 --> 02:14:52.60
gonna do. Yeah. I mean, you'll be able to take someone down. You'll be able to, you'll be up.

1849
02:14:52.60 --> 02:14:55.56
But you won't be able to make them tap. You won't really know how to. I mean, if I'm a

1850
02:14:55.56 --> 02:14:59.32
person, it doesn't know anything. But if you're going against a blue belt or a purple belt,

1851
02:15:00.36 --> 02:15:06.20
gonna be hard for you. Yeah. So my first, it was like, it was technically, I guess, my first or

1852
02:15:06.20 --> 02:15:10.68
second day in a class setting. It wasn't with Dean. You know, I tried like two other gyms

1853
02:15:11.24 --> 02:15:15.64
before I joined with Dean. And I went and they were like, yeah, you know, I literally

1854
02:15:15.64 --> 02:15:19.24
won't do you two classes. I learned, I don't even remember what it was. So they're like,

1855
02:15:19.24 --> 02:15:24.36
hey, roll, now it's time to roll. So I'm going, I'm going into that way smaller than me. And it was

1856
02:15:24.36 --> 02:15:29.64
like within, he had like a month, I think a month experience. I'm you, I'm way bigger than

1857
02:15:29.64 --> 02:15:36.52
this guy. And he was thinking, like, you're example, he didn't tap me out, but I literally couldn't do

1858
02:15:36.52 --> 02:15:41.96
anything. Yeah. Gas and I'm so tired. I'm huge. I'm like, 225 solid. Like solid. Like, I can't get

1859
02:15:41.96 --> 02:15:48.76
no. He's in, he's 150. Here's a, it's about 150. Yes. And so here's the thing. He's like a month or two

1860
02:15:48.76 --> 02:15:53.80
in. It's a complete white belt too. But I'm like new guy. But I'm lame. We're at like literally,

1861
02:15:53.80 --> 02:15:58.36
I could pick this guy up over my head. Literally couldn't do nothing. Couldn't even pass his guard.

1862
02:15:58.36 --> 02:16:02.04
And I knew what a guard pad. I knew like you have to pass this guy's there. And he was telling

1863
02:16:02.04 --> 02:16:06.04
and he told me afterwards, he was like, hey, like you're, you're expanding to my channel to you all

1864
02:16:06.04 --> 02:16:09.40
this stuff. Whatever. And I'm thinking of my head, but I don't, I don't know that. I mean,

1865
02:16:09.40 --> 02:16:14.84
obviously because I'm tired. But it just goes to show how much you just don't know about when you're

1866
02:16:14.84 --> 02:16:19.24
going. Even though you're, you're, you're big and strong. Whatever. So yes, you will get a whole

1867
02:16:19.24 --> 02:16:25.40
whole. Yeah. You, so expect that part of it. And then instead of when you do get beat up,

1868
02:16:25.40 --> 02:16:30.92
when you get choke, when you get arm lock, instead of getting mad and thinking, I'm never going to

1869
02:16:30.92 --> 02:16:37.32
do this again. Think to yourself, I'm going to do this a lot until I can get good enough that some

1870
02:16:37.32 --> 02:16:45.40
unknown person can really impose their will on me as a human being. I didn't like that feeling,

1871
02:16:45.40 --> 02:16:51.96
man. Yeah. So yeah, it just goes to show like that. It matters what response you have to it. That's

1872
02:16:51.96 --> 02:16:56.84
like the what really matters. So yeah, we are all going to get beat up. We're all going to get

1873
02:16:56.84 --> 02:17:02.44
submitted multiple, when I say multiple, probably thousands. Yeah. By people were smaller.

1874
02:17:02.44 --> 02:17:06.52
Yeah. What do you think you want to start? You get submitted 10 times a day. When you start?

1875
02:17:06.52 --> 02:17:11.16
Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. So you're getting submitted 50 times a week if you're training five days a week.

1876
02:17:11.16 --> 02:17:15.80
Yeah. But you're so small and you're bigger than you smell and whoever all different people. So yeah.

1877
02:17:15.80 --> 02:17:18.60
So how are you going to respond? Are you going to respond by saying, I never want that experience

1878
02:17:18.60 --> 02:17:24.44
every again, ever again, or are you just wanting to be with, I want that skill. Whatever this guy

1879
02:17:24.44 --> 02:17:30.44
obviously has or the all these people obviously have got it from this place by the way. I know that too.

1880
02:17:30.44 --> 02:17:34.76
Yeah. Am I going to choose to be there? I don't know. I don't want that skill. There's not

1881
02:17:34.76 --> 02:17:40.84
about it somewhere. You don't have to go to like some other country. Yeah. And generally in America,

1882
02:17:41.24 --> 02:17:47.80
you can just go down, you can Google Maps and you can find nine digits of schools. Well,

1883
02:17:47.80 --> 02:17:52.20
maybe not. Maybe around in San Diego, you can. So the California can. If you're in another part of

1884
02:17:52.20 --> 02:17:57.56
the country, you can probably find two. You try two options where you are most likely. Now you could be

1885
02:17:57.56 --> 02:18:03.64
way out in the middle, nowhere. Cool. Get some mats, get some friends, get one of those online programs,

1886
02:18:03.64 --> 02:18:09.24
start learning, go to YouTube, YouTube's free to start listening what they're saying and trying it on

1887
02:18:09.24 --> 02:18:17.08
your buddies. And you'll start to learn GJT-Z. Yeah. Boom. On the path. GJT-Z. Get your get an origin

1888
02:18:17.08 --> 02:18:24.68
G, 100% made in America. Yeah. Good G. Here's the engineered for GJT-Z. Yeah. Quality. Great train was

1889
02:18:24.68 --> 02:18:30.36
commenting on his new origin G. The new one. He was like, oh, it's like a pearl. It's like a thing. And

1890
02:18:30.36 --> 02:18:35.80
he doesn't like geek out over that kind of stuff. Typically, but he was in for good reason. Yeah.

1891
02:18:35.80 --> 02:18:40.44
And you know, you kind of gloss over like Made in America. That's actually a really big deal.

1892
02:18:40.44 --> 02:18:50.84
It's actually bringing back an industry that had left that had left this country and bringing it back

1893
02:18:50.84 --> 02:18:57.56
where we are. We've hired the people that got left behind. They're not left behind anymore.

1894
02:18:57.56 --> 02:19:03.88
They're up there. They're making the best GEEZ in the world in a small town in New England.

1895
02:19:03.88 --> 02:19:11.08
Bringing back that economy. Yeah. So when you support origin, you're actually supporting

1896
02:19:11.08 --> 02:19:16.60
much more than GJT-Z. You're supporting much more than this podcast. You're actually supporting

1897
02:19:16.60 --> 02:19:22.76
America and you're supporting the working people of America. That's what you're doing. So we're

1898
02:19:22.76 --> 02:19:30.76
going to try and continue to drive down this path to continue to grow this company where we can bring

1899
02:19:30.76 --> 02:19:41.40
significant amount of jobs back to America, employ more people and let other people grow and

1900
02:19:41.40 --> 02:19:45.88
pay and provide for their families. That's what the goal is. And it feels great to go up to Farmington

1901
02:19:45.88 --> 02:19:55.08
and be there in the factory and see what is being made by this tradition of craftsmanship.

1902
02:19:56.12 --> 02:20:02.60
And you know, right now we're bringing on the shoes, the boots, and the same thing. We got people

1903
02:20:02.60 --> 02:20:09.24
that haven't been able to work in this industry for 12 years since they shut down the factories up there

1904
02:20:09.24 --> 02:20:14.52
and outsourced the jobs and sent the machines overseas. That's what actually happened.

1905
02:20:14.52 --> 02:20:24.84
So it actually happened. And the people talk about the corporate greed, right? Hey, it's going

1906
02:20:24.84 --> 02:20:29.48
to cost me whatever it's going to cost me. I can save a little bit of money by shipping these things

1907
02:20:29.48 --> 02:20:37.24
overseas. We'll let all these people go and that's fine. I don't care. Well, we do care. We do care.

1908
02:20:37.24 --> 02:20:41.88
And we recognize that the strength of America comes from our economy and the strength of our

1909
02:20:41.88 --> 02:20:47.80
economy comes from the ability of our of the working people in America to have a job and work hard

1910
02:20:47.80 --> 02:20:52.20
and make the best product in the world. That's what we're doing. Yeah, and it's man and over all

1911
02:20:52.20 --> 02:20:56.84
the repeat has that cool little series where it'll sort of it'll show the little inside. Yeah.

1912
02:20:56.84 --> 02:21:01.08
So you say, yeah, we have this problem. So I'm I think I'm going to call this guy and this guy

1913
02:21:01.08 --> 02:21:06.28
he's talking about is the old school expert who, you know, like he doesn't do it anymore.

1914
02:21:06.28 --> 02:21:13.000
But he has all this knowledge. He comes in boom, boom, solving problems. And then and it shows

1915
02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:17.64
the interaction between like the workers and Pete and like everybody, right? So it's not like this,

1916
02:21:17.64 --> 02:21:22.28
I mean, no offense to China, but it's not like your typical go to China and you turn it

1917
02:21:22.28 --> 02:21:27.24
burn these things, you know, no defects or whatever. Yeah, that video series is called origin

1918
02:21:27.24 --> 02:21:33.40
HD. What's the name of the of the YouTube channels? I think it's origin B JJ. So if you go to that,

1919
02:21:33.40 --> 02:21:41.32
you can get behind the scenes on what's being made on who's making it on on the kind of effort

1920
02:21:41.32 --> 02:21:48.60
that the team up in origin is putting in to make the quality that's up there. It's it's awesome to

1921
02:21:48.60 --> 02:21:53.80
watch. It's awesome to watch. So that they got a bunch of clothes up there too. Rashcards,

1922
02:21:55.48 --> 02:22:00.68
you know, t-shirts and all that. You can get from origin. We also, we yeah. And now we have genes

1923
02:22:00.68 --> 02:22:07.32
which are going to be live like this week. We have, we're their introduction. We hired a bunch of

1924
02:22:07.32 --> 02:22:14.76
people, a bunch of more people. So don't just run out and buy a pair of jeans made in China by

1925
02:22:14.76 --> 02:22:21.08
somebody in a sweatshop, buy a pair of jeans here that are made in America from the dirt

1926
02:22:21.08 --> 02:22:29.32
until they're on your legs, all that made in America. So yeah, you can get that. We also have

1927
02:22:29.32 --> 02:22:39.24
supplements, supplements that I basically wanted to make exactly how I wanted them. That's basically

1928
02:22:39.24 --> 02:22:44.44
what they are. Yeah. Basically my saying, hey, this is what has always worked for me. These things

1929
02:22:44.44 --> 02:22:52.12
put them together, combine them and make them. And also, by the way, if it's something that I'm

1930
02:22:52.12 --> 02:22:55.88
going to eat, make it taste good. And here's how we're going to do it. We're going to sweeten it

1931
02:22:55.88 --> 02:23:05.64
with monk fruit, which is a fruit, obviously. It's not a camp. There's not some, you know,

1932
02:23:05.64 --> 02:23:11.08
group of whatever scientists in a laboratory trying to create something that tastes good through

1933
02:23:11.08 --> 02:23:15.32
a bunch of cancer, causing crap. No, they're taking a fruit, putting it in there. That's why

1934
02:23:15.32 --> 02:23:22.84
milk tastes so good. Is there any better way to get additional needed protein? No, there is

1935
02:23:22.84 --> 02:23:31.24
not no better way. Now my house where I live, where my family, now it's who can make the best

1936
02:23:31.24 --> 02:23:37.80
milkshake. Right? I mean, my wife comes in the other day. She's holding the cob. And she's like,

1937
02:23:37.80 --> 02:23:44.92
she let's be tasting. I'm like, what in God's name? It's so good. It's so good. I don't even want to eat

1938
02:23:44.92 --> 02:23:55.56
anything else. It was coconut milk, vanilla gorilla, three ice cubes, one chunk like a quarter of a banana.

1939
02:23:56.12 --> 02:24:04.68
That thing tasted like a gourmet dessert, but donkiness. If you, um, this is a little added thing.

1940
02:24:04.68 --> 02:24:11.08
I put some, um, like MCT oil and coconut oil, you know, like just a little bit, not like too much

1941
02:24:11.08 --> 02:24:17.08
with ever. And it's weird. So it, it more adds to the texture than it does the taste, but that's like a

1942
02:24:17.08 --> 02:24:22.36
little sneaky way to make your taste more quality than the other competitors. It's ridiculous.

1943
02:24:22.36 --> 02:24:27.40
That could be good for you. It is. Because you feel like you're just eight in ice cream.

1944
02:24:27.40 --> 02:24:33.000
Shake. Right? But you didn't. You got high quality protein. You got probiotics.

1945
02:24:34.36 --> 02:24:38.28
Oh, it's getting good. It's a sneaky thing you do with your kids. By the way, you can use where you

1946
02:24:38.28 --> 02:24:44.60
could milk to whatever, whatever. By the way, strawberry, strawberry milk for adults is coming.

1947
02:24:44.60 --> 02:24:49.96
It should be out pretty soon. And I've tried it. It's, it's, it's absolutely completely and

1948
02:24:49.96 --> 02:24:54.76
utterly ridiculous how to get a taste. And that can be good for you. Yeah. It's totally ridiculous.

1949
02:24:54.76 --> 02:25:01.000
Did they send you a sample of it? Of the, of the strawberry, adult milk? Oh, no, no, no, no.

1950
02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:06.28
It's, I can't believe it. Okay. So anyways, there you go. So what you do with your kids is,

1951
02:25:06.28 --> 02:25:10.28
you know how you got to threaten them with punishment. Everyone's, I'll say, hey, no dessert.

1952
02:25:10.28 --> 02:25:14.28
Or you want to use it as an incentive. Like, hey, if you can clean up your room within the next,

1953
02:25:14.28 --> 02:25:18.92
you know, three minutes or whatever, you can have a mole. I'll give you, yeah, yeah. So I don't even say

1954
02:25:18.92 --> 02:25:22.60
malt, I'll just go. I'll make you a, unless they already know. Unless they're in the know,

1955
02:25:22.60 --> 02:25:28.44
then, but you say, I'll give you a special dessert or treat or whatever. You make it with the

1956
02:25:28.44 --> 02:25:34.28
mole. You put the little bit of empty deal. You know, you make it taste all gourmet the way you did.

1957
02:25:34.28 --> 02:25:37.32
So boom, they clean up their room within three minutes, by the way,

1958
02:25:37.32 --> 02:25:43.88
whenever time parameters you, you give them. They get the mole all thinking they won. They won the game.

1959
02:25:43.88 --> 02:25:48.44
Yeah, yeah. You know, I did that little task. You told me, you know, I, and I, and I saved the, the deal.

1960
02:25:48.44 --> 02:25:53.48
Right, got my dessert. You won the game. And that's the, they won.

1961
02:25:53.48 --> 02:25:58.68
We are the whole team one. I like it. Don't forget about joint warfare in

1962
02:25:58.68 --> 02:26:05.32
Criollo recently, Lave Babin, forgot about joint warfare. And he got off the mat. He, he,

1963
02:26:05.32 --> 02:26:09.32
texted me, he's like, bro, I didn't take joint warfare for like three days for whatever he's

1964
02:26:09.32 --> 02:26:15.72
traveling or wants something. And he's like, I got done rolling in us. Man, why am I so jacked up? Oh,

1965
02:26:15.72 --> 02:26:20.04
yeah, because I haven't taken any joint warfare. Got back on the joint warfare back on the good

1966
02:26:20.04 --> 02:26:25.64
to go train. Yeah. Yeah, and which was ironic. And I addressed this on that, uh, there was a post

1967
02:26:25.64 --> 02:26:31.24
that he made is out. Yeah, my post. Yeah. So I mean, we posted it because he was like, I can't even

1968
02:26:31.24 --> 02:26:37.16
believe this. It's ridiculous. Yeah. The, the difference that you notice. Yeah. And like I said,

1969
02:26:37.16 --> 02:26:42.28
the irony there is early on. It wasn't with joint warfare. It was with Criollo. I forgot my

1970
02:26:42.84 --> 02:26:48.12
in New York. Oh, yeah, New York. And Jenna comes in, you know, actually I told Lave, I told a bunch of

1971
02:26:48.12 --> 02:26:52.28
people, but you know, don't want to really want to give me any. Yeah, I didn't. I didn't want to give

1972
02:26:52.28 --> 02:26:57.88
you any. Yeah, because I travel with like the number of that I need for that time period that

1973
02:26:57.88 --> 02:27:03.48
I'm going for. I can't spare any. Can't really run it around with like extra acrylic oils. You

1974
02:27:05.32 --> 02:27:09.80
say you're not going to be my water in the field. I carried it. I'm drinking it unless you're going to die.

1975
02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:16.68
Yeah, I'll say really, yeah, exactly. Well, in high school, when I when me and J with when my brother

1976
02:27:16.68 --> 02:27:23.08
me and my brother would lift, so we were real like discipline with the post workout meal, right? And it

1977
02:27:23.08 --> 02:27:27.24
wouldn't, I wouldn't say it would be measured out, but there'd be enough. You know, you'd have to have

1978
02:27:27.24 --> 02:27:32.28
a specific amount for the post workout meal. So if we were to go buy sushi or go buy something like

1979
02:27:32.28 --> 02:27:37.72
good and maybe, you know, my brother or I would ask, oh, let me get something. Let me taste it. We'd

1980
02:27:37.72 --> 02:27:42.92
say I can't spare the nutrients. So I can't give you any. I want to share, but I can't

1981
02:27:42.92 --> 02:27:48.68
throw the nutrients from my workout, whatever. No, that's what you do. That's what you do with your

1982
02:27:48.68 --> 02:27:55.72
crew. Well, unless that after, you know, a few hours of failure of getting more krill oil,

1983
02:27:55.96 --> 02:28:02.12
Jenna Lee, Bavin came through with the krill oil. Nice. Yeah. So it's kind of new. We're back in the game.

1984
02:28:02.12 --> 02:28:08.36
Oh, huge time. So it's just ironic that life, Jenna's there, husband. Yeah, went through the same deal.

1985
02:28:08.36 --> 02:28:13.48
Yeah. Yeah. You got to be careful with that. You don't want to run. Don't fall off. Yeah. And you do

1986
02:28:13.48 --> 02:28:19.000
mention where your kid, Mark, if you got kids get them where your kid, Mark, don't even play around.

1987
02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:25.32
Don't even play around. What are you going to give him? Hershey's syrup to make chocolate milk.

1988
02:28:25.72 --> 02:28:31.96
You need to give him Nestle's quick to make chocolate milk. Why don't you just give them a big

1989
02:28:31.96 --> 02:28:39.32
glass of type 2 diabetes? Because that's what you're doing. Yeah. Or you can say, hey, here's something

1990
02:28:39.32 --> 02:28:46.44
that tastes better and is incredibly good for you. Yes. So there you go. Where your kid milk. You can

1991
02:28:46.44 --> 02:28:51.88
get some of that. Well, you look a little bit. Also, you want to represent while on the path.

1992
02:28:51.88 --> 02:28:58.44
Chocolate is still called jocco store. Obviously. Original. Yeah. We all know that. I think by now.

1993
02:28:58.44 --> 02:29:03.80
Actually, maybe not everybody unless jocco store.com. That's where you can get your

1994
02:29:04.20 --> 02:29:11.16
discipline equals freedom. T-shirts, rash guards. No one out by the way. We have a new rash guard

1995
02:29:11.16 --> 02:29:17.40
out. Stand by to get some. Stand by to get some jiu-jitsu. Or what is your doing? Wait,

1996
02:29:17.40 --> 02:29:20.44
stand by to get the new rash guard or that's what the rash guard says. But.

1997
02:29:20.44 --> 02:29:26.52
Good. All right. Cool. T-shirts, rash guards, hats, tracers, and things.

1998
02:29:26.52 --> 02:29:30.68
Thee these light weight hoodies for those of you that live in the lower 40s.

1999
02:29:30.68 --> 02:29:33.40
Yeah. Great. No, Brady Lanter texted me. He was like,

2000
02:29:33.40 --> 02:29:38.84
Brady today. He's in Michigan. He's in Michigan. He said today is light weight hoody day.

2001
02:29:39.48 --> 02:29:44.60
Yeah. Well, he also did a good job of posting that little thing of him out in the freezing cold.

2002
02:29:44.60 --> 02:29:48.12
And he was like, we just need to light weight up here. Because he's hard to go. Oh, you're

2003
02:29:48.12 --> 02:29:51.80
teasing. Oh, okay. He's hard to work. He's hard to work. Well, right. If you're not as hard

2004
02:29:51.80 --> 02:29:56.12
work as Brady in those circumstances, we have heavy weight hoodies too. So boom, light and heavy,

2005
02:29:56.12 --> 02:29:59.88
whatever you need, whatever you like. A lot of cool stuff on there. If you like something,

2006
02:30:00.44 --> 02:30:05.80
good. So don't forget about jocquay T, which I am currently drinking. And the reason I'm drinking

2007
02:30:05.80 --> 02:30:11.000
it is not only because it tastes good, but also because I like having an 8,000 pound deadlift

2008
02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:19.24
actually 100% guaranteed. If you drink a jocquay T and you can't deadlift 8,000 pounds,

2009
02:30:19.88 --> 02:30:26.28
you can send me the empty can and I'll send you the nickel for the can. Yeah. So that's

2010
02:30:26.28 --> 02:30:32.04
don't forget to subscribe to the podcast because if you don't then go ahead and you just don't

2011
02:30:32.04 --> 02:30:35.80
know what you're thinking. You know what? You don't subscribe. Yeah, if you don't subscribe, then you're

2012
02:30:35.80 --> 02:30:40.68
not subscribed, which isn't good. Kind of like a case when you launch occasionally,

2013
02:30:40.68 --> 02:30:45.32
but rare occasion, we launch something randomly for like some kind of an event, some kind of

2014
02:30:45.32 --> 02:30:49.24
a situation for launch the rent. So if you're just expecting, oh, it's Wednesday, I know when I'm

2015
02:30:49.24 --> 02:30:54.36
going to get the podcast that you jump on there. There's another one waiting for you. Yeah. So

2016
02:30:54.36 --> 02:30:59.08
if you want to get those, know those, subscribe to the podcast, whatever you subscribe to the podcast.

2017
02:30:59.08 --> 02:31:06.92
And don't forget about the Warrior Kid podcast, which is awesome. For some reason, I always clear

2018
02:31:06.92 --> 02:31:14.28
myself hot to say that Warrior Kid stuff is awesome. I think it's because I'm saying it as like a

2019
02:31:14.28 --> 02:31:19.72
dad. You know what I mean? Yes, I do know. I'm not saying it directed at myself. Yeah, look, I don't mean

2020
02:31:19.72 --> 02:31:27.48
like, hey, I'm great at the Warrior Kid podcast. I'm not saying that. I'm saying it as a dad. You can

2021
02:31:27.48 --> 02:31:33.64
get your kid to listen to Warrior Kid podcast. It will benefit them greatly in trying to figure out

2022
02:31:33.64 --> 02:31:41.08
the ways of the world and how to live in this crazy world that we have. And also, there's a Warrior

2023
02:31:41.08 --> 02:31:48.28
Kid that makes soap in Central California. Well, I guess it's Southern California, but anyways, Irish

2024
02:31:48.28 --> 02:31:54.60
Oaks Ranch.com, young Aiden, runner-to-business, at least 13 years old, pretty soon he's not going

2025
02:31:54.60 --> 02:32:02.52
to be a kid anymore. But in the meantime, you get some of the soap so you can stay clean. And we got

2026
02:32:02.52 --> 02:32:11.64
a YouTube video channel. Was that what it's called? Yeah, yes, you video channel. Yeah, right as opposed

2027
02:32:11.64 --> 02:32:19.96
to YouTube what channel? Audio channel. Well, anyways, on that video channel on YouTube, which the

2028
02:32:19.96 --> 02:32:26.68
video channel is called, Jocco podcast. That's the video channel, right? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. So if you go to

2029
02:32:26.68 --> 02:32:32.28
that, you can watch a bunch of videos that Echo Charles made. And you can watch this podcast. You can

2030
02:32:32.28 --> 02:32:39.48
see what Echo Charles looks like. He looks like not like what he sounds evidently. And also, he

2031
02:32:39.48 --> 02:32:49.64
makes, he's, what do you, what do you experiment with? Sure. Yeah, he makes videos with his own personal skills.

2032
02:32:52.36 --> 02:32:58.36
Right? Yeah, such an eloquent interest thing. Well, the thing is I feel like a lot of times when you

2033
02:32:58.36 --> 02:33:04.28
make videos, you're not, you're experimenting. You know what? You're not that is, it's not like,

2034
02:33:04.28 --> 02:33:09.64
it's not like I'm saying, hey, make this video and here's the effect that we want. Right, right, right.

2035
02:33:09.64 --> 02:33:16.44
You're just over there just making videos. And they just, with your own vision. Yeah. Well,

2036
02:33:16.44 --> 02:33:22.04
the goal, okay, so the goal, well, the goal for the whole YouTube thing is sure the video version,

2037
02:33:22.04 --> 02:33:26.76
you know, watch the podcast, which you know, man, that's I dig it now. A lot of people do that. I dig it.

2038
02:33:28.04 --> 02:33:32.60
And then the excerpts we have excerpts on there too. If you don't watch the whole thing, you know,

2039
02:33:32.60 --> 02:33:38.68
you can watch, you can share those. Yeah. Cool. But yeah, and then sure, I'll take an excerpts

2040
02:33:38.68 --> 02:33:43.64
essentially, taking excerpts and kind of video wise has some fun with it. You know, add some

2041
02:33:44.44 --> 02:33:51.08
facts and music and stuff. And yes, very much experimental. What we should make a video of what my life

2042
02:33:51.08 --> 02:33:58.20
would be like if everything was reflective of how your videos are. I thought about that. Yeah,

2043
02:33:58.20 --> 02:34:02.76
that was going to funny. Because like actually that warpath video, that's essentially kind of

2044
02:34:02.76 --> 02:34:06.04
trying to do the thing is like if you're on the warpath and here's all the things that you're doing.

2045
02:34:06.04 --> 02:34:11.96
So it showed like, you know, the little video clips of me when I or not of me that I got of you

2046
02:34:11.96 --> 02:34:17.56
just doing your stuff. You do. And writing and stuff. So you put it on the warpath. That's kind of what

2047
02:34:17.56 --> 02:34:25.08
it represents a little bit. It's just a path of destruction in a constructive way. Check. So you can

2048
02:34:25.08 --> 02:34:31.48
do that. You can also get psychological warfare, which is a little bunch of tracks to help you over

2049
02:34:31.48 --> 02:34:36.44
come moments of weakness, which apparently are quite effective because I've had many people

2050
02:34:36.44 --> 02:34:43.96
explained to me that they utilize them regularly. Yeah. So psychological warfare, iTunes, Google Play,

2051
02:34:43.96 --> 02:34:50.52
MP3, platforms of all kinds. You can you can check that out. Also check out Flipside

2052
02:34:50.52 --> 02:34:57.48
Canvas, which is Dakota Meyer. If you have a listen of episode 115 of this podcast, it's one of

2053
02:34:57.48 --> 02:35:05.000
the most popular podcasts, one of the heaviest podcasts, one of the most impactful podcasts.

2054
02:35:06.52 --> 02:35:12.28
And there's a lot of impactful podcasts. So I guess that's saying a lot. But Dakota's making,

2057
02:35:25.72 --> 02:35:31.40
based on this podcast. He's got one that says discipline equals freedom. He's got one that says good.

2058
02:35:32.20 --> 02:35:37.32
He's got one that says time is running out. And he's got one that says, yeah, to have grit.

So if you want to get one of those, if you want to post that thing up, then you can post it up.

You can just have a giant get after it on your ceiling where you sleep. So when you wake up in the

02:39:56.44 --> 02:40:02.12
got me through today. Yeah. So there you go. Just when you go freedom field manual get that one.

2103
02:40:02.12 --> 02:40:09.56
It's not on audible. It's on iTunes Amazon music Google play on it's on MP3 platforms. Don't

2104
02:40:09.56 --> 02:40:14.52
forget about extreme ownership. The first book I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin, about what we

2105
02:40:14.52 --> 02:40:18.92
learned in combat and how you can apply it to your business and your world and your life. And

2106
02:40:18.92 --> 02:40:24.44
then we followed that up with the dichotomy of leadership at which we are now getting multiple reports

2107
02:40:24.44 --> 02:40:29.16
from the battlefield that the dichotomy of leadership is a little bit better. Some people think.

2108
02:40:30.44 --> 02:40:36.92
I am. I kind of felt that way. But you know extreme ownership has the core.

2109
02:40:38.04 --> 02:40:42.44
Like it's always going to have. It's always going to be the bigger brother. Yeah. That's the O.G.

2110
02:40:42.44 --> 02:40:48.20
But you never know, man. dichotomy sometimes that that other kid, right? Yeah. Sometimes the other kid

2111
02:40:48.20 --> 02:40:52.28
has the has a little bit. You can learn lessons. That's exactly what happened with dichotomy.

2112
02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.88
We learned lessons after we wrote extreme ownership and said, you know, what the most,

2113
02:40:55.88 --> 02:41:00.52
you know, with the hardest thing for people to do is balance the dichotomy of leadership. That was

2114
02:41:00.52 --> 02:41:05.80
chapter 12. In extreme ownership, then it became a whole book. Yeah. So it was kind of like

2115
02:41:05.80 --> 02:41:10.28
rambo, right? You know, so rambo when people say, who do you think you're rambo?

2116
02:41:11.56 --> 02:41:17.40
They're talking about rambo first blood part two. Right. So dichotomy is kind of like rambo where

2117
02:41:17.40 --> 02:41:22.84
like people are like, oh, I love the dichotomy love, but but the people who know know that first blood

2118
02:41:22.84 --> 02:41:29.64
is the real movie is the real O.G. One that rambo's not better. Rambo's not rambo gets a lot of glory.

2119
02:41:29.64 --> 02:41:34.52
They get the praise and it's awesome. Well, one thing that I guarantee you is that dichotomy leadership

2120
02:41:34.52 --> 02:41:41.08
is not jaws to which no one talks about jaws to no one cares about jaws. Oh,

2121
02:41:41.08 --> 02:41:50.04
just as one is epic. Yeah. So the dichotomy leadership is epic and it's own right. It's like

2122
02:41:50.04 --> 02:41:53.96
any can stand on its own. But it's still going to be still on the shadow. It seems to be coming

2123
02:41:53.96 --> 02:41:57.96
out from the shadow. I guess that's what I'm saying. Just like rambo. Okay. Well, that's good.

2124
02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:05.08
Don't forget about echelon front. That is our leadership consultancy is we solve problems

02:42:44.12 --> 02:42:48.92
in Denver, and it's Sydney this year. Go to extremownership.com. Every one of these events that we've

2132
02:42:48.92 --> 02:42:53.72
done have sold out. So these are all going to sell out. They're on track to sell out right now.

2133
02:42:53.72 --> 02:43:00.28
So if you want to come to those go to echelonfront.com and or extremownership.com, and you can

register now before it sells out. And when it sells out, you're in me mad. Don't be mad at me.

2135
02:43:05.56 --> 02:43:10.76
Take ownership of it. I'm trying to take ownership right now. Telling you that it's going to sell out.

2136
02:43:10.76 --> 02:43:14.60
I'm taking ownership of the fact that it's going to sell out. And I'm trying to communicate it to you.

2137
02:43:14.92 --> 02:43:20.36
Hopefully listen. So that's that. Yeah, fall in line. If you can't make it to the master. Or let's say you

2138
02:43:20.36 --> 02:43:26.12
got 300 people in your company or 3000 people in your company. And you want to bring them all the

2139
02:43:26.12 --> 02:43:32.36
master. And you can't. Or you want to bring echelonfront in. But echelonfront. We can't travel to the

2140
02:43:32.36 --> 02:43:39.000
nine countries that your company is located at. So guess what? That's why we made EF online so that you

2141
02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:50.44
can do and your entire organization can get completely aligned in how you are utilizing leadership

2142
02:43:50.44 --> 02:43:56.36
across your organization. So it's online, but it's not just watching videos. It's yes, there's

2143
02:43:56.36 --> 02:44:02.12
videos, but it's also interactive where you get put in the leadership scenarios. And then you have to

2144
02:44:02.12 --> 02:44:07.32
figure out what to do. And if you choose the wrong scenario, you're going to lead your company or your

2145
02:44:07.32 --> 02:44:15.56
platoon into a bad situation. So check it out. EF online.com. And I already talked about this.

2146
02:44:15.56 --> 02:44:22.92
HeF overwatch. This is the company that we have now where we're taking special operations and combat

2147
02:44:22.92 --> 02:44:31.32
aviation people, leaders and putting them into companies. So that the companies can utilize the

2148
02:44:31.32 --> 02:44:39.16
leadership skills of these experienced combat leaders to help their company lead to victory.

2149
02:44:40.52 --> 02:44:46.28
And as I mentioned earlier, you don't. I recommend you don't hire just based on experience.

2150
02:44:46.28 --> 02:44:54.28
Recommend you hire people based on the talent that they have. Especially the leadership capable

2151
02:44:54.28 --> 02:45:04.52
to the staff. And if you want to stay in the game with us, Echo and I are actually on the

2155
02:45:25.48 --> 02:45:31.16
dispatchers. I spent some time as I said with the police out in North Carolina recently. And

2156
02:45:32.28 --> 02:45:39.48
what a tough job. And what a great bunch of people out there putting it all in the line to protect

2157
02:45:39.48 --> 02:45:49.72
us here at home. And of course, to our military men and women, like the one that I open up this

2158
02:45:49.72 --> 02:45:58.52
podcast with Fred Garland, Bragg, Jr. First Lieutenant, US Army, killed an action Vietnam on July

2159
02:45:58.52 --> 02:46:13.24
12th, 1967. But a hero, a leader and an example to all of us that regardless of the odds you are facing,

2160
02:46:15.56 --> 02:46:23.32
you can stand up and you can fight. And to everyone else out there, you can do the same thing.

2161
02:46:23.32 --> 02:46:29.96
Every day stand up to whatever challenges you face and get after it.

2162
02:46:32.28 --> 02:46:36.20
