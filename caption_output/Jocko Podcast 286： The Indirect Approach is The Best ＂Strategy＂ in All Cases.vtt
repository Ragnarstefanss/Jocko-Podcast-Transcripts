00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.40
This is Jockel podcast number 286 with echo turtles and me.

2
00:00:05.40 --> 00:00:06.70
Jockel will like good evening.

3
00:00:06.70 --> 00:00:09.80
I go good evening and also joining us again.

4
00:00:09.80 --> 00:00:10.90
Dave Burke.

5
00:00:10.90 --> 00:00:12.40
Good evening Dave.

6
00:00:12.40 --> 00:00:13.40
Good evening.

7
00:00:13.40 --> 00:00:20.90
So if you haven't listened to 285, just go back and listen to 285 right now.

8
00:00:20.90 --> 00:00:25.60
We are exploring some of the works of BH LaDelle Hart.

9
00:00:25.60 --> 00:00:29.40
I explain who he is on 285.

10
00:00:29.40 --> 00:00:36.60
He's a British soldier, World War I, military theorist, military historian, wrote influenced.

11
00:00:36.60 --> 00:00:37.60
He's an influencer.

12
00:00:37.60 --> 00:00:40.60
He's kind of an OG influencer.

13
00:00:40.60 --> 00:00:42.60
And he legit was.

14
00:00:42.60 --> 00:00:46.60
He had a lot of influence inside the British military.

15
00:00:46.60 --> 00:00:53.20
He had influence in all kinds of different military organizations, including some enemy

16
00:00:53.20 --> 00:00:55.50
military organizations that actually listened to what he had to say.

17
00:00:55.50 --> 00:01:00.70
So if you haven't listened to 285 yet, go back, listen to 285 and we're going to jump right

18
00:01:00.70 --> 00:01:04.10
back in to his book, which is called strategy.

19
00:01:04.10 --> 00:01:08.50
It's a, the last one we covered was the strategy of the indirect approach.

20
00:01:08.50 --> 00:01:13.30
This, look, everything he does is tied into the strategy of indirect approach.

21
00:01:13.30 --> 00:01:17.50
And we're going to jump back into this, his other book, well, he's got many books.

22
00:01:17.50 --> 00:01:20.50
One of his other books called Simply Strategy.

23
00:01:20.50 --> 00:01:25.50
Basically, they'll, here we go, they have anything before I just jump right into this thing.

24
00:01:25.50 --> 00:01:26.50
No, let's do it.

25
00:01:26.50 --> 00:01:32.50
Okay, so we're going to get into a section here called basis of strategy.

26
00:01:32.50 --> 00:01:35.50
And I think it's very interesting how this one kicks off.

27
00:01:35.50 --> 00:01:41.50
A deeper truth to which fuck and other disciples of classwrites did not penetrate fully

28
00:01:41.50 --> 00:01:48.50
is that in war, every problem and every principle is a duality.

29
00:01:48.50 --> 00:01:51.50
Like a coin, it has two faces.

30
00:01:51.50 --> 00:01:55.50
So this may remind you of another book you might have heard of called the dichotomy

31
00:01:55.50 --> 00:01:56.50
a leadership.

32
00:01:56.50 --> 00:01:57.50
There you go.

33
00:01:57.50 --> 00:02:00.50
Again, I think I owe this guy some royalties.

34
00:02:00.50 --> 00:02:01.50
I didn't know.

35
00:02:01.50 --> 00:02:06.50
I mean, I could have called the book the duality of leadership, but I didn't.

36
00:02:06.50 --> 00:02:09.50
Right, called the dichotomy a leadership.

37
00:02:09.50 --> 00:02:10.50
Like a coin, it has two faces.

38
00:02:10.50 --> 00:02:15.50
Hence the need for well, a well calculated compromise as a new one.

39
00:02:15.50 --> 00:02:20.50
Well, calculated compromise as a means to reconciliation.

40
00:02:20.50 --> 00:02:22.50
What does that mean be balanced?

41
00:02:22.50 --> 00:02:24.50
Big shocker.

42
00:02:24.50 --> 00:02:28.50
This is the inevitable consequence of the fact that war is a two-party affair.

43
00:02:28.50 --> 00:02:34.50
So imposing the need that while hitting one must guard.

44
00:02:34.50 --> 00:02:37.50
This is just the, you got a balance that I caught in me some leadership.

45
00:02:37.50 --> 00:02:38.50
You can't just be on all.

46
00:02:38.50 --> 00:02:40.50
It's all offence, you got to have a guard up.

47
00:02:40.50 --> 00:02:43.50
You can't just be have your guard up, you got to go on offence, you got to be balanced.

48
00:02:43.50 --> 00:02:47.50
It's a corollary that in order to hit with effect the enemy must be taken off.

49
00:02:47.50 --> 00:02:53.50
His guard, effective concentration can only be obtained when the opposing forces are dispersed

50
00:02:53.50 --> 00:03:00.50
and usually in order to ensure this, once own forces must be widely distributed.

51
00:03:00.50 --> 00:03:07.50
Thus, by an outward paradox, true concentration is the product of dispersion.

52
00:03:07.50 --> 00:03:09.50
So isn't this interesting?

53
00:03:09.50 --> 00:03:17.50
We have to concentrate our forces, but we have to disperse our forces in order to dislocate and put the enemy off balance.

54
00:03:17.50 --> 00:03:19.50
So there's an economy.

55
00:03:19.50 --> 00:03:24.50
We have to be together so that we can act effectively, but we have to be spread out.

56
00:03:24.50 --> 00:03:26.50
So we can put the enemy off balance.

57
00:03:26.50 --> 00:03:28.50
What happens if we get too far spread out?

58
00:03:28.50 --> 00:03:30.50
Well, now we're, now we're weak.

59
00:03:30.50 --> 00:03:31.50
What happens if we're too concentrated?

60
00:03:31.50 --> 00:03:36.50
Well, now we can't disperse the, we can't dislocate the enemy.

61
00:03:36.50 --> 00:03:41.50
A further consequence of the two-party condition is that to ensure reaching an objective,

62
00:03:41.50 --> 00:03:48.50
one should have an alternative objective or alternative objectives.

63
00:03:48.50 --> 00:03:49.50
Plural.

64
00:03:49.50 --> 00:03:58.50
Here in lies, a vital contrast to the single-minded 19th-century doctrine of fuck and his fellows,

65
00:03:58.50 --> 00:04:02.50
a contrast of the practical to the theoretical.

66
00:04:02.50 --> 00:04:09.50
For if the enemy is certain as to your point of aim, he has the best possible chance of guarding himself,

67
00:04:09.50 --> 00:04:11.50
and blunting your weapon.

68
00:04:11.50 --> 00:04:13.50
This is why in Gigietsu, you have to do more than one move.

69
00:04:13.50 --> 00:04:18.50
You can't just grab the arm and think you're going to get the arm lock, it's not going to work.

70
00:04:18.50 --> 00:04:26.50
If, on the other hand, you take a line that threatens alternative objectives, you distract his mind and his forces.

71
00:04:26.50 --> 00:04:37.50
This, moreover, is the most economic method of distraction for it allows you to keep the largest proportion of your force available on your real line of operation,

72
00:04:37.50 --> 00:04:45.50
thus reconciling the greatest possible concentration with the necessity of dispersion.

73
00:04:45.50 --> 00:04:49.50
So, you have to have some different objectives.

74
00:04:49.50 --> 00:04:55.50
If you just grab the arm, that's not going to, if you just flank, if you're like, okay, hey, we're going to flank the enemy.

75
00:04:55.50 --> 00:04:57.50
Okay, the enemy goes, oh wait, looks like they're moving over there.

76
00:04:57.50 --> 00:05:01.50
Cool. Now we adjust our forces, now that flank becomes the front.

77
00:05:01.50 --> 00:05:04.50
So you have to have multiple objectives. Now, what if you go to flank and they think,

78
00:05:04.50 --> 00:05:07.50
oh, that's not, that's just a, that's just a fake move.

79
00:05:07.50 --> 00:05:09.50
So now they don't put their forces over, then you attack it.

80
00:05:09.50 --> 00:05:16.50
But if you only have one objective, and the enemy recognizes what that is, they're going to defend it heavily,

81
00:05:16.50 --> 00:05:22.50
and you're not going to be able to achieve victory.

82
00:05:22.50 --> 00:05:28.50
So the absence of an alternative is contrary to the very nature of war.

83
00:05:28.50 --> 00:05:37.50
It sins against the light, which Borzet shed in the 18th century by his most penetrating victim,

84
00:05:37.50 --> 00:05:43.50
that, quote, every plan of campaign ought to have several branches,

85
00:05:43.50 --> 00:05:54.50
and to have been so well fought out that one or the other of the said branches cannot fail of success.

86
00:05:54.50 --> 00:06:03.50
So get gotta have multiple branches, and they should be well enough fought out that one of them is going to work.

87
00:06:03.50 --> 00:06:09.50
One of, one of those branches, one of those lines of operation is going to work.

88
00:06:09.50 --> 00:06:20.50
This was the light that his military air, the young Napoleon Bonaparte, followed in seeking always, as he said, you guys want me to go French?

89
00:06:20.50 --> 00:06:22.50
Yeah, kind of.

90
00:06:22.50 --> 00:06:29.50
A fair, son, fame, and dur, facions.

91
00:06:29.50 --> 00:06:32.50
There you go. What does that mean?

92
00:06:32.50 --> 00:06:36.50
It means, make your theme in two ways.

93
00:06:36.50 --> 00:06:40.50
You've got to have two different approaches.

94
00:06:40.50 --> 00:06:45.50
And it's just, he calls it, it's a sin against the old victims, right?

95
00:06:45.50 --> 00:06:48.50
Which is a gun, you gotta have a focus, you gotta aim for that.

96
00:06:48.50 --> 00:06:50.50
Contintrate your forces in one spot.

97
00:06:50.50 --> 00:06:53.50
It's like, cool, what if the enemy defends that one spot?

98
00:06:53.50 --> 00:06:59.50
You're screwed in technical terms.

99
00:06:59.50 --> 00:07:11.50
Seven years later, Sherman was to relearn the lesson from experience by reflection and coin, his infamous maximum about, quote, putting the enemy on the horns of a dilemma.

100
00:07:11.50 --> 00:07:12.50
End quote.

101
00:07:12.50 --> 00:07:19.50
In any problem, we're an opposing force exists, and cannot be regulated, one must foresee and provide for alternative courses.

102
00:07:19.50 --> 00:07:24.50
Adaptability is the law which governs survival and war as in life.

103
00:07:24.50 --> 00:07:30.50
War being a concentrated, war being but a concentrated form of the human struggle against the environment.

104
00:07:30.50 --> 00:07:32.50
Thank you.

105
00:07:32.50 --> 00:07:41.50
Amplified, intensified, but nonetheless, a concentrated form of the human struggle.

106
00:07:41.50 --> 00:07:47.50
To be practical, any plan must take account of the enemy's power to frustrate it.

107
00:07:47.50 --> 00:07:57.50
The best chance of overcoming such an obstruction is to have a plan that can be easily very to fit the circumstances met.

108
00:07:57.50 --> 00:08:00.50
I mean, I just was saying this today on a YF online.

109
00:08:00.50 --> 00:08:02.50
You gotta have a flexible plan.

110
00:08:02.50 --> 00:08:04.50
You gotta have a flexible plan.

111
00:08:04.50 --> 00:08:07.50
And you think that seems super obvious, but you know what?

112
00:08:07.50 --> 00:08:11.50
People want to control, and they want to eliminate the unknown.

113
00:08:11.50 --> 00:08:14.50
And how do you eliminate the unknown? You come up with a plan.

114
00:08:14.50 --> 00:08:19.50
Well, guess what? They're still unknown even when you have a plan.

115
00:08:19.50 --> 00:08:29.50
And the more rigid you make a plan, the less adaptable and flexible it becomes, which is bad.

116
00:08:29.50 --> 00:08:38.50
To keep such adaptability while keeping the initiative, the best way is to operate a long align, which offers alternative objectives.

117
00:08:38.50 --> 00:08:43.50
For thereby, you put your opponent on the horns of a dilemma, which goes far to assure the game.

118
00:08:43.50 --> 00:08:50.50
To assure the gaining of at least one objective, whichever is the least guarded, and may enable you to gain the other one afterwards.

119
00:08:50.50 --> 00:08:52.50
Boom.

120
00:08:52.50 --> 00:09:07.50
In the tactical field where the enemy's dispositions are likely to be based on the nature of the ground, it may be more difficult to find a choice of dilemma producing objectives than it is in the strategic field where the enemy will have obvious industrial and railway centers to cover.

121
00:09:07.50 --> 00:09:15.50
But you can gain a similar advantage by adapting your line of effort to the degree of resistance that is met and exploiting any weaknesses is found.

122
00:09:15.50 --> 00:09:25.50
A plan like a tree must have branches if it is to bear fruit. A plan with a single aim is apt to prove a barren pole.

123
00:09:25.50 --> 00:09:40.50
I'm just thinking of this idea of having multiple objectives, and then the dilemma that that causes, and even just in aviation terms like we go out on a mission and our objective is to destroy enemy or defenses.

124
00:09:40.50 --> 00:09:44.50
Sam sides or mobile sams or whatever it might be.

125
00:09:44.50 --> 00:09:52.50
But it's actually reliant on them to have those systems active and operating because how you find them, if they're shut down in the dormit, you actually can't find them.

126
00:09:52.50 --> 00:09:56.50
If they're mediating, they're not uncovered, you could fly around and not have them there.

127
00:09:56.50 --> 00:10:03.50
But if they don't have their Sam systems or air defense is objective, then the things that they're defending are vulnerable.

128
00:10:03.50 --> 00:10:07.50
So the secondary mission we'd have these, the thing called a TPL, a target priority list of these things aren't there?

129
00:10:07.50 --> 00:10:12.50
Cool, go to this. Those things aren't there? Cool, go to this. And sooner or later one will be exposed.

130
00:10:12.50 --> 00:10:19.50
And as you start to attack those defended positions, like bridges or roads or things that matter.

131
00:10:19.50 --> 00:10:31.50
And on those right now, there's turn on the radar. It's exactly right. And that idea that we would have multiple target priorities, which all eventually are designed to lead us back to the number one priority, which might not get on that mission.

132
00:10:31.50 --> 00:10:33.50
But we get in the next wave or the next wave.

133
00:10:33.50 --> 00:10:46.50
And sooner or later they're stuck in a place like, well, if we don't turn these things on, we're going to lose all of our critical infrastructure and there's nothing to defend and creating that dilemma by having multiple objectives on each flight.

134
00:10:46.50 --> 00:11:00.50
And in the business world, this whole concept is we hear debates or arguments against this, right? You got to have a clear objective.

135
00:11:00.50 --> 00:11:06.50
And that makes sense. I tell people that we got to make sure we understand what the objective is.

136
00:11:06.50 --> 00:11:10.50
That being said, we also don't want to have a single point of failure.

137
00:11:10.50 --> 00:11:22.50
Where hey, you know what, we're going to make one product. We're going to make one product. And if this product does, it's products is the one. We're going to put all of our money, all of our birds in this basket.

138
00:11:22.50 --> 00:11:23.50
Is that the one?

139
00:11:23.50 --> 00:11:24.50
Eggs.

140
00:11:24.50 --> 00:11:29.50
All our eggs that are going to go in this basket. Don't do that. Don't do that.

141
00:11:29.50 --> 00:11:33.50
Don't put all your eggs in one basket. That's there you go. Never mind.

142
00:11:33.50 --> 00:11:40.50
Be aged l'a d'elle hart, whichever farmer thought of that one after his kid dropped the basket full of eggs. Right?

143
00:11:40.50 --> 00:11:47.50
Is like hey kid, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Put them in two baskets. Same thing.

144
00:11:47.50 --> 00:11:49.50
It's the exact same thing.

145
00:11:49.50 --> 00:11:53.50
And yet, we can get focused on one objective.

146
00:11:53.50 --> 00:12:00.50
And as soon as you meet resistance, if you're not ready to switch to another one, like Dave Burke, flying up there and going,

147
00:12:00.50 --> 00:12:03.94
going home, there's nothing to let you shoot at. Cool. What's the next objective? Bridges.

148
00:12:03.94 --> 00:12:11.22
Let's go. Rock and roll. Okay. So now we're going to roll a new section called cutting

149
00:12:11.22 --> 00:12:17.14
communications in planning any stroke at the enemy's communications either by maneuver

150
00:12:17.14 --> 00:12:22.10
round his flank or by rapid penetration of a breach and his front. The question will

151
00:12:22.10 --> 00:12:26.10
arise as to the most effective point of aim whether it should be directly against the

152
00:12:26.10 --> 00:12:32.98
immediate rear or the opposing force or further back. When studying the question, so again,

153
00:12:32.98 --> 00:12:39.94
and I talked about this before on the last podcast is, every time it talks about communications,

154
00:12:39.94 --> 00:12:46.74
it's telling you, hey, you better, you better keep your communication open. We talk about attacking

155
00:12:46.74 --> 00:12:50.26
the enemy's communications and that's how we cause unbalanced and that's how we kind of crush

156
00:12:50.26 --> 00:12:55.38
them. Great. We're glad to know that. That's also a reminder to us as leaders that

157
00:12:55.38 --> 00:13:01.78
communication is so paramount to getting our job done. When he's got a whole section called

158
00:13:01.78 --> 00:13:06.58
cutting communication, guess what? That should mean to us from a red cell perspective. Don't let

159
00:13:06.58 --> 00:13:10.58
your communication get cut. And yet we work with companies all the time where the communication

160
00:13:10.58 --> 00:13:14.26
isn't open and it's not flowing and people on the front line don't know what's happening.

161
00:13:14.26 --> 00:13:18.10
And the people in the head shed don't get the feedback that they should be getting from the front

162
00:13:18.10 --> 00:13:22.58
lines. There's not communication happening. And yet there's a whole section here about cutting

163
00:13:22.58 --> 00:13:26.98
communication and you're allowing your communications to be cut when there's not even an enemy.

164
00:13:26.98 --> 00:13:31.86
It's not like your competitor got into your email system or got into your phone system and didn't

165
00:13:31.86 --> 00:13:35.86
let you call your front line leadership. That didn't happen. You failed to do it.

166
00:13:39.22 --> 00:13:44.74
So where do we cut the communication? When studying this question at the time that experimental

167
00:13:44.74 --> 00:13:48.58
mechanized forces were first created and their strategic use was under consideration. I saw

168
00:13:48.58 --> 00:13:54.42
guidance on it by analysis of cavalry raids carried out in the past especially in the more recent

169
00:13:54.42 --> 00:13:59.30
wars since railways came into use. While such cavalry raids had more limited potentials

170
00:13:59.30 --> 00:14:04.10
than a deep strategic penetration of mechanized forces seemed to me to promise

171
00:14:05.14 --> 00:14:10.10
that this difference emphasized rather than detracted from making the significant evidence

172
00:14:10.10 --> 00:14:14.82
which they provided, making the necessary adjustment the following deductions could be drawn.

173
00:14:14.82 --> 00:14:20.90
And I'm going to kind of burn through this section. The overall concept is that

174
00:14:21.54 --> 00:14:25.30
the nearer to the force that the cut is made the more immediate the effect.

175
00:14:26.74 --> 00:14:30.74
And the nearer to the base the greater the effect. This is common sense. Right? If you kill the

176
00:14:31.14 --> 00:14:36.82
the node at the headquarters, they can't communicate to anybody, but it's going to take a while

177
00:14:36.82 --> 00:14:40.34
for that impact to hit the front lines for them to actually not know what's going on.

178
00:14:40.34 --> 00:14:47.62
Whereas if you cut the front line node, that immediate node is kind of messed up. So that's the general

179
00:14:47.62 --> 00:14:56.58
consensus that he gets into there. He goes on to say these deductions were confirmed by the

180
00:14:56.58 --> 00:15:02.58
experience of the second war above all the catastrophic, the catastrophically paralyzing effect

181
00:15:02.58 --> 00:15:10.90
physically and psychologically that was produced when gradients, panzerforces, racing far ahead of the

182
00:15:10.90 --> 00:15:17.22
main German armies severed the Allied army's communications where these crossed the far back line

183
00:15:17.22 --> 00:15:23.62
of the song and this is where you run into problems. So catastrophically paralyzing when we start to

184
00:15:23.62 --> 00:15:29.14
cut off communications. So look, are you going to go into your competitors, you know, headquarters

185
00:15:29.14 --> 00:15:35.62
and destroy their their their internet and their email? No, you're not going to do that. But are you

186
00:15:35.62 --> 00:15:42.42
allowing that to happen just by just by human nature and laziness and not lack of prioritizing

187
00:15:42.42 --> 00:15:45.86
execute? Are you going to allow your communications to fall apart? There's a decent chance you are

188
00:15:45.86 --> 00:15:50.66
we work with companies all the time that aren't communicating. They might as well have had

189
00:15:51.62 --> 00:15:56.82
panzerforces going caught off their email between their front lines and them because there's no email

190
00:15:56.82 --> 00:16:00.58
happening. There's no conference calls happening. There's no text happening. We don't know what's

191
00:16:00.58 --> 00:16:06.58
going on. We've lost communications, not through enemy action, but through our own fault.

192
00:16:07.86 --> 00:16:13.62
Yeah, and one of the ways, one of the places we see that with business is that the communication

193
00:16:13.62 --> 00:16:20.98
is a one-way communication where I am dictating or or directing or communicating to you. I'm transmitting

194
00:16:20.98 --> 00:16:29.38
and there's no response to that transmission. There's no communication really isn't designed for me

195
00:16:29.38 --> 00:16:33.30
to hear what you have to say. It's for me to tell you what to do and how to do it and when to do it

196
00:16:33.30 --> 00:16:38.98
and where to do these things. Yeah, and I get that compliance, but I don't get that communication,

197
00:16:38.98 --> 00:16:46.18
which is a almost guaranteed that sooner or later when when they're as friction with that

198
00:16:46.18 --> 00:16:52.74
without that communication, is that plan is going to fail? Even when I was just talking about

199
00:16:52.74 --> 00:16:57.22
communication, I said, you're not getting the information in front lines and you're not getting

200
00:16:57.22 --> 00:17:02.10
the feedback you need, which is what you just said. It's like, hey, communication is supposed to go

201
00:17:02.10 --> 00:17:06.42
in two ways. That's what's supposed to be happening if we don't let it happen. We're going to have problems.

202
00:17:06.42 --> 00:17:14.50
We're going to have problems. And in making this relevant to these civilian world or the

203
00:17:14.50 --> 00:17:20.66
private sector, the needle, the bias needle of the communication, would be to be transmit is

204
00:17:20.66 --> 00:17:29.70
little as possible and receive as much as possible. When I have my team communicating to me,

205
00:17:29.70 --> 00:17:33.14
more than I'm communicating to them, here's what we're seeing, here's what we're doing, here's the

206
00:17:33.14 --> 00:17:36.02
problem, here's how we're doing, here's how we're doing, and so that's what you would want. That's how

207
00:17:36.02 --> 00:17:41.54
you would set up the bias. Yes, the bias is, if I see that I'm the, as the leader doing 90% of the

208
00:17:41.54 --> 00:17:47.30
communication, I'm, I'm, the needle is in the wrong direction. And so the ability for my people to

209
00:17:47.30 --> 00:17:52.50
communicate to me, for me to hear from them what they're doing, what they're seeing, where they are,

210
00:17:53.62 --> 00:18:00.10
and I'm doing less communicating to them than they are communicating up to me. That's where I want that needle.

211
00:18:01.38 --> 00:18:06.26
That falls into something I was talking about the other day on, on our online platform.

212
00:18:06.26 --> 00:18:12.18
I use this term in both, it's struck, I think both you and life, because you've never heard me say it

213
00:18:12.18 --> 00:18:17.70
before I started using the term traditional leadership. Yeah, and then like an archetypical leadership.

214
00:18:18.42 --> 00:18:22.82
What does that mean? Well, when we think of a leader, what do we think of? Like if you just say,

215
00:18:22.82 --> 00:18:26.50
oh, what does a leader do? Well, a leader gives orders, a leader talks, a leader tells everyone

216
00:18:26.50 --> 00:18:29.30
what's going on. They tell people what to do. That's traditional leadership.

217
00:18:29.30 --> 00:18:37.14
And actually in my mind, if I'm doing that sort of traditional leadership, I've made

218
00:18:37.14 --> 00:18:43.14
47 mistakes to get to a point where I have to tell you what's going on. I have to give orders. I have to

219
00:18:44.50 --> 00:18:48.82
give you direction about where to go and what to do. I've made so many mistakes if I'm doing

220
00:18:48.82 --> 00:18:54.10
that traditional leadership role of like, all right, here's what we're doing. Does that happen

221
00:18:54.10 --> 00:18:58.18
sometimes? And that was when I was talking about the case does sometimes happen where we got a

222
00:18:58.18 --> 00:19:02.74
leadership vacuum known as what to do. There's some confusion. And sometimes we do have to take

223
00:19:02.74 --> 00:19:05.94
a role as traditional leader, step in, tell everyone what to do, is what we're doing in this

224
00:19:05.94 --> 00:19:12.26
direction we're having. And in a traditional leadership role, I'm in charge. I'm the one that's

225
00:19:12.26 --> 00:19:19.86
putting out the word. We want to flip the script on that to what to your point. Traditional leadership

226
00:19:19.86 --> 00:19:28.82
is not what my ideal is. Ideal leadership is Dave's actually giving me information and telling

227
00:19:28.82 --> 00:19:33.70
me what's going on. And I have to give very little communication back because he already understands

228
00:19:33.70 --> 00:19:36.90
the community's intent and what his roles were ready. By the way, it knows more about what's

229
00:19:36.90 --> 00:19:41.14
happening on his front than I do totally. And he's trying to inform me, but still he's there.

230
00:19:41.14 --> 00:19:51.22
So that traditional leadership versus ideal leadership is something to pay attention to.

231
00:19:52.50 --> 00:19:59.38
And if you had whatever version of a catastrophic communication failure exists, it doesn't have to

232
00:19:59.38 --> 00:20:05.78
be the phone lines in combat, but something that prevents you from communicating. If your people can't

233
00:20:05.78 --> 00:20:10.02
operate based on your intent with zero communication and just go out there and execute and tell

234
00:20:10.02 --> 00:20:17.38
somehow that communication line is reopened for whatever reason. Again, that is your failure as a leader

235
00:20:17.38 --> 00:20:23.86
that they don't know what to do if you're not there to tell them what to do. So I don't, you know,

236
00:20:23.86 --> 00:20:29.06
in whatever world you're in your version of a communication cutoff, your people should still be

237
00:20:29.06 --> 00:20:37.30
able to execute. Honour of a zone. Next little section called the method of advanced until the

238
00:20:37.30 --> 00:20:42.58
end of the 18th century, a physically concentrated advance, both strategic to the battlefield

239
00:20:42.58 --> 00:20:52.26
and tactical on the battlefield was the rule. Then Napoleon, exporting, boursays, ideas, and new

240
00:20:52.26 --> 00:21:00.02
divisional system introduced a distributed strategic advance. The army moving in independent fractions.

241
00:21:00.02 --> 00:21:09.30
But the tactical advance was still in general concentrated one. This is, you know, we're

242
00:21:09.30 --> 00:21:14.98
starting in a decentralized command. And you know, I mentioned Borsay already Biel, you are CET.

243
00:21:14.98 --> 00:21:23.54
He's another French general, 1700s. I think you, yeah, born in 1700 died in 1780, but this is

244
00:21:23.54 --> 00:21:29.70
another guy that had a little bit of vision, right? Had a vision about decentralized command,

245
00:21:29.70 --> 00:21:35.54
and that's kind of one of them. This divisional system, where you can start to get people to move

246
00:21:35.54 --> 00:21:43.30
on their own. And that is a better way to advance. Back to the book, toward the end of, oh, and by the

247
00:21:43.30 --> 00:21:49.46
way, to Dave's point, we know where we're going. And if you lose, if you got your division and

248
00:21:49.46 --> 00:21:55.06
Ecos got his division and carries got his division and you lose comms with me, it doesn't matter

249
00:21:55.06 --> 00:21:57.70
three days later, you're very supposed to be because you knew where you were going.

250
00:22:00.26 --> 00:22:04.26
Back to the book, toward the end of the 19th century with a development of fire weapons,

251
00:22:04.26 --> 00:22:09.46
the tactical advance became dispersed, i.e. and particles to diminish the effective fires.

252
00:22:09.46 --> 00:22:17.46
This is when we really start to get to dispersion. But the strategic advance had become concentrated.

253
00:22:17.46 --> 00:22:20.90
This would do partly to the influence of railways and growth of the masses,

254
00:22:21.86 --> 00:22:27.14
partly to the misunderstanding of the Napoleonic methods. So when we started to use machine guns,

255
00:22:27.78 --> 00:22:32.90
well, then people started dispersing tactically, but because of trains, we are moving these

256
00:22:32.90 --> 00:22:39.62
mass groups together. A revival of the distributed advance was required in order to

257
00:22:39.62 --> 00:22:46.18
revive the art and effective strategy. Moreover, new conditions, air power, and motor power,

258
00:22:46.18 --> 00:22:51.06
point to its further development into a dispersed strategic advance.

259
00:22:52.58 --> 00:22:58.02
The danger of air attack, the aim of mystification and the need of drawing full value from

260
00:22:58.02 --> 00:23:02.98
mechanizability suggests that advancing forces should not only be distributed as widely as

261
00:23:02.98 --> 00:23:10.50
as is compatible with combined action, but be dispersed as much is compatible with cohesion.

262
00:23:10.50 --> 00:23:15.38
So what they're saying, there's a balance that you have to have. We got to be as far apart as we possibly

263
00:23:15.38 --> 00:23:21.30
can, but as long as we're still a cohesive unit, that's the dichotomy that you have to balance.

264
00:23:23.46 --> 00:23:27.46
This becomes essential in the face of atomic weapons, obviously we can't be all together because we

265
00:23:27.46 --> 00:23:35.86
could get nooks. It's crazy that we sit here and chuckle at that, because for us, it's almost like

266
00:23:35.86 --> 00:23:42.26
hey, that couldn't happen, but hey, and we've covered, we've covered some significant military

267
00:23:42.26 --> 00:23:48.66
manuals where they talk about the actual, their planning on how they're going to maneuver when

268
00:23:48.66 --> 00:23:56.34
the enemy is using tactical nukes, which is crazy to think about. The development of radio

269
00:23:56.34 --> 00:24:03.62
is a timely aid towards reconciling dispersion with control. Instead of the simple idea of concentrated

270
00:24:03.62 --> 00:24:11.70
stroke by a concentrated force, we should choose according to circumstances between these variants

271
00:24:11.70 --> 00:24:19.30
and give some options here. Dispursed advanced with concentrated single aim. IE against one

272
00:24:19.30 --> 00:24:24.74
objective. Dispursed advanced with concentrated serial aim, which means when we get there

273
00:24:24.74 --> 00:24:30.50
we're going to go off their multiple successive objectives. Dispursed advanced with distributed

274
00:24:30.50 --> 00:24:38.98
aim, IE against a number of objectives simultaneously. The effectiveness of armies depends on the

275
00:24:38.98 --> 00:24:46.34
development of such new methods, methods which aim at permeating and dominating areas, rather than

276
00:24:46.34 --> 00:24:53.78
capturing lines. At the practical object of paralyzing the enemy's action rather than the theoretical

277
00:24:53.78 --> 00:25:03.46
object of crushing his forces. Fluidity of forces may succeed where concentration of force

278
00:25:03.46 --> 00:25:14.58
merely entails rigidity, a perilous rigidity. So at times, Bruce Lee, we want to be like water.

279
00:25:15.70 --> 00:25:21.38
Fluidity of force is sometimes better than just concentration of force. If you can move

280
00:25:21.38 --> 00:25:27.78
Jeff Glover on the jujitsu mats, you grab something on him and he's somewhere else.

281
00:25:27.78 --> 00:25:36.74
You grab something on Dean, he's countering. You grab something on Jeffy Glover, he's maneuvering.

282
00:25:36.74 --> 00:25:46.02
Like it's gone. It's like a piece of slime. You squeeze one part, he pops out another part.

283
00:25:47.30 --> 00:25:50.82
With Dean, you can't squeeze. Like it doesn't go anyone. He does the squeezing.

284
00:25:50.82 --> 00:26:00.18
Yeah, you're getting squeezed. That's the way it worked. All right. Just the word fluid. And I mentioned

285
00:26:00.18 --> 00:26:06.74
before, I talked about fluid moves to sport. Just the idea of being fluid is it's flexibility.

286
00:26:06.74 --> 00:26:11.78
It's the ability to be reactive to the situation in a way that puts you in a place to be

287
00:26:12.66 --> 00:26:19.62
available to support as you need it. But far enough away to maneuver as you need to. And I just

288
00:26:19.62 --> 00:26:27.54
think the idea of in this era, I'm talking about fluid when the backdrop of Warver 1.

289
00:26:27.54 --> 00:26:30.90
And I know we've hit this a thousand times the backdrop of Warver 1 was

290
00:26:32.66 --> 00:26:42.98
was whatever the opposite of fluid is. The inability to adjust to maneuver to do something,

291
00:26:43.70 --> 00:26:48.26
that analogy you did was like that slime thing of ice squeeze here and something pops it over there.

292
00:26:48.26 --> 00:26:57.62
That the being the ability to be fluid and the inherent the way you'd want to describe

293
00:26:57.62 --> 00:27:02.98
the organization or your reaction to things go on in your organization of being fluid and how

294
00:27:02.98 --> 00:27:09.86
quickly people get to being rigid with their thought processes, their ideas, their objectives,

295
00:27:09.86 --> 00:27:12.98
what they want to accomplish and how quickly it becomes rigid.

296
00:27:12.98 --> 00:27:22.18
So, so check this out. We're in World War 1, okay? We actually have a culture

297
00:27:23.38 --> 00:27:33.06
that views fluidity as weakness. The Victorian culture, if you want to run away from danger,

298
00:27:33.06 --> 00:27:41.46
you're a coward. You're weak. Now take that and bring a thread to the boardroom, bring a thread

299
00:27:41.46 --> 00:27:48.10
to the conference room in a company. And if Dave presents an idea to me and I back down because I

300
00:27:48.10 --> 00:27:53.86
agree with his idea or I back down because I see some holes in my idea, I might be viewed as weak.

301
00:27:54.42 --> 00:27:57.62
So I'm not going to be fluid instead. I'm going to be rigid. I'm going to stand up to Dave. We're

302
00:27:57.62 --> 00:28:04.42
going to fight about it. And by the way, if I rank you, I'm going to win. It's freaking ridiculous.

303
00:28:04.42 --> 00:28:10.58
Crazy. But we have this culture and that culture, you know, look, the culture, the reason that

304
00:28:10.58 --> 00:28:18.66
culture exists, especially the culture of rigidity, is directly tied to our human nature, our ego,

305
00:28:18.66 --> 00:28:23.46
right? Because we feel like, oh, I don't want to, I'm not going to back down to Dave. I'm not going

306
00:28:23.46 --> 00:28:28.58
to let that happen. It's like, actually, you know, a good call, Dave, I like your idea better.

307
00:28:30.10 --> 00:28:37.46
The odd thing about this is that it makes me look stronger. It makes me look open-minded and flexible

308
00:28:37.46 --> 00:28:41.78
and confident to be like, you know what, Dave? Like your idea. Let's roll with that. The whole room,

309
00:28:41.78 --> 00:28:45.86
the whole freaking conference room goes damn. Jack was got some confidence. He's good with

310
00:28:45.86 --> 00:28:50.34
whatever plan. He just wants us to win as opposed to actually Dave. You know what? I've heard

311
00:28:50.34 --> 00:28:56.10
enough from you. We're going with my plan. Every one in the room goes, oh, he's weak. I think I'm

312
00:28:56.10 --> 00:29:02.90
strong. I'm being weak. And everybody perceives me as weak. Everybody perceives me. This is the

313
00:29:02.90 --> 00:29:10.50
one of the hardest lessons to learn. This one of the hardest lessons to learn is that flexibility

314
00:29:11.54 --> 00:29:17.46
is viewed as a strength. Fluidity is viewed as a strength. Putting your ego and being humble is

315
00:29:17.46 --> 00:29:21.70
viewed as strength. And when you do the opposite, when you're rigid, it's viewed as weakness. When

316
00:29:21.70 --> 00:29:27.70
you let your ego flare up, it's viewed as weakness. It's viewed as insecurity. And we see this all day

317
00:29:27.70 --> 00:29:42.98
long. We see this all day long. Jack. Next chapter. The concentrated essence of strategy and tactics.

318
00:29:45.86 --> 00:29:49.62
Do I own role? Realty's for my book. Do I? I think I kind of. At first I was like,

319
00:29:49.62 --> 00:29:59.14
yeah, but then now it may be to the children and descendants of Beech the Del Hart. Unfortunately for

320
00:29:59.14 --> 00:30:06.90
you, this book was published over 50 years ago. So we are cleared. And I apologize. But that's where we're at.

321
00:30:09.78 --> 00:30:14.58
Hopefully people will buy this book and you'll get some support. It's fantastic.

322
00:30:14.58 --> 00:30:20.74
This brief chapter is a temp to epitomize from the history of war. And as soon as you hear

323
00:30:20.74 --> 00:30:25.94
this day, you're going to kind of be like, oh, here we go. This brief chapter is an attempt to

324
00:30:25.94 --> 00:30:32.42
epitomize from the history of war, a few truths of experience, which seem so universal and so

325
00:30:32.42 --> 00:30:40.10
fundamental as to be termed axioms. They are practical guides, not abstract principles.

326
00:30:40.10 --> 00:30:45.14
Napoleon realized that only the practical is useful when he gave us his maxams.

327
00:30:47.14 --> 00:30:51.06
But the modern tendency, which we call upon, we are not going to ask you, we covered the

328
00:30:51.06 --> 00:30:56.58
Napoleon's maxams on this podcast. You can Google it since echo does not know. No, do I.

329
00:30:57.30 --> 00:31:05.86
Check. The modern tendency has been to search for principles which can be expressed in a single word.

330
00:31:05.86 --> 00:31:12.98
And then need several thousands words to explain them. Even so these principles are so

331
00:31:12.98 --> 00:31:18.42
abstract that they may mean different things to different men. And for any value depend on the

332
00:31:18.42 --> 00:31:24.02
individual's own understanding of war. The longer one continues to search for such omnipotent

333
00:31:24.02 --> 00:31:30.98
abstract abstractions, the more do they appear on mirage, neither attainable, nor useful,

334
00:31:30.98 --> 00:31:37.86
except as an intellectual exercise. These principles of war, not merely one principle,

335
00:31:37.86 --> 00:31:43.46
can be condensed into a single word concentration. So he's saying this word concentration,

336
00:31:43.46 --> 00:31:47.70
which we all learn concentration of forces. He's saying, good day. All these principles

337
00:31:47.70 --> 00:31:51.86
and put them into the word concentration. Okay. Let's start there. But for truth,

338
00:31:52.98 --> 00:31:59.46
this needs to be amplified as the concentration of strength against weakness. And for any real

339
00:31:59.46 --> 00:32:03.06
value it needs to be explained that the concentration of strength against weakness depends on the

340
00:32:03.06 --> 00:32:08.02
dispersion of your opponent's strength, which in turn is produced by a distribution of your own,

341
00:32:08.02 --> 00:32:13.70
that gives the appearance and partial effective dispersion. Your dispersion, his dispersion,

342
00:32:13.70 --> 00:32:19.94
your concentration, such as the sequence and equal and each is the sequel. True concentration is

343
00:32:19.94 --> 00:32:22.90
a force of calculated dispersion. So he's saying even though it's really easy to say

344
00:32:22.90 --> 00:32:28.66
kind of concentration, it's like, oh, there's a lot more going on than that. Yeah. Here we have

345
00:32:28.66 --> 00:32:35.78
a fundamental principle whose understanding may prevent a fundamental error and the most common

346
00:32:35.78 --> 00:32:40.90
that of giving your opponent freedom and time to concentrate to meet your concentration.

347
00:32:42.82 --> 00:32:49.78
This is why when you cover and move, you put down covering fire. And then the other element moves.

348
00:32:49.78 --> 00:32:56.02
Why? It's that covering fire that doesn't allow the enemy to maneuver to meet your concentration.

349
00:32:56.02 --> 00:33:04.18
But to state that the principle is not much practical aid for execution.

350
00:33:05.38 --> 00:33:10.98
The above mentioned axioms here expressed as maximums cannot be condensed into a single word,

351
00:33:10.98 --> 00:33:16.02
but they can be put into the fewest words necessary to be practical. Eight in all.

352
00:33:16.90 --> 00:33:21.06
So far, six are positive. Eight in all so far. It's interesting. He's saying like, hey,

353
00:33:21.06 --> 00:33:25.70
this is probably going to change. But this is where we're at. So far, six are positive and two are

354
00:33:25.70 --> 00:33:31.94
negative. They apply to tactics as well as strategy unless otherwise indicated. Number one.

355
00:33:33.14 --> 00:33:38.66
And these are the positive ones. Number one, adjust your end to your means.

356
00:33:41.62 --> 00:33:49.78
Adjust your end to your means. This is another thing that's, you got to know your objective.

357
00:33:49.78 --> 00:33:53.86
You got to stick to your objective. He's actually saying, look, man, you got to make some adjustments.

358
00:33:53.86 --> 00:34:01.06
You're, your end may change based upon your means. And here's what he says. In determining

359
00:34:01.06 --> 00:34:06.50
your object, clear sight and cool calculation should prevail. Wouldn't that be nice?

360
00:34:07.78 --> 00:34:14.74
It is folly to quote, bite off more than you can chew and quote, and the beginning of military

361
00:34:14.74 --> 00:34:23.46
wisdom is a sense of what is possible. That's the beginning of military wisdom. What's actually

362
00:34:23.46 --> 00:34:31.30
possible? And this is where you, you know, you can get into some, you know, theoretical

363
00:34:32.42 --> 00:34:36.34
ideas about, but if you believe it. It's like, no, and it's actually interesting. I remember

364
00:34:36.34 --> 00:34:46.42
at the early musters. I got asked about this and I explained belief as seeing an actual pathway

365
00:34:46.42 --> 00:34:54.18
to victory. You, you've got to believe means you can actually see an actual pathway, a viable pathway

366
00:34:54.18 --> 00:34:59.78
to achieve what you're talking about. Because to think, you know what, I want to be an astronaut.

367
00:35:01.06 --> 00:35:10.58
Like right now, I'm 49 years old. I guess I could figure out a, not, not really. I probably

368
00:35:10.58 --> 00:35:17.22
have a better chance of becoming an astronaut than an NBA player, right? Same. So is there? Okay,

369
00:35:17.22 --> 00:35:23.46
same. Thanks for the support bro. Is there a viable pathway for me to become an NBA player?

370
00:35:23.46 --> 00:35:33.22
Not really. Not really. So therefore, I need to adjust the end a little bit. Find something a little

371
00:35:33.22 --> 00:35:43.06
more feasible. He goes on to say, so learn, so learn to face facts while still preserve faith.

372
00:35:44.26 --> 00:35:49.54
There will be ample need for faith. The faith that can achieve the apparent impossible

373
00:35:49.54 --> 00:35:55.30
when action begins. So look, we got to have a positive attitude. Confidence is like the current

374
00:35:55.30 --> 00:36:01.22
in a battery, avoid exhausting it in vain effort. And remember that your own continued confidence

375
00:36:01.22 --> 00:36:08.58
will be of no avail if the cells of your battery, the men upon whom you depend, have been run down.

376
00:36:10.58 --> 00:36:18.34
So this is a, again, there's very few people that would think that the military mind should focus on

377
00:36:18.34 --> 00:36:25.62
hey, I might have to adjust what I'm trying to get to because it seems like the military is

378
00:36:25.62 --> 00:36:34.02
more, you know, like we're going to get this done. Like no, this is the number one, the number one

379
00:36:34.02 --> 00:36:40.50
axiom he's talking about, adjust your end to your means. Number two, keep your object always in mind.

380
00:36:40.50 --> 00:36:46.98
Now this is a dichotomy, right? Keep your your your object always in mind while adapting your

381
00:36:46.98 --> 00:36:53.62
plan to circumstances. Realize that there are more, we realize that there are more ways than one

382
00:36:53.62 --> 00:36:59.94
of gaining an object, an object, but take heed that every objective should bear on the object.

383
00:37:01.78 --> 00:37:12.98
And in considering this, just just real quick, if you as a leader can understand the fact that

384
00:37:12.98 --> 00:37:17.54
there's more ways than one of gaining an object, your life just got a thousand times more easy.

385
00:37:17.54 --> 00:37:24.10
Mm-hmm. Just got a thousand times easier. I've seen countless leaders

386
00:37:26.34 --> 00:37:33.62
think that they know the way and want to do something a certain way and waste time and effort

387
00:37:33.62 --> 00:37:39.38
and resources and most important waste leadership capital to get something done a certain way

388
00:37:39.38 --> 00:37:45.78
when my attitude is like, I don't care. I don't care how you want to get this done. I don't care.

389
00:37:45.78 --> 00:37:50.42
This is what we want to get done. How do you want to do it? Cool. Sounds good. It's a viable plan.

390
00:37:50.98 --> 00:37:55.14
It's a minimally viable plan. Dave's plan, you know what? I might do it differently.

391
00:37:55.14 --> 00:38:00.18
Dave's plan looks like it'll work too cool. And by the way, do we know your plan is going to work

392
00:38:00.18 --> 00:38:04.18
perfectly? No, we don't. Do I know my plan is going to work perfectly? No, we don't. So why am I

393
00:38:04.18 --> 00:38:08.10
going to invest a bunch of resources and time and effort and arguing and leadership capital?

394
00:38:08.10 --> 00:38:13.06
Trying to convince you to use my plan and set a year plan when they're both a freaking gamble.

395
00:38:13.06 --> 00:38:26.98
Don't waste your time. Connecting, connecting those two, I guess, axioms together or those

396
00:38:28.02 --> 00:38:33.54
those fundamental things from a leadership standpoint of, and we even talked about this, you know,

397
00:38:33.54 --> 00:38:40.18
from as a leader showing people a path to the end state that might not happen today,

398
00:38:40.18 --> 00:38:43.86
might happen tomorrow, but it's possible if you're going to say, hey, let's bring you to the three of us.

399
00:38:43.86 --> 00:38:53.22
We're going to be $100 million company. And I've got no way to show you how that's going to happen

400
00:38:53.22 --> 00:39:02.50
other than either just belief or faith or hope for a miracle or, hey, this one product,

401
00:39:02.50 --> 00:39:07.30
this is going to be. We're going to have this magical product and this is going to work. And I

402
00:39:07.30 --> 00:39:13.06
could also say, hey, listen, our goal, we want to be $100 million company. Let me tell you,

403
00:39:13.06 --> 00:39:17.78
what's going to, what we're going to have to do right now, we're not. We're going to do this in this.

404
00:39:18.34 --> 00:39:21.94
And that's going to allow us to bring in this other group, maybe get an acquisition here.

405
00:39:21.94 --> 00:39:24.82
And you can start to lay out this path and people, and I've seen it in those rooms where you see

406
00:39:24.82 --> 00:39:29.22
the leaders lay out the path to getting there, not the exact steps we're going to take, but what,

407
00:39:29.22 --> 00:39:34.90
we, and all of a sudden people go, oh, oh, yeah, we can do that. And that's going to lead to this.

408
00:39:34.90 --> 00:39:40.10
And then we bring in more people and we bring in more resources. We bring in another company that does this,

409
00:39:40.10 --> 00:39:45.70
just laying out the steps. So people in their minds understand, and I'm just saying this because

410
00:39:45.70 --> 00:39:53.46
of the word viable, the, the, the, the, the value of people saying, oh, that's actually not crazy.

411
00:39:53.46 --> 00:39:59.46
What you're saying is not this magic crazy pipe dream. I can actually see how if we do this. And then

412
00:39:59.46 --> 00:40:05.06
if I, on that second step of as a subordinate leader, understand what you're trying to accomplish.

413
00:40:05.06 --> 00:40:08.58
And you're not here saying turn left to your chin right here, do this. And not telling me what to do,

414
00:40:09.70 --> 00:40:14.18
or how to do it. You're just telling me the end state that we want. Then I actually get to be the

415
00:40:14.18 --> 00:40:18.98
one that drives us to that goal. That is actually so much more believable now because it's viable

416
00:40:18.98 --> 00:40:22.90
because you lay that out. And then let me, let me move towards that objective.

417
00:40:22.90 --> 00:40:30.90
Here's a detail that I just picked up on taking what you said when you said what I said back to me.

418
00:40:30.90 --> 00:40:38.10
And I was like, oh, there's an, there's an error in what I said. When I, when I said a belief is

419
00:40:39.22 --> 00:40:48.02
seeing a path to victory. What it should actually be is seeing paths plural to victory.

420
00:40:48.02 --> 00:40:50.82
But in the reason I thought of this is because as you're sitting here talking about, well,

421
00:40:50.82 --> 00:40:56.02
if I say, okay, Dave, we're going to make a $100,000 company. And you go, oh, that sounds

422
00:40:56.02 --> 00:41:02.82
awesome. Come in. Yeah. But how are we going to do that? And I lay out one single path to get us there.

423
00:41:04.74 --> 00:41:10.18
You know, that's cool. Everything. But your, your faith in that is going to go down a little bit.

424
00:41:10.18 --> 00:41:16.50
But if I say, hey, listen, here's our five different lines of operations. And here's what

425
00:41:16.50 --> 00:41:21.38
each one of these things are going to produce. And you know what, chances are Dave, one or two of these

426
00:41:21.38 --> 00:41:26.34
might fail completely. They're good ideas. I like them. But we don't haven't gone far enough

427
00:41:26.34 --> 00:41:31.46
down them to really understand. But we know that of these ideas, we have made some progress in all of them.

428
00:41:31.46 --> 00:41:36.82
And we see potential. So if two or three of these paths go the way we want them to, we're going to be

429
00:41:36.82 --> 00:41:42.10
right where we want to be. We're going to get that $100 million. So even, you know, going back to the

430
00:41:42.10 --> 00:41:50.34
last podcast, having multiple avenues of approach is highly beneficial to your belief system

431
00:41:51.54 --> 00:41:57.70
being distributed and how you go to an objective. Right. Right. Having more than one objective,

432
00:41:57.70 --> 00:42:04.18
having more than one pathway to that objective. Yeah. And by the way, also saying, look, we might,

433
00:42:04.18 --> 00:42:07.30
we might not make this one objective over here. But we're still going to get where we want to be.

434
00:42:07.30 --> 00:42:15.94
Okay. Same maximum here, continuing on. And in considering possible objectives,

435
00:42:15.94 --> 00:42:22.42
way their possibility of attainment with their service to the object if attained to wander down

436
00:42:22.42 --> 00:42:31.30
a side track as bad, but to reach a dead end is worse. So especially if the dead end is the only

437
00:42:31.30 --> 00:42:36.18
pathway that you've got. Yeah. That's why I have in a couple different pathways is smart. Number three,

438
00:42:36.18 --> 00:42:43.06
choose the line or course of least expectation. Try to put yourself in the enemy shoes and think

439
00:42:43.06 --> 00:42:50.34
what course is least probable he will foresee or forstall. Number four, exploit the line of least

440
00:42:50.34 --> 00:42:58.74
resistance. So long as it can lead you to any objective, which would contribute to your underlying

441
00:42:58.74 --> 00:43:02.98
object. Right. Oh, yeah. It's cool path of least resistance, but it's got to be going on in the right

442
00:43:02.98 --> 00:43:08.98
direction. And tactics, this maximum applies to the use of your reserves and in strategy, the exploitation

443
00:43:08.98 --> 00:43:16.74
of tactical success. Number five, take a line of operation, which offers alternative objectives.

444
00:43:16.74 --> 00:43:22.34
Okay. Sorry, we went a little ahead on that one. For you, we'll thus put your opponent on the

445
00:43:22.34 --> 00:43:27.94
horns of dilemma. It just comes from last podcast, which goes far to assure the chance of gaining one

446
00:43:27.94 --> 00:43:33.94
objective at least, whichever he guards least and may enable you to gain one after the other.

447
00:43:33.94 --> 00:43:39.14
Because once you get one, like we make it in one line of operation and now we made a bunch of money.

448
00:43:39.14 --> 00:43:42.50
Cool. Guess what? We can invest in that other thing that was a little bit harder out of the gate,

449
00:43:42.50 --> 00:43:45.22
but now we have the money to spend on it and we can make it happen. Yeah.

450
00:43:48.02 --> 00:43:53.46
Alternative objectives allow you to keep the opportunity of gaining an objective. Whereas a

451
00:43:53.46 --> 00:43:58.58
single objective, unless the enemy has helplessly inferior, means the certainty that you will not gain it.

452
00:43:58.58 --> 00:44:02.18
Once the enemy is no longer uncertain as to your aim. As soon as the enemy knows what you're doing,

453
00:44:02.18 --> 00:44:07.14
your chances of success go down dramatically, unless they're helplessly inferior.

454
00:44:08.82 --> 00:44:15.14
There is no more common mistake than to confuse a single line of operation, which is usually wise

455
00:44:15.14 --> 00:44:25.38
with a single objective, which is usually futile. Number six on the last of the positive

456
00:44:25.38 --> 00:44:33.30
maxims, ensure that both plans and dispositions are flexible, adaptable to circumstances.

457
00:44:33.86 --> 00:44:39.14
And by dispositions, I'm just like where you're putting people. Your plan should foresee and

458
00:44:39.14 --> 00:44:43.54
provide for a next step in case of success or failure or a partial success, which is the most

459
00:44:43.54 --> 00:44:48.50
common case in war. Your dispositions or reformation should be such as to allow this exploitation

460
00:44:48.50 --> 00:44:55.46
or adaptation in the shortest possible time. People will argue and fight and struggle with trying

461
00:44:55.46 --> 00:44:59.94
to figure out how they're going to task organized, a group of people. Like, well, no, actually

462
00:44:59.94 --> 00:45:02.98
Dave, I think this person should report today, and this person should report to Dave, and this

463
00:45:02.98 --> 00:45:07.86
person should report to me. We can argue about that stuff all the way all day long. And by the way,

464
00:45:07.86 --> 00:45:16.10
your past, I'm past and guess what? It's our company. And I go, you know what, Dave, you go ahead,

465
00:45:16.82 --> 00:45:20.42
that person can report to you. Cool. That sounds good. And you look up at me in two weeks and you're like,

466
00:45:21.70 --> 00:45:24.18
this doesn't really make much sense. I'm okay, cool. They can report. You know, like,

467
00:45:24.90 --> 00:45:29.30
you don't, it's not set in stone. You don't get a tattoo on your forehead of your task organization.

468
00:45:30.66 --> 00:45:35.54
And by the way, it doesn't look, quote, look bad to say, hey, you know what, Fred, you're going to be

469
00:45:35.54 --> 00:45:39.46
working for Dave. And then a month later, say, hey, Fred, it seems like your expertise is really

470
00:45:39.46 --> 00:45:42.74
going to be a little bit more beneficial to life. And what he's got going on, we're going to shift

471
00:45:42.74 --> 00:45:49.46
you over there. Now, do you want to do this every two weeks? No, obviously not. But to put some

472
00:45:49.46 --> 00:45:55.62
in a position or task organization is an organized in a certain way and have it flexible,

473
00:45:56.66 --> 00:46:02.34
flexible dispositions. That's exactly what it is. Is the smart way to do things. And obviously,

474
00:46:02.34 --> 00:46:11.70
it's with a flexible plan as well. The negatives do not throw your weight into a stroke whilst

475
00:46:11.70 --> 00:46:18.66
your opponent is on guard, whilst he is well placed to Perry or evade it. The experience of history

476
00:46:18.66 --> 00:46:23.46
shows that save against a much inferior opponent, no effective stroke is possible until his power

477
00:46:23.46 --> 00:46:28.26
of resistance or evasion is paralyzed. Hence, no commander should launch a real attack upon an

478
00:46:28.26 --> 00:46:35.94
enemy in position until satisfied that such a paralysis has developed. It is produced by disorganization

479
00:46:35.94 --> 00:46:44.10
and its moral equivalent, demoralization of the enemy. So cool, set it up, set up the move,

480
00:46:45.62 --> 00:46:51.14
eight. And the last one do not renew an attack along the same line or in the same form,

481
00:46:51.14 --> 00:46:57.22
after it is once failed. A mere reinforcement of weight is not a sufficient change for it is

482
00:46:57.22 --> 00:47:02.42
probable that the enemy also will have strength in itself in the interval. It is even more

483
00:47:02.42 --> 00:47:09.54
probable that it is success in repulsing you will have strength in the morally. It is one of my

484
00:47:09.54 --> 00:47:17.70
favorite coaching moves in jujitsu. Do it harder. I was saying that to carry the other day.

485
00:47:18.42 --> 00:47:24.02
Like he is like grabbing your wrist. A grab that thing harder. It hasn't helped him for six minutes

486
00:47:24.02 --> 00:47:30.34
grabbing the wrist while he is in your guard. But if he doesn't harder, that might work.

487
00:47:30.34 --> 00:47:34.42
That's what this is. Like it didn't work. It's not going to work. Don't do it harder.

488
00:47:35.06 --> 00:47:38.18
Just because you add, hey, you know what we spend a much money on advertising.

489
00:47:39.46 --> 00:47:46.26
We haven't seen any bump in our sales. Let's spend more.

490
00:47:47.94 --> 00:47:52.10
I guess the only thing that surprised me is from the guy who is in World War I,

491
00:47:52.10 --> 00:47:56.50
that that was a number of weeks. Yes. Like the first thing he says is hey,

492
00:47:57.06 --> 00:48:03.54
don't do it. We did it for three straight years. Yeah. Maybe that's why it's his last point. Yeah.

493
00:48:04.34 --> 00:48:13.54
Like hey, by the way, you freaking idiot is all the other stuff. Cool. Listen, you freaking idiots.

494
00:48:13.54 --> 00:48:18.74
If it doesn't work, don't keep doing it. If it didn't work with 10,000 men, it's not going

495
00:48:18.74 --> 00:48:23.62
to work with 20,000 men. It's crazy. You can see how you get sucked into that. Tell me, yeah.

496
00:48:23.62 --> 00:48:29.14
Yeah. You're liking it. What? The way you get sucked into it is when you commit yourself

497
00:48:29.14 --> 00:48:33.54
to the outcome of your plan. This plan is going to achieve this outcome.

498
00:48:34.34 --> 00:48:40.66
And if I allocate, I work for you. Hey, this is a plan. We're going to do I allocate resources

499
00:48:40.66 --> 00:48:47.54
and doesn't work. Well, I can either abandon that plan, make me look weak. Like I owe it,

500
00:48:47.54 --> 00:48:52.02
or I can go, hey, we're going to allocate more resources and more resources and more resources,

501
00:48:52.02 --> 00:48:56.74
more resources because I'm inflexible to say, well, actually, maybe I didn't connect my ends to my

502
00:48:56.74 --> 00:49:00.26
means to the end and I might maybe didn't do just something, might need to do something different.

503
00:49:00.26 --> 00:49:05.62
Or a group or reassess or come in from a different direction. As opposed to saying, hey,

504
00:49:05.62 --> 00:49:10.10
you know what? Hey, boss, that plan didn't work. Let me take a step back. We need to kind of see

505
00:49:10.10 --> 00:49:13.62
what we did here with this marketing scheme. It didn't have the effect that we want. And before we

506
00:49:13.62 --> 00:49:17.38
start putting in more resources, let me get a better assess for what's going on. And kind of

507
00:49:17.38 --> 00:49:22.42
give that to you. And it may be that we do the same thing, but we're probably going to need to make some

508
00:49:22.42 --> 00:49:31.22
changes. Yeah, at least quantify your efforts, right? It's really disturbing because it really

509
00:49:31.22 --> 00:49:38.90
is one of these things where it is so tempting when you get close, you feel like the pressure

510
00:49:38.90 --> 00:49:43.38
like you try an arm lock and you almost got it. You try it again. It's like the person

511
00:49:43.38 --> 00:49:47.94
defended at once. The person that's going to defend it again. You spend that money in marketing.

512
00:49:47.94 --> 00:49:54.34
You spend that money. And you, you saw a little bit of an uptick, but it's not quite what you

513
00:49:54.34 --> 00:50:00.18
wanted, but still maybe we just put more money into it. I'm listening, I'm listening to you

514
00:50:00.18 --> 00:50:05.22
talk about some of those things. And I'm almost trying to think of what is the human nature to do

515
00:50:05.22 --> 00:50:13.30
that. And I think some of it is, is we kind of glorify this single-minded, this, yeah, I think

516
00:50:13.30 --> 00:50:19.86
it's similar. The things, there's like this glorification of, I refuse to give in. I refuse to

517
00:50:19.86 --> 00:50:26.18
give up. I refuse to tap. I refuse to accept defeat. And so my answer is going to be, I'm just

518
00:50:26.18 --> 00:50:31.30
going to send more. I'm going to send more and more. And I think the times that that perseverance

519
00:50:31.30 --> 00:50:38.26
pays off, there's some sort of like glorification of that single-mindedness went in reality.

520
00:50:38.26 --> 00:50:48.90
Okay. How much weaker does it make us look by being unwilling to say, hang on. I think there's

521
00:50:48.90 --> 00:50:54.90
a flaw in my plan. Let me just, I need to take a step back and rethink this. I'm missing something.

522
00:50:54.90 --> 00:50:59.86
I'm missing something. And the weakness that that shows, and you were talking about the before

523
00:50:59.86 --> 00:51:05.38
is that makes you look weak when they exact opposite is true. Yeah, well, I have a section

524
00:51:05.38 --> 00:51:12.50
and leadership strategy in tactics called when to quit. But I'm the big, no, never quit. Actually,

525
00:51:12.50 --> 00:51:19.70
totally wrong, totally wrong. When do you quit? Oh, this plan that we have is not working.

526
00:51:19.70 --> 00:51:24.74
We lost a guy two guys, three guys. This is stupid. Let's go in different direction.

527
00:51:26.10 --> 00:51:32.90
Now, just imagine doing that for battalions and brigades and divisions of soldiers, man. It's

528
00:51:32.90 --> 00:51:39.30
free for you. It is crazy. Just give us a lot of which we just had. If we just were to

529
00:51:39.30 --> 00:51:48.02
had another 10,000 soldiers at that moment, got it so tempting. Is it like, do you feel like it's

530
00:51:48.02 --> 00:51:52.98
maybe like, because it's like you say glorify, you know, never quit that, yeah, that never quit.

531
00:51:52.98 --> 00:51:58.74
And then they over-simplify it because you say persistence, right? Persistence always, you know,

532
00:51:58.74 --> 00:52:02.66
like, that's the way this guy was successful. He was just persistent, you know, fail fail.

533
00:52:02.66 --> 00:52:08.02
And by the way, the economy, right? It's a dichotomy. Like, you can say, oh, you know what?

534
00:52:08.02 --> 00:52:10.74
It didn't work the way we wanted to. Okay, screw it. We're going to go to something else. So there's

535
00:52:10.74 --> 00:52:14.10
a dichotomy in this. Right. You know, even when I was talking about like you go from the

536
00:52:14.10 --> 00:52:17.62
arm lock, you don't get it. You go from the arm lock, you don't get it. There's plenty of fights where

537
00:52:17.62 --> 00:52:22.10
the person went from the arm lock three, four times, finally they get it. Yeah. That's what I'm saying,

538
00:52:22.10 --> 00:52:26.18
where they oversimplify it, where they have all these cool things like, you know, if they

539
00:52:26.18 --> 00:52:30.74
fit first, you don't succeed, you know, try again or you know, all these things. But there's

540
00:52:30.74 --> 00:52:36.34
more to it than that. Some of those, yeah, some of the Pacific Island campaign. Hey, we should be

541
00:52:36.34 --> 00:52:42.74
done with this operation in three days. Cool. 19 days later, we're not even a quarter away

542
00:52:42.74 --> 00:52:49.38
where we've exposed to be. Like, guess what? We're going to present some more resources there.

543
00:52:49.38 --> 00:52:54.34
We're going to get it done. Oh, man. That's why this is even. This is a dichotomy. Totally.

544
00:52:54.34 --> 00:52:59.46
Yeah. So the persistence and the, you know, if at first you don't succeed, try and try again or

545
00:52:59.46 --> 00:53:06.82
whatever, the it's persistent, not in the same exact methodologies, like persistence, but you kind

546
00:53:06.82 --> 00:53:10.90
of got to make these little changes within that. But you can't really fit that in the little slogan,

547
00:53:10.90 --> 00:53:16.10
you know, a lot of time. I was just going to say, I mean, in very simplistic times,

548
00:53:16.90 --> 00:53:21.62
you know, I think that's one of the differences between the tactics and the strategies. I will

549
00:53:21.62 --> 00:53:28.10
abandon an tactic. And I will give up on a tactic very quickly if it, if it's the wrong tactic

550
00:53:28.10 --> 00:53:34.90
to get to the, now, giving up on a strategy is a very different thing. But giving up on the tactic

551
00:53:34.90 --> 00:53:40.74
or, or maybe it's not even the right word, but adjusting my tactics and adjusting the plan

552
00:53:40.74 --> 00:53:45.38
and getting feedback from the ones implementing the plan while sticking to the strategy or the

553
00:53:45.38 --> 00:53:50.58
or the long-term objective. Again, very simplistically, but the commitment to the tactic when you

554
00:53:50.58 --> 00:53:54.26
see people committing to the same thing over and over and over again, as opposed to going,

555
00:53:54.26 --> 00:53:58.18
hey, this tactic isn't working. Is there a better way to do this to accomplish that same end goal of

556
00:53:58.18 --> 00:54:04.66
what we want to become as a company or as a team? That difference for me is how often we see people

557
00:54:04.66 --> 00:54:09.38
unwilling to change their tactic. Yeah. When it's so obvious that they need to. And that's the exact,

558
00:54:09.38 --> 00:54:15.06
that's exactly in that section in leadership strategy and tactics. Once I explain like, hey,

559
00:54:15.06 --> 00:54:21.54
you need to quit what you're doing. That's failing. This doesn't mean you abandon your overall

560
00:54:21.54 --> 00:54:26.50
strategy. That's the actual words that I use to open it up. But that's, because that's 100% right.

561
00:54:27.22 --> 00:54:31.06
Just because I go, oh, you know what? This doesn't seem to be working, right? Look, when in

562
00:54:31.06 --> 00:54:37.62
World War One, it wasn't, hey, this isn't working. Let's surrender. No, it's, you know what?

563
00:54:37.62 --> 00:54:45.62
This isn't working. Let's figure out a different way to do this. Let's figure out a different way to attack. I think

564
00:54:45.62 --> 00:54:52.18
it's also just a freaking sanity check that you need to do. It's one of these things where,

565
00:54:52.18 --> 00:54:59.70
look, you beat your, I, you sense all the vogue as the, my limit for beating my head against the wall is

566
00:54:59.70 --> 00:55:04.18
47 times. Like once I've beat my head against the wall 47 times, like, okay,

567
00:55:04.18 --> 00:55:11.30
number 44, 45, 46. Okay, 47. This isn't going to work. I got to try something else. Like,

568
00:55:11.30 --> 00:55:15.70
you got to check yourself. What is that number? How much are you? How much money are you willing to

569
00:55:15.70 --> 00:55:20.50
throw into marketing? How big? How many more people are you willing to give to that leader that's failed?

570
00:55:21.54 --> 00:55:25.62
How many more projects are you, you know, like the, there's things we've got to check yourself.

571
00:55:25.62 --> 00:55:29.54
Is it for, have you beat your head against the wall 47 times? And if you had, have,

572
00:55:29.54 --> 00:55:37.54
don't go the 48 time, time to reevaluate your, your tactic. Doesn't mean you need to abandon what

573
00:55:37.54 --> 00:55:44.66
you're trying to do. Means you need to freaking check yourself. Back to the book. The essential

574
00:55:44.66 --> 00:55:52.66
truth underlying these maxims is that for success, two major problems must be solved, dislocation

575
00:55:52.66 --> 00:56:01.38
and exploitation. One precedes and one follows the actual blow, which in comparison is a simple act.

576
00:56:01.38 --> 00:56:06.98
So it's pretty easy to hit them. But you got to set up the hit and you got to exploit the hit once

577
00:56:06.98 --> 00:56:11.54
you've done. You cannot hit the enemy with effect until you have first created the opportunity. You

578
00:56:11.54 --> 00:56:18.82
cannot make that effect decisive unless you exploit the second opportunity that comes before he can recover.

579
00:56:18.82 --> 00:56:26.66
The importance of these two problems has never been adequately recognized. A fact which goes far

580
00:56:26.66 --> 00:56:34.42
to explain the common indesisiveness of warfare. So we don't make decisions because we don't

581
00:56:34.42 --> 00:56:40.66
understand how important it is that when echoes off balance, I better freaking attack or before I

582
00:56:40.66 --> 00:56:46.34
get them off balance, I need to set them up so I can get them off balance. The training of armies,

583
00:56:46.34 --> 00:56:52.34
this is freaking epic. The training of armies is primarily devoted to developing efficiency in the

584
00:56:52.34 --> 00:56:59.46
detailed execution of the attack. The concentration on tactical technique tends to obscure the

585
00:56:59.46 --> 00:57:07.30
psychological element. It fosters a cult of soundness rather than surprise. It bleeds. It breeds

586
00:57:07.30 --> 00:57:14.34
commanders who are so intent, not to do anything wrong according to the book that they forget

587
00:57:14.34 --> 00:57:20.58
the necessity of making the enemy do something wrong. The result is that their plans have no result

588
00:57:22.98 --> 00:57:29.22
for in war. It is by compelling mistakes that the scales are most often turned.

589
00:57:30.02 --> 00:57:35.30
Gotta make the person make mistakes. Here and there a commander has issued the obvious

590
00:57:36.74 --> 00:57:42.82
and is found in unexpected, in the unexpected, the key to a decision. Unless fortune has

591
00:57:42.82 --> 00:57:49.54
proved foul for luck can never be divorced for more since it's part of life. Hence, the unexpected

592
00:57:49.54 --> 00:57:56.58
cannot guarantee success, but it guarantees the best chance of success. That's why we're gonna surprise

593
00:57:56.58 --> 00:58:11.94
people. Next section, the national object and military aim. In, look, we talk about alignment a lot

594
00:58:11.94 --> 00:58:18.10
and this is where inside of an organization. This is really talking about alignment. As you hear

595
00:58:18.10 --> 00:58:24.74
us discuss this, thinking about alignment through your organization. This is what we have to be

596
00:58:24.74 --> 00:58:31.46
cognizant of as leaders. In discussing the subject of the objective in war, it is essential to be

597
00:58:31.46 --> 00:58:35.54
clear about and keep clear in our minds the distinction between the political and military objective.

598
00:58:35.54 --> 00:58:42.58
The two are different but not separate. For nations that, for nations do not weigh wage war

599
00:58:42.58 --> 00:58:48.50
for war's sake, but in pursuance of policy. The military objective is only the means to a political

600
00:58:48.50 --> 00:58:52.58
end. Hence, the military objective should be governed by the political objective.

601
00:58:52.58 --> 00:58:59.62
Subject to the basic condition that policy does not demand what is militarily that is practically

602
00:58:59.62 --> 00:59:07.30
impossible. So what are we trying to do in our company? What are we actually trying to do inside

603
00:59:07.30 --> 00:59:10.58
of our company? And if we're trying to do something inside of our company, does everybody on the

604
00:59:10.58 --> 00:59:16.34
team understand what we're trying to do? And are there maneuvers out there in support of what it is

605
00:59:16.34 --> 00:59:22.50
we're trying to do? Thus any study of the problem ought to begin and end with the question of policy.

606
00:59:22.50 --> 00:59:30.10
The term objective, although common usage, is not really a good one. It has a physical and

607
00:59:30.10 --> 00:59:35.78
geographical sense and thus tends to confuse thought. It would be better to speak of the object

608
00:59:36.82 --> 00:59:43.54
when dealing with the purpose of policy and of the military aim when dealing with the way

609
00:59:43.54 --> 00:59:49.22
that forces are directed in the service of policy. So I mentioned on the first podcast

610
00:59:49.22 --> 00:59:54.82
we did that he kind of goes into this objective versus object. And he uses the term object. I

611
00:59:54.82 --> 00:59:59.62
think it's not it's a little bit of an archaic way of using it. I mean it's only 19, whatever 30.

612
01:00:00.58 --> 01:00:07.54
But for us we use objective all the time and we definitely use it in a military sense. But to his

613
01:00:07.54 --> 01:00:15.70
point, objective we think of like airfield, right? We think of beachhead. So maybe it's a good idea.

614
01:00:15.70 --> 01:00:25.30
Well we'll go with it. The object in war is a better state of peace. Even if only from your own point of view.

615
01:00:25.30 --> 01:00:30.74
This is a, you know I always talk about climbing the ladder of alignment. This is the highest

616
01:00:30.74 --> 01:00:36.18
you can get and the ladder of alignment for war. The reason we're in war is because we want a better

617
01:00:36.18 --> 01:00:41.38
peace. That's what we're trying to do. Hence it is essential to conduct war with constant

618
01:00:41.38 --> 01:00:48.02
regard for your, for the peace you desire. This is the long, long, long term thinking.

619
01:00:49.46 --> 01:00:54.90
That applies to both to aggressor nations who seek expansion and to peaceful nations who only fight

620
01:00:54.90 --> 01:00:59.86
for self preservation, although their views of what is meant by a better state of peace are very

621
01:00:59.86 --> 01:01:06.74
different. History shows that gaining military victory is not in itself equivalent to gaining the

622
01:01:06.74 --> 01:01:13.54
object of policy. But as most of the thinking about war has been done by men of the military

623
01:01:13.54 --> 01:01:19.22
profession, there has been a very natural tendency to lose the site of basic national object and

624
01:01:19.22 --> 01:01:24.98
identify it with the military aim. So how does this happen inside of a business? We start the business.

625
01:01:24.98 --> 01:01:28.82
The people that are out there in the field trying to make things happen, they might lose sight of

626
01:01:28.82 --> 01:01:35.38
what it is we're trying to do. In consequence, whenever war is broken out, policy is too often

627
01:01:35.38 --> 01:01:41.30
been governed by the military aim and this has been regarded as an end in itself instead of

628
01:01:42.18 --> 01:01:51.62
as a merely a means to an end. Fast forward, a little bit for more than a century of

629
01:01:51.62 --> 01:01:58.10
the prime canon of military doctrine has been that has been that quote, the destruction of the

630
01:01:58.10 --> 01:02:06.82
enemy's main forces on the battlefield constituted the only true aim in war. That's what war is for.

631
01:02:07.38 --> 01:02:12.10
Just destroy the enemy, destroy the enemy forces on the battlefield, actually. That was universally

632
01:02:12.10 --> 01:02:16.82
accepted engraved in all military manuals and taught at all staff colleges. If any states

633
01:02:16.82 --> 01:02:22.42
been ventured to doubt whether it fitted the national object in all circumstances, he was regarded as

634
01:02:22.42 --> 01:02:28.74
blasphemy and violating holy rite as can be seen in studying the official records and memoirs

635
01:02:28.74 --> 01:02:33.70
of the military heads of the war nations, particularly in and after World War I.

636
01:02:35.78 --> 01:02:40.42
So absolute rule would have astonished the great commanders and teachers of war theory and

637
01:02:40.42 --> 01:02:46.50
ageers prior to the 19th century. For they had recognized the practical necessity of wisdom of

638
01:02:46.50 --> 01:02:52.02
adapting aims to limitations of strength and policy. Like how long we can try and fight this thing

639
01:02:52.02 --> 01:02:57.14
before saying, you know what, this is freaking not good. We're expanding all of our national treasure

640
01:02:57.14 --> 01:03:01.46
and we're not getting anywhere. This is a bad call. And now we're going to start hammering on

641
01:03:01.46 --> 01:03:10.66
cows fits again. Clause fits is influence. The rule acquired its dogmatic rigidity largely

642
01:03:10.66 --> 01:03:16.82
through the posthumous influence of closquits and his books upon the minds of Prussian soldiers,

643
01:03:16.82 --> 01:03:23.38
put particularly mokey and then more widely through the impact of their victories in 1866 and 1870

644
01:03:23.38 --> 01:03:27.94
made upon the armies of the world which copied so many features of the Prussian system, thus it is a

645
01:03:27.94 --> 01:03:35.70
vital importance to examine his theories. As so often happens, Clause which is disciples carried

646
01:03:35.70 --> 01:03:39.86
his teachings to an extreme which their master had not intended.

647
01:03:39.86 --> 01:03:48.74
Hmm. Miss interpretation has been the common fate of most profits and thinkers in every sphere,

648
01:03:48.74 --> 01:03:54.58
devout but uncompromising, oh sorry, devout but uncomprehending disciples

649
01:03:54.58 --> 01:04:01.46
have been more damaging to the original conception than even its prejudice and perblind opponents.

650
01:04:02.74 --> 01:04:09.22
So what happens? We get people that take things to the extreme. And they do more damage than the

651
01:04:09.22 --> 01:04:14.82
people that are against the idea. It must be admitted however that Clause wits invited

652
01:04:14.82 --> 01:04:25.54
misinterpretation more than most. Sorry Clause fits. A student of Kant at second hand he acquired

653
01:04:25.54 --> 01:04:30.82
a philosophical motive expression without developing a truly philosophical mind. Ouch.

654
01:04:31.86 --> 01:04:35.06
Sorry dude, his hammer in Clause was there. Clause wits has taken heavy's.

655
01:04:35.06 --> 01:04:39.54
How did you guys talk about Clause wits in a positive way?

656
01:04:39.54 --> 01:04:40.74
Yeah.

657
01:04:40.74 --> 01:04:47.70
Mostly, I mean the pull from Clause wits at the takeaway from that was there were components inside

658
01:04:47.70 --> 01:04:54.34
there that the things that he said makes sense and he talks about ends and me he talks about

659
01:04:54.34 --> 01:04:59.46
tactics and strategy and is really a good tool for people to understand. And the way the context

660
01:04:59.46 --> 01:05:03.30
we're using is actually I think very important and very similar to what he's saying is that

661
01:05:03.30 --> 01:05:12.66
the military which has this sort of outside recognition that's outside status of the

662
01:05:12.66 --> 01:05:18.02
the instead of being a tool to accomplish the political means or what the state wants.

663
01:05:18.02 --> 01:05:24.26
It's almost a means in and of itself as if the military exists for the military as opposed to

664
01:05:24.26 --> 01:05:29.46
this is a tool, one of many tools that actually accomplishes the political means which and

665
01:05:29.46 --> 01:05:37.70
to just kind of bring that back a little bit when he talked about the object being a greater piece

666
01:05:37.70 --> 01:05:42.74
or a better piece or whatever the term that you use and it's funny because I think I've evolved

667
01:05:42.74 --> 01:05:47.54
in my thinking when I hear objective I don't think bridge anymore, I don't think airfield anymore,

668
01:05:47.54 --> 01:05:51.38
I think goals I think outcome. So but I understand his point and I certainly remember in the

669
01:05:51.38 --> 01:05:55.94
beginning of my military career, what's the objective? Oh, to secure that bridge or to do whatever

670
01:05:55.94 --> 01:06:04.18
that particular thing is. If we've got a company and our company's object or our vision, our goal

671
01:06:04.18 --> 01:06:12.18
is to be the premier hardware producer for a product that every company the world needs for them to be

672
01:06:12.18 --> 01:06:16.18
successful and then I've got a sales team inside there and nobody's saying, well sales is like

673
01:06:16.66 --> 01:06:20.74
the most important thing we have, we got to sell this thing, it's the military version for this

674
01:06:20.74 --> 01:06:24.98
company and you're out there running the sales team and your objective is sell as many of these

675
01:06:24.98 --> 01:06:31.54
things as you can because that's obviously how we become the indispensable producer of this product

676
01:06:31.54 --> 01:06:35.06
that everybody's going to need and be the most reputable and reliable company in the world.

677
01:06:35.62 --> 01:06:39.54
But if you're out there selling this product and it hasn't been made yet because our

678
01:06:39.54 --> 01:06:44.82
operations team has been stood up or you're selling this and we don't have the support for the

679
01:06:44.82 --> 01:06:48.42
clients that are going to buy it to actually give them the tools that need or you're selling this

680
01:06:48.42 --> 01:06:53.30
and we don't have the software to update it and back it up, you can actually accomplish your

681
01:06:53.30 --> 01:06:59.70
objective by selling this product that doesn't help us achieve the object that doesn't actually help

682
01:06:59.70 --> 01:07:07.46
us be successful and I'm not defending cost-wits but there is the military is somebody's car

683
01:07:07.46 --> 01:07:16.90
I don't know that's all good. The the military in some ways has become this tool this means

684
01:07:16.90 --> 01:07:22.10
that sort of in and of itself is its own thing like the military exists to defeat you know to win

685
01:07:22.10 --> 01:07:26.98
wars and defeat the enemy and destroy battlefields. Once I see now it's one of several different ways

686
01:07:26.98 --> 01:07:31.70
and when you made that comment about the military is existance like the ideal thing you would

687
01:07:31.70 --> 01:07:37.30
think for the military is I want this military to exist to deter any potential opponent from

688
01:07:37.30 --> 01:07:42.82
ever going to war with us in terms of like what would I want from my military? I would love to never

689
01:07:42.82 --> 01:07:47.22
set foot on the battlefield. I'd love to never get now whether or not that's realistic but I would love

690
01:07:47.22 --> 01:07:52.74
a military force of people or a pornist look at and go you know what I'm good with your plan. I like

691
01:07:52.74 --> 01:07:57.22
your plan. I'm here to support that plan. You want to use our bridges and roads to for commerce

692
01:07:57.94 --> 01:08:03.54
and maybe occupy some of my towns. Yeah I let's find a compromise to make that work as opposed to no

693
01:08:03.54 --> 01:08:07.78
this isn't going to happen and your military shows up to compel me to do it in a way that I don't

694
01:08:07.78 --> 01:08:15.06
necessarily want but the object objective thing and I'm just trying to make the connection to the business

695
01:08:15.06 --> 01:08:19.38
world of if you think you're out there just to do this one thing and it doesn't support the object

696
01:08:19.38 --> 01:08:25.14
of the company or the long-term goal you're actually not successful you're not winning. I sold the

697
01:08:25.14 --> 01:08:29.62
most product cool can we support it? No can we build it? No can we back it up? No can the clients get what they

698
01:08:29.62 --> 01:08:34.34
want? No then then we actually aren't successful. What happens to our reputation? What happens to our

699
01:08:34.34 --> 01:08:41.70
backlog? We get crushed. Yeah and you're going to see he he he goes relatively hard on glosswoods

700
01:08:41.70 --> 01:08:47.62
you also explains some of the things that people missed which he kind of also blames on glosswoods

701
01:08:48.34 --> 01:08:54.58
but there's a lot of things that glosswoods says in the just aren't as memorable

702
01:08:55.62 --> 01:09:01.86
that aren't as memorable as some of his really kick ass statements and people remember what sounded

703
01:09:01.86 --> 01:09:07.94
cool. Yeah and I think how many chapters are in on war? I think he wrote like the first three

704
01:09:07.94 --> 01:09:12.58
by himself and they're really well written and super complete and then several chapters were written

705
01:09:12.58 --> 01:09:18.58
by his wife at her dad and he like half done and like and they've been you know hearts

706
01:09:18.58 --> 01:09:23.70
probably wrote this in English and glosswoods was written in some sort of Russian version that's been

707
01:09:23.70 --> 01:09:29.94
translated a thousand times so again yeah and his defense yeah and when you do that translation

708
01:09:29.94 --> 01:09:36.34
if you kind of think that maybe you know concentration and masses out of win you definitely are

709
01:09:36.34 --> 01:09:42.66
going to emphasize that I think this is what he meant and he yeah. Back to the book his theory of war

710
01:09:42.66 --> 01:09:49.14
was expounded in a way to abstract and involve for ordinary soldier minds essentially concrete

711
01:09:49.14 --> 01:09:54.82
you see the soldier minds are concrete to follow the course of his argument which often turned back

712
01:09:54.82 --> 01:10:01.14
from the direction in which it was apparently leading impressed yet buffogged they grasp at his

713
01:10:01.14 --> 01:10:07.22
vivid leading phrases seeing only their surface meaning and missing the deeper current of his thought.

714
01:10:08.42 --> 01:10:13.38
Coswitz greatest contribution to the theory of war was an emphasizing the psychological factors

715
01:10:13.38 --> 01:10:17.46
raising his voice against the geometrical school of strategy then fast-mull he showed that the

716
01:10:17.46 --> 01:10:23.06
human spirit was infinitely more important than operational lines and angles he discussed the effect

717
01:10:23.06 --> 01:10:30.26
of danger and fatigue the value of boldness and determination with deep understanding. It was his

718
01:10:30.26 --> 01:10:37.14
errors however which had the greatest effect on subsequent course of history. He was too continental

719
01:10:37.14 --> 01:10:42.98
and his outlook to understand the meaning of sea power and his vision was short on the very threshold

720
01:10:42.98 --> 01:10:50.02
of the mechanical era he declared his conviction that superiority and numbers becomes every day

721
01:10:50.02 --> 01:10:54.18
more decisive. Yeah so he kind of was a little bit late they didn't have any different content yet.

722
01:10:54.18 --> 01:11:02.66
One of the classic discussions was the what's the word I'm looking for? The relevance of

723
01:11:02.66 --> 01:11:07.38
class was in the 21st century you know start talking about you know like nuclear power

724
01:11:07.38 --> 01:11:12.42
nuclear weapon stealth airplanes and things like hey do these maximums of these do these

725
01:11:12.42 --> 01:11:17.06
do they hold up to the scrutiny of the 21st century of warfare the modern warfare and a bunch of

726
01:11:17.06 --> 01:11:22.74
discussions on that. I kind of chuckled at the idea of like his disciples the class was disciples who

727
01:11:22.74 --> 01:11:27.38
kind of aren't that smart but it really like what he had to say you know that'd be like me reading

728
01:11:27.38 --> 01:11:33.86
leadership strategy tactics and there's a chapter that says don't care and maybe like hey everybody

729
01:11:33.86 --> 01:11:40.02
don't care and but getting that wrong but the misunderstanding like I'm care as opposed to

730
01:11:40.82 --> 01:11:44.66
I don't care how we do you want to do area I don't care we'll do it your way which is a

731
01:11:44.66 --> 01:11:49.70
little bit different than don't care next thing you know Dave Burke, Jocco's disciples running

732
01:11:49.70 --> 01:11:56.18
around telling all the rest of his people we don't care and I don't care and yeah I don't care

733
01:11:56.18 --> 01:12:01.30
and we're now a bunch of people don't care and how easy you can see like disciple who's

734
01:12:02.66 --> 01:12:10.98
and I I'll never remember the quote but the the most damage is done by the concrete brave.

735
01:12:10.98 --> 01:12:15.78
Well you said the disciples that not the misunderstanding of his disciples did way more damage than the

736
01:12:15.78 --> 01:12:21.38
opponents because I'm running around espousing Jocco's you know edicts but I actually don't really

737
01:12:21.38 --> 01:12:25.14
know what he meant by don't care and I'm just using that one example of trying to be going from

738
01:12:25.14 --> 01:12:30.10
this book of like a great way of like I'm care like dude that that is not what he meant I know

739
01:12:30.10 --> 01:12:34.02
that's what it says on people but that's not what he was saying yeah or like knowing to quit

740
01:12:34.02 --> 01:12:42.34
you know what you got to tell whatever you give up shut it out yeah so he's talking about how

741
01:12:42.34 --> 01:12:46.82
important oh well I know what I was gonna say I was taking a note when you were writing I only got

742
01:12:46.82 --> 01:12:51.78
down the two letters MA and then I was looking at what that was I was gonna write I was gonna write

743
01:12:51.78 --> 01:13:00.42
machine gun because for me where the tactics sort of solidified where you can say yep these things

744
01:13:00.42 --> 01:13:05.22
hold up it's you gotta have the machine gun that's where we start to get the modern machine gun

745
01:13:05.22 --> 01:13:10.02
where we can start to kill a lot of people and how concentration is like the war the worst thing

746
01:13:10.02 --> 01:13:14.50
and just right covered move becomes totally important and it's it's important in all areas but

747
01:13:14.50 --> 01:13:20.02
it really starts to solidify around there well you use the example of like on steroids of nuclear

748
01:13:20.02 --> 01:13:24.50
weapons you know it's on my dispersion you know versus concentration with nuclear weapons

749
01:13:25.38 --> 01:13:30.42
I thought of another one just as I was thinking of this is hold the line jacos is hold the line

750
01:13:30.42 --> 01:13:36.34
like cool got it yeah we're gonna hold the line and look what we're talking about is the story

751
01:13:36.34 --> 01:13:41.78
behind the book the decademy leadership is chapter 12 in extreme ownership so cool we covered it

752
01:13:41.78 --> 01:13:45.78
why don't we have to hold right on the book of us because people still like extreme ownership

753
01:13:46.34 --> 01:13:51.62
we got all the line it's disappointed all cards like they took everything to the extreme

754
01:13:51.62 --> 01:13:56.34
and that's why the story of the patches it muster is so powerful because people are like oh this

755
01:13:56.34 --> 01:14:03.94
is gonna be awesome jacos is going to hammer that platoon and destroy them for violating his

756
01:14:03.94 --> 01:14:09.14
direct order to never wear patches that aren't professional and it's like not in care no

757
01:14:09.14 --> 01:14:14.34
factor yeah like with what it says right there hold the line yeah it's like it but actually

758
01:14:14.34 --> 01:14:19.62
living in the extremes isn't actually doesn't work usually doesn't work but the title of the

759
01:14:19.62 --> 01:14:24.58
book is a tree ownership yeah well there you go there's perfect examples this would happen to

760
01:14:24.58 --> 01:14:30.34
class but then he even get to finish his book he wrote free get three chapters and his old lady finished

761
01:14:30.34 --> 01:14:38.02
it up uh such a commandment gave reinforcement to the instinctive conservatism of soldiers in

762
01:14:38.02 --> 01:14:42.90
resisting the possibilities of a new form of superiority which mechanical invention increasingly

763
01:14:42.90 --> 01:14:49.06
offered it also gave powerful impulse to the universal extension and permanent establishment

764
01:14:49.06 --> 01:14:55.70
of the method of constricted conscription as a simple way of providing the greatest possible numbers

765
01:14:55.70 --> 01:15:00.66
so if you want a big army well if I want to be in charge of a bunch of people you know what I have

766
01:15:00.66 --> 01:15:04.26
to say look we need more people if we're gonna win cool start drafting people I want to be in

767
01:15:04.26 --> 01:15:09.54
charge more people cool draft more people this by its disregard for psychological suitability meant

768
01:15:09.54 --> 01:15:15.86
that armies became much more liable to panic and sudden collapse the earlier method however unsystematic

769
01:15:15.86 --> 01:15:20.74
had at least tended to ensure that the forces were composed of good fighting animals

770
01:15:20.74 --> 01:15:29.62
this is an interesting shot at classmates classmates contributed no new or strikingly progressive

771
01:15:29.62 --> 01:15:38.10
ideas to tactics or strategies he was a codifying thinker rather than a creative or dynamic one

772
01:15:38.10 --> 01:15:43.54
he had no such revolutionary effect on warfare as the theory of the divisional system produced in the

773
01:15:43.54 --> 01:15:49.30
18th century or the theory of armored mobility in the 20th which by the way that's what kind of

774
01:15:49.30 --> 01:15:55.22
the delheart like is about right so he said look cosers didn't do anything compared to the

775
01:15:55.22 --> 01:16:02.42
theory of armor mobility like a game of that yeah I feel bad I actually feel bad talking about

776
01:16:02.42 --> 01:16:08.66
these guys talk is that weird I didn't know how much of a hammer he was gonna be in the closet

777
01:16:08.66 --> 01:16:15.22
the cool thing is I'm hearing all this but but that mean there is a lot of I understand what he's saying

778
01:16:15.22 --> 01:16:22.82
I mean yeah yeah yeah yeah and again why didn't like we're 286 episodes deep in this and I

779
01:16:22.82 --> 01:16:29.70
haven't covered one of the most respected and well-known canons of military strategy yeah

780
01:16:29.70 --> 01:16:33.54
Claus Witz is on war why is that this is kind of why yeah

781
01:16:36.66 --> 01:16:42.58
I'm going to get some grief for this what yep going out you're getting crazy well what's interesting

782
01:16:42.58 --> 01:16:47.46
is that if I think if you were kind of just pulse a bunch of and doesn't have to be historians that are

783
01:16:47.46 --> 01:16:52.18
civilians but if you look at what the military and sort of key policy makers study

784
01:16:53.46 --> 01:16:59.38
Claus Witz is higher on that list than heart oh you know so for sure you're not even the same ballpark

785
01:16:59.38 --> 01:17:03.86
you may get some heat because if there's someone that's been studied in sort of kind of lionized

786
01:17:04.34 --> 01:17:08.82
Claus Witz is the guy yeah you know to be so yeah there's some people out there going hey well you know

787
01:17:08.82 --> 01:17:12.90
I've taken some heat over the years I had a little guy named Colonel David Aquar who was a

788
01:17:12.90 --> 01:17:18.50
complete black sheep of the army and hated by the Navy totally and I was in the Navy yeah

789
01:17:20.90 --> 01:17:28.02
talking about that guy um back to the book but in seeking to formulate the experience of the

790
01:17:28.02 --> 01:17:33.86
Napoleonic wars the emphasis he put on certain retrograde retrograde features helped to cause

791
01:17:33.86 --> 01:17:39.94
what might be termed a revolution in reverse back towards true drive-alarm fair Claus Witz theory of

792
01:17:39.94 --> 01:17:45.86
the military aim into finding the military aim Claus Witz was carried away by his passion for

793
01:17:45.86 --> 01:17:52.98
pure logic quote the and this this makes it really odd this starts to make it really obvious why

794
01:17:52.98 --> 01:18:00.34
this stuff doesn't mend with my normal way of thinking quote the aim of all action in war is to

795
01:18:00.34 --> 01:18:07.06
disarm the enemy and we shall now show that this inferior at least is indispensable if our opponent

796
01:18:07.06 --> 01:18:11.94
is to be made to comply with our will we must place him in a situation where which is more

797
01:18:11.94 --> 01:18:18.26
oppressive to him than the sacrifice we demand but the disadvantages of this position must naturally

798
01:18:18.26 --> 01:18:24.18
not be of a transitory nature at least in appearance otherwise the enemy instead of yielding will

799
01:18:24.18 --> 01:18:30.02
hold out in the hope of a change for the better every change in this position which is

800
01:18:30.02 --> 01:18:35.54
produced by a continuation of war must therefore be a change for the worse worse the worst

801
01:18:35.54 --> 01:18:40.98
condition in which a belligerent can be placed is that of being completely disarmed if therefore

802
01:18:40.98 --> 01:18:47.62
the enemy is to be reduced to an into submission he must either be positively disarmed or placed

803
01:18:47.62 --> 01:18:54.42
in such a position that he is threatened with it from this follows that the complete disarming or

804
01:18:54.42 --> 01:19:04.58
overthrow of the enemy must always be the aim of warfare and quote this reminds me of

805
01:19:05.78 --> 01:19:12.34
the bath party in Iraq being completely disarmed how much did that help my freaking hurt right

806
01:19:14.74 --> 01:19:20.18
maybe some class witsy and people were saying yep got to disarm them completely completely good job

807
01:19:20.18 --> 01:19:26.90
the influence of of can't cont where's where's Darrell Cooper of Darrell Cooper's making jokes about

808
01:19:26.90 --> 01:19:30.66
like he's just bringing in deep the echo and I are looking at him like bro wrong crowd

809
01:19:32.18 --> 01:19:38.90
the influence of cont can be perceived in class wits dualism of thought he believed in a perfect military

810
01:19:38.90 --> 01:19:45.06
world of ideals while recognizing a temporal world in which these could only be imperfectly fulfilled

811
01:19:45.06 --> 01:19:49.86
so he's giving credit here's a little credit going back to to class wits like hey man he got it

812
01:19:49.86 --> 01:19:54.34
that you got these ideals but it's the real world and it's not going to quite go that well

813
01:19:54.34 --> 01:20:00.02
for he was capable of distinguishing between what was what was militarily ideal and what he

814
01:20:00.02 --> 01:20:06.34
described as a modification in the reality thus he wrote reasoning in the abstract the mind cannot

815
01:20:06.34 --> 01:20:12.42
stop short of an extreme but everything takes a different shape when we pass from abstractions to

816
01:20:12.42 --> 01:20:19.78
reality this object of war in the abstract the disarming of the enemy is rarely attained

817
01:20:19.78 --> 01:20:25.30
in practice and is not a condition necessary to peace so he wasn't even saying what he was saying

818
01:20:25.30 --> 01:20:31.86
he goes back and kind of backs off it a little bit cost wits his tendency to the extreme is shown again

819
01:20:31.86 --> 01:20:40.02
in his discussion of battle as a means to in to the end of war he opened with the startling assertion

820
01:20:40.02 --> 01:20:48.18
there is only one single means it is the fight he justified this by a long argument to show that in

821
01:20:48.18 --> 01:20:54.10
every form of military activity quote the idea of fighting must necessarily be at the foundation

822
01:20:54.10 --> 01:21:00.02
and quote having elaborately proved what most people would be ready to accept without argument

823
01:21:00.02 --> 01:21:06.50
cause would said the object of a combat is not always the destruction of enemy forces its object

824
01:21:06.50 --> 01:21:12.90
can often be attained as well without the combat taking place at all so there you go he's saying

825
01:21:12.90 --> 01:21:21.62
some of the stuff that that I do agree with more over class which recognized that quote the

826
01:21:21.62 --> 01:21:29.30
waste of our own military forces must set a risk parabas which means all things being equal

827
01:21:29.30 --> 01:21:34.26
always be greater the moral aim is directed upon the destruction of the enemy's power

828
01:21:34.26 --> 01:21:43.54
the danger lies in this that the greater efficacy which we which we seek recoils on ourselves

829
01:21:43.54 --> 01:21:50.74
and therefore has worse consequences in case we fail of success so he's got some he's got some

830
01:21:50.74 --> 01:21:59.38
quantifying statements about his about his thoughts and theories out of his own mouth

831
01:21:59.38 --> 01:22:04.82
class with here gave a prophetic verdict upon the consequences of following his own gospel in

832
01:22:04.82 --> 01:22:10.26
World War one and two for it was the ideal and not the practical aspect of his teachings on

833
01:22:10.26 --> 01:22:17.22
battle which survived he contributed to this distortion by arguing it was only to avoid the risks of

834
01:22:17.22 --> 01:22:23.38
battle that quote any other means are taken so it's like we're trying to avoid battle that's the

835
01:22:23.38 --> 01:22:27.94
only reason that we're going to do anything else because we're trying to avoid battle and he

836
01:22:27.94 --> 01:22:32.42
fixed the distortion in the minds of his pupils by hammering on the abstract ideal.

837
01:22:34.42 --> 01:22:39.22
Here's our I guess I guess the little heart's just going to go hot on everybody he says not one

838
01:22:39.22 --> 01:22:43.54
reader and a hundred was likely to fall the subtlety of his logic or to preserve a true balance

839
01:22:43.54 --> 01:22:49.94
amidst such philosophical juggle re. But everyone could catch such a ringing phrases as and here's

840
01:22:49.94 --> 01:22:57.54
where he gets a the branded the the class with branded statements that that are a clickbait.

841
01:22:58.90 --> 01:23:06.02
Here we go and they're freaking good to go like you hear me like yeah we have only one means in war the battle.

842
01:23:07.70 --> 01:23:13.46
The bloody solution of the crisis the effort for the destruction of the enemy's forces is the first

843
01:23:13.46 --> 01:23:18.10
born son of war. I mean come on dude if you're in the military you're eating these things up like

844
01:23:18.10 --> 01:23:28.42
like a giant nice cool mulk. Only great and general battles can produce great results.

845
01:23:30.42 --> 01:23:35.70
Let us hear not of general to conquer without bloodshed right that's a that's a quote from a guy

846
01:23:35.70 --> 01:23:40.82
that earlier was saying like hey listen you don't always want to go to war yeah but who remembers

847
01:23:40.82 --> 01:23:44.34
hey sometimes you can use other means to achieve victory no one's here that they want to hear

848
01:23:44.34 --> 01:23:51.30
but it's not here of great junk generals who conquer without bloodshed. So he branded himself put

849
01:23:51.30 --> 01:23:58.58
man by the reiteration of such phrases class with blurred into the outline of his philosophy

850
01:23:58.58 --> 01:24:08.02
already indistinct and made it into mere marching refrain which in inflamed the blood and

851
01:24:08.02 --> 01:24:14.26
intoxicated the mind. In transfusion it became a doctrine fit to form corporals not generals.

852
01:24:15.14 --> 01:24:21.62
For by making battle appear quote the only real warlike activity and quote his gospel

853
01:24:21.62 --> 01:24:27.62
deprived strategy of its laurels and reduce the art of war to the mechanics of mass slaughter

854
01:24:27.62 --> 01:24:33.78
moreover it incited generals to seek battle at the first opportunity instead of creating an

855
01:24:33.78 --> 01:24:40.74
advantageous opportunity. Callsworth contributed to the subsequent decay of general ship

856
01:24:42.58 --> 01:24:49.14
when he went in an off-coated passage he wrote. Philanthropists may easily imagine that there is a

857
01:24:49.14 --> 01:24:55.46
skillful method of disarming and overcoming the enemy without great bloodshed and that is the proper

858
01:24:55.46 --> 01:25:03.54
tendency of the art of war. That is an error which must be extroplated. So like hey this idea

859
01:25:03.54 --> 01:25:09.54
of bloodshed we got to get rid of that idea that you can have war without bloodshed got to get rid of

860
01:25:09.54 --> 01:25:15.94
that idea. It is obvious that when he wrote that he did not pause to reflect that what he

861
01:25:15.94 --> 01:25:22.10
decried had been recorded as the proper aim of general ship by all masters of the art of war

862
01:25:22.10 --> 01:25:29.30
including a pulling himself like everyone sons who Napoleon everyone in between like hey man if you

863
01:25:29.30 --> 01:25:33.78
can win without fighting that's what we're doing and he's saying the opposite.

864
01:25:35.14 --> 01:25:42.18
Closworth's phrase would hence force be used by countless blunders to excuse and even justify

865
01:25:42.18 --> 01:25:50.66
their futile squandering of life in bullheaded assaults. The danger was increased because of the

866
01:25:50.66 --> 01:25:56.98
way he constantly dwelt on the decisive importance of a numerical superiority with deeper penetration

867
01:25:56.98 --> 01:26:03.46
he pointed out in one passage that surprise lies quote at the foundation of all under takings

868
01:26:03.46 --> 01:26:07.54
for without it the preponderance at the decisive point is not properly conceivable.

869
01:26:08.90 --> 01:26:13.78
So that's what we're talking about. That's cool. That's maneuver warfare. But his disciples struck

870
01:26:13.78 --> 01:26:21.54
by his more frequent emphasis on numbers came to regard mere mass as the simple recipe for victory.

871
01:26:23.14 --> 01:26:29.06
Horrible. And you know what, let's assume a little idea that is like my rank right.

872
01:26:29.06 --> 01:26:32.98
It's a rank. Hey I outrank you that's my superiority and that's what I'm going to use to lead.

873
01:26:35.38 --> 01:26:39.14
I mean that was brutal. Yeah that was kind of a brutal.

874
01:26:39.14 --> 01:26:43.14
And he died. There's some little statements that were like hey he's it. He also said this but

875
01:26:45.22 --> 01:26:51.14
it's like when the general reads it, when the soldier reads it what does he want to read?

876
01:26:51.14 --> 01:26:55.70
He wants to read about checking ass. Yeah. And what does he want his corporal

877
01:26:55.70 --> 01:26:59.86
to read? He wants his corporal to read about kicking ass. So when we start reading about kicking ass,

878
01:27:00.90 --> 01:27:03.38
we hear what we want to hear at Coach Charles. Yes sir.

879
01:27:03.38 --> 01:27:10.74
We're not done yet with Karlswitz. Crosswitz theory of the object. Even worse was the effective

880
01:27:10.74 --> 01:27:18.90
is theoretical exposition and exaltation of the idea of absolute warfare in proclaiming that the

881
01:27:18.90 --> 01:27:26.34
road to success was through the unlimited application of force. There by a doctrine which began

882
01:27:26.34 --> 01:27:30.98
by defining war only as a continuation of state policy by other means led to the contradictory

883
01:27:30.98 --> 01:27:36.90
end of making policy the slave of strategy and bad strategy at that. That's I would say that's one

884
01:27:36.90 --> 01:27:42.26
of his most famous quotes right is that wars the continuation of state policy by other means.

885
01:27:44.26 --> 01:27:49.94
But he he ends up taking things to a point where it's like wars what we're like you said.

886
01:27:49.94 --> 01:27:54.90
What the military exists for the military. Everything else exists because of the military.

887
01:27:54.90 --> 01:28:01.86
The government is here to provide the military with the resources that we need to go fight battles.

888
01:28:01.86 --> 01:28:06.74
The trend was fostered above all by his dictum that quote to introduce into philosophy of war,

889
01:28:06.74 --> 01:28:12.74
a principle of moderation would be an absurdity. War is an act of violence pushed to its utmost

890
01:28:12.74 --> 01:28:17.22
bounds. Dude, he's getting some good quotes. They're from a sound kick ass.

891
01:28:17.22 --> 01:28:28.34
Unless you're a freaking soldier and war one. Yeah. The crazy thing is I'm just kind of

892
01:28:28.34 --> 01:28:32.18
picturing this. I'm asking myself now a question that I probably should have asked five years

893
01:28:32.18 --> 01:28:37.70
ago, ten years ago when I'm thinking about this on the more academic mind of how to

894
01:28:37.70 --> 01:28:43.06
close with any of these people that are I guess disciples of that of that kind of peer logic

895
01:28:43.06 --> 01:28:49.94
trend. How do they perceive the value of their own people? Because you could see the trend of thought of like,

896
01:28:49.94 --> 01:28:55.86
hey, this is the purpose of the military is the utter destruction or what those quotes

897
01:28:56.90 --> 01:29:02.26
where is that the you could make a very easy link of like, hey, my soldiers, they're just

898
01:29:02.26 --> 01:29:06.82
implements and tools. They're just resources to be expanded to achieve that end state.

899
01:29:06.82 --> 01:29:11.54
And how quickly you could make the stretch like in war war one, you could almost imagine like,

900
01:29:11.54 --> 01:29:16.10
yeah, they're not, they're not people, they're resources. They just give me 10,000 more resources

901
01:29:16.10 --> 01:29:21.62
or more tools to accomplish this thing. Yeah. I mean, you kind of phrase that as a question.

902
01:29:21.62 --> 01:29:24.90
I don't think there's much of a question. I'm sure I think it's pretty obvious where

903
01:29:24.90 --> 01:29:30.02
where these guys were coming from. And it's it's really scary that you had a culture that

904
01:29:30.02 --> 01:29:41.46
supported that and you had, you know, you know, it's like it's it's really strange. You think about

905
01:29:41.46 --> 01:29:50.66
like kippling and and kippling who wrote these very patriotic poems that fueled this culture

906
01:29:50.66 --> 01:30:00.42
inside of England. And his son was killed in in World War One and like the last thing they saw

907
01:30:00.42 --> 01:30:05.22
of him was he's blinded and he's kind of like stumbling on the battlefield before he was killed

908
01:30:05.22 --> 01:30:09.30
in his body. I don't think they ever even recovered his body. He's just lost in the mud and muck.

909
01:30:10.10 --> 01:30:17.86
And he's got a really harrowing poem. I think I know the phrase of the poem is,

910
01:30:17.86 --> 01:30:24.34
is my boy Jack or my son Jack. It's it's it's harrowing to read and if you know what the

911
01:30:24.34 --> 01:30:33.14
fuck he's talking about, which is that he, you know, he was this patriotic guy who supported

912
01:30:33.14 --> 01:30:45.46
England and was contributing to that propaganda. This Victorian, this this this culture of

913
01:30:45.46 --> 01:30:52.50
look look look you go over the top it's time to go you go and and he lost his son and you wonder what kind of

914
01:30:56.10 --> 01:31:01.38
you know how that just the impact that that had on him and and there is an impact when you read

915
01:31:01.38 --> 01:31:06.18
his poems and you see before and after you see what happened you can see that it definitely had an

916
01:31:06.18 --> 01:31:16.58
impact but the man the idea that tens and thousands and hundreds of thousands of people like

917
01:31:16.58 --> 01:31:21.70
you said like we're like okay cool that's what we're doing that's what we're doing we're going to go

918
01:31:21.70 --> 01:31:27.70
over there and when they say go over the top we're going to go over the top the Germans the French

919
01:31:27.70 --> 01:31:37.14
the Canadians the Americans the I mean that's what we're doing it's very very hard you know you

920
01:31:37.14 --> 01:31:41.78
talk about the value of life and your question around like what do they think of these people

921
01:31:41.78 --> 01:31:50.18
it's like yeah what did they and how did we get to a point where modern civilization

922
01:31:50.18 --> 01:31:58.98
both is a hundred years ago yes a hundred years ago hundred years ago this was happening it's

923
01:31:58.98 --> 01:32:08.02
like it's crazy to think about and and you can kind of see I mean what's there's another good

924
01:32:08.02 --> 01:32:17.86
saying it's something along the lines of like old men like to send young men to fight

925
01:32:17.86 --> 01:32:22.18
young men like to go fight like that's kind of a thing right and you can see how those

926
01:32:23.30 --> 01:32:28.98
sort of animalistic instincts that we have and tribal instincts that we have are

927
01:32:30.10 --> 01:32:36.66
and and heroic instincts that we have are captured and capitalized on and

928
01:32:37.62 --> 01:32:42.98
by like a consequence like when you read calls which are like cool I'm down with heroic efforts

929
01:32:42.98 --> 01:32:51.14
I'm down with tribal behavior I'm down with being brave like all those things just roll right

930
01:32:51.14 --> 01:32:55.38
into this so if you don't want to be that guy that's sort of like well

931
01:32:57.70 --> 01:33:04.42
maybe we should think about these soldiers as human beings who's doing that no apparently no one

932
01:33:04.42 --> 01:33:12.74
apparently no one so what you have I guess what I'm saying is you have a human instinct

933
01:33:12.74 --> 01:33:19.38
an a human slash animal instinct to be tribal to be heroic to be sacrificial to make sacrifices

934
01:33:19.38 --> 01:33:25.14
for the tribe I mean what is a hero you know I've talked about this before a hero is someone

935
01:33:25.14 --> 01:33:30.26
that's not doing that not making a sacrifice for himself right of the hero is someone that's

936
01:33:30.26 --> 01:33:35.46
making a sacrifice for someone else and that's a common that's just the definition of a hero

937
01:33:35.46 --> 01:33:44.10
in any language so when you say hey we've got kind of a program here that allows us to be heroic

938
01:33:44.10 --> 01:33:51.54
on a massive scale this is what you end up with and we kind of lean towards and we tend towards

939
01:33:51.54 --> 01:33:58.50
and you can see how you can see how the contrary is that you have BH La Del Hart who's saying

940
01:33:58.50 --> 01:34:06.26
hey not smart not smart it's better to maneuver it's better to leave it's better to retreat

941
01:34:06.26 --> 01:34:10.42
it's better to attack on a different day and and how is he getting branded it's getting branded like

942
01:34:10.42 --> 01:34:15.22
what that will you talk about will you a coward yeah is that what's going on your coward he's like

943
01:34:15.22 --> 01:34:21.22
hey bro I win wounded three times and gasped almost the death you fucking savages and you don't know

944
01:34:21.22 --> 01:34:31.22
what that was like you talk about how many times this has come up this the capacity for the

945
01:34:31.22 --> 01:34:37.14
dehumanization of our enemies and how there's a danger in there and there's there's a natural

946
01:34:37.14 --> 01:34:46.42
piece of that but you gotta keep it to a certain place but I think for me just to reconcile the dehumanization

947
01:34:46.42 --> 01:34:53.14
of your own men I understand the dehumanization of the enemy I understand that and I also understand

948
01:34:53.14 --> 01:34:58.18
that there's a limit to that too and if you go too far you can undermine your own objectives we know

949
01:34:58.18 --> 01:35:05.46
that we know that but the ability to do that with your own men your your own people is it's it

950
01:35:06.58 --> 01:35:15.54
I think that's just why cilir ones are just sitting its own category of just so hard to come to grips

951
01:35:15.54 --> 01:35:25.70
with with us doing that it does it's easy it's own categories for us on concern yeah

952
01:35:28.10 --> 01:35:37.06
right and I guess that's where we end up with these two kind of opposing theories of war

953
01:35:37.06 --> 01:35:46.26
and who wants to be called the wimp who wants to be called the weak right because that's

954
01:35:46.26 --> 01:35:50.26
what you could easily go back to be actually a heart and say like well he wants to run away

955
01:35:50.26 --> 01:35:54.90
he wants to you know attack people from the rear there's a time where attacking someone the rear

956
01:35:54.90 --> 01:35:58.50
shoot him in the back was like a horrible thing right it's a kind of cowardice yeah it's a kind of

957
01:35:58.50 --> 01:36:03.94
cowardice to go around and you know not line up like the other team shoot him in the back yeah

958
01:36:03.94 --> 01:36:11.38
you know I've been the coolest part about being on the podcast and this seat is this is I hear this

959
01:36:11.38 --> 01:36:15.62
live as you're reading I don't I don't get the advanced copy you don't like say Dave we're

960
01:36:15.62 --> 01:36:21.14
prepping this I get to hear this and I I'm thinking and I'm trying to analyzing I'm making

961
01:36:21.14 --> 01:36:25.30
connections and correlations and and I've kind of just been chuckling a little bit of like hard

962
01:36:25.30 --> 01:36:34.02
is just hammering clouds wits but he it's almost like I understand more now of why he's so brutal

963
01:36:34.02 --> 01:36:40.74
on the attack of him when he made that connection of he's the reason why we had generals and I think

964
01:36:40.74 --> 01:36:45.54
he used the word blunders which is about as nice as you can describe what those leaders did in order

965
01:36:45.54 --> 01:36:54.74
one is I actually think I understand why he's so brutal on him is because of what it led to and

966
01:36:54.74 --> 01:37:01.30
I think he's doing a good job saying I know class was as goal was not to create this circumstance

967
01:37:01.30 --> 01:37:06.82
and he's defending components of that but his point was this is the outcome that he created this

968
01:37:06.82 --> 01:37:13.94
his words and his philosophy is what facilitated this this window of warfare and our time

969
01:37:13.94 --> 01:37:20.98
that allowed us to dehumanize our own men on a scale that's really hard to really comprehend

970
01:37:21.62 --> 01:37:26.42
and and I think I'm understanding in real time why he's saying what he's saying about him

971
01:37:26.42 --> 01:37:32.42
it's such a brutal fashion and I understand it yeah and I kicked off this whole podcast with the

972
01:37:32.42 --> 01:37:38.82
last podcast by explaining what he'd been through and I said this shit left a mark on him

973
01:37:38.82 --> 01:37:46.18
I mean look it leaves a mark on you when you lose one guy in combat one guy in combat it's

974
01:37:46.18 --> 01:37:49.70
gonna leave him you're never gonna forget it you're never gonna live it down you're never gonna

975
01:37:49.70 --> 01:37:54.90
go a day without thinking about it can you imagine when you're battalion gets wiped out

976
01:37:55.78 --> 01:38:02.02
can you imagine when you're brigade when you're division when you take 60,000 casualties in a day

977
01:38:02.02 --> 01:38:10.34
that's what's going on and and the quote that you're reaching back for was

978
01:38:10.34 --> 01:38:17.62
clouds with phrase would hence force be used by countless blunders to excuse and even justify

979
01:38:18.82 --> 01:38:24.98
their feudal squandering of life in bullhead and assaults yeah he's talking about exactly

980
01:38:24.98 --> 01:38:34.18
what he lived through and that shit left a mark on him without question yeah and this is his

981
01:38:34.18 --> 01:38:40.98
opportunity to tell a generation of leaders contemplating the impact of that guy's words

982
01:38:41.70 --> 01:38:47.06
with the reality of without some logical thinking about what he really is trying to say

983
01:38:47.70 --> 01:38:52.26
this is the path you will go down and this is his way of saying you cannot go down that path

984
01:38:52.26 --> 01:38:56.18
yeah you want to go and read the rooftops of this guy and turn it into how you're gonna fight

985
01:38:56.18 --> 01:39:01.86
a war you're an idiot you're an idiot

986
01:39:05.14 --> 01:39:09.78
wars in act of violence pushed to its utmost bounds that's the last quote I give he says

987
01:39:09.78 --> 01:39:16.02
that declaration is served as a foundation for the extravagant absurdity of modern total warfare

988
01:39:16.02 --> 01:39:23.38
his principle of force without limit and without calculation of costs fits and is fit only

989
01:39:23.38 --> 01:39:30.58
for a hate maddened mob so he's not done yet it is the negation of statemanship and

990
01:39:30.58 --> 01:39:38.66
intelligent strategy which seeks to serve the ends of policy if war be a continuation of policy

991
01:39:38.66 --> 01:39:44.90
as clouds with its head elsewhere declared it it must necessarily be conducted with a view

992
01:39:44.90 --> 01:39:51.54
to post war benefit a state which expands its strength to the point of exhaustion bank rubs its own

993
01:39:51.54 --> 01:39:54.58
policy and by the way that's at all players in world war one

994
01:39:55.62 --> 01:40:01.78
cost with himself had qualified the principle of quote utmost force by the admission that quote

995
01:40:01.78 --> 01:40:07.70
the political object as the original motive of war should be the standard for determining

996
01:40:07.70 --> 01:40:19.86
both the aim of the military force and also the amount of effort to be made still more significant

997
01:40:19.86 --> 01:40:25.62
was a reflective passage in which he remarked that to pursue the logical extreme and tailed that

998
01:40:25.62 --> 01:40:32.42
quote the means would lose all relation to the end and in most cases the aim at an extreme effort

999
01:40:32.42 --> 01:40:39.14
would be wrecked by the opposite weight of forces within itself what's the what's the return

1000
01:40:39.14 --> 01:40:46.18
on investment you're going to get his classic work on war was the product of 12 years of intensive

1001
01:40:46.18 --> 01:40:50.82
thought if it's author had lived to spend a longer time in thinking about war he might have

1002
01:40:50.82 --> 01:40:57.78
reached a wiser and clearer conclusion as his thinking progressed he was being led toward a

1003
01:40:57.78 --> 01:41:02.42
different view penetrating deeper unhappily the process was cut short by his death from

1004
01:41:02.42 --> 01:41:08.10
cholera in 1830 it was only after his death that his writings on war were published by his widow

1005
01:41:08.10 --> 01:41:13.70
they were found in a number of sealed packets bearing the significant and prophetic note so he wrote

1006
01:41:13.70 --> 01:41:20.98
a note on his writings and it said should the work be interrupted by my death then what is found

1007
01:41:20.98 --> 01:41:28.90
can only be called a massive conceptions not brought into form open to endless misconceptions

1008
01:41:31.94 --> 01:41:35.54
sorry class what's I mean he covered it he did his best to cover it

1009
01:41:37.54 --> 01:41:42.26
much of the harm might have been avoided but for that fatal cholera germ for there are significant

1010
01:41:42.26 --> 01:41:46.82
indications that in the gradual evolution of his thought he had reached a point where he was about to drop

1011
01:41:46.82 --> 01:41:53.22
his original concept of absolute war and revise his whole theory on more common sense lines

1012
01:41:53.22 --> 01:41:58.90
when death intervened in consequence the way was left open to endless misconceptions far

1013
01:41:58.90 --> 01:42:04.90
excessive his anticipation for the universal adoption of the theory of unlimited war has gone

1014
01:42:05.70 --> 01:42:12.58
far to wreck civilization the teaching of classmates taken without understanding largely influenced

1015
01:42:12.58 --> 01:42:19.38
both the causation and the character of world war one thereby it led on all two logically

1016
01:42:19.38 --> 01:42:22.98
to world war two

1017
01:42:28.18 --> 01:42:32.50
theory and flux next section after world war one the course and effects of the first world war

1018
01:42:32.50 --> 01:42:37.62
provided ample cause to doubt the validity of cross with theory at least interpreted by his

1019
01:42:37.62 --> 01:42:42.90
successors on land and numerical battles will fought without ever producing the decisive result

1020
01:42:42.90 --> 01:42:49.38
expected of them but the responsible leaders were slow to adapt their aim to circumstances

1021
01:42:49.38 --> 01:42:55.78
or develop new means to make the aim more possible and maybe that's why when he was going through

1022
01:42:55.78 --> 01:43:02.82
the eight um items that we were talking about earlier on the earlier podcast his number one

1023
01:43:02.82 --> 01:43:08.02
thing remember you're saying the number one thing was his number eight thing his number one thing was

1024
01:43:08.90 --> 01:43:13.38
adjust your adjust your end to your means and here he's saying the responsible leaders were slow

1025
01:43:13.38 --> 01:43:18.58
to adapt their aim to the circumstances or develop new means to make the aim more possible

1026
01:43:19.22 --> 01:43:25.06
instead of facing the problem they pressed theory to a suicide-licks stream draining their own

1027
01:43:25.06 --> 01:43:30.58
strength beyond the safety limit in pursuit of an ideal of complete victory by battle which was

1028
01:43:30.58 --> 01:43:37.46
never fulfilled that one side ultimately collapsed that one side ultimately collapsed so the

1029
01:43:37.46 --> 01:43:43.06
Germans ultimately collapsed do more to emptiness of stomach produced by economic pressure of

1030
01:43:43.06 --> 01:43:48.50
sea power than the loss of blood although blood which was lost in the abortive German offensive

1031
01:43:48.50 --> 01:43:53.38
of 1918 and the loss of spirit in consequence of their palpable failure to gain the victory

1032
01:43:53.38 --> 01:44:01.22
hasten the collapse if this provided the opposition the opposing nations with the semblance of victory

1033
01:44:01.22 --> 01:44:08.18
their efforts to win it cost them such a price in moral and physical exhaustion that they the

1034
01:44:08.18 --> 01:44:12.42
seeming victors will left incapable of consolidating their position.

1035
01:44:14.82 --> 01:44:19.30
It became evident there was something wrong with the theory or at least with its application

1036
01:44:19.30 --> 01:44:27.30
alike on the planes of the tactic strategy in policy the appalling losses suffered in vain

1037
01:44:27.30 --> 01:44:32.98
pursuit of the ideal objective and the post-war exhaustion of the nominal victors showed that a

1038
01:44:32.98 --> 01:44:38.66
thorough re-examination of the whole problem of the object and aim was needed.

1039
01:44:41.54 --> 01:44:47.22
Besides these negative factors that were also several positive reasons to prompt a fresh inquiry

1040
01:44:47.22 --> 01:44:53.30
one was the decisive part that C powered played without any decisive battle at C and producing

1041
01:44:53.30 --> 01:44:58.58
the enemies collapsed by economic pressure that raised the question whether Britain in particular

1042
01:44:58.58 --> 01:45:02.98
had not made a basic mistake in departing from her traditional strategy and devoting much of her

1043
01:45:02.98 --> 01:45:07.94
effort at such terrific cost to herself to the prolonged attempt to win a decisive victory on land.

1044
01:45:07.94 --> 01:45:13.46
Yeah England Freak and Survived Forever just by rolling the sea.

1045
01:45:13.46 --> 01:45:18.98
Pretend you're rules the waves that's what we do in England now we're over here fighting these

1046
01:45:18.98 --> 01:45:20.02
these people on land.

1047
01:45:23.78 --> 01:45:25.94
Two other reasons arose from the new factors.

1048
01:45:27.38 --> 01:45:31.38
The development of air forces offered the possibility of striking a count.

1049
01:45:31.38 --> 01:45:36.18
The enemies economic and moral centers without having to first achieve the destruction of the

1050
01:45:36.18 --> 01:45:42.34
enemies main forces on the battlefield air power might attain a direct end by indirect means

1051
01:45:42.34 --> 01:45:45.06
hopping over opposition instead of overthrowing it.

1052
01:45:46.42 --> 01:45:47.14
Good deal Dave.

1053
01:45:48.74 --> 01:45:52.18
I mean that's always been the goal whether it's whether it's ever an approved to be true.

1054
01:45:53.94 --> 01:45:57.30
You could make a couple arguments but if that's always been the goal we can do this for that

1055
01:45:57.30 --> 01:45:59.78
actually fighting on the ground on the ground.

1056
01:46:02.34 --> 01:46:05.94
At the same time so at the same time we have air power at the same time the combined development

1057
01:46:05.94 --> 01:46:10.82
of the petrol motor and the caterpillar track opened up a prospect of developing mechanized land

1058
01:46:10.82 --> 01:46:15.30
forces of high mobility this in turn foreshadowed a newly enlarged possibility of producing

1059
01:46:15.30 --> 01:46:19.62
the collapse of the enemy's main forces without a serious battle by cutting their supply lines

1060
01:46:19.62 --> 01:46:24.58
dislocating their control systems or producing paralysis by the sheer nerve shock of deep

1061
01:46:24.58 --> 01:46:25.38
penetration of the river.

1062
01:46:25.38 --> 01:46:30.34
So you all have seen you got vehicles that can haul ass, knock it shot up and move a bunch of

1063
01:46:30.34 --> 01:46:31.54
troops in a short amount of time.

1064
01:46:32.42 --> 01:46:36.74
Mechanized land forces of this new kind might also provide like air power,

1065
01:46:36.74 --> 01:46:42.02
though in a lesser degree the possibility of striking direct at the heart and nerve system of

1066
01:46:42.02 --> 01:46:42.90
the opposing country.

1067
01:46:44.74 --> 01:46:49.62
While air mobility could achieve such direct strokes by an overhead form of indirect approach

1068
01:46:49.62 --> 01:46:54.90
tank mobility might achieve them by indirect approach on the ground avoiding the obstacle of the

1069
01:46:54.90 --> 01:46:55.62
opposing army.

1070
01:46:57.62 --> 01:47:02.42
To illustrate the point by a board game analogy with chess air mobility introduced the night's

1071
01:47:02.42 --> 01:47:06.10
move and tank mobility a queen's move into warfare.

1072
01:47:06.10 --> 01:47:10.02
Analogied is not of course expressed that respective values for an air force combined with the

1073
01:47:10.02 --> 01:47:14.34
vaulting power of the night's move with the always flexibility of the queen's move.

1074
01:47:16.10 --> 01:47:19.14
On the other hand a mechanized force a mechanized ground force,

1075
01:47:19.14 --> 01:47:33.70
though at lacked vaulting power could remain an occupation of the square it gained.

1076
01:47:32.66 --> 01:47:33.70
A couple other things.

1077
01:47:36.58 --> 01:47:44.66
These new technologies increase the range of military action against military objectives,

1078
01:47:44.66 --> 01:47:50.90
making it easier to overthrow and opposing body such as an army by paralyzing some of its vital

1079
01:47:50.90 --> 01:47:55.62
organs instead of having to destroy it physically as a whole by hard fighting.

1080
01:47:55.62 --> 01:47:59.62
So if you could knock out some of the key nodes that's going to be better.

1081
01:48:01.30 --> 01:48:06.18
The sum effect of the advent of this multiplied mobility both on the ground and in the air

1082
01:48:06.18 --> 01:48:09.86
was to increase the power and importance of strategy relative to tactics.

1083
01:48:09.86 --> 01:48:16.18
The higher commanders of the future would have the prospect of achieving decisive results

1084
01:48:16.18 --> 01:48:21.22
much more by movement than by fighting compared with their predecessors.

1085
01:48:25.30 --> 01:48:29.22
Unfortunately, those skipping ahead a little bit of unfortunately those who were at the head of the

1086
01:48:29.22 --> 01:48:35.22
armies after World War I were slow to recognize the need of a fresh definition of the military aim

1087
01:48:35.22 --> 01:48:39.14
in light of changed conditions and war instruments.

1088
01:48:41.70 --> 01:48:44.82
I mean you should be absolutely rethinking every.

1089
01:48:44.82 --> 01:48:48.34
You imagine going from not having tanks and aircraft to having tanks and aircraft,

1090
01:48:48.34 --> 01:48:53.06
you should be completely changing the entire way you're thinking about warfare.

1091
01:48:56.26 --> 01:48:59.38
And by the way this is after World War I.

1092
01:48:59.38 --> 01:49:06.42
I knew we did a piece, we did a podcast on the Boer War and they learned all these lessons

1093
01:49:06.42 --> 01:49:09.30
during the Boer War and they freaking didn't capitalize on any of them.

1094
01:49:09.86 --> 01:49:14.10
Like World War I shouldn't have happened but just based on what they learned in the

1095
01:49:14.10 --> 01:49:17.30
Boer War I'm going extreme I don't want to go this extreme.

1096
01:49:17.30 --> 01:49:20.58
There are many lessons that they weren't learned during the Boer War

1097
01:49:21.62 --> 01:49:23.94
that they could have taken back and said we need to do things differently.

1098
01:49:24.82 --> 01:49:27.54
And they didn't freaking adjust very many of them at all.

1099
01:49:27.54 --> 01:49:32.98
We're going back to the last podcast and one of the first comments he made about

1100
01:49:33.86 --> 01:49:40.90
the natural resistance, the automatic resistance that will happen when you propose change.

1101
01:49:40.90 --> 01:49:43.62
And I'm paraphrasing, I'm already exact quote, but the idea that when I

1102
01:49:44.42 --> 01:49:48.10
suggest a change to the norm, there will be resistance.

1103
01:49:50.34 --> 01:49:53.78
To call me even a history and an amateur is a compliment.

1104
01:49:53.78 --> 01:50:00.18
But I even think about the advent of air power and the resistance even in the navy to the idea

1105
01:50:00.18 --> 01:50:04.82
that air power would somehow supplant the battleship as the preeminent force.

1106
01:50:08.98 --> 01:50:13.94
And how obvious it seems now certainly, but at the time we're thinking, hey,

1107
01:50:14.66 --> 01:50:21.70
do you not see the potential advantage if we could somehow occupy this third dimension of battle

1108
01:50:21.70 --> 01:50:27.46
exclusively and how much risk it creates and the resistance.

1109
01:50:27.46 --> 01:50:33.94
And my guess would be is that for the few folks that had the audacity to vocalize those lessons.

1110
01:50:35.70 --> 01:50:40.50
Run out of the navy and by the way remember last podcast when I talked about 17 out of 20

1111
01:50:40.50 --> 01:50:47.14
advancements in naval warfare, one of them was air craft carriers and air power totally.

1112
01:50:47.14 --> 01:50:50.10
That's one of the more people here. You can't get him yet. We have a battleship, bro.

1113
01:50:50.10 --> 01:50:52.58
Right. Back off. Yeah.

1114
01:50:54.98 --> 01:51:02.34
It's this book is getting harder and harder to listen to because because because I have the

1115
01:51:02.34 --> 01:51:08.10
the the his the hindsight of his of of what he's saying and the context of that which he

1116
01:51:08.10 --> 01:51:12.58
he didn't have the future context that we all have now, but it's making it just so much more

1117
01:51:12.58 --> 01:51:20.10
damning to you know what he's saying fast forward a little bit practice in World War II.

1118
01:51:21.62 --> 01:51:28.18
When the next war came the handful of new land forces of mechanized kind that had been created,

1119
01:51:28.18 --> 01:51:34.02
amply fulfilled the claims that had been made for them and for their decisive effect if employed

1120
01:51:34.02 --> 01:51:41.22
for long-range strokes at strategic objectives. Unfortunately, it's the Nazis that they're just going

1121
01:51:41.22 --> 01:51:45.38
to say yeah. A mere six divisions of this kind were largely instrumental in producing the

1122
01:51:45.38 --> 01:51:53.22
collapse of Poland in a few weeks. A mere 10 such divisions virtually decided the so-called

1123
01:51:53.22 --> 01:51:58.82
Battle of France before the infantry mass of the German army had even come in action and made

1124
01:51:58.82 --> 01:52:04.42
the collapse of all Western countries and almost inevitable sequel. This conquest of the West

1125
01:52:04.42 --> 01:52:10.02
was completed in barely a month's campaign with amazingly small cost to the victor. Indeed,

1126
01:52:10.02 --> 01:52:16.66
the bloodshed all around was very slight and then the decisive phase trifling by a

1127
01:52:16.66 --> 01:52:24.90
class witsy and standard. I mean, can you imagine you fight those freaking three bloody

1128
01:52:24.90 --> 01:52:35.62
satanic battles? I mean campaigns in World War I. Just incomprehensible and then fast forward

1129
01:52:35.62 --> 01:52:42.34
how many years 20 years 20 years 22 years whatever and it's over and less than a month.

1130
01:52:42.34 --> 01:52:45.94
Like that's what we're talking about and there's almost no bloodshed because it just happened so

1131
01:52:45.94 --> 01:52:51.78
fast because we have maneuver on our side. Yeah, even between those two examples not not to

1132
01:52:51.78 --> 01:52:58.82
marginalize what the Germans did to Poland but it's what happened to the French that seems

1133
01:52:58.82 --> 01:53:09.86
to me more remarkable because of what they had just been through and then to see the image of

1134
01:53:09.86 --> 01:53:18.98
Hitler at the Eiffel Tower. I mean, that's a it's hard to put in a words what that means

1135
01:53:18.98 --> 01:53:31.62
for him to be standing with with with basically no real cost of doing it relative. Crazy, crazy.

1136
01:53:31.62 --> 01:53:35.38
While this sweeping victory was attained by action against objectives of military nature,

1137
01:53:35.38 --> 01:53:40.66
it was mainly through action of maneuver strategic more than tackle. So it's a different,

1138
01:53:40.66 --> 01:53:51.86
he's playing a different game. Similar reflections apply to the even swift or conquest of the

1139
01:53:51.86 --> 01:53:56.66
Balkans in April of 1941, which once again demonstrated the paralyzing effect of the new

1140
01:53:56.66 --> 01:54:01.94
instruments of strategic application battle was insignificant in comparison and destruction

1141
01:54:01.94 --> 01:54:06.34
palpably inappropriate term for the way that the decision was achieved. When it came to the

1142
01:54:06.34 --> 01:54:11.78
invasion of Russia, a somewhat different method was tried. Many of the German generals, particularly

1143
01:54:11.78 --> 01:54:17.22
holder, the chief of the general staff, complain of Hitler's tendency to aim at the economic

1144
01:54:17.22 --> 01:54:22.82
rather than military objectives. But analysis of the operational orders and of their own evidence

1145
01:54:22.82 --> 01:54:27.38
does not bear out the charge while Hitler was inclined to think that the economic aim would be

1146
01:54:27.38 --> 01:54:32.50
more effective. It is clear that in the crucial period of 1941 campaign, he conformed to the

1147
01:54:32.50 --> 01:54:40.82
general staff's preference for fighting battles. Thankfully, the pursuit of the same did not prove

1148
01:54:40.82 --> 01:54:46.18
decisive, although it produced several great victories in which immense forces of the enemy were

1149
01:54:46.18 --> 01:54:52.90
destroyed. Okay, went and killed a bunch of Russians. Whether concentration on economic objectives

1150
01:54:52.90 --> 01:54:56.74
would have been more decisive remains an open question, but the reflection that some of the

1151
01:54:56.74 --> 01:55:01.94
ableist of the German generals consider that the best chance of defeating Soviet Russia was lost

1152
01:55:01.94 --> 01:55:06.50
by aiming to win battles in the classical way, instead of driving through as fast as possible,

1153
01:55:07.14 --> 01:55:14.18
to the moral, economic objectives offered by Maskot, Maskot and Leningrad, the leading exponent,

1154
01:55:14.18 --> 01:55:18.66
our guardian, the leading exponent of the new school of mechanical mobile warfare, wish to do

1155
01:55:19.06 --> 01:55:22.58
on this key question Hitler had sided with the Orthodox school.

1156
01:55:22.58 --> 01:55:34.66
I like like like we said thank God. In the series of swift German conquest, the Air Force

1157
01:55:34.66 --> 01:55:38.66
combined with the mechanized elements of land forces in producing the paralysis and moral

1158
01:55:38.66 --> 01:55:44.98
disintegration of the opposing forces and of nations behind. Its effect was terrific and must be

1159
01:55:44.98 --> 01:55:50.34
reckoned fully as important as that of the Panzer Forces. The two are inseparable in any

1160
01:55:50.34 --> 01:55:55.22
valuation of the elements that created the new style of lightning warfare, LeBlitz Kreg.

1161
01:55:57.62 --> 01:56:02.50
So I'm going to fast forward a little bit. There's a section in here about

1162
01:56:04.26 --> 01:56:11.86
strategic bombing and what he calls grand strategic bombing or industrial bombing and he kind of goes into

1163
01:56:11.86 --> 01:56:20.74
into how effective it actually was. He says the actual effect which this kind of bombing

1164
01:56:20.74 --> 01:56:24.58
achieved in contribution to victory is very difficult to assess despite much detailed

1165
01:56:24.58 --> 01:56:30.74
investigation. The estimation of the data is confused by partisan estimate assessments, both by

1166
01:56:30.74 --> 01:56:36.74
those who favored industrial bombing and those who opposed it on various grounds, apart from the

1167
01:56:36.74 --> 01:56:45.62
fog thus created a correct assessment is handicapped and made almost impossible by the amount of

1168
01:56:45.62 --> 01:56:54.26
imponderbelia in the data even more than the evidence about any other type of military action

1169
01:56:54.26 --> 01:57:03.14
imponderbelia meaning things that can't be determined. So he's basically saying that some of the

1170
01:57:03.14 --> 01:57:11.06
industrial bombing may have not had been effective as we thought it was. Fast forward a little bit

1171
01:57:11.06 --> 01:57:16.26
still clear is the extremely detrimental effective industrial bombing on the post war situation.

1172
01:57:16.26 --> 01:57:19.22
Again, we're going to think grand strategy. We've got to think about what's happening afterwards.

1173
01:57:19.22 --> 01:57:24.02
Beyond the immense scale of devastation, hard to repair are the less obvious, but probably

1174
01:57:24.02 --> 01:57:29.46
more lasting social and moral effects. This kind of action inevitably produces a deepening

1175
01:57:29.46 --> 01:57:35.94
danger to the relative shallow foundations of civilized life. Think about what you're doing to this

1176
01:57:35.94 --> 01:57:42.26
civilian populace and how is that going to affect the future? That common danger is now immensely

1177
01:57:42.26 --> 01:57:48.50
increased by the advent of the atomic bomb. Here we are brought to the fundamental difference between

1178
01:57:48.50 --> 01:57:55.30
strategy and grand strategy. Whereas strategy is only concerned with the problem of winning military

1179
01:57:55.30 --> 01:58:03.54
victory, grand strategy must take a longer view. For its problem is the winning of the peace.

1180
01:58:04.74 --> 01:58:11.46
Such an order of thought is not a matter of putting the cart before the horse,

1181
01:58:13.30 --> 01:58:17.30
but of being clear where the horse and cart are going.

1182
01:58:17.30 --> 01:58:24.82
I'll tell you what, with that we're approaching two hours right now, we're probably really close

1183
01:58:24.82 --> 01:58:33.86
if not at two hours and we have a lot more to cover. Echo is a cool we wrap this one up for now.

1184
01:58:33.86 --> 01:58:42.10
Sure. All right, so we'll come back to you one more podcast about this book and well,

1185
01:58:42.10 --> 01:58:49.62
I've got about these books until then until then and look, we're going deeper right now.

1186
01:58:49.62 --> 01:58:57.06
We're drinking some drinks. We're getting after it. How do we get these drinks? We're drinking.

1187
01:58:57.06 --> 01:59:02.02
What are we doing? You just cracked another one open. Sure. Where we got. I actually real quick

1188
01:59:02.02 --> 01:59:06.90
I had to thought that it's so clouds to it and let them harden. They're kind of like,

1189
01:59:06.90 --> 01:59:14.58
you're watching karate kid. Yes. The OG original karate kid John Kriss. Mr. Mayaghi. Okay. So

1190
01:59:15.22 --> 01:59:21.30
class widths. Class widths are class widths. Depends on what kind of an accent. I'm kind of like a

1191
01:59:21.30 --> 01:59:28.10
tempting bunch of. So he's John Kriss. Strike first strike hard, no mercy. Like kind of that

1192
01:59:28.10 --> 01:59:33.70
philosophy. That's Mr. Miyagi. No, that's John Kriss. You know kind of the bad guy, but he'll

1193
01:59:33.70 --> 01:59:38.26
get you fired up. You'll get you fired up. Right. We kind of. Let's face it. We all want to say no mercy

1194
01:59:38.26 --> 01:59:45.14
in this dojo. Yeah. Kind of like that. Fear does not exist in this dojo. Check. All this stuff.

1195
01:59:45.14 --> 01:59:50.26
So he gets you fired up, you know, but Mr. Miyagi for 40 seconds by the way. Oh, really? He's

1196
01:59:50.26 --> 01:59:58.18
in for real life. No. In the story. Yeah. I got a book about the 440 second. I got to get a

1197
01:59:58.18 --> 02:00:02.58
better one. I got one of it as a history book and it was cool and somebody sent it to me and I was

1198
02:00:02.58 --> 02:00:07.14
kind of stoked like yeah, but it was a history book. Wasn't a lot of first person. I was like cool.

1199
02:00:07.14 --> 02:00:09.94
We can do history book as long as a bunch of first person counts. It really wasn't that many

1200
02:00:09.94 --> 02:00:16.58
and then I got to get I got to get on the 440 second. Hmm. I did it. Unless Mr. Miyagi his whole thing was

1201
02:00:17.30 --> 02:00:22.82
balance right takes Daniel son out on the river or in the lake and he has him on the boat. Right

1202
02:00:22.82 --> 02:00:27.54
balance first before he's like, when do I learn out of fight all this stuff? What else did he say?

1203
02:00:27.54 --> 02:00:34.10
Why learn karate and he was like, so you don't have to fight put every little thing. The balance

1204
02:00:34.10 --> 02:00:38.82
man. It's what it seemed like to me. I don't know. There you go. Provided some more. Look,

1205
02:00:38.82 --> 02:00:42.58
if you're right in reading these books and you're just getting it from a karate kid. You could have

1206
02:00:42.58 --> 02:00:48.02
figured out a lot of it. Yeah, that's true. Unless you are right. We are here drinking discipline go.

1207
02:00:48.98 --> 02:00:53.54
Sometimes you had a drink discipline go. Yeah. It's good. Unless last time I was saying how

1208
02:00:53.54 --> 02:00:59.54
the path is a little bit easier. I don't know if the path is actually easier because it's easy.

1209
02:00:59.54 --> 02:01:06.58
Easy is not the right word. Maybe it's comfortable. That doesn't sound like the right word either.

1210
02:01:06.58 --> 02:01:09.78
Because like comfort you want to be capable you want to be comfortable.

1211
02:01:09.78 --> 02:01:14.34
Nonetheless, it's more pleasurable about that. We're drinking discipline go a taste good. It's good

1212
02:01:14.34 --> 02:01:23.14
for you. It's a win-win strategically and tactically. Okay. I think all this stuff is bringing it all up again.

1213
02:01:23.14 --> 02:01:28.10
Oh no, it's lines. All right. Same thing with Moke. You can have some of that taste really,

1235
02:03:34.90 --> 02:03:40.42
cutting it, sewing it. It's just legit. And if you follow that, if you if you've pulled the thread

1236
02:03:40.42 --> 02:03:47.06
on a pair of jeans, you're going to end up in a cotton field in Texas, or in george. Like that's

1243
02:04:28.66 --> 02:04:32.98
figured out how to describe your designs yet. No, it's a work in progress. You know, I see, but

1244
02:04:32.98 --> 02:04:38.26
each time you got to progress, you don't progress to your description. Yeah, but just like, um, what

1252
02:05:14.18 --> 02:05:19.06
seem saying, I got to admit when I learned the master and I saw some people that had,

1253
02:05:19.06 --> 02:05:25.62
you know, shirt locker shirts on totally represent extra level of connection. Yeah. I agree. I'm not

1257
02:05:39.94 --> 02:05:45.78
Got all kinds of topics. We're digging into, um, we don't always agree on stuff. It's come to

1258
02:05:45.78 --> 02:05:52.26
find out the D.C. Sometimes it gets a little hectic in the podcast room. Check out that the

Jockel unrabbling podcast. Check out the grounded podcast. Check out the warrior kid podcast. You can

1262
02:06:10.50 --> 02:06:17.86
topics that are adjacent to yet not fully embedded with Jockel podcast topics, but look,

1263
02:06:18.42 --> 02:06:24.42
even though I think about leadership 20 hours a day, there's other things I think about like

1264
02:06:24.42 --> 02:06:30.74
psychology, like sociology, like questions, do answering questions from people. So there's a lot of

1265
02:06:30.74 --> 02:06:37.22
stuff going on that. Also, it gives us the opportunity to have an alternative platform besides the

1266
02:06:37.22 --> 02:06:44.26
mainstream platforms, which we do not control. We don't mind, you know, being on those platforms,

1267
02:06:44.26 --> 02:06:50.02
but they could make moves that would, we would mind that we would not appreciate and we know you

1268
02:06:50.02 --> 02:06:56.18
wouldn't appreciate. So in order to prevent us from being in a situation that we have lost total

1269
02:06:56.18 --> 02:07:00.98
control, we have some contingency plans. It's called jockel underground. Jockel on around.com.

get involved, go to americazmightywariers.org. And if you want more of my exhaustive explanations or

1325
02:12:33.22 --> 02:12:43.86
you need more of echelons disjoined and delirium. Perhaps you need more of Dave's exhilarated expositions.

1326
02:12:43.86 --> 02:12:49.46
You can find us on the interwebs on Twitter, on the gram and on Facebook. Echoes,

1327
02:12:49.46 --> 02:12:59.22
adecrotrawals. Dave is at David R. Burke and I am at Jockel-Willink and to all the military personnel

1328
02:12:59.22 --> 02:13:07.86
out there. Thank you for taking these tactics that we are talking about and putting them to work

1329
02:13:07.86 --> 02:13:13.38
around the world to keep us free. And the same to our police law enforcement firefighters,

1330
02:13:13.38 --> 02:13:18.42
paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correction officers, border patrol, secret service and all first responders.

1331
02:13:18.42 --> 02:13:34.26
Thank you for keeping us safe here at home and everyone else out there. Well, if you know the way

1332
02:13:34.26 --> 02:13:43.94
broadly, you see it in all things. So I've got an idea. Try your best to open up your eyes,

1333
02:13:43.94 --> 02:13:56.02
look around and see the way in everything that you do. And until next time, this is Dave and Echo

1334
02:13:56.02 --> 02:14:13.14
and Jockel. Out.
