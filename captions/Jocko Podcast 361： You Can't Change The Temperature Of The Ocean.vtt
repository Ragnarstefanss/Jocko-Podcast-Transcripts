00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.16
This is Jocko Podcast number 361 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:04.16 --> 00:00:05.64
Jocko Willink, good evening Echo.

3
00:00:05.64 --> 00:00:06.48
Good evening.

4
00:00:07.56 --> 00:00:10.80
In March of 1969, the Rand Corporation,

5
00:00:10.80 --> 00:00:13.88
a semi-private think tank that specialized in research

6
00:00:13.88 --> 00:00:15.92
and analysis for the Department of Defense,

7
00:00:15.92 --> 00:00:20.12
published a report titled, The Navy Seal Commandos,

8
00:00:20.12 --> 00:00:22.92
a case study of military decision making

9
00:00:22.92 --> 00:00:25.52
and organizational change.

10
00:00:25.52 --> 00:00:28.72
As far as I know, the first academic level study

11
00:00:28.72 --> 00:00:29.96
of the SEAL teams.

12
00:00:29.96 --> 00:00:34.36
The report's author was Francis J. Bing West,

13
00:00:34.36 --> 00:00:37.96
a former force recon Marine in Vietnam War veteran

14
00:00:37.96 --> 00:00:40.08
whose investigation had begun a year earlier

15
00:00:40.08 --> 00:00:43.84
and whose research had produced a raft of documents,

16
00:00:43.84 --> 00:00:47.16
dozens of interviews and the firsthand observation

17
00:00:47.16 --> 00:00:50.84
of several SEAL missions into the Rung Sat and Mekong Delta.

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.88
For this research, West had produced an 18 page report

19
00:00:55.88 --> 00:00:58.64
whose introduction provided a brief description

20
00:00:58.64 --> 00:01:00.88
of SEAL training, training he estimated

21
00:01:00.88 --> 00:01:04.000
at a cost of around $14,000 per man,

22
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.16
plus an overview of the SEAL's commitment to Vietnam

23
00:01:07.16 --> 00:01:11.56
at its height, a commitment that never exceeded 150 SEALs

24
00:01:11.56 --> 00:01:16.56
or roughly 1,150 fewer than the in-country height

25
00:01:16.84 --> 00:01:19.000
of the Green Berets total compliment.

26
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.56
It was a commitment that stood out in even starker relief

27
00:01:23.56 --> 00:01:26.36
when placed next to the author's obvious admiration

28
00:01:26.36 --> 00:01:30.52
for the SEAL's progression from lackluster coastal raiders

29
00:01:30.52 --> 00:01:34.68
to the war's most aggressive direct action commandos.

30
00:01:34.68 --> 00:01:38.000
Admittedly, commandos who had had no business

31
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.32
becoming such and thus had drawn the interest

32
00:01:41.32 --> 00:01:43.48
of the same preeminent think tank

33
00:01:43.48 --> 00:01:47.76
that it created the US military's nuclear defense strategy.

34
00:01:48.92 --> 00:01:51.92
Intended as a study on organizational change,

35
00:01:51.92 --> 00:01:54.80
the report's true purpose had been to discover

36
00:01:54.80 --> 00:01:57.68
how the Navy could have possibly succeeded

37
00:01:57.68 --> 00:02:00.84
in creating a land focused commando force,

38
00:02:00.84 --> 00:02:04.76
a force that even the Viet Cong had reportedly dubbed

39
00:02:04.76 --> 00:02:06.80
the men with green faces,

40
00:02:06.80 --> 00:02:08.44
a color not normally associated

41
00:02:08.44 --> 00:02:10.48
with the Navy's traditional medium.

42
00:02:11.64 --> 00:02:14.40
It was a puzzle of personal importance to the author

43
00:02:14.40 --> 00:02:18.40
as the Marine Corps, the far more likely branch of service

44
00:02:18.40 --> 00:02:21.82
had never succeeded in creating anything similar.

45
00:02:21.82 --> 00:02:25.54
Ultimately, the author decided the most important factor

46
00:02:25.54 --> 00:02:30.54
in the SEAL's infringement was owing to the SEAL's themselves

47
00:02:30.54 --> 00:02:32.46
and the culture that weighed upon them.

48
00:02:33.34 --> 00:02:37.42
Drawn from a notorious lease selective training program

49
00:02:37.42 --> 00:02:40.66
that produced few qualified candidates,

50
00:02:40.66 --> 00:02:44.02
the SEALs naturally had had to find a mission

51
00:02:44.02 --> 00:02:45.90
that kept casualties low,

52
00:02:45.90 --> 00:02:48.38
a circumstance that might have pushed them,

53
00:02:48.38 --> 00:02:51.02
like the LURPs or the force recon Marines

54
00:02:51.02 --> 00:02:52.66
into a reconnaissance role.

55
00:02:52.66 --> 00:02:56.70
Had they had anyone to pass the intelligence to,

56
00:02:56.70 --> 00:03:00.10
they hadn't, nor had there been any great pressure

57
00:03:00.10 --> 00:03:03.82
from the riverine force to engage in any sort of green beret

58
00:03:03.82 --> 00:03:07.02
style advisory, duty or civic action.

59
00:03:07.82 --> 00:03:11.38
Organizational orphans with no larger force

60
00:03:11.38 --> 00:03:13.18
to support or control them

61
00:03:13.18 --> 00:03:17.18
and possessing no love or admiration for the Vietnamese,

62
00:03:17.18 --> 00:03:20.10
the SEALs had set out into the swamps,

63
00:03:20.10 --> 00:03:22.30
not to prove themselves,

64
00:03:22.30 --> 00:03:25.22
the training had already done that, said the author,

65
00:03:25.22 --> 00:03:30.18
but because not to go would have been inexcusable

66
00:03:30.18 --> 00:03:31.34
to the others.

67
00:03:32.30 --> 00:03:34.98
They had developed a collective value system

68
00:03:34.98 --> 00:03:38.98
which emphasized physical hardiness and courage

69
00:03:38.98 --> 00:03:40.88
and they liked to fight.

70
00:03:41.98 --> 00:03:44.46
So when the tactics of patrol and ambush

71
00:03:44.46 --> 00:03:48.54
had proved unproductive, nobody not a SEAL,

72
00:03:48.54 --> 00:03:51.66
meaning no blue water superior officer

73
00:03:51.66 --> 00:03:54.50
had ordered them to try something else,

74
00:03:54.50 --> 00:03:55.78
they had just done it.

75
00:03:57.02 --> 00:03:59.82
What strikes me as most remarkable

76
00:03:59.82 --> 00:04:02.94
about the SEAL story, the author concluded,

77
00:04:02.94 --> 00:04:06.18
is their performance and their ability to learn

78
00:04:06.18 --> 00:04:10.68
and adapt in a decentralized, sub-optimizing environment.

79
00:04:12.32 --> 00:04:14.94
The Navy's traditional latitude

80
00:04:14.94 --> 00:04:17.98
and the UDT's traditional adaptability

81
00:04:17.98 --> 00:04:21.34
created what several unidentified SEALs

82
00:04:21.34 --> 00:04:24.38
soon described to a documentary filmmaker

83
00:04:24.38 --> 00:04:27.06
as the war's unsung soldier

84
00:04:27.06 --> 00:04:30.26
and what we consider without question

85
00:04:30.26 --> 00:04:32.34
the best troops that the country has.

86
00:04:33.50 --> 00:04:34.88
Both descriptions notable

87
00:04:34.88 --> 00:04:37.10
because they didn't use the word sailors

88
00:04:38.04 --> 00:04:40.98
and just short of the reader's digest appraisal

89
00:04:40.98 --> 00:04:44.84
that had dubbed them the war's super commandos.

90
00:04:44.84 --> 00:04:49.28
By the end, these would be assessments

91
00:04:49.28 --> 00:04:51.84
that were next to impossible to dispute.

92
00:04:55.36 --> 00:04:57.04
And that right there is a little excerpt

93
00:04:57.04 --> 00:05:01.92
from the book by Water Beneath the Walls,

94
00:05:01.92 --> 00:05:04.08
a book written by Ben Milligan.

95
00:05:04.08 --> 00:05:05.60
He's been on the podcast a couple of times.

96
00:05:05.60 --> 00:05:09.88
He's a former SEAL and this is indisputably,

97
00:05:09.88 --> 00:05:11.32
speaking of indisputably,

98
00:05:11.32 --> 00:05:13.40
this is the best book about the history

99
00:05:13.40 --> 00:05:16.76
and the emergence of the SEAL teams that's ever been written.

100
00:05:18.20 --> 00:05:20.08
And that section that I just read

101
00:05:20.08 --> 00:05:22.84
is from a section of the book called Culmination,

102
00:05:23.82 --> 00:05:27.20
which is where the roots of the SEAL teams

103
00:05:27.20 --> 00:05:29.88
finally grew into what we ultimately became.

104
00:05:29.88 --> 00:05:33.72
From our frog man forefathers, it was in Vietnam

105
00:05:34.72 --> 00:05:38.24
where the SEALs proved their medal

106
00:05:38.24 --> 00:05:42.60
as a maritime direct action force.

107
00:05:44.26 --> 00:05:49.14
And it is an honor to have one of those Vietnam era SEALs

108
00:05:49.14 --> 00:05:52.18
here with us tonight, Mr. Gil Espinoza

109
00:05:52.18 --> 00:05:55.74
to share his experiences and lessons learned.

110
00:05:55.74 --> 00:05:57.82
Gil, thanks for joining us.

111
00:05:57.82 --> 00:05:58.78
Good evening.

112
00:05:58.78 --> 00:06:02.14
I heard you kind of smiling at some of those descriptions

113
00:06:02.14 --> 00:06:04.90
to that in this book with what was going on.

114
00:06:04.90 --> 00:06:09.90
Yeah, it's kind of interesting of how that,

115
00:06:11.22 --> 00:06:13.42
I think even he looks at us, he's in the teams,

116
00:06:13.42 --> 00:06:15.70
he looks at us, but every frog man has his own way

117
00:06:15.70 --> 00:06:18.94
that he looks at things, every single one of us, right?

118
00:06:18.94 --> 00:06:22.02
And I'm just thinking about other people,

119
00:06:22.02 --> 00:06:24.18
you know what I'm saying, even Roger, right?

120
00:06:24.18 --> 00:06:26.46
His whole mindset and how he looks at it

121
00:06:26.46 --> 00:06:30.54
can be totally different and even operational,

122
00:06:30.54 --> 00:06:32.46
even combat, you get done doing something

123
00:06:32.46 --> 00:06:35.14
and years later you're bullshitting with somebody

124
00:06:35.14 --> 00:06:38.10
and it's kind of like, no, we didn't do that, we did this.

125
00:06:38.10 --> 00:06:40.50
Now how bullshitting, I'm sure it was General.

126
00:06:40.50 --> 00:06:42.30
No, I think it was tax collectors, you know,

127
00:06:42.30 --> 00:06:44.54
I'll go, are you sure?

128
00:06:44.54 --> 00:06:45.82
Even the whole history, right?

129
00:06:45.82 --> 00:06:46.66
Yeah.

130
00:06:46.66 --> 00:06:48.98
And then you have a guy that goes,

131
00:06:48.98 --> 00:06:50.94
was it generals or was it tax collectors?

132
00:06:50.94 --> 00:06:54.46
And another teammate go, well that guy wasn't even there.

133
00:06:54.46 --> 00:06:57.14
So some of our stories, I think some of our stories

134
00:06:57.14 --> 00:06:59.54
get conflicted with other people's stories,

135
00:06:59.54 --> 00:07:03.22
but you do remember the ones that were specifically yours

136
00:07:03.22 --> 00:07:06.62
that came from here and we're talking about

137
00:07:06.62 --> 00:07:08.34
the heart of the frog man, you know,

138
00:07:08.34 --> 00:07:12.22
that I see where he's writing from, you know?

139
00:07:12.22 --> 00:07:15.82
Yeah, no, he does a great job and actually

140
00:07:15.82 --> 00:07:19.62
it's pretty incredible, some of the stuff that he documents,

141
00:07:19.62 --> 00:07:22.62
for instance, there's a scene where Rangers

142
00:07:22.62 --> 00:07:26.26
are being overrun and he's got quotes

143
00:07:26.26 --> 00:07:28.74
of as they're making radio calls,

144
00:07:28.74 --> 00:07:31.74
hey, we're being overrun, we need more support,

145
00:07:31.74 --> 00:07:34.78
God, you know, the commanders, not with them

146
00:07:34.78 --> 00:07:36.82
and he's saying, do the best you can,

147
00:07:36.82 --> 00:07:38.94
God speed, that kind of thing.

148
00:07:38.94 --> 00:07:41.06
And you read it and you're thinking, oh, you know,

149
00:07:41.06 --> 00:07:42.86
he seemed to have done a good job,

150
00:07:42.86 --> 00:07:46.98
sort of coming up with what the dialogue would be.

151
00:07:46.98 --> 00:07:48.54
And then you read the footnote,

152
00:07:48.54 --> 00:07:51.54
it's not something he came up with, it's documented.

153
00:07:51.54 --> 00:07:53.90
These are, there are people writing down the radio calls

154
00:07:53.90 --> 00:07:56.18
and it's exactly what these guys said.

155
00:07:56.18 --> 00:07:58.82
So he's just a very, it took him seven years

156
00:07:58.82 --> 00:08:01.02
to write this book, incredible book.

157
00:08:02.02 --> 00:08:04.66
But nothing better than the horse's mouth

158
00:08:04.66 --> 00:08:06.06
and since we got the horse here.

159
00:08:06.06 --> 00:08:09.10
Well, I've been trying to write a book since I came,

160
00:08:09.10 --> 00:08:11.94
thought it in my head, you know, leaving Vietnam

161
00:08:11.94 --> 00:08:14.30
or being on the fire department and wrestling in college,

162
00:08:14.30 --> 00:08:16.10
I mean, the whole thing coming back home

163
00:08:16.10 --> 00:08:20.02
and looking back into where it all began

164
00:08:20.02 --> 00:08:21.26
from being a little boy.

165
00:08:21.26 --> 00:08:23.06
Well, let's get into it, where did it begin?

166
00:08:23.06 --> 00:08:24.42
Let's start at the beginning.

167
00:08:24.42 --> 00:08:29.26
Well, you can tell I'm not as big as Echo or you, right?

168
00:08:29.26 --> 00:08:31.54
And then when you go to class, you look around,

169
00:08:31.54 --> 00:08:33.58
I mean, look at guys like you and I went,

170
00:08:33.58 --> 00:08:36.78
I was like, what the hell are you doing here, right?

171
00:08:36.78 --> 00:08:39.62
But as a little kid, I was raised in Boulder,

172
00:08:39.62 --> 00:08:43.66
moved from Rocky Ford where I was a little kid to Boulder

173
00:08:43.66 --> 00:08:47.06
and I left all my family, my grandmas, my aunts,

174
00:08:47.06 --> 00:08:49.50
my all my cousins, everybody, everybody in my family,

175
00:08:49.50 --> 00:08:51.54
we're moving to Boulder someplace I never knew.

176
00:08:51.54 --> 00:08:52.62
And this is with your-

177
00:08:52.62 --> 00:08:53.46
My mom and dad.

178
00:08:53.46 --> 00:08:54.30
Your mom and dad.

179
00:08:54.30 --> 00:08:55.14
Right, and my-

180
00:08:55.14 --> 00:08:56.54
What made them decide to move?

181
00:08:57.66 --> 00:09:00.58
Economics, they actually were migrant workers.

182
00:09:00.58 --> 00:09:03.10
My dad became a suck-o-drug contractor

183
00:09:03.10 --> 00:09:05.74
and then later on, it just got really, really hard

184
00:09:05.74 --> 00:09:08.66
and we had an uncle that owned a barber shop in Boulder.

185
00:09:08.66 --> 00:09:11.34
So the family moved where the family was, right?

186
00:09:11.34 --> 00:09:12.86
Just like now, right?

187
00:09:12.86 --> 00:09:15.02
Everybody moves to where you have somebody

188
00:09:15.02 --> 00:09:16.34
to get a foothold in.

189
00:09:19.22 --> 00:09:23.98
So in kindergarten, this kid beat me up, right?

190
00:09:23.98 --> 00:09:25.74
So my brother, I'm kind of whining,

191
00:09:25.74 --> 00:09:27.06
and my brother said, what happened?

192
00:09:27.06 --> 00:09:27.90
What's up?

193
00:09:27.90 --> 00:09:30.78
I said, well, that guy, John and Maya beat me up.

194
00:09:30.78 --> 00:09:32.42
John and Maya, I know his brother.

195
00:09:32.42 --> 00:09:35.10
And also they dragged me to his place.

196
00:09:35.10 --> 00:09:37.10
And my brother was my hero.

197
00:09:37.10 --> 00:09:38.54
When I was like five years old,

198
00:09:38.54 --> 00:09:41.26
when I was five years old, I was doing chin-ups.

199
00:09:41.26 --> 00:09:42.46
When I remember when I was one,

200
00:09:42.46 --> 00:09:45.02
he'd hang me on a door and walk out and leave me.

201
00:09:45.02 --> 00:09:47.46
He'd come around and I got to where I'm one or two

202
00:09:47.46 --> 00:09:49.02
and finally he had a look around

203
00:09:49.02 --> 00:09:50.34
and I remember I was like three or four,

204
00:09:50.34 --> 00:09:52.38
I could get my elbow up on the door, right?

205
00:09:52.38 --> 00:09:54.22
And he'd had me doing chin-ups.

206
00:09:54.22 --> 00:09:56.10
We had a rope for a swing.

207
00:09:56.10 --> 00:09:58.42
He had me climbing up that rope when I was five.

208
00:09:58.42 --> 00:09:59.58
When I was five, I could.

209
00:09:59.58 --> 00:10:00.58
What year is this?

210
00:10:00.58 --> 00:10:02.54
So this is like 1953 or 19,

211
00:10:02.54 --> 00:10:04.94
because you were born in what, 1947?

212
00:10:04.94 --> 00:10:07.90
Yeah, so I was five years old, it was 53.

213
00:10:07.90 --> 00:10:09.86
So your brother had, your older brother had

214
00:10:09.86 --> 00:10:13.42
like a early start on the physical culture.

215
00:10:13.42 --> 00:10:14.46
Yeah, he was a wrestler.

216
00:10:14.46 --> 00:10:16.14
He was just in, oh, so he was a wrestler.

217
00:10:16.14 --> 00:10:19.26
His wrestler, and then when he went to Boulder,

218
00:10:19.26 --> 00:10:21.02
he's kicking the hell out of the guys in Boulder,

219
00:10:21.02 --> 00:10:24.54
but they were still the underlying racist stuff.

220
00:10:24.54 --> 00:10:27.94
And so what, so what are you, you're Native American?

221
00:10:27.94 --> 00:10:29.42
Well, from the Pickers' point of my mind,

222
00:10:29.42 --> 00:10:33.30
Grandma's Pickers, we identify mainly as Spanish, right?

223
00:10:33.30 --> 00:10:35.34
Not Mexicano, not Mexican,

224
00:10:35.34 --> 00:10:37.34
because our people did not come up from Mexico.

225
00:10:37.34 --> 00:10:40.54
They came from, you know, from Spain,

226
00:10:40.54 --> 00:10:42.82
from through California, then to New Mexico,

227
00:10:42.82 --> 00:10:45.46
through establishing through the Spanish land grants,

228
00:10:45.46 --> 00:10:48.62
and then with the mestizos, right, the Native Americans,

229
00:10:48.62 --> 00:10:51.14
the blended culture, right?

230
00:10:51.14 --> 00:10:54.78
And so then everything, the subsistence living,

231
00:10:54.78 --> 00:10:57.06
then the government comes in and says,

232
00:10:57.06 --> 00:10:59.78
you gotta pay taxes, it was all subsistence.

233
00:10:59.78 --> 00:11:01.14
So how are they gonna pay taxes

234
00:11:01.14 --> 00:11:03.22
when they never really made any money,

235
00:11:03.22 --> 00:11:06.86
but you would trade 10 chickens for a cow or whatever.

236
00:11:06.86 --> 00:11:07.70
I mean, there was always-

237
00:11:07.70 --> 00:11:09.54
So they were doing old school barter.

238
00:11:09.54 --> 00:11:10.90
Old school barter.

239
00:11:10.90 --> 00:11:14.98
And then they had to sell their land and then move.

240
00:11:14.98 --> 00:11:18.34
And my dad's family had some Spanish land grant stuff,

241
00:11:18.34 --> 00:11:22.82
so his stepfather, my dad's dad died when he was like, baby.

242
00:11:22.82 --> 00:11:24.54
My dad says the government came in

243
00:11:24.54 --> 00:11:26.74
and gave all the men shots, step-tury shots,

244
00:11:26.74 --> 00:11:29.42
and you know, guys died.

245
00:11:29.42 --> 00:11:32.22
And so they moved and got up to Rocky Ford

246
00:11:32.22 --> 00:11:35.22
and established themselves as a community.

247
00:11:35.22 --> 00:11:37.70
All my cousins lived on one block.

248
00:11:37.70 --> 00:11:39.30
There was my uncle and my grandma,

249
00:11:39.30 --> 00:11:42.42
my other uncle, all of us lived on one block.

250
00:11:42.42 --> 00:11:44.78
And literally there was a train track

251
00:11:44.78 --> 00:11:46.74
in the back of our yard.

252
00:11:46.74 --> 00:11:49.66
And there was one, it was kind of like a cul-de-sac

253
00:11:49.66 --> 00:11:50.78
that went out to a main road.

254
00:11:50.78 --> 00:11:54.10
And on the other side was a ditch, water.

255
00:11:54.10 --> 00:11:55.90
Smell kind of like the Mekong man.

256
00:11:55.90 --> 00:11:59.82
So when I was in Vietnam, I said,

257
00:11:59.82 --> 00:12:04.26
I was like, what kind of smells like that?

258
00:12:04.26 --> 00:12:07.50
So I was between a railroad track and a river, right?

259
00:12:07.50 --> 00:12:08.62
And we were always told,

260
00:12:08.62 --> 00:12:11.90
don't play on the tracks and don't play on the river.

261
00:12:11.90 --> 00:12:13.98
Six, five years old, we had a pipe

262
00:12:13.98 --> 00:12:16.26
that went across that river, right?

263
00:12:16.26 --> 00:12:18.14
It's a slow man, it's a slow ditch.

264
00:12:20.06 --> 00:12:22.82
Our deal of manhood or whatever it was as cousins

265
00:12:22.82 --> 00:12:26.06
were all about the same age was to go across the ditch,

266
00:12:26.06 --> 00:12:27.82
hanging upside down, going up.

267
00:12:27.82 --> 00:12:29.22
And then it was not a swim.

268
00:12:30.46 --> 00:12:31.82
But that's where I'm getting to the point

269
00:12:31.82 --> 00:12:34.78
of being the young boy, little boy, right?

270
00:12:34.78 --> 00:12:37.94
No fear, you don't have that until somebody tells you,

271
00:12:37.94 --> 00:12:39.50
don't go into the ditch, you're gonna drown.

272
00:12:39.50 --> 00:12:41.78
You don't know what drowning is until somebody,

273
00:12:41.78 --> 00:12:43.50
till you do want a bit of swimming pool,

274
00:12:43.50 --> 00:12:45.78
you go, I could drown, right?

275
00:12:45.78 --> 00:12:48.90
But you don't have that fear, you know?

276
00:12:48.90 --> 00:12:51.02
You don't know that you're black,

277
00:12:51.02 --> 00:12:51.94
you don't know that you're brown,

278
00:12:51.94 --> 00:12:52.82
you don't know that you're white,

279
00:12:52.82 --> 00:12:55.30
you don't know any of that stuff, you're a kid, right?

280
00:12:55.30 --> 00:12:56.62
Intelligent, loving, caring,

281
00:12:56.62 --> 00:12:58.70
that natural curiosity and zest for life,

282
00:12:58.70 --> 00:13:01.70
that powerful person as a little boy.

283
00:13:01.70 --> 00:13:05.14
Well, I got my ass kicked by John Amaya, right?

284
00:13:05.14 --> 00:13:06.78
You didn't know you'd get your ass kicked

285
00:13:06.78 --> 00:13:09.26
until John Amaya kicked your ass.

286
00:13:09.26 --> 00:13:11.54
Yeah, I had climbing ropes, I was having a good time,

287
00:13:11.54 --> 00:13:14.18
I'm a kid, and I think all kids are like that, right?

288
00:13:14.18 --> 00:13:16.66
Initially, well, they're all like that.

289
00:13:16.66 --> 00:13:18.70
And so, my brother takes me over there,

290
00:13:18.70 --> 00:13:22.02
and he says, had this kid come out,

291
00:13:22.02 --> 00:13:23.50
he holds it as brother, they come out,

292
00:13:23.50 --> 00:13:26.62
and I'm like, you know, in order to maintain that part

293
00:13:26.62 --> 00:13:27.94
that you're intelligent, loving, caring,

294
00:13:27.94 --> 00:13:29.74
with that natural curiosity and zest for life,

295
00:13:29.74 --> 00:13:31.90
you have these natural physiological releases,

296
00:13:31.90 --> 00:13:35.30
which are laughing, talking, crying, shaking, sweating,

297
00:13:35.30 --> 00:13:36.94
yawning, and all that stuff, right?

298
00:13:36.94 --> 00:13:41.30
To keep that, to keep that intact, right?

299
00:13:41.30 --> 00:13:42.46
So I'm going through all that stuff,

300
00:13:42.46 --> 00:13:45.94
and my brother had a warrior brother, right?

301
00:13:45.94 --> 00:13:47.90
He wanted to make sure, he knew I was going to get

302
00:13:47.90 --> 00:13:49.62
my ass kicked on as a kid.

303
00:13:49.62 --> 00:13:51.98
So he took, because I'm sure it happened to him,

304
00:13:51.98 --> 00:13:53.46
but he was my older brother, I didn't know that stuff.

305
00:13:53.46 --> 00:13:54.90
How much older was he then?

306
00:13:54.90 --> 00:13:55.74
Nine years old.

307
00:13:55.74 --> 00:13:57.18
Oh, dang, so that's a big spread.

308
00:13:57.18 --> 00:13:59.30
So he's a real, like, hero to you.

309
00:13:59.30 --> 00:14:01.66
Oh, man, yeah.

310
00:14:01.66 --> 00:14:05.14
He's a chief, retired Navy chief, he went to the Navy.

311
00:14:05.14 --> 00:14:06.54
How'd I want to fit in the Navy?

312
00:14:06.54 --> 00:14:10.54
So, this kid comes out, and my brother next to me goes,

313
00:14:10.54 --> 00:14:12.78
now remember, remember that little, he showed me

314
00:14:12.78 --> 00:14:14.74
a duck under, right?

315
00:14:14.74 --> 00:14:17.42
A duck under, and a high crotch in the throat.

316
00:14:17.42 --> 00:14:18.58
He said, just do that.

317
00:14:18.58 --> 00:14:21.26
I'm going, because I mean, I couldn't really do it

318
00:14:21.26 --> 00:14:23.66
to him, my brother, but he would show me.

319
00:14:23.66 --> 00:14:25.62
I said, all right, so I came up, the kid,

320
00:14:25.62 --> 00:14:27.34
come underneath, I grabbed him with the duck under,

321
00:14:27.34 --> 00:14:29.78
threw him down, he says, and when you throw him down,

322
00:14:29.78 --> 00:14:32.46
sit on him and make him say, uncle.

323
00:14:32.46 --> 00:14:34.26
I mean, that was the old rule of the old days, right?

324
00:14:34.26 --> 00:14:36.26
Threw him down, I'm saying, say uncle, you know?

325
00:14:36.26 --> 00:14:37.78
Okay, uncle.

326
00:14:37.78 --> 00:14:42.78
My brother, then he says, don't ever let anybody,

327
00:14:42.90 --> 00:14:43.90
don't let your brother mess around,

328
00:14:43.90 --> 00:14:44.86
anybody mess with my brother,

329
00:14:44.86 --> 00:14:46.14
you just let him know I've got his back.

330
00:14:46.14 --> 00:14:48.14
So, I go to school, back to Liberty, right?

331
00:14:48.14 --> 00:14:51.06
Great school in Rocky Fort, and everybody,

332
00:14:51.06 --> 00:14:53.46
watch out for that little guy, they call me Tuffy.

333
00:14:53.46 --> 00:14:55.10
I didn't know.

334
00:14:55.94 --> 00:14:59.30
So, then when we left Rocky Fort, I'm crying all the way

335
00:14:59.30 --> 00:15:04.30
from Rocky Fort to Boulder, and my dad gets tired of it.

336
00:15:04.30 --> 00:15:08.34
He says, God, did he give me, he stopped at the overlook.

337
00:15:08.34 --> 00:15:09.90
You ever been to Boulder, Colorado?

338
00:15:09.90 --> 00:15:11.38
No.

339
00:15:11.38 --> 00:15:15.22
When you come down into it, it's beautiful, I didn't.

340
00:15:15.22 --> 00:15:18.78
So, I'm crying, my dad grabs me, pulls off the side of the

341
00:15:18.78 --> 00:15:20.22
road, grabs me, and throws me in the back.

342
00:15:20.22 --> 00:15:21.94
I don't know if I'm going, right?

343
00:15:21.94 --> 00:15:25.26
As we were coming over this hill, I'm thinking,

344
00:15:25.26 --> 00:15:28.86
I don't have anybody, that aloneness, being alone,

345
00:15:28.86 --> 00:15:30.14
like when you start training, right?

346
00:15:30.14 --> 00:15:32.62
Or you go in the Navy, where you feel that you're alone,

347
00:15:32.62 --> 00:15:34.82
or anytime that you left the islands, right?

348
00:15:36.78 --> 00:15:39.82
And for a little boy to be alone, that was the beginning

349
00:15:39.82 --> 00:15:40.94
of being a frogman.

350
00:15:40.94 --> 00:15:43.14
I look at it now, right?

351
00:15:43.14 --> 00:15:47.34
And so, when we came over, I looked, I picked up,

352
00:15:47.34 --> 00:15:48.70
because he threw me in the back of the truck,

353
00:15:48.70 --> 00:15:51.74
got tired of me being inside, in here.

354
00:15:51.74 --> 00:15:55.38
And I think the thing is we, those of us who are

355
00:15:55.38 --> 00:15:58.62
introspective, or really searching for what is,

356
00:15:58.62 --> 00:16:00.06
who we are, right?

357
00:16:00.06 --> 00:16:03.90
That little boy is always who we were, but it gets

358
00:16:03.90 --> 00:16:05.54
covered up by all the bullshit.

359
00:16:05.54 --> 00:16:09.58
Well, when I went over and I looked, I saw these

360
00:16:09.58 --> 00:16:13.14
mountains, and in my heart, I heard, no, we're here,

361
00:16:13.14 --> 00:16:14.98
and we'll be your friends forever.

362
00:16:14.98 --> 00:16:16.66
And it was a squaw and a brave.

363
00:16:16.66 --> 00:16:18.58
I look at them, I could see the silhouettes of them,

364
00:16:18.58 --> 00:16:22.50
I went, and I looked down, and I saw the shining lights.

365
00:16:24.66 --> 00:16:27.14
It's the same thing that I got when I saw Point Loma,

366
00:16:27.14 --> 00:16:28.78
when I was going to Vietnam, right?

367
00:16:28.78 --> 00:16:32.50
And I saw Point Loma and the fingers pointing,

368
00:16:32.50 --> 00:16:34.86
that way to Vietnam, right?

369
00:16:34.86 --> 00:16:39.26
But when I sensed that, I went, okay, so I go to school

370
00:16:39.26 --> 00:16:44.26
and boulder, and I got dang, Charlie Mestis beats me

371
00:16:44.58 --> 00:16:45.42
up to first day.

372
00:16:45.42 --> 00:16:50.42
And my brother, I was like, seven, or seven or eight.

373
00:16:52.34 --> 00:16:54.30
And I didn't want to tell my brother, because I didn't,

374
00:16:54.30 --> 00:16:55.98
you know, I didn't want to go.

375
00:16:55.98 --> 00:16:58.86
Didn't want him to set up another prize fight for you.

376
00:16:58.86 --> 00:17:02.66
Right, so I got my ass kicked for five days,

377
00:17:02.66 --> 00:17:04.90
figuring it out, and that's when I understood

378
00:17:04.90 --> 00:17:06.02
the inside warrior.

379
00:17:07.42 --> 00:17:09.42
The inside warrior is the one that talks to you,

380
00:17:09.42 --> 00:17:10.98
that goes, boom, you get hit here,

381
00:17:10.98 --> 00:17:13.30
and it's kind of like figuring stuff out,

382
00:17:13.30 --> 00:17:14.74
just like your first wrestling match,

383
00:17:14.74 --> 00:17:17.50
or Jiu Jitsu, or your first appointment, right?

384
00:17:17.50 --> 00:17:19.54
And I felt that that's what I was doing.

385
00:17:19.54 --> 00:17:22.54
I was sensing and understanding it.

386
00:17:22.54 --> 00:17:27.02
And then one day the outside warrior came in.

387
00:17:29.18 --> 00:17:31.26
He came in, I grabbed hold of Charlie, man,

388
00:17:31.26 --> 00:17:33.34
I hit him with that high cross, dropped him down,

389
00:17:33.34 --> 00:17:36.26
you know, and just started, and two times in my life,

390
00:17:36.26 --> 00:17:39.06
that time when I started beating him badly,

391
00:17:39.06 --> 00:17:40.86
another time when I came back from Vietnam,

392
00:17:40.86 --> 00:17:43.82
I got in a fight with a guy, it felt like,

393
00:17:43.82 --> 00:17:45.70
and you never see the Patriot, you know,

394
00:17:45.70 --> 00:17:49.36
when he hacks up that guy that kills his son.

395
00:17:49.36 --> 00:17:53.40
When I saw that movie, I started crying,

396
00:17:53.40 --> 00:17:55.60
because that's the way I felt, right?

397
00:17:55.60 --> 00:17:57.90
That's totally not out of control.

398
00:17:57.90 --> 00:17:59.24
You don't ever have these flashbacks

399
00:17:59.24 --> 00:18:00.76
where you're totally out of control,

400
00:18:00.76 --> 00:18:04.04
and it's always, Calc, it's always the inside,

401
00:18:04.04 --> 00:18:06.52
the outside warrior always understands

402
00:18:06.52 --> 00:18:08.16
what's happening and what he's doing,

403
00:18:08.16 --> 00:18:10.36
it's just that when does he feel like stopping?

404
00:18:10.36 --> 00:18:12.90
And the inside warrior says, that's enough.

405
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.72
But they both cover up the little boy,

406
00:18:15.72 --> 00:18:17.48
because the little boy would have never wanted

407
00:18:17.48 --> 00:18:19.000
to have that fight in the first place.

408
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.68
He wants to be a little kid.

409
00:18:20.68 --> 00:18:23.36
So rather than asking myself, and I did ask myself,

410
00:18:23.36 --> 00:18:25.26
what's wrong with me?

411
00:18:25.26 --> 00:18:27.28
That's not even the question.

412
00:18:27.28 --> 00:18:30.000
The question is, what's wrong with Charlie?

413
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.16
Why is he jacked up, you know?

414
00:18:34.16 --> 00:18:37.64
And then later on, I kind of became Charlie.

415
00:18:37.64 --> 00:18:39.96
But when you find out that you can wrestle

416
00:18:39.96 --> 00:18:42.40
and you're a pretty tough guy, then you're picking on guys

417
00:18:42.40 --> 00:18:44.04
that you know you shouldn't even be picking on,

418
00:18:44.04 --> 00:18:45.40
but they don't know how to wrestle.

419
00:18:45.40 --> 00:18:46.80
They're big guys that don't know how to wrestle,

420
00:18:46.80 --> 00:18:48.38
but you do.

421
00:18:48.38 --> 00:18:53.38
So I won that fight, and then what happens?

422
00:18:54.92 --> 00:18:56.88
Another guy named Terry Fox, big guy,

423
00:18:56.88 --> 00:18:58.84
he wanted to beat the hell out of me.

424
00:18:58.84 --> 00:19:01.84
So I'm like, what the hell, trying to figure this out?

425
00:19:01.84 --> 00:19:06.32
And that was the very first time that an ally came in.

426
00:19:06.32 --> 00:19:08.04
And he was Mike Martinez.

427
00:19:08.04 --> 00:19:09.92
And he said, hey man, he says,

428
00:19:09.92 --> 00:19:11.28
he's too little for you to fight.

429
00:19:11.28 --> 00:19:16.28
He said, when you fight me, I understood allies, you know?

430
00:19:16.28 --> 00:19:18.52
And so I called him Uncle Mike.

431
00:19:18.52 --> 00:19:21.80
And let everybody know he's my nephew.

432
00:19:21.80 --> 00:19:23.20
What grade are you in at this point?

433
00:19:23.20 --> 00:19:26.16
That one, that was in second grade.

434
00:19:26.16 --> 00:19:27.000
Dang.

435
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.36
You know, so that happened.

436
00:19:29.36 --> 00:19:31.32
So that was my life, right?

437
00:19:31.32 --> 00:19:36.32
And then I came into this group,

438
00:19:36.32 --> 00:19:38.44
it's called the God Street neighborhood, right?

439
00:19:38.44 --> 00:19:40.96
It was right after the war, we were all born in 47,

440
00:19:40.96 --> 00:19:45.56
most of us, the poor whites, the Jews,

441
00:19:45.56 --> 00:19:48.40
the blacks that worked on the train,

442
00:19:49.52 --> 00:19:53.24
the Polish, the guys left over from World War II,

443
00:19:53.24 --> 00:19:57.24
the Mexicanos and a couple Japanese guys, right?

444
00:19:57.24 --> 00:19:58.08
That was-

445
00:19:58.08 --> 00:19:58.92
This is your neighborhood?

446
00:19:58.92 --> 00:20:00.44
That was my neighborhood on God Street in Boulder, right?

447
00:20:00.44 --> 00:20:03.80
So when people say it takes a village or is it a town,

448
00:20:03.80 --> 00:20:04.64
that's bullshit.

449
00:20:05.68 --> 00:20:06.90
Because it takes,

450
00:20:08.96 --> 00:20:11.20
if I have not picked up something that wasn't mine,

451
00:20:11.20 --> 00:20:13.56
Mr. Toledo's sitting on the front porch.

452
00:20:13.56 --> 00:20:14.40
Is that yours?

453
00:20:14.40 --> 00:20:17.24
No, man, put the goddamn thing down.

454
00:20:19.24 --> 00:20:21.48
Or you're cutting school, what are you guys doing over here?

455
00:20:21.48 --> 00:20:23.96
You mean, you know, when you're supposed to be in school?

456
00:20:23.96 --> 00:20:26.20
Yeah, so there was always this, my mom said,

457
00:20:26.20 --> 00:20:27.36
what were you doing over there?

458
00:20:27.36 --> 00:20:30.68
And I'm going, well, I wasn't there lying right away,

459
00:20:30.68 --> 00:20:32.88
you know, kind of like going through seal training, man.

460
00:20:32.88 --> 00:20:35.64
You start lying, cheat, steal, do whatever you can do

461
00:20:35.64 --> 00:20:39.000
to get through this training, but don't get caught, right?

462
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.08
Oliver and Chief Allen, don't get caught.

463
00:20:41.08 --> 00:20:43.36
That's Mr. Toledo and Ms. Martinez and Mr. Rannies,

464
00:20:43.36 --> 00:20:44.20
you know, don't get caught.

465
00:20:44.20 --> 00:20:46.44
And then when you got caught, my mom,

466
00:20:47.60 --> 00:20:48.44
how do you know that?

467
00:20:48.44 --> 00:20:50.64
This isn't, little bird told me.

468
00:20:51.60 --> 00:20:54.08
So I'm like, who in the hell is this little bird?

469
00:20:54.08 --> 00:20:55.48
It's a little bird called a rat.

470
00:20:55.48 --> 00:20:57.000
It was all of them, you know,

471
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.92
but that was that neighborhood of caring people

472
00:20:58.92 --> 00:21:01.40
that really care about you, but what's going on?

473
00:21:01.40 --> 00:21:03.88
Not because you're Mexicans or not because you're Spanish,

474
00:21:03.88 --> 00:21:06.20
not because you're white, because this is your neighborhood,

475
00:21:06.20 --> 00:21:07.16
this is where you belong.

476
00:21:07.16 --> 00:21:10.76
This was my, and it isn't an identity thing,

477
00:21:10.76 --> 00:21:14.000
it's a belonging thing that you know they're invested in

478
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.36
in you and the deal was all of us are going to go to school.

479
00:21:18.36 --> 00:21:20.24
We're all not gonna cut school.

480
00:21:20.24 --> 00:21:22.80
There was a black guy and we had to give up our language.

481
00:21:22.80 --> 00:21:24.96
Those of us were Spanish, right?

482
00:21:24.96 --> 00:21:26.84
Don't speak Spanish in school.

483
00:21:26.84 --> 00:21:28.80
So we're getting ready to go to school.

484
00:21:29.76 --> 00:21:30.60
Well, this is in high school,

485
00:21:30.60 --> 00:21:32.84
but in junior high it was the same thing.

486
00:21:32.84 --> 00:21:36.80
I go to junior high, there's this guy, Nick Crispin, right?

487
00:21:37.56 --> 00:21:40.28
The bad ass kid in school, the ninth grader

488
00:21:40.28 --> 00:21:45.28
and I'm seventh grade, little beat up this kid.

489
00:21:45.72 --> 00:21:47.000
I said, I don't even know that kid.

490
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.36
Well, if you don't beat him up, I'll beat you up.

491
00:21:49.36 --> 00:21:52.80
So it's like, ah, so I don't want to get beat up,

492
00:21:52.80 --> 00:21:55.72
so I beat up a kid that I beat him up.

493
00:21:55.72 --> 00:21:58.16
And so then, but then what happens inside, right?

494
00:21:58.16 --> 00:22:00.08
That heart, that thing that comes in, goes,

495
00:22:00.08 --> 00:22:01.88
this isn't right.

496
00:22:01.88 --> 00:22:04.52
So I went up to the guy and I said, hey, look man,

497
00:22:05.56 --> 00:22:06.80
I said, we might as well fight now

498
00:22:06.80 --> 00:22:08.68
because I'm not gonna do that again.

499
00:22:08.68 --> 00:22:10.40
Oh no, you're cool, you're cool.

500
00:22:11.68 --> 00:22:13.92
And inside I was crying because I beat up a guy

501
00:22:13.92 --> 00:22:16.16
that I didn't and oh no, you're cool.

502
00:22:16.16 --> 00:22:18.84
And so then I understood a bully.

503
00:22:18.84 --> 00:22:20.84
I understood what they're gonna make me do

504
00:22:20.84 --> 00:22:23.36
if I don't make a choice, right?

505
00:22:23.36 --> 00:22:25.48
So I go through that, I go to the bathroom.

506
00:22:27.24 --> 00:22:29.20
Nick's, what was the guy named Nick?

507
00:22:29.20 --> 00:22:31.12
This guy named Chuck and this guy named Rich.

508
00:22:31.12 --> 00:22:33.000
I won't say their last names because they're all dead,

509
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.84
but I don't really like those guys anyway.

510
00:22:35.84 --> 00:22:38.000
So I'm in there taking the leak and the guy comes in

511
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.96
and say, what are you doing here?

512
00:22:39.96 --> 00:22:43.32
And I look up and it says, oh, seventh grade, right?

513
00:22:43.32 --> 00:22:45.16
It's innocence, right?

514
00:22:45.16 --> 00:22:46.64
The innocence.

515
00:22:46.64 --> 00:22:49.48
And I said, so who are you?

516
00:22:49.48 --> 00:22:51.80
I said, I'm Gilaz Panosa.

517
00:22:51.80 --> 00:22:52.96
Well yeah, I said, who are you guys?

518
00:22:52.96 --> 00:22:54.36
Well, we're here to beat the shit out of you.

519
00:22:54.36 --> 00:22:57.56
I'm like, come on man.

520
00:22:58.72 --> 00:23:01.32
I'm so little, I'm so little as about like this.

521
00:23:01.32 --> 00:23:03.80
I was like four foot, I was smaller than her.

522
00:23:03.80 --> 00:23:07.84
She shorter than Herbie Corral, Herbie Corral.

523
00:23:07.84 --> 00:23:10.08
That's why he and I are, we're good buddies,

524
00:23:10.08 --> 00:23:11.12
because we're both little guys.

525
00:23:11.12 --> 00:23:12.52
Cause we're little guys in the teams.

526
00:23:12.52 --> 00:23:13.36
For sure.

527
00:23:13.36 --> 00:23:14.80
And then there are little guys in the teams

528
00:23:14.80 --> 00:23:18.000
and big little guys like Herbie Corral's a big little guy.

529
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.88
There are other ones that are,

530
00:23:19.88 --> 00:23:21.68
they're like you guys were shrunk down.

531
00:23:21.68 --> 00:23:26.68
I was a skinny guy, 120 pounds, carrying 90 pounds of gear

532
00:23:26.80 --> 00:23:28.40
up in the Macau.

533
00:23:28.40 --> 00:23:31.000
And when I was working with the Pruse

534
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.28
and working with the Vietnamese SEALs,

535
00:23:32.28 --> 00:23:35.56
I carried an M60 with 800 rounds.

536
00:23:35.56 --> 00:23:37.80
So we went heavy on the border, right?

537
00:23:37.80 --> 00:23:41.08
So, I'm like, shoot.

538
00:23:41.08 --> 00:23:42.16
And so.

539
00:23:42.16 --> 00:23:44.08
So what happened to, so did you fight these guys?

540
00:23:44.08 --> 00:23:45.12
Well, so then what happened,

541
00:23:45.12 --> 00:23:49.12
this guy Bruce McDowell steps in, he was from Hawaii

542
00:23:49.12 --> 00:23:51.76
and he steps in and he goes, what's going on in here?

543
00:23:51.76 --> 00:23:54.36
And I'm going, those guys want to beat me up.

544
00:23:54.36 --> 00:23:56.68
And he goes, oh, he's, you see, hey guys,

545
00:23:56.68 --> 00:23:57.52
you're way too big for him.

546
00:23:57.52 --> 00:24:01.08
But the little neck, he looked at me, he's really cool.

547
00:24:01.08 --> 00:24:06.08
He says, if I stay here, you want to fight that little guy?

548
00:24:06.08 --> 00:24:10.24
And I'm already, I'm shaking, man.

549
00:24:10.24 --> 00:24:11.56
I got tears in my eyes.

550
00:24:11.56 --> 00:24:12.92
I'm like, I'm alone.

551
00:24:12.92 --> 00:24:13.96
And you're in seventh grade.

552
00:24:13.96 --> 00:24:14.88
I'm in seventh grade.

553
00:24:14.88 --> 00:24:16.40
I'm alone.

554
00:24:16.40 --> 00:24:18.84
And all the guys from God Street,

555
00:24:18.84 --> 00:24:20.44
we came to school together.

556
00:24:20.44 --> 00:24:23.64
We didn't realize that the classism was happening.

557
00:24:23.64 --> 00:24:25.52
There's classism and racism, right?

558
00:24:25.52 --> 00:24:29.40
Well, the classism took all of us poor people together, right?

559
00:24:29.40 --> 00:24:31.12
Didn't matter whether you were white or whatever,

560
00:24:31.12 --> 00:24:33.32
that was, they called our street Sin City.

561
00:24:33.32 --> 00:24:35.92
We didn't even know it to where we were already men.

562
00:24:35.92 --> 00:24:38.24
We didn't know that that's what they called our neighborhood.

563
00:24:38.24 --> 00:24:41.52
And so, hey, going, yeah.

564
00:24:41.52 --> 00:24:43.24
He says, well, okay.

565
00:24:43.24 --> 00:24:44.68
So I hit him with that move, man.

566
00:24:44.68 --> 00:24:46.56
High cries come around, boom, hit him,

567
00:24:46.56 --> 00:24:47.68
put him in the urinal.

568
00:24:47.68 --> 00:24:52.12
And next thing you know, I, outside warrior was working, man.

569
00:24:52.12 --> 00:24:54.08
It was high order, right?

570
00:24:54.08 --> 00:24:56.28
I love the word high order when we went into the teams, man.

571
00:24:56.28 --> 00:24:58.40
Cause that means your high order.

572
00:24:58.40 --> 00:24:59.96
It's a high order detonation, man.

573
00:24:59.96 --> 00:25:00.88
I was in it.

574
00:25:00.88 --> 00:25:02.88
I took him, I put his head in the toilet

575
00:25:02.88 --> 00:25:05.68
and I sat on his back and started flushing it.

576
00:25:05.68 --> 00:25:06.56
And that was screaming.

577
00:25:06.56 --> 00:25:10.32
You know, like when, when you, when you're in the cold water,

578
00:25:10.32 --> 00:25:14.72
that whole thing, you know, just keeping your shit together.

579
00:25:14.72 --> 00:25:15.56
Right?

580
00:25:15.56 --> 00:25:16.40
I'm screaming.

581
00:25:16.40 --> 00:25:19.92
Next thing I'm picked up out of the, off this guy,

582
00:25:19.92 --> 00:25:21.16
Bruce McDowell takes me over,

583
00:25:21.16 --> 00:25:23.76
takes me in the corner, it's a breeze.

584
00:25:23.76 --> 00:25:25.92
And I'm like, so you know,

585
00:25:25.92 --> 00:25:27.68
breeze, he tells those guys get the hell out of here.

586
00:25:27.68 --> 00:25:31.48
And I'm like, and so he says, Hey, he says, it's a calm.

587
00:25:31.48 --> 00:25:33.68
You know, it's come down like, breathe, I'm breathing.

588
00:25:33.68 --> 00:25:37.44
He says, Hey, I says, do you ever wrestle?

589
00:25:37.44 --> 00:25:39.36
I wrestle, my brother told me to wrestle and move,

590
00:25:39.36 --> 00:25:42.72
but he went in the Navy and I'm alone.

591
00:25:42.72 --> 00:25:44.24
He said, look, wait a minute, wait a minute.

592
00:25:44.24 --> 00:25:46.20
He says, you ever think about wrestling?

593
00:25:46.20 --> 00:25:48.28
We have a wrestling team here.

594
00:25:48.28 --> 00:25:49.52
I said, no.

595
00:25:49.52 --> 00:25:51.36
He said, well, and you, and you'd be wrestling guys,

596
00:25:51.36 --> 00:25:54.04
your size, not big guy, little guys, your size.

597
00:25:54.04 --> 00:25:55.76
He says, you ought to come out.

598
00:25:55.76 --> 00:25:57.04
Maybe.

599
00:25:57.04 --> 00:25:57.88
Right?

600
00:25:57.88 --> 00:25:59.68
So that, and that was the beginning

601
00:25:59.68 --> 00:26:01.44
of another evolution, right?

602
00:26:01.44 --> 00:26:02.48
So I went to wrestle,

603
00:26:02.48 --> 00:26:05.32
but I found out I was wrestling,

604
00:26:05.32 --> 00:26:07.80
I was wrestling for all the wrong reason.

605
00:26:07.80 --> 00:26:09.88
I was wrestling to learn how to fight,

606
00:26:09.88 --> 00:26:12.16
wrestling, to learn how to protect myself to wrestling.

607
00:26:12.16 --> 00:26:14.48
So I didn't have to, with the bully came,

608
00:26:14.48 --> 00:26:17.40
I didn't have to bow down to him,

609
00:26:17.40 --> 00:26:19.28
that I didn't have to serve anybody.

610
00:26:20.20 --> 00:26:23.24
Those seems like actually good reasons for me to wrestle.

611
00:26:23.24 --> 00:26:24.48
You said those are the wrong reasons.

612
00:26:24.48 --> 00:26:25.32
I don't know.

613
00:26:25.32 --> 00:26:27.000
As far as I'm concerned, I tell kids to wrestle all the time.

614
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.20
And I tell them, you're going to be able to take care of

615
00:26:28.20 --> 00:26:30.76
yourself, you're going to get good shape.

616
00:26:30.76 --> 00:26:31.88
I'm like, those are good reasons.

617
00:26:31.88 --> 00:26:33.72
But I wasn't happy doing it.

618
00:26:33.72 --> 00:26:34.60
Do you know what I mean?

619
00:26:34.60 --> 00:26:35.44
Got it.

620
00:26:35.44 --> 00:26:36.52
There are kids that are happy.

621
00:26:36.52 --> 00:26:37.56
They love the sport.

622
00:26:37.56 --> 00:26:39.000
Now that was a two-time state champion.

623
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.88
I took fourth one as a sophomore.

624
00:26:40.88 --> 00:26:41.96
Do I, everyone's got,

625
00:26:41.96 --> 00:26:44.36
hey, yeah, you know, run around all the stadium

626
00:26:44.36 --> 00:26:46.04
and everybody's side-fiving me.

627
00:26:46.04 --> 00:26:48.12
I'm like, well, there's one down.

628
00:26:48.12 --> 00:26:49.28
Next year's the next year.

629
00:26:49.28 --> 00:26:51.64
And every son of a gun, I have to wrestle.

630
00:26:51.64 --> 00:26:53.000
I'm going to kick the shit out of everybody

631
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.08
until they know I'm there.

632
00:26:55.08 --> 00:26:58.36
And so that's the two things, right?

633
00:26:58.36 --> 00:27:03.36
Ego and heart and what you want, right?

634
00:27:04.60 --> 00:27:07.48
What do I do a lot of us winning the teams

635
00:27:07.48 --> 00:27:08.80
out of the ego thing?

636
00:27:08.80 --> 00:27:10.12
Those cats, they were the swimmers

637
00:27:10.12 --> 00:27:12.12
and all that kind of stuff.

638
00:27:12.12 --> 00:27:13.92
They were successful because they beat guys

639
00:27:13.92 --> 00:27:15.24
who were the same as them and they happen

640
00:27:15.24 --> 00:27:16.56
to have a little bit more talent.

641
00:27:16.56 --> 00:27:18.36
So they win.

642
00:27:18.36 --> 00:27:19.20
What was it?

643
00:27:19.20 --> 00:27:20.04
Ego is at heart.

644
00:27:21.40 --> 00:27:22.80
When you're a wrestler and you go out there

645
00:27:22.80 --> 00:27:25.04
and you're getting your ass beat every day,

646
00:27:25.04 --> 00:27:27.08
like I had so much respect for the kids

647
00:27:27.08 --> 00:27:28.96
that weren't as good as I was,

648
00:27:28.96 --> 00:27:31.48
but showed up for practice for me every day.

649
00:27:31.48 --> 00:27:33.08
And I'd make them hurt.

650
00:27:33.08 --> 00:27:35.64
I'd make them cry because that's where I was getting

651
00:27:35.64 --> 00:27:36.48
my stuff, right?

652
00:27:36.48 --> 00:27:39.12
My wrestling coach was a UDT guy, right?

653
00:27:39.12 --> 00:27:40.16
So what was his name?

654
00:27:40.16 --> 00:27:41.48
Harold Ashermbrenner.

655
00:27:41.48 --> 00:27:46.08
He helped start the museum in Fort Pierce.

656
00:27:46.08 --> 00:27:49.000
So was he a World War II guy or Korea guy?

657
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:49.84
Okay.

658
00:27:49.84 --> 00:27:52.48
In the gap of Korea and Vietnam, right?

659
00:27:52.48 --> 00:27:54.68
Actually, Russa Campbell who wrote the book,

660
00:27:54.68 --> 00:27:59.68
Russa Campbell's called Seal Team, was his instructor.

661
00:28:00.44 --> 00:28:02.76
He didn't even know how to swim either.

662
00:28:02.76 --> 00:28:05.88
He had to walk on the bottom of the pool, carry him rocks.

663
00:28:05.88 --> 00:28:07.36
Totally learned how to swim.

664
00:28:07.36 --> 00:28:08.80
That's the other thing about the teams.

665
00:28:08.80 --> 00:28:12.12
A lot of these guys didn't, they didn't swim well.

666
00:28:12.12 --> 00:28:14.48
They swam long, but they didn't swim well.

667
00:28:14.48 --> 00:28:15.56
There were other guys that could,

668
00:28:15.56 --> 00:28:17.96
I was the number one swim pair without fins.

669
00:28:17.96 --> 00:28:20.08
You put fins on me, I went to number 10.

670
00:28:20.08 --> 00:28:24.000
And those guys with big legs, shit, they kicked up

671
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.84
and they were number one.

672
00:28:24.84 --> 00:28:26.72
I'm out there freezing in the water.

673
00:28:26.72 --> 00:28:27.64
You know?

674
00:28:27.64 --> 00:28:28.96
But yeah.

675
00:28:28.96 --> 00:28:31.16
So you figured out about wrestling.

676
00:28:31.16 --> 00:28:34.72
And was there a wrestling team in seventh grade?

677
00:28:34.72 --> 00:28:35.76
You know, well, yeah.

678
00:28:35.76 --> 00:28:38.88
Okay, so you immediately or very soon after you,

679
00:28:38.88 --> 00:28:40.84
you started actually wrestling.

680
00:28:40.84 --> 00:28:42.64
Yeah, I actually started wrestling.

681
00:28:42.64 --> 00:28:44.40
And now you started to learn

682
00:28:44.40 --> 00:28:46.68
and you took to it really well, obviously.

683
00:28:46.68 --> 00:28:47.56
Yeah, I did.

684
00:28:47.56 --> 00:28:49.28
Yeah, and thinking of my brother,

685
00:28:49.28 --> 00:28:51.80
but there was always that thing, you know?

686
00:28:51.80 --> 00:28:54.24
And wait, what thing?

687
00:28:54.24 --> 00:28:55.72
The thing of I want to be able to protect myself,

688
00:28:55.72 --> 00:28:57.40
I want to be able to kick people's asses.

689
00:28:57.40 --> 00:28:59.40
And it was a little bit more ego driven.

690
00:28:59.40 --> 00:29:01.72
Survival.

691
00:29:01.72 --> 00:29:04.32
I was gonna say maybe just protection of,

692
00:29:04.32 --> 00:29:06.44
like you said, not wanting to bow,

693
00:29:06.44 --> 00:29:07.76
have to bow down to people.

694
00:29:07.76 --> 00:29:09.64
Right, yeah.

695
00:29:09.64 --> 00:29:13.44
So your brother had joined the Navy?

696
00:29:13.44 --> 00:29:14.84
And what year did he join the Navy?

697
00:29:14.84 --> 00:29:17.08
In 56.

698
00:29:17.08 --> 00:29:18.76
And on that wrestling, so he was on Boulder High

699
00:29:18.76 --> 00:29:20.32
wrestling team that I eventually went to,

700
00:29:20.32 --> 00:29:23.16
but he was kicking shit out of the doctor's son.

701
00:29:23.16 --> 00:29:24.84
So they said he had a heart murmur.

702
00:29:25.76 --> 00:29:27.76
And what they wouldn't let him wrestle?

703
00:29:27.76 --> 00:29:28.60
They wouldn't let him wrestle.

704
00:29:28.60 --> 00:29:31.12
But when my brother went into the Navy,

705
00:29:31.12 --> 00:29:32.32
he had no heart murmur.

706
00:29:32.32 --> 00:29:34.36
My brother was a corpsman.

707
00:29:34.36 --> 00:29:37.20
He finished up over here with SEAL team, right?

708
00:29:37.20 --> 00:29:41.16
And in Vietnam, he was working in Medevacs.

709
00:29:41.16 --> 00:29:42.80
A couple SEAL team guys got hit.

710
00:29:42.80 --> 00:29:45.24
I'm there at the same, we were both Vietnam at the same time,

711
00:29:45.24 --> 00:29:46.88
right in 69.

712
00:29:46.88 --> 00:29:51.88
And he was 67 or 68 and in part of 69.

713
00:29:52.24 --> 00:29:53.84
And he's sitting there checking all these guys out,

714
00:29:53.84 --> 00:29:54.96
you know, the helicopter bring him in.

715
00:29:54.96 --> 00:29:56.56
He said, I started looking at him.

716
00:29:56.56 --> 00:29:58.92
I couldn't tell anybody, I looked alike, right?

717
00:29:58.92 --> 00:30:00.44
He says, then I thought, what the hell am I doing?

718
00:30:00.44 --> 00:30:02.44
Looking at these, my brother's like this.

719
00:30:02.44 --> 00:30:07.12
He's a Kirby Hurrell, you know, he's a little guy.

720
00:30:07.12 --> 00:30:08.64
All these guys, you know, the guys,

721
00:30:08.64 --> 00:30:10.60
because it wasn't just the guys were wounded,

722
00:30:10.60 --> 00:30:13.20
but they actually did the extrication, right?

723
00:30:13.20 --> 00:30:15.20
So they just, they flew him out.

724
00:30:15.20 --> 00:30:17.40
So he was a corpsman in it, it got him.

725
00:30:17.40 --> 00:30:20.44
Did you, so did you, at what point did you

726
00:30:20.44 --> 00:30:22.84
start thinking about joining the Navy?

727
00:30:22.84 --> 00:30:25.60
Well, my brother went in the Navy.

728
00:30:25.60 --> 00:30:28.92
And so here I am, when I graduated,

729
00:30:28.92 --> 00:30:31.20
when I came back from Vietnam,

730
00:30:31.20 --> 00:30:32.88
I'd been back about 10 years,

731
00:30:32.88 --> 00:30:35.000
thought of Harold Ashenbrenner.

732
00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
So I called him up.

733
00:30:37.24 --> 00:30:40.48
Hey, do you remember, I was a 103 pound state champ, man.

734
00:30:40.48 --> 00:30:42.68
95 on 103 pounds.

735
00:30:42.68 --> 00:30:46.12
When I went in the teams, I weighed about 112 pounds, 115.

736
00:30:46.12 --> 00:30:46.96
A little.

737
00:30:46.96 --> 00:30:48.20
That's crazy.

738
00:30:48.20 --> 00:30:50.52
And there's still two guys littler than me,

739
00:30:50.52 --> 00:30:52.84
the Waller Wander brothers, they're in team two

740
00:30:52.84 --> 00:30:54.20
or something like that.

741
00:30:54.20 --> 00:30:57.36
And there was like Mike Walsh, he wrote a book.

742
00:30:57.36 --> 00:31:01.08
Mike Walsh is about like me, but he's,

743
00:31:01.08 --> 00:31:03.76
he's about like I am now when he went through.

744
00:31:03.76 --> 00:31:05.80
I weigh more than I did then.

745
00:31:05.80 --> 00:31:08.32
You were 112 pounds in buds.

746
00:31:08.32 --> 00:31:09.16
Yeah.

747
00:31:09.16 --> 00:31:10.52
That's freaking crazy.

748
00:31:10.52 --> 00:31:14.48
I was 120 pounds when I got burned in Vietnam

749
00:31:14.48 --> 00:31:17.20
after the water and all that stuff.

750
00:31:17.20 --> 00:31:20.20
Carrying 90 pounds of gear, trying to keep up with everybody.

751
00:31:20.20 --> 00:31:21.72
But I was selling them water.

752
00:31:22.96 --> 00:31:25.56
Because I drink water and they're sweating and stuff.

753
00:31:25.56 --> 00:31:26.60
You didn't need any water.

754
00:31:26.60 --> 00:31:29.32
I didn't need water and wrestlers don't need water.

755
00:31:29.32 --> 00:31:31.84
Then those days we, you know, we drank,

756
00:31:31.84 --> 00:31:33.16
if you didn't drink any water,

757
00:31:33.16 --> 00:31:35.40
and we took salt tablets, right, before practice.

758
00:31:35.40 --> 00:31:36.76
All this stuff to kill you, right?

759
00:31:36.76 --> 00:31:37.92
Yeah.

760
00:31:37.92 --> 00:31:39.76
So I had a big triangular water bath,

761
00:31:39.76 --> 00:31:42.60
you know, so I'd sit there and we'd be operating,

762
00:31:42.60 --> 00:31:43.44
ask me, you got some water?

763
00:31:43.44 --> 00:31:44.28
Yeah.

764
00:31:44.28 --> 00:31:46.16
And they were all outranked me.

765
00:31:46.16 --> 00:31:48.24
So I'd have them in the water and they'd take drinks

766
00:31:48.24 --> 00:31:49.16
and they'd count the swallows.

767
00:31:49.16 --> 00:31:52.08
One, two, three bucks, five bucks, 10 bucks.

768
00:31:53.84 --> 00:31:55.92
You know, so I'd make money on patrol.

769
00:31:55.92 --> 00:31:58.32
And then I'd borrow money from them

770
00:31:58.32 --> 00:32:00.56
because I didn't have any money when we were in Pennsylvania.

771
00:32:00.56 --> 00:32:02.32
It kind of balanced that, you know?

772
00:32:03.20 --> 00:32:05.96
But so you get to high school.

773
00:32:05.96 --> 00:32:07.88
Is, did you play any other sports besides?

774
00:32:07.88 --> 00:32:08.84
Cross country.

775
00:32:08.84 --> 00:32:10.000
Okay, so you were a good runner.

776
00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:10.84
I was a good runner.

777
00:32:10.84 --> 00:32:12.40
I was too light to play football

778
00:32:12.40 --> 00:32:13.68
on a late weight football team,

779
00:32:13.68 --> 00:32:15.52
but when we played in the green field,

780
00:32:15.52 --> 00:32:17.76
I mean, just no pads, no nothing.

781
00:32:17.76 --> 00:32:20.16
I was one of the fastest runners.

782
00:32:20.16 --> 00:32:23.28
And I'd hit you so hard I'd almost knocked myself out.

783
00:32:23.28 --> 00:32:25.52
So they didn't want to come around the corner of a guy.

784
00:32:25.52 --> 00:32:27.12
I don't want them to come past me.

785
00:32:27.12 --> 00:32:30.20
And we would have, we would play football

786
00:32:30.20 --> 00:32:33.08
and that football would eventually turn into a fight.

787
00:32:33.08 --> 00:32:34.44
You're gonna fight somebody, right?

788
00:32:34.44 --> 00:32:36.20
And they wouldn't with me too much

789
00:32:36.20 --> 00:32:38.56
because I was a good wrestler, you know?

790
00:32:38.56 --> 00:32:40.000
But, yeah.

791
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.80
Are you getting good grades?

792
00:32:41.80 --> 00:32:44.000
I was struggling with my grades.

793
00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
I didn't understand, and that's why when my kids,

794
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.52
when they're growing up, I says, how do you teach?

795
00:32:48.52 --> 00:32:51.84
Because I found I'm more of a hands-on learner, right?

796
00:32:51.84 --> 00:32:53.12
A visual learner.

797
00:32:53.12 --> 00:32:56.04
So concepts that I would get in my mind would be kind of hard.

798
00:32:56.04 --> 00:32:59.48
I found that out when I went through training.

799
00:32:59.48 --> 00:33:01.60
All the shit I needed, everything I needed to know,

800
00:33:01.60 --> 00:33:04.08
the dive physiology, anatomy and all that.

801
00:33:04.08 --> 00:33:05.76
I was kind of struggling with that, right?

802
00:33:05.76 --> 00:33:08.20
But I got it because I, it was the body, right?

803
00:33:08.20 --> 00:33:10.36
Triceps, biceps, heart and all that.

804
00:33:10.36 --> 00:33:12.60
That was, I dug that, right?

805
00:33:12.60 --> 00:33:14.88
But the demolitions, right?

806
00:33:14.88 --> 00:33:18.04
Mark 23, Mod 1, Bangler, torpedo, HBX,

807
00:33:18.04 --> 00:33:19.48
rate of fire is this and that.

808
00:33:19.48 --> 00:33:21.52
I'm going, oh shoot, took the first test.

809
00:33:21.52 --> 00:33:24.56
I already gone through, I already gone through Hell Week.

810
00:33:24.56 --> 00:33:26.56
I already went through dive phase.

811
00:33:26.56 --> 00:33:28.32
I already went through everything.

812
00:33:28.32 --> 00:33:31.48
Hell Week was a trip, but I learned that because,

813
00:33:31.48 --> 00:33:33.24
you know, Crawford?

814
00:33:34.16 --> 00:33:37.28
Okay, so I'm sitting there struggling.

815
00:33:37.28 --> 00:33:38.20
Senior class?

816
00:33:38.20 --> 00:33:39.24
Yeah, he's my class.

817
00:33:39.24 --> 00:33:40.32
Craw Daddy.

818
00:33:40.32 --> 00:33:42.84
Hey, we were in the same boat crew in Hell Week.

819
00:33:42.84 --> 00:33:44.80
He told me a story about Hell Week that I did,

820
00:33:44.80 --> 00:33:47.28
that I didn't know that I did, but he remembered that I didn't.

821
00:33:47.28 --> 00:33:48.88
He was my ex-so when I checked into team one.

822
00:33:48.88 --> 00:33:49.72
Oh really?

823
00:33:49.72 --> 00:33:50.56
Yup.

824
00:33:50.56 --> 00:33:51.40
I love him.

825
00:33:51.40 --> 00:33:52.84
I think I might even given him that name, Craw Dad.

826
00:33:52.84 --> 00:33:55.80
I even changed the other guys name from John to Jonah.

827
00:33:55.80 --> 00:33:58.20
But he still goes by Jonah.

828
00:33:58.20 --> 00:34:03.20
But yeah, I, he said, what's going on?

829
00:34:03.80 --> 00:34:05.80
I said, man, and I'm sad.

830
00:34:05.80 --> 00:34:08.04
Two guys died out there before.

831
00:34:08.04 --> 00:34:10.80
It's San Clemente in my training class, right?

832
00:34:10.80 --> 00:34:14.64
Are these the guys that drowned, get hung up on a,

833
00:34:14.64 --> 00:34:16.20
on a Japskoli?

834
00:34:16.20 --> 00:34:18.24
Yeah, Greckel McCall.

835
00:34:18.24 --> 00:34:19.40
So yeah, I said, what's going on?

836
00:34:19.40 --> 00:34:22.08
And he says, hey, they're gonna drop me.

837
00:34:22.08 --> 00:34:22.92
I said, why?

838
00:34:22.92 --> 00:34:25.68
So I can't, the demolition's dead.

839
00:34:25.68 --> 00:34:28.04
So he came over and just piece of paper,

840
00:34:28.04 --> 00:34:29.96
he says, okay, right down, man.

841
00:34:29.96 --> 00:34:31.48
And there was this old barracks, man.

842
00:34:31.48 --> 00:34:35.20
We had to, under a blanket with a flashlight.

843
00:34:35.20 --> 00:34:40.20
Mark 133, Mod 1, 133, Mod 2, Bangalore, Torpedo, H,

844
00:34:41.72 --> 00:34:44.88
all of the demolitions that we were gonna be tested on,

845
00:34:44.88 --> 00:34:47.56
I wrote them every night for a week,

846
00:34:47.56 --> 00:34:49.40
every night on a piece of paper.

847
00:34:49.40 --> 00:34:51.56
Said, that's what, that's what it's all about.

848
00:34:54.68 --> 00:34:55.84
I said, okay.

849
00:34:55.84 --> 00:34:57.80
And then what they were used for, right?

850
00:34:57.80 --> 00:34:59.52
So I go take my test.

851
00:34:59.52 --> 00:35:02.56
I said, okay, you guys got one hour to get your test done.

852
00:35:02.56 --> 00:35:03.68
So I grabbed my piece of paper

853
00:35:03.68 --> 00:35:05.28
and I start writing it out.

854
00:35:05.28 --> 00:35:07.68
Instructing it by Spinoza, he says, you got an hour.

855
00:35:07.68 --> 00:35:10.88
I said, I know, you got an hour.

856
00:35:10.88 --> 00:35:11.72
I said, I know.

857
00:35:13.36 --> 00:35:15.76
Just looking at the fucking, then he takes off, right?

858
00:35:15.76 --> 00:35:16.60
And I got it done.

859
00:35:16.60 --> 00:35:19.24
So then what I could do is I could take that paper,

860
00:35:19.24 --> 00:35:23.24
I could look at it, see the question, read the question,

861
00:35:23.24 --> 00:35:26.50
look at the answers, answers right there.

862
00:35:26.50 --> 00:35:29.08
But for me to get it, you know?

863
00:35:29.08 --> 00:35:30.16
And then when I went to college,

864
00:35:30.16 --> 00:35:33.08
you wanna, well, that's a whole another, that's later,

865
00:35:33.08 --> 00:35:38.08
but I didn't believe, I graduated with the 3.95.

866
00:35:38.24 --> 00:35:39.44
I wanted to be a teacher, right?

867
00:35:39.44 --> 00:35:41.24
But there's reasons I wasn't a teacher,

868
00:35:41.24 --> 00:35:45.76
but so I understood that was my way of learning.

869
00:35:45.76 --> 00:35:47.80
But it took, so in high school, you weren't doing great.

870
00:35:47.80 --> 00:35:48.88
No, no.

871
00:35:48.88 --> 00:35:51.12
But you graduated, what year did you graduate high school?

872
00:35:51.12 --> 00:35:56.12
The 66, 65, and then I went to Navy in 66.

873
00:35:56.72 --> 00:35:59.52
What'd you do in the, in between time?

874
00:35:59.52 --> 00:36:01.52
In between time, I had a wrestling scholarship

875
00:36:01.52 --> 00:36:03.16
at the University of Northern Colorado.

876
00:36:03.16 --> 00:36:04.08
Okay.

877
00:36:04.08 --> 00:36:06.28
So, well actually, Northeastern Junior College.

878
00:36:06.28 --> 00:36:07.56
So I was wrestling, right?

879
00:36:08.60 --> 00:36:12.08
I went home on break, walked into this bar,

880
00:36:12.08 --> 00:36:14.08
and one of the wrestlers that was one of my heroes,

881
00:36:14.08 --> 00:36:16.92
and he was Johnny Manzanera, it's from Lafayette.

882
00:36:16.92 --> 00:36:20.60
He was just, went to Junior College, he was a tough guy.

883
00:36:20.60 --> 00:36:24.24
So, but go back to Herald, right?

884
00:36:24.24 --> 00:36:25.08
Yes, we said-

885
00:36:25.08 --> 00:36:25.92
This was your UDT wrestling coach.

886
00:36:25.92 --> 00:36:28.40
Yeah, my UDT coach, he says, did you ever go into teams?

887
00:36:28.40 --> 00:36:30.04
I said, yeah, he says, do you remember what I asked you

888
00:36:30.04 --> 00:36:32.64
what you were gonna do when we were in the wrestling room?

889
00:36:32.64 --> 00:36:33.60
You know, like when you're wrestling,

890
00:36:33.60 --> 00:36:34.68
you all just kinda laying around.

891
00:36:34.68 --> 00:36:36.04
I said, no.

892
00:36:36.04 --> 00:36:38.36
He said, I asked you, what are you gonna do

893
00:36:38.36 --> 00:36:41.68
when you get out of high school?

894
00:36:41.68 --> 00:36:44.32
And you said, well, I go into the Navy.

895
00:36:44.32 --> 00:36:46.56
And then I asked you, coach asked me,

896
00:36:46.56 --> 00:36:49.24
what makes you think you're man enough to be a frogman?

897
00:36:49.24 --> 00:36:53.92
And I told him, coach, if you're man enough to be a frogman,

898
00:36:53.92 --> 00:36:55.92
I know I'm man enough to be a frogman.

899
00:36:55.92 --> 00:36:56.76
Damn.

900
00:36:56.76 --> 00:36:58.52
You're just one of those things, right?

901
00:36:58.52 --> 00:37:00.48
You're just one of those things.

902
00:37:00.48 --> 00:37:03.16
And so, yeah, I-

903
00:37:03.16 --> 00:37:05.92
So you said you were home on break

904
00:37:05.92 --> 00:37:07.56
from your wrestling scholarship.

905
00:37:07.56 --> 00:37:08.40
Yeah.

906
00:37:08.40 --> 00:37:09.88
And you said, did you even went to a bar?

907
00:37:09.88 --> 00:37:11.92
Went to a bar, it was called Grandma's Bar.

908
00:37:11.92 --> 00:37:13.20
And we all have to tell them,

909
00:37:13.20 --> 00:37:14.04
but where are you going?

910
00:37:14.04 --> 00:37:14.88
I'm going to Grandma's.

911
00:37:14.88 --> 00:37:16.92
They all thought we were going to Miss Toledo's house, right?

912
00:37:16.92 --> 00:37:19.80
We're all going to a bar sneaking in, 17 years old.

913
00:37:19.80 --> 00:37:23.08
But I was in college, right, as a freshman.

914
00:37:24.04 --> 00:37:27.04
Walked in and I see my buddy, Ronnie Manzaneras,

915
00:37:27.04 --> 00:37:28.68
saying, hey man, how you doing?

916
00:37:28.68 --> 00:37:31.12
From Lafayette, they used to go, wrestlers from Lewisville,

917
00:37:31.12 --> 00:37:33.04
Lafayette would go to Boulder and we'd wrestle,

918
00:37:33.04 --> 00:37:34.68
because we're all in three different leagues.

919
00:37:34.68 --> 00:37:36.80
And we'd prepare ourselves for the state tournament, right?

920
00:37:36.80 --> 00:37:39.24
Because we're all, and that's when we really knew

921
00:37:39.24 --> 00:37:40.32
that we were state champions,

922
00:37:40.32 --> 00:37:41.88
because we could whip those guys.

923
00:37:41.88 --> 00:37:44.16
And they were state champions, 1A and 2A.

924
00:37:44.16 --> 00:37:47.08
So I said, I'm the real champ, you know?

925
00:37:47.08 --> 00:37:49.36
And so, yeah, it was,

926
00:37:51.52 --> 00:37:52.52
how you doing, man?

927
00:37:52.52 --> 00:37:54.36
He says, start crying.

928
00:37:54.36 --> 00:37:55.84
I said, wait, what's up, man?

929
00:37:55.84 --> 00:37:57.16
You okay?

930
00:37:57.16 --> 00:37:59.24
He said, they killed my brother.

931
00:37:59.24 --> 00:38:00.52
I said, what?

932
00:38:00.52 --> 00:38:03.16
They killed Johnny, he's just a big red one, man.

933
00:38:03.16 --> 00:38:04.44
Small arms, you know.

934
00:38:07.16 --> 00:38:08.56
And they grabbed, there was the first time

935
00:38:08.56 --> 00:38:11.80
that I'd lost somebody from my family.

936
00:38:11.80 --> 00:38:15.60
From, you know, when you talk about family, it's just big.

937
00:38:15.60 --> 00:38:19.08
And from Lewisville, Lafayette, Latinos,

938
00:38:20.20 --> 00:38:22.24
and I hugged him and we cried.

939
00:38:22.24 --> 00:38:23.72
And then we sat down and,

940
00:38:23.72 --> 00:38:26.04
let me know what beer, I said, yeah, and pretty soon,

941
00:38:26.04 --> 00:38:28.84
he was telling the stories about his brother.

942
00:38:28.84 --> 00:38:31.76
And we were all laughing and crying and everything.

943
00:38:31.76 --> 00:38:33.52
So then I went, after Christmas break,

944
00:38:33.52 --> 00:38:35.08
I went back to school.

945
00:38:35.08 --> 00:38:36.92
And I was wrestling real well on it,

946
00:38:36.92 --> 00:38:38.72
I was doing real well.

947
00:38:39.76 --> 00:38:43.04
And when I went, it was just like I had to tell the coach,

948
00:38:43.04 --> 00:38:45.08
I said, I'm not coming back.

949
00:38:45.08 --> 00:38:45.92
He said, why not?

950
00:38:45.92 --> 00:38:47.16
I said, I can't.

951
00:38:47.16 --> 00:38:50.40
If you think about, I was raised when President Kennedy

952
00:38:50.40 --> 00:38:52.04
got assassinated, right?

953
00:38:52.04 --> 00:38:53.68
That's not what your country can do for you,

954
00:38:53.68 --> 00:38:55.52
but what you can do for your country.

955
00:38:55.52 --> 00:38:57.96
I always felt that my brother was serving in the military.

956
00:38:57.96 --> 00:39:01.20
My uncles were in World War II, right?

957
00:39:01.20 --> 00:39:03.08
My uncles that were in Korea.

958
00:39:03.08 --> 00:39:06.36
And we all served in the military.

959
00:39:07.28 --> 00:39:11.16
And so then it was like, what am I doing here?

960
00:39:12.48 --> 00:39:14.76
Wrestling, which wasn't real.

961
00:39:16.28 --> 00:39:19.24
Trying to get laid and my friends are dying.

962
00:39:19.24 --> 00:39:23.72
So I said, I'm joining the Navy,

963
00:39:23.72 --> 00:39:24.96
but there was the other side of that.

964
00:39:24.96 --> 00:39:26.48
My brother had gone around the world.

965
00:39:26.48 --> 00:39:28.12
I'm going, I wanna go around the world before,

966
00:39:28.12 --> 00:39:31.04
because I'd taken the test, you know, UDT,

967
00:39:31.04 --> 00:39:35.32
you know, in Buchan that I passed all that.

968
00:39:35.32 --> 00:39:38.52
But I wanted to, I wanted to party.

969
00:39:39.64 --> 00:39:41.32
Oh, I got stuck on a ship in a lung beat.

970
00:39:41.32 --> 00:39:43.76
That's where I got that, right?

971
00:39:43.76 --> 00:39:45.44
17, 18 years old.

972
00:39:45.44 --> 00:39:50.44
And so wait, so you get to boot camp?

973
00:39:51.48 --> 00:39:53.16
So get to boot camp.

974
00:39:53.16 --> 00:39:56.20
And you, so you had the plans of going into UDT?

975
00:39:56.20 --> 00:39:58.92
I had the thoughts about going UDT.

976
00:39:58.92 --> 00:40:00.92
Yeah, I wanted to be a frog man.

977
00:40:03.20 --> 00:40:04.56
Because of my wrestling coach,

978
00:40:04.56 --> 00:40:06.36
because he's talking about the cool shit, man,

979
00:40:06.36 --> 00:40:08.32
blowing stuff up and, you know,

980
00:40:08.32 --> 00:40:11.04
dropping pickup and jumping out of airplanes.

981
00:40:11.04 --> 00:40:13.32
And I'm going, whoa, that's,

982
00:40:13.32 --> 00:40:16.000
and then the one thing I like best of all of it, man,

983
00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.60
you get to wear aviator shades,

984
00:40:18.60 --> 00:40:19.92
work out, lay in the sun,

985
00:40:19.92 --> 00:40:23.16
and get to wear swimming trunks and chicks dig ya.

986
00:40:23.16 --> 00:40:25.72
So I'm going, oh, I could do that.

987
00:40:25.72 --> 00:40:28.56
I used to say, man, I used to be a 35 year old man

988
00:40:28.56 --> 00:40:29.80
and didn't put a sugar on at work,

989
00:40:29.80 --> 00:40:31.76
unless it was like inspection day, man.

990
00:40:31.76 --> 00:40:34.68
We just never, why, you know, pair of shorts.

991
00:40:34.68 --> 00:40:36.72
That's it, man, pair of shorts and jungle boots.

992
00:40:36.72 --> 00:40:38.08
Live in the dream.

993
00:40:38.08 --> 00:40:40.12
And we had a blue and gold, man.

994
00:40:40.12 --> 00:40:42.36
We had the original blue and golds.

995
00:40:42.36 --> 00:40:45.84
Guys would wear the blue and golds off duty.

996
00:40:45.84 --> 00:40:48.32
Then they'd say, you gotta be wearing lots of uniform, man.

997
00:40:48.32 --> 00:40:51.32
But we would wear whatever we wanted to wear, you know.

998
00:40:51.32 --> 00:40:54.68
So you take the screening test to go to Bud's?

999
00:40:54.68 --> 00:40:56.08
Yeah. In boot camp.

1000
00:40:56.08 --> 00:40:59.44
I took the test in, I was the only guy

1001
00:40:59.44 --> 00:41:00.88
out of my whole company that passed.

1002
00:41:00.88 --> 00:41:02.88
One other guy went with me, but he had false teeth,

1003
00:41:02.88 --> 00:41:03.72
so he about drowned.

1004
00:41:03.72 --> 00:41:05.28
He didn't make it.

1005
00:41:05.28 --> 00:41:09.72
So then when, so then when I really decided to do it,

1006
00:41:09.72 --> 00:41:10.80
cause I was on a ship, man,

1007
00:41:10.80 --> 00:41:13.60
I got tired of as a machinist mate.

1008
00:41:13.60 --> 00:41:16.80
Stinky, we did our sea trials and all that stuff

1009
00:41:16.80 --> 00:41:18.96
in the hole and everything like that.

1010
00:41:18.96 --> 00:41:22.96
But even then I was doing chin ups on the steam deals

1011
00:41:22.96 --> 00:41:23.92
and I was doing push ups.

1012
00:41:23.92 --> 00:41:28.92
I'd go work out by myself on, why are you doing that stuff?

1013
00:41:29.28 --> 00:41:30.68
Part of it was the wrestling thing.

1014
00:41:30.68 --> 00:41:32.52
Part of it is, right?

1015
00:41:32.52 --> 00:41:33.68
It's always there.

1016
00:41:33.68 --> 00:41:36.40
That's, that's a part of it was your brother

1017
00:41:36.40 --> 00:41:39.04
hanging you off of a door when you were four years old.

1018
00:41:39.04 --> 00:41:41.88
You pulled off some, there was part of that.

1019
00:41:41.88 --> 00:41:43.28
I mean, it's stuck, you know?

1020
00:41:43.28 --> 00:41:44.76
And, and, and if you think about it,

1021
00:41:44.76 --> 00:41:46.36
when you're doing that stuff,

1022
00:41:46.36 --> 00:41:50.12
that is the time that you're revealing yourself to yourself,

1023
00:41:50.12 --> 00:41:51.56
that that little boy, you always,

1024
00:41:51.56 --> 00:41:53.96
and when I'm doing that, even now,

1025
00:41:53.96 --> 00:41:57.04
what worked out over, over the amphibes,

1026
00:41:58.64 --> 00:42:01.48
I can, I can, I, I, I feel the young boy.

1027
00:42:01.48 --> 00:42:03.32
I feel the little boy coming up.

1028
00:42:03.32 --> 00:42:05.84
I feel that, that spirit of peace that I have,

1029
00:42:05.84 --> 00:42:08.04
that is young and that is strong.

1030
00:42:08.04 --> 00:42:10.40
Even, even when I got a jacked up shoulder,

1031
00:42:10.40 --> 00:42:12.24
I got a left knee replacement, my ankle,

1032
00:42:12.24 --> 00:42:14.08
I'm looking at that, you know?

1033
00:42:14.08 --> 00:42:17.84
It's, and so, yeah, it was,

1034
00:42:20.72 --> 00:42:24.04
it was, I was looking out the end of that ship

1035
00:42:24.04 --> 00:42:25.64
and here come these guys swimming by

1036
00:42:25.64 --> 00:42:27.28
cause I'm sitting on that ship, seeing what the,

1037
00:42:27.28 --> 00:42:28.68
Where was that ship stationed?

1038
00:42:28.68 --> 00:42:30.32
Well, it was stationed on Long Beach.

1039
00:42:30.32 --> 00:42:31.16
Okay, so you were in Long Beach.

1040
00:42:31.16 --> 00:42:33.04
But we did sea trials and we pulled into San Diego.

1041
00:42:33.04 --> 00:42:33.88
God.

1042
00:42:33.88 --> 00:42:35.80
So we're over on 36, over by the bay,

1043
00:42:35.80 --> 00:42:38.16
when guys used to do the training in the bay.

1044
00:42:38.16 --> 00:42:40.000
And I'm sitting looking out there and stinky

1045
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.40
and everything, we had to help the board them

1046
00:42:41.40 --> 00:42:43.12
and blow the tubes so we're all black.

1047
00:42:43.12 --> 00:42:45.80
And I looked and here come these guys swimming by.

1048
00:42:46.80 --> 00:42:48.56
You know, they're heading to a keg too.

1049
00:42:48.56 --> 00:42:49.40
Yeah.

1050
00:42:49.40 --> 00:42:50.56
Who are those guys?

1051
00:42:50.56 --> 00:42:52.80
You know, all those UDT guys, I'm like,

1052
00:42:52.80 --> 00:42:54.16
oh, hell with this.

1053
00:42:54.16 --> 00:42:55.36
So I put in for it and it might,

1054
00:42:55.36 --> 00:42:57.32
XO went, let me go cause I'm too little.

1055
00:42:57.32 --> 00:42:59.64
Or you're too little, you'll never make it.

1056
00:42:59.64 --> 00:43:02.08
God, I hated that, I hated that sabotaging belief

1057
00:43:02.08 --> 00:43:03.76
from the time I was a kid.

1058
00:43:03.76 --> 00:43:06.36
You're too small, right? You're too dark.

1059
00:43:06.36 --> 00:43:08.20
Even when I was wrestling in high school,

1060
00:43:08.20 --> 00:43:10.76
my wrestling coach took a team to Japan.

1061
00:43:10.76 --> 00:43:11.96
I was a two time state champ.

1062
00:43:11.96 --> 00:43:14.72
They didn't take me or a guy named Joe Silva, right?

1063
00:43:14.72 --> 00:43:17.80
And I said, well, why? What's the deal?

1064
00:43:17.80 --> 00:43:19.80
Well, Gil, you really don't look like

1065
00:43:19.80 --> 00:43:22.20
what the Japanese think Americans look like.

1066
00:43:23.96 --> 00:43:25.56
I'm like, huh?

1067
00:43:25.56 --> 00:43:27.44
I didn't understand that, right?

1068
00:43:27.44 --> 00:43:28.96
What?

1069
00:43:28.96 --> 00:43:31.64
And so the sabotaging belief like that, right?

1070
00:43:31.64 --> 00:43:33.28
Is it ego or what is it?

1071
00:43:33.28 --> 00:43:35.68
But it is something that says, uh-uh.

1072
00:43:35.68 --> 00:43:37.28
You're not gonna make me beat up somebody.

1073
00:43:37.28 --> 00:43:39.36
You're not gonna make me do those things.

1074
00:43:39.36 --> 00:43:42.52
Because that little boy that's in there knows who he is.

1075
00:43:42.52 --> 00:43:44.60
Right? It's being revealed.

1076
00:43:44.60 --> 00:43:45.44
It's being revealed.

1077
00:43:45.44 --> 00:43:49.64
That was part of that pain of hearing that was revealing.

1078
00:43:49.64 --> 00:43:50.48
Right?

1079
00:43:50.48 --> 00:43:51.68
So I'm looking at these guys,

1080
00:43:51.68 --> 00:43:53.24
so I'm gonna do that.

1081
00:43:53.24 --> 00:43:55.44
And that coach, I mean, the XO said,

1082
00:43:55.44 --> 00:43:57.04
you're too little or whatever.

1083
00:43:57.04 --> 00:44:00.000
Next thing you know, there I am over at the training.

1084
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.60
But I had to do this.

1085
00:44:02.60 --> 00:44:03.44
They took us, they says,

1086
00:44:03.44 --> 00:44:05.76
once you go down to a hyperbaric chamber test,

1087
00:44:05.76 --> 00:44:08.16
it's okay, I did that in Long Beach.

1088
00:44:08.16 --> 00:44:11.40
Do the PT test again, the run, the swim and all that stuff.

1089
00:44:11.40 --> 00:44:13.96
And then we want you to go down to the tugboat.

1090
00:44:13.96 --> 00:44:17.48
And now there's a diver down there, class A diver.

1091
00:44:17.48 --> 00:44:19.20
That's all right, so I go down there.

1092
00:44:19.20 --> 00:44:20.68
And there's a chief.

1093
00:44:20.68 --> 00:44:22.76
No, those old chiefs, the diver chiefs, right?

1094
00:44:22.76 --> 00:44:24.08
The hard-hand helmet.

1095
00:44:24.08 --> 00:44:24.92
What you doing, kid?

1096
00:44:24.92 --> 00:44:25.76
I said, I don't know.

1097
00:44:25.76 --> 00:44:26.64
They told me to come down.

1098
00:44:26.64 --> 00:44:27.96
I wanna go on UDT.

1099
00:44:29.20 --> 00:44:30.20
Oh yeah, come on over here.

1100
00:44:30.20 --> 00:44:31.04
Sit down.

1101
00:44:31.04 --> 00:44:33.72
Put that, the big old boots, right?

1102
00:44:33.72 --> 00:44:34.72
The big old heavy boots.

1103
00:44:34.72 --> 00:44:35.92
And they folded all the,

1104
00:44:37.92 --> 00:44:39.000
was the class one dive suit.

1105
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.56
Yeah, the old school dive suit.

1106
00:44:40.56 --> 00:44:42.12
Whatever they call it, you know.

1107
00:44:42.12 --> 00:44:43.72
And then they put the helmet on me.

1108
00:44:43.72 --> 00:44:45.36
I'm sitting like this.

1109
00:44:46.40 --> 00:44:48.16
I go over there, go to the ladder, go down.

1110
00:44:48.16 --> 00:44:49.84
He says, and just walk around down there.

1111
00:44:49.84 --> 00:44:51.20
There's some eels over by some rock.

1112
00:44:51.20 --> 00:44:52.36
Just kind of make yourself at home.

1113
00:44:52.36 --> 00:44:54.24
And we'll talk to you, check you out.

1114
00:44:54.24 --> 00:44:55.08
I said, oh.

1115
00:44:55.08 --> 00:44:56.88
This was your first dive ever?

1116
00:44:56.88 --> 00:44:59.76
Ever, for somebody I've ever been underwater.

1117
00:44:59.76 --> 00:45:01.24
I didn't know anything.

1118
00:45:01.24 --> 00:45:03.52
So I go down and he's like, how you doing now?

1119
00:45:03.52 --> 00:45:04.76
And I said, well, I'm doing fine.

1120
00:45:04.76 --> 00:45:06.60
He says, everything good?

1121
00:45:06.60 --> 00:45:07.44
I said, yeah.

1122
00:45:07.44 --> 00:45:09.84
So, you know, there's a water coming in my left leg, you know.

1123
00:45:09.84 --> 00:45:10.92
Oh yeah, don't worry about it.

1124
00:45:10.92 --> 00:45:12.48
It says, water will come in your left leg.

1125
00:45:12.48 --> 00:45:13.72
I said, all right.

1126
00:45:13.72 --> 00:45:15.96
He says, let us know if it goes into your right leg.

1127
00:45:15.96 --> 00:45:17.60
So a little bit, I'm still walking around.

1128
00:45:17.60 --> 00:45:18.88
It was 15 minutes, right?

1129
00:45:18.88 --> 00:45:20.40
So I'm walking around and he goes in my left leg.

1130
00:45:20.40 --> 00:45:22.20
I'm in my right leg and I'm going,

1131
00:45:22.20 --> 00:45:25.72
hey, you know this, so, this, this suit's leaking.

1132
00:45:25.72 --> 00:45:26.60
Yeah, okay, we know it.

1133
00:45:26.60 --> 00:45:27.44
Don't worry about it.

1134
00:45:27.44 --> 00:45:29.000
Let us know if the water gets up to your chest.

1135
00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.36
I didn't know anything about pressure, right?

1136
00:45:31.36 --> 00:45:33.48
The pressure in the helmet's not going to go any deeper.

1137
00:45:33.48 --> 00:45:37.44
I'm going, I said, hey, you know, the water's up on my neck.

1138
00:45:37.44 --> 00:45:38.68
Nothing.

1139
00:45:38.68 --> 00:45:42.84
Nobody talks about, hey, the water is up to my neck.

1140
00:45:42.84 --> 00:45:45.68
Maybe you guys might think about pulling me up.

1141
00:45:45.68 --> 00:45:46.52
Nothing.

1142
00:45:47.68 --> 00:45:52.12
So then it was like, I'm going to die.

1143
00:45:52.12 --> 00:45:53.48
So I went over to some rocks.

1144
00:45:53.48 --> 00:45:55.44
I laid back on the rocks and I reached back.

1145
00:45:55.44 --> 00:45:57.40
I thought, well, if I can grab the ropes,

1146
00:45:57.40 --> 00:45:59.92
if I can grab the hose, I'll pull myself up.

1147
00:45:59.92 --> 00:46:03.28
But they had it tended, so there's no way I could,

1148
00:46:03.28 --> 00:46:04.12
I could reach it.

1149
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.76
So in my mind, Hail Mary full of grace,

1150
00:46:07.76 --> 00:46:10.12
the Lord is with thee, I'm going to die.

1151
00:46:10.12 --> 00:46:12.72
And then the next thing is, it's quiet.

1152
00:46:12.72 --> 00:46:14.28
I didn't, I didn't pray it out loud.

1153
00:46:14.28 --> 00:46:15.80
He pulled me up.

1154
00:46:15.80 --> 00:46:17.24
Yeah, you pass kid.

1155
00:46:17.24 --> 00:46:19.12
So about three days later,

1156
00:46:19.12 --> 00:46:22.36
and then it already had my orders and I show up at the area.

1157
00:46:22.36 --> 00:46:24.60
So show up the area and I look at guys like Echo

1158
00:46:24.60 --> 00:46:27.68
and look at guys like Jaco,

1159
00:46:27.68 --> 00:46:30.60
I'm going the same question like, what the,

1160
00:46:30.60 --> 00:46:32.24
what am I doing here?

1161
00:46:32.24 --> 00:46:33.08
Right?

1162
00:46:33.08 --> 00:46:34.48
I'm just a little guy.

1163
00:46:34.48 --> 00:46:37.36
I'm walking around here and I saw another guy,

1164
00:46:37.36 --> 00:46:39.68
Latino Gregor Ligar, see I looked at him and he said,

1165
00:46:39.68 --> 00:46:40.72
hey man, how you doing?

1166
00:46:40.72 --> 00:46:43.000
He says, two little guys.

1167
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.04
Good, where you from man?

1168
00:46:44.04 --> 00:46:46.28
Some from Fresno, some from Colorado.

1169
00:46:46.28 --> 00:46:47.28
He goes, you speak Spanish?

1170
00:46:47.28 --> 00:46:49.36
He said, no, me neither.

1171
00:46:49.36 --> 00:46:52.28
It's just, we're like, you know, but we're the only two.

1172
00:46:52.28 --> 00:46:54.72
And that was in 41, right?

1173
00:46:54.72 --> 00:46:56.04
And so we've been getting-

1174
00:46:56.04 --> 00:46:58.000
So you're 112 pounds.

1175
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:58.84
Yeah.

1176
00:46:58.84 --> 00:46:59.68
That's freaking crazy.

1177
00:46:59.68 --> 00:47:01.84
Well give me the advantage, 120 pounds.

1178
00:47:01.84 --> 00:47:03.20
Even 120, man.

1179
00:47:03.20 --> 00:47:04.88
Cause I'm just, there's so much physical stuff

1180
00:47:04.88 --> 00:47:06.92
they have to do with like carrying logs, carrying boats.

1181
00:47:06.92 --> 00:47:08.24
Like, that's-

1182
00:47:08.24 --> 00:47:09.52
And so people would sit there and say,

1183
00:47:09.52 --> 00:47:11.60
like I was under the boat for a while.

1184
00:47:11.60 --> 00:47:13.08
And then they go, you two little guys,

1185
00:47:13.08 --> 00:47:15.40
me and Gregor Ligar are gonna see you, we're in front, right?

1186
00:47:15.40 --> 00:47:17.04
And then they got two medium sized guys

1187
00:47:17.04 --> 00:47:18.36
and then there's two tall guys.

1188
00:47:18.36 --> 00:47:20.12
So our boat was like this.

1189
00:47:20.12 --> 00:47:22.04
So going up Mount Serobachi was cool

1190
00:47:22.04 --> 00:47:24.000
because it stays level.

1191
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
But when you come down the other side,

1192
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.20
the first three times it wasn't good because we would crash.

1193
00:47:30.20 --> 00:47:32.52
And then we was like, man, we really gotta run fast.

1194
00:47:32.52 --> 00:47:34.84
I mean, we just, it was sprinting down hill

1195
00:47:34.84 --> 00:47:37.12
in order for us to make it, you know?

1196
00:47:37.12 --> 00:47:37.96
So there was a disadvantage.

1197
00:47:37.96 --> 00:47:39.60
So what's your introduction to Bud's like?

1198
00:47:39.60 --> 00:47:42.36
Or it's UDT trade.

1199
00:47:42.36 --> 00:47:43.20
How do you guys say that?

1200
00:47:43.20 --> 00:47:44.20
UDTRA.

1201
00:47:44.20 --> 00:47:46.000
UDTRA.

1202
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.40
What was your introduction?

1203
00:47:48.96 --> 00:47:49.80
When I first got there?

1204
00:47:49.80 --> 00:47:51.56
Yeah, like you got there.

1205
00:47:51.56 --> 00:47:52.72
But when I first got there,

1206
00:47:52.72 --> 00:47:54.64
is everybody just kind of wandered around.

1207
00:47:54.64 --> 00:47:58.16
You know, we'd like, this was in 41, right?

1208
00:47:58.16 --> 00:47:59.000
In 41.

1209
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.12
This is class 41.

1210
00:48:00.12 --> 00:48:01.68
Class 41.

1211
00:48:01.68 --> 00:48:03.36
And this is gonna share something with you

1212
00:48:03.36 --> 00:48:05.88
that was really painful for me in 41.

1213
00:48:05.88 --> 00:48:10.88
And so there's another little guy, his big mouth, man.

1214
00:48:11.56 --> 00:48:13.80
Another guy, and then there's another guy, black cat.

1215
00:48:15.04 --> 00:48:15.88
Beautiful.

1216
00:48:15.88 --> 00:48:19.12
Man, look at him going, Jesus, cramity, man.

1217
00:48:19.12 --> 00:48:22.16
And there was another little guy, Mel Tanaka, he graduated.

1218
00:48:22.16 --> 00:48:23.52
He's a team's.

1219
00:48:25.52 --> 00:48:29.36
And Artie Reese, I don't know if you've ever heard of him.

1220
00:48:29.36 --> 00:48:31.36
He's another little guy.

1221
00:48:31.36 --> 00:48:32.28
And so...

1222
00:48:33.48 --> 00:48:34.80
You guys had a little mafia.

1223
00:48:34.80 --> 00:48:36.08
Little guy mafia.

1224
00:48:36.08 --> 00:48:37.08
There were little guys.

1225
00:48:37.08 --> 00:48:40.28
But they all weighed me by about 10 pounds, 15 pounds.

1226
00:48:40.28 --> 00:48:49.28
But it was, I didn't have any focus.

1227
00:48:50.68 --> 00:48:53.08
I was just along for the ride,

1228
00:48:53.08 --> 00:48:55.40
doing whatever they were gonna do.

1229
00:48:55.40 --> 00:49:00.40
And so it was like, there was no like this prep stuff.

1230
00:49:00.88 --> 00:49:02.60
It was like, we got there for one week,

1231
00:49:02.60 --> 00:49:04.08
everybody kind of got to know each other.

1232
00:49:04.08 --> 00:49:06.32
The second week, we're running.

1233
00:49:06.32 --> 00:49:08.72
We're in class, we're in training.

1234
00:49:08.72 --> 00:49:11.36
And we're doing all that whole physical thing,

1235
00:49:11.36 --> 00:49:13.80
getting us ready for Hell Week, right?

1236
00:49:13.80 --> 00:49:18.04
And so during Hell Week, it was the last day of Hell Week

1237
00:49:18.04 --> 00:49:18.88
before you secure.

1238
00:49:18.88 --> 00:49:19.80
It's a Friday afternoon.

1239
00:49:19.80 --> 00:49:22.000
It was a Saturday, they secure, right?

1240
00:49:23.04 --> 00:49:24.60
I think they secured on Saturday.

1241
00:49:24.60 --> 00:49:26.28
When Hell Week is over, you mean?

1242
00:49:26.28 --> 00:49:27.12
Yeah.

1243
00:49:27.12 --> 00:49:28.84
It's been Friday and it's been Saturday,

1244
00:49:28.84 --> 00:49:30.36
depending on like what era?

1245
00:49:30.36 --> 00:49:31.64
Well, it was Friday.

1246
00:49:31.64 --> 00:49:35.04
And then that Friday night, they do a paddle,

1247
00:49:35.04 --> 00:49:37.36
and then they secure Sunday, right?

1248
00:49:37.36 --> 00:49:40.48
So that we were doing a swim.

1249
00:49:40.48 --> 00:49:41.64
So this is in Hell Week?

1250
00:49:41.64 --> 00:49:42.68
This is in Hell Week.

1251
00:49:42.68 --> 00:49:43.52
Okay.

1252
00:49:43.52 --> 00:49:44.34
We were doing a swim.

1253
00:49:46.92 --> 00:49:50.52
Down and back, down and back.

1254
00:49:50.52 --> 00:49:52.68
And when I got, me and Greg Grigory Lee got out,

1255
00:49:52.68 --> 00:49:54.28
we got, these guys are getting out of the water.

1256
00:49:54.28 --> 00:49:55.32
I said, all right.

1257
00:49:55.32 --> 00:49:57.44
So I'm glad too, cause it was cold.

1258
00:49:57.44 --> 00:49:58.40
We get out of the water,

1259
00:49:58.40 --> 00:50:01.56
when we get out of the water, they're chief Allen.

1260
00:50:01.56 --> 00:50:04.56
He says, okay, if and quitters over here.

1261
00:50:04.56 --> 00:50:06.56
And I'm like, well, I didn't quit.

1262
00:50:06.56 --> 00:50:07.48
He says, you're out of the water.

1263
00:50:07.48 --> 00:50:08.32
I just, yeah.

1264
00:50:08.32 --> 00:50:09.16
He said, get back in the water.

1265
00:50:09.16 --> 00:50:11.76
By that time, I was cramped up.

1266
00:50:11.76 --> 00:50:13.44
There were like about 60 guys got out.

1267
00:50:13.44 --> 00:50:15.64
I mean, almost the whole class got out.

1268
00:50:16.80 --> 00:50:19.52
And so I said, well, I didn't quit.

1269
00:50:19.52 --> 00:50:20.36
He says, get in the water.

1270
00:50:20.36 --> 00:50:23.78
And I went, I couldn't, I didn't know that if I'd got back

1271
00:50:23.78 --> 00:50:26.52
in the water, that I would have felt warm.

1272
00:50:27.84 --> 00:50:29.04
I didn't know that.

1273
00:50:29.04 --> 00:50:30.92
So I went with everybody else.

1274
00:50:30.92 --> 00:50:33.72
So that night, that was Saturday night,

1275
00:50:33.72 --> 00:50:35.92
I could see them coming around for the last paddle.

1276
00:50:35.92 --> 00:50:37.44
And I looked out the back window

1277
00:50:38.56 --> 00:50:39.72
and I just start crying.

1278
00:50:40.84 --> 00:50:42.56
I said, I didn't quit, man.

1279
00:50:42.56 --> 00:50:45.20
So I went back to the instructor's check.

1280
00:50:45.20 --> 00:50:46.56
And there was no bell.

1281
00:50:46.56 --> 00:50:49.48
It was on the door.

1282
00:50:49.48 --> 00:50:51.64
Espinosa reported, anyone speak to you chief?

1283
00:50:51.64 --> 00:50:52.48
Chief Allen.

1284
00:50:53.26 --> 00:50:55.84
And so what do you want Espinosa?

1285
00:50:55.84 --> 00:50:57.64
I said, chief, I didn't quit.

1286
00:50:57.64 --> 00:51:00.92
I said, got out with everybody, but I didn't quit.

1287
00:51:00.92 --> 00:51:02.20
I says, you fucking quit.

1288
00:51:02.20 --> 00:51:04.04
I said, I didn't quit.

1289
00:51:04.04 --> 00:51:04.92
I said, I won't back in.

1290
00:51:04.92 --> 00:51:07.12
He says, you can't get back in.

1291
00:51:07.12 --> 00:51:08.56
I said, I gotta get back in.

1292
00:51:09.88 --> 00:51:11.000
He said, I'm gonna tell you this.

1293
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.60
He says, there's only one way that you may have a chance.

1294
00:51:13.60 --> 00:51:15.56
He says, you gotta go talk to the captain,

1295
00:51:15.56 --> 00:51:18.60
Captain Myers, command, all I am, Fibbase, right?

1296
00:51:18.60 --> 00:51:20.80
If the whole command and talk to him,

1297
00:51:20.80 --> 00:51:22.000
maybe you might have a chance.

1298
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.04
He's by doubt.

1299
00:51:23.04 --> 00:51:25.64
So what day of hell week was this?

1300
00:51:25.64 --> 00:51:27.76
It was the last day of hell week.

1301
00:51:27.76 --> 00:51:28.88
We'd already gone through hell week.

1302
00:51:28.88 --> 00:51:31.36
We've already gone through all the rolling around

1303
00:51:31.36 --> 00:51:32.20
and all that bullshit.

1304
00:51:32.20 --> 00:51:34.16
So you're done with five days of hell week?

1305
00:51:34.16 --> 00:51:36.84
We were in the sixth day of hell week.

1306
00:51:36.84 --> 00:51:38.68
So it's pretty much over?

1307
00:51:38.68 --> 00:51:39.52
It's pretty much over.

1308
00:51:39.52 --> 00:51:40.88
It was the last evolution.

1309
00:51:40.88 --> 00:51:42.48
It was the swim.

1310
00:51:42.48 --> 00:51:45.16
And then we get in boats and then we paddle.

1311
00:51:45.16 --> 00:51:46.000
Right?

1312
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.88
It was late in the afternoon, probably about five

1313
00:51:47.88 --> 00:51:49.76
or six o'clock at night.

1314
00:51:49.76 --> 00:51:53.60
Just like out here, starts, the sun starts coming down.

1315
00:51:53.60 --> 00:51:57.000
So you guys finished the swim?

1316
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000
Well, those guys that finished the swim,

1317
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.48
those guys that were with me that I was with, we were out.

1318
00:52:02.48 --> 00:52:05.44
We're all quitters, right?

1319
00:52:05.44 --> 00:52:09.64
I couldn't, I said, I didn't quit in here, right?

1320
00:52:09.64 --> 00:52:12.44
So I went and I told you, I said, I didn't quit.

1321
00:52:12.44 --> 00:52:14.72
He still was doing, he says, get the fuck out of here.

1322
00:52:16.04 --> 00:52:20.24
So I went back to the barracks and I was broken, man,

1323
00:52:20.24 --> 00:52:22.44
because I wanted to be a frog man.

1324
00:52:22.44 --> 00:52:25.76
And so the next, that was a, that was Saturday morning,

1325
00:52:25.76 --> 00:52:28.12
Sunday came and all the guys in the class

1326
00:52:28.12 --> 00:52:31.08
were barely walking and they're sitting there looking at me,

1327
00:52:31.08 --> 00:52:35.12
you know, and I'm looking at them and like,

1328
00:52:35.12 --> 00:52:38.48
and I'm sure they were saying, I fucking quit her, you know?

1329
00:52:38.48 --> 00:52:42.24
And I don't really want to say that word, but that,

1330
00:52:42.24 --> 00:52:47.08
so that next day I put on my dress blues, man.

1331
00:52:47.08 --> 00:52:49.04
I go to, so guys say, hey, Espy, where you going?

1332
00:52:49.04 --> 00:52:51.24
I said, I'm getting back into training.

1333
00:52:51.24 --> 00:52:54.64
So I went, got breakfast, went over to the,

1334
00:52:54.64 --> 00:52:58.60
that knock on the door, oh well, we go in

1335
00:52:58.60 --> 00:53:01.92
and these other guys say, we'll go with you, right?

1336
00:53:01.92 --> 00:53:04.52
About 20 guys go with me.

1337
00:53:04.52 --> 00:53:06.16
Crothead knows this story.

1338
00:53:06.16 --> 00:53:07.56
20 guys go with me.

1339
00:53:07.56 --> 00:53:08.92
These are guys from your class?

1340
00:53:08.92 --> 00:53:10.52
The guys that had made it.

1341
00:53:10.52 --> 00:53:11.60
No, that had quit.

1342
00:53:11.60 --> 00:53:12.44
Okay.

1343
00:53:12.44 --> 00:53:13.68
All the quitters, right?

1344
00:53:13.68 --> 00:53:17.12
All the guys that had made it to that pace of hell week

1345
00:53:17.12 --> 00:53:19.92
and there were even some guys in 41 that quit after hell week.

1346
00:53:19.92 --> 00:53:21.28
And so forget it.

1347
00:53:21.28 --> 00:53:24.36
See people, it's just the training, man.

1348
00:53:24.36 --> 00:53:26.08
It's not the real world ops.

1349
00:53:26.08 --> 00:53:28.20
So when people talk about, oh, going to frog man,

1350
00:53:28.20 --> 00:53:31.60
and oh yeah, I'm a, I did hell week and all that bullshit.

1351
00:53:31.60 --> 00:53:34.56
But you go, then you still got to do world ops.

1352
00:53:34.56 --> 00:53:35.76
That's, that's what they don't,

1353
00:53:35.76 --> 00:53:36.92
that's what they don't tell you about.

1354
00:53:36.92 --> 00:53:37.76
That's what you don't see.

1355
00:53:37.76 --> 00:53:40.80
That's what the hero bullshit is bullshit.

1356
00:53:40.80 --> 00:53:43.80
But when you get out like Roger Hayden does a trip with UDT,

1357
00:53:43.80 --> 00:53:45.72
gets shot, gets a bronze star from there.

1358
00:53:45.72 --> 00:53:48.72
Then he goes to SEAL team and they look at him and say,

1359
00:53:48.72 --> 00:53:49.84
hey, new guy, huh?

1360
00:53:51.84 --> 00:53:54.36
He's like, because when I met him, he was,

1361
00:53:54.36 --> 00:53:56.32
those sons of bitches in SEALs, he said,

1362
00:53:56.32 --> 00:53:58.12
they sit there because I'm a UDT guy.

1363
00:53:58.12 --> 00:53:59.92
I didn't do anything.

1364
00:53:59.92 --> 00:54:02.88
And you know, and you know, Roger, so he's the son.

1365
00:54:02.88 --> 00:54:04.80
You had to have some big balls to call Roger Hayden,

1366
00:54:04.80 --> 00:54:05.64
new guy.

1367
00:54:05.64 --> 00:54:06.68
Yeah, he was a new guy.

1368
00:54:06.68 --> 00:54:07.52
Well, he was.

1369
00:54:07.52 --> 00:54:08.52
He was a new guy.

1370
00:54:08.52 --> 00:54:10.48
I'll tell you something more about that later on.

1371
00:54:10.48 --> 00:54:14.92
But so I'm in there, Kaepernick walks in.

1372
00:54:14.92 --> 00:54:16.92
So did these 20 guys that came with you,

1373
00:54:16.92 --> 00:54:18.76
did they also want to get back into training?

1374
00:54:18.76 --> 00:54:19.88
Yes.

1375
00:54:19.88 --> 00:54:21.56
So they all come with me, right?

1376
00:54:22.56 --> 00:54:26.56
Skipper walks in, we're waiting, told them,

1377
00:54:26.56 --> 00:54:28.48
you know what we wanted?

1378
00:54:28.48 --> 00:54:32.56
He goes back out the one day for five days.

1379
00:54:32.56 --> 00:54:35.24
He never talked to us, never acknowledged us, nothing.

1380
00:54:35.24 --> 00:54:38.60
So from 20 to 30 guys, people said,

1381
00:54:38.60 --> 00:54:40.32
fuck it, they ain't doing this.

1382
00:54:40.32 --> 00:54:41.84
They're gone, right?

1383
00:54:42.80 --> 00:54:46.16
At the end of the end of that week, there were six of us.

1384
00:54:46.16 --> 00:54:51.32
Me, Schellenberger, Moe, Steele, Garcia, right?

1385
00:54:51.32 --> 00:54:52.76
And McGee.

1386
00:54:52.76 --> 00:54:57.76
So the next week, that Friday, he had us come in.

1387
00:54:59.16 --> 00:55:01.08
We came in, he said, what do you want?

1388
00:55:01.08 --> 00:55:04.76
I said, I looked at the guys, I looked at them and said,

1389
00:55:04.76 --> 00:55:06.40
I didn't quit.

1390
00:55:06.40 --> 00:55:07.64
So what about you guys?

1391
00:55:07.64 --> 00:55:09.40
And they just looked at me and was like,

1392
00:55:10.56 --> 00:55:12.72
I didn't quit either, right?

1393
00:55:12.72 --> 00:55:13.88
Six of us.

1394
00:55:13.88 --> 00:55:16.68
Says, well, we wanted to get back into the next class.

1395
00:55:18.24 --> 00:55:19.76
Get out of my office.

1396
00:55:19.76 --> 00:55:20.60
So we leave.

1397
00:55:20.60 --> 00:55:21.60
Weekend.

1398
00:55:21.60 --> 00:55:24.52
So the next week, I show up with the guys,

1399
00:55:24.52 --> 00:55:27.48
we'll be doing this, because we're going back.

1400
00:55:27.48 --> 00:55:29.28
So we go back Monday.

1401
00:55:29.28 --> 00:55:32.32
He comes in the whole day.

1402
00:55:32.32 --> 00:55:35.48
We sit there, he walks in, walks out, walks in, leaves.

1403
00:55:35.48 --> 00:55:38.28
And then he comes in the evening, he says, okay, he says,

1404
00:55:39.28 --> 00:55:40.88
I'll see you Friday.

1405
00:55:40.88 --> 00:55:42.28
Don't come in, be, see you Friday.

1406
00:55:42.28 --> 00:55:43.88
So that was another week.

1407
00:55:43.88 --> 00:55:45.68
We came in that Friday.

1408
00:55:45.68 --> 00:55:48.72
He said, I talked to your instructors.

1409
00:55:48.72 --> 00:55:50.72
I told him who you were.

1410
00:55:50.72 --> 00:55:52.20
I asked him about what went down

1411
00:55:52.20 --> 00:55:54.000
and they're willing to give you a chance.

1412
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.44
But I have a condition.

1413
00:55:57.44 --> 00:55:59.44
We're like, okay.

1414
00:55:59.44 --> 00:56:03.20
He says, one of you quit or get hurt.

1415
00:56:03.20 --> 00:56:05.96
For any reason, you're all gone.

1416
00:56:08.96 --> 00:56:13.96
So I'm like, I looked at my guys.

1417
00:56:13.96 --> 00:56:18.96
I looked at my guys, I said, look guys, this is important.

1418
00:56:21.84 --> 00:56:24.08
If you don't want to do this, don't do it

1419
00:56:24.08 --> 00:56:27.96
because I got to do it, right?

1420
00:56:27.96 --> 00:56:31.12
I don't want to, I had a hard time being a loser.

1421
00:56:31.12 --> 00:56:33.44
I had a hard time letting guys,

1422
00:56:33.44 --> 00:56:36.36
you know what they did, even when I was getting beaten up,

1423
00:56:36.36 --> 00:56:38.04
the inside warriors working and going,

1424
00:56:38.04 --> 00:56:39.56
now you're going to figure it out.

1425
00:56:39.56 --> 00:56:41.48
You're going to take care of this.

1426
00:56:41.48 --> 00:56:45.64
And I wanted the chance to push it all the way, right?

1427
00:56:46.56 --> 00:56:48.64
And it was like, no, we're in.

1428
00:56:48.64 --> 00:56:50.12
We all agreed, right?

1429
00:56:50.12 --> 00:56:54.80
So the first day of 42, first day of 42,

1430
00:56:54.80 --> 00:56:59.08
Oliver comes out, García, Schellenberger,

1431
00:56:59.08 --> 00:57:01.84
Steele, McGee and Moe, Lester Moe.

1432
00:57:01.84 --> 00:57:02.76
He was the one who got,

1433
00:57:02.76 --> 00:57:04.68
one out of our class that got killed.

1434
00:57:04.68 --> 00:57:05.96
Second class torpedo man.

1435
00:57:07.44 --> 00:57:09.60
Out of the six of us, two of us became SEALs.

1436
00:57:09.60 --> 00:57:11.64
We were drafted into SEAL team.

1437
00:57:11.64 --> 00:57:15.32
We didn't go UDT, like you used to have to go to UDT training.

1438
00:57:15.32 --> 00:57:17.08
And then you go to do tours of UDT

1439
00:57:17.08 --> 00:57:18.88
and then you volunteer for SEAL, right?

1440
00:57:19.88 --> 00:57:22.80
So did you go, did you re-class up?

1441
00:57:22.80 --> 00:57:24.12
Did you start with a brand new class?

1442
00:57:24.12 --> 00:57:24.96
Yeah.

1443
00:57:24.96 --> 00:57:26.36
So you went all the way back through first phase again?

1444
00:57:26.36 --> 00:57:27.20
Back through how we could do?

1445
00:57:27.20 --> 00:57:28.52
Start all over and here they are.

1446
00:57:28.52 --> 00:57:30.36
We're up there in front, we're front and center.

1447
00:57:30.36 --> 00:57:32.68
They said about face, facing the class.

1448
00:57:32.68 --> 00:57:34.60
These motherfuckers are quitters.

1449
00:57:34.60 --> 00:57:36.40
Don't walk to them, don't talk to them,

1450
00:57:36.40 --> 00:57:38.44
don't be around them, don't hang with them

1451
00:57:38.44 --> 00:57:40.56
because that's who they are.

1452
00:57:40.56 --> 00:57:41.88
So everybody's just kinda looking,

1453
00:57:41.88 --> 00:57:44.000
the only cats in 42, right?

1454
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.20
And so they put us in the same boat crew.

1455
00:57:46.20 --> 00:57:48.36
And it was miserable, man.

1456
00:57:48.36 --> 00:57:50.92
I mean, it was, me and Garcia were the two little guys

1457
00:57:50.92 --> 00:57:54.48
in front and Scheller and Steele were a little bit higher

1458
00:57:54.48 --> 00:57:56.12
and McGee and Moe were taller.

1459
00:57:56.12 --> 00:57:59.000
So our boat was pretty, it was a lot better than like this.

1460
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.76
It was kinda like this.

1461
00:58:00.76 --> 00:58:03.48
And they put it on us.

1462
00:58:03.48 --> 00:58:05.92
And I look at some of the guys like now in my class,

1463
00:58:05.92 --> 00:58:07.40
he said, then they said look over us

1464
00:58:07.40 --> 00:58:08.56
and see what's happened to us.

1465
00:58:08.56 --> 00:58:10.36
Like, well, shit, they ain't quitting.

1466
00:58:10.36 --> 00:58:11.32
You know?

1467
00:58:11.32 --> 00:58:15.04
And so then we get ready to go do Hell Week.

1468
00:58:15.04 --> 00:58:17.16
So I'm looking at my guys.

1469
00:58:17.16 --> 00:58:21.76
By the way, it takes like months and months and months

1470
00:58:21.76 --> 00:58:24.000
to recover from Hell Week.

1471
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.48
So you had been through Hell Week

1472
00:58:25.48 --> 00:58:26.96
all the way until the last day.

1473
00:58:26.96 --> 00:58:27.80
Yeah.

1474
00:58:27.80 --> 00:58:30.28
And then you just went right back into a freaking class.

1475
00:58:30.28 --> 00:58:31.60
Then there was like about,

1476
00:58:31.60 --> 00:58:33.60
I don't know, like there was probably about the three weeks

1477
00:58:33.60 --> 00:58:34.44
or something like that.

1478
00:58:34.44 --> 00:58:35.28
And it was the next class.

1479
00:58:35.28 --> 00:58:36.12
Damn.

1480
00:58:36.12 --> 00:58:37.12
We still had blisters on our ass.

1481
00:58:37.12 --> 00:58:37.96
For sure.

1482
00:58:37.96 --> 00:58:40.64
You know, and our hands were still jacked up.

1483
00:58:40.64 --> 00:58:44.08
So we're looking at each other and said,

1484
00:58:44.08 --> 00:58:46.20
okay, this is it.

1485
00:58:46.20 --> 00:58:48.64
We're, what's gonna be painful.

1486
00:58:48.64 --> 00:58:51.28
But what they did then is the officers picked people

1487
00:58:51.28 --> 00:58:52.12
in their classes.

1488
00:58:52.12 --> 00:58:54.20
That's how I got wanted with CrowdAd.

1489
00:58:54.20 --> 00:58:55.04
Right?

1490
00:58:55.04 --> 00:59:00.04
Mr. Kirkland picked me, CrowdAd, Courtney, Inglena,

1491
00:59:01.56 --> 00:59:02.76
and Pauselt.

1492
00:59:02.76 --> 00:59:04.04
What for like their boat crew?

1493
00:59:04.04 --> 00:59:05.04
The boat crew.

1494
00:59:05.04 --> 00:59:05.88
There were six of us.

1495
00:59:05.88 --> 00:59:07.44
And Pauselt were two little guys.

1496
00:59:07.44 --> 00:59:10.92
And then Courtney and Crawford were a little bigger.

1497
00:59:10.92 --> 00:59:15.92
And then Mr. Kirkland, and I forgot the other guy was.

1498
00:59:16.16 --> 00:59:17.40
They do it all by height now.

1499
00:59:17.40 --> 00:59:19.80
So they take all the smaller guys put them together.

1500
00:59:19.80 --> 00:59:21.52
They take all the tall guys put them together.

1501
00:59:21.52 --> 00:59:23.20
Arms were pretty much together.

1502
00:59:23.20 --> 00:59:26.72
Six, there were six of us in the boat crew, not seven.

1503
00:59:26.72 --> 00:59:28.72
And we were the number one boat crew.

1504
00:59:28.72 --> 00:59:29.80
We won.

1505
00:59:29.80 --> 00:59:30.64
We won this.

1506
00:59:30.64 --> 00:59:33.32
And I was at CrowdAd tells the story of when,

1507
00:59:33.32 --> 00:59:35.60
cause we did all those harassment things.

1508
00:59:35.60 --> 00:59:37.68
Well, I did one had to run on my knees like this.

1509
00:59:37.68 --> 00:59:40.76
And another guys were chief Allen comes out there

1510
00:59:40.76 --> 00:59:42.60
and stand in front of me knocking this around.

1511
00:59:42.60 --> 00:59:45.96
And I'm like, Hey guys, help me.

1512
00:59:45.96 --> 00:59:48.84
So we as trainees, right?

1513
00:59:48.84 --> 00:59:51.60
In 42, a lot of guys think outside the box.

1514
00:59:51.60 --> 00:59:54.52
There's a lot of guys in 42, but we are the ones

1515
00:59:54.52 --> 00:59:56.56
that challenged our instructors.

1516
00:59:56.56 --> 00:59:59.20
Oliver, sing a song, Indian guy, right?

1517
00:59:59.20 --> 01:00:01.52
One little two little three little Indians.

1518
01:00:01.52 --> 01:00:03.36
Bang, bang, bang.

1519
01:00:03.36 --> 01:00:04.88
Oh, you're fucking thing is funny.

1520
01:00:04.88 --> 01:00:09.04
Do you know, it sticks us out on the swimmer line, right?

1521
01:00:09.04 --> 01:00:10.52
We're out there on the swimmer line.

1522
01:00:10.52 --> 01:00:12.88
He goes, all I need is one of you to quit.

1523
01:00:12.88 --> 01:00:14.64
So I'm way at the back end.

1524
01:00:14.64 --> 01:00:16.32
Have you all of her?

1525
01:00:16.32 --> 01:00:17.80
Have me, I'll have you.

1526
01:00:17.80 --> 01:00:19.68
You sons of bitches will be out there all night.

1527
01:00:19.68 --> 01:00:20.80
And we were because it was, you know,

1528
01:00:20.80 --> 01:00:22.000
the tide goes in and out.

1529
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.28
And then chief Allen is sitting there.

1530
01:00:23.28 --> 01:00:24.32
There used to be a lady called,

1531
01:00:24.32 --> 01:00:26.72
well, Wolfman Jack was one guy that was going on.

1532
01:00:26.72 --> 01:00:28.000
It's Wolfman Jack.

1533
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.32
I'm doing song music.

1534
01:00:29.32 --> 01:00:32.20
And then there was a lady named her sister Margaret,

1535
01:00:32.20 --> 01:00:33.96
black ladies.

1536
01:00:33.96 --> 01:00:36.08
Do you have problems?

1537
01:00:36.08 --> 01:00:37.88
Do you have pain in your heart?

1538
01:00:38.92 --> 01:00:40.68
If you don't know what you're doing in your life,

1539
01:00:40.68 --> 01:00:44.56
sister Margaret, call her at 355-3585.

1540
01:00:44.56 --> 01:00:48.52
And it was like, eff you sister Margaret.

1541
01:00:48.52 --> 01:00:51.72
Our guys were fighting, we're fighting back, right?

1542
01:00:51.72 --> 01:00:53.32
We're fighting back for that humanity.

1543
01:00:53.32 --> 01:00:55.88
They're, we're fighting back to reveal that.

1544
01:00:55.88 --> 01:01:00.28
That's why 42 is a pretty tight class and big, you know?

1545
01:01:00.28 --> 01:01:02.80
Because the nature of that class.

1546
01:01:02.80 --> 01:01:06.16
The nature of that class was set like that.

1547
01:01:06.16 --> 01:01:07.60
And when we went through training,

1548
01:01:07.60 --> 01:01:10.000
those guys helped me get through this evolution.

1549
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.36
Chief Allen lost his glasses.

1550
01:01:12.36 --> 01:01:13.20
Corporate Ted said,

1551
01:01:13.20 --> 01:01:15.28
we went out looking for his glasses and you went over,

1552
01:01:15.28 --> 01:01:16.76
oh, I got it over here, killer whale.

1553
01:01:16.76 --> 01:01:18.44
We called him killer whale, right?

1554
01:01:18.44 --> 01:01:21.52
And I stood up and if I'm in the sand, I stomped on him.

1555
01:01:22.72 --> 01:01:25.12
Damn, I picked him up when I go, here you go.

1556
01:01:26.32 --> 01:01:30.32
He looked down, he goes straightens him up,

1557
01:01:30.32 --> 01:01:35.32
puts him on, goes, cool, walks off.

1558
01:01:36.04 --> 01:01:38.56
Crawler did his heart felt through his ass,

1559
01:01:38.56 --> 01:01:40.92
and he's going, oh my God, he's going to kill us.

1560
01:01:40.92 --> 01:01:43.12
But that's what they want.

1561
01:01:43.12 --> 01:01:45.32
Your instructors aren't there to kill you and make you.

1562
01:01:45.32 --> 01:01:47.96
They want, they want, now I see it as totally different.

1563
01:01:47.96 --> 01:01:50.56
Not break you down to make you.

1564
01:01:50.56 --> 01:01:52.84
You didn't hear a lot of these seals, right?

1565
01:01:52.84 --> 01:01:55.08
Well, they break you down so we can mold you right back.

1566
01:01:55.08 --> 01:01:57.24
Uh-uh, I'm seeing it now.

1567
01:01:57.24 --> 01:01:58.44
They were breaking me down.

1568
01:01:58.44 --> 01:02:01.72
So that little kid, that little warrior Espinoza in there,

1569
01:02:01.72 --> 01:02:06.44
that young kid that wants to, that is peeled off, right?

1570
01:02:06.44 --> 01:02:07.84
Through the hurt, through the fear,

1571
01:02:07.84 --> 01:02:09.84
through the mistreatment, all that is pulled off.

1572
01:02:09.84 --> 01:02:12.60
I'm never going to be the same as those other,

1573
01:02:12.60 --> 01:02:15.08
however you become a success.

1574
01:02:15.08 --> 01:02:18.28
But that little boy, I want to get back there

1575
01:02:18.28 --> 01:02:21.16
because that's the whole incomplete person that I was.

1576
01:02:21.16 --> 01:02:23.92
So when I strip off all the bullshit, right,

1577
01:02:23.92 --> 01:02:25.92
without the socialization that comes in,

1578
01:02:25.92 --> 01:02:28.84
through the society or the socialization that happens

1579
01:02:28.84 --> 01:02:31.36
in your own family, the pure thing, you know,

1580
01:02:31.36 --> 01:02:34.08
your kids fighting each other or brothers fighting each other

1581
01:02:34.08 --> 01:02:37.000
or in your neighborhood, Bobby Cervantes,

1582
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.52
you know, going to pick on him because he's black

1583
01:02:39.52 --> 01:02:42.16
and he looked like Cochise and he was the target

1584
01:02:42.16 --> 01:02:45.60
of every teacher we had through racism and classism

1585
01:02:45.60 --> 01:02:46.44
and everything else.

1586
01:02:46.44 --> 01:02:49.40
How is he going to get power to fight back?

1587
01:02:49.40 --> 01:02:50.28
Right?

1588
01:02:50.28 --> 01:02:53.36
How are you going to take somebody that is in a community?

1589
01:02:53.36 --> 01:02:55.40
If you were to take in our family, our community,

1590
01:02:55.40 --> 01:02:59.44
our seal community, our family community, we all fought back.

1591
01:02:59.44 --> 01:03:00.92
So that's why there were so many of us

1592
01:03:00.92 --> 01:03:01.76
and that's why we're all,

1593
01:03:01.76 --> 01:03:04.88
even though later on in our lives, we do things

1594
01:03:04.88 --> 01:03:07.72
that cause discord between me and you as a teammate.

1595
01:03:08.72 --> 01:03:11.24
The bottom line, the one thing that we did have

1596
01:03:11.24 --> 01:03:13.16
was that relationship of understanding

1597
01:03:13.16 --> 01:03:17.08
that we were being revealed, not created,

1598
01:03:17.08 --> 01:03:20.36
but being revealed that, yeah, well,

1599
01:03:20.36 --> 01:03:23.60
in order for me to do this, in order for me to be,

1600
01:03:23.60 --> 01:03:26.44
my notes, you don't have a Rolex, but the old seal team,

1601
01:03:26.44 --> 01:03:27.72
real seals got them.

1602
01:03:27.72 --> 01:03:29.16
No, I just got a time X.

1603
01:03:30.60 --> 01:03:32.88
I'm not in the real seal category anymore.

1604
01:03:34.24 --> 01:03:36.36
Yeah, if you, if you're not, we'd sit and we'd pull

1605
01:03:36.36 --> 01:03:37.20
the covers off our Rolex.

1606
01:03:37.20 --> 01:03:38.04
Did you guys get issued?

1607
01:03:38.04 --> 01:03:39.16
You guys have got issued those?

1608
01:03:39.16 --> 01:03:40.000
Two-Dur Rolexes, yeah.

1609
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.40
See, that's, you know, I got some cars.

1610
01:03:42.40 --> 01:03:44.16
I'm going to file that with the complaint department.

1611
01:03:44.16 --> 01:03:45.64
You should, you should.

1612
01:03:45.64 --> 01:03:46.48
I got Jack.

1613
01:03:46.48 --> 01:03:47.88
That's how we knew who we were, you know?

1614
01:03:47.88 --> 01:03:49.92
Matter of fact, I'll tell you a story about this thing,

1615
01:03:49.92 --> 01:03:51.84
but, but you know that.

1616
01:03:51.84 --> 01:03:54.28
Well, I always say that, well, when people ask about,

1617
01:03:54.28 --> 01:03:58.28
you know, buds, which was buds for me, it was UDTRA for you.

1618
01:03:59.12 --> 01:04:00.36
Like, they don't teach you anything

1619
01:04:00.36 --> 01:04:01.84
and they don't teach you mental toughness.

1620
01:04:01.84 --> 01:04:04.76
You just, the people that don't have it, go away.

1621
01:04:04.76 --> 01:04:05.60
Right.

1622
01:04:05.60 --> 01:04:08.24
You start, it's sorting itself out in you.

1623
01:04:08.24 --> 01:04:12.32
And, and, and, and you know, the beautiful thing

1624
01:04:12.32 --> 01:04:14.000
about it too is that when you're both doing that

1625
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.24
and you and I are in the mud and we're crying,

1626
01:04:16.24 --> 01:04:18.56
we're sitting in a little room like this,

1627
01:04:18.56 --> 01:04:23.56
and you look up and you look at Garcia and go, okay.

1628
01:04:25.80 --> 01:04:26.64
All right.

1629
01:04:26.64 --> 01:04:28.08
And then Mokru cried out, right?

1630
01:04:28.08 --> 01:04:31.76
You know, or Pat on the ass or, hey, we can do this, you know?

1631
01:04:31.76 --> 01:04:34.20
And, and Chief Allen, you need to set,

1632
01:04:34.20 --> 01:04:35.92
especially on the race piece with that,

1633
01:04:35.92 --> 01:04:38.40
about who I am as a human being, right?

1634
01:04:38.40 --> 01:04:40.52
The great spirit there, I am the light that's in me,

1635
01:04:40.52 --> 01:04:42.36
that, that, that moves forward, right?

1636
01:04:43.48 --> 01:04:46.08
Me and Gregory Lee Garcia, cause we got rolled to 41, right?

1637
01:04:46.08 --> 01:04:47.92
We're sitting looking at each other, well, shit, man.

1638
01:04:47.92 --> 01:04:49.72
We're, we're screwed, you know?

1639
01:04:51.60 --> 01:04:52.84
Yeah, I know.

1640
01:04:52.84 --> 01:04:54.16
Did you ever know McIntosh?

1641
01:04:54.16 --> 01:04:55.32
Yep.

1642
01:04:55.32 --> 01:04:56.16
So McIntosh.

1643
01:04:56.16 --> 01:04:57.000
Butch. Yeah.

1644
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.08
So Butch comes walking in, he's in my class.

1645
01:04:59.08 --> 01:05:02.64
He comes walking in, he goes, hey, you guys in a 42?

1646
01:05:02.64 --> 01:05:03.48
Yeah.

1647
01:05:03.48 --> 01:05:06.08
He goes, oh, so am I.

1648
01:05:06.08 --> 01:05:08.36
It says, and I'm glad, I'm glad to see you guys, man.

1649
01:05:08.36 --> 01:05:10.88
It's just, because we're like, why is that?

1650
01:05:10.88 --> 01:05:12.72
It says, well, we got to stick together.

1651
01:05:13.68 --> 01:05:16.000
I said, we, we got to stick together.

1652
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.48
He says, because we're minorities.

1653
01:05:18.48 --> 01:05:21.32
I said, I said, hey, man, I said, me and Garcia,

1654
01:05:21.32 --> 01:05:23.84
we know we're minorities, but you're a white guy.

1655
01:05:23.84 --> 01:05:25.84
Cause he's, he's his complexion.

1656
01:05:25.84 --> 01:05:26.84
Do you know Butch?

1657
01:05:26.84 --> 01:05:27.68
No.

1658
01:05:27.68 --> 01:05:28.52
It's McIntosh.

1659
01:05:28.52 --> 01:05:29.36
Oh yeah, that's right.

1660
01:05:29.36 --> 01:05:30.68
Cause he's from like the islands.

1661
01:05:30.68 --> 01:05:32.000
St. Thomas VI.

1662
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.40
He's from the Bahamas.

1663
01:05:34.40 --> 01:05:37.28
So he's here, and he says, no, he says,

1664
01:05:37.28 --> 01:05:38.40
I'm not a white guy.

1665
01:05:38.40 --> 01:05:39.44
I said, yeah, you're, you're white.

1666
01:05:39.44 --> 01:05:40.76
He goes, no, I'm on.

1667
01:05:40.76 --> 01:05:42.68
He says, I'm from St. Thomas VI.

1668
01:05:42.68 --> 01:05:45.52
He says, so Gregory Lee goes,

1669
01:05:45.52 --> 01:05:46.68
what's the VI?

1670
01:05:46.68 --> 01:05:48.08
This is the Virgin Islands.

1671
01:05:48.08 --> 01:05:50.52
So we're Fresno and Colorado.

1672
01:05:50.52 --> 01:05:54.04
I said, you mean there's virgins on the islands.

1673
01:05:54.04 --> 01:05:56.32
He named them after, no man.

1674
01:05:56.32 --> 01:05:58.20
He said, it's named after red beard

1675
01:05:58.20 --> 01:05:59.60
or black beard, the pirate.

1676
01:05:59.60 --> 01:06:01.08
He says, the days of the Caribbean.

1677
01:06:01.08 --> 01:06:05.04
He says, rum, rum and lobster and, and the islands.

1678
01:06:05.04 --> 01:06:05.88
That's where I'm from.

1679
01:06:05.88 --> 01:06:08.36
My mom was, I said, but you're still, you're still,

1680
01:06:08.36 --> 01:06:09.52
you're still a white guy.

1681
01:06:09.52 --> 01:06:11.48
No. He says, I'm black from my mom.

1682
01:06:11.48 --> 01:06:14.24
He says, and I'm Dutch from my papa.

1683
01:06:14.24 --> 01:06:17.56
I says, but I says, you're, you're a white guy.

1684
01:06:17.56 --> 01:06:20.40
He goes, no, and he takes his foot like this.

1685
01:06:20.40 --> 01:06:21.32
He stomps it down.

1686
01:06:21.32 --> 01:06:24.64
He goes, no, I'm a soul.

1687
01:06:24.64 --> 01:06:29.64
Man. So, so I go, I go, I don't know, man.

1688
01:06:30.08 --> 01:06:31.48
I think he's so white guys.

1689
01:06:31.48 --> 01:06:32.64
He says, no, no, no.

1690
01:06:32.64 --> 01:06:33.92
So the very first day of training,

1691
01:06:33.92 --> 01:06:36.32
Chief Allen gets up there.

1692
01:06:36.32 --> 01:06:39.72
Espanol is a Garcia front and center, right?

1693
01:06:39.72 --> 01:06:41.16
The six of us, right?

1694
01:06:41.16 --> 01:06:43.40
The other four, we tried to be shallow.

1695
01:06:43.40 --> 01:06:44.68
We tried to sit in the silence.

1696
01:06:44.68 --> 01:06:47.44
We tried to sit in, we don't want to be,

1697
01:06:47.44 --> 01:06:48.64
you don't want to profile yourself.

1698
01:06:48.64 --> 01:06:51.88
You don't want, sometimes you are profiled.

1699
01:06:51.88 --> 01:06:53.92
It's just the way it is, right?

1700
01:06:53.92 --> 01:06:56.52
Understanding that it is, that it exists, right?

1701
01:06:56.52 --> 01:06:58.20
So he yells at us front and center.

1702
01:06:59.56 --> 01:07:00.76
Who ya chief Allen?

1703
01:07:00.76 --> 01:07:03.08
Fireman Espanol's report is ordered chief.

1704
01:07:05.04 --> 01:07:06.000
Who ya?

1705
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.96
Ermin Garcia report is ordered chief.

1706
01:07:09.12 --> 01:07:11.08
Yeah. You guys, he's looking at us.

1707
01:07:11.08 --> 01:07:16.08
He goes, I'm going to use the word end, right?

1708
01:07:16.12 --> 01:07:18.32
Espanol's, you've seen these big black and beautiful.

1709
01:07:18.32 --> 01:07:20.16
He's like you, right?

1710
01:07:20.16 --> 01:07:23.44
He's like, you see any ends around here?

1711
01:07:26.16 --> 01:07:27.48
It's got to be a trick question.

1712
01:07:27.48 --> 01:07:28.32
Sounds like a trick question.

1713
01:07:28.32 --> 01:07:29.64
It could be a setup.

1714
01:07:29.64 --> 01:07:31.08
Could be, because that's what you do.

1715
01:07:31.08 --> 01:07:33.16
The whole training is that.

1716
01:07:33.16 --> 01:07:34.000
Think about it.

1717
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.20
The whole training is that when an instructor

1718
01:07:35.20 --> 01:07:36.68
has an event with you,

1719
01:07:36.68 --> 01:07:38.36
there's something that they want out of you.

1720
01:07:38.36 --> 01:07:40.96
They're guiding you or they want to provoke you.

1721
01:07:40.96 --> 01:07:42.88
Either anger or whatever that stuff.

1722
01:07:42.88 --> 01:07:45.68
And I learned it's always better to cry

1723
01:07:45.68 --> 01:07:48.40
when you're in pain than to be in anger

1724
01:07:48.40 --> 01:07:52.92
because the results of anger can, it's a hard deal, right?

1725
01:07:52.92 --> 01:07:55.000
So I said, no chief Allen.

1726
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.48
I said, I don't see any.

1727
01:07:56.48 --> 01:07:58.44
I don't see any around here.

1728
01:07:58.44 --> 01:07:59.28
Garcia?

1729
01:08:00.16 --> 01:08:01.000
No chief Allen.

1730
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.92
I don't see any around here.

1731
01:08:04.16 --> 01:08:06.32
He says, well from now on for the rest of this class,

1732
01:08:06.32 --> 01:08:08.000
when I want an end front and center,

1733
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.28
it says when I want an end,

1734
01:08:09.28 --> 01:08:10.84
you two come front and center, right?

1735
01:08:10.84 --> 01:08:12.40
Do you understand that?

1736
01:08:12.40 --> 01:08:15.76
So I'm going, well chief,

1737
01:08:16.76 --> 01:08:18.000
and we just got done with the,

1738
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.92
we were with the swimming trunks on our boots, right?

1739
01:08:20.92 --> 01:08:24.24
I said, I think, I think Magintosh.

1740
01:08:24.24 --> 01:08:29.24
I said, I said, I said, Magintosh.

1741
01:08:31.44 --> 01:08:33.000
He goes, where's he at?

1742
01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.60
We're all out there, right?

1743
01:08:34.60 --> 01:08:35.72
We don't have suntans yet.

1744
01:08:35.72 --> 01:08:37.52
We're out there and he goes, I said,

1745
01:08:37.52 --> 01:08:39.20
the guy, we're on the far left.

1746
01:08:39.20 --> 01:08:41.60
He goes, far left.

1747
01:08:41.60 --> 01:08:44.000
He goes, yeah, he's Magintosh, front and center.

1748
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.60
So Magintosh, he doesn't run out there like we do,

1749
01:08:46.60 --> 01:08:47.60
you know, we're in our military.

1750
01:08:47.60 --> 01:08:51.04
So Magintosh lobes out like a gazelle.

1751
01:08:51.04 --> 01:08:52.68
He jumps out and lobe it.

1752
01:08:52.68 --> 01:08:53.96
Comes out from the chief.

1753
01:08:54.92 --> 01:08:57.68
Aaron Magintosh reported to his chief.

1754
01:08:57.68 --> 01:09:02.68
He goes, Magintosh, are you an end?

1755
01:09:02.68 --> 01:09:07.68
No, chief Allen, I'm a soul.

1756
01:09:09.72 --> 01:09:12.76
Chief Allen looks at him, he goes, turn around.

1757
01:09:12.76 --> 01:09:15.04
So he didn't bow face, looks his back, it was his.

1758
01:09:15.04 --> 01:09:17.000
Turn sideways, turn sideways.

1759
01:09:18.28 --> 01:09:20.08
Turn sideways again, so he turns sideways.

1760
01:09:20.08 --> 01:09:24.000
He looked at him, he goes, yeah, Magintosh.

1761
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.32
He says, I think you are an end.

1762
01:09:26.32 --> 01:09:28.84
As a matter of fact, you're the ugliest mother.

1763
01:09:28.84 --> 01:09:30.76
And I've ever seen in my life,

1764
01:09:30.76 --> 01:09:33.12
hit the bay and take these other two ends with you, man.

1765
01:09:33.12 --> 01:09:36.60
So there we were, we would be in class.

1766
01:09:36.60 --> 01:09:39.84
We'd be in class, chief Allen, saying, hey,

1767
01:09:39.84 --> 01:09:41.28
all you ends hit the bay.

1768
01:09:42.28 --> 01:09:44.84
We run, hit the bay, get wet, we come back,

1769
01:09:44.84 --> 01:09:45.84
you know, recover, right?

1770
01:09:45.84 --> 01:09:48.08
We come back and sit in class.

1771
01:09:48.08 --> 01:09:50.68
So that's what he gave us.

1772
01:09:51.80 --> 01:09:54.32
You know, he gave that to us to say,

1773
01:09:54.32 --> 01:09:56.44
it's kind of like a letter that I wrote to a girl

1774
01:09:56.44 --> 01:09:58.20
that I thought I was breaking up with, you know,

1775
01:09:58.20 --> 01:10:00.12
about all I love you, da, da, da, da, da, da.

1776
01:10:00.12 --> 01:10:05.12
And somebody says, oh, and she didn't come back to me, right?

1777
01:10:05.56 --> 01:10:07.44
But it's just, they say, oh, oh,

1778
01:10:07.44 --> 01:10:09.64
she gave you a beautiful gift.

1779
01:10:09.64 --> 01:10:11.48
I mean, what kind of a beautiful gift is this?

1780
01:10:11.48 --> 01:10:12.76
We still broke up.

1781
01:10:12.76 --> 01:10:17.76
No, the deal is, you wrote how you can love somebody.

1782
01:10:18.36 --> 01:10:19.52
That's who you're looking for.

1783
01:10:19.52 --> 01:10:20.88
That's what they did.

1784
01:10:20.88 --> 01:10:22.88
They gave us stuff and put us in that pain

1785
01:10:22.88 --> 01:10:25.48
so that we would reveal ourselves.

1786
01:10:26.60 --> 01:10:27.76
So we could say, well,

1787
01:10:27.76 --> 01:10:29.76
we're gonna go to the bathroom and we're gonna go to the

1788
01:10:29.76 --> 01:10:31.76
bathroom and we're gonna go to the bathroom.

1789
01:10:31.76 --> 01:10:33.76
And then one day he comes out and he says,

1790
01:10:33.76 --> 01:10:35.44
all you non-ans hit the bait.

1791
01:10:35.44 --> 01:10:38.28
Well, me, I knew who I was, right?

1792
01:10:38.28 --> 01:10:41.76
I'm standing, me and Garcy, we're standing there

1793
01:10:41.76 --> 01:10:44.36
and all the white guys gone and the two Koreans

1794
01:10:44.36 --> 01:10:46.76
and two Turks, man, they're in the water too.

1795
01:10:46.76 --> 01:10:48.76
They're in the water, right?

1796
01:10:48.76 --> 01:10:50.76
So, so I happened a couple of times,

1797
01:10:50.76 --> 01:10:52.08
a couple of evolutions, right?

1798
01:10:52.08 --> 01:10:53.76
And so finally, Yankee too comes up,

1799
01:10:53.76 --> 01:10:55.76
he's Korean guy, he goes, epi, epi.

1800
01:10:55.76 --> 01:10:59.76
And then, in, none in, Mr. Chal, we water.

1801
01:10:59.76 --> 01:11:02.76
I said, you from now on, you and in.

1802
01:11:02.76 --> 01:11:07.76
Oh, okay, okay, okay, I understand.

1803
01:11:08.76 --> 01:11:10.76
And so then the two Koreans stood,

1804
01:11:10.76 --> 01:11:12.76
the whole class went in the water,

1805
01:11:12.76 --> 01:11:14.76
and Mark Schoenberg, who looked like, how do you do these?

1806
01:11:14.76 --> 01:11:16.76
He's got little blue eyes, you know,

1807
01:11:16.76 --> 01:11:19.76
and got teeth that actually later on in Oliver

1808
01:11:19.76 --> 01:11:24.76
and broke his teeth, pushed on his head on a swimming pool,

1809
01:11:24.76 --> 01:11:26.76
right, and the water is decked and he had his teeth.

1810
01:11:26.76 --> 01:11:28.76
Chief Allen comes up to him and goes,

1811
01:11:28.76 --> 01:11:31.76
Schoenberg, who you got, Chief Allen?

1812
01:11:31.76 --> 01:11:35.76
I said, I thought I said all you none in's hit the bay.

1813
01:11:35.76 --> 01:11:37.76
Who you got, Chief Allen?

1814
01:11:38.76 --> 01:11:41.76
I said, all you none in's hit the bay.

1815
01:11:41.76 --> 01:11:43.76
Schoenberg stood up and said, Chief Allen,

1816
01:11:43.76 --> 01:11:45.76
today I am an in.

1817
01:11:47.76 --> 01:11:50.76
He looked at me and goes, cool, walks off.

1818
01:11:50.76 --> 01:11:52.76
So then the rest of the class,

1819
01:11:52.76 --> 01:11:54.76
the rest of the class are going,

1820
01:11:54.76 --> 01:11:56.76
what the hell is going on with this stuff?

1821
01:11:56.76 --> 01:11:58.76
We told him, hey, tell me, hey,

1822
01:11:58.76 --> 01:12:00.76
so then after that everybody knew

1823
01:12:00.76 --> 01:12:03.76
and the Koreans knew, but we didn't tell the two Turks.

1824
01:12:03.76 --> 01:12:06.76
So the two Turks were in the bay,

1825
01:12:06.76 --> 01:12:08.76
then we told them.

1826
01:12:08.76 --> 01:12:10.76
But, you know, and the very first day of training,

1827
01:12:10.76 --> 01:12:13.76
like in 41, Oliver comes up, right?

1828
01:12:13.76 --> 01:12:16.76
He comes walking up, got his ball cap,

1829
01:12:16.76 --> 01:12:20.76
chew here, scar there, little blue slicker,

1830
01:12:20.76 --> 01:12:23.76
cut off, you know, the instructor shorts,

1831
01:12:23.76 --> 01:12:28.76
the big diver socks with his shiny Cochrane boots.

1832
01:12:28.76 --> 01:12:31.76
He comes walking up, got an umbrella,

1833
01:12:31.76 --> 01:12:33.76
walks up and we're all standing there,

1834
01:12:33.76 --> 01:12:36.76
and he looks at all of us, walks out cocky.

1835
01:12:40.76 --> 01:12:42.76
Looks at all of us, says.

1836
01:12:44.76 --> 01:12:46.76
As you can see on my slicker,

1837
01:12:46.76 --> 01:12:50.76
this says Big G, little O, little D.

1838
01:12:50.76 --> 01:12:53.76
There's only one Big G, big O, big D,

1839
01:12:53.76 --> 01:12:55.76
and that's a creative of the universe.

1840
01:12:55.76 --> 01:12:58.76
And he's a creator of you and me.

1841
01:12:58.76 --> 01:13:00.76
But God's not here.

1842
01:13:00.76 --> 01:13:02.76
But I am.

1843
01:13:02.76 --> 01:13:04.76
So for the next 18 weeks, when I tell you to run,

1844
01:13:04.76 --> 01:13:06.76
you will run.

1845
01:13:06.76 --> 01:13:08.76
When I tell you to drop, you will drop.

1846
01:13:08.76 --> 01:13:10.76
When I tell you to shit, I'll tell you what color.

1847
01:13:10.76 --> 01:13:13.76
He did an about face, popped up his umbrella,

1848
01:13:13.76 --> 01:13:15.76
and walked off.

1849
01:13:15.76 --> 01:13:17.76
That was another one of those,

1850
01:13:17.76 --> 01:13:21.76
that's been those, you know, what the hell are you doing here, right?

1851
01:13:21.76 --> 01:13:26.76
So those two instructors are more Moyes picture.

1852
01:13:26.76 --> 01:13:29.76
You know, and you asked Moye about when he,

1853
01:13:29.76 --> 01:13:32.76
when, you know, he's told a couple of hilarious stories about.

1854
01:13:32.76 --> 01:13:33.76
What class was Moye in?

1855
01:13:33.76 --> 01:13:35.76
He's probably like,

1856
01:13:37.76 --> 01:13:41.76
he's probably about two before me, maybe 39, maybe 37.

1857
01:13:41.76 --> 01:13:44.76
You know, he's an older guy.

1858
01:13:44.76 --> 01:13:46.76
I mean, I think probably 37, something like that.

1859
01:13:46.76 --> 01:13:48.76
But anyway, he did his stuff.

1860
01:13:48.76 --> 01:13:53.76
And he tells a cool story about being with Olivera.

1861
01:13:53.76 --> 01:13:56.76
They lost one of the boat crews somehow there,

1862
01:13:56.76 --> 01:13:58.76
because they were trying during hell week.

1863
01:13:58.76 --> 01:14:00.76
So they went out in a vehicle trying to track them down,

1864
01:14:00.76 --> 01:14:01.76
find out where they are.

1865
01:14:01.76 --> 01:14:05.76
And they ran, they had buried themselves under their boat in the sand.

1866
01:14:05.76 --> 01:14:09.76
So boom, they hit it about lost control of the vehicle.

1867
01:14:09.76 --> 01:14:13.76
And they come back around and everybody's up and about, you know,

1868
01:14:13.76 --> 01:14:16.76
he says, it's so cool because Olivera just comes in and says,

1869
01:14:16.76 --> 01:14:18.76
yeah, we'll catch you hiding like that again.

1870
01:14:18.76 --> 01:14:20.76
He says, and we're going to run over you again.

1871
01:14:20.76 --> 01:14:24.76
You know, he's like, he says, we didn't know where they were at, you know,

1872
01:14:24.76 --> 01:14:29.76
but there's a lot of, there's a lot of that stuff, you know, but yeah.

1873
01:14:29.76 --> 01:14:30.76
So those, those two instructors.

1874
01:14:30.76 --> 01:14:37.76
And so then when we graduated, right, we went through the training,

1875
01:14:37.76 --> 01:14:40.76
you know, and we were in different boat crews and I did.

1876
01:14:40.76 --> 01:14:42.76
And I assume all six guys, all six made it.

1877
01:14:42.76 --> 01:14:45.76
And two of us went in the seal team.

1878
01:14:45.76 --> 01:14:47.76
We were drafted into the seal team.

1879
01:14:47.76 --> 01:14:50.76
When, when I met you for the first time, you were telling me about,

1880
01:14:50.76 --> 01:14:55.76
but one of the instructors saying to you, can you change the temperature of the water?

1881
01:14:55.76 --> 01:14:56.76
That was all of it.

1882
01:14:56.76 --> 01:14:57.76
What happened with that? Tell us that.

1883
01:14:57.76 --> 01:15:00.76
Well, I'm freezing my ass off, right?

1884
01:15:00.76 --> 01:15:02.76
You're 120 pounds, right?

1885
01:15:02.76 --> 01:15:03.76
I grabbed the big guy.

1886
01:15:03.76 --> 01:15:06.76
It wasn't, it wasn't a homophobic thing at all, man.

1887
01:15:06.76 --> 01:15:09.76
I was, you know, they're putting off heat, man.

1888
01:15:09.76 --> 01:15:13.76
And I'm sitting there crying all over here.

1889
01:15:13.76 --> 01:15:14.76
Come on.

1890
01:15:14.76 --> 01:15:16.76
Who y'all there?

1891
01:15:16.76 --> 01:15:19.76
What's the temperature of the ocean?

1892
01:15:19.76 --> 01:15:22.76
The temperature of the ocean.

1893
01:15:22.76 --> 01:15:24.76
And I'm crying.

1894
01:15:24.76 --> 01:15:28.76
I got tears because, and I'm glad I was wet because I don't,

1895
01:15:28.76 --> 01:15:30.76
no man wants to see another man cry.

1896
01:15:30.76 --> 01:15:31.76
So I'm crying.

1897
01:15:31.76 --> 01:15:35.76
He says, can you change the temperature of the ocean?

1898
01:15:35.76 --> 01:15:38.76
And I'm thinking, well, if I piss in my wetsuit a little bit,

1899
01:15:38.76 --> 01:15:42.76
but I'm not, I'm not wearing a wetsuit.

1900
01:15:42.76 --> 01:15:44.76
So, and I don't want to be a smart ass, right?

1901
01:15:44.76 --> 01:15:47.76
Because this don't want to be a, all these guys have said,

1902
01:15:47.76 --> 01:15:50.76
oh yeah, I told you instructor this when I went through training

1903
01:15:50.76 --> 01:15:52.76
and I, like, bullshit.

1904
01:15:52.76 --> 01:15:56.76
I mean, if they wanted to hurt you, they could hurt you anytime they wanted to, right?

1905
01:15:56.76 --> 01:15:57.76
That's the power.

1906
01:15:57.76 --> 01:15:59.76
That's, it's like society.

1907
01:15:59.76 --> 01:16:01.76
There are some people that are here that are here.

1908
01:16:01.76 --> 01:16:03.76
How do you want to function in it?

1909
01:16:03.76 --> 01:16:06.76
You can be in it and be in pain, but you're not, you're not going to give it up.

1910
01:16:06.76 --> 01:16:09.76
So I'm there in pain.

1911
01:16:09.76 --> 01:16:12.76
And I said, no Oliver.

1912
01:16:12.76 --> 01:16:14.76
He looks at me and says, and it doesn't matter with the,

1913
01:16:14.76 --> 01:16:17.76
if in temperature the water is dozen, that's what I was saying.

1914
01:16:17.76 --> 01:16:20.76
No, Oliver.

1915
01:16:20.76 --> 01:16:24.76
Two days later, I'm phrasing again.

1916
01:16:24.76 --> 01:16:29.76
Kind of reminding when I was crying and the little kids were going to beat me up, you know.

1917
01:16:29.76 --> 01:16:30.76
Okay.

1918
01:16:30.76 --> 01:16:33.76
He says, can you change the temperature?

1919
01:16:33.76 --> 01:16:35.76
What's the temperature of the water, that's what I was saying?

1920
01:16:35.76 --> 01:16:39.76
It doesn't matter what the temperature of the water is, Oliver.

1921
01:16:39.76 --> 01:16:46.76
He goes, Espinosa, the temperature of the water is toasty warm.

1922
01:16:46.76 --> 01:16:49.76
So, so then I understood, right?

1923
01:16:49.76 --> 01:16:52.76
I can't change the temperature of the ocean, right?

1924
01:16:52.76 --> 01:16:55.76
And the thing about the teams is the only easy days yesterday, right?

1925
01:16:55.76 --> 01:16:58.76
Those two things in my life were very powerful.

1926
01:16:58.76 --> 01:17:00.76
The same as that fire that hit me, right?

1927
01:17:00.76 --> 01:17:05.76
But that is that piece I'm telling you is being revealing.

1928
01:17:05.76 --> 01:17:12.76
The one thing I did have though, was to say, I can't change the temperature of the ocean,

1929
01:17:12.76 --> 01:17:21.76
but I'm here, if I, I was thought of being with my six guys, right?

1930
01:17:21.76 --> 01:17:26.76
That not one of us gave it up, and that I can't give it up.

1931
01:17:26.76 --> 01:17:31.76
I got it, I'm choosing to be here, because at any time I can leave, anytime.

1932
01:17:31.76 --> 01:17:33.76
Nobody's telling me to stay here.

1933
01:17:33.76 --> 01:17:36.76
Nobody's telling me to be whatever, all the hurt and fear, I've changed.

1934
01:17:36.76 --> 01:17:38.76
I'm changing, I'm evolving.

1935
01:17:38.76 --> 01:17:43.76
And that day it was like three choices.

1936
01:17:43.76 --> 01:17:46.76
One, I can quit.

1937
01:17:46.76 --> 01:17:59.76
The second is, I can be here in misery, or I embrace it and say, this is the cost.

1938
01:17:59.76 --> 01:18:01.76
I say what it costs.

1939
01:18:01.76 --> 01:18:06.76
And in order for me to be where I want to be, there is going to be the point where,

1940
01:18:06.76 --> 01:18:12.76
and I think guys get it after they've graduated and go into the downrange into the combat area,

1941
01:18:12.76 --> 01:18:15.76
I'm going to die to do this.

1942
01:18:15.76 --> 01:18:18.76
I'm going to die, then quit.

1943
01:18:18.76 --> 01:18:20.76
That is part of the cost.

1944
01:18:20.76 --> 01:18:25.76
And that's what I love about my brothers, when I look at them, and we come to all that's point, right?

1945
01:18:25.76 --> 01:18:29.76
And we go out into our world and we understand that and we bring that into ourselves.

1946
01:18:29.76 --> 01:18:36.76
And then those cats that have all these behaviors, the racism, the sexism, the heteros,

1947
01:18:36.76 --> 01:18:44.76
all that bullshit, all those really weird behaviors, at one point in their life they were clean and a child.

1948
01:18:44.76 --> 01:18:46.76
They were for real.

1949
01:18:46.76 --> 01:18:50.76
And then after that, they go back and they pick this shit up, bring it back,

1950
01:18:50.76 --> 01:18:53.76
because that makes them feel comfortable of where they were.

1951
01:18:53.76 --> 01:18:57.76
They don't want to live in that spirit of being free, of being who you are,

1952
01:18:57.76 --> 01:19:00.76
because it makes you accountable to everything that happens to you.

1953
01:19:00.76 --> 01:19:03.76
Good or bad, psychological bullshit.

1954
01:19:03.76 --> 01:19:06.76
When I got on the fire department, I was dead.

1955
01:19:06.76 --> 01:19:08.76
I'd become inhuman.

1956
01:19:08.76 --> 01:19:11.76
I remember getting in Vietnam and my dad would say, give me.

1957
01:19:11.76 --> 01:19:14.76
I would remember you're a human being.

1958
01:19:14.76 --> 01:19:16.76
And I almost lost that.

1959
01:19:16.76 --> 01:19:18.76
And I remember seeing a jar of ears, right?

1960
01:19:18.76 --> 01:19:24.76
It wasn't my platoon, I don't know who did it or whatever, but my officers, being leaders, came up and,

1961
01:19:24.76 --> 01:19:29.76
old Bosin Campbell, man, he was an enlisted guy who became an ensign,

1962
01:19:29.76 --> 01:19:33.76
retired, actually, as a lieutenant commander, I think.

1963
01:19:33.76 --> 01:19:35.76
He said, see this shit?

1964
01:19:35.76 --> 01:19:37.76
We're all like, what is it, you know?

1965
01:19:37.76 --> 01:19:41.76
And then he says, we don't do this.

1966
01:19:41.76 --> 01:19:45.76
We're not going to get rid of this jar.

1967
01:19:45.76 --> 01:19:46.76
We don't do this shit.

1968
01:19:46.76 --> 01:19:49.76
Anybody we kill is going to have a weapon.

1969
01:19:49.76 --> 01:19:53.76
Or if they're collateral damage with people that have weapons, we're going to do that,

1970
01:19:53.76 --> 01:19:56.76
but we're not going to do this kind of stuff afterwards.

1971
01:19:56.76 --> 01:19:59.76
I think I said it was one of the things with the PRU program that was kind of weird,

1972
01:19:59.76 --> 01:20:03.76
because they kept body counts like that, you know, that inhumanity thing,

1973
01:20:03.76 --> 01:20:09.76
that whole CIA bullshit, you know, the whole PRU thing, you know, that they were all cowboys.

1974
01:20:09.76 --> 01:20:11.76
You could do whatever you wanted, you know?

1975
01:20:11.76 --> 01:20:26.76
And, you know, I think when I was there, a man's inhumanity to man, you know, I was with my buddy, Noyce, right?

1976
01:20:26.76 --> 01:20:32.76
We were working for the company and doing stuff, and we took a break, went to Saigon to party.

1977
01:20:32.76 --> 01:20:35.76
Hopped on a helicopter, took off.

1978
01:20:35.76 --> 01:20:38.76
I believe my cousin with the PRU program.

1979
01:20:38.76 --> 01:20:44.76
It was crazy, but partying with this, I saw this, I was always practicing my skills, my language skills,

1980
01:20:44.76 --> 01:20:47.76
and I saw this little Vietnamese guy looking at me, I'm looking at him, I said,

1981
01:20:47.76 --> 01:20:51.76
Hey, lady, comes over, auntie, what's your name?

1982
01:20:51.76 --> 01:20:56.76
I said, ah, I'll drink beer, you drink beer?

1983
01:20:56.76 --> 01:21:01.76
Yeah, he looked at me, I said, yeah, yeah, me, yeah.

1984
01:21:01.76 --> 01:21:08.76
So, I said, so his friends came, we sat and we drank, liked him, you know, we connected, you know,

1985
01:21:08.76 --> 01:21:13.76
sometimes you don't even know somebody, but you feel good with them, right?

1986
01:21:13.76 --> 01:21:18.76
We did that for two days, third day we had to leave, and when we left, because he was trying to learn English,

1987
01:21:18.76 --> 01:21:23.76
I was trying to learn English, Vietnamese, hugged each other, catch you later, and we take off.

1988
01:21:23.76 --> 01:21:27.76
Noyce was going, oh, shit, I'm in this Vietnamese, they don't know I'm an American.

1989
01:21:27.76 --> 01:21:35.76
We were in civilian clothes, they don't know who you are, you know, so Bill was sitting like this, you know, looking around.

1990
01:21:35.76 --> 01:21:40.76
But we spent three days there, and when we took over this group, which was the Green Beret group,

1991
01:21:40.76 --> 01:21:45.76
which was the crew program, my cousin was a Green Beret and another guy,

1992
01:21:45.76 --> 01:21:49.76
matter of fact, when we flew in, he was flying out, did the Green Beret hands leak,

1993
01:21:49.76 --> 01:21:56.76
wearing his aviator shades and stuff, and this guy is a black sergeant,

1994
01:21:56.76 --> 01:22:01.76
can't remember his name, but he said, oh, you just missed Captain Pacheco, and I'm like, wow.

1995
01:22:01.76 --> 01:22:10.76
And I said, what's his first name? He told me, I said, from Pupacoy, California, he goes, yeah, I said, that's my cousin.

1996
01:22:10.76 --> 01:22:18.76
Ah, bullshit, I said, is his mom's Aurora, and his dad's Celestino, yeah, I said, yeah, he's my cousin.

1997
01:22:18.76 --> 01:22:24.76
So when I got back, country, right, I started asking, I said, you ever heard this, I mentioned the name,

1998
01:22:24.76 --> 01:22:31.76
I mentioned the case worker, I mentioned the sergeant, and the name of the city, and he goes, why are you asking me this?

1999
01:22:31.76 --> 01:22:36.76
I said, do you remember when you got relieved and you hence alluded some cats coming in?

2000
01:22:36.76 --> 01:22:40.76
He said, you didn't close? He goes, yeah, so it was me and my mate.

2001
01:22:40.76 --> 01:22:48.76
Bullshit, you know, then he asked me, he says, what about, was there a guy with the white scarf of Viet Cong?

2002
01:22:48.76 --> 01:22:54.76
He said, did you ever run into him? I said, yeah, he shot the shit out of us, you know, but we were using the army tactics,

2003
01:22:54.76 --> 01:23:00.76
and we weren't using the seal tactics, right, and how we would patrol and our warning orders,

2004
01:23:00.76 --> 01:23:10.76
they were, you know, doing a fast warning order and the brief hop and then going, we never left, we never, it was like right away.

2005
01:23:10.76 --> 01:23:19.76
It wasn't like an hour, going an hour later, we popped out right away, because we knew about the intel leaks,

2006
01:23:19.76 --> 01:23:28.76
and so we got back, we decided to do a quick hop, and said, let's just go out, work, so we grabbed like five guys,

2007
01:23:28.76 --> 01:23:35.76
and we took off, didn't even tell the rest of the group, and we went out, night, early in the morning, got hit,

2008
01:23:35.76 --> 01:23:44.76
and we went and checked the bodies, and there was a kid with the white scarf, and the kid with the white scarf was the kid that we drank with in Saigon.

2009
01:23:44.76 --> 01:23:54.76
I looked at him, man, and I got, you know, I got emotional, and I told Noyce, he said, come here, Billy goes in and looks,

2010
01:23:54.76 --> 01:24:03.76
and he goes, oh my god, man, I think his name is Trann, but yeah, he looks at me and goes, man, you know,

2011
01:24:03.76 --> 01:24:17.76
and that's when I understood that warriors, right, that the ideologies of countries, right, use us, that we go fight these wars,

2012
01:24:17.76 --> 01:24:33.76
we go do whatever that is, but I wrote it, I got it, wrote it on my phone, right now I'm kind of…

2013
01:24:33.76 --> 01:24:35.76
Well, someone on the other side is doing the same thing.

2014
01:24:35.76 --> 01:24:44.76
Doing the same thing, but we're human, you know, there was that connection, that we as soldiers are fighting these wars for other people's ideologies,

2015
01:24:44.76 --> 01:24:48.76
and if they'd have left us alone, we would have been best friends.

2016
01:24:48.76 --> 01:24:54.76
So when I got out of the fire department, guys are playing, oh, you got to remember where you're from, you know, all this bullshit,

2017
01:24:54.76 --> 01:25:05.76
and I'm like, did you ever kill a commie from mommy, mother, you know, like, no, you know, there's a whole thing about how I fit into the fire department,

2018
01:25:05.76 --> 01:25:15.76
but I would tell them, I've killed a better man than you, and meaning it, because that guy and I would have been friends.

2019
01:25:15.76 --> 01:25:25.76
We laughed, we drank, we smoked cigarettes, and when we left, we felt sad that it wasn't going to work,

2020
01:25:25.76 --> 01:25:36.76
and then you meet them on… this is a small world, man, you know, and my heart broke that day, you know,

2021
01:25:36.76 --> 01:25:44.76
and I told this story to my grandson, and he put it in a poem, but he said, and his heart was crushed,

2022
01:25:44.76 --> 01:25:58.76
and that was hard, you know, other than getting connected. There was a guy named Tic, a Vietnamese guy, our point man.

2023
01:25:58.76 --> 01:26:03.76
We got jacked up one time, he said, yes, me, he said, let's go, we go kill communists.

2024
01:26:03.76 --> 01:26:18.76
So let's go, buzzed. We went out, we set up on a river, waiting, nothing happened to the world that could ever see,

2025
01:26:18.76 --> 01:26:26.76
but him sitting beside me, right, and thinking, okay, we're going to war, and if it happens, we are together.

2026
01:26:26.76 --> 01:26:36.76
I didn't say a word, but the connection, the spiritual connection, the blending of us as warriors, you can't buy that shit.

2027
01:26:36.76 --> 01:26:43.76
You can't create it, you can't form it. It exists in a spiritual sense, you know.

2028
01:26:43.76 --> 01:26:50.76
Let's go back to just to cover this part of your history to when you graduated BUDs,

2029
01:26:50.76 --> 01:26:57.76
because you mentioned it, but you didn't go into too much detail about that. You were one of the few guys that got selected to go straight to

2030
01:26:57.76 --> 01:27:06.76
SEAL Team, SEAL Team 1 without going to UDT. At the time, the normal procedure was guys graduate BUDs,

2031
01:27:06.76 --> 01:27:13.76
they go to UDT, the underwater demolition teams, they do deployments there, and then they can volunteer to go over to SEAL Team,

2032
01:27:13.76 --> 01:27:18.76
which is going to be more land based, still foot in the water, but going to be more land based,

2033
01:27:18.76 --> 01:27:22.76
and you went straight to, you got to order straight to SEAL Team 1.

2034
01:27:22.76 --> 01:27:25.76
Why do you think that was?

2035
01:27:25.76 --> 01:27:34.76
Well, Captain Shibull, not actually, Captain Anderson was the commander when we were selected.

2036
01:27:34.76 --> 01:27:41.76
He actually lives in Ignacio, New Mexico, no, Colorado.

2037
01:27:41.76 --> 01:27:51.76
When you get together, he says, yeah, Espinoza says I picked you, you, and Czakowski, and he knows all the names, right?

2038
01:27:51.76 --> 01:28:01.76
I said, what was with that? He says, we weren't getting the guys that were volunteering from UDT because we were getting shot up.

2039
01:28:01.76 --> 01:28:08.76
I mean, and I think even Roger Hayden, that's why Roger, I mean, he got shot up except in UDT.

2040
01:28:08.76 --> 01:28:13.76
And he goes, he said, I want to get my ass shot if you're doing UDT.

2041
01:28:13.76 --> 01:28:15.76
I want to go into SEAL Team and figure this shit out.

2042
01:28:15.76 --> 01:28:22.76
If we're going to, if we're UDT guys are going to be running SEAL Ops, I want to know what I need to know to do that.

2043
01:28:22.76 --> 01:28:31.76
And so the whole switch-up in operations from the water work to the land, the guerrilla warfare, right?

2044
01:28:31.76 --> 01:28:39.76
UDT, all the water work, explosives up to the berm line, and then we're from the hinterline in as far as we can go.

2045
01:28:39.76 --> 01:28:44.76
Now, you guys, you're going in big, all huge helicopters taking them.

2046
01:28:44.76 --> 01:28:50.76
I'm going, hell no, man. I'd rather be in the jungle, you know, just, and they weren't getting them.

2047
01:28:50.76 --> 01:28:59.76
And so what he did is he had the instructors start hand-selecting guys that they think could transition.

2048
01:28:59.76 --> 01:29:11.76
And then they took the volunteers, they took the volunteers, UDT guys, and it's really, God, you know, the way things work out.

2049
01:29:11.76 --> 01:29:19.76
Guys like from 38 and 39 are marrying up with guys from 42 and 41, right?

2050
01:29:19.76 --> 01:29:26.76
So a lot of the guys in those classes, like Crawford, right, he was part of the dirty dozen, right?

2051
01:29:26.76 --> 01:29:32.76
And his instructor was, one of our instructors was Barry Enoch, right?

2052
01:29:32.76 --> 01:29:43.76
And then some of the guys that were with him, too, were out of class 38 and 39, and the guys that I operated with, like Hyatt and Richards and the DeAngelo, they're from 38 and 39, right?

2053
01:29:43.76 --> 01:29:54.76
So this whole group, when you talk about only 150 guys, I mean, they were making multiple truers.

2054
01:29:54.76 --> 01:29:58.76
I had made two, but I broke my leg in a platoon workup, right?

2055
01:29:58.76 --> 01:30:10.76
And I about cried. I did cry because I was in Balboa Hospital and it felt like that damn hell week when the guys were going around in the paddle, you know, and going to finish the hell week. I'm not going.

2056
01:30:10.76 --> 01:30:16.76
That's what I'm going to do. That's what I want to do. And there were no doubts.

2057
01:30:16.76 --> 01:30:23.76
And I think if you had the doubt, and I don't know how guys work now, if you have any doubt, you don't belong going, you know?

2058
01:30:23.76 --> 01:30:28.76
I told guys on the fire department, you don't want to do everything, take off the damn Maltese.

2059
01:30:28.76 --> 01:30:37.76
And all we had was the little gold wings, but I remember Chief Stahl, we're going through SEAL training, SEAL Cadrate, right? We're out there in Nile.

2060
01:30:37.76 --> 01:30:43.76
We lived in boxcars. There was only two girls in the bar. That place was Lunarface and Craterface.

2061
01:30:43.76 --> 01:30:48.76
And everybody was hot on them, and they make them feel like queens, you know?

2062
01:30:48.76 --> 01:30:57.76
Well, the Desert Boys didn't like that. So one day, like, eight of the Desert Boys came down and there was a tuxel in the bar, right?

2063
01:30:57.76 --> 01:31:05.76
I don't know where Chief Stahl, he's a little guy like me. He's a Korea guy. He is a Korea guy, but also a raider.

2064
01:31:05.76 --> 01:31:14.76
The Army Raider guys, right? Ranger, whatever, you know, because there were the Green Beret guys, but there were also the Rangers.

2065
01:31:14.76 --> 01:31:20.76
And I'm sitting there with my little beard, you know, the guys are all laughing and everything, and he comes in there.

2066
01:31:20.76 --> 01:31:28.76
God damn it! He says, you are at first, and he's the guy, he's the guy when we're standing, going through training, he goes,

2067
01:31:28.76 --> 01:31:39.76
yeah, I want two rows of corn here. Two rows of corn here. I want my M16 man over here, my M16 here, my Grenadiers over here, my Stoner man,

2068
01:31:39.76 --> 01:31:49.76
and the officers with your M16s, I want you assigned, right? He said, when that left foot hits, you got the M16, I want the TUT.

2069
01:31:49.76 --> 01:31:55.76
He says, and if you're on the M16, you want, you want, you want, you want. So you Stoners, I want some singing.

2070
01:31:55.76 --> 01:32:02.76
He says, and the officer, everyone's got boom, and then you Grenadiers, I want you every fourth time you're left foot hit, I want boom.

2071
01:32:02.76 --> 01:32:11.76
You understand? You're all like, yeah, we understand. So he said, be honest, okay, let's move. You know, we're like a rock and roll man, man.

2072
01:32:11.76 --> 01:32:17.76
But really looking at the rate of fire, you know, and the intensity of it, right?

2073
01:32:17.76 --> 01:32:27.76
So we were trained in that small group of what it felt like to be powerful, powerful, invincible, right?

2074
01:32:27.76 --> 01:32:33.76
And so they would grab the guys from UDT, they would marry us up into this Seal Cadbury class.

2075
01:32:33.76 --> 01:32:42.76
And there's a book Vietnam Seals or whatever in Vietnam. And my cousin found the book at Annapolis, she went to Annapolis.

2076
01:32:42.76 --> 01:32:47.76
And you can see up there, it says, SB and Moe, the boat, how they were assigned, and they're doing the instruction.

2077
01:32:47.76 --> 01:32:55.76
That's how basic it was, you know, because they weren't getting guys to do it.

2078
01:32:55.76 --> 01:33:00.76
So he wanted, and I think that was the beginning of transitioning the UDT teams.

2079
01:33:00.76 --> 01:33:05.76
I mean, the kids that are going through Bud's now, and just saying, well, we can save this time.

2080
01:33:05.76 --> 01:33:12.76
Because we, when we went to jump school, Seals, right? The UDT guys had already gone through jump school.

2081
01:33:12.76 --> 01:33:17.76
But those of us who were in, they went through the Seal Cadbury that hadn't done that trip weren't airborne yet.

2082
01:33:17.76 --> 01:33:22.76
So we go to jump school. And we were in shape, man.

2083
01:33:22.76 --> 01:33:26.76
So we were out there doing the run around. We ran at least three or four guys into the dirt.

2084
01:33:26.76 --> 01:33:30.76
You know, they sit there, they get your 10 chin-ups, and I'd do 140 Army.

2085
01:33:30.76 --> 01:33:34.76
And I could do 50 of them at that time. Because I was a little guy, right?

2086
01:33:34.76 --> 01:33:38.76
140 Army, 140 Navy, 140 Marines. Oh yeah, smartass, give me a couple more.

2087
01:33:38.76 --> 01:33:41.76
And I'd get all of you up to about 47, 45.

2088
01:33:41.76 --> 01:33:44.76
And then I'd yell, instead of yelling who-yod, yell airborne.

2089
01:33:44.76 --> 01:33:47.76
You know, airborne and sergeant, you know.

2090
01:33:47.76 --> 01:33:50.76
And they didn't know who we were.

2091
01:33:50.76 --> 01:33:54.76
I don't know what the other thing was so cool about being a- they didn't know who we were.

2092
01:33:54.76 --> 01:34:00.76
We, uh, matter of fact, me and my partner, uh, we were in-

2093
01:34:00.76 --> 01:34:05.76
We went in, we quit- we didn't talk to anybody, right? Didn't talk to any of the Army guys, you know.

2094
01:34:05.76 --> 01:34:08.76
Is that Airborne School? Airborne School, yeah. We didn't talk to anybody.

2095
01:34:08.76 --> 01:34:11.76
And they assigned guys to put us up into this barracks where we were at.

2096
01:34:11.76 --> 01:34:15.76
So who are you guys? Where you from?

2097
01:34:15.76 --> 01:34:20.76
Just walk away. Just, hey, come on, man. You guys talk.

2098
01:34:20.76 --> 01:34:23.76
Talk to each one of us. Everybody just don't say anything.

2099
01:34:23.76 --> 01:34:28.76
And you know, and then we turn our head and we're like, you know, just playing that, whatever that role is.

2100
01:34:28.76 --> 01:34:32.76
But nobody had to tell you. It just happened.

2101
01:34:32.76 --> 01:34:35.76
It was just like everybody would pick up on the energy of everybody else.

2102
01:34:35.76 --> 01:34:39.76
That's the other thing that's created in the training class.

2103
01:34:39.76 --> 01:34:42.76
You can see him.

2104
01:34:42.76 --> 01:34:45.76
There's a group of kids from team eight when I went to a golf tournament.

2105
01:34:45.76 --> 01:34:48.76
I can see when they came in, they're all picking up on the energy of each other.

2106
01:34:48.76 --> 01:34:51.76
All wearing shirts that they got from Walmart.

2107
01:34:51.76 --> 01:34:55.76
One has a cat, one has a bird, you know, wearing their flip flops.

2108
01:34:55.76 --> 01:34:59.76
I mean, that whole- they're so out of uniform that they're in uniform. Does that make sense?

2109
01:34:59.76 --> 01:35:00.76
Yeah.

2110
01:35:00.76 --> 01:35:07.76
You can tell who a frogman is by the stuff that he doesn't wear to- not conform, but he is conform.

2111
01:35:07.76 --> 01:35:14.76
Right? So, you know, it, but anyway, back to Chief Stone.

2112
01:35:14.76 --> 01:35:19.76
He yelled at us, you sons of bitches are living on the reputation of dead men.

2113
01:35:19.76 --> 01:35:25.76
Get all the money you got out of your pockets, leave it for them, and I'll meet you back at the area.

2114
01:35:25.76 --> 01:35:29.76
And then we just had a big old hole in the earth that we threw wood into the island.

2115
01:35:29.76 --> 01:35:36.76
We built a fire and then you sleep in these box cars with these springs and you put your bed in there.

2116
01:35:36.76 --> 01:35:41.76
Like a mummy thing. And we wake up in the morning, there's a damn snake in there with you, you know.

2117
01:35:41.76 --> 01:35:45.76
And, but that night we operated all night long.

2118
01:35:45.76 --> 01:35:49.76
I mean, it was, it was kind of like a, almost like a two-day off all night, the all night thing.

2119
01:35:49.76 --> 01:35:54.76
We're no sleep. And you were glad that you went through Hell Week because you could operate like that.

2120
01:35:54.76 --> 01:36:02.76
You could, you could do that. And, and, and he never scolded us after that.

2121
01:36:02.76 --> 01:36:07.76
He only told us, some of the bitches are living on reputation of dead men, made us hurt.

2122
01:36:07.76 --> 01:36:14.76
And he says, you're not seals yet. I understood it. You're not seals yet.

2123
01:36:14.76 --> 01:36:21.76
So I finished Seal Cadbury, right? Those of us who made it through and Marcia and Mackintosh, hey, I'll meet you at the trade winds, trade wind bar.

2124
01:36:21.76 --> 01:36:29.76
That's where we all hang out, right? I said, all right. So we, we show up, we show up there and the night before, I'm going to meet them next to the night before,

2125
01:36:29.76 --> 01:36:36.76
I'm sitting there and I have me a beer and the lady comes up, sits beside me and she sits right beside me.

2126
01:36:36.76 --> 01:36:45.76
And I'm like, you one of those FNGs? I'm like, I don't know.

2127
01:36:45.76 --> 01:36:52.76
I want some nap. She says FNG. I don't know what that is. It's a fucking new guy.

2128
01:36:52.76 --> 01:37:02.76
I'm like, well, yeah, I guess I got my Rolex, right? I got my Rolex. Yeah, I'm almost a new guy. I got my Rolex.

2129
01:37:02.76 --> 01:37:13.76
Well, I'm Chief Gustavus' wife. Someone tell you something. I can outdream you. I can out fight you. And I can out eff you.

2130
01:37:13.76 --> 01:37:25.76
I'm like, oh, man, can I, can I buy you a beer? The Chief's wife. And I'm 20 years old, I'm sneaking into the bar, right?

2131
01:37:25.76 --> 01:37:33.76
And so she says FNA, right? Right? So I, you can have mine. I just got it.

2132
01:37:33.76 --> 01:37:43.76
But anyway, she says, I'm going to tell you something. She says the Chief has three tours of Vietnam. He's never been hurt. Never got anybody killed.

2133
01:37:43.76 --> 01:37:49.76
He says, we lost a couple guys. And I think by that time FUNC had gotten, all the guys that got killed were on stupid shit.

2134
01:37:49.76 --> 01:37:55.76
Like FUNC, they had him, had him tied and they were going to show these senators how we do stuff when we capture people.

2135
01:37:55.76 --> 01:38:04.76
They were on a boat broached. He went into the river, found him four or five days later. And the way the water runs is so dark and the current killed him.

2136
01:38:04.76 --> 01:38:11.76
Right? We kill our own for stupid shit. Our guy's drilling it out in a two millimeter mortar and it kills guys.

2137
01:38:11.76 --> 01:38:17.76
Mike Corman, they went to Vietnam with this. He switched out with a guy that was a regular Corman that was with Marines.

2138
01:38:17.76 --> 01:38:26.76
He switched out with him so he could, this other guy could get his pay. Right? And Doc Maynard's walking with another guy that goes off.

2139
01:38:26.76 --> 01:38:34.76
They're walking by and kills both of them. A guy named Van Hoy who had like, he wrote to everybody, man, he had his shit together. Right?

2140
01:38:34.76 --> 01:38:44.76
Doc Maynard, that's how you lose guys, right? But I lost track.

2141
01:38:44.76 --> 01:38:56.76
So what did she tell you? So she told me, she said, yeah, thank you. So don't get him killed. And if you don't want to do this job, if you don't know what you're going to go, and this is where I'm a wife.

2142
01:38:56.76 --> 01:39:05.76
Right? And sometimes I guess my understanding is some of the wives take on the personality of the officer's wives, start their little stuff.

2143
01:39:05.76 --> 01:39:16.76
You know, my daughter is the wife of an officer, Marine Corps officer. And she let me know the human piece, right? This is a family.

2144
01:39:16.76 --> 01:39:23.76
I mean, she, they have their family. This is what it means to her. And I'm responsible for myself to make sure he doesn't get killed.

2145
01:39:23.76 --> 01:39:34.76
And I have to learn that stuff, not just for me. And I understood that sometimes in the teams, I don't want to let anybody down, right?

2146
01:39:34.76 --> 01:39:42.76
It isn't that at all. If I could do anything like that, and then you let yourself down, and I have, I mean, I'm not sinless, you know.

2147
01:39:42.76 --> 01:39:54.76
But I know that when I come to that point where I do something I don't want to do, and don't do the things that I should do, the greatest disappointment is me, because I don't have power over that.

2148
01:39:54.76 --> 01:40:07.76
Or I chose to do whatever I did. And so I looked at her and I went, no, man. I said, if I, if I, I don't know what I'm going, I mean, I just graduated to seal training.

2149
01:40:07.76 --> 01:40:16.76
I don't know where I'm going. I said, I promise, and Chief Gustav was a cool dude, you know, he was a good operator and everything. So I got that.

2150
01:40:16.76 --> 01:40:25.76
So next day, I told Macintosh Garcia, I said, well, I'll meet you, you know, all right. You know, so we get together. And it was early in the day.

2151
01:40:25.76 --> 01:40:28.76
And you never, there was a trade wind bar when you went.

2152
01:40:28.76 --> 01:40:29.76
Was it an IB?

2153
01:40:29.76 --> 01:40:34.76
No, it was, it was right. This was a little, it's on Orange Avenue.

2154
01:40:34.76 --> 01:40:35.76
Yeah, no.

2155
01:40:35.76 --> 01:40:39.76
Down from McPee's between Danny and McPee's is where the ice cream place is.

2156
01:40:39.76 --> 01:40:40.76
Yeah, no, it was gone.

2157
01:40:40.76 --> 01:40:54.76
But anyway, it had swinging doors. You walk in there, you walk in and a lot of a lot of character and a lot of who we were as the, not just the operational piece, but the interpersonal piece, right?

2158
01:40:54.76 --> 01:41:08.76
So we walk into this place swinging doors and we look down and there's this guy got John his mouth and smoking cigar by the bathroom and you weren't sure whether he was the bathroom had a problem with plumbing or whether it was him.

2159
01:41:08.76 --> 01:41:14.76
He's eating boiled eggs and drinking beer and he went to the head and he was like, huh, and he had a full growth.

2160
01:41:14.76 --> 01:41:19.76
And I'll just, the guys and those guys in the team will know that it was tobacco, right?

2161
01:41:19.76 --> 01:41:21.76
Because he had a lot of tobacco.

2162
01:41:21.76 --> 01:41:25.76
So he looks down at us and me, Macintosh and Garcia.

2163
01:41:25.76 --> 01:41:30.76
And so I said, Hey, you guys the FNGs?

2164
01:41:30.76 --> 01:41:31.76
I already knew who I was.

2165
01:41:31.76 --> 01:41:42.76
I was going to say, yeah, he says, that's all we need in the teams is more FNNs, Mexicans and Ns.

2166
01:41:42.76 --> 01:41:46.76
So I was like, who?

2167
01:41:46.76 --> 01:41:52.76
Yeah, you know, so we just looked at each other.

2168
01:41:52.76 --> 01:41:55.76
But the cool piece about it, we already knew who we were.

2169
01:41:55.76 --> 01:41:57.76
Chief Allen already established it for us.

2170
01:41:57.76 --> 01:42:06.76
All of our already established it for us. I don't know who this cat is, but he's an operator and he has every right to say whatever he wants to say to me because I've done anything.

2171
01:42:06.76 --> 01:42:07.76
Right?

2172
01:42:07.76 --> 01:42:11.76
So I missed my first platoon. I go over, do my trip, do my Vietnam thing.

2173
01:42:11.76 --> 01:42:16.76
Well, what happened on your, you broke your leg in your first workup?

2174
01:42:16.76 --> 01:42:18.76
Were you parachuting or what were you doing?

2175
01:42:18.76 --> 01:42:20.76
How do I tell everybody?

2176
01:42:20.76 --> 01:42:28.76
I was parachuting and repelling was one of the other things. When I got to Balboa Hospital, it was like, how'd you do that?

2177
01:42:28.76 --> 01:42:31.76
Well, sure, I was repelling.

2178
01:42:31.76 --> 01:42:34.76
How far away from deployment were you?

2179
01:42:34.76 --> 01:42:35.76
Two weeks.

2180
01:42:35.76 --> 01:42:37.76
Oh, two weeks.

2181
01:42:37.76 --> 01:42:38.76
Getting ready to go on deployment. What happened?

2182
01:42:38.76 --> 01:42:42.76
So what we did, what we were doing was doing a compass course, right?

2183
01:42:42.76 --> 01:42:48.76
Alpha Brown, you had these different legs and we went by ourselves like about four minutes behind each other.

2184
01:42:48.76 --> 01:42:50.76
So we'd cover each other right?

2185
01:42:50.76 --> 01:42:54.76
We didn't go in pairs. We went singles.

2186
01:42:54.76 --> 01:42:57.76
And so I'm, this is like a 10 mile deal, right?

2187
01:42:57.76 --> 01:43:06.76
So I'm up on this rock and I'm looking thinking, oh, shit, I got another, I don't know, maybe a mile to go down this other rock.

2188
01:43:06.76 --> 01:43:10.76
I have my black face on, I have all my stuff. I've got my weapon in this hand.

2189
01:43:10.76 --> 01:43:15.76
I've got my compasses and everything and I'm looking and here comes a guy on a horse.

2190
01:43:15.76 --> 01:43:18.76
He says, hey, how you doing? This is good. How you doing?

2191
01:43:18.76 --> 01:43:21.76
He says, don't find something. I've done a nice ride today.

2192
01:43:21.76 --> 01:43:26.76
I said, oh, light, cheat, steal, do whatever you can to get through, but don't get caught, right?

2193
01:43:26.76 --> 01:43:29.76
I said, you don't happen to be going by that rock down there.

2194
01:43:29.76 --> 01:43:31.76
He says, I'm going right by that rock.

2195
01:43:31.76 --> 01:43:34.76
I said, how about a ride? He says, sure.

2196
01:43:34.76 --> 01:43:39.76
So I get ready to shift my, you know, my hands over to a weapon to reach up to grab me.

2197
01:43:39.76 --> 01:43:41.76
He goes, oh, no, he says, you're a little enough.

2198
01:43:41.76 --> 01:43:43.76
He says, I'll just pull you up.

2199
01:43:43.76 --> 01:43:46.76
I said, all right. So I put my foot, put my foot.

2200
01:43:46.76 --> 01:43:50.76
That's the other thing you learn is don't let anybody else have control over your shit.

2201
01:43:50.76 --> 01:43:54.76
Right? You just don't, don't do it. You got to do your own stuff.

2202
01:43:54.76 --> 01:43:57.76
So he reaches down, grabs hold me, slings me up.

2203
01:43:57.76 --> 01:44:00.76
Next thing he falls sideways.

2204
01:44:00.76 --> 01:44:05.76
So he lets loose in my hand. So I take my hand and I grab up like this and I grab hold the saddle.

2205
01:44:05.76 --> 01:44:09.76
Have my weapon here and I stick on this side. That horse takes off.

2206
01:44:09.76 --> 01:44:14.76
Oh, no. Next thing I'm running next, he's like, oh, this thing in my leg.

2207
01:44:14.76 --> 01:44:18.76
I look at my feet. They're both above my heads.

2208
01:44:18.76 --> 01:44:20.76
I have my maps here and have my weapon here.

2209
01:44:20.76 --> 01:44:24.76
And when I hit, it was like, I went, oh, shit.

2210
01:44:24.76 --> 01:44:27.76
So he scampers off. Then he comes back. You okay?

2211
01:44:27.76 --> 01:44:30.76
I said, no, man, I don't think I am.

2212
01:44:30.76 --> 01:44:36.76
He gets off his horse and he said, well, let me get his little bag and he cuts my laces off and looks at my leg.

2213
01:44:36.76 --> 01:44:42.76
And then I took my little 38 I had, you know, hand weapon.

2214
01:44:42.76 --> 01:44:45.76
Doc Maynard was my corpsman, right? He's when you swapped out.

2215
01:44:45.76 --> 01:44:48.76
He's the guy who got killed. Doc Maynard comes down.

2216
01:44:48.76 --> 01:44:52.76
And by that time, another guy comes by on a horse and he says, what's going on?

2217
01:44:52.76 --> 01:44:54.76
He says, I think this guy's got a fraction of a lelious.

2218
01:44:54.76 --> 01:44:56.76
You know, it looks like a disulfillabila break.

2219
01:44:56.76 --> 01:44:59.76
He's got pitopulse and I didn't know what any of that stuff was.

2220
01:44:59.76 --> 01:45:02.76
I'm just a soldier, man.

2221
01:45:02.76 --> 01:45:07.76
And so I said, so what's going on? How do you guys know this?

2222
01:45:07.76 --> 01:45:10.76
Oh, we're doctors. We're up here on the little, I said, no.

2223
01:45:10.76 --> 01:45:15.76
And so they split it and everything by the time Doc got there, I was already squirt away.

2224
01:45:15.76 --> 01:45:19.76
He says, you have any drugs? I said, no, we don't have any drugs.

2225
01:45:19.76 --> 01:45:22.76
He would give morphine, but then with the morphine shred, he always had to do the doc.

2226
01:45:22.76 --> 01:45:27.76
He didn't want to do that. And so the doc said, well, here, and he gives me a pint of peach brandy.

2227
01:45:27.76 --> 01:45:32.76
He says, drink this. Got in a little Jeep that the doc gave me.

2228
01:45:32.76 --> 01:45:35.76
This kind of kept track of us.

2229
01:45:35.76 --> 01:45:38.76
By the time I got to Balboa, man, I was jacked up.

2230
01:45:38.76 --> 01:45:41.76
You know, so they had to wait, give me a block.

2231
01:45:41.76 --> 01:45:46.76
And so then my platoon came because I was in the hospital and they all gave me a kiss goodbye, man.

2232
01:45:46.76 --> 01:45:53.76
And this guy, Alan, took my job and I hated him.

2233
01:45:53.76 --> 01:45:59.76
I was so envious and so hurt and so pissed off that he's got my job with my platoon and in that platoon,

2234
01:45:59.76 --> 01:46:03.76
I with me, Hodge, me, Hodge, and I were the point man in that platoon, right?

2235
01:46:03.76 --> 01:46:05.76
And I wanted, I wanted to go work.

2236
01:46:05.76 --> 01:46:12.76
So that means I had to stand down again and all these guys that I was with, right?

2237
01:46:12.76 --> 01:46:15.76
So then I had to do, it took me two months, right?

2238
01:46:15.76 --> 01:46:21.76
So I'm in Balboa Hospital. I got my foot up like this, his CLT monitor once they found out who I was.

2239
01:46:21.76 --> 01:46:24.76
Guys from K-Son were coming in, they were shot, jacked up, man.

2240
01:46:24.76 --> 01:46:31.76
I'm sitting there watching them come in and they put this guy beside me and this little machine is going in.

2241
01:46:31.76 --> 01:46:33.76
I mean, people were jacked up.

2242
01:46:33.76 --> 01:46:38.76
I saw a war from that. I saw the damage.

2243
01:46:38.76 --> 01:46:42.76
This machine goes off, stops, a little light.

2244
01:46:42.76 --> 01:46:47.76
So I pushed the button, started back up again.

2245
01:46:47.76 --> 01:46:53.76
So it happened about four times. It was like in the middle of the night. I pushed this button by myself.

2246
01:46:53.76 --> 01:46:59.76
My team's gone and pulled the cord for the corpsman. He doesn't show up.

2247
01:46:59.76 --> 01:47:02.76
Finally, when he does show up, I said, what do you, what do you need?

2248
01:47:02.76 --> 01:47:03.76
I said, what's this?

2249
01:47:03.76 --> 01:47:05.76
It went off. He went, what did you do?

2250
01:47:05.76 --> 01:47:08.76
What did this happen? I said, I've been for four hours, right?

2251
01:47:08.76 --> 01:47:10.76
So he grabs him, takes off.

2252
01:47:10.76 --> 01:47:13.76
Then he comes back. This guy comes back about two days later.

2253
01:47:13.76 --> 01:47:19.76
He's a Marine. He's got a patch on his eyes, legs jacked up and he's got wounds in here.

2254
01:47:19.76 --> 01:47:24.76
He looks at me and says, you're the guy who's pushing the button?

2255
01:47:24.76 --> 01:47:26.76
Oh yeah. Yeah.

2256
01:47:26.76 --> 01:47:31.76
He said, I was drowning.

2257
01:47:31.76 --> 01:47:33.76
This is when the button would go off.

2258
01:47:33.76 --> 01:47:35.76
He says, I would start drowning.

2259
01:47:35.76 --> 01:47:38.76
He says, you pushed the button and sucked that stuff out of my lungs.

2260
01:47:38.76 --> 01:47:42.76
So he and I became good friends and I was only there for another.

2261
01:47:42.76 --> 01:47:44.76
I went back and checked him out.

2262
01:47:44.76 --> 01:47:48.76
Later on, he had like a floppy leg and his eyes missing.

2263
01:47:48.76 --> 01:47:51.76
When I went back and saw him, he says, how are you doing?

2264
01:47:51.76 --> 01:47:52.76
He said, I'm doing great, man.

2265
01:47:52.76 --> 01:47:55.76
I said, someone's going to send me to MCRD.

2266
01:47:55.76 --> 01:47:56.76
I said, really?

2267
01:47:56.76 --> 01:47:58.76
Marine Corps Recruiting Station, right?

2268
01:47:58.76 --> 01:47:59.76
He's going to receive troops.

2269
01:47:59.76 --> 01:48:00.76
He says, yeah.

2270
01:48:00.76 --> 01:48:01.76
He says, check this out.

2271
01:48:01.76 --> 01:48:03.76
He's got his patch on his eye and goes like this.

2272
01:48:03.76 --> 01:48:05.76
Marine Corps emblem inside his eye.

2273
01:48:05.76 --> 01:48:07.76
He says, I'll be receiving those guys.

2274
01:48:07.76 --> 01:48:09.76
He says, look me in the eye, boy.

2275
01:48:09.76 --> 01:48:12.76
So he was a cool guy.

2276
01:48:12.76 --> 01:48:15.76
So yeah, I miss my platoon.

2277
01:48:15.76 --> 01:48:19.76
And so then when I'm there, I have a SEAL team one on there and this guy comes walking in.

2278
01:48:19.76 --> 01:48:22.76
Got his Rolex, got his ball cap.

2279
01:48:22.76 --> 01:48:24.76
And I look, he's cocking on jump boots and shit.

2280
01:48:24.76 --> 01:48:26.76
I'm going, oh, it's a team guy.

2281
01:48:26.76 --> 01:48:29.76
So I said, hey man, I was at the G-Dunk with the CBE.

2282
01:48:29.76 --> 01:48:30.76
This is at the hospital?

2283
01:48:30.76 --> 01:48:31.76
At the hospital.

2284
01:48:31.76 --> 01:48:35.76
I said, I look at this guy and I say, hey man, is you in the teams?

2285
01:48:35.76 --> 01:48:37.76
He says, yeah.

2286
01:48:37.76 --> 01:48:38.76
I said, so am I.

2287
01:48:38.76 --> 01:48:41.76
He goes, so what the fuck?

2288
01:48:41.76 --> 01:48:42.76
And walks out.

2289
01:48:42.76 --> 01:48:47.76
So I'm like, are you rude son of a bitch?

2290
01:48:47.76 --> 01:48:50.76
You know, I mean, I'm pissed off.

2291
01:48:50.76 --> 01:48:53.76
So I bet did about another month there.

2292
01:48:53.76 --> 01:48:54.76
And then I left, right?

2293
01:48:54.76 --> 01:48:55.76
Went back to the SEAL team.

2294
01:48:55.76 --> 01:48:57.76
I said, okay, SP, you're back.

2295
01:48:57.76 --> 01:48:59.76
Here, lockers 69.

2296
01:48:59.76 --> 01:49:02.76
Go take it and change, put your new gear and stuff.

2297
01:49:02.76 --> 01:49:03.76
I said, all right.

2298
01:49:03.76 --> 01:49:05.76
So I go over there and I look at the lockers.

2299
01:49:05.76 --> 01:49:07.76
They were like this.

2300
01:49:07.76 --> 01:49:11.76
And like these spaces here and there was a window at the end and mine was at the end.

2301
01:49:11.76 --> 01:49:13.76
So I go over there and I look.

2302
01:49:13.76 --> 01:49:16.76
There was, when I go in, I walk by the lockers.

2303
01:49:16.76 --> 01:49:20.76
There's that guy that told me, so what the fuck?

2304
01:49:20.76 --> 01:49:21.76
So I walk by him.

2305
01:49:21.76 --> 01:49:22.76
He just kind of licks at me.

2306
01:49:22.76 --> 01:49:25.76
I don't know if you, you know, it just kind of looked at me.

2307
01:49:25.76 --> 01:49:27.76
I kind of looked at him and I went and there's a name up there.

2308
01:49:27.76 --> 01:49:31.76
So I grabbed it, pulled it off and I threw it in the shit can.

2309
01:49:31.76 --> 01:49:34.76
And he goes, that was a good man.

2310
01:49:34.76 --> 01:49:37.76
I said, so what the fuck?

2311
01:49:37.76 --> 01:49:41.76
He looked at me, man, and it was like, we're going to dance.

2312
01:49:41.76 --> 01:49:43.76
You know, we're going to dance.

2313
01:49:43.76 --> 01:49:48.76
And I backed up into the corner and he just looked at me and he goes, fuck you.

2314
01:49:48.76 --> 01:49:53.76
Turns around walks out and I went, wow, that was pretty intense, you know.

2315
01:49:53.76 --> 01:49:58.76
And so then we go out and they said, okay, we're going to start signing the patoons.

2316
01:49:58.76 --> 01:50:01.76
Alpha Bravo dot char echo, patoon, right?

2317
01:50:01.76 --> 01:50:06.76
So they started naming names echo, patoon, despinoza, I'm going, oh, man, that's cool.

2318
01:50:06.76 --> 01:50:11.76
So it goes on to, to, to, to, to, to, and then they call that guy's name.

2319
01:50:11.76 --> 01:50:13.76
He comes walking to my patoon.

2320
01:50:13.76 --> 01:50:17.76
I'm going, oh, you guys are both an echo platoon, both of us an echo platoon.

2321
01:50:17.76 --> 01:50:20.76
And I pulled that name tag and threw it off.

2322
01:50:20.76 --> 01:50:27.76
Then later on, I found out that he was with a guy named Anton that had gotten killed in a firefight.

2323
01:50:27.76 --> 01:50:32.76
They McGuire rigged him out, he got hit two times.

2324
01:50:32.76 --> 01:50:39.76
They ran, they went on two helicopters to an op and they dropped everybody off.

2325
01:50:39.76 --> 01:50:41.76
So they were patrolling.

2326
01:50:41.76 --> 01:50:48.76
They took Anton and moved him up forward and never really was never really a point man, right?

2327
01:50:48.76 --> 01:50:53.76
But they hadn't moved him up out of, out of his out of where they normally does.

2328
01:50:53.76 --> 01:51:00.76
He stepped out and in a jungle, there's a lot of times you, you just step out and it's a base camp, right?

2329
01:51:00.76 --> 01:51:04.76
And, and if you're not really quiet, they know you're coming.

2330
01:51:04.76 --> 01:51:07.76
And so he stepped out, they got engaged.

2331
01:51:07.76 --> 01:51:14.76
He got shot, killed the two Vietnamese, another American and two guys wounded.

2332
01:51:14.76 --> 01:51:18.76
I'm going to talk to my, my partner and I learned about this.

2333
01:51:18.76 --> 01:51:22.76
So that was what the op was, right?

2334
01:51:22.76 --> 01:51:30.76
So I didn't know that Anton had gotten killed and then I understood what had happened.

2335
01:51:30.76 --> 01:51:35.76
We were in the San Platoon for three months and didn't talk to each other.

2336
01:51:35.76 --> 01:51:37.76
I didn't talk to him. He didn't talk to me.

2337
01:51:37.76 --> 01:51:43.76
We'd look, we'd work and do stuff and there was like the visual connection about what we're doing.

2338
01:51:43.76 --> 01:51:49.76
But it was like hard.

2339
01:51:49.76 --> 01:52:00.76
It was hard. I'm not going to, it was like, I don't know, like two invisible forces that had no way to communicate.

2340
01:52:00.76 --> 01:52:03.76
It was like a big wall, you know, and it went down.

2341
01:52:03.76 --> 01:52:09.76
I'm walking to the trade winds to go to the trade winds to have a beer and he pulls by in his car.

2342
01:52:09.76 --> 01:52:12.76
Reason he was in there because he got drunk and broke out his teeth.

2343
01:52:12.76 --> 01:52:14.76
That's why he was there.

2344
01:52:14.76 --> 01:52:17.76
And the only words he ever said, Espy.

2345
01:52:17.76 --> 01:52:21.76
Yeah, he says, uh, where are you going?

2346
01:52:21.76 --> 01:52:23.76
I said, I'm going to the trade wind.

2347
01:52:23.76 --> 01:52:25.76
You want to ride?

2348
01:52:25.76 --> 01:52:27.76
I said, I hate walking, man.

2349
01:52:27.76 --> 01:52:29.76
I said, yeah.

2350
01:52:29.76 --> 01:52:33.76
So I get in there, didn't say a word. We drove up to the bar, right?

2351
01:52:33.76 --> 01:52:36.76
Parked right in front. We get in. There's nobody in there.

2352
01:52:36.76 --> 01:52:37.76
Right?

2353
01:52:37.76 --> 01:52:39.76
Well, except for tobacco Lewis.

2354
01:52:39.76 --> 01:52:41.76
No, we tobacco, right?

2355
01:52:41.76 --> 01:52:43.76
The guy, I'll tell you about, I'm kind of digressing.

2356
01:52:43.76 --> 01:52:47.76
Went in the same place with me, Macintosh and Garcia came in there.

2357
01:52:47.76 --> 01:52:50.76
And then he said, all we need is teams more ends and right.

2358
01:52:50.76 --> 01:52:52.76
So I told you about that, right?

2359
01:52:52.76 --> 01:52:55.76
Yeah. So, so that was tobacco Lewis.

2360
01:52:55.76 --> 01:52:57.76
Yeah. Okay. We ratted him off.

2361
01:52:57.76 --> 01:52:59.76
That was that goddamn tobacco Lewis.

2362
01:52:59.76 --> 01:53:04.76
And so, so we come in and, and, and, and I could, and he's still sitting down there.

2363
01:53:04.76 --> 01:53:09.76
Right. So we walk in and he just kind of looks at us and hi, it says, uh, you want a beer?

2364
01:53:09.76 --> 01:53:13.76
I said, yeah. And there, and there was a Kagan in the trade.

2365
01:53:13.76 --> 01:53:17.76
And it's high at the name of the guy that you had not been able to communicate with.

2366
01:53:17.76 --> 01:53:18.76
Yeah. I love him.

2367
01:53:18.76 --> 01:53:20.76
And now he says, hey, you want a beer?

2368
01:53:20.76 --> 01:53:23.76
He's my best friend. Yeah. In the teams. Yeah.

2369
01:53:23.76 --> 01:53:26.76
I shouldn't have ratted him off, but he's, he's, he's okay.

2370
01:53:26.76 --> 01:53:30.76
So he says, you want a beer?

2371
01:53:30.76 --> 01:53:37.76
I said, yeah. So he pours a beer picture and guys would buy Kags a beer for getting divorced,

2372
01:53:37.76 --> 01:53:45.76
getting married, uh, getting promoted, getting demoted, getting killed in Vietnam,

2373
01:53:45.76 --> 01:53:51.76
coming back from anything. There's always, there was always a Kagan the afternoon. Monday, you know, Wednesday.

2374
01:53:51.76 --> 01:53:56.76
Yeah. So there was always one there. So there was always a Kags.

2375
01:53:56.76 --> 01:53:59.76
So like, but three o'clock to probably about five, I mean, guys,

2376
01:53:59.76 --> 01:54:02.76
they'd all get in and drink a bunch of beer and then it would go on.

2377
01:54:02.76 --> 01:54:07.76
So we drank that cake, that, that, that picture of beer.

2378
01:54:07.76 --> 01:54:10.76
And then he said, uh, then I said, Hey, you want another picture?

2379
01:54:10.76 --> 01:54:16.76
He goes, yeah, sure. So I poured him a beer. We sat there sitting at the corner.

2380
01:54:16.76 --> 01:54:19.76
I'm sitting right here. He's right here. The door is right there.

2381
01:54:19.76 --> 01:54:25.76
You always, I always sat there because you don't have, you know, you don't ever walk in that door either without kind of check.

2382
01:54:25.76 --> 01:54:28.76
Cause you could get hit pretty easy. I mean, there's some good fights in there.

2383
01:54:28.76 --> 01:54:34.76
It was wild place. And, um, she wouldn't hear about Anton.

2384
01:54:34.76 --> 01:54:41.76
I said, yeah. So he told me about the helicopters, about getting hit and getting out and saying, man, I don't know how we flew out of there.

2385
01:54:41.76 --> 01:54:46.76
You know, everybody was wounded. The helicopter was shot. Everything was, he said, and he didn't get hit.

2386
01:54:46.76 --> 01:54:48.76
He's never been hit. Right?

2387
01:54:48.76 --> 01:54:53.76
Uh, I was with him.

2388
01:54:53.76 --> 01:55:01.76
Uh, anyway, you're sharing that story with me, you know, and then he's crying and I'm crying.

2389
01:55:01.76 --> 01:55:08.76
And guys, it was so beautiful about the bar was man, the other guys would come in and they go, uh, they got a thing going on.

2390
01:55:08.76 --> 01:55:11.76
Not, not interrupt you and not look down on you.

2391
01:55:11.76 --> 01:55:18.76
Guys are having their own memorials times for themselves in your own space, in your own and respecting it.

2392
01:55:18.76 --> 01:55:25.76
You know, that was, it was kind of like the womb. I mean, that bar was kind of like where guys would come in with pain.

2393
01:55:25.76 --> 01:55:34.76
They would come in with anger. They would come in proud that they have kids, you know, that it was, it was a place that, that everybody felt safe, you know.

2394
01:55:34.76 --> 01:55:47.76
And, uh, so he, that's when he became my teammate, you know, of him sharing that with me, you know, and we did a talk one time for,

2395
01:55:47.76 --> 01:55:53.76
Seawolf gunships, you know, come to Texas and he says, Espy, you want to tell me that story about the Seawolf gunships?

2396
01:55:53.76 --> 01:55:59.76
And I go, what do you tell? He goes, Oh, no, you see, you like, you like talking. You see, you tell me.

2397
01:55:59.76 --> 01:56:05.76
So I said, all right, so we got shot at, you know, we were on a dyke and these guys shot at us.

2398
01:56:05.76 --> 01:56:10.76
And so we're, and Hyatt had his shit together. The officer we had was a young guy, right?

2399
01:56:10.76 --> 01:56:19.76
So he's like, do we engage him? You know, and I look out there and he goes, that's, see that's, you mean, engaged?

2400
01:56:19.76 --> 01:56:27.76
Me shooting. Engaged who? The guys that were shooting at us on this little kind of an up like a little dyke, you know, we were up on top of the dyke.

2401
01:56:27.76 --> 01:56:35.76
So they were shooting up at us. Well, the first thing is somebody shooting at you down from down below. They got something, you know, but, but he was a brand new officer.

2402
01:56:35.76 --> 01:56:42.76
Actually, he, he relieved Boston Campbell, who'd stepped on a booby trap. That was, that was another op that we were on.

2403
01:56:42.76 --> 01:56:49.76
Lit him up. Point man got some strap on his ass and Doc Maynard was with us and he had me walk the point out.

2404
01:56:49.76 --> 01:57:00.76
And, but I'm kind of getting a little cross ways here, but where was I at?

2405
01:57:00.76 --> 01:57:12.76
So I mean, just basically you were talking about the trade wins and how that's kind of when you guys got tight. And I mean, I suppose the next thing is so you're doing a work up and preparing to go back to Vietnam or

2406
01:57:12.76 --> 01:57:20.76
preparing to go your first deployment to Vietnam. Right. Right. And, and was that was that like a six month cycle? You go to Nile and there's a six month cycle.

2407
01:57:20.76 --> 01:57:27.76
You go to Nile and Nile and you go queer market, do the jump thing you do. You're just mostly, you know, patrolling.

2408
01:57:27.76 --> 01:57:36.76
How many guys you got in your platoon? 14? Yeah, 14 guys. And, and he told me, he says, yes, he says, you stay with me. You won't get hurt.

2409
01:57:36.76 --> 01:57:46.76
Sorry. This is my seed daddy, man. He my partner. Is it high? Yeah. And so matter of fact, I have this watch because of him. We come back from Vietnam.

2410
01:57:46.76 --> 01:57:55.76
We go under. He says, how much money you got? I said, I don't know. So catch the money out. So I got the 125 bucks. He grabs it and say, hey, man, give me money.

2411
01:57:55.76 --> 01:58:04.76
I said, we're going out and partying tonight. I said, nope. You're coming with me. So we go to the PX. I said, I ain't nothing in the PX.

2412
01:58:04.76 --> 01:58:13.76
I want. He says, yeah. So we go in there and he looks at the lady says I want that one and that one. Two Rolexes. She puts them up.

2413
01:58:13.76 --> 01:58:17.76
I said, lady says, I don't want to Rolex. So she puts it down.

2414
01:58:17.76 --> 01:58:31.76
So finally says lady, she puts it up. I said, lady and she goes, little fella, he's a lot bigger than you. And today you're buying yourself a Rolex watch, you know, it was that kind of a thing.

2415
01:58:31.76 --> 01:58:46.76
And we went, we took a break one time went to now Bay is where he had operated. He had this was his third trip to with SEAL team and one with UD.

2416
01:58:46.76 --> 01:59:01.76
T and they threw us out. They threw us out of the base for fighting. So we had nowhere to stay except for places that he knew, you know, back out in town.

2417
01:59:01.76 --> 01:59:11.76
Yeah, out in town. Yeah. Yeah. So we were out in town hiding. We were out there hiding, right? And so at night, during the day, we'd kind of hang out and then at night, the Vietcong would come in.

2418
01:59:11.76 --> 01:59:20.76
So we'd be sheltered in these places and the Vietcong would be in these places that we were at during the day partying and drinking and dating girls and or whatever.

2419
01:59:20.76 --> 01:59:30.76
And we were, we were hiding. And then in the morning, the Vietcong would leave and then we'd wake up, you know, for three days, we did that that close to the enemy is cool.

2420
01:59:30.76 --> 01:59:38.76
You know, they don't even know that you're there, you know. And so that was our, that was our relationship.

2421
01:59:38.76 --> 01:59:46.76
So when you're, you finish your work up and now it's time to, now it's time to fly to Vietcong. Now it's time to fly.

2422
01:59:46.76 --> 01:59:54.76
Did you leave from North Island? We left from North Island. Well, like a C-130? C-130. Yeah, the little one, little C-117. Oh, dang. Okay. Cargo plane, right?

2423
01:59:54.76 --> 02:00:01.76
So that's, that's where we went and we stage all our gear and everything. We get in there and the, boom, it's loud.

2424
02:00:01.76 --> 02:00:02.76
What year was this?

2425
02:00:02.76 --> 02:00:15.76
69. It was March, March, yeah, March of 69. March of 69. So we, we, we getting ready to roll, looking at the rivets and stuff, looking at the chief that comes in there to fly the airplanes.

2426
02:00:15.76 --> 02:00:26.76
Big old Billy and got his chief's hat and. And he's the pilot? He's the pilot. Oh, that's pretty cool. And you look out the window and like the airplane has all this grease and oil and stuff.

2427
02:00:26.76 --> 02:00:36.76
We go flying like this. Next thing is like, goes like, what the hell, you know, we turn off and, and so we get ourselves back together.

2428
02:00:36.76 --> 02:00:44.76
Goes, what's happening? He says, oh, I was looking at the lights. He says, look at the green light and the red light, the green light and the red light.

2429
02:00:44.76 --> 02:00:50.76
Pretty soon I was like, well, the green light and the red light, they're on the wrong sides. He wasn't following. It was coming right at him, right?

2430
02:00:50.76 --> 02:00:57.76
So he turns off. So I'm going, oh, man, I don't even get to Vietnam. That's happening. So then we get to Hawaii, right?

2431
02:00:57.76 --> 02:01:06.76
So we go in and hi, hi, it says, uh, hey, SP, I see this, uh, let's have a my type drink. He got this. Is it cool? All right.

2432
02:01:06.76 --> 02:01:15.76
We go in, man. Next thing you know, I'm waking up, I look down and there's a tomato stuck on Hyatt's face.

2433
02:01:15.76 --> 02:01:24.76
I was on the upper rack and I'd thrown up. He was on his face. Both in Campbell. We go, sounds the bitches. I told you, we're kind of looking around and

2434
02:01:24.76 --> 02:01:32.76
Hyatt gets up his hair sticking up in the air, you know, and I'm looking at him and I told you guys, we're leaving at zero, 600. You guys are late.

2435
02:01:32.76 --> 02:01:40.76
The chop, I mean, the hair planes rolling up and the number, and they says on the rest of God damn, but to never told you guys, God get your asses.

2436
02:01:40.76 --> 02:01:50.76
We're like grabbing stuff, you know, like grabbing my boots, putting stuff on. And I asked the boss, I said, hey, boss, who won the my type drink?

2437
02:01:50.76 --> 02:01:57.76
He got who won the my type drink cause his son of a bitch. As he says, you guys got drunk. Then you got in a fight in a bar.

2438
02:01:57.76 --> 02:02:06.76
They threw you out and then you guys stole a damn bus. The Navy bus, you know, they're driving around and we threw the sailors off the bus to

2439
02:02:06.76 --> 02:02:13.76
stole the bus and then they the short patrol tracked us down and we got in a fight with those guys on the bus. Then they arrested it.

2440
02:02:13.76 --> 02:02:19.76
One night in Hawaii right there was one night. One night in Hawaii. They need to get you guys to Vietnam stats.

2441
02:02:19.76 --> 02:02:27.76
Yeah, we were and there's another platoon that was before us. I think it's I can't remember who's between. I don't think it was crowd ads.

2442
02:02:27.76 --> 02:02:34.76
But anyway, their officer was in Vietnam waiting for them. Well, they got in the same fight, but it was the whole bar in that fight.

2443
02:02:34.76 --> 02:02:41.76
And I went to Barber's Point to see that bar. It's now a it's now a gym. But they got there and they got in a fight.

2444
02:02:41.76 --> 02:02:47.76
The officer sitting over there back in Vietnam waiting for his guys to show them where they all they had. And he gets this communique that comes

2445
02:02:47.76 --> 02:02:56.76
says, we don't know who they are. We don't know where they came from. But we know they're headed your way. And those guys have gotten a fight and

2446
02:02:56.76 --> 02:03:05.76
they started a fire in the bar. And the whole mean. And if you think about it, right, think about something is going to go to war.

2447
02:03:05.76 --> 02:03:18.76
You're internalizing that shit. And so you are loose. You know, it's like and so you want to try to take these people and tell them that no, you, you, it's, it's

2448
02:03:18.76 --> 02:03:20.76
follow the rules.

2449
02:03:20.76 --> 02:03:31.76
You can try. Yeah, that that is something that in in the military, certainly in SEAL teams, you know, you're like you're parachuting, you're

2450
02:03:31.76 --> 02:03:36.76
diving, they're doing a bunch of dangerous stuff. And when you're young, you're like, well, you know, I could die tomorrow. So I'm going to have a good time tonight.

2451
02:03:36.76 --> 02:03:44.76
That's what that's what we're doing. And the consequences, right? The consequences of mistake are brutal. They're not you can if you're working on

2452
02:03:44.76 --> 02:03:54.76
an officer, cut your finger, whatever. But we we fuck up out there. We mess up out there. And the same thing when it came on the fire department, you know, two guys got killed in my fire

2453
02:03:54.76 --> 02:04:05.76
training. And I thought, okay, Vietnam, probably going to get killed. Got on fire department, maybe. But this is really kind of a lame kind of job. I mean, you fight some fire, you do.

2454
02:04:05.76 --> 02:04:18.76
I saw it totally different when I got there, right? It transitioned. It changed for me about especially when I went up in rank, it's like being a platoon leader. You know, the other guys do whatever they want to do in the

2455
02:04:18.76 --> 02:04:41.76
platoon. But as a platoon officer and the platoon leader, then as a battalion chief and as in the fire department, I'm responsible for them to keep them alive. I become Chief Gustafels wife. You know, and so yeah, it was you really

2456
02:04:41.76 --> 02:04:56.76
know, I've been talking a lot about what that quit that means and those consequences and what's and what's real and what is it to be a real frogman. Right. They're the machismo crazy cats out there. But they are they good

2457
02:04:56.76 --> 02:05:09.76
operators? Are they running on on their ego? Or are they running on the teams? You know, do you love the teams? Or do you love yourself? Right. And a lot of the cats love themselves.

2458
02:05:09.76 --> 02:05:23.76
They're willing to make that or create that for for some reason. I look at some of the events, you know, of how guys are getting killed now and I'm thinking it's like when I when we got when we got shot at and then the

2459
02:05:23.76 --> 02:05:36.76
officer says, we take him under fire. We look at him and go, you fucking crazy. If we take him under fire, they're going to know how many of us there are. Right. So then we start receiving fire. So we cause an

2460
02:05:36.76 --> 02:05:51.76
extraction. There was nobody coming to get us the armies. Sometimes the army slick guys would not come in, but a seawolf. They're coming. Well, they're coming. You know, I've had quite a few seawolf pilots on here. Yeah, it's

2461
02:05:51.76 --> 02:06:04.76
awesome. And so when they lock and load and they're done, they're dumping their ammunition just to get four cats up. I mean that that whole that whole thing is on fire, right? So we're running. So we had no air support until those seawolves guys who were

2462
02:06:04.76 --> 02:06:17.76
coming. And a couple Air Force guys. Yeah, we're in our little phantoms. And if you need some help, we can we can help you. And so I'm at the back end, right? Everybody's running. Blow everything up on the backside of the blue blue

2463
02:06:17.76 --> 02:06:29.76
blue strobe, right? So I got a blue strobe lit up and I'm running got I got m 60. I'm running heavy running m 60 and I hide something headed me and Richard's he married his sister, his Richard's sister, height, Richard's

2464
02:06:29.76 --> 02:06:46.76
sister. And we're all we're all we're good mates, man. I mean, there's some bars in San Diego that remember us. Just you're still still not allowed in. Oh, just by being crazy. Yeah. So I'm running and I fall in a hall. I mean, and these guys Air Force

2465
02:06:46.76 --> 02:06:59.76
guys are coming flying like this, right? And when they're lighting their stuff up, it looks like it looks like it's certainly about 1015 feet up of the air because you're running. But they don't tell you like you see the movies, they don't

2466
02:06:59.76 --> 02:07:17.76
mean they don't mean you're getting support. They don't talk about the in those days, the links are rolling out. So you're running along and all the case is this stuff is beaten the hell out of you, you're running like this, you know, try not to get them down your shirt, you're running and they're flying is like two of them.

2467
02:07:17.76 --> 02:07:31.76
And in the water and in mean the casings and I fell in this hole and it wasn't even if they could hear me because the whole world behind me, I feel the heat and everything behind me blowing up. They just stopped.

2468
02:07:31.76 --> 02:07:41.76
They ran back. One grabbed the barrel, the other grab the butt, lift me out of the hole. They took off running. And I'm like, your feet on the ground.

2469
02:07:41.76 --> 02:07:54.76
Every once in a while, one would hear them finally I got my feet, you know, and then we got over to the on the seawall was locked loading dumping all the ammunition on the other side the side that we were coming on they weren't right.

2470
02:07:54.76 --> 02:08:09.76
And so we jumped in and then they started dumping it all and then that how I was trying to and everything everything's going well I told that story and then when and I told me to tell it with the seawolf guys right is in Texas.

2471
02:08:09.76 --> 02:08:18.76
And so then he says you tell the story is alright so then I feel okay with tell the story as close as I could get it because everybody has their own story.

2472
02:08:18.76 --> 02:08:38.76
And then I saw how I get up and he walked over up to the podium, you know, when I was there and he comes up beside me, he says, well that opted as we just told you about he says I didn't realize how much that helicopter meant to me.

2473
02:08:38.76 --> 02:08:46.76
And how safe I felt once my hand touched that helicopter. Then I knew I was okay.

2474
02:08:46.76 --> 02:08:50.76
And I never, I never ever thought that because he's always so calm.

2475
02:08:50.76 --> 02:09:07.76
He's running, we all are put to wear a bunch of calm people, you know, and that and when you have that in your platoon, except when you're yelling and they're running away from you know I'm going to God dang whole you know like, you know, everybody is like that it's that calmness.

2476
02:09:07.76 --> 02:09:18.76
That keeps you right. And if your officers calm, even pose a camera when he got lit up, you know, he really did a real easy transfer to doc Maynard.

2477
02:09:18.76 --> 02:09:24.76
And they they an Air Force helicopter with doctors happen to be coming in. We were in a booby trapped area.

2478
02:09:24.76 --> 02:09:29.76
So we're trying to secure the area. We're receiving fire from a little hooch down there.

2479
02:09:29.76 --> 02:09:43.76
And me and hi at lit that up. That up was that whole thing. The whole dynamics of like when I wrote that piece about the flash right, the flash of war, you know that whether you're creating it or whether it's being created for you.

2480
02:09:43.76 --> 02:09:55.76
The the inside warriors working and figuring it out. The outside warrior is non forgiving and violent.

2481
02:09:55.76 --> 02:10:05.76
Right. And they're both standing out. And I think, you know, the in the little boy in there is is is watching that happen.

2482
02:10:05.76 --> 02:10:20.76
And and I think the whole war piece is totally alien, because that's not where we really want to go. So those of us that pay that price, you know, it's going to cost you something, even in the training because pain is going to cost you something.

2483
02:10:20.76 --> 02:10:33.76
When I got back from Vietnam doing my out in the world. I thought that was me. That's just the way that I am, you know, I'm five and all that kind of stuff. That's who Espanol is.

2484
02:10:33.76 --> 02:10:43.76
It was all my behaviors. I I confused my behaviors for who I who I am. And I let loose of it because then I was alone again. I lost all my teammates.

2485
02:10:43.76 --> 02:10:59.76
I wasn't like between when I lost them that time when I came from Vietnam and I left, right? I'm alone again. Right. And it's taking me now to come back to that space of understanding my life.

2486
02:10:59.76 --> 02:11:12.76
Right. That's crazy. I'm 75 years old trying to figure this stuff out. And then I look at guys like you you got your podcast you got your thing going to do to if they had a MMA when I was coming back from the mod have been

2487
02:11:12.76 --> 02:11:25.76
to I was going to five points endeavor to fight mostly black guys because that's where the danger was. They had guns and knives. And that was you're going to fight in Boulder right with the hippies. I mean there's

2488
02:11:25.76 --> 02:11:40.76
maybe there wasn't much. So you might go to might go to might go to this place called Peggy's High Low and you get a hookup with a cowboy. You know, at least when you're fighting those guys is in the dirt.

2489
02:11:40.76 --> 02:11:51.76
You know, but and I remember going in there and this one big brothers in there because I'm looking because I'm checking security right. The other thing is looking at the environment.

2490
02:11:51.76 --> 02:12:04.76
Those challenges are looking at the bar and where's the security at where's these guys whom I'm watching out for. It was like being working with the pro program and knowing that you had the 50 guys you got probably eight or nine of them that are

2491
02:12:04.76 --> 02:12:18.76
working with the con that are that are two hoys or they're they're they're working both sides. That was exciting. That was the cool thing about when I was with my partner and I work in that program versus working the

2492
02:12:18.76 --> 02:12:34.76
Vietnamese seals we knew and I did that with two East Coast guys first. So I worked with them and then they took another West Coast guy in my platoon that worked with those guys with the Vietnamese seals. And then they said oh by the way you guys have that expertise. Why don't you and me and me and

2493
02:12:34.76 --> 02:12:50.76
Bill we went work for the Pruse. We did that. That's where I leave my cousin right. That whole thing that whole challenging thing about depending upon the spirit and understanding the awareness about who you are is exciting.

2494
02:12:50.76 --> 02:13:03.76
You know and I wasn't getting that you know. So I was creating the tension outside warrior creates the tension so that and that's who you think you are and it's and so then you live your life out like that.

2495
02:13:03.76 --> 02:13:20.76
You know you're a frog man. You know I'm a I'm a genuine. We say genuine barrel chested anti magnetic chrome plated Rolex wearing K bar carrying root and two and parachute and ever from frog man who can take 40 men 40 days to track me down. I can see in the dark

2496
02:13:20.76 --> 02:13:35.76
breathing the water and I can fly you know that whole that whole thing you know. And so it's so that's who that's what I thought I was when I got on the fire department. I'm going to look at all these.

2497
02:13:35.76 --> 02:13:44.76
These guys don't even train you know and then two guys get killed in training then they're blaming everybody. Oh you know you're just this and that and then none of you guys wanted to train.

2498
02:13:44.76 --> 02:13:55.76
This is our fault. So then when my buddy got killed is kind of like what do I do here. The word sacrificial responsibility comes up.

2499
02:13:55.76 --> 02:14:08.76
Sacrificial responsibility. Right. Christ. Jesus man. He didn't have to die. He's God and everything else when he's going to go. Should I got to die for these morons because they ain't going to figure it out.

2500
02:14:08.76 --> 02:14:19.76
Right. So here you are. I'm going to Vietnam. I'm going with these guys. Why. That's not what your country could do for you but what you can do for your country.

2501
02:14:19.76 --> 02:14:34.76
So you go OK. I'm here. Where can I go. My coach told me about being a frog man. Right. Then you get there and you see these guys and you see these instructors bigger than life and nobody knew who the seal was.

2502
02:14:34.76 --> 02:14:46.76
I knew what a frog man was. I wanted to put him where my swim jokes and get a suntan and all that stuff. Then there's the choice. You choose to do that or not. Are you going to choose to be part of this family or not.

2503
02:14:46.76 --> 02:14:55.76
And there are kids in their own families right now that are choosing. They don't want to contribute to that. About the reputation of your family.

2504
02:14:55.76 --> 02:15:08.76
My dad told me one time and said Gibi said the only thing that ever gave you was my last name. Don't be dishonor on it. Right. And this is the same guy in fourth grade education. Right.

2505
02:15:08.76 --> 02:15:20.76
The biggest thing that I learned from him was part of preparing me for the teams. We were hunting. My dad said Gibi we shot a no we tracked him down. It's getting cold. It's night.

2506
02:15:20.76 --> 02:15:32.76
I'm freezing. We're poor. We may have cotton gloves. There's none of this cabela shit all that. Right. And we're two pair of two pair of Levi's. It's cold. I'm 10 years old.

2507
02:15:32.76 --> 02:15:40.76
With my dad. We shot him. We got to find him. We're Indians. We don't leave. We don't leave stuff out here. We'll track him. We'll find him.

2508
02:15:40.76 --> 02:15:52.76
I didn't realize because of our subsistence we we killed an elk hunting in the winter time and we fished all summer long. That's how we ate and we would plant stuff in the garden and we'd raise chickens and rabbits.

2509
02:15:52.76 --> 02:16:02.76
That's how we ate. That's not a bad diet but hell man you get tired of getting eggs you get plucking chickens and skin and rabbits and he has me up there hunting right.

2510
02:16:02.76 --> 02:16:15.76
I got dad come on you know it's just no to weak track him down there he is there is the elk so we're tracking you can see a little bit of the blood the winds blowing is getting cold and everything else.

2511
02:16:15.76 --> 02:16:27.76
Sometimes I was fishing with him at night I didn't want to be out there freezing my butt off man and it's when I would get cold out in the Coronado man I remember being a barker down freezing my ass off with my dad.

2512
02:16:27.76 --> 02:16:34.76
I never thought about what the temperature of the water was but I knew it was cold so so I'm.

2513
02:16:34.76 --> 02:16:38.76
We find the elk and he says okay give me says.

2514
02:16:38.76 --> 02:16:47.76
Now you got to go back and get the hunters get the rest of the guys Mr. Mr. Chavez my brother and Mr. Gomez you know I was going.

2515
02:16:47.76 --> 02:16:57.76
Dad yeah dad I said I don't know you know he says look grabs me look at me right in the eyes he says listen.

2516
02:16:57.76 --> 02:17:04.76
What you're feeling is fear I understand it.

2517
02:17:04.76 --> 02:17:12.76
Don't be afraid.

2518
02:17:12.76 --> 02:17:25.76
Okay so I take off you know and I went and it isn't like left and right so then when you're talking about the spirit of God right this whatever is the guide you and when you're in combat whenever you're doing stuff a lot of guys.

2519
02:17:25.76 --> 02:17:33.76
A lot of guys have this a lot of times they think it's them but then there's other things that put you in a different place and the only thing that.

2520
02:17:33.76 --> 02:17:48.76
That you survived another guys didn't is time and chance right and making a decision when we're the other thing however it gets you there whatever it is and you can't feel sorry that you survived and they didn't that's life right.

2521
02:17:48.76 --> 02:17:57.76
So my dad sends me to go find these guys I'm going I'm looking at the track and there was like I don't know where to go.

2522
02:17:57.76 --> 02:18:09.76
And then in here is like when I go and I find it I find my dad shot an elk and I grab them and they come on yeah okay they follow me out they grabbed her guns they grab poles they.

2523
02:18:09.76 --> 02:18:17.76
We go out there and we find my dad and he's out there smoking cigarette looking at him.

2524
02:18:17.76 --> 02:18:31.76
It's a you know now that's a big elk you know and my dad had had me we always carried a little bag that had a hatchet bone saw and his knives in there right that's what he gave me before I told me go get a hundred right.

2525
02:18:31.76 --> 02:18:39.76
So I went up to where my dad was and he grabbed my face like this you know looking down at me.

2526
02:18:39.76 --> 02:18:53.76
I said I knew you could do that you know and when I when I read like in the in the that we're God when when Christ got baptized right that the word says that.

2527
02:18:53.76 --> 02:18:55.76
So this is my son.

2528
02:18:55.76 --> 02:18:58.76
Who I'm well pleased.

2529
02:18:58.76 --> 02:19:09.76
I thought I thought when my dad grabbed my face and told me that I thought wow man it was my responsibility.

2530
02:19:09.76 --> 02:19:15.76
But my dad just surprised sacrificing my life for a year to go get those guys you know.

2531
02:19:15.76 --> 02:19:22.76
But but but you know what I'm saying it's like.

2532
02:19:22.76 --> 02:19:29.76
Yeah and people say well it's a calling to be a frog man well it's a there's a thing I think our egos.

2533
02:19:29.76 --> 02:19:37.76
Well can I make it can I not some guys can say I never had any doubt right that they've been supported with their families all the time right.

2534
02:19:37.76 --> 02:19:48.76
My family supported when we were writing the letter when I was going back into forty two about mom I really want I want this more than anything in the world right.

2535
02:19:48.76 --> 02:19:55.76
And my mom knew now fifty years later right they did that class on two thirty.

2536
02:19:55.76 --> 02:20:01.76
My mom says I knew you were in Seelting but I didn't know that's I didn't know that's what you were doing right.

2537
02:20:01.76 --> 02:20:03.76
That's even after Vietnam right.

2538
02:20:03.76 --> 02:20:05.76
I didn't know that that's what you were doing.

2539
02:20:05.76 --> 02:20:13.76
But I do remember my mom actually my sister said oh give me a yes mom almost got in a fight with Miss Martinez.

2540
02:20:13.76 --> 02:20:21.76
Really she said yes she said she told me you're going to Vietnam and she said well all he is is going to do is be fodder.

2541
02:20:21.76 --> 02:20:33.76
You told me my son's father I'll kick the hell out of you know that not always supported my mom was kind of domineering and kind of mean really.

2542
02:20:33.76 --> 02:20:42.76
But but but I knew they were always there for me you know and even when I came back in Vietnam my dad.

2543
02:20:42.76 --> 02:20:47.76
You know after my work up after I did all my stuff.

2544
02:20:47.76 --> 02:20:57.76
Vietnam veterans against war the young Socialist Republic I'm going to school at CU I got a letter when I was getting back from Vietnam to wrestle at the University of Colorado.

2545
02:20:57.76 --> 02:21:07.76
A dream I thought was already gone I was a hundred eighteen pounds right so I'm barely making hundred twenty nine didn't really have to cut I must still just a little guy.

2546
02:21:07.76 --> 02:21:15.76
These guys my kids we go to reunions they sit there looking and they finally got to the age where they went dad yes just.

2547
02:21:15.76 --> 02:21:17.76
You're the littlest guy here.

2548
02:21:17.76 --> 02:21:26.76
I'm the little guy of my life but you know when I when I got that letter it's like a whole new thing.

2549
02:21:26.76 --> 02:21:32.76
I didn't fit I wasn't brown enough to be brown I wasn't white enough to be fight I was a Vietnam vet.

2550
02:21:32.76 --> 02:21:42.76
I just got done killing a commie for mommy with my teammates and stuff like that and they're telling me Viva La Raza that's Lon and all that is like I'm an American.

2551
02:21:42.76 --> 02:21:55.76
You know my people have always been from here and it doesn't even have to be that they're from here but this is what I feel in here it's from my heart from my soul it didn't come but it did the ego is yeah I.

2552
02:21:55.76 --> 02:22:03.76
Be one of those frog man to start getting shot at and then you're asking yourself what.

2553
02:22:03.76 --> 02:22:11.76
What am I doing here and then you come out with all your teammates everybody you know like after the operate you also they're looking to kill their and go.

2554
02:22:11.76 --> 02:22:17.76
Wow that was pretty intense you know.

2555
02:22:17.76 --> 02:22:28.76
And the guy that was always pretty cool was Lou you know when I got when I got hit you know he was pissed at me.

2556
02:22:28.76 --> 02:22:38.76
What'd you get when you get hit I picked up some shrapnel by Cambodia you know we would we'd be on these barges and they'd float down river and we'd operate off him.

2557
02:22:38.76 --> 02:22:50.76
And this one you got there that was the first thing you got tasked with was the first thing you got tasked with when you got on the ground was your job would you put to know operate as a platoon or do you immediately get shaved off and.

2558
02:22:50.76 --> 02:22:57.76
No first of all like for the first three months you know we were all operate as all platoon operations down in Sadek off of PBRs right.

2559
02:22:57.76 --> 02:23:09.76
And then what were you doing we guys doing ambushes raids ambushes prisoner snatch we like find out with the tax collectors that we'd use the intel and capture them.

2560
02:23:09.76 --> 02:23:12.76
Who's getting the intel the were you guys getting it yourselves.

2561
02:23:12.76 --> 02:23:22.76
It's mostly yeah well we had like the Nilo out of Saigon some of our officers Captain Shiball was Mirra Anderson was there some other team guys they were getting the information.

2562
02:23:22.76 --> 02:23:38.76
So you'd get a target package like oh here's here's a grid location for a little village somewhere yeah and they'd be like that's it's this hooch over here is where this tax collector is this via con tax collector the VCI yeah this is where he's supposed to be right.

2563
02:23:38.76 --> 02:23:47.76
So we go down and get him or we would just go sit and watch and sit there for two days and see what boats come where they come just hidden.

2564
02:23:47.76 --> 02:23:56.76
So you do you do just like a reconnaissance doing this wait and watch do an assessment wait and watch how many weapons how are you mostly going in by the water.

2565
02:23:56.76 --> 02:24:08.76
In this first three months yeah like just waterborne operations yeah on PBRs and our own LSS C's and LCPL it's a big boat with a minigun on the back couple 60s and.

2566
02:24:08.76 --> 02:24:12.76
And so would you insert at night they just kind of drop you off most of them at night.

2567
02:24:12.76 --> 02:24:20.76
We liked operating at night more than during the day and then we sit during the day and watch it all we even know we even know we were there.

2568
02:24:20.76 --> 02:24:28.76
How many guys would you have out most recon well would you take the whole squad yeah we take a platoon depending upon.

2569
02:24:28.76 --> 02:24:39.76
Like if we were expecting something big or we just do seven man teams and were you usually a point man as point and rear can like go back and forth you know.

2570
02:24:39.76 --> 02:24:48.76
So when I put it but when our point man went on our he went to Australia and then I ran point for a while would you carry for a weapon you carry a stoner.

2571
02:24:48.76 --> 02:24:56.76
Yeah a stoner except when I was with the Vietnamese and I carried in 60 you know how can you how can we carry an M60 when you're with the Vietnamese.

2572
02:24:56.76 --> 02:25:04.76
How can we switch from a stoner to a 60 because I just wanted something bigger something bigger like this like the son like they had their M16s right.

2573
02:25:04.76 --> 02:25:12.76
They didn't they didn't have stoners when we were Vietnamese they didn't have stoners there was only 16s but I just felt.

2574
02:25:12.76 --> 02:25:20.76
I thought it's something big yeah you know and you want to pig yeah and with the two Vietnamese there was another Vietnamese guy there was only one.

2575
02:25:20.76 --> 02:25:37.76
I'm 60 so I made two 60s right and that's just I don't know if it's a rule I don't know if it's a logical thinking but that's and then my buddy Bill he was a radio man.

2576
02:25:37.76 --> 02:25:41.76
So working with the Vietnamese is an advisor I dug you know.

2577
02:25:41.76 --> 02:25:46.76
Yeah when you were doing the first three months so you're doing ops.

2578
02:25:46.76 --> 02:25:57.76
You guys are carrying compared to what we have to carry now the modern guys with body armor and ready everybody's carrying the radio everyone's carrying body armor everyone's wearing a helmet everyone has night vision.

2579
02:25:57.76 --> 02:26:11.76
It's like even the weapons because you get your weapon but then on your weapon you put a laser and you put a scope and it is if you put a light like everything's just you guys look like super slick compared to us we were we were quiet.

2580
02:26:11.76 --> 02:26:23.76
We're a pair of Levi's couple you know our stuff where some guys were the stuff on the outside but if you went around the wrong side you'd want to put your stuff on inside to keep from getting muddy put your bandoliers on the inside.

2581
02:26:23.76 --> 02:26:27.76
Yeah you were your your oh your web gear.

2582
02:26:27.76 --> 02:26:36.76
Well we did what if you carried if you if you if you did it like this right if you strapped them on there you didn't really wear web gear right.

2583
02:26:36.76 --> 02:26:48.76
You could wear the harness right just the harness and then other guys had their vests made up like what you wear now the best guys would go to the parachute loft and have them created right for their.

2584
02:26:48.76 --> 02:26:52.76
M16 magazines and things like that.

2585
02:26:52.76 --> 02:26:54.76
So you were wearing jeans though.

2586
02:26:54.76 --> 02:27:02.76
This is the one this is the one bullshit thing about all these guys and these frog men seal team guys right.

2587
02:27:02.76 --> 02:27:06.76
Oh yeah because it was better than the BDU's and all that bullshit.

2588
02:27:06.76 --> 02:27:16.76
You were you were Levi's and they're wet and they're muddy and they're heavy and you get chafed and all that and try to take a shit with a pair of Levi's.

2589
02:27:16.76 --> 02:27:25.76
You know so why'd you wear them because it looked cool combat qualified man you want to combat qualified pair of Levi's.

2590
02:27:25.76 --> 02:27:30.76
So when you got home right it makes more sense right when you got home.

2591
02:27:30.76 --> 02:27:38.76
You walk along with Levi's man you know that that was the main reason the delta these are from the delta man.

2592
02:27:38.76 --> 02:27:43.76
These are whatever there's on five combat ops you know what I mean that's what it was about.

2593
02:27:43.76 --> 02:27:47.76
I make a pair of jeans right now and we call them Delta 68's.

2594
02:27:47.76 --> 02:27:54.76
Oh yeah we make a pair of jeans and we call them Delta 68's in honor of you guys wearing them back in the day.

2595
02:27:54.76 --> 02:28:06.76
Yeah so yeah that's that was why you know because there's nothing nothing cooler than walking downtown San Diego or downtown Coronado with four guys that have combat qualified Levi's on.

2596
02:28:06.76 --> 02:28:16.76
And you're going to run into some Marines are going to sit there and look at you like it's just you know even these watches would get you in a fight with them.

2597
02:28:16.76 --> 02:28:21.76
I was sitting at the daylight cafe down in Coronado.

2598
02:28:21.76 --> 02:28:24.76
No oh the day and night cafe day and night cafe a little long booth.

2599
02:28:24.76 --> 02:28:25.76
Yeah I've been there.

2600
02:28:25.76 --> 02:28:33.76
I'm sitting there with me and me and Hyatt right so we're eating and this guy comes up behind says oh so you look like you're one of those little wet back frog man.

2601
02:28:33.76 --> 02:28:36.76
So I'm like oh shit.

2602
02:28:36.76 --> 02:28:38.76
It's going to be one of those nights.

2603
02:28:38.76 --> 02:28:47.76
It's going to be one of those nights and Hyatt looks like a mother fuckers you're going to call him with wet back and be me's is not you and I don't call him that.

2604
02:28:47.76 --> 02:28:51.76
I told him I said Lou I said be cool man it's alright.

2605
02:28:51.76 --> 02:28:54.76
So I get done here and says I'm gonna kick the shit out of him.

2606
02:28:54.76 --> 02:28:56.76
Okay.

2607
02:28:56.76 --> 02:28:59.76
So I just almost finished.

2608
02:28:59.76 --> 02:29:05.76
So I finished up and I turned around.

2609
02:29:05.76 --> 02:29:07.76
Big boy.

2610
02:29:07.76 --> 02:29:08.76
Oh it's a big guy.

2611
02:29:08.76 --> 02:29:10.76
I went hey man I'm going to tell you something.

2612
02:29:10.76 --> 02:29:17.76
And so when I did that I just went him behind his neck and the other one underneath his throat and I hung on.

2613
02:29:17.76 --> 02:29:27.76
He moved and my heels were still arched on the wall and I hung on and then Hyatt jumps on top of the bar karate right.

2614
02:29:27.76 --> 02:29:30.76
So yeah stay away from the mother fuckers.

2615
02:29:30.76 --> 02:29:36.76
You know I'm just hanging on you know all this kind of stuff you know and those guys are looking at Lou you know and he's like no.

2616
02:29:36.76 --> 02:29:38.76
Like Bruce Lee what everything and they all like.

2617
02:29:38.76 --> 02:29:45.76
Like that you know so finally the guy they choked him out right to hung on and came around and choked him out.

2618
02:29:45.76 --> 02:29:51.76
Now I got Matt back hands him my watch pops off into the street right.

2619
02:29:51.76 --> 02:29:55.76
So I kick him in my shoe goes off into the street.

2620
02:29:55.76 --> 02:29:59.76
You just secure your gear better.

2621
02:29:59.76 --> 02:30:07.76
Hyatt just looks at me like that you know come on ask me let's leave this joint so we go out and I pick up my shoe and I put it on.

2622
02:30:07.76 --> 02:30:11.76
I put it on this way so we always thinking right.

2623
02:30:11.76 --> 02:30:16.76
So we walked to the corner and we get out there and he says let's look so we pick up the Christ.

2624
02:30:16.76 --> 02:30:18.76
So they come in so not yet.

2625
02:30:18.76 --> 02:30:21.76
He said well let's get out of here before that big somewhat bitch wakes up.

2626
02:30:21.76 --> 02:30:29.76
Because I got him by surprise you know but but but that's when you grab hold is like grab and hold of the tiger right.

2627
02:30:29.76 --> 02:30:34.76
You know that if you let loose he's going to jack you up you know.

2628
02:30:34.76 --> 02:30:42.76
So you know so you guys would run recon look at a target and then when you were going to go hit the target.

2629
02:30:42.76 --> 02:30:43.76
What was that.

2630
02:30:43.76 --> 02:30:45.76
What was the normal profile of a mission like that.

2631
02:30:45.76 --> 02:30:49.76
You take Sam pans in did you go in the night to your cool off.

2632
02:30:49.76 --> 02:30:52.76
We did we did work with the program.

2633
02:30:52.76 --> 02:30:53.76
This is a tip.

2634
02:30:53.76 --> 02:30:56.76
This is a an operation right.

2635
02:30:56.76 --> 02:30:58.76
Explain what the proof is.

2636
02:30:58.76 --> 02:31:00.76
It's province reconnaissance units right.

2637
02:31:00.76 --> 02:31:02.76
So these are Vietnamese.

2638
02:31:02.76 --> 02:31:04.76
They were Vietnamese.

2639
02:31:04.76 --> 02:31:05.76
They were not seals.

2640
02:31:05.76 --> 02:31:07.76
The seal program had its own stuff.

2641
02:31:07.76 --> 02:31:14.76
Vietnamese so they had Vietnamese seals and then they also had the PRU province reconnaissance units and they work for the company.

2642
02:31:14.76 --> 02:31:15.76
Right.

2643
02:31:15.76 --> 02:31:22.76
They had a case worker that usually in charge of them and senior officer American officer or an enlisted right.

2644
02:31:22.76 --> 02:31:28.76
My buddy and I relieved those guys and he was E4 and I think I was E4 right.

2645
02:31:28.76 --> 02:31:30.76
But we were operators right.

2646
02:31:30.76 --> 02:31:35.76
So how many people are in a PRU how many Vietnamese did you have in one of those groups.

2647
02:31:35.76 --> 02:31:36.76
40 in the group.

2648
02:31:36.76 --> 02:31:38.76
So there's 40 Vietnamese.

2649
02:31:38.76 --> 02:31:40.76
There's and there's two of you.

2650
02:31:40.76 --> 02:31:50.76
Two of us American advisors right and then the case worker and then an interpreter maybe two interpreters and out of that 40 probably about five or six of them you can count on being in Vietnam.

2651
02:31:50.76 --> 02:31:52.76
Did you live with them.

2652
02:31:52.76 --> 02:31:53.76
Yeah.

2653
02:31:53.76 --> 02:32:00.76
You lived with them on a bay like a like a villa type thing and yeah you just stayed with them.

2654
02:32:00.76 --> 02:32:02.76
And then what was the op tempo like.

2655
02:32:02.76 --> 02:32:07.76
Well probably you know we'd go out.

2656
02:32:07.76 --> 02:32:13.76
It depended on the that was what was spooky about it because a lot of their intel came from them.

2657
02:32:13.76 --> 02:32:14.76
Right.

2658
02:32:14.76 --> 02:32:16.76
So they could set you up.

2659
02:32:16.76 --> 02:32:24.76
They could set you the the guys in the company could set you up to be hit so you had to kind of figure things out and that happened to us a couple times.

2660
02:32:24.76 --> 02:32:26.76
That was and we got hit.

2661
02:32:26.76 --> 02:32:38.76
We figured out that was two guys that were kind of the when they were around things happened when they weren't around.

2662
02:32:38.76 --> 02:32:40.76
So what did you do about that.

2663
02:32:40.76 --> 02:32:52.76
Well I told the one guy I went my interpreter says to be a thing on like saw what you know they come to know they come to you know I don't like him.

2664
02:32:52.76 --> 02:32:54.76
I think he's a very bad man.

2665
02:32:54.76 --> 02:33:01.76
And says if you see you know and then did you see what's happening with this guy goes come go.

2666
02:33:01.76 --> 02:33:03.76
He says I take care of it.

2667
02:33:03.76 --> 02:33:05.76
So we have another op.

2668
02:33:05.76 --> 02:33:07.76
The guy didn't come back.

2669
02:33:07.76 --> 02:33:15.76
So because he my interpreter that guy was and he works with my cousin right was good and trustworthy.

2670
02:33:15.76 --> 02:33:16.76
And that's it.

2671
02:33:16.76 --> 02:33:25.76
See some were good and trusty somehow they're there the sacrificial responsibility the thing that they feel from the heart was right on and others and others were victims.

2672
02:33:25.76 --> 02:33:30.76
They're in the military by being a victim in the war is going where they're going to go.

2673
02:33:30.76 --> 02:33:32.76
Where they're going to go.

2674
02:33:32.76 --> 02:33:37.76
So you were about to you were about to tell about an op like a standard op that you did with the PRU.

2675
02:33:37.76 --> 02:33:45.76
Okay yeah one of our guys seal team one guy comes up to us and says hey we need some gunners right.

2676
02:33:45.76 --> 02:33:53.76
I have like I have two boats probably about six guys in each boat we're going to do a pro op we're going to go get these tax collectors right.

2677
02:33:53.76 --> 02:33:56.76
All I need you guys to do be shooters.

2678
02:33:56.76 --> 02:34:04.76
All right so my officer well like LCPO black mac was with me me hi at black mac.

2679
02:34:04.76 --> 02:34:07.76
I don't know if Macintosh was on it or not.

2680
02:34:07.76 --> 02:34:23.76
But so here we are in the sandpans for sandpans right there to black mac another guy and me and hi and we're going to we're going to take the bodies we're going to we're going to tie what we're going to take the bodies.

2681
02:34:23.76 --> 02:34:29.76
Launch off of a set off of a PBR in sandpans cruise up this little river.

2682
02:34:29.76 --> 02:34:34.76
It's nighttime it's nighttime you guys are you guys dressed like Vietnamese are you guys in black.

2683
02:34:34.76 --> 02:34:43.76
No you guys just well see that was our platoons to those some guys were black sometimes we're black pajamas were Levi's other guys be wearing green tops.

2684
02:34:43.76 --> 02:34:52.76
You're just you kind of mix and match always we did a blocking force one time and the army guys is who the fuck you guys you know hi says.

2685
02:34:52.76 --> 02:34:56.76
Well we said we're we're frogmen.

2686
02:34:56.76 --> 02:35:06.76
But there's a whole we're going to we're going to we're going to kill a colonel in his helicopter you know but we didn't but so the the I'm glad you didn't.

2687
02:35:06.76 --> 02:35:11.76
So was I high it was a gun up like that I'm going to shoot we're all going to shoot this guy.

2688
02:35:11.76 --> 02:35:13.76
Why was the colonel doing.

2689
02:35:13.76 --> 02:35:21.76
We were we got ambushed the army we were we're doing a blocking force behind an army that's the other thing too we'd work with some army so we're doing a blocking force an army unit.

2690
02:35:21.76 --> 02:35:23.76
They got sniped on.

2691
02:35:23.76 --> 02:35:38.76
So this guy in the colonel goes flying over and he throws a CS grenade out so the CS grenade goes out and pins his guys down they're getting sniped at the rest of us and we're in our different shit Levi some of us were laying up along bank and the

2692
02:35:38.76 --> 02:35:57.76
helicopter lands right outside of us right lands right outside of us so he comes walking along as we're laying up the bank and and he walks by had he's sitting there looking at us and hi says I guess you're the dumb motherfucker they do that CS grenade out.

2693
02:35:57.76 --> 02:36:09.76
So he goes yes who in the who in the fucking you guys.

2694
02:36:09.76 --> 02:36:27.76
They didn't they didn't matter back they got these guys out never wounded come on one guy got killed.

2695
02:36:27.76 --> 02:36:43.76
He just looks at him goes back to a helicopter and he gets in he sticks CS grenade out the blue sense of got his stoner and goes like this and I go shit so I grab mine and the other five guys they grab theirs were up there and I'm thinking.

2696
02:36:43.76 --> 02:36:52.76
He pulls the trigger that guy's going down he pulls it back in and leaves those are the guys as with and we all.

2697
02:36:52.76 --> 02:36:58.76
They can easily get out of control yeah you know what everybody did maintain.

2698
02:36:58.76 --> 02:37:05.76
Alright so so back to this PR you approve off that you're kind of like saying was a good one to highlight.

2699
02:37:05.76 --> 02:37:08.76
Yeah.

2700
02:37:08.76 --> 02:37:33.76
Pro the pro advisor team guy got this information right he says I just need you guys to come in and back me up because we had the stoners he had the mean some of those guys all they had with the carbines right and two carbines and maybe maybe one 16 and with those guys with the Vietnamese seals you might find an M 60 with the proves you wouldn't.

2701
02:37:33.76 --> 02:37:42.76
When stuff went down he can't call any American Air Force Air Force or Air support or any of that stuff and they don't fly.

2702
02:37:42.76 --> 02:37:48.76
Support for anybody they were doing everything like from the bush right kind of like guys who worked with the mountain yards right.

2703
02:37:48.76 --> 02:37:57.76
So he says I got this intel says Richard snatch these guys as you set up security says will throw them in the boats you guys.

2704
02:37:57.76 --> 02:38:06.76
Package them and we'll get away out of there will grab all of the because we could use our but we're using if we're going on the out he can use our boats right.

2705
02:38:06.76 --> 02:38:11.76
The time the sandpans alongside of them they can go so.

2706
02:38:11.76 --> 02:38:16.76
So here we are has been on the high in the back with the sandpan.

2707
02:38:16.76 --> 02:38:23.76
You ever paddle a sandpan no I have not they're like P Rose the you did a P row the like the guys in the.

2708
02:38:23.76 --> 02:38:29.76
The Cajuns down Louisiana I have a better one of those.

2709
02:38:29.76 --> 02:38:34.76
They're a bitch man so we're we're paddling is it like a salt like a canoe.

2710
02:38:34.76 --> 02:38:45.76
I've been in a canoe before like a canoe but the sandpans are like they got they're like flat bottom little thing and they go like this and they're they're pretty tilted right and you got a pal and I thought.

2711
02:38:45.76 --> 02:38:54.76
He really I thought he really knew about can what we're both figure we're sailors right we're frog man we figure anything else we're paddling with and the rivers are very very wide.

2712
02:38:54.76 --> 02:39:05.76
Hit this bank and kind of going like this we're following these guys up there so we're stroking trying to get up with them so then we go into an area and it was like.

2713
02:39:05.76 --> 02:39:14.76
Here's where the Hootches were right the Hootches right here so the Hootches are along the bank of the river right along the bank of the river so we came in we set up support.

2714
02:39:14.76 --> 02:39:20.76
So security for them he's got his proves his proves appear and then.

2715
02:39:20.76 --> 02:39:22.76
He's.

2716
02:39:22.76 --> 02:39:30.76
He says okay it's the same for corner security right anything that comes out the walls on the two corners you shoot him.

2717
02:39:30.76 --> 02:39:35.76
So we're all right you know because that's how we did it you know because in a Hootch.

2718
02:39:35.76 --> 02:39:43.76
If you don't have your your free fire you know the two corners is going to get hurt so when he comes out here you can you can shoot him these guys are going to shoot.

2719
02:39:43.76 --> 02:39:45.76
You know the four corners.

2720
02:39:45.76 --> 02:39:51.76
All right so we're sitting down here we paddle in.

2721
02:39:51.76 --> 02:39:53.76
Supposed to be quiet.

2722
02:39:53.76 --> 02:39:55.76
It turned out to be a John Wayne fight.

2723
02:39:55.76 --> 02:39:58.76
Oh do my luck you know and guys.

2724
02:39:58.76 --> 02:40:01.76
So John Wayne fight is where they know you're there.

2725
02:40:01.76 --> 02:40:06.76
It means when they got inside the cats they were in there were fighting back.

2726
02:40:06.76 --> 02:40:11.76
You know because there were Vietnamese they were the pro guys they weren't they weren't team guys you know they weren't.

2727
02:40:11.76 --> 02:40:18.76
They weren't us so the proves go into the village go into the into the Hootch and they get into a gunfight.

2728
02:40:18.76 --> 02:40:22.76
They get into a gun and fight fighting.

2729
02:40:22.76 --> 02:40:28.76
Okay so that goes fine out the Hootch and the guys on the corner you'll kill him right.

2730
02:40:28.76 --> 02:40:34.76
And so then there's a single on and then one guy comes out on our side running right in front of us black Mack.

2731
02:40:34.76 --> 02:40:37.76
This is the very first time I ever saw this right.

2732
02:40:37.76 --> 02:40:41.76
Had an M70 and grenade launcher right.

2733
02:40:41.76 --> 02:40:48.76
And usually if you're going through the like the dance jungle you carry the flichette rounds or the you know like canister rounds right.

2734
02:40:48.76 --> 02:40:52.76
Well this was kind of going to be in an open area so he did an HE round.

2735
02:40:52.76 --> 02:41:00.76
And this guy goes running they popped one flare then in the firefight.

2736
02:41:00.76 --> 02:41:02.76
There was the river goes right like this.

2737
02:41:02.76 --> 02:41:05.76
There were some people down here in Viet Cong right.

2738
02:41:05.76 --> 02:41:08.76
So we had the firefight they were getting hit over there.

2739
02:41:08.76 --> 02:41:10.76
These guys are running out the back.

2740
02:41:10.76 --> 02:41:16.76
Black Mack shoots this guy in the back with that grenade launcher.

2741
02:41:16.76 --> 02:41:21.76
And all I saw was two hands and two feet flying through the air.

2742
02:41:21.76 --> 02:41:25.76
And I remember going wow man wow.

2743
02:41:25.76 --> 02:41:30.76
You know how everything kind of goes slow motion and there's noise but it seems like it's quiet.

2744
02:41:30.76 --> 02:41:38.76
You know you know you I don't know the disconnect or whatever it's all just happening.

2745
02:41:38.76 --> 02:41:41.76
But you know you're OK right.

2746
02:41:41.76 --> 02:41:43.76
And everybody's calm about it.

2747
02:41:43.76 --> 02:41:47.76
And the guy who was running the captured just two guys right.

2748
02:41:47.76 --> 02:41:55.76
So when we had him packaged up these guys started opening up to where we were.

2749
02:41:55.76 --> 02:41:57.76
So Viet Cong started engaging you guys.

2750
02:41:57.76 --> 02:42:00.76
The Viet Cong that were a little bit off the target.

2751
02:42:00.76 --> 02:42:03.76
Right. They're engaging us but we need to go out over here.

2752
02:42:03.76 --> 02:42:08.76
So we grabbed the two bodies put it they threw them in because there was four guys.

2753
02:42:08.76 --> 02:42:14.76
This is the op where one of my friends said oh yeah I says didn't we capture some generals.

2754
02:42:14.76 --> 02:42:17.76
He wasn't even on the op.

2755
02:42:17.76 --> 02:42:19.76
And it was in the memorial day.

2756
02:42:19.76 --> 02:42:21.76
It was in the memorial day thing.

2757
02:42:21.76 --> 02:42:23.76
He shows it to me and go on.

2758
02:42:23.76 --> 02:42:26.76
So I go hi and I say was it generals who we captured.

2759
02:42:26.76 --> 02:42:31.76
And the other wasn't it's just some VC I think it was two VCI guys and a tax collector.

2760
02:42:31.76 --> 02:42:33.76
Because yeah that's what it was.

2761
02:42:33.76 --> 02:42:35.76
It says well so why.

2762
02:42:35.76 --> 02:42:40.76
I said because the guy who told me about the story says he said it was general.

2763
02:42:40.76 --> 02:42:43.76
He wasn't even on the op.

2764
02:42:43.76 --> 02:42:48.76
So because your stuff get and not and not that anybody's taking credit for it.

2765
02:42:48.76 --> 02:42:52.76
There's there's another op that one guy did try to take credit from me.

2766
02:42:52.76 --> 02:42:54.76
It's called the Donk story but.

2767
02:42:54.76 --> 02:42:58.76
Okay and another so in the meantime how do you get.

2768
02:42:58.76 --> 02:43:01.76
So you got to you got to leave the area of operations.

2769
02:43:01.76 --> 02:43:05.76
Right you have to go by this group of Viet Cong right that are engaging you.

2770
02:43:05.76 --> 02:43:07.76
Yeah and they're shooting over here right.

2771
02:43:07.76 --> 02:43:13.76
So then we didn't know that there's other guys on this side so they start shooting back at these guys.

2772
02:43:13.76 --> 02:43:16.76
So we had friendlies.

2773
02:43:16.76 --> 02:43:17.76
Those are friendlies up there.

2774
02:43:17.76 --> 02:43:18.76
No they're Viet Cong too.

2775
02:43:18.76 --> 02:43:22.76
Oh so that so there's Viet Cong on both sides of you on both sides of us.

2776
02:43:22.76 --> 02:43:24.76
Here's the place we're going out.

2777
02:43:24.76 --> 02:43:27.76
We have these guys here and we're paddling out between them.

2778
02:43:27.76 --> 02:43:31.76
So you're going to paddle out between Viet Cong on both sides.

2779
02:43:31.76 --> 02:43:32.76
Right.

2780
02:43:32.76 --> 02:43:33.76
This is not good.

2781
02:43:33.76 --> 02:43:34.76
This is not good.

2782
02:43:34.76 --> 02:43:37.76
The one thing that was good about it though it was a black night.

2783
02:43:37.76 --> 02:43:41.76
It was a dark night so we weren't silhouetted on the river right.

2784
02:43:41.76 --> 02:43:46.76
For the short time that the flare went up we saw what was going on.

2785
02:43:46.76 --> 02:43:49.76
We know we were going out so we took off.

2786
02:43:49.76 --> 02:43:57.76
But they had this thing going on and it was like I know there was one of those.

2787
02:43:57.76 --> 02:43:59.76
What the hell are we doing here right.

2788
02:43:59.76 --> 02:44:03.76
But by the time we got out on the river because there was a two Vietnamese

2789
02:44:03.76 --> 02:44:07.76
and then black mac and two Vietnamese in that of the third San Pan.

2790
02:44:07.76 --> 02:44:10.76
Me and Hyatt with our guys we passed everybody.

2791
02:44:10.76 --> 02:44:13.76
We were waiting out on the river for these guys to show up.

2792
02:44:13.76 --> 02:44:20.76
It was like where are we lost.

2793
02:44:20.76 --> 02:44:24.76
And then the boat because the radio was with Mac.

2794
02:44:24.76 --> 02:44:25.76
It was with black mac.

2795
02:44:25.76 --> 02:44:31.76
So he had the black mac the platoon commander or the assistant assistant.

2796
02:44:31.76 --> 02:44:35.76
And then he made you call him black mac because he was a black man.

2797
02:44:35.76 --> 02:44:39.76
We have black mac and we had pink mac macintosh.

2798
02:44:39.76 --> 02:44:40.76
You called pink.

2799
02:44:40.76 --> 02:44:42.76
You called Macintosh pink mac.

2800
02:44:42.76 --> 02:44:44.76
And we were talking and bimini too.

2801
02:44:44.76 --> 02:44:51.76
So I was you know echo is asking about macintosh and he was like you know he goes wait a second.

2802
02:44:51.76 --> 02:44:53.76
So was so was Macintosh a black guy.

2803
02:44:53.76 --> 02:44:56.76
And I said I was like no no he's a white guy.

2804
02:44:56.76 --> 02:44:58.76
He's white as me.

2805
02:44:58.76 --> 02:45:05.76
And then he asked you the same thing and you're like no he legitimately had his mom was legitimately black.

2806
02:45:05.76 --> 02:45:06.76
Right.

2807
02:45:06.76 --> 02:45:10.76
Well for me this was news and I knew like for a long time.

2808
02:45:10.76 --> 02:45:12.76
He had freckles.

2809
02:45:12.76 --> 02:45:13.76
His last name is Macintosh.

2810
02:45:13.76 --> 02:45:15.76
He looks like a complete white dude.

2811
02:45:15.76 --> 02:45:18.76
I mean it makes the story even fun.

2812
02:45:18.76 --> 02:45:20.76
You have to concentrate on his face.

2813
02:45:20.76 --> 02:45:23.76
You see the black features if you really start looking close.

2814
02:45:23.76 --> 02:45:27.76
I mean I knew him for a long time and hung out with him.

2815
02:45:27.76 --> 02:45:35.76
If you would ask me I never would have said that guy's black other than the fact that you know everyone knew he was like from the Virgin Islands.

2816
02:45:35.76 --> 02:45:36.76
Right.

2817
02:45:36.76 --> 02:45:41.76
And that was that's what I just figured he was some white guy you know that grew up there.

2818
02:45:41.76 --> 02:45:44.76
If you think about it that's the way seals are.

2819
02:45:44.76 --> 02:45:46.76
We think we know who they are but they're not.

2820
02:45:46.76 --> 02:45:47.76
Yeah.

2821
02:45:47.76 --> 02:45:48.76
Yeah.

2822
02:45:48.76 --> 02:45:51.76
Yeah we don't know.

2823
02:45:51.76 --> 02:46:02.76
But anyway we got we got those two guys out and it was a cool op and then the guy that was running the op he was just so happy because he'd been trying to get those guys for a long time.

2824
02:46:02.76 --> 02:46:03.76
So stuff changed.

2825
02:46:03.76 --> 02:46:04.76
It was always a dynamic.

2826
02:46:04.76 --> 02:46:06.76
The Intel was always dynamic.

2827
02:46:06.76 --> 02:46:09.76
So something that was good today was different.

2828
02:46:09.76 --> 02:46:15.76
I think it's kind of like some or kind of like the way the Afghans is what I'm understanding is they're moving all the time.

2829
02:46:15.76 --> 02:46:28.76
Yeah well you always have to adjust for that and it's interesting you know the fact that you know we're working with Iraqi soldiers or the I didn't fight in Afghanistan but guys that did work in Afghanistan had to deal with the same stuff.

2830
02:46:28.76 --> 02:46:41.76
You know you got these partner forces that you're working with some of them are most of them are good but you got four or five of those guys that are definitely suspect and you got two or three of them that are bad.

2831
02:46:41.76 --> 02:46:52.76
And you know one of my friends got shot up pretty bad by a guy that they thought was you know was there to go do a mission with him.

2832
02:46:52.76 --> 02:46:55.76
He's a special forces guy.

2833
02:46:55.76 --> 02:46:58.76
What about the what about the Donk op what happened with that one.

2834
02:46:58.76 --> 02:47:06.76
Oh that was that was going on the football island man and me tick the Vietnamese the kid that was sitting beside me.

2835
02:47:06.76 --> 02:47:08.76
I loved him man.

2836
02:47:08.76 --> 02:47:15.76
He was a guy who told me he said SP I'm off from my country what your country has for you.

2837
02:47:15.76 --> 02:47:25.76
Says you know says you seals you come and then you'll go.

2838
02:47:25.76 --> 02:47:26.76
This is where I'm going to die.

2839
02:47:26.76 --> 02:47:27.76
I'm a hell no tick.

2840
02:47:27.76 --> 02:47:28.76
So we're going to be together.

2841
02:47:28.76 --> 02:47:29.76
I'm going to get out.

2842
02:47:29.76 --> 02:47:35.76
I'll become an officer and I'll come back and I was even going to join the Vietnamese Navy SEAL team right.

2843
02:47:35.76 --> 02:47:39.76
That's that's where I was going with it but I needed a break too.

2844
02:47:39.76 --> 02:47:47.76
I wanted to get out of you know there's there's a thing where you realize that if you don't have you're not all in you're going to you're going to get killed.

2845
02:47:47.76 --> 02:48:03.76
And that's my respect for the cats like you and guys that have been in for 34 years that like Hayden like Hayden Chau Dica's guys like Frisk and crawdad and you know those guys.

2846
02:48:03.76 --> 02:48:11.76
Sometimes there's the little break of war between after Vietnam that space and it but then there's more of it.

2847
02:48:11.76 --> 02:48:27.76
But for me it was like I need to get I need to get out and I had the offer to wrestle at the University of Colorado so so there was with tick and so he says football Island was there was a bunch of cats there and we wanted to pull an up on it.

2848
02:48:27.76 --> 02:48:41.76
So what we did is we did three people three SEALs and tick got a little sandpan went up to football Island is not any wider than this the room.

2849
02:48:41.76 --> 02:48:43.76
So like 10 feet across 10 feet.

2850
02:48:43.76 --> 02:48:46.76
This is how big the river was or how big football Island was.

2851
02:48:46.76 --> 02:48:47.76
No that's how big the river was.

2852
02:48:47.76 --> 02:48:57.76
Football Island is probably about three clicks wide probably about two clicks three to two clicks you know wide and long.

2853
02:48:57.76 --> 02:49:03.76
But we didn't have a lot of intel on it and then during the day there was a lot of you know they would they would move around right.

2854
02:49:03.76 --> 02:49:06.76
So what we wanted to do is find out how many were there.

2855
02:49:06.76 --> 02:49:09.76
So we went in at night went in with the tide.

2856
02:49:09.76 --> 02:49:18.76
With the tide sandpan just the four of us went in called up the still river then then it narrowed probably to about that wide.

2857
02:49:18.76 --> 02:49:21.76
So like six feet six feet right.

2858
02:49:21.76 --> 02:49:29.76
But wait out was the big river and that's what we came in on we came in with an LSSC right with the sandpan attached to it.

2859
02:49:29.76 --> 02:49:36.76
So they launches they cruise on up the river and then we turned in and went did our ebop.

2860
02:49:36.76 --> 02:49:39.76
So we're in there and we're sneaking peak.

2861
02:49:39.76 --> 02:49:48.76
We got up there probably when we first reached the mouth of the river we heard.

2862
02:49:48.76 --> 02:49:54.76
So it was like oh oh that's that's that's them signaling that's a them signaling right.

2863
02:49:54.76 --> 02:49:57.76
But it was right near the bank where we were going up.

2864
02:49:57.76 --> 02:50:00.76
So sons of bitches are I mean they're right there right.

2865
02:50:00.76 --> 02:50:05.76
So we stayed low low low paddle paddle and I just kept going went by him probably about.

2866
02:50:05.76 --> 02:50:10.76
Two minutes three minutes up you know not that far up maybe.

2867
02:50:10.76 --> 02:50:12.76
Maybe about five minutes.

2868
02:50:12.76 --> 02:50:17.76
So then we got to where it was easy to pull in there was like a like a shallow bank that we can get in.

2869
02:50:17.76 --> 02:50:22.76
So we harbored up the boat and we crawled up.

2870
02:50:22.76 --> 02:50:25.76
Picking up like picking up and looking and Jesus.

2871
02:50:25.76 --> 02:50:31.76
And those cats were smoking cigarettes they had their weapons kind of stacked and talking.

2872
02:50:31.76 --> 02:50:37.76
And then there was this thing that went like this how many probably about 50.

2873
02:50:37.76 --> 02:50:38.76
That's a big group of cats.

2874
02:50:38.76 --> 02:50:40.76
That's a big group of cats.

2875
02:50:40.76 --> 02:50:41.76
You know there were.

2876
02:50:41.76 --> 02:50:44.76
Did you have a stoner anyone have a 60.

2877
02:50:44.76 --> 02:50:50.76
Well no no no we're going to see that four stoners three stoners and tick with 16.

2878
02:50:50.76 --> 02:50:53.76
So we could we could have five.

2879
02:50:53.76 --> 02:50:56.76
Yeah but we don't we're not there for that.

2880
02:50:56.76 --> 02:51:03.76
So we'd hear this you know just but it was like a like a dog made like a real hollow sound.

2881
02:51:03.76 --> 02:51:15.76
It was a little piece of wood little piece of wood like this had two serpents heads had a hole drilled through it and then there was a line that was cut out that would make that hollow sound.

2882
02:51:15.76 --> 02:51:17.76
Okay this is almost like a percussion instrument.

2883
02:51:17.76 --> 02:51:21.76
Yeah but it had a place where your thumb would fit and when your finger would fit.

2884
02:51:21.76 --> 02:51:24.76
I didn't know it at the time we just heard it.

2885
02:51:24.76 --> 02:51:30.76
So then we get up there and we're laying out on the river we hear this.

2886
02:51:30.76 --> 02:51:51.76
Oh well the boat was in we were up to just we were we were just kind of hanging out for probably about 40 minutes maybe maybe now we caught it just when the tide was full and then it started running out right.

2887
02:51:51.76 --> 02:51:56.76
Well the cats out on the river hooked up on a barge I mean on a sandbar.

2888
02:51:56.76 --> 02:52:02.76
So the Vietnamese guys are there and they're going and then one guy was hitting his little dunk.

2889
02:52:02.76 --> 02:52:06.76
He said oh sounds like the Americans are stuck.

2890
02:52:06.76 --> 02:52:13.76
Yeah and then one guy says should we go we should get the guys and we'll go kill him.

2891
02:52:13.76 --> 02:52:17.76
We're just hanging out here you know and let's just take a break.

2892
02:52:17.76 --> 02:52:24.76
Let's let him live tonight and so Tick was like we're going to have to get out of here right.

2893
02:52:24.76 --> 02:52:29.76
So this one guy gets up and says I'm going to take a leak.

2894
02:52:29.76 --> 02:52:34.76
So he goes over with the little thing and I'm laying here and Hite's laying there and he takes this thing and he puts it down.

2895
02:52:34.76 --> 02:52:36.76
This is the percussion instrument thing.

2896
02:52:36.76 --> 02:52:40.76
Yeah he puts it down and so then Hite was a platoon leader right.

2897
02:52:40.76 --> 02:52:42.76
He's one he's calling the op.

2898
02:52:42.76 --> 02:52:45.76
I'm here Tick's here and Rich is over here.

2899
02:52:45.76 --> 02:52:48.76
So Hite said well let's go.

2900
02:52:48.76 --> 02:52:52.76
So I'm sitting and I look and he laid it when he laid it down.

2901
02:52:52.76 --> 02:52:56.76
He was like right in front of me and then he started pissing between me and Hite.

2902
02:52:56.76 --> 02:53:01.76
So I'm like this guy like this like you know you can feel the like rain fitting on the top of your head.

2903
02:53:01.76 --> 02:53:04.76
I'm sitting there going son of a bitch.

2904
02:53:04.76 --> 02:53:05.76
And so the other guy said hey.

2905
02:53:05.76 --> 02:53:08.76
Chá Tây said who took your cigarette.

2906
02:53:08.76 --> 02:53:09.76
Oh yeah.

2907
02:53:09.76 --> 02:53:12.76
So he turns around goes back over and gives this guy a cigarette.

2908
02:53:12.76 --> 02:53:16.76
Hi Hite let's move man I grabbed that thing put it in my pocket.

2909
02:53:16.76 --> 02:53:23.76
We slid out and then we're on the low look where the the current is starting to move out.

2910
02:53:23.76 --> 02:53:24.76
So it was pretty cool.

2911
02:53:24.76 --> 02:53:27.76
So we weren't like we were going out with it.

2912
02:53:27.76 --> 02:53:32.76
Those boats are on so we get out there and then we pass by the guy the shot.

2913
02:53:32.76 --> 02:53:41.76
You know I was like and I didn't I didn't really understand it but then Lou he says I can feel the fucking bullets going in.

2914
02:53:41.76 --> 02:53:44.76
In my back man he said I could just feel them all the way.

2915
02:53:44.76 --> 02:53:48.76
We just get that it's not reality right.

2916
02:53:48.76 --> 02:54:03.76
There are things that I'll get into that little bit later but so we went out and it was so dark that when those guys were still sitting there we pulled the boat up there and was hey.

2917
02:54:03.76 --> 02:54:08.76
So let us push you off we pushed them off the bars and then we took off but I had that dog I put it in my pocket.

2918
02:54:08.76 --> 02:54:24.76
So I told the story to a buddy of mine Andy Willingham team guy and he says cool man and I showed him the little thing you know because I brought it back and then he was in class 41 tough guy man.

2919
02:54:24.76 --> 02:54:35.76
Just actually he had a tussle with the guy I'm not going to say the guy's name but he's East Coast guy the real high end that ran a lot officer that is high profile and shit.

2920
02:54:35.76 --> 02:54:44.76
We're in the trade wind bar and he's starting this East Coast West Coast bullshit and Andy Willingham tells him you know you don't shut the fuck up I want to knock you out.

2921
02:54:44.76 --> 02:54:57.76
Andy's dad used to bit money with all these guys down in South and he was a relative of Strom Thurman and he used to knock donkeys out with that 16 punch.

2922
02:54:57.76 --> 02:55:05.76
Well the guy goes what out drinks his beer says I'll catch you later as we take off.

2923
02:55:05.76 --> 02:55:14.76
That guy's a very famous East Coast seal you know big name high name that's never going to be in the history books but that's how things happen then you know it wasn't.

2924
02:55:14.76 --> 02:55:22.76
You know the guys that are high order top end dudes with the big reputations and stuff like that.

2925
02:55:22.76 --> 02:55:27.76
They're just regular guys you're just a regular cat.

2926
02:55:27.76 --> 02:55:37.76
We're all like that and I think the sense of where the media gets hold of this thing and sensationalize everything about you know where.

2927
02:55:37.76 --> 02:55:42.76
That we are anti magnetic genuine role I mean all of that stuff right.

2928
02:55:42.76 --> 02:55:47.76
But when you when you're going to screw with the frog man and you're out somewhere.

2929
02:55:47.76 --> 02:55:49.76
You're not going to just have to kick the hell out of one guy.

2930
02:55:49.76 --> 02:55:52.76
You're going to be 10 guys with him.

2931
02:55:52.76 --> 02:55:59.76
You don't have to prove that you know I mean this is this is where the power is that everybody knows that right.

2932
02:55:59.76 --> 02:56:06.76
And when it goes down where's the calmness you know and you know.

2933
02:56:06.76 --> 02:56:12.76
The one thing is that in the millisecond of time.

2934
02:56:12.76 --> 02:56:15.76
You're both a coward and a hero.

2935
02:56:15.76 --> 02:56:22.76
And you want yourself find yourself somewhere you want to hold I get here when you can run as fast backwards as you can run forward.

2936
02:56:22.76 --> 02:56:26.76
And each one of the instances look alike they smell alike but they're not alike.

2937
02:56:26.76 --> 02:56:34.76
You know it's a totally different thing and each one has its own evolution the same as a fire has its own character has its own.

2938
02:56:34.76 --> 02:56:39.76
And what what I used to say in Vietnam is not the thing you see that's going to kill you.

2939
02:56:39.76 --> 02:56:43.76
And I tell my guys in the fire department it's not the thing you see that's going to kill you.

2940
02:56:43.76 --> 02:56:48.76
What is it's the thing that's sniffing around with Jocko's name on it.

2941
02:56:48.76 --> 02:56:53.76
It's going where is he and that's where the training comes in.

2942
02:56:53.76 --> 02:57:02.76
And if you have the training then you have the millisecond of saying and there's that spiritual thing this is we're in the wrong place or don't.

2943
02:57:02.76 --> 02:57:07.76
And when I look at ops that you know like that like our new guys now you guys right the young guys that get killed in Afghanistan.

2944
02:57:07.76 --> 02:57:14.76
We're acts like where was the discussion. That was pretty jacked up from the beginning.

2945
02:57:14.76 --> 02:57:21.76
But because we are who we are we give the space and time to say I wasn't there. They were there.

2946
02:57:21.76 --> 02:57:29.76
That's their that's their op and and however it went however it went sour whatever happened.

2947
02:57:29.76 --> 02:57:33.76
It's the thing that was sniffing for them and they didn't see it.

2948
02:57:33.76 --> 02:57:38.76
You know no matter how well trained you are sometimes it's just not there.

2949
02:57:38.76 --> 02:57:46.76
What did you do with with Mac with with Sog did you work. Did you do sog any sog operations.

2950
02:57:46.76 --> 02:57:49.76
The Mac vs. sog thing was the proofing.

2951
02:57:49.76 --> 02:57:52.76
OK so that they had that was there that was there.

2952
02:57:52.76 --> 02:57:54.76
Yeah that's their that's their thing. Yeah.

2953
02:57:54.76 --> 02:57:56.76
Got it. So those are the ones you know what it was.

2954
02:57:56.76 --> 02:57:58.76
They just hit me and Bill over there.

2955
02:57:58.76 --> 02:58:03.76
You go under these guys are leaving take over. We're like all right. You know.

2956
02:58:03.76 --> 02:58:09.76
And the only reason they sent us for that is because I was with the Vietnamese seals with two East Coast guys.

2957
02:58:09.76 --> 02:58:13.76
And I worked that so then it was kind of like hey we want you to because I could speak.

2958
02:58:13.76 --> 02:58:17.76
I spoke better Vietnamese and I did Spanish. You know.

2959
02:58:17.76 --> 02:58:25.76
So you just pick it up from pick it up from the point men from from tick and quan and unlock and all the guys.

2960
02:58:25.76 --> 02:58:30.76
All the guys that I operated with were Vietnamese seals that all the rest of the Americans operated with.

2961
02:58:30.76 --> 02:58:36.76
So when Tick said yeah I'm going to be here but you guys are going to leave us and I'll probably die here.

2962
02:58:36.76 --> 02:58:45.76
All of them were killed. Lock home tick all these guys.

2963
02:58:45.76 --> 02:58:48.76
So that's how I picked it up.

2964
02:58:48.76 --> 02:58:50.76
There are guys that went to Vietnamese language school.

2965
02:58:50.76 --> 02:58:53.76
They didn't send me I spoke better Vietnamese than I did.

2966
02:58:53.76 --> 02:59:00.76
Then the guys who went to Vietnamese language school because a personalized Macintosh could speak to Gallow.

2967
02:59:00.76 --> 02:59:07.76
Because he in Vietnam he had the little thing on learning all the all the to Gallow phrases right.

2968
02:59:07.76 --> 02:59:19.76
And so I was invested with tick and I was invested with the liberation of South Vietnam.

2969
02:59:19.76 --> 02:59:26.76
I think there were a lot of I think there were a lot of Vietnamese a lot of seal team guys Vietnam seals that that's how they felt.

2970
02:59:26.76 --> 02:59:31.76
And then after it went down I mean I talked to some guys I said well yeah I'd like to go back someday.

2971
02:59:31.76 --> 02:59:35.76
And I had some partners this and so I didn't leave a damn thing over there.

2972
02:59:35.76 --> 02:59:38.76
There's no reason for me to ever go back there.

2973
02:59:38.76 --> 02:59:46.76
And I think what happens is there's a romance.

2974
02:59:46.76 --> 02:59:53.76
There's a who are you romanticize the memories right.

2975
02:59:53.76 --> 02:59:55.76
People romanticize wars.

2976
02:59:55.76 --> 03:00:00.76
They were romanticized of what it is or they think about what it is.

2977
03:00:00.76 --> 03:00:08.76
I think those of us to be there see the nakedness of it you know see the deal right the flash of that changes your life.

2978
03:00:08.76 --> 03:00:10.76
That changes everybody's life.

2979
03:00:10.76 --> 03:00:23.76
And we think sometimes that you can only see that in war we got people in communities that that are going through the same thing of trying going through post-traumatic stress in their own neighborhoods you know.

2980
03:00:23.76 --> 03:00:35.76
And but what I went through is giving me language to what happened in my life that I'm now able through reevaluation counseling is one where I have the picture of who I am as a human being.

2981
03:00:35.76 --> 03:00:45.76
And I think advanced reticular therapies the vision thing that some guys are doing that they gave me a mental pictures of where I'm going.

2982
03:00:45.76 --> 03:00:56.76
And then this ladies really helped me with her thing is called rewired creator but where I've come to the point where I'm not going to settle for that.

2983
03:00:56.76 --> 03:01:05.76
And like I said earlier you know my convictions and my wants need to be stronger than the alternatives that I settled for in the past that it's okay to do this.

2984
03:01:05.76 --> 03:01:07.76
You know I can't do that anymore.

2985
03:01:07.76 --> 03:01:11.76
And I got to forgive myself for the sins of my past right.

2986
03:01:11.76 --> 03:01:17.76
That's a big end when I was in Coronado this last time through reunion.

2987
03:01:17.76 --> 03:01:21.76
I go there I go to Denny's bar and I have a beer with Mario Maestes.

2988
03:01:21.76 --> 03:01:25.76
I mentored him I was his wrestling coach in Colorado right.

2989
03:01:25.76 --> 03:01:33.76
I do and I'd wrestle him and then be like okay you know when you're wrestling the guy and you know he's getting stronger and tougher and then you go.

2990
03:01:33.76 --> 03:01:36.76
Oh shit I hang out here a little bit more he's gonna beat the hell out of me.

2991
03:01:36.76 --> 03:01:45.76
That was that was him you know and I.

2992
03:01:45.76 --> 03:01:53.76
That that family and that relationship and what we create for each other.

2993
03:01:53.76 --> 03:02:04.76
It's beyond just the happening it's all it's beyond just being a frogman it's there's the whole spiritual connection to those old UDT guys that they know shit they went and they picked up can you swim yeah.

2994
03:02:04.76 --> 03:02:10.76
I remember asking one of my old guys World War two guys this is what did you kind of weapons you carry.

2995
03:02:10.76 --> 03:02:16.76
Well I started my cribbers my swimming trunks and my flair.

2996
03:02:16.76 --> 03:02:24.76
I said what about weapons so we're just doing drop and pick up says if you miss the boat says you're swimming in with the fleet.

2997
03:02:24.76 --> 03:02:30.76
You know with with the guys that are laying on the beaches and there's usually a marine laying around you can just take his weapon he didn't care.

2998
03:02:30.76 --> 03:02:42.76
That was their character that was that's who we're born from right that's what the tadpole the frog you know that.

2999
03:02:42.76 --> 03:02:49.76
And she's stone man we live in a reputation of dead man like the people they're gonna sit there and say oh that's your reputation right.

3000
03:02:49.76 --> 03:02:56.76
But each one of our generations those guys behind is are building their own generation.

3001
03:02:56.76 --> 03:03:00.76
They're building their building where's it gonna go.

3002
03:03:00.76 --> 03:03:12.76
If it's left to the people that operate that tobacco Lewis when I came back I was by myself he's sitting there in the trade wind bar.

3003
03:03:12.76 --> 03:03:16.76
I look at him I come in and go shit they still sitting there.

3004
03:03:16.76 --> 03:03:19.76
Yes he has.

3005
03:03:19.76 --> 03:03:23.76
So I come over to him say hey man how you doing.

3006
03:03:23.76 --> 03:03:30.76
He grabs a pitcher beer.

3007
03:03:30.76 --> 03:03:40.76
There's I understand we're a pretty good badass little operator.

3008
03:03:40.76 --> 03:03:42.76
Take my drink right.

3009
03:03:42.76 --> 03:03:52.76
See where is the transition to being called that not calling you and you couldn't I didn't like now it's called seal operators nobody would ever have called themselves an operator.

3010
03:03:52.76 --> 03:03:58.76
The person that could call you an operator is yourself is your teammates the guys that were with you.

3011
03:03:58.76 --> 03:04:07.76
And when they say that and somebody else says it to you it never came from you it came from the cats that were with you and there's some cats.

3012
03:04:07.76 --> 03:04:13.76
They were never called operators they're Vietnam their seals Vietnam guys are team guys but.

3013
03:04:13.76 --> 03:04:22.76
Not at that level but whatever level that is and it isn't mean to.

3014
03:04:22.76 --> 03:04:29.76
To put one type of operator over another operator you know it's just that you are not not better than all the rest of the operators in the world.

3015
03:04:29.76 --> 03:04:33.76
Because then then become then it becomes the ego thing.

3016
03:04:33.76 --> 03:04:35.76
But from here.

3017
03:04:35.76 --> 03:04:38.76
If somebody calls you that and you almost cry.

3018
03:04:38.76 --> 03:04:48.76
It means something you know and I went you know have my drink with him and.

3019
03:04:48.76 --> 03:04:58.76
You know and I had you know you have these these guys that they say that are bigger than life and actually are not bigger than life they're people that know how to connect with you.

3020
03:04:58.76 --> 03:05:02.76
That are.

3021
03:05:02.76 --> 03:05:12.76
They give you life more than anything you go yeah I can do that I can be this Oliver chief Allen Barry Enoch you know.

3022
03:05:12.76 --> 03:05:17.76
No I was fortunate man I I walked with some.

3023
03:05:17.76 --> 03:05:20.76
I walked with some good people you know.

3024
03:05:20.76 --> 03:05:26.76
Did you guys did your platoon did you lose anybody and your deployment doc doc Maynard.

3025
03:05:26.76 --> 03:05:32.76
Transfer he rotated with the army corps was a Marine Corpsman.

3026
03:05:32.76 --> 03:05:37.76
So that the Marine Corpsman could get some money right do the ship over stuff.

3027
03:05:37.76 --> 03:05:48.76
And he was the one that was walking by with Van Hoy Doc Maynard and Van Hoy were walking by when they drilled out that 82 millimeter mortar and killed five seals.

3028
03:05:48.76 --> 03:05:51.76
And he just happened to be there.

3029
03:05:51.76 --> 03:05:56.76
It's walking by and then they had to put I wasn't there because I was working with the Pruse.

3030
03:05:56.76 --> 03:05:59.76
But another buddy my name D.

3031
03:05:59.76 --> 03:06:02.76
They were having a party you know they they're changing out.

3032
03:06:02.76 --> 03:06:05.76
I was the other thing that was crazy.

3033
03:06:05.76 --> 03:06:13.76
But anyway at that party because we were coming over and they just had a party and they were still doing a little bit more operations.

3034
03:06:13.76 --> 03:06:18.76
And Van Hoy told these is I'm gonna get killed here this time.

3035
03:06:18.76 --> 03:06:22.76
What the hell is that what are you talking about. These guys are careless.

3036
03:06:22.76 --> 03:06:24.76
They're dangerous.

3037
03:06:24.76 --> 03:06:26.76
Says enough talk to him about stuff.

3038
03:06:26.76 --> 03:06:29.76
He says but we're going to mess up.

3039
03:06:29.76 --> 03:06:31.76
And they did.

3040
03:06:31.76 --> 03:06:34.76
And he had already like three or four trips.

3041
03:06:34.76 --> 03:06:35.76
You know.

3042
03:06:35.76 --> 03:06:42.76
And and he was one he was one of he was a cool Van Hoy was he was a rock star.

3043
03:06:42.76 --> 03:06:52.76
And you get me was the very first time we go to Vietnam going to release relieve of Patoon and they grab you like this.

3044
03:06:52.76 --> 03:06:56.76
Hey are you doing your espionage.

3045
03:06:56.76 --> 03:06:58.76
Look what.

3046
03:06:58.76 --> 03:07:02.76
I think I'm shaking hands with the dead man.

3047
03:07:02.76 --> 03:07:05.76
That's why you think that's funny.

3048
03:07:05.76 --> 03:07:08.76
You know they would do those kind of things you know.

3049
03:07:08.76 --> 03:07:15.76
And so then I did it when I left.

3050
03:07:15.76 --> 03:07:20.76
So how was it coming home.

3051
03:07:20.76 --> 03:07:25.76
Did you think you were going back to another platoon like you're going to do it again.

3052
03:07:25.76 --> 03:07:28.76
What point did you make the decision like that you're going to get out.

3053
03:07:28.76 --> 03:07:35.76
I got the letter to Russell to University of Colorado which was always one of my dreams because I was raised in Boulder.

3054
03:07:35.76 --> 03:07:43.76
And I thought man I'd live to Russell to University of Colorado babes and booze in Boulder my hometown or bombs bullets and bullshit.

3055
03:07:43.76 --> 03:07:49.76
I guess I guess I had on the lips and I said hey man I'm going to get you later because I got I wasn't ready.

3056
03:07:49.76 --> 03:07:50.76
I wasn't right.

3057
03:07:50.76 --> 03:07:59.76
You know I felt that I felt that thing that if I go back again I might get whacked and I needed to I needed that time away.

3058
03:07:59.76 --> 03:08:00.76
You know.

3059
03:08:00.76 --> 03:08:04.76
And if I had that space and I had that time and I wasn't ready then I'm cheating.

3060
03:08:04.76 --> 03:08:10.76
I may be the wink link in you let down the team in another's operation.

3061
03:08:10.76 --> 03:08:12.76
So I'd rather not be there right.

3062
03:08:12.76 --> 03:08:24.76
And so yeah and saying goodbye to those guys was really hard you know.

3063
03:08:24.76 --> 03:08:31.76
And then all the other stuff you know there's the people talk about some of the movements that are coming now about gender and all that other kind of stuff.

3064
03:08:31.76 --> 03:08:44.76
You know we dealt with that in the teams a long time before that you know we're gay guys or whatever it is you know the like in community you know we allow for everybody to exist.

3065
03:08:44.76 --> 03:08:48.76
Not in the teams I mean in the teams it was all but we were in California.

3066
03:08:48.76 --> 03:08:58.76
So I mean all the stuff they're talking about now is already all the gay thing the whole all of that stuff is so when I went to school to see you there was a lot of people trying to surprise you about things.

3067
03:08:58.76 --> 03:09:01.76
The Viva La Rasa thing about how violent they are.

3068
03:09:01.76 --> 03:09:11.76
I'm back from Vietnam is like you know wait a minute you know I did I.

3069
03:09:11.76 --> 03:09:20.76
Vietnam veterans against war the young social street public the Viva the Azzalan thing is like and I was raised in Boulder right.

3070
03:09:20.76 --> 03:09:27.76
All this stuff's going down I'm like what happened in my life when I was a kid felt like my days were black and white days.

3071
03:09:27.76 --> 03:09:36.76
Vietnam is a green and black when I came home is all technicolor man all chicks getting come and ask if you want sex.

3072
03:09:36.76 --> 03:09:50.76
You know like what happened you know this free love and all that other like where's where's the moral conviction where's those things it was like there weren't there weren't any there's what year was it that you got out 69 and 70 I got back in Vietnam.

3073
03:09:50.76 --> 03:09:58.76
So it's just like the height of mayhem in America. Yeah yeah that whole thing was going down and.

3074
03:09:58.76 --> 03:10:01.76
I remember.

3075
03:10:01.76 --> 03:10:05.76
At a party this guy was talking about.

3076
03:10:05.76 --> 03:10:08.76
The the Chicano movement right.

3077
03:10:08.76 --> 03:10:18.76
As there was another kid there he was from Del Norte and I'm listening to him this guy for corn was.

3078
03:10:18.76 --> 03:10:27.76
Really an activist I said well I don't agree with I think it's kind of bullshit you know because I just killed a commie from mommy I'm back here.

3079
03:10:27.76 --> 03:10:31.76
I'm from Boulder and and I said well you're a sellout.

3080
03:10:31.76 --> 03:10:42.76
I'm a sellout because I love my country because of what I did and this kid Marty Martinez he says yeah he can say whatever he wants any backhands him.

3081
03:10:42.76 --> 03:10:48.76
So that's kind of a cheap thing in it so you don't like it let's go outdoors.

3082
03:10:48.76 --> 03:10:50.76
Sorry so we go outdoors.

3083
03:10:50.76 --> 03:10:55.76
And I forgot where I was right.

3084
03:10:55.76 --> 03:11:01.76
So I walked out and soon as the other time that the outside warrior kind of got the upper hand a little bit.

3085
03:11:01.76 --> 03:11:07.76
Well what happened what happened was he hit me right so I turned and I looked at him.

3086
03:11:07.76 --> 03:11:13.76
And I said you I've been slapped by women harder than you can you just hit me.

3087
03:11:13.76 --> 03:11:20.76
I says just stand by because I'm going to kick out of these three guys first your little girlfriends and then you.

3088
03:11:20.76 --> 03:11:28.76
Oh no no man says you got to then it was reminding me back when I was in junior high fight this guy and then they go oh no you're OK you're cool.

3089
03:11:28.76 --> 03:11:30.76
I said bullshit.

3090
03:11:30.76 --> 03:11:39.76
I says you are manipulating these young kids into what you think it is but they're not but they're being manipulated and it's not creative thought.

3091
03:11:39.76 --> 03:11:50.76
I said so I want to what no no you're close no no I'm gonna go back in the party me and Freddie I says you come back in there I'm going to kick you inside there out.

3092
03:11:50.76 --> 03:11:56.76
I says a matter of fact when I go to a party if you're there you better leave and if I'm there don't come in.

3093
03:11:56.76 --> 03:12:04.76
Later on he got killed by threatening some old guy in New Mexico right so I didn't fit.

3094
03:12:04.76 --> 03:12:06.76
Ask my dad.

3095
03:12:06.76 --> 03:12:09.76
Hey man I said I did I screw up.

3096
03:12:09.76 --> 03:12:12.76
Vietnam and all that.

3097
03:12:12.76 --> 03:12:15.76
My dad I love him man.

3098
03:12:15.76 --> 03:12:20.76
He's the guy to grab my face you know tell me I was don't be afraid right.

3099
03:12:20.76 --> 03:12:23.76
And my last name is the only thing I gave you.

3100
03:12:23.76 --> 03:12:31.76
So he takes me over and makes me stand in the school we put tiles in the bathroom not the stick I'm kind of not not this court you mean.

3101
03:12:31.76 --> 03:12:35.76
So we did that and he had me stand there and.

3102
03:12:35.76 --> 03:12:43.76
This is after Vietnam after you asked him if you if you had screwed up this is when I was going to school at CU right because I came home and they were still there.

3103
03:12:43.76 --> 03:12:47.76
Before my dad told me we're moving I said why are you moving.

3104
03:12:47.76 --> 03:12:49.76
We're afraid of you.

3105
03:12:49.76 --> 03:12:51.76
We think you're going to kill us.

3106
03:12:51.76 --> 03:12:54.76
I see why what do you mean.

3107
03:12:54.76 --> 03:13:01.76
He says the way you are the behavior the way you look at us the way you carry yourself sometimes says we think you could kill us.

3108
03:13:01.76 --> 03:13:06.76
That's when I understood where the that's where the outside worse are looking to go what though.

3109
03:13:06.76 --> 03:13:14.76
And there's another couple other things I'll get to a little bit later about what happened but he had me stand there.

3110
03:13:14.76 --> 03:13:30.76
He says you know the way we are as people he says the man can say that they own the rivers the mountains the valleys even the buildings that they built says the air or to see.

3111
03:13:30.76 --> 03:13:33.76
He says but they don't.

3112
03:13:33.76 --> 03:13:36.76
But I want to tell you something.

3113
03:13:36.76 --> 03:13:39.76
That's quartile that you're standing on.

3114
03:13:39.76 --> 03:13:46.76
Everywhere you walk give me that's when he'd love me when he called me give you give is different than SP you know and go.

3115
03:13:46.76 --> 03:13:50.76
He says everywhere you walk.

3116
03:13:50.76 --> 03:13:56.76
It's paid for by you by the blood of yours and your friends.

3117
03:13:56.76 --> 03:13:59.76
He says and you did it for your family.

3118
03:13:59.76 --> 03:14:00.76
You did it from your heart.

3119
03:14:00.76 --> 03:14:04.76
So it's paid for us too.

3120
03:14:04.76 --> 03:14:12.76
He says you never be ashamed about what you did and who you are because that you own it.

3121
03:14:12.76 --> 03:14:15.76
So when I walk into a village this place right here right now.

3122
03:14:15.76 --> 03:14:16.76
This is mine.

3123
03:14:16.76 --> 03:14:19.76
This is your this is yours.

3124
03:14:19.76 --> 03:14:22.76
But this little chair here.

3125
03:14:22.76 --> 03:14:23.76
It's mine.

3126
03:14:23.76 --> 03:14:33.76
And I didn't understand that but somebody has to tell you so that you do invite to add fourth grade education told me in the Indian way you know.

3127
03:14:33.76 --> 03:14:38.76
And he gave me so much power.

3128
03:14:38.76 --> 03:14:43.76
When I came back I didn't fit.

3129
03:14:43.76 --> 03:14:46.76
So when I wrestled they see you.

3130
03:14:46.76 --> 03:14:48.76
It was just wrestling.

3131
03:14:48.76 --> 03:14:49.76
I'm saying I couldn't get it.

3132
03:14:49.76 --> 03:14:51.76
I had to go to I had to go to five.

3133
03:14:51.76 --> 03:14:53.76
I went to the nationals two times.

3134
03:14:53.76 --> 03:14:55.76
If I beat this one guy I would have been sixth in the nation.

3135
03:14:55.76 --> 03:14:56.76
Right.

3136
03:14:56.76 --> 03:14:57.76
But he ran.

3137
03:14:57.76 --> 03:15:02.76
I beat a national champ that another guy knows but they they ripped me off.

3138
03:15:02.76 --> 03:15:07.76
And actually when my wrestling coach talked to this guy I said why'd that happen.

3139
03:15:07.76 --> 03:15:10.76
He said I just couldn't let that Mexican kid beat this kid.

3140
03:15:10.76 --> 03:15:11.76
Right.

3141
03:15:11.76 --> 03:15:12.76
All right.

3142
03:15:12.76 --> 03:15:13.76
I understood that.

3143
03:15:13.76 --> 03:15:17.76
No big I'm a frog man you know I fought for my country.

3144
03:15:17.76 --> 03:15:25.76
You know I.

3145
03:15:25.76 --> 03:15:31.76
I just fortunate I had a pop that told me that you know when I went hunting with him one time later as a man.

3146
03:15:31.76 --> 03:15:36.76
We killed an elk.

3147
03:15:36.76 --> 03:15:37.76
I was just back.

3148
03:15:37.76 --> 03:15:39.76
I was probably not as later.

3149
03:15:39.76 --> 03:15:51.76
And we were getting him up he says give me he says you hunt in this is you go up over the ridges and you scared out an elk and and I'll kill him.

3150
03:15:51.76 --> 03:15:52.76
It's all right.

3151
03:15:52.76 --> 03:15:54.76
So I'm up there walking up on this.

3152
03:15:54.76 --> 03:15:57.76
He wouldn't mind my mom was going to let him go.

3153
03:15:57.76 --> 03:16:02.76
But she said he said what if Gibby goes with me.

3154
03:16:02.76 --> 03:16:05.76
Well if Gibby goes with you can go.

3155
03:16:05.76 --> 03:16:06.76
I said dad I don't want to go.

3156
03:16:06.76 --> 03:16:10.76
He says you you go with me and said all right.

3157
03:16:10.76 --> 03:16:16.76
So he tells me this order you go up on top he says you chase down the elk and I'll kill him and we'll be you know.

3158
03:16:16.76 --> 03:16:17.76
It's all right.

3159
03:16:17.76 --> 03:16:19.76
So I'm up there humping.

3160
03:16:19.76 --> 03:16:20.76
I'm like 47 years old.

3161
03:16:20.76 --> 03:16:24.76
I could feel my heart you know like when you're on ambush or something like that and you feel your heart beating in your head.

3162
03:16:24.76 --> 03:16:28.76
You're neck you know I think I'm going to have a heart attack up here.

3163
03:16:28.76 --> 03:16:32.76
Mine dad is not coming up here and they're going to find me a bag of bones right.

3164
03:16:32.76 --> 03:16:36.76
So anyway I came down and he was driving.

3165
03:16:36.76 --> 03:16:37.76
Yeah.

3166
03:16:37.76 --> 03:16:39.76
So I got in here I put my weapon here.

3167
03:16:39.76 --> 03:16:42.76
You're supposed to have your weapon but where you're hunting right with you.

3168
03:16:42.76 --> 03:16:44.76
So we drive.

3169
03:16:44.76 --> 03:16:46.76
So I went around the truck.

3170
03:16:46.76 --> 03:16:49.76
As soon as I got hold the door I heard the sound man.

3171
03:16:49.76 --> 03:16:52.76
Somebody shooting at us went right over my head.

3172
03:16:52.76 --> 03:16:54.76
Two of them.

3173
03:16:54.76 --> 03:16:56.76
And I said what's going on.

3174
03:16:56.76 --> 03:17:00.76
I said oh Papa whatever's happening they're shooting at us.

3175
03:17:00.76 --> 03:17:04.76
And then I grabbed his weapon so I'm going to shoot somebody.

3176
03:17:04.76 --> 03:17:08.76
He goes no no no he says there's the elk it's coming this way.

3177
03:17:08.76 --> 03:17:12.76
So instinctively I drew up I was going to shoot the elk in my day.

3178
03:17:12.76 --> 03:17:14.76
No no no he said that's my gun.

3179
03:17:14.76 --> 03:17:17.76
And when we went my dad I said dad I don't want a gun.

3180
03:17:17.76 --> 03:17:19.76
He says no I'm just going to be with you.

3181
03:17:19.76 --> 03:17:22.76
I'm going to have in case you get hurt some you got a gun.

3182
03:17:22.76 --> 03:17:25.76
So alright so he locked and loaded the round for me.

3183
03:17:25.76 --> 03:17:26.76
I shoot.

3184
03:17:26.76 --> 03:17:28.76
Clipped him like this.

3185
03:17:28.76 --> 03:17:30.76
I took the second shot.

3186
03:17:30.76 --> 03:17:32.76
And then I was locked and loaded and I'm running.

3187
03:17:32.76 --> 03:17:35.76
Next day I'm just running after this elk.

3188
03:17:35.76 --> 03:17:39.76
And I heard my dad as I was running he says I'm going to shoot him again.

3189
03:17:39.76 --> 03:17:42.76
My dad no no no give me he'll fall he'll fall.

3190
03:17:42.76 --> 03:17:45.76
And when I got there the elk fell.

3191
03:17:45.76 --> 03:17:48.76
And I looked at him and the elk goes.

3192
03:17:48.76 --> 03:17:55.76
And I felt the spirit you know it was like.

3193
03:17:55.76 --> 03:17:58.76
And I saw him die you know.

3194
03:17:58.76 --> 03:18:02.76
And I hadn't done anything since Vietnam right.

3195
03:18:02.76 --> 03:18:06.76
And you know like sometimes when you see those guys and they're gone.

3196
03:18:06.76 --> 03:18:09.76
When you know the spirit was there but they're gone.

3197
03:18:09.76 --> 03:18:12.76
It was like that again.

3198
03:18:12.76 --> 03:18:13.76
Those aren't flashbacks.

3199
03:18:13.76 --> 03:18:15.76
People go oh they got a flashback to Vietnam.

3200
03:18:15.76 --> 03:18:17.76
Those are your stimulations.

3201
03:18:17.76 --> 03:18:19.76
You know where you know where you're at.

3202
03:18:19.76 --> 03:18:20.76
You have a choice to do whatever.

3203
03:18:20.76 --> 03:18:22.76
A lot of guys bullshit themselves out.

3204
03:18:22.76 --> 03:18:24.76
They quit on themselves.

3205
03:18:24.76 --> 03:18:26.76
They give themselves an out of being responsible for themselves.

3206
03:18:26.76 --> 03:18:28.76
That's how I think right.

3207
03:18:28.76 --> 03:18:35.76
And so I looked and I'm standing there and my dad comes up behind me.

3208
03:18:35.76 --> 03:18:39.76
And I had my H harness with my K bar and stuff.

3209
03:18:39.76 --> 03:18:43.76
He says you okay and I turned around and looked at my dad he goes.

3210
03:18:43.76 --> 03:18:45.76
He says you're not okay.

3211
03:18:45.76 --> 03:18:47.76
He gives me your knife.

3212
03:18:47.76 --> 03:18:48.76
He says go get the truck.

3213
03:18:48.76 --> 03:18:53.76
The little bag that had the hatchet and the knife and the bone saw and all the stuff.

3214
03:18:53.76 --> 03:18:56.76
He's like so I go to the truck.

3215
03:18:56.76 --> 03:19:00.76
I get to the truck and I'm like shinking like this.

3216
03:19:00.76 --> 03:19:05.76
He goes oh man god you know wait what am I doing here.

3217
03:19:05.76 --> 03:19:07.76
Why did I even.

3218
03:19:07.76 --> 03:19:11.76
So we grab my get the truck.

3219
03:19:11.76 --> 03:19:12.76
I come back over to him.

3220
03:19:12.76 --> 03:19:15.76
He looks at me.

3221
03:19:15.76 --> 03:19:17.76
He gives me a hug.

3222
03:19:17.76 --> 03:19:18.76
He got me like this.

3223
03:19:18.76 --> 03:19:20.76
With the knife with the blood.

3224
03:19:20.76 --> 03:19:23.76
I'm like this going shit.

3225
03:19:23.76 --> 03:19:25.76
So he says looks at me.

3226
03:19:25.76 --> 03:19:29.76
He says forget that Vietnam bullshit.

3227
03:19:29.76 --> 03:19:31.76
So I need you to help me right now.

3228
03:19:31.76 --> 03:19:33.76
Hold the legs.

3229
03:19:33.76 --> 03:19:41.76
So I'm holding the legs right where there's place with all the the bizarre in the like a pasture right where they'd cut the.

3230
03:19:41.76 --> 03:19:45.76
The stuff down right the.

3231
03:19:45.76 --> 03:19:48.76
Stubble right.

3232
03:19:48.76 --> 03:19:57.76
Operated up to play the reeds of my Cambodia right and that was a pretty flat place but that's what it looked like and.

3233
03:19:57.76 --> 03:20:05.76
I could hear isn't like whoa but I could hear them in.

3234
03:20:05.76 --> 03:20:08.76
In the heart of my mind right.

3235
03:20:08.76 --> 03:20:12.76
Thinking and shaking.

3236
03:20:12.76 --> 03:20:20.76
And so then we got him up and everything he caught shoots a gun his buddy comes down we load him in the truck we take out getting in the truck.

3237
03:20:20.76 --> 03:20:24.76
And my dad says OK says now we pray.

3238
03:20:24.76 --> 03:20:26.76
Right.

3239
03:20:26.76 --> 03:20:33.76
He keeps the liver to you know and Indian way right so we pray and he grabs my hand.

3240
03:20:33.76 --> 03:20:38.76
Says heavenly father said thank you.

3241
03:20:38.76 --> 03:20:41.76

03:20:41.76 --> 03:20:43.76
And I thank you.

03:20:43.76 --> 03:20:48.76
That you gave this folks life to bring him home to me.

You know.

3245
03:20:50.76 --> 03:20:55.76
Pops man come on you know so then that night.

3246
03:20:55.76 --> 03:21:01.76
I couldn't sleep he was in like a little tear tear drop trailer man it was freezing in there right.

3247
03:21:01.76 --> 03:21:07.76
I said I'm going to get outside so I went outside and I looked up at the sky.

3248
03:21:07.76 --> 03:21:17.76
And up in the sky there's two times I've seen it one when I did a Native American sweat with a guy that was a Vietnam vet that invited me to be part of the American Indian veterans of Colorado.

3249
03:21:17.76 --> 03:21:20.76
His name was Wendell Irving one of the greatest honors of my life.

3250
03:21:20.76 --> 03:21:24.76
That was the beginning of me stepping out of all that.

3251
03:21:24.76 --> 03:21:28.76
The oppression of Vietnam and.

3252
03:21:28.76 --> 03:21:31.76
Losing myself.

3253
03:21:31.76 --> 03:21:34.76
Losing the humanist that I was in and.

3254
03:21:34.76 --> 03:21:38.76
That piece that the young boy being revealed right.

3255
03:21:38.76 --> 03:21:42.76
I looked up and I went oh man God this.

3256
03:21:42.76 --> 03:21:45.76
Is this too much these honey drips are too much.

3257
03:21:45.76 --> 03:21:50.76
And then it again in the spirit the same way those mountains spoke to me and said we'll be your friends forever.

3258
03:21:50.76 --> 03:21:51.76
Right.

3259
03:21:51.76 --> 03:21:57.76
And the way the poem almost says I'm with you and that's the way to Vietnam.

3260
03:21:57.76 --> 03:22:05.76
I heard him say I heard the spirit is like the same way that I gave that elk's life to bring you home to your father.

3261
03:22:05.76 --> 03:22:09.76
I gave my son's life to bring you back home to me.

3262
03:22:09.76 --> 03:22:11.76
It was the beginning of.

3263
03:22:11.76 --> 03:22:13.76
Of the spiritual thing you know.

3264
03:22:13.76 --> 03:22:19.76
And I I you know I'd accepted Christ and all that kind of stuff but.

3265
03:22:19.76 --> 03:22:23.76
It was different because then it was blood again.

3266
03:22:23.76 --> 03:22:26.76
Like the word like a Vietnam blood again.

3267
03:22:26.76 --> 03:22:30.76
This is the blood sacrifice of things changes things.

3268
03:22:30.76 --> 03:22:37.76
If people knew what war was and what the blood was like the people in Ukraine right now they know.

3269
03:22:37.76 --> 03:22:39.76
The Americans don't know.

3270
03:22:39.76 --> 03:22:45.76
I mean they'll kill guys in the in you know the the ghettos or whatever over meaningless stuff.

3271
03:22:45.76 --> 03:22:46.76
Right.

3272
03:22:46.76 --> 03:22:50.76
Because you want you want your car or you.

3273
03:22:50.76 --> 03:22:53.76
Or you want his whale tail right.

3274
03:22:53.76 --> 03:22:57.76
Right now I'm in I am Jonah in the whale right now.

3275
03:22:57.76 --> 03:23:01.76
Because I'm trying to sort things out and where am I going with this.

3276
03:23:01.76 --> 03:23:05.76
75 years where am I going for the next 25 years right.

3277
03:23:05.76 --> 03:23:11.76
Where am I going this is part of that challenge this is part of it and where does that come from that comes from being a frog man.

3278
03:23:11.76 --> 03:23:14.76
That comes from not being afraid of being cold.

3279
03:23:14.76 --> 03:23:16.76
I hate it.

3280
03:23:16.76 --> 03:23:21.76
I hate it more than anything but I'm not afraid of it.

3281
03:23:21.76 --> 03:23:25.76
Right.

3282
03:23:25.76 --> 03:23:33.76
I'm not you know it's people so I'm not afraid to die either you know you're not going to know until somebody is there to kill you.

3283
03:23:33.76 --> 03:23:37.76
I mean that's the reality of it.

3284
03:23:37.76 --> 03:23:41.76
I'm I look out there and see all the MMA guys man.

3285
03:23:41.76 --> 03:23:43.76
They're going to go out there.

3286
03:23:43.76 --> 03:23:47.76
The one thing that I admire about all of them is going out there.

3287
03:23:47.76 --> 03:23:52.76
They're the ones going to know not the cats sitting around outside that aren't in the arena.

3288
03:23:52.76 --> 03:23:59.76
They're the only in there getting their ass kicked and then even even though they are which is the one that has enough that's going to pull them out.

3289
03:23:59.76 --> 03:24:02.76
That isn't going to be ego that pulls them out.

3290
03:24:02.76 --> 03:24:04.76
It's going to be their heart to pull some out.

3291
03:24:04.76 --> 03:24:06.76
Those are the two champions.

3292
03:24:06.76 --> 03:24:08.76
There's a guy with all the talent in the world.

3293
03:24:08.76 --> 03:24:13.76
He can kick shit out everybody but but if his heart's not right man it's on ego.

3294
03:24:13.76 --> 03:24:15.76
He's an angry person.

3295
03:24:15.76 --> 03:24:18.76
And I was that angry guy one time.

3296
03:24:18.76 --> 03:24:23.76
I said they're looking in the mirror and going you know the face of death was mine.

3297
03:24:23.76 --> 03:24:26.76
Like what and then I'm going to have kids.

3298
03:24:26.76 --> 03:24:30.76
I can see I can see some of the guy was with the three in the young seal man.

3299
03:24:30.76 --> 03:24:34.76
What do I do? How can I do this and still love my babies little kids.

3300
03:24:34.76 --> 03:24:37.76
I said Barry Enoch did.

3301
03:24:37.76 --> 03:24:42.76
He was sitting there and hold my babies and Barry Enoch is one of the baddest dudes in the valley and one of the nicest guy.

3302
03:24:42.76 --> 03:24:45.76
You ever meet him? Barry Enoch?

3303
03:24:45.76 --> 03:24:48.76
He's a true mentor of teams.

3304
03:24:48.76 --> 03:24:56.76
He was with crawdad you know and it's bigger.

3305
03:24:56.76 --> 03:25:02.76
So my pops gave that to me.

3306
03:25:02.76 --> 03:25:04.76
Fourth grade.

3307
03:25:04.76 --> 03:25:10.76
Then he when I was wrestling in high school.

3308
03:25:10.76 --> 03:25:13.76
He never my sophomore he didn't go see me.

3309
03:25:13.76 --> 03:25:16.76
And then one day I was dry.

3310
03:25:16.76 --> 03:25:18.76
Told him I need to go to a wrestling camp.

3311
03:25:18.76 --> 03:25:19.76
I got lift weights and this and that.

3312
03:25:19.76 --> 03:25:20.76
He's some protein.

3313
03:25:20.76 --> 03:25:22.76
My coach wanted me to do that stuff.

3314
03:25:22.76 --> 03:25:24.76
My dad said well I don't know about that.

3315
03:25:24.76 --> 03:25:26.76
He says I got you a job.

3316
03:25:26.76 --> 03:25:31.76
He says and if you make enough money he says you can go to your wrestling camp.

3317
03:25:31.76 --> 03:25:36.76
He says you know shut up and eat your beans right protein.

3318
03:25:36.76 --> 03:25:38.76
I went I said what's my job?

3319
03:25:38.76 --> 03:25:40.76
He says hang in drywall.

3320
03:25:40.76 --> 03:25:43.76
So I was 98 pounds man hanging drywall with grown men.

3321
03:25:43.76 --> 03:25:46.76
I had to get on a scaffold.

3322
03:25:46.76 --> 03:25:49.76
I mean on a horse to get on a horse to hold that up.

3323
03:25:49.76 --> 03:25:52.76
But there was nobody I ever wrestled that was stronger than me.

3324
03:25:52.76 --> 03:26:00.76
And so all of that prepared me for the teams when I should hang it on the bottom ring of a helicopter in the air.

3325
03:26:00.76 --> 03:26:07.76
And on 500 feet going through training right through budge training we did the drop out of the helicopter and pick up.

3326
03:26:07.76 --> 03:26:12.76
Hanging on and no big no big deal you know.

3327
03:26:12.76 --> 03:26:17.76
That how do you get there right.

3328
03:26:17.76 --> 03:26:26.76
It's each of those little life life things and are knowing that Chief Allen's on my ass you know.

3329
03:26:26.76 --> 03:26:28.76
I was doing drop pick up with him right.

3330
03:26:28.76 --> 03:26:31.76
They were telling you about what that is and I'm sitting there going you ever do drop and pick up.

3331
03:26:31.76 --> 03:26:33.76
They don't do it anymore but I do.

3332
03:26:33.76 --> 03:26:37.76
Yeah well there was one East Coast guy just told me how do you do that stuff just sitting there just jerking you out.

3333
03:26:37.76 --> 03:26:39.76
I said well you got to be swimming backwards.

3334
03:26:39.76 --> 03:26:40.76
He said oh really.

3335
03:26:40.76 --> 03:26:43.76
And they were teaching him to do that you know just kick and go.

3336
03:26:43.76 --> 03:26:48.76
So he says yeah he says it's going to look like the boats going to hit you but don't stay there and he'll pull you in.

3337
03:26:48.76 --> 03:26:50.76
So I'm like this.

3338
03:26:50.76 --> 03:26:52.76
Oh bullshit you know.

3339
03:26:52.76 --> 03:26:55.76
I stroked out and the boat goes by.

3340
03:26:55.76 --> 03:26:57.76
Chief Allen comes back and he's like Brown.

3341
03:26:57.76 --> 03:26:59.76
He says Espinoza don't move.

3342
03:26:59.76 --> 03:27:00.76
Who you Chief Allen.

3343
03:27:00.76 --> 03:27:01.76
He takes off.

3344
03:27:01.76 --> 03:27:03.76
Comes back.

3345
03:27:03.76 --> 03:27:05.76
I swear he's going to hit me again.

3346
03:27:05.76 --> 03:27:11.76
So then the third time he didn't see and he just turns around and comes over and he's coming at me.

3347
03:27:11.76 --> 03:27:13.76
It is really coming.

3348
03:27:13.76 --> 03:27:16.76
I'm kick stroking and glad he ran over me with that boat.

3349
03:27:16.76 --> 03:27:17.76
Boom man.

3350
03:27:17.76 --> 03:27:19.76
My face piece was hanging down and stuff.

3351
03:27:19.76 --> 03:27:22.76
And then he pulls by it.

3352
03:27:22.76 --> 03:27:24.76
Last time.

3353
03:27:24.76 --> 03:27:27.76
He grabbed me when that boat grabbed me and I hooked hooked up.

3354
03:27:27.76 --> 03:27:30.76
He threw me all the guys ducked.

3355
03:27:30.76 --> 03:27:34.76
And I was like as I fly from the boats about this big.

3356
03:27:34.76 --> 03:27:38.76
Everybody's duck and I'm flying through the air and I caught the other side.

3357
03:27:38.76 --> 03:27:45.76
I never ever missed a pickup again.

3358
03:27:45.76 --> 03:27:47.76
So what did you do when you graduated from college?

3359
03:27:47.76 --> 03:27:49.76
Then you wrestled all your years of college?

3360
03:27:49.76 --> 03:27:51.76
Yeah I wrestled four years of college.

3361
03:27:51.76 --> 03:27:58.76
Qualified for the Nationals two times and then it was like Brad Leach was a sheriff.

3362
03:27:58.76 --> 03:28:00.76
And what am I going to do?

3363
03:28:00.76 --> 03:28:02.76
I was going to teach school.

3364
03:28:02.76 --> 03:28:04.76
I was doing my professional year teaching school.

3365
03:28:04.76 --> 03:28:08.76
And this kid comes up and I was with my mentor, my proctor.

3366
03:28:08.76 --> 03:28:12.76
And he says, you see this kid walks out of the classroom.

3367
03:28:12.76 --> 03:28:15.76
He says, hey get back in class.

3368
03:28:15.76 --> 03:28:17.76
The kid looks and says fuck you.

3369
03:28:17.76 --> 03:28:19.76
I'm like what?

3370
03:28:19.76 --> 03:28:22.76
He walks out and I said hey what's the deal with that?

3371
03:28:22.76 --> 03:28:24.76
He said no man.

3372
03:28:24.76 --> 03:28:28.76
I said you can't grab his head stuck in the locker.

3373
03:28:28.76 --> 03:28:30.76
He said no you can't do that.

3374
03:28:30.76 --> 03:28:32.76
They'll arrest you.

3375
03:28:32.76 --> 03:28:34.76
I said well I'm not going to be a teacher.

3376
03:28:34.76 --> 03:28:37.76
And I graduated and I was what am I going to do?

3377
03:28:37.76 --> 03:28:40.76
I didn't want to teach school so Brad Leach was a sheriff.

3378
03:28:40.76 --> 03:28:43.76
And he says how would you like to come on to the police department?

3379
03:28:43.76 --> 03:28:47.76
He says then we'll start a dive rescue team since you're in the teams.

3380
03:28:47.76 --> 03:28:50.76
You can shoot and stuff and do that.

3381
03:28:50.76 --> 03:28:54.76
So I was like come down and do the polygraph and gave me the whole test.

3382
03:28:54.76 --> 03:28:56.76
I did everything.

3383
03:28:56.76 --> 03:28:58.76
Polygraph the drug thing I was just from CU right?

3384
03:28:58.76 --> 03:29:00.76
He says you ever done any drugs?

3385
03:29:00.76 --> 03:29:02.76
I'm going what do you mean?

3386
03:29:02.76 --> 03:29:04.76
He says well I'm going to clarify.

3387
03:29:04.76 --> 03:29:10.76
They gave me those pills in Vietnam that speed and they kept us awake all night.

3388
03:29:10.76 --> 03:29:14.76
That was the only thing I'd ever done and maybe down in Mexico a little bit white pills.

3389
03:29:14.76 --> 03:29:17.76
Just a party for the weekend.

3390
03:29:17.76 --> 03:29:21.76
So I thought okay smoking grass I did.

3391
03:29:21.76 --> 03:29:23.76
So how do you justify it?

3392
03:29:23.76 --> 03:29:28.76
Well if you take a lid like this and you smoke it and you share it with people you actually only smoke about that much.

3393
03:29:28.76 --> 03:29:30.76
Maybe a quarter of a lid.

3394
03:29:30.76 --> 03:29:33.76
Other than that did you do any more drugs?

3395
03:29:33.76 --> 03:29:35.76
I said oh no.

3396
03:29:35.76 --> 03:29:37.76
Okay I passed that.

3397
03:29:37.76 --> 03:29:39.76
So then Brad Leach says oh yeah he says you're good.

3398
03:29:39.76 --> 03:29:42.76
He says come on we'll get you to the academy and give you a gun.

3399
03:29:42.76 --> 03:29:44.76
This is for sheriff.

3400
03:29:44.76 --> 03:29:47.76
And I went I said okay so I go home Sunday.

3401
03:29:47.76 --> 03:29:48.76
Go to sleep.

3402
03:29:48.76 --> 03:29:52.76
Wake up and it was like wait a minute.

3403
03:29:52.76 --> 03:29:54.76
Ain't no way I could be a cop.

3404
03:29:54.76 --> 03:29:58.76
If I can't take crap from a 13 year old kid I'm going to kill you.

3405
03:29:58.76 --> 03:30:02.76
I mean I'd fight guys at the bar right?

3406
03:30:02.76 --> 03:30:08.76
But if I'm going to be stalked by somebody and you're going to pull a gun on me I'm going to kill you.

3407
03:30:08.76 --> 03:30:10.76
So I thought I can't do that either.

3408
03:30:10.76 --> 03:30:12.76
So then the fire department came up.

3409
03:30:12.76 --> 03:30:14.76
So it couldn't be a cop.

3410
03:30:14.76 --> 03:30:16.76
It couldn't be a teacher.

3411
03:30:16.76 --> 03:30:20.76
There was a movie called Kung Fu.

3412
03:30:20.76 --> 03:30:22.76
And it was grasshopper stuff.

3413
03:30:22.76 --> 03:30:27.76
It's kind of like everybody in Boulder was kind of like oh the essence of life.

3414
03:30:27.76 --> 03:30:33.76
Shoot I went on all kinds of lines I could pick up on chicks and talk to people and go into school.

3415
03:30:33.76 --> 03:30:36.76
So I was like what am I going to do?

3416
03:30:36.76 --> 03:30:43.76
And so then they were having affirmative action hiring for people of color right?

3417
03:30:43.76 --> 03:30:47.76
200 people are going to hire one guy on the fire department.

3418
03:30:47.76 --> 03:30:48.76
I didn't know about it.

3419
03:30:48.76 --> 03:30:54.76
Miss Martinez who my mom was going to kick the shit out of calling me father right?

3420
03:30:54.76 --> 03:30:56.76
She calls him and says hey they're hiring firefighters in Boulder.

3421
03:30:56.76 --> 03:30:57.76
They're going to hire one.

3422
03:30:57.76 --> 03:30:59.76
She said why don't you try it?

3423
03:30:59.76 --> 03:31:04.76
So I'm like see, air, land and fire.

3424
03:31:04.76 --> 03:31:06.76
Four elements of life.

3425
03:31:06.76 --> 03:31:07.76
Just like directions.

3426
03:31:07.76 --> 03:31:09.76
North, south, east and west.

3427
03:31:09.76 --> 03:31:13.76
I mean it was all coming together and I was really getting sensitized to this.

3428
03:31:13.76 --> 03:31:14.76
I almost became a Buddhist.

3429
03:31:14.76 --> 03:31:16.76
I was thinking about all that stuff.

3430
03:31:16.76 --> 03:31:18.76
So I said yeah okay I'll try it.

3431
03:31:18.76 --> 03:31:21.76
And I was wrestling at CU right?

3432
03:31:21.76 --> 03:31:23.76
I was running 15 miles.

3433
03:31:23.76 --> 03:31:25.76
I was in good shape.

3434
03:31:25.76 --> 03:31:31.76
And at that time it was push-ups, sit-ups, chin-ups and all that other kind of stuff.

3435
03:31:31.76 --> 03:31:33.76
So I kicked everybody's butt on that.

3436
03:31:33.76 --> 03:31:36.76
I had an afro, my mustache.

3437
03:31:36.76 --> 03:31:40.76
You know because I had a, you know you got a little cool up there at CU.

3438
03:31:40.76 --> 03:31:43.76
You know it's the whole hippie looking thing right?

3439
03:31:43.76 --> 03:31:50.76
And so I do the interview and stuff and they're like oh yeah you really, there's a seal team.

3440
03:31:50.76 --> 03:31:51.76
What was that?

3441
03:31:51.76 --> 03:31:53.76
I said well not really much.

3442
03:31:53.76 --> 03:31:59.76
I said you know I got to wear shades, wear swimming trunks and just kind of hung out on the beach and stuff.

3443
03:31:59.76 --> 03:32:03.76
It was red boats, oh okay.

3444
03:32:03.76 --> 03:32:04.76
So that's the Navy.

3445
03:32:04.76 --> 03:32:05.76
I said yeah.

3446
03:32:05.76 --> 03:32:07.76
I didn't tell them what the teams, they didn't even know what the teams were.

3447
03:32:07.76 --> 03:32:13.76
You know I did have a jacket, had UDT on it because seal team didn't have a, but I had a UDT patch right?

3448
03:32:13.76 --> 03:32:16.76
In my fire now it's all gone but.

3449
03:32:16.76 --> 03:32:20.76
And when I hitchhiked home from the Navy.

3450
03:32:20.76 --> 03:32:23.76
When I got out?

3451
03:32:23.76 --> 03:32:26.76
When I got out nobody picked me up because I want to know what I fought for.

3452
03:32:26.76 --> 03:32:29.76
Two old ladies picked me up in New Mexico.

3453
03:32:29.76 --> 03:32:30.76
These other Mexican guys picked me up.

3454
03:32:30.76 --> 03:32:31.76
No wonder they frisked me.

3455
03:32:31.76 --> 03:32:34.76
I had my 38 in the back.

3456
03:32:34.76 --> 03:32:36.76
They frisked me but I was sitting in the back.

3457
03:32:36.76 --> 03:32:40.76
I think I ought to pull this thing out and say okay guys everybody out of the, but I didn't.

3458
03:32:40.76 --> 03:32:45.76
Then when I got to, we were in the Colorado some coyotes were, were stalking me.

3459
03:32:45.76 --> 03:32:49.76
I think I'm going to come back in Vietnam and get eaten by the damn coyotes.

3460
03:32:49.76 --> 03:32:52.76
Then the guy in a tractor trailer truck tried to run over me.

3461
03:32:52.76 --> 03:32:53.76
He thought I was a cow.

3462
03:32:53.76 --> 03:32:56.76
He stopped and gave me a ride into Colorado.

3463
03:32:56.76 --> 03:32:59.76
That's how I got home from the Navy.

3464
03:32:59.76 --> 03:33:02.76
So I said yeah, I'll do this.

3465
03:33:02.76 --> 03:33:04.76
Took the interviews and everything.

3466
03:33:04.76 --> 03:33:07.76
He said well yeah, but you got that stuff there boy.

3467
03:33:07.76 --> 03:33:12.76
All white haired guys, blue eyed from Nebraska.

3468
03:33:12.76 --> 03:33:18.76
I said well I'll just try it.

3469
03:33:18.76 --> 03:33:20.76
I said well he shaves off.

3470
03:33:20.76 --> 03:33:23.76
I mean my hair's been cut shorter. I can shave my mustache.

3471
03:33:23.76 --> 03:33:25.76
I'm not, okay.

3472
03:33:25.76 --> 03:33:28.76
So I show up.

3473
03:33:28.76 --> 03:33:33.76
I was drinking, you know, I was still, I was still over here.

3474
03:33:33.76 --> 03:33:38.76
I was going, I didn't know I was going through post-traumatic stress.

3475
03:33:38.76 --> 03:33:42.76
When you look at the behaviors now I know I was, but um.

3476
03:33:42.76 --> 03:33:44.76
And the behaviors are drinking, fighting.

3477
03:33:44.76 --> 03:33:45.76
All of that stuff.

3478
03:33:45.76 --> 03:33:46.76
Just the whole night.

3479
03:33:46.76 --> 03:33:49.76
Racism, sexism, you know, screw the white guys and whatever.

3480
03:33:49.76 --> 03:33:53.76
So I'm telling you about, you know, you finalize yourself as a frogman

3481
03:33:53.76 --> 03:33:56.76
and you're pretty clean about who you are, right?

3482
03:33:56.76 --> 03:33:59.76
But then when you don't fit, you don't feel that you don't fit,

3483
03:33:59.76 --> 03:34:02.76
then you start bringing all this stuff back, right?

3484
03:34:02.76 --> 03:34:06.76
That's the socialization piece because that's easy to fall back into, right?

3485
03:34:06.76 --> 03:34:09.76
So I got out of the fire department.

3486
03:34:09.76 --> 03:34:15.76
I was like, this guy says, yeah kid, you know where you belong?

3487
03:34:15.76 --> 03:34:18.76
He says we're going to get along fine on this department, right?

3488
03:34:18.76 --> 03:34:25.76
So I put up with that for about, well, five months later, I was drinking

3489
03:34:25.76 --> 03:34:27.76
and I was, it was already the beginning.

3490
03:34:27.76 --> 03:34:32.76
I, I had lacerated my liver, three holes in my duodenum.

3491
03:34:32.76 --> 03:34:34.76
I got this, this cut here.

3492
03:34:34.76 --> 03:34:38.76
I have one down my leg lacerated my liver, right in the motorcycle,

3493
03:34:38.76 --> 03:34:42.76
drinking and going back over to Denver.

3494
03:34:42.76 --> 03:34:45.76
The one thing cool about those guys was they covered for me because I had

3495
03:34:45.76 --> 03:34:47.76
no sick or vacation.

3496
03:34:47.76 --> 03:34:50.76
We worked every other day for three days and we were off four days.

3497
03:34:50.76 --> 03:34:53.76
So if you'd have 10 days off, you had to offer a month.

3498
03:34:53.76 --> 03:34:59.76
So 20 guys, 20 shifts were covered for me and I paid those shifts back when I got back to work,

3499
03:34:59.76 --> 03:35:01.76
but I kept my job.

3500
03:35:01.76 --> 03:35:04.76
So I'm going, well, it's pretty cool.

3501
03:35:04.76 --> 03:35:09.76
Waking up at seven o'clock in the morning, the same thing as waking up at seven at night if you're drunk.

3502
03:35:09.76 --> 03:35:12.76
And every other day thing is got to call up, oh, shut up, I'm sick.

3503
03:35:12.76 --> 03:35:14.76
Hey, you know, I'm calling in sick.

3504
03:35:14.76 --> 03:35:15.76
They go, well, you're on a four day.

3505
03:35:15.76 --> 03:35:17.76
You don't come back.

3506
03:35:17.76 --> 03:35:18.76
I said, when do I go back?

3507
03:35:18.76 --> 03:35:19.76
Three more days.

3508
03:35:19.76 --> 03:35:22.76
Oh, so I'd use all my sick, my vacation.

3509
03:35:22.76 --> 03:35:24.76
There's times I wasn't coming to work.

3510
03:35:24.76 --> 03:35:28.76
I mean, it was, it was hard because it was so free.

3511
03:35:28.76 --> 03:35:33.76
I didn't have structure and even when I was wrestling in college, my wrestling coach,

3512
03:35:33.76 --> 03:35:36.76
I wanted to go back to the, I want to go back to war.

3513
03:35:36.76 --> 03:35:37.76
I'd be drunk.

3514
03:35:37.76 --> 03:35:41.76
I smoke him a cigarette in the bar and say, hey, man, I just want to let you know I want to leave.

3515
03:35:41.76 --> 03:35:44.76
Shelby Wilson, Olympic champion.

3516
03:35:44.76 --> 03:35:49.76
He said, well, girls, if you want to quit, I'll tell the team you can go.

3517
03:35:49.76 --> 03:35:53.76
Son of a gun.

3518
03:35:53.76 --> 03:35:54.76
So I didn't quit.

3519
03:35:54.76 --> 03:35:59.76
I struggled the last, you know, they struggled, you know, standing in college because of that

3520
03:35:59.76 --> 03:36:00.76
quit thing.

3521
03:36:00.76 --> 03:36:06.76
I couldn't let them, I couldn't let myself down to let them down because I never quit

3522
03:36:06.76 --> 03:36:08.76
anything in my life.

3523
03:36:08.76 --> 03:36:10.76
Right.

3524
03:36:10.76 --> 03:36:12.76
So.

3525
03:36:12.76 --> 03:36:20.76
So how long did it take like at, as a firefighter, at what point did you start to kind of figure

3526
03:36:20.76 --> 03:36:25.76
out that maybe all this drinking wasn't so good for you, maybe that you were, uh, had

3527
03:36:25.76 --> 03:36:28.76
some stuff you needed to sort out?

3528
03:36:28.76 --> 03:36:32.76
Well, finally, if I, who I was, right, I'm on, I'm on the first fire call.

3529
03:36:32.76 --> 03:36:35.76
I go out, but I'm a cup of coffee down.

3530
03:36:35.76 --> 03:36:36.76
We go out of going to call them.

3531
03:36:36.76 --> 03:36:41.76
There's this guy trapped like this in a vehicle or in a building in a vehicle.

3532
03:36:41.76 --> 03:36:42.76
Car wreck.

3533
03:36:42.76 --> 03:36:45.76
So I'm looking at him and I'm like, what do I do?

3534
03:36:45.76 --> 03:36:47.76
He says, here it's hold the whole skin.

3535
03:36:47.76 --> 03:36:48.76
So we're doing an education.

3536
03:36:48.76 --> 03:36:49.76
We'll tell you what to do.

3537
03:36:49.76 --> 03:36:51.76
Car catches on fire, open up.

3538
03:36:51.76 --> 03:36:53.76
I'm like, all right.

3539
03:36:53.76 --> 03:36:58.76
So I'm sitting there watching this guy and they're trying to get him cut open and stuff.

3540
03:36:58.76 --> 03:37:00.76
And I remember it had that.

3541
03:37:00.76 --> 03:37:02.76
I'm not going to drink anymore.

3542
03:37:02.76 --> 03:37:04.76
Uh, I'd had that.

3543
03:37:04.76 --> 03:37:06.76
I think it's a diuretic.

3544
03:37:06.76 --> 03:37:11.76
So anyway, I took a cup of coffee, right?

3545
03:37:11.76 --> 03:37:14.76
First cup of coffee, man, sit there and boom, get a call.

3546
03:37:14.76 --> 03:37:15.76
I put it down.

3547
03:37:15.76 --> 03:37:16.76
We take off.

3548
03:37:16.76 --> 03:37:23.76
I'm sitting there watching this guy and all I could think of when I was watching him was,

3549
03:37:23.76 --> 03:37:25.76
look, man, why don't you just hurry up and fucking die?

3550
03:37:25.76 --> 03:37:27.76
Cause I know you're going to die.

3551
03:37:27.76 --> 03:37:28.76
My coffee's getting cold.

3552
03:37:28.76 --> 03:37:31.76
You know, that's where I was.

3553
03:37:31.76 --> 03:37:33.76
So they cut him apart and he died.

3554
03:37:33.76 --> 03:37:34.76
Right.

3555
03:37:34.76 --> 03:37:38.76
I go back, I grab my cup of coffee, take a sip and I went, it's cold.

3556
03:37:38.76 --> 03:37:44.76
And I went, okay, what's happening?

3557
03:37:44.76 --> 03:37:46.76
What, what's happened to me?

3558
03:37:46.76 --> 03:37:49.76
When my dad told me, he says, don't forget that you're a human being.

3559
03:37:49.76 --> 03:37:50.76
Right.

3560
03:37:50.76 --> 03:37:53.76
And I saw this go down and I had no feelings.

3561
03:37:53.76 --> 03:38:02.76
Nothing is like getting disconnected over over in Vietnam, getting disconnected.

3562
03:38:02.76 --> 03:38:10.76
This space and time and not discharging, you know, cause when you're there, I wasn't

3563
03:38:10.76 --> 03:38:11.76
discharging anymore.

3564
03:38:11.76 --> 03:38:12.76
I wasn't crying.

3565
03:38:12.76 --> 03:38:13.76
I wasn't laughing.

3566
03:38:13.76 --> 03:38:14.76
It wasn't mean even now.

3567
03:38:14.76 --> 03:38:18.76
Sometimes some kids just say, well, Mr. Espinoles really doesn't have a sense of humor.

3568
03:38:18.76 --> 03:38:22.26
Cause sometimes I don't, you know, even on the fire department, I'd look at somebody and

3569
03:38:22.26 --> 03:38:24.76
they'd say, I think this guy's trying to kill me.

3570
03:38:24.76 --> 03:38:28.76
You know, but so it was like, okay, that was the thinking about it.

3571
03:38:28.76 --> 03:38:33.76
And I, I became very best friends with this guy named Billy Durand.

3572
03:38:33.76 --> 03:38:35.76
He was an Air Force guy, right?

3573
03:38:35.76 --> 03:38:37.76
He's a firefighter.

3574
03:38:37.76 --> 03:38:43.76
So as I got on the fire department, they told me, you remember where you belong and this

3575
03:38:43.76 --> 03:38:44.76
and all that kind of stuff.

3576
03:38:44.76 --> 03:38:49.76
And then about the fifth year, I mean, four years, because it was easy.

3577
03:38:49.76 --> 03:38:51.76
I was drinking.

3578
03:38:51.76 --> 03:38:52.76
I was getting paid good money.

3579
03:38:52.76 --> 03:38:55.76
I spent most of my money on a bar tap.

3580
03:38:55.76 --> 03:38:56.76
I'd buy in for everybody.

3581
03:38:56.76 --> 03:38:57.76
You know, I went to the bar.

3582
03:38:57.76 --> 03:39:00.76
You know, I wasn't even taking vacations.

3583
03:39:00.76 --> 03:39:04.76
I was just using my time and drinking and fighting and whatever.

3584
03:39:04.76 --> 03:39:08.76
And I was not happy.

3585
03:39:08.76 --> 03:39:19.76
It's kind of like, um, what am I doing here?

3586
03:39:19.76 --> 03:39:21.76
So then there was a training fire.

3587
03:39:21.76 --> 03:39:22.76
I was the second guy.

3588
03:39:22.76 --> 03:39:25.76
I was, I was, I was the third engine to go in and do this training fire.

3589
03:39:25.76 --> 03:39:30.76
So as a training fire, is that they set a building on fire that's going to be demoed

3590
03:39:30.76 --> 03:39:31.76
or something like that.

3591
03:39:31.76 --> 03:39:34.76
So there's taking advantage of a building that's going to be demoed.

3592
03:39:34.76 --> 03:39:36.76
What they were doing is they were doing smoke training.

3593
03:39:36.76 --> 03:39:38.76
And in the smoke training, there was a new lieutenant.

3594
03:39:38.76 --> 03:39:44.76
So this older lieutenant was trying to train the see how it kind of macho man.

3595
03:39:44.76 --> 03:39:48.76
He was, he was, he could really fight fire and what kind of smoke usually was.

3596
03:39:48.76 --> 03:39:53.76
I was at another station, Billy Durand and this other young kid had one month on the job.

3597
03:39:53.76 --> 03:39:56.76
Well, if you burn tires, it's a hydrocarbon.

3598
03:39:56.76 --> 03:39:59.76
The temperatures in this chicken coop over the period of time,

3599
03:39:59.76 --> 03:40:02.76
so there was three or four other evolutions that happened in that same building.

3600
03:40:02.76 --> 03:40:04.76
It lowered the flash point, right?

3601
03:40:04.76 --> 03:40:12.76
So at one point it ignited, killed Builder and killed the other kid, the lieutenant that was in charge.

3602
03:40:12.76 --> 03:40:13.76
He suffered some burns.

3603
03:40:13.76 --> 03:40:18.76
The lieutenant that was in charge of the engine company, 80% burns on his body.

3604
03:40:18.76 --> 03:40:19.76
So he died.

3605
03:40:19.76 --> 03:40:23.76
You know, he got burned up and the Billy died.

3606
03:40:23.76 --> 03:40:27.76
And for me, it was kind of like there was, there was something was going on too,

3607
03:40:27.76 --> 03:40:34.76
because I was pretty violent and previous, you know, when, when that happened,

3608
03:40:34.76 --> 03:40:39.76
I got fed up with everything, right?

3609
03:40:39.76 --> 03:40:47.76
And so one day, no, I know I felt about not having any feelings.

3610
03:40:47.76 --> 03:40:52.76
Billy Durand getting killed, all this petty ass bullshit was like,

3611
03:40:52.76 --> 03:40:56.76
for instance, a black guy was walking with a girl, right?

3612
03:40:56.76 --> 03:40:58.76
And I'm sitting there and they go, look at that.

3613
03:40:58.76 --> 03:40:59.76
I said, look at what?

3614
03:40:59.76 --> 03:41:02.76
It's that black guy with that woman, white woman.

3615
03:41:02.76 --> 03:41:04.76
What do you think about that?

3616
03:41:04.76 --> 03:41:07.76
I said, what I think about it is who's me walking out there for that woman.

3617
03:41:07.76 --> 03:41:10.76
You'd be on the inside looking at me and saying, look at that guy.

3618
03:41:10.76 --> 03:41:11.76
What's he doing with that white woman?

3619
03:41:11.76 --> 03:41:14.76
You know, that's what I think about it.

3620
03:41:14.76 --> 03:41:16.76
You know, it doesn't mean nothing to me.

3621
03:41:16.76 --> 03:41:19.76
And so then it was, so then I got fed up with that.

3622
03:41:19.76 --> 03:41:20.76
So I was in a dive locker, right?

3623
03:41:20.76 --> 03:41:27.76
Because I'm doing diving, kind of trying to reorganize the dive team at my level.

3624
03:41:27.76 --> 03:41:31.76
And one guy was talking about, he had a little booby trap cleaning up, petty ass bullshit,

3625
03:41:31.76 --> 03:41:33.76
you know, kind of like cleaning up.

3626
03:41:33.76 --> 03:41:39.76
He was an officer, set me up that I didn't clean up the space in on the engineer's room.

3627
03:41:39.76 --> 03:41:41.76
So I said went up in the officer's room.

3628
03:41:41.76 --> 03:41:42.76
He didn't clean it up.

3629
03:41:42.76 --> 03:41:44.76
He got on me for not cleaning up mine.

3630
03:41:44.76 --> 03:41:45.76
So I got on him, but not cleaned up his.

3631
03:41:45.76 --> 03:41:47.76
He said, why didn't you just clean it then?

3632
03:41:47.76 --> 03:41:49.76
I said, why didn't you just clean yours?

3633
03:41:49.76 --> 03:41:52.76
As a matter of fact, I grabbed hold of the door, closed it.

3634
03:41:52.76 --> 03:41:54.76
He says, what are you doing?

3635
03:41:54.76 --> 03:41:58.76
I said, I want to tell you what, man, today you kicked the shit out of me or I kicked the shit out of you.

3636
03:41:58.76 --> 03:42:03.76
Because I'm tired of all your white man bullshit and all of this traditional firefighter bullshit.

3637
03:42:03.76 --> 03:42:06.76
He goes, whoa, whoa, wait, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait.

3638
03:42:06.76 --> 03:42:07.76
What do you mean?

3639
03:42:07.76 --> 03:42:08.76
I said, where are you from?

3640
03:42:08.76 --> 03:42:10.76
He said, I'm from Lincoln.

3641
03:42:10.76 --> 03:42:12.76
Yeah, I said, where's your people from?

3642
03:42:12.76 --> 03:42:13.76
Well, we're Germans.

3643
03:42:13.76 --> 03:42:16.76
I said, were you raised here?

3644
03:42:16.76 --> 03:42:17.76
He said, no.

3645
03:42:17.76 --> 03:42:18.76
I said, well, I was raised here.

3646
03:42:18.76 --> 03:42:20.76
My dad, we're from the Peacree's Pueblo.

3647
03:42:20.76 --> 03:42:22.76
So I'm from, I was born in Colorado.

3648
03:42:22.76 --> 03:42:25.76
I said, did you ever kill a commie for mommy?

3649
03:42:25.76 --> 03:42:27.76
He was, what?

3650
03:42:27.76 --> 03:42:29.76
I said, did you ever, you ever in the military?

3651
03:42:29.76 --> 03:42:31.76
Did you ever kill a commie for mommy, man?

3652
03:42:31.76 --> 03:42:34.76
Well, no, you know I'm not.

3653
03:42:34.76 --> 03:42:35.76
I'm not in the military.

3654
03:42:35.76 --> 03:42:40.76
I said, well, they don't give me this shit about where I belong or anything else.

3655
03:42:40.76 --> 03:42:41.76
He said, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute, God.

3656
03:42:41.76 --> 03:42:43.76
I don't know where this is coming from.

3657
03:42:43.76 --> 03:42:44.76
I said, we don't know where it's coming from.

3658
03:42:44.76 --> 03:42:47.76
This is affirmative action bullshit that all you white guys are talking about.

3659
03:42:47.76 --> 03:42:49.76
It says, and I'm not buying into it.

3660
03:42:49.76 --> 03:42:51.76
I'm a frog man.

3661
03:42:51.76 --> 03:42:54.76
He goes, wait, wait, wait a minute.

3662
03:42:54.76 --> 03:43:01.76
He says, you know, on this fire department, if they have fires, they want you with them

3663
03:43:01.76 --> 03:43:03.76
because you're a good firefighter.

3664
03:43:03.76 --> 03:43:06.76
Estrification now, you're good at extrication.

3665
03:43:06.76 --> 03:43:08.76
They want you with them.

3666
03:43:08.76 --> 03:43:14.76
They go into a bar fight, they go into the bars, they want you with them because you know most of the guys anyway in Boulder, right?

3667
03:43:14.76 --> 03:43:21.76
EMS, they know you know EMS and they can count on you on the engines.

3668
03:43:21.76 --> 03:43:27.76
He says, but there's more to being an all around firefighter and you're not doing it.

3669
03:43:27.76 --> 03:43:29.76
I said, what's that?

3670
03:43:29.76 --> 03:43:37.76
He says, coming to work on time, coming to work, not being on suspension and not being hungover.

3671
03:43:37.76 --> 03:43:40.76
Boom, man.

3672
03:43:40.76 --> 03:43:50.76
In my mind, I heard my dad say, Gibi, the only thing I give you is my last name, don't bring dishonor on it.

3673
03:43:50.76 --> 03:43:53.76
And then he says, you know, I said, well, I don't give a shit.

3674
03:43:53.76 --> 03:43:58.76
I said, I'm getting connected to go to Saudi Arabia as a weapons instructor.

3675
03:43:58.76 --> 03:44:02.76
Got connected to, it was called Brown Magazine, Soldier Fortune Magazine.

3676
03:44:02.76 --> 03:44:06.76
I already got accepted and they're going to give me 100,000 for the year.

3677
03:44:06.76 --> 03:44:10.76
But if I got killed, they, my family didn't get it.

3678
03:44:10.76 --> 03:44:15.76
It was totally disconnected, total, you know, and I said, that's what I'm doing.

3679
03:44:15.76 --> 03:44:17.76
So I don't give a shit.

3680
03:44:17.76 --> 03:44:19.76
But then I was going to put my two weeks notice.

3681
03:44:19.76 --> 03:44:23.76
There was a Friday, I was going to put my two weeks notice in and be gone.

3682
03:44:23.76 --> 03:44:33.76
He says, well, when you do that, he says everybody's going to be glad that you're gone because your reputation sucks.

3683
03:44:33.76 --> 03:44:38.76
So I went over to the door, I opened it up, I stepped out and I closed the door and left him in there.

3684
03:44:38.76 --> 03:44:49.76
I went over to the, the, the dorm where the beds were and I laid down and I thought, shit, I can't leave here until my reputation's right.

3685
03:44:49.76 --> 03:44:53.76
So the next day I go to Monday, I go to the chief.

3686
03:44:53.76 --> 03:44:56.76
So I'm going to tell you what, man, this is, I'm going to come to work on time.

3687
03:44:56.76 --> 03:44:57.76
I'm not going to be hungover.

3688
03:44:57.76 --> 03:45:06.76
I'm trying to max out my, my vacation days, my six days and that's why I'm giving you my word as a, as a, as a man.

3689
03:45:06.76 --> 03:45:08.76
My word period, not as a man.

3690
03:45:08.76 --> 03:45:09.76
I'm giving you my word.

3691
03:45:09.76 --> 03:45:11.76
Okay, Gil, that's cool.

3692
03:45:11.76 --> 03:45:12.76
Everything's good.

3693
03:45:12.76 --> 03:45:15.76
And he actually gave me some space.

3694
03:45:15.76 --> 03:45:23.76
One of my battalion chiefs told me, is this Gil and my cousin, Davey, when I beat up a guy real badly and my bad chiefs sit there and he says,

3695
03:45:23.76 --> 03:45:33.76
Gil, I don't know if you need a priest, a psychiatrist, a doctor, a counselor or what, but I don't know how to deal with you.

3696
03:45:33.76 --> 03:45:35.76
I said, well, I'm a man, man.

3697
03:45:35.76 --> 03:45:36.76
I'm what a real man is.

3698
03:45:36.76 --> 03:45:39.76
I don't need anybody and there's nothing wrong with this with me.

3699
03:45:39.76 --> 03:45:42.76
The whole world's jacked up, but I'm not, I'm right.

3700
03:45:42.76 --> 03:45:44.76
Everybody else is, you know.

3701
03:45:44.76 --> 03:45:49.76
So anyway, I made that commitment to him.

3702
03:45:49.76 --> 03:45:52.76
Two shifts later, I'm in a fire.

3703
03:45:52.76 --> 03:45:54.76
I fall in a hole.

3704
03:45:54.76 --> 03:46:04.76
My lieutenant falls over me and tears later on toward my ACL out, but I'd given him my word.

3705
03:46:04.76 --> 03:46:12.76
So I a-strapped my knee for a month and worked like that.

3706
03:46:12.76 --> 03:46:15.76
And so then later on we're doing training fire.

3707
03:46:15.76 --> 03:46:22.76
And I jumped off the apparatus and it caught my leg just right.

3708
03:46:22.76 --> 03:46:23.76
And, ah, man.

3709
03:46:23.76 --> 03:46:30.76
So then I went to the hospital and they said, oh yeah, you tore your meniscus and your ACL has been torn for a long time.

3710
03:46:30.76 --> 03:46:33.76
So then I had to rehab.

3711
03:46:33.76 --> 03:46:41.76
So that was the beginning of me now becoming a firefighter that I can't leave until I get all this stuff straight.

3712
03:46:41.76 --> 03:46:52.76
And so then the part of being revealed again, when I got on that job, when we moved to Boulder, my dad's first job was working at Fire Station 2.

3713
03:46:52.76 --> 03:46:53.76
Shoveling snow.

3714
03:46:53.76 --> 03:46:54.76
He was a laborer.

3715
03:46:54.76 --> 03:46:58.76
So he comes home and I said, how would you do today, dad?

3716
03:46:58.76 --> 03:47:00.76
I was like 10.

3717
03:47:00.76 --> 03:47:02.76
Well, it was after the hunting, right?

3718
03:47:02.76 --> 03:47:03.76
Maybe 11.

3719
03:47:03.76 --> 03:47:04.76
No, I was younger.

3720
03:47:04.76 --> 03:47:06.76
I was like before the hunting thing.

3721
03:47:06.76 --> 03:47:08.76
So I was at the fire department.

3722
03:47:08.76 --> 03:47:09.76
What were you doing?

3723
03:47:09.76 --> 03:47:11.76
So I was working with the fire department.

3724
03:47:11.76 --> 03:47:12.76
What did you do?

3725
03:47:12.76 --> 03:47:14.76
I shoveled snow off the roof.

3726
03:47:14.76 --> 03:47:17.76
I said, oh, what were the firemen doing?

3727
03:47:17.76 --> 03:47:21.76
Oh, they were in there smoking cigarettes, watching TV and drinking coffee.

3728
03:47:21.76 --> 03:47:23.76
He says, I think I could do that job.

3729
03:47:23.76 --> 03:47:26.76
You know, I said, yeah, he says, yes, I could do that job.

3730
03:47:26.76 --> 03:47:27.76
That's cool.

3731
03:47:27.76 --> 03:47:30.76
So I became a firefighter.

3732
03:47:30.76 --> 03:47:34.76
My mom, when I became a firefighter, has a piece of paper.

3733
03:47:34.76 --> 03:47:35.76
It was in a book.

3734
03:47:35.76 --> 03:47:38.76
It's called First Latinos in Boulder County.

3735
03:47:38.76 --> 03:47:40.76
And I have a copy of it.

3736
03:47:40.76 --> 03:47:44.76
And in it is a thing that I wrote when I was in fourth grade or third grade.

3737
03:47:44.76 --> 03:47:46.76
I was a shitty handwriting.

3738
03:47:46.76 --> 03:47:50.76
So when I grow up, I want to be a fireman.

3739
03:47:50.76 --> 03:47:51.76
I might ring the bell.

3740
03:47:51.76 --> 03:47:56.76
I wear the rubber coat, the rubber coat, the boots and the hat.

3741
03:47:56.76 --> 03:47:58.76
And we'll go on a fire truck real fast.

3742
03:47:58.76 --> 03:48:01.76
And I'll ring the bell and I might sleep in the fire station.

3743
03:48:01.76 --> 03:48:03.76
She gave that to me.

3744
03:48:03.76 --> 03:48:06.76
And I went, I didn't even know it, right?

3745
03:48:06.76 --> 03:48:09.76
Oh, my first assignment is station two.

3746
03:48:09.76 --> 03:48:12.76
I walk in with my bunker goats, go out in the stuff.

3747
03:48:12.76 --> 03:48:15.76
The same station that my dad was, right?

3748
03:48:15.76 --> 03:48:17.76
Put your gear up there, kid.

3749
03:48:17.76 --> 03:48:19.76
All right, put my gear up.

3750
03:48:19.76 --> 03:48:22.76
And I walked into the lounge.

3751
03:48:22.76 --> 03:48:26.76
I looked out the windows where I know my dad was looking in.

3752
03:48:26.76 --> 03:48:29.76
And in here, right?

3753
03:48:29.76 --> 03:48:32.76
I love God because God talks to your spirit, you know, those things.

3754
03:48:32.76 --> 03:48:33.76
And it's always a good thing.

3755
03:48:33.76 --> 03:48:37.76
Never ever God telling you, oh, you fucked up or you're bad or whatever it is.

3756
03:48:37.76 --> 03:48:43.76
It's like, hey, now you guys are on the inside.

3757
03:48:43.76 --> 03:48:48.76
Hey, pops, go on the inside now.

3758
03:48:48.76 --> 03:48:49.76
So there I was.

3759
03:48:49.76 --> 03:48:56.76
There was a firefighter in, and I did have a little bit of trouble.

3760
03:48:56.76 --> 03:49:00.76
I was blessed by this guy named JJ that became my lieutenant.

3761
03:49:00.76 --> 03:49:05.76
And when I got there, he says, I heard some stuff about you and what,

3762
03:49:05.76 --> 03:49:07.76
how are we going to make this work?

3763
03:49:07.76 --> 03:49:08.76
And I already made that commitment.

3764
03:49:08.76 --> 03:49:14.76
I says, I'm going to tell you what, so you treat me like a man, not like an idiot or a baby or anything else.

3765
03:49:14.76 --> 03:49:15.76
I said, we're going to get along.

3766
03:49:15.76 --> 03:49:17.76
I said, but don't mess with me.

3767
03:49:17.76 --> 03:49:19.76
So it's a great.

3768
03:49:19.76 --> 03:49:23.76
And, and he actually was my mentor as a lieutenant.

3769
03:49:23.76 --> 03:49:25.76
And then he became a captain.

3770
03:49:25.76 --> 03:49:27.76
So I became a lieutenant.

3771
03:49:27.76 --> 03:49:32.76
And then when he was a captain, but I chief came up, he's the guy who came up and says, I think you should be the bad chief.

3772
03:49:32.76 --> 03:49:33.76
One position.

3773
03:49:33.76 --> 03:49:35.76
I said, I don't know what would be in a bad chief.

3774
03:49:35.76 --> 03:49:36.76
I know what you would be the guy.

3775
03:49:36.76 --> 03:49:39.76
How, how, how many years was this into your career?

3776
03:49:39.76 --> 03:49:41.76
10, about 10 years.

3777
03:49:41.76 --> 03:49:46.76
So you did a good turnaround once your first five years of kind of.

3778
03:49:46.76 --> 03:49:47.76
Oh, yeah, it was bad.

3779
03:49:47.76 --> 03:49:48.76
Being a jackass.

3780
03:49:48.76 --> 03:49:49.76
It was horrible.

3781
03:49:49.76 --> 03:49:54.76
Once you squared that away, then you turned around and really got on the path of doing the right things.

3782
03:49:54.76 --> 03:49:55.76
That commitment.

3783
03:49:55.76 --> 03:49:56.76
Right.

3784
03:49:56.76 --> 03:50:01.76
That commitment of to myself to not let myself go for my dad for this gun.

3785
03:50:01.76 --> 03:50:02.76
I can't do that.

3786
03:50:02.76 --> 03:50:05.76
You know, so yeah, it was, it was the 10 years.

3787
03:50:05.76 --> 03:50:15.76
And then I remember when he told me to go for bad chief and I tested and then I became the bad chief.

3788
03:50:15.76 --> 03:50:19.76
Then all the sabotaging beliefs come in like your two, I mean, you're too small.

3789
03:50:19.76 --> 03:50:20.76
You're not smart enough.

3790
03:50:20.76 --> 03:50:23.76
You're not all this, all the bullshit that some going on.

3791
03:50:23.76 --> 03:50:24.76
Here we go again.

3792
03:50:24.76 --> 03:50:25.76
I'm driving a fire truck.

3793
03:50:25.76 --> 03:50:26.76
I'm a bad chief.

3794
03:50:26.76 --> 03:50:32.76
I didn't realize that everybody in the county hears what the bad chief says on the air.

3795
03:50:32.76 --> 03:50:34.76
And that's a lot of pressure.

3796
03:50:34.76 --> 03:50:35.76
That's like being an incident commander.

3797
03:50:35.76 --> 03:50:36.76
Right.

3798
03:50:36.76 --> 03:50:40.76
I mean, you got the off and stuff, all the air off stuff, all the stuff you say, everybody

3799
03:50:40.76 --> 03:50:43.76
hears, everybody knows everything that you said or think about.

3800
03:50:43.76 --> 03:50:44.76
Right.

3801
03:50:44.76 --> 03:50:45.76
I'm driving down the road.

3802
03:50:45.76 --> 03:50:47.76
I'm going, Oh my God, I even got a panic attack.

3803
03:50:47.76 --> 03:50:52.76
Man, I pull off the side of the road and going, what the hell did I, what are you doing here?

3804
03:50:52.76 --> 03:50:54.76
What the fuck are you doing here?

3805
03:50:54.76 --> 03:50:57.76
And so I called up this lady as part of the reevaluation council.

3806
03:50:57.76 --> 03:50:59.76
I told her what I was feeling.

3807
03:50:59.76 --> 03:51:05.76
She said, okay, this is sounds kind of weird, but she said, I want you to say this.

3808
03:51:05.76 --> 03:51:11.76
I am completely incapable and incompetent to be the battalion chief.

3809
03:51:11.76 --> 03:51:12.76
I said, what?

3810
03:51:12.76 --> 03:51:14.76
She said, yeah, say that.

3811
03:51:14.76 --> 03:51:19.76
So I went, all right, I'm totally completely incapable and incompetent to be the battalion

3812
03:51:19.76 --> 03:51:20.76
chief.

3813
03:51:20.76 --> 03:51:21.76
So what do you think about that?

3814
03:51:21.76 --> 03:51:24.76
I said, I don't know.

3815
03:51:24.76 --> 03:51:28.76
I just kind of, I can't, I'm having a hard time processing that.

3816
03:51:28.76 --> 03:51:32.76
She says, okay, you should now say this.

3817
03:51:32.76 --> 03:51:36.76
And so I said it again, I'm totally completely incapable and incompetent to be the battalion

3818
03:51:36.76 --> 03:51:37.76
chief, right?

3819
03:51:37.76 --> 03:51:46.76
But fortunately or unfortunately, I am the very best person to be the battalion chief.

3820
03:51:46.76 --> 03:51:47.76
So I said that.

3821
03:51:47.76 --> 03:51:50.76
I went, so what do you think about that?

3822
03:51:50.76 --> 03:51:56.76
Yeah, I probably am because it was spooky because at that time, if you became a battalion chief,

3823
03:51:56.76 --> 03:52:00.68
you weren't in union anymore, and that's why a lot of people didn't want to leave the union.

3824
03:52:00.68 --> 03:52:04.32
Because if you screwed up, you're gone.

3825
03:52:04.32 --> 03:52:06.60
That is the sacrificial responsibility piece.

3826
03:52:06.60 --> 03:52:12.52
That's the piece that says, okay, I was going to write a book.

3827
03:52:12.52 --> 03:52:17.32
My book is going to be called Frogman out of water, right?

3828
03:52:17.32 --> 03:52:19.80
Because that's where I was at.

3829
03:52:19.80 --> 03:52:21.68
Now it's changed because of my fire.

3830
03:52:21.68 --> 03:52:25.60
I was going to be Frogman out of fire because there's a whole other dimension about losing

3831
03:52:25.60 --> 03:52:29.64
everything that you ever had in your life, what I just went through with this fire, everything

3832
03:52:29.64 --> 03:52:33.28
I ever had except my kids.

3833
03:52:33.28 --> 03:52:39.08
The greatest treasures in my life, right?

3834
03:52:39.08 --> 03:52:44.68
And being good with them and being bad with them, being a great father with them and being

3835
03:52:44.68 --> 03:52:48.64
a bad father with them, being a good mentor with them and not maybe not being as good

3836
03:52:48.64 --> 03:52:50.84
a mentor as I could be.

3837
03:52:50.84 --> 03:52:53.76
In those three spaces, my dad, he filled those spaces.

3838
03:52:53.76 --> 03:52:56.08
I would hope that I could fill those spaces for my kids.

3839
03:52:56.08 --> 03:53:01.52
That's why even sharing this with you is part of me trying to write my story so that those

3840
03:53:01.52 --> 03:53:06.12
things, these dimensions, the flavor and texture of my life, they understand who the grandpa

3841
03:53:06.12 --> 03:53:07.12
is.

3842
03:53:07.12 --> 03:53:08.64
This is important.

3843
03:53:08.64 --> 03:53:14.12
That's all I have to leave them, right?

3844
03:53:14.12 --> 03:53:16.68
What comes from your heart and what you say?

3845
03:53:16.68 --> 03:53:19.04
When did you end up having kids?

3846
03:53:19.04 --> 03:53:21.64
I was 33.

3847
03:53:21.64 --> 03:53:24.64
So my oldest is 41.

3848
03:53:24.64 --> 03:53:29.56
So were you in the fire department when you started having kids?

3849
03:53:29.56 --> 03:53:31.80
Yeah, I got on fire.

3850
03:53:31.80 --> 03:53:33.92
I met my wife.

3851
03:53:33.92 --> 03:53:36.52
That was crazy.

3852
03:53:36.52 --> 03:53:39.12
I was steaming, man.

3853
03:53:39.12 --> 03:53:40.12
She's a Christian girl.

3854
03:53:40.12 --> 03:53:41.12
I was steaming.

3855
03:53:41.12 --> 03:53:43.52
I met her sister, right?

3856
03:53:43.52 --> 03:53:51.28
And then she comes in and it's like, I wrote a poem and it says, she glowed with the light.

3857
03:53:51.28 --> 03:53:52.28
It was night.

3858
03:53:52.28 --> 03:53:54.40
I didn't know why, but I cared.

3859
03:53:54.40 --> 03:53:57.40
And she's led me softly and gently into the knowledge of love.

3860
03:53:57.40 --> 03:53:59.52
And in May, we three will be one, right?

3861
03:53:59.52 --> 03:54:01.04
When I asked her to marry me.

3862
03:54:01.04 --> 03:54:03.88
Because that night, I went, wow, man, she's hot.

3863
03:54:03.88 --> 03:54:10.000
I mean, there was a devil fighting with an angel, man, because the devil is telling me,

3864
03:54:10.000 --> 03:54:11.000
don't go over there.

3865
03:54:11.000 --> 03:54:12.000
God's telling me, go over there.

3866
03:54:12.000 --> 03:54:13.000
Don't go over there.

3867
03:54:13.000 --> 03:54:16.88
I said, hey, buddy, and the rest goes, Jesus Christ, man, you never having trouble talking

3868
03:54:16.88 --> 03:54:17.88
to girls.

3869
03:54:17.88 --> 03:54:18.88
Go over there and talk to her.

3870
03:54:18.88 --> 03:54:24.000
So I said, hey, would you like to dance?

3871
03:54:24.000 --> 03:54:26.000
I said, I don't dance.

3872
03:54:26.000 --> 03:54:28.000
I said, why not?

3873
03:54:28.000 --> 03:54:29.000
She says, I'm Christian.

3874
03:54:29.000 --> 03:54:30.000
I said, I'm a Catholic.

3875
03:54:30.000 --> 03:54:31.000
I said, but I dance.

3876
03:54:31.000 --> 03:54:32.000
I am not dead.

3877
03:54:32.000 --> 03:54:33.000
She says, no, I don't.

3878
03:54:33.000 --> 03:54:35.80
I said, so my buddy's looking at me.

3879
03:54:35.80 --> 03:54:36.80
So you don't want to lose face.

3880
03:54:36.80 --> 03:54:38.28
I said, well, you mind if I sit down?

3881
03:54:38.28 --> 03:54:39.28
I don't know.

3882
03:54:39.28 --> 03:54:40.28
Good.

3883
03:54:40.28 --> 03:54:41.28
Sure.

3884
03:54:41.28 --> 03:54:42.28
So I sat down.

3885
03:54:42.28 --> 03:54:45.16
I said, well, so it kind of went on.

3886
03:54:45.16 --> 03:54:47.28
So finally she was going to dance with me.

3887
03:54:47.28 --> 03:54:49.48
And that was in the days of platform shoes.

3888
03:54:49.48 --> 03:54:51.48
So I was a lot taller than her.

3889
03:54:51.48 --> 03:54:56.76
Matter of fact, later on, she maybe says, I thought you were taller.

3890
03:54:56.76 --> 03:54:58.84
I love those things.

3891
03:54:58.84 --> 03:55:02.20
But anyway, we did dance.

3892
03:55:02.20 --> 03:55:06.20
And then it was like, and that's what I think maybe when we talk in the spiritual sense,

3893
03:55:06.20 --> 03:55:10.64
where God was trolling with her because all I wanted to do is get laid.

3894
03:55:10.64 --> 03:55:12.24
That was it, right?

3895
03:55:12.24 --> 03:55:18.80
In the teams, the whole sexism thing, the anger thing, all of that, those behaviors.

3896
03:55:18.80 --> 03:55:21.64
And then eventually, you know, it was like, I liked what she had.

3897
03:55:21.64 --> 03:55:25.36
I liked what I was missing, you know?

3898
03:55:25.36 --> 03:55:29.40
And that's what I'm saying that even after you accepted Christ or you get into the Christian

3899
03:55:29.40 --> 03:55:34.60
thing that you'll let loose of it, you'll go somewhere else because the alternatives

3900
03:55:34.60 --> 03:55:38.72
that you've settled for in the past, if you don't keep it in front of you, it's like

3901
03:55:38.72 --> 03:55:43.12
seals or guys that operate, but they don't keep the basic training in front of their

3902
03:55:43.12 --> 03:55:44.12
face.

3903
03:55:44.12 --> 03:55:48.12
And so then they get killed or they hurt somebody or they don't pay attention to it.

3904
03:55:48.12 --> 03:55:49.12
And that's what happens.

3905
03:55:49.12 --> 03:55:51.60
That's the way the world is.

3906
03:55:51.60 --> 03:55:54.36
This is the way that the world is.

3907
03:55:54.36 --> 03:55:58.92
And if we don't take care of it, then we are like sheep led to the slaughter, man.

3908
03:55:58.92 --> 03:56:01.56
We're going to be taken out somewhere, you know?

3909
03:56:01.56 --> 03:56:04.32
And so doing this is part of that.

3910
03:56:04.32 --> 03:56:09.40
The fire department saved my life because of that being able to party or whatever that

3911
03:56:09.40 --> 03:56:10.68
was.

3912
03:56:10.68 --> 03:56:16.64
And then the responsibility that I had as a bad chief to keep my guys alive, to change,

3913
03:56:16.64 --> 03:56:19.000
to tell a captain that has 20 years on the job.

3914
03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:20.96
Hey, man, I need you to do incident command.

3915
03:56:20.96 --> 03:56:22.32
I need you to wear your bunker gear.

3916
03:56:22.32 --> 03:56:23.32
I need you to wear your coat.

3917
03:56:23.32 --> 03:56:24.92
I need you to tell me where you're going.

3918
03:56:24.92 --> 03:56:28.60
And this and that, and he's telling me, I've been doing this for 20 years.

3919
03:56:28.60 --> 03:56:32.64
You've only been on your 10 years and you want to tell me what to do?

3920
03:56:32.64 --> 03:56:35.92
And the frogman stuff comes out and I go, yeah.

3921
03:56:35.92 --> 03:56:39.80
So, well, you don't know as much as I do.

3922
03:56:39.80 --> 03:56:41.96
I said, no, but I do know about being in combat.

3923
03:56:41.96 --> 03:56:43.20
I know about getting shot at.

3924
03:56:43.20 --> 03:56:45.16
I do know what the war we're fighting.

3925
03:56:45.16 --> 03:56:47.04
I do know the training that we need.

3926
03:56:47.04 --> 03:56:52.84
And the other thing I know is that Chief Gustavus' wife told me a long time ago, if I get you

3927
03:56:52.84 --> 03:56:55.12
killed, I'm in trouble.

3928
03:56:55.12 --> 03:56:57.32
And Karen is the one that I'm worried about.

3929
03:56:57.32 --> 03:57:02.12
And so for me to tell you to put on your bunker gear and everything else is easy.

3930
03:57:02.12 --> 03:57:04.48
And I'll write your ass up if you don't.

3931
03:57:04.48 --> 03:57:05.48
You wouldn't do that to me.

3932
03:57:05.48 --> 03:57:06.96
I said, try it.

3933
03:57:06.96 --> 03:57:09.000
Oh, God, so good, man.

3934
03:57:09.000 --> 03:57:10.000
There's a fire alarm.

3935
03:57:10.000 --> 03:57:11.000
What do your grades go, man?

3936
03:57:11.000 --> 03:57:12.80
They go out on a fire alarm.

3937
03:57:12.80 --> 03:57:13.88
He gets off the truck.

3938
03:57:13.88 --> 03:57:14.88
I just followed him.

3939
03:57:14.88 --> 03:57:15.88
Just two engine response.

3940
03:57:15.88 --> 03:57:19.28
And then me, I rolled up, I sit on the corner.

3941
03:57:19.28 --> 03:57:20.84
I didn't go arrive.

3942
03:57:20.84 --> 03:57:22.04
I didn't tell my response.

3943
03:57:22.04 --> 03:57:24.16
I just followed him.

3944
03:57:24.16 --> 03:57:27.40
And I don't have to run on a fire alarm.

3945
03:57:27.40 --> 03:57:28.40
So I'm waiting.

3946
03:57:28.40 --> 03:57:31.76
I watch him get out of the truck and he looks down the street.

3947
03:57:31.76 --> 03:57:34.40
Excuse me.

3948
03:57:34.40 --> 03:57:38.28
Gets back up in his truck, puts on his helmet, grabs his gear, throws it down, puts on his

3949
03:57:38.28 --> 03:57:39.28
coat, puts on his stuff.

3950
03:57:39.28 --> 03:57:41.76
He looks at me and he goes in the building.

3951
03:57:41.76 --> 03:57:45.24
So he had 25, I think it was 2501 at that time.

3952
03:57:45.24 --> 03:57:46.40
It was engine one.

3953
03:57:46.40 --> 03:57:50.88
I'm a rival sprinkler alarm third floor.

3954
03:57:50.88 --> 03:57:52.32
So I heard that.

3955
03:57:52.32 --> 03:57:53.32
Nothing visible.

3956
03:57:53.32 --> 03:57:57.44
I just left that night.

3957
03:57:57.44 --> 03:58:02.28
And this is where I learned a lot about his example too, was if I'm going to have this

3958
03:58:02.28 --> 03:58:06.56
stuff going down with somebody, an officer, good officer takes that, especially an ex-host

3959
03:58:06.56 --> 03:58:10.68
or somebody to another room, not in front of the people.

3960
03:58:10.68 --> 03:58:11.68
So he said, can I talk to you?

3961
03:58:11.68 --> 03:58:17.16
I said, yes.

3962
03:58:17.16 --> 03:58:18.84
His office, because the captain had one.

3963
03:58:18.84 --> 03:58:19.84
He said, yeah.

3964
03:58:19.84 --> 03:58:21.64
He says, you wouldn't have wrote me up, would you?

3965
03:58:21.64 --> 03:58:22.64
I saw you.

3966
03:58:22.64 --> 03:58:29.40
And this guy said, yeah, I would.

3967
03:58:29.40 --> 03:58:30.76
Okay.

3968
03:58:30.76 --> 03:58:34.94
After that, he talked to me on the radio, because when we were fighting fires, he loved

3969
03:58:34.94 --> 03:58:38.000
to see me show up, because we'd gone into some fires where other people are bailing

3970
03:58:38.000 --> 03:58:39.000
out.

3971
03:58:39.000 --> 03:58:41.48
So he knew how I would fight fires.

3972
03:58:41.48 --> 03:58:43.52
And I gave him that respect.

3973
03:58:43.52 --> 03:58:44.52
He gave me that respect.

3974
03:58:44.52 --> 03:58:49.16
And my whole shift after a while, all the promotions were coming off my shift, because

3975
03:58:49.16 --> 03:58:51.60
I wanted to do what we did in the teams.

3976
03:58:51.60 --> 03:58:54.16
I want to teach you to take my job.

3977
03:58:54.16 --> 03:58:56.24
I want you to be better than me.

3978
03:58:56.24 --> 03:59:00.64
If you know more than me, and you're better than me, when things go down, you'll see

3979
03:59:00.64 --> 03:59:02.84
what I can't see.

3980
03:59:02.84 --> 03:59:04.84
That's what I loved about the team.

3981
03:59:04.84 --> 03:59:09.88
So for one of my misters saying some stuff, and then for one of my teammates going, you

3982
03:59:09.88 --> 03:59:10.88
fucking crazy?

3983
03:59:10.88 --> 03:59:13.92
Why are we going to do that?

3984
03:59:13.92 --> 03:59:19.04
And it wasn't like, who has the bigger sword, right?

3985
03:59:19.04 --> 03:59:23.32
It's like, tell me why, because of this.

3986
03:59:23.32 --> 03:59:26.32
Yeah, it makes sense.

3987
03:59:26.32 --> 03:59:31.92
So that's why when we look at the history of the teams, my era and your era, is that

3988
03:59:31.92 --> 03:59:37.12
I don't know, and I'll never be able to, but that's what I want back in the teams.

3989
03:59:37.12 --> 03:59:39.24
That's what I want in fire departments.

3990
03:59:39.24 --> 03:59:44.08
I want all my guys to know more than me, because, I mean, there was like, oh, why do we want

3991
03:59:44.08 --> 03:59:45.76
to do hazmat?

3992
03:59:45.76 --> 03:59:50.12
Because I brought hazmat in, because I was the little guy on the end of the ladder,

3993
03:59:50.12 --> 03:59:51.80
I did ice rescue, way different.

3994
03:59:51.80 --> 03:59:54.40
That's where the Gumbi suits came from me, because they shoved my ass out there with

3995
03:59:54.40 --> 03:59:55.40
bunker gear on.

3996
03:59:55.40 --> 03:59:57.32
Well, hell no, I'm not going to do this.

3997
03:59:57.32 --> 03:59:59.04
There's a better way.

3998
03:59:59.04 --> 04:00:02.40
Ice diving, we always ice dove in wetsuits.

3999
04:00:02.40 --> 04:00:05.24
There's dry suits, there's stuff that we can wear, right?

4000
04:00:05.24 --> 04:00:06.24
Swift water, right?

4001
04:00:06.24 --> 04:00:11.40
Teach guys how to be around swift water, because if they don't know, they die.

4002
04:00:11.40 --> 04:00:12.40
That's the thing.

4003
04:00:12.40 --> 04:00:17.32
You learn something, you die, the consequences of our mistakes, the consequences of our business

4004
04:00:17.32 --> 04:00:25.28
being in the teams, being in fire, and being a cop, right?

4005
04:00:25.28 --> 04:00:36.000
And so, you mentioned this a couple times, but it's a very horrible and ironic end to

4006
04:00:36.000 --> 04:00:41.04
your fire career is that when you, when you retired from the fire department and you ended

4007
04:00:41.04 --> 04:00:47.56
up losing everything in a fire.

4008
04:00:47.56 --> 04:00:53.68
And it's the, it's the Marshall fire, December 30th, 20, this is just, just what last year?

4009
04:00:53.68 --> 04:00:55.40
It'll be a year coming up.

4010
04:00:55.40 --> 04:00:56.40
2021.

4011
04:00:56.40 --> 04:00:57.40
New years.

4012
04:00:57.40 --> 04:00:59.72
This fire breaks out, you're retired.

4013
04:00:59.72 --> 04:01:02.32
You're just enjoying life.

4014
04:01:02.32 --> 04:01:07.52
This fire breaks out in Colorado, wing gusts of 115 miles an hour.

4015
04:01:07.52 --> 04:01:16.56
There's 6,000 acres burned, 184, sorry, 1,084 structures, either totally destroyed or damaged.

4016
04:01:16.56 --> 04:01:20.64
$500 million worth of damage.

4017
04:01:20.64 --> 04:01:24.48
Two people killed, some other burn injuries.

4018
04:01:24.48 --> 04:01:27.64
And one of the things that burned was your house.

4019
04:01:27.64 --> 04:01:29.56
How the, how did this happen?

4020
04:01:29.56 --> 04:01:33.44
In Old Town, that's my house is in Old Town Superior.

4021
04:01:33.44 --> 04:01:37.68
They're still looking at the causes of it, but they do know that fire happened and then

4022
04:01:37.68 --> 04:01:41.40
the wind gusts came in, like you said, at 100 miles an hour.

4023
04:01:41.40 --> 04:01:45.36
And when that, when the fuels are that way, there, it's like, you ever take like a, like

4024
04:01:45.36 --> 04:01:47.32
a torch when you're doing heating a pipe?

4025
04:01:47.32 --> 04:01:48.32
Yeah.

4026
04:01:48.32 --> 04:01:50.08
And go, that's the kind of fire it was.

4027
04:01:50.08 --> 04:01:53.68
It was a super heated, wind driven fire.

4028
04:01:53.68 --> 04:01:59.12
And so the contact is not only just a conflagration of one structure to the next structure, it's

4029
04:01:59.12 --> 04:02:04.24
also the heat and fire generated by the, by the winds, right?

4030
04:02:04.24 --> 04:02:05.24
So did you get evacuated?

4031
04:02:05.24 --> 04:02:06.24
You know where I was?

4032
04:02:06.24 --> 04:02:07.24
No idea.

4033
04:02:07.24 --> 04:02:11.88
I went and got my ex-wife because there's a Marine, right?

4034
04:02:11.88 --> 04:02:14.64
A little Marine, red rich.

4035
04:02:14.64 --> 04:02:16.16
He said, hey, I saw him at the bowling alley.

4036
04:02:16.16 --> 04:02:17.36
You want to come down and watch me?

4037
04:02:17.36 --> 04:02:19.24
And he always invites me, but I never go.

4038
04:02:19.24 --> 04:02:20.24
He's a muffler guy.

4039
04:02:20.24 --> 04:02:26.000
I'm going, so I, he says, I'd like to see Rose because we were just the normal might like

4040
04:02:26.000 --> 04:02:28.000
you didn't know anything about a fire because this thing happened.

4041
04:02:28.000 --> 04:02:29.000
Nothing.

4042
04:02:29.000 --> 04:02:31.72
And he says, the normal night he says, you want to come watch me bowling bowling?

4043
04:02:31.72 --> 04:02:32.72
Yeah.

4044
04:02:32.72 --> 04:02:36.24
So I go, I put on my seal, tried and put on my Marine, the flat jacket with the seal

4045
04:02:36.24 --> 04:02:37.24
tried on it.

4046
04:02:37.24 --> 04:02:41.68
So we're going to go see the Marine, you know, put on a crappy shirt and put on my boots,

4047
04:02:41.68 --> 04:02:44.28
left my dog chief in a kennel, right?

4048
04:02:44.28 --> 04:02:47.12
I put him in the kennel because he eats my stuff.

4049
04:02:47.12 --> 04:02:50.88
So I that night, that day I told Rose, I'll pick you up.

4050
04:02:50.88 --> 04:02:53.000
Usually she would come to my house.

4051
04:02:53.000 --> 04:02:54.12
Then we would go.

4052
04:02:54.12 --> 04:02:56.96
If she'd have come into my house, her house would have, her car would have been burned

4053
04:02:56.96 --> 04:02:57.96
up.

4054
04:02:57.96 --> 04:03:00.20
And I told her, I told her, I'm going to go to the Jaguar that my buddy, the team guy

4055
04:03:00.20 --> 04:03:01.20
had sold me.

4056
04:03:01.20 --> 04:03:02.20
It was in there.

4057
04:03:02.20 --> 04:03:05.40
I had my coat and we took my truck.

4058
04:03:05.40 --> 04:03:07.48
I'm in Denver at the bowling alley.

4059
04:03:07.48 --> 04:03:09.04
I get this call from a neighbor.

4060
04:03:09.04 --> 04:03:11.68
Hey, Gil, yeah, you got a reverse 911.

4061
04:03:11.68 --> 04:03:13.76
You got to get out of superior.

4062
04:03:13.76 --> 04:03:14.76
You get it?

4063
04:03:14.76 --> 04:03:18.52
I said, no, I reverse 911 is when make notification of something's coming.

4064
04:03:18.52 --> 04:03:22.28
Well, I wasn't, I didn't get that notification.

4065
04:03:22.28 --> 04:03:25.24
For some reason I wasn't on the, on the callback.

4066
04:03:25.24 --> 04:03:26.24
I said, really?

4067
04:03:26.24 --> 04:03:27.24
He goes, yeah.

4068
04:03:27.24 --> 04:03:30.12
So prior to that, the girl that I was dating, we'd broken up.

4069
04:03:30.12 --> 04:03:34.48
She called me too and said, Hey, you know, there's reverse 911.

4070
04:03:34.48 --> 04:03:35.48
I said, yeah.

4071
04:03:35.48 --> 04:03:37.64
I didn't know at that time.

4072
04:03:37.64 --> 04:03:41.04
She said, well, I can go down and I'm not in town.

4073
04:03:41.04 --> 04:03:42.40
I can go down and pick chief up.

4074
04:03:42.40 --> 04:03:46.44
I said, nah, I don't want to be beholding to her, right?

4075
04:03:46.44 --> 04:03:47.44
I'll find somebody.

4076
04:03:47.44 --> 04:03:50.40
And so then, then that's when the other neighbor called me up.

4077
04:03:50.40 --> 04:03:51.84
I said, nah, I didn't know him well enough.

4078
04:03:51.84 --> 04:03:55.68
I'll call one of the other neighbors, guys that were in my neighborhood.

4079
04:03:55.68 --> 04:03:56.68
They were all gone.

4080
04:03:56.68 --> 04:03:58.68
I broke up on the hill watching the fire.

4081
04:03:58.68 --> 04:04:01.04
So then I get the callback from the first guy.

4082
04:04:01.04 --> 04:04:02.04
He says, guilt.

4083
04:04:02.04 --> 04:04:06.24
He says, my buddy that was down there, he says, broke your door down and he's got your

4084
04:04:06.24 --> 04:04:07.24
dog.

4085
04:04:07.24 --> 04:04:10.52
I said, broke my door down because I don't like my doors.

4086
04:04:10.52 --> 04:04:12.28
You know, that's kind of the community.

4087
04:04:12.28 --> 04:04:14.16
He says, yeah, he broke your door down.

4088
04:04:14.16 --> 04:04:15.56
He says, broke my door down.

4089
04:04:15.56 --> 04:04:16.56
He says, don't be mad.

4090
04:04:16.56 --> 04:04:18.92
I said, I'm not mad, but he had to break my door down.

4091
04:04:18.92 --> 04:04:25.04
He goes, yeah, because I was thinking it was evacuation, not the fire.

4092
04:04:25.04 --> 04:04:32.24
And so then the other thing too, then I asked the guy who lived wrong when I got him, when

4093
04:04:32.24 --> 04:04:35.52
I picked up my dog, I said, what did you close the door?

4094
04:04:35.52 --> 04:04:40.16
Because if the door is open, I always leave the upstairs open so that my dog can look

4095
04:04:40.16 --> 04:04:41.16
out.

4096
04:04:41.16 --> 04:04:44.16
So then what that does is it creates a draft.

4097
04:04:44.16 --> 04:04:46.76
It creates a draft, a chimney, right?

4098
04:04:46.76 --> 04:04:49.48
So I'm going, well, that doesn't sound good.

4099
04:04:49.48 --> 04:04:53.52
So two days later, because they wouldn't let us in, two days later, I called another one

4100
04:04:53.52 --> 04:04:56.64
of my firefighters from Boulder and said, hey, so can you get down there and check it

4101
04:04:56.64 --> 04:04:57.64
out?

4102
04:04:57.64 --> 04:04:59.68
So I'll check it out, chief.

4103
04:04:59.68 --> 04:05:03.28
So then I've already been retired for 10 years, right?

4104
04:05:03.28 --> 04:05:04.28
2012, yeah.

4105
04:05:04.28 --> 04:05:06.08
Did you see it on the news?

4106
04:05:06.08 --> 04:05:08.76
Yeah, yeah, but it wasn't showing real close-ups.

4107
04:05:08.76 --> 04:05:10.44
Everything was from way back.

4108
04:05:10.44 --> 04:05:11.44
Got it.

4109
04:05:11.44 --> 04:05:16.28
And they were saying that Old Town was affected, but they didn't talk about the devastation

4110
04:05:16.28 --> 04:05:18.76
because nobody was getting down there.

4111
04:05:18.76 --> 04:05:24.60
And so I'm like, well, whatever, only easy days yesterday, man.

4112
04:05:24.60 --> 04:05:26.76
Can I change the temperature of the water?

4113
04:05:26.76 --> 04:05:27.76
No.

4114
04:05:27.76 --> 04:05:28.76
Right?

4115
04:05:28.76 --> 04:05:30.20
That's what I mean.

4116
04:05:30.20 --> 04:05:36.12
The development of that, the revealing of who I am is that little boy going, hey, I can

4117
04:05:36.12 --> 04:05:39.20
only take care of what I can take care of, right?

4118
04:05:39.20 --> 04:05:46.60
And one of my friends' friends, well, actually Rose, my ex-wife, her friend said, I can't

4119
04:05:46.60 --> 04:05:49.04
believe you're so calm about it.

4120
04:05:49.04 --> 04:05:53.12
You know, other people, I can't believe you're so calm about it.

4121
04:05:53.12 --> 04:05:54.12
Time and chance, man.

4122
04:05:54.12 --> 04:05:57.04
A guy gets killed, you don't get killed.

4123
04:05:57.04 --> 04:05:58.88
What can he do about it?

4124
04:05:58.88 --> 04:06:02.48
You can have, feel bad about it, but you can't change it.

4125
04:06:02.48 --> 04:06:04.68
You can have the emotion, right?

4126
04:06:04.68 --> 04:06:12.84
When we talk about things, we tell story and we have these because it's emotional, right?

4127
04:06:12.84 --> 04:06:18.56
It's emotional because it starts creating in you that piece about who you really are.

4128
04:06:18.56 --> 04:06:23.76
It starts opening it up for you to see yourself, to say, hey, I am going somewhere good or

4129
04:06:23.76 --> 04:06:24.76
I'm not.

4130
04:06:24.76 --> 04:06:27.12
Well, he told me he was mad at God.

4131
04:06:27.12 --> 04:06:28.72
Ah, God, why did God do that?

4132
04:06:28.72 --> 04:06:33.12
I'm a Christian, I'm a bishop and all that other kind of stuff.

4133
04:06:33.12 --> 04:06:35.16
For me, it was like, why would I be mad at him?

4134
04:06:35.16 --> 04:06:38.28
He didn't start it, right?

4135
04:06:38.28 --> 04:06:39.28
And he's invisible.

4136
04:06:39.28 --> 04:06:43.44
He's invisible God, I'm having hope and invisible thing that I can't see anyway.

4137
04:06:43.44 --> 04:06:45.88
And he's given me another house to live in.

4138
04:06:45.88 --> 04:06:47.28
He rescued my dog, right?

4139
04:06:47.28 --> 04:06:52.000
I mean, whatever the deal is.

4140
04:06:52.000 --> 04:06:53.56
And then the guy tells me, well, you know.

4141
04:06:53.56 --> 04:06:57.72
So now this is the firefighter that you knew that you said, can you go check it out?

4142
04:06:57.72 --> 04:07:01.64
Well, no, no, no, the firefighter that he went and checked out, he calls me up and says,

4143
04:07:01.64 --> 04:07:02.64
I said, how are things?

4144
04:07:02.64 --> 04:07:04.92
He goes, better than you, chief.

4145
04:07:04.92 --> 04:07:07.000
I said, yeah, well, he's left.

4146
04:07:07.000 --> 04:07:08.000
He said, nothing.

4147
04:07:08.000 --> 04:07:09.60
I said, I mean, nothing.

4148
04:07:09.60 --> 04:07:10.60
He said, nothing.

4149
04:07:10.60 --> 04:07:15.12
There's, I swear to God, walls, roof, nothing.

4150
04:07:15.12 --> 04:07:17.76
So I went over and I looked with my family.

4151
04:07:17.76 --> 04:07:19.76
The asphalt singles are usually around.

4152
04:07:19.76 --> 04:07:21.44
They were in dust.

4153
04:07:21.44 --> 04:07:24.44
There were no, there were no two by fours in the walls.

4154
04:07:24.44 --> 04:07:26.72
The only thing that was left were gusset plates.

4155
04:07:26.72 --> 04:07:29.000
Things that were metal like stove.

4156
04:07:29.000 --> 04:07:30.28
I had a wood burning stove.

4157
04:07:30.28 --> 04:07:36.24
The only thing that was left was the top, you know, washer, dryers, all gone, everything.

4158
04:07:36.24 --> 04:07:41.60
I looked at some pictures online and it just, there's nothing left but sort of the concrete

4159
04:07:41.60 --> 04:07:42.60
foundations.

4160
04:07:42.60 --> 04:07:43.60
Right.

4161
04:07:43.60 --> 04:07:45.44
And then they took my foundations out.

4162
04:07:45.44 --> 04:07:47.52
That's the other thing, man.

4163
04:07:47.52 --> 04:07:52.20
I felt the full force of water, right?

4164
04:07:52.20 --> 04:07:53.20
Through the surf, right?

4165
04:07:53.20 --> 04:07:56.32
And if you're not prepared for that, it'll jack you up.

4166
04:07:56.32 --> 04:07:59.72
Got to see if it's sniffing for you, right?

4167
04:07:59.72 --> 04:08:02.40
Fire, air.

4168
04:08:02.40 --> 04:08:06.000
You don't have to shoot on, you're going to die, right?

4169
04:08:06.000 --> 04:08:08.04
And to land warfare, man, it moves.

4170
04:08:08.04 --> 04:08:10.96
It's always dynamic, the war piece, right?

4171
04:08:10.96 --> 04:08:19.40
All the jumping, just jumping out of boats and all the whole recovery thing and fire.

4172
04:08:19.40 --> 04:08:22.24
I thought I knew fire.

4173
04:08:22.24 --> 04:08:23.44
I put out a lot of fires.

4174
04:08:23.44 --> 04:08:26.96
There'd been too lot of fires, but that one was totally consuming.

4175
04:08:26.96 --> 04:08:35.76
So when it talks about Sodom and Gomorrah being completely gone, that fire is, you know,

4176
04:08:35.76 --> 04:08:39.80
people would sit there and say, well, it really humbled you, right?

4177
04:08:39.80 --> 04:08:40.92
No.

4178
04:08:40.92 --> 04:08:45.16
Fire, the water, all that, that whole thing.

4179
04:08:45.16 --> 04:08:50.32
The humbling piece was the generosity of people like Mama Lee for her to call me up.

4180
04:08:50.32 --> 04:08:53.20
Say, hey, I understand you've gone through some stuff.

4181
04:08:53.20 --> 04:08:55.84
I don't even know who she is, you know?

4182
04:08:55.84 --> 04:08:57.96
And so I liked that.

4183
04:08:57.96 --> 04:08:59.28
I always want to confirm your number.

4184
04:08:59.28 --> 04:09:02.20
I want to help you out.

4185
04:09:02.20 --> 04:09:08.76
And when she did, she sent, you know, I said, look, man, I see, if you heard it, get to

4186
04:09:08.76 --> 04:09:11.36
Colorado, I need to give you a hug.

4187
04:09:11.36 --> 04:09:15.000
And then something I did, and that's where I ran into you, right?

4188
04:09:15.000 --> 04:09:21.12
That fire, the Southern guy came up, he was a revitalist, the name of the organization.

4189
04:09:21.12 --> 04:09:22.56
It's a firefighters deal.

4190
04:09:22.56 --> 04:09:25.40
The family, the fire family too, right?

4191
04:09:25.40 --> 04:09:30.40
And the frog family, they set up the Navy SEAL fund for me, right?

4192
04:09:30.40 --> 04:09:32.64
A guy, Julio Fitzgibbons, calls me up.

4193
04:09:32.64 --> 04:09:33.64
Hey, SB, yeah.

4194
04:09:33.64 --> 04:09:35.64
Do you know him?

4195
04:09:35.64 --> 04:09:36.64
Yeah.

4196
04:09:36.64 --> 04:09:40.04
Hey, SB, yeah, he says, Class 42, right?

4197
04:09:40.04 --> 04:09:44.32
Well, yeah, I said, what were your top medals?

4198
04:09:44.32 --> 04:09:45.32
So what were your top medals?

4199
04:09:45.32 --> 04:09:49.56
They were Purple Heart, Navy Combination with the V, Combat Action Ribbon.

4200
04:09:49.56 --> 04:09:51.56
Okay, thank you, goodbye.

4201
04:09:51.56 --> 04:09:53.08
So what the hell's that about?

4202
04:09:53.08 --> 04:09:55.12
So then I get a call from Dozenbach.

4203
04:09:55.12 --> 04:09:56.76
Do you know him?

4204
04:09:56.76 --> 04:09:57.76
Anyway, there.

4205
04:09:57.76 --> 04:09:59.64
And so he says, this is...

4206
04:09:59.64 --> 04:10:01.76
I think that's Dozer.

4207
04:10:01.76 --> 04:10:03.48
Yeah, yeah, it is.

4208
04:10:03.48 --> 04:10:04.48
And it's Chris Dozer.

4209
04:10:04.48 --> 04:10:08.32
He says, yeah, he says, well, I got your name from Fitzgibbons.

4210
04:10:08.32 --> 04:10:10.32
He submitted your name into the Navy SEAL fund.

4211
04:10:10.32 --> 04:10:11.32
I said, for what?

4212
04:10:11.32 --> 04:10:15.68
He says, we're going to do a fundraiser for you.

4213
04:10:15.68 --> 04:10:18.32
I'm like, what?

4214
04:10:18.32 --> 04:10:20.04
And he says, yeah, so we'll get back with you.

4215
04:10:20.04 --> 04:10:21.04
Hangs up.

4216
04:10:21.04 --> 04:10:25.48
So I'm like, what the hell's going on here?

4217
04:10:25.48 --> 04:10:31.68
And then this revital guy, named Jordan Long, he's a firefighter, right?

4218
04:10:31.68 --> 04:10:37.40
And he was a firefighter that went through some emotional stuff, quit being a firefighter,

4219
04:10:37.40 --> 04:10:44.64
but he's since then started intervention for post-traumatic stress, firefighters and cops

4220
04:10:44.64 --> 04:10:45.76
really helping them out.

4221
04:10:45.76 --> 04:10:47.36
And so he calls me up.

4222
04:10:47.36 --> 04:10:48.92
So I want you to come down to this place.

4223
04:10:48.92 --> 04:10:50.12
Do you have any coats?

4224
04:10:50.12 --> 04:10:52.16
All I had was that SEAL coat.

4225
04:10:52.16 --> 04:10:53.72
My best coat was burned up.

4226
04:10:53.72 --> 04:10:54.72
All my gloves were burned up.

4227
04:10:54.72 --> 04:10:55.72
My best.

4228
04:10:55.72 --> 04:10:58.52
I'm wearing the most raggedy shoes that I ever had.

4229
04:10:58.52 --> 04:11:02.000
So I show up and I love my gray coat, right?

4230
04:11:02.000 --> 04:11:04.16
So he has a gray coat there and the gloves is here.

4231
04:11:04.16 --> 04:11:05.44
He says, you take these with you.

4232
04:11:05.44 --> 04:11:08.12
I'm like, it was a warmer coat than my coat.

4233
04:11:08.12 --> 04:11:11.80
So God gave me a coat that was warmer than the coat that got burned up.

4234
04:11:11.80 --> 04:11:12.80
Right?

4235
04:11:12.80 --> 04:11:14.36
Give me some shoes.

4236
04:11:14.36 --> 04:11:16.68
They're nice and some gloves.

4237
04:11:16.68 --> 04:11:22.48
And so then this is how the world goes around.

4238
04:11:22.48 --> 04:11:32.36
He says, I got this furniture, this firefighters, whatever the brother law, brother isn't getting

4239
04:11:32.36 --> 04:11:33.36
married, but he has furniture.

4240
04:11:33.36 --> 04:11:35.000
And if you want to go up and look at it.

4241
04:11:35.000 --> 04:11:39.36
I said, all right, up in Dillon, up in Bailey, Colorado.

4242
04:11:39.36 --> 04:11:40.36
So I drive up there.

4243
04:11:40.36 --> 04:11:41.52
Let's get it to do this.

4244
04:11:41.52 --> 04:11:43.28
He said, oh yeah, furniture upstairs.

4245
04:11:43.28 --> 04:11:44.28
We'll go inside.

4246
04:11:44.28 --> 04:11:45.44
He says, this is my cousin.

4247
04:11:45.44 --> 04:11:46.44
He's in the garage, right?

4248
04:11:46.44 --> 04:11:48.08
Oh, nice to meet you.

4249
04:11:48.08 --> 04:11:50.08
I said, I'm Gellisp.

4250
04:11:50.08 --> 04:11:53.52
No, he says, no, he says, you're Espy.

4251
04:11:53.52 --> 04:11:54.52
I look at him and go, what?

4252
04:11:54.52 --> 04:11:56.000
He says, you're Espy.

4253
04:11:56.000 --> 04:11:58.000
He says, I know you.

4254
04:11:58.000 --> 04:11:59.76
I said, where do you know me from?

4255
04:11:59.76 --> 04:12:02.72
He says, you're in Seelton with my dad, Tom Dixon.

4256
04:12:02.72 --> 04:12:03.72
I said, bullshit.

4257
04:12:03.72 --> 04:12:06.000
He goes, no, yeah.

4258
04:12:06.000 --> 04:12:08.20
I knew him when he was a kid, right?

4259
04:12:08.20 --> 04:12:10.84
So there's that Tom Dixon thing, right?

4260
04:12:10.84 --> 04:12:12.08
Seel.

4261
04:12:12.08 --> 04:12:13.24
I grab all my furniture.

4262
04:12:13.24 --> 04:12:14.96
I take it back.

4263
04:12:14.96 --> 04:12:21.72
The house that I have, whatever was referred to by a cop, referred me to another guy, and

4264
04:12:21.72 --> 04:12:25.16
they got the house that I'm renting right now.

4265
04:12:25.16 --> 04:12:26.72
I'm with my daughter.

4266
04:12:26.72 --> 04:12:29.80
We're looking around and she says, dad, look at this house.

4267
04:12:29.80 --> 04:12:31.24
I go, yeah, it's pretty cool.

4268
04:12:31.24 --> 04:12:35.80
It says, no, it says with the floor pattern, the floor layout.

4269
04:12:35.80 --> 04:12:39.96
It's the same as Grandma and Grandpa's house in Pueblo.

4270
04:12:39.96 --> 04:12:47.12
Two bedrooms on the side, front porch, kitchen, and a little basement.

4271
04:12:47.12 --> 04:12:48.48
The chief has a fenced yard.

4272
04:12:48.48 --> 04:12:50.36
He didn't even have a fenced yard where I was at.

4273
04:12:50.36 --> 04:12:52.72
I used to have to yell at him.

4274
04:12:52.72 --> 04:12:53.72
He has a fenced yard.

4275
04:12:53.72 --> 04:13:00.44
I got furniture from another team guy that knows that guy.

4276
04:13:00.44 --> 04:13:05.68
And now I'm meeting two old guys in the dog park that I go to.

4277
04:13:05.68 --> 04:13:09.88
And I really know too much about you, but there's kids whose name's Artum, right?

4278
04:13:09.88 --> 04:13:11.60
He watches your stuff.

4279
04:13:11.60 --> 04:13:13.32
He says, oh, what are you doing?

4280
04:13:13.32 --> 04:13:16.80
I don't know what to do with the podcast with this guy, Jacko.

4281
04:13:16.80 --> 04:13:18.28
Oh, I know him.

4282
04:13:18.28 --> 04:13:21.12
I go, well, he knows your deal.

4283
04:13:21.12 --> 04:13:23.04
I'm going, well, who is he?

4284
04:13:23.04 --> 04:13:24.04
He told me about you.

4285
04:13:24.04 --> 04:13:26.24
And he goes, yeah, there's another guy named Echo.

4286
04:13:26.24 --> 04:13:27.24
He's a big guy.

4287
04:13:27.24 --> 04:13:29.76
I go, yeah, he says, yeah, I want to bring you some shirts.

4288
04:13:29.76 --> 04:13:33.72
He says, you better take some extra lardes.

4289
04:13:33.72 --> 04:13:37.32
You don't see how the circle is, right?

4290
04:13:37.32 --> 04:13:39.72
And there are no coincidences.

4291
04:13:39.72 --> 04:13:45.000
You know, and that fire, I thought I was a seal.

4292
04:13:45.000 --> 04:13:46.44
I thought I was bad.

4293
04:13:46.44 --> 04:13:50.44
I thought, you know, there's this thing, a friend of mine, she told me, she says, I

4294
04:13:50.44 --> 04:13:52.28
think you say that you're not a seal.

4295
04:13:52.28 --> 04:13:55.56
You don't want to identify with it, but I think you do because you got a lot of seal

4296
04:13:55.56 --> 04:13:57.16
stuff, you know?

4297
04:13:57.16 --> 04:13:59.08
So then I started feeling insecure about that.

4298
04:13:59.08 --> 04:14:01.64
That, well, maybe she's right.

4299
04:14:01.64 --> 04:14:02.96
But all my stuff is gone.

4300
04:14:02.96 --> 04:14:04.84
My metals and people have given me back.

4301
04:14:04.84 --> 04:14:07.52
I'm consciously, I mean, I got like some coins and stuff.

4302
04:14:07.52 --> 04:14:12.68
I kind of, I'm hesitant about getting all this stuff back because now I got to keep

4303
04:14:12.68 --> 04:14:13.68
it.

4304
04:14:13.68 --> 04:14:18.36
I got to put it on the wall or I just got this thing from frogman.

4305
04:14:18.36 --> 04:14:20.44
Um, distillery.

4306
04:14:20.44 --> 04:14:25.48
It's called, uh, art, the art of art of the spirit distillery.

4307
04:14:25.48 --> 04:14:26.48
His name is Paul.

4308
04:14:26.48 --> 04:14:30.52
We tapped a keg for Mike Thornton and I was there for that one of two seals.

4309
04:14:30.52 --> 04:14:31.52
Right.

4310
04:14:31.52 --> 04:14:37.48
Now I got a hat, you know, and I got two bottles of whiskey that now it's like, oh, I

4311
04:14:37.48 --> 04:14:39.52
don't want to get too much, you know?

4312
04:14:39.52 --> 04:14:43.08
And, um, because I'm thinking, trying to, trying to build my house.

4313
04:14:43.08 --> 04:14:50.52
That's the other thing is recovering the, the, the, uh, the gap of insurance and all

4314
04:14:50.52 --> 04:14:51.52
that kind of stuff.

4315
04:14:51.52 --> 04:14:52.52
Right.

4316
04:14:52.52 --> 04:14:53.52
And I got one firefighter that's a builder.

4317
04:14:53.52 --> 04:14:57.44
It's going to help me have one guy who's said, I coach wrestling and he's a big builder.

4318
04:14:57.44 --> 04:15:04.48
He's going to help me, but, um, it's where do I feel comfortable in here?

4319
04:15:04.48 --> 04:15:05.48
Right.

4320
04:15:05.48 --> 04:15:09.36
I feel more comfortable with the, with the fire part is going to help me.

4321
04:15:09.36 --> 04:15:15.88
Nothing against the other guy, but, um, how do I feel in here?

4322
04:15:15.88 --> 04:15:16.88
Right.

4323
04:15:16.88 --> 04:15:19.64
So then that's going by, I don't know.

4324
04:15:19.64 --> 04:15:20.64
That's the challenge.

4325
04:15:20.64 --> 04:15:21.64
You know?

4326
04:15:21.64 --> 04:15:22.64
Yeah.

4327
04:15:22.64 --> 04:15:25.88
That's, uh, uh, definitely a devastating story.

4328
04:15:25.88 --> 04:15:28.24
Um, and like I said, I'm okay with it.

4329
04:15:28.24 --> 04:15:29.24
Yeah.

4330
04:15:29.24 --> 04:15:30.24
And that's the amazing thing.

4331
04:15:30.24 --> 04:15:31.24
I was going to say it's a devastating story.

4332
04:15:31.24 --> 04:15:35.36
And for you to be sitting here talking about it, like not quite with a shoulder shrug,

4333
04:15:35.36 --> 04:15:37.60
like almost with a shoulder shrug of like, Hey, guess what?

4334
04:15:37.60 --> 04:15:40.36
I got a better jacket out of the deal.

4335
04:15:40.36 --> 04:15:47.24
And, and Mama Lee, um, I always mentioned her charity, uh, America's mighty warriors.org.

4336
04:15:47.24 --> 04:15:48.24
We always mentioned that.

4337
04:15:48.24 --> 04:15:50.84
And the Navy seals fund.org.

4338
04:15:50.84 --> 04:15:53.84
That's another group that helps out my buddy, Drago.

4339
04:15:53.84 --> 04:15:54.84
That's, oh yeah.

4340
04:15:54.84 --> 04:15:55.84
Yeah.

4341
04:15:55.84 --> 04:15:56.84
Drago started that.

4342
04:15:56.84 --> 04:15:57.84
And his wife, Rachel.

4343
04:15:57.84 --> 04:15:58.84
Yep.

4344
04:15:58.84 --> 04:15:59.84
And she's a great friend of mine.

4345
04:15:59.84 --> 04:16:05.04
And, and just, and so, uh, anybody that wants to help out organizations that help

4346
04:16:05.04 --> 04:16:10.32
out, these are two organizations that Navy seals fund.org and America's mighty warriors.org.

4347
04:16:10.32 --> 04:16:12.88
Those are two awesome organizations.

4348
04:16:12.88 --> 04:16:14.92
Um, that help out.

4349
04:16:14.92 --> 04:16:19.56
This is one case of where, you know, a guy that didn't even ask for it, but somehow

4350
04:16:19.56 --> 04:16:20.56
they figured it out.

4351
04:16:20.56 --> 04:16:22.08
They figured me out.

4352
04:16:22.08 --> 04:16:26.72
It tracked me down, you know, I wonder, it's, it was wonderful.

4353
04:16:26.72 --> 04:16:31.000
Well, I think that probably gets us up to date of where we are now.

4354
04:16:31.000 --> 04:16:34.32
Um, Echo Charles, you got any questions?

4355
04:16:34.32 --> 04:16:35.32
Yeah.

4356
04:16:35.32 --> 04:16:36.32
What do you weigh now?

4357
04:16:36.32 --> 04:16:37.32
About 155.

4358
04:16:37.32 --> 04:16:38.32
There you go.

4359
04:16:38.32 --> 04:16:41.60
What's that, what's that workout program that you're, cause you're 75 years old and

4360
04:16:41.60 --> 04:16:44.96
it looks like if you wanted to step out on our wrestling match, you give some people

4361
04:16:44.96 --> 04:16:45.96
a run.

4362
04:16:45.96 --> 04:16:46.96
What's up?

4363
04:16:46.96 --> 04:16:48.84
What do you eat?

4364
04:16:48.84 --> 04:16:49.84
It's a Rolex watch.

4365
04:16:49.84 --> 04:16:50.84
What do you eat?

4366
04:16:50.84 --> 04:16:51.84
What do you eat?

4367
04:16:51.84 --> 04:16:58.44
Um, I'm going to just some protein, uh, do a little bit of stuff called a super pump.

4368
04:16:58.44 --> 04:17:02.84
Uh, this, this far supplements go, but I struggle to eat.

4369
04:17:02.84 --> 04:17:06.52
I, I hate eating man, but I eat fish and chicken.

4370
04:17:06.52 --> 04:17:07.52
Cool.

4371
04:17:07.52 --> 04:17:08.52
You know, what about them beans?

4372
04:17:08.52 --> 04:17:09.72
Your mom was pushing down your throat.

4373
04:17:09.72 --> 04:17:11.84
I'm done with beans.

4374
04:17:11.84 --> 04:17:18.44
I do like going to Bob's diner in Louisville and get myself a, um, that's my, that's my

4375
04:17:18.44 --> 04:17:19.44
little fix.

4376
04:17:19.44 --> 04:17:24.000
Uh, where was one Charles with chorizo and, and sometimes a bloody Mary.

4377
04:17:24.000 --> 04:17:27.68
What about, uh, what about your PT program that I work out every day?

4378
04:17:27.68 --> 04:17:28.68
What do you do?

4379
04:17:28.68 --> 04:17:29.68
Lifting, right?

4380
04:17:29.68 --> 04:17:31.08
Just, just in tries.

4381
04:17:31.08 --> 04:17:32.72
I do all the splits, old man splits.

4382
04:17:32.72 --> 04:17:37.04
Just tries back and by shoulders and traps, legs, something along those legs, legs, legs

4383
04:17:37.04 --> 04:17:38.04
front legs back.

4384
04:17:38.04 --> 04:17:43.56
I come in here, 75 man is like, oh, yeah, I do the front, front's in back, you know,

4385
04:17:43.56 --> 04:17:45.20
but I, but I do something every day.

4386
04:17:45.20 --> 04:17:48.76
My ankle hurts so badly that I don't do a lot of cardio.

4387
04:17:48.76 --> 04:17:53.68
If I do cardio, it's on the stir-stupper, take it up just one minute at one, one minute

4388
04:17:53.68 --> 04:17:59.40
at two, all the way up to 10, you know, and then back down and then that, that's pretty

4389
04:17:59.40 --> 04:18:00.40
much it.

4390
04:18:00.40 --> 04:18:07.28
I don't know, like I said, I think genetics, you know, my dad was, my dad was a drywaller,

4391
04:18:07.28 --> 04:18:08.28
man.

4392
04:18:08.28 --> 04:18:12.08
He did that stuff till he was 81 years old on the ladder, weren't on stilts with a cigarette

4393
04:18:12.08 --> 04:18:13.08
in his mouth.

4394
04:18:13.08 --> 04:18:15.56
I'm looking, I had firefighters who wouldn't do that.

4395
04:18:15.56 --> 04:18:18.36
You know, I'm like, are you nuts?

4396
04:18:18.36 --> 04:18:23.80
So then I had to move him in with me and I actually, um, Serena went to college at Colorado

4397
04:18:23.80 --> 04:18:28.84
State University in Pueblo and she watched him for three years, watching him do his,

4398
04:18:28.84 --> 04:18:31.000
he's amazing, man.

4399
04:18:31.000 --> 04:18:37.96
He, uh, gave me all that, uh, uh, love, I guess, you know.

4400
04:18:37.96 --> 04:18:38.96
Yeah.

4401
04:18:38.96 --> 04:18:44.12
Wasn't, it wasn't, you know, he wasn't afraid to share himself.

4402
04:18:44.12 --> 04:18:48.96
And I was coaching wrestling for, well, four years ago for four years.

4403
04:18:48.96 --> 04:18:52.32
The number one rule, don't hurt the coach.

4404
04:18:52.32 --> 04:18:57.56
I'd get in me wrestling and tussling if they got in somebody, okay.

4405
04:18:57.56 --> 04:18:58.56
Stop.

4406
04:18:58.56 --> 04:18:59.56
Don't hurt the coach.

4407
04:18:59.56 --> 04:19:04.08
You know, and I didn't realize my, my shoulder was so screwed up, you know.

4408
04:19:04.08 --> 04:19:07.04
And, uh, so I, at some point I needed a shoulder replacement.

4409
04:19:07.04 --> 04:19:09.24
Some point I need to do my ankle.

4410
04:19:09.24 --> 04:19:11.24
I'm trying to find this Navy dock.

4411
04:19:11.24 --> 04:19:16.48
If he ever gets the VA ever helps me do the community care to get that done.

4412
04:19:16.48 --> 04:19:24.08
But, um, no, it's my brother, five years old, man, had me doing stuff.

4413
04:19:24.08 --> 04:19:28.76
When I hit the teams climbing that rope or doing that stuff is like a piece of cake,

4414
04:19:28.76 --> 04:19:36.88
you know, and, uh, but it is, it is, it is that time that's mine.

4415
04:19:36.88 --> 04:19:42.32
You know, and I, and I do, and I do really look at it revealing the little boy, man.

4416
04:19:42.32 --> 04:19:46.72
You know, because I didn't, I was living myself with the outside warrior so much that I destroyed

4417
04:19:46.72 --> 04:19:51.52
so many relationships that I didn't have to destroy.

4418
04:19:51.52 --> 04:19:54.96
And, uh, and, and understanding that I am worth loving.

4419
04:19:54.96 --> 04:19:58.40
I'm where I am a good person, you know.

4420
04:19:58.40 --> 04:20:02.88
And, uh, but now it's where I met with the, I'm back into the nakedness again.

4421
04:20:02.88 --> 04:20:07.36
It's going to be interesting to see where I'm going, you know, as, as where my life's

4422
04:20:07.36 --> 04:20:08.36
at.

4423
04:20:08.36 --> 04:20:15.84
And, um, looking forward to an Oliver or chief Allen or my creator, right?

4424
04:20:15.84 --> 04:20:17.84
You know, I'm not pissed at him.

4425
04:20:17.84 --> 04:20:21.80
You know, all the, all the, all the, the only doing is saying, Hey, I want you and I'm

4426
04:20:21.80 --> 04:20:26.08
leading you here and, and, uh, keep yours open.

4427
04:20:26.08 --> 04:20:28.08
What's the instructor's pay attention.

4428
04:20:28.08 --> 04:20:29.08
Right.

4429
04:20:29.08 --> 04:20:31.48
I used to do that with my five right to pay attention.

4430
04:20:31.48 --> 04:20:35.56
I'd look at him sometime when this guy lieutenant, uh, was asking, he gives you a chief.

4431
04:20:35.56 --> 04:20:37.60
So yeah, he says, what'd you do to it?

4432
04:20:37.60 --> 04:20:38.60
His name.

4433
04:20:38.60 --> 04:20:39.60
I said, I didn't do anything to him.

4434
04:20:39.60 --> 04:20:40.60
What's up?

4435
04:20:40.60 --> 04:20:42.96
He said, well, I came over and says, I think the chief hates me.

4436
04:20:42.96 --> 04:20:44.20
He says, why is that?

4437
04:20:44.20 --> 04:20:50.24
Cause he just looked at me and I felt it.

4438
04:20:50.24 --> 04:20:51.96
And that comes from instructors, right?

4439
04:20:51.96 --> 04:20:53.48
It comes from the Oliver.

4440
04:20:53.48 --> 04:20:54.48
It comes from chief Allen.

4441
04:20:54.48 --> 04:21:02.08
It comes from instructor going, it just lives.

4442
04:21:02.08 --> 04:21:05.08
And he said, I just told him that's your face sometimes.

4443
04:21:05.08 --> 04:21:08.68
That's what you looked like.

4444
04:21:08.68 --> 04:21:12.92
Well, Gil, uh, any other closing thoughts?

4445
04:21:12.92 --> 04:21:15.96
No, I just want to thank you.

4446
04:21:15.96 --> 04:21:20.48
I appreciate the opportunity, uh, that, that I'm here.

4447
04:21:20.48 --> 04:21:22.44
I was pretty apprehensive about it.

4448
04:21:22.44 --> 04:21:32.36
I wasn't quite sure, but then it just, uh, um, I'm grateful to the creator that you're

4449
04:21:32.36 --> 04:21:34.92
here and that, that we're here together.

4450
04:21:34.92 --> 04:21:37.60
And I'm glad, I'm glad you made it through.

4451
04:21:37.60 --> 04:21:41.60
And just, I'm just prayer blessing on you.

4452
04:21:41.60 --> 04:21:44.72
Well, um, thank you.

4453
04:21:44.72 --> 04:21:45.72
Definitely appreciate it.

4454
04:21:45.72 --> 04:21:49.48
Um, definitely, you know, blessed to be here as we all are.

4455
04:21:49.48 --> 04:21:51.84
Um, and, and just thank you.

4456
04:21:51.84 --> 04:21:56.76
Thank you for, you know, thank you for laying that groundwork in the teams, the, the, the,

4457
04:21:56.76 --> 04:22:01.72
the groundwork that you guys that, that we built off of, that we tried to maintain the,

4458
04:22:01.72 --> 04:22:05.12
the reputation that you guys earned and we always did our best.

4459
04:22:05.12 --> 04:22:06.56
So thank you for doing that.

4460
04:22:06.56 --> 04:22:09.20
Thank you for your service in the Navy and the teams.

4461
04:22:09.20 --> 04:22:16.28
And of course 30, how many years as a firefighter, 37, 37 years as a firefighter.

4462
04:22:16.28 --> 04:22:22.60
Um, and just that, that level of service, uh, can't thank you enough.

4463
04:22:22.60 --> 04:22:23.60
Appreciate you coming.

4464
04:22:23.60 --> 04:22:24.60
Thank you.

4465
04:22:24.60 --> 04:22:25.60
Who, yeah.

4466
04:22:25.60 --> 04:22:27.32
Who, yeah.

4467
04:22:27.32 --> 04:22:35.98
And with that, Gil Espinosa has left the building and I think makes it pretty clear that getting

4468
04:22:35.98 --> 04:22:38.20
after it is a lifelong mission.

4469
04:22:38.20 --> 04:22:46.44
It's a lifelong mission and you know, it was very interesting and awesome to hear somebody

4470
04:22:46.44 --> 04:22:55.80
that's been doing all kinds of things, badass things from being a seal in Vietnam to being

4471
04:22:55.80 --> 04:23:02.04
a firefighter, to being a wrestler at a really high level.

4472
04:23:02.04 --> 04:23:05.44
And he's 75 years old and he's like, I'm still trying to figure it out.

4473
04:23:05.44 --> 04:23:07.68
So pretty awesome.

4474
04:23:07.68 --> 04:23:08.68
Oh yeah.

4475
04:23:08.68 --> 04:23:14.24
The parts that stood out to me, which was funny is the black mac and pink mac.

4476
04:23:14.24 --> 04:23:15.24
Oh yeah.

4477
04:23:15.24 --> 04:23:16.24
And you're like, why do you call him black?

4478
04:23:16.24 --> 04:23:18.84
I was like, bro, I know exactly why.

4479
04:23:18.84 --> 04:23:19.84
Cause he's black.

4480
04:23:19.84 --> 04:23:20.84
Yeah.

4481
04:23:20.84 --> 04:23:21.84
So interesting.

4482
04:23:21.84 --> 04:23:23.92
Well, you take that.

4483
04:23:23.92 --> 04:23:29.20
That is the, that is the, uh, assumption and it's a, it's a correct assumption to make.

4484
04:23:29.20 --> 04:23:35.32
Oh, in seeing the teams, whatever, whatever, like if you're a Mexican, you're going to

4485
04:23:35.32 --> 04:23:36.72
have some kind of Mexican nickname.

4486
04:23:36.72 --> 04:23:41.12
If you're black, not guaranteed, but most likely you're going to have some kind of something

4487
04:23:41.12 --> 04:23:43.36
that has to do with your ethnicity.

4488
04:23:43.36 --> 04:23:44.36
Yeah.

4489
04:23:44.36 --> 04:23:45.36
Makes sense.

4490
04:23:45.36 --> 04:23:49.88
Because it's like, that's just, that's just how, that's just how, uh, well, in Hawaii,

4491
04:23:49.88 --> 04:23:55.28
I told you this before, in Hawaii race, racial issues is not a thing, not a big deal at all.

4492
04:23:55.28 --> 04:23:58.40
Everybody's mixed and there's so, and there's so many races or whatever.

4493
04:23:58.40 --> 04:24:04.12
So to say, Oh, the Filipino guy, Oh, the black guy or popolo guy, you say popolo for black

4494
04:24:04.12 --> 04:24:06.80
guy or the holy guy or the Japanese guy or whatever.

4495
04:24:06.80 --> 04:24:07.80
Like that's not a thing.

4496
04:24:07.80 --> 04:24:09.68
No one's like, Oh, that's racial or nothing.

4497
04:24:09.68 --> 04:24:15.36
There's no racial sensitivity in Hawaii cause everybody's something.

4498
04:24:15.36 --> 04:24:19.12
Um, so I get it.

4499
04:24:19.12 --> 04:24:24.24
But so I get that, that kind of like, where if that's funny that they called pink Mac

4500
04:24:24.24 --> 04:24:28.56
because he's, because like I said, no, he's a black guy.

4501
04:24:28.56 --> 04:24:29.56
I'm telling you, bro.

4502
04:24:29.56 --> 04:24:31.92
He didn't, he did not look black.

4503
04:24:31.92 --> 04:24:34.08
You know, he might've had a black mom, but he didn't look black.

4504
04:24:34.08 --> 04:24:36.24
And he's from the island.

4505
04:24:36.24 --> 04:24:42.24
So he seemed like a howly guy that just, you know, he had kind of freckles.

4506
04:24:42.24 --> 04:24:43.24
Hit soul.

4507
04:24:43.24 --> 04:24:44.24
Yeah.

4508
04:24:44.24 --> 04:24:45.24
Yeah.

4509
04:24:45.24 --> 04:24:46.24
Soul is a soul man.

4510
04:24:46.24 --> 04:24:47.24
But that's a thing too though.

4511
04:24:47.24 --> 04:24:50.96
If you're like, if you're hoppa like that and you're half black and you just pull the

4512
04:24:50.96 --> 04:24:53.44
white side, a lot of times you wind up with freckles.

4513
04:24:53.44 --> 04:24:54.44
Oh yeah.

4514
04:24:54.44 --> 04:24:59.52
There's this guy, one of my friends from college, Gerald Lacey white guy, howly guy, half black.

4515
04:24:59.52 --> 04:25:01.000
His older brother's like dark skin.

4516
04:25:01.000 --> 04:25:02.000
He's like a white dude.

4517
04:25:02.000 --> 04:25:07.000
He didn't talk like white, he's from Crenshaw, but to look at him, you're like, and he had

4518
04:25:07.000 --> 04:25:08.000
freckles.

4519
04:25:08.000 --> 04:25:14.04
They call him, I think my dad, he's always say this, call us red bone when you're real,

4520
04:25:14.04 --> 04:25:17.68
real light skin black person, red bone for Elra.

4521
04:25:17.68 --> 04:25:21.76
Um, so also a case for the black thing and white thing.

4522
04:25:21.76 --> 04:25:25.60
So my brother Jade's nickname when he was young was snake.

4523
04:25:25.60 --> 04:25:26.60
Right.

4524
04:25:26.60 --> 04:25:27.60
And there's a guy in the team.

4525
04:25:27.60 --> 04:25:29.20
So you know, I don't, I think he's still in.

4526
04:25:29.20 --> 04:25:34.92
So I don't say his name, but his name is snake too, cause he has a lisp and he's a twin too,

4527
04:25:34.92 --> 04:25:35.92
by the way.

4528
04:25:35.92 --> 04:25:40.32
But so when we moved here, uh, so Jeremy, my friend Jeremy, he'd always tease Jade,

4529
04:25:40.32 --> 04:25:42.96
call him snake cause that's his little nickname from it.

4530
04:25:42.96 --> 04:25:46.000
You know, when you're a little kid, you come to tease him.

4531
04:25:46.000 --> 04:25:48.24
So when we moved here, we met snake.

4532
04:25:48.24 --> 04:25:51.08
He's a white guy blonde hair blue eye dude.

4533
04:25:51.08 --> 04:25:55.64
So but there's Jade was black, half black.

4534
04:25:55.64 --> 04:25:57.72
Then there's snake who's white.

4535
04:25:57.72 --> 04:25:59.52
So Jade was black snake.

4536
04:25:59.52 --> 04:26:01.72
This guy was white snake.

4537
04:26:01.72 --> 04:26:02.72
Same exact thing.

4538
04:26:02.72 --> 04:26:03.92
So I understood exactly what he was.

4539
04:26:03.92 --> 04:26:04.92
This guy's black mac.

4540
04:26:04.92 --> 04:26:05.92
This guy's pink.

4541
04:26:05.92 --> 04:26:06.92
That's another level.

4542
04:26:06.92 --> 04:26:07.92
It was kind of funny.

4543
04:26:07.92 --> 04:26:08.92
So I dug it.

4544
04:26:08.92 --> 04:26:09.92
I mean, I understood.

4545
04:26:09.92 --> 04:26:10.92
Yeah.

4546
04:26:10.92 --> 04:26:11.92
Yeah.

4547
04:26:11.92 --> 04:26:12.92
I mean, it was, it wasn't like I was surprised.

4548
04:26:12.92 --> 04:26:13.92
He's like, oh, he's black.

4549
04:26:13.92 --> 04:26:14.92
I was like, okay.

4550
04:26:14.92 --> 04:26:15.92
Well, yeah.

4551
04:26:15.92 --> 04:26:16.92
Obviously.

4552
04:26:16.92 --> 04:26:20.48
But it could have also been like some random story about, you know, we called him black

4553
04:26:20.48 --> 04:26:24.56
mac because he, you know, he got gunpowder on the blah, blah, blah.

4554
04:26:24.56 --> 04:26:25.56
You know, just whatever.

4555
04:26:25.56 --> 04:26:26.92
But, but it's a good nickname.

4556
04:26:26.92 --> 04:26:30.16
So I figured we had to get to the bottom of that one.

4557
04:26:30.16 --> 04:26:35.64
But anyways, what an awesome opportunity to hear from a guy that's been through all kinds

4558
04:26:35.64 --> 04:26:39.40
of stuff and, and is still out there trying to learn.

4559
04:26:39.40 --> 04:26:40.40
So stay inactive.

4560
04:26:40.40 --> 04:26:41.40
That's for sure.

4561
04:26:41.40 --> 04:26:42.40
Yeah.

4562
04:26:42.40 --> 04:26:43.40
Yeah.

4563
04:26:43.40 --> 04:26:44.40
For sure.

4564
04:26:44.40 --> 04:26:45.40
Yeah.

4565
04:26:45.40 --> 04:26:46.40
He's like saying, oh yeah, my shoulders like jam.

4566
04:26:46.40 --> 04:26:50.56
But when you look at a 75 years old, when you look at me like, bro, this guy's like,

4567
04:26:50.56 --> 04:26:53.48
he looks, how old does he, how does he look?

4568
04:26:53.48 --> 04:26:59.000
If he said he was sick, if he said it was 55, I wouldn't be like, oh, I'd be okay.

4569
04:26:59.000 --> 04:27:00.000
Cool.

4570
04:27:00.000 --> 04:27:01.000
55.

4571
04:27:01.000 --> 04:27:02.52
You know, you look like you're aging a little bit.

4572
04:27:02.52 --> 04:27:03.52
Yeah.

4573
04:27:03.52 --> 04:27:04.52
Yeah.

4574
04:27:04.52 --> 04:27:06.52
You look like you've been rode pretty hard, but at 55, you're still doing pretty good.

4575
04:27:06.52 --> 04:27:07.52
No, I would say.

4576
04:27:07.52 --> 04:27:08.52
But then he's like, no, I'm 75.

4577
04:27:08.52 --> 04:27:11.20
No, I would look at his body and be like, oh, you're 55.

4578
04:27:11.20 --> 04:27:12.36
Dang, you're still getting after it.

4579
04:27:12.36 --> 04:27:13.36
Yeah.

4580
04:27:13.36 --> 04:27:14.36
Yeah.

4581
04:27:14.36 --> 04:27:15.36
For sure.

4582
04:27:15.36 --> 04:27:16.36
Obviously.

4583
04:27:16.36 --> 04:27:17.36
For sure.

4584
04:27:17.36 --> 04:27:18.36
That's literally what he looks like.

4585
04:27:18.36 --> 04:27:19.36
Yeah.

4586
04:27:19.36 --> 04:27:20.36
Impressive.

4587
04:27:20.36 --> 04:27:21.36
Hey, it pays, man.

4588
04:27:21.36 --> 04:27:22.36
Stay active.

4589
04:27:22.36 --> 04:27:23.36
You know, stay in the game.

4590
04:27:23.36 --> 04:27:24.36
You know what I'm saying?

4591
04:27:24.36 --> 04:27:25.36
Yeah.

4592
04:27:25.36 --> 04:27:26.96
You're not like taking it for granted.

4593
04:27:26.96 --> 04:27:27.96
Yeah.

4594
04:27:27.96 --> 04:27:28.96
Yeah.

4595
04:27:28.96 --> 04:27:33.44
You know, when mentally you stay in the game, who is one of the, I think this guy, Tom,

4596
04:27:33.44 --> 04:27:35.36
he's a wrestler here.

4597
04:27:35.36 --> 04:27:36.36
He trains here.

4598
04:27:36.36 --> 04:27:39.76
He used to, anyway, he said something really important where he was like, yeah, my dad,

4599
04:27:39.76 --> 04:27:45.36
he would like, he said there was something along the lines of, uh, don't give yourself

4600
04:27:45.36 --> 04:27:48.80
like the excuse of age to start going less hard or whatever.

4601
04:27:48.80 --> 04:27:50.72
Hey, look, if you can't go hard, you can't go hard.

4602
04:27:50.72 --> 04:27:51.72
Yeah.

4603
04:27:51.72 --> 04:27:55.32
If you're max or whatever and you can't get it, then okay, you can't get it.

4604
04:27:55.32 --> 04:28:00.60
But don't be like, Hey, you know, I'm 70 now or probably a lot of time it starts younger.

4605
04:28:00.60 --> 04:28:02.56
So Hey, I'm 40 now.

4606
04:28:02.56 --> 04:28:09.32
So I'm going to, instead of getting this hard set of 10 with, you know, 100 pounds or whatever,

4607
04:28:09.32 --> 04:28:13.72
dumbbells, I'm going to do like 80s.

4608
04:28:13.72 --> 04:28:16.60
Seems like just because I'm getting older now, kind of a thing.

4609
04:28:16.60 --> 04:28:18.80
And look, I'm not saying go crazy and be dangerous.

4610
04:28:18.80 --> 04:28:19.80
I'm not saying that.

4611
04:28:19.80 --> 04:28:22.000
I'm not saying that I'm going to get a mindset of like, Hey, I'm going to cut, I'm going

4612
04:28:22.000 --> 04:28:25.44
to cut myself some slack because I'm getting older.

4613
04:28:25.44 --> 04:28:31.68
Just in general is not that good of an idea where it seems like, like he wasn't, you know,

4614
04:28:31.68 --> 04:28:33.20
Gil like didn't do that.

4615
04:28:33.20 --> 04:28:34.20
No, he's like straight.

4616
04:28:34.20 --> 04:28:35.20
Yeah.

4617
04:28:35.20 --> 04:28:36.20
Oh yeah.

4618
04:28:36.20 --> 04:28:37.20
No slack.

4619
04:28:37.20 --> 04:28:38.20
He's like 75.

4620
04:28:38.20 --> 04:28:39.48
He's like, you know, I'm really looking forward to like, you know, really developing and,

4621
04:28:39.48 --> 04:28:49.40
you know, like, most people 75, bro, that's like, you know, you can just tell by them

4622
04:28:49.40 --> 04:28:51.76
that he has that mindset, you know, and it shows.

4623
04:28:51.76 --> 04:28:52.76
Right.

4624
04:28:52.76 --> 04:28:53.76
Awesome.

4625
04:28:53.76 --> 04:28:57.88
Well, speaking of staying in the game, you got to stay in the game, get yourself some

4626
04:28:57.88 --> 04:29:01.32
jockel fuel to stay in the game, get yourself some joint warfare.

4627
04:29:01.32 --> 04:29:02.68
That's the thing that's going to keep you in the game.

4628
04:29:02.68 --> 04:29:03.76
Well, let me rephrase that.

4629
04:29:03.76 --> 04:29:07.52
That's the thing that's going to knock you out of the game is when the joints break down.

4630
04:29:07.52 --> 04:29:10.80
When the joints break down, we break down.

4631
04:29:10.80 --> 04:29:12.28
The machine breaks down.

4632
04:29:12.28 --> 04:29:16.44
So you got to be careful of that one.

4633
04:29:16.44 --> 04:29:21.12
You can get it there, you can get it at Wawa.

4634
04:29:21.12 --> 04:29:22.12
You can get vitamin shop.

4635
04:29:22.12 --> 04:29:23.12
You can get everything at a vitamin shop.

4636
04:29:23.12 --> 04:29:29.24
You can get the military commissaries, Hanifords, dash stores up in Maryland, Wake Fern and

4637
04:29:29.24 --> 04:29:34.04
shop right, Circle K in Florida, H E B in Tejas.

4638
04:29:34.04 --> 04:29:37.28
Murphy's down the Southeast and Meyer in the Midwest.

4639
04:29:37.28 --> 04:29:41.56
That's where you can get this fuel for you.

4640
04:29:41.56 --> 04:29:42.84
That's good for you.

4641
04:29:42.84 --> 04:29:44.72
That's the key component.

4642
04:29:44.72 --> 04:29:46.36
So there you go.

4643
04:29:46.36 --> 04:29:50.72
Also, wrestling, he was coaching wrestling for four years.

4644
04:29:50.72 --> 04:29:51.72
That's going to keep you in the game.

4645
04:29:51.72 --> 04:29:54.36
Jiu-Jitsu is going to keep you in the game.

4646
04:29:54.36 --> 04:29:55.76
So you should train Jiu-Jitsu.

4647
04:29:55.76 --> 04:29:58.16
When you train Jiu-Jitsu, you're going to need some gear to train Jiu-Jitsu and you're

4648
04:29:58.16 --> 04:30:04.16
going to need a gear, rash guards, shorts, originUSA.com.

4649
04:30:04.16 --> 04:30:05.64
OriginUSA.com.

4650
04:30:05.64 --> 04:30:07.80
Go there, get whatever you need.

4651
04:30:07.80 --> 04:30:11.12
Get hunt gear, get jeans.

4652
04:30:11.12 --> 04:30:13.96
We got to talk about the Delta 68.

4653
04:30:13.96 --> 04:30:14.96
The funny thing.

4654
04:30:14.96 --> 04:30:15.96
So here's the thing.

4655
04:30:15.96 --> 04:30:21.12
We didn't wear those because they were, he said there's no operational purpose.

4656
04:30:21.12 --> 04:30:22.88
And I was like, oh, just to be cool.

4657
04:30:22.88 --> 04:30:24.04
It wasn't even to be cool there.

4658
04:30:24.04 --> 04:30:26.000
It was to be cool back in America.

4659
04:30:26.000 --> 04:30:27.000
Right.

4660
04:30:27.000 --> 04:30:29.000
Now, I'm going to say this.

4661
04:30:29.000 --> 04:30:32.60
I'm going to make this statement.

4662
04:30:32.60 --> 04:30:39.40
If they would have had Delta 68s that we make, they would have preferred to wear those 100%

4663
04:30:39.40 --> 04:30:41.24
because they're light.

4664
04:30:41.24 --> 04:30:43.16
They got a little bit of stretch.

4665
04:30:43.16 --> 04:30:48.96
Some of the fatigue don't stretch, like fatigue jungle camis, they don't stretch at all.

4666
04:30:48.96 --> 04:30:51.68
Delta 68s got that little bit of give you a little leeway.

4667
04:30:51.68 --> 04:30:54.16
It's not even a little, it's all the leeway that you need to move.

4668
04:30:54.16 --> 04:30:55.48
You want to do a squat, you can do it.

4669
04:30:55.48 --> 04:30:58.48
You want to do a front kick, you can do it.

4670
04:30:58.48 --> 04:31:02.84
So the Delta 68s re-engineered.

4671
04:31:02.84 --> 04:31:07.80
If we could get time travel, we go back in time and just drop off SEAL Team 1, SEAL Team

4672
04:31:07.80 --> 04:31:09.56
2, they're out there in the Delta.

4673
04:31:09.56 --> 04:31:11.32
Give them some Delta 68s.

4674
04:31:11.32 --> 04:31:13.12
Here you go, boys.

4675
04:31:13.12 --> 04:31:15.48
So let freedom ride.

4676
04:31:15.48 --> 04:31:22.64
Wait, so just to clarify, and this was one of the cooler things that I've heard too.

4677
04:31:22.64 --> 04:31:23.64
One of many.

4678
04:31:23.64 --> 04:31:24.84
Small, but very cool.

4679
04:31:24.84 --> 04:31:30.60
So he was saying, you wear them in combat just so they're almost like got their street

4680
04:31:30.60 --> 04:31:34.48
cred when you come back, where it's like these jeans are the ones that I wore.

4681
04:31:34.48 --> 04:31:38.000
It's not like you can wear your helmet or your night vision goggles.

4682
04:31:38.000 --> 04:31:40.60
I'm just saying, and be like, yeah, these are the ones that are probably why you're

4683
04:31:40.60 --> 04:31:41.88
going to wear that, but jeans you can't.

4684
04:31:41.88 --> 04:31:45.92
Have you seen pictures with guys that are carrying flags rolled up on their gear?

4685
04:31:45.92 --> 04:31:49.80
They'll carry an American flag on their gear, like a full American flag.

4686
04:31:49.80 --> 04:31:50.80
It's the same kind of thing.

4687
04:31:50.80 --> 04:31:53.24
It's like, hey, this has been on ops with me.

4688
04:31:53.24 --> 04:31:57.12
I have the little American flag on my body armor.

4689
04:31:57.12 --> 04:32:02.04
That's my favorite flag, little American flag that went out on ops with me.

4690
04:32:02.04 --> 04:32:03.04
That's what it did.

4691
04:32:03.04 --> 04:32:07.56
So let me ask you this, and maybe I'm out of touch, but so you know how they would wear

4692
04:32:07.56 --> 04:32:09.52
jeans.

4693
04:32:09.52 --> 04:32:10.92
Is that even possible now?

4694
04:32:10.92 --> 04:32:13.44
Yeah, you could ever go on like a, oh, for real?

4695
04:32:13.44 --> 04:32:14.44
Yeah.

4696
04:32:14.44 --> 04:32:15.44
You can wear Delta 68s all day.

4697
04:32:15.44 --> 04:32:16.44
Oh, damn.

4698
04:32:16.44 --> 04:32:19.60
Like on a real world op mission, whatever.

4699
04:32:19.60 --> 04:32:20.60
Damn.

4700
04:32:20.60 --> 04:32:21.60
Okay.

4701
04:32:21.60 --> 04:32:22.60
I mean, sometimes you wear civilian clothes on missions.

4702
04:32:22.60 --> 04:32:23.60
I've done it.

4703
04:32:23.60 --> 04:32:25.84
You know, you're going out.

4704
04:32:25.84 --> 04:32:26.84
Low visibility operations.

4705
04:32:26.84 --> 04:32:28.84
You know what I'm saying?

4706
04:32:28.84 --> 04:32:29.84
Yeah.

4707
04:32:29.84 --> 04:32:30.84
Yeah.

4708
04:32:30.84 --> 04:32:32.48
And if you really, I mean, if you really wanted to, you could wear them.

4709
04:32:32.48 --> 04:32:34.40
In the SEAL teams, you can get away with a lot.

4710
04:32:34.40 --> 04:32:39.56
Now, look, if you're in Ramadi and you start mixing match and uniforms in 2006 and somebody

4711
04:32:39.56 --> 04:32:43.16
sees you and you don't look like an American, that's not a good call.

4712
04:32:43.16 --> 04:32:48.84
You want to look like an American soldier or Marine 100%.

4713
04:32:48.84 --> 04:32:50.12
So yeah, there you go.

4714
04:32:50.12 --> 04:32:51.12

4740
04:33:42.64 --> 04:33:46.64
Hey, the beginning today, I read from by water beneath the walls.

4741
04:33:46.64 --> 04:33:49.24
I was just at the SEAL Team 1 reunion.

4742
04:33:49.24 --> 04:33:50.24
I'm with guys.

4743
04:33:50.24 --> 04:33:56.48
I'm with plank owners, meaning I'm with guys at the SEAL Team 1 reunion that were the first

4744
04:33:56.48 --> 04:33:57.76
guys.

4745
04:33:57.76 --> 04:33:59.88
They were there when SEAL Team 1 started.

4746
04:33:59.88 --> 04:34:01.28
They were there.

4747
04:34:01.28 --> 04:34:05.72
And these Vietnam guys were, we were talking about this book and guys were like, oh, there's

4748
04:34:05.72 --> 04:34:07.84
so much information that I didn't even know.

4749
04:34:07.84 --> 04:34:09.36
That started SEAL Team 1.

4750
04:34:09.36 --> 04:34:10.84
We're like, I learned.

4751
04:34:10.84 --> 04:34:15.20

And then, of course, Only Cry for the Living by Holly McKay.

4755

04:35:20.32 --> 04:35:27.64
So those are some good charities if you want to help the people that help us.

4776
04:35:27.64 --> 04:35:35.000
And also, if you want to hang out with Echo and I on Twitter, on the gram, on Facebook,

4777
04:35:35.000 --> 04:35:36.000
Twitter's reignited.

4778
04:35:36.000 --> 04:35:38.72
There's lots of people jumping on Twitter right now.

4779
04:35:38.72 --> 04:35:39.72
Some people are leaving.

4780
04:35:39.72 --> 04:35:40.84
I don't know what's happening.

4781
04:35:40.84 --> 04:35:41.84
I've been there.

4782
04:35:41.84 --> 04:35:42.92
I'm still there.

4783
04:35:42.92 --> 04:35:44.36
We'll see where it goes.

4784
04:35:44.36 --> 04:35:47.52
But no matter where you are on the social media world, watch out for that algorithm because

4785
04:35:47.52 --> 04:35:49.64
it'll sneak up and grab you by the trope.

4786
04:35:49.64 --> 04:35:53.24
And you're not gonna like that.

4787
04:35:53.24 --> 04:35:56.68
So that's that.

4788
04:35:56.68 --> 04:35:57.68
One more.

4789
04:35:57.68 --> 04:36:00.000
Thank you to Gil Espinoza for joining us today.

4790
04:36:00.000 --> 04:36:07.24
Thank you, Gil, for your life of service to the navy, to the teams, and to the fire department.

4791
04:36:07.24 --> 04:36:09.32
We all thank you for that.

4792
04:36:09.32 --> 04:36:12.28
And thanks to all the firefighters out there.

4793
04:36:12.28 --> 04:36:18.40
All the firefighters out there on call, keeping us safe, ready to sacrifice your safety, ready

4794
04:36:18.40 --> 04:36:21.84
to sacrifice your life for us and our families.

4795
04:36:21.84 --> 04:36:23.88
Thank you to all the firefighters out there.

4796
04:36:23.88 --> 04:36:29.44
And the same goes to our EMTs, paramedics, and of course, police, law enforcement, dispatchers,

4797
04:36:29.44 --> 04:36:32.68
correctional officers, board of patrol, secret service, all first responders.

4798
04:36:32.68 --> 04:36:41.38
Thank you for keeping us safe on the home front and by with certainty.

4799
04:36:41.38 --> 04:36:47.08
Thank you to the folks in military uniform who go out protect freedom and liberty around

4800
04:36:47.08 --> 04:36:48.16
the world.

4801
04:36:48.16 --> 04:36:53.68
We are eternally grateful for the protection that you provide us and everyone else out

4802
04:36:53.68 --> 04:36:54.68
there.

4803
04:36:54.68 --> 04:37:02.04
Like Gil learned during basic seal training all those years ago.

4804
04:37:02.04 --> 04:37:06.96
You can't change the water temperature of the ocean.

4805
04:37:06.96 --> 04:37:09.24
It's going to be what it's going to be.

4806
04:37:09.24 --> 04:37:10.40
So don't complain.

4807
04:37:10.40 --> 04:37:11.40
Don't whine.

4808
04:37:11.40 --> 04:37:13.88
Don't grumble.

4809
04:37:13.88 --> 04:37:18.72
Instead, just go and get after it.

4810
04:37:18.72 --> 04:37:24.32
And until next time, this is Echo and Jaco out.
