00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is Jocco podcast number 158.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
With echo Charles and me, Jocco-Willink.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Good evening, Echo. Good evening.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
There was blood all over the floor and smoke in the air.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I heard shots fired outside, but I wasn't quite sure who was shooting or what they were shooting at.

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I moved down the hallway, confirming that all the rooms had been cleared.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I soon found the source of the blood.

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I wounded Iraqi civilian on whom I sealed hospital corpsmen.

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
A highly trained combat medic was working to apply medical care.

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And that's just a short little opening from Chapter 2 of the Book of the Decodomy Leadership

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
with that I wrote with my brother, Lave Babin.

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And in that chapter, I go on to explain how during this operation in Fulusia, Iraq,

13
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we went on to detain multiple suspected terrorists that night.

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And I don't go into much detail about that.

15
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And I don't talk about the people that we captured.

16
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I think we took, I think we took about 13 people off target military-aged males.

17
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We were probably looking for two or three. We weren't couldn't figure out or confirm who they were.

18
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So we brought all the military-aged males off target.

19
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And so we ended up at this detention facility and we're turning these individuals over.

20
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And I'm sitting there kind of just looking at them,

21
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
sizing them up.

22
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
This is one of the earliest operations I had done in my life.

23
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It was the first big operation I did in Iraq.

24
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And so I'm sort of curious, I guess, for lack of a better word.

25
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And I'm looking at the people that we had captured, like I said, I think there's 13 of them.

26
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And just looking at them, looking at their emotions that they were going through.

27
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And some of them look scared, right?

28
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
In fact, I would say the majority of them just look scared.

29
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Just, this is not good.

30
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And this is a bad situation.

31
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And you get that feeling like, okay, this guy's probably not bad.

32
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And we'll be released.

33
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Some of the guys look mad, which is understandable too.

34
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
You know, someone comes in there, your house in the little night and it takes you.

35
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And you can be mad about that.

36
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
If you can overcome the scared part, right?

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And of course, these people lived under Saddam Hussein.

38
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So they'd been through some brutal stuff.

39
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And for them to be not afraid, was also an understandable thing.

40
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Some of the older gentlemen.

41
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And then there was one guy, though, that he looked different.

42
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Look, the look in his eyes.

43
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It definitely wasn't scared.

44
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
But it wasn't even mad.

45
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
It was like beyond mad.

46
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
It was beyond angry.

47
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It was beyond a fanatical look.

48
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The look that he had in his eyes was evil.

49
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Look like an evil.

50
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
We could see evil there.

51
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And I never will forget that face.

52
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And I would see that type of face again over the years.

53
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Now, especially in Iraq, you go out and capture someone that was known for doing horrible things.

54
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And you could tell, you can grab five or six people.

55
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And you'd say, oh, let me guess which one is the bad guy?

56
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And usually wasn't very hard to tell.

57
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And then occasionally, some of those bad guys would just look.

58
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
They looked completely evil.

59
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
They looked like sadists.

60
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
They looked like murderers.

61
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
They had the face of evil.

62
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
You could see it in their eyes.

63
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And I was watching a video recently of a.

64
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:08.000
A young, beautiful young girl, blonde hair, kind of unkempt blonde hair, a little bit wild.

65
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And she had a like a constant persistent smile sort of shining on her face.

66
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.000
She had young little innocent eyes that were filled with hope.

67
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And I watched this video.

68
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And she says in the video, she says, my name is Louise.

69
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I'm a young lady from Denmark.

70
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And I have a burning desire to go out into the Arctic.

71
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And she's going on kind of describing herself.

72
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
She says, I'm very enthusiastic about the outdoors and outdoor activities.

73
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I'm studying the outdoor life in Norway for the same reason.

74
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I'm trying to find my dream.

75
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
She says, to go into the Arctic.

76
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But sometimes I take some detours before I end up where I want.

77
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And then the video she's got clips of her in various parts of the world on beaches and in jungles.

78
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And she's clearly a traveler.

79
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And then she says, but I'm still working my way towards the north.

80
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
A dream that has been stuck in my head.

81
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And I hope wish and pray that I can retrieve my dream.

82
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
A dream of experiencing the feeling of kicking a dog sled through the big Arctic.

83
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
About feeling the ice crystals in my face.

84
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And the view of an infinite white landscape.

85
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I dream about learning and experiencing the magnificent, untamed Arctic.

86
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And the video ends with her picking up snow in her hands and she blows it innocently into the camera lens and she's laughing.

87
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And the video fades.

88
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
But she was not able to fulfill her dream.

89
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:40.000
In fact, she entered a nightmare and didn't return on December 17th, 2018.

90
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:56.000
That girl who made that video, her name was Louise Jessperson, and her friend, Marin Euland, another beautiful young lady from Norway.

91
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:09.000
They were both brutally murdered by a group of subhuman savages.

92
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
As they camped beside a hiking trail in Morocco.

93
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And these despicable and violent people.

94
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And I use that term loosely. These savages that murdered these two girls actually recorded their disgusting acts and posted them online.

95
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:47.000
They attacked these girls. They saw through their throats with butcher knives.

96
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
While they were still alive.

97
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
While they were screaming.

98
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
While they were gasping for air.

99
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
While they were begging for mercy.

100
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:07.000
They were eventually gurgling in their own blood.

101
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And then fell silent.

102
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And one of the murderers put his foot on one of the girl's heads to hold her neck in place while he finished the job of decadating her.

103
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And these subhumans pledged their allegiance to ISIS.

104
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And shouted, it's Allah's will as they killed these innocent girls.

105
00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Sick, depraved, vile creatures.

106
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Evil.

107
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Evil does exist.

108
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Here's another example of evil.

109
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.000
I started doing time when I was 11 years old and I've been doing practically nothing else since then.

110
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
What time I haven't been in jail, I've spent either getting out or getting in again.

111
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I have no desire or whatever to reform myself.

112
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
My only desire is to reform people who try to reform me.

113
00:09:51.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And I believe the only way to reform people is to kill them.

114
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
In my lifetime, I have murdered 21 human beings.

115
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I have committed thousands of burglaries, robberies, larsons, and larsons.

116
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And last but not least, I have committed sautami on more than 1,000 male human beings.

117
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000
For all of these things, I am not the least bit sorry.

118
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I have no conscience, so that doesn't worry me.

119
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
I don't believe in man, God nor devil.

120
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I hate the whole damn human race, including myself.

121
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I pray to upon the weak, the harmless, and the unsuspecting.

122
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:59.000
This lesson I was taught by others might make right.

123
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Carl Pan's RAM, number 31614.

124
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And that is the opening of a book called Pan's RAM,

125
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Journal of a Murderer.

126
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Carl Pan's RAM was evil.

127
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
He was institutionalized for most of his life into tangent centers and prisons.

128
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And whatever may have been good about him at one time, or another, was eventually suffocated.

129
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Then what was left was pure, unmitigated hatred and malevolence.

130
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And while he was going through one of his final stints in prison, he made friends with a young prison guard by the name of Henry Lesser.

131
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And Henry Lesser seemed like a very good, positive person.

132
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Kind of had the ideal of reform.

133
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Now people could be helped, then his mind, and Henry asked that Pan's RAM, right, the story of his life, which Pan's RAM did.

134
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And the notes were saved, saved, and documented, and there was additional information from various supporting sources surrounding other details of Pan's RAM's life.

135
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And all that was put together and turned into this book.

136
00:12:39.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Which, though it is a very difficult read, it's, in my opinion, worth reading together a better understanding of, of human nature, and specifically of the capacity for men to commit evil.

137
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:18.000
So again, most of this that I'm going to read from the book is his writing, Karl Pan's RAM's writing.

138
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And here we go back to the book.

139
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
I was born June 28th, 1891 on a small farm in Minnesota.

140
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
My parents were of German descent, hardworking, ignorant, and poor.

141
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:37.000
The rest of the family consisted of five brothers and one sister, all of whom are dead except three of us brothers and our sister.

142
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:47.000
All of my family are as the average human beings are, they're honest and hardworking people, all except myself.

143
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I've been a human animal ever since I was born.

144
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:59.000
When I was very young at five or six years of age, I was a thief and a liar, and the older I got, the meaner I got.

145
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
As fast as the older boys grew up, they also pulled out one died.

146
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
They left me, my sister, one older brother and my mother.

147
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:19.000
My sister and I were sent to school during the days, and as soon as we came home in the evenings, we were put to work in the fields where my older brother and my mother were always at work from daylight until long after dark sometimes.

148
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:35.000
My portion of pay consisted of plenty of work and a sound beating every time I looked cock-eyed or done anything that displeased anyone who was older and stronger and capable to catch me and kick me around whenever they felt like it.

149
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And it seemed to me and still does now that everything was always right for the one who was the strongest and every single thing that I done was wrong.

150
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
So anyway, but right or wrong I used to get plenty of abuse.

151
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Everybody thought it was all right to deceive me, lie to me, and kick me around whenever they felt like it, and they felt like it pretty regular.

152
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
That is the way my life was lived until I was about 11 years old.

153
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:09.000
At about that time I began to suspect that there was something wrong about the treatment I was getting from the rest of the human race.

154
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:17.000
When I was about 11 years old I began to hear and see that there were other places in this world besides my own little corner of it.

155
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I began to realize that there were other people who lived nice, easy lives and who were not kicked around and worked to death.

156
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I decided that I wanted to leave my miserable home.

157
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Before I left I looked around and figured that one of our neighbors who was rich and had a nice home full of nice things had he had too much and I had too little.

158
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000
So one night I broke into his home and stole everything to that to my eyes had the most value.

159
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Those things were some apples, some cake, and a great big pistol.

160
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Eating the apples and cake and carrying the pistol under my coat I walked to the railroad yards where I caught a freight train going to the west where I intended to be a cowboy and shoot Indians.

161
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
But I must have had my wires crossed because I missed my connection somewhere.

162
00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Instead of going out and seeing the world I was caught brought back home and beaten half the death and sent a jail from there and from there to the Minnesota State Training School at Red Wing Minnesota.

163
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Right there and then I began to learn about man's inhumanity to man.

164
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
So he's off to a rough start.

165
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And it was his father and left him and I didn't mention that part.

166
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Obviously I'm not reading every part of the book but his father left the family and then it was up to his mom.

167
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:46.000
I was like he had the more than his share of the rebellious streak that I think most kids have.

168
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
And then he shows up at this Minnesota State Training School.

169
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Back to the book when I first went to the Minnesota State State Training School.

170
00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I was about 12 years old, lively, healthy and very mischievous innocent and ignorant.

171
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Immediately proceeded to educate me to be a good clean upright citizen and accredited to the human race.

172
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
They trained me all right in that training school.

173
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000
During my two years I was trained by two different sets of people to have two different sets of morals.

174
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000
The good people tried to train me to be good and the bad people did train me to be bad.

175
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000
The method that the good people used in training was to beat goodness into me and all the badness out of me.

176
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
And their best but their best wasn't good enough to accomplish what they set out to do.

177
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:42.000
The more they beat me and whipped me the more I hated them and their damn religion.

178
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Oh yes we had plenty of church and religion all right.

179
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I used to be pretty ignorant and not able to read very well.

180
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
So I was always had a hard job learning my Sunday school lessons.

181
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
For failure to learn these lessons I was given a whipping.

182
00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:08.000
During the first year I was there I used to get a beating every Saturday night and sometimes three or four more during the week for doing something I wasn't supposed to do or for not doing something I was supposed to do.

183
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Oh yes I had plenty of abuse.

184
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
They had various methods of punishing us for doing wrong and for teaching us to do right.

185
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000
The most popular with them was to take us to the paint shop so called because they're.

186
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
They used to paint our bodies black and blue.

187
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Naturally I now love Jesus very much much.

188
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Yes I love him so damn much that I would like to crucify him all over again.

189
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:48.000
I was too dumb to learn anything in school so they took me out and put me to work all day washing dishes and waiting on tables and the officers dining room.

190
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Right there I began to get a little revenge on those who abused me when I served some food to the some of the officers.

191
00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:03.000
I used to urinate in their soup coffee or tea and masturbate into their ice cream or dessert and then stand right beside them and watch them eat it.

192
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:12.000
They enjoyed it too because they told me so I wish they could read this now.

193
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:19.000
The next thing I tried to do is poison that Mr. John more by putting rap poison in his right's rice pudding.

194
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:25.000
But they caught me beat me and put me out of the dining room.

195
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.000
About that time I began to try and figure out some way to punish those who punished me.

196
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.000
The only thing I could figure out was to burn down the building in which the paint shop was located.

197
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:50.000
This I did. I got a long thick piece of heavy cotton string wrapped it around and around a long round stick and lit what end of it and hit it in the laundry near some oil soaked rags.

198
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.000
That night the whole place burned down in a cost of $100,000. Nice say.

199
00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Some of the boys who were cleverer than I finally put me wise to how I should perform if I ever wanted to get out of that joint.

200
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:13.000
They told me to act like I was a very good boy. Tell everybody I met. How much I love Jesus and how I wanted to go home and be a good boy.

201
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Go to school and learn to be a preacher.

202
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:25.000
I done just as they suggested and I'm damned if it didn't work out just as slick as hot grease through a tin horn.

203
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:35.000
I was called in before the parole board one day and there I told them all the lies and how did I could and they gave me a parole and let me go home.

204
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:50.000
In that way I first found out how to use religion as a cloak of hypocrisy to cover up my raspalities.

205
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Rough way to kick things off.

206
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:11.000
You're almost like you know you talk about evil you almost feel it for him though. You're almost on his side kind of like yeah I want to just beating you up your whole life making just grinding you if you're on beating you up and then like yes you're getting that's how you feel right now.

207
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Well it's one of those things that's going to be.

208
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:39.000
You know yeah you feel sympathetic for someone and then you as as that person moves through life first of all it's there's other people that have been through worse things that turn out great and wonderful human beings and there's other people that go through less that turn out worse right so there's.

209
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:54.000
It's I'm those psychologists but there's there's it's one of the things that's troubling about this and as you as you hear what he goes through and what he turns into.

210
00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Yeah it's it's definitely a challenge and you know at the end of the day in my opinion like hey you're still responsible for your actions and hey we get it that you went through some hard things.

211
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:35.000
That doesn't give you an excuse to behave in in an immoral way just doesn't yeah doesn't I'm sure that you know like he you say now he's you know pissing in the soup and whatnot it I mean I'm assuming that was of the people who were trying to correct them and you know beating them more staff you know staff of the of the school where he was being trained.

212
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Yeah so I think that's sort of why you're like kind of feeling for him because it's like oh yeah you're getting direct revenge on that kind of thing and you're of course you're angry kid.

213
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Yeah of course what you went through but then yeah once you start just taking it out like oh let me see innocent person I'm mad at them because their life is and then you kill them or something then that's when you're going to start to not feel for them.

214
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
I'm sure.

215
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Yeah I think so too yeah I guess you do get that kind of feeling like oh these guys are beating you up Nike and a little revenge.

216
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000
You could you could make a positive movie about that right you could make a positive story you could spin it yeah I mean depending on where it goes from there.

217
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
So right now you're you're on his side.

218
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Yeah basically come here.

219
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:35.000
I'm back to the book after serving about two years there I was pronounced by the parole board to be a nice clean boy of good morals as pure as a lily and a credit to those no authority in the in the instruction where I'd been sent to be reformed.

220
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Yes sure I was reformed all right damn good and reformed too.

221
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:48.000
When I got out of there I knew all about Jesus in the Bible so much so that I knew it was all a lot of hot air.

222
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
That was not all I knew I'd been taught by Christians how to be a hypocrite.

223
00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:00.000
And I learned about stealing lying, hating, burning and killing.

224
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.000
From the treatment I received while there and the lessons I learned from it I had fully decided when I left there just how I would live my life.

225
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:17.000
I made up my mind that I would rob burn, destroy and kill everywhere I went and everybody as long as I lived.

226
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
That's the way I was reformed in the Minnesota State Training School. That's the reason why.

227
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:30.000
So that's a little bit more that that's that's where you have something in his personality right there's something.

228
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.000
There's plenty of people that went to this school that didn't go and he did he made that's something snapped.

229
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Where he decided that he was just going to make his life a life of making people suffer.

230
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Going on back to the book I did not want to learn these lessons but I found out that it isn't what one wants in this world that one gets.

231
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Force and might make right.

232
00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Perhaps things shouldn't be that way but that's the way they are.

233
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
I learned to look with suspicion and hatred on everybody.

234
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000
As a year's went on that persisted in my mind that persisted that idea persisted in my mind above all others.

235
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:22.000
I figured that if I were strong enough and clever enough to impose my will on others I was right.

236
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
I still believe that to this day.

237
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
So this is just this twisted.

238
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
It's really it doesn't take long for him to get pretty twisted.

239
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Like there's a lesson here of the lesson that he talks about if I found out that it isn't in the what one wants in the world that one gets.

240
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Actually, it's important lesson but you don't always get what you want.

241
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:54.000
But then taking that to say, hey, if I'm strong enough and I can force my will on things then I'll get what I want more often.

242
00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Yeah and that he did say clever enough to which kind of it's weird because like a real low super low level of that still goes on I think with a lot of people.

243
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:28.000
You know, you're justifying things in your head, you know, be like, oh, you know, when you do something bad where you do something you know is unfair even that kind of low level stuff like it's not hurting no bunch for sure but it's like maybe not fair or something like that and you just justify in your head.

244
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Like some people their clever like they're smart so they can justify their justifications or way more legit seeming because they're real smart they can just you know.

245
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
It's kind of like what you see the lawyers doing the movie.

246
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:52.000
You know, you paint someone to be like someone like what the you kind of take things out of context and put other things in context and not supposed to be there kind of thing and yeah you just kind of paint this picture in your own mind.

247
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Why what you're doing is right and of course another people's mind to you know and you're clever enough to get why with it.

248
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Yeah, you're you're justifying it yourself and he's he's not even talking about that he doesn't need to justify himself he's doing he's doing to to get what he wants.

249
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Yeah and his use of being clever isn't to justify to himself his use of being clever is just to outwit people and take advantage of be a con man.

250
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:35.000
And he gets so he's in and out of prison and he goes back in a prison he gets out of prison he goes back in a prison here at this point he broke out of prison and he hooks up with a guy named Jimmy Benson back to the book he showed me how to work the stick up racket and how to rob the poor boxes and churches.

251
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
I in turn taught him how to set fire to a church after we robbed it.

252
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:46.000
We got very busy on that robbing and burning a church regular every chance we got.

253
00:27:46.000 --> 00:28:02.000
When we got tired of writing a train because this is their their you know hitching on these trains when he got tired of writing on a train we used to open up the journal boxes take out the greasy waste packing and throwing some sand or gravel into it they wouldn't get far with that car so.

254
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:11.000
They get done writing a train and they just destroy it they really they ruin the gear boxes just general destruction of everything.

255
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
I continue to end it out of prison one time he's drunk.

256
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:28.000
And here's a guy talking about the army and ends up enlisting in the army back to the book I was only in the army a month or two when I got three years in US military prison at Fort Levenworth Kansas.

257
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:39.000
I had the job of swinging 18 pound hammer in the rock quarry most of my bit my number was 1874 and my name was Carl Panzeram.

258
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:48.000
There I done 37 months I done plenty of work and I had plenty of punishment and the only good part of it was that they didn't try to hammer any more religion into me.

259
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:58.000
At this time of my life I was about 20 years old six foot tall and weighed about 190 pound of concentrated hell fired man inspired meness.

260
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
I was strong as two or three average men.

261
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:13.000
I had to be to be able to withstand some of the punishments in labor that I went through during my three years in the US military prison.

262
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:20.000
One of my tasks in punishments while there was to be shackled to a 50 pound iron ball for six months.

263
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
During that time I wore the ball and chain day and night slept with it and work with it on.

264
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:32.000
My work was in the rock quarry and that was three miles from the prison the gang of about 300 convicts and 40 screws used to march out in the morning and back at night.

265
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:54.000
The other men had to carry nothing except themselves but my part was to load my iron ball an 18 pound hammer a pick and shovel in a six foot iron crowbar all into a wheelbarrow and march behind the line of cons out to the quarry and work there for eight and a half hours in the hot Kansas sun busting big rocks.

266
00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:04.000
But all that treatment did one good thing for me the worst food was and the harbor they worked me the stronger I got.

267
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
So he got a good workout already big.

268
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:15.000
He said yeah he's six feet to 190 pounds back in what is it 1900 or whatever he's a yolk dude back then.

269
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:25.000
All this hardcore physical labor and yeah he's turning into a very scary dude.

270
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Back to the book I was discharged from prison in 1910 by the way can you imagine you're in the army for a couple months and you get put in the eleven worth for three years.

271
00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:49.000
I was the spirit of meanness personified. I had not at this time got so that I hated myself I only hated everybody else.

272
00:30:49.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Before I left there I sung on the same old song and gave him the same line about how I sure love Jesus and what a nice young man I was and how much good I it had done me to be sent to that prison.

273
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:12.000
I don't know if they believe me or not but they all said they did anyway they all declared that I was pure as a lily and free from sin.

274
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Again there's so a bunch of travel and there's a bunch of crazy he's a constant criminal and it is another thing we realize back in this day the reason he named he said oh at this time I was Carl Panzeram is because he changes his name a bunch because that's what just what you would do back then if you were a criminal.

275
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:42.000
And there's no electronic tracking system there's no phone numbers no cell phone there's not even a phone like phones and everyone's houses so you can get away with murder quite literally and he does.

276
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:51.000
But he he's maybe not the best criminal as well because he gets caught a lot you know for Robin and stealing and part of it's because he has like a dozen carat.

277
00:31:51.000 --> 00:32:00.000
So he gets put he gets arrested at different time he gets put into a chain gang and he eventually.

278
00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:17.000
breaks away from escapes the chain gang and then he goes continuing skipping trains and ends up with an Indian guy and they work together as a little team and they rob a guy and here we go back to the book the Indian tied him up.

279
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:27.000
And he felt pulled his pants down to below his knees and tied his legs together then he tied his hands behind his back then he tied his hands to his feet pulled together.

280
00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Then he stuffed a socket his mouth and tied a handkerchief tight over that and then tied him to a tree.

281
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:44.000
He was then ready to leave him and walk away but I wasn't through yet I figured while I had such a good chances that I would commit a little saw to me on him.

282
00:32:44.000 --> 00:33:05.000
I proceeded to do and he mentions at one point that he hooked up with a girl and got some kind of VD and then he was like oh girls not they're dirty and so that's why he goes after guys now.

283
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Back to the book at night while I was riding for the freight trains I was always on the lookout for something to shoot.

284
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Or trying to stick up the hobos that I met on the trains. I looked them all over and whenever I met one who wasn't too rusty looking I would make him raises hands and drop his pants.

285
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:37.000
I wasn't very particular either. I rode them old and young tall and short white and black it made no difference to me.

286
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Someone's later I was pinched at Chinook Montana for burglary.

287
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000
I quick took a plea of guilty and got one year at the state prison at Dear Lodge Montana.

288
00:33:50.000 --> 00:34:01.000
When I got there I met my old partner Jimmy Benson who is doing 10 years for robbery. I stayed there about eight months and escaped. He's also good at escaping. He escapes all these things all the time.

289
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:16.000
A week later I was arrested in three forks Montana for burglary under the name of Jeff Rhodes. I pleaded guilty and got a year and was sent back to Dear Lodge where I was at once brought to court and given one year for my escape under the name Jeff Davis.

290
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Out of these three sentences I served 23 months in that prison there was only work for a few men and I wasn't one of those.

291
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:34.000
All the cells were for two men in each cell. Each man could choose his own cell mates and get a new one anytime you wanted. I used to want a new one pretty regular.

292
00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
At that place and time I got to be an experienced wolf.

293
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:52.000
I knew more about Sodomy than old boy Oscar Wilde ever thought of knowing I would start in the morning with Sodomy work as hard as as hard at it as I could all day and sometimes half the night.

294
00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:05.000
I was so busy committing Sodomy that I didn't have time left to serve Jesus as I had been taught to in those reform schools.

295
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:13.000
He gets out of that prison as soon as I got to Oregon and get to put another prison. I got to as soon as I got to Oregon State prison I was in more trouble.

296
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:20.000
I score I would never do the seven years and defied the warden and all his officers to make me.

297
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Get to put in solitary confinement. Here we go in solitary confinement. There are coolers and coolers.

298
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Some are bad and some are worse. None are good. Some are cold and wet. Some are hot and dry. Some you freeze and others you roast and sweat. In all you are hungry and thirsty and filthy and dirty.

299
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:44.000
And some you stay a day. Others a week. And there have been times when I had been in the cooler a month or more.

300
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Bread and water isn't very nourishing and neither does it generate clean thinking and a person's mind. The milk of human kindness generally curdles and turns into sour under such conditions.

301
00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
The more cooler you get, the more heat and hate there is in your heart.

302
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:13.000
In every joint I was ever in. There was always some form of torture that was on tap. I used the got my share of every kind there was. I've had them all at one time or another.

303
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
And then he goes on through a bunch of different.

304
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Torture that they would use on these prisoners from like straight jacket type things. There's something called the snording pole.

305
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Which is a post about 12 feet long. You get basically tied to it. You get whipped.

306
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Back to the book when the lash begins to take away little bits of hide and the blood begins to run. Then the sucker begins to jerk and yell. And snort. That's why it's called the snording pole.

307
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:55.000
When a man is let down after being whipped he has blood on his back and murder in his heart.

308
00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:04.000
That's all about the snording pole. There's the bat in the paddle. Here's this thing. The restraint machine.

309
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:12.000
The restraint machine barefooted standing on a cold damp concrete floor backed up to an iron bar door hands behind cuff to the door.

310
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
A large belt under my arms around my chest pulled tight to the door.

311
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Standing in that position for four hours then let down for one hour to eat my bread and water then four hours more than to bed, which was aboard no blankets.

312
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:36.000
In the morning bread and water and then four hours more and so on for a stretch of anywhere from five to 14 days. That was the limit. That's your restraint machine.

313
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:50.000
You've ever heard? Okay. I know you're claustrophobic, right? Sure. Yeah. I mean you are. But sometimes I don't think I'm claustrophobic but sometimes I want to move a limb, right?

314
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
You know what I'm saying?

315
00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:04.000
And for instance you're on a plane and you're all tight in an economy seat up against the bulkhead and there's like it's tight.

316
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:12.000
You know that part of the plane towards the back where the bulkhead kind of curves and so you're even losing a little bit more space.

317
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:23.000
And you just want to move, you know, but you can't because the seat belt light just went on over there. Yes. Now imagine doing four hours like that for 14 days.

318
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Four hours twice a day for 14 days.

319
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Yes. That's hard.

320
00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Yeah, that's actually really harsh. So there's like two way and to Samclot because claustrophobia usually is like, you know,

321
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:47.000
you're going to an elevator and you feel it that kind, you know, I don't have it like that. But yeah, maybe I'm a little bit more sensitive to those kind of side controls side control claustrophobia.

322
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Well, you know, I used to, yes, but this is more what it is to put accurately.

323
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Did I yield me? Yeah.

324
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Actually what it was was like you just got in better shape. That's all because like it wasn't it was the idea that I'm like tired and I won't be able to get out there.

325
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Like I'm stuck here forever. I'm going to die here. That's the feeling you get. But when I wasn't tired, I'm like, oh, no, I can cruise down here. I just don't know. It felt like it was better.

326
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000
The last time we rolled, didn't you have a little issue down there? No. Are you sure? Yes.

327
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
I don't remember having any issue.

328
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:39.000
I've been really good recently, probably like year. It's been years. But that's the feeling is what it is. So, but here's when I got an MRI on my arm. You tap to something the other day that's not tapping offense. I forget what it was.

329
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
It was your that that forum on my throat. Remember it was.

330
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:53.000
It didn't fit like I couldn't. It was too like you did it too hard for me to have time to figure out. I can turn this way or what it to relieve the pain. You did it like too fast.

331
00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:02.000
I did it with like a little extra like a little. Yeah, it wasn't like a striker and nothing like that. But yeah, it was like, I would have got my throat would have gotten injured if I would have.

332
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:18.000
I had an MRI on my. Oh, you're selling that tube. Yeah. So, which is fine if you're just in a comfortable position. It can be when you open your eyes and you look out for it.

333
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:36.000
It's a tube is like lit inches in front of your face and you're in there. Yeah, I can kind of jam you up. But you just close your eyes and be like, oh, that's big. It's a customer is a big deal in the in the seal teams, especially if you're going to do it because you had to lock out of the sub submarine chambers, which isn't in the old days.

334
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:48.000
The submarine chamber that wasn't built for seals to lock out of, it was built for an escape hatch if there's an emergency on the submarine.

335
00:40:48.000 --> 00:41:08.000
So, you can do a little chamber and then once you're in the little chamber, it fills with water equalized with the outside and then the door opens up and you can just go. That's that's called a lock out chamber and we used to do that. And there's still we still do it, but like it's a little bit more of a specialized group that does that now, but it used to just be a general thing for good for if you were in the days, do that.

336
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:18.000
And we could definitely because you're in there with equipment. So, a while, like we take a lot of time to get a whole seal squad out.

337
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Like what, like what's a while? Well, you'd be in that little chamber for probably 15 minutes at a time, but here's the thing you're in there. There's two major situations going on. Number one, you're not just in there.

338
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:41.000
You're in there with like one or two other guys, but you're also in there with equipment. So you have bags of weapons, waterproof weapons. You actually have your boats in there.

339
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000
And they're, so it's all tight. And here's what it really took.

340
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
So the water starts to fill. This starts to fill up.

341
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:57.000
And then as it's filling up, it gets to a point where you've got to keep it equalized and you're using these little pressure valves.

342
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:04.000
You basically crank a valve that pushes air into the chamber. And so that pushes the water down.

343
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:13.000
If you're not good, then you're going to mess up the pressure and you're going to, it's called losing the bubble because there's a bubble of air that you're just sitting there breathing.

344
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:21.000
If you don't equalize the pressure well, then that bubble just keeps going up and then you lose the bubble the bubble's gone.

345
00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Which I think is where the, that's what I always thought losing the bubble. You've heard that term, right?

346
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
No. Okay. When someone says, oh, he's losing the bubble. You've never heard that before?

347
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
No. Well, we would say it. And I've heard it. I've heard civilians say it too. So pretty sure that's it.

348
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Yeah. But I think that that's where it came from. It's like, oh, you're losing the bubble. And I've been in the chamber when someone lost the bubble.

349
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Yeah.

350
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
And I remember, I was telling the guy, I was like, hey, you're losing the bubble. You're losing the bubble. You're losing the bubble.

351
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
You're losing the bubble. You're losing the bubble. You're losing the bubble. You're losing the bubble.

352
00:42:51.000 --> 00:43:01.000
And then I'm underwater. And then you've got to find the, you've got to find the octopus, which is the regulator, which you have, you have air tanks just in there, like compressed air tanks, like scuba tanks that are strapped to the wall.

353
00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Just in case someone loses the bubble.

354
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
And then you've got to find they got to camp late on the red camp lights and you're just digging out.

355
00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Oh, you grab the red, come on. You find your thing. You start breathing and you find the valve and you crank it. And then the bubble comes back.

356
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
But yeah. Yeah. But if you're, if you're claustrophobic in that situation, it's going to be problematic.

357
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Big-ton. Yeah.

358
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Huge. Yeah.

359
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Just like, like, expression on your face at this time tells me that you would not, how big was it?

360
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
How big is the chambers?

361
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Like, it's smaller than the area that you and I are sitting right now.

362
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
So yeah.

363
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.000
So my MRI for my bicep, I had to go like this, like, my hand up in the air.

364
00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Well, you know, I'm laying down. So it's not up in the air. But like, so you're not laying regular.

365
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
One hand is up. Okay.

366
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
And for 15 minutes in that little teeny tiny tube.

367
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
So like, are you saying, I could lay on my bed like that?

368
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Did they sedate you or anything?

369
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
No. You just dealt with it?

370
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
No. Yeah. This is not how about a few MRIs in my time.

371
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
But I just relax or when in there.

372
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Yeah. I didn't lose the bubble like you did it.

373
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Right. No, no, no. The thing is I did it. Well, here's the thing.

374
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:10.000
So this is what I really admitted to myself. Okay. I have like a little sensitivity to it.

375
00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000
So you know, see, he's like, okay, you got to put your arm up because it, you know, and you can't move.

376
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
So I'm thinking, man, I can just lay down my bed like this all day.

377
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.000
I'll sleep like that, you know, but why am I super like nervous about this?

378
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000
So I go in and he's putting me in and I feel my heart just start being real fast.

379
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Like, full on my call man.

380
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000
But, but I mentally push through it.

381
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Like the kind of doctor like not even a minute, but maybe like 30, 45 seconds.

382
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000
And like, you know, you're watching guys cave diving.

383
00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Like, what do you mean? No. Yes, guys.

384
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. We're under water, but it's under water cave.

385
00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Yeah. And you're diving. Yeah. That can get a little tight.

386
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Yeah. So, and that I weed, um, on Kwa, there's a place called the Blue Room.

387
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
And it's that.

388
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
And here's the thing. So it's basically a cave. You walk up this mountain.

389
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
You like, I don't know, 50, 50 yards, maybe up a mountain.

390
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
And you go into the mountain.

391
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Well, no, no, the mountain is here. You just walk up 50 yards then.

392
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
There's a cave. That's where the cave is.

393
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
And you go in the cave and depending on, you know, how much it rained or whatever.

394
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
There's a little lake in the caves.

395
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
It's really cool. We always go at the back of the cave.

396
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
It's a little teeny tiny hole, teeny tiny hole.

397
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000
If the water's too high and it covers that hole, it's still a hole, but it's on you got to go underwater.

398
00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
So at the end of that, it basically, that hole is a hallway that you swim through. You can't touch the bottom.

399
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
It's like you swim through this little hallway and it goes in and curves.

400
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
This is maybe a 20, 20 yards, maybe.

401
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.000
And not 20. That's, that's, you know, maybe 10 yards in the dark though.

402
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:58.000
And the only light is this glowing bright blue light that the water creates from the sun that shines in the water and kind of reflects up.

403
00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000
It's really, it's really nice, but yeah, if you have an issue with that,

404
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Especially if the water gets another side, what do you use?

405
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
It's a big room in now. That's the thing that's open to the light.

406
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000
The light from the water lights up the room.

407
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000
So it's, yeah, it's really weird. That's why you kind of go because it's really awesome.

408
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
The thing is there's nothing to hold onto. You're trading water in that room.

409
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000
So it's like, oh, the room is deep water.

410
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Yeah, you can't touch it. He was like in there.

411
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
So you can't touch the bottom at all.

412
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000
You know, but if the water level is high enough where that cave or the hall table call it,

413
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000
It's like this, you know, where you can just barely to, it gets like, oh, this is kind of nerve wracking for sure.

414
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
But sometimes it's real low and it's cool you just swim through.

415
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:48.000
But if it's like your first time, or you have a little bit of claustrophobia in water like that, you know, it'll jam you up for sure.

416
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000
But I never had a problem with that one.

417
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:58.000
It's that it's what you said when you know you can't move. But if you know you can move also, you can just stay there.

418
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000
It's weird. It's like a psychological thing, you know?

419
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Yeah, no, it's just a psychological thing.

420
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
But yeah, I get that every once in a while on the plane too.

421
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
The restraint machine.

422
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:15.000
So I guess that would be really effective against some people that have a little claustrophobia.

423
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Or they would get so nothing.

424
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
The thing is though, okay, let's say all these methods are bad, right?

425
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Let's say all these methods of reform are bad.

426
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
I feel good about saying that.

427
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Okay, and then you say, okay, if I was in that situation, I would do everything I could to get out of the scenario where, like, okay, I got arrested and I got put in the restraint machine and I got the beat with the paddle and I got all those things happening.

428
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Guess what?

429
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000
You know what I'm going to do is try and stay clean on a little bit, right?

430
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Get on the maybe get on a little bit of a path, a better path.

431
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Yes, sir.

432
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000
It didn't work that all.

433
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
At all.

434
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
He didn't care.

435
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Yeah.

436
00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Well, it kind of makes sense that like, when, what did he say went after the snording pole or whatever, like, oh, you just fell out of your back and murdered it.

437
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Yeah, yeah.

438
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Yeah, that seems like because even the claustrophobia thing on the, on the, on the, on the, what's that called the restraint situation.

439
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Four hours every, like every session all day.

440
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:19.000
You know, like, perhaps after all, you're like, you're going to get used to that or you're going to go so nuts that you're just going to faint or I don't know something like that.

441
00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Either way, there's a part of your mind, I would think, I don't know.

442
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Let's just what it feels like listening to it.

443
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000
I feel like I would just be so nuts at the end.

444
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Like, I would, I wouldn't care about that restraint thing.

445
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
I would just care about like murdering the person or something.

446
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000
I could see how that could go.

447
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Yeah.

448
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000
I mean, I personally could go that way.

449
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
I probably try not to go there anymore, but that's just me.

450
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Yeah, so maybe as a reformer, if you cross the line and you make someone snap now, you're no longer being productive.

451
00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:56.000
This is true with your kids, then maybe you haven't experienced this yet, but you can go like push your kids to a point where they don't care.

452
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Yeah, like, oh, I'll take this away.

453
00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000
I'll take this away.

454
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000
And then all of a sudden they go, I don't care.

455
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Take it.

456
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
They throw their, you know, the toilet that you're threatening me throw it at you.

457
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Yeah.

458
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Take it.

459
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Remember the breakfast club, remember that movie?

460
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000
I do remember that part that I John Bender.

461
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Well, this is really free of the act.

462
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Just kidding.

463
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
But anyway, I'm just trying to play Bender.

464
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Is this name?

465
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Which guy is which character?

466
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000
The bad guy, the bad kid.

467
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Okay.

468
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Yeah.

469
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
And he's really, and he's like, um, he's like, hey, did Barry Manelow raid or did you,

470
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
would raid Barry Manelow's wardrobe?

471
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
And he's like, I'll keep you the answer to that.

472
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Uh, next Saturday saying like, you got another detention here next Saturday.

473
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000
And then he says something else because then you got another Saturday.

474
00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
And he's like, well, I'm free to start it.

475
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000
You know, he did that.

476
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000
You're not doing it.

477
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Yeah.

478
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000
And then he's holding up the horn.

479
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Two months.

480
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Bender.

481
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
I got two months.

482
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.000
That was good.

483
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
That was a good part there.

484
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
So yes, you can't push it too far.

485
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000
And obviously, from a leadership perspective, we'll just go for a little leadership perspective.

486
00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000
There are things you can do to the people that work for you where they won't care anymore.

487
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Yeah.

488
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000
And now you, now you, you're done.

489
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
You have you lost control of.

490
00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
So don't do that.

491
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
He talks about this electric electric shock to you.

492
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
They called the hummingbird.

493
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000
First an ordinary steel bathtub with in which four or five inches of ice cold water.

494
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
The victim is laid down in there and chained hand and foot.

495
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Then the chief torture enters the scene.

496
00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:29.000
He's dressed in ordinary clothes and has only a rubber slicker and a pair of rubber gloves on his hands.

497
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:32.000
And his hands heal to common sponge.

498
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000
The sponge is connected to electric battery by wires.

499
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000
The switch is turned on in the torture advances on the victim.

500
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000
He first begins on the souls of the feet by gently rubbing the charge sponge there.

501
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000
And then gradually working his way up to the body and to the head.

502
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:53.000
The sensations of to the victim are that there seems to be millions of red hot needles sticking into him.

503
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000
The agony is intense.

504
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Two or three minutes and the victim is ready for the grave or the madhouse.

505
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Yet there is not a single mark or bruise on his whole body.

506
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.000
A physician stands beside the victim and every few seconds feels the pulse and examines him.

507
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:13.000
When he judges that the victim is exactly on the verge of madness or death, he gives the signal to switch off the current.

508
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Then the victim is thrown into a cell where he is left for a few days or weeks.

509
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Yeah.

510
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000
The victim is ready for the grave or the madhouse.

511
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Yet there is not a single mark or bruise on his whole body.

512
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000
That's weird the sponge.

513
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000
How they put the sponge there.

514
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Like on lethal weapon one.

515
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000
He got rags with that.

516
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Yeah, yeah.

517
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
And remember it.

518
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000
But he has that sort of, maybe think of when he had the sponges.

519
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
And he's in the shower.

520
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000
I'll tie it up like that.

521
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000
He keeps like hitting them.

522
00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000
He's like hitting them again.

523
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Yeah, those sponges.

524
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000
I wonder what that's about though.

525
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000
The sponge.

526
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000
It conducts.

527
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Just can it let your city.

528
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Yeah, because it will have a water water conduct.

529
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Yeah, that's the same with direct mark.

530
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:03.000
It's just hitting you with like a big shock pillow of shock.

531
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Okay.

532
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000
It continues on.

533
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.000
He gets eventually gets out of that prison.

534
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
And he actually broke out of that prison.

535
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000
And then he's now he's just on like full crime mode.

536
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
I don't even know what those beyond crime mode.

537
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000
But just full stealing, raping, murdering, swindling.

538
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
He steals enough money.

539
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
He works on a bunch of different boats.

540
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000
And eventually steals enough money to buy a yacht.

541
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000
So he's bought a yacht.

542
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Yeah.

543
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
And I don't know what how big the yacht was.

544
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
But it wasn't small.

545
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
And here we go back to the book.

546
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000
On my yacht, I had quarters for five people.

547
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000
But I was alone for a while.

548
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Then I figured it would be a good plan to hire a few sailors to work for me.

549
00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Get them out on my yacht.

550
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Get them drunk.

551
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Commit saw to me on them.

552
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Rob them and kill them.

553
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
This I done.

554
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Every day or two, I would get plenty of blues booze by robbing other yachts there.

555
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.000
The barber two was one of them.

556
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
I robbed her dozen or so.

557
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Others around there.

558
00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000
I was hitting the booze pretty hard myself at that time.

559
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:10.000
Every day or two, I would go to New York and hang around 25th Street and size up the sailors.

560
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000
Whenever I saw a couple who were about my size and seemed to have money,

561
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
I would hire them to work on my yacht.

562
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000
I would always promise a big pay and easy work.

563
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000
What they got was something else.

564
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.000
I would take them and their clothes and gear out to my yacht at City Island.

565
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000
There we would go and wine and dine and when they were drunk enough,

566
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000
I would go to bed or they would go to bed.

567
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000
When they were sleeper to get my 45 cult automatic.

568
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Army pistol.

569
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:43.000
This I stole from Mr. Taff's house and blow their brains out.

570
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Then I would take out a rope and tie a rock on them and put them into my rope out.

571
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Roll them out in the main channel about one mile and drop them overboard.

572
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.000
They are there yet, 10 of them.

573
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000
I worked that racket for about three weeks.

574
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000
Eventually it gets on another ship.

575
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Loses that. It kind of gets people are suspect.

576
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
He goes, gets on a ship to Europe from Europe.

577
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:15.000
He goes to Africa.

578
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
In Africa, he buys a girl.

579
00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
I paid a big price for her.

580
00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:24.000
I bought her from her mother and father for about $8.00 in American money.

581
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000
The reason I paid such a big price for her was because she was a virgin.

582
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Yeah, so she said.

583
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
She was about 11 or 12 years old.

584
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000
I took her to my shack the first night and took her back to her father's and shack the next.

585
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:42.000
I demanded my money back because they had deceived me by saying the girl was a virgin.

586
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.000
I didn't get my money back but they gave me another younger girl.

587
00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:48.000
This girl was about eight years old.

588
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000
I took her to my shack and maybe she was a virgin but it didn't look like it to me.

589
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000
I took her back and quit looking for any more virgins.

590
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000
I look for a boy.

591
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000
I found one.

592
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
He was our table waiter.

593
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:05.000
I educated him into the art of Saudi me as practiced by civilized people.

594
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000
But he was only a savage and didn't appreciate the benefits of civilisation.

595
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:17.000
He told my boss and the boss man fired me quick but before he did I looked to hell out of him.

596
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
The boy, 11 or 12, came a woman.

597
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000
Another boy, about 11 or 12 came a woman around.

598
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:27.000
He was looking for something he found it too.

599
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.000
I took him out to a gravel pit about a quarter mile from the main camp of the sink clear.

600
00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Oil company.

601
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000
I left him there but first I committed saw to me on him and then killed him.

602
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:51.000
His brains were coming out of his ears when I left him and he will never be any dead or he is still there.

603
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.000
He ends up murdering another six people in Africa and a boat.

604
00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:05.000
He chartered a canoe and then kills everyone in it and then signs onto a ship that's heading back to New York.

605
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000
He was the summer of 1922. He arrives back in America back to the book and Salem massed

606
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Tuesets. I murdered an 11 or 12 year old boy by beating his brains out with a rock.

607
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000
I tried a little saw to me on him first.

608
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000
I left him laying there with his brains coming out of his ears.

609
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:26.000
Went down towards New York, robbing and hell raising as I came.

610
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.000
In January of February of 1923 I got a job.

611
00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000
I was a watchman at 220 y.m.

612
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
I have a new york.

613
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:40.000
While there I met a young boy of 14 or 15, his name was George and whose home was in was and is in Yonkers.

614
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:47.000
I started to teach him the fine art of sawdemy but he had but I found he had been taught about it all and he liked it fine.

615
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.000
I kept him with me until I left that job of in April of 1923.

616
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000
The kid George got scared and I let him go home to Yonkers when he got there.

617
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000
He told the police all he knew about me which wasn't much but it was enough for the cops to come.

618
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.000
Looking for me they caught me and my yacht at Naya.

619
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:10.000
They took me and all my plunder to Yonkers jail there.

620
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Charge me with sawdemy, burglary, robbery and trying to break jail there.

621
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:22.000
In and out again a few days later I went to New Haven where I killed another boy.

622
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:26.000
I committed a little more sawdemy on him and then tied his belt around his neck and strangled him.

623
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Pick him up where he was when he was dead and threw his body over behind some bushes.

624
00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Eventually he does his time he gets trial for the sawdemy, burglary and robbery.

625
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:58.000
He's guilty and immediately given the limit of the law five years at once. I was sent to Sing Sing.

626
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:15.62
Story of the

627
00:58:15.62 --> 00:58:17.34
He's in this really bad prison.

628
00:58:17.34 --> 00:58:20.18
And there's a description that's not from him.

629
00:58:20.18 --> 00:58:22.66
That's just part of the book, part of the information in the book.

630
00:58:22.66 --> 00:58:24.58
Talking about Dana Mora.

631
00:58:24.58 --> 00:58:27.86
And how bad it is there.

632
00:58:27.86 --> 00:58:32.50
And then he's done all hope this heinous.

633
00:58:32.50 --> 00:58:36.14
I mean, just heinous acts that he should be killed

634
00:58:36.14 --> 00:58:39.50
for over and over again.

635
00:58:39.50 --> 00:58:41.90
And here he is going back to the book.

636
00:58:41.90 --> 00:58:43.82
I attempted to escape.

637
00:58:43.82 --> 00:58:48.30
I failed in my attempt to put a doing so I fell about 30 feet to a concrete walk, breaking

638
00:58:48.30 --> 00:58:51.90
both my ankles, both my legs, fracturing my spine and rupturing myself.

639
00:58:51.90 --> 00:58:55.06
In this condition, I was carried to the prison hospital where I lay for five days and was

640
00:58:55.06 --> 00:58:59.66
carried out and dumped into a cell without any medical or surgical attention.

641
00:58:59.66 --> 00:59:01.14
Whatever.

642
00:59:01.14 --> 00:59:02.66
My broken bones were not set.

643
00:59:02.66 --> 00:59:04.62
My ankles and legs were not put into a cast.

644
00:59:04.62 --> 00:59:09.78
In fact, nothing was done except give me a bottle of liniment, which I would have done

645
00:59:09.78 --> 00:59:13.50
which would have done no good if I had been able to rub it on myself.

646
00:59:13.50 --> 00:59:16.46
The doctor never came near me and no one else was allowed to do anything for me.

647
00:59:16.46 --> 00:59:18.74
In that condition, I was left for eight months.

648
00:59:18.74 --> 00:59:22.34
At the end of the time, the bones had knitted together so I could stagger around on a pair

649
00:59:22.34 --> 00:59:23.34
of crutches.

650
00:59:23.34 --> 00:59:26.26
So it's like he's complaining about his mal-treatment.

651
00:59:26.26 --> 00:59:27.26
Right?

652
00:59:27.26 --> 00:59:28.74
I don't injured and they didn't take care of it.

653
00:59:28.74 --> 00:59:30.54
It's like, hey, bro.

654
00:59:30.54 --> 00:59:31.54
Yeah.

655
00:59:31.54 --> 00:59:38.50
You don't get any good treatment.

656
00:59:38.50 --> 00:59:43.10
At the end of 14 months of constant agony, I was taken to the hospital where I was operated

657
00:59:43.10 --> 00:59:45.82
on for my rupture and one of my testicles was cut out.

658
00:59:45.82 --> 00:59:49.90
Five days after my operation, I tried to see if my sexual organs were still in go and order.

659
00:59:49.90 --> 00:59:52.74
I got caught trying to commit Sodomy on another prisoner.

660
00:59:52.74 --> 00:59:56.38
For that, I was thrown out of the hospital and dumped into a cell where I suffered more agony

661
00:59:56.38 --> 00:59:57.74
for many months.

662
00:59:57.74 --> 01:00:02.90
Always in pain, never a civil answer for anyone, always a snaller, a curse, or a lying,

663
01:00:02.90 --> 01:00:05.34
hypocritical promise which was never kept.

664
01:00:05.34 --> 01:00:09.14
Crawling around like a snake with a broken back, seething with hatred and a lust for revenge

665
01:00:09.14 --> 01:00:12.98
five years of my life of this kind.

666
01:00:12.98 --> 01:00:17.38
For the last two years and four months, confined in isolation with nothing to do except

667
01:00:17.38 --> 01:00:23.46
bruised upon what I thought was the wrongs that had been done to me not allowed to receive

668
01:00:23.46 --> 01:00:25.38
letters or visits from friends.

669
01:00:25.38 --> 01:00:28.70
When the prison inspectors came to investigate conditions and complaints, they were told

670
01:00:28.70 --> 01:00:31.54
I was a degenerate that I suffered from delusions.

671
01:00:31.54 --> 01:00:35.98
That I was insane so they would pay no attention to me or anything that I or anyone else

672
01:00:35.98 --> 01:00:38.42
ever complained of.

673
01:00:38.42 --> 01:00:42.42
This went on for all of my five years and the more they misused me, the more I was

674
01:00:42.42 --> 01:00:44.58
filled the spirit of hatred and revenge.

675
01:00:44.58 --> 01:00:50.02
I was so full of hate that there was no room in me for such feelings as love, pity, kindness,

676
01:00:50.02 --> 01:00:51.54
or honor, or decency.

677
01:00:51.54 --> 01:00:57.02
I hated everyone I saw.

678
01:00:57.02 --> 01:01:02.58
Again, it's a guy that he only sees the pain that's been caused to him but apparently

679
01:01:02.58 --> 01:01:06.02
doesn't see any of the pain that he's causing anybody else.

680
01:01:06.02 --> 01:01:08.02
Zero empathy.

681
01:01:08.02 --> 01:01:09.02
Zero.

682
01:01:09.02 --> 01:01:15.78
Doesn't it seem or could it happen like this with him?

683
01:01:15.78 --> 01:01:16.78
Where?

684
01:01:16.78 --> 01:01:20.78
When he's young, he gets beat down.

685
01:01:20.78 --> 01:01:23.58
Obviously not shown much affection.

686
01:01:23.58 --> 01:01:24.86
That's some assumption obviously.

687
01:01:24.86 --> 01:01:25.86
But beat down.

688
01:01:25.86 --> 01:01:27.22
So now he has his hatred.

689
01:01:27.22 --> 01:01:32.46
Now he inflicts pain on quote unquote others because of the hatred he has or whatever.

690
01:01:32.46 --> 01:01:34.86
So it's kind of like him kind of what getting even for sure.

691
01:01:34.86 --> 01:01:35.86
For sure.

692
01:01:35.86 --> 01:01:36.86
Like we're better terms.

693
01:01:36.86 --> 01:01:38.98
So he gets even and then he gets punished for that.

694
01:01:38.98 --> 01:01:41.02
Obviously because he can't commit crimes like that.

695
01:01:41.02 --> 01:01:42.62
So he gets punished.

696
01:01:42.62 --> 01:01:44.46
So now he thinks it's uneven now.

697
01:01:44.46 --> 01:01:48.14
Hey, you know, it's just the feeling he's not like yes.

698
01:01:48.14 --> 01:01:51.94
So now he's like, oh, now that now me being punished for what I did by the way, but me being

699
01:01:51.94 --> 01:01:53.70
punishes giving me even more hate.

700
01:01:53.70 --> 01:01:56.30
Now I got a seek vengeance for that.

701
01:01:56.30 --> 01:01:57.30
Then he does it.

702
01:01:57.30 --> 01:01:59.26
Then of course he just keeps doing it.

703
01:01:59.26 --> 01:02:00.90
So it's like this cycle.

704
01:02:00.90 --> 01:02:02.70
Well, there's another cycle here.

705
01:02:02.70 --> 01:02:05.90
And the cycle is he's blaming everyone else for the situation.

706
01:02:05.90 --> 01:02:06.90
That is like that.

707
01:02:06.90 --> 01:02:10.58
You know, he's blaming every and at a certain point, sure.

708
01:02:10.58 --> 01:02:15.58
Let's let's blame that first state penitentiary that he was in when he was a kid, the

709
01:02:15.58 --> 01:02:16.58
state school.

710
01:02:16.58 --> 01:02:17.94
Let's put some blame on them.

711
01:02:17.94 --> 01:02:18.94
Okay.

712
01:02:18.94 --> 01:02:20.66
But you got out of that.

713
01:02:20.66 --> 01:02:24.58
You had another opportunity to get on the right path.

714
01:02:24.58 --> 01:02:26.02
And then what do you do?

715
01:02:26.02 --> 01:02:29.38
You just blame blame blame blame blame blame.

716
01:02:29.38 --> 01:02:33.66
And the more you're blaming other people, do you put yourself into a downward spiral that

717
01:02:33.66 --> 01:02:34.98
he's never going to get out of.

718
01:02:34.98 --> 01:02:35.98
Obviously.

719
01:02:35.98 --> 01:02:37.14
And now he's blaming.

720
01:02:37.14 --> 01:02:38.74
He blames the whole human race.

721
01:02:38.74 --> 01:02:46.58
I mean, let's, it's really easy just to sort of, he only writes about it for three sentences.

722
01:02:46.58 --> 01:02:52.58
But like, oh, oh, a new haven, I raped and murdered on a 11 year old boy.

723
01:02:52.58 --> 01:02:55.26
Like no, you don't get any mercy now.

724
01:02:55.26 --> 01:02:57.02
And you can't blame anyone else for doing that.

725
01:02:57.02 --> 01:02:58.74
That's no one else is fault.

726
01:02:58.74 --> 01:02:59.74
You did that.

727
01:02:59.74 --> 01:03:00.74
Yes.

728
01:03:00.74 --> 01:03:01.74
Yeah.

729
01:03:01.74 --> 01:03:03.74
But in his mind.

730
01:03:03.74 --> 01:03:06.50
Yeah.

731
01:03:06.50 --> 01:03:08.46
Oh, for like, you know, like when you hit, let's say you flick your friend on the head,

732
01:03:08.46 --> 01:03:09.46
joking around, right?

733
01:03:09.46 --> 01:03:10.46
You flick them on the head.

734
01:03:10.46 --> 01:03:11.46
Good joke.

735
01:03:11.46 --> 01:03:11.46
Yeah.

736
01:03:11.46 --> 01:03:13.46
Then your friends like should be a trick.

737
01:03:13.46 --> 01:03:14.78
It feels like, hey, that's kind of hard.

738
01:03:14.78 --> 01:03:16.26
You know, so he like flick.

739
01:03:16.26 --> 01:03:17.46
You're just going to super hard.

740
01:03:17.46 --> 01:03:20.66
And you're like, hey, I didn't flick you on the head that hard.

741
01:03:20.66 --> 01:03:21.66
So you smack him.

742
01:03:21.66 --> 01:03:25.82
You know, and it turns into his big fight and who's who's to blame, right?

743
01:03:25.82 --> 01:03:26.82
Yeah.

744
01:03:26.82 --> 01:03:27.82
Both guys feel like, hey, I flick.

745
01:03:27.82 --> 01:03:28.82
You're just joking.

746
01:03:28.82 --> 01:03:29.82
You're not to flick me that hard.

747
01:03:29.82 --> 01:03:31.10
The other guy's like, why'd you flick me the first?

748
01:03:31.10 --> 01:03:32.10
But you don't kind of think.

749
01:03:32.10 --> 01:03:34.86
So, and I'm not saying that that's what happened.

750
01:03:34.86 --> 01:03:37.46
But in his mind, that's probably what it feels like.

751
01:03:37.46 --> 01:03:38.98
Oh, for sure, that's what it feels like.

752
01:03:38.98 --> 01:03:40.10
For sure, that's what it feels like.

753
01:03:40.10 --> 01:03:43.18
And we all can feel like that at one time or another.

754
01:03:43.18 --> 01:03:45.82
We think, oh, it's this person's fault.

755
01:03:45.82 --> 01:03:47.26
It's that person's fault.

756
01:03:47.26 --> 01:03:48.58
It's my parents.

757
01:03:48.58 --> 01:03:50.10
It's the school system.

758
01:03:50.10 --> 01:03:51.30
It's the whatever.

759
01:03:51.30 --> 01:03:54.50
It's society, right?

760
01:03:54.50 --> 01:03:56.54
It's society.

761
01:03:56.54 --> 01:03:58.14
It's every other human being.

762
01:03:58.14 --> 01:03:59.86
Like that's where he's at right now.

763
01:03:59.86 --> 01:04:01.86
He hated everyone I saw.

764
01:04:01.86 --> 01:04:02.86
That's where he's at.

765
01:04:02.86 --> 01:04:04.14
So he's like, he's the victim.

766
01:04:04.14 --> 01:04:05.14
And he's the victim.

767
01:04:05.14 --> 01:04:08.86
And he just just listened to, I mean, it's so clear when he's talking about all these

768
01:04:08.86 --> 01:04:12.26
medical problems that he's the victim.

769
01:04:12.26 --> 01:04:13.26
He's the victim.

770
01:04:13.26 --> 01:04:18.18
Or as if he would have just swapped his attitude early on and said, okay, what about

771
01:04:18.18 --> 01:04:19.50
what's happening right now?

772
01:04:19.50 --> 01:04:22.54
Even the first, why did he get, why did he get sent to the state penetrator, or

773
01:04:22.54 --> 01:04:24.18
it's in the state school system?

774
01:04:24.18 --> 01:04:29.62
Because he stole a gun ran away, ripped off a family of their stuff.

775
01:04:29.62 --> 01:04:31.38
Like, oh, if you do that, you go to prison.

776
01:04:31.38 --> 01:04:32.38
But he didn't see that.

777
01:04:32.38 --> 01:04:33.38
This is fault.

778
01:04:33.38 --> 01:04:34.38
That wasn't his fault.

779
01:04:34.38 --> 01:04:36.38
He did that because he was living in a bad home.

780
01:04:36.38 --> 01:04:40.82
It's like, okay, at some point you have to take ownership of what's going on in your

781
01:04:40.82 --> 01:04:41.82
world.

782
01:04:41.82 --> 01:04:45.06
And you can't just continually blame other people.

783
01:04:45.06 --> 01:04:51.90
If you do, eventually, you know who's at fault, everyone in the world but you.

784
01:04:51.90 --> 01:04:52.90
So let's not get there.

785
01:04:52.90 --> 01:04:56.06
I'll tell you what, it's a pretty good transition for when I joined the Navy.

786
01:04:56.06 --> 01:04:59.46
That's one thing that I've talked about how when I joined the Navy it's like a clean

787
01:04:59.46 --> 01:05:00.46
slate.

788
01:05:00.46 --> 01:05:01.46
You know what I mean?

789
01:05:01.46 --> 01:05:02.22
It doesn't matter what you did.

790
01:05:02.22 --> 01:05:08.50
And that was a really positive thing for me because all of a sudden, and it's a very

791
01:05:08.50 --> 01:05:13.26
cause and effect when you go through like Navy boot camp or any kind of boot camp, any

792
01:05:13.26 --> 01:05:17.74
kind of military and nocturnation, if you don't do what you're supposed to do, you get

793
01:05:17.74 --> 01:05:19.18
punished for it.

794
01:05:19.18 --> 01:05:22.98
If you do what you're supposed to do, you either A, don't get punished at a minimum, or

795
01:05:22.98 --> 01:05:25.34
you get some type of reward.

796
01:05:25.34 --> 01:05:27.46
And it's all set up that way, purposely.

797
01:05:27.46 --> 01:05:32.46
But it's very easy, it was very easy for me to comprehend as a 18 year old kid going,

798
01:05:32.46 --> 01:05:37.46
oh, if I, if I do this right, I will be rewarded.

799
01:05:37.46 --> 01:05:41.86
If I do this wrong, I will be punished.

800
01:05:41.86 --> 01:05:43.02
This is on me.

801
01:05:43.02 --> 01:05:49.54
And then what you, then the next thing that they build on top of that is, if I let my team

802
01:05:49.54 --> 01:05:53.26
do something wrong, we will all get punished.

803
01:05:53.26 --> 01:05:57.82
If we do things correctly, we will receive a minimum no punishment and possibly some

804
01:05:57.82 --> 01:05:59.06
type of reward.

805
01:05:59.06 --> 01:06:03.82
It was very easy for me to assemble those pieces in my young brain.

806
01:06:03.82 --> 01:06:08.58
And let's face it when you're 18 years old, I mean, my brain wasn't all that developed.

807
01:06:08.58 --> 01:06:09.58
Right?

808
01:06:09.58 --> 01:06:13.86
I mean, like physiologically speaking, the, the, the mail, like what is it?

809
01:06:13.86 --> 01:06:18.34
The mail frontal cortex isn't fully formed until like 25, right?

810
01:06:18.34 --> 01:06:19.34
Didn't you tell me that?

811
01:06:19.34 --> 01:06:20.34
Yes.

812
01:06:20.34 --> 01:06:21.34
Yeah.

813
01:06:21.34 --> 01:06:22.34
So there you go.

814
01:06:22.34 --> 01:06:25.30
And I, yet, was able to figure out, okay, wait a second.

815
01:06:25.30 --> 01:06:28.70
If I do this, it's on me.

816
01:06:28.70 --> 01:06:30.50
If I get punished, it's my fault.

817
01:06:30.50 --> 01:06:32.30
If our team gets punished.

818
01:06:32.30 --> 01:06:35.54
And again, that's a, that's a little jump there that kind of bring you through that little

819
01:06:35.54 --> 01:06:38.90
phase of like, okay, we get, now you're responsible for you.

820
01:06:38.90 --> 01:06:39.90
You understand that?

821
01:06:39.90 --> 01:06:43.10
And once you understand that's like, okay, now you're responsible for your team.

822
01:06:43.10 --> 01:06:44.58
And some people don't make that transition.

823
01:06:44.58 --> 01:06:48.42
Some people, you know, within the team, oh, it wasn't my fault.

824
01:06:48.42 --> 01:06:50.10
It was Jimmy's fault.

825
01:06:50.10 --> 01:06:51.10
Yeah.

826
01:06:51.10 --> 01:06:56.46
And as you stay in the military longer or as you go in any workforce, eventually you realize,

827
01:06:56.46 --> 01:07:00.82
okay, if we don't, if I don't work as a team, we're all going to get punished.

828
01:07:00.82 --> 01:07:01.82
Yeah.

829
01:07:01.82 --> 01:07:04.46
So I need to help the team.

830
01:07:04.46 --> 01:07:05.82
He's not learning any of this.

831
01:07:05.82 --> 01:07:07.22
No, no, he's that helping me.

832
01:07:07.22 --> 01:07:08.22
That's awful.

833
01:07:08.22 --> 01:07:10.22
Oh.

834
01:07:10.22 --> 01:07:11.86
Back to the book.

835
01:07:11.86 --> 01:07:16.34
My whole mind was bent on figuring out ways to annoy and punish my enemies and everybody

836
01:07:16.34 --> 01:07:17.34
was my enemy.

837
01:07:17.34 --> 01:07:18.66
I had no friends.

838
01:07:18.66 --> 01:07:22.46
I was the frame of mind I was in when my five years was up and I was turned loose to go

839
01:07:22.46 --> 01:07:23.86
anywhere I wanted to go.

840
01:07:23.86 --> 01:07:29.86
My intention was to rob rape and kill everybody I could, anybody and everybody.

841
01:07:29.86 --> 01:07:38.42
And he goes through these long kind of plans of putting bombs inside tunnels and how

842
01:07:38.42 --> 01:07:43.22
to get a gas mask, he was going to poison gas and he was going to steal so much money.

843
01:07:43.22 --> 01:07:48.06
And then with this, with this bunch of money that he was going to get from robbing all

844
01:07:48.06 --> 01:07:56.10
these people in this plot that he has with that, he says, with unlimited funds in my hands,

845
01:07:56.10 --> 01:07:59.42
I then intended to steal millions of dollars and kill millions of people.

846
01:07:59.42 --> 01:08:03.86
This I intended to do by starting a war between England and the USA.

847
01:08:03.86 --> 01:08:05.58
Sounds fantastical right, but I'm positive.

848
01:08:05.58 --> 01:08:06.58
He could have done it.

849
01:08:06.58 --> 01:08:09.10
He goes through his whole plot of how he was going to make that happen.

850
01:08:09.10 --> 01:08:12.94
He was going to bomb a British ship that was, you know, like, he or peacefully.

851
01:08:12.94 --> 01:08:18.18
Bomb it and make it look like America did it, what, when diplomatic relationship for already

852
01:08:18.18 --> 01:08:19.38
strained, that was his plan.

853
01:08:19.38 --> 01:08:20.78
It's crazy.

854
01:08:20.78 --> 01:08:25.26
I used to spend all my time figuring out how I could murder the most people with the least

855
01:08:25.26 --> 01:08:26.74
harm and expense to myself.

856
01:08:26.74 --> 01:08:31.74
And I finally thought of a way to kill off the whole town men, women, children and even

857
01:08:31.74 --> 01:08:32.74
cats and dogs.

858
01:08:32.74 --> 01:08:38.94
And he goes through another big plan about using arsenic and dead hogs and put them in the

859
01:08:38.94 --> 01:08:47.58
water splim, he goes through like detailed plants.

860
01:08:47.58 --> 01:08:56.46
Now this was some interesting, his perception of what it was like he's back in jail again.

861
01:08:56.46 --> 01:08:58.66
And I forget what for this time.

862
01:08:58.66 --> 01:09:03.02
But for all this crap that he's doing all the time, all these crimes he's committing,

863
01:09:03.02 --> 01:09:06.26
back to the book, the underworld code is very simple.

864
01:09:06.26 --> 01:09:08.22
It is never squeal.

865
01:09:08.22 --> 01:09:11.10
Don't be a stool pigeon or rat on in former.

866
01:09:11.10 --> 01:09:14.90
All crooks want everybody else to believe that they are square.

867
01:09:14.90 --> 01:09:16.10
Cops are the same.

868
01:09:16.10 --> 01:09:20.78
They all wish everybody else to think they act from principle.

869
01:09:20.78 --> 01:09:24.18
They're always telling everyone they need about how much principle they have.

870
01:09:24.18 --> 01:09:26.42
It is against their principle to do this or that.

871
01:09:26.42 --> 01:09:31.10
The queer part of it is that they not only want others to believe this, but they believe

872
01:09:31.10 --> 01:09:34.34
it themselves.

873
01:09:34.34 --> 01:09:38.62
But the real truth of the matter is that they deceive themselves and mistake policy for

874
01:09:38.62 --> 01:09:40.62
principle.

875
01:09:40.62 --> 01:09:47.02
When crooks are square with anyone, it is because it is for their own interest to be.

876
01:09:47.02 --> 01:09:50.18
So it is good policy.

877
01:09:50.18 --> 01:09:54.82
When it ceases to be in their own interest to square with another one, then it becomes

878
01:09:54.82 --> 01:09:59.26
time to change their tactics and they aren't slowing doing it either.

879
01:09:59.26 --> 01:10:02.90
It makes no difference to them who they snitch on no matter if they have been loyal to each

880
01:10:02.90 --> 01:10:05.42
other through a whole lifetime as partners and friends.

881
01:10:05.42 --> 01:10:11.18
No matter if they send their friends to prison or to hell by way of rope or chair, that

882
01:10:11.18 --> 01:10:12.58
cuts no ice.

883
01:10:12.58 --> 01:10:18.82
They are looking out for their own precious skins.

884
01:10:18.82 --> 01:10:28.06
Now this is a guy also that doesn't trust anybody.

885
01:10:28.06 --> 01:10:33.54
And that is actually what he said.

886
01:10:33.54 --> 01:10:37.86
You can say that about a lot of people, but there are all kinds of criminals that never

887
01:10:37.86 --> 01:10:41.50
give up the never giving up on his names.

888
01:10:41.50 --> 01:10:43.06
Never rat on anybody else.

889
01:10:43.06 --> 01:10:47.34
And they get the book thrown out of him and they take it.

890
01:10:47.34 --> 01:10:48.34
Back to the book.

891
01:10:48.34 --> 01:10:49.90
Every child has this is interesting.

892
01:10:49.90 --> 01:10:52.22
Every child has some criminal tendencies.

893
01:10:52.22 --> 01:10:56.46
It is your place to correct those traits and teach them the right way to live while they

894
01:10:56.46 --> 01:10:59.34
are young and their minds are forming.

895
01:10:59.34 --> 01:11:04.06
Then when they reach the age of reason and action, it will be quite natural for them

896
01:11:04.06 --> 01:11:10.02
to live clean, upright, honorable lives in that way you will stop crime at its source

897
01:11:10.02 --> 01:11:14.30
before it begins.

898
01:11:14.30 --> 01:11:17.34
As a child, a child is very easily led.

899
01:11:17.34 --> 01:11:22.30
Any child that properly taught will live the way he is taught to live.

900
01:11:22.30 --> 01:11:26.42
All criminals are merely overgrown children.

901
01:11:26.42 --> 01:11:29.14
It is in your hands to make us or break us.

902
01:11:29.14 --> 01:11:33.22
We buy our own efforts, our failures in life simply because we don't know any better.

903
01:11:33.22 --> 01:11:35.66
We don't know how to live decent upright lives.

904
01:11:35.66 --> 01:11:40.66
Hereditary, heredity has it very little to do with the shaping of our lives.

905
01:11:40.66 --> 01:11:46.86
The main causes of why we are, what we are is because of our improper teaching, lack of knowledge

906
01:11:46.86 --> 01:11:50.50
and our environment.

907
01:11:50.50 --> 01:11:53.18
Every man's philosophy is colored by his environment.

908
01:11:53.18 --> 01:11:57.30
If you don't want us to rob rape and murder you, then it is your place to see that the

909
01:11:57.30 --> 01:12:01.82
mental and moral misfits are properly taught a sufficient amount of useful and sensible

910
01:12:01.82 --> 01:12:06.74
knowledge to put their proper and put into the proper environment where they can be best

911
01:12:06.74 --> 01:12:10.54
fitted to exist in life.

912
01:12:10.54 --> 01:12:11.54
So there you go.

913
01:12:11.54 --> 01:12:15.94
The nature of nurture, argument, pans ram, all nurture.

914
01:12:15.94 --> 01:12:19.66
It's all how you raise.

915
01:12:19.66 --> 01:12:22.22
He goes on, I was born a normal human being.

916
01:12:22.22 --> 01:12:26.54
My parents were ignorant and through their improper teachings and improper environment

917
01:12:26.54 --> 01:12:30.26
I was gradually led into the wrong way of living.

918
01:12:30.26 --> 01:12:35.46
Little by little from Brad Badd to worse, I was sent to reform school at age 11.

919
01:12:35.46 --> 01:12:42.02
From that day to this, all of my life has been lived among moral and mental misfits.

920
01:12:42.02 --> 01:12:46.82
All my associates, all my surroundings, the atmosphere of deceit, treachery, brutality,

921
01:12:46.82 --> 01:12:53.30
degeneracy, hypocrisy and everything that is bad and nothing that is good.

922
01:12:53.30 --> 01:12:57.62
It is unnatural that I should have absorbed these things and I have become what I am today.

923
01:12:57.62 --> 01:13:04.02
A treacherous, degenerate brutal, savage human, devoid of all decent feeling, absolutely

924
01:13:04.02 --> 01:13:10.86
without conscience, moral, pity, sympathy, principle, or any single good trait.

925
01:13:10.86 --> 01:13:12.30
Why am I what I am?

926
01:13:12.30 --> 01:13:13.30
I'll tell you why.

927
01:13:13.30 --> 01:13:15.82
I did not make myself what I am.

928
01:13:15.82 --> 01:13:24.82
Others had the making of me.

929
01:13:24.82 --> 01:13:28.38
Everyone else is fault.

930
01:13:28.38 --> 01:13:33.06
And I am not in the power to control it.

931
01:13:33.06 --> 01:13:41.14
At this point, he recognizes what he is but he doesn't make any effort to reform himself.

932
01:13:41.14 --> 01:13:48.90
It is kind of those two, even with extreme ownership, working with a team, when you say

933
01:13:48.90 --> 01:13:53.10
it is easy to blame others.

934
01:13:53.10 --> 01:13:58.18
And especially when it is their fault at certain times, it is like their fault that this

935
01:13:58.18 --> 01:13:59.98
happened to that happen.

936
01:13:59.98 --> 01:14:00.98
It is like a philosophy.

937
01:14:00.98 --> 01:14:03.98
It is like a approach.

938
01:14:03.98 --> 01:14:04.98
It is a certain approach.

939
01:14:04.98 --> 01:14:10.02
You say, okay, you don't want to do their fault that this happened or whatever.

940
01:14:10.02 --> 01:14:13.98
It is really hard to come up with a situation when you are a leader of a team and it is

941
01:14:13.98 --> 01:14:15.38
the team's fault.

942
01:14:15.38 --> 01:14:18.58
I haven't been able to come up with one lightly.

943
01:14:18.58 --> 01:14:19.58
Yeah, yeah.

944
01:14:19.58 --> 01:14:21.58
To say it is maybe you can.

945
01:14:21.58 --> 01:14:27.06
Let's not say what I am saying is it is, okay, we will go with this guy.

946
01:14:27.06 --> 01:14:29.34
A guy on Twitter.

947
01:14:29.34 --> 01:14:34.06
He said, hey man, why are you giving all this hate to the machine gun or shoot outside

948
01:14:34.06 --> 01:14:35.06
their field of fire?

949
01:14:35.06 --> 01:14:40.54
That example a lot.

950
01:14:40.54 --> 01:14:41.98
That is the machine gun is fault right?

951
01:14:41.98 --> 01:14:42.98
No.

952
01:14:42.98 --> 01:14:47.70
I said do, hey man, I hate the officers that blame the machine gun or when the machine

953
01:14:47.70 --> 01:14:49.86
gun doesn't know where it is supposed to be shooting.

954
01:14:49.86 --> 01:14:51.46
That is the machine gun is fault.

955
01:14:51.46 --> 01:14:53.58
That is your fault boss.

956
01:14:53.58 --> 01:14:58.18
So, continue on about the situation that you are trying to do.

957
01:14:58.18 --> 01:15:00.78
This is a typical little thing that I will hear from people.

958
01:15:00.78 --> 01:15:03.58
It is like, wow, sometimes I take ownership of it.

959
01:15:03.58 --> 01:15:05.86
That is what you think you are wrong.

960
01:15:05.86 --> 01:15:06.86
Yeah, not wrong.

961
01:15:06.86 --> 01:15:13.94
I did it, but because right now I am not saying about who's fault it is.

962
01:15:13.94 --> 01:15:16.66
That is not the point I am trying to make.

963
01:15:16.66 --> 01:15:18.10
It is more that he is right.

964
01:15:18.10 --> 01:15:20.10
It is because of them.

965
01:15:20.10 --> 01:15:23.74
They or the way his parents raised him did cause him to be like this.

966
01:15:23.74 --> 01:15:26.10
It caused him to be like this.

967
01:15:26.10 --> 01:15:31.82
It caused him to be like, it didn't like his parents raised him, didn't make him, you

968
01:15:31.82 --> 01:15:34.42
know, satimize that kid or whatever.

969
01:15:34.42 --> 01:15:39.64
They didn't make him do it, but they are raised the way they raised him caused him, just

970
01:15:39.64 --> 01:15:42.58
cause an effect straight up, cause him to be like that.

971
01:15:42.58 --> 01:15:43.58
What I am quote.

972
01:15:43.58 --> 01:15:45.58
No, it is his fault.

973
01:15:45.58 --> 01:15:49.02
Yes, it is his fault that he is doing all these things.

974
01:15:49.02 --> 01:15:50.98
Because you can just not, you can not do it.

975
01:15:50.98 --> 01:15:54.94
That is possible to just not do it that day or at all whatever.

976
01:15:54.94 --> 01:15:57.30
So yeah, his first fault in blaming yes.

977
01:15:57.30 --> 01:15:59.30
You are going to Sam Harris free will on me.

978
01:15:59.30 --> 01:16:06.74
No, the thing is I mean, I guess what I am saying is like if you don't go to the lack

979
01:16:06.74 --> 01:16:07.74
of free will.

980
01:16:07.74 --> 01:16:08.74
Yeah, lack of free will.

981
01:16:08.74 --> 01:16:10.82
No, well, not necessarily.

982
01:16:10.82 --> 01:16:15.30
I am just basically isolating the blaming part of it and then the cause and effect part

983
01:16:15.30 --> 01:16:17.18
of it, you know, kind of thing.

984
01:16:17.18 --> 01:16:22.22
Because in that case he is right, like what he is saying is correct, as long as he is

985
01:16:22.22 --> 01:16:24.94
not saying and it is their fault and it is not my fault.

986
01:16:24.94 --> 01:16:25.94
I am not, you know what?

987
01:16:25.94 --> 01:16:26.94
He is saying that.

988
01:16:26.94 --> 01:16:27.94
Yes, okay.

989
01:16:27.94 --> 01:16:29.94
So push that aside.

990
01:16:29.94 --> 01:16:30.94
He is right in my sense.

991
01:16:30.94 --> 01:16:31.94
I am.

992
01:16:31.94 --> 01:16:32.94
What I am.

993
01:16:32.94 --> 01:16:34.94
Others had to make you make everyone else's fault.

994
01:16:34.94 --> 01:16:35.94
That I am like this.

995
01:16:35.94 --> 01:16:38.94
Yeah, that is not extremely true.

996
01:16:38.94 --> 01:16:39.94
No.

997
01:16:39.94 --> 01:16:43.94
But go cause an effect on him.

998
01:16:43.94 --> 01:16:44.94
Here's my point.

999
01:16:44.94 --> 01:16:45.94
Here's my point.

1000
01:16:45.94 --> 01:16:47.94
Because this is not, this is a gray area, right?

1001
01:16:47.94 --> 01:16:48.94
From the gray area.

1002
01:16:48.94 --> 01:16:50.94
Here's the problem.

1003
01:16:50.94 --> 01:16:57.14
If he looks at it, if he only lends that he looks at it through is this is everyone

1004
01:16:57.14 --> 01:17:01.14
else's fault and he's not to blame, then guess what?

1005
01:17:01.14 --> 01:17:03.62
He's not going to make any changes.

1006
01:17:03.62 --> 01:17:08.74
If he had a little bit, if he just looked at the situation and said, you know what?

1007
01:17:08.74 --> 01:17:11.90
All these things happened.

1008
01:17:11.90 --> 01:17:15.14
But some of this is cause of me.

1009
01:17:15.14 --> 01:17:20.26
Some of this is cause the actions that I have taken and I can now change my behavior.

1010
01:17:20.26 --> 01:17:24.58
So I don't stay in this mode of operating right now.

1011
01:17:24.58 --> 01:17:26.06
That's the difference.

1012
01:17:26.06 --> 01:17:28.02
And he never makes that change.

1013
01:17:28.02 --> 01:17:30.02
He never makes that different.

1014
01:17:30.02 --> 01:17:31.82
He never sees it that way.

1015
01:17:31.82 --> 01:17:36.22
The only thing he sees is that it's everyone else's fault.

1016
01:17:36.22 --> 01:17:38.10
And when you, this is the thing.

1017
01:17:38.10 --> 01:17:40.90
He go, you can see it gradually increases.

1018
01:17:40.90 --> 01:17:46.50
He's going from like, oh, I just hate this teachers and I just hate the wargons and eventually

1019
01:17:46.50 --> 01:17:50.38
he hates everybody because it's everyone else's fault.

1020
01:17:50.38 --> 01:17:53.10
Even people who doesn't even know cause they're a member of the human race.

1021
01:17:53.10 --> 01:17:54.10
He hates them.

1022
01:17:54.10 --> 01:17:55.10
Yeah.

1023
01:17:55.10 --> 01:17:58.42
That's why I personal responsibility.

1024
01:17:58.42 --> 01:18:00.38
So important to teach the kids.

1025
01:18:00.38 --> 01:18:05.26
Yes, so important to teach the kids.

1026
01:18:05.26 --> 01:18:06.78
And that's one thing I think I learned.

1027
01:18:06.78 --> 01:18:11.66
I mean, obviously I got some of it from my parents, but it was really crystal clear when

1028
01:18:11.66 --> 01:18:14.58
I came in the military because it's black and white.

1029
01:18:14.58 --> 01:18:15.58
The gray area's gone.

1030
01:18:15.58 --> 01:18:19.02
When you go through some kind of military and auctionation, the gray area is gone.

1031
01:18:19.02 --> 01:18:20.02
You mess this up.

1032
01:18:20.02 --> 01:18:21.02
It's your fault.

1033
01:18:21.02 --> 01:18:22.02
You're going to get punished for it.

1034
01:18:22.02 --> 01:18:23.02
Yeah.

1035
01:18:23.02 --> 01:18:24.02
We still get guys right?

1036
01:18:24.02 --> 01:18:28.06
That first, first, first, true sergeant is right in here, whatever.

1037
01:18:28.06 --> 01:18:29.94
You know, Billy should have done this.

1038
01:18:29.94 --> 01:18:31.22
Jones should have done that.

1039
01:18:31.22 --> 01:18:32.78
It's like, okay, but it doesn't matter.

1040
01:18:32.78 --> 01:18:33.78
Yeah, pay the man.

1041
01:18:33.78 --> 01:18:34.78
Just sit back.

1042
01:18:34.78 --> 01:18:38.02
Back to the book.

1043
01:18:38.02 --> 01:18:42.74
I have only a little knowledge, but I have as much intelligence as the average person and

1044
01:18:42.74 --> 01:18:45.06
I know I was taught wrong.

1045
01:18:45.06 --> 01:18:46.26
I could have been taught properly.

1046
01:18:46.26 --> 01:18:52.22
And if I had been, I sure feel I would have led a far different life than I have done.

1047
01:18:52.22 --> 01:18:55.78
You are to blame more so than I.

1048
01:18:55.78 --> 01:18:56.78
Straight up.

1049
01:18:56.78 --> 01:18:57.78
Straight up.

1050
01:18:57.78 --> 01:18:58.78
You.

1051
01:18:58.78 --> 01:18:59.78
He's talking to us.

1052
01:18:59.78 --> 01:19:03.82
It's not going to general human, the race of human beings.

1053
01:19:03.82 --> 01:19:04.86
That's my belief.

1054
01:19:04.86 --> 01:19:09.98
If you are going to go on teaching others as you have taught me, then you must suffer the same

1055
01:19:09.98 --> 01:19:16.74
as I.

1056
01:19:16.74 --> 01:19:17.74
Here we go.

1057
01:19:17.74 --> 01:19:21.62
He is at this point on trial.

1058
01:19:21.62 --> 01:19:27.42
This is from like I think this is one of the ones from a newspaper clipping or a report.

1059
01:19:27.42 --> 01:19:30.38
But it's another part.

1060
01:19:30.38 --> 01:19:32.34
This is, so this is in Panzeram's journal.

1061
01:19:32.34 --> 01:19:35.54
This is some of the additional information back to the book.

1062
01:19:35.54 --> 01:19:39.86
On the stand, Panzeram's eyes slid toward the table where his pistol and burglar tools

1063
01:19:39.86 --> 01:19:40.86
lay.

1064
01:19:40.86 --> 01:19:45.22
Prosecutor Collins whispered to an assistant who hurried over and removed the exhibits

1065
01:19:45.22 --> 01:19:47.62
to a safer place.

1066
01:19:47.62 --> 01:19:52.70
The arms of the witness chair disappeared under Panzeram's huge hands as he faced the

1067
01:19:52.70 --> 01:19:55.54
jury ignoring everyone else in the courtroom.

1068
01:19:55.54 --> 01:19:59.22
You people got me here charged with house breaking in larceny.

1069
01:19:59.22 --> 01:20:00.22
I'm guilty.

1070
01:20:00.22 --> 01:20:02.78
I broke in and I stole what I didn't steal.

1071
01:20:02.78 --> 01:20:03.78
I smashed.

1072
01:20:03.78 --> 01:20:08.50
If the owner would come home, I would have knocked his brains out.

1073
01:20:08.50 --> 01:20:12.42
Panzeram's eyes took on this strange depth as he watched the jury.

1074
01:20:12.42 --> 01:20:14.62
There's something else you ought to know.

1075
01:20:14.62 --> 01:20:18.66
Will you try me here? I was trying all of you too.

1076
01:20:18.66 --> 01:20:20.38
I found you guilty.

1077
01:20:20.38 --> 01:20:22.30
Some of you, I've executed.

1078
01:20:22.30 --> 01:20:24.86
If I live, I'll execute some more of you.

1079
01:20:24.86 --> 01:20:27.66
I hate the whole human race.

1080
01:20:27.66 --> 01:20:29.66
He said evenly.

1081
01:20:29.66 --> 01:20:31.42
A juror gasped.

1082
01:20:31.42 --> 01:20:37.50
Panzeram's round heads suddenly swung toward the prosecutor who looked alert and suspicious.

1083
01:20:37.50 --> 01:20:38.86
You think I'm playing crazy.

1084
01:20:38.86 --> 01:20:39.86
Don't you?

1085
01:20:39.86 --> 01:20:40.86
I'm not.

1086
01:20:40.86 --> 01:20:41.86
I know right from wrong.

1087
01:20:41.86 --> 01:20:42.86
No delusions.

1088
01:20:42.86 --> 01:20:45.54
I don't hear anything you don't hear.

1089
01:20:45.54 --> 01:20:47.26
My conscience doesn't bother me.

1090
01:20:47.26 --> 01:20:49.30
I have no conscience.

1091
01:20:49.30 --> 01:20:52.54
I believe the whole human race should be exterminated.

1092
01:20:52.54 --> 01:20:57.58
I'll do my best to do it every chance I get.

1093
01:20:57.58 --> 01:21:03.62
The court one was now numb as Panzeram turned to the jurors once more.

1094
01:21:03.62 --> 01:21:05.70
Now I've done my duty.

1095
01:21:05.70 --> 01:21:07.62
You do yours.

1096
01:21:07.62 --> 01:21:26.90
He gets along prison sentence and when he gets into prison, he actually kills one of the civilian

1097
01:21:26.90 --> 01:21:28.30
workers there in prison.

1098
01:21:28.30 --> 01:21:32.98
A guy that just was like a mate and a guy who runs the laundry.

1099
01:21:32.98 --> 01:21:40.62
He has a beef and kills him.

1100
01:21:40.62 --> 01:21:41.62
This is where we start.

1101
01:21:41.62 --> 01:21:42.62
This is one of the letters.

1102
01:21:42.62 --> 01:21:47.02
I talked about the guy Henry Lesser, who was a guard in one of the prisons he was in, who

1103
01:21:47.02 --> 01:21:48.02
formed a relationship.

1104
01:21:48.02 --> 01:21:51.82
He actually says a couple times that this is the only guy that didn't try and take something.

1105
01:21:51.82 --> 01:21:57.26
I think the whole thing started off a game like a dollar to buy cigarettes or whatever.

1106
01:21:57.26 --> 01:22:02.74
According to him, no one had ever done anything nice for Panzeram.

1107
01:22:02.74 --> 01:22:03.74
He's alive.

1108
01:22:03.74 --> 01:22:05.70
This guard was the first guy to do it.

1109
01:22:05.70 --> 01:22:10.58
He developed a relationship with him.

1110
01:22:10.58 --> 01:22:14.70
They go, they write letters back and forth.

1111
01:22:14.70 --> 01:22:18.74
Here's the excerpt of one of those many letters back to the book.

1112
01:22:18.74 --> 01:22:23.42
The real truth of the matter is that I haven't released desire to reform.

1113
01:22:23.42 --> 01:22:25.74
Very much the reverse of that is true.

1114
01:22:25.74 --> 01:22:30.30
I would not reform if the front gate was open right now.

1115
01:22:30.30 --> 01:22:35.14
And if I was given a million dollars when I stepped out, I have no desire to do good or

1116
01:22:35.14 --> 01:22:36.30
to be good.

1117
01:22:36.30 --> 01:22:41.18
I am just as mean now as I can be and the only reason I am no worse is because I lack

1118
01:22:41.18 --> 01:22:44.82
the power and the proper opportunity for meness.

1119
01:22:44.82 --> 01:22:49.58
If I had the power and the opportunities, then I would soon show you what real meanness

1120
01:22:49.58 --> 01:22:51.14
was.

1121
01:22:51.14 --> 01:22:54.94
You overlook the fact that the law and the great many people have been trying their

1122
01:22:54.94 --> 01:23:01.14
damnedest for 25 years to reform me.

1123
01:23:01.14 --> 01:23:04.18
I am tired of having people try to reform me.

1124
01:23:04.18 --> 01:23:06.58
What I want to do is reform them.

1125
01:23:06.58 --> 01:23:09.50
It took me 36 years to be like I am now.

1126
01:23:09.50 --> 01:23:13.90
Then how do you figure that I could if I wanted to change from black to white in the

1127
01:23:13.90 --> 01:23:25.78
twinkling of an eye?

1128
01:23:25.78 --> 01:23:28.38
Another letter.

1129
01:23:28.38 --> 01:23:29.38
Same theme.

1130
01:23:29.38 --> 01:23:31.14
I have no desire to reform under such conditions.

1131
01:23:31.14 --> 01:23:35.22
This would be required of me the way the laws of this country are today.

1132
01:23:35.22 --> 01:23:38.74
I do not care to live any longer if I must live in prison.

1133
01:23:38.74 --> 01:23:43.02
I would far rather die and go to hell if that's where people like me go after death.

1134
01:23:43.02 --> 01:23:48.34
I have very thoroughly considered this matter and I assure you now what I say is the truth.

1135
01:23:48.34 --> 01:23:54.78
I have confessed 21 different cold blooded premeditated murders, hundreds of cases of

1136
01:23:54.78 --> 01:23:59.66
arson, burglaries, robberies, rapes and other crimes.

1137
01:23:59.66 --> 01:24:05.74
The law has by this time looked them up and verified the truth of my various confessions.

1138
01:24:05.74 --> 01:24:11.50
My philosophy of life is such that very few people ever get and so deeply ingrained

1139
01:24:11.50 --> 01:24:15.26
and burned into me that I don't believe I could ever change my beliefs.

1140
01:24:15.26 --> 01:24:20.38
The things I have done to others, the things I have had done to me by others and the things

1141
01:24:20.38 --> 01:24:26.78
I have done to them can never be forgotten or forgiven either by me or others.

1142
01:24:26.78 --> 01:24:30.14
I can't forget and I won't forgive.

1143
01:24:30.14 --> 01:24:33.10
I couldn't if I wanted to.

1144
01:24:33.10 --> 01:24:38.38
The law is in the same fix.

1145
01:24:38.38 --> 01:24:43.74
My belief is that the life without liberty is not worth having.

1146
01:24:43.74 --> 01:24:45.94
If the law won't kill me, I shall kill myself.

1147
01:24:45.94 --> 01:24:50.14
I fully realize that I am not fit to live among people in a civilized community.

1148
01:24:50.14 --> 01:24:51.86
I have no desire to do so.

1149
01:24:51.86 --> 01:24:56.06
If I had any choice in living any longer, the only way I would consent to do so would be to

1150
01:24:56.06 --> 01:24:59.70
get clear out and away from all civilized people.

1151
01:24:59.70 --> 01:25:04.50
I am so set in my ways that I cannot adapt to myself to the ways of other people so that

1152
01:25:04.50 --> 01:25:12.66
the only way for me to do would be to live by myself without any human companionship, whatever.

1153
01:25:12.66 --> 01:25:25.78
He actually describes this island that he spent a little time on when he was down in South

1154
01:25:25.78 --> 01:25:26.78
America.

1155
01:25:26.78 --> 01:25:27.78
He's like, send me there.

1156
01:25:27.78 --> 01:25:32.14
If you want to send me somewhere.

1157
01:25:32.14 --> 01:25:37.02
Those back so now he'd killed that other guy, Warnke, the civilian, and now he's going

1158
01:25:37.02 --> 01:25:41.38
to trial for that murder.

1159
01:25:41.38 --> 01:25:48.54
And this is a newspaper report of that trial.

1160
01:25:48.54 --> 01:25:53.58
Back to the book, The Commission heard the hard-boiled giant tell of the fun which he received

1161
01:25:53.58 --> 01:25:54.58
and killing a man.

1162
01:25:54.58 --> 01:25:55.98
And there isn't a man in this room.

1163
01:25:55.98 --> 01:25:57.38
I wouldn't kill.

1164
01:25:57.38 --> 01:26:01.54
The cruel visage, steel-eyed man, told the commission.

1165
01:26:01.54 --> 01:26:02.54
I'm mad.

1166
01:26:02.54 --> 01:26:03.86
Plenty mad right now.

1167
01:26:03.86 --> 01:26:05.94
I don't believe there's any good in any man.

1168
01:26:05.94 --> 01:26:10.10
I'd like to have the opportunity to go away, gain power, and brains.

1169
01:26:10.10 --> 01:26:12.42
And then I'd like to kill off the rest of the world.

1170
01:26:12.42 --> 01:26:15.26
The convict said.

1171
01:26:15.26 --> 01:26:19.66
Dr. Perry asked the giant if he believed himself better than the rest of mankind.

1172
01:26:19.66 --> 01:26:21.46
Hell no, was it a reply.

1173
01:26:21.46 --> 01:26:24.86
I've checked up on myself lately and I know that I'm probably worse than the rest

1174
01:26:24.86 --> 01:26:25.86
of you.

1175
01:26:25.86 --> 01:26:27.06
I have no desire to live.

1176
01:26:27.06 --> 01:26:33.58
If you would hang me, my troubles would be over and I would be better off.

1177
01:26:33.58 --> 01:26:35.22
But don't you fear hellfire?

1178
01:26:35.22 --> 01:26:37.14
A member of the commission inquired?

1179
01:26:37.14 --> 01:26:40.34
You haven't been able to prove to me that there is such a thing.

1180
01:26:40.34 --> 01:26:41.86
Pan's ram answered.

1181
01:26:41.86 --> 01:26:47.30
The man boasted in court of killing 21 persons and vowed that when his parents living,

1182
01:26:47.30 --> 01:26:52.66
he would kill them, quote, for bringing me into the world.

1183
01:26:52.66 --> 01:26:55.34
There are two things in this world that count as powerful.

1184
01:26:55.34 --> 01:26:56.34
Money and knowledge.

1185
01:26:56.34 --> 01:26:57.34
You get enough money.

1186
01:26:57.34 --> 01:27:00.50
I would buy brains because brains are first sale.

1187
01:27:00.50 --> 01:27:04.58
I could get a brainy chemist and I would have them prepare me a lot of poison gas and

1188
01:27:04.58 --> 01:27:05.58
germs with these.

1189
01:27:05.58 --> 01:27:10.74
I would be able to exterminate a great mass of human beings that I would kill myself.

1190
01:27:10.74 --> 01:27:20.34
Society should build a great monument because I have never propagated my kind.

1191
01:27:20.34 --> 01:27:25.02
So that's what his little excerpt of what his trial was like.

1192
01:27:25.02 --> 01:27:26.02
You know, he was done.

1193
01:27:26.02 --> 01:27:30.14
I mean, he just did not care.

1194
01:27:30.14 --> 01:27:32.34
Back to the book, and this is the book itself.

1195
01:27:32.34 --> 01:27:36.10
The court convened again the next morning in the judge having been given no alternative

1196
01:27:36.10 --> 01:27:40.10
by the hard rural jury looked down at the defendant and pronounced him guilty with no

1197
01:27:40.10 --> 01:27:43.30
mention of life-saving phrase without capital punishment.

1198
01:27:43.30 --> 01:27:46.02
Pan's ram had nothing to say concerning the sentence.

1199
01:27:46.02 --> 01:27:50.70
Hopkins then ordered that he be remanded with to the care of the warden at the federal

1200
01:27:50.70 --> 01:27:56.22
penitentiary at Levinworth there to be confined until the fifth day of September when

1201
01:27:56.22 --> 01:28:00.14
between the hours of six and nine o'clock in the morning, you shall be taken to some

1202
01:28:00.14 --> 01:28:08.06
suitable place within the confines of the penitentiary and hanged by the neck until dead.

1203
01:28:08.06 --> 01:28:12.74
The judge then announced the 90 day interval to allow for any bill of objection and

1204
01:28:12.74 --> 01:28:15.34
appeal before the defense attorney could speak.

1205
01:28:15.34 --> 01:28:19.74
Pan's ram said swiftly, I don't want any attorney to file for a new trial or appeal

1206
01:28:19.74 --> 01:28:26.74
to anything I'm satisfied with the verdict.

1207
01:28:26.74 --> 01:28:34.62
So, while he's now on death row, there's a delegation of people that are against capital

1208
01:28:34.62 --> 01:28:40.30
punishment and they start fighting to get him off death row.

1209
01:28:40.30 --> 01:28:42.30
He writes them a letter.

1210
01:28:42.30 --> 01:28:44.18
Here's a little part of that letter.

1211
01:28:44.18 --> 01:28:48.74
On February 1st, 1929, I began serving this sentence at the U.S. Penitentiary at Levinworth

1212
01:28:48.74 --> 01:28:51.34
Kansas on June 20th, 1929.

1213
01:28:51.34 --> 01:28:57.26
I murdered one man, a civilian employee of the prison by the name of Wunky.

1214
01:28:57.26 --> 01:29:02.06
And at the same time in place, I also attempted to murder a dozen other men, both guards

1215
01:29:02.06 --> 01:29:03.06
and convicts.

1216
01:29:03.06 --> 01:29:08.10
The only reason I did not kill them was also because I couldn't catch them.

1217
01:29:08.10 --> 01:29:14.06
If I had given another trial or if the death sentence should be commuted to life in prison,

1218
01:29:14.06 --> 01:29:20.50
either in penitentiary or in insane asylum, it will be against my will.

1219
01:29:20.50 --> 01:29:24.02
And then he goes on to try to explain to them because he doesn't want them to think that

1220
01:29:24.02 --> 01:29:25.02
he's crazy.

1221
01:29:25.02 --> 01:29:29.42
Because if he's crazy, then he's not, he's going to get insane asylum or you know, reason

1222
01:29:29.42 --> 01:29:32.30
of insanity.

1223
01:29:32.30 --> 01:29:38.78
Back to the book, I shall try and convince you that I'm quite sane at this time.

1224
01:29:38.78 --> 01:29:42.66
I am at this time 38 years old, a big, powerful man, strong in both body and mind.

1225
01:29:42.66 --> 01:29:47.78
My physical fitness is not as good as it once was, but my mental facilities are unimperited

1226
01:29:47.78 --> 01:29:48.78
in any way.

1227
01:29:48.78 --> 01:29:51.86
I've never used drugs of any kind or any type.

1228
01:29:51.86 --> 01:29:56.98
I am, I am and always have been a very moderate drinker of liquor practically a total

1229
01:29:56.98 --> 01:29:58.22
abstainer.

1230
01:29:58.22 --> 01:30:03.86
I've never taken any disease of any kind which would have the tendency to weaken my intellect.

1231
01:30:03.86 --> 01:30:09.50
I've never been addicted to any habits of sexual accesses of any kind over which I didn't

1232
01:30:09.50 --> 01:30:13.10
have complete control of myself.

1233
01:30:13.10 --> 01:30:17.78
I choose to die here and now by being hanged by the neck until I'm dead.

1234
01:30:17.78 --> 01:30:19.86
I prefer that I die that way.

1235
01:30:19.86 --> 01:30:24.38
And if I have a soul and if that soul should burn in hell for a million years, still

1236
01:30:24.38 --> 01:30:28.82
I prefer that to a lingering, agonizing death and some prison dungeon or a padded cell

1237
01:30:28.82 --> 01:30:32.14
in a madhouse.

1238
01:30:32.14 --> 01:30:36.02
I do not believe that being hanged by the neck until dead is a barbaric or in human

1239
01:30:36.02 --> 01:30:37.02
punishment.

1240
01:30:37.02 --> 01:30:41.14
I look forward to it as a real pleasure and a big relief for me.

1241
01:30:41.14 --> 01:30:43.70
I do not feel bad or unhappy about it in any way.

1242
01:30:43.70 --> 01:30:46.42
Every day since I received that sentence I felt pretty good.

1243
01:30:46.42 --> 01:30:50.38
I feel good right now and I believe that when my last hour comes I will dance out of my

1244
01:30:50.38 --> 01:30:55.06
dungeon and onto the scaffold with a smile in my face and happiness in my heart.

1245
01:30:55.06 --> 01:30:59.18
Another reason why I believe this sentence should be carried out is because I believe

1246
01:30:59.18 --> 01:31:00.58
it is justice.

1247
01:31:00.58 --> 01:31:05.66
And I am quite sincere when I say that this is the first and only time in my life of battling

1248
01:31:05.66 --> 01:31:12.10
with the law that I ever did get justice from the law.

1249
01:31:12.10 --> 01:31:16.10
One other thing I am going to tell you before I stop this letter and that is this.

1250
01:31:16.10 --> 01:31:20.62
The only thanks that you or your kind will ever get for me for your efforts on my behalf

1251
01:31:20.62 --> 01:31:26.14
is that I wish you all had one neck and that I had my hands on it.

1252
01:31:26.14 --> 01:31:30.50
I would sure put you out of your misery just the same as I have done with numbers of other

1253
01:31:30.50 --> 01:31:33.82
people.

1254
01:31:33.82 --> 01:31:37.02
I have no desire whatever to reform myself.

1255
01:31:37.02 --> 01:31:41.50
My only desires to reform people who try to reform me and I believe that the only way

1256
01:31:41.50 --> 01:31:48.34
to do reform to people is to kill them.

1257
01:31:48.34 --> 01:31:55.02
My motto is rape a mall, rob a mall and kill a mall.

1258
01:31:55.02 --> 01:32:09.98
I am very truly yours, Carl Panzeram.

1259
01:32:09.98 --> 01:32:13.78
Another letter.

1260
01:32:13.78 --> 01:32:18.34
I think it was the next the last letter that he wrote to Lesser.

1261
01:32:18.34 --> 01:32:22.46
Henry Lesser, he says, I had no choice about coming into this world in nearly 38, nearly

1262
01:32:22.46 --> 01:32:27.86
all of my 38 years and it had very little to say and do about how I should live my life.

1263
01:32:27.86 --> 01:32:33.02
People have driven me into doing everything I have ever done.

1264
01:32:33.02 --> 01:32:36.14
Now the time has come when I refuse to be driven any further.

1265
01:32:36.14 --> 01:32:42.26
So again, I have only done what I have done because of what other people have done to me.

1266
01:32:42.26 --> 01:32:44.86
That is not on me.

1267
01:32:44.86 --> 01:32:48.22
Zero responsibility.

1268
01:32:48.22 --> 01:32:52.66
Everything I have ever done is because of other people.

1269
01:32:52.66 --> 01:32:55.02
Ever.

1270
01:32:55.02 --> 01:32:59.02
It is a slippery slope that you just tried to step on for a couple minutes ago.

1271
01:32:59.02 --> 01:33:02.50
Yes, it is actually in you thinking about it, aren't you?

1272
01:33:02.50 --> 01:33:06.54
Yeah, but I am not wrong.

1273
01:33:06.54 --> 01:33:08.18
Because I am not talking about the blame.

1274
01:33:08.18 --> 01:33:10.82
I am talking about causing a fact, but who is the thing?

1275
01:33:10.82 --> 01:33:11.82
No.

1276
01:33:11.82 --> 01:33:14.98
Causing a fact is kind of like that is easy to start blaming.

1277
01:33:14.98 --> 01:33:15.98
You got this.

1278
01:33:15.98 --> 01:33:18.98
You are saying technically.

1279
01:33:18.98 --> 01:33:20.98
I will split here as well.

1280
01:33:20.98 --> 01:33:26.94
Technically there is a difference.

1281
01:33:26.94 --> 01:33:31.94
My point is if you have the, I mean, I work with people all the time and this is the

1282
01:33:31.94 --> 01:33:38.70
most important transition that people make in their brain is whether you are a business

1283
01:33:38.70 --> 01:33:42.34
leader, whether you are talking about your personal life, whether you are talking about

1284
01:33:42.34 --> 01:33:45.14
the family, whatever you are talking about.

1285
01:33:45.14 --> 01:33:49.06
The transition that you make from doing what you are saying right now, which is like, well,

1286
01:33:49.06 --> 01:33:50.06
it is actually their fault.

1287
01:33:50.06 --> 01:33:52.86
That is in the back of your mind.

1288
01:33:52.86 --> 01:33:58.26
Okay, if that is in the back of your mind, like, okay, the problem is it grows.

1289
01:33:58.26 --> 01:33:59.94
The problem is you use that.

1290
01:33:59.94 --> 01:34:04.26
The problem is next thing you know, it is not just that, it is this, it is their fault.

1291
01:34:04.26 --> 01:34:05.50
And it is the other thing that is their fault.

1292
01:34:05.50 --> 01:34:06.50
And it is my team's fault.

1293
01:34:06.50 --> 01:34:08.74
And it is not my fault.

1294
01:34:08.74 --> 01:34:09.74
Yeah.

1295
01:34:09.74 --> 01:34:10.74
Yeah.

1296
01:34:10.74 --> 01:34:15.10
I mean, just to be clear though, I am not saying the fault part of the way.

1297
01:34:15.10 --> 01:34:19.86
The fault fault in the blaming, that part of it literally has nothing to do with it.

1298
01:34:19.86 --> 01:34:21.02
So what are you saying?

1299
01:34:21.02 --> 01:34:22.78
Causing effect, they are two different things.

1300
01:34:22.78 --> 01:34:24.66
Look, put it this way.

1301
01:34:24.66 --> 01:34:25.66
Okay.

1302
01:34:25.66 --> 01:34:31.90
And I used to kind of say this as a joke, where, I don't know, let's say I did something.

1303
01:34:31.90 --> 01:34:33.74
And then I'd be like, well, it is not my fault.

1304
01:34:33.74 --> 01:34:36.06
It is my parents fault for having me.

1305
01:34:36.06 --> 01:34:37.54
Oh, but it is their fault.

1306
01:34:37.54 --> 01:34:40.66
Actually, it is my grandparents fault for having them.

1307
01:34:40.66 --> 01:34:42.74
Oh, no, it is my great kind.

1308
01:34:42.74 --> 01:34:48.18
And you start just blaming every little factor that contributed to this result, every little

1309
01:34:48.18 --> 01:34:49.18
factor.

1310
01:34:49.18 --> 01:34:50.18
Yeah.

1311
01:34:50.18 --> 01:34:51.18
Here's it.

1312
01:34:51.18 --> 01:34:54.14
So basically to kind of break that apart, it is like, yeah, if my parents didn't have

1313
01:34:54.14 --> 01:34:55.14
me, this wouldn't happen.

1314
01:34:55.14 --> 01:34:56.14
It is true.

1315
01:34:56.14 --> 01:34:57.14
It is true.

1316
01:34:57.14 --> 01:35:03.10
But the thing is, you can't just start point blame as far as assigning blame goes.

1317
01:35:03.10 --> 01:35:07.74
I am not assigning blame if I am saying, hey, this is a factor or whatever, unless I am

1318
01:35:07.74 --> 01:35:09.74
doing it as a joke, you see what I am saying.

1319
01:35:09.74 --> 01:35:10.74
Okay.

1320
01:35:10.74 --> 01:35:17.02
So if when you do cross the line to start assigning blame, that's when you can't be like,

1321
01:35:17.02 --> 01:35:19.90
okay, it's everything else that you got to blame yourself.

1322
01:35:19.90 --> 01:35:21.66
But it's a you're not assigning blame.

1323
01:35:21.66 --> 01:35:25.30
You're just maybe analyzing it from an objective perspective.

1324
01:35:25.30 --> 01:35:30.90
So you can identify all kinds of causes, all kinds of causes.

1325
01:35:30.90 --> 01:35:31.90
Seems same.

1326
01:35:31.90 --> 01:35:34.06
And they're probably true.

1327
01:35:34.06 --> 01:35:38.18
But not having anything to do with causing blame or assigning blame or saying who's

1328
01:35:38.18 --> 01:35:39.18
fault it is.

1329
01:35:39.18 --> 01:35:40.18
Seems same.

1330
01:35:40.18 --> 01:35:48.98
Okay, it's just another example of how like you or we whatever, when I talk to you

1331
01:35:48.98 --> 01:35:53.78
a lot of the time, sometimes all you will take a scenario and I'll just sort of marvel

1332
01:35:53.78 --> 01:35:56.30
at different working parts of this scenario.

1333
01:35:56.30 --> 01:35:59.90
Like, oh, it's interesting how this is this and this is this, but you could do this and

1334
01:35:59.90 --> 01:36:02.02
look at it this way too.

1335
01:36:02.02 --> 01:36:04.06
Even though it has nothing to do with me.

1336
01:36:04.06 --> 01:36:06.94
You know, and it has nothing to do with any kind of actions to be taken or nothing

1337
01:36:06.94 --> 01:36:11.38
like that, it's essentially just analyzing the scenario and being interested in it.

1338
01:36:11.38 --> 01:36:15.14
Versus you, you always look at the scenario like, okay, yeah, cool.

1339
01:36:15.14 --> 01:36:16.14
That's cool.

1340
01:36:16.14 --> 01:36:17.42
You analyze it, but what do you do?

1341
01:36:17.42 --> 01:36:22.02
You know, your attitude is real take action kind of approach.

1342
01:36:22.02 --> 01:36:28.70
So I think that's where I think that's where we're getting some misfires.

1343
01:36:28.70 --> 01:36:29.70
Seems same.

1344
01:36:29.70 --> 01:36:36.82
I think that it's like, I want to base some action to be taken upon the way I'm looking

1345
01:36:36.82 --> 01:36:38.38
at it.

1346
01:36:38.38 --> 01:36:42.46
When it requires no actions, just the way to sort of look at it, you know?

1347
01:36:42.46 --> 01:36:44.90
But if you want to take action, like, okay, so who do we blame?

1348
01:36:44.90 --> 01:36:47.90
That's the beginning of taking action in a way.

1349
01:36:47.90 --> 01:36:48.90
Who do we blame?

1350
01:36:48.90 --> 01:36:49.90
What do we got to fix?

1351
01:36:49.90 --> 01:36:50.90
Who do we got to fix?

1352
01:36:50.90 --> 01:36:55.46
Whatever to move forward to fix a situation to whatever rectify it.

1353
01:36:55.46 --> 01:37:00.70
Then you got to be like, okay, I got to identify the problem that I can change.

1354
01:37:00.70 --> 01:37:03.26
And then, yeah, in that case, I know that problem is going to be yourself.

1355
01:37:03.26 --> 01:37:05.94
It's the best way.

1356
01:37:05.94 --> 01:37:07.98
And if it's not, then you're not going to solve anything.

1357
01:37:07.98 --> 01:37:08.98
Yeah.

1358
01:37:08.98 --> 01:37:09.98
You just consider on blame people.

1359
01:37:09.98 --> 01:37:10.98
Yeah.

1360
01:37:10.98 --> 01:37:13.50
But does that make sense?

1361
01:37:13.50 --> 01:37:16.98
Maybe.

1362
01:37:16.98 --> 01:37:17.98
I don't recommend it.

1363
01:37:17.98 --> 01:37:18.98
No, yeah.

1364
01:37:18.98 --> 01:37:19.98
That's the thing.

1365
01:37:19.98 --> 01:37:20.98
Yeah.

1366
01:37:20.98 --> 01:37:23.22
And again, even that was saying, I don't recommend it.

1367
01:37:23.22 --> 01:37:26.98
That's like, that's super indicative of just like, yeah, you don't recommend that as a

1368
01:37:26.98 --> 01:37:27.98
problem solving technique.

1369
01:37:27.98 --> 01:37:32.46
That's a, that's a, that's an take action approach right there.

1370
01:37:32.46 --> 01:37:34.58
It's the same.

1371
01:37:34.58 --> 01:37:39.62
It's kind of like if we came to a stop light and then the stop lights red and like, wow,

1372
01:37:39.62 --> 01:37:41.86
isn't that red stop light super nice?

1373
01:37:41.86 --> 01:37:44.74
Like, it's a beautiful color red.

1374
01:37:44.74 --> 01:37:47.90
And you're going to be like, yeah, like, but it means to stop.

1375
01:37:47.90 --> 01:37:48.90
So we're stopped.

1376
01:37:48.90 --> 01:37:52.10
I'm like, no, I know, but isn't it kind of beautiful?

1377
01:37:52.10 --> 01:37:53.10
And then it turns green.

1378
01:37:53.10 --> 01:37:55.62
Wow, isn't that a beautiful green light?

1379
01:37:55.62 --> 01:37:58.74
And you're like, yeah, but it means to go.

1380
01:37:58.74 --> 01:38:02.46
And I've been like, cool, but it's a pretty nice shade of green.

1381
01:38:02.46 --> 01:38:03.46
Seems same.

1382
01:38:03.46 --> 01:38:04.46
Seems same.

1383
01:38:04.46 --> 01:38:05.46
It's like two different perspectives.

1384
01:38:05.46 --> 01:38:06.46
Yeah.

1385
01:38:06.46 --> 01:38:08.66
And then, of course, you'd roll for the green light.

1386
01:38:08.66 --> 01:38:11.66
And, you know, I'd go get after it.

1387
01:38:11.66 --> 01:38:12.66
Yeah.

1388
01:38:12.66 --> 01:38:14.26
I'll leave that one at that.

1389
01:38:14.26 --> 01:38:15.26
All right.

1390
01:38:15.26 --> 01:38:20.74
Obviously, the attempts to save Carl Pandram were ceased.

1391
01:38:20.74 --> 01:38:30.18
And here's how his life ends according to this book at 11 worth.

1392
01:38:30.18 --> 01:38:34.06
The lights of the isolation had burned into a pale gray dawn on September 5th when

1393
01:38:34.06 --> 01:38:41.58
Pan's Ram heard the distant, distant rattle of footsteps who's not quite six o'clock.

1394
01:38:41.58 --> 01:38:46.54
Guard, belard, went over to the steel door leading to an outer corridor and peered through

1395
01:38:46.54 --> 01:38:48.50
the small barred window.

1396
01:38:48.50 --> 01:38:54.34
Gordon White's voice was heard and the guard turned a brass key in the lock.

1397
01:38:54.34 --> 01:38:59.18
The door swung open, white entered the isolation at the head of the procession of some

1398
01:38:59.18 --> 01:39:02.50
20 persons, including guards and newspaper reporters.

1399
01:39:02.50 --> 01:39:10.58
Immediately behind the warden was Marshall McEver McEver and the tall government hangman

1400
01:39:10.58 --> 01:39:14.46
carrying the leather harness over one arm.

1401
01:39:14.46 --> 01:39:18.86
And stopped in front of Pandram's cell.

1402
01:39:18.86 --> 01:39:22.82
The spectators pressed themselves discreetly against the opposite wall as Pan's Ram faced

1403
01:39:22.82 --> 01:39:28.46
them searching through the wire mesh with his hostile eyes.

1404
01:39:28.46 --> 01:39:34.06
He saw two men in clerical garb on the fringes of the crowd and it once began to roar

1405
01:39:34.06 --> 01:39:36.30
at white.

1406
01:39:36.30 --> 01:39:41.14
Are there any Bible-backed cock suckers in here?

1407
01:39:41.14 --> 01:39:44.50
I thought you might change your mind, white apologized.

1408
01:39:44.50 --> 01:39:48.50
These gentlemen came a long way to offer you comfort.

1409
01:39:48.50 --> 01:39:51.06
Get them out, shouted Pan's Ram.

1410
01:39:51.06 --> 01:39:55.38
I don't mind being hanged but I don't need any Bible-backed hypocrites around me.

1411
01:39:55.38 --> 01:40:00.14
Run them out, warden, or you'll have one hell of a time getting me out of this cell.

1412
01:40:00.14 --> 01:40:05.14
Every man I get a hand on is going to the hospital.

1413
01:40:05.14 --> 01:40:10.70
White New Pan's Ram was within a condemned man's traditional rights regarding witnesses

1414
01:40:10.70 --> 01:40:14.14
of his own execution.

1415
01:40:14.14 --> 01:40:17.62
The disappointed clergymen were escorted out.

1416
01:40:17.62 --> 01:40:20.14
All right, Pan's Ram said, let's get going.

1417
01:40:20.14 --> 01:40:22.58
What are we stalling for?

1418
01:40:22.58 --> 01:40:26.82
White motions, the guards and newsmen to proceed to the exercise yard as bothered to

1419
01:40:26.82 --> 01:40:30.22
opened Pan's Ram's cell.

1420
01:40:30.22 --> 01:40:35.70
Pan's Ram helped his escorts faster than fastened the leather corset.

1421
01:40:35.70 --> 01:40:39.62
Anything you want to say, ask the hangman fumbling with a strap.

1422
01:40:39.62 --> 01:40:41.18
Ram snapped impatiently.

1423
01:40:41.18 --> 01:40:44.38
Yes, hurry it up, you who's your bastard.

1424
01:40:44.38 --> 01:40:49.14
I could hang a dozen men while you're fooling around.

1425
01:40:49.14 --> 01:40:51.54
In the yard, the newsmen took heried notes.

1426
01:40:51.54 --> 01:40:54.90
The scaffold looked strange and somehow unexpected.

1427
01:40:54.90 --> 01:41:00.14
Do glistened on the boards that had the raw temporary look of a structure erected for

1428
01:41:00.14 --> 01:41:03.14
a county fair.

1429
01:41:03.14 --> 01:41:07.70
Unless then a minute, the backdoor of the isolation opened and Pan's Ram was emerged

1430
01:41:07.70 --> 01:41:09.74
between ballard and the hangman.

1431
01:41:09.74 --> 01:41:15.22
Pan's Ram was almost running ahead, half dragging the taller escorts.

1432
01:41:15.22 --> 01:41:19.54
White and the martial hurry behind, trailed by officers trying to look dignified as they

1433
01:41:19.54 --> 01:41:22.30
ran.

1434
01:41:22.30 --> 01:41:26.62
In the confusion, the spectators parted into two lines as they had processed as the

1435
01:41:26.62 --> 01:41:29.46
procession raised Palmell in their direction.

1436
01:41:29.46 --> 01:41:32.22
Pan's Ram's face was rigid and looked straight ahead.

1437
01:41:32.22 --> 01:41:35.54
His eyes fixed on the rope.

1438
01:41:35.54 --> 01:41:39.54
He had the foot of the stairs that he seemed to notice the transfixed onlookers.

1439
01:41:39.54 --> 01:41:45.14
He paused, looked slowly around and spat twice.

1440
01:41:45.14 --> 01:41:46.94
Then his face was forward again.

1441
01:41:46.94 --> 01:41:51.50
Everyone's nostrils inhaled the sweet smell of new oak and hemp and everyone's eyes

1442
01:41:51.50 --> 01:41:56.50
followed him up the 13 steps which he felt with his feet.

1443
01:41:56.50 --> 01:42:05.50
He hurried up the gallows, as toward the gate, pulling ballard and the hangman with him.

1444
01:42:05.50 --> 01:42:09.42
The reporters who had witnessed this event were surprised by its swiftness and their

1445
01:42:09.42 --> 01:42:14.22
accounts were in conflict as to the time and exact detail.

1446
01:42:14.22 --> 01:42:18.18
There was uncertainty as to whether Pan's Ram had been able to spit on the executioner

1447
01:42:18.18 --> 01:42:19.82
as he had promised he would.

1448
01:42:19.82 --> 01:42:24.64
The reporters know books hide, hung limp during the swift adjustment of the rope, the

1449
01:42:24.64 --> 01:42:31.62
exploding sound of the opening doors and the swift downward stroke of the body.

1450
01:42:31.62 --> 01:42:35.82
Later they recalled the mist which had settled on the guard and the indistinct figures

1451
01:42:35.82 --> 01:42:39.94
of guards watching from a tower on the wall.

1452
01:42:39.94 --> 01:42:46.74
The prison had been quiet, the first bell was not yet scheduled to ring for an hour.

1453
01:42:46.74 --> 01:42:51.70
Reporters had left the same way they came in and were relieved to find themselves outside

1454
01:42:51.70 --> 01:42:55.94
the walls.

1455
01:42:55.94 --> 01:43:00.18
Records of official entry regarding the death of Carl Pan's Ram are brief.

1456
01:43:00.18 --> 01:43:05.78
Dr. Justin K. Fuller, one of the two doctors in attendance step forward to the stretched

1457
01:43:05.78 --> 01:43:11.02
body underneath the gallows, placed a stethoscope gently on the chest and palpitated

1458
01:43:11.02 --> 01:43:13.22
the neck.

1459
01:43:13.22 --> 01:43:18.82
Later he dictated his report to a prison clerk.

1460
01:43:18.82 --> 01:43:22.34
Medical certificate of death, Carl Pan's Ram.

1461
01:43:22.34 --> 01:43:26.82
I hear by certified that I examine the body of Carl Pan's Ram in accordance with the

1462
01:43:26.82 --> 01:43:31.74
directions of the surgeon general of the U.S. Public Health Service and Attorney General.

1463
01:43:31.74 --> 01:43:37.54
At U.S. Penn at Tentry 11, Worth Kansas, on September 5, 1930, and pronounced him dead

1464
01:43:37.54 --> 01:43:41.38
at 6.18 AM.

1465
01:43:41.38 --> 01:43:54.98
I found the cause of death to be dislocation, cervical vertebra, strangulation, legal execution.

1466
01:43:54.98 --> 01:44:09.70
And so ended the life of Carl Pan's Ram on September 5, 1930, and while Pan's Ram died

1467
01:44:09.70 --> 01:44:18.22
evil as we see certainly did not die with him.

1468
01:44:18.22 --> 01:44:27.50
It still walks among us today.

1469
01:44:27.50 --> 01:44:41.18
And as we've been going back and forth on obviously Pan's Ram did not get many benefits in life.

1470
01:44:41.18 --> 01:44:48.18
That does not excuse his actions.

1471
01:44:48.18 --> 01:44:51.42
And we are responsible for what we do.

1472
01:44:51.42 --> 01:44:58.30
We are responsible for our lives and if someone's had horrible things happen to them, if

1473
01:44:58.30 --> 01:45:05.70
they've seen horrible things, if they've done horrible things.

1474
01:45:05.70 --> 01:45:12.22
It's still important that you don't become those horrible things that you don't propagate

1475
01:45:12.22 --> 01:45:19.38
those horrible things.

1476
01:45:19.38 --> 01:45:28.94
Instead be the hero, be the savior that absorbs those things, those horrible things, and

1477
01:45:28.94 --> 01:45:34.82
passes on good.

1478
01:45:34.82 --> 01:45:37.78
And you do that.

1479
01:45:37.78 --> 01:45:50.02
You do that by treating people with respect and being just kind to other human beings.

1480
01:45:50.02 --> 01:45:55.30
And it's one of those things that I thought about this one character, this Henry Lester,

1481
01:45:55.30 --> 01:46:01.66
this guard, this the first person that Pan's Ram ever thought did something nice to him.

1482
01:46:01.66 --> 01:46:02.66
And who knows?

1483
01:46:02.66 --> 01:46:13.34
What happened earlier, maybe could have been a teacher at the state school.

1484
01:46:13.34 --> 01:46:22.50
Maybe that's what tips someone towards the good.

1485
01:46:22.50 --> 01:46:23.50
Are you that person?

1486
01:46:23.50 --> 01:46:30.98
Can you be that person that's swathes someone from doing evil, doing good simply through

1487
01:46:30.98 --> 01:46:39.94
some sympathetic words, some compassionate gesture?

1488
01:46:39.94 --> 01:46:40.94
Think about that.

1489
01:46:40.94 --> 01:46:46.58
Might be that person.

1490
01:46:46.58 --> 01:46:48.90
I might be that person.

1491
01:46:48.90 --> 01:47:00.94
We might be that person that sets the good example by being nice, by being kind.

1492
01:47:00.94 --> 01:47:04.06
And here's the dichotomy.

1493
01:47:04.06 --> 01:47:11.30
At the same time, you got to be strong enough to stand up to people that think might

1494
01:47:11.30 --> 01:47:15.42
make right.

1495
01:47:15.42 --> 01:47:26.06
You got to be strong enough to face the malevolent force of evil.

1496
01:47:26.06 --> 01:47:36.14
And you have to recognize that that force is everywhere.

1497
01:47:36.14 --> 01:47:50.38
That that's Satanic force that is waiting to pray on the weak.

1498
01:47:50.38 --> 01:47:58.10
And if we don't fight it, then that force is going to win.

1499
01:47:58.10 --> 01:48:05.82
So we cannot stand down.

1500
01:48:05.82 --> 01:48:15.70
And I think that's all I've got for tonight kind of a rough one.

1501
01:48:15.70 --> 01:48:25.70
Yes, when you think about it, this is pretty psychotic.

1502
01:48:25.70 --> 01:48:26.70
Like pretty psychotic.

1503
01:48:26.70 --> 01:48:30.14
Say, in evil for sure.

1504
01:48:30.14 --> 01:48:41.58
But I don't know if it was just the way he presented it was like, it wasn't like, it's tragic.

1505
01:48:41.58 --> 01:48:46.54
Because I don't know the other stuff that I've heard.

1506
01:48:46.54 --> 01:48:48.66
Let me tell you a part of it.

1507
01:48:48.66 --> 01:48:54.02
He wrote it and he became humanized in your head.

1508
01:48:54.02 --> 01:49:00.50
So you were listening to him talk and you were sympathizing with him and you were understanding

1509
01:49:00.50 --> 01:49:07.14
the harshness that he went through and you were completely detached and you didn't humanize

1510
01:49:07.14 --> 01:49:08.54
any of the victims at all.

1511
01:49:08.54 --> 01:49:09.54
Right.

1512
01:49:09.54 --> 01:49:10.54
Yes.

1513
01:49:10.54 --> 01:49:16.78
And I'm talking about this beautiful girl, Lisa, and what she went, you understood her.

1514
01:49:16.78 --> 01:49:18.98
Go watch some of the videos of that girl.

1515
01:49:18.98 --> 01:49:22.78
It's such a nice person.

1516
01:49:22.78 --> 01:49:25.10
Just an angel.

1517
01:49:25.10 --> 01:49:27.06
And that's what you relate to.

1518
01:49:27.06 --> 01:49:31.58
So as a person yourself, as a human being yourself, it's very easy for you to get for

1519
01:49:31.58 --> 01:49:32.58
you to humanize someone.

1520
01:49:32.58 --> 01:49:33.58
Right.

1521
01:49:33.58 --> 01:49:36.58
To you to listen to Karl Parnasar and he's been through and he's telling it from your perspective

1522
01:49:36.58 --> 01:49:37.58
and all these time.

1523
01:49:37.58 --> 01:49:42.58
You're not loving your own boy.

1524
01:49:42.58 --> 01:49:44.58
You don't know anything about that boy.

1525
01:49:44.58 --> 01:49:45.58
Right.

1526
01:49:45.58 --> 01:49:46.58
Just some arbitrary arbitrary.

1527
01:49:46.58 --> 01:49:47.58
Doesn't even barely exist.

1528
01:49:47.58 --> 01:49:48.58
It's a word.

1529
01:49:48.58 --> 01:49:50.58
Boy, that's all it is.

1530
01:49:50.58 --> 01:49:51.58
But it's not.

1531
01:49:51.58 --> 01:49:52.58
It's not.

1532
01:49:52.58 --> 01:49:53.58
That's a little kid.

1533
01:49:53.58 --> 01:49:54.58
That's exactly what it was.

1534
01:49:54.58 --> 01:49:56.58
You're going through his struggles.

1535
01:49:56.58 --> 01:49:58.58
And sure, he's not put well.

1536
01:49:58.58 --> 01:49:59.58
Yeah.

1537
01:49:59.58 --> 01:50:02.58
He's talking about his anger and everyone did say it and you're like dang.

1538
01:50:02.58 --> 01:50:03.58
Okay.

1539
01:50:03.58 --> 01:50:04.58
Dang.

1540
01:50:04.58 --> 01:50:05.58
That's, you know, he's a mad guy.

1541
01:50:05.58 --> 01:50:09.58
You know, I'm not siding with him, but it's more like you're just getting it from his

1542
01:50:09.58 --> 01:50:10.58
perspective.

1543
01:50:10.58 --> 01:50:13.58
You know, he dies and you're like, well, he's deserved it.

1544
01:50:13.58 --> 01:50:14.58
Yeah.

1545
01:50:14.58 --> 01:50:18.58
But if, yeah, if they told that the whole story of like, I don't know, any one of the

1546
01:50:18.58 --> 01:50:21.58
things that he was expecting, he'd be like, dang man.

1547
01:50:21.58 --> 01:50:22.58
This is heavy.

1548
01:50:22.58 --> 01:50:23.58
Dark.

1549
01:50:23.58 --> 01:50:27.58
And he sort of like, he didn't go in to any kind of graphic detail.

1550
01:50:27.58 --> 01:50:31.58
You just be like, and I committed sort of, in fact, I was like, bro, how are you even

1551
01:50:31.58 --> 01:50:32.58
doing that?

1552
01:50:32.58 --> 01:50:34.58
You're just, I just sort of committed tried to commit.

1553
01:50:34.58 --> 01:50:35.58
Like, how do you do that?

1554
01:50:35.58 --> 01:50:36.58
You know, you just, hey, come here.

1555
01:50:36.58 --> 01:50:37.58
Let me commit.

1556
01:50:37.58 --> 01:50:38.58
Saw to me on you.

1557
01:50:38.58 --> 01:50:39.58
I mean, I don't know.

1558
01:50:39.58 --> 01:50:40.58
Well, that's what it's like.

1559
01:50:40.58 --> 01:50:41.58
That's what it's like.

1560
01:50:41.58 --> 01:50:43.58
Two hundred pound dude against 11 year old boy.

1561
01:50:43.58 --> 01:50:44.58
Yeah.

1562
01:50:44.58 --> 01:50:47.58
But even like the, you know, his, in mates or whatever.

1563
01:50:47.58 --> 01:50:52.58
Everyone who's just, and the point is there, he just sort of just, he's praying on the

1564
01:50:52.58 --> 01:50:53.58
week.

1565
01:50:53.58 --> 01:50:54.58
He says all the time.

1566
01:50:54.58 --> 01:50:56.58
He's just picking a guy that's 132 pounds.

1567
01:50:56.58 --> 01:50:57.58
Yeah.

1568
01:50:57.58 --> 01:50:58.58
But yeah.

1569
01:50:58.58 --> 01:51:00.58
And he's 200 pounds.

1570
01:51:00.58 --> 01:51:01.58
Yeah.

1571
01:51:01.58 --> 01:51:02.58
600.

1572
01:51:02.58 --> 01:51:03.58
Yeah.

1573
01:51:03.58 --> 01:51:06.58
The, what the deal is.

1574
01:51:06.58 --> 01:51:11.58
But like, where I grew up in New England, the houses, like the ceilings are lower.

1575
01:51:11.58 --> 01:51:15.58
And the doors are smaller because people were smaller back in the day.

1576
01:51:15.58 --> 01:51:18.58
And this is a hundred years ago.

1577
01:51:18.58 --> 01:51:21.58
But or whatever, 90 years ago.

1578
01:51:21.58 --> 01:51:22.58
Yeah.

1579
01:51:22.58 --> 01:51:25.58
But a people a little bit smaller, you know.

1580
01:51:25.58 --> 01:51:30.58
So he had met six foot 190 is kind of like a yolk to do.

1581
01:51:30.58 --> 01:51:31.58
Yeah.

1582
01:51:31.58 --> 01:51:34.58
And he's just, you know, with all that, you know, years of heart labor.

1583
01:51:34.58 --> 01:51:35.58
Swing in an 18 pound hammer.

1584
01:51:35.58 --> 01:51:36.58
Yeah.

1585
01:51:36.58 --> 01:51:37.58
You know, he was strong.

1586
01:51:37.58 --> 01:51:38.58
Yeah.

1587
01:51:38.58 --> 01:51:40.58
But he just sort of breezes over it, though.

1588
01:51:40.58 --> 01:51:41.58
You know, there's no graphic details.

1589
01:51:41.58 --> 01:51:42.58
Just sort of, yeah.

1590
01:51:42.58 --> 01:51:44.58
I just committed some bad crimes.

1591
01:51:44.58 --> 01:51:45.58
You know.

1592
01:51:45.58 --> 01:51:50.58
So that's why it's always good to think about the perspective of the other people.

1593
01:51:50.58 --> 01:51:51.58
Yeah.

1594
01:51:51.58 --> 01:51:54.58
It's crazy.

1595
01:51:54.58 --> 01:51:56.58
It's crazy.

1596
01:51:56.58 --> 01:51:59.58
But, you know.

1597
01:51:59.58 --> 01:52:04.58
And yeah, he could as he should have, he should have chosen path as what he should have done.

1598
01:52:04.58 --> 01:52:05.58
Yeah.

1599
01:52:05.58 --> 01:52:06.58
Like I said, yeah, he said that right.

1600
01:52:06.58 --> 01:52:07.58
Well, more important.

1601
01:52:07.58 --> 01:52:10.58
I think, because you're going to have some people out there that are going to choose a wrong path.

1602
01:52:10.58 --> 01:52:11.58
Yes.

1603
01:52:11.58 --> 01:52:15.58
They're not, they're not going to go, they're not going to go in a good direction.

1604
01:52:15.58 --> 01:52:23.58
And that's why it's important to be prepared mentally and physically to stand up and face that, man.

1605
01:52:23.58 --> 01:52:24.58
It's true.

1606
01:52:24.58 --> 01:52:25.58
You got to.

1607
01:52:25.58 --> 01:52:28.58
Speaking of which, yes.

1608
01:52:28.58 --> 01:52:30.58
Take some, you get to.

1609
01:52:30.58 --> 01:52:36.58
So you're right now, you take some, you get to, you really decrease the probability of anyone attempting to sort of meet on you.

1610
01:52:36.58 --> 01:52:37.58
Yes.

1611
01:52:37.58 --> 01:52:38.58
That is a big help.

1612
01:52:38.58 --> 01:52:39.58
Reduce.

1613
01:52:39.58 --> 01:52:40.58
Yes.

1614
01:52:40.58 --> 01:52:41.58
You know.

1615
01:52:41.58 --> 01:52:42.58
Anyway.

1616
01:52:42.58 --> 01:52:49.58
What that means is we're going to, you get to regard this of our, our, what we're trying to defend ourselves from.

1617
01:52:49.58 --> 01:52:50.58
Uh,

1618
01:52:50.58 --> 01:52:52.58
You get to versus evil.

1619
01:52:52.58 --> 01:52:53.58
Yes, I'm saying.

1620
01:52:53.58 --> 01:52:54.58
Yes.

1621
01:52:54.58 --> 01:52:55.58
It helps.

1622
01:52:55.58 --> 01:52:57.58
If you, yes, you need all your tools to fight against evil.

1623
01:52:57.58 --> 01:52:58.58
Yeah, big town.

1624
01:52:58.58 --> 01:52:59.58
There's evil in the world confirmed.

1625
01:52:59.58 --> 01:53:00.58
Yeah.

1626
01:53:00.58 --> 01:53:01.58
Yeah.

1627
01:53:01.58 --> 01:53:03.58
Fully live evil in the world right now.

1628
01:53:03.58 --> 01:53:04.58
It's crazy.

1629
01:53:04.58 --> 01:53:05.58
It's crazy.

1630
01:53:05.58 --> 01:53:06.58
Everyone's all all flash.

1631
01:53:06.58 --> 01:53:08.58
It'll flash in my mind.

1632
01:53:08.58 --> 01:53:11.58
How valuable, you get to is.

1633
01:53:11.58 --> 01:53:18.58
Like if you, if someone said, hey, you can, you can never go to the beach ever again.

1634
01:53:18.58 --> 01:53:21.58
Or you can never do you get to ever again.

1635
01:53:21.58 --> 01:53:24.58
I assume saying, oh, you, you might have some issue.

1636
01:53:24.58 --> 01:53:26.58
No, I just think that's what it, how like the two big things.

1637
01:53:26.58 --> 01:53:31.58
You can put on the thing, so I would be, you just say, you got to give up one.

1638
01:53:31.58 --> 01:53:32.58
Yeah.

1639
01:53:32.58 --> 01:53:34.58
The beach isn't even on my list.

1640
01:53:34.58 --> 01:53:39.58
I mean, I'll just go surfing, but just going to the beach for you is a thing for me.

1641
01:53:39.58 --> 01:53:40.58
It's not really a thing.

1642
01:53:40.58 --> 01:53:41.58
Uh, yeah.

1643
01:53:41.58 --> 01:53:43.58
Well, put it this way.

1644
01:53:43.58 --> 01:53:46.58
Like I, I could, I'd trade a lot.

1645
01:53:46.58 --> 01:53:49.58
I'd give up a lot to keep you, you do, if it was in the,

1646
01:53:49.58 --> 01:53:50.58
Yeah, here's something.

1647
01:53:50.58 --> 01:53:51.58
Yeah.

1648
01:53:51.58 --> 01:53:52.58
Here's something.

1649
01:53:52.58 --> 01:53:54.58
If you know some, you do, too.

1650
01:53:54.58 --> 01:53:58.58
If you know some, you do, if you know more of you do the most other people around you,

1651
01:53:58.58 --> 01:54:00.58
that's a real beneficial thing.

1652
01:54:00.58 --> 01:54:01.58
Yeah.

1653
01:54:01.58 --> 01:54:02.58
Big time.

1654
01:54:02.58 --> 01:54:07.58
Can you, and it's funny because if you don't know anything, you're a little bit ignorant,

1655
01:54:07.58 --> 01:54:10.58
in fact, you're a lot ignorant, and you don't even know what you don't know.

1656
01:54:10.58 --> 01:54:14.58
And so you're sitting in, you're, you're walking across a parking lot, right?

1657
01:54:14.58 --> 01:54:17.58
And it's Santa Clock at night when someone comes to bother you.

1658
01:54:17.58 --> 01:54:21.58
And you think in your mind, like, I'll just do this and this and you don't know anything.

1659
01:54:21.58 --> 01:54:22.58
Yeah.

1660
01:54:22.58 --> 01:54:26.58
So it's a complete, it's a complete hole in your game.

1661
01:54:26.58 --> 01:54:28.58
And the game of life is what I'm talking about.

1662
01:54:28.58 --> 01:54:29.58
The game of life, yeah.

1663
01:54:29.58 --> 01:54:32.58
If it is, if you know GJ2 and you're walking across Santa Clock at night,

1664
01:54:32.58 --> 01:54:35.58
and someone's going to give you a problem, you actually know what to do.

1665
01:54:35.58 --> 01:54:36.58
Yeah.

1666
01:54:36.58 --> 01:54:43.58
And, and the person that doesn't know anything, there's so far, just behind.

1667
01:54:43.58 --> 01:54:45.58
It's crazy.

1668
01:54:45.58 --> 01:54:50.58
I remember in college, where, and I knew how to do a rear-de-de-kid joke.

1669
01:54:50.58 --> 01:54:54.58
And I, like, you know, just from watching, you'll see one, two,

1670
01:54:54.58 --> 01:54:59.58
never trained at actual GJ2 class, but I remember in college, I got into this like fight.

1671
01:54:59.58 --> 01:55:00.58
Right?

1672
01:55:00.58 --> 01:55:05.58
And we ended up not fighting, fighting, but you know the kind that we started to fight.

1673
01:55:05.58 --> 01:55:07.58
And, but it was nothing, you know, whatever.

1674
01:55:07.58 --> 01:55:08.58
Was it a friend?

1675
01:55:08.58 --> 01:55:09.58
No.

1676
01:55:09.58 --> 01:55:10.58
Okay.

1677
01:55:10.58 --> 01:55:11.58
He was like, was it a known person?

1678
01:55:11.58 --> 01:55:13.58
Or just a tone random?

1679
01:55:13.58 --> 01:55:14.58
Yeah.

1680
01:55:14.58 --> 01:55:15.58
He was like, at a party scenario?

1681
01:55:15.58 --> 01:55:16.58
No.

1682
01:55:16.58 --> 01:55:17.58
No.

1683
01:55:17.58 --> 01:55:19.58
And, you know, whatever.

1684
01:55:19.58 --> 01:55:21.58
It doesn't matter what, how you got broken up, whatever.

1685
01:55:21.58 --> 01:55:23.58
And we continued, you know, our lives.

1686
01:55:23.58 --> 01:55:28.58
But right now, I'm thinking back to like, how much I didn't know.

1687
01:55:28.58 --> 01:55:32.58
Like, what was I even thinking like, what was I going to do?

1688
01:55:32.58 --> 01:55:33.58
Yeah.

1689
01:55:33.58 --> 01:55:35.58
Just sort of throw punches, you know, or something like this.

1690
01:55:35.58 --> 01:55:36.58
Like, what?

1691
01:55:36.58 --> 01:55:39.58
Like, even when you do get an offite, and you don't really know any,

1692
01:55:39.58 --> 01:55:43.58
especially, you need you to, it's like, man, you sort of, it's sort of a crap shoot.

1693
01:55:43.58 --> 01:55:44.58
Really?

1694
01:55:44.58 --> 01:55:47.58
Um, compared to if you know you do do do do.

1695
01:55:47.58 --> 01:55:48.58
It's not a crap shoot.

1696
01:55:48.58 --> 01:55:52.58
It's like, oh, I'm going to either decide to do whatever I want, kind of thing to this person.

1697
01:55:52.58 --> 01:55:57.58
If you want to, if you don't train you to do and you want to know what it's like,

1698
01:55:57.58 --> 01:56:02.58
picture anything that you actually know how to do, like,

1699
01:56:02.58 --> 01:56:07.58
shoot a basketball or play basketball.

1700
01:56:07.58 --> 01:56:08.58
Yeah.

1701
01:56:08.58 --> 01:56:10.58
And picture someone that never played before playing against you.

1702
01:56:10.58 --> 01:56:11.58
Yeah.

1703
01:56:11.58 --> 01:56:12.58
That's what's going to happen.

1704
01:56:12.58 --> 01:56:13.58
Yeah.

1705
01:56:13.58 --> 01:56:14.58
If you don't know anything.

1706
01:56:14.58 --> 01:56:17.58
Or like, say, go find someone if you ever can.

1707
01:56:17.58 --> 01:56:20.58
Find someone who doesn't know how to ride a bike or skateboard.

1708
01:56:20.58 --> 01:56:25.58
Yes, not a no-sad or a skateboard, but a bike and say, hey, let's race to the end of the block on this bike.

1709
01:56:25.58 --> 01:56:27.58
And that person doesn't even know how to ride a bike.

1710
01:56:27.58 --> 01:56:28.58
They've never been on a bike before.

1711
01:56:28.58 --> 01:56:29.58
Yeah.

1712
01:56:29.58 --> 01:56:30.58
They have zero chance of it.

1713
01:56:30.58 --> 01:56:31.58
They just say, I know, that's like that.

1714
01:56:31.58 --> 01:56:32.58
Anyway.

1715
01:56:32.58 --> 01:56:33.58
Sure.

1716
01:56:33.58 --> 01:56:34.58
So train some G.Jitsu.

1717
01:56:34.58 --> 01:56:35.58
Train some G.Jitsu.

1718
01:56:35.58 --> 01:56:36.58
Go take some class.

1719
01:56:36.58 --> 01:56:38.58
Brad, just go ahead and go learn how to ride that bike.

1720
01:56:38.58 --> 01:56:39.58
Right now.

1721
01:56:39.58 --> 01:56:39.58
Right now.

1722
01:56:39.58 --> 01:56:40.58
Right now.

1723
01:56:40.58 --> 01:56:43.58
In America, you can train G.Jitsu in so many different places.

1724
01:56:43.58 --> 01:56:44.58
It's amazing.

1725
01:56:44.58 --> 01:56:45.58
Yeah.

1726
01:56:45.58 --> 01:56:47.58
There's amazing places to train G.Jitsu.

1727
01:56:47.58 --> 01:56:48.58
So go train some G.Jitsu.

1728
01:56:48.58 --> 01:56:49.58
Yeah.

1729
01:56:49.58 --> 01:56:52.58
And when you do so, you want to do G.

1730
01:56:52.58 --> 01:56:53.58
And no G.

1731
01:56:53.58 --> 01:56:55.58
So when you get a G, what G do we get?

1732
01:56:55.58 --> 01:56:56.58
We all know.

1733
01:56:56.58 --> 01:56:57.58
If you don't know already.

1734
01:56:57.58 --> 01:56:58.58
Or G.Jitsu.

1735
01:56:58.58 --> 01:56:59.58
Mm-hmm.

1736
01:56:59.58 --> 01:57:00.58
Go to OrjinMe.com.

1737
01:57:00.58 --> 01:57:02.58
They got rest cards on there as well.

1738
01:57:02.58 --> 01:57:04.58
joggers as well.

1739
01:57:04.58 --> 01:57:05.58
Shirts.

1740
01:57:05.58 --> 01:57:06.58
Supplements.

1741
01:57:06.58 --> 01:57:07.58
Supplements.

1742
01:57:07.58 --> 01:57:08.58
Supplements of course.

1743
01:57:08.58 --> 01:57:08.58
Mm-hmm.

1744
01:57:08.58 --> 01:57:10.58
And that's a good one too.

1745
01:57:10.58 --> 01:57:11.58
Where, and I took care of, I, you know,

1746
01:57:11.58 --> 01:57:13.58
Okay, remember I told you, like, oh, yeah.

1747
01:57:13.58 --> 01:57:16.58
I didn't take joint warfare for like days.

1748
01:57:16.58 --> 01:57:17.58
And you're like, what?

1749
01:57:17.58 --> 01:57:18.58
Why not?

1750
01:57:18.58 --> 01:57:20.58
I was like, oh, because I just got an offer God or whatever.

1751
01:57:20.58 --> 01:57:23.58
Here's the thing, I admitted something to myself.

1752
01:57:23.58 --> 01:57:27.58
Sometimes when I didn't back then, when I didn't take it,

1753
01:57:27.58 --> 01:57:29.58
it's not that I forgot.

1754
01:57:29.58 --> 01:57:32.58
It's just that I don't feel like, oh, I'll take one tomorrow or something.

1755
01:57:32.58 --> 01:57:33.58
Mm-hmm.

1756
01:57:33.58 --> 01:57:38.58
Like, I'm literally, I was literally too lazy to just go on the pantry right here.

1757
01:57:38.58 --> 01:57:39.58
No, by the way.

1758
01:57:39.58 --> 01:57:40.58
Like three, four feet away.

1759
01:57:40.58 --> 01:57:41.58
Yeah.

1760
01:57:41.58 --> 01:57:42.58
Get it open it up.

1761
01:57:42.58 --> 01:57:43.58
I'm getting your routine now.

1762
01:57:43.58 --> 01:57:46.58
But, yes, and this is how I put it into my routine.

1763
01:57:46.58 --> 01:57:51.58
I was like, there's no way I'm going to be able to accept the fact that I'm too lazy to spend

1764
01:57:51.58 --> 01:57:54.58
literally 20 seconds, literally.

1765
01:57:54.58 --> 01:57:57.58
And you know, and take some pills.

1766
01:57:57.58 --> 01:57:58.58
Yeah.

1767
01:57:58.58 --> 01:58:00.58
There's like no way I can accept that.

1768
01:58:00.58 --> 01:58:03.58
Do you know what I'm not trapped in your brain when you feel like?

1769
01:58:03.58 --> 01:58:05.58
I'm kind of out, I guess, a little bit.

1770
01:58:05.58 --> 01:58:08.58
For least two hours a week, I'm a little bit trapped in your brain.

1771
01:58:08.58 --> 01:58:11.58
Well, you're the one who's correcting it, because I'm like,

1772
01:58:11.58 --> 01:58:13.58
I don't know what, because you're like, dude, just do it in your routine.

1773
01:58:13.58 --> 01:58:16.58
And you make it sound so easy, because it doesn't feel that easy,

1774
01:58:16.58 --> 01:58:19.58
but then I'm thinking, like, wait, it is that easy, really.

1775
01:58:19.58 --> 01:58:20.58
I'm just not allowed in it.

1776
01:58:20.58 --> 01:58:22.58
So you put it by your toothbrush or whatever.

1777
01:58:22.58 --> 01:58:24.58
Not keeping it in the pantry, bro.

1778
01:58:24.58 --> 01:58:25.58
15 seconds.

1779
01:58:25.58 --> 01:58:27.58
Oh, but you just do it.

1780
01:58:27.58 --> 01:58:28.58
Just do it.

1781
01:58:28.58 --> 01:58:28.58
Yeah.

1782
01:58:28.58 --> 01:58:29.58
Do a little extra.

1783
01:58:29.58 --> 01:58:30.58
Do not fix it.

1784
01:58:30.58 --> 01:58:30.58
Yeah.

1785
01:58:30.58 --> 01:58:31.58
So I can carry a little extra.

1786
01:58:31.58 --> 01:58:32.58
Anyway.

1787
01:58:32.58 --> 01:58:33.58
Check.

1788
01:58:33.58 --> 01:58:34.58
Join warfare.

1789
01:58:34.58 --> 01:58:35.58
Crill oil.

1790
01:58:35.58 --> 01:58:37.58
These are the ones that I've been talking about.

1791
01:58:37.58 --> 01:58:39.58
That are in my routine every single day.

1792
01:58:39.58 --> 01:58:40.58
Mm-hmm.

1793
01:58:40.58 --> 01:58:41.58
Join.

1794
01:58:41.58 --> 01:58:42.58
All students.

1795
01:58:42.58 --> 01:58:43.58
Oh, discipline.

1796
01:58:43.58 --> 01:58:46.58
Which, if you don't know, we have a new flavor of discipline.

1797
01:58:46.58 --> 01:58:48.58
Oh, it's called Tropic Thunder.

1798
01:58:48.58 --> 01:58:49.58
Yep.

1799
01:58:49.58 --> 01:58:51.58
I got mine.

1800
01:58:51.58 --> 01:58:53.58
And let's be real.

1801
01:58:53.58 --> 01:58:55.58
And let's be honest.

1802
01:58:55.58 --> 01:58:57.58
What it is.

1803
01:58:57.58 --> 01:58:58.58
Penacle.

1804
01:58:58.58 --> 01:58:59.58
It's been a call.

1805
01:58:59.58 --> 01:59:00.58
It's been a call.

1806
01:59:00.58 --> 01:59:04.58
But I couldn't have something out there called B.D.

1807
01:59:04.58 --> 01:59:05.58
A lot of that.

1808
01:59:05.58 --> 01:59:06.58
Come on, man.

1809
01:59:06.58 --> 01:59:07.58
Wait, Tropic Thunder isn't that a movie?

1810
01:59:07.58 --> 01:59:08.58
Yeah.

1811
01:59:08.58 --> 01:59:09.58
That's a good movie.

1812
01:59:09.58 --> 01:59:10.58
It's Lake Babin's favorite movie of all time.

1813
01:59:10.58 --> 01:59:11.58
No, actually.

1814
01:59:11.58 --> 01:59:12.58
But it's right up there.

1815
01:59:12.58 --> 01:59:13.58
Yeah.

1816
01:59:13.58 --> 01:59:14.58
Life quotes that movie a lot.

1817
01:59:14.58 --> 01:59:15.58
No.

1818
01:59:15.58 --> 01:59:16.58
I'm going to tell you.

1819
01:59:16.58 --> 01:59:17.58
I'm going to tell you right now.

1820
01:59:17.58 --> 01:59:18.58
You haven't seen Tropic Thunder?

1821
01:59:18.58 --> 01:59:19.58
Definitely.

1822
01:59:19.58 --> 01:59:20.58
I know what movie that is.

1823
01:59:20.58 --> 01:59:21.58
I think.

1824
01:59:21.58 --> 01:59:22.58
Robert Downey, Jr.

1825
01:59:22.58 --> 01:59:23.58
Yeah, but I know.

1826
01:59:23.58 --> 01:59:26.58
Most important character in there is Tom Cruise's character.

1827
01:59:26.58 --> 01:59:29.58
He's really, really funny.

1828
01:59:29.58 --> 01:59:30.58
Less.

1829
01:59:30.58 --> 01:59:32.58
Good men, I think, is the name.

1830
01:59:32.58 --> 01:59:33.58
Anyways.

1831
01:59:33.58 --> 01:59:36.58
So we couldn't call it in clear conscience.

1832
01:59:36.58 --> 01:59:37.58
We couldn't call it Piniacolata.

1833
01:59:37.58 --> 01:59:39.58
That's just wrong, right?

1834
01:59:39.58 --> 01:59:40.58
No.

1835
01:59:40.58 --> 01:59:41.58
Not happening.

1836
01:59:41.58 --> 01:59:42.58
It's an alcoholic beverage.

1837
01:59:42.58 --> 01:59:43.58
We're not doing it.

1838
01:59:43.58 --> 01:59:45.58
It's kind of a kind of a food food.

1839
01:59:45.58 --> 01:59:46.58
Was that a good word?

1840
01:59:46.58 --> 01:59:48.58
A kind of a food food.

1841
01:59:48.58 --> 01:59:49.58
Yeah.

1842
01:59:49.58 --> 01:59:54.58
Like you've never been doing an Italian restaurant or like where they where it's real.

1843
01:59:54.58 --> 01:59:55.58
It's real nice.

1844
01:59:55.58 --> 01:59:57.58
It's too nice.

1845
01:59:57.58 --> 01:59:59.58
Like they don't have like.

1846
01:59:59.58 --> 02:00:02.58
Hey, can I just get some chicken parmesan over here?

1847
02:00:02.58 --> 02:00:03.58
Yeah.

1848
02:00:03.58 --> 02:00:05.58
And when they bring you some food, it's really small.

1849
02:00:05.58 --> 02:00:06.58
Yeah.

1850
02:00:06.58 --> 02:00:08.58
And it has like a long like name.

1851
02:00:08.58 --> 02:00:09.58
Yeah.

1852
02:00:09.58 --> 02:00:10.58
In a different language.

1853
02:00:10.58 --> 02:00:11.58
Yeah.

1854
02:00:11.58 --> 02:00:14.58
But you know, the kind they put extras on the name, you know.

1855
02:00:14.58 --> 02:00:19.58
You know, fresh clot from the Appalachian blah, blah, blah in the title.

1856
02:00:19.58 --> 02:00:20.58
You know, it's like that kind.

1857
02:00:20.58 --> 02:00:21.58
Yeah.

1858
02:00:21.58 --> 02:00:22.58
But there's never very much food.

1859
02:00:22.58 --> 02:00:24.58
The longer the title, the less food you're going to get.

1860
02:00:24.58 --> 02:00:25.58
Yeah.

1861
02:00:25.58 --> 02:00:26.58
That's a good role.

1862
02:00:26.58 --> 02:00:29.58
So couldn't go Piniacolata to food food.

1863
02:00:29.58 --> 02:00:33.58
We went shopping thunder for Laefab and get his shopping thunder on.

1864
02:00:33.58 --> 02:00:35.58
And then don't forget about milk.

1865
02:00:35.58 --> 02:00:40.58
Which is additional protein additional protein and slash dessert.

1866
02:00:40.58 --> 02:00:41.58
Yeah.

1867
02:00:41.58 --> 02:00:45.58
Because it will fulfill your dessert desire.

1868
02:00:45.58 --> 02:00:46.58
Yeah.

1869
02:00:46.58 --> 02:00:47.58
You get done with the rib eye steak.

1870
02:00:47.58 --> 02:00:51.58
So what's the game like when you, you know, when you're going to, when you lift weights to a

1871
02:00:51.58 --> 02:00:53.58
Lissit gains, right?

1872
02:00:53.58 --> 02:00:55.58
You have to have a certain taste with the Z.

1873
02:00:55.58 --> 02:00:56.58
Yeah.

1874
02:00:56.58 --> 02:01:00.58
You got to eat what certain amount of protein.

1875
02:01:00.58 --> 02:01:01.58
Yeah.

1876
02:01:01.58 --> 02:01:04.58
It's like 0.7 or 0.6.

1877
02:01:04.58 --> 02:01:05.58
Or just 1 gram.

1878
02:01:05.58 --> 02:01:06.58
Yeah.

1879
02:01:06.58 --> 02:01:09.58
But here's actually what I learned with one graph.

1880
02:01:09.58 --> 02:01:15.58
Any protein like any macro they eat too much of, get turned to fat.

1881
02:01:15.58 --> 02:01:19.58
And protein, so you can get turns to sugar first from what I understand.

1882
02:01:19.58 --> 02:01:22.58
So you can eat too much protein.

1883
02:01:22.58 --> 02:01:24.58
His eyes are too much protein.

1884
02:01:24.58 --> 02:01:28.58
If you're going like two grams per body weight per pound of body weight.

1885
02:01:28.58 --> 02:01:30.58
What about nine grams per body?

1886
02:01:30.58 --> 02:01:32.58
I think that's fine.

1887
02:01:32.58 --> 02:01:35.58
So here's a good way to do it.

1888
02:01:35.58 --> 02:01:37.58
So in the morning, I make a omelet, right?

1889
02:01:37.58 --> 02:01:39.58
With egg whites.

1890
02:01:39.58 --> 02:01:40.58
Mm-hmm.

1891
02:01:40.58 --> 02:01:42.58
And it's good protein, clean, whatever.

1892
02:01:42.58 --> 02:01:43.58
Some of the best.

1893
02:01:43.58 --> 02:01:48.58
But when you kind of, if you're starting to, which I kind of started to measure these things

1894
02:01:48.58 --> 02:01:50.58
or keep track of, okay, how many of you can I am?

1895
02:01:50.58 --> 02:01:51.58
I really need whatever.

1896
02:01:51.58 --> 02:01:54.58
So it realizes not that much protein in a regular size.

1897
02:01:54.58 --> 02:01:58.58
Even a double size egg white omelet with no cheese and nothing.

1898
02:01:58.58 --> 02:02:02.58
So boom, you make your egg white omelet.

1899
02:02:02.58 --> 02:02:04.58
Maltrain.

1900
02:02:04.58 --> 02:02:07.58
Going on the side, make your mokshake.

1901
02:02:07.58 --> 02:02:08.58
Boom, perfect.

1902
02:02:08.58 --> 02:02:09.58
Oh mokshake.

1903
02:02:09.58 --> 02:02:11.58
Perfect, I'm on a protein.

1904
02:02:11.58 --> 02:02:15.58
I'm saying, if in fact you're into, you know, getting stronger and one, not.

1905
02:02:15.58 --> 02:02:16.58
Yep.

1906
02:02:16.58 --> 02:02:26.58
And on top of that, we got Warrior Kid Mokk, which is basically going to take over all milk

1907
02:02:26.58 --> 02:02:30.58
drinks for children in the very short period of time.

1908
02:02:30.58 --> 02:02:34.58
Because everyone wants their kid to be healthy.

1909
02:02:34.58 --> 02:02:36.58
The kid wants to be healthy and strong.

1910
02:02:36.58 --> 02:02:39.58
And the kid wants something that tastes absolutely amazing.

1911
02:02:39.58 --> 02:02:40.58
So there you go.

1912
02:02:40.58 --> 02:02:41.58
Warrior Kid Mokk.

1913
02:02:41.58 --> 02:02:42.58
Yeah.

1914
02:02:42.58 --> 02:02:45.58
Remember, like back in the day, it was the Hawaiian punch.

1915
02:02:45.58 --> 02:02:47.58
Oh, was that only in Hawaii?

1916
02:02:47.58 --> 02:02:48.58
That was in Hawaii.

1917
02:02:48.58 --> 02:02:50.58
That was just all the Hawaiian punch.

1918
02:02:50.58 --> 02:02:52.58
But it tasted like,

1919
02:02:52.58 --> 02:02:57.58
Hey, our English muffins over here.

1920
02:02:57.58 --> 02:02:58.58
I don't know.

1921
02:02:58.58 --> 02:03:00.58
Actually, English muffins aren't in England.

1922
02:03:00.58 --> 02:03:01.58
It's not a British thing.

1923
02:03:01.58 --> 02:03:03.58
Yeah, just like French fries aren't in France.

1924
02:03:03.58 --> 02:03:04.58
No.

1925
02:03:04.58 --> 02:03:06.58
They call them like palm treats.

1926
02:03:06.58 --> 02:03:07.58
Something else.

1927
02:03:07.58 --> 02:03:08.58
French.

1928
02:03:08.58 --> 02:03:10.58
Anyway, you know what I'm saying?

1929
02:03:10.58 --> 02:03:13.58
You should drink the Hawaiian punch when you're little,

1930
02:03:13.58 --> 02:03:14.58
mouth-al-read.

1931
02:03:14.58 --> 02:03:15.58
Taste it pretty good.

1932
02:03:15.58 --> 02:03:17.58
Yeah, well, it's super strong.

1933
02:03:17.58 --> 02:03:18.58
Yeah.

1934
02:03:18.58 --> 02:03:21.58
But, bro, you can't be giving your kids that like now with the knowledge.

1935
02:03:21.58 --> 02:03:22.58
No, no, no, no, no.

1936
02:03:22.58 --> 02:03:23.58
Yeah, it's like a non-assin.

1937
02:03:23.58 --> 02:03:24.58
Really?

1938
02:03:24.58 --> 02:03:25.58
It's a chillb child abuse.

1939
02:03:25.58 --> 02:03:26.58
Yeah.

1940
02:03:26.58 --> 02:03:27.58
And it's not just that.

1941
02:03:27.58 --> 02:03:29.58
These regular chocolate milk.

1942
02:03:29.58 --> 02:03:30.58
What is that?

1943
02:03:30.58 --> 02:03:32.58
It's just corn syrup in milk.

1944
02:03:32.58 --> 02:03:33.58
Yeah.

1945
02:03:33.58 --> 02:03:34.58
That's all it is.

1946
02:03:34.58 --> 02:03:35.58
And chocolate.

1947
02:03:35.58 --> 02:03:36.58
Yeah, and chocolate.

1948
02:03:36.58 --> 02:03:37.58
And sugar.

1949
02:03:37.58 --> 02:03:39.58
But we get kid-boy or kid-mulk.

1950
02:03:39.58 --> 02:03:40.58
Guess what?

1951
02:03:40.58 --> 02:03:41.58
You're making them stronger.

1952
02:03:41.58 --> 02:03:42.58
Smurger.

1953
02:03:42.58 --> 02:03:43.58
Faster.

1954
02:03:43.58 --> 02:03:44.58
Better.

1955
02:03:44.58 --> 02:03:46.58
And it tastes delicious.

1956
02:03:46.58 --> 02:03:49.58
Because kids don't want to drink something that tastes like crap.

1957
02:03:49.58 --> 02:03:50.58
No.

1958
02:03:50.58 --> 02:03:51.58
Drink something tasty.

1959
02:03:51.58 --> 02:03:52.58
So yeah, where you're kid-mulk.

1960
02:03:52.58 --> 02:03:56.58
All that stuff that we just talked about is at originmain.com.

1961
02:03:56.58 --> 02:03:57.58
If you want to support.

1962
02:03:57.58 --> 02:03:58.58
That's the good stuff.

1963
02:03:58.58 --> 02:04:00.58
All we're making made.

1964
02:04:00.58 --> 02:04:02.58
We throw that in there like it's a no big deal.

1965
02:04:02.58 --> 02:04:03.58
Yeah.

1966
02:04:03.58 --> 02:04:07.58
Go watch some of the videos of looms being remade.

1967
02:04:07.58 --> 02:04:08.58
Yeah.

1968
02:04:08.58 --> 02:04:09.58
It's good.

1969
02:04:09.58 --> 02:04:12.58
Also, if you want to represent while on the path,

1970
02:04:12.58 --> 02:04:13.58
Jocco is a store.

1971
02:04:13.58 --> 02:04:14.58
It's called JoccoStore.

1972
02:04:14.58 --> 02:04:16.58
So you've got to JoccoStore.com.

1973
02:04:16.58 --> 02:04:18.58
This is where you can get shirts and whatnot.

1974
02:04:18.58 --> 02:04:19.58
Discipline equals freedom.

1975
02:04:19.58 --> 02:04:20.58
Church.

1976
02:04:20.58 --> 02:04:21.58
Teacher.

1977
02:04:21.58 --> 02:04:22.58
Teacher.

1978
02:04:22.58 --> 02:04:23.58
Teacher.

1979
02:04:23.58 --> 02:04:24.58
Teacher.

1980
02:04:24.58 --> 02:04:25.58
Teacher.

1981
02:04:25.58 --> 02:04:26.58
Truckers.

1982
02:04:26.58 --> 02:04:27.58
Hats.

1983
02:04:27.58 --> 02:04:28.58
Or.

1984
02:04:28.58 --> 02:04:30.58
Flex Fats.

1985
02:04:30.58 --> 02:04:31.58
Whatever one you want.

1986
02:04:31.58 --> 02:04:32.58
Man.

1987
02:04:32.58 --> 02:04:33.58
I like the flip.

1988
02:04:33.58 --> 02:04:34.58
Flex.

1989
02:04:34.58 --> 02:04:35.58
I'm putting.

1990
02:04:35.58 --> 02:04:36.58
I'm going to put a bunch of new stuff on there.

1991
02:04:36.58 --> 02:04:37.58
A bunch.

1992
02:04:37.58 --> 02:04:38.58
2019.

1993
02:04:38.58 --> 02:04:39.58
It's 2019.

1994
02:04:39.58 --> 02:04:40.58
By the way.

1995
02:04:40.58 --> 02:04:41.58
Happy New Year.

1996
02:04:41.58 --> 02:04:42.58
Brother.

1997
02:04:42.58 --> 02:04:43.58
Thanks.

1998
02:04:43.58 --> 02:04:44.58
Is it funny?

1999
02:04:44.58 --> 02:04:47.58
I felt like you felt kind of uncomfortable telling me happy.

2000
02:04:47.58 --> 02:04:49.58
I like it's too like sentimental.

2001
02:04:49.58 --> 02:04:51.58
Hey, happy New Year, bro.

2002
02:04:51.58 --> 02:04:52.58
No.

2003
02:04:52.58 --> 02:04:54.58
We all work to do.

2004
02:04:54.58 --> 02:04:55.58
Let's go.

2005
02:04:55.58 --> 02:04:56.58
Focus.

2006
02:04:56.58 --> 02:04:57.58
All right.

2007
02:04:57.58 --> 02:04:58.58
New Year.

2008
02:04:58.58 --> 02:04:59.58
New Year.

2009
02:04:59.58 --> 02:05:00.58
New Year.

2010
02:05:00.58 --> 02:05:01.58
New Year.

2011
02:05:01.58 --> 02:05:02.58
New Year.

2012
02:05:02.58 --> 02:05:03.58
New Year.

2013
02:05:03.58 --> 02:05:04.58
You got it.

2014
02:05:04.58 --> 02:05:05.58
That's cool.

2015
02:05:05.58 --> 02:05:06.58
Anyway.

2016
02:05:06.58 --> 02:05:09.58
I'm going to put a bunch of new stuff there for this year.

2017
02:05:09.58 --> 02:05:11.58
Cool.

2018
02:05:11.58 --> 02:05:13.58
You can also get JoccoWiteT.

2019
02:05:13.58 --> 02:05:15.58
That comes in either.

2020
02:05:15.58 --> 02:05:21.18
But regular T form like I'm drinking with tea bags or the can form like echo is drinking

2021
02:05:21.18 --> 02:05:23.18
with the can.

2022
02:05:23.18 --> 02:05:28.18
And the good thing about it is it's the only beverage in history or world that's guaranteed

2023
02:05:28.18 --> 02:05:32.18
100% to give you an 8,000 pound deadlift.

2024
02:05:32.18 --> 02:05:33.90
That's 8,000 pounds.

2025
02:05:33.90 --> 02:05:37.90

2027
02:05:39.90 --> 02:05:40.90
So annoying.

2028
02:05:40.90 --> 02:05:41.90
Okay.

2029
02:05:41.90 --> 02:05:42.90
Just skip this part.

2030
02:05:42.90 --> 02:05:44.50
The Warrior Kid podcast.

2031
02:05:44.50 --> 02:05:45.66
The one you should check out.

2032
02:05:45.66 --> 02:05:48.82
If you don't check out the Warrior Kid podcast, whether you have kids or not, check

2033
02:05:48.82 --> 02:05:49.82
it out.

2034
02:05:49.82 --> 02:05:53.02
Glotty Kid Lessons from Uncle Jake.

2035
02:05:53.02 --> 02:05:54.02
So do that.

2036
02:05:54.02 --> 02:05:56.66
And then don't forget about your Warrior Kid soap.

2037
02:05:56.66 --> 02:05:58.46
And it's not soap for Warrior Kids.

2038
02:05:58.46 --> 02:06:00.26
It's soap made by a Warrior Kid.

2039
02:06:00.26 --> 02:06:08.58
Aiden has got his own business at IrishOxRanch.com.

2040
02:06:08.58 --> 02:06:09.86
What's that?

2041
02:06:09.86 --> 02:06:11.50
Like Earth Made.

2042
02:06:11.50 --> 02:06:12.50
Earth Made?

2043
02:06:12.50 --> 02:06:13.50
Yeah.

2044
02:06:13.50 --> 02:06:14.50
So he gets like goats.

2045
02:06:14.50 --> 02:06:18.98
Like if you want to know the source of your...

2046
02:06:18.98 --> 02:06:19.98
Oh, yes.

2047
02:06:19.98 --> 02:06:20.98
Yeah.

2048
02:06:20.98 --> 02:06:21.98
Like there you go.

2049
02:06:21.98 --> 02:06:22.98
Locally sourced.

2050
02:06:22.98 --> 02:06:23.98
Yeah.

2051
02:06:23.98 --> 02:06:24.98
It's not local technique.

2052
02:06:24.98 --> 02:06:26.74
Well, the people in the world are the ones who are.

2053
02:06:26.74 --> 02:06:29.02
But from the last, made in America.

2054
02:06:29.02 --> 02:06:30.02
That's true.

2055
02:06:30.02 --> 02:06:31.02
Okay.

2056
02:06:31.02 --> 02:06:34.22
So YouTube, you can also subscribe to the YouTube channel, which is the Jocco podcast

2057
02:06:34.22 --> 02:06:35.22
YouTube channel.

2058
02:06:35.22 --> 02:06:38.62
And since you're putting all this new stuff on the story, you're going to put some new

2059
02:06:38.62 --> 02:06:39.62
videos up.

2060
02:06:39.62 --> 02:06:42.46
At some point in the, you know, America history.

2061
02:06:42.46 --> 02:06:43.46
Yeah, sure.

2062
02:06:43.46 --> 02:06:44.46
Oh, yes, I am.

2063
02:06:44.46 --> 02:06:45.46
Thank you.

2064
02:06:45.46 --> 02:06:49.46
Okay, I know you were just telling me about one.

2065
02:06:49.46 --> 02:06:50.46
Yes.

2066
02:06:50.46 --> 02:06:53.26
You've done this before, were you telling me about a video and I never see it for four

2067
02:06:53.26 --> 02:06:54.26
months?

2068
02:06:54.26 --> 02:06:57.14
Well, because like, well, and this one could be one of those.

2069
02:06:57.14 --> 02:07:00.50
Cause it's like, I'm going to be like pushing it, you know?

2070
02:07:00.50 --> 02:07:01.90
Remember the Warpath one?

2071
02:07:01.90 --> 02:07:02.90
Yeah.

2072
02:07:02.90 --> 02:07:04.54
You know, I pushed it in the music.

2073
02:07:04.54 --> 02:07:08.14
And I was like, hey, should I make a bunch of things crumbling down?

2074
02:07:08.14 --> 02:07:09.78
Is that going to be dumb?

2075
02:07:09.78 --> 02:07:10.78
Let's do it.

2076
02:07:10.78 --> 02:07:16.26
We're going to find, but in the process of doing that, sometimes I'm like, this is

2077
02:07:16.26 --> 02:07:17.26
kind of dumb.

2078
02:07:17.26 --> 02:07:18.26
So I got to change it.

2079
02:07:18.26 --> 02:07:21.42
So I'm going to see, I want to push it just for out of fun.

2080
02:07:21.42 --> 02:07:23.50
But yeah, okay, I'm going to try how about that.

2081
02:07:23.50 --> 02:07:27.30
More videos and also we got psychological warfare, which we have failed.

2082
02:07:27.30 --> 02:07:28.86
We were going to get out that for the new year.

2083
02:07:28.86 --> 02:07:30.18
We did not accomplish that.

2084
02:07:30.18 --> 02:07:32.50
So that's not good.

2085
02:07:32.50 --> 02:07:33.90
But we will work on it.

2086
02:07:33.90 --> 02:07:38.86
And the current one is available, psychological warfare on iTunes, Google Play, MP3 platforms

2087
02:07:38.86 --> 02:07:42.30
of all kinds where you can get little messages.

2088
02:07:42.30 --> 02:07:47.70
We'll call from me, tracks about how to overcome a particular weakness that you

2089
02:07:47.70 --> 02:07:49.66
might be dealing with in the moment.

2090
02:07:49.66 --> 02:07:53.74
I thought about this with psychological warfare.

2091
02:07:53.74 --> 02:07:59.10
Sometimes like when the weakness creeps in, we don't like want to fight the weakness.

2092
02:07:59.10 --> 02:08:04.38
It's like, yeah, it's like we're like, it's almost like, okay, this is me, you might

2093
02:08:04.38 --> 02:08:06.22
not be able to relate.

2094
02:08:06.22 --> 02:08:09.42
Because you get mad when you feel like weakness.

2095
02:08:09.42 --> 02:08:19.58
Sometimes weakness will creep in and I'll look forward to not lift or like, okay, so

2096
02:08:19.58 --> 02:08:21.54
there's this burger place, right?

2097
02:08:21.54 --> 02:08:24.22
I'm not going to say which one.

2098
02:08:24.22 --> 02:08:28.82
And to go to this burger place, in a certain burger, you can get that's like off the

2099
02:08:28.82 --> 02:08:29.82
program.

2100
02:08:29.82 --> 02:08:30.82
You can't.

2101
02:08:30.82 --> 02:08:31.82
Oh, okay.

2102
02:08:31.82 --> 02:08:33.22
It's not a diet burger.

2103
02:08:33.22 --> 02:08:34.22
Yeah.

2104
02:08:34.22 --> 02:08:38.14
So what I, you know, when you're like, oh, should I just stick to the program,

2105
02:08:38.14 --> 02:08:40.70
but I'm really in the mood for this burger, right?

2106
02:08:40.70 --> 02:08:44.38
And the weakness creeps in takes hold.

2107
02:08:44.38 --> 02:08:48.78
And then you made the decision, all right, hey, I'm going to slip on the diet right

2108
02:08:48.78 --> 02:08:49.78
now.

2109
02:08:49.78 --> 02:08:50.78
I'm back on the plan.

2110
02:08:50.78 --> 02:08:53.26
I'm black, I'm back on the program tomorrow.

2111
02:08:53.26 --> 02:08:54.66
But I'm going to slip right now.

2112
02:08:54.66 --> 02:08:58.58
When you make that decision in your head, you feel good like, oh, I don't want to change

2113
02:08:58.58 --> 02:09:01.46
my mind because I'm so looking forward to the burger.

2114
02:09:01.46 --> 02:09:06.46
I'm saying, so it's like, what are those things where the reason sometimes people

2115
02:09:06.46 --> 02:09:11.62
won't listen or actually this has never happened to me, but I'm imagining the piece, if

2116
02:09:11.62 --> 02:09:15.02
someone doesn't want to listen to psychological warfare, that's why.

2117
02:09:15.02 --> 02:09:18.38
Because it's like, they just secretly, they don't want to accept it.

2118
02:09:18.38 --> 02:09:22.46
And it's like, you know, and they accept the weakness.

2119
02:09:22.46 --> 02:09:27.46
Yeah, this again reminds me that I'm glad I'm not trapped inside your head for more than two

2120
02:09:27.46 --> 02:09:28.46
hours.

2121
02:09:28.46 --> 02:09:30.46
It's a daily struggle.

2122
02:09:30.46 --> 02:09:32.70
No, no, the psychological is a good one.

2123
02:09:32.70 --> 02:09:33.70
It helps.

2124
02:09:33.70 --> 02:09:34.70
It helps.

2125
02:09:34.70 --> 02:09:38.18
You've got to accept the help you have to do is press play.

2126
02:09:38.18 --> 02:09:39.18
Yeah.

2127
02:09:39.18 --> 02:09:40.18
That's the point.

2128
02:09:40.18 --> 02:09:41.18
That's the way.

2129
02:09:41.18 --> 02:09:42.18
You have to press play.

2130
02:09:42.18 --> 02:09:46.18
There's a little psychological part that you have to accept the fact that you're going

2131
02:09:46.18 --> 02:09:48.70
to get a spot.

2132
02:09:48.70 --> 02:09:50.90
It's like in the gym, right?

2133
02:09:50.90 --> 02:09:55.10
When you need a spot in the gym, you don't put on some light weight.

2134
02:09:55.10 --> 02:09:58.90
You get, if you have regular weight on, you don't need a spot in cool, but you've got to

2135
02:09:58.90 --> 02:10:01.86
make the decision to put the heavy weight on there.

2136
02:10:01.86 --> 02:10:04.98
And then you've got to make the decision to go find someone to spot you.

2137
02:10:04.98 --> 02:10:06.14
That part is hard for people.

2138
02:10:06.14 --> 02:10:07.14
That's what I think.

2139
02:10:07.14 --> 02:10:08.14
That's what I think.

2140
02:10:08.14 --> 02:10:10.42
But once you get the spot, you've got the spot.

2141
02:10:10.42 --> 02:10:14.18
But you're in no danger of getting buried underneath that bench.

2142
02:10:14.18 --> 02:10:15.18
Seems like.

2143
02:10:15.18 --> 02:10:17.54
That's what psychological warfare is.

2144
02:10:17.54 --> 02:10:18.54
Come here.

2145
02:10:18.54 --> 02:10:19.54
Get it on.

2146
02:10:19.54 --> 02:10:20.54
What, Amazon Music.

2147
02:10:20.54 --> 02:10:26.98
And iTunes, Apple Music, wherever they sell MP3s, that's where you get them.

2148
02:10:26.98 --> 02:10:29.22
I got the core for.

2149
02:10:29.22 --> 02:10:30.22
It's good one.

2150
02:10:30.22 --> 02:10:31.22
Very good one.

2151
02:10:31.22 --> 02:10:33.42
Also, very up your workout, man.

2152
02:10:33.42 --> 02:10:35.54
Get some more workout stuff from on it.

2153
02:10:35.54 --> 02:10:36.90
Go on it.

2154
02:10:36.90 --> 02:10:37.90
Go on it.

2155
02:10:37.90 --> 02:10:38.90
Go on slash jocco.

2156
02:10:38.90 --> 02:10:39.90
That's where you get.

2157
02:10:39.90 --> 02:10:40.90
They got some good stuff on there.

2158
02:10:40.90 --> 02:10:44.90
Ropes, battle ropes, maces, clubs, kettlebells, of course.

2159
02:10:44.90 --> 02:10:45.90
The best kettlebells.

2160
02:10:45.90 --> 02:10:49.54
I mean, the best I've ever used.

2161
02:10:49.54 --> 02:10:51.30
I mean, is that many butt?

2162
02:10:51.30 --> 02:10:55.06
I don't even want to try any other ones because they're the best in my opinion.

2163
02:10:55.06 --> 02:11:01.58
And yeah, a lot of good stuff on there, a lot of good tips on there as well.

2164
02:11:01.58 --> 02:11:02.58
And information.

2165
02:11:02.58 --> 02:11:03.58
You know, on it.

2166
02:11:03.58 --> 02:11:05.14
Comfortable, stockable, good spot.

2167
02:11:05.14 --> 02:11:07.70
I also got some books.

2168
02:11:07.70 --> 02:11:09.90
Mike in the Dragons is out.

2169
02:11:09.90 --> 02:11:10.90
It's live.

2170
02:11:10.90 --> 02:11:14.90
And we should not ever run out of it again.

2171
02:11:14.90 --> 02:11:17.14
I printed a lot more.

2172
02:11:17.14 --> 02:11:22.14
So if you want Mike in the Dragons for you, for your kids, for your neighbor kids, for

2173
02:11:22.14 --> 02:11:26.38
your library, for your school, order Mike in the Dragons.

2174
02:11:26.38 --> 02:11:31.50
It is a story that will teach your kids and all children that read it.

2175
02:11:31.50 --> 02:11:34.38
That will stand up and face their fears.

2176
02:11:34.38 --> 02:11:40.58
It's so cool to see all the pictures of people post of like, oh, the kids.

2177
02:11:40.58 --> 02:11:41.58
Yeah.

2178
02:11:41.58 --> 02:11:42.58
Like, yeah, I got Mike in the Forkish.

2179
02:11:42.58 --> 02:11:43.58

02:11:46.46 --> 02:11:48.38
You know, this is now my kids favorite book.

02:11:48.38 --> 02:11:49.38
That's pretty cool.

2183
02:11:49.38 --> 02:11:50.38
So super stoked.

2184
02:11:50.38 --> 02:11:52.98
If you haven't read it, check it out, Mike in the Dragons.

2185
02:11:52.98 --> 02:11:55.02
You can get it on Amazon.

2186
02:11:55.02 --> 02:12:00.90
Also, weigh the warrior kid and weigh the warrior kid to Mark's mission.

2187
02:12:00.90 --> 02:12:09.94
And good news, I had a deadline of finishing weigh the warrior kid three by New Year's

2188
02:12:09.94 --> 02:12:10.94
Day.

2189
02:12:10.94 --> 02:12:11.94
Guess what I finished it.

2190
02:12:11.94 --> 02:12:12.94
He was this moment.

2191
02:12:12.94 --> 02:12:13.94
Yeah.

2192
02:12:13.94 --> 02:12:14.94
New Year's Day.

2193
02:12:14.94 --> 02:12:20.18
I had to go and finish it before I worked out because I was at my deadline.

2194
02:12:20.18 --> 02:12:22.18
That's what prioritized.

2195
02:12:22.18 --> 02:12:23.58
So your deadline.

2196
02:12:23.58 --> 02:12:24.58

2197
02:12:24.58 --> 02:12:25.58
Yeah.

2198
02:12:25.58 --> 02:12:27.58
My deadline to finish the book.

2199
02:12:27.58 --> 02:12:28.58
Good good, man.

2200
02:12:28.58 --> 02:12:29.58
So yeah.

2201
02:12:29.58 --> 02:12:30.58
So that'll be coming out.

2202
02:12:30.58 --> 02:12:34.70
But right now, get way the warrior kid and way the warrior kid to Mark's mission.

2203
02:12:34.70 --> 02:12:35.86
Those are both out discipline.

2204
02:12:35.86 --> 02:12:36.86
Because freedom field manual.

2205
02:12:36.86 --> 02:12:38.74
I know a lot of folks grab that for Christmas.

2206
02:12:38.74 --> 02:12:39.74
Appreciate it.

2207
02:12:39.74 --> 02:12:42.94
Appreciate most that you're spreading the word to people that you know.

2208
02:12:42.94 --> 02:12:43.94
Little gift.

2209
02:12:43.94 --> 02:12:45.62
Give someone the gift of discipline.

2210
02:12:45.62 --> 02:12:47.34
That's what I'm talking about.

2211
02:12:47.34 --> 02:12:51.42
If you want the audio version, it's not unautable.

2212
02:12:51.42 --> 02:12:55.34
It's on Amazon Music, iTunes, Google Play and other MP3 platforms.

2213
02:12:55.34 --> 02:13:02.94
Of course, we have extreme ownership, which was recently made some kind of chart for

2214
02:13:02.94 --> 02:13:06.98
the audio book, Laf Laf Babin and I read the audio book.

2215
02:13:06.98 --> 02:13:11.58
Well, me and the Texas Batman reading the audio book.

2216
02:13:11.58 --> 02:13:15.78
And we also read the audio book for the follow-up to that book, which is called the

2217
02:13:15.78 --> 02:13:21.26
dichotomy leadership, which I kicked off today with a tiny little excerpt.

2218
02:13:21.26 --> 02:13:22.94
That's the follow-up book.

2219
02:13:22.94 --> 02:13:28.02
And I think yeah, some people think it's better.

2220
02:13:28.02 --> 02:13:29.02
Interesting.

2221
02:13:29.02 --> 02:13:32.90
It makes sense that it is because now we've written more books and a little more experience,

2222
02:13:32.90 --> 02:13:33.90
learn more.

2223
02:13:33.90 --> 02:13:36.94
So find out for yourself, dichotomy leadership, that one's available.

2224
02:13:36.94 --> 02:13:37.94
You also got Ashlan front.

2225
02:13:37.94 --> 02:13:39.86
That's our leadership consultancy.

2226
02:13:39.86 --> 02:13:41.74
We solve problems through leadership.

2227
02:13:41.74 --> 02:13:42.74
That's what we do.

2228
02:13:42.74 --> 02:13:48.74
You need help with the leadership at your organization.

2229
02:13:48.74 --> 02:13:52.86
And if you have any kind of issue, whatever kind of issue you have, it's a leadership problem.

2230
02:13:52.86 --> 02:13:54.90
It's not a problem of HR.

2231
02:13:54.90 --> 02:13:55.90
It's a leadership problem.

2232
02:13:55.90 --> 02:13:56.90
It's not a problem.

2233
02:13:56.90 --> 02:13:59.26
The finance department, it's a leadership problem.

2234
02:13:59.26 --> 02:14:00.62
It's not an operational problem.

2235
02:14:00.62 --> 02:14:01.78
It's a leadership problem.

2236
02:14:01.78 --> 02:14:04.50
The problem that you have in your organization is a leadership problem.

2237
02:14:04.50 --> 02:14:09.06
If you need help with that, go to Ashtonfront.com for details.

2238
02:14:09.06 --> 02:14:10.74
Also, we got the master.

2239
02:14:10.74 --> 02:14:12.18
The master is now live.

2240
02:14:12.18 --> 02:14:13.18
We got Chicago.

2241
02:14:13.18 --> 02:14:14.18
We got Denver.

2242
02:14:14.18 --> 02:14:15.18
We got Sydney.

2243
02:14:15.18 --> 02:14:19.78
If you want to come to the master leadership conference, extreme ownership.com, all of the

2244
02:14:19.78 --> 02:14:23.62
masters have sold out and all the masters will sell out.

2245
02:14:23.62 --> 02:14:31.70
So if you want to come get there early, I think there's maybe a ticket or two left for

2246
02:14:31.70 --> 02:14:37.58
the live podcast that we are recording January 9th in New York City.

2247
02:14:37.58 --> 02:14:43.70
If you want to come to that, try and jump on and buy a ticket real quick because it's real

2248
02:14:43.70 --> 02:14:45.30
close to sold out.

2249
02:14:45.30 --> 02:14:46.30
Look forward to seeing there.

2250
02:14:46.30 --> 02:14:48.06
Also, EF online.

2251
02:14:48.06 --> 02:14:50.30
So we just launched this.

2252
02:14:50.30 --> 02:14:57.38
What this is, this is an online interactive leadership training source.

2253
02:14:57.38 --> 02:15:02.74
It's myself and the rest of the echelonfront training team puts together.

2254
02:15:02.74 --> 02:15:04.74
Wanted to be able to reach more people.

2255
02:15:04.74 --> 02:15:10.26
This kind of spawn from organizations that we work with where they have tens of thousands

2256
02:15:10.26 --> 02:15:12.74
or even in some cases, hundreds of thousands of employees.

2257
02:15:12.74 --> 02:15:17.06
And they want us to train everybody on the fundamental principles of combat leadership.

2258
02:15:17.06 --> 02:15:21.30
Obviously, with our six or seven instructors, we can't do that.

2259
02:15:21.30 --> 02:15:26.46
And so we had to figure out a way to scale the educational process.

2260
02:15:26.46 --> 02:15:28.82
So what we did is we went to virtual.

2261
02:15:28.82 --> 02:15:30.30
So we put this together.

2262
02:15:30.30 --> 02:15:34.70
Once we made it, we said, well, we're making it director to consumer as well.

2263
02:15:34.70 --> 02:15:42.42
So if you want to check that out, you can go to EF online.com, EF online.com and speak

2264
02:15:42.42 --> 02:15:43.94
of EF.

2265
02:15:43.94 --> 02:15:45.10
EF Overwatch.

2266
02:15:45.10 --> 02:15:52.54
This is where we are connecting proven leaders, proven combat leaders from the spec ops community

2267
02:15:52.54 --> 02:15:58.38
and from combat aviation with companies in the civilian sector that need these experienced

2268
02:15:58.38 --> 02:16:01.70
leaders to step up and lead their organization.

2269
02:16:01.70 --> 02:16:05.82
So EF Overwatch.com is where you can get involved with that.

2270
02:16:05.82 --> 02:16:10.34
Whether you're someone that's looking for talent, you can click on talent, seeker, whether

2271
02:16:10.34 --> 02:16:14.54
you're someone of that that's looking for a career, click on career, seeker and fill

2272
02:16:14.54 --> 02:16:15.54
those out.

2273
02:16:15.54 --> 02:16:18.90
We are standing by to help you.

2274
02:16:18.90 --> 02:16:24.06
And if you want to cruise with us, kind of hard.

2275
02:16:24.06 --> 02:16:25.26
Yes, sir.

2276
02:16:25.26 --> 02:16:31.38
We can be found and communicated with on the interwebs, on Twitter, on Instagram.

2277
02:16:31.38 --> 02:16:36.66
And on the Fashi, goh.

2278
02:16:36.66 --> 02:16:42.18
Eko is at Eko Charles and I am at Joko Willink and finally thanks to all our military

2279
02:16:42.18 --> 02:16:43.58
personnel out there.

2280
02:16:43.58 --> 02:16:48.58
Thank you for standing up and taking the flight to the enemy and to our folks at uniform

2281
02:16:48.58 --> 02:16:49.58
in uniform.

2282
02:16:49.58 --> 02:16:54.26
Here at home, including police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics,

2283
02:16:54.26 --> 02:17:01.26
NEMTs and the correctional officers and border patrol and all the first responders, thank

2284
02:17:01.26 --> 02:17:07.70
you for standing up to evil here at home.

2285
02:17:07.70 --> 02:17:22.62
And to Luisa, Jess Pearson and Marin Eulin, who were murdered in Morocco.

2286
02:17:22.62 --> 02:17:33.18
We will remember you and to the despicable savages that took your lives.

2287
02:17:33.18 --> 02:17:36.38
We will remember you too.

2288
02:17:36.38 --> 02:17:44.86
And we'll remember those like you and we will never surrender to the evil that you

2289
02:17:44.86 --> 02:17:48.18
bring into the world.

2290
02:17:48.18 --> 02:17:55.18
We will stand up, we will be strong and we will win.

2291
02:17:55.18 --> 02:18:19.70
And until next time, this is Eko and Joko out.
