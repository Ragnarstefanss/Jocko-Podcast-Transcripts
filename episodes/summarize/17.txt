and we've actually I got people now that have started jiu jitsu because the podcast and they say oh I just did my first jiu jitsu class damn that was humbling it is extremely humbling you're gonna get be you're never gonna know everything you're always gonna be learning that there's other ways to do things and somebody that just started can come up with amazing techniques and that's humbling and there's other martial arts that have better moves that you need to pay attention to like wrestling has better take downs like sombo with the leg locks and catch wrestling some of those things that are better moves and you need to apply those and guess what you still need to know how to strike because it can be hard to take people down so you know how to how to strike and you can't be cocky and you can't be over confident because the bottom line is in jiu jitsu you will get beat and you will get beat by smaller guys by weaker guys by older guys you're gonna get beat and there's somebody that's better than you and if you don't like that or if your ego doesn't like that then you gotta find a new game to play yeah I feel like like just like how you were saying like we a lot of this we already knew we already know about state discipline we already know about all this stuff or whatever but coming from you it helps and then on top of that I'm really starting to really understand and feel is that you know all like you on Twitter like you engage you know you like someone asks your questions it seems like you're engaging a lot more so than if somebody asks me question I'm going to answer their question so if you add in that's what I like about you it kind of individualizes that person like I'm the guy who does that you know that good part so it gives them that confidence so it's kind of like yeah tell me more kind of attitude and then at the end doing like something along the lines of like yeah good thanks you know thanks for the time or whatever and then be like I got your back and I'll just go with one move for a long period of time you got to be careful that I need to be better about that discipline equals freedom so with you jitsu the more disciplined you are in training the more freedom you have on the mat so the more you train the more you work the more you drill the more you can move the more you can escape the more you can create the more you can finish you and not to mention the fear that it eliminates because like you know I'll like let's say you're not that discipline you take two weeks off a lot of time when you come back from that two weeks like you have that added element of nervousness like dang am I gonna gas or am I gonna get you know tapped out in front of everybody when you know when you know maybe there's a higher expectation on me or something like that this real matter fact but fun funny like kind of person whatever like but when I say matter fact I mean like um like that one this one tournament when uh it was kind of later where I lost two genre Roberts and you got me with a go-go plata and you know when you lose in jujitsu training and that was the first time I lost in since I went advance you know because those doing a lot of no-gui I had never lost and genre Roberts gets me with a go-go plata so instead of you saying hey you know it's okay here nothing like that you send me a text you're sitting across the arena you're right there you send me a text and it like almost like if I want to say something to to indicate that I'm going to blame someone or something it's almost like a red flag like I'm not allowed to do that in my own mind it's like it's hard in fast rule and like I said they just stand out like a sore thumb everywhere though on TV you know the guy not even my conversation you know so when I approach things like that now and also I think of all the good things that have been done like great things and just good things whatever if these people didn't do it because they didn't feel like it like these things when they got done you know I I say it all the time there's nothing new here and we're not given out any ground breaking techniques and there's no miracle drug and there's no three-minute exercise that's going to change your life I'm not selling the self-help reach your potential through this magical mystery I'm telling people what they already know and we're talking about things that people know to be right in their own heads like discipline and hard work and consistency those are the things and we all know those things but to everybody that's that's kind of known these things for a while but they've recently started to get after it good on you but first of all you know I thank people who spread the words and it's really good to hear that feedback it fires me up to hear the feedback and when people say I motivate them I'm always like you motivate me you know that motivates me that you're out there getting up at 5 a.m. and turning your life around I think that's awesome and also what I what I liked about this was they pointed out that this isn't just military or police or jiu jitsu players it's for pretty much anybody in any station in life and any job any age man or woman any country and as a matter of fact I was in England and my wife from England and when I was in England I went and saw one of my wife's friends who I'm friends with the husband and you know here's this woman who's I don't know 40 something years old right you gotta know when to tap you gotta know when to give up on a single battle so that you don't lose the whole war gotta train for worst case scenarios you gotta start with that person on your back gotta start with the person with you in an arm lock and training for combat you gotta train for those worst case scenarios where you're outnumbered you got a bunker position but you could still always tell that there are something behind the scenes you know you know Darrogens said like he's seeing you and he was like there's I don't know this guy you know it's kind of got that same feeling I have way more than me but kind of as a result of everything I feel like we're all kind of doing this together you know you know how the guys done in Australia they'll post all that you know a lot of people everyone they're posting there you know 430 a.m. wake up time to do this everyone yeah and then um yeah well funny is that you never came off like once like like new you like immediately you never came off as this super intense person like it was more like you were just sarcastic I tell how it is and if you don't like you kind of think and all right go ahead and do that but see how that works out for you know see how many people follow you see many people want to listen to you many people want to be around you even you know I like the indirect approach to next question joko what is the number one philosophical lesson that you've learned from jiu jitsu I don't really watch that much TV but those do that's maybe you know two hours or so that I could be reading something that's gonna help me through the rest of my life or getting better at something that's gonna help my you know relationships or career or something like that and I use that example because that seems pretty pretty like not in consequence because it's only two shows it's not like I spent 10 hours a day watching TV but if you're not ready to accept them you just won't accept them or they'll just go in one year and out the other and a lot of time that has to do with who's saying it so if like I don't know your neighbor some goof off he's drinking a beer smoking a cigarette he's like hey guess what you know you should do this and it's that it can be this great advice being like I'm not going to listen to you I'm not even a listen to you and it's there for a reason survival mechanism and all these ways but it's all that exists for an you know an environment that's not current so if you can basically be aware of that and combat that where don't do the immediate payoff things so just take take what you're about to do evaluated is this going to help me other than the pleasure that I think well whether that in regards to food drinking TV shows like if you watch reality TV check yourself on now and ask yourself is this going to help me in the future and typically that that answer for those types of things you're going to be know and then consider in alternative that you can do and a lot of the stuff can be pleasurable that will help you in the future and it's totally up to you it's totally up to you why not make the good choice right so the not feeling like it is no excuse that idea came in and so now like it morphed into this thing like me not feeling like it who guess what I'm going to do I'm going to do it so I've always been into working out and so me not feeling like working out is I've always felt like working out so as far as not feeling like it that wasn't really a factor but in a bunch of other things in life it was a factor and so so you're saying we're not feeling like doing this and why you're seeing yeah but you gotta be ready to adapt you gotta constantly improve your position you gotta have fun while you're doing it you gotta practice being in bad situations you gotta make your training is realistic as possible right these are all things I talk about these in all aspects of combat and in business and in life you gotta be physically fit to your mind stay sharp that's true true in jiu jitsu yeah it's say when it comes to listening to you this podcast all the you know the answers you have for these questions and any questions I even have it seems like it it comes and a process it way more readily than you know memes on Facebook or wherever you know say that that's awesome pretty true that's that's really cool that's that's great to hear and I've I mean I've definitely seen a transition in everything you're doing I mean everything you're doing is spot on otherwise I'm gonna leave myself a little bit of an out I'm not gonna just dig in on things that I can't be positive about because why would I why would I do that now when I end up being wrong if I do take a stance on something it's no big deal I'm gonna use that as an opportunity to show that I'm humble and show that I can admit when I'm wrong I'm gonna take advantage of a good I'm wrong good and you know so I would say just keep your options open keep an open mind when you feel yourself or your ego is digging in just check yourself and admit that you're wrong and move on and one thing I think that happens with people is people think that digging in and having a strong 100% opinion makes them a pure stronger or it makes their idea pure stronger and and which means I don't dig in on a lot because I'm not a 100% sure of much right who can be a 100% sure of a lot of things and when I do do that it's not that hard for me to realize that I'm wrong stifle my ego admit it in change course it's not that big of a deal to me when I like I said when I do dig in on a subject or on a decision it's because I know like almost to a 100% certainty that I'm right and I think that's all I've got for the night so
