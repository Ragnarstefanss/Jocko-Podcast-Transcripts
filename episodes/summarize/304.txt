yeah gets worse by the way within a few days of his performance at moderate where he confirms the worst the worst fears of his critics and even more disastrous battle of makers foretimes makers fun time sorry to the people of South Africa to the Afrikaans I'm sorry makers fun time especially for a Dutch guy should be doing a little bit better the boars were concealed in a narrow in narrow trenches in front of his objective they waited patiently until the British came within easy range surprise was complete when they opened fire hail of lead swept through the ranks of the highland brigade within minutes the ground is carpeted with dead soldiers including the highland commander George O'ow shop who's too much for the remainder despite their training and discipline despite the honor of the regiment despite all the factors which the high command finally believed would induce uneducated soldiers to sacrifice themselves for the short coming of their generals they broke ranks turn tail and fled as they did so they were further pounded and demoralized by hitherto undetected batteries of blue or artillery fast forward a little bit myth you and was by no means the most foolhardy of the generals jah there was general feather stoneaw who at the battle of Belmont insisted on riding up and down in front of his men in full regalia thereby announcing his importance to the enemy and effectively hampering the fire of his own men it was not long before the boo is rectified his error by shooting off shooting them off of his horse there was general heart who at the battle of colenso inflicted 30 minutes parade ground drill on his brigade before marching them shoulder to shoulder in barracks square precision across the open veld against the booer position since it was broad daylight has densely packed column provided an irisistable target for every booer gun and rifle within range this battle in this battle the British were defeated with a loss of 1,139 casualties and ten guns against the booer losses of six dead in 21 wounded fast forward a little bit it is at this point it becomes necessary to introduce another concept which is relevant to the contact of the South African war it is that of the effects of psychological stress upon decision making it is perhaps their resistance to stress and their ability to carry on when things go wrong that good generals are most easily distinguished from poor ones which by the way if you can detach that's what's going to allow you to do that by this standard general bulleter physically so huge failed dismaly it resolute from the outset the three defeats sapt whatever confidence he ever had from being weak and fearful he became a veritable jelly of indecision his plans became vague and indefinite his specific orders scarcely more enlightening his lack of moral courage and the face of adversity revealed itself most clearly in his propensity for making scapegoats of his unfortunate subordinates those admittedly incompetent generals who had blundered on without direction or assistance from above while taking none of the blame himself again the direct antithesis of extreme ownership the nearest to such admission was a reference to bad luck bad luck it may have been but worse luck was to follow in the shape of that 1,400 foot monument to military andeptitude spy and cop the totally unnecessary storming of this mini mountain was to the boor war what the charge of the light brigade had been in the crummy and war the details are as followed while still numbed by the series the defeats just recounted bullards army of 29,000 infantry 2600 mounted men eight field batteries and ten naval guns was enriched if that is the word by the arrival of a fresh division commanded by church sir Charles Warren fast forward a little bit the plan was went wrong for several reasons in the first place warrants division was far too small for the main attack the second reason for disaster lay in the character of Warren who's been described as a deletory yet fidgety overcocious yet is a res allute and totally ignorant regarding the use of cavalry he was also obsessive obstinate self opinionated and excessively bad tempered isn't an interesting how you hear bad tempered a lot when this guy is describing freaking knucklehead leaders this also included an obsession with enormous baggage train and fear that it might be destroyed by a non-existent enemy by non-existent enemy guns on the small mountains spy on cop so concerned was he with his baggage that he spent 26 hours personally supervising its transfer across the river the delay was invaluable to the boor and it's the really the first the first tank battle where tanks were used and this is just so important because there's so much resistance here in 1912 a private civilian inventor e l demol of Adelaide presented the war office with the design for a tracked vehicle which to put it at its simplest would help solve the major tactical problem of the first World War which hadn't even started yet how to get soldiers across no manland, barbed wire and enemy trenches without being shot the war office looked at demol's design and laid it on its on one side and 1915 through a total lack of personal protection British soldiers on the western front were dying at the rate of thousands a day demol was moved to resubmit his invention again it was ignored and by the way he didn't come up with this idea four runners of the tank can be traced back to Caesar's invasion of Britain Leonardo da Vinci had designed an armored fighting vehicle in the 16th century and the concept was advanced by H. G. Wells in his book the land iron clads polished in 1903 remember when I was a kid I saw that you know a road of enchanting I was pretty stoked on that it might be concluded therefore that his invention was put aside not just because it was a new idea which it was not nor because it was not needed which it was but because it conflicted with a mystical belief and the virtues of horse to cavalry and in the power of a prolonged military barrage now we get into some of the politics that was going on about the tanks while Churchill and Lloyd George were enthusiastic supporters of the tanks master general of ordinance general von Donop remained implacably opposed to any such development in the services the major proponents of the tank development included ironically a small group of naval officers the fact that the admiral to felt less quote threatened by tanks than the war office did was strikingly illustrated at one of those demonstrations where in proponents of a new idea strive to convert skeptics by confrontation with evidence of their senses after an impeccable display in which prototype tanks cut through barbed wire cross-chinch trenches slithered through mud and clawed their way out of craters a naval officer was heard to remark we ought to order 3,000 now so the navy guys like hey bro that looks like a pretty freaking good thing but the war office contingent remained cool once senior general retorting who is this damn naval man saying we will want 3,000 tanks he talks like Napoleon him and his detached point of view um they get some tanks they get some of them they use him in battle and and here's what happens of course how do they use him about this is like when you learn an eugenia to move like hey echo you know here's this new move so he kind of thought that we needed to take this this high ground spy on cop seems like a good call the men were ordered up the steeply sloping mountainside into a fog hardly less dense than that which clouded the minds of their commanders when in almost zero visibility they thought they had reached the summit the assault force altered congratulating themselves on the total absence of opposition raised the union track jack and tried to entrench the word the operative word is tried for the top was much like the rest of the mountain solid rock nobody had warned them of this by the way he didn't do a recon just FYI they decided to use sandbags only to find that no one had to remember to bring them while the miscued they did the best they could with pieces of rocks and clouds of earth only to well aware that this flimsy protection provided no overhead cover whatsoever if this gave them food for thought there was more to follow for with a further improvement in visibility they made a second disquieting discovery they were not where they thought they were instead of the summit they found themselves on a small plateau some way below the mountain top 1,700 men on a piece of ground 400 by 500 yards and above them on three sides the boars the enemy opened fire within minute the ground was littered with corpses many with bullet holes in the side of the head or body owing to the lack of overhead cover the losses from shrapnel were even greater trapped in the seemingly hopeless position without any guidance or directives from their general the 200 lane caster fuselures laid down the arms and surrendered to the boars this their place was taken by reinforcement sent up from below meanwhile Warren and Bullard did nothing to help the hard press troops no doubt appalled by what was happening to his army on the heights above Warren supined at the best of times went into a state that has been described as paralytic important note a war correspondent who had witnessed the dire events on top of the mountain hurry down to the commanding general but instead of receiving this admittedly unsolicited information with gratitude Warren flew into a rage and demanded that the journalist should be arrested for insolence name of the war correspondent was Winston Churchill but before moving on to the next example it's worth placing the cramian and boar wars in the same perspective both present a picture of what appears to be unreleaved stupidity but more interesting is the psychological pattern of these events here was a rich and powerful nation anxious to assert assert its rights first in Russia then in South Africa what did it do but send out highly regimented armies which endeavored to make up encouraged discipline and visual splendor what they lacked in relevant training technology and adequate leadership as to the latter in each case a commander in chief was selected who despite his deficiencies remained in order to be popular with his troops for far longer than he deserved both men were genial courteous and kind both were inexperienced is irresolute and lacking moral courage both were rich and well-connected but both when the occasion demanded were only too ready to divest themselves of all responsibility for the errors which they had made and the ones seemed quite unable to learn from the mistakes of the other from the moment it might prove how to keep in mind certain characteristics of the incompetence just described they include so here's as we get into a list of problems number one an underestimation sometimes bordering on the arrogant of the enemy hmm check in equating war with sport yeah it knew it was like he was freaking stoked so um leadership strategy in tactics field manual the code evaluation protocols discipline equals freedom field manual way the warrior can want to three four mickey in the dragons hack worth about face extreme ownership dichotomy leadership we have the leadership company where we

Burke echoes at aquatral's i am at jocca willink and thanks to all the men and the women of the military who are leading not from a psychopathic mind but trying to take care of their people and accomplish the mission and also thanks to our police law enforcement firefighters paramedics EMT's dispatchers correctional officers board of patrol secret service and all first responders thank you for taking care of us by locking up the psychopaths of the world and to everyone else out there take care of your people take care of your people put them first and you don't take care of them by being easy well letting them cut corners or allowing a lack of training and allowing a lack of discipline you take care of them by helping them be the best they can be by helping them be prepared by listening to them by incorporating their ideas and by putting your own agenda and your own aspirations below there first go do that and until next time this is Dave and echo and jocco out okay where are you second dude what are we trying to do we certainly have not good enough troops to make certain of of taking bad debt Baghdad of our two divisions mine the sixth is complete the 12 has no guns or divisional troops and nixon takes them from me and lends him to gornion when he has to go anywhere I consider we ought to hold on to what we've got as long as we are held up as we are in the dardinels all these offensive operations in secondary theaters are dreadful errors in strategy the dardinels egypt messa patini a east africa i wonder and wonder at such expeditions being permitted in violation of all great fundamental principles of four especially the out of economy of force such as the violation is always punished in history so he's any got to prioritize next week why we do run around doing all these different things i'm afraid we are out in the cold here the messa patini and operations are a little noticed though we are fighting the same enemy as you have in the dardinels plus and appalling heat the hardship in France or nothing to that so this seems like a logical thing right towns like hey dude what are we doing like we already kind of got done or supposed to get done why are you pushing further let's hold what we got i don't have a bunch of troops i'm getting my my troops are getting pulled all over the place let's just kind of stand down but it's an interesting um there's another uh story in that writes the letter was completely in character it revealed a gift for strategic appreciation amounting to uh prescience it revealed towns in chronic tendency to criticize his superiors and his obsession with his own affairs to the exclusion of all others it revealed as a bit you will lack of general of generosity to his colleagues who whom he praised only if they were of inferior rank to himself his tendency to wine and almost embarrassing immodesty i think that's a hard reading of that letter and how quickly and this isn't like show the how smart i am it's like how easy it is to make the connection what you preface this was he kind of i think he listed three one was technology i forgot what the first one was and the third one was leadership and really the risk could just be one it's leadership but the title of this book is is the title of book is the psychology of it's the it's the it's the individual's person psychology and when we're talking about these things is how painful it is to sit from the outside and watch the whole that they dig or just how obvious and to your point of detachment how obvious it is it's not nuanced it's not like a slight little adjustment you're just sitting back you're watching this and there is you know there's zero chances it's gonna work not because we know the history but because of because of the setup that you're revealing this is the situation this is how these people make decisions this is the way they think like this is gonna fail this is gonna fail and how easy it is to attribute everything on one of those to a basic fundamental leadership behavior it's disturbing it's disturbing not the least of which is the one that repeats itself more than anything else which is what you talked about at the very beginning was humility just the inability to be humble it's it's it's it's it's hard to listen to you you know we're gonna do that or that's obvious or whatever so literally you know so nice start caring about like you know my the king of wherever and all these other you know personal interest whatever I'm gonna say something that I don't know maybe this makes me a psychopath if I would have been in charge of the British military I would have assembled a hit team and we would have gone and killed towns and like execution style and brought his body back and said hey leaders this is not how we lead into the question you asked too I think given the author's education he's using that term in the clinical sense like that is not like it's not a slang term for a dude is kind of messed up he's calling him he's he's referring to the psychopathic tendencies he means that in the the medical literal sense of that word I I saw this when when we developed and the machine was the example we used last time but when we developed stealth technology and it really became evident to the world and desert storm because nobody really most people didn't really know is going on and all of a sudden first on a desert storm we're flying to the top of Baghdad with airplanes that nobody could see and there was a level of disbelief going on there from the Iraqi defense system as there's bombs going off around them like I hear I hear airplanes those are jet engines flying over her as I can't see them right here them things are blowing up but there was an incapacity to to accept that he was happening because they didn't see it and this doesn't exist well unfortunately one of the byproducts of that was some people were paying attention to that and there's this massive shift from the early 90s to building stealth airplanes we have a bunch of them now guess who else has the rush in the Chinese are you know our primary enemies but the idea of being in a fight was something you can't see which is what's one of the things that stealth allows you to do is one of the most common things that you see when you're in the stair there plane is other people behaving as if you're not there when they know you're there they just can't see you and like well I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing like good lord but because of the machine gun fire which was causing heavy casualties the tanks were on their own with such perfect targets the German gunners opened fire one by one the tanks were hit while the crews worked desperately at the cumbersome gears to drive a zigzag course and the gunners tried to return fire but taking accurate aim in all the pitching and tossing was virtually impossible it was some minutes before the German guns had been pulled out of action but by this time 16 tanks had been destroyed with huge gaping holes in their sides most were on fire and those crew members who had not been killed outright by the blasting shells were burned to death there were no survivors through a pious fast forward through a pious and mistaken belief in the value of horse cavalry and a paralysis thought a case by years of trench warfare the brilliant breakthrough by the tanks was thrown away some ten days later the Germans counterattacked in a matter of hours they recovered much of the ground originally lost the British third army commanded by general Sir Julian being lost 6,000 men taken prisoner some thousands killed or wounded and a vast quantity of guns and other equipment the magnitude of this disaster was directly attributable to a feature of high-level military incompetence seen all too often the ignoring of intelligence reports which did not fit in with the preconceived ideas when at last news of the disaster reached Britain it was naturally assumed that the generals had failed again heg's reputation already low sank to a vanishing point the war cabinet demanded an immediate explanation heg's response was to endorse a report from general being that the third army had not been taken by surprise and that the failure to stem the German breakthrough was due to the shortcomings of those junior officers and CEOs and men who had been involved in the fighting what a freaking savage in the face of so much contrary evidence these views did not impress the critics to stifle further debate the war cabinet called in general smuts and this freaking savage smut stated and they go into what his relationships are he's he's just a just a real piece of shit smut stated higher command army or court command were not to blame everything had been done to meet such an attack he went on to say that the fault lay either with local commanders who might have lost their heads or with those lower down junior officers and CEOs and men of those two alternatives he preferred the latter explanation and so smuts in the fashion of the day blame those least able to answer back the youthful the junior and the dead again what corrections are we now making we're not making any corrections we're like and their and their true self comes out well good place to stop for today and we know we need to be looking on the lookout for people with psychopathic traits and the meantime you know maybe we try and avoid having those traits ourselves maybe we actually try and become something a little bit more positive something good maybe we try and make ourselves better echo Charles just a just little psychopsycopathy apparently from what I understand is it like it's like a thing in your mind like a normal seemingly normal person can be a psych and a clinical psychopath it has less to do with like crazy stuff that they do it's just the inability to if I'm not mistaken to empathize with people that's one of the big problems yes we should because you know what I want I want to be the king of Baghdad for you can discover easy man the thing about lessons learned lessons learned should open your mind not close your mind these guys are lying by the way secretary of state for indian army commander Bosra Joseph Chamberlain cable this statement honor rival wounded honor rival wounded Bosra please telegraph urgently particulars and progress so this guy's saying hey what's going on with the wounded you got and Nixon replies wounded satisfactory the disposed of many likely to recover medical services under circumstances of considerable difficulty worked splendidly but Nixon to admit for you just witnessed the arrival of 4,000 and the the mejade which is a ship with 600 casualties on board and two crammed 13 days and nights on her decks and on the exposed decks of her lighters men lay huddled in pools of blood urine and feces their bodies slime with excrement their wounds crawling with maggots their shattered bones splinted wood from whiskey crates and the handles of trenching tools and their thighs backs and buttocks lepros with source i mean while towns and he's got his guys safely up and cut it well all this is happening these guys are getting slaughter 23,000 casualties and towns ends up their kind of chilling over the period of the siege he evaded he evenced several characteristics it towns and communications were not however confined to those outside cut during the siege he had devoted much attention to issuing of communicates to his troops these were remarkable for three features a flagrant to soil t-tourds towards and criticism of his superiors of thinly veiled contempt for the valiant but unsuccessful relief force and a total absence of gratitude toward those who are losing their lives trying to rescue him towns and was always prepared to abandon his beloved command in the interest of either his own release or his own advancement on March 5th he had again requested promotion this guy's calling he's captured he's freaking in siege after causing himself to be there he's asking him to promote it on April 9th for the second time he had suggested that he should attempt escape to escape from caught and leave his division to its fate you imagine running that up the chain of command
