00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.76 This is Jocco podcast number 112.
00:00:05.76 --> 00:00:08.40 With echo Charles and me, Jocco willing.
00:00:08.40 --> 00:00:09.40 Good evening echo.
00:00:09.40 --> 00:00:14.000 Good evening.
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:26.12 I had a friend and some day when I can, I will tell you all about him.
00:00:26.12 --> 00:00:36.000 But until then for now, I will say that I could not have asked to pray better friend.
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.60 Did he have faults?
00:00:38.60 --> 00:00:40.96 Sure.
00:00:40.96 --> 00:00:43.84 Don't we all?
00:00:43.84 --> 00:00:49.96 Now most of his faults weren't really that big of a deal.
00:00:49.96 --> 00:00:53.72 But they were raw.
00:00:53.72 --> 00:01:03.80 Not because he admitted to them all openly and directly and naively to be honest, in a sort
00:01:03.80 --> 00:01:09.68 of pointed and heavy handed self critique, he would bear his weaknesses to the world
00:01:09.68 --> 00:01:16.04 and to me and to himself.
00:01:16.04 --> 00:01:23.04 He would speak to me as if I had no faults.
00:01:23.04 --> 00:01:29.56 I would try to explain otherwise, but he wouldn't listen.
00:01:29.56 --> 00:01:34.68 He would only judge himself.
00:01:34.68 --> 00:01:36.88 I'm too emotional.
00:01:36.88 --> 00:01:40.36 He would say, not really.
00:01:40.36 --> 00:01:41.36 I tell him.
00:01:41.36 --> 00:01:47.44 I don't know how to talk to people right now.
00:01:47.44 --> 00:01:50.28 Sure you do, let's say.
00:01:50.28 --> 00:01:55.92 I make the same mistakes over and over and over again, he would say, we all do.
00:01:55.92 --> 00:02:00.56 I would tell him.
00:02:00.56 --> 00:02:03.12 I was better than him at some things.
00:02:03.12 --> 00:02:06.56 We both knew that.
00:02:06.56 --> 00:02:16.56 There were other things he was better at than me, but he always downplayed those things.
00:02:16.56 --> 00:02:21.28 And we both knew that too.
00:02:21.28 --> 00:02:33.24 When we were overseas in a bad place, in a wretched place, he never complained.
00:02:33.24 --> 00:02:36.76 And I gave him every reason too.
00:02:36.76 --> 00:02:41.96 I put him in the worst locations with the greatest possible chances for failure and the
00:02:41.96 --> 00:02:51.48 highest probability for fire and fury and blood and death.
00:02:51.48 --> 00:02:59.60 But despite the enemy and the heat and the living conditions and the fear and the wounded
00:02:59.60 --> 00:03:11.44 men and the screams and the misery that was all around, he did not complain.
00:03:11.44 --> 00:03:20.56 It seemed at times that God himself was trying to test the limits of my friend.
00:03:20.56 --> 00:03:32.08 It seemed like sooner or later the bullets or the bombs would find him.
00:03:32.08 --> 00:03:42.88 But through some incomprehensible miracle he survived through that deployment.
00:03:42.88 --> 00:03:54.40 Now I make no claim whatsoever to understand why things in life unfold the way they do.
00:03:54.40 --> 00:04:03.40 In fact, I must say that many of the things I've seen in the world make no sense to me at all.
00:04:03.40 --> 00:04:10.96 Sometimes it's just utter confusion, no rhyme, no reason.
00:04:10.96 --> 00:04:22.96 Some of the things that I've seen have left me downright disgusted, jaded, repulsed,
00:04:22.96 --> 00:04:34.52 sickened by mankind and the awful and reprehensible things we are capable of.
00:04:34.52 --> 00:04:38.72 But there's another side to that.
00:04:38.72 --> 00:04:44.24 There's another side and there are other people who do their best to redeem all the evil
00:04:44.24 --> 00:04:50.28 our souls are capable of.
00:04:50.28 --> 00:04:55.64 My friend was one of those people.
00:04:55.64 --> 00:05:01.60 After deploying with me and surviving that bloody and violent battlefield, my friend, like
00:05:01.60 --> 00:05:08.56 most of the guys in my old job, he volunteered to deploy again.
00:05:08.56 --> 00:05:15.68 I thought and I told him prematurely and incorrectly that the enemy was done.
00:05:15.68 --> 00:05:17.80 I told him that the war was all but over.
00:05:17.80 --> 00:05:21.12 I told him just do the deployment and sit tight over there and play the game.
00:05:21.12 --> 00:05:24.96 And in a few months we'll be back and we can go surfing and we can play guitar and we can
00:05:24.96 --> 00:05:31.88 tell stories and we can cook stakes and we can surf some more.
00:05:31.88 --> 00:05:39.000 I told him we could carry on when he got home.
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.56 That was a plan.
00:05:42.56 --> 00:05:48.96 It was a good plan.
00:05:48.96 --> 00:05:57.36 But the enemy gets a vote and there was intense violence during that deployment for him
00:05:57.36 --> 00:05:59.56 as well.
00:05:59.56 --> 00:06:04.20 It was similar to what we had experienced together overseas and aggressive enemy held
00:06:04.20 --> 00:06:12.80 bent on killing Americans, mixed in an urban environment with a terrified local populace.
00:06:12.80 --> 00:06:17.08 He told me that the enemy he was now facing wasn't as tactically skilled as the enemy
00:06:17.08 --> 00:06:26.12 we had faced but he said that they were braver and more determined.
00:06:26.12 --> 00:06:30.68 That seemed to concern him a bit more.
00:06:30.68 --> 00:06:40.80 He seemed to feel the odds were that he would die.
00:06:40.80 --> 00:06:45.68 He sent me his last will and testament.
00:06:45.68 --> 00:06:51.28 He was not merouse about it just stating the facts.
00:06:51.28 --> 00:06:53.08 It's bad over here.
00:06:53.08 --> 00:06:56.04 The enemy is aggressive, casualty rates are very high.
00:06:56.04 --> 00:07:04.32 The enemy has new weapons that are extremely capable.
00:07:04.32 --> 00:07:08.36 It didn't look good.
00:07:08.36 --> 00:07:11.92 I waited.
00:07:11.92 --> 00:07:17.52 I waited the long and completely powerless weight.
00:07:17.52 --> 00:07:27.52 One known mostly by mothers and fathers and wives and children that are old enough to understand.
00:07:27.52 --> 00:07:40.84 But a weight also made by the brothers at home that know the risk all too well.
00:07:40.84 --> 00:07:49.68 It was a long weight.
00:07:49.68 --> 00:07:59.16 At my friend's memorial service, his brother told the story.
00:07:59.16 --> 00:08:05.64 My friend had talked to his brother on the phone while my friend was on deployment.
00:08:05.64 --> 00:08:11.44 My friend had explained to his brother in no uncertain terms the situation that my friend
00:08:11.44 --> 00:08:14.20 was in.
00:08:14.20 --> 00:08:15.96 The enemy was extremely hostile.
00:08:15.96 --> 00:08:17.64 The battlefield was chaotic.
00:08:17.64 --> 00:08:22.16 The attacks were frequent and furious.
00:08:22.16 --> 00:08:28.76 It was violence that my friend had not experienced before.
00:08:28.76 --> 00:08:38.84 His voice was war unleashed and it seemed to be heading to an inescapable conclusion.
00:08:38.84 --> 00:08:44.44 And my friend's brother sent this.
00:08:44.44 --> 00:08:54.44 Even through the phone even thousands of miles away as his brother, he sent the darkness
00:08:54.44 --> 00:09:03.40 and the overwhelming finality of the situation.
00:09:03.40 --> 00:09:07.72 And he said to my friend, do you need anything for me?
00:09:07.72 --> 00:09:10.08 How can I help?
00:09:10.08 --> 00:09:16.08 Is there anything that I can do?
00:09:16.08 --> 00:09:31.000 My friend was quiet for a moment and then my friend made one simple request.
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:43.20 He said, pray for my men.
00:09:43.20 --> 00:10:00.64 Now I want you to think about that level of selflessness, that level of faith and of commitment
00:10:00.64 --> 00:10:11.32 and of care for others, that dedication in the face of fear and violence and death
00:10:11.32 --> 00:10:27.04 to at that moment put others' bris before yourself to do good, to be heroic and strong and brave
00:10:27.04 --> 00:10:33.52 and yet at the same time to be humble and to be willing to sacrifice everything for your
00:10:33.52 --> 00:10:39.56 friends.
00:10:39.56 --> 00:10:56.16 That's a man and I couldn't have asked for a better friend.
00:10:56.16 --> 00:11:02.68 The world can be a horrible place.
00:11:02.68 --> 00:11:08.60 It's filled with violence and treachery and sometimes it seems that the legions of demonic
00:11:08.60 --> 00:11:14.16 powers have the upper hand and the battle between good and evil and it can seem that all
00:11:14.16 --> 00:11:20.92 might be lost.
00:11:20.92 --> 00:11:33.80 And then we remember, we see the light and for me the light comes from the example of others
00:11:33.80 --> 00:11:41.20 in this case, another person, another human being.
00:11:41.20 --> 00:11:47.88 My friend who despite all the powers of darkness stood up and rejected all that wickedness
00:11:47.88 --> 00:11:59.000 and proved that there is hope and there is a path to light and we can get on that path
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:08.68 if we choose to do so like my friend did.
00:12:08.68 --> 00:12:11.24 And that's life.
00:12:11.24 --> 00:12:16.32 At least as far as I can unravel the mystery, that's what I see.
00:12:16.32 --> 00:12:22.32 We are here and the best thing we can do is stand against the darkness and try to spread
00:12:22.32 --> 00:12:28.96 light in the world.
00:12:28.96 --> 00:12:36.20 That can be a very hard thing to do because life is not easy.
00:12:36.20 --> 00:12:47.48 In fact, it is said and there are very few that would deny that life itself is suffering.
00:12:47.48 --> 00:12:51.76 But there is a way.
00:12:51.76 --> 00:13:00.20 And there is a path.
00:13:00.20 --> 00:13:09.48 And today I have someone on the podcast for a second time that I think can help guide us
00:13:09.48 --> 00:13:17.88 down that path away from darkness and toward the light.
00:13:17.88 --> 00:13:27.68 Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, welcome back to the podcast for a second time.
00:13:27.68 --> 00:13:29.32 Thanks, Jorgal.
00:13:29.32 --> 00:13:36.60 You were on podcast number 98 last time and if anyone wants to stop right now, go and listen
00:13:36.60 --> 00:13:41.44 to 98 if you haven't listened to it yet and that's a good place to start learning about
00:13:41.44 --> 00:13:46.84 you and then you could also just google Jordan Peterson and go from there because there's
00:13:46.84 --> 00:13:53.84 thousands of hours of content of you on YouTube.
00:13:53.84 --> 00:14:00.48 Yeah, there's probably horrible as it is to contemplate.
00:14:00.48 --> 00:14:02.20 Yeah, there probably is.
00:14:02.20 --> 00:14:08.12 I mean, I've contributed about 500 hours probably of lectures and so on but people have
00:14:08.12 --> 00:14:12.76 been cutting it up and there's all the podcasts and YouTube videos that other people have
00:14:12.76 --> 00:14:17.16 made and I think I looked the other day because people keep chopping up the lectures and
00:14:17.16 --> 00:14:21.32 the interviews and making little videos and my son and I tried to estimate it last week.
00:14:21.32 --> 00:14:26.56 It looked like 4,000 people have made videos last week in one week.
00:14:26.56 --> 00:14:28.56 Yeah, it's really, yeah, it's crazy.
00:14:28.56 --> 00:14:30.56 It's really, yes.
00:14:30.56 --> 00:14:36.68 Okay, so you've got a new book out and the book is called 12 rules for life and
00:14:36.68 --> 00:14:45.32 an adult to chaos and one of the key points in the book is life is suffering, right?
00:14:45.32 --> 00:14:46.32 And clearly I think.
00:14:46.32 --> 00:14:48.32 I'm in the level of lens.
00:14:48.32 --> 00:14:51.32 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:14:51.32 --> 00:14:55.12 We need to own this on top of that.
00:14:55.12 --> 00:14:58.16 So you need to inflict it.
00:14:58.16 --> 00:15:02.96 You know, obviously my old line of work, we got to see that and we got to see it all the
00:15:02.96 --> 00:15:04.68 time.
00:15:04.68 --> 00:15:07.40 Two things, number one, where is that come from?
00:15:07.40 --> 00:15:11.36 And you don't need to spend a bunch of time on that because you've talked about that so
00:15:11.36 --> 00:15:12.36 much.
00:15:12.36 --> 00:15:17.000 But more important to me, what happens when people miss that point?
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000 Well, the suffering seems to be built in in some sense and it's a very difficult thing
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.92 to understand fully because the fundamental question is, does being justify suffering?
00:15:30.92 --> 00:15:32.56 It's something like that.
00:15:32.56 --> 00:15:35.32 And there's this old idea.
00:15:35.32 --> 00:15:38.28 I read this, it was a Jewish idea.
00:15:38.28 --> 00:15:39.88 It's kind of a riddle.
00:15:39.88 --> 00:15:42.44 And so it's a riddle about the nature of God.
00:15:42.44 --> 00:15:50.56 And so the riddle runs, what is it being who's omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent?
00:15:50.56 --> 00:15:54.52 So there's the three classical attributes of God, lack.
00:15:54.52 --> 00:15:58.44 I think, well, that's nothing, obviously.
00:15:58.44 --> 00:16:00.64 It's no limitation.
00:16:00.64 --> 00:16:06.08 And so that was the explanation for why God created everything, but more particularly
00:16:06.08 --> 00:16:07.44 why God created man.
00:16:07.44 --> 00:16:14.08 It's that there's something about limitation that adds to completeness.
00:16:14.08 --> 00:16:16.88 Maybe because it provides something to struggle against.
00:16:16.88 --> 00:16:18.40 It's something like that.
00:16:18.40 --> 00:16:21.68 In the book in 12 Rules for Life, I talk about what happens just happened to Superman
00:16:21.68 --> 00:16:22.68 in the 1980s.
00:16:22.68 --> 00:16:27.000 It's like Superman got so powerful that you could bounce hydrogen bombs off his chest.
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.28 You know, he could move planets.
00:16:28.28 --> 00:16:32.84 He's like, and then he got boring at the same time because what are you going to do to
00:16:32.84 --> 00:16:33.84 him?
00:16:33.84 --> 00:16:34.84 Nothing.
00:16:34.84 --> 00:16:38.16 He can just solve every problem instantly.
00:16:38.16 --> 00:16:40.12 Well, there's no story there.
00:16:40.12 --> 00:16:42.72 And you might say, well, who cares if there's a story?
00:16:42.72 --> 00:16:44.20 And that's a reasonable objection.
00:16:44.20 --> 00:16:46.52 Maybe there should just be no story at all.
00:16:46.52 --> 00:16:48.80 That's the Memphis DeFeelian objection to life.
00:16:48.80 --> 00:16:50.60 There should be no story at all.
00:16:50.60 --> 00:16:53.000 But maybe that's not the right answer.
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.20 Maybe it's better to have being even if it requires limitation.
00:16:58.20 --> 00:17:04.04 And if the limitation necessitates suffering, even if the limitation and the suffering necessitate
00:17:04.04 --> 00:17:06.84 evil, that's a separate issue.
00:17:06.84 --> 00:17:13.24 Perhaps there's a way of maneuvering through that a pathway that makes that all not only
00:17:13.24 --> 00:17:14.24 acceptable.
00:17:14.24 --> 00:17:15.44 Let's say at least acceptable.
00:17:15.44 --> 00:17:16.84 That would be a good start.
00:17:16.84 --> 00:17:23.52 But fully justifiable, something that you would voluntarily accept if you had the opportunity.
00:17:23.52 --> 00:17:28.60 It needs your sort of cotton on to that in some sense with his idea of the eternal return.
00:17:28.60 --> 00:17:32.52 He said, you should try to leave each moment of your life so that if you had to live that
00:17:32.52 --> 00:17:37.52 moment recurring for eternity that you would find that desirable.
00:17:37.52 --> 00:17:40.52 It's like, it's a high standard, man.
00:17:40.52 --> 00:17:46.08 But there's a very interesting point there, which is that maybe you can say that despite
00:17:46.08 --> 00:17:48.88 the suffering and malevolence, this is worth it.
00:17:48.88 --> 00:17:52.64 And I think people have experiences like that in their life.
00:17:52.64 --> 00:17:57.80 And you can have more experiences if you live your life, I would say, according, if you're
00:17:57.80 --> 00:18:02.84 on the proper path, then maybe your life can consist of almost nothing but experiences
00:18:02.84 --> 00:18:03.84 like that.
00:18:03.84 --> 00:18:09.48 Now, I say that knowing full well that people get cut off at the knees and that life can
00:18:09.48 --> 00:18:17.52 be very arbitrary and hard and that everyone is prone to the negative consequences of
00:18:17.52 --> 00:18:19.52 deceit and betrayal, all of those things.
00:18:19.52 --> 00:18:24.08 I mean, the book, the book, 12 rules for life in some sense is a very dark book, but
00:18:24.08 --> 00:18:28.92 it's not exactly because the darker the darkness, the brighter the light appears.
00:18:28.92 --> 00:18:29.92 It's something like that.
00:18:29.92 --> 00:18:33.52 And you know, you say, well, no, life's not so bad.
00:18:33.52 --> 00:18:36.56 You can be happy and I think no, life really is bad.
00:18:36.56 --> 00:18:37.56 It's really bad.
00:18:37.56 --> 00:18:40.76 And no matter how bad you think it is, it's actually worse than that.
00:18:40.76 --> 00:18:44.48 You can't really get to the bottom of how terrible things can get.
00:18:44.48 --> 00:18:47.40 People who have post-traumatic stress disorder know that.
00:18:47.40 --> 00:18:50.72 So they've hit something so bad that they cannot live with it.
00:18:50.72 --> 00:18:52.36 They have no idea how to live with it.
00:18:52.36 --> 00:18:56.04 And it hurts them, not just psychologically, but physiologically as well.
00:18:56.04 --> 00:18:57.96 It's very difficult to recover.
00:18:57.96 --> 00:19:00.32 So they have a sense of how bad it can be.
00:19:00.32 --> 00:19:02.24 And then they can hardly live with it.
00:19:02.24 --> 00:19:07.16 But I would say, despite that, and I would say also that this is the central idea in
00:19:07.16 --> 00:19:13.92 the in 12 rules for life is that despite that, bottomless horror in some sense, there
00:19:13.92 --> 00:19:22.60 is a way of being that's powerful enough to both transcend and justify that in some sense.
00:19:22.60 --> 00:19:32.56 And that has to do with the decision to act as if it would be better if things were better.
00:19:32.56 --> 00:19:33.56 That's the first thing.
00:19:33.56 --> 00:19:34.56 And you think, well, that's easy.
00:19:34.56 --> 00:19:35.56 I'd like things to be better.
00:19:35.56 --> 00:19:37.44 No, no, wait a second.
00:19:37.44 --> 00:19:42.04 There's hatred in your heart and there's resentment in your soul.
00:19:42.04 --> 00:19:44.52 And there's bitterness at your position in the world.
00:19:44.52 --> 00:19:46.16 And there's the sense that you're a victim.
00:19:46.16 --> 00:19:48.44 And there's the anger that goes along with that.
00:19:48.44 --> 00:19:50.92 And the desire to hurt, like you have all of that.
00:19:50.92 --> 00:19:54.96 And maybe you have it in spades, maybe it's mostly what you are.
00:19:54.96 --> 00:19:57.64 And because of that, you do not want things to be better.
00:19:57.64 --> 00:20:00.16 You want to spread some misery out of spite.
00:20:00.16 --> 00:20:01.96 And that's what chapter six is about, right?
00:20:01.96 --> 00:20:04.52 Put your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.
00:20:04.52 --> 00:20:07.12 It's about people like the Call of Mind High School shooters.
00:20:07.12 --> 00:20:09.20 And exactly what they were motivated by.
00:20:09.20 --> 00:20:11.60 Because I understand what they were motivated by.
00:20:11.60 --> 00:20:16.84 And so to wish that things were better means that you have to make a real decision that
00:20:16.84 --> 00:20:25.44 despite all the flaws of existence, the suffering and the malevolence that it's best not
00:20:25.44 --> 00:20:29.68 to become embedded by that and to work for the betterment of everyone.
00:20:29.68 --> 00:20:33.84 You, for sure, your family, for sure, your community.
00:20:33.84 --> 00:20:35.92 But perhaps even your enemies.
00:20:35.92 --> 00:20:39.84 You know, if you have any sense, you wish your enemies well.
00:20:39.84 --> 00:20:42.64 It doesn't mean you wish them victory.
00:20:42.64 --> 00:20:45.12 It doesn't mean you don't think they're wrong.
00:20:45.12 --> 00:20:46.12 None of that.
00:20:46.12 --> 00:20:51.80 It means that it would be better if the world was set up so that they didn't have to suffer
00:20:51.80 --> 00:20:55.04 miserably and futile and evenly as well.
00:20:55.04 --> 00:20:56.36 That would be better.
00:20:56.36 --> 00:20:58.36 And so then you can aim at that.
00:20:58.36 --> 00:21:02.24 You know, and the best way to aim at that is, well, first of all, they aim at it to actually
00:21:02.24 --> 00:21:07.32 sort yourself out and think, okay, well, if I could have things the way I wanted them to be,
00:21:07.32 --> 00:21:09.32 that's what I would want.
00:21:09.32 --> 00:21:17.72 And that takes a lot of psychological organization before you can state that without, without
00:21:17.72 --> 00:21:21.52 what would you say, without holding anything back, you know, because there's that part
00:21:21.52 --> 00:21:27.84 of you that better part that wants vengeance and wants to wreak havoc.
00:21:27.84 --> 00:21:29.08 That's there.
00:21:29.08 --> 00:21:31.000 It's hard to constrain that.
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.80 And then, well, the other part along with this, as well as aiming at the highest good
00:21:36.80 --> 00:21:42.48 that's attainable, let's say, is to also decide that you're going to speak the truth
00:21:42.48 --> 00:21:48.68 in that endeavor and to risk that, you know, and because I think those are the things
00:21:48.68 --> 00:21:50.68 that help you aren't yourself properly.
00:21:50.68 --> 00:21:54.36 That's the message on the sermon on the mount by the way, which is aim at the highest
00:21:54.36 --> 00:22:02.64 good that you can conceive of and act and tell the truth in that pursuit, right?
00:22:02.64 --> 00:22:09.72 The other element there is to focus on the day once you've aligned yourself with the heavenly
00:22:09.72 --> 00:22:10.72 star, right?
00:22:10.72 --> 00:22:12.88 Aim high and then focus on the day.
00:22:12.88 --> 00:22:16.80 That's very good advice, because it also embuees everything you do in your daily life
00:22:16.80 --> 00:22:19.20 with significance, that's the why am I doing this?
00:22:19.20 --> 00:22:21.72 To avoid hell, that's a good one.
00:22:21.72 --> 00:22:22.72 Let's start with that.
00:22:22.72 --> 00:22:23.96 It's like to avoid hell.
00:22:23.96 --> 00:22:28.56 And if you have any imagination at all, if you live in the world at all, if you're not naive,
00:22:28.56 --> 00:22:29.56 you know what that means.
00:22:29.56 --> 00:22:33.08 And it's not just the hell that you encounter, it's the hell that you foolishly produce
00:22:33.08 --> 00:22:35.96 around yourself and are then responsible for.
00:22:35.96 --> 00:22:38.32 That's a perfect, a good sort of hell.
00:22:38.32 --> 00:22:40.60 So you want to avoid that, for sure.
00:22:40.60 --> 00:22:45.04 And maybe you want to dare risking making things better.
00:22:45.04 --> 00:22:48.36 It's like that'll embue your life with significance.
00:22:48.36 --> 00:22:52.96 And that significance, you know, one of the things I've discovered learned, I would say,
00:22:52.96 --> 00:22:58.56 over the last 25 years, is that there's always been a mythological idea or an idea and literature
00:22:58.56 --> 00:23:04.44 and philosophy that there was a shining path, you know, that you could walk down and modern
00:23:04.44 --> 00:23:09.40 cynical people believe that that sort of meaning, the meaning that would be obtained by
00:23:09.40 --> 00:23:12.72 walking on that path is somehow a loseery or arbitrary.
00:23:12.72 --> 00:23:16.32 And I don't think there's any evidence whatsoever that that's true.
00:23:16.32 --> 00:23:23.92 I think that sense of meaningful engagement, that what is revealed to you when you're in the
00:23:23.92 --> 00:23:28.24 right place at the right time, doing the right thing, that sense of deep engagement, that
00:23:28.24 --> 00:23:33.76 loss of self-consciousness, that feeling that things are worthwhile, that deep seated feeling
00:23:33.76 --> 00:23:35.44 that things are worthwhile.
00:23:35.44 --> 00:23:37.60 That's the most real thing.
00:23:37.60 --> 00:23:41.88 I think the neurobiological evidence suggests that.
00:23:41.88 --> 00:23:43.60 I really do believe that.
00:23:43.60 --> 00:23:47.24 And so we're in a fortunate time in some sense because we can look at those old metaphorical
00:23:47.24 --> 00:23:52.84 ideas of the of the shining path, let's say the the golden path forward.
00:23:52.84 --> 00:23:56.96 And we can say, yeah, that's actually real.
00:23:56.96 --> 00:23:57.96 It's real.
00:23:57.96 --> 00:23:58.96 That's something.
00:23:58.96 --> 00:24:03.000 And then that's what's so cool about that in my estimation is that and this is why
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.28 12 rules for life is actually an optimistic book.
00:24:05.28 --> 00:24:09.92 It's like the darkness is real, but the light is stronger.
00:24:09.92 --> 00:24:12.12 It's like, wow, could that be true?
00:24:12.12 --> 00:24:13.68 Could that possibly be true?
00:24:13.68 --> 00:24:15.48 I think it's true.
00:24:15.48 --> 00:24:18.72 So that's a good thing to know, man, that that might be true.
00:24:18.72 --> 00:24:23.40 And you know, when I was talking about my friend in the beginning of this podcast, that's
00:24:23.40 --> 00:24:31.92 why I was talking about it because it was a guy who had every reason to be negative and
00:24:31.92 --> 00:24:36.52 to be dark and to look at the world and just say, this is hell, it's not worth it.
00:24:36.52 --> 00:24:40.20 But instead, what he really did was want to take care of his friends.
00:24:40.20 --> 00:24:42.20 I talked about a woman in my book.
00:24:42.20 --> 00:24:47.32 It's like someone I met as a client when I was just beginning my psychotherapy to practice.
00:24:47.32 --> 00:24:49.04 And she just blew me away.
00:24:49.04 --> 00:24:50.04 I've never forgotten her.
00:24:50.04 --> 00:24:53.92 So she had a horrible life.
00:24:53.92 --> 00:25:00.88 She was unattractive, uneducated, no career, unemployed.
00:25:00.88 --> 00:25:03.12 So shy, you can't even imagine it.
00:25:03.12 --> 00:25:04.60 Like you've met someone shy and anxious.
00:25:04.60 --> 00:25:07.16 It's like they weren't in the same universe as this woman.
00:25:07.16 --> 00:25:12.12 She was so shy that she couldn't walk up to people without looking at the ground,
00:25:12.12 --> 00:25:14.48 hunching over and shielding her eyes.
00:25:14.48 --> 00:25:17.52 So that's how she approached people on the street.
00:25:17.52 --> 00:25:21.24 And she looked like a homeless person as well.
00:25:21.24 --> 00:25:26.04 And so she came to the behavior therapy unit that I was working at.
00:25:26.04 --> 00:25:30.28 And hypothetically for treatment.
00:25:30.28 --> 00:25:34.12 And so what we started doing was seeing if we could get her to stand up a bit and look
00:25:34.12 --> 00:25:40.08 people in the eye more normally so that people wouldn't respond to her as if she was so peculiar.
00:25:40.08 --> 00:25:42.04 You know, so we're trying to just to change your behavior.
00:25:42.04 --> 00:25:45.84 But I started talking to her and she told me a little bit about her life.
00:25:45.84 --> 00:25:50.08 It's like she lived at her where she lived.
00:25:50.08 --> 00:25:55.52 Her mother was, I think she lived with her aunt who was like a violent schizophrenic alcoholic
00:25:55.52 --> 00:26:00.52 who had religious delusions and constantly accused her of being possessed by the devil.
00:26:00.52 --> 00:26:06.48 And she had a really violent and abusive alcoholic boyfriend who used to mistreat this woman.
00:26:06.48 --> 00:26:07.88 So that was like, whole life.
00:26:07.88 --> 00:26:09.80 It's like, yeah.
00:26:09.80 --> 00:26:13.28 And she had been an inpatient in this hospital, the Douglas hospital.
00:26:13.28 --> 00:26:16.36 And that was in the 1980s.
00:26:16.36 --> 00:26:20.20 And the Douglas hospital was a huge hospital, both sides of a university campus.
00:26:20.20 --> 00:26:25.52 And it had had a lot of inpatients, but they were all led out on the streets when medication
00:26:25.52 --> 00:26:26.92 became widely available.
00:26:26.92 --> 00:26:30.000 And when deinstitutionalization was the norm.
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.12 But there was a subset of them who couldn't be deinstitutionalized.
00:26:33.12 --> 00:26:36.48 And these were people that you can hardly imagine.
00:26:36.48 --> 00:26:41.24 So I used to go in the underground corridors in the Douglas hospital because it's very cold
00:26:41.24 --> 00:26:44.32 in Montreal, so they're underground corridors collecting the buildings and down there.
00:26:44.32 --> 00:26:46.84 There would be vending machines and places for people to sit.
00:26:46.84 --> 00:26:49.36 And it was like walking through Dante's inferno.
00:26:49.36 --> 00:26:51.68 Because these were people who were so damaged.
00:26:51.68 --> 00:26:55.04 They'd been in psychiatric institution for maybe two or three decades.
00:26:55.04 --> 00:26:59.80 They could not be released no matter what, even though that's what the hospital was trying
00:26:59.80 --> 00:27:00.80 to do.
00:27:00.80 --> 00:27:05.72 And so it was like Diane Arba, used to go across the United States and photograph strange
00:27:05.72 --> 00:27:06.72 people.
00:27:06.72 --> 00:27:08.28 And she has a whole collection of her photographs.
00:27:08.28 --> 00:27:10.92 They're quite arresting and shocking.
00:27:10.92 --> 00:27:14.64 It was like walking through Diane Arba's universe.
00:27:14.64 --> 00:27:15.88 And so those were the inpatient.
00:27:15.88 --> 00:27:19.96 And she had been an inpatient from time to time, but was well enough so she could also
00:27:19.96 --> 00:27:20.96 go out.
00:27:20.96 --> 00:27:23.44 And it turned out she didn't actually want treatment.
00:27:23.44 --> 00:27:24.84 She had this dog.
00:27:24.84 --> 00:27:26.12 She used to take it for walks.
00:27:26.12 --> 00:27:28.68 And so that was her source of enjoyment.
00:27:28.68 --> 00:27:31.88 And she thought, I really liked this dog.
00:27:31.88 --> 00:27:33.72 And I really liked taking it for walks.
00:27:33.72 --> 00:27:39.32 And maybe I could go to the Douglas hospital and find one of these inpatients and take
00:27:39.32 --> 00:27:40.32 him out for a walk.
00:27:40.32 --> 00:27:41.84 Maybe that would be a good thing for him.
00:27:41.84 --> 00:27:45.88 And so the reason she had come to the behavior therapy clinic wasn't to treat all of her
00:27:45.88 --> 00:27:46.88 problems.
00:27:46.88 --> 00:27:49.56 And like this woman had problems, man.
00:27:49.56 --> 00:27:51.36 Everything about her life was a problem.
00:27:51.36 --> 00:27:55.88 In ways that like a normal person just cannot begin to understand, you know.
00:27:55.88 --> 00:27:59.08 Unless they're in one of those situations in their life where everything is collapsing
00:27:59.08 --> 00:28:00.08 around them.
00:28:00.08 --> 00:28:04.68 And what she did, what she decided was, well, there's someone worse off that me than
00:28:04.68 --> 00:28:06.08 me that I could help.
00:28:06.08 --> 00:28:09.52 It's like, she just absolutely blew me away.
00:28:09.52 --> 00:28:11.68 This poor woman, she had nothing going for her.
00:28:11.68 --> 00:28:15.64 Well, I guess she did it because she had this nobility of spirit that was absolutely
00:28:15.64 --> 00:28:16.64 indomitable.
00:28:16.64 --> 00:28:19.32 It's just I never forgot that.
00:28:19.32 --> 00:28:20.32 It just blew me away.
00:28:20.32 --> 00:28:22.44 How lead her into her situation in a way.
00:28:22.44 --> 00:28:24.56 So no one wants to help her.
00:28:24.56 --> 00:28:27.56 Her aunt that's all crazy and you know what that is.
00:28:27.56 --> 00:28:29.96 She wants to help prop up her boyfriend that's violent.
00:28:29.96 --> 00:28:30.96 No, I don't think so.
00:28:30.96 --> 00:28:32.56 I don't think she wanted any of that.
00:28:32.56 --> 00:28:33.96 She was just one of these people.
00:28:33.96 --> 00:28:40.000 It's like, you know, you can put someone in a situation that's so dire that there's
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.40 virtually no escape from it.
00:28:41.40 --> 00:28:46.60 Like I've seen people in my clinical practice for whom things around them have collapsed
00:28:46.60 --> 00:28:50.04 so badly that there's just no fixing it.
00:28:50.04 --> 00:28:53.72 You fix one thing and two other things break and then you fix those and three other things
00:28:53.72 --> 00:28:54.72 break.
00:28:54.72 --> 00:28:55.72 There's just no bottom.
00:28:55.72 --> 00:29:01.84 And those are often families that have had multi-generational problems.
00:29:01.84 --> 00:29:04.56 Basically rooted the whole community is pathologized.
00:29:04.56 --> 00:29:08.28 The entire family structure is demolished.
00:29:08.28 --> 00:29:12.28 There people don't have any marketable skills and they haven't for generations.
00:29:12.28 --> 00:29:18.96 The whole situation is complicated by drug and alcohol abuse and heavily biologically influenced
00:29:18.96 --> 00:29:20.36 insanity of one form.
00:29:20.36 --> 00:29:24.44 Another usually can join with relatively low cognitive ability.
00:29:24.44 --> 00:29:27.84 It's just hell no matter which way you turn.
00:29:27.84 --> 00:29:30.80 I didn't see her as a contributor to that.
00:29:30.80 --> 00:29:35.96 I mean I'm sure she made her mistakes like everyone else but she wasn't playing martyr
00:29:35.96 --> 00:29:37.48 or victim.
00:29:37.48 --> 00:29:42.68 She didn't come into the clinic to complain, to begin with.
00:29:42.68 --> 00:29:46.40 She was just telling me these were the situation that she lived in.
00:29:46.40 --> 00:29:48.04 She wasn't.
00:29:48.04 --> 00:29:49.44 That isn't what she was there for.
00:29:49.44 --> 00:29:53.32 It's just that we thought she had come for treatment so we were doing background analysis,
00:29:53.32 --> 00:29:55.92 you know, an intake interview and found out all these things.
00:29:55.92 --> 00:30:00.40 It's like any one of those problems is enough to bring most people's lives to a
00:30:00.40 --> 00:30:03.24 shuddering halt and yet that was her vision.
00:30:03.24 --> 00:30:06.08 So the reason she had come to the hospital and she didn't just come to the behavior
00:30:06.08 --> 00:30:07.08 of therapy clinic.
00:30:07.08 --> 00:30:12.28 She had gone around pestering administrators in the hospital to let her take the long
00:30:12.28 --> 00:30:13.88 term inmates out for a walk.
00:30:13.88 --> 00:30:17.12 Now they wouldn't do it for all sorts of reasons.
00:30:17.12 --> 00:30:21.60 But that didn't stop her from thinking it was a good idea and it actually was a good
00:30:21.60 --> 00:30:22.60 idea.
00:30:22.60 --> 00:30:23.60 This was a practical idea.
00:30:23.60 --> 00:30:27.12 Like she could have taken people out on the grounds because the grounds were huge and
00:30:27.12 --> 00:30:28.72 walked them with the dog.
00:30:28.72 --> 00:30:29.72 And it would have been fine for.
00:30:29.72 --> 00:30:32.16 There's such a thing as pet therapy in 1985.
00:30:32.16 --> 00:30:33.96 That's not a huge sort of a head of a heart.
00:30:33.96 --> 00:30:34.96 Yeah, well, right.
00:30:34.96 --> 00:30:35.96 Exactly.
00:30:35.96 --> 00:30:41.24 But she had enough wear with all to notice that, well, that she liked the dog and the dog
00:30:41.24 --> 00:30:42.24 like turned out.
00:30:42.24 --> 00:30:43.24 That was a good thing, right?
00:30:43.24 --> 00:30:46.48 A little bit of love in the world there and that there was nothing wrong with taking
00:30:46.48 --> 00:30:50.48 the dog for a walk and that was kind of harmless and why not have someone long.
00:30:50.48 --> 00:30:51.72 They made her feel good.
00:30:51.72 --> 00:30:53.68 She thought, well, maybe it'll make the right sense of feel.
00:30:53.68 --> 00:30:54.68 Exactly.
00:30:54.68 --> 00:30:57.64 So like, you just got to shake your head.
00:30:57.64 --> 00:31:01.64 Well, that's when I really learned to begin with deeply that there's no correlation
00:31:01.64 --> 00:31:03.72 between intelligence and wisdom.
00:31:03.72 --> 00:31:08.04 And that's actually the case, technically like if you're smart, you can just be like,
00:31:08.04 --> 00:31:11.72 you can be smart and good, but you can be smart and bad.
00:31:11.72 --> 00:31:12.72 It's just a, yeah.
00:31:12.72 --> 00:31:13.72 That's it.
00:31:13.72 --> 00:31:15.92 Well, we used to say, okay, so we'd get these guys coming in the sealed teams.
00:31:15.92 --> 00:31:20.44 That would be for a while we were recruiting just the for the officer candidates.
00:31:20.44 --> 00:31:24.16 We were creating these guys that were, you know, they went to Ivy League schools and they were
00:31:24.16 --> 00:31:28.56 off the charts and 1600 on their SATs and then they were the captain of this and they were
00:31:28.56 --> 00:31:32.76 just these really high achievers.
00:31:32.76 --> 00:31:36.88 And we found that not all of them, but certainly some of them couldn't really function
00:31:36.88 --> 00:31:41.96 in the as a leader in the job because they just didn't have the, I guess the wisdom
00:31:41.96 --> 00:31:44.96 to pull it off, but they couldn't make the personal connections.
00:31:44.96 --> 00:31:46.36 They couldn't develop a relationship.
00:31:46.36 --> 00:31:49.48 The leadership's a complicated thing and it doesn't boil down just two intelligence.
00:31:49.48 --> 00:31:50.48 Yeah.
00:31:50.48 --> 00:31:51.84 And I don't want to make it sound like none of them.
00:31:51.84 --> 00:31:56.12 Or because some were obviously outstanding, incredible leaders, but there are some of them
00:31:56.12 --> 00:31:59.96 that would be the same kind of recruit, but they just would just missing whatever piece
00:31:59.96 --> 00:32:00.96 that was.
00:32:00.96 --> 00:32:03.96 Well, intelligence and character are definitely not the same thing.
00:32:03.96 --> 00:32:04.96 They're not the same thing.
00:32:04.96 --> 00:32:09.04 I mean, all things considered if you're going to pick one of two leaders, if I would
00:32:09.04 --> 00:32:13.28 pick the smarter leader over the dollar leader, if all other things were equal, you know,
00:32:13.28 --> 00:32:18.44 because, well, because someone who's more intelligent can strategize more rapidly and
00:32:18.44 --> 00:32:20.16 can handle more variables, right?
00:32:20.16 --> 00:32:25.44 And perhaps can even handle, well, can handle a more rapid rate of transformation as
00:32:25.44 --> 00:32:27.92 well, and sometimes that's actually crucial.
00:32:27.92 --> 00:32:32.12 But character and intelligence are, are, they're clearly not the same thing.
00:32:32.12 --> 00:32:35.92 And character is actually, well, I don't think anything trumps character.
00:32:35.92 --> 00:32:36.92 That's that.
00:32:36.92 --> 00:32:37.92 Character is everything.
00:32:37.92 --> 00:32:41.36 So, you know, it's interesting that you, with this, this woman that you talked about
00:32:41.36 --> 00:32:46.04 in the beginning, you talk about how she's, you know, she's crowd-stown and she's looking
00:32:46.04 --> 00:32:47.32 down with the ground and all that.
00:32:47.32 --> 00:32:55.000 So it's interesting in your rules, obviously, the first rule is to stand up straight
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.20 with your shoulders back, right?
00:32:57.20 --> 00:33:01.40 Well, when you get, for lack of a better word, indoctrinated, in fact, there is no better
00:33:01.40 --> 00:33:02.40 word.
00:33:02.40 --> 00:33:04.96 When you get indoctrinated into the military, that's exactly what's happening.
00:33:04.96 --> 00:33:05.96 And guess what?
00:33:05.96 --> 00:33:10.000 You get taught one of the first things that you get taught is how to stand, how to stand
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000 properly.
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.08 And you know what they tell you?
00:33:13.08 --> 00:33:15.08 Chin up, chest out, shoulders back.
00:33:15.08 --> 00:33:17.56 They make you stand like that.
00:33:17.56 --> 00:33:18.96 There's no coincidence to that is there.
00:33:18.96 --> 00:33:19.96 Not at all.
00:33:19.96 --> 00:33:20.96 No, no.
00:33:20.96 --> 00:33:25.64 It's a, you could say it's a dominant stance, but that's not the right way of thinking about
00:33:25.64 --> 00:33:26.64 it.
00:33:26.64 --> 00:33:30.44 Although it is a dominant stance, the reason to adopt it is not because it's a dominant
00:33:30.44 --> 00:33:31.44 stance.
00:33:31.44 --> 00:33:33.56 It's a competent stance.
00:33:33.56 --> 00:33:38.20 And competence tends to make you dominant, at least in hierarchies that are functioning
00:33:38.20 --> 00:33:39.20 properly.
00:33:39.20 --> 00:33:42.76 Because you want, there are hierarchies, which is what I outlined in chapter one.
00:33:42.76 --> 00:33:44.88 And I say the hierarchies are old.
00:33:44.88 --> 00:33:47.20 They're not sociocultural constructions.
00:33:47.20 --> 00:33:50.76 They're not a secondary consequence of capitalism in the free market.
00:33:50.76 --> 00:33:53.32 All of that is absolute nonsense.
00:33:53.32 --> 00:33:55.20 It couldn't be more wrong.
00:33:55.20 --> 00:34:01.16 And as an indication of that, I point out that Lobsters, whom we diverged from on the evolutionary
00:34:01.16 --> 00:34:05.52 front, a third of a billion years ago, have hierarchies.
00:34:05.52 --> 00:34:11.72 And that the neurochemical systems, the neurological systems that Lobsters have run
00:34:11.72 --> 00:34:17.40 well, that mediate their hierarchical status, run on the same chemical, that the neurological
00:34:17.40 --> 00:34:20.76 systems that we use to mediate hierarchy run on.
00:34:20.76 --> 00:34:23.08 So that's just absolutely mind boggling.
00:34:23.08 --> 00:34:28.28 But Lobster, like a victorious Lobster, stretches out and adopts a more dominant post.
00:34:28.28 --> 00:34:33.000 Because his serotonin levels go up as he becomes more and more victorious.
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.72 And that governs posture.
00:34:34.72 --> 00:34:39.72 Well, and so to stand up straight with your shoulders back is to open yourself up to
00:34:39.72 --> 00:34:40.72 the world.
00:34:40.72 --> 00:34:45.92 If you're not in the defensive crouch of a prey animal, technically speak it, and that
00:34:45.92 --> 00:34:47.92 is the circuitry that's governing posture.
00:34:47.92 --> 00:34:51.96 It's prey versus predator or something like that.
00:34:51.96 --> 00:34:58.44 And to stand up like that is to expose yourself to the world, but in a bring it on
00:34:58.44 --> 00:35:03.40 sort of manner, not precisely combative, but let's say courageous.
00:35:03.40 --> 00:35:05.36 And your posture announces that.
00:35:05.36 --> 00:35:08.24 And it doesn't just announce that to other people.
00:35:08.24 --> 00:35:11.32 It announces that to yourself and it can start.
00:35:11.32 --> 00:35:15.64 It can be one of those things that can start a virtuous cycle.
00:35:15.64 --> 00:35:18.000 Ocaric, which is partly why it's taught in the military.
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000 Get these guys that come in.
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.28 They're all slumped over.
00:35:20.28 --> 00:35:21.48 They don't know how to stand up.
00:35:21.48 --> 00:35:22.64 They're looking at their feet.
00:35:22.64 --> 00:35:23.84 They're next or bent.
00:35:23.84 --> 00:35:27.72 Like, even if they're good looking men, they don't look good because they're all crunched
00:35:27.72 --> 00:35:28.72 over.
00:35:28.72 --> 00:35:30.16 You see people like this on the street all the time.
00:35:30.16 --> 00:35:33.48 They could be perfectly attractive, except they're completely huddled in.
00:35:33.48 --> 00:35:36.44 And they need to stand up and stretch themselves out.
00:35:36.44 --> 00:35:37.96 And then they can breathe too.
00:35:37.96 --> 00:35:40.20 And that's a competent stance.
00:35:40.20 --> 00:35:46.08 One of the things that the critics of the modern West don't understand about hierarchies
00:35:46.08 --> 00:35:48.12 is that first of all, they're everywhere.
00:35:48.12 --> 00:35:49.12 They're inevitable.
00:35:49.12 --> 00:35:53.68 If you're going to have a distinction of value between things, you have a hierarchy.
00:35:53.68 --> 00:35:57.04 And if you don't want to get rid of the distinction of values between things because
00:35:57.04 --> 00:35:58.48 then you don't have anything to do.
00:35:58.48 --> 00:35:59.48 That's foolish.
00:35:59.48 --> 00:36:01.96 You can't live that way.
00:36:01.96 --> 00:36:05.48 So I say, well, the hierarchies are based on power.
00:36:05.48 --> 00:36:07.000 It's like, no, they're not.
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.08 They're based on competence.
00:36:09.08 --> 00:36:11.68 And there isn't anything more powerful than competence.
00:36:11.68 --> 00:36:13.20 But power isn't tyranny.
00:36:13.20 --> 00:36:14.48 It's not brutality.
00:36:14.48 --> 00:36:15.64 It's not threat.
00:36:15.64 --> 00:36:18.36 It might be the hint of all those things.
00:36:18.36 --> 00:36:22.52 Because I don't think you can be fully competent without being able to hint at those things.
00:36:22.52 --> 00:36:26.96 But hierarchies in the West are fundamentally based on competence.
00:36:26.96 --> 00:36:29.60 It doesn't mean they're not flawed because we miss the mark.
00:36:29.60 --> 00:36:30.60 Lots.
00:36:30.60 --> 00:36:34.56 And there's lots of reasons why perfectly competent people don't attain the position that
00:36:34.56 --> 00:36:38.88 they deserve and that they should have for their benefit in everyone else's.
00:36:38.88 --> 00:36:41.48 The hierarchies are tainted by corruption.
00:36:41.48 --> 00:36:46.52 But fundamentally, they're fundamentally based on competence.
00:36:46.52 --> 00:36:47.52 And that's.
00:36:47.52 --> 00:36:52.08 So with that, this first rule that you put in about book.
00:36:52.08 --> 00:36:54.24 And you're saying that's a cycle that can go backwards.
00:36:54.24 --> 00:36:56.72 So you don't have to have the serotonin first.
00:36:56.72 --> 00:36:57.72 And then you stand up.
00:36:57.72 --> 00:37:01.28 If you stand up straight, you'll somehow increase your serotonin over that.
00:37:01.28 --> 00:37:02.28 Yeah, definitely.
00:37:02.28 --> 00:37:03.28 Definitely.
00:37:03.28 --> 00:37:08.28 So you say you could inject lobsters with serotonin and they start to stand straighter.
00:37:08.28 --> 00:37:11.12 Yeah, you can basically give them anti-depressants.
00:37:11.12 --> 00:37:15.76 So like if a lobster gets defeated in a fight, then he's statistically more likely to
00:37:15.76 --> 00:37:19.80 lose the next fight than you would guess from a telly of his previous victories.
00:37:19.80 --> 00:37:21.44 So that's the first thing.
00:37:21.44 --> 00:37:24.84 If you lose, you increase your risk of further loss.
00:37:24.84 --> 00:37:27.32 But if you win, you increase your risk of future gains.
00:37:27.32 --> 00:37:29.04 That's a very important principle.
00:37:29.04 --> 00:37:30.68 It's a crucially important principle.
00:37:30.68 --> 00:37:31.96 It governs life.
00:37:31.96 --> 00:37:35.92 But yeah, if you take a lobster and he gets all defeated and he's off pouting and won't
00:37:35.92 --> 00:37:41.68 fight anymore because he's having a bad day and you inject him with serotonin, essentially
00:37:41.68 --> 00:37:42.68 give him anti-depressants.
00:37:42.68 --> 00:37:43.68 It's the same thing.
00:37:43.68 --> 00:37:46.20 Then he'll straighten up and he'll go out and have another scrap.
00:37:46.20 --> 00:37:48.20 And I read that, oh, I don't know.
00:37:48.20 --> 00:37:53.64 It's probably at least 10 years ago when I was reading about the neurophysiology of these
00:37:53.64 --> 00:37:56.16 neurochemical systems, that's why I go it onto it.
00:37:56.16 --> 00:37:57.96 It just was another thing that just blew me away.
00:37:57.96 --> 00:37:59.28 I thought, really, you're kidding.
00:37:59.28 --> 00:38:00.60 That circuit is that old.
00:38:00.60 --> 00:38:05.04 It's like it's that old, that's way before there were trees.
00:38:05.04 --> 00:38:06.84 That's how long ago that is.
00:38:06.84 --> 00:38:11.88 So hierarchy is a patriarchal construction.
00:38:11.88 --> 00:38:12.88 How about no?
00:38:12.88 --> 00:38:15.72 How about that's wrong and seriously wrong.
00:38:15.72 --> 00:38:18.60 So I was talking to one of my friends in the last year's show.
00:38:18.60 --> 00:38:20.000 He's got a kid that's wrestling.
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.44 His kid is six years old, I think.
00:38:22.44 --> 00:38:27.08 Dom and he says, you know, he's getting put into the higher category.
00:38:27.08 --> 00:38:29.28 He's kind of getting his butt whip now.
00:38:29.28 --> 00:38:30.92 And I'm really not sure what do you think.
00:38:30.92 --> 00:38:35.60 And I said, well, you want him to win because when he wins, it's more fun.
00:38:35.60 --> 00:38:36.60 And he has more fun.
00:38:36.60 --> 00:38:40.68 So now I have actual more evidence that you should get your kids in a position.
00:38:40.68 --> 00:38:42.80 Again, I think your kids should get beat sometimes.
00:38:42.80 --> 00:38:43.80 Yeah.
00:38:43.80 --> 00:38:47.40 But they should certainly not get beat down all the time.
00:38:47.40 --> 00:38:48.40 Exactly.
00:38:48.40 --> 00:38:50.32 I did that to my kids when my kids first started you, Jitu.
00:38:50.32 --> 00:38:53.52 I put them, oh, you're going to compete because I'm telling you to.
00:38:53.52 --> 00:38:54.52 Yeah.
00:38:54.52 --> 00:38:57.04 And then I'm going to put you in a higher weight class with older kids.
00:38:57.04 --> 00:38:58.20 Because that's going to make you tougher.
00:38:58.20 --> 00:39:00.80 That was my, you know, stupid thinking.
00:39:00.80 --> 00:39:04.24 And now with my younger start, I'm like, no, no, no, you go out and you have fun.
00:39:04.24 --> 00:39:07.36 And you go out and you compete against people that are somewhat equal to you.
00:39:07.36 --> 00:39:08.80 Maybe a little bit below you, maybe a little higher.
00:39:08.80 --> 00:39:10.40 But depending on your mood, time.
00:39:10.40 --> 00:39:11.40 Yeah.
00:39:11.40 --> 00:39:12.40 Yeah.
00:39:12.40 --> 00:39:13.40 Well, that's absolutely.
00:39:13.40 --> 00:39:17.48 Well, that's I think we could, we can think about that also in terms of the conversation
00:39:17.48 --> 00:39:19.12 about meaning that we started to have.
00:39:19.12 --> 00:39:22.32 It's like, if you win all the time, that's meaningless.
00:39:22.32 --> 00:39:24.000 Because, well, I mean, think why?
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000 Because you want to win.
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.16 It's like, yeah, fair enough.
00:39:27.16 --> 00:39:29.60 So why would winning all the time become meaningless?
00:39:29.60 --> 00:39:33.28 It's because your theory of winning isn't sophisticated enough.
00:39:33.28 --> 00:39:35.48 Because here's how you win.
00:39:35.48 --> 00:39:38.000 You play the game to win.
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.76 But while you're playing, you play in a way so that you get better at the game.
00:39:41.76 --> 00:39:42.76 Right?
00:39:42.76 --> 00:39:43.76 Because you're going to play a bunch of games.
00:39:43.76 --> 00:39:44.76 Well, it's even more than that.
00:39:44.76 --> 00:39:48.08 You play the game to win, but you play it so that you get better at the game.
00:39:48.08 --> 00:39:49.56 Okay, fine, that makes sense.
00:39:49.56 --> 00:39:51.04 So you want to push yourself, right?
00:39:51.04 --> 00:39:52.04 Because that's how you get better.
00:39:52.04 --> 00:39:53.84 And so you need competition to push yourself.
00:39:53.84 --> 00:39:55.88 So you need to have the risk of loss.
00:39:55.88 --> 00:39:57.12 Because otherwise you won't do it.
00:39:57.12 --> 00:39:59.64 But here's an even better way of thinking about it.
00:39:59.64 --> 00:40:03.88 You play the game so that you don't only get better at that game, but you get better at
00:40:03.88 --> 00:40:06.36 the entire set of possible games.
00:40:06.36 --> 00:40:08.04 And that's what you do when you're a good sport.
00:40:08.04 --> 00:40:09.56 It's like, well, so how do you do that?
00:40:09.56 --> 00:40:13.80 Well, partly, you find the proper level of competition.
00:40:13.80 --> 00:40:23.80 So you want to be pushed so that you will make the effort necessary to remove what's useless
00:40:23.80 --> 00:40:28.32 about yourself and to help foster the growth of what's useful.
00:40:28.32 --> 00:40:35.56 And if you do that, then you get the joy of participating in the game towards victory.
00:40:35.56 --> 00:40:41.92 But the extra joy of building yourself more and more strongly at the same time.
00:40:41.92 --> 00:40:45.84 And so when you tell your kid, doesn't matter whether you win or lose.
00:40:45.84 --> 00:40:47.32 It's how you play the game.
00:40:47.32 --> 00:40:49.60 Your kid says, what do you mean by that?
00:40:49.60 --> 00:40:51.88 And you say, I don't know.
00:40:51.88 --> 00:40:54.20 I don't know what I mean by that.
00:40:54.20 --> 00:40:56.20 Because the kid says, I'm supposed to win, aren't I?
00:40:56.20 --> 00:40:57.20 It's like, well, yeah.
00:40:57.20 --> 00:40:59.20 So why does it matter how I play the game?
00:40:59.20 --> 00:41:00.88 It's like, well, then you're stumped.
00:41:00.88 --> 00:41:02.96 Even though you're right, you just don't know why.
00:41:02.96 --> 00:41:05.48 But the reason is, is you want to tell you, here's the reason.
00:41:05.48 --> 00:41:09.28 It's like, we can make this very simple.
00:41:09.28 --> 00:41:10.44 Life is not a game.
00:41:10.44 --> 00:41:11.44 It's a series of games.
00:41:11.44 --> 00:41:13.76 It's actually a series of diverse games.
00:41:13.76 --> 00:41:17.84 Okay, so who's the winner of this series of diverse games?
00:41:17.84 --> 00:41:19.24 Because that's the real question, right?
00:41:19.24 --> 00:41:20.56 Not who wins a game.
00:41:20.56 --> 00:41:22.44 It's like whatever you win a game.
00:41:22.44 --> 00:41:25.32 It's like, if I hold a gun to your head and we're playing chess,
00:41:25.32 --> 00:41:26.64 I could say lose.
00:41:26.64 --> 00:41:27.44 It's like I win.
00:41:27.44 --> 00:41:31.96 It's like, well, that's not how full, obviously.
00:41:31.96 --> 00:41:33.68 So you want to teach your kid.
00:41:33.68 --> 00:41:38.12 You want to help your kid learn to be the winner of the set of diverse games.
00:41:38.12 --> 00:41:39.76 Okay, so what does that winner look like?
00:41:39.76 --> 00:41:42.28 Well, here's the first clue.
00:41:42.28 --> 00:41:45.88 That's the person who keeps getting invited to play.
00:41:45.88 --> 00:41:49.96 So because you win, if people invite you to play all the time,
00:41:49.96 --> 00:41:52.96 you have opportunities coming to you just non-stop.
00:41:52.96 --> 00:41:56.52 And maybe, like, let's say you have 50 opportunities
00:41:56.52 --> 00:41:59.48 and each of them are potentially 50% for you
00:41:59.48 --> 00:42:01.28 and 50% for the other person.
00:42:01.28 --> 00:42:03.16 You think, well, that's pretty good deal.
00:42:03.16 --> 00:42:05.56 And then you think, well, wait a minute, let's flip this around.
00:42:05.56 --> 00:42:09.28 So it's like 60% for the other person and 40% for me.
00:42:09.28 --> 00:42:10.64 I'm gonna be like, I'm gonna go,
00:42:10.64 --> 00:42:12.88 I'm gonna overboard in the generosity.
00:42:12.88 --> 00:42:15.000 You think, well, then what happens?
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.96 Well, then instead of having 20 opportunities
00:42:16.96 --> 00:42:20.36 at every moment, you have like 50 opportunities at every moment.
00:42:20.36 --> 00:42:23.76 And that's what you want for your kids is you want
00:42:23.76 --> 00:42:26.68 all the invisible doors around them to open.
00:42:26.68 --> 00:42:31.28 And you do that by saying, play nobly, right?
00:42:31.28 --> 00:42:34.28 Pay attention to your teammates, pass the damn puck.
00:42:34.28 --> 00:42:35.52 So they get a chance, right?
00:42:35.52 --> 00:42:37.40 Even if you're the best player on the team,
00:42:37.40 --> 00:42:39.12 help the people on your team develop.
00:42:39.12 --> 00:42:41.32 Don't grandstand, right?
00:42:41.32 --> 00:42:46.32 If you have the opportunity to beat your opponent
00:42:46.32 --> 00:42:49.88 20 to one in goals, doesn't happen very often,
00:42:49.88 --> 00:42:51.44 but it can, especially when kids are playing.
00:42:51.44 --> 00:42:54.44 It's like, well, maybe after you're up seven to one,
00:42:54.44 --> 00:42:57.72 it's like, back off a bit.
00:42:57.72 --> 00:43:00.12 You don't have to humiliate your opponents.
00:43:00.12 --> 00:43:03.08 Because it's what would you say?
00:43:03.08 --> 00:43:06.52 It's contemptible behavior on your part.
00:43:06.52 --> 00:43:09.16 And so, you know that because you go and watch
00:43:09.16 --> 00:43:10.56 a hockey game or something like that,
00:43:10.56 --> 00:43:13.44 and you watch a kid that really knows how to play.
00:43:13.44 --> 00:43:15.44 It's like they're playing like mad to win.
00:43:15.44 --> 00:43:17.32 They're pushing themselves to be better,
00:43:17.32 --> 00:43:19.64 but they're paying attention to their damn teammates.
00:43:19.64 --> 00:43:22.20 And they respect their opponents.
00:43:22.20 --> 00:43:24.48 And you think, well, that's a hell of a kid there.
00:43:24.48 --> 00:43:26.20 It's like, yeah, that's exactly right.
00:43:26.20 --> 00:43:27.96 That kid's going somewhere.
00:43:27.96 --> 00:43:31.64 Do kids ever show, they get so committed.
00:43:31.64 --> 00:43:32.48 Let's say hockey, right?
00:43:32.48 --> 00:43:34.28 You get a kid that's just so committed to winning
00:43:34.28 --> 00:43:36.76 and hockey that he's gonna lose at other games?
00:43:36.76 --> 00:43:38.84 Well, that's another game's in life, right?
00:43:38.84 --> 00:43:39.68 That's another problem.
00:43:39.68 --> 00:43:40.88 Well, that's another problem is like...
00:43:40.88 --> 00:43:42.36 So you could be over-borg.
00:43:42.36 --> 00:43:44.24 Yeah, well, well, the other thing too
00:43:44.24 --> 00:43:46.08 is that with sports, like you could say,
00:43:46.08 --> 00:43:49.24 well, most kids aren't gonna be NHL level hockey players.
00:43:49.24 --> 00:43:50.36 Like, that's impossible.
00:43:50.36 --> 00:43:51.92 Like, maybe you should aim for that.
00:43:51.92 --> 00:43:54.80 I would say probably not, because it's so damn unlikely.
00:43:54.80 --> 00:43:57.08 But whatever, some kids are gonna manage that
00:43:57.08 --> 00:43:58.80 and more power to them.
00:43:58.80 --> 00:44:02.16 Say, well, what are the sports for the rest of the kids?
00:44:02.16 --> 00:44:03.76 And the answer to that is, well, obviously,
00:44:03.76 --> 00:44:05.76 there's the physical discipline and the health
00:44:05.76 --> 00:44:06.84 that goes along with that.
00:44:06.84 --> 00:44:10.68 And the ability to engage in and tolerate competition
00:44:10.68 --> 00:44:13.72 and learn how to be a gracious winner and a gracious loser.
00:44:13.72 --> 00:44:15.04 But a lot of it is correct.
00:44:15.04 --> 00:44:17.32 That all that's part of character building.
00:44:17.32 --> 00:44:18.52 Well, that's what you want.
00:44:18.52 --> 00:44:20.52 You say, well, why build your character?
00:44:20.52 --> 00:44:22.60 It's like, well, how about...
00:44:22.60 --> 00:44:27.84 That's your set of tools for dealing with catastrophe.
00:44:27.84 --> 00:44:29.56 How about that for a reason?
00:44:29.56 --> 00:44:30.40 Right?
00:44:30.40 --> 00:44:33.40 So one of the things I've suggested to my viewers,
00:44:33.40 --> 00:44:36.40 this is the man in particular, but not just the man,
00:44:36.40 --> 00:44:41.40 you should be the most reliable person at your father's funeral.
00:44:41.60 --> 00:44:43.28 That's a good goal, man.
00:44:43.28 --> 00:44:45.36 That's a good goal because everyone's broken
00:44:45.36 --> 00:44:46.92 in a situation like that.
00:44:46.92 --> 00:44:49.56 And you adding to that brokenness and misery.
00:44:49.56 --> 00:44:52.20 I mean, you're gonna be grieving, like, no doubt about it.
00:44:52.20 --> 00:44:53.88 And no kidding.
00:44:53.88 --> 00:44:57.60 But there is a time to step forward with some character.
00:44:57.60 --> 00:44:58.60 You know, it's the same thing.
00:44:58.60 --> 00:45:00.40 You're gonna be at someone's deathbed.
00:45:00.40 --> 00:45:01.88 You're gonna be quibbling with your siblings
00:45:01.88 --> 00:45:02.76 while you're doing that?
00:45:02.76 --> 00:45:04.44 Well, your parents dying?
00:45:04.44 --> 00:45:06.12 It's like, it's bad enough that they're dying.
00:45:06.12 --> 00:45:07.80 That's tragedy, right?
00:45:07.80 --> 00:45:10.36 But you'd can turn that into hell, no problem.
00:45:10.36 --> 00:45:13.32 You just get a bunch of people with no character around a deathbed.
00:45:13.32 --> 00:45:16.28 And it's like, well, it's bad enough,
00:45:16.28 --> 00:45:18.36 but that turns it into something like hell.
00:45:18.36 --> 00:45:20.64 And that happens in people's lives all the time.
00:45:20.64 --> 00:45:22.56 It's like character is everything.
00:45:22.56 --> 00:45:26.64 So, and that's why the wise people of our past tradition
00:45:26.64 --> 00:45:28.44 insisted upon that.
00:45:28.44 --> 00:45:29.60 You say, well, don't lie.
00:45:29.60 --> 00:45:30.44 Well, why not?
00:45:30.44 --> 00:45:31.84 Well, destroys your character.
00:45:31.84 --> 00:45:32.96 Well, so what?
00:45:32.96 --> 00:45:34.92 Well, then you turn suffering into hell.
00:45:34.92 --> 00:45:36.32 Is that what you want?
00:45:36.32 --> 00:45:39.64 Maybe, you know, because people will want that.
00:45:39.64 --> 00:45:44.64 But I would say walk away from people like that, right?
00:45:44.64 --> 00:45:48.84 That's not unless that's what you want, then.
00:45:48.84 --> 00:45:51.56 Yeah, you've got a lot of, I mean, it's interesting
00:45:51.56 --> 00:45:54.24 as since I just got done reading the book, you know,
00:45:54.24 --> 00:45:56.16 I can hear you just hitting the wave tropps
00:45:56.16 --> 00:45:58.52 of all the different rules and they're all interconnected
00:45:58.52 --> 00:46:03.52 about don't lie or tell the truth or at least don't lie.
00:46:03.52 --> 00:46:07.56 And then hang, what's the chapter about hang around with people
00:46:07.56 --> 00:46:08.56 that want to see you do well?
00:46:08.56 --> 00:46:09.56 Yeah, exactly.
00:46:09.56 --> 00:46:11.96 Yeah, yeah, make friends with people who want the best
00:46:11.96 --> 00:46:12.80 for you.
00:46:12.80 --> 00:46:13.80 Right.
00:46:13.80 --> 00:46:16.76 Yeah, so, well, and it's a really, it's a real technical idea.
00:46:16.76 --> 00:46:20.92 So, Carl Rogers, who's a psychotherapist, great psychotherapist,
00:46:20.92 --> 00:46:23.72 had very much recommend his books to people, especially if they
00:46:23.72 --> 00:46:26.04 want to learn to listen because he was really good at teaching
00:46:26.04 --> 00:46:27.84 people how to listen.
00:46:27.84 --> 00:46:31.68 He had this idea that what he would manifest towards his clients
00:46:31.68 --> 00:46:35.04 in therapy was unconditional positive regard.
00:46:35.04 --> 00:46:38.32 And I've always had trouble with that because, well, because you
00:46:38.32 --> 00:46:41.88 don't treat your children, for example, with unconditional
00:46:41.88 --> 00:46:42.72 positive regard.
00:46:42.72 --> 00:46:44.68 You mean, there's no matter what someone says, you're saying,
00:46:44.68 --> 00:46:45.48 yeah, that's a good idea.
00:46:45.48 --> 00:46:47.64 Yeah, that's why it's tricky.
00:46:47.64 --> 00:46:51.20 Well, what he didn't articulate it, I think, as well as he
00:46:51.20 --> 00:46:55.44 might have, what you want to do is for your child is that you
00:46:55.44 --> 00:46:59.68 want the best for the best in them.
00:46:59.68 --> 00:47:00.64 That's what you want.
00:47:00.64 --> 00:47:03.44 And that's what you want from people that you surround yourself
00:47:03.44 --> 00:47:03.80 with.
00:47:03.80 --> 00:47:06.08 Now, they'll hold you to a high standard if that's the case,
00:47:06.08 --> 00:47:06.28 right?
00:47:06.28 --> 00:47:10.24 Because whenever you degenerate in any of the multiple ways
00:47:10.24 --> 00:47:12.48 that you're likely to degenerate, they're going to like,
00:47:12.48 --> 00:47:14.84 whack you on the back of the head and say, you know,
00:47:14.84 --> 00:47:17.92 clue the hell in, you know, you're demeaning yourself,
00:47:17.92 --> 00:47:19.28 you're less than you could be.
00:47:19.28 --> 00:47:22.32 And there's real judgment in it, and it's harsh.
00:47:22.32 --> 00:47:24.68 But with friends, it's the same thing.
00:47:24.68 --> 00:47:26.000 You want friends.
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.32 They're not friends if they're not these people.
00:47:28.32 --> 00:47:31.52 You want friends who, when something good happens to you,
00:47:31.52 --> 00:47:34.000 they're at, that's good for you, right?
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.12 They're happy about that.
00:47:35.12 --> 00:47:37.36 They're not like all better in resentful underground
00:47:37.36 --> 00:47:39.36 and like saying horrible things behind your back
00:47:39.36 --> 00:47:41.76 and telling you how they did something that was better
00:47:41.76 --> 00:47:43.44 and trying to drag you down.
00:47:43.44 --> 00:47:45.12 It's like that's not helpful.
00:47:45.12 --> 00:47:48.24 And then when something bad happens to you and you go to them
00:47:48.24 --> 00:47:50.88 and you say, look, this terrible thing happened to me.
00:47:50.88 --> 00:47:53.44 First of all, they don't try to top it with some like horrible
00:47:53.44 --> 00:47:56.24 thing that happened to them because they don't have the patience
00:47:56.24 --> 00:47:59.36 to listen and second, they're not secretly gloating
00:47:59.36 --> 00:48:02.56 about the fact that catastrophe finally be failure.
00:48:02.56 --> 00:48:04.16 It's like they're actually hurt by it.
00:48:04.16 --> 00:48:06.40 And that chapter is an injunction.
00:48:06.40 --> 00:48:08.80 It's like take a look at the people that are around you.
00:48:08.80 --> 00:48:13.52 And if they're not on this side of what's good for you,
00:48:13.52 --> 00:48:18.64 then walk away because, well, first of all, that's best for them too.
00:48:18.64 --> 00:48:21.20 If you put up with that, all you're doing is enabling it.
00:48:21.20 --> 00:48:24.32 It's like, well, it's okay that you mistreat me in a way
00:48:24.32 --> 00:48:26.000 that's harmful to me and everyone else.
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.56 It's like, actually, no, that is not okay.
00:48:28.56 --> 00:48:31.36 It's not the least bit okay.
00:48:31.36 --> 00:48:33.12 It doesn't mean you shouldn't try to help someone
00:48:33.12 --> 00:48:34.08 when they're down.
00:48:34.08 --> 00:48:35.92 That's a whole different issue.
00:48:35.92 --> 00:48:37.04 What if it's your family?
00:48:37.04 --> 00:48:39.60 So you know, you say, like, walk away, right?
00:48:39.60 --> 00:48:40.48 Yeah.
00:48:40.48 --> 00:48:42.40 Do you still walk away from your family?
00:48:42.40 --> 00:48:44.48 Or do you do if it's necessary?
00:48:44.48 --> 00:48:45.36 Yeah.
00:48:45.36 --> 00:48:47.60 There's lots of different ways of walking away.
00:48:47.60 --> 00:48:47.92 Oh, yeah.
00:48:47.92 --> 00:48:48.96 They'll create boundaries.
00:48:48.96 --> 00:48:50.32 Well, there's that for sure.
00:48:50.32 --> 00:48:51.20 There's that.
00:48:51.20 --> 00:48:54.56 I mean, you sometimes someone's on an
00:48:54.56 --> 00:48:56.32 incorrigible path.
00:48:56.32 --> 00:48:58.64 Like, there's just nothing you can do.
00:48:58.64 --> 00:49:00.96 You know, maybe they're aiming down.
00:49:00.96 --> 00:49:02.56 They're aiming down hard.
00:49:02.56 --> 00:49:05.04 And they're better and everything they do is to produce misery,
00:49:05.04 --> 00:49:06.32 virtually everything.
00:49:06.32 --> 00:49:08.72 And you have to detach yourself from that.
00:49:08.72 --> 00:49:12.08 It's like I always think about it from the perspective of a lifeguard.
00:49:12.08 --> 00:49:14.32 So if you're training to be a lifeguard,
00:49:14.32 --> 00:49:16.16 one of the things that you're trained to do
00:49:16.16 --> 00:49:20.08 is to approach someone who's drowning and panicking.
00:49:20.08 --> 00:49:22.72 And the way you approach them is you put your foot out
00:49:22.72 --> 00:49:26.16 between you and them and you push forward with your hands
00:49:26.16 --> 00:49:27.28 with your foot out.
00:49:27.28 --> 00:49:29.44 And you basically tell them if they're flailing about,
00:49:29.44 --> 00:49:31.04 you say, look, I'm here to help.
00:49:31.04 --> 00:49:32.56 But you have to calm down.
00:49:32.56 --> 00:49:34.96 And then if they cling to you, like in panic,
00:49:34.96 --> 00:49:36.08 you push them away.
00:49:36.08 --> 00:49:38.64 You think, well, that's pretty damn cruel because what if they drown?
00:49:38.64 --> 00:49:41.60 It's like, yeah, what if you both drown?
00:49:41.60 --> 00:49:42.96 That's like not helpful.
00:49:42.96 --> 00:49:44.64 You're there to rescue them.
00:49:44.64 --> 00:49:45.60 They take you down.
00:49:45.60 --> 00:49:46.48 You're both dead.
00:49:46.48 --> 00:49:48.24 It's like fail, right?
00:49:48.24 --> 00:49:50.88 So you say, look, good panicking.
00:49:50.88 --> 00:49:53.60 I'll help you out. But I'm not drowning along with you.
00:49:53.60 --> 00:49:56.24 It's like, well, it's the same with someone in your family.
00:49:56.24 --> 00:50:00.56 It's like, if they're on a downward path and you've done your best,
00:50:00.56 --> 00:50:04.56 you know, you've made your efforts, you've and they're not paying attention.
00:50:04.56 --> 00:50:05.44 They're not changing.
00:50:05.44 --> 00:50:07.04 They say, yeah, well, I'll quit doing this.
00:50:07.04 --> 00:50:07.92 Yeah, I'll quit doing this.
00:50:07.92 --> 00:50:10.32 They tell you the same story over and over and over.
00:50:10.32 --> 00:50:11.68 It's a downhill path.
00:50:11.68 --> 00:50:12.72 You don't trust it.
00:50:12.72 --> 00:50:17.12 At some point, first of all, you stop offering your words.
00:50:17.12 --> 00:50:23.28 That's do not cast pearls before swine, a very, very harsh statement, right?
00:50:23.28 --> 00:50:30.24 But what it means is, if someone, if you're offering words of wisdom to someone,
00:50:30.24 --> 00:50:34.56 in the genuine attempt help and they treat that with contempt,
00:50:34.56 --> 00:50:42.16 then shut up because you're demeaning your words by throwing them away.
00:50:42.16 --> 00:50:44.80 You think, well, how do you help someone who's aiming down?
00:50:44.80 --> 00:50:47.92 Well, sometimes you help them by walking away and saying, look,
00:50:47.92 --> 00:50:51.36 you're aiming down so hard that I am, despite the fact,
00:50:51.36 --> 00:50:54.24 you're my brother, man, it's like, you know, this is killing me.
00:50:54.80 --> 00:50:56.24 You're aiming down so hard.
00:50:56.24 --> 00:50:58.16 I'm not coming along with you.
00:50:58.16 --> 00:51:01.28 And the reason I'm not is to tell you and no uncertain terms
00:51:01.28 --> 00:51:06.72 that what you're doing is so terrible that I will even violate our kinship to oppose it.
00:51:06.72 --> 00:51:10.72 And maybe it'll take them 10 years to wake up to that, you know?
00:51:10.72 --> 00:51:17.60 And that can be the case because, you know, people often have to be hit so many times before they'll
00:51:17.60 --> 00:51:23.92 learn. You see that especially if someone's addicted or otherwise pursuing a pathway that's
00:51:23.92 --> 00:51:27.92 like seriously downhill. So, yeah.
00:51:27.92 --> 00:51:31.84 You cover that pretty well in that chapter where you're saying,
00:51:31.84 --> 00:51:34.24 there's a certain point where you just got to say, you know, we're done.
00:51:34.24 --> 00:51:39.36 Yeah, we're done. Well, it's like, why should I think that you're actually trying to change?
00:51:39.36 --> 00:51:44.64 Maybe you're just telling me, is you're, you tell me the story that you use to justify your own
00:51:44.64 --> 00:51:49.60 idiocy to yourself. And then you tell it to me and you demand that because I'm compassionate,
00:51:49.60 --> 00:51:54.80 I accept it and therefore validate your excuse. It's like, well, that like, it's really hard not
00:51:54.80 --> 00:51:58.40 to get tangled up in that, right? Because if someone who's really in rough shape is telling you
00:51:58.40 --> 00:52:03.04 about why they're suffering, first of all, they're probably about half right in their story.
00:52:03.04 --> 00:52:09.20 But some of its justification and excuse and blaming and all of that failure to take responsibility.
00:52:09.20 --> 00:52:12.88 It's really hard to stand up and say, no, I don't buy that. No, I don't buy that. No,
00:52:12.88 --> 00:52:18.16 you're wrong about that. You have to be a brutal bastard in order to do that. But hey,
00:52:18.16 --> 00:52:25.20 sometimes like surgery is brutal, right? It's brutal, but you're a lot of
00:52:25.20 --> 00:52:30.56 cut you open and we're going to rip out part of your body, right? Right, right? Exactly.
00:52:30.56 --> 00:52:37.44 Right, precisely. And so, so this chapter about, you know, only making friends with people who
00:52:37.44 --> 00:52:44.24 want the best for you, that's a brutal chapter. But it's right, unfortunately.
00:52:45.84 --> 00:52:50.80 Going to your book a little bit, I'm going to pick up, going back to that first
00:52:51.84 --> 00:52:58.72 thought. Standing up means voluntarily accepting the burden of being. Your nervous system
00:52:58.72 --> 00:53:03.92 response and an entirely different manner when you face the demands of life voluntarily.
00:53:03.92 --> 00:53:09.44 You respond to a challenge instead of bracing for a catastrophe. You see the gold, the dragon
00:53:09.44 --> 00:53:15.52 hordes instead of shrinking in terror from the all-to-real fact of the dragon. You step forward
00:53:15.52 --> 00:53:21.28 to take your place in the dominance hierarchy and occupy your territory,
00:53:21.28 --> 00:53:27.68 manifesting your willingness to defend, expand and transform it. To stand up straight with your
00:53:27.68 --> 00:53:35.36 shoulders back as to accept the terrible responsibility of life with eyes wide open. The reason I
00:53:35.36 --> 00:53:41.92 pulled that one out in particular is the feeling that you have as a soldier or as a military person.
00:53:42.56 --> 00:53:46.88 A feeling that you have going on an offensive operation? Where let's say you're a bad guy and
00:53:46.88 --> 00:53:51.84 I'm going to come and get you. First of all, you don't know. And I'm sneaking up on you and I have
00:53:51.84 --> 00:53:58.08 all this power, right? I feel good about it. I'm going to get you. The opposite of that is when I'm
00:53:58.08 --> 00:54:02.000 doing a convoy or I'm going on a patrol. We're now the bad guys are out there. They're waiting
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.96 to attack me and that is a defensive posture and you're attitude about that type of thing
00:54:06.96 --> 00:54:14.24 is bad. Now we were train our guys that we made a specific point with my guys I would say,
00:54:14.24 --> 00:54:20.000 look, when you're on patrol, we're on offense. We are scanning. We are looking to get the
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.000 to get us to be standing up straight and to get the mentality of we want to do this and we're moving
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:32.80 towards the target as opposed to we're being chased. That's a big deal. It's absolutely that's a big
00:54:32.80 --> 00:54:39.44 deal. Yeah and that's what would you say? That's an extreme example of what's necessary
00:54:39.44 --> 00:54:43.76 under normal conditions in life. So what one of the things that happens if you're treating someone
00:54:43.76 --> 00:54:50.16 who has a phobias, like agro phobias, they become afraid of virtually everything. Maybe they're
00:54:50.16 --> 00:54:55.28 afraid of an elevator. It's one of many fears and so you think well. They're afraid of an
00:54:55.28 --> 00:54:58.88 elevator because they've actually gone in elevators and had panic attacks. So it's weird because
00:54:58.88 --> 00:55:02.80 what you do to cure them is to get them to go in elevators and you think, well wait a second,
00:55:02.80 --> 00:55:08.08 that's actually what caused the problem. So how can getting them to do that again make it better?
00:55:08.08 --> 00:55:11.76 And that answer is because they've gone in elevators their whole life, right? And yet they still
00:55:11.76 --> 00:55:17.20 become terrified. So how can getting them to go in an elevator cure them? For a long time people thought,
00:55:17.20 --> 00:55:22.000 well you get them to relax while they were in the elevator and the pairing of the relaxation
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.56 with being in the elevator taught them to not be afraid. That was the first theory but then people
00:55:26.56 --> 00:55:30.08 learned that no you could just get them to go in the elevator without having them relax and it
00:55:30.08 --> 00:55:34.08 also worked. And eventually psychologists sorted this out and what they figured out was that
00:55:35.52 --> 00:55:41.04 voluntarily encountering something you're afraid of is not the same thing as running from it.
00:55:41.04 --> 00:55:45.52 Like it's seriously not the same thing. So you say to the person, okay you're afraid of the
00:55:45.52 --> 00:55:51.52 elevator, let's can you go look at an elevator? They usually say yes and maybe they're so terrified
00:55:51.52 --> 00:55:54.88 because they're so far gone in their illness that they can't say well how about we look at a bunch
00:55:54.88 --> 00:55:59.28 of pictures of elevators and it's like virtually everyone can do that. So let's look at pictures of
00:55:59.28 --> 00:56:03.92 elevators till your board. That actually doesn't take very long because it's actually quite boring.
00:56:03.92 --> 00:56:08.08 So then the next thing would be, well let's go you have to have the person trust you and so
00:56:08.08 --> 00:56:13.28 the rule is look we're going to do some things that are going to push you like competition.
00:56:13.28 --> 00:56:17.04 Right. But you can stop whenever you want and we're not going to push you any farther than
00:56:17.04 --> 00:56:21.52 is good for you and I'll stop anytime you want. I often practice with my clients like I
00:56:21.52 --> 00:56:26.32 taught one client a while back to not be afraid of needles and he was afraid of needles and I'll
00:56:26.32 --> 00:56:33.52 tell you what that meant. He had dental surgery with no anesthesia. Right. Okay so that gives you
00:56:33.52 --> 00:56:37.44 some level of what it's like to be afraid. It's like all do the dental surgery but you're not
00:56:37.44 --> 00:56:44.88 putting that needle in there. It's really? It's like I'm no needles. So I taught him how to not be afraid
00:56:44.88 --> 00:56:50.24 of needles. You know and it didn't take very long but the first thing I did is said I told him I was
00:56:50.24 --> 00:56:54.96 going to bring a needle into the office and that was all I told him the first week is next week
00:56:54.96 --> 00:56:59.12 I'm going to bring a needle in here and I'm going to keep it sheathed and it's going to be sitting
00:56:59.12 --> 00:57:03.28 on a shelf and that's where I'm going to put it and when you come in here you can look at it
00:57:03.28 --> 00:57:08.32 and if you want me to put it away then I'll put it away. It's under your control and then so he was
00:57:08.32 --> 00:57:11.92 okay without. So he came in and there's the needle said you want to look at it and said no it's
00:57:11.92 --> 00:57:16.000 but canyots like I'll look at it. So he looked at it and then it said look like I'm going to pick up the
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.04 needle and now what you're going to do is you're going to tell me to put it down and I'm going to put it
00:57:21.04 --> 00:57:26.64 down so I picked it up and he got nervous like right away and he said well you put that down
00:57:26.64 --> 00:57:33.20 I put it down right away so we do that 10 times so that the bottom part of your nervous system
00:57:33.20 --> 00:57:38.64 actually knows that that's what's going to happen. Said now and then the next thing we'll do is
00:57:38.64 --> 00:57:43.52 we're going to practice you saying you've had enough and leaving the office so I pick up the
00:57:43.52 --> 00:57:48.56 needle and he'd say okay so now you say you've had enough I'm leaving and so he said that and then
00:57:48.56 --> 00:57:52.80 I'd let him leave we did that like 10 times so that he knew that he could just say he'd have
00:57:52.80 --> 00:57:57.12 enough and leave so that mean he didn't have to be a prey animal right so we're getting them out of
00:57:57.12 --> 00:58:03.92 that mode and it didn't take very long until well then I could bring the needle close to him and
00:58:03.92 --> 00:58:07.76 I say make sure you watch it you can't pretend it's not there right I'll bring it close to him
00:58:07.76 --> 00:58:13.28 and touch him with the sheath needle so we did that a bunch and then finally I unsheathed it and I
00:58:13.28 --> 00:58:18.16 bring it close and he tolerate that or stopped me and then I'd touch him with that and then
00:58:18.16 --> 00:58:24.24 the last part of it was that I put it under a piece of paper so he couldn't see it and then I'd
00:58:24.24 --> 00:58:28.72 bring it close to him right because that was that was the unknown right you don't know what the hell
00:58:28.72 --> 00:58:33.04 it's going on underneath the piece of paper but he got to the point where he could go and have a needle
00:58:33.04 --> 00:58:38.48 I took on about it was very brave of him to do this because well what had happened he got what had
00:58:38.48 --> 00:58:42.80 happened to him is he had a very bad experience with the childhood dentist I was held down the same
00:58:42.80 --> 00:58:47.28 one where the hell oh yeah held him six people held him down to give him a needle it's like
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.68 what was that so good it had some long-term consequences but see what happened so when you when you do
00:58:53.68 --> 00:59:00.80 that with people you don't teach them to be less afraid you teach them to be braver that's different
00:59:00.80 --> 00:59:05.04 and so like I had a client once the door is open on the elevator and she looked and she said that's
00:59:05.04 --> 00:59:09.92 death like that's a tomb and I thought wow that's an amazing response and her idea was she'd go in
00:59:09.92 --> 00:59:14.24 there her hardweight would accelerate she'd have a hard attack and she'd die so as far as she was
00:59:14.24 --> 00:59:19.44 concerned walking in there was death right okay so for me it was an elevator but for her it was death
00:59:19.44 --> 00:59:24.24 it's like okay well what do you do about your fear of death well we're not getting rid of that it's like
00:59:26.24 --> 00:59:30.32 you know and you could die in the elevator you actually could probably you won't but people do
00:59:30.32 --> 00:59:35.12 die in elevators and her idea was that well if anyone has ever died in an elevator in the history of
00:59:35.12 --> 00:59:40.56 mankind that's a good reason for me not to be in the elevator it's like fair enough you know and why aren't
00:59:40.56 --> 00:59:44.64 you terrified of out of your skull all the time because while you're wondering around you might have a
00:59:44.64 --> 00:59:50.08 heart attack like that will probably in fact happen to you at some point so why aren't you terrified of
00:59:50.08 --> 00:59:56.08 that at every moment well that's the mystery well so you treat people and and you see without
00:59:56.08 --> 01:00:01.68 client what I eventually did with hers we went and watched an abomining she was terrified of death
01:00:01.68 --> 01:00:12.24 like seriously yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right no kidding but you know so you get you don't get
01:00:12.24 --> 01:00:18.32 less afraid you get braver that's better because there's plenty of things to be afraid of but you can
01:00:18.32 --> 01:00:23.76 get braver so that's something people manage this on their own ever oh yeah yeah people manage it
01:00:23.76 --> 01:00:27.20 on their own they'd manage it on their own all the time like you know let's say you're in a
01:00:27.20 --> 01:00:31.44 ratty horrible job and you're being oppressed by your boss and one day you think I've had enough
01:00:31.44 --> 01:00:35.44 and you go right your resume it's like there you go that's what you're doing it's like you know you're
01:00:35.44 --> 01:00:41.12 you're because you think well I've got the devil I know and and then there's the devil I don't
01:00:41.12 --> 01:00:45.44 know and that's relevant when you're when you're trying to switch careers can I find another job
01:00:45.44 --> 01:00:49.60 well anyone hire me how long will this take to I have to get educated again I've to put my resume
01:00:49.60 --> 01:00:53.76 together that's a real pain because there's holes in it and I don't know how to present myself
01:00:53.76 --> 01:00:58.32 then I have to go to interviews and it's like oh my god that's no you know that's a lot of trouble
01:00:58.32 --> 01:01:04.88 well then you think no I'm I'm gonna start that I'm gonna rewrite my resumes like well then
01:01:04.88 --> 01:01:11.12 up you get right just your moving forward in your life you're not taken being tyrannized by your
01:01:11.12 --> 01:01:16.64 son of a bitch of a boss and you're out to do something about it you know and people can get really
01:01:16.64 --> 01:01:21.60 good at that so one of the things you do is a psychotherapist is just you do assertiveness training
01:01:21.60 --> 01:01:25.92 it's like so people come and they say help help I'm being oppressed in that famous
01:01:25.92 --> 01:01:31.36 Monty Python in the famous Monty Python manner and you say okay look well first of all you're
01:01:31.36 --> 01:01:36.72 probably whining a lot so let's figure that out so you quit whining and then let's figure out how you
01:01:36.72 --> 01:01:42.000 actually are oppressed and what might be done about it and then let's figure out a strategy and then
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.36 let's help you practice the strategy until you get good at it and and let's also map out the
01:01:47.36 --> 01:01:53.44 consequences of not fixing it because people think well how can I stand up to my boss it's like that's
01:01:53.44 --> 01:01:58.88 terrible I might risk my jobs like yeah fair enough no wonder you're afraid of that maybe you should just
01:01:58.88 --> 01:02:04.32 shut up let's see what your life would be like in 10 years if you just shut up it's like you know how
01:02:04.32 --> 01:02:08.96 about it is now it's like it's gonna be way worse than that because you're gonna shrink and shrink
01:02:08.96 --> 01:02:13.04 and shrink and your boss is gonna become more and more tyrannical and you're gonna hate every
01:02:13.04 --> 01:02:18.88 minute of your life and it's like you want that or do you want to confront your boss or change jobs
01:02:18.88 --> 01:02:24.16 it's like oh I see it's like hell here it's hell here I get it I get to pick which of those I'm
01:02:24.16 --> 01:02:31.36 going to walk down and that's a relief to people most of the time it's so funny because people often think they have
01:02:32.48 --> 01:02:37.20 their their paralyzed because they think that there's a good option right yeah but what are the
01:02:37.20 --> 01:02:42.64 things you do is a psychotherapist to say oh no you no no you're screwed no matter which way you turn it's
01:02:42.64 --> 01:02:47.44 it's like a crocodile here and it's a wolf there and and behind you there's a hyena it's like
01:02:47.44 --> 01:02:56.16 there's no lambs you're not in lament territory it's all predators well pick your battle pick your
01:02:56.16 --> 01:03:01.76 battle and then all of a sudden you're in battle and then it doesn't matter that it's a hyena because
01:03:01.76 --> 01:03:09.20 you're warrior so fine bring it on this is a common to another point that I picked up from the book
01:03:09.20 --> 01:03:13.28 that I have a leadership management consultant company so I work with companies all the time and
01:03:13.28 --> 01:03:18.48 one of the topics has come up a bunch in the past couple of years is you know when you're dealing with
01:03:18.48 --> 01:03:23.60 someone you're dealing with an employee and you got firearm and how this is a big hard conversation
01:03:23.60 --> 01:03:29.68 and et cetera except or no one wants to have those and I always say look if you have the hard
01:03:29.68 --> 01:03:34.40 conversation earlier it's not so hard because all I have to tell you say Jordan you know you were
01:03:34.40 --> 01:03:39.12 late today and we're not supposed to be late and you all sorry and the problems sort of self-out
01:03:39.12 --> 01:03:44.96 or it doesn't and then I got escalated yeah but what you talk about in the book is if there's a
01:03:44.96 --> 01:03:50.48 problem go attack it you can go get that problem solved don't go after that drag you know the dragons in
01:03:50.48 --> 01:03:55.76 there go get it well your observation is dead on it's like and this is the problem with being too
01:03:55.76 --> 01:04:00.96 nice like I don't what regard nice is a virtue or if it's a virtue it's a very low order virtue
01:04:00.96 --> 01:04:07.60 because what nice usually means but nice usually means is I don't want to cause conflict now even
01:04:07.60 --> 01:04:12.16 though the consequences of the conflict might multiply into the future so let's say you have an
01:04:12.16 --> 01:04:16.72 employee that's chronically late right and but you I don't want to I don't really want to disturb
01:04:16.72 --> 01:04:20.000 them I don't want to cause any trouble it's like while you're angry about it because they're late
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.68 and they're not supposed to be so you're getting all bitter and resentful plus you're not doing
01:04:23.68 --> 01:04:28.32 the many favors you know because you're also telling them that you can be taken advantage of
01:04:28.32 --> 01:04:33.04 and that they're lack of discipline is okay and then you know so then you're going to dislike the
01:04:33.04 --> 01:04:38.40 employee and you're going to amplify their other errors in your because of your distaste and then
01:04:38.40 --> 01:04:41.84 and if they are someone who's taking advantage of you then they're going to take advantage of you
01:04:41.84 --> 01:04:45.36 a little more and then a little more and a little more and a little more and then you're going to have
01:04:45.36 --> 01:04:50.48 to have a really difficult conversation or put up with it and that might sink your business especially
01:04:50.48 --> 01:04:57.12 if you're a small business owner so by not confronting the dragon when it's like two inches high
01:04:57.12 --> 01:05:02.24 and can only you know it's like it can bell-chowed something like a bit lighter you wait till
01:05:02.24 --> 01:05:06.64 the thing can inflame the whole room and then you say oh my god like isn't this hellish it's like well
01:05:07.44 --> 01:05:13.60 you knew that there was something to say you knew it you knew it a thousand times and now
01:05:14.32 --> 01:05:18.32 you can't just say the one thing you have to say the thousand things or maybe you have to say the
01:05:18.32 --> 01:05:24.08 ten thousand things and it's just destructive in every way so yeah that's not good
01:05:24.08 --> 01:05:31.84 now here's where I need help with this so what I think people might get the ideas okay if
01:05:31.84 --> 01:05:38.40 I'm in a relationship with my wife and she gives serves me dry chicken again right which is
01:05:38.40 --> 01:05:43.28 a common theme in my house and actually thanks to the internet it's actually changed now
01:05:43.28 --> 01:05:47.36 because she's gotten thousands of people that haven't now sent her how to keep the chicken more
01:05:47.36 --> 01:05:52.56 so she does a great job but for for you know we're talking about two decades of my life we're
01:05:52.56 --> 01:05:58.24 talking about dry chicken this is a problem so and you know what I did I didn't say anything
01:05:58.24 --> 01:06:04.16 because I just would drink more water yeah more water at dinner yeah I fear that sometimes people
01:06:04.16 --> 01:06:06.72 say well you know what I'm gonna do so I'm just gonna run around it I'm gonna tell the truth to
01:06:06.72 --> 01:06:12.80 everyone all the time on these little things that don't matter now my my my actual best example
01:06:12.80 --> 01:06:17.76 that I've ever heard of this we we had a guy in the podcast named Charlie Plum he was a pilot in
01:06:17.76 --> 01:06:25.60 Vietnam he was shot down in and on his last mission of his deployment he was shot down he was captured
01:06:25.60 --> 01:06:32.88 using the honeyhilton for six years this is the deal that they had amongst their roommates so they
01:06:32.88 --> 01:06:36.64 had roommates and it's run smaller than we're in right now and there'd be four of them in there
01:06:36.64 --> 01:06:40.56 three of them and they're two from there depending on what's going on if you did something
01:06:40.56 --> 01:06:45.92 then normally if Jordan does something that annoys me we gotta live together if you do something
01:06:45.92 --> 01:06:52.72 that annoys me it's my fault it's my fault for allowing you clip clip click your nails together
01:06:52.72 --> 01:06:56.88 or you pick your nose a lot or you itch your head whatever it is that you do that bothers me
01:06:56.88 --> 01:07:03.04 it's my problem and I have to absorb it because otherwise what we have is we have like rats and
01:07:03.04 --> 01:07:09.12 a cage that are gonna knowledge other apart and I thought about that while I was reading the
01:07:09.12 --> 01:07:14.000 part of the book that was saying and you actually also later in the book talk about hey you know
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.08 you're gonna get fight over this little stupid thing or you're gonna absorb and I talk about that
01:07:18.08 --> 01:07:24.24 a lot as a leader yeah as a as a person in a relationship hey there's problems from your boss
01:07:24.96 --> 01:07:29.04 you absorb them and you don't pass them down to your people you know you you want to stay
01:07:29.04 --> 01:07:32.80 work or stay late and do a much crazy stuff that we don't think we should be doing cool my
01:07:32.80 --> 01:07:37.60 guys are gonna go home I'm gonna absorb that I'll get it done myself I'm not gonna absorb these problems
01:07:37.60 --> 01:07:42.56 now are there some tertiary effects of course or secondary effects that know my boss thinks
01:07:42.56 --> 01:07:47.76 you can get away with that and all those things but I just think there's we have to be careful
01:07:47.76 --> 01:07:53.12 that we're not just throwing a lot of spears of truth in people's hands or whatever is
01:07:53.12 --> 01:07:57.60 a bunch of black truths they're the opposite of white lies right so black truths are truth
01:07:57.60 --> 01:08:04.24 you used to hurt other people with right so technically in the moment the statement is factual
01:08:04.24 --> 01:08:09.28 but the context be lies right whereas a white lie it's like well it's a little lie but you're
01:08:09.28 --> 01:08:14.32 trying to support a larger truth not that white white lies aren't optimal you know it's better
01:08:14.32 --> 01:08:19.36 not to lie but sometimes the best you can manage is a white lie and then maybe that's better
01:08:19.36 --> 01:08:25.12 pretty good well okay so then in those sorts of situations you think well first of all I have
01:08:25.12 --> 01:08:31.12 some rules of thumb if someone does something at work that annoys you it's like right it off man
01:08:31.12 --> 01:08:35.68 it's like that's once it's like what does that mean you're having a bad day or I'm having
01:08:35.68 --> 01:08:42.64 a bad day it's like doesn't mean anything do it twice think it's okay that's right that off
01:08:42.64 --> 01:08:48.000 right that off it's that's the same issue it could still just be circumstance in situation
01:08:49.04 --> 01:08:54.56 three times okay now there might be grounds for a conversation you go and say well you know
01:08:54.56 --> 01:09:00.72 you put your feet up on my desk like but they ago and that was okay but then you did it again
01:09:00.72 --> 01:09:07.36 and then like you did it again and I'm thinking it actually happened three times right so there's
01:09:07.36 --> 01:09:12.32 no denying it and perhaps that's not optimal and then you go for the smallest possible
01:09:12.32 --> 01:09:18.80 victory that's the next thing is like I'm not telling you that you're what would you say
01:09:18.80 --> 01:09:24.24 that you lack respect or that there's something wrong with you what I'm asking is that if you come
01:09:24.24 --> 01:09:32.48 in my office it would be better for both of us if your feet stayed on the floor that okay
01:09:33.04 --> 01:09:37.84 you know and and that's a small thing you're not going after the person's character right you're
01:09:37.84 --> 01:09:42.08 going after the tiny victory so you say to your wife look like I'm thrilled to death that you're
01:09:42.08 --> 01:09:47.36 cooking me dinner really I'm serious because and it could be a hell of lot worse than it is you know
01:09:47.36 --> 01:09:52.48 and and maybe I could be more helpful around the kitchen that's certainly a possibility
01:09:53.20 --> 01:09:58.48 but I have to go out this thing with regards to chicken and maybe it's me you know but could we
01:09:58.48 --> 01:10:04.16 try for like a month to cook it differently and then we'll revisit it and if I happen to be wrong
01:10:04.16 --> 01:10:08.96 like I'll shut the hell up and she might think okay well he is kind of useless around the
01:10:08.96 --> 01:10:15.44 kitchen and sort of bitchy about the chicken and all of that but maybe I trust him enough to admit
01:10:15.44 --> 01:10:20.000 that I made a small mistake and rectify it and we could go along and not have the damn chicken thing
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.48 hanging over our heads till we're 80 you know you just in your second example there you I tell
01:10:26.48 --> 01:10:30.08 people it's all the time so you you're coming into my office and you're putting your feet in the
01:10:30.08 --> 01:10:36.88 desk what I'll generally do is make it my fault I generally say hey Jordan I hate to be like a
01:10:36.88 --> 01:10:42.24 nitpicker yeah but I'm really freaked out about germs it's really stupid but yeah and when you
01:10:42.24 --> 01:10:46.16 come and put your feet on my desk it freaks me out yeah you just do me a favor and not put your
01:10:46.16 --> 01:10:50.40 feet on your knees I was thinking of the same thing with you know with the chicken it's like hey
01:10:50.40 --> 01:10:55.60 you know what I have a super sensitive palate refined and I just do the rough minds just to
01:10:55.60 --> 01:11:01.92 refine for your story but and I just yeah could we maybe figure out another way to cook that
01:11:01.92 --> 01:11:09.12 or okay we try you know but I'll take the blame for for the situation rather than your
01:11:09.12 --> 01:11:12.96 your disrespect for don't put your feet on my desk this is you know well you don't want to
01:11:12.96 --> 01:11:19.76 adopt more of a position of moral superiority than is absolutely necessary one of the things I
01:11:19.76 --> 01:11:24.24 recommend I don't remember if I wrote it into all rules for life I think I did about how to
01:11:24.24 --> 01:11:29.04 let's say you're in an intractable argument with your wife about who's the most reprehensible
01:11:29.04 --> 01:11:35.20 person right which is where arguments sort of end when they go to hell I think now you're in
01:11:35.20 --> 01:11:40.48 one of those arguments and you risk bringing up the past which is a very very bad idea right
01:11:40.48 --> 01:11:45.12 maybe you're saying something like you've always been this way you're this way down you'll never
01:11:45.12 --> 01:11:49.28 change and none of it's good it's like oh man that's a fight because where where are you going to
01:11:49.28 --> 01:11:53.44 go from there so one of the things I recommend and this actually works is when you're in one of
01:11:53.44 --> 01:11:57.92 these battles and you can't bloody well get out of it you separate each go to your room and you
01:11:57.92 --> 01:12:02.88 sit and think okay that person is really wrong and I like to give them a good stomping and
01:12:02.88 --> 01:12:06.80 but then you think no I got to live with them so that's probably not a good idea right because I
01:12:06.80 --> 01:12:10.08 don't want to live with someone who's like stomped and angry about it because they're going to
01:12:10.08 --> 01:12:15.12 take their revenge like if they have any spirit at all so you cannot win an argument with your wife
01:12:15.12 --> 01:12:21.68 that's just wrong you can't you can make peace you can come up with a solution but if you win
01:12:21.68 --> 01:12:28.16 she loses and then she's the loser and like unless you want to have a loser around that's not
01:12:28.16 --> 01:12:34.24 a very good strategy anyway so you go to your room and you think okay fundamentally flawed as my
01:12:34.24 --> 01:12:39.52 wife is particularly in this particular circumstance there's probably something stupid
01:12:39.52 --> 01:12:45.20 idea in the relatively recent past that increased the probability that we're in this little
01:12:45.20 --> 01:12:50.56 hellish place and you think oh what was it and you think oh god I really don't want to know
01:12:50.56 --> 01:12:56.16 it's like I really don't want to know this and so you think no I'm going to figure out where I'm one
01:12:56.16 --> 01:13:02.24 percent at fault she's 99% wrong but I'm I'm 1% at fault so you sit there and you think okay what
01:13:02.24 --> 01:13:08.40 was it and you let your imagination sort of wander over your past stupidities and you think oh
01:13:08.96 --> 01:13:13.76 there is something I did that was like kind of underhanded and devious and crooked and pathetic and
01:13:13.76 --> 01:13:19.52 weasely and then you go and you tell her and she does the same thing you know and she's just
01:13:19.52 --> 01:13:24.000 irritated about it as you are and then you think okay and you say look I'm sorry about that and
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.20 I know this increased the probability that we're in this like bitchy horrible place and she does the
01:13:29.20 --> 01:13:33.52 same thing and then you think oh yeah well we're both pathetic losers and we can quit plan
01:13:33.52 --> 01:13:37.36 like dominance hierarchy and then maybe you can have a conversation about how to make it better
01:13:37.36 --> 01:13:41.52 and that conversation should be bounded too it's like the chicken thing is a really good
01:13:42.24 --> 01:13:48.48 my my father-in-law who I really like used to come my wife told me this story he used to come
01:13:48.48 --> 01:13:54.56 home for lunch eh and his wife would feed him lunch and she always used little plates and it was
01:13:54.56 --> 01:14:00.64 like they'd been married for 30 years and one day he had this explosion at the table about the fact
01:14:00.64 --> 01:14:06.72 that he'd had to eat off these damn little plates for 30 years and you know it was much more of a
01:14:07.76 --> 01:14:12.64 large explosion than it had to be but it's these little things actually matter they actually
01:14:12.64 --> 01:14:17.36 matter they have to straighten them out because your life especially with your wife is composed of
01:14:17.36 --> 01:14:23.44 about 50 little things that you do every day and because you do them every day they're not little
01:14:24.32 --> 01:14:27.44 you can just do the arithmetic you know it's like maybe you don't like
01:14:27.44 --> 01:14:32.88 where your wife greets you when you come home it's like okay is that relevant is that important well
01:14:33.28 --> 01:14:37.12 let's say it takes 10 minutes because you're thinking about it and you're coming home and then there's
01:14:37.12 --> 01:14:41.68 the little aftermath of it's 10 minutes so it's like an hour a week it's four hours a month it's 50
01:14:41.68 --> 01:14:47.04 hours a year that's one work week it's 2% of your life it's like 2% of your life right so that's
01:14:47.04 --> 01:14:53.60 the math it's like if you got 50 of those things right your whole life would be right think is it
01:14:53.60 --> 01:14:58.64 worth fighting about just like yeah it's worth it because it's 2% of your life or which one percent
01:14:58.64 --> 01:15:04.000 even whatever and then you think okay well how should people greet themselves when they first
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.36 come home it's like well maybe it's not quite like your dog greets you because your dog is like
01:15:09.36 --> 01:15:15.04 reprehensively happy to see that's just too much right little candle do that but maybe you want
01:15:15.04 --> 01:15:21.04 the person to not be watching TV for the second you enter the house maybe they should just stop
01:15:21.04 --> 01:15:25.36 watching TV and come and say you know hello how was your day and give you a hug that would be a
01:15:25.36 --> 01:15:30.16 good thing and then maybe you do the same thing to them and you practice that for like two months
01:15:30.16 --> 01:15:34.08 because you're both stupid and it's really hard for you to learn anything and then you've got that
01:15:34.08 --> 01:15:39.28 down and the dinner times are like that too like a lot and lots of households meal times are really
01:15:39.28 --> 01:15:45.92 fractured which is a bad thing or they're bitter it's like I'm here's your goddamn food it's like
01:15:45.92 --> 01:15:50.96 yeah I'll eat it but I can't stand it and you can't cook it's like okay that's four and a half hours
01:15:50.96 --> 01:15:56.80 a day right for your whole life you think you're gonna like someone like that not a bit man you know
01:15:56.80 --> 01:16:01.84 I'd do like them so you fix that you actually did tell that whole thing in the book so that's
01:16:01.84 --> 01:16:06.000 it's good is in there and actually the phrasing that you used when you say if you win an argument
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.20 you said something along the lines of you win you win that argument they're the loser yeah
01:16:11.20 --> 01:16:16.48 now you win that argument a hundred times now in a marriage you win ten thousand times and you
01:16:16.48 --> 01:16:23.44 are now married to a loser and that loser that loser is not going to be someone who makes any effort
01:16:23.44 --> 01:16:30.56 whatsoever ever to be attractive to you or anyone else then you'll think oh look look look look
01:16:30.56 --> 01:16:38.48 who I ended up with it's like no look at how you produced it's like good work there it's guy and
01:16:38.48 --> 01:16:43.04 that's the so so what you're talking about with this argument thing and you look go but you
01:16:43.04 --> 01:16:47.68 separate you go in your room you say okay what did I do wrong yeah right I do wrong that's annoying
01:16:47.68 --> 01:16:53.20 what did I do wrong and and interestingly myself and my my my buddy life babbling we wrote a book
01:16:53.20 --> 01:16:58.64 called Extreme ownership and I mean whole premises you take responsibility for when things go wrong
01:16:58.64 --> 01:17:04.72 you say yeah this was my fault so I'll go to clients and I'll be meeting with them and I'll say
01:17:04.72 --> 01:17:07.76 you look when you something goes wrong with your team you're with me you guys made a mistake you fail
01:17:07.76 --> 01:17:11.12 up whatever you're trying to accomplish you know you gotta take ownership of you stand up and you
01:17:11.12 --> 01:17:17.12 say hey look this was my fault and this is what you know we're gonna do and then the people will
01:17:17.12 --> 01:17:22.64 say well you know what if I did that my team is so bad yeah that if I did that with my team you know
01:17:22.64 --> 01:17:28.24 what they'd say they'd say you're right it is your fault and and it looked at me like well
01:17:28.24 --> 01:17:33.28 the so you're plan jocco sucks yeah because if I say this is my fault my team is gonna look at
01:17:33.28 --> 01:17:39.44 me and say you're right it is your fault and then what do I do and I kind of get a little bit
01:17:40.48 --> 01:17:47.84 maybe a little bit frustrated because I look at them and I say that's the whole point it actually
01:17:47.84 --> 01:17:53.20 is your fault you're not just saying it to get out of the the problem you're not just saying it
01:17:53.20 --> 01:17:57.84 to make excuses for everything that's happening no when you say hey this is my fault that we
01:17:57.84 --> 01:18:02.88 got in this argument and then your and your wife says yeah it is you don't say no no no no no no you
01:18:02.88 --> 01:18:09.12 say I know and you have to mean it is you say I know and this is what I'm gonna do to fix it and
01:18:09.12 --> 01:18:11.92 if you're a leader you say it's my fault and your team says yeah you're right it is your fault you
01:18:11.92 --> 01:18:16.80 say I know that's what I just said and here's what I'm gonna do to fix it so when you take ownership
01:18:16.80 --> 01:18:21.12 of a problem it doesn't necessarily make the problem go away in fact it doesn't do that at all
01:18:21.12 --> 01:18:24.72 once you admit what the problem is and you take ownership of the problem then you have to say
01:18:24.72 --> 01:18:30.24 here's what I'm gonna do to fix it let's say your high school kid and you got a tyrant as a
01:18:30.24 --> 01:18:34.96 teacher it's like well you could it could be the case that you have a tyrant as a teacher and the
01:18:34.96 --> 01:18:38.80 tyrant is particularly on your case and you think well yeah that's an awful thing and this
01:18:38.80 --> 01:18:43.68 person really is a tyrant it's like yeah but you're not very good at dealing with tyrants
01:18:43.68 --> 01:18:48.000 you might think well I shouldn't have to be it's like fair enough man because who wants tyrants
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:55.60 but truth of the matter is is that there is always tyranny and if you don't know how to deal with it
01:18:55.60 --> 01:19:01.28 if you don't know how to thrive in the face of tyranny even then there is something wrong with you
01:19:01.28 --> 01:19:05.20 now doesn't mean that there isn't something wrong with the tyrant it's like that's self-evident
01:19:05.20 --> 01:19:10.88 but it doesn't mean that you aren't who you could be because if you were everything you could be
01:19:10.88 --> 01:19:15.60 you could manage that situation and it might be you'd figure out an exit strategy I mean who the
01:19:15.60 --> 01:19:21.12 hell knows what the solution would be but if you if you're conceiving yourself as helpless
01:19:21.12 --> 01:19:26.32 victim then that's what you are and I'm not saying that there aren't situations that people find
01:19:26.32 --> 01:19:33.04 themselves in where there's very well it's hard to say you know that there's very little you can
01:19:33.04 --> 01:19:37.20 do I mean that woman that we talked about earlier she was in a pretty damn hopeless situation
01:19:37.20 --> 01:19:41.60 and she found something she could do you know and I've read these books Victor Frankles
01:19:41.60 --> 01:19:46.48 man search for meaning and social netizens go like archipelago I mean he saw people in some pretty
01:19:46.48 --> 01:19:53.92 damn dire straits like really you know really beyond comprehension and he noticed even in
01:19:53.92 --> 01:19:58.96 those situations that people still have their choices to make you know and I mean you you
01:19:58.96 --> 01:20:03.36 tread on that ground with extreme hesitancy because you don't say well man if I was thrown in the
01:20:03.36 --> 01:20:07.92 go like I would have been noble it's like no probably not man you would have been a trusty in about
01:20:07.92 --> 01:20:12.32 15 minutes you know that's the most likely outcome so you have to be careful about not
01:20:12.32 --> 01:20:17.92 getting too high on your horse about such things but it isn't obvious when you're out of choices
01:20:17.92 --> 01:20:24.000 most of the time you have more choices you haven't used all the choices you have most of the time
01:20:24.56 --> 01:20:29.92 now I've seen people in situations I couldn't help them get out of so and people die right
01:20:29.92 --> 01:20:34.40 I mean you have a fatal illness you have pancreatic cancer like you're dead in six months your
01:20:34.40 --> 01:20:39.92 choices are limited but maybe under those circumstances you figure out how to put your house in order
01:20:40.48 --> 01:20:46.72 and be what you can to the people who will be left it's something like that from for me and I
01:20:46.72 --> 01:20:51.28 get a lot of and I know you get infinitely more than me but I'll get someone that reports to me
01:20:51.28 --> 01:20:57.28 a problem or a situation that they're in that seems really bad and and what I've found is
01:20:57.28 --> 01:21:04.80 the solution that they're looking for the only solution that they can conceive of is one that is
01:21:04.80 --> 01:21:10.40 going to provide that solution within a two week time frame like that's what we're talking about
01:21:10.40 --> 01:21:16.000 if I'm not this problem is installed in two weeks then you know this is hell and I always kind
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:22.000 of report back and say hey you're here in a job right now that I understand it's bad I understand
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.48 it's your boss's terrible the team is terrible whatever the case is what it or you're in a
01:21:26.48 --> 01:21:32.000 situation or your family is this or whatever so conceive of plan right now and it's not going to take
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.88 two weeks it might take six months it might take a year it might take a year and a half of you
01:21:36.88 --> 01:21:41.20 saving your money and setting your resume and getting the service skills that you need if you can
01:21:41.20 --> 01:21:46.32 if you can extend your time and I'll tell you what when you when you come up with that plan when you
01:21:46.32 --> 01:21:54.000 conceive of that plan immediately you have hope and when you have hope you can continue on through
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.12 the miserable existence that you're in because you know that you've got a plan and you're going to
01:21:57.12 --> 01:22:01.44 get your way out of it absolutely well I had a client recently because I've done a lot of consulting
01:22:01.44 --> 01:22:06.08 as well it's clinical work and often my clients come to me they're high functioning people they
01:22:06.08 --> 01:22:12.08 have decent jobs but you know we make a plan it's like well I'm making 75 thousand dollars a year
01:22:12.08 --> 01:22:16.64 right now the person says so well how much well okay we're going to we're going to prove that like
01:22:16.64 --> 01:22:20.64 why don't we see if we can triple that see if we can triple it it's like what the hell you know
01:22:20.64 --> 01:22:27.04 maybe we can't but maybe we can some people do make triple that could be you okay so what's wrong
01:22:27.04 --> 01:22:32.24 with you well you know you're not educated enough all right so we need to fix that your resume is
01:22:32.24 --> 01:22:37.52 in order you're not sending the damn thing out it's like well then you got to do baselines
01:22:37.52 --> 01:22:41.84 statistics it's like well how many times do you have to send out your resume to to move ahead
01:22:41.84 --> 01:22:46.80 when you're already in a pretty decent job well the answer isn't 10 the answer is like you have
01:22:46.80 --> 01:22:53.68 to send out five a day every day for the next two years and the the rejection rate will be so
01:22:53.68 --> 01:22:59.84 close to a hundred percent that that's what it will feel like right but it's a lottery ticket you
01:22:59.84 --> 01:23:06.40 only have to win once so it doesn't matter if you if you lose 300 times doesn't matter you just need
01:23:06.40 --> 01:23:10.72 one hit so now you got to prepare yourself because it's going to be brutal because you're sending
01:23:10.72 --> 01:23:17.04 out all these you know resumes to jobs you're not quite qualified enough for because you're looking
01:23:17.04 --> 01:23:22.88 to move up brace yourself right it's going to be nothing but failure nothing but failure well
01:23:22.88 --> 01:23:29.04 this particular client to think it took her two years maybe more two and a half years of sending
01:23:29.04 --> 01:23:34.48 out resumes and accelerating her education and and practicing because she'd get an interview now
01:23:34.48 --> 01:23:40.48 and then and get very close to it to get that first move right but then she got two more in the
01:23:40.48 --> 01:23:47.44 next year and she was out tripler salary but you know it's like long terms strategic thinking
01:23:47.44 --> 01:23:53.20 followed by an implementable plan and then the willingness to tolerate an insane run of
01:23:53.76 --> 01:24:01.52 ridiculous failures before you move but I've seen that happen to people there's no reason that you can't
01:24:01.52 --> 01:24:06.32 move you just have to figure out where you want to move you have to figure out what the criteria are
01:24:06.32 --> 01:24:12.08 for putting you in that position and then you have to be some measure of insanely persistent because
01:24:12.08 --> 01:24:19.20 it's so unlikely right that the default answer to the question can I have this good job is
01:24:19.20 --> 01:24:25.68 are you out of your mind of course not right well it is it's like an even if you're qualified it's
01:24:25.68 --> 01:24:31.44 like yeah you and ten other people so there's even an element of chance at it especially at the end
01:24:31.44 --> 01:24:38.72 you don't like if you're in the top five you've done everything you can can do to control that
01:24:38.72 --> 01:24:44.16 outcome there's some element of chance that's going to be the determining variable because you know
01:24:44.16 --> 01:24:49.52 maybe I don't know maybe they didn't like the way your suit looked on you and that's the only
01:24:49.52 --> 01:24:53.04 thing that's differentiating you from the other candidate it's like you also don't want to take
01:24:53.04 --> 01:24:57.52 that to personally it's like what you hit the top five you were shortlisted you're in there man
01:24:57.52 --> 01:25:02.40 you're in there you're in the gap do that ten times you'll win one of those contests but you
01:25:02.40 --> 01:25:09.04 got to do it ten times so and you know even if it's lower in jobs like I've worked in lots of
01:25:09.04 --> 01:25:17.36 lower in jobs we talked about dishwasher yeah yeah yeah well you know I was dishwasher for
01:25:17.36 --> 01:25:21.84 while but then I was a shorter to cook yeah and you know but more than that more importantly than that
01:25:21.84 --> 01:25:28.000 even while I was a dishwasher washer once I kind of got the hang of it which was a lot harder
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:35.84 than you might think once I got the hang of it I was valued member of that team it's like
01:25:35.84 --> 01:25:39.04 while you're dishwasher it's like yeah that's one way of looking at it another way of looking
01:25:39.04 --> 01:25:43.20 at it's that I'm valued member of this team and that was actually fun like I was just a kid you know
01:25:43.20 --> 01:25:50.000 I was 14 and I was I did my job properly and I got treated like an adult it was like I loved that
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.96 I loved that that was great and so the fact that I was well are you a dishwasher or you a
01:25:54.96 --> 01:26:01.68 14 year old adult hey I'm a 14 year old adult hey I win I win that dishwasher no dishwasher
01:26:01.68 --> 01:26:05.84 it's like that's a good game and I really did like that I mean when I look back in my
01:26:05.84 --> 01:26:11.84 mid-adolescence it's certainly in the case that the the times that were the best for me when
01:26:11.84 --> 01:26:18.16 I was working in restaurants because I was I was part of the team man so
01:26:18.16 --> 01:26:25.04 you one of the sections in the book you talk about um I believe the person's name was lunchbox
01:26:25.04 --> 01:26:29.52 lunch bucket lunch bucket right for a little bit you know since we're talking about
01:26:30.48 --> 01:26:35.36 work environments and there's that certain level of camaraderie you actually talk about the
01:26:35.36 --> 01:26:40.72 seal teams in here where you just have this it's like a non and I've talked about this before
01:26:40.72 --> 01:26:49.12 in the seal teams it's non stop hyper verbal abuse aggression around the clock 24 hours
01:26:49.12 --> 01:26:56.96 day you're in a seal pool tune like that's the life any any mistake that you make any any
01:26:56.96 --> 01:27:04.16 display of weakness is gonna be especially contaminated we rip apart always gonna be ripped apart
01:27:04.16 --> 01:27:08.72 and then if you get all your tated about that it's even worse then you're just dead the nicknames
01:27:08.72 --> 01:27:13.36 you talked about lunch bucket your nickname was how do you how do you do the nicknames
01:27:13.36 --> 01:27:17.52 or the how do you which was which was pretty good about it yeah I'm from how do you do
01:27:17.52 --> 01:27:23.28 which is kind of so good how do you which is kind of cool right is western yeah but but
01:27:23.28 --> 01:27:28.48 the nicknames that that are in the seal teams like I can't with good conscience repeat them
01:27:28.48 --> 01:27:34.88 sure that they're just they're just horrible names but there's a camaraderie around that
01:27:34.88 --> 01:27:39.12 and there's also the way as I was reading what you'd written about these guys working on rail
01:27:39.12 --> 01:27:45.36 rate where are we crew yeah there's a test it's a test it's a test to see where you're at
01:27:45.36 --> 01:27:49.68 it's right you made up can we rely on you can you can you can you can you tolerate a little bit of
01:27:49.68 --> 01:27:53.52 irritation the answer that is no it's like well maybe we don't want you around then because
01:27:53.52 --> 01:27:59.36 some irritating things are likely to come down the pipe yeah and it's it's not just um
01:27:59.36 --> 01:28:04.48 to me to me it proves if you've got someone that can take it right it's not just that they can take
01:28:04.48 --> 01:28:09.12 some random joking insults like they can they can take it they can take it yeah that's
01:28:09.12 --> 01:28:13.28 what you're testing for it's like can you take it lunch pocket couldn't right because people
01:28:13.28 --> 01:28:17.84 would laugh at his lunch pocket and he'd get all upset it's like well you have a stupid lunch
01:28:17.84 --> 01:28:22.08 pocket it's like you know your mum packed it how about it you laugh at yourself yeah my mum packed
01:28:22.08 --> 01:28:25.84 this I know it's kind of stupid that would be the end of it he would just have to say that
01:28:25.84 --> 01:28:30.24 it's like but I didn't want to hurt her feelings it's like oh okay you know fine you got your
01:28:30.24 --> 01:28:35.44 stupid lunch pocket but no he couldn't handle that you know so yeah it was it was horrible
01:28:35.44 --> 01:28:39.44 had comical to watch at the same time because the level of and people have written me about that
01:28:39.44 --> 01:28:43.44 and they said oh you know poor lunch pocket it's like because they're all compassion I think no
01:28:43.44 --> 01:28:48.64 no not poor lunch pocket it's like clue the hell in buddy you had your chance you know that was a
01:28:48.64 --> 01:28:53.52 desirable job that real crew job in the summer because it was high paying you know and they weren't
01:28:53.52 --> 01:28:57.84 easy to come by those jobs and so the fact that he got hired onto that crew is a real opportunity
01:28:57.84 --> 01:29:02.72 for him you could make a pile of money in the summer out working on the rail crew and all you had to do is
01:29:04.48 --> 01:29:11.20 take some ribbing with good grace not suck up to the management too badly and not have other
01:29:11.20 --> 01:29:16.24 people do your job that was all that was all you had to do but he couldn't do that and so he got
01:29:16.24 --> 01:29:22.32 run off and it was like grow the hell up buddy you know these guys when 100 people are teasing you
01:29:22.32 --> 01:29:32.40 then probably they're not wrong yeah when you are getting tease like that as well
01:29:33.76 --> 01:29:40.000 well when you when you when you stop reacting it's no longer fun yeah yeah yeah well also gives you an
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.64 opportunity to tease back it's like yeah you can show your wit and one of the things that working
01:29:44.64 --> 01:29:48.96 class guys in particular which is what one of the things I really loved about working class jobs is that
01:29:48.96 --> 01:29:53.84 they're always looking for some humor so it's like if if person A is teasing person B that's kind
01:29:53.84 --> 01:30:00.08 of comical but if person B comes back with a good time back it's like not even better you know so
01:30:00.08 --> 01:30:04.16 I think that's a lot of how those jobs are rendered tolerable right it's their their hard
01:30:04.64 --> 01:30:10.72 dirty jobs dishwasher's a good example that's not dangerous although cooking is you know you
01:30:10.72 --> 01:30:17.52 gotta watch your step I got burned a lot when I was cooking but what makes those jobs not only
01:30:17.52 --> 01:30:22.56 tolerable but even desirable is that you can develop a tremendous amount of camaraderie around them
01:30:22.56 --> 01:30:27.52 I've never really experienced that at a professional level job that just doesn't happen the same way
01:30:27.52 --> 01:30:34.56 and it's really there's a real loss in that so it's it's it's it's fun to be part of a team that's doing
01:30:34.96 --> 01:30:42.000 you know grubby hands on things and and having a ridiculously entertaining vicious
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:48.000 cruel and evil time while you're doing it that's very entertaining the this new kids book I wrote so
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.28 uh the kid mark he's getting made fun of by this he's a different kind of bully he's like a mental
01:30:53.28 --> 01:31:00.80 bully that that verbally abuses people and he gets called plate face by this character and to
01:31:02.16 --> 01:31:05.92 it eventually gets in trouble for throwing a something at the kid because he's calling him plate face
01:31:05.92 --> 01:31:11.52 plate but eventually way he befriends the kid is by he they have to do a self portrait class he draws a picture of
01:31:11.52 --> 01:31:16.000 himself looking like a plate and he shows the kid the kid laughs and all of a sudden their buddies and it's like
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:24.72 that's what you do you take away that you take away the joy of of being so heated and irritated by
01:31:24.72 --> 01:31:28.56 people that are making fun of you and you just kill it right there too jutsu and some sense well
01:31:28.56 --> 01:31:34.96 I had an experience with that about three years ago I'd put my videos up online and people kept saying
01:31:34.96 --> 01:31:40.56 that I sounded like kermit well one person said it and I thought well whatever but then like five
01:31:40.56 --> 01:31:45.04 people said it and I thought oh my god like this kermit thing so then I went and listened to kermit
01:31:45.04 --> 01:31:51.68 and I thought oh no it's like it's like really I really sound like kermit you know and so then
01:31:51.68 --> 01:31:56.48 well then I started to play with it a little bit you know I used the puppet when I when I
01:31:56.48 --> 01:32:01.12 when I went to speak to university students and I made frog jokes and then I made a video
01:32:01.12 --> 01:32:07.60 that sort of featured me as a frog and it's crazy right it's ridiculous but but that's and but
01:32:07.60 --> 01:32:12.72 but the teasing never got mean because of that you know and the same things happened online
01:32:12.72 --> 01:32:17.52 to a larger degree as people keep making memes of me like and there's I don't know there's lots of them
01:32:17.52 --> 01:32:22.72 there's way too many to even keep track of and I was watching that happen and I thought okay this is a
01:32:22.72 --> 01:32:26.40 good thing because there's humor and wherever there's humor that's a good thing and they're making
01:32:26.40 --> 01:32:31.28 fun of me but it's gentle you know most of it was poki you know like well you sound like this
01:32:31.28 --> 01:32:35.04 damn puppet what do you think about it's like well if I had to pick someone to sound like
01:32:35.04 --> 01:32:39.36 probably wouldn't be a puppet but it had to be a puppet kermit's not a bad one it could be a lot
01:32:39.36 --> 01:32:44.80 worse it could be mispaggy yeah it could be not you know so thank god that didn't happen but the
01:32:44.80 --> 01:32:51.36 memes have never got vicious because you know I'll post them if they're funny and satirical and
01:32:51.36 --> 01:32:55.68 then they won't get vicious because they don't have to it's like can we poke fun of at you it's like
01:32:55.68 --> 01:33:00.48 yeah please do and the more the better really because that'll also help keep my feet on the ground
01:33:00.48 --> 01:33:04.96 and keep me awake and plus it's funny and like one of the things about life is that
01:33:05.76 --> 01:33:11.52 a sense of humor that's a good thing to to arm yourself with because sometimes you just don't have
01:33:11.52 --> 01:33:17.68 anything other than that like my daughter when she recounts her the horrors of her adolescent she
01:33:17.68 --> 01:33:22.72 she had to have her hip and her ankle replaced because they both deteriorated beyond repair
01:33:22.72 --> 01:33:28.24 beyond the possibility of repair and she was like an agony for literally for years it was just awful
01:33:28.24 --> 01:33:34.08 she can tell that story in a way that will just make you die of laughter and it's like well thank
01:33:34.08 --> 01:33:39.04 God for that because what else do you have in a situation like that man if you if and sometimes it's
01:33:39.04 --> 01:33:44.56 so dark that your sense of humor is just about gone and then you're in real trouble but lots of times
01:33:44.56 --> 01:33:48.72 that's what you've got against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune it's like
01:33:48.72 --> 01:33:53.04 you see this with people especially people who've been through really hard times and they're
01:33:53.04 --> 01:33:58.72 witty like things will be bleak bleak bleak and they'll crack a joke and you think well thank God man
01:33:58.72 --> 01:34:05.28 you can pop up above that and see above it a bit and and like you know tap it with a bit of irony
01:34:05.28 --> 01:34:09.92 and thank God for that so when the comedians start to get silence there's real trouble and
01:34:09.92 --> 01:34:14.56 that's been happening to some degree in Canada you know comedians are increasingly not willing to go
01:34:14.56 --> 01:34:20.72 speak on university campuses and that's when the comedians can't talk that's a really bad
01:34:20.72 --> 01:34:26.96 sight because that's the that comedy that's the triumph of the human spirit over adversity right
01:34:26.96 --> 01:34:32.40 that's why guys in these horrible jobs are often so unbelievably funny it's like well what else do
01:34:32.40 --> 01:34:38.56 they have you know and and actually that's a lot to be funny like that to that can that can
01:34:38.56 --> 01:34:44.24 move you through a lot of dismal so you know I I'm paying attention to time because I know in
01:34:44.24 --> 01:34:49.44 case someone can't tell that we're by an airport right now but to kind of bring this a little bit
01:34:49.44 --> 01:34:52.72 too close first of all we didn't cover anything that I wanted to cover today so we should all
01:34:52.72 --> 01:34:57.68 know that so you're coming back to do that with my talks like oh that's not the talk I plan
01:34:57.68 --> 01:35:02.48 well yeah your first biblical talk you covered the first line of Genesis right you made it one line
01:35:02.48 --> 01:35:08.64 deep and done half hours well done well done yeah but one of the things and I think it's a good
01:35:08.64 --> 01:35:13.12 note to end on at least a little bit to touch on because you're kind of talking about it right now
01:35:13.12 --> 01:35:17.76 is you know the last rule is to to pet a cat when you encounter one on the street yeah
01:35:18.64 --> 01:35:25.28 it's basically find a little bit of joy in these common things well it's a it's a chapter
01:35:25.28 --> 01:35:31.04 about about my daughter's experience and like it was a brutal man it was brutal she was literally
01:35:31.04 --> 01:35:36.72 walking around on two broken legs for two years and she had to take incredibly high doses of
01:35:36.72 --> 01:35:41.12 opiates and so had all the problems that went along with that she had to take riddle into stay awake
01:35:41.12 --> 01:35:46.56 it's like and she was in all likelihood she was dying there's a bunch of reasons for that and
01:35:46.56 --> 01:35:51.04 and those were just some of her health problems those were those weren't even the worst ones
01:35:51.04 --> 01:35:57.76 strangely enough so it was bloody brutal man and one of the things we told her and we managed this
01:35:57.76 --> 01:36:02.56 thank god as I told her once the disease started to develop she had rheumatoid arthritis very
01:36:02.56 --> 01:36:08.08 very seriously I said to her when she was a little kid said look kid this is gonna be rough man
01:36:08.08 --> 01:36:13.28 this is gonna be rough and and here's what you could do to make it worse it's like use your illness
01:36:13.28 --> 01:36:18.72 as an excuse you do that at your peril you do that a hundred times you will not be able to tell
01:36:18.72 --> 01:36:23.92 the difference between suffering that stops you from moving forward and an excuse for not
01:36:23.92 --> 01:36:30.88 living and you will be done it's never never never use your illness as an excuse like if you can't
01:36:30.88 --> 01:36:37.04 do it you can't do it you know we had a good experience without it's written in the book when
01:36:37.92 --> 01:36:42.40 we bought her a scooter because she couldn't use public transportation and we were all freaked out
01:36:42.40 --> 01:36:46.96 about that because like well she has damaged bones and you know broken hip and all of this is like
01:36:46.96 --> 01:36:52.96 you're gonna buy that kid a scooter really it's like well what are you gonna do keep her in her bedroom
01:36:52.96 --> 01:36:57.52 you want to think that's a good idea tell her she can't go out in the world it's like have the
01:36:57.52 --> 01:37:02.64 damn scooter so after awhile she had to get licensed for it there's a licensing procedure and
01:37:02.64 --> 01:37:06.96 to do that she actually had to write a motorbike and so she trained to write the motorbike
01:37:06.96 --> 01:37:11.76 like not very long after she had her hip replaced I think it was a six week something like
01:37:11.76 --> 01:37:15.44 that so of course we're all freaked out about that too because it's like oh man she has to
01:37:15.44 --> 01:37:20.32 write a motorbike and she has this hip and it's like what are we gonna do and she went and she
01:37:20.32 --> 01:37:25.84 did the motorcycle last first one but she dropped the bike a couple of times and some kid wiped out
01:37:25.84 --> 01:37:31.20 and rolled like 30 feet and that kind of freaked her out unsurprisingly and and so then the second
01:37:31.20 --> 01:37:35.04 day she went with her mom to do the motorcycle training she also got trained to write a motor
01:37:35.04 --> 01:37:41.84 motorcycle and the second day she woke up and she said I don't think I can do this and we thought
01:37:41.84 --> 01:37:47.36 well you know that's understandable it's like I can understand that and we talked through it we
01:37:47.36 --> 01:37:52.40 said look here's what to do man is like yeah you can't do it we understand why you're afraid of it
01:37:52.40 --> 01:37:59.84 you can't hold the bike up that well but why don't you just go like go in the car with your mom
01:38:00.40 --> 01:38:04.80 and see how you feel when you get there because you get close and you get right up to it
01:38:05.52 --> 01:38:10.40 maybe you can say no and you have to sit in the car and like that's life and we get it but
01:38:10.40 --> 01:38:14.80 maybe you don't have to and she went there so she thought that was okay and she went there
01:38:14.80 --> 01:38:19.12 and she picked up the damn motorbike and got her license and everybody cheered at the end and
01:38:19.12 --> 01:38:24.08 then she could drive her goddamn scooter around and thank God for that because you know she used
01:38:24.08 --> 01:38:28.80 to go out there and she put on her helmet and she'd go on her scooter and she was like ready to go
01:38:28.80 --> 01:38:34.08 out the world and so that's like that's the difference between making your kids safe and making them
01:38:34.08 --> 01:38:38.48 strong and it was touching bloody go you know because it could have easily been that she would have
01:38:38.48 --> 01:38:41.68 been in the little accident with her motorcycle and broken her leg and then we would have
01:38:41.68 --> 01:38:45.52 thought oh what kind of horrible parents are we she's already got problems and we put her on a
01:38:45.52 --> 01:38:51.12 damn scooter in the middle of the city it's like well you're going to be competent or you're
01:38:51.12 --> 01:38:57.20 going to be safe it's like there's nothing safer than competence and so and it was great for
01:38:57.20 --> 01:39:02.32 because it was just one more active courage you know and and she loved that damn scooter she had it
01:39:02.32 --> 01:39:09.36 for like six years and it was a really good idea risky as hell but really a good idea so yep
01:39:09.36 --> 01:39:17.76 well yeah again I'm looking at the clock we got to get you out of here first of all 12 rules for
01:39:17.76 --> 01:39:27.44 life and and it don't to chaos that's out right now it's number one on Amazon in America UK Canada
01:39:28.48 --> 01:39:36.72 everywhere that's pretty awesome I'm I'm yeah struck wordless by it yeah yeah
01:39:36.72 --> 01:39:42.80 everyone should just get it and because we didn't talk about anything I wanted to talk about today
01:39:44.56 --> 01:39:49.04 you come back we'll do this book and everyone likes to read the books if I keep they can before
01:39:49.04 --> 01:39:52.000 I do the podcast on them so to give everyone a chance to read it which would be awesome
01:39:53.12 --> 01:39:58.80 any other things well I should say I've got this online program called self-authoring
01:39:59.36 --> 01:40:05.92 and I'm offering your viewers a enlistner's a 20% discount that helps you write out an autobiography
01:40:05.92 --> 01:40:10.96 so you can figure out like what you haven't sorted out about your life it helps you write an
01:40:10.96 --> 01:40:15.52 analysis of your virtues in fault so you can rectify the faults and capitalize on the virtues
01:40:15.52 --> 01:40:21.12 and helps you make a plan for the future and I would say to your listeners don't be afraid to
01:40:21.12 --> 01:40:28.40 do it badly because a bad plan a bad account for yourself and a bad plan is way better than
01:40:28.40 --> 01:40:34.96 no account for yourself and no plan it's way better so do it do it badly it'll it'll help
01:40:34.96 --> 01:40:43.52 orient you in your life and we have a preponderance of of scientific data showing for example
01:40:43.52 --> 01:40:48.80 that people who've done the future authoring portion of this that's the plan are like 30% more
01:40:48.80 --> 01:40:53.84 likely to stay in university has an overwhelming effect and it works best on people who are doing
01:40:53.84 --> 01:41:00.16 worst which is really quite cool so there's that I have a personality test at understand myself
01:41:00.16 --> 01:41:06.08 calm and you can go there and get an analysis of 10 aspects of your personality it's kind of a harsh
01:41:06.08 --> 01:41:11.52 test like it'll tell you actually what you're like and it'll probably make you angry you know
01:41:11.52 --> 01:41:17.52 because maybe not but it probably will but it'll tell you it'll help you figure out what jobs you
01:41:17.52 --> 01:41:22.80 might be suited for but it'll also tell you where your week and could be stronger and so that's
01:41:22.80 --> 01:41:28.72 better medicine but but it's better to know it's better to know because then you can do something
01:41:28.72 --> 01:41:36.80 about it so I would say those are two useful things and I'd encourage people to they're inexpensive
01:41:36.80 --> 01:41:43.28 give them a try they'll they're helpful and on top of that you've got your podcast you've got your
01:41:43.28 --> 01:41:52.64 YouTube channel which has hundreds of hours worth of lectures and is fantastic Jordan Petersen
01:41:52.64 --> 01:41:59.20 dot com as well and well I just want to thank you for coming on the podcast again but more
01:41:59.20 --> 01:42:05.68 important I want to thank you for continuing to do what you do I know it's hard work and I know it's
01:42:05.68 --> 01:42:11.04 taxing on you and on your family life and all that yeah it beats suffering stupidly it does
01:42:11.04 --> 01:42:17.60 need and I know for a fact that you're having incredibly positive impact all over the world
01:42:17.60 --> 01:42:24.16 getting people everywhere to try to and to grow the hell out to grow up to grow up to speed up the
01:42:24.16 --> 01:42:33.68 truth make themselves and make thereby the world better place it could be a better place that would be
01:42:33.68 --> 01:42:41.20 good if we could manage that yeah indeed all right thanks for coming on you bet well we have excused
01:42:41.20 --> 01:42:48.48 Dr Jordan Peterson from the this is a recording studio no we're in a rented office make shift
01:42:48.48 --> 01:42:56.80 make shift Jordan had to go catch a plane and continue to get out there and make the world a
01:42:56.80 --> 01:43:02.88 better place good for him yes good for us and echo speaking of making the world a better place sure
01:43:02.88 --> 01:43:11.68 maybe you can let us know how we might be able to make our world a little bit better sure of course
01:43:12.56 --> 01:43:21.60 yeah first thing we can do is stay on the path oh and part of staying on the path is maintaining
01:43:21.60 --> 01:43:31.44 our physical capability and competent competency competency is it competence or competency competency
01:43:31.44 --> 01:43:38.96 we're gonna maintain that that's what we're gonna do on the path so we had jocquests of
01:43:38.96 --> 01:43:45.60 limits obviously we already know if you don't know krill oil joint warfare so jocquest super krill oil
01:43:45.60 --> 01:43:50.64 that's a krill oil supplement so joint where warfare is the glucosamine conjurting and
01:43:51.76 --> 01:43:58.32 curcumin yes very good things for your joints we you know at some point we'll go through
01:43:58.32 --> 01:44:04.48 everything that's in there not today yeah I do something so that because I don't want to
01:44:04.48 --> 01:44:12.80 turn talk about but it's good yeah it's good use it yeah you see the and it's not the kind where
01:44:12.80 --> 01:44:19.04 it's good because it's generally healthy to take these things which it is but that's not the the main
01:44:19.04 --> 01:44:28.72 push in my opinion check the main thing is that if your joints are kind of kind of off jacks or
01:44:29.44 --> 01:44:38.88 do you do you do a lot do anything but if you if you do brick laying what does that Mason
01:44:38.88 --> 01:44:46.72 Mason if you're yeah like just from you know back elbows and then you start taking this you'll see
01:44:46.72 --> 01:44:52.96 that you'll feel that different you know specifically yeah and it's generally healthy anyway
01:44:52.96 --> 01:45:00.32 maintain the joints maintain the competency of your joints with jockel super krill joint warfare
01:45:00.32 --> 01:45:06.40 take them every day that's what I do in the routine also discipline pre workout it's a pre workout for
01:45:06.40 --> 01:45:11.60 me it's it's a pre mission for me it's a pre mission free trade up pre motion cognitive
01:45:11.60 --> 01:45:17.68 yeah and answer yeah and I'll tell you the only downfall of it right now well there's a couple
01:45:17.68 --> 01:45:22.88 number one it tastes delicious so you want to drink a lot of it number two the other day I drink
01:45:22.88 --> 01:45:29.44 oh a lot of it I'm gonna have to go and give a speech yeah I had to use the restroom right before
01:45:29.44 --> 01:45:33.92 I went on stage of general like yeah it's be careful well that's a general thing I know I like
01:45:33.92 --> 01:45:38.64 it doesn't have to be jockel discipline yeah you can do that with water careful yeah yeah you
01:45:38.64 --> 01:45:42.56 want to be careful but think you eat some of it like oh can we eat that eight some of it today it's
01:45:43.52 --> 01:45:48.80 see I'll try to avoid that yeah yeah yeah see so I like to took a mouth a little scoop yeah
01:45:48.80 --> 01:45:55.92 and it's not too bad in fact you know what you know you get like a shot of some really nasty alcohol
01:45:56.80 --> 01:46:02.24 keep it sure but it gives you like a little yeah sure guys you look at some of that yeah
01:46:02.24 --> 01:46:06.32 when you take just when you eat the straight powder sure which I'm now doing apparently
01:46:06.32 --> 01:46:11.36 it's gives you a little bit it gives you a little not only you get the effects of what's
01:46:11.36 --> 01:46:16.40 it but you get a little bit of a the main line yeah yeah that's kind of like when you're
01:46:16.40 --> 01:46:20.16 kid you buy the little cool lady you know when you be for you make the cool lady you get like a
01:46:20.16 --> 01:46:26.32 little you try that stuff straight yeah yeah it's like only it's not quite as horrible is that
01:46:27.04 --> 01:46:30.48 better than that it's better than cool lady no oh yeah definitely better than cool
01:46:30.48 --> 01:46:34.48 good jockel made a taste good he's into the taste good stuff anyway it's called
01:46:34.48 --> 01:46:40.72 did joc this it's called discipline called this yeah you'll see it anyway get at origin main
01:46:40.72 --> 01:46:46.88 dot com and also at origin main dot com you get you that's where you can get your ghee
01:46:48.16 --> 01:46:53.28 so you don't have to well you can still ask me what ghee get no don't ask anymore not
01:46:53.28 --> 01:46:57.04 not ask good I'll tell you I'll tell you and this is what I'll tell you good origin pick a
01:46:57.04 --> 01:47:01.04 ghee from there whichever when you want plenty of color not plenty of colors but the legit color
01:47:01.04 --> 01:47:09.44 you I have white I have one blue ghee that I never use all I have is white I have a black
01:47:09.44 --> 01:47:12.88 ghee someone gave me a black ghee and this is cool but I've never used it but
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.80 because a lot of people ask me that too what color should I get yeah what color should you get
01:47:18.80 --> 01:47:24.32 I am very traditional and I use the white ghee but I do have a deaf ghee that's black
01:47:24.32 --> 01:47:28.40 black yes he's super dope but some schools they don't even allow other colors than white
01:47:28.40 --> 01:47:36.000 and blue yeah that's true but Pete says black is the is the number one seller okay like if
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:43.28 just all colors black now can you compete iBJJF with a black ghee I don't know I forget but
01:47:43.28 --> 01:47:48.80 here's what we were talking about when you're a little kid and you think about martial arts what
01:47:48.80 --> 01:47:55.60 do you want to be the ninja you want to be an ninja yeah so now you got a 36 year old guy or a 28 year
01:47:55.60 --> 01:48:02.08 old guy and he finally he's feeling kind of ninja yes yeah what is he doing the legit too yeah
01:48:02.08 --> 01:48:07.12 then he's take that one extra step and he's got a black ghee boom ninja yeah in a matter of
01:48:07.12 --> 01:48:12.32 speaking yeah and I actually felt that that's part of the reason why I don't get a black ghee because
01:48:12.32 --> 01:48:17.84 I I kind of wanted like not like there's all Charles Bronson movie feathers what do you mean
01:48:17.84 --> 01:48:23.60 on old Charles Bronson movie called the mechanic yeah yeah there's a there's a there's a scene
01:48:23.60 --> 01:48:29.60 where their traditional karate guy is gonna fight a guy that's got some new tricks up his sleeve
01:48:29.60 --> 01:48:36.24 sure and the traditional karate guy has to get nuts on him yeah but these are just a plain white
01:48:36.24 --> 01:48:41.68 ghee yeah yeah yeah that's the tradition and Charles Bronson too yeah so I'm just you know
01:48:41.68 --> 01:48:47.76 yeah and in the line strangely I mainly stick to white because it's kind of that's the main like
01:48:47.76 --> 01:48:53.28 I'm not doing too much with the with the cool black one because the black one like I
01:48:53.28 --> 01:48:58.96 said about being ninja and it looks cool bright does it's really cool and but I didn't want to
01:48:58.96 --> 01:49:03.60 roll in and be like and they think oh what if you carry the girl cool with your black ghee kind of
01:49:03.60 --> 01:49:09.12 think you know the thing is I think it's progressed beyond that it's totally honest it's beyond that
01:49:09.12 --> 01:49:16.08 yeah you're not you're not standing out at all you have a black ghee now you might be if you go to
01:49:16.08 --> 01:49:20.88 a traditional you know school that has only white ghee yeah you're gonna stand out you come in
01:49:20.88 --> 01:49:23.68 and victory MMA in fitness you could be wearing a purple ghee no one's gonna care yeah I
01:49:23.68 --> 01:49:26.96 won't even look into your second camouflage yeah no one cares they might be like dang that's a
01:49:26.96 --> 01:49:32.96 cool camouflage ghee they might say that they might just put choke hold on you and get after it yeah
01:49:33.36 --> 01:49:40.24 so there it is I would say okay if they're saying hey jocco echo what ghee should I get what
01:49:40.24 --> 01:49:45.60 color should I get we know origin what color should I get a ask your school first yeah because
01:49:45.60 --> 01:49:51.44 some they don't allow you're gonna buy your cool black ghee or there's like army greener is there army greener
01:49:52.16 --> 01:49:55.76 you're gonna buy and they looked up and you're solid you're ready to go and you come in they
01:49:55.76 --> 01:50:00.24 see you can't train with that you can't have that some ask your school first if they allow all colors
01:50:01.20 --> 01:50:08.16 then that ones up to you yeah yeah but but the the point is with asking what color is that I think I
01:50:08.16 --> 01:50:13.92 think that they're like hey is there like a violation if I get this cool black one and you answer
01:50:13.92 --> 01:50:19.60 to it yeah now no unless your school does literally no factor literally no factor yeah
01:50:20.40 --> 01:50:27.20 so they got a you know an origin mean dot com that's where you get them also on it dot com slash jocco
01:50:27.20 --> 01:50:35.44 this is where I get the kettlebells the dope kettlebells you didn't talk about rash rash guards
01:50:35.44 --> 01:50:41.76 oh and origin yeah yeah and because the reason that I popped into my mind because they have spats now
01:50:41.76 --> 01:50:49.04 because they have spats now the first runa spats are green and like some other color yeah yellow
01:50:49.04 --> 01:50:56.24 line green yeah right you just didn't you don't worry I sent p to text now I'm not a got spats
01:50:56.24 --> 01:51:00.96 wearing dude I'm not wearing tights not happening just nothing against people that do there's some
01:51:00.96 --> 01:51:07.92 crazy due to two guys out there that are wearing tights like you read about yeah but I said I said
01:51:07.92 --> 01:51:14.32 AP not wearing tights yeah I know a lot of people that do make some black ones or something else
01:51:14.32 --> 01:51:21.04 yeah and he said got it yeah you can get obviously the rash guards are good to go yeah but now you
01:51:21.04 --> 01:51:27.52 can also get spats that are not so we're sticking with spats we're seeing what spats when we
01:51:27.52 --> 01:51:32.16 figured out the root of spats right or dope yeah it's a good thing yeah it's not it's I thought it
01:51:32.16 --> 01:51:39.12 would root back to you know some yeah some ballerina thing no it's a war yeah it's what you
01:51:39.12 --> 01:51:44.16 worn your legs when you're a cow for women yeah so we can say spats it's been approved yeah
01:51:44.16 --> 01:51:48.80 full of stuff yeah it's the same thing yeah it's you you take your shoe and your so we're good
01:51:48.80 --> 01:51:53.60 ankle yeah fully interesting color choice yeah the first one here's the thing though
01:51:53.60 --> 01:52:01.84 yeah about the spats yeah some colors you don't see like like if I was like hey I'm
01:52:01.84 --> 01:52:06.64 gonna wear this lime green and yellow thing whatever shirt spats whatever and you'd be like
01:52:06.64 --> 01:52:10.80 lime green yellow that just doesn't even sound good I'm looking at these two colors I don't think
01:52:10.80 --> 01:52:14.40 that's gonna look good but then you put it on a shirt or spats or something and then you put it on
01:52:14.40 --> 01:52:18.64 you're like oh dang that kind of works for some reason I'm not saying lime green and yellow does that
01:52:18.64 --> 01:52:23.68 I'm just saying certain color yeah combination here's the interesting thing peats my bro right
01:52:23.68 --> 01:52:31.68 sure me yeah literally with the first time I had a Skype conversation with Pete my wife is like
01:52:31.68 --> 01:52:35.68 it sounded like you were talking to yourself right because we and we know there's a four hour conversation
01:52:35.68 --> 01:52:42.000 by the way dang real now with that that being said I wouldn't have made spats that look like
01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.24 the first spats to be it come out with a million years now here's now here's the funny thing
01:52:46.24 --> 01:52:52.08 okay I can't even say I can't even say hey Pete don't you know no one's gonna like those you
01:52:52.08 --> 01:52:59.36 know why because my sense of fashion yeah is so off my sense of fashion is not exist yeah with
01:52:59.36 --> 01:53:04.24 it's literally not exist it would be not exist if you even had one yeah okay that's right well
01:53:04.24 --> 01:53:10.16 no it's not exist if you had one it would get it it's like double none okay yeah well so
01:53:10.16 --> 01:53:15.12 that's why I can't even say hey Pete I can't say I can't make a blanket saving like Pete
01:53:15.12 --> 01:53:21.84 people won't like those yeah I can't even say that because I have no idea so I just said what I do
01:53:21.84 --> 01:53:28.64 know is people would definitely like some black ones right yeah that's pretty safe to say so yeah
01:53:28.64 --> 01:53:34.000 yeah I don't mind the greener by the way but there you go no you even we've had this stuff we've
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:38.40 had issues like this yes where you make things that I just don't yeah I'm not I'm the other
01:53:38.40 --> 01:53:42.72 on approved yeah on approved cross the board yeah but I just know you just kind of just don't know
01:53:42.72 --> 01:53:48.16 yeah I say okay you know I don't know that's I gotta stay humble over here yeah I can't claim to
01:53:48.88 --> 01:53:56.16 claim to have any any footing to stand on at all when it comes to fashion but that's any kind
01:53:56.16 --> 01:54:01.92 yeah and haircuts I'm pretty good with those you know what yeah sure if you had okay next question
01:54:04.48 --> 01:54:09.28 so yeah again origiming.com there's a lot of cool stuff on there's hoodie and stuff too by the way
01:54:09.28 --> 01:54:15.36 yeah which and this is a this is a buy it not biased what you call subjective
01:54:16.24 --> 01:54:24.56 when I was wearing the full origin sweat suit I don't I lay down on the couch just took a
01:54:24.56 --> 01:54:30.32 break whatever no I don't normally do that to break from what cruising you know you know
01:54:30.32 --> 01:54:35.20 doing whatever it is I was doing took a break lay down on the couch full sweat suit on origin
01:54:35.20 --> 01:54:42.80 it was the most comfortable moment I had in recent memory and just so everyone knows if you're talking
01:54:42.80 --> 01:54:52.40 about echoes comfort levels they're already you know comfort I know about it very familiar with it
01:54:52.40 --> 01:54:58.32 and yeah it was not saying a lot so yeah there it is okay back to on it the kettlebells that I get
01:54:58.32 --> 01:55:09.04 whole set up so I'm a set primal bills zombie bills legend bills they're the kettle bills
01:55:09.68 --> 01:55:14.72 that's where you get them on it.com slash jockel also they got some cool maces on there
01:55:14.72 --> 01:55:22.32 jockel is the mace right I do yeah but yeah one pounder you think 20 pounds is not heavy yeah
01:55:22.32 --> 01:55:26.64 it's heavy yeah it's really heavy that's one of those things and we kind of talked about it before
01:55:26.64 --> 01:55:34.24 where you wait like wait like this many pounds or you know kilos whatever it's not
01:55:34.24 --> 01:55:41.92 created equal like if it's shaped in a certain form yeah or formless or whatever that's way different
01:55:41.92 --> 01:55:47.20 yeah like my daughter I think I forget how much you've been weighs now like 53 pounds or something like
01:55:47.20 --> 01:55:51.68 that you think the puns is nothing this far as lifting this for you lift it yeah try lift
01:55:51.68 --> 01:55:59.04 31 she don't want to be lifted right she's like she's a good piece like 150 pounds nonetheless

01:59:38.80 --> 01:59:42.40 actually they say that this is the u and i and i and where the same thing every day for the same
01:59:42.40 --> 01:59:49.68 reason yeah because you're decision making you know resources yeah i don't really believe all that
01:59:49.68 --> 01:59:52.72 i just believe i don't feel like sitting around thinking about what i'm gonna wear in the morning
01:59:52.72 --> 01:59:57.28 just grab the i have a shirt or guess what i'm sure it's put it on right you have bigger things to
01:59:57.28 --> 02:00:01.76 make decisions about it think about that's exactly what i'm saying that's what i read too so
