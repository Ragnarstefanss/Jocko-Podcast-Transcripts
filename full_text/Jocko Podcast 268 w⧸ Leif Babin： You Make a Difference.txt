I don't know you put your own spend on it, right? I mean that's hard When he gets warmed up, just does it so well though. I mean the bars high we we were we were backstage At the first jockel live actually was it wasn't jockel. I was New York City Oh, yeah, and someone someone said something you like oh, are you nervous? And you said well a little bit and then Well, okay, I'm I'm trying to craft the conversation Maybe that didn't happen the way you're looking at me like it. I'm talking to you and Somehow you rehearsed your lines. No, no, you were it was it was tie was making the video and You were like you know I'm over here going over what I'm gonna say and No, that was me taking a nap first something I think it was just impassing tie was making a video okay.

Did you if you listen to it for one for that for one sixty in New York? Yeah, when you when I say good evening I was like good evening it like I jammed it up. I think in that weird you have one job one Yes, is the pressure great run you right it goes words right exactly Well, what was crazy about that? Well, it's like no you didn't know what I was gonna talk about no and the only person that knew I was gonna talk about was me and I knew I was gonna go out there and talk about Seth and it was gonna be like as Heart of a thing as I could possibly have to go and talk about and so you're all kind of hey You know cool. This is a crowd and it'll be fun and I'm sitting there thinking how am I gonna get through this? Yeah, and then I do get through my part and then you screw up your part Thankfully in a way I screwed up my part before you did your part You know I knew something was kind of I don't want to say off because it wasn't off But something was a little bit different when you rolled up like when you came on to the stage That's when you wait a second but Something's different right now because I didn't know what was going on at that time. Yeah, but which is weird I didn't give you any heads up at all. No, sir. You did not what a savage So hey man, it's real. Yeah, you did that to me at the the jockel live Lost as well Link no heads up whatsoever and you read you know reading sets words and Talk about us work together and stuff. He's written about me that I never even heard you know hurt hurt before No, it was I was like balling my eyes out the back of Actually, okay, look to be afterwards You go how about a heads up next time and I go sorry bro. You go I was openly weeping I was like that's rough Yeah Well, it's so anyways, let's hear you're good evening one more time. Wave. I mean what we got Good evening there you go. I mean everyone always everyone always likes the late Bab and Texas Batman Thing that you yeah, you've got going on right? Okay, I guess you can just gargle rocks or The Ellen scream of the sound of gunfire. Do you remember when we were in South Africa on the radio? I do If you ever shared that story with anyone in your life particularly the person that you're married to We're on this radio show because they pop in the radio show in South Africa and you know We're getting interviewed about leadership and we're talking and these These females are calling into the show and they're like that man's voice is amazing What I can't do this out the African voice, but it was it was pretty funny wait That's but is that public that that interview? You too great. Maybe I think I saw that. It was pretty funny. I remember you guys being in South Africa on the In that radio show and it's on YouTube Okay, there you go. We can look it up. There you go. We can tag it. Wait, what do they say? We'll put that in the show notes. I would say that but I know that there's a limited chance of you putting anything in the show notes I don't know it's on the on the podcast You know you can put YouTube the description for also people do that on you know When people put a podcast on iTunes for instance, you can put links in their echo Yeah, you can put them in the show notes So people say I'll link it in the show notes. All right, so I'm not making any Remote promises about anything being the show notes Yes, I guess you can use your Google fingers if you want to see a Lave getting a complemented by the ladies of South Africa or what's they some of the ladies in South Africa? It's on YouTube It's it's it's out there. All right, so now that we've gotten through that Let's get into the subject of the night the subject of the night is the squad leader makes a difference The squad leader makes a difference and with decentralized command Which is the fourth law of combat leadership? This is Undisputable it's undisputable that the squad leader makes a difference because with decentralized command everybody leads you want everybody to be a leader and lately I've been talking about the fact that the purest and highest form of decentralized command is actually culture And if you have a strong culture inside of an organization Then the people in the organization at any level can make decisions based on the culture of the organization Just based on the culture they can figure out what to do if you have a strong culture If it's we take care of the customer think of how many decisions you can make if you know Hey, our our culture is to take care of the customer you can make all kinds of decisions if Your culture is we have the highest quality We make the highest quality product. I don't should I cut the corner here? No, you shouldn't should I should I get a little cheaper material to put in here? No, you shouldn't we make the highest Quality product which means that culture drives decision making We have the best value we give the best value. Oh, what does that mean? We're gonna try and maintain that low price We can make decisions. You know what we can shave off a little bit of money there and we can get a better value for our clients So you can make all kinds of decisions with that and The military has culture to and Units in the military different units in the military right down to the platoon level have a culture that can also drive decision making It can drive good decision making actually and It can also make it can also drive bad decision making right if you have bad culture it can actually drive bad decision making so Real obvious example bad culture is a bad culture of blaming others of not taking ownership and if you're not taking ownership You have a culture where nothing ever gets fixed That's what's happening. So if our culture is To blame everyone else. We're not we're not gonna improve. We're not gonna get any better obviously Again, if we have a culture where we're cutting corners and what about it? That's what accidents happen If we have a culture where we're looking out for me Right, that's looking out for for a jocco Well, then we're not covered moving for each other not there to cover move for someone that needs help If I've got a culture of micro management I guess what no one's gonna have any initiative because the culture isn't what we'll sit around and wait and get told what to do So you can see how these cultures Drive bad decision making of course culture can also drive a good decision making Right with with good culture if you've got good culture if you've got a culture of ownership If everyone in your team has got the culture where hey, we take ownership. We solve problems guess what That culture's gonna drive people to say hey, you know what that's my fault. Let me fix it So we want that culture of Ownership we want the culture where people don't cut corners. We want the culture where people look out for their teammates We want culture where people are empowered and they make things happen So it's it's real obvious how powerful culture can be and I think sometimes people think about culture as Is like non-clonifiable Well, you know they have a good culture, but what is that really what does that produce what does that give you the reality is if you have good culture It is extremely powerful. It's the highest form of decentralized command and decentralized command is extremely powerful in its own right So then the question becomes okay How do we actually create culture? How do we do that? How are we gonna create culture? And the answer is if you Think about it for a little bit the answers that you create culture the same way that culture has always been created how how does culture get created? We have to tell the story We have to have we have to we have to share this story. We have to explain what we've been through what we've done together Who we are what our history is what we stand for and actually and actually why we stand for that And if you can carry on that story if you can tell that powerful story you can create a culture Now We can't just make the story up We can't just we can't we can't just fabricate us to actually no We actually can't you actually can't just create a a a story almost out of thin air and if you If you use that story if you use that lie To replace the story and you tell that lie for long enough it becomes the truth right 1984 That's exactly what that's the whole premise of 1984 We control He who controls what is it who controls the past controls the president who controls the present controls the future? No, who controls the present controls the past and who controls the past controls the future? Whatever order you want to put those in if I can convince you that this is the story This is the history this is where we came from I can manipulate the culture So so it actually can be done but that takes like a massive kind of universal propaganda machine to make that happen And I think the the better way to do that and what we should do and what good meters do is to base the story That develops into our culture based that obviously based in the truth That's the most powerful way to create a culture Is to tell that truthful story to hold up those examples From the path from the past those those values that got us to where we are Those heroes that stood for those values you tell that story and that becomes the culture And one of the strongest cultures that I've ever been around is the culture of the United States Marine Corps And they do it in a bunch of different ways But what we're going to talk about today is a shining example it's a shining example of how to create culture because they have a manual They have a manual the manual is called the squad leader makes a difference Think about this black belt move they make a they make a document that's called the squad leader makes a difference So obviously they want to have decentralized command they want their squad leaders to step up and lead So they make a whole manual that's called the squad leader makes a difference And it goes further to set the culture inside the document itself because in this book The squad leader makes a difference which is subtitles subtitled readings on combat at the squad level And it's from the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab Which is a legit name for something at Quantico. It's put this thing was put together in 1998 by a couple of lieutenant's M.M. Obaldi no idea how to pronounce your name. I apologize and a M. O' Terror So these guys put together this manual and you're going to see that what it is actually doing is is telling these stories and building a culture of decentralized command Where everyone is a leader and the squad leaders can make a difference Lave I was thinking when you were at the Naval Academy What examples how was that culture like when when you looked at the Marine Corps? Or did that culture permeate into the young Lave Babin brain and pull you in that direction a little bit? Yeah for sure. I mean we had some outstanding Not-convition officers Sergeant Major that ran our PT and he'd come running by at 4 o'clock at the morning and yelling for the brigade of M.M. to get up Yeah, there was a lot of that was In fact our member owned parents Parents weekend so you go through like the pleaps summer Which is so you just show up in the Naval Academy. It's kind of boot camp in the Naval Academy It's pleap we call pleaps summer So you show up in the running all these midshipmen to boot camp You're kind of going to that boot camp style and toward the end of that your parents show up for Parents weekend and they can visit for a few days and see you and then they take off but He was like talking to the parents who he's who he's from Maine and so you know If you feel raised their hand like oh yeah he's from Maine. He's like I'm from Maine too the main part of Paras Island And it just starts laughing. It was just you know that was certainly instilled in Austin and Everyone has to go through you know whether you're gonna be a ship driver in the Navy or some Marines or fireplanes or whatever you have to go through You know at least at least a two or three week program that's kind of like OCS Down in Quantico I mean they they do it at OCS in Quantico for the Marine Corps see you get a taste of that regardless and So that whole the whole thing of every Marine arrive woman and putting folks through that was It was very appealing to me and I went there because I wanted to be a seal But certainly Marine ground it was my second choice. Yeah, I did not get selected for Dang um Two things isn't it interesting the way that just saying that this guy would run by it for a clock in the morning Just makes you think good to go That's number one. I would always go through Oster Canada School which is also run by Well the Marine Corps is are the are the children's structures and We would we're we're going for a run and every day we'd run through like a Like a officer real officer housing where the officers that were stationed in Pensacola lived and you know Every day we'd be singing cadence and then you go through there and you have to get quiet and they would just do like a quiet Little cadence just to keep you in step and then you'd get through and then you start singing again and you know it'd be four or five o'clock in the morning or whatever So one time we got this this one Jolensh Doctor wasn't my normal Jolensh Doctor. It was this other Jolensh Doctor took us for a run and he was He was new and he was all kinds of fired up and so we so we get to that area and he like It gets real quiet and so you know He's saying whatever the cadence was and then all of a sudden he he sings as the cadence He's like get out of the rack like quiet and we're all like get out of the rack and he's like get out of the rack and we're like get out of the rack And he get out of the rack and so we're five o'clock in the morning Run by all these officers housing and by the end. We're just The rack and just screaming and that was a good time I was like hmm, so that's what the Marine Corps does that's what the Marine Corps does they make a human being say I'm from Maine the main part of Paris Island that's what the Marine Corps does and we must Salute them for that so this book is one of those things right when I'm on my When I'm on my tri-trails Through the world I stumble upon these things this is one of those things. I saw that title And like you've got to be kidding me what is this? So The squad leader makes a difference reading on combat at the squad level volume one and by the way this is volume one I have not been able to find volume two three four five or six so Maybe these guys got sent somewhere from the Marine Corps war fighting live and didn't ever make another one But let's get into it Here's the forward in combat Sometimes when I read these things I think every single thing that I'm about to read I just read it and stop this is one of those things so in combat The actions of individual leaders affect the outcome of the entire battle Squad leaders make decisions and take actions which if which can affect the operational and strategic levels of war Well trained squad leaders playing important role as combat decision makers on the battlefield Leaders who show initiative judgment and courage will achieve decisive results not only at the squad level But in the broader context of battle Without competent squad leaders capable of carrying out of a commander's intent even the best plans are doomed to failure So you know You hear about the general and the Colonel and the captain and even the gunnery sergeant You hear about the Marine Corps leadership and and yes, they're outstanding But when you're a corporal and you read this you think you know what I got to get mine too Think of how awesome that is and and from a you know from a business perspective How how how how how how how do you what story do you tell your Employees what story do you tell the people that work inside your organization? What story do you tell them do you tell them that that that they are decision makers? Do you tell them that their judgment and initiative will drive results at the strategic level? Do you ever tell you to team that? That's how you set the culture That you know as you as you're reading that I'm thinking about as a student of history and I love reading history books and obviously you do you know It's not some amazing books here on the podcast But we always talk about it from the big you know the big the commander the general why you read You know Julia sees her maneuvered his his or Alex end of the great did this or Napoleon did this or Pat and move disarm me here And He might have been making some overall decisions, but the army that's moving is the the front line leaders out there The squad leaders that are executing that make it happen and I love the way we do that echelon front We're our definition of leadership as everybody is a leader and you said something Recently that I hadn't thought about it that way, but we're okay Who is actually a leader if you interact with humans in some way and actually need them to go in a direction and work together provide a resource or are support then you actually are a leader and I think when you see yourself that way I mean the most powerful armies in the world the most powerful teams companies in the world are gonna see themselves What everyone sees themselves a leader able saw problems and make things happen and move the team forward in the direction I need to go Yeah, that's um and that's one of the best things about this podcast is that I get to I get to read books not written by the general not written by the admiral but written by A rifle one of Napoleon's riflemen or a machine gun or installing rod like that's what that's who we're that's who we're hearing from and what's what's what's Powerful about that is then you get to see You get to know you get to learn how that leadership is perceived by the troops on the front line I mean that that podcast that we did about style and God where you they were hearing Hitler Talk about them being gone They were still there they were surrounded they were fighting for their lives and they were hearing the broadcast of Hitler Saying it was a great sacrifice and they stood to the last man. They're like we're still here What are you doing? Give us help give us support let us let us break out no And You realize oh those those those people on the front lines They do they they make such a big difference And if you set the culture correctly they will have even more impact Goes on this This public this publication illustrates how bold imaginative squad leaders impact the outcome of a battle or campaign The historical examples here represent some of the cases in which squad leaders were able to change the course of history Did I just say a squad leader change the course of history? Yes, I did In each case the squad leader had to make a quick decision without direct orders Act independently and accept responsibility for the results Short lessons are presented at the end of each story these lessons should help you realize how important your decisions are to your Marines and your commander In combat you must think beyond the squad level you must develop opportunities for your commander to exploit Your every action must support your commanders intent you must be competent in the combat skills required of a combined arms leader You are the primary war fighter of the Marine Corps Boom Freaking legit I think about how often like how different that is right from a culture of centralized command Where the senior leaders like we owe the frontline troops just don't get it they don't know what's good They don't understand and Then the front line troops like the guys up in the ivory tower, you know the senior leaders they don't get if they don't understand what's going on here Versus it you know where people are just sitting around waiting to be told what to do versus the The team that's actually empowered to step up and lead and make things happen and that team is just unstoppable unstoppable Here's some coats that this thing starts off with the most brilliant plan Depends for its tactical execution on the squad leaders poor squad leaders may ruin the best laid plans First rate squad leaders often save badly devised plans The squad leader is the sole level of command that maintains direct contact with the men who do the actual fighting The follow's then that the squad leader is to be trained as a tactical commander and as an educator of his men that's interesting because You know when we talk about Span of control and on the battlefield, you know you can have Four five six guys and you can pretty much Control you can per you can you can you can you can make things happen You know when you've got four five six guys Maybe seven it starts getting really wonky at eight But that's because you can see them they're right there you can you can move four feet and you can grab life and say hey You can move move a little further forward you can actually just make things happen through direct supervision so that's that's That's very important to remember that these squad leaders and ones that actually have the contact to make things happen You go up one level you go from the squad to the platoon Well that puts you in commander can't get to that kid over on the left flank He can't get to that machine gunner up on that no, he's not gonna be able to get there He's not gonna be able to make it happen and that's why as you grow you have to get better at the laws of combat You have to get better decentralized command you have to get better to keep things simple you have to get better prioritize and actually you have to get better cover move Because You don't have that direct control anymore You can't just You know use your Force of will to make things happen go grab a guy you need to get over here doesn't work anymore Continuing on the IDF this guy is Israeli the IDF squad leaders are trained to command independently in the field Modern armies operate in small dispersed formations all levels of command must be trained to think and act independently Modern weapons which provide small groups of men greater fire power and flexibility of movement Call for a high standard of command at all levels and this is something that we've been able to walk through and and I apologize that it hasn't been chronological in nature but When the machine gun came We had to start using decentralized command because if we're all bunched up together We're all gonna die together. So that's when world war one towards the end of world war one We started getting decentralized command. It started having the squad like you're not gonna be with me anymore Hey, lay from we go on this mission I'm not gonna be able to give you any guidance at all as the company commander because you're gonna be 400 meters away We have no radios and you just are gonna have to make things happen. You have to know what we're trying to make happen. You gotta go do it on your own So This idea that you know when you saw the the red coats right line up and we're gonna march together That's the old way of war. I mean the the Romans the failanks like all the old formations of war. I was like we're all together We can just Maintain good control over this big group easier because we're all co-located and Modern warfare brought us to hey, I'm not right there We launched on this mission and I might not see you again until the mission's complete So the people that are out there leading have to know what they're doing why they're doing it they have to understand the commanders intent And they have to take initiative to get to that goal Then he falls he concludes this with the squad leader therefore The squad leader is therefore to be trained technically as an officer not as a corporate And that's from Yigal Alon who is a field commander in these really defense force and He actually was a scout with the brids in World War II fought in Syria fought in Lebanon Founding member of the Israeli strike force so some experience First they kicked this whole thing off and this is actually a big shocker to me. They kicked this off by talking about Corporal Alvin York United States Army All right, so I Expect that this to be all Marines, but the Marine Corps is awesome and they said hey these are awesome examples of where a squad leader made a difference and we're gonna use them France 1918 the Muse Argon offensive was the last important battle of the first World War on the night of September 1918 over one million American soldiers moved up to relieve the French forces on the front lines The American advance that ensued swept easily through the first two lines of German trenches and Then progress slowed facing stiff resistance the reserve division was called up Corporal Alvin York served as an infantry man in the 82nd division York's company started across a valley at six in the morning as they began to move the company came Under heavy fire from behind a hill enemy machine guns mode down the first wave of advancing Americans No one knew where the deadly fire was coming from so York's platoon sergeant decided to take the platoon on a mission to find it The platoon found a gap in the enemy lines and circled to the rear where they thought the machine guns might be The group of Americans stumbled across two German leader bearers whom they followed back to the headquarters of the machine gun Battalion The Americans walked right into the German machine gun command post open fire and the Germans immediately surrendered Upon hearing the fire behind them the Germans that were dug in near the command post swung their weapons around and began firing at the Americans caught in the open in a hail of automatic fire the Americans instantly took casualties Corporal York took aim at the nearest machine gun about 25 yards away and killed the man behind the gun He continued to fire at each German who popped his head out of a foxhole After watching his troops being massacred by this lone sharpshooter the German major in command yelled to York If you'll stop shooting I'll make them surrender Work on your marksmanship people work on your marksmanship Within minutes the remaining American troops had captured 90 German prisoners But they were behind enemy lines Corporal York took charge and quickly organized his platoon He decided to move back towards friendly positions straight through the German lines York ordered the German prisoners to carry back the American wounded Every time the group came upon a German position York told the captured German major to order the troops to surrender The well-disciplined German soldiers never questioned the order and by the time York's small band reached friendly lines They had acquired 132 German prisoners In their wake York's platoon left 35 deserted German machine gun positions and a significant gap in the German defenses This gap which York had created was a vital element to the success of the division's advance This advance gave momentum to the American forces and contributed to the success of the offensive phenomenal Here's the lessons Corporal York was quick to exploit the opportunity which had been created He realized that his actions would affect the outcome of the battalions advance and made decisions which supported his commanders intent His strong situation awareness guided him in taking action which had decisive results You know when you think even when I think when I think of World War one soldiers You I definitely envision someone that's much more obedient than what we have in the modern all volunteer military today Right, you've got someone to say I mean, I always say the whole world was more obedient right you had a much more stringent class structure in America You had the much further separation between the officers and the enlisted and So for this kid To be like oh I got this It's incredible it's incredible to show that kind of initiative and I think the fact that it was in World War one is even more incredible Think about what what would happen if he was just standing around waiting to be told what to do in that situation though Which is what so many leaders we work with think is the right call like you should just wait to be told what to do and Then do you know carry on orders without question and and he would just be standing there waiting to be told what to do and and they would fail And maybe the whole offensive fails as a result instead of someone who actually understands the why understands the commanders Intent and the purpose of knowing what what they're trying to do and can take the initiative to go make things happen Yeah, you know what I often say and I'm about I don't want yes, man, right? I don't know if someone that's just like yep, hey sounds good. Jocco Sounds great. You know you want someone that's gonna push back and like I haven't agree with that wait what about this Take that one step further It's like I want someone that's just gonna figure out what to do and go freaking executed right that's what we want That's what we're trying that's what we want that's what we're trying to grow this we're trying to Develop in our support and leadership is that they're gonna look Even look beyond even look beyond what I can see and say oh I bed if I did this it would be a good move and Maybe they're batting 80 percent. I'm good with that I'd rather have somebody batting 80 percent on 80 percent good moves that took initiative and made things happen and 20 percent of the time I got to go oh life hey hold what you got man. Don't go over there yet Much rather have that Initiative But that's some you've you've helped me with as well though with because I think it's a hard thing for a lot of leaders to accept Because like well, you know we got to come up with the right solution. We don't want to make mistakes And we want to move forward and When you're you're like less than 80 percent Solutions that go 80 percent solutions ago where we're never gonna have a perfect plan So let's let's get the plan as close you know In a good direction and then execute an execute an and have the initiative BD fall aggressive I think I think that's I know it can stifle me and I've struggled with that And I'm not executing because I'm trying to get it to the 97 percent solution Like listen 80 percent solution start moving things forward execute and I think that's very empowering to think about that You don't have to have the perfect plan. Yeah. You gotta just go yeah very Librating to be like oh, yeah, I don't care about that Hey, well, what we might not be oh, yeah, I don't care You know we well, what if you don't care about that suits that that they'll over there. Yeah get there Well, do you want me to have a logistics not a care about that? I want well, do you want me to do it in the data? I don't care Well, do you want no, I don't care when you get that hill Okay, but let's do it the point I'm making here though is is you know Even whether it's actual on front or working together and task in a bruiser In you know there can be something like in my mind Real make hey, you know tacos really good at this and I got to make sure the jockel under you know has Like this is the right plan and it's gonna meet every single thing that you know he wants to do so you start putting these self-imposed restrictions Instead of like Well, you're like hey man 80% solutions go real let's execute and that that's it's super liberating to think about it that way And you realize like hey, what I thought you know I've got to get this thing perfect so you know joccos like yeah, that's good I actually don't and I'm actually I'm actually failing if I'm not executing and I'm I'm sitting here trying to come up with a perfect plan Yeah, there's some report you were trying to get and You were like hey, you know, I haven't gotten you this report because I can't quite figure out this little detail at the end to make sure that it's 100% and I just I I'm just not getting it to you because I don't want it to be inaccurate and I don't want to have you like pissed and I was like Bro Actually, I'd really exact I should have I ever sweated you for the details on anything in the past 15 years I just flooded you you kind of you get you tilted you had a little bit new it Nope, and I was like why do you think I'm gonna start sweat these little like literally in Mean Meaningless a details and you're like Roger amenity at cool got it so no factor and that's that is a great example though because here I am doing about trying to put together a multi page report and you're like hey bro Just send me a just just say hey, I don't have the I don't have all the information yet Here's what I think we're doing here's kind of the general you know direction we should go and as soon as you say that I was like Just another reminder That it's self-imposed restrictions and it's it's really it can cause all kinds of problems so yeah and and obviously that means I'm doing a bad job of you know telling you what the Parameters are of success you know from like hey can you tell me what these numbers are you're like cool Yeah, but it's gonna take me three weeks to dive into all these details if I was like hey and I You know like dude I just need to know like ballpark where we at okay got it because I can give you that in 13 minutes But you know it's the it's goes back to some of that implied implied commanders intent right because the implied commanders intent is that When I ask for something I need that thing right hey You know when Jockel asked for something because he doesn't ask for much when he asked for something He must want that thing really exact the implied intent is that I want the implied intent with me is basically I want perfection right that's that's that's a complete implied intent For some reason echoes never really picked up on that implied it. No, no, that's actually not true If I think about it like the way there's been some things where I've seen I found out after the fact what you did to reach a level of As close as a human can get to perfection on something where I've been like I didn't expect him to do all that but he did it so that implied level of Perfection just from my own stupid personality is like enough to make someone tell you I better get this right before you know we go forward and that sucks and and I talked about it at Gettysburg It's like you've got to think about what you're implied What you're implied commanders intent is And if Especially if you're gonna ask him to do something that's outside that normal implied commanders intent and you know we talked about it with with Generally and some of his some of his subordinate leaders that hey generally was about kicking ass So we're moving here what's generally gonna want me to do he's gonna want me to kick ass go forward but He said hey you know don't go forward right now, but they get that word they're like the habit of generally I'm gonna go get some and they messed things up So you've got to pay attention to that implied commanders intent that just your personality has your own personality has a has a culture to it And you got to pay attention Scary that was a Some rare praise for echo Charles say we got to note that down take a Well deserved well deserved obviously Thanks Yeah, yeah I mean I'm thinking like the first time we ever went to like travel to do the podcast and You had like an eye expected I was like I had my fingers crossed my toes crossed I think I ears crossed open that you know all this quote all this equipment Showed up and we'd be able to you know we have some guests come in and it's gonna be There you know the time is valuable and all this stuff and I'm like thinking I hope this and yet you had it all you know in the Pelican case Everything was there I was like Right, you're the way okay square the way either which is not You know maybe what everyone expects maybe some people have a different implied So there you are All right Next one sergeant Henry and that's it I haven't even said this that that's where this whole manual is it's just Anicdotal one page stories where the squad leader makes a difference Sergeant Henry Hanakin US Marine Corps Haiti 1919 following serious rebel uprisings the United States began a prolonged occupation of Haiti in 1915 Charlemagne Peralta was the leader of the rebel army known as Tacos The second Marine Brigade spent several months in unsuccessful attempts to topple Charlemagne's group Henry Hanakin a sergeant in the brigade devised a bold plan to separate Charlemagne from the bulk of his troops and ambush him Sergeant Hanakin sent one of his most reliable men to become a member of the Kaco's band In a short period of time the infiltrator had earned the outlaws trust Then sergeant Hanakin had his spy feed the Kaco's location of a Marine unit that was vulnerable to attack And we'll talk about put the bait out there sends a little spy in there and says hey, there's gonna be these Marines are gonna be vulnerable to attack Hanakin spy soon returned with information of a rebel plan to attack these Marines as well as Charlemagne's Location during this attack on 31 October 1919 Sergeant Hanakin led a 22 led 22 local militiamen in an attack on Charlemagne disguised as rebels this is you know this is freaking get it disguised as rebels Hanakin and his unit move through several guard posts and boldly walked into the unsuspecting rebel camp When he was within 15 yards of you know where the story is going It's going right where you wanted to go when he was within 15 yards of Charlemagne Sergeant Hanakin drew out his pistol and shot and killed the rebel leader In the firefight that followed dude in the firefight that followed The small rating party captured the rebel position and defended it from a series of counter attacks The Marines were the target of the rebel attack had been worn by Sergeant Hanakin of the impending strike and were well prepared for the rebel attack The rebels were thoroughly defeated the morning after his act after the action Sergeant Hanakin reported his exploits to his command officer His command officer, we know what he was doing here is just out there getting after it Hanakin's actions had routed more than a thousand outlaws killed their leader in virtually shattered the entire band resistance movement in northern Haiti For his actions Sergeant Hanakin was awarded the Medal of Honor. I mean what up Talking talking about taking advantage of tent and just running with a deep deep off aggressive to the court That is like the riskiest a bunch of act of actions, right? Hey, I'm gonna set these guys over here as bait. I'm gonna sneak in there. We're gonna dress up as rebels by the way, would I get in there? I'm just gonna shoot this guy the first chance I get I wonder how do he had had he had some direction or approval from his commanding officer if that would have gotten a boot? Yeah, no that's that's too risky. Don't do it that that may have happened. You know, I every time I talk to tilt I'm like until I'm sorry if I was in charge man. I don't know if I would have improved any of your operations. I'm gonna go 24 miles into Cambodia with four other guys and we're gonna sit around and wait to get attacked by a freaking division of NVA soldiers Okay, cool. Let's do it You know as I think about that though a lot of people obviously you can be too aggressive, right? We got to be deep all the grassy but not not not too aggressive not reckless and And it sounds like they they mitigated the risk they they needed to obviously it was successful You know in that regard, but I think what a lot of leaders miss is and really we we got a lot of scrutiny on on our Pretty bold aggressive operations and and Rmadi back in in 2006 is that by being default the aggressive You can actually mitigate risk group so by by going into areas where the the enemy They were in surge in neighborhoods that no no one else could get into they had no U.S. or coalition forces presence They had no expectation we're gonna be there So we'd show up in places. They would catch them off guard. They we had the initiative. They didn't and it sounds like that's exactly what happened in that situation And I think some leaders you get to think about that look you can actually mitigate risk by being default aggressive and Something not you know you were you were all about a task get a bruiser and I think we utilized our advantage Were you in the chow hall in the in the camp marked Lee chow hall like early in the Supplement when our commanding officer was talking to me and he says you know what about all these these guys with IEDs Because I was telling that we're gonna be going on patrols and it's gonna be very dangerous And he said what are you gonna about do about these IEDs and these guys that are put 90s in the ground and I go We're gonna kill them and that was my mitigation plan Which is a very good mitigation plan get in position where you can kill those guys So you're Overwatch team sets up and you got people patrolling killed the bad guys and he was Like go kick sounds like a good plan, right and and yes, and that that's an example of How are you gonna stay safe by being aggressive? That's absolutely true. Well, just okay take the ID threat as an example Right if we're patrolling to an area where they have no expectation We're gonna be there the locals are out on the street. I mean, there's we're actually much safer for my ideas than we are If we're rolling down around rolling down the main route where they're expecting it to U.S. forces to be and that's I think that's a great example and in our CO's mind How do we do this is dangerous and and I think actually thinking it's actually less dangerous to be super aggressive and to be someplace where they have no expectation Versus them sitting back and waiting the ideas where they know we're gonna be Lessons Sergeant Hanna can displayed outstanding initiative. That's the understatement of the year and tackle proficiency Okay, maybe that's the understatement here in devising and acting upon a plan to defeat a large rebel force his plan Support of the brigade the brigades mission in Haiti sergeant Hanna can accept a great risk But to display the courage and nerve to see his plan through his bold action achieved his decisive results with a small band of men Sergeant Hanna can was able to defeat a larger rebel force by adhering to tactical fundamentals It's 22 men main effort attack the enemy center of gravity the rebel leader without leadership the rebel force quickly disintegrated Sergeant Hanna can use the elements of surprise and deception to execute his attack Surprises one of the most important tactical fundamentals and was essential to this tactical undertaking Sergeant Hanna can's actions illustrate how tactical decisions at the squad level can impact the operational Instratiic levels of war and can ultimately affect a US policy Sergeant Hanna can's attack greatly affected the balance of power and Haiti lessening the turmoil in the country It was a major step towards ending the rebellion on the island. So there you go. It's a strategic move and We always try and point out to companies that Your frontline troops can have a negative strategic impact or a positive strategic impact and it's even that's even more Accentuated in this day and age now that we have Social media and you can have one employee at one of your stores Either do something horrible and and really Damage a reputation or do something heroic and really help your reputation So do you have you in place the culture? That's going to drive those frontline people to do something heroic or have you got a culture where they're gonna be driven to do something horrible? I don't know that's on you your team The prospect of surprise is always the surest and guarantee of victory That's from Vaughan Melan thin who's a world war two general hero of the book Panzer battles which we haven't gotten to yet on the podcast We'll get there no tactical action should ever be undertaken without the element of surprise Speaking of Germans This here I already thought this book was gonna be about Marines and now we already have army marine I certainly thought it was gonna be about Americans This is about a German so the Marine Corps attitude is wide open Sergeant Wensel German army Belgium 1940 the German plan to invade France included the invasion of Belgium and Holland the French had not Defeated their border with Belgium leaving it open to attack the Belgians however Had constructed a series of forts along the canals throughout the countryside the most formidable of these was even a male Manned by 1200 Belgian soldiers the powerful guns of even a male commanded the eastern approaches to the Belgian border If this fortress was not eliminated the German army would have Significant difficulty crossing the border the Belgian border Sergeant Wensel was a member of Germany's parachute forces Must've been rad being a Paris trooper in World War II You're the cutting edge of tech. I mean what a few years earlier. It wasn't even idea that you could hawk a person out of a plane with a piece of Free pizza cloth above them and they'd live And here they are just doing assaults this one they weren't parachuteing actually on ten May 1940 his parachute company Daringly landed on the top of even a male in gliders with the mission of silencing the guns of the fortress in order to allow the German army to capture bridges to the east When Sergeant Wensel landed atop the fortress he realized his commanding officer's glider had not made it to the objective This left Sergeant Wensel in command of 80 parachutists In four man teams the Germans used flame throwers and special shaped charges to attack each gun turret Sergeant Wensel commanded his unit from a captured pill box the situation became tenuous when the Belgians prevented the German Reinforcements from arriving by blowing the bridge on the main route of the ground attack the parachute Persword caught off the Belgians were also calling artillery on the Germans and enemy infantry could be seen Preparing to counter attack the pair troopers and as I was reading a self-saclates again Enemy who we talked about there's arguing about the Belgians Sergeant Wensel Continued to lead the parachutists for three more hours as each Belgian gun position was eliminated after the sun had set Sergeant Wensel linked up with German forces from the east Even a male head fallen Sergeant Wensel's actions allowed German forces approaching from the east to advance Unmoles to across the canals when a force of 80 men he had subdued 1200 of the enemy The defense of Belgium was broken and the German army was able to rapidly defeat Belgium and move into France The northern wing of the German army rapidly outfack flanked the French army and brought about a defeat the French forces in a mere six weeks For his heroic actions and outstanding leadership as Sergeant Wensel was awarded the Knights cross When you think about 80 men beating one thousand two hundred I was sitting there and I was in my mind of thinking like how do you do that but then you I probably heard me say Don't dig in don't get in a position where you can't get out of well if you set up a fort where you're all in bunker positions And all of a sudden the enemy gets in there and they can maneuver really quickly and you're stuck in this pill box or you're stuck in this gun in placement While the other while you're bad guys the people are trying to kill you are running around and sneaking around and can get Free fields of fire because you're stuck in this box. That's that's in my mind how it happens I you do have to recognize that even a male was probably the most impregnable force fortress in the monster No, I'm freaking monster. It was like I think a 200 foot high walls along the ground. I mean, so they they probably felt like completely safe No factor. There's no way the Germans are coming But I think what's crazy and we talked about the almost surprise in that situation The Germans knew they were coming. I mean, there was an attack coming. Obviously the Germans knew they were coming They had every expo in the Belgians knew that they were coming. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The Belgians knew the Germans were coming So the Belgians they they didn't have the um the Germans did not have the element of surprise there because the they But they didn't know the manner in which the attack was coming and I think technology played a key role because I believe that might have been the first use of gliders combat ever If I remember that correctly it was certainly one of the first if not the first and so they they didn't have the expectation They they could land on top of this fortress. It was also the first use. I think of shape charges As well are that was an inventor brand new technology so they felt safe in these giant caseons of You know concrete steel and I think What an amazing victory of of just being default aggressive to the core hitting him even when they expected that the attack was coming They didn't realize the manner in which it was coming and I think they just overwhelmed them with Now they're in the fortress and we felt safe what do we do now? Yeah, and I think well the the technical I guess definition of surprise Because you know if if it in Gjitsu right you know you're going for an arm walk You know you're going for an arm walk We know you know I'm trying to tap you out right you know I'm trying to tap you out Grabbing your neck and you're you know I'm trying to grab your neck and oh my go for your on right So it's a surprise even though you know I'm trying to tap you out I'm still going to surprise you. It's like a similar thing right we know we're gonna attack but what are these weird quiet wing things coming from the sky And why are they filled with People 80 people versus 1200. It's freaking insane Lessons Sergeant Wenzel realized that it was his responsibility to complete the mission after his commanding officers Glider failed to land on the fortress How's that guy feeling afterwards? Brrr He's like so Bombed If he was still alive He worked with the existing plan to took advantage the element of surprise That is airborne landing and given him taking charge of 80 men Sergeant Wenzel showed out sending leadership Encourage as he commanded the efforts against the fortress for three hours against great out Sergeant Wenzel's understanding of the plan All out him to shoulder the burden of responsibility of leading the assault force He clearly understood his pivotal role in the invasion of Belgium and his actions fully supported his commanders intent Sergeant Wenzel's company level raid permitted a regimental river crossing which In turn allowed the German army to rapidly pour into Belgium this eventually led to the fall fall of both Belgium and France so there you go totally pivotal moment One thing I wanted to say it I don't disagree with you very often there, but Yeah, it would from a personal perspective like man, I'm so bummed that wasn't there. It was able to lead that But actually From a leadership perspective you should be absolutely stoked oh yeah that year Your frontline leaders stup stood up made things happen got the job done even without you there and obviously that's the the real testament of Of leadership that it's about the mission. It's not about you. Yeah. Yeah, no, that's the uh On a personal level of course the guy's bummed on a professional level. He's totally stoked in you obviously on a personal level You're like freaking totally stoked that your front line troops got the job done while you were uh You know while you were in some vineyard somewhere drinking wine I will say as as a couple times that I was acting tasked a commander in task in a bruiser Well, there was some huge operation going on a mustard charging button and the Albert in and you're out the battlefield I was like this is not fun. See that's what I'm not a person. I'm extremely bad. That's what I was doing Says here And this one of the quote. It is not the big armies that win battles. It is the good ones That's field marshal marise Disacts which Born in 1696 podcast one ten we covered his book He's got a weird background. He's all kinds of things He was like Polish and German and French and served in the Imperial Roman army, but he wrote that book I think it's my reveries on the war. It's a good book podcast one ten He's got the title field marshal though. It's pretty cool It's like remember we had a entaskin bruiser. We had it. We had a captain obvious and So he was kind of over the top with like the obvious comics and we promoted him to Admiral obvious And then it kind of went beyond that. I was like, what sounds even cooler bigger? So he became field marshal obvious There's only been I mean as far as I know at least in the in the US Navy there's been only been one field marshal of the obvious Which is a big promotion you know to big promotion. It's almost like a five star It's beyond as it's beyond us not quite a five star, but it's definitely you are definitely put out to be obvious stuff You don't want to be field marshal obvious Yeah, by that it's weird too because you think when you got When you caught you know Captain obvious right when you catch that nickname you're gonna start maybe paying attention Right put yourself in check when you get promoted What was the next promotion after when you get promoted to Admiral obviously like all right this is definitely got to stop I got to just just bite my lip a little bit more still done still don't quite pull it off guess what once you're field marshal Well, I think once you feel marshal own it right own it. Hey, I got a real couple obvious points to pour it out Oh Sergeant Rubar back to back German army France 1940 in the spring of 1940 the German army invaded France as the campaign Campaign progressed the 10th Panzer Division was directed across the news river and Continue to attack toward Paris the French realized That the river provided natural obstacle that could be used to hold the advancing Germans sergeant Rubarth the leader of a squad of assault engineers Which was attached to the German 69th infantry regiment the Germans were the Germans controlled the east side of the river and the French were dug in on the west The French defenses included artillery machine gun bunkers all along the river after a violent stuka era tax sergeant Rubarth squad attacked with infantry as Rubber boat reached the far shore sergeant Rubarth squad attacked the destroyed the nearest bunker on reassembling his squad sergeant Rubarth realized only two boats had successfully crossed the river Leaving only his squad and one infantry squad on the west shore to create a breach in the French defenses. How many people were supposed to go? A sultine engineers. I wonder how many boats they actually had Only two made it. Okay undontered he ordered his unit to attack another bunker with grenades and a satchel charge The French soldiers inside surrendered and their white flag was replaced with German colors This drew cheers from the Germans on the far side of the river and Demoralize the French defenders sergeant Rubarth then advance and aggressively took two more bunkers Creating a mere 300 meter gap in the first line of French defenses More German forces then followed him across the river after receiving a fresh supply of ammunition and four more men Don't worry you got four more men Proceed sergeant Rubarth continued his attack and as Enemy artillery started raining down on them sergeant Rubarth moved his squad quickly so that the artillery fire could not adjust to them His squad overtook three more bunkers and broke them through the second line of enemy positions the second line of enemy positions After seeing several of their bunkers blown up the French forces assumed that they were being overrun Their spirit crushed the French began to withdraw The action became a route as the advancing German pursued Germans pursued the French forces First achievement sergeant Rubarth received a battlefield commission to lieutenant as awarded the nighthood of the iron cross When I think now thinking to that last one in this one Let's face it you got a small number of guys and you just start going ham Just start attacking and people aren't expecting you to do that right they don't expect They see two boat show up there like oh, whatever and then all of a sudden their bunkers getting you know shaped charge on it and you're getting jacked up Do going and moving quicker than these people that are in these static positions This is maneuver warfare right. This is like the big-any maneuver warfare. I can move and you can't Just think of that think of that and then think of it from a leadership perspective think of it when you say this is what we need to do And now you've just dug into your position you can't move anywhere and my life says hey, Jockel I know that's what you want to do, but what about you know what about this over here with these other clients and I go oh We're sticking to the plan right it just doesn't work where's I'm like hey This is where I'm out right now. What do you guys think or this is where I right now? But we might have to flex that's all you need to say that's all you need to say is hey my I have an open mind That's all you need to do is have an open mind Present your idea with a with an out right Take your position, but give yourself an out. That's all you need to do So you can maneuver a little bit I think that mentality like from a defensive perspective you know I know a clouds with it's talked about the defensive position being you know the strongest and and Your mentality is like you know you're giving the all the momentum all the initiative and I think Particularly when you're in a fortress where it's even a mail or you know this these positions They probably had no expectation that someone could be inside their fortress I would totally say if you're a bit too many good to go we have the advantage and so as soon as that happens I mean that doubt starts to creep in like man You know you're you're done. They've they've lost They've lost all morale people ready surrender people ready retreat I think that's there's something about just being on the advance that gives you I don't I think all the advantage of the world Did you When I was talking about the fact that they raised the German flag and that helped them around I had a vision of a certain American flag going up and random building so with the city of Ramadi sometimes I don't know what you're talking about boss I mean that was very helpful for Brown I can see the point firm tonight that That the American flag was running up. Well, you know you talk about hate what we're going in there and you know We get approval for these missions like you know we're gonna be a sneaky sniper overwatch We don't want the bad guys in the or we are A couple times we just just had to run the old stars and stripes up in the middle of the city and say we're right here Bring it We did get a fact day bird call me on the radio Did this good deal day good deal day call me on the radio to pass the word to us in one particular Position that hey, there were some troops massing and I was like bring you know This is that that's exactly what we're hoping for mass attack bringing on Good morale for the troops. I don't know if that could have gotten it was like plausible Deniability for Jaco is tasked a commander there. We didn't exactly run that one up for Well, I guess there was some indication because well since we're putting ourselves on report here We weren't you weren't allowed to find American flag period and we did have American flag on camark we 24 seven over time Affirmative so maybe my implied commanders intent was if you got to run up the stars and stripe Did you got to run up the stars and stripes make it tall Make it tall and have a lot of machine guys And pointing at all directions what you did check Lessons sergeant who birth clearly understood the importance of rapid crossing Of the river the commanders intent at all levels from squad a division was across the river quickly in order to maintain the momentum of attack A delay at the river would have given the French time to strengthen positions close to the Paris and possibly hold the German offensive So that's a great that's a really good simple example of Commanders intent to say hey listen The commanders intent of this operation is we have to get across this river as quickly as possible and now everybody in your division knows We're gonna get across this river. That's the goal and what I'll do whatever I got into you to make that happen That's a very nice clear example of what a commander's intent is Now everybody now everybody knows what we're trying to do and if something changes And we does something I don't expect guess what cool. I'm gonna adapt and I'm gonna get across this river I'm gonna take as many of my guys with me as I can Taking on the role as the main effort of the German attack sergeant rubarth displayed outstanding leadership Shouldering the responsibility of creating a breach in the French defenses though greatly outnumbered on the far shore The squad followed their courageous and decisive leader sergeant rubarth's bravery and judgment Allowed him to succeed despite being isolated and under attack by French artillery Sergeant rubarth did not wait for reinforcements but continued to attack the enemy deciding that rapid action was necessary This is where action versus in action right action versus in action What was I saying yesterday when we were recording you have found mine I was I was like Nine times out of ten Action is better than an action. This is an example now is there a case where perhaps it would be Better to wait for reinforcements, but I'll tell you what here's the deal if you take action You know what we got enough guys what we're gonna push we're gonna go Maybe you get stopped maybe you meet heavy resistance now you know that now you know you actually can't proceed But if you go and you're like hey actually we just we just took another bunker Let's take another one you take small steps you go forward you take action and then you learn from the feedback If the feedback would have been hey, we just tried to take another bunker and we got shellacked Okay, well, we're not gonna move anymore. We're gonna wait for reinforcements. Fine. What should your default mode be? Be aggressive make it happen His actions created an opportunity which his commanders took advantage of by pouring forces through the breach And decisively defeating enemy sergeant rubarth's actions contributed directly to his battalion's crossing his divisions attacked and the eventual defeat of France five weeks later Far better it is quote far better it is to dare mighty things to win glorious triumphs even though Checkered by failure then to rank with those poor spirits who need to enjoy much more That need to enjoy much north of the feet because they live in the gray twilight that knows not victory or defeat And that's Teddy Roosevelt Metal of honor Cuba this son metal of honor you tell beach All right next up the Marine Corps brings it we got We got sergeant John Bazelone US Marine Corps Guadalcanale 1942 August 1942 The first Marine Division landed on Guadalcanale and countering stiff resistance from the Japanese defenders Sergeant John Bazelone served as a machine gun platoon sergeant supportive Company C first battalion seven parians on the night of 24 October Sergeant Bazelone's puttune occupied a key position in the battalion's offensive perimeter on a jungle ridge just past 2130 The Japanese began a ferocious attack in the dark rainy night intense fighting followed and soon the machine gun unit on Bazelone's right was overrun by screaming Japanese soldiers hurling grenades and firing rifles At the same time Bazelone's machine gun started running low on ammunition Bazelone knew that the enemy That had broken through on his right were between him and the ammunition dump But he decided that if his gun teams were not re-supplied the positions would fall Sergeant Bazelone took off his heavy mud-caked boots stripped himself of all unnecessary gear and sprinted down the trail After returning with several belts of ammunition he set out for the unmanned machine gun pits to his right knowing that those heavy weapons were vital Tools in the defense of the ridge when he got back to the gun positions He found two unoccupied machine guns jammed and ran back to get one of his own He ordered a team to follow him after Bazelone's gun crew reached their destination He immediately put them into action Bazelone lay on the ground and began repairing one of the damaged weapons once the gun was repaired and loaded He got behind the gun and began engaging targets The fight raged on and Japanese bodies began to pile up in front of the machine guns at one point sergeant Bazelone had to Direct his Marines to push back the piles of bodies to maintain clear fields of fire Several more times during the night sergeant Bazelone made trips back to the command area for desperately needed ammunition Eight separate attacks were sent Against the Marines that night and Bazelone's platoon fired over 25,000 rounds They were credited with killing an estimated 300 enemy soldiers playing a major role in Fording the Japanese attack This successful defense re-established the perimeter of the first Marine Division protected the vital airfield and led to the conquest of Guadalcanal the first island taken from the Japanese For his initiative resourcefulness and leadership in defense of the ridge sergeant Bazelone was awarded the Medal of Honor Lessons Tactically sergeant Bazelone understood his role in the defense of the ridge and the intent of the company and Battalion commanders his machine gun served a pivotal role in the company and Battalion Defense line plan He took numerous actions necessary to ensure his battalions success This included making the decision to weaken one position in order to fortify and adjacent units position to his right Sergeant Bazelone exhibited great leadership during the defense He went to great lengths to provide his unit with whatever tools were necessary to maintain the defense of the ridge His courage in braving enemy fire to deliver ammunition set an example for his Marines Unbelievable It's interesting When you think about their low on ammunition And His decision is I'm going to get I'm gonna go personally get the ammunition and I can see a couple factors playing into that Decision one of them being if we don't have ammo where all gonna die so it doesn't matter You know, I could send another guy but And I could stay here to try and help you know maintain our position But without without ammunition we're all gonna die So the number one thing we need is ammunition and these guys dealing with they're doing they got this But without bullets we're we're gonna get overrun. I am going to do this That's It's an interesting thing because you know sometimes leaders got to say okay, this is what's going on Here's the absolutely critical task and I'm actually just gonna go do it right now Because if it doesn't get done we're all doomed Taking off his boots That's a that's Hard thing for me to think about because my feet are soft Man, I think every time we turned on Barcelona road, you know up there at Camp Hamilton going on ranges and and training Just think about Think about you know the exploits of John Basel. That's that's incredible And you know, I think the other thing too to think about here is these other these other Realistations were looking at I mean obviously amazing illustrations of A junior leader, you know squad leader step up a bag in these calls, but You know the previous ones in world where wanted to you were talking about you know You look vicious fighting obviously people are dying and and and being You know shot and blown up or band added or whatever but those particular charges Bonsai charges like that and and Guadalcanal like there's zero quarter is going to be given So you're overrun and like everyone's going to get killed and and I think You know, I think that was it's a different situation, you know And I think a lot more desperation that you can't just throw up your hands and surrender like the Germans did to Disarr景 your corporate York and that particular situation Yeah, I mean I almost didn't even make it past the sentence in the dark rainy night intense fighting followed and soon The machine gun unit on basloins right was overrun by screaming Japanese soldiers hurling grenades and firing rifles Just dark and When you're in dark and Especially in a jungle like that and it's dark outside and then you shoot your gun and now you've seen the muzzle flash Like you can't you can't see anything now like it's dark it's black and And so now the only thing you're hearing is screaming Japanese They're throwing grenades which again is ruining your night vision you're seeing muzzle flashes you're shooting back at muzzle flashes Freaking just horror just horror Yeah, that's some that's some unbelievable heroism there I Think you're hitting on a good point to about prior the prioritize and execute piece and I think you know We generally would say leaders don't want to be down on the details. You want to be detached, but you know to your point if you In the prior or test and ask you'd say if I don't go do this now none of it matters We have to do that and It's the existential priority Yeah, if we don't execute this priority we will not exist anymore It's an existential decision and there's only you look and he probably looked said you know I got this guy he's working that gun he can do that There's one person that could actually make this happen right now and it's me I'll be back in seven minutes with some ammo fellas Basie Next up Sergeant Jacob Pavlov Russian army 42 the German six army was pushing into the Russian city of Stalingrad The Russian strategy was to draw the Germans into the city and fight them from building to building Sergeant Jacob Pavlov of the Soviet 13th guard division was called into his battalion map room in order to do recon a Forstory house in order to develop a company plan to attack the building that night Sergeant Pavlov Selected three men from his squad and set out on the reconnaissance So hey go into a recon to this building so that we can do a company sized 150 man assault on this building When the four-man team reached the objective Sergeant Pavlov realized that the house was occupied by only a few German defenders He decided to seize the house immediately with his small team he quickly devised a plan and within minutes had a tact and taking control of the house Using captured German machine guns and their own Tommy guns Sergeant Pavlov led his men in fighting back wave after wave of German counter attacks The next night Sergeant Pavlov sent a messenger back to his battalion by morning his group was reinforced with 16 men Three anti-type rifles two mortars and more machine guns his defensive preparations continued He directed the placement of a minefield around the building he ordered his men to take out the interior walls of the building to allow freedom A movement he posted sharp shooters and observers in the top of the building and fortified his command post at 200 yard trench was dug for Resupply when the German that's a lot of things to get done Digging a 200 yard trench Posting sharp-sharp-sharp-sharp and removing the walls inside the buildings you have better freedom of movement this guy was not playing when the German sent larger Armored forces against him Sergeant Pavlov in Improvised new tactics to fight them. This is beautiful due to the limited elevation of the German tanks Pavlov sent his machine gunners to the top floors and his anti-tank cruise to the basement from these positions His men put accurate suppressing fire on the German infantry while destroying the army of the armor So a tank gun can only go so far up and so far down and apparently they couldn't go far enough up To hit the roof where the machine gunners were and couldn't go far enough down to hit the anti-tank weapons Pavlov's house proved to be a key Russian position in the battle for style and grad The buildings height allowed Pavlov's observers to call accurate artillery fire in any direction and snipers chalked up hundreds of kills from the attic Upon finding his objective this is the lessons upon finding his objective lightly defended Sergeant Pavlov ignored his orders And used his initiative to take the house by surprise This key decision fully supported his commanders intent now. What's interesting about this is we dig in a little bit If I was sending you life to go and do a recon of a building that we're gonna attack tomorrow with 150 men I might not even cover the contingency we might not even cover the contingency of hey If there's no one in there just take it like because you're not expecting If you're expecting to need 150 people you're not expecting that four people so you might not even consider that Hey, and by the way if there's light resistance just take it because even light resistance with four guys Going into a defended Position it's gonna be hard all you need is one person with a machine gun at the end of a hallway and you got real problems So the fact that he just said I think we I think we got this Right and get it done and and and there's no radios There's no radios are not calling up and saying hey hey, hey, jockel the slave I took the building send reinforcements. No, you're just there We sent a messenger the next day for hours later after you hold station for 24 hours with four guys. That's that's crazy That's that's the power though of the commander's intent you know and understand the why and I think if you And certainly I mean the culture in the Soviet army that time was was pretty centralized You know as far as decisions to be made so I can't imagine that he got briefed for that contingency I think that that's highly unlikely so someone just to be like hey But thinking about what happens here though if he goes back You know it goes back and says hey, there's only you know it's the only lack resistance there We can attack now and maybe maybe by the time they plan their attack in 24 hours later It's a reinforced and there's 200 people there you know instead of a dozen or whatever was so that's That's pretty amazing initiative to say okay, what they actually what we want to do strategically is take this this key piece of terrain and I'm going to take it right now because there's the initiative Here's there's the opportunity in front of me and you know disease the initiative that's that's incredible Let's get it That's Lee Roy Jenkins just showed up Installing Rob Leeron Jank But I think about that though from a perspective leaders they they don't you think that you don't want your people to do that I don't want him to go too far. I don't want him to get to to aggressive. I don't want to you know You you wait for my orders and and so so there are plenty of leaders who would be upset with a Squan leader like Pavlov executing on something like that instead of actually saying that's awesome And if I had a bunch of path loves we're gonna we're gonna win this thing. Yeah, and that it's gonna make all the Devours I used to tell the task unit commanders and then I tell the whole task unit But I'd pull the task unit commander so I didn't say hey, you know, they'd be chaos going on and they wouldn't be getting anywhere They'd be bogged down they'd be getting shot up with paint ball those problems would be happening during training and I'd say imagine if Each one of your fire team leaders was doing something smart To move you where you wanted to go Imagine how easy things would be and they'd look at me like Dumbfounded because they'd know that's true like let's face it if a fire team leader goes hey We got a wounded guy. We need to move him and the boss just said we're moving south to the rally point if we all know we're moving south the rally point every Fire team can can start to make that happen and that was one of the things that would help Help move a task unit from centralized command to decentralized command just that little conversation which I had dozens of times Hey, what do you what do you think it would be if every one of your fire team leaders right now was doing something That you wanted them to do that was going that was moving them towards your goal How how do you think that would affect you right now? They'd be like it would be very helpful And I'd be like yes, it would be why don't you tell them all what that overall goal that's right now You're in a perimeter everyone's everyone's within 50 meters You could actually just yell it out right now where moving south the rally point out. Let's go. Okay Cool Maybe one fire team leader looks another fire team leader and says hey I got cover you bound back all right That's that's eight guys moving the right direction Some other fire team leader goes hey we're good. We got dead space. Let's move. Okay. That's another four guys move see if you just need to think that way You need your team to go out make things happen, but they can only do that if they know where they're going I watch you have the the other side of that equation as well You know, it's just something we talk about a lot of that's long for a lot And that's See the the recognition and these young leaders of the power leadership and whether it was a fire team leader or squad leader Machine gun or who wouldn't charge anybody else and they're standing out in the street and this told you know This mount down the urban urban you know training environment and there's paint balls flying around and explosions going off and total chaos And and that was it was so much like the leadership lab The US talk about was just an incredible thing to watch and when I was out there You know my my my last command as a senior leader to observe And my my team and being there with you as your your You're mentoring and training folks and walking up to some some machine gunners and hey What's going on right now? I don't know what's going on so what does it make a cause? What do you what do you think you do right now? We should get that building over there Why don't you make it happen? I remember I'd get the bl- this is the blank stare of like wait a second You're telling me that I could get people to go over there and they look at me kind of tilt the head And say I'm gonna get trouble if I do that I can't do that actually no one is doing anything right now I just walked by your Platoon commander and he was sitting there talking to your task unit commander about spigetti for dinner because They have no idea what's happening and if you don't make something happen no one's gonna be Anything tonight could do this over and over again Well, but you would ask the question like hey, do you think your task? Get a commander want you to be sitting out the street getting shot right now? Then they have to of course not of course They don't want their tide up with some other problem. What or their spaghetti dinner whatever it is But once you once they recognize the power of leadership and you encourage them to make that call and then I hate fall back in the building no And now all of a sudden you got you got leaders at every level that are stepping up a bacon thing's happened So so you having both of those conversations with the leaders both ends to encourage encourage their their junior folks A step up a may calls and then with the junior frontline troops that are executing and then you actually have decentralized commands It's out there making things happen It's a powerful powerful tool These centralized command sergeant back to the book sergeant path-loff showed exceptional leadership skills while defending the house He organized and led an effective defense position for over six weeks He showed tackling improvisation and skill as a combined arms leader The sergeant path-loff's actions show how one leaders actually contribute to an overall battle hits puttune sized defensive strong point Became the key position for his battalion, which in turn became the main effort of the division Pretty awesome it's better to be it's better to be on hand with ten men than to be absent with ten thousand That's from a hammer lane a Mongol emperor That would That would be a gangess con or jengess con What that Mongol emperor? No, it's not him. Is it not him? It's not him I don't even actually know if those two were related But same area of the earth. That's for damn sure and apparently I apparently both of them like kicking ass What was what was gangess con? I can't think of it. I thought it was not it. It's I got to go back and review the book I read a few or see that's you write it does begin with like a t-up's a t and they make So they made some kind of a movie about it echo. There maybe you could help out here. There's a movie about it See that's a week from neither one of us to be alive. I got a research that for sure more discipline go But I know that that's not him. All right Sergeant Forten British Army France 1944 Vital to the success. I like I said that life just pounded some Zachary. I need to remember that name Let's bring the clarity Vital the success of the 1944 Allied invasion of Europe was the capture of valuable bridges inland of the beaches This was to be done by parachute forces the night before. D day if these bridges were not taken the German army would be able to counter attack The landing forces and push the Allies into the sea just after midnight in the early morning hours of six June The fifth parachute brigade of this British six airborne division landed in Normandy one glider company was tasked with the vital mission of Seizing and holding the Pegasus bridge which crossed the Kain canal And secure the east flank of the British landing beaches if this bridge was not secured the Germans would be able to launch a flank attack into the Exposed left wing of the British invasion forces after Seizing the bridge in a daring assault the company established a defensive perimeter facing east towards an intersection at 0132 tanks of the first Panzer-Dorant engineer company with infantry support Crept toward the bridge as the lead element of a German counter attack the only this is a good story the only anti-tank weapon available to the platoon covering the approach was a small piot rocket Manned by Sergeant Thorden The pair troopers were fearful that a tank attack could not be stopped Sergeant Thornton laid lay hidden in a pile of equipment knowing the limited range of a the piot and the vulnerability of his platoon Sposition he decided to wait until the tanks were a mere 50 yards away before firing Fortuned fired the piot gun and scored a direct hit on the lead tank The round penetrated and caused a magnificent explosion Shells inside the tank began to cook off creating a fantastic light show the German company commander was mortally wounded as he tried to flee the burning Hulk The display and numerous explosions acted as a beacon for other paratroop forces lost in the dark They converged on Pegasus bridge believing that British forces had come under severe attack the second German tank immediately reversed course The lieutenant in the tank reported that the British had occupied the bridge in force and were equipped with six pound anti-tank guns The German commanders decided to wait until daylight before launching another attack as morning approach the allied force were able to land on the Normandy beaches and protect From a strong German counter attack the German delay Allowed the allies to build up combat power on the beaches and rapidly strike inland the invasion of France and the driver cross Europe led to the defeat of Germany in less than a years time So some lessons here sergeant Thornton knew that his piot gun was the only defense The paratroopers had against the German army he decided to hold his fire until the lead tank was danger close lowering the Germans into a trap This alleged yet that is that is bad. That's right there. You gotta think what's going to that guy's fire I mean just being in close proximity tanks in Iraq 50 yards away It just that noise and knowing the power of that thing and you know his guys are like dude What is it? What's he waiting for? Yeah, and you got that thought Going through your head of like the catty shack like noon and like the mess. Yeah, you got one shot To quote the great echo Charles. Oh, you could say is Dang yeah, that's a tough one wins When sergeant Thornton's round hit the tank it's at off a chain of events Which helped ensure the success of the D-Day invasion the British were able to reinforce and reconciled it in the dark The Germans decided not to risk a night attack against strong unknown forces the burning tank itself Presbyter the Germans from approaching the bridge when the British when the bridge with the bridge and British hands the pair troop company held it an entire pans arrangement at bay damn If that pans arrangement had been able to penetrate into Normandy into the Normandy beach at the ally invasion might have failed The company's pivotal position Support of the airborne divisions mission and allow the British landing forces to free Access to the beaches one shot potentially shaved the left flank of the ally invasion one shot saved the left flank of the ally invasion And there's a comment here a Tachyl success is only really decisive if it is gained at the strategically correct spot That's a volent mocha which we haven't done him yet moving gun him in the books. All right, so while I was reading that Phone of something so I was talking about the fact earlier that When we got to modern warfare when we got machine guns We started to decentralize command because now life squad is Hundred yards away from me so that way we have some dispersions that we all way we all don't get killed at the same time So that way I just got to say hey like life years are objective you got to go make it happen So now when you're talking about going in right like you're going into gliders and it's in in band of brothers When you're watching the gliders come in you're going in the dark you're hitting You're just you're just gonna be alone when you hit the ground That's what's gonna happen. You're gonna be with what you're gonna be with whatever 22 other guys That's what you're gonna be you who knows where your commander is gonna be you're freaking flying in the dark where you're jumping out of an airplane How what's your grouping how many people you're gonna be close to so That not everyone I mean they have almost no communications So what we have to do is we have to make sure that everyone understands the commanders intent everyone has to have some kind of objective So the more we got to this modern warfare the more decentralized command was and the more importance there was on commanders intent Then what happens then we start getting radios Right, so now all of a sudden Hey, life you go there I'll call you I Let you know what to do when we get there or if you get in the trouble or if it's not what you expected give me a make-coms So now I'm a son I'm allowed to de- or I'm not allowed I naturally Ease towards taking the stress off of the commanders intent because I figure just give me a call when you hit the ground if it's not what we expected So when you think about if you're gonna freaking launch gliders and paratroopers Into France for D-Day you got to expect they're gonna hit the ground. They're gonna have no idea where they are what to do They're gonna have no communications with you. They better they let me rephrase that they're gonna have No communications with you and they hit the ground They are probably not even gonna have communications with more than five or six people when they initially hit the ground maybe 10 You know maybe if it's in a glider they're all together But they're gonna be isolated So they have to understand the commanders intent otherwise it just stops right there But as soon as we get radio communications Now it's like okay, well, you know when you hit the ground Check in for the objectives or wait you know if you if you're not sure where you are give us a call and will so all of a sudden Commander's intent becomes less important and then you get to Less important if you if you could make radio come less important if you can make radio cons So then you get you fast forward, you know To Vietnam where maybe now every Platoon has a radio Right every Platoon has a radio So now well wait we at least can can control that then you can fast forward to the To the 90s like even when I first got in the teams we might not have a radio for each guy In the Platoon there might be like four guys don't get a radio Hey, make sure you stick with whatever you know because you're doing like a ship boarding and like hey if you don't got a radio Make sure you stick with somebody that does But now pretty much we don't need even know anything By the time we get to the teams in the 2000 we've all got radios all got radios so So now I can control more. Life tell me what's going to give me a status update So I can tell you what to do next and then you go To the 2010s I always said I got a blue force tracker I got a video of what we're doing and you can see where now we're becoming we're going away from decentralized command and moving closer and closer to More micro management because the technology allows me as the leader to Move those chess pieces as I see fit and It feels comfortable it feels more comfortable to do that of course. We know it's wrong Because for me to be like life give me a status up right date so I can give you you know your next move Oh, well my status it up the only eye jocco. We're getting flanked right now. What do you want me to do? Oh, I want you to oh, life just got shot Why because he didn't react quickly enough because he's sitting there waiting to be told what to do so what we're seeing now is a tendency to move More towards centralized command because we have the technology to facilitate Centralized command. I'm not saying it's right. I'm saying it's bad It's wrong, but it's that's the reason that it's happening We're starting to see more and more micro management because we have the technology of silte it's it as you're saying that I'm thinking about You know, I'm thinking about as with the training that you ran Was you know, which was the best Freaking training in the world when you were the officer charge of trained attachment You know here for the west-go seal teams and You know your instructors were were out there to teach to teach people how hard it was going to be Particularly in the urban environment, you know in a combat situation how easily you can get in blue on blue situation How easily things to go chaotic how easily you can't actually make comes on the radio You know or the lambo or firm environment exactly same thing and distances at ridge lines in the way or whatever Maybe and because it seems that way in theory You know, it seems that all in theory. We just talked everybody in the radio To be a call just radio we'll do your will decomplete. Oh, okay, and then when you realize like hey That's not gonna work if we can't make comes in you talk about shipboarding That's a great example like hey, I'm down on the engine room and there's a whole bunch of seal between me and you up in the bridge I got no comes with you whatsoever and if we're thinking that like hey I just made a call on the radio and everyone heard me and I tried to do them You taught me that and it one of the one of the biggest lessons for me You know, as we've talked about here and you know podcast you know years back is is trying to put out You know a message over the radio hey everyone do this do that and you were like use verbal commands and That was one of those things like not everyone is hearing me on the radio They're in the middle of doing stuff. There's people that are on the third story and they're talking to a bunch of walls And they're not they may not even be hearing your transmission So this illusion that I'm communicating You know is it's a total illusion because it's it's not the reality And if people don't have commanders that tend to they can't execute and there's no substitute for that at all And we see that now right in the business world as leader sent out an email or you know Hey, I told everybody what to do that they should just read their email Like hey, you're guys in the field on their email 247 there they're in the middle of doing stuff by the way they got 14 emails At six o'clock in the morning and you think that they're gonna take that one From you and be like oh, especially especially if you're the kind of leader that sends out hey just checking in with everyone Let no one knows what's going on like no no don't sign me checking emails You're gonna email I'm emailing you there's a reason for it You need to open it up and read it that means I'm not gonna email you 12 times a day I'm not even gonna email you three times a day when you get an email from me it's important If you set the presence that I'm gonna send you a bunch of stuff that doesn't matter guess what same thing with with coming up on the radio Hey, I actually need a hey anyone's got another on a home view we can push back in this reality I can't read it two more guys are just talking on the radio talking on the radio talking on the radio Eventually no one's listening to you anymore We work with the company recently where they're running a plant and the plant is being managed from a couple hundred miles away We're in like a command center and they lost power So they lose power and all of a sudden like hey they got no comms at all everything has to be done on site You know, and if you don't understand commensate the tent if you don't understand what those procedures are I mean you've got to have those contingency plans in place and I think that was what was so awesome about About seeing that at you know A trade at when you're running things is you're instilling those lessons of like okay This is why I've got to make sure that my junior leaders my squat leaders You know can step up and make calls Because if regardless of the technology that we have we're gonna fail if they can't Yeah, there would always be the the troop coming through and they'd say well I'd say well, how are you coordinate that? It would look oh it's gonna get on the radio and when it's go time I'd be like what if you don't get comms and they would kind of look at me puzzled and it get if you if you make your plan This is the this should be the fifth law of combat the fifth law of combat is if you make your plan and It's based on making community radio communications with some other element and Your plan relies on that it will not work It will not work it is going to fail you've got to have you know secondary tertiary forms of communication that Overcome the radio as you're saying that I'm thinking about the image of you standing on top of a humby at entry control point three On the far side of the canal when we had all this danger of snipers around there and and We knew that this was there was sniper activity and like no one actually picked their head above the big Haskell barriers jockels standing on top of the humbys with this tape and tenah, you know extended Delight six rate feed above is said to make comms with me You know as I was we were forward in in an overwatch position and and even then it was it was it was the recognition of like hey we We're it's gonna be really hard to talk on the radio You know and and you you did you put yourself at risk to do that, but if I didn't have commenders attend I mean I there's no way I could I could rely on that to have you make the calls for me, you know from a distant position I wanted to say one thing about this and You talked about you know the power of the flag and we talked about in that previous you know the Germans at run up the flag and French were demoralized nothing more demoralizing than a giant burning tank hole You know the the hole could that tank just just burning there that all the other skin see and That that was obviously incredibly demoralizing in this particular situation and I think when you Oh, I see what you're saying you're talking about this particular word where he hit this tank with the With the beyond yeah, he had the tank with the rocket all of a sudden, you know the tank explosion to big fireball and clearly that was a massively demoralizing thing for The German forces there which which turned it around for the breads, but I think yeah running up flags is great blowing up tanks and having a burning vehicle and for all to see like oh, I don't want that happen to me. Yeah, the reason it took me a second there It's because the times that American tanks got blown up in Ramadhi and it would take you know 24 hours to get a 88 down there to a Braggum out and that was freaking demoralizing to you know and that we we talked about the vehicle graveyard But just knowing that they're gonna get some the enemy's gonna get there And it's freaking horrible. It was incredibly demoralized to try to drive down you know route Michigan It's seen some burned out a whole come of vehicle in the side of the road But the good news was on our side. It was also very demoralizing, you know when the bad guys could observe Their their buddies land out in the street after some seals nipers put him in the dirt Yeah, and that was pretty demoralizing as well for them Which we took some pride in Chuck Next Sergeant Stephen Greg US Army Italy 1944 and August of 1944 the Allied offensive in Italy was stalemated and amphibious landing at Anzeo was executed in an attempt to outflank the German defenses and capture Rome The landing units became stalled on the beach head allow allowing the Germans to reinforce their defenses The day after the landing L company of the 143rd Infantry was moving north towards Rome the Germans were waiting in ambush and the company was quickly pinned down by enemy fire Realizing that the fire was too heavy for the medics to tend to the wounded Sergeant Greg a mortar man picked up a 30 caliber light machine gun and advanced on the enemy position His Measure to accurate bursts suppress the enemy long enough for the casualties to be evacuated Unfortunately Sergeant Greg ran out of the ammunition knows captured While Sergeant Greg's captors took cover from incoming art American artillery Sergeant Greg grabbed the machine pistol and fought his way back to friendly lines I sometimes I'm pause because I'm thinking about these things in a little bit deeper level like Picking up a 30 caliber light machine gun, which it says light machine gun a 30 caliber machine that is not light and Just advancing on the enemy position That's just awesome and then you picture this guy we start getting hit with artillery and all the captors hide and he's like oh check You little babies Watch this grabs a machine pistol fights way back from lines The next day the Germans counter attacked L company Sorry the next day the Germans counter attacked L company was ordered to hold the line on a hill capture the day before acting as a forward observer Sergeant Greg directed over 600 rounds onto the enemy until he lost communications with the mortar section Knowing how important the mortar fire was to the defense Sergeant Greg took the initiative to find out what had happened to the phone line upon nearing the mortar section Another soldier yelled at the Germans had seized the mortar position and were dropping rounds on the Americans Sergeant Greg assaulted the Germans taking two prisoners He quickly put the mortars back into the fight by gathering up a handful of American troops and teaching them how to fire mortars OJT L company held the line Sergeant Greg's bravery initiative in situational awareness contributed to his units successful defense The defeat of the German counter attack led to the allied breakout from the beach head and the eventual capture of Rome That's just a solo a lot right there. That's crazy. This solo operation Have any good check. Check out. We'll go find out what's going on with this phone wire away to second There's some Germans with our mortars cool. I'm good. What do I do? Oh, I attack them They give me a 30 30 calvarshan gun. Let's get to Yeah, Sergeant Greg displayed keen safe digital lessons sergeant Greg displayed keen situation awareness during combat at anTO while acting as a ford observer Sergeant Greg realized the importance of his units role in the company defense and did everything in his power to keep the mortars firing So This says he realized the important role like he realized what's going on. There was no one told him we better get those mortars up He realized it and made something happen when ambushed Sergeant Greg displayed the bravery and decisiveness to take action His individual attack on the Germans lifted the pressure on his unit and allowed the wounded to be evacuated Sergeant Greg's leadership abilities and strength of character allowed him to take a handful of Americans Not under his command and train them while under enemy fire Sergeant Greg's improvised section maintain the supporting fires which were so critical to the companies Defense Action Is this the common theme action if they talk about initiative that's good they talk about understanding the commanders intent but actually taking action is What we need to do In the book called extreme ownership When we talked about prioritize and execute one of the things that that I had told stoner Was you know wrote it on this thing relax look around and make a call and what's interesting about that is when I wrote that There's a part missing There's a part missing to that So when you get into a Situation where there's a lot of mayhem going on what you need to do is relax you know take a breath Look around actually observe what's happening and then make a call right make a call Now there's a part that's when you line that up with the Udalupe It almost lines up perfectly Because Observe or you decide and act we got relax which is like all right look around which is definitely observed And then make a call is decide The thing that I didn't say to Seth Was Was act and I would have said execute I would have used the word execute I didn't put that on the windshield for him the reason that I didn't put that on the windshield for him is because When you tell a seal platoon to do something Nine times out of ten it's gonna get executed when someone says Online get the word gets past they get online when someone says peel right they get all mine They peel right when someone says strong right strong left when somebody makes a call it gets executed And his platoon was executing stuff He was him that needed to make a call so That's that's the piece that I didn't tell Seth because I didn't need to because it wasn't him that was gonna use gonna make the call His platoon was gonna execute and and believe me they did you know when when he would make a call or when someone would make a call They'd execute that's pretty normal. It's very normal for a seal platoon. It's very seldom that a seal platoon when they get Do when they get told the excuse something that they don't do it if you make a call jp to nls executed People are yeah, you picture you got 16 jp to nls or even if you got five jp to nls and some other guys Shit's gonna happen. It's gonna happen So when I wrote that for Seth it was about him and the execute part I didn't have to say anything because I knew if he made a call it was gonna happen That's a that's a big assumption For a lot of for it's a big assumption for us as individuals and it's a big assumption in a normal team right Look, I knew Delta platoon at that time and like I said most seal platoons quite frankly they will execute as we just said But that's not always commented and It's something that You should we should actually add if you're gonna say hey if when there's things happening relax look around and make a call The next thing should be execute Because there's people that make calls there's people that make calls and businesses There's people that make calls and dynamic situations they make a call But if you haven't trained and Been been for lack of a better word programed that when you hear a call you're gonna execute There's often times when the execution doesn't happen The reason I'm bringing this up is because I was thinking about this because the every one of these things the common thing is that somebody's taking action It's not someone's making a decision they're making a decision too, but they have to act and even when Dave talks about the Udalupe You know, he He says that the most important part of the Udalupe is action It's action you've got it you've got to take action if you don't take action look you can or observe oriented decide all day long If you don't act It doesn't matter and same thing with relax look around and make a call hey You can relax and orient yourself and observe what's happening and make a call But if nobody executes that call you're dead in the water So these things are all about actually taking action It's a great observation because that's that's the breakdown for a lot of leaders and we see that all the time You know it with a decision gets made and we're working with a company and you know They've got a problem performer and they don't everything they can't train to mentor them and they okay We're gonna have to actually make this decision to to let them go And then you come back and talk them six weeks later and the decision got made But they never executed and the performer still there and then it takes six months or nine months to get that done and it's so much Harker to do then and all the damage has been done and I think that's a great observation to me because it's a You know you can make a decision but if you're not actually executing it and it doesn't it gives you You're setting yourself back you're losing initiative You're wasting you know momentum you're giving your competition A leg up and you know to your point earlier like nine times at a ten action is the best thing Yeah, take action taking it over step the direction you need to know you need to go And it just gives you all the advantage of the world yeah occasionally you could get a pull-toon where They're not you know they don't have that They don't have that attitude Where they're like okay the call's got made and we're gonna go make this happen Occasion you would get a pull-toon like that and then it then it would be Hey, would you hear that call you got it you got to go get on that you got to make that happen you got it you got to execute Like I said don't soon didn't need that they just needed set to Freaking relax look around and make a call once the call is getting made do the head experience guys And they're like you said you got some you got some JP details and some other freaking guys They're gonna make things happen in there. It's it's no factor Action Next one corporate David W. Lamb US Army Korea 1951 in October 1951 G company 23rd Infantry Regiment was battling for hail 520 of heartbreak rich The company had been withered by repeated fights with the North Korean forces Corporal Lamb was acting platoon commander of the third-button of a unit of about 20 soldiers so we got the That freaking e4 out there acting as a platoon commander Following heavy bombardment and supporting fires corporate Lamb's platoon made a direct assault on hail 520 Upon nearing the enemy Lamb's platoon was halted by enemy fire and began taking casualties Lamb called back for reinforcements lieutenant Gano Gathered his first platoon and moved towards Lamb's position Gano's platoon began to take casualties and halted when the young lieutenant was killed Private high stepped into the role of platoon commander and rallied his platoon While under fire corporate Lamb directed the use of supporting fires and planned a new route for the enemy attack for the company attack After a bitter fight that two platoons breached the enemy defenses during the assault on the position Corporal Lamb was wounded private high was now the main effort of the attack He directed the remaining soldiers in taking out the bunkers in the enemy defenses using grenades and Flame thrillers Three hours after the attack had set off the enemy position was secured corporate Lamb's leadership had pulled its platoon and the remainder of G company forward through the withering fire in the enemy's position the attack pushed the enemy off Hill 520 and important and important step in removing resistance from heartbreak rich you know it's interesting I'll a lot of times tell leaders you know you should have if you got Seven or eight direct reports you should have two or three of those direct reports that are ready to step up and and take your job And and here you got a private you know this guy is this guy is a freaking private And he takes charge and makes things happen that's next level right hey it should be imagine me saying hey look You got your direct reports and all your direct reports your eight direct reports. You should have two people that are ready to take your job and In their direct reports there should be five people that are ready to take your job That's impressive And if you if you made that your goal that the people Not just your subordinates there subordinates there was people that were there there were two levels below you in the chain of plan That we're gonna step up and take your job if it need be imagine how effective and efficient those Individuals would be Freakin awesome Like you talk about all the time like every leader should be trying to work themselves out of a job And I think it's so hard to do that because our ego is getting involved and like why I want to be the one that makes calls You know, but you you insisted on that. I know you'd learn that from from Delta Charlie and and your time in the the seal teams and Putting like Ryan Ryan jobes our most junior ranking guy as as a an E3 and we put him in charge of running an entire assault like planning and Exkeying that assault and you know, he did get it. It was it made him so much of a greater contributor because he understood You know the the He understood the challenge of leadership he understood how he could best support You know the overall team and then what kind of information we needed to make decisions and I would have never done that without your encouragement And in fact, I think I pushed back on a little bit You know like he wanted want to let who's your most And want you let want you let bickles run this and I was like I'm sure about that. I like he said he's brand new and you're like yeah, just let him on it Yeah, see what he does it to find you know and that's the crazy thing right there right is like he'll do fine And he'll be fine. Yeah, yeah, totally fine. Yeah, he'll do fine. He'll do fine. He'll do fine It's like even when we run FTX is like the FTX trading program for civilians What I don't know how we had this Talk or when it was but the overall the overall The overall meaning of the talk was was like that'd be fine like these civilians that got 45 minutes of training of how to assault the building they're actually gonna do fine. It won't be that big of a deal look Is a seal puttune Better trained yes, but I'm saying the general idea of what they're doing is gonna be fine. It's gonna be enough to work with and And so someone like Bagel's who is like in the platoon and it's going through the workup and understands things It's like he he he watch this. He'll do it. I'll do it fine and you know he'll make the same They'll make you just did it life babbin the platoon commander from the naval academy, you know You just did it and you made Four mistakes and Biggles is about to do it and he's gonna make five it's not like Life just did it and he made one mistake and Biggles is gonna do it. He's gonna make 80 no, it's like It's like seven mistakes and he made three that's It's like that crazy and and the the thing that you mentioned about How much more it opens up somebody's brain When they get to see Like all that when you're in charge of on this exactly you can be called it does it with Delta Charlie did does Put you hear your in charge this you're running this and all of a sudden instead of me looking at this little tiny sliver of the plan And the sliver of the execution I'm looking at this whole big thing and so I see so much more See how things are interconnected that was such a powerful Love am I gonna use this work. Yes, I am life changing life changing for me to have the vision and to have my boss say you're gonna run this and get to run it and see all these things that I'd never seen before And be like and then the next mission by the way I'm back to just being a radio man But I can see all the connections. I know the importance of job. I know that I my I know that this would help my boss I know that this would help the other the other squad leader. I know that I should talk to this guy about Just makes you infinitely better That was a really powerful lesson that that I learned from you and and saw the impact and I think that If leaders can just simply put their ego in check and realize just to your point and you had with those Seal button commanders and task and a winner think if you had think if you had 16 or 40 of those guys out there Who can see that vision or thinking about not just their task, but everything how can they can help the overall mission and the attempt of the purpose that you're out here You know trying to accomplish it's just absolutely life change and game changing and that that team is just They just dominate. There's no there's no stopping that team there. They just crush everything Some lessons Corporal lamb displayed tremendous leadership abilities his fellow soldiers benefited from his competence When he assumed command of the platoon and led a company sized attack when the time came for him to command at a higher level He was able to shoulder the responsibility Tactically proficient corporate lamb had learned the necessary skills for commanding a platoon in combat Check he was able to coordinate supporting fires with his company commander Direct actions direct the actions of other platoons and inspire the men under his command by his personal leadership His knowledge and ability met with the success on the battlefield By the way, I got a I got a text from a tilt the other day And it was after he listened to a podcast with With Dave Burke good deal. Yes good deal Dave. Good deal Dave was telling You know talking about calling for bombs calling fire calling for fire in Remadi and I don't know the number of times that that Dave was on the ground to drop bombs, but you know it was a lot Yeah, it was a lot And then tilt listen to it I don't was like hey really like listen to your your podcast with Burke Let him know that I got to call some fire to only I was an E4 when I did it and and and it is You could not You could not compare the amount of times that Dave Burke had dropped bombs In his entire career including training You could not compare that amount with the amount that tilt dropped on one operation one Operation where he's sitting at night for 12 hours with continual close air support Till we'll make you feel like a baby Yeah, I don't think you're I don't think you're measure enough to I don't think you measure enough to that in any shape way shape before but look that's you know We talk about humility and I think that's anytime I think I've done something or we saw some combat You know and you start reading books. I mean every single one of these of these Illustrations here. I mean it just just blows away and anything that I saw I did it's incredible I will say this though and talk to I did I talk to you know a couple of Vietnam seals that are outstanding You know folks and had some awesome experience and it served as seal machine gunners in Vietnam And they talked about being in some gun fights and I mean these guys I mean amazing you know Incredible people who had awesome experiences are four fathers that created this legacy You know for us in the seal teams and when you're talking about a machine seal machine gunners You know and how many it was really cool to see our belt film machine getters take campus alive and how awesome they were and And we were talking about like how often you know I so I asked I asked so one of them good friend of mine How many times you have to reload your machine gun? He's like oh man maybe a couple times I was like well how many I mean you I mean you must have shot your whole load out a few times you know Much of times he's like Not all the guy ever shot my whole load up and I was thinking like dude. I still was I was just saying I'm gonna shot the entire 600 round load out and then maybe four or five hundred more rounds there But he also is carrying like all the time on so many of those operations. Yeah, the I had the same Conversation with with what I had this exact same conversation with one You know badass four father Vietnam seal who is a machine gunner in nom and He said the same thing you know he was like I think he said he's like yeah, we got in six fire fights, but that's what I also learned is that Much like current seal deployments you could have one seal deployment in Vietnam where you go to a certain A.o. and the enemies act in a certain way and it's freaking like daily Craziness and they were doing what they oh, yeah, they do since they would do squad operations So they go every other night your squad my squad your squad my squad and they would do operations all the time so it is also You know based on the particular a.o that you know that you were in I mean even when we were when we were in Ramadi the guys that were over in another city You know whatever not not that far away Some of those guys didn't didn't I don't know if they got in fire fights, so I mean they got you know two or three So it's one of those things where I hate to use this word by gotta get a lucky way your a.o You know and then of course you gotta make your own luck Next up sergeant Steven Bouchard US Marine Corps Vietnam 1967 in July of 1967 first Battalion ninth Marines took part in Operation Buffalo designed to defend the border between north and south Vietnam known as the D milleterized zone during this operation of Italian was ambushed by an entire North Vietnamese army Regiment and took very heavy casualties the first and second Battalion's third Marines were sent to rescue One-nine and stabilize the area sergeant Bouchard served as the right guide for second Battoon A company One-three the platoon's mission was to clear the area where one nine had left their dead As a company moved out of its positions Second Battoon came under heavy shell fire the platoon commander was wounded and had to be met In fact the platoon sergeant took command the NVA began firing from bunkers in the far tree line The platoon sergeant froze with fear leaving the platoon without leadership Sergeant Bouchard unhesitatingly took command of the platoon and played an important role in the company's subsequent actions Sergeant Bouchard's strong leadership pulled the platoon through the horrible task of retrieving the corpses of one nine While under enemy fire while manning a defensive position a breach in the Battalion line was created between Bouchard's platoon and the adjacent B company Bouchard's platoon counterattack into the breach and sealed off the NVA who had infiltrated the perimeter His unit then made contact with approaching forces wearing Marine gear Sergeant Bouchard ordered his Marines to hold their fire until the figures had come into Within hand grenade range at that time Bouchard decided to open fire on the approaching soldiers who were NVA wearing stolen gear from the dead of the one nine Bouchard's tactical actions broke the enemy attack and the Marines went on the offensive Sergeant Bouchard remained in command of second platoon until the unit was ordered to pull out a One three was the last unit to leave the battlefield before B52 strikes leveled the area Sergeant Bouchard was both willing and able to take responsibility of leading the platoon His tactical skills allowed the platoon to play a major role in the company's combat operation Sergeant Bouchard was able to take charge by being decisive We recorded a whole thing yesterday on for EF online on being decisive The squad leaders did not respond to the platoon sergeant who was too fearful to lead Sergeant Bouchard took decisive action and was not afraid to make tough decisions and carry out difficult tasks And once again, what do you do? You took action Take taking action His decision to open fire on the individuals in Marine uniforms required decisiveness and acceptance of Responsibility Sergeant Bouchard led his platoon by example many Marines were devastated by the sight of the Marine dead left behind by one nine Sergeant Bouchard's capable and firm leadership held Second platoon together and that right there. I mean this is just devastating you know you know we talked about How how much it hurt to see an American tank burning in in the streets in Ramadi I mean can you imagine your platoon is now out there just recovering body after body after body of your fellow Marines? I mean it's a it's a nightmare and and obviously they didn't go into it too much And I all have to do some research and if I can find any more information about this but You know they clearly mentioned it here many Marines were devastated by the sight of the Marine dead left behind by one nine Realizing that his unit had to be at the right place at the right time in order to make a different Sergeant Bouchard led a counter attack to plug the gap in the lines between A and B companies This platoon level tactical action secured the company flank and prevented the battalion from being split and overrun And There's a quote here from the German army that says it's better to have a good sergeant in command than a bad officer We'll take that one. That's that's a great quote right there Corporal Lester A Tully US Marine Corps Vietnam 1968 the 1968 Ted offensive took American forces in Vietnam by surprise Way city the ancient Imperial capital of Vietnam was quickly overrun by the North Vietnamese army The NBA Given the mission of relieving the first Arvin division command post to G company second battalion fifth Marines advanced on foot through the city The first Arvin division Cp was located at the northern corner of the Citadel A historic fortress G companies rude of advance would take them right through the Citadel The company advanced along highway one with second platoon in the lead until it became necessary to cross a bridge over the perfume river Just as the lead squad crested the center of the span An NVA machine gun in place to name fortified bunker open fire the company was pinned on the bridge and the lead squad took multiple casualties An M60 was set up to counter the NVA position, but the team leader was killed moments later as sparked flew from enemy rounds hitting the bridge structure Corporal Tully decided to take matters into his own hands Corporal Tully was second squad leader of second platoon On the bridge his squad was located directly behind the lead squad Assessing the situation corporal Tully decided upon a course of action that would allow his company to advance Realizing that his squad was protected from fire and Was the nearest to the enemy corporal Tully charged up a walkway and threw a grenade into the enemy position killing five NVA and Silencing the position the company followed corporal Tully squad Cross the bridge and advanced upon the citadel as the company neared the citadel It met heavy resistance from northern Vietnamese army regulars while forced to withdraw Gulf two-fied Gulf two-fied clarify the situation around the citadel American commanders had gained a much needed clear picture of how strong the enemy was in a way city Now the American commanders could concentrate on what to do rather than wondering what was going on That's a you know, we used to set up the the old barricade attutor down the hallway This is just an awful one a barricade attutor down the bridge And what are you gonna do you got down to men on that bridge because you think oh, well, I'll just jump off the bridge It would be okay. What about your wounded friends up there? So you can't just abandon it. It's a nightmare What's up with the what's up with a grenade killing five NVA? That's a that must have been a That's a tight shot. They must have been closely grouped. I mean like way tightly grouped That's a well well thrown grenade I always love that that that you know the I guess Yeah, the American grenades being like baseball's Baseball side and the Germans they couldn't they couldn't hang Because they play soccer and so they you know the potato match of grenades echoed Charles You know you ever seen a of a grenade with like a long stick on one end of it Yeah, like on red don't yeah, so that's called a potato matcher because it looks like something you know But the reason that it was created was you can use it like with leverage to throw further Yeah, because you can't kick a grenade like it's a soccer ball So they couldn't throw like a merit you take an American kid man come on He's gonna take that little baseball size creating it's hooked that thing strike He's gonna put it into a machine gun pick go five people Accuracy freaking awesome. Yeah, if you remember from from easy company that with with the The two five oh six the band of band of brothers if you see the the tell me she'll read the book But remember buck Compton was a all American catcher for UCLA's baseball team He was apparently direct line drive hitting German soldiers with with him That's so freaking after That's so epic. I was uh when I was going through STT like the what became S QT So you know the get done with basic skill training and the issue up with a team and then they put you through training and That we we went to a grenade course, which was just run by team guys But we were throwing pineapple grenades Straight up pineapple grenades the crates were marked 1947 What's the pineapple grenade like that your dish looking grenade? It sort of looks like a pineapple It's got the little like spikes spikes on it's like like a like a like a like a quad pattern Oh, yeah, it's just like a stereo typical grenade. Oh, yeah, like okay What you look like if someone's gonna get a tattoo of a grenade, right? That's what they get okay So the and then what then the kind of modern grenades? That's just the round just yeah It just looks round but that that those pineapple grenades so we go up there and This is just dumb team guys stuff So we start throwing these grenades and like a bunch of them are not working because they're whatever at that time Like 50 years old or something crazy like that. It's where Huck in these grenades and The chief that was running the training who it was a freaking like a bad ass team guy I'm at a fact Tony mentioned him because he he died But the same as Tim Feral and so we're throwing these grenades and when they would so if if you threw a grenade It didn't go off the protocol was shut down the range call EOD EOD can come out there whatever in five hours and you're gonna sit there for five hours waiting for them to show up So Tim Feral didn't want us to miss training so he's going out on the range He'd like be like he'd give it like whatever a few minutes and then he'd take another grenade another freaking Old rusty pineapple grenade He would go up pull the pin said it down next to the one that was the dud after he went around the report That's balls he said it down and then run back I jump into the pit and did I'm a new guy? I'm like Dandy this dude's a bad guy. It's like this guy's crazy But that's you know that's how if you out there running hand grenade range is do not do not do they do not do that Do not do that not advisable like I said dumb team guy stuff Freaking don't real dumb those those pineapple grenades So that you know the M67 which is the moderate rout grenades were used that It the frag pattern is so much the the scrap frag is tiny it breaks up into those little little small piece Where the pineapple guys got the big old chunks and that's what the That's what the the Insurgents had in reminding yeah cover all those Oh, yeah, they have those They have those Russian ones that are more cylindrical. They're cylindrical and they still have the grid pattern on them You'll hear cover to bunch of those out of that that one moss that we cleared within Iraqi soldiers Imagine that You get so much So you don't use the pineapple grenades at all no long time no dang that's kind of the iconic Look, yeah, that's what I'm saying if you're gonna get a tattoo of a grenade You're gonna get that one most like I've never seen anyone of the M67 grenade tattoo review Yeah, cuz it's kind of round right it doesn't quite have the kind of boring. Yeah, I was looking Unless you're hooking it You're kind of pumped I'm okay. I remember some of those son of those pineapple the Russian pineapple grades Those things were heavy That was true I'll tell them more on the film for sure It seemed like most well like you said the frag was a heavier You know like just that just the metal was heavy. I don't know what they're explosive weight was off top of my head They're definitely bigger They make a big boom. I can tell you that so there's different sizes of grenades or no Yes, they're all like so well you mentioned that the grenade killed however many guys in one shot That was more a statement of like that must have been a hell of a shot and the guys must have been close together Because a grenade is a very small explosive. I mean, it's a small five five meter kill range Yeah, so it's yeah, if they're all cruising together boom There's a no-for-acco Charles though that the movie master the so that the five meter kill radius for M67 are our Our hang grenade a frag grenades the same it's the same kill radius for a golden egg Which is a 40 millimeter grenade that you shoot out of your your M203 grenade launcher are the old school M79 that we we carried and Unlike what you might see in the movie commando when when you when you shoot a 40 millimeter grenade The building doesn't blow up and we had several times where it just it fragged people and they run off It's a common this disappointing. No, that's a common misconception that actually is true in commando is actually factually the proof that it Well, I'll get a say is I tried that many times and as an officer, you know my job is to stand back and and High point my weapon and be detached But that also means that if I'm in the back, I can shoot some 40 millimeter nades and we we've shot quite a few of those things Which is awesome. I remember you often coming back with a empty band leaders So wait on predator no no no, they started totally it started Remember the the scene on predator just even to a plane and get a blame since I don't I don't have time to bleed right remember that part Yep, okay, you bleed and then like I ponds Jose, okay, do you have time to duck exactly? He came out shot is that the 40 millimeter? That's a 40 meter. Yeah, I had a M203. So he's launching that into the Unlight like look it would definitely keep guys heads down and if we did have we had a couple guys that discord score some direct hits with a 40 millimeter Which is if you take one of those in the chest. It's game over for you That was pretty epic, but But there there is what what doesn't happen is like you saw a predator where you launched a 40 millimeter 40 40 mic mic into a bunker and like a giant explosion happens and six guys go flying I'm picking the air and all directions that doesn't happen. That was pretty disappointed Did you see my Instagram post where is that hey people are parking in front of my driveway and then I shoot the cars? Yes Is that a 40 millimeter? I mean I guess I thought you had a rocket. What about a rocket? I was like one you know the big I Think like six of them fit in there. Oh, you know what you did have you had the street sweeper There's a street sweeper 40 millimeter, which the Marines had The right Marines had some and they're heavy, but it's pretty awesome It's just a cylinder and so yeah, you can just launch a whole bunch of yeah, it's basically like a gigantic revolver It with 40 millimeter That wasn't real it was real, but I don't look at the tag The what he called the instructions or whatever the name I did shoot some vehicles with 40 mic mic It does create quite an explosion and if you can ignite the gas You know then it will catch on fire there was an a gigantic explosion that happened That was a little disappointing. You're that you got to go in good deal day for the bombs There's just not that much explosive inside I mean you'll like how big an Amadeus, yeah, I mean think of how big an Amadeus, well, then think of how big a greatest I mean I can just kind of multiply that and You're gonna get something similar. So do you remember that they gave us the thermo barric 40 mic mics? I do remember that which which create a much larger explosion and supposed to kill people with the overpressure and they gave us a bunch of like couple Several cases of them and that was supposed to last the entire deployment and We shot every single one of them on one operation within about a one hour period Which was awesome that was awesome, but what was also additionally awesome was I got an email follow up and The fuck they said He said something like Hey, we're wondering if you've had a chance to utilize the because they were they were testing them We're wondering if they've had a chance to if you've had a chance to use any of these thermo barric or need 40 millimeter grenades And have you had a chance to fire any of them yet and I was like I was like hey life Have you you shot some of those hours? I was shot all of them I know how were they like they were awesome and I just wrote back Worked good send more I think I think I asked for more of them The only thing that was different is that they they were much heavier because they're a lot larger and they're exposed And as much much more powerful so little closer to what you might expect But you got a count for that in the trajectory because You're dope in it yet. What are you aiming at is they're falling like you know 50 meter sure? Yeah, that's kind of hard to dope in on me can't mark me It's roll out dope in your 40 my like that's crazy All right the lessons from that one corporal Tully New the mission of the company was to relieve the first Arab and division headquarters When the company was halted by fire he took decisive action in support of the commanders intent to free up the movement of the company So the mission could be continued Corporal call he acted corporal Tully acted on his own initiative Being the second in the company formation He was in the best position to evaluate the situation and take advantage of the opportunity Developed by the point squad So what we have here again we've got somebody that's in a position They're not the leader This isn't the gunnery sergeant. This isn't the platoon commander. This isn't the company commander This is the squad leader Who takes action and Makes a difference and Look we we saw this kind of thing all the time and we were lucky enough to work alongside the army work alongside the Marine Corps and see You know not just from our own pltunes not just from Charlie and Delta Tunes see our The young he fives and step up and make things happen. We got to see things like this we get to see things like this all the time all the time You gotta you gotta think about how young these guys any experience these squad leaders are as well too And then I was you know as we're reading here in those stories I'm thinking about a Young squad leader that we worked with from three eight Marines Lima company named Joe Tomsey Corporal Joe Tomsey and we did probably it doesn't operations with Corporal Tomsey and his squad And we learned a lot from those guys. I mean they had been in Ramadi for several months prior to us and it fought through some of the most difficult dangers neighborhoods And he was he was 21 years old So here's areas in charge of a squad of Marines leading those Marines of beloved squad leader Stepping up and making calls supporting the chain of command You know and just just executing again things done and I Had so much respect and you know to build a work with with a Marine like that and and Tragedically Corporal Tomsey was killed on August 2nd 2006 the same day that we lost Mark Lee same day Ryan Joe was shot and blinded and We we lined up next to those Marines from three eight Lima company And we put both Joe Tomsey and Mark Lee on that angel flight the same time and I remember the silence of Of all the Marines next to us as as our seals from Charlotte with two carrying those That our brothers in body back to putting them on that angel flight as they took off and just the The glow of that of that helicopter going going going around as they took off the fly those guys out and What a loss. I mean just seeing how crushed those Marines were losing their brother and this bull of squad leader And I was just thinking about us as we're hearing those stories It's hard to imagine that these guys how young they were you know a guy like Corporal Tomsey 21 years old It with all that you know, we just limited life experience and yet in this massive position of responsibility They're playing such key roles and in in women other teams succeed to fails and just my hats off all the squad leaders out there and What are not going to work with the guy like that and to reflect on on the impact that he had on all the Marines that he'd be led Yeah, that was um I think that's probably a pretty good place to stop for today We got some more we got some more things to cover and It's important to remember that these guys You know the guys that we're talking about in this book when you're talking about Corporal Tomsey when you're talking about Mark You know, we talk about now they make a difference on the battlefield and make a strategic impact, but Their actions and the way they lived in the example that they sent definitely have made a difference in the way that I think in the way that you think and The impact that they had not just on the battlefield, but To see an example to be examples of what a leader is and More important what a person can be And Like I said, well, we'll pick this up on the on the next one but From from these stories that we heard already You know, I get referring back to taking action and and These these squad leaders they take action and they and they make a difference And And that applies to us as individuals our actions Make a difference our actions that we take as people make a difference not just on the battlefield not just in business But in life So Step up take action and make a difference All right echo Charles It's been a while, but I need some help over here. Yes, sir. I want you to talk for a little bit All right, well, I didn't talk about taking action, which I agree with obviously Well, we're gonna start small about that as far as taking action goes so the best action that we can take To improve is to improve our physical Starts there this is this is essentially the foundation for Pretty much all other action when you think about it. Okay, I was feeling like obviously I was getting a little bit emotional there. I'm done now. You can stop talking Okay, we're trying to cool down. I think I'm cool. We're good. Good. What I was gonna say is we got to start small Okay, we're not all we're not all dressing up like rebels, you know with our friends going in and shooting the rebel We're not all doing that. Okay, okay, sure. That was epic. That was most of us are just kind of you know Just going day to day with her, you know with our lives and Tactically and strategically trying to do the right thing all right Starting small best way to take action or the best thing to do Is to maintain or improve our physical Well, let's just say it's a great place. That's a great. It's a great place to start. Yes, we like it. Yes, sir. Can't argue. No can't so Improving physical health takes What I used to call beat down to get a beat down your body a little bit varying levels of beat-dumps We all worked out today a Affirmative some of us plan to work Oh, did you not want to go out to the world right now yet? I'm working on later. So I'm saying He was he was saying I echo echo was called me out earlier for not throwing around the hundo The hundo kettlebells life you're in a good amount for two days. Would you be more consistent if you work with your work out? If you lived in San Diego with me or like near me hundred percent Yeah, check.
