00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000 This is Jocco podcast number two, 96 with me, Jocco Willink.
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.72 The Chief of Naval Operations takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Special
00:00:12.72 --> 00:00:20.04 Warfare Operator First Class, Chad M. Wilkinson, United States Navy.
00:00:20.04 --> 00:00:28.48 For service as set forth in the following citation, for conspicuous gallantry and
00:00:28.48 --> 00:00:34.08 intrapetity in action against the enemy while serving as a mission support sight team leader
00:00:34.08 --> 00:00:41.56 while assigned to a joint task force in support of operations in during the freedom on 24 April
00:00:41.56 --> 00:00:43.72 2011.
00:00:43.72 --> 00:00:50.64 The officer Wilkinson displayed superior guidance during a daytime assault targeting a Taliban
00:00:50.64 --> 00:00:56.52 commander while under significant enemy fire.
00:00:56.52 --> 00:01:01.88 Upon arriving into the objective area, Petty Officer Wilkinson and his assault element came
00:01:01.88 --> 00:01:06.12 under a hail of enemy fire.
00:01:06.12 --> 00:01:13.08 He and his teammates led his assault to set containment on the objective area.
00:01:13.08 --> 00:01:17.88 After receiving friendly wounded in action from direct enemy fires and grenades within 20
00:01:17.88 --> 00:01:24.36 meters of the target compound, Petty Officer Wilkinson boldly exposed himself to the enemy
00:01:24.36 --> 00:01:28.92 and suppressed the incoming fire that allowed his element to move to safety and enable
00:01:28.92 --> 00:01:37.32 the combat medic to move to their positions to treat a head wound of one of his teammates.
00:01:37.32 --> 00:01:42.24 He directed two additional assaults on the target compound and coordinated with higher
00:01:42.24 --> 00:01:48.76 headquarters for three rotary wing, close air support missions after evacuating all non-combatants
00:01:48.76 --> 00:01:53.000 from adjacent buildings.
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.20 Petty Officer Wilkinson's actions eliminated the enemy combatants, enabled the evacuation
00:01:58.20 --> 00:02:06.72 of the wounded casualties and allowed for the safe extraction of the assault force.
00:02:06.72 --> 00:02:13.56 By his bold leadership courageous actions and total dedication to duty, Petty Officer Wilkinson
00:02:13.56 --> 00:02:19.28 reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the United States
00:02:19.28 --> 00:02:31.32 Naval Service for the President Jonathan W. Greenert Admiral United States Navy chief of
00:02:31.32 --> 00:02:38.84 naval operations.
00:02:38.84 --> 00:02:52.52 So there you have the award citation of a hero from one of our recent wars.
00:02:52.52 --> 00:02:55.80 Afghanistan.
00:02:55.80 --> 00:03:02.80 And war is in some ways timeless.
00:03:02.80 --> 00:03:16.48 There are heroes, there are sacrifices, and there's fear and pain and loss.
00:03:16.48 --> 00:03:24.92 And war also evolves over time and there's new weapons, new technology, new tactics,
00:03:24.92 --> 00:03:35.16 there's lessons that are learned, there's solutions that are created with the advent of
00:03:35.16 --> 00:03:36.16 poison gas.
00:03:36.16 --> 00:03:41.84 World War I came the advent of the gas mask.
00:03:41.84 --> 00:03:48.64 From the creation of machine guns came the creation of the tank.
00:03:48.64 --> 00:03:56.48 Was responsible for the creation or the advancement of radios and radar and atomic weapons
00:03:56.48 --> 00:04:03.92 and energy and jet engines and electric computers and war creates problems.
00:04:03.92 --> 00:04:10.28 I think create solutions to those problems.
00:04:10.28 --> 00:04:18.20 Or at least it's supposed to.
00:04:18.20 --> 00:04:25.60 There've been great advances in medicine from war.
00:04:25.60 --> 00:04:34.16 The Civil War in America brought about the significant use of anesthesia.
00:04:34.16 --> 00:04:40.52 The World War I men were now being gravely wounded by these newly developed machine guns
00:04:40.52 --> 00:04:42.92 and they were losing massive quantities of blood.
00:04:42.92 --> 00:04:49.60 And so doctors started regularly using blood transfusions for the first time.
00:04:49.60 --> 00:04:59.48 World War II saw the expanded use of antibiotics to fight off infections.
00:04:59.48 --> 00:05:05.56 World War II's also where they started using metal plates to repair broken bones and fractures
00:05:05.56 --> 00:05:08.88 from these explosions, from these new weapons.
00:05:08.88 --> 00:05:14.28 And the Korean War helped advance the idea of life flights.
00:05:14.28 --> 00:05:18.96 Then using helicopters to get wounded soldiers the care that they needed is quickly
00:05:18.96 --> 00:05:24.92 as possible.
00:05:24.92 --> 00:05:32.96 And the Vietnam War started using Nae Palm regularly.
00:05:32.96 --> 00:05:36.76 Not brought about advances in burn care.
00:05:36.76 --> 00:05:45.60 And they started using antiseptic and antibiotic infused the dressings to reduce infection.
00:05:45.60 --> 00:06:02.80 So war creates new forms of physical trauma and then creates ways to help ease that trauma.
00:06:02.80 --> 00:06:07.12 And then there's unseen trauma.
00:06:07.12 --> 00:06:19.44 And the conclusive blasts, the traumatic stress every war has its own form.
00:06:19.44 --> 00:06:22.48 And World War I, it was shell shock.
00:06:22.48 --> 00:06:28.48 And the horror of going over the top.
00:06:28.48 --> 00:06:33.88 World War II, the dreadfulness of close killing.
00:06:33.88 --> 00:06:41.64 The Vietnam, the confusion over who's good and who's bad.
00:06:41.64 --> 00:06:49.06 In our current modern wars, there's something else to contend with for our professional
00:06:49.06 --> 00:06:53.68 warriors.
00:06:53.68 --> 00:06:59.48 And that is the idea of an unending war.
00:06:59.48 --> 00:07:09.04 Because World War I, as heinous and awful as it was, was also finite.
00:07:09.04 --> 00:07:11.04 World War II is similar.
00:07:11.04 --> 00:07:14.84 I mean absolute horror, yes.
00:07:14.84 --> 00:07:21.000 But a horror that ended in four years.
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.60 Korean War lasted three years.
00:07:22.60 --> 00:07:29.84 Korean War is also where we started to see this idea of tours where soldiers would go over
00:07:29.84 --> 00:07:32.84 and do a tour.
00:07:32.84 --> 00:07:36.52 And then go home.
00:07:36.52 --> 00:07:38.52 And that was it.
00:07:38.52 --> 00:07:41.88 And the same thing in Vietnam.
00:07:41.88 --> 00:07:43.04 We all kind of know that story.
00:07:43.04 --> 00:07:45.60 Service members were required to do their hitch.
00:07:45.60 --> 00:07:49.24 And now.
00:07:49.24 --> 00:07:57.32 One year, count the days.
00:07:57.32 --> 00:08:04.92 And in all those cases, for a majority of soldiers, war was a finite thing.
00:08:04.92 --> 00:08:12.56 Yes, brutal, yes, horrific, yes, sickening.
00:08:12.56 --> 00:08:18.28 But had an endpoint.
00:08:18.28 --> 00:08:29.96 So many of this generation, our current generation, there's been no endpoint insight.
00:08:29.96 --> 00:08:41.42 It's been a constant exposure to violence, conclusive explosions, stress, deployment after
00:08:41.42 --> 00:08:46.04 deployment after deployment after deployment.
00:08:46.04 --> 00:08:52.84 And the training is elevated to, and that's repetitive over and over and over again.
00:08:52.84 --> 00:08:59.76 Explosive breaching of doors, firing rockets over and over again, improvised demolition shots,
00:08:59.76 --> 00:09:09.000 and then back on deployment again.
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:22.28 And that can become a never-ending cycle of trauma.
00:09:22.28 --> 00:09:36.04 And that's taken its toll on the mental health of some of our nation's finest warriors.
00:09:36.04 --> 00:09:47.52 And like, Chad Wilkinson, who received that silver star and who finally met his end,
00:09:47.52 --> 00:09:55.84 not on the battlefield by the hands of the enemy.
00:09:55.84 --> 00:10:12.60 Who sadly took his own life with suicide.
00:10:12.60 --> 00:10:17.84 And we have to learn from that.
00:10:17.84 --> 00:10:25.52 And here today to talk to us about Chad, and what he went through is his wife.
00:10:25.52 --> 00:10:32.72 Sarah Wilkinson, and joining her as Jason McCarthy, former Special Forces soldier, founder
00:10:32.72 --> 00:10:36.56 of Go Rock, and a friend of Sarah's.
00:10:36.56 --> 00:10:40.96 And together, they had been trying to share the message of mental health, remove the
00:10:40.96 --> 00:10:49.52 stigma's raise awareness, and encourage people to reach out if they need help.
00:10:49.52 --> 00:10:56.000 And encourage us all to help each other.
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.96 With that, Sarah, Jason.
00:10:58.96 --> 00:10:59.96 Thank you for joining us.
00:10:59.96 --> 00:11:00.96 Thank you.
00:11:00.96 --> 00:11:03.24 Good to see you guys again.
00:11:03.24 --> 00:11:05.08 Yeah, Jason came on before.
00:11:05.08 --> 00:11:12.84 You're on podcast 208 talking about your experiences in the Special Forces, in Florida,
00:11:12.84 --> 00:11:14.64 tennis champion.
00:11:14.64 --> 00:11:15.64 Almost championed.
00:11:15.64 --> 00:11:19.44 My mom was the dad of the mental growth champion.
00:11:19.44 --> 00:11:21.84 And Sarah, thank you so much for coming out.
00:11:21.84 --> 00:11:24.000 It's very, very awesome to meet you.
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.04 And I just want to, you know, get right into your story and the story of you and Chad.
00:11:29.04 --> 00:11:31.56 And let's start at the beginning.
00:11:31.56 --> 00:11:35.56 Where you from, where'd you grow up, how did it all start?
00:11:35.56 --> 00:11:39.08 I'm a military kid born, born, bread.
00:11:39.08 --> 00:11:40.48 My dad was marine.
00:11:40.48 --> 00:11:42.44 I'm the youngest of two.
00:11:42.44 --> 00:11:44.32 I have an older sister.
00:11:44.32 --> 00:11:47.64 My mom and dad met pretty young and got married.
00:11:47.64 --> 00:11:52.60 My dad joined the military, became a marine, and set off their path to move around every
00:11:52.60 --> 00:11:54.24 couple of years.
00:11:54.24 --> 00:11:55.92 Was he from a military family?
00:11:55.92 --> 00:11:56.92 No.
00:11:56.92 --> 00:11:59.16 He's randomly joined the Marine Corps.
00:11:59.16 --> 00:12:03.88 Uh, yeah, it was kind of like right where he just missed the draft.
00:12:03.88 --> 00:12:07.28 But yet, still felt the need to serve, I guess.
00:12:07.28 --> 00:12:12.08 He, they come from a small town in Ohio, where everyone kind of just stays in that same
00:12:12.08 --> 00:12:13.08 town.
00:12:13.08 --> 00:12:17.84 I think he wanted to find something bigger, maybe more challenging.
00:12:17.84 --> 00:12:18.84 I can relate.
00:12:18.84 --> 00:12:20.20 He wanted to serve his country.
00:12:20.20 --> 00:12:25.80 So yeah, his marine, I was a military kid, moved around all the time.
00:12:25.80 --> 00:12:30.08 My dad was an officer, so that means we moved every two to three years.
00:12:30.08 --> 00:12:32.48 We spent most of the time on the East Coast.
00:12:32.48 --> 00:12:36.96 We lived once overseas in Okinawa.
00:12:36.96 --> 00:12:42.000 And yeah, I, I mean, I went to 15 schools before I graduated.
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.76 So do you become super adaptable when you go to 15 schools?
00:12:46.76 --> 00:12:51.08 I guess you could either come super adaptable or just super in a shell and not talk to
00:12:51.08 --> 00:12:52.08 anybody.
00:12:52.08 --> 00:12:53.08 I, I really think you could go either way.
00:12:53.08 --> 00:12:56.08 You're either out there or you're, or you're rigid.
00:12:56.08 --> 00:12:59.60 I consider myself more like a chameleon because of that.
00:12:59.60 --> 00:13:04.96 So I can blend in in a room where I can stand out what needs to happen.
00:13:04.96 --> 00:13:09.68 So growing up moving all the time, I mean, I went to a different school fifth, sixth,
00:13:09.68 --> 00:13:16.16 seventh, eighth, ninth grade, different school each year for those years.
00:13:16.16 --> 00:13:17.16 So yeah.
00:13:17.16 --> 00:13:18.64 And then, and so then what about Chad?
00:13:18.64 --> 00:13:20.20 When did you meet Chad?
00:13:20.20 --> 00:13:21.84 First day of high school.
00:13:21.84 --> 00:13:22.96 And where was this?
00:13:22.96 --> 00:13:24.96 A quannico Virginia.
00:13:24.96 --> 00:13:28.92 So so my dad marine, right quannico's marine corpace.
00:13:28.92 --> 00:13:30.84 And his dad was Navy.
00:13:30.84 --> 00:13:32.72 His dad was a former seal.
00:13:32.72 --> 00:13:34.72 His uncle was also a seal.
00:13:34.72 --> 00:13:39.16 So he always wanted to be a seal from the time he was like 12.
00:13:39.16 --> 00:13:41.36 But his dad had switched rates.
00:13:41.36 --> 00:13:46.28 And then was kind of on the helicopter duty with the president.
00:13:46.28 --> 00:13:50.88 And so that's what brought him to quannico.
00:13:50.88 --> 00:13:52.64 Because otherwise, I don't think we would have mad.
00:13:52.64 --> 00:13:54.000 He would have never been there.
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.04 Yeah, we went to a really, really small school.
00:13:57.04 --> 00:13:58.68 It's a DOD high school.
00:13:58.68 --> 00:14:00.12 It doesn't exist anymore.
00:14:00.12 --> 00:14:04.60 So a high school that's on base that's just for the military kids.
00:14:04.60 --> 00:14:08.96 Our kids well behaved on the military school, on the military base school.
00:14:08.96 --> 00:14:12.32 Well, when I went, yes, because, you know, we're talking early 90s.
00:14:12.32 --> 00:14:17.92 But also on base, not on quannico when I moved to Lysun, this was the case.
00:14:17.92 --> 00:14:20.40 But a lot of times you would have a plaque in front of your house.
00:14:20.40 --> 00:14:24.72 So my house said there's a plaque that's at Colonel Trilice, out in front of her house.
00:14:24.72 --> 00:14:29.20 So you can really do too much because not only, you know, could they report to your dad.
00:14:29.20 --> 00:14:30.48 They knew where you live.
00:14:30.48 --> 00:14:32.64 So you're in a controlled environment.
00:14:32.64 --> 00:14:33.64 Pretty much, yeah.
00:14:33.64 --> 00:14:36.44 What kind of music were you listening to?
00:14:36.44 --> 00:14:39.88 Like grunge, you know, poppy type of music.
00:14:39.88 --> 00:14:41.40 Because what year is this?
00:14:41.40 --> 00:14:43.80 Well, when I met him, it was 91.
00:14:43.80 --> 00:14:47.000 So you're a freshman in high school in 91.
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.08 Yeah, so it was kind of peak grunge.
00:14:49.08 --> 00:14:49.40 Yeah.
00:14:49.40 --> 00:14:51.000 You were just getting your Nirvana.
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.80 Oh, yeah.
00:14:51.80 --> 00:14:52.60 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:14:52.60 --> 00:14:53.48 He loved Pearl.
00:14:53.48 --> 00:14:54.60 Yeah, yeah.
00:14:54.60 --> 00:14:55.24 Yeah.
00:14:55.24 --> 00:14:58.20 I still listen to it and just smile.
00:14:58.20 --> 00:15:00.80 So you guys meet and what?
00:15:00.80 --> 00:15:01.88 It was a love at first sight.
00:15:01.88 --> 00:15:02.88 Is there?
00:15:02.88 --> 00:15:03.72 For me?
00:15:03.72 --> 00:15:04.72 Oh, yeah.
00:15:04.72 --> 00:15:07.84 I mean, I don't know about him.
00:15:07.84 --> 00:15:13.12 Yeah, he, we, so go into a military school right off the bat the first day.
00:15:13.12 --> 00:15:16.72 There starts to be buzz about who the new kids are, who's this kid and this kid at
00:15:16.72 --> 00:15:18.20 the school is so, so small.
00:15:18.20 --> 00:15:20.56 And they were talking about the Wilkinson brothers.
00:15:20.56 --> 00:15:23.56 The girls were like, have you seen the Wilkinson brothers?
00:15:23.56 --> 00:15:25.24 I was like, what's the deal?
00:15:25.24 --> 00:15:31.56 But I smile because I just remember this so clearly sitting in the bleachers on the
00:15:31.56 --> 00:15:38.12 first day, traditional like PE coach just like intense colon roll and this kid was sitting
00:15:38.12 --> 00:15:39.12 in front of me.
00:15:39.12 --> 00:15:42.56 I saw the back of his head and they called Chad Wilkinson and he turned his head to the
00:15:42.56 --> 00:15:44.12 side and he said, here.
00:15:44.12 --> 00:15:46.68 And I was like, oh, well, I'm done.
00:15:46.68 --> 00:15:47.68 I like him.
00:15:47.68 --> 00:15:48.68 And that was it.
00:15:48.68 --> 00:15:50.48 How did you connect then?
00:15:50.48 --> 00:15:54.96 Well, I mean, a small school, we kind of, you, you just end being military kids.
00:15:54.96 --> 00:15:58.96 I think it was pretty natural for all of us to just be friends.
00:15:58.96 --> 00:16:03.52 There really wasn't like a cool group and a not cool group.
00:16:03.52 --> 00:16:07.20 Everybody, you were kind of forced to be friends with everybody because the school was so
00:16:07.20 --> 00:16:08.56 small and we got so small.
00:16:08.56 --> 00:16:10.16 How many people per grade?
00:16:10.16 --> 00:16:11.92 His graduating class was 24.
00:16:11.92 --> 00:16:12.92 I think.
00:16:12.92 --> 00:16:13.92 Oh, 24.
00:16:13.92 --> 00:16:14.92 That is really small.
00:16:14.92 --> 00:16:15.92 Yeah.
00:16:15.92 --> 00:16:16.92 Yeah.
00:16:16.92 --> 00:16:17.92 And so.
00:16:17.92 --> 00:16:18.92 That's like one classroom.
00:16:18.92 --> 00:16:19.92 Yeah.
00:16:19.92 --> 00:16:20.92 Yeah.
00:16:20.92 --> 00:16:23.52 We actually, the school was a middle school in high school together.
00:16:23.52 --> 00:16:24.96 It was just in a different hall.
00:16:24.96 --> 00:16:29.36 So high school took up like one hall and a half and the middle school took up like another
00:16:29.36 --> 00:16:30.76 hall and a half.
00:16:30.76 --> 00:16:34.20 And we didn't cross paths with the middle schoolers, but we were all in the same building.
00:16:34.20 --> 00:16:36.08 Now, were you guys in the same grade?
00:16:36.08 --> 00:16:37.28 Was he a freshman year freshman?
00:16:37.28 --> 00:16:39.44 No, he was just, he was a year older, sophomore.
00:16:39.44 --> 00:16:40.44 He was a sophomore.
00:16:40.44 --> 00:16:41.44 I was, yeah.
00:16:41.44 --> 00:16:47.44 And so then, like, what did he like say what's up, sister?
00:16:47.44 --> 00:16:48.44 I mean, what did he do?
00:16:48.44 --> 00:16:49.44 How do you roll?
00:16:49.44 --> 00:16:50.44 How did he just happen?
00:16:50.44 --> 00:16:51.44 He was pretty cool.
00:16:51.44 --> 00:16:54.28 I mean, I say there wasn't a cool group, but he was, I think he was pretty cool
00:16:54.28 --> 00:16:56.76 in high school and he was super athletic.
00:16:56.76 --> 00:17:01.32 And, I mean, for anybody who's listening, he's really good looking.
00:17:01.32 --> 00:17:04.24 So, you know, he had that going for him.
00:17:04.24 --> 00:17:07.60 We were just friends the first year or two.
00:17:07.60 --> 00:17:09.36 What sports did he play?
00:17:09.36 --> 00:17:12.04 Soccer, primarily.
00:17:12.04 --> 00:17:14.88 I think he was on the golf team one year.
00:17:14.88 --> 00:17:19.64 And I think he was the kicker for the football team one year because they just knew
00:17:19.64 --> 00:17:20.64 he could kick it.
00:17:20.64 --> 00:17:24.16 So he'd run out there, kick and then come off.
00:17:24.16 --> 00:17:27.24 But yeah, for two years, we were more or less just friends.
00:17:27.24 --> 00:17:32.80 I mean, in that period of time, he did ask me to go to homecoming.
00:17:32.80 --> 00:17:35.64 And I was super pumped about it.
00:17:35.64 --> 00:17:39.44 So homecoming is what?
00:17:39.44 --> 00:17:40.44 Like, yeah.
00:17:40.44 --> 00:17:42.40 The thing is, I went to a really small school too.
00:17:42.40 --> 00:17:44.36 I think I had 80 people in my graduating.
00:17:44.36 --> 00:17:45.92 I don't really remember the home.
00:17:45.92 --> 00:17:48.04 I know my, because I have kids too.
00:17:48.04 --> 00:17:49.88 And my daughters went to some kind of homecoming.
00:17:49.88 --> 00:17:51.48 But what's the deal with homecoming?
00:17:51.48 --> 00:17:53.40 I know the team came to my house.
00:17:53.40 --> 00:17:54.40 They were dressed up.
00:17:54.40 --> 00:17:56.16 The boys were wearing ties and like this tucking part.
00:17:56.16 --> 00:17:59.28 Yeah, it's basically a reason to get dressed up and have a party.
00:17:59.28 --> 00:18:02.24 And you know, back then it was big deal because it's a small school.
00:18:02.24 --> 00:18:04.08 And you have a huge pepper alley on Friday.
00:18:04.08 --> 00:18:05.08 And that was rally.
00:18:05.08 --> 00:18:06.08 Yeah.
00:18:06.08 --> 00:18:07.08 And we were pumped.
00:18:07.08 --> 00:18:09.80 I mean, my kids dread pepper alley is now they're like, that's lame.
00:18:09.80 --> 00:18:10.80 I'm not going.
00:18:10.80 --> 00:18:11.80 I'm like, why not?
00:18:11.80 --> 00:18:12.80 It's awesome.
00:18:12.80 --> 00:18:13.80 That's what we did.
00:18:13.80 --> 00:18:14.80 There was a football game.
00:18:14.80 --> 00:18:18.76 And then after the football game, you had a dance.
00:18:18.76 --> 00:18:19.76 And you get dressed up.
00:18:19.76 --> 00:18:23.36 And you got the like corsage and the flower and the whole thing.
00:18:23.36 --> 00:18:24.36 Yeah.
00:18:24.36 --> 00:18:26.32 It's a different time.
00:18:26.32 --> 00:18:31.64 You know, I was looking at a boot camp, a picture of myself the other day.
00:18:31.64 --> 00:18:35.20 And the picture was taken in 1990, right?
00:18:35.20 --> 00:18:39.16 So I posted, I was like, I posted on my social media page.
00:18:39.16 --> 00:18:40.16 Right?
00:18:40.16 --> 00:18:41.72 Hey, you know, here's a new boot camp.
00:18:41.72 --> 00:18:44.56 And I thought, so that's 1990.
00:18:44.56 --> 00:18:48.96 That's 31 years ago.
00:18:48.96 --> 00:18:53.08 That means when I was in boot camp, if I would have looked at a picture that was
00:18:53.08 --> 00:18:56.80 31 years old, it would have been from 1960.
00:18:56.80 --> 00:18:57.80 Yeah.
00:18:57.80 --> 00:18:58.80 Crazy.
00:18:58.80 --> 00:19:04.000 And then I have sometimes on the podcast, I'll have guys on that run, you know, World
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.84 World 2 career Vietnam, but recently had a bunch of Vietnam guys on.
00:19:07.84 --> 00:19:10.48 And they're just like, they're talking about pepper rallies.
00:19:10.48 --> 00:19:11.48 Like these kind of things.
00:19:11.48 --> 00:19:13.08 It was just a different time.
00:19:13.08 --> 00:19:14.48 I think you caught the end of it.
00:19:14.48 --> 00:19:15.48 I caught the tail end of it.
00:19:15.48 --> 00:19:16.48 I think I did.
00:19:16.48 --> 00:19:20.24 I think I found like the sweet spot of high school before all that.
00:19:20.24 --> 00:19:23.96 I was blew up and diminished.
00:19:23.96 --> 00:19:24.96 I don't know.
00:19:24.96 --> 00:19:27.000 Okay, so you get started to sidetrack.
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.16 I kind of needed to know about homecomings.
00:19:29.16 --> 00:19:32.56 Because my two daughters went to home, the homecoming thing.
00:19:32.56 --> 00:19:35.72 They got picked up by some dudes at the house.
00:19:35.72 --> 00:19:39.16 The guys were wearing ties and whatnot.
00:19:39.16 --> 00:19:40.40 I tracked it, no one.
00:19:40.40 --> 00:19:41.40 We're good.
00:19:44.40 --> 00:19:46.48 Okay, so you get asked the homecoming, my Chad?
00:19:46.48 --> 00:19:47.48 Yeah.
00:19:47.48 --> 00:19:52.96 And it was just the dance and then later.
00:19:52.96 --> 00:19:57.44 Well, so we asked me after we got in a food fight in the cafeteria.
00:19:57.44 --> 00:19:58.44 Where you got in a food fight?
00:19:58.44 --> 00:19:59.44 No, he got in a food fight.
00:19:59.44 --> 00:20:00.44 Okay.
00:20:00.44 --> 00:20:01.44 He's great.
00:20:01.44 --> 00:20:05.24 And he came up, he had food on a shirt and stuff.
00:20:05.24 --> 00:20:09.000 And then he's like, hey, as he would say, you want to go to homecoming with me?
00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.40 I tried to act not really excited, but I was like, all right.
00:20:12.40 --> 00:20:13.72 It was like, yes.
00:20:13.72 --> 00:20:14.72 Score.
00:20:14.72 --> 00:20:16.52 So yeah, and we just went homecoming.
00:20:16.52 --> 00:20:17.88 And then that was that.
00:20:17.88 --> 00:20:18.88 We didn't date or anything.
00:20:18.88 --> 00:20:22.76 And then fast forward to the following spring.
00:20:22.76 --> 00:20:29.28 One more thing about homecoming and dances in high school was their particular like songs
00:20:29.28 --> 00:20:31.64 that were repetitive.
00:20:31.64 --> 00:20:36.88 Because when I went to high school, every single dance that I went through, which started
00:20:36.88 --> 00:20:42.60 in mid-School, which was, I guess, it was 7th, so 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade.
00:20:42.60 --> 00:20:45.76 Every single dance that I went to.
00:20:45.76 --> 00:20:47.40 That's where we had dances, I don't know what they're called now.
00:20:47.40 --> 00:20:50.32 But every single dance we went to, every single one.
00:20:50.32 --> 00:20:54.48 So there's probably 4 or 5 a year, you know, 6 or 30 times.
00:20:54.48 --> 00:20:59.68 The song that would play at the end of the night was, was, stay where it had a Led Zeppelin.
00:20:59.68 --> 00:21:00.68 Oh, yeah.
00:21:00.68 --> 00:21:01.68 Is that a normal transition?
00:21:01.68 --> 00:21:03.08 Is that a worldwide tradition?
00:21:03.08 --> 00:21:05.68 I think it's just a really good march-out song.
00:21:05.68 --> 00:21:08.48 They're like, yeah, beat it.
00:21:08.48 --> 00:21:09.96 Lights are coming up.
00:21:09.96 --> 00:21:11.52 Mozy out the door.
00:21:11.52 --> 00:21:12.52 Right on.
00:21:12.52 --> 00:21:13.52 Right on.
00:21:13.52 --> 00:21:16.28 So you go to this dance and I cut you off.
00:21:16.28 --> 00:21:18.80 So you go to the dance and that was it.
00:21:18.80 --> 00:21:20.36 Nothing really became of it.
00:21:20.36 --> 00:21:25.04 But then fast forward a couple of months later, towards the end of the year, he would go
00:21:25.04 --> 00:21:26.04 by me in the locker.
00:21:26.04 --> 00:21:30.96 You know, I'd be see him in the locker and he'd walk by and he just, hey, the whole, hey.
00:21:30.96 --> 00:21:34.36 And I just, I kind of just did the whole girl flip out thing.
00:21:34.36 --> 00:21:37.28 Like, oh my god, he said, hey to me.
00:21:37.28 --> 00:21:39.88 And then he needed help with a history paper, apparently.
00:21:39.88 --> 00:21:40.88 They asked me to help.
00:21:40.88 --> 00:21:41.88 They asked me to help.
00:21:41.88 --> 00:21:42.88 Yeah.
00:21:42.88 --> 00:21:46.08 So I was like, okay, and then he asked me out to dinner.
00:21:46.08 --> 00:21:48.80 I went to dinner and we started dating pretty much.
00:21:48.80 --> 00:21:49.52 So that was-
00:21:49.52 --> 00:21:50.52 Where'd you go to dinner?
00:21:50.52 --> 00:21:51.80 We went to this Mexican restaurant.
00:21:51.80 --> 00:21:53.36 I don't think it even exists anymore.
00:21:53.36 --> 00:21:54.36 I don't know the name of it.
00:21:54.36 --> 00:21:55.36 And a quiet harbor.
00:21:55.36 --> 00:21:56.68 We'll shout out.
00:21:56.68 --> 00:22:01.72 I don't know if I actually asked a girl to dinner until I was in my twigs.
00:22:01.72 --> 00:22:04.92 Who are you at class?
00:22:04.92 --> 00:22:07.28 Well, I don't even know if I should share all this.
00:22:07.28 --> 00:22:09.68 But we actually also went to a movie.
00:22:09.68 --> 00:22:13.80 And we bought tickets to some stupid movie because we couldn't get in a radar movie.
00:22:13.80 --> 00:22:17.24 And then we snuck into the movie, sliver.
00:22:17.24 --> 00:22:18.80 Do you guys remember that movie?
00:22:18.80 --> 00:22:19.80 Harbor movie?
00:22:19.80 --> 00:22:20.80 It's like sexy smutnik.
00:22:20.80 --> 00:22:21.80 Oh, oh.
00:22:21.80 --> 00:22:26.80 And I'm like, on this date, now I was like, oh, there's a lot of artists sharing stone.
00:22:26.80 --> 00:22:28.80 I, oh, I think so.
00:22:28.80 --> 00:22:30.52 I actually don't remember who was in it.
00:22:30.52 --> 00:22:35.44 I mean, this was a long long time ago, but I just remember being like completely red.
00:22:35.44 --> 00:22:37.44 Thankfully, in a dark movie theater.
00:22:37.44 --> 00:22:38.44 And Marist.
00:22:38.44 --> 00:22:39.44 Yeah, but we did.
00:22:39.44 --> 00:22:41.88 But dinner and snuck in a red at our movie.
00:22:41.88 --> 00:22:42.88 Crazy.
00:22:42.88 --> 00:22:43.88 Crazy kid.
00:22:43.88 --> 00:22:44.88 Kids were getting crazy.
00:22:44.88 --> 00:22:45.88 I know.
00:22:45.88 --> 00:22:46.88 That's what you was at.
00:22:46.88 --> 00:22:48.60 Was this one his senior year?
00:22:48.60 --> 00:22:51.40 I was, it was the end of my sophomore year.
00:22:51.40 --> 00:22:52.68 His junior year.
00:22:52.68 --> 00:22:53.68 Okay.
00:22:53.68 --> 00:22:54.68 And so this was 1993.
00:22:54.68 --> 00:22:55.68 Okay.
00:22:55.68 --> 00:22:57.08 Really started dating.
00:22:57.08 --> 00:22:58.48 So now you're legit dating.
00:22:58.48 --> 00:22:59.48 Yeah.
00:22:59.48 --> 00:23:01.48 Through the summer?
00:23:01.48 --> 00:23:03.12 Well, so then I was coming in the fall.
00:23:03.12 --> 00:23:04.12 Yeah.
00:23:04.12 --> 00:23:05.12 Well, then it was for us.
00:23:05.12 --> 00:23:06.12 I don't know if it changes.
00:23:06.12 --> 00:23:08.36 But it was like October.
00:23:08.36 --> 00:23:10.72 I have a really great picture from that day.
00:23:10.72 --> 00:23:12.92 I should pass it to you just because it's good.
00:23:12.92 --> 00:23:18.12 But no, my dad got stationed in Lajoon.
00:23:18.12 --> 00:23:20.56 So I had to leave after my sophomore year.
00:23:20.56 --> 00:23:21.56 Yeah.
00:23:21.56 --> 00:23:25.76 And that was the only time I was ever really pissed, honestly.
00:23:25.76 --> 00:23:27.60 Every move I'd be like, okay.
00:23:27.60 --> 00:23:28.96 We didn't get family vacations.
00:23:28.96 --> 00:23:29.96 We moved.
00:23:29.96 --> 00:23:30.96 That's what happened.
00:23:30.96 --> 00:23:32.16 And then you're on a new adventure.
00:23:32.16 --> 00:23:33.72 And this was the only time I was mad.
00:23:33.72 --> 00:23:34.72 And so.
00:23:34.72 --> 00:23:35.72 What were you into for?
00:23:35.72 --> 00:23:36.92 Were you doing sports as well?
00:23:36.92 --> 00:23:37.92 I was.
00:23:37.92 --> 00:23:38.92 I was a swimmer.
00:23:38.92 --> 00:23:39.92 I was a swimmer.
00:23:39.92 --> 00:23:40.92 Cool.
00:23:40.92 --> 00:23:41.92 Yeah.
00:23:41.92 --> 00:23:42.92 So I was that person and it's like, you wake up at five.
00:23:42.92 --> 00:23:43.92 You swim.
00:23:43.92 --> 00:23:44.92 You go to school.
00:23:44.92 --> 00:23:45.92 You swim.
00:23:45.92 --> 00:23:46.92 You swim a lot.
00:23:46.92 --> 00:23:47.92 Yeah.
00:23:47.92 --> 00:23:48.92 Okay.
00:23:48.92 --> 00:23:49.92 So now you have to go to Camp Lajoon.
00:23:49.92 --> 00:23:50.92 Yeah.
00:23:50.92 --> 00:23:53.76 So I managed to work a deal.
00:23:53.76 --> 00:23:56.92 And I stayed at my best friends house.
00:23:56.92 --> 00:23:58.76 Steph cutty.
00:23:58.76 --> 00:23:59.76 So I could hang out with her.
00:23:59.76 --> 00:24:02.04 But really, so I could hang out with Chad.
00:24:02.04 --> 00:24:03.04 Let's be honest.
00:24:03.04 --> 00:24:04.04 I want to already.
00:24:04.04 --> 00:24:07.80 And yeah, I just hung out that summer as a lifeguard.
00:24:07.80 --> 00:24:10.72 I got the pool on base through high school as a lifeguard.
00:24:10.72 --> 00:24:12.72 And I pulled butts at the shooting range.
00:24:12.72 --> 00:24:13.72 Dang.
00:24:13.72 --> 00:24:14.72 You know, like, rolling up.
00:24:14.72 --> 00:24:18.96 And we, all the high school kids, we just sit there like in this little dugout with
00:24:18.96 --> 00:24:25.52 your pro on and you'd see the bullet go and you pull the target, slap the sticker on it,
00:24:25.52 --> 00:24:26.52 throw it back up.
00:24:26.52 --> 00:24:27.52 It's how we spent our weekends.
00:24:27.52 --> 00:24:28.52 Minimum wage?
00:24:28.52 --> 00:24:29.52 Oh, yeah.
00:24:29.52 --> 00:24:30.52 I was barely making anything.
00:24:30.52 --> 00:24:32.52 Well, I mean, I was actually in the Navy.
00:24:32.52 --> 00:24:33.52 And I did that.
00:24:33.52 --> 00:24:34.52 But I did have for each other.
00:24:34.52 --> 00:24:35.52 That's what we did.
00:24:35.52 --> 00:24:37.52 Well, I have.
00:24:37.52 --> 00:24:39.68 So people to come down and do it for us.
00:24:39.68 --> 00:24:41.24 I guess that's some wrinkle or officer thing.
00:24:41.24 --> 00:24:43.84 Well, our friends dad pretty much ran the rain.
00:24:43.84 --> 00:24:46.28 So I think he just like, I'm going to make these kids do something.
00:24:46.28 --> 00:24:49.04 And so we could hang out with our friends all day on the weekend.
00:24:49.04 --> 00:24:50.88 It makes me sound like such a nerd.
00:24:50.88 --> 00:24:51.72 Not that I'm saying this.
00:24:51.72 --> 00:24:53.72 I didn't do anything like super crazy in high school.
00:24:53.72 --> 00:24:57.76 But we could hang out with our friends and get paid a little bit of money.
00:24:57.76 --> 00:24:58.76 Okay.
00:24:58.76 --> 00:25:01.28 So that's where you spend the summer and this whole time you're hanging out with Chad.
00:25:01.28 --> 00:25:05.16 So you guys are a tight, getting tight at this time or a thing.
00:25:05.16 --> 00:25:06.36 But you're going to bail.
00:25:06.36 --> 00:25:07.36 Yeah.
00:25:07.36 --> 00:25:08.36 I'm just ticking.
00:25:08.36 --> 00:25:10.60 And yep, so I moved to Lajoon.
00:25:10.60 --> 00:25:12.40 We continued dating.
00:25:12.40 --> 00:25:13.40 I'm a junior.
00:25:13.40 --> 00:25:15.08 He's a senior.
00:25:15.08 --> 00:25:17.92 And he would drive down on the weekends.
00:25:17.92 --> 00:25:22.32 Which was kind of a big deal because you know, he was fairly newly licensed, you know,
00:25:22.32 --> 00:25:24.72 and his mom and dad would let him drive.
00:25:24.72 --> 00:25:26.48 The minivan or what was he driving?
00:25:26.48 --> 00:25:29.08 No, he had an old oldsmoble.
00:25:29.08 --> 00:25:31.60 I think at my time, it belonged to his grandpa.
00:25:31.60 --> 00:25:34.08 And like the front seat was busted.
00:25:34.08 --> 00:25:36.40 So it like sat crooked.
00:25:36.40 --> 00:25:37.40 And he was a hoopty.
00:25:37.40 --> 00:25:38.64 It was great.
00:25:38.64 --> 00:25:42.88 And he would drive that down on the weekends and see me and then drive back.
00:25:42.88 --> 00:25:45.24 Not every weekend, but as much as he could.
00:25:45.24 --> 00:25:46.24 Stay the night.
00:25:46.24 --> 00:25:47.24 Mm-hmm.
00:25:47.24 --> 00:25:48.24 Parents were cool.
00:25:48.24 --> 00:25:49.24 Yeah.
00:25:49.24 --> 00:25:53.92 This was like a thing because my parents, my mom said to me recently, like in the last year,
00:25:53.92 --> 00:25:57.40 we had some conversations just about this, Chad and I are youth.
00:25:57.40 --> 00:25:59.40 And she said, I don't know what it was.
00:25:59.40 --> 00:26:05.24 I just, we just always knew that the relationship with you and Chad was just something
00:26:05.24 --> 00:26:06.24 different.
00:26:06.24 --> 00:26:07.24 And he stayed.
00:26:07.24 --> 00:26:09.08 I mean, he stayed in the separate room.
00:26:09.08 --> 00:26:10.80 He wasn't my room, but yeah.
00:26:10.80 --> 00:26:13.24 Well, at least as far as the birds know.
00:26:13.24 --> 00:26:14.24 I mean, yeah.
00:26:14.24 --> 00:26:19.24 He was getting tactical.
00:26:19.24 --> 00:26:21.24 I'm sure at some point.
00:26:21.24 --> 00:26:22.24 I am.
00:26:22.24 --> 00:26:24.24 You're playing the fair thing.
00:26:24.24 --> 00:26:26.24 Cool.
00:26:26.24 --> 00:26:30.24 So then how long does this long distance relationship work?
00:26:30.24 --> 00:26:35.92 So we, and so we date and then when I, so he graduates, an homiceneer.
00:26:35.92 --> 00:26:37.08 So I'm a senior.
00:26:37.08 --> 00:26:38.60 He graduates high school.
00:26:38.60 --> 00:26:43.52 His mom and dad moved to Florida to Orlando now.
00:26:43.52 --> 00:26:45.64 When he's in high school, is he talking about joining the Navy?
00:26:45.64 --> 00:26:47.44 Has he talked about going in the dreams?
00:26:47.44 --> 00:26:52.56 He always kind of, I think he just always knew that's what he was going to do.
00:26:52.56 --> 00:26:54.20 It wasn't that he talked about it in excess.
00:26:54.20 --> 00:26:55.52 So he has two brothers.
00:26:55.52 --> 00:26:56.72 He's the oldest.
00:26:56.72 --> 00:26:58.88 Two brothers in the necister.
00:26:58.88 --> 00:27:05.88 And his house was just full of, you know, every classic, seal movie.
00:27:05.88 --> 00:27:12.80 You know, speck up movie, you know, he had posters on his wall, which I think I still
00:27:12.80 --> 00:27:15.44 have that you probably can't even find anywhere anymore.
00:27:15.44 --> 00:27:19.88 But I think it was just something he always knew that's what he was going to do.
00:27:19.88 --> 00:27:22.44 I don't ever remember him talking about anything else.
00:27:22.44 --> 00:27:26.12 Like, oh, I might go to business school or something.
00:27:26.12 --> 00:27:27.12 No.
00:27:27.12 --> 00:27:31.76 It was so obvious to him and you that it was not even really a big subject.
00:27:31.76 --> 00:27:33.64 It was like, yeah, well, what else am I going to do?
00:27:33.64 --> 00:27:34.64 That type of thing?
00:27:34.64 --> 00:27:35.64 Yeah.
00:27:35.64 --> 00:27:41.28 And I mean, even then, I don't think at my age, I was even thinking about, you know,
00:27:41.28 --> 00:27:42.28 our life together.
00:27:42.28 --> 00:27:44.36 Like, oh, I'm going to marry him.
00:27:44.36 --> 00:27:47.52 I doodle this name a lot on all my notebooks because that's what you do.
00:27:47.52 --> 00:27:50.96 And I am his, your grunge t-shirt and your boy crush.
00:27:50.96 --> 00:27:56.56 But I just always thought, I'm just going to be wherever he is.
00:27:56.56 --> 00:28:01.16 You know, I wasn't thinking like marriage, but I just knew whatever he is is where I want
00:28:01.16 --> 00:28:02.16 to be.
00:28:02.16 --> 00:28:03.16 Right on.
00:28:03.16 --> 00:28:04.80 So what happens?
00:28:04.80 --> 00:28:05.80 Oh, we break up.
00:28:05.80 --> 00:28:06.80 So that kind of.
00:28:06.80 --> 00:28:07.80 Yeah.
00:28:07.80 --> 00:28:08.80 So we broke up.
00:28:08.80 --> 00:28:09.80 Oh, this is your senior year.
00:28:09.80 --> 00:28:10.80 My senior year.
00:28:10.80 --> 00:28:11.80 So he's going.
00:28:11.80 --> 00:28:13.96 Yeah, so he moved down to Florida.
00:28:13.96 --> 00:28:18.60 And so the deal was, is he wanted to be an officer.
00:28:18.60 --> 00:28:23.64 And at that time, so he enrolled in the University of Central Florida.
00:28:23.64 --> 00:28:25.20 His mom and dad are in Orlando.
00:28:25.20 --> 00:28:26.68 He's down there with them.
00:28:26.68 --> 00:28:28.20 He's thinking, I'm going to go to college.
00:28:28.20 --> 00:28:32.22 I'm going to get a four year degree and then I'm going to go do the whole Navy, Buds
00:28:32.22 --> 00:28:33.22 Deal.
00:28:33.22 --> 00:28:37.34 But they were saying, hey, we're not really taking officers right now because we just
00:28:37.34 --> 00:28:38.34 don't need them.
00:28:38.34 --> 00:28:42.46 So you can go get your degree, but it's not that's not going to work out.
00:28:42.46 --> 00:28:51.86 And so basically a year in college, he said, OK, I'm out and joined.
00:28:51.86 --> 00:28:55.02 So we broke up my senior year.
00:28:55.02 --> 00:28:58.58 Did you break up before or after he joined the Navy before?
00:28:58.58 --> 00:29:01.02 So before he's in Orlando, I'm in Luzune.
00:29:01.02 --> 00:29:02.02 We break up.
00:29:02.02 --> 00:29:07.50 Really, just because I think you got friends are like, why are you dating some boy that
00:29:07.50 --> 00:29:08.82 looks so far away?
00:29:08.82 --> 00:29:10.46 That's stupid.
00:29:10.46 --> 00:29:11.46 All the things.
00:29:11.46 --> 00:29:13.26 So we broke up.
00:29:13.26 --> 00:29:19.94 And we spent two and a half years pretty much went by in that time.
00:29:19.94 --> 00:29:24.42 The time he was in college and my senior year.
00:29:24.42 --> 00:29:30.46 And then my first year after graduating high school, we just didn't really speak to each
00:29:30.46 --> 00:29:31.46 other.
00:29:31.46 --> 00:29:35.34 And this was before cell phones or social media.
00:29:35.34 --> 00:29:39.74 You can't properly cyber stalk somebody back in the day.
00:29:39.74 --> 00:29:40.74 Right.
00:29:40.74 --> 00:29:43.42 And I would stay in touch with his sister, his little sister.
00:29:43.42 --> 00:29:46.38 So she's 10 years younger than him.
00:29:46.38 --> 00:29:47.38 She was pretty young.
00:29:47.38 --> 00:29:48.38 I mean, I don't know when she was five.
00:29:48.38 --> 00:29:50.38 So she's pretty young.
00:29:50.38 --> 00:29:51.38 But.
00:29:51.38 --> 00:29:53.50 And so I always kind of knew what he was doing.
00:29:53.50 --> 00:29:57.66 And I knew he joined the Navy and you know, went to boot camp and was going to buds.
00:29:57.66 --> 00:30:03.98 And I really wanted to be there for his graduation of buds.
00:30:03.98 --> 00:30:08.90 But I thought that might be weird if I just show up.
00:30:08.90 --> 00:30:10.78 Plus I'd never been a California, the whole thing.
00:30:10.78 --> 00:30:11.78 I'm living.
00:30:11.78 --> 00:30:13.18 I'm going to confirm that would be weird.
00:30:13.18 --> 00:30:14.18 Yeah.
00:30:14.18 --> 00:30:15.18 Yeah.
00:30:15.18 --> 00:30:19.38 And so during this time, you know, he goes to college, joins the military.
00:30:19.38 --> 00:30:20.38 I finish high school.
00:30:20.38 --> 00:30:24.78 My family moves to Tampa because my dad is at St. Com.
00:30:24.78 --> 00:30:28.10 So his family is Orlando, my family is in Tampa.
00:30:28.10 --> 00:30:31.02 I'm going to community college.
00:30:31.02 --> 00:30:33.50 And I think I want to be there for his buds graduation.
00:30:33.50 --> 00:30:34.50 But I can't do that.
00:30:34.50 --> 00:30:37.18 So I need to put myself in a position that doesn't allow me to do that.
00:30:37.18 --> 00:30:38.94 So I went on a cruise.
00:30:38.94 --> 00:30:42.18 And I thought if I'm on a boat, I can't get off the boat.
00:30:42.18 --> 00:30:44.46 And I'm like 19 or something.
00:30:44.46 --> 00:30:46.82 And we doted and we doted in New Orleans.
00:30:46.82 --> 00:30:49.82 And I told my girlfriend, I was like, I'm getting off the boat.
00:30:49.82 --> 00:30:50.82 I'm going to go get on a plane.
00:30:50.82 --> 00:30:52.42 And I'm just going to show up there.
00:30:52.42 --> 00:30:53.42 And she's like, OK.
00:30:53.42 --> 00:30:56.02 And I realize it didn't have any money to get there.
00:30:56.02 --> 00:30:57.54 I'd spend it all in the cruise.
00:30:57.54 --> 00:31:00.02 And were you, but you hadn't been communicating with him?
00:31:00.02 --> 00:31:01.14 No, during this time period.
00:31:01.14 --> 00:31:03.06 No, just keep an in touch with a sister.
00:31:03.06 --> 00:31:05.86 And like his mom would check in from time to time.
00:31:05.86 --> 00:31:07.50 And his mom still liked you.
00:31:07.50 --> 00:31:09.14 Yeah, I hope.
00:31:09.14 --> 00:31:10.14 You know?
00:31:10.14 --> 00:31:11.18 So yeah.
00:31:11.18 --> 00:31:13.14 So then he graduates buds.
00:31:13.14 --> 00:31:14.42 So he graduates buds.
00:31:14.42 --> 00:31:15.58 And now what happens?
00:31:15.58 --> 00:31:18.02 Well, I knew he graduated buds.
00:31:18.02 --> 00:31:20.78 And then I also knew he was coming back to Orlando.
00:31:20.78 --> 00:31:25.94 So I took a couple days off work and just waited.
00:31:25.94 --> 00:31:28.90 And then he called and said, hey, I'd really like to see you.
00:31:28.90 --> 00:31:31.82 And I was like, oh, that's cool.
00:31:31.82 --> 00:31:34.02 Let me see if I can get off work.
00:31:34.02 --> 00:31:35.42 You know, you got to play tough.
00:31:35.42 --> 00:31:39.66 And yeah, I didn't drove there.
00:31:39.66 --> 00:31:41.38 Was super nervous.
00:31:41.38 --> 00:31:43.78 His brother, I think, opened the door.
00:31:43.78 --> 00:31:46.30 He was wrestling his other brother in the background,
00:31:46.30 --> 00:31:47.62 probably trying to play it cool.
00:31:47.62 --> 00:31:50.30 And pretty much the same thing as that day on the bleachers.
00:31:50.30 --> 00:31:54.54 And now as soon as I saw him, I was like, man.
00:31:54.54 --> 00:31:58.14 So he had graduated buds at that point.
00:31:58.14 --> 00:32:00.82 So now he must be on orders got orders to a team.
00:32:00.82 --> 00:32:01.82 Yeah.
00:32:01.82 --> 00:32:03.98 So he had to go.
00:32:03.98 --> 00:32:07.34 This is when they were had specific rates.
00:32:07.34 --> 00:32:08.78 Your time for him, probably too.
00:32:08.78 --> 00:32:10.82 So he went to the medics school.
00:32:10.82 --> 00:32:11.82 Oh, so yeah.
00:32:11.82 --> 00:32:14.66 So actually, so he what he got was he must have been a corpsman.
00:32:14.66 --> 00:32:16.94 And then they would take corpsman and after buds,
00:32:16.94 --> 00:32:20.54 they would take corpsman and send him to 18 delta,
00:32:20.54 --> 00:32:23.62 the special forces medics school.
00:32:23.62 --> 00:32:24.98 What's interesting about that?
00:32:24.98 --> 00:32:26.94 And I might mess this up a little bit.
00:32:26.94 --> 00:32:31.38 But his dad then had orders to Fort Bragg
00:32:31.38 --> 00:32:33.82 and his dad ran that school.
00:32:33.82 --> 00:32:37.70 So he went through the school that his dad was running.
00:32:37.70 --> 00:32:38.46 That's interesting.
00:32:38.46 --> 00:32:39.70 That's awesome.
00:32:39.70 --> 00:32:41.30 I guess he got some good grades.
00:32:41.30 --> 00:32:41.98 Hopefully.
00:32:41.98 --> 00:32:42.98 Yeah.
00:32:42.98 --> 00:32:43.82 He's a smart guy.
00:32:43.82 --> 00:32:45.58 It's good in school.
00:32:45.58 --> 00:32:47.62 So so so then what happens?
00:32:47.62 --> 00:32:49.14 So then he's going to that school.
00:32:49.14 --> 00:32:50.50 Now are you two back together?
00:32:50.50 --> 00:32:51.98 Is this like we're back?
00:32:51.98 --> 00:32:52.82 We're back.
00:32:52.82 --> 00:32:53.46 Yeah.
00:32:53.46 --> 00:32:54.66 So we're back together.
00:32:54.66 --> 00:32:57.58 And this is I had 96.
00:32:57.58 --> 00:33:00.74 And so I decide because I want to be wherever he is,
00:33:00.74 --> 00:33:02.98 I'm going to go to college at Methodist,
00:33:02.98 --> 00:33:05.34 which is a really small school in Fayville.
00:33:05.34 --> 00:33:07.02 So I go up there for semester.
00:33:07.02 --> 00:33:09.38 I had to do a whole presentation of my dad,
00:33:09.38 --> 00:33:11.42 my dad, right, Colonel Marine Corps.
00:33:11.42 --> 00:33:12.66 He always says when you want to do something
00:33:12.66 --> 00:33:14.34 you've got every ducks lined up and come to me.
00:33:14.34 --> 00:33:17.42 And I did like a report and figured out how much it was cost.
00:33:17.42 --> 00:33:18.62 I got scholarships.
00:33:18.62 --> 00:33:20.06 I got different things.
00:33:20.06 --> 00:33:22.22 How much it would be paid for?
00:33:22.22 --> 00:33:26.34 Really because I just wanted to be closer to Chad.
00:33:26.34 --> 00:33:28.42 Was that part of the briefing or not?
00:33:28.42 --> 00:33:30.70 I think he probably understood that.
00:33:30.70 --> 00:33:32.54 But I lasted one semester.
00:33:32.54 --> 00:33:33.26 I hated it.
00:33:33.26 --> 00:33:33.94 And I left.
00:33:33.94 --> 00:33:35.10 I went back to Florida.
00:33:35.10 --> 00:33:36.42 So he did the medical school.
00:33:36.42 --> 00:33:38.54 And then he was off to Silti Mait.
00:33:38.54 --> 00:33:38.98 And then what?
00:33:38.98 --> 00:33:40.18 Once he got to Silti Mait,
00:33:40.18 --> 00:33:41.94 did you guys reconnect again?
00:33:41.94 --> 00:33:46.02 Well, so we are dating long distance now.
00:33:46.02 --> 00:33:49.70 He's at teammate down in Florida.
00:33:49.70 --> 00:33:52.74 And then I end up going to the University of Florida.
00:33:52.74 --> 00:33:56.06 And we're thinking, OK, I'm going to do college down here.
00:33:56.06 --> 00:33:56.86 You're going to do that.
00:33:56.86 --> 00:33:58.98 And then we break up again.
00:33:58.98 --> 00:33:59.70 Yeah.
00:33:59.70 --> 00:34:02.10 So two pretty big breakups.
00:34:02.10 --> 00:34:07.58 It's hard to check into a team and have a girlfriend,
00:34:07.58 --> 00:34:10.14 or whatever, no offense to girlfriends of the world.
00:34:10.14 --> 00:34:12.98 You get to a team that is like you are going down.
00:34:12.98 --> 00:34:15.90 You are a, when you're a young new team guy,
00:34:15.90 --> 00:34:19.14 you have so much on your mind as far as work goes,
00:34:19.14 --> 00:34:23.26 it's like, hey, I don't have time for anything else right now.
00:34:23.26 --> 00:34:24.26 And I don't know.
00:34:24.26 --> 00:34:27.54 That's probably has at least a little something to do with it.
00:34:27.54 --> 00:34:28.46 You're down in Florida.
00:34:28.46 --> 00:34:30.02 He's up there, like, wanting to make sure he's
00:34:30.02 --> 00:34:30.66 good to go for this.
00:34:30.66 --> 00:34:31.82 And that.
00:34:31.82 --> 00:34:32.34 Yeah.
00:34:32.34 --> 00:34:35.26 Just had, I mean, he would drive down still on the weekends.
00:34:35.26 --> 00:34:35.98 Oh, we're still dating.
00:34:35.98 --> 00:34:36.82 We're still dating.
00:34:36.82 --> 00:34:37.66 Yeah.
00:34:37.66 --> 00:34:38.30 Like that gets full credit.
00:34:38.30 --> 00:34:38.66 Yeah.
00:34:38.66 --> 00:34:41.46 And, um, but yeah, we broke up.
00:34:41.46 --> 00:34:46.34 And that was just terrible because I really thought
00:34:46.34 --> 00:34:47.54 that that was probably it.
00:34:47.54 --> 00:34:51.18 I thought I probably lost him forever.
00:34:51.18 --> 00:34:54.46 And then how long are you guys broken up for?
00:34:54.46 --> 00:34:56.34 Ah, trying to think of the timeline.
00:34:56.34 --> 00:35:00.02 I was probably like a year, year and a half.
00:35:00.02 --> 00:35:00.86 Something like that.
00:35:00.86 --> 00:35:02.86 Did he do, did he do his first deployment?
00:35:02.86 --> 00:35:03.22 Yeah.
00:35:03.22 --> 00:35:06.10 He did a deployment of his on the enterprise.
00:35:06.10 --> 00:35:07.10 He was on a ship.
00:35:07.10 --> 00:35:08.98 Only a time he was on a ship at that time.
00:35:08.98 --> 00:35:11.54 And what you was that?
00:35:11.54 --> 00:35:16.66 Um, probably 97 or 8.
00:35:16.66 --> 00:35:17.18 Okay.
00:35:17.18 --> 00:35:18.34 Somewhere in that.
00:35:18.34 --> 00:35:19.18 Right on.
00:35:19.18 --> 00:35:20.18 Yeah.
00:35:20.18 --> 00:35:22.34 So he's, he does a deployment.
00:35:22.34 --> 00:35:23.34 He's a medic.
00:35:23.34 --> 00:35:24.34 Yep.
00:35:24.34 --> 00:35:25.34 You guys are broken up.
00:35:25.34 --> 00:35:28.34 You're going to, you're going to college in Florida.
00:35:28.34 --> 00:35:29.34 Yeah.
00:35:29.34 --> 00:35:32.78 And I'm still hearing in touch with his sister.
00:35:32.78 --> 00:35:36.30 And we had, you know, we had email.
00:35:36.30 --> 00:35:38.90 So, you know, like the dial-up.
00:35:38.90 --> 00:35:43.34 I would do the dial-up email and check to see if you'd ever email me.
00:35:43.34 --> 00:35:45.34 And then all of a sudden one day he did.
00:35:45.34 --> 00:35:49.18 And he just said, I just, I told the guys, I keep thinking about you.
00:35:49.18 --> 00:35:50.70 And I want to see you.
00:35:50.70 --> 00:35:52.94 I was like, yes.
00:35:52.94 --> 00:35:53.94 So.
00:35:53.94 --> 00:35:55.94 So did he say come up to Virginia Beach and he comes down to Florida?
00:35:55.94 --> 00:35:56.94 No.
00:35:56.94 --> 00:35:59.34 I said, you know where I live?
00:35:59.34 --> 00:36:00.94 Well, first of all, he was still in deployment.
00:36:00.94 --> 00:36:02.18 He was quite home yet.
00:36:02.18 --> 00:36:03.18 And so I didn't know.
00:36:03.18 --> 00:36:04.02 And I'm in college.
00:36:04.02 --> 00:36:09.06 And yeah, he drove down and showed up at my doorstep.
00:36:09.06 --> 00:36:11.82 And I did the same thing.
00:36:11.82 --> 00:36:12.82 I did in high school.
00:36:12.82 --> 00:36:16.90 I just couldn't believe he was there, you know?
00:36:16.90 --> 00:36:19.74 And just excited.
00:36:19.74 --> 00:36:24.02 And we said to each other, I said to him before he comes, came down.
00:36:24.02 --> 00:36:26.78 If we see each other again, we're going to know.
00:36:26.78 --> 00:36:30.94 Like this is either going to be forever or it's just not.
00:36:30.94 --> 00:36:32.70 And he came down.
00:36:32.70 --> 00:36:36.06 And pretty much roll over herself when I went to Orlando and he asked me to stay
00:36:36.06 --> 00:36:37.22 in extra day.
00:36:37.22 --> 00:36:40.46 I said, do you think you could stay in extra day?
00:36:40.46 --> 00:36:41.46 And that was it.
00:36:41.46 --> 00:36:49.22 So that was the summer of 99, I think.
00:36:49.22 --> 00:36:50.38 May of 99.
00:36:50.38 --> 00:36:51.94 How old are you at this point?
00:36:51.94 --> 00:36:53.74 You're going to make me do bath.
00:36:53.74 --> 00:36:54.74 I don't know.
00:36:54.74 --> 00:36:55.74 I'm like, 29.
00:36:55.74 --> 00:36:57.18 So you're, oh yeah, you're in college.
00:36:57.18 --> 00:37:00.18 You're a young college girl.
00:37:00.18 --> 00:37:03.38 And he's swoops in.
00:37:03.38 --> 00:37:04.54 Yeah.
00:37:04.54 --> 00:37:07.14 And says, all right, we're going to do this.
00:37:07.14 --> 00:37:09.66 Yeah, I mean, did you drop out of college?
00:37:09.66 --> 00:37:10.26 So what'd you do?
00:37:10.26 --> 00:37:12.18 No, I stayed in college.
00:37:12.18 --> 00:37:13.98 You're slightly more responsible than that.
00:37:13.98 --> 00:37:14.98 Yeah, stayed in college.
00:37:18.26 --> 00:37:21.78 We, we got engaged that summer in July.
00:37:21.78 --> 00:37:26.86 We got married on paper as a lot of military people do.
00:37:26.86 --> 00:37:29.02 We've got married up in Virginia Beach
00:37:29.02 --> 00:37:31.54 in the, in the sky's backyard.
00:37:31.54 --> 00:37:35.46 And so we were at least married and had all that.
00:37:35.46 --> 00:37:39.34 And I spent time down in Florida.
00:37:39.34 --> 00:37:41.02 And then I worked it to graduate.
00:37:41.02 --> 00:37:44.98 I had to do an internship to finish my degree.
00:37:44.98 --> 00:37:48.98 So I got an internship with the city of Virginia Beach
00:37:48.98 --> 00:37:50.86 because I wanted to be where he was.
00:37:50.86 --> 00:37:53.66 So you guys, you, you get married.
00:37:53.66 --> 00:37:55.58 Well, he proposes to you.
00:37:55.58 --> 00:37:59.18 And then you get married the old school like what I did.
00:37:59.18 --> 00:38:01.18 My wife and I got married at the San Diego
00:38:01.18 --> 00:38:03.14 courthouse and my chief was like the wet
00:38:03.14 --> 00:38:04.58 because you have to bring a witness.
00:38:04.58 --> 00:38:07.18 So I was like, hey, can you come with witness
00:38:07.18 --> 00:38:08.02 my wedding?
00:38:08.02 --> 00:38:09.14 He's like, you're getting married?
00:38:09.14 --> 00:38:09.98 Yeah.
00:38:09.98 --> 00:38:11.22 OK, so we went down there.
00:38:11.22 --> 00:38:14.22 And this judge goes, all right, you two are married.
00:38:14.22 --> 00:38:16.02 And then we walked out and then we went to
00:38:16.02 --> 00:38:17.62 Danes and had a hamburger.
00:38:17.62 --> 00:38:19.06 That was the honeymoon.
00:38:19.06 --> 00:38:22.14 Oh, bad husband.
00:38:22.14 --> 00:38:22.94 But that's what we did.
00:38:22.94 --> 00:38:24.62 That's sort of, that's what you guys did, too.
00:38:24.62 --> 00:38:27.86 I mean, I think for me, that's a better story.
00:38:27.86 --> 00:38:28.38 Our story.
00:38:28.38 --> 00:38:30.30 We went and got married in this guy's backyard,
00:38:30.30 --> 00:38:31.22 nobody knew.
00:38:31.22 --> 00:38:32.86 We were living in a house with team guys.
00:38:32.86 --> 00:38:36.22 I was living with him and four other team guys in a house.
00:38:36.22 --> 00:38:37.74 It was just like that.
00:38:37.74 --> 00:38:38.54 That was a good guy.
00:38:38.54 --> 00:38:41.98 We can at Bernys, you know, just my poor wife,
00:38:41.98 --> 00:38:44.46 my poor wife did that, too.
00:38:44.46 --> 00:38:47.58 She, well, it wasn't 14 guys, but it was me.
00:38:47.58 --> 00:38:53.46 My running mate team guy roommate who is just the best guy
00:38:53.46 --> 00:38:56.54 ever and also just like you can say, we were all crazy.
00:38:56.54 --> 00:38:59.02 And then so we lived in the upstairs apartment
00:38:59.02 --> 00:39:01.26 and then two other team guys lived below us.
00:39:01.26 --> 00:39:04.10 And it was just, well, I'm sure it was very similar
00:39:04.10 --> 00:39:07.10 to the environment you were in.
00:39:07.10 --> 00:39:11.06 You know, like the furniture was cruise boxes.
00:39:11.06 --> 00:39:15.06 Dinner was dominoes, breakfast was Guinness.
00:39:15.06 --> 00:39:16.98 Lunch was Yager Meister.
00:39:16.98 --> 00:39:18.54 And it was just me.
00:39:18.54 --> 00:39:20.14 Yeah, Chas Brother likes to say,
00:39:20.14 --> 00:39:23.06 remember his coming to visit and he got out of the shower.
00:39:23.06 --> 00:39:24.34 And it was so disgusting.
00:39:24.34 --> 00:39:27.38 He just took a paper towel and like pat it his body dry
00:39:27.38 --> 00:39:29.66 because he didn't want to use anything.
00:39:29.66 --> 00:39:31.82 I mean, I don't know if it was that gross maybe for him.
00:39:31.82 --> 00:39:34.50 But, you know, it was due to house.
00:39:34.50 --> 00:39:36.62 And you know, I got to live there.
00:39:36.62 --> 00:39:42.10 And there was one giant sofa that was the ugliest
00:39:42.10 --> 00:39:42.98 Chad had bought it.
00:39:42.98 --> 00:39:45.06 It was a scanned and navy in print.
00:39:45.06 --> 00:39:46.90 It was the tackiest ugliest thing.
00:39:46.90 --> 00:39:49.86 And literally his entire life, he still talked about that
00:39:49.86 --> 00:39:51.30 stupid sofa.
00:39:51.30 --> 00:39:55.70 So my wife and I, but my old running mate,
00:39:55.70 --> 00:40:00.86 we had this freaking couch that was gold.
00:40:00.86 --> 00:40:02.58 I think it's called velvet velvet.
00:40:02.58 --> 00:40:04.86 Is that what it's called like this kind of like a
00:40:04.86 --> 00:40:06.94 like really soft push back and forth.
00:40:06.94 --> 00:40:08.26 So it was gold velvet.
00:40:08.26 --> 00:40:10.82 It had some kind of wood carvings at the end.
00:40:10.82 --> 00:40:15.82 It had to have been more than 10 feet long.
00:40:15.82 --> 00:40:17.70 It was freaking huge.
00:40:17.70 --> 00:40:18.54 We couldn't do this.
00:40:18.54 --> 00:40:19.38 Yeah.
00:40:19.38 --> 00:40:21.18 And it was the most comfortable couch ever.
00:40:21.18 --> 00:40:24.06 And I think we got it at a whatever a thrift store for
00:40:24.06 --> 00:40:27.14 whatever $38 or something, best couch ever.
00:40:27.14 --> 00:40:28.14 That's what he says.
00:40:28.14 --> 00:40:31.02 And we could fit like three to four full size dudes on it.
00:40:31.02 --> 00:40:32.10 I think it was more typical.
00:40:32.10 --> 00:40:34.06 We'd wake up and one of them would be on the sofa
00:40:34.06 --> 00:40:35.78 just because it was comfortable.
00:40:35.78 --> 00:40:39.10 And they, the house, it was, there was a sofa.
00:40:39.10 --> 00:40:40.10 And there was a calculator.
00:40:40.10 --> 00:40:40.94 Is it?
00:40:40.94 --> 00:40:44.94 And when I told him to put decorations up,
00:40:44.94 --> 00:40:46.54 I was like, you guys need stuff on the wall.
00:40:46.54 --> 00:40:47.82 They hung shooting targets.
00:40:47.82 --> 00:40:52.70 Like the real ones, the pictures, the man on the woman,
00:40:52.70 --> 00:40:53.54 you have on the side.
00:40:53.54 --> 00:40:54.34 Does he have a weapon?
00:40:54.34 --> 00:40:56.10 Does not do a shoot him.
00:40:56.10 --> 00:40:58.94 That was when I froze in our house for a little while.
00:40:58.94 --> 00:40:59.94 Yeah.
00:40:59.94 --> 00:41:04.70 So you got like a heart of really nice welcome to the team community.
00:41:04.70 --> 00:41:05.42 It was.
00:41:05.42 --> 00:41:06.42 Yeah.
00:41:06.42 --> 00:41:10.38 It was such a different life back then.
00:41:10.38 --> 00:41:11.38 Yeah.
00:41:11.38 --> 00:41:15.02 And you go and out with the boys, like when my wife came over
00:41:15.02 --> 00:41:17.22 and we weren't married yet, but when she,
00:41:17.22 --> 00:41:19.54 when we started, which started living with me,
00:41:19.54 --> 00:41:22.50 she would like come out with us, you know, and hang.
00:41:22.50 --> 00:41:27.06 Oh yeah, we'd go out and burn it down.
00:41:27.06 --> 00:41:29.78 I, for, you know, I'm in Virginia Beach.
00:41:29.78 --> 00:41:31.22 And there's this bar that's been there forever.
00:41:31.22 --> 00:41:31.98 Hot tuna.
00:41:31.98 --> 00:41:33.02 They've since read done it.
00:41:33.02 --> 00:41:33.86 But it's hot.
00:41:33.86 --> 00:41:34.70 Hot tuna.
00:41:34.70 --> 00:41:36.90 I just went back literally like two weeks ago
00:41:36.90 --> 00:41:37.70 for the first time.
00:41:37.70 --> 00:41:39.98 And I thought I haven't been here in forever.
00:41:39.98 --> 00:41:42.02 And it took me back to a one night in particular,
00:41:42.02 --> 00:41:44.10 Chad drove a green Jeep Cherokee.
00:41:44.10 --> 00:41:46.62 Still was favorite car, always.
00:41:46.62 --> 00:41:49.38 And we went out with a bunch of guys.
00:41:49.38 --> 00:41:51.86 And we just lifted up the back gate,
00:41:51.86 --> 00:41:53.18 you know, and just shoved them in there.
00:41:53.18 --> 00:41:55.46 Instead of actually, you know, this is a one time go
00:41:55.46 --> 00:41:57.14 for get the seat belt shoving there.
00:41:57.14 --> 00:41:58.02 We went hot tuna.
00:41:58.02 --> 00:41:59.82 Sure enough, there was a fight.
00:41:59.82 --> 00:42:01.78 We got kicked out, told to leave.
00:42:01.78 --> 00:42:03.94 And I just remember running out there,
00:42:03.94 --> 00:42:05.06 throwing up the back gate.
00:42:05.06 --> 00:42:07.66 The guys getting in and we're out.
00:42:09.10 --> 00:42:11.34 And this lifestyle to you, what were you thinking?
00:42:11.34 --> 00:42:14.22 We were like, okay, well, this is the way it is.
00:42:14.22 --> 00:42:17.42 Yeah, I don't even think I thought anything.
00:42:17.42 --> 00:42:19.34 I just was in it.
00:42:19.34 --> 00:42:22.62 And you're military and military kid.
00:42:22.62 --> 00:42:26.18 And you understand just the camaraderie
00:42:26.18 --> 00:42:30.26 that can happen there and the sense of family
00:42:30.26 --> 00:42:31.54 that it can create.
00:42:32.62 --> 00:42:34.66 And I was really happy.
00:42:34.66 --> 00:42:38.94 And I think he was too to have made it to be a team guy.
00:42:38.94 --> 00:42:40.02 He was at teammate.
00:42:40.02 --> 00:42:42.18 Yeah.
00:42:42.18 --> 00:42:47.18 Yeah, I don't know if there's anything better
00:42:50.26 --> 00:42:53.82 than being an E5 in a seal put to.
00:42:53.82 --> 00:42:55.50 It's just freaking awesome.
00:42:55.50 --> 00:42:56.70 And it's everything you just said.
00:42:56.70 --> 00:42:59.42 Well, we had a big wedding later, right?
00:42:59.42 --> 00:43:01.38 So we had a big, I think for our family,
00:43:01.38 --> 00:43:03.34 they wanted like the bigger wedding.
00:43:03.34 --> 00:43:08.34 So in May of now we're gonna go to 2000, I guess.
00:43:08.34 --> 00:43:10.46 We got married.
00:43:10.46 --> 00:43:13.34 And so the boys all decided they were gonna come
00:43:13.34 --> 00:43:18.34 and they rented an RV and they drove from Virginia Beach
00:43:18.34 --> 00:43:20.90 to where we got married.
00:43:20.90 --> 00:43:23.94 And all my girlfriends from college had come
00:43:23.94 --> 00:43:27.34 and they were, you know, don't ask a dumb question.
00:43:27.34 --> 00:43:30.34 They were in the perception and you look around the room
00:43:30.34 --> 00:43:31.70 and there's one huge round table
00:43:31.70 --> 00:43:33.58 with all these really good looking dudes around it.
00:43:33.58 --> 00:43:35.74 And they grow so like, I think that's the Navy seals.
00:43:35.74 --> 00:43:37.74 Not only are they like a bunch of dudes
00:43:37.74 --> 00:43:38.58 and they're good looking.
00:43:38.58 --> 00:43:41.34 And couple of them had like a butterfly stitch on his forehead
00:43:41.34 --> 00:43:44.22 because they stopped in Savannah on that and bar fight.
00:43:44.22 --> 00:43:46.46 So it was like so appropriate, you know?
00:43:46.46 --> 00:43:47.30 It was good.
00:43:49.42 --> 00:43:51.62 When once you moved to Virginia Beach,
00:43:51.62 --> 00:43:53.14 he must've been in a workup.
00:43:53.14 --> 00:43:54.42 When did he go into employment?
00:43:56.06 --> 00:43:57.30 That's when I started to forget.
00:43:57.30 --> 00:43:59.02 So he's already done one to point him
00:43:59.02 --> 00:44:00.14 and he's on the ship.
00:44:00.14 --> 00:44:03.50 And then he comes back and then he did two more there.
00:44:04.50 --> 00:44:05.94 I honestly can't remember the months.
00:44:05.94 --> 00:44:10.14 And so he's going on to point for the first time
00:44:10.14 --> 00:44:11.74 or the first time that you're married.
00:44:11.74 --> 00:44:13.74 So it is, I guess it'd be his second appointment.
00:44:13.74 --> 00:44:14.58 Yeah.
00:44:14.58 --> 00:44:17.14 And now you're like, what did you just say in Virginia Beach
00:44:17.14 --> 00:44:19.14 did you go?
00:44:19.14 --> 00:44:22.46 So this was like I had to do the whole,
00:44:23.38 --> 00:44:25.70 I live there, I did my internship
00:44:25.70 --> 00:44:28.02 and we got really married for real.
00:44:28.02 --> 00:44:30.10 And oh, that's right, because he did deploy
00:44:30.10 --> 00:44:35.10 and I moved back home with my family during that second appointment.
00:44:35.10 --> 00:44:37.78 We were in the middle of like not living anywhere.
00:44:37.78 --> 00:44:39.14 So we lived with the team guys.
00:44:39.14 --> 00:44:41.66 We had our own apartment for a little while.
00:44:41.66 --> 00:44:44.06 And which was also one of the greatest times
00:44:44.06 --> 00:44:46.14 because you don't realize it at the time
00:44:46.14 --> 00:44:48.42 when you're young and you have no money
00:44:48.42 --> 00:44:52.62 and you live in an apartment I think it was $425 a month.
00:44:52.62 --> 00:44:55.50 Pleasure House Road, Shore Drive, Chicks Beach,
00:44:55.50 --> 00:44:57.26 like where everything goes down.
00:44:57.26 --> 00:44:58.62 Just how great that is.
00:44:58.62 --> 00:45:02.98 Who have nothing and you kind of need nothing.
00:45:02.98 --> 00:45:04.26 It's such simplicity.
00:45:04.26 --> 00:45:06.62 So anyway, we moved out of that apartment.
00:45:06.62 --> 00:45:07.90 He left on deployment.
00:45:07.90 --> 00:45:09.26 I went back home to stay with my family.
00:45:09.26 --> 00:45:12.54 What do you mean when you're living that little apartment?
00:45:12.54 --> 00:45:14.90 You know, like what makes that so good?
00:45:17.22 --> 00:45:19.50 I mean, there's nothing to take care of.
00:45:19.50 --> 00:45:20.50 It's an apartment.
00:45:21.50 --> 00:45:26.02 Our friend Lance Vicaro, who passed away in 2008,
00:45:26.02 --> 00:45:27.46 he lived in the same complex.
00:45:27.46 --> 00:45:29.62 So you should the shit with him when you see him.
00:45:29.62 --> 00:45:33.46 And yeah, just like making dinner and eating it on
00:45:33.46 --> 00:45:34.62 that we had a cruise box.
00:45:34.62 --> 00:45:36.90 One of those metal folding collapsible ones.
00:45:36.90 --> 00:45:37.74 Remember those?
00:45:37.74 --> 00:45:38.58 Oh yeah.
00:45:38.58 --> 00:45:39.26 That was our coffee table.
00:45:39.26 --> 00:45:42.02 He just put a little like table cloth over it.
00:45:42.02 --> 00:45:43.30 We'd eat there.
00:45:43.30 --> 00:45:45.66 I was like cooking meals in a crock pot.
00:45:45.66 --> 00:45:46.98 Terrible.
00:45:46.98 --> 00:45:48.98 Me and my buddy had a cruise box that we had,
00:45:48.98 --> 00:45:51.94 like by the big gold couch, we had a cruise box
00:45:51.94 --> 00:45:53.30 that had the phone on it.
00:45:53.30 --> 00:45:55.90 And then on the cruise box was in Sharpie,
00:45:55.90 --> 00:45:58.06 was written everyone's numbers from the different
00:45:58.06 --> 00:46:00.78 tunes and like the T-Merry number.
00:46:00.78 --> 00:46:02.66 Yeah, those are good times.
00:46:02.66 --> 00:46:06.90 I was talking also about the, as you advance in life
00:46:08.10 --> 00:46:11.06 when you get an apartment, that's like step one.
00:46:11.06 --> 00:46:13.50 But then when you get an apartment that has,
00:46:13.50 --> 00:46:14.46 tell them my kids this,
00:46:14.46 --> 00:46:17.82 when you get an apartment that has a washer and dryer,
00:46:17.82 --> 00:46:20.46 like on-site, and that's a big deal.
00:46:20.46 --> 00:46:22.66 And then if you have one that has parking,
00:46:22.66 --> 00:46:24.74 that's like the next big step up in life.
00:46:24.74 --> 00:46:25.58 Yeah, yeah.
00:46:25.58 --> 00:46:27.38 Those things are, those things bring you joy
00:46:27.38 --> 00:46:28.74 when you're young and broke.
00:46:28.74 --> 00:46:29.58 Yeah.
00:46:29.58 --> 00:46:31.42 I've driven by that apartment a few times
00:46:31.42 --> 00:46:32.98 in the last two years,
00:46:32.98 --> 00:46:35.14 and all the places we've lived in Virginia Beach, you know.
00:46:36.34 --> 00:46:39.14 Okay, so you do the big wedding.
00:46:39.14 --> 00:46:39.98 Yep.
00:46:39.98 --> 00:46:42.54 And all these, your girlfriends are there from college.
00:46:42.54 --> 00:46:44.34 There's a bunch of team guys there.
00:46:44.34 --> 00:46:46.50 That sounds like an awesome time.
00:46:46.50 --> 00:46:49.82 And then he's going on to play me again.
00:46:51.02 --> 00:46:55.02 Yeah, so he, we get married.
00:46:55.86 --> 00:46:57.62 He goes on deployment.
00:46:58.62 --> 00:47:00.86 I think before he left on deployment
00:47:00.86 --> 00:47:03.70 is when I found out I was pregnant.
00:47:03.70 --> 00:47:04.54 Mm-hmm.
00:47:04.54 --> 00:47:05.38 Okay.
00:47:05.38 --> 00:47:06.18 Yeah, which was another reason
00:47:06.18 --> 00:47:07.38 they like took me home.
00:47:07.38 --> 00:47:08.22 Okay.
00:47:08.22 --> 00:47:10.18 So we weren't planning it,
00:47:10.18 --> 00:47:11.58 but we weren't not planning it.
00:47:11.58 --> 00:47:12.94 It was kind of like, you know,
00:47:12.94 --> 00:47:14.14 we've been together forever.
00:47:14.14 --> 00:47:16.22 And it is what it is.
00:47:16.22 --> 00:47:17.86 So, so you get pregnant.
00:47:19.10 --> 00:47:20.22 He goes on deployment.
00:47:20.22 --> 00:47:21.06 Yeah.
00:47:21.06 --> 00:47:22.42 You go home to,
00:47:22.42 --> 00:47:23.26 Florida.
00:47:23.26 --> 00:47:24.86 Okay, you're home to Florida.
00:47:24.86 --> 00:47:27.78 And you're living, you know,
00:47:27.78 --> 00:47:29.18 doing whatever you're doing.
00:47:29.18 --> 00:47:33.94 Yeah, and this again was before we didn't have cell phones.
00:47:33.94 --> 00:47:35.38 So, you know, this,
00:47:36.38 --> 00:47:39.10 it's interesting when people are like upset
00:47:39.10 --> 00:47:40.98 because they didn't get to like face time
00:47:40.98 --> 00:47:43.98 what there has been on deployment in today's world, right?
00:47:43.98 --> 00:47:45.74 Because I would miss phone calls.
00:47:45.74 --> 00:47:47.62 And then you don't know when he's going to call you again.
00:47:47.62 --> 00:47:50.46 And we have so many letters he wrote me.
00:47:50.46 --> 00:47:51.78 I'm pretty grateful for that.
00:47:51.78 --> 00:47:52.94 And so I'm in Florida.
00:47:52.94 --> 00:47:54.22 He's deployed.
00:47:54.22 --> 00:47:55.74 Trying to talk to him when I can.
00:47:55.74 --> 00:47:59.54 Go on a baby in my belly and all the things.
00:48:00.54 --> 00:48:01.70 And they come home.
00:48:01.70 --> 00:48:03.50 When did you have the baby while he was on the plunder?
00:48:03.50 --> 00:48:04.38 Did he come home in time?
00:48:04.38 --> 00:48:05.34 Yeah, he came home.
00:48:05.34 --> 00:48:08.38 So, because I was like super newly pregnant when he left.
00:48:10.06 --> 00:48:12.78 So, we know what we're still staying in Virginia Beach.
00:48:12.78 --> 00:48:15.26 So, I go up to Virginia Beach.
00:48:15.26 --> 00:48:18.58 Super pregnant with my mom and buy our first house.
00:48:18.58 --> 00:48:19.82 So, while he's gone.
00:48:19.82 --> 00:48:20.66 So, we.
00:48:20.66 --> 00:48:21.50 Yeah.
00:48:21.50 --> 00:48:24.98 And then he came home from deployment.
00:48:24.98 --> 00:48:27.70 May 2001.
00:48:27.70 --> 00:48:30.26 And my daughter was born in August.
00:48:30.26 --> 00:48:32.70 And now he's still at teammate.
00:48:32.70 --> 00:48:34.42 He's done two deployments.
00:48:34.42 --> 00:48:36.54 And yeah.
00:48:36.54 --> 00:48:41.06 And it's your daughter was born in August of 2001.
00:48:41.06 --> 00:48:42.06 Mm-hmm.
00:48:42.06 --> 00:48:44.06 And he's in another platoon at this point?
00:48:44.06 --> 00:48:45.06 Yeah.
00:48:45.06 --> 00:48:47.34 And he.
00:48:47.34 --> 00:48:49.98 So, he gets there as deployments.
00:48:49.98 --> 00:48:54.46 And for the rest of his time there, he goes to night school.
00:48:54.46 --> 00:48:56.34 Because he's trying to finish his degree.
00:48:56.34 --> 00:48:58.58 So, he finishes his degree at ODU.
00:48:58.58 --> 00:49:00.10 We have a new baby.
00:49:00.10 --> 00:49:03.86 And then he finishes his time.
00:49:03.86 --> 00:49:04.94 He was at trade-et.
00:49:04.94 --> 00:49:05.94 Okay.
00:49:05.94 --> 00:49:09.42 So, we're just like a young family, you know.
00:49:09.42 --> 00:49:11.10 When September 11 happens.
00:49:11.10 --> 00:49:13.86 So, is he at trade-et when September 11 happens?
00:49:15.62 --> 00:49:18.78 He was at, ah.
00:49:19.90 --> 00:49:21.50 Yeah, I think he might have been, actually.
00:49:21.50 --> 00:49:22.50 Yeah.
00:49:22.50 --> 00:49:24.42 And so September 11 happens.
00:49:24.42 --> 00:49:26.22 Now, what are you thinking?
00:49:26.22 --> 00:49:28.46 Ah, that's such crazy.
00:49:28.46 --> 00:49:33.54 Everyone remembers where they were when that happened.
00:49:33.54 --> 00:49:39.10 I don't even think I have the ability to think about it in the scope of the military.
00:49:39.10 --> 00:49:43.10 And what the military was going to do or our country was going to do to react.
00:49:43.10 --> 00:49:45.46 I just was dumbfounded.
00:49:45.46 --> 00:49:46.78 Keep trying to call them at work.
00:49:46.78 --> 00:49:48.06 Couldn't get a hold of them.
00:49:48.06 --> 00:49:50.26 He eventually showed up at the house.
00:49:50.26 --> 00:49:54.82 And we just kind of looked at each other and he's like, holy shit.
00:49:54.82 --> 00:50:01.50 So, and at that point, did you, was he like, okay, I'm going to go back on deployment?
00:50:01.50 --> 00:50:04.82 Was he, what was his plan at that point?
00:50:06.82 --> 00:50:09.78 I mean, I think his plan was to just stay.
00:50:09.78 --> 00:50:15.70 He, at that point, I think he always wanted to just be a career seal.
00:50:15.70 --> 00:50:17.50 So, whatever was going to keep him in the game.
00:50:17.50 --> 00:50:22.58 Quite honestly, we had a conversation after a deployment that he wanted to go to Damneck.
00:50:22.58 --> 00:50:27.34 And I was like, no.
00:50:27.34 --> 00:50:30.38 And I don't even know why I said no.
00:50:30.38 --> 00:50:31.66 I never said no.
00:50:31.66 --> 00:50:35.22 I always like supported him and encouraged him and pushed him.
00:50:35.22 --> 00:50:39.02 But for some reason at that point, I didn't want him to go.
00:50:39.02 --> 00:50:42.42 I don't know how it would have turned out if he would have gone then.
00:50:42.42 --> 00:50:51.06 But yeah, so he stayed in the military, but then, because in all this, when he came home
00:50:51.06 --> 00:50:57.70 from that last deployment, I got pregnant with our son or his third deployment at eight.
00:50:57.70 --> 00:51:00.30 And that was when.
00:51:00.30 --> 00:51:05.06 So, 2001, but fast forward, you know, we're in 2004.
00:51:05.06 --> 00:51:14.10 And I think we both kind of, well, I would say it's more me, we wanted something different.
00:51:14.10 --> 00:51:15.58 So Chad wanted to be a seal.
00:51:15.58 --> 00:51:17.30 He always wanted to be a door kicker.
00:51:17.30 --> 00:51:20.58 That's what he wanted to do, you know, hide in the bushes and do all the things.
00:51:20.58 --> 00:51:25.94 And as military kids, I was really trying to do something different.
00:51:25.94 --> 00:51:28.10 And the grass is greener on the other side, right?
00:51:28.10 --> 00:51:31.34 I moved all the time and I didn't want my kids to have to move all the time.
00:51:31.34 --> 00:51:34.18 And I didn't want their dad to be gone all the time.
00:51:34.18 --> 00:51:37.34 We talked about it and we were making the decision to get out of the military.
00:51:37.34 --> 00:51:40.42 So he had been in 10 years at this point.
00:51:40.42 --> 00:51:43.02 And it's 2004.
00:51:43.02 --> 00:51:44.62 His son is born.
00:51:44.62 --> 00:51:48.26 He wrapped up that last deployment.
00:51:48.26 --> 00:51:50.82 And we got out and moved to Raleigh, North Carolina.
00:51:50.82 --> 00:51:52.62 Do you know where he went?
00:51:52.62 --> 00:51:55.02 No, did he go to Iraq, Raff Ganeson on that deployment?
00:51:55.02 --> 00:51:57.78 Or did he do a different deployment like over to you, Com, or something?
00:51:57.78 --> 00:52:02.70 Uh, I should know these statistics and facts better, but I don't.
00:52:02.70 --> 00:52:04.62 I mean, I'm like 23 with a baby.
00:52:04.62 --> 00:52:05.62 Yeah.
00:52:05.62 --> 00:52:09.26 Well, this would be very similar to asking my wife what I went on to point to you.
00:52:09.26 --> 00:52:10.74 Like I had no idea he was gone.
00:52:10.74 --> 00:52:12.66 That was my wife's attitude too.
00:52:12.66 --> 00:52:13.66 Yeah.
00:52:13.66 --> 00:52:14.66 He's gone.
00:52:14.66 --> 00:52:15.66 He'll be back later.
00:52:15.66 --> 00:52:16.66 Yeah.
00:52:16.66 --> 00:52:21.70 So you all make this decision to get out.
00:52:21.70 --> 00:52:22.70 Right.
00:52:22.70 --> 00:52:24.46 And then what's the plan?
00:52:24.46 --> 00:52:29.74 So at that point, his family's now living in Raleigh, North Carolina.
00:52:29.74 --> 00:52:32.70 And he has his college degree.
00:52:32.70 --> 00:52:36.50 He's done 10 years in the military and he thinks, okay, I'm going to get out and I'm going
00:52:36.50 --> 00:52:39.98 to provide for my family and a civilian world.
00:52:39.98 --> 00:52:40.98 And that's what we did.
00:52:40.98 --> 00:52:42.42 And he got a job in pharmaceuticals.
00:52:42.42 --> 00:52:45.26 You know, there's a lot of research there.
00:52:45.26 --> 00:52:50.10 Um, kind of irony in that when I'm sitting here thinking about him and his life and the
00:52:50.10 --> 00:52:51.26 path that he chose.
00:52:51.26 --> 00:52:59.70 But he was in pharmaceutical research and we just hated it from moment we left.
00:52:59.70 --> 00:53:02.74 I think most people are creatures of habit.
00:53:02.74 --> 00:53:03.94 It's my belief, right?
00:53:03.94 --> 00:53:07.18 People are creatures of habit whether you like that habit or you don't like the habit.
00:53:07.18 --> 00:53:08.74 It's, it just is what it is.
00:53:08.74 --> 00:53:12.30 And our habit is that we are military kids.
00:53:12.30 --> 00:53:19.18 We are used to adversity and challenge and changing dynamics on the regular.
00:53:19.18 --> 00:53:25.70 We're used to different situations and the idea of living in the same house, doing the same
00:53:25.70 --> 00:53:29.66 job with the same people for the rest of your life is nauseating.
00:53:29.66 --> 00:53:32.90 And I don't think it was challenging for him.
00:53:32.90 --> 00:53:38.50 And while he did one of his last jumps with the guys before he left, the guys jumped out
00:53:38.50 --> 00:53:41.26 of the plane and they're like, you're not going to do this with your pharmaceutical
00:53:41.26 --> 00:53:49.34 dudes, you know, and I think that always bugged him.
00:53:49.34 --> 00:53:56.70 And I think like most of these guys, they don't want to feel like they quit, I guess.
00:53:56.70 --> 00:54:02.54 And for Chad anyway, separating from the military and not retiring, he probably felt like
00:54:02.54 --> 00:54:04.30 he wasn't finished.
00:54:04.30 --> 00:54:05.94 And I felt that too because he was miserable.
00:54:05.94 --> 00:54:06.94 He was miserable.
00:54:06.94 --> 00:54:10.86 How long did it take for buyers to set in?
00:54:10.86 --> 00:54:13.86 Like when you get to North Carolina, was there any sort of like honey mood period?
00:54:13.86 --> 00:54:16.50 Hey, we can go on a picnic today and we don't have to worry about anything.
00:54:16.50 --> 00:54:17.50 Oh yeah, yeah.
00:54:17.50 --> 00:54:18.50 How long did that last?
00:54:18.50 --> 00:54:24.10 I mean, I think it lasted for about a year, even though I think in the back of our
00:54:24.10 --> 00:54:26.62 minds, we'd lay in bed and we're like, he'd say,
00:54:26.62 --> 00:54:27.62 what are we doing?
00:54:27.62 --> 00:54:28.62 What are we doing?
00:54:28.62 --> 00:54:30.62 Like, how do they get real?
00:54:30.62 --> 00:54:36.46 Yeah, at night, you know, but then it's like, okay, we're doing it, though, because
00:54:36.46 --> 00:54:39.14 because at the same time, you see it as a challenge in some ways.
00:54:39.14 --> 00:54:43.94 You're like, and I doubting myself because I want to go back or my doubting myself, because
00:54:43.94 --> 00:54:46.90 now I just have this new challenge and I got to like overcome it.
00:54:46.90 --> 00:54:49.46 What was he doing for the pharmaceutical company?
00:54:49.46 --> 00:54:56.30 He was a project manager and I think he was I candy for all the girls and off.
00:54:56.30 --> 00:55:01.30 I know this because my sister in law works in the field too and she would tell me stories,
00:55:01.30 --> 00:55:11.82 but yeah, he tell, I just, he said to me, he came home and he's like Sarah, I was
00:55:11.82 --> 00:55:18.82 sitting in the break room today, celebrating a baby shower, eating a pink, fucking cupcake,
00:55:18.82 --> 00:55:20.90 and I'm questioning my life.
00:55:20.90 --> 00:55:24.18 And you're like, okay, I don't think this is going to work.
00:55:24.18 --> 00:55:30.38 And as cool as it is to have him home every day and he had a good job, we made good
00:55:30.38 --> 00:55:31.74 money, the American dream.
00:55:31.74 --> 00:55:35.30 I mean, our house had a wrap around porch, no joke.
00:55:35.30 --> 00:55:36.30 The picket fence.
00:55:36.30 --> 00:55:42.30 I mean, by most standards, I don't even know if that's fair to say any more in today's
00:55:42.30 --> 00:55:49.02 world, but it was the quote American dream, but it was not our dream.
00:55:49.02 --> 00:55:51.94 How far into it was the cupcake incident?
00:55:51.94 --> 00:55:52.94 Was that like two months into it?
00:55:52.94 --> 00:55:53.94 No, that was closer to the other.
00:55:53.94 --> 00:55:55.82 Those are towards that and that was probably about two years.
00:55:55.82 --> 00:55:58.02 That was like the cupcake that broke the camel's back.
00:55:58.02 --> 00:55:59.02 Totally.
00:55:59.02 --> 00:56:01.22 Pink cupcake broke them.
00:56:01.22 --> 00:56:06.18 I think it just was a real pivot point and this isn't to bash cupcakes or baby showers
00:56:06.18 --> 00:56:13.86 or any of those things, but he's just a dude, you know?
00:56:13.86 --> 00:56:15.50 He's a military dude.
00:56:15.50 --> 00:56:20.58 He's a knife-carrying, you know, dude.
00:56:20.58 --> 00:56:27.86 And for him to put on a business suit in a tie every day, you just, people shouldn't be
00:56:27.86 --> 00:56:31.62 things they're not and that's not who he was.
00:56:31.62 --> 00:56:36.26 So what was the total time that he made it in the pharmaceutical?
00:56:36.26 --> 00:56:44.18 So he left the military in 2004 and we were back in the military September of 2007.
00:56:44.18 --> 00:56:46.82 So like two and a half, two and a half years.
00:56:46.82 --> 00:56:47.82 Yeah.
00:56:47.82 --> 00:56:53.18 When he, like, okay, so he comes home from the cupcake incident, or you just like,
00:56:53.18 --> 00:56:56.66 you can see the misery in his face and you're like, all right, I'm good.
00:56:56.66 --> 00:56:57.66 Let's go.
00:56:57.66 --> 00:56:58.66 Yeah.
00:56:58.66 --> 00:56:59.66 Yeah.
00:56:59.66 --> 00:57:06.50 I, that, we also, I mean, I remember being in the living room and hearing about red wings
00:57:06.50 --> 00:57:12.26 and I was sitting in the living room and watching it on TV and just, him just, you know,
00:57:12.26 --> 00:57:16.38 he was just sitting there, kind of had his hands on his head and he was totally shit.
00:57:16.38 --> 00:57:21.26 I think that probably had a large part, even though we didn't come back for some time,
00:57:21.26 --> 00:57:24.38 I think those things weighed on him.
00:57:24.38 --> 00:57:25.82 The way the world was changing.
00:57:25.82 --> 00:57:26.82 It was ramping up.
00:57:26.82 --> 00:57:29.94 We're now a couple years past 9.11.
00:57:29.94 --> 00:57:34.30 He, he felt called to go back.
00:57:34.30 --> 00:57:40.22 Then he makes a phone call, talk to like some guy or whatever and team guy recruiter or something.
00:57:40.22 --> 00:57:41.22 Yeah.
00:57:41.22 --> 00:57:42.94 We didn't really know how that was going to play out, right?
00:57:42.94 --> 00:57:45.90 I mean, they could have just said, no, you left.
00:57:45.90 --> 00:57:51.22 But I think at the time, you know, he, you know, he was a team guy that done a few deployments.
00:57:51.22 --> 00:57:53.98 He had good service, respected.
00:57:53.98 --> 00:57:55.30 They said sure.
00:57:55.30 --> 00:58:00.22 But they told him because he hadn't deployed in, you know, almost three years.
00:58:00.22 --> 00:58:04.38 He had to go back through, um, oh, S-t-t.
00:58:04.38 --> 00:58:06.14 Well, it was S-t-t when he graduated.
00:58:06.14 --> 00:58:07.14 Yeah.
00:58:07.14 --> 00:58:08.14 S-t-t-t.
00:58:08.14 --> 00:58:09.14 S-t-t-t.
00:58:09.14 --> 00:58:10.14 Yeah.
00:58:10.14 --> 00:58:13.14 So, we, I mean, he left for work one day.
00:58:13.14 --> 00:58:14.14 He had talked to this guy.
00:58:14.14 --> 00:58:16.74 He was kind of figuring out if this was going to work or not.
00:58:16.74 --> 00:58:17.94 And he left for work one day.
00:58:17.94 --> 00:58:22.66 And I just said, his tie and his suit and all of the, I said, this is stupid.
00:58:22.66 --> 00:58:30.46 We got to go back and we sold our house and he signed up to go back and we sold a lot
00:58:30.46 --> 00:58:32.38 of what we owned.
00:58:32.38 --> 00:58:36.18 And because there was no need to have it, we were going to move to California.
00:58:36.18 --> 00:58:39.70 He said if he had to go back to their S-t-t again, he wanted to just go to a West Coast
00:58:39.70 --> 00:58:43.66 team, um, just so we could all be out there together.
00:58:43.66 --> 00:58:51.10 And we put a little bit of things in a U-hall and the kids and I flew out to San Diego.
00:58:51.10 --> 00:58:52.82 And I had never been there.
00:58:52.82 --> 00:58:56.86 Oh, I came out and like house-hunted, try to find an apartment for us a couple weeks prior,
00:58:56.86 --> 00:58:59.78 but other than that, I hadn't really spent any time out here.
00:58:59.78 --> 00:59:05.42 And he drove a U-hall across country, chowing down on some flower seeds and just going
00:59:05.42 --> 00:59:13.34 like 90 and like, you know, jacked up on caffeine and got there.
00:59:13.34 --> 00:59:14.74 Then where did you guys move into?
00:59:14.74 --> 00:59:15.74 Did you guys move to Coronado?
00:59:15.74 --> 00:59:16.74 Yeah.
00:59:16.74 --> 00:59:20.26 We found this cool little, I just got lucky, found this cool little apartment.
00:59:20.26 --> 00:59:22.54 Same thing, kind of like our first apartment.
00:59:22.54 --> 00:59:26.58 It, I mean, this place can be more than 800 square feet.
00:59:26.58 --> 00:59:29.66 It was two bedrooms, one bathroom.
00:59:29.66 --> 00:59:35.50 It was our entire B-A-H, maybe even a little bit more, and our kids shared a room.
00:59:35.50 --> 00:59:38.26 Did you say you had been to San Diego before or you had not?
00:59:38.26 --> 00:59:43.70 I had only come out like a week or two before to try to find a place to live.
00:59:43.70 --> 00:59:47.14 What were you thinking when you drove from San Diego over the Coronado Bay Bridge and you
00:59:47.14 --> 00:59:48.14 see Coronado first?
00:59:48.14 --> 00:59:50.74 I was flipping my live.
00:59:50.74 --> 00:59:53.54 I just was like, yes, amazing.
00:59:53.54 --> 00:59:56.90 It's one of the craziest sites I think.
00:59:56.90 --> 01:00:00.02 Were you bringing anyone to San Diego and you going to Coronado and you drive over the
01:00:00.02 --> 01:00:01.70 bridge and you just see Coronado?
01:00:01.70 --> 01:00:02.70 Yeah.
01:00:02.70 --> 01:00:03.70 It's ridiculous.
01:00:03.70 --> 01:00:04.70 It is.
01:00:04.70 --> 01:00:05.70 It's ridiculous.
01:00:05.70 --> 01:00:11.70 I've spent most of my youth on the East Coast and almost always close to a beach.
01:00:11.70 --> 01:00:14.34 I always, you know, I don't want to live more than 30 minutes from a beach.
01:00:14.34 --> 01:00:15.34 Let's be honest.
01:00:15.34 --> 01:00:21.06 So the fact that I could flip coast and live here and on Coronado is, yeah.
01:00:21.06 --> 01:00:22.94 And there's the mosquitoes here.
01:00:22.94 --> 01:00:29.30 I had the friend coming out and him and his wife and like it was getting to be dusk.
01:00:29.30 --> 01:00:31.02 And they were like, oh, the mosquitoes are going to call him.
01:00:31.02 --> 01:00:32.02 Like there's no mosquitoes here.
01:00:32.02 --> 01:00:33.02 They didn't believe me.
01:00:33.02 --> 01:00:34.02 They didn't believe.
01:00:34.02 --> 01:00:35.02 They didn't believe.
01:00:35.02 --> 01:00:37.94 And you're talking about how could there be no mosquitoes?
01:00:37.94 --> 01:00:40.14 It's totally crazy.
01:00:40.14 --> 01:00:42.34 So now you're living in Coronado.
01:00:42.34 --> 01:00:43.34 Yeah.
01:00:43.34 --> 01:00:48.42 Kind of living the dream, taking bikes around the sidewalk, walking to get coffee and
01:00:48.42 --> 01:00:49.42 all that stuff.
01:00:49.42 --> 01:00:50.42 Oh, yeah.
01:00:50.42 --> 01:00:55.50 I got a rad little beach cruiser, chatbot me and kids were little and my son learned
01:00:55.50 --> 01:00:58.38 to ride a two-wheeler at two.
01:00:58.38 --> 01:01:02.34 And he had this little mini bike and we made friends with the guy in the bike shop and
01:01:02.34 --> 01:01:05.54 his name's my son's Hudson and Hudson would ride in the bike shop on Monday.
01:01:05.54 --> 01:01:08.98 The guy's like, hey, little man, come here and he swapped out.
01:01:08.98 --> 01:01:10.50 I should show you a picture of this.
01:01:10.50 --> 01:01:13.50 He swapped out at the handlebars of his bike for a-pangers.
01:01:13.50 --> 01:01:14.50 Oh, dang.
01:01:14.50 --> 01:01:17.70 So he just like he turned three and he was a three year old with this like little
01:01:17.70 --> 01:01:20.10 mini bike and he's a pay-panger handlebars.
01:01:20.10 --> 01:01:22.46 That's great.
01:01:22.46 --> 01:01:24.58 And chat's going to ask you tea this time.
01:01:24.58 --> 01:01:26.66 So ask you tea just serve on those.
01:01:26.66 --> 01:01:29.34 When you get done with buds, you go.
01:01:29.34 --> 01:01:33.70 You graduate from buds and after buds they start to teach you some stuff in this thing called
01:01:33.70 --> 01:01:34.70 that's QT.
01:01:34.70 --> 01:01:38.98 You don't really learn anything in buds other than how to go through suffering and then
01:01:38.98 --> 01:01:44.30 you get to ask you tea and they start teaching you like all the fundamental basic individual
01:01:44.30 --> 01:01:47.22 skills of being a seal at a higher level.
01:01:47.22 --> 01:01:50.26 And occasionally like Chad's a perfect example.
01:01:50.26 --> 01:01:54.58 Guys, guys out for three years, hey, we got new radios.
01:01:54.58 --> 01:01:56.58 We need, we can't just throw them back in a cartoon.
01:01:56.58 --> 01:01:57.74 All right, send them through ask you tea.
01:01:57.74 --> 01:01:59.02 So occasionally that happens.
01:01:59.02 --> 01:02:01.06 Sometimes God doesn't even have to get out.
01:02:01.06 --> 01:02:05.86 If a guy's on short duty for three years and he's been in some billet where he's not
01:02:05.86 --> 01:02:10.02 operational for three years, that'll be like, hey, you know, you go back to rescue tea and
01:02:10.02 --> 01:02:12.10 use a guy's a cool, you got it.
01:02:12.10 --> 01:02:18.26 And so you're doing individual skills, but he, in that position, all the other guys, first
01:02:18.26 --> 01:02:21.06 of all the other guys don't even have their tridents yet.
01:02:21.06 --> 01:02:23.90 So he's a actual seal.
01:02:23.90 --> 01:02:28.90 And they're, they're just not even new guys yet because they don't even have their
01:02:28.90 --> 01:02:29.90 tridents.
01:02:29.90 --> 01:02:36.14 So he's in a position of like real mentorship and to help them out and they're looking
01:02:36.14 --> 01:02:37.14 up to him.
01:02:37.14 --> 01:02:39.70 So that's, that's what's happening with him.
01:02:39.70 --> 01:02:40.70 Definitely.
01:02:40.70 --> 01:02:47.86 He, one thing I always loved about Chad is he is very good at teaching you what he
01:02:47.86 --> 01:02:51.62 knows without making you feel dumb.
01:02:51.62 --> 01:02:55.22 I think he gets a lot of that probably from his dad and his, the way his dad is.
01:02:55.22 --> 01:03:02.98 But I think that that's a real skill and try to like foster your own learning while he's
01:03:02.98 --> 01:03:03.98 teaching you something.
01:03:03.98 --> 01:03:09.66 And so I think it was a really natural fit for him while he was in SQT to just be the
01:03:09.66 --> 01:03:14.90 guy that would, you know, lean into guys and say, hey man, this is how I like rig my gear
01:03:14.90 --> 01:03:15.90 up this way.
01:03:15.90 --> 01:03:18.34 And I, you know, do this this way.
01:03:18.34 --> 01:03:23.62 And I think it was a good experience, hopefully, for the guys that were with them, you
01:03:23.62 --> 01:03:28.78 know, to have this more senior person around, but it was also good for Chad.
01:03:28.78 --> 01:03:31.86 And this didn't you start doing CrossFit at this time out here?
01:03:31.86 --> 01:03:32.86 Oh, yeah.
01:03:32.86 --> 01:03:33.86 Yeah.
01:03:33.86 --> 01:03:35.26 And was that Andy's gym?
01:03:35.26 --> 01:03:36.26 Andy stopped.
01:03:36.26 --> 01:03:37.26 Yeah.
01:03:37.26 --> 01:03:42.42 So the reason I'm laughing is because, you know, you're talking about how Chad was the type
01:03:42.42 --> 01:03:47.62 of person that could teach you something without making you feel bad about what you don't
01:03:47.62 --> 01:03:48.62 know.
01:03:48.62 --> 01:03:50.26 I think Andy might be the opposite of that.
01:03:50.26 --> 01:03:53.98 Andy, like, enjoys their feet got to teach somebody something.
01:03:53.98 --> 01:03:56.58 He teaches me stuff that I already know he makes me feel stupid.
01:03:56.58 --> 01:03:57.58 Yeah.
01:03:57.58 --> 01:03:58.58 That's definitely more his personality.
01:03:58.58 --> 01:03:59.58 He likes to have fun with it.
01:03:59.58 --> 01:04:00.58 Yeah.
01:04:00.58 --> 01:04:01.58 Yeah, definitely.
01:04:01.58 --> 01:04:05.02 So you, so this is Andy had like a CrossFit gym in Coronado.
01:04:05.02 --> 01:04:06.02 Yeah.
01:04:06.02 --> 01:04:07.42 And so you just rolled in there and signed up.
01:04:07.42 --> 01:04:09.34 Did you know anything about CrossFit at the time?
01:04:09.34 --> 01:04:12.42 So when we were in Raleigh, Chad started doing CrossFit.
01:04:12.42 --> 01:04:14.78 This was like 2005.
01:04:14.78 --> 01:04:17.14 And he was so into CrossFit.
01:04:17.14 --> 01:04:19.18 I was so not into CrossFit.
01:04:19.18 --> 01:04:20.86 It was kind of how that played out.
01:04:20.86 --> 01:04:23.94 I remember Cook and Dinner one night and he said, you need to come in the garage.
01:04:23.94 --> 01:04:27.42 I got this thing called a muscle up and I was like, oh, and I opened the door and he did
01:04:27.42 --> 01:04:28.42 it and I was like, cool.
01:04:28.42 --> 01:04:29.42 And then slam the door.
01:04:29.42 --> 01:04:31.94 Like a total jerk.
01:04:31.94 --> 01:04:37.10 So he had put me through some workouts and our garage in Raleigh, but I, that minimal exposure,
01:04:37.10 --> 01:04:42.22 you know, and living in Coronado and having two little kids and he's busy with work.
01:04:42.22 --> 01:04:44.06 I feel like, you know, I'm a mom with two kids.
01:04:44.06 --> 01:04:46.22 I probably need to exercise a little bit more.
01:04:46.22 --> 01:04:51.26 Right in my bike one day, I just passed the gym and it was news like literally like just
01:04:51.26 --> 01:04:53.26 opening and I called him.
01:04:53.26 --> 01:04:55.22 Didn't know Andy Stomp at the time.
01:04:55.22 --> 01:04:58.58 Called him up and said, hey, can I come to your gym and that was it?
01:04:58.58 --> 01:04:59.58 That was it.
01:04:59.58 --> 01:05:01.14 Was he teaching?
01:05:01.14 --> 01:05:07.18 Not as much as wife Jamie was teaching a lot.
01:05:07.18 --> 01:05:08.66 Sage Castro.
01:05:08.66 --> 01:05:11.14 Dave Castro's wife was coaching their son.
01:05:11.14 --> 01:05:12.14 Right on.
01:05:12.14 --> 01:05:14.14 It was such, you know, this was the early days.
01:05:14.14 --> 01:05:21.18 We were talking 2007 of, you know, of CrossFit gym kind of expanding.
01:05:21.18 --> 01:05:24.14 And so it was a small gym, not a lot of trainers.
01:05:24.14 --> 01:05:31.90 Yeah, this is so like this is when Dave Castro was teaching SQT.
01:05:31.90 --> 01:05:32.90 Yes.
01:05:32.90 --> 01:05:39.70 And like I think they ran a level one course at SQT.
01:05:39.70 --> 01:05:43.70 And I went and went through it and just like hung out and got whatever some kind of
01:05:43.70 --> 01:05:45.34 certification for that.
01:05:45.34 --> 01:05:50.14 And then that's probably the first time that I met and started hanging out with Dave Castro.
01:05:50.14 --> 01:05:53.38 I think that's it because he was running that and he was like helping me out.
01:05:53.38 --> 01:05:58.02 And then we eventually, well, when we opened this gym that we're sitting in right now, that
01:05:58.02 --> 01:05:59.02 was 2007.
01:05:59.02 --> 01:06:00.26 That was late 2007.
01:06:00.26 --> 01:06:06.14 So we had the, you know, I had to go to the like the shirts and stuff like this that
01:06:06.14 --> 01:06:08.34 you have to get back in the day.
01:06:08.34 --> 01:06:09.34 Yeah.
01:06:09.34 --> 01:06:11.02 He's going to try to keep your gym.
01:06:11.02 --> 01:06:12.46 Yeah, to keep your gym.
01:06:12.46 --> 01:06:14.46 And so you get, you get into it.
01:06:14.46 --> 01:06:15.46 You kind of get into it.
01:06:15.46 --> 01:06:19.58 Yeah, I do, I get really into it.
01:06:19.58 --> 01:06:21.46 I just, you know, I like the challenge.
01:06:21.46 --> 01:06:22.62 I like the physical challenge.
01:06:22.62 --> 01:06:25.14 I like the way my body was changing.
01:06:25.14 --> 01:06:26.54 Remember I'm a mom, a two kids.
01:06:26.54 --> 01:06:30.02 So yeah, I get into it.
01:06:30.02 --> 01:06:32.66 And so I got the opportunity to go to my level one.
01:06:32.66 --> 01:06:36.26 Didn't want to coach people ever, never, never my plan.
01:06:36.26 --> 01:06:37.58 I just wanted to know more about it.
01:06:37.58 --> 01:06:42.14 So I went to my level one in San Diego one weekend.
01:06:42.14 --> 01:06:43.14 Yeah.
01:06:43.14 --> 01:06:46.26 Okay, and then Chad, what's SQT 6, 6 months?
01:06:46.26 --> 01:06:47.26 Something like that.
01:06:47.26 --> 01:06:48.26 Yeah.
01:06:48.26 --> 01:06:52.70 And he's thinking West Coast team, you're living the dream, living in Coronado.
01:06:52.70 --> 01:06:53.70 Yeah.
01:06:53.70 --> 01:06:55.70 And then what happens there?
01:06:55.70 --> 01:06:59.30 Well, Bill King happened.
01:06:59.30 --> 01:07:06.34 The CEO from Damneck came to the West Coast to talk to the SQT guys and to explain
01:07:06.34 --> 01:07:11.82 to them down the pipeline if they want to ever, you know, bridge that gap and head
01:07:11.82 --> 01:07:14.30 over to Seal Team 6.
01:07:14.30 --> 01:07:16.30 Here's kind of what you need to do.
01:07:16.30 --> 01:07:19.70 Most of those guys when they finished SQT as you said they get their trident, they go to
01:07:19.70 --> 01:07:25.82 a regular team, they've got to do two to three deployments, you know, become maybe a little
01:07:25.82 --> 01:07:29.14 less green and then they can screen to go to Damneck.
01:07:29.14 --> 01:07:33.82 And that's when Chad went and took it upon himself to introduce himself to him and say,
01:07:33.82 --> 01:07:35.82 hey, my name is Chad Wilkinson.
01:07:35.82 --> 01:07:37.38 Here's a little bit of my story.
01:07:37.38 --> 01:07:38.38 I'm going to finish this up.
01:07:38.38 --> 01:07:41.78 I'm going to go to West Coast team and then in the future, I plan to go to the West Coast team.
01:07:41.78 --> 01:07:46.82 And I'm coming to screen and he just said, how about you don't and just come screen right
01:07:46.82 --> 01:07:47.82 now?
01:07:47.82 --> 01:07:49.82 That was that.
01:07:49.82 --> 01:07:52.54 Yeah, and he didn't consult me at all.
01:07:52.54 --> 01:07:55.86 So what did you get six months in the nodo?
01:07:55.86 --> 01:07:57.50 Yeah, that's just about it.
01:07:57.50 --> 01:07:58.70 I was pretty upset.
01:07:58.70 --> 01:08:01.14 I mean, but not, right?
01:08:01.14 --> 01:08:05.50 I mean, this is our life and this is our path, but I did not want to leave.
01:08:05.50 --> 01:08:09.30 Yeah, he came home and he said, hey, I'm going to fly to Virginia Beach next weekend and
01:08:09.30 --> 01:08:13.42 do this thing to screen and if that's the case, we're moving.
01:08:13.42 --> 01:08:18.26 And yeah, fast forward, we moved back to Virginia Beach April of 2008.
01:08:18.26 --> 01:08:22.74 Did you move back there even before like while he's starting to go through green team and
01:08:22.74 --> 01:08:23.74 everything?
01:08:23.74 --> 01:08:25.62 Oh, yeah, yeah, we moved like with him.
01:08:25.62 --> 01:08:30.26 Like he left to go to green team, we moved back.
01:08:30.26 --> 01:08:36.22 So then he makes it through green team and starts the cycle over there, which is deployment,
01:08:36.22 --> 01:08:39.18 deployment, deployment, work deployment, work deployment, work deployment, work deployment, work
01:08:39.18 --> 01:08:40.18 deployment, work deployment, work deployment.
01:08:40.18 --> 01:08:45.66 At that time, yeah, 2008 it was fast and furious.
01:08:45.66 --> 01:08:47.06 It was busy.
01:08:47.06 --> 01:08:51.98 And when you get to Virginia Beach, are you, what'd you do with your CrossFit deal?
01:08:51.98 --> 01:08:54.22 So I moved back to Virginia Beach.
01:08:54.22 --> 01:08:59.98 I check out, at the time, there were only two other gyms in the area and I couldn't
01:08:59.98 --> 01:09:05.22 really take my kids because this was before there were a lot of kids spaces in CrossFit
01:09:05.22 --> 01:09:08.10 gyms and there was really no where safer them to be.
01:09:08.10 --> 01:09:13.38 We rented an apartment when we came back to Virginia Beach not knowing where we wanted to live.
01:09:13.38 --> 01:09:16.02 And also not knowing if the whole green team thing was going to pan out.
01:09:16.02 --> 01:09:20.34 I think for Chad, he just was like, I don't really know.
01:09:20.34 --> 01:09:26.50 And he rented a garage in this apartment complex and we bought enough equipment so that
01:09:26.50 --> 01:09:30.90 we could put two people he and I essentially threw a workout.
01:09:30.90 --> 01:09:34.10 And then my girlfriend said, well, can I come work out with you?
01:09:34.10 --> 01:09:36.42 I was like, sure.
01:09:36.42 --> 01:09:41.62 And then that just kind of grew and grew and then we had a whole bunch of people outside
01:09:41.62 --> 01:09:44.98 of the garage one day and fast forward October 2008.
01:09:44.98 --> 01:09:46.42 I opened my gym.
01:09:46.42 --> 01:09:55.22 So he's in green team and anybody who's listening and has lived that is very stressful.
01:09:55.22 --> 01:09:59.70 Especially when you're doing all these things and you come home and you got your wife
01:09:59.70 --> 01:10:02.14 and your kids and you got to do the family man thing too.
01:10:02.14 --> 01:10:06.06 And then I go ahead to take it upon myself to start this whole business venture.
01:10:07.18 --> 01:10:07.34 Yeah.
01:10:08.38 --> 01:10:11.74 You rented, how many of you was the space that you rented for that CrossFit gym?
01:10:12.30 --> 01:10:13.02 Oh, the first one?
01:10:13.02 --> 01:10:13.34 Yeah.
01:10:13.34 --> 01:10:14.06 Who?
01:10:14.06 --> 01:10:17.10 It was like 12 to 1300 square feet.
01:10:17.90 --> 01:10:24.46 And I just remember saying in the car, I was like, I need to do this because this is,
01:10:24.46 --> 01:10:28.14 this is about to take off and this is what all I want to do.
01:10:28.14 --> 01:10:33.34 I think he was a little worried because, you know, in our,
01:10:33.34 --> 01:10:41.42 in our, in our, in our, in our world, you live a really quiet life and he didn't want anything that I was doing
01:10:41.42 --> 01:10:48.38 to not overshadow but have any sort of imprint on what he was doing.
01:10:48.38 --> 01:10:48.54 Yeah.
01:10:48.54 --> 01:10:55.34 You know, and of course in a military town, the, the interesting part about Oating the gym is
01:10:55.34 --> 01:11:01.82 what you're doing is you're providing a service to people and it's a very personal service.
01:11:01.82 --> 01:11:07.66 So people think they know you and what happens is your friends come and join the gym and I had kind of
01:11:07.66 --> 01:11:13.02 established at the very beginning like we're friends, but at the same time this is, this is a, you know,
01:11:13.02 --> 01:11:18.06 a business and you do, if, if you're a team life, you don't talk about it in this gym.
01:11:18.94 --> 01:11:21.58 You don't, I don't want to hear when your husband's coming home.
01:11:21.58 --> 01:11:23.26 I don't want to hear when your husband's leaving.
01:11:23.26 --> 01:11:24.78 I don't want to hear about another spouse.
01:11:25.66 --> 01:11:26.78 That just wasn't going to fly.
01:11:27.74 --> 01:11:29.50 So, so we were busy.
01:11:30.22 --> 01:11:31.18 I would too little kids.
01:11:31.18 --> 01:11:33.18 And how did the gym take off? How did it do?
01:11:33.18 --> 01:11:34.54 It went, it was awesome.
01:11:35.18 --> 01:11:41.90 My whole hope was just to be able to cover the rent and my expenses and we exceeded that the first month.
01:11:42.30 --> 01:11:43.10 The first month.
01:11:44.06 --> 01:11:48.70 And we were still working on a lot of things though, you know, the first person that came
01:11:48.70 --> 01:11:53.18 beyond my kids and they had a little kid, I didn't know what to do with them. So I stacked up some
01:11:53.18 --> 01:11:58.14 tires and I just stuck the kid in the center of the tires. I like to just stay there,
01:11:58.14 --> 01:12:02.38 to where done. Because it was such a small space. I look back at those pictures now.
01:12:02.38 --> 01:12:07.18 I'll land anybody from CrossFit listening. And I do not know how someone didn't get clubbed
01:12:07.18 --> 01:12:11.26 in the head of the barbell. How close we were, but it all worked out.
01:12:12.70 --> 01:12:18.14 In meanwhile, Chad's, like you said, this is now 2008. So it's just, um, it's on.
01:12:18.14 --> 01:12:24.30 Yeah. And he's going on deployments. And now we kind of already talked about this. And I mentioned
01:12:24.30 --> 01:12:29.10 that my wife would be like, I don't even know where my husband's at. He's gone. And he'll be back later.
01:12:29.10 --> 01:12:35.58 And that was kind of her attitude. And it's, I think quite frankly, well, I can't speak for
01:12:35.58 --> 01:12:40.70 everybody, but it definitely worked for my wife. You know, she just, hey, you go do what you
01:12:40.70 --> 01:12:45.42 got to do. I'll be here. I'll be here, man in the fort, back home. And that was good.
01:12:45.42 --> 01:12:49.42 Maybe it would have been more stressful if she knew where I was or what I was doing or anything
01:12:49.42 --> 01:12:54.62 like that. She just was like, you go do what you got to do. Did you guys have that? Was that sort
01:12:54.62 --> 01:13:01.18 of the way you guys operated? Yeah. I mean, when he, when he was deploying, it was Iraq, Afghanistan,
01:13:01.82 --> 01:13:09.02 then it became Africa. And I knew, generally, you know, what country he was in. But beyond that,
01:13:09.02 --> 01:13:16.78 that's how we always operated was you do your job. And I'll do my job, meaning take care of our
01:13:16.78 --> 01:13:20.54 kids when you're gone. And when you're gone, you're gone and when you're home, your home.
01:13:21.58 --> 01:13:26.22 I know some other spouses, they share a whole lot. And they, they know probably way more stories
01:13:26.22 --> 01:13:34.38 about their husband than I know. And maybe almost too much, but Chad really, really lived by the fact
01:13:34.38 --> 01:13:39.26 that you don't talk about it. And it could have much to what you said, maybe he just didn't want
01:13:39.26 --> 01:13:45.90 me to worry either. That's what I'd like to think. And vice versa, I didn't call him and say,
01:13:46.70 --> 01:13:51.66 I mean, my hot water heater busted one time in the attic and flooding everywhere. What's it
01:13:51.66 --> 01:14:00.38 going to do if I call him? And now, so you know, seal why it's a tough to. Yeah, definitely. And I think,
01:14:00.38 --> 01:14:05.18 you know, you said, you said you weren't sure if Chad didn't want you to worry. I can almost
01:14:05.18 --> 01:14:11.18 guarantee you that the attitude was like the last thing he wants you to do is worry. And I remember
01:14:11.90 --> 01:14:17.74 one of my guys, Mikey Montsour, who, you know, he died at the end of our deployment. But when
01:14:17.74 --> 01:14:25.42 when I got home and talking to his family and his sister Sarah was, you know, just telling me,
01:14:25.42 --> 01:14:31.42 this was, we were in this place called Ramani. It was a really kinetic deployment with a lot of
01:14:31.42 --> 01:14:38.46 casualties. And he had told his family, you know, when he would call them, oh yeah, we're just,
01:14:38.46 --> 01:14:42.22 you know, we're just training some Iraqis. We're, yeah, if we're not doing anything, it's boring,
01:14:42.22 --> 01:14:46.86 like all these kind of things. I mean, these are just outright not true at all. But he just didn't
01:14:46.86 --> 01:14:51.90 want his family to worry about what he was doing. Yeah, and we had certain like code things. I knew
01:14:51.90 --> 01:14:57.42 when he would call me and he would say, okay, I'll call you when I can and I love you,
01:14:57.42 --> 01:15:02.94 he was going out. He was going out to do stuff. And I, you know, what he called me in a day,
01:15:02.94 --> 01:15:07.18 would it be three or four days? I don't know, but I knew that meant he was going to be busy.
01:15:08.22 --> 01:15:14.54 And I'll also say, like, from my perspective again, this is just me. But I don't want to talk to my
01:15:14.54 --> 01:15:19.18 wife about that stuff. You know, I don't want to talk to my wife. I don't want to explain to her what's
01:15:19.18 --> 01:15:24.06 going on with this. And what I don't want, I don't want to talk to her about like what are kids are doing
01:15:24.06 --> 01:15:28.30 or what we're having for dinner or whatever. I want to talk about other stuff. That's what I want to
01:15:28.30 --> 01:15:34.22 talk about. I don't want to talk about team guy stuff with my wife. That's not, so maybe that,
01:15:34.22 --> 01:15:41.02 you know, plays into it too. And yeah, I mean, like I said, my wife would shoot barely know
01:15:41.02 --> 01:15:45.26 what I was going or whatever. And it's partly because I didn't want to worry about, but also,
01:15:45.26 --> 01:15:51.50 I just don't want to talk about other stuff. Yeah. Talk about work. You know,
01:15:51.50 --> 01:15:56.86 19 hours with these dudes. I want to talk about it with you, darling. I don't want to talk about
01:15:56.86 --> 01:16:03.10 something else. But at some point, you must have realized, or did you start to see like,
01:16:03.10 --> 01:16:09.74 hey, these things are wearing on Chad? These deployments are like, was there a change in his
01:16:09.74 --> 01:16:22.38 attitude and his personality in the way he carried himself? Yes, and no, I think it's hard to
01:16:22.38 --> 01:16:29.18 distinguish when exactly that was. And I'm going to bounce around a minute. I just had to scroll
01:16:29.18 --> 01:16:33.26 through a bunch of photos, Jason and I were working on something. And they're scrolling through
01:16:33.26 --> 01:16:40.70 those photos the other day. What I realized is when he really got bad, it was two years before he
01:16:40.70 --> 01:16:51.50 died. So 2016, I can almost see it through photos. But even before that, I do know, I know some
01:16:51.50 --> 01:16:57.66 stories now since he's died that he never shared with me in 2012 was a pretty big deployment,
01:16:57.66 --> 01:17:02.86 I guess, or crazy deployment. I don't know the best way to say that. And I think some stuff
01:17:02.86 --> 01:17:13.02 happened there. And 2014, he was starting to change a little bit more. But what a spouse says is,
01:17:13.90 --> 01:17:21.90 well, that's just how they are. And the world, the media talks, you know, maybe seals are big
01:17:21.90 --> 01:17:30.70 in the news now, right? Since 9-11, since May of 2011, they're all over and they're made to be
01:17:30.70 --> 01:17:37.58 larger than life. And they use these words. And so if a guy has always told how brave and fearless
01:17:37.58 --> 01:17:44.06 and heroic and strong they are, then he's got to believe that. He's got to live that. And then on
01:17:44.06 --> 01:17:51.02 the same token, you see with our special operators how they are, you know, quiet and how they do
01:17:51.02 --> 01:17:55.58 sit in the corner of the room. And their back is always, you know, to the wall. And they're always
01:17:55.58 --> 01:18:00.54 facing the door. And they don't want to engage in conversational all the time. And just
01:18:00.54 --> 01:18:07.50 chalk up all those PTSD symptoms that people like to throw out. But it's, I think it's very easy
01:18:07.50 --> 01:18:12.38 for someone like a spouse to say, well, that's just kind of how the guys are. Because they have a
01:18:12.38 --> 01:18:19.10 stressful job. And they're beat down. Their bodies broken. So, so you said when you're looking at
01:18:19.10 --> 01:18:25.42 pictures now and you're going through the years, you can kind of start to identify things that you
01:18:25.42 --> 01:18:30.46 saw that you, when you look back, it becomes a little bit, this has become more obvious as you look back.
01:18:30.86 --> 01:18:36.70 Yeah, yeah. I mean, I, I couldn't tell you then. But it's, it's more obvious to me now.
01:18:37.74 --> 01:18:43.82 This might be a dumb question. But do you think that that has to do with the fact that we don't
01:18:43.82 --> 01:18:50.46 get taught anything about this kind of stuff? We mean, and maybe it's more prevalent now. But
01:18:50.46 --> 01:19:02.86 you know, I did a couple podcasts on here about Louis Poler, Louis Poler Jr. He was the son of a
01:19:02.86 --> 01:19:11.58 famous Marine, the most famous Marine named Chester Poler. And Louis Poler was, he, his dad,
01:19:11.58 --> 01:19:21.50 Chester Poler was like the, the most iconic Marine ever. And he received five Navy crosses. And he,
01:19:22.30 --> 01:19:29.18 the, here's a good way to describe how iconic he is. He, the Marine Corps has a, has a,
01:19:30.38 --> 01:19:36.62 what is it a mascot? And they've had one. It's a bulldog. And yeah, the mascot, I think they're on number
01:19:36.62 --> 01:19:42.86 17, but the mascot is named Chester. And at boot camp, they sing a good night Chester,
01:19:42.86 --> 01:19:46.46 whatever, you may be. That's what they do in Marine Corps, Lucas. So this guy, Chester Poler,
01:19:46.46 --> 01:19:55.74 the most iconic Marine of all time. And he had a son. And his son was, uh, not quite cut from the
01:19:55.74 --> 01:20:01.02 same cloth as his dad. You know, his dad was this kind of gruff guy. And this son was sort of
01:20:01.02 --> 01:20:10.22 a more mild guy. He wore glasses. He went to college. He, uh, was just more of a cerebral type guy.
01:20:10.22 --> 01:20:13.58 And he gets done with college. And he's not really sure what he's going to do with his life.
01:20:14.22 --> 01:20:20.06 So he decides to, well, you know, my dad was in the Marine Corps. So he goes to join the Marine
01:20:20.06 --> 01:20:26.62 Corps. He can barely get in because his, his eyesight's bad. The people that are looking at his
01:20:26.62 --> 01:20:31.82 application are like, wait a second, this is Lewis Poler Jr. Are you Chester Poler son? Is that,
01:20:31.82 --> 01:20:37.02 yeah, but we can get you in. So he gets in the Marine Corps. Goes through Hofstra County School,
01:20:37.02 --> 01:20:47.10 goes to the basics school. And then it's 1968. So he goes to Vietnam. And when he gets to Vietnam,
01:20:49.50 --> 01:20:55.74 going on rotations in these three different spots. And eventually, uh, goes on an operation.
01:20:55.74 --> 01:21:03.10 And he steps on a landmine. Get severely wounded. He loses both of his legs. He loses a bunch of his
01:21:03.10 --> 01:21:09.18 fingers and dexterity in his hands. Almost dies. I mean, it's just a miracle that they were able
01:21:09.18 --> 01:21:17.66 to keep my life. And he, he does stay alive. Um, it comes back to America. You know, devastating
01:21:17.66 --> 01:21:29.02 for his dad, the great iconic Marine hero is breaking down when he sees his son. Chester Poler,
01:21:29.98 --> 01:21:36.38 Lewis Poler, you know, eventually recovered from his wounds. And uh, wrote a book called
01:21:36.38 --> 01:21:42.14 Fortune at Son, which is an incredible book. And sort of, you know, he was, he'd gone down the path of
01:21:42.14 --> 01:21:50.86 alcohol and being an alcoholic and all this. And, um, eventually comes out of that writes this book,
01:21:50.86 --> 01:22:00.62 the book, it's published. And in 1994, he fell out of his wheelchair injured himself, went back
01:22:00.62 --> 01:22:08.06 in the hospital. Um, they put him on painkillers. He got addicted to painkillers again. And, and he killed himself.
01:22:08.06 --> 01:22:17.18 Um, and what was, when I, when I did this series of podcasts about this, what was crazy was
01:22:17.98 --> 01:22:24.94 every single Marine, every single Marine, 100% knows who Chester Poler is. But,
01:22:26.86 --> 01:22:32.46 a vast majority of Marines that I talked to as that podcast was coming out, did not know
01:22:32.46 --> 01:22:42.86 the story of his son. And it seems like the perfect way to educate people about the
01:22:44.14 --> 01:22:47.82 hardships that people face when they come home for more and they, you know, obviously,
01:22:47.82 --> 01:22:54.46 Lewis Poler had a multitude of hardships as well. But it seems like the education that we receive
01:22:55.66 --> 01:23:00.46 and not just us in the military, but then the families just that there's things, hey,
01:23:00.46 --> 01:23:09.18 this is what we need to be looking out for. And it, it seems like if you're, if you now are looking
01:23:09.18 --> 01:23:16.38 back at pictures to be able to say, man, I see this. I remember this. These are the kind of things.
01:23:16.38 --> 01:23:21.18 Is this like, like part of the things that you're trying to share now so that people have
01:23:21.18 --> 01:23:28.62 better education about this kind of stuff? Oh my gosh. Yes. Yes. And again, I'm no scientist. I'm
01:23:28.62 --> 01:23:35.42 no doctor. I don't have a research under my belt, but I have what I've lived. And sitting in my chair,
01:23:36.62 --> 01:23:42.54 having been with this person for so long. You know, we, we, I didn't just like meet a team guy,
01:23:42.54 --> 01:23:47.18 and then we got married, and that's not to bust on anybody that did. But, you know, I've known
01:23:47.18 --> 01:23:55.02 him almost his entire life. And then to watch him through his career and then to lose him in this way,
01:23:55.02 --> 01:24:05.98 I didn't see all these signs and symptoms prior. I think if Chad, I want to believe that if Chad
01:24:05.98 --> 01:24:12.30 thought something was wrong with him that he was probably trying to hide it from me. I have
01:24:12.30 --> 01:24:18.54 other girlfriends, widows, whose husbands took their life. And they have said that their husbands
01:24:18.54 --> 01:24:23.58 expressed to them the struggle they were having and what they were thinking about. And you know,
01:24:24.94 --> 01:24:29.82 their signs and symptoms, and I didn't have that. And it's not going to be the same for everybody
01:24:29.82 --> 01:24:35.82 or humans or all different. Biological DNA, I'd express itself differently. But if we could maybe
01:24:36.62 --> 01:24:47.50 educate people a little bit more about the toll your service takes. And, and to know that even if you're
01:24:47.50 --> 01:24:53.98 not killed in action or killed in training or you don't die by suicide, but you've led a very
01:24:54.54 --> 01:25:02.22 active career. You are going to be impacted some more than others. And let's really have a conversation
01:25:02.22 --> 01:25:06.78 about what you might see and when is it going to be really problem?
01:25:06.78 --> 01:25:17.26 So as these deployments are adding up for Chad, I mean, is when he's coming home, is it
01:25:17.82 --> 01:25:27.50 what is the kind of things you're noticing? Well, he's always super quiet guy, never the loudest guy in
01:25:27.50 --> 01:25:38.38 the room reserved. But as time goes on, he's even less. And when we first, you know, a teammate
01:25:38.38 --> 01:25:42.70 we hung out with people and had friends and when we first got to the command, we did that too.
01:25:42.70 --> 01:25:47.82 And then over time, we just didn't. We didn't do social things. I mean, we almost never
01:25:47.82 --> 01:25:55.34 ever had anyone over to our house, ever. He never wanted anybody in our house. He, he any
01:25:55.34 --> 01:25:59.42 says he likes to be home. He like to be home with the kids and I kind of what you mentioned. He's like,
01:25:59.42 --> 01:26:04.38 I'm with those dudes all the time. Like, I don't need to go hang out with them because I've just spent,
01:26:04.38 --> 01:26:11.58 you know, a rut trip in Chicago with them and I'm home now. But it, it, it, what got really bad right
01:26:11.58 --> 01:26:19.26 away was a sleep. And I think that that's true for a lot of the guys is that, you know, sleep is so
01:26:19.26 --> 01:26:23.82 valued. And it's, if you think of your body, I like to think of it as a computer. And if you don't
01:26:23.82 --> 01:26:27.82 turn the computer down every once in a while and reboot boot it and it gets jacked up, right?
01:26:27.82 --> 01:26:34.62 Doesn't run well. And that's what sleep provides all of us every single night. And if you've got a guy
01:26:35.02 --> 01:26:42.94 who has his body hurts, I mean, Chad fell off of a ladder, pretty high up and Jack does back up.
01:26:42.94 --> 01:26:48.62 He messed his neck up off of a couple of blending. He did. He was in the helicopter crash in 98.
01:26:48.62 --> 01:26:56.86 So, you know, I mean, his body, and I say this because I know so many of the guys are like really
01:26:56.86 --> 01:27:02.06 broken and he's probably the least of it in terms of broken bones and this and that, but his body
01:27:02.06 --> 01:27:08.94 is beat up as most of them are. And then you add on top of that just the mental strain of war.
01:27:08.94 --> 01:27:19.10 Just deployments, you know, sleep and over and some shitty ass village compound, you know,
01:27:19.10 --> 01:27:25.66 you're listening to blast coming in. The high cycle of just like missions going out, going out,
01:27:25.66 --> 01:27:30.86 going out, okay? Being away from your family and even though I didn't call my husband and say,
01:27:30.86 --> 01:27:36.14 hey, this is broken or I need this. Maybe that's all other spouses communicates. And now there
01:27:36.14 --> 01:27:41.90 might be stress because they got shit going on back home with their family and so let's all
01:27:41.90 --> 01:27:47.50 add all that on to it. And now let's add at least for our special operators, the whole blast injury
01:27:47.50 --> 01:27:55.58 concept. And the guys that have spent time and I'm going to talk teams because that's what I know,
01:27:55.58 --> 01:28:04.70 but time and the teams, the last 10 to 20 years, they 100% in my opinion are affected by blast injury
01:28:04.70 --> 01:28:09.34 because it comes from them breaching doors, which they do not just overseas, but in training,
01:28:09.34 --> 01:28:15.42 you know, he lows RPGs all that and that constant impact to the brain is
01:28:17.82 --> 01:28:25.18 terrible. It's terrible. And so you add all this stuff this guy's a con through and he can't sleep.
01:28:26.14 --> 01:28:32.14 He can't get a good night's sleep. So there's nothing helping him for his body to at least try to
01:28:32.14 --> 01:28:39.02 recover something. So his sleep went down bad. See, as he seen doctors or anything, as he
01:28:39.02 --> 01:28:42.78 talking to anybody about trying to get sleep. I mean, sometimes, you know, at some points, they were
01:28:42.78 --> 01:28:49.90 given away like the sleep potions like it was nothing. Oh, yeah. I mean, he did, he tried to do a lot of
01:28:49.90 --> 01:28:55.82 his own stuff, just like normal regular remedy stuff and better sleep hygiene. And then he was
01:28:55.82 --> 01:29:01.18 diagnosed with sleep apnea, which a lot of them have. So they have a CPAP machine. I mean, why are
01:29:01.18 --> 01:29:08.94 their dudes in their 30s and 40s with sleep apnea? Doesn't, and not weird. And then, you know,
01:29:08.94 --> 01:29:14.94 and then what you also see in these guys is they get low testosterone and because of, you know,
01:29:14.94 --> 01:29:19.82 there are adrenal glands or jacked out. Their cortisol levels are jacked up. And so their testosterone
01:29:19.82 --> 01:29:24.62 is jacked up. And I don't know how many of them are really willing to talk about it, but I think
01:29:24.62 --> 01:29:29.98 there's a really large number of dudes in special operations that are in their 30s
01:29:29.98 --> 01:29:35.50 that are on testosterone. And they're not, I can't speak for everyone. I mean, I think they're
01:29:35.50 --> 01:29:39.66 on it for like the next time they want to be jacked. They're on it because their teeth really low.
01:29:39.66 --> 01:29:48.70 And that's needed, you know? Oh, yeah, that's not getting fired up. Yeah. So, you're seeing all this
01:29:48.70 --> 01:29:55.98 stuff. Is there a point where you start like trying to intervene yourself or is Chad just like,
01:29:55.98 --> 01:30:02.94 you know, again, I'm comparing this to my experience. Like, I would never, my wife didn't know
01:30:02.94 --> 01:30:07.50 if there was anything going on. Like, with bad things, we're happening at work. My wife would not know.
01:30:07.50 --> 01:30:14.78 Well, and this is where like regret comes in and just kind of guilt. A lot of guilt.
01:30:17.42 --> 01:30:22.46 Because it's really easy to sit here now and list all the things I could have done to be a
01:30:22.46 --> 01:30:37.82 better wife. But at the time, I... Chad and I, Chad and I are both the type of people that
01:30:38.62 --> 01:30:45.26 we want to work really hard at what we do and we want to be really, really freaking good at it.
01:30:47.26 --> 01:30:51.66 Being married to him while there are spouses and they choose to, to, whatever they're out,
01:30:51.66 --> 01:30:55.34 maybe they work, maybe they stay out with their kids, everybody gets a choice, right?
01:30:55.34 --> 01:31:01.90 And my choice was to work and go this whole fitness CrossFit path. So, when you're married to someone
01:31:01.90 --> 01:31:05.50 who's its neighbor, you see, and does all these awesome things and gets these awards,
01:31:05.50 --> 01:31:10.62 I was super proud of them, but I also wanted my own identity and I wanted my own success.
01:31:11.34 --> 01:31:17.34 And in a lot of that driving force, truthfully, was always because I wanted him to be proud of me.
01:31:17.34 --> 01:31:24.14 And so he's working hard in the teams and I'm working really hard on this whole CrossFit side.
01:31:24.94 --> 01:31:32.30 And I don't think it's that I didn't want to intervene. I just kind of thought we both were
01:31:33.50 --> 01:31:38.94 almost like handling our shit. If that's fair to say. Like, okay, you're working, you're busy,
01:31:39.66 --> 01:31:46.06 you know, you're moving up, you know, within your troop and squadron and the whole thing. And
01:31:46.06 --> 01:31:49.98 I'm doing it over here and then we come home and we take our kids and
01:31:52.46 --> 01:31:55.42 I guess I just didn't take enough of responsibility for that.
01:32:03.58 --> 01:32:07.10 Is there, is there some point where you say, okay, this was sort of
01:32:09.66 --> 01:32:14.30 where you said, you said when you were looking through pictures, you said two years before you died,
01:32:14.30 --> 01:32:19.74 you were like, yeah, I look back now and that this is a time period where there was definitely
01:32:20.30 --> 01:32:26.78 he was, you know, over the edge. Yeah, I mean, he really got a shorter fuse for sure.
01:32:28.38 --> 01:32:34.06 And it generally wasn't with me. It tended to be more with our kids. He would just snap,
01:32:34.06 --> 01:32:43.42 which was really out of character for him. And he would not listen. And I think a lot of
01:32:43.42 --> 01:32:47.66 spouses say, you know, my husband doesn't listen to me. I've doesn't listen to me when I'm talking,
01:32:47.66 --> 01:32:53.34 but it's like he had no idea I was talking to. And I'd be sitting right next to him. And
01:32:56.46 --> 01:33:01.02 I've shared this story before, but I think it really says something that he,
01:33:01.74 --> 01:33:06.46 I said, Chad, you never listened to me. Like, just look at me. I need you to look at me and I need
01:33:06.46 --> 01:33:12.78 you to focus. And he said, you know what, when you talk to me, I have to look around and think,
01:33:12.78 --> 01:33:17.66 well, that's not going to kill me. And that's not going to kill me. And I remember thinking,
01:33:17.66 --> 01:33:26.22 that's so weird. But now I realize if you're kind of in this hyper state and you don't have a way to
01:33:26.22 --> 01:33:30.06 get out of it, you go into a poignant and you kind of have to stay on point, right? Heads always
01:33:30.06 --> 01:33:35.02 on a swivel, you may win your in bed, you got to be ready for the next thing. How do you turn that off
01:33:35.02 --> 01:33:42.30 when you come home? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. They've really figured that out. So they come home
01:33:42.30 --> 01:33:47.42 and they're still kind of like overloaded. And that's something that you notice because you're talking
01:33:47.42 --> 01:33:53.98 to them and he's like not responding. And yeah, and in the pictures two years prior and the pictures
01:33:53.98 --> 01:33:58.30 when I look at it, he just had a completely different look on his face. It was almost like,
01:33:59.82 --> 01:34:04.22 like in pictures, it was almost like I'm going to kill you, you know, like that whole like,
01:34:04.22 --> 01:34:12.70 it just, it's just not like him. Yeah, that's the interesting thing that you pointed out is like
01:34:12.70 --> 01:34:19.10 you've known him since he was whatever 15. Yeah. And so you see this entire arc of a human
01:34:19.66 --> 01:34:28.54 whereas, you know, if you cut out, if you met him in 2010, you would see this much smaller picture
01:34:28.54 --> 01:34:35.58 that maybe wouldn't paint such a dramatic change in his character and the way he acted. Right?
01:34:35.58 --> 01:34:43.58 But you saw him since he was 15 years old and, you know, and then you see this whole story play out.
01:34:43.58 --> 01:34:50.86 And so it becomes real clear. There also being said, since you're with him every day,
01:34:50.86 --> 01:34:55.42 you know, you're around him all the time. So there's also that that thing where,
01:34:55.42 --> 01:34:59.98 you know, you don't notice that someone, you know, like, you don't notice that my hair's going
01:34:59.98 --> 01:35:05.34 right, right? Because like my wife doesn't, she might notice it now. But, you know, over time.
01:35:05.34 --> 01:35:09.74 So like, oh, your hair went great today, right? It's like happens gradually over time. And so
01:35:09.74 --> 01:35:14.54 there's some of that. I'm sure it play too where, you know, one deployment, there's three degrees
01:35:14.54 --> 01:35:19.10 of change, right? The next deployment, there's four degrees of change. The next deployment,
01:35:19.10 --> 01:35:25.26 there's five degrees of change. Okay. So you look up in six deployments and that little bit each time
01:35:25.26 --> 01:35:31.82 you may not notice it so dramatically. But from the, the, the amount that he's on a different course,
01:35:31.82 --> 01:35:38.78 mentally is dramatic. Yeah. And I, and I, I tried to take it back through chunks of our life.
01:35:38.78 --> 01:35:45.18 And go back as far as our childhood. But more like when we were at teammate, how he was with his
01:35:45.18 --> 01:35:49.82 fellow team guys and peers in the way that we interacted with them. And then when we got out of
01:35:49.82 --> 01:35:54.54 the military, the way that he was. And, you know, we had friends and did all the things normal
01:35:54.54 --> 01:36:00.38 couples and families do. And then coming back and then being at the command for the first couple
01:36:00.38 --> 01:36:08.30 years, it was that way. And then slowly he just did less and less socially. He was a little more
01:36:08.30 --> 01:36:16.06 cut off. And then as it got farther along, he just was a little quieter. And, you know, the last
01:36:16.06 --> 01:36:26.54 year or two of his life, I'm, I'd sad. I'm like, gosh, I don't even know how much he smiled.
01:36:27.26 --> 01:36:34.86 Yeah. And no, um, no, no, him saying like, hey, I got to talk to somebody.
01:36:34.86 --> 01:36:46.38 No, no.
01:36:46.38 --> 01:36:53.66 Which, um, I mean, I, I'm guessing it's changing now. But I mean, that's the culture from
01:36:53.66 --> 01:37:01.50 buds, from basic seal training. Don't go to medical. Right? Don't go to medical. Don't talk
01:37:01.50 --> 01:37:06.70 to anybody. If you've got a stress for action, your leg, let it break. Don't go to medical.
01:37:06.70 --> 01:37:11.10 Hobble around as long as you can. Don't like that's, and again, it's not like anybody.
01:37:11.10 --> 01:37:14.06 Of course, what do the instructors say? Yep, go to medical. Check in if you've got it. If you're feeling
01:37:14.06 --> 01:37:21.10 but the, the culture is, and it's the same in every unit. It's, it's every unit. It's like this.
01:37:21.10 --> 01:37:23.90 I mean, and it's special operates every unit. It's every unit in the military.
01:37:23.90 --> 01:37:31.10 Lock it up. Don't say anything. Don't go to medical. Hand like you said, handle your shit.
01:37:43.10 --> 01:37:49.50 Yeah, I think the guys are just to, I, I, I don't know what they think. I don't know if they think
01:37:49.50 --> 01:37:54.30 maybe this is just me. Like, what's up with me? Am I fucked up? I don't want to tell my buddies. I'm
01:37:54.30 --> 01:38:00.30 might be a little fucked up. Or they don't want to hurt their service. Or they just want to
01:38:00.30 --> 01:38:07.50 ignore it and hope it'll go away. They think they'll just like muscle through it. I don't know what
01:38:07.50 --> 01:38:14.30 they think. But somehow we need to shift the little needle a little bit to recognize
01:38:14.30 --> 01:38:22.06 is you do all this training. I mean, millions of dollars are spent on these guys. You guys to
01:38:22.06 --> 01:38:28.46 train millions of dollars. And, you know, I mean, Chad was a sniper and free-falled jumpmaster and,
01:38:28.46 --> 01:38:32.70 you know, name all the things. And you took the time to teach him that.
01:38:35.34 --> 01:38:42.70 So why wouldn't you take the time to also teach them about maybe some ways that they're going to be
01:38:42.70 --> 01:38:50.06 potentially impacted after multiple years of service? It's 2021 and right now what we're about to
01:38:50.06 --> 01:38:58.62 see are people that have served their entire career post 911. So this suicide epidemic,
01:38:59.34 --> 01:39:01.66 it is not going away. It's only ramping up.
01:39:04.14 --> 01:39:09.74 Yeah, you know, when I, when I kind of started off talking about this, that's the connection that I
01:39:09.74 --> 01:39:15.18 made as I was like listening to your story hearing it is, you know, we've made all these developments
01:39:15.18 --> 01:39:21.34 and all these different wars from the problems that the wars cause, right? And yet, and I'd even
01:39:21.34 --> 01:39:26.38 talk about like, like, these current wars, the prosthetics, you see the prosthetics that people have
01:39:26.38 --> 01:39:31.82 now, they're amazing. You know, they can do all these incredible things. And we make these massive
01:39:31.82 --> 01:39:38.54 advancements. And yet, this is just like over here in this dark corner, not really being addressed.
01:39:38.54 --> 01:39:43.98 Now, I take that back. There is, there are things that are happening now that they are starting
01:39:43.98 --> 01:39:47.50 to address. I know that they're doing like baseline studies of guys. I don't know what you know about
01:39:47.50 --> 01:39:53.02 the stuff Jason, but they're doing like baseline studies, brain studies on guys, so they can kind of
01:39:53.02 --> 01:39:58.78 tell where they're at, so they can see what kind of impact they've had over over time. So I think
01:39:58.78 --> 01:40:05.34 maybe it is starting to come to light a little bit now. But certainly, I don't think the culture
01:40:05.34 --> 01:40:12.86 has a big change to it yet because, I mean, it takes time to offer to change culture.
01:40:12.86 --> 01:40:18.38 It would crush the recruitment process, wouldn't it? We've known for years because of history
01:40:18.38 --> 01:40:23.66 and wars that when you go serve your country, there's likely how do you could die? You're choosing
01:40:23.66 --> 01:40:33.82 to serve and die potentially by your flag, but it would really crush recruitment if insert army,
01:40:33.82 --> 01:40:40.70 navy, whoever. And you say, hey, you want to be a seal? You want to be a green beret? You want to be a
01:40:40.70 --> 01:40:43.74 and you say, you're going to come, you're going to do your service, you're going to do cool
01:40:43.74 --> 01:40:47.18 shit, you're going to jump out of airplanes, you're going to shoot guns and you're going to kill bad
01:40:47.18 --> 01:40:53.58 guys. And if you make it by the end of it, you might also have some pretty severe mental health issues
01:40:53.58 --> 01:41:01.58 and some brain injury. Are you going to go with that? It's hard for them to pony up and say that
01:41:01.58 --> 01:41:07.42 because, well, man, is that going to crush our number? I think people still show up for that.
01:41:08.06 --> 01:41:12.70 I mean, it's like, is everybody, when you do this, you're like, well, I'm going to happen to me.
01:41:13.82 --> 01:41:21.10 Oh, I know. I mean, I, I, other guys, not me. I did the cake of form before every
01:41:21.10 --> 01:41:30.22 deployment and I was fully prepared as you can be as a spouse in the world we were living in.
01:41:30.22 --> 01:41:35.82 I mean, we attended many funerals in those last 10 years that my husband might not come home.
01:41:36.38 --> 01:41:40.54 And if he doesn't come home, he's going to come home and a call from with the flag over it.
01:41:40.54 --> 01:42:05.58 That's not what I got. So where does it go towards the end? What do you
01:42:05.58 --> 01:42:13.42 see towards the end? One of the biggest things was, well, he started putting on weight and, you
01:42:13.42 --> 01:42:18.38 know, he would joke because he was over 40 and he's like, you don't love me anymore because I'm
01:42:19.10 --> 01:42:25.66 getting heavy, which would never be the case. But he started running weight, but what really
01:42:25.66 --> 01:42:30.86 started to happen and pretty drastically, I would say the last six months that I can look back
01:42:30.86 --> 01:42:38.38 now is he got really puffy. His face got puffy almost like the sounds terrible like,
01:42:38.38 --> 01:42:43.66 have you ever seen a fish in water instead and it's kind of like bloated? That's always face got.
01:42:44.54 --> 01:42:52.62 And, and I, he also is weird as this is, I would always kind of kiss him on his temple and he
01:42:52.62 --> 01:43:02.94 didn't smell the same. And I thought, oh, that's weird. Well, I've learned since then a lot more about
01:43:02.94 --> 01:43:11.90 the way the brain's affected and to go back to that kind of systemic derailment. When you have a
01:43:11.90 --> 01:43:18.94 blast injury, you know, it's, it's a wave, right? It goes through the air and basically your brain
01:43:18.94 --> 01:43:23.98 shakes up inside your skull and that's what it's built to do. That's why we have a skull and that's
01:43:23.98 --> 01:43:29.26 how it's made. But it's not made to get that over and over again. So when that happens and they're
01:43:29.26 --> 01:43:35.98 swelling in the brain, it then starts to affect everything else because the brain is connected to the
01:43:35.98 --> 01:43:44.46 rest of your body and you see where not only hormones get derail, but, you know, your metabolism gets
01:43:44.46 --> 01:43:50.62 jacked up. So the guy is start to gain weight and when your metabolism gets jacked up, it also messes with
01:43:50.62 --> 01:43:55.90 the ketones in your body which would be like, you know, factoring it with your urine and different
01:43:55.90 --> 01:44:02.06 things and that's what changes the way they smell. And the puffiness is because we'll sure if he's
01:44:02.06 --> 01:44:07.58 got brain injury and there's any swelling or there's just systemic swelling in the body,
01:44:07.58 --> 01:44:15.34 it's got to go somewhere and so we start to notice it in the face and again, I didn't know any
01:44:15.34 --> 01:44:20.86 of this stuff prior and that's not to say someone listening, you're sitting there and you look
01:44:20.86 --> 01:44:26.06 over at your husband. You're like, my husband's face is puffy, but there's something to be said
01:44:26.06 --> 01:44:37.42 that PTSD is a genuine thing. I believe I also believe it's overused a lot and this is a whole
01:44:37.42 --> 01:44:46.54 step further than PTSD. Well, and also you're talking about it's not just hey, your face is
01:44:46.54 --> 01:44:52.62 puffy, we have an issue. No, it's this, this, this, this, this, you add all these things together
01:44:52.62 --> 01:44:58.22 and you get that many red flags. Yeah. Then that's, you know, you've got the, the, the, the, the
01:44:58.22 --> 01:45:04.06 the, the, the, the, the, the, the, you smell different. Hey, you're not talking, hey,
01:45:04.06 --> 01:45:08.86 you know, you're, you're, you're, you're not working out as much as you should just start adding
01:45:08.86 --> 01:45:14.14 all these red flags together and it's like, okay, you know, we have, we have, we have to address this.
01:45:14.14 --> 01:45:19.74 Well, and, and when you think about the different parts of the brain, you've got your, your
01:45:19.74 --> 01:45:23.82 limbic brain, your monkey brain, deep inside, that's what tells you what's safe.
01:45:23.82 --> 01:45:27.26 Is this dangerous? Is this why we don't walk into the street, right? We know that's dangerous.
01:45:27.26 --> 01:45:35.66 The prefrontal cortex kind of is, hmm, how do I feel about that? So if, if the brain is affected,
01:45:35.66 --> 01:45:42.54 that's when we see them, you know, the short fuse, how do I feel, I'm angry, I'm aggressive,
01:45:42.54 --> 01:45:48.86 maybe I'm sad, different emotions, but when it's brain injury and we've heard CTE, right,
01:45:48.86 --> 01:45:54.94 punch drunk, NFL players, our guys get it too. Our guys are getting interface,
01:45:54.94 --> 01:46:02.38 astral glial scarring, and that's almost like think of like a ricochet, almost bullets through
01:46:02.38 --> 01:46:08.46 the brain, and that's what comes from the blast injury, and that's able to penetrate that deep
01:46:08.46 --> 01:46:13.98 monkey brain of like, is this safe for me? And that's why guys make decisions that are really,
01:46:13.98 --> 01:46:23.10 really bad, whether it's, you know, drinking too much, um, in fidelity or, you know, I have a friend
01:46:23.10 --> 01:46:33.26 who he's good now, but he had his daughter in the car and had been drinking and was
01:46:34.38 --> 01:46:42.22 speeding well far above the speed limit. Any father would know, none of that is good,
01:46:43.74 --> 01:46:51.74 but he wasn't able to make the right decision. So, so I started to see
01:46:51.74 --> 01:47:00.54 looking back, I can see how he had changed, and I've shared with Jason to Chad
01:47:02.06 --> 01:47:10.54 climbed Mount Auckland, Cogua in January and of 2018, and that's the second highest summit in
01:47:10.54 --> 01:47:15.58 the world. It's the highest in South America, it's in Argentina, and he went and climbed this,
01:47:15.58 --> 01:47:24.78 it's a little over 23,000 feet, and I will never know, but I do believe that him climbing that
01:47:24.78 --> 01:47:33.58 mountain exacerbated any of his brain injuries that he had, and I've since talked to
01:47:36.38 --> 01:47:42.62 a doctor who I respect highly. She's been studying blast injuries in Cosevo soldiers since the
01:47:42.62 --> 01:47:47.90 early 90s, or at least that's who she started with, and I asked her about that, and she,
01:47:48.94 --> 01:47:53.42 you know, again, she didn't test Chad's brain, but she was pretty confident that that was
01:47:53.42 --> 01:47:59.34 probably the case too. Yeah, I mean, how long was that? That's going to be a couple weeks at least
01:47:59.34 --> 01:48:06.78 of a three-week evolution. Yeah, and it was lack of a two-highly, stranyous. Yeah, and so now you've
01:48:06.78 --> 01:48:13.98 got this brain that's injured, what encourages healing in the body blood, blood flow, right? You
01:48:13.98 --> 01:48:18.14 have surgery, okay, cool, you need surgery, once you get up, once you move your knee, because we got
01:48:18.14 --> 01:48:22.22 to get blood flow to it, because we're going to heal, right? Brain's injured, wait, now I'm going to
01:48:22.22 --> 01:48:27.26 go up 23,000 feet, and I'm going to be without oxygen, it really needs to heal itself. Yeah,
01:48:27.26 --> 01:48:35.50 one of my, um, the guys go through the hyperbaric chamber, right, which is just O2, pressure O2.
01:48:35.50 --> 01:48:41.34 It's the opposite of climbing a 23,000 foot mountain, and it provides a lot of healing, a lot of healing
01:48:41.34 --> 01:48:48.14 to guys. So to have to do the opposite of that, I mean, it seems. I asked her about that, and she said,
01:48:48.46 --> 01:48:53.34 I said, is that something that would help, and she said, yes, but not initially after injury?
01:48:53.34 --> 01:48:57.66 I mean, we're talking different things, because you're talking about guys that've been back for a while,
01:48:57.66 --> 01:49:07.42 and we do see people who have a little bit exacerbated symptoms at a higher elevation. My
01:49:07.42 --> 01:49:14.38 best friend's husband, they live in Colorado, and I said to the doctor, I said, what would you say,
01:49:14.38 --> 01:49:22.38 if there was a 20 year Navy seal veteran who's done upwards of probably 10 deployments,
01:49:22.38 --> 01:49:31.18 without a doubt, probably does have some some brain blast injury and lives at 8 to 10,000 feet,
01:49:31.18 --> 01:49:35.02 and before I could even finish the sentence, she just shook her head, no, no, she's kept shaking her
01:49:35.02 --> 01:49:43.02 head, no, and she said, bad, bad, very bad. I'd tell him to move. What was Chad's,
01:49:44.30 --> 01:49:50.30 like debrief points on the mountain climb? What do you say about it? He said it was really hard,
01:49:50.30 --> 01:49:59.98 really hard. I think he was really proud of himself for doing it, but when he came home and walked
01:49:59.98 --> 01:50:06.70 in the door, I mean, he was so skinny, just, you know, what do you about lose 15, 20 pounds?
01:50:06.70 --> 01:50:12.62 Probably, and he came in, and he just said, baby, that was really freaking hard,
01:50:13.26 --> 01:50:18.22 and I just didn't really ever hear him say that about anything. Like, it was like, oh,
01:50:18.22 --> 01:50:22.86 well, you did it, you know, a good job, and he said, didn't always next.
01:50:24.94 --> 01:50:31.26 That was his plan. And when was that, that wasn't January of 2018? Yeah.
01:50:33.66 --> 01:50:38.30 And how about the interactions? Like, with the kids at this point, the family, like,
01:50:39.42 --> 01:50:44.38 is it, you notice, and more? Is it plateaued out?
01:50:44.38 --> 01:50:49.34 Well, at this point, it's with teenagers, and I remember saying to him,
01:50:50.38 --> 01:50:55.02 they don't even want to like hang out with us or be home, anything. And he's like,
01:50:55.02 --> 01:51:04.46 I don't want to hang out with my parents when I was 14, 17. We did take a family trip that June of
01:51:04.46 --> 01:51:13.50 2018, we went to the Grand Canyon. And again, I look back at those pictures, and he definitely was not there.
01:51:13.50 --> 01:51:24.70 Like, he wasn't on the trip. You know what I mean? He was obviously there. But we stayed in a couple
01:51:24.70 --> 01:51:28.78 different cities. We kind of jumped around Arizona for a while, and you know, we're staying in this
01:51:28.78 --> 01:51:33.34 really nice hotel, and he didn't want to leave the room. You know, it's the Grand of its June and
01:51:33.34 --> 01:51:37.82 Arizona, so it is very, very hot. But, you know, he didn't really want to come down to the pool.
01:51:38.22 --> 01:51:42.38 He just wanted to sit in the room. And you're like, okay, but we're on a family vacation. And
01:51:42.38 --> 01:51:51.10 one time he was sitting down by the pool, and I saw him from a distance, and he just was kind of like
01:51:51.10 --> 01:51:57.74 leaned over in the chair, just like zoned in out. He was just not there. And I said, I walked up. I said,
01:51:57.74 --> 01:52:04.14 hey, what are you doing? He's like, nothing. Just, yeah, just things like that. He just wasn't,
01:52:04.14 --> 01:52:20.54 I don't know what he was thinking about. So where's the go from there?
01:52:20.54 --> 01:52:35.90 Well, and in the timeline? Yeah. Yeah. So he, he this year in 2018, I think, is when it started. He switched
01:52:35.90 --> 01:52:46.30 squadron, so he was moving around within the command. And he, he said that he didn't think that
01:52:46.30 --> 01:52:51.42 this is what he was supposed to be doing. I remember him saying, I just, I don't think this is right.
01:52:51.42 --> 01:52:56.86 I don't think this is really the path I'm supposed to be on. And again, he didn't really share a lot with me.
01:52:57.66 --> 01:53:04.46 And he, and I said, well, you're someone who's always accomplished every goal you've ever set for
01:53:04.46 --> 01:53:11.18 yourself. You make a goal. You go do it. So he had this goal for himself. He had, was in the process.
01:53:11.18 --> 01:53:16.94 I guess, of attaining the goal. And I said, maybe this is just the first time you change your mind.
01:53:16.94 --> 01:53:20.78 Like, you just don't want to do it. That's okay. You can, you can decide to change your mind. And
01:53:21.10 --> 01:53:26.78 he was like, well, they've spent so much time and money on, on doing this. And again, he didn't
01:53:26.78 --> 01:53:30.22 tell me any details. And he said he goes, I know I'm not really telling you much, but it makes me feel
01:53:30.22 --> 01:53:34.70 good to talk about it. And I was like, okay, because if he's gunna talk, I'm going to listen.
01:53:34.70 --> 01:53:43.18 And yeah, so something was bugging him. And I don't, I don't know what, but something was really
01:53:43.18 --> 01:53:51.02 bugging him. And at the beginning of October, he started hanging up his awards and things in the
01:53:51.02 --> 01:53:57.90 house, which he never did before. So we had, you know, like a lot of guys, he'll plaques and awards
01:53:57.90 --> 01:54:04.78 and he has a silver star and a maybe Marine Corps medal and a bronze star and all the things.
01:54:05.82 --> 01:54:11.98 And we had them all framed years ago, but he never hung them up. And he just thought it was really
01:54:11.98 --> 01:54:16.54 weird to hang that stuff up in your house. Because he said, what's someone's going to come in the house.
01:54:16.54 --> 01:54:22.46 And it's just like, look at me. And I always thought that was weird that he had to struggle with that.
01:54:22.46 --> 01:54:30.30 But yeah, he hung him up in our stairwell to our house. So maybe like you and your wife,
01:54:30.30 --> 01:54:37.34 marriage is a compromise, right? And I thought, you know, almost no one comes in our house anyway.
01:54:37.34 --> 01:54:42.46 And if someone were to come in our house, the only way they would see him is if they went up our stairs
01:54:42.46 --> 01:54:47.90 basically to our bedrooms. But in my mind, I just thought, well, at least he's hanging him up,
01:54:47.90 --> 01:54:54.86 so they're not going to get like broken or busted or anything. And he talked about hanging a
01:54:54.86 --> 01:55:02.94 Somali flag on one wall, what you would have seen when you come in the front door. And I just
01:55:02.94 --> 01:55:09.02 remember thinking, that's so weird. And I thought he was really messing with me. And when I turned
01:55:09.02 --> 01:55:14.46 around to kind of laugh, I realized he was serious. He was dead serious. And he was like, yeah, I guess that's
01:55:14.46 --> 01:55:23.18 dumb, huh? And I was like, well, maybe I asked him if he was okay. I remember kneeling down in
01:55:23.18 --> 01:55:32.30 front of Elman, I said, are you okay? And he said, yeah, okay. But if there was any sort of
01:55:34.06 --> 01:55:42.06 like first feeling, it was like he's off. I would have never thought three weeks later, he would
01:55:42.06 --> 01:55:50.78 take his life, but that's what happened. So it's interesting. And while I, I won't share
01:55:50.78 --> 01:55:59.66 her story, I, my other girlfriend will tell you who knew that her husband was struggling about
01:55:59.66 --> 01:56:07.98 two months prior. There was just like a switch. Two months and he was gone. So for me, I think it was
01:56:07.98 --> 01:56:15.90 three weeks and he was gone. I think they just meet this like threshold. And I don't know how we
01:56:15.90 --> 01:56:24.94 figure out where that is. That's going to be half to left to scientists. But, but there is some
01:56:24.94 --> 01:56:33.10 threshold that happens and then the switch is flipped. And it's still going to work. I mean,
01:56:33.10 --> 01:56:39.02 this, you kneeled down in front of them. You say, are you okay? He says, yeah, do you buy it?
01:56:41.58 --> 01:56:47.82 You want to buy it? I did buy it. And this again is one of those post-death struggles
01:56:49.18 --> 01:56:56.46 when someone takes their life, you military or not. You are left with so many questions. And I think
01:56:56.46 --> 01:57:09.18 that's, that's the beast to not have answers. And I believed him because there is nothing I didn't tell
01:57:09.18 --> 01:57:18.06 him. So I believed that if there was something he needed to tell me, he would tell me.
01:57:20.70 --> 01:57:25.42 And then he goes into work. Yeah. He went into work. He had a, he had a, he had a work trip three
01:57:25.42 --> 01:57:31.02 week before. This is when he gets really weird. So he had a work trip. And he could drive there.
01:57:31.02 --> 01:57:35.58 And he was supposed to come home on a Friday. And he called me on a Thursday. They had used
01:57:35.58 --> 01:57:40.70 rental cars to go up there. And he said, hey, I'm coming home early. Can you pick me up
01:57:41.74 --> 01:57:49.50 from the rental car place, forever? And I was like, oh, okay. And pick him up. He,
01:57:49.50 --> 01:57:57.50 we had to take her, I had to go get my son from a football game. So I drive him back home. And he
01:57:57.50 --> 01:58:02.54 instantly comes in the house. So Chad had been doing had had a concealed carry license. And he'd been
01:58:03.58 --> 01:58:08.54 roll him with a concealed carry, you know, when he's home around town for probably the last year or
01:58:08.54 --> 01:58:15.18 two. And again, I didn't really think much of it because I mean, well, crap is a team guy. And
01:58:15.18 --> 01:58:23.66 this is America. So we come home and he instantly goes to the safe and gets his gun. And I said,
01:58:23.66 --> 01:58:28.70 it was just kind of frantic. And I said, you realize that we're going on a school to pick up
01:58:28.70 --> 01:58:34.46 cuts. And he said, I'm not getting out of the car. And it was very like short. And I was like, okay.
01:58:35.02 --> 01:58:42.78 So we go, no big deal. In the whole time he's in the cities, just like, he just seemed uncomfortable.
01:58:42.78 --> 01:58:50.54 Um, I learned later that, and I don't know any details of whatever he was doing, but he was in a
01:58:50.54 --> 01:59:00.30 course, and he withdrew from the course. I he never quit anything. He never like stepped down from
01:59:00.30 --> 01:59:07.82 anything I'd ever known. So that conversation about, I'm not sure I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing.
01:59:07.82 --> 01:59:18.46 That came later that night when he got home. And this was on a Thursday. And on Friday, I had to leave
01:59:18.46 --> 01:59:25.18 to go. I was working out in Raleigh. I could drive there for a seminar. Across it seminar. Yeah.
01:59:25.18 --> 01:59:31.66 And we talked about it that he needed to call his doctor because he felt like he just needed to check in,
01:59:31.66 --> 01:59:35.98 like maybe his testosterone was off. Maybe he's something. He's like, he wasn't feeling good.
01:59:35.98 --> 01:59:40.30 Earlier that week, he told me that he had some headaches and like some stomach aches. He had said he
01:59:40.30 --> 01:59:47.50 didn't feel good, which again, Chad never said. I mean, I don't know if ever he said, I don't feel good.
01:59:47.50 --> 01:59:51.10 I mean, he didn't say it like that, but he would never say that to me. But he did. He didn't feel good.
01:59:51.66 --> 01:59:55.90 And so the deal was when I left, he was going to make an appointment with his doctor and he was
01:59:55.90 --> 02:00:01.34 going to make an appointment to talk to his boss about whatever his work situation was to try to
02:00:01.34 --> 02:00:08.54 figure out what his path was going to be. And I left. I told our kids, hey, you know, dad's kind
02:00:08.54 --> 02:00:14.38 of stressed out just just saying, no, he's got a lot on his plate right now. And when I left,
02:00:14.38 --> 02:00:19.98 I'm leaving Virginia Beach and I just had this like gut and like pit in my stomach. Like I just
02:00:19.98 --> 02:00:30.06 felt like I shouldn't be leaving him. But I did. And went to Raleigh, worked, talked him on Saturday.
02:00:30.06 --> 02:00:37.74 And on Sunday, kids like called and said that dad's acting really weird and he's just laying
02:00:37.74 --> 02:00:49.26 on the landing and he's just staring at the ceiling. And I just, I just, that's just weird.
02:00:50.54 --> 02:00:56.86 That's just weird. And I was for his way and I had to work still full seminar and
02:00:56.86 --> 02:01:09.98 I just knew I had to get home. So the seminar finishes and I get in the car as quick as I can
02:01:09.98 --> 02:01:16.70 and try to raise home and he called me at one point and he just said, I love you. And I kind of
02:01:16.70 --> 02:01:23.74 laughed at him and I said, I love you too. And he's like, no, I mean, I really love you. I love you so much.
02:01:23.74 --> 02:01:30.38 I love you so much, Sarah. And he knew I loved it when he would say my name. And I said, you know,
02:01:30.38 --> 02:01:35.26 I love you too, but can I call you back? I really bad headache. And honestly, I was just really
02:01:35.26 --> 02:01:42.30 trying to get home. So fast forward a couple hours later, I get home and I go in the house and
02:01:43.82 --> 02:01:50.06 he's upstairs and he's rummaging below the bed for something and I come in and he turns to me
02:01:50.06 --> 02:02:00.14 and I hug him and kiss him and he kind of just like, like, collapses in my arms a little bit.
02:02:00.14 --> 02:02:07.34 So I just hug him for a second and I just think of my mind, well, I'm home now. So I'm near you.
02:02:07.34 --> 02:02:13.26 And I'm going to try to just, I didn't think at the time that I needed to necessarily keep you safe.
02:02:13.26 --> 02:02:22.46 I thought I just had to keep you close and make you feel better. And so I got, I had to get a shower
02:02:22.46 --> 02:02:26.14 and I said, come talk to me while I'm in the shower. And when I went around in the bathroom to start the
02:02:26.14 --> 02:02:32.38 shower, he wasn't right behind me and I looked out the door and he had just like collapsed like face
02:02:32.38 --> 02:02:36.46 first on the bed, kind of like the letter T, like arms out to the side, has his head just
02:02:36.46 --> 02:02:43.18 side like, like just exhaustion. And I said, what what are you doing? Come on, come in. And so I
02:02:43.18 --> 02:02:50.86 get in the shower and he's sitting on the bathtub and he just had been over and he's got his hands on
02:02:50.86 --> 02:02:55.74 either side of his head and he's holding this hair and he's kind of like gripping his hair and
02:02:55.74 --> 02:03:01.34 I kept saying what's wrong, you know, what's going on and he got to talk to me and he just kept
02:03:01.34 --> 02:03:12.14 saying I don't know. Anyway, I asked him to pass me a towel and he looked at me and he was not.
02:03:13.98 --> 02:03:19.50 He wasn't there. His eyes were just like, I was just like looking straight through his eyes.
02:03:20.70 --> 02:03:26.06 And I just lay down with him and bed and I just thought if I could keep him next to me then
02:03:26.06 --> 02:03:36.14 he would feel better. But that wasn't the case. So I woke up in the middle of the night and he was
02:03:36.14 --> 02:03:43.98 standing there dressed looking out the window and I said what are you doing? And he just said,
02:03:43.98 --> 02:03:52.78 I don't know. I said, well, come lay back and bed with me and he did and the next morning,
02:03:52.78 --> 02:04:00.38 early, I woke up. I woke up to see just him walking out the door. I saw like the back of his shoulder
02:04:01.10 --> 02:04:11.10 leave leave. And I, I, it's like I couldn't talk. It was like I couldn't get up. I don't know if it's
02:04:11.10 --> 02:04:16.86 just because I was sleepy or what or I wasn't really processing like, oh, he's leaving right now
02:04:16.86 --> 02:04:24.30 and then I couldn't find him. So I woke up, you know, a little while later I couldn't find him.
02:04:25.10 --> 02:04:31.82 So I looked around and I thought, well, maybe he went for a walk. Maybe he went for a run.
02:04:31.82 --> 02:04:36.22 Maybe he went to go get coffee. How did I call him? He didn't answer. I texted him. He didn't answer.
02:04:38.38 --> 02:04:44.86 And went round in my head trying to figure out where it could be. I got in my car at one point.
02:04:44.86 --> 02:04:49.66 I thought I'll drive around and then I thought, where am I? Where literally, like which direction would I drive?
02:04:49.66 --> 02:04:53.18 What's happening? Thought, well, did he leave for work? You supposed to leave on a work trip?
02:04:54.14 --> 02:05:00.38 But I figured he was also going to talk to his boss. So, you know, did he go to work? I just didn't know.
02:05:01.02 --> 02:05:07.50 I called his dad. But because he was so weird the night before I just thought it was weird that he left and he didn't
02:05:07.50 --> 02:05:15.18 say bye. He never didn't not kiss me goodbye. Never. He actually would do this. I'd be upstairs and he'd say,
02:05:15.18 --> 02:05:19.34 okay, bye. I'll see you later and he would slam a door in the house just to see me
02:05:20.14 --> 02:05:26.54 run down furiously down the steps because he knew I would get so spun up if he left and didn't kiss me.
02:05:26.54 --> 02:05:39.50 So, I don't know what I was thinking. I just know I wanted I just wanted confirmation of where he was
02:05:40.30 --> 02:05:47.26 and I finally called the command and I talked to the psych there and
02:05:47.26 --> 02:05:56.94 she asked me a bunch of questions. One of the questions she asked was how does he feel about
02:05:57.74 --> 02:06:03.74 and he asked he said chat's boss's name and I felt that was a really weird question
02:06:06.38 --> 02:06:11.58 because another thing I really loved about chat is he really never said anything bad about people.
02:06:11.58 --> 02:06:18.86 So, you know, if he liked you or didn't like you, I didn't really know. That's how he walked and
02:06:19.66 --> 02:06:30.22 I was like, I have no idea. But she, she just kind of let me think he's on his way to work.
02:06:30.22 --> 02:06:34.86 You know, like he's probably left and he's on the straining trip and a little while later I
02:06:34.86 --> 02:06:39.34 had talked to her again and I said, you know, everything's here. His toothbrush is here. His medicine
02:06:39.34 --> 02:06:45.02 is here. His sunglasses are here. He wouldn't leave with all that stuff and she told me
02:06:46.54 --> 02:06:51.02 due to the privacy of his job. It would be likely that he wouldn't be answering his cell phone.
02:06:53.02 --> 02:07:03.02 And I said, okay, so like the wife that I was, I kind of just thought, okay, so he must have gone
02:07:03.02 --> 02:07:07.82 and it was driving trip up the coast a little bit. So I thought, okay, he was supposed to be back the next day
02:07:07.82 --> 02:07:19.58 and so I think about that and my kids came home from school that day and they said, where's dad?
02:07:20.38 --> 02:07:24.54 And I said, oh, I don't know. I think he left on this work trip. He should be home tomorrow. And I'm
02:07:24.54 --> 02:07:29.90 saying that almost feeling like I'm lying because I don't believe it. But I'm trying to believe it
02:07:29.90 --> 02:07:40.54 because that's what I was told and why wouldn't you, right? So this point, you know, he disappears
02:07:40.54 --> 02:07:49.34 Monday morning, probably I'm saying somewhere between three and six AM and Monday goes by,
02:07:49.34 --> 02:07:55.42 we started demolition on our house. We were doing renovations. That started that day and Tuesday
02:07:55.42 --> 02:08:03.34 comes and I went my house sits near a lake. You can see it from my front porch and I went for a run
02:08:05.18 --> 02:08:10.86 and this is why I'm sharing it. It'll make sense in a minute. But I went for a run and I ran past the
02:08:10.86 --> 02:08:15.26 lake down the bike path all around and I was going to sit at the lake from an end of October.
02:08:15.26 --> 02:08:20.14 It's Virginia Beach. The weather was really beautiful that day and I was going to sit on the bench
02:08:20.14 --> 02:08:26.54 at that lake. But I didn't because I wanted to go inside and shower and like curl my hair and look
02:08:26.54 --> 02:08:33.82 nice for winning at home. So I did that and dropped my son off at a friend's house. He's going to play
02:08:34.30 --> 02:08:39.82 going to a football game. And as I was pulling back in, a psych from work called and said,
02:08:39.82 --> 02:08:47.42 ma'am, your husband didn't report to a master. We're heightening the alert. And I said, that's bad.
02:08:47.42 --> 02:08:53.18 That's bad. That's very bad. And I pretty sure I hung up the phone on him. And when I got out of my car,
02:08:53.18 --> 02:09:02.70 so now where my car was, it's in this coldest acne or buy and it's facing that lake and my house
02:09:02.70 --> 02:09:07.98 is on the left and as I'm walking up to my house, the head contractor for the renovations comes out
02:09:07.98 --> 02:09:11.58 and he says, ma'am, there's two police officers at your back door.
02:09:11.58 --> 02:09:25.50 I called my best friend Courtney, her husband and my husband were in Buds together. And I said,
02:09:26.06 --> 02:09:35.50 you need to come to my house right now. And I just hung up phone. And I didn't know what was going
02:09:35.50 --> 02:09:41.50 on. I just thought something is like seriously. And I went in my front door and out my back door
02:09:41.50 --> 02:09:47.34 the way the house is and there were two cops in my garage and they were, we stood outside the door
02:09:47.34 --> 02:09:54.30 and they said, ma'am, do you know where your husband is? And I said, no, I can't find him and I haven't
02:09:54.30 --> 02:09:59.74 been able to find him. And I asked him if they could move farther down into the street because we were
02:09:59.74 --> 02:10:05.98 right underneath my daughter's window and I knew that she was upstairs and I just didn't want her to be.
02:10:06.54 --> 02:10:13.42 I just didn't know what was happening. So we moved on to the street and
02:10:18.30 --> 02:10:25.50 this cop just opens his door and he like dig something and I have this car and he just turned
02:10:25.50 --> 02:10:30.14 the police. And he said, ma'am, I'm really sorry to tell you but we found your husband and he took his life.
02:10:35.90 --> 02:10:37.18 And now is all alone.
02:10:42.46 --> 02:10:44.30 So, right, right.
02:10:44.30 --> 02:10:55.02 I ran about that time. Courtney pulled up. Sorry. Sorry.
02:10:59.26 --> 02:11:06.38 Courtney pulled up and I think I was screaming and she bare hugged me from behind and I think
02:11:06.38 --> 02:11:13.50 we pretty much took her to the ground, I think. And she said, you don't know that. So she screamed at him.
02:11:13.50 --> 02:11:22.38 You don't know that. Well, he's taken his life at that lake and he could see her house from where he was.
02:11:23.98 --> 02:11:37.98 At least that's what they tell me. So, my daughter's upstairs in her room by herself and she can see
02:11:37.98 --> 02:11:45.74 in here everything. And my son is at a friend's house and I think pretty sure my neighbor went to pick him up.
02:11:47.02 --> 02:12:07.26 So he told me son. So, I have to understand like logistically speaking, there's a lot of things that just
02:12:07.26 --> 02:12:18.30 don't make sense. Where my car was when I got out of it and that guy said the cops were at the back door.
02:12:20.54 --> 02:12:26.22 If they had just found his body, I didn't see anybody over by that lake.
02:12:26.22 --> 02:12:44.22 It had been like 36 hours since I couldn't find them. We went back later and I do think he was at the lake.
02:12:44.22 --> 02:12:50.94 And this is why we went back later in our neighborhood so many people have cameras on their house
02:12:50.94 --> 02:13:01.42 and there's footage of Chad and the bike path that lines that lake if you walk to it at kind of T's and if you go left
02:13:01.42 --> 02:13:10.14 it takes you all the way up to the main road that cars go in and out of the neighborhood. And I think we timed it so that
02:13:10.14 --> 02:13:21.34 cameras caught him walking that way and that would have been right at the same time he would have watched our kids leave for school.
02:13:27.42 --> 02:13:39.74 So, when um, when this is happening, when this is getting like, when when when
02:13:39.74 --> 02:13:46.62 he leaves in the morning and you start thinking like where is he? Is there any part of your brain that's thinking
02:13:46.62 --> 02:13:51.66 he could kill himself? No. So, well, I take that back.
02:13:51.66 --> 02:14:08.06 I did ask Chad's dad. I was trying to get into the safe. So, I guess there was a part of me that did but
02:14:10.54 --> 02:14:14.94 this, he, this was a little farther on in the morning. So, when I first couldn't find him I just
02:14:14.94 --> 02:14:19.82 couldn't find up in the napkin or a while, I think it might have been his dad that said have you checked the
02:14:19.82 --> 02:14:29.58 safe? And so, it took me a minute to try to remember the combo and I got in there and to my knowledge
02:14:29.58 --> 02:14:38.46 all the guns were there but apparently they weren't. I guess the reason I'm asking you that is because
02:14:39.90 --> 02:14:45.18 I don't know various conversations in my, I've had in my life with various people at various times
02:14:45.18 --> 02:14:52.94 and the conversation is something like, you know, you know, that little exploration of
02:14:54.14 --> 02:14:59.82 wait, I'm worried about him and then there'll be some kind of an explanation like,
02:15:00.78 --> 02:15:08.94 what do you mean? Well, I'm just worried like he might kill himself and then the conversation is
02:15:08.94 --> 02:15:19.02 he would never do that. Right? So, that idea of we think we know, we think we know what someone's
02:15:19.02 --> 02:15:26.06 going through, we think we know what's going on in their heads and I think that we don't know,
02:15:26.06 --> 02:15:34.30 we don't always know and, you know, like, he disappears, you know, like what, that's what I was
02:15:34.30 --> 02:15:40.78 just thinking like, what was that in your head of like, hey, you know what, he's, you know, he
02:15:40.78 --> 02:15:45.66 probably is going to see his parents or he's, you know, going to go freaking surfing or whatever he's
02:15:45.66 --> 02:15:58.22 going to do but this crazy idea that he might go kill himself. It seems so unbelievable, you know,
02:15:59.10 --> 02:16:03.42 for someone that's like, hey, he's been through whatever, 10 deployments. He's done all this.
02:16:03.42 --> 02:16:07.74 He's done this. He's done that. We got kids. We got a house. We got all these things going on. All these
02:16:07.74 --> 02:16:14.38 good things going on in our lives. That's not, that's not going to happen. And it seems like
02:16:14.38 --> 02:16:21.02 oftentimes people are caught off guard by it. People are caught off guard and I know you mentioned a
02:16:21.02 --> 02:16:28.38 couple of friends where there was real signs of, you know, hey, not things aren't going good for
02:16:28.38 --> 02:16:34.38 the individual but a lot of times I hear it's like, you know, there's been some suicides in the
02:16:34.38 --> 02:16:47.50 seal community where there was no indication at all, at all of any kind. And it seems like we're
02:16:47.50 --> 02:17:05.42 conditioned to sort of not even think that it's a feasible thing. I, guilt. I, you know, I was just as bad as,
02:17:07.10 --> 02:17:15.42 as the military makes the guys out to be because as I said in his funeral,
02:17:15.42 --> 02:17:28.38 to me, Chad was unbreakable. I mean, to me, he had done all these really amazing things in
02:17:28.38 --> 02:17:38.14 his life. He, he's, you know, he, everything he did, he did well, everything he did. And
02:17:38.14 --> 02:17:45.26 it's seal, you know, great ridiculous high GPA when he's going night school and he has a life and a
02:17:45.26 --> 02:17:52.70 baby and really good in sniper school and went and got his project manager license certification,
02:17:52.70 --> 02:17:58.62 all that in the business world. And whatever, fill in the blank, climbing mountains,
02:17:59.42 --> 02:18:07.02 qualifying for the CrossFit games, like insert whatever, he just was so unbreakable to me. And,
02:18:07.02 --> 02:18:16.38 and I guess that's part of my, what I want people to recognize with your person is that
02:18:17.74 --> 02:18:23.74 they are, they're Navy seals, but at the end of the day, you're just dudes, you know, your dudes,
02:18:23.74 --> 02:18:37.66 and humans, and with heart and conscience and dads and husbands and brothers and sons and, um,
02:18:37.98 --> 02:18:43.74 not unbreakable.
02:18:43.74 --> 02:18:50.14 So, I'm a book written by a guy named David Hackworth who is a Vietnam Korean War veteran and one of
02:18:50.14 --> 02:18:55.10 the things that he talks about is the fact that like people are different, right? And as you mentioned,
02:18:55.10 --> 02:19:00.06 people are different and something's in fact different people different ways and he described like
02:19:00.06 --> 02:19:06.70 there's a cop that people have and, and when it gets filled up with like the stress and the trauma,
02:19:08.46 --> 02:19:15.26 once it overflows like that's it. If you, if it overflows, that's it, like you, that's it. And
02:19:15.26 --> 02:19:20.30 different people have different sized cops and some people got a freaking five gallon jug and some
02:19:20.30 --> 02:19:29.18 people got a tea cup and everything in between and I compare that to another war veteran, Dick Winners,
02:19:29.18 --> 02:19:36.30 who is the character of Bandar Brothers, he was saying that, but he's got a book about about war as well
02:19:37.02 --> 02:19:42.86 and his big thing was like, when that cop, they use a different metaphor, but
02:19:42.86 --> 02:19:49.18 when the cop starts to get filled up, you need to get the person out of a situation and if you
02:19:49.18 --> 02:19:56.06 get him out of the situation, the cop like the the water will dissipate and it'll go back down
02:19:56.06 --> 02:20:01.50 and they can continue, they can go back, they can continue to perform their job. But same thing,
02:20:01.50 --> 02:20:08.30 if you let the cop overflow, then it's, it's, it's, can't you can't put the water back in there.
02:20:08.30 --> 02:20:13.18 You know, I always talk, when I talk to people about this kind of stuff, I talk about the
02:20:13.18 --> 02:20:19.26 check engine light in a car, right? If the check engine light comes on, you take it in for a service.
02:20:19.26 --> 02:20:24.22 You stop driving it and as long as you take it in for a service and it gets some downtime
02:20:24.22 --> 02:20:28.38 and the engine cools and you put in fresh oil, whatever the engine is going to be okay.
02:20:29.26 --> 02:20:32.94 But if the check engine light comes on and you just keep running that engine,
02:20:32.94 --> 02:20:40.78 you're going to burn that engine out and you'll destroy the engine. And you know, I think that
02:20:40.78 --> 02:20:45.50 all these things come into play and that's what makes this so difficult is everyone's just got
02:20:45.50 --> 02:20:50.38 a different size cup and everyone's got a different time that they're check engine light comes on
02:20:50.38 --> 02:20:55.42 and how much it's going to take to get that thing cooled back down and it makes it, it makes it so
02:20:55.42 --> 02:21:02.38 challenging to universally say, okay, well here's the limitation that people have. So I think what
02:21:02.38 --> 02:21:09.18 you're doing, talking about how to identify that check engine light so people can see it.
02:21:10.30 --> 02:21:18.38 And then also trying to help people to recognize that you've got to kind of, you've got to do
02:21:18.38 --> 02:21:21.82 your best to see your own check engine light and when that freaking thing comes on,
02:21:22.70 --> 02:21:25.74 you've got to do something about it. And if you don't do something about it,
02:21:25.74 --> 02:21:27.90 you're going to blow out the engine and then you're no good.
02:21:27.90 --> 02:21:37.58 Yeah, and as we've said a couple times that the guys don't want to worry the spouse or I say
02:21:37.58 --> 02:21:43.42 spouse or first responder like who's who is your go-to person, right? They don't want to worry the
02:21:43.42 --> 02:21:51.42 spouse, but if I were to ask someone that was struggling right now, maybe they're sitting there
02:21:51.42 --> 02:21:56.22 and they're they thought about taking their life and they say, I don't want to bother my spouse. I don't
02:21:56.22 --> 02:22:02.70 I would it would be better for her if I wasn't here and I can't speak to the relationships that
02:22:02.70 --> 02:22:10.14 people have, but sitting on this side of it, sorry, I didn't like total cry or today.
02:22:11.90 --> 02:22:22.22 He didn't even give me the chance to help. That hurts. So it's on one hand you can say,
02:22:22.22 --> 02:22:29.26 well he didn't want to burden you, you know, he just he didn't want to cause you any worry,
02:22:29.26 --> 02:22:35.98 but I mean look at where I am now. Did he not think that this wouldn't like devastate me forever?
02:22:36.54 --> 02:22:39.66 He didn't even give me the opportunity to like try to help.
02:22:41.50 --> 02:22:51.34 You know, Jacob, the hard part comes in when you've got guys who you're your bread not to talk about this
02:22:51.34 --> 02:22:57.90 stuff. It is constantly bread and the interesting part for me in this journey of learning
02:22:59.02 --> 02:23:04.30 Chad's story and my wife Emily and I get into to know Sarah and her family really well and
02:23:04.30 --> 02:23:11.58 going really into this issue is there's actually something that happens to your brain, right? This
02:23:11.58 --> 02:23:21.66 is not something where it's not like, oh, you know, I've just got this inexplicable weakness going on
02:23:21.66 --> 02:23:26.38 because that's what it is in the teams, right? It's like, oh that dude's weak if he goes and does this.
02:23:27.26 --> 02:23:34.46 And you know, but if you blow your back out or if you, you know, you get shot or if you do,
02:23:34.46 --> 02:23:42.38 you know, things that are acceptable injuries, you know, by team room standards of sorts, right?
02:23:43.10 --> 02:23:49.98 And the thing that's like, my best friend and basic training killed himself and I didn't unpack
02:23:49.98 --> 02:23:56.94 that at all, right? I mean his dad was a general and that was something that in my training,
02:23:56.94 --> 02:24:03.82 it's just, you know, I couldn't sit and think about this at all. It's like days of thunder, right?
02:24:03.82 --> 02:24:10.30 When, you know, coal gets, Tom Cruise gets injured, right? I mean the injured driver goes way over there
02:24:10.30 --> 02:24:16.86 and nobody ever wants to be around them. And for me personally, I had to just kind of take that and say,
02:24:16.86 --> 02:24:23.26 all right, I have a job to do and he was weak. Good friend of mine and he just, that's that could happen
02:24:23.26 --> 02:24:29.50 to him and there's something, what I told myself was there's something that he was born with
02:24:29.50 --> 02:24:35.82 that made him do that and this just kind of brought it to life. And when you hear Chad's story,
02:24:35.82 --> 02:24:41.50 if you think that you didn't hear the story, because, you know, that's the word of caution to the
02:24:41.50 --> 02:24:47.98 guys and our profession and to millions of Americans out there, right? The, this idea that
02:24:49.98 --> 02:24:55.02 you're born with this or you're not, I mean situation brought this, brought this out, right?
02:24:55.02 --> 02:25:02.30 It's chronic stress, chronic pain going on from injuries and just the way that you train,
02:25:02.30 --> 02:25:08.38 the way that, I mean it takes its toll and then that leads to all sorts of things and, you know,
02:25:08.38 --> 02:25:13.34 the brain is something that we don't really study that well. We don't study it much at all and,
02:25:13.34 --> 02:25:19.26 you know, it's one of those things where we're able to, you know, cure this virus almost a year
02:25:19.26 --> 02:25:25.18 later with a huge national surge because we give a shit in the matters and this is something
02:25:25.18 --> 02:25:31.58 that is just kind of still floating around over here. I mean, what's it going to take? We're losing
02:25:31.58 --> 02:25:38.54 our, some of our most valuable people in our country, right, to, to something that we just don't
02:25:38.54 --> 02:25:43.98 understand. But what I know, my mental shift is to say there wasn't one that of weakness in Chad
02:25:43.98 --> 02:25:49.02 Wilkinson. There was something that is inexplicable that we just have not explained yet that,
02:25:49.02 --> 02:25:56.46 that changed inside of him and some decision-making process, you know, it just, it changed
02:25:57.50 --> 02:26:02.94 and we have a long ways to go. Yeah, there's a famous football player from San Diego,
02:26:02.94 --> 02:26:09.90 a guy named Junior Sayow, have you heard of him? Oh yeah, like the most beloved, probably San Diego
02:26:09.90 --> 02:26:16.86 charger, maybe even the most beloved San Diego athlete, total stud, you know, a beast of a human,
02:26:18.06 --> 02:26:23.82 like a super nice guy. He was just, just this incredible human being. He returned from the
02:26:23.82 --> 02:26:32.46 NFL and killed himself. Like he had everything and, you know, that, that, that made me think of this,
02:26:32.46 --> 02:26:39.42 you know, Sarah, when you're like talking about Chad and when I've talked to people that,
02:26:40.62 --> 02:26:49.42 like our art depressed, straight up depressed, their heads in, in like this, their heads in a
02:26:49.42 --> 02:26:54.06 storm, their heads in like darkness and, and it's really like from the outside,
02:26:55.02 --> 02:26:59.26 you look at him and you think, oh yeah, well, hey, man, it's, you know, you're in this bad situation,
02:26:59.26 --> 02:27:03.82 but it's only, it's only just right around you and if you come over here a little bit,
02:27:03.82 --> 02:27:10.14 you'll be out of the storm, like, come on over, but from their perspective, no matter where they look,
02:27:10.14 --> 02:27:16.78 it's like darkness and they just see the storm and they don't see that if they can move forward
02:27:16.78 --> 02:27:21.34 more, they can go a little bit further and they don't see that everybody's on the outside going,
02:27:21.34 --> 02:27:26.62 hey, like, it's okay, man, it's super sunny and bright and like there's a rainbow over here and
02:27:26.62 --> 02:27:33.26 everything's cool, just, just, just move over here a little bit and they can't, they, they don't see it,
02:27:33.26 --> 02:27:36.86 they don't see it, they can't see it, they can't see it because it's there, that's what they're,
02:27:36.86 --> 02:27:42.54 that's what's around them and so like, it just causes them to do things that don't make any sense to
02:27:42.54 --> 02:27:47.82 us because we're looking at him from the outside going, hey, like, no, it's sunny, it's sunny,
02:27:47.82 --> 02:27:55.82 and they can't see it and it's like trying to convince people, it's almost impossible, it seems
02:27:55.82 --> 02:28:03.98 almost impossible to try and convince someone that that storm that they see 360 degrees around them,
02:28:03.98 --> 02:28:10.22 thunder, lightning, winds, that's what they see and to convince them that hey, man, right over here,
02:28:11.18 --> 02:28:15.58 it's sunny and it's nice beach day and it's 80 degrees and we're gonna, it's okay,
02:28:18.14 --> 02:28:25.66 they, they can't see it and it's so hard to get them out of that cloud and
02:28:25.66 --> 02:28:32.22 I think that's where people get stuck and it's so frustrating from the outside because
02:28:34.38 --> 02:28:38.94 we can see all that other good stuff that they just don't have the ability to see anymore.
02:28:38.94 --> 02:28:42.38 So I think it's like a combination, you know, you got like I said, Junior say, I'll
02:28:43.50 --> 02:28:48.94 what better life could that guy have set up for himself? You know, he's got
02:28:48.94 --> 02:28:55.18 everything that a person could want and yet he's in this cloud and it consumes him.
02:28:55.90 --> 02:29:01.10 I mean, so to Chad, right? I mean, I exact great family, great life, he had respect, hit honor,
02:29:02.06 --> 02:29:07.02 you know, everything, it doesn't get better than that, right? I mean, that's the
02:29:07.02 --> 02:29:13.34 currency when you're in that line of line of work. You just want, you want to be respected and
02:29:13.34 --> 02:29:20.30 you want them to think, oh, he's doing a good job and you know, you look at, you look at where
02:29:20.30 --> 02:29:27.02 he went and what he did, he had that and when you can't see it, there's just something else going on.
02:29:28.62 --> 02:29:34.14 Absolutely. And so when you kind of look at that, I mean, you know, it's like, what's the
02:29:34.14 --> 02:29:38.70 responsibility moving forward, right? I mean, there's some command responsibility. I'm not
02:29:38.70 --> 02:29:43.42 sitting here pointing fingers backwards. I'm sitting saying like, you know, part of what we want to do
02:29:43.42 --> 02:29:49.02 is educate the next, the next crop and I know you're huge on this as well and I mean,
02:29:50.14 --> 02:29:55.90 the hardest thing to do sometimes is it takes someone out of the game. So like, you know,
02:29:55.90 --> 02:30:00.86 we started this in football, you've got the concussion, measurements and if you get a concussion,
02:30:00.86 --> 02:30:04.86 you've got to come out and you know, if it's your star player, he's still got to come out.
02:30:04.86 --> 02:30:11.34 And you start to look at like, how are we doing this in the military, you know? We kind of say
02:30:11.34 --> 02:30:17.18 the military's not a social experiment because it's not. But the truth of the matter is is that
02:30:17.18 --> 02:30:23.10 when you get into these, especially units like DevGrew and Delta and SF, right? I mean,
02:30:23.10 --> 02:30:30.62 your job is to go win wars. I mean, this is not, that requires, I mean, the American Alpha male
02:30:30.62 --> 02:30:38.14 is very special kind of thing in the history of history and it requires a special type of training,
02:30:38.14 --> 02:30:47.10 it requires all sorts of things that make it very difficult to stop them from wanting to keep
02:30:47.10 --> 02:30:51.82 going after that. You just, you, it's like we're breeding it into them. So like you take American
02:30:51.82 --> 02:30:57.98 Alpha males and you make them more alpha. I mean, it's, it's quite impressive and you create these
02:30:57.98 --> 02:31:04.46 units. I mean, they're story units. I mean, DevGrew, SEAL Team 6, I mean, the SEALs, these are, these are,
02:31:05.66 --> 02:31:12.46 you know, it's very impressive. And so how do we, how do we protect the guys though?
02:31:13.58 --> 02:31:17.74 And I say this from a two-way street, you know, it's one thing is here and say, oh, you know,
02:31:18.14 --> 02:31:22.38 we got to know that if we're not sleeping well that there's something wrong and that's going to be a problem.
02:31:22.38 --> 02:31:27.82 Like, okay, I'm like, I'm like, I'm on a team on my get. Got it, right? Take another pill. Right?
02:31:27.82 --> 02:31:32.78 Work out a little harder. Maybe I'll sleep better. Yeah, good. You know? And it's like,
02:31:32.78 --> 02:31:38.54 that's not going to work. Right? It's not going to work. It's at some point we have to, we have to
02:31:38.54 --> 02:31:45.02 put more of a systematic approach in here to mental health. We've done that in SF, right? I mean,
02:31:45.02 --> 02:31:49.58 they're starting to treat green berets like professional athletes, which is great. You know,
02:31:49.58 --> 02:31:53.90 you've got a locker room, you've got, you know, the physical trainers, you get physicals, you get
02:31:53.90 --> 02:32:00.38 checked up, you get all these things. And you know, if we don't, then it's too much of the loss is in vain.
02:32:01.50 --> 02:32:06.70 Yeah, no, and they definitely are moving in that direction in the teams and the
02:32:06.70 --> 02:32:12.06 seal teams, like the baseline studies that they're doing. They are absolutely moving that direction.
02:32:12.06 --> 02:32:20.22 I mean, they have whole organizations within the organization that are focused on that. And yeah,
02:32:20.22 --> 02:32:26.06 I mean, their lessons have definitely been learned. That's great. I mean, Chad killed himself
02:32:26.06 --> 02:32:30.22 three years ago. Yeah. Like they were not moving. We're not moving fast enough. Here. I mean,
02:32:30.22 --> 02:32:34.86 the VA, you know what the budget is for veterans who saw I prevention, it's 10.2 billion.
02:32:34.86 --> 02:32:42.94 Wow. That's a big number. That is a big number. Right? And, you know, the VA gets just
02:32:42.94 --> 02:32:48.54 shit on all over the place, right? The VA is actually trying. I mean, if you look at budget,
02:32:48.54 --> 02:32:54.22 they're some trying, they're they're trying experimental stuff, anti-depressant nasal spray, right?
02:32:55.10 --> 02:33:00.94 Virtual reality-based suicide prevention training. I mean, these kinds of things, they are,
02:33:00.94 --> 02:33:10.46 there are things that we are trying. We as it a nation. And it's, at some point, you know,
02:33:11.74 --> 02:33:19.58 the guys that are close to the guys and, and gals, I don't want to exclude the female service
02:33:19.58 --> 02:33:24.06 members either because it affects them as well. I mean, you're actually statistically more likely
02:33:24.06 --> 02:33:27.42 to commit suicide if you did not deploy than if you did.
02:33:27.42 --> 02:33:37.18 Explain that again. So, if you did not, I mean, it's saying, you know, just because you were
02:33:37.18 --> 02:33:44.94 on seal team six or just because you saw intense combat, right? That's not a predictor of suicide.
02:33:44.94 --> 02:33:50.46 So, it might be a predictor of, you know, TBI and those kinds of things because, you know,
02:33:50.46 --> 02:33:55.74 if all you do is explosive breach charges next to doors all day long, I mean, you know, commanders
02:33:55.74 --> 02:34:01.18 have to figure out a way to limit that stuff. Like you can only do this so many times. I got it.
02:34:01.18 --> 02:34:06.14 You don't want the first one to be on, you know, the, the house down range. You have to work with
02:34:06.14 --> 02:34:11.66 live explosives. But, but at the same time, you can't, you can't just go through the same
02:34:12.06 --> 02:34:18.46 repetitions a million times. And, you know what I mean? The other part is you have your, your team
02:34:18.46 --> 02:34:25.66 time and you roll off a team and there's always guys behind you. And, and this is credit to America
02:34:25.66 --> 02:34:31.50 first off and credit to just who we are, we sign up when we say send me. And, and there's a lot of
02:34:31.50 --> 02:34:37.50 us that that answer that when you're on that, when you're living that life and you're on these
02:34:37.50 --> 02:34:43.02 deployments doing this cool stuff, you don't want to miss any of it. You're like, this is my slot.
02:34:43.02 --> 02:34:47.98 Nobody's coming in behind me and, you know, Sarah, you told me this. You're like, you know,
02:34:47.98 --> 02:34:52.38 in the truth of the matter, there's, there's a lot more seals right behind you. And so,
02:34:52.38 --> 02:34:57.18 commanders have this at their, at their discretion. They have this, this ability to kind of
02:34:57.18 --> 02:35:02.54 how do we, we can take a look back now, right? Remove all the politics about, you know, the
02:35:02.54 --> 02:35:07.10 wars are ending. Well, the wars aren't going to end for the tier one units ever, right? But, at
02:35:07.10 --> 02:35:14.62 the same time, we have an operational, we're not cool. There's less going on. There's less work.
02:35:14.62 --> 02:35:19.58 And we have this ability to kind of reset a little bit the way that we're, the way that we're approaching
02:35:19.58 --> 02:35:26.38 this. Yeah. Yeah. Well, this kind of conversation right here is a thing that can hopefully
02:35:26.38 --> 02:35:32.06 move this in the right direction. And I know that's the main reason that you're sitting here today
02:35:32.06 --> 02:35:39.58 is to try and move this in the right direction. And, and you're actually, when let's talk about
02:35:39.58 --> 02:35:44.86 how you're doing that, let's talk about, you know, the actual charities and stuff that you guys
02:35:44.86 --> 02:35:50.46 are doing to try and ways or what raise awareness. Yeah. So, the one thing Jason and I are
02:35:50.46 --> 02:35:57.26 partnered on is the workout and honor of my husband. We refer to it as Chad 1,000 X. Again,
02:35:57.26 --> 02:36:03.42 I spoke about this at his funeral. As he prepped it, he climbed that mountain. He did it by doing
02:36:03.42 --> 02:36:10.86 step-ups on a box and he did it on a 20-inch box with a 45-pound pack working up to a thousand
02:36:10.86 --> 02:36:15.26 over a period of time. And then once he got there, then he would just like pump out a thousand every
02:36:15.26 --> 02:36:23.42 couple days. Chad was super disciplined. He was incredibly focused and every goal that he had. And
02:36:23.42 --> 02:36:31.98 that's definitely something that I'm trying to have live within me. This workout I talked about
02:36:31.98 --> 02:36:38.70 it as funeral and so more or less organically kind of just became a thing. Right? Dave was there.
02:36:38.70 --> 02:36:43.50 CrossFit friends were there. Dave Castro was there. Yeah. And they just did it on their own
02:36:44.22 --> 02:36:49.10 just because they thought, oh, challenge, right? That's cool. A thousand step-ups, 45, you know, man stuff.
02:36:49.10 --> 02:36:56.94 Let's do it. And then fast forward. I'll stop you there. I won't speak for Dave, but I will say,
02:36:58.22 --> 02:37:04.14 Dave knew Chad. They served, they served together. And he doesn't know how to process that.
02:37:04.14 --> 02:37:07.34 You know? I mean, he doesn't know how to process the loss of a friend,
02:37:07.34 --> 02:37:13.90 especially to suicide. And so, you know, he's trying to do, it is amazing how many people want to
02:37:13.90 --> 02:37:21.26 help. How many people this is affected? I mean, Chad's life ripple effects huge, but everybody has this,
02:37:22.46 --> 02:37:28.54 there's some, this, this epidemic has touched so many people and nobody knows how to deal with it.
02:37:29.26 --> 02:37:34.94 Nobody knows how. I mean, my supposed to do 22 pushups and from my, you know, phone and and publish it on
02:37:34.94 --> 02:37:41.98 social media. I mean, is that helping? 22 is not the number. Right. That's not even an accurate number.
02:37:41.98 --> 02:37:48.94 It's 17 now, which is, which is better. You know, it's just so many people want to want to help.
02:37:48.94 --> 02:37:56.38 So I think, you know, Dave, for his part, I mean, I know he, he wanted to honor Chad and, you know,
02:37:56.38 --> 02:38:05.42 I think he wanted other people to honor Chad as well. And that's, yeah. So, so we established Chad
02:38:05.42 --> 02:38:14.46 1,000 X into an annual fundraiser. And there, there are many spouses like myself, Goldstar
02:38:14.46 --> 02:38:18.06 spouses, and they've gone on and there's golf tournaments and there's five keys and there's the
02:38:18.06 --> 02:38:24.54 like and they raise money for different organizations. This workout specifically, we want
02:38:24.54 --> 02:38:33.10 around veterans day because while it's Chad's face and I have kind of stepped into the role of
02:38:33.10 --> 02:38:41.82 sharing his story for me, it has less to do with with Chad Wilkinson and more to do about the
02:38:41.82 --> 02:38:48.94 struggle that our veterans currently have. And so why not really focus this around veterans day
02:38:48.94 --> 02:38:53.98 when that's what we're doing, honoring those serving and create a platform for them to talk to
02:38:53.98 --> 02:39:00.54 one another. We did this last year and it was kind of a late rollout and we're like, let's just
02:39:00.54 --> 02:39:07.74 like do this and see what happens and very we really had no expectation and I can't even express how
02:39:08.14 --> 02:39:15.98 humbled we were by the response and I mean it, it went global and went around the world. People
02:39:15.98 --> 02:39:25.02 people did this workout. I think the beauty of it is anybody can do this workout because a step
02:39:25.02 --> 02:39:31.90 up is not technical, we're not snatching, there's no muscle ups that you know anybody can do a step
02:39:31.90 --> 02:39:38.38 up and then obviously we scale it and you know you have this huge fitness background, you're
02:39:38.38 --> 02:39:44.46 well aware not everyone has to do the 20 inch box not everybody has to do that weight but being able
02:39:44.46 --> 02:39:54.14 to go do a workout and honor of someone in our military that that generally brings people together
02:39:54.14 --> 02:40:01.50 anyway because they want to kind of pay their humble respects but the potential that it could bring
02:40:02.06 --> 02:40:08.14 for people to have a conversation whether it's you're doing the step ups and maybe you start to
02:40:08.14 --> 02:40:13.50 realize in that hour time frame where your brain does go what do you think about you know
02:40:14.30 --> 02:40:20.46 your struggle the person you're doing it for the friend you lost do you do it with a friend
02:40:20.46 --> 02:40:25.26 and you guys can talk to each other well I think Jason and I have confirmed that once you get
02:40:25.26 --> 02:40:32.94 to probably about 500 you don't really talk anymore but the idea of doing it with a friend
02:40:32.94 --> 02:40:40.22 the symbolism there is to me everybody needs somebody. Have you put together technical
02:40:40.22 --> 02:40:47.66 question here have you put together like a ramp up program for people to do you know two months out
02:40:47.66 --> 02:40:53.90 do a hundred and then whatever break it down like you know those marathon programming things
02:40:53.90 --> 02:41:00.78 where yeah there's working the program yeah yeah and so you know part of the the bigger
02:41:00.78 --> 02:41:08.70 message here is you know I've never met the guy that I served with ever who said man I'm really looking
02:41:08.70 --> 02:41:12.54 forward to going to that shrinks office with the waterfall in the background and it's really quiet
02:41:12.54 --> 02:41:17.82 and let's go talk about feelings but I've never met that I've never met that person right especially
02:41:17.82 --> 02:41:25.10 from our community well have you heard a night go Chad went okay do you want to know how I feel about
02:41:25.10 --> 02:41:31.82 it sure I mean I've I've talked to a lot of guys I went to it that thought it was awesome
02:41:32.62 --> 02:41:38.70 and I don't know when Chad went December 2016 and we went to years he was dead if I found seven
02:41:38.70 --> 02:41:44.94 TBIs on his brain and they laughed what do you mean that wasn't very many one of the guys we were
02:41:44.94 --> 02:41:49.02 with have 42 he made a joke he said yeah I got to walk around with Vupal helmet because I can't
02:41:49.02 --> 02:41:53.58 risk falling over the guy you know I mean they can joke among each other but it's just like
02:41:53.58 --> 02:41:59.18 seven TBIs so that wasn't very many but you know what you can't find on all those screens
02:41:59.18 --> 02:42:10.22 CTE or interface astroglovescarring so you know I am of I am an advocate of whatever you find
02:42:10.22 --> 02:42:24.14 works if that works for you do it 100% I believe it feel it live it but I am not convinced by any
02:42:24.14 --> 02:42:34.46 military centered organization that they're really doing any sort of good yet and I don't know if
02:42:34.46 --> 02:42:42.14 they just want to talk about it and not be about it but less than two years later Chad was dead
02:42:42.14 --> 02:42:46.70 and you know you do all the things I mean there there is a lot of assessment that happens at that
02:42:46.70 --> 02:42:55.66 place and could be potentially good it told me almost all the things I already knew about him as a spouse
02:42:57.18 --> 02:43:04.46 I are you know they did personality tests and different stress tests and I mean yes I don't know
02:43:04.46 --> 02:43:12.06 the scientific sleep lab study but I could tell you his sleep is shit they did a test where they are
02:43:12.06 --> 02:43:17.50 trying to realize are you the guy that's gonna I'm trying to figure the best way they said this
02:43:17.50 --> 02:43:22.30 basically are you the guy that's gonna see a problem and respond right away like rapid fire like
02:43:22.30 --> 02:43:27.34 bull in a china shop are you the guy that's gonna like take a minute assess it and you're not going
02:43:27.34 --> 02:43:31.90 to be very fast but it's gonna be methodical and it's gonna be perfect well that's Chad if you would have
02:43:31.90 --> 02:43:38.70 ever watched him pack a car for a family trip that's Chad so all the things that they did there you know
02:43:38.70 --> 02:43:46.22 I don't feel like it gave me any more insight than I already had and I'm not so sure that's the
02:43:46.22 --> 02:43:52.54 case for Chad I mean and they do art therapy and they do dog therapy and they do music therapy
02:43:53.34 --> 02:43:59.42 and I mean even them making him walk a dog he finally said to him hey man I'll do whatever you want
02:43:59.42 --> 02:44:03.98 me to do but I'm not walking this damn dog he's probably one of the few team guys that like he
02:44:03.98 --> 02:44:11.26 didn't like dogs so yeah if it works for people and they got something out of it great but the
02:44:11.26 --> 02:44:15.50 way I see it is it's a way for the guys to go fat in their medical records so they can punch the
02:44:15.50 --> 02:44:21.10 ticket on where their medical disability lies which to be totally frank as a spouse every single
02:44:21.10 --> 02:44:28.14 one of those dudes should be a hundred percent disabled yeah no I I never went to it it wasn't I don't
02:44:28.14 --> 02:44:33.82 think it was it was in existence maybe but I never went to it but I do know a lot of guys that went
02:44:33.82 --> 02:44:37.90 to it that got a lot out of it and part of what they got out of it yeah they're looking at
02:44:37.90 --> 02:44:42.86 their medical record but you know they're I mean just the the decompression aspect of it
02:44:42.86 --> 02:44:49.66 meaning for 30 days like you're just gonna eat nice food and like not do anything not
02:44:49.66 --> 02:44:54.94 blown anything up or whatever there was and and guys felt I definitely know some guys that got
02:44:54.94 --> 02:45:02.22 a lot out of going to it clearly there's some shortfalls especially if they find issues and
02:45:02.22 --> 02:45:06.14 they're like oh yeah this is no factor that seems kind of crazy but yeah you mentioned that
02:45:06.14 --> 02:45:12.70 CTE thing because they can't they can't CTE follow your alive right it's post mortum so
02:45:12.70 --> 02:45:19.58 same thing interface out of school of scarring right now there is no test for it so to some degree
02:45:19.58 --> 02:45:24.70 those guys out there that has served multiple deployments and know you have some TBI's
02:45:24.70 --> 02:45:33.26 you might want to almost assume that that could be in there what what I think could be a great
02:45:33.26 --> 02:45:38.62 way and an extension of service for some of our military as this cakeo form we fill out
02:45:38.62 --> 02:45:48.14 before the guys deploy and for listeners it's it's it's it's it's it's a form we fill out
02:45:48.14 --> 02:45:53.10 that basically says what's gonna happen should your husband get killed or or wife your spouse
02:45:53.10 --> 02:45:57.66 gets killed and everything from who's gonna show a pet your door are they gonna weather
02:45:57.66 --> 02:46:02.22 uniform is it military honors are they buried are they cremated who's gonna take your kids all
02:46:02.22 --> 02:46:09.02 all those you know pretty important questions it's kind of sad that when you fill it out so many
02:46:09.02 --> 02:46:14.14 times it's commonplace I remember the first time I filled it out we mold over these questions
02:46:14.14 --> 02:46:19.42 for so long and and by the end of the deployments I mean I'm like making dinner and I'm like oh yeah
02:46:19.42 --> 02:46:23.50 that's fine yep that's fine wait change that because she moved and she's not gonna be able to get
02:46:23.50 --> 02:46:30.46 here in time so make it this person I mean that's how it is but and there's there is some there is
02:46:31.02 --> 02:46:35.58 gonna be some limitations and I don't know what they are but we were able to donate Chad's brain
02:46:35.58 --> 02:46:42.62 because he he was state side and you have to do it probably within 48 to 72 hours I'm not quite
02:46:42.62 --> 02:46:47.58 sure with the time frame is and his brain was studied and that's how we were able to determine
02:46:47.58 --> 02:46:53.26 that he did have that and I don't know if it would be applicable if you're overseas because of
02:46:53.26 --> 02:46:59.58 travel time etc but if you were to add that on the cakeo form that if you were killed you would
02:46:59.58 --> 02:47:08.70 like your brain donated this is in no way to encourage anybody to take their life by any means
02:47:08.70 --> 02:47:15.42 but either way if you're a team guy and and you get in a car accident and you die fill in the
02:47:15.42 --> 02:47:21.74 blank if you could also put on there or at least have a conversation with your person that you
02:47:21.74 --> 02:47:31.58 also want your brain donated that would be a great extension of service I think that's a straightforward
02:47:31.58 --> 02:47:37.50 ask I mean yeah the straightforward ask brain study is kind of a big it's a big topic in
02:47:37.50 --> 02:47:42.94 those circles right now there there's so many elements that go into this but you know there's
02:47:42.94 --> 02:47:49.82 the two places where the brain's really being studied right now are China and Japan and Europe
02:47:49.82 --> 02:47:54.54 you know they're just protests on chimpanzees excuse me and so you know because they're the closest
02:47:54.54 --> 02:48:01.26 to the the best way to study the brain is while it's working you know you can't make sense right
02:48:01.26 --> 02:48:08.94 and so you know we have issues doing that here with chimpanzees you know they're they're
02:48:08.94 --> 02:48:15.74 chasing off the European equivalent of pedas chasing off you know scientists from Europe they're
02:48:15.74 --> 02:48:20.78 they're just setting up shop in China and so like yeah we're gonna we're gonna graph this brain you know
02:48:20.78 --> 02:48:28.22 and so there's a lot of there's a lot of challenges that we will we will face what what we do
02:48:28.22 --> 02:48:35.10 know is that mass veteran suicide is not a thing guys don't all get together and kill themselves at
02:48:35.10 --> 02:48:42.30 the same time what we need we need to create communities with with bonds of people that were
02:48:42.30 --> 02:48:49.74 able to take some of the lessons that that Sarah's bravely sharing with us and and so many behind
02:48:49.74 --> 02:48:54.46 or behind and around her are sharing about their journey what they've seen we need to strengthen
02:48:54.46 --> 02:48:59.18 the community so that we're able to kind of watch after each other because the military has a
02:48:59.18 --> 02:49:08.06 stronger social fabric than pretty much anywhere and in sort of normal you know middle America or
02:49:08.06 --> 02:49:13.66 anywhere America right and still you're your 1.5 there's a lot of different statistics but you're
02:49:13.66 --> 02:49:20.30 1.5 times more likely to take your life if you're in the military than if you're not and it's just you
02:49:20.30 --> 02:49:26.86 know how is this happening like how is this okay well it's not okay and so what we're trying to
02:49:26.86 --> 02:49:31.58 do and what we are doing is bringing people together in the real world not in a shrinks office
02:49:31.58 --> 02:49:36.22 with the waterfall you know that you don't want to be there and it's like hey you know physical health
02:49:36.78 --> 02:49:41.18 mental health somehow those are definitely we don't have to study chimpanzees to know that those
02:49:41.18 --> 02:49:48.54 are definitely tied together and obviously Chad did not suffer from physical you know like he could
02:49:48.54 --> 02:49:52.78 do a thousand step ups just fine and climb mountains and stuff but you know all these things you know
02:49:52.78 --> 02:49:59.02 you're not sleeping well great work out you know you talk about this all the time jocco right you know
02:49:59.74 --> 02:50:04.86 and and so bring people together yes think about this and so it was really telling when we did
02:50:04.86 --> 02:50:09.98 this in Virginia Beach and and guys it chatted served with showed up you know quietly kind of
02:50:09.98 --> 02:50:17.18 did the work you know they showed up in the big f9 50s you know it's like just awesome this is
02:50:17.18 --> 02:50:24.22 America god bless us right and you know they showed up and if this was a group counseling session
02:50:24.22 --> 02:50:29.58 to talk about you know the mandatory briefs away nobody's showing up for that stuff but you show
02:50:29.58 --> 02:50:35.10 up and you do the work in honor of you know to honor Chad's life and to think about veteran
02:50:35.10 --> 02:50:40.62 suicide prevention to think about this unbreakable guy right I mean go ask anybody in the navy
02:50:40.62 --> 02:50:47.74 that go on to be a seal do you want Chad's career they're like yes that's I want that to be me and
02:50:47.74 --> 02:50:53.58 you got guys showing up and you know there there's some community around it you know everyone's
02:50:53.58 --> 02:51:00.70 then bend in seris ear that's you know because it's issue is so close to so close to so many people
02:51:00.70 --> 02:51:06.46 in the community and but you're just strengthening bonds right you bring people together in the
02:51:06.46 --> 02:51:10.78 real world this is very counter culture and we're very cool with that you know and a world where
02:51:10.78 --> 02:51:15.10 kids are grown up text messaging each other to instead of talking instead of sitting in the
02:51:15.10 --> 02:51:22.78 captain's gap like like we are right now right and we need this where social animals and we need to
02:51:22.78 --> 02:51:29.34 be a part of something bigger than ourselves and so that's that's what we're about and physical health
02:51:29.34 --> 02:51:36.30 and mental health and raising awareness and it's it can't just be you know trying to beat it into
02:51:36.30 --> 02:51:40.78 people right like oh I'm a hammer I see a nail let me just tell let me tell you about veteran
02:51:40.78 --> 02:51:47.10 suicide prevention people just tune that out but when you've got a story as got a story like
02:51:47.10 --> 02:51:52.54 chas and you got some like Sarah that's that's able and willing to tell it I mean this is hard
02:51:52.54 --> 02:51:57.50 she's got to she's got to saddle up every time every time for this and she's doing it because she
02:51:57.50 --> 02:52:02.70 wants to change the number and she wants other people to not go through what she's had to go through
02:52:03.26 --> 02:52:10.54 and there's there's a lot of bravery that goes into that and you know and so that's I'm I'm proud
02:52:10.54 --> 02:52:16.86 that we get to I mean I work for her in this go rock works for her and you know we don't do anything
02:52:16.86 --> 02:52:22.78 that that she's not on board with in terms of Chad's story or just the way that we're running the
02:52:22.78 --> 02:52:29.82 event around and you know we just have this is just a unique opportunity in the kind of veteran
02:52:29.82 --> 02:52:36.06 suicide prevention space that that nobody wants to be too close to but unfortunately you know some
02:52:36.06 --> 02:52:42.06 of us are and and so it's a real honor this is this is the thing I'm most proud of that have been
02:52:42.06 --> 02:52:51.42 a part of because it is it's it's it's it's changing lives helping people and bringing them together
02:52:51.42 --> 02:52:56.38 and raising awareness for something that is is really important to me because I know I know you've
02:52:56.38 --> 02:53:01.74 lost people in your circle I'm sure people in my circle there's you know you have to
02:53:01.74 --> 02:53:08.14 Sarah sit right there I mean this is this is her life and so it just this is this matters this
02:53:08.14 --> 02:53:15.74 matters hugely to us well I'm on board like what do people need to do when they're on board what
02:53:15.74 --> 02:53:23.26 are we doing what's what's our deal well we we want people to take to the workout and that
02:53:23.26 --> 02:53:28.94 might look different for a lot of people you can go to your local gyms jump on it do it in your
02:53:28.94 --> 02:53:34.62 garage find a buddy we're hosting larger scale what we call live events this year and we're doing
02:53:34.62 --> 02:53:40.54 those in some we'll call like flagship cities one of them's here in San Diego so we're hoping maybe
02:53:40.54 --> 02:53:47.42 you might come and show up right home no number six San Diego it'll be across fit humanity so
02:53:47.42 --> 02:53:52.46 not too far from here I passed it actually on the way we're doing it November 3rd well let me
02:53:52.46 --> 02:53:58.14 back up November 5th we're gonna be doing it in four piers florida at the UDTC old museum so
02:53:58.14 --> 02:54:02.78 it's their stumpmaster we can I'll be speaking and doing some other things down there so

02:54:08.38 --> 02:54:15.02 it is it is it is really really cool um so that's November 5th November 6th we're in San Diego
02:54:15.02 --> 02:54:23.42 November 11th is gonna be New York City November 13th is gonna be Virginia Beach my hometown and
02:54:23.42 --> 02:54:29.02 jacks jacks is actually November 6th now oh is it we've moved a little bit earlier yes we're hosting so
02:54:29.02 --> 02:54:34.78 you know call it a big giant monster start start getting your your train on you got a thousand
02:54:34.78 --> 02:54:43.50 box steps with a forty five pound rock bro that's a get some evolution that's a get some evolution for
02:54:43.50 --> 02:54:48.22 sure you know he used to do that I don't know if you know this but he used to do it in the garage
02:54:48.22 --> 02:54:53.74 I've video of this him doing step ups and he would do it and you know the garage and just shorts
02:54:53.74 --> 02:54:59.34 and his backpack he cut all the tags out of his gear right ounces equal pound Sarah ounces equal
02:54:59.34 --> 02:55:04.70 pound so he knew he was carrying but he used a projector and he projected a concoge on the back
02:55:04.70 --> 02:55:12.14 of our garage door so when I talk about focus that's how focused he was and that's that's how
02:55:12.14 --> 02:55:17.66 focused I am with this so and then and then what what we're raising money is that what we're doing
02:55:17.66 --> 02:55:22.62 we are raising money okay so um this this came about through a partnership that go rock at
02:55:22.62 --> 02:55:27.58 had with the Navy seal foundation also you know one of your brothers Chris Irwin who was Sarah was
02:55:27.58 --> 02:55:32.62 his level one cross fit instructor in Virginia Beach way back when I mean you know everyone is so
02:55:32.62 --> 02:55:39.42 close to to everyone and he had he had called me and said hey you know because did you
02:55:39.42 --> 02:55:44.94 look teach you any of these ones out here on the west coast I taught some in Delmar
02:55:44.94 --> 02:55:50.38 yeah I think I probably went to two or three of those over the years in that time frame too yeah
02:55:50.38 --> 02:55:55.34 yeah yeah I'm really surprised yeah I was like I was the massive deadlift now
02:55:55.34 --> 02:55:58.14 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
02:55:58.14 --> 02:56:03.58 no you would not remember me from my physical attributes at a cross fits ever not yeah so we're
02:56:03.58 --> 02:56:09.02 raising money so we're raising money and you know this this came about through that partnership and
02:56:09.02 --> 02:56:14.70 and you know Chris had called me up and he was like you know nobody knows how to deal with this
02:56:14.70 --> 02:56:22.06 man everyone wants to deal with it and nobody knows how to deal with it and you know so you get
02:56:22.06 --> 02:56:26.70 guys that are in positions that you're at the seal foundation and go rock whatever right it's like
02:56:26.70 --> 02:56:30.70 we we want to deal with this we still didn't know how to deal with it and it's like well I think I got
02:56:31.34 --> 02:56:37.18 I think this Chad workout is the way that we can deal with this he goes but I got to call Sarah
02:56:37.18 --> 02:56:41.90 because obviously you know you don't do anything without the family and the family's not on board
02:56:41.90 --> 02:56:47.58 especially the this spouse I mean spouse is the that that's the that's the that's the deal and you know
02:56:47.58 --> 02:56:52.94 she had to think about it you know said no and then thought about it we ended up chatting with me and
02:56:52.94 --> 02:56:59.02 Emily and and Chris and Sarah and a call amount you know it's Florida we have you know it's hot
02:56:59.02 --> 02:57:03.50 about side my kids are inside pure chaos we're chatting on zoom or whatever it was in the middle
02:57:03.50 --> 02:57:08.86 of the pandemic and she's finally like okay let's do this and I'm like I kind of said okay well you
02:57:08.86 --> 02:57:13.98 know if you change your mind she's like no I've made up my mind we're doing this right and so to
02:57:13.98 --> 02:57:19.90 to throw her another like cross if there's a lot of hard workouts in CrossFit right a lot of you can
02:57:19.90 --> 02:57:26.46 look at you know you can do them harder you can scale them to whatever the the hardest the hardest
02:57:26.46 --> 02:57:32.78 workout in the history of CrossFit that's ever been done was how she did Chad the first time
02:57:33.42 --> 02:57:38.94 she went into into their garage and she put on Chad's Rucksack by herself and did Chad
02:57:38.94 --> 02:57:44.94 so think about that when you're feeling sorry for yourself out there you know because it's a hard
02:57:44.94 --> 02:57:50.14 workout and it is right and and that's what it's supposed to be everyone's selling easy that that's
02:57:50.14 --> 02:57:55.74 you don't think about anything when when life's easy except the next easy thing you're going to get right
02:57:55.74 --> 02:58:01.58 you're you're meant to dig deep you're meant to think about this and and that's that's the goal and so
02:58:01.58 --> 02:58:09.18 raising money half of it's going to the seal foundation Sarah has a nonprofit called the step up project and
02:58:09.18 --> 02:58:14.22 and that's you know it's it's veteran mental health stuff it's all going to support that
02:58:15.66 --> 02:58:22.30 yeah well that's outstanding and you know I have to throw this out there because like earlier you
02:58:22.30 --> 02:58:27.10 we were talking in the middle of whatever some high emotion moments and you said something about the
02:58:27.10 --> 02:58:34.46 the the families right and I just I I thought about it but then you know we kept talking but
02:58:34.46 --> 02:58:40.78 just the fact that the military families out there and what they put up with and what they go through
02:58:40.78 --> 02:58:46.46 and usually I mean in my mind I have to worry more than the people that are than the military themselves
02:58:47.50 --> 02:58:53.66 so on on top of all this just you know the families that are out there that the the
02:58:53.66 --> 02:59:03.02 the spouses you know come on down too because like it just get to know other people that are
02:59:03.02 --> 02:59:09.10 living that life you know I know that might might my wife you know she wasn't around we didn't have
02:59:09.10 --> 02:59:13.66 any family around like we didn't have any family we lived in California we lived in Virginia Beach I was
02:59:13.66 --> 02:59:18.06 gone almost the entire time she didn't know anyone she ended up doing what you did which is going to
02:59:18.06 --> 02:59:24.78 live with my parents for a while but yeah just families right military families too come and get it
02:59:24.78 --> 02:59:30.30 that's what I'm thinking family friendly kid friendly we don't discriminate come on down all of them
02:59:30.30 --> 02:59:34.86 it was it was so awesome in Virginia Beach it was such a great vibe you know we were there at the
02:59:35.58 --> 02:59:41.98 crack a dawn right set and box is up and then you know it's like all of a sudden people start
02:59:41.98 --> 02:59:46.38 to show up in waves because you need a box right so there's waves of people getting on the box
02:59:46.38 --> 02:59:52.30 and people I mean we were there my flight was late that that afternoon and you guys are still you know
02:59:52.30 --> 02:59:57.74 there was still a big crew there just like social it was social and so it's not a depressing
02:59:58.86 --> 03:00:03.42 you know it's not it's not like you just people can't live inside that space forever right
03:00:03.42 --> 03:00:07.58 you have you you have your your difficult moments and you think about it and it's in it's hard
03:00:08.22 --> 03:00:15.18 but you know anybody anybody that that served the way that Chad served like the guys I served with
03:00:15.18 --> 03:00:21.34 you don't want people to walk around depressed after you're gone you want them you you don't want that
03:00:22.14 --> 03:00:29.66 I also think like a lot of I just think the more we do talk about it the the easier it is for someone
03:00:29.66 --> 03:00:38.78 else to say me too and so it's hard to come out and talk about this all the time and I've had
03:00:38.78 --> 03:00:45.82 this week has been a very busy week for me so I'm pretty it's been hard but I have to believe that
03:00:45.82 --> 03:00:52.70 the more I talk about it and share Chad's story or share the story of of other friends that have
03:00:52.70 --> 03:00:58.14 passed took their lives that other people will start to speak up at this virginian beach event I had
03:00:58.14 --> 03:01:05.02 three people separately pull me aside and confide in me struggles that they had I've had people
03:01:05.02 --> 03:01:10.38 reach out to me through social media like long messages I don't care I don't care how long it is I don't
03:01:10.38 --> 03:01:18.46 care how short it is and I respond back and I I think that it's slow and I think it's a trickle
03:01:18.46 --> 03:01:26.70 but the potential for this workout done around veterans day so we can talk about people's stories
03:01:26.70 --> 03:01:32.94 so that it might encourage someone else to say me too maybe all if all they need to hear is that
03:01:32.94 --> 03:01:37.10 they're not alone and that someone else feels that too maybe that's what someone needs and that's great
03:01:37.10 --> 03:01:47.18 yeah that's uh when you know what's happening it makes me so much easier and I talk about this
03:01:47.18 --> 03:01:51.34 like you get a new guy like Jason you get a new guy that looks really nervous before their first
03:01:51.34 --> 03:01:56.14 operation and if you go hey bro here's what's going on your nervous it's cool you're a little
03:01:56.14 --> 03:02:00.62 crazy your stomach's a little messed up yeah because they're they're scared they're nervous and if
03:02:00.62 --> 03:02:04.70 you go yeah that's normal it's just no big deal you're gonna feel that that way a little bit before
03:02:04.70 --> 03:02:08.54 you go on an ops uh no big deal don't worry about it that's your body preparing to go into combat it's
03:02:08.54 --> 03:02:13.50 all good and you can see like relief on their face that's mentorship right there yeah yeah we need more
03:02:13.50 --> 03:02:21.66 of that yeah and this to me this this whole thing is like if you can tell someone oh yeah you you've
03:02:21.66 --> 03:02:27.74 breached 47 doors in your last three week trip which is not an extraordinary and I'm like that
03:02:27.74 --> 03:02:33.74 that's you know oh you you've got crashed in the room however many times you shot a coral goost off
03:02:34.54 --> 03:02:41.42 29 times you or you were the rate the RSO so you had you know two troops go through and shoot
03:02:41.42 --> 03:02:49.50 one per man and you rate you RSO all the fun that's whatever you know 80 freaking blast next to your
03:02:49.50 --> 03:02:54.62 head that you sat through and there's some things that are going on inside your brain here's what's
03:02:54.62 --> 03:03:00.30 going on here's what you need to watch out for here's how you can get ahead of it that kind of
03:03:00.30 --> 03:03:06.22 conversation about this stuff is the same thing that it impacts that young new guy that goes okay
03:03:06.22 --> 03:03:12.54 got it now I can grab it now I can get a hold of it and I can move forward it's awesome
03:03:15.58 --> 03:03:23.66 Chad 1000x dot com that's where we can go to find out about this stuff go rock your at go rock
03:03:23.66 --> 03:03:28.86 cross the board cross the board Jason if you want to talk to Jason at go rock and just go rock
03:03:28.86 --> 03:03:37.74 if I live in Idaho can I do go go rock yes what if I live in Nebraska so look here's the thing
03:03:37.74 --> 03:03:43.98 we have we have 500 official go rock clubs around the the country and and part of it is
03:03:44.70 --> 03:03:50.30 we we're activating all of them for this we really believe in this world of people getting together
03:03:50.30 --> 03:03:55.34 in the real world and this is not about you don't have to be of a veteran to do this you don't
03:03:55.34 --> 03:04:00.14 have to be anything except willing to show up right and you get so much out of that and got through
03:04:00.14 --> 03:04:06.62 a freaking thousand stuff up it just that fly out yeah it's an hour you know it's an hour yeah
03:04:06.62 --> 03:04:12.94 okay slow and steady slow and steady wins the race yeah I mean yeah and you want to train up
03:04:13.42 --> 03:04:18.62 yeah well that's maybe we need to release some kind of a preparatory workout so I want to
03:04:18.62 --> 03:04:25.34 wrap though people coming up you're worried about people coming at you after for for a
03:04:25.34 --> 03:04:31.34 wrappedo now come on I've imposed a wrappedo on a few people and it it doesn't feel good I feel
03:04:31.34 --> 03:04:37.82 comfortable you know I always feel like I don't do it anymore I kind of figured it out like it's just
03:04:38.62 --> 03:04:44.22 it's not I don't like doing that to people no no we it's same thing so this claimer is you need to
03:04:44.22 --> 03:04:49.90 train yourself up this is an hour it's it's step ups yeah you got it up up so the 45 found
03:04:49.90 --> 03:04:53.98 played on your back yeah scale it down if you're not right do we need to train what we need to
03:04:53.98 --> 03:04:59.02 train for yes that's what I'm saying so it's a buy-in for your your workout it's it's a cash out
03:04:59.02 --> 03:05:03.50 for your workouts whatever else you're doing just just integrate a box if you've got a cooler
03:05:03.50 --> 03:05:08.38 in your house use a cooler if there's you know like whatever the case may be you have steps
03:05:08.38 --> 03:05:18.30 yep get it uh Instagram you're on Instagram yes Sarah Wilkinson 7 number 7 yep
03:05:20.70 --> 03:05:27.26 Jason you got anything else did I miss anything I don't think so and do we miss anything
03:05:28.54 --> 03:05:34.70 oh well I guess just to bring just to make the point one more time and is that where we find the
03:05:34.70 --> 03:05:42.78 guys are very fragile I'm gonna say fragile is in their transition time so when people are
03:05:42.78 --> 03:05:47.66 separating from the military maybe they didn't hit retirement maybe they've done 10 years in
03:05:47.66 --> 03:05:54.62 their transitioning out or their at retirement and now they need to transition to civilian life that
03:05:54.62 --> 03:06:04.14 is a very for a seal I'm gonna say that's a very delicate time for them and I would encourage
03:06:04.14 --> 03:06:12.22 families peers to really be on the lookout for them during that time because as we've talked so
03:06:12.22 --> 03:06:20.38 much about the brain and PTSD there's also that loss of of tribe or at least they feel as though
03:06:20.38 --> 03:06:28.62 there is and what we see is sometimes that increases the likelihood of maybe someone not making a
03:06:28.62 --> 03:06:36.06 really good decision so I would just encourage people to just be of the best support for those people
03:06:36.06 --> 03:06:43.34 during that period of transition yeah interestingly that's when a that's when a seal platoon is
03:06:43.34 --> 03:06:50.06 most exposed when they're transitioning from the water to the land or the land to the water and there's
03:06:50.06 --> 03:06:55.90 not only a perceived loss of tribe like you're talking about but also that perceived loss of
03:06:55.90 --> 03:07:00.22 mission because what have I been doing my whole life and all of a sudden what am I gonna do now?
03:07:01.42 --> 03:07:06.94 Yeah when Chad when Chad was close to 20 years we were at the discussion of what we do you know my
03:07:06.94 --> 03:07:15.02 dad served 26 years his dad served somewhere about that I can't quite remember and you know the hard part
03:07:15.02 --> 03:07:22.30 is I I really kind of hope he would pick us I thought okay we've done 20 years like we've done 20
03:07:22.30 --> 03:07:33.10 years me Sarah Chad Kinsey Hudson we've done it boom pick us and he didn't and I again believe he
03:07:33.10 --> 03:07:44.06 had a warrior's heart and he was born to do this but I said to him well you know we talked about
03:07:44.06 --> 03:07:51.82 jobs and I just remember he looked at me and he said I don't have any skills that's what they think
03:07:51.82 --> 03:07:56.30 I mean he was dead serious and you're thinking what I mean I know that you're not gonna go work
03:07:56.30 --> 03:08:03.02 for someone and be hanging out in bushes and kicking down doors most likely but what the skills these
03:08:03.02 --> 03:08:10.78 guys do have I mean most of them are are very intelligent critical thinkers analytical
03:08:11.82 --> 03:08:16.22 problem solvers think outside of the box can make decisions quickly
03:08:16.22 --> 03:08:24.94 that is a lot of really great attributes that many organizations and civilian world would want and so
03:08:25.82 --> 03:08:31.82 again just to speak to I you know it's that loss of identity and it's like I've been shooting guns
03:08:31.82 --> 03:08:34.54 and busting down doors what what else do I do?
03:08:38.22 --> 03:08:45.10 one of my first put to chief said he there was a old Vietnam seal and he was a male man now
03:08:45.10 --> 03:08:50.14 and they would go over there and like drink beer or whatever it is house and he'd tell stories
03:08:50.14 --> 03:08:59.42 about nom nice and he had this picture on the wall and it was like a shop from behind like a picture
03:08:59.42 --> 03:09:06.14 of of a guy's back and the guy's the guy whose back you see is clearly a Vietnam seal with a floppy
03:09:06.14 --> 03:09:11.34 hat and a stoner and his web gear on and his jungle cammy top and his blue jeans and he
03:09:11.34 --> 03:09:17.82 standing in front of like a corporate desk and the corporate desk there's the boss guys looking
03:09:17.82 --> 03:09:22.22 at him in the caption underneath this I'm sorry sir we don't have any jobs for appointment here
03:09:24.46 --> 03:09:28.78 which is true but to your point and believe me I see this all the time I work with companies
03:09:28.78 --> 03:09:34.06 all over the country and all over the world actually and they absolutely need the individuals
03:09:34.06 --> 03:09:39.10 that have these kind of attributes that you're talking about and there is absolutely a new mission
03:09:39.10 --> 03:09:44.14 when you get done with the military to go out in the civilian world and have an impact make people's
03:09:44.14 --> 03:09:49.42 lives better and build great products and build great companies and and do great things and that is
03:09:49.42 --> 03:09:56.70 absolutely available and you are needed in the in the civilian world and that's the way it is
03:09:58.06 --> 03:10:05.34 we need them too all right like our country needs people with this kind of experience spread
03:10:05.34 --> 03:10:09.66 throughout our our country spread throughout our companies spread throughout our communities spread
03:10:09.66 --> 03:10:14.54 throughout our our neighborhoods and one of the things that makes San Diego such a great town is
03:10:14.54 --> 03:10:19.74 it's it's a military there's it's a military town you've got this just underpinnings of San Diego
03:10:19.74 --> 03:10:24.62 the foundation is strong it's the same where I live in Jacksonville beach I mean my my neighbor
03:10:24.62 --> 03:10:29.26 two doors down is a top gun instructor I mean these things are just normal around
03:10:29.26 --> 03:10:35.18 us and it's great they're just good people that are just you know this talk about you know the
03:10:35.18 --> 03:10:40.46 greatest generation coming back to America and just doing great stuff getting educated and working
03:10:40.46 --> 03:10:47.02 their asses off and building America into America and you know we need more of that and so we need
03:10:47.02 --> 03:10:53.58 we need the transition is it's to echo her point I mean it's just sucks I mean don't underestimate
03:10:53.58 --> 03:10:59.82 it under any circumstances it can happen to you it will happen to you it will be terrible and and
03:10:59.82 --> 03:11:04.62 just now that you know it's common brace for it a little bit take it easy on yourself build out
03:11:04.62 --> 03:11:10.94 some support structures around you you know stuff like that and we just this is going to
03:11:10.94 --> 03:11:17.26 require something that is not kind of normal this day and age it's going to require us to kind of
03:11:17.26 --> 03:11:25.26 work together you know like how to support transitioning folks better how to kind of build stronger
03:11:25.26 --> 03:11:30.86 communities in the real world how to like that's what we need we don't you don't need guys coming
03:11:30.86 --> 03:11:35.74 out and it's like hey you don't you need to do you need to be an influencer on Instagram right
03:11:35.74 --> 03:11:44.70 like no you know how about not that right and and so you know it's it's it's difficult it's difficult
03:11:44.70 --> 03:11:50.94 and and we have to keep having the conversation that that's why I respect you and then and I
03:11:50.94 --> 03:11:57.02 respect this long form podcast stuff that you do because it's it forces people you know it's not
03:11:57.02 --> 03:12:03.10 just soundbites it's like hey here's the story this is nothing's as simple as it looks on someone's
03:12:03.10 --> 03:12:09.98 feed and you know that that's kind of what real life is like and and I think that we we need more of
03:12:09.98 --> 03:12:19.58 that not less totally agree well speaking along form I've kept you in here for over three hours
03:12:20.54 --> 03:12:25.26 Jason thank you for what you're doing thanks for your service you know we covered that last time
03:12:26.14 --> 03:12:30.46 and thanks for what you're continuing to do build and go rock and forming communities out there
03:12:31.18 --> 03:12:35.82 real communities I can see this look in your eye when you when you start saying that and and I get it
03:12:35.82 --> 03:12:42.14 man and for me it's a lot through jiu jitsu but look that that's a real thing and getting people together
03:12:42.14 --> 03:12:50.30 to get together and sweat and work to positive thing man appreciate what you're doing and Sarah

03:12:57.42 --> 03:13:05.26 line and while your husband was gone and gone again and gone again and and being there and
03:13:05.26 --> 03:13:11.82 raising the family and building a business and doing all those things the all the military families
03:13:11.82 --> 03:13:21.98 that are listening right now for what you go through and and what they risk so thanks to you
03:13:21.98 --> 03:13:31.02 thanks to your kids as well for what they've gone through and of course Chad um thanks for your service bro
03:13:36.38 --> 03:13:47.82 we won't forget amen thank you and with that Sarah Wilkinson and Jason McCarthy have
03:13:47.82 --> 03:14:00.62 left the building and echo Charles we need to go a little bit old school I think on this one for
03:14:01.18 --> 03:14:10.46 the decompression right so if you've never listened this before the original purpose of
03:14:11.66 --> 03:14:16.86 when we would get done with the podcast echo Charles and I would just kind of start talking about
03:14:16.86 --> 03:14:24.46 stuff for a little while it was to decompress from a heavy subject as we started doing podcast
03:14:24.46 --> 03:14:29.66 I started hitting some heavy subjects along the way this we would originally just kind of start talking
03:14:29.66 --> 03:14:35.42 and I would just kind of let echo talk for a little bit while I did the decompression because I'm
03:14:35.42 --> 03:14:42.22 usually the one that's all wrapped up in whatever subject is we're talking about so certainly
03:14:42.22 --> 03:14:51.34 a in need of a little decompression after that one just a just a very tough subject and and
03:14:52.22 --> 03:14:59.10 that's why we're talking about it right we're talking about it as you know Sarah said something
03:14:59.10 --> 03:15:04.94 that she doesn't want anyone else to have to go through and that's why we talk about these things
03:15:04.94 --> 03:15:17.58 so for a little decompression I'll let you talk a little bit echo Charles we we want people to
03:15:17.58 --> 03:15:22.94 take care of themselves it's true so you you like it's weird because so that there's so many
03:15:22.94 --> 03:15:29.42 mysteries to the brain so and with your body like your physical your other parts of your body
03:15:29.42 --> 03:15:35.34 it's like less of a mystery right so like yeah you go in you know you're in a combat scenario you get
03:15:35.34 --> 03:15:41.42 shot in the abdomen then it's like okay it's gonna be pretty straightforward as far as hey can we save
03:15:41.42 --> 03:15:45.90 this guy can we not you know all the stuff and like he can bleed out he there's all these things and
03:15:45.90 --> 03:15:50.22 then there's these you know you can take specific actions and then hopefully we can save them all this
03:15:51.02 --> 03:15:55.02 you get shot on the leg or something while you're running or you blow out your knee or something
03:15:55.02 --> 03:15:59.98 it's like okay it's broken he can't run anymore it's like pretty straightforward but the brain
03:15:59.98 --> 03:16:03.42 gets damaged and one way or another it's kind of like there's no telling what's gonna happen
03:16:03.42 --> 03:16:09.82 a lot of the time you know and you don't know when either it's it is the brain is the mysterious
03:16:10.78 --> 03:16:15.58 part of the anatomy right now and nerves right and I don't really know how they work it's
03:16:15.58 --> 03:16:21.74 very hard to like repair them and and then yeah as we said you take that brain and rattle around
03:16:21.74 --> 03:16:28.14 inside of a inside of your skull over and over again we don't know what it's gonna do but we know
03:16:28.14 --> 03:16:34.22 it's not good we know that yeah and then you have to make it kind of in a way we're okay remember
03:16:34.22 --> 03:16:40.22 cursed the NS yes right so she she got jammed out she got injured and she still had her leg you know
03:16:40.22 --> 03:16:44.78 she's she's doing this thing and then but she's constantly being checked in upon you know checked on
03:16:44.78 --> 03:16:49.42 and be like okay and then over time they were like hey okay we're at a point where we got to
03:16:49.42 --> 03:16:53.50 make this very specific decision and we know what could and you know all the stuff and it was
03:16:53.50 --> 03:16:56.86 pretty it was pretty clear and then you make the decision but that's an example of
03:16:57.50 --> 03:17:02.70 incurring an injury and then it's still having lasting effects last and effects last and until you
03:17:02.70 --> 03:17:10.06 got it you know either risk actually dying or risk a huge or bigger injuries or just say
03:17:10.06 --> 03:17:16.78 top it off or amputated and you know remember her talking about she knows she because she could still
03:17:16.78 --> 03:17:25.34 walk yeah yeah and she was taking her last walk on the beach in the sand yeah exactly right
03:17:25.34 --> 03:17:31.98 but a perfect example of like you can incur the injury it's still handle still you know go about
03:17:31.98 --> 03:17:35.42 your business sure you jumped up here and they're here and they're there and then but the injury
03:17:35.42 --> 03:17:40.22 is still progressing yeah it's getting you know getting worse yeah and then you got and mean
03:17:40.22 --> 03:17:43.74 well but the thing is again for your your other parts of your body it's kind of like there's kind
03:17:43.74 --> 03:17:48.38 of a protocol you can check in and be like okay for the brain so mysterious it's like we
03:17:48.38 --> 03:17:53.50 can try and we are kind of trying to do that but it's so mysterious that it's not as cut in dry
03:17:53.50 --> 03:17:59.10 like that and it's the same exact thing he incurred all these injuries at some point and that
03:17:59.10 --> 03:18:04.46 thing just keeps lasting and lasting getting worse and worse and worse you know until it gets you
03:18:06.06 --> 03:18:10.14 it's hard to like get a grip on exactly what's happening
03:18:10.14 --> 03:18:16.14 you just crazy though it's the unknown frontier of the human body probably the most unknown
03:18:16.54 --> 03:18:22.06 frontier of the human body yeah the nerves and the brain and there's so many illusions too even
03:18:22.06 --> 03:18:28.38 like with yourself where you can be like I just do this in this situation or that situation or I
03:18:28.38 --> 03:18:32.78 would never choose to do that but you get in a certain like situation you do some stuff that's
03:18:32.78 --> 03:18:38.78 real unexplainable or only explainable later even though you thought from before hand you see
03:18:38.78 --> 03:18:43.18 you were you were so convinced of something and then afterwards you're like oh she also
03:18:43.18 --> 03:18:47.74 surprised on what you did you know kind of thing so it's like so there's this big illusion like
03:18:47.74 --> 03:18:52.22 it's like oh yeah you could just make the decision not to or whatever but it's like back to
03:18:52.22 --> 03:19:01.82 the work like that lots of factors come into play well we do want people to like I said
03:19:01.82 --> 03:19:06.62 want people to take care of themselves yeah and the ones around them and around them but we got
03:19:06.62 --> 03:19:12.46 a kind of like the analogy goes with the the plane and the oxygen got to put the oxygen on your
03:19:12.46 --> 03:19:16.38 own face before you put it on your kids it's true so so you got to do a little something to
03:19:16.38 --> 03:19:21.02 kind of keep yourself in the game Sarah mentioned something where he said oh I don't have any
03:19:21.02 --> 03:19:24.70 skills right and he's talking about getting a job or something like this and I was thinking yeah
03:19:24.70 --> 03:19:30.22 you know I can see why someone might think that off like for at first but the fact is you have
03:19:30.22 --> 03:19:36.22 a lot of skills because one of the main skills is straight up capability in all these different ways
03:19:36.22 --> 03:19:41.18 where you know you can learn this specific thing or learn that specific trade and all this other
03:19:41.18 --> 03:19:45.18 stuff but if someone who's just a more capable person across the board that guy's going to excel in
03:19:45.18 --> 03:19:52.06 those skills for sure so in my opinion that's an important thing to be capable and to stay capable
03:19:52.06 --> 03:20:01.82 sure that's on this path of capability hopefully it takes a minute some heavies it happens that's
03:20:01.82 --> 03:20:06.78 kind of like you mentioned you just do and you just if you're going hard are you not going to get
03:20:06.78 --> 03:20:13.02 ding the no you are going to get that's kind of the nature of going hard same saying no just like
03:20:13.02 --> 03:20:17.10 and work out just like with anything else but don't worry supplementation will help us all
03:20:18.30 --> 03:20:24.94 through those dings dance so anyway chocolate supplements a lot more you've seen chocolate supplements
03:20:25.66 --> 03:20:30.46 so first thing we're going to be compressing you know you made me chuckle a little bit we're trying
03:20:30.46 --> 03:20:36.14 over here decompression okay yeah so chocolate has a new era of energy drinks straight up healthy for
03:20:36.14 --> 03:20:41.50 you I know we don't need quite health and energy drinks in the same thing didn't you still no we do
03:20:41.50 --> 03:20:49.98 know we do now new era discipline go any different flavors best flavors mango kind of by far
03:20:49.98 --> 03:20:56.70 to pass and that's like an activity and that's saying a lot because the orange is freaking good
03:20:56.70 --> 03:21:01.58 you know on the sour out like these are like good flavor they taste good but like mango is just
03:21:01.58 --> 03:21:07.90 so much better it's like crazy it's saying a lot you're saying yeah the good thing is that these
03:21:07.90 --> 03:21:13.66 drinks they taste different you you got a some people might not like mango probably a small number
03:21:13.66 --> 03:21:19.98 people some people might not like orange some people might not like sour apple sniper some people
03:21:19.98 --> 03:21:27.98 might not like jockel Palmer some people might not like whatever so the recommendation is try
03:21:27.98 --> 03:21:36.14 on try one see what you like yeah let me know but let echo Charles know if his signature flavor is
03:21:36.14 --> 03:21:41.18 the best well it senses factually the best you love your flavor the best well you ever drink another
03:21:41.18 --> 03:21:47.18 different kind yes yeah okay see that's what's weird only because I don't want to come on I
03:21:47.18 --> 03:21:51.26 don't have any I got a cup of tea and right in them and you know there's that but if you had
03:21:51.26 --> 03:21:59.02 all flavors in a fridge every for one year yeah I can do one year yeah and I was restocking years
03:21:59.82 --> 03:22:05.66 whatever after replace a sour apple sniper you would never have to know here's a thing I could do
03:22:05.66 --> 03:22:11.10 one year but in the spirit of you know nature and all that stuff like if you're eating steak
03:22:11.10 --> 03:22:16.38 every single night and someone offered you to throw off the path of the of the mango man in
03:22:16.38 --> 03:22:21.42 the spirit of variety yes okay for sure well that's you know that's the I think that's natural
03:22:21.42 --> 03:22:29.66 I'm pretty sure I would only drink jockel Palmer because it takes so good to me yeah but I also only
03:22:29.66 --> 03:22:35.02 stakes so there you go see because you're different all right so we got a drink is what you're saying
03:22:35.02 --> 03:22:41.10 it doesn't matter what flavor you choose to drink at any particular time regardless if mango is the best
03:22:41.10 --> 03:22:47.58 flavor it's all healthy for you so you drink in the energy drink you get in the front end the
03:22:47.58 --> 03:22:54.62 energy a little boost that we sometimes want boom but you get the health benefits as well as
03:22:54.62 --> 03:22:59.18 opposed to the poison benefits or lack of benefits or whatever that's your next year on a
03:22:59.18 --> 03:23:05.58 summer adventure either way discipline go you can get this at wall wall vitamin shop
03:23:05.58 --> 03:23:13.98 yep Amazon yeah and origin USA.com also we have jockelfield.com jockelfield.com
03:23:13.98 --> 03:23:17.74 yeah but jockelfields the easier you remember yeah yeah that's the direct one of you
03:23:17.74 --> 03:23:22.22 you don't got to click around all that stuff also that joint where for this for your joints
03:23:22.22 --> 03:23:25.42 when you're lifting hard doing jiu-jitsu like you don't want to worry about the joints if you
03:23:25.42 --> 03:23:29.26 don't want to worry about your joints this is the one that we need I don't want to worry about
03:23:29.26 --> 03:23:33.02 that joints yeah it's gonna be pretty rare you can want to worry about your joints but I don't know
03:23:33.02 --> 03:23:36.46 some people are more in touch with that kind stuff and that's cool too either way
03:23:36.46 --> 03:23:42.46 join our her and super krill oil will make sure that they're still in the game longevity man
03:23:42.46 --> 03:23:49.90 hey if you had the greens yet no well we have greens now all right and decide to come up with a creative
03:23:49.90 --> 03:23:59.50 name jockel greens we made some very good greens and so you can check those out to live you if
03:23:59.50 --> 03:24:08.30 you don't eat enough vegetables like me or fruits like me yeah now you can put in a scoop yeah that's
03:24:08.30 --> 03:24:14.38 good and and again you know true jockel style apparently you're making these things taste good
03:24:14.38 --> 03:24:19.66 yeah which is very not hard core of you by the way but it is very efficient and when it's a little
03:24:19.66 --> 03:24:24.62 it's real low drag it's also results related right we're not trying to feed not trying to get you
03:24:24.62 --> 03:24:30.22 to drink something that tastes like junk yeah and then you don't drink it because it tastes like junk yeah
03:24:30.22 --> 03:24:35.74 why would we do that you're not trying to offer up another element of resistance in a good
03:24:35.74 --> 03:24:40.94 path that we're all on yeah yeah it's true that's a good move also vitamin D3 cold war immunity
03:24:40.94 --> 03:24:46.62 stuff this is essential so don't forget about that kind stuff also mok he's talked about stakes
03:24:46.62 --> 03:24:52.22 I get it but sometimes you want to extra this back on the strawberry path right now you are going
03:24:52.22 --> 03:24:57.10 hardcore strawberry for like a week and a half I was going hardcore peanut butter for at least a
03:24:57.10 --> 03:25:01.42 month what's the what's your normal probably putting anything in there in the little banana
03:25:01.42 --> 03:25:08.38 little whatever what are you just straight mok mok and some variety of milk could be cooking up milk
03:25:09.02 --> 03:25:15.02 could be almond milk could be the milk could be the milk could be the milk milk milk milk milk milk
03:25:15.02 --> 03:25:20.46 milk but yeah mix it up with one of those and they all taste legit they all have their own little
03:25:20.46 --> 03:25:25.98 sshsh you know yeah you don't know my protocol watch up in freaking on and it's freaking solid and
03:25:25.98 --> 03:25:30.62 it tastes good I don't know though so is it normal like what do you let's say you had a salad like not
03:25:30.62 --> 03:25:37.50 like a side salad but up a rope us salad you know you stick salad chicken salad whatever
03:25:37.50 --> 03:25:42.30 what do you drink with that what's the norm what pairs with that that don't say I know you can say
03:25:42.30 --> 03:25:47.34 water I know okay what's the jam you don't want to say water all right well water kind of
03:25:47.34 --> 03:25:50.94 goes with everything you always get what at the restaurant thinking to give you the water first
03:25:50.94 --> 03:25:55.90 that's the given but what is you know what's the jam your story your thing is not going anywhere
03:25:55.90 --> 03:26:00.94 swear where you go with this okay you're a lot of my what I pair with a big salad it's called
03:26:00.94 --> 03:26:10.38 the big salad chicken very robust salad um mok shake but just a plain one though plain like
03:26:10.38 --> 03:26:14.22 not usually I had a banana or frozen banana there or whatever not I don't know whatever
03:26:14.22 --> 03:26:19.66 so I'll go the peanut butter peanut butter chocolate and then milk or the almond milk or whatever
03:26:19.66 --> 03:26:25.34 just you know you don't add the oatmeal or bananas or whatever if you want to make it all luxury or whatever
03:26:25.34 --> 03:26:31.66 you can see but it like pairs nicely right off all right well either way these things again
03:26:31.66 --> 03:26:38.14 jockelfuel dot com subscribe if you want to influx you know where you don't got to remember
03:26:38.14 --> 03:26:43.50 to reorder or run out and all that stuff you don't have to remember you don't have to pay shipping
03:26:43.50 --> 03:26:50.86 oh yeah those are two real solid elements true so we mentioned origin us a dot com
03:26:52.06 --> 03:26:57.50 this is where you can get your American made denim yeah kind of a big deal no it's a real big deal
03:26:57.50 --> 03:27:01.42 yeah when you kind of go down the line it's like sure you get in good jeans I can't it that's this
03:27:01.42 --> 03:27:07.50 good it's great actually but I hear something crazy when we first looked into making these jeans
03:27:07.50 --> 03:27:15.74 hmm we were talking to people we were talking to people in the fashion industry legit
03:27:15.74 --> 03:27:19.50 I know yes I understand you don't much they wanted us to charge for a pair of jeans American
03:27:19.50 --> 03:27:24.54 made jeans you don't look the value placed on American 100% American made jeans were taken guess
03:27:24.54 --> 03:27:31.66 I'm much 118 I'm not kidding you they said the good market price
03:27:31.66 --> 03:27:42.70 $450 for a pair of jeans this was like a New York city with fashion paper and I like
03:27:42.70 --> 03:27:49.26 kicked Pete under the table like but I started $450 for a pair of jeans no that's not happening
03:27:49.90 --> 03:27:53.82 and we walked out I'm like that's not a big six not happy I was like he's a calm down you know
03:27:53.82 --> 03:27:58.62 I was kind of losing it because you know I already don't like fashion people in the first place now they want
03:27:58.62 --> 03:28:03.10 to be a person charge 400 because they're trying to they're trying to keep the control the market
03:28:03.10 --> 03:28:08.22 right trying to keep that thing elevated because they want to charge 450 for their pair of jeans
03:28:08.22 --> 03:28:14.54 yeah but you know the whole idea of charging that much for jeans like whatever they're doing
03:28:14.54 --> 03:28:19.58 there like it's not a matter of like hey we got a you know and it makes this logistical
03:28:19.58 --> 03:28:24.06 sense not that they're doing something oh no they're inflating the prices yeah for a reason like
03:28:24.06 --> 03:28:27.74 they're doing what's their thing what are they doing like that thing I think I'll tell you what they're
03:28:27.74 --> 03:28:33.34 doing they know that people want to buy American made stuff they know they can't make it they want
03:28:33.34 --> 03:28:36.54 us to price it out of the markets then after worry yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
03:28:36.54 --> 03:28:41.42 yeah that's what we've been doing that makes sense what I'm playing there games well the good news
03:28:41.42 --> 03:28:48.22 is it doesn't cost 450 999 whatever you should so boom there you go you also got boots on there
03:28:48.22 --> 03:28:54.70 yeah by the way saying American made 100% bringing back the industry by the way expanding like
03:28:54.70 --> 03:29:01.42 cheese Luis for us cheese Luis goes but I'm saying there's a bit of there's a lot going on
03:29:01.42 --> 03:29:07.74 there's a lot going on there's a bit of conflict that's a bit of a lot of things yeah but yes so
03:29:07.74 --> 03:29:11.42 ordinary USA there's a lot of cool stuff and you did so stuff on there as well yeah you get that
03:29:11.42 --> 03:29:15.18 key yeah you get the key if you're getting back into you just to where you get your staying in
03:29:15.18 --> 03:29:20.54 digits you want another key okay I want to come you did it not you talked about with Jason
03:29:20.54 --> 03:29:26.78 Go Rock awesome good community do you do you also community you sure also we have a store
03:29:26.78 --> 03:29:32.14 it's called jocco store so boom if you're on the path you want to represent discipline equals freedom
03:29:32.14 --> 03:29:36.38 good take the high ground or the high ground will take you
03:29:37.42 --> 03:29:44.06 swirking your shirts and hoodies and hats and whatnot some shorts on there utility surfing swimming
03:29:44.06 --> 03:29:50.70 cruising left in jiu jie I said it all of it everything they're a little at hybrid or whatever
03:29:51.34 --> 03:29:55.02 anyway got some shorts on there too you know we talk of shorts with cargo pockets no
03:29:55.74 --> 03:30:01.10 well you can't be wearing them for swimming or jiu jitsu if they have the pocket on them the big
03:30:01.10 --> 03:30:08.14 pockets for the cargo cargo pockets no you can have a little cargo pocket on there not a freaking baggy
03:30:08.14 --> 03:30:16.78 like from the gap store cargo pocket from 1994 it does not have that no but the hate like the
03:30:16.78 --> 03:30:20.94 the pocket that you stick your hands into on the front you can't do jiu jitsu with those and swimming's
03:30:20.94 --> 03:30:28.06 not recommended oh yes you can trust me can well you might be able to it's not off
03:30:28.06 --> 03:30:32.38 yeah well maybe I'll put like zip can you put zippers on them that would be making a little bit better
03:30:32.38 --> 03:30:41.42 we need to do a pair of shorts with a slim pocket on the leg no wait and I think these are
03:30:41.42 --> 03:30:46.46 yeah I don't have to double check but they have like the pocket is kind of it breeds like through
03:30:46.46 --> 03:30:51.98 so the water can pass through I'm wearing them right now they do have that but that still see
03:30:52.54 --> 03:30:56.38 but you know what I'm doing right now working I'm paed get their good their excellent for podcast
03:30:56.38 --> 03:31:02.38 yeah right there excellent for cruising for sure swimming is marginal because that even though the
03:31:02.38 --> 03:31:07.34 water is made to drain out of them it's still your there's big pockets hold water we're not
03:31:07.34 --> 03:31:12.22 setting we're not swimming in the English channel yeah actually no no that's a thing so yeah so there's
03:31:12.22 --> 03:31:18.30 that and then jiu jitsu you know your toes get in the pond there or whatever so let's redesign
03:31:18.30 --> 03:31:25.98 yeah sir I always didn't redesign well are we lagging we're working on that one okay no it's
03:31:25.98 --> 03:31:31.98 it's a working progress or whatever but the good thing about this is swimming jiu jitsu I know
03:31:31.98 --> 03:31:37.18 you toes get stuck in there and it's true but it's they're not ideal because really what's ideal
03:31:37.18 --> 03:31:41.18 for jiu jitsu really it's like spats on our ashguard same thing we're swimming what's ideal for
03:31:41.18 --> 03:31:45.50 swimming go limpics check it out that's what's ideal for swimming okay a lot of us sometimes we don't
03:31:45.50 --> 03:31:49.26 on a way that can't stuff when we go swimming yeah some of us I don't understand if we're not
03:31:49.26 --> 03:31:55.58 swimming though English channel I get it we can jump in the in the in the surf zone if you if we're
03:31:55.58 --> 03:32:00.78 just cruising right now and then we just find yourself at the beach I don't know or like
03:32:00.78 --> 03:32:06.38 frickless go body surfing you can wear those shorts as I'm saying yes and they're gonna work great
03:32:06.38 --> 03:32:13.74 they're gonna be acceptable very it's not optimal they'll be appropriate oh but that now they're
03:32:13.74 --> 03:32:19.42 really good for normal life yeah which is what I wear them for but if I'm gonna roll I'm gonna put
03:32:19.42 --> 03:32:24.54 on a different pair of shorts that we need to make jocco store dot com let's see where you get all

03:35:05.02 --> 03:35:10.78 to the book because there was a there was a worker there was a audio engineer yeah
03:35:10.78 --> 03:35:15.34 she was named Deb she was in their work in the work in the
03:35:15.34 --> 03:35:24.78 this is what this is what this is what's fired up there's funny parts in that book
03:35:25.34 --> 03:35:31.50 right and she she's outside the glass right I'm in the I'm in the room right she's outside the glass
03:35:31.50 --> 03:35:35.26 and I'm watching her and like I would read a funny line and I can see her she's like laughing
03:35:35.26 --> 03:35:39.42 she laughing like laughing like laughing at me like nodding her head and then there's a
03:35:39.42 --> 03:35:43.98 couple point parts in the book that are kind of like fired up like they're gonna go and she was
03:35:43.98 --> 03:35:48.30 literally raising your hands like I look at her like raising her and like they're gonna go

03:35:55.10 --> 03:36:03.58 day two stuff starts getting a little bit going sideways day two Deb openly weeping that I can
03:36:03.58 --> 03:36:11.34 visually watch her crying that's like reading like the some parts of the story that are heavy
