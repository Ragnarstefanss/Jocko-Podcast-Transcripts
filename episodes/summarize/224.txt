I mean, you know, I, I grew up without a father, you know, and I had like an uncle and a grandfather who I would spend time with for periods of my childhood who were good role models for me and like provided some stability and like some idea of what, you know, a virtuous man looked like and strong man with his, with his life together looked like, but like all of a sudden I had this dude who was like, he was just like a rock, you know, and he was, and the thing that the thing that boot camp did for me that I think this is probably the biggest lesson most, most kids who were just unstructured get out of it is when they would do things like you remember when they would do things like, you know, one drill instructor would come up and tell you to, you know, make your rack and do all these other things like you got a half hour to do it and he'll leave and then another one will come and tell you to do a whole bunch of other stuff that's going to take you 29 minutes. and then I pick, you know, for the, for all of the graduating divisions, I was the honor recruit and so they made me an E3 anyway coming out of boot camp and, you know, from then, like once I got into the technical school pipeline, you know, I was the class leader all the way through, I ace all my schools and I was just like, you know, on point it was just, you know, it was nice to know the rules of the game and to know that if I do the following things right, then people are going to people that I respect and who's approval I want are going to be happy with me and you know that just sort of the incentives and inputs were, you know, it's hard, it's hard to describe when you come from such an unstable environment how liberating it is to be in a place where, you know, there are known rules to the game and you know, you know, how to play it. I'm sure this is uh we'll talk about this in a future time when we get into when you had to talk to the sheaks and Romadi and stuff we had to work through you had to work through it a whole tribal system that plays no role over here you know we just don't have anything like that over here and when we when we have like little versions of it with like uh you know um say like the Italian mafia back in the day or something where there's still this sort of in group mentality and stuff that starts to it's hard to keep that together in the United States and a lot of the institutions we have are kind of designed to break down those subloilties so that you know there's this broader national loyalty that we all kind of devote ourselves to you know the half fields and McCoyes have to figure out how to uh how to you know how to put their differences aside and get on the same landing craft and go storm the beaches in Normandy you know they got to figure how to do that There's nothing that's closed off to you just kind of by the nature of life, you know, and when you, uh, when nobody kind of teaches you that, and for whatever reason you don't pick it up in other ways, you know, maybe you, you know, you figure out when you're 30 that like, oh, if I want to start focusing on this when I was 15, then, you know, whatever, but like most people get to the point where, by the time they start to, if they come out of that state, you know, they've got so many obligations or the couple kids, whatever it is that now your life is kind of on a certain track, and, you know, that's the thing that I would love to get into my kids heads, that, you know, there are no limits to what you can do if you decide you want to do it. and it's just a beautiful thing that if that could come out of that then you know her death could be turned into a sacrifice you know where something good could come out of something that really just by itself is just a horrible thing you know my sister struggled her whole life she never really had anybody who you know was kind of putting her first in the way that you know like when when when the kids would get farmed out to different relatives and stuff I would go somewhere my other sister Lindsay would go somewhere and it was kind of rewarding to have us around you know we would do well in school and just like whatever it was it was some it was a little bit rewarding my youngest sister she was just she was harder she had a temper she was just kind of like a more wild personality it was kind of just more of a more of an ordeal than a in less rewarding and then I'm putting the amount of work in this that it deserves so one of the things that I I do that my one of my recent ones took a long time the Jim Jones one that I'm doing because I just I refuse to put out an episode until I feel like I can at least have a glance of what it would be like to put myself in the shoes of the people that I'm talking about and if I just if there's people in there that I'm gonna be talking about who I just don't like or who I just have can tempt form and sort of a cartoonish way which is how I felt about a lot of the people in Jim Jones' movement for a while I just don't like these people they just elicit nothing but negative emotions in me and I just refuse to make the episode until I could get through that you know and try to figure out what are the circumstances that these people could be looking at that could make the decisions that they're making make sense to them at the time and you know that can be really hard to do like you know I've been reading a whole lot about how I'll cut in a rack and all that stuff now and so I start making like the first episode and the second episode and by the time I kind of you know I'm outlining them and kind of put them together and by the time I kind of get up to like episode three or four of like how I'm making my outlines now I've read like 20 or 30 books and I would look back at like the first episode that I had put together when I'd read like six and I realized it was it was hilariously bad like not just like you missed this little point here you know um there's little thing you know do you trust your neighbors um you know do you uh just have you know are your concentric circles of concern sort of expanded enough to the you know where they get to the point uh that they include people that maybe you don't know but that you still consider at least relative to somebody way over there like one of us you know and where does that where do those circles of concern end you know do they end at the tribe it was a lot to handle when people started listening to it and start writing me emails I've got an emails from from Israeli Defense Force active duty guys running patrols in the last bank who have written me and said that like this maybe sympathize with the Palestinians more right that's it dude who that matters that's a guy who like is gonna be dealing with these people tomorrow on patrol and I've gotten emails from people from Arabs Muslims all over the Middle East who said I never I never thought about the situation that the Jews were in in that way before and I'm like it's a it feels like it's a pretty heavy responsibility but at the same time like it's you know it makes it so that like you really feel like And whether this is true or not, it's the impression they get, is that Jaco seems like this guy who, like, turned 18 or whatever, got out of high school and just, I know exactly what I want to do and now from now, this point on, like, for the rest of my life, like, I'm going to just focus on becoming that thing and everybody's like, God, I wish I could have, like, had something like that when I was, whatever age, most people go through their whole lives and they never, you know, have that level of, uh, a vision of what they want to become and then being able to focus on it. Maybe some people find a way to overcome it, but I think most people, they just learn to live with it and, you know, sort of, put in its proper place, its whispering, the back of your head all the time, then no matter how things look around, you no matter what other people are telling you, no matter how good your life is going, it's end of the day, you're basically worthless, you know, you come out of the gutter, and that's where you belong, and it's just, it's something that, you know, when you come from a certain kind of background that is going to be in there, it's like, you know, when a Roman general would be celebrated in a triumph and they'd be in their chariot on a parade and everybody's cheering for them, they would put, you know, a slave behind them to whisper in his ear that despite all this, you were only mortal, just to remind them of that, it's like a really pathological version of that. so it's basically like a neck a gator let's another thing it gets called I don't know what to call it but most people call it a buff anyways we put a little pocket in there so you could put a filter if you can get one if not you can still just use the mask and it does help and the CDC actually has numbers out like how much it helps if you just put a t-shirt it helps you know 20% if you put a bandana and a t-shirt it helps 40% like they calculate this stuff so anyways that's what's happening we we started making these masks people been buying them like crazy because you know we're getting orders from hospitals we're getting orders from nurses we're getting orders from doctors like that's maybe so I got to know if you had direct neighbors but like the power would go out right and the power would go out and people would walk out like on their front lawns and kind of look around like whoa you almost have this sense of connectedness with your neighbors that you don't have on a normal day you know because everything kind of shuts in you kind of realize like whoa we're just here together like at this point wonder what's gonna happen and it's and you grew up in the idea of like who am I or who are we as a people and you can one of the early Israel Palestine ones when I was kind of talk about how you know the Zionists are pulling people from all over Jews from all over Europe and trying to get them to think of themselves is like you know this is a time when like German Jews didn't really like Polish Jews and American Jews kind of looked down all of them in certain ways and to pull all these people together and be like no Like I had had that happen, and then it just my life had been like one, you know, this tumbling momentum up to this point that had led me to a place where I'm lying on my friends, you know, tile floor with my crap running up my back, and I'm just laying it with my head ringing, trying to figure out like just just going over all of the horrible decisions that I had to make to end up in this situation, and all of the offerings that I had to avoid it, like I could have just gone to his garden, I could have just, you know, trapped in the toilet upstairs and solved the toilet paper problem, like, across that bridge when I got to it. And it's just, you know, most of the time throughout, you know, my whole life and this is still a, you know, I have like a little bit of a doctor do a little kind of thing going where or Mr. McGoo rather, where, you know, I'm always up in my head, you know, I'm always thinking about whatever book I just read or, you know, whatever book I'm about to read and when we do talk about it it's usually charged with a lot of emotion one way or the other and so rather than and it's usually attached to you know ideas of historical grievance and things like that so we'll say that you know a group that has some has some grievance they it's okay for them to sort of identify in a group manner things like that but rather than just talking about it as a psychological need that people have I mean when you come up as a kid like I did where you know you're just you're just kind of pasting an identity together out of random bits people that pass through your life of things you see on TV book you read you're just kind of pasting something together And when you're coming up in a very unstable environment, one of the things that happens is your time horizon just gets shrunk down and shrunk down until, you know, you're really trying to figure out how to get through the next week or the next day or the next, you know, class or whatever it is and thinking about the future, you know, I mean, I can't remember as a kid, like, you know, maybe maybe I watched Jurassic Park and like, I want to go dig up dinosaur bones or something, but as far as like a serious vision from my life and now. it's just this typical like American broken down family scenario right that it just fallen apart it was just it had fallen apart and that and that when we all came together for her funeral that it was as if everything like everything was redeemed but by you know during that period it was like everything that had been bad and broken was suddenly repaired and something that it wasn't like a not repairs and not the right way to say it because it wasn't like there was this there was this family there that had gotten broken up and now it got fixed it didn't exist before so something that was born out of that tragedy and I realized that you know if I could it doesn't clear up all the negative feelings obviously And you know what the right things are, maybe you don't know what the right things are, like a grand scale, but you know how to, right, you know how to clean your room, you know, the little things that you don't do every day. So I had that in my brain, but the, I think when I realized, oh, yeah, you know, I was thinking about this the other day, there was a friend of the family who had an older son who is a Marine Corps drone instructor and when he came home for leave or something and he had a, uh, a Chevy, like SS, right, a Chival, and or, oh, oh, he had a bad ass muscle car and you know, he was a Marine Corps drone instructor and I was like, okay, you know, I don't know how old I was, but I wasn't old. And that's something that you have to learn, you know, I, I was fortunate enough that, you know, I had a couple of coaches at various times for brief periods, but they made enough of an impact that, you know, things got, you know, that I had a different way of looking at things, but even me, like I didn't start to get that until, until I was in the Navy, you know, probably I was 22, 23. so if you're a vet go to eF Legion dot com and get your information in there and then companies we we got a bunch of companies that are looking that's where they're if you're company and you want to find

Cooper he's got like I said his podcast market made he's on Twitter Instagram and Facebook at market made he's going to be on a podcast with me called the thread and on top of that if you hadn't had enough of my grading slow-paced voice or you haven't heard enough of Ecos high pitched meandering's then you can still find us on the interwebs on Twitter on Instagram and on geodfice book Ecos at acochrals 9 at jockelwillink and thanks again Darrell for coming on thank you much appreciated thanks for the effort that you put into your podcast and thanks for sharing your story here and hopefully we can continue to get after it sharing people stories and helping people see stories in the right light and do everyone else out there that's in uniform right now hold the line around the world right now holding the line thank you for what you're doing out there in uniform and to police and firefighters and law enforcement and paramedics and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers and boarded patrol and secret service thanks for holding the line here at home and on top of that right now to all the doctors and nurses and all the medical personnel that are on the front lines here at home every day taking risk to fight illness thank you for taking care of us when we need it most and to everyone else out there the world is an uncertain place and sometimes the trajectory of your life comes down to a little bit of chance and what I'm saying is don't take that chance very often and stack the deck in your favor and the way that you do that is by going out there taking control and getting after it and until next time this is Darrell Cooper and echo and jaional control out or I say it is possible that people have some kind of a void where they are looking to be a part of something and that's why you know you get whether it's you know ISIS jihadists and by the way those are people some of those ISIS jihadists leaving normal you know first world countries to go and be part of a death cult you know that's why you get jammed jones that's why you get these things unfolding because there's some kind of a void that people have when they want to be connected to other people and they can't figure it out and when the when they when that light gets shine down well it's a light that's getting shine down by a bad person's there was an interview I saw I never forget they were interviewing one of the guys who had gone from Belgium perfectly nice life in Belgium to go join ISIS and yeah sure enough like over here you've got at this table like you know to white people to black people having a meal together over here you've got like two gay dudes having breakfast together just all different types of people they don't know each other they're not related to each other um and they're just they're all good and like I mean peep had a man you know the the girls were making them like that Monday morning and filled up a box and got them to boss and children hospital like that you know ASAP because that's where they're at and they're reusable like you can put them in a washing machine you can't put a surgical mask or uh whatever $2 surgical mask in the washing machine it'll be destroyed you can put these things in the washing machine all day long what up now but she doesn't know if like you know at a certain point or you enableing you know at a certain point you have to put your foot down you know she's stealing out of my purse to do things when she's at my grandparents house you know she's trying to raid their medicine cabinet it's like everybody just kind of looked at each other and realized it like whatever has happened in the past like none of that matters like we all you know we're a family we need to look out for each other we all love each other and we need to be a family again and you think about like what is the difference between a martyr and a murder victim When I was like two years old, I think I was laying on a bed with my father, I must have been too or younger, because he was out of the picture when I was two, and he used to like to cut wedges of green apples and put a little bit of salt on them and eat them, and I was eating these with them, and we were watching a TV that was like, I'm one of those stands like up in the corner, so that's one flash, and then there's a couple of other flashes like that, and then there's a flash when I'm five years old, and I know it, because I was in kindergarten at the specific school that I was at, and I had just shipped my pants. and that it's like that was good when like I was watching that video or there I think there's more than one right about the face masks of what pizza doing so it's interesting to see like you know under these kind of more for lack of better term extreme circumstances what people and groups of people in companies are doing you know but that you had I had no idea what I was talking about and then when I you know I think all the time now about like it's really easy to get me to pontificate for hours about some topic that I read one book about you know and these are this is a topic that like I had read six or eight books on at the time and having to look back and realize it I knew nothing about it like the most basic kind of had you already recorded a part number one you just laid out the notes yeah then it becomes a very easy to kind of sweet people into it and they offer I mean I think one of the biggest things is they offer people an identity you know identity something that in some ways we're not really comfortable talking about in in society these days we find it to be kind of dangerous social identity the way people the ways that people tend to connect themselves with larger groups and and movements it's something that we look at as pretty dangerous for pretty for pretty reasonable you know we have reasons for that right we look back at something like World War II so when you were you were like a touch you know or something too is it like it was in a white suit with this mask on like this I don't know like the eyes wide shut kind of thing And so to say that it's like going back a few decades, you know, it's kind of admitting that we've lost a little something down here and that, you know, maybe there's something that's going to be encroaching, you know, on the areas that still have, you don't like to think of it that way, but it's out of felt. and I think a lot of people aren't living any story and they're very vulnerable to people who come along and say I got a story for you you know I got something for you right here maybe it's Jim Jones maybe it's a Jehaadi maybe it's you know some racial group whatever it is I got a story for you you know that puts you right in the middle and takes you seriously it makes you important in a way that you've never been to anybody before makes it very vulnerable to those things no you know when you're old enough to reach it you can read it and just make it this place so that you know there was no kind of I wasn't in any kind of intellectual environment or anything like that when I was a kid and so to have like one of my kids uh to be able to go into a room like that right I'm smart enough that if you're explaining something to me I'll be able to understand what you're talking about I'm not some genius I just pound away on it every day like if I'm not happy with something like I tell them if the fact that you like my podcast and that you're understanding and getting down with like the concepts that I'm talking about shows you that you can work with these concepts everything that I'm talking about you're capable of talking about it's just a matter of like putting the work in and getting it done and showing up every day and grinding and that's how I get my podcast done yeah because that's essentially what what you're dealing with and what you said earlier about you know when you're young and you don't really know which direction to take and then all of a sudden somebody shows up that you know like we've been saying the whole time you you also know the rules the game whereas if you know if I was five maybe a darker color skin that instead they'd be pulling my ass in and throwing me in jail and then I'm not going into the navy and then I'm not just a whole train of things starts to happen you know where I just got I very very very lucky I know people who are way better way smarter way stronger than I am who ended up going completely off the rails and it deserve has nothing to do with it you know did they deserve it well they made decisions and that's what you want the path and that actually is a real thing now days even more than than before because you know how like you eat when you're bored you want a little tree you want a little you know you're not hungry you just want to want a little you know little something where I can walk all day problem and um yeah I love having them around that makes sense though with the six hours a day especially if you're into reading because like you know consider how you bust out your phone like anytime there's dead space in your day most of us are like bossing on our phone checking is checking that you know I always had to be careful that because I'd get the whole gang mentality going and it would be us against the world and you know everyone's no ha I'd have to pull back the reins a little bit because you know you got 22 year old JP to now and somebody says something bad about the task unit and he is ready to murder someone you know I have to pull the reins a little bit you know because it gets a little crazy in the in the days so what made you decide did you make first class then pretty quick pretty quick so it's like my primary point of reference in a lot of ways and what about um like just diving around on the internet how how do you discriminate when you Google search you know whatever how do you have any good methodology for saying because I like I'll be I'll go down the rabbit hole you know And I don't know what happened before that, and I don't know how I reacted to the situation, it's just like the vision starts, and I've cracked my pants, and then that's all I know, and like then it fades out, right? And so I call up my friend, and I'm like Richard, any of your doors open or anything like that, like is there a key somewhere, and I got to go to the bathroom, and he's like, I just piss in the bushes, I'm like, I gotta do the other thing. But, you know, getting to the point of realizing that like whatever the environment is around me, like, I've got my own responsibility to like, you know, take care of my own circle here. and you know you saw that combat all the time you know I've said many times there's there's times where I made bad decisions and and like got home and said to myself well got away with that I'd never should have got away with that I can't believe I got away with that got so lucky and there's other times we make the right decisions and things still go wrong and so she's got friends that are telling her you know and other people in her own her own mind you know just telling her like look at a certain point you have to give some tough love and and it makes sense you know that is what you have to do right at a certain point you are enabling And then the other thing is, and this isn't just true of kids that came from difficult backgrounds like I did, it's true of more and more people where, you know, people talk about like class privilege, you know, your parents, most of the way that that applies is not that your parents are going to leave you a bunch of money. but I feel no sense of pride in that because I know people who were better than me and who were stronger than me and who had better hearts than I do who didn't make it and that if there were a couple times growing up or in my early adulthood when if I had ziggged instead of zagging or even when I where I just I got purely lucky you know where I you know early 20s I get into a big fight out in town and the cops decide that it's they're just gonna let me roll out you know It's easy to shut up, you know, like especially if I'm like getting going, like, whatever, like, I'm just I'm coming. and then they didn't go in and things did not work out well for them at all and so when you look at like all these little decisions and just like you said I mean what you know how many people's lives have been ruined by you know the one DUI that they got which they crashed and they hid You know, that's kind of, that's kind of, I guess, what I would maybe define as an adult, right, is if you encounter something rather than having like a dependent mindset where you're looking around, who's going to fix this, you realize intuitively, you're the one, you know, and that doesn't happen for a lot of people for a long, long time in their lives, if ever, and it didn't happen for me until I made 20s. and it makes me I try to as much as I know that you know you can get into a toxic mindset self-limiting kind of toxic mindset by feeling like a victim so I you know I don't support that kind of thing
