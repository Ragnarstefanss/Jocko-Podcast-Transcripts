Yeah, it's one of those things where close guard if you're not a person who always plays closed guard or whatever it can be Just something that you kind of use for specific situations, you know like if you're trying to maybe Read Regain some energy or something like that you want to rest a little bit or even in like a self defense like a striking scenario like a close guard you'd be good hotel or gym easy That actually here's what you can do here's what I do when I go to the master or wherever If I'm there for like a week like the last master all like going Google maps and finding like all the gyms And be like all right, I'm gonna get that's kind of the commitment Obviously, you know, that's an interest. whatever and there's all the spots There it not as positive to think it's actual thing like you don't sleep and it's like your body Essentially goes into this like negative kind of feedback or positive feedback loop where it's like Just your overtraining and it takes like a while to get out of it like a while you gotta go through this process Yeah, I feel like I know that question where Yeah, I want it if I see like kids and animals it it doesn't make it harder, but it makes it like You're more sensitive, you know like you just stop just affects you more with your kids. I don't know in my Experiences what happened because you kind of can't you know like it messes you up when you see like like my wife will Read like uh trafficking like human trafficking art because he's stuff and you see That's like the known thing when but then you're trying to be all I don't know like smart or something like you know like Like this is for the the reable boot I'm not worried about it. And you can do calistening Anyway point there is I'm in that boat or lifting weights is not an option at this very moment for me So you got to kind of get creative so like a push up You can make the pushups harder if you put your feet up and the higher you put your feet You know the harder it becomes or you do like a one-on push-up situation and then you can do like a declant like um You know you go on a counter first, right? I would say this to like don't blind side your boss Right, that's something that if you're gonna leave leave on good terms Explain to what's going on also that can be an opportunity to start a conversation about how the leadership could Implude prove a lot of times people don't want to change anything until it really Smacks him in the face and one of the things that smacks him in the face is when one of their good people comes in and says hey look I I'm gonna leave because of these reasons and again you don't On the exit interview or on those conversations you don't just drop dime and make everyone make it out to be this horrible situation It's a here some things that I've noticed here some things that I would want to change here's the direction that I see the company going And this is the direction I think it should be going and for these reasons I've decided I'm gonna go try you know trying my hand somewhere else so you know how it like kid fit five year old women Roll with you know high level people people that you trust people who have like a lot of control over the The situation what about like let's say I you know on the 55 year old woman avatuin sister she's 55 Yeah because because a lot of time I know it was like this in like oh seven six maybe where Guys like I remember seeing people they like a lot of people were just becoming loan officers Well, isn't the whole kind like comic genius behind the character of Dwight Shrewt Is that he's so dorky like a Napoleon dynamite type guy right like he's like so dorky, but you like yeah You know, so you got a good opportunity How do you I think it's totally good to go what about even like socially you know like kind of like Oh, you want to think about it. so you know how like Being serious is like okay, you're not necessarily joking all the time But taking yourself too seriously is like you know if like a joke is made about you Or you can laugh at yourself for that kind of stuff. I can't relate to this guy this kid's kind of weird that the other thing is when you're 18 You don't even know how much those 30 year olds You just think you know you actually think you know more than you're looking at them like the 80 it's like why would you not You know Swing off this rope and see if you can get through the window on the third floor Why would you not do that? I know who you know that if you don't feel like working out you still work out That's the deal you still work out even you don't but everyone's about you really don't feel like doing it or You're so caught up in this other thing and you kind of play games with your mind You're like you know what I could skip the workout I think the extrovert if I'm not mistaken like look like has a need you know Like he's there they're like attracted to you know other people being there So that will have less neural muscular activity when you push it even if you're pushing heavy weights Then something like Graduate to like a barbell bench press right for example But even that even though you do have to balance so that's a big step up But even that you don't have to balance in certain planes certain planes of movement you don't have to balance like the what you call this with lateral whatever the lateral movement and a barbell bench press which is the bar You don't have to balance it's fixed but front and back or forwarding forwarding back whatever you do have to balance so you know still good Now go to dumbbells now you have 360 degree plane of Movement that you have to balance more neural muscular activity so dumbbells are better than barbells in that way Neurmuscular activity and you can adjust the weight so you can do things where you can only do three reps You can do things you can do 20 reps if you want so boom great exercise Carefully do it on hotel room, but just saying general so you can good exercise It's still there like if there was like if you were to see I don't know something good that I did like now and be like Oh, man, he's doing good that would give me satisfaction right now. but if you ghost them You can't overly ghost like you can't overly ignore Just be like hey, yeah, like literally like Yeah, yeah, So I can get by so that I can do what I want Artistically if that makes sense I actually had a guy the other day that was like saying You get up early But different people that are artistic They have to have a different path Because they you know if someone's going to kind of make music or they're going to They're going to draw or paint or they're going to write they need to have freedom I was like well, I'm kind of written some books and then and I play music in a band We make rock and roll you know what I mean? I'll tell you all the time pretty much with very few exceptions the way you get good at something is practice and then You know Usually since you can't do one thing all day every single day for you know 30 40 50 years It's gonna take discipline meaning you're gonna have to do it even though you don't want to do it kind of thing Which is part of what discipline But what if that part of it doesn't isn't there because even like Michael Jordan. it's a good one that's gonna be a good one eat some lobster too if you like lobster I don't know some people don't like like lobster Yeah, man, so like you know when you're in the office working You know that's what I tell kids too because that's a whole bullying thing is people kids kids get the feeling that being alone is bad Like being alone is not a bad thing you should be comfortable being alone. Hey, it's gonna be a lean Christmas and even you like by your own admission you said I You know, I do it where I live lean kind of thing like you don't have to do it that way like you can be He's a kind guy who's like just kind of down for anything not this kind of like Fire plug type guy because he's super mellow, but he's just down for anything like the kind where if you're gonna go do something kind of weird Yeah, Brad get some socks and go travel report back Anyway, on that dot-con slash chocolate let a real good stuff on there Improved yourself also when you are shopping or or when you're gonna shop for any of the books that chocolate recommends Including chocolate books by the way extra ownership the updated one way the worry kid both of them Dislinicals freedom field manual best kind of field manual or best kind of manual by the way field manual Kind of you can read in the field anyway when you're shopping for any of these books I kind of organized on jockelpodcast.com Jockels books are in the front page right there kind of in plain view Marie decided what type of the way but this is gonna stay the same I have a page though Jockel podcast books or books from the episodes what it's called anyway Top man you click on there.
