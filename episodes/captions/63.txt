[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 63.
[00:00:04] With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:07] Good evening echo.
[00:00:08] Good evening.
[00:00:13] I am an American fighting man.
[00:00:16] I serve in the forces which guard my country and our way of life.
[00:00:21] I am prepared to give my life in their defense.
[00:00:26] I will never surrender of my own free will.
[00:00:31] If in command I will never surrender my men while they still have the means to resist.
[00:00:39] If I am captured, I will continue to resist by all means available.
[00:00:45] I will make every effort to escape.
[00:00:48] I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy.
[00:00:55] If I become a prisoner of war, I will keep faith with my fellow prisoners.
[00:01:01] I will give no information or take part in any actions which might be harmful to my comrades.
[00:01:07] If I am senior, I will take command.
[00:01:11] If not, I will obey the lawful orders of those appointed over me and will back them
[00:01:17] up in every way.
[00:01:21] One question should I become a prisoner of war.
[00:01:25] I am bound to give only name, rank, service number and date of birth.
[00:01:32] I will evade answering further questions to the utmost of my ability.
[00:01:37] I will make no oral or written statements disloyal to my country and its allies or harmful
[00:01:44] to their cause.
[00:01:48] I will never forget that I am an American fighting man responsible for my actions and dedicated
[00:01:54] to the principles which made my country free.
[00:01:59] I will trust in God and in the United States of America.
[00:02:09] And that is the 1955 version of the Code of Conduct for the Armed Forces of the United
[00:02:19] States.
[00:02:22] And it was written in response to the brutal treatment of the 7,190 Americans captured
[00:02:32] by the enemy during the Korean War.
[00:02:35] prisoners who are subjected to torture, indoctrination, brainwashing and forced confessions.
[00:02:45] And that version of the Code that I just read is almost exactly the same as the one that
[00:02:50] I learned in the military when I joined in 1990.
[00:02:55] They did make some changes to it.
[00:02:58] They changed it to include men and women and they changed two words to give some flexibility
[00:03:05] to increase survivability and psychological recovery from torture.
[00:03:13] And so the little changes that were made it change from the prisoner being bound to give
[00:03:18] only name rank and service number and data birth to the prisoner being required to give
[00:03:25] name rank, service number and data birth.
[00:03:30] But the spirit of the Code didn't change at all.
[00:03:37] And that code is what we as military fighting men and women were and are expected to uphold.
[00:03:51] Should we ever be captured and held as prisoners by the enemy?
[00:03:58] What the Code of Conduct is simple and clear and straightforward.
[00:04:08] But the Code of Conduct gets tested unlike any other document in the world.
[00:04:17] When our American servicemen and women are somehow captured and as prisoners of war face
[00:04:25] absolutely ruthless levels of torture, pain, suffering, disease, starvation, humiliation
[00:04:35] and perhaps the most devastating hopelessness.
[00:04:44] And tonight it is my absolute honor to have one of these men here, one who during almost
[00:04:59] a full year of horror upon horror at the hands of his captors in Vietnam, man who persevered
[00:05:08] and fought with every ounce of his soul to survive against the worst possible conditions
[00:05:16] imaginable.
[00:05:20] A man that not only learned the code of conduct but lived it retired Army Colonel William
[00:05:33] Bill Reader.
[00:05:35] Sir, thank you so much for being here tonight.
[00:05:40] Thank you, Jacko.
[00:05:41] It's my honor and need to be here and participate in this podcast as well.
[00:05:46] Thank you.
[00:05:48] I want to just before we jump into the book, if you could just talk a little bit about
[00:05:54] you growing up what you did, what you were like, where you were.
[00:05:59] Oh boy.
[00:06:00] Okay, I didn't know this was coming.
[00:06:03] Yeah, I was essentially a kid off the streets of Los Angeles as born in the Lendale grew
[00:06:07] up for a time in the San Fernando Valley, which is in the opening prologue to the book.
[00:06:13] Yeah, I had a tough childhood, I guess.
[00:06:16] I would say, God into some trouble is a young guy.
[00:06:22] Sports helped me at least survive to graduate from high school.
[00:06:26] Left college and I went off to college in a race of Idaho to study forestry.
[00:06:31] Left college and less than a steamed academic terms after only one year worked for time
[00:06:37] as a work to all the time as a kid with various small jobs, newspaper routes and selling
[00:06:43] magazines to door to door.
[00:06:47] Then did some construction work in my early teens, roofing work?
[00:06:51] But yeah, after I left college, I worked gallerances for a while, worked for the U.S.
[00:06:55] Forest Service for a time.
[00:06:57] Ultimately, as a firefighter, I got laid off in the end of fire season, went back home
[00:07:01] to Los Angeles and found a job with Southern California Edison in Santa Monica, climbing
[00:07:06] power lines as a apprentice lineman.
[00:07:09] And did that until the outbreak of the Vietnam War and then found my real niche in life
[00:07:14] when I walked into the Army recruiter in Santa Monica, California, and signed on the dotted
[00:07:18] line.
[00:07:19] What year was that?
[00:07:20] 1965.
[00:07:21] So, you know, the Tonkin Gulf incident occurred.
[00:07:24] That's where the U.S. destroyers were attacked in 1964.
[00:07:29] We put Marines ashore in Denang in March of 1965.
[00:07:31] That's when I started talking to recruiters.
[00:07:34] First I was going to the Marine Corps, but somehow ended up in listing in the Army in August
[00:07:39] of 1965.
[00:07:40] And then was the transition to becoming a pilot?
[00:07:43] Yeah, so I started out in listed, I went to Basic Training and Advanced Individual Training
[00:07:49] at I.T. I was a T, I can't can't can't can't can't can't can't can't can't can't can't can't can't
[00:07:56] here.
[00:07:57] Member of a can and crew in an artillery unit and then applied for Officer Candidate School.
[00:07:57] And they took those with the highest test scores, you had to pass the series of interviews,
[00:08:01] but they were looking for officers and especially artillery, latinants.
[00:08:05] And so I went to artillery officer candidate school, six months of training, with some degree
[00:08:10] of harassment, and then got commissioned in August of 1966 as a second lieutenant in artillery.
[00:08:17] And then how long did you artillery before before he became a pilot?
[00:08:20] Yeah, that was about a year.
[00:08:21] I didn't think I was going to be able to fly.
[00:08:23] That's really why I didn't go in the Marine Corps.
[00:08:24] I wanted to be a pilot throwing two services.
[00:08:26] You could fly without a college degree.
[00:08:28] So this college dropout had hopes any of them Marine Corps or the Army when I went and saw
[00:08:33] the Marine recruiter, he gave me a battery of tests.
[00:08:36] And he said, yeah, you qualify for a flight and we can guarantee you a flight training.
[00:08:41] I said, okay, so what I have to do is as you go in as long as you pass a flight physical,
[00:08:45] you're good to go.
[00:08:46] So I could sense there was something a foot here.
[00:08:49] So before I went in, I went to a FAA flight service in Santa Monica, and he gave me the
[00:08:54] same flight physical the military does and tell me if I could pass it.
[00:08:58] So he gave me the physical and said, no, you wouldn't pass it.
[00:09:01] You said your right eye is about 20, 25 to 20, 30.
[00:09:04] You have an astigmatism.
[00:09:06] They require a perfect 20, 20 vision.
[00:09:07] You couldn't pass the flight physical.
[00:09:10] So I wrote off the Marine Corps.
[00:09:12] I wasn't going to do that.
[00:09:13] And I went into the Army instead thinking I would never fly.
[00:09:17] After I went to Officer Kennedy School, I commissioned, I was working in an Artillery Assignment
[00:09:21] at Fort Carson, Colorado, and went in for an annual physical.
[00:09:26] And when I got the physical, it came back 2020 both eyes.
[00:09:29] So I was in like Flynn took that down to the flight service and put my application in and
[00:09:34] went off to flight school.
[00:09:35] Awesome.
[00:09:36] Awesome.
[00:09:37] So I'm going to jump into the book here.
[00:09:43] You spent your first torn Vietnam.
[00:09:45] I think it was your first torn Vietnam.
[00:09:46] You were flying the Mohawk.
[00:09:47] Right.
[00:09:48] So first torn Vietnam.
[00:09:50] And by the way, we were talking about the podcast about how much risk you guys took in
[00:09:58] Vietnam as pilots.
[00:10:00] It's actually crazy.
[00:10:01] We'll get into more of that.
[00:10:02] But one of the things that struck me is I'm in the beginning of your book and you're
[00:10:05] talking about how you got shot down on your first deployment.
[00:10:07] It's Vietnam as a pilot.
[00:10:09] So here's you telling that story to your crew.
[00:10:13] When you're going your second deployment that you said, yeah, the first couple operations
[00:10:16] we've done here, they've been pretty exciting.
[00:10:18] But you know, I had some good ones on my last deployment too.
[00:10:20] By the way, I got shot down.
[00:10:22] So here, I'm going to go to the book here.
[00:10:24] This is what happened when you got shot down for the first time.
[00:10:27] Took a 37 millimeter, millimeter, millimeter, anti-aircraft hit in the right wing attacking a
[00:10:31] fuel, depo hitting under the trees.
[00:10:35] Last five mission in Louss over the Ho Chi Mintrail.
[00:10:37] I pulled up from a rocket run, wham the whole right side of the aircraft seemed to explode.
[00:10:41] We tumbled out of control.
[00:10:43] The right wing shattered and was on fire, worked at hard.
[00:10:46] Got back some ability to fly.
[00:10:49] Got the fire out.
[00:10:50] But we were descending fast.
[00:10:52] Could not hold altitude.
[00:10:53] Gave the command to eject.
[00:10:55] The observer went out.
[00:10:57] I pulled my seat handle right after.
[00:10:59] I had a very short parachute ride.
[00:11:02] I got partial shoot deployment before hitting the ground with a foot.
[00:11:06] We were crashing through the tree tops by the time I punched out.
[00:11:10] So for those people that don't know what all that means right there.
[00:11:14] That means when you pull an ejection handle on a, on a, on a, on a, on your in a plane,
[00:11:18] eject you out.
[00:11:20] But you're supposed to do it with some level of altitude, not when you're hitting the
[00:11:23] tree tops.
[00:11:24] So you're hitting the tree tops and that in the canopy, not opening all the way.
[00:11:29] That means that the full usage of the parachute isn't there.
[00:11:33] It's just sort of getting open and boom.
[00:11:35] It's the ground.
[00:11:36] My way man took a picture of my shoot down site and you can see the, the parachute is just
[00:11:41] all strong out and I'm laying there at the end of the parachute.
[00:11:44] I've never got a single oscillation.
[00:11:46] I got a partial shoot deployment hit the ground.
[00:11:49] I'm glad we considered laughing.
[00:11:51] And I am defending you by laughing at this.
[00:11:54] I don't know.
[00:11:55] No, you're not because you made a comment about, you know, taking the hits and the intensity
[00:11:58] come in, it was.
[00:11:59] It really was.
[00:12:01] But there's something crazy about young men and, and at that point in my life, I was a kid
[00:12:07] living a dream and I got blown out of the sky on my first tour.
[00:12:10] Yes, I survived it and somehow in my crazy twisted mind, I couldn't wait to get back
[00:12:16] over on a second tour flying covert tack helicopters.
[00:12:20] By the way, so this is what happens once you get on the ground, here we go back to the
[00:12:23] book that I was nearly captured.
[00:12:25] I ran through the jungle 45 minutes while my wingman put down suppressive fire.
[00:12:30] That earned me the nickname light foot.
[00:12:33] Got plucked out of the jungle by an air force helicopter from the 20th special operations
[00:12:37] squadron out of Thailand called the call sign pony express.
[00:12:41] Spent some time in the hospital there, eventually I returned to the unit back to flight
[00:12:44] duties.
[00:12:45] This incredible.
[00:12:46] We lost 15 airplanes at that point out of 18.
[00:12:51] 30 crew members shot down not many of them ever recovered.
[00:12:54] I was one of the few lousy odds.
[00:12:57] I was scared then I'll tell you if you don't get scared and combat your liar or nuts.
[00:13:04] Only after a tense mission is over.
[00:13:07] Does the real fright come?
[00:13:09] When there's time to sit and think you watched all play out in your mind and wonder how
[00:13:13] the hell you live through something like that.
[00:13:18] So again we were talking before before we pressed record about how protective of
[00:13:24] America is of its aircraft right now.
[00:13:26] I can't even imagine you guys had 15 out of 18 airplanes that were shot down.
[00:13:34] That's insane.
[00:13:36] That was a sophisticated expensive aircraft for the army at the time.
[00:13:39] The Mohawk was pretty much top of the line technology.
[00:13:43] The Army aircraft.
[00:13:56] That was a special unit.
[00:13:58] We had five Mohawk companies in Vietnam at that time.
[00:14:03] Four of them were for each of the four core tactical zones inside of South Vietnam.
[00:14:07] They flew missions and support of those areas.
[00:14:10] We were the fifth company, the bastard company.
[00:14:12] We flew out of Waifu Bay.
[00:14:14] The only time we saw South Vietnam was to take off some landings.
[00:14:17] All of our missions were in the Low, so we're up off the coast of North Vietnam.
[00:14:20] And then I had one highly classified one.
[00:14:22] I had to deploy down to Tonsonud at Saigon to go into Cambodia.
[00:14:26] I didn't know what that was all about.
[00:14:28] It was really high shots at the time.
[00:14:30] That was in the advance of the big Cambodian curves in the took place.
[00:14:33] Did they develop the Mohawk's four-vegetnome?
[00:14:37] Because it's an interesting aircraft.
[00:14:38] It's a side-by-side, right?
[00:14:40] And it's a prop plane.
[00:14:41] Yeah, twin-turbo prop was built purely for reconnaissance and surveillance, grumminer
[00:14:46] aircraft.
[00:14:47] But if you guys went ahead and put missiles on them, it rocked.
[00:14:49] We put rockets there.
[00:14:50] There were zoonie missiles, firebearing.
[00:14:51] We had rockets and pod-bounded machine guns.
[00:14:54] That led to my covert experience.
[00:14:57] Because I really, that was my favorite mission where the gun missions in the Mohawk, not all
[00:15:01] of Morar.
[00:15:02] But I liked the gun missions.
[00:15:04] When I came back my first tour, there was a spat between the Army and the Air Force and
[00:15:07] the result of the spat was we had to take all the armament off the Mohawks.
[00:15:10] So when I went back on second tour, I wanted to go on a gun ship, not something without
[00:15:14] gun, so that got me into cobras.
[00:15:17] Yeah, that's weird.
[00:15:19] Those bureaucratic spats happen and decisions like it, that get made, that's really disturbing.
[00:15:26] So let's get into your second tour, right?
[00:15:28] And I'm going to jump into this piece here.
[00:15:31] Back to the book.
[00:15:32] On April 14th, we received a radio call that fire base Charlie was under attack by two
[00:15:36] regiments, 3,000 soldiers of the 320th NVA infantry division and 130 millimeter artillery
[00:15:44] shells were pounding the position.
[00:15:45] So you guys get this call, this friendly base is being overrun basically.
[00:15:52] And you show up on the scene.
[00:15:55] Now you're fine, a cobra, which for those of you that don't know, a gun ship, as you
[00:15:59] just said, it's still in service today.
[00:16:02] The Marine Corps.
[00:16:03] So it was a very narrow skinny space on a hewie, right?
[00:16:08] Yeah, it was, you know, the hewie was designed and went to Vietnam and most of us,
[00:16:13] more or the hewie, the hewie took on a gun mission though, that Vietnam, we saw the utility
[00:16:17] of guns on an aircraft.
[00:16:19] So the cobra then was designed specifically and only as a gun ship.
[00:16:23] And they took the hewie designed, narrowed it down to 36 inches pilot in the backseat,
[00:16:27] a high pilot gun on the front seat, 2.75 rockets on the wing stores, many gun and 40
[00:16:34] millimeter grenade launcher and a movable nose turret and that was one killing machine.
[00:16:40] And it still apparently brings a giant smile to your face when you talk about that, which
[00:16:44] is lovely.
[00:16:45] Yeah, and I don't want to seem twisted.
[00:16:46] I mean, I said at the time, I was a kid living a dream and I was, but I don't want
[00:16:50] to take away from the horror of combat and it was scary as crap.
[00:16:55] On every single mission, but there's still something about a young guy going to war,
[00:17:00] at least a certain type of young guy.
[00:17:03] And those that were in the two units I served in, that yeah, we were dedicated what we
[00:17:08] did and I think we did it well and I'm still smiling about it.
[00:17:11] Well, like so far, every guy I've brought into this podcast has the exact same attitude.
[00:17:17] So you're among friends here.
[00:17:19] So I'm going now, you guys are there.
[00:17:21] You show up with your with your cobras back to the book.
[00:17:24] We made several passes on enemy guns.
[00:17:27] Bullet stream past our cockpit says the NVA gunners tried to bring us down, rolling in on
[00:17:32] a 51 position as always, DIC.
[00:17:35] So this is a 51 caliber.
[00:17:37] It's a Dishka.
[00:17:38] It's an anti-aircraft machine gun and they actually had those when we were in a Romadi.
[00:17:42] They still had Dishkas and they used them against us.
[00:17:47] Tracers come at you and miss by a few feet.
[00:17:49] We try to get rockets onto him before he gets lucky and blast you out of the sky.
[00:17:53] We took small arms hits.
[00:17:55] My knees vibrated like a sewing machine, but I focused on controlling the helicopter, lining
[00:18:00] up the gun sights and shooting.
[00:18:02] I was scared but had no time for it.
[00:18:05] Dan Radeode, Dusty, Sinai Panther 1, 3, Panther 1, 3, B advice, running low on fuel out
[00:18:12] of ammo, we're breaking station for rearm refuel.
[00:18:17] Roger 13, 4 gun crews taking out good work, hurry back.
[00:18:22] So you're rating to the guy on the ground.
[00:18:26] Who's there?
[00:18:27] So there's an American advisor on the ground with a bunch of selfie-intemies soldiers.
[00:18:31] They're being overrun.
[00:18:33] You come in.
[00:18:34] You're taking heavy fire, but you're giving back fire.
[00:18:37] You tell him, hey, we got to go and get some more ammunition.
[00:18:40] He's saying good job.
[00:18:42] Hurry back.
[00:18:45] When you do show up back, the NVA attack is now more intense.
[00:18:51] And here's the call that you get when you show back up Panther.
[00:18:55] That's you by the way, Panther.
[00:18:56] Pink Panther is your, is your call.
[00:18:57] So as you're call sign is Panther.
[00:19:00] Here's the call you get Panther.
[00:19:01] The Battalion Commander is dead.
[00:19:03] Acting Commander wounded.
[00:19:05] Enemy broken through on the southwest.
[00:19:08] Put it there first.
[00:19:10] Then all around us.
[00:19:12] But real close.
[00:19:13] So for those people that don't understand what this means.
[00:19:19] When you're on the ground calling for fire, it's, and I've talked about a lot of
[00:19:25] Fratur side and blue on blue situations.
[00:19:28] I had them on my deployment.
[00:19:30] And it's a very scary thing.
[00:19:32] And it's even scarier from the air to the ground.
[00:19:36] It's hard for people to understand this.
[00:19:38] When you're in an aircraft, it's very hard to see what's happening on the ground.
[00:19:42] It can be very easy to get confused.
[00:19:45] And so it's hard to bring fire very close to your position unless you are just in a
[00:19:52] terrible situation.
[00:19:54] And so when you get a call that's saying, put the fire all around us as close as you
[00:20:00] can.
[00:20:01] You know this is a desperate scenario.
[00:20:04] And so I'll go back to the book, Roger Dusty.
[00:20:08] We've got them after a number of cobra attack runs.
[00:20:12] Duffy called Panther Lee.
[00:20:13] This is Dusty cyanide.
[00:20:14] So that's the guy on the ground.
[00:20:15] That's his call.
[00:20:16] Synt dusty cyanide.
[00:20:17] You've broken the enemy attack for now.
[00:20:19] Hundreds of bodies in the wire may be a thousand.
[00:20:22] But we cannot hold.
[00:20:24] After a short break, he continued.
[00:20:26] We are leaving fire base Charlie now.
[00:20:28] Stop them from following us.
[00:20:30] Whatever it takes.
[00:20:31] Put your stuff right on top of the fire base now.
[00:20:37] And again, this is something that it just to explain what that means.
[00:20:45] If you don't understand what you've never in the military to explain, you're calling for
[00:20:49] people to drop fire onto your own position so that you can get away.
[00:20:55] It doesn't get any, there's nothing.
[00:20:57] It doesn't get any more intense.
[00:20:59] It doesn't get any more dramatic.
[00:21:00] It doesn't get any more sketchy than that right there.
[00:21:04] That was one hell of a fight.
[00:21:06] And John Joseph Duffy was the advisor, the American advisor on the ground.
[00:21:10] And he is a true American hero, Army Special Forces Officer had those advisor duties.
[00:21:16] That battle, the battle lasted for about two weeks.
[00:21:18] The climax of it was a couple days with that last night that has described in the book.
[00:21:23] Out of a 470 man, South Vietnamese airborne, peritrupt, batayan.
[00:21:29] At the end of that fight the next morning, the American advisor, John Joseph Duffy, and
[00:21:34] 36 of the South Vietnamese were all that survived to be picked up when they got off of that
[00:21:39] fire base.
[00:21:41] And John was wounded five times in the battle.
[00:21:44] So yeah, 470 man, batayan, 36 survivors and they're wounded American advisor.
[00:21:50] Absolutely unbelievable.
[00:21:51] And I know you wrote in here that Major Duffy was recommended for the Medal of Honor
[00:21:56] and he got the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions.
[00:22:02] Which if you don't know what that is, it's the second highest award underneath the Medal
[00:22:06] of Honor.
[00:22:07] Yeah.
[00:22:08] And you actually talk about possibly writing about that battle.
[00:22:12] Did you?
[00:22:13] That's my next project.
[00:22:14] In doing this book, and there's a statement at the beginning of the book that I wrote
[00:22:19] this some 40 years after I experienced these actions.
[00:22:23] And some things were still perfectly clear in my mind.
[00:22:26] Other things were a little bit hazier than I thought they would be when I put pen
[00:22:29] to paper.
[00:22:30] So in the process of writing, I not only just dug down a mine mind and relived every
[00:22:35] experience as detailed as I could to get everything correct.
[00:22:38] I contacted those who were also involved in the actions to get their versions, their
[00:22:43] view, their recollections to be sure I had this as right as I could.
[00:22:48] John Joseph Duffy was one that I got a hold of, Major Duffy.
[00:22:51] I had never met him and never talked to him since that battle until I was able to track
[00:22:55] him down with the wonders of modern communication and internet.
[00:22:59] And in sharing the details about that fight, he dropped a couple of hints.
[00:23:03] He said, you know, somebody really ought to write the history of the Battle of Firebase
[00:23:07] Charlie.
[00:23:08] This is one of the most extraordinary fights in the entire Vietnam War.
[00:23:11] So I think it was after about the half a dozen times he said, I said, okay, John, I'll do
[00:23:15] it.
[00:23:16] I'll write it.
[00:23:17] So yes, right now I'm working on doing my research and getting everything in order
[00:23:20] to write the story of that battle in more detail than I give on my what couple of pages
[00:23:24] of my book.
[00:23:25] Yeah, that's one of the one of the most interesting things for me about doing this podcast
[00:23:29] and we're again, another thing we're talking about is there's so many, you know, I didn't
[00:23:35] know about that battle and I'm a pretty decent student of military history.
[00:23:39] I didn't know about that battle and didn't know about Major John Duffy.
[00:23:43] I absolutely should and we all should and what you realize is that battle, that man will
[00:23:53] never be able to account for all these heroes.
[00:23:56] You just can't do it.
[00:24:01] So again, this is fast forwarding a little bit through the book and by the way, I didn't
[00:24:10] mention the name of the book yet.
[00:24:11] Oh, yeah, thank you.
[00:24:12] The name of the book is through the valley, my captivity in Vietnam by William Reader and
[00:24:21] hit this book.
[00:24:23] So at this point, I'm jumping ahead a little bit to a situation where you've got and
[00:24:33] I'll go to the book, tanks in the wire at Poli Kling.
[00:24:37] Launch now and call me En route for their radio freak.
[00:24:40] Hawks claw will get up later.
[00:24:43] You'll be covering him to you have tail number 053 and 682 go.
[00:24:49] So that right there is something bad is happening and you've got to go now and what's
[00:24:57] interesting, I'll point this out for again, people that aren't in the military.
[00:25:02] By the way, a lot of guys that listen to this are in the military, a lot of law enforcement,
[00:25:06] but there's a lot of civilians that don't know everything that I'm talking about or
[00:25:10] that you're talking about.
[00:25:12] So what I like about this is that what they're telling, what they're telling, the kernel
[00:25:17] to do is launch your aircraft, just go get an aircraft and launch and start heading
[00:25:21] in that direction.
[00:25:22] We'll give you a frequency when you get up there.
[00:25:25] We'll tell you what's going to happen once you get up there but go.
[00:25:28] So again, this is an in-extremement situation.
[00:25:31] What we would do that would be similar to this in the SEAL teams is we would go on QRF
[00:25:35] missions, quick and reaction forces where they would call, they'd happen to me where they
[00:25:39] call and say, hey, something's going on here at this location, go.
[00:25:44] And I'd say, who's the unit?
[00:25:45] We don't know yet.
[00:25:46] Any frequency, what radio frequency on?
[00:25:48] We don't know yet.
[00:25:49] We'll get it to you.
[00:25:50] Launch.
[00:25:51] We get in our vehicles and launch.
[00:25:52] You develop the situation and route and then when you lay eyes on, when you get there and
[00:25:56] start talking to the folks.
[00:25:57] Yeah.
[00:25:58] Exactly.
[00:25:59] Back to the book.
[00:26:00] I stuffed a small emergency radio into one of the pockets of my survival vest.
[00:26:04] No time to perform the normal check on the radio.
[00:26:08] I had to include that.
[00:26:09] There's a lesson learned there.
[00:26:12] I had to include that.
[00:26:13] You know, the radio will always work if you test it in the one time you don't test it.
[00:26:21] Is the one time to talk about that?
[00:26:22] That's the lesson.
[00:26:23] Check all your survival gear.
[00:26:24] Be sure it's in order to be regardless of how hot that mission is.
[00:26:29] Now, you're heading to a place called the Ben Hat and we're going to the book.
[00:26:35] We headed to Ben Hat as we crossed the last ridge line, the entire valley before us was
[00:26:40] filled with smoke. Tracer streamed outward from defensive positions inside the camp.
[00:26:46] Enemy Tracer's replied from outside.
[00:26:49] Two jet fighters bombed next to the camp.
[00:26:53] NVA rockets artillery and mortars exploded in the camp.
[00:26:57] Enemy tanks breached the perimeter.
[00:27:00] One inside and part way up the hill looked like it had been killed already.
[00:27:03] I couldn't be sure.
[00:27:05] An AC 130.
[00:27:06] An Air Force AC 130.
[00:27:08] Spectre Gunship was leaving.
[00:27:10] He'd worked the area over with 20mm of Volk and Gatling Guns and 40mm cannon's probably
[00:27:15] hitting the tank.
[00:27:17] Enemy infantry move through openings in the jungle canopy.
[00:27:20] I could see groups assembling to join the attack.
[00:27:26] Yeah, it was one heck of a heck of a battle.
[00:27:29] This whole situation we're getting to in the book occurred during the Easter offensive of
[00:27:34] 1972.
[00:27:36] When I arrived back in Vietnam at the end of 1971, it seemed like the war was over.
[00:27:39] In fact, I was afraid that maybe I'd missed my chance for combat in a cobra because things
[00:27:43] were so quiet.
[00:27:46] Many American, in fact, most American forces have been withdrawn in the central part of
[00:27:50] Vietnam, the central Highlands where I was operating, there were no American ground forces
[00:27:53] left at all.
[00:27:54] It's just some special forces guys, Army aviation units and some Air Force units.
[00:27:59] That was it.
[00:28:01] How that changed is we got into the spring of 1972 because the enemy had been building
[00:28:06] up their divisions across the border and to allow some Cambodia.
[00:28:10] In the spring of 1972, the Alonso attack from the Demolatrizone and attack from Cambodia
[00:28:15] towards Saigon and then finally in April attacks across the central Highlands where we were.
[00:28:20] There were a lot of enemy.
[00:28:22] This day it had been head, of course, this is going to turn into the day, the day that
[00:28:26] we're getting to here.
[00:28:28] Yeah, elements of two North Vietnamese divisions with artillery, with anti-aircraft weapons
[00:28:32] galore and with armor going into the camp and there we showed up with our two cobras
[00:28:39] to do what we could do.
[00:28:40] Was that your first time seeing armor, enemy armor?
[00:28:43] No.
[00:28:46] But that period was on the 24th because this is a night the May.
[00:28:50] On the 24th of April, the enemy attacked the 22nd Arvin, that's Army of Vietnam, division
[00:28:55] headquarters at Tancan, which is a little bit further to the east from Benheat.
[00:28:59] So in the 24th of April, the attack Tancan and defeated and overran that NVA division with
[00:29:05] a number of tanks.
[00:29:06] So that was the first time I saw tanks in battle, then we come out of the night the May and
[00:29:10] I'm seeing tanks again.
[00:29:12] Hold the different ballgame for the guys on the ground.
[00:29:15] Yes.
[00:29:16] Yeah, this guerrilla war suddenly turned into a very conventional war fighting regular
[00:29:21] North Vietnamese divisions.
[00:29:24] Now once again, you had some time on station, you did a bunch of shooting and running and
[00:29:29] gunning, you had to go back to reload, refuel, and I'm going back to the book now on our
[00:29:36] way back to Benheat.
[00:29:37] We could see the battle continuing at Policlo and Coli Clang.
[00:29:42] Vietnamese Air Force A1 Skyraders do dropping bombs.
[00:29:47] We passed close enough to see one as it trailed smoke and flame and went into the ground
[00:29:51] in an awful explosion.
[00:29:53] I saw a parachute and a May day call came over the radio emergency radio frequency.
[00:29:58] I called headquarters to tell them I was diverting for a few minutes to help cover the
[00:30:02] downed VNAAF.
[00:30:04] So the Vietnamese Air Force pilot, negative Panther 36 permission denied, proceed direct
[00:30:12] to Benheat out.
[00:30:14] You try to again, same results.
[00:30:16] So you saw the North Vietnamese Air Force pilot get shot down and you call back to base
[00:30:23] to say I'm going to go cover for this guy when they try and rescue him and they tell
[00:30:26] you know.
[00:30:27] Right.
[00:30:31] Now, so you do what you're told here.
[00:30:34] Yeah, decisions and combat.
[00:30:35] I mean, there's pluses and minuses to that.
[00:30:37] There were guys on the ground at Benheat and serious trouble.
[00:30:40] Benheat, there were two Vietnamese Ranger battions.
[00:30:44] So probably four or 500 people at the most, probably 400 people on the ground at Benheat
[00:30:51] with two American advisors.
[00:30:53] There's two Americans on the ground.
[00:30:54] They're under attack by elements of two North Vietnamese divisions.
[00:30:57] Which means thousands of infantry with the tanks, artillery, everything attacking.
[00:31:01] So yeah, they weren't in dire straits.
[00:31:03] Though I really had hope we could briefly stop over and help get this Vietnam Vietnamese
[00:31:08] Air Force pilot to pick up.
[00:31:09] Yeah, no, that's a tough decision for command to make.
[00:31:13] But from my position, I look at it like, okay, the command has a better overall view of
[00:31:17] the battlefield right now.
[00:31:19] And if they're telling me to proceed on to Benheat, God, even though you obviously is a pilot,
[00:31:24] you have a little good.
[00:31:25] I'm glad you have that perspective.
[00:31:26] I think now that at the time it all, well it's easy for me right now to send the air
[00:31:31] condition space with my heads at on.
[00:31:34] So much in Vietnam, and warfare is different today.
[00:31:38] And I think things are probably much more planned out and you go to a certain rules
[00:31:44] and procedures more than we did.
[00:31:46] So many of these combat missions with cobras in Vietnam and that day and age, we would get
[00:31:50] launched out of our base and we'd go out and make contact with people and it was pretty
[00:31:55] much up to the pilot and commander, the air mission commander, to decide where he would
[00:31:59] go and how he would support and what was the hottest fire in town that needed help.
[00:32:04] So we always, in some of it was just like, yes, our pompous attitude too.
[00:32:08] We always felt we had a better handle on what was happening than the guys in the headquarters
[00:32:12] that made some of those decisions.
[00:32:14] In fact, when we first saw tanks in the area before that battle at Tankan on the 24th of April,
[00:32:20] we saw tanks and reported them back through headquarters and there was a great deal of reluctance
[00:32:26] on the part of anybody and that Corps staff to believe that there were tanks.
[00:32:30] There was a guy that, in fact, this is another interesting situation at Vietnam, and that time,
[00:32:34] the senior commander in two Corps, that area that I was operating on, was not a military
[00:32:39] guy.
[00:32:40] So civilian named John Paul Van and Mr. Van made all the decisions.
[00:32:44] Now to keep things legal, he had a two-star army general officer working for him.
[00:32:49] So all military orders came through the army general, but Mr. Van was making the decisions.
[00:32:54] And when we reported we had seen tanks and mid-April, Van said, no, there's not tanks
[00:33:00] that I fly out there all the time if there are tanks I just seen him.
[00:33:03] He said, what you guys saw are probably elephants in the jungle.
[00:33:06] So that's what we dealt with with our headquarters.
[00:33:10] And that's interesting.
[00:33:11] There definitely was, when I was an Iraq, there was a very tight control over air
[00:33:16] to ground support, especially in the cities in Ramadi.
[00:33:19] It was very difficult to get bombs dropped.
[00:33:22] But you know, who had really good decentralized command was the tanks and the tanks that we
[00:33:28] worked with, they would come and they had pretty good control over what, you know, I'm
[00:33:33] talking the tank commander.
[00:33:35] Right.
[00:33:36] And at the company command level, we had some company commanders that would just get
[00:33:40] after it and they would make stuff happen.
[00:33:43] So we felt really comfortable working with the tankers and they supported us over and over
[00:33:49] and over again, really like I said, with a lot of decentralized command.
[00:33:53] You know, they couldn't, they had to use some, they obviously used discretion, but they had
[00:33:57] a lot of authority out there, which was great.
[00:33:59] Yeah, which we did as well, which was really good.
[00:34:02] So at any time, you left me, I'm going back from where we are and refueled a
[00:34:06] con team, we're heading back up.
[00:34:07] We're denied permission to deviate over to Polyclang and we're getting back into it
[00:34:12] and been at one more time.
[00:34:14] And now what you're doing, when I'm going to pick the story back up here, there's a Huey
[00:34:19] that's got recifying.
[00:34:21] So he's got, you know, bullets, probably bullets, water and food, maybe at this point,
[00:34:25] just bullets and they need to get that gear down to the guys on the ground.
[00:34:30] Right.
[00:34:31] The guys on the ground, the base had been pretty much completely overrun.
[00:34:33] The friendly said consolidated at a command bunker complex, or defensive dug-in positions
[00:34:38] at the top of the hill, which was their fire base.
[00:34:41] They were, when we got the call to cover that Huey, we were told that the guys on the ground
[00:34:45] were completely out of anti-tank ammo and were almost out of small arms ammunition and
[00:34:50] could we cover this Huey in for the receply.
[00:34:52] So here we go, back to the book.
[00:34:54] The Huey came in to a low hover near the command bunker.
[00:34:57] The crew kicked out the ammo boxes.
[00:34:59] The helicopter did a hovering turn and took off.
[00:35:03] I began a sharp left turn so I continued shooting suppressive fire for him.
[00:35:07] The enemy opened up on our two cobras with everything they had.
[00:35:12] My view left right and above and below was filled with tracers.
[00:35:17] Tim fired continuously and Tim was here.
[00:35:20] Tim was my front seat or my copilot gunner and the front seat working that nose turret
[00:35:25] while I was firing rockets.
[00:35:26] Tim fired continuously on those firing at us.
[00:35:29] We took large caliber hits all over the aircraft.
[00:35:32] Fifty ones like I talked about and 14.5mm rounds came through the cockpit.
[00:35:38] Hits from small arms always felt something like jiffy popcorn popping against its tinfoil
[00:35:44] cover.
[00:35:45] These seemed like jack hammer slamming into the aircraft.
[00:35:49] Beginning in the rear, working up the side and then into the cockpit.
[00:35:53] The tail rotor was shot off and the engine was shot up.
[00:35:57] Every system on the helicopter was damaged in some way.
[00:36:00] Throughout the tail rotor, the aircraft began to spin.
[00:36:03] Fuel lines were upshared and we were burning.
[00:36:05] I keyed the microphone.
[00:36:07] This is three-six taking fire from four o'clock, taking fire everywhere, taking fire, taking
[00:36:12] hits, going down, panther going down.
[00:36:15] The engine quit.
[00:36:16] The rotor RPM caution light flashed.
[00:36:19] The audio warning sounded announcing that my rotor blades were turning dangerously slow.
[00:36:24] I slammed the collective down hard to auto rotate.
[00:36:27] Under optimal conditions, this is a controlled emergency descent.
[00:36:31] Under these conditions, I could only hope to lessen the severity of the crash.
[00:36:36] We corkscrewed down flames.
[00:36:39] As I wrestled the aircraft, I radiowed my wingman flame.
[00:36:43] You better get in here and get us out quick.
[00:36:47] There was no answer.
[00:36:49] They were fighting for their lives.
[00:36:51] I learned years later that when I called, taking hits, flame had banked his co-brand fired
[00:36:56] rockets onto the position shooting at me.
[00:36:59] As he did so, a big ugly 51 round came through the cockpit and torrent to his chest, high
[00:37:05] on the left side.
[00:37:06] Bob took the controls and headed for help, flying from the front seat.
[00:37:10] My cobra came down spinning and burning.
[00:37:13] It hit the ground hard, nose low on the left side.
[00:37:17] It bounced back into the air, spun another turn and a half, and crashed.
[00:37:22] It settled nearly up right firing Gulf the cockpit.
[00:37:36] So pilots are known for maintaining their composure, right?
[00:37:43] I've heard pilots do it.
[00:37:45] And clearly, you know, you're saying we're taking hits, we're taking fire from everywhere.
[00:37:50] We're going down, Panther going down.
[00:37:53] Are you so tracking on control on the aircraft that you're just completely focused on
[00:37:59] that, that the rest of what's happening is a little bit blocked out or what are you
[00:38:07] think of yourself?
[00:38:08] I got to survive this crash.
[00:38:09] Are you not worried about the fact that when you get on the ground, hey, now I'm
[00:38:13] going to be surrounded by enemy?
[00:38:15] Yeah, none of those thoughts are taking place.
[00:38:19] As I said in an earlier thing that you read, everyone who's not totally insane is scared
[00:38:25] in combat.
[00:38:27] Oftentimes that fear comes about after the missions are over at the end of the day when
[00:38:30] you think back on what you'd been through that day.
[00:38:32] I think goodness, we got to drink alcohol and Vietnam.
[00:38:35] I don't know how people survive in war today.
[00:38:37] I really don't.
[00:38:38] We got drunk every single night and then went back out the next day and then did it again.
[00:38:41] So there's fear at the end of the day.
[00:38:43] There's also fear and trepidation to a degree when you first go and like when I describe
[00:38:49] coming across the hell and seeing what that battle of ban hat looked like, tracer stuff
[00:38:52] all over the place.
[00:38:53] You get butterflies in your stomach and your anxious.
[00:38:57] Once you go in on that mission and start those gun runs, there's no time, there's no mental
[00:39:04] space for any of that other thought.
[00:39:06] There's no mental space for that fear.
[00:39:09] You just focus on what you have to do and you do it and the whole thing we just read
[00:39:14] it and shot down, though still, I mean all these years later, I'm sitting here with a red
[00:39:18] emotional flush in my face, reliving this yet one more time.
[00:39:22] But no, I don't recall thinking of anything in those moments.
[00:39:26] But doing that mission, controlling that aircraft, dealing with that emergency situation
[00:39:31] is best I could and going through the whole process, I don't even think there was a thought
[00:39:34] of life or death or am I going to make it or not make it.
[00:39:37] None of that was even there.
[00:39:39] You do what you have to do and get it done and then when it all settled in and hit
[00:39:46] spun, settled in, crashed, smoke and flames everywhere, the thing begins exploding, then
[00:39:52] even then there's not time for that fear factor then because then you start dealing with,
[00:39:57] okay, what do I have to do now to survive this and get out of here?
[00:40:00] And so your aircrafts on fire and I guess you're not sitting around pondering much when
[00:40:04] your aircrafts on fire and you're stuck and they're trying to get out, you get hung up
[00:40:08] while you're getting out by the way.
[00:40:13] So you, you do get out, you make it away from the bird a little bit and you end up getting
[00:40:26] some distance away.
[00:40:27] You lost your wingman, right?
[00:40:29] Or you started, you lost your, you know, my wingman took the 51.
[00:40:32] But Tim, he got out of the aircraft too and took off in another direction.
[00:40:38] Now my front seat, Tim Connery, in a cobra there's two canopies, one for the front
[00:40:42] seat, one for the back.
[00:40:43] The front seat canopy opens to the left, the back seat canopy opens to the right.
[00:40:48] So we hit, we had an inner calm conversation, I said, I said, let's get out of this thing.
[00:40:55] That's good enough for that.
[00:40:57] And he robs at that call and then he got out his way I get out my way.
[00:41:02] I don't know if you had that little vignette of what happened when I was hanging upside
[00:41:05] down out the aircraft.
[00:41:06] Yeah, I did.
[00:41:07] I was doing one, two.
[00:41:09] Mark true hand, the idea of the visor on the ground there.
[00:41:12] I'll go ahead and if you want.
[00:41:14] Yeah, inside Ben hat, one of the American advisors Mark true hand, watch us get shot down
[00:41:18] in crash.
[00:41:19] He saw Tim exit the aircraft.
[00:41:21] He saw me hanging out of the side of the cobra, head down with my feet stuck in the
[00:41:25] cockpit, the helicopter burning.
[00:41:27] He'd seen a truck driver die in agony in a blazing semi-reck years before and it sworn
[00:41:33] he would not let that happen again.
[00:41:36] He raised the sight of his M16 rifle to my body.
[00:41:40] As he began to squeeze the trigger to put me out of my misery, a cloud of smoke billed
[00:41:45] from the exploding aircraft.
[00:41:47] It obscured me from his view.
[00:41:50] When the smoke cleared, I was gone.
[00:41:54] And that's something that you found out years later.
[00:41:56] Yeah, he got touched when I got a contact me and said, I think it was a letter.
[00:42:02] And said, I was one of the advisors on the ground at Ben hat when he got shot down.
[00:42:05] I can give you some information about what happened if you'd like to hear it.
[00:42:08] If you don't, I understand if you just don't want to even go there.
[00:42:11] I said, I'll tell me what you know.
[00:42:12] So he shared that story with me.
[00:42:14] Unbelievable.
[00:42:17] So I'm going back to the book.
[00:42:19] Your, your, this is the state you're in.
[00:42:21] The pain in my back was intense.
[00:42:23] It was broken.
[00:42:25] The fire had burned the back of my neck.
[00:42:26] I had lesser burns on my face.
[00:42:28] My hair was cinched.
[00:42:30] I had pulled a shell fragment out of my ankle.
[00:42:33] Superfistle.
[00:42:34] Last of the racians covered my face and forehead.
[00:42:36] But bleeding badly.
[00:42:39] I was a mess.
[00:42:40] But I was motivated.
[00:42:42] I wanted to get away.
[00:42:43] I staggered from the crash site and headed southeast towards quantum.
[00:42:47] Quantum.
[00:42:48] Quantum.
[00:42:49] As it was getting dark.
[00:42:50] I had not gone far when I heard helicopters approaching.
[00:42:54] The helicopters came in low shooting.
[00:42:57] And you had your little, uh, strobe.
[00:42:59] And so here we go.
[00:43:00] I held the light over my head pointed toward the aircraft.
[00:43:03] It flashed a few times.
[00:43:05] The gunner and the lead cobra opened up on me with his minigun.
[00:43:08] A stream of tracers came right at me, which is, this is something we learned in Iraq as
[00:43:14] well.
[00:43:15] When you fire off a strobe, if someone isn't expecting or isn't looking for it, it just
[00:43:19] looks like muscle flash and anybody that sees it will shoot at it.
[00:43:24] We had blue covers that we put on and it supposedly changed the color of it.
[00:43:28] So it wouldn't look like enemy fire.
[00:43:29] But no.
[00:43:30] In fact, I ran into that front seat or they're open up on me years later, Bentley Hill.
[00:43:34] And yeah, he's sure he said, yeah, we were out there flying that mission.
[00:43:37] It sure looked like enemy fire.
[00:43:38] Sorry about that.
[00:43:39] So here we go back to the book.
[00:43:46] This is a little bit about your attitude.
[00:43:47] I was coxer.
[00:43:48] If anyone could survive this, it was me.
[00:43:50] I'd been a boy scout.
[00:43:52] Though I was one of the trouble makers in my troop, I'd learned a lot.
[00:43:56] I'd backpack 65 miles through the mountains in five days in practice survival skills.
[00:44:01] My troubled youth got me suspended from school a number of times, but it also taught me
[00:44:05] lessons.
[00:44:06] I learned a street fight.
[00:44:08] Take care of myself.
[00:44:09] I had boxed, played football, and run track.
[00:44:12] I majored in forestry, worked cattle ranches, road Bronx, in small rodeos, fought forest
[00:44:19] fires, worked construction, and was an electrical lineman for Southern California Edison.
[00:44:26] I remembered a little, diddy my mother had taught me.
[00:44:29] The Lord helps those who help themselves.
[00:44:33] I knew I could depend on its absolute truth to get me through this.
[00:44:37] The Lord helps those who help themselves.
[00:44:40] God, I'll do that.
[00:44:41] Do all I can.
[00:44:43] Mustard every bit of what's inside me.
[00:44:45] I'll do my part.
[00:44:47] I'll do all I can to help myself.
[00:44:50] So please, please do yours.
[00:44:53] I need your help.
[00:44:55] I set it again to myself, drawing comfort and strength.
[00:44:59] The Lord helps those who help themselves.
[00:45:02] I would repeat it often, as I set my mind to doing all I must to survive.
[00:45:12] This is interesting going through this and all this detail again, because when I wrote
[00:45:22] the book, I had to revisit everything in detail, like I had not done since it happened to
[00:45:27] me.
[00:45:28] I had never gone to this depth of reliving those experiences.
[00:45:32] It's tough to think back on that.
[00:45:37] Indeed when I was writing this, I'd share some of the writing with my wife on account
[00:45:41] to bed late at night and after I got a few chapters into this, I told her, when I said,
[00:45:45] I'm only what am I doing?
[00:45:46] This whole thing is a series of unfortunate events who's going to want to read something
[00:45:50] like this.
[00:45:51] And she told me, I know the whole story.
[00:45:53] She said, stick with it, finish this book because I think that in it there is inspiration,
[00:45:59] there's motivation for people.
[00:46:00] It's not just your story.
[00:46:02] It can help others.
[00:46:05] And so in that vein, I say that because it is getting a little emotional as we read through
[00:46:10] this and that's fine.
[00:46:11] But I do hope that some of this is useful and helpful for others.
[00:46:16] And I grew up going to church as a kid, but I wasn't overly religious guy and somewhere
[00:46:23] around college, I quit going to church altogether.
[00:46:26] And in the army, the only time I can remember that I'd been going to church was from Memorial
[00:46:29] Services for guys and that was about it.
[00:46:32] But if you end up in a situation like this, or I would say any, really, if you think the
[00:46:38] situation in your life is stressful and is about to overwhelm you, you need some help
[00:46:42] beyond yourself.
[00:46:44] And no matter what you're not selling any religion, but I would say whatever your religious
[00:46:49] beliefs are, you can find a lot of strength in your God and get close to God and he'll
[00:46:56] help you through it.
[00:46:57] And certainly I couldn't have done this by myself.
[00:47:00] I grabbed a whole of that ditty that my mom gave me.
[00:47:02] I also grabbed a whole to the 23rd Psalm and when stuff got really close to being blown
[00:47:07] to smithereens a few times later on in my captivity, that 23rd Psalm was going over and
[00:47:11] over again in my mind too.
[00:47:13] So yeah, again, not selling any religion, but whatever your spirituality is, you'd best
[00:47:17] get comfortable with it if you're going to be in dire straits like this.
[00:47:21] And it's interesting that you're saying, look, I'm going to do everything I can, but
[00:47:28] I'm needs help.
[00:47:29] Yep.
[00:47:30] Yep.
[00:47:31] And you know, certainly, you know, when you say that other people, you know, will
[00:47:36] be able to find absolutely, I mean, just me reading this, I found all kinds of not just
[00:47:41] inspiration, but practical guidance, which, you know, one of the things you just said is
[00:47:46] practical guidance on, you know, someone that's been through what you've been through, there's
[00:47:50] so much that everybody else can take away and learn from.
[00:47:54] And yeah, that's, that's one of them right there.
[00:47:59] Do what you can, do everything that you can, and then have some faith on the things that
[00:48:05] you can't control are going to work out your way.
[00:48:07] Yeah, and I think that's important too, because I'm thinking now as we're talking, and I don't
[00:48:10] know if we're going to get to that specific part in the book or not.
[00:48:14] But early on, I think it was the first night, I get B52 strikes almost landing on top
[00:48:18] of me.
[00:48:19] And I'm beginning to feel that am I going to survive this or not?
[00:48:23] And I think the answer is, I don't know, but in that answer is, I don't know.
[00:48:29] And so what?
[00:48:30] I mean, that doesn't matter.
[00:48:31] That's not important.
[00:48:32] I may survive.
[00:48:33] If I'm going to do all I can to survive.
[00:48:35] So I got to the point where this fear of being blown to smithereens kind of went away.
[00:48:42] And I just settled into, I'll either survive or I won't survive.
[00:48:46] But I can't worry about that.
[00:48:47] All I can worry about is what can I do to try and set the best conditions to make that
[00:48:52] survival possible?
[00:48:53] And if I either will or I won't.
[00:48:56] You know, one of the similar things that I always felt was, you know, when I rack
[00:49:00] one of the biggest threats to us was IEDs and they're random.
[00:49:08] They're going to hit you or they're not going to hit you.
[00:49:11] And when you every time you go outside the wire, there's a chance that it's your day.
[00:49:17] And you know, kind of what I told my guys and the way I felt myself was, okay, I know
[00:49:23] they're out there.
[00:49:24] We've done everything we can to mitigate the risk.
[00:49:26] We've done our planning.
[00:49:27] We've done our drills. We've gathered our intelligence. There's nothing else we can do
[00:49:32] to control it. So I'm not going to worry about it.
[00:49:34] Right. And I've done everything I can.
[00:49:36] But like you said, I've helped myself as much as I can.
[00:49:40] And then after that, it's out of my hands.
[00:49:42] And in the more you worry about it, like you said, well, does it really matter?
[00:49:47] I continue to worry about it.
[00:49:48] But doesn't matter.
[00:49:50] Got it.
[00:49:50] Got to move forward.
[00:49:51] Exactly.
[00:49:52] Here's, you do a couple days, three days worth of a vision of the enemy.
[00:50:01] And now you're out hiding.
[00:50:05] You hear some voices.
[00:50:07] You crouch down.
[00:50:07] You're hiding.
[00:50:08] You know there are people.
[00:50:10] And here we go back to the book.
[00:50:11] A lot of crashing around came from the direction of the voices.
[00:50:14] I looked up and saw uniformed NVA soldiers pointing AK47 rifles at my head.
[00:50:20] They shriek something in motion for me to stand up.
[00:50:23] I did.
[00:50:24] I was captured.
[00:50:26] I felt indescribably sick in the pit of my stomach as the world fell away.
[00:50:32] I'd been struggling for three days to stay alive.
[00:50:35] I was in miserable shape.
[00:50:37] But I had been free.
[00:50:39] And I had options.
[00:50:41] No more.
[00:50:42] My soul was awashed with anguish.
[00:50:45] I was no longer a free man.
[00:50:47] In that instant, I'd become a captive of the communist North Vietnamese Army, a prisoner
[00:50:52] of war, another American POW, and the long Vietnam conflict.
[00:50:58] I had no idea how long they might let me live.
[00:51:02] Or, if I was about to die.
[00:51:09] A couple of them were shaking.
[00:51:11] We stood in utter silence for a moment.
[00:51:13] They glared at me.
[00:51:14] I glared at them.
[00:51:15] So that tense instant, I didn't know if I'd be riddled with bullets or be allowed
[00:51:20] to live.
[00:51:21] One barked something at me I could not understand.
[00:51:23] Another joined in, then a third, I looked right into their eyes.
[00:51:28] I was an American.
[00:51:29] I would show them the best American fighting man that I could.
[00:51:39] In the pit of full state that I was in, you know, that's the best I could do on
[00:51:44] describing capture.
[00:51:46] It's impossible to really convey the full feeling of losing your freedom and being
[00:51:52] a captive.
[00:51:53] It's just indescribable.
[00:51:55] But I did the best that I could.
[00:51:58] I was in miserable shape.
[00:51:59] I mean, you read about the wounds that I had.
[00:52:01] In addition to those, I'd picked up some leeches that I'd been plucking off on my body.
[00:52:08] My face was covered with blood.
[00:52:10] My three-day growth, the heavy beard was sticking through.
[00:52:13] This is my back injuries that I didn't even know that I got released and I had badly broken
[00:52:17] my back.
[00:52:18] I had no control of my bowels or bladder for those three days.
[00:52:21] I smelled, I was just an awful mess when those guys captured me and took me up that hill.
[00:52:31] They finally get you to sort of like a camp, sort of the first interrogation camp.
[00:52:37] Yeah, well, they captured me the jungle.
[00:52:40] So thick, they were only a few yards away when I stumbled upon them and they had been
[00:52:45] down to the stream, filling canteens.
[00:52:47] These five young guys captured me.
[00:52:49] They took me almost an equal distance up a hill opposite and I came into an open area.
[00:52:54] Still had the canopy of the triple canopy jungle.
[00:52:57] But the bottom was all open.
[00:52:58] There are hundreds of North Vietnamese soldiers, supplies, defensive positions.
[00:53:02] This was a major staging area for this battle.
[00:53:04] It was taking place.
[00:53:05] As I was trying to get away from the battle and get towards cont too, my stumbled right
[00:53:10] into their staging area.
[00:53:13] And you start getting your, you know, start getting the soft interrogation is what I put
[00:53:19] down here.
[00:53:20] A guy says, you know, we found pictures of a pretty lady with your children in your wallet,
[00:53:25] obviously your family.
[00:53:28] And you say, yeah, I know you miss them and are very worried and they're very worried
[00:53:33] about you, you follow the rules and you will be home soon.
[00:53:36] You'll receive humane and lenient treatment.
[00:53:40] You will be allowed to go home.
[00:53:43] And I put that in there because that's a refrain that we hear quite a bit humane and lenient
[00:53:48] that was a refrain.
[00:53:50] They would say it all the time and during my whole captivity, you do what you're supposed
[00:53:54] to do and cooperate.
[00:53:55] You get the humane and lenient treatment.
[00:53:57] Of course, you weren't fully cooperative at all with them and what they were asking you.
[00:54:04] So they went from that idea.
[00:54:07] So they started stepping it up on you and you know, here's an example of the things that
[00:54:10] they said, you are a war criminal and the Geneva agreements do not apply to you.
[00:54:15] You have no rights, but we will still give you the deserved humane and lenient treatment.
[00:54:21] All you have to do is cooperate with us and acknowledge your crimes.
[00:54:25] Yep.
[00:54:26] You know, I think it was back to your reading of the Code of Conduct that started this
[00:54:30] off to our Code of Conduct was different.
[00:54:33] Right.
[00:54:34] It said we were bound to give only our name rank service number and data birth and the way
[00:54:40] that was taught and the way we understood it.
[00:54:41] That was all we could give was name rank service number, data birth and if we gave anything
[00:54:46] else we had we had caved in and we're cooperating with the enemy.
[00:54:51] So that was my stance that was all I was going to give them was my name rank service
[00:54:55] number, data birth.
[00:54:56] You may get into some of the things that took place.
[00:54:59] I would just like to comment that there was nothing heroic going on at all.
[00:55:03] I guess a couple of things that were going on.
[00:55:05] I was trying to abide by the Code of Conduct and I was in a state where I had been near
[00:55:10] death for days, was very near death at that moment and was numb and just almost didn't
[00:55:17] care.
[00:55:18] I was hard to understand and believe but almost didn't care at that point and then I got
[00:55:21] so angry and aggravated with this son of a bitch that ended up being my interrogator from
[00:55:26] his initial soft cell as you said but his first words he showed up he's only got
[00:55:31] spoken anglicence.
[00:55:32] I was captured so I asked myself myself, my condition if I was hurt and so I opened up
[00:55:37] with him about some of that but then when he got into what was clearly an interrogation
[00:55:41] then I clamped up.
[00:55:43] I would close these comments now with the fact that he didn't break me and that interrogation
[00:55:50] speaks nothing to my heroism or ability to resist interrogation anyone can be broken.
[00:55:57] If this would have continued over time I'm sure that he could have got me to do something
[00:56:03] with his brutality probably nothing that would have given him any useful intelligence but
[00:56:07] he might have got me to do something.
[00:56:10] So for that for those moments on those days of that initial interrogation I was able
[00:56:15] to stick with my name rank service number data worth.
[00:56:19] Here's an example of that is back the book here please sign this.
[00:56:27] He handed me one of the sheets of paper in a pen.
[00:56:29] I looked at the paper it was typed in English as I began to read the words my interrogator
[00:56:33] interrupted this is simply a form that acknowledges your status we need it so we can
[00:56:38] begin to process you for release so we can send word to your family of your status please
[00:56:43] just sign.
[00:56:44] I read the words I could not believe what I was reading.
[00:56:47] There was a blank face place for me to fill in my name.
[00:56:51] The text said that I was an American war criminal who had been conducting illegal
[00:56:55] acts against the Vietnamese people including bioside genocide and eco-side.
[00:57:01] I had dropped fire bombs and chemical bombs.
[00:57:03] I had killed old men, pregnant women and babies.
[00:57:07] Bioside genocide, eco-side, what a bunch of crap.
[00:57:12] I raised my head and looked into his eyes.
[00:57:14] And no, I will not sign this.
[00:57:18] There I had spoken, you must.
[00:57:20] I will not.
[00:57:22] His agitation returned now, you must.
[00:57:24] I glared at him.
[00:57:26] He got up and came at me.
[00:57:27] He smacked me across the face.
[00:57:29] You must.
[00:57:30] He turned to his sidekick and spoke quietly and the man got up.
[00:57:35] At his direction two guards dragged me up against a tree, a broad trunk of a tree.
[00:57:40] I've been bent over since the crash unable to stand erect.
[00:57:44] He forced me up and to a straight sitting position and tied me to the tree.
[00:57:48] It hurt like hell.
[00:57:49] I couldn't keep my face from contorting in anguish.
[00:57:52] Now you sign.
[00:57:54] No.
[00:57:56] More orders.
[00:57:57] They pulled on the ropes to bring my arms closer together behind me.
[00:58:00] The pain in my back increased.
[00:58:03] New pain was introduced in my shoulder joints.
[00:58:06] More demands to sign.
[00:58:07] More refusals.
[00:58:09] The ropes tightened further.
[00:58:11] They moved my elbows closer together.
[00:58:13] More demands.
[00:58:14] More refusals.
[00:58:15] ropes ever tighter.
[00:58:16] More pain.
[00:58:18] I was uncontrollably grimacing and cursing.
[00:58:22] I would not sign.
[00:58:24] I could never consider signing anything like that.
[00:58:28] The brutality made me angrier and more firmly set against giving in.
[00:58:33] I could have been broken and made to sign eventually.
[00:58:36] There's no doubt.
[00:58:37] No man can resist forever.
[00:58:39] But this interrogator would not bring me to breaking point on that day.
[00:58:45] His demands continued and so did my refusals.
[00:58:49] The ropes tightened more and more.
[00:58:51] Pain screamed through me.
[00:58:52] My anger swelled against this asshole.
[00:58:55] I began grunting and audible attack against the agony.
[00:58:59] The guards gave the ropes one huge last pull which brought my elbows together behind me.
[00:59:05] I felt the pop as each shoulder dislocated.
[00:59:08] I leaned my knee and shot through my torso up my neck into my head and down my back through
[00:59:14] my groin and into my thighs.
[00:59:17] I've never felt such pain.
[00:59:19] My vision narrowed and I nearly passed out.
[00:59:23] Sign.
[00:59:25] I could only groan and shake my head.
[00:59:28] The interrogator scald angrily turned and left.
[00:59:39] I'm going to continue on.
[00:59:45] This is a little bit further on.
[00:59:49] He's given you one last chance to sign this paper.
[00:59:57] One last chance to cooperate.
[00:59:59] Will you?
[01:00:00] I'm going back to the book now.
[01:00:02] My head hung down partly in exhaustion and partly in an intentional rudeness, not paying
[01:00:06] in him any attention.
[01:00:08] I looked up when he finished.
[01:00:09] I saw his sadistic minion standing a few yards in front of me holding an AK-47 at the
[01:00:14] ready.
[01:00:15] Your last chance.
[01:00:19] The assistant raised the rifle and pointed at me.
[01:00:22] I stared ahead and said nothing.
[01:00:25] No heroism was involved.
[01:00:28] I was wrung out at the end of everything I had to give.
[01:00:32] I'd been so close to death for so long, was so angry and so absolutely drained.
[01:00:39] A faint spark was all I had left.
[01:00:42] I felt numb, detached from what was happening.
[01:00:46] I was not resisting.
[01:00:47] I was just giving into the flow of whatever was destined to be.
[01:00:52] That might be death.
[01:00:54] It might not.
[01:00:56] I'd seen army training film and army training film years before showing the mock execution
[01:01:01] of a Korean war, POW.
[01:01:04] I remembered that scene.
[01:01:05] The action of the trigger being pulled when over and over in my mind.
[01:01:08] Click, click, click.
[01:01:11] BAN!
[01:01:12] I flinched as a soldier jerked the trigger back, but nothing happened.
[01:01:17] No shot.
[01:01:18] No loud bang.
[01:01:20] No bullet ripping my skull or chest.
[01:01:23] Nothing.
[01:01:25] The soldier laughed.
[01:01:27] My interrogator smiled.
[01:01:30] I am done with you.
[01:01:32] You will be taken away from here.
[01:01:35] That was three days of this three horrible days.
[01:01:42] Losing my freedom, going through that interrogation, being thrown down into a pit at
[01:01:49] night where I stayed, it was one of the old abandoned bunkers who had about six inches of mud
[01:01:54] and goo in the bottom.
[01:01:58] That caused me a big psychological issue.
[01:02:00] First night closed in that darkness that night I really had to fight to just keep my
[01:02:05] cool down there.
[01:02:06] I went to a bunch of there.
[01:02:08] There were sent upheats and spiders and rats.
[01:02:11] It was a mess.
[01:02:12] I'd spend the night down there and come up in the daytime for interrogation back down
[01:02:15] in that hole.
[01:02:16] Night back up for interrogation.
[01:02:18] What we read covered a period of three days before we finally gave up on me.
[01:02:23] I had no idea what was going to happen.
[01:02:26] I just had even thinking back on it.
[01:02:27] It was just going through all that pretty much in just a numb state with that treatment.
[01:02:36] My shoulders today still caused me problems.
[01:02:38] I had a son that ended up playing football for University of Washington many years ago.
[01:02:41] He's going to turn 50 years in April.
[01:02:44] This was a number of years ago.
[01:02:46] I used to go like I'd throw about two passes and that was it for my shoulders.
[01:02:49] Can't play horses or anything.
[01:02:53] Yeah.
[01:02:54] It's something that definitely I've experienced doing these readings.
[01:03:03] I've talked about it before that when I read something in my head and it kind of
[01:03:08] I go all the way, that's powerful.
[01:03:11] Then when you read it aloud and you hear it, it's just, it's a
[01:03:15] even more.
[01:03:16] It's the same thing with I know I sent you Jody Middix, the podcast with Jody Middix.
[01:03:21] He said the same thing.
[01:03:23] He said to me, when you're reading it, it's like I'm hearing my own thoughts or something.
[01:03:31] It just brought him back.
[01:03:35] There's something about that.
[01:03:37] It's okay.
[01:03:38] When you're reading it, it's detached from reality.
[01:03:43] It's one step further detached from reality and obviously sitting with Jody sitting
[01:03:48] here with you and knowing that this is you.
[01:03:52] One point that I make all the time when I cover these historical books, I always remind
[01:03:57] people that because people in this day and age were used to seeing movies.
[01:04:01] We're used to seeing watching TV.
[01:04:03] And I always say that this guy that I'm talking about, this is a person.
[01:04:06] This guy in World War II, this is a person.
[01:04:08] This guy in World War I, this is a man.
[01:04:12] So to have you sitting here knowing that this is you.
[01:04:17] It's, I don't even know what that's stated describe it.
[01:04:22] Well, thanks, Jocco.
[01:04:23] And this has become an emotional experience for me, but it's important.
[01:04:28] And I think this is going to be an important podcast.
[01:04:31] I wrote that book.
[01:04:32] I finished it.
[01:04:33] It was published last April.
[01:04:36] I'm not read that book since it was published.
[01:04:39] I mean, it was something to go through and we live all that to get it written.
[01:04:44] And so it's been almost a year.
[01:04:46] I haven't read the book.
[01:04:47] So we're going into, into, into detail.
[01:04:50] But this is, this is good.
[01:04:56] So you get turned over to some other, some other guards.
[01:05:02] Right.
[01:05:03] And they start taking you, don't walk.
[01:05:05] Yeah, you're walking.
[01:05:07] It's just somewhere else.
[01:05:10] You talked about the conditioning.
[01:05:11] By the way, you have a broken cross vertebra at this point, right?
[01:05:14] Yeah, it's a badly broken back.
[01:05:16] One vertebra is about completely gross damage to two other vertebra.
[01:05:19] Your legs swollen.
[01:05:20] You got all kinds of you.
[01:05:21] And now you're now you got to walk.
[01:05:23] And so I'm going to go with, yeah, they gave me my boots back after those three days
[01:05:27] of interrogation.
[01:05:28] No socks, no laces, boots, bare feet.
[01:05:31] Okay, go ahead.
[01:05:33] We had an old Vietnam seal when I got to see old T-1 in 1990 and he would run barefoot all
[01:05:39] the time.
[01:05:41] And, you know, one day was, hey, hey sir, why are you, you know, why are you run barefoot?
[01:05:47] And he says, the first thing that it goes to, take your shoes, got to have hard feet.
[01:05:51] I was like, okay, okay, so I'm running barefoot now.
[01:05:53] I was thinking, because when I showed up at C-1, I always joke about this, I thought
[01:05:59] I was going to the Vietnam War in 1991 when I got there.
[01:06:01] I thought, I'm going to Vietnam now.
[01:06:03] You know, I was that, how you were, but I was a little off, you know, historically.
[01:06:09] So that's the situation you're going back to the book.
[01:06:12] They've been saying a phrase, so as you're marching with these guys, they've been saying
[01:06:14] a phrase for the past two days that I couldn't understand.
[01:06:16] I thought it was Vietnamese.
[01:06:19] Gokkukadai.
[01:06:21] As we pushed up the road, they walked behind me poking the rifle barrels into my kidneys,
[01:06:27] my ribs, shouting with increasing urgency.
[01:06:30] Gokkukadai.
[01:06:31] Gokkukadai.
[01:06:33] Then after a while, for the first time, I understood what they were saying.
[01:06:37] Gokkuk or Dai.
[01:06:39] They had been taught one short phrase in English.
[01:06:42] It was all they knew, and they had pronounced it so poorly that it took me two days to
[01:06:46] figure it out.
[01:06:48] I moved as fast as I could, but I was at the end of everything I had.
[01:06:52] I struggled on.
[01:06:53] And you know, I'm just noticing this.
[01:06:58] You're going to reach the end of everything you had.
[01:07:00] You already were there.
[01:07:02] Many times.
[01:07:03] Reach the end.
[01:07:04] You just reached it.
[01:07:05] It's incredible.
[01:07:07] That's an amazing thing about human beings.
[01:07:10] We have inside that we can dig down and grab a hold of when we have to, that we don't
[01:07:15] think we ever could have done it.
[01:07:17] It's there.
[01:07:18] Can hear something that helped you.
[01:07:21] Back to the book, I found myself mentally reciting what I could recall of the 23rd
[01:07:26] Psalm.
[01:07:27] I repeated one line over and over in my head.
[01:07:31] Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for
[01:07:37] that I won't with me.
[01:07:40] That wasn't the only time during my captivity that the 23rd Psalm came to my lips.
[01:07:46] Nope.
[01:07:54] And please forgive me for like I already covered three days of misery.
[01:08:02] Now we're talking about, and I'm doing it in three minutes.
[01:08:07] Now you've walked for multiple days, suffering the whole time, and I'm going to fast forward
[01:08:12] through it.
[01:08:13] And I'm sorry.
[01:08:15] And that's why people didn't agree with us.
[01:08:18] But I didn't agree with you.
[01:08:20] That's all there.
[01:08:21] So you arrive at a camp now.
[01:08:23] You arrived back to the book.
[01:08:25] We stopped in front of one cage in the door opened.
[01:08:27] A guard pushed me in and I stumbled over someone lying inside and fell, tumbling into
[01:08:31] the ground, pain shot through me.
[01:08:34] The cage was about 12 feet wide and 20 feet or so long.
[01:08:40] It could not have been more than four feet high.
[01:08:42] 26 prisoners were stuffed inside all South Vietnamese soldiers.
[01:08:48] Heat hung in the cage, heavy and stale.
[01:08:50] The air smelled of filth and putrid wounds.
[01:08:53] People moaned in a constant dull rumble.
[01:08:56] The occasion of whale was met with sharp, shushes, and guard, guarded whispers.
[01:09:02] The doorway was shut and secured.
[01:09:04] I lay there.
[01:09:06] Thankful I'd survive the journey of the past three days.
[01:09:09] What would become of me now?
[01:09:12] Yeah, that was my first prison camp.
[01:09:18] The jungle camp was in the jungle.
[01:09:21] I figured somewhere northern Cambodia where the US was not pretty anymore.
[01:09:25] It was a camp of many cages, about 300 prisoners in that camp.
[01:09:30] All South Vietnamese, bit of encapsulated in this offensive.
[01:09:33] One other American who I would meet later and put one of those cages.
[01:09:40] Back to the book.
[01:09:41] My broken back screamed every time I tried to lay down.
[01:09:44] I tried to lie down with my feet in the stocks.
[01:09:47] So they'd put your feet into stocks, wooden bamboo stocks.
[01:09:51] There was no way I could lay on my side.
[01:09:54] I couldn't lay straight back so I sat upright in the dark in agony.
[01:09:59] I thought of my family, thought of my day of where I'd been, where I was now, and what
[01:10:04] my lie ahead.
[01:10:06] I heard badly.
[01:10:08] Still, I had hope.
[01:10:11] I can live this way.
[01:10:12] I can do this.
[01:10:13] I can survive.
[01:10:15] I will survive.
[01:10:16] I sat there, thoughts drifting across the landscape of my life, shaped by these extraordinary
[01:10:23] circumstances.
[01:10:25] Eventually, I fell asleep, sitting upright that night, dreaming of what might become
[01:10:30] of me.
[01:10:32] I jolted awake, something scampered across my legs, something was on my feet, something
[01:10:37] small, cool, and wet, touched my arches and soles.
[01:10:42] The rat knows his poke and sniffed at my feet, tiny teeth noded my pulverized raw flesh.
[01:10:50] My arms swung without command as I batted, a large rat off my lap.
[01:10:56] Others scurried away, I screamed inside, lips pressed tightly shut, a muffled shriek of
[01:11:01] terror.
[01:11:03] I thrashed, my legs flailed, but went nowhere.
[01:11:06] I wiggled my feet as well as I could in the socks and got the rats off.
[01:11:11] They fled into the night only to return when I fell back asleep.
[01:11:15] They would return to torment me nearly every night in that jungle prison.
[01:11:23] I don't like rats this day.
[01:11:27] Some of my kids just mess with me and just bring up rats.
[01:11:29] I hate rats from that experience and that's not the beginning or the end of the rat
[01:11:35] experiences and prison.
[01:11:39] One thing that you did mention though that I liked it to highlight is hope.
[01:11:44] There was a phrase in there that I wasn't going to give up hope.
[01:11:47] Hope is such a powerful thing.
[01:11:50] It's there for all of us.
[01:11:52] We just need to grab a hold of it and hold it tightly.
[01:11:57] Hope was all I had for much of my time and captivity.
[01:12:02] Hope of surviving and in that survival of getting back to my two young kids, those two
[01:12:09] kids really played such a role in having me survive.
[01:12:14] My son when I went over there was four and a half years old, a little over four.
[01:12:18] My daughter was newborn, but when things get really really tough, I think of those kids
[01:12:23] and how about it was, I had to endure it to do my best to survive and get home to those
[01:12:29] kids.
[01:12:30] Yeah, I definitely, that's one of the things that I specifically highlighted.
[01:12:38] You know, I can live this way.
[01:12:39] I can do this.
[01:12:41] I can survive.
[01:12:42] I will survive.
[01:12:45] I still, I had hope and I read it just the way you just explained it hit me that hard.
[01:12:56] Back to the book.
[01:12:57] We sat for a few more hours.
[01:13:02] A pair of rag tag crew, almost everyone had been wounded, some gravely.
[01:13:07] Fulf covered their tattered uniforms.
[01:13:09] The whole place, stunk of sweat, blood, infection, feces and urine.
[01:13:14] We were all hurting and some would die.
[01:13:16] Some consciously whispered to their neighbor, most like me, just sat and stared.
[01:13:22] That's what I did.
[01:13:23] I sat and stared at them, sitting and staring at nothing.
[01:13:27] I wondered if I would go crazy here, would I die here?
[01:13:30] What would happen first?
[01:13:32] Insanity or death?
[01:13:34] I snapped back to what little grass I had on reality, hold it together.
[01:13:40] Focus.
[01:13:41] Spence and Vicki.
[01:13:43] We'll hike.
[01:13:44] We'll play.
[01:13:45] Get back home for those kids.
[01:13:46] You can do it.
[01:13:47] You can endure.
[01:13:50] I couldn't allow my thoughts to drift in dark directions.
[01:13:53] I forced myself into logical, structured thinking.
[01:13:59] I began planning a hiking trip with my family, a backtrip, backing trip into the woods.
[01:14:04] I planned the route.
[01:14:05] The equipment loads for each.
[01:14:07] They'd be feather light for Vicki, a little more for Spence and Amy.
[01:14:11] I'd carry most of it.
[01:14:12] We'd eat dehydrated food, cooked around a small campfire.
[01:14:17] Delicious.
[01:14:20] I'll tell you, dehydrated food then sounded awfully, awfully.
[01:14:24] That was a gourmet meal.
[01:14:28] I did that.
[01:14:30] I got back from my captivity.
[01:14:31] I spent some men maybe going to this later.
[01:14:33] I won't get all the details of hospitalization and medical on all that.
[01:14:36] But when I got released from the hospital, finally took my family on vacation and he guesses
[01:14:43] on what the first thing I did on that vacation.
[01:14:45] Tell me.
[01:14:47] I drove to the Olympic Peninsula and took my family backpacking.
[01:14:51] You're a hard man.
[01:14:52] You're the Olympic Peninsula.
[01:14:54] I love.
[01:14:55] I'm glad that I did.
[01:14:56] I always enjoyed the wilderness in the woods.
[01:14:59] I would have been a much worse shape and captivity if I hadn't.
[01:15:03] But since then, I've loved the wilderness and the woods even more.
[01:15:06] I love every day, every beautiful day on God's screen, Earth.
[01:15:10] I love the wilderness and the woods.
[01:15:11] We were signed a Panama for a time on it.
[01:15:13] I've been dancing for Jumelsville.
[01:15:15] One thing my older son, the little four and a half year old boy, was an adult by then.
[01:15:21] We backpacked.
[01:15:22] We did a three-day journey across the Espezapana.
[01:15:25] Somewhere where nobody ever did.
[01:15:26] We just picked some place from the Atlantic side or the Pacific side.
[01:15:30] We did mountain bikes first.
[01:15:31] Then we backpacked, staying in the jungle.
[01:15:33] Until we got to the Rio Indio.
[01:15:35] It was dry season.
[01:15:36] We didn't plan it very well because we had to hike way down the Rio Indio before there
[01:15:40] was enough water to hire a guy at a Cayuga canoe to take us out to the ocean.
[01:15:44] That was just before my retirement.
[01:15:47] I've always loved the wilderness, loved the jungle.
[01:15:50] I don't know how we got on that thing.
[01:15:51] Back to the book.
[01:15:52] That's awesome.
[01:15:53] One of the things that I, again, I specifically highlighted was the fact that you would be
[01:16:01] drifting in these dark directions and you would force yourself.
[01:16:05] I talk about that too.
[01:16:07] I say mind control.
[01:16:08] Not mind control like, hey, we're going to control your mind.
[01:16:10] Control your own mind.
[01:16:12] Put your own thoughts in there.
[01:16:13] You can do that.
[01:16:14] People just need to learn how to do it and said, well, you start drifting off in the wrong
[01:16:17] direction.
[01:16:18] Control your thoughts.
[01:16:20] Get mind control.
[01:16:21] I love the fact that you did that.
[01:16:23] We such with such authority and power over what your brain was thinking.
[01:16:29] Yeah, I think that's an important message.
[01:16:31] I was a much overused phrase.
[01:16:33] You have glass half empty or glass half full kind of guy.
[01:16:38] I really would advocate for you have to be a glass half full kind of guy to survive.
[01:16:45] And I think I might carry the argument further.
[01:16:47] If you want to have a happy full enjoyable life, you'd damn well better be a half glass
[01:16:50] full kind of person.
[01:16:52] If you're, I mean, there's enough problems and difficulties in life.
[01:16:55] If you want to go for the dark side, it's there.
[01:16:58] You can go to it.
[01:17:00] But there's enough positive, wonderful things.
[01:17:03] The, yeah, grab that beat of hope and go for it.
[01:17:06] Absolutely.
[01:17:07] Back into the camp, back into the book, the camp provided a miserable existence on the edge
[01:17:13] of madness.
[01:17:15] All was filth and disease and suffering.
[01:17:19] Moans and whales of pain and anguish cried from the enclosures as we walked by.
[01:17:23] I caught glimpses of sick and wounded men inside cage after cage.
[01:17:27] Their eyes, white orbs of desperation, peering from grimy faces through the den of the
[01:17:33] gray world inside.
[01:17:35] And now you're back in the stocks sitting there wounded in stocks in a bamboo cage and an
[01:17:44] unknown jungle prison camp with death all around me.
[01:17:47] I began to wonder how long can I endure this?
[01:17:51] Then my voice said out loud as long as it takes.
[01:17:56] Incredible.
[01:18:00] And here you meet in this prison camp, you meet Wayne Wayne.
[01:18:08] Wayne Finch.
[01:18:09] Yeah, the other American who was ill-prosemite, he had been captured.
[01:18:13] March April, a couple months before me.
[01:18:17] And you, Wayne, the crew, now you're going to get put on a long march.
[01:18:23] They say we're going to move you out of this prison camp.
[01:18:25] Do you know you're going to hendoy at this moment?
[01:18:27] No, no.
[01:18:28] They pulled me out of my cage and I found myself in the center of the camp with a group
[01:18:32] of 25 South Vietnamese prisoners.
[01:18:36] I think they were all officers myself and Wayne.
[01:18:40] And they told us they were going to move us to a new camp.
[01:18:43] And the communist camp came in, it was running at the mouth and one of the South Vietnamese
[01:18:46] officers was translating for us.
[01:18:48] But they're going to move us to a new camp where conditions would be better.
[01:18:52] I mean, in this camp, people were dying almost every day.
[01:18:56] The conditions would be better.
[01:18:57] We'd get medical care, we'd get letters from home.
[01:19:00] But then we had very difficult journey.
[01:19:02] It could last for as long as 11 days.
[01:19:05] And we should try very hard to make it.
[01:19:08] That's what we were told.
[01:19:09] Now the private day is, I guess, was registering my mind.
[01:19:12] The private day hard to make it really didn't fully register until we actually set out marching.
[01:19:17] By this time, my ankle wound was very infected.
[01:19:20] My leg was very swollen.
[01:19:21] It was so painful just to take a step.
[01:19:24] And I was having to take step after step after step.
[01:19:27] And as I got into that march, I was wondering how I was going to get through the first
[01:19:31] day.
[01:19:32] I didn't think I could do it.
[01:19:33] I didn't know how I could possibly walk for a day through the jungle.
[01:19:37] They had us tied loosely together.
[01:19:39] Had our arms tied loose behind our backs.
[01:19:42] No shoes this time.
[01:19:43] This was barefoot.
[01:19:44] And off we went.
[01:19:46] Somehow I made it through that first day.
[01:19:48] And the day after that.
[01:19:50] And the day after that.
[01:19:52] The trip turned out to be not 11 days to a new camp somewhere in Cambodia or even louser
[01:19:57] back into Vietnam.
[01:19:59] That trip took over three months.
[01:20:02] And I did end up in Hanoi at the end of that trip.
[01:20:05] That journey cost the lives of six of the South Vietnamese prisoners in Wayne, the other
[01:20:13] American died before we got to Hanoi.
[01:20:16] And I damn near died a number of times.
[01:20:19] That's all in the book.
[01:20:21] The great Scott, I survived and made it and got all the way to Hanoi.
[01:20:28] He also got to know some of the Vietnamese soldiers.
[01:20:34] Some of them, one of them, lieutenant, Wayne, Dean, Zan.
[01:20:39] Is that right?
[01:20:40] That's very good.
[01:20:41] Zan, Zan, Zan.
[01:20:43] Zan.
[01:20:44] And he was, you know, obviously, you formed a really good relationship with him.
[01:20:49] Yes.
[01:20:50] Here we go back to the book.
[01:20:51] We tried to, let me interject one.
[01:20:53] Let me interject one thing because this is fascinating to me.
[01:20:57] It's always been.
[01:20:58] Well, I'll come back to it.
[01:21:00] Let me see where you're going to go with the conversation.
[01:21:02] You're going to get to my relationship with him and yeah.
[01:21:04] Okay.
[01:21:05] Yeah, absolutely.
[01:21:08] We tried it out of the valley up onto a rising ridge line.
[01:21:12] There wasn't much talking when we began to climb up the steep long trail.
[01:21:16] I was already exhausted.
[01:21:17] I had to push hard to make every step. my swollen infected ankle, fraught with pain.
[01:21:22] I wondered, is anyone else having this much trouble?
[01:21:25] How long am I be able to keep going?
[01:21:27] Only then did the words of the lead guard really hit me as long as 11 days try very hard
[01:21:34] to make it.
[01:21:36] My being revolted.
[01:21:38] My being revolted.
[01:21:40] 11 days of this, how the hell am I going to be able to do that?
[01:21:43] In two seconds, I answered.
[01:21:46] I walked to as long as it takes, reached down deep, got to go, keep going.
[01:21:53] God helped me.
[01:21:55] Wayne was stoic.
[01:21:56] He was in better shape than I was, but still it had to be tough for him.
[01:22:00] He just board down and put out what was needed to keep on going.
[01:22:04] Some of the other prisoners did as well.
[01:22:07] Many like me had trouble.
[01:22:08] A number complained and a few cried.
[01:22:11] Other prisoners berated them.
[01:22:13] A couple of them fell down and whimpered and the guards yelled at them slapping kicking and
[01:22:17] hitting them with rifle butts until they got up.
[01:22:21] I thought this is going to be a long 11 days.
[01:22:27] And this is just continuing way past 11 days.
[01:22:31] You're now just beyond that.
[01:22:34] Continuing with the story as the days continued, I became weaker and lost weight.
[01:22:39] Others followed waves of shivering chills might be malaria, I suffered from diarrhea,
[01:22:46] probably dysentery.
[01:22:47] My festering ankle wound hurt more, the swelling grew worse aggravated by the journey.
[01:22:53] Leachas plagued me, sucking my blood and adding infections of their own.
[01:22:57] My right leg became a heavy painful mass that I dragged along the trail.
[01:23:02] I must have been a sight.
[01:23:04] Though my wounds placed me in a worse situation, Wayne was sick and deteriorating too.
[01:23:09] He had some sort of jungle fever and lost his appetite.
[01:23:13] He quit eating regular rice, preferred only the crispy layer that formed right next to
[01:23:17] the surface of the cooking pot, what the Vietnamese called calm chae or fire rice.
[01:23:23] Zon was having troubles too.
[01:23:25] Injuries from his shoot down declined from months in captivity, poor diet disease,
[01:23:30] then the daily toll of this horrendous martial north.
[01:23:34] He stepped away, our personal demons threatened our physical ability and meant to willingness
[01:23:40] to press on.
[01:23:42] Everyone suffered.
[01:23:44] We looked like the walking dead, struggling to survive each agonizing mile of that march.
[01:23:50] Most of us stoically face the challenges that beset us.
[01:23:55] Sometimes selfishness and self-pity erupted and tempers flaired, pain and suffering took
[01:24:00] its toll.
[01:24:03] The senior ranking prisoner in our group was fam van Than.
[01:24:07] A major in the South Vietnamese Army.
[01:24:09] He tried his best to be a leader for the 25 South Vietnamese officers and two American
[01:24:14] helicopter pilots under the most trying conditions.
[01:24:17] The enemy gave him no authority to lead.
[01:24:20] I had a lot of respect for what Than tried to do.
[01:24:23] I felt the frustration he had to endure.
[01:24:26] Moral sunk lower and lower, bickering grew rampant.
[01:24:30] The prisoners died, Than was senior, but most dismissed his efforts as they struggled
[01:24:35] to survive.
[01:24:38] And now there's a prisoner that goes down on the trail.
[01:24:42] The guards yelled back and forth to each other.
[01:24:44] They ranted at the prisoner lying on the ground.
[01:24:46] They barked orders to the rest of us.
[01:24:48] I didn't understand any of it.
[01:24:50] Zan said softly, but earnestly to wane in me.
[01:24:53] Keep walking, no stop.
[01:24:55] We continued.
[01:24:57] One guard stayed with the prostate prisoner where he lay.
[01:25:00] We walked on.
[01:25:02] After a short while, bang.
[01:25:07] One shot.
[01:25:09] Sometime later the guard caught up.
[01:25:12] A dull sense of disbelief and shock overcame me.
[01:25:16] I had no doubt what had just happened.
[01:25:20] I kept walking.
[01:25:21] As I cried, it was clear.
[01:25:26] If you could not march, you would die.
[01:25:34] That message really settled into my mind at that point.
[01:25:36] I knew if I ever got to the point where I couldn't march anymore, that would probably
[01:25:40] happen to me as well.
[01:25:44] The aside that I wanted to say about Son was, and it was mentioned Son was a Vietnamese
[01:25:50] Air Force pilot. He was young and strong and in my mind, he was a lot bigger than he
[01:25:57] was, because he still has short-statured Vietnamese.
[01:26:01] He was the A1 pilot that I saw shot down on my way to Ben Hett, that I asked for permission
[01:26:08] to go help rescue.
[01:26:10] We put that together shortly after we started that March north of what he was flying
[01:26:14] where he was when he was shot down.
[01:26:16] That's my God. We were shot down the same day.
[01:26:21] That's one of the reasons I included that piece, because it was such a coincidence or
[01:26:27] fate that you guys were.
[01:26:29] That was him.
[01:26:30] There you were.
[01:26:31] He turned out to be such a good friend.
[01:26:33] I owe my life to several people, Wayne Finch, and Son, especially for what he did for me.
[01:26:44] Back to the book, the journey was a nightmare, a horrid soul-wrenching nightmare.
[01:26:49] It grew worse.
[01:26:50] Others fell out and died.
[01:26:51] Each step every day racked my body with pain.
[01:26:54] My infections became worse, disease was taking me.
[01:26:59] I knew I was sliding closer to death, but I kept fighting as hard as I could.
[01:27:04] To keep my spirits up, I continually thought, continuously thought of my family.
[01:27:08] Of things I would do with Spencer and Vicki when I got home.
[01:27:11] Making of those two kids gave me strength, always bolstered my hope.
[01:27:17] My leg was now swollen to twice its normal size.
[01:27:21] Dark colored filled with pus.
[01:27:23] Long splits formed in the skin.
[01:27:26] Puss and bloody stinking fluid oozed from the cracks.
[01:27:30] I dragged it along like a sodden club.
[01:27:33] Every movement last me with searing pain that kept my face contorted.
[01:27:38] I shrieked a silent cry within.
[01:27:41] And burdened a black and scar deep in the center of my soul.
[01:27:46] Gang green said in, my bloody dysentery worsened.
[01:27:51] I had chills and fevers.
[01:27:53] I would find out later that I had three different kinds of malaria.
[01:27:58] Each morning I fought a battle to stand.
[01:28:03] And with all that going on, I tried to maintain a sense of humor.
[01:28:10] It was hard, but it was necessary.
[01:28:13] Spirit is the most important factor in survival, a sense of human, humor, even under the
[01:28:18] worst conditions helps maintain spirit and in spirit lives hope.
[01:28:24] I was determined to survive.
[01:28:27] Still I owed so much to Wayne and Zahn.
[01:28:30] They helped me during the through the worst and were always concerned about me.
[01:28:34] They did all they could to help me.
[01:28:36] Zahn especially helped me remain positive to be hopeful.
[01:28:39] As bad as things ever got, I never gave up hope.
[01:28:44] I mustered all my will each day just to wake, stand and take a step.
[01:28:51] Then I fought hard for the remainder of the day to keep going, moving along the trail.
[01:28:56] I could barely walk, but somehow I did.
[01:28:59] I survived each day to open my eyes in the morning to the gift of one more dawn.
[01:29:04] Realities of my miserable world or clear, death are constant companion stalked us waiting
[01:29:11] for us to give into its relentless temptation.
[01:29:16] That would be the easy thing to do.
[01:29:19] In normal life, you have to take some over action to die.
[01:29:24] You have to kill yourself.
[01:29:26] As a prisoner of war under these circumstances, that is reversed.
[01:29:32] You have to reach deep within yourself and struggle each day to stay alive.
[01:29:39] Dying is easy.
[01:29:42] Just relax.
[01:29:43] Do nothing.
[01:29:45] Give up.
[01:29:46] Then peacefully surrender.
[01:29:49] Stop gagging down food, stop struggling to walk, stop fighting.
[01:29:54] And you will die.
[01:29:58] They did.
[01:30:04] That is an incredible paradox that you point out there.
[01:30:09] It is something that I saw because it is.
[01:30:13] If you give up, you just die.
[01:30:17] Stop eating and you die.
[01:30:19] It is hard to stay alive.
[01:30:21] You need something to motivate you to stay alive.
[01:30:24] I can't talk enough about those two kids.
[01:30:28] When they listen to this, it is hard to keep them from getting emotional.
[01:30:34] Those two little kids are probably the single most important reason that I survived along
[01:30:43] with a lot of other things that helped.
[01:30:46] That little four years, four and a half year old boy will celebrate his 50th birthday in
[01:30:53] April.
[01:30:54] And you will be there with him.
[01:30:58] Beautiful.
[01:31:02] I think we are getting to the low point here.
[01:31:04] The worst day of my life came a few weeks into this trip.
[01:31:07] I fought hard to continue the march, but I faltered.
[01:31:10] I dug deep inside myself for strength.
[01:31:13] There was nothing there.
[01:31:15] I dug deeper.
[01:31:16] I staggered on and faltered again.
[01:31:19] I struggled more.
[01:31:21] I reached deeper yet.
[01:31:22] I prayed for more strength.
[01:31:25] There was none.
[01:31:28] I collapsed.
[01:31:29] I got up and stumbled along.
[01:31:31] I collapsed again and again.
[01:31:33] And I got up again and again.
[01:31:35] I fought with all I had in my body, heart and soul.
[01:31:41] I collapsed and couldn't get up.
[01:31:44] I could not will myself up.
[01:31:46] I was at the end of my life.
[01:31:50] The guard looked down on me.
[01:31:51] He ordered me up.
[01:31:52] He yelled at me.
[01:31:53] I could not.
[01:31:56] It was done.
[01:31:58] I knew my life was ended.
[01:32:00] Here on this miserable muddy jungle trail, it was over.
[01:32:08] Would my family ever know what had happened to me?
[01:32:13] Then Zon was there looking worried bending over me, the guard yelled at him to stop.
[01:32:18] Undeterred Zon reached down to help me.
[01:32:21] The guard yelled louder but Zon's face was set with determination.
[01:32:26] In spite of whatever threats the guard was screaming, Zon raised me up, turned and pulled
[01:32:31] me onto his frail weak back.
[01:32:34] He wrapped my arms around his neck and clasped my wrists together in front of him.
[01:32:39] The rest of the day he pulled me along, my feet dragging on the ground behind.
[01:32:45] Part of the time he was helped by Lieutenant Hong.
[01:32:48] Longly a big, impish brute helped briefly but it was Zon who carried the burden that day.
[01:32:56] It was Zon who risked his own life to lift me from death.
[01:33:00] It was Zon who carried me and cared for me until we completed that long day struggle
[01:33:08] at another wayside camp.
[01:33:11] I definitely owe him my life absolutely.
[01:33:22] You end up falling into a river as well.
[01:33:25] Yeah, that's the next day when we tried to set out and I couldn't get back up.
[01:33:29] I mean my ankle bone was so infected I could barely move that leg and three kinds of malaria
[01:33:35] and dysentery and three kinds of intestinal parasites, smell absorption syndrome I was just
[01:33:42] a bad bad way.
[01:33:45] You fall into this river, backed the books Zon and Wayne came off the log and down the
[01:33:49] high steep bank to my rescue.
[01:33:52] They waited into the turn and pulled me back onto the bank.
[01:33:55] With Wayne shouting and English and Zon and Vietnamese, they pleaded for the group to stay
[01:33:58] at the camp until I was able to travel again.
[01:34:01] They were ordered away.
[01:34:03] They wouldn't leave me, guards dragged them away and forced them across to the log bridge
[01:34:07] at gunpoint.
[01:34:09] They marched off with the rest of our prisoner group.
[01:34:12] Everyone believed I was left at that camp to die.
[01:34:17] So you get left by that group.
[01:34:19] I do.
[01:34:20] And you go to another camp where they kind of let you recover a little bit.
[01:34:25] Yeah, well I actually stayed in that camp and for some reason the decision was because I
[01:34:29] had any medical treatment to that point at all for months.
[01:34:34] And that camp would me lay it up there.
[01:34:37] They got the camp medic and came over and I got some shots of penicillin.
[01:34:43] I guess the only reason for this decision was we were along the trail and had north and
[01:34:48] they wanted to give me an oil.
[01:34:49] If it all possible, so they did give me penicillin shots for about five days running.
[01:34:55] And as soon as I could stand up again and put any weight on my leg at all, then off we went
[01:35:00] back on the trail.
[01:35:02] And now you're on the trail.
[01:35:03] You were one guard at this point.
[01:35:05] I was one man, one guard, and you don't go north.
[01:35:08] Yeah, too.
[01:35:09] Do these.
[01:35:10] Do you?
[01:35:11] And you're again, you're hiking again, challenging terrain.
[01:35:17] And going back to the book, we continued after day after miserable day.
[01:35:22] The journey was taking its toll, stretching my will to press on again.
[01:35:27] It's like you just keep getting to the bottom and finding more unbelievable.
[01:35:32] Each day is tracked and demanded more than I thought I had to give.
[01:35:36] I was able to go on only by scraping up the few remaining bits of grit that remained in
[01:35:41] the most obscure recesses of my heart and soul.
[01:35:44] I prayed, I commanded, I willed myself to take step after impossible step.
[01:35:50] But effort itself fed an agony festering within me which swelled and nod at my core as
[01:35:56] a weak, followed, wretched weak.
[01:35:59] Malaria, tax and bouts of bloody disentery tortured me.
[01:36:03] The pain of my broken back pierced me every day, the souls of my feet were mosaics of
[01:36:08] raised well, it's an open bleeding gashes and punctures, previously broken toes,
[01:36:13] thrown up as I broke them again.
[01:36:15] And as always, there was the pesky leeches.
[01:36:20] But I was still alive.
[01:36:22] And for that, I thanked God.
[01:36:30] And not only did you thank God, you also still tried to escape in that state.
[01:36:39] That was one of the stupidest things I did in my entire cap to, but yes, I had that in the
[01:36:44] code of conduct, escape, escape, escape.
[01:36:46] And we had planned, even in that first jungle camp, had planned and escaped from there
[01:36:50] with Wayne, but it was because of my poor condition, Wayne said, let's, we're going to
[01:36:56] wait till you get some strength through this and I'm going to work.
[01:36:58] And then, of course, they took us off on the trip that Wayne didn't survive.
[01:37:02] But yes, so the day that I finally did, I mean, had an opportunity.
[01:37:05] You mentioned I was with one guard.
[01:37:07] We'd often travel with groups of other groups of North Vietnamese going up and down the trail.
[01:37:11] And we were traveling with one such group this day.
[01:37:14] And I don't know where you're going to pick up the stories.
[01:37:16] So you can just tell, tell, tell, part of it.
[01:37:18] So my guard zoo is talking to some other North Vietnamese guy and they, and I, we're
[01:37:24] all in a big group.
[01:37:25] And so they fall behind and I'm still with the many group.
[01:37:28] But I'm kind of slowing down and the group is moving away from me.
[01:37:31] And it came around one turn in the trail, one corner, no zoo behind me, no group in front
[01:37:36] of me.
[01:37:37] So just in that instant, I said, this is my chance.
[01:37:40] And plus I knew about where we were, near the Demelitrizone, we were only several miles
[01:37:45] from the coast.
[01:37:46] So that's in the back of my mind.
[01:37:47] I think I could make it.
[01:37:49] So I just took off the trail and headed up the side of a hill with my great escape, which
[01:37:53] is only lasted for a very few, well, I don't even know, lasted two minutes.
[01:37:58] But a very few moments before I was recaptured, were you going to read some of that?
[01:38:03] Yeah, this is what happened.
[01:38:04] You knew get recaptured.
[01:38:05] Here's your thoughts.
[01:38:06] I'm dead.
[01:38:07] It's all over.
[01:38:08] Zoo hovered over me.
[01:38:09] His AK-47, Mujel shifting from the center of my face to the middle of my chest.
[01:38:13] He treats you.
[01:38:14] Why you?
[01:38:15] His face burned red as eyes wild and rage.
[01:38:18] Spit sprayed as he screamed at me.
[01:38:21] This is it.
[01:38:22] His fingers on the trigger.
[01:38:23] He's going to kill me.
[01:38:26] And then you.
[01:38:27] I missed the trail.
[01:38:28] I got lost.
[01:38:29] He didn't shoot.
[01:38:30] He pointed his rifle away in a solemn voice.
[01:38:33] He commanded, get up.
[01:38:34] You do very bad.
[01:38:35] You have big problem now.
[01:38:36] He was shaking and raged.
[01:38:38] He motioned down the hill and said, go.
[01:38:42] I think more that was ever done to me never heard about the incident again.
[01:38:48] My psychological assessment is he was so embarrassed and would have been so much trouble
[01:38:52] to worry.
[01:38:53] Yeah, well, how'd you lose your personal eyes?
[01:38:55] Talk to yourself guy.
[01:38:56] I wasn't.
[01:38:57] He's just like, you know what?
[01:38:58] We're just going to come for that one.
[01:39:00] Yeah, he was out of all the guards that I encountered.
[01:39:04] He was about the worst, the meanest despise me, the most I think of almost anyone that
[01:39:09] I encountered.
[01:39:10] And lucky me, I get stuck with him being my one single
[01:39:12] guard that was moving me after I get stuck with him.
[01:39:15] Was he with you with that original group and that he stayed with him?
[01:39:17] Yeah, in fact, when I've got to that first jungle camp living in the cages, he was
[01:39:22] our interrogator there.
[01:39:24] I almost actually felt sorry for the guy.
[01:39:26] His English was so bad.
[01:39:27] It was as bad as my high school level Spanish was.
[01:39:30] I mean, he just could barely speak English and he's trying to interrogate us and
[01:39:33] propaganda hisists and all this.
[01:39:35] But yeah, so he was the only guard that was spoken English at all.
[01:39:38] So when I had to be separated from the group, they assigned him to be the one to stay
[01:39:42] back with me and move me north.
[01:39:46] And now, again, fast forward, you're now in a truck.
[01:39:52] You're now moving in vehicles.
[01:39:55] Okay, we got in the north.
[01:39:56] Walked all the way up across the north or two the north three enemies border on foot.
[01:40:01] So we're all the way just north of the demelitarized zone at this point.
[01:40:05] And then they put us on trucks to move us in the north Vietnam and inside North Vietnam,
[01:40:09] we'd some nights move and trucks.
[01:40:12] Some days and nights would, would march depending on the threat from American air strikes.
[01:40:15] And of course, the trucks of these old, you know, Soviet air things with no shocks.
[01:40:19] And by the way, you've a broken back at this point and it's not like the roads in North
[01:40:23] Vietnam or in any kind of condition.
[01:40:26] So it's, no, we first got on the trucks.
[01:40:27] I mean, after all this death march north, my my attitude was, oh, trucks.
[01:40:32] This is wonderful.
[01:40:33] God.
[01:40:34] And God, on the bed of that truck, it took about a minute and a half,
[01:40:37] we're driving down the road and that truck with no shocks, no springs, slam, slam, slam,
[01:40:42] to, yeah, you literally had a broken back at this point.
[01:40:45] I literally had a broken back.
[01:40:47] And, and of course, as you said, I think you described this to your wife as a series
[01:40:53] of unfortunate events.
[01:40:55] So now you're out there and you see a flare in the sky.
[01:41:01] You recognize immediately.
[01:41:02] You know what's coming.
[01:41:03] But first to or fly mohawk, up off the coast, we would pick up targets on radar at
[01:41:08] night of the convoys moving along Highway 1 inside North Vietnam and we turn it over to
[01:41:13] F4 fighter jets from the 490, second 97th fighter wing out of Thailand.
[01:41:19] And they were called the night fighters and they dropped flares and then strike the target.
[01:41:22] So yes, I knew exactly what was taking place.
[01:41:25] So you yell out air strike.
[01:41:28] And then here we go back to the book.
[01:41:29] F1st F4 screamed down from altitude and bombs exploded nearby, NVA and to NVA, anti-aircraft
[01:41:35] fire responded.
[01:41:36] The next F4 screeched toward us, more bombs, more anti-aircraft.
[01:41:41] I began repeating, the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[01:41:45] Yay, though I walked through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for
[01:41:50] thou art with me, for thou art with me, good God.
[01:41:54] The earth shook.
[01:41:55] Our truck banged about as if in an earthquake.
[01:41:59] Older's yelled from other trucks as some were hit.
[01:42:02] The world shuddered in explosions and flames.
[01:42:06] Then it was done.
[01:42:11] That was our first, yeah, first or second night on trucks after we got into North Vietnam.
[01:42:18] Yes, so not only did I have the unpleasant bouncing around that was extremely painful.
[01:42:21] I also, I think I mentioned the book got a horrible case of heartburn at night, too.
[01:42:25] I got all this sour belts as going on and then we got that air strike.
[01:42:31] Again, that wasn't the first or last air strike that I experienced, but that was pretty horrific.
[01:42:37] They hit some of the vehicles that were there.
[01:42:38] They did.
[01:42:39] Some of the Vietnamese so-called.
[01:42:41] At this point, when I got right to the border, just before we got into the trucks,
[01:42:45] I was married up with a second group of South Vietnamese prisoners, senior officer, South Vietnamese
[01:42:50] prisoners.
[01:42:51] Our group of prisoners was on one truck, but yeah, other trucks in the convoy got hit
[01:42:55] and people killed and luckily we didn't.
[01:43:00] Now you get into another camp and I'm going back to the book.
[01:43:05] The guards took us to a small hut with posts and enough to tie our hammocks.
[01:43:11] They fastened the door shut and placed local militia guards outside.
[01:43:14] We settled in getting comfortable and resting.
[01:43:17] The door opened.
[01:43:18] A guard came in and said something.
[01:43:20] A South Vietnamese prisoner entered behind him, lieutenant hung.
[01:43:24] My God.
[01:43:25] I knew.
[01:43:27] It was Wayne who had died in this camp.
[01:43:29] Captain Wayne Finch.
[01:43:31] Wayne was dead.
[01:43:32] My God.
[01:43:34] hung stared as if at a ghost, astounded to see me alive.
[01:43:38] He cried.
[01:43:39] I sat slump, devastated at the realization that Wayne Finch was dead.
[01:43:44] My friend Wayne who had helped me cared for me.
[01:43:47] My friend Wayne who I owed so much.
[01:43:50] He was dead.
[01:43:54] Shocked.
[01:43:55] Disbelieving.
[01:43:56] I introduced hung to the others.
[01:43:58] He told us how everyone thought I was dead.
[01:44:01] How the group suffered on the march north after they left me.
[01:44:05] How to tall American pilots join them.
[01:44:07] How Wayne continued to get sicker, lost hope, and grew weak.
[01:44:12] I fell into sadness, twisting it into melancholy self-pity, sinking to the lowest point.
[01:44:19] I had known.
[01:44:25] And I had to be to be devastating.
[01:44:27] It was.
[01:44:28] We had been separated and what I got to this camp with the new group of South Vietnamese.
[01:44:33] When we arrived at the camp, the camp commander gave a speech.
[01:44:37] I could hear him say, Finch and the South Vietnamese officers transform.
[01:44:42] We said, do you know of Finch?
[01:44:43] There was an American Finch that died in this camp.
[01:44:45] I said, no one even knew what I should have put together with the bad pronunciation was
[01:44:52] Finch.
[01:44:53] And hung had been one of the guys who helped drag me through the jungle with the sun.
[01:44:58] And as soon as I saw hung, I knew that it was Finch.
[01:45:02] They took me to see the grave where he was buried.
[01:45:06] At least that rough idea of where we were helped me when I came back to my debriefs to
[01:45:11] get that location to the Americans.
[01:45:13] And eventually took a few years for several years.
[01:45:15] Wayne's body was recovered and brought back.
[01:45:18] That was a low morale point for me on the trip.
[01:45:22] That was devastating.
[01:45:23] You're going to go to the potato story?
[01:45:25] No, tell the potato story.
[01:45:26] Okay, I'll tell the potatoes.
[01:45:27] Because this is another guy.
[01:45:28] There are two Vietnamese.
[01:45:29] A lot of people helped me to follow you.
[01:45:32] I survived.
[01:45:33] Tell the potato story and then I'll wrap it up for you.
[01:45:36] Because it's, yeah, tell the potato story.
[01:45:37] Okay.
[01:45:38] How would you do that time?
[01:45:39] Where did this go in on and on?
[01:45:40] We're good.
[01:45:41] All right.
[01:45:42] So, son, it helped me as we already described.
[01:45:45] But in the second group of prisoners, I came to know one Lieutenant Colonel Kayn Yim, who
[01:45:52] today lives in San Jose, California.
[01:45:53] I'm still a dear friend.
[01:45:55] But Kay when he was captured, had a gold cross pen.
[01:45:59] I mean, real gold.
[01:46:00] It was a very valuable pen.
[01:46:01] When he was captured, he hid it in the lining of his uniform.
[01:46:04] He was going to trade it for something for his own benefit when he got to wherever
[01:46:08] he was going to get to.
[01:46:10] So I'm in the state that you've described.
[01:46:12] I'm just physically erect now emotionally mentally in a low.
[01:46:16] We're being held in a hut.
[01:46:18] There's a local militia guy guarding it outside.
[01:46:20] Kay goes to the wall.
[01:46:22] That's wall and talks to the guy.
[01:46:24] And I see him hand his pen out to the guy.
[01:46:27] And the guy disappears.
[01:46:28] A couple hours later, the guy returns with a small bag and passes it in.
[01:46:32] And the bag were six potatoes.
[01:46:34] So Kay had traded his valuable, crock gold cross pen for six potatoes.
[01:46:40] Had a potato cooked each day for the next six days for me.
[01:46:45] And I ate it.
[01:46:46] Kay wouldn't take any potatoes.
[01:46:47] None of the other Vietnamese senior officers would take any of the potatoes.
[01:46:51] They were from me.
[01:46:52] And just, I mean, both the physical strength the potatoes gave me.
[01:46:57] But even more importantly, just the mental lift that his sacrifice gave from me.
[01:47:03] I really brought me out of my, out of my doldrums, and gave me the spirit to go on.
[01:47:08] Unbelievable.
[01:47:09] The one more thing that happens with Kay, you're getting ready to leave the camp to go to a new camp.
[01:47:17] Right.
[01:47:18] And Kay tapped my arm.
[01:47:19] Look, he said, the curious militia guard who'd been so interested in learning about
[01:47:23] South Vietnam and America, who'd fetched my potatoes, stood there looking like a kid with
[01:47:29] a new puppy.
[01:47:30] He came close to the truck and I lean against the state side.
[01:47:35] Goodbye, he said, grinning.
[01:47:38] His simple humanity made me smile and I said, goodbye.
[01:47:43] Kay saw my astonishment.
[01:47:44] He wanted to learn to say goodbye to you when you leave.
[01:47:48] I teach him.
[01:47:49] He good man.
[01:47:51] Yes, I fought.
[01:47:53] No doubt he is.
[01:47:54] There are good men everywhere.
[01:47:57] That's the governments, the systems, the leaders that are bad.
[01:48:00] It's communism that sucks, not the people of North Vietnam.
[01:48:05] They are not so different from the South, not so different from me.
[01:48:15] I learned a lot of lessons on this trip.
[01:48:19] I learned a lot of lessons about humanity and people.
[01:48:24] I do, honestly, believe we are all God's children.
[01:48:30] You and I had the good fortune to be born where we were born in this wonderful country
[01:48:34] of ours.
[01:48:36] Others have had the not so good fortune.
[01:48:40] I came across good people in Vietnam and he, though he was my enemy, was one.
[01:48:48] Sometimes people ask me if I have any hatred for those guys in the treatment that I got
[01:48:52] and I don't.
[01:48:54] I think they were human beings, not so different than you and me.
[01:49:00] They had their news controlled by their government.
[01:49:03] They were suffering, their strikes, and everything else.
[01:49:06] They behaved the way that they behaved.
[01:49:08] I guess the one guy still don't care much for was it's Sue, but we'd probably get over
[01:49:12] to fight if I ever met the guy.
[01:49:14] I don't have any hatred.
[01:49:17] There's people like you and I.
[01:49:19] There was even times, I mean, we're walking through a village and now you're North Vietnam
[01:49:24] not know where what you're just talking about, they've been bombed, they lost their sons
[01:49:28] and they're trying to basically attack you.
[01:49:30] They're throwing rocks at you.
[01:49:32] And the guys that are guarding you actually, I don't think they shot at them, but they
[01:49:36] fired over their heads to protect you.
[01:49:40] Which I'd found to be in my South Vietnamese friends.
[01:49:43] I mean, you'll talk to people who have the experience in the Vietnam war and you get all
[01:49:45] kinds of different opinions of the South Vietnamese and good worthless whatever.
[01:49:52] They have all varieties like we are.
[01:49:54] There are some that, violently and bravely, like the guys at Firebase Charlie, the people
[01:49:58] that I was with as a prisoner of war were great human beings.
[01:50:02] When we'd get attacked, yeah, the first thing they put me and they, the Communist Guards,
[01:50:07] it's took me in the middle, but then the South Vietnamese willingly would form perimeter
[01:50:10] around me and then the guards are on the outside firing as necessary all to protect me.
[01:50:19] One time going back to book, the guards start screaming, be num, hey, be num, hey.
[01:50:24] Bonham, bonham, hi.
[01:50:26] Bonham, hi.
[01:50:27] Which means, bb, num, five, hi, too.
[01:50:32] And for those of you that don't translate that real quick, that's b 52.
[01:50:36] The bombs drop, hundreds of bombs fell, all around us, big bombs, nearly on top of us.
[01:50:43] I knew there was little chance of living through a B 52 strike, but by the grace of God
[01:50:47] no bombs fell in our crater.
[01:50:49] The earth trembled at shook, it ruptured and heaved, waves of crushing pressure blasted
[01:50:54] through a squeezing, hurting my head in the ears, the suffocating pressure was painful, awful,
[01:51:00] frightening.
[01:51:01] It stopped.
[01:51:03] I was crying, I was dead, I knew it.
[01:51:07] I felt ringing in my ears, froping in my head.
[01:51:10] I must be alive.
[01:51:12] Next to me, the officer sat up and holstered his pistol, by the way, you had the guy drawn
[01:51:16] his pistol and held it to your head to make sure he was going to escape during the B 52 strike.
[01:51:22] K was moving, others began setting up days, but alive, no one could hear.
[01:51:28] No one spoke.
[01:51:29] We crawled out of the hole and started walking in direction we'd been traveling.
[01:51:33] This was in North Vietnam.
[01:51:35] We'd come upon an area of a lot of bomb craters, they'd been bomb frequently.
[01:51:39] The enemy shot two anti-aircraft rounds.
[01:51:42] That seemed to be their signal.
[01:51:43] Two rounds was an air strike.
[01:51:45] The other started shouting, bottom high and all hell broke loose upon us.
[01:51:51] Now you get to Hanoi, right?
[01:51:55] And you get a bed, a board, okay, a board.
[01:52:00] There's a blanket though.
[01:52:01] There was a blanket, it gets cold and a French bread.
[01:52:06] That's how you call it, French bread.
[01:52:09] I was in New York.
[01:52:10] It's like a small piece of French bread is what it looked like.
[01:52:13] But it was just, I mean, it was kind of half rotten and pieces of rock and stick and
[01:52:18] junk and it was just...
[01:52:19] It's what he even did the book.
[01:52:21] Because when you first talk about the French bread, you French bread, and then it cl-
[01:52:24] It's a real grunt here.
[01:52:25] It's a couple of parrots, or maybe a couple pages later you're saying there was bugs.
[01:52:29] And he sticks.
[01:52:30] But when you first got that French bread, the first I was putting solitary confinement
[01:52:33] my first prison and I was brought a meal.
[01:52:35] And now the whole time I was captured down in the jungle, we got a ball of great, a great
[01:52:39] fruit-sized ball of rice in the morning, a great fruit-sized ball of rice in the evening
[01:52:42] for our food.
[01:52:43] That's what we got hiking up the Hoachman Trail.
[01:52:46] We would, in the evenings, they would cook rice that the communist would and we would get
[01:52:50] about that same equivalent of our ball size of rice and then we would roll up a ball to eat
[01:52:55] during the journey on the next morning.
[01:52:58] So it was the same thing, two great-sized balls of rice a day.
[01:53:01] That's all that I had with an occasional piece of man-yuck and maybe some, oh, what
[01:53:09] they had to do, they call it.
[01:53:11] Bamboo shoot.
[01:53:12] A case of almost ages of rice.
[01:53:13] So I get to Henoie.
[01:53:14] I'm in solitary confinement.
[01:53:16] They bring me a meal.
[01:53:21] They're played at being spraised with this piece of French bread on the side.
[01:53:24] And I'm sitting there for a lot of reasons.
[01:53:26] I mean, I knew that I was in Henoie.
[01:53:27] I knew that this horrible trip of walking every single day and not knowing how I was going
[01:53:33] to survive through that day.
[01:53:34] All that was over.
[01:53:35] I'm here.
[01:53:36] I'm in Henoie.
[01:53:37] Oh, plus they'd give me a bath and gave me a prison uniform and shave me.
[01:53:41] I mean, I had not shaved the whole time.
[01:53:43] So I've been a prisoner for months.
[01:53:47] And I sat there and they brought that food.
[01:53:49] And I did.
[01:53:50] I cried.
[01:53:51] Tears rolled down my cheeks.
[01:53:52] I knew for the first time, since I was shot down, there was no doubt in my mind.
[01:53:57] I was going to survive.
[01:53:59] That was no longer a question.
[01:54:00] All I had to do was gut out those last.
[01:54:01] However long it was going to be in Henoie.
[01:54:04] They had given me this wonderful food of bean sprouts and this piece of crappy French bread.
[01:54:09] But it was wonderful.
[01:54:11] That's beautiful.
[01:54:15] And here's, as this continues here in Henoie, I'm going back to the book.
[01:54:21] I stood in a cell about 12 feet wide and 25 feet long.
[01:54:25] Six bunks lined up to my right.
[01:54:27] Head and against the wall.
[01:54:29] Two others lay lengthwise against the wall to my left.
[01:54:31] The bunks were three by six foot pieces of wood resting on saw horses of the same width.
[01:54:37] He chose covered with a bamboo mat.
[01:54:38] A blanket neatly folded on one end.
[01:54:41] When we in the bunk or my left I saw two buckets just like the one in my, one's in my solitary
[01:54:45] cells.
[01:54:46] A row of three small window slits six by 18 inches opened high at the back at the top of
[01:54:53] the back wall.
[01:54:55] Seven sets of eyes fixed on me.
[01:54:58] One approached and put out his hand.
[01:55:01] I'm John Murphy, captain, Air Force.
[01:55:05] How you doing?
[01:55:07] Americans.
[01:55:09] They're a room full of Americans.
[01:55:12] Oh God bless you.
[01:55:15] And that's your, your with these other prisoners.
[01:55:19] And I hadn't seen another American since I split up from that group all that time ago
[01:55:24] on the trail.
[01:55:25] It was a glorious moment to come out of solitary confinement.
[01:55:28] We put in a room with seven other guys.
[01:55:31] And you know this is one of the things that I talked about you as we were getting ready
[01:55:34] to record.
[01:55:37] I said, look.
[01:55:38] I want to read your entire book on this podcast because it's so good.
[01:55:43] And nobody's going to want to go buy the book.
[01:55:45] I just heard the whole book read and one of the decisions that I made was one of the
[01:55:50] things that you do in here is this is a book about you.
[01:55:54] But you do a wonderful and a beautiful job of describing and telling the stories of all
[01:56:01] these other heroes that you're with.
[01:56:05] And as a matter of fact, you call this chapter chapter 12 in the company of heroes with
[01:56:09] all these other Americans that you know, you told me on the way over here and you talk
[01:56:12] about it in the book.
[01:56:13] You'd been in you were there for at this point.
[01:56:16] What six months were you there at this point seven months?
[01:56:19] Yeah, something like that.
[01:56:21] Some of these guys had been in captivity for three years five years seven years.
[01:56:28] Seven years.
[01:56:29] And then the one guy I talked about in their gym tops and have been a prisoner for nine
[01:56:32] years.
[01:56:33] I felt I needed to do that in this book.
[01:56:35] I had some real mixed feelings about writing this book.
[01:56:38] I didn't want to do a book focused, you know, this happened to me story and I did all
[01:56:43] this great stuff.
[01:56:44] I know I suffered.
[01:56:45] But there were so many other prisoners from this Southern experience.
[01:56:49] That's a story I wanted to tell this different Southern experience.
[01:56:52] It's different than the prisoners who were shot down in capture in the north.
[01:56:55] So many of these guys, many many of these guys suffered so much more than I did.
[01:57:00] So much more time and captivity than I did.
[01:57:02] So I do share those stories of those guys in the company of heroes.
[01:57:06] When I got to Hanoi, got into the prison of plantation gardens, I met these other guys
[01:57:11] and they had the truly incredible heroic stories to share.
[01:57:16] And you do a phenomenal job in the book of describing them who they were, what they've
[01:57:24] been through.
[01:57:26] Bill Gont, Al Krabov.
[01:57:28] John Parcell's Bill Thomas Bill Henderson Dave Mott.
[01:57:33] Just you go through the guys.
[01:57:35] Now those are the guys of my cell and I don't know if you got any of them.
[01:57:38] I don't know if you got any of them.
[01:57:39] They're out of the eight guys in the cell.
[01:57:40] Four of us were named Bill.
[01:57:41] That's just crazy.
[01:57:42] Eight Americans in a cell and four of us named Bill.
[01:57:46] So I became new Bill.
[01:57:49] There was a Bill Gant was an Air Force pilot, about 6465.
[01:57:53] He was big Bill.
[01:57:55] There was a Marine War officer who was some prehistoric elderly gentleman.
[01:57:58] The poor guy was 36 years old.
[01:58:01] We couldn't believe he'd survived, but he was old Bill and then we had an Air Force OV10
[01:58:07] pilot who became young Bill.
[01:58:08] So we had four Bills out of the eight guys.
[01:58:11] But yeah, then the others.
[01:58:13] And those guys had all suffered too, but then there were other guys in the camp.
[01:58:19] Shoot Dennis Thompson and Harvey Brand, two special forces guys, Captain Longway.
[01:58:26] There are experiences, so many others.
[01:58:29] Five guys, but TV station in a way, who are capturing a tent.
[01:58:33] I mean, who would think that a TV radio station, TV station crew would get capture,
[01:58:38] but they had all of their trials and tribulations.
[01:58:41] And then the most was Jim Thompson in his nine years of suffering as a prisoner of
[01:58:47] one.
[01:58:48] One of the guys I do want to highlight is Colonel Ted Guy.
[01:58:52] Some would go to the book.
[01:58:53] Yeah, our senior ranking officer.
[01:58:55] And someone's briefing you kind of telling you what's going on.
[01:58:59] And here's what Dave says, Dave Maup.
[01:59:02] He says, the SRO, that's the senior ranking officer for the camp is Colonel Ted Guy.
[01:59:09] He's in the shed up on top of the camp.
[01:59:11] That's where they've segregated the senior officers and NCOs from the rest of us.
[01:59:16] He's an Air Force lieutenant colonel who must have been promoted to Fulberg by now.
[01:59:20] He went down over Laos in an F4 in 1968.
[01:59:23] He's a good leader and a real hard ass.
[01:59:26] He runs a tight ship.
[01:59:27] Doesn't allow making any propaganda statements.
[01:59:31] No one can accept early release.
[01:59:33] We live by the code of conduct.
[01:59:36] He's taken a lot of beatings and torture for us.
[01:59:39] We call him the Hawk.
[01:59:41] Alcraboth jumped in immediately.
[01:59:44] Yeah, and we're Hawk's heroes.
[01:59:47] Just like Hogan's heroes on the TV show, only we don't have as much fun.
[01:59:51] He had a shitty eating grin on his face.
[01:59:54] He also looked like crap.
[01:59:57] So that's, I thought it was, that's one of the, you know, you, again, you go through all
[02:00:03] these guys and what they've done.
[02:00:06] And you also talk about, you talk about some of those heroes that held the line and
[02:00:10] you also talk about another group who I'll go to here.
[02:00:15] Sometimes I could hear a lot of noise from the other side of the wall separating our
[02:00:18] road sales from those on the further end of our building.
[02:00:23] I could see the top of a basketball hoop, an occasional volleyball arched high over
[02:00:28] an out of sight net.
[02:00:31] What's up with that?
[02:00:32] I asked, that's the peace committee.
[02:00:34] Came the answer.
[02:00:35] What's the peace committee?
[02:00:37] Eight guys who collaborate with the enemy.
[02:00:40] They've been ordered to stop, but they won't.
[02:00:43] They study communism, do propaganda, make radio broadcasts, even rat on the
[02:00:48] other Americans.
[02:00:50] For that, they get packages, get to write letters, and can go outside whenever they
[02:00:55] won and play games.
[02:00:57] We call them the ducks because the way they followed, followed the guards around and
[02:01:02] do their bidding.
[02:01:04] They'll rotten hell, I said, that they will.
[02:01:08] The collaborators were, but a small but significant minority among us.
[02:01:12] There were 107 prisoners at plantation gardens and except for the eight in the peace committee,
[02:01:18] all were patriotic loyal Americans who resisted enemy interrogations, propaganda, and pressure
[02:01:24] to sign statements and make radio broadcasts.
[02:01:27] We resisted with everything we had.
[02:01:32] And then, you know, you got time.
[02:01:35] Time those guys back to Colonel Guy.
[02:01:37] I can't say enough about Colonel Guy.
[02:01:38] He's passed away several years ago now.
[02:01:41] So what a strong leader.
[02:01:44] And we talk about military discipline in the requirement for it in officers' instances
[02:01:49] at what in prison camp, that discipline was so essential and so sought after by everyone.
[02:01:57] We were lucky to have Colonel Guy as our senior ranking officer.
[02:02:02] He was so tough and by the rules and the code and thank goodness because that's what we all
[02:02:08] needed to hear and to have that standard to live by.
[02:02:13] Just a great and wonderful human being.
[02:02:16] When we got back, you know, there was several who would have strangled some of those peace
[02:02:20] committee guys, especially some of our special forces guys were captured with us.
[02:02:24] But Colonel Guy put out an order and he said, this is a direct order.
[02:02:29] Everyone stay away from the peace committee.
[02:02:31] I'm going to take care of this.
[02:02:32] I got it.
[02:02:33] Don't you do anything.
[02:02:36] Colonel Guy pressed charges against the peace committee again and again was overridden.
[02:02:40] Charges were never brought against them.
[02:02:42] But what did happen is Colonel Guy's career was was curtailed far before it should have been.
[02:02:47] But I have the deepest respect for him as our senior officer.
[02:02:52] Yeah.
[02:02:53] And again, I'm going to say this again.
[02:02:56] You go through these stories of some of the other heroes.
[02:03:01] You just mentioned Dennis Thomas.
[02:03:03] Absolutely.
[02:03:06] Bill Murray.
[02:03:07] I mean, you just you go through these stories and then they're just all phenomenal and you
[02:03:12] do them such such an honor telling their stories.
[02:03:17] So by this book so that you can read these stories because I don't have time to go through
[02:03:23] them all here.
[02:03:25] The one thing I want to point out though is going back to the book.
[02:03:29] We also try to keep our humor going within the cell and Alan me as the central culprit's
[02:03:34] telling, disgustingly bad jokes back and forth.
[02:03:37] Al was getting a lot better.
[02:03:40] His nausea was subsiding because he was really sick.
[02:03:42] His naughty were subsiding in his boils healing.
[02:03:45] Some of the guys exercised to fight the deterioration of their bodies.
[02:03:49] I couldn't even lie on my back, let alone trying to do sit-ups.
[02:03:53] What I could do was try to get into a position to try push-ups.
[02:03:58] I tried once in the jungle and failed.
[02:04:01] I couldn't raise myself up off the ground.
[02:04:03] Now I was able to push all the way up once and halfway through a second.
[02:04:07] Pretty sad for a guy who could do a hundred push-ups before.
[02:04:10] I kept at for at it for weeks until I was able to do several as part of my daily routine.
[02:04:17] And the reason I point that out is because I always say, you know, because people get injured,
[02:04:22] people come with sickness, do what you can.
[02:04:24] Yes.
[02:04:25] And do what you can.
[02:04:26] And that's exactly what you are doing.
[02:04:30] So, so important.
[02:04:35] December 18th, 1972 after many weeks of quiet, we got bombed like none of us had ever
[02:04:40] been bombed before.
[02:04:42] Air raid sirens, wailed, barrages of Sam's fire and bombs poured down.
[02:04:46] American B-52s had arrived in force over and away.
[02:04:50] Bombs fell close and plantation garden shook.
[02:04:53] We lay on our bunk, hoping our bombers knew where our camp was.
[02:04:57] Still, we fell back into a mindset we'd all developed in captivity.
[02:05:03] What will be will be?
[02:05:05] No sense of worrying about something.
[02:05:07] You absolutely have no control over which is.
[02:05:09] Yeah, of course we're not going to stop a bomb from landing on our head.
[02:05:14] That was the Christmas bombing in 1972 that Nixon ordered to finally bring the communist
[02:05:19] to the bargaining table.
[02:05:21] And I had to put this part in here, I had to read it.
[02:05:28] So after those, after that massive bombing, repercussion.
[02:05:32] So there's a guard that you, that you had nicknamed repercussion.
[02:05:35] Repregution, a guard so named because of his violent outbursts and threats against prisoners
[02:05:40] stood against the wall as we milled around the water trough.
[02:05:44] He spoke something, Lish.
[02:05:46] Old Bill Thomas walked over to him and said, you think those air strikes were bad?
[02:05:51] What the guard asked?
[02:05:53] You think those air strikes were bad last night, Bill said again, yes, bad bombing.
[02:05:58] Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:06:01] Way to lay drop an A-bomb on your fucking ass.
[02:06:06] I gasped and smiled, old Bill Proud Marine.
[02:06:09] He'd been pretty quiet guy, but not me more.
[02:06:11] We all glowed inside after the bombing.
[02:06:14] It was a huge morale boost.
[02:06:16] The bombings went all night after night, not without impunity.
[02:06:19] The B-52s got shot down, their ghastly giant carcasses burning, falling.
[02:06:23] We wondered sadly about the fate of the crews.
[02:06:26] We lost their craft yet they kept coming.
[02:06:29] Quietly, we cheered them on.
[02:06:31] Yeah, that was a huge morale boost.
[02:06:34] And Bill Thomas, boy, bless us hard, because he was always kind of a quiet guy, but he just
[02:06:38] let it all out that morning.
[02:06:40] That's so awesome.
[02:06:43] Okay, now we're in the, in the Hanoi, the infamous.
[02:06:47] Yeah, they moved us into middle of all that bombing attacks.
[02:06:50] They loaded us up one night on trucks at the plantation garden, drove around.
[02:06:53] I don't know, it seemed like for a couple hours.
[02:06:55] I think they were just trying to disorient us.
[02:06:56] We thought their tickets out in the country because of the bombings.
[02:06:59] And then they came to a stop and we got out of the trucks.
[02:07:01] And finally, we're only a few blower several blocks where we started at the Hanoi Hill.
[02:07:08] And now they set up like a little movie night for you guys.
[02:07:11] Oh, yeah.
[02:07:12] So, I've heard for the at the Hanoi Hill, my little movie night, and they set you down
[02:07:17] for the movie night.
[02:07:20] You guys are making fun of the projector operator.
[02:07:22] And finally, they tell you quiet, no talk.
[02:07:25] And then the movie starts back to the book.
[02:07:26] The film was of Jane Fonda visiting North Vietnam.
[02:07:30] We saw an American converting among the enemy leadership supporting their cause.
[02:07:37] Jane's appeared of her climbing into the Gunner seat on an NVA anti-aircraft gun wearing
[02:07:43] a clean white blouse, smiling broadly, laughing, donning a North Vietnamese army helmet with
[02:07:50] live ammunition at her feet that would later shoot down American planes.
[02:07:57] In the film, she sent a message to American servicemen calling us war criminals.
[02:08:03] She said we were following the orders of other war criminals that were like the leaders
[02:08:08] of Germany and Japan and World War II who were executed for their crimes.
[02:08:15] I was stunned.
[02:08:16] We didn't dare speak out loud, but we had plenty to say to each other when we got back
[02:08:21] inside our cell.
[02:08:23] Days later, they showed us some news clippings from American newspapers and magazines.
[02:08:27] They all had news of war protests.
[02:08:31] One was former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark demanding that American stop bombing North
[02:08:38] Vietnamese sit dikes.
[02:08:41] He had been Attorney General under President Johnson during the buildup of American forces
[02:08:45] in Vietnam.
[02:08:46] Now he was making statements from a noise that was inhumane to bomb dikes and that we
[02:08:50] should never do it again.
[02:08:52] A photo showed him standing beside a dike with a single bomb crater.
[02:08:57] I knew he did not have an air campaign to destroy the dikes.
[02:09:01] This was an airant bomb.
[02:09:04] The war protesters at home never bothered me.
[02:09:07] In fact, I took pride in fighting communism in this far corner of the earth so Americans
[02:09:13] could have the right to protest in the streets.
[02:09:17] It was a sacred honor to defend the right of other Americans to disagree with me or anything
[02:09:24] within our American system of government.
[02:09:29] I do believe that so strongly.
[02:09:34] The core of our democracy is not that we all get in line and march forth.
[02:09:40] Take us to 1984.
[02:09:42] The strength of our American democracy is that we can have different views and people disagree
[02:09:46] in the health of the democracy.
[02:09:48] When those disagreements can be argued and discussed and then you reach a solution,
[02:09:53] they are a democratic solution and you go forward.
[02:09:57] That's the beauty of our system.
[02:09:58] Never mind even during the war.
[02:10:00] People say, oh, isn't this horrible?
[02:10:02] These guys, no, exactly what I said there.
[02:10:05] The riot fighting is an American soldier to defend the American way of life which is democratic
[02:10:11] disagreement and arguments.
[02:10:13] They have had it guys.
[02:10:14] You want to protest.
[02:10:15] Go protest.
[02:10:17] Beautiful.
[02:10:18] Now you, I'm going to go to the book.
[02:10:26] We join the rest of our cellmates and press close to Jose.
[02:10:33] And Zaldua.
[02:10:34] And Zaldua.
[02:10:35] A Tom Marine, a Tom Marine Corporal captured a couple years before.
[02:10:39] He quietly related what he'd gathered from the broadcast.
[02:10:43] So he was a translator.
[02:10:44] He was e-stropping.
[02:10:45] Listen, they're very translated.
[02:10:46] One of the guards was out in the courtyard playing a radio.
[02:10:48] It's never did.
[02:10:49] I never heard them.
[02:10:50] But obviously there was some important news coming.
[02:10:52] So his guard had a radio out in the courtyard listening and Jose heard what was said on
[02:10:56] the radio.
[02:10:57] And he says it sounded like a piece of agreement was signed and the war is ended.
[02:11:01] And you kind of get that confirmed.
[02:11:05] Back to the book.
[02:11:06] That afternoon, we were taken into the courtyard with our fellow plantation garden prisoners
[02:11:09] from the cell next door.
[02:11:11] Film crews stood behind a couple of big old funky cameras set up on tripods.
[02:11:16] We stood and rose as instructed waiting for whatever might come.
[02:11:20] And order passed through the ranks.
[02:11:22] Hawke says if it's good news, no reaction, no smiles, no shouting, nothing for propaganda.
[02:11:29] Nope.
[02:11:30] I love that.
[02:11:31] He's just hard to the end.
[02:11:34] And then Doc who's the camp commander.
[02:11:37] He says he looks up and says the piece of agreement is signed.
[02:11:43] You all go home.
[02:11:45] He waited for us to cheer, nothing.
[02:11:47] He looked up apologetically at the film director.
[02:11:50] Then back to us with a hint of the scowl.
[02:11:52] And he goes through the whole points of what the piece of accord has in it.
[02:11:59] And as you read the remaining highlights all faded into a dull drone, I'd heard the most
[02:12:05] important one to me.
[02:12:06] The war's over.
[02:12:07] We're going home within 60 days.
[02:12:09] I made it.
[02:12:11] Thank you, God.
[02:12:13] We went back to ourselves.
[02:12:15] Yeah, that was, that was the major why I was going to do it getting the heads up.
[02:12:22] And then we confronted the guards in the next morning and they denied, no, no, no, no.
[02:12:26] And put the other in that afternoon.
[02:12:27] We got let out in the courtyard and got the agreements read to us.
[02:12:30] What a tremendous feeling.
[02:12:33] But it was a tremendous feeling and then stop just short there because we weren't home yet.
[02:12:39] We weren't going to believe it until it happened.
[02:12:41] Still at 60 days, 60 days.
[02:12:45] And they actually consolidate other prisoners now.
[02:12:47] Right.
[02:12:48] They started doing releases earlier on.
[02:12:49] It was supposed to be the longest held and most seriously injured that got out first.
[02:12:53] And then the releases were going to be spaced out in several groups over a period of 60
[02:12:57] days.
[02:12:58] Back to the book here.
[02:13:00] After the new group joined us, we'd hear God awful shrieks in the middle of the
[02:13:04] night.
[02:13:05] I thought it might be Ted Gostos, an intelligence officer captured in at way in 1968.
[02:13:11] He'd been hung from ropes, denied water, severely beaten for extended periods, bashed
[02:13:17] in the head with an AK-47 and kicked in the stomach in an effort to gain valuable intelligence
[02:13:21] he never revealed.
[02:13:23] Gostos was now a physical wreck who'd been driven to the precipice of insanity, sometimes
[02:13:28] dangling dangerously over its edge.
[02:13:32] But it wasn't Ted who was screaming in the night.
[02:13:36] It was Jim Thompson.
[02:13:39] Jim kept to himself.
[02:13:41] He was hard to get to know, but in time he began to open up to me and share some things
[02:13:46] about himself.
[02:13:48] He was only 39 years old and God he looked like hell.
[02:13:51] He'd been through more shit for a longer time than any other American soldier in history.
[02:14:02] And nine years, and you do a beautiful job of recounting the story that he told you.
[02:14:13] So this is the first person, the first person report of what happened.
[02:14:21] And again, it's an incredible, incredibly horrifying and heroic story that everybody needs
[02:14:31] to read about.
[02:14:34] And when he finishes telling you the story of how what he'd been through up to that point,
[02:14:40] I'm going back to book, I looked into his eyes and saw a troubled soul.
[02:14:45] He survived captivity for nearly nine years longer than any other American soldier in history.
[02:14:53] He did take in a lot from him.
[02:14:56] My God, Jim, that's incredible, I said.
[02:15:00] He smiled weekly and looked down.
[02:15:03] Prisoner releases began a few days later.
[02:15:08] Jim is truly an unsung American hero.
[02:15:10] Most Americans don't even know of him.
[02:15:14] The longest held American prisoner, military prisoner of war in history.
[02:15:21] I mean, most people don't know much about the Vietnam War anyway.
[02:15:24] There's not very much taught in our history books or classes, but those who do know
[02:15:28] something about the Vietnam War, if you ask them who the longest held prisoner was, they
[02:15:32] will respond Navy Lieutenant Ev Alvarez.
[02:15:37] Lieutenant Alvarez was the longest held prisoner shot down over North Vietnam.
[02:15:42] He was not the longest held prisoner from the Vietnam War.
[02:15:46] Jim Thompson has several months more time and captivity than Ev Alvarez.
[02:15:52] So I don't want to take anything away from Alvarez, but Jim never got the recognition
[02:15:59] really.
[02:16:00] I mean, it's been mentioned here and there, but as far as people realizing and giving
[02:16:02] him the honor that he deserved, never received that as being the longest held American
[02:16:08] military prisoner in history.
[02:16:11] And he's passed away now, a regrettable.
[02:16:13] Well, we will do our best to spread that word on here.
[02:16:16] I've actually ordered a book about him and I will make sure I spread the word to the best
[02:16:24] of my ability about his service in sacrifice and heroism.
[02:16:30] And the way you do it in here is an incredible tribute to what he went through as well.
[02:16:37] Now the days go by.
[02:16:41] They finally get you to pack up your gear.
[02:16:44] Give you some new clothes, put you on a bus, and take you out.
[02:16:49] And here we go.
[02:16:52] Back to the book.
[02:16:53] We milled around for half an hour talking to one of ourselves and getting no information
[02:16:56] from the guards.
[02:16:57] The staff car returned and we were soon back on the bus.
[02:17:01] Afraid we were heading back to the Hilton.
[02:17:04] But when we came to a row of derelict hangers, we knew we must be on Hanoi's
[02:17:09] Gai Lam, Gilaam Airport, used by enemy megfighters jets throughout the war.
[02:17:17] The bus turned at a shabby hanger with a rickety control tower at its side.
[02:17:23] I beheld one of the most wondrous sights I'd ever seen.
[02:17:27] Before us was a big, shiny, beautiful C141 met a backplane parked on the ramp.
[02:17:34] The American flag and a red cross were painted high on its tail.
[02:17:39] The words, US Air Force were printed boldly on the fuselage just behind the cockpit.
[02:17:46] I cannot describe the emotion that filled me.
[02:17:50] I can't even imagine.
[02:17:55] And you guys load up.
[02:17:58] Take off.
[02:17:59] And here we go back to the book.
[02:18:01] I was happy at anxious as the big jet rolled down the runway.
[02:18:06] Once airborne, we remained silent, absorbed in our thoughts.
[02:18:10] We seemed to be waiting for something.
[02:18:12] But none of us knew quite what it was until the pilot came on the intercom.
[02:18:19] Thought you would all like to know that we have just passed beyond Sam missile range.
[02:18:25] We erupted in a spontaneous cheer.
[02:18:28] I was overwhelmed with joy.
[02:18:31] It was real.
[02:18:32] We were free.
[02:18:34] We were going home.
[02:18:38] Nothing could stop that now.
[02:18:40] Yeah, we were really, even though we didn't consciously know it or talk about it, we
[02:18:46] didn't have the feeling that we were home free until that moment when the pilot came on
[02:18:53] it said because yeah, the missiles couldn't shoot us down.
[02:18:56] We were on our way ahead of the Philippines.
[02:19:02] I'm going to again skip through.
[02:19:05] We're running a little long on time.
[02:19:09] But one of the things I wanted to point out in here is that you got back.
[02:19:13] You're going through your in the hospital.
[02:19:14] You're going through somewhere you're recovery.
[02:19:18] You get asked to talk about taking you to talk to this group.
[02:19:21] Talk to that group and you're saying no, I don't want to talk to you.
[02:19:23] Don't want to talk to anybody.
[02:19:24] Don't want to talk to anybody.
[02:19:25] And finally, you get asked one more time and I'll go to the book.
[02:19:29] I just want to ask you please to consider one last time.
[02:19:33] This group is the Baton Corrigan or Survivors Association and they really want one of the
[02:19:38] returned Vietnam POWs to talk to them at their gathering tonight.
[02:19:44] You're the only one still here.
[02:19:46] I was blown away.
[02:19:47] Wait a minute.
[02:19:48] These are POWs who survived the Baton Death March and World War II and they want to hear
[02:19:52] about me after what they've been through.
[02:19:55] And of course, you agree to do it and this is the part that I wanted especially the
[02:20:00] Vets because a lot of Vets listen to this.
[02:20:04] By giving me an opportunity I couldn't refuse, they made me come out of my shell and speak
[02:20:09] publicly about what I'd been through.
[02:20:12] They opened the door to what would become the greatest therapy possible to help me deal with
[02:20:17] all that had happened to me.
[02:20:19] Many of my friends who have not been able to talk about what had happened to them have not
[02:20:25] re-adjusted well.
[02:20:26] Several still have major psychological issues haunting them.
[02:20:31] A couple of days later I got an invitation to speak to a high school assembly which I accepted.
[02:20:36] In the weeks and months ahead I'd be asked to talk to various groups and I'd agreed
[02:20:41] to do as many as I could.
[02:20:43] I strongly believe that the opportunity to share my experience has been one of the principal
[02:20:48] reasons I've been able to readjust and deal with life as well as I have.
[02:20:53] That coupled with my faith in God, love of family and my inherently optimistic nature.
[02:21:00] Yes, yes, yes.
[02:21:04] I can't.
[02:21:06] That is probably the greatest bit of advice that comes out of this book.
[02:21:12] I mean I came back.
[02:21:13] I didn't want to talk to anybody.
[02:21:14] I didn't think anybody could understand what I had to say and I think many vets have the
[02:21:20] same feeling.
[02:21:21] Just leave me alone.
[02:21:23] I will get through this and plus you don't know what I would have experienced and you
[02:21:28] can't understand if I try to tell you about it.
[02:21:32] First of all they can understand to a degree.
[02:21:34] No one will ever be able to understand everything that you've been through but they can
[02:21:37] understand to a degree and they do want to listen.
[02:21:39] Okay, that's the receiving end.
[02:21:41] For you to be able to share your experience.
[02:21:45] And for me over the years to share my experience again and again and again and even to write
[02:21:52] this book as painful as that process was is a therapeutic process.
[02:21:57] It's a healing process to be able to talk about what you've experienced.
[02:22:01] And if you think you have demons in your mind share those demons too.
[02:22:05] Talk about it.
[02:22:06] It certainly has helped me.
[02:22:07] And I'm doing well. I've been through a lot. I'm doing well and I think a huge part of
[02:22:13] that reason is thank you survivors of botanic rigotor because I couldn't say no to you.
[02:22:20] And by doing that it got me started talking about my experience.
[02:22:25] It's totally agree.
[02:22:26] I totally agree.
[02:22:27] It's a beautiful advice.
[02:22:31] And to close out the story here, you say in the book that you greet your children at
[02:22:39] the time, you greet your children every day with good morning.
[02:22:43] It's a beautiful day.
[02:22:46] And you explain why you do that in the book.
[02:22:52] And I quote, I truly believe that every day God has given me on this earth since I came
[02:22:59] home from captivity is a beautiful day.
[02:23:04] It doesn't matter if it's raining or snowing, windy or calm, hot or cold, sunny or
[02:23:11] overcast.
[02:23:14] Every day is a gift.
[02:23:18] Every day is beautiful.
[02:23:24] And that is certainly something that I learned in war.
[02:23:29] Not as vividly as you did by any stretch.
[02:23:33] But definitely something that I know to be true and something that I talk about all the
[02:23:38] time here.
[02:23:40] That when you see that darkness, the light is much more beautiful.
[02:23:54] And you put together in this book, the eight steps to survival in a few days.
[02:24:04] And those I wrote right after I got back, the book was written just in the last several
[02:24:10] years with those eight steps for survival.
[02:24:11] I put those to paper shortly after I returned.
[02:24:14] And what I love about these is as I read through them here, they're not just for survival
[02:24:20] in a POW camp.
[02:24:22] They're for life.
[02:24:23] They're for life.
[02:24:24] They've been tested in the absolute harshest of conditions in a POW camp, but they
[02:24:30] can be applied to life.
[02:24:32] And it's actually things I talk about all the time.
[02:24:36] And it's amazing that they are so much alignment.
[02:24:41] Number one, e.
[02:24:44] Sound simple, doesn't it?
[02:24:46] But when you've got a forestown, nothing but plain boiled rice day after day, month after
[02:24:50] month, EDD comes a difficult chore.
[02:24:53] And I'm found death easier.
[02:24:57] Now how does that apply to life for me?
[02:25:00] Eat the right food, eat healthy foods, boom, done.
[02:25:06] You want to stay healthy.
[02:25:10] Next one, practice personal hygiene.
[02:25:13] When you are sick and starving, it's hard to motivate yourself to keep your body and
[02:25:16] surroundings clean.
[02:25:18] Do the best you can with what you have.
[02:25:22] No fleets to disease and disease leads to death.
[02:25:28] And again, for me to apply this to life, this is about discipline and this is about routine.
[02:25:36] And this is about pride and maintaining those things.
[02:25:42] And even, you know, we've talked about one of those stories I talk about on here is the
[02:25:46] Russians fighting the chasions and one of the things that in the debriefs and the post-operational
[02:25:51] debriefs when they lost that first push down there.
[02:25:55] They said, you know, once the guy stopped shaving, right?
[02:25:58] Then they stopped taking care of the weapons and everything goes downhill.
[02:26:01] So what, to me, one of the things that this applies to, I mean, you're talking about it
[02:26:04] from also from a pure health perspective.
[02:26:08] Obviously.
[02:26:09] But it's also psychological factors.
[02:26:10] Yes.
[02:26:11] Yes.
[02:26:13] Number three exercise.
[02:26:17] Set up a daily exercise period.
[02:26:19] Do something.
[02:26:21] And if you are in stocks and chains, you can at least flex a few muscles and do some
[02:26:27] deep breathing.
[02:26:28] Okay.
[02:26:29] There is no more excuses ever, ever for not working out, for not doing something physical.
[02:26:38] Even if you're in stock, AIDS and chains.
[02:26:43] Yeah, not in a recliner with a TV.
[02:26:49] Believeable.
[02:26:52] Do not give up the fight to stay alive.
[02:26:54] This is number four.
[02:26:55] Do not give up this fight to stay alive.
[02:26:57] No matter how sick you are, how serious you wounds or how hopeless the situation is, there's
[02:27:02] always a chance you can make it.
[02:27:04] Take that chance with your deepest courage, fight for it.
[02:27:09] Then again, you'll apply this every day.
[02:27:12] Look at the opportunities you have.
[02:27:14] I mean, the opportunities that a normal person has.
[02:27:18] We don't even take advantage of those opportunities that we have.
[02:27:21] We don't even fight for those.
[02:27:22] Fight for those.
[02:27:27] Number five, establish communications with other prisoners.
[02:27:30] Use your initiative and imagination to make contact with others and then develop a chain
[02:27:35] of command.
[02:27:38] Build relationships with people.
[02:27:40] No.
[02:27:41] Build relationships with people.
[02:27:45] Number six, follow the code of conduct.
[02:27:49] You must know the code before you find yourself in a prison camp.
[02:27:53] Then you should adhere to the articles as strictly as possible.
[02:27:59] That doesn't mean it here perfectly.
[02:28:01] Because no one can adhere perfectly.
[02:28:03] But adhere as close as possible.
[02:28:05] If you waiver, come back to it.
[02:28:07] Don't waiver and think that you've failed and then just cave in and give in.
[02:28:13] That's one of the things again we were talking on the way over here.
[02:28:17] That was one of the changes after the experiences that you all had is what initiated those
[02:28:21] changes in the code of conduct to give it some flexibility.
[02:28:26] So that people could bounce back from and say, oh, you know, yesterday didn't make it.
[02:28:31] Today is a new day.
[02:28:33] I think that attitude is perfect for everyday life.
[02:28:37] You fall off the wagon on something.
[02:28:38] Okay.
[02:28:39] That doesn't get back on it.
[02:28:41] Number seven, keep the faith.
[02:28:47] Faith in your family, your religion and your country may be all that keeps you alive and
[02:28:53] sane.
[02:28:54] Hang in there.
[02:28:56] You are not forgotten.
[02:29:02] That needs no explanation.
[02:29:04] And number eight, maintain a sense of humor.
[02:29:12] This is difficult, but both possible and necessary.
[02:29:17] A bit of humor helps keep away fits of total depression.
[02:29:23] And remember, depression can kill.
[02:29:28] So yes.
[02:29:29] And I'd practice what I've preached by my poor family and close friends.
[02:29:34] Oh, my very crazy six cents a year.
[02:29:36] But I do have one.
[02:29:38] And I did, throughout, and I give a couple examples in the book where it's a very
[02:29:41] dire times, I would come up with a stupidest humor.
[02:29:44] But I'd like to tell you.
[02:29:47] Well, I've talked about that as well.
[02:29:49] And we would be in the worst situations possible.
[02:29:52] And always someone would be laughing about something.
[02:29:55] And that's what, like you said, that's what keeps the spirit going and keeps you on
[02:30:00] the same side of things as to have fun with it.
[02:30:04] Is there anything that any points that I missed?
[02:30:07] I mean, again, I know I missed a lot of points.
[02:30:10] Anything else that you would recommend or you wanted to bring up?
[02:30:15] I don't think you missed anything, Jack.
[02:30:17] You covered the book very thoroughly.
[02:30:21] The title is Through the Valley, My Captivity and Vietnam.
[02:30:24] And I'm saying that because I hope that this book will be of benefit and value to others.
[02:30:33] And that's really what drove me to finish the book.
[02:30:35] I started it.
[02:30:36] And I was wondering why I was writing it.
[02:30:37] But I think when the whole thing is put together, it's a story of hope and the power of hope
[02:30:43] and how anyone can face very adverse conditions, challenges in life.
[02:30:49] Be they guys coming back with PTSD from combat, be it just a single mother somewhere with
[02:30:56] problems, others with difficulties.
[02:30:58] I think in reading this book, you can come out of it with hope.
[02:31:03] And hopefully with motivation to overcome those difficulties and have a full, wonderful and
[02:31:12] beautiful life because it is a beautiful thing.
[02:31:15] If we'll just grab a hold of that beauty and go for it and not dwell on whatever negative
[02:31:20] aspects there might be.
[02:31:23] There's no doubt.
[02:31:24] And even though I did a may have done a thorough job, I read less than 10%, much less than
[02:31:31] 10%.
[02:31:32] There's so much more that you went through that you experienced and the other people that
[02:31:37] you talk about who went through what they went through.
[02:31:42] It's a phenomenal book.
[02:31:44] It's a phenomenal book through the Valley, my captivity and Vietnam.
[02:31:47] There'll be a link for it.
[02:31:49] Yes.
[02:31:50] So you can go to the website and get right and get it ordered.
[02:31:55] You guys know the deal.
[02:31:56] Do it quick.
[02:31:57] So you made a copy.
[02:31:58] Yes, I should add one thing because we talked about a lot of the negative stuff in the
[02:32:01] book.
[02:32:02] It does have a happy ending.
[02:32:03] The happy ending at the end of this book is Melanie Ross Reader, my wife.
[02:32:09] And that the love story is in there and how we came together.
[02:32:13] But she and then the two younger kids we talked about Spencer and Vicki, but also Chad and
[02:32:19] Chelsea have brought such a joy to my life and brought this whole journey to a conclusion.
[02:32:25] So there's the power of hope and there's also the power of love that comes out at the end
[02:32:30] of this.
[02:32:31] It's absolutely, it's beautiful.
[02:32:34] It's a great book.
[02:32:37] And I can't even begin to express how appreciative that we are for you coming here and sharing
[02:32:45] the story with us, your determination, and your heroism.
[02:32:50] I could literally sit here and listen to you indefinitely.
[02:32:56] And so thank you.
[02:32:58] I know you have worked to attend to and I dragged you out here when you're already working
[02:33:04] hard.
[02:33:06] Thanks to you, thanks to your cousin Ryan Summers who actually contacted us through the
[02:33:13] interwebs and linked us up together.
[02:33:15] So thanks to Ryan for doing that, appreciate it and actually echo speaking of the interwebs.
[02:33:22] If anybody wants to support this podcast, is there any way that they could do that?
[02:33:27] Yes.
[02:33:28] A little bit, actually one question.
[02:33:29] We're going to go back with broken.
[02:33:31] Thank you.
[02:33:32] Lower back.
[02:33:33] Yeah, TL1, T12, L2 all in there.
[02:33:38] I'm few as I was, well we didn't get it all my surgeries after him back, but I'm all
[02:33:42] fused together and wired together in my back.
[02:33:45] I was going to ask what did you eat the whole time, but just rice on the whole time?
[02:33:49] Well, I'll tell you I got to hand over and then I said the bean sprouts was ready.
[02:33:52] What I found is they keep that diet for about three weeks running.
[02:33:56] So I had nothing of a bean sprouts both times away for three weeks, then we get pumpkin soup,
[02:34:00] cabbage soup, Corabi and Corabi is the only thing I don't really care for.
[02:34:06] Since I came to love rice actually, but that was partly psychological because I had to eat
[02:34:09] it.
[02:34:10] So I do truly love rice today.
[02:34:12] That's kind of vegetarian diet.
[02:34:15] More or less.
[02:34:16] Yeah, yeah.
[02:34:17] My cholesterol was very low on the diet.
[02:34:19] Yeah, yeah.
[02:34:20] Yeah, yeah.
[02:34:21] Okay.
[02:34:22] Yes, interwebs.
