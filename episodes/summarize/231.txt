Okay, you said that you don't do like a, like a, like a joker or like a faint or anything like that, you know, go one way and then break right or whatever. and I said it, you know, as soon as he left, as soon as Dan left, I was like, oh, we're going to have to go deep on this stuff day because the better, you know, the better I can understand what it looked like from your perspective, I think it just opens up a better understanding of this whole mentality. But like even, you know, even when I was a cartoon commander and something would happen, some, some other, you know, whether it was, whether it was the enemy, whether it was some part of some organization, you know, some person that had something, did something that was, I don't, I want to throw this word out there because it just, it just sets off a whole bunch of, you know, what could it be? And then we're going to swirl around a little bit, and then I'm going to see an opportunity like, oh, oh, oh, oh, juggle gave me a little bit of room here. You know, it's kind of like a thing like I'm going to grill up. And you know what a good turn looks like, then you know what a weak turn looks like. So you've got to think about your fuel, you've got to think about your wingmen, you've got to think about the other 20 airplanes that are going to be landing on the ship at the same time as you, and the coordination goes along with that. That's kind of like guys like in the Air Force guys like Robin Oles or such legends, because in the face of an entire industry and in the face of an entire era of the military mindset, he recognized that the thing that makes us better is how well we train and how aggressive we are with our machines. I think because of the, because of the reaction of an aircraft, if you're going to fake enough that I'm going to actually have to fall for your fake, for you to recover back is you can't do it quickly enough and I am going to be able to take advantage of it. Then I need to draw what's up there and then I'm going to put some big circles in the boring go, hey, we're going to really analyze this engagement here and I'm going to play the tape and go, okay, stop, what do you see? How about, um, how about eyesight, which I know back in the day was like the component Chuck Yager, you know, could like PID, Yeah, bogeys, just so before anyone is even close to seeing them. You might get a little, not sure right for line up left, you might have a different version of going right, and then there is going left. But you're not going to come up with like, oh, man, I'm going to come up with some crazy thing that's never seen before. And I think one of the cool things about being around the ship, and one of the things that makes naval aviation unique with these guys in the Navy and the Marines that did it, is that every single flight, there was this risk, there was this fight that you were going to get the duel against this machine, this boat, this thing that's out there, that sort of geared and designed in every way, shape, and form, it's a really bad airport. But then yes, you got to remember as well that there is no, because essentially like, okay, like you're in a duty to remember where it's like Green zone meaning save zone if you're too far away from the guy you can't punch a kick you whatever. I think the way you said it was exactly right man, so F-18, F-16, F-15, MIG-29, SC-27, all these airplanes in this generational world that I was in at top, going to during that time, they're all pretty good. Can you like not become a fighter pilot if your vision is like a, you know, used to be like that. And so the key would be is, how can I maneuver to a place where I can climb above you without putting myself at risk to your weapons, and then maneuver above you, and take advantage of that free G force that's available to me going from high to low, where you're fighting against that and you're losing it, going from low to high, and that's kind of the goal of that vertical fight that he described. You've got to plan for it, you've got to count for it, you've got to manage your fuel for it, and you've got to recognize that more than likely, the hardest part of your flight, no matter what you're doing, more often than not, it's going to be the last thing you do. But if you don't really know what's happening around you the way that he does, eventually he's going to out, he's going to outperform you. So you get the nod you go when you when you show up there, do you have any inkling in your head that you're going to do well that you're going to be able to hang you're just like you took no 100% that you're getting in with the black and with the sharks and with the black belts. And it's not going to keep working like this because the people we're fighting against are going to figure this out. The fleet is cyclical, so you have a work up phase and you have focus on this work up and you have deployment phase and that's a huge amount of focus and you come back and you kind of have, you know, a little bit of a let down phase, you lose some people they go well, so where you get some new people on board and it cycles and the pace cycles up and down, the responsibility cycle up and down, what you're trying to do changes all the time. The LSOs and look, one of the cool things, or is it like power power power, break, break, break, break, break, like a left left left left, is you doing that? You steer everything with your legs, you're putting a lot of pressure on your feet and your toes and you maneuver the airplane with your feet and your legs are shaking so hard that you literally can't steer and you're margined for like they take it to the side of the ship like three feet away from the edge of the ship. How much do you use a change of pace, like in basketball, you know, when you're dribbling down the court, you change pace, you go, you, you're going fast, then you slow down for second, then you go fast again. But if you're on the pat, you know, if you're if you are reminded that, hey, you're going by this code, you throw up a zero by that hurts, you know? He's going to be able to excel in in this and he's going to do a little better better than jockel because I can see jockel is kind of lagging in his ability to. Like I'm holding your hands instead of like I got one hand here, one hand here, I'm holding you tight, you can't like maneuver it all. Now it's like, man, I don't know how this is going to, now you're in a real fight. But typically when you strap on an airplane, you have a pretty good idea of how it's going to perform and how it's going to behave. If you're an hour going out there and I'm just going to, and I just start getting wild with you and just turn to some of these crazy things. You know, if you can identify those two, because it reveals that you actually know what's going on. And you're just going to add some moment boom, you're going to turn left, right, whatever. You didn't know that there are soldiers already left the building and you didn't see where you didn't know the stuff was going on. I don't mean it like you like to fight other people but that feeling that you get you like that feeling. So if you compare to the jujitsu, right, you know how like we have situational training, which is essentially what it is, right, situational training. It is a reminder because like a lot of this stuff is like, yeah, like you could have a one day. And you know, like I said, it's, it's, you know, it's an old man talking now and just don't get those situations very often. It's like, oh, I mean, in your jitz who I'd say, hey, echo, you know, you're, you need to get you, you squeeze your knees together, right on an armlock. And you know, you don't know what's going to happen. And I won't really know what that debrief is going to be like until we get in there. Like I know what you're going into this seal training. But if you've got, you know, if you did the math that we've got, multiple carriers, deployed to see it all the time, and you're doing multiple flight ups all the time, once a week out there somewhere in the blue ocean, there's a kid up there who's struggling.
