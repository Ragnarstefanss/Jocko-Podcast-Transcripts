[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 138.
[00:00:05] With echo Charles and me, Jockel willing.
[00:00:08] Good evening, I go.
[00:00:09] Good evening.
[00:00:12] Sir, the young seal whispered in a faint voice.
[00:00:18] Come here.
[00:00:20] Our hands were clasped in hand shake.
[00:00:24] On a formal handshake like two businessmen, but palm to palm with thumbs wrapped around
[00:00:30] the back of the hand like an arm wrestling contest, a handshake of brotherhood.
[00:00:38] The young seal was feeling the morphine.
[00:00:41] I saw it as eyes, but he was still there.
[00:00:45] Still conscious and aware.
[00:00:48] He was everything a young man should be smart, brave, athletic, funny, loyal and tough.
[00:00:58] He had been shot in the leg about a half an hour before.
[00:01:03] I found out later that Mikey Montsour, a young seal machine gunner, had run out into heavy
[00:01:08] enemy gunfire and drag this seal out of a war torn street in the Malab district in the city
[00:01:14] of Ramadi, the violent heart of the insurgency in Iraq.
[00:01:20] The wounded seal now lay on a gurney and Charlie Medd, the camp Ramadi field hospital
[00:01:27] where US military surgical teams worked furiously to save the lives of gravely wounded
[00:01:32] troops almost every day.
[00:01:36] The bullet, a mammoth armor piercing 7.62 by 54 millimeter round with a steel core, had entered
[00:01:45] his leg at the lower thigh, ripped the part flesh and bone inside his leg and exited in
[00:01:51] his upper thigh close to the groin.
[00:01:56] It was hard to say if he would keep his leg from the looks of the wound.
[00:02:02] My guess was no.
[00:02:05] He would lose it.
[00:02:09] The wounded seals grip on my hand tightened and he pulled me in, drawing me just inches
[00:02:15] from his face.
[00:02:18] I could tell he wanted to say something to me so I turned and put my ear to his next to his
[00:02:24] mouth.
[00:02:26] I wasn't sure what to expect.
[00:02:30] Was he scared or angry or depressed that he might lose his leg?
[00:02:35] Was he nervous about what might happen next?
[00:02:37] Was he confused?
[00:02:42] He took a breath and then whispered, sir, let me stay.
[00:02:50] Let me stay.
[00:02:51] Please don't make me go home.
[00:02:53] I'll do anything.
[00:02:54] I'll sweep up around the camp.
[00:02:55] I can heal here.
[00:02:57] Please.
[00:02:58] Please.
[00:02:59] Please stay with the task unit.
[00:03:04] There you go.
[00:03:07] Not scared, not angry, not depressed that he might lose his leg.
[00:03:15] Only concerned that he might have to leave our task unit.
[00:03:21] Task unit bruiser.
[00:03:23] Our task unit.
[00:03:25] Our lives.
[00:03:28] This seal was our first significant casualty.
[00:03:33] We had had guys catch some frag on previous operations.
[00:03:36] We had had some very close calls.
[00:03:40] This was the first seal wounded from task unit bruiser whose life would be forever changed
[00:03:45] by a grave combat injury.
[00:03:49] Even if he kept his leg, the damage was so substantial that it didn't seem possible
[00:03:54] he would ever fully regain the extraordinary athleticism he had displayed previously.
[00:04:02] And yet this seal was only concerned that he would let me down.
[00:04:07] Let the task unit down, let his platoon and his team down.
[00:04:16] This was a man.
[00:04:20] This was a true friend of brother.
[00:04:26] This was a hero.
[00:04:29] Young, brave, and without question, more concerned for his friends than for his own life.
[00:04:41] I was moved.
[00:04:45] I felt tears wailing up in my eyes.
[00:04:47] I fought them back, then I swallowed the lump in my throat.
[00:04:55] This was no time to break down.
[00:04:59] I was supposed to be the leader.
[00:05:05] And he needed me to be strong.
[00:05:15] And that right there is from the opening chapter of a book called The Dicotomy of Leadership,
[00:05:26] which is actually a new book.
[00:05:28] And it was written by me and my brother, Lave Babin, and Lave has been on this podcast
[00:05:38] before.
[00:05:39] We wrote extreme ownership together.
[00:05:41] We obviously served in task unit, bruiser together.
[00:05:46] And he was on this podcast.
[00:05:49] He was the first guest.
[00:05:50] He's been the guest the most times.
[00:05:54] He was on 11.
[00:05:55] He was on 34, 65, and 11, 14.
[00:05:58] If you want to go get some background on Lave, but I'm glad to say that he is actually back
[00:06:05] here with us again.
[00:06:07] It's a Lave Babin.
[00:06:09] Welcome back.
[00:06:10] It's going to be back.
[00:06:11] Thanks for having me on.
[00:06:13] Yeah, right home, man.
[00:06:14] And it's good to have you back because we're done writing and editing this book, which
[00:06:21] feels good.
[00:06:22] It does feel good.
[00:06:23] It's been a lot of work, but it's been awesome, too.
[00:06:27] And to be able to tell this kind of stories, I can just read.
[00:06:29] And even though I've read that now a hundred times, it just takes me immediately back
[00:06:35] to that situation.
[00:06:38] And it's just extraordinary.
[00:06:41] We were able to work with some incredible, incredible seals like that young man.
[00:06:45] Yeah, no doubt about it.
[00:06:49] It's weird when you're writing a book.
[00:06:52] And then you're rereading it and rereading it.
[00:06:55] And like you said, every time I would be reading these sections, you just get that, you
[00:07:02] just can't help but go back there.
[00:07:04] You just can't help but go back there.
[00:07:05] And this was definitely there were some parts of this book.
[00:07:07] And I was writing that were definitely hard to write and even hard to edit.
[00:07:14] You know, this, this being wonderful.
[00:07:16] And I'm glad that we're able to share the stories of guys like that.
[00:07:22] And that particular individual, which I don't talk about this in the book, but he kept
[00:07:28] his leg, thank God.
[00:07:30] And he kept getting after it for years and years.
[00:07:37] And he kept training Jiu Jitsu and he's a total stud maybe sometime.
[00:07:41] He'll come on the podcast, who knows?
[00:07:43] But what a great guy.
[00:07:46] Now you also kind of kicked off the book with what I thought was a solid way to kick it off.
[00:07:56] And you should go into that.
[00:07:58] I know we were trying to pick out some good sections here, but I thought the opener that
[00:08:02] you put in, which you opened with the phrase that we've been using quite a bit lately.
[00:08:06] But kick off that introduction to the book, dichotomy leadership.
[00:08:16] Stand by to get some.
[00:08:17] Said someone over the inner squad radio and the calm demeanor, you might expect a
[00:08:22] bit of a flight attendant telling airline passengers to stow their tray tables for landing.
[00:08:27] The street and front of us had emptied of people.
[00:08:30] Like magic, the local citizens had all suddenly disappeared.
[00:08:34] And we knew what that meant.
[00:08:35] Enemy attack was imminent.
[00:08:38] The hair on the back of my neck stood at rigid attention.
[00:08:42] After many eviscious gunfighting Romadi, standby to get some was a running joke that
[00:08:46] eased attention right when we knew trouble was coming.
[00:08:49] The more nonchalantly it could be said, under the diarist of circumstances, the funnier
[00:08:54] it was.
[00:08:56] It was broad daylight as our patrol of seals and Iraqi soldiers made its way on foot
[00:09:01] down the narrow city street, bordered by high concrete walls on both sides.
[00:09:06] Suddenly the world exploded.
[00:09:09] Dozens of bullets snap to the air, each with a sharp, supersonic crack, and smashed into
[00:09:14] the concrete wall next to me with thunderous impact.
[00:09:17] The yards of concrete flew everywhere.
[00:09:20] The heavy valleys of incoming fire sounded like multiple jack-hammers simultaneously
[00:09:24] chewing up the street and the walls all around us.
[00:09:28] We had walked right into an enemy bus saw.
[00:09:32] In surgeon fighters hit us from multiple directions with belt fed machine guns.
[00:09:35] I couldn't see them or where they were shooting from.
[00:09:38] But the number of enemy bullets flying to the air around us was crazy.
[00:09:44] There was no place to hide, with high walls on both sides, the narrow south center of
[00:09:48] a mighty street provided no cover.
[00:09:51] The only thing between us and the enemy machine guns was a single parked car on the
[00:09:55] side of the road some distance up the block and the typical trash thrown about.
[00:10:01] The patrol was in a dual column formation.
[00:10:03] Each column split on opposite sides of the street, hookered close to the walls.
[00:10:08] There was nothing to get behind that could protect us from bullets.
[00:10:11] But we did have something on our side, devastating firepower.
[00:10:15] We fully expected a firefighter on every patrol into this enemy hill neighborhood and
[00:10:20] we rolled in heavy.
[00:10:21] Each squad of eight seals packed at least four belt fed machine guns to suppress any enemy
[00:10:26] attack we encountered.
[00:10:28] When we came under fire, our immediate response with violent and overwhelming gunfire provided
[00:10:33] the only answer.
[00:10:35] Cover and move.
[00:10:36] Having learned through the humbling experience of months of urban combat, task unit
[00:10:40] rooser had had plenty of practice in this fundamental gun fighting principle.
[00:10:45] Within nanoseconds, the seals with a big machine guns up front, unleash the most ruthless
[00:10:50] and lethal barrage of fire you can imagine.
[00:10:53] Despite the intensity and violence of the closer urban combat, I couldn't help but smile.
[00:11:01] Couldn't help but smile.
[00:11:02] Yeah, that's we've said this before, but obviously guys that have been too war usually
[00:11:06] that's the best thing in their life and the best experiences they've found in their lives
[00:11:09] and it gives you that type of feeling right there of where you can't help but smile.
[00:11:15] Then as I just talked about it and as we both know, it's also the worst days of our lives
[00:11:20] are also there and we know that people in the military all feel most of them feel the same
[00:11:26] way that you have your best days and your worst days there.
[00:11:33] It's interesting.
[00:11:36] Over and move, it always comes back to cover and move in these gun fights and you know
[00:11:41] a client we were working with recently and you know remember he switched around, cover
[00:11:46] and move and made it a second and put simple first and it's like well there's a reason
[00:11:53] why that exists that way cover move is first because if you're not working together
[00:11:57] there's a team there's nothing to even keep simple.
[00:11:59] That's not happening.
[00:12:00] You need to start off with cover move teamwork is critical and obviously we just read a
[00:12:07] couple of sort of war story-ish type things but like extreme ownership this book's kind
[00:12:13] of set up the same way as extreme ownership.
[00:12:15] I mean, oh, not kind of it is set up the same way as extreme ownership which is a story
[00:12:21] about combat that reveals a principle and then actually state what the principle is and
[00:12:29] then we use a business example that shows how this principle applies in civilian life and
[00:12:36] usually in the business world.
[00:12:37] In fact, always in the business world that's those examples that we use although we could
[00:12:42] probably do another book that was about how these principles apply to your under nine
[00:12:48] year old soccer team or your relationship with your spouse or your relationship with your
[00:12:55] teenage daughters to of them or your relationship with your teenage son or one of them
[00:13:02] or your relationship with your nine year old daughter or your what do you got three
[00:13:07] and four and three and a two year old.
[00:13:09] Yeah, get some absolutely.
[00:13:10] It could absolutely apply to any of those situations.
[00:13:13] I think that was that was was amazing about extreme ownership to see how people apply
[00:13:18] that in so many aspects of their lives and now I think with the economy leadership it's
[00:13:22] exactly the same thing.
[00:13:23] Yeah.
[00:13:24] And it applies across all aspects of a professional and personal life.
[00:13:28] Well, it was your two because when when you know when I got out of the teams like I
[00:13:31] didn't understand I didn't understand the broad application of what we knew.
[00:13:36] I didn't I mean when I started working with civilian companies then it's like oh well this
[00:13:39] is your problem you don't keep things simple enough or this is your problem you don't
[00:13:42] have decentralized commands so you're trying to control all the decision make it's but as soon
[00:13:46] as we realized and I realized it was like oh it applies to this company what about
[00:13:50] this company and okay what about this company and you just realize okay and that's when
[00:13:53] I started just seeing it everywhere and and I think yeah exactly right the dichotomy
[00:13:58] leadership is the same way and it well like I said it's not just a book of war stories
[00:14:05] the point of the book is to make people better leaders is to give them leadership tools
[00:14:11] including me including you like when you write stuff down you understand it better and
[00:14:18] so you know part of writing these books is like okay how can I capture these lessons
[00:14:23] for myself and of course it's nice that other people can grab them then and look through
[00:14:28] them but like I said it's not it's not just about war stories but to make people better
[00:14:32] leaders and I think I think we covered that pretty well in sort of in the intro of the
[00:14:38] book and just a couple paragraphs and you should hit that part that we talked about earlier
[00:14:44] where it just kind of gives the overall the overall view or the the high level view of the
[00:14:50] topic of the book every behavior or characteristic carried out by a leader can be taken
[00:14:55] too far leaders can become too extreme and upset the balance required to effectively lead
[00:15:01] a team when balance is lost leadership suffers and the teens performance rapidly declines
[00:15:07] even the fundamental principles of combat leadership and extreme ownership can get out
[00:15:13] of balance a leader can cover and move too much and step on the toes of other leaders
[00:15:18] departments or divisions a plan can be too simple and failed to cover likely
[00:15:22] the contingencies a team could go too far with prioritizing execute resulting in target
[00:15:28] fixation and loss of situational awareness on newly emerging problems and threats even
[00:15:34] destabilize command can be taken too far when too much autonomy is given to support
[00:15:38] leaders who then don't fully understand strategic goals and how to execute and support
[00:15:43] those goals and this idea continues on but just about everything a leader does leaders must
[00:15:49] be close with their people but not too close that it becomes a problem they must hold
[00:15:53] the line with discipline but they must not become tyrannical a leader can even become too
[00:15:59] extreme with extreme ownership when a leader takes so much ownership of everything in his
[00:16:04] or her world that members of the team feel there's nothing left for which they can take
[00:16:08] ownership when this happens team members will execute only at the boss's specific direction
[00:16:14] without any route ownership or buy in themselves resulting in a team far less capable
[00:16:20] of overcoming obstacles and accomplish in the mission therefore balance and leadership
[00:16:25] is crucial to victory you can't say that one enough and you literally can't say that one
[00:16:32] enough I would think so when you have the same word to many time on times on a page it's
[00:16:38] it's not good writing right it's not good use the same word over and over again so
[00:16:43] I remember there was times where we would have the word balance like nine times in a paragraph
[00:16:47] but there's it's like hey there's no real other way to say what we're trying to say you got
[00:16:51] a balance these things and it's interesting too as as as you're reading that I'm just thinking
[00:16:56] of all the different situations we've been in in the last few years with echelon front
[00:17:01] where we've seen every single one of these things you know the person that comes up
[00:17:07] hey we want to keep this plan simple and then they don't think of any contingencies or hey
[00:17:11] I'm just trying to cover and move and that means I'm going to do the job for them and
[00:17:14] all of a sudden they're making everyone mad because they're stepping on everyone toes I mean
[00:17:17] decentralized command we're no one knows what's going on because it's okay I'm our hands off
[00:17:22] leader I'm using decentralized command but boss what in God's name you actually want us to do
[00:17:28] so all these things are we've lived we've lived film now and it became really evident
[00:17:34] even though we have you know it's the last chapter the last chapter in extreme ownership is the
[00:17:38] dichotomy leadership and discipline equals freedom and you know we put it in there because we knew
[00:17:43] it was important but now after working with more people over the past few years it's become so obvious
[00:17:49] that this is like such a critical the being able to balance balance balance balance I
[00:17:55] use that word nine times in every paragraph because that's what you have to do if you're a leader
[00:18:00] and and we talk about this too and the opening of in the opening of the book and you know in
[00:18:06] the opening of dichotomy leadership we talk about how one of the problems with the book
[00:18:11] extreme ownership is the title extreme ownership because it made everyone just want to get
[00:18:16] extraordinary with everything I'm going to be super extreme and so that means you know what I'm
[00:18:21] going to do but get extreme on our own everything and we that was one of the earliest things that I
[00:18:25] started noticing was people that took so much ownership so on the leader I'm in charge and I take
[00:18:30] so much ownership of everything that everyone below me in the chain of command there's nothing
[00:18:35] left for them to own and and all of a sudden they're just feeling like hey they're just along
[00:18:38] for the ride and they're just going to do what they're told to do and all their initiatives gone and
[00:18:42] they don't they don't even have they don't they don't it's not that they don't believe but they
[00:18:47] just think okay well it's going to do it what we're told so it's not their plan and so they're going
[00:18:51] to do the best their ability but it's not theirs they don't own it so all those things that you
[00:18:56] just talked about are our things that we've we've now seen and there are things that I struggle with
[00:19:01] you know I think there's there are things that you struggle I think we each of us struggle with them
[00:19:04] it's the hardest part about leadership and as we've seen that over and over again that you know
[00:19:09] that brief introduction that we gave it in chapter 12 of extreme ownership you know introduce the
[00:19:15] concept but this dives so much deeper into those challenges and I think that's what what I
[00:19:20] know about this book is it answers the the questions to that that we get most often about
[00:19:26] about how to balance that because that's the hardest part and it's so difficult to do and I
[00:19:31] remember it our first master there was a question about you know can you take you know can
[00:19:35] extreme ownership go too far I actually answer the question well I think if you're properly
[00:19:40] understanding what extreme ownership means no but you actually answer that as I was like yes
[00:19:45] you can take too much ownership and I think that's what people take that is well I've got to do
[00:19:50] everything like no you you're responsible for everything that's what extreme ownership means but
[00:19:54] certainly you can you can absolutely take too much ownership where no one's doing anything and I
[00:19:58] think we explained that pretty well in this book and this this book was written just like
[00:20:03] extreme ownership that economy leadership was written to help leaders as a reference manual and
[00:20:08] and if it's something that you know if I see pages like we see so many cops of extreme ownership
[00:20:13] I mean I want to see pages that are underlined that are highlighted they're tab that are
[00:20:16] they're utilized by leaders and and if we've done that and this is a manual that helps
[00:20:22] leaders lead better and be better people and lead better teams that then this will have
[00:20:26] a accomplishes mission you know what's cool is is I think it's very similar to the fact that
[00:20:30] with extreme ownership right with that attitude with that attitude when you get in that mindset
[00:20:36] you start seeing it everywhere and you start when someone makes an excuse you recognize
[00:20:42] me that you go that's an excuse like echo is giving you a hard time about your your lack of a
[00:20:47] haircut and and you know you were you were saying that I was my fault and we're laughing about it right
[00:20:54] and and of course I was I was like well you know I should have told you you know there's
[00:20:58] gonna be a timeline and you need to get haircut before but you know we're joking about it but
[00:21:03] in the same time that we're joking about it the fact that like you brought that echo that up
[00:21:08] is a real thing and for us to be sitting here joking about it means that we actually think about it
[00:21:12] we actually every time you know you know laves making it a joke and excuse like oh juggling he's
[00:21:18] it's like we all know and it's it's it's a it's a it's syncs in and it becomes really like for
[00:21:25] someone to make an actual excuse becomes really really hard and I think for me that's one thing that
[00:21:32] I've benefited over the last few years of seeing other people what you it's it becomes when you're
[00:21:38] aware of it when you're aware of it the balance becomes much much easier to see and that's what
[00:21:43] I think is gonna be very helpful about this book is people won't know that they're out of balance
[00:21:47] that's the biggest problem a big problem is they don't know they're thinking my my guys are
[00:21:51] taking any initiative what's wrong with them and it's like well your micro managing them you've
[00:21:55] gone too far in that direction you've gone too far in controlling everything that they do they think
[00:22:00] that that's they think that if you want them to do something that you're gonna tell them to do it
[00:22:04] and other than that they're gonna sit there and stand by a wait for orders and it's like no
[00:22:08] so and you if you don't understand that you can be out of balance then you won't recognize that
[00:22:14] but if you know hey my guys aren't taking in any initiative I wonder what's wrong with them
[00:22:20] well actually maybe it's me maybe it's me and maybe I am micro managing them so much
[00:22:25] that I've beaten the initiative out of them so what I need to do is back off a little bit and
[00:22:31] we'll give them some leeway and give them some ownership of what they're doing and let them
[00:22:35] make some decisions down there and if if you do that then you start seeing it come back and you
[00:22:39] start seeing them take initiative and you feel good and that's a you know one of the chapters in
[00:22:43] the book is actually that right there where I talk about my first deployment to Iraq where I first
[00:22:48] got to Iraq my first time in combat I was just basically wanted to own everything because that was
[00:22:54] my last my personal idea I come to take ownership of this and then I realized my guys
[00:22:58] I'm not gonna all the you know they're not really taking the initiative I wanted to take
[00:23:01] well why is that it's because I'm micro managing them and finally luckily we got over a
[00:23:07] wound with operations we had so many operations to conduct and I was like I can't manage all these
[00:23:12] I can't oversee everything that's happening and I had to cut the guys loose and as soon as I
[00:23:17] caught a loose and said hey you got this and you got that and you got the other thing the guys
[00:23:21] just started stepping up and running everything like I knew like like of course they could because
[00:23:25] they're freaking highly capable guys and they started kicking ass and I realized like oh I don't
[00:23:30] even barely even need to be here right barely even need to be here whereas in the beginning I
[00:23:34] thought oh this is all I'll if I wasn't for me you know and I'm only talking about a period of a
[00:23:39] few weeks of me trying to micro manage everything so I think what's gonna be beneficial about this
[00:23:44] book is that people will see how they can get out of balance and and they'll also see that that
[00:23:50] balance pertains to just about everything and every trait that you have that's positive as a
[00:23:58] leader you can overdue and you can turn it into a negative trait if you go too far
[00:24:05] see you're going to watch out for that you can definitely got to watch out for that it's easy
[00:24:09] for us to see you know we always talk about the attachment attachment so important and for us with you
[00:24:14] know throughout coming to Ashland front it's worth working with these leaders and working with these
[00:24:17] companies you you can see it you know it just it just stands out so obvious that someone is you know
[00:24:23] they're trying to cover move by helping another department and yet they're stepping on people's
[00:24:27] toes and they're pissing people off and you know like why are you you're trying to do my job and make
[00:24:31] me look bad and they get there like well I'm trying to cover move just like you don't me
[00:24:35] I'm just trying to help you and then you're saying well you have to be careful about that you have to
[00:24:40] balance it so once you know it is the absolute most common problem we see all the time and even
[00:24:45] for you know folks that have read extreme ownership you know three or four you know multiple times
[00:24:50] that that are really trying hard to be better leaders they struggle with that and this is
[00:24:55] something to help them and help leaders everywhere and you know and we wrote the book too so that
[00:25:00] it could be read it's a follow on certainly a sequel you gave me a chance to correct that
[00:25:06] yeah why would you say what do you say on the you were talking about jaws to your dog
[00:25:10] yeah podcast one fourteen and I said it's not a sequel it's a standalone book but it absolutely
[00:25:15] is a sequel I'm a follow on book it expands on the concepts however we did write it so that that it
[00:25:20] is a standalone book and you can read you can read you can read if you have if you can read
[00:25:25] dichotomy without having red extreme ownership you'll certainly understand it and be able to
[00:25:29] play yeah but you'd understand the concepts better if you read extreme ownership first no question
[00:25:36] and then you jump into dichotomy which yeah like you said can you read it alone sure you can
[00:25:43] I guess there's echo we need like some kind of a movie reference here like yeah I'm thinking
[00:25:49] term could you see Terminator two yes on its own right but you will you will get more out of it
[00:25:56] if you saw Terminator one first yeah correct same with around see look at me just nailing
[00:26:01] the right year nailing yeah so rambo right first blood part two same deal where you could watch
[00:26:06] just rambo and be pretty pretty happy about it hold on now my problem with that is we know that
[00:26:11] Terminator two is equivalent in quality to Terminator one correct correct correct yeah right
[00:26:19] may I think so okay two is awesome except are we saying that we say that Rambo two which I don't
[00:26:27] even think I've seen first blood part two yeah I don't is are we saying that's the same level of
[00:26:31] quality is Rambo for one you get to be careful there that's what I think we're actually
[00:26:36] I mean I'm not saying that's really jaws two which jaws one which is a masterpiece right
[00:26:43] masterpiece jaws jaws one jaws time called jaws one she's called jaws right jaws two
[00:26:49] problematic we got issues so what I'm saying is we're more like the Terminator scenario
[00:26:56] got you or aliens I was gonna say aliens is an aliens right you can totally watch that movie
[00:27:00] stand alone but obviously gives you some more context if you watch the first one but I think the
[00:27:04] second one's actually better yeah then the first one do you feel like do you feel like dichotomies better
[00:27:09] I actually do I actually do feel I feel it's better I mean I'm interested to hear what readers think
[00:27:16] about it but I I think that it's more useful and applicable to to leaders I mean we have three
[00:27:23] years additional leadership experience and not only evaluating our experiences in combat and in
[00:27:31] the seal teens but but now working with hundreds of leaders and I mean really we're talking
[00:27:37] in you know a couple a hundred plus companies that we've worked with in that time
[00:27:43] easily you know between just you mean you probably not that's not even counting some of the other
[00:27:46] members of our team so we've seen this in in a whole lot of different scenarios and I think
[00:27:52] it really addresses the it's a direct application to the problems that we see so I'm pretty all
[00:27:58] for one I'm looking forward to to readers feedback on was it easier for you to write
[00:28:02] yes yeah I mean for me it definitely was and I say easier just because we we well we became
[00:28:10] better writers as we wrote extreme ownership extreme ownership the first version that we did
[00:28:17] extreme ownership was in the third person and I forget why we even did that but we was about
[00:28:23] these two guys named life in jacco it was about I think I kind of forget I think it was a recommendation
[00:28:29] that came to us from the literature the publisher whatever and we know then we finally had to say
[00:28:34] yeah we're not doing that yeah you know that friend of yours that talks about themselves
[00:28:38] in the third person that you make fun of yeah we're not going to do that yeah so and it's weird
[00:28:44] because there's the book there's there's a couple books I've done in the podcast clay pages
[00:28:49] is the St. Lowe by Glover Johns who's the guy for that you know hack worth wrote about
[00:28:54] he wrote the book clay pages that clay pages as they say Lowe and it's in the third person
[00:28:59] about a guy named major johns and it's him and he writes a thing in the beginning and says hey
[00:29:05] I didn't feel comfortable talking about myself so I did a wrote it this way it's like okay
[00:29:09] and the the only thing I would say that's cool about it you could you could kind of give an outside
[00:29:13] view but the thing that's not cool about it is you couldn't be I was thinking this right now which is
[00:29:18] kind of what I want to hear and that's why I normally cover books that are first person
[00:29:23] people that actually experience it but he's a guy that did a couple other people I've
[00:29:28] when you're when you're Glover Johns though and you're your David Hackworth CDADD you can
[00:29:33] know you can do whatever you want to do it you want for sure now that's another part that's
[00:29:40] again you know we've we've in this book we set it up the same way with combat story principle
[00:29:48] followed by a business example but one thing that I think and this is feedback that that we both
[00:29:55] got that I certainly got was that for what for because the consequences are so high in combat it
[00:30:02] makes the principle very clear and even though people might know well I've never been in combat
[00:30:09] but they understand that if we're not working together as a team doing cover move we will die
[00:30:14] and so when they understand that they go okay now that means if I'm not working with the other
[00:30:20] department then we're gonna lose money or we're not gonna complete our mission or we're not
[00:30:24] gonna take market share yes so I think one of the strongest points of of extreme ownership that we
[00:30:30] did again is the combat stories to to sort of introduce the principles and plus it's cool to hear cool
[00:30:39] stories like that but one of them I think chapter three another another one that we pulled out
[00:30:45] that said it'd be good to sort of cover this one real quick is you opened up chapter three
[00:30:50] with a little a little bit of get some I guess we could say and get that one man I want to I want
[00:30:57] to hear that one I want to hear the Texas Batman get crazy in in Ramadi in 2006 this is bringing
[00:31:03] back some awesome memories here bright orange tracer streaked like laser beams just a few feet
[00:31:10] over our heads each supersonic bullet zipping past with a thunderous crack holy shit I thought
[00:31:16] as we quickly duck down behind the roof wall those are friendly shooting at us I looked over at Dave
[00:31:22] Burke who crouched down nearby like the other seals on the roof with us we tried to stay low enough
[00:31:27] not to get our head shot off Dave looked back at me and shook his head with a smile mixed humor
[00:31:32] and concern that's not cool they've said the understatement of the year Dave Burke was a
[00:31:38] US Marine Corps major a fighter pilot by trade he had been the lead instructor at the legendary
[00:31:43] US Navy fighter weapon school better known as top gun Dave had left the cockpit behind a volunteer
[00:31:49] to serve on the ground as a forward air controller in the most dangerous place in Iraq Ramadi
[00:31:55] he led a supporting arms liaison team or salt attached to the US Marine Corps fifth air
[00:32:00] naval gun fire liaison company Dave and his twelve Marines from salt six a company Charlie
[00:32:06] Batoon to coordinate with the aircraft supporting this operation in the skies overhead they patrolled
[00:32:11] him with us on foot to spearhead the operation ahead of the US Army and Iraqi Army units a US tank
[00:32:18] 200 yards away had fired a burst from its heavy machine gun directly over our position it was
[00:32:24] friendly fire a blue on blue in US military parlance to be killed or horribly wounded by enemy fire
[00:32:31] was one thing to be killed by our own american forces was something much worse that was way too close
[00:32:37] for comfort I thought in the seconds following as a crouches lowest possible behind the low
[00:32:42] concrete wall that was our only means of cover we had to shut that down immediately and alert the tank
[00:32:48] that we were friendly forces to do so I had to contact the specific tank commander directly via radio
[00:32:56] and tell them to cease fire the tanks heavy machine gun was a 50 caliber M2 Browning
[00:33:02] known as the Maadouce it packed a hell of a punch and US military service since 1933 it
[00:33:09] improvement its deadly effectiveness in every american war since World War I each massive
[00:33:14] round could take a man's head clean off or remove the bulk of his chest cavity it could also
[00:33:20] punch right through concrete walls like the one we were hiding behind we had just received a fully
[00:33:25] automatic burst of probably a dozen rounds in a matter of seconds if I didn't shut down the fire
[00:33:30] immediately and let the US tank know we were friendly it could mean horrible wounds in death for a
[00:33:35] number of us blue on blue it's even an extreme ownership we talked there's three episodes of blue on
[00:33:44] blue potential or blue the app with with Chris potentially shooting the american trooper that was in a
[00:33:51] in a building the Bradley getting ready to light up stoneers guys and also the blue on blue
[00:33:59] that the book starts off with there's it's interesting and a reality of war that we talk about
[00:34:06] blue on blue a lot in that urban environment the other thing I noticed is did I don't mean to
[00:34:14] accuse you here like you know on this in this format but each massive round could take a man's head
[00:34:21] clean off is that not just jacked from clean eastwood right there come on man that's 44
[00:34:26] magnum that's dirty hairy right I can either confirm to that you look at you there's uh
[00:34:33] that did you consult with echo for you know party writing here and the echo echo and I we see
[00:34:39] out of the movie quotes there was a little there was a use of parlance in there too that
[00:34:44] uh in the parlance in the parlance on our times you threw a little little big libowski in there
[00:34:50] that we had previously looked out that was a crazy situation and we were I thought we'd done
[00:34:54] everything what was so crazy about that situation for us is I thought we'd done everything in our
[00:34:59] power to mitigate the risk of that and let everybody know where we were a marked our position you know
[00:35:04] talking coordinate with people and and to still get shot at by friendlies you know they uh
[00:35:11] that was that was crazy David I was looking at you like man this this is good this isn't good at all
[00:35:16] so it was it was a I was a foam of that radio trying to get and and talk to them immediately
[00:35:21] and thank God as we talked about on previous podcasts you'd come down on us to be able to use
[00:35:28] to be able to learn how to use those radios ourselves and not just rely on the radio and
[00:35:32] and I was able to swap over and and make direct cops that take and and get them to cease fire
[00:35:38] and that's one of the things that I like completely held the line on and and you know and you
[00:35:42] talk about in the book how there's some other things where I allowed a little bit of slack and you actually
[00:35:47] you actually kind of capture that in a couple pages later that I pulled up here it's a middle of page
[00:35:55] 76 punch through that little section right there and I think it's a it's a good good kind of
[00:36:03] captures what we're talking about in terms of and you were saying this to me early earlier today you're like
[00:36:09] everyone thinks jocca would just be like okay you're gonna shut up do what I tell you to do and it's like
[00:36:13] well actually there's some things I'm gonna tell you that but there's something it's gonna
[00:36:18] there's gonna be a balance well you actually you never said you shut up and do do us do what I tell you to do
[00:36:24] right I'm sure you probably wanted to but many many times yeah and still do I'm I'm sure
[00:36:30] often but there is it's not effective it's never effective to do that and I think so many leaders
[00:36:36] that want to just you know why won't they just do what I tell them to do it's it's people get really
[00:36:40] frustrated by that but obviously there you got to hold a line you absolutely have to hold a line you know
[00:36:44] and if you'd have a linen on us being able to learn how to use a radio I mean that could have
[00:36:48] cost lives right there another verse around comes to the roof wall are we take a main gun
[00:36:53] round now you're talking the the cannon on the tank the 120 millimeter main gun round you know
[00:36:58] just smash through both sides of walls you know it would it would have been absolute catastrophic
[00:37:03] those guys think you know they're under attack they're shooting back at what they think is
[00:37:06] enemy that didn't realize it and it's not like they were they were not ready to use those main
[00:37:11] gun rounds if they had to they were they were putting some buildings down over there for sure
[00:37:16] and that's and that's the hard part right is that you've got to hold a line and there's standards
[00:37:19] that can't be compromised and you've got to you're failing your team and your fan is a leader if you're
[00:37:24] not keeping those standards uh high and making sure the team achieves them and yet also you can't
[00:37:31] be the unrelenting task master the slave driver that just smash his people down is this
[00:37:36] shut up and do it a take yeah this is something that I bring up a lot when I'm working with companies
[00:37:39] is like do you actually want people to do it to do whatever you don't do and the the immediate
[00:37:47] answers like well yeah I just want everyone to shut up and do what I tell them to do well the
[00:37:50] actual answer is no you don't want that if you're a good leader what you want is if I tell
[00:37:56] life hey go take that building over there and you say to me no and I say why not you say well
[00:38:03] there's an idea in the front yard and we'll all get killed if we go there I'm going okay thank you
[00:38:08] now as opposed to you you're you're just going to blindly do whatever I tell you to do well then
[00:38:12] that's going to be problematic so there's a balance in this too and and that's something that we
[00:38:17] talk about all the time but to surround you don't want to surround yourself with the S-men you
[00:38:20] don't want to surround yourself with the S-men and we I've seen plenty of companies where the
[00:38:26] boss man has surrounded himself with the S-men and they yes themselves into the grave because
[00:38:31] there the everyone's just a green oh yep we'll do that that sounds like a great plan boss oh yeah
[00:38:35] yes boss that sounds like a great plan boss and and the next thing you know someone along the
[00:38:40] line should have said hey boss that doesn't make any sense hey boss like oh we got a good
[00:38:45] relationship with these people over here but you know what they're raising their price a little bit
[00:38:49] we don't want to work with them anymore okay well let's think about that you know that that that's
[00:38:55] one of our biggest suppliers do we really want to mix our relationship with our biggest supplier
[00:39:00] does that make sense well you know they're getting in our face now a yes man will be like that's
[00:39:04] right boss we don't take no crap from no one who's through those guys but maybe you want someone
[00:39:08] below you in the chain of commences hey boss let's think about this that's our biggest supplier
[00:39:13] if we cut them off and demand goes up we won't be able to service our customers that could be
[00:39:18] problematic wouldn't you agree how but we negotiate with them so there's my point is you don't just
[00:39:24] want people you don't want to be surrounded by yes man you want people are going to question
[00:39:28] you you want people are going to be that's why like you so much life because you you question
[00:39:32] you you have no problem question you would have said it's all good push you back yeah the
[00:39:37] humble not passive but I I've never never been passive but I think this this here page 76 that's a
[00:39:45] good that's a good little wait a capture what we're talking about as our reflected upon joccos
[00:39:51] demonstration of a leader's responsibility to ensure standards are maintained I thought about
[00:39:56] the times of my career when I failed to do so as a young leader I knew there were times we
[00:40:00] needed to improve our performance do another run to the kill house where we practice close quarters
[00:40:05] combat or add an additional rehearsal to ensure we were fully prepared yet in those moments
[00:40:11] I sometimes hadn't held the line I hadn't pushed the team hard enough any additional work
[00:40:16] assigned to the team was going to get pushback and generate complaints and there were times
[00:40:20] when I let things slide confusing the idea of taking care of your people with allowing them not
[00:40:26] to work as hard but in the end that resulted in mediocre performance and the team never got better
[00:40:32] never held each other accountable this was a failure of leadership my leadership I also
[00:40:38] recognized the dichotomy there were other times when I was overbearing I insisted on doing things
[00:40:43] a certain way because it was my way or harped on trivial matters that were strategically
[00:40:49] unimportant thinking I was doing right by holding the line it caused unnecessary friction
[00:40:55] stifled growth and inhibited junior leaders on the team from stepping up it prevented us from functioning
[00:41:01] properly with effective decentralized command I had seen and worked for numerous leaders throughout my
[00:41:06] navy career who had been overbearing and it wasn't the way I wanted to lead some of them imposed
[00:41:12] harsh discipline screened at their people and crushed them morale of the team no one wanted to follow
[00:41:18] them they might accomplish an immediate task but in the long run the team's growth was smothered
[00:41:24] often their negative example stood starkly in my mind I never want to be a leader like that
[00:41:31] there you go the tyrannical leader that's run around screaming at everyone and and like you just
[00:41:38] said they'll get some little tasks accomplished and they actually think that what's horrible is
[00:41:43] they get some little task accomplished because they screamed in yelled and it reinforces that behavior
[00:41:48] and so they become even more tyrannical and yell and scream even more and they never see the fact
[00:41:53] that acting that way it'll get you a little short term thing done but you'll never get everything
[00:41:58] you can out of people you never get everything you can out of somebody that you've beaten in
[00:42:02] this mission you're they're not going to perform to their fullest potential and capability and
[00:42:07] that's just where you're going to be that's just where you're going to be the other thing
[00:42:13] it takes this is this is one of those things like if you've got something that's hard to do right
[00:42:20] you've got something that the team has gone to do that's hard to do and you're wishy-washy about it
[00:42:26] you know it's the right thing to do but you're wishy-washy about how you approach the team with doing it
[00:42:32] it's not going to happen it's just not going to happen I'm reading another book right now
[00:42:36] by a guy that was in Vietnam with Hacworth and he's saying just he would just lay down the
[00:42:42] law like Hacworth is like no we're doing this this is what we're going to do this is how it's going to be
[00:42:45] and that's that's what it is you know I've got so many examples from my career but I'll tell you
[00:42:53] really kind of a lame one but it's it's worth telling so back good noon dude guess what we used to
[00:43:00] do in the teams we used to drink beer a lot of it and that was kind of like hey you know we're
[00:43:04] we're in the steels you know we're beer drink and frog men and that's cool and I was in a
[00:43:11] seal platoon where we drink a lot even more than a normal seal platoon which is what you
[00:43:18] know what you put you in the running for a lot and this is back in the 90s there's no
[00:43:23] we're going on and I've said this before kind of the way that we proved ourselves because there's
[00:43:28] a certain level of sacrifice you have to make to prove to your teammates that you're like you're
[00:43:32] willing to sacrifice well one of the ways that you can sacrifice is you can just drink a lot
[00:43:36] and prove that you can go all night go hard and still get up the next day and so I was in a
[00:43:41] seal platoon where we drank a lot just about everyone in the chain of command except for the the
[00:43:47] commander the OIC but everyone else you know we drank hard and you know we we've partied in whatever
[00:43:54] and we were a ship board we were an argue platoon so we were deploying on board a ship
[00:44:00] and when we were getting ready to deploy on the ship it was kind of like oh well you know we'll
[00:44:08] just because you're not allowed to drink any alcohol on the ship you're not allowed to have
[00:44:11] any alcohol you're not allowed drinking alcohol you after 90 days it's see you can get a beer day
[00:44:16] they give 45 or 45 or back when I was in the sea get you get one beer 45 days so they gave us
[00:44:24] it two beers but I will say they gave us fosters so they were big oil cans right but you're
[00:44:30] living large yeah I did two two beer days in one deployment anyways you're not allowed other
[00:44:36] than that you're not allowed to drink that's the rules and so I think it wasn't like we openly
[00:44:42] discussed like how we gonna smuggle beer or maybe we did a little bit but our bosses came down
[00:44:46] to like yeah well there's no drinking on no drinking on the ship and we were like okay those
[00:44:51] little they just came down and put the rules down like hey no drinking on the ship and I had
[00:44:56] respect for my off my platoon commander at the time had respect for my platoon chief at the time
[00:45:03] and they came down and said yeah well there's no drinking on ship so don't even think about it
[00:45:08] we're like okay cool that's the lock came down and we just got on board we just got on board with it
[00:45:12] whereas if it would have been well you know a little bit of wishy washing us us young E3's E4's
[00:45:19] and E5's if they would have been remotely wishy washing we didn't like oh cool you guys go drink
[00:45:24] whatever you want just don't let us see it or whatever and that would have been bad because eventually
[00:45:28] guess what you put a bunch of seals on a ship with with booze and you leave them on there for
[00:45:33] multiple days it's see months it's see well they're gonna have an incident of some kind they're
[00:45:37] gonna get a fight they're gonna throw up somewhere they're gonna you know some just dumb stuff
[00:45:41] it's gonna get to the highest level of attention it's gonna be a total disaster so the idea of
[00:45:47] actually just stepping up and holding the line and I'll tell you what I learned as a leader
[00:45:52] is it's liberating to do that it's liberating to say hey look here's the rules and and you know
[00:45:58] I did this with the fact of when we got back to our body we got to our body and they told us
[00:46:02] we had to work with Iraqi soldiers and everyone was kind of him and it honed about having to work with Iraqi
[00:46:06] soldiers and I told you guys don't even submit a concept of operations without Iraqi soldiers don't even
[00:46:12] submit it because we're not doing it and you guys were like okay got it yeah it is super liberating
[00:46:19] I think that's the you know one of the things that that I you know that I learned from you as we
[00:46:24] started working together I mean and I talked to be about this all the time I talked about on the podcast
[00:46:29] before but it was the kind of things that you know you probably should be doing but for whatever
[00:46:34] reason you are and and you know for you could just put it perspective for me like it's very black and
[00:46:38] why not like no if you're not if you're not holding the line on these things that are important
[00:46:42] and pushing your team to perform with the highest standard or make it sure they're not going to do
[00:46:46] something it's going to get them in trouble or cause massive issues not only for us but for the entire
[00:46:50] you know not on for our unit but the entire seal teams then then that's you're failing them as a
[00:46:55] leader you you've got to hold the line on that stuff you've got to and and it is very liberating
[00:47:00] to say oh check okay that's the way it is and I think that ambiguity is very frustrating for people
[00:47:05] but they don't know what's right you don't know what's wrong they can get away with stuff
[00:47:08] yeah that's what I was going to say but the people below you and the chain of command they
[00:47:12] get frustrated because they're like what was that mean and they're going to push it to the envelope
[00:47:16] but they just got got away with it over here but that guy didn't you know I mean that's yeah those are
[00:47:20] the kind of things where there needs to there's got to be a standard you got to hold that standard and
[00:47:24] it's I it the team is so much better off when you do that and certainly bruiser absolutely was
[00:47:30] and and this is one of those things where then people think well juggle always holds the line and
[00:47:37] there would be no slack whatsoever right no fucking slack right that's how we roll and it's like
[00:47:42] hmm actually there is slack and there's times where you give slack I mean I mean I always talk about
[00:47:47] and we always talk about how I was super strict about uniforms right like hey we're going to
[00:47:52] wear uniforms no patches all this stuff right we talk about that stuff all the time but when someone
[00:47:55] wasn't when we when we were when we were in our camp I didn't care what you wore if you were
[00:48:01] going to be interacting with the army of the Marine Corps I didn't care what you wore at all I mean
[00:48:06] I barely put on a shirt when we were on bed right I mean I'd be sitting in the tactical operations
[00:48:10] that are let me flip flops yeah flip flops and that's it yeah it brown t-shirt and sometimes yeah
[00:48:16] sometimes and and so I didn't I'm not holding line I'm not getting crazy because guess what that's
[00:48:22] not important if I would have been running around policing up people's uniforms inside of our camp
[00:48:28] which was just us man I would have wasted a bunch of leadership capital and frustrated everyone
[00:48:36] and then guess what when I tell them hey you got to learn how to program your radio that is that is
[00:48:44] explained with the same importance as hey you got to blouse your boots when you're inside our camp
[00:48:49] that's the wrong message to send so that's why this that's why I wrote this book because this is
[00:48:54] about balance you've got to be able to balance when to hold the line what's important what's
[00:48:58] worth holding line for and what things do you go okay you know what you know what lathe you
[00:49:03] guys want to do it that way that's cool go do it and that's what you need to learn that balance
[00:49:08] that balance is hard it's hard to do I think that again I think the awareness of it I think the
[00:49:17] awareness of it and I don't really know when I recognize the awareness of it I mean I know
[00:49:24] like when when Flynn Flynn puts up the slides of like the juggle breathe from back in the day
[00:49:30] I talked about the dichotomy leadership back then I'm surprised I even knew what dichotomy meant
[00:49:37] I literally forgot what I'm looking for the brief I looked at I remember what I'm talking about
[00:49:41] but it's one of those things I recognized it I saw it and I could definitely see it but
[00:49:48] now and just the more we work with companies even when I was in the teams the more I was working with
[00:49:52] the see-up tune you'd see when a guy was like here's a good example you know when a guy talks too much
[00:49:58] when you have a leader that just talks all the time just doesn't stop he always has something
[00:50:02] else he he won't let anyone else get the last word it's always that guy's people stop listening to
[00:50:07] him because he's talking all the time and it's like hey I got a good idea well why don't you be
[00:50:12] quiet for a little while and I hated to have to tell that to somebody because they get super self-conscious
[00:50:18] but you know I'm usually phrased it a different way like hey you should you should let your
[00:50:22] guys run a little bit you know let them let them get the last word and let it's going to give
[00:50:26] them more ownership of what you're doing if when they get done saying and that's how we're going
[00:50:30] to do it tonight and then this guy chimes in and you know what when we do it that way and you're
[00:50:35] like oh you don't need to say it again you think you don't need to double tap guys would say this
[00:50:41] debriefing I'm going to double tap that but that's already been tapped don't double tap it
[00:50:46] we're going to triple tap this thing we used to have a symbol if you can't see this here listen
[00:50:50] we put our two whatever two pea signs and touch your thumbs together and it's like four legs
[00:50:56] sticking up in the air that's a dead horse that's the symbol for dead horse bro you don't need to
[00:51:00] say this again it's dead horse quit beating it to death wait what is double what is tap double tap
[00:51:06] double tap well when you shoot a target you shoot it once and then what you normally do is you shoot
[00:51:10] a twice boom boom and so it's called a double tap so go back a fast mobile so if I was
[00:51:15] doing briefing you and and I was like echo you know you need to keep your shop groups a little bit
[00:51:22] tighter on the next run cool you got it and I said well the double tap on that you know you really
[00:51:28] need to work on the shop yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[00:51:31] I'm saying the same thing kind of like I second that notion it kind of thing it is but if you said that
[00:51:36] if you said I second that you could leave it there right but if you said I second that because you
[00:51:43] really need to tighten up your groups because your groups are a little bit dispersed around the
[00:51:47] target area and that's going to be bad we all know it's bad bro we all know it's bad bro
[00:51:50] you know we all know it's thing thing office space TPS report yeah I understand clear now and
[00:51:58] now all that being said so it's cool I think again having the combat stories let some of these things
[00:52:05] sign and that's a good example right there you're talking first person what you're actually thinking
[00:52:10] which I think is powerful but it's good also to to outline the principles and that's what we did
[00:52:19] so here's one of the principles we outlined and this is an important one because
[00:52:25] man we got because we talk about being aggressive as a matter of fact we have T shirts it's a
[00:52:29] default aggressive right like we're not playing around being aggressive and what does that mean
[00:52:33] that means that we get some people in the in the military and in the civilian sector that we say
[00:52:40] D default mode aggressive they go default mode aggressive and they don't know when to stop they get
[00:52:44] reckless they get careless they go too hard and so going back to the book here
[00:52:51] problems aren't going to solve themselves a leader must get aggressive and take action to solve
[00:52:58] the problems and implement a solution being too passive and waiting for a solution to appear
[00:53:04] often enables the problem to escalate and get out of control the enemy isn't going to back off
[00:53:09] the leader must get aggressive and put the enemy in check the good deal isn't going to deliver
[00:53:18] itself to a company the leader has to go out and make a good deal happen changes and new
[00:53:25] methodologies in a team are going to implement themselves leaders need to aggressively implement them
[00:53:32] and aggressive mindset should be the default setting of any leader default aggressive
[00:53:37] this means that the best leaders the best teams don't wait to act instead understanding the
[00:53:45] strategic vision or commanders intent they aggressively execute to overcome obstacles
[00:53:50] capitalize on immediate opportunities accomplish the mission and win rather than
[00:53:57] passively waiting to be told what to do default aggressive leaders proactively seek out ways
[00:54:03] to further the strategic mission they understand the commanders intent and where they have authority
[00:54:08] to do so they execute for decisions that are beyond their pay grade or above their authority
[00:54:14] default aggressive leaders still make a recommendation of the chain of command to solve
[00:54:19] problems and execute key tasks to achieve strategic victory in seal platoons and task units
[00:54:26] we expect this from leaders at every level right down to the front line trooper in charge of just
[00:54:32] himself and his small piece of the mission but this mentality is crucial to any leader in any
[00:54:39] team or organization it is just as critical to success in business as on the battlefield
[00:54:48] aggressive means proactive but it doesn't mean that leaders can get angry lose their temper or be
[00:54:57] aggressive toward their people a leader must always deal professionally with subordinates on the team
[00:55:04] peers leaders up the chain of command customers or clients and personnel and supporting roles
[00:55:09] outside the immediate team speaking angrily to others is ineffective losing your temper is a sign
[00:55:17] of weakness the aggression that wins on the battlefield in business or in life is directed not
[00:55:24] toward people but toward solving problems achieving goals and accomplishing the mission it is also
[00:55:32] critical to balance aggression with careful thought and analysis to make sure that risks have been
[00:55:39] assessed and mitigated the dichotomy with the default aggressive mindset is that sometimes
[00:55:47] hesitation allows a leader to further understand a situation so that he or she can react properly to it
[00:55:56] rather than immediately respond to enemy fire sometimes the prudent decision is to wait and see how
[00:56:02] it develops is it a simple reconnaissance by fire is it a faint by the enemy meant to distract from the
[00:56:10] real attack is the enemy simply trying to lure you into a confined area where they have a
[00:56:15] superior force waiting to ambush a careful moment of consideration might reveal the enemies true
[00:56:23] intentions to be overly aggressive without critical thinking is to be reckless that can lead the
[00:56:30] team into a disaster and put the greater mission in peril to disregard prudent counsel when someone
[00:56:37] with experience urges caution to dismiss significant threats or to fail to plan for likely contingencies
[00:56:44] is foolhardy it is bad leadership a chief contributing factor to recklessness comes from what military
[00:56:53] historians have long referred to as the disease of victory this disease takes place when a few
[00:57:00] battlefield successes producing overconfidence in a team's own tactical prowess while underestimating
[00:57:07] the capabilities of its enemy or competitor this is a problem not just for combat leaders but for
[00:57:14] leaders and teams anywhere in any arena throughout the business world and the civilian sector it is
[00:57:21] a leaders duty to fight against this disease so that the team despite its success never gets complacent
[00:57:30] the risking any action must be carefully weighed against the potential rewards of mission success
[00:57:37] and of course to counter that thought the cost of inaction must be weighed as well as aggressive
[00:57:46] as leaders must be leaders must be cautious that they are not running to their deaths simply because
[00:57:53] it is their instinct to take action that I caught a me between aggression and caution must be balanced
[00:58:01] so be aggressive but never reckless so there's a principle principle laid out and then of
[00:58:12] course it's followed up with a business example of which there are manifold of businesses where
[00:58:19] the business gets too aggressive they start getting properties to put more stores into and they build
[00:58:25] up all this rent that they got to pay every month the next thing you know they have a down
[00:58:29] month and they got real estate bills to pay or they start hiring a ton of people because they
[00:58:33] get a super aggressive and that's you know kind of where this story leads to is we're bringing
[00:58:37] going to bring in all these people because we think this future success is coming and the next thing
[00:58:40] you know your overhead is so huge because you got overly aggressive you end up with problems
[00:58:47] that is hard too that's so hard because that is absolutely in my nature is to
[00:58:53] and I think and to and so many people that resonate with extreme ownership that come to the
[00:58:57] monsters that I mean we've got default aggressive leaders that want to go dominate the universe
[00:59:01] and you've got to really you've got to really take a step back in the touch and think okay
[00:59:05] what am I not thinking about what I'm not seeing how my planning for those contingencies we
[00:59:10] just talked about you know a situation today you know with a client where you know they
[00:59:15] when things are going really well that's when you've got to be looking at what what what's
[00:59:20] what's about to go wrong and I haven't seen yet you know what I'm not planning for so
[00:59:24] it is very very difficult to balance this is a leader but you absolutely have to balance that you
[00:59:29] have to be aggressive you have to maneuver you know so many people get you know the the
[00:59:33] paralysis to analysis you know people talk about don't want to make it make a decision until
[00:59:38] you know the solution is right there and it's 100% guarantee nothing is ever 100% guarantee
[00:59:44] and by that time that's you know that's even close to being that you know the your
[00:59:47] competition's already maneuvered on the battlefield you're going to get wiped out and killed
[00:59:51] you know in the business world you know you're going to get you're going to get crushed by
[00:59:55] your competition and so you and yet being aggressive and also being prudent so that you're not
[01:00:00] falling in the traps not running to your death not sending your team up for total disaster
[01:00:05] and it's it's the only the only answer to this the only answer to this is you have to be balanced
[01:00:11] that's the only answer because if you go too far in one direction you know if you get super aggressive
[01:00:17] and you take too much risk and you'll get wiped out if you don't do anything and you sit there
[01:00:22] you're going to get wiped out you have to you have to balance these two all the time and
[01:00:29] yeah you're right this is something that it's something that we see all the time and I saw
[01:00:35] you know training seal platoons you get the guy that's super hyper aggressive and every time
[01:00:40] there's something going on there hey let's send a fire team over there and okay you send
[01:00:45] a fire team over there and then that fire team gets whacked and then another fire team over there okay
[01:00:48] then that fire team gets whacked and then another fire team next thing you know you're ever
[01:00:51] a patoon left okay so that was good you got everyone killed because you were hyper aggressive
[01:00:56] the other end of the spectrum is what we're not sure where the fire's coming from so we're going to
[01:01:00] sit here and wait okay well while you're not shooting at the enemy the enemy is maneuvering
[01:01:05] and they are getting high ground and they are getting a superior position and this is the exact
[01:01:09] same thing in the business world where I mean the the example of like hey we got to grow and so
[01:01:15] the aggressive leader the overly aggressive the hyper aggressive leader will grow too fast
[01:01:20] and all of a sudden has overhead that's too much and can't afford to go on but at the same time
[01:01:27] you get a you get a company that's not that's not aggressive enough and they should be entering
[01:01:32] another another line of operation they should be putting they should be entering another market
[01:01:39] you know we were talking about this morning while we were working out block blockbuster
[01:01:44] and blackberry right blockbuster and blackberry who would have thought that blockbuster which was
[01:01:49] there was a blockbuster on every street corner there was a block blackberry and everyone's pocket
[01:01:54] and they owned something like 80 something percent of the market share that they're done
[01:01:59] now are you telling me that someone that was default aggressive would have said you know what
[01:02:04] we need to figure out how to you know what these these these movies might be able to come on the
[01:02:09] internet in fact there's streaming video let's get into that market and of course they would
[01:02:13] have the capital they would have the infrastructure they would have the people and they could
[01:02:18] they would have been able to make that happen they had relationships with with the with the
[01:02:23] with the big Hollywood studios right they were getting sent those movies they had
[01:02:27] relationships they could have done that but they were sitting there going we were you're going to
[01:02:31] come rent these videos for 499 you got to get that VHS tape up in here right if that's the way it's
[01:02:38] got to be and same thing with blackberry they're thinking on loans gonna leave us because we got the
[01:02:42] little thing with the keyboard on it and we're set and meanwhile they're they're both done
[01:02:48] done lack of aggressive lack of foresight lack of planning and and for me it's really just lack
[01:02:54] of being aggressive aggressively looking around now we could go the other way and we could look at
[01:02:59] look at companies that put so much capital out there that they run out of money and they go
[01:03:05] they go down to so what do you have to do you have to balance you have to balance such which
[01:03:12] you have to do you know one more thing I think we do one more thing from this from this book
[01:03:19] just you and this is short little piece we were talking about earlier and it kind of relates
[01:03:24] to what and I think the reason we were talking about because it was kind of related in the disease
[01:03:28] of victory you had that little chunk again we do the we do the applications of business so people can see
[01:03:36] really directly how these principles in combat and the principal correlates to the civilian
[01:03:41] sector but you had a good one just a couple paragraphs on 84 about your kind of a stereotypical fire
[01:03:51] up extreme ownership boss that's going to come in there and make stuff happen I thought this was a good one go
[01:04:01] I've read a lot about patent the executive vice president said with pride referring to general
[01:04:05] George S. Paton Jr the famous U.S. Army general who's exploits in World War II were legendary
[01:04:11] I love that you reference patent in your presentation I want exactly the kind of discipline
[01:04:15] organization around here that patent expected we need people who carry out orders not
[01:04:20] question them I could tell right away that the executive vice president had no previous military
[01:04:26] experience he clearly misunderstood how effective leaders in the military led their teams it was not
[01:04:31] through rigid authoritarianism do this because I said so or you'll be punished sure there were
[01:04:37] those the military who tried to lead like that but it was never effective so there you go and I know
[01:04:45] you and I both and the rest of the team has dealt with guys that they they have that vision of
[01:04:50] this military leadership and usually it's guys that weren't the military and you know I like to
[01:04:54] draw a line and maybe I'm right maybe I'm wrong about this I think well and and from what I know
[01:05:00] from military history when you go back to conscripts when you when you get to the conscripts those
[01:05:09] guys are beaten until they are doing what they you know what they're told to do and we've we've
[01:05:14] covered some great examples of that on this podcast of situations where it's like oh you know
[01:05:18] what you know how we're going to lead we're going to lead through tyranny and we're going to lead through
[01:05:22] punishment and we're going to lead through rigid discipline rigid discipline which obviously everyone
[01:05:28] knows I'm a fan of discipline but when you're leading guys and the reason that they're following
[01:05:33] your orders is because they fear being beaten or fear being shot that but shot by you you know
[01:05:40] punished by you if that's why they're again it's the same situation where if that's why they're doing it
[01:05:47] you're never going to get the true optimal work and effort out of those people ever and even
[01:05:54] from from history I mean if you read Alexander the Great right or Julia Caesar who's a great
[01:05:59] example and they had conscripts but his men loved him and admired him and held him in tremendous
[01:06:04] regards because he he rewarded them he gave them credit he he explained well high I mean he was he was a guy
[01:06:10] who was always put himself at the forefront of of where the fighting was and you know much more
[01:06:17] so than just a political leader like many of the Roman the Roman leaders so just a phenomenal leader
[01:06:22] on the battlefield and so even even then you're the most effective leaders are always going to be
[01:06:27] they're always going to try to get the team on board with a mission help them understand why they're
[01:06:32] doing it put it put a greater purpose in their mind and I think so often as you said before
[01:06:37] you know leader leader like that this was this was a aggressive leader great you know great
[01:06:41] person who wanted to dominate the universe and and make things happen love extreme ownership
[01:06:45] and yet is is struggling to see that because they think they're leading like you would lead
[01:06:49] they look at they look at a picture jockel like this is what jockel would do it's just crush everyone
[01:06:54] and tell them to do it because I said and and as you've explained it doesn't work it doesn't work that
[01:06:58] way it's never effective and that's why that's why I'm proud of this book and I think it'd be so
[01:07:03] useful to leaders to see you can't do that if you do that you're not ever going to be a success
[01:07:08] was you could be if you actually get the team on board explain why to them and and tie that to the
[01:07:14] bigger purpose of of what you're trying to accomplish in the world yeah yeah I think that's
[01:07:19] all true I think the book will be helpful to people so yeah that caught a new leadership it's coming
[01:07:25] out September 25th if you want to if you want to get some you can get some of that we got some
[01:07:30] Q&A we got some questions to discuss here how does jump right into it number one what are
[01:07:39] speaking of that this is this is falling together quite nicely question number one what are things
[01:07:45] to look for when you're debating whether to raise your voice or yell due to those under you being lazy
[01:07:53] or unmotivated y'all talk a lot about the importance of self control and not just losing it
[01:07:59] but would you say there's a time and place for raising the intensity while still being respectful
[01:08:04] towards your guys so there you go yellin and scream it gets them sometimes you gotta just drop the hammer
[01:08:12] jocco yelled and scream it us all the time like I've I've talked about on this you know I think on the
[01:08:17] podcast we started talking about all the time and the number of times at jocco screamed and yelled at me
[01:08:24] zero zero times in all the years that we worked together and and I know I gave him
[01:08:29] at least dozens maybe hundreds of opportunities that we want to probably done that and he didn't
[01:08:34] do that because he realized it it wasn't effective so now listen there there is there is a time where
[01:08:40] you know if there's a major safety issue going on you're trying to get people's attention and you
[01:08:45] want people to cease fire or you need to rally the truth where you got to raise your voice and
[01:08:49] get people's attention and I think that's you can't be afraid to do that as a little bit. There's
[01:08:53] certainly times where I say hey life get get those bodies lined up over there or stuff like that I mean
[01:08:57] for sure that's is that yelling well yeah I'm definitely raising my voice and using a loud voice but
[01:09:02] I'm not doing it whatever with anger it's just hey you got to hear me and so and also you know
[01:09:10] there is time where you've got to you've got to pick up the intensity in your voice so that people
[01:09:14] realize there's something important happening right there's just enough now you don't want to
[01:09:19] yell and scream and get all crazy but to be like hey I need vehicles here now like that is different
[01:09:25] then hey can you get the vehicles over here now right those are two different things and you
[01:09:30] I would react differently if I heard those two voices so yes now to go back and this vehicle
[01:09:35] over you now no one now we're creating a whole panic situation but that that's a great point too
[01:09:39] right and it's it's the kind of you know never cry wolf you know sorry so when when you're if you're
[01:09:45] yelling all the time how do you do vehicles over here right now when there's nothing at stake and it's
[01:09:50] no big deal and it's just a routine movement you know then when you do that and you really need it
[01:09:56] then no one's paying attention they think oh it's just life yelling again into the radio so
[01:10:00] so I think that's another reason why I actually have seen Jaco raised his voice on one occasion
[01:10:07] yeah and when there was a series issue that needed to be addressed and you needed to get the
[01:10:13] person's attention to show just how serious of a situation it was and it got everybody's attention
[01:10:18] yeah it got everybody's attention right away because you never did that and when you did do it
[01:10:22] it was like oh man yeah and I was always tell that to leaders like being on the radio and this
[01:10:28] good goes for being in a meeting right if you go to a meeting if you're in charge of a meeting
[01:10:31] and you talk the whole time and then you have something important to say at the end well that's great
[01:10:36] but it's not as impactful as when you say very few things during the meeting and then at the end you
[01:10:41] say hey guys listen up here's what's going on with us and everyone pays attention so I've said this
[01:10:47] before the last you talk the more people listen and that goes true here the more you yell the last
[01:10:52] people listen and it takes away the opportunity if you ever do have to yell it's going to have
[01:10:58] zero impact so my blanket statement is you should hardly ever have to raise your voice and
[01:11:04] it should just barely ever happen next question it's a long one can you explain
[01:11:15] more how you managed working with the local Iraqi troops general matters who I hold in the
[01:11:21] highest extreme a steam said something to the effect that if you are doing anything that negatively
[01:11:27] impacts relations with allied forces you are of more used to the enemy than you are to the
[01:11:32] your team this makes it quite obvious that he believes that full cooperation with allied forces
[01:11:38] is key to attaining victory it is a well established fact that most of the Iraqi forces were
[01:11:44] incompetent to the point of posing danger to US troops so what steps did you take to ensure success
[01:11:51] when working with them well obviously relations with your allies are critical it's cover move
[01:12:00] ready you got to work together as a team and if you're working against each other that's absolutely
[01:12:05] catastrophic I think for us with Iraqi troops you know again we talked about how that was
[01:12:13] liberating right for for you know the big pushback was always like we want to do just seal
[01:12:17] you don't matter what race we call just seals or just Americans you know just like NATO ally
[01:12:23] forces and not work with with Iraqi troops and you know when you said that right away attack
[01:12:30] that's good listen don't even put up a concept of operations we have a connoisse we call it
[01:12:35] which is the approval for the plan that doesn't have Iraqi troops on it okay got it we're going
[01:12:40] to figure out a way to make that happen so that was the lime was drawn we knew we had to do that
[01:12:44] and we knew it was also important I mean because you explained that we talked about it we we thought
[01:12:48] through that but obviously we had to take some steps to mitigate that so I think there were
[01:12:55] again this is a dichotomy it's you got to be balanced there were I saw units who thought
[01:13:00] and we gave some examples even extreme ownership certainly and we talk about regular
[01:13:05] about where you you see a unit that would take two or four Americans in a bunch of Iraqis and
[01:13:09] try to go into really bad area like man you look you're not going to be able to count on those
[01:13:13] Iraqis in the middle of a gunfight when they're overwhelmed you better have enough Americans
[01:13:17] here to have you back so so they were asking too much of of the Iraqis and then their other
[01:13:22] units that didn't want to do you know didn't want to have any Iraqis with them didn't want
[01:13:25] any relationship with them and I had some stern talking to you know talking to some of my guys
[01:13:30] who wouldn't what weren't treating our Iraqi soldiers with respect I threatened one of my
[01:13:35] guys who was going to have to go sleep in the Iraqis so just barracks if you didn't go shake their hand
[01:13:39] I think you know in that time individual who's a great guy I think that was the last threat
[01:13:44] you had to make him submit to you I think I was serious the president I'm totally serious
[01:13:50] I'm serious so and we all what props to props to SF guys, mid teams that go out there and they do they
[01:13:56] live they eat you know even even having to code a mile in here he did two meals a day out of three
[01:14:02] with with his afghan soldiers that's that's awesome and you know what I liked about this
[01:14:08] question was the way that that it relates to to the civilian sector because you know what I talk
[01:14:16] about a lot a lot of times I talk about how my relationship with my boss regardless of who my boss
[01:14:21] was regardless of my boss was great or my boss was horrible my relationship was always the same
[01:14:25] I was going to have this great I was going to build relationship where they trusted me they gave me
[01:14:29] what I needed to do my job and then they let me do my job that's the relationship I always had with all my
[01:14:33] bosses right but I I that same methodology and concept can absolutely be applied to other
[01:14:41] organizations that you're supposed to work with so whether it's the army whether it's the
[01:14:46] Marine Corps whether it's the Iraqi soldiers whether it's the MPs whether it's the I the the intel
[01:14:53] people that the intel organization that you're working with no matter what the organization you can
[01:14:58] build a relationship again might you love that organization no you might not and where I see this all
[01:15:04] the time it well we see it all the time now is with businesses because guess what there's no
[01:15:07] business that's stand on the worship center is very few that are completely vertically integrated
[01:15:12] businesses I mean like an origin right we don't we we're pretty vertically integrated but guess
[01:15:17] what we don't grow the cotton like we don't do that we don't grow cotton but guess what we have a
[01:15:21] good relationship with the people that grow cotton we have a good relationship with the people at
[01:15:26] stain the cotton or sorry die the cotton so we build those relationships with those other people now
[01:15:33] I work with businesses where there's a supplier that they don't like so guess what they
[01:15:38] form a hostile relationship with this whole company a whole company what could does that do them
[01:15:43] it doesn't do them any good at all what it means is they have no personal relationships they
[01:15:48] they form that antagonistic relationship with a whole other organization and it's almost impossible to
[01:15:53] overcome so now this is something where if you don't explain that culture throughout your team they're
[01:15:59] going to treat that other team horribly and so if you're waiting on supplies if you're on a construction
[01:16:03] site and you're waiting for materials to be delivered and you don't have a good relationship with
[01:16:08] the people that deliver the drywall and now the drywall's run late for whatever reason and you call
[01:16:14] you you fly off the handle or whatever you're you're not going to get that drywall any earlier
[01:16:20] it's not happening heavy ever you know when I call customer service right customer service I
[01:16:26] learned this when I was working for the animal working for the animals aid I'd call up we didn't
[01:16:30] we travel a lot and I'd have to call up whatever delta or American whoever and I'd be trying to get
[01:16:38] whatever seats on an aircraft or something or a flight that was full or whatever get him an upgrade
[01:16:44] whatever and you know that's a hey how you doing that's always a I always start off with the
[01:16:50] with the because they're gone American airline how can I help you and they're mad right they're just
[01:16:54] mad to start with like how to get their mad whatever you know airline whatever car rental service
[01:17:02] whatever restaurant like people are just mad they're care they're mad they don't know who you are
[01:17:07] well they actually they've just talked to probably you know the last 25 people of screen
[01:17:11] screen in the island that's awful so you know you you call them and say hey how's it going and
[01:17:16] you know I always I had little head little micro jokes that I would make with the airlines
[01:17:21] that I used them with all of them all the time but one of them was I'd say they'd say well
[01:17:26] do you need to sit next to your boss and I'd say you know what I'd honestly appreciate it
[01:17:30] if you put me as far away from it and they'd laugh and then they'd try and hook me up even
[01:17:34] though my boss was a great guy and I'd sit with them all day but just it was a funny thing and it
[01:17:38] humanized me with them they thought I was that some poor sorry bastard that had to travel
[01:17:43] with his boss and then they were trying to take care of me it was like awesome so I would get the
[01:17:47] hookups I remember one time I went up and I had a conversation on the phone with someone and then
[01:17:54] of course this is different because it was live but I had a conversation like no can't get
[01:17:56] you on that flight and then I went up to the counter and I was like hey how you doing I'm trying
[01:18:00] to get me in my boss and it's on this flight and we're trying to get there and and he's acting
[01:18:03] like this gross like well what do you know do you need to go to him like well look if we don't get there
[01:18:08] here's the deal if you can just get my boss on that's great if if neither one of us get
[01:18:13] get on this flight it's been nice knowing you because I'm screwed and she just started laughing
[01:18:20] and again humanized it and then it's like all of a sudden she's like oh guess what we're going
[01:18:24] to we're going to bump some of these or whatever and she's making room and we're on the flight
[01:18:28] so don't develop this antagonistic relationship with another organization
[01:18:33] with Iraqi soldiers like is it great working with Iraqi soldiers? No it sucks it's hard
[01:18:38] but guess what that's what we have to do and I'll tell you something else strategically
[01:18:45] the Iraqi soldiers that are descendants of the guys that we train I mean maybe not I'm saying training
[01:18:51] or or training descendants right the guys that we trained trained to guys who just went and
[01:18:57] fought back and got Ramadi back from ISIS and got Mazul back from ISIS those are the guys
[01:19:03] that went in there and did the bulk of the fight did they get supported by Americans yes did
[01:19:05] Americans do a kick-ass job of doing massive fire support yes but the guys that were moving from street
[01:19:11] to street those were majority Iraqi soldiers did they have special ops guys with them yes but
[01:19:16] it was a majority of the people that were moving through the streets where Iraqi soldiers
[01:19:20] and there's no way possible that wouldn't have happened if American coalition forces
[01:19:26] over the last whatever it was 10 years 12 years would have taken those guys and made them work
[01:19:32] and done the the type of partner missions that we did with them so it was and when I said again
[01:19:38] when I say we are not talking about us the the seal teams I'm talking about everyone everyone made
[01:19:44] this concerted effort and it ended up being a great call because when those guys went out to
[01:19:50] to finally have to fight to take these cities back they were able to do it
[01:19:54] not totally by themselves but they were able to do it they did it and that's a vast improvement
[01:19:59] if we were to send if we would have sent the Iraqi troops as they were when we were in
[01:20:04] Ramadi into Mazul they would have gotten decimated so it's a credit to the US military it's a
[01:20:10] credit to the Iraqi military that they have now gotten up to speed where they can push forward
[01:20:14] and it's a credit to the US military and other coalition forces that worked with them to get them
[01:20:19] up to speed and what that all boils back to is forming relationships with the people that you
[01:20:26] are dependent on not just the people but the organizations that's all it's in.
[01:20:32] Yeah I think they we learn less and it's let's do let's use them for their tricks and that's
[01:20:38] what we learn in Ramadi we put them in situations where they could succeed we took enough
[01:20:43] Americans where we could actually succeed and help them succeed and of course we put some
[01:20:50] some efforts to mitigate rest too with with all we always said armed guys the oil head guys
[01:20:54] looking around we always with presented a hard target if one of those guys decided that they wanted
[01:20:58] to start batting for the other team and we were in a position to handle those problems and we never had
[01:21:04] any issues as a result but that's what you have to do is it's all about building coalitions and
[01:21:09] using people's strengths and complimenting those strengths and working with the team it's
[01:21:14] cover move if you don't do that you're going to you're going to fail and to all you people at the
[01:21:18] airlines thank you thank you for taking care of me over the years appreciate it next question
[01:21:25] jocco lathe and echo your opinion has been solicited on this leadership question right here
[01:21:34] so we'll see how that works out a good leader ensures his team understands what their goals are
[01:21:40] and why they are performing tasks but how do you balance doing this with not being the leader that
[01:21:46] talks so much that the team stops listening we do we just cover this for a long period of time pretty
[01:21:51] much it didn't we I guess we can leave it at this echo do you agree with what we said earlier
[01:21:57] or do you have a different opinion about talking too much and mind you you've said a lot today
[01:22:02] so don't be you know don't get crazy over it will stop listening
[01:22:11] the guy who talks too much no yeah less is more hundred percent go I like it
[01:22:17] I will say it musters when echo's echo's words to the audience
[01:22:23] he always gives an epic speech with we have solicited probably the greatest applause of
[01:22:27] everyone yeah I guess to dig into this a little bit of how to balance that with being a leader
[01:22:35] that talks too much I think you got to pay attention to what the reactions are you're getting
[01:22:39] for people right you got to pay attention to the reactions you're getting for people if the people are not
[01:22:45] totally actively listening to you right if they're not actively listening to you if they're
[01:22:52] taking notes if they're looking at their phone or not taking notes but if they're looking at their phone
[01:22:56] or whatever then you're you're talking too much keep it short keep concise and people will listen to
[01:23:03] you more also that when you say you got to pay attention to yourself that's like a deep one it's
[01:23:10] like you just said it really simply like I just pay attention to yourself I mean you didn't
[01:23:14] say like that but that's what it's telling that's the hardest part right there because a lot of
[01:23:18] times like hey me and life are talking and later it's looking at his phone I'm not thinking
[01:23:22] hey I'm talking too much I'm saying what I'm saying it's not interesting enough so I need so I need to say
[01:23:27] some more cool stuff or I need to be more of this or more of that because I'm losing them kind of thing
[01:23:32] like if I'm losing you the intuitive thought is not to to completely disconnect and stop talking that's
[01:23:38] not the intuitive thought seems like when you're in a situation you got to pay attention to that
[01:23:43] kind of stuff on yourself jocca does this all the time what do I do like buses phone out and
[01:23:48] start so yeah I don't even know whatever actually you know what okay I guess our conversation you know
[01:23:53] you know I do that to Dean and Dean Mr so Dean Dean is oh yeah this is a really important
[01:24:00] stuff we're talking about here is like yeah no what Dean does always he it makes him mad right he's
[01:24:04] got the he's got the pet peeve so Dean will be telling something and so you're doing a purpose to get
[01:24:10] a excuse no sometimes he's saying some rambling stuff right and I've got stuff going on Dean
[01:24:17] come on I know you're listening to this bro but sometimes he'll be saying something to me and all
[01:24:22] of the sudden I'll like look around up and and now I realize I'll just be watching people do
[01:24:27] do you just because we're normally on the map what this happens so he's telling me something like
[01:24:31] looking at the eyes and he's like you know in the ancient bubble bubble boy he'll be telling me
[01:24:36] about the Peloponnesian more something or whatever and and as I'm listening to him I'll kind of
[01:24:42] look and I'll start looking at someone that's training or looking at someone and he'll like attack
[01:24:46] me he went through a period where he would just attack me and like take me down and just start
[01:24:53] you know going psycho on me so that got me tuned up I got me tuned up where I tried to give Dean
[01:24:59] some more attention yeah I like that yeah I think that's uh I think that's a good
[01:25:03] cause that's what you feel like when he starts doing that sort of the brats you what you're doing
[01:25:07] you know well the thing is though and I think you're in the same boat late for where I know
[01:25:12] you kind of know now like in everyday life with other people you might think I mean intuitively
[01:25:17] anyway like on losing them or whatever but you can tell with him if he starts doing that stuff you're like
[01:25:22] okay he's the most stop or yeah move on or something but it's all because you know the same
[01:25:27] as I listen if you can give me 35 more seconds we'll be honest and if you can move on to whatever you need to
[01:25:34] bad character or something that I have where I can do that sometimes I'm done listening to you
[01:25:39] so wrap it up of course you see all the time yeah just your one time asmba system all right
[01:25:46] next question for life this is a guy who have he won you know what all right life
[01:25:55] in and out burger or what a burger dude I do not want to go there man that is too much
[01:26:04] that's like double rainbow too much right this is uh I gotta I gotta tell you look obviously
[01:26:13] I'm from Texas water burgers are all over the place and water burgers are awesome you can't
[01:26:17] go wrong with the water burger um in and out is uh it's pretty tough to be though it's uh there's
[01:26:22] something special about the internet I used to have you know over Pacific Beach I had a storage unit
[01:26:27] over there and there's like my storage unit was like right in and up or a hill those are good burgers
[01:26:36] the uh my storage unit was it would like kick the exhaust or like right back up into
[01:26:42] and so so like the exhaust blasting in your face you know from like 25 yards 30 yards away
[01:26:48] as I'm like there at my storage unit on the server for whatever and I was like double double we're
[01:26:54] getting some double double so yeah internet is awesome it's it's tough to beat I'm a huge fan
[01:26:58] internet I will say this though where's the meat man come on those burgers you gotta put
[01:27:04] what a burger you gotta a lot more more patty yeah well apparently you're not a working in the triple triple
[01:27:09] that's what we need quadruple quadruple yeah that's what we got there my my kids after they
[01:27:16] would cut weight for wrestling season I spent more money in an out burger during wrestling season
[01:27:22] because after they cut weight and then they rest all day and then you're going home and all they
[01:27:26] want to do is go in an out burger in an out burger yeah it's it cutting weight for me is the
[01:27:32] very I mean playing football is like maybe one of these big and fabulous plastic and this is
[01:27:36] crush food yeah check all right speaking of well like a speaking of combat sports
[01:27:42] next question six this is your jitz of question should instructors not teach white belts
[01:27:53] aka lathe babbin david berk and jp to nail that's cold blood it's a good deal to you that is
[01:27:59] good deal to you they should instructors not teach white belts certain techniques or should
[01:28:08] why they shouldn't do them be explained but still expose the white belts to techniques
[01:28:14] set the white belts recognize them so there's some techniques that you don't get taught very often
[01:28:19] as a white belt for instance a heel look I believe that it is good to not teach people a
[01:28:26] teach white belts to do heel hooks because the for example heel hooks can be very dangerous
[01:28:33] the reason that they're dangerous because they don't hurt a lot before they injure you and so white belts
[01:28:39] who are by nature completely insane and going crazy and going nuts and so when they get a
[01:28:46] hold of something they just go as hard as they can and by the way they're usually going against the
[01:28:49] white belt that's the only reason they're getting anything on them because they're going
[01:28:51] against white belt and that other white belt's going completely insane and he's not going to tap
[01:28:55] and so what happens you get the triple triple lindi right ACL MCL PCL tear game over
[01:29:03] this guy's never trained in jjitsu again or this guy's not trained in jjitsu for two years or
[01:29:07] whatever so is it smart to not teach them yes it is however dichotomy balance should you just
[01:29:17] never show them what they are no you should you should explain to them hey this is what the move is this is
[01:29:22] this is why we don't teach them this is why we don't teach them because you can get hurt
[01:29:26] and when you get a little bit more advanced and you learn to relax a little bit more we'll teach
[01:29:29] you some of these these techniques that are slightly more dangerous do you know he's freaks out because
[01:29:36] saying that a heel hook is more dangerous than a then a comira I mean if you ask me what I want
[01:29:42] to have somebody just go berserk on a cus cumira on me or a heel hook I'd probably pick the heel
[01:29:47] hook right because then you you still have shoulder mobility whereas cumira that's that's just
[01:29:53] if someone goes nuts on a cumira and just rip your arm up your shoulder apart what would you
[01:29:57] rather have yeah I'm thinking to put all day long so but for some reason it's kind of a rough choice
[01:30:04] there that is a rough choice that is a rough choice that's not a choice you want to be making
[01:30:09] because either one of them's not good but I think you can do a better job of replacing the knee
[01:30:13] and getting the knee squared away then you can the shoulder there's no the shoulders tough but for
[01:30:19] some reason the cumira is everyone you're learning cumira day one right day three you're learning
[01:30:24] cumira and you could definitely trash someone shoulder but it hurts it does hurt been that's
[01:30:30] beneficial yeah I need the shoulders gonna have a way more flexibility than your little your knee
[01:30:36] twisting joint you like that's that you can't be like hey I'm so I'm gonna let you get some
[01:30:40] jump double jump to your knees of bone and you actually right show you guys who can you
[01:30:46] shoulder you know just varying levels of shoulder flexibility and then that also goes for like the
[01:30:51] pain tolerance as well knees last way less from from a wide bill perspective there's so much
[01:30:57] to to learn I mean it's you know and the more I train the more I realize how little I actually
[01:31:02] know and how much more there is that I mean why I would I would I would I would rather focus on you know
[01:31:09] on the more the more foundational aspects of the game and until I can get those a little bit better
[01:31:14] I think that makes a lot of sense to me I think you might be the bull white belt right now of the
[01:31:18] world so in the in the navy the ensin which is the lowest ranking ensin at a ship or a seal
[01:31:26] team he gets called the bull ensin which means he's been the junior guy for the longest amount of
[01:31:32] time and you've been trained she's your footer quite some would you well you start training with me
[01:31:37] in 2005 right yep can you train before me with Fabio I train a few times okay so you've been trained
[01:31:44] since oh three oh four that's been a long time bro most of that's 14 years most of that 14 years
[01:31:53] I'd say I've been seriously training for you know probably probably like back at it you know
[01:31:58] pretty consistently you know multiple times a week for year and a half okay so yours year in
[01:32:03] the zone you're in the zone you be getting that blue belt you at some point Todd White down in Texas
[01:32:08] I'm gonna crack it out possibly I don't know maybe you're not ready though I'll make my dad wait
[01:32:13] Todd White I'm definitely not ready he's the good you going no you got nothing you got nothing
[01:32:20] check so yeah that's I think the deal same thing with same thing uh the other problem with teaching
[01:32:27] a person for instance he'll hooks is then they think that that's the solution to the guard
[01:32:32] and it's not the solution to the guard it's a solution to the guard it's a one possible one one
[01:32:40] one small possible one a solution there's many many more and there's others as you said
[01:32:45] life that are more fundamental so it's that's my that's my answer yeah that thing um how you say
[01:32:53] the like let them know what it is yeah and well when you consider an actual typical White belt class
[01:32:59] they hook it's probably not gonna be introduced in any significant capacity yeah at all like no one's
[01:33:04] gonna choose to spend time in a White belt class to teach a hill yeah typically is not gonna happen
[01:33:09] but like the control thing right like you know you get a even a good blue belt is been in for a
[01:33:14] long time per belt up purple belt and up they're gonna know the control on a hill hook like if I
[01:33:19] you know purple belt doesn't heal hook on you the risk of you getting injured unless you don't
[01:33:24] tap or something like that is pretty low it's gonna be pretty low because they know that control of just
[01:33:29] their whole body and you don't know you should tap exactly right yeah so the White belt they don't
[01:33:33] even have control very important they don't have control or they have a lot less control in everything
[01:33:39] by the way there's a strong possibility there's a strong person but that's with everything like
[01:33:45] even on a defending a take down it's like so odd a couple as a blue belt I heal hook to a friend of mine
[01:33:52] and I heard him and I didn't it wasn't even he was he was a no nothing right and we're going and
[01:34:01] I just started learning hill hooks and I put a hill hook on him and we were overseas and I put a hill
[01:34:07] hook on him and he wasn't tapping and I was kind of like well that's weird you know why is
[01:34:12] he tapping so I went a little bit harder and then all of a sudden there was a little pop and I let
[01:34:16] go and I was like and yeah but you know he was a seal and so he was like all this is gonna work on me
[01:34:23] he doesn't hurt and all of a sudden so I I wasn't going nuts because like I said I was a blue belt
[01:34:27] I was in pretty good control but even I didn't realize at that time oh this will injure him before it will
[01:34:36] cause pain which is a bad thing to have yeah these kids I mean he's guys if they're
[01:34:42] no one has control over anything by the way any any other moves and they're doing hill hooks as a
[01:34:48] normal thing like oh yeah we do we got taught this and stuff and it's effective you know like a
[01:34:52] lot of submissions and hill hooks and a lot of foot locks are one of those ones where you to gain
[01:34:57] the position to go for that submission you have to work a lot less than like an arm bar where you
[01:35:03] have to actually pass someone's guard and you know getting even side control but a lot of times get
[01:35:07] to the you know you got to work more to get into the position with hill hooks not not not so much
[01:35:11] like that so if you know yeah you can just throw it out there and you throw in the lack of control yeah
[01:35:17] man so you increase the chance for injury for sure all right next question I am a 66 year old
[01:35:26] police chief and CrossFit athlete is your muster doable for me absolutely there'll be plenty of
[01:35:35] people who are in your age group and there's no question that you should come and join us for
[01:35:42] monster get after if you're your police chief across for athlete you can more more than get after
[01:35:47] with the the 445 club workouts are voluntary we usually have I mean we probably have what you know 80
[01:35:54] 85% of our participation I mean is massive but they're they're designed so that really anybody can
[01:35:59] do we have people with top level athletes down to you know folks who look like the private
[01:36:04] men of the gym hold on yeah we have the fact you started to get so I remember one guy that was
[01:36:09] I'm heading in for doubled knee surgery in a week and so I'm just and he was an older guy you know
[01:36:13] then had been out of the gym for a bit and he was out there like you said that the the workouts are
[01:36:19] scaleable to the individual that's participating in the in the event and so we at all every level
[01:36:26] you can come to the monster in any literally in any physical condition you can come to the
[01:36:30] monster and you can you can get after it with us next question I find meetings of greater than
[01:36:42] or equal to eight people far less productive than smaller groups even with structured action
[01:36:51] oriented agenda is there a maximum amount of people you'd involve in a strategic or tactical planning group
[01:37:03] I don't think I don't think there is a maximum amount I think it just has to be controlled
[01:37:06] and you've got to have you've got to have some decentralized command or people understand if there's
[01:37:11] just a bunch of people that meeting and everyone's kind of speaking in turn and talking over
[01:37:16] each other you're not going to get anything done so you got to have there's got to be one
[01:37:19] leader who's run that there's got to be some some you know some other subordinate leaders that
[01:37:24] and one person has got to drive that meeting and make sure that when someone starts going
[01:37:29] in down a rabbit hole okay you guys have a sidebar conversation afterward let's keep this meeting
[01:37:34] focused and let's and ultimately the decision maker who can focus the team on a single course of action
[01:37:40] get her by behind them I agree and there's certainly times where you can bring too many people
[01:37:45] into trying to figure something out I mean that can certainly happen and we we have the good idea
[01:37:48] fairies that keep coming around with their good ideas and cause I don't know what if we did this
[01:37:52] I wonder if we did that there's also an interesting dynamic that you just pointed out that ties into a
[01:37:56] question that we had earlier or something that we were talking about earlier which is okay so let's
[01:38:02] say we have a meeting and there's 15 people in that meeting if the leader of that meeting then
[01:38:08] we'll say steps down into the position of being the the director of the meeting itself
[01:38:18] he guess what he's doing all the time he's talking he's pulling things he's get and what he's doing
[01:38:22] while he's doing that is he's getting in the weeds of what's going on so as he's getting in the weeds
[01:38:27] of what's going on he's losing this strategic vision and so if there's 20 people in a meeting
[01:38:32] and you as the leader are going okay what do you think what do you think what do you think
[01:38:36] and hey no let's get it focused when you're doing all that traffic copying you're actually
[01:38:41] losing your strategic altitude you're not going to be able to see and make a good clear decision
[01:38:46] so if there's 30 40 50 people in a meeting and you as the leader get down in the weeds
[01:38:53] and get down in the trenches and you start throwing down with everyone well it's not going to take
[01:38:58] very long well you're just you're just one of the troops and you don't see anything where is if you
[01:39:02] let let one of the other leaders let one of the subordinate leaders let them step up let them start to
[01:39:08] do their thing let them do the direction of the meeting you might even tell them hey run this meeting
[01:39:12] I would do that I'd be like hey you run this meeting and then you let them get in there and the
[01:39:17] trenches and let them try and sort out ideas and they're mind gets filled with a bunch of crap and meanwhile
[01:39:22] you're in the meeting you're just not running it so there's a big difference between running the meeting
[01:39:27] and overseeing the meeting or being in the meeting or being a leading leader of the meeting so
[01:39:32] if we're going through a kill house or if we're going if we're going through a kill house that's a
[01:39:37] good example which is the you know the room with the building with a bunch of rooms and it if
[01:39:41] as the leader you don't say hey I'm gonna run this kill house I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
[01:39:47] direct the movement through the kill house because then guess what you're doing you're directing
[01:39:51] the movement through the kill house what you want to do is take a step back and say hey you
[01:39:56] third, fourth, fifth in the chain of command you run this kill house you run the train and now
[01:40:03] that guy goes okay cool I got it and now while he's running the train doing the work you're
[01:40:08] step back and out too you can see what's going on you can hear the frustration you can hear
[01:40:12] shots fired you know where people are moving then you become you're the real leader so
[01:40:18] same thing in a meeting the dynamics of the meeting or you get more than 10 people 15 people
[01:40:22] and what you're doing is you're down there directing traffic it's gonna be really problematic
[01:40:26] for you if you have a meeting with 15 or 20 people and you tell someone else to direct the meeting
[01:40:33] and run the meeting and you take a step up and you simply observe you're gonna have a better time
[01:40:41] feeling like the meeting is effective and you will get the benefit of hearing all these different
[01:40:45] voices which is good which is good to hear all these different opinions and voices and be able to pick
[01:40:50] through and sort through and that's gonna give you more benefit than you know what I get there's
[01:40:55] two it's going on this meeting only give me two people and we'll make the decisions well there's
[01:40:58] some people number number the six person that person had a good input right the 12 person might
[01:41:04] had some good input so again is there balance yes are there certain decisions that you kind of
[01:41:09] need to take and really dive down in with a small group absolutely but is it good sometimes to let
[01:41:16] things air out and let someone run a meeting and you listen and you learn kind of what the overall
[01:41:21] atmosphere is in the situation are absolutely that's my answer I think it's a great one it helps
[01:41:27] people it helps people listen to you as well right I mean when if you're the boss and you're just
[01:41:32] sitting back and you're not saying anything and then all of a sudden you're like hey guys we're
[01:41:35] getting way off topic here this is what we need to do here's the direction we need to go got it everyone's
[01:41:40] you know back on track whereas if you're in the middle of it then yeah people are just automatically
[01:41:45] you know kind of doing there I'm sure we said this before and I know we talked about it really
[01:41:47] to be like when I would say something on the radio and task unit bruiser when I would say like a
[01:41:52] legitimate thing man it would happen if I got on and said everyone get the building 34 now people would
[01:41:59] go and one of my favorite things to do one of my favorite conversations to have on the radio
[01:42:04] with with either you or stoner was like I remember you'd be like you'd say hey Jocco we got another
[01:42:10] mover where I want to take down building 34 and I'd come up and go do it that was all I'd ever
[01:42:15] said be like do it and I just like go because I'm not trying to talk right I got these guys got
[01:42:21] their situation tandled hey he's going outside of something that we planned hey Jocco want to
[01:42:26] build a move to building 34 and take that thing down do it not well why do you want to do that you
[01:42:32] know why he wants to do it because he's got a good reason he's not asking me that because it's a
[01:42:35] fantasy that he thinks it's going to be cool no there's a reason and he'll explain that to me later
[01:42:40] and if it was something where he's like I want to you know start doing jumping jacks out here
[01:42:44] then I might ask why because that doesn't make my sense to me but to say hey we're hitting
[01:42:49] building 34 as well what if we were doing burpees with that make more sense that makes a little
[01:42:54] more sense little more sense than jumping jacks look that that actually worked it worked for us
[01:43:01] when you when you said some of the radio like got it we're good like it the decision made
[01:43:05] everyone's on board and I think it's it's something that you've got to you've got to focus on
[01:43:12] with like when a leader talks it should matter and and I think you can be you got to be really
[01:43:16] careful about that and I've certainly been a chief violator that of like going off a two to
[01:43:21] too many different directions but that you did extremely well at Tassian bruiser and it works
[01:43:26] and every later should be very Congress of them yeah the last you talked the more people listen
[01:43:30] all right next in a in a middle management position what's the best way to support the company
[01:43:42] and leadership you work for while still showing your fellow workers they are supported and appreciated
[01:43:51] I work in surgery at a large hospital within even larger corporation
[01:43:58] this is one of those things and I remember saying I'm sure I got this from hackworth but it's one of
[01:44:03] those things that I've said so many times I actually probably forget to even give credit to hackworth
[01:44:08] but you know when problems little problems would arise up the chain of command and I'd be like
[01:44:13] everyone hates the echelon of command above them right that's the way it is like and that's just
[01:44:19] the way it is that's the way it is it's always they don't get it so they don't understand
[01:44:24] unless you get somebody that really knows how to explain and communicate down the chain of
[01:44:29] commands that everyone understands why they're doing what they're doing that's what this is that's
[01:44:33] exactly what this is like if it what's the best way to support the company leadership it's to
[01:44:38] take what the company and the leadership of the company says and translate it to the troops
[01:44:43] in a way that they understand and that means something to them right so you go to a big meeting
[01:44:50] and you know like let's say in all hands meeting for a company and and the CEO is saying
[01:44:58] hey we made you know we made 87 million dollars last year profit and if all the front line
[01:45:03] troops are in there they're like well that's cool but I didn't see that reflected in my pay
[01:45:12] check by the way you gave me a $4 raise over the last three years how about some of that 87
[01:45:18] million kick it down to the people so that's problematic because we aren't explaining hey good that's
[01:45:24] it that literally that statement right there will actually make people mad the the the the CEO's
[01:45:29] thinking everyone's gonna love me because I'm telling how profitable we are as a company all
[01:45:33] everyone's thinking as a little bit why can't you afford to buy me that piece of gear that we
[01:45:36] need on the front lines what's your problem that's so you actually think you're helping but you're
[01:45:41] actually hurting unless you can explain to people look we made this much profit here's how it's
[01:45:46] gonna benefit us as a company and you as a front line troop by us making this much money it means
[01:45:51] we can grow these areas it means we can bring on more people that means everyone in this room right
[01:45:55] now in the next three years you're gonna have an opportunity to be in a leadership position that's
[01:45:59] why I'm talking about that's why we're trying to grow that's why we're trying to do better by the way
[01:46:03] as we this is snowballing even more because now we're putting more money into advertising we've got
[01:46:07] whole advertising campaign that's going out we've invested a bunch of money in that and it's gonna
[01:46:11] bring us more business and that means the jobs that you think might not be stable your job if you
[01:46:15] don't think it's stable it just got stable because we have the capital to get this machine moving
[01:46:21] even faster so when you do that when you explain to the troops why something's happening it makes
[01:46:28] them understand and it shows your people hey you're supporting are there times where you should push back
[01:46:35] yes there are and if something makes no sense whatsoever you should raise your hand it's hey
[01:46:40] let me let me let me run this up the chain of command let me run this up the chain of command and
[01:46:44] explain why this is in a good idea and that way you can go and when you get the reason because they'll
[01:46:49] be a reason and it might not be the best reason but it'll be a reason and you go back to troops and
[01:46:53] say hey here's why this is going on this is what's happening this is the decision they made
[01:46:57] and you know what we're gonna do our best to execute it because that's what we do we make things happen
[01:47:02] we're gonna get it done boom and we got a great we've got a great depiction of that in
[01:47:08] and talking about being humble not passive and pushing back where it matters in the deck out of
[01:47:13] me leadership that's that whole section is talking exactly about that it's a very hard thing
[01:47:18] you know for people and that the the basis of this question though is the us versus them right front
[01:47:23] lines versus corporate headquarters and you've got to defeat that if you're a good leader you
[01:47:29] got to recognize look we're all the same team we can't do what we need to do without having the
[01:47:34] support and you know the resources and the approvals a plans from the corporate headquarters you know
[01:47:41] and corporate headquarters it oftentimes so not only are is there frustration up the chain there's
[01:47:47] also frustration down the chain you hear that all the time like will the front lines it will
[01:47:50] really get it they don't get it over there well listen from the front lines is where the actual
[01:47:55] mission gets one lost yeah so you you've got to you might want to have them on board with the
[01:48:00] big example so you got to make sure that you know that it's got to if you want to successful team
[01:48:04] you you can't have us versus them ever to get on board for the big win yeah the full metal jacket
[01:48:10] right what's your problem son once you get on board for the big win and and you think oh well
[01:48:15] if i'm the general and i'm telling this young guy that's got a peace sign on this helmet
[01:48:19] that represents the dichotomy maybe that's where i learn the word dichotomy from that represents the
[01:48:24] dichotomy of what does he say that dichotomy again he says the duality of duality of man yeah
[01:48:29] you're right that represents the duality of man what did you take that thing off and get on board
[01:48:34] for the big win and that's such a great line from that move join the team son get on board for the
[01:48:39] big win that's such a great line from that movie because that's exactly what we're talking about
[01:48:42] that does absolutely nothing for that front line soldier that goes okay you're saying that
[01:48:48] and i'm literally bearing people right now in this situation and so for you saying that to me means
[01:48:53] nothing in fact it shows how completely freaking out a touch you are and so they did a great job
[01:48:58] in that movie of representing that through one single line it won't just get on board for the
[01:49:03] big win it's like no actually why don't you lead how does that sound so communicate up and down
[01:49:13] jinnic man make sure people know why and tie in why it matters to them next question
[01:49:22] in extreme ownership you talk about being close with the team but not so close that they forget
[01:49:27] who's in charge or that the good of the team suffers how do you overcome the isolation of leadership
[01:49:34] what strategies did or do you employ to avoid the isolation becoming an issue this is an example
[01:49:44] of i'm gonna take this to the extreme hey i'm not gonna be too close to my people guess what i'm
[01:49:51] not talking to them right i'm not gonna speak to them i'm gonna i'm gonna maintain a distance
[01:49:55] i'm gonna and it's it's obviously not true it's obviously not true and i think you know
[01:50:00] the the relations that you and me and Seth and the that we all had was clearly uh this right
[01:50:07] i wasn't alone i wasn't isolated as the leader because we were all bros and hanging out and
[01:50:13] now didn't start off like that no you know i as we always talk about like i come across a hack
[01:50:17] worth style of like hey we're not gonna joke around for at least whatever six to eight weeks to make
[01:50:21] sure that these dudes are good to go and that that they understand where i'm coming from and and
[01:50:28] that's cool but once we get through that okay like then it's like open up a little bit then it's like
[01:50:32] open up a little bit more and then it's up a little bit more so that you're not isolated at the
[01:50:36] top because not only is it important that you're not isolated that's like that's like a marginal thing
[01:50:42] what's more important is what i talked about earlier is if you if life can't come to me and say
[01:50:48] hey man hey i don't agree with this plan or more importantly hey jockel here's what's going on
[01:50:53] with the troops right now here's what's going on with the mentality here's what's going on with the
[01:50:57] morale if he can't knock on my door and say that to me then that's a real problem because now um you
[01:51:05] know i'm i'm in the dark on what's happening inside inside with the troops which is problematic
[01:51:12] yeah i think it's this to me sounds like uh i was thinking about this question and
[01:51:17] it sounds to me like uh maybe a junior leader that was promoted at the chain because that's where
[01:51:21] you really feel like when i go from you know the assistant buto commander where i'm like kind of one
[01:51:24] of the boys and i'm you know where we can you know it's kind of uh i can kind of play interference
[01:51:30] with it with the officer and charge and the buto commander now so i get promoted it's you recognize
[01:51:35] instantly there's a little bit of difference you've got to maybe kind of distance yourself a slightly
[01:51:39] from where you were previously in recognized when you took over charlie buto and i was the
[01:51:43] buto commander when did you realize you needed to transition from being one of the boys until
[01:51:48] being the o i seen that there was that the gap was going to open up a little bit was it as soon as
[01:51:53] you took over it was pretty quick because i've been to buds uh and uh seal qualification training
[01:51:58] you know as future advanced training with uh with several guys uh and i knew these guys very well
[01:52:03] and you know i think we had a big house party hanging out you know having a good time and and
[01:52:08] uh everybody's over at my house and all of a sudden I realized some i did all the time you know
[01:52:12] as an assistant to the new commander and all of a sudden uh we're in it work you know the next
[01:52:16] week and i got to uh make some some tough calls and we got to get you know drive the standards
[01:52:21] a little bit higher where we're at and they're supposed back and you realize like okay when it's
[01:52:26] when it's time to give some people some bad news or say hey we're not doing as good as we should
[01:52:29] we need to fix that and they kind of give you the leg hey bro you know what are you doing
[01:52:34] Friday you know like then it's then you're like okay i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to distance
[01:52:37] a little bit but the the isolation you should never be isolated i think that's one thing that
[01:52:43] you know i remember coming into your office and uh i'm coming in hang out all the time in your
[01:52:48] office you know you you you come in hang out in the between space i mean i've come you know we
[01:52:52] we'd see each other in the gym we're like we're always trying to find a way to like hang out and talk
[01:52:57] and and um it was even even when you know Seth's known was all we're across the the other side of
[01:53:02] the city i mean you know we'd still connect with him and talk to him with the phone and what's
[01:53:05] well yeah well i talked about time on the uh and dvt yeah you guys you guys talk right
[01:53:12] but but haven't but even even you know yeah we'd always we he came by like we'd always
[01:53:16] try to try to get together and talk to each other and catch up with us in the chow haul or
[01:53:20] our uh you know in in the between space and you know gas like i've ever told you would come
[01:53:25] with our ad come in i'd walk in and i'd see the wind plan written up on chowco's whiteboard
[01:53:30] the task in it roser or Tony had written down all the things that we needed to do to wind and
[01:53:35] rabadi which were pretty harsh yes true but probably on the probably on the level like gangas
[01:53:41] common certainly had a great news that gangas common wind plan which you know what hey man but
[01:53:46] we are as it's marron we are we are joking laughing about that this is the relationship juggle had
[01:53:50] you know not only with me but with with with other leaders in the task unit and uh and i think you
[01:53:54] have to have that i mean you you've got to have a you've got to have a relationship with your people
[01:53:58] um you can't think that i can't talk to anyone i can't interact with anyone i think this you're
[01:54:02] gonna be unsuccessful leader um you know if if uh you try to roll that way it's just not gonna
[01:54:07] work yeah i think where you might feel what might feel like a isolation which is definitely true
[01:54:13] and this is the burden of command right like guess what you your friends with life your friends
[01:54:18] with Seth your friends with Tony your friends with these guys but at the same time like oh the burden
[01:54:23] of command is on you and it's gonna be it's gonna be you you're gonna you're gonna bear that right
[01:54:30] in your cartoon it's like hey you got your assistant to two commands you got your
[01:54:33] patron chief you got your LPO but when something goes wrong if something goes wrong if you
[01:54:41] if there's a bat if something happens on a mission it goes bad i'm not talking i'm not i'm not
[01:54:45] looking at the assistant platoon commander i'm i'm looking at you that's the burden of command that's
[01:54:51] so that thing yeah that's the there's one man that stands on the carpet right that's that's the
[01:54:56] way it works and sometimes being one man that's that's a little bit of a nice lady feeling
[01:55:01] and to help help you understand our leading petty officer charlotte batoon awesome awesome amazing
[01:55:06] CEO love the guy and uh help he could be on here one of these days but after the debut
[01:55:10] year is retirement comes one one of these days but uh he was i'm at we were we were up in
[01:55:17] navaa training and uh we took a couple days to go snowboarding which was an awesome good deal and
[01:55:26] he like we're in the vanny looks around he like sees me he's like i'm not the senior guy in charge
[01:55:32] and uh so he's screaming a laugh and about how awesome it is to nong be the senior guy because he
[01:55:37] knows the burden of command is now with me and now with him if uh guys get trouble or do something
[01:55:42] we should have done yeah yeah which is while you're in toho guys getting in trouble and doing
[01:55:48] stuff stupid it's probably a fairly likely thing to have at highly valuable that's one of my
[01:55:55] favorite trips that I did multiple times yeah so that's it man build relationships and at the same
[01:56:01] time you are when you're in charge you're in charge and there's a little bit of uh that's called
[01:56:06] the burner command embrace it and we got time for one more question here you go in life and
[01:56:17] jocos opinion you've been excluded from this one echo troughs they don't want your opinion
[01:56:24] what has changed or what point do you find you need to emphasize more from when you wrote
[01:56:32] extreme ownership to now well this is a softball question that I selected he said all the
[01:56:37] easy ones well yeah I think the answer to this one's pretty obvious that's why we wrote the book
[01:56:42] that kind of a leadership I mean this is uh this is what we had needed to emphasize more and just as
[01:56:49] you know you talked about this when we were talking about jaws to you know whether now you know the
[01:56:54] sequel is gonna be as good and you know we had we had pressured a right a book he's trying
[01:56:57] to be very well like hey guys you're right in the book we didn't want to write in the book until we
[01:57:02] actually had something useful to write about that would impact leaders for the better help them be
[01:57:07] better people better leaders lead better teams lead better lives and and that's what this is type
[01:57:12] the decadent leadership answers uh the most difficult challenges and and obstacles that we see
[01:57:17] leaders face and I think that three years you know one thing that is your motion did for us is
[01:57:23] I mean our company blew up as a result echelon front we were able to work with so many more leaders and
[01:57:28] so many more companies and we got to see this over and over and over and over and over again and
[01:57:34] and this uh this is capturing those those issues uh that that we saw uh and then the solutions
[01:57:40] to solve most problems to leadership yeah I think it's gonna be pretty evident I think it was cool
[01:57:45] how it revealed itself as the subject matter of the next book I mean we we like you
[01:57:52] said business blew up yes we were busy we weren't really sitting there going okay watch the next
[01:57:58] book we read about watch the next book be about we actually we didn't even think of we weren't
[01:58:03] even thinking about it and then as we started saying you know people don't understand this as well
[01:58:09] hey we we should have added more chapters about the dichotomy we and it's like over time all
[01:58:16] of us on it became very it became completely blatantly obvious that what people needed help with
[01:58:23] was this most difficult thing which is achieving the balance of all the different dichotomies
[01:58:29] of leadership and that's why we wrote the dichotomy leadership gets on right on well or
[01:58:36] just hitting that two hour mark which means we only have two hours for echo to talk about support
[01:58:42] you said echo was a school for that last question but I want to know what your answer is echo
[01:58:50] from uh oh yeah what you've learned since extreme ownership comes out since the podcast is launched
[01:58:55] okay so the the main thing that sticks out main thing is that is what people seem to ask you all
[01:59:02] the time is what do I do when other people aren't taking extreme ownership and here's thing when
[01:59:07] you're outside and listening you're like a high see what you know it's almost like a funny
[01:59:11] question right because like what what do you call that like ironic right kind of or they're like what
[01:59:15] do you do when other people but it's you the one supposed to you know so that's it but the reason
[01:59:20] that that significant is because when you're in the situation that's exactly what it feels like you
[01:59:25] can't like really see it seems to me so you got a detach which kind of kind of shed more even more
[01:59:31] light on the uh the importance of detaching right so it kind of feeds into itself but so yeah when
[01:59:38] you're in the situation and you have to essentially take ownership when the other person should
[01:59:45] be taking ownership but actually in your mind the other person hey you need to take responsibility
[01:59:50] for this that's the time you gotta take responsibility of it yeah it's hard to like it's hard to
[01:59:55] really grasp that in the beginning I thought well that was pretty cool recently we got an email
[01:59:59] from a guy that's overseas running a company and he he listened to Dave Burke and and Neil did
[02:00:07] yeah good deal Dave and I think it's a great example to say can you take ownership of the weather
[02:00:12] right because the obvious answer is no I can't take ownership of the weather and I talk about this
[02:00:15] on that podcast is like well actually you can yeah because you can come over contingency plans you can
[02:00:19] come up with you can stage your force forward closer and so anyways this guy in his company
[02:00:25] it's a software type company and implementation company and they piggyback on a big giant you know
[02:00:31] one of the biggest companies in the world and that biggest company in the world one of the biggest
[02:00:37] companies in the world made some errors and it messed up their platform and they went to their
[02:00:44] clients and hey the platform got messed up it was the big guys they did this this and this wrong
[02:00:50] and the people were like oh well okay you know I guess and then he went home and he listened to
[02:00:57] that podcast and he went I screwed up because that's hey the biggest company in the world is still
[02:01:03] easier to control than the weather right and so he went back to the company and he went back to the
[02:01:10] his client and said you know what it wasn't their fault it was our fault it was my fault
[02:01:15] here's some things I'm gonna put in place so that this never happens again and all of a sudden
[02:01:21] the attitude completely changes and the client is super happy and is all of his team also because
[02:01:26] what does that do to your team when you blame when you blame the weather your team just goes okay
[02:01:30] we got a permanent excuse now whether wasn't good c's were too big when was too high cloud
[02:01:35] cover was too low whatever the case maybe you got a permanent excuse now because you can't control
[02:01:38] the weather actually wrong wrong we they control the weather we we will set up our missions we will
[02:01:45] set up our contingencies that no matter what the weather does where you do a conference the mission
[02:01:49] no matter what our big whatever wouldn't no matter what the big platform that we rely on no matter
[02:01:54] what happens with them we're gonna be in control that's how we roll get some that feedback was
[02:01:59] phenomenal and here you know saying that his client was like I've never seen anyone handle a
[02:02:03] problem I guess before you guys have done an amazing job and it's it's another example of how
[02:02:08] you're you're scared to take ownership and yet by taking ownership you're building trust
[02:02:13] you're building trust and you win it when when you take ownership and you actually get the problem
[02:02:17] solve going for speaking of ownership and taking ownership maybe I could take ownership but you know
[02:02:25] support sure be happy to how to support you know people's selves sells the path really that's what
[02:02:34] we're supporting the path right right on the path you're on the path all right if you're not on the path
[02:02:39] I'm well actually somebody requested a picture of just a sign that said please stay on the path yeah that's
[02:02:45] good yeah yeah exactly right and I was gonna say if you're not on the path we're not talking to you but if you're not on the path
[02:02:52] I'm I think we're talking to equally maybe more so I want to say more so but really if you're on the path
[02:02:59] when I'm talking to you super loud too so each I think I don't know maybe we'll think about that
[02:03:04] more later we'll go into origin right our company origin main dot com geese rash guard for
[02:03:15] jujitsu lathe talked about jujitsu earlier awesome stuff yeah origin makes the best stuff it's uh
[02:03:21] I've got I think I have like five different you you have the first origin guy I ever
[02:03:28] touched was yours I never echo you as well yeah interesting and I was like dang yeah it was
[02:03:34] it was it the mustard and yeah and the real when you see the weave like on the origin geese they're pattern
[02:03:41] there you can understand you're gonna get so do you have do you have currently do you have any
[02:03:46] other geese that are not origin I have three geese I have one non origin geese okay two origin
[02:03:51] go put that on took put that on and and he says like is a threat put that on see what happens
[02:03:58] boy you would have an emserious could I put on mine I was like oh should I keep this or
[02:04:02] no I put on you know one of my old house like bro I can't I can't wear this like it doesn't
[02:04:06] it's not great don't it those geese I even even at the at the white belt level I can totally tell
[02:04:12] that I roll better in my origin geese oh yes that's that's a whole button well I said that's
[02:04:17] what they felt good he's rolling bad I'm telling you no but there's someone about like the it
[02:04:22] it actually has give to my shoulders I can move in a way that like I with my other geese it's
[02:04:27] it's really tight I can't move and I feel like I don't I actually I seem to be more
[02:04:32] personal and what percentage of increased performance do you achieve wearing an origin
[02:04:38] at least 9% at least thank you no good I actually that is a good point because I had a geese
[02:04:43] like my second geese ever and I was like hey that one looks cool because it had like cool designs
[02:04:47] on it or whatever and it was like thick material for some reason I thought that beefy thick
[02:04:51] material look cool so I got it and it I'm not gonna I'm not gonna name the name of the brand
[02:04:58] so doesn't matter but um yeah when I'm rolling it it feels like more claustrophobic like with
[02:05:03] which we know you have an issue with like did before yeah back in the old days yeah did I
[02:05:08] carry you across the fact I think you were a country that took you to the cure of my class I was rolling
[02:05:13] Andy and we were on with the geese and I was trying to do like a crazy whatever
[02:05:20] lapel not lapel what's the what's the down here like the bottom part of the jacket yeah this is
[02:05:25] so I had Andy and I was trying I was almost just working something and I couldn't I didn't have
[02:05:30] enough jacket out and I was like I was pratoon like I'm an average and make you a thing for you
[02:05:37] but it was the where for him to wear him to wear him to wear a ball with yes exactly and then he was
[02:05:42] doing you know how people drag your jacket and they get between your leg on a single you know what I mean
[02:05:46] just and he's doing he's like that's his game right now and I told him I'm gonna make I have
[02:05:53] origin make a geek from the fence corner so you can grab it so we're gonna rest Taylor tier we
[02:05:57] gotta do it but that makes sense though if you roll better like if you're feeling like you're
[02:06:02] kind of straight check I'm not saying other brands feel like straight check I'm not saying that but I'm
[02:06:06] saying if you have a specific feeling while you're rolling and it's impulsively you're
[02:06:11] the fit of it makes all the troops from it and if you forget like it's not very flexible it's
[02:06:15] it's awesome and it definitely improves your game and it helps you and you look good by the way
[02:06:20] said no also speaking of looking good and feeling good and comfort they do have joggers and
[02:06:26] t-shirts and whatnot most comfortable joggers still today in my experience which is means a lot
[02:06:31] are you getting jogger to wear this jogger? I think joggers yeah even though this is going to be the
[02:06:36] undisputed champion of comfort according to kind of sorry and and rash guards I wear I wear
[02:06:44] the rash guard when I'm working out some days the days I wear it when I'm working out it's long
[02:06:49] sleeve is when I'm doing a lot of stuff on the rings so my arms don't get all chafed up which is a
[02:06:54] comfort move if you break it down just saying yeah well let me finish that let's say the results
[02:07:01] of not having the rash guard imp or impedes or gets in the way of your functionality or something
[02:07:07] like this you know you know how like like some people who wear straps or they'll wear
[02:07:13] I don't know what it oh like some of the 10 of full power lifting suit yeah yeah yeah like
[02:07:20] full thing yeah but that's more of like in it I don't know it's someone else has to put your belt on
[02:07:26] you you know what I'm saying when you're like heaving there's two or three people trying to
[02:07:30] heav the belt in a position yeah yeah I guess no I'm thinking more because like
[02:07:34] compare that to your rash guard scenario right it's like something something that's going to like
[02:07:39] you know people wear those things on their hands so they don't get blisters right so the blisters
[02:07:43] sure you could power through it but if it was measurable what it get in the way of the performance
[02:07:48] the blister if you do rip a call us which sometimes people post rip call us and and I get it like
[02:07:54] you got a good workout in but guess what your tomorrow's workout is not going to be as good
[02:07:58] especially if you think tomorrow the dead list with the rip call us from pull ups
[02:08:01] it's a bad thing you need to go back for some may it's a make sure you don't let this
[02:08:06] call us it's a good question is I'm stoked you got after it but I'm not stoked in the next
[02:08:11] day when you're like not being able to yeah so let's say they work gloves or in your case you
[02:08:16] wear the rash guards is that technically for comfort or is it for you know if you're a state
[02:08:22] functionality yeah yeah yeah I don't I don't know if I could see fit to say that I've witnessed you
[02:08:28] do anything for comfort as far as getting after it goes okay let's go on yeah keep note yeah
[02:08:35] we'll keep looking for now and also what supplements the jacquoise supplements jacquoise
[02:08:40] let's up let's see we got joint warfare we got acrylic oil we got discipline
[02:08:47] joint warfare and krill oils for your joints and now surprisingly alternate fact
[02:08:56] curcumin is also good for your brain function apparently which I could use all the help I can get
[02:09:04] you sure I just I just got an order in a new new replacement order in for some krill oil
[02:09:10] and join warfers yeah wait you're on the discipline trainer now I'm on the discipline train
[02:09:15] I get it this moment I see you got some discipline right at this moment unfortunately I lost
[02:09:19] discipline earlier yeah do this is weird lack of discipline yeah yeah like he he he he made
[02:09:24] discipline and then he lost his discipline I mixed up a huge bottle of discipline of jacquoise house
[02:09:29] and then as we were leaving the come here I'm like what the hell did I do with it I was like
[02:09:33] wait where is your discipline I think your dog is probably getting after it now just like
[02:09:38] a level 19 but you got a back though I see so that's good yeah mulk can't forget about the mulk
[02:09:46] which is the tastiest of all tasties best so this is comfort so you this is a comfort yeah
[02:09:50] yes it's a good is true and I'll be honest with you now maybe I burn myself out of meant
[02:09:56] but I've been going I've been going Richter on TV yeah and then I haven't tried these yet I
[02:10:01] will only have I've got metchak with jacquoise yet that I will go get some out of your
[02:10:04] bit so that you're okay so the chocolate or the peanut butter chocolate comes in right
[02:10:09] oh big hype we're talking about it when's it coming it's supposed to come in this one week
[02:10:13] it took what if you days later whatever big hype comes in everyone's fired up I'm one of those people
[02:10:18] so I'm like boom so I'm pounding uh chocolate peanut butter now pounding it mulk train full
[02:10:23] speed double mulk train it so after a while I'm pounding the peanut butter you know one and
[02:10:29] then I look and I still have that mint one one day I go in I'm gonna make it I see the mint one
[02:10:35] and the mint one it looked like it was looking at me like what did you forget about me you know like
[02:10:38] I was cheating on the mint like I'd left the mint you know so I put the mint one back in and
[02:10:45] I was reminded that that is my favorite one yeah yeah I but they taste good yeah see it's kind of like
[02:10:54] it's kind of like um it's it's ridiculous yeah it's ridiculous that you can just completely eat that
[02:11:01] and just enjoy it yeah my son has been posted I've been re-threading it someone's been posting like
[02:11:06] mulk recipes oh yeah and it are all these different ideas I haven't tried any of them yet because
[02:11:12] I just that's not my thing what do we just put it straight in milk oh no I just put it milk but this
[02:11:17] guy is creating like like cookies ball cookies all kinds of crazy mulk conventions and they look good
[02:11:25] and he's saying they taste good so I don't know I'll give him a try what you do is or what I
[02:11:31] wound up doing is because peanut butter is like in my opinion undiable thing in life peanut butter
[02:11:38] the flavor so the mint chocolate does so I put the peanut butter it's actual peanut butter
[02:11:44] sometimes you can mix one scoop one scoop you know peanut butter chocolate and the mint chocolate
[02:11:48] cool but you've done that oh yeah I'm not all dead that's like crossing the streams and ghost
[02:11:53] busters oh yeah and you know that's how they want the movie that's how they defeated the bed
[02:11:58] that they crosses street so yeah the cream shall stand out of there she do is you put
[02:12:05] peanut butter with the milk one that's do that report back okay if you want hey would at this time
[02:12:12] invite everyone to the immersion camp but it's sold out so I'm sorry uh sign up next year early
[02:12:18] and come hang out with us at the immersion camp check yes also good way to just to support
[02:12:25] jocco has a store it's called jocco store and this is where you can get a peril a peril school right
[02:12:34] yeah fashion is not not cool okay we're in a fashion okay cool a peril but if you want to
[02:12:39] represent it has not well we're doing all right there you go but you will look fashionable if you
[02:12:46] accept the term national jocco doesn't it yeah oh good you look good though I think I don't know
[02:12:51] that's a matter of opinion but if you want to represent that's where you can get shirts rash cards
[02:12:56] hats joccer hats namely joccer hat or flex fit where you at joccer hat see there you go dang
[02:13:06] when the flex fit oh yeah interesting I'm not against it I'm not gonna report back
[02:13:11] I want to know what sells more trucker hat or or flex fit that's an interesting question
[02:13:18] I'll find out what you're doing on that and also got a long comment about hoodies a guy from
[02:13:24] Michigan that works construction said hey jocco just let you know in Michigan we do need
[02:13:32] like wait hoodies oh boom so now I can look everything I've ever said has been disproven now this is
[02:13:39] one man's opinion yes you know well here's the thing about that when you kind of did take a
[02:13:44] step back it's like you you just went extreme you weren't wrong you just went extreme that's all
[02:13:49] you know you don't have to do the balance so this guy in Michigan he had the balance because he
[02:13:56] knows the extreme he knows about the value of the thing who he's in Michigan I gotta say for the
[02:14:00] folks in Michigan though like being up there in North Dakota doing to work like when you go to
[02:14:04] Alaska and you you know it's like pretty cool out and you got your jacket on he's looking
[02:14:09] on there's dudes like T-shirts just hanging out that's where it was it's all relative yeah so
[02:14:13] here's like two like in Maine just where I just where I have he sweatshirt all day long I mean
[02:14:18] all winter long maybe I've occasionally got to throw on some kind of a parka and you know what a
[02:14:23] park is being from Hawaii not sounds yeah so what you do with your car right on the
[02:14:29] Chalker hat flex foot debate out like flex foot I think is great I like flex flex foot hats
[02:14:34] but I will say I got a large melon and being able to adjust is important no particularly when
[02:14:41] you're fishing and you're rolling out and your hat gets blown off and it's then it's so
[02:14:45] can what are they like the largest melon I've ever seen on a human there was a guy on the special
[02:14:51] boat teams who was a great dude he was a big I'll just say Polynesian maybe he was Filipino maybe
[02:14:59] he was Polynesian I don't know but he was something like that right Pacific Islander I guess
[02:15:04] he's head was so big okay you know a protect helmet you know a protect helmet it's a
[02:15:09] protect bike helmet he had one of those for for riding in the boat for like doing operations where
[02:15:15] you got to wear helmet he had one of those and he had all the foam inside of it all of it was gone
[02:15:23] and we still had to like basically grease up his head get that thing on this and it would be
[02:15:29] it was crazy how big his head was huge and he was a great dude but he had a huge head
[02:15:34] he had no protection he just had a little thin he only wore that thing because it was a part of
[02:15:38] the rules right Pacific Islander yeah he could have just called he could have looked I don't need
[02:15:42] to helmet my freaking head helmet knife into thick get away from me I get away from the stupid
[02:15:48] helmet on people all right so he would need the flex fit you know a lot of flex in that fit
[02:15:54] he need a lot of flex in that fit I don't think the truck would fit nonetheless anyway like I said
[02:15:58] jockel store dot com so we can get all this cool my opinion cool stuff so when you made a
[02:16:04] lot of stuff too new stuff is on there yeah jockel white tea there's a shirt so my brother has a
[02:16:10] Pepsi shirt and a garbage or a garbage pale kids yes you know the little cards they're like so
[02:16:17] my twin brother jay he has a garbage pale kid shirt and you'd think as an adult you're like all right
[02:16:25] but it kind of you know it's kind of cool it's cool shirt and then you get it your Pepsi shirt like
[02:16:31] even if you don't drink pepper it just looks cool right so we got a jockel white tea shirt
[02:16:35] so that was not I thought I actually gave you credit in my mind for having an original cool
[02:16:41] because I thought I didn't think it look pretty cool it's yeah and the thing is it does the
[02:16:44] the fact is that concept is a very cool concept I didn't do it because hey Pepsi do it so let's do it
[02:16:49] that's not why I did it let's think that that that concept is cool right oh you don't jockel white
[02:16:53] tea let me get the shirt and it's a tea shirt we call those layers anyway yes some new stuff on there
[02:17:00] oh check out check also good way to support is to subscribe to the podcast if you have
[02:17:08] an already on iTunes Google Play Stitcher you know wherever you where you listen to your podcast
[02:17:14] just subscribe that's a good way to support leave a review and you know you want your kids to listen
[02:17:19] to this podcast but you know you can't because sometimes it's completely inappropriate but for that
[02:17:24] reason we have the warrior kid podcast and that's questions from Uncle Jake or for Uncle Jake
[02:17:30] and so you can get that one to the YouTube we also have a YouTube channel that you can subscribe to
[02:17:37] hey subscribe you know what let's not do this you never watch a YouTube video and they
[02:17:41] end at the end it goes please subscribe and click whatever right click we're not going to do that
[02:17:46] yeah we're not going to do that when you think about it and I don't want to go into a whole
[02:17:50] deep thing here but it seems like as a consumer right that's it is an audience member of
[02:17:56] you or a video is whatever you and it does defeat the whole purpose of clicking like right when you
[02:18:02] like let me ask you how many people do you think get the end of a YouTube video or it says click
[02:18:06] subscribe now to watch more awesome videos how many people does that convince push them over the
[02:18:10] edge and they just can't stop that I don't know but from what I've read before it's like they
[02:18:17] recommend that like that you do that as a content creator is what they call it they say yeah
[02:18:23] hey just ask because people do it kind of thing it's kind of like hey you can't get it if you don't
[02:18:27] ask but it does kind of give you this kind of underlying feeling of like you're asking me to do
[02:18:33] something that's made to be organic it's made to be if you like this video you press like that's
[02:18:39] what that thing is made for and now you're asking me to violate that whole reason that it's made
[02:18:44] so you want me to do it like favor like you like I was watching your video because I thought we were
[02:18:49] just cool I thought we were just having a little moment right a little two minute and 30 second
[02:18:55] moments and then I get to the end of it and now you're coming out saying that I need to do this to
[02:18:59] do that this was now I see what it was it was a setup and I'm not saying that's what people are
[02:19:05] doing I'm not saying that's what you're doing if you're doing that I'm just saying as a consumer
[02:19:10] or as a viewer that's what it kind of feels like well we'll try to avoid that try to do it by just
[02:19:15] saying hey on this podcast go there and subscribe to it that way you won't get bothered with a little
[02:19:20] thing from echo at the end that says please click subscribe to watch more videos from echo
[02:19:25] child i still hear let's put it this way the most the most i'll show you say accurate for like a
[02:19:30] better term way to put it if you didn't know that we have a youtube channel we do if you didn't know
[02:19:39] you could subscribe to it boom now you do if you want to subscribe you can but that goes without saying
[02:19:45] obviously same thing with the like i like it that's a youtube that's you too grab to it yeah
[02:19:52] true also if you're working out you want to switch it up and talk about on it so on it dot com slash
[02:19:59] jockel here's a thing too which i kind of forget to say you get 10% off if you go to this slash
[02:20:04] jockel so go on it dot com slash jockel so when you're buying your kettlebells primal bells
[02:20:09] legend builds rings in you know better of stuff like that go on it dot com slash jockel so you
[02:20:15] can get 10% off really good stuff that good info is well psychological warfare is an album with
[02:20:21] tracks we're working on number two right now so we'll make that happen and i'm getting some good
[02:20:26] requests via the interwebs about what should be on there so iTunes Google Play MP3 platforms you can
[02:20:35] get that psychological warfare album with tracks but what is that for them we're not going to let
[02:20:43] you say it everybody knows what it's for what's it for don't you know what it's for yes it
[02:20:46] knows what it's for it's to combat those moments of weakness that we all have i'm going to make a
[02:20:51] cycle of track about how to not say something that has been said what do you do yeah some
[02:20:59] of course that's something that's not been said yeah beat a dead horse yeah i'm just saying if they if this is the first time they
[02:21:04] they heard it they're going to be like what is that psychological warfare i know what regular
[02:21:08] the traditional psychological warfare is it's kind of like if i kept saying hey jockel white
[02:21:13] tea oh you know what you can you can deadlift 8000 pounds and i kept saying that over and over again
[02:21:17] and never stop saying it that'd be kind of like what you're doing yeah but so it seems like it
[02:21:21] from your perspective but from the perspective someone just tuning in not just turning it over 130
[02:21:27] podcasts the here's the thing they started where if they did they'll go listen to another one they'll
[02:21:31] hear it eventually though and then they'll start to hear it over and over again but for i'm saying
[02:21:35] as an individual count which means more in my opinion okay i think it'll be said all the match yeah that's
[02:21:42] right now no we're getting that's it i like it don't get the amazons cans you can get cans people
[02:21:49] don't know this you can get cans of jockel white tea it's stop drinking other energy drinks that are
[02:21:55] filled with sugar and other crap and get yourself jockel white tea this so you know how there's
[02:22:00] these pre-workouts yeah right you know pre-workout uh thing is right it's like super like it's
[02:22:06] i don't know a pre-workout sorry but i know a pre-workout sorry you know what i'm talking about right
[02:22:12] the one they have like a bunch of caffeine whatever the label is real shiny a lot of the time
[02:22:18] you know what i'm talking about oh you know what you mean with ones that have a light label that's really
[02:22:21] shite yeah i never got a light label but i don't know a lot of that yeah all right so let me ask you this
[02:22:28] if i have a jockel white tea in a can yeah it's cold yeah right very refreshing
[02:22:34] and then i put some of that energy uh pre-workout in it since it doesn't have that much caffeine
[02:22:39] and i was maybe looking for some caffeine if i put that pre-workout stuff in the in the jockel white tea
[02:22:45] how much of a violation is that on a skill from one to ten i don't think it's a violation but
[02:22:49] i would just use discipline you can put discipline in jockel white tea but that's just another
[02:22:54] micro dose of caffeine though i don't want caffeine but i would record right oi tea that's the thing
[02:22:59] sure there's tastes got jammed up there's 60 milligrams of caffeine in jockel white tea can't
[02:23:04] that's that's enough let's say hypothetically again hypothetically one was looking for more than
[02:23:09] 60 milligrams get get Greek fire okay so you know Greek fire us yeah or Greek fire from origin
[02:23:21] which has caffeine in it it's like a it's like a fat burner right so if you get that that's just
[02:23:28] caffeine in it and it'll get you it'll get you what you need all right so the violation level four
[02:23:34] yes sure i i drink a lot of coffee and a lot of caffeine and yeah that's jockel white tea's got
[02:23:40] plenty of caffeine for me it's a legit i'll tell you what i like about it with a cans of it would
[02:23:44] take care well it's been crazy hot and Texas summer yeah and just just pull it with freezing cold
[02:23:50] one out of the if i'm out of the jockel my truck that's you know 125 degrees from sitting out of the
[02:23:55] sun and crack up in a super cold roll around the road it's pretty legit you're still alive my
[02:24:01] low i got to make it you know i got to make is i got to make something that like this that you
[02:24:05] can drink before you go to bed at night oh yeah just because because i can't i mean i want
[02:24:09] some of them since seven or eight o'clock at night and i think i'm gonna crack one open but then
[02:24:14] i think now then i'll be all fired up all night yeah yeah what like you put some sort of um
[02:24:21] because there's like you know tea what he called the tea that you brew before bed makes you smell
[02:24:26] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah kind of that yeah yeah kind of a male tea oh wow you know what we got
[02:24:31] situation here let me comment in strong for the tea you made your you made your bread no
[02:24:37] tell me you don't know all about tea i didn't know about what is it camera meal
[02:24:41] yeah look at you yeah so you could take that apology right you could you could call it
[02:24:47] so we could on jockel can a meal tea oh you know you could call it that if you want yeah
[02:24:51] i would probably just call it like well i'll figure something out but i will do that
[02:24:55] because I do need something at night, warm, hot in the summertime,
[02:24:59] or hot in the wintertime, but you could drink a cold that's tasty.
[02:25:02] Because that's the thing about the, the jokalway tea is the taste is good.
[02:25:06] Like we had this, I thought we were going with this,
[02:25:08] if you had a can of jokalway tea and a can of the most sweet,
[02:25:14] like, like, doctored up thing that's supposed to taste delicious,
[02:25:19] which would you pick?
[02:25:19] I picked jokalway tea all day long because the taste is, you know,
[02:25:23] when you, you know when you realize that gatorade,
[02:25:26] no offense against gatorade, no, a little bit of offense-gure.
[02:25:28] You know when you realize that gatorade doesn't actually
[02:25:31] quench your thirst, like when you're, I don't know,
[02:25:35] I think I was 20, right?
[02:25:38] And I was real thirsty and I drank a gatorade,
[02:25:40] and I was like, why am I still thirsty?
[02:25:41] Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:42] That because there's syrup in there or whatever,
[02:25:44] doesn't work good.
[02:25:46] Jokalway tea, you get that quench.
[02:25:47] Not like it, that's a quench, go on.
[02:25:49] Well, this for back to the, or the pre workout mix
[02:25:53] in the tea scenario, this person that we're talking about
[02:25:57] didn't finish it because it did jump up the whole tea scenario.
[02:26:01] Okay.
[02:26:02] It was like a theory.
[02:26:03] Very cool.
[02:26:03] Check.
[02:26:05] There it is, boom.
[02:26:07] Jokalway tea, outstanding.
[02:26:09] Hey, books, we got way of the warrior kid books,
[02:26:12] way of the warrior kid, and Mark's mission.
[02:26:15] Those are good books for kids to read.
[02:26:18] Just talking to a teacher out in the gym,
[02:26:21] teaching the book, eighth grade, if you're wondering
[02:26:23] about how old is an eighth grader?
[02:26:26] 11, 12, 11, 12.
[02:26:28] Yes.
[02:26:29] So 11, 12 year old, definitely in the same team.
[02:26:31] Sometimes when I meet someone and their kid is eight
[02:26:34] or 10, I just think your kids in the zone.
[02:26:37] And they did get so way the warrior kid and Mark's mission.
[02:26:40] I just started reading the way the warrior kid to my son.
[02:26:43] Does he get a history, right?
[02:26:45] Is he getting it?
[02:26:46] We got about 30 pages into it.
[02:26:48] He was so fired up.
[02:26:49] And he wanted to go out and disobey all of a sudden.
[02:26:52] It's funny.
[02:26:53] They get certain parts.
[02:26:54] Right.
[02:26:55] The grander kind of messages may not compute quite yet,
[02:26:59] but they'll get certain parts.
[02:27:00] So they'll like when this part comes.
[02:27:02] Yeah.
[02:27:03] It's keep doing it.
[02:27:04] Stoke to the feedback on that one.
[02:27:05] Also, just funnacles freedom field manual.
[02:27:08] It's a manual about how to get after it.
[02:27:11] And the audio version is not unautable.
[02:27:13] It's on iTunes, Amazon, music, Google play,
[02:27:15] and other MP3 platforms.
[02:27:17] So you can make it a specifically.
[02:27:19] We did that.
[02:27:20] Yeah.
[02:27:20] Maybe took a little financial hit.
[02:27:22] Whatever, want people to be able to use it as an alarm clock
[02:27:26] in their phone or a ringtone.
[02:27:28] So that's what you can do there.
[02:27:30] Those are a few books.
[02:27:34] Then we got the McGutt Extreme Ownership, obviously,
[02:27:37] which Jack went out for three years now.
[02:27:40] We have a new addition out.
[02:27:42] And of course, that caught me a leadership,
[02:27:44] which we were just talking about.
[02:27:46] And that's for it's available now for pre-order.
[02:27:49] It'll be released September 25th.
[02:27:51] Super excited about that.
[02:27:52] Looking forward to all your readers out there
[02:27:55] providing some feedback on that.
[02:27:57] And I hope this is at least as useful to you
[02:28:01] in your life's professional and personal lives
[02:28:03] as Extreme Ownership.
[02:28:04] So go get some dichotomy leadership, find the balance.
[02:28:08] You also, Dave, talk to me about the difference
[02:28:13] between first edition and let's say fifth edition of a book,
[02:28:18] which would you rather have?
[02:28:21] Which would I rather have?
[02:28:24] Yeah.
[02:28:25] I'd have to go with the first edition.
[02:28:27] That's right.
[02:28:28] That's sort of a standard.
[02:28:29] Yeah, it's the standard.
[02:28:30] Is there anyone running around going, man?
[02:28:31] I wish I had the night to this.
[02:28:32] Yeah, can't wait for that fourth edition.
[02:28:36] That is pretty cool with Extreme Ownership,
[02:28:37] with people still come up to us and have,
[02:28:41] with the, and the original paper,
[02:28:44] this was printed on was not very good for Extreme Ownership.
[02:28:47] It doesn't have the,
[02:28:49] and it doesn't have the number one New York Times best set
[02:28:51] across the top.
[02:28:52] So every once we still see some of those,
[02:28:54] you know, like, wow, that's a,
[02:28:55] that was a first printing run.
[02:28:57] I just, it's pretty cool.
[02:28:58] I just did that the other day.
[02:28:59] So a girl came up and I was signing her first edition.
[02:29:03] And there's four editions that you could possibly have.
[02:29:06] There's more than that.
[02:29:07] But the first one that came out is white,
[02:29:09] and there's no stick around.
[02:29:11] As soon as that made New York Times best set,
[02:29:13] they went and got stickers.
[02:29:14] It says number one New York Times best set,
[02:29:15] and they put them everywhere,
[02:29:16] because it's an advertising gig, right?
[02:29:18] But there's, so the people that got the first 10,000 copies,
[02:29:22] it's just a plain first dish.
[02:29:25] So I know there's people.
[02:29:28] And then you got, then they got the stickers on it.
[02:29:30] So you're still early.
[02:29:31] Then you got the one that actually has printed
[02:29:33] on the cover, number one New York Times best set,
[02:29:36] and then finally we get to the fourth,
[02:29:39] the fourth version, which is the black cover,
[02:29:43] back in black, which is,
[02:29:44] we have to say that one's pretty cool.
[02:29:46] It's cool.
[02:29:47] It's a different color.
[02:29:47] It's a different avenue.
[02:29:49] It's coolness.
[02:29:50] Yeah, it's a different avenue of coolness.
[02:29:51] But still the first edition,
[02:29:53] we always like the first edition.
[02:29:54] And if you, so my point is, if you want the first edition,
[02:29:58] you got to order it pre.
[02:30:01] Otherwise you're going to get some other,
[02:30:03] you'll get one that says something else on it,
[02:30:04] be all different and we'll know.
[02:30:07] What do you mean?
[02:30:07] I'll just, I'll just be,
[02:30:09] I'll show you what we just signed up.
[02:30:10] Yeah.
[02:30:11] That's cool.
[02:30:11] I'm glad you got in the game, eventually.
[02:30:13] Ha ha.
[02:30:15] Oh, no, I'm gonna appreciate it.
[02:30:18] That's the long front.
[02:30:21] If you're interested in coming and bringing us in,
[02:30:23] talk to your leadership team,
[02:30:25] your frontline troops, your mid-level managers,
[02:30:27] whatever it may be, that's what we do with that
[02:30:29] long front is we solve problems through leadership.
[02:30:32] Everything that we wrote about,
[02:30:33] extreme ownership, all the things that we just talked about
[02:30:35] from dichotomy leadership,
[02:30:37] is what we do.
[02:30:38] It's me and Jaco.
[02:30:39] We launched this company going on seven years now,
[02:30:43] and we worked with a lot of company sense.
[02:30:44] And now, in addition, we've got,
[02:30:47] to me and Jaco, we got JP to now,
[02:30:49] we got Dave Burke, we got Flynn Cochran,
[02:30:51] we got Mike Surelli,
[02:30:53] and we just picked up a new member of our team,
[02:30:55] Maine Gun, Mike Bahama,
[02:30:57] a company commander with us in the body outstanding,
[02:31:00] outstanding guy, awesome team of folks.
[02:31:02] And so you're interested in what we do
[02:31:05] at the International Off-Rot, go hit us up at echelonfront.com.
[02:31:08] Also, we got the Muster, which is two days leadership,
[02:31:15] conference seminar gathering,
[02:31:18] that's what I'm talking about.
[02:31:18] It's a leadership master, that's what it is.
[02:31:21] October 17th, 18th, up in San Francisco,
[02:31:24] all the other ones have sold out,
[02:31:26] this is the sixth monster,
[02:31:27] they've also sold out, this one's gonna sell out,
[02:31:29] even earlier actually.
[02:31:30] I think so.
[02:31:31] We're way ahead of schedule,
[02:31:33] you wanna come to it extremownership.com,
[02:31:35] you can come to the Muster.
[02:31:38] And then also for our military law enforcement,
[02:31:42] firefighters, Border Patrol,
[02:31:44] Paramedics, first responders, anybody in uniform,
[02:31:48] we're launching our first ever first responder, military,
[02:31:52] uniform wearing focused leadership gathering.
[02:31:56] And this is, we're calling the roll call, roll call,
[02:31:58] here's their one, first ever is gonna happen,
[02:32:01] September 21st in Dallas.
[02:32:04] And this thing is, it was by request,
[02:32:06] we worked with so many different first responders,
[02:32:10] and fire departments and law enforcement groups
[02:32:14] and police departments, federal, state, local.
[02:32:17] We were worked with all levels of these groups.
[02:32:22] And we've had so many folks say,
[02:32:23] hey, can we have a focus leadership conference just for us?
[02:32:28] And that's what this is.
[02:32:29] So we've got several hundred people already signed up for this thing.
[02:32:33] This is for you guys.
[02:32:34] This is for all you, all you,
[02:32:35] all you, you, lissor, that are interesting this.
[02:32:36] We try to make it at a price point.
[02:32:38] That was much more affordable than the Muster,
[02:32:40] so that we could, we could have as many folks attend
[02:32:43] as could come.
[02:32:45] And we hope you come from far,
[02:32:46] might be there gonna be talking about the importance
[02:32:48] of training, the importance of dealing with what you deal
[02:32:51] with every day and driving those standards
[02:32:53] and pushing your team and leading up the chain,
[02:32:58] as well as all those kind of specific law enforcement,
[02:33:03] firefighter, first responder, military focused issues,
[02:33:07] that we can really dive into.
[02:33:08] We don't have to talk about the business leader stuff
[02:33:10] because this is for you guys, that's what it's for.
[02:33:12] So if you're interested in that,
[02:33:13] if you're on the fence, if you're thinking about it,
[02:33:15] come join us for a roll call at Dallas September 21st.
[02:33:21] And of course, you've heard on this podcast,
[02:33:24] we launched a new company, a subsidiary company,
[02:33:28] to Esslon Front, it's called Esslon Front Overwatch,
[02:33:31] our EF Overwatch.
[02:33:33] And you can check that out at EFOverWatch.com.
[02:33:38] It's a great company designed to,
[02:33:42] one of the biggest things that we see
[02:33:44] from the companies who work with is people ask us,
[02:33:46] where can we get people like you?
[02:33:48] Where can we get folks from a mindset of extreme ownership?
[02:33:51] And so we started that in the Special Operations world
[02:33:54] and the goal of Overwatch is to take special operations,
[02:33:59] veterans and combat aviator veterans
[02:34:01] and place them in companies with,
[02:34:06] place them in companies who are looking for people
[02:34:09] with that mindset.
[02:34:10] And EFOverWatch is,
[02:34:13] is some I'm super excited about,
[02:34:14] we have a massive demand signal right now,
[02:34:16] frankly, we have a lot more clients
[02:34:18] that are reaching out these companies
[02:34:19] that are seeking folks to place and offer them job opportunities.
[02:34:24] And we have a lot more clients
[02:34:26] than we have on the candidate side.
[02:34:27] So if you're a Special Operator
[02:34:30] and you're about to be retired
[02:34:32] or leaving just leaving the military
[02:34:35] or I've left even a few years ago
[02:34:37] or on the combat aviation side,
[02:34:39] go to eFOverWatch.com, fill out the application there
[02:34:43] and start the paperwork
[02:34:45] because we got, there's an awesome opportunity
[02:34:48] here for some great companies
[02:34:50] with some great leadership positions
[02:34:53] and some promising promotion opportunities
[02:34:55] and some companies that exhibit extreme ownership
[02:34:58] that have that as part of their culture.
[02:34:59] So don't miss out on those opportunities,

[02:36:14] The people that make this podcast possible.
[02:36:17] And it's not some long list of sponsors
[02:36:20] that people that make this podcast possible
[02:36:22] is our military or police law enforcement,
[02:36:26] firefighters, border patrol,
[02:36:27] paramedics, other first responders.
[02:36:29] Without you protecting us from evil abroad
[02:36:33] and keeping us safe here at home,
[02:36:35] we wouldn't be able to do what we do.
[02:36:38] So thank you for doing what you do
[02:36:43] and to everyone else out there
[02:36:46] whether you are making something
[02:36:49] or baking something,
[02:36:50] whether you're serving food or serving warrants,
[02:36:54] whether you work in a bank
[02:36:56] or you build banks.
[02:36:58] If you wear a suit and tie
[02:37:00] or you wear coveralls and a hard hat
[02:37:03] no matter who you are and what you do
[02:37:06] do it to the best of your ability.
[02:37:09] Take pride in your work and be the best you can
[02:37:13] but at the same time,
[02:37:16] stay balanced.
[02:37:18] Be aggressive but not reckless.
[02:37:21] Take ownership but empower your team.
[02:37:24] Be humble but not passive.
[02:37:28] Be disciplined.
[02:37:30] But be free.
[02:37:32] Balance that I caught a meter ship
[02:37:34] and the dichotomies of life
[02:37:37] and as you do that,
[02:37:40] keep getting after it.
[02:37:43] And until next time,
[02:37:45] this is life and echo and jockel.
[02:37:48] Out.
