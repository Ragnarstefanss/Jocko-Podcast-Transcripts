Yeah, I feel like this applies to more people, especially when you're in a sort of playing it to other than something other than military stuff, where because it's so feels like in any way that's so often we find ourselves in a situation where it's like, I don't have the experience, I don't have the resources, I don't have the, you know, I'm not as big as that guy or whatever, and we feel like we kind of don't have a chance, you know, because they're just so far ahead of us in that way. You're giving away what you're doing to achieve victory and part of that goes deep because even even if you're not like, because no, you know, like, okay, if you want the enemy to know, right, that's like some like, hey, this may get into you. I think it's underrated to because the even just as a human being it feels like you want the attention, you want the credit, you want the recognition for this, you want to win the award, you want them and know you won or, you know, even more scary or counterproductive is you want the enemy to know that you just did this. And then, you know, the classic, you know, guys or whatever they're like holding on to it saying like, no, it is important and all the stuff is like, no, it's not because I know exactly you're talking about still. Yeah, puts it in the or is like, she puts it in her GPS and her phone and starts rattling off the directions as if I don't know, you know, this man, man of the world doesn't know, um, you know, how to get to the place we're going to downtown my hood, whatever. I think it's this is the technique in sales where you ask them like questions with only one answer, you know, like, or it's basically this like if you they say, why kind of eat this cup cake or whatever. But like it is cool because every time like because a wallet, you don't just automatically think, or I don't anyway, but when you will help us it out, you can tell like, you know, you took some pride in that one. We're looking to be creative, like, it's quick, you know, quick, unlike, you know, let's face it, the bigger a, I don't know, I'm thinking of a company, by the way. Anytime you and Darrell Cooper start talking about genocides and all the, you know, the brutal, we're selling it on deep of history and you know, whatever it's like YouTube's like, oh, you pump your brakes there. They're going to be outsourcing the reading scripts, like all this stuff, because they kind of got in a, in a big way where it's like, hey, we need everyone to give the same quote unquote quality customer service. It's like often, often or, you know, tens not to or something like this, you know, got to be careful with always never. So it's like, oh, no one has a chance, you know, they're like, I'm an apoli and whatever way, you know. It didn't, it never got, you know, deep into history in high school and all this stuff or whatever, but kind of the thing of this is going to be known news to you, obviously, but when you do presented in such an interesting way or whatever, it one of the many valuable things you can get from it is like, It's like a challenge almost kind of thing, but even if like just everyday stuff, you know, some people, for example, they'll make they'll start making a lot of money or something Just like just like surfing, just like skateboarding, just like playing basketball. And then, you know, how one exception kind of can kind of open the flood gates for others, you know, and you're like, oh, wait, we're seeing this exception kind of often, oh, shoot, we should maybe re-valuate or update that always. You know, you know, like, I like less, less frosting. Pete Roberts like, you know, if you don't, if you don't knock it out of the park with Pete, he, you know, he's like whatever. Like, we need, you know, you got to know all this stuff about our big, longstanding company. You know, you're not going to be, hey, our, you know, our construction company is going to do better at night. The document is called Proverbs of the Light Infantry, which out of the gate, you know, I'm kind of already thinking, this is going to be good to go. It's more like, I don't know, maybe the first thing that comes to mind maybe for a normal person would be, I don't know, authority years. Where it's like, it's like, I forget the exact words, but it said, like, if you get sick, that's kind of your phone. Like on the surface, the kids got to listen to you, you know, but no, like you're the one who you're essentially working for them. Just to like show how it's like a need, I guess, you know, for recognition or whatever. That's one of those things where it could be where you know how like there was a reason back in the day where the reason was like significant. Oh, I like the brownie that's a little bit like the hardened part, you know, around. I'll tell you what, when you run, when, like, you see, kids wrestling and one kid runs, like they go out of bounds, one kid runs back, runs back, meet, you know, toll on the line, ready. You know, if, if we know that eating cupcakes, sugar, butter, frosting, brownies, sugar cubes, if we know that that's bad for us makes us less healthy. So you know how, I don't know my son when he texts, there's you know how, well, I have an iPhone and it has an auto correct, right?
