[00:00:00] This is jockel podcast number 301 with echo Charles and me jockel wink good evening echo good evening
[00:00:10] How did I end up here?
[00:00:13] I'm smart
[00:00:15] I'm funny. I look pretty damn handsome if I do say so myself
[00:00:21] But here I am
[00:00:24] nowhere
[00:00:26] And it seems this is where I will always be
[00:00:32] nowhere
[00:00:35] Bedroom
[00:00:37] It is not an apartment, but it looks like one
[00:00:40] cheap furniture will used carpet not clean but not dirty
[00:00:46] The bedroom is not unique in its wares bed desk chair dresser
[00:00:52] Small bedside table with lamp over headlight
[00:00:57] Janky ceiling fan spinning at a low speed
[00:01:01] Then there is the day core
[00:01:04] Pictures hung neatly on the walls
[00:01:08] They are strange
[00:01:10] Or at least indicate a strangeness that is hard to interpret
[00:01:15] harmless but different
[00:01:17] Johnny walks in
[00:01:22] 20 something leaning towards 20
[00:01:26] Pretty damn handsome from unkempt young man who stays up to late and eats the wrong foods and drinks more beer and whiskey than he should
[00:01:36] He looks at his brother
[00:01:39] Johnny is frustrated
[00:01:41] He tries to remain restrained but it can be hard after all these years
[00:01:48] What the hell cleaner man? I told you about these shirts
[00:01:52] Arty looks distraught
[00:01:55] Johnny sees
[00:01:57] Johnny cannot stay frustrated
[00:02:01] After all
[00:02:02] This is Arty his brother
[00:02:06] And no one could really be mad at Arty
[00:02:08] What?
[00:02:10] Is it not clean? Arty replies
[00:02:12] Honestly concerned
[00:02:14] Wondering if he had somehow failed his brother
[00:02:17] No Arty
[00:02:18] It isn't that it is not clean
[00:02:20] It's clean
[00:02:22] But it's just a t-shirt
[00:02:24] I know
[00:02:26] Arty cuts in
[00:02:28] It's 100% cotton t-shirt
[00:02:30] I used a warm warm cycle
[00:02:32] It shouldn't have shrunk at all
[00:02:34] I'm always careful about that
[00:02:36] The wrong Arty that's not it
[00:02:38] It's just
[00:02:40] Never mind
[00:02:42] Forget it
[00:02:44] What's wrong
[00:02:46] This was killing Arty
[00:02:48] The one thing he was supposed to be good at
[00:02:50] And it seemed like he messed it up
[00:02:54] Arty
[00:02:55] Johnny replied
[00:02:56] As kindly as he could
[00:02:58] It's just that it's a t-shirt
[00:03:00] You don't press t-shirts
[00:03:02] You don't put starch in t-shirts
[00:03:04] Buddy
[00:03:04] But the creases are sharp
[00:03:06] Aren't they?
[00:03:08] Arty replies
[00:03:08] Wondering what on earth
[00:03:10] The problem could be
[00:03:12] The creases are sharp
[00:03:14] Johnny concedes
[00:03:16] But that's not the point
[00:03:18] You don't put military creases in t-shirts
[00:03:20] I've told you this before
[00:03:22] Arty
[00:03:22] But why?
[00:03:24] Cotton holds the starch really
[00:03:26] Well
[00:03:28] Johnny starts to get frustrated again
[00:03:30] He's been down this road before
[00:03:32] Many times
[00:03:34] Look cleaner
[00:03:36] I know that you always tell me that
[00:03:38] And I always tell you
[00:03:40] You just don't start your press t-shirts
[00:03:42] Because
[00:03:44] You just don't do it
[00:03:46] Mom likes hers
[00:03:48] Pressed
[00:03:50] Johnny lets out a sigh
[00:03:52] Arty realizes he's gone too far
[00:03:54] Listen, Arty, I get it
[00:03:56] But I'm not mom
[00:03:58] And I don't want my t-shirts
[00:04:00] I'm not a star, it's a black Sabbath t-shirt
[00:04:02] I just wear it out with a pair of jeans
[00:04:04] Okay, can you just give me
[00:04:06] Give them a simple, wash and dry
[00:04:08] From now on, please
[00:04:10] Low heat tumble dry
[00:04:12] Arty asks
[00:04:13] Wanting to get a good procedure
[00:04:14] Lockdown
[00:04:16] Johnny smiles
[00:04:18] Yeah, Arty
[00:04:20] I think that would be perfect
[00:04:22] Thanks bud
[00:04:23] I can do it now
[00:04:24] Arty offers
[00:04:26] I gotta go
[00:04:28] Okay, it won't happen again Johnny
[00:04:30] Thanks Arty
[00:04:32] Johnny said with a smile
[00:04:34] And Johnny?
[00:04:36] Arty asks
[00:04:37] What?
[00:04:38] I'm sorry
[00:04:40] It's okay bud
[00:04:42] It's okay
[00:04:44] Johnny feels a little bad as Arty walks away
[00:04:46] They are brothers
[00:04:48] They even look a little like
[00:04:50] It isn't too much of a stretch to see the similar jeans
[00:04:54] Dark hair
[00:04:56] Blue eyes
[00:04:57] Pernounced eyebrows
[00:04:59] But that is where the similarities end
[00:05:03] After all, Arty is different
[00:05:07] A little pludgy
[00:05:11] Glasses
[00:05:13] It is possible to tell from looking at his face
[00:05:15] That something isn't quite right
[00:05:17] There are medical names that could be assigned
[00:05:21] But most of those wouldn't quite hit the mark
[00:05:25] He's older than Johnny by six years
[00:05:29] But his peculiarities keep him living at home
[00:05:33] Johnny on the other hand doesn't have an excuse to still be living at home
[00:05:38] Other than Arty and his mom
[00:05:41] They both need him around
[00:05:45] That's where he tells himself anyway
[00:05:47] Johnny's bedroom is the same room he has always had
[00:05:52] Matches on the floor, no box spring, no bed frame
[00:05:57] Postures of rock bands on the wall from when he was younger
[00:06:01] Black Sabbath, motor head
[00:06:04] Led Zeppelin, ACDC
[00:06:07] Some muscle cars too
[00:06:09] He hadn't bothered to take them down as he outgrew them
[00:06:14] He also hadn't bothered to clean his room very often
[00:06:18] Close remnants of food and beer cans on the floor
[00:06:23] This was all a stark contrast to Arty's room
[00:06:26] Critically clean with the bed tightly made
[00:06:31] And then there are the walls of Arty's room in their curious day core
[00:06:36] The walls neatly display pictures of clothes, washing machines and dryers
[00:06:42] There are brochures about various lines of laundry equipment on his little desk
[00:06:47] Some of the more colorful ones are also hanging on the wall
[00:06:51] There are also coupons for laundry detergents, fabric softens
[00:06:55] And stain removal products on the desk in an envelope
[00:07:00] The source of his nickname, Cleaner
[00:07:04] Is no mystery at all
[00:07:06] Arty likes to clean
[00:07:09] Laundry
[00:07:11] To be exact
[00:07:13] That right there is the opening
[00:07:20] To a new book
[00:07:23] A new book called Final Spin
[00:07:26] Which was written by me
[00:07:31] And it is a novel
[00:07:35] I guess that's what it says in the cover
[00:07:37] But it's also kind of a poem
[00:07:39] It's also kind of a manuscript I don't really know 100%
[00:07:44] What to call it but it's not normal in the way that it is written
[00:07:49] And so as far as the storyline goes
[00:07:55] It's, I was thinking about this
[00:07:58] I think it's a little bit of an alternate autobiography of source of your very alternate history books
[00:08:04] So it's where they take some event in the past and they change it
[00:08:08] What if the Nazis won?
[00:08:10] What if the south won the civil war?
[00:08:12] They call them alternate history books
[00:08:15] So it's kind of thinking this is almost like an alternate biography in a way
[00:08:19] Maybe not specifically but maybe some of my friends
[00:08:22] Some of the experiences we had
[00:08:24] Maybe my life if I'd taken some different turns along the way
[00:08:27] Well I didn't know this guy's name is Johnny
[00:08:30] The guy's name is Johnny
[00:08:32] Yeah but then there's like you're going to see as we talk through this
[00:08:35] I'm composite characters and it's almost like everyone's a composite character
[00:08:39] What do you mean composite?
[00:08:40] Meaning different people from my past kind of
[00:08:43] A symbol together
[00:08:45] Maybe two people that acted a certain way
[00:08:47] Well one characteristic from someone
[00:08:49] Maybe a little bit of a characteristic from me
[00:08:51] So that was kind of the starting point
[00:08:56] These kind of humans and you put them in this situation
[00:09:00] So what does the book about?
[00:09:02] Let me, I'm going to start off by reading a review of the book
[00:09:04] The first review to come out about the book
[00:09:06] And this review came from
[00:09:09] Something called Publishers Weekly
[00:09:12] Which is a publishing trade magazine that's been around since 1872
[00:09:17] And the subtitle of this thing is the international news magazine of book publishing in book selling
[00:09:23] This is the heavy hitter of this industry
[00:09:27] Since the 1940s the book review section
[00:09:30] Is sort of become the center of the magazine in the online website
[00:09:35] And it carries a lot of weight
[00:09:37] And truly ultimately determines a lot of what you read
[00:09:42] Depending on how it does and how this publication talks about it
[00:09:47] What's interesting is the reviews in publishers weekly are anonymous
[00:09:51] They're short
[00:09:53] They're blunt
[00:09:55] And oftentimes to the point of being brutal
[00:09:58] You can see that the people that write them
[00:10:00] Can be harsh and very usually crafty writers
[00:10:04] So they're harsh in a pretty savage way
[00:10:07] I was reading a little bit about it one author said
[00:10:09] A negative review is never pleasant
[00:10:12] But publishers weekly reviews have a particularly heart-stopping quality
[00:10:17] And this guy wrote a piece
[00:10:19] I didn't write down his name but it was how he got a bad review
[00:10:22] And just what it felt like
[00:10:24] Now as I said this book is different
[00:10:31] It's not a normal book
[00:10:33] It's hard to classify the form that I wrote it in
[00:10:36] And I've written a bunch of other books before
[00:10:39] Some best selling books in New York Times best selling books
[00:10:42] But here's the thing those books were of a different genre
[00:10:46] Right
[00:10:47] And that means a lot in this world
[00:10:50] In the publishing world and the literature world
[00:10:55] I've written a bunch of these non-fiction adult books
[00:10:59] That's what I've written
[00:11:00] And I've written children's fiction books
[00:11:02] Right but neither of those are fiction adult books
[00:11:06] So it's like saying I played professional football
[00:11:09] So I can play professional baseball too
[00:11:11] It's sort of like saying that
[00:11:13] Which we know
[00:11:14] Doesn't really work that way
[00:11:16] And most people can't handle that transition
[00:11:20] And don't handle that transition
[00:11:22] So going into this going into writing the novel
[00:11:25] Right I got warned
[00:11:27] I've ever talked about this?
[00:11:28] Probably
[00:11:29] I got warned by my publisher
[00:11:32] By my I got warned by my editor
[00:11:34] I got warned by my agent
[00:11:36] They were
[00:11:38] They were I think
[00:11:40] Little bit trying to talk me out of it
[00:11:42] Little bit trying to talk me out of it
[00:11:44] They're saying it's a different world
[00:11:46] And they don't care what you've done before
[00:11:48] And they might they might actually hold your other books against you
[00:11:51] They kind of say that kind of
[00:11:53] Right
[00:11:54] And you should just maybe stay in your lane
[00:11:56] Which by the way I got that about my kids books too
[00:11:59] But
[00:12:01] This story
[00:12:03] Is one of the stories that's in my head
[00:12:05] And I got a lot of stories in my head
[00:12:06] And this was the one that bubbled the surface that needed to get out
[00:12:09] So I got it out
[00:12:10] And this is what publishers weekly had to say
[00:12:12] So here we go
[00:12:14] From the critics
[00:12:16] Final spin a novel by Jaka Willing
[00:12:18] Former Navy SEAL and Children's Book author Willink
[00:12:21] Way of the Warrior Kids series
[00:12:23] Marks is adult fiction debut
[00:12:25] With the downbeat and gripping story of a group of characters
[00:12:29] Abandoned by the American Dream
[00:12:31] At age 23
[00:12:33] Johnny cares for his alcoholic mother
[00:12:35] And mentally challenged brother Arty
[00:12:37] While holding down a dead end job as a stockboy
[00:12:40] At a big box store
[00:12:43] Arty is obsessed with clean clothes
[00:12:46] And when the laundromat where he works is slated to be sold
[00:12:50] Johnny decides to buy the business in order to keep Arty employed
[00:12:55] To come up with the $40,000 he needs
[00:12:59] Johnny and his best friend go
[00:13:01] Decide to rob the safe at their store
[00:13:04] Hand off the money to the owner
[00:13:06] Then high tail at Tomexica
[00:13:08] They get the money
[00:13:10] But the getaway scheme is flawed from the start
[00:13:13] And Johnny and Goat quickly
[00:13:15] Have the state police on their trail
[00:13:18] To make matters worse
[00:13:19] Johnny is forced to say goodbye to his girlfriend Jessica
[00:13:23] Who has just found out she is pregnant
[00:13:26] Willing tells his story in quick blasts of high coup like writing
[00:13:31] And they give the example here
[00:13:33] Johnny on the customers at his workplace
[00:13:36] They call people
[00:13:38] Flesh covered robot beings in need of fuel and meaning
[00:13:42] They find both here and quote
[00:13:46] With dialogue reminiscent of early David Mehmet
[00:13:50] Told with a gritty simplicity
[00:13:53] This retains a hold on the reader right through to the inevitable tragic climax
[00:13:59] So that's the plot of the book
[00:14:04] And that's the impression that they got at publishers weekly
[00:14:08] Which was really an awesome review
[00:14:12] I was definitely very stoked to read that
[00:14:15] As was my literary age and as was my publisher as was my editor
[00:14:19] Everyone thinks you're all in the dice
[00:14:21] Everyone's nervous
[00:14:22] They're scared
[00:14:23] Yeah, you kind of are rolling the dice
[00:14:25] But the nature of dice is you win and you lose
[00:14:28] Yeah, you know a lot of times what people worried about is the losing part
[00:14:32] Yeah, but there is the winning part
[00:14:34] Yeah, now so they compare me they compare the
[00:14:36] The
[00:14:38] Writing or at least the dialogue to yeah the dialogue and I want to give myself too much credit here
[00:14:44] But they compare the dialogue to David Mehmet Mehmet
[00:14:48] Who is
[00:14:50] Well straight up he's a Pulitzer Prize winning freaking author
[00:14:54] He's a playwright he's a film director director screenwriter he's written all kinds of stuff
[00:15:00] You've heard a Glenn Gary Glenn Ross. Yes, sir. Yep. He wrote that. Yeah, coffees for clothes
[00:15:07] Always be closing speed the plow he wrote the screenplay for the postman
[00:15:12] Always ring twice
[00:15:14] Little Jack Nicholson
[00:15:16] The verdict the untouchable's hoffa wag the dog Hannibal
[00:15:20] He wrote and directed things changed homicide Olianna the wins low boy
[00:15:26] Staten main Spartan just a bunch of stuff what I'm saying is that this guy's a highly respected and a
[00:15:31] Completter definitely I was
[00:15:34] Very pleasantly surprised and humbled to be compared to him in any way, so we were off to a strong start
[00:15:39] We're feeling good about it so far. Much appreciated
[00:15:43] Because this is a different world
[00:15:46] So
[00:15:48] It's interesting
[00:15:50] appreciate yeah people if you if you want to get the book that will be awesome
[00:15:54] And it's not a complete dud. We'll say that
[00:16:00] So now this is an interesting we're gonna get into the book a little bit
[00:16:06] Which is gonna be a little bit tricky because I don't want our ruin the story story spoiler spoiler alert
[00:16:11] So I'm gonna keep it
[00:16:14] A little bit focused on not going too much into it, but at the same time getting into the characters a little bit so
[00:16:21] The characters
[00:16:24] Let's start with this guy, Arty
[00:16:26] So we got this guy Arty who
[00:16:29] You already heard about he's got some kind of mental challenges which I don't name in the book and the reason I didn't name him in the book is because
[00:16:38] A lot of times I've met people in my life where I know that they have some kind of mental challenge, but
[00:16:43] I don't know what it is. I'm not a doctor. There's no they're not wearing a label on their
[00:16:51] hat that says whatever mental challenge they've got
[00:16:56] And so I didn't want a label you know I didn't want to throw a label on there. This is the particular
[00:17:01] Situation that this person's in and the other thing is I you know people have such a wide variety of mental challenges that
[00:17:08] You don't know what you're gonna get
[00:17:10] So
[00:17:12] Where did this character came from? Well, this is a very direct story. I worked at Wendy's
[00:17:20] Yeah, I don't know if that I don't know if that weren't the hell yeah, but I worked at Wendy's
[00:17:25] And when I worked at Wendy's you've been Wendy's before right, which let's face it kind of props to Wendy's Wendy's
[00:17:33] Wendy's when he serves it up and I used to I used to get my child on at Wendy's when I was a teenager
[00:17:39] Well, at this Wendy's when I worked there was there was a salad bar you know they have a salad bar at Wendy's
[00:17:43] I don't know they still have salad bar Wendy's not that I know of oh, I don't know so back in the day
[00:17:49] Back in the day they had a salad bar at Wendy's and the person that ran the salad bar
[00:17:54] That took care of the salad bar that we supplied the
[00:17:57] Peach slices and the Caesar salad dressing was this woman who clearly had she was probably
[00:18:04] I'm gonna say 55 maybe 60 years old so older woman thin
[00:18:11] Short hair her name was a gene and
[00:18:15] She obviously had you know so it seemed like some kind of perhaps autism
[00:18:22] But again, I don't know. She's not wearing a label
[00:18:25] But she was super into the salad bar
[00:18:29] She was probably the best one of the best employees ever she loved this salad bar. She wanted to be squared away
[00:18:35] She was out there with a washcloth wiping up if anybody if you spilled a drop of salad dressing on your
[00:18:41] on your maneuver from the
[00:18:44] Spoon to the plate she was honest she was standing by with a rag
[00:18:48] She was gonna wipe that up like almost bumping into you, but she also knew that that wasn't correct
[00:18:52] She'd give you you know three quarters of a second to take one step towards the croutons and she was in there
[00:18:58] Getting on it
[00:19:01] So she's there and she's working and she loved it. I mean like she was obsessed with it and no one would talk to her
[00:19:07] Right everyone was kind of mean to her right because you could make fun of her and she was an easy target
[00:19:12] And I was cool to you know, I'd always say hi, hi, Jean
[00:19:15] I know you know trying to talk to her a little bit and every time I would start a conversation with her
[00:19:19] Hey, Jean how are you you know, hey, Jean how's it going today and she'd be like I just opened up a new can of of
[00:19:24] Of of Coutons in the bar new a new can of sliced peaches. They're gonna be so good
[00:19:29] I'd be awesome
[00:19:31] You know and I'd say oh, you know, it's here like lunch break
[00:19:35] Hey Jean are you gonna take a lunch break? Yeah, but first I'm gonna get more sliced onions out here and
[00:19:40] Have you seen the onions there so fresh she just fired up
[00:19:46] to the point where
[00:19:49] I was torn
[00:19:51] between
[00:19:52] thinking
[00:19:54] if it was
[00:19:56] Unabusive situation where she was being taken advantage of
[00:20:00] to where
[00:20:01] The others like complete opposite was she just
[00:20:05] What are they so well she's so lucky to be there and happy that they hired her and like here she was with this job
[00:20:13] So that was one part of it the other part of it that struck me that stuck with me for my whole life
[00:20:19] Is that she was
[00:20:24] Happy right so here I am this young freaking punk ass kid and I'm there with other
[00:20:30] Punk ass kids that are working at Wendy's and everyone's kind of miserable
[00:20:35] Right, did you ever work at a fast food joint? Do you ever work at a restaurant? I did not work at a restaurant
[00:20:40] The bar nightclub's closest but even being a bouncer in a bar nightclub is not
[00:20:45] That's let's face it that's like a little bit kind of cool. Yeah a little bit right you have a little
[00:20:51] Pows also a bar back it one point at other clubs and get tender so it's it's service
[00:20:57] It's different you're good. It's different it's a little bit cool
[00:21:01] Yes, to be a bouncer at a club. Yes, sir, right
[00:21:04] I mean that can be a definitely a cool job
[00:21:07] It's not cool to work at Wendy's
[00:21:10] Run in the grill running the salvage bar. You're not happy about it. There's no benefits
[00:21:17] Zero you know you other than you're getting paid money, which is kind of cool
[00:21:21] So what struck me what I was remembered is we're all kind of miserable even if this is what I also remember like the the general manager
[00:21:29] And I forget to remember his name
[00:21:31] But he was like work he was one of those guys. It was just a work working, you know working
[00:21:35] Just always pissed off about something like hey, what you know always mad so even the own I mean he was I don't
[00:21:41] He's the owner around the because the owner, but he's definitely the general manager
[00:21:45] He might have even been the franchise owner or something but he's using there all the time
[00:21:49] But you know he had to be making
[00:21:51] Legitum at money because when you when you're a general manager one of those you're making good money, but he was freaking miserable
[00:21:56] Something to myself everyone here is miss every single person here
[00:22:00] 100 I mean the how many employees that they probably have
[00:22:03] Probably a total of 35 to 40 employees, you know day shift night shift
[00:22:09] You know everyone
[00:22:11] Everyone's part time, you know, so no one's really working so there's like probably 40 employees there total
[00:22:18] And every single one of us was miserable and
[00:22:22] Hated life
[00:22:24] Except for Jean and she was smiling and she was into it and she was amped
[00:22:29] so
[00:22:30] I took that idea
[00:22:32] and
[00:22:34] The reason I ended up with laundry is because I worked at or the where place where I used to go to the laundry mat in San Diego
[00:22:43] Had this the people at own the laundry mat
[00:22:46] the the they were from Asia and
[00:22:49] The wife didn't speak English, but the husband would be kind of be there, but the the the wife didn't speak English
[00:22:55] But she'd come out and talk to me
[00:22:57] In I don't even know where she was from but she would talk to me and smile and laugh and make jokes
[00:23:05] Not in English, not in English, but they were funny
[00:23:09] I mean I
[00:23:10] They were so funny that I did laugh I would laugh. I would do my wife. I would laugh and whatnot even know what it was about
[00:23:15] You know she might point it like you know a pile of clothes and say something
[00:23:20] In whatever language you were so I could do it didn't just start laughing if my wife were just laugh
[00:23:24] It had to be pretty funny for her to get that but joy on it, right?
[00:23:29] So I don't know that I landed on laundry
[00:23:34] So there we go there we get already that kind of wraps up this guy already as a character where he came from so now we get this other character Johnny
[00:23:42] Which as you said, yeah, it's my guess my
[00:23:45] My real first name is John so do we get the Johnny from that kind of but I don't know I maybe just the generic of
[00:23:52] Of the name Johnny more than anything else, but but probably the strongest
[00:23:59] Influence on this character is a kid that I grew up with a kid named Jeff Lang who I've talked about on this on the spotcast before
[00:24:08] So Jeff Lang was like my best friend
[00:24:11] From maybe
[00:24:14] Third grade
[00:24:16] Maybe second no probably second second first or second grade
[00:24:19] until
[00:24:21] seventh grade and
[00:24:23] in fifth grade when we we were in the same classroom together all day
[00:24:29] Because that's before you start going to different classes, right?
[00:24:32] So fifth grade we were in the same class, you know sitting next to each other and we were we were
[00:24:37] Trouble makers right just always getting in trouble always causing problems always you know laughing when we shouldn't be laughing
[00:24:44] Just doing stuff that we shouldn't have been doing
[00:24:46] But he was always a little bit more
[00:24:50] He had a little bit he had a little bit less obedience in him. I didn't have much
[00:24:55] He had even less obedience in him so like at that point when the teacher would
[00:25:02] Threaten or you you'd be quieter you're going to the office
[00:25:06] That was he could I got checked by that
[00:25:09] Jeff wouldn't get checked by that he connects level gets sent to the office, right?
[00:25:13] So he had a little bit extra and he was super funny
[00:25:17] I mean hilarious, you know kind of an athletic stud
[00:25:21] Which what does that mean that means when you're in fifth grade you kind of kick acid dodge ball right click kick ball and he's really good in run
[00:25:27] So yeah, just fast and all that stuff just a good at really good athlete better than me
[00:25:33] funnier than me
[00:25:35] Tall you know just just a good
[00:25:37] He was just kind of like a little bit better than me and everything and he also had a little bit of extra rebelliousness
[00:25:46] So
[00:25:48] As we got older
[00:25:51] I started kind of we we started started to deviate in our lives together
[00:25:57] You know we were we were still always friends but he started like
[00:26:01] Drinking started doing drugs started listening to I guess he went down like the kind of
[00:26:09] hippie music drugs that kind of thing and I was going into the hardcore music and more like the straight edge thing and so our paths really kind of deviate it
[00:26:20] But we were still friends because we were such good friends for so long that it doesn't matter what he's doing and what I'm doing
[00:26:26] We're still friends we just have this you know huge common connection and as we got so so as we got older
[00:26:34] He went really you know, I don't even know if he I don't even remember if he graduated high school
[00:26:41] Because he went hard you know doing drugs and drinking and just doing that whole thing
[00:26:48] And not not a bad person that's just what he was doing and still I'd see him see him in town
[00:26:53] We you know we'd always connect we'd always just had that friendship and I remember I joined the military during the Navy
[00:27:02] And you know small town and he kind of knew
[00:27:05] He'd heard what was going on and then I saw
[00:27:09] And I remember he said something to me
[00:27:12] Because you know when we were little kids we would play army all the time right when you're look when you're
[00:27:17] Seven years old ten years old 12 years old and you live in the woods you're playing army
[00:27:22] Right you're putting your burn in a cork and putting make your face black and put in camo on and
[00:27:28] Shoot and be guns at each other. That's what we did. We put you be be guns at each other and
[00:27:32] Every time you got hit you had to take a layer of clothing off
[00:27:37] And I remember the red rider it makes a little boom when it it's like
[00:27:43] This it's spring active. Oh yeah, and because you know we try and put limits on the number of pumps
[00:27:48] You could put on the pump backs right and but I remember the red rider because you you could hear it boom
[00:27:53] And then you hit you
[00:27:57] So so you know he was into the same kind of stuff. I was and then as we got older we deviated
[00:28:04] So I see him the last time I see him before I leave for the Navy
[00:28:10] he's
[00:28:12] You know clearly
[00:28:13] Not on a great path
[00:28:15] And he said something to me along the lines of
[00:28:22] He said yeah, you're doing the Navy I said yeah
[00:28:25] And I'm even remember if we if he knew what a seal was I think he kind of did
[00:28:31] The only I kind of did it that time you know new too much about it
[00:28:35] But he's I'm gonna reset something like hey, I wish I could go with you and I was like you can't bro, let's go
[00:28:41] And I could see like maybe that could
[00:28:43] And he said I can't he's I can't I can't
[00:28:48] Something like I can't anymore like he had knew he was kind of too far gone
[00:28:53] To correct the path that he was on
[00:28:56] So I end up going the Navy and I was going through seal training and I was
[00:29:03] Probably around
[00:29:05] Just before hell week maybe just after a week I forget but I called my parents to check in I talked to my mom
[00:29:12] And I found out that Jeff had killed himself and he had he had broken up with his girlfriend at the time and he'd killed himself
[00:29:22] And that was you know just just a
[00:29:27] Very sad
[00:29:29] Because well, I think what made it the most sad to me was that he had gone down this path
[00:29:37] And he had way more potential than I had as a human and and
[00:29:41] It was all gone
[00:29:43] And that was really sad and then when when I looked him up, you know, this is when the last time I recorded
[00:29:49] I talked about him on this podcast for a couple of years ago
[00:29:51] I had googled him just googled his name which you can google people from you know
[00:29:57] 1745 and there's some
[00:30:00] record and there's some
[00:30:02] Genealogy report about who they were and you google someone from 1942 and there's you know an obituary about who they were and I googled his name and
[00:30:13] There was like nothing
[00:30:16] nothing
[00:30:20] Which is just
[00:30:22] Carb because he was freaking hilarious smart
[00:30:26] on a just an awesome guy
[00:30:28] And and quite I didn't mention this but the book you know the dedication of the book is just says for Jeff Lang
[00:30:39] So that was sort of
[00:30:43] A lot of where this character Johnny came from somebody with kind of potential and
[00:30:51] Just
[00:30:53] Stuck made bad choices
[00:30:58] Maybe not bad choices but different choices maybe had some bad luck thrown in there
[00:31:03] Live this life
[00:31:06] So that's Johnny you hear about these too
[00:31:12] Next up you get a guy named goat who's Johnny's best friend. I'm gonna I'm gonna go to
[00:31:17] page 7 here in the book
[00:31:27] Nice shirt man goat says with a smile as he sees Johnny's starched black Sabbath T-shirt
[00:31:33] It's military creases running from each shoulder down to the waist up yours Johnny replies
[00:31:38] That cotton really holds the crease doesn't it yeah does Johnny says you couldn't iron them out or anything
[00:31:45] I tried but damn he uses an industrial press and he looks at me like I'm ripping his heart out what can I say
[00:31:51] My brother is crazy
[00:31:53] Yeah, but that son of a bitch can iron some shirts can he he sure is hell can you want another one
[00:32:00] What time do we have to be at work go to ask
[00:32:03] Not until 10 30 shit. Let's do this two more Lucy Johnny says to the bar made
[00:32:10] BB's bar
[00:32:12] Dingy working class watering hole cheap final seats even cheaper drinks
[00:32:19] Go is about the same age as Johnny though he looks a little younger
[00:32:24] His dark skin has an almost childlike texture his black hair looks as if it is always organized
[00:32:31] Regardless of what he has been doing
[00:32:34] His eyes are dark and deep
[00:32:36] He is handsome
[00:32:38] He too has that look about him that says he shouldn't be here
[00:32:43] Shouldn't be in a dead end job
[00:32:45] shouldn't be in a dead end bar
[00:32:48] shouldn't be in a dead end life
[00:32:51] But he is
[00:32:58] So there's go
[00:33:00] Full name George Martinez
[00:33:03] That is Johnny's best friend and again
[00:33:06] This guy is kind of a composite character of
[00:33:11] Friends that I had grown up the story takes place in southern California
[00:33:19] So he's a Mexican kid. I grew up with a bunch of white people primarily
[00:33:24] But when you're out in California you see the there's really no distinction between you know different people
[00:33:31] um
[00:33:35] And that's just another kid another kid that has a bunch of potential another kid that's talented another kid that's smart another kid that's handsome
[00:33:45] And another kid that's kind of stuck in a dead end sense scenario with what I said dead end job dead and bar dead in life right
[00:33:53] That's where we end up
[00:33:56] That's where we're at
[00:33:58] And
[00:34:00] And
[00:34:01] Well, we were talking before the podcast about the young
[00:34:06] I think I think carry was saying you remember what it was like when you were younger and it was just all in kind of like you're just on board
[00:34:13] Right down for the call it's right down for the cause and that was
[00:34:20] The characteristic that I kind of tried to throw in here with goat was that characteristic of being down for the cause and what's cool
[00:34:27] What when you when you talked about Johnny being based on me
[00:34:32] There's parts definitely elements of me in Johnny for sure, but one of the elements that's that's from me in goat is just down for the cause
[00:34:40] I've been to stuff that you do in your
[00:34:42] 16 17 18 and then when I got in the Navy your 19 20 years old guess what oh that's what as you like to say echo
[00:34:50] That's what we're doing
[00:34:51] Yep down for the cause. We're down
[00:34:53] We're ready to go well with that is that what we're doing hey all right once you kind of flip that switch
[00:35:01] That's why man the young the young men in the world
[00:35:05] They'll do some crazy shit
[00:35:07] Sometimes because they're just reddit rock and roll
[00:35:11] Ready to rock and roll so there's you two main characters and again
[00:35:16] One of the things one of the immediate feedback points
[00:35:19] When I submitted the manuscript
[00:35:21] And
[00:35:23] Was how about some more character development
[00:35:25] Right and what I said is you already know these characters
[00:35:29] We already know these characters. We grew up with these characters everybody knows these people
[00:35:33] Everybody knows these people we all know them
[00:35:36] We are them in many ways
[00:35:39] So I was like what what what what what also I need to tell you
[00:35:42] What else do I need to tell you you know these people I know these people
[00:35:46] There's your character development look around
[00:35:49] You
[00:35:51] You
[00:35:51] Started this with Arty
[00:35:53] Mm-hmm, and that's one of the first things that jumped out of me
[00:35:56] Or it's like not only do I know who that guy is I've known a guy or girl like that since I was a little kid
[00:36:03] And it's just he's just there. He's down for his cause some negative some positive some or like
[00:36:09] Angry at everyone somewhere. It's just happy to see every you know like but but really in it not it kind of in a generic
[00:36:15] Almost kind of way. I mean it's more particular because because of the book and everything right but you know that guy
[00:36:20] Totally know that guy that's the first thing that you're telling me for Arty already. Oh, yeah, and how many Arty's have you known about?
[00:36:27] 12
[00:36:28] Yeah, but they fit that in one way or another little different flavor
[00:36:32] Yeah, yeah, sure, you know, oh man. I could go deep into it too where some people would tease them just like your girl Jean same exact thing
[00:36:40] And they're everywhere so it's like yeah, you know we all know Arty
[00:36:44] I think we all know Arty we all know Jean we all know Johnny well know goat
[00:36:50] These are our people and there's the character development yeah, and look obviously there's more character
[00:36:56] Velpon that's goes on but you know
[00:36:59] For me to take the time to explain this this is one thing you're you're gonna notice when you read this book is
[00:37:04] I'm not I'm trying not to waste any time. Yeah. I'm trying not to waste any words
[00:37:08] It I'm trying to get you there it get you there get you into this as quick as possible and allow you to
[00:37:18] To utilize what you already know as a person yeah to to put the context around what's happening
[00:37:25] Use the schema. I was reading this book and they went deep in the word schema. Yeah
[00:37:30] That's like you stuff that you already know to describe something new right interesting and you use like
[00:37:39] You do this in real life too where you use less words than necessary kind of thing and it's weird because it makes you kind of go like
[00:37:46] Deep in your own head almost when you're like even that one when you're describing you know
[00:37:52] People you know me however be described in the news just like it's like
[00:37:56] You didn't do this like the opposite of the the opposite of that is like some grandiose thing where it's like
[00:38:02] You know one after another the people piled in like this and like that and then this person and it's
[00:38:08] But note you did the exact opposite but meanwhile you get the same effect but it's more like in your own
[00:38:13] And like real personal kind of you know there's something I talk about with leadership. It's
[00:38:19] Minimum force required right I as a leader want to use the minimum force
[00:38:24] To get you to do what I want you to do yeah to get you to do what we need to do right minimum force required
[00:38:31] I don't want to say hack or here's what you need to do I might say hack or what you think about doing this and you're like
[00:38:36] Oh, yeah, that's probably be good right I want to use the minimum force
[00:38:41] I try and write I try to write this book where the the feeling is there with the minimum amount of words
[00:38:48] Get the point across with the minimum amount of words
[00:38:50] It does add drama to it
[00:38:55] That because even in real life this book aside
[00:38:59] Like it's more dramatic that way well I also say all the time the less you talk to more people listen
[00:39:04] Yeah, I give that as leadership counsel hey if you're in there and you got something to say in a meeting and you say it in
[00:39:12] 14 sentences and it takes you seven minutes
[00:39:14] Yeah, maybe 14 second maybe maybe maybe it takes you seven minutes to say something
[00:39:21] That you could have said in
[00:39:23] 14 seconds the 14 second route was way is way preferred of course and it's gonna have so much more impact
[00:39:31] Yes, but let's face it the added specifically added drama
[00:39:36] Is undeniable like so if if we're here. I don't know let's say we had to I don't know make key chains or something and
[00:39:43] There was like a hundred thousand key chains that needed to be made and we get here five p.m. whatever and I ask you
[00:39:51] And you're like yeah, we need to get these done or whatever and then I look at them and go hey, are we gonna do all these tonight and and
[00:39:57] There's two different scenarios where you could be like you know what yeah, we're gonna we're gonna get all these done tonight or you could just look at me
[00:40:05] I know are the answers fucking yes, yeah, oh, it's hell. He has much way much dramatic
[00:40:09] Yeah, you don't even say anything say anything right or you could pull which would you typically do you'll just say yes and that's it
[00:40:17] I want more I want you to make me feel good. I want to but it's just this big black hole of
[00:40:23] Nothingness that I'm just left with except for yes like with that you you got to make of it
[00:40:29] Whatever you're gonna make of it, but yes, you know, so it's like how we merge back
[00:40:34] Good so that's what the book is written like
[00:40:36] Um
[00:40:38] I we're gonna roll into don't just trying to give some of the characters right some of the some of the characters here's the
[00:40:46] I guess this is our leading female character in the book here we go
[00:40:54] She is a pretty but tough looking girl
[00:40:57] thick black hair that wants to curl but is for the most part stringed by its own weight and volume
[00:41:04] pale skin dark eyes eyes with a hint of fight left in them
[00:41:12] But most of the fight is gone
[00:41:16] Born away by long hours and hard work and worn away by the reality of life
[00:41:24] Jessica
[00:41:26] Where have you been she asks working where else Johnny responds defensively you can't call or anything
[00:41:34] Sorry he replies. I'm a prick. Yeah, you are she says
[00:41:39] You never held that against me before don't start now you buy me a drink and I'll forgive you Lucy
[00:41:45] So-co and coke Johnny shouts to the bar made so-co and coke got it the bartender response
[00:41:51] How's work Johnny asks
[00:41:53] although he knows the answer
[00:41:55] The usual marks an asshole everybody comes into that place is a fucking asshole and I do what I do
[00:42:02] Smiling kiss their ass. Why don't you quit Johnny asks?
[00:42:05] It's an earnest question even though the answer is known by him
[00:42:10] She knows the answer to she also has the same question why don't you quit your fucking job stock boy
[00:42:18] Ouch
[00:42:19] Thanks Johnny mutters ejected
[00:42:21] Well, I mean fuck of course I'd quit that job same as you but who's gonna pay the rent?
[00:42:27] The bartender approaches them and places the Southern comforting coke in front of Jessica
[00:42:31] So-co and coke she says matter of fact thanks Lucy
[00:42:35] Johnny tells her thanks Johnny Jessica says to Johnny
[00:42:39] Anything for you darling he says with a smile
[00:42:42] Great your horny she says hey he replies defensively. I'm just don't worry
[00:42:49] I am too she says with a smile
[00:42:55] So there's Jessica
[00:42:59] Again, where does Jessica come from kind of a composite character of
[00:43:05] Growing up of traveling
[00:43:07] If we've gone in different towns different cities
[00:43:10] Restaurants bars, you know, she's a waitress
[00:43:13] I know many Jessica's in my time and like you said
[00:43:18] I think we've all known plenty of Jessica's and and look she's hard working
[00:43:24] She's determined what she's up against the odds
[00:43:27] And she's also productive and you learn this in the book she's a product of some bad decisions or at least some decisions that aren't great ones
[00:43:34] Right so she kind of ends up in her
[00:43:38] stuck in this position as well and and to quote Harvey Kytel
[00:43:43] From reservoir dogs. Yes, her waitressing is the number one job for female non college graduates in this country
[00:43:52] And I always I always you know because I worked in restaurants man
[00:43:57] That's a freaking hard job and you got a smile
[00:44:01] Right, yeah kind of customer service. It's got a smile
[00:44:05] So not only are you working a hard job and people are treating you bad in some cases
[00:44:09] Yeah, where this is in cook good enough
[00:44:13] By the way if you if you ever are serving me and I return something to kitchen
[00:44:17] It is totally jacked up because if it's not a totally jacked up. I'm just gonna like just like it
[00:44:23] I mean you got to give me a raw bleeding piece of meat if you think I'm gonna return to the kitchen
[00:44:28] What about the wrong thing so you can use you straight up the wrong thing they mess your order up wrong thing is it
[00:44:32] Some mum down with
[00:44:34] You know like is it okay isn't like hey, I ordered the rib eye get a piece of primer
[00:44:39] Go I'll eat it. What if you get a fish
[00:44:41] Probably going back
[00:44:43] I'll be cool about it. Yeah, I'll probably just say you know what I might do in that situation. This is how nice
[00:44:48] I am like it
[00:44:49] Nice to say yeah, no because I'd probably be like hey, you know, I'm also interested in getting a steak and you bring your rib eye
[00:44:54] You get both of my things
[00:44:56] Yeah, maybe maybe put that in a z-o and I dog you bag or something do you uh do you?
[00:45:02] On the inside do you actually feel bad that you have to do? Yes, you have to you feel bad
[00:45:06] Yeah, I don't like I don't like I don't like messing with waitresses. I don't like you know anybody in service, right?
[00:45:14] You know anybody in service. I don't like being that guy. Yeah, the the proverbial guy, right? That's like
[00:45:21] Yeah, man. Can you hurry up with that? Yeah, you know I'm the guy that be like a you know
[00:45:27] I guess I guess I'm not drinking water and I haven't seen a long run awhile
[00:45:31] Well
[00:45:35] But hey, you know when someone does good service like I'm definitely gonna take care of them too
[00:45:39] Yeah, you know, that's what we're doing but that's Jessica right we get this she's sort of she's got honestly
[00:45:45] She's kind of like a female Johnny in a way, right? She's smart. She's good looking
[00:45:51] She's witty but
[00:45:53] Maybe not the best choices maybe she didn't roll out in the best environment and
[00:45:57] And that's addressed to in the book you know there's some there's some level of ownership that gets you know
[00:46:01] Responsibility for our actions and she's the one that kind of pushes that like hey you can sit around here because
[00:46:08] At a certain point I don't get too much into it, but Johnny started saying well, you know we didn't I didn't have the right up bringing in all this and she's like hey dude
[00:46:17] No one made you quit
[00:46:19] school no one made you do this no one made you you did those things
[00:46:23] Um, but like you said these are these are
[00:46:29] These are people these are normal people these are people in the world these are people I grew up with these are my friends to this day
[00:46:38] People I met along the way
[00:46:41] Now
[00:46:42] That's kind of your main characters one more character I want to introduce and they look there's a bunch
[00:46:47] There are a lot more characters in the book
[00:46:49] I didn't say a lot more I tried to limit the number of characters as much as possible right I don't want to have this big complex
[00:46:57] Story line that's hard to follow. I wanted it to be when you heard someone I want you just to know who it is and boom your locked
[00:47:04] That was my goal simplicity
[00:47:09] There's another character
[00:47:11] That I want I do want to bring up because he does you got some he's got some a little bit of impact
[00:47:16] And this character as you heard from the review from the publisher weekly review Johnny and go they work at a big box store
[00:47:23] And their boss is this guy named Gerald Lundstrom
[00:47:30] Jerry also known as Jerry and they call him
[00:47:33] The Weasel that's what they call so let's get an introduction to
[00:47:38] Gerald Lundstrom the Weasel let's get an introduction to the big box store
[00:47:42] To what their jobs are and what they do there
[00:47:47] Their stock boys so here we go
[00:47:51] You would think Americans

[00:48:10] Every day from the time the doors open until they close there are customers here
[00:48:16] buying milk and batteries and toilet paper and garbage bags
[00:48:21] Tomatoes popcorn salami
[00:48:25] People can buy anything here and they do
[00:48:28] Consumption in massive quantities to fill their massive bellies and run up their massive credit card debt
[00:48:36] People
[00:48:38] flesh cover grow-bob beings in need of fuel and meaning
[00:48:43] They find both here
[00:48:46] I mean honestly who the fuck needs a half a gallon of miracle whip for their house goat asks
[00:48:51] Honestly trying to comprehend this madness well obviously a bunch of people need it all this will be gone in a couple of days
[00:48:58] Go shakes his head what the hell do they do with it
[00:49:02] Do they put it in their cereal or something? I think they butter their wives up with it
[00:49:06] God damn that's fucking disgusting yet is Johnny agrees
[00:49:11] From the end of the aisle allowed high pitched voice breaks their conversation
[00:49:17] Jerry the night manager
[00:49:19] You guys need to stop talking and get that stuff stacked up less talking and more stocking
[00:49:26] We still got pickles mustard, Chris go and can ham
[00:49:30] I got your can ham go whispers under his breath
[00:49:33] Jerry walks toward goat and Johnny
[00:49:38] Finn
[00:49:39] late 30s
[00:49:41] Smoker
[00:49:42] greasy hair
[00:49:44] beige Levi dockers
[00:49:47] polo shirt
[00:49:49] yellow
[00:49:50] Gold colored necklace with cross gold colored watch
[00:49:55] fake
[00:49:57] What did you say Jerry asked aggressively?
[00:49:59] goat stand up goat stands up straight and belts out I said I got your caned ham
[00:50:07] Jerry shakes his head he tries to think of an original comeback but he can't think of anything good
[00:50:12] He resorts to all he knows well you just keep running your mouth like that and we'll see if you ever make
[00:50:17] Supervisor
[00:50:19] Not wanting to engage in a verbal battle Jerry quickly walks away
[00:50:23] goat stands there shaking his head mother fucker he says quietly
[00:50:30] Then unable to contain himself shouts supervise this you weasel look in mother fucker
[00:50:37] Johnny looks at him
[00:50:39] I'd fucking kill myself if I ever made supervisor at this shit hole
[00:50:42] Yeah, not fucking prick walking around like he's fucking Steve Jobs
[00:50:47] loser fucking loser
[00:50:48] At least he's easy to rip off Johnny concedes he has got that going form
[00:50:55] I'm getting a couple bottles of jack tonight goats has
[00:50:59] getting the nasty as rot gut gin I can find
[00:51:06] So there you go that's the manager have you ever had a manager like like my boy like the weasel
[00:51:14] Yes, there you go
[00:51:15] God
[00:51:17] Do I need to do character development or do we know who Jerry the weasel lunch term is right?
[00:51:24] We're gonna use the schema unknown in the first and um
[00:51:28] I had so much fun writing that dialogue a her chocolate hard k dog behind the scenes over there chocolate
[00:51:33] I was wrong some of the just because that's what it's like right you know you're 22 23 years old
[00:51:40] You're having you have a crap job
[00:51:42] You know you don't they've broke
[00:51:45] Yeah, he was a stock boy at Target and she was a stockboy when he was a target and he was like 15
[00:51:55] And he's like you nailed the you nailed that dialogue you nailed those characters
[00:51:59] And I go how's that I said how can that be you weren't like that and he was no I wasn't like that
[00:52:03] I was 15 just trying to do a good job and trying to get money he goes but I worked with guys
[00:52:08] That shouldn't have been working there that we're 22 23 24 years old and I would hear them talking and you freaking nailed it
[00:52:17] He's guys talk to each other and talk shit
[00:52:22] So we all know managers like this kind of a
[00:52:26] stereotypical manager
[00:52:29] And that's the way the world kind of gets put together for this book now
[00:52:33] Again, I don't want to spend I don't want to start covering the plot of the book you kind of heard it from the review a little bit of what happens in the plot
[00:52:40] You don't get the whole deal, but that's sort of the directional heading in gotta get the book to get there
[00:52:45] But I did want to kind of just talk about some of the
[00:52:50] themes some of the other themes that are in the book
[00:52:54] One of them is is kind of this
[00:52:57] Ideal of being obsessed with random things which we all certainly do I do we all end up obsessed with these random things and if you look at it from the outside
[00:53:08] It doesn't make any sense so jiu jitsu
[00:53:13] surfing
[00:53:15] archery
[00:53:17] rock climbing music guitars
[00:53:20] NASCAR
[00:53:22] Leap lawn super into your lawn right super into fishing super into yoga super into cooking
[00:53:29] Super into grit like there's all these things that people just get into and
[00:53:36] That level of obsession
[00:53:38] Could be about anything right and that was that was one of the fun things that I had with already was
[00:53:44] I was thinking what would be the most random kind of thing that you could be obsessed with how about
[00:53:48] Laundry do laundry but there's not that much difference between being obsessed with doing laundry and and
[00:53:55] Archery yeah, and I'm believe me. I'm pretty obsessed with archery. I spend a bunch of time doing it. I spent money on it like
[00:54:03] Why
[00:54:04] I could be making super clean clothes
[00:54:07] Jiu jitsu hey we're super in a jitsu yeah, we could talk about this freaking skill on this and that but
[00:54:12] At this point we have kind of the basic skills that we need to defend ourselves. We're just doing it
[00:54:19] All-nother reason right lawns right like lawn care people get fired up for that stuff
[00:54:27] So that's something that we do
[00:54:30] It's an underlying theme in the book is man think about what you're doing. What do you obsess with why you obsess with it
[00:54:37] We're getting this weird stuff. Yeah
[00:54:39] Yeah, it is weird.
[00:54:41] consumerism
[00:54:43] Buying stuff as another thing we do you wrap that you wrap the obsession around
[00:54:48] Also around a consumerism buying stuff and
[00:54:52] If you've ever been to a big box store, which I certainly have been too many and
[00:54:58] Still go to
[00:55:00] Or Sasha should say still shop at because
[00:55:03] Because I don't go to them very often. I'm okay my wife kind of gets that done
[00:55:06] But you go into those places and it's so we consume a lot of stuff right and here's here's what I think is interesting and now I days you know this this this book takes place
[00:55:18] in the
[00:55:19] Early 90s late 80s. I'm gonna say early 90s
[00:55:23] So there's no cell phones
[00:55:27] But one thing that I've found that I think I believe and you can tell me what you think
[00:55:32] I think we I think have you ever built something?
[00:55:34] Yes, sir. I have any gave that took you some time and effort
[00:55:39] What's the biggest thing you've ever built big biggest yeah, I don't know but
[00:55:44] That wasn't that did not come from IKEA
[00:55:47] Yeah, so okay, so I don't know the biggest thing that's gonna take a lot from me think of but the thing that did jump out at me was I used to make slingshots
[00:55:56] one of the kids okay so
[00:55:58] You go down in my case I go down the valley the canyon
[00:56:05] And you'd find a guava tree and I like the guava tree would you and then you find where there's like a perfect
[00:56:11] Why it can be like too narrow of a split got to be any can't be too wide either a lot of those
[00:56:17] You got to find the perfect one
[00:56:19] When we cut it cut it all three spots and you bring it back
[00:56:23] You skin it
[00:56:25] Let it dry for a little bit like a few days or whatever
[00:56:27] I used it this is when I went extra on it. I'd sand it down so it looks kind of cool
[00:56:33] You can put finish on it. I never really did that and then you go by it's called surgical tubing
[00:56:39] Then you yeah, you attach them and then you cut off the tongue of your shoe
[00:56:44] I'm like an old shoe or whatever you cut it off and then poke the two holes
[00:56:48] Use a knife or even like a whole puncher. It's harder to do the whole puncher, but you know you did the two holes attach the
[00:56:54] Surgery surgical tubing what I would do is I do this
[00:56:57] Circle surgical tubing go in the hole curl back. I'd super glue it together
[00:57:02] Wrap it with thread not too tight because it might start cutting into when it starts to oxidize a little bit and then tape like small piece of tape
[00:57:09] It would be super strong super strong the same thing both sides are all four
[00:57:13] Attachments and boom there you go looks nice too
[00:57:16] How did you feel when you were complete? Yeah amazing that's why I do a bunch of them like I don't need like five slingshots
[00:57:22] But yeah, yeah, I got the two or three going so I think there's some I don't know there's probably some
[00:57:28] Chemical dopamine hit or whatever that get when you actually do something when you build something like I've built
[00:57:35] So like like redoing my house like re-mod like ripping out gutting my hat one time I did my kitchen and I gutted it
[00:57:45] In 72 hours I gutted the whole thing demoed it got it out
[00:57:52] Readed the electrical read the plumbing
[00:57:56] Put in a sub box what's that called? I put in a sub box for the electrical
[00:58:02] I forget what it's called but I put in like a whole new electrical system and then I dry walled it
[00:58:07] And I did that all in 72 hours and but you feel like accomplishment right?
[00:58:16] Building like fences at my houses building I I remodeled my other house so like these major projects
[00:58:25] You feel this good sense of satisfaction when you're done
[00:58:28] Well in the modern world we do a lot less of that right so what so you can replace that sort of satisfaction
[00:58:36] By clicking on the Amazon whatever by now right and all of a sudden you feel like but the thing is since you didn't put much effort into it
[00:58:45] It's not that gratifying so you want to do it again. Yeah, so I think that's why people roll in the freaking Costco
[00:58:51] They roll in the Costco and they roll out with way more stuff because they just walk through those eyes getting that dopamine hit
[00:58:57] Dopamine hit
[00:59:00] Because they feel like they built
[00:59:02] That thing or they harvest it. Yeah, it's the same thing when you go hunting and you like harvest the meat
[00:59:10] Super gratifying
[00:59:12] Super like
[00:59:14] 1000 times more gratifying
[00:59:17] Then buying a stake at the store and believe me buying a stake at the store is kind of gratifying too
[00:59:22] But you get that dopamine you're like oh yeah, then we're this gonna be so good
[00:59:25] But it's way less so you buy another one, right? You know, then you buy this and you buy that right?
[00:59:30] Yeah, that's weird huh, so it's kind of like when you kind of
[00:59:33] Maybe cut it all the way down to what that's going on with that little transaction
[00:59:38] It's like you know like almost for like better way of putting it in the wild or in the you know nature whatever
[00:59:45] You put in this work and then you
[00:59:47] You run through some challenges you overcome those challenges then you get the reward right?
[00:59:53] That sort of the system and your brain
[00:59:55] You know follow along accordingly boom you put in the work you get obsessive over it
[01:00:00] You run into a challenge you overcome the challenge and you're back on your path to you know for that main goal
[01:00:05] You know and the heart of you work the bigger the reward usually right?
[01:00:08] It's far as in your brain like the bigger the payoff you know, so it's like if you go for a
[01:00:12] College and then you then you really finally reap that reward in your case. It's hunting the elk or you know
[01:00:17] Whatever whatever the reward is the prize right there boom there's your your ultimate
[01:00:22] Satisfying dopamine hit whatever but now
[01:00:28] It's the same thing except you reduce the work parts so much, but you still get the little reward
[01:00:33] You know, but here's the thing you reduce the work the reward you get rewarded, but it's less work
[01:00:38] Less rewards, so what do you do you do to get less satisfying?
[01:00:40] Yeah, it's not much you just do it again. Oh, yeah, the culminate order this. I'm gonna buy that
[01:00:45] And see you end up in this sort of weird cycle of
[01:00:48] of
[01:00:50] Satisfaction by just buying stuff
[01:00:52] Brad the and you know, and we've talked about this two brothers the people who make the stores
[01:00:56] The layout and stuff all they know about that kind of stuff. That's why there's a thing called impulse buy right
[01:01:01] So they put the candy right there by the checkout stuff that you didn't plan on getting
[01:01:05] But it's like
[01:01:05] I think he's one of those right now. You know kind of a thing it's like a impulse by you ever get
[01:01:11] I don't see you doing this, but maybe you do I don't know, but you know when you shop it on Amazon right and
[01:01:15] And me I get a lot of care will relate to this where I get a lot of little cables and little tools
[01:01:22] In whatever you know just for this thing or that thing or whatever and then when you check out or when you add it to the cart
[01:01:27] They'll introduce all these other things
[01:01:29] You can't play it. It's a bot
[01:01:31] Yeah, then I'm like yeah, you sure you're like double me. No, no, oh, yeah
[01:01:35] I could use that never gonna use it, but I could imagine myself using this pair of pliers
[01:01:40] You know, so many I have two pairs of pliers by the way, I already
[01:01:43] But that one with the red handle and I was kind of dope. I'm headed as a little thing on the side. I am the I am the most
[01:01:49] I research stuff to the point where it's stupid you can try to get me to buy something
[01:01:54] I was looking at
[01:01:56] I was looking at one of my kids
[01:01:59] Yeah, my kids Instagram and my my daughter was like oh, I have an advertisement every third
[01:02:06] Whatever picture is an advertisement
[01:02:08] And I go that no like oh, I hardly have any and I she's like no way and I showed her and I have like almost a no
[01:02:15] Promoted ads
[01:02:16] We know why I never click on them and they know I'm like low
[01:02:21] Low conversion conversion I'm like the lowest conversion ever
[01:02:24] I'm not even wasting their money throwing that thing you're crawling for me because you you could have the best freaking idea in the world
[01:02:30] And I'm gonna start like I'm gonna have to research that
[01:02:33] Yeah, I'm surprised Amazon just doesn't check me out without showing me anything because they're just over
[01:02:39] But yeah, don't even try
[01:02:42] So that's an underlying theme, but here's here's the here's the kind of the real
[01:02:48] I don't know maybe it's that maybe it's the heaviest underlying theme is just the idea and it is it's about happiness, right?
[01:02:57] Not only about happiness, but this sort of underlying
[01:03:01] Being
[01:03:03] Unappiness in the world underlying sadness in the world
[01:03:08] When I was a kid and I was working in Wendy's and I saw a gene and I saw that she was freaking happy
[01:03:21] And I knew
[01:03:23] That I wasn't
[01:03:25] And I didn't even know if I could be it didn't seem like an achievable thing it seemed like there was too much
[01:03:34] It seemed like there was too much
[01:03:38] Underlying
[01:03:40] Things in the world that just are gonna be bad
[01:03:44] Right
[01:03:45] And I always sense that in the world I always sensed always I always had this sense in the world of this underlying sadness
[01:03:52] Is underlying despair this underlying suffering
[01:03:57] And I don't want to use the term depression because maybe you wrap all those things together because depression seems like it's a clinical
[01:04:04] Sort of like a problem that you treat type thing and I didn't feel like this was a clinical problem
[01:04:10] It just seemed like life to me
[01:04:15] Was not the gonna go the way you wanted it to go
[01:04:17] Go
[01:04:20] For anyone
[01:04:23] You're gonna end up in a wrong job you're gonna end up in the wrong relationship you're gonna something's gonna be wrong with your health
[01:04:29] Something's gonna be wrong in your family
[01:04:32] And we're gonna die I we're all gonna die and before we died we're gonna suffer
[01:04:38] And by the way everyone that you know and everyone that you love is gonna suffer and die
[01:04:42] I
[01:04:46] And so I would always I kind of had this underlying sense of the world
[01:04:54] And then I would catch like glimpses of people that were happy and
[01:05:00] Sometimes it was someone like Jean there was another guy that worked at a freaking junkyard
[01:05:04] Who was kind of jacked?
[01:05:06] Especially when I was younger you know when you were younger and in the in the 70s if someone was jacked in the 70s like it was a whole
[01:05:16] It was like the next level right
[01:05:19] Because you're you're not used to seeing people that are jacked at all and I remember seeing this guy who has
[01:05:25] It worked at a junkyard and
[01:05:27] And he looked happy and I was like dude this guy's just jacked and just lived in engine parts around the junkyard
[01:05:37] And it seemed like he was happy
[01:05:40] So
[01:05:42] That's sort of this underlying team and I'll tell you like when I got to the teams thank god
[01:05:49] When I got to the teams that's when I started feeling like oh
[01:05:51] Like kind of happy like this is cool that people on with are kind of cool and life's not going to be perfect
[01:05:58] But we're going to have a good time living this imperfect life
[01:06:02] So I started to get a little bit relieved of that as I got a little as I got older
[01:06:08] But I think that
[01:06:10] You know Johnny kind of realizes that he's not going to be happy
[01:06:16] And this is the other sort of the other sort of underlying theme
[01:06:19] is this idea of
[01:06:26] Sacrifice and
[01:06:29] When Johnny realizes that he can't be happy or at least he doesn't think he can't happy
[01:06:35] He sees that you know kind of the way I looked at Jean the Wendy salad bar girl
[01:06:41] But that's his brother
[01:06:43] And the situation unfolds where he's not going to be able to be happy anymore where where
[01:06:49] Arty is not going to be happy anymore and
[01:06:51] Johnny knows if he makes sacrifices he could preserve the happiness for his brother
[01:06:58] Especially because he's never going to be happy himself
[01:07:02] um
[01:07:05] You know I had this conversation with stoner one time we're out surfing and he was asking me that we said bro
[01:07:11] I don't know it's like the same thing
[01:07:14] He's like bro, I'm never going to be out how you how am I ever going to be happy? I'm never going to be happy
[01:07:19] You know we were literally it's like a beautiful
[01:07:22] Southern California we're out in our surf spot
[01:07:26] For whatever reason there's not many guys out there's a little offshore breeze the waters warm
[01:07:31] It's a you know chest to head high swell pretty consistent like it's it doesn't get any better
[01:07:37] Hmm and he's out of here saying to me like I don't know how do you ever how you ever find happiness and I'm like bro
[01:07:45] This is it man. This is it right here and that's what you
[01:07:52] Know that's what that's what you have to be able to find
[01:07:56] You have to be able to find that the path that you're on
[01:08:00] Would even though it's challenging even though they're suffering that's that's the happiness too
[01:08:11] And the sacrifice part is putting others above yourself. You know and obviously on this podcast we talk about heroes and we talk to heroes in many cases
[01:08:19] And both the ones that we talk to here are military people right soldiers sailors airman Marines
[01:08:31] But those aren't the only people
[01:08:32] It doesn't the only people in the world that are heroes right and and I'm not just talking about law enforcement and you know firefighters and first responders
[01:08:39] Well, there's all kinds of people in the world that put others above themselves
[01:08:44] And put other people's happiness above themselves and
[01:08:51] And whether that's mothers and fathers and
[01:08:57] Sisters and brothers and wives and husband and friends. I mean there's friends that do that
[01:09:03] Friends that put other people's happiness and other people's success above themselves and
[01:09:14] Really that's that's the underl... that's one of the other underlying themes of the book
[01:09:20] Is and that you know that's that's a theme that's consistent with all the books that have written fiction nonfiction people that are putting others above themselves
[01:09:30] That's what leadership is and
[01:09:32] Ultimately
[01:09:36] That's what life is about
[01:09:40] So
[01:09:44] I think if you can put other others before yourselves
[01:09:49] Then if we do that then you can find some happiness and add a minimum at a minimum
[01:09:56] You can leave the world in better condition than you found it
[01:09:58] And
[01:10:01] If you can pull that off I think if you can pull that off
[01:10:06] Then you can die with a clean and conscience and you can die with a smile on your face
[01:10:12] And you can leave a smile on the face of the people you left behind
[01:10:20] And that's a good life
[01:10:25] And that is
[01:10:27] I mean
[01:10:32] So
[01:10:34] We can't obviously cover the whole plot the details what we'll do is maybe in a year
[01:10:38] Remember what we did with
[01:10:40] Musashi yeah with Musashi so this is episode
[01:10:44] 301
[01:10:46] episode 401
[01:10:49] That's actually two years isn't it?
[01:10:51] Yeah
[01:10:53] People two years to sort it out is that long not what we do one year so we do so we say 350
[01:11:02] Okay, we'll go 350 will shoot for 350 so 350 will do full spoiler will just tell everyone what's going on
[01:11:09] We'll take a bunch of questions about the book
[01:11:14] And yeah, we'll do it again what we can go a little bit deeper on all the plot
[01:11:19] You know as I start getting feedback from people and people start asking all those awesome questions that you ask when you read books and what's this part about?
[01:11:26] What is this represent we'll do all that?
[01:11:30] The books for for sale right now
[01:11:34] I would order it if I were you why I think clearly because you want that first of this
[01:11:39] And there's another this is us against the establishment by the way
[01:11:43] This is us against the literary critics
[01:11:46] Right this is us against the big publishing companies the media companies
[01:11:52] Where did the outsiders I'm an outsider I'm telling you what I go to New York City
[01:11:56] And I roll into those publishing offices I am an outsider I might as well be purple
[01:12:06] Because I'm not from that world right
[01:12:09] They don't they the interesting thing is I mean I was an English major in college
[01:12:12] They don't know about that they just look at me think knuckle dragger
[01:12:19] Meathead which I take is a compliment. Yes, certainly
[01:12:24] But yeah, they don't want us to win so
[01:12:28] Join the cause right
[01:12:30] Let's let's let's let's take the fight to them
[01:12:34] Get that first edition and here's the other thing I was planning to do a
[01:12:37] Speaking thing kind of like jockel live what we did last year right before COVID hit I was we were booking it up and the whole freaking
[01:12:47] The industry still paranoid and a bunch of the venues started getting crazy with the way they were gonna run them and some of them wanted to cancel
[01:12:55] And so I said all right fine, we'll put it off so I'm gonna do a jockel live tour with this
[01:13:01] I don't know I don't know what cities I'm going to the only city I
[01:13:04] Keep saying I want to go to is Detroit
[01:13:09] I just want to go to Detroit and by the way, there's so you knew Jack White is
[01:13:16] Jack White stripes. Oh, I'm thinking totally
[01:13:19] No, I do now. Yeah, so he's got a thing up in
[01:13:23] Detroit
[01:13:25] He's got a
[01:13:26] place where he can record
[01:13:29] Bands
[01:13:30] Straight to vinyl
[01:13:32] So it just straight to vinyl. I think it's a venue that holds like 50 people
[01:13:38] So I want to do jockel live there. I want to record it straight to the white
[01:13:41] Yeah, and this get
[01:13:43] Artisan on us yeah, bro straight to vinyl house
[01:13:47] I think it might be the only place in America where you can do that
[01:13:52] That sounds correct and plus the white stripes are awesome jackwights freaking awesome
[01:13:56] So that would be sick to do so I'm gonna try and go to Detroit maybe after do a big show before that
[01:14:02] To get everyone in there, but then after that
[01:14:05] We'll go straight to third man records
[01:14:07] Straight to vinyl
[01:14:09] Do you have a record player? Yeah
[01:14:11] Let's look into that one one my Amazon spirals the record player they have a lot. Oh, he's yeah
[01:14:18] It's vinyl dude. Yeah, it's not going right. It's just we're talking about people being obsessed with things
[01:14:23] Yeah, vinyl's one of them yeah get that vinyl out that record sounds better allegedly
[01:14:29] I remember there's there's a motorhead album where he put in between the songs on the CD
[01:14:36] Has like the record sound like this
[01:14:40] Come out back pretty sick, right? Yeah, well that's I mean even with film that's all right
[01:14:45] It's like no film looks like way better video end and photography
[01:14:48] They're like not film all day. Yeah, I'll walk
[01:14:51] Black did this lame lame doesn't look as good does it look as natural doesn't look as you know
[01:14:58] Doesn't flow with your senses
[01:15:01] So Detroit that's one city. I know I'm going to why cuz we want to get flow with our senses
[01:15:06] Yes, sir. We're going straight to vinyl industry to vinyl. I don't even know if it's a possible thing
[01:15:11] I don't I don't know if it's possible
[01:15:12] Bet you know people might be like you can't do that you need you're not even a band
[01:15:16] No, I'm gonna talk though. Yeah, it's an out you've done albums
[01:15:19] We have no withdrawing milk right so this would be an album now. I'm straight up
[01:15:25] You've been to jockel lives. Yes, sir. I have some of the money being cool record right
[01:15:30] Yes, sir. They would be
[01:15:32] vinyl vinyl all day man. Then you get clear vinyl you get the red vinyl right? You don't say
[01:15:38] I don't know what red vinyl is but the vinyl's red that's what red vinyl is where you get the clear vinyl
[01:15:42] What's clear vinyl clear the record's clear you can see through it
[01:15:45] You're heard of it. I never heard of that okay dogs in the house in the game. Yeah, oh
[01:15:52] So when I do that thing, but I guess it's gonna be spring or something like that we'll go live
[01:16:00] We'll hang out if you're rolling up you got that second edition. Let's face it
[01:16:05] I'm still appreciative
[01:16:08] But you know I know we all know where you're at
[01:16:12] Yeah, appreciate the support. Let's crush the world with this book
[01:16:19] Echo speaking of crush in the world we kind of have to crush ourselves
[01:16:25] Right in order to crush the world which by the way. Hey, you tougher. Yeah, which by the way
[01:16:29] I came just came back from hunting and for I think it was 13 days. I did not lift weights
[01:16:36] Because I was in the mountains
[01:16:38] Or as I call mountains but I came back and I was all fired up, you know and felt like I need
[01:16:46] Man I have domes in my arms right now
[01:16:49] In my I haven't had domes in my arms in a long time
[01:16:54] So we got across ourselves that can take a toll at times
[01:16:58] What do we need to do to kind of stay on the path to get better? Well, so we across the world
[01:17:02] Well, keep in mind mentally and physically. Domes in the arms that indicates that you're working out your arms which I respect
[01:17:11] So you know, I'm sorry they have the dump but welcome to my world
[01:17:19] Well, okay, so we want to minimize domes. Well, no, no maximize yet minimize mitigate domes. Okay. Yeah, I would say that's a good call. It's kind of a dichotomy really
[01:17:28] Mm-hmm, but let's face it would you would you want to have domes every day on your arms with that include that
[01:17:38] Increased progress or not
[01:17:41] If you bad, right you know, I obviously there's a lot to it, but generally speaking simply put
[01:17:46] Domes every day. No, probably not okay. You want when the domes heels
[01:17:50] Then you want to elicit more domes and what do I have?
[01:17:53] But that's a process is then it's ongoing unless all right what you do need a supplementation that'll help you
[01:17:59] Do domes or no domes right on you
[01:18:03] So through this path rolling on supplementation is very helpful. So we'll talk about energy drinks first
[01:18:09] Right as far as energy see I know I said it energy drinks
[01:18:13] As if that is if what we're talking about fits in with all the other categories of all these other
[01:18:18] Drinks that are in the energy drink category. Yeah, so man, you know me if you're new to this when they're not
[01:18:24] There's things that they don't don't that stigma that you felt like in your brain
[01:18:28] I would ever order you drink so that stigma don't worry about that that's dig many more in fact forget that's digma forget it
[01:18:34] Don't totally forget it because there's other drinks that still have you need to keep the stigma in mind
[01:18:39] Yeah, but you can have the stigma of waitings. Yes, like you'd like like detach from the state
[01:18:44] Yeah, but that leave it behind just leave it behind it doesn't control your brain and how you think of energy drinks
[01:18:49] necessarily anymore if you know about
[01:18:52] Jocco go okay, I can is a discipline go or jocco go it is
[01:18:57] Jocco discipline go like I agree speaking I got corrected by someone on the inside which I respected by the way
[01:19:03] But either way
[01:19:05] Go
[01:19:06] Jocco discipline go said energy drink that is good for you front to back good for you not the kind where you drinking
[01:19:12] And
[01:19:14] You know what have you ever seen that there's this commercial I think one of these comedy YouTube
[01:19:20] Channels they're like oh if some like if energy drink commercials were honest or whatever they call it like a
[01:19:26] A metal tube of
[01:19:28] Psychedelic poison and something but if they they kept referring to it as a metal tube but some kind of place
[01:19:34] Accurate yeah, oh, Brad watch the video. It's funny. You're like they own that is all true
[01:19:39] That is it's interesting either way it's not that the stomach of the sis no poison
[01:19:44] It's different. Yeah, actually good for you. It's good for you. It's like a health
[01:19:48] Drink energy drink, but even though that makes it sound kind of like not really what it feels like
[01:19:53] Just keep in mind. It's an energy drink a taste good is good and it's good for you and
[01:19:58] gives you energy and gives you legit no chemicals
[01:20:02] These weird preservative things because of process high quality it's quality
[01:20:08] Many flavors the best in which is mango factually
[01:20:15] Yeah, but you're gonna have to choose for yourself on that one. It's called jocco go. Oh
[01:20:18] That junk warfare. Yes, sir. To come into it. Yeah, I I must say even joint welfare has its limitations because I
[01:20:25] Need more right now. I take it every day. Thank God because otherwise I might need to be completely immobilized right now
[01:20:34] Well, you're delayed up here's thing drone warfare is not gonna help your dogs. I really I mean
[01:20:38] I mean me what is the problem the problem the protein protein is not help your dog
[01:20:42] So joints joint warfare super curl
[01:20:46] Right but when it comes to actual rebuild
[01:20:50] We need to go moke. Yep. That's for the muscle. Yes
[01:20:53] Additional protein in the form of the dessert. I know what I had for breakfast this morning
[01:20:58] Which I normally don't eat moke
[01:21:01] Guess what I had for lunch? Moke because I could I knew what you just don't look the doms
[01:21:06] I know it needs to be yes, sir. I need to repair my muscles. Oh yeah freaking so or dude
[01:21:13] By the way, speaking of moke the the new and you actually all the ingredients were in front of my face
[01:21:18] But you turn me on to this or to the precursor of this new formula for the ultimate moke shake depends on what flavor
[01:21:25] You like but if you like the chocolate one, this is the one
[01:21:27] Mint chocolate or dark chocolate or a
[01:21:30] Peanut butter chocolate whichever one you want
[01:21:33] Half of a half of a frozen banana over right
[01:21:38] Tulsi gear return me on to that. Okay, so we got it you know a little a collab going on
[01:21:42] Frozen half a frozen banana two scoops of the moke. I did the darkness
[01:21:48] Soy milk you know cuz like soy silk. I don't know whatever the one that it doesn't have lactose in it
[01:21:54] It's super low, okay if you go regular milk and you're concerned about if you're trying to go lower on the calorie thing
[01:22:00] Regular milk even 2% is not the best one for
[01:22:05] Because I'm over here on the whole milk. Yeah, I'm strong
[01:22:08] Half and half. Oh, you're not
[01:22:09] Open this you know well you're not going on a lower calorie scenario
[01:22:13] It's basic you can't you know your little machine can't handle that can stuff you know way if you are
[01:22:17] This is the deal because I was gonna give it to the kids for the ultimate front end test you seem saying
[01:22:23] Anyway, you go half
[01:22:25] Soy milk or almond milk whatever the unsweetened one and then half of that it's lactose free
[01:22:30] It was the chocolate milk that you you mentioned. Oh, yeah, it's like lactose free
[01:22:34] There's way less sugar and it's like double triple filtered or whatever
[01:22:38] Yeah, and you go half that too. Oh just for the extra boost of chocolate or whatever
[01:22:44] Man drink that on a taste like ice cream
[01:22:47] I think the banana but it's not a whole banana so you don't get the real super banana flavor
[01:22:51] But you get the sweetness from the banana and probably taste like it's ice cream for real
[01:22:55] Yeah, oh yeah put ice in there boom mix that up there you go milk protein in the form of a
[01:23:00] Highly desirable dessert highly desir highly desir highly I'm just right now already have two
[01:23:09] That's a well it's true also chocolate tea you're into tea you know something light
[01:23:14] That's the OG that's the original is the OG oh yeah you like it is the OG
[01:23:18] I was never a tea drinker to be honest with you and but I was and I was surprised about how many like
[01:23:24] T-drinkers were like the brother chocolate. T is that's it's the legit one yeah
[01:23:28] Oh, yeah, you're just you you can get all this stuff

[01:23:44] Drinks here's the thing you see you mention energy from time to time. You know what energy is
[01:23:51] It's energy is an actual thing. Yeah, it's it's a hener graces got something
[01:23:55] It's hener graces charisma his whole oh that's his you know like yeah, you know when he talks he's like he's real brother
[01:24:01] That guy's on it man. Yeah, listen. They guy talk forever and that energy that he brings that's a
[01:24:07] Energy straight up. I thought it was like he made mix some food up, you know
[01:24:12] Maybe an Aussie bowl, but that was a energy one. I think the presentation of that yeah
[01:24:17] What's the energy so I'm just saying we got what we need to talk to the to hener then and get it you know
[01:24:22] Maybe he could approve of the energy drink over here
[01:24:26] What I think it's in the present it so I'm just saying it might be might be I don't know
[01:24:31] Maybe maybe not but it might be misleading to say hey they are considered henergie drinks you see I'm saying
[01:24:37] So okay, so this was not officially endorsed by hener
[01:24:42] Yes, okay, but if you want to get these drinks

[01:29:58] Some days I wake up thinking maybe they will so anyways we've built to platform that we can operate on with pure
[01:30:06] Independence and not have to rely on the current platforms that we're on we hope it doesn't come to that
[01:30:10] But if it does we would be foolish for us not to have a contingency plan if you want to help us with that
[01:30:14] You want to be a part of that go to jockel underground dot com because eight dollars and 18 cents a month

[01:30:51] It's um and the way I you know
[01:30:53] He like you go along with a certain thing and you could try to evaluate and maybe sum up like what is this?
[01:30:58] What is this right and you know you say Q&A which it is essentially but it's like it's kind of like when you go through life
[01:31:05] Whether be currently or before whatever
[01:31:08] I'm just saying you think about your past you think about the present
[01:31:11] Uh, this all these weird question what what but like this is a funny way of saying it
[01:31:16] You know me dear before
[01:31:20] It is true. It is true. Yeah, yeah, nonetheless you're still gonna have like
[01:31:24] Like you know how there's like questions rolling around like what does this what does this mean like what's my take on this?
[01:31:28] Not the end of the day, you know if you're the kind of ask ask that question to yourself
[01:31:33] I think you offer really good like you're take on it and it's usually really informed usually
[01:31:38] Um and it can kind of help a lot of us make sense out of certain elements of life, you know
[01:31:45] Whether be the specific questions that people ask or the first part that we talk about like you know
[01:31:50] Is our is our our children soft now, you know, it's society becoming soft or like you know
[01:31:57] So coming to the to the trick of advertising
[01:32:01] That can stuff like that's real stuff that we're dealing with like daily, you know
[01:32:04] Yeah, I think it brings awareness
[01:32:06] Yeah
[01:32:07] We talk about if I wanted to scare you
[01:32:10] But I told you hey, I'm gonna be in the house and I'm gonna scare you what are my chances of being able to scare you?
[01:32:16] Almost zero if you don't know
[01:32:21] And I would say I'm 99.9% gonna scare you
[01:32:28] So with life
[01:32:30] If you
[01:32:32] Have an opportunity to think through a problem or think through a question before you actually have to contend with it
[01:32:38] It's gonna make you
[01:32:39] unscarable yeah, so just that's as another I think that's the benefit of the jocconerground.com
