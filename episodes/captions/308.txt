[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number three.
[00:00:02] Oh, eight with echo Charles and me.
[00:00:05] Jockel, we're in good evening, echo.
[00:00:06] Good evening.
[00:00:07] So tonight at long last, we are going to wrap up what has ended up being a six part series.
[00:00:15] I got a little out of control, didn't I?
[00:00:18] Well, I kind of got a little out of control this one.
[00:00:22] Well, how not to do it cannot be overstated?
[00:00:25] How not to do it cannot be overstated?
[00:00:27] It's explained that.
[00:00:28] It means like if there are little tips how not to do something, let's face it.
[00:00:33] The value is what it call infinite.
[00:00:35] It's infinite.
[00:00:36] Check, good point.
[00:00:38] The book is called on the psychology of military competence.
[00:00:40] We started on 303, podcast 303, 304, 305, 306, 307.
[00:00:45] That's a lot of podcast.
[00:00:46] This is the winner.
[00:00:47] Most number of podcasts on a single book.
[00:00:52] If you haven't listened those, you can go back.
[00:00:53] I actually will say this in preparing this one.
[00:00:56] If you haven't listened those, you don't have to go back.
[00:00:58] You can listen to this one.
[00:01:00] There might be a couple of references, but they're not super, you'll be able to get through
[00:01:05] them.
[00:01:08] And this section that we're about to cover kind of starts with the crux of the book.
[00:01:11] But again, when I started reading this book a couple of years ago, it was a couple, maybe
[00:01:16] a year ago.
[00:01:17] Maybe a couple of years ago.
[00:01:18] I should have forget when I got this book.
[00:01:21] But I knew it was going to take a while, I didn't know it was going to take this long,
[00:01:27] but here we are.
[00:01:29] I apologize for taking so long.
[00:01:31] Like you said, though, when you understand how not to do something and you understand what
[00:01:41] the pitfalls are and the mistakes you can make and the traps.
[00:01:45] These things are all traps.
[00:01:46] They're all traps.
[00:01:47] And when you start to be able to see the traps, it helps a person a lot.
[00:01:53] It doesn't make them not going to the traps.
[00:01:56] That's the whole point.
[00:01:57] That's one of the whole points of this book is people know that this is a trap and they
[00:02:01] walk right into it.
[00:02:02] They just can't even help themselves.
[00:02:04] Like remember the whole name dropping thing that he talked about?
[00:02:06] I forget which one it was, but the name dropping, everybody knows it looks whack and
[00:02:11] they still do it.
[00:02:12] They can't control themselves.
[00:02:14] Well, let me rephrase that, an arrogant, egotistical person that's nervous about how they
[00:02:19] look.
[00:02:20] They're going to name drop even though they know it looks bad.
[00:02:23] Even though they'll point at someone else and say, oh, listen to Carrie name drop.
[00:02:26] They'll do that and then they'll name drop.
[00:02:29] They'll go, hey, see you.
[00:02:31] Carrie was name drop and over.
[00:02:32] You see him name dropping me.
[00:02:33] I was talking to Joe Rogan yesterday.
[00:02:35] You're not on saying it?
[00:02:38] That's how whack people are.
[00:02:40] That's how we get stuck in lame situations.
[00:02:44] So the crux of this book is actually the chapter we're going to start with right now.
[00:02:49] Dave Burke could make it by the way.
[00:02:51] It's good to work in busy.
[00:02:54] The chapter here is called authoritarianism and this is kind of the crux and this is
[00:03:02] this is what we need to watch out for.
[00:03:06] This is what we need to watch out for.
[00:03:08] This authoritarian mindset.
[00:03:10] Look, do you need to watch out for it as a nation?
[00:03:13] Yes, you better, especially as things start getting imposed on your life because that slides
[00:03:19] into authoritarianism.
[00:03:21] And that's a slippery slope.
[00:03:23] And I know you're going to bring up the slippery slope.
[00:03:25] Valicy.
[00:03:26] Well, I see you didn't your eyes.
[00:03:28] No, well, again, and I'll see that I said it before where there is such things as slippery
[00:03:32] slope.
[00:03:33] And there is such things as slippery slope.
[00:03:35] Valicy.
[00:03:36] They're not like one doesn't, you know.
[00:03:38] They both exist.
[00:03:39] They both exist exactly right.
[00:03:42] So authoritarianism in our minds, we have to watch out for it in our teams.
[00:03:48] As leaders, we have to watch out for it.
[00:03:49] And yes, as human beings living in a whatever country you live in, you need to watch out
[00:03:55] for that authoritarianism.
[00:03:56] Because it's a thing that once it starts to take hold, the authoritarian, it's no boss.
[00:04:03] Like, I get a little bit of control.
[00:04:05] A authoritarian people when they get a little bit of control, they want more control.
[00:04:08] And then they get a little bit more, they want even more.
[00:04:09] And they don't stop.
[00:04:11] It's a, it's a, it's a psychopathology that they have, that they can't contain it.
[00:04:20] So here we go.
[00:04:21] authoritarianism.
[00:04:22] In discussing military organizations, it was suggested that a symbiotic relationship
[00:04:26] exists between certain characteristics of armed services and the private needs of the individual
[00:04:31] members.
[00:04:32] So what that's saying is, when you go on the military, there's certain needs that certain
[00:04:36] people have, certain psychological needs that people have.
[00:04:40] But going in the military satisfies those needs.
[00:04:43] For instance, here's an example of where this is a bad thing.
[00:04:46] I like to rule over people.
[00:04:49] I know if I be coming off during the military, I'll be able to rule over those privates.
[00:04:55] So it sort of satisfies that to me.
[00:05:01] So there's a nice relationship I have.
[00:05:02] I want to be an authoritarian.
[00:05:04] This puts me into an authoritarian position.
[00:05:06] I love it.
[00:05:07] Is this true of all military people?
[00:05:09] No, it's not.
[00:05:10] Continue on emphasis was laid upon the central role in this relationship of anxiety that
[00:05:15] incidious motivator of such, of much human behavior.
[00:05:18] In the military mind, it was pointed out anxiety has many sources.
[00:05:23] Fear of death and mutilation, fear of suppression, fear of failure and social disapproval,
[00:05:29] fear of public disgrace and underlying all that fear of total disorder, which is in separable
[00:05:36] product of unleashing normally tabooed instinctual forces.
[00:05:41] So if you're a person that doesn't like disorder, you look at the military and go,
[00:05:46] huh?
[00:05:47] That looks pretty good.
[00:05:48] You gotta go to bed at a certain time.
[00:05:49] All these people will listen to me.
[00:05:50] We get to follow orders.
[00:05:51] They're going to tell me what to do.
[00:05:52] Everyone's going to listen to when I tell them what to do.
[00:05:55] That's you, you're a, if you don't like disorder, that's a great place to be.
[00:05:59] Until what happens, the layer of total disorder on planet earth opens its jaws and that
[00:06:08] is combat.
[00:06:10] So now you're a person that doesn't like disorder and for your job at the moment of truth,
[00:06:15] you are thrust into the jaws of the highest level of disorder in the world.
[00:06:20] That is combat.
[00:06:22] And that's why this is, that's what this book is about.
[00:06:25] This psychology of military incompetence is because people that like order.
[00:06:29] They join the military because they like order.
[00:06:31] And then they're actual job.
[00:06:33] Look, part of their job is marching around a parade field and inspecting uniforms and keeping
[00:06:37] everything square away.
[00:06:38] That's great.
[00:06:39] But when that, when that homey shows up and shit's getting crazy, they lose their minds.
[00:06:46] So when you're looking, when you're judging and you're thinking, I want to find that
[00:06:50] bad guy be a good military officer.
[00:06:51] They're highly disciplined.
[00:06:54] They're highly disciplined.
[00:06:55] They, they, they, they follow orders.
[00:06:57] They're a foritary and they seem like they be great.
[00:06:59] You need to remember what's that person going to do when things get wild and they're
[00:07:04] going to get wild.
[00:07:07] Continuing on, finally it was suggested.
[00:07:09] And you can see where this whole book, that little, that, that crocks.
[00:07:14] That's why I said this is the crux of the book.
[00:07:15] That crux right there is why this is so fascinating to me because I've seen this throughout
[00:07:20] my career.
[00:07:21] People that were square away, people that were highly disciplined, people that were
[00:07:26] loved for things to be in order and when things weren't going right or things were getting
[00:07:30] wild, they'd lose their minds.
[00:07:33] And by the way, if they never got put into a situation where things got wild, they get
[00:07:37] promoted by the way.
[00:07:39] They're getting promoted because they're the most ordered.
[00:07:42] They kept the tightest reins on their troops.
[00:07:47] Back to the book, finally it was suggested that a special predisposition toward these several
[00:07:51] sorts of anxiety may be present some people as a result of their early childhood.
[00:07:55] Again, this is where, and somebody pointed this out to me on one of the YouTube comments,
[00:07:59] the word I was looking for was psychobabble.
[00:08:03] Psychobabble.
[00:08:04] Because again, this guy was a psychologist, so he ties all the stuff into weird Freudian
[00:08:08] freaking childhood experiences.
[00:08:10] And I can't back any that up.
[00:08:12] I don't know about any of that.
[00:08:14] What I do know is this, people have different personalities.
[00:08:17] Where those personalities came from, I don't really know, and I actually don't care.
[00:08:20] You show up to a seal team.
[00:08:22] Your personality is that whatever your personality is, and that's great.
[00:08:27] That's fine.
[00:08:29] I don't care where it came from.
[00:08:30] If you're hyper-ordered and you can't stand it when things get wild, you're not going
[00:08:34] to be a good seal officer or a good seal leader.
[00:08:38] If you're totally rebellious and you can't fall in the line ever, well that's too far
[00:08:44] in the other direction, and now you can't control anything, you can't control yourself.
[00:08:48] So we want to find some of that balances that dichotomy, but whether it comes from early childhood
[00:08:54] in the way you were potty trained in all these kinds of psychobabble, I don't know.
[00:08:58] I don't know.
[00:08:59] We'll have to ask Jordan B. Peter's a name drop about that one.
[00:09:04] Such people may well be drawn towards military organizations because the latter have
[00:09:08] of necessity, perfected devices like bullshit, discipline, and hierarchical command structures
[00:09:14] and rigid conventions, which not only allow aggression without anxiety, but also reduce
[00:09:20] anxiety that may have originated much earlier period of life.
[00:09:23] Again, a little bit, a little bit psychoanalysis too much for me.
[00:09:28] It's sort of, it's a bummer because as I've said many times, Jordan Peterson may be
[00:09:32] starting to like think maybe psychology was sort of a real thing.
[00:09:36] This is kind of dropping back in the back.
[00:09:38] Sorry, psychology.
[00:09:41] Somebody who put somebody who went, I was reading YouTube notes, no comments.
[00:09:47] And somebody was telling me that, you know, what much of what Freud said was actually right,
[00:09:51] but he's just been so like hammered by his reputation because he was a cocaine fiend.
[00:10:00] And now we kind of dis dis dis disperse or dispatch everything that he said.
[00:10:04] So maybe I was a little hard on him.
[00:10:06] I don't know.
[00:10:07] As far as I'm concerned, if you're doing a lot of cocaine like that and you're prescribing
[00:10:10] it to a bunch of people and you're lying about who's getting cured, I kind of take a lot of
[00:10:15] what you said and thrown out the window.
[00:10:17] Yeah, well, what's that?
[00:10:19] There's a bias too, right?
[00:10:21] The cocaine addiction.
[00:10:23] I don't know.
[00:10:24] Yes, that's my bias.
[00:10:25] I'm biased against people that are addicted to cocaine.
[00:10:27] No, it's not a bias.
[00:10:28] It's a logical fallacy.
[00:10:29] I don't know if you're you're committing this logical fallacy, but it's the, I forget
[00:10:36] what it is.
[00:10:37] The example is like, oh, why would you listen to Fred?
[00:10:41] Fred doesn't even have a job.
[00:10:43] So it's kind of like, okay, it's like, I think I am committing this.
[00:10:46] It's like, you kind of like, why would you listen to Freud?
[00:10:48] I know Freud's addicted to cocaine.
[00:10:50] Yeah, I'm lying to people.
[00:10:51] I'm not saying you're making the bad decision and I'm like that.
[00:10:55] I'm saying from a logical standpoint, it's technically a fallacy.
[00:10:59] It's like, okay, that means if you do cocaine, everything else you say is incorrect.
[00:11:02] Is that what that means?
[00:11:03] Yeah.
[00:11:04] For a logical standpoint.
[00:11:05] You're right.
[00:11:06] Well, I'll concede that per, well, that's what I am continuing.
[00:11:11] Okay.
[00:11:12] Freud was right part of the time.
[00:11:13] Give Freud his part on some of the stuff.
[00:11:16] As you was, you know, just not a, in light of all this, it is encouraging to encounter
[00:11:22] a substantial body of research, which not only provides support for the thesis, but also
[00:11:26] fills in many of the gaps.
[00:11:29] It is that on the authoritarian personality and then they get into this massive section
[00:11:34] about the authoritarian personality, which I'm not comfortable with because I've already spent
[00:11:37] six freaking podcasts on this book, which is all good.
[00:11:40] But I'm going to do a little bit of it for the impetus behind the study of authoritarianism.
[00:11:44] We have to think the founders and proponents of the third Reich, they, it who was presented
[00:11:53] to the world, a phenomenon, the like of which has never been seen before, since the
[00:11:58] systematic bureaucratized murder of six million Jews to the inquiring mind anti-Semitism
[00:12:05] on the scale would seem to demand at the very least some explanation for group of researchers
[00:12:09] at Frankfurt and later at Berkeley, California, the fact that human prejudice could assume
[00:12:15] such monstrous proportion suggested the possibility of a particular personality type being
[00:12:21] implicated in the perpetration of these dark events.
[00:12:23] So basically he's saying, look, the Nazis were psycho, where did their personality come from,
[00:12:33] what type of people had that personality?
[00:12:35] And then he goes into a Nazi psychologist whose name was Jinch, something like that,
[00:12:42] Jinch, I don't know, sorry, they're Nazi bastards from mispronouncing your name.
[00:12:48] So he broke it down and there was S types at the high end could have something called
[00:12:58] Syncysia, have you ever heard of Syncysia before?
[00:13:01] Syncysia, this is a very interesting story.
[00:13:04] So Syncysia, Seston, he was could memorize any number immediately.
[00:13:11] So if he met like a female in a bar, he would say what's your number and they would
[00:13:16] say it and he would immediately know it.
[00:13:20] And then he was really good at weird math problems and he could memorize dates.
[00:13:26] And one day we were talking because it was notistable enough, how good he was at it,
[00:13:35] that you think to yourself, there's something a little different, that's really weird how
[00:13:38] he could memorize this stuff.
[00:13:40] So he said to me one day he goes, you know, this is kind of weird, but when I see numbers,
[00:13:47] I don't see a number, I see a color and it has like a texture to it.
[00:13:53] And I was like, okay, bro, if we were to the military, I'd think you were maybe on
[00:13:59] something.
[00:14:00] So LSD or whatever.
[00:14:03] So he, I said, what do you mean?
[00:14:04] He says, well, for me, and then he described the colors of each, the colors and textures
[00:14:10] of each number.
[00:14:13] So the only one I remember was that zero was like hollow.
[00:14:18] He said he said zero was hollow.
[00:14:20] It's not, it's like it's not there.
[00:14:24] One was white.
[00:14:27] And the other one I remember is seven was yellow.
[00:14:31] And the reason I remembered that one was because I have two sevens in my phone number and
[00:14:34] when the first time I asked him what I said, say my phone number in colors and he was
[00:14:37] like, you know, yellow, yellow, but a blue.
[00:14:39] And yellow, yellow and I have two sevens.
[00:14:41] And I said, what's, I go seven, yellow because yeah.
[00:14:45] So it was just weird.
[00:14:46] He had no idea why this was the situation.
[00:14:49] So one day I'm in a bookstore and this is kind of early in the day when you would
[00:14:56] just go on a website to buy your books.
[00:14:59] I'm in a bookstore and I see numbers on a cover of a book and they're all colored and
[00:15:07] textured and I was, I was, that's weird.
[00:15:10] And I walk over and I pick it up and I start looking through it and it says, oh, this book is
[00:15:14] about a person that had Sanisticia.
[00:15:18] And so it, so I look it up.
[00:15:20] Sanisticia is a thing where you have multiple, multiple modes of interpreting information.
[00:15:34] So for instance, numbers have colors.
[00:15:37] They can have letters, can have colors.
[00:15:40] But that's the way, that's the way Seth fought.
[00:15:45] And so for this Nazi, the change, that was kind of the far end of this kind of wild, creative
[00:15:53] thing.
[00:15:54] This kind of wild, creative person here, it says, to have subjective experiences in one
[00:16:00] modality when receiving stimulation in another.
[00:16:02] This is the kind of wildest brain that you can get.
[00:16:05] And so this Nazi guy, this is the S type.
[00:16:08] These are people that are S types.
[00:16:10] It doesn't mean they necessarily have Sanisticia, but they're leaning in that direction.
[00:16:14] And this quote has the liberal in his views, eccentric behavior, also weak, a feminine
[00:16:20] and prone to a radical belief that people are largely shaped by their environment and education.
[00:16:25] Again, this is from an Nazi psychologist, which, if we're not listening to Freud, we're
[00:16:31] not listening to this Nazi dude.
[00:16:33] So but he's breaking it down in two types, the S type.
[00:16:36] And then the other type is the J type.
[00:16:39] And according to this guy, the J type were quote, good types that would make good Nazis
[00:16:49] amongst their sterling qualities, where purity and perception and the sure knowledge that
[00:16:55] human behavior is determined by blood, soil, and national tradition.
[00:16:59] The hence freaking Nazis, the J type, so the Nazi type would be a he-man hard and tough
[00:17:07] a man you could rely on.
[00:17:10] These qualities would he said have been handed down by a long line of North German ancestors.
[00:17:17] So this is what the Nazi says.
[00:17:20] And it's just, it's kind of funny because, well, Sstone was about as hard of a bastard
[00:17:26] as you could ever know.
[00:17:27] And a certain be a he-man, a divisible as well.
[00:17:30] And a warrior, a big freaking Viking warrior, a Texas mom, the other day, I was like, yeah,
[00:17:35] thanks for letting me hang out with that freaking savage, Viking kid of yours.
[00:17:42] So now we go to the Berkeley study.
[00:17:45] So we just did the Nazi study who got these two different types, the S type, which is sort
[00:17:49] of a liberal sort of a feminine type, and then the J type, which is more of the conservative
[00:17:55] hardcore type.
[00:17:57] And the American researchers later, going back to the book, also found two contrasting
[00:18:03] personality types, and these were very like those described by change.
[00:18:08] Needless to say, they evaluated them rather differently, the one that corresponded to the
[00:18:12] J type, they called the authoritarian personality.
[00:18:16] Such a person was anti-Semitic, rigid, intolerant of ambiguity.
[00:18:20] I can't think about this.
[00:18:22] If you're intolerant of ambiguity, think of how you're in a performing combat.
[00:18:25] You're going to be great in the military, in the in the in the in the rear of the military,
[00:18:31] because you're you don't like ambiguity, as soon as you're in combat, you don't know exactly
[00:18:34] know what's happening.
[00:18:35] You got to make it as soon as you're going to hate it.
[00:18:39] So intolerant of ambiguity and hostile to people or groups racially different from himself
[00:18:48] by the same token of the polar opposite to this type, change, contemptible, anti-type was
[00:18:54] individualistic, tolerant, democratic, unpredgidists, and egalitarian.
[00:19:02] So you've got these two different personalities.
[00:19:06] The Nazis called the bad one good.
[00:19:08] And the Berkeley people called the good one bad.
[00:19:11] So you get, however you want to break that down.
[00:19:15] Their test provided measures of anti-Semitism, ethnocentrism, political and economic
[00:19:20] conservatism, and implicit anti-democratic trends or potentiality for fascism, which
[00:19:28] they called the F scale.
[00:19:30] Like what is your potential of becoming a fascist?
[00:19:34] This much of which is based on by actual utterances by the Nazis measured in individuals
[00:19:38] predisposition towards.
[00:19:40] So this is what the F type.
[00:19:41] If you have a tendency where you can become a fascist, conventionalism, ie rigid adherence
[00:19:47] to conventional middle-class values.
[00:19:50] A foritarian submission.
[00:19:53] A submissive uncritical attitude toward the idealized moral authorities of the group,
[00:20:00] which he identifies himself.
[00:20:01] And that's what's kind of crazy, right?
[00:20:04] You would think that a foritarians would be hard to control.
[00:20:08] But if you're part of that group, they're in the game.
[00:20:12] So that's why I like the young officer in the military that he's totally down.
[00:20:17] He's saluting without most vigor because he's part of that system.
[00:20:22] And he's on board.
[00:20:23] He's submissive to the system.
[00:20:27] A foritarian aggression, ie, a tendency to be on the lookout for and to condemn reject
[00:20:33] and punish people who violate conventional values.
[00:20:37] It's kind of weird how there's like right now.
[00:20:40] You've got antifa who's supposed to be sort of like the wild antifascist who's actually
[00:20:46] totally on board with what I'm saying right now as they're off the charts on the F scale.
[00:20:51] Yeah, so like this, I don't know if this S F scale would reflect this specifically or accurately.
[00:20:57] But essentially, like two sides, right?
[00:21:01] One is real conventional, right?
[00:21:03] They're probably probably, I don't know, but they're probably going to ignore exceptions.
[00:21:07] You know, the value of exceptions and the nuance and all this stuff, right?
[00:21:10] They're going to tend to ignore it, right?
[00:21:12] Then you have the other side who probably overvalue nuance and exceptions.
[00:21:17] Kind of like, hey, if there's these exceptions, that must be just as equal as the rule.
[00:21:23] Because you know, you kind of look at the individual, you know?
[00:21:25] So that antifa analogy is absolutely correct.
[00:21:29] They're doing an exact same thing.
[00:21:31] They're just reversed.
[00:21:32] Yeah, you got to kind of, I don't know, back in the day, it seems like everyone was way
[00:21:37] more just in the middle.
[00:21:38] Well, balance is what we lose.
[00:21:41] What you want, even on these two things, do you want to be a fascist?
[00:21:44] No, but do you want to be crazy uncontrollable?
[00:21:48] No, you want to be balanced.
[00:21:49] Yeah.
[00:21:50] Yeah.
[00:21:51] And even just valuing like the group and then on the other hand, valuing the individual,
[00:21:57] it's like you got to value both of those things.
[00:21:59] I think about those things.
[00:22:00] 100%.
[00:22:01] Yeah.
[00:22:02] 100%.
[00:22:03] Next one, anti-interception.
[00:22:07] IE opposition to the subjective, the imaginative, and the tender-minded superstition and
[00:22:16] stereotype power and toughness preoccupation with the dominant submission, strong, weak,
[00:22:23] leader, follower, dimension, identification with power figures, overemphasis on conventional
[00:22:28] attributes of the ego, exaggeration, exaggerated, exaggerated assertion of strength and toughness.
[00:22:35] So how much of that is important?
[00:22:37] You know, that's putting you out there on that F scale a little bit.
[00:22:39] I'm starting to drift, man.
[00:22:41] Start to drift.
[00:22:43] Destructiveness and cynicism.
[00:22:46] Generalized hostility, vilification of the human.
[00:22:49] So obviously, a lot of this was focused around, hey, the Nazis and where the Nazis came from,
[00:22:55] part of that F thing is they can look at humans and be like whatever they don't matter.
[00:23:01] Projectivity, the belief that wild and dangerous things go on in the world, the projection
[00:23:06] outwards of unconscious emotional impulses, pure, atanical and exaggerated concern with
[00:23:14] sexual goings on.
[00:23:20] So you got these two personality types.
[00:23:25] Another little note here, these torturous machinations of the authority of the authoritarian
[00:23:30] mind, ramify yet further.
[00:23:32] As he has to deny his own shortcomings, he dare not look inward.
[00:23:37] He is fearful of insight and strenuously avoids questioning his own motives.
[00:23:42] Again, this is when people are, they're not real confident with themselves, so they project
[00:23:48] and look at everyone else.
[00:23:51] Similarly, the authoritarian personality is intolerant of ambivalence and ambiguity.
[00:23:56] We already hit that.
[00:23:57] Not as he cannot harbor negative and positive feelings for the same person, but must dichotomize
[00:24:03] reality into loved people versus hated people.
[00:24:09] So that's a very, that's restating what you said, because someone, what should you be able
[00:24:16] to do?
[00:24:17] You should be able to look at echo and be like, you know what, I like that echo, he's
[00:24:21] pretty nice, but also he can get a little bit lazy sometimes, but overall, you know,
[00:24:27] we're good.
[00:24:28] Cryptic messages, whatever.
[00:24:32] Right, but if I say echo is nice, but freaking easily easy, I can't stand him, right?
[00:24:37] And then you can start looking from one individual to look to a whole group of people,
[00:24:41] as you said, and start looking at a group of people and just saying, well, that group
[00:24:45] of people is bad.
[00:24:46] Did I just do that with Antifa?
[00:24:49] I just kind of, sorry, you implied it.
[00:24:51] I'm sorry, Antifa.
[00:24:52] I need a little bit more over-minded to your individuals.
[00:24:57] Yeah, they're one of those groups that they're, they're, they're current public facing
[00:25:02] persona, not that hard.
[00:25:08] There's another nine-year research that took place published a decade after the Berkeley
[00:25:14] Research, and this is something that I've been focused on a lot, and it's the open and
[00:25:22] closed mind centered on the problem of an individual's capacity to absorb fresh information,
[00:25:29] humanity it seems, varies considerably in this respect.
[00:25:33] And God, that is true.
[00:25:35] So this guy, his name is Rokech, Rockych, something like this, and he did this study,
[00:25:40] started breaking down, they're open in the close mind.
[00:25:42] Some people have open minds, some people have closed minds.
[00:25:44] And I actually think that this is even, kind of, trumps the F, what was it?
[00:25:50] The F scale.
[00:25:51] I think this trumps the F scale.
[00:25:53] How much can someone's mind open, how much can it close?
[00:25:57] And I've been talking a lot about this from a leadership perspective, because it is,
[00:26:04] to me, what we have to fight all the time.
[00:26:07] Our minds are constantly trying to close and be defensive and take care of themselves
[00:26:11] and not allow any other ideas in and what we have to do as people and as leaders is constantly
[00:26:15] pull your mind open, constantly except other people's ideas.
[00:26:18] It doesn't mean you have to think that the right, but you have to listen to them and assess
[00:26:21] them in an honest way.
[00:26:23] And what we have been doing a lot of, as a society, is just closing our minds to everyone else's
[00:26:28] ideas.
[00:26:29] And we don't want to hear what their perspective is, because we think we're right.
[00:26:31] And if you do that as a leader, you come to me with a viewpoint on my plan.
[00:26:36] And I don't open my mind to your viewpoint, I'm wrong.
[00:26:42] Goes on here.
[00:26:43] Humanity it seems, varies considerably in this respect.
[00:26:44] At the one extreme, our open minds, ready and willing to entertain new facts even if they
[00:26:48] are incompatible with their previously held attitudes and beliefs.
[00:26:52] That's what we want.
[00:26:53] You've got to open your mind and go, hey, you know what?
[00:26:55] I really expect to see those numbers or get that feedback, but there it is.
[00:26:59] And I need to put that in my calculus.
[00:27:03] The other, at the other end of the scale, are closed minds, which, as their name suggests,
[00:27:09] is a resultally resist taking in anything that conflicts with their preconceptions and treasured
[00:27:14] beliefs, not very surprisingly the possession of a closed mind turned out to be yet another
[00:27:19] aspect of the authoritarian personality.
[00:27:26] Is that, okay, so you can always make it like an analogy to wait lifting for some reason.
[00:27:31] No, you can.
[00:27:32] But I'm open to it.
[00:27:33] That's your way to go.
[00:27:35] Like I wonder if that's like a laser, you know, by nature, like the human body and brain
[00:27:40] is kind of late for lack of better term in slaves.
[00:27:42] It's conserving energy all the time, you know?
[00:27:45] So even like lifting weights, when you lift weights, your body's response to lifting weights
[00:27:50] is just a lazy, laziness mechanism.
[00:27:52] So the body is basically saying, oh, shoot, that was kind of hard.
[00:27:55] What do we got to do at home?
[00:27:57] Tell me in the body to make it a little bit easier next time.
[00:27:59] And then it adapts and gets bigger and stronger, whatever.
[00:28:02] So kind of like a weird, like I said, laziness, lack of better term mechanism.
[00:28:07] So like when you have a close mind, it's kind of like, hey, I already learned that.
[00:28:10] Like, give me some more stuff.
[00:28:11] I got to learn.
[00:28:12] You know, kind of thing.
[00:28:13] So then it's easier.
[00:28:14] Like because it's all mental, it's not physical.
[00:28:15] So you just kind of resist against it.
[00:28:18] And you can see where this ties into everything that I have talked about from a leadership
[00:28:24] perspective for my entire life, which is humility.
[00:28:29] Because if your humble, your mind is open, if your arrogant, your mind is closed, you
[00:28:33] think you know everything.
[00:28:34] You don't need to hear anything else.
[00:28:35] You're not going to make any adaptations.
[00:28:36] Yeah, when you see that little system that kind of makes sense.
[00:28:39] It makes so much sense.
[00:28:40] Right, especially go back to the weightlifting.
[00:28:42] Like you give your body some definitely go back to the left.
[00:28:44] That's only a workout.
[00:28:45] Right, the next day, you get that domes.
[00:28:47] Right, you don't like that stuff.
[00:28:49] Like I remember when I was little, I do some pushups, thinking I'm all cool, whatever,
[00:28:52] do some of the next day.
[00:28:53] I'm like, so I didn't know about domes that much.
[00:28:55] And bro, that's a terrible feeling.
[00:28:57] So super, I'm not doing that anymore.
[00:28:59] Or at the very least, the inside of my body, my body is like, okay, we got to do something
[00:29:02] easier or make it so it's easier next time that happens.
[00:29:06] So from a mental standpoint, it makes sense.
[00:29:09] Where Brad, what do you call it?
[00:29:11] The fucking you call, you talk to about it last.
[00:29:13] The cognitive dissidence or whatever.
[00:29:16] That is domes for your mind, essentially.
[00:29:18] Or maybe the precursor to the, I don't know, it's one of those things.
[00:29:22] I'm just saying it makes sense.
[00:29:23] Is that hurts?
[00:29:24] You know, when you get that new stuff.
[00:29:26] I don't want that new stuff.
[00:29:27] I'm good with this old stuff.
[00:29:28] Close mind.
[00:29:29] Yeah.
[00:29:31] He says here, before leaving this section on a foritarianism, there are several other research
[00:29:35] findings which are pertinent to our present thesis.
[00:29:37] One of these shows the relationship between conformity, a foritarianism, and the tendency
[00:29:42] to yield to group pressures.
[00:29:44] An extreme example of this pattern is the phenomenon of the participation in a lynch mob,
[00:29:50] where the naturally conformist individual happily yields to group pressure for the
[00:29:56] perpetration of a criminally aggressive act, which the holy at variance with the ethos
[00:30:02] of the wider society accords with his own narrow self-interest.
[00:30:08] So again, it's a, it's a, it's counterintuitive to think that someone that's a foritarian
[00:30:16] is going to be more apt to go with the group.
[00:30:21] Another finding concerns the effect of authoritarianism upon problem solving in a group
[00:30:25] situation.
[00:30:26] Oh, I love this one because again, I'm thinking of it from a military perspective and
[00:30:30] you start thinking, now you got this authoritarian in command how are they at problem solving?
[00:30:36] Well, let's go to the book from their research.
[00:30:40] W. H. Thorn in his colleagues concluded this, that, Equalitarian subjects, I.e. those
[00:30:47] low on authoritarianism were apparently more effective in dealing with a task in problem
[00:30:52] than were authoritarian.
[00:30:55] So that open mind is way better for problem solving.
[00:30:57] Seems obvious, but this was reflected in higher ratings of effective intelligence, leadership
[00:31:03] and goal-striving on the sorts of leaders who emerged in the group situation.
[00:31:08] They had this to say, emergent leaders in the low F groups were more sensitive to others,
[00:31:16] more effective leaders, more prone to making suggestions for action subject to group
[00:31:21] sanction and less likely to give direct orders to others.
[00:31:26] This is insane how much this matches everything I've been talking about.
[00:31:32] A conclusion incidentally, which accords with the observation that authoritarianists are less
[00:31:38] able to appreciate the effect they have upon others and may well think themselves more
[00:31:43] like to popular than they really are.
[00:31:47] I'm chuckling as I think of my military career and people that thought that they were super
[00:31:51] popular and everyone who you do.
[00:31:54] Even people attracted to a career in an authoritarian organization.
[00:32:00] I.e. the military have been found to prefer leaders who score low on a, on a, on
[00:32:09] test of authoritarianism, presumably because of authoritarianists are less sensitive to
[00:32:13] the needs of other.
[00:32:14] Even when you're a, when you're kind of authoritarian yourself and you joined the
[00:32:18] military, when you get asked about what type of leader you like, guess what?
[00:32:22] You actually like less authoritarian leaders because they listen, they treat you with respect,
[00:32:27] their minds are open.
[00:32:29] So this is the best way to lead across the board.
[00:32:32] You know, skyscrapers here in San Diego, California, I'm sure it's like this ever.
[00:32:37] I'm not an engineer.
[00:32:38] You know that.
[00:32:41] From what I understand, okay, so think of a tall building, right?
[00:32:45] It's talk.
[00:32:46] So that thing better be strong, right?
[00:32:48] Hold itself up.
[00:32:51] But tall buildings aren't made rigidly.
[00:32:53] They're made with a little bit of flims, slim ziness on purpose.
[00:32:57] Tubzor, like movement.
[00:32:59] The various movements and vibrations that may or may not come about.
[00:33:02] So it's essentially the same thing.
[00:33:04] On the surface, you think, well, yeah, authoritarianism.
[00:33:06] That's the way you can't destroy it.
[00:33:08] You can't break it or nothing like that, but rather it's not how it works.
[00:33:12] If you're too rigid, right, you're just going to crumble when the wiggle start coming.
[00:33:16] When the earthquake starts coming, you know?
[00:33:18] Again, this is why humility is the most important aspect or characteristic for a leader.
[00:33:23] Because when you're humble, you're able to move a little bit.
[00:33:26] You're able to take on new ideas.
[00:33:28] You're able to sway when the earthquake comes and they're adjustments.
[00:33:32] You're not just crumbling and falling down.
[00:33:36] It cannot be stressed too strongly that in talking about authoritarianism, we have been
[00:33:40] discussing people towards one end of a continuum.
[00:33:43] This is important because this is a dichotomy.
[00:33:46] This guy couldn't quite put that.
[00:33:48] He couldn't grasp that concept like you're boy, right here.
[00:33:50] Yes, sir.
[00:33:52] Between, because you had a balance at dichotomy, but here's what he says, between this
[00:33:56] and the other can be found people with all shades of opinion on the various attitudes measured.
[00:34:01] The general point is this, when discussing a authoritarianism, no value judgment is intended.
[00:34:06] Few would dispute that in moderation, many of the traits which make up the authoritarian
[00:34:11] personality have value in society.
[00:34:14] Civilization requires that there be some repression of sex and aggression, some exercise
[00:34:19] of discipline and a modicum of conformity and ordinalliness.
[00:34:24] So there's aspects of that personality which are good and that's true in the military.
[00:34:28] In fact, the military got a little bit extra.
[00:34:31] Because you got to be a little bit more conformist because you got to get the teet-you
[00:34:34] know you got to be on board, but it attracts people that are too much.
[00:34:38] Yeah.
[00:34:38] A little bit fast forward here.
[00:34:43] In other respects, however, likelihood of above average levels of authoritarianism in military
[00:34:48] personnel may well contribute toward incompetence, particularly when the authoritarian
[00:34:53] has reached a level of command where flexibility and an open mind are mandatory for success
[00:34:59] to be more specific the personality traits of authoritarianism and the associated characteristics
[00:35:05] of the closed mind and obsessive character may contribute to incompetence in the following
[00:35:10] ways.
[00:35:11] One, since authoritarianism has been found to be more dishonest, more irresponsible, more
[00:35:18] untrustworthy, more socially conforming, more suspicious than non-authoritarians, they are unlikely
[00:35:25] to make successful social leaders.
[00:35:29] A foretarians will be less likely to understand enemy intentions.
[00:35:33] I never thought of that before.
[00:35:34] Actually, here's something new for Jocco.
[00:35:36] If you're a foretarian, you're less likely to understand what the enemy is doing because
[00:35:40] you can't even understand their perspective.
[00:35:43] And to act upon information regarding such intentions as conflict with the beliefs and preconceptions
[00:35:49] which the commander might hold.
[00:35:53] Makes sense.
[00:35:54] Okay, forgive me for all the analogies by the way, I'm just reading the comments.
[00:36:00] Now this time is cameras.
[00:36:01] Or for whatever, I need to do for two.
[00:36:04] They were accurate.
[00:36:05] The person who is different among people.
[00:36:10] We'll consider a camera, or a photograph, or whatever.
[00:36:13] You have high resolution, low resolution, kind of the situation.
[00:36:16] The authoritarianism seems like a low resolution scenario.
[00:36:20] Way more black and white, way more like, oh yeah, like freaking either.
[00:36:23] It's this way.
[00:36:24] And if it's not this way, then it's obviously the other way.
[00:36:27] But you get a high-res photo.
[00:36:28] It's like, oh, that's just black.
[00:36:30] Obviously, no, no, just look closer.
[00:36:33] It's kind of great.
[00:36:34] It's actually pretty dark gray.
[00:36:35] And then even within that gray, this darker and lighter shades of gray.
[00:36:38] Or is it called?
[00:36:39] Or, oh, well, colors.
[00:36:41] What, yeah, whatever.
[00:36:42] This one might be orange.
[00:36:43] This one might be salmon.
[00:36:46] Which is a color.
[00:36:47] Yeah.
[00:36:48] Egg shill.
[00:36:49] With a Romalean type.
[00:36:51] By the way, what's that from?
[00:36:53] I can't say.
[00:36:54] No, no, no, but see what I'm saying though, where you get a low-res situation.
[00:36:59] Yeah.
[00:37:00] Yeah, they don't get it.
[00:37:01] They don't know.
[00:37:02] And then you said, what they don't know what the enemies thinking.
[00:37:03] Yeah, because they see black.
[00:37:05] But the enemies not on black.
[00:37:06] They're over here on 38% great.
[00:37:09] Yeah, exactly right.
[00:37:10] So yeah, that's just the way it's working.
[00:37:12] It's soon saying.
[00:37:13] So you got to be, oh, I'm not saying you got to be.
[00:37:14] I'm just saying it might be as the book is demonstrating more efficient.
[00:37:19] Effective to have a more nuanced perception of what's happened.
[00:37:22] Some higher as to experience.
[00:37:25] In 1954, American research showed that people with a high score on tests of a foretarianism
[00:37:31] had greater difficulty than non-foritarians in recognizing threatening messages when these
[00:37:38] were presented visually.
[00:37:40] A year later, another study confirmed this finding with threatening words that were heard
[00:37:45] instead of seen.
[00:37:47] So someone that's a foretarian.
[00:37:48] They don't even, they just don't comprehend the world accurately.
[00:37:51] Look, that is now your metaphor just became more ample in that right there.
[00:38:00] They can't see as well.
[00:38:02] They can't see as clear.
[00:38:03] They can't see the nuance.
[00:38:04] They can't see the message.
[00:38:07] Three, the inability to sacrifice cherished traditions and accept technical innovations, the
[00:38:11] history of the machine gun, the tank, and the aeroplane contained striking as an evidence
[00:38:15] of this disability.
[00:38:17] In war, an ounce of calculation is worth a ton of intuition.
[00:38:20] It also saves many lives.
[00:38:21] Number four, the under estimation of enemy ability.
[00:38:26] Number five, and he's got whole sections about each one of these.
[00:38:28] That's where you got to buy the book.
[00:38:30] Number five, an emphasis upon the importance of blind obedience and loyalty at the expense
[00:38:35] of initiative and innovation at lower levels of command.
[00:38:39] So that's just, if you lose that.
[00:38:43] So if you're in charge of the company of soldiers and your focus is on getting them to
[00:38:49] be blindly obedient because you're an authoritarian, it's bad.
[00:38:54] And you're doing it at the expense of having decentralized command.
[00:38:58] Watch out for that.
[00:39:01] Got to beware.
[00:39:03] Number six, the protection of the reputations of senior commanders and punishment of those
[00:39:08] in the lower military hierarchy if they voice any opinion.
[00:39:12] Whoever valuable in itself implies criticism of those higher up.
[00:39:15] So they don't want to hear any pushback on anything, which is again, a start contrast
[00:39:21] to what I encourage all the time.
[00:39:23] Up and down the chain of command, I want pushed back from my team.
[00:39:27] My team isn't pushing back, actually.
[00:39:29] I'm nervous.
[00:39:31] Now I think I've got blind obedience, which I don't want.
[00:39:36] Number seven, close.
[00:39:37] We were related to the foregoing effects of authoritarianism is an individual's propensity
[00:39:41] to blame others for their own shortcomings.
[00:39:48] This is the opposite of extreme ownership.
[00:39:49] So the opposite of extreme ownership is authoritarian and blaming other people.
[00:39:56] When it's soccer if I was reading this book, right now, and it just wasn't working.
[00:39:59] It was all not massive enough.
[00:40:05] All my theories were wrong.
[00:40:08] For eight, the close relationship between authoritarianism and obsessive traits has also
[00:40:13] played a significant part of military incompetence.
[00:40:15] This is a matter which we discussed earlier.
[00:40:17] Suffice it to say that the worst excesses of bull and the clinging to an across-dick ritual
[00:40:25] have played not a not inconsiderable part in holding back the military machine.
[00:40:32] So when you are hyper-obsessed OCD on little things that don't matter, this is not going
[00:40:39] to help you.
[00:40:41] Number nine, there's one trait of the authoritarian personality which at first sight may
[00:40:44] seem to have nothing to do with military incompetence, a belief in supernatural forces.
[00:40:51] The contrary is in fact the case.
[00:40:53] As a general issue, since military decision should not be based upon a proper weighing
[00:40:57] up of facts, the introduction of metaphysical variables into decision-making necessarily contributes
[00:41:03] noise which decreases the probability of decisions being correct.
[00:41:07] Concern with what the stars, foretell, or hopes and occasionally fears of the divine intervention
[00:41:13] constitute prejudices which can bias decisions away from realism in towards a wishful
[00:41:19] fantasies.
[00:41:22] That's a weird one to me because you would think that the people that were anti-authoritarian
[00:41:26] would be more superstitious but we didn't run through all the examples of all kinds of examples
[00:41:32] of that.
[00:41:33] All kinds of examples throughout history of people that are authoritarian.
[00:41:36] I mean, Hitler is a good example because he was all into the occult and all that superstitious
[00:41:40] about stuff.
[00:41:44] One of the least, number ten, one of the least attractive aspects of the authoritarian
[00:41:48] personality is his generalized hostility, what the Berkeley researchers called vilification
[00:41:54] of the human, this was a trait that was manifested to such an extreme degree by members
[00:41:57] of the Nazi SS.
[00:41:58] They commit wholesale murder not just without guilt or shame, but perhaps most surprisingly
[00:42:03] without the slightest evidence of revulsion.
[00:42:06] Then he says, finally, there is the fact that authoritarianism itself, so damaging to military
[00:42:16] endeavor will actually predispose an individual towards entering upon the very career
[00:42:22] wherein his restricted personality can wreak the most habits.
[00:42:26] Because there's what I kind of opened up with saying today.
[00:42:30] People that have these tendencies are attracted to the military and he gives a following
[00:42:35] case study case 19, Cecil or Cecil.
[00:42:40] Yeah, I guess Cecil would be a girls name one.
[00:42:43] Yes.
[00:42:44] So Cecil is a male name.
[00:42:45] Yes, sir.
[00:42:46] More of a British name.
[00:42:47] I'm never met in American dude named Cecil of you.
[00:42:49] Yes, sir.
[00:42:50] Really?
[00:42:51] Yeah.
[00:42:52] No, just one.
[00:42:53] Was he from England?
[00:42:54] No.
[00:42:55] No, not again.
[00:42:56] No, not again.
[00:42:57] Cecil.
[00:42:58] Okay.
[00:42:59] Here we go.
[00:43:00] Wait, who's Cecil peoples?
[00:43:01] Oh, that's it.
[00:43:02] That's an actor.
[00:43:03] No, isn't that a UFC guy?
[00:43:06] Cecil peoples?
[00:43:07] So UFC is a commentator or a ref, maybe?
[00:43:11] I think he's a ref.
[00:43:12] I'm drawing a blank for a reason.
[00:43:13] Cecil peoples, right?
[00:43:14] You know, I Cecil people shout out.
[00:43:16] All right.
[00:43:17] I am, if I, if I'm not mistaken, he's a referee.
[00:43:21] Early on.
[00:43:22] Get your phone and go.
[00:43:23] Go, go, go, go.
[00:43:24] Seriously.
[00:43:25] I, I kind of remember him being, yeah, you might be right.
[00:43:31] Might have been a judge.
[00:43:32] Maybe he was a judge.
[00:43:33] Yeah, he seemed like he had some weird background and bare knuckle fighting or something
[00:43:36] and then kind of got early UFC activities going.
[00:43:39] So, Pee, E. O. Pope Cecil peoples.
[00:43:43] Cecil peoples is, eh, there he is.
[00:43:46] Black guy.
[00:43:47] I need support.
[00:43:48] He's a judge.
[00:43:49] Why we need to support MMA judge Cecil peoples.
[00:43:52] But I don't, from what era?
[00:43:55] Hmm.
[00:43:56] What was his background?
[00:43:57] The era that I was watching UFC, which is probably like five years ago and before.
[00:44:03] So, this is the guy that you claim to know.
[00:44:05] I knew I worked with a guy at American Movers.
[00:44:12] Cecil, um, and then there's Cecil people.
[00:44:16] All right, check.
[00:44:17] So here's Cecil R. Who is an obsessive neurotic and I wasn't going to read this thing,
[00:44:22] but I kind of have to, and I'll tell you why, and we'll get to the end.
[00:44:24] His IQ was in the bright normal range, personality testing indicated that he was very dependent
[00:44:28] on his parents, but that they were seen as being emotionally remote and extremely demanding
[00:44:34] infancy.
[00:44:35] He expressed strong feelings of aggression and anger.
[00:44:38] He seemed most interested in the history of wars and in playing war games.
[00:44:43] He shot darts with vigor and delight in the therapist's playroom and if given a choice
[00:44:47] would choose war games, his parents said he refused to play with other children on
[00:44:52] last day, others did exactly what they told him what he told them to do.
[00:44:56] Cecil said, when he grew up, he wanted to be a general.
[00:45:02] So, there you go.
[00:45:05] That's the kind of personality we don't want joined in the military, but that is fired
[00:45:10] up to join the military.
[00:45:14] Next chapter 23, mothers of incompetence were going kind of heavy, not going to go to
[00:45:19] deep into this chapter because it's going a little bit into the psychology world, which
[00:45:23] again, I think this, some of the psychology is a little bit outdated.
[00:45:28] This is coming from me and I'm those psychologists.
[00:45:30] Sounds like a close mine scenario.
[00:45:32] We'll open it up.
[00:45:33] Okay, two points.
[00:45:34] Follow me.
[00:45:35] You caught me.
[00:45:36] I'm busted.
[00:45:37] For the reader, not previously versed in the psychology of authoritarianism, the preceding
[00:45:41] chapter may have come as something to surprise at first sight, the traits of orderliness,
[00:45:46] tough mindedness, obedience to authority.
[00:45:49] Punetiveness and the rest well may have seemed the very embodiment of hard-hitting masculinity
[00:45:56] ideally suited to the job of being a soldier.
[00:46:00] That is an epic statement, right?
[00:46:02] All that's exact.
[00:46:03] And that's what so many people think.
[00:46:04] So many people think that is what we look at foreign military.
[00:46:08] Unfortunately, as represented in the authoritarian personality, they are only skin deep,
[00:46:13] a brittle crust of defenses against feelings of weakness and inadequacy.
[00:46:17] The authoritarian keeps up his spirits by whistling in the dark.
[00:46:21] He is frightened.
[00:46:22] He is the frightened child who wears the armor of a giant.
[00:46:26] His mind is a closed, is a door locked and bolted against that which he fears the most
[00:46:31] himself.
[00:46:32] I didn't get much out of that, but when I did get a lot out of, when I did get a lot out
[00:46:37] of his the fact that when you hear these personality traits, tough mindedness, obedience
[00:46:43] to authority, it sounds like that's what you want.
[00:46:45] You want people to be, you want to answer, you want your soldier to be, you don't.
[00:46:48] It's not what you want.
[00:46:49] It's not what we're looking for.
[00:46:54] Fast forward a little bit.
[00:46:57] Before going on, there's one further point of concerns, the distinction that has been drawn
[00:46:59] between irrational authoritarianism as dealt with here and so called rational authoritarianism.
[00:47:05] So this is just a clarification here.
[00:47:10] By the latter is meant the readiness to accept the no-bay, the dictates of irrational authority.
[00:47:17] Cool.
[00:47:18] There's such a thing.
[00:47:19] He's basically making a distinction here.
[00:47:22] An irrational, antipathy toward all authority is evident in some cases of student militancy,
[00:47:30] may just be, maybe just as neurotic as non-adaptive as a predisposition toward irrational
[00:47:35] authoritarianism.
[00:47:36] The common denominator of irrational authoritarianism and blind anarchy is that both states
[00:47:42] of mind are compulsive and derived from an underlying ego pathology.
[00:47:49] In fact, this distinction between rational and irrational authoritarianism has been implied
[00:47:54] throughout this book.
[00:47:55] Without the exercise, this is why I had to read this part, without the exercise and acceptance
[00:47:59] of rational authority, without certain minimal levels of discipline, and even without certain
[00:48:06] features of bullshit, military organizations would cease to function.
[00:48:10] This is something I have to talk about sometime with clients at Esslime Front because
[00:48:17] decentralized command, we want to have decentralized command, decentralized command, we want
[00:48:21] subordinates to be able to make choices and make decisions.
[00:48:24] And occasionally I'll get a group that's going to wild with that.
[00:48:29] And all of a sudden, we're nothing is centralized anymore.
[00:48:32] And I have to bring up the fact that, hey, guess what kind of uniform every guy in task
[00:48:39] in a bruiser or a matching uniform?
[00:48:41] Why?
[00:48:42] Because we couldn't have some guy that was wearing a pair of blue jeans and a sweatshirt
[00:48:46] out in Ramadi because they would look, they wouldn't look the same.
[00:48:50] And therefore they get shot.
[00:48:52] What happens if I run out of bullets?
[00:48:53] Guess what?
[00:48:54] I can get bullets from someone else and because we're all using the same weapon.
[00:48:57] What about my radio?
[00:48:59] I can use my radio and I can pick up your radio and use it to why because we're using
[00:49:03] the same radio.
[00:49:04] So you have to have some level of centralization, some level of authoritarianism that
[00:49:10] we're all going to kind of be on the same page.
[00:49:14] He says then, it's necessary to labor this point because of some of the semantic confusion
[00:49:18] regarding the term authoritarian.
[00:49:20] Throughout this book, it refers to irrational authoritarianism for the so-called rational
[00:49:25] foretars and we prefer the praise, autocratic behavior, the terms are not synonymous.
[00:49:31] Whereas the autocratic exercise of tight control in the situation demands that the authoritarian
[00:49:34] is himself tightly controlled no matter what the external situation.
[00:49:39] A little semantics there.
[00:49:42] He goes in this next chapter, education of the cult of muscular Christianity.
[00:49:51] This is where he starts talking about the British schools, how these kids were raised
[00:49:59] in sort of like this musk, what he calls muscular Christianity, not kids, but some of the
[00:50:04] kids in this timeframe were raised this way.
[00:50:08] Here's some of the things that are highlighted by the reasons for this stultifying educational
[00:50:13] program are no doubt many and various, but to deserve particular consideration.
[00:50:20] So this is the education program that some of these kids were subjected to.
[00:50:23] The first resides in the belief that enforced application to unpleasant boring tasks develops
[00:50:29] character and the second that any truly intellectual exercise by which is meant the cultivation
[00:50:36] of independent thinking as opposed to wrote learning harms that fine sense of loyalty
[00:50:41] and obedience which such schools strive to inculcate to think is to question and to question
[00:50:50] is to have doubts.
[00:50:51] So you get some examples of how these kids were raised, what they did at these schools,
[00:50:57] they were playing sports, they were do hazing rituals and memorizing things and it was
[00:51:02] all, I mean this is this is true to this day, we've got this sort of school system which
[00:51:06] is meant to teach you to be a good worker.
[00:51:08] That's what it's meant to do.
[00:51:10] It's meant to teach you to be a good worker.
[00:51:13] They don't want, that's why they structure things.
[00:51:16] It's like hey, some of the stuff that you learn in school has no value whatsoever.
[00:51:20] They're just trying to get you to follow the rules, do what they say, get on board with
[00:51:25] the program, follow in line with the authoritarian rulers.
[00:51:29] So we gotta be careful of that.
[00:51:31] Yeah, yeah, sometimes you feel like they, or whatever they are, are doing it on purpose
[00:51:38] and sometimes you just feel like, I think this is just some curriculum that no one had
[00:51:43] the like gusts to do to just be like hey, we're doing it overhaul.
[00:51:47] Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:51:48] I think that at some point, like right now, let's face it, if you would go ground zero
[00:51:54] and restart your educational system and America would be totally different than it is right
[00:51:57] now.
[00:51:58] Yeah.
[00:51:59] Well, it is slowly changing.
[00:52:00] It is slowly changing and I'm not even sure that the way that they're changing is the right
[00:52:03] direction.
[00:52:04] I think they're taking advantage of the fact that it might not have been the best and they're
[00:52:07] changing it to make it worse in some cases.
[00:52:10] Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think in a, from a social standpoint, I think they might have
[00:52:14] kind of too hard in a certain direction.
[00:52:16] Kind of crazy sometimes.
[00:52:18] What kids are learning in school?
[00:52:19] Did you start being in some cases, what kids are learning in school?
[00:52:22] Yeah.
[00:52:23] My only point of reference is my, the elementary school, so my kids go to school.
[00:52:28] I got the full spectrum from elementary school through college.
[00:52:30] I got it all.
[00:52:31] I got it all.
[00:52:32] Do you think, um, what was I just thinking about just now?
[00:52:37] And I'm not really in support of it.
[00:52:39] Yeah.
[00:52:40] Oh, okay.
[00:52:41] Do you think, and I don't know the answer to this, but I just, I do kind of consider the other
[00:52:47] side of this, you know, how you, how you, how you just said, um, the school kind of is structured
[00:52:52] to provide or to develop good workers.
[00:52:54] Right.
[00:52:55] Aren't most people workers anyway?
[00:52:59] Not necessarily.
[00:53:00] No, no, you want to know something what I think is messed up now is I think a lot of times
[00:53:04] the school right now is to develop people to go to college and feed the academic growth
[00:53:11] of colleges.
[00:53:12] Yeah.
[00:53:13] But even that, hey, we're just trying to get you to get, oh, you know, it'd be good for
[00:53:15] you to get a degree in, bringing basket weaving or whatever.
[00:53:20] And no one needs a degree in that.
[00:53:21] There's a lot of degrees that you get that you don't need.
[00:53:23] If you want to learn about that stuff, go read about it.
[00:53:25] Don't pay $200,000 and go into debt to learn about something that has no, it doesn't
[00:53:31] give you a skill set.
[00:53:32] I always felt like a social problem to me.
[00:53:36] It felt like I don't freaking know when I was a kid.
[00:53:41] Not not a kid, but when I was, when I joined the military, I already, I used to use the
[00:53:45] term.
[00:53:46] I don't know if it's ever caught on or I don't know if I've ever heard it, but educational
[00:53:49] inflation.
[00:53:50] Because when I was a kid, if you dropped out of high school, you could still get a job and
[00:53:53] have a normal life.
[00:53:55] Then as I got to high school, it was, hey, it was you got to finish high school.
[00:54:00] If you don't finish high school, you can't get a job blah, blah, blah.
[00:54:03] Then it was that I joined the military.
[00:54:05] Thank God.
[00:54:06] I joined the military.
[00:54:07] But as I joined the military, it was, hey, you know, you really need to really get your,
[00:54:11] whatever, what's a two year degree?
[00:54:13] You're so serious.
[00:54:14] So she, you need to get your social, it's good, it's good.
[00:54:16] So good.
[00:54:17] And then it became matchers.
[00:54:18] And now you've got kids that are going to get in their masters and then they're
[00:54:21] doctorate.
[00:54:22] They spend, they spend their 33 years old, 35 years old, 29 years old.
[00:54:29] For their even getting a job.
[00:54:32] And they've backed up, I mean, this is all now.
[00:54:34] It's all common.
[00:54:35] Like everyone's racking up $3,400, $200,300,000 worth of debt.
[00:54:41] And the skill set that they got in whatever degree they got, it gets them a 29,000 of
[00:54:48] not gonna probably not probably a $38,000 a year job as a whatever, you know, whatever.
[00:54:55] Right?
[00:54:56] Right?
[00:55:00] Whereas if you would have gone to, if you would have dropped out of high school and become an apprentice
[00:55:01] welder right now, you'd be making 128 grand a year because you're a hard worker.
[00:55:06] And by the way, if you're smart, you start, you know, you get, you figure out that welding
[00:55:09] thing and you buy a couple welding, a couple welding machines.
[00:55:14] And you're like, you know what I can get to guys, I can apprentice them, I can teach them.
[00:55:17] Boom, you can grow.
[00:55:18] You can make stuff happen.
[00:55:20] Meanwhile, the person that has $38,000 a year job, they actually have no skill set.
[00:55:25] So, I think a lot of the educational system right now is a feeder program for the college system,
[00:55:33] which is gonna charge people money and this is sort of like the housing crash too.
[00:55:37] So the housing crash came because the government was loaning money or backing up loans
[00:55:42] to people that aren't gonna be able to afford it.
[00:55:45] That was what one of the causes, one of the primary causing of the housing crash.
[00:55:50] Right now, the government backs up these loans that these people get.
[00:55:55] And so they're allowed to get loans for $200, $300,000.
[00:55:58] And they don't realize it, they should, but they don't realize that, hey, you know,
[00:56:03] long it takes to pay off a $300,000 loan, which is by the way, is the only loan that you can't
[00:56:07] go bankrupt from.
[00:56:08] It's gonna, and you're making $39,000 a year.
[00:56:11] And by the way, my, my daughter just graduated college in the spring and a really good college.
[00:56:16] And her friends are making $39,000 a year, $42,000 a year.
[00:56:23] Like they're not making a lot of money.
[00:56:27] So I think a lot of the, what used to feed the workers, now feeds into this, into this educational
[00:56:35] nightmare of college debt and loans and all that.
[00:56:39] That's what's kind of nice about what we're doing at origin because at origin, you don't
[00:56:42] need to college education.
[00:56:43] You can go get a job and get a skill.
[00:56:45] We have a career.
[00:56:46] Right.
[00:56:47] And we got people that have careers now that have learned to skill, that's a highly valuable
[00:56:52] skill.
[00:56:53] And they don't have any debt because they didn't go and study basket weaving for four years
[00:56:59] at $42,000 a year.
[00:57:01] That's getting late.
[00:57:03] And how he skits a better.
[00:57:05] Oh, it almost seems like a basket weaving would be a better skill than some of the degrees
[00:57:09] that people are getting.
[00:57:10] Right.
[00:57:11] I would basically be a skill.
[00:57:12] You can sell baskets.
[00:57:14] But they need to stop harassing basket weavers.
[00:57:18] No, bro.
[00:57:19] It's almost, but it feels, I'm not a economist.
[00:57:23] Or nothing like this, you know that.
[00:57:26] It kind of seems like that there's certain times and then the education is kind of like
[00:57:30] trying to facilitate those times.
[00:57:32] Let me have people running the education and then the times change and then education just
[00:57:38] follows up with the change, but just way, way too late.
[00:57:42] It might even be 50 to 70 years late.
[00:57:45] But yeah.
[00:57:46] And then things, so now think about it, consider that.
[00:57:48] So now that now it changes from like just straight up factory workers to, you know,
[00:57:54] a little bit more advanced workers types.
[00:57:57] Right.
[00:57:58] So now it's like, okay, really the change that should have been made long time ago is
[00:58:01] for you to be influenced to go to college, get a higher education.
[00:58:04] Right.
[00:58:05] Because you have higher level jobs, generally speaking, you know, lower level jobs,
[00:58:09] obviously can exist and all this stuff.
[00:58:10] But just generally speaking, it's just general.
[00:58:12] So boom, now everyone should be going to college long time ago.
[00:58:16] They should be doing that.
[00:58:17] If they want to get a degree that creates way more opportunities back then, there's not
[00:58:20] all these crazy degrees like now there's plenty of degrees.
[00:58:23] When I went to college, like they started doing this program called liberal freaking studies,
[00:58:27] right, which in concept, concept, it's good.
[00:58:31] The concept is good, but probably got to do is get your little degree approved.
[00:58:36] And you can just study whatever you want.
[00:58:38] Essentially, be like, yeah, my degree is in this, as long as the title was approved,
[00:58:42] you can get it.
[00:58:43] It's called liberal studies, but it's, and then you have a title for it.
[00:58:45] Again, you start doing it just for the sake of getting a degree.
[00:58:49] Right.
[00:58:50] When you get out of college, you know, you, you could be jammed up.
[00:58:52] That's what I just said exactly right, but okay, and that's the later part of it.
[00:58:56] But so now you have, and when I say it's a social thing or it feels like a social thing,
[00:59:01] it's kind of like people are still stuck in that little zone that's like, it is
[00:59:04] beneficial to go to college.
[00:59:06] Because there was a point where it's not on that thing.
[00:59:08] So you think that they think that, oh, what are you doing?
[00:59:10] I'm going to go to college.
[00:59:11] Because the day is going on the path.
[00:59:12] Yeah.
[00:59:13] And then it realized that it's not the path.
[00:59:14] That's not the reality right now.
[00:59:15] That's all much has changed.
[00:59:17] And then you have all these people who, like back in the day, you said people can drop
[00:59:21] out of high school and get a job.
[00:59:22] Because yeah, you can drop out of high school because all you have to do is know how to
[00:59:25] read and do basic arithmetic and get a job somewhere.
[00:59:28] Like at a factory or at it, you know, one of the jobs that were freaking prevalent for
[00:59:32] those times as times change, you need a little bit more education now for these jobs.
[00:59:36] What do you end on true?
[00:59:37] What?
[00:59:38] There are always, there's, I mean, there is massive jobs that are, you know, carpentry,
[00:59:45] concretes or plumber, electrician, automatic drive.
[00:59:50] Like there's all these jobs that you definitely do not need a college education to have.
[00:59:55] Yes, sir.
[00:59:56] Do not need it.
[00:59:57] And those are awesome jobs and those, those, those people go out and build America.
[01:00:03] But to your point, you're talking about right now.
[01:00:06] Those jobs, fullies is, but here's two, you're point.
[01:00:11] A lot of people would say, okay, hey, what should I do with my life?
[01:00:17] And the first nine things that come up on their list are go to college, go to college,
[01:00:23] go to college, go to college, where is it when I was in high school.
[01:00:26] Maybe the first thing would be go to college, but the second thing was like becoming a
[01:00:30] apprentice electrician.
[01:00:32] You know, like I took electricity in high school.
[01:00:35] I was saying that was kind of the social kind of, I think that was way more normal.
[01:00:39] There wasn't, there wasn't the mandatory track to college.
[01:00:43] And I think nowadays, almost every kid is being told, go to college, go to college, go
[01:00:48] to college instead of saying, hey, you can go and become an apprentice electrician.
[01:00:53] And that's a freaking great job.
[01:00:55] And you can have a great life.
[01:00:56] And you can contribute to society in a massive way, doing something you enjoy.
[01:01:01] Because look, when I was in high school, I didn't want to be looking at books.
[01:01:05] Right?
[01:01:06] I would much rather be an electrician.
[01:01:09] Much rather be an electrician.
[01:01:11] Yeah.
[01:01:12] And yeah, I think the zone where, okay, basically break it into these two things, where the
[01:01:18] social influence, like, hey, you should go to college or you should whatever or it's okay
[01:01:22] not to go to college, you can just get a job here, whatever.
[01:01:24] This, that passes and changes through time.
[01:01:26] The social, to me, the social part is lagging, like way behind the reality.
[01:01:30] Yes, that's what I'm saying.
[01:01:31] Yes.
[01:01:32] That's a little zone where it was the best to go to college if you had that opportunity.
[01:01:36] That was the zone.
[01:01:38] Right now, socially, the influence is still in that zone.
[01:01:41] They're still saying, it's starting to change, though.
[01:01:44] You start to hear people being like, hey, college, you know, you're going to be able to
[01:01:47] say that stuff.
[01:01:48] Yes, but it's, I think it's still there.
[01:01:50] The reality on the streets is bro, college is for a handful of people and that's it.
[01:01:55] Yeah.
[01:01:56] I want to say, yeah, there's people out there that are actually hiring.
[01:01:59] They're not looking for college degrees.
[01:02:00] And I'm talking to like, I think Peter Teal is one of them.
[01:02:03] And he's out there saying, we'll test.
[01:02:06] I don't know if they got a testing program, but they're saying we just want smart people.
[01:02:09] It doesn't matter where you want to college or not.
[01:02:11] That's, or freaking legit.
[01:02:12] And here's how you know, here's how you kind of, it's kind of like a finger on the
[01:02:17] pot.
[01:02:18] Like this is how you can kind of tell that people are still in the zone of like college is a good
[01:02:21] thing.
[01:02:22] You can be like, oh, yeah, that guy has a degree from Harvard.
[01:02:26] It's like a total appeal appeal to authority.
[01:02:29] The college being the authority by the way, you don't even have to say what he has a degree
[01:02:33] from.
[01:02:34] You can say he has a degree from Harvard.
[01:02:36] And that automatically, I'm not saying that's it, but I'm just saying that in and
[01:02:39] of itself is a point, like a positive thing.
[01:02:42] Yeah.
[01:02:43] I'm saying.
[01:02:44] Yeah.
[01:02:45] You can ask the zone, there'll be like so.
[01:02:46] What's it in?
[01:02:47] What's he doing?
[01:02:48] What's one is I actually hear that right now.
[01:02:50] I'm starting to, I, and people that I know for sure are starting to hear like, oh,
[01:02:55] that person has their MBA or whatever.
[01:02:57] Yeah, whatever.
[01:02:58] Yeah, it's a we're already getting there.
[01:03:00] It's not getting there.
[01:03:02] But when moving in that direction, I hear of those comments.
[01:03:06] Check.
[01:03:07] Back to education here.
[01:03:09] Finally, and perhaps the most fatal of all the private schools ethic of honor and fair
[01:03:14] play.
[01:03:15] So admirable in itself leads to disastrous results when mistakenly imputed to those like
[01:03:21] Hitler who play the game by different center rules.
[01:03:23] So these kids were told, hey, you got to follow the rules.
[01:03:27] And this we play with honor.
[01:03:28] And then Hitler's like, oh, really?
[01:03:29] Watch this.
[01:03:30] This particular weakness of military endeavor continued to feature in many subsequent
[01:03:36] campaigns.
[01:03:37] Indeed is no exaggeration to say that an absence of adequate reconnaissance that refusal
[01:03:43] to believe intelligence reports and a general horror of spying have tended to keep our
[01:03:48] armies wrapped in cocoons of catastrophic ignorance.
[01:03:52] This fatal preference for honorable ignorance rather than useful knowledge, clean by
[01:03:56] devious means was not confined to soldiers in the field, but as an attitude of mind permeated
[01:04:02] the highest levels of all military intelligence.
[01:04:05] So another thing, this is what these kids got educated to do.
[01:04:08] They got educated to live with honor.
[01:04:11] That means we're not going to sneak around.
[01:04:12] We're not going to cheat.
[01:04:13] I had to watch out for that.
[01:04:14] Sometimes you get the like, well, I, these for cowards.
[01:04:18] Like, okay, we get it.
[01:04:19] That's for cowards.
[01:04:20] But as well.
[01:04:21] I, E.D.s, roadside.
[01:04:22] All right, we try to go that out.
[01:04:24] You know, that's a coward.
[01:04:25] Yeah, sure.
[01:04:26] It is.
[01:04:27] Guess what?
[01:04:28] We have to contend with it just because it's cowardly.
[01:04:30] It doesn't mean it's going to go away.
[01:04:31] It doesn't mean it doesn't produce dead bodies and main bodies.
[01:04:34] Is it cowardly?
[01:04:36] Yes, it is.
[01:04:37] How do we counter it?
[01:04:38] Hmm.
[01:04:39] So you put some sniper overwatch on some roads and shwack some people.
[01:04:42] That's how you counter it.
[01:04:44] Like a reformed, because enormously successful, burglar, who self-righteously puts down his
[01:04:51] gemmy to take up proselytizing on the evils of crime, we took to repudiating these very
[01:04:58] traits, push cleverness, ruthless and sheer naked aggression that it put us where we are.
[01:05:05] The reason that, so what he's saying is, you like a criminal that sort of makes it and
[01:05:10] like all of a sudden puts down his thieving tools and starts saying, you know, thieving
[01:05:14] it's bad and you're going to be right just wet.
[01:05:16] But he's forgetting about how he got there.
[01:05:18] And what he's what the point he's making here is we can have a tendency to do that.
[01:05:22] Like, hey, in war, if you got to be brutal, we're on top because we were brutal.
[01:05:28] We're on top because we spied and you know, broke shit and killed people.
[01:05:33] That's what got us here and we can't now set up here.
[01:05:36] So let's all roll.
[01:05:39] You got to be careful about that.
[01:05:43] Now we get to part three of this book.
[01:05:49] Interestingly enough, you want to hear what quote it starts off, there's no bad regiments
[01:05:52] only bad officers.
[01:05:53] All right, we've heard Napoleon say it.
[01:05:55] We've heard hackworth said, we've heard echelon front say we know that quote is an extreme
[01:06:02] ownership.
[01:06:03] Well, it's we're using a different quote.
[01:06:04] No bad teams, only bad leaders is what we said.
[01:06:07] Did we steal it?
[01:06:08] Yes, we stole it from hackworth.
[01:06:12] And hackworth steal it from field martial lord slim who is in World War I World War II wounded
[01:06:20] three times and guess what, he stole it from Napoleon.
[01:06:25] So we're stealing it.
[01:06:26] We're using it.
[01:06:27] Can't steal.
[01:06:28] It's free.
[01:06:29] Okay.
[01:06:30] We're attributing.
[01:06:33] Also too much of history is written as though men had no feelings, no childhood, no bodily
[01:06:38] senses, which is something that I have tried with all my might, with this podcast to make
[01:06:49] sure that history is written.
[01:06:53] And it's clear that these men had feelings, had bodily senses, had childhoods and beyond
[01:07:00] that had hopes and dreams for the future.
[01:07:02] A lot of histories not written like that.
[01:07:06] Section here called the worst and the best.
[01:07:07] So now what he does is he starts pointing out some, and this is why I can start moving a
[01:07:12] little bit faster.
[01:07:13] I told you before we started recording like, hey, there's a big chunk of the book we're
[01:07:16] going to cover and cover and what podcast because he starts going into a lot of details
[01:07:21] and it's worth reading.
[01:07:23] You have to get the book if you want to read all these things.
[01:07:25] But he starts pointing out the worst and the best of some of these military leaders.
[01:07:31] He said this about Hitler or John Strauss and said this about Hitler in a war from which
[01:07:36] so much human error had been eliminated by technological advances alone.
[01:07:40] Human error was still the principal factor in determining wars outcome.
[01:07:45] Hitler, slip knot.
[01:07:48] A little bit about Hitler.
[01:07:49] Hitler's particular brand of military incompetence is precisely what one would expect.
[01:07:53] He showed a total unconcern for the physical and psychological welfare of his men and
[01:07:58] his armies.
[01:07:59] And we, man, when we covered Stalin Grot, remember when we covered Stalin Grot on this
[01:08:02] podcast?
[01:08:03] Actually, a book called Stalin Grot.
[01:08:05] He was written by a Nazi soldier and they were listening on the radio as they were surrounded
[01:08:14] and they were listening to Hitler talk about praising their dying to the last man.
[01:08:23] That's like insane.
[01:08:28] Number two, his imperviousness to human suffering, which resulted in such enormous waste
[01:08:32] of his own forces was a contributary factor in his stubborn refusal to ever relinquish
[01:08:37] gained ground.
[01:08:39] Three from his extreme ethnocentrism came another well-known form of military incompetence
[01:08:45] that which results from a gross underestimation of the enemy and in particular of the ability
[01:08:50] of civilian populations to withstand the effect of war.
[01:08:53] Yep.
[01:08:54] Thinking that your Nazi soldiers are just superior and then you come up against the Russians
[01:09:00] civilians and they're like, what?
[01:09:03] One play?
[01:09:05] And thinking that they're just going to fold.
[01:09:08] Thinking that the Russians are just the Russians civilian populace and even their
[01:09:11] red army, which is, you know, bait up of, you know, peasant soldiers, they're going to
[01:09:17] fold under the might of the Nazis.
[01:09:21] You might want to check yourself, homey.
[01:09:25] While many of foreign, while many of Hitler's decisions were military disastrous, his underlying
[01:09:29] ego weakness and fear of criticism eventually in several other traits which are under
[01:09:34] desirable to say the least in a military senior commander.
[01:09:38] He promoted his AIDS and advisors for their sick of the C rather than their ability.
[01:09:44] Just promote people because they sucked up to him.
[01:09:47] He refused to accept, believe, or even listen to unpalatable intelligence and when things
[01:09:50] got went really wrong, he was first to find scapegoats, opposite of extreme ownership,
[01:09:56] promoting people because they kissed your ass.
[01:09:58] Not listening to intelligence coming in.
[01:10:01] This is having closed mind being an idiot.
[01:10:05] Like his henchmen, himler, even Hitler, could on occasion show that over control of aggression,
[01:10:10] that procrastination, which has incapacitated some other authoritarian military commanders,
[01:10:16] perhaps his most disastrous decision of the war was when he halted the German advance
[01:10:20] before Dunkirk, thus allowing the British to escape.
[01:10:24] Finally on April 22nd, 1945, Hitler failed as a military commander in a way that he had never
[01:10:30] failed before, and advocating responsibility he betrayed his command.
[01:10:34] And if you're a Ben and leadership in duty like so, yeah, he quit.
[01:10:38] He's the ultimate quitter, D.O.R.D.O.R.D.D.D., drop on request on April 22nd, 1945, and then a few days later, on April 30th, killed himself.
[01:11:02] He was a good person dumb.
[01:11:12] All those things, not stupid.
[01:11:15] So you can be really smart and do really dumb things because you're authoritarian, because
[01:11:20] your ego is out of control, etc.
[01:11:22] Some good examples.
[01:11:26] General Sir James Wolff.
[01:11:29] He's bitterly and unfashionally opposed to what he called the spirit-breaking tactics of
[01:11:33] harsh punishment and drill.
[01:11:35] Was quite prepared to disobey orders if these conflicted with what he knew was right.
[01:11:39] That sees us going through like these are the opposite of authoritarian personalities.
[01:11:43] This guy's Sir James Wolff, I'm going to burn through some of these at the risk of making himself
[01:11:47] on popular.
[01:11:48] He forced his officers to attend the welfare of their men to visit their living quarters,
[01:11:53] have regard for their health and generally get to know them as fellow human beings.
[01:11:59] Wellington.
[01:12:00] Next guy, he highlights here.
[01:12:02] Wellington did not even science of emotional restriction, did not remain unmoved by human
[01:12:06] suffering.
[01:12:07] Suffering did not seek popularity was unimpressed by bull and did not seek scapegoats for
[01:12:13] his military setbacks.
[01:12:15] This is a good leader.
[01:12:17] He spurned the decorations of authority.
[01:12:20] Large staffs, centuries, gold braids.
[01:12:23] We didn't want to be all dressed up.
[01:12:26] Wellington's self-confidence is also reflected in his refusal to make scapegoats of others.
[01:12:32] Thus up the Burgos fiasco he said, I see that a disposition already exists to blame the
[01:12:37] government for the failure of the siege of Burgos.
[01:12:41] It was entirely my own act.
[01:12:45] Thankfully he didn't put that into a book and call it extreme ownership.
[01:12:48] Otherwise I would have been kind of out of luck.
[01:12:50] Because that's what he did.
[01:12:52] Here's the bad situation that unfolded during the siege and he took ownership of it.
[01:12:57] Then blame anybody.
[01:13:01] As usual after a battle his mood was set by the losses, not the glory.
[01:13:06] On the morning after the siege, another Wellington showed himself to his deeply astonished
[01:13:12] staff.
[01:13:13] He visited the dead and on seeing so many of his finest men destroyed, he broke down and
[01:13:17] swept.
[01:13:22] Finally he displayed an open mind to new ideas, quick to innovate and see advantages in the
[01:13:30] progress of technology.
[01:13:31] Use remarkably laws a fair regarding the dress of his soldiers.
[01:13:38] Thirdly he did not commit that cardinal error of so many military incompetence under
[01:13:42] the rest of the enemy, he took infinite plans, pains and military planning, left nothing
[01:13:48] to chance, selected officers for their efficiency, always did recon.
[01:13:52] So you can see what he's getting out here.
[01:13:53] Shaka, the Zulu King of his general ship that has been written.
[01:14:01] Shaka's particular genius, laying his meticulous personal attention to detail and sheer
[01:14:07] hard work.
[01:14:08] If it all possible, he always insisted on inspecting everything himself in every one of
[01:14:12] his critical battles he insisted on personal recon ordering the ground and the disposition
[01:14:17] of enemy forces, he invariably checked all reports by procuring collateral evidence.
[01:14:23] Shaka could also be humane.
[01:14:25] He talks about Shaka actually being pretty brutal to his men, which I don't always
[01:14:31] a little bit thinking, well, why are you trying to give this guy as this great example?
[01:14:36] Who's who hesitated to follow his example in painful initiation where instantly clubbed
[01:14:40] the death?
[01:14:41] It seems a little authoritarian to me, bro.
[01:14:43] Dixon, where are you at?
[01:14:44] Well, I mean, if we're cutting some slack here, so here's the deal.
[01:14:49] Another example of his flexibility and refusal to dominate a by tradition was Shaka's
[01:14:54] banning of sandals for his fighting men.
[01:14:56] By making them run barefoot, a considerable and by no means popular break with tradition,
[01:14:59] he invested his army, the speed of movement, foreign access of that achievement by his enemies.
[01:15:04] The displeasure he incurred through this innovation was hardly reduced by an order to his
[01:15:09] warriors that they should harden their feet on the parade ground, stroom with thorns.
[01:15:14] Those who hesitated to follow him in his example in this painful tradition were instantly
[01:15:18] clubbed the death.
[01:15:19] Seems a little authoritarian there, bro.
[01:15:23] But Dixon says that Shaka could also be humane as well as punitive in caring for his
[01:15:30] army to ensure that his fighting men were kept warm, well rested and well fed and orderly
[01:15:34] was provided for every three soldiers under his command.
[01:15:37] No battles fought without adequate supplies of food, water, and bark dressings being assembled
[01:15:42] at strategic points beforehand.
[01:15:44] It can be summed up as autocratic, totally non-authoritarian, high-enachievement motivation
[01:15:49] and yet capable of great warmth and sympathy.
[01:15:52] According to Ritter, he was highly emotional and sentimental behind a facade of iron-clad
[01:15:57] iron self-discipline the fact that he was the finest composer of songs.
[01:16:01] The leading dancer and wittyest punster suggests an artist who would naturally have a highly
[01:16:07] strong nature and more sensitive than the comber common run of the Nungi race.
[01:16:14] So there's Shaka Napoleon.
[01:16:18] The evidence suggests that though he was ambitious ruthless, devious unscrupulous, grand
[01:16:22] geos, despotic, Machiavellian, dictatorial and autocratic he was not authoritarian.
[01:16:29] Again, this is where he's getting some semantics here that's kind of like, mmmm.
[01:16:35] Napoleon could be the reverse of extra punitive, the fault to argue lay not so much
[01:16:40] of the men as with himself.
[01:16:43] So he, when things were didn't go the way he wanted, he often said it was his fault.
[01:16:48] Cool.
[01:16:50] I think he's stretching, man, on Napoleon.
[01:16:55] Because I think it's a scale, right?
[01:16:57] Napoleon, I think, had an open mind when it came to combat.
[01:17:00] But I think he was an ego maniac.
[01:17:02] We have a free what's that?
[01:17:03] Napoleon complex, right?
[01:17:05] You're all little and trying to be big.
[01:17:09] Stern and Imperius II, in his business hours, Napoleon was all ease and sunshine to his
[01:17:14] sentiments.
[01:17:15] They admired his pleasant wit, his unaffected gate, he's rich and brilliant, handing of
[01:17:18] moral and political themes.
[01:17:20] And he's trying to make him out to be a little less authoritarian than he was in my opinion.
[01:17:25] But some of these guy, even the guy Chuck Azulu, he was maybe he was authoritarian in certain
[01:17:32] ways.
[01:17:33] That's what I just said, it's a scale, right?
[01:17:35] Or whatever in other ways.
[01:17:36] And he kind of found Chuck a balance.
[01:17:38] Yeah, so like back to Chuck, he would be not what is the one, what's the opposite of
[01:17:44] authoritarian, authoritarian?
[01:17:47] Libre, what's the opposite?
[01:17:48] Well, yeah, he was anti.
[01:17:51] Except when it came to those feet, man, those feet got it, you know, like, you got a
[01:17:54] like, how you guys say, you got the line on some stuff.
[01:17:57] You know, those radios, you got to know how to program your radios.
[01:18:00] But the patches, that's like a little bit.
[01:18:03] So Chuck was like that with a lot of stuff.
[01:18:05] So man, Chuck, kind of keeping it real.
[01:18:06] Kind of keeping it real.
[01:18:07] Kind of keeping it real, you know.
[01:18:09] But that's how, right?
[01:18:10] That's the day caught him.
[01:18:11] Yeah.
[01:18:12] That's the day caught him in.
[01:18:13] And I think that's, he's trying to point out some of that day caught him.
[01:18:15] I think he's leaning to try and show these good leaders as being less of them.
[01:18:18] authoritarian.
[01:18:19] Yeah.
[01:18:20] Because Napoleon, I mean, gusher, you know, Hitler, Napoleon, these guys like, yeah, they
[01:18:27] lost and they lost huge and they're bad.
[01:18:30] But they did some effective stuff.
[01:18:31] Oh, yeah, well, Napoleon, I mean, Napoleon won a lot.
[01:18:36] And Hitler won a lot too, man.
[01:18:38] That's what I'm saying.
[01:18:39] So let's crack kick in and off.
[01:18:40] Took over giant swaths of Europe and Napoleon did the same thing.
[01:18:46] So there was definitely some, they did some shit that was that they want.
[01:18:50] It was effective.
[01:18:51] Yeah.
[01:18:52] And by the way, there's other people that were totally authoritarian that did authoritarian
[01:18:56] shit and law and also want the Crimean War, right?
[01:19:01] With the brits, the brits were doing the dumbest, most horrible authoritarian ego driven
[01:19:07] moves and getting guys killed by the bushel and yet they still were able to win.
[01:19:16] This is a little bit more about Napoleon, finally like many of the other commanders on our
[01:19:19] list.
[01:19:20] Napoleon was without that vanity.
[01:19:22] This like struck me bro, without that vanity which Patokan's a week ego was notoriously
[01:19:26] careless about his dress, had a wide range of intellectual interests and promoted his
[01:19:30] subordinates on the basis of their efficiency.
[01:19:32] Okay.
[01:19:33] So that's cool.
[01:19:34] Makes sense.
[01:19:35] Nor did he display the debilitating over control of aggression, which his on occasion
[01:19:39] is paralyzed, warlike behavior of less successful commanders.
[01:19:44] Nelson.
[01:19:45] Nelson did not display a compulsive concern with Ordea Lenniss if his dress was anxious to
[01:19:53] give pleasure to everyone about him distinguishing each turn by some act of kindness and chiefly
[01:19:58] those who seem to require it.
[01:20:00] The most Nelson seems like he's just a really good guy.
[01:20:04] And he residual doubts one might have regarding Nelson's freedom from the crippling effects
[01:20:07] of a week ego should be resolved by considering his most famous characteristic disobedience.
[01:20:13] Possessing boundless moral courage.
[01:20:15] He was himself prepared to disobey if he fought it to the advantage of his country.
[01:20:21] And often he was right.
[01:20:22] Nelson was in fact always urging others even allies, superiors and officials of the army
[01:20:26] to disregard their orders if necessary and what he thought was to be the general interest
[01:20:32] of the cause.
[01:20:34] This is one of the best quotes on decentralized command I have ever heard in my life.
[01:20:42] So this is Nelson.
[01:20:45] Nelson's own view of this matter was uncomplicated as he said to the Duke of Clarence
[01:20:52] to serve my king and to destroy the French I consider as the great order of all from which
[01:21:00] little one spring.
[01:21:03] And if one of these little ones militate against it for who can exactly tell at a distance
[01:21:10] I go back and obey the great order and object.
[01:21:15] That's a beautiful understanding of decentralized command.
[01:21:19] Here's what we're trying to get done.
[01:21:20] And there's a bunch of different ways you can get it done.
[01:21:22] I'm telling you to do something but it doesn't quite make sense in supporting the strategic
[01:21:25] goal.
[01:21:26] Don't do it.
[01:21:27] Do something else.
[01:21:29] So that's a non-authoritarian mindset which is good to go.
[01:21:36] See Lawrence Lawrence of Arabia of his general ship, L'Adele Hart Row Lawrence can bear
[01:21:41] comparison with Mar-Bron Napoleon in that vital faculty of general ship.
[01:21:46] The power of grasping instantly the picture of the ground in situation of relating the
[01:21:51] one to the other and the local to the general.
[01:21:53] He was able to see what was happening not just what's happening right there but see it in
[01:21:57] the big picture.
[01:21:58] He was able to attach take a step back, look around.
[01:22:01] I think strategic L'Adele Hart considered that Lawrence also showed the same profound
[01:22:06] profound understanding of human nature, the same power of commanding affection while
[01:22:11] commanding energy and the same consummate blend of diplomacy with strategy.
[01:22:16] At a cool head, L'Adele Hart also considered that Lawrence the most widely read of generals
[01:22:23] was more of a steep denogged of war than any other generals of the last one.
[01:22:29] In personality, this one read a little bit more because well because this in personality
[01:22:34] Lawrence is probably the least authoritarian senior commander of the world as ever known.
[01:22:39] He was totally without personal ambition, refused promotion, honors and awards for himself
[01:22:46] and deplored the pump, vanities and ritualized bowing and scraping which won associate with
[01:22:52] the power structure of the hierarchical command systems.
[01:22:57] We like this guy.
[01:22:58] How do they get?
[01:22:59] Yeah, we're down.
[01:23:02] The fact that he could renounce his name for that of Ross and later Sean happily
[01:23:07] resume his role of a lowly ranker after achieving worldwide fame indicates a degree of
[01:23:13] self-effacement quite unique amongst military men.
[01:23:18] Contrary to a characteristic predisposition of authoritarian individuals, Lawrence disliked
[01:23:24] interfering with other men's freedom.
[01:23:29] You can't impose on other people you shouldn't impose on other people you shouldn't
[01:23:32] mess with their freedom.
[01:23:34] He disliked giving orders and in fact exercised effective command largely through the
[01:23:41] tendering of advice.
[01:23:44] Have you ever heard of your late father and explained how many times I gave him a direct
[01:23:48] order?
[01:23:49] Oh yes, I have heard him explain the number.
[01:23:56] Zero times.
[01:23:58] That this advice was acted upon suggest that by his personality he achieved a level of
[01:24:02] leadership rarely attained by military commanders.
[01:24:06] He himself was prepared to obey foolish orders but disliked passing these on to others
[01:24:10] as La Dal Hart remarks and war such orders are often the result useless sacrifice of men's
[01:24:16] lives in peace they often contribute to the sterilization of men's reason.
[01:24:20] Oh that's a good one.
[01:24:22] You barco orders, you make people do what you want them to do, you're going to sterilize
[01:24:27] their brain.
[01:24:31] Lawrence was a great respect to reason and consider that the possession of knowledge was
[01:24:35] of primary importance for a military leader.
[01:24:38] In his opinion, quote, the perfect general would know everything in heaven and earth and
[01:24:43] quote by the same token this most open minded of men deported the closed and vaccus minds
[01:24:50] of his military compatriots of men who displayed a quote fundamental crippling, incuriousness.
[01:24:57] There you go.
[01:25:00] T.E. Lawrence.
[01:25:03] We got slim who this thing kicked off with, general slim like so many generals when plans
[01:25:07] have gone wrong.
[01:25:08] Oh, you take a little bit of ownership here.
[01:25:11] Like so many generals, as a quote, when so many generals like so many generals when plans
[01:25:15] have gone wrong, I could find plenty of excuses.
[01:25:18] But only one reason myself.
[01:25:22] When two courses of action were open to me, I had not chosen as a good commander should
[01:25:27] the boulder.
[01:25:28] I had taken counsel of my fears and bad reference.
[01:25:33] There is no evidence here of that telltale defense projection and even though he had ample
[01:25:39] opportunity for making scapegoats to those subordinates who had given the advice which
[01:25:43] tended to failure.
[01:25:44] So you got another guy slim.
[01:25:46] Had he written a book and taken, you know, given it a cool title like extreme ownership.
[01:25:52] We mean a different spot right now.
[01:25:56] Taken into account with other traits as warmth towards his family is absence of rigidity
[01:26:00] as parsimony with the lives of his men, his ability to improvise his popularity with
[01:26:04] the troops and relative lack of concern regarding his popularity with his equals.
[01:26:08] She had come as no surprise to learn that this shiverless, autocratic and most efficient
[01:26:12] of generals enjoyed a happy childhood apparently unmarked by those stresses and strange
[01:26:17] which may weaken the ego and stunt the personality.
[01:26:20] He kind of, in I've been skipping these parts a little bit.
[01:26:23] I'm guessing being a little bit biased, but I'm skipping a lot of the clothes like go
[01:26:26] and analysis because you know that and I'm just giving you that little taste of them.
[01:26:31] You want to get some of that.
[01:26:32] You got to kind of get into it here a little bit.
[01:26:36] His next section is exceptions to the rule.
[01:26:39] Got a little quote here from Rommel.
[01:26:41] One must not judge everyone in the world by his qualities as a soldier otherwise we should
[01:26:46] have no civilization that's Rommel to his son.
[01:26:50] Interesting.
[01:26:52] In confidence is not confined to those who were extreme in their ineptitude but may operate
[01:26:58] a long line of a continuum of military excellence from worst to the best senior commanders.
[01:27:06] Military shortcomings of Montgomery, Kitchener and Hague and their positions along a dimension
[01:27:12] of authoritarianism are perfectly correlated.
[01:27:16] So this is what you were saying earlier.
[01:27:19] It's not like, oh, this is either a authoritarian or you're not.
[01:27:24] You could be anywhere on this spectrum.
[01:27:26] And as we have been discussing, you want to have some level of authoritarianism.
[01:27:30] You just don't want too much.
[01:27:31] It's got to be a balance.
[01:27:32] But some people can be, oh, they're a little bit in the red.
[01:27:36] Some people full green.
[01:27:38] Maybe some people too much green.
[01:27:39] They're going to make it.
[01:27:40] But I think in the military, people that are far green don't even join the military.
[01:27:44] We got to remember that people might even in there.
[01:27:47] So you already have a composite of people that are a little bit at least in the middle.
[01:27:51] Maybe a little bit orange.
[01:27:52] Some people lean in in the red.
[01:27:55] And it's a continuum.
[01:27:58] Talking about Montgomery, and again, you got to get, if you want the details of this,
[01:28:02] read, get the book.
[01:28:03] It's not my purpose to debate Montgomery's greatness of face to say that, while not without
[01:28:07] blemishes, he was in the main, a highly competent commander, and as such needs to be considered
[01:28:13] in present context, does he or does he not support the hypothesis that competence depends
[01:28:17] upon an absence of authoritarianism and its associated traits.
[01:28:22] So that's what we're really hearing there is that.
[01:28:24] The more authoritarian you are, the worse you're going to be.
[01:28:27] Unless you have zero authoritarianism.
[01:28:31] And he points out some things that makes him not authoritarianism.
[01:28:35] Authoritarianistic.
[01:28:36] Here's Montgomery lacked those obsessive traits, which tend to accompany authoritarianism.
[01:28:40] He's not particularly mean or particularly obstinate and judging from his own dress and
[01:28:44] leaning it attitude towards that of his troops.
[01:28:46] He did not harbor any compulsive urge for a bull.
[01:28:49] In this, as in other matters, his approach was essentially realistic.
[01:28:54] Seems that whatever else he may be, Montgomery does not advance a well-documented signs
[01:29:00] of authoritarianism.
[01:29:01] And yet, even in this case, there remains the undisputable fact that for all his greatness
[01:29:05] as a military commander, Montgomery did have serious shortcomings which could not be attributed
[01:29:10] to a lack of professional ability.
[01:29:13] So Montgomery did some jack-up things, and we covered it in one of the earlier podcasts.
[01:29:17] We also covered it on a podcast, not about this book.
[01:29:23] These lapses were an inability to get along with many of his military colleagues.
[01:29:29] Like Kitchener, he had a knack of making himself enormously unpopular with his contemporaries
[01:29:33] and preferred the company of younger and more junior officers.
[01:29:35] It was a bad sign of talking about this on the Academy of the other day.
[01:29:39] Extremeownership.com.
[01:29:41] Somebody who's talking about it can't get along.
[01:29:43] If you're not getting along with people, you're doing a bad job.
[01:29:45] But what's wrong with you?
[01:29:47] Aren't you getting along with people?
[01:29:49] You should be getting along with people.
[01:29:50] It was part of your job.
[01:29:51] Build relationships.
[01:29:52] What's happening with you?
[01:29:55] Montgomery's second shortcoming was that he sometimes allowed his own desire for personal
[01:30:00] glory to influence planning, a military plan tainted by an attempt to satisfy the commander's
[01:30:04] ego is unlikely to be the best plan, and irrelevant factor has been introduced into the
[01:30:09] calculation.
[01:30:10] Clearly, that's jacked up.
[01:30:12] Montgomery's next shortcoming presents something of a paradox, a concerns, a matter
[01:30:15] of communication.
[01:30:16] From man who is a depth that simplifying the apparently complex, whose ability to extract
[01:30:21] the essentials from a host of irrelevant factors was second to none, who could communicate
[01:30:27] his intentions and issue orders to his subordinates with the lucidity that left no room for
[01:30:31] misinterpretation, and who could write his memoirs with such a style that puts most generals
[01:30:36] to shame.
[01:30:37] It is extraordinary that he should have been almost incapable of explaining himself to those
[01:30:41] above him in the J.D.
[01:30:42] Command.
[01:30:43] Kind of crazy.
[01:30:44] Got a whole big explanation on Montgomery and who wears some of that stuff came from
[01:30:50] fast forward a little bit to Kitchener Kitchener who became Secretary of State in the
[01:30:53] First World War had, according to Philip Magnus, two basic attributes and unparalleled
[01:30:59] thoroughness and an unparalleled drive.
[01:31:02] He was an individual, individualist of great conceptions, whose hard and selfless nature
[01:31:06] was capable at times of kindness, sympathy, and even affection.
[01:31:10] His traits, his excessive drive, Lord Curson, once described Kitchener as this molten
[01:31:16] massive devouring energy, his individualism, and his refusal to conform the originality
[01:31:21] of his thinking and the occasional flashes of underlying warmth and generosity are hard
[01:31:26] to reconcile with the notion of authoritarianism.
[01:31:29] So he's got Montgomery who has some authoritarianism, Kitchener is a little bit more authoritarianism
[01:31:36] and as we push through his authoritarianism from Kitchener for all his greatness, Kitchener
[01:31:41] seems to have been a victim of the repressive forces in place in him as a child, presumably
[01:31:46] as a marionette of his father.
[01:31:48] Then psychoanalytics going on, but what were those traits, regardless of where they came from,
[01:31:53] his elufness, his unpopularism, many of his fellow officers, his failure to work as part
[01:31:58] of a team.
[01:31:59] And most damaging of all is latter-day indecisiveness and hesitancy in directing, collipally,
[01:32:03] and pain must be ascribed to defects of the personality rather than intellect.
[01:32:07] And again, it's just interesting to point out that authoritarianism, you'd think that
[01:32:12] makes people make calls, but it actually freaks them out in these pressures that you
[01:32:18] waste because they don't want to get, they don't, they don't, they don't handle failure
[01:32:22] that don't know what to do and they just, they don't want to do anything.
[01:32:25] Run to, run to, run, go off!
[01:32:27] Where's somebody that's a little less authoritarian?
[01:32:29] So like, okay, you know what, we've got to make a call here.
[01:32:31] That's what we're doing.
[01:32:32] Now, we get to Hague, and trying to answer the question whether the recurring features
[01:32:39] of military incompetence derived from aspects of the authoritarian personality even in
[01:32:43] a commander who ultimately emerged victorious.
[01:32:45] One cannot do better than consider the case of Douglas Hague, Commander-in-Chief of the
[01:32:49] British armies on the Western Front between 1915 and 1918.
[01:32:54] Dudging from the war of words, which has raged between his detractors and devotees, there
[01:32:58] was never a more controversial military commander.
[01:33:00] Here's some quotes, Hague, Britain's number one war criminal, expected Germans to advance
[01:33:07] in this attack and at the same time slow, at the same slow pace of his own clumsily planned
[01:33:12] results.
[01:33:13] Another quote, he seemed to be most highly equipped thinker in the British army.
[01:33:17] That's totally different quote.
[01:33:19] Another quote, Hague perhaps failed to see that a dead man cannot advance and that to
[01:33:23] replace him is only to provide another corpse.
[01:33:26] Here's another quote, it is indeed strange that the man who stubbornness in the offensive
[01:33:30] had all but ruined us on the Psalm should from August 1918 onwards have become the driving
[01:33:37] force of the Allied armies.
[01:33:39] That is crazy.
[01:33:40] You freaking conduct this horrible operation.
[01:33:42] So many people die and you just continue being in charge and directing operations.
[01:33:47] Hague was unimaginative, maybe he was competent according to his lights, but these were
[01:33:52] dim, confidence of divine approval appeared to satisfy him.
[01:33:56] Nothing can excuse the casualties of the Psalm and passion dale.
[01:33:59] World War I, freaking nightmare.
[01:34:05] So what's up with his personality?
[01:34:08] Did Hague evince those character traits that are associated with authoritarianism?
[01:34:13] He certainly had most of them.
[01:34:15] First start he was conservative, conventional and it is added to toward the French
[01:34:19] Eiffnose centric, his diary and dispatch is suggest he was unemotional and totally anti-interceptive
[01:34:26] IE not one to reflect upon his own motives.
[01:34:30] He was manifestly lacking in compassion towards his fellow men.
[01:34:34] It's just so important to hear these things, just to think, what do you think a military
[01:34:38] commander should be like and what should a military commander actually be like?
[01:34:43] He was a confirmed believer in the direction of events by supernatural powers and reserved
[01:34:49] to the point of being verbally almost inarticulate.
[01:34:52] Hague also betrayed that triad of traits which, according to contemporary research, defines
[01:34:58] the obsessive character and correlated with authoritarianism.
[01:35:04] He was obstinate, orderly and mean.
[01:35:09] About his obstinacy, little further need to be said from the beginning to the end his handling
[01:35:13] of the 30 braze, betoken and obscenancy of statuesque proportions.
[01:35:19] His gallouge is stubborn, never changed his mind.
[01:35:21] We're sticking with the plan.
[01:35:22] For the second trait in his dress, habits and appearance, Hague was a maculate, orderly and
[01:35:26] quite probably the cleanest man on the western front, a contemporary of his at Clifton,
[01:35:31] remembered him particularly for his cleanliness, a remarkable attribute to be recalled
[01:35:36] of a fellow schoolboy.
[01:35:37] In the first, for an example of his love of bull, there's this excerpt from a cavalryman,
[01:35:43] cavalryman's letter, quote, he had a personal escort consisting of a full troop of his own
[01:35:48] regimen.
[01:35:49] They were easily the smartest thing in France, not a buck a lot of place, stripes of gold for
[01:35:54] the NCOs, silver, great silver skull and crossbones, and quote, other writers have commented
[01:36:01] on his meticulous attention to my new detail and his habit of planning each day according
[01:36:06] to a set pattern.
[01:36:07] So there you go.
[01:36:15] Any breaks out, basically, saying Montgomery, out of those three was the best and had the
[01:36:20] least authoritarian nature, Kitchener, little bit more authoritarian, little bit worse performance
[01:36:26] and then finally you get to Hague, total authoritarian attitude, and well, the worst,
[01:36:33] example, and the worst leader.
[01:36:36] And now we're getting to the final chapter of this book, Six Podcasts, Deep Spinos.
[01:36:45] I went hard in the paint, retreat, this one's called, Hail, ye, indomitable heroes, hail,
[01:36:55] despite all of your generals, ye prevailed.
[01:36:58] That's from a land or who wrote a poem about the Crimean heroes and I just was talking
[01:37:03] about this, right?
[01:37:04] The Brits want, the Brits and their allies beat the Russian, despite their shitty leadership.
[01:37:16] Classwits, this does difficulty in seeing things correctly, which is one of the greatest
[01:37:21] sources of friction and war makes things appear quite different from what was expected.
[01:37:27] Good job, classmates.
[01:37:29] You know what you better learn how to do if you want to see things correctly, you better
[01:37:32] learn to detach, you better learn to take a step back, you better learn to put your ego
[01:37:36] and check, you better learn to get control over your emotions, so you're not seeing through
[01:37:39] an e-gatistical or emotional lens.
[01:37:45] It is not the intention to leave a comparable impression of general ship, but rather to
[01:37:51] show that the nature of interspicy, that the nature of interspicy's aggression predisposes
[01:37:59] the leaders of armies and navies to certain sorts of error.
[01:38:04] So you're saying, look, when you start fighting and killing each other, it leads to certain
[01:38:08] types of error, just in its own right.
[01:38:12] Then he says, from far from diminishing the stature of senior military commanders, the existence
[01:38:18] of this predisposition makes the performance of the majority of soldiers and sailors doubly
[01:38:25] credible.
[01:38:26] So there's so much natural disaster about to happen that when someone does a good job,
[01:38:33] you should get double credit, two gold stars.
[01:38:37] For being able to pull it off, when there's all this natural gravity towards chaos, may
[01:38:43] have destruction, ego, authoritarian personalities, all that stuff is going on and yet some
[01:38:49] people's most military people from the bottom to the top do a good job and overcome
[01:38:55] that.
[01:38:56] So you should get double the credit.
[01:39:00] And this is all kind of a conclusion here.
[01:39:02] The theory advanced in this book starts from the position that by its very nature, military
[01:39:07] incompetence cannot be attributed to the dullness of intellect.
[01:39:10] We've hammered that point home.
[01:39:12] There is.
[01:39:13] It seems a reoccurring pattern to military messaps, which defies any explanation in terms
[01:39:16] of the bloody full theory.
[01:39:17] So these people aren't stupid.
[01:39:20] It is, and instead is tentatively suggested that the syndrome occurs through the enormous
[01:39:27] difficulties of professionalizing the instinctual activity of interest species aggression.
[01:39:33] This professionalism entails the growth of militarism, that collection of rules and conventions
[01:39:41] whereby hostility is controlled and anxiety reduced.
[01:39:45] So you've got this system set up to put command in place to reduce anxiety to overcome
[01:39:53] some natural instincts.
[01:39:55] That's what the military set up to do.
[01:39:58] Not surprisingly, a military career attracts a minority of people with these sort of anxieties
[01:40:04] within a military organization.
[01:40:06] Their neurotic needs are gratified.
[01:40:07] They, for their part, help to reinforce those very aspects of militarism, which are so
[01:40:12] congealed to their requirements in return as it were for fitting in so well.
[01:40:17] They may rise to positions of considerable power once they become incapacitated by the very
[01:40:23] characteristics, which hasten to their assent.
[01:40:26] You come in, you're authoritarian, you love it.
[01:40:28] You come in because you're authoritarian and you want to fit into that, then you get in there
[01:40:32] and you're gratified because that in your advance because you're authoritarian.
[01:40:37] And if you make it all the way up, the chain of command, the very authoritarian traits
[01:40:41] that you have are actually a disaster.
[01:40:45] So this is a horrible thing.
[01:40:48] And it took me six podcasts to get that out.
[01:40:52] So much for a theory based on past history.
[01:40:55] Has it, and he kind of goes, okay, look, I've showed you all these examples, which this book,
[01:40:59] 450 pages of this book is examples.
[01:41:02] But he says so much for this theory based on a past history.
[01:41:06] Has it any relevance for the future?
[01:41:07] Since armies and navies have changed out of all recognition, perhaps the sorts of military
[01:41:14] incompetence described in these pages are no longer likely to occur.
[01:41:19] In fact, the evidence suggests this to be a foreloin hope.
[01:41:23] So this shit still happens.
[01:41:25] Some of the same sorts of mistakes occur now as blighted the lives of soldiers 100 years
[01:41:30] ago.
[01:41:31] In Vietnam, in three weeks, in 1968, the Ted offense of a lone cost of the Americans 500
[01:41:37] dead in the South Vietnamese, 165,000 dead with 2 million refugees.
[01:41:42] Why did it happen?
[01:41:43] One reason was the inability to respond to unexpected military intelligence.
[01:41:50] Fast forward a little bit.
[01:41:51] Any doubts as to whether the three factors of remote control.
[01:41:55] He goes into a thing explaining how some of the changes that have taken place.
[01:41:59] One of them is remote control meaning we're now radios.
[01:42:01] We can micromanage people out on the battlefield.
[01:42:03] We make these big swollen staffs and all kinds of weaponry.
[01:42:08] Has this helped?
[01:42:10] Now do we have multiple people on a staff?
[01:42:12] Maybe they can help sort through some of these people that are incompetent.
[01:42:15] Or we have the power to see what's happening on the battlefield.
[01:42:18] Maybe we can make adjustments through remote control.
[01:42:22] We've got all these resources and weapons.
[01:42:23] Maybe that helps.
[01:42:24] So here's what he said.
[01:42:25] It doesn't help.
[01:42:26] He says any doubts to whether these three factors for remote control, swollen staffs and
[01:42:29] the wealth of resources made for incompetence are removed by the contemplation of Vietnam.
[01:42:34] In this most ill-conceived and horrible of wars, there was the commander in chief, Lyndon
[01:42:39] Johnson, aided by his advisors, dreaming of policies and even selecting targets at a nice
[01:42:46] safe distance of 12,000 miles.
[01:42:49] And there was the man on the spot, General West Moreland, a by no means unintelligent military
[01:42:55] commander, but be muzed by the sheer weight of destructive energy and aggressive notion
[01:43:01] supplied by his president.
[01:43:03] Together the Maca-Villian mind of the one coupled with the traditional military mind
[01:43:09] of the other produced a pattern of martial lunacy.
[01:43:13] So abject and appalling that it eventually did for both of them.
[01:43:18] Like the Boor leaders, a half-century earlier, earlier, the versatile General G-Op, this
[01:43:23] is the Vietnamese, North Vietnamese commander and his commander in chief, a little old man
[01:43:28] with a wispy beard.
[01:43:29] Ho Chi Minh made a huge professionally trained and over-equipped army of their enemies
[01:43:34] look utterly ridiculous and their leaders helplessly.
[01:43:37] I rate unfettered by traditional militarism, lacking in excessive brute force and without
[01:43:42] an obsession with capturing real estate, whole and job relied on poor men's strategy.
[01:43:50] Surprise deception and the ability to melt away, they relied on the fact that West Moreland
[01:43:54] would expand, expand his energies, swatting wherever they had last been heard of while they
[01:44:00] got ready to sting in somewhere else.
[01:44:07] Yeah, and it's one of the most fascinating thing, and when we covered General Mouse,
[01:44:12] like little red book, one thing that's so fascinating about this is what the communists
[01:44:18] do to win wars is utilize decentralized command and they do it great and then for the way
[01:44:23] they run their government, they decide to make it a foritary and in centralized, which
[01:44:27] is crazy, which is crazy, and that's exactly what that spells out right there.
[01:44:34] When we're in battle, decentralized command make things happen, small units out there acting
[01:44:39] independently with freedom, and then for the government, guess what, we're locking
[01:44:43] it all down, you're going to obey obey obey.
[01:44:48] This brings up yet another hazard of modern war, government by committee.
[01:44:54] Take the decision to invade Cuba with a group of crew, Cuban excitals, Bay of Pigs, and
[01:44:58] approving the CIA plan Kennedy and his advisors made six assumptions each was wrong.
[01:45:02] They assumed that no one would guess the US government was responsible for the invasion,
[01:45:06] and they're contempt for the Cuban Air Force, they assumed it would be annihilated before
[01:45:10] the invasion began.
[01:45:11] They assumed that the small invasion force led by unpopular ex-offices from the best
[01:45:16] teaser regime would be more than a match for Castro's quote, week army of 20,000 well-cooked
[01:45:21] Cuban troops, they assumed that the invasion would touch off a general revolt behind Castro's
[01:45:26] line, they assumed that even if unsuccessful in their primary objective, the ex-IL forces,
[01:45:31] the ex-IL force could hold up in Cuban reinforced anti-Castro guerrillas.
[01:45:38] What's their plan? Do assumption, assumption, assumption, assumption, and the event that
[01:45:42] each assumption proved a gross, in the event, each assumption proved a gross miscalculation.
[01:45:47] Nothing went as planned.
[01:45:48] Nobody believed the CIA covered story that ships carrying reserve ammunition for the invasion
[01:45:53] force failed to arrive.
[01:45:54] Two were sunk in two fled by the second day, and the invaders were surrounded by Castro's
[01:45:59] army and by the third day they were either dead or behind bars.
[01:46:01] Seven months later, the United States recovered what was left of their invasion force
[01:46:04] for a ransom price to Castro of $53 million, Kennedy was stricken.
[01:46:10] How could I have been so stupid as to let them go ahead he asked?
[01:46:15] As Sornson wrote, his anguish was doubly deepened by the knowledge that the rest of the
[01:46:19] world was asking the same question.
[01:46:21] Arthur Slesinger, Jr., noted that Kennedy would sometimes refer incredulously to the Bay
[01:46:27] of Pigs, wondering how irrational and responsible government could have big common involved
[01:46:32] in so an ill-start adventure.
[01:46:39] Sonded is 77, 7, 1941 had been set aside by Admiral Kimmel Commander Chief of the
[01:46:44] Pacific Fleet for a friendly game of golf with his colleague General Short.
[01:46:50] 96 of his ships, the American Fleet slept at anchor in the harbor American plane, stood
[01:46:56] a wing-tipped wing-tipped on the tarmac, American servicemen were off duty and doing weekend
[01:47:01] leave by the end of the day, Pearl Harbor with the ships planes and military installations
[01:47:05] had been reduced to smoking ruins, 2000 service men have been killed and many more wounded
[01:47:09] are missing.
[01:47:11] By the end of the day, Kimmel was offering to resign.
[01:47:14] Later he was court-martialed, reprimanded and demoted to a position where he's never
[01:47:17] again required to make decisions of any consequence.
[01:47:20] Pearl Harbor, like the Bay of Pigs, confirmed once again that military incompetence is
[01:47:24] more often a product of personality characteristics than of intellectual shortcomings.
[01:47:33] For these American disasters show very clearly that even combined intellect and specialized
[01:47:40] knowledge of highly intelligent and dedicated men are no proof against decision so totally
[01:47:46] unrealistic and subsequently to tax the credually of even those who had made them.
[01:47:52] Far from diminishing the chances of an aptitude, the group actually accentuates the effects
[01:48:00] of those very traits which may lead to incompetence in individual commanders.
[01:48:08] So you get a group together and you'd think that this would kind of cancel out and say,
[01:48:13] hey, heck, I don't have that's a good idea.
[01:48:15] No, it actually gets worse.
[01:48:16] It turns into groupthink.
[01:48:17] The symptoms of this process, which Janice terms groupthink include, one, and illusion of
[01:48:25] invulnerability that becomes shared by most members of the group.
[01:48:30] Two, collective attempts to ignore rationalize a way, items of information which might
[01:48:37] otherwise leave the group to reconsider shaky but cherish assumptions.
[01:48:41] Three, an unquestion belief in the groups inherent morality, busson-nabling members to overlook
[01:48:47] ethical consequences of their decision.
[01:48:51] Four, stereotyping the enemy as either too evil from negotiation or too stupid and
[01:48:57] feeble to be a threat.
[01:49:01] You can see, you can hear this happening in the room, right?
[01:49:04] You can hear the discussions happening.
[01:49:06] A shared illusion of unenemity in a majority viewpoint augmented by the false assumption
[01:49:13] that silence means consent and six self-appointed mind guards to protect the group from adverse
[01:49:24] information that might shatter complacency about the effectiveness and morality of their decisions.
[01:49:33] That's what happens when you put a bunch of people that have these tendencies into a group
[01:49:40] together, it gets a worse.
[01:49:45] This is the last thing I'm going to read from the book here.
[01:49:49] Finally, it is worth noting that the personality determined malaise of groupthink produces
[01:49:56] once again those four most frequently occurring symptoms of past military incompetence,
[01:50:03] wastage of manpower.
[01:50:05] Everconfidence under estimation of the enemy and ignoring of intelligence reports, these
[01:50:16] it seems are the enduring hazards of professionalizing violence.
[01:50:26] And I can tell you these are not only the hazards of professionalizing violence, these
[01:50:30] are the enduring hazards for us as human beings, as leaders, that we can all fall into.
[01:50:39] And as you pointed out, this book is a big warning of what not to do.
[01:50:44] I got it, I said it was the last thing I'm going to read, but there's a, look, this guy's
[01:50:47] funny and I did a bad job of relaying some of this humor.
[01:50:51] Here's the after word of this book.
[01:50:54] And then this is the last thing I'm going to read from this book after six podcasts.
[01:50:57] He says, this is so British.
[01:51:02] He says, let's the readers should have doubted my qualifications to write this book.
[01:51:06] Let me assure him that I have marked authoritarian traits a week ago, fear of failure
[01:51:13] motivation and no illusions about the fact that I would have made a grossly incompetent
[01:51:20] general.
[01:51:21] It takes one to no one.
[01:51:24] That was from the author in 1935.
[01:51:26] A little bit of humor.
[01:51:27] And he says it takes one to no one.
[01:51:32] But that's unfortunately not true.
[01:51:34] It's unfortunately not true.
[01:51:37] If you think you're incompetent, there's a better chance that you're not incompetent.
[01:51:45] You can see where I'm going this.
[01:51:47] If you think you're incompetent, there's a better chance that you're not incompetent.
[01:51:50] Because if you think you're incompetent, you're actually humble and you're thinking, ooh,
[01:51:54] I don't know if I need to listen to one of the people I have to say, I need to check myself.
[01:52:00] I need to learn, I need to open my mind and see what other information I can grab
[01:52:03] or because I've got to feel like I might be incompetent.
[01:52:07] If you feel like it's kind of when people ask me about the imposter syndrome, what if
[01:52:12] I'm impostering it?
[01:52:13] Good.
[01:52:14] That means you're actually thinking, man, do I even believe need to be?
[01:52:16] I always had that.
[01:52:17] I always felt like, oh man, if I'm going to need to be making decisions, I better do my
[01:52:21] homework.
[01:52:22] I better think this through a better pay attention.
[01:52:26] So if you think you're incompetent, you probably aren't.
[01:52:30] But if you've been listening to these six straight podcasts and you've been thinking
[01:52:35] that this book is about all the incompetent leaders around you, that's the little warning
[01:52:38] sign.
[01:52:40] Be careful because if you are in that mindset where you think, man, I can't believe how
[01:52:46] jacked up all these other leaders are.
[01:52:49] So not you, red flag because chances are, this is about you.
[01:52:58] And look, here's the other red flag.
[01:53:00] It's a scale, right?
[01:53:01] You brought that up.
[01:53:02] It's a continuum.
[01:53:06] And so we all of us, even if you feel like you're pretty competent, you are under threat
[01:53:12] of being dragged to incompetency.
[01:53:15] So all these little, this book is just a warning sign after a warning sign after a warning
[01:53:18] sign and by the way, there's nothing new.
[01:53:22] There's almost nothing new.
[01:53:23] There's one thing that I said, that's a new thought to me.
[01:53:25] I forget what it was.
[01:53:26] But in these 400 pages and whatever we just did 12, 15 hours worth of podcasts, it's
[01:53:32] all, it's a rehash.
[01:53:33] It's a reinforcement of information that I already knew that we already knew that we
[01:53:37] talk about all the time, that we've seen it a bunch of other situations.
[01:53:42] It's a rehash.
[01:53:43] But we're all getting, we can all get pulled, over there, we can get pulled towards
[01:53:51] that authoritarian mindset.
[01:53:52] Because, you know why we get pulled towards the authoritarian mindset?
[01:53:54] We get pulled towards that authoritarian mindset because it seems easier.
[01:53:59] It seems easier to say, shut up and do what I told you to do.
[01:54:01] It seems easier to say, you know what?
[01:54:02] I'm not going to listen to that piece of information.
[01:54:05] It seems easier to do that.
[01:54:07] It seems like the right move.
[01:54:10] It seems easier to say, you know what?
[01:54:12] The competitor's never going to be able to do what we're doing.
[01:54:15] It seems easier and it's not.
[01:54:20] So you got to get watched.
[01:54:21] You got to watch out.
[01:54:22] You got to pay attention.
[01:54:23] You got to be careful.
[01:54:24] We all have to be on guard in competence.
[01:54:26] In competence is out there sort of ready to attach.
[01:54:28] It's ready to attach.
[01:54:29] Yes.
[01:54:30] And if you're not on guard, it'll grab you.
[01:54:32] It'll pull you down and you'll be making bad decisions and getting people killed or ruining
[01:54:36] your business or ruining your marriage or ruining your life through incompetence.
[01:54:41] So we have to pay attention.
[01:54:43] You got to be careful.
[01:54:46] We got to stay on the path.
[01:54:47] Yes.
[01:54:48] The path.
[01:54:49] Speaking of where it's, you know?
[01:54:52] What do you got for us?
[01:54:53] How do you advise?
[01:54:54] We avoid incompetence.
[01:54:56] We avoid incompetence.
[01:54:57] Mental incompetence.
[01:54:58] Leadership incompetence.
[01:54:59] Physical incompetence.
[01:55:00] Physical incompetence.
[01:55:01] We don't want to have that.
[01:55:04] What do you got for us?
[01:55:05] Second trial.
[01:55:06] Because the Dunning Kruger effect that you kind of referred to, where the, it takes one
[01:55:12] to know on that's not necessarily true.
[01:55:15] Yeah, that it feels like when you, you think you know everything.
[01:55:20] It's like it's easy to know everything when you think there's only like three or four things
[01:55:24] to know.
[01:55:25] But then when you start due to it and you're like, man, once I know how to stop that
[01:55:29] on lock, I'll be good.
[01:55:30] Kind of be it.
[01:55:31] Yeah.
[01:55:32] Because you got on lock three times.
[01:55:33] Yeah.
[01:55:34] You're in a random, you know, blue belt, you're like, oh, dude, I'm gonna stop that.
[01:55:37] And then you get your toe figured it out.
[01:55:39] And you feel like I'm not gonna stop the choke.
[01:55:40] Then you know, heel hook.
[01:55:41] Yeah, I do.
[01:55:42] I'm not gonna stop that heel hook.
[01:55:43] Yeah, just goes on.
[01:55:44] Yeah.
[01:55:45] Yeah, so the guy who actually does stop after like you get heel hooked, armedlocked, a
[01:55:49] zeeke heel choked, freaking.
[01:55:51] Then you go, oh, there's a lot more.
[01:55:52] I don't know what I'm doing.
[01:55:53] Yes.
[01:55:54] So it's a minute to convince you of that.
[01:55:56] Yeah.
[01:55:57] So that's when you kind of, when the, it's all the Dunning Kruger effect.
[01:56:02] It's essentially like, yeah, when you think you people who are like so confident, they're
[01:56:06] the ones that know less than the people who are like not confident at all because they know
[01:56:09] how much there is not to know.
[01:56:10] You know, they have a grasp on it or whatever.
[01:56:12] Yeah, Dave, good deal, Dave.
[01:56:14] Said something.
[01:56:15] I forget his exact words, but I wish I remembered it.
[01:56:18] It was something like, oh, yeah, when he's talking about you, you're just a, he was like,
[01:56:22] um, yeah, it's almost like you get, you learn what he said.
[01:56:26] It's almost like you get worse over time.
[01:56:28] Because yesterday there was only three things I didn't know.
[01:56:31] Like now there's like 40 things that don't know.
[01:56:33] I don't know.
[01:56:34] There's a thousand.
[01:56:35] Yeah.
[01:56:36] With a day that you start to look, start to feel okay as when you go, oh, there's
[01:56:40] an infinite number of things.
[01:56:41] Yeah.
[01:56:42] I just don't know anything.
[01:56:43] Yeah.
[01:56:44] Take a look.
[01:56:45] Well, so we want to know stuff.
[01:56:47] Hey, complacency, right?
[01:56:49] complacency.
[01:56:50] That's one of the deals.
[01:56:51] It's like your whole brain and body, but brain, trying to, trying to like be lazy for
[01:57:00] lack of a better term, like I said before, trying to save energy, trying to save work,
[01:57:05] like when you do more work or less work.
[01:57:07] Yep.
[01:57:08] She was saying it's like a Rubik's cube.
[01:57:10] You're, are you good at Rubik's cube?
[01:57:12] Yeah.
[01:57:13] You are.
[01:57:14] Yeah, you know the formula.
[01:57:15] Yep, I know all the algorithms to get the sides, termed up, right?
[01:57:19] This good.
[01:57:20] Well, let's say you didn't.
[01:57:21] Well, actually, not just kid riding on your room.
[01:57:23] That kind of surprised me when I was like, damn, all right.
[01:57:28] That's like if you say new how to play the piano.
[01:57:30] But it is an algorithm.
[01:57:31] Yeah, yeah.
[01:57:32] Yeah, yeah.
[01:57:33] Yeah, yeah.
[01:57:34] It's like a little like a literature.
[01:57:35] A little steps.
[01:57:36] Yes, yes, exactly right.
[01:57:37] Like yeah, it's a little formula for sure.
[01:57:39] But whether you know the formula or not, I would imagine that, let's say you got that
[01:57:43] thing figured out.
[01:57:44] Right.
[01:57:45] But then on one side, you got that one freaking different color on the side.
[01:57:51] Just the one, you know that's not just one move.
[01:57:53] That's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know,
[01:57:57] you know, there's like, oh, you know the formula.
[01:57:59] It was like 13 moves, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,
[01:58:02] left left up to two, two, five.
[01:58:03] But it would imagine it would be like multiples of four for some reason.
[01:58:06] I don't know why I think that could be right.
[01:58:08] Could be wrong.
[01:58:09] There's the deal.
[01:58:10] Let me ask you this.
[01:58:11] What, you know, I was the kid and when we were, we just creeped came out.
[01:58:15] It took me like no less than, you know, 15 minutes to figure out how to break that thing
[01:58:19] apart.
[01:58:20] Oh, yeah, assemble it in the correct order.
[01:58:21] Yeah.
[01:58:22] And then actually, that's smart to do in a couple of, yeah.
[01:58:25] It's creative.
[01:58:26] Put it this way.
[01:58:27] Yeah, that's the thing.
[01:58:28] This might, I'm not saying you were creative because I don't know.
[01:58:31] But you seem like the type, you didn't do it out of creativity.
[01:58:34] You did it just out of like brute-fucking jacco.
[01:58:38] Yes.
[01:58:39] But when you break it, that's not the night.
[01:58:41] I just broke jacco.
[01:58:42] It's just like, hey, yeah, I'm going to solve this problem.
[01:58:45] It's direct way I can.
[01:58:47] But if you look at those rules, you take it all apart.
[01:58:51] It the last pieces, those center pieces, kind of tell a little bit of a story.
[01:58:55] Yeah.
[01:58:56] You can, they're stuck there.
[01:58:58] But no, I think you take them out.
[01:59:00] You could pop off like this little star thing.
[01:59:02] Yeah, yeah, it would make less sense.
[01:59:03] Exactly.
[01:59:04] That's what I'm saying.
[01:59:05] It tells a little story there.
[01:59:06] So you're like, oh, I see, then maybe, I don't know what you do to then put them back
[01:59:11] together.
[01:59:12] Here's another way to do it.
[01:59:14] All the colors are little stickers.
[01:59:16] Oh, God.
[01:59:17] Yeah.
[01:59:18] The last brute wave doing that a little bit more sophisticated.
[01:59:20] It is.
[01:59:21] I don't know.
[01:59:22] So you got like glue all over your freaking hands.
[01:59:24] I didn't say it was perfect to you.
[01:59:26] And then say it was perfect.
[01:59:27] Either way, that's the frustration.
[01:59:29] You got it all figured out.
[01:59:30] You're going to use it for like, in seconds.
[01:59:32] Yeah, the way.
[01:59:33] Oh, yeah.
[01:59:34] You're going to use it for like a second.
[01:59:35] So Rubius Cube is what?
[01:59:36] It's nine on each side, right?
[01:59:38] Right?
[01:59:39] You're seeing those ones with like, freaking like 64 squares on each side or whatever.
[01:59:44] I have not.
[01:59:45] They're not.
[01:59:46] And guys will do them too.
[01:59:47] In like a time lapse or whatever.
[01:59:49] Nonetheless, you see my point.
[01:59:51] No, I have no idea what you think you got.
[01:59:54] You think you got things figured out in life.
[01:59:56] Then you get this one lone idea that kind of jams up your whole way of thinking.
[02:00:01] Just that one.
[02:00:03] It's way easier to take off that sticker or maybe just turn it to the side where you can't
[02:00:08] see that thing.
[02:00:09] It's way easier.
[02:00:10] Okay.
[02:00:11] Safe way, way more energy.
[02:00:13] But the reality is the correct thing to do is, bro, you got to know that algorithm,
[02:00:17] the formula.
[02:00:18] It's going to take some steps and take some more work.
[02:00:21] But at the end of the day, you're going to have a correct.
[02:00:22] That's what I think.
[02:00:23] Okay.
[02:00:24] It's the 100% wrong.
[02:00:25] And that's what you got to think in a way.
[02:00:27] So amazing.
[02:00:28] Like it's even your attitude right now is telling me that you might be feeling the effects
[02:00:35] of the what he called, well, how'd you put it, like slipping off the path?
[02:00:39] You know, my mind is so close to your freaking metaphors right now.
[02:00:42] Let's ridiculous.
[02:00:44] Anyway, we're working out.
[02:00:46] It's squat season.
[02:00:47] By the way, I heard my apparently it's squat season.
[02:00:50] Back to squat.
[02:00:51] That's the worst.
[02:00:52] So we're on the path.
[02:00:53] Stay in there.
[02:00:54] The beginning of squat season, the beginning of any physical related season.
[02:00:58] If there's any more in squat season, it's going to be painful, especially the beginning.
[02:01:04] If you go snowboarding the first day of snowboarding season, that day you're going to have
[02:01:09] dawn.
[02:01:10] It should be sore.
[02:01:11] It seems like anyway.
[02:01:12] My point is you're going to need some supplementation here and there.
[02:01:15] You know, it's no problem.
[02:01:16] We got some for you.
[02:01:17] Jocco has some for you.
[02:01:18] Jocco feel.
[02:01:19] That was a long wrap.
[02:01:20] Let's start with the energy drinks.
[02:01:23] See, this is not seasonal.
[02:01:25] This is your own energy drink.
[02:01:27] But not the tradition energy drink.
[02:01:30] This is a healthy energy drink.
[02:01:33] Energy health drink.
[02:01:34] Whatever you want to call it.
[02:01:35] All upside no downside.
[02:01:36] All healthy for you.
[02:01:37] You'll be healthier after you drink one or two.
[02:01:40] Seems same.
[02:01:41] By the way, there's a new pre workout powder formula, which JP to Mel did two dry
[02:01:51] scoops.
[02:01:52] And then the chaser of the sour apple sniper.
[02:01:56] But I did, I was talking to my daughter today.
[02:02:00] And she just did her first experience on the new powder, the new go powder.
[02:02:07] And while I was talking to her, she was on the roller.
[02:02:10] She didn't see to get net pole on poles.
[02:02:13] Chain out.
[02:02:14] Get that chain out, this her.
[02:02:16] And she was saying as she in between breaths that I won't even have.
[02:02:22] I wrote it in.
[02:02:23] But I took the go.
[02:02:25] It freaking hit.
[02:02:28] And that is a real thing.
[02:02:29] That's a real thing.
[02:02:30] Yeah.
[02:02:31] And I was an mention this before offline, where I'm no stranger to the jittery pre workout
[02:02:38] powders.
[02:02:39] I'm not scared of that kind of stuff.
[02:02:42] And in fact, you get the jitteres or whatever all that stuff.
[02:02:45] To me, that's no factor.
[02:02:46] And in fact, when you're tired and the jitteres hit you, I'd rather have jitteres than
[02:02:50] to be fired up to work out than not have jitteres than not be fired up.
[02:02:53] So I'm like, I'm not scared of that kind of stuff, right?
[02:02:56] And our jitter's necessary, though, that's the thing.
[02:02:59] That seems like we've discovered that we don't need them.
[02:03:01] I didn't even think about that stuff.
[02:03:03] To me, that's just what the pre workout was.
[02:03:05] Good.
[02:03:06] I'll take all of it, whatever you do whatever.
[02:03:09] But it is.
[02:03:10] And I read our realises.
[02:03:11] Because I heard people say like, oh yeah, you drink this like tea.
[02:03:13] They'd say this about some teas.
[02:03:14] Like yeah, you're up, but it's like a smooth or whatever.
[02:03:17] The smoothness or whatever.
[02:03:18] I'm like cool man, smoothness.
[02:03:20] Oh, good.
[02:03:21] Whatever.
[02:03:22] It just wasn't part of my world until I got the experience.
[02:03:25] So the pre workout I took it, my cool thing is I haven't been doing pre workout for
[02:03:28] like years now.
[02:03:30] So I took this one.
[02:03:31] I was like cool.
[02:03:32] No jitteres, so I'm thinking, maybe juck was just sort of scared of the pre workout
[02:03:35] experience.
[02:03:36] I get it, you know, a little bit more mild.
[02:03:38] I get it man, I get it.
[02:03:40] But when you start warming up, that's when you feel it.
[02:03:43] Like that when everything starts flowing, it's like it connects your brain to your freaking
[02:03:47] body more or something.
[02:03:48] That's a body experience.
[02:03:49] That's what I'm saying.
[02:03:50] Let me know in in in body experience.
[02:03:53] Nonetheless, what I'm saying is what your daughter was talking about, I understand.
[02:04:01] And it's true.
[02:04:03] And yeah, I think it had to reevaluate my whole standard of the pre workout.
[02:04:08] Because I knew like the pre workout I said I was taking, that's not good.
[02:04:11] That's why I stopped.
[02:04:12] Yeah.
[02:04:13] Because I'm like cool, it's working, but probably I know I'm jamming myself out
[02:04:17] of my heart.
[02:04:18] I don't know what I'm jamming up on the inside.
[02:04:19] But I'm jamming something up.
[02:04:20] And yeah, man, now I know the new standard.
[02:04:24] So you can get it that you can get your super hard workouts with a little extra kick.
[02:04:31] Which might mean you need to protect yourself from a joint perspective a little bit more.
[02:04:36] Let's go join warfare.
[02:04:37] Let's go super curl.
[02:04:39] Might as well keep your immunity in check because we're starting to work hard getting
[02:04:45] like a needing recovery.
[02:04:48] What, maybe the immune system's taking a little hit will get a little boost from some
[02:04:52] cold war, some vitamin B3.
[02:04:55] Kind of got you covered.
[02:04:56] Yeah, you know, when you kind of like go down the list, you kind of like, it's a whole system.
[02:05:00] Really.
[02:05:01] And it's not the kind of like, like, I don't want to say useless because I don't want
[02:05:05] to like put, put that kind of stigma on other types of supplements.
[02:05:10] But it's like a whole system to stay very solidly like on the path.
[02:05:16] And then you get on them.
[02:05:17] We know we're kind of in squat season apparently.
[02:05:19] But then you can be in squat season, which means you might want to get on board the
[02:05:24] malt train.
[02:05:25] Yes, sir.
[02:05:26] Because you're going to need to he build from your activities.
[02:05:29] Oh, yeah.
[02:05:30] It's got activities.
[02:05:31] So I, Scott, Scott, to this area.
[02:05:35] I, two stakes the other day.
[02:05:38] Concurrently like why?
[02:05:39] Yeah, in one mirror, in one meal, just takes brown rice.
[02:05:42] Because why would you just have one big stake?
[02:05:45] Well, they were two medium stakes.
[02:05:47] Okay.
[02:05:48] I don't know.
[02:05:49] That's the size you buy at the store.
[02:05:50] Oh, yeah.
[02:05:51] Oh, yeah.
[02:05:52] I mean, maybe I could have went to the body, but you know, and I, that didn't happen.
[02:05:58] How many ounces were you thinking?
[02:06:00] What's the medium regular one?
[02:06:01] You know, I have the thin one, the revised, right?
[02:06:03] You have the thin, the buys.
[02:06:04] And you have the super those super fat ones that you get from the guy behind the counter.
[02:06:07] And then you have the regular medium ones.
[02:06:09] Okay.
[02:06:10] Yeah, two of those.
[02:06:11] Two of the mediums.
[02:06:12] Which was a lot.
[02:06:13] Normally, it just happened.
[02:06:15] Oh, my cool.
[02:06:16] I needed some additional protein.
[02:06:17] That's why came home late.
[02:06:19] Didn't eat all day.
[02:06:20] I was only having one meal, so I needed to double up on the protein.
[02:06:22] Had to.
[02:06:23] Hmm.
[02:06:24] Some same brown rice.
[02:06:25] But can't be doing that every day.
[02:06:27] Some same.
[02:06:28] I'm just saying it's not convenient.
[02:06:29] And also, let's face it when you get done.
[02:06:31] You still, these eye.
[02:06:34] Even with the most dose rib eyes.
[02:06:36] Yeah.
[02:06:37] I can still get done with two rib eyes.
[02:06:39] Marbled tasty.
[02:06:40] Good.
[02:06:41] Good.
[02:06:42] Good.
[02:06:43] Yeah.
[02:06:44] I can still get done and want to have dessert.
[02:06:47] What?
[02:06:48] Now, what am I going to have for dessert?
[02:06:51] Could I have something that is negates my physical progress?
[02:06:55] I could.
[02:06:56] Or I could just have milk.
[02:06:58] Yeah.
[02:06:59] That's one more step forward, you mean?
[02:07:00] Oh, man.
[02:07:01] So good.
[02:07:02] Once it hits the lips, bro.
[02:07:04] It's so good.
[02:07:06] Thank you, Joko, for the lips.
[02:07:09] Thing.
[02:07:10] That's from a movie.
[02:07:11] You should have picked up on that.
[02:07:12] I'll pick up on that.
[02:07:13] No, bro.
[02:07:14] I like that is the imagery of your lips.
[02:07:16] No, that's it.
[02:07:17] That's a Frank the Tank, man.
[02:07:19] And what movies it?
[02:07:21] K dog.
[02:07:22] Oh, it's cool.
[02:07:23] It's cool.
[02:07:24] Yeah.
[02:07:25] He's talking about beer.
[02:07:26] Like a beer funnel.
[02:07:27] What is it called?
[02:07:28] The beer funnel.
[02:07:29] Beer.
[02:07:30] Beer.
[02:07:31] Yeah.
[02:07:32] Beer.
[02:07:33] Yeah.
[02:07:34] Beer.
[02:07:35] He's so good.
[02:07:36] Once it hits the lips, it's kind of like milk.
[02:07:38] It's the same feeling.
[02:07:39] It's so good.
[02:07:40] Once it hits the lips, you just, yes, or.
[02:07:42] Same thing.
[02:07:43] I understand, fully.
[02:07:44] But I think that's the new thing.
[02:07:45] Get a grass fed, bison, rib, by smaller.
[02:07:48] But, bro, it's kind of a dream.
[02:07:50] Well, actually, the thing, you know, over at other people's houses right now is actually
[02:07:53] milk.
[02:07:54] All right.
[02:07:55] That's right.
[02:07:56] Yeah, that's right.
[02:07:57] Yeah, that's good.
[02:07:58] Yeah, that's good.
[02:07:59] Yeah, that's good.
[02:08:00] Yeah, that's good.
[02:08:01] Out there, just, you know, you know, exactly where it came from.
[02:08:05] Just elk in and up.
[02:08:06] Yep.
[02:08:07] Good.
[02:08:08] We're there at the moment of truth.
[02:08:09] Yeah.
[02:08:10] Did it?
[02:08:11] Good.
[02:08:12] So, in the event of you not having elk in your freezer, in the case, maybe from your
[02:08:18] hunt, as the case, maybe or double rib eyes at any given moment or bison steak.
[02:08:25] Right.
[02:08:26] You want some additional protein?
[02:08:27] Mulk chain all day.
[02:08:28] Mulk chain.
[02:08:29] Hey, you can get all this stuff at jockelfield.com.
[02:08:32] If you subscribe to it, the shipping's free.
[02:08:33] You can get the drinks out.
[02:08:34] Wow.
[02:08:35] Yeah, sure.
[02:08:36] You can get all of it at vitamin shop.
[02:08:39] We appreciate those, those stores carrying this stuff.
[02:08:41] Because look, you might want to roll in there.
[02:08:44] Yeah, it's really rolling there.
[02:08:45] Roll in there.
[02:08:46] Roll in a wall.
[02:08:47] Get yourself a hogey and a go.
[02:08:50] I didn't really know what a hogey was.
[02:08:51] By the way, is that a East Coast thing or what?
[02:08:54] Yes.
[02:08:55] Yes.
[02:08:56] There's a whole bunch of names for that particular subway sandwich.
[02:08:58] Sub sandwich.
[02:08:59] Sub sandwich.
[02:09:00] What, you know what we used to call it?
[02:09:02] Where I'm from grinder.
[02:09:03] If you heard that before, it's not.
[02:09:05] It's not.
[02:09:06] My wife, who's from England, would call it a back.
[02:09:09] AP.
[02:09:10] That's not true.
[02:09:11] That's true.
[02:09:12] That's true.
[02:09:13] There's some other ones I think were missing.
[02:09:14] Oh, poor boy, poor boy.
[02:09:15] Poor boy.
[02:09:16] Poor boy.
[02:09:17] That's another one.
[02:09:18] So there's some names out there.
[02:09:20] Yeah, all day.
[02:09:21] Meanwhile.
[02:09:22] Also, also, origin USA.
[02:09:24] This is American-made stuff.
[02:09:25] Look, you get, look, our health is together.
[02:09:28] We know that, Erie.
[02:09:29] We're standing in the path.
[02:09:30] It's not.
[02:09:31] Don't complicit on the path.
[02:09:32] Right?
[02:09:33] Yeah.
[02:09:34] Look.
[02:09:35] You want it as far as a parallel goes.
[02:09:36] We all wear clothes.
[02:09:37] Hopefully.
[02:09:38] Well, maybe we wear clothes.
[02:09:39] Yeah.
[02:09:40] We want some iconic American-made attire denim jeans, boots, some shirts, some other leather
[02:09:51] garalettes, belts, this kind of stuff.
[02:09:54] What if it was all made in America?
[02:09:56] Oh, it is.
[02:09:57] What is it?
[02:09:58] By the way, but you want that bison steak?
[02:10:00] Cool.
[02:10:01] How about that bison boots?
[02:10:02] Oh, yeah.
[02:10:03] Made in America.
[02:10:04] A couple leather.
[02:10:05] We were able to use the terms, so I'll go.
[02:10:07] I think I did one time and I was very uncomfortable.
[02:10:10] Yeah.
[02:10:11] I'm going to use it again right now, describing some bison boots, which are supple.
[02:10:15] All right.
[02:10:16] There you go.
[02:10:17] You heard it here.
[02:10:18] Look, go.
[02:10:19] But yes, but everything made in America from the materials, the raw materials, grown
[02:10:22] in America.
[02:10:23] Everything all the way up to the jeans you wearing on your hips.
[02:10:27] And so you're good 24 hours a day.
[02:10:29] Because you got also, because we're training to jitter, you got your jitter geek.
[02:10:33] You got to rift geeks.
[02:10:34] You're never going to get another kind of geek in.
[02:10:36] Oh, yeah.
[02:10:37] So the whole system is accounted for.
[02:10:39] Yeah.
[02:10:40] So the first thing I did was do the game.
[02:10:41] It's true.
[02:10:42] Or junior say dot com also, jitter, so now you want to go into straight up representing
[02:10:48] on the path like a choice, a contrast choice to represent.
[02:10:53] Is there a psychological hit that you get when you were a little kid?
[02:10:58] You got new sneakers.
[02:10:59] Yes, sir.
[02:11:00] We're running a little bit faster.
[02:11:01] Yes, sir.
[02:11:02] We're on the path.
[02:11:03] We put on a freaking t-shirt that says, dear spleen equals freedom.
[02:11:07] Do we go a little bit harder in the pain?
[02:11:09] Yes, we do.
[02:11:09] So there's a thing that sounds like, oh, that's kind of like funny.
[02:11:12] You're right.
[02:11:13] It's absolutely true.
[02:11:14] And here's the thing, do an experiment.
[02:11:16] The science.
[02:11:17] Where's the wear?
[02:11:19] A shirt or a hoodie or whatever says this will equals freedom.
[02:11:22] Look in the mirror and eat a cookie.
[02:11:23] See how I'm not saying not going to be able to eat the cookies.
[02:11:26] I'm not saying that.
[02:11:27] It's going to be a hard way harder.
[02:11:29] Yes.
[02:11:30] Oh, yeah.
[02:11:31] So now if you're just in your everyday life, but you're representing.
[02:11:34] But the chances of you flipping off the path, even for that moment.
[02:11:38] I actually feel bad we haven't put this word out before.
[02:11:40] Because this is important.
[02:11:41] It's like the same.
[02:11:43] It's kind of important.
[02:11:44] It is.
[02:11:45] Yes, sir.
[02:11:46] It's true.
[02:11:47] It just sort of applies like if you're just representing the general in general,
[02:11:51] it's just that much more efficient way of staying on the path.
[02:11:53] So I'm saying, and let's face it.
[02:11:54] You see somebody else representing your representing this.
[02:11:57] The collegian.
[02:11:58] Right.
[02:11:59] Now we're even stronger together together.
[02:12:01] Also, the shirt locker.
[02:12:03] This is a part of Jocco's store.
[02:12:04] It's a part.
[02:12:05] Choose the sign up for shirt locker. You're going to new shirt every month with.
[02:12:09] Did you change the word?
[02:12:10] Creative designs.
[02:12:11] You said something.
[02:12:12] Well, now there's actually bad ass because the new one that just came out is.
[02:12:16] And it's new.
[02:12:17] It's like a new scenario.
[02:12:20] It's a tank.
[02:12:22] There's kettlebells flying off, which I noticed.
[02:12:26] You did run into the kettlebells.
[02:12:27] There's kettlebells flying through the air.
[02:12:30] I'm riding this tank sort of in a aggressive hospital kind of way.
[02:12:33] We're in a deaf court.
[02:12:34] We're in a deaf court.
[02:12:35] Which I'm wearing right now.
[02:12:36] By the way, maybe I just dismounted my tank and showed up here to tell you his
[02:12:39] forecast.
[02:12:40] Two machine guns.
[02:12:41] Two machine guns.
[02:12:42] And the tank is an M1 Abrams tank.
[02:12:45] By the way.
[02:12:46] So you have a good depiction.
[02:12:49] When it looks like a comic book thing, that's what made it because kind of a
[02:12:51] dope thing.
[02:12:52] Yeah.
[02:12:53] I commend your work there.
[02:12:55] Commended.
[02:12:56] The bad news is that was last month's shirt.
[02:13:02] Like this past month's shirt.
[02:13:04] The good news is when you're signed up as short, long as I don't care if you
[02:13:07] sign up next year, you can still get that shirt if you want.
[02:13:10] If access to that shirt.
[02:13:11] If you signed up.
[02:13:12] So, boom, nowhere is anyway.
[02:13:15] Yeah.
[02:13:16] Jockels.com.
[02:13:17] You want to represent.
[02:13:18] Boom.
[02:13:19] That's where you can get the stuff to represent.
[02:13:20] Speaking of subscription.
[02:13:22] Subscribe to this podcast.
[02:13:23] Don't forget about unravelling podcasts, grounded podcast.
[02:13:25] War your kid podcast.
[02:13:26] I got to ask by kids at Jockel Live, which by the way is Jockel Live in Austin.
[02:13:31] Coming up Saturday night, Austin, Texas, November 20th.
[02:13:37] So, we're going to come to that and ask me questions or hang out or listen to me talk.
[02:13:42] Come check that out, but also where you're kid podcast.
[02:13:45] We also have Jockel on the ground, which again, we have contingency plans.
[02:13:50] We will recently, we will recently shadow ban.
[02:13:55] Shadow ban.
[02:13:56] Yeah, forgot Shadow ban.
[02:13:58] On Instagram.
[02:14:00] We know people going to why.
[02:14:01] Why do you get shadow ban?
[02:14:02] That's the problem.
[02:14:03] We don't know why.
[02:14:04] We have some suspicions.
[02:14:06] We're going to talk about it on the underground.
[02:14:09] I'm going to explain the reasons why I think the Shadow ban might have come.
[02:14:13] I've been on Shadow ban now apparently.
[02:14:15] We have information.
[02:14:19] We do have information.
[02:14:20] We've got troopers in, let's just say, we have a place.
[02:14:24] Something we call access in placement.
[02:14:27] We have people.
[02:14:28] So we will hopefully not let that happen again.
[02:14:31] But look, it can happen.
[02:14:34] And that's where we made Jockel on the ground in case mayhem happens in case we get locked
[02:14:40] down.
[02:14:41] We don't control these platforms that you're listening to this on.
[02:14:44] We do control Jockel on the ground.
[02:14:45] If you want to help support us, it costs $8.18 a month because we appreciate that support
[02:14:51] to have that contingency plan set up.
[02:14:53] We make an extra podcast.
[02:14:55] Jockel on the ground.
[02:14:56] We talk about other subjects.
[02:14:57] We talk about Jockel on the ground.
[02:14:58] If you can't afford it, we still want, we're still, you're still with us.
[02:15:15] You can't afford that $8.18 a month.
[02:15:17] Just email assistance at Jockel on the ground.com.
[02:15:19] We'll get you access to it.
[02:15:20] We have a YouTube channel.
[02:15:23] You can subscribe to that.
[02:15:24] Or you're subscribed to the origin, USA, YouTube channel for some behind the scenes.
[02:15:27] We got an album called Psychological Warfare.
[02:15:30] If you need a little help in a moment of weakness.
[02:15:35] And look, we could make an album where you have a moment of weakness and we pre-press
[02:15:39] of the track.
[02:15:41] And it's echo talking about Rubik's Cube for 15 minutes with no logical meaning behind it.
[02:15:47] That part's incorrect.
[02:15:48] Very much logic.
[02:15:49] Yes.
[02:15:50] But we did.
[02:15:51] We didn't do that.
[02:15:52] Maybe we'll do that.
[02:15:53] People that have more time to overcome their weakness.
[02:15:58] But if you want to get that, go to wherever you get M.P.
[02:15:59] Threes, you can get Psychological Warfare.
[02:16:01] I am the artist.
[02:16:03] Yeah.
[02:16:04] Because this is artist's name.
[02:16:05] Jockel.

[02:16:08] So there you go.

[02:16:10] Dakota Meyer making just awesome stuff.
[02:16:13] He started a distribution company, by the way, is not in Texas.
[02:16:17] I'm investing in his beverage distribution company.
[02:16:20] He started going out proactively delivering Jockel Goal to various stories.
[02:16:26] And now he's got people ordering it.
[02:16:27] Brother, that's an anti-authoritarian is sick.
[02:16:30] My head's freaking Dakota Meyer doing the M.P.
[02:16:33] I'm always going to make things happen.
[02:16:35] You think it's whatever.
[02:16:36] Who's in what?
[02:16:37] There's someone in the way.
[02:16:38] Cool.
[02:16:39] I just outmaneuvered them.
[02:16:40] Oh, there's some distribution company that didn't want to make the connection.
[02:16:43] Oh, cool.
[02:16:44] Dakota Meyer is just in a truck.
[02:16:45] Oh, yeah.
[02:16:47] Making it happen.
[02:16:48] I think he signed up 40 stores right now.
[02:16:50] Oh, my man.
[02:16:51] What?
[02:16:52] Hey, what's going on?
[02:16:53] Oh, I'll figure it out.
[02:16:55] Make it happen.
[02:16:57] So there you go.

[02:17:01] Flipside Canvas.com, going order something cool there.
[02:17:04] Got some books.
[02:17:05] Final spin.
[02:17:06] It's out right now.
[02:17:09] We don't even know what it is.
[02:17:10] Novel poem.
[02:17:12] We know that it brings tears to J.P. to NL, to NL crying in the play.
[02:17:17] And in public, check that out.
[02:17:20] Leadership Strategy and Tax Field Manual, code valuation, protocol, discipline, and
[02:17:23] freedom field manual.
[02:17:24] Way of the word, kid, one, two, three, four.
[02:17:26] Get them freaking books for your kids or kids, as you know.
[02:17:30] It's sort of, if you have the ability to get those books for some kid that you know,
[02:17:36] and you don't, you are, you're not a good person.
[02:17:40] You're not a good person.
[02:17:42] If you know a kid and you don't get them those books, you're not, you're hurting those
[02:17:46] kids.
[02:17:47] This is factual.
[02:17:49] So whatever, I know I've met some really cool people lately.
[02:17:54] I met someone down at the master, GJ2, GJ2 player.
[02:17:58] He's like, oh, I carry way the word, you're kid in my bag.
[02:18:02] Any kid that I meet, they're getting it.
[02:18:04] He's just helping kids worldwide.
[02:18:07] So do that.
[02:18:11] Put it in your bag, carried around.
[02:18:13] You see a kid, you're going to kid, here you go.
[02:18:15] Imagine that.
[02:18:16] You can influence the rest of someone's life by doing that.
[02:18:20] So where the word kid, one, two, three.
[02:18:22] Mike in the dragons.
[02:18:23] Apparently the best, what age group is that?
[02:18:27] Little kids.
[02:18:28] What do you call them?
[02:18:29] Little kids.
[02:18:30] Like post, taught.
[02:18:31] I don't know what they're called.
[02:18:32] That age group is probably the most level.
[02:18:34] Yep.
[02:18:35] Mike in the dragons, get your kids to overcome fear.
[02:18:41] Back worth about face, wrote the forward to that one and honor.

[02:20:18] watching, keeping us safe.
[02:20:20] Thank you for your service and sacrifice and to our police and law enforcement.
[02:20:24] Firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, border patrol, secret
[02:20:29] service, and all first responders.
[02:20:32] Thank you for your service.
[02:20:33] Here at home to keep us safe.
[02:20:36] And everyone else out there may be asking yourself that question if you are possibly incompetent.
[02:20:45] And I hope you're not.
[02:20:48] But how do you avoid being incompetent?
[02:20:50] Number one lesson from this book is something that we talk about all the time.
[02:20:54] Be humble, listen.
[02:20:55] Don't think you know everything because you don't.
[02:21:03] Be humble.
[02:21:04] Keep an open mind.
[02:21:05] The thing that traps your mind, the thing that traps your mind is your mind.
[02:21:15] So pry it open, keep it open and go get after it.
[02:21:21] Until next time, Zekko and Jockel.
