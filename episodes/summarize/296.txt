you got a some people might not like mango probably a small number people some people might not like orange some people might not like sour apple sniper some people might not like jockel Palmer some people might not like whatever so the recommendation is try on try one see what you like yeah let me know but let echo Charles know if his signature flavor is the best well it senses factually the best you love your flavor the best well you ever drink another different kind but just the fact that the military families out there and what they put up with and what they go through and usually I mean in my mind I have to worry more than the people that are than the military themselves so on on top of all this just you know the families that are out there that the the the spouses you know come on down too because like it just get to know other people that are living that life you know I know that might might my wife you know she wasn't around we didn't have any family around like we didn't have any family we lived in California we lived in Virginia Beach I was gone almost the entire time she didn't know anyone she ended up doing what you did which is going to live with my parents for a while and, you know, like, he disappears, you know, like what, that's what I was just thinking like, what was that in your head of like, hey, you know what, he's, you know, he probably is going to see his parents or he's, you know, going to go freaking surfing or whatever he's going to do Like he had everything and, you know, that, that, that made me think of this, you know, Sarah, when you're like talking about Chad and when I've talked to people that, like our art depressed, straight up depressed, their heads in, in like this, their heads in a storm, their heads in like darkness and, and it's really like from the outside, you look at him and you think, oh yeah, well, hey, man, it's, you know, you're in this bad situation, but it's only, it's only just right around you and if you come over here a little bit, you'll be out of the storm, like, come on over, but from their perspective, no matter where they look, it's like darkness and they just see the storm and they don't see that if they can move forward more, they can go a little bit further and they don't see that everybody's on the outside going, hey, like, it's okay, man, it's super sunny and bright and like there's a rainbow over here and everything's cool, just, just, just move over here a little bit It was almost like, like in pictures, it was almost like I'm going to kill you, you know, like that whole like, it just, it's just not like him. I know we don't need quite health and energy drinks in the same thing didn't you still no we do know we do now new era discipline go any different flavors best flavors mango kind of by far to pass and that's like an activity and that's saying a lot because the orange is freaking good you know on the sour out like these are like good flavor they taste good and he had just like collapsed like face first on the bed, kind of like the letter T, like arms out to the side, has his head just side like, like just exhaustion. I don't know though so is it normal like what do you let's say you had a salad like not like a side salad but up a rope us salad you know you stick salad chicken salad whatever what do you drink with that what's the norm what pairs with that that don't say I know you can say water I guess the reason I'm asking you that is because I don't know various conversations in my, I've had in my life with various people at various times and the conversation is something like, you know, you know, that little exploration of wait, I'm worried about him and then there'll be some kind of an explanation like, what do you mean? I think the beauty of it is anybody can do this workout because a step up is not technical, we're not snatching, there's no muscle ups that you know anybody can do a step up and then obviously we scale it and you know you have this huge fitness background, you're well aware not everyone has to do the 20 inch box not everybody has to do that weight but being able to go do a workout and honor of someone in our military that that generally brings people together anyway because they want to kind of pay their humble respects but the potential that it could bring for people to have a conversation whether it's you're doing the step ups and maybe you start to realize in that hour time frame where your brain does go what do you think about you know your struggle the person you're doing it for the friend you lost do you do it with a friend and you guys can talk to each other I mean just the the decompression aspect of it meaning for 30 days like you're just gonna eat nice food and like not do anything not blown anything up or whatever there was and and guys felt I definitely know some guys that got a lot out of going to it clearly there's some shortfalls especially if they find issues and they're like and then that was day one lots of setup you know you can kind of get into the characters a little bit day two stuff starts getting a little bit going sideways day two Deb openly weeping that I can visually watch her crying that's like reading like the some parts of the story that are heavy so final spin if you don't know what that's all about check it out but you know the whole idea of charging that much for jeans like whatever they're doing there like it's not a matter of like hey we got a you know People are caught off guard and I know you mentioned a couple of friends where there was real signs of, you know, hey, not things aren't going good for the individual but a lot of times I hear it's like, you know, there's been some suicides in the seal community where there was no indication at all, at all of any kind. but you know anybody anybody that that served the way that Chad served like the guys I served with you don't want people to walk around depressed after you're gone you want them you you don't want that I also think like a lot of I just think the more we do talk about it the the easier it is for someone else to say me too so if you want to come to that ftx September 20th in 21st we're getting close I'm out of already past that we also have an online training academy called extreme ownership extreme ownership.com where you can learn leadership and keep your leadership edge sharp mm if you want to help service members active and retired their families gold star families I talked a little bit about the hyper bearer chamber today and that's one of the one of the things that mama leaves charity organization does is pay for veterans to go into a city and stay for like 30 days and get 30 days worth of hyper bearer treatments that are so helpful they're even helpful for these kind of injuries that we talked about today if you want to donate or you want to get involved go to america's mighty warriors dot org and if you want more of my pathological pauses or you need more of echoes vacant verbalizations you can find us on the inner webs on twitter on the gram on facebook echoes adecotrails i am at docker one and and once again for chad 1000 x go to chad 1000 x dot com if you want to check out Sarah Sarah's instagram it's Sarah Wilkinson seven and then Jason and everything that he's doing on go rock you want to find out where you can get get involved in that it's a really good stuff check out at go rock and thanks once again to Sarah Wilkinson and Jason McCarthy for joining us today and thanks to both of you for your service and thanks for to both of you for everything that you're doing today to try and help raise awareness and prevent suicide straight up and all the veterans out there you've been through a lot and we just this is going to require something that is not kind of normal this day and age it's going to require us to kind of work together you know like how to support transitioning folks better how to kind of build stronger communities in the real world how to like that's what we need we don't you don't need guys coming out it's it's a form we fill out that basically says what's gonna happen should your husband get killed or or wife your spouse gets killed and everything from who's gonna show a pet your door are they gonna weather uniform is it military honors are they buried are they cremated who's gonna take your kids all all those you know pretty important questions it's kind of sad that when you fill it out so many times it's commonplace I remember the first time I filled it out we mold over these questions for so long and and by the end of the deployments I mean I'm like making dinner and I'm like the no you are going to get that's kind of the nature of going hard same saying no just like and work out just like with anything else but don't worry supplementation will help us all through those dings dance so anyway chocolate supplements a lot more you've seen chocolate supplements so first thing we're going to be compressing you know you made me chuckle a little bit we're trying over here decompression and they can't, they, they don't see it, they don't see it, they can't see it, they can't see it because it's there, that's what they're, that's what's around them and so like, it just causes them to do things that don't make any sense to us because we're looking at him from the outside going, hey, like, no, it's sunny, it's sunny, and they can't see it and it's like trying to convince people, it's almost impossible, it seems almost impossible to try and convince someone that that storm that they see 360 degrees around them, thunder, lightning, winds, that's what they see and to convince them that hey, man, right over here, it's sunny and it's nice beach day and it's 80 degrees and we're gonna, it's okay, they, they can't see it and it's so hard to get them out of that cloud Have you put together technical question here have you put together like a ramp up program for people to do you know two months out do a hundred and then whatever break it down like you know those marathon programming things where yeah there's working the program I mean we were there my flight was late that that afternoon and you guys are still you know there was still a big crew there just like social it was social and so it's not a depressing you know it's not it's not like you just people can't live inside that space forever and so what we're trying to do and what we are doing is bringing people together in the real world not in a shrinks office with the waterfall you know that you don't want to be there and it's like hey you know physical health mental health somehow those are definitely we don't have to study chimpanzees to know that those are definitely tied together and obviously Chad did not suffer from physical but I could tell you his sleep is shit they did a test where they are trying to realize are you the guy that's gonna I'm trying to figure the best way they said this basically are you the guy that's gonna see a problem and respond right away like rapid fire like bull in a china shop are you the guy that's gonna like take a minute assess it right a lot of you can look at you know you can do them harder you can scale them to whatever the the hardest the hardest workout in the history of CrossFit that's ever been done was how she did Chad the first time she went into into their garage and she put on Chad's Rucksack by herself and did Chad so think about that when you're feeling sorry for yourself out there you know because it's a hard workout and it is right and and that's what it's supposed to be everyone's selling easy that that's you don't think about anything when when life's easy except the next easy thing you're going to get right you know I was kind of losing it because you know I already don't like fashion people in the first place now they want to be a person charge 400 because they're trying to they're trying to keep the control the market right trying to keep that thing elevated because they want to charge 450 for their pair of jeans and so it was really telling when we did this in Virginia Beach and and guys it chatted served with showed up you know quietly kind of did the work you know they showed up in the big f9 50s you know it's like yes we're hosting so you know call it a big giant monster start start getting your your train on you got a thousand box steps with a forty five pound rock bro that's a get some evolution that's a get some evolution for sure you know he used to do that I don't know if you know this I mean my my neighbor two doors down is a top gun instructor I mean these things are just normal around us and it's great they're just good people that are just you know this talk about you know the greatest generation coming back to America and just doing great stuff getting educated and working their asses off and building America into America and you know we need more of that So people think they know you and what happens is your friends come and join the gym and I had kind of established at the very beginning like we're friends, but at the same time this is, this is a, you know, a business and you do, if, if you're a team life, you don't talk about it in this gym. So, that idea of we think we know, we think we know what someone's going through, we think we know what's going on in their heads And you know, but if you blow your back out or if you, you know, you get shot or if you do, you know, things that are acceptable injuries, you know, by team room standards of sorts, right? And so I get in the shower and he's sitting on the bathtub and he just had been over and he's got his hands on either side of his head and he's holding this hair and he's kind of like gripping his hair and I kept saying what's wrong, you know, what's going on and he got to talk to me and he just kept saying I don't know. well but the thing is again for your your other parts of your body it's kind of like there's kind of a protocol you can check in and be like okay for the brain so mysterious it's like we can try and we are kind of trying to do that and you know this this came about through that partnership and and you know Chris had called me up and he was like you know nobody knows how to deal with this man everyone wants to deal with it and nobody knows how to deal with it and you know you do all the things I mean there there is a lot of assessment that happens at that place and could be potentially good it told me almost all the things I already knew about him as a spouse I are you know they did personality tests and different stress tests and I mean yes I don't know the scientific sleep lab study for a reason like they're doing what's their thing what are they doing like that thing I think I'll tell you what they're doing they know that people want to buy American made stuff and I can see her she's like laughing she laughing like laughing like laughing at me like nodding her head Yeah, you know, when I, when I kind of started off talking about this, that's the connection that I made as I was like listening to your story hearing it is, you know, we've made all these developments and all these different wars from the problems that the wars cause, right? and but you're just strengthening bonds right you bring people together in the real world this is very counter culture and we're very cool with that you know and a world where kids are grown up text messaging each other to instead of talking instead of sitting in the captain's gap like like we are right now and they absolutely need the individuals that have these kind of attributes that you're talking about and there is absolutely a new mission when you get done with the military to go out in the civilian world and have an impact make people's lives better and build great products and build great companies and and do great things and that is absolutely available and you are needed in the in the civilian world and that's the way it is we need them too all right like our country needs people with this kind of experience spread throughout our our country spread throughout our companies spread throughout our communities spread throughout our our neighborhoods and one of the things that makes San Diego such a great town is it's it's a military there's it's a military town you've got this just underpinnings of San Diego the foundation is strong it's the same where I live in Jacksonville beach So like, you know, we started this in football, you've got the concussion, measurements and if you get a concussion, you've got to come out and you know, if it's your star player, he's still got to come out. So I think, you know, Dave, for his part, I mean, I know he, he wanted to honor Chad and, you know, I think he wanted other people to honor Chad as well. And as you mentioned, people are different and something's in fact different people different ways and he described like there's a cop that people have and, and when it gets filled up with like the stress and the trauma, once it overflows like that's it. but they have like the pocket is kind of it breeds like through so the water can pass through I'm wearing them right now they do have that but that still see but you know what I'm doing right now working I'm paed get their good their excellent for podcast I don't know what you know about the stuff Jason, but they're doing like baseline studies, brain studies on guys, so they can kind of tell where they're at, so they can see what kind of impact they've had over over time. So I think it's like a combination, you know, you got like I said, Junior say, I'll what better life could that guy have set up for himself? So there's also that that thing where, you know, you don't notice that someone, you know, like, you don't notice that my hair's going right, right? it's changing lives helping people and bringing them together and raising awareness for something that is is really important to me because I know I know you've lost people in your circle I'm sure people in my circle there's you know you have to Sarah sit right there so um this this came about through a partnership that go rock at had with the Navy seal foundation also you know one of your brothers Chris Irwin who was Sarah was his level one cross fit instructor in Virginia Beach way back when I mean you know everyone is so close to to everyone and he had he had called me and said hey you know because did you look teach you any of these ones out here on the west coast I taught some in Delmar Our guys are getting interface, astral glial scarring, and that's almost like think of like a ricochet, almost bullets through the brain, and that's what comes from the blast injury, and that's able to penetrate that deep monkey brain of like, is this safe for me? So, you know, this, it's interesting when people are like upset because they didn't get to like face time what there has been on deployment in today's world, right? and you rate you RSO all the fun that's whatever you know 80 freaking blast next to your head that you sat through and there's some things that are going on inside your brain here's what's going on here's what you need to watch out for here's how you can get ahead of it that kind of conversation about this stuff is the same thing that it impacts that young new guy that goes okay got it now I can grab it now I can get a hold of it and I can move forward it's awesome Chad 1000x dot com that's where we can go to find out about this stuff go rock your at go rock cross the board cross the board Jason if you want to talk to Jason at go rock and just go rock if I live in Idaho can I do go go rock that's uh when you know what's happening it makes me so much easier and I talk about this like you get a new guy like Jason you get a new guy that looks really nervous before their first operation and if you go hey bro here's what's going on your nervous and so there's a lot of there's a lot of challenges that we will we will face what what we do know is that mass veteran suicide is not a thing guys don't all get together and kill themselves at the same time what we need we need to create communities with with bonds of people that were able to take some of the lessons that that Sarah's bravely sharing with us and and so many behind or behind and around her are sharing about their journey what they've seen we need to strengthen the community so that we're able to kind of watch after each other because the military has a stronger social fabric than pretty much anywhere and in sort of normal you know middle America or anywhere America And I say this from a two-way street, you know, it's one thing is here and say, oh, you know, we got to know that if we're not sleeping well that there's something wrong and that's going to be a problem. you know I can see why someone might think that off like for at first but the fact is you have a lot of skills because one of the main skills is straight up capability in all these different ways where you know you can learn this specific thing or learn that specific trade and all this other stuff Oh yeah, like the most beloved, probably San Diego charger, maybe even the most beloved San Diego athlete, total stud, you know, a beast of a human, like a super nice guy. When he, like, okay, so he comes home from the cupcake incident, or you just like, you can see the misery in his face and you're like, all right, I'm good. and he had this picture on the wall and it was like a shop from behind like a picture of of a guy's back and the guy's the guy whose back you see is clearly a Vietnam seal with a floppy hat and a stoner and his web gear on and his jungle cammy top and his blue jeans and he standing in front of like a corporate desk and the corporate desk there's the boss guys looking at him in the caption underneath this I'm sorry sir His face got puffy almost like the sounds terrible like, have you ever seen a fish in water instead and it's kind of like bloated? you're a lot of my what I pair with a big salad it's called the big salad chicken very robust salad um mok shake but just a plain one though plain like not usually I had a banana or frozen banana there or whatever not I don't know whatever so I'll go the peanut butter peanut butter chocolate and then milk or the almond milk or whatever just you know you don't add the oatmeal or bananas or whatever if you want to make it all luxury or whatever you can see And he drove a U-hall across country, chowing down on some flower seeds and just going like 90 and like, you know, jacked up on caffeine and got there. So, it might be a predictor of, you know, TBI and those kinds of things because, you know, if all you do is explosive breach charges next to doors all day long, I mean, you know, commanders have to figure out a way to limit that stuff. I mean don't underestimate it under any circumstances it can happen to you it will happen to you it will be terrible and and just now that you know it's common brace for it a little bit take it easy on yourself build out some support structures around you you know stuff like that but it like pairs nicely right off all right well either way these things again jockelfuel dot com subscribe if you want to influx you know where you don't got to remember to reorder or run out and all that stuff you don't have to remember you don't have to pay shipping you know I had a question mark in my head like should I even say that because it's gonna trigger you to start you know talking to me about this kind of stuff but if I'm gonna roll I'm gonna put on a different pair of shorts that we need to make jocco store dot com let's see where you get all let's say if you like something get something how about that including but not limited to the shorts right on um subscribe to this podcast and if you want to also have some other podcast jocco and ravling me and Darrell Cooper the grounded podcast or your kid podcast we also have that underground look we don't know what's gonna happen with these platforms I'm not kidding you they said the good market price $450 for a pair of jeans this was like a New York city with fashion paper and I like kicked Pete under the table like So, you know, I mean, his body, and I say this because I know so many of the guys are like really broken and he's probably the least of it in terms of broken bones and this and that, but his body is beat up as most of them are. and I was restocking years whatever after replace a sour apple sniper you would never have to know here's a thing I could do one year but in the spirit of you know nature and all that stuff like if you're eating steak every single night and someone offered you to throw off the path of the of the mango man in the spirit of variety and you know she had to think about it you know said no and then thought about it we ended up chatting with me and Emily and and Chris and Sarah and a call amount you know it's Florida Like, it was like, oh, well, you did it, you know, a good job, and he said, didn't always next. so like yeah you go in you know you're in a combat scenario you get shot in the abdomen then it's like and so you know because they're the closest to the the best way to study the brain is while it's working you know you can't make sense right and so you know we have issues doing that here with chimpanzees And you go and out with the boys, like when my wife came over and we weren't married yet, but when she, when we started, which started living with me, she would like come out with us, you know, and hang. And you know, I think that all these things come into play and that's what makes this so difficult is everyone's just got a different size cup and everyone's got a different time that they're check engine light comes on and how much it's going to take to get that thing cooled back down and it makes it, it makes it so challenging to universally say, okay, well here's the limitation that people have. Is that what it's called like this kind of like a like really soft push back and forth. and she was literally raising your hands like I look at her like raising her and like they're gonna go so I want to wrap though people coming up you're worried about people coming at you after for for a wrappedo now come on I've imposed a wrappedo on a few people and it it doesn't feel good I feel comfortable you know I always feel like I don't do it anymore I mean, sometimes, you know, at some points, they were given away like the sleep potions like it was nothing. but what the skills these guys do have I mean most of them are are very intelligent critical thinkers analytical problem solvers think outside of the box can make decisions quickly that is a lot of really great attributes that many organizations and civilian world would want and so again just to speak to I you know it's that loss of identity and it's like I've been shooting guns and busting down doors what what else do I do? And the guys that have spent time and I'm going to talk teams because that's what I know, but time and the teams, the last 10 to 20 years, they 100% in my opinion are affected by blast injury because it comes from them breaching doors, which they do not just overseas, but in training, you know, he lows RPGs all that and that constant impact to the brain is terrible. Like, okay, I'm like, I'm like, I'm on a team on my get. that's crazy it's like like she was like your little audience she had an audience of one yeah would you be stoked if your doctors doing a surgery on you like high five and then laughing like not right right you're gonna be stoked on that
