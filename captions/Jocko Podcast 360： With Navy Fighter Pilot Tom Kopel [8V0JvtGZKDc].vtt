00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.46
This is Jocko podcast number 360 with Dave Burke and me,

2
00:00:04.46 --> 00:00:05.30
Jocko Willink.

3
00:00:05.30 --> 00:00:06.22
Good evening, Dave.

4
00:00:06.22 --> 00:00:07.06
Good evening.

5
00:00:08.58 --> 00:00:11.34
The secretary of the Navy takes pleasure

6
00:00:11.34 --> 00:00:13.98
in presenting the Navy Commandation Medal

7
00:00:13.98 --> 00:00:17.10
to Lieutenant Thomas Coppell for services set forth

8
00:00:17.10 --> 00:00:19.18
in the following citation.

9
00:00:19.18 --> 00:00:23.38
For heroic achievement as a pilot of jet aircraft

10
00:00:23.38 --> 00:00:27.94
while attached to fighter squadron 142,

11
00:00:27.94 --> 00:00:30.90
embarked in USS Constellation.

12
00:00:30.90 --> 00:00:33.50
On 14 January, 1970,

13
00:00:33.50 --> 00:00:35.70
Lieutenant Coppell flew the wing aircraft

14
00:00:35.70 --> 00:00:38.62
of a two-plane attack mission in Southeast Asia.

15
00:00:38.62 --> 00:00:41.86
Despite heavy anti-aircraft fire in the area,

16
00:00:41.86 --> 00:00:44.18
he placed all of his bombs on target,

17
00:00:44.18 --> 00:00:46.82
resulting in five enemy trucks destroyed

18
00:00:46.82 --> 00:00:51.56
and many secondary explosions and many enemy casualties.

19
00:00:52.46 --> 00:00:54.38
His professional determination in spite of

20
00:00:54.38 --> 00:00:57.92
heavy anti-aircraft fire and adverse weather conditions

21
00:00:57.92 --> 00:01:00.42
resulted in a substantial damage

22
00:01:00.42 --> 00:01:03.42
to the enemy's logistics efforts.

23
00:01:03.42 --> 00:01:06.70
Lieutenant Coppell's superb airmanship, courage,

24
00:01:06.70 --> 00:01:10.26
and devotion to duty reflected great credit upon himself

25
00:01:10.26 --> 00:01:13.18
and weren't keeping with the highest traditions

26
00:01:13.18 --> 00:01:16.34
of the United States Naval Service.

27
00:01:16.34 --> 00:01:20.46
The combat distinguishing device is authorized

28
00:01:20.46 --> 00:01:24.18
for the secretary M.F. Weisner,

29
00:01:24.18 --> 00:01:29.16
Vice Admiral, United States Navy.

30
00:01:29.16 --> 00:01:33.26
And that is a citation that represents

31
00:01:33.26 --> 00:01:35.18
the types of missions that were flown

32
00:01:35.18 --> 00:01:38.22
by Navy fighters day after day,

33
00:01:38.22 --> 00:01:42.54
night after night, week after week, month after month,

34
00:01:42.54 --> 00:01:44.30
year after year.

35
00:01:44.30 --> 00:01:45.90
Those were the type of missions

36
00:01:45.90 --> 00:01:53.40
that resulted in solid battle damage to the enemy,

37
00:01:54.70 --> 00:01:59.70
but also resulted in 532 aircraft lost in combat.

38
00:02:00.70 --> 00:02:05.70
401 aviators killed, 64 missing, 179 captured,

39
00:02:08.10 --> 00:02:09.54
who became prisoners of war.

40
00:02:11.26 --> 00:02:14.26
75 of those aircraft that were shot down

41
00:02:14.26 --> 00:02:16.38
were F-4 Phanoms.

42
00:02:19.62 --> 00:02:21.98
These missions were flown by pilots

43
00:02:21.98 --> 00:02:24.42
who took incredible risks to get the job done

44
00:02:24.42 --> 00:02:27.90
and eventually pilots that rewrote the book

45
00:02:27.90 --> 00:02:30.74
on air to air combat and laid the foundation

46
00:02:30.74 --> 00:02:34.38
for how fighter pilots are trained to this very day.

47
00:02:34.38 --> 00:02:36.90
And it's an honor to have one of these pilots

48
00:02:36.90 --> 00:02:40.78
here with us tonight, that pilot in fact,

49
00:02:40.78 --> 00:02:45.38
is from the opening award citation, Tom Copel.

50
00:02:45.38 --> 00:02:47.70
Tom, thanks for coming down.

51
00:02:47.70 --> 00:02:48.86
Appreciate you coming out here.

52
00:02:48.86 --> 00:02:50.54
Anyone know we got Dave?

53
00:02:51.94 --> 00:02:53.34
He used to keep me honest.

54
00:02:54.50 --> 00:02:57.50
Well, he's always excited.

55
00:02:57.50 --> 00:02:59.30
The few times I've had some pilots on

56
00:02:59.30 --> 00:03:02.54
without having Dave on, he's not happy about it.

57
00:03:03.42 --> 00:03:08.42
So we got him here and I guess let's just kind of

58
00:03:08.62 --> 00:03:10.66
start from the beginning and how you grew up

59
00:03:10.66 --> 00:03:11.58
and where you came from.

60
00:03:11.58 --> 00:03:15.70
So you were born in Queens, is that right?

61
00:03:15.70 --> 00:03:19.10
Yeah, Jamaica Hospital, huge hospital in Queens,

62
00:03:19.10 --> 00:03:23.46
but we lived just over the city line in a new development

63
00:03:23.46 --> 00:03:27.30
that the house was built and my parents moved in

64
00:03:27.30 --> 00:03:29.26
with a brand new baby.

65
00:03:29.26 --> 00:03:31.18
And this was 19 what?

66
00:03:31.18 --> 00:03:32.38
41.

67
00:03:32.38 --> 00:03:33.98
So you're pre-war.

68
00:03:33.98 --> 00:03:37.46
Yeah, and my dad was not drafted because of me.

69
00:03:37.46 --> 00:03:42.46
He was an insurance underwriter in the financial district

70
00:03:42.86 --> 00:03:47.86
of insurance district of downtown, downtown Manhattan,

71
00:03:48.34 --> 00:03:51.18
Nassau Street and those places down there.

72
00:03:51.18 --> 00:03:52.02
How much?

73
00:03:52.02 --> 00:03:54.02
And a nice guy, I have to say.

74
00:03:54.02 --> 00:03:54.86
Well, that's good.

75
00:03:54.86 --> 00:03:59.86
How much, so you're born in 1941,

76
00:04:00.18 --> 00:04:04.14
I'm assuming before the war started, before Pearl Harbor?

77
00:04:04.14 --> 00:04:07.54
I was, yeah, August and Pearl Harbor was in December.

78
00:04:07.54 --> 00:04:08.38
Okay.

79
00:04:08.38 --> 00:04:09.22
Yeah.

80
00:04:09.22 --> 00:04:12.74
So as you're growing up, is there any part of World War II

81
00:04:12.74 --> 00:04:14.34
that you remember?

82
00:04:14.34 --> 00:04:16.90
I remember my mother telling me that the war in Japan

83
00:04:16.90 --> 00:04:18.86
was over, I don't remember her telling me

84
00:04:18.86 --> 00:04:20.66
that the war in Europe was over.

85
00:04:23.42 --> 00:04:26.90
On the other hand, since I was four years old

86
00:04:26.90 --> 00:04:30.14
and I had a brand new sister, they sort of left me alone

87
00:04:30.14 --> 00:04:33.10
and I would go down to the corner, believe it or not.

88
00:04:33.10 --> 00:04:35.30
What was then, I guess it probably still is

89
00:04:35.30 --> 00:04:38.86
Hillside Avenue and I used to see low-boy trucks

90
00:04:38.86 --> 00:04:43.86
with grown, I assume they were F-6 fighters

91
00:04:46.54 --> 00:04:47.74
with the wings removed.

92
00:04:47.74 --> 00:04:51.54
They put the fuselage and the wings on the side.

93
00:04:51.54 --> 00:04:54.58
I think the engines and propellers were on them

94
00:04:54.58 --> 00:04:57.38
but obviously they were on their way to South Pacific.

95
00:04:57.38 --> 00:04:59.14
And ask your mother, what the heck is that?

96
00:04:59.14 --> 00:05:02.46
And she would say, oh, they're going to war

97
00:05:02.46 --> 00:05:03.90
and stuff like that.

98
00:05:03.90 --> 00:05:07.90
So I assume that was 1944.

99
00:05:08.78 --> 00:05:10.62
I was three years old, sitting on a curb

100
00:05:10.62 --> 00:05:13.10
and that's the first I remember of any of that

101
00:05:13.10 --> 00:05:15.74
but they told me that both Grumman and Republic

102
00:05:15.74 --> 00:05:18.90
were out in the island at that time,

103
00:05:18.90 --> 00:05:21.54
I guess it was farms.

104
00:05:21.54 --> 00:05:24.46
Did that leave an impression on you seeing the fighters?

105
00:05:24.46 --> 00:05:26.22
I mean, first of all, I don't remember anything

106
00:05:26.22 --> 00:05:27.94
until I was about 17, I think.

107
00:05:27.94 --> 00:05:30.78
So you remember in 7.3 is pretty impressive.

108
00:05:30.78 --> 00:05:35.34
But did you think, oh, these are war planes going to war?

109
00:05:35.34 --> 00:05:36.58
Did that make any sense to you?

110
00:05:36.58 --> 00:05:38.82
Oh yes, oh yes.

111
00:05:38.82 --> 00:05:40.98
But I never expected that I would be a guy

112
00:05:40.98 --> 00:05:44.10
that would fly them or anything like that.

113
00:05:44.10 --> 00:05:47.38
And the other thing I remember about flying machines

114
00:05:47.38 --> 00:05:51.38
was not combat or war or anything like that.

115
00:05:51.38 --> 00:05:55.70
It was the fact that Idlewild that became JFK

116
00:05:55.70 --> 00:05:58.14
when they expanded it and the airport

117
00:05:58.14 --> 00:06:03.14
was seeing the DC7Bs coming in from Europe.

118
00:06:05.10 --> 00:06:08.58
In bad weather, they used the east-west runway

119
00:06:08.58 --> 00:06:12.54
and streaming fire out of the back of the,

120
00:06:12.54 --> 00:06:15.42
off the top of the wings and how the heck is that?

121
00:06:15.42 --> 00:06:18.78
So I finally, in my grown-up days,

122
00:06:18.78 --> 00:06:21.50
talked to a guy who was a retired naval aviator,

123
00:06:21.50 --> 00:06:24.38
P3's, so he sent me.

124
00:06:24.38 --> 00:06:29.30
I said, Dennis, why didn't you want to be a carrier guy?

125
00:06:29.30 --> 00:06:30.74
Many engines, Tom.

126
00:06:30.74 --> 00:06:32.30
Oh, sorry about that.

127
00:06:32.30 --> 00:06:37.30
But at any rate, he was a flight engineer on DC7Bs

128
00:06:37.30 --> 00:06:39.10
and he said that's because a flight engineer

129
00:06:39.10 --> 00:06:44.10
goes full rich and flames roaring out the back

130
00:06:44.46 --> 00:06:48.18
and especially in foggy weather when they were, you know.

131
00:06:48.18 --> 00:06:49.50
Oh, so that's what you'd be saying.

132
00:06:49.50 --> 00:06:51.62
Yeah, I wanted to do that.

133
00:06:51.62 --> 00:06:53.82
That's really hot stuff, you know.

134
00:06:53.82 --> 00:06:58.66
But, and well, and jumping ahead, I guess,

135
00:06:58.66 --> 00:07:01.34
but why do I want to go with,

136
00:07:01.34 --> 00:07:04.22
I wanted, my father said, I graduated from college.

137
00:07:04.22 --> 00:07:05.82
My dad said, what are you gonna do?

138
00:07:05.82 --> 00:07:07.06
And I said, I don't know.

139
00:07:07.06 --> 00:07:09.50
He said, why don't you see one of the services

140
00:07:09.50 --> 00:07:10.90
will teach you how to fly?

141
00:07:10.90 --> 00:07:12.34
I said, don't take guys like me.

142
00:07:12.34 --> 00:07:13.42
He said, they sure do.

143
00:07:13.42 --> 00:07:17.70
Well, before you get to college, what was growing up like?

144
00:07:17.70 --> 00:07:19.86
So did you grow up there just outside the city?

145
00:07:19.86 --> 00:07:23.94
Yeah, and I was just a kid.

146
00:07:23.94 --> 00:07:27.78
A four-year-old kid down on the corner

147
00:07:27.78 --> 00:07:30.70
at Hillside Avenue by yourself, which is cool.

148
00:07:30.70 --> 00:07:33.10
Yeah, but that was a different time, I think,

149
00:07:33.10 --> 00:07:35.46
or something like, maybe there were as many monsters

150
00:07:35.46 --> 00:07:37.34
around then as there are now,

151
00:07:37.34 --> 00:07:40.34
but nobody talked about or acted that way.

152
00:07:40.34 --> 00:07:43.22
And as soon as I got a bike, you know, it was.

153
00:07:43.22 --> 00:07:44.06
Then it was really on.

154
00:07:44.06 --> 00:07:45.30
Yeah.

155
00:07:45.30 --> 00:07:47.34
I was never there.

156
00:07:47.34 --> 00:07:49.10
Were you, how'd you do in school?

157
00:07:49.10 --> 00:07:49.94
Did you like school?

158
00:07:49.94 --> 00:07:50.78
Terrible.

159
00:07:50.78 --> 00:07:51.62
I hated school.

160
00:07:51.62 --> 00:07:53.58
I hated school.

161
00:07:53.58 --> 00:07:56.38
I was a, my wife loves to tease me

162
00:07:56.38 --> 00:07:58.86
that I was such a terrible little monster

163
00:07:58.86 --> 00:08:03.66
that one of the classrooms that I was in in grade school

164
00:08:03.66 --> 00:08:06.06
had a, it was at the two classrooms

165
00:08:06.06 --> 00:08:07.26
at the end of the hallway.

166
00:08:07.26 --> 00:08:09.86
And then a connecting room between the two.

167
00:08:09.86 --> 00:08:12.54
She put me in the connecting room with a door that opened

168
00:08:12.54 --> 00:08:14.02
so I could see the blackboard.

169
00:08:14.02 --> 00:08:16.50
But I was in the room with the door open

170
00:08:16.50 --> 00:08:18.86
about 10 inches wide.

171
00:08:18.86 --> 00:08:21.10
And you were just a hyperactive kid?

172
00:08:21.10 --> 00:08:22.10
I think so.

173
00:08:22.10 --> 00:08:25.66
And the board with all of that, I could read before.

174
00:08:25.66 --> 00:08:28.22
I was, I could read when I was four.

175
00:08:28.22 --> 00:08:31.58
So my, we're always buying me books.

176
00:08:31.58 --> 00:08:34.50
So stuff like that.

177
00:08:34.50 --> 00:08:36.46
So you were a smart little board.

178
00:08:36.46 --> 00:08:37.30
I guess.

179
00:08:37.30 --> 00:08:38.14
I don't know.

180
00:08:38.14 --> 00:08:38.98
What about sports?

181
00:08:38.98 --> 00:08:40.26
Were you into sports at all?

182
00:08:40.26 --> 00:08:41.10
Yeah.

183
00:08:41.10 --> 00:08:45.58
Cause I was the biggest kid and played,

184
00:08:46.70 --> 00:08:48.50
touched football in high school, which got,

185
00:08:48.50 --> 00:08:51.26
I'm sorry, in grade school, seventh and eighth grade,

186
00:08:51.26 --> 00:08:52.70
and it gets a little rough.

187
00:08:52.70 --> 00:08:54.62
At least it did then.

188
00:08:54.62 --> 00:08:57.10
So, but I never got hurt or anything like that.

189
00:08:57.10 --> 00:08:58.62
And then when I got to high school,

190
00:08:58.62 --> 00:09:03.62
I played, played football and played first team.

191
00:09:03.62 --> 00:09:05.78
What year did you graduate high school?

192
00:09:05.78 --> 00:09:06.62
59.

193
00:09:07.58 --> 00:09:09.86
So you grew up in like the iconic fifties.

194
00:09:09.86 --> 00:09:10.70
That's right.

195
00:09:10.70 --> 00:09:11.54
That's right.

196
00:09:11.54 --> 00:09:13.14
When you see those movies, are you just?

197
00:09:13.14 --> 00:09:14.26
I think it's awful.

198
00:09:14.26 --> 00:09:15.66
Why is it awful?

199
00:09:15.66 --> 00:09:19.98
The clothes that they wear and the nostalgia, the cars,

200
00:09:19.98 --> 00:09:24.14
we realize I do today are death traps.

201
00:09:24.14 --> 00:09:27.46
But they bring huge money, these cars and the fifties.

202
00:09:27.46 --> 00:09:28.30
Which one did you have?

203
00:09:28.30 --> 00:09:29.14
You must have had one.

204
00:09:29.14 --> 00:09:29.98
Did you have one?

205
00:09:29.98 --> 00:09:31.78
I guess maybe not in the city.

206
00:09:31.78 --> 00:09:33.10
No, it's not the city.

207
00:09:33.10 --> 00:09:34.78
It was real suburbs.

208
00:09:34.78 --> 00:09:39.10
Wooden houses on little bitty, little bitty lots.

209
00:09:39.10 --> 00:09:40.26
So did you have a car?

210
00:09:41.70 --> 00:09:42.70
No.

211
00:09:42.70 --> 00:09:43.54
You know what?

212
00:09:43.54 --> 00:09:47.50
I never owned a car until I was in flying school

213
00:09:47.50 --> 00:09:50.38
in Big Spring, Texas.

214
00:09:51.42 --> 00:09:53.18
Never had a need of one.

215
00:09:53.18 --> 00:09:54.02
Got around.

216
00:09:54.02 --> 00:09:58.14
Back in the fifties, early sixties,

217
00:09:58.14 --> 00:10:00.22
you stick out your thumb, you got a ride.

218
00:10:01.34 --> 00:10:04.22
People were different then, somehow or other.

219
00:10:04.22 --> 00:10:07.02
I don't really understand how that is.

220
00:10:07.02 --> 00:10:10.18
But I went all of the eastern half of the United States

221
00:10:10.18 --> 00:10:11.54
with my thumb.

222
00:10:11.54 --> 00:10:13.34
I went everywhere.

223
00:10:13.34 --> 00:10:17.06
And never worried about getting back or anything like that.

224
00:10:17.06 --> 00:10:20.42
But on one time, the worst time I ever had doing that

225
00:10:20.42 --> 00:10:23.58
was on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Western Pennsylvania.

226
00:10:23.58 --> 00:10:25.54
I was there for 12 hours.

227
00:10:27.38 --> 00:10:28.38
What?

228
00:10:28.38 --> 00:10:29.46
No one would pick me up.

229
00:10:29.46 --> 00:10:30.58
I have no idea why.

230
00:10:30.58 --> 00:10:33.42
And maybe I'd look scowly or something.

231
00:10:33.42 --> 00:10:35.26
I don't know.

232
00:10:35.26 --> 00:10:37.06
I don't think I would have been a great hitchhiker

233
00:10:37.06 --> 00:10:39.54
if it comes down to looking scowly.

234
00:10:39.54 --> 00:10:41.34
How we definitely have some issues.

235
00:10:41.34 --> 00:10:43.50
So you're growing up in the iconic fifties.

236
00:10:43.50 --> 00:10:47.22
How do those movies miss the mark, hit the mark?

237
00:10:47.22 --> 00:10:48.98
I mean, how are they?

238
00:10:48.98 --> 00:10:50.42
The fifties movies.

239
00:10:50.42 --> 00:10:51.26
Yeah.

240
00:10:51.26 --> 00:10:52.42
I don't know.

241
00:10:52.42 --> 00:10:53.94
Frankly, I don't remember.

242
00:10:55.82 --> 00:10:58.58
I don't remember what movies you might be talking about.

243
00:10:58.58 --> 00:11:00.22
What about Elvis?

244
00:11:00.22 --> 00:11:01.06
You remember?

245
00:11:01.06 --> 00:11:02.62
I thought it was awful.

246
00:11:02.62 --> 00:11:03.70
You thought Elvis was awful.

247
00:11:03.70 --> 00:11:04.70
I personally did.

248
00:11:04.70 --> 00:11:06.86
I guess my sisters thought otherwise.

249
00:11:06.86 --> 00:11:08.34
Three younger sisters.

250
00:11:08.34 --> 00:11:12.06
But I thought that was the dumbest thing I ever heard of.

251
00:11:12.06 --> 00:11:13.66
So that's what I thought.

252
00:11:13.66 --> 00:11:15.26
So what were you listening to?

253
00:11:16.66 --> 00:11:18.70
I have to admit, classical music.

254
00:11:18.70 --> 00:11:23.26
My minor story.

255
00:11:23.26 --> 00:11:27.22
My wife, when, before we were married,

256
00:11:28.62 --> 00:11:31.18
somehow or other I introduced her to the fact

257
00:11:31.18 --> 00:11:34.74
that I listened mostly to classical music.

258
00:11:34.74 --> 00:11:35.82
And she went home.

259
00:11:35.82 --> 00:11:37.06
She tells me now.

260
00:11:37.06 --> 00:11:40.38
Actually, after we were married,

261
00:11:40.38 --> 00:11:42.70
said this guy is a little bit weird.

262
00:11:42.70 --> 00:11:43.54
Suspect for sure.

263
00:11:43.54 --> 00:11:45.34
This is the classical music.

264
00:11:45.34 --> 00:11:48.78
I don't know.

265
00:11:48.78 --> 00:11:53.06
Rimsky-Korsakov-Sherzad that everybody knows.

266
00:11:53.06 --> 00:11:55.06
I was really intrigued by that.

267
00:11:56.38 --> 00:11:59.34
So I listened to classical music and still do it today.

268
00:11:59.34 --> 00:12:00.22
Whatever.

269
00:12:00.22 --> 00:12:02.38
So the rock and roll thing was not your scene?

270
00:12:02.38 --> 00:12:06.06
Not until the California, the British invasion

271
00:12:06.06 --> 00:12:07.58
and California.

272
00:12:07.58 --> 00:12:09.06
And that was all together different.

273
00:12:09.06 --> 00:12:10.74
Okay, we'll get there.

274
00:12:10.74 --> 00:12:14.82
So you graduate from high school, 1959.

275
00:12:14.82 --> 00:12:16.86
So you lived through the Korean War as well?

276
00:12:16.86 --> 00:12:18.34
I remember it well.

277
00:12:18.34 --> 00:12:20.50
I remember being in Boy Scout camp

278
00:12:20.50 --> 00:12:23.34
when they announced the armistice

279
00:12:24.34 --> 00:12:29.34
had just been signed that morning or whenever it was.

280
00:12:30.38 --> 00:12:31.22
That was a big deal.

281
00:12:31.22 --> 00:12:32.50
Everybody sheared.

282
00:12:32.50 --> 00:12:35.02
But you still didn't get the impression

283
00:12:35.02 --> 00:12:36.82
that that was something that you might do one day?

284
00:12:36.82 --> 00:12:37.74
No, no.

285
00:12:37.74 --> 00:12:41.54
There was no military tradition in the family at all,

286
00:12:41.54 --> 00:12:46.54
except for a grand uncle, Maximum Nice Guy,

287
00:12:47.06 --> 00:12:52.06
who was a graduate of the same college

288
00:12:52.30 --> 00:12:55.98
as Donald Trump graduated, still exists

289
00:12:55.98 --> 00:13:00.38
at New York State Military Academy, I think it's called.

290
00:13:00.38 --> 00:13:04.98
But he graduated in 1936 or something like that.

291
00:13:04.98 --> 00:13:09.98
And he was part of the last combat cavalry regiment

292
00:13:10.90 --> 00:13:13.54
in the United States Army.

293
00:13:13.54 --> 00:13:17.26
And I was disbanded, I think in 1939,

294
00:13:17.26 --> 00:13:19.50
as the storm clouds were gathering

295
00:13:19.50 --> 00:13:21.42
and they disbanded that unit.

296
00:13:21.42 --> 00:13:25.34
But that was officers with real swords

297
00:13:25.34 --> 00:13:28.18
and two horses each and all the rest

298
00:13:28.18 --> 00:13:30.66
of everything else about that.

299
00:13:30.66 --> 00:13:34.54
But that was a combat unit, not a display unit.

300
00:13:34.54 --> 00:13:36.02
And it was the last one.

301
00:13:36.02 --> 00:13:39.62
He wound up in Iceland for the duration of the war,

302
00:13:39.62 --> 00:13:42.46
deriding the whole experience.

303
00:13:42.46 --> 00:13:45.62
But I only realized in my grown-up days

304
00:13:45.62 --> 00:13:49.74
that if Hitler had won the Battle of Britain,

305
00:13:49.74 --> 00:13:51.54
Iceland was next.

306
00:13:51.54 --> 00:13:54.62
And they probably, no doubt knew that,

307
00:13:54.62 --> 00:13:59.02
but they all, I went to a reunion with him at one point

308
00:13:59.02 --> 00:14:02.78
and they all derided their experience there and so forth.

309
00:14:02.78 --> 00:14:04.82
But they would have been the first to be killed

310
00:14:04.82 --> 00:14:09.82
and the first super German raid on Iceland

311
00:14:10.54 --> 00:14:11.82
to flatten the place.

312
00:14:11.82 --> 00:14:14.18
Yeah, we used to get a similar thing in the SEAL teams

313
00:14:14.18 --> 00:14:16.82
where you'd get some platoons would be going over

314
00:14:16.82 --> 00:14:19.06
to Iraq or Afghanistan.

315
00:14:19.06 --> 00:14:23.18
And some other platoons would be going to like Guam

316
00:14:23.18 --> 00:14:25.30
or somewhere where there's no war going on.

317
00:14:25.30 --> 00:14:27.70
And of course, all the guys that are,

318
00:14:27.70 --> 00:14:30.06
get sent to Guam are just angry

319
00:14:30.06 --> 00:14:32.06
that they can't be in Iraq or Afghanistan.

320
00:14:32.06 --> 00:14:34.22
And meanwhile, the guys in Iraq or Afghanistan

321
00:14:34.22 --> 00:14:37.22
are freezing or sweating to death

322
00:14:37.22 --> 00:14:38.46
or to get shot at or whatever.

323
00:14:38.46 --> 00:14:41.74
Yeah, they use real bullets here and stuff like that.

324
00:14:41.74 --> 00:14:42.58
But that's what, you know,

325
00:14:42.58 --> 00:14:44.62
that's what people join the SEAL teams for.

326
00:14:44.62 --> 00:14:45.46
Yeah.

327
00:14:45.46 --> 00:14:48.14
And apparently the horse cavalry as well.

328
00:14:48.14 --> 00:14:50.54
Yeah, it was for real.

329
00:14:50.54 --> 00:14:53.98
Swords and the whole deal with those guys.

330
00:14:53.98 --> 00:14:56.82
And he was a wonderful man, wonderful man.

331
00:14:57.74 --> 00:15:01.82
When sisters were born, I got farmed out with him twice

332
00:15:01.82 --> 00:15:02.94
in the summertime.

333
00:15:02.94 --> 00:15:07.94
And he worked in Lower New York State Binghamton

334
00:15:09.10 --> 00:15:11.42
and Elmira, those places around there.

335
00:15:11.42 --> 00:15:16.42
And he had grand aunts who had a truncated farm there.

336
00:15:16.58 --> 00:15:20.02
And he farmed me out with them.

337
00:15:20.02 --> 00:15:21.10
You're just slave labor.

338
00:15:21.10 --> 00:15:22.50
And I had fun.

339
00:15:22.50 --> 00:15:27.50
I had kid fun being a kid with cornfields and ponds

340
00:15:27.50 --> 00:15:31.66
and stuff like that all over the place there.

341
00:15:31.66 --> 00:15:32.90
And then where'd you end up?

342
00:15:32.90 --> 00:15:34.78
So where'd you end up going to college?

343
00:15:34.78 --> 00:15:37.34
I went to Albright College in Reading, PA.

344
00:15:39.42 --> 00:15:41.18
Commuter for me.

345
00:15:41.18 --> 00:15:43.34
Very small college at that time,

346
00:15:43.34 --> 00:15:45.58
850 students at that time.

347
00:15:45.58 --> 00:15:48.94
And now it's about 12 or 1300,

348
00:15:48.94 --> 00:15:51.26
maybe a little bit more than that.

349
00:15:51.26 --> 00:15:54.02
But wonderful teachers there.

350
00:15:54.02 --> 00:15:55.26
Absolutely wonderful.

351
00:15:55.26 --> 00:15:58.58
Especially the man, but one notable woman

352
00:15:58.58 --> 00:16:01.98
who was a pacifist of all things.

353
00:16:01.98 --> 00:16:04.26
But she was absolutely a wonderful woman.

354
00:16:04.26 --> 00:16:05.10
And...

355
00:16:05.10 --> 00:16:08.18
How come she left such a big impression on you?

356
00:16:08.18 --> 00:16:10.38
Because she was so straight.

357
00:16:10.38 --> 00:16:12.50
I'd never met a woman quite like that.

358
00:16:12.50 --> 00:16:17.50
She was straightforward and thoughtful and aggressive.

359
00:16:18.98 --> 00:16:21.14
I like a woman who is my wife.

360
00:16:21.14 --> 00:16:26.14
She tells you what's on her mind immediately.

361
00:16:27.22 --> 00:16:29.10
And she was that way, I guess.

362
00:16:29.10 --> 00:16:30.38
And she was a professor there?

363
00:16:30.38 --> 00:16:31.22
Yeah, she was.

364
00:16:31.22 --> 00:16:32.06
What was she teaching?

365
00:16:32.06 --> 00:16:34.74
English, English and speech.

366
00:16:34.74 --> 00:16:39.74
And she changed with her professional abilities and so forth.

367
00:16:43.18 --> 00:16:48.06
And I remember sitting there arguing with her silently.

368
00:16:48.06 --> 00:16:53.06
No, a ten minute lecture about using the atomic bomb

369
00:16:54.14 --> 00:16:56.82
in Japan, she was opposed to that.

370
00:16:56.82 --> 00:17:01.82
And I don't think she had read notably or widely enough

371
00:17:03.14 --> 00:17:05.26
about all that.

372
00:17:05.26 --> 00:17:09.74
And I had at that point, as opposed to that.

373
00:17:09.74 --> 00:17:12.58
But still, I thought she was really great.

374
00:17:14.02 --> 00:17:16.70
Point of view sort of thing.

375
00:17:16.70 --> 00:17:18.58
What were you studying?

376
00:17:18.58 --> 00:17:23.58
I was an econ major, not business, economics

377
00:17:24.62 --> 00:17:26.06
and minor in history.

378
00:17:27.42 --> 00:17:31.62
And had some fabulous teachers there.

379
00:17:32.98 --> 00:17:37.98
A guy named Wilbur Gingrich who was a genuinely world famous

380
00:17:39.74 --> 00:17:43.30
Greek scholar and biblical scholar.

381
00:17:43.30 --> 00:17:46.86
A couple of other guys that nobody ever heard of,

382
00:17:46.86 --> 00:17:48.46
but a wonderful man.

383
00:17:48.46 --> 00:17:53.46
And a crazy guy who loved to teach European

384
00:17:56.18 --> 00:17:58.02
and Russian history.

385
00:17:58.02 --> 00:17:59.70
And I took him for Russian.

386
00:17:59.70 --> 00:18:01.94
Don't take him for God's sakes.

387
00:18:01.94 --> 00:18:04.10
You've got a D out of that.

388
00:18:04.10 --> 00:18:07.86
And he'll blither you and you can't write fast enough.

389
00:18:07.86 --> 00:18:10.18
And his class, his name was,

390
00:18:10.18 --> 00:18:15.18
Gingrich was the biblical scholar, a Greek scholar.

391
00:18:18.78 --> 00:18:19.62
Can you believe it?

392
00:18:19.62 --> 00:18:20.46
His name escapes me.

393
00:18:20.46 --> 00:18:22.54
But at any rate, Kistler.

394
00:18:22.54 --> 00:18:26.82
And they said, you'll get a D out of his class

395
00:18:26.82 --> 00:18:29.50
because you can't write fast enough and stuff like that.

396
00:18:29.50 --> 00:18:33.34
But he was something, he smoked continuously.

397
00:18:35.34 --> 00:18:37.90
And always had the window open and the butts went out

398
00:18:37.90 --> 00:18:40.62
of the window and he'd torch up another one.

399
00:18:40.62 --> 00:18:43.02
But he was really something.

400
00:18:43.02 --> 00:18:44.94
What'd you get in the class?

401
00:18:44.94 --> 00:18:47.86
B, all of six in the class.

402
00:18:47.86 --> 00:18:52.62
So at some point you got more into school than you were

403
00:18:52.62 --> 00:18:54.14
when you were in grammar school or whatever.

404
00:18:54.14 --> 00:18:56.86
Yeah, no, because I had smart people

405
00:18:56.86 --> 00:18:58.70
who were just smarter than I was.

406
00:18:58.70 --> 00:19:02.10
And how'd you put it?

407
00:19:02.10 --> 00:19:04.46
My parents weren't really educated, if you will.

408
00:19:04.46 --> 00:19:07.30
My mother had a college degree from NYU,

409
00:19:07.30 --> 00:19:10.06
but I think she skated as much as she could.

410
00:19:10.06 --> 00:19:13.42
And my dad, they kicked him out of grade school,

411
00:19:13.42 --> 00:19:18.42
yeah, out of school when he was after 10th grade,

412
00:19:18.42 --> 00:19:21.26
I think, because he was done.

413
00:19:21.26 --> 00:19:24.86
They did that at that time in the 20s.

414
00:19:24.86 --> 00:19:28.50
So both of them wanted me to be educated.

415
00:19:28.50 --> 00:19:32.58
And so it was interesting to be in the company

416
00:19:32.58 --> 00:19:34.26
of genuinely educated people.

417
00:19:34.26 --> 00:19:36.42
And I didn't catch fire at first

418
00:19:36.42 --> 00:19:38.58
by the time I was a junior.

419
00:19:38.58 --> 00:19:42.58
I understood that this is really an experience.

420
00:19:42.58 --> 00:19:48.70
You can get interesting things out of these people.

421
00:19:48.70 --> 00:19:51.30
By the time I was a senior, I didn't want to leave.

422
00:19:51.30 --> 00:19:54.86
Because you get to talk as a grown-up

423
00:19:54.86 --> 00:19:56.78
with these grown-ups who listen to you

424
00:19:56.78 --> 00:20:00.38
and then tell you things you had never conceived of before

425
00:20:00.38 --> 00:20:01.98
and stuff like that.

426
00:20:01.98 --> 00:20:06.94
So I had a good time in college until they kicked me out.

427
00:20:06.94 --> 00:20:08.94
At what point did you start looking at the military

428
00:20:08.94 --> 00:20:12.22
as a legitimate option for you?

429
00:20:12.22 --> 00:20:15.62
Not until I was about to graduate.

430
00:20:15.62 --> 00:20:19.94
And back in the good old days, my dad worked.

431
00:20:19.94 --> 00:20:22.30
He was a New Yorker, New Yorker, New Yorker,

432
00:20:22.30 --> 00:20:25.74
but he got a job in Redding, Pennsylvania.

433
00:20:25.74 --> 00:20:27.18
And it was a shock to all of us.

434
00:20:27.18 --> 00:20:28.94
I didn't want to leave the school I was in.

435
00:20:28.94 --> 00:20:31.38
I was going to Progles.

436
00:20:31.38 --> 00:20:32.66
So this is back in high school?

437
00:20:32.66 --> 00:20:34.14
Yeah.

438
00:20:34.14 --> 00:20:37.70
I was two years into Chamonaut High School in Long Island,

439
00:20:37.70 --> 00:20:41.98
which is by entrance exams and tuition.

440
00:20:41.98 --> 00:20:43.34
And I liked it there.

441
00:20:43.34 --> 00:20:45.98
I was doing a little bit better, a little bit better.

442
00:20:45.98 --> 00:20:47.86
But I didn't want to leave.

443
00:20:47.86 --> 00:20:50.70
And he came home and said he'd been offered a job

444
00:20:50.70 --> 00:20:51.86
in Redding, Pennsylvania.

445
00:20:51.86 --> 00:20:54.58
Where is that?

446
00:20:54.58 --> 00:20:58.14
We were New Yorkers, New Yorkers.

447
00:20:58.14 --> 00:20:59.46
I can do the accent, too.

448
00:20:59.46 --> 00:21:01.62
And of course, when you get to Pennsylvania,

449
00:21:01.62 --> 00:21:05.54
the kids make endless fun of you because of your accent

450
00:21:05.54 --> 00:21:06.30
and stuff.

451
00:21:06.30 --> 00:21:09.46
But at any rate, where was I in this?

452
00:21:09.46 --> 00:21:12.06
We're just trying to figure out, at what point did you

453
00:21:12.06 --> 00:21:13.66
think the military might be an option?

454
00:21:13.66 --> 00:21:20.30
I could go downtown Redding and go up the fire tower staircase

455
00:21:20.30 --> 00:21:24.06
and plop in the chair in my dad's office.

456
00:21:24.06 --> 00:21:25.94
And he said, so what are you going to do?

457
00:21:25.94 --> 00:21:27.54
You're going to graduate here.

458
00:21:27.54 --> 00:21:29.70
I said, I don't know.

459
00:21:29.70 --> 00:21:34.14
He said, have you considered maybe the government would

460
00:21:34.14 --> 00:21:36.22
teach you how to fly in one of the services?

461
00:21:36.22 --> 00:21:38.42
And I, they don't take guys like me.

462
00:21:38.42 --> 00:21:40.02
He said, they surely do.

463
00:21:40.02 --> 00:21:46.02
2020s and good shape, nothing wrong with it.

464
00:21:46.02 --> 00:21:48.66
So I applied to the Navy guy.

465
00:21:48.66 --> 00:21:53.54
And he was an embarrassment.

466
00:21:53.54 --> 00:21:59.54
Overweight, feet up on the desk, didn't seem to care about

467
00:21:59.54 --> 00:21:59.98
anything.

468
00:21:59.98 --> 00:22:01.38
I filled out all his paperwork.

469
00:22:01.38 --> 00:22:03.22
And he never got back to me.

470
00:22:03.22 --> 00:22:04.46
Went to the Air Force guy.

471
00:22:04.46 --> 00:22:09.22
And he was close to his quota, probably.

472
00:22:09.22 --> 00:22:11.10
He drove me around.

473
00:22:11.10 --> 00:22:13.46
You have to go here and fill out these.

474
00:22:13.46 --> 00:22:16.54
I'll help you fill out the form.

475
00:22:16.54 --> 00:22:17.90
And the Air Force took me.

476
00:22:17.90 --> 00:22:25.26
So, but the, when was the question?

477
00:22:25.26 --> 00:22:26.54
Well, that was the question.

478
00:22:26.54 --> 00:22:29.02
The question was, how did you first get the idea of how to

479
00:22:29.02 --> 00:22:29.02
fly?

480
00:22:29.02 --> 00:22:31.74
My dad said, see if you learn how to fly.

481
00:22:31.74 --> 00:22:33.18
And he didn't know how to fly.

482
00:22:33.18 --> 00:22:35.90
So did they have like a contract that made you a pilot?

483
00:22:35.90 --> 00:22:39.74
Was that part of the enlistment process?

484
00:22:39.74 --> 00:22:43.98
They only said, we like everything you do.

485
00:22:43.98 --> 00:22:49.70
Now you have to fill out a preference sheet.

486
00:22:49.70 --> 00:22:51.98
And you can put whatever you like in there.

487
00:22:51.98 --> 00:22:55.94
We suggest this list of stuff over here.

488
00:22:55.94 --> 00:23:00.02
And then you make them one, two, and three choices.

489
00:23:00.02 --> 00:23:03.42
I said, well, I want to be a pilot.

490
00:23:03.42 --> 00:23:07.22
Because that's what I'm doing this whole thing for.

491
00:23:07.22 --> 00:23:09.86
He said, well, most people put in navigator for second and

492
00:23:09.86 --> 00:23:13.34
then something like, I don't know, auxiliary

493
00:23:13.34 --> 00:23:15.22
aviation or something like that.

494
00:23:15.22 --> 00:23:17.26
I said, well, that's not why I'm here.

495
00:23:17.26 --> 00:23:20.94
So I put pilot, pilot, pilot, one, two, three.

496
00:23:20.94 --> 00:23:24.46
Funny thing too, the B-52 squadron I was later in, was a

497
00:23:24.46 --> 00:23:26.98
guy from my college class.

498
00:23:26.98 --> 00:23:30.14
And I said, Danny, what are you doing here as a navigator?

499
00:23:30.14 --> 00:23:33.18
He said, well, they told me, put pilot first, navigator

500
00:23:33.18 --> 00:23:34.86
second.

501
00:23:34.86 --> 00:23:37.54
I said, you don't wear glasses or anything.

502
00:23:37.54 --> 00:23:40.50
He said, well, that's what they took me as.

503
00:23:40.50 --> 00:23:42.90
I said, well, I didn't want to rub it in.

504
00:23:42.90 --> 00:23:45.58
So I just let it alone.

505
00:23:45.58 --> 00:23:48.46
So what was your indoctrination to the Air Force then?

506
00:23:48.46 --> 00:23:53.86
I went to their OCS in San Antonio.

507
00:23:53.86 --> 00:23:57.74
It's not at Lackland.

508
00:23:57.74 --> 00:23:59.78
I think they called it the Medina base.

509
00:23:59.78 --> 00:24:01.94
It's nearby.

510
00:24:01.94 --> 00:24:02.90
And I went through that.

511
00:24:02.90 --> 00:24:04.18
That's three months.

512
00:24:04.18 --> 00:24:06.34
Was it a shock to your system?

513
00:24:06.34 --> 00:24:08.70
Were you wondering why the hell you did this?

514
00:24:08.70 --> 00:24:09.90
Well, I was fortunate.

515
00:24:09.90 --> 00:24:15.42
There were several previous enlisted guys there.

516
00:24:15.42 --> 00:24:17.86
And I thought, they know the ropes.

517
00:24:17.86 --> 00:24:19.26
Do whatever they do.

518
00:24:19.26 --> 00:24:22.06
So that's what I did.

519
00:24:22.06 --> 00:24:26.30
And then they said, if you play a musical instrument, put

520
00:24:26.30 --> 00:24:27.42
your name on this list.

521
00:24:27.42 --> 00:24:28.74
And I said, no, no.

522
00:24:28.74 --> 00:24:31.98
Guy told me, don't volunteer for anything.

523
00:24:31.98 --> 00:24:33.66
Before I went in.

524
00:24:33.66 --> 00:24:38.10
So I found out the guy was running this thing.

525
00:24:38.10 --> 00:24:42.14
He loves to have live music for any parades that he has.

526
00:24:42.14 --> 00:24:44.30
And if you can play a musical, get your name on it.

527
00:24:44.30 --> 00:24:45.50
I did.

528
00:24:45.50 --> 00:24:46.30
So there were.

529
00:24:46.30 --> 00:24:47.58
What instrument did you play?

530
00:24:47.58 --> 00:24:50.22
I played the trumpet and cornet.

531
00:24:50.22 --> 00:24:51.34
I played baritone.

532
00:24:51.34 --> 00:24:55.66
I can play alto, or French horn, or any of those.

533
00:24:55.66 --> 00:24:58.34
But I dropped that for a long time in midlife.

534
00:24:58.34 --> 00:25:00.46
I'm back into it now.

535
00:25:00.46 --> 00:25:04.10
Anyway, you got out of everything.

536
00:25:04.10 --> 00:25:09.98
You straightened up your digs and your bed and whatnot.

537
00:25:09.98 --> 00:25:14.78
And when the Saturday morning inspection happened,

538
00:25:14.78 --> 00:25:16.50
we had rehearsal.

539
00:25:16.50 --> 00:25:21.22
And that was they, if you will, all knew that.

540
00:25:21.22 --> 00:25:23.94
So this is, what, 1963?

541
00:25:23.94 --> 00:25:26.30
No, no, 65.

542
00:25:26.30 --> 00:25:27.74
January 65.

543
00:25:27.74 --> 00:25:31.54
Because, see, I graduated in August

544
00:25:31.54 --> 00:25:37.26
because I was having too much fun by that point in college.

545
00:25:37.26 --> 00:25:39.58
You ought to take that professor's history course.

546
00:25:39.58 --> 00:25:41.18
He's really interesting.

547
00:25:41.18 --> 00:25:44.18
And you should take compared to the economic systems,

548
00:25:44.18 --> 00:25:45.46
because you should do that.

549
00:25:45.46 --> 00:25:47.90
And I didn't have enough credits.

550
00:25:47.90 --> 00:25:49.46
I had two.

551
00:25:49.46 --> 00:25:53.30
If you needed 150, I had 175.

552
00:25:53.30 --> 00:25:56.30
But you don't have enough in your major or in your minor.

553
00:25:56.30 --> 00:26:00.06
You took that course and you got good grading.

554
00:26:00.06 --> 00:26:00.58
And you're right.

555
00:26:00.58 --> 00:26:03.46
So I wound up graduating in August.

556
00:26:03.46 --> 00:26:06.06
But how did you get into that?

557
00:26:06.06 --> 00:26:07.34
So it's 1965.

558
00:26:07.34 --> 00:26:09.54
So you're starting to hear about Vietnam.

559
00:26:09.54 --> 00:26:11.50
You guys must be talking about Vietnam.

560
00:26:11.50 --> 00:26:12.46
No, no.

561
00:26:12.46 --> 00:26:21.10
Because that happened in January of 1965.

562
00:26:21.10 --> 00:26:25.18
And summer of 64, I worked through college

563
00:26:25.18 --> 00:26:28.70
at a small summer stock playhouse

564
00:26:28.70 --> 00:26:31.50
because I was in the drama club in college.

565
00:26:31.50 --> 00:26:35.54
And you meet this guy and meet that guy and so forth.

566
00:26:35.54 --> 00:26:39.78
And all very legitimate, if you will, good people,

567
00:26:39.78 --> 00:26:42.74
not these sorts of flaky dumb people

568
00:26:42.74 --> 00:26:49.02
that you might think of when you think of theater sort of people.

569
00:26:49.02 --> 00:26:50.98
And I had a mentor by this point.

570
00:26:50.98 --> 00:26:54.78
A guy from New York was old enough to be my father.

571
00:26:54.78 --> 00:26:58.50
And he said, when you graduate, where are you going to do?

572
00:26:58.50 --> 00:27:00.74
And I said, well, I don't know.

573
00:27:00.74 --> 00:27:06.74
This paperwork and the Air Force to Fly and stuff.

574
00:27:06.74 --> 00:27:10.02
And he said, they were looking for a guy like you

575
00:27:10.02 --> 00:27:14.26
at a theater in Baltimore that I am going to, he said.

576
00:27:14.26 --> 00:27:15.98
Should I mention you to them?

577
00:27:15.98 --> 00:27:18.74
And I said, well, OK.

578
00:27:18.74 --> 00:27:21.62
So he called me in about a week or so.

579
00:27:21.62 --> 00:27:24.66
And he said, they want 15 minutes of drama

580
00:27:24.66 --> 00:27:28.94
and 15 minutes of comedy if you can do that.

581
00:27:28.94 --> 00:27:31.02
They want to talk to you.

582
00:27:31.02 --> 00:27:36.22
So I went to a woman in the summer stock company, Grace

583
00:27:36.22 --> 00:27:37.78
Chapman, wonderful woman.

584
00:27:37.78 --> 00:27:39.10
And I said, can you help me?

585
00:27:39.10 --> 00:27:40.10
And she did.

586
00:27:40.10 --> 00:27:41.54
I said, I want to do it like this.

587
00:27:41.54 --> 00:27:42.54
And she said, no, no, no.

588
00:27:42.54 --> 00:27:46.26
We're going to do it this way and so forth.

589
00:27:46.26 --> 00:27:48.98
So rehearsed it with her.

590
00:27:48.98 --> 00:27:51.42
Have to memorize everything, of course.

591
00:27:51.42 --> 00:27:56.70
Did all that and went down to Baltimore, stood up on the stage.

592
00:27:56.70 --> 00:27:58.06
Lights.

593
00:27:58.06 --> 00:27:58.98
And they've got what?

594
00:27:58.98 --> 00:28:01.50
A few people are watching you to judge you?

595
00:28:01.50 --> 00:28:03.46
The two bosses sitting in the city.

596
00:28:03.46 --> 00:28:06.22
And they're thinking of giving you some kind of a role?

597
00:28:06.22 --> 00:28:09.90
No, they had a program there where you actually

598
00:28:09.90 --> 00:28:16.02
worked as a, in the union deal, the actors union.

599
00:28:16.02 --> 00:28:17.98
It's called Actors Equity.

600
00:28:17.98 --> 00:28:21.66
You work as a local jobber and it's called.

601
00:28:21.66 --> 00:28:22.86
Doing what?

602
00:28:22.86 --> 00:28:23.70
What's your job?

603
00:28:23.70 --> 00:28:26.58
Well, they've got you.

604
00:28:26.58 --> 00:28:29.14
They've got you by the short hairs, as they say.

605
00:28:29.14 --> 00:28:34.10
And you will get role.

606
00:28:34.10 --> 00:28:37.74
Maybe the minor, maybe you were just a walk on for this one.

607
00:28:37.74 --> 00:28:39.58
And maybe something serious.

608
00:28:39.58 --> 00:28:42.38
I got one very nice role out of it.

609
00:28:42.38 --> 00:28:48.90
I was the elder son in Galileo by Bertolt Brecht.

610
00:28:48.90 --> 00:28:53.38
He was a notable European communist.

611
00:28:53.38 --> 00:28:59.54
But a good director there for that, John Marley, the guy who,

612
00:28:59.54 --> 00:29:07.06
a lot of people, he was a workhorse, a Hollywood movie actor.

613
00:29:07.06 --> 00:29:12.90
He was the guy in bed with a horse during the first Godfather

614
00:29:12.90 --> 00:29:13.70
film.

615
00:29:13.70 --> 00:29:16.94
That was John Marley and a nice man as well.

616
00:29:16.94 --> 00:29:18.02
Anyway.

617
00:29:18.02 --> 00:29:20.54
So wait, so this was in the summertime you were doing this?

618
00:29:20.54 --> 00:29:24.50
Summer stock in a barn, believe it or not, in Pennsylvania.

619
00:29:24.50 --> 00:29:29.34
And then Jerry Richards was a New York guy, old enough to be my dad,

620
00:29:29.34 --> 00:29:34.70
said he was going to this equity company in Baltimore,

621
00:29:34.70 --> 00:29:37.14
relatively new, called Center Stage.

622
00:29:37.14 --> 00:29:39.26
It's still active today.

623
00:29:39.26 --> 00:29:42.46
And was I interested, did you have another thing in mind?

624
00:29:42.46 --> 00:29:44.98
And I went back and I said to my mother,

625
00:29:44.98 --> 00:29:47.02
been passing, I was thinking about this.

626
00:29:47.02 --> 00:29:50.18
She said, do what you have to do, all right?

627
00:29:50.18 --> 00:29:54.74
So I hitchhiked once again.

628
00:29:54.74 --> 00:29:55.58
To Baltimore.

629
00:29:55.58 --> 00:29:56.10
To Baltimore.

630
00:29:56.10 --> 00:29:58.34
And how long did you stay in Baltimore for?

631
00:29:58.34 --> 00:30:04.30
Only until I got a big fat envelope in the mail from DoD.

632
00:30:04.30 --> 00:30:08.22
And it said, we will teach you to fly if you want to.

633
00:30:08.22 --> 00:30:10.22
And of course, the draft was there.

634
00:30:10.22 --> 00:30:13.46
And I had already called the draft board and I said,

635
00:30:13.46 --> 00:30:14.50
where am I?

636
00:30:14.50 --> 00:30:17.54
And they said, we can't tell you by the law.

637
00:30:17.54 --> 00:30:21.42
But I'll tell you this, you're close to the front of the drawer.

638
00:30:21.42 --> 00:30:23.46
I remember that very well.

639
00:30:23.46 --> 00:30:25.74
I thought, I've got to do something about this.

640
00:30:25.74 --> 00:30:27.42
I wonder what to do about this.

641
00:30:27.42 --> 00:30:31.98
And I went to a fellow guy who was in the same position

642
00:30:31.98 --> 00:30:33.74
I was in the company.

643
00:30:33.74 --> 00:30:35.70
And I said, I don't know what to do.

644
00:30:35.70 --> 00:30:37.34
And he said, do what I did.

645
00:30:37.34 --> 00:30:41.50
Tell them you like boys, not girls.

646
00:30:41.50 --> 00:30:43.94
I said, that's not true.

647
00:30:43.94 --> 00:30:45.62
He said, it's not true with me either.

648
00:30:45.62 --> 00:30:46.50
But it got me right.

649
00:30:46.50 --> 00:30:48.70
They could go sit on the bench over there.

650
00:30:48.70 --> 00:30:52.10
And they asked, do you really like boys rather than girls?

651
00:30:52.10 --> 00:30:54.78
And he said, I just said, that's right.

652
00:30:54.78 --> 00:30:55.30
I do.

653
00:30:55.30 --> 00:30:57.18
And that was the end of that.

654
00:30:57.18 --> 00:30:57.78
And I got off.

655
00:30:57.78 --> 00:30:59.78
I said, oh, boy.

656
00:30:59.78 --> 00:31:01.82
That may be good advice some ways.

657
00:31:01.82 --> 00:31:03.78
But I thought somewhere down the road,

658
00:31:03.78 --> 00:31:07.86
somebody's going to drag that out 40 years from now.

659
00:31:07.86 --> 00:31:09.46
And so I didn't want to do that.

660
00:31:09.46 --> 00:31:11.82
And lo and behold, I get this big fat envelope in my mouth.

661
00:31:11.82 --> 00:31:15.02
I go to Jerry Richards, my mentor.

662
00:31:15.02 --> 00:31:15.86
I said, what should I do?

663
00:31:15.86 --> 00:31:20.62
He said, he was a combat veteran of World War II.

664
00:31:20.62 --> 00:31:23.46
A dog-faced soldier had funny stories

665
00:31:23.46 --> 00:31:28.30
to tell about being on a line of March, hot, sweaty,

666
00:31:28.30 --> 00:31:33.54
and an Italian farmer going by with a wooden tank

667
00:31:33.54 --> 00:31:37.86
on a little wagon pulled by a horse.

668
00:31:37.86 --> 00:31:41.14
And the second lieutenant, whoever it was,

669
00:31:41.14 --> 00:31:43.34
said, stay away from that tank.

670
00:31:43.34 --> 00:31:49.14
We all knew it was full of wine or grape juice anyway.

671
00:31:49.14 --> 00:31:52.50
And he said, we got two thirds of the line through there.

672
00:31:52.50 --> 00:31:54.62
And somebody went, boom, boom, boom.

673
00:31:54.62 --> 00:31:56.22
And that was it.

674
00:31:56.22 --> 00:31:57.78
Everything collapsed.

675
00:31:57.78 --> 00:32:00.06
Anyway, super nice guy.

676
00:32:00.06 --> 00:32:01.94
And I went to Jerry.

677
00:32:01.94 --> 00:32:03.62
And I said, what should I do about this?

678
00:32:03.62 --> 00:32:06.38
And he said, well, you always come back to this,

679
00:32:06.38 --> 00:32:08.66
but you're never getting another chance to do that.

680
00:32:08.66 --> 00:32:11.42
So I signed on the dotted line.

681
00:32:11.42 --> 00:32:18.42
And I went into the Air Force on the 2nd of January, 1975.

682
00:32:18.42 --> 00:32:19.50
1965.

683
00:32:19.50 --> 00:32:21.34
65.

684
00:32:21.34 --> 00:32:22.34
Yeah, 65.

685
00:32:22.34 --> 00:32:23.06
He said, 75.

686
00:32:23.06 --> 00:32:24.06
That's right.

687
00:32:24.06 --> 00:32:24.62
65.

688
00:32:24.62 --> 00:32:26.98
So yeah, so that early part of Vietnam.

689
00:32:26.98 --> 00:32:30.06
Because I always think in a way the news kind of worked.

690
00:32:30.06 --> 00:32:33.14
It was the battle of the I-Dreng Valley in 1965

691
00:32:33.14 --> 00:32:34.90
where it really hit the news.

692
00:32:34.90 --> 00:32:36.10
And there was casualties.

693
00:32:36.10 --> 00:32:40.78
And it seemed like the escalation really kind of started.

694
00:32:40.78 --> 00:32:45.02
So you get done with the Officer Candidate School.

695
00:32:45.02 --> 00:32:47.70
And then you get your slot to flight school?

696
00:32:47.70 --> 00:32:48.34
Right.

697
00:32:48.34 --> 00:32:52.90
And that was at Webb Air Force Base in West Texas,

698
00:32:52.90 --> 00:32:56.46
at Big Spring, Texas.

699
00:32:56.46 --> 00:33:01.18
Pretty much of a barren place, just east of the big, big oil

700
00:33:01.18 --> 00:33:02.14
fields.

701
00:33:02.14 --> 00:33:05.18
But there were plenty of oil wells around where I was,

702
00:33:05.18 --> 00:33:06.46
around Big Spring.

703
00:33:06.46 --> 00:33:13.90
But the big oil fields around Midland and Odessa, Texas.

704
00:33:13.90 --> 00:33:17.02
Permium Basin, it's called.

705
00:33:17.02 --> 00:33:22.46
And there had been at least one crash at Big Spring, Texas.

706
00:33:22.46 --> 00:33:24.74
They made a very big deal out of it, and rightly so.

707
00:33:24.74 --> 00:33:28.82
The guy was confused about stars and oil fields.

708
00:33:28.82 --> 00:33:32.22
Every drilling, not their drilling rig,

709
00:33:32.22 --> 00:33:36.34
but every pumping deal has its own light bulb on it.

710
00:33:36.34 --> 00:33:38.46
And he got confused and rolled over.

711
00:33:38.46 --> 00:33:39.74
To your shame.

712
00:33:39.74 --> 00:33:41.90
Yeah, so really ashamed.

713
00:33:41.90 --> 00:33:45.46
But I learned to fly there and then went to the.

714
00:33:45.46 --> 00:33:46.34
How was flight school?

715
00:33:49.50 --> 00:33:53.94
It was tough for me at first because I didn't know a wing

716
00:33:53.94 --> 00:33:58.54
from a tail, an aileron from an elevator, anything.

717
00:33:58.54 --> 00:34:02.10
And about half those guys had private licenses.

718
00:34:02.10 --> 00:34:06.06
At least half of them had private licenses.

719
00:34:06.06 --> 00:34:10.46
And a couple of them had commercial multi-engines.

720
00:34:10.46 --> 00:34:13.14
They weren't just walking through the thing.

721
00:34:13.14 --> 00:34:15.78
But I was slow to get going.

722
00:34:15.78 --> 00:34:19.62
But when I got into the second half, which was the T-38

723
00:34:19.62 --> 00:34:22.74
at that time, I did very well.

724
00:34:22.74 --> 00:34:29.02
But it's like a baseball player trying to bring his average

725
00:34:29.02 --> 00:34:31.98
up the second half of the season.

726
00:34:31.98 --> 00:34:35.98
So your grade point average was a problem for me.

727
00:34:35.98 --> 00:34:41.22
And I wound up getting a B-52 assignment.

728
00:34:41.22 --> 00:34:45.26
My roommates got C-130s, which was a very desirable deal.

729
00:34:45.26 --> 00:34:46.94
If you didn't want to get shot at,

730
00:34:46.94 --> 00:34:50.18
it turned out to be very foolish.

731
00:34:50.18 --> 00:34:55.54
Because in C-130, you got shot at in the Vietnam War.

732
00:34:55.54 --> 00:35:02.38
And one of my roommates got Air Defense Command F-104,

733
00:35:02.38 --> 00:35:05.70
which was considered to be creme de la creme,

734
00:35:05.70 --> 00:35:10.06
until I got assigned to the F-4.

735
00:35:10.06 --> 00:35:12.22
But first, you had to do your B-52 time.

736
00:35:12.22 --> 00:35:12.72
Right.

737
00:35:12.72 --> 00:35:15.86
The G-Model in Rome, New York, wonderful place,

738
00:35:15.86 --> 00:35:17.26
wonderful people there.

739
00:35:17.26 --> 00:35:20.82
I liked everything about it except sitting alert.

740
00:35:20.82 --> 00:35:21.98
Awful.

741
00:35:21.98 --> 00:35:25.70
So this is now what, 1966 or so?

742
00:35:25.70 --> 00:35:26.90
Yeah, that's right.

743
00:35:26.90 --> 00:35:31.90
And you're assigned to the B-52 squadron in Rome, New York.

744
00:35:31.90 --> 00:35:32.98
Yeah.

745
00:35:32.98 --> 00:35:35.98
Very heavily decorated squadron from World War II.

746
00:35:35.98 --> 00:35:40.18
I can't remember the number, 488 or something like that.

747
00:35:40.18 --> 00:35:43.22
Eighth Air Force.

748
00:35:43.22 --> 00:35:49.98
I had the first guy they put me with was a guy of shorter stature.

749
00:35:49.98 --> 00:35:52.02
And I think he had a problem about that.

750
00:35:52.02 --> 00:35:54.14
And I was six feet tall and whatnot.

751
00:35:54.14 --> 00:35:58.66
And all the way down to him saying, I said, that's not so.

752
00:35:58.66 --> 00:35:59.62
He said, it is so.

753
00:35:59.62 --> 00:36:01.34
And you shut up because I'm a major.

754
00:36:01.34 --> 00:36:04.50
And you're just a goddamn first lieutenant.

755
00:36:04.50 --> 00:36:06.58
Whoa, OK.

756
00:36:06.58 --> 00:36:09.94
But at any rate, he fired me, so to speak, basically.

757
00:36:09.94 --> 00:36:12.06
He didn't want to fly with me anymore

758
00:36:12.06 --> 00:36:16.30
because I may have made better landings than he did.

759
00:36:16.30 --> 00:36:18.58
Because the next guy I got was a family man.

760
00:36:18.58 --> 00:36:20.70
And we got along like brothers.

761
00:36:20.70 --> 00:36:21.62
And it was great.

762
00:36:21.62 --> 00:36:24.34
So the one lead pilot or whatever it was called,

763
00:36:24.34 --> 00:36:25.98
the lead pilot, the major?

764
00:36:25.98 --> 00:36:26.90
Yeah.

765
00:36:26.90 --> 00:36:28.70
He didn't like flying with you.

766
00:36:28.70 --> 00:36:29.22
Right.

767
00:36:29.22 --> 00:36:30.74
Well, he didn't like your attitude or something.

768
00:36:30.74 --> 00:36:32.38
And he didn't like my attitude either.

769
00:36:32.38 --> 00:36:33.58
So he got rid of you.

770
00:36:33.58 --> 00:36:33.90
Right.

771
00:36:33.90 --> 00:36:35.34
But then you just moved to another guy?

772
00:36:35.34 --> 00:36:35.82
Yeah.

773
00:36:35.82 --> 00:36:38.18
Well, they gave me another guy.

774
00:36:38.18 --> 00:36:39.58
You don't have any choice about it.

775
00:36:39.58 --> 00:36:42.06
But we got along.

776
00:36:42.06 --> 00:36:43.86
Had fun every day.

777
00:36:43.86 --> 00:36:46.66
And what's the deal with sitting alert?

778
00:36:46.66 --> 00:36:51.78
Well, they did it two different ways.

779
00:36:51.78 --> 00:36:55.42
At Romney Arc, where I was, they had eight airplanes

780
00:36:55.42 --> 00:36:58.66
on alert at any one time.

781
00:36:58.66 --> 00:37:03.66
All the airplanes that I was on had two Hound dogs stand off

782
00:37:03.66 --> 00:37:08.26
missiles with thermonuclear weapons in them.

783
00:37:08.26 --> 00:37:10.82
The Mark 28 at that time.

784
00:37:10.82 --> 00:37:13.74
I don't think it's classified anymore.

785
00:37:13.74 --> 00:37:20.38
But the highest yield on those, single warhead per.

786
00:37:20.38 --> 00:37:24.74
And there was a pop on there.

787
00:37:24.74 --> 00:37:28.98
And then four thermonuclear weapons in the Bombay.

788
00:37:28.98 --> 00:37:34.42
And then four Quail decoy missiles in the Bombay.

789
00:37:34.42 --> 00:37:41.06
And the targets for the ones I was on, well, I was on a

790
00:37:41.06 --> 00:37:45.02
mission that was downtown Moscow, believe it or not, and

791
00:37:45.02 --> 00:37:46.66
land in Turkey.

792
00:37:46.66 --> 00:37:49.50
I think all of the ones I was on were land in Turkey.

793
00:37:49.50 --> 00:37:50.94
Because you were out of fuel.

794
00:37:50.94 --> 00:37:54.94
By then you were fueled south of Iceland.

795
00:37:54.94 --> 00:38:01.14
And then went in and then turned straight south and landed

796
00:38:01.14 --> 00:38:06.82
on an abandoned airfield in central Turkey.

797
00:38:06.82 --> 00:38:11.42
And you were instructed to get fuel by Jerry Can.

798
00:38:11.42 --> 00:38:12.54
This is silly.

799
00:38:12.54 --> 00:38:13.30
And we knew it.

800
00:38:16.58 --> 00:38:18.06
Jerry Can was not enough.

801
00:38:18.06 --> 00:38:21.78
He had eight J57s and a B52.

802
00:38:21.78 --> 00:38:27.90
And H model had modified J57s that were fan jet engines.

803
00:38:27.90 --> 00:38:28.78
But it was silly.

804
00:38:28.78 --> 00:38:33.62
You'd never forget enough fuel to refuel the thing, to fly

805
00:38:33.62 --> 00:38:34.50
it anywhere.

806
00:38:34.50 --> 00:38:37.74
So I mean, was that just because once you flew over Moscow

807
00:38:37.74 --> 00:38:40.34
and dropped nuclear weapons, it wouldn't really matter where

808
00:38:40.34 --> 00:38:40.74
you were getting?

809
00:38:40.74 --> 00:38:41.46
What was the?

810
00:38:41.46 --> 00:38:41.98
Pretty much.

811
00:38:41.98 --> 00:38:45.38
Because you're assuming that the world would be a conflagration

812
00:38:45.38 --> 00:38:48.38
and would be pretty much of a mess.

813
00:38:48.38 --> 00:38:52.30
But at that point, you would truly a thermonuclear war

814
00:38:52.30 --> 00:38:56.90
would have finished by that time, I guess.

815
00:38:56.90 --> 00:39:00.50
And everything would be an awful, awful mess.

816
00:39:00.50 --> 00:39:05.22
And are you sitting, like are the weapons loaded on the aircraft?

817
00:39:05.22 --> 00:39:05.94
Just sit there, stage?

818
00:39:05.94 --> 00:39:06.70
Absolutely.

819
00:39:06.70 --> 00:39:10.26
Positively with an armed guard on every airplane.

820
00:39:10.26 --> 00:39:14.14
Walking around underneath every airplane 24 hours a day.

821
00:39:14.14 --> 00:39:18.06
Was there any events that would heighten your readiness?

822
00:39:18.06 --> 00:39:28.42
They would have practice alerts that could happen at any time.

823
00:39:28.42 --> 00:39:32.82
SAC, World Strategic Air Command, worldwide,

824
00:39:32.82 --> 00:39:34.18
would call an alert.

825
00:39:34.18 --> 00:39:39.22
And every SAC base on the planet, even in obscure places,

826
00:39:39.22 --> 00:39:44.54
would do what they were told to do.

827
00:39:44.54 --> 00:39:48.06
And they basically had three commands.

828
00:39:48.06 --> 00:39:53.18
One, to man the airplanes and start them at stay in place.

829
00:39:53.18 --> 00:39:58.46
Second, start the airplanes and taxi down the runway,

830
00:39:58.46 --> 00:40:02.66
just motivate the flying machines.

831
00:40:02.66 --> 00:40:04.78
And third would be a real launch.

832
00:40:04.78 --> 00:40:06.70
Actually, there were two kinds of launches,

833
00:40:06.70 --> 00:40:13.10
launch to a holding point short of total commitment.

834
00:40:13.10 --> 00:40:18.02
Or four, total commitment from minute one.

835
00:40:18.02 --> 00:40:23.66
So obviously, the third and fourth never happened with me.

836
00:40:27.54 --> 00:40:31.58
The alert was at Rome New York, at Griffiths Air Force Base

837
00:40:31.58 --> 00:40:32.82
of Orange, is where I was.

838
00:40:32.82 --> 00:40:36.90
And wonderful people there, too, was seven days.

839
00:40:36.90 --> 00:40:38.30
You had seven days on.

840
00:40:38.30 --> 00:40:41.54
And the rules were half your time on alert.

841
00:40:41.54 --> 00:40:43.90
You had three.

842
00:40:43.90 --> 00:40:46.14
But it didn't really work out that way,

843
00:40:46.14 --> 00:40:51.26
because you didn't get away from the base until, in this case,

844
00:40:51.26 --> 00:40:55.06
Thursday, 12 o'clock or something like that.

845
00:40:55.06 --> 00:40:57.98
And you lost half the day.

846
00:40:57.98 --> 00:41:03.50
And then they would schedule you for a flight, maybe,

847
00:41:03.50 --> 00:41:07.78
Monday night at 8 PM.

848
00:41:07.78 --> 00:41:11.70
So Monday was sort of gone, because you had to sleep,

849
00:41:11.70 --> 00:41:14.58
because you were going to fly for 12 hours.

850
00:41:14.58 --> 00:41:17.46
You took off at 8 PM, you were going to land at 8 o'clock

851
00:41:17.46 --> 00:41:18.78
Tuesday morning.

852
00:41:18.78 --> 00:41:23.50
All those missions, those training missions, were eight hours.

853
00:41:23.50 --> 00:41:27.54
But training missions were sort of fun and interesting.

854
00:41:27.54 --> 00:41:29.54
I spent a lot of time with my hands in my lap.

855
00:41:29.54 --> 00:41:33.06
But nevertheless, they were interesting.

856
00:41:33.06 --> 00:41:35.30
And you went all over the United States,

857
00:41:35.30 --> 00:41:38.98
all over the United States doing those things.

858
00:41:38.98 --> 00:41:40.90
And a lot of them were at low level,

859
00:41:40.90 --> 00:41:44.86
because that's what you would do in the case of a nuclear war.

860
00:41:44.86 --> 00:41:46.66
Oh, it's a low-level attack?

861
00:41:46.66 --> 00:41:47.90
Oh, yes.

862
00:41:47.90 --> 00:41:54.22
The B-52s were all assigned a low altitude.

863
00:41:54.22 --> 00:41:55.22
Like how low?

864
00:41:55.22 --> 00:41:57.30
200 feet.

865
00:41:57.30 --> 00:41:59.10
That's good, underneath radar?

866
00:41:59.10 --> 00:42:00.18
Right.

867
00:42:00.18 --> 00:42:01.14
Yeah.

868
00:42:01.14 --> 00:42:04.26
As low as you want to go is what I was told.

869
00:42:04.26 --> 00:42:07.14
I said, this is a poker deck route,

870
00:42:07.14 --> 00:42:09.58
and it's published at 400 feet.

871
00:42:09.58 --> 00:42:14.66
How low are we talking about here if we actually do have a war?

872
00:42:14.66 --> 00:42:17.02
As low as you want to go.

873
00:42:17.02 --> 00:42:22.82
I said, one point, you have charts that were accurate,

874
00:42:22.82 --> 00:42:26.34
accurate, and classified, obviously.

875
00:42:26.34 --> 00:42:31.46
But I said to one of the guys who worked in the vault,

876
00:42:31.46 --> 00:42:34.46
you had to target study while you were on alert.

877
00:42:34.46 --> 00:42:38.14
And I said, you show telephone poles here.

878
00:42:38.14 --> 00:42:43.14
Here I am to co-pilot, looking for the next turn.

879
00:42:43.14 --> 00:42:45.66
Can I count those telephone poles?

880
00:42:45.66 --> 00:42:46.94
Yes, you can.

881
00:42:46.94 --> 00:42:50.42
Whoa, they were all done by U2 or by satellite.

882
00:42:50.42 --> 00:42:54.74
I think the satellites were just starting at that time.

883
00:42:54.74 --> 00:42:59.46
So I said, so it would be the 28th telephone pole.

884
00:42:59.46 --> 00:43:03.06
I can turn left to 030.

885
00:43:03.06 --> 00:43:04.46
Yep.

886
00:43:04.46 --> 00:43:08.10
Anyway, so what was the question?

887
00:43:08.10 --> 00:43:09.34
Where would the heck we're going?

888
00:43:09.34 --> 00:43:12.10
Well, it's very interesting to hear

889
00:43:12.10 --> 00:43:16.78
sort of what your status was as a pilot.

890
00:43:16.78 --> 00:43:19.74
And I actually asked you what level of alert, what's

891
00:43:19.74 --> 00:43:21.38
the highest level of alert you are?

892
00:43:21.38 --> 00:43:23.82
Because obviously, you missed the Cuban missile crisis.

893
00:43:23.82 --> 00:43:24.22
That's right.

894
00:43:24.22 --> 00:43:27.34
Because I'm sure that would have been a very high alert.

895
00:43:27.34 --> 00:43:28.34
Right.

896
00:43:28.34 --> 00:43:29.86
Do you think they got airborne for that?

897
00:43:29.86 --> 00:43:30.94
I don't think so.

898
00:43:30.94 --> 00:43:31.94
I don't think so.

899
00:43:31.94 --> 00:43:34.98
I don't remember ever asking anybody.

900
00:43:34.98 --> 00:43:37.34
But I don't think that that happened.

901
00:43:37.34 --> 00:43:37.94
No.

902
00:43:37.94 --> 00:43:43.02
And that had to be a little bit of a strange weight

903
00:43:43.02 --> 00:43:46.22
on your shoulders to think about, especially

904
00:43:46.22 --> 00:43:48.66
with your background, with your English teacher that

905
00:43:48.66 --> 00:43:51.86
didn't like the atomic bombs dropped on Japan.

906
00:43:51.86 --> 00:43:52.36
Right.

907
00:43:52.36 --> 00:43:54.30
And here you are with a mission tasking

908
00:43:54.30 --> 00:43:56.66
that if you get this mission, you're

909
00:43:56.66 --> 00:44:01.14
going to fly and annihilate basically the world.

910
00:44:01.14 --> 00:44:03.86
Well, I have a little bit of a funny story about it.

911
00:44:03.86 --> 00:44:05.34
Let's hear about that.

912
00:44:05.34 --> 00:44:06.50
Turns into a funny story.

913
00:44:06.50 --> 00:44:07.14
I like that.

914
00:44:07.14 --> 00:44:10.42
In the G and the H, we had the gunner up front.

915
00:44:10.42 --> 00:44:12.30
And the guns that were in the tail.

916
00:44:12.30 --> 00:44:15.30
So these are the G and H models of the B-52.

917
00:44:15.30 --> 00:44:16.14
Right.

918
00:44:16.14 --> 00:44:18.54
Up to that, the gunner rode in the tail.

919
00:44:18.54 --> 00:44:21.30
And if he were to bail out, he would

920
00:44:21.30 --> 00:44:25.34
jettison his turret, which weighed something like 2,000

921
00:44:25.34 --> 00:44:26.38
pounds, everything.

922
00:44:26.38 --> 00:44:32.10
His ammunition and his 50 calibers and everything short

923
00:44:32.10 --> 00:44:33.42
of the seat.

924
00:44:33.42 --> 00:44:36.38
He sat on a chemical toilet back there, incidentally.

925
00:44:36.38 --> 00:44:38.42
But then he would bail out.

926
00:44:38.42 --> 00:44:41.22
He did not have an ejection seat.

927
00:44:41.22 --> 00:44:42.86
It was right in front of his toes.

928
00:44:42.86 --> 00:44:45.30
And he just stepped forward or leaned forward now

929
00:44:45.30 --> 00:44:48.58
to win with a conventional parachute.

930
00:44:48.58 --> 00:44:54.98
Anyway, the gunner and the G and the H models up front.

931
00:44:54.98 --> 00:44:58.98
And the cockpit arrangement is different in the G and the H

932
00:44:58.98 --> 00:45:04.06
than it was in the earlier, up to the F model, B-52.

933
00:45:04.06 --> 00:45:05.70
The G's no longer exist.

934
00:45:05.70 --> 00:45:10.86
They went with the strategic arms limitation treaty.

935
00:45:10.86 --> 00:45:14.06
And the G's got their pictures of them getting their wings

936
00:45:14.06 --> 00:45:18.70
cut off that they took airborne pictures of all that.

937
00:45:18.70 --> 00:45:21.86
So comply with the Russians.

938
00:45:21.86 --> 00:45:22.42
The Soviets?

939
00:45:22.42 --> 00:45:23.74
Yeah.

940
00:45:23.74 --> 00:45:24.58
But at any rate.

941
00:45:24.58 --> 00:45:26.86
The G and the H internally are the same.

942
00:45:26.86 --> 00:45:33.34
And the ECM officer and the gunner ride facing backwards.

943
00:45:33.34 --> 00:45:37.30
And now it was going to.

944
00:45:37.30 --> 00:45:37.98
Oh, yeah.

945
00:45:37.98 --> 00:45:43.18
So on your charts, when you do your first day of alert target

946
00:45:43.18 --> 00:45:47.06
study, it's the same charts every time.

947
00:45:47.06 --> 00:45:49.66
The gunners, you sit across the table.

948
00:45:49.66 --> 00:45:55.02
And I said, oh, you have LPBN.

949
00:45:55.02 --> 00:45:56.14
That means something.

950
00:45:56.14 --> 00:46:03.74
And E35, that means something across the route of flight.

951
00:46:03.74 --> 00:46:06.58
And I said, LPBO.

952
00:46:06.58 --> 00:46:12.02
In the same lettering, stencil, same ink, same everything.

953
00:46:12.02 --> 00:46:14.62
I said, what's LPBO?

954
00:46:14.62 --> 00:46:18.86
He said, last point of bailout.

955
00:46:18.86 --> 00:46:20.34
That's over Finland.

956
00:46:20.34 --> 00:46:21.54
He said, exactly right.

957
00:46:21.54 --> 00:46:23.34
I'm not going to anybody's nuclear war.

958
00:46:23.34 --> 00:46:24.50
I'm leaving.

959
00:46:24.50 --> 00:46:25.86
I'm over Finland.

960
00:46:25.86 --> 00:46:29.06
I'm taking the seat pack with me with the.22 rifle,

961
00:46:29.06 --> 00:46:31.10
the sleeping bag, and everything.

962
00:46:31.10 --> 00:46:34.38
I'm out of here.

963
00:46:34.38 --> 00:46:36.94
But it never happened.

964
00:46:36.94 --> 00:46:40.66
He was an E6 enlisted guy.

965
00:46:40.66 --> 00:46:42.82
And nice family man and everything else.

966
00:46:42.82 --> 00:46:44.30
But he said, I'm not going to nuclear war.

967
00:46:44.30 --> 00:46:46.14
You're nuts.

968
00:46:46.14 --> 00:46:48.50
So how long did you do this job for?

969
00:46:48.50 --> 00:46:49.18
A year.

970
00:46:49.18 --> 00:46:55.30
Well, including the RAG, if you will, in Merced, California,

971
00:46:55.30 --> 00:46:56.90
a year and a half.

972
00:46:56.90 --> 00:47:00.90
But then I got the big fat envelope that said,

973
00:47:00.90 --> 00:47:03.02
here is your interservice transfer.

974
00:47:03.02 --> 00:47:05.22
If you want to do this, you can do this.

975
00:47:05.22 --> 00:47:06.82
And that's what you had applied for?

976
00:47:06.82 --> 00:47:07.14
Right.

977
00:47:07.14 --> 00:47:10.22
And why did you try and do an interservice transfer

978
00:47:10.22 --> 00:47:11.46
to the Navy?

979
00:47:11.46 --> 00:47:13.98
Because I didn't want two sides to that.

980
00:47:13.98 --> 00:47:17.10
And there's popping your peas again there.

981
00:47:17.10 --> 00:47:20.82
I didn't want to sit alert anymore.

982
00:47:20.82 --> 00:47:26.30
I didn't like riding around with my hands in my lap.

983
00:47:26.30 --> 00:47:31.74
And going way back, I had this idea in the back of my head.

984
00:47:31.74 --> 00:47:36.46
My first cross country in the T-37 out of Web Air Force Base,

985
00:47:36.46 --> 00:47:39.58
we stopped somewhere I can't remember.

986
00:47:39.58 --> 00:47:43.66
And there were two Navy guys there wearing golf shirts

987
00:47:43.66 --> 00:47:47.58
underneath their flight suits.

988
00:47:47.58 --> 00:47:51.42
And through the open door, there were two A4s parked out there.

989
00:47:51.42 --> 00:47:56.06
And they said something like USS Independence or USS,

990
00:47:56.06 --> 00:47:58.42
who knows, Forest Hall or who knows what.

991
00:47:58.42 --> 00:48:01.78
I thought, isn't that hot stuff?

992
00:48:01.78 --> 00:48:05.70
These guys can go to sea with those things and go,

993
00:48:05.70 --> 00:48:08.46
I don't know, anywhere they want.

994
00:48:08.46 --> 00:48:09.82
That's hot.

995
00:48:09.82 --> 00:48:15.46
And then I saw the back of a proceedings magazine.

996
00:48:15.46 --> 00:48:17.94
Proceedings used to be magazine size.

997
00:48:17.94 --> 00:48:21.58
Then it became smaller format.

998
00:48:21.58 --> 00:48:26.06
But it showed an A4 looking over the A4's shoulder,

999
00:48:26.06 --> 00:48:27.98
like the wingman or something like that.

1000
00:48:27.98 --> 00:48:28.54
Looking over it.

1001
00:48:28.54 --> 00:48:30.78
And he's on short final for our carrier.

1002
00:48:30.78 --> 00:48:34.22
And I thought, that's hot shit.

1003
00:48:34.22 --> 00:48:35.42
So that did it.

1004
00:48:35.42 --> 00:48:38.38
And was it hard to put in that interservice transfer?

1005
00:48:38.38 --> 00:48:39.98
It was pretty straightforward.

1006
00:48:39.98 --> 00:48:41.46
Well, they bounced it back at me.

1007
00:48:41.46 --> 00:48:43.70
So no, the carrier format's wrong.

1008
00:48:43.70 --> 00:48:45.26
It has to be this way and that way.

1009
00:48:45.26 --> 00:48:46.14
I have to do that.

1010
00:48:46.14 --> 00:48:48.02
And I said, fine.

1011
00:48:48.02 --> 00:48:49.34
Well, what do you want us to do?

1012
00:48:49.34 --> 00:48:51.78
I said, well, you tell me it's wrong.

1013
00:48:51.78 --> 00:48:56.50
I did it according to what was in the Publications Library.

1014
00:48:56.50 --> 00:48:57.94
You do it.

1015
00:48:57.94 --> 00:48:59.38
I said, well, I guess we have to.

1016
00:48:59.38 --> 00:49:01.06
And they did.

1017
00:49:01.06 --> 00:49:04.50
Then I signed everything the second time and then the way it went.

1018
00:49:04.50 --> 00:49:07.86
And you got straight into the pilot pipeline?

1019
00:49:07.86 --> 00:49:12.74
Well, no, I was, you know, when you're a military officer,

1020
00:49:12.74 --> 00:49:15.94
you are an officer of the United States.

1021
00:49:15.94 --> 00:49:19.26
You're not an Air Force officer or a Navy officer

1022
00:49:19.26 --> 00:49:24.74
or even an officer of the, there's a land survey

1023
00:49:24.74 --> 00:49:27.30
and mapping service.

1024
00:49:27.30 --> 00:49:29.62
They have military uniforms.

1025
00:49:29.62 --> 00:49:33.70
You are an officer of the United States.

1026
00:49:33.70 --> 00:49:37.74
So it isn't like you change services.

1027
00:49:37.74 --> 00:49:40.54
You change uniforms and you change terminology

1028
00:49:40.54 --> 00:49:43.66
and you change verbiage.

1029
00:49:43.66 --> 00:49:49.02
And the name of your grade changes from first lieutenant

1030
00:49:49.02 --> 00:49:50.38
to lieutenant junior grade.

1031
00:49:50.38 --> 00:49:55.14
But they can put you anywhere they want.

1032
00:49:55.14 --> 00:49:58.46
You can be a seal who's a lieutenant commander

1033
00:49:58.46 --> 00:50:00.18
and they can say, guess what?

1034
00:50:00.18 --> 00:50:04.18
We want you in the embassy in Tunisia

1035
00:50:04.18 --> 00:50:06.42
and it's only going to be six months.

1036
00:50:06.42 --> 00:50:08.58
But you'll be wearing civilian clothes

1037
00:50:08.58 --> 00:50:11.38
and you'll be responsible for us and so on, us and so on.

1038
00:50:11.38 --> 00:50:12.58
And that can do that.

1039
00:50:12.58 --> 00:50:15.74
Because remember, you're appointed by the President

1040
00:50:15.74 --> 00:50:18.06
of the United States.

1041
00:50:18.06 --> 00:50:21.54
You're going to serve in that capacity.

1042
00:50:21.54 --> 00:50:23.86
So that's what happens with an inner service transfer.

1043
00:50:23.86 --> 00:50:28.14
And I was told that when you make the transfer,

1044
00:50:28.14 --> 00:50:36.38
it's basically a long table meeting of senior service

1045
00:50:36.38 --> 00:50:40.14
and I have a doc who wants to come over to the Air Force

1046
00:50:40.14 --> 00:50:45.54
and you have a junior lieutenant who wants to go Navy.

1047
00:50:45.54 --> 00:50:47.02
I'll swap you for those two.

1048
00:50:47.02 --> 00:50:47.94
OK, that's fine.

1049
00:50:47.94 --> 00:50:50.30
Let me do that and so forth and so forth.

1050
00:50:50.30 --> 00:50:51.34
And that's the way it's done.

1051
00:50:51.34 --> 00:50:53.62
But every six months or something like that

1052
00:50:53.62 --> 00:50:55.26
and it probably goes on right now.

1053
00:50:55.26 --> 00:50:56.30
I don't know.

1054
00:50:56.30 --> 00:51:00.30
But you ended up with the pilot slot somehow.

1055
00:51:00.30 --> 00:51:05.58
Yeah, well, I had orders to King's, Corpus Christi.

1056
00:51:05.58 --> 00:51:09.62
And I'm standing in a guy's office, nice guy,

1057
00:51:09.62 --> 00:51:13.50
with the Lieutenant Commander,

1058
00:51:13.50 --> 00:51:15.74
a few of the parking ramp with S-2's,

1059
00:51:15.74 --> 00:51:19.02
Stu's parked behind him, pissed an engine,

1060
00:51:19.02 --> 00:51:20.94
had a submarine airplanes.

1061
00:51:20.94 --> 00:51:23.54
It's a training facility for them.

1062
00:51:23.54 --> 00:51:26.10
And a couple of Lieutenant Commander standing over here

1063
00:51:26.10 --> 00:51:30.14
and me standing right here in front of his desk.

1064
00:51:30.14 --> 00:51:31.78
And he said, what are we going to do with you?

1065
00:51:31.78 --> 00:51:33.34
I said, I don't know.

1066
00:51:33.34 --> 00:51:35.02
I just have these orders.

1067
00:51:35.02 --> 00:51:36.74
He said, you flew jets?

1068
00:51:36.74 --> 00:51:38.34
I said, yeah?

1069
00:51:38.34 --> 00:51:40.74
He said, well, then we'll send you to Kingsville.

1070
00:51:40.74 --> 00:51:42.30
What should we do with him?

1071
00:51:42.30 --> 00:51:44.98
What happens if he can't get aboard?

1072
00:51:44.98 --> 00:51:48.66
I thought, I will get aboard.

1073
00:51:48.66 --> 00:51:50.78
So what's Kingsville?

1074
00:51:50.78 --> 00:51:53.34
Kingsville are two advanced training bases.

1075
00:51:53.34 --> 00:51:55.86
I think there is B-ville still active?

1076
00:51:55.86 --> 00:51:57.18
B-ville's close to Kingsville.

1077
00:51:57.18 --> 00:51:59.62
Yeah, and Kingsville is bigger than ever.

1078
00:51:59.62 --> 00:52:01.14
And Navy advanced.

1079
00:52:01.14 --> 00:52:04.26
At that time, there were F-9s there.

1080
00:52:04.26 --> 00:52:07.30
And I went over to Kingsville and introduced myself

1081
00:52:07.30 --> 00:52:09.66
and dropped my orders on the table, and so to speak.

1082
00:52:09.66 --> 00:52:11.10
And all very nice.

1083
00:52:11.10 --> 00:52:13.22
And looked out the window, and they

1084
00:52:13.22 --> 00:52:18.02
had these ancient airplanes, F-9s, Creme War vintage.

1085
00:52:18.02 --> 00:52:20.50
Oh, boy.

1086
00:52:20.50 --> 00:52:24.82
What ancient equipment here.

1087
00:52:24.82 --> 00:52:27.74
There was more fun to fly than you can imagine.

1088
00:52:27.74 --> 00:52:30.62
You put the power up all the way and leave it there.

1089
00:52:30.62 --> 00:52:35.18
And it was like your brother's MG with a little four-cylinder

1090
00:52:35.18 --> 00:52:38.98
engine in it was so much fun to drive, underpowered.

1091
00:52:38.98 --> 00:52:39.78
Same way.

1092
00:52:39.78 --> 00:52:41.90
Fun, fun, fun to fly.

1093
00:52:41.90 --> 00:52:49.46
It was truly a flying airplane with a wing, airfoil wing,

1094
00:52:49.46 --> 00:52:50.18
and everything else.

1095
00:52:50.18 --> 00:52:52.98
You fly, get into the phantom, and you find, no,

1096
00:52:52.98 --> 00:52:54.50
this is a machine.

1097
00:52:54.50 --> 00:52:57.14
Now, at this point, you're hearing about Vietnam.

1098
00:52:57.14 --> 00:53:00.02
Vietnam's now is 19, what, 1967?

1099
00:53:00.02 --> 00:53:00.90
Yeah.

1100
00:53:00.90 --> 00:53:03.26
So now you know what?

1101
00:53:03.26 --> 00:53:04.10
You're in a pipeline.

1102
00:53:04.10 --> 00:53:05.70
Your goal is to be a fighter pilot.

1103
00:53:05.70 --> 00:53:08.30
You know that that pipeline ends up in Vietnam.

1104
00:53:08.30 --> 00:53:09.18
Yeah.

1105
00:53:09.18 --> 00:53:14.50
So your detailer calls you on a whole phone in the BOQ.

1106
00:53:14.50 --> 00:53:17.34
And I think I was a lieutenant by this point.

1107
00:53:17.34 --> 00:53:18.14
Maybe not.

1108
00:53:18.14 --> 00:53:20.02
Senior lieutenant junior grade anyway.

1109
00:53:20.02 --> 00:53:24.22
I had two rooms and a private bath.

1110
00:53:24.22 --> 00:53:28.18
And you were in Kingsville in those?

1111
00:53:28.18 --> 00:53:28.90
I was.

1112
00:53:28.90 --> 00:53:30.74
Big, solid BOQs there.

1113
00:53:30.74 --> 00:53:32.98
Very nice.

1114
00:53:32.98 --> 00:53:37.30
But when you took a shower, the water was so bad,

1115
00:53:37.30 --> 00:53:39.30
the ground water.

1116
00:53:39.30 --> 00:53:41.82
It smelled like ancient sauerkraut.

1117
00:53:41.82 --> 00:53:43.14
Remember that?

1118
00:53:43.14 --> 00:53:44.90
It was awful.

1119
00:53:44.90 --> 00:53:47.90
At any rate, we were OK.

1120
00:53:47.90 --> 00:53:51.58
So at what point do you get assigned to go to the RAG for F-4?

1121
00:53:51.58 --> 00:53:54.90
Well, your detailer calls you on a whole phone of all things.

1122
00:53:54.90 --> 00:53:56.42
And put Tom Copell on.

1123
00:53:56.42 --> 00:53:59.50
He's in room B-7.

1124
00:53:59.50 --> 00:53:59.98
God comes in.

1125
00:53:59.98 --> 00:54:02.58
Hey, Tommy, you got a phone call.

1126
00:54:02.58 --> 00:54:04.02
It's my detailer again.

1127
00:54:04.02 --> 00:54:06.62
He said, Tom, we really want you in the A-6.

1128
00:54:06.62 --> 00:54:08.06
That's just for you.

1129
00:54:08.06 --> 00:54:09.46
Same as the B-52.

1130
00:54:09.46 --> 00:54:12.10
You have experience with offsets and everything else.

1131
00:54:12.10 --> 00:54:14.14
It's going to be perfect.

1132
00:54:14.14 --> 00:54:15.46
I said, I don't want that, Bob.

1133
00:54:15.46 --> 00:54:17.58
You know that.

1134
00:54:17.58 --> 00:54:20.22
Call me back next.

1135
00:54:20.22 --> 00:54:22.22
A series of phone calls.

1136
00:54:22.22 --> 00:54:25.14
The last one was the same thing.

1137
00:54:25.14 --> 00:54:27.58
Tom, you're perfect for the A-6.

1138
00:54:27.58 --> 00:54:30.94
By now, you probably looked around, talked around about it.

1139
00:54:30.94 --> 00:54:32.90
That's a heck of an airplane.

1140
00:54:32.90 --> 00:54:33.86
Yeah, I know, Bob.

1141
00:54:33.86 --> 00:54:36.42
I still want F-4.

1142
00:54:36.42 --> 00:54:37.90
OK.

1143
00:54:37.90 --> 00:54:39.22
Let me think about it.

1144
00:54:39.22 --> 00:54:42.18
And about a week later, a guy called me and said,

1145
00:54:42.18 --> 00:54:44.46
you have orders up there at Admin.

1146
00:54:44.46 --> 00:54:45.62
Big spring at that time.

1147
00:54:45.62 --> 00:54:46.58
I'm sorry.

1148
00:54:46.58 --> 00:54:49.94
Kingsville at that time was nowhere land.

1149
00:54:49.94 --> 00:54:52.30
And I did not have a car.

1150
00:54:52.30 --> 00:54:56.74
I said, it's up at the other end of the main drag,

1151
00:54:56.74 --> 00:55:02.62
the parallel hangar area.

1152
00:55:02.62 --> 00:55:04.38
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk.

1153
00:55:04.38 --> 00:55:07.38
I said, well, first of all, I said, Fred, what do my orders

1154
00:55:07.38 --> 00:55:08.06
say?

1155
00:55:08.06 --> 00:55:09.02
I wouldn't look at them.

1156
00:55:09.02 --> 00:55:10.14
It's none of my business.

1157
00:55:10.14 --> 00:55:14.90
Oh, gentlemen, don't read each other's mail.

1158
00:55:14.90 --> 00:55:16.66
So I'll walk up there and hear what I had.

1159
00:55:16.66 --> 00:55:19.38
F-4 to Marar.

1160
00:55:19.38 --> 00:55:21.82
And the F-4, what year did the F-4 come out?

1161
00:55:21.82 --> 00:55:22.86
What year was that?

1162
00:55:22.86 --> 00:55:26.34
I think the first prototype flew in 58.

1163
00:55:26.34 --> 00:55:27.86
Is that right?

1164
00:55:27.86 --> 00:55:29.22
That sounds about right.

1165
00:55:29.22 --> 00:55:30.34
Just real quick.

1166
00:55:30.34 --> 00:55:31.06
All right.

1167
00:55:31.06 --> 00:55:33.34
So you go through all Air Force training.

1168
00:55:33.34 --> 00:55:34.86
You're a B-52 guy.

1169
00:55:34.86 --> 00:55:37.34
And then you CQ in the F-9?

1170
00:55:37.34 --> 00:55:37.74
Yeah.

1171
00:55:37.74 --> 00:55:40.50
What was that like?

1172
00:55:40.50 --> 00:55:42.70
I mean, they're worried that you can't even get aboard, right?

1173
00:55:42.70 --> 00:55:43.18
Yeah.

1174
00:55:43.18 --> 00:55:43.70
Yeah.

1175
00:55:43.70 --> 00:55:44.58
So what was that like?

1176
00:55:44.58 --> 00:55:48.30
Well, I guess my F-C-L-P was OK.

1177
00:55:48.30 --> 00:55:53.26
And when I first time out, F-C-L-P, I think, this is ball.

1178
00:55:53.26 --> 00:55:54.98
I mean, I can do this and so forth.

1179
00:55:54.98 --> 00:55:57.10
And the guy comes back and he says, well, you were this

1180
00:55:57.10 --> 00:55:58.50
and you were this and you were that.

1181
00:55:58.50 --> 00:55:59.22
That's amazing.

1182
00:55:59.22 --> 00:56:00.74
How do you know that?

1183
00:56:00.74 --> 00:56:02.74
And so forth.

1184
00:56:02.74 --> 00:56:03.66
That's LSOs.

1185
00:56:03.66 --> 00:56:07.02
They grade you accurately.

1186
00:56:07.02 --> 00:56:11.38
And their club, Dave knows this.

1187
00:56:11.38 --> 00:56:13.06
I was in LSO.

1188
00:56:13.06 --> 00:56:14.74
Oh, OK.

1189
00:56:14.74 --> 00:56:16.66
It's hard to get into their club.

1190
00:56:16.66 --> 00:56:20.98
And you can't really dispute what they tell you.

1191
00:56:20.98 --> 00:56:26.26
And after every F-C landing, he's in your ready room saying,

1192
00:56:26.26 --> 00:56:30.06
well, you started out high and so forth and so forth.

1193
00:56:30.06 --> 00:56:31.58
So you guys have now both thrown it.

1194
00:56:31.58 --> 00:56:33.38
I was wondering if I missed something,

1195
00:56:33.38 --> 00:56:35.50
but the term get aboard.

1196
00:56:35.50 --> 00:56:36.86
What does this mean?

1197
00:56:36.86 --> 00:56:38.50
Expand on it.

1198
00:56:38.50 --> 00:56:41.90
There are guys, I guess, who just say, you crazy?

1199
00:56:41.90 --> 00:56:42.94
I'm not going to do that.

1200
00:56:42.94 --> 00:56:45.54
I thought I didn't realize you had to do that.

1201
00:56:45.54 --> 00:56:47.34
Or I guess that's what happens.

1202
00:56:47.34 --> 00:56:51.78
Or they're just what used to be called the guys a plumber.

1203
00:56:51.78 --> 00:56:54.18
And he can't do it.

1204
00:56:54.18 --> 00:56:56.86
So get aboard means you actually qualify in the aircraft?

1205
00:56:56.86 --> 00:57:00.06
Yeah, get aboard is just language for can you land on the ship.

1206
00:57:00.06 --> 00:57:00.54
Right.

1207
00:57:00.54 --> 00:57:01.62
And god.

1208
00:57:01.62 --> 00:57:02.70
Most people can.

1209
00:57:02.70 --> 00:57:03.38
I didn't.

1210
00:57:03.38 --> 00:57:04.10
That's what I was missing.

1211
00:57:04.10 --> 00:57:04.42
Yeah.

1212
00:57:04.42 --> 00:57:05.14
And it's hard.

1213
00:57:05.14 --> 00:57:08.14
It's the phrase of, hey, is this guy going to be able to get a board?

1214
00:57:08.14 --> 00:57:10.02
Meaning can he land his plane on the boat?

1215
00:57:10.02 --> 00:57:10.34
Right.

1216
00:57:10.34 --> 00:57:12.26
What happens, I think, every now and then,

1217
00:57:12.26 --> 00:57:14.10
is you got guys to go through the whole pipeline.

1218
00:57:14.10 --> 00:57:17.42
Kerry calls is the last thing you do in training, traditionally.

1219
00:57:17.42 --> 00:57:19.18
And you could be great at all these things.

1220
00:57:19.18 --> 00:57:22.14
But if you can't get aboard, you're no good to the Navy.

1221
00:57:22.14 --> 00:57:22.66
That's right.

1222
00:57:22.66 --> 00:57:24.30
Because we land on boats.

1223
00:57:24.30 --> 00:57:24.70
And so.

1224
00:57:24.70 --> 00:57:25.20
Oh, yeah.

1225
00:57:25.20 --> 00:57:27.30
We're saying you have a P3.

1226
00:57:27.30 --> 00:57:29.34
Yeah, and fighters, exactly.

1227
00:57:29.34 --> 00:57:30.34
So is that what happens?

1228
00:57:30.34 --> 00:57:31.42
You get sent to P3s?

1229
00:57:31.42 --> 00:57:32.14
You get.

1230
00:57:32.14 --> 00:57:34.18
I mean, now you get sent to P3s.

1231
00:57:34.18 --> 00:57:36.10
You go to helicopters.

1232
00:57:36.10 --> 00:57:37.74
If you can't get aboard in a jet,

1233
00:57:37.74 --> 00:57:40.06
they're going to send you to some other non-tactical platform.

1234
00:57:40.06 --> 00:57:42.34
That's true.

1235
00:57:42.34 --> 00:57:44.62
I've been talking about this lately.

1236
00:57:44.62 --> 00:57:47.82
It seems like there are certain skill sets of people.

1237
00:57:47.82 --> 00:57:49.74
Some people just can't get through.

1238
00:57:49.74 --> 00:57:53.38
Like, for instance, when I was going through SEAL training,

1239
00:57:53.38 --> 00:57:57.62
I would say about one out of every 100 guys,

1240
00:57:57.62 --> 00:57:59.70
there's not going to be able to shoot a pistol well.

1241
00:57:59.70 --> 00:58:01.98
And they might actually not make it through the training

1242
00:58:01.98 --> 00:58:03.46
because they can't shoot a pistol.

1243
00:58:03.46 --> 00:58:04.50
They might be an athlete.

1244
00:58:04.50 --> 00:58:05.46
They might be great at everything.

1245
00:58:05.46 --> 00:58:06.06
They might be smart.

1246
00:58:06.06 --> 00:58:07.70
They can't shoot a pistol.

1247
00:58:07.70 --> 00:58:08.90
Close quarters combat.

1248
00:58:08.90 --> 00:58:10.46
There's a bunch of strict little things

1249
00:58:10.46 --> 00:58:12.14
that you have to follow.

1250
00:58:12.14 --> 00:58:14.46
And some people, I think that number is about four

1251
00:58:14.46 --> 00:58:15.98
out of every 100.

1252
00:58:15.98 --> 00:58:19.18
This is in basic SEAL training or SEAL qualification training

1253
00:58:19.18 --> 00:58:21.30
that they're just not going to get it.

1254
00:58:21.30 --> 00:58:23.94
They're just not bad people.

1255
00:58:23.94 --> 00:58:25.26
They do a lot of other things well,

1256
00:58:25.26 --> 00:58:26.62
but they just can't do that thing.

1257
00:58:26.62 --> 00:58:28.98
And it sounds like occasionally someone

1258
00:58:28.98 --> 00:58:31.34
that can fly a plane, someone that can land it on the airfield,

1259
00:58:31.34 --> 00:58:33.26
someone that can do the turns they need to do in the sky,

1260
00:58:33.26 --> 00:58:35.14
someone that understands the dynamics of it,

1261
00:58:35.14 --> 00:58:37.26
but they can't get aboard.

1262
00:58:37.26 --> 00:58:39.34
They can't land on that aircraft carrier.

1263
00:58:39.34 --> 00:58:40.38
And then it doesn't matter.

1264
00:58:40.38 --> 00:58:41.22
That's right.

1265
00:58:41.22 --> 00:58:47.06
No, it does matter because you were a top gun guy,

1266
00:58:47.06 --> 00:58:53.54
but I was an instructor at Meridian at the end of my career.

1267
00:58:53.54 --> 00:58:57.50
And I don't remember exactly how or what

1268
00:58:57.50 --> 00:58:59.14
that the guy said to me.

1269
00:58:59.14 --> 00:59:01.54
And then friendly is collegial way.

1270
00:59:01.54 --> 00:59:04.22
You know, if your students can't cut it,

1271
00:59:04.22 --> 00:59:05.46
it's not their fault.

1272
00:59:05.46 --> 00:59:07.26
It's your fault.

1273
00:59:07.26 --> 00:59:12.62
Because if this guy is not the sort of guy

1274
00:59:12.62 --> 00:59:16.70
we want for a tail hook, we'll find a place for him.

1275
00:59:16.70 --> 00:59:19.98
And he'll be valuable to the Navy.

1276
00:59:19.98 --> 00:59:21.78
So in the Air Force is the other way around.

1277
00:59:21.78 --> 00:59:25.90
It always felt to me like they were trying to get rid of you.

1278
00:59:25.90 --> 00:59:29.14
They were always rotten to you, except for one guy who

1279
00:59:29.14 --> 00:59:32.66
wound up being a, I think I put this in my list of stuff.

1280
00:59:32.66 --> 00:59:36.86
He wound up being a four-star general in NATO and Europe.

1281
00:59:36.86 --> 00:59:42.82
He maybe was personal self-esteem or self-confidence

1282
00:59:42.82 --> 00:59:43.82
or something like that.

1283
00:59:43.82 --> 00:59:45.26
He was very quiet and struck.

1284
00:59:45.26 --> 00:59:49.06
He was in T-38s and at Air Force Advanced.

1285
00:59:49.06 --> 00:59:50.30
Very laid back.

1286
00:59:50.30 --> 00:59:53.38
He'd say, Tom, come on left a little bit more.

1287
00:59:53.38 --> 00:59:55.06
Or, Tom, let me show you.

1288
00:59:55.06 --> 00:59:56.02
And he did.

1289
00:59:56.02 --> 00:59:57.18
And that was his last.

1290
00:59:57.18 --> 00:59:59.94
And they wouldn't talk to me for 10 minutes and stuff

1291
00:59:59.94 --> 01:00:00.62
like that.

1292
01:00:00.62 --> 01:00:02.46
But not because he didn't want to.

1293
01:00:02.46 --> 01:00:05.22
He'd just let you go until you made him a, no, no, no.

1294
01:00:05.22 --> 01:00:08.18
Let me show you something and stuff like that.

1295
01:00:08.18 --> 01:00:10.18
I'd say, but at any rate, they always

1296
01:00:10.18 --> 01:00:12.26
acted like they wanted to get ready or worse.

1297
01:00:12.26 --> 01:00:14.74
And the Navy, the kid doesn't make it.

1298
01:00:14.74 --> 01:00:18.66
He's been qualified by us in 16 different ways.

1299
01:00:18.66 --> 01:00:26.34
If he quits or wants to quit, it's your fault, not his.

1300
01:00:26.34 --> 01:00:30.22
And so we'll find a place for him in Helos.

1301
01:00:30.22 --> 01:00:33.94
And we have two guys there and stuff like that.

1302
01:00:33.94 --> 01:00:37.78
So where the heck were we?

1303
01:00:37.78 --> 01:00:39.22
So then you do get your orders.

1304
01:00:39.22 --> 01:00:40.86
You get your F-4 orders.

1305
01:00:40.86 --> 01:00:45.70
And I guess I kicked this whole tangent off just by the F-4

1306
01:00:45.70 --> 01:00:49.18
at the time was just like the ultimate beast.

1307
01:00:49.18 --> 01:00:50.94
The monster.

1308
01:00:50.94 --> 01:00:52.86
That's what I always called it.

1309
01:00:52.86 --> 01:00:56.58
And then I went to Mirar.

1310
01:00:56.58 --> 01:00:59.90
And I remembered this like it was yesterday.

1311
01:00:59.90 --> 01:01:02.34
Check in, do all that.

1312
01:01:02.34 --> 01:01:05.42
Going to find a place in the BOQ, forget it.

1313
01:01:05.42 --> 01:01:07.90
No chance.

1314
01:01:07.90 --> 01:01:12.38
I had to go find a place to live off base and whatnot.

1315
01:01:12.38 --> 01:01:16.86
But at any rate, VF-121 was the F-4 RAG at that time

1316
01:01:16.86 --> 01:01:21.02
and was the eastward end of the runway there.

1317
01:01:21.02 --> 01:01:26.58
And a couple of steps going through a narrow gate that

1318
01:01:26.58 --> 01:01:28.06
was always open.

1319
01:01:28.06 --> 01:01:31.86
And then F-4, you're looking at the tail,

1320
01:01:31.86 --> 01:01:33.26
up the pipes of this thing.

1321
01:01:33.26 --> 01:01:35.14
And I thought, oh my god, I forgot.

1322
01:01:35.14 --> 01:01:36.46
This is a monster.

1323
01:01:36.46 --> 01:01:37.50
I forgot.

1324
01:01:37.50 --> 01:01:39.90
And they had Marines working on them

1325
01:01:39.90 --> 01:01:42.98
because they were going to Denang or Chulai

1326
01:01:42.98 --> 01:01:49.26
to get shot full of holes and eventually abandoned over there.

1327
01:01:49.26 --> 01:01:52.98
And they took the radars out and put lead noses in them

1328
01:01:52.98 --> 01:01:53.78
at that place.

1329
01:01:53.78 --> 01:01:56.34
And basically went over the whole thing.

1330
01:01:56.34 --> 01:02:01.18
And they had Marines Mechs working on them there.

1331
01:02:01.18 --> 01:02:03.70
But I thought, oh my god, look at that thing.

1332
01:02:03.70 --> 01:02:06.26
And so that's the thing.

1333
01:02:06.26 --> 01:02:08.78
And then I walked to the end of the hangar.

1334
01:02:08.78 --> 01:02:13.18
And two F-4s taken the runway.

1335
01:02:13.18 --> 01:02:17.58
And VF-121 at that time was at that end, the east end,

1336
01:02:17.58 --> 01:02:18.30
of the runway.

1337
01:02:18.30 --> 01:02:23.18
And 99% of the time, the Mirroir took off to the west.

1338
01:02:23.18 --> 01:02:25.74
And two F-4s rolled out on the runway.

1339
01:02:25.74 --> 01:02:29.14
It was night and early morning, low coastal clouds and fog,

1340
01:02:29.14 --> 01:02:31.70
just like here.

1341
01:02:31.70 --> 01:02:32.98
This is at Miramar.

1342
01:02:32.98 --> 01:02:37.22
And they ran up.

1343
01:02:37.22 --> 01:02:38.90
And then they rolled.

1344
01:02:38.90 --> 01:02:40.30
And they firewalled.

1345
01:02:40.30 --> 01:02:42.58
And they went to Burner.

1346
01:02:42.58 --> 01:02:45.02
And then they disappeared into the mist.

1347
01:02:45.02 --> 01:02:50.02
I thought, oh my god, I am in over my head.

1348
01:02:50.02 --> 01:02:51.66
But you learn to do it.

1349
01:02:51.66 --> 01:02:53.18
And get good at it.

1350
01:02:53.18 --> 01:02:55.22
I got pretty good at it.

1351
01:02:55.22 --> 01:02:59.06
Although, you know, there's a thing about LSOs,

1352
01:02:59.06 --> 01:03:00.98
since you're here.

1353
01:03:00.98 --> 01:03:03.94
So the LSO is the grader, basically?

1354
01:03:03.94 --> 01:03:05.14
That's the landing signal officer.

1355
01:03:05.14 --> 01:03:06.70
You grade every landing.

1356
01:03:06.70 --> 01:03:07.70
That's right.

1357
01:03:07.70 --> 01:03:08.26
OK.

1358
01:03:08.26 --> 01:03:13.06
And you have to call Meepo on state for every landing,

1359
01:03:13.06 --> 01:03:15.14
VFR, IFR, anything else.

1360
01:03:15.14 --> 01:03:19.50
And he's the guy when you look up and they say,

1361
01:03:19.50 --> 01:03:25.26
one peak is worth 10,000 scans, scanning your panel,

1362
01:03:25.26 --> 01:03:28.78
instrument flying is something that's hard to understand

1363
01:03:28.78 --> 01:03:30.98
if you haven't done it.

1364
01:03:30.98 --> 01:03:33.18
You cannot make a mistake or you're

1365
01:03:33.18 --> 01:03:35.46
going to be killed and wreck the airplane.

1366
01:03:35.46 --> 01:03:39.98
No mistakes allowed in genuine IFR,

1367
01:03:39.98 --> 01:03:42.46
and especially carrier IFR.

1368
01:03:42.46 --> 01:03:49.06
But he's the guy who says to you, you say, 2400 Clara.

1369
01:03:49.06 --> 01:03:52.30
And he says to you, that means I don't see the Meepo.

1370
01:03:52.30 --> 01:03:54.70
And really, you can't see the deck either.

1371
01:03:54.70 --> 01:03:58.18
And he says to you, you're looking great, babe.

1372
01:03:58.18 --> 01:03:59.90
Keep it coming.

1373
01:03:59.90 --> 01:04:02.18
And you just have to trust what he's saying.

1374
01:04:02.18 --> 01:04:05.06
Because you can't see visually because of fog or whatever?

1375
01:04:05.06 --> 01:04:07.86
Well, one second later, or maybe a half second later,

1376
01:04:07.86 --> 01:04:11.26
you see the deck and then you're aboard.

1377
01:04:11.26 --> 01:04:14.62
He'll say that to you at a half mile.

1378
01:04:14.62 --> 01:04:17.58
The radar controller says, half mile, call a ball

1379
01:04:17.58 --> 01:04:19.58
or execute a wave off.

1380
01:04:19.58 --> 01:04:23.30
And you take a second peak and nothing there.

1381
01:04:23.30 --> 01:04:27.26
You see a white glow from the deck.

1382
01:04:27.26 --> 01:04:30.70
But if you're on centerline and on glide slope,

1383
01:04:30.70 --> 01:04:31.66
you're going to be OK.

1384
01:04:31.66 --> 01:04:33.62
And he's tracking that via radar?

1385
01:04:33.62 --> 01:04:36.50
Or he's because he can't see you either, right?

1386
01:04:36.50 --> 01:04:37.26
Yeah.

1387
01:04:37.26 --> 01:04:37.98
The ship does.

1388
01:04:37.98 --> 01:04:39.34
It's different now, I think.

1389
01:04:39.34 --> 01:04:41.46
But it's essentially sort of the same.

1390
01:04:41.46 --> 01:04:45.18
You have an IFR had a radar reflector on the nose gear.

1391
01:04:45.18 --> 01:04:48.58
And the ship's track while scan radar

1392
01:04:48.58 --> 01:04:50.74
would lock on to that receiver.

1393
01:04:50.74 --> 01:04:53.46
Otherwise, it might lock on to the wing tip.

1394
01:04:53.46 --> 01:05:00.30
And that will keep you on if you're flying accurately.

1395
01:05:00.30 --> 01:05:02.34
Everything will be when you break out.

1396
01:05:02.34 --> 01:05:06.26
You'll be on centerline on glide slope at the center of Neapol.

1397
01:05:06.26 --> 01:05:13.38
And basically, with a fuel in black oil ship,

1398
01:05:13.38 --> 01:05:16.46
Constellation was America before.

1399
01:05:16.46 --> 01:05:19.94
They were both black oil ships.

1400
01:05:19.94 --> 01:05:22.18
They have a stack gas problem.

1401
01:05:22.18 --> 01:05:25.30
But actually, with a nuclear powered carrier,

1402
01:05:25.30 --> 01:05:26.98
you have the bubble that comes around,

1403
01:05:26.98 --> 01:05:29.62
the wind coming around the island.

1404
01:05:29.62 --> 01:05:31.54
I'm told you can feel that too.

1405
01:05:31.54 --> 01:05:37.34
But with a fossil powered ship, you had a lot of bubble.

1406
01:05:37.34 --> 01:05:39.78
So you're hitting turbulence based on the rise of coming

1407
01:05:39.78 --> 01:05:40.14
to land.

1408
01:05:40.14 --> 01:05:41.34
Right there.

1409
01:05:41.34 --> 01:05:43.98
A tenth of a mile from touchdown.

1410
01:05:43.98 --> 01:05:44.98
Yeah.

1411
01:05:44.98 --> 01:05:47.46
One time, I had my mask loose.

1412
01:05:47.46 --> 01:05:50.26
You could smell it.

1413
01:05:50.26 --> 01:05:51.54
My mask wasn't tight enough.

1414
01:05:51.54 --> 01:05:51.94
What was it?

1415
01:05:51.94 --> 01:05:53.90
Do you remember your first carrier landing?

1416
01:05:53.90 --> 01:05:55.18
Yeah, I do.

1417
01:05:55.18 --> 01:05:57.34
How'd it go?

1418
01:05:57.34 --> 01:05:59.06
I thought that was pretty great.

1419
01:05:59.06 --> 01:05:59.98
That's all I remember.

1420
01:05:59.98 --> 01:06:02.66
I remember being on the catapult, though.

1421
01:06:02.66 --> 01:06:06.30
It was a Randolph with hydraulic cats.

1422
01:06:06.30 --> 01:06:09.26
It was one of the only ships left with hydraulic cats.

1423
01:06:09.26 --> 01:06:10.90
They'd all been converted to steam

1424
01:06:10.90 --> 01:06:13.78
when they put the angled deck on them.

1425
01:06:13.78 --> 01:06:17.86
These old Essex and Yorktown class ships,

1426
01:06:17.86 --> 01:06:19.62
they put steam catapults in them.

1427
01:06:19.62 --> 01:06:21.94
But some of them, they put hydraulic cats.

1428
01:06:21.94 --> 01:06:26.46
And Randolph was still a wonderful, clean, well run ship.

1429
01:06:26.46 --> 01:06:27.94
I thought a little.

1430
01:06:27.94 --> 01:06:29.74
I know the captain was very friendly to me,

1431
01:06:29.74 --> 01:06:31.22
because I was an oddball.

1432
01:06:31.22 --> 01:06:34.30
I was coming across Air Force Officer.

1433
01:06:34.30 --> 01:06:37.42
He had been told, come on up on the bridge.

1434
01:06:37.42 --> 01:06:38.74
It was very nice.

1435
01:06:38.74 --> 01:06:42.58
At any rate, sitting there, getting

1436
01:06:42.58 --> 01:06:45.86
ready to get on the hydraulic cats on Randolph,

1437
01:06:45.86 --> 01:06:50.98
I remember thinking to myself, I don't have to be doing this.

1438
01:06:50.98 --> 01:06:55.34
I remember thinking, if I say, I don't want to do this,

1439
01:06:55.34 --> 01:06:57.78
they'll stop right now.

1440
01:06:57.78 --> 01:06:59.94
I must be crazy.

1441
01:06:59.94 --> 01:07:00.58
I did it.

1442
01:07:00.58 --> 01:07:01.86
Boom.

1443
01:07:01.86 --> 01:07:02.26
But.

1444
01:07:02.26 --> 01:07:03.86
Without your first cat launch?

1445
01:07:03.86 --> 01:07:04.94
Yeah.

1446
01:07:04.94 --> 01:07:07.42
And they told you over and over again,

1447
01:07:07.42 --> 01:07:09.82
these are hydraulic cats.

1448
01:07:09.82 --> 01:07:13.82
Bob said, you're a pal and instructor.

1449
01:07:13.82 --> 01:07:17.66
He said, now, make sure you're all the way back.

1450
01:07:17.66 --> 01:07:20.42
Make sure you've got your elbow locked,

1451
01:07:20.42 --> 01:07:23.58
because it's a hell of a bang.

1452
01:07:23.58 --> 01:07:27.70
And you get, on your first 15, 20 feet,

1453
01:07:27.70 --> 01:07:30.98
you get 80% of your acceleration right up front.

1454
01:07:30.98 --> 01:07:33.18
And then you're sort of just trundled down

1455
01:07:33.18 --> 01:07:35.10
the rest of the way.

1456
01:07:35.10 --> 01:07:36.14
So I was ready.

1457
01:07:36.14 --> 01:07:39.42
But all the way back in the seat, head back,

1458
01:07:39.42 --> 01:07:43.30
and elbow locked, I didn't think about my knees.

1459
01:07:43.30 --> 01:07:48.42
When that thing went off, my knees were up here somewhere.

1460
01:07:48.42 --> 01:07:51.90
But the F9, I think the FAA team is the same way.

1461
01:07:51.90 --> 01:07:57.34
You can take the shot, hands off, and then grab the stick

1462
01:07:57.34 --> 01:08:00.46
as soon as you're out over the water.

1463
01:08:00.46 --> 01:08:03.02
So I still had my hand on the pole,

1464
01:08:03.02 --> 01:08:05.82
but I had to get my knees back down.

1465
01:08:05.82 --> 01:08:09.26
So is the hydraulic harder to launch than the steam,

1466
01:08:09.26 --> 01:08:11.22
because the steam is more gradual buildup or something?

1467
01:08:11.22 --> 01:08:12.90
Yeah, the steam is smoother.

1468
01:08:12.90 --> 01:08:15.70
And it's a continuous flow.

1469
01:08:15.70 --> 01:08:19.78
And I guess the new electric cats are that way as well.

1470
01:08:19.78 --> 01:08:21.38
It's supposed to be even better, I guess.

1471
01:08:21.38 --> 01:08:24.86
I don't know how there would be, but I guess there would be.

1472
01:08:24.86 --> 01:08:27.74
Now, this is the time like Dan Peterson,

1473
01:08:27.74 --> 01:08:31.62
you guys are working almost getting in this air to air

1474
01:08:31.62 --> 01:08:35.18
combat, where you're training at a level that really you

1475
01:08:35.18 --> 01:08:36.14
hadn't trained before.

1476
01:08:36.14 --> 01:08:38.90
Or the pilots hadn't been training this way.

1477
01:08:38.90 --> 01:08:43.30
We're going hard against each other all the time.

1478
01:08:43.30 --> 01:08:44.34
Yes and no.

1479
01:08:44.34 --> 01:08:48.78
In that, that was the beginning of the,

1480
01:08:48.78 --> 01:08:52.22
I said in my talking to Dave via email,

1481
01:08:52.22 --> 01:08:55.42
I said my only claim to fame here, being unusual,

1482
01:08:55.42 --> 01:08:58.10
if you will, is the fact that I was there

1483
01:08:58.10 --> 01:09:01.62
when what became Top Gun started.

1484
01:09:01.62 --> 01:09:02.62
I was there.

1485
01:09:02.62 --> 01:09:06.14
Sam Leeds, who's in Dan Peterson's book,

1486
01:09:06.14 --> 01:09:07.98
came into various ready rooms.

1487
01:09:07.98 --> 01:09:10.42
And VF-121 had about three or four of them,

1488
01:09:10.42 --> 01:09:13.46
I can't even remember because they took the whole hanger.

1489
01:09:13.46 --> 01:09:15.46
And they came in there and said, we're going to do that.

1490
01:09:15.46 --> 01:09:17.90
Oh, a lot of F-4s.

1491
01:09:17.90 --> 01:09:23.22
And some F-8s too, were getting shot down by MiG-17s mostly.

1492
01:09:23.22 --> 01:09:27.54
But RA-5Cs were getting shot down by MiG-21s

1493
01:09:27.54 --> 01:09:30.66
because they were MiG-21.

1494
01:09:30.66 --> 01:09:34.54
RA-5C would be cruising at, say, 600 knots, taking pictures,

1495
01:09:34.54 --> 01:09:37.06
or going to his next spot to take pictures.

1496
01:09:37.06 --> 01:09:42.10
And the MiG-21 would come downhill from 30, 35,000

1497
01:09:42.10 --> 01:09:46.26
at 1.2, 1.4, something like that.

1498
01:09:46.26 --> 01:09:51.62
And launch Soviet, what was the B model,

1499
01:09:51.62 --> 01:09:55.38
they had stolen from us, a sidewinder,

1500
01:09:55.38 --> 01:09:57.58
and shoot down the RA-5C.

1501
01:09:57.58 --> 01:09:58.58
That was the big deal.

1502
01:09:58.58 --> 01:10:01.86
Don't let your RA-5C, if you're the escort,

1503
01:10:01.86 --> 01:10:05.46
and I was lots of times, if you're the escort of the RA-5C,

1504
01:10:05.46 --> 01:10:09.14
don't let him get, you have to keep looking back and up there

1505
01:10:09.14 --> 01:10:13.94
and be prepared to turn into him for a head-on with a sparrow.

1506
01:10:13.94 --> 01:10:16.98
But at any rate, what was the question?

1507
01:10:16.98 --> 01:10:20.50
Well, I'm just trying to gather that eventually what I want

1508
01:10:20.50 --> 01:10:23.34
to know is how well prepared you were when you went

1509
01:10:23.34 --> 01:10:27.14
on deployment from a pilot.

1510
01:10:27.14 --> 01:10:29.18
So I was in the SEAL teams.

1511
01:10:29.18 --> 01:10:32.22
We would shoot so many rounds through our guns.

1512
01:10:32.22 --> 01:10:34.30
We would do so many immediate action drills.

1513
01:10:34.30 --> 01:10:39.62
We would do so many drills and so much training

1514
01:10:39.62 --> 01:10:42.90
that by the time we went overseas, I felt really good.

1515
01:10:42.90 --> 01:10:44.54
I felt really good.

1516
01:10:44.54 --> 01:10:49.18
And I'm trying to figure out where you guys would feel

1517
01:10:49.18 --> 01:10:52.98
the first time you get on your first combat mission.

1518
01:10:52.98 --> 01:10:55.66
Well, there's nothing quite like getting shot at the first time.

1519
01:10:55.66 --> 01:10:57.22
You do remember that.

1520
01:10:57.22 --> 01:11:00.90
But I remember the time they had some sort of an exercise

1521
01:11:00.90 --> 01:11:02.98
where we flew down the coast and back up again

1522
01:11:02.98 --> 01:11:07.74
and maybe went up as high as Hanoi and or more

1523
01:11:07.74 --> 01:11:11.54
the seaport that the Haifong went at the mouth of the river

1524
01:11:11.54 --> 01:11:16.22
up there and back and got aboard and came aboard.

1525
01:11:16.22 --> 01:11:16.90
Big exercise.

1526
01:11:16.90 --> 01:11:21.14
I remember looking out over northern part of South Vietnam

1527
01:11:21.14 --> 01:11:23.74
and over into Laos and all that red.

1528
01:11:23.74 --> 01:11:26.98
I thought, holy smoke, that's for real.

1529
01:11:26.98 --> 01:11:29.02
It's only every one and every six.

1530
01:11:29.02 --> 01:11:31.14
But you're not quite ready for that.

1531
01:11:31.14 --> 01:11:33.74
And the first time you actually see it going by,

1532
01:11:33.74 --> 01:11:37.26
it makes you an older man immediately, I think.

1533
01:11:37.26 --> 01:11:40.22
So wherever we are.

1534
01:11:40.22 --> 01:11:43.06
So you're training to get ready to get over there?

1535
01:11:43.06 --> 01:11:44.74
There's no way you're dog fighting?

1536
01:11:44.74 --> 01:11:45.22
Are you?

1537
01:11:45.22 --> 01:11:46.14
Oh, yeah.

1538
01:11:46.14 --> 01:11:46.98
Oh, yes.

1539
01:11:46.98 --> 01:11:48.18
Yeah, one on ones.

1540
01:11:48.18 --> 01:11:50.02
That's what you did in your training.

1541
01:11:50.02 --> 01:11:53.54
You left Miramar and went out over the water.

1542
01:11:53.54 --> 01:11:58.18
And the standard deal was your flight leader,

1543
01:11:58.18 --> 01:11:59.34
you're the wingman.

1544
01:11:59.34 --> 01:12:00.50
He kisses you off.

1545
01:12:00.50 --> 01:12:03.54
You both turn 30 degrees away and you

1546
01:12:03.54 --> 01:12:05.98
proceed until one guy turns in.

1547
01:12:05.98 --> 01:12:08.90
You can turn in immediately or you can wait.

1548
01:12:08.90 --> 01:12:11.94
If you're the younger guy, you wait until the older guy

1549
01:12:11.94 --> 01:12:14.78
finally turns in because he can't see you anymore.

1550
01:12:14.78 --> 01:12:19.14
You can barely see him and you know his eyeballs.

1551
01:12:19.14 --> 01:12:20.58
Not as good as yours.

1552
01:12:20.58 --> 01:12:22.58
But you turn in and make a head on it.

1553
01:12:22.58 --> 01:12:24.74
And then you can see his wings flash.

1554
01:12:24.74 --> 01:12:28.70
And he sees your wings flash and make a head on pass.

1555
01:12:28.70 --> 01:12:30.98
But that's not the way it is in combat.

1556
01:12:30.98 --> 01:12:35.74
When you get into a combat situation, well, statistically,

1557
01:12:35.74 --> 01:12:39.34
it doesn't matter whether it's World War I, Korea,

1558
01:12:39.34 --> 01:12:41.70
or the Vietnam War.

1559
01:12:41.70 --> 01:12:45.50
The guys who got shot down, the guys who didn't see it coming,

1560
01:12:45.50 --> 01:12:49.38
it's like 99% of them.

1561
01:12:49.38 --> 01:12:51.86
One guy got shot down, let's say.

1562
01:12:51.86 --> 01:12:55.02
He said, yeah, he got it on me and he pulled inside

1563
01:12:55.02 --> 01:12:57.06
and he unloaded and he got me.

1564
01:12:57.06 --> 01:12:58.62
But that's the exception.

1565
01:12:58.62 --> 01:13:01.74
And more over 95% of the airplane shot

1566
01:13:01.74 --> 01:13:09.34
then I popped a pee there in Vietnam with AAA,

1567
01:13:09.34 --> 01:13:10.82
not with SAMs.

1568
01:13:10.82 --> 01:13:12.98
Everybody knows SAMs this and SAMs that.

1569
01:13:12.98 --> 01:13:16.46
But no, when you're vulnerable and relatively close

1570
01:13:16.46 --> 01:13:20.10
to the ground, that's when they got you,

1571
01:13:20.10 --> 01:13:22.06
especially when you could see it going by you

1572
01:13:22.06 --> 01:13:24.22
or in the envelope if you will.

1573
01:13:24.22 --> 01:13:26.70
And that's just a matter of chance in a way.

1574
01:13:26.70 --> 01:13:27.30
That's right.

1575
01:13:27.30 --> 01:13:30.10
Well, better tactics.

1576
01:13:30.10 --> 01:13:33.54
There are better tactics and poorer tactics.

1577
01:13:33.54 --> 01:13:38.82
And I think I wrote in, is that my monograph there?

1578
01:13:38.82 --> 01:13:43.26
Guy said to me way back, in Kingsville,

1579
01:13:43.26 --> 01:13:47.38
I teach you to let it roll off on a wing, let the nose fall,

1580
01:13:47.38 --> 01:13:50.86
acquire the target, adjust a little bit,

1581
01:13:50.86 --> 01:13:55.26
and now you're watching the altimeter and so forth.

1582
01:13:55.26 --> 01:13:56.62
I said, this is baloney.

1583
01:13:56.62 --> 01:13:57.90
I want to hit the target.

1584
01:13:57.90 --> 01:14:00.98
I want to put them right in the hole there.

1585
01:14:00.98 --> 01:14:04.58
Pull down, up, invert, pull down.

1586
01:14:04.58 --> 01:14:06.86
Some ROs think you're crazy the first time

1587
01:14:06.86 --> 01:14:08.86
they're in the back when you do this.

1588
01:14:08.86 --> 01:14:12.02
Pull down as steep as possible.

1589
01:14:12.02 --> 01:14:15.06
Well, more than 30 degrees, you betcha.

1590
01:14:15.06 --> 01:14:18.14
How about 60 or 70 degrees?

1591
01:14:18.14 --> 01:14:22.34
The steeper you are, the safer you are, the faster you are,

1592
01:14:22.34 --> 01:14:23.66
the better you are.

1593
01:14:23.66 --> 01:14:25.26
And then I think I wrote in here.

1594
01:14:25.26 --> 01:14:29.42
Is there any compromise when you go to come out of that dive

1595
01:14:29.42 --> 01:14:32.34
and turn the airplane back up towards the sky?

1596
01:14:32.34 --> 01:14:36.90
Not really, because they've been through all that at Pax River.

1597
01:14:36.90 --> 01:14:42.58
Say the flight test in the book, the manual that you have,

1598
01:14:42.58 --> 01:14:47.94
the NATOPS manual, the flight manual for pilots,

1599
01:14:47.94 --> 01:14:50.94
or the tactics manual has all these tables in there.

1600
01:14:50.94 --> 01:14:54.94
And you can say, if I get out and let's say,

1601
01:14:54.94 --> 01:15:01.54
I have 80 degrees angle of dive and I get out at 6,000 feet,

1602
01:15:01.54 --> 01:15:03.46
I'll still be well clear.

1603
01:15:03.46 --> 01:15:08.82
I have 1,500 feet of to clear if I pull 6 and 1 half Gs

1604
01:15:08.82 --> 01:15:09.42
to get out.

1605
01:15:09.42 --> 01:15:12.14
If I pull 7, I'm even better off.

1606
01:15:12.14 --> 01:15:14.90
But you lose power when you do that.

1607
01:15:14.90 --> 01:15:17.70
I'm sorry, you lose airspeed when you do that.

1608
01:15:17.70 --> 01:15:20.74
So you pull the Gs, you're safe.

1609
01:15:20.74 --> 01:15:22.78
A lot of guys would not do that, though.

1610
01:15:22.78 --> 01:15:25.86
But did you train this way before going to Vietnam?

1611
01:15:25.86 --> 01:15:29.62
Did you know that the high angle attack was better?

1612
01:15:29.62 --> 01:15:31.06
No.

1613
01:15:31.06 --> 01:15:33.06
Were you figured out when you got there?

1614
01:15:33.06 --> 01:15:37.06
No, I figured it out in Arizona, going over there

1615
01:15:37.06 --> 01:15:40.18
to those targets that they have.

1616
01:15:40.18 --> 01:15:42.86
I guess in the East Coast, they have them all over the place,

1617
01:15:42.86 --> 01:15:44.30
too, in rural places.

1618
01:15:44.30 --> 01:15:49.50
It's a huge, plowed area, and plowed in a circle.

1619
01:15:49.50 --> 01:15:53.02
And they have two towers, wooden towers,

1620
01:15:53.02 --> 01:15:56.14
and 12 o'clock at 3 o'clock.

1621
01:15:56.14 --> 01:15:58.50
And they talk to each other.

1622
01:15:58.50 --> 01:16:01.86
And they tell you where your hit was on there.

1623
01:16:01.86 --> 01:16:04.94
And a white thing in the center.

1624
01:16:04.94 --> 01:16:07.38
And they tell you, you bomb.

1625
01:16:07.38 --> 01:16:12.74
But a guy told me, if you want to be safe, be steeper, be faster.

1626
01:16:12.74 --> 01:16:14.18
I said, that's for me.

1627
01:16:14.18 --> 01:16:17.94
And then I saw this picture, sort of famous.

1628
01:16:17.94 --> 01:16:21.30
And you've probably seen it of an airplane diving

1629
01:16:21.30 --> 01:16:25.82
on a Japanese aircraft carrier at midway.

1630
01:16:25.82 --> 01:16:28.98
And the guy is 89 degrees.

1631
01:16:28.98 --> 01:16:29.98
That is for me.

1632
01:16:29.98 --> 01:16:31.26
That's why I'm going to do it.

1633
01:16:31.26 --> 01:16:33.14
So roll inverted, pull into your nose down.

1634
01:16:33.14 --> 01:16:34.62
Then you get your dive right there.

1635
01:16:34.62 --> 01:16:37.34
Because your nose wants to come up the faster you go.

1636
01:16:37.34 --> 01:16:41.90
And an airplane, whether it's a Piper Cub or an F-4 or F-18,

1637
01:16:41.90 --> 01:16:46.02
your nose wants to rise as you build air.

1638
01:16:46.02 --> 01:16:48.06
Airspeed is just aerodynamics.

1639
01:16:48.06 --> 01:16:50.58
So get the nose down there right now.

1640
01:16:50.58 --> 01:16:52.58
And then you can do whatever you want.

1641
01:16:52.58 --> 01:16:56.58
F-4, you could pull a powered idle at 500.

1642
01:16:56.58 --> 01:16:57.82
And it would hold five.

1643
01:16:57.82 --> 01:17:00.06
I don't know what they do in F-18s.

1644
01:17:00.06 --> 01:17:02.58
But then anyway, pull a powered idle at 500,

1645
01:17:02.58 --> 01:17:06.54
almost no matter what your dive angle was.

1646
01:17:06.54 --> 01:17:09.18
What does that mean, pull powered idle at 500?

1647
01:17:09.18 --> 01:17:10.18
What does that mean?

1648
01:17:10.18 --> 01:17:13.22
Just pull the throttles all the way back to idle.

1649
01:17:13.22 --> 01:17:15.54
And it would hold 500 knots.

1650
01:17:15.54 --> 01:17:16.02
Got it.

1651
01:17:16.02 --> 01:17:18.58
So you wouldn't increase your speed to some.

1652
01:17:18.58 --> 01:17:18.94
Right.

1653
01:17:18.94 --> 01:17:20.62
I don't know why.

1654
01:17:20.62 --> 01:17:23.22
It's just they discovered it, no doubt,

1655
01:17:23.22 --> 01:17:26.30
after they were actually flying the airplane.

1656
01:17:26.30 --> 01:17:29.74
But if you go 550, it'll hold that.

1657
01:17:29.74 --> 01:17:32.22
So a lot of guys would say 500 is fast enough for me.

1658
01:17:32.22 --> 01:17:33.54
I've got to pull out of this.

1659
01:17:33.54 --> 01:17:35.22
But I said, Blaney, look on the charts.

1660
01:17:35.22 --> 01:17:36.82
You can get out easy.

1661
01:17:36.82 --> 01:17:37.94
They wouldn't do it.

1662
01:17:37.94 --> 01:17:39.86
But I said, steeper is better.

1663
01:17:39.86 --> 01:17:41.74
So I was surprised.

1664
01:17:41.74 --> 01:17:45.10
The guy in the back says, you know, we were 560 knots tonight.

1665
01:17:45.10 --> 01:17:46.98
Yeah, fine.

1666
01:17:46.98 --> 01:17:48.94
Like that.

1667
01:17:48.94 --> 01:17:50.78
I never got any holes.

1668
01:17:50.78 --> 01:17:52.54
I got scared a couple of times.

1669
01:17:52.54 --> 01:17:54.02
Well, yeah.

1670
01:17:54.02 --> 01:17:55.10
Got warned.

1671
01:17:55.10 --> 01:18:01.50
I had a load go off right there that gave me,

1672
01:18:01.50 --> 01:18:04.58
you know, a picture taken with an old style flash bulb.

1673
01:18:04.58 --> 01:18:07.62
It gave me spots in front of my eyes.

1674
01:18:07.62 --> 01:18:10.58
It was that close, but no holes.

1675
01:18:10.58 --> 01:18:12.54
I never did.

1676
01:18:12.54 --> 01:18:17.62
And the guys who came back with a hole about as big as a 45

1677
01:18:17.62 --> 01:18:22.30
caliber bullet in the bottom of the airplane, but not me.

1678
01:18:22.30 --> 01:18:30.26
We had leadership in the squadron I was in that I kept going back

1679
01:18:30.26 --> 01:18:34.66
to reading your book about how this guy, Ruel Gardner,

1680
01:18:34.66 --> 01:18:35.98
the way he operated.

1681
01:18:35.98 --> 01:18:37.98
And he was a former underwater demolition team guy.

1682
01:18:37.98 --> 01:18:38.98
Right.

1683
01:18:38.98 --> 01:18:42.02
And so how did he operate?

1684
01:18:42.02 --> 01:18:45.94
He was very laid back, very quiet about everything.

1685
01:18:45.94 --> 01:18:51.02
And we get after him about sharks, for instance.

1686
01:18:51.02 --> 01:18:54.22
And he said, nah, he says sharks don't bother you.

1687
01:18:54.22 --> 01:18:56.86
But barracudas sometimes do.

1688
01:18:56.86 --> 01:18:58.18
They're curious.

1689
01:18:58.18 --> 01:19:00.58
And they'll come right up to you and wonder what the heck you're

1690
01:19:00.58 --> 01:19:02.78
doing and what you are.

1691
01:19:02.78 --> 01:19:04.02
I didn't get it right.

1692
01:19:04.02 --> 01:19:05.54
That sort of thing.

1693
01:19:05.54 --> 01:19:10.94
And he was the guy who would do the classic Navy routine, if

1694
01:19:10.94 --> 01:19:11.54
you will.

1695
01:19:11.54 --> 01:19:13.70
Tom, can you help me with this?

1696
01:19:13.70 --> 01:19:16.10
As opposed to Tom, get that done.

1697
01:19:16.10 --> 01:19:20.70
Rather, can you help me with this?

1698
01:19:20.70 --> 01:19:24.02
It's funny in leadership terms.

1699
01:19:24.02 --> 01:19:27.66
If you say to a guy, can you help me with this?

1700
01:19:27.66 --> 01:19:31.58
He may not really want to do it.

1701
01:19:31.58 --> 01:19:35.94
But the way you phrase it makes you want to help him.

1702
01:19:35.94 --> 01:19:40.10
If he says, do that or else and you don't want to do it,

1703
01:19:40.10 --> 01:19:41.54
this is you all.

1704
01:19:41.54 --> 01:19:42.54
100%.

1705
01:19:42.54 --> 01:19:44.98
You know?

1706
01:19:44.98 --> 01:19:47.70
It's your style.

1707
01:19:47.70 --> 01:19:51.58
But it's effective in leadership terms.

1708
01:19:51.58 --> 01:19:56.94
Very effective to use the old Navy way of doing things like

1709
01:19:56.94 --> 01:19:57.18
that.

1710
01:19:57.18 --> 01:20:01.30
I don't know how the Marine Corps operates, but I had a pal who

1711
01:20:01.30 --> 01:20:06.90
got killed in Vietnam who's told me I will be a Marine general.

1712
01:20:06.90 --> 01:20:11.98
He got killed being aggressive, I think, based upon what I heard

1713
01:20:11.98 --> 01:20:13.78
about what happened with him.

1714
01:20:13.78 --> 01:20:22.18
But to that end, I just wondered how the Marine Corps operates

1715
01:20:22.18 --> 01:20:24.62
when the guy doesn't want to really do that.

1716
01:20:24.62 --> 01:20:29.22
But he would if you had just asked him as opposed to saying to

1717
01:20:29.22 --> 01:20:30.38
it or else.

1718
01:20:30.38 --> 01:20:34.18
Well, having worked with all kinds of leaders in the Army,

1719
01:20:34.18 --> 01:20:37.50
Navy, Air Force, and Marines, the good leaders in all those

1720
01:20:37.50 --> 01:20:40.42
organizations are the type that say, hey, I need some help with

1721
01:20:40.42 --> 01:20:40.58
this.

1722
01:20:40.58 --> 01:20:41.42
Hey, what do you think?

1723
01:20:41.42 --> 01:20:42.78
How do you think we should bet?

1724
01:20:42.78 --> 01:20:43.74
I think that's the stuff.

1725
01:20:43.74 --> 01:20:46.58
And across the board, and then you take this into the civilian

1726
01:20:46.58 --> 01:20:50.02
sector as well, the ones that Barch orders and yell at people

1727
01:20:50.02 --> 01:20:52.50
and say, you need to do this right now because I'm ordering you

1728
01:20:52.50 --> 01:20:53.02
to do it.

1729
01:20:53.02 --> 01:20:56.94
They're not ever considered to be good leaders.

1730
01:20:56.94 --> 01:21:00.10
But that's by and large the Air Force style.

1731
01:21:00.10 --> 01:21:01.66
No exaggeration.

1732
01:21:01.66 --> 01:21:05.50
Maybe my experience in the Air Force wasn't broad enough.

1733
01:21:05.50 --> 01:21:08.14
But by and large, that's what they do there.

1734
01:21:08.14 --> 01:21:09.26
What, Barch orders?

1735
01:21:09.26 --> 01:21:09.74
Yeah.

1736
01:21:09.74 --> 01:21:11.66
Yeah, that's unfortunate.

1737
01:21:11.66 --> 01:21:15.46
Maybe the order, having read his autobiography,

1738
01:21:15.46 --> 01:21:17.74
he didn't write it himself really, really.

1739
01:21:17.74 --> 01:21:21.58
But Ferris LeMay talking about the way

1740
01:21:21.58 --> 01:21:26.10
he operated in England in World War II, do it or else.

1741
01:21:26.10 --> 01:21:28.14
Wait a minute.

1742
01:21:28.14 --> 01:21:32.62
Yeah, well, there's a whole thing to talk about there.

1743
01:21:32.62 --> 01:21:35.06
There's this idea of the authoritarian people.

1744
01:21:35.06 --> 01:21:37.90
Certain people have an authoritarian mindset.

1745
01:21:37.90 --> 01:21:40.46
They're attracted to the authoritarian mindset.

1746
01:21:40.46 --> 01:21:42.70
And when they look at the military, when they're

1747
01:21:42.70 --> 01:21:45.34
10 years old or 17 years old or 20 years old,

1748
01:21:45.34 --> 01:21:46.78
they look at the military.

1749
01:21:46.78 --> 01:21:49.02
And they're very excited about it because they think, oh,

1750
01:21:49.02 --> 01:21:53.18
there's a place where if I have rank,

1751
01:21:53.18 --> 01:21:54.74
people have to respect me.

1752
01:21:54.74 --> 01:21:56.02
They have to listen to me.

1753
01:21:56.02 --> 01:21:59.86
And so the military actually attracts these type of people.

1754
01:21:59.86 --> 01:22:06.54
And most of the time, they kind of become not the best leaders.

1755
01:22:06.54 --> 01:22:09.10
And they usually don't make it very far because they

1756
01:22:09.10 --> 01:22:11.18
piss people off and whatever.

1757
01:22:11.18 --> 01:22:13.22
Occasionally, you'll have someone that

1758
01:22:13.22 --> 01:22:14.58
gets put in the right circumstances.

1759
01:22:14.58 --> 01:22:17.18
And despite the fact that they're a tyrannical leader,

1760
01:22:17.18 --> 01:22:18.54
they're still able to advance.

1761
01:22:18.54 --> 01:22:21.66
And Curtis LeMay is probably a good example of that.

1762
01:22:21.66 --> 01:22:24.94
Here he was in charge of bombing Europe.

1763
01:22:24.94 --> 01:22:26.02
And he puts together a plan.

1764
01:22:26.02 --> 01:22:27.94
It's like, hey, this is what we're doing.

1765
01:22:27.94 --> 01:22:30.18
And it was an extreme situation.

1766
01:22:30.18 --> 01:22:31.14
And it ended up working.

1767
01:22:31.14 --> 01:22:33.22
And then he gets his.

1768
01:22:33.22 --> 01:22:34.50
They made him a hero.

1769
01:22:34.50 --> 01:22:37.74
But in his autobiography, he says that I had no choice

1770
01:22:37.74 --> 01:22:41.78
but to begin to ascertain that we had to do it that way

1771
01:22:41.78 --> 01:22:44.98
or else we wouldn't do it at all.

1772
01:22:44.98 --> 01:22:46.34
So it can happen.

1773
01:22:46.34 --> 01:22:49.02
But like I said, I've worked with Air Force.

1774
01:22:49.02 --> 01:22:49.82
I've worked with Navy.

1775
01:22:49.82 --> 01:22:51.06
I've worked with the Marine Corps.

1776
01:22:51.06 --> 01:22:52.46
I've worked with the Navy.

1777
01:22:52.46 --> 01:22:56.26
And the good leaders and all of them are not tyrannical at all.

1778
01:22:56.26 --> 01:22:58.42
Now, are there situations that you can get into?

1779
01:22:58.42 --> 01:22:59.74
Or it's like, hey, we got it.

1780
01:22:59.74 --> 01:23:00.86
This is what we're doing.

1781
01:23:00.86 --> 01:23:03.38
Occasionally, that happens.

1782
01:23:03.38 --> 01:23:05.74
But it doesn't really happen a lot.

1783
01:23:05.74 --> 01:23:07.42
And yeah.

1784
01:23:07.42 --> 01:23:11.54
Now, I'm also thinking with your old job in the Air Force,

1785
01:23:11.54 --> 01:23:15.94
where you've got there's no room for any error

1786
01:23:15.94 --> 01:23:17.98
because you're dealing with nuclear weapons,

1787
01:23:17.98 --> 01:23:24.14
that probably emphasized that type of leadership more

1788
01:23:24.14 --> 01:23:26.02
than because the other thing about it,

1789
01:23:26.02 --> 01:23:28.62
authoritarian mindset is they don't do well in combat

1790
01:23:28.62 --> 01:23:30.62
situations oftentimes because they

1791
01:23:30.62 --> 01:23:32.18
have a very structured mind.

1792
01:23:32.18 --> 01:23:34.34
They have a very predetermined way of thinking.

1793
01:23:34.34 --> 01:23:36.50
So they get thrown something that they didn't expect

1794
01:23:36.50 --> 01:23:38.50
and they just fall apart.

1795
01:23:38.50 --> 01:23:40.78
You know, the person that's great in garrison,

1796
01:23:40.78 --> 01:23:44.02
that's great at keeping everyone great at doing inspections,

1797
01:23:44.02 --> 01:23:47.14
great at keeping everyone in the proper uniform,

1798
01:23:47.14 --> 01:23:49.42
they get into combat where all of a sudden the enemy gets

1799
01:23:49.42 --> 01:23:51.66
a vote and there's things happening they didn't expect.

1800
01:23:51.66 --> 01:23:52.70
And people are getting shot.

1801
01:23:52.70 --> 01:23:56.30
And a lot of times, those people don't do well

1802
01:23:56.30 --> 01:23:58.22
in combat scenarios.

1803
01:23:58.22 --> 01:24:01.06
Well, there's something about that that

1804
01:24:01.06 --> 01:24:04.50
just occurs to me right now is that on consolation

1805
01:24:04.50 --> 01:24:07.02
for that 10 month, 9 month cruise,

1806
01:24:07.02 --> 01:24:08.86
I never heard of that happening.

1807
01:24:08.86 --> 01:24:12.94
And you had two squadrons of A7s, two squadrons of A4s,

1808
01:24:12.94 --> 01:24:17.86
one squadron of A6s, a detachment of RA5Cs,

1809
01:24:17.86 --> 01:24:21.42
and combat helo squadron from Japan,

1810
01:24:21.42 --> 01:24:24.06
squadron, whatever they were.

1811
01:24:24.06 --> 01:24:28.78
I think there were two armored heavy duty helicopters

1812
01:24:28.78 --> 01:24:31.74
and the guys who stood by the machine gun.

1813
01:24:31.74 --> 01:24:33.90
I never heard of anything like that.

1814
01:24:33.90 --> 01:24:35.22
Anything like what?

1815
01:24:35.22 --> 01:24:39.70
Anybody screwing up or refusing or being unable to

1816
01:24:39.70 --> 01:24:40.94
or anything like that.

1817
01:24:40.94 --> 01:24:45.94
And they were using real bullets and stuff there every night.

1818
01:24:46.10 --> 01:24:47.62
Yeah, well, it's an interesting thing too

1819
01:24:47.62 --> 01:24:52.62
about the Navy in general is that the Navy in its nature

1820
01:24:54.50 --> 01:24:59.50
when from the past, if you were a commander in my fleet

1821
01:24:59.86 --> 01:25:02.42
and I was gonna send you and your ship somewhere,

1822
01:25:02.42 --> 01:25:03.90
I wasn't gonna be able to talk to you again.

1823
01:25:03.90 --> 01:25:04.74
That's right.

1824
01:25:04.74 --> 01:25:05.58
So you-

1825
01:25:05.58 --> 01:25:07.82
Except with flags and only till you go over the run.

1826
01:25:07.82 --> 01:25:09.58
Right, and then it was like up to you.

1827
01:25:09.58 --> 01:25:13.70
And so we had to exercise a decentralized command

1828
01:25:13.70 --> 01:25:15.94
more than anybody else.

1829
01:25:15.94 --> 01:25:18.70
And that really, when you really pull the thread

1830
01:25:18.70 --> 01:25:22.02
on the SEAL teams, that becomes very clear

1831
01:25:22.02 --> 01:25:24.78
that that's one of the reasons why the SEAL teams

1832
01:25:24.78 --> 01:25:26.98
has a reputation for being very adaptable

1833
01:25:26.98 --> 01:25:28.54
and figuring things out.

1834
01:25:28.54 --> 01:25:31.10
Because we wouldn't get support all the time.

1835
01:25:31.10 --> 01:25:34.02
And we had to, just being in the Navy,

1836
01:25:34.02 --> 01:25:36.18
you had to figure things out.

1837
01:25:36.18 --> 01:25:39.42
The other thing is, in the Navy,

1838
01:25:39.42 --> 01:25:43.34
historically, if you're on a ship, you can't surrender.

1839
01:25:43.34 --> 01:25:44.50
You can't surrender.

1840
01:25:44.50 --> 01:25:47.06
You have to just fight until your ship goes down.

1841
01:25:47.06 --> 01:25:49.26
There's no quitting because you'll die.

1842
01:25:49.26 --> 01:25:53.06
So you end up with that attitude embedded as well

1843
01:25:53.06 --> 01:25:54.10
in the mindset.

1844
01:25:55.46 --> 01:25:58.26
But the, and I think there's a lot of that

1845
01:25:58.26 --> 01:26:01.42
with pilots as well, is, hey, look,

1846
01:26:01.42 --> 01:26:06.42
I'm gonna do what makes sense for me and my aircraft

1847
01:26:06.42 --> 01:26:08.22
to make sure that I stay alive.

1848
01:26:08.22 --> 01:26:10.86
And you have to make those decisions for yourself.

1849
01:26:10.86 --> 01:26:12.30
And so it's on you.

1850
01:26:12.30 --> 01:26:16.22
Well, when I was in Thailand, to my shock,

1851
01:26:17.18 --> 01:26:19.54
flying with FACTS, Air Force FACTS,

1852
01:26:19.54 --> 01:26:21.86
I never told them I was a previous Air Force.

1853
01:26:21.86 --> 01:26:24.58
I thought that's too controversial.

1854
01:26:24.58 --> 01:26:26.14
I'm not gonna get into that.

1855
01:26:26.14 --> 01:26:27.34
I just let it go.

1856
01:26:28.22 --> 01:26:31.66
And they see these guys, Air Force guys,

1857
01:26:31.66 --> 01:26:33.70
doing 30 degree dives.

1858
01:26:33.70 --> 01:26:35.46
And I thought, that's crazy.

1859
01:26:35.46 --> 01:26:40.38
You asked to be at least 45, at least, at 60.

1860
01:26:40.38 --> 01:26:43.50
And of course, what I did was as steep as you could get.

1861
01:26:43.50 --> 01:26:46.78
Hell with it, I'm not gonna get shot down here and so forth.

1862
01:26:46.78 --> 01:26:48.54
But 30 degree dives.

1863
01:26:48.54 --> 01:26:50.26
And I think they all did that.

1864
01:26:50.26 --> 01:26:53.18
And they had the same charts that Navy had.

1865
01:26:54.06 --> 01:26:56.22
So, and the Air Force was known for charts,

1866
01:26:56.22 --> 01:26:58.06
but maybe theirs were even better,

1867
01:26:58.06 --> 01:27:02.58
or more complete or larger than what we had.

1868
01:27:02.58 --> 01:27:04.66
But you couldn't hit the ground.

1869
01:27:04.66 --> 01:27:06.82
Yeah, you're gonna dive in 60 degree dive,

1870
01:27:06.82 --> 01:27:09.06
in the middle of the night, are you nuts?

1871
01:27:09.06 --> 01:27:10.30
You can't hit the ground.

1872
01:27:10.30 --> 01:27:12.14
What happens if they got a tower up there?

1873
01:27:12.14 --> 01:27:14.46
Well, you're still, you're gonna be a thousand feet

1874
01:27:14.46 --> 01:27:15.94
clearer than that.

1875
01:27:15.94 --> 01:27:19.90
So, if you use a 6,000 foot release

1876
01:27:19.90 --> 01:27:24.90
and a 550 degree dive, a 550 knot dive

1877
01:27:25.46 --> 01:27:29.94
and 500 knot release, and a 60 or 80 degree dive,

1878
01:27:29.94 --> 01:27:31.14
you're not gonna hit the ground.

1879
01:27:31.14 --> 01:27:32.06
Don't worry about it.

1880
01:27:32.06 --> 01:27:33.34
You won't do it.

1881
01:27:33.34 --> 01:27:34.26
It can't.

1882
01:27:34.26 --> 01:27:35.46
You won't.

1883
01:27:35.46 --> 01:27:37.34
And what do you pull in seven Gs at the bottom

1884
01:27:37.34 --> 01:27:38.18
of that string?

1885
01:27:38.18 --> 01:27:40.98
Six and a half is what we usually did, I think.

1886
01:27:40.98 --> 01:27:43.82
And if you look down, or you're doing it,

1887
01:27:43.82 --> 01:27:46.98
the needle's just doing that just above six.

1888
01:27:47.98 --> 01:27:51.02
You would look down from time to time at that.

1889
01:27:51.02 --> 01:27:52.90
If you're pulling out, you learn nothing else

1890
01:27:52.90 --> 01:27:54.06
to look at anyway.

1891
01:27:54.06 --> 01:27:55.70
Yeah, I think that's a number you're saying

1892
01:27:55.70 --> 01:27:57.62
as I listen to you talk about it.

1893
01:27:57.62 --> 01:28:00.34
It is a little surprising that you wouldn't do

1894
01:28:00.34 --> 01:28:02.90
a steeper dive, especially in that airplane,

1895
01:28:02.90 --> 01:28:04.38
because you're also more accurate.

1896
01:28:04.38 --> 01:28:05.94
You know where your bomb's gonna go.

1897
01:28:05.94 --> 01:28:09.06
And to be quite honest, like six and a half Gs

1898
01:28:09.06 --> 01:28:10.86
is not that hard if you get used to it.

1899
01:28:10.86 --> 01:28:12.86
And if it keeps you from-

1900
01:28:12.86 --> 01:28:13.70
From becoming ordinary.

1901
01:28:13.70 --> 01:28:14.78
Yeah, it's not that big of a deal.

1902
01:28:14.78 --> 01:28:16.26
Any pilot could get used to that.

1903
01:28:16.26 --> 01:28:17.58
I think the biggest problem is people

1904
01:28:17.58 --> 01:28:19.18
don't like doing that stuff at night.

1905
01:28:19.18 --> 01:28:22.18
And that to me is, it's interesting

1906
01:28:22.18 --> 01:28:23.90
that more people didn't have the same logic

1907
01:28:23.90 --> 01:28:25.46
that you had, which is steeper is better.

1908
01:28:25.46 --> 01:28:26.86
And I just do the math.

1909
01:28:26.86 --> 01:28:28.34
I got a minute altitude to recover from.

1910
01:28:28.34 --> 01:28:29.46
And if I pull back on the stick,

1911
01:28:29.46 --> 01:28:31.10
I can survive six and a half Gs, no factor.

1912
01:28:31.10 --> 01:28:32.50
And I'll pull out and I'll be fine.

1913
01:28:32.50 --> 01:28:34.22
Yeah, because of the engineering knowledge

1914
01:28:34.22 --> 01:28:36.14
is right there on the paper.

1915
01:28:36.14 --> 01:28:38.10
You could see it, but-

1916
01:28:38.10 --> 01:28:40.34
A 30 degree dive seems,

1917
01:28:40.34 --> 01:28:42.66
I didn't even know that was even something

1918
01:28:42.66 --> 01:28:43.50
that you were doing.

1919
01:28:43.50 --> 01:28:46.10
That's a shallow, it's especially in a place like that

1920
01:28:46.10 --> 01:28:51.10
where ground fire, not the Sam's,

1921
01:28:51.14 --> 01:28:52.74
although I know Sam's are always considered,

1922
01:28:52.74 --> 01:28:56.74
but AAA, like a 30 degree airplane's a big giant airplane.

1923
01:28:56.74 --> 01:28:59.18
There's just a lot of airplane to see at 30 degrees

1924
01:28:59.18 --> 01:29:00.98
where 60 degrees or 70 degrees,

1925
01:29:00.98 --> 01:29:02.82
there's a very little amount of airplane to see.

1926
01:29:02.82 --> 01:29:04.66
And I would think that's the math game you would be playing

1927
01:29:04.66 --> 01:29:06.90
is a smaller platform, the better.

1928
01:29:06.90 --> 01:29:08.06
I got one better than that.

1929
01:29:08.06 --> 01:29:10.66
I was with this OV10 guy, I'm riding in the back

1930
01:29:10.66 --> 01:29:13.98
with the binoculars and these two F4 showed up

1931
01:29:13.98 --> 01:29:17.94
and they made about three runs from the same direction,

1932
01:29:17.94 --> 01:29:20.82
30 degree dives, one after the other.

1933
01:29:20.82 --> 01:29:21.66
That's crazy.

1934
01:29:21.66 --> 01:29:22.66
Are you nuts?

1935
01:29:22.66 --> 01:29:25.86
You always come in from over there.

1936
01:29:25.86 --> 01:29:28.94
And one then that you made one dive from over there,

1937
01:29:28.94 --> 01:29:32.90
you over here for your second, we used to drop pairs

1938
01:29:32.90 --> 01:29:34.94
and we have six, 500 pound bombs

1939
01:29:34.94 --> 01:29:38.86
and make three runs with pairs,

1940
01:29:38.86 --> 01:29:41.34
but never from the same direction, never.

1941
01:29:41.34 --> 01:29:44.02
And when the lead goes in over here,

1942
01:29:44.02 --> 01:29:46.94
turn a little around the circle and come in from the other side

1943
01:29:46.94 --> 01:29:48.66
because that means he's got to turn the gun

1944
01:29:48.66 --> 01:29:50.70
all the way around over there.

1945
01:29:50.70 --> 01:29:52.98
Because he was shooting at him.

1946
01:29:52.98 --> 01:29:55.74
The thing is, that's another thing about the first guy in,

1947
01:29:55.74 --> 01:29:58.58
in the movies, John Wayne is the first guy in,

1948
01:29:58.58 --> 01:30:00.70
it's not a big deal, they're still getting the gun turned

1949
01:30:00.70 --> 01:30:03.38
around and he's off the target by the hand.

1950
01:30:03.38 --> 01:30:04.70
It's the second guy.

1951
01:30:04.70 --> 01:30:05.86
Dash four, that's the last guy.

1952
01:30:05.86 --> 01:30:09.02
Dash two, dash three, dash four, the ones that take it.

1953
01:30:09.02 --> 01:30:10.54
That's right.

1954
01:30:10.54 --> 01:30:12.70
So you feel like you were pretty good

1955
01:30:12.70 --> 01:30:14.14
prepared for that deployment.

1956
01:30:14.14 --> 01:30:17.54
You were out bombing, you were doing these steep things,

1957
01:30:17.54 --> 01:30:18.94
getting ready to deploy.

1958
01:30:18.94 --> 01:30:20.58
I was getting better at that

1959
01:30:21.46 --> 01:30:24.58
and I didn't get good at it until we were over there.

1960
01:30:24.58 --> 01:30:25.42
And,

1961
01:30:25.42 --> 01:30:26.26
and,

1962
01:30:28.26 --> 01:30:29.10
you know, they,

1963
01:30:29.94 --> 01:30:33.06
they don't emphasize, they don't talk about the fact

1964
01:30:33.06 --> 01:30:36.82
that there's a lot of flak and you will see it going by.

1965
01:30:36.82 --> 01:30:38.74
They don't tell you that.

1966
01:30:38.74 --> 01:30:41.82
Because maybe they're afraid of somebody saying,

1967
01:30:41.82 --> 01:30:44.26
not for me, I got a bad cold.

1968
01:30:44.26 --> 01:30:46.18
And I think I got a permanent cold

1969
01:30:46.18 --> 01:30:50.58
and maybe I do a lot better in Iceland

1970
01:30:50.58 --> 01:30:53.06
and then doing this.

1971
01:30:53.06 --> 01:30:58.06
So I don't know, but, the other thing about

1972
01:30:59.74 --> 01:31:03.22
that being prepared was the advent.

1973
01:31:03.22 --> 01:31:08.22
I said to David, the only, my real claim to fame here,

1974
01:31:08.78 --> 01:31:10.86
because I'm pretty ordinary actually,

1975
01:31:10.86 --> 01:31:14.70
was the fact that I was there when Sam Leeds walked around

1976
01:31:14.70 --> 01:31:17.78
VF 121 and said, we're going to start this thing

1977
01:31:17.78 --> 01:31:19.86
and maybe you might want to be part of it

1978
01:31:19.86 --> 01:31:23.50
because we don't want to have any more foreshot down

1979
01:31:23.50 --> 01:31:27.50
by MiG-17s, not so much 21s, but MiG-17s.

1980
01:31:27.50 --> 01:31:28.62
What do they call it?

1981
01:31:28.62 --> 01:31:30.10
Was it called the Advanced Gunnery School?

1982
01:31:30.10 --> 01:31:30.94
Do you remember what it was called?

1983
01:31:30.94 --> 01:31:34.18
No, they called it Navy Advanced Fighter Weapon School.

1984
01:31:34.18 --> 01:31:35.58
Okay.

1985
01:31:35.58 --> 01:31:38.18
Or it could, I think initially they said,

1986
01:31:38.18 --> 01:31:40.46
it might be called something like that.

1987
01:31:40.46 --> 01:31:42.30
It was all very loose.

1988
01:31:42.30 --> 01:31:45.10
And I think they had okay for somebody

1989
01:31:45.10 --> 01:31:47.54
on the Admiral's staff in North Island,

1990
01:31:47.54 --> 01:31:50.18
but it was very loose.

1991
01:31:50.18 --> 01:31:55.18
And they said, if you volunteer, you'll fly extra time

1992
01:31:56.46 --> 01:31:57.82
and maybe you don't want to do it

1993
01:31:57.82 --> 01:32:00.78
because it's going to be at six o'clock in the morning.

1994
01:32:00.78 --> 01:32:03.74
And if you don't fly, you have to be here at six,

1995
01:32:03.74 --> 01:32:08.74
at 430 in the morning to man up and run the airplanes out

1996
01:32:08.86 --> 01:32:11.86
and make sure everything on the airplane,

1997
01:32:11.86 --> 01:32:15.06
systems, engines and whatnot, and the radar works

1998
01:32:15.06 --> 01:32:17.82
because you're going to have an experienced,

1999
01:32:17.82 --> 01:32:22.06
good guy in your back seat just for this morning exercise

2000
01:32:22.06 --> 01:32:25.74
so that when we put two, four airplanes out

2001
01:32:25.74 --> 01:32:29.58
on the parking ramp, they all work and all the radars work.

2002
01:32:29.58 --> 01:32:31.78
So be ready for that.

2003
01:32:31.78 --> 01:32:35.78
You will be here at 435 o'clock in the morning

2004
01:32:35.78 --> 01:32:37.54
and you won't fly.

2005
01:32:37.54 --> 01:32:40.42
Ooh, a lot of guys say, forget that.

2006
01:32:40.42 --> 01:32:41.46
So did you do it?

2007
01:32:41.46 --> 01:32:42.74
I did it, yeah.

2008
01:32:42.74 --> 01:32:47.74
And it was, and you will fly ACM,

2009
01:32:50.42 --> 01:32:55.42
air combat maneuver with our instructors and so forth.

2010
01:32:57.10 --> 01:33:00.50
One of my claims to fame is flying with Sam Leeds

2011
01:33:00.50 --> 01:33:03.82
and an A4, they had, at that point,

2012
01:33:03.82 --> 01:33:06.38
they had several generations of A4s

2013
01:33:06.38 --> 01:33:08.14
and they had two seat A4s

2014
01:33:08.14 --> 01:33:09.94
and I think a couple of single seats.

2015
01:33:09.94 --> 01:33:11.62
They had a much bigger engine than them

2016
01:33:11.62 --> 01:33:16.62
and they had, for the instrument rag at Miramar,

2017
01:33:16.86 --> 01:33:19.86
they had a couple with the big engines in them

2018
01:33:19.86 --> 01:33:24.86
and that's when they flew at imitating the MiG-17.

2019
01:33:24.94 --> 01:33:27.74
Don't get close to this guy, he'll eat you alive,

2020
01:33:27.74 --> 01:33:32.66
which is true and that's, Duke Cunningham

2021
01:33:32.66 --> 01:33:34.14
should have been shot down.

2022
01:33:34.14 --> 01:33:36.30
He should have been shot down a couple of times.

2023
01:33:36.30 --> 01:33:39.38
He was very lucky, just lucky.

2024
01:33:39.38 --> 01:33:42.78
But at any rate, doing the wrong thing with Sam Leeds

2025
01:33:42.78 --> 01:33:44.62
isn't my bragging point.

2026
01:33:45.74 --> 01:33:49.82
One of the few ones, he came in on me

2027
01:33:49.82 --> 01:33:52.70
trying to suck me into a, what's called a scissors,

2028
01:33:52.70 --> 01:33:54.62
it's two airplanes who do this,

2029
01:33:54.62 --> 01:33:57.90
one trying to be slower than the other guy

2030
01:33:57.90 --> 01:34:00.90
and I rolled over the top on him and went to Burner

2031
01:34:00.90 --> 01:34:05.74
and I was standing there upside down above him in Burner

2032
01:34:05.74 --> 01:34:09.58
and he said, I can still in my mind I see him

2033
01:34:09.58 --> 01:34:12.06
looking up at me and he said to me,

2034
01:34:12.06 --> 01:34:14.34
I can't believe you're doing this,

2035
01:34:14.34 --> 01:34:16.38
which is the wrong thing to do.

2036
01:34:16.38 --> 01:34:19.82
That would be a last resort with a MiG-17

2037
01:34:19.82 --> 01:34:22.74
because if you screw it up, he's gonna kill you.

2038
01:34:24.30 --> 01:34:26.46
You were a phantom and he was in an A4?

2039
01:34:26.46 --> 01:34:27.30
Yeah.

2040
01:34:28.46 --> 01:34:31.22
But I was standing upside down on my tail

2041
01:34:31.22 --> 01:34:34.58
in Max Burner to do that

2042
01:34:34.58 --> 01:34:38.54
and Sam Leeds was a nice guy.

2043
01:34:38.54 --> 01:34:41.82
Dan Peterson is a little bit removed,

2044
01:34:41.82 --> 01:34:45.42
a little bit standoffish, sort of guy,

2045
01:34:45.42 --> 01:34:47.10
not a bad guy or anything like that,

2046
01:34:47.10 --> 01:34:48.50
but a little bit standoff.

2047
01:34:48.50 --> 01:34:51.34
But Sam Leeds was, how the hell are you a sort of guy?

2048
01:34:52.50 --> 01:34:55.34
At any rate, he said to me, I can't believe you're doing that.

2049
01:34:57.42 --> 01:35:00.22
Aviation and sticking rudder stuff.

2050
01:35:01.14 --> 01:35:03.14
Okay, so now you're deploying to Vietnam.

2051
01:35:03.14 --> 01:35:04.62
Do you just load on the aircraft carrier?

2052
01:35:04.62 --> 01:35:06.42
You're on the USS Constellation?

2053
01:35:06.42 --> 01:35:08.10
No, you're going on mini-cruise

2054
01:35:08.90 --> 01:35:12.10
for Monday through Friday,

2055
01:35:12.10 --> 01:35:14.02
it was supposed to be or it was,

2056
01:35:15.14 --> 01:35:18.22
for a month, for four weeks.

2057
01:35:20.34 --> 01:35:23.30
Well, before they let you near the ship,

2058
01:35:23.30 --> 01:35:26.94
you have to, pure care quality, that's all you do.

2059
01:35:26.94 --> 01:35:29.78
And we went to the East Coast to do that.

2060
01:35:29.78 --> 01:35:34.50
The bunch I was with and it was winter time.

2061
01:35:34.50 --> 01:35:38.54
Poopy suits back in those days, rubber immersion suits.

2062
01:35:38.54 --> 01:35:39.90
Did you ever wear one?

2063
01:35:39.90 --> 01:35:41.50
Absolutely, yeah.

2064
01:35:41.50 --> 01:35:42.34
Good times.

2065
01:35:43.22 --> 01:35:45.58
What is this in case you're ejecting the water?

2066
01:35:45.58 --> 01:35:46.86
The water's below a certain temperature,

2067
01:35:46.86 --> 01:35:48.98
you die super fast, so you got to wear this

2068
01:35:48.98 --> 01:35:50.82
immersion suit in case you eject into the ocean.

2069
01:35:50.82 --> 01:35:53.14
So it's just a big rubber suit that sucks.

2070
01:35:53.14 --> 01:35:55.46
I'm not going to complain about it in front of a seal.

2071
01:35:55.46 --> 01:35:56.86
It's not cool.

2072
01:35:56.86 --> 01:36:00.10
No, it's the water and air temperature,

2073
01:36:00.10 --> 01:36:01.98
less than a certain number.

2074
01:36:01.98 --> 01:36:04.46
And they're not supposed to leak,

2075
01:36:04.46 --> 01:36:08.14
but everybody, power chute rigors and people like that,

2076
01:36:08.14 --> 01:36:09.86
I'm saying, don't worry, they all leak.

2077
01:36:11.02 --> 01:36:13.98
And the other thing is getting into this thing.

2078
01:36:13.98 --> 01:36:18.54
The zipper goes from here to down here somewhere.

2079
01:36:18.54 --> 01:36:20.78
So how do you get your head through there?

2080
01:36:20.78 --> 01:36:24.18
Basically, shoulders up, get somebody to help you

2081
01:36:24.18 --> 01:36:26.18
and pull it up over your head

2082
01:36:26.18 --> 01:36:28.98
and then he lets go and it takes your ears off,

2083
01:36:28.98 --> 01:36:31.30
so to speak, and pulling down because it makes

2084
01:36:31.30 --> 01:36:36.18
a tight seal around your neck and above your neck.

2085
01:36:36.18 --> 01:36:39.62
I guess you have no protection from the seawater either,

2086
01:36:39.62 --> 01:36:41.10
but I don't know.

2087
01:36:41.10 --> 01:36:44.58
And then around the wrists, so your hands

2088
01:36:44.58 --> 01:36:46.50
are going to get ice cold.

2089
01:36:46.50 --> 01:36:51.22
The problem is you, in that, maybe you know this,

2090
01:36:51.22 --> 01:36:54.90
in cold water like that, North Atlantic and whatnot,

2091
01:36:54.90 --> 01:36:57.14
you stop breathing, you can't breathe,

2092
01:36:57.14 --> 01:37:02.14
you're fully conscious, but your diaphragm cools down

2093
01:37:02.94 --> 01:37:04.74
and it won't work for you.

2094
01:37:04.74 --> 01:37:09.18
So you're going to drown because now your swimming ability

2095
01:37:09.18 --> 01:37:14.18
is falling than your diaphragm just will not make,

2096
01:37:15.98 --> 01:37:17.62
get oxygen for you.

2097
01:37:19.78 --> 01:37:21.22
You're done.

2098
01:37:21.22 --> 01:37:24.42
But then my first traps in the F4

2099
01:37:24.42 --> 01:37:29.42
were in a poopy suit off Norfolk in March or February.

2100
01:37:30.02 --> 01:37:32.86
I can't remember, not that it matters.

2101
01:37:33.70 --> 01:37:38.74
And then you board the carrier and you guys sail over?

2102
01:37:38.74 --> 01:37:41.18
Yeah, once you get, they give you, well they did,

2103
01:37:41.18 --> 01:37:43.74
I don't know how they do it now, but in the F4,

2104
01:37:43.74 --> 01:37:45.94
they gave you about four day traps.

2105
01:37:45.94 --> 01:37:49.42
One, your initial, in my case I flew aboard,

2106
01:37:49.42 --> 01:37:54.42
you fly aboard, you walk off, but your initial day trap

2107
01:37:55.54 --> 01:38:00.14
and then next day, maybe two, maybe one,

2108
01:38:00.14 --> 01:38:03.26
and so we're getting you used to the whole idea.

2109
01:38:03.26 --> 01:38:06.10
And after you have about four, five, or six,

2110
01:38:06.10 --> 01:38:07.38
I can't remember what it was.

2111
01:38:07.38 --> 01:38:11.10
Then you get your first night, which is thrilling.

2112
01:38:13.46 --> 01:38:16.22
Nick Far, Nick Soho.

2113
01:38:16.22 --> 01:38:17.82
What's Nick Far?

2114
01:38:17.82 --> 01:38:19.54
German.

2115
01:38:19.54 --> 01:38:20.62
What does it mean?

2116
01:38:20.62 --> 01:38:21.78
Not so.

2117
01:38:21.78 --> 01:38:22.62
Oh, okay.

2118
01:38:24.62 --> 01:38:26.62
He's just being facetious when he's in the industry.

2119
01:38:26.62 --> 01:38:27.46
Yeah, no.

2120
01:38:28.82 --> 01:38:29.82
Burke Burkey.

2121
01:38:29.82 --> 01:38:33.82
Anyway, I got my first night,

2122
01:38:33.82 --> 01:38:38.82
they shot me off the bow of America, CV-A66,

2123
01:38:38.82 --> 01:38:42.02
and I thought, holy smoke, it's being shot into a cave,

2124
01:38:42.02 --> 01:38:45.22
and I can't fly this crazy thing, calm down Tom.

2125
01:38:45.22 --> 01:38:48.10
All right, and you go up and around and get on the downwind.

2126
01:38:48.10 --> 01:38:50.14
Don't look at the ship, they told you.

2127
01:38:50.14 --> 01:38:51.98
Do not look over at the ship,

2128
01:38:51.98 --> 01:38:54.22
it will give you a case of vertigo

2129
01:38:54.22 --> 01:38:56.10
or spatial disorientation.

2130
01:38:56.10 --> 01:38:58.42
Do not look at the ship.

2131
01:38:58.42 --> 01:38:59.94
You just look at your instruments?

2132
01:38:59.94 --> 01:39:00.86
Yeah.

2133
01:39:00.86 --> 01:39:05.86
And it was an overcast night, so high overcast.

2134
01:39:05.90 --> 01:39:09.26
I could see the ship in the corner of my eye over here,

2135
01:39:09.26 --> 01:39:12.90
driving on the downwind, driving on the downwind,

2136
01:39:12.90 --> 01:39:15.34
and I just sat over there and took a look.

2137
01:39:15.34 --> 01:39:18.66
That's what they told you, don't look at the ship?

2138
01:39:18.66 --> 01:39:19.78
Don't look at the ship.

2139
01:39:19.78 --> 01:39:21.34
I did, I can tell you.

2140
01:39:21.34 --> 01:39:23.18
Well, I don't understand, why does it freak you out?

2141
01:39:23.18 --> 01:39:24.02
I have no idea.

2142
01:39:24.02 --> 01:39:26.14
Is that the same thing they told you, Dave?

2143
01:39:26.14 --> 01:39:29.50
Yeah, so it's just a spatial thing, you look out,

2144
01:39:29.50 --> 01:39:31.82
there's no, when he's talking about, there's no horizon.

2145
01:39:31.82 --> 01:39:33.62
You have no sense of where flat or level

2146
01:39:33.62 --> 01:39:35.90
or the sky and the water meet.

2147
01:39:35.90 --> 01:39:37.50
And so if you look over, which we all do,

2148
01:39:37.50 --> 01:39:38.42
because you'll find the downwind,

2149
01:39:38.42 --> 01:39:39.74
if you look to your left, the ship is there,

2150
01:39:39.74 --> 01:39:41.46
you cannot not look.

2151
01:39:41.46 --> 01:39:43.02
Oh, yeah.

2152
01:39:43.02 --> 01:39:44.18
And then you get confused.

2153
01:39:44.18 --> 01:39:46.86
The lights give you disorient you as to,

2154
01:39:46.86 --> 01:39:49.34
when you see lights, lights should either be up or down,

2155
01:39:49.34 --> 01:39:51.06
so it creates disorientation,

2156
01:39:51.06 --> 01:39:53.42
which you can recover from by looking at instruments,

2157
01:39:53.42 --> 01:39:55.18
but don't look at the ship,

2158
01:39:55.18 --> 01:39:56.70
everybody's told the same thing.

2159
01:39:56.70 --> 01:40:00.06
There's no line between the blackness that is the water,

2160
01:40:00.06 --> 01:40:02.46
the blackness that is behind the ship,

2161
01:40:02.46 --> 01:40:04.50
and the blackness that is over the ship.

2162
01:40:04.50 --> 01:40:06.10
The ship is just sort of floating

2163
01:40:06.10 --> 01:40:09.70
in black space somehow or other.

2164
01:40:09.70 --> 01:40:12.30
I'm getting dizzy just thinking about it.

2165
01:40:12.30 --> 01:40:15.30
Do you ever get used to landing on the carrier?

2166
01:40:15.30 --> 01:40:17.66
Well, that's part, this second part of this.

2167
01:40:17.66 --> 01:40:20.22
So I got aboard and went below.

2168
01:40:20.22 --> 01:40:21.82
And there's a Lieutenant Commander,

2169
01:40:21.82 --> 01:40:23.38
a nice guy from Miramar,

2170
01:40:23.38 --> 01:40:27.74
who was there getting re-upped to go to sea.

2171
01:40:27.74 --> 01:40:31.94
And I went to the ward room on Constellation,

2172
01:40:31.94 --> 01:40:34.02
the main ward room was the second deck.

2173
01:40:34.02 --> 01:40:36.82
So I went down there and I got my coffee

2174
01:40:36.82 --> 01:40:39.10
and I got my donut or whatever it was.

2175
01:40:39.10 --> 01:40:40.98
And he said, pretty dark out there.

2176
01:40:40.98 --> 01:40:44.94
And I said, phew, I had no idea.

2177
01:40:44.94 --> 01:40:47.74
I thought I would know, but he said,

2178
01:40:47.74 --> 01:40:50.30
well, you'll get used to it in the daytime.

2179
01:40:50.30 --> 01:40:54.14
It gets to be fun in the daytime, which is true,

2180
01:40:54.14 --> 01:40:59.14
but nobody ever likes it at night, which is true.

2181
01:40:59.86 --> 01:41:00.70
They have confirmed.

2182
01:41:00.70 --> 01:41:01.98
100%

2183
01:41:01.98 --> 01:41:05.26
Daytime can be fun, nighttime not so much.

2184
01:41:05.26 --> 01:41:06.98
That's right, it's 100% true.

2185
01:41:06.98 --> 01:41:08.62
Full moon is pretty easy?

2186
01:41:08.62 --> 01:41:11.74
No, it's worse because you got shadows

2187
01:41:11.74 --> 01:41:15.74
and you'd make a turn and the moon is there

2188
01:41:15.74 --> 01:41:18.30
and it puts a light across your cockpit

2189
01:41:18.30 --> 01:41:21.70
and it travels across and gives you

2190
01:41:21.70 --> 01:41:24.54
a mild case of special disorientation.

2191
01:41:24.54 --> 01:41:26.46
You don't want that, black is better.

2192
01:41:26.46 --> 01:41:28.26
And then you just on the gauges

2193
01:41:28.26 --> 01:41:31.30
and that's an end of it until the guy says,

2194
01:41:31.30 --> 01:41:33.30
three quarters of a mile, call a ball.

2195
01:41:33.30 --> 01:41:38.30
And assuming you're on centerline,

2196
01:41:38.58 --> 01:41:40.38
on glidescope at that point,

2197
01:41:40.38 --> 01:41:43.50
that basically you just got to wait it out.

2198
01:41:43.50 --> 01:41:45.30
But that's how I got in trouble,

2199
01:41:45.30 --> 01:41:48.34
so which is in those notes.

2200
01:41:48.34 --> 01:41:49.38
Are you looking at my notes?

2201
01:41:49.38 --> 01:41:52.46
Different notes, but it comes from the same thing.

2202
01:41:52.46 --> 01:41:53.38
What got you in trouble?

2203
01:41:53.38 --> 01:41:54.38
I'm interested just.

2204
01:41:54.38 --> 01:41:57.70
Lower your nose in close, come down one wire.

2205
01:41:57.70 --> 01:41:58.54
Not good.

2206
01:41:58.54 --> 01:42:00.34
What happened?

2207
01:42:00.34 --> 01:42:03.70
Well, you bolted and you said.

2208
01:42:03.70 --> 01:42:04.54
What's that mean?

2209
01:42:04.54 --> 01:42:06.62
I'm sorry, no wire, you don't get a wire

2210
01:42:06.62 --> 01:42:09.42
and the lights come on and you're off the angle.

2211
01:42:09.42 --> 01:42:10.82
Oh, okay, you're too high into land.

2212
01:42:10.82 --> 01:42:11.66
Stay too high.

2213
01:42:11.66 --> 01:42:12.82
You miss.

2214
01:42:12.82 --> 01:42:14.50
It can happen, you can be innocent

2215
01:42:14.50 --> 01:42:16.50
and the wires are staggered.

2216
01:42:16.50 --> 01:42:20.74
They're not the same space so that if you have a hook skip,

2217
01:42:20.74 --> 01:42:22.78
you can even hook skip two wires.

2218
01:42:22.78 --> 01:42:27.42
It has happened and off the angle you go and rats.

2219
01:42:27.42 --> 01:42:28.26
What'd you call it?

2220
01:42:28.26 --> 01:42:29.46
What's the verb for it?

2221
01:42:29.46 --> 01:42:30.38
Bolter.

2222
01:42:30.38 --> 01:42:31.22
Bolter?

2223
01:42:31.22 --> 01:42:32.22
B-O-L-T-E-R.

2224
01:42:32.22 --> 01:42:33.42
That means that you miss the wire.

2225
01:42:33.42 --> 01:42:35.74
Yeah, and the L-S-O, he's very helpful.

2226
01:42:35.74 --> 01:42:37.22
You know what he says?

2227
01:42:37.22 --> 01:42:38.86
Bolter bolt, bolter bolt.

2228
01:42:38.86 --> 01:42:39.94
Yeah, thanks a lot.

2229
01:42:41.78 --> 01:42:45.46
And so as soon as you miss, you have to floor.

2230
01:42:45.46 --> 01:42:48.90
Well, when you touch down, you go to full power.

2231
01:42:48.90 --> 01:42:50.06
Oh, that's regardless, okay.

2232
01:42:50.06 --> 01:42:54.62
Yeah, basic engine and from time to time on the F-4 anyway,

2233
01:42:54.62 --> 01:42:56.82
the engines would be slightly misrigged

2234
01:42:56.82 --> 01:42:59.18
and one of them would go to Minn Burner

2235
01:42:59.18 --> 01:43:01.50
and the ship would go ape shit and telling,

2236
01:43:01.50 --> 01:43:04.06
oh no, you've got to do yelling at you,

2237
01:43:04.06 --> 01:43:05.74
come out of a burner and things like that.

2238
01:43:05.74 --> 01:43:06.74
Didn't mean anything.

2239
01:43:06.74 --> 01:43:09.18
So you have the bolter bolter, then what happens?

2240
01:43:10.18 --> 01:43:11.46
Did he say he got you into trouble?

2241
01:43:11.46 --> 01:43:13.58
Yeah, I guess the ship is on the same,

2242
01:43:13.58 --> 01:43:18.58
their radar facility, the CCI, is on the same frequency

2243
01:43:19.66 --> 01:43:22.90
and they hear the L-S-O say bolter bolter

2244
01:43:22.90 --> 01:43:25.66
and they'll say two and two.

2245
01:43:25.66 --> 01:43:29.42
Continue straight ahead to 500 feet, turn left heading

2246
01:43:29.42 --> 01:43:31.78
bus and so which would be a crosswind

2247
01:43:31.78 --> 01:43:35.46
and then you do that and climate maintain 1200 feet

2248
01:43:35.46 --> 01:43:39.34
or 1000 feet or whatever it is and turn left to bus

2249
01:43:39.34 --> 01:43:41.38
and so on, then you're on the downwind

2250
01:43:41.38 --> 01:43:44.54
and then they will, you have more planes coming in,

2251
01:43:44.54 --> 01:43:47.74
coming down from the holding chute if you will

2252
01:43:47.74 --> 01:43:50.58
and they'll squeeze you in in the middle there

2253
01:43:52.10 --> 01:43:55.34
or they'll take you way down till one guy is early

2254
01:43:55.34 --> 01:43:58.82
and one guy's a little, you push over from those altitude

2255
01:43:58.82 --> 01:44:03.82
at an exact you're supposed to to the second timing

2256
01:44:04.70 --> 01:44:09.02
from the sack and some guys are a little bit early,

2257
01:44:09.02 --> 01:44:10.50
guys are a little bit late.

2258
01:44:10.50 --> 01:44:11.34
They can squeeze you in.

2259
01:44:11.34 --> 01:44:13.70
And it squeeze you in, in there

2260
01:44:13.70 --> 01:44:18.14
and then you get aboard the second time, we hope.

2261
01:44:18.14 --> 01:44:21.22
But at any rate, how do you bolter?

2262
01:44:21.22 --> 01:44:24.10
If you hook skip or you're high and laying along.

2263
01:44:24.10 --> 01:44:26.94
So I get in trouble because I boltered

2264
01:44:26.94 --> 01:44:31.26
and I'm not gonna do this two nights in a row

2265
01:44:31.26 --> 01:44:35.02
and it's almost unconscious, lower nose and close.

2266
01:44:36.22 --> 01:44:38.10
What, that's a move that you make to try

2267
01:44:38.10 --> 01:44:38.94
and make sure you're not high?

2268
01:44:38.94 --> 01:44:40.94
And that airplane comes down like a safe

2269
01:44:42.94 --> 01:44:45.94
and they also call a taxi one wire

2270
01:44:47.44 --> 01:44:51.50
in that you land before or you hook does well

2271
01:44:51.50 --> 01:44:54.78
before the one wire and you taxi into the one wire.

2272
01:44:56.44 --> 01:44:58.98
And thank heavens we're aboard

2273
01:44:58.98 --> 01:45:01.78
and that's enough for this for tonight and so forth.

2274
01:45:01.78 --> 01:45:06.30
So out of the next say 10 nights, I got,

2275
01:45:06.30 --> 01:45:11.30
well at the end let's say I got six come down in close.

2276
01:45:11.54 --> 01:45:14.06
So rule Gardner came to me and he said,

2277
01:45:14.06 --> 01:45:16.30
Tom in the passageway too,

2278
01:45:16.30 --> 01:45:19.10
that's another thing laid back in the passageway, Tom.

2279
01:45:19.10 --> 01:45:21.70
I don't want you to fly tomorrow

2280
01:45:21.70 --> 01:45:26.70
and you're not on the schedule because I don't like this.

2281
01:45:26.82 --> 01:45:29.06
And I don't want to make Pamela widow.

2282
01:45:30.86 --> 01:45:35.86
Oh, we had been married about 14 months at that point.

2283
01:45:37.10 --> 01:45:40.14
So he said, I want you to think about it.

2284
01:45:40.14 --> 01:45:41.54
This is not a punishment,

2285
01:45:41.54 --> 01:45:44.54
but I want you to think about lower nose and close.

2286
01:45:44.54 --> 01:45:46.66
And so if I fly that meat bolter touchdown,

2287
01:45:46.66 --> 01:45:51.66
that was an hundred of it, but that's the way he was.

2288
01:45:51.94 --> 01:45:54.62
Leadership again, very laid back.

2289
01:45:54.62 --> 01:45:58.94
I don't want you to fly rather than almost indicating

2290
01:45:58.94 --> 01:46:00.82
if you wanted to fly badly enough,

2291
01:46:00.82 --> 01:46:02.44
go to the schedules of office and Tom

2292
01:46:02.44 --> 01:46:04.42
to put yourself back on the schedule.

2293
01:46:04.42 --> 01:46:06.82
But no, do any of that.

2294
01:46:06.82 --> 01:46:07.90
Just.

2295
01:46:07.90 --> 01:46:11.02
So you bolter bolter one time?

2296
01:46:11.02 --> 01:46:15.38
No, like four out of six the week before

2297
01:46:15.38 --> 01:46:16.86
and that's why he did that.

2298
01:46:16.86 --> 01:46:17.70
God.

2299
01:46:17.70 --> 01:46:19.90
So once it got in your head.

2300
01:46:19.90 --> 01:46:21.22
And it's almost unconscious.

2301
01:46:21.22 --> 01:46:23.06
I think Dave can vouch to that.

2302
01:46:23.06 --> 01:46:26.98
You do it without really thinking about it.

2303
01:46:26.98 --> 01:46:27.82
Yeah.

2304
01:46:27.82 --> 01:46:30.06
You don't say, as soon as I get past the ramp,

2305
01:46:30.06 --> 01:46:32.22
I'm gonna lower the nose.

2306
01:46:32.22 --> 01:46:36.14
It's a bad habit that you don't know why you do it

2307
01:46:36.14 --> 01:46:37.26
and you do it.

2308
01:46:37.26 --> 01:46:41.46
So after you sit down for 24 hours and think,

2309
01:46:41.46 --> 01:46:43.38
that is dangerous, that is stupid

2310
01:46:43.38 --> 01:46:46.58
and you've seen pictures,

2311
01:46:46.58 --> 01:46:49.06
flight deck pictures of lower nose.

2312
01:46:49.06 --> 01:46:49.98
I'm not gonna do that anymore.

2313
01:46:49.98 --> 01:46:51.94
Is it a case of overcompensation, Dave?

2314
01:46:51.94 --> 01:46:54.52
Like subconscious overcompensation that you put,

2315
01:46:54.52 --> 01:46:57.46
you get over the ramp and you crank it down a little bit

2316
01:46:57.46 --> 01:46:58.42
because you want to be early

2317
01:46:58.42 --> 01:46:59.58
because you don't want to be long.

2318
01:46:59.58 --> 01:47:02.70
I think that feeling, the first time you bolter at night

2319
01:47:02.70 --> 01:47:04.30
is a really awful feeling

2320
01:47:04.30 --> 01:47:06.30
because all you want to do is land.

2321
01:47:06.30 --> 01:47:08.22
Like you just, you would trade anything you have

2322
01:47:08.22 --> 01:47:09.42
just to be on that flight deck.

2323
01:47:09.42 --> 01:47:11.58
And so you do all this work.

2324
01:47:11.58 --> 01:47:13.54
Tom was talking about the timing down to the second.

2325
01:47:13.54 --> 01:47:16.22
There's a lot of work to get you to three quarters of a mile.

2326
01:47:16.22 --> 01:47:18.02
It's a lot of work from the stack down

2327
01:47:18.02 --> 01:47:20.50
to the end of the runway or end of the ship.

2328
01:47:20.50 --> 01:47:22.78
And typically when you bolter,

2329
01:47:22.78 --> 01:47:25.42
it's because in the last probably three seconds

2330
01:47:25.42 --> 01:47:26.66
of a however long.

2331
01:47:26.66 --> 01:47:27.50
Or a less than a minute.

2332
01:47:27.50 --> 01:47:29.98
Yeah, or two seconds, you make one little error

2333
01:47:29.98 --> 01:47:32.30
in the last two seconds and it pushes you past the wires

2334
01:47:32.30 --> 01:47:34.02
by five feet.

2335
01:47:34.02 --> 01:47:35.22
And then you're back in the air again

2336
01:47:35.22 --> 01:47:37.14
and you don't want to be there.

2337
01:47:37.14 --> 01:47:40.14
And so I think in your mind, you say, when I get in close,

2338
01:47:40.14 --> 01:47:41.86
the term is called in close to at the ramp.

2339
01:47:41.86 --> 01:47:43.54
It's the last three or four seconds of flying.

2340
01:47:43.54 --> 01:47:45.94
I am not going to add power.

2341
01:47:45.94 --> 01:47:48.82
He mentioned something earlier about something

2342
01:47:48.82 --> 01:47:51.42
called the Burble, which is a real thing.

2343
01:47:51.42 --> 01:47:53.66
And the wind that goes over the flight deck,

2344
01:47:53.66 --> 01:47:55.26
especially in a conventional carrier

2345
01:47:55.26 --> 01:47:56.46
that has to make its own wind,

2346
01:47:56.46 --> 01:47:58.70
meaning it has to run the engines to get speed.

2347
01:47:58.70 --> 01:48:01.30
You have to have 30 knots of wind over the flight deck.

2348
01:48:01.30 --> 01:48:03.94
That Burble, the way the wind goes over the flight deck

2349
01:48:03.94 --> 01:48:05.70
and right at the end of the runway,

2350
01:48:05.70 --> 01:48:07.26
it curves down towards the water,

2351
01:48:07.26 --> 01:48:09.02
will literally pull your airplane down

2352
01:48:09.02 --> 01:48:10.62
just a couple of feet.

2353
01:48:10.62 --> 01:48:11.98
But if you add the Burble,

2354
01:48:11.98 --> 01:48:13.86
three or four feet, it's going to pull you down.

2355
01:48:13.86 --> 01:48:16.74
And that destroys part of your lift as well.

2356
01:48:16.74 --> 01:48:17.58
Absolutely.

2357
01:48:17.58 --> 01:48:20.10
And then that psychological piece of,

2358
01:48:20.10 --> 01:48:22.42
I am not going to go high.

2359
01:48:22.42 --> 01:48:24.22
That six or seven foot difference

2360
01:48:24.22 --> 01:48:26.22
will put your plane in the back of the ship

2361
01:48:26.22 --> 01:48:27.34
and literally blow it up.

2362
01:48:27.34 --> 01:48:28.42
That's the video he's talking about.

2363
01:48:28.42 --> 01:48:29.82
And I think the combination of those two

2364
01:48:29.82 --> 01:48:33.26
creates a really, really dangerous combination

2365
01:48:33.26 --> 01:48:34.46
of the psychology you talked about

2366
01:48:34.46 --> 01:48:36.78
and the actual aerodynamics of it.

2367
01:48:36.78 --> 01:48:40.06
And I would say just a high majority,

2368
01:48:40.06 --> 01:48:42.46
if not almost all of the mishaps around the ship

2369
01:48:42.46 --> 01:48:44.94
aren't really because of mechanical or engine problems,

2370
01:48:44.94 --> 01:48:46.14
it's because of that scenario.

2371
01:48:46.14 --> 01:48:48.10
And the LSO has probably went to the CO

2372
01:48:48.10 --> 01:48:50.38
and said, hey, you got to talk to this guy

2373
01:48:50.38 --> 01:48:52.34
because he's going to kill himself.

2374
01:48:52.34 --> 01:48:54.42
And that's when the skipper,

2375
01:48:54.42 --> 01:48:56.22
and I'm obviously putting words in his mouth

2376
01:48:56.22 --> 01:48:57.42
based on common experience.

2377
01:48:57.42 --> 01:48:58.54
I didn't talk about it specifically,

2378
01:48:58.54 --> 01:48:59.70
but it sounds like I'm hitting close

2379
01:48:59.70 --> 01:49:00.70
to the market that feeling.

2380
01:49:00.70 --> 01:49:01.54
Yes you are.

2381
01:49:01.54 --> 01:49:03.34
Yeah, that's what happens.

2382
01:49:03.34 --> 01:49:05.78
It's all very laid back too, as a matter of fact.

2383
01:49:05.78 --> 01:49:10.78
The LSO, he earlier that night said to you, Tom,

2384
01:49:11.62 --> 01:49:15.94
this is your third bolt of the Lorno's in close

2385
01:49:15.94 --> 01:49:19.02
in a row, this is not good, you got to work on this.

2386
01:49:19.02 --> 01:49:21.30
And then four hours later,

2387
01:49:21.30 --> 01:49:23.62
he came to me in the passenger way and said,

2388
01:49:23.62 --> 01:49:25.98
we're not going to do this, we got to change.

2389
01:49:27.02 --> 01:49:29.66
Dave, how many times did you bolt or bolt her?

2390
01:49:31.62 --> 01:49:34.50
I probably, so on my first cruise,

2391
01:49:34.50 --> 01:49:37.14
I had no bolters on my second cruise, I had one bolter.

2392
01:49:37.14 --> 01:49:38.58
Oh boy.

2393
01:49:38.58 --> 01:49:43.06
In training, when you're talking about CQ,

2394
01:49:43.06 --> 01:49:47.10
night CQ, I bet I had at least one,

2395
01:49:47.10 --> 01:49:48.82
if not two bolters at night.

2396
01:49:48.82 --> 01:49:49.98
What's night CQ?

2397
01:49:49.98 --> 01:49:52.26
No, I'm sorry, night carrier qualifications.

2398
01:49:52.26 --> 01:49:53.10
Got it.

2399
01:49:53.10 --> 01:49:53.94
The night.

2400
01:49:53.94 --> 01:49:54.78
Before you deploy.

2401
01:49:54.78 --> 01:49:56.02
Before you deploy, so the night CQ,

2402
01:49:57.38 --> 01:50:00.14
I had probably a relatively small handful.

2403
01:50:00.14 --> 01:50:02.18
Once you're on cruise and on the way,

2404
01:50:02.18 --> 01:50:03.70
it doesn't happen all that often,

2405
01:50:03.70 --> 01:50:06.50
but the thing that's crazy is probably some

2406
01:50:06.50 --> 01:50:09.38
of the worst flying you'll ever do is off the coast

2407
01:50:09.38 --> 01:50:11.54
of California, because it's overcast at 800 feet

2408
01:50:11.54 --> 01:50:13.42
all the time, even though it's beautiful

2409
01:50:13.42 --> 01:50:14.38
Southern California weather.

2410
01:50:14.38 --> 01:50:17.02
So it's pitch black underneath that overcast,

2411
01:50:17.02 --> 01:50:18.10
even if there is a full moon,

2412
01:50:18.10 --> 01:50:19.38
because there's a big cloud layer there,

2413
01:50:19.38 --> 01:50:22.70
and the Pacific Ocean likes to move around,

2414
01:50:22.70 --> 01:50:25.22
the ship moves around and it sucks, it's awful.

2415
01:50:26.74 --> 01:50:29.18
He flew a much harder plane to get aboard the ship

2416
01:50:29.18 --> 01:50:31.06
than I ever did, so what he did was harder.

2417
01:50:31.06 --> 01:50:32.98
You're talking about, you might have had four of these

2418
01:50:32.98 --> 01:50:35.46
in your career, you had four of them in six flights.

2419
01:50:35.46 --> 01:50:36.66
Nice flight nights.

2420
01:50:36.66 --> 01:50:37.50
Yeah.

2421
01:50:37.50 --> 01:50:38.94
That's enough to freak someone out first.

2422
01:50:38.94 --> 01:50:41.54
Yeah, I don't know.

2423
01:50:41.54 --> 01:50:44.82
The F-4 was an ancient airplane in a manner of speaking,

2424
01:50:44.82 --> 01:50:48.18
and the F-18 is a different breed of cat completely.

2425
01:50:48.18 --> 01:50:51.66
And I was told the F-18 is actually a fun airplane,

2426
01:50:51.66 --> 01:50:55.18
easy airplane to fly, and then you have to work

2427
01:50:55.18 --> 01:50:58.34
to get really good at it, but that's something else.

2428
01:50:58.34 --> 01:51:02.62
The F-4, first time I flew the F-4 with my instructor

2429
01:51:02.62 --> 01:51:04.54
and about cockpit, we went back,

2430
01:51:04.54 --> 01:51:08.26
you take off and go out over the Pacific, off Miramar,

2431
01:51:08.26 --> 01:51:11.14
and headed north, and he said,

2432
01:51:11.14 --> 01:51:13.46
you can level off here at 15,000,

2433
01:51:13.46 --> 01:51:15.66
or more or less, it didn't matter.

2434
01:51:16.58 --> 01:51:18.62
And I tried to level off, and I thought,

2435
01:51:18.62 --> 01:51:21.02
I can't even fly this thing straight and level.

2436
01:51:21.02 --> 01:51:26.02
But the F-4 was designed to be an unstable platform,

2437
01:51:27.14 --> 01:51:32.14
and then they put three axial axis stabilizing

2438
01:51:32.14 --> 01:51:36.34
devices in there, and the early models had a single switch,

2439
01:51:36.34 --> 01:51:38.58
and then they put three separate switches

2440
01:51:38.58 --> 01:51:41.38
for pitch rolling and yaw.

2441
01:51:41.38 --> 01:51:44.82
And a lot of guys, at the end, I would turn the roll off,

2442
01:51:44.82 --> 01:51:47.42
most guys did total roll off, but at any rate,

2443
01:51:47.42 --> 01:51:49.70
it was an unstable airplane, so if you touch the stick

2444
01:51:49.70 --> 01:51:52.42
a little bit, it'll do that, you touch the stick,

2445
01:51:52.42 --> 01:51:56.46
it turns off the stabilizing system.

2446
01:51:56.46 --> 01:51:58.78
When you touch the stick, there are micro switches

2447
01:51:58.78 --> 01:52:02.66
in the base of the physical hand grip,

2448
01:52:02.66 --> 01:52:05.74
and as soon as you touch it a little bit,

2449
01:52:05.74 --> 01:52:07.70
it turns off the roll stab.

2450
01:52:07.70 --> 01:52:10.30
You pull back just a little bit, turns off the,

2451
01:52:10.30 --> 01:52:15.18
just a little bit, so actually before you fly the airplane,

2452
01:52:15.18 --> 01:52:17.42
they'd want you to get familiar with the cockpit

2453
01:52:17.42 --> 01:52:19.90
and so forth, and they say to you,

2454
01:52:21.06 --> 01:52:23.54
realize that this system is there,

2455
01:52:23.54 --> 01:52:27.70
and if it's quiet, you can hear the micro switches click,

2456
01:52:27.70 --> 01:52:29.78
and you can't, but you just gotta touch them,

2457
01:52:29.78 --> 01:52:32.54
and you click it, click it, very faint,

2458
01:52:32.54 --> 01:52:35.10
but they're in there, and it turns off the roll stab,

2459
01:52:35.10 --> 01:52:38.54
so here you are your first time out with this thing,

2460
01:52:38.54 --> 01:52:41.90
and you touch it a little bit, and it turns off the micro stab,

2461
01:52:41.90 --> 01:52:46.02
the stabilization in pitch, and it does one of these,

2462
01:52:46.02 --> 01:52:48.66
and because you go the other way, and it keeps it off,

2463
01:52:48.66 --> 01:52:51.82
and so forth, and then you push it a little bit this way,

2464
01:52:51.82 --> 01:52:54.18
and it turns that off too, and then you go back,

2465
01:52:54.18 --> 01:52:55.62
and so forth.

2466
01:52:55.62 --> 01:52:58.66
And there, it only turns it off for half a second

2467
01:52:58.66 --> 01:53:00.62
or something like that, but if you hit it again,

2468
01:53:00.62 --> 01:53:01.46
it turns about.

2469
01:53:01.46 --> 01:53:02.30
If you over-correct the other side,

2470
01:53:02.30 --> 01:53:03.14
and it's just off.

2471
01:53:03.14 --> 01:53:05.62
So forth, and so forth, and so forth, yeah, so.

2472
01:53:05.62 --> 01:53:08.42
But the F-A-18 is a modern airplane,

2473
01:53:08.42 --> 01:53:12.22
the F-4 was just an airplane that Mr. McDonald said,

2474
01:53:12.22 --> 01:53:15.30
I want a monster, and I wanted to do this,

2475
01:53:15.30 --> 01:53:19.18
that, and the other thing, and if you have a problem

2476
01:53:19.18 --> 01:53:22.70
with it, it won't do that, add a system to do that,

2477
01:53:22.70 --> 01:53:25.14
and they did, and they kept on doing that,

2478
01:53:25.14 --> 01:53:28.34
and that's what you got, and you got a hell of an airplane,

2479
01:53:28.34 --> 01:53:32.98
but my favorite quote about the F-4 was a Marine,

2480
01:53:32.98 --> 01:53:35.90
and one of the books, as you might suspect,

2481
01:53:35.90 --> 01:53:38.06
I have airplane books and whatnot,

2482
01:53:38.06 --> 01:53:41.18
and he said, I flew the F-4 for three years,

2483
01:53:41.18 --> 01:53:42.46
and it never killed me.

2484
01:53:46.94 --> 01:53:50.98
So now you get to Vietnam, what's your mission?

2485
01:53:50.98 --> 01:53:52.06
What are you guys doing?

2486
01:53:52.06 --> 01:53:54.54
Ho Chi Minh Trail, Ho Chi Minh Trail, Ho Chi Minh Trail,

2487
01:53:54.54 --> 01:53:59.42
Latin Bar Cap, it was a bombing pause in the north,

2488
01:53:59.42 --> 01:54:04.42
and the only things were going up there were RA-5Cs

2489
01:54:04.46 --> 01:54:07.62
to look at whatever changes they made,

2490
01:54:07.62 --> 01:54:09.94
probably mostly in the airfields,

2491
01:54:09.94 --> 01:54:12.06
and also looking for SAM sites.

2492
01:54:13.98 --> 01:54:17.78
So you being a first cruise guy,

2493
01:54:17.78 --> 01:54:22.78
you were not gonna fly that escort until you did it.

2494
01:54:22.78 --> 01:54:25.74
I think that's a Navy tradition,

2495
01:54:25.74 --> 01:54:27.98
you can't do it until you do it.

2496
01:54:27.98 --> 01:54:32.38
So for the first three or four months of that cruise,

2497
01:54:32.38 --> 01:54:37.38
I didn't fly any Racky fighter escort up there,

2498
01:54:39.34 --> 01:54:42.90
and then basically what happens is,

2499
01:54:42.90 --> 01:54:45.78
and everybody I think is familiar with this,

2500
01:54:46.98 --> 01:54:49.58
Fred's sick, Tom, can you do this?

2501
01:54:49.58 --> 01:54:51.90
Yeah, I can do that.

2502
01:54:51.90 --> 01:54:55.66
So then you're the escort for the RA-5C,

2503
01:54:55.66 --> 01:55:00.38
and then you're on the regular schedule for that after that.

2504
01:55:00.38 --> 01:55:02.70
But that was the best flying I ever did in my life,

2505
01:55:02.70 --> 01:55:04.58
that keeping with him.

2506
01:55:04.58 --> 01:55:07.42
So what was one of those mission profiles look like?

2507
01:55:08.50 --> 01:55:13.50
Well, launch and point towards North Vietnam, the coast,

2508
01:55:15.94 --> 01:55:19.78
and they were always looking around,

2509
01:55:19.78 --> 01:55:22.94
so half the time they would see you on radar,

2510
01:55:22.94 --> 01:55:26.58
and you have receivers, and they're apparently,

2511
01:55:26.58 --> 01:55:28.38
the F-18 probably has better ones,

2512
01:55:28.38 --> 01:55:30.46
far better ones than we had.

2513
01:55:30.46 --> 01:55:32.90
And you see them, do do do do, looking at you

2514
01:55:32.90 --> 01:55:37.90
as the sweep goes by, and depressurize the cockpit,

2515
01:55:38.02 --> 01:55:43.02
and give yourself a little spacing on the RA-5C,

2516
01:55:43.74 --> 01:55:47.86
and he has promised that he will not go closer

2517
01:55:47.86 --> 01:55:51.02
than 1,000 feet to the undercast.

2518
01:55:51.02 --> 01:55:56.02
He will be above 4,000 feet of the, I'm sorry, the overcast.

2519
01:55:56.14 --> 01:55:58.62
He won't be that close to the undercast.

2520
01:55:58.62 --> 01:56:03.62
He will be 4,000 or 5,000 feet above the undercast.

2521
01:56:03.74 --> 01:56:06.14
He won't go faster, he won't use burner,

2522
01:56:06.14 --> 01:56:07.46
and about four other things,

2523
01:56:07.46 --> 01:56:09.30
and then when you get into it,

2524
01:56:09.30 --> 01:56:12.06
he does everything that he says he wouldn't do,

2525
01:56:12.06 --> 01:56:14.78
because he's shedding in his pants too.

2526
01:56:14.78 --> 01:56:17.86
Because they're looking at you, once you're in there,

2527
01:56:17.86 --> 01:56:20.18
they're looking at you with about three different,

2528
01:56:20.18 --> 01:56:21.94
you can hear the different tones,

2529
01:56:21.94 --> 01:56:23.66
different kinds of radars.

2530
01:56:23.66 --> 01:56:24.94
So what are they doing?

2531
01:56:24.94 --> 01:56:26.62
What's the RA-5C doing?

2532
01:56:26.62 --> 01:56:27.54
Taking pictures.

2533
01:56:29.14 --> 01:56:30.70
And you're just protecting it.

2534
01:56:30.70 --> 01:56:35.70
Right, because the MiG-21s shot down a lot of RA-5Cs,

2535
01:56:37.46 --> 01:56:40.22
and what they would do is they figured

2536
01:56:40.22 --> 01:56:41.90
maybe they're gonna do it today,

2537
01:56:41.90 --> 01:56:45.74
and they put one or two MiG-21s at very high altitude,

2538
01:56:45.74 --> 01:56:47.30
let's say above 35,000,

2539
01:56:47.30 --> 01:56:49.70
because they'd get more speed out of it,

2540
01:56:49.70 --> 01:56:54.22
because the MiG-21 would go 1.8 downhill, easy.

2541
01:56:54.22 --> 01:56:58.02
So they would wait until the RA-5C turned away

2542
01:56:58.02 --> 01:57:00.26
from where their loiter is up here,

2543
01:57:00.26 --> 01:57:04.62
and he's down 2,000 feet taking pictures,

2544
01:57:04.62 --> 01:57:07.10
and then come downhill behind him.

2545
01:57:07.10 --> 01:57:09.62
So your job was to stay away from him,

2546
01:57:09.62 --> 01:57:12.30
and always be looking back there.

2547
01:57:12.30 --> 01:57:14.38
This side too, because you never know,

2548
01:57:14.38 --> 01:57:16.42
but always back here,

2549
01:57:16.42 --> 01:57:18.02
and so stay away from him.

2550
01:57:18.02 --> 01:57:20.22
What people in the

2551
01:57:23.02 --> 01:57:26.22
YouTubes and things like that call Fatch Weave,

2552
01:57:26.22 --> 01:57:30.58
Mr. Commander Fatch invented that in 1944,

2553
01:57:30.58 --> 01:57:33.50
or something like that, and it's absolutely,

2554
01:57:33.50 --> 01:57:36.06
Air Force, they always write with each other,

2555
01:57:36.06 --> 01:57:39.66
and it's just useless and a waste of fuel.

2556
01:57:39.66 --> 01:57:42.94
We always stay one mile, minimum,

2557
01:57:42.94 --> 01:57:44.90
mile and a quarter is a little better,

2558
01:57:44.90 --> 01:57:47.38
so you can come back, and so forth.

2559
01:57:47.38 --> 01:57:51.34
So watch out for MiG-21.

2560
01:57:51.34 --> 01:57:54.50
I wanted to be head on with the MiG-21

2561
01:57:54.50 --> 01:57:57.66
because with the F-4 system,

2562
01:57:57.66 --> 01:58:00.54
well before that, off the coast of California,

2563
01:58:01.50 --> 01:58:03.46
nobody ever told me you could do this,

2564
01:58:03.46 --> 01:58:05.34
but I wondered, against F-8s,

2565
01:58:05.34 --> 01:58:10.26
I put the pepper, 35-mil pepper down the intake of an F-8,

2566
01:58:10.26 --> 01:58:11.26
and guess what happened?

2567
01:58:11.26 --> 01:58:13.02
Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

2568
01:58:13.02 --> 01:58:18.02
Then the Sidewinder Growl, which means it's easy.

2569
01:58:18.26 --> 01:58:20.66
Looking, just looking down the intake.

2570
01:58:20.66 --> 01:58:22.86
So I wanted to do that with the MiG-21,

2571
01:58:23.98 --> 01:58:25.50
but I never got the chance.

2572
01:58:26.74 --> 01:58:31.30
And I said to Jimmy, I said, when, my best friend,

2573
01:58:31.30 --> 01:58:36.30
I said, so that you can claim we got him with a sparrow,

2574
01:58:37.86 --> 01:58:41.22
we won't know which, because as soon as that Sidewinder

2575
01:58:41.22 --> 01:58:44.26
leaves, I'm gonna flip to, because you got the pepper on it,

2576
01:58:44.26 --> 01:58:47.30
I'm gonna flip to radar and pull the trigger a second time.

2577
01:58:47.30 --> 01:58:50.42
So I said, when that big guy sees,

2578
01:58:50.42 --> 01:58:52.30
maybe the Sidewinder won't guide,

2579
01:58:52.30 --> 01:58:54.38
maybe it'll miss him by 30 feet,

2580
01:58:54.38 --> 01:58:58.50
and then the kill radius is only 25 and stuff like that.

2581
01:58:58.50 --> 01:59:00.94
But when he sees that sparrow coming at him,

2582
01:59:00.94 --> 01:59:04.14
that monster sparrow, he's gonna shit in his pants.

2583
01:59:05.70 --> 01:59:09.22
So anyway, how'd it get into this?

2584
01:59:09.22 --> 01:59:11.18
Well, I was just asking what that mission profile was.

2585
01:59:11.18 --> 01:59:15.26
Yeah, so anyway, you follow him around basically

2586
01:59:15.26 --> 01:59:17.42
at high speed, and he always said he wasn't

2587
01:59:17.42 --> 01:59:20.06
gonna use a burner, and he had the same engines

2588
01:59:20.06 --> 01:59:23.66
that you have, and the J79 would put out,

2589
01:59:23.66 --> 01:59:26.14
ordinarily put out a smoke trail.

2590
01:59:26.14 --> 01:59:29.02
We got a mod in the F-4, late in the cruise,

2591
01:59:29.02 --> 01:59:32.78
that would stop that in a fuel additive,

2592
01:59:32.78 --> 01:59:36.18
but they had to put piping in to do that.

2593
01:59:36.18 --> 01:59:39.14
But at any rate, you look over at him,

2594
01:59:39.14 --> 01:59:42.14
and he's not smoking, that means he's a min burner

2595
01:59:42.14 --> 01:59:44.46
to get rid of the smoke, as soon as you did that,

2596
01:59:44.46 --> 01:59:45.90
the smoke went away.

2597
01:59:45.90 --> 01:59:50.62
So, and you look down, and the max low altitude speed

2598
01:59:50.62 --> 01:59:55.62
on the F-4, indicated airspeed, was I think like 740,

2599
01:59:55.62 --> 01:59:59.94
and you look at the indicated airspeed,

2600
01:59:59.94 --> 02:00:03.94
and he's not in burner, we're doing 790,

2601
02:00:03.94 --> 02:00:08.94
indicated relatively close to the ground,

2602
02:00:09.06 --> 02:00:13.06
and we're smoking along here, and then you come back,

2603
02:00:13.06 --> 02:00:14.46
and they know what you've been doing,

2604
02:00:14.46 --> 02:00:15.90
although it's a combat situation,

2605
02:00:15.90 --> 02:00:18.22
you're not gonna know what they were complaining,

2606
02:00:18.22 --> 02:00:21.82
but I have a picture of an F-4 coming aboard with,

2607
02:00:21.82 --> 02:00:24.50
and it's big dense in all three tanks,

2608
02:00:24.50 --> 02:00:26.66
because you've been up there,

2609
02:00:29.38 --> 02:00:31.86
if not at the mark, really close to it,

2610
02:00:31.86 --> 02:00:35.70
and the dynamic pressure dense the fronts of the tanks,

2611
02:00:35.70 --> 02:00:37.22
and maybe they don't do that anymore,

2612
02:00:37.22 --> 02:00:40.10
maybe put some sort of a reinforcement

2613
02:00:40.10 --> 02:00:41.34
on the front end of the tanks,

2614
02:00:41.34 --> 02:00:43.58
but those tanks were not reinforcing the noses,

2615
02:00:43.58 --> 02:00:47.86
and they were all dented from doing stuff like that.

2616
02:00:48.94 --> 02:00:50.66
This story is so cool for me,

2617
02:00:50.66 --> 02:00:54.06
because that's like just classic nail aviation,

2618
02:00:54.06 --> 02:00:55.78
what I always loved about flying with the Navy

2619
02:00:55.78 --> 02:00:59.06
in the Marine Corps was he's talking about that missile,

2620
02:00:59.06 --> 02:01:00.02
he was talking about in training,

2621
02:01:00.02 --> 02:01:02.18
like the book says you can only shoot the missile

2622
02:01:02.18 --> 02:01:04.10
from the back of an airplane, that's the rule,

2623
02:01:04.10 --> 02:01:06.06
and that's how it works, and they tell you,

2624
02:01:06.06 --> 02:01:07.82
and the coolest thing about flying with guys in the Navy,

2625
02:01:07.82 --> 02:01:09.30
they're like, I don't care what the book says,

2626
02:01:09.30 --> 02:01:10.90
I'm gonna go try this, see if it works,

2627
02:01:10.90 --> 02:01:13.86
and this missile, which is on paper and designed

2628
02:01:13.86 --> 02:01:15.74
to only shoot the back of a jet,

2629
02:01:15.74 --> 02:01:18.10
because the engines in the back, that's probably heat,

2630
02:01:18.10 --> 02:01:19.62
these guys figured out I could shoot this thing,

2631
02:01:19.62 --> 02:01:21.70
we call it four quarter in the nose,

2632
02:01:21.70 --> 02:01:24.70
and the best part about that is if you launch this at a MiG,

2633
02:01:24.70 --> 02:01:26.98
I guarantee you, he would do exactly what you described,

2634
02:01:26.98 --> 02:01:28.90
because nobody else would do that,

2635
02:01:28.90 --> 02:01:30.58
because the book says you can't do it,

2636
02:01:30.58 --> 02:01:32.54
so I just like listening to your stories of,

2637
02:01:32.54 --> 02:01:33.42
I don't care what the book says,

2638
02:01:33.42 --> 02:01:34.62
I'm gonna try this, see if it works,

2639
02:01:34.62 --> 02:01:38.86
and that big giant intake probably replicated a MiG-21's

2640
02:01:38.86 --> 02:01:40.98
big nose, that big giant engine right in the front

2641
02:01:40.98 --> 02:01:43.98
of the airplane, that's pretty cool thinking, I like that.

2642
02:01:43.98 --> 02:01:46.62
And he had a 37 millimeter gun too,

2643
02:01:46.62 --> 02:01:50.26
in both those airplanes, and you better not shoot

2644
02:01:50.26 --> 02:01:52.90
the pass too soon, because he's gonna be firing

2645
02:01:52.90 --> 02:01:56.50
that thing on a head on, no matter which one it is,

2646
02:01:56.50 --> 02:01:59.42
at you, and you got a piece of bulletproof glass

2647
02:01:59.42 --> 02:02:01.42
in the front of you, in the older airplanes,

2648
02:02:01.42 --> 02:02:05.06
the F-4 you did, so it shouldn't hit you in the face,

2649
02:02:05.06 --> 02:02:08.78
I guess, but he's liable to ruin your radar,

2650
02:02:08.78 --> 02:02:13.14
which could be a problem, if he gets close to you

2651
02:02:13.14 --> 02:02:15.54
with that head on, but as soon as you pull that trigger,

2652
02:02:15.54 --> 02:02:19.38
he's never saw anything like that in his life,

2653
02:02:19.38 --> 02:02:22.86
and he's been told that the F-4 has to get behind you,

2654
02:02:22.86 --> 02:02:25.62
so don't worry about it, and that's what I always,

2655
02:02:25.62 --> 02:02:27.62
and I said, Jimmy, you gonna be able to,

2656
02:02:27.62 --> 02:02:29.86
and we get that MiG with a sparrow,

2657
02:02:31.14 --> 02:02:36.14
because that's the, the radar operator's missile,

2658
02:02:36.94 --> 02:02:38.70
is a sparrow.

2659
02:02:38.70 --> 02:02:41.38
And so what was it that made those recon missions

2660
02:02:41.38 --> 02:02:43.82
so fun for you, just that you're up there

2661
02:02:43.82 --> 02:02:45.38
hauling ass around?

2662
02:02:46.74 --> 02:02:49.26
Well, this goes back to something I put in that deal,

2663
02:02:49.26 --> 02:02:51.86
and I heard the Chappy James say it the first time,

2664
02:02:51.86 --> 02:02:54.78
and I think it's common, but don't get in the airplane,

2665
02:02:54.78 --> 02:02:58.78
strap it on to you, and Chappy James was quite a guy,

2666
02:02:58.78 --> 02:03:02.66
and I talked to him once, once,

2667
02:03:02.66 --> 02:03:04.78
but you know who he was.

2668
02:03:04.78 --> 02:03:05.62
No, tell me about Chappy.

2669
02:03:05.62 --> 02:03:06.82
He was the black guy who was number two

2670
02:03:06.82 --> 02:03:09.86
to Robin Oles in Thailand, and Robin Oles got all

2671
02:03:09.86 --> 02:03:13.30
of publicity and all this, and Chappy James was

2672
02:03:13.30 --> 02:03:16.70
the quiet guy who kept his place and so forth,

2673
02:03:16.70 --> 02:03:19.34
but they made him a four star general.

2674
02:03:20.78 --> 02:03:24.42
He was, the night I talked to him,

2675
02:03:24.42 --> 02:03:27.26
he was the speaker at a dinner, and he had the place

2676
02:03:27.26 --> 02:03:31.18
in the palm of his hand, and then you figure,

2677
02:03:31.18 --> 02:03:34.26
he's probably winding up about now, and he said,

2678
02:03:34.26 --> 02:03:35.62
you've been such a great audience,

2679
02:03:35.62 --> 02:03:37.78
I'm gonna sing a song for you, and I thought,

2680
02:03:37.78 --> 02:03:40.42
oh, the poor man, he's gonna ruin everything.

2681
02:03:40.42 --> 02:03:42.42
He had it made here, and now he's gonna make

2682
02:03:42.42 --> 02:03:43.46
a fool of himself.

2683
02:03:43.46 --> 02:03:47.74
He sang Old Man River like a metropolitan opera.

2684
02:03:47.74 --> 02:03:50.90
He was really, really something.

2685
02:03:50.90 --> 02:03:55.90
So then he talked with the troops after everything was done.

2686
02:03:56.46 --> 02:04:01.38
He was, I mean, he had to strap it on, so that was,

2687
02:04:01.38 --> 02:04:04.66
first time, I felt that way, truly felt that way,

2688
02:04:04.66 --> 02:04:07.94
fly like the airplanes attached to you,

2689
02:04:07.94 --> 02:04:11.22
and the other way around,

2690
02:04:11.22 --> 02:04:15.74
because when he, you wanna say a mile or a mile

2691
02:04:15.74 --> 02:04:18.66
or a quarter of a beam, what happens if he turns into you?

2692
02:04:18.66 --> 02:04:21.62
Well, you go high, and you come up here this way,

2693
02:04:21.62 --> 02:04:24.18
and watch him, going around the bend,

2694
02:04:24.18 --> 02:04:25.34
and then you can go to the,

2695
02:04:25.34 --> 02:04:28.26
because you're coming down here, you're gonna gain energy,

2696
02:04:28.26 --> 02:04:30.46
so you can go to the outside if you figure

2697
02:04:30.46 --> 02:04:33.66
his next turn will be into you again.

2698
02:04:33.66 --> 02:04:36.42
Well, then you can go up without adding power,

2699
02:04:36.42 --> 02:04:39.10
because as you go,

2700
02:04:39.10 --> 02:04:43.06
no, that's wrong, but if he turns into you,

2701
02:04:43.06 --> 02:04:43.90
you can go high.

2702
02:04:43.90 --> 02:04:46.14
Would you fly with the same guy all the time?

2703
02:04:46.14 --> 02:04:46.98
In the backseat?

2704
02:04:46.98 --> 02:04:49.98
No, the plane that you were covering for.

2705
02:04:49.98 --> 02:04:51.58
No, you didn't even know his name.

2706
02:04:51.58 --> 02:04:52.42
No kidding.

2707
02:04:52.42 --> 02:04:55.62
Yeah, and they were all, because they are,

2708
02:04:55.62 --> 02:05:00.62
they lost a lot of young guys flying the RA5C early in its

2709
02:05:02.02 --> 02:05:07.02
career, they switched to mostly senior guys

2710
02:05:07.02 --> 02:05:10.34
with a lot of hours and a lot of traps.

2711
02:05:10.34 --> 02:05:13.34
They would lose them at the ramp.

2712
02:05:13.34 --> 02:05:17.26
So those guys were, maybe they were all commanders,

2713
02:05:17.26 --> 02:05:20.38
which is too old to be just an airplane driver

2714
02:05:20.38 --> 02:05:25.02
on a carrier, but because of the difficulty

2715
02:05:25.02 --> 02:05:29.18
getting the monster, that monster aboard, heavy,

2716
02:05:29.18 --> 02:05:32.98
their launch weight was a little over 80,000

2717
02:05:32.98 --> 02:05:37.42
on that thing, and the standard launch weight

2718
02:05:37.42 --> 02:05:41.50
that has come to pass more or less is around 60,000.

2719
02:05:41.50 --> 02:05:46.50
So 20,000 pounds heavier off, or getting aboard.

2720
02:05:46.90 --> 02:05:51.90
So they had senior guys doing that.

2721
02:05:52.22 --> 02:05:55.58
I think there was one guy who was a lieutenant commander,

2722
02:05:55.58 --> 02:06:00.42
but anyway, flying with him, flying,

2723
02:06:00.42 --> 02:06:04.94
I discovered I could fly like a bird, because

2724
02:06:04.94 --> 02:06:09.94
at that point in your training or in your experience level,

2725
02:06:10.82 --> 02:06:13.98
you start to get that good at it, and I thought,

2726
02:06:13.98 --> 02:06:16.94
holy smoke, I'm doing this, this way.

2727
02:06:16.94 --> 02:06:21.94
Even though at that point I had 1,000 hours of total flying,

2728
02:06:21.94 --> 02:06:24.14
maybe more than that, flying experience,

2729
02:06:24.14 --> 02:06:28.06
but it was something of a revelation to be able to

2730
02:06:28.06 --> 02:06:33.06
fly where you wanted to go and not be limited

2731
02:06:33.70 --> 02:06:38.18
by what the machine would do, especially with the F-4

2732
02:06:38.18 --> 02:06:41.06
when you had all that power, and especially

2733
02:06:41.06 --> 02:06:43.34
when you're about halfway through your fuel load,

2734
02:06:43.34 --> 02:06:48.14
you have a lot more power, because your weight is gone.

2735
02:06:48.14 --> 02:06:49.46
How long did the fuel last?

2736
02:06:49.46 --> 02:06:50.98
How long did you have?

2737
02:06:50.98 --> 02:06:54.42
Well, the cycle on consolation in combat zone was

2738
02:06:54.42 --> 02:06:58.22
two and a half.

2739
02:07:00.94 --> 02:07:03.38
They called it a two-hour cycle, but you wound up flying

2740
02:07:03.38 --> 02:07:06.46
two and a half hours, because they would launch everybody

2741
02:07:06.46 --> 02:07:09.22
and then they would recover you, so I think they launched

2742
02:07:09.22 --> 02:07:11.90
every two hours, I think that's how it worked.

2743
02:07:11.90 --> 02:07:14.18
You know, I never thought of it quite this way,

2744
02:07:14.18 --> 02:07:19.18
but anyway, my traps on combat zone were always about 2.6.

2745
02:07:19.18 --> 02:07:23.42
Did you guys get gas?

2746
02:07:24.90 --> 02:07:26.38
Only from time to time.

2747
02:07:26.38 --> 02:07:27.30
That's a long time.

2748
02:07:27.30 --> 02:07:29.98
Yeah, and the F-4 fuel gobbler,

2749
02:07:29.98 --> 02:07:34.30
and you were always, always sweating fuel,

2750
02:07:34.30 --> 02:07:36.34
always sweating fuel.

2751
02:07:36.34 --> 02:07:38.50
The cycle time, they measure the cycle time

2752
02:07:38.50 --> 02:07:39.98
when you're talking about on an aircraft carrier,

2753
02:07:39.98 --> 02:07:42.74
in the cycle time is launch to launch,

2754
02:07:42.74 --> 02:07:45.22
so if it's two hours, that means a launch happens,

2755
02:07:45.22 --> 02:07:47.46
and two hours later, the launch happens.

2756
02:07:47.46 --> 02:07:50.66
What's bad about that is if you're on a two-hour cycle,

2757
02:07:50.66 --> 02:07:52.90
when you launch, you'll be the first one to go

2758
02:07:52.90 --> 02:07:55.98
in your Phantom, and then two hours later,

2759
02:07:55.98 --> 02:07:58.94
the next launch goes, you have to wait for all those

2760
02:07:58.94 --> 02:08:01.26
airplanes to get launched before you recover,

2761
02:08:01.26 --> 02:08:04.02
so that two hours is two hours from takeoff to takeoff,

2762
02:08:04.02 --> 02:08:05.86
you have to wait for everybody else on the next launch

2763
02:08:05.86 --> 02:08:07.94
to takeoff before you can land, so that two becomes

2764
02:08:07.94 --> 02:08:10.78
two and a half, and 30 minutes, and actually 30 minutes

2765
02:08:10.78 --> 02:08:12.38
is a lot of time to manage your gas.

2766
02:08:12.38 --> 02:08:14.02
You burn 100 pounds a minute.

2767
02:08:14.02 --> 02:08:14.98
Yeah, that's a lot.

2768
02:08:14.98 --> 02:08:16.34
100 pounds a minute?

2769
02:08:16.34 --> 02:08:19.50
Yeah, that's 6,000 pounds an hour.

2770
02:08:19.50 --> 02:08:21.06
6,000 pounds an hour, yeah.

2771
02:08:22.34 --> 02:08:24.58
How about hitting the Ho Chi Minh Trail

2772
02:08:24.58 --> 02:08:26.22
doing those bombing runs?

2773
02:08:26.22 --> 02:08:30.58
Well, you always had a, well, what you do is,

2774
02:08:30.58 --> 02:08:33.90
no, I had your flight later, I was always the one,

2775
02:08:33.90 --> 02:08:38.90
your flight later, would call, I think it was a piston engine

2776
02:08:40.66 --> 02:08:44.62
Lockheed Constellation that was out over the water south,

2777
02:08:44.62 --> 02:08:48.02
and he would ask you what you were and what your ordinance was,

2778
02:08:48.02 --> 02:08:51.10
and he'd come back and say, your fact is gonna be

2779
02:08:51.10 --> 02:08:55.78
camera 2-2, and he is currently at the Lusensow,

2780
02:08:55.78 --> 02:09:00.22
the Lusensow-Tacan, and he will meet you at the Lusensow

2781
02:09:00.22 --> 02:09:05.10
and Lusensow of that Tacan, and which would be somewhere

2782
02:09:05.10 --> 02:09:10.10
in northern Laos, and he'll be there in 12 minutes.

2783
02:09:12.30 --> 02:09:14.30
He's on route right now.

2784
02:09:14.30 --> 02:09:19.30
So you would go there, and excuse me,

2785
02:09:19.66 --> 02:09:23.70
and you'd go there, and we'll wait a couple of minutes

2786
02:09:23.70 --> 02:09:25.94
because if you called him up early, he'd say,

2787
02:09:25.94 --> 02:09:30.94
I'm going as fast as I can, and so, so anyway,

2788
02:09:31.82 --> 02:09:34.34
then he'd call you up and say, I'm in your area now,

2789
02:09:34.34 --> 02:09:39.34
here's what we're gonna do, and he had what they called logs,

2790
02:09:39.90 --> 02:09:43.94
they were pieces of wood that were four inches square

2791
02:09:43.94 --> 02:09:46.50
and about two feet long, and had holes drilled

2792
02:09:46.50 --> 02:09:51.50
longitudinally in there, and they had Willie Pete inside,

2793
02:09:52.70 --> 02:09:56.66
and maybe they had a fuse or something, I don't remember,

2794
02:09:56.66 --> 02:09:59.78
that light that, and he would fly over the spot more or less

2795
02:09:59.78 --> 02:10:02.26
where he wanted you to go, and he would drop it out,

2796
02:10:02.26 --> 02:10:04.70
a trap door that he had in the bottom of the airplane.

2797
02:10:04.70 --> 02:10:05.70
Is this true?

2798
02:10:05.70 --> 02:10:09.66
Yeah, and then he would go drop a second one,

2799
02:10:09.66 --> 02:10:11.90
and he said, do you have my two markers,

2800
02:10:11.90 --> 02:10:13.38
and you'd say, yeah, okay, and he said,

2801
02:10:13.38 --> 02:10:17.18
now, they are northeast and southwest,

2802
02:10:17.18 --> 02:10:20.50
so remember they're northeast, they're not north

2803
02:10:20.50 --> 02:10:22.46
and south, they're northeast and southwest,

2804
02:10:22.46 --> 02:10:27.46
and what you want is on a triangle pointed to the north,

2805
02:10:29.62 --> 02:10:32.74
but to the northeast, and sort of,

2806
02:10:32.74 --> 02:10:35.22
and there's a crossroads there, can you see the crossroads,

2807
02:10:35.22 --> 02:10:37.74
and sometimes you could on a moonlit night.

2808
02:10:37.74 --> 02:10:40.22
He said, okay, now, not the crossroads, but,

2809
02:10:40.22 --> 02:10:43.62
and this is, this is really what they were doing.

2810
02:10:43.62 --> 02:10:44.46
That's what you're doing, yeah.

2811
02:10:44.46 --> 02:10:46.42
And he'd say, I drop another one,

2812
02:10:46.42 --> 02:10:48.10
but we don't want to alert them,

2813
02:10:48.10 --> 02:10:50.38
because the trucks are all parked right now,

2814
02:10:50.38 --> 02:10:53.54
but there's a grove of heavy trees, can you see those?

2815
02:10:53.54 --> 02:10:54.98
No, you can't.

2816
02:10:54.98 --> 02:10:58.42
I would always turn my lights out after you get off the ship,

2817
02:10:58.42 --> 02:11:02.82
and how would you put it, comfortable for a couple of minutes,

2818
02:11:02.82 --> 02:11:05.14
I'd turn everything off, because I had a good,

2819
02:11:05.14 --> 02:11:10.14
best RO in the back, and of course you can hear,

2820
02:11:10.26 --> 02:11:12.06
something's amiss in the airplane.

2821
02:11:12.06 --> 02:11:15.22
What's that ticking, what's that thumping, whatever,

2822
02:11:15.22 --> 02:11:17.46
the engines don't sound right,

2823
02:11:17.46 --> 02:11:20.30
you can hear all that even with your helmet on,

2824
02:11:20.30 --> 02:11:23.82
so I figured, and warning light panels for galore,

2825
02:11:23.82 --> 02:11:28.54
so I figured, turn it out, the human eye takes,

2826
02:11:28.54 --> 02:11:30.74
you probably know this, it takes about 30,

2827
02:11:30.74 --> 02:11:33.74
yeah, half an hour, the same length of time

2828
02:11:33.74 --> 02:11:37.46
takes the sun to set, so after half an hour,

2829
02:11:37.46 --> 02:11:39.02
you can see everything on the ground,

2830
02:11:39.02 --> 02:11:41.54
and the facts talking about that, grove of trees,

2831
02:11:41.54 --> 02:11:43.14
yeah, I can see what you're talking about,

2832
02:11:43.14 --> 02:11:45.26
I can see where those roads are,

2833
02:11:45.26 --> 02:11:48.46
I only started doing that after about two or three months,

2834
02:11:48.46 --> 02:11:51.06
because initially you don't know what you're doing.

2835
02:11:51.06 --> 02:11:54.78
But, turn the lights out,

2836
02:11:54.78 --> 02:11:58.66
and turn the panel lights all the way down,

2837
02:11:58.66 --> 02:11:59.94
because the warning panels,

2838
02:11:59.94 --> 02:12:03.02
any warning lights, low fuel, or anything like that,

2839
02:12:03.02 --> 02:12:07.22
that doesn't turn down, as you might figure.

2840
02:12:07.22 --> 02:12:09.38
So I figured, with a good guy in the back,

2841
02:12:10.90 --> 02:12:13.50
he'll let me know, so then you're right.

2842
02:12:13.50 --> 02:12:16.30
And then you're almost daylight,

2843
02:12:16.30 --> 02:12:19.66
when you eyes get truly acclimated,

2844
02:12:19.66 --> 02:12:21.06
and you see everything on the ground,

2845
02:12:21.06 --> 02:12:24.42
even if it's just the least little moon, but just stars,

2846
02:12:24.42 --> 02:12:27.34
you can see stuff on the ground, so then you're right.

2847
02:12:27.34 --> 02:12:28.18
That's what happens.

2848
02:12:28.18 --> 02:12:29.94
Were you always running nighttime missions?

2849
02:12:29.94 --> 02:12:33.34
99, 95, 99%

2850
02:12:33.34 --> 02:12:35.90
What would cause a daytime mission?

2851
02:12:35.90 --> 02:12:39.14
New on Yankee Station, the first day,

2852
02:12:39.14 --> 02:12:44.14
maybe day two days, days, but then after that, all nights,

2853
02:12:44.82 --> 02:12:49.62
and you'd be on Yankee Station for 31, 32 days.

2854
02:12:49.62 --> 02:12:51.46
Well, what's Yankee Station, what is it?

2855
02:12:51.46 --> 02:12:54.82
Northern Gulf of Tonkin, Northern Gulf.

2856
02:12:54.82 --> 02:12:56.98
Initially they had a second carrier,

2857
02:12:56.98 --> 02:12:59.90
they called Dixie Station, off of South Vietnam,

2858
02:12:59.90 --> 02:13:01.46
and they stopped that.

2859
02:13:01.46 --> 02:13:05.98
And they would have two carriers up North,

2860
02:13:05.98 --> 02:13:08.14
excuse me, on Yankee Station.

2861
02:13:09.30 --> 02:13:11.74
But anyway, you turn lights out

2862
02:13:11.74 --> 02:13:13.38
and you could see everything at night,

2863
02:13:13.38 --> 02:13:16.10
and the guy says, can you see the trees?

2864
02:13:16.10 --> 02:13:18.46
And Skipper wouldn't be able to see him,

2865
02:13:18.46 --> 02:13:22.10
because he's got older eyeballs than me,

2866
02:13:22.10 --> 02:13:24.22
and he didn't turn his lights out,

2867
02:13:24.22 --> 02:13:26.94
or turn them out completely, that's what I would do.

2868
02:13:26.94 --> 02:13:29.38
And he had good RO too,

2869
02:13:29.38 --> 02:13:30.86
and he stole my good RO.

2870
02:13:30.86 --> 02:13:34.02
When his RO got taken by the Admiral

2871
02:13:35.42 --> 02:13:39.06
to be part of his staff, then he took my RO,

2872
02:13:39.06 --> 02:13:40.90
and then I had a teenager,

2873
02:13:40.90 --> 02:13:43.18
who didn't know what he was doing,

2874
02:13:43.18 --> 02:13:45.26
he was right out of the Naval Academy.

2875
02:13:45.26 --> 02:13:50.10
Anyway, so he'd give you those coordinates,

2876
02:13:50.10 --> 02:13:51.94
and he said, can you see the trees,

2877
02:13:51.94 --> 02:13:55.54
that is just south of where that intersection is?

2878
02:13:55.54 --> 02:13:57.58
And he said, yeah, anywhere in those trees,

2879
02:13:57.58 --> 02:14:01.70
because it's full of trucks there, and so forth.

2880
02:14:01.70 --> 02:14:03.54
Sometimes you'd get there,

2881
02:14:03.54 --> 02:14:07.54
and you'd see headlights, but rarely, rarely.

2882
02:14:07.54 --> 02:14:09.18
And as soon as they really hear you,

2883
02:14:09.18 --> 02:14:11.54
they would run back to the truck and turn the lights off,

2884
02:14:11.54 --> 02:14:15.50
or turn the engines off, I guess, at any rate,

2885
02:14:15.50 --> 02:14:17.02
and then you'd do that.

2886
02:14:17.02 --> 02:14:20.46
But see that thing there that you read early on,

2887
02:14:20.46 --> 02:14:24.22
that was, you know, when Lyndon Johnson

2888
02:14:24.22 --> 02:14:28.30
had his bombing pause in North Vietnam,

2889
02:14:28.30 --> 02:14:31.34
the North Vietnamese took all the guns

2890
02:14:31.34 --> 02:14:33.22
that used to be in North Vietnam,

2891
02:14:33.22 --> 02:14:34.70
and put them over in the Lows

2892
02:14:34.70 --> 02:14:38.02
to guard the Ho Chi Minh Trail over there.

2893
02:14:38.02 --> 02:14:43.02
So, where was I?

2894
02:14:43.02 --> 02:14:45.34
The guns and so forth, and...

2895
02:14:48.34 --> 02:14:50.86
Well, how often were you moving to,

2896
02:14:50.86 --> 02:14:54.50
like you mentioned the anti-aircraft,

2897
02:14:54.50 --> 02:14:56.46
the flak that you're flying by,

2898
02:14:56.46 --> 02:14:57.42
the surface-dairy missiles,

2899
02:14:57.42 --> 02:14:59.82
how often did you run into that?

2900
02:14:59.82 --> 02:15:00.90
Was that every mission?

2901
02:15:00.90 --> 02:15:03.10
Every time, every time.

2902
02:15:03.10 --> 02:15:05.66
But they were cool about that, you see,

2903
02:15:05.66 --> 02:15:06.58
you'd get there.

2904
02:15:06.58 --> 02:15:07.42
Who was cool about that?

2905
02:15:07.42 --> 02:15:09.38
The gunners on the ground.

2906
02:15:09.38 --> 02:15:10.34
The enemy gunners?

2907
02:15:10.34 --> 02:15:11.18
Yeah.

2908
02:15:11.18 --> 02:15:12.02
In what way?

2909
02:15:12.02 --> 02:15:13.90
Well, they'd know you were there,

2910
02:15:13.90 --> 02:15:15.30
because they could hear you.

2911
02:15:15.30 --> 02:15:20.30
And in your orbiting,

2912
02:15:20.30 --> 02:15:21.86
what I would do immediately,

2913
02:15:21.86 --> 02:15:23.30
as soon as we get there,

2914
02:15:23.30 --> 02:15:25.42
I'd separate an altitude,

2915
02:15:25.42 --> 02:15:29.06
I'd go a thousand higher on whoever was,

2916
02:15:29.06 --> 02:15:30.78
usually a rural gardener,

2917
02:15:30.78 --> 02:15:32.62
but I'd go a thousand higher,

2918
02:15:32.62 --> 02:15:34.94
and I'd cut across and turn,

2919
02:15:34.94 --> 02:15:38.78
every naval aviator is a left-hand turn expert.

2920
02:15:38.78 --> 02:15:39.66
They're all turned left.

2921
02:15:39.66 --> 02:15:42.42
In fact, one time I met a guy in Philadelphia

2922
02:15:42.42 --> 02:15:43.82
who had the same dog as I did,

2923
02:15:43.82 --> 02:15:44.94
and I started talking with him,

2924
02:15:44.94 --> 02:15:47.18
and then I saw him a second or a third time.

2925
02:15:47.18 --> 02:15:49.18
He said, what'd you do before you did the ad business?

2926
02:15:49.18 --> 02:15:50.62
He said I was a naval aviator.

2927
02:15:50.62 --> 02:15:52.26
I said, son of a gun, so was I.

2928
02:15:52.26 --> 02:15:53.46
How about that?

2929
02:15:53.46 --> 02:15:55.78
So at any rate, in that office,

2930
02:15:55.78 --> 02:15:57.38
it was street level,

2931
02:15:57.38 --> 02:15:59.90
I had an old IBM computer,

2932
02:15:59.90 --> 02:16:04.02
and I had the Microsoft Flight Simulator

2933
02:16:04.02 --> 02:16:08.26
early on, a version of that on that computer.

2934
02:16:08.26 --> 02:16:11.10
I said, come inside and look at this thing.

2935
02:16:11.10 --> 02:16:12.86
Anyway, I took it off,

2936
02:16:12.86 --> 02:16:15.02
and they'd take off, and I turned right,

2937
02:16:15.02 --> 02:16:17.42
and he said, what the hell kind of a naval aviator are you?

2938
02:16:17.42 --> 02:16:19.34
I turned right.

2939
02:16:19.34 --> 02:16:20.34
And it sims.

2940
02:16:20.34 --> 02:16:23.74
I can't remember, anyway, it doesn't matter.

2941
02:16:23.74 --> 02:16:26.18
Sims, nice guy, nice guy.

2942
02:16:26.18 --> 02:16:28.30
At any rate, I would turn,

2943
02:16:28.30 --> 02:16:30.30
I would orbit to the right,

2944
02:16:30.30 --> 02:16:33.74
and I knew that he was gonna roll in from 1-8.

2945
02:16:33.74 --> 02:16:38.22
I would roll in anywhere at the top of the quadrant

2946
02:16:39.70 --> 02:16:42.62
of the compass rows.

2947
02:16:42.62 --> 02:16:45.66
So what made what the gunners do cool?

2948
02:16:45.66 --> 02:16:46.50
You said the gunners are cool.

2949
02:16:46.50 --> 02:16:47.34
Cool.

2950
02:16:47.34 --> 02:16:49.74
You make yourself present,

2951
02:16:49.74 --> 02:16:52.42
because you're making all that noise right over here,

2952
02:16:52.42 --> 02:16:53.58
over the crossroads,

2953
02:16:53.58 --> 02:16:55.22
and they know, the gunners all know,

2954
02:16:55.22 --> 02:16:57.02
as the trucks are over there,

2955
02:16:57.02 --> 02:16:57.86
and they know that,

2956
02:16:57.86 --> 02:16:59.70
and they know that you know that,

2957
02:16:59.70 --> 02:17:02.34
because they can hear the fact flying around too.

2958
02:17:02.34 --> 02:17:06.90
So they would wait until you roll in, until you commit.

2959
02:17:06.90 --> 02:17:09.66
The problem is, they had to get a handle on you

2960
02:17:09.66 --> 02:17:10.66
when you start down,

2961
02:17:10.66 --> 02:17:14.38
because they also know, I presume that they knew,

2962
02:17:14.38 --> 02:17:15.70
that you're gonna pull a powered idle,

2963
02:17:15.70 --> 02:17:17.30
and your engines get very quiet,

2964
02:17:17.30 --> 02:17:19.34
as soon as you do that.

2965
02:17:19.34 --> 02:17:22.86
So if they didn't have a bead on you, at that point,

2966
02:17:22.86 --> 02:17:24.10
I'm convinced too,

2967
02:17:24.10 --> 02:17:29.10
that they used a simple auditory way to track you.

2968
02:17:31.82 --> 02:17:35.38
I think my idea is that,

2969
02:17:35.38 --> 02:17:38.78
if you took a bunch of paper towel tubes,

2970
02:17:38.78 --> 02:17:40.18
and put tape around them,

2971
02:17:40.18 --> 02:17:42.58
and put a microphone behind them,

2972
02:17:42.58 --> 02:17:47.26
and then you put that on the mount of a gun,

2973
02:17:47.26 --> 02:17:49.98
where the barrel got overheated and it warped,

2974
02:17:49.98 --> 02:17:54.38
so we got this gun mount over here, we don't use it,

2975
02:17:54.38 --> 02:17:59.38
put that auditory search finder thing on the gun,

2976
02:18:00.10 --> 02:18:02.06
because as soon as I turn it over there,

2977
02:18:02.06 --> 02:18:02.90
and I can hear it,

2978
02:18:02.90 --> 02:18:04.62
I got headphones on, and I can hear,

2979
02:18:04.62 --> 02:18:08.06
there he is, oh, I lost him, no, I got him back again.

2980
02:18:08.06 --> 02:18:09.66
But the point here is that,

2981
02:18:09.66 --> 02:18:13.70
the azimuth and elevation on that auditory device,

2982
02:18:13.70 --> 02:18:15.54
if you have a simple system,

2983
02:18:15.54 --> 02:18:19.82
you can all the five guys having 57 millimeter,

2984
02:18:19.82 --> 02:18:22.18
or even 85 millimeter pieces around here,

2985
02:18:22.18 --> 02:18:23.82
they know where you are,

2986
02:18:23.82 --> 02:18:27.38
because they can read what he is tracking you

2987
02:18:27.38 --> 02:18:29.54
in an auditory fashion.

2988
02:18:29.54 --> 02:18:33.14
So they wouldn't open up sometimes,

2989
02:18:33.14 --> 02:18:36.46
until you release,

2990
02:18:36.46 --> 02:18:40.46
pull, and add power, and as soon as you did that,

2991
02:18:41.70 --> 02:18:46.10
yeah, that's shit going by from the back,

2992
02:18:46.10 --> 02:18:49.26
and most of it right there,

2993
02:18:49.26 --> 02:18:52.26
because they had time to know where you were,

2994
02:18:52.26 --> 02:18:54.62
and they could hear you in orbit,

2995
02:18:54.62 --> 02:18:56.90
and now this guy was over here,

2996
02:18:56.90 --> 02:19:00.26
and suddenly he got silent, that means he's in the dive,

2997
02:19:00.26 --> 02:19:02.38
so that means he's gonna be over here,

2998
02:19:02.38 --> 02:19:04.94
and turn their guns around,

2999
02:19:04.94 --> 02:19:08.14
more over the guy with the auditory,

3000
02:19:08.14 --> 02:19:11.66
have a dozen paper towel tubes taped together,

3001
02:19:11.66 --> 02:19:15.98
he can hear you, even if you got your engines at idle,

3002
02:19:15.98 --> 02:19:18.06
I think, that's my private theory,

3003
02:19:18.06 --> 02:19:19.90
I don't know if that's true or not,

3004
02:19:19.90 --> 02:19:21.94
but anyway, that's when they would open up on you,

3005
02:19:21.94 --> 02:19:25.02
and yes, every night, no question, every night,

3006
02:19:25.02 --> 02:19:29.06
anytime you were there, they would blast away,

3007
02:19:30.34 --> 02:19:31.50
and...

3008
02:19:31.50 --> 02:19:34.86
Did you guys lose any aircraft while you were on deployment?

3009
02:19:34.86 --> 02:19:38.62
Not my squadron, no, the ship lost,

3010
02:19:38.62 --> 02:19:41.46
I don't know, four or five, maybe more,

3011
02:19:41.46 --> 02:19:44.18
A7s, no A6s,

3012
02:19:46.06 --> 02:19:49.54
A6 guys, I think, were pretty cagey,

3013
02:19:49.54 --> 02:19:54.26
A7 drivers, they all tended to be, seemed to me,

3014
02:19:54.26 --> 02:19:56.82
younger guys, in the wardrobes, sitting there,

3015
02:19:56.82 --> 02:19:57.66
with the guy, I said,

3016
02:19:57.66 --> 02:19:59.46
man, I had a hell of a time tonight,

3017
02:19:59.46 --> 02:20:01.38
I was mixing it up with these guys,

3018
02:20:01.38 --> 02:20:04.82
they had a 57 millimeter in a cave on the side of a hill,

3019
02:20:04.82 --> 02:20:06.02
I don't know how they got it up there,

3020
02:20:06.02 --> 02:20:07.90
but I made it, I came back around

3021
02:20:07.90 --> 02:20:10.10
and gave them another load of 20 millimeter,

3022
02:20:10.10 --> 02:20:12.38
I thought, really, I said, you know,

3023
02:20:12.38 --> 02:20:14.58
you're sitting that far across the wardrobes table,

3024
02:20:14.58 --> 02:20:17.58
I said, do you realize what the aim point is?

3025
02:20:17.58 --> 02:20:19.10
Oh, it's the airplane, I said, no, no, no,

3026
02:20:19.10 --> 02:20:22.02
the aim point's right between your eyes, you're nuts,

3027
02:20:22.02 --> 02:20:25.26
put a 500 pound bomb into that hole,

3028
02:20:25.26 --> 02:20:28.06
if you, any good as a bomber, you can do that,

3029
02:20:28.06 --> 02:20:31.98
put a bomb into his cave, that's the end of that gun,

3030
02:20:31.98 --> 02:20:34.34
no, it was more fun, I went around a third time,

3031
02:20:34.34 --> 02:20:37.98
and I said, you're crazy, he's gonna shoot you down,

3032
02:20:37.98 --> 02:20:39.54
you're gonna feel really stupid,

3033
02:20:39.54 --> 02:20:41.14
you throw away your weapons,

3034
02:20:41.14 --> 02:20:43.38
is what you do when you get shot down,

3035
02:20:43.38 --> 02:20:47.02
you have a responsibility to, in your book,

3036
02:20:47.02 --> 02:20:51.86
you talk about things that are worth it

3037
02:20:51.86 --> 02:20:53.10
and things that are not worth it,

3038
02:20:53.10 --> 02:20:55.34
and I have to tell anybody who's willing to,

3039
02:20:55.34 --> 02:20:58.06
including my old skipper or somebody like that,

3040
02:20:58.06 --> 02:21:00.78
I said, I have a favorite switch position

3041
02:21:00.78 --> 02:21:04.54
down by your left knee in the F4, it's an all,

3042
02:21:04.54 --> 02:21:06.70
it does all the bombs, doesn't,

3043
02:21:06.70 --> 02:21:10.58
the missiles, the missiles stay, but the bombs,

3044
02:21:10.58 --> 02:21:13.50
you have singles pairs, doubles, cluster,

3045
02:21:14.58 --> 02:21:19.22
all, and then all, flip, all,

3046
02:21:19.22 --> 02:21:21.98
this is bad here tonight, I don't wanna be here,

3047
02:21:21.98 --> 02:21:26.34
I'll be back tomorrow, but for tonight, all,

3048
02:21:26.34 --> 02:21:27.74
see if you can eat this load,

3049
02:21:27.74 --> 02:21:30.22
there's only six of them for seven, six,

3050
02:21:30.22 --> 02:21:31.58
what, six, 500 pounders?

3051
02:21:31.58 --> 02:21:36.58
Yeah, that was our standard bomb load, six, 500 pounders.

3052
02:21:37.14 --> 02:21:39.38
As the deployment went on,

3053
02:21:39.38 --> 02:21:41.98
and you're going out facing this every night,

3054
02:21:41.98 --> 02:21:43.42
night after night, is it every night,

3055
02:21:43.42 --> 02:21:44.26
you flying every night?

3056
02:21:44.26 --> 02:21:47.54
Yeah, and when you were in the Gulf, you flew every night.

3057
02:21:48.90 --> 02:21:51.06
How's this wearing on you mentally?

3058
02:21:53.34 --> 02:21:56.94
Not bad, I think at that age, you're in your late 20s,

3059
02:21:56.94 --> 02:21:59.46
I was in my late 20s, no, not a big deal,

3060
02:21:59.46 --> 02:22:03.78
except that air conditioning on some ships

3061
02:22:03.78 --> 02:22:06.10
was not very good, and Constellation was one of them,

3062
02:22:06.10 --> 02:22:08.62
the flight tag, or the O3 level.

3063
02:22:08.62 --> 02:22:10.10
Who did it to a Navy guy,

3064
02:22:10.10 --> 02:22:12.14
where that air conditioning pisses us off

3065
02:22:12.14 --> 02:22:13.22
all the time on a ship?

3066
02:22:13.22 --> 02:22:15.58
Well, how about you just had good ventilation,

3067
02:22:15.58 --> 02:22:20.46
you know, you have 85 degree air outside,

3068
02:22:20.46 --> 02:22:22.66
put 85 degree air in this room.

3069
02:22:22.66 --> 02:22:24.10
That would be nice.

3070
02:22:24.10 --> 02:22:29.70
You know, and my state room was on the O3 level,

3071
02:22:29.70 --> 02:22:33.10
the O4 level is the flight, yeah.

3072
02:22:33.10 --> 02:22:35.66
So there are places in the ship

3073
02:22:35.66 --> 02:22:38.78
where the air conditioning really did work beautifully,

3074
02:22:38.78 --> 02:22:44.58
but we got visited by ABC or CBS News or something like that,

3075
02:22:44.58 --> 02:22:45.70
and they were on Hancock,

3076
02:22:45.70 --> 02:22:48.86
which was in the Gulf at the same time at that time,

3077
02:22:48.86 --> 02:22:50.46
and one of these guys said to me,

3078
02:22:50.46 --> 02:22:53.22
boy, we could see this ship on the horizon,

3079
02:22:53.22 --> 02:22:56.50
and he said, this ship is nice, Hancock,

3080
02:22:56.50 --> 02:23:01.34
but next week we're going down to get aboard the big guy.

3081
02:23:01.34 --> 02:23:02.82
Air conditioning doesn't work here,

3082
02:23:02.82 --> 02:23:05.86
and the food's not real good.

3083
02:23:05.86 --> 02:23:07.78
Better on a Hancock than everywhere.

3084
02:23:07.78 --> 02:23:10.70
I said, well, fortunes of war, I guess.

3085
02:23:10.70 --> 02:23:13.50
Yeah, I had a guy on the podcast named Dean Ladd,

3086
02:23:13.50 --> 02:23:14.98
who's a Marine in World War II,

3087
02:23:14.98 --> 02:23:17.06
and he went into a bunch of different islands,

3088
02:23:17.06 --> 02:23:21.06
but he was talking, he's going into Tarawa,

3089
02:23:21.06 --> 02:23:23.42
and I'm like, were you nervous going in?

3090
02:23:23.42 --> 02:23:25.06
He said, no, it's the other guys

3091
02:23:25.06 --> 02:23:27.02
that are going to get wounded and killed.

3092
02:23:27.02 --> 02:23:29.30
He ended up getting gut shot in Tarawa,

3093
02:23:29.30 --> 02:23:32.78
and was lucky, a couple of his Marines disobeyed the order

3094
02:23:32.78 --> 02:23:33.66
just to keep going,

3095
02:23:33.66 --> 02:23:35.26
and they grabbed him and threw him back on a ship,

3096
02:23:35.26 --> 02:23:39.30
so I think that's the common mental state

3097
02:23:39.30 --> 02:23:42.58
of the young man in combat is I really feel sorry

3098
02:23:42.58 --> 02:23:45.10
for the other guys that are going to have trouble out here

3099
02:23:45.10 --> 02:23:46.46
and get wounded and killed.

3100
02:23:46.46 --> 02:23:48.18
My favorite professor in college,

3101
02:23:48.18 --> 02:23:51.30
University of Chicago PhD, that's a big deal,

3102
02:23:51.30 --> 02:23:56.30
and Econ was a tail gunner in B-17s in World War II,

3103
02:23:57.14 --> 02:23:58.70
and I used to play chess with him,

3104
02:23:58.70 --> 02:24:01.26
and I said to him, what was it like?

3105
02:24:01.26 --> 02:24:03.98
He said, you always figured the other guy's going to get it.

3106
02:24:03.98 --> 02:24:06.98
That's the same thing I would just say.

3107
02:24:06.98 --> 02:24:09.98
That's a pretty impressive statement for a tail gunner,

3108
02:24:09.98 --> 02:24:11.90
B-17 in World War II.

3109
02:24:11.90 --> 02:24:14.62
He was a teenager, yeah, and he said,

3110
02:24:14.62 --> 02:24:16.74
you always, fortunes of war,

3111
02:24:16.74 --> 02:24:18.70
you figured the other guy's going to,

3112
02:24:18.70 --> 02:24:20.90
or you can always jump out, you know.

3113
02:24:20.90 --> 02:24:23.66
Yeah, that's one.

3114
02:24:23.66 --> 02:24:26.22
That would be the worst of it that you had to bail out.

3115
02:24:26.22 --> 02:24:28.34
Any other highlights from that deployment?

3116
02:24:30.70 --> 02:24:34.78
Well, like, as Skepper said to me,

3117
02:24:34.78 --> 02:24:37.82
we want to send somebody over to Thailand,

3118
02:24:37.82 --> 02:24:40.50
and since you have Air Force experience,

3119
02:24:40.50 --> 02:24:42.46
would you like to do it?

3120
02:24:42.46 --> 02:24:43.74
Well, yeah, why not?

3121
02:24:43.74 --> 02:24:45.46
And this is to be a forward air control or something?

3122
02:24:45.46 --> 02:24:50.46
No, just to make some judgments

3123
02:24:50.46 --> 02:24:54.38
and come back and relate how they do things over there

3124
02:24:54.38 --> 02:24:57.10
and how the facts work and stuff like that.

3125
02:24:57.10 --> 02:24:59.78
So I said, okay, and so they took me over in a cod,

3126
02:24:59.78 --> 02:25:02.98
and we did not get shot at in broad daylight.

3127
02:25:02.98 --> 02:25:04.50
Cod went out in daylight,

3128
02:25:04.50 --> 02:25:08.62
and we didn't get shot at crossing or anything out

3129
02:25:08.62 --> 02:25:11.06
into U-Bahn is where I went,

3130
02:25:11.06 --> 02:25:16.06
where Robin Oles was when he made his five kills

3131
02:25:16.66 --> 02:25:18.22
and stuff like that.

3132
02:25:18.22 --> 02:25:22.66
And initially, hard to get to first base there.

3133
02:25:22.66 --> 02:25:25.10
I said, it was like in the movies.

3134
02:25:25.10 --> 02:25:29.14
The cod pulled out onto the grass,

3135
02:25:29.14 --> 02:25:31.78
and the crewmen opened the back door and they hopped out.

3136
02:25:31.78 --> 02:25:36.78
They had shut down the starboard engine and door slammed.

3137
02:25:37.06 --> 02:25:39.54
Starboard engine started up, taxied away.

3138
02:25:39.54 --> 02:25:43.70
It was standing there with my suitcase on the grass.

3139
02:25:43.70 --> 02:25:48.70
This is just like a goofy movie from France

3140
02:25:49.90 --> 02:25:52.26
and World War II or something anyway.

3141
02:25:52.26 --> 02:25:57.26
So I got a guy, a trooper walking down the tarmac somewhere,

3142
02:25:57.90 --> 02:26:00.30
and I said, where's Base Operations?

3143
02:26:00.30 --> 02:26:02.38
Down the street, but you don't wanna go there.

3144
02:26:02.38 --> 02:26:03.26
Why?

3145
02:26:03.26 --> 02:26:06.06
Because we're not allowed to be here.

3146
02:26:06.06 --> 02:26:07.50
We're guests.

3147
02:26:07.50 --> 02:26:09.86
Oh, where do I go?

3148
02:26:09.86 --> 02:26:13.34
Building 386, it's on the second street over

3149
02:26:13.34 --> 02:26:15.98
and it has 386 on the outside.

3150
02:26:15.98 --> 02:26:17.38
And I'm making this part up,

3151
02:26:17.38 --> 02:26:19.70
but there's a bit in the essence of it.

3152
02:26:19.70 --> 02:26:22.82
That's the operations you want.

3153
02:26:22.82 --> 02:26:26.22
So I didn't have a place to sleep or anything.

3154
02:26:26.22 --> 02:26:30.70
I went there and it got a Marine, no,

3155
02:26:30.70 --> 02:26:35.38
Air Force Trooper, big guy, big guy with a sidearm

3156
02:26:35.38 --> 02:26:39.18
at a little lectern inside the door.

3157
02:26:39.18 --> 02:26:41.78
He said, basically he says, who the hell are you?

3158
02:26:41.78 --> 02:26:44.78
I mean, maybe uniform and whatnot.

3159
02:26:44.78 --> 02:26:48.70
And he said, not without whatever he needed.

3160
02:26:50.34 --> 02:26:52.98
So that night I went to the club

3161
02:26:52.98 --> 02:26:55.98
and I meet a guy, an Air Force major,

3162
02:26:55.98 --> 02:26:57.62
and he said, we can take care of you.

3163
02:26:57.62 --> 02:26:59.02
We'll get past that, don't worry about it.

3164
02:26:59.02 --> 02:27:02.38
And he took care of everything and stuff like that.

3165
02:27:02.38 --> 02:27:07.38
But Air Force operations were officially just a guest

3166
02:27:07.38 --> 02:27:09.10
and they were just don't officially,

3167
02:27:09.10 --> 02:27:13.90
the air force, the tarmac loaded with F-4s and C-130s.

3168
02:27:13.90 --> 02:27:17.94
So I got to fly with a guy who flew the OV-10,

3169
02:27:17.94 --> 02:27:20.46
which is a heck of a fun airplane to fly.

3170
02:27:20.46 --> 02:27:24.10
Man, oh man, I'd swap ends in a second with that thing.

3171
02:27:24.10 --> 02:27:27.10
I mean, this way and that sort of thing.

3172
02:27:27.10 --> 02:27:30.18
Tons of power, two turboprop engines

3173
02:27:30.18 --> 02:27:32.54
and designed for the Marines.

3174
02:27:32.54 --> 02:27:35.54
So you could put one in it, a couple of guys in the back

3175
02:27:35.54 --> 02:27:37.34
and they opened the hatch in the back

3176
02:27:37.34 --> 02:27:41.86
and the Marines can parachute out into middle of nowhere

3177
02:27:41.86 --> 02:27:43.58
and stuff like that.

3178
02:27:43.58 --> 02:27:47.46
And a good panel in the bay made an instrument approach

3179
02:27:47.46 --> 02:27:50.14
with that guy and he said, that's really something

3180
02:27:50.14 --> 02:27:51.94
off that terrible panel back there.

3181
02:27:51.94 --> 02:27:55.18
I said, yeah, well, you make about 100 passes at the ship

3182
02:27:55.18 --> 02:27:57.98
and then at night and it's not a big deal anymore.

3183
02:27:57.98 --> 02:28:02.98
Now, I flew with him maybe twice

3184
02:28:03.74 --> 02:28:06.74
and I flew with the C-130 gunship,

3185
02:28:06.74 --> 02:28:10.66
a C-130 forward air controller,

3186
02:28:10.66 --> 02:28:12.22
only at night for him though,

3187
02:28:12.22 --> 02:28:13.98
because it's a big target, I guess.

3188
02:28:16.02 --> 02:28:18.50
We had flown off of that guy,

3189
02:28:18.50 --> 02:28:20.82
but we didn't know what kind of airplane he had.

3190
02:28:21.78 --> 02:28:26.78
And let's see, the OV-10 and two times with the C-130,

3191
02:28:26.78 --> 02:28:29.34
two times with the C-130, there's only there a week.

3192
02:28:30.34 --> 02:28:34.46
And then back out to the ship,

3193
02:28:38.42 --> 02:28:43.42
C-130, no, C-47 had about eight or 10 Marine troopers

3194
02:28:48.66 --> 02:28:52.66
who were there on R&R at Yubon, Thailand.

3195
02:28:52.66 --> 02:28:55.18
They had been downtown and they all looked at it.

3196
02:28:55.18 --> 02:28:59.10
They were like, oh, they're the big night last night.

3197
02:29:00.02 --> 02:29:01.58
I don't know where they wound up going,

3198
02:29:01.58 --> 02:29:03.50
but they dropped me off at Hway,

3199
02:29:03.50 --> 02:29:06.10
it was right after the battle of Hway,

3200
02:29:06.10 --> 02:29:08.14
they destroyed everything.

3201
02:29:08.14 --> 02:29:12.62
And right next to the runway, Matt runway,

3202
02:29:12.62 --> 02:29:15.10
and when we landed on that, Matt runway,

3203
02:29:15.10 --> 02:29:15.98
they're shooting at us,

3204
02:29:15.98 --> 02:29:17.78
because it goes rattle, rattle, rattle,

3205
02:29:17.78 --> 02:29:20.58
and I thought, oh my God, there's something.

3206
02:29:20.58 --> 02:29:24.34
But that's, it was just a plank runway.

3207
02:29:24.34 --> 02:29:25.66
And then the Army was there.

3208
02:29:25.66 --> 02:29:30.66
And I thought, boy, sandbags and logs and mud,

3209
02:29:30.66 --> 02:29:33.82
and oh, thank heaven, I have no part of the Army.

3210
02:29:33.82 --> 02:29:36.02
And anyway, they sent the cod in there

3211
02:29:36.02 --> 02:29:39.62
and the cod picked me up and took me out to the ship.

3212
02:29:39.62 --> 02:29:41.50
So that was the end of that.

3213
02:29:41.50 --> 02:29:44.10
But that was quite an experience.

3214
02:29:46.42 --> 02:29:50.14
Those C-130 guys, they had call-onness,

3215
02:29:50.14 --> 02:29:54.78
they've sacked their parachutes back over here

3216
02:29:54.78 --> 02:29:57.26
and they have a pile back there.

3217
02:29:57.26 --> 02:29:58.94
Really?

3218
02:29:58.94 --> 02:30:00.38
What do you do if you get hit?

3219
02:30:00.38 --> 02:30:02.70
Because in my mind, you get hit,

3220
02:30:02.70 --> 02:30:05.34
you might take the whole wing off or the end of it

3221
02:30:05.34 --> 02:30:06.78
and then it starts to tumble

3222
02:30:06.78 --> 02:30:10.14
and you're not gonna have time to put on a parachute.

3223
02:30:10.14 --> 02:30:13.18
But they did, I think they lost more C-130s

3224
02:30:13.18 --> 02:30:16.90
than they ever admitted to over there.

3225
02:30:16.90 --> 02:30:21.58
Because the one I was on, the gunship, he's at 3,000 feet

3226
02:30:21.58 --> 02:30:26.14
and the 37 millimeter gets to 3,000 feet.

3227
02:30:26.14 --> 02:30:28.06
And the burst went off in front of the nose

3228
02:30:28.06 --> 02:30:31.62
and I hit the deck behind the naval flight deck

3229
02:30:31.62 --> 02:30:33.10
on that airplane.

3230
02:30:33.10 --> 02:30:37.26
I was on the floor as we flew through the smoke.

3231
02:30:37.26 --> 02:30:40.14
And they said, what was that?

3232
02:30:40.14 --> 02:30:41.74
I said, for heaven's sake, it went off right.

3233
02:30:41.74 --> 02:30:44.78
Yeah, but it falls away, don't worry about it.

3234
02:30:44.78 --> 02:30:46.54
All right?

3235
02:30:46.54 --> 02:30:47.98
But we flew through the smoke.

3236
02:30:47.98 --> 02:30:50.42
I saw the smoke go over the windshield.

3237
02:30:51.62 --> 02:30:53.54
And I got the flight C-130 a little bit,

3238
02:30:53.54 --> 02:30:56.50
just steer it around, not a big deal.

3239
02:30:56.50 --> 02:30:58.82
But anyway, that's what I did in Thailand.

3240
02:30:58.82 --> 02:31:00.50
Then I came back to the ship and I said,

3241
02:31:00.50 --> 02:31:01.74
what about this and what about that?

3242
02:31:01.74 --> 02:31:06.26
And that's when I saw those F-4s making multiple passes

3243
02:31:06.26 --> 02:31:10.22
from the same direction at 30 degrees dive

3244
02:31:11.46 --> 02:31:14.94
and not just the same direction,

3245
02:31:14.94 --> 02:31:17.78
but both airplanes from the same direction.

3246
02:31:19.78 --> 02:31:23.70
Maybe you're losing airplanes and I think I know why.

3247
02:31:23.70 --> 02:31:25.62
No talking them out of it.

3248
02:31:25.62 --> 02:31:28.78
I think if you are encouraged to think

3249
02:31:28.78 --> 02:31:32.58
that 60 degree angle of dive is dangerous, you'll believe it.

3250
02:31:34.70 --> 02:31:36.58
But it's not, it's safer.

3251
02:31:36.58 --> 02:31:37.82
It's a better way to go.

3252
02:31:37.82 --> 02:31:39.14
And when I saw that picture,

3253
02:31:40.14 --> 02:31:43.02
I don't know if I said this now,

3254
02:31:43.02 --> 02:31:46.02
there's a famous picture taken during the Battle of Midway.

3255
02:31:46.02 --> 02:31:49.42
And that guy is virtually 89 degrees

3256
02:31:50.30 --> 02:31:52.02
all above a Japanese carrier.

3257
02:31:53.34 --> 02:31:55.66
So that's the way to do it, I thought.

3258
02:31:55.66 --> 02:31:57.78
And besides, gotta get the barrel all the way up there.

3259
02:31:57.78 --> 02:31:58.78
Maybe he can't do that.

3260
02:32:01.46 --> 02:32:04.22
So you get done with that deployment.

3261
02:32:05.74 --> 02:32:08.46
Head back to the States, now it's what, 1970?

3262
02:32:10.74 --> 02:32:11.58
Yeah.

3263
02:32:11.58 --> 02:32:13.74
And you're coming back to America now,

3264
02:32:13.74 --> 02:32:17.54
now you got the protests and all this stuff going on.

3265
02:32:17.54 --> 02:32:19.58
Where's that, are you seeing that?

3266
02:32:19.58 --> 02:32:20.86
Are you aware of that?

3267
02:32:20.86 --> 02:32:22.50
What's, how's that impacted you?

3268
02:32:22.50 --> 02:32:23.62
Very much so.

3269
02:32:23.62 --> 02:32:27.30
And I think you just get used to it.

3270
02:32:27.30 --> 02:32:29.38
The thing that you wouldn't get used to

3271
02:32:29.38 --> 02:32:31.70
if you were a newly married guy,

3272
02:32:31.70 --> 02:32:35.02
and that was me and a lot of other guys too,

3273
02:32:35.02 --> 02:32:37.18
that they would call up your house and say,

3274
02:32:37.18 --> 02:32:39.70
tell you that, tell your little wife

3275
02:32:39.70 --> 02:32:42.54
that you had been killed that night.

3276
02:32:42.54 --> 02:32:46.34
This is stateside, before you went to sea.

3277
02:32:46.34 --> 02:32:48.38
Very evil, that's evil.

3278
02:32:49.26 --> 02:32:53.02
And then of course we had a couple of bad actions.

3279
02:32:53.02 --> 02:32:56.34
There was a Navy Cod, I think an old one,

3280
02:32:56.34 --> 02:33:00.30
with a bunch of guys on board that crashed on San Clemente

3281
02:33:01.66 --> 02:33:03.94
before we sailed.

3282
02:33:03.94 --> 02:33:06.70
That was very bad and made my wife very squirrely,

3283
02:33:06.70 --> 02:33:08.50
my young wife.

3284
02:33:08.50 --> 02:33:11.14
There's a funny thing, there's a funny one here.

3285
02:33:11.14 --> 02:33:15.98
I went to the East Coast and I flew out to the East Coast

3286
02:33:15.98 --> 02:33:18.26
so then I have to ride back.

3287
02:33:18.26 --> 02:33:23.26
So we're on a DC-4, C-40, 51,

3288
02:33:24.66 --> 02:33:27.50
or God knows what, a four engine,

3289
02:33:27.50 --> 02:33:31.34
unpressurized Navy transport.

3290
02:33:31.34 --> 02:33:34.58
And we get to Houston and the guy says,

3291
02:33:34.58 --> 02:33:36.94
ah, we'll be here overnight because

3292
02:33:36.94 --> 02:33:41.94
we wasn't so on the third engine or something

3293
02:33:42.18 --> 02:33:45.14
that's not right and so be prepared.

3294
02:33:45.14 --> 02:33:47.86
We'll have it, it'll be ready by morning.

3295
02:33:47.86 --> 02:33:50.90
So at any rate, we were supposed to be back

3296
02:33:50.90 --> 02:33:53.54
at Miramar by six p.m. more or less.

3297
02:33:53.54 --> 02:33:56.34
I sent her, called her or something

3298
02:33:56.34 --> 02:33:59.06
from the East Coast from Norfolk.

3299
02:33:59.06 --> 02:34:01.38
So she calls the duty officer

3300
02:34:01.38 --> 02:34:04.50
and the Whitehead sailor who's on duty too,

3301
02:34:04.50 --> 02:34:07.50
he answers the phone and she says, is this Mrs. Coppell?

3302
02:34:07.50 --> 02:34:10.18
Is my husband gonna be there tonight?

3303
02:34:10.18 --> 02:34:12.18
Well, it's his ETA and he says,

3304
02:34:12.18 --> 02:34:14.42
oh no, the airplane went down in Houston.

3305
02:34:15.34 --> 02:34:16.18
Jesus.

3306
02:34:18.18 --> 02:34:21.78
So, now wait, it gets better than that.

3307
02:34:21.78 --> 02:34:23.66
She figured she was a widow.

3308
02:34:23.66 --> 02:34:26.06
What to do about this?

3309
02:34:26.06 --> 02:34:29.34
Next morning, coming up the side of the building

3310
02:34:29.34 --> 02:34:32.04
are two guys with gold braid on their sleeves.

3311
02:34:32.04 --> 02:34:36.32
And she said, well, this is it.

3312
02:34:36.32 --> 02:34:40.04
Steal myself, they're gonna tell me what happened.

3313
02:34:40.04 --> 02:34:41.40
I walk in the door.

3314
02:34:41.40 --> 02:34:46.24
No, anyway, funny story and she still likes

3315
02:34:46.24 --> 02:34:49.24
to tell it to her friends from time to time.

3316
02:34:50.28 --> 02:34:51.12
Oh man.

3317
02:34:52.48 --> 02:34:55.24
So there is, there's this 1970, you come home,

3318
02:34:55.24 --> 02:34:58.64
there's obviously a lot of division in America.

3319
02:34:58.64 --> 02:34:59.72
Right.

3320
02:34:59.72 --> 02:35:02.40
And what do you end up doing when you get back?

3321
02:35:02.40 --> 02:35:07.40
Well, the re-asked Tom if he wants to stay or go

3322
02:35:08.20 --> 02:35:12.000
and I said, my father-in-law offered me a job,

3323
02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:13.28
so I'm gonna go.

3324
02:35:13.28 --> 02:35:17.36
And I had too many dead friends by that point too.

3325
02:35:17.36 --> 02:35:20.28
And I said, I think I'll just get out.

3326
02:35:20.28 --> 02:35:22.68
And I said, well, we're gonna send you to be an ACM

3327
02:35:22.68 --> 02:35:24.60
instructor at Kingsville.

3328
02:35:24.60 --> 02:35:27.88
And I said, I don't wanna go back to Texas.

3329
02:35:27.88 --> 02:35:30.40
I said, I don't like that place.

3330
02:35:30.40 --> 02:35:32.20
He said, well, we could send you to Meridian,

3331
02:35:32.20 --> 02:35:35.28
but it's only basic instruction.

3332
02:35:35.28 --> 02:35:36.92
I said, that's for me.

3333
02:35:36.92 --> 02:35:41.64
Cause a pal had told me that he got plowed back at Meridian

3334
02:35:41.64 --> 02:35:44.84
and it's really nice place, nice people there.

3335
02:35:44.84 --> 02:35:46.24
So I said, let me go to Meridian.

3336
02:35:46.24 --> 02:35:49.36
And so they put me in Meridian and I was an instructor there

3337
02:35:49.36 --> 02:35:52.08
for my last something like 14 months.

3338
02:35:52.08 --> 02:35:55.28
And I had good students and mediocre instructors

3339
02:35:55.28 --> 02:35:57.56
and students and so forth.

3340
02:35:57.56 --> 02:35:59.52
I wonder what happened to the best of them.

3341
02:35:59.52 --> 02:36:02.28
I've never been, I've typed his name into Google.

3342
02:36:03.12 --> 02:36:05.60
No, I don't know.

3343
02:36:05.60 --> 02:36:08.000
I had Marines, bloody old Marines.

3344
02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:12.20
As one guy, I was his instructor and then his pal,

3345
02:36:12.20 --> 02:36:13.72
I flew with him a couple of times.

3346
02:36:13.72 --> 02:36:18.72
They were recon Marines, which is this Navy SEAL level stuff.

3347
02:36:19.80 --> 02:36:22.04
And I foolishly said to one of them,

3348
02:36:22.04 --> 02:36:25.12
this is really foolish, this is naive.

3349
02:36:25.12 --> 02:36:29.60
I said, you get healed into Northern Laos

3350
02:36:29.60 --> 02:36:33.72
and you get dropped off in the jungle

3351
02:36:33.72 --> 02:36:36.52
and you know you're going to be there for at least a week

3352
02:36:36.52 --> 02:36:38.36
with plenty of ammunition.

3353
02:36:38.36 --> 02:36:40.44
Really, what do you do?

3354
02:36:40.44 --> 02:36:43.32
He said, well, we hunt for the North Vietnamese.

3355
02:36:43.32 --> 02:36:45.44
They train up there and they're in the jungle

3356
02:36:45.44 --> 02:36:49.28
and they're easy to find because they smoke so much ganja

3357
02:36:49.28 --> 02:36:52.52
that you can smell them if they're upwind from you.

3358
02:36:52.52 --> 02:36:53.36
Oh really?

3359
02:36:53.36 --> 02:36:55.36
So what do you do then?

3360
02:36:55.36 --> 02:36:58.80
He said, well, you move around so you are in fact downwind

3361
02:36:58.80 --> 02:37:01.68
and then you get close enough to them

3362
02:37:01.68 --> 02:37:04.88
and you set up and with your weapons and whatnot

3363
02:37:04.88 --> 02:37:09.88
and you wait till dawn so they start walking around.

3364
02:37:10.64 --> 02:37:12.56
Yeah, then what do you do?

3365
02:37:12.56 --> 02:37:14.84
Oh, well, we kill them all.

3366
02:37:14.84 --> 02:37:16.96
Oh, excuse me.

3367
02:37:16.96 --> 02:37:18.60
I was a little naive there.

3368
02:37:18.60 --> 02:37:21.92
But these are the anyway.

3369
02:37:21.92 --> 02:37:26.12
And the guy who was my student,

3370
02:37:26.12 --> 02:37:29.52
I wonder what a nice guy, both of them nice guys,

3371
02:37:32.44 --> 02:37:35.52
he would say to me, Tom, we're first name bases

3372
02:37:35.52 --> 02:37:37.64
and we're in captain at that point.

3373
02:37:37.64 --> 02:37:41.12
Tom, Tom, Tom, how do you do a barrel roll attack?

3374
02:37:41.12 --> 02:37:42.24
See that guy over there?

3375
02:37:42.24 --> 02:37:44.32
Make a barrel roll attack on that guy.

3376
02:37:45.36 --> 02:37:46.92
Richard, I'm not supposed to do that.

3377
02:37:46.92 --> 02:37:48.92
You know that.

3378
02:37:48.92 --> 02:37:49.76
Come on.

3379
02:37:52.48 --> 02:37:57.40
Make a big rolling thing on the student flying,

3380
02:37:57.40 --> 02:37:58.76
students never look around.

3381
02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:01.48
He's flying over there.

3382
02:38:01.48 --> 02:38:03.64
Make a big mock.

3383
02:38:03.64 --> 02:38:05.36
Wow, let me try it.

3384
02:38:05.36 --> 02:38:06.32
Go away over here.

3385
02:38:06.32 --> 02:38:07.68
He tried it.

3386
02:38:07.68 --> 02:38:08.64
That's angry.

3387
02:38:09.56 --> 02:38:12.96
Or the other thing with him, you fly in a back cockpit,

3388
02:38:12.96 --> 02:38:16.08
you have him setting, all fighter planes

3389
02:38:16.08 --> 02:38:18.96
or Navy trainers have rear view mirrors.

3390
02:38:18.96 --> 02:38:22.52
If you need rear view mirrors in a fighter plane,

3391
02:38:22.52 --> 02:38:24.48
you're wasting your time.

3392
02:38:24.48 --> 02:38:26.40
You are long gone.

3393
02:38:28.12 --> 02:38:31.76
When I came back or let's say from halfway through the crew,

3394
02:38:31.76 --> 02:38:34.68
you become a nutcase in the cockpit, at least I did.

3395
02:38:34.68 --> 02:38:38.88
I wanna know everything that's on the horizon, 360.

3396
02:38:38.88 --> 02:38:42.24
That's the only way to genuinely be certain

3397
02:38:42.24 --> 02:38:45.48
you're gonna survive this thing and stuff like that.

3398
02:38:45.48 --> 02:38:49.80
So you become a minor nutcase.

3399
02:38:49.80 --> 02:38:52.60
Looking around, looking around.

3400
02:38:52.60 --> 02:38:53.44
And so forth.

3401
02:38:53.44 --> 02:38:54.60
Then to a young guy, I would say,

3402
02:38:54.60 --> 02:38:56.04
how the hell do you fly the airplane

3403
02:38:56.04 --> 02:38:58.40
if you're spending that much time?

3404
02:38:58.40 --> 02:38:59.24
Well, you do.

3405
02:38:59.24 --> 02:39:01.28
You get skilled at it.

3406
02:39:01.28 --> 02:39:05.20
It's just time that you get better and better at doing it.

3407
02:39:06.40 --> 02:39:08.12
But I would have them turn their mirrors

3408
02:39:08.12 --> 02:39:10.52
so I could see this much of their face.

3409
02:39:10.52 --> 02:39:13.88
Everything else is oxygen mask, helmet and oxygen mask.

3410
02:39:13.88 --> 02:39:15.40
But I wanna see this part of that.

3411
02:39:15.40 --> 02:39:16.80
I wanna see where they're looking.

3412
02:39:16.80 --> 02:39:19.16
I don't want you to see you, Mr. Wilson,

3413
02:39:19.16 --> 02:39:20.36
looking at the panel.

3414
02:39:20.36 --> 02:39:22.68
I want you looking outside.

3415
02:39:22.68 --> 02:39:24.72
Mr. Wilson, you're down in the panel again.

3416
02:39:24.72 --> 02:39:27.000
I want you outside to cockpit here.

3417
02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.56
Well, Mr. Coppell, I have trouble flying level.

3418
02:39:29.56 --> 02:39:32.48
I said I'd rather see you bumping around

3419
02:39:32.48 --> 02:39:36.40
in a little off altitude than getting shot down later

3420
02:39:36.40 --> 02:39:38.80
because it's that important and so forth.

3421
02:39:38.80 --> 02:39:42.24
So with Rich Freeman, I would like all of them.

3422
02:39:42.24 --> 02:39:46.68
So I'd see him trying to fly level and make,

3423
02:39:46.68 --> 02:39:49.24
Mr. Rich, I want you to make a 30 degree angle turn

3424
02:39:49.24 --> 02:39:52.20
and roll out a two seven, okay.

3425
02:39:52.20 --> 02:39:54.32
And he's doing a little bit of this.

3426
02:39:54.32 --> 02:39:57.000
And he starts to get red in here.

3427
02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:00.84
So Marine getting angry and not good thing.

3428
02:40:01.76 --> 02:40:04.80
He said, Rich, don't get upset.

3429
02:40:04.80 --> 02:40:07.92
Remember I told you, you wanna hold the stick

3430
02:40:07.92 --> 02:40:10.84
with two fingers and trim off the pressure.

3431
02:40:10.84 --> 02:40:13.76
Move it and then trim off the pressure.

3432
02:40:13.76 --> 02:40:15.28
Two fingers, that's all you need.

3433
02:40:15.28 --> 02:40:17.000
I really do it that way.

3434
02:40:18.08 --> 02:40:19.08
Okay, well I tried again.

3435
02:40:19.08 --> 02:40:21.20
Come back three six, okay.

3436
02:40:21.20 --> 02:40:23.48
He comes back and he's getting redder.

3437
02:40:24.76 --> 02:40:28.56
I said, Rich, do you feel that in the airframe?

3438
02:40:29.48 --> 02:40:30.60
Yeah, what is it?

3439
02:40:30.60 --> 02:40:34.000
I said, that's me back here.

3440
02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:35.56
Founding on the pole.

3441
02:40:35.56 --> 02:40:38.80
He's got it in the vice grip with white knuckles

3442
02:40:38.80 --> 02:40:40.60
and his elbow in here.

3443
02:40:40.60 --> 02:40:42.88
Trying to fly this thing a light, Rich,

3444
02:40:42.88 --> 02:40:44.68
it doesn't work that way.

3445
02:40:45.68 --> 02:40:47.24
But anyway.

3446
02:40:47.24 --> 02:40:49.000
You gotta relax, I guess.

3447
02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:52.000
Ah, I don't know.

3448
02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:53.60
I don't know.

3449
02:40:53.60 --> 02:40:58.60
I think when you come back and they're shooting at you

3450
02:40:58.60 --> 02:41:01.72
and you get bored at night in bad weather,

3451
02:41:01.72 --> 02:41:03.88
you're soaking wet and you're tired.

3452
02:41:05.32 --> 02:41:08.56
Do you burn more calories, I think so.

3453
02:41:08.56 --> 02:41:12.72
There was a study done before the Vietnam War

3454
02:41:12.72 --> 02:41:14.16
and they did it with A4s.

3455
02:41:14.16 --> 02:41:17.28
And I bet you David knows about this.

3456
02:41:17.28 --> 02:41:20.68
They asked these A4 guys to,

3457
02:41:20.68 --> 02:41:24.12
oh no, it was during, at the beginning of the Vietnam War,

3458
02:41:24.12 --> 02:41:25.56
that's how it would work.

3459
02:41:25.56 --> 02:41:30.56
They had a recorder that put a pen mark on a disk of paper.

3460
02:41:34.16 --> 02:41:38.32
And then they wired these guys with sweat

3461
02:41:38.32 --> 02:41:43.32
and lung function and heart function and so forth.

3462
02:41:44.44 --> 02:41:46.48
And they found out that just what they figured,

3463
02:41:46.48 --> 02:41:51.48
you go in and feet dry and everything comes up

3464
02:41:51.68 --> 02:41:54.88
and you get in the target area, comes up even higher,

3465
02:41:54.88 --> 02:41:58.32
get off the target area, comes down a little bit,

3466
02:41:58.32 --> 02:42:00.84
get feet wet, comes way down.

3467
02:42:01.72 --> 02:42:04.60
And it was way up here in the target area.

3468
02:42:04.60 --> 02:42:08.44
And then you talk to the ship and it goes up here,

3469
02:42:08.44 --> 02:42:10.84
that much higher.

3470
02:42:10.84 --> 02:42:12.32
Higher than the target area.

3471
02:42:12.32 --> 02:42:17.32
Right, because at the ship everything is right here,

3472
02:42:17.60 --> 02:42:22.60
whereas in the target area it's fortunes of war.

3473
02:42:24.32 --> 02:42:28.44
It's good tactics, but to a certain extent

3474
02:42:28.44 --> 02:42:31.84
it's out of your hands, so you do your best.

3475
02:42:31.84 --> 02:42:35.80
But if you're gonna smack the ramp or do something

3476
02:42:35.80 --> 02:42:40.80
bad like that, it's right there in your hands.

3477
02:42:41.08 --> 02:42:43.04
And that was A4s.

3478
02:42:43.04 --> 02:42:48.28
So yeah, you will burn more calories in your tired guy.

3479
02:42:50.28 --> 02:42:53.08
And then you stand around the right room and smoke cigarettes.

3480
02:42:54.08 --> 02:42:54.92
Really?

3481
02:42:56.76 --> 02:42:58.24
When did you quit smoking?

3482
02:42:58.24 --> 02:43:02.000
Well, right after that I quit smoking.

3483
02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:06.28
And how was your transition into the civilian life?

3484
02:43:06.28 --> 02:43:11.28
Difficult, because you are used to a guy who says that,

3485
02:43:14.96 --> 02:43:18.08
he does that, and civilian world's not that way.

3486
02:43:19.32 --> 02:43:23.36
Guy says, can you loan me 50 bucks until next Wednesday

3487
02:43:23.36 --> 02:43:25.16
in the Navy, he comes looking for you.

3488
02:43:25.16 --> 02:43:28.56
And civilian world, you gotta go looking for him.

3489
02:43:30.68 --> 02:43:32.88
Hey Eddie, give me my 50 bucks.

3490
02:43:32.88 --> 02:43:37.000
Oh, I'll give you half of it, it's all I have, I say.

3491
02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:40.84
Okay, so he was a little bit rocky.

3492
02:43:40.84 --> 02:43:43.56
And I went into business for myself

3493
02:43:43.56 --> 02:43:46.84
because my wife thought that might be a good idea for us.

3494
02:43:46.84 --> 02:43:51.36
And the antique Persian rug business of all things.

3495
02:43:51.36 --> 02:43:56.36
So I wound up making friends with a lot of Persian guys,

3496
02:43:56.44 --> 02:43:59.04
most of them Jews, a couple of them I still know,

3497
02:43:59.04 --> 02:44:02.32
to this day I call them up saying, how the heck are you?

3498
02:44:02.32 --> 02:44:05.64
Couple of Muslim guys, all nice people.

3499
02:44:07.48 --> 02:44:10.56
You had to be, because you were sort of all in that,

3500
02:44:10.56 --> 02:44:14.12
I've been in the Navy, we're all in this mess together.

3501
02:44:14.12 --> 02:44:19.12
So I figured in that business I had it,

3502
02:44:19.12 --> 02:44:24.12
because you have retail customers who talk to you

3503
02:44:24.24 --> 02:44:26.88
and say I've been looking for a lesson so typed,

3504
02:44:26.88 --> 02:44:27.72
you know what that is?

3505
02:44:27.72 --> 02:44:29.16
Oh, yes.

3506
02:44:29.16 --> 02:44:34.04
I need it 18 feet, but no longer than 19.

3507
02:44:34.04 --> 02:44:36.68
And I need it thus and so wide.

3508
02:44:36.68 --> 02:44:39.76
No, I don't want anywhere, but I want more of this color

3509
02:44:39.76 --> 02:44:41.96
and so can you do that?

3510
02:44:41.96 --> 02:44:45.40
You get on, as soon as I leave, you get on a phone call.

3511
02:44:45.40 --> 02:44:49.24
Mohammed and you call Hakim and you call that guy.

3512
02:44:49.24 --> 02:44:51.60
I'm saying, I have what you want

3513
02:44:51.60 --> 02:44:55.000
and he will give it to you on your signature

3514
02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.12
if your credit is good.

3515
02:44:58.04 --> 02:45:01.36
I figured I called a guy one time and he said,

3516
02:45:01.36 --> 02:45:04.000
I don't have it, but I know who does have it.

3517
02:45:04.000 --> 02:45:06.72
He's an old Armenian guy and he's really crotchety

3518
02:45:06.72 --> 02:45:08.60
and he shouldn't be in business anymore,

3519
02:45:08.60 --> 02:45:12.16
but he's got some nice choice stuff.

3520
02:45:12.16 --> 02:45:15.72
This is in New York, 28th Street, 31st Street

3521
02:45:15.72 --> 02:45:18.52
in that neighborhood, Feth Avenue.

3522
02:45:18.52 --> 02:45:22.88
And I said, I need this and that and this and that

3523
02:45:22.88 --> 02:45:23.80
and this and that.

3524
02:45:23.80 --> 02:45:25.56
Yes, yes.

3525
02:45:25.56 --> 02:45:28.40
I said, my credit, I said, you don't know me,

3526
02:45:28.40 --> 02:45:31.96
but I have, I called those and so and call him

3527
02:45:31.96 --> 02:45:35.24
and you could call him, I don't have to do that.

3528
02:45:35.24 --> 02:45:36.44
I said, really why?

3529
02:45:36.44 --> 02:45:38.80
I know who you are.

3530
02:45:38.80 --> 02:45:40.88
I could have it on my signature.

3531
02:45:40.88 --> 02:45:45.88
I drove away one time with 80,000 in wholesale value

3532
02:45:47.60 --> 02:45:51.32
in back of my truck and I figured that was a mistake,

3533
02:45:51.32 --> 02:45:53.52
no signature, they know who I am.

3534
02:45:53.52 --> 02:45:57.16
But nice people, a lot of nice people,

3535
02:45:57.16 --> 02:45:59.84
not like what you read in the paper.

3536
02:45:59.84 --> 02:46:01.52
Did you miss the Navy?

3537
02:46:01.52 --> 02:46:06.20
Oh yeah, yeah, a lot of pals and stuff like that,

3538
02:46:06.20 --> 02:46:08.40
but you have to get away from that.

3539
02:46:08.40 --> 02:46:10.04
You can't live in the past.

3540
02:46:10.04 --> 02:46:11.88
You gotta keep going.

3541
02:46:11.88 --> 02:46:15.36
So we had a lot of, I keep saying this,

3542
02:46:15.36 --> 02:46:17.68
but I had a lot of fun doing that too.

3543
02:46:17.68 --> 02:46:22.68
So, and down to my wife, I bought a piece

3544
02:46:22.68 --> 02:46:27.68
for several thousand and I came back

3545
02:46:27.76 --> 02:46:31.28
and maybe two days later and I said,

3546
02:46:31.28 --> 02:46:33.56
where's the, you know, those and so?

3547
02:46:33.56 --> 02:46:34.76
She said, I sold it.

3548
02:46:34.76 --> 02:46:39.76
She said, I said, I hope you got more than $5,600 for it.

3549
02:46:41.56 --> 02:46:43.44
She said, I got 75.

3550
02:46:43.44 --> 02:46:48.08
Is that what one of those rugs cost?

3551
02:46:48.08 --> 02:46:50.08
How much one of those rugs cost?

3552
02:46:50.08 --> 02:46:51.60
It depends on what it is.

3553
02:46:51.60 --> 02:46:53.36
It depends on its age.

3554
02:46:53.36 --> 02:46:55.52
It depends on its condition.

3555
02:46:55.52 --> 02:46:58.56
You have to deal with somebody that you know

3556
02:46:58.56 --> 02:47:03.44
is utterly trustworthy because Henry Kissinger got fleeced

3557
02:47:03.44 --> 02:47:07.36
on a trip to Tehran and he knew it after it was all over.

3558
02:47:07.36 --> 02:47:08.80
Well, what happened to him?

3559
02:47:08.80 --> 02:47:10.96
I don't know exactly what the thing was,

3560
02:47:10.96 --> 02:47:14.84
but he admitted to the fact that all he did was

3561
02:47:14.84 --> 02:47:16.72
take that load of stuff that I bought

3562
02:47:16.72 --> 02:47:19.80
and send it to a dealer somewhere to get rid of it.

3563
02:47:19.80 --> 02:47:21.72
Because it was junk and he paid a bunch of money for it?

3564
02:47:21.72 --> 02:47:24.04
It was very embarrassing, yeah.

3565
02:47:24.04 --> 02:47:27.68
And then you ended up in the bakery business, right?

3566
02:47:27.68 --> 02:47:29.36
Bread making business, that where you're at now?

3567
02:47:29.36 --> 02:47:33.04
Yeah, well, this is Jaco saying

3568
02:47:33.04 --> 02:47:36.04
when you're in the middle of the woods, start walking.

3569
02:47:36.04 --> 02:47:38.000
And the guy says, which direction?

3570
02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:39.72
And Jaco says, doesn't matter.

3571
02:47:39.72 --> 02:47:40.48
Yeah, start walking.

3572
02:47:40.48 --> 02:47:42.12
But I knew how to do that.

3573
02:47:42.12 --> 02:47:44.56
So Pamela said, why don't you make some bread?

3574
02:47:44.56 --> 02:47:47.92
And Pamela's brother is, believe it or not,

3575
02:47:47.92 --> 02:47:50.28
in the exotic mushroom business.

3576
02:47:50.28 --> 02:47:53.60
And they have an outdoor farmers market.

3577
02:47:53.60 --> 02:47:57.36
They were used to common in Pennsylvania on Sunday afternoons.

3578
02:47:57.36 --> 02:47:59.68
And give them to Joe and see if he can sell them.

3579
02:47:59.68 --> 02:48:01.68
He sold them all.

3580
02:48:01.68 --> 02:48:05.000
I'm doing it by hand.

3581
02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:08.16
So same thing again next week and so forth.

3582
02:48:08.16 --> 02:48:11.44
And he comes back and says, Fred says,

3583
02:48:11.44 --> 02:48:12.64
you ought to take a table here.

3584
02:48:12.64 --> 02:48:13.64
Your stuff is good enough.

3585
02:48:13.64 --> 02:48:17.40
I said, holy smoke, but I can only do so much by hand.

3586
02:48:17.40 --> 02:48:22.76
So I had a guy that I did business, drug business, antique

3587
02:48:22.76 --> 02:48:23.24
drug business.

3588
02:48:23.24 --> 02:48:26.16
If you find anything like that, Tom, call me.

3589
02:48:26.16 --> 02:48:27.96
How you do and so forth.

3590
02:48:27.96 --> 02:48:31.60
So I was coming out of buy all the time, whatever you could.

3591
02:48:31.60 --> 02:48:37.48
And so I used to go to a lot of outdoor country auctions, more

3592
02:48:37.48 --> 02:48:39.24
country than anything else.

3593
02:48:39.24 --> 02:48:42.04
And they had rugs from the 30s.

3594
02:48:42.04 --> 02:48:47.24
And I'd drive to Altoona, as I did in this case, with my truck,

3595
02:48:47.24 --> 02:48:49.76
Chevy Van, no windows.

3596
02:48:49.76 --> 02:48:54.24
And I buy the rugs for $1,500 because there's

3597
02:48:54.24 --> 02:48:59.40
certain human psychology, certain price levels in which

3598
02:48:59.40 --> 02:49:05.20
a retail customer, knowing that you could pay more,

3599
02:49:05.20 --> 02:49:08.40
but I won't do that because I don't want surprises

3600
02:49:08.40 --> 02:49:09.52
and stuff like that.

3601
02:49:09.52 --> 02:49:12.04
So you know you're going to get them for $1,500

3602
02:49:12.04 --> 02:49:12.88
if you drive all.

3603
02:49:12.88 --> 02:49:14.28
Because you talk to the auctioneer

3604
02:49:14.28 --> 02:49:16.16
and he tells you more or less what it is.

3605
02:49:16.16 --> 02:49:18.12
And he thinks he knows and stuff like that.

3606
02:49:18.12 --> 02:49:20.92
So he drives to Altoona and you look at it and say, yeah,

3607
02:49:20.92 --> 02:49:23.12
I can get $6,000 for this.

3608
02:49:23.12 --> 02:49:26.92
I won't pay more than, have to pay more than $1,500.

3609
02:49:26.92 --> 02:49:27.60
And you do that.

3610
02:49:27.60 --> 02:49:30.92
So I came back from Altoona that day to this guy's place.

3611
02:49:30.92 --> 02:49:33.48
And he's in a secondhand equipment business,

3612
02:49:33.48 --> 02:49:37.32
secondhand commercial equipment, big ovens and mixers

3613
02:49:37.32 --> 02:49:38.52
and things like that.

3614
02:49:38.52 --> 02:49:40.64
They go on forever.

3615
02:49:40.64 --> 02:49:44.52
And he said, you bake bread once in a while.

3616
02:49:44.52 --> 02:49:47.20
And I didn't buy anything that day.

3617
02:49:47.20 --> 02:49:51.64
And I had money in my pocket, cash in my pocket.

3618
02:49:51.64 --> 02:49:53.76
He sent a couple of nice ovens over here.

3619
02:49:53.76 --> 02:49:56.48
I said, I'm not interested.

3620
02:49:56.48 --> 02:49:57.80
He said, look at them.

3621
02:49:57.80 --> 02:49:58.36
They're diner size.

3622
02:49:58.36 --> 02:50:00.44
They're not the full size.

3623
02:50:00.44 --> 02:50:04.28
You've got to find exactly the right guy.

3624
02:50:04.28 --> 02:50:08.28
Probably a diner, but he already has.

3625
02:50:08.28 --> 02:50:12.92
I'll sell them to you for $900.

3626
02:50:12.92 --> 02:50:14.04
I don't want them.

3627
02:50:14.04 --> 02:50:16.44
He said, I can slide them right onto your truck.

3628
02:50:16.44 --> 02:50:20.16
And he didn't know I had money in my pocket either.

3629
02:50:20.16 --> 02:50:21.16
Yeah, he did.

3630
02:50:21.16 --> 02:50:24.08
Yeah, maybe.

3631
02:50:24.08 --> 02:50:27.44
So finally I said, OK.

3632
02:50:27.44 --> 02:50:30.84
So then I had to install them myself.

3633
02:50:30.84 --> 02:50:32.72
We live in an old Pennsylvania Dutch.

3634
02:50:32.72 --> 02:50:37.40
I call them a Pennsylvania German soft brick drafty.

3635
02:50:37.40 --> 02:50:39.96
And they have matching porches on both sides.

3636
02:50:39.96 --> 02:50:41.36
And this is porches in clothes.

3637
02:50:41.36 --> 02:50:45.08
So I put them on that porch and had heavy.

3638
02:50:45.08 --> 02:50:48.64
You know, they weigh, I don't know, 1,000 a piece, I guess.

3639
02:50:48.64 --> 02:50:52.24
Jacks and everything and blocks and getting it up and sliding

3640
02:50:52.24 --> 02:50:54.28
over and installing both of them.

3641
02:50:54.28 --> 02:50:58.20
But I didn't do very much until my sister-in-law actually

3642
02:50:58.20 --> 02:51:03.20
said, you need to put bread with Joe at the skip-hack.

3643
02:51:03.20 --> 02:51:04.60
Farmers market on Sunday.

3644
02:51:04.60 --> 02:51:08.12
So then one thing led to another led to another.

3645
02:51:08.12 --> 02:51:11.56
And then I went to this nice guy at Kimberton Whole Foods,

3646
02:51:11.56 --> 02:51:14.000
who was at the time he had one store.

3647
02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.96
And he was on the floor himself.

3648
02:51:16.96 --> 02:51:20.32
And I said, do you think he can sell these?

3649
02:51:20.32 --> 02:51:24.92
He said, probably not, because a lot of us just bailed out of here.

3650
02:51:24.92 --> 02:51:27.52
But you can put it on their shelves if you want.

3651
02:51:27.52 --> 02:51:30.84
Came back the next day and there was six of them sold.

3652
02:51:30.84 --> 02:51:32.04
I said, can I put more?

3653
02:51:32.04 --> 02:51:32.92
Of course.

3654
02:51:32.92 --> 02:51:34.16
So one thing led to another.

3655
02:51:34.16 --> 02:51:38.04
He has about, maybe he has eight stores now.

3656
02:51:38.04 --> 02:51:40.24
And I'm in four.

3657
02:51:40.24 --> 02:51:42.64
So you're making bread every day?

3658
02:51:42.64 --> 02:51:43.44
I work, no.

3659
02:51:43.44 --> 02:51:48.04
I work Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.

3660
02:51:48.04 --> 02:51:52.40
And I deliver on Wednesday what I made on Tuesday night

3661
02:51:52.40 --> 02:51:55.28
and sliced Wednesday morning to deliver that.

3662
02:51:55.28 --> 02:51:59.84
Then I work Thursday and deliver that on Friday.

3663
02:51:59.84 --> 02:52:03.08
And then I'm off Saturday, Sunday, Monday.

3664
02:52:03.08 --> 02:52:05.04
But I got another racket gone.

3665
02:52:05.04 --> 02:52:06.84
What's the other racket?

3666
02:52:06.84 --> 02:52:09.24
When I ran for Congress.

3667
02:52:09.24 --> 02:52:10.68
I don't know if you know I did this.

3668
02:52:10.68 --> 02:52:11.60
I did know that, yeah.

3669
02:52:11.60 --> 02:52:12.44
It was in your notes.

3670
02:52:12.44 --> 02:52:15.04
Yeah.

3671
02:52:15.04 --> 02:52:16.24
I was supposed to lose.

3672
02:52:16.24 --> 02:52:18.28
And it was in the gentlemen's agreement.

3673
02:52:18.28 --> 02:52:21.08
You want a guy who can lose gracefully.

3674
02:52:21.08 --> 02:52:23.64
And I said, that's exactly right.

3675
02:52:23.64 --> 02:52:28.48
But I thought to myself, this guy, this Congressman,

3676
02:52:28.48 --> 02:52:29.80
he drinks a lot.

3677
02:52:29.80 --> 02:52:33.72
And he may get hit by a truck or have the classic too much

3678
02:52:33.72 --> 02:52:35.84
alcohol heart attack or something like that.

3679
02:52:35.84 --> 02:52:38.80
This is the only chance I'll ever get.

3680
02:52:38.80 --> 02:52:39.76
So I did.

3681
02:52:39.76 --> 02:52:41.48
I think I put it in there.

3682
02:52:41.48 --> 02:52:43.44
I did rank 10,000 doorbells.

3683
02:52:43.44 --> 02:52:44.40
I really did.

3684
02:52:44.40 --> 02:52:45.96
It gets to be fun after a while.

3685
02:52:45.96 --> 02:52:47.56
You meet new people.

3686
02:52:47.56 --> 02:52:51.20
And moreover, they ask you questions privately

3687
02:52:51.20 --> 02:52:53.60
that you hadn't quite thought through.

3688
02:52:53.60 --> 02:52:55.72
And after you fumble around with that, you say,

3689
02:52:55.72 --> 02:52:58.60
I won't fumble around with that a second time.

3690
02:52:58.60 --> 02:53:00.64
And it turns out, two days later,

3691
02:53:00.64 --> 02:53:02.16
a guy asks you the same question.

3692
02:53:02.16 --> 02:53:02.76
I don't understand.

3693
02:53:02.76 --> 02:53:04.44
You're ready for it.

3694
02:53:04.44 --> 02:53:08.76
So after that, and he spent 10 times what I spent.

3695
02:53:08.76 --> 02:53:13.20
A US Congressman, I was told, will do anything

3696
02:53:13.20 --> 02:53:14.20
to stay in office.

3697
02:53:14.20 --> 02:53:15.64
Anything.

3698
02:53:15.64 --> 02:53:18.44
So at any rate, he spent 10 times what I had to spend.

3699
02:53:18.44 --> 02:53:20.36
I had the $35,000 to spend.

3700
02:53:20.36 --> 02:53:22.64
He spent $350,000.

3701
02:53:22.64 --> 02:53:27.04
But anyway, and he wouldn't debate me either.

3702
02:53:27.04 --> 02:53:31.08
He finally went to this silly thing on,

3703
02:53:31.08 --> 02:53:33.92
he was in DC because he couldn't quite return, which

3704
02:53:33.92 --> 02:53:35.08
is baloney.

3705
02:53:35.08 --> 02:53:38.76
He was from the county north of where we live.

3706
02:53:38.76 --> 02:53:44.08
But at any rate, it wasn't going to say that.

3707
02:53:44.08 --> 02:53:46.56
Well, it had to do with your racket that you're running,

3708
02:53:46.56 --> 02:53:48.92
your other racket.

3709
02:53:48.92 --> 02:53:52.64
Yeah, well, I was stockbroker at that point.

3710
02:53:52.64 --> 02:53:56.76
Because when I had my subdural hematoma,

3711
02:53:56.76 --> 02:54:00.88
they cut a hole in your head to take a piece out of your head.

3712
02:54:00.88 --> 02:54:02.92
Because it slept and fought about that.

3713
02:54:02.92 --> 02:54:06.88
But when I caught in there, you're John Glenn.

3714
02:54:06.88 --> 02:54:09.32
John Glenn fully recovered and so have I.

3715
02:54:09.32 --> 02:54:11.16
But a lot of people don't.

3716
02:54:11.16 --> 02:54:17.04
I think too, it's a matter of wanting to and deciding

3717
02:54:17.04 --> 02:54:18.88
to recover.

3718
02:54:18.88 --> 02:54:21.48
Because with my case, my right side,

3719
02:54:21.48 --> 02:54:22.52
it was on my left side.

3720
02:54:22.52 --> 02:54:25.16
And it's true, your left side didn't work right.

3721
02:54:25.16 --> 02:54:29.28
And it worked a little bit, but not real well.

3722
02:54:29.28 --> 02:54:33.20
And I couldn't walk right and stuff like that.

3723
02:54:33.20 --> 02:54:40.48
Anyway, so at any rate, how'd you get the registrar?

3724
02:54:40.48 --> 02:54:44.68
I am the Pennsylvania registrar for births and deaths

3725
02:54:44.68 --> 02:54:49.52
in only townships, 06 townships, and for several surrounding

3726
02:54:49.52 --> 02:54:50.64
townships.

3727
02:54:50.64 --> 02:54:52.36
If you die, you need a will.

3728
02:54:52.36 --> 02:54:57.000
And to have a will, you need an executor who distributes.

3729
02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:58.36
But you have to prove it.

3730
02:54:58.36 --> 02:54:59.32
Have somebody prove it.

3731
02:54:59.32 --> 02:55:03.80
This guy is dead, not just gone to South America, and so forth.

3732
02:55:03.80 --> 02:55:10.44
So you make certified copies of his death certificate,

3733
02:55:10.44 --> 02:55:14.48
issued generally by the hospital or the corner.

3734
02:55:14.48 --> 02:55:20.24
And that way, your executor, or man or woman's executor,

3735
02:55:20.24 --> 02:55:25.16
can probate the will and so forth and all that.

3736
02:55:25.16 --> 02:55:29.04
So at any rate, a year after, maybe 10 months

3737
02:55:29.04 --> 02:55:33.44
after I lost the election, I get to talk

3738
02:55:33.44 --> 02:55:37.16
to a guy named Bob Asher, who was a little bit of a character

3739
02:55:37.16 --> 02:55:39.52
and well-known in Pennsylvania politics,

3740
02:55:39.52 --> 02:55:42.72
because he took the heat and went to jail for something

3741
02:55:42.72 --> 02:55:48.12
he didn't do, but probably to protect a Pennsylvania senator

3742
02:55:48.12 --> 02:55:50.52
or maybe one of the governors, I don't know.

3743
02:55:50.52 --> 02:55:51.92
But he took the heat and everybody

3744
02:55:51.92 --> 02:55:54.04
agrees that Bob never did anything.

3745
02:55:54.04 --> 02:55:56.76
But he owns a candy company called Asher Candies.

3746
02:55:56.76 --> 02:56:00.72
It's well-known chocolates in Eastern Pennsylvania.

3747
02:56:00.72 --> 02:56:02.56
And there he was at this affair.

3748
02:56:02.56 --> 02:56:05.44
So I went up to him and I said, Bob, you owe me one.

3749
02:56:05.44 --> 02:56:07.08
He said, get out of here.

3750
02:56:07.08 --> 02:56:08.24
I said, you know who I am?

3751
02:56:08.24 --> 02:56:10.80
Oh, I know who you are.

3752
02:56:10.80 --> 02:56:13.88
I said, I rang 10,000 doorbells.

3753
02:56:13.88 --> 02:56:15.96
Yeah, I heard about that.

3754
02:56:15.96 --> 02:56:22.24
I said, he had to spend $350,000 to beat me.

3755
02:56:22.24 --> 02:56:23.88
Yeah.

3756
02:56:23.88 --> 02:56:26.20
Bob, we both know what that means.

3757
02:56:26.20 --> 02:56:29.84
He would have spent $35,000 against the guy in Fayette

3758
02:56:29.84 --> 02:56:34.36
County, he would have spent $58,000 at the guy in Pittsburgh,

3759
02:56:34.36 --> 02:56:40.44
he would have spent $102,000 in the guy in the Harrisburg race.

3760
02:56:40.44 --> 02:56:43.60
He spent it all to beat me.

3761
02:56:43.60 --> 02:56:45.12
Yeah, so what?

3762
02:56:45.12 --> 02:56:48.000
Bob, you owe me one.

3763
02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:51.44
A week later, the local guy that I knew very well

3764
02:56:51.44 --> 02:56:55.88
was a whole political office called me up and he said,

3765
02:56:55.88 --> 02:56:58.80
how'd you like to be a register of will?

3766
02:56:58.80 --> 02:57:02.24
What in the hell is that?

3767
02:57:02.24 --> 02:57:04.68
So I said, yeah, that's right.

3768
02:57:04.68 --> 02:57:06.04
How much does it pay?

3769
02:57:06.04 --> 02:57:08.08
Well, you won't make much.

3770
02:57:08.08 --> 02:57:10.12
You can make $35,000 doing it.

3771
02:57:10.12 --> 02:57:12.44
You can.

3772
02:57:12.44 --> 02:57:15.64
At any rate, they're trying to get rid of the Pennsylvania

3773
02:57:15.64 --> 02:57:16.16
Register.

3774
02:57:16.16 --> 02:57:19.88
Now I'm just sticking on because I figured right down

3775
02:57:19.88 --> 02:57:24.08
to the last day, so at any rate, that's how that happened.

3776
02:57:24.08 --> 02:57:28.64
So I was a stockbroker and if you start late in life

3777
02:57:28.64 --> 02:57:31.40
to be a stockbroker, you don't have much of an account.

3778
02:57:31.40 --> 02:57:35.08
And stuff, and I got to be a certain age

3779
02:57:35.08 --> 02:57:37.60
and I said to my wife, this is not cutting.

3780
02:57:37.60 --> 02:57:38.80
I got to do something else.

3781
02:57:38.80 --> 02:57:42.48
And right after that, my sister-in-law came to me

3782
02:57:42.48 --> 02:57:44.32
and she was German national.

3783
02:57:44.32 --> 02:57:45.04
You wouldn't know it.

3784
02:57:45.04 --> 02:57:46.60
She has zero accent.

3785
02:57:46.60 --> 02:57:51.28
She said, you sell bread that's good enough to sell in Germany.

3786
02:57:51.28 --> 02:57:53.000
You need to do this.

3787
02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:54.52
I'm still doing it by hand.

3788
02:57:54.52 --> 02:57:56.64
And one thing led to another there.

3789
02:57:56.64 --> 02:57:57.88
So that's what I do now.

3790
02:57:57.88 --> 02:58:01.24
And I'll tell you what, keep shit in shape.

3791
02:58:01.24 --> 02:58:04.76
You're not going to get fat doing this unless you want to.

3792
02:58:04.76 --> 02:58:07.72
I suppose you got to make sure you don't get too much of your own product, though.

3793
02:58:07.72 --> 02:58:08.60
That's true.

3794
02:58:08.60 --> 02:58:10.08
Just like the drug dealers.

3795
02:58:10.08 --> 02:58:11.12
No, no, no.

3796
02:58:11.12 --> 02:58:14.20
I say to people, people in the store say, I don't eat much bread.

3797
02:58:14.20 --> 02:58:16.000
I say, it's not the bread.

3798
02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.20
It's what you put on it.

3799
02:58:18.20 --> 02:58:21.68
Too much mayonnaise or too much strawberry jam

3800
02:58:21.68 --> 02:58:25.84
is what you do with it, not the stuff.

3801
02:58:25.84 --> 02:58:29.52
Well, what's the name, so where can people get your bread?

3802
02:58:29.52 --> 02:58:30.60
You got a shipment.

3803
02:58:30.60 --> 02:58:31.16
Oh, I got to.

3804
02:58:31.16 --> 02:58:35.32
I know what I'm not going to be going to the grocery market very often in Pennsylvania.

3805
02:58:35.32 --> 02:58:36.40
The Ole Baker.

3806
02:58:36.40 --> 02:58:37.40
The Ole Baker.

3807
02:58:37.40 --> 02:58:39.08
O-L-E-Y, yeah.

3808
02:58:39.08 --> 02:58:42.92
That's an Indian name for the valley in which we live.

3809
02:58:42.92 --> 02:58:45.88
The Indian name for it was Olinka.

3810
02:58:45.88 --> 02:58:50.92
And that got shortened by the locals at that time way back.

3811
02:58:50.92 --> 02:58:54.000
Benjamin Franklin did not like to come up to that county.

3812
02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.72
He said there were too many Germans up there.

3813
02:58:56.72 --> 02:58:58.68
I don't like to go up there.

3814
02:58:58.68 --> 02:59:01.68
He was a good horseman in his middle age.

3815
02:59:01.68 --> 02:59:04.84
We all see Ben Franklin as a big fat old guy.

3816
02:59:04.84 --> 02:59:05.84
Oh, yeah.

3817
02:59:05.84 --> 02:59:06.84
Fat old man.

3818
02:59:06.84 --> 02:59:10.24
But he was an expert, expert horseman.

3819
02:59:10.24 --> 02:59:13.68
People did not like to travel with him.

3820
02:59:13.68 --> 02:59:20.48
I read an account of him going to York, PA, which is west of Harrisburg.

3821
02:59:20.48 --> 02:59:25.48
I didn't like that with him because he would take off over land to basically explore the

3822
02:59:25.48 --> 02:59:27.40
landscape and whatnot.

3823
02:59:27.40 --> 02:59:32.12
And they were all afraid he was going to either fall off or get killed by the locals,

3824
02:59:32.12 --> 02:59:33.12
the Indians.

3825
02:59:33.12 --> 02:59:38.68
So they thought, and then we're going to have to go look for him and find him.

3826
02:59:38.68 --> 02:59:42.16
Some of the folks out there don't like us very much and so forth.

3827
02:59:42.16 --> 02:59:44.40
So people did not like to go traveling with him.

3828
02:59:44.40 --> 02:59:48.04
But he was an expert and overland horseman.

3829
02:59:48.04 --> 02:59:50.76
We all see him as the fat old guy.

3830
02:59:50.76 --> 02:59:54.72
Yeah, that's the image he got stuck with at some point.

3831
02:59:54.72 --> 03:00:01.88
I know you wrap up your bio that you sent to Dave and it says 2022 still having fun.

3832
03:00:01.88 --> 03:00:02.88
Heck yeah.

3833
03:00:02.88 --> 03:00:03.88
So that's pretty awesome.

3834
03:00:03.88 --> 03:00:04.88
I don't know.

3835
03:00:04.88 --> 03:00:07.72
Did we miss anything?

3836
03:00:07.72 --> 03:00:08.72
Get us up to date?

3837
03:00:08.72 --> 03:00:14.64
There's one thing I thought about it on going by now it escapes me.

3838
03:00:14.64 --> 03:00:15.64
Same marriage.

3839
03:00:15.64 --> 03:00:16.64
Marriage is the same woman.

3840
03:00:16.64 --> 03:00:23.32
And just during the political campaign they would ask you, still married to the same woman

3841
03:00:23.32 --> 03:00:26.32
since age 27.

3842
03:00:26.32 --> 03:00:27.32
Wow.

3843
03:00:27.32 --> 03:00:29.16
So you got married a little bit late.

3844
03:00:29.16 --> 03:00:32.52
And it was your daughter that brought you here and then linked us up.

3845
03:00:32.52 --> 03:00:34.36
I think she linked us up on social media.

3846
03:00:34.36 --> 03:00:37.84
Yeah, it was my elder daughter, Genevieve.

3847
03:00:37.84 --> 03:00:43.76
And she wanted to come with me but she is in a job that she doesn't like and she's

3848
03:00:43.76 --> 03:00:45.80
intensely searching.

3849
03:00:45.80 --> 03:00:50.96
So the other daughter said, I'll take him out and she had not actually said, she said,

3850
03:00:50.96 --> 03:00:53.36
if you go, I'll buy it my own ticket.

3851
03:00:53.36 --> 03:00:54.72
Oh good.

3852
03:00:54.72 --> 03:00:58.16
So then I said to you, I will not travel alone.

3853
03:00:58.16 --> 03:01:00.64
I will travel with my wife.

3854
03:01:00.64 --> 03:01:02.28
Okay.

3855
03:01:02.28 --> 03:01:05.40
So then Pamela said, I don't want to go.

3856
03:01:05.40 --> 03:01:08.80
We have an ancient puppy dog here and she's going to die.

3857
03:01:08.80 --> 03:01:10.80
So we ought to euthanize her.

3858
03:01:10.80 --> 03:01:12.80
I can't do that.

3859
03:01:12.80 --> 03:01:16.76
That's the pragmatic solution apparently.

3860
03:01:16.76 --> 03:01:19.56
So younger daughter said, I'll go with him.

3861
03:01:19.56 --> 03:01:23.76
So she is here today in San Diego.

3862
03:01:23.76 --> 03:01:27.28
And elder daughter is angry.

3863
03:01:27.28 --> 03:01:31.96
But I said, Jenny, what you're doing is more important.

3864
03:01:31.96 --> 03:01:34.40
And she's working it.

3865
03:01:34.40 --> 03:01:40.08
She got into the medical world, most specifically into transplants.

3866
03:01:40.08 --> 03:01:47.28
And she said, if Jaco says anything to you, ask him if he is an organ donor.

3867
03:01:47.28 --> 03:01:50.28
And he said, of course he should be.

3868
03:01:50.28 --> 03:01:51.28
Everybody should be.

3869
03:01:51.28 --> 03:01:52.28
I am.

3870
03:01:52.28 --> 03:01:53.28
Yeah.

3871
03:01:53.28 --> 03:01:54.28
I'll tell her that.

3872
03:01:54.28 --> 03:01:55.28
But anyway.

3873
03:01:55.28 --> 03:01:56.28
She's going to know.

3874
03:01:56.28 --> 03:01:57.28
Apparently everyone's going to know now.

3875
03:01:57.28 --> 03:02:01.76
I said, but the thing about Jenny, the thing that people want is something you can do

3876
03:02:01.76 --> 03:02:03.32
that most people can't.

3877
03:02:03.32 --> 03:02:07.56
You can keep six balls in the air at the same time, so to speak.

3878
03:02:07.56 --> 03:02:12.92
That's why these guys in the transplant business love you so much because they could say, oh,

3879
03:02:12.92 --> 03:02:14.52
I don't know about that.

3880
03:02:14.52 --> 03:02:15.52
Ask Jenny.

3881
03:02:15.52 --> 03:02:16.84
And she had the answer.

3882
03:02:16.84 --> 03:02:22.12
Or this computer thing is screwed up and it's off the thing and it won't work.

3883
03:02:22.12 --> 03:02:23.12
And so call Jenny.

3884
03:02:23.12 --> 03:02:24.12
She can do that.

3885
03:02:24.12 --> 03:02:25.12
And she does.

3886
03:02:25.12 --> 03:02:26.12
There you go.

3887
03:02:26.12 --> 03:02:30.96
So the younger daughter, they have their, she and her husband have their own business.

3888
03:02:30.96 --> 03:02:33.88
So it's easily done for them.

3889
03:02:33.88 --> 03:02:37.04
Although they're very serious and they do well.

3890
03:02:37.04 --> 03:02:39.04
That's the whole thing there.

3891
03:02:39.04 --> 03:02:40.88
There's something else.

3892
03:02:40.88 --> 03:02:43.40
Dave, what do you got?

3893
03:02:43.40 --> 03:02:45.56
I got a lot.

3894
03:02:45.56 --> 03:02:48.000
Oh, I know we're kind of running.

3895
03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.20
I've been taking a lot of notes.

3896
03:02:50.20 --> 03:02:56.52
Um, it just, I'm remarketing how many similarities there are.

3897
03:02:56.52 --> 03:02:57.84
And I just started writing things down.

3898
03:02:57.84 --> 03:02:59.84
I was stationed at Meridian.

3899
03:02:59.84 --> 03:03:02.08
I was stationed at Kingsville.

3900
03:03:02.08 --> 03:03:03.08
I was in LSO.

3901
03:03:03.08 --> 03:03:05.72
I have about 40 traps in the Connie early in my career.

3902
03:03:05.72 --> 03:03:07.24
How about that?

3903
03:03:07.24 --> 03:03:08.24
Yeah.

3904
03:03:08.24 --> 03:03:11.32
I, uh, I did the spin rides in the T2 and I knew her spin instructor.

3905
03:03:11.32 --> 03:03:12.32
I know that well.

3906
03:03:12.32 --> 03:03:13.32
It's fine.

3907
03:03:13.32 --> 03:03:14.88
It's a great, I said, one of those things.

3908
03:03:14.88 --> 03:03:16.20
I said, it's great carnival ride.

3909
03:03:16.20 --> 03:03:17.20
He's a good carnival ride.

3910
03:03:17.20 --> 03:03:18.20
But so many guys would not do it.

3911
03:03:18.20 --> 03:03:21.80
And I used to say that the student didn't know who I was.

3912
03:03:21.80 --> 03:03:25.08
I'll, I'll be doing your spin hop today.

3913
03:03:25.08 --> 03:03:26.08
You're terrified.

3914
03:03:26.08 --> 03:03:29.84
Well, no, Mr. Copel, but I thought that, I said, wait a minute, wait a minute.

3915
03:03:29.84 --> 03:03:32.92
How many guys have you punched out on spin hops?

3916
03:03:32.92 --> 03:03:35.24
Oh, I don't know.

3917
03:03:35.24 --> 03:03:36.84
No one.

3918
03:03:36.84 --> 03:03:41.000
It's a carnival ride and so forth.

3919
03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:44.64
And Fred didn't want to, I, that gives me, I don't like to do that.

3920
03:03:44.64 --> 03:03:45.64
I'll do them.

3921
03:03:45.64 --> 03:03:46.64
I'll do them for you.

3922
03:03:46.64 --> 03:03:48.96
So I would do a lot of spin hops in Meridian.

3923
03:03:48.96 --> 03:03:51.40
It's a carnival ride.

3924
03:03:51.40 --> 03:03:54.68
Not much instruction goes on that day except for the route.

3925
03:03:54.68 --> 03:04:01.20
All right, Mr. Smith, we established the direction of rotation and we will positively

3926
03:04:01.20 --> 03:04:07.32
neutralize the controls and then apply full opposite rudder.

3927
03:04:07.32 --> 03:04:14.08
And when the rotation stops, we will stick full forward and so forth.

3928
03:04:14.08 --> 03:04:15.76
Yeah, that's all you do.

3929
03:04:15.76 --> 03:04:17.16
And then, okay, fine.

3930
03:04:17.16 --> 03:04:18.16
We got that.

3931
03:04:18.16 --> 03:04:19.16
Now we're going to climb back up.

3932
03:04:19.16 --> 03:04:20.16
You have to do it again.

3933
03:04:20.16 --> 03:04:24.92
Yeah, I'm going to do it again too.

3934
03:04:24.92 --> 03:04:25.92
I remember it well.

3935
03:04:25.92 --> 03:04:29.68
It's one of the best rides ever.

3936
03:04:29.68 --> 03:04:33.52
My time with the Air Force and then you kind of conclude with a couple of things that just

3937
03:04:33.52 --> 03:04:37.56
could help make the connection to living on the O3 level in the state room underneath

3938
03:04:37.56 --> 03:04:38.56
the catapults.

3939
03:04:38.56 --> 03:04:45.24
And then, God forbid, I am on a podcast where I don't have to say something nice about Navy

3940
03:04:45.24 --> 03:04:52.84
Seals, but you work for a frogman and got to see what real good leadership looked like.

3941
03:04:52.84 --> 03:04:53.84
But you know what?

3942
03:04:53.84 --> 03:04:56.68
He, let's talk about leadership just a second.

3943
03:04:56.68 --> 03:05:02.48
He was not well thought of, mostly by the younger guys who are ROs in the fleet squad

3944
03:05:02.48 --> 03:05:03.48
or not was in.

3945
03:05:03.48 --> 03:05:04.68
He never does anything.

3946
03:05:04.68 --> 03:05:09.24
He would talk and they would say not nice things about him.

3947
03:05:09.24 --> 03:05:11.80
I don't think any of the front seat guys said that.

3948
03:05:11.80 --> 03:05:13.76
What a surprise.

3949
03:05:13.76 --> 03:05:20.32
But the back seat guys, they're all young and Lieutenant Junior Grades, all of them

3950
03:05:20.32 --> 03:05:21.32
solid.

3951
03:05:21.32 --> 03:05:22.52
And most of them retired as commanders.

3952
03:05:22.52 --> 03:05:27.60
I don't know what the heck they got them to do to say in the Navy that long, but at

3953
03:05:27.60 --> 03:05:31.36
any rate, they didn't like him because they couldn't understand what he was doing.

3954
03:05:31.36 --> 03:05:35.52
I think the front seat guys all really understood what was going on there.

3955
03:05:35.52 --> 03:05:39.000
Well, I think there's a real strong connection between pilots and Seals.

3956
03:05:39.000 --> 03:05:41.08
I got to learn that firsthand working with Jaco.

3957
03:05:41.08 --> 03:05:47.80
But you did it at a time where you didn't have the machines that we had.

3958
03:05:47.80 --> 03:05:51.60
I mean, you flew an airplane that I guarantee you was infinitely harder than it was for

3959
03:05:51.60 --> 03:05:52.60
me.

3960
03:05:52.60 --> 03:05:59.20
But it occurred to me that the legacy that I got to live under the 35 years of history

3961
03:05:59.20 --> 03:06:01.92
was written about people like you.

3962
03:06:01.92 --> 03:06:06.52
When I got in the Navy, the Marine Corps, how we flew fighters and the way we taught

3963
03:06:06.52 --> 03:06:10.16
people to fly fighters was already embedded.

3964
03:06:10.16 --> 03:06:12.16
And that all started with your generation.

3965
03:06:12.16 --> 03:06:15.96
But that's what I was thinking about in that.

3966
03:06:15.96 --> 03:06:18.64
Dan Patterson and the book.

3967
03:06:18.64 --> 03:06:25.08
That wasn't called Top Gun until maybe, I don't know, three, four, five years later.

3968
03:06:25.08 --> 03:06:26.08
Somebody said Top Gun.

3969
03:06:26.08 --> 03:06:28.08
But the F-4 didn't have a gun.

3970
03:06:28.08 --> 03:06:32.08
And I don't, and all your newspaper guys, they say, I had to have a gun.

3971
03:06:32.08 --> 03:06:35.08
And then finally did the F-4E and had a gun.

3972
03:06:35.08 --> 03:06:40.20
And then finally, no, the missile was a better weapon every time, every time.

3973
03:06:40.20 --> 03:06:44.76
You had to be within 3,000 feet to do anything with a 20-millimeter gun.

3974
03:06:44.76 --> 03:06:46.36
I shot the gun at Kingsville.

3975
03:06:46.36 --> 03:06:48.92
We all did, I was bad at it too.

3976
03:06:48.92 --> 03:06:51.24
I don't know.

3977
03:06:51.24 --> 03:06:57.20
They put your colored paint on your, and then they examined the banner.

3978
03:06:57.20 --> 03:06:59.16
There are no greens on here.

3979
03:06:59.16 --> 03:07:00.92
What happened to you, Tom?

3980
03:07:00.92 --> 03:07:03.08
And embarrassing, you know?

3981
03:07:03.08 --> 03:07:04.08
I'm an older guy.

3982
03:07:04.08 --> 03:07:06.000
I'm supposed to have holes in there.

3983
03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:13.96
But at any rate, I don't, I utterly disagree with that business about if any sort of a

3984
03:07:13.96 --> 03:07:16.56
fire plane had to have a gun, a ball of the lone.

3985
03:07:16.56 --> 03:07:22.32
Now early on, sparrows didn't work because White Hat Sailors would drop them and chuck

3986
03:07:22.32 --> 03:07:24.36
them up into the bottom of the airplane.

3987
03:07:24.36 --> 03:07:29.72
And they didn't test them to make sure this is working and things like that.

3988
03:07:29.72 --> 03:07:33.88
And then the aviators didn't turn the panel on and to see if the missiles, they called

3989
03:07:33.88 --> 03:07:38.04
it toony, that the missiles would tune and things like that.

3990
03:07:38.04 --> 03:07:43.68
And then if one didn't tune, you could flip past that to go to the number two.

3991
03:07:43.68 --> 03:07:44.68
And so forth.

3992
03:07:44.68 --> 03:07:45.68
And fire that one.

3993
03:07:45.68 --> 03:07:46.68
Forget about the first one.

3994
03:07:46.68 --> 03:07:53.76
But then you could do one more thing that came out during Top Gun that nobody, during

3995
03:07:53.76 --> 03:07:59.80
Advanced Fighter Weapons School, if you went to Borsight, tell the guy in back, cock me,

3996
03:07:59.80 --> 03:08:01.32
go to Borsight.

3997
03:08:01.32 --> 03:08:07.36
The antenna goes where the pepper is, through the 35-mil gun sight is looking.

3998
03:08:07.36 --> 03:08:09.32
They're both looking at the same place.

3999
03:08:09.32 --> 03:08:11.52
And that's what I was going to do with the 21.

4000
03:08:11.52 --> 03:08:13.88
Go Borsight, pull the trigger.

4001
03:08:13.88 --> 03:08:19.44
And you get a sparrow, which is a monster missile that weighs 500 pounds.

4002
03:08:19.44 --> 03:08:20.44
A sparrow.

4003
03:08:20.44 --> 03:08:25.28
The ones we had anyway, the E-Models weighed 500 pounds.

4004
03:08:25.28 --> 03:08:30.04
But anyway, it wasn't called Fighter Weapons School back then.

4005
03:08:30.04 --> 03:08:31.04
Oh yeah.

4006
03:08:31.04 --> 03:08:38.000
So the thing you read in Dan Pedersen's book, who remains a nice guy.

4007
03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:44.80
But I would say this to him in a clear way, most of the airplanes shot down in World War

4008
03:08:44.80 --> 03:08:53.04
I, in World War II, in Korean War, in the Vietnam War, never saw the guy that shot them

4009
03:08:53.04 --> 03:08:54.04
down.

4010
03:08:54.04 --> 03:08:56.48
They never saw the missile that shot them down.

4011
03:08:56.48 --> 03:09:06.24
I know, I knew, guys who came out feet wet out of North Vietnam and saw the missile go

4012
03:09:06.24 --> 03:09:07.48
by.

4013
03:09:07.48 --> 03:09:12.32
The B-Model missiles, the missile the Russians had, they stole it from us and shipped it

4014
03:09:12.32 --> 03:09:16.56
through Berlin on commercial freight.

4015
03:09:16.56 --> 03:09:18.40
And it didn't guide that well.

4016
03:09:18.40 --> 03:09:20.56
At least the Russian version of it didn't.

4017
03:09:20.56 --> 03:09:25.88
It had a big seeker head on it and it didn't narrow its sight.

4018
03:09:25.88 --> 03:09:31.56
But I talked with guys who said, I saw the missile go by and I had no idea.

4019
03:09:31.56 --> 03:09:35.40
Holy smoke.

4020
03:09:35.40 --> 03:09:42.40
These guys who got shot down, and I heard this early in the cruise, not until I was

4021
03:09:42.40 --> 03:09:49.84
out there and you get fully realized that they're used real bullets here and stuff.

4022
03:09:49.84 --> 03:09:58.48
Most 95% of the airplanes that got shot down, get shot down and they never saw the guy,

4023
03:09:58.48 --> 03:09:59.68
whatever did it to them.

4024
03:09:59.68 --> 03:10:01.08
They never saw it.

4025
03:10:01.08 --> 03:10:07.92
One time we were in Laos somewhere, it doesn't matter where, waiting for the fact.

4026
03:10:07.92 --> 03:10:10.68
And he's at 14 on the 15.

4027
03:10:10.68 --> 03:10:14.60
He's in a port orbit and I'm in a starboard orbit.

4028
03:10:14.60 --> 03:10:17.08
We're just waiting quietly.

4029
03:10:17.08 --> 03:10:21.72
And here comes an F-4.

4030
03:10:21.72 --> 03:10:27.16
You can tell because it has at the wing roots and the leading edge, it has two flashing white

4031
03:10:27.16 --> 03:10:28.16
lights.

4032
03:10:28.16 --> 03:10:35.32
That's an F-4 and he comes flying by and he gets about where we are.

4033
03:10:35.32 --> 03:10:38.56
That's where there are guns on the ground because that's where there are truck parking

4034
03:10:38.56 --> 03:10:40.60
and that's where the fact is going to meet us.

4035
03:10:40.60 --> 03:10:44.40
And those gunners can hear us up overhead.

4036
03:10:44.40 --> 03:10:50.92
But here comes this guy over the horizon, an F-4.

4037
03:10:50.92 --> 03:10:58.76
That's this guy, probably 57 at least, maybe 85mm and he's still got his lights on bright

4038
03:10:58.76 --> 03:11:00.52
and flash.

4039
03:11:00.52 --> 03:11:04.68
And he disappeared over the horizon, bright and flash.

4040
03:11:04.68 --> 03:11:05.96
Did you get close to him?

4041
03:11:05.96 --> 03:11:09.36
I'm not that close because they were shooting at him but I went close enough.

4042
03:11:09.36 --> 03:11:10.36
I can see that.

4043
03:11:10.36 --> 03:11:12.44
It's an Air Force F-4.

4044
03:11:12.44 --> 03:11:16.44
Not some Navy guy who's lost or something.

4045
03:11:16.44 --> 03:11:20.12
It's Air Force F-4.

4046
03:11:20.12 --> 03:11:22.92
And he never knew it.

4047
03:11:22.92 --> 03:11:26.20
Oblivious to everything with his lights on bright and flash.

4048
03:11:26.20 --> 03:11:27.88
That's a true story.

4049
03:11:27.88 --> 03:11:34.52
So my point here is that Top Gun is, or what they call now Top Gun, is very interesting

4050
03:11:34.52 --> 03:11:35.52
if you go one on one.

4051
03:11:35.52 --> 03:11:40.80
You both start from here, you turn and start with a head on pass and so forth.

4052
03:11:40.80 --> 03:11:43.76
One guy is better than the other and he gets behind the other.

4053
03:11:43.76 --> 03:11:45.88
But that's not what happens.

4054
03:11:45.88 --> 03:11:51.48
What happens is the guy that you were picking your nose for some reason or other and the

4055
03:11:51.48 --> 03:11:56.76
MiG-21 showed up or a MiG-26 or God knows what it is and he shot you down from three

4056
03:11:56.76 --> 03:12:00.48
miles a stern because you were picking your nose.

4057
03:12:00.48 --> 03:12:04.08
You got to be a wild man in that cockpit if you don't want to get shot down.

4058
03:12:04.08 --> 03:12:09.86
You got to know everything that's going on, 360 degrees all the time.

4059
03:12:09.86 --> 03:12:13.84
So you turn into a crazy man and you fly with a new RO.

4060
03:12:13.84 --> 03:12:15.28
He said, you're really nuts.

4061
03:12:15.28 --> 03:12:17.28
I'm still here too.

4062
03:12:17.28 --> 03:12:20.32
That's all I got, man.

4063
03:12:20.32 --> 03:12:22.60
So at any rate, I beg your pardon, I interrupted you.

4064
03:12:22.60 --> 03:12:23.60
Not at all.

4065
03:12:23.60 --> 03:12:26.72
That's probably a great place to wrap it up right there.

4066
03:12:26.72 --> 03:12:27.72
All right.

4067
03:12:27.72 --> 03:12:30.96
That's a great attitude to have.

4068
03:12:30.96 --> 03:12:32.60
Thank you so much for coming out here.

4069
03:12:32.60 --> 03:12:33.60
It was fun.

4070
03:12:33.60 --> 03:12:34.60
Really appreciate it.

4071
03:12:34.60 --> 03:12:35.60
It was very young.

4072
03:12:35.60 --> 03:12:41.12
Thanks for sharing your experiences, lessons learned and of course, most important, thank

4073
03:12:41.12 --> 03:12:42.12
you for your service.

4074
03:12:42.12 --> 03:12:43.12
Oh, bologna.

4075
03:12:43.12 --> 03:12:44.12
So, to your show.

4076
03:12:44.12 --> 03:12:48.40
Thank you for being in the Air Force and your service in the Navy.

4077
03:12:48.40 --> 03:12:51.88
And most of all, thank you for your service to our great nation.

4078
03:12:51.88 --> 03:12:52.88
Amen.

4079
03:12:52.88 --> 03:12:55.12
Thank you, sir.

4080
03:12:55.12 --> 03:13:01.08
And with that, Tom Copel has left the building.

4081
03:13:01.08 --> 03:13:09.52
Pretty awesome to hear from a dude that, as you were telling me before we hit record,

4082
03:13:09.52 --> 03:13:17.24
in the middle of the Vietnam War, just volunteers to go and fly, you know, F4 Phantoms.

4083
03:13:17.24 --> 03:13:19.56
That's the pipeline too.

4084
03:13:19.56 --> 03:13:21.56
So pretty amazing to hear these guys.

4085
03:13:21.56 --> 03:13:25.84
I thought it was actually pretty interesting about the nuclear war stuff too.

4086
03:13:25.84 --> 03:13:26.84
Yeah.

4087
03:13:26.84 --> 03:13:30.20
You know, like, what, what, what are you thinking?

4088
03:13:30.20 --> 03:13:34.44
What you, you know, I was in the SEAL teams and I was like, Hey, we might do a mission.

4089
03:13:34.44 --> 03:13:39.84
In the 90s, like, Hey, we might do a mission Michael, you know, kill a terrorist.

4090
03:13:39.84 --> 03:13:42.56
This dude's like, Hey, we might go and end humanity.

4091
03:13:42.56 --> 03:13:43.56
Yeah.

4092
03:13:43.56 --> 03:13:48.92
You know, that's a, I remember when I first started flying airplanes, what you really

4093
03:13:48.92 --> 03:13:51.32
want to do is you actually want to, you want to do something.

4094
03:13:51.32 --> 03:13:53.36
You want to drop a bomb, you want to get in a fight.

4095
03:13:53.36 --> 03:13:55.04
That's what you want to do.

4096
03:13:55.04 --> 03:13:56.68
And there's a double edge to that.

4097
03:13:56.68 --> 03:13:59.76
Because you know, like, well, I mean, we don't want to go to war.

4098
03:13:59.76 --> 03:14:00.76
It's not a good thing.

4099
03:14:00.76 --> 03:14:03.24
But if you do, you like, you want to get the call.

4100
03:14:03.24 --> 03:14:07.64
The only thing you're ever going to do when you're, you know, strategic air command with

4101
03:14:07.64 --> 03:14:09.88
nuclear weapons at a B 52, you get that call.

4102
03:14:09.88 --> 03:14:13.88
Like that's a different psychology about what your job is.

4103
03:14:13.88 --> 03:14:17.72
You know, and I could see someone like him getting pretty restless doing strip alert

4104
03:14:17.72 --> 03:14:21.08
all day, knowing it's kind of unlikely.

4105
03:14:21.08 --> 03:14:24.16
And if it did work out, like, what are you actually doing there?

4106
03:14:24.16 --> 03:14:26.48
That's not a scenario you want to be in, no matter what.

4107
03:14:26.48 --> 03:14:27.48
So yeah.

4108
03:14:27.48 --> 03:14:28.48
Crazy.

4109
03:14:28.48 --> 03:14:31.000
But anyways, thanks for listening.

4110
03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:37.16
If you want to support the podcast, you want to support yourself, get yourself some jocwafield.com.

4111
03:14:37.16 --> 03:14:41.04
You can get these, these drinks we're drinking right here.

4112
03:14:41.04 --> 03:14:43.96
Get yourself some afterburner orange.

4113
03:14:43.96 --> 03:14:46.36
The tasty flavor.

4114
03:14:46.36 --> 03:14:49.24
Moke going ham on the milk we got.

4115
03:14:49.24 --> 03:14:51.80
We got ready to drink milk now.

4116
03:14:51.80 --> 03:14:54.68
People are kind of going crazy with that stuff.

4117
03:14:54.68 --> 03:14:57.84
I'll tell you what's what I find.

4118
03:14:57.84 --> 03:15:05.68
I look just like every other freaking American, the convenience of just cracking one of those

4119
03:15:05.68 --> 03:15:07.56
open and drinking it.

4120
03:15:07.56 --> 03:15:13.72
Look, how much effort is it for me to get out my, get out my milk, get out my shaker,

4121
03:15:13.72 --> 03:15:20.72
put my mulk in there, shake it, you know, that has to take me at least three minutes.

4122
03:15:20.72 --> 03:15:25.36
Or I got that little ready to drink hitter just ready to, you know, take some.

4123
03:15:25.36 --> 03:15:29.88
The other thing I find about it is you can just do, you can, it's so effortless that

4124
03:15:29.88 --> 03:15:30.88
you can just open one up.

4125
03:15:30.88 --> 03:15:35.76
Like I have, I have a part of my fridge where I have one of each kind of opened where I'll

4126
03:15:35.76 --> 03:15:39.76
just go like take a sip, take maybe two or three sips, you know, just during the day,

4127
03:15:39.76 --> 03:15:41.76
just to fly by.

4128
03:15:41.76 --> 03:15:44.72
So there you go.

4129
03:15:44.72 --> 03:15:48.16
Mulk, all the joint stuff, you know what, you know what it is.

4130
03:15:48.16 --> 03:15:50.04
You can get it, jocwafield.com.

4131
03:15:50.04 --> 03:15:54.68
You can get it at the Wawa, get the drinks at Wawa, get it vitamin shop.

4132
03:15:54.68 --> 03:15:55.68
You'll get some support.

4133
03:15:55.68 --> 03:15:56.68
Origin USA.

4134
03:15:56.68 --> 03:16:06.16
I saw Cam Haynes today posted, Cam is teaching Tulsi Gabbard how to shoot a bow and they're

4135
03:16:06.16 --> 03:16:08.04
wearing origin hunt.

4136
03:16:08.04 --> 03:16:09.12
How legit is that?

4137
03:16:09.12 --> 03:16:10.24
Pretty awesome.

4138
03:16:10.24 --> 03:16:12.96
So check out origin USA.com.

4139
03:16:12.96 --> 03:16:15.44
We're making stuff in America.

4140
03:16:15.44 --> 03:16:24.24
Jeans, jujitsu, geese, boots, t-shirts, rash guards, all 100% made in America.

4141
03:16:24.24 --> 03:16:27.92
So, get some of that.

4142
03:16:27.92 --> 03:16:29.76
We got a store.

4143
03:16:29.76 --> 03:16:31.40
Echo called it Joclostore.

4144
03:16:31.40 --> 03:16:33.28
It's joclostore.com.

4145
03:16:33.28 --> 03:16:34.28
Get t-shirts.

4146
03:16:34.28 --> 03:16:35.28
Where you wearing?

4147
03:16:35.28 --> 03:16:36.28
Oh, that's a legit one.

4148
03:16:36.28 --> 03:16:41.000
So Dave, right now if you're not on YouTube, Dave's wearing the Seawolves t-shirts, 1966

4149
03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:42.92
to 1972.

4150
03:16:42.92 --> 03:16:50.88
The only aviation unit ever commissioned and decommissioned in a combat zone.

4151
03:16:50.88 --> 03:16:52.52
We've had some Seawolves on the podcast.

4152
03:16:52.52 --> 03:16:56.08
There's a t-shirt to represent the Seawolves.

4153
03:16:56.08 --> 03:16:59.28
You can get that at joclostore.com.

4154
03:16:59.28 --> 03:17:03.52
We also got rash guards and hats and beanies and all that kind of stuff.

4155
03:17:03.52 --> 03:17:06.40
The shirt locker.

4156
03:17:06.40 --> 03:17:17.28
Shirt lockers, it's a little opportunity for us to express kind of, let's say some deep

4157
03:17:17.28 --> 03:17:20.04
layers to the podcast.

4158
03:17:20.04 --> 03:17:24.08
And it's a subscription thing, get a shirt a month and they're cool.

4159
03:17:24.08 --> 03:17:25.96
We got this podcast, subscribe to it.

4160
03:17:25.96 --> 03:17:26.96
Jockel Underground.

4161
03:17:26.96 --> 03:17:33.72
We're doing the Underground podcast, which is also a platform that we have that we control.

4162
03:17:33.72 --> 03:17:39.04
Because if you're not in control of a platform, you should be nervous that they could kick

4163
03:17:39.04 --> 03:17:40.52
you off that platform.

4164
03:17:40.52 --> 03:17:42.16
So I was nervous about that.

4165
03:17:42.16 --> 03:17:43.64
Now, look, I'm not trying to get kicked off.

4166
03:17:43.64 --> 03:17:45.56
I don't think I'm gonna get kicked off.

4167
03:17:45.56 --> 03:17:48.000
We're not getting crazy over here.

4168
03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:55.60
But there's certain things I've said that have been demonetized.

4169
03:17:55.60 --> 03:17:59.44
So who knows when they're gonna say, yeah, you can't say that anymore.

4170
03:17:59.44 --> 03:18:01.68
So we have our own platform, jockelunderground.com.

4171
03:18:01.68 --> 03:18:06.92
Check that out, YouTube channel.

4172
03:18:06.92 --> 03:18:09.76
Jockel podcast is the YouTube channel.

4173
03:18:09.76 --> 03:18:11.48
OriginUSA also has a YouTube channel.

4174
03:18:11.48 --> 03:18:12.48
We got psychological warfare.

4175
03:18:12.48 --> 03:18:15.28
We got flip side canvas, Dakota Meyer.

4176
03:18:15.28 --> 03:18:21.04
Got a bunch of books, Only Cry for the Living by Holly McKay.

4177
03:18:21.04 --> 03:18:22.04
Final spin.

4178
03:18:22.04 --> 03:18:27.16
The audiobook of Final Spin, Dave and I did like a Q&A from Final Spin.

4179
03:18:27.16 --> 03:18:28.88
So after the book, you can do the Q&A.

4180
03:18:28.88 --> 03:18:30.48
You can listen to that Q&A.

4181
03:18:30.48 --> 03:18:32.44
Pretty cool.

4182
03:18:32.44 --> 03:18:35.48
The background of where it came from.

4183
03:18:35.48 --> 03:18:37.36
I can tell you where it's going.

4184
03:18:37.36 --> 03:18:39.16
That thing's making moves.

4185
03:18:39.16 --> 03:18:41.88
I'll leave it at that for now, because it's hard to get these things done.

4186
03:18:41.88 --> 03:18:48.48
Anyways, I've written a bunch of books, Warrior Kid books.

4187
03:18:48.48 --> 03:18:51.36
Just of I have a gym, Victory MMA and Fitness.

4188
03:18:51.36 --> 03:18:56.08
Just about every day a parent will come up to me and say, thank you for those books.

4189
03:18:56.08 --> 03:18:58.84
That got my kid to focus in school.

4190
03:18:58.84 --> 03:19:03.60
Got my kid here to start training, got my kid to stop eating junk.

4191
03:19:03.60 --> 03:19:06.44
So check out those books for your kids.

4192
03:19:06.44 --> 03:19:09.84
Way of the Warrior Kid series.

4193
03:19:09.84 --> 03:19:15.40
Mikey and the Dragons, Hackworth, About Face, Extreme Ownership, Dicotomy, Leadership,

4194
03:19:15.40 --> 03:19:16.40
all these books.

4195
03:19:16.40 --> 03:19:17.72
You know, I've written them.

4196
03:19:17.72 --> 03:19:18.72
Get them if you want them.

4197
03:19:18.72 --> 03:19:19.72
Ashland Front.

4198
03:19:19.72 --> 03:19:20.88
What's Ashland Front, Dave Burke?

4199
03:19:20.88 --> 03:19:27.12
Ashland Front is our leadership consultancy, where we, you, me, Leif and the whole team

4200
03:19:27.12 --> 03:19:31.64
get to actually in person, live talk about every single leadership principle you've been

4201
03:19:31.64 --> 03:19:33.96
talking about on this podcast and in the book.

4202
03:19:33.96 --> 03:19:37.08
We get to do it with companies and people all the time.

4203
03:19:37.08 --> 03:19:38.08
It's awesome.

4204
03:19:38.08 --> 03:19:39.08
And what about the Academy?

4205
03:19:39.08 --> 03:19:40.72
Oh, the Academy.

4206
03:19:40.72 --> 03:19:41.96
The Extreme Ownership Academy.

4207
03:19:41.96 --> 03:19:46.52
It turns out that meeting people live and in person isn't always the most convenient

4208
03:19:46.52 --> 03:19:50.28
way to do it and bringing people off the line or bringing people into a conference room

4209
03:19:50.28 --> 03:19:53.20
or a classroom every single day is not a great way to train.

4210
03:19:53.20 --> 03:19:54.92
We want to keep people working.

4211
03:19:54.92 --> 03:19:58.72
But the Academy takes basically everything we teach, puts it online so you can get to

4212
03:19:58.72 --> 03:20:01.20
it whenever and however you want to.

4213
03:20:01.20 --> 03:20:03.32
And it's an awesome additional resource.

4214
03:20:03.32 --> 03:20:07.56
It's basically being able to hit that leadership gym every day whenever it's convenient for

4215
03:20:07.56 --> 03:20:08.56
you.

4216
03:20:08.56 --> 03:20:09.56
Yeah.

4217
03:20:09.56 --> 03:20:12.44
Just like Jiu Jitsu, there's moves you got to learn.

4218
03:20:12.44 --> 03:20:15.72
There's moves you've got to learn about leadership.

4219
03:20:15.72 --> 03:20:19.12
And just like Jiu Jitsu, you can't just look at a move and hear it one time and be like,

4220
03:20:19.12 --> 03:20:21.60
oh, I'll throw this, oh, my plot on somebody now.

4221
03:20:21.60 --> 03:20:23.24
This is not going to work.

4222
03:20:23.24 --> 03:20:25.32
You got to fully understand it.

4223
03:20:25.32 --> 03:20:26.52
You got to see it from different angles.

4224
03:20:26.52 --> 03:20:27.84
You got to try it yourself.

4225
03:20:27.84 --> 03:20:31.88
And that's what the Academy is, extremeownership.com.

4226
03:20:31.88 --> 03:20:36.000
If you want to get in on that and if you want to help service members active and retired,

4227
03:20:36.000 --> 03:20:41.56
you want to help their families, you want to help Gold Star families, check out Mark

4228
03:20:41.56 --> 03:20:42.56
Lee's mom, mom of each.

4229
03:20:42.56 --> 03:20:48.56
She's got a charity organization, does incredible stuff, does incredible stuff, takes service

4230
03:20:48.56 --> 03:20:49.56
members.

4231
03:20:49.56 --> 03:20:51.96
This is one of the things that she does.

4232
03:20:51.96 --> 03:20:57.76
She takes service members who have significant health issues and she gets them treatment.

4233
03:20:57.76 --> 03:20:59.44
It's a multifaceted treatment.

4234
03:20:59.44 --> 03:21:01.92
One of the big treatments is hyperbaric chambers.

4235
03:21:01.92 --> 03:21:05.000
You're going in, ride in the O2.

4236
03:21:05.000 --> 03:21:11.12
She sets this up for like 30 or 45 days, all expenses paid.

4237
03:21:11.12 --> 03:21:15.000
We've seen the results of this is just outstanding.

4238
03:21:15.000 --> 03:21:20.24
So if you want to donate or you want to support that, go to americasmightywarriors.org.

4239
03:21:20.24 --> 03:21:28.64
And also don't forget about Micah Fink, who's taken vets up into the wilderness to heal

4240
03:21:28.64 --> 03:21:32.64
through adversity, which is pretty awesome.

4241
03:21:32.64 --> 03:21:35.72
Use and horses.org.

4242
03:21:35.72 --> 03:21:43.12
And if you want to follow us on Twitter, on Graham, on the Facebook, Dave is at DavidRBerke.

4243
03:21:43.12 --> 03:21:44.12
I'm at Jocker-Willink.

4244
03:21:44.12 --> 03:21:46.72
Watch out for the algorithm.

4245
03:21:46.72 --> 03:21:52.48
Thanks once again to Tom Copel for making the trip out, for sharing those experiences

4246
03:21:52.48 --> 03:21:56.24
and lessons learned from your life.

4247
03:21:56.24 --> 03:22:00.68
Pretty neat to hear this stuff first person.

4248
03:22:00.68 --> 03:22:02.76
Thanks for your service.

4249
03:22:02.76 --> 03:22:03.96
Thanks for coming out.

4250
03:22:03.96 --> 03:22:10.16
And thanks to all our military personnel with special recognition today to those of you

4251
03:22:10.16 --> 03:22:15.20
that help us own the skies, the pilots, the navigators, the air crews, the maintenance

4252
03:22:15.20 --> 03:22:21.44
and mechanics on the ground and the thousands of support people that make our domination

4253
03:22:21.44 --> 03:22:23.84
of the air possible.

4254
03:22:23.84 --> 03:22:26.40
Thank you for what you all do.

4255
03:22:26.40 --> 03:22:32.000
Thanks as well to our police, law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

4256
03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:36.16
correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, all first responders.

4257
03:22:36.16 --> 03:22:42.28
Thanks for what you do here on the home front to keep us safe.

4258
03:22:42.28 --> 03:22:51.20
And I want to close this out with another quote, a quote from Captain David McCamble,

4259
03:22:51.20 --> 03:22:53.40
United States Navy.

4260
03:22:53.40 --> 03:23:01.72
34 air victories in World War II, the most of any US Navy pilot ever.

4261
03:23:01.72 --> 03:23:09.88
And he said this quote, aggressiveness was a fundamental to success in air to air combat.

4262
03:23:09.88 --> 03:23:15.56
And if you ever caught a fighter pilot in a defensive mood, you had him licked before

4263
03:23:15.56 --> 03:23:18.08
you started shooting.

4264
03:23:18.08 --> 03:23:20.28
End quote.

4265
03:23:20.28 --> 03:23:22.32
So there you go.

4266
03:23:22.32 --> 03:23:24.80
That just doesn't apply to air to air combat.

4267
03:23:24.80 --> 03:23:26.52
It applies to everything.

4268
03:23:26.52 --> 03:23:28.48
That's how you win.

4269
03:23:28.48 --> 03:23:33.72
So get out there, be aggressive, make things happen.

4270
03:23:33.72 --> 03:23:37.68
And of course, keep getting after it.

4271
03:23:37.68 --> 03:23:41.000
And until next time, this is Dave N'Jocko.

4272
03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:52.72
Out.
