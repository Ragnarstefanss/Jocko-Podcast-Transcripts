One I think my street smart's growing up in Detroit you know and being able to talk to the lingo and look the part you know and life unfortunately a lot of times when you first go in a situation especially criminals they're going to size you up they're going to say this this individual look like they know what they're doing can I trust this person you know but a lot of times these people that are working for us they're risking their life and they have to feel confident that you're going to do your best to protect them and I also learned never promise somebody something you can't deliver you know don't promise them well you know you work a couple weeks and you get a couple you know I can make all your charges go away it's not up it's not up to the agents you know you have to bring their cooperation attention to the prosecutor which then brings it to the judge and you know those decisions are made then and also treat people like a people a person you know you don't have to start you know indeed so you end up going on deployment to Afghanistan your first deployment how's that it's some intense every time we go to Afghanistan things are a little different and at the time we were doing a lot of work with the Army ODA's the Green Braise there and at this particular time we were operating in Panjoe area you know the Panjoe of Canada area is kind of the first place of Taliban where there's a lot of in search and activity but also a lot of heroin production going on there also so they broke us up into like two z's and three z's input us with different units and a good partner of mine friend of mine Travis Brooks and myself we were assigned with first special forces group over there ODA 1231 and they were stationed in Cancemins this little little base outside of Canada Airfield which is like our main bases that can't be had our airfield in Afghanistan we were living with the ODA the first group guys you know and we would bring like I said earlier our expertise investigations and we had our partner force over there which we were mentoring and we were living over there with the Green Braise and using our intel information you know from the DEA and also using the military information and we would try to pair that information find out where the bigger drug labs were where they were selling the chemicals and equipment to manufacture heroin and we would not go after is the opion farmers the Poppy farmers because a lot of times they were made to grow the opion you know the Taliban came in and they had the biggest stick at the time either you know you're growing this Poppy force or you're can killed you know so a lot of the individuals who sold and made money out of the effedrant in pseudo-fedron were middle eastern individuals so of course you know they were like you know you know get all your middle eastern informants and see if they have any terrorist activity and we had a lot DEA had a lot of middle eating you know with the drugs in the pseudo-fedron so FBI then wanted to come over started to brief in our informants you know about terror it terrorist related activities within a much of a connection there was a more than just trying to make money there was some you know there was some you know somewhere you know sending money back and things like that so that and also you know I talk about mindset you know you have to have this mindset that if you're in a fight for your life or you're with a suspect or an enemy you're fighting for your life or getting in a shootout or it could be you could be at home you could have an accident or drive a car if you're in a fight you have to survive you have to fight you have to hit claw scratch god whatever you have to do you have to think yourself I am not going to lose this fight I am not going to lose I'm going to survive I'm going to make it through that you have to have that mental attitude you know I kind of call it the warriors mindset or the winning mentality that I'm going to survive and make it through this you know there's no way I'm not going to make it through even though at first I was not unconscious my body my mind didn't give up you're going to you're going to make it through this show you know I didn't see any bright light or anything I may have saw a little fire below or something it wasn't it wasn't time so also talking to the doctors I was in really great physical shape when I got shot and the better shape you're in a lot of times the more traumatic injury you can survive and a lot of times the better your recovery is you know so they get there as for free and you know they're cooking in these houses with these little kids you know and everything is off-gassing into the you know into the air getting into the carpet and walls and everything else so we started bringing child protective services with us when we would do meth and fedamine lab warrants and they would bring the kids to the hospital and when they would test them you know high percentage of what test positive for meth and fedamine just because the staff you know was in the carpet and the atmosphere you know it just breaks my heart you know me having a daughter you know these little kids involved and then not only would they get charged with the meth lab and manufacturing they would get charged with child abuse from CPS also so you would do these investigations you're you're getting human intelligence that's telling you so you know we'll keep going that I do my motivational speaking which gives me purpose now you know we've been you know took jobs and different things we're to serve people and serve the community I can't do my job the way I have in the past but for me to get up there and talk to people and tell my story one is therapeutic for me too to talk about it and two if somebody's having a bad day a bad year or bad whatever that the sea there's always somebody that has it worse it always could be worse so you know you got to count the blessings you have and be thankful for the things that you still have you can't cry about what you don't have anymore all you can just do is move on so you know I'm gonna continue doing the motivational speaking which is good you know and when you go through there they're telling you what you're getting into you know this is what you're getting into and this unit is not for everybody and just because it may not be for you it doesn't mean that you're a bad agent that you can't do your normal job but this is what you're getting into and it's a whole that's a total volunteer unit so you get people that are going through slacking you're just getting your dick knocked into dirt and you know and if it was just you know you did you every day you did like a tier one event you'd be fine but you're also getting hazed in between you know and carrying the logs and the inflatable boats and you know doing crossfit workouts and you know you're 39 years old you're not getting much sleep but they're feeding you so you know we had several tasks in this mission you know the fine drug you know the eradicate some of the drug activity going on and also find these dishgoss so the rainders went in there before us and they got in a pretty good dust up and tick stands for troops in contact and they lost a couple of Rangers so we were going in a couple of days after and you're doing your pre-mission briefing and you know we're gonna get inserted with you know three CH47 and four CH47 helicopters and there's a high probability we're gonna lose a helicopter on infill with the dish goes and you know you're sitting in the night before you you know they think they're slick and they're gonna play both sides and do they get caught they go to prison you know some get killed you know they get found out you know we do everything we can to protect their identity and some do it for a while or some are you know trying to help their legal situation or a family member situation or just doing it for money and you know eventually move on and get on with their lives and get back into some normalcy of life you know but you know being you know having a good informant you're kind of like you know they're they're confident you know there's therapist everything else you know you're phone's gonna be ringing in middle of the night you're always going to want to talk to you you know because it's girlfriend left the left home you know you know be willing to do those things and you know on 52 years old now you can't let these young guys beat you she got to keep yourself in shape you know it was working you know work overseas you know with the special ops guys and like how old are you 41 is it okay and we didn't have a kind of tactical team that was up to speed to do this at the time years prior to that we had an operation called operations snow cap where we were in Columbia and other cocaine manufacturing destinations and hitting Coca-labs you know with you know partner forces in this and that so DEA had to start up a team so they used some of the individuals that we were working snow cap and developed this fast team this foreign deployed advisory and support team to help the military and mentor our partner force over there because we really don't have over there you know any like criminal authority so in the Afghans they were behind the time so we went over you know the military you know they got plenty of trigger pullers and of course we can pull triggers too so so you're wearing plain clothes plain clothes you got like a badge around the neck and the chain you know like TV and the pair jeans you want to look as unintimulating as possible if you want to look intimidating like what's your what's your like what's your character what character you're going into just kind of this kind of low key intimidating enough with you know you're you know federal law enforcement you know you're not playing around yes it's in it was in in Quantico Virginia inside the Quantico military base and when I went through us in the FBI shared the same academy we since have our own academy that's right next to the FBI academy but we still share the gun ranges and driving track in gym with the FBI and how long is that pipeline you know it's like um like 16 18 week academy and what are you doing is it legal is it physical is it what are you doing it's a little bit of everything um where the police academy was more paramilitary DEA was more gentleman academy you know you didn't have to line up for inspection every day I see a speck will win down your you know you're uniform and getting you know the front lean and rest position and all that jazz um but it was very intense very academically challenging very physically challenge challenging we did a lot of shooting a lot of tactical training a lot of scenarios I was very impressed with it the biggest thing was your way from your family for four months as opposed when I went to the Detroit police academy he wasn't an overnight thing you come and go and stuff that's what I would do and um their SQT was going through there at the time and um so it was a full house there how was that training it was intense you know it was you know three weeks day and night of you know getting you know kicked in the balls you know and you know this is what I was told in the seal pre-deployment workup that's usually the hardest pre-deployment block of the toughest you know those those Rangers that we would bring out their just outstanding guys because we as seals always want to have an open mind and make sure that we are understanding the tactics the techniques the procedures of other units what do they know better than us what can they teach us what can we've learned from them and that's one of the ways that we've always done that is taking individuals from other units and bringing them to our units especially to our instructor cadre so that we can learn more and try and get better and those those Rangers that work with us were just outstanding guys and I say and I feel you guys do an outstanding job of your guys as training you know like you said you know knowing that hey there's always you know there's more than one way to skin a cat but you're going to overseas fight in the war so you're using weapons and weapons systems the average DEA agent doesn't never use in their career you know you're using you know belt-fed crew surf weapons you know grenade launchers you know handheld mortars Carl Gustav rockets you know laws you know kind of crap So the training you had worked 100% you know I didn't even think you know I didn't even don't even remember looking through my sights I know I did you know you get that perceptual narrowing you know when you're in a fighter flight or a gunfight you know either eyesight increases you're hearing decreases you start so you fight motor skills so you felt all that stuff and they're partner force probably you would be around 30 you know and fast um because we were like two season three zes have a two to four fast agents and we would bring our partner force at this particular time like we could cherry pick people that were the better um fighters and um sometimes two to four we would take out and did be honest like I said we worked the best in brightest not a high percentage of them were good fighters and a lot of times they weren't in great shape so we're kind of limited what you can do how long of an infill and ex-fill you can do and how complicated a plan you could do so you know it kind of hamstringed us a little bit you know and they decide they're going to stick a nasal fair and gill airway up my nose and in training we have to insert these in any other and just sort of a nose this is like a it's basically like a you shaped tube that you cram and someone's nose that will open up the airway between your nostrils and like your lungs not all the way down your lungs but like through your head you know they're probably what do you think they are Joe like maybe five inches long total something like that and one end looks like there's a funnel on there and the other and you know in training we can put light a cane in our nose before we do it I had you know the belt you know down the feed tray cover shot you know you know the weapon cock bag but the safety on you know ready ready to go you know and they would beat up like they would pick up minorities and jump him like five on one kind of like a one percent or motorcycle gang thing and they put me in there to buy steroids from these kids so I ended up buying steroids from these kids and then later led to Sammy the bull getting to additional legal problems well where is he out right now I'm not sure we's at the moment that's crazy when you're doing these undercover ones that you're talking about are you staying under cover for a long period of time or you basically going under cover for two hours to go meet these guys buy some shit and then roll out did you ever do these guys it seems like they're going under cover for extended period of time that's called like a deep cover operation those don't happen that much anymore you know there's a lot of risk involved then there you know and you know working with the specialized special ops units if you had to work with them before and you can probably know this there's a lot of Dick measuring going out check it's like who are you what can you do if they never work with you you know you know we weren't a special option it for say you know we're the best at DEA have
