and you know I I don't know when I think about this whole thing and we've been referring back to it the whole time that so many good lessons but the the the key take away for me is that whole idea of leader versus inertia and you know as soon as I said that today Dave I looked at you and I saw you had about a thousand thoughts going through your mind don't want that means and how many ways that we can apply that it's like the world is inspiring against us and it's human nature to neglect our duties and I know that sounds crazy and sure there's some outliers out there that are proactive and make things happen but you've got to assess as a leader that human nature is to be lazy and to be careless and you need definitely looking the mirror because it's not always just going to be the people that you lead it's going to be you and that section where they talk about the hardest job that you have as a leader is getting things done getting things done by people who know that they're supposed to do them and even in some cases know that those things are costing in lives failure to do things failure to take action so don't allow that be on the lookout how nice is it sometimes when you make the connection between something that's there that you've always known was there oh no sorry this section we call that it's called something else called be brave intelligently this is a weird one to read lieutenant Colonel Ariel Bryan cavalry observer with the fifth army and Italy a prisoner of war a German light machine gunner asked an interrogator whether Americans took stimulants to make them foolishly brave when asked to explain what he meant he stated that he and an assistant gunner were in position with a good field of fire one afternoon when a group of American soldiers was observed approaching he fired several short bursts and began preparation to displace to the rear when he saw the American soldiers rise to full height and start charging toward his position over a hundred yards away he reloaded his gun and opened fire killing 11 men he then withdrew because he was sure the charge was made to conceal an development but none was made unit commander has found it necessary to direct their men to make full use of concealment and covered approach continued emphasis on the necessity for dispersion and the use of covering concealment is essential so this is what we don't want to have happen we don't want people to be so brave that you charge over an open area a machine gun nest and the comment here says in the interest of efficiency bravery must be supplemented by brain work dead heroes are of little further used to their units aggressive fighting men trained to apply the most efficient technique to combat problems willing to accept any necessary risks and conscientiously avoiding unnecessary risks are the backbone of the army got to be brave but you got to be smart there's the dichotomy who's the original original statement on that was brave but not full hearting brave but not full hearted combat in towns as major campaigns develop in western europe combat in towns assumes increasing importance cities towns and villages control the established road nets which must be open for the movement of guns heavy equipment it supplies necessary to support the advance of infantry combat in towns will often be the key not only to our successful advance but to successful defensive actions let's talk about now in 1944 attack of towns captain w heherson heherson parachute retreat Italy the theory of attack of a small town or villages to work groups around the flanks cut the retreat and moving with patrols in this hilly country however we have found that where there is any high ground behind the town which dominates both the town and the line of retreat the best way is to work the entire force around the town undercover sees the high ground in the rear and firmly establish ourselves with 60 millimeter mortars on that dominating high ground we take enough food and ammunition for to last us 24 hours and the Germans usually pull out during this time from our position we can prevent reinforcement and inflict heavy losses on them during there withdrawal so we're flanking people and we're taking high ground I didn't think of anything new I didn't think of anything new Lieutenant Colonel LG Freeman parachute infantry battalion commander in Italy we learned at Altavia to avoid the direct attack of towns it's too costly we now work around to the rear with a large force and seize the dominating ground in the rear we did this at Calo Machia for Nellie and several other places the names of which I forgot I like when you're just forgetting major battles that you've had to work every time get yourself within 60 millimeter mortar range of the town on dominating terrain in or near it and the Germans won't stay in it but why is that you know he says well because I want to have more machine guns I want to have more firepower in my base element and then the the mask shooting one question said what happens if the assault element gets compromised on the way in end of discussion because now we don't have any machine guns and and by the way what should happen is if we have machine guns in the assault element the assault element just became the base element that's what just happened so and and the thing that the other lesson that I learned from that was that what you really get to do the other benefit which I actually would say isn't even bigger benefit is we have unit integrity which I love unit integrity that squad or that platoon's always working together the machine gunners are there they can break off they can assault things they can do all kinds of things where when you pull those machine gunners out they're not they're way less capable so apply that to your business to your team how do we keep the teams together how do we keep the teams together how do we keep them both how do we keep them most capable that's what we want to do setting up a little specialty moments is a risky call factors contributing to the success in this attack were prompt estimate of the situation by the commander including a study of the terrain based on personal reconnaissance development of a definite plan of maneuver based on the seizure of key terrain and outflanking enemy position detail planning of specific orders utilization of maximum firepower where available maintenance of control over the elements little section here on fighting and wooded terrain lieutenant Colonel F.L. Walker infantry battalion commander Italy the area in which my battalion operated was covered in thick scrub trees and fruit orchards interspersed with frequent farmhouses many stone walls six to eight feet in height and numerous sunken roads field of fire was greatly restricted average observation was only 52 hundred yards enemy delaying groups with machine guns were widely scattered and impossible locate until arrival within a hundred yards or less it was found necessary to place heavy weapons out in the front line or very close up to avoid hitting our troops after encountering hostile fire was found very effective to spray the entire woods ahead with a massive concentration of mortar machine gunfire for about one minute followed by a rapid advance of rifle platoons under a salt fire to cover all the trees and house windows where snipers might be hiding in each case Germans pulled out rapidly leaving weapons and ammunition behind although we had been unable to locate them previously however the tendency of troops is to wait for definitely located targets before they will open fire which results in allowing very small groups of enemy to shift position frequently and keep up a demoralizing rate of machine gunfire to cause a great delay the continuous rapid fire delivered by our heavy machine guns had a particularly demoralizing effect on the Germans. and we dashed for the open end of the jab trench we had grenadeed the trench led around to the point of the hill we crawled down the trench and found where the japs were located when we stuck our heads right up in the face of a burst of machine gun fire some men from company f had come over to help us but we're stymied we couldn't raise up long enough to fire we couldn't get close enough to throw grenades finally we decided to see if we could get some mortar fire on the position in some way corporal outford hayman started back up to check on the mortar possibilities and while we waited and rested the jab position was slightly below us and about a hundred yards further into the pass they were firing almost constantly at the troops we could see moving out in the valley and on the opposite side of the pass we were quite high up on the side of cold mountain after nearly two hours of lying in the trench and waiting we heard one of the men behind holler here he men up here he men and a man from company h the infantry were crawling up along the little ravine laying wire they had found a company h mortar and had a line right to it the big fight up on the mountain had almost gotten to the top but the forces across the pass were getting hell from the guns below us we got the phone all set up and carefully poked a little dirt a little hole in the dirt side of the trench a week so that one man could see the whole jab position below then we called mortar and the fun started we were only about a hundred yards from where the shells were striking in the ground shook they fired several rounds close and then they began to drop right in the position finally we called and told them we were moving in and not to fire the position was like a big wheel was a big wheel like a fair with holes all around it and the spokes connecting the trenches with a big center installation in the hub two Japanese machine guns in the 37 millimeter that had fired at us during the previous week were captured and destroyed there we tossed six dead japs out the hole and brought them brought up our guns up and set them in the jap holes we there we sat that night just daring the little so and so has to come up man so i decided to make a double involvement sending company i over the hill to the right and company k on a wide left development contact was to be maintained visually so there's the action he's at that that's it's actually happening so he goes through the loop in like four sentences which is totally legit base of fire five tanks were available for the attack realizing that the tanks could not move down the road to guardia which is the only tank approach due to the streams and high mountains and because the enemy had eighty-eighths and armored cars at f i decided to do in place the tanks along with my eight heavy machine guns and six eighty-one millimeter motors as shown in the sketch results the attack was successful by order the tanks and other supporting weapons opened fire five minutes before company l started its defense that is called cover move we got tanks and and supporting weapons firing and then company l starts their move after five minutes 15 prisoners were captured 25 enemy killed our casualties were approximately ten killed and fifteen wounded which when you think about the assault on a you know in an urban environment you're going to take some casualties and those are certainly some casualties but those are not as bad as you might imagine going into a city when you consider the fact that if you don't know anything about urban combat one enemy with a machine gun can kill dozens and dozens of troops the enemy strength as determined from prisoners was two rifle companies each reinforced supported by tanks armored cars eighty-eighths along the road these prisoners stated that their force was so completely disorganized and demoralized by our volume of fire that and scheme of attack that was impossible for them to make a counterattack and regain their positions planning it took about two hours to make plans for this attack which was very carefully studied planned and coordinated it's funny it's sometimes the US military spends months making plans for an attack and and he said this took two hours and we're talking about hey you know what it depends on the initiative of initiative and aggressiveness of small unit leaders making things happen where possible town should be bypassed isolated and attacked from the flanks or the rear why are we even attacking this position if we don't have to roll around it imagine if you made that part of your everyday sort of scheme maneuver I can beat my head against this wall or I can walk around it it seems like a good idea at least it seems like a good idea to me I don't know echoes over their shaking I said like I know a lot of times when you say every you know you use those what he call those words that are real like real permanent that's available wherever

echoes at echo Charles and i am at jacca and he's like no we can't stay here and leadership is the only thing that gets people to see that that that is that those are the times when you have to lead from the front you got to make things happen doubling in brass and I have no idea I don't know if there's some weird 1940s idiom that I don't know about but this title is sections doubling in brass citation 37th division new Georgia while private Blair F. hurts was performing his duties with the maintenance section in the vicinity of the unit ration dump they were attacked by japs who had surrounded them he grabbed a bar and advanced on a jap machine gun that was delivering intense accurate and extremely effective fire into the dump private hurts was able to silence this machine gun and then continue to aid aggressively in the defense of the position until reinforcements arrived just getting after it just in the rear getting after it when the citation starts with the private you know you know this is going to be a good one you know he got some The company led by Captain Thomas Biodonol was thrown into confusion by the strafing of hostile airplanes while it was forming to attack under heavy enemy ground small arms fire seeing the immediate need captain O'Donnell move from his squad from squad to squad restoring order and then led his men to the assault during which he received a severe wound in the neck and shoulder and was evacuated three days later upon hearing that his company was again scheduled to make an attack he insisted upon returning to the fight although we can suffer severe pain from his wounds he led his company in attacks on the enemy until five days later when he was mortally wounded while moving about into advanced positions encouraging his men one of the one of the one of the lessons that I taught specifically I taught it's a little bunch of people but the first time I remember teaching if someone was to was to Seth Stone the Delta Patoon commander who you know when you're doing immediate action drills there's there's standard operating procedures and you follow you follow the standard operating procedures and he would you know he would follow what the rules were and that if that meant that he was gonna his next position that he was supposed to go to according to the standard operating procedures was behind a berm where he couldn't see anything that's where he was going and you know I just said hey man why are you going there you know uh because this is where we're supposed to go I said can you see anything no can you make a call no can you can you lead your men no okay move move around go see what you got to see you can move around you you don't you don't you can't break the SOPs there's a difference right you can't break the SOPs but you don't have to follow them perfectly so there's a big difference breaking the SOPs means you get out of your lane and now you can get shot by friendly fire not following the SOPs means you're staying within the confines of the rules but you're still moving around and telling people what to do and you can imagine this is a perfect example of what this whole thing started off with which is look this guy in order to get his troops to go he had to personally get out there and and you know why would you risk your life to him to in that's what it says encourages men why would you risk your life to encourage your men you know why because if you don't do that your men are going anywhere that's the breaking the inertia you talk about at the beginning exactly you don't do that as a leader you're going to sit there anger you're going to you're going to eventually you're going to get rolled you're all going to die in that position you cannot stay there but the path of the least resistance that human nature is I like this box hole okay I have burpees at the end of this workout I've finished the work I work out with hundred burpees we'll say I'll be like man now workout was pretty solid you know I don't know about those burpees you know let's we'll do those burpees another time we're gonna skip the burpees is what we're gonna do then this comes time to skip the point you're like you know what no hundred fifty or two hundred now just for thinking that you know what positions they had one little fight with in a battle you know one little tiny fight with in a battle and think of all those decisions that got made and all those actions that took place in the mistakes that had to be covered for and the initiative that had to be shown and the bravery and the courage I mean it's just it's leadership that's that's what it is it's leadership they they go through a bunch of this information continuing on they there's another group that takes another point and and again look these guys I can pretty much guarantee are no longer alive but this is these are quotes these are what these guys are saying happened you know things like lieutenant wallsack saying check your bayonets as they get ready to do this assault and there's just so there's some some other little battles within fights within battles that they cover and then it gets into this comment section these accounts bring out some of the characteristics of mountain warfare in which success depends more upon proper adaptation of available means to the terrain then upon their power so the way you adapt is more important they continue maneuver of small units and the initiative and leadership of subordinate commanders are of the highest importance in mountain warfare the actions of small semi-independent units in seizing or defending heights and or in fighting to seize or block passes become of increasing importance so once again even though this book starts off with the extreme dichotomy of discipline of following orders it comes back always to decentralize command an individual initiative by subordinate leaders to make things happen he's talking about mountain warfare there and and getting to this idea of I mean that's it that's leadership yeah we're gonna just surround the target it works when nothing goes wrong it works when the enemy doesn't start shooting it works if you have on the positive side it works if you have a terrain feature that prevents friendly fire which is possible you can have a you know a ravine that allows you to be in a certain position but when you when you do these battalion sized operations you're actually getting out of the you should be moving outside the range of your own weapons which is what the goal is right you know we're really far away and and as long as we are shooting our weapons at the enemy there's a very small chance that our weapons are gonna hit our friendly forces so be very careful about double development and same thing with going to an enemy's rear like if you're gonna do that so what what what what am I supposed to do then just keep so what we we've heard that question we hear that question a lot I always have to put myself in check because just because I think that's what they're going to say doesn't mean that's what they're going to say it doesn't mean that there's not some nuance to it doesn't mean that I can spit out some module about how you you know well you continue to support them no listen to what they're saying don't stop them from talking you know the the minute somewhere I see this in group dynamics you know there's a discussion going on and someone's talking and someone else someone else in the group will cut them off and this is another thing I talked about on the F online think about how disrespeckful it is to cut someone off right like you might not say anything to me because if I think I know what Dave's going to say I'm going to cut him off and that's true and even if it's subconscious it's true you know because if I don't know what you're going to say and I'm like kind of curious I'm going to I'm going to wait to hear it you know
