00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.16
This is Jocopotcast number 161.

2
00:00:04.16 --> 00:00:07.36
With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

3
00:00:07.36 --> 00:00:08.84
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:08.84 --> 00:00:10.84
Good evening.

5
00:00:10.84 --> 00:00:15.80
I do the wrong.

6
00:00:15.80 --> 00:00:22.16
And first begin to brawl the secret mischiefs that I set a broach.

7
00:00:22.16 --> 00:00:26.92
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.

8
00:00:26.92 --> 00:00:31.24
Clarence whom I indeed have cast in darkness.

9
00:00:31.24 --> 00:00:40.52
I do bewep to many simple goals, namely to derby Hastings, bucking him, and tell them

10
00:00:40.52 --> 00:00:49.68
to the queen and her allies that stir the king against the Duke, my brother.

11
00:00:49.68 --> 00:00:59.24
And now they believe it, and with all wet me to be revenge on rivers, dorset, gray.

12
00:00:59.24 --> 00:01:11.32
But then I sigh, and with a piece of scripture, tell them that God bids us to good for evil.

13
00:01:11.32 --> 00:01:21.32
And thus I clothe my naked villainy with odd old and stolen out of holy wit and seen

14
00:01:21.32 --> 00:01:23.48
a saint.

15
00:01:23.48 --> 00:01:31.20
When most I play the devil.

16
00:01:31.20 --> 00:01:43.86
And that right there is a few lines from the play, Richard III, written by Good Old William

17
00:01:43.86 --> 00:01:48.08
Shakespeare, the bard.

18
00:01:48.08 --> 00:02:03.16
And clearly, Richard III is made out in this play to be an evil, like 100% evil, political

19
00:02:03.16 --> 00:02:04.32
maneuverer.

20
00:02:04.32 --> 00:02:06.36
That's what he's made out to be.

21
00:02:06.36 --> 00:02:16.96
Sort of the ultimate archetype of the Macavailian Macavailian leader.

22
00:02:16.96 --> 00:02:24.72
And there's people that say, and it's certainly seems that Shakespeare intentionally wrote

23
00:02:24.72 --> 00:02:25.72
him that way.

24
00:02:25.72 --> 00:02:26.72
And there's a bunch of things.

25
00:02:26.72 --> 00:02:32.68
I guess at some point we'll go over the whole play of Richard III.

26
00:02:32.68 --> 00:02:34.68
Let's take a look at the lines.

27
00:02:34.68 --> 00:02:42.56
Because Macavailian, what we think of it when we hear it now, is we think that it means

28
00:02:42.56 --> 00:02:47.96
someone that is completely devious and completely dishonest and completely deceitful in their

29
00:02:47.96 --> 00:02:49.60
quest for power.

30
00:02:49.60 --> 00:02:50.60
Right.

31
00:02:50.60 --> 00:02:53.68
That's what people think of when they think of Macavailian.

32
00:02:53.68 --> 00:03:04.76
And definitely I think Richard III is made to be and was written to be sort of the quintessential

33
00:03:04.76 --> 00:03:06.40
Macavailian character.

34
00:03:06.40 --> 00:03:13.16
Let's look at these lines a little bit because as I said, when we did Henry the Fifth on

35
00:03:13.16 --> 00:03:18.76
podcast number 15, you're not going to know exactly what Shakespeare is talking about because

36
00:03:18.76 --> 00:03:21.52
he's writing in an almost in another language.

37
00:03:21.52 --> 00:03:22.52
So not quite.

38
00:03:22.52 --> 00:03:23.52
You can still understand it.

39
00:03:23.52 --> 00:03:27.000
It doesn't take much, but there's some things going on in there.

40
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So it starts off.

41
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.08
I do the wrong and first begin to brawl.

42
00:03:30.08 --> 00:03:31.08
So what was he saying there?

43
00:03:31.08 --> 00:03:35.60
I am the one that is doing something that is wrong.

44
00:03:35.60 --> 00:03:37.48
I'm the one that's starting the fights.

45
00:03:37.48 --> 00:03:38.80
That's what's going on here.

46
00:03:38.80 --> 00:03:39.80
I'm starting the fights.

47
00:03:39.80 --> 00:03:46.32
And then he says, the secret mischiefs that I set a broach, I lay unto the grievous charge

48
00:03:46.32 --> 00:03:47.32
of others.

49
00:03:47.32 --> 00:03:55.36
So these bad behaviors that he's undertaking, that he's secretly undertaking, he is blaming

50
00:03:55.36 --> 00:03:58.52
them on other people.

51
00:03:58.52 --> 00:04:03.40
He then goes on to say, Clarence, whom I indeed have cast in darkness and you wouldn't

52
00:04:03.40 --> 00:04:04.40
quite understand this.

53
00:04:04.40 --> 00:04:13.52
But unless you read it, but his brother Clarence, he put his brother Clarence into prison.

54
00:04:13.52 --> 00:04:16.88
And then he says, I do bewep to many simple goals.

55
00:04:16.88 --> 00:04:23.12
So in front of other people, he cries and bemoans that, oh poor Clarence, but he thinks

56
00:04:23.12 --> 00:04:25.12
those people are fools.

57
00:04:25.12 --> 00:04:29.04
Namely Derby Hastings and Buckingham, which is what he says in the next line.

58
00:04:29.04 --> 00:04:33.12
And then he says that he tells those same people, he tells those people that it's the

59
00:04:33.12 --> 00:04:38.12
queen and her allies and tell them to his the queen and her allies.

60
00:04:38.12 --> 00:04:40.44
He's saying, like, look, this isn't about me.

61
00:04:40.44 --> 00:04:41.44
It's about the queen.

62
00:04:41.44 --> 00:04:43.92
She's the one that's doing all this.

63
00:04:43.92 --> 00:04:50.04
She's the one that stir the king against the Duke, my brother.

64
00:04:50.04 --> 00:04:51.20
So it's not my fault.

65
00:04:51.20 --> 00:04:53.72
It's the queen.

66
00:04:53.72 --> 00:04:59.32
And then he says, now they believe it and with all with me, meaning they believe it.

67
00:04:59.32 --> 00:05:01.04
And then they're aching him on.

68
00:05:01.04 --> 00:05:02.04
Like you need to.

69
00:05:02.04 --> 00:05:03.04
You can't let that stay.

70
00:05:03.04 --> 00:05:04.92
If you think of that, twist, and try it there.

71
00:05:04.92 --> 00:05:10.64
Like you're setting this up, but then you've got these people actually egging you to take vengeance

72
00:05:10.64 --> 00:05:16.04
on the situation, which is what they're egging him on to do back to the book to be

73
00:05:16.04 --> 00:05:20.000
revenge on rivers, dorsed gray.

74
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.20
But then here's where it, here's where it takes a little, a little switch.

75
00:05:24.20 --> 00:05:30.28
But then I sigh and with a piece of scripture.

76
00:05:30.28 --> 00:05:36.52
He's going to say, and then he's going to quote the Bible.

77
00:05:36.52 --> 00:05:42.12
He says, he tells them that God bids us to good for evil.

78
00:05:42.12 --> 00:05:44.44
Hey, the Bible says we should do good instead of evil.

79
00:05:44.44 --> 00:05:46.80
That's what's going on here.

80
00:05:46.80 --> 00:05:50.52
And then he says, and thus I cloth my naked villainy.

81
00:05:50.52 --> 00:05:52.32
That's a good line.

82
00:05:52.32 --> 00:05:54.72
You gotta be Shakespeare right, that one, right?

83
00:05:54.72 --> 00:05:57.20
Clove my naked villainy.

84
00:05:57.20 --> 00:06:07.68
This is how I dress up my evil plans with odd old ends stolen out of holy rets.

85
00:06:07.68 --> 00:06:10.88
So he dresses up his naked villainy.

86
00:06:10.88 --> 00:06:19.08
Covers his evil plans with little parts of scripture from the Bible.

87
00:06:19.08 --> 00:06:28.16
He closes it and seems a saint when most I play the devil.

88
00:06:28.16 --> 00:06:35.44
So like I said, that's Richard III and things don't really work out that well in the

89
00:06:35.44 --> 00:06:40.16
play for Richard III and they don't, they don't work out for him in real life either.

90
00:06:40.16 --> 00:06:44.52
He was actually hacked to death.

91
00:06:44.52 --> 00:06:49.24
Yeah, which we generally consider to be a bad ending, he was hacked to death at the end

92
00:06:49.24 --> 00:06:54.20
of the Battle of Baudsworth after he fell off of this horse legit.

93
00:06:54.20 --> 00:06:57.24
And there's a famous line which I'm sure everyone's heard a horse or horse making them

94
00:06:57.24 --> 00:07:03.04
for a horse, which is he was losing everything because he fell off of the horse and needed

95
00:07:03.04 --> 00:07:04.04
one.

96
00:07:04.04 --> 00:07:08.04
And like I said, perhaps at some point we'll cover the whole play.

97
00:07:08.04 --> 00:07:16.12
But today, what I wanted to dig into a little bit is this term of Mackey Evelian and we

98
00:07:16.12 --> 00:07:22.92
covered his art of war book, which I had an interesting, I think it was a YouTube comment

99
00:07:22.92 --> 00:07:26.64
because I said, you know, art of war, Mackey Evelian, a colo Mackey Evelian and someone's like

100
00:07:26.64 --> 00:07:30.04
that was written by Sunsu idiot.

101
00:07:30.04 --> 00:07:33.04
And then some trooper came on.

102
00:07:33.04 --> 00:07:35.68
It was like actually he's not talking about that.

103
00:07:35.68 --> 00:07:39.68
I've never heard of it before.

104
00:07:39.68 --> 00:07:42.68
He covered that one here and covered that's owned this by the way.

105
00:07:42.68 --> 00:07:44.68
There's a bunch of different art of wars and here's one of them.

106
00:07:44.68 --> 00:07:47.68
That was indeed written by Mackey Evelian.

107
00:07:47.68 --> 00:07:53.68
So we covered that, but that's not really Mackey Evelian's most famous work.

108
00:07:53.68 --> 00:07:56.68
His most famous work is this book, which we mentioned there.

109
00:07:56.68 --> 00:07:59.68
The Prince and the Prince was thought to have been written around 1513, not really widely

110
00:07:59.68 --> 00:08:04.68
published until 1532, which was five years after Mackey Evelian's death.

111
00:08:04.68 --> 00:08:10.68
Basically, the four runner of kind of leadership books, right?

112
00:08:10.68 --> 00:08:14.68
Is the four runner of self-improvement books.

113
00:08:14.68 --> 00:08:20.68
And it's telling leaders how to lead their Prince of Paladies.

114
00:08:20.68 --> 00:08:26.68
And one thing, and I don't dive too many of these, we're not going to come to many of these,

115
00:08:26.68 --> 00:08:28.68
but it gives real world instructions.

116
00:08:28.68 --> 00:08:30.68
It's kind of like extreme ownership of the dichotomy of leadership.

117
00:08:30.68 --> 00:08:32.68
It gives real situations that happen.

118
00:08:32.68 --> 00:08:36.68
It gives the Prince of Poland, and it's like here's a situation where this actually unfolds in this way.

119
00:08:36.68 --> 00:08:40.68
So it's very thorough in that respect.

120
00:08:40.68 --> 00:08:48.68
And it's considered to be one of the first works of modern political philosophy.

121
00:08:48.68 --> 00:08:50.68
And this is the thing.

122
00:08:50.68 --> 00:08:58.68
It has the reputation of advising people to do whatever it takes to gain and hold power.

123
00:08:58.68 --> 00:09:04.68
That's sort of the word, like I said, the word has really negative connotations.

124
00:09:04.68 --> 00:09:06.68
When someone says, oh, that guy's a Macavalean leader.

125
00:09:06.68 --> 00:09:08.68
You don't think, oh, that's cool.

126
00:09:08.68 --> 00:09:13.68
No, you think, oh, he's underhanded, and he's going to stab people in the back to get where he wants.

127
00:09:13.68 --> 00:09:16.68
And there's definitely some parts where we'll get to it.

128
00:09:16.68 --> 00:09:19.68
But it's not that.

129
00:09:19.68 --> 00:09:26.68
And the approach is much more balanced than people than people than he has.

130
00:09:26.68 --> 00:09:29.68
Then then people generally consider.

131
00:09:29.68 --> 00:09:32.68
It's just a much more balanced perspective.

132
00:09:32.68 --> 00:09:38.68
And like anything that talks about leadership and human nature, we can learn from it.

133
00:09:38.68 --> 00:09:42.68
So let's go to the book, The Prince, by Macavalean.

134
00:09:42.68 --> 00:09:44.68
Starts off here.

135
00:09:44.68 --> 00:09:47.68
Those who strive to, this is an interesting.

136
00:09:47.68 --> 00:09:50.68
He's doing a little, he does some salesy stuff in here too.

137
00:09:50.68 --> 00:09:53.68
And there's a couple of times where I have to, I had to call it.

138
00:09:53.68 --> 00:09:57.68
I'll call it out all, if anybody does some sale lease, salesy type stuff in here.

139
00:09:57.68 --> 00:09:58.68
So here's how we start stuff.

140
00:09:58.68 --> 00:10:04.68
Those who strive to obtain the good graces of a prince are accustomed to come before him with such things as they hold most precious,

141
00:10:04.68 --> 00:10:07.68
or in which they see him to take most delight.

142
00:10:07.68 --> 00:10:14.68
Once one often sees horses, arms, cloth of gold, precious stones, and similar ornaments presented to princes, worthy of their greatness.

143
00:10:14.68 --> 00:10:21.68
So you say, hey, if you want to get good, you know, good graces with a prince, you bring them stuff, horses and gold and whatever.

144
00:10:21.68 --> 00:10:28.68
Then he says, desiring, therefore, to present myself to your magnificent with some testimony of my devotion towards you,

145
00:10:28.68 --> 00:10:39.68
I have not found among my possessions anything which I hold more dear than or value so much as the knowledge of the actions of great men,

146
00:10:39.68 --> 00:10:45.68
acquired by long experience in contemporary affairs and a continual study of antiquity,

147
00:10:45.68 --> 00:10:53.68
which having reflected upon and which having a reflected upon it with great and prolonged diligence, I now send,

148
00:10:53.68 --> 00:10:57.68
digested into a little volume to your magnificence.

149
00:10:57.68 --> 00:10:59.68
That's pretty cool.

150
00:10:59.68 --> 00:11:04.68
He says, look, I could give you gold, but that's not really what's valuable to me.

151
00:11:04.68 --> 00:11:11.68
What's valuable to the most valuable thing I can give you is the knowledge that I have, the knowledge that I've had from studying and living through these things,

152
00:11:11.68 --> 00:11:18.68
and he continues. And although I may consider this work unwordy of your countenance, nevertheless,

153
00:11:18.68 --> 00:11:29.68
I trust much to your, uh, benignity that it may be acceptable, seeing that it is not possible for me to make a better gift than to offer you the opportunity,

154
00:11:29.68 --> 00:11:41.68
opportunity of understanding in the shortest time, all that I have learned in so many years, and with so many troubles and dangers, which work, I have not embellished with swelling or magnificent words,

155
00:11:41.68 --> 00:11:47.68
nor stuffed with rounded periods. So he comes out of the game.

156
00:11:47.68 --> 00:11:54.68
He's a pretty arrogant dude. He's saying, listen, you are so lucky that I went through all this stuff, and I'm taking it to give it to you.

157
00:11:54.68 --> 00:12:01.68
I'm going to give you this little, nice little volume, very plainly written, which is almost like an excuse, right?

158
00:12:01.68 --> 00:12:08.68
Like there's no fancy words here. I'm just giving it to you straight. You know, I, I'm no Shakespeare, well, Shakespeare wasn't even around yet,

159
00:12:08.68 --> 00:12:17.68
but he's saying that it's very plainly written. And then he goes into it. So I think that's a pretty salesy opening, but hey, good to go on him. He's trying to make it happen.

160
00:12:17.68 --> 00:12:25.68
It starts off talking about the difficulties that occur in a new principality. In principalities, you use that word. That's the, what the book is about.

161
00:12:25.68 --> 00:12:30.68
It's when you take over bland from people.

162
00:12:30.68 --> 00:12:32.68
Here we go.

163
00:12:32.68 --> 00:12:43.68
Although one may be very strong in armed forces, yet in entering a province, one has always need of the goodwill of the natives.

164
00:12:43.68 --> 00:12:51.68
That's a great statement. Think about that statement. Think about it from a military perspective. Think about it from a business perspective.

165
00:12:51.68 --> 00:13:02.68
And this is something that the US military should always pay attention to. Hey, you can be strong, and your armed forces can be strong, but you need the goodwill of the natives.

166
00:13:02.68 --> 00:13:08.68
Boom, there you go. Let's think about, let's remember that one in the world.

167
00:13:08.68 --> 00:13:16.68
And we know we do our best to do that. America does its best to do that, but we don't always do a good job.

168
00:13:16.68 --> 00:13:21.68
And then the other thing is when you think about it from a business perspective, when you get an acquisition taking place.

169
00:13:21.68 --> 00:13:26.68
Like it's cool. You go in there and you got all the money to buy some little company, but if they all hate you,

170
00:13:26.68 --> 00:13:36.68
Hey, if you don't have the goodwill of the people that you just bought, you're going to have some issues. I promise you you're going to have some issues.

171
00:13:36.68 --> 00:13:46.68
Next up, those demands which when acquired are added to an ancient state by him who acquires them are either of the same country and language or they are not.

172
00:13:46.68 --> 00:13:51.68
So he's saying, look, when you take someone over, they're either with the same language or they don't have the same language.

173
00:13:51.68 --> 00:13:57.68
When they are, it is easier to hold them, especially when they have not been accustomed to self government.

174
00:13:57.68 --> 00:14:03.68
So if you take someone over and they speak your language and they've, you know, you took them over from someone else that was controlling them.

175
00:14:03.68 --> 00:14:07.68
They'll be okay with that because they're not used to controlling themselves anyways.

176
00:14:07.68 --> 00:14:15.68
Then he goes on, but when states acquired in a country differing language, customs or laws, there are difficulties.

177
00:14:15.68 --> 00:14:27.68
And good fortune and great energy are needed to hold them and one of the greatest and most real helps would be that he who has acquired them should go reside there.

178
00:14:27.68 --> 00:14:33.68
So if they don't speak your language, if it's the different culture, guess what, you've got to go there and you've got to stay there.

179
00:14:33.68 --> 00:14:36.68
Otherwise, it's going to be a problem.

180
00:14:36.68 --> 00:14:41.68
So they're going to move there to, so they can gain more understanding.

181
00:14:41.68 --> 00:14:44.68
Game more understanding and learn the language and stuff like that.

182
00:14:44.68 --> 00:14:49.68
And also be there because you've got to be able to pay attention when rebellion is going to form against it.

183
00:14:49.68 --> 00:14:56.68
If you're not there and they speak a different language, you have a darker culture and you're not in the game.

184
00:14:56.68 --> 00:14:58.68
You're going to have some issues.

185
00:14:58.68 --> 00:14:59.68
Yeah, you're going to get blindsided.

186
00:14:59.68 --> 00:15:00.68
So you've got to go in there.

187
00:15:00.68 --> 00:15:01.68
You've got to get deep.

188
00:15:01.68 --> 00:15:04.68
You've got to occupy that territory.

189
00:15:04.68 --> 00:15:11.68
Continuing on, men ought either to be well treated or crushed.

190
00:15:11.68 --> 00:15:13.68
They read that one again.

191
00:15:13.68 --> 00:15:21.68
Men ought either to be well treated or crushed because they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries.

192
00:15:21.68 --> 00:15:24.68
Of more serious ones, they cannot.

193
00:15:24.68 --> 00:15:33.68
Therefore, the injury that is to be done to a man ought to be of such kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.

194
00:15:33.68 --> 00:15:37.68
So there's kind of classic Mackey of Alien fought.

195
00:15:37.68 --> 00:15:38.68
Yeah.

196
00:15:38.68 --> 00:15:44.68
If you're going to hurt someone, just completely annihilate them to the best of your ability.

197
00:15:44.68 --> 00:15:47.68
Don't give them the ability to come back at you again.

198
00:15:47.68 --> 00:15:48.68
Yeah.

199
00:15:48.68 --> 00:15:52.68
And then on the other hand, treat them super good, right?

200
00:15:52.68 --> 00:15:55.68
Yeah, treat them good.

201
00:15:55.68 --> 00:15:58.68
You treat them good or you crush them.

202
00:15:58.68 --> 00:16:00.68
Yeah.

203
00:16:00.68 --> 00:16:04.68
It's a good statement, right?

204
00:16:04.68 --> 00:16:05.68
Yeah.

205
00:16:05.68 --> 00:16:11.68
And it takes something that it takes, you know, the will to completely destroy someone.

206
00:16:11.68 --> 00:16:14.68
It takes a lot of gall, right?

207
00:16:14.68 --> 00:16:16.68
You have to have the stomach to be able to do that.

208
00:16:16.68 --> 00:16:17.68
Yeah.

209
00:16:17.68 --> 00:16:19.68
And a lot of people don't have the stomach to do that.

210
00:16:19.68 --> 00:16:25.68
So that's why I would say in most cases, it's better to treat people well and have them come and board.

211
00:16:25.68 --> 00:16:28.68
And he actually says that too, but we'll get there.

212
00:16:28.68 --> 00:16:46.68
Back to the book, in maintaining armed men, their in place of colonies, one spends much more having to consume on the garrison, all of the income from the states that the whole acquisition turns into a loss and many more are exasperated because the whole state is injured.

213
00:16:46.68 --> 00:16:53.68
That's what he's saying. So when you do have to go in and you have to smash and you have to keep people there to keep smashing, guess what? You're spending all this money.

214
00:16:53.68 --> 00:16:56.68
You're investing all these people.

215
00:16:56.68 --> 00:17:01.68
And it's so hard to keep it under control that it's not even worth it.

216
00:17:01.68 --> 00:17:04.68
The acquisition turns into a loss.

217
00:17:04.68 --> 00:17:11.68
So from a business perspective, you go into a company, you buy them, but then they're rebellious.

218
00:17:11.68 --> 00:17:15.68
So you got to fire everyone, they got to bring people in and retrain them and you got to retake territory and you lost customers because they're going to be in a company.

219
00:17:15.68 --> 00:17:18.68
You lost customers because you didn't support during that time.

220
00:17:18.68 --> 00:17:23.68
And so you invest all this money and guess what your acquisition ends up becoming a loss.

221
00:17:23.68 --> 00:17:29.68
Whereas, if you had a good relationship with these people and you went in there and you were able to kind of come on board with your culture and the way you were doing thing.

222
00:17:29.68 --> 00:17:32.68
Also, and you move into a good scenario.

223
00:17:32.68 --> 00:17:33.68
Yeah.

224
00:17:33.68 --> 00:17:36.68
Keep it. Keep it.

225
00:17:36.68 --> 00:17:39.68
Friendly if you can.

226
00:17:39.68 --> 00:17:41.68
Back to the book.

227
00:17:41.68 --> 00:17:57.68
What all prudent princes ought to do who have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones for which they must prepare with every energy because when first scene, it is easy to remedy them.

228
00:17:57.68 --> 00:18:05.68
But if you wait until they approach, the medicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable.

229
00:18:05.68 --> 00:18:10.68
There's some good stuff in this book and this is one of them. This is kind of obvious.

230
00:18:10.68 --> 00:18:16.68
But hey, you need to look to the future and when there's a problem coming, cut it off early.

231
00:18:16.68 --> 00:18:20.68
The earlier you solve the problem, the easier it's going to be. He continues.

232
00:18:20.68 --> 00:18:26.68
For it happens in this as the physicians say it happens in hectic fever.

233
00:18:26.68 --> 00:18:33.68
Then in the beginning of the malady, it is easy to cure, but difficult to detect.

234
00:18:33.68 --> 00:18:39.68
But in the course of time, not having been either detected or treating in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect.

235
00:18:39.68 --> 00:18:43.68
But difficult to cure.

236
00:18:43.68 --> 00:18:45.68
It's like getting caught in our mock.

237
00:18:45.68 --> 00:18:47.68
If you see it coming, it's easy.

238
00:18:47.68 --> 00:18:50.68
You just move your shoulder. You move your hips a little bit, whatever you're out.

239
00:18:50.68 --> 00:18:55.68
The further it goes down that path, the worse the situation gets.

240
00:18:55.68 --> 00:18:57.68
And it's the same thing.

241
00:18:57.68 --> 00:19:01.68
Also, you know what I've talked about having hard conversations with people.

242
00:19:01.68 --> 00:19:05.68
The earlier you have that hard conversation, the easier the hard conversation is to have.

243
00:19:05.68 --> 00:19:11.68
The longer you let it go, not only is it a harder conversation, but it's a conversation that's going to disrupt and cause more problems.

244
00:19:11.68 --> 00:19:14.68
It's going to interfere with our relationship.

245
00:19:14.68 --> 00:19:18.68
If I have that hard conversation, you are really, our relationship isn't getting better, right?

246
00:19:18.68 --> 00:19:20.68
It's getting worse.

247
00:19:20.68 --> 00:19:24.68
So the easier you solve these problems, the better off you're going to be.

248
00:19:24.68 --> 00:19:27.68
It continues. This happens in affairs of state.

249
00:19:27.68 --> 00:19:33.68
For when the evils that arise have been for scene, which it is only given to a wise man to see,

250
00:19:33.68 --> 00:19:36.68
they can be quickly redressed.

251
00:19:36.68 --> 00:19:43.68
But when through not having been for scene, they have been permitted to grow in a way that everyone can see them.

252
00:19:43.68 --> 00:19:46.68
There is no longer a remedy.

253
00:19:46.68 --> 00:19:49.68
Keep your ears to the ground.

254
00:19:49.68 --> 00:19:51.68
So you've got to hear what's coming.

255
00:19:51.68 --> 00:19:55.68
Therefore, the Romans for seeing troubles dealt with them at once.

256
00:19:55.68 --> 00:19:59.68
And even to avoid a war would not let them come to a head.

257
00:19:59.68 --> 00:20:06.68
For they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of others.

258
00:20:06.68 --> 00:20:11.68
So every time you delay in getting that problem solved, you're not helping yourself.

259
00:20:11.68 --> 00:20:14.68
That's a good way to think about that.

260
00:20:14.68 --> 00:20:16.68
I haven't really thought about that way before.

261
00:20:16.68 --> 00:20:18.68
I talk about the hard conversations to have them earlier.

262
00:20:18.68 --> 00:20:19.68
You're going to be easier.

263
00:20:19.68 --> 00:20:24.68
If you're putting those wars off, you're only helping the other person.

264
00:20:24.68 --> 00:20:26.68
You're only putting yourself into a worse situation.

265
00:20:26.68 --> 00:20:29.68
Okay, so the other person meaning the enemy?

266
00:20:29.68 --> 00:20:32.68
Yeah, you're only helping the enemy.

267
00:20:34.68 --> 00:20:37.68
So attack those problems.

268
00:20:37.68 --> 00:20:40.68
Look, well, I think the first thing is pay attention.

269
00:20:40.68 --> 00:20:42.68
You've got to pay attention to those problems that could be arising.

270
00:20:42.68 --> 00:20:43.68
Hard to detach.

271
00:20:43.68 --> 00:20:45.68
Hard to detachers.

272
00:20:45.68 --> 00:20:48.68
And then I like he says it when everyone can see him.

273
00:20:48.68 --> 00:20:49.68
It's too late.

274
00:20:49.68 --> 00:20:50.68
You're late.

275
00:20:50.68 --> 00:20:52.68
So you've got to be gathering in intelligence.

276
00:20:52.68 --> 00:20:54.68
You've got to be paying attention.

277
00:20:54.68 --> 00:21:01.68
Back to the book because one can easily enter there by gaining over some barren of the kingdom.

278
00:21:01.68 --> 00:21:06.68
For one always finds mal contents and such as desire a change.

279
00:21:06.68 --> 00:21:10.68
So he's talking about when you're taking someone when you're taking over like a kingdom,

280
00:21:10.68 --> 00:21:15.68
you can always find some people in the kingdom that are not happy with the situation.

281
00:21:15.68 --> 00:21:18.68
Like you can go into a company and you can say,

282
00:21:18.68 --> 00:21:20.68
It seems like you're the way your process is working.

283
00:21:20.68 --> 00:21:22.68
It's a real hard on you guys.

284
00:21:22.68 --> 00:21:24.68
Seems like they're not really invent.

285
00:21:24.68 --> 00:21:26.68
You can always find some people that are mad inside of a kingdom.

286
00:21:26.68 --> 00:21:27.68
Yeah.

287
00:21:27.68 --> 00:21:28.68
That's what he's saying.

288
00:21:28.68 --> 00:21:29.68
He's saying to find them.

289
00:21:29.68 --> 00:21:30.68
Yeah.

290
00:21:30.68 --> 00:21:31.68
Well, he hears he goes on.

291
00:21:31.68 --> 00:21:37.68
He says, such men for the reasons given can open the way into a state and render victory easy.

292
00:21:37.68 --> 00:21:40.68
But if you wish to hold it afterwards,

293
00:21:40.68 --> 00:21:43.68
you meet with infinite difficulties.

294
00:21:43.68 --> 00:21:47.68
Both from those you have assisted and those you have crushed.

295
00:21:47.68 --> 00:21:51.68
Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated the family of the prince because the lords

296
00:21:51.68 --> 00:21:55.68
that remain make themselves the heads of fresh movements against you.

297
00:21:55.68 --> 00:21:59.68
And as you are unable to either satisfy or exterminate them,

298
00:21:59.68 --> 00:22:03.68
the state is lost whenever the time brings the opportunity.

299
00:22:03.68 --> 00:22:05.68
What you're dealing with there,

300
00:22:05.68 --> 00:22:09.68
if you're entering, if you find some people that are disloyal inside of a company

301
00:22:09.68 --> 00:22:11.68
and then you go and become friends with them,

302
00:22:11.68 --> 00:22:13.68
and then you go and take the company over.

303
00:22:13.68 --> 00:22:15.68
There's a chance.

304
00:22:15.68 --> 00:22:19.68
And what he's saying is like that disloyalty is a trait.

305
00:22:19.68 --> 00:22:21.68
They're going to be disloyalty too.

306
00:22:21.68 --> 00:22:23.68
So you need to.

307
00:22:23.68 --> 00:22:25.68
And you can't crush them.

308
00:22:25.68 --> 00:22:27.68
You can't exterminate them because

309
00:22:27.68 --> 00:22:31.68
you've developed a relationship with them.

310
00:22:31.68 --> 00:22:33.68
And at the same time,

311
00:22:33.68 --> 00:22:35.68
you can't trust them.

312
00:22:35.68 --> 00:22:36.68
Yeah.

313
00:22:36.68 --> 00:22:38.68
So be careful with that.

314
00:22:38.68 --> 00:22:40.68
Yeah.

315
00:22:40.68 --> 00:22:41.68
Back to the book.

316
00:22:41.68 --> 00:22:45.68
Whenever those states which have been acquired as stated above,

317
00:22:45.68 --> 00:22:48.68
have been accustomed to live under their own laws and in freedom.

318
00:22:48.68 --> 00:22:52.68
There are three courses for those who wish to hold them.

319
00:22:52.68 --> 00:22:56.68
So obviously, I'm skipping big chunks of the book.

320
00:22:56.68 --> 00:23:00.68
But what he's talking about is when you've taken over somewhere,

321
00:23:00.68 --> 00:23:04.68
that is used to having their own laws and used to living in freedom.

322
00:23:04.68 --> 00:23:10.68
There's three different, three different methods or approaches you can take.

323
00:23:10.68 --> 00:23:14.68
If you want to hang onto him.

324
00:23:14.68 --> 00:23:15.68
Here we go.

325
00:23:15.68 --> 00:23:19.68
The first is to ruin them.

326
00:23:19.68 --> 00:23:24.68
The next is to reside there in person.

327
00:23:24.68 --> 00:23:28.68
The third is to permit them to live under their own laws,

328
00:23:28.68 --> 00:23:30.68
drawing a tribute and establishing within it,

329
00:23:30.68 --> 00:23:33.68
an oligarchy which will keep it friendly to you.

330
00:23:33.68 --> 00:23:35.68
Very clever.

331
00:23:35.68 --> 00:23:37.68
Very clever.

332
00:23:37.68 --> 00:23:39.68
Very smart too.

333
00:23:39.68 --> 00:23:43.68
And I see, again, I keep going back to business a lot because

334
00:23:43.68 --> 00:23:47.68
when you're dealing with a company that acquires other companies.

335
00:23:47.68 --> 00:23:49.68
This is very real.

336
00:23:49.68 --> 00:23:52.68
If you've got a company, let's say you acquire,

337
00:23:52.68 --> 00:23:59.68
let's say you acquire a part of a company that's been run by some senior company.

338
00:23:59.68 --> 00:24:00.68
Like a parent company.

339
00:24:00.68 --> 00:24:02.68
They're not used to making their own decisions.

340
00:24:02.68 --> 00:24:04.68
So when you come in and say, hey, now we're going to help you out.

341
00:24:04.68 --> 00:24:06.68
You're going to be kind of going along.

342
00:24:06.68 --> 00:24:07.68
We lost now.

343
00:24:07.68 --> 00:24:08.68
You're under our command.

344
00:24:08.68 --> 00:24:11.68
If they're used to being commanded, they're like, okay, new boss,

345
00:24:11.68 --> 00:24:13.68
we're going to deal with it.

346
00:24:13.68 --> 00:24:16.68
But if they were, if they were their own company,

347
00:24:16.68 --> 00:24:19.68
they were on their own and they were doing whatever they wanted.

348
00:24:19.68 --> 00:24:21.68
They were living in total freedom.

349
00:24:21.68 --> 00:24:22.68
And now you're coming.

350
00:24:22.68 --> 00:24:24.68
Now you're going to start listening to my rules.

351
00:24:24.68 --> 00:24:25.68
Yeah.

352
00:24:25.68 --> 00:24:26.68
You're going to be a problem.

353
00:24:26.68 --> 00:24:27.68
Yeah.

354
00:24:27.68 --> 00:24:29.68
Now I don't agree with the fact that you have to crush them.

355
00:24:29.68 --> 00:24:32.68
I would prefer that you go in and form a relationship with them.

356
00:24:32.68 --> 00:24:34.68
But what are you saying is, look, if you go in there,

357
00:24:34.68 --> 00:24:38.68
so let's say I took over Echo's company and you were used to freedom.

358
00:24:38.68 --> 00:24:41.68
And I was just like, hey, Echo, here's what's going on.

359
00:24:41.68 --> 00:24:44.68
Hey, here's some broad guidance, but I really like what you're doing.

360
00:24:44.68 --> 00:24:45.68
Keep doing it, man.

361
00:24:45.68 --> 00:24:46.68
Keep doing it.

362
00:24:46.68 --> 00:24:47.68
And then, you know, here's what you're going to pay me,

363
00:24:47.68 --> 00:24:48.68
because I'm giving you some support.

364
00:24:48.68 --> 00:24:50.68
And you'd be like, okay.

365
00:24:50.68 --> 00:24:54.68
Now what I will say, which he doesn't go into is over time.

366
00:24:54.68 --> 00:24:57.68
I can start to get first of all, build a relationship with you.

367
00:24:57.68 --> 00:25:00.68
Once I build a relationship with you, then I can start saying, hey, Echo,

368
00:25:00.68 --> 00:25:02.68
if you thought about doing this, it's a little bit different over here.

369
00:25:02.68 --> 00:25:03.68
And hey, Echo, what about this?

370
00:25:03.68 --> 00:25:05.68
And hey, Echo, this other company that we own does it this way,

371
00:25:05.68 --> 00:25:07.68
and it's really efficient.

372
00:25:07.68 --> 00:25:12.68
Would you consider maybe seeing how that would work inside your, with your team?

373
00:25:12.68 --> 00:25:13.68
Yeah.

374
00:25:13.68 --> 00:25:16.68
And so I would slowly move, but for me to come in and say, okay, Echo,

375
00:25:16.68 --> 00:25:17.68
we just close the deal.

376
00:25:17.68 --> 00:25:19.68
Here's the new, yes.

377
00:25:19.68 --> 00:25:23.68
That's when you go, hey, you go to your troops and say, I don't know if this is a good call.

378
00:25:23.68 --> 00:25:25.68
And I don't know, these guys think they know everything,

379
00:25:25.68 --> 00:25:27.68
and now it's something we got to rebel you know, in our hands.

380
00:25:27.68 --> 00:25:28.68
Yep.

381
00:25:28.68 --> 00:25:29.68
So now I might have to crush it.

382
00:25:29.68 --> 00:25:30.68
Right.

383
00:25:30.68 --> 00:25:33.68
The whole idea of crushing seems pretty old school.

384
00:25:33.68 --> 00:25:34.68
Yeah.

385
00:25:34.68 --> 00:25:35.68
Yeah.

386
00:25:35.68 --> 00:25:39.68
So in and as he said, when once you crush something,

387
00:25:39.68 --> 00:25:42.68
well, then you got to invest all kinds of things in it too.

388
00:25:42.68 --> 00:25:44.68
Like hey, so let's say, let's say I bought your company,

389
00:25:44.68 --> 00:25:48.68
and then you, you know, you rebel against me, so I fired you.

390
00:25:48.68 --> 00:25:49.68
Well, now I got to bring someone up.

391
00:25:49.68 --> 00:25:52.68
I got to find someone that understands your business and the intricacies your business.

392
00:25:52.68 --> 00:25:53.68
And guess what, that's not easy.

393
00:25:53.68 --> 00:25:54.68
And guess what?

394
00:25:54.68 --> 00:25:55.68
Now I got to invest all this time in myself,

395
00:25:55.68 --> 00:25:58.68
and I got to bring some some contractors in there to help out.

396
00:25:58.68 --> 00:26:00.68
I'm next thing you know, I'm upside down.

397
00:26:00.68 --> 00:26:01.68
Yeah.

398
00:26:01.68 --> 00:26:04.68
Where's if I had just done a good deal with you and, you know,

399
00:26:04.68 --> 00:26:09.68
kind of let you run things for a while and let build a relationships that you actually would want to listen to me.

400
00:26:09.68 --> 00:26:10.68
That's different. That's better.

401
00:26:10.68 --> 00:26:11.68
Yeah.

402
00:26:11.68 --> 00:26:15.68
So yes, the idea of crushing people generally,

403
00:26:15.68 --> 00:26:18.68
it's your, it's not the preferred method.

404
00:26:18.68 --> 00:26:19.68
It's not ideal.

405
00:26:19.68 --> 00:26:20.68
Generally.

406
00:26:20.68 --> 00:26:21.68
Sometimes it's required.

407
00:26:21.68 --> 00:26:23.68
Yes. Sometimes people need to get destroyed.

408
00:26:23.68 --> 00:26:25.68
That's the way it is.

409
00:26:25.68 --> 00:26:25.68
Yeah.

410
00:26:25.68 --> 00:26:27.68
And when that's the way cool.

411
00:26:27.68 --> 00:26:28.68
That's how I like it.

412
00:26:28.68 --> 00:26:28.68
Lock the load.

413
00:26:28.68 --> 00:26:29.68
Destroy it.

414
00:26:29.68 --> 00:26:32.68
Did you watch football or do you watch football?

415
00:26:32.68 --> 00:26:34.68
I don't watch football. I don't watch football.

416
00:26:34.68 --> 00:26:36.68
If you run, a lot is he's old school.

417
00:26:36.68 --> 00:26:37.68
Yes.

418
00:26:37.68 --> 00:26:38.68
I do know what he's doing.

419
00:26:38.68 --> 00:26:40.68
40 minors back in the year.

420
00:26:40.68 --> 00:26:40.68
Yeah.

421
00:26:40.68 --> 00:26:42.68
I don't know if this true, but it's a rumor.

422
00:26:42.68 --> 00:26:44.68
I don't know. This is what I heard when I was young.

423
00:26:44.68 --> 00:26:46.68
Where he would like, he broke his finger.

424
00:26:46.68 --> 00:26:46.68
Hmm.

425
00:26:46.68 --> 00:26:47.68
He's pinkier.

426
00:26:47.68 --> 00:26:48.68
I don't know.

427
00:26:48.68 --> 00:26:49.68
One of his fingers. He broke it.

428
00:26:49.68 --> 00:26:51.68
And, you know, he's trying to, you know, play.

429
00:26:51.68 --> 00:26:53.68
You got to play his professional football players.

430
00:26:53.68 --> 00:26:54.68
So he can't just be out because you're finger.

431
00:26:54.68 --> 00:26:55.68
So he play.

432
00:26:55.68 --> 00:26:57.68
You tape it up in a cap just getting jammed up.

433
00:26:57.68 --> 00:26:58.68
Hmm.

434
00:26:58.68 --> 00:26:59.68
So he just cut it off.

435
00:26:59.68 --> 00:27:00.68
Yeah.

436
00:27:00.68 --> 00:27:02.68
I don't know if you can see it.

437
00:27:02.68 --> 00:27:03.68
Yeah.

438
00:27:03.68 --> 00:27:04.68
Yeah.

439
00:27:04.68 --> 00:27:06.68
Get rid of the finger, but you don't have a finger.

440
00:27:06.68 --> 00:27:08.68
But if the thing is, like, you know,

441
00:27:08.68 --> 00:27:11.68
jamming you up too much by being there, then you got to craft it.

442
00:27:11.68 --> 00:27:14.68
I heard a story, similar story about Valige.

443
00:27:14.68 --> 00:27:16.68
Valige is male.

444
00:27:16.68 --> 00:27:17.68
You know what?

445
00:27:17.68 --> 00:27:18.68
The jujitsu player?

446
00:27:18.68 --> 00:27:19.68
Yeah.

447
00:27:19.68 --> 00:27:20.68
Crazy.

448
00:27:20.68 --> 00:27:21.68
Jujitsu player.

449
00:27:21.68 --> 00:27:21.68
Great jujitsu player.

450
00:27:21.68 --> 00:27:23.68
But he had crazy, colleague flower ears.

451
00:27:23.68 --> 00:27:24.68
Yeah.

452
00:27:24.68 --> 00:27:29.68
They just look like two, two, half ten, half baseball ball.

453
00:27:29.68 --> 00:27:31.68
And he just got a little bit of a hammer inside of his head.

454
00:27:31.68 --> 00:27:32.68
Yeah.

455
00:27:32.68 --> 00:27:34.68
And I heard a story about him that he was just asking the doctor

456
00:27:34.68 --> 00:27:35.68
just caught him off.

457
00:27:35.68 --> 00:27:36.68
Just caught him off.

458
00:27:36.68 --> 00:27:37.68
Just get rid of him.

459
00:27:37.68 --> 00:27:38.68
No use.

460
00:27:38.68 --> 00:27:40.68
All they do is cause me problems.

461
00:27:40.68 --> 00:27:41.68
Just get rid of him.

462
00:27:41.68 --> 00:27:41.68
Yeah.

463
00:27:41.68 --> 00:27:42.68
So he's that kind.

464
00:27:42.68 --> 00:27:44.68
Is that kind of a hardcore kind of?

465
00:27:44.68 --> 00:27:45.68
Yeah.

466
00:27:45.68 --> 00:27:47.68
Because I'm sure the, well, then again,

467
00:27:47.68 --> 00:27:49.68
I guess it depends on the problems, right?

468
00:27:49.68 --> 00:27:51.68
And because that's what they're using.

469
00:27:51.68 --> 00:27:52.68
What do your ears do for you?

470
00:27:52.68 --> 00:27:56.68
I guess they catch some sound and bring it into your ears.

471
00:27:56.68 --> 00:27:57.68
Yes.

472
00:27:57.68 --> 00:28:00.68
That's not hunting, right?

473
00:28:00.68 --> 00:28:03.68
And you don't necessarily need to hear super well.

474
00:28:03.68 --> 00:28:05.68
And by the way, I want you to have cauliflower ears.

475
00:28:05.68 --> 00:28:07.68
And it starts going into your ear a little bit.

476
00:28:07.68 --> 00:28:07.68
Yes.

477
00:28:07.68 --> 00:28:10.68
That's not good either for your hearing.

478
00:28:10.68 --> 00:28:11.68
So he's hearing might improve.

479
00:28:11.68 --> 00:28:12.68
Just get rid of those things.

480
00:28:12.68 --> 00:28:15.68
Yeah, I guess they've been so bad as comfortable.

481
00:28:15.68 --> 00:28:17.68
You know what I'm saying?

482
00:28:17.68 --> 00:28:18.68
Yeah.

483
00:28:18.68 --> 00:28:19.68
I didn't know what you're saying.

484
00:28:19.68 --> 00:28:19.68
Yeah.

485
00:28:19.68 --> 00:28:21.68
The, you know, cutting off your ears is a lot more

486
00:28:21.68 --> 00:28:24.68
that goes into that than a finger, I think,

487
00:28:24.68 --> 00:28:25.68
because, you know, I don't know.

488
00:28:25.68 --> 00:28:29.68
I mean, on a social level, you know, you get a guy with ears cut off on purpose, by the way.

489
00:28:29.68 --> 00:28:31.68
It's kind of like, okay.

490
00:28:31.68 --> 00:28:32.68
Yeah, I don't know.

491
00:28:32.68 --> 00:28:33.68
I like a little bit next level.

492
00:28:33.68 --> 00:28:35.68
Let's say you're a girl and you're like, hey, mom,

493
00:28:35.68 --> 00:28:35.68
I'm dead.

494
00:28:35.68 --> 00:28:37.68
But it might never have you never thought about, like,

495
00:28:37.68 --> 00:28:39.68
if you've read a cauliflower ear?

496
00:28:39.68 --> 00:28:40.68
No, okay.

497
00:28:40.68 --> 00:28:42.68
Sometimes when you get cauliflower ear,

498
00:28:42.68 --> 00:28:44.68
and it's preventing you from training,

499
00:28:44.68 --> 00:28:47.68
there's no doubt that the thought goes through your mind, like, you know what?

500
00:28:47.68 --> 00:28:49.68
Hey, I'm in the game.

501
00:28:49.68 --> 00:28:51.68
You know, these things aren't doing me much good.

502
00:28:51.68 --> 00:28:52.68
Let me just get rid of these.

503
00:28:52.68 --> 00:28:53.68
Yes.

504
00:28:53.68 --> 00:28:56.68
I could see how that could be, I guess,

505
00:28:56.68 --> 00:28:58.68
but sorry, man, I can't get there.

506
00:28:58.68 --> 00:28:59.68
No, with the ears.

507
00:28:59.68 --> 00:29:01.68
Maybe the fingers, I dig the fingers.

508
00:29:01.68 --> 00:29:01.68
I'm sure.

509
00:29:01.68 --> 00:29:05.68
See, to me, so you can't, there's certain things you can't do if you lose your fingers.

510
00:29:05.68 --> 00:29:06.68
I eat play guitar.

511
00:29:06.68 --> 00:29:07.68
Yeah, you can.

512
00:29:07.68 --> 00:29:08.68
So I'd be a problem then, Jim.

513
00:29:08.68 --> 00:29:11.68
Yeah, so I keep the fingers more than the ears.

514
00:29:11.68 --> 00:29:13.68
You know, I'll get your voice back.

515
00:29:13.68 --> 00:29:14.68
You're the fingers.

516
00:29:14.68 --> 00:29:16.68
I don't mind.

517
00:29:16.68 --> 00:29:17.68
You know what?

518
00:29:17.68 --> 00:29:21.68
You're more sensitive to your appearance, I think, than I am.

519
00:29:21.68 --> 00:29:23.68
aesthetically conscious.

520
00:29:23.68 --> 00:29:24.68
Yeah, yeah.

521
00:29:24.68 --> 00:29:26.68
Yeah, yeah, I would agree with that, sir.

522
00:29:26.68 --> 00:29:27.68
Yes.

523
00:29:27.68 --> 00:29:28.68
I dig so.

524
00:29:28.68 --> 00:29:29.68
So you get your ears.

525
00:29:29.68 --> 00:29:30.68
I'm keeping my fingers.

526
00:29:30.68 --> 00:29:32.68
Yeah, so I'll hammer on that, give box.

527
00:29:32.68 --> 00:29:33.68
Deal.

528
00:29:33.68 --> 00:29:34.68
Check.

529
00:29:34.68 --> 00:29:36.68
Well, that went off the rails a little bit.

530
00:29:36.68 --> 00:29:37.68
Mm-hmm.

531
00:29:37.68 --> 00:29:38.68
That's right.

532
00:29:38.68 --> 00:29:39.68
All right.

533
00:29:39.68 --> 00:29:41.68
Going back to the book,

534
00:29:41.68 --> 00:29:46.68
a wise man always to follow the paths beaten by great men

535
00:29:46.68 --> 00:29:49.68
and to imitate those who have been supreme.

536
00:29:49.68 --> 00:29:54.68
So that if his ability does not equal theirs, at least it will save

537
00:29:54.68 --> 00:29:55.68
of it.

538
00:29:55.68 --> 00:29:58.68
Let him act like the clever archers.

539
00:29:58.68 --> 00:29:59.68
Who?

540
00:29:59.68 --> 00:30:00.68
This is a good little statement.

541
00:30:00.68 --> 00:30:03.68
Let him act like the clever archers.

542
00:30:03.68 --> 00:30:06.68
Who designed to hit the mark which yet appears too far

543
00:30:06.68 --> 00:30:09.68
distant and knowing the limits to which the strength of their

544
00:30:09.68 --> 00:30:14.68
bow attains, tank, take aim much higher than the mark.

545
00:30:14.68 --> 00:30:18.68
Not to reach them by their strength or arrow to so great a height.

546
00:30:18.68 --> 00:30:23.68
But to be able to with the aid of so high and aim hit the mark they

547
00:30:23.68 --> 00:30:26.68
which they wish to reach.

548
00:30:26.68 --> 00:30:29.68
That's a very clever way of putting it.

549
00:30:29.68 --> 00:30:30.68
Yeah.

550
00:30:30.68 --> 00:30:32.68
Hey, look, if I don't think I can hit this mark,

551
00:30:32.68 --> 00:30:34.68
I'm just going to aim a little bit higher.

552
00:30:34.68 --> 00:30:37.68
And then even though I might not reach the highest mark,

553
00:30:37.68 --> 00:30:39.68
I'll at least hit the mark.

554
00:30:39.68 --> 00:30:41.68
I'll get where I want to be.

555
00:30:41.68 --> 00:30:42.68
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fully.

556
00:30:42.68 --> 00:30:44.68
That's a good way to go through life.

557
00:30:44.68 --> 00:30:45.68
Yeah, there's a lot of that.

558
00:30:45.68 --> 00:30:47.68
I mean, that's, you know, that's a,

559
00:30:47.68 --> 00:30:51.68
the tactic technique, whatever, and like a lot of things like

560
00:30:51.68 --> 00:30:52.68
negotiation.

561
00:30:52.68 --> 00:30:54.68
They say they do the same thing, right?

562
00:30:54.68 --> 00:30:57.68
Okay, I want to get, you know, I don't know, you go job interview

563
00:30:57.68 --> 00:30:58.68
whatever.

564
00:30:58.68 --> 00:31:01.68
I want to make 100,000, so I'm going to ask for like 120.

565
00:31:01.68 --> 00:31:04.68
He's going to negotiate down and I get my 100.

566
00:31:04.68 --> 00:31:05.68
No, that's, that's true.

567
00:31:05.68 --> 00:31:08.68
Where this thing I think sometimes people get this out of hand

568
00:31:08.68 --> 00:31:12.68
is it'll be like a sales organization.

569
00:31:12.68 --> 00:31:15.68
And they'll say, you know, they want to bring in.

570
00:31:15.68 --> 00:31:19.68
They want to do $5 million worth of sales in the next month.

571
00:31:19.68 --> 00:31:21.68
And so they say, okay, guys, is what we're going to do.

572
00:31:21.68 --> 00:31:22.68
10 million.

573
00:31:22.68 --> 00:31:24.68
And they said an unrealistic goal.

574
00:31:24.68 --> 00:31:27.68
We said an unrealistic goal that's not achievable.

575
00:31:27.68 --> 00:31:29.68
It's basically a meaningless goal.

576
00:31:29.68 --> 00:31:33.68
So you have to, you have to aim a little bit high, but it's got to be realistic.

577
00:31:33.68 --> 00:31:34.68
Yeah.

578
00:31:34.68 --> 00:31:35.68
Yeah.

579
00:31:35.68 --> 00:31:38.68
And I would think, you know, I'm just going off how I felt right there

580
00:31:38.68 --> 00:31:42.68
when you said that, you know, someone said to us unrealistic goal,

581
00:31:42.68 --> 00:31:45.68
especially for you, that includes you, you know,

582
00:31:45.68 --> 00:31:50.68
where like the failure of reaching that goal is kind of, you're partly your failure.

583
00:31:50.68 --> 00:31:53.68
I think you'd kind of decrease my enthusiasm.

584
00:31:53.68 --> 00:31:54.68
I've put in a sample.

585
00:31:54.68 --> 00:31:55.68
Yeah.

586
00:31:55.68 --> 00:31:56.68
You need it.

587
00:31:56.68 --> 00:31:59.68
That's why people need to be very careful in how they set their goals.

588
00:31:59.68 --> 00:32:01.68
That they set them high enough that it,

589
00:32:01.68 --> 00:32:03.68
you try and get to it.

590
00:32:03.68 --> 00:32:05.68
And maybe you don't quite get there.

591
00:32:05.68 --> 00:32:06.68
Because let's face it.

592
00:32:06.68 --> 00:32:08.68
If you set a goal and you just easily make it,

593
00:32:08.68 --> 00:32:10.68
you should have set your goal a little bit higher.

594
00:32:10.68 --> 00:32:13.68
So if you set a goal and it's not even close,

595
00:32:13.68 --> 00:32:14.68
no one even tries.

596
00:32:14.68 --> 00:32:15.68
Yeah.

597
00:32:15.68 --> 00:32:17.68
So you got to set a realistic goal.

598
00:32:17.68 --> 00:32:18.68
Yeah.

599
00:32:18.68 --> 00:32:20.68
Otherwise, not going to work well.

600
00:32:20.68 --> 00:32:21.68
Yeah.

601
00:32:21.68 --> 00:32:22.68
And like people will be like,

602
00:32:22.68 --> 00:32:27.68
let's especially at work when people start setting goals all crazy.

603
00:32:27.68 --> 00:32:28.68
Yeah.

604
00:32:28.68 --> 00:32:29.68
That's what I was talking about.

605
00:32:29.68 --> 00:32:30.68
Yeah.

606
00:32:30.68 --> 00:32:33.68
But, well, I was just watching the movie Major League.

607
00:32:33.68 --> 00:32:34.68
Remember that one?

608
00:32:34.68 --> 00:32:35.68
Oh, the first one.

609
00:32:35.68 --> 00:32:36.68
I tried to remember what it was about.

610
00:32:36.68 --> 00:32:37.68
And they were like baseball.

611
00:32:37.68 --> 00:32:39.68
It was this thing where they,

612
00:32:39.68 --> 00:32:43.68
they, they, the owner was trying to like sell the team or something.

613
00:32:43.68 --> 00:32:47.68
But for her to do that, they had to like lose all the games.

614
00:32:47.68 --> 00:32:48.68
Or something like that.

615
00:32:48.68 --> 00:32:52.68
And if they didn't lose and she would just replace the players with other players who would lose.

616
00:32:52.68 --> 00:32:53.68
You know, kind of thing.

617
00:32:53.68 --> 00:32:57.68
So it was, so everyone was all down about it.

618
00:32:57.68 --> 00:33:00.68
And the guy was like, well, there's only one thing to do with the whole thing.

619
00:33:00.68 --> 00:33:03.68
You know, like that, right, which is a, I dig it.

620
00:33:03.68 --> 00:33:04.68
Right.

621
00:33:04.68 --> 00:33:06.68
But at like a regular job,

622
00:33:06.68 --> 00:33:10.68
well, it was for the movie too, obviously. So you got to have an inspirational story line.

623
00:33:10.68 --> 00:33:14.68
But anyway, at your job, you know, let's say there's numbers week earlier.

624
00:33:14.68 --> 00:33:17.68
And then it's like, okay, dang, you're making me meet these crazy numbers.

625
00:33:17.68 --> 00:33:18.68
And they're unrealistic.

626
00:33:18.68 --> 00:33:20.68
They're above the normal good goal.

627
00:33:20.68 --> 00:33:21.68
They're way above.

628
00:33:21.68 --> 00:33:23.68
So it's like, okay, what does this mean now?

629
00:33:23.68 --> 00:33:25.68
Now, like, probably can't spend time with my family.

630
00:33:25.68 --> 00:33:29.68
Okay, now you're going to freaking dry us into the ground, working and do all this stuff.

631
00:33:29.68 --> 00:33:30.68
Whatever.

632
00:33:30.68 --> 00:33:33.68
Going against my interests, you know, as a human being.

633
00:33:33.68 --> 00:33:36.68
So I'm going to feel junk about that. I'm not going to like that.

634
00:33:36.68 --> 00:33:38.68
No, no one does. That's my point.

635
00:33:38.68 --> 00:33:40.68
Even no one likes in the business world.

636
00:33:40.68 --> 00:33:41.68
And no one liked it.

637
00:33:41.68 --> 00:33:42.68
It made you leave either.

638
00:33:42.68 --> 00:33:44.68
It's a well, that's, you know, different.

639
00:33:44.68 --> 00:33:45.68
They did like it.

640
00:33:45.68 --> 00:33:46.68
Check.

641
00:33:46.68 --> 00:33:48.68
All right, moving on.

642
00:33:48.68 --> 00:33:56.68
Now, as the fact of becoming a prince from private station presupposes either ability or fortune.

643
00:33:56.68 --> 00:34:00.68
And he's the word forchalot to mean like pretty much luck.

644
00:34:00.68 --> 00:34:07.68
It is clear that one or the other of these things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties.

645
00:34:07.68 --> 00:34:13.68
Nevertheless, he was relied least on fortune is established the strongest.

646
00:34:13.68 --> 00:34:17.68
Makes sense. So when you, when you're in a leadership position, if you got there because you're lucky,

647
00:34:17.68 --> 00:34:20.68
it's going to be harder for you to maintain good position as a leader.

648
00:34:20.68 --> 00:34:22.68
You got there because of your skill.

649
00:34:22.68 --> 00:34:24.68
And what's the other thing he says?

650
00:34:24.68 --> 00:34:27.68
Because your ability, if you get there because your ability, people will respect you more.

651
00:34:27.68 --> 00:34:31.68
They're just, you just got there by luck.

652
00:34:31.68 --> 00:34:40.68
Those who by valorous ways become princes acquire a principality with difficulty, but they keep it with ease.

653
00:34:40.68 --> 00:34:46.68
The difficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules and method methods,

654
00:34:46.68 --> 00:34:51.68
which they are forced to introduce to establish their government and its security.

655
00:34:51.68 --> 00:34:56.68
So when you have a hard time getting into power and you do it by boldness, once you're there,

656
00:34:56.68 --> 00:35:00.68
it's going to be easier for you to do it because you had to make all these maneuvers.

657
00:35:00.68 --> 00:35:02.68
You had to figure things out in order to get there.

658
00:35:02.68 --> 00:35:06.68
Continuing, and it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult.

659
00:35:06.68 --> 00:35:11.68
This is a good one. There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct,

660
00:35:11.68 --> 00:35:19.68
or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.

661
00:35:19.68 --> 00:35:24.68
So there's nothing harder than trying to come in and introduce a new order of things, nothing harder than that.

662
00:35:24.68 --> 00:35:32.68
And here's the reasons, because the innovator has for enemies, all those who have done well under the old conditions,

663
00:35:32.68 --> 00:35:38.68
and Luke warm defenders in those who may do well under the new.

664
00:35:38.68 --> 00:35:42.68
So you get people that are entrenched at like, hey man, we've been doing this for 20 years, I'm not changing it.

665
00:35:42.68 --> 00:35:45.68
And he got someone else saying, well, it could work better.

666
00:35:45.68 --> 00:35:50.68
That's like, it's not a good comparison. It's not a fair fight.

667
00:35:50.68 --> 00:35:56.68
Because those people that are already know at works, they know at works. They got someone that I think the new thing will work.

668
00:35:56.68 --> 00:35:58.68
It's a mismatch.

669
00:35:58.68 --> 00:36:06.68
Continuing on, this coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents who have the walls on their side,

670
00:36:06.68 --> 00:36:19.68
and partly from the incredulity of men who do not readily believe in new things until they have had long experience of them.

671
00:36:19.68 --> 00:36:27.68
So you get people that have been doing this forever, like I just said, you got someone that hasn't really figured out if this new thing is going to work, and it's just a mismatch.

672
00:36:27.68 --> 00:36:35.68
So there's skeptical.

673
00:36:35.68 --> 00:36:43.68
Continuing, those who solely by good fortune become princes from being private citizens have little trouble in rising,

674
00:36:43.68 --> 00:36:51.68
but much trouble in keeping a top. They have not had any difficulties on the way up because they fly.

675
00:36:51.68 --> 00:36:55.68
But they have many when they reach the summit. This is a good one.

676
00:36:55.68 --> 00:37:02.68
The people that kind of get lucky and end up in a senior position in a leadership position, they got lucky.

677
00:37:02.68 --> 00:37:06.68
And so there's no trouble getting there, they got lucky. They flew there.

678
00:37:06.68 --> 00:37:17.68
But then he says they have trouble when they reach the summit. Continue on, such are those to whom some state is given either for money or by favor of him who bestows it.

679
00:37:17.68 --> 00:37:22.68
So, you know, you see this going through Buds actually.

680
00:37:22.68 --> 00:37:29.68
There's some people that were like incredible athletes, and they never failed anything before in their life,

681
00:37:29.68 --> 00:37:33.68
and all of us and they show up and they start failing things, and it breaks them.

682
00:37:33.68 --> 00:37:36.68
Or they're great athletes going through Buds.

683
00:37:36.68 --> 00:37:39.68
And it's because if you're a great athlete, well, and Buds is kind of easy.

684
00:37:39.68 --> 00:37:44.68
And then you show up at a sealed team, things aren't easy because it's not just athletics in the sealed team.

685
00:37:44.68 --> 00:37:46.68
It's not an athletic game in the sealed team.

686
00:37:46.68 --> 00:37:50.68
As a matter of fact, I was just talking about this the other day.

687
00:37:50.68 --> 00:37:56.68
The athletic capability of a seal or of a special operation.

688
00:37:56.68 --> 00:38:04.68
It's like, sure, you get some great athletes in there, but you put on a rock sack and hump, you know, ten kilometers.

689
00:38:04.68 --> 00:38:07.68
That's not an athletically gifted.

690
00:38:07.68 --> 00:38:16.68
You as an athletic, it's not an athletic skill test, you know, it's not like, yeah, you got to be a good shape for sure.

691
00:38:16.68 --> 00:38:22.68
But whether this guy played college football and this guy didn't,

692
00:38:22.68 --> 00:38:26.68
you put on that rock sack and start humpin', you can't tell who's who.

693
00:38:26.68 --> 00:38:27.68
Yeah.

694
00:38:27.68 --> 00:38:29.68
You know, occasionally you might be able to.

695
00:38:29.68 --> 00:38:37.68
You got to, you can make some assumptions at the athletic football player, you know, he's an athletic person, but it's not an athletic game.

696
00:38:37.68 --> 00:38:38.68
Yeah.

697
00:38:38.68 --> 00:38:40.68
The same with like shooting.

698
00:38:40.68 --> 00:38:43.68
Look, okay, you get some of that's got great hand, good eye coordination.

699
00:38:43.68 --> 00:38:45.68
They're probably going to be a pretty good shot.

700
00:38:45.68 --> 00:38:46.68
Not necessarily though.

701
00:38:46.68 --> 00:38:50.68
I knew some guys that were great athletes, weren't good shots.

702
00:38:50.68 --> 00:38:51.68
Yeah.

703
00:38:51.68 --> 00:38:52.68
And vice versa.

704
00:38:52.68 --> 00:38:56.68
You see some guys that were great athletes and they were great shots, they had great hand eye coordination.

705
00:38:56.68 --> 00:39:00.68
So it's not really, there's not really this athletic challenge.

706
00:39:00.68 --> 00:39:08.68
So my point is you get someone that sails through buds because they're a great athlete, because buds is more of an athletic pursuit.

707
00:39:08.68 --> 00:39:10.68
I mean, it's like, okay, you got to run.

708
00:39:10.68 --> 00:39:11.68
You got to do pull ups.

709
00:39:11.68 --> 00:39:12.68
You got to do the opposite course.

710
00:39:12.68 --> 00:39:15.68
There's more athleticism involved in getting through buds.

711
00:39:15.68 --> 00:39:19.68
Once you get through buds, then it's like, oh, you have to think.

712
00:39:19.68 --> 00:39:23.68
You have to gut through hard things while you're thinking.

713
00:39:23.68 --> 00:39:27.68
So there's some guys that I went through with, like, a little tripped up when they got to the teams.

714
00:39:27.68 --> 00:39:31.68
Even though they did not have a hard time at all with buds, they got to the teams.

715
00:39:31.68 --> 00:39:37.68
They got tripped up on things because they just, they just kind of got in their own way.

716
00:39:37.68 --> 00:39:38.68
You know, unfortunately.

717
00:39:38.68 --> 00:39:44.68
Good, good guys, hard guys, but you just think, man, just you need to think a little bit more.

718
00:39:44.68 --> 00:39:45.68
Yeah.

719
00:39:45.68 --> 00:39:51.68
Feeling with certain mental anguish while you do other things.

720
00:39:51.68 --> 00:39:51.68
Yeah.

721
00:39:51.68 --> 00:39:52.68
Feeling with it.

722
00:39:52.68 --> 00:39:53.68
Yeah.

723
00:39:53.68 --> 00:39:55.68
You got to make decisions when you're tired.

724
00:39:55.68 --> 00:39:56.68
Yeah.

725
00:39:56.68 --> 00:39:57.68
You got to stay awake when you're tired.

726
00:39:57.68 --> 00:40:00.68
You got to, yeah, like all those things.

727
00:40:00.68 --> 00:40:02.68
Oh, there's stress going on and you're freaking out.

728
00:40:02.68 --> 00:40:05.68
Well, that's what you still got to decide that you got to make something happen.

729
00:40:05.68 --> 00:40:06.68
And then you got to go do it.

730
00:40:06.68 --> 00:40:07.68
Yeah.

731
00:40:07.68 --> 00:40:10.68
Which easy to just go curl up in a ball.

732
00:40:10.68 --> 00:40:11.68
Right?

733
00:40:11.68 --> 00:40:11.68
No.

734
00:40:11.68 --> 00:40:12.68
Take a nap.

735
00:40:12.68 --> 00:40:13.68
Yeah.

736
00:40:13.68 --> 00:40:14.68
Yeah.

737
00:40:14.68 --> 00:40:22.68
Continuing such and he's talking about these people that were kind of given luck or bought their way into their positions.

738
00:40:22.68 --> 00:40:27.68
Such stands simply elevated upon the goodwill and the fortune of him who has elevated them.

739
00:40:27.68 --> 00:40:32.68
Two most inconsistent and unstable things.

740
00:40:32.68 --> 00:40:38.68
Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position because unless they are men of great worth and ability,

741
00:40:38.68 --> 00:40:43.68
does not reasonable to expect that they should know how to command having always lived in private condition.

742
00:40:43.68 --> 00:40:47.68
They're going to get thrown into a leadership position and they haven't done anything to earn their position here.

743
00:40:47.68 --> 00:40:49.68
They're going to mean experience is going to be hard for him.

744
00:40:49.68 --> 00:40:50.68
Yeah.

745
00:40:50.68 --> 00:40:54.68
Same thing with, I mean, maybe you see it now, maybe you don't.

746
00:40:54.68 --> 00:41:01.68
But our, in Gigiitu, where, you know, the, you know, a young guy or whatever, he'll, he'll,

747
00:41:01.68 --> 00:41:05.68
or he'll have a certain body type or I don't know whatever he'll develop like this certain move.

748
00:41:05.68 --> 00:41:06.68
Mm-hmm.

749
00:41:06.68 --> 00:41:08.68
That'll be kind of new, terrible.

750
00:41:08.68 --> 00:41:12.68
Like no one's ever seen this, this system or this move or whatever.

751
00:41:12.68 --> 00:41:18.68
And no get guys, you know, get guys and win tournaments and start winning tournaments and be like,

752
00:41:18.68 --> 00:41:21.68
and that instructs like, dang, this guy's killing these tournaments here.

753
00:41:21.68 --> 00:41:27.68
Let's give him his blue belt, brown belt, you know, all the way up he gets his like brown belt black belt because he wins tournament.

754
00:41:27.68 --> 00:41:28.68
Dang.

755
00:41:28.68 --> 00:41:30.68
More so then because of like his well rounded.

756
00:41:30.68 --> 00:41:32.68
Yes, skill set and knowledge.

757
00:41:32.68 --> 00:41:34.68
So which kind of makes sense, right?

758
00:41:34.68 --> 00:41:39.68
I mean, shoot if he's winning, if he's tapping everyone out in the tournament in, you know,

759
00:41:39.68 --> 00:41:42.68
all the lower belt, of course he can just belt make sense.

760
00:41:42.68 --> 00:41:48.68
But later on, you know, as time goes on and one of the things is like, okay,

761
00:41:48.68 --> 00:41:49.68
they'll just figure out the move.

762
00:41:49.68 --> 00:41:50.68
Yeah.

763
00:41:50.68 --> 00:41:52.68
Figure out the answer to that move, what else is left?

764
00:41:52.68 --> 00:41:53.68
Nothing.

765
00:41:53.68 --> 00:41:56.68
Isn't it crazy that if you know the move?

766
00:41:56.68 --> 00:41:59.68
Like isn't it crazy, Gigiitu, first of all, that if you know how to defend something,

767
00:41:59.68 --> 00:42:00.68
you can stop something.

768
00:42:00.68 --> 00:42:01.68
If you don't know it, you get tapped.

769
00:42:01.68 --> 00:42:03.68
If you know it, you can get out.

770
00:42:03.68 --> 00:42:04.68
Yes.

771
00:42:04.68 --> 00:42:05.68
That's so crazy.

772
00:42:05.68 --> 00:42:08.68
And what's really crazy is that's the way life is.

773
00:42:08.68 --> 00:42:10.68
That's the way leadership is.

774
00:42:10.68 --> 00:42:13.68
Like when I talk to companies and I'll be talking to some leader and I'm like,

775
00:42:13.68 --> 00:42:16.68
Hey, here's what you need to say in a situation like this.

776
00:42:16.68 --> 00:42:20.68
And it's like they can now escape this position that the red because they can,

777
00:42:20.68 --> 00:42:23.68
Oh, oh yeah, here's what you should say.

778
00:42:23.68 --> 00:42:24.68
Yeah.

779
00:42:24.68 --> 00:42:27.68
And they say, oh, you can see it looking their eyes.

780
00:42:27.68 --> 00:42:31.68
And then they'll call me and say, dude, I did that.

781
00:42:31.68 --> 00:42:32.68
Yeah.

782
00:42:32.68 --> 00:42:33.68
You would like it.

783
00:42:33.68 --> 00:42:34.68
The whole team turned around.

784
00:42:34.68 --> 00:42:36.68
So, oh yeah, big shocker.

785
00:42:36.68 --> 00:42:38.68
There's moves that you can make.

786
00:42:38.68 --> 00:42:40.68
There's tactical maneuvers that you can make.

787
00:42:40.68 --> 00:42:44.68
And if you know them, you'll escape the position.

788
00:42:44.68 --> 00:42:46.68
If you don't know them, you'll get destroyed.

789
00:42:46.68 --> 00:42:47.68
Yeah.

790
00:42:47.68 --> 00:42:50.68
And so, to where you're going with this is sometimes somebody develop something

791
00:42:50.68 --> 00:42:52.68
or they get really good at something.

792
00:42:52.68 --> 00:42:56.68
And as soon as some people know it's coming, they can just stop it.

793
00:42:56.68 --> 00:42:58.68
And then all of a sudden they start losing tournaments.

794
00:42:58.68 --> 00:42:59.68
They get to purple belt.

795
00:42:59.68 --> 00:43:00.68
They start losing tournaments.

796
00:43:00.68 --> 00:43:01.68
Yeah, because of that.

797
00:43:01.68 --> 00:43:04.68
And I was going to say, see, it's unrealistic in my opinion,

798
00:43:04.68 --> 00:43:08.68
that someone would be really good at a move and go all the way to black belt.

799
00:43:08.68 --> 00:43:09.68
Based on that move.

800
00:43:09.68 --> 00:43:10.68
That's not realistic.

801
00:43:10.68 --> 00:43:10.68
Yeah.

802
00:43:10.68 --> 00:43:12.68
They'll get somebody, people will figure out,

803
00:43:12.68 --> 00:43:16.68
and they'll have to round out their game before they get brown belt.

804
00:43:16.68 --> 00:43:17.68
Black belt.

805
00:43:17.68 --> 00:43:17.68
Yeah.

806
00:43:17.68 --> 00:43:18.68
Right.

807
00:43:18.68 --> 00:43:19.68
You were getting a little crazy there.

808
00:43:19.68 --> 00:43:20.68
Yeah.

809
00:43:20.68 --> 00:43:22.68
More for the example, but there is this one.

810
00:43:22.68 --> 00:43:24.68
And I don't know the girl's name, but it was,

811
00:43:24.68 --> 00:43:28.68
it was, I don't know the girl's name, but she was a brown belt.

812
00:43:28.68 --> 00:43:29.68
But she had been a brown belt.

813
00:43:29.68 --> 00:43:31.68
Like she took her like two years or so.

814
00:43:31.68 --> 00:43:33.68
It's something super fast.

815
00:43:33.68 --> 00:43:34.68
To get to brown belt.

816
00:43:34.68 --> 00:43:35.68
To get to brown belt.

817
00:43:35.68 --> 00:43:40.68
Because of, if I'm not mistaken, she would do like a reverse triangle all the time.

818
00:43:40.68 --> 00:43:42.68
Maybe a regular triangle, not sure.

819
00:43:42.68 --> 00:43:43.68
And then, I don't know.

820
00:43:43.68 --> 00:43:48.68
Then I think it, I could be getting the names wrong.

821
00:43:48.68 --> 00:43:52.68
But I think it was Penny Thomas, and she ended up fighting for Penny Tom,

822
00:43:52.68 --> 00:43:53.68
some Penny Tom's to be here.

823
00:43:53.68 --> 00:43:56.68
And, you know, the new hotness, the new girl coming up, whatever.

824
00:43:56.68 --> 00:44:02.68
And I think it was Joel, who mentioned like this exact thing that he's talking about.

825
00:44:02.68 --> 00:44:07.68
Where it's like, yeah, like, to be a real brown belt and compete at the top level,

826
00:44:07.68 --> 00:44:10.68
you've got to have a well-rounded game, essentially.

827
00:44:10.68 --> 00:44:13.68
You know, because you can't just, you can't just like what you said.

828
00:44:13.68 --> 00:44:16.68
Like, you make it up to brown and black for a reason.

829
00:44:16.68 --> 00:44:18.68
Brown and black belt, you can't just do it with one move.

830
00:44:18.68 --> 00:44:19.68
Yeah.

831
00:44:19.68 --> 00:44:20.68
Because that's not what a brown belt is.

832
00:44:20.68 --> 00:44:25.68
And that's what, when you get someone that's really good, they know about all the different moves.

833
00:44:25.68 --> 00:44:26.68
Yeah.

834
00:44:26.68 --> 00:44:27.68
It always surprised me.

835
00:44:27.68 --> 00:44:31.68
Dean will be able to answer a question about moves that he doesn't actually do in a normal basis.

836
00:44:31.68 --> 00:44:32.68
Yeah.

837
00:44:32.68 --> 00:44:33.68
Like, yeah.

838
00:44:33.68 --> 00:44:34.68
He knows exactly how to do it.

839
00:44:34.68 --> 00:44:35.68
He knows how to defend it.

840
00:44:35.68 --> 00:44:38.68
He knows how to set it up, but he doesn't actually do that move.

841
00:44:38.68 --> 00:44:41.68
And that's how good you got to be.

842
00:44:41.68 --> 00:44:42.68
Yeah.

843
00:44:42.68 --> 00:44:49.68
The other weird thing is, you catch someone like Dean in a position that's totally new.

844
00:44:49.68 --> 00:44:53.68
You know, to some random, and he actually knows like a thing to do to get out of it.

845
00:44:53.68 --> 00:44:54.68
Right.

846
00:44:54.68 --> 00:44:55.68
You know?

847
00:44:55.68 --> 00:44:56.68
Yeah.

848
00:44:56.68 --> 00:44:58.68
And you think, how do you, like, how do you know that?

849
00:44:58.68 --> 00:44:59.68
Yeah.

850
00:44:59.68 --> 00:45:01.68
And we're like, like, leg ride position.

851
00:45:01.68 --> 00:45:04.68
He's like, oh, if you turn your knee outward and then you pinch your ankles, you'll, you'll,

852
00:45:04.68 --> 00:45:05.68
it'll make them adjust.

853
00:45:05.68 --> 00:45:08.68
Then you can come up on the arm and you can get out and you're like, wait.

854
00:45:08.68 --> 00:45:09.68
Yeah.

855
00:45:09.68 --> 00:45:10.68
How do you know that?

856
00:45:10.68 --> 00:45:11.68
I've never been in this position.

857
00:45:11.68 --> 00:45:12.68
I've been doing this for 25 years.

858
00:45:12.68 --> 00:45:13.68
I've never been in this position before.

859
00:45:13.68 --> 00:45:16.68
Now you're telling me that this is just, you know this.

860
00:45:16.68 --> 00:45:17.68
That's right.

861
00:45:17.68 --> 00:45:20.68
And he probably, some of these positions, he's probably never been in.

862
00:45:20.68 --> 00:45:26.68
It's like, codes, like, writing code, where if you kind of know the certain, like, general rules to things,

863
00:45:26.68 --> 00:45:28.68
you can start figuring out, you know?

864
00:45:28.68 --> 00:45:32.68
Like, and someone like Dean, who's like, I mean, Dean, that should, you know, but that's a thing.

865
00:45:32.68 --> 00:45:36.68
There's a difference between what I'm talking about because what I'm talking about is he actually knows

866
00:45:36.68 --> 00:45:42.68
specifically he's not like, hey, here's what would work based on the general rules of grappling.

867
00:45:42.68 --> 00:45:47.68
He's like, no, here's what you do in this specific situation.

868
00:45:47.68 --> 00:45:49.68
That is weird.

869
00:45:49.68 --> 00:45:50.68
Yeah.

870
00:45:50.68 --> 00:45:52.68
But that's just completely well rounded.

871
00:45:52.68 --> 00:45:53.68
Yeah.

872
00:45:53.68 --> 00:45:54.68
That's just completely well rounded.

873
00:45:54.68 --> 00:45:57.68
So you're saying that at some point he, he has had that experience with that moon.

874
00:45:57.68 --> 00:45:59.68
Yes, he's one where another.

875
00:45:59.68 --> 00:46:00.68
Yeah.

876
00:46:00.68 --> 00:46:05.68
Done it somewhere another and he said, oh, or he's done a much narrower approach of what you're talking about.

877
00:46:05.68 --> 00:46:09.68
Like he is not maybe not that exact thing, but it's so close that he's like, here's what happens.

878
00:46:09.68 --> 00:46:11.68
And here's what's going on.

879
00:46:11.68 --> 00:46:12.68
Yeah.

880
00:46:12.68 --> 00:46:13.68
It's like, yeah.

881
00:46:13.68 --> 00:46:14.68
Similar, but not the same.

882
00:46:14.68 --> 00:46:16.68
Like he goes beyond just having the principles.

883
00:46:16.68 --> 00:46:18.68
It's like principles coupled with experience.

884
00:46:18.68 --> 00:46:19.68
Yes.

885
00:46:19.68 --> 00:46:20.68
Yeah.

886
00:46:20.68 --> 00:46:20.68
Yeah.

887
00:46:20.68 --> 00:46:21.68
Coupled with knowledge.

888
00:46:21.68 --> 00:46:22.68
Yeah.

889
00:46:22.68 --> 00:46:25.68
And Dean's mind for that is really, it's crazy.

890
00:46:25.68 --> 00:46:26.68
It's uncanny.

891
00:46:26.68 --> 00:46:30.68
You know, with that, as far as like his knowledge and what he can sort of figure out, I would have.

892
00:46:30.68 --> 00:46:36.68
It's almost like while you're doing what you do during the day, he's like in a room just thinking about it.

893
00:46:36.68 --> 00:46:37.68
You would think.

894
00:46:37.68 --> 00:46:38.68
You would think that.

895
00:46:38.68 --> 00:46:43.68
You would think that he's sitting around with like four screens, like YouTube screens.

896
00:46:43.68 --> 00:46:45.68
And he's watching different things at once.

897
00:46:45.68 --> 00:46:52.68
And then he has some sort of like weird control where he can get view different angles and help

898
00:46:52.68 --> 00:46:57.68
him. But no, he has a weird because I know he doesn't do that.

899
00:46:57.68 --> 00:46:58.68
Yeah.

900
00:46:58.68 --> 00:47:00.68
He used to do it though.

901
00:47:00.68 --> 00:47:03.68
But he has a weird.

902
00:47:03.68 --> 00:47:04.68
He's got his mind.

903
00:47:04.68 --> 00:47:05.68
It's just made to do that.

904
00:47:05.68 --> 00:47:10.68
His mind just has a greater understanding of it than a normal person.

905
00:47:10.68 --> 00:47:11.68
Yeah.

906
00:47:11.68 --> 00:47:13.68
And even an abnormal person.

907
00:47:13.68 --> 00:47:14.68
Yeah.

908
00:47:14.68 --> 00:47:15.68
But yeah, that makes sense.

909
00:47:15.68 --> 00:47:19.68
Like, you know, if you're, if you're thorough or thoroughly trained or a lot of experience.

910
00:47:19.68 --> 00:47:24.68
You've been through the pitfalls up to down. You know, you kind of that light is kind of on for you.

911
00:47:24.68 --> 00:47:26.68
But if you just sort of lock out.

912
00:47:26.68 --> 00:47:32.68
Well, yeah. You know, we work with companies who work with like startup companies where it's not that the people haven't

913
00:47:32.68 --> 00:47:34.68
Scrapped to get where they are.

914
00:47:34.68 --> 00:47:39.68
But, you know, you get funded and you got 12 people on your team.

915
00:47:39.68 --> 00:47:44.68
And then all of a sudden you get a massive funding and you're expecting to roll into production or something.

916
00:47:44.68 --> 00:47:47.68
And you look up and you got 180 people.

917
00:47:47.68 --> 00:47:49.68
You don't have any experiences of leader.

918
00:47:49.68 --> 00:47:50.68
Yeah.

919
00:47:50.68 --> 00:47:51.68
And you're expected to lead.

920
00:47:51.68 --> 00:47:56.68
And that's, you know, a situation that echelon front gets involved in because the investors will come and say,

921
00:47:56.68 --> 00:47:59.68
Hey, look, we got these guys over here. They're awesome guys. They're working hard.

922
00:47:59.68 --> 00:48:01.68
Guess what? They got propelled in this position.

923
00:48:01.68 --> 00:48:03.68
They're awesome at their job.

924
00:48:03.68 --> 00:48:05.68
They don't know how to lead yet. Can you help them?

925
00:48:05.68 --> 00:48:06.68
Yes, that's what we do.

926
00:48:06.68 --> 00:48:08.68
Well, and then make it happen.

927
00:48:08.68 --> 00:48:09.68
Makes sense.

928
00:48:09.68 --> 00:48:14.68
Can you can't expect someone to know how to lead if they've never been in a leadership position before?

929
00:48:14.68 --> 00:48:15.68
Yeah.

930
00:48:15.68 --> 00:48:18.68
Can some people pull it off? Yes. It's not a big number, though.

931
00:48:18.68 --> 00:48:21.68
It's not a big number.

932
00:48:21.68 --> 00:48:23.68
Continuing.

933
00:48:23.68 --> 00:48:24.68
Ooh, this is a good one.

934
00:48:24.68 --> 00:48:32.68
He who has not first laid his foundations may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards,

935
00:48:32.68 --> 00:48:39.68
but they will be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building.

936
00:48:39.68 --> 00:48:41.68
So lay a good foundation.

937
00:48:41.68 --> 00:48:44.68
This is another, another thing that's important when it comes to Gitu.

938
00:48:44.68 --> 00:48:47.68
Don't be learning the GoGo Plata day four.

939
00:48:47.68 --> 00:48:49.68
But they're just so fun.

940
00:48:49.68 --> 00:48:50.68
No, no, no.

941
00:48:50.68 --> 00:48:52.68
People want to learn that GoGo Plata.

942
00:48:52.68 --> 00:48:53.68
Yeah.

943
00:48:53.68 --> 00:48:55.68
And they don't know how to do a straight arm lock.

944
00:48:55.68 --> 00:48:56.68
Yeah.

945
00:48:56.68 --> 00:48:57.68
That's a problem.

946
00:48:57.68 --> 00:48:58.68
And that's why though, right?

947
00:48:58.68 --> 00:49:02.68
I mean, even like this, that's why people won't focus on the foundation.

948
00:49:02.68 --> 00:49:06.68
Because that part's not as fun short-term payoff types.

949
00:49:06.68 --> 00:49:07.68
It's a very...

950
00:49:07.68 --> 00:49:08.68
More fun.

951
00:49:08.68 --> 00:49:09.68
It's GoGo Plata is more fun.

952
00:49:09.68 --> 00:49:11.68
Well, look at that. It looks fancy. It looks cool.

953
00:49:11.68 --> 00:49:12.68
Yeah.

954
00:49:12.68 --> 00:49:16.68
I think it was Dean's teaching a class and he was teaching a...

955
00:49:16.68 --> 00:49:18.68
I kind of fall for something like that.

956
00:49:18.68 --> 00:49:20.68
Not for a long time, just a little bit.

957
00:49:20.68 --> 00:49:22.68
And then he was teaching like a position and whatever.

958
00:49:22.68 --> 00:49:24.68
This is actually a while ago.

959
00:49:24.68 --> 00:49:28.68
And then towards the end, he was like, all right, all right, all right.

960
00:49:28.68 --> 00:49:30.68
I'll kind of like, no one said anything like,

961
00:49:30.68 --> 00:49:32.68
Hey, when are we going to learn blah, blah, blah?

962
00:49:32.68 --> 00:49:37.68
He'd no one said anything, but Dean said it as if people were saying,

963
00:49:37.68 --> 00:49:40.68
well, when are we going to learn something fun kind of thing?

964
00:49:40.68 --> 00:49:42.68
Dean was like, all right, I'll teach you a submission.

965
00:49:42.68 --> 00:49:44.68
Kind of like, yeah, you know, because he knew he knows like,

966
00:49:44.68 --> 00:49:46.68
the submission hold is the fun part to learn.

967
00:49:46.68 --> 00:49:48.68
In GJ2. I mean, it's far as a spectrum.

968
00:49:48.68 --> 00:49:50.68
Especially when you start.

969
00:49:50.68 --> 00:49:51.68
Yes.

970
00:49:51.68 --> 00:49:52.68
When you start.

971
00:49:52.68 --> 00:49:53.68
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fully, fully.

972
00:49:53.68 --> 00:49:58.68
Because you just, you know, you think, oh, well, I don't understand why it's good for me to lay this way on some other.

973
00:49:58.68 --> 00:49:58.68
Yeah.

974
00:49:58.68 --> 00:50:00.68
Or just rip across the room.

975
00:50:00.68 --> 00:50:00.68
Who?

976
00:50:00.68 --> 00:50:01.68
Like, what the heck is that?

977
00:50:01.68 --> 00:50:02.68
That's hard.

978
00:50:02.68 --> 00:50:04.68
That's laying a good foundation.

979
00:50:04.68 --> 00:50:05.68
That's what that is.

980
00:50:05.68 --> 00:50:05.68
That's true.

981
00:50:05.68 --> 00:50:08.68
Otherwise, you've got to do it and it's going to be hard to do.

982
00:50:08.68 --> 00:50:11.68
Same thing with businesses when you start a business,

983
00:50:11.68 --> 00:50:13.68
start it with a good foundation.

984
00:50:13.68 --> 00:50:15.68
So you don't have to go back in there afterwards and

985
00:50:15.68 --> 00:50:19.68
perform surgery on something that's already been constructed.

986
00:50:19.68 --> 00:50:20.68
All right.

987
00:50:20.68 --> 00:50:25.68
Now, this is Macy Evelian in a pretty serious way.

988
00:50:25.68 --> 00:50:28.68
The name of this one is called, or this is, I would say,

989
00:50:28.68 --> 00:50:30.68
this is kind of what stems some of the reputation.

990
00:50:30.68 --> 00:50:35.68
Concerning those who have obtained a principality by wickedness.

991
00:50:35.68 --> 00:50:43.68
And I said this establishes, but this actually goes against sort of that standard

992
00:50:43.68 --> 00:50:48.68
Macy Evelian attitude.

993
00:50:48.68 --> 00:50:50.68
So here we go.

994
00:50:50.68 --> 00:50:56.68
This is one of the historical examples that he gives that I'm actually going to read

995
00:50:56.68 --> 00:50:59.68
because it's pretty, pretty cool.

996
00:50:59.68 --> 00:51:05.68
A gathachlise, the Sicilian became king of Syracuse, not only from a private,

997
00:51:05.68 --> 00:51:09.68
but from a low and abject position.

998
00:51:09.68 --> 00:51:13.68
This man, the son of a potter, through all the changes in his fortunes,

999
00:51:13.68 --> 00:51:15.68
always led an infamous life.

1000
00:51:15.68 --> 00:51:20.68
Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of mind and body,

1001
00:51:20.68 --> 00:51:24.68
having devoted himself to the military profession.

1002
00:51:24.68 --> 00:51:28.68
He rose through the, it's ranks to be Prater of Syracuse.

1003
00:51:28.68 --> 00:51:32.68
Being established in that position and having deliberately resolved to make

1004
00:51:32.68 --> 00:51:37.68
himself Prince and to seize by violence without obligation to others,

1005
00:51:37.68 --> 00:51:40.68
that which had been considered to him by a scent,

1006
00:51:40.68 --> 00:51:45.68
he came to an understanding for this purpose with the, with amacar,

1007
00:51:45.68 --> 00:51:51.68
the carthineogen, who, with his army, was fighting in Sicily.

1008
00:51:51.68 --> 00:51:55.68
One morning, he assembled the people and the Senate of Syracuse.

1009
00:51:55.68 --> 00:51:59.68
As if he had to discuss with them things relating to the Republic.

1010
00:51:59.68 --> 00:52:05.68
And at a given signal, the soldiers killed all the senators and the richest of the people.

1011
00:52:05.68 --> 00:52:11.68
These dead, he seized and held the princentum of that city without any civil

1012
00:52:11.68 --> 00:52:12.68
commotion.

1013
00:52:12.68 --> 00:52:15.68
And although he was twice routed by the carthaginians, he ultimately,

1014
00:52:15.68 --> 00:52:20.68
and ultimately besieged, yet not only was he able to defend his city,

1015
00:52:20.68 --> 00:52:23.68
but leaving part of his man for its defense,

1016
00:52:23.68 --> 00:52:29.68
with others he attacked Africa and in a short time raised the siege of Syracuse.

1017
00:52:29.68 --> 00:52:31.68
The carthaginians reduced to extreme necessity,

1018
00:52:31.68 --> 00:52:36.68
were compelled to come to terms with a goffacleys and leaving Sicily

1019
00:52:36.68 --> 00:52:42.68
to him had to be content with the possession of Africa.

1020
00:52:42.68 --> 00:52:49.68
So this guy is just gets after it and destroys people and kills people

1021
00:52:49.68 --> 00:52:52.68
in order to get into a good position.

1022
00:52:52.68 --> 00:52:56.68
You might think that McEvelli would say, hey, that's great.

1023
00:52:56.68 --> 00:52:58.68
Here's what he actually says back to the book.

1024
00:52:58.68 --> 00:53:02.68
Yet it cannot be called talent to slay fellow citizens,

1025
00:53:02.68 --> 00:53:06.68
to deceive friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion,

1026
00:53:06.68 --> 00:53:11.68
such methods may gain empire, but not glory.

1027
00:53:11.68 --> 00:53:15.68
Still, if the courage of a gothiclies in entering into the end,

1028
00:53:15.68 --> 00:53:18.68
and extricating himself from the dangers be considered,

1029
00:53:18.68 --> 00:53:22.68
together with his greatness of mind and enduring and overcoming hardships,

1030
00:53:22.68 --> 00:53:27.68
it cannot be seen why he should be less esteemed than the most notable captain.

1031
00:53:27.68 --> 00:53:30.68
Oh, that he is. Give it a little credit.

1032
00:53:30.68 --> 00:53:35.68
But then he goes back again, never the less has barberus cruelty and inhumanity

1033
00:53:35.68 --> 00:53:40.68
with infinite wickedness, do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men,

1034
00:53:40.68 --> 00:53:47.68
what he had achieved, what he achieved cannot be attributed to either fortune or genius.

1035
00:53:47.68 --> 00:53:53.68
So, and I'll go one step further, because this is what I think.

1036
00:53:53.68 --> 00:53:58.68
I think that when you behave in that manner, it'll come back to you.

1037
00:53:58.68 --> 00:54:01.68
It'll come back to you, and I'm not saying it's going to come back to you

1038
00:54:01.68 --> 00:54:04.68
to the carmic way, dude. That's not what I'm saying.

1039
00:54:04.68 --> 00:54:09.68
I'm saying when you inflict damage on people, they remember it.

1040
00:54:09.68 --> 00:54:14.68
And there will be a time, in some point, when they will have the opportunity

1041
00:54:14.68 --> 00:54:21.68
to rain down vengeance upon you. So, if you act that way, you're going to get yours.

1042
00:54:21.68 --> 00:54:27.68
And so, if you treat people with respect and you treat people as you would like to be treated,

1043
00:54:27.68 --> 00:54:32.68
then it's fine. And when the opportunity arises for them to cross you, they'll remember how you treated them

1044
00:54:32.68 --> 00:54:35.68
and you treat them well and they say, okay, you know what, we're going to give this guy a pass.

1045
00:54:35.68 --> 00:54:40.68
When you screw people over, they're going to screw you back at some point.

1046
00:54:40.68 --> 00:54:43.68
Yeah.

1047
00:54:43.68 --> 00:54:49.68
Continuing on, it has to be remarked that in seizing a state, the use surper ought to examine

1048
00:54:49.68 --> 00:54:55.68
closely all those injuries which it is necessary for him to inflict and do them all at one stroke.

1049
00:54:55.68 --> 00:55:01.68
So, as to not have to repeat them daily and thus by not unsettling men, he will be able to reassure

1050
00:55:01.68 --> 00:55:07.68
them and win them to himself by benefits. This is a good one.

1051
00:55:07.68 --> 00:55:12.68
If you've got to cause damage, rip the band it off. That's what he said.

1052
00:55:12.68 --> 00:55:17.68
So, if you're going into a business and you're like, okay, we're going to have to eliminate some people.

1053
00:55:17.68 --> 00:55:24.68
Don't eliminate two guys today and then two guys in a week and then three days, three guys in a month and three people in two weeks.

1054
00:55:24.68 --> 00:55:29.68
And you just, everyone now everyone's walking around their scared of getting destroyed. They're scared of getting fired.

1055
00:55:29.68 --> 00:55:33.68
They don't trust you. You go and you go, okay, hey, here's sorry.

1056
00:55:33.68 --> 00:55:37.68
Hey, there's some changes. There's some reductions we've got to make. Here it is. There's 28 people.

1057
00:55:37.68 --> 00:55:40.68
They're going away. What's left? We're going to go forward.

1058
00:55:40.68 --> 00:55:55.68
We're going to conquer. He who does otherwise either from timidity or evil advice is always compelled to keep the knife in his hand.

1059
00:55:55.68 --> 00:56:04.68
Neither can he rely on his subjects nor can they attach themselves to him owing to their continued and repeated wrongs.

1060
00:56:04.68 --> 00:56:19.68
So you keep stabbing people. Everyone's in a while, every two or three days. I cut someone's head off. These guys are just, you know, first of all, I got to walk around with a knife all the time and they're thinking, oh, I see what he's all about.

1061
00:56:19.68 --> 00:56:33.68
Continuing for injuries ought to be done all at one time so that being tasted less. They offend less benefits ought to be given little by little so that the flavors of them may last longer.

1062
00:56:33.68 --> 00:56:46.68
So you don't go and give everyone a yearly bonus at the beginning of the year. Hey, here's all this money. There you go. Hey, look is good, quarter or good month last month. Got to some point.

1063
00:56:46.68 --> 00:56:49.68
That tastes less long.

1064
00:56:49.68 --> 00:56:52.68
Yes, it does.

1065
00:56:52.68 --> 00:56:54.68
I recommend that with children, by the way.

1066
00:56:54.68 --> 00:56:59.68
Okay. You know what I'm saying? Yes. You don't give them the big reward. You make them. You got to earn it.

1067
00:56:59.68 --> 00:57:03.68
Yeah, to get to earn it. Yeah. Keep it going. Keep it going.

1068
00:57:03.68 --> 00:57:18.68
Continuing and above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such a way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil shall make him change.

1069
00:57:18.68 --> 00:57:39.68
Because if the necessity for this comes in trouble times, you are too late for harsh measures and mild ones will not help you for they will be considered as forced from you and no one will be under any obligation to you for them. So what are you saying? There's stay balanced.

1070
00:57:39.68 --> 00:57:45.68
So if you if things are going well in your company and you're like, hey, bonus is all around.

1071
00:57:45.68 --> 00:57:50.68
And then all of a sudden things get lean and you're like, no more bonuses.

1072
00:57:50.68 --> 00:57:53.68
Or the other hand is like, oh, things are going rough.

1073
00:57:53.68 --> 00:58:01.68
Like, we're not giving anyone anything. What you need to do is stay balanced. Hey, here's the budget. Here's our projected budget. Here's what we're going to give out. Here's what we're planning to give out.

1074
00:58:01.68 --> 00:58:10.68
It may vary a little bit on, you know, upper down from there depending on the market, depending on how we're doing, depending on what the future like you want to be balanced.

1075
00:58:10.68 --> 00:58:21.68
Don't go hardcore and want extreme or the other. Next.

1076
00:58:21.68 --> 00:58:34.68
Where a leading citizen becomes the prince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence, but by the favor of his fellow citizens, this may be called a civil principality.

1077
00:58:34.68 --> 00:58:50.68
Nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain it, but rather a happy shrewdness. And this seems to be the most positive thing that he, this happy shrewdness. Like, oh, you're making good decision, shrewd decisions. And that's how you come into power and people are happy with it.

1078
00:58:50.68 --> 00:59:01.68
Like that seems like the best possible way to take over according to this, continuing one cannot by fair dealing.

1079
00:59:01.68 --> 00:59:14.68
And without injury to others satisfy the nobles, but if you can satisfy the people for their object is more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress and the former only desire not to be oppressed.

1080
00:59:14.68 --> 00:59:20.68
So who's more important? The nobles or the people? The people? That's not very mac-evalient.

1081
00:59:20.68 --> 00:59:26.68
Or it's not the tradition, mac-evalient consideration.

1082
00:59:26.68 --> 00:59:38.68
It is to be added also that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people, because of their being too many, whilst from nobles he can secure himself as they are few and number.

1083
00:59:38.68 --> 01:00:03.68
Hmm, make a connection with your people, continuing. The worst that a prince may expect from a hostile people is to be abandoned by them. But from hostile nobles, he is not only to fair abandonment, but also that they will rise against him for they being in these affairs more farceing in a suit, always come forward in a time to save themselves and to obtain favors from him whom they expect to prevail.

1084
01:00:03.68 --> 01:00:09.68
And he goes on about these nobles a little bit more. Nobles ought to be looked at mainly in two ways.

1085
01:00:09.68 --> 01:00:19.68
They either shape their course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune or they don't. So there's two different kinds of people you'll have with you.

1086
01:00:19.68 --> 01:00:26.68
People that just get on board or don't. They get on board or they don't.

1087
01:00:26.68 --> 01:00:34.68
And then he says when for their own ambitious ends, they shun binding themselves.

1088
01:00:34.68 --> 01:00:46.68
It is a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you and a prince ought to guard against such and to fear them as if they were open enemies.

1089
01:00:46.68 --> 01:00:57.68
Because in adversity, they will always help to ruin you.

1090
01:00:57.68 --> 01:01:05.68
Someone that's not on board, someone that's looking out for themselves. Someone that's looking out for themselves and not looking out for you.

1091
01:01:05.68 --> 01:01:15.68
It's a problem, real problem. You treat them like an open enemy or view them, fear them as if they're an open enemy.

1092
01:01:15.68 --> 01:01:26.68
And then he continues, but one who in opposition to the people becomes a prince by the favor of nobles ought above everything seek to win the people over to himself.

1093
01:01:26.68 --> 01:01:31.68
And this he may easily do if he takes them under his protection.

1094
01:01:31.68 --> 01:01:40.68
Because men, when they receive good from him, of whom they were expecting evil, are more bound or bound more closely than to their benefactor.

1095
01:01:40.68 --> 01:01:49.68
And then he goes, they'll do this.

1096
01:01:49.68 --> 01:01:55.68
And if they think they are going to treat them like crap and then you treat them well, they're like doubly devoted to you.

1097
01:01:55.68 --> 01:02:13.68
And then you can explain that to you with comfort. Like you know, if you're in bed and then you hear, I don't know, chicken outside or something or like a black hole air or something.

1098
01:02:13.68 --> 01:02:26.68
And then you can't relax with that noise or whatever, because you expect to be real comfortable in your bed, kind of think, but you go land some chair or sit on a chair and it's surprisingly comfortable.

1099
01:02:26.68 --> 01:02:28.68
You fall asleep real quick.

1100
01:02:28.68 --> 01:02:34.68
So it's got the same deal with the people though, you may be really in Napstone.

1101
01:02:34.68 --> 01:02:48.68
And then you can even just on a normal social level, you know, when you're all he's going to be doing, you meet them up like a movie stars right?

1102
01:02:48.68 --> 01:02:53.68
Let's say they always play a bad guy or something like that. And this goes both ways too.

1103
01:02:53.68 --> 01:02:56.68
And you meet the movie star in person and they're all nice.

1104
01:02:56.68 --> 01:03:01.68
But you're using them playing the bad guy. So you have this weird subconscious expectation that you just love that guy.

1105
01:03:01.68 --> 01:03:05.68
Whatever they play there, that's how they are. Yeah, it's like subconscious what.

1106
01:03:05.68 --> 01:03:13.68
Do you think that those people that play a bad guy all the time when in real life they feel like everyone views me like I'm a jerk. So I'm going to be super nice.

1107
01:03:13.68 --> 01:03:15.68
Maybe.

1108
01:03:15.68 --> 01:03:25.68
But actually, you know what, I actually hear more about the opposite where it's like, it's the good guy. You know, he's all he's playing the good guy or maybe on some show or something like that.

1109
01:03:25.68 --> 01:03:34.68
Guys, you know, you meet him in real life. He's not like that. Anyway, same deal. Yeah, expectations mean a lot is what you're getting at.

1110
01:03:34.68 --> 01:03:38.68
You know, including leadership perspective and napping perspective.

1111
01:03:38.68 --> 01:03:38.68
Yes.

1112
01:03:38.68 --> 01:03:41.68
And meeting stars or whatever. Yes.

1113
01:03:41.68 --> 01:03:42.68
There we go.

1114
01:03:42.68 --> 01:03:54.68
A prince who can command and is a man of courage undismayed an advert in adversity who does not fail in other qualifications and who by his resolution and energy.

1115
01:03:54.68 --> 01:04:07.68
Keeps the whole people encouraged such a one will never find himself deceived in them and it will be shown that he has laid his foundations well.

1116
01:04:07.68 --> 01:04:11.68
Again, this is not what people think.

1117
01:04:11.68 --> 01:04:14.68
Mackey, Mackey, Veli, what's talking about?

1118
01:04:14.68 --> 01:04:18.68
No, they think he's saying build relationship be strong.

1119
01:04:18.68 --> 01:04:20.68
Give to your people.

1120
01:04:20.68 --> 01:04:36.68
Continuing a wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state and of him and then he will always find them faithful.

1121
01:04:36.68 --> 01:04:40.68
Well, that one's a little bit. That one's a little bit. Hey, you know, you need me here.

1122
01:04:40.68 --> 01:04:41.68
Yeah.

1123
01:04:41.68 --> 01:04:44.68
That one's a little bit mackey velentradish.

1124
01:04:44.68 --> 01:05:02.68
Yeah. Continuing, whoever shall fortify his town and shall have managed the other concerns of his subjects well and to be often repeated will never be attacked without great caution.

1125
01:05:02.68 --> 01:05:13.68
For men are always adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen and it will be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town well fortified and is not hated by his people.

1126
01:05:13.68 --> 01:05:18.68
Again, try and build relationship with your people.

1127
01:05:18.68 --> 01:05:21.68
That's what he's saying.

1128
01:05:21.68 --> 01:05:33.68
A prince who has a strong city and has not made himself odious will not be attacked or if anyone sure to attack you will only be driven off with disgrace.

1129
01:05:33.68 --> 01:05:34.68
Same thing.

1130
01:05:34.68 --> 01:05:45.68
Like if you've got a good if your people support you, you can get attacked and you're going to drive that person off that attack you drive them off into disgrace.

1131
01:05:45.68 --> 01:05:53.68
Quick one here that the arms with which a prince defends his state are either his own or there are mercenaries,

1132
01:05:53.68 --> 01:06:07.68
or mixed and we says our exilaries, he's talking about how if you have an ally you can use their troops right so if you and I are allies and I'm like, hey, I'm going to be an attacker here, you can send me some troops. Those are my exilary troops.

1133
01:06:07.68 --> 01:06:22.68
mercenaries and exilaries are useless and dangerous and if one holds his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe for they are disunited ambushes and vicious and without discipline unfaithful,

1134
01:06:22.68 --> 01:06:41.68
walking it before friends cowardly before enemies. They have neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men and destruction is deferred only so long as the attack is. For him peace, one is robbed by them and in war by the enemy.

1135
01:06:41.68 --> 01:06:46.48
the field, then a trifle of a stipend which is not sufficient to make them willing to die

1136
01:06:46.48 --> 01:06:53.92
for you. They are already enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war

1137
01:06:53.92 --> 01:07:04.64
comes, they take themselves off or run from the foe. I've got a friend that does high level

1138
01:07:04.64 --> 01:07:14.64
security and they were going through like a high level briefing plan if in like a serious

1139
01:07:14.64 --> 01:07:23.52
disaster scenario with a high paying client and he was basically had incorporated into the

1140
01:07:23.52 --> 01:07:31.84
plan his own family. So okay, echo the high playing client, you come to me and say hey I want if there's a

1141
01:07:31.84 --> 01:07:42.08
if there's a complete catastrophe. We're talking campio break out zombie apocalypse. What's the plan?

1142
01:07:42.08 --> 01:07:46.80
And he goes, okay, here's the plan. He came up with a plan and he put, I said okay echo, here's the plan,

1143
01:07:46.80 --> 01:07:50.32
here's what's going to happen. Here's where my family is going to be. And the guy's like what do you

1144
01:07:50.32 --> 01:07:54.24
mean? You're like, well, you're family. I'm not worried about your family. The security guy's

1145
01:07:54.24 --> 01:07:58.88
is the security guy's like, hey, I'm not, you guys, you guys, you guys, I will be bringing my family.

1146
01:07:58.88 --> 01:08:03.04
And the guy's like, wait, why are you bringing your family? He says, because if I'm not bringing my

1147
01:08:03.04 --> 01:08:10.32
family, I'm not going to be there to help you survive. And the guy says, okay, fair enough. Right?

1148
01:08:10.32 --> 01:08:14.72
Yes. Hey, we've got a bunker to go to. I'll get you to the bunker, but I'm not going to get,

1149
01:08:14.72 --> 01:08:19.36
I'm not going to leave my family. And then you think I'm going to defend your bunker when my

1150
01:08:19.36 --> 01:08:25.44
family is out with the zombies? No. The best thing you could possibly do is let me bring my family

1151
01:08:25.44 --> 01:08:30.72
in the bunker, because then I will die before I give up the bunker. If it's just you, I love you.

1152
01:08:30.72 --> 01:08:34.72
I appreciate you're giving me money, but I'm going to take care of my family first. Yeah.

1153
01:08:34.72 --> 01:08:39.52
So think about that. It's a square-to-way plan, right? Yeah. You actually embed yourself inside

1154
01:08:39.52 --> 01:08:44.40
my family and you're going to be safe. Yeah. I'll use some of your money to prepare for the situation,

1155
01:08:45.12 --> 01:08:51.92
but then we'll be ready. Yeah. We're all one team now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that turned someone

1156
01:08:51.92 --> 01:08:59.60
from a mercenary into, you know, part of the team. Yeah. Yeah. Continuing on, the mercenary

1157
01:08:59.60 --> 01:09:05.76
captains are either capable men or they are not. If they are, you cannot trust them because they

1158
01:09:05.76 --> 01:09:12.32
always aspire to their own greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master or others

1159
01:09:12.32 --> 01:09:18.24
contrary to your intentions. But if the captain is not skillful, you are ruined the usual way.

1160
01:09:18.24 --> 01:09:24.72
Yeah. Yeah. Just the usual way of being ruined. You know what that is? That means you just

1161
01:09:24.72 --> 01:09:28.56
get hacked to death on the battlefield. That's what it means. Luz Luz with the mercenary. Yeah.

1162
01:09:28.56 --> 01:09:35.76
The mercenary is a Luz Luz scenario. Yeah. Continuing. A Prince ought to have no, uh,

1163
01:09:37.12 --> 01:09:43.52
it's getting his own for this one. A Prince ought to have no other aim or thought,

1164
01:09:43.52 --> 01:09:49.76
nor select anything else for his study, then war and its rules and discipline.

1165
01:09:51.52 --> 01:09:59.92
For this is the soul art that belongs to him who rules and it is of such force that it not only

1166
01:09:59.92 --> 01:10:07.20
upholds those who are born princes, but it often enables men to rise from a private station to that

1167
01:10:07.20 --> 01:10:17.28
rank. And on the contrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease, then of arms,

1168
01:10:17.28 --> 01:10:25.44
they have lost their states. And the first cause of your Luzing it is to neglect this art.

1169
01:10:27.20 --> 01:10:32.48
And what enables you to acquire a state is to be the master of the art.

1170
01:10:32.48 --> 01:10:40.08
So there you go. That's general rules for everyone. Study nothing but war.

1171
01:10:40.64 --> 01:10:48.64
And yes. Cool. Yeah. Yes. It is interesting, isn't it?

1172
01:10:51.12 --> 01:10:57.84
I mean, you don't have to go back that far to where the way things are going to be is settled by

1173
01:10:57.84 --> 01:11:01.76
war. 100% and you can still say that's true today. I mean, we're in a poem of sea fails. We've got a war.

1174
01:11:01.76 --> 01:11:06.24
Yeah. That's the way it works. You and I can't have a conversation. If that conversation fails,

1175
01:11:06.24 --> 01:11:12.72
what's going to happen? Agreed, it is a degree. From not agreeing to that, turns into a scrap.

1176
01:11:13.60 --> 01:11:20.88
So I better study. Yeah. Now, if one of us knows that the other one is going to win on the field of

1177
01:11:20.88 --> 01:11:25.84
battle, that's going to make that person a little bit more apt to agree, right? Yes. You know what I mean?

1178
01:11:25.84 --> 01:11:32.88
Yeah. Or agreed to disagree whichever. No, well, the one person might have to agree. All the

1179
01:11:32.88 --> 01:11:43.12
ways they're getting choked. All right. So now he talks about how you continue on.

1180
01:11:44.32 --> 01:11:50.24
A Prince who does not understand the art of war over and above the other misfortunes already mentioned

1181
01:11:50.24 --> 01:11:57.76
cannot be respected by his soldiers. Nor can he rely on them. He ought never, therefore, to have his

1182
01:11:57.76 --> 01:12:04.80
thoughts, this to have out of his thoughts, this subject of war. And in peace, he should

1183
01:12:04.80 --> 01:12:13.20
adict himself more to its exercise than in war. This he can do in two ways, the one by actually

1184
01:12:13.20 --> 01:12:20.64
you know, by study. So he's saying that in peace time, you can actually adict yourself more to exercising

1185
01:12:20.64 --> 01:12:26.16
war than you can and war itself. So when it's time to prepare, you prepare. Even when it's

1186
01:12:26.16 --> 01:12:30.80
well, not war going on, that's when you get ready. You don't wait until you're getting attacked

1187
01:12:30.80 --> 01:12:35.84
to start training jiu-jitsu. You start now. Yeah. I've had that argument with people. I said,

1188
01:12:35.84 --> 01:12:40.80
well, the thing is, takes really long time to get good at jiu-jitsu. Why are you going to be attacked?

1189
01:12:40.80 --> 01:12:45.76
Well, I don't know. If you get attacked tomorrow, that's a bummer. But you're probably not going

1190
01:12:45.76 --> 01:12:49.20
to get attacked tomorrow. You're going to attack in six months. You might get attacked in a year.

1191
01:12:49.20 --> 01:12:52.64
You might get attacked in four years. You can be really good by that time.

1192
01:12:54.16 --> 01:12:59.60
Yeah. Yeah, there was an article. I think you even came across it. You might even comment it

1193
01:12:59.60 --> 01:13:07.04
on it online. And in the article, it was like some things that you shouldn't focus on or whatever

1194
01:13:07.04 --> 01:13:13.60
is a man or something like this. And I thought it was a fake article and so I still think,

1195
01:13:13.60 --> 01:13:17.12
I mean, I don't know if it was really or not. But whatever. Let's just say it was real.

1196
01:13:17.84 --> 01:13:22.64
And it was like fighting. It's at fighting. That's the most wrong thing ever. Yeah. And I actually

1197
01:13:22.64 --> 01:13:27.76
agree that I actually think that this is so high up. I kind of agree that this with this statement,

1198
01:13:27.76 --> 01:13:32.64
like you should focus on this. This is being really high in your focus in life. Yeah. And it

1199
01:13:32.64 --> 01:13:38.32
really comes down to a safety thing. Really. And look, yeah, definitely comes down to a safety thing.

1200
01:13:38.32 --> 01:13:44.80
I'm not I'm not saying like, hey, just study jiu-jitsu, just study MMA. I'm not saying that, right?

1201
01:13:44.80 --> 01:13:48.32
Because those shouldn't be your primary interest unless you're a fighter, right? And there's

1202
01:13:48.32 --> 01:13:52.56
some people that are so into whatever. They get so into jiu-jitsu that the rest of their life

1203
01:13:52.56 --> 01:13:58.000
falls apart. Not recommending that, right? You want you to have a good well balanced life. But if you

1204
01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:03.44
make jiu-jitsu, a part of it, it's going to be better. It's going to be better. It's going to adapt

1205
01:14:03.44 --> 01:14:08.56
to everything else. It's going to teach you about other things. Yeah. And that's not to mention you

1206
01:14:08.56 --> 01:14:13.68
can fight if you are. And not to mention Peter or Tia. He's like, he mentioned something about

1207
01:14:14.72 --> 01:14:18.72
what was it? It was something to do with golf. Like basically he was saying,

1208
01:14:18.72 --> 01:14:23.28
you have to put all this effort in and it's too frustrating. And I said, wait,

1209
01:14:23.28 --> 01:14:27.92
he tried jiu-jitsu. Yeah. And then someone else said, and he said, that's why I'm not doing it.

1210
01:14:27.92 --> 01:14:32.16
Or something like that. Or he said something when it was on it. And then I said something like,

1211
01:14:33.44 --> 01:14:38.88
oh, no, someone else chimed in, hey, golf doesn't teach you anything. Like golf has what

1212
01:14:38.88 --> 01:14:44.40
transferable skills to life does golf have. Yeah. Hey, I'm not hating on golf. If you let golf

1213
01:14:44.40 --> 01:14:51.92
cool, more power to you as far as I'm concerned. But you're not going to be able to take the skills

1214
01:14:51.92 --> 01:14:57.76
of a pot and bring them to. Now, okay, well, let's, let's reach here. I guess you will,

1215
01:14:57.76 --> 01:15:00.32
because you know, you're going to be able to relax, you're going to learn how to get mental

1216
01:15:00.32 --> 01:15:06.000
focus. So that's good. Good in that perspective. We'll give credit. But direct transferable,

1217
01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:13.28
physical techniques, very limited. Limited, especially when you start comparing them to jiu-jitsu.

1218
01:15:13.28 --> 01:15:17.28
Yeah. Because golf can give you some of the same things that that like when I talk about

1219
01:15:17.28 --> 01:15:20.64
shooting, like when you get good at shooting, it gives golf can give you some of those same things

1220
01:15:20.64 --> 01:15:24.32
because you're under pressure. You got to focus. You got to put the last shot out of your mind.

1221
01:15:24.32 --> 01:15:27.36
You got to focus on what you're actually doing. You can't worry about the next shock. There's

1222
01:15:27.36 --> 01:15:31.36
a lot of things that it can help there. Yeah. There's some motor skills stuff in there. There's

1223
01:15:31.36 --> 01:15:36.96
a lot of stuff in there. Yeah. But I cut you off for a reason. What was I saying?

1224
01:15:36.96 --> 01:15:41.44
But I don't know if I was super hyped on whatever I was about to say. Oh, they article the

1225
01:15:41.44 --> 01:15:45.84
way. Oh, yeah. So it was like fighting. You shouldn't, you know, fight or whatever. And what

1226
01:15:45.84 --> 01:15:51.20
made it even worse, like a lot worse, is the explanation as to why? What was the reason why? So

1227
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:56.96
if I remember correctly, it was because you shouldn't be fighting. That's why. It's like,

1228
01:15:56.96 --> 01:16:00.96
yeah, you only fight if you lose your temper. You know, like you know, you shouldn't. It's

1229
01:16:00.96 --> 01:16:05.76
been in a nutshell. You say, because you shouldn't be fighting. So you shouldn't focus on learning

1230
01:16:05.76 --> 01:16:11.68
how to fight or whatever. Here's the ultimate dichotomy in this situation. The more the

1231
01:16:11.68 --> 01:16:16.24
better you can fight, the less you're going to have to fight exactly right. And most of us,

1232
01:16:16.24 --> 01:16:22.56
in fact, out, I would, I'm almost tempted to say it. All of us, everybody who is a train fighter

1233
01:16:22.56 --> 01:16:27.44
unless you're talking about competition, you don't train to fight so you can go get into fights

1234
01:16:27.44 --> 01:16:34.40
with me. No. That's not the reason. Not even like a little bit of the reason. Okay. I can't think

1235
01:16:34.40 --> 01:16:42.16
of anyone that I've known in training, Gigiitsu that their goal is like, hey, I'm doing this. So I can

1236
01:16:42.16 --> 01:16:49.20
go antagonize people and actually get into, get myself into fights. There's no one that you're right.

1237
01:16:49.20 --> 01:16:55.20
There's no one that's you. I mean, I'm sure there's a couple complete jerks somewhere out there

1238
01:16:55.20 --> 01:16:58.96
that have done that, but like I haven't known any. Yeah. And even thinking about that, it'd be like

1239
01:16:58.96 --> 01:17:03.84
it's that that would be weird. Yeah. You'd see like a like a different one someone's like a bouncer, right? Oh,

1240
01:17:03.84 --> 01:17:08.48
you were a bouncer, right? And it's like, oh, I want to know how to handle myself if I get into a fight,

1241
01:17:09.12 --> 01:17:17.60
but you'd rather just be polite to people until it was, be polite, right? Until it's being nice until

1242
01:17:17.60 --> 01:17:21.44
it's time to not be nice. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. That's the way we used to do it, right?

1243
01:17:21.44 --> 01:17:29.60
There. Exactly. Right. But even then, even then, by no means, it's literally the opposite direction.

1244
01:17:29.60 --> 01:17:35.76
It's not so I know how to go fight guys. You know, it's more so you know what to do in the event

1245
01:17:35.76 --> 01:17:42.16
of a fight. Now I will say this. I have to look at this from perspective when I was younger,

1246
01:17:42.88 --> 01:17:49.52
like before I joined the military, there's times where we were getting in fights just to get into fights.

1247
01:17:49.52 --> 01:17:55.84
Yeah. And if Jitu would have been a thing, I probably would have been doing it.

1248
01:17:57.92 --> 01:18:02.64
I was just young and stupid, so all my friends. All right. So here's kind of the,

1249
01:18:02.64 --> 01:18:07.92
what I call it a dichotomy, but I think it's more like a sure I'll call it a dichot. It's like a

1250
01:18:07.92 --> 01:18:13.60
catch 22. So like when you don't know how to fight, like before you take Jitu, oh yeah, I'm

1251
01:18:13.60 --> 01:18:19.04
the same boat, where it's like getting in a fight seems more appealing. When you learn Jitu and

1252
01:18:19.04 --> 01:18:23.12
here's the proof by the way, when you learn Jitu, you don't really want to do it. Maybe at first,

1253
01:18:23.12 --> 01:18:27.92
maybe at first your white belt or whatever, sure. But think about this blue belt, purple belt,

1254
01:18:27.92 --> 01:18:33.28
brown belt, and this goes up and up the the more you advanced. Okay, your black belt. You've been

1255
01:18:33.28 --> 01:18:39.60
a black belt for like what 13, 14 years or something like this. One, a brand new white belt comes in.

1256
01:18:39.60 --> 01:18:45.52
Do you want to roll with him or you want to roll with Andy? Andy. Why? Andy's good. Exactly right.

1257
01:18:45.52 --> 01:18:51.76
So you want, you don't want to go test your skills again. Some weirdo on the street, you know,

1258
01:18:51.76 --> 01:18:57.36
you want to go practice and learn and improve that you're like good with other good people,

1259
01:18:57.36 --> 01:19:02.56
you know, other people who are trained. So it's like it makes no sense. Well, then I thought what

1260
01:19:02.56 --> 01:19:08.000
we were going like that is when you're good or no, like let's say you're an almond gold or

1261
01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:12.08
not a fight. The your first Jitu class, you're like, okay, I'm not going to get any fights. You

1262
01:19:12.08 --> 01:19:15.28
know what I'm saying? Like that's where I thought you're going, which is I think a very realistic

1263
01:19:15.28 --> 01:19:21.52
thing. And I think if I was 15 years old again and Jitu exists, and I was like, oh, I'm going to

1264
01:19:21.52 --> 01:19:25.20
go learn not a fight. I would have gone in there one class, and I'd be like, I'm not getting any fights.

1265
01:19:25.20 --> 01:19:28.40
Oh, I've heard of this stuff because you never know who knows this stuff. Because you go in a

1266
01:19:28.40 --> 01:19:32.72
Jitu class and you get choked out by someone that is half years or maybe three quarters your size.

1267
01:19:33.52 --> 01:19:37.68
Yeah. That's a scary thing. Very scary. You saw some sort of looking around going away. Who knows

1268
01:19:37.68 --> 01:19:42.64
that? Yeah. I'm not your confidence goes way down when you, well, I'm not your career.

1269
01:19:43.76 --> 01:19:48.000
Yeah, that's your thing that you're talking about. It's yeah, it's absolutely true. And I was in the

1270
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.24
oh man, I felt that it was overwhelmed because I was in the like, like you said, I was a bouncer.

1271
01:19:53.04 --> 01:19:58.32
So even when you get your blue belt, it's like that's when you're kind of the most fiery, I think,

1272
01:19:58.32 --> 01:20:03.04
in certain ways. Um, yeah. And so I'm looking around and I'm like, yeah, you know, I could do this.

1273
01:20:03.04 --> 01:20:06.88
But you know, I could take that guy. He's bigger, but I could take him like, I know I can, but then you're

1274
01:20:06.88 --> 01:20:11.28
like, wait, no, I don't know who that guy is. You know, you can see one wrestler.

1275
01:20:11.28 --> 01:20:19.20
But what if you caught yourself in a real fight? You're, you're kind of done, man.

1276
01:20:19.20 --> 01:20:24.48
You've been big. You've been big. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of. Yeah. So when you think about that,

1277
01:20:24.48 --> 01:20:28.000
you're like, man, yeah, just like what you said, but I'm not getting into any fights. There is that.

1278
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.72
So this goes even further. So this article that you're talking about that said, you shouldn't

1279
01:20:32.72 --> 01:20:36.96
learn how to fight because you shouldn't be fighting. Yeah. I shouldn't get into fight. The actual,

1280
01:20:36.96 --> 01:20:41.20
if you feel the urge to fight the best thing you can do to quail that urge to go learn how to fight.

1281
01:20:41.20 --> 01:20:48.24
Yeah. I think he said the best thing is to go learn meditation. No. Yeah. Sam Harris, where you at?

1282
01:20:48.24 --> 01:20:52.72
We're not as not going to help us. I'm not against meditation. But as a as a replacement for

1283
01:20:52.72 --> 01:21:00.32
laying out a fight. No. Sorry, man. And you know what? I've had Tim Ferris and Peter and I don't know

1284
01:21:00.32 --> 01:21:07.60
if we talk about this with Sam yet that they think they, they, they impose meditation on

1285
01:21:07.60 --> 01:21:12.88
to my duty to form it. Right? They're like, that is, they're like, hey, Joc, the things that people

1286
01:21:12.88 --> 01:21:18.96
are trying to get from meditation is what you get when you go and you do duty to. Like your

1287
01:21:18.96 --> 01:21:25.36
mind gets emptied your focused, but not focused. There's all these things. And I'm sure I'm, you know,

1288
01:21:25.36 --> 01:21:29.12
people that are in the meditation will say, no, you're missing it. I'm fine. That's fine. I know I am.

1289
01:21:29.12 --> 01:21:35.04
Whatever. But what I'm saying is there are some similarities between their hashtory because

1290
01:21:35.04 --> 01:21:41.60
Tim and Sam, you know, they both duty to do duty to and do meditation. And there's cross over there.

1291
01:21:41.60 --> 01:21:46.000
Somewhere. Tim for sure has told me that. Tim for sure has told me that he's even like weight

1292
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.76
lifting. You know, even when you're trying to do a movement, right? You're trying to do a snatch.

1293
01:21:51.76 --> 01:21:56.88
You're trying to do some movement that you have to focus on. That puts you, I mean, you know,

1294
01:21:56.88 --> 01:22:02.08
it's like when you go to duty to you come home, you feel so good. But you don't feel good because of

1295
01:22:02.08 --> 01:22:06.56
the physical work out. You feel good because your brain got emptied. Yeah. You know, and I think that's

1296
01:22:06.56 --> 01:22:15.52
part of what meditation is. I don't know. But yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I would think so too. Yeah. It's like an

1297
01:22:15.52 --> 01:22:21.76
overlap. Yeah. It's a bunch of overlap there. Because yes. And so to sum this up, learn how to fight.

1298
01:22:21.76 --> 01:22:26.40
Right. Learn not about it. My 100%. Brad, don't listen to that weirdo article man. The thing is

1299
01:22:26.40 --> 01:22:32.08
there's a good chance that it was like a one of those parody whatever. Yeah. I forget what even it was

1300
01:22:32.08 --> 01:22:39.20
on like website. Yeah. But it wasn't on like a parody website. I don't I didn't recognize it

1301
01:22:39.20 --> 01:22:44.56
as a parody website. But I don't remember the website to be honest with you. I just saw these weird

1302
01:22:44.56 --> 01:22:51.20
things to me. It was it was the kind of all of the items on his little list were like were wrong.

1303
01:22:51.20 --> 01:22:55.20
Fighting was just the one that I felt. It's not as about the whole thing was just wrong. Yeah.

1304
01:22:55.20 --> 01:23:04.08
This is joke. Big joke. Tell me what's up. He used everything's big joke. Okay. So as I was

1305
01:23:04.08 --> 01:23:09.60
wrapping up that last one, he says that you can study war. You can exercise yourself in a war.

1306
01:23:10.64 --> 01:23:15.44
Two different ways. He says one by action, the other by study. Here we go. Here's the action part.

1307
01:23:16.08 --> 01:23:24.000
As regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well organized and drilled to follow

1308
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:31.44
incessantly the chase, which is like hunting and patrolling by which he accustomeds his body to

1309
01:23:31.44 --> 01:23:38.000
hardships and learns something of the nature of the localities and gets to find out how the mountains

1310
01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:44.48
rise, how the valleys open out, how the planes lie and to understand the nature of rivers and

1311
01:23:44.48 --> 01:23:51.92
marshes and in all this to take the greatest care. Which knowledge is useful in two ways. Firstly,

1312
01:23:51.92 --> 01:23:57.84
he learns to know his country and is better able to undertake its defense afterwards by means of

1313
01:23:57.84 --> 01:24:01.60
knowledge and observation of that locality. He understands that he's,

1314
01:24:02.40 --> 01:24:08.48
any, he understands with ease, any other, which it may be necessary for him to study here after.

1315
01:24:08.48 --> 01:24:13.60
Because the hills, valleys and planes and rivers and marshes that are, for instance, in

1316
01:24:13.60 --> 01:24:18.48
Tuscany have a certain resemblance to those of other countries. So that with a knowledge of the

1317
01:24:18.48 --> 01:24:25.04
aspect of one country, one can easily arrive at a knowledge of others. And the prince that

1318
01:24:25.04 --> 01:24:31.60
lacks this skill, the essential which is desirable that a captain should possess for it teaches him

1319
01:24:31.60 --> 01:24:37.12
to surprise his enemy to select quarters to lead armies to array the battle to besiege towns

1320
01:24:37.12 --> 01:24:50.48
to his advantage. So boom, go out, train, train incessantly, train incessantly, get out there.

1321
01:24:51.44 --> 01:24:55.76
That's what you have to do. And now, so that's the action part and the other part now here.

1322
01:24:55.76 --> 01:25:04.64
Now we get to the study part. To exercise the intellect, the prince should read histories and study

1323
01:25:04.64 --> 01:25:12.000
the actions of illustrious men to see how they have borne themselves in war to examine the cause

1324
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.80
of their victories and defeat. So as to avoid the latter and imitate the former.

1325
01:25:19.44 --> 01:25:24.16
Listen to this podcast. This is what we're saying. Read.

1326
01:25:24.96 --> 01:25:28.56
If you don't got time to read, press play. Boom. Get some.

1327
01:25:29.76 --> 01:25:34.56
I wish I had this podcast. I wish I had this podcast to listen to when I was 17 years

1328
01:25:34.56 --> 01:25:40.32
old when I was 19 years old when I was 23 years old when I was 33 years old when I was 37 years old.

1329
01:25:41.04 --> 01:25:42.08
Are you kidding me?

1330
01:25:44.72 --> 01:25:51.12
Yeah, that practice part is it seems like, oh yeah, that makes sense, you know, but I think that

1331
01:25:51.68 --> 01:25:56.72
I'm not sure if you read the whole thing, but it seems kind of even understated because like even

1332
01:25:57.60 --> 01:26:01.68
when you study something, you're like, okay, I know what to do. You do part seems understated.

1333
01:26:01.68 --> 01:26:05.52
The study part, more than action. The action part. Yeah. He says,

1334
01:26:05.52 --> 01:26:10.56
Incessantly, he says, I dicked yourself to exercise of war. I don't know if that's understated.

1335
01:26:10.56 --> 01:26:16.08
You're not. You're probably been read it well. No, no, no, yeah, maybe, you know, maybe it was just me.

1336
01:26:16.08 --> 01:26:21.04
Maybe I think it's just so important that that should be the whole book. I don't know.

1337
01:26:21.04 --> 01:26:24.48
Okay. Whatever, but either way, either way, then regardless of how

1338
01:26:25.04 --> 01:26:29.84
but trading is so important to you as what you're saying. I think that actually doing it is because

1339
01:26:29.84 --> 01:26:35.92
without it, you just lose, I think you lose more than half. If you consider study action.

1340
01:26:35.92 --> 01:26:40.08
Right. And you don't do the action part. I think action is more than half. Or it feels like

1341
01:26:40.08 --> 01:26:44.16
you didn't even wait because like if you, um, let's say you haven't done the digital in a long time

1342
01:26:44.16 --> 01:26:51.52
or anything, you are correct when it comes to sports, but he's talking about actual going to war.

1343
01:26:52.16 --> 01:26:56.000
And you can't take a nation to war. You can't even take a platoon to war. You can't take a

1344
01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.56
company to war without going to war. So yes, you can do the training exercises in the field.

1345
01:27:00.56 --> 01:27:08.08
But there is absolutely a massive benefit to studying what has happened in the past.

1346
01:27:08.08 --> 01:27:11.84
And I'll tell you, from a leadership perspective, like if I was a business person, I'd be reading

1347
01:27:11.84 --> 01:27:18.40
about business business. Not so much business leadership books that this is how to lead,

1348
01:27:18.40 --> 01:27:25.68
but this is what happened in this situation. And the perfect example for me of that,

1349
01:27:26.40 --> 01:27:30.96
from the war perspective is about face by hack worth. That book is not a leadership book.

1350
01:27:30.96 --> 01:27:36.64
But when you read it from a leadership through a leadership lens, it's all about leadership.

1351
01:27:36.64 --> 01:27:42.000
It's all about leadership. And so you can take books that are about business. Not about like,

1352
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.52
hey, this is a leadership instructional manual. But hey, this is what happened in this,

1353
01:27:47.52 --> 01:27:52.08
as this company fell apart or this, like you study those books read those books, then it gives you a

1354
01:27:52.08 --> 01:27:57.44
little bit more of an advantage. But in both these, what you really should be looking for is the dynamics

1355
01:27:57.44 --> 01:28:01.68
of human nature. And you can figure out, like, okay, when people in this happen inside this company,

1356
01:28:01.68 --> 01:28:06.48
or this happen in this battle, people act this way, people act that way. And I understand them better.

1357
01:28:07.36 --> 01:28:11.04
If you're seeing it for the first time, just like we talked earlier about, if you see,

1358
01:28:11.04 --> 01:28:14.48
if you know an arm lock is coming, if you know how to defend an arm lock,

1359
01:28:14.48 --> 01:28:19.12
or you know what's coming, you at least know to pull your elbow in, right? If you read a book that

1360
01:28:19.12 --> 01:28:23.92
explains what happened in a battle or in a business scenario, and you go, okay, here's what happened

1361
01:28:23.92 --> 01:28:27.92
right here. I recognize it, maybe not exactly, but it's close enough, and I can expect this

1362
01:28:27.92 --> 01:28:32.40
response from the enemy or from the competitor or from my people. I can make an adjustment.

1363
01:28:32.40 --> 01:28:37.68
I'm at least not blind. Yeah, and that's kind of the part I was talking about where we're,

1364
01:28:37.68 --> 01:28:44.96
yeah, that's right. And I think that's right, even the inverse where it's like, okay, you can

1365
01:28:44.96 --> 01:28:50.56
let's say you study this. I know this, you know, I know that this is how it works, but you've never been

1366
01:28:50.56 --> 01:28:57.12
in the situation to recognize how it feels, you know, you know, so like training for war or whatever,

1367
01:28:57.12 --> 01:29:01.92
like let's say in your case, where you would always, you say you try your best to make the training

1368
01:29:01.92 --> 01:29:06.32
is realistic as possible. So that's the actual action kind of stuff, even just something that's

1369
01:29:06.32 --> 01:29:10.64
as simple as role, role playing, you know, where it's like you're trying to simulate, you're trying

1370
01:29:10.64 --> 01:29:15.84
to introduce the action part of it more so than it's study. Sure. I see what you're saying. You know,

1371
01:29:15.84 --> 01:29:20.40
so yeah, so when you find yourself in the real situation, yes, I'll give you a case in point.

1372
01:29:20.40 --> 01:29:25.60
You can read extreme ownership. You can read the academy of leadership. I'll have someone that's

1373
01:29:25.60 --> 01:29:33.68
read and read and studied both those books, listen to every podcast and roll in and be like,

1374
01:29:33.68 --> 01:29:38.16
hey, let's roll play this right here and be like, you know, put them in a scenario where

1375
01:29:38.16 --> 01:29:42.24
where the right answer would be to say, hey, like, that's my fault. Here's what I'm going to do. And they'll

1376
01:29:42.24 --> 01:29:47.92
they'll say, well, the team needs to do this and you just think yourself. So you, you are correct.

1377
01:29:47.92 --> 01:29:57.44
You have to put people in the action as much as you can because the observation of a situation

1378
01:29:57.44 --> 01:30:05.76
is not as effective a learning tool as the being involved in the situation. Yeah. I do actually

1379
01:30:05.76 --> 01:30:09.60
agree with you. Yeah, because just like in your in that scenario, you just kind of painted it. It's

1380
01:30:09.60 --> 01:30:16.72
usually, well, I would imagine you could tell me, is it because their feelings almost kind of blocked

1381
01:30:16.72 --> 01:30:21.60
their knowledge at that point in a way? Yes, you know, yes. Yes. So if you're in the situation,

1382
01:30:21.60 --> 01:30:25.76
you are now kind of familiar with the feelings that come along with. And for instance, you have to

1383
01:30:25.76 --> 01:30:29.68
learn how to detach. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So if you don't know how to detach and I throw

1384
01:30:29.68 --> 01:30:33.52
something actually, you know how you detach because you know what the right answer is, but you don't do it.

1385
01:30:33.52 --> 01:30:40.08
You can't do it. You don't do it. So that's, that's a problem. So yes, put yourself, put people,

1386
01:30:40.08 --> 01:30:47.68
put your team, put yourself, not just study it. Okay. Here's the, here's what you do. You study it.

1387
01:30:47.68 --> 01:30:53.44
And then from the study, you try and formulate a simulation that you can put yourself into.

1388
01:30:53.44 --> 01:30:58.80
There you go. There's the answer. There's the answer. Last little section about this,

1389
01:30:59.52 --> 01:31:08.08
a wise prince, not never in peaceful times, stand idle. But increases resources with industry in

1390
01:31:08.08 --> 01:31:14.72
such a way that they may be available to him in adversity. So that if fortune chances, it may

1391
01:31:14.72 --> 01:31:23.76
find him prepared to resist her blows. He's really into, in the peacetime, you are harder.

1392
01:31:23.76 --> 01:31:32.000
Yeah. And know what? I'm going to agree with him. Next, every prince ought to desire to be

1393
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:41.52
considered, clement and not cruel. That's, again, this is not tradition. Mac you've elli.

1394
01:31:41.52 --> 01:31:47.84
But then he says, nevertheless, he ought to take care not to misuse this clement. So show mercy, but don't

1395
01:31:47.84 --> 01:31:54.32
get crazy. Beep. There's a dichotomy. Don't get crazy with the mercy. This dichotomy. Like be very

1396
01:31:54.32 --> 01:31:58.96
merciful, but don't get be overly merciful. You gotta be balanced. Can't be a softy. Get me a softy.

1397
01:31:58.96 --> 01:32:04.72
A prince so long as he keeps his subjects united in loyal, ought not to mind the reproach of cruelty

1398
01:32:04.72 --> 01:32:11.76
because with a few examples. So he's, hey, if you're considered cruel, sometimes, that's okay.

1399
01:32:12.64 --> 01:32:21.04
This is tradition. This. Because with a few examples, he will be more merciful than those who

1400
01:32:21.04 --> 01:32:27.36
through too much mercy allow disorders to arise from which follow mergers or robberies.

1401
01:32:28.24 --> 01:32:34.16
For these are want to injure the whole people, whilst those executions, which originate with the

1402
01:32:34.16 --> 01:32:39.84
prince offend the individual of the. So every once in a while, if somebody gets out of line,

1403
01:32:39.84 --> 01:32:44.96
you gotta, you gotta kill him. You gotta execute him. Okay. And that is actually going to keep the

1404
01:32:44.96 --> 01:32:50.64
people more under control. More so the little discipline, gauge you can more freedom. Right. The little

1405
01:32:50.64 --> 01:32:55.60
discipline is freedom. No, not one. I think that's the old making eggs in example. For a

1406
01:32:55.60 --> 01:33:01.20
little make an example. But what he said is, hey, the example of the hurts one person. Yeah.

1407
01:33:01.20 --> 01:33:07.44
So that's cool. Yeah. Here's the famous section when I'll read a pretty big chunk of it.

1408
01:33:07.44 --> 01:33:14.80
Upon this, a question arises whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved.

1409
01:33:14.80 --> 01:33:22.24
It may be answered that one should wish to be both. But because it is difficult to unite them in one

1410
01:33:22.24 --> 01:33:28.24
person, it is much safer to be feared than loved when of the two either must be dispatched with.

1411
01:33:28.24 --> 01:33:33.52
So he's saying the best thing you could do is balance your dichotomy. That's the best thing to do.

1412
01:33:34.64 --> 01:33:39.04
Because this is to be asserted in general of men that they are ungrateful.

1413
01:33:39.76 --> 01:33:46.08
Fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed, they are yours entirely. So he's

1414
01:33:46.08 --> 01:33:49.68
saying, look, people are kind of dastardly. But as long as you're doing good, as long as you're

1415
01:33:49.68 --> 01:33:55.12
successful, you'll be fine. But when you're being successfully, he says they will offer you

1416
01:33:55.12 --> 01:34:01.20
their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant.

1417
01:34:01.92 --> 01:34:09.04
So as long as I'm doing good, Echos, I'll be there for you. But when it approaches,

1418
01:34:09.04 --> 01:34:13.44
they turn against you. And that prints who relying entirely on their promises

1419
01:34:13.44 --> 01:34:18.88
has neglected other precautions is ruined. Because friendship, this is a big critical

1420
01:34:18.88 --> 01:34:27.04
differentiation. Because friendships that are obtained by payments and not by greatness or no

1421
01:34:27.04 --> 01:34:32.32
ability of mind may indeed be earned, but they are not secured. And in time of need, they cannot

1422
01:34:32.32 --> 01:34:37.92
be relied upon. And men have less scrupal and offending one who is beloved than one who is feared

1423
01:34:37.92 --> 01:34:43.20
for love is preserved by the link of obligation, which owing to the baseless of men is broken at

1424
01:34:43.20 --> 01:34:48.56
every opportunity for their advantage. But fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never

1425
01:34:48.56 --> 01:34:57.20
fails. So I think one of the differences he's talking about, when I give you money, when I treat you

1426
01:34:57.20 --> 01:35:04.96
well, when I am generous to you, you love me. But that's different, you know, that's different.

1427
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:13.44
That's not like a respectful love. Yeah. But then, and then he says this as well, nevertheless

1428
01:35:13.44 --> 01:35:19.52
a prints ought to inspire fear in such a way if he does not win love, he avoids hatred.

1429
01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.36
Because he can endure very well being feared, whilst he is not hated, which will always be as

1430
01:35:27.36 --> 01:35:31.76
long as he abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects from their women.

1431
01:35:33.12 --> 01:35:39.04
So he said, look, you can't just run rough shot over people and take the women and take their property.

1432
01:35:39.04 --> 01:35:46.24
Hmm. But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of someone, he must do it

1433
01:35:46.24 --> 01:35:52.40
on proper justification and for manifest cause. But above all things, he must keep his hands off

1434
01:35:52.40 --> 01:35:57.28
the property of others because men more quickly forget the death of their father than loss of their

1435
01:35:57.28 --> 01:36:08.24
patrimony. So yeah, firm but fair than he's saying. Yeah, yeah, overly firm. He's saying firm when you

1436
01:36:08.24 --> 01:36:14.32
have to be. Yeah. But fair is just as important. It's a dichotomy that you have to balance.

1437
01:36:14.32 --> 01:36:17.36
That's what he's saying. He just didn't write it as cleverly.

1438
01:36:21.84 --> 01:36:26.32
When a prince with his army and under and has under his control, a multitude of soldiers,

1439
01:36:26.32 --> 01:36:31.28
then it is quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation of cruelty. Again, so he again,

1440
01:36:31.28 --> 01:36:34.80
he's saying, when you got to be cool, you got to be cool. For without it, he would never hold

1441
01:36:34.80 --> 01:36:40.96
his army united or dispose to its duties. Among the wonderful deeds Hannibal of Hannibal,

1442
01:36:40.96 --> 01:36:46.32
this one is enumerated that having led an enormous army composed of various races of men

1443
01:36:46.32 --> 01:36:53.04
to fight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among them or against the prince, whether

1444
01:36:53.04 --> 01:37:00.32
in his bad or in his good fortune. This arose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty,

1445
01:37:00.32 --> 01:37:06.56
which with downless, which with his boundless valor made him very revered and terrible

1446
01:37:06.56 --> 01:37:12.24
in the sight of his soldiers revered and terrible. There's a dichotomy. He was revered and terrible.

1447
01:37:13.52 --> 01:37:17.92
But without that cruelty, his virtues were not sufficient to produce this effect.

1448
01:37:19.84 --> 01:37:24.48
Returning to the question of being feared or loved, I've come to the conclusion that men

1449
01:37:24.48 --> 01:37:29.20
loving according to their own will and fearing according to that of a prince, a wise prince,

1450
01:37:29.20 --> 01:37:34.96
to establish himself on that which is in his own control and not in that of others, he must

1451
01:37:34.96 --> 01:37:45.92
endeavor only to avoid hatred as is noted. So be balanced. And he said over and over again before

1452
01:37:45.92 --> 01:37:50.40
this that you know having the connection with the people and if the people are loyal like that's

1453
01:37:50.40 --> 01:37:54.16
the most important thing. If they hate you or if they don't like you, or if they're just afraid

1454
01:37:54.16 --> 01:37:57.68
you, they don't have that. Anything about it. When you're afraid of somebody and you have the chance

1455
01:37:57.68 --> 01:38:04.72
to to rise up and smash them down, you don't want to live in fear. So.

1456
01:38:07.92 --> 01:38:14.000
Next section, everyone admits how praise worthy it is in a prince to keep faith and to live with

1457
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:20.72
integrity and not with craft and he used that word craft meaning like, guy-o and sort of, yeah.

1458
01:38:20.72 --> 01:38:25.84
Yeah. Nevertheless, our experiences have been that those princes who have done great things

1459
01:38:25.84 --> 01:38:31.76
have had good faith of little account and have known how to circumvent the intellect of men

1460
01:38:31.76 --> 01:38:38.48
by craft. And if in the end overcome those who relied on their work, you must know there are

1461
01:38:38.48 --> 01:38:44.32
two ways of contesting. One by law, the other by force, the first method is proper to men,

1462
01:38:44.32 --> 01:38:50.16
the second to beasts. But because the first is frequently not sufficient, it is necessary to

1463
01:38:50.16 --> 01:38:57.60
have recourse to the second. So look, we want to do things that run nice way. But if we have to,

1464
01:38:58.32 --> 01:39:04.48
got to get a little savage. There is, therefore, it is necessary for a prince to understand how to

1465
01:39:04.48 --> 01:39:10.32
avail himself of the beast and the man. Again, this is an dichotomy. You've got to know that

1466
01:39:10.32 --> 01:39:19.44
sometimes you've got to get, get nuts and sometimes you've got to not. It is necessary for a prince

1467
01:39:19.44 --> 01:39:25.20
know how to make use of both natures. And that one without the other is not as durable. A prince,

1468
01:39:25.20 --> 01:39:30.72
therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion,

1469
01:39:30.72 --> 01:39:35.60
because the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against

1470
01:39:35.60 --> 01:39:42.40
wolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves.

1471
01:39:42.40 --> 01:39:46.80
Those who rely simply on the lion do not understand what they are about.

1472
01:39:46.80 --> 01:39:55.92
So he, who has known best how to employ the fox, has succeeded the best. There you go.

1473
01:39:56.96 --> 01:40:00.40
You know, can't just be the Brick Brute. You got to have a little bit of that.

1474
01:40:04.16 --> 01:40:08.48
But it is necessary to know of, this is where you get, this is going traditional

1475
01:40:08.48 --> 01:40:14.88
Machiavellian attitude. It is necessary to know how well, well, to know well how to disguise

1476
01:40:14.88 --> 01:40:20.56
this characteristic and to be a great pretender and dissembler. And men are so simple and so

1477
01:40:20.56 --> 01:40:25.20
subject to present necessities that he who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will

1478
01:40:25.20 --> 01:40:28.88
allow himself to be deceived. There is a soccer born every minute. So he's saying, you got to

1479
01:40:28.88 --> 01:40:34.24
act these ways, but you got to cover it up. Which is going back to Richard III. Hey, I'm going to cover

1480
01:40:34.24 --> 01:40:37.76
this stuff and make it up. Make it look like I'm the saint. Really, I'm the devil.

1481
01:40:37.76 --> 01:40:45.60
Uh, a Prince, especially a new one, cannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed,

1482
01:40:45.60 --> 01:40:50.88
being often forced in order to maintain the state to act contrary to fidelity,

1483
01:40:50.88 --> 01:40:56.08
friendship, humanity and religion. So he's saying, look, those are those the the nice ways to act,

1484
01:40:56.08 --> 01:41:02.08
but sometimes you can't you can't keep it. Therefore, it's necessary for him to have a mind

1485
01:41:02.08 --> 01:41:07.44
ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and variations of fortunes force it yet,

1486
01:41:07.44 --> 01:41:13.12
as I have said above, do not deserve diverge from the good. If you can avoid doing so,

1487
01:41:13.12 --> 01:41:19.36
but if compelled, then to know how to set it about. So hey, if you can, you got to be

1488
01:41:19.36 --> 01:41:22.72
you maintain your fidelity and friendship and humanity in religion. If you can,

1489
01:41:23.60 --> 01:41:28.32
if you can't, you got not to get after it the other way. That's what he's saying. And again, my

1490
01:41:28.32 --> 01:41:33.60
personal belief is if you do that, it's going to come back. It's going to come back and I'm not

1491
01:41:33.60 --> 01:41:38.16
again, like I'm not talking about a spiritual karma that's going to come back. I'm talking about

1492
01:41:38.16 --> 01:41:44.88
real life will come back. You screw someone over their time will come. You screw enough people over,

1493
01:41:44.88 --> 01:41:51.68
everyone's time is going to come. Yeah. And then it doesn't maybe I got it wrong, but so Jordan

1494
01:41:51.68 --> 01:41:55.92
Peter Sin for example, he'll talk about this too, right? Like where you have to be a good person

1495
01:41:55.92 --> 01:42:01.60
with the capability of being a bad person. That's optimum. The optimum thing is, hey, you can get,

1496
01:42:01.60 --> 01:42:07.20
you can, you can bring the thunder if you have to, but you shouldn't, you shouldn't have to. Yeah.

1497
01:42:07.60 --> 01:42:12.16
This is not quite that. This is saying sometimes, you get to do some underhand stuff. That's what he's saying.

1498
01:42:12.16 --> 01:42:17.20
He's saying, sometimes you got to do some underhand and stuff. Yeah. And I'll tell you back in these days,

1499
01:42:17.76 --> 01:42:22.72
I mean, think about how much more communication there is today. Yeah. You do something that's

1500
01:42:22.72 --> 01:42:27.92
out of line. Everyone's going to know it. Yeah. There's not going to take him very long to know it. Yeah.

1501
01:42:27.92 --> 01:42:32.64
Yeah. Yeah. Weird man. When you see, you know, some people, they're just sort of like that,

1502
01:42:32.64 --> 01:42:38.000
you know, and they're, you know, it's almost like they can't see very far ahead of themselves or

1503
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.64
something like that. Like they'll, like, oh, yeah. Yeah. They're just shortsighted and they just screw

1504
01:42:42.64 --> 01:42:46.72
this guy over and screw that person over and next, you know, they look up and they wonder why they

1505
01:42:46.72 --> 01:42:50.16
didn't get hired or they wonder why they didn't get the contractor. They wonder why they didn't get

1506
01:42:50.16 --> 01:42:55.12
promoted. It's like, oh, guess what you did? Yeah. And it's almost like I thought like,

1507
01:42:55.12 --> 01:43:01.60
well, shoot, I didn't like, I didn't screw you over. Like, why are you acting like this kind of thing?

1508
01:43:01.60 --> 01:43:08.32
Or why are you treating me like this? Like, I'm some, you know, Fox or Clever, what a craft person,

1509
01:43:08.32 --> 01:43:12.64
or whatever. But meanwhile, everyone's seeing what you're doing. No, it's just because you didn't do

1510
01:43:12.64 --> 01:43:18.32
to me. No, bro. We know all kinds of people. One of the one of the hardest things for some people

1511
01:43:18.32 --> 01:43:29.60
is they think that they're a Fox. They think that they can get one over on you. And, and they just,

1512
01:43:29.60 --> 01:43:35.20
they just, it's so obvious. Like you said, it's so obvious. You're looking at them going, hey, man,

1513
01:43:35.20 --> 01:43:39.36
everyone, not just me. Everyone can see you. And you know what? Sometimes people,

1514
01:43:39.92 --> 01:43:44.48
sometimes not everyone can see what they're doing. And if you're, and they think they're getting

1515
01:43:44.48 --> 01:43:48.88
away with something and you're looking at them going, man, I can see right through what you're doing.

1516
01:43:48.88 --> 01:43:54.24
Yeah. Why are you doing this? Yeah. Because I can see exactly what you're doing. Yeah.

1517
01:43:54.24 --> 01:43:59.52
You, and the fact that you're doing it, and I, you don't think I can see that you're doing it,

1518
01:43:59.52 --> 01:44:04.72
it proves two things. Number one, you don't think I'm very smart. And number two, you're

1519
01:44:04.72 --> 01:44:10.32
underhanded. Yeah. Neither one of those is going to work out for you. Because this is not my

1520
01:44:10.32 --> 01:44:16.16
first rodeo. And I'm watching what you're doing. And this is going to come back in a very hard way

1521
01:44:16.16 --> 01:44:22.000
on you. Yeah. Don't do that. Yeah. And there's that. There's varying levels of that too. Like,

1522
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.48
you can be like real devious stuff. You know, it can be that. But it can be like a little harmful

1523
01:44:26.48 --> 01:44:30.72
things too. And then, and the point there is semi-harm, you meant to say, hard lesson.

1524
01:44:30.72 --> 01:44:35.92
semi-harmless things. Yeah. semi-harmless things. But there's, but also sometimes,

1525
01:44:35.92 --> 01:44:40.56
and I always try and get people to pay attention to this. If you're underhanded with me,

1526
01:44:40.56 --> 01:44:46.32
if you try to sneak one by me, it's a trust violation. Yeah. That's a problem. Yeah.

1527
01:44:46.32 --> 01:44:51.04
That's a problem. And you know what? I'm not going to confront you. But I know you. Yeah.

1528
01:44:51.04 --> 01:44:55.36
And it's even worse. It would be better off for you if I just came and said, hey, echo.

1529
01:44:55.36 --> 01:44:58.24
Yeah. You know, you tried to slide this one under on the expense account.

1530
01:44:58.88 --> 01:45:03.44
And you bought, you know, whatever. You took your family out for dinner on the company credit card.

1531
01:45:03.44 --> 01:45:08.48
Mm-hmm. And I saw that. And you shouldn't do that. That would be better.

1532
01:45:09.60 --> 01:45:13.92
Then you mean you'd be better for you. Yeah. For little money. Yeah. For little plans.

1533
01:45:13.92 --> 01:45:19.12
Then me not saying anything. Yeah. Just noting it. And now I'm cracking you. Yeah. Because it's like

1534
01:45:19.92 --> 01:45:24.72
my knowledge of that kind of gives me a foot to stand on so I can kind of maneuver. So I can continue

1535
01:45:24.72 --> 01:45:29.76
to maneuver and I didn't say anything. Yeah. And I won't say anything. I'll let you, I'll let you

1536
01:45:29.76 --> 01:45:36.72
continue to reveal your dark arts, my cards. Yes. Reveal your, reveal your nature.

1537
01:45:36.72 --> 01:45:42.08
Yeah. Your nature is cheating. Your nature is stealing from me. You're looking at me like

1538
01:45:42.08 --> 01:45:46.08
like I actually did. I'm trying to think, shoot. Did I do that right now? Thanks a lot.

1539
01:45:49.44 --> 01:45:54.32
But I'm just saying think about it. But the point of what you're saying like whenever

1540
01:45:54.32 --> 01:45:58.16
you're all this year, I'll just run this. This is combining it right now.

1541
01:45:58.16 --> 01:46:03.84
You know, through that expense report, your head boy would, when people can see you, but they

1542
01:46:03.84 --> 01:46:10.08
can't see themselves. You know, you know, even with like small stuff, big stuff small stuff,

1543
01:46:10.08 --> 01:46:14.72
whatever one, everyone can see what you're doing, everyone. And my point is not every, not,

1544
01:46:14.72 --> 01:46:21.04
it's not always that everyone can see. Sometimes not everyone can see. And that actually encourages

1545
01:46:21.04 --> 01:46:27.52
a person to continue their little crafty ways that they think they're so good at. And it's so,

1546
01:46:29.84 --> 01:46:36.32
when when I see that happening, it's just so disappointing. It's so disappointing because you're not

1547
01:46:36.32 --> 01:46:42.000
even in a situation where you're with me because like, oh, you know, I brought you to my house.

1548
01:46:42.80 --> 01:46:46.40
Basically if someone's going to be able to do that to me, they're in my house. If you're in my house

1549
01:46:46.40 --> 01:46:51.44
and you're trying to, you know, steal some milk from the drawer when I'm not looking,

1550
01:46:52.08 --> 01:46:56.32
sure, without permission. Yeah. Like you're trying to, that thing in your bag,

1551
01:46:56.32 --> 01:47:00.56
you could, if you would ask me, you'd have, you'd have had a case of milk, but you didn't ask

1552
01:47:00.56 --> 01:47:06.24
what you thought as I'm going to try and get this. That's a whole different way thing, shake out.

1553
01:47:07.20 --> 01:47:10.24
And I'm not even going to say anything to you. It's going to be like, oh, that's not

1554
01:47:10.24 --> 01:47:16.08
saying anything to you. You can have that milk. That milk, it was worth it because now I know your nature.

1555
01:47:16.88 --> 01:47:22.16
So the torment is kind of the punishments. No, but okay, so back to it. There won't be any punishment.

1556
01:47:22.16 --> 01:47:26.80
Right. But, but, but in a year, you're going to look up and be like, hey, I know that we got this

1557
01:47:26.80 --> 01:47:30.64
opportunity. I'm saying, oh, yeah, yeah, I took the opportunity on foot. The amount of room for you,

1558
01:47:30.64 --> 01:47:35.12
and the opportunity. There's exactly it. There you go. That's what happens. But when I

1559
01:47:35.12 --> 01:47:43.92
say people can do, you can say, you don't want to say harmless ways or semi-harmless ways.

1560
01:47:43.92 --> 01:47:47.12
Yes, whatever. Of course. Even like the teeny teeny tiny things in the

1561
01:47:47.12 --> 01:47:52.000
we said this before like name dropping. Right. And that goes beer. That's not, it doesn't go into

1562
01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.12
DBS. That's not necessarily a DBS crafty thing or nothing like that. But I'm just saying the

1563
01:47:57.12 --> 01:48:02.96
concept of someone doing something where we all see what you're doing kind of thing.

1564
01:48:02.96 --> 01:48:05.76
You know, so you name drop someone is like, oh, it's just part of the story. But it's like,

1565
01:48:05.76 --> 01:48:10.80
probably, I'll see what you're doing right there. You know, but it's, I think it's hard for us.

1566
01:48:10.80 --> 01:48:17.12
Sometimes like I just named dropped Sam Harrison Timfers. No, I didn't feel like you did.

1567
01:48:17.12 --> 01:48:22.000
You know, then again, you did say their first and last name. So that's a symptom. No, because

1568
01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.76
I think the opposite, if I would have said, oh, well, you know, I was talking to Tim. I was like,

1569
01:48:25.76 --> 01:48:30.48
me and Sam were having a quick conversation. That's true. I think you told me that before

1570
01:48:30.48 --> 01:48:36.08
to end you're right. Yeah, it seems more, I guess it depends. But yes, yes, you're, Tim.

1571
01:48:36.96 --> 01:48:40.88
And then you're hoping in the back of mind that asked him who so you get to say, oh, just too

1572
01:48:40.88 --> 01:48:47.12
fair. No, you do. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe, but the point is people see what you're doing. But sometimes

1573
01:48:47.12 --> 01:48:52.56
it's hard for us to see that they can see that, you know? Yes, they're on the way. You got to stop

1574
01:48:52.56 --> 01:48:58.08
it. It's a sad thing. Assume that people can see what you're doing. There's a good lesson for the

1575
01:48:58.08 --> 01:49:04.80
day. Assume that the little maneuvers that you think are all clandestine, assume that people can

1576
01:49:04.80 --> 01:49:09.76
actually see assume that people are a little bit smarter than you think. Assume that you're maybe

1577
01:49:09.76 --> 01:49:14.000
not as smart as you think you are. Yeah. Because there's little crafty moves that you think are

1578
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:21.60
fooling people. They don't. And they reveal you your nature as being underhanded. People don't

1579
01:49:21.60 --> 01:49:35.60
like underhanded people, especially me. Yeah. Check. All right, moving on. For this reason, again, we're

1580
01:49:35.60 --> 01:49:42.80
talking about how sometimes you have to, you have to violate, you have to according to this,

1581
01:49:42.80 --> 01:49:46.96
sometimes people have to act a little underhanded. You have to act the EVs or whatever. And here's

1582
01:49:46.96 --> 01:49:51.28
what he says about that. For this reason, a prince ought to take care that he never let anything

1583
01:49:51.28 --> 01:49:57.36
slip from his lips that does not replete with the above-named five qualities that he may appear

1584
01:49:57.36 --> 01:50:04.96
to him who sees and hears him all together. Merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious.

1585
01:50:05.52 --> 01:50:09.76
So again, this is Richard III. And there's a whole backstory. I'll give one Richard III on

1586
01:50:09.76 --> 01:50:16.24
why Shakespeare wrote it that way. But he definitely wrote it that way. And clearly from that opening,

1587
01:50:16.24 --> 01:50:22.72
he's literally doing what it says in this book. Men judge generally more by the eye than by the

1588
01:50:22.72 --> 01:50:30.24
hand because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few, to come to touch with you. Everyone sees

1589
01:50:30.24 --> 01:50:35.04
what you appear to be, few really know what you are and those few do not dare oppose themselves

1590
01:50:35.04 --> 01:50:41.44
to the opinion of many. So how you look is how you're going to be judged. The prince must

1591
01:50:41.44 --> 01:50:48.64
consider how to avoid those things which will make him hated or contemptible. This is not traditional

1592
01:50:48.64 --> 01:50:55.04
McEvellian thought. It makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous, a feminine,

1593
01:50:55.04 --> 01:51:02.24
mean-spirited, irresolute from all of which a prince should guard himself as from a rock. And he should

1594
01:51:02.24 --> 01:51:07.68
endeavor to show his actions, greatness, or showing his actions, greatness, courage, gravity,

1595
01:51:07.68 --> 01:51:12.72
and fortitude, and in his private dealings with his subjects, let him show that his judgments

1596
01:51:12.72 --> 01:51:19.60
are irrevocable and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can hope either to deceive or get

1597
01:51:19.60 --> 01:51:28.88
around him. Good advice. And I guess one of my points is everything that's so check this out.

1598
01:51:28.88 --> 01:51:33.52
Everything that we're saying about how people can see what you're doing,

1599
01:51:33.52 --> 01:51:40.56
he's recommending that you act this way but no one will know and you just have to pretend like you're

1600
01:51:40.56 --> 01:51:44.88
actually a good person. And what we're both saying is that doesn't work and I agree that doesn't work.

1601
01:51:44.88 --> 01:51:50.32
So the idea that you're going to be all behind the scenes, you're going to be all crafty behind

1602
01:51:50.32 --> 01:51:55.52
the scenes and no one's going to catch you. And you're just going to act with greatness and courage

1603
01:51:55.52 --> 01:51:58.72
and act with gravity and fortitude and that's how you're going to act but you're not really

1604
01:51:58.72 --> 01:52:05.04
not that way. My point is that doesn't work because people can see through it and they will see through

1605
01:52:05.04 --> 01:52:08.48
it. They might not see through it today or tomorrow but they'll see it through it in a week or two

1606
01:52:08.48 --> 01:52:14.64
weeks or a month or a year and then you're going to be undone. That's a good word.

1607
01:52:17.44 --> 01:52:22.16
A prince ought to reckon conspiracies of little account when his people hold him in a steam

1608
01:52:22.16 --> 01:52:27.20
but when his hustle to him and bears hatred toward him, he ought to a fear,

1609
01:52:27.20 --> 01:52:32.32
he ought to fear everything and everybody. So if your people support you, don't worry about conspiracies.

1610
01:52:32.32 --> 01:52:40.48
If your people are hostile towards you, you better take note. And well ordered states and

1611
01:52:40.48 --> 01:52:47.04
wise princes have taken every care to drive the noble's desperation and keep the people satisfied

1612
01:52:47.04 --> 01:52:53.52
and contented for this is one of the most important objects a prince can have. Keep your troops

1613
01:52:53.52 --> 01:53:01.44
keep the people in the game. There was never a new prince who has disarmed his subjects rather

1614
01:53:01.44 --> 01:53:08.000
when he has found them disarmed, he's always armed them because by arming them, those arms become

1615
01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:13.76
yours. Those men who were distrusted become faithful and those who were faithful are kept so

1616
01:53:13.76 --> 01:53:20.48
and your subjects become adherence. Now I think where this really plays into from a leadership perspective

1617
01:53:20.48 --> 01:53:26.80
is when you get, when you are in a leadership position and you empower people, you give them power,

1618
01:53:26.80 --> 01:53:32.40
it builds faith, it builds trust, it builds and the power that they that you give to them

1619
01:53:32.40 --> 01:53:39.44
becomes yours. The more powerful you make your subordinates, the more powerful you become.

1620
01:53:40.32 --> 01:53:43.92
If you have the ego that you can put in checks so that you don't mind giving some of that power away

1621
01:53:43.92 --> 01:53:49.12
because it'll come back to you tenfold. And here's what happens on the other in the spectrum,

1622
01:53:49.12 --> 01:53:54.32
when you disarmed them, at once you offend them by showing that you distrust them either for

1623
01:53:54.32 --> 01:53:59.52
cowardice or for want of loyalty and either of these opinions breeds hatred against you.

1624
01:53:59.52 --> 01:54:05.20
And because you cannot remain unarmed, it follows that you turn to mercenaries which are a character

1625
01:54:05.20 --> 01:54:11.20
which are of a character already shown. So once again, if I take your power from you,

1626
01:54:11.20 --> 01:54:19.84
then that's offensive. So be careful. Give, try and give people power. Don't take it away from them.

1627
01:54:21.04 --> 01:54:28.56
It takes a high level of lead security and confidence with your own leadership that you can give it away.

1628
01:54:28.56 --> 01:54:32.24
The more you're, the more confident you are, the more you can give it away. The more paranoid you

1629
01:54:32.24 --> 01:54:37.44
think people are going to be better than you. The harder this give it away, the worse leader you are.

1630
01:54:37.44 --> 01:54:41.44
The worse leader you become. The worse situation, the less power you have. Do you try to hold it

1631
01:54:41.44 --> 01:54:52.64
all for yourself? Continuing, the best possible fortress is not to be hated by the people.

1632
01:54:55.28 --> 01:55:01.60
Not traditional Mackey Valley in thought. The best possible fortress is not to be hated by the people.

1633
01:55:01.60 --> 01:55:09.84
Yeah, it seems like it's dark. It's a great start. Because although you may hold the fortress,

1634
01:55:10.48 --> 01:55:14.56
yet they will not save you if the people hate you. The fortress isn't going to, if the people hate you,

1635
01:55:14.56 --> 01:55:19.44
the fortress isn't going to help. Don't even bother. Oh, you built up a great fortress cool.

1636
01:55:19.44 --> 01:55:24.24
We're going to see you. Yeah, because we hate no water, no food.

1637
01:55:24.24 --> 01:55:32.56
You hook and fire over the walls, continuing. Nothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great

1638
01:55:32.56 --> 01:55:42.80
enterprises and setting a fine example. Set a good example. Not traditional Mackey

1639
01:55:42.80 --> 01:55:48.40
Valley in thought. We're good one. The choice of services of no little importance to a prince

1640
01:55:48.40 --> 01:55:54.16
and they are good or not according to the discrimination of the prince. And the first opinion

1641
01:55:54.16 --> 01:56:02.000
which one forms of a prince and of his understanding is by observing the men he has around him.

1642
01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:07.28
And when they are capable and faithful, he may always be considered wise because he has known

1643
01:56:07.28 --> 01:56:12.32
how to recognize the capable and to keep them faithful. But when they are otherwise one cannot form

1644
01:56:12.32 --> 01:56:18.64
a good opinion of him for the prime error, which he made was not choosing them. So people, your team,

1645
01:56:18.64 --> 01:56:24.08
people look at you and they judge you by what your team is like. And if you surround yourself

1646
01:56:24.08 --> 01:56:31.28
with people that are incompetent and incapable, that's what people are going to think of. So use caution.

1647
01:56:32.64 --> 01:56:39.44
Next, when you see the servant, when you see the servant thinking more of his own interests,

1648
01:56:39.44 --> 01:56:47.12
then of yours and seeking inwardly his own profit and everything, such a man will never make a good

1649
01:56:47.12 --> 01:56:54.24
servant nor will you ever be able to trust him because he who has the state of another in his hands

1650
01:56:54.24 --> 01:57:00.64
ought never think of himself, but always of his prince and never pay any attention to matters in

1651
01:57:00.64 --> 01:57:07.20
which the prince is not concerned. So if you got someone that's thinking of himself, you cannot trust

1652
01:57:07.20 --> 01:57:15.92
them. Yeah. On the other hand, to keep his servant honest, the prince ought to study him,

1653
01:57:15.92 --> 01:57:22.000
honoring him, enriching him, doing him kindness, sharing with him the honors and cares,

1654
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:28.48
and at the same time, let him see that he cannot stand alone. So that many honors may not make him

1655
01:57:28.48 --> 01:57:34.72
desire more, many riches make him wish for more, and that many cares may make him dread chances.

1656
01:57:35.76 --> 01:57:40.000
So what's the best way to have loyalty with someone? Get treat him really, really well, you

1657
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:47.36
enrich him, you honor him, you share the honors that you get with that person, and then he

1658
01:57:47.36 --> 01:57:50.96
throw a hasty throw in a little dig, which is you got to make sure they understand that they're

1659
01:57:50.96 --> 01:57:56.16
not going to get that by themselves. He always throws a little dig in there, a little bit, he

1660
01:57:56.16 --> 01:58:00.08
distrusts people. He says it a bunch of times, people are, which boundaries, basically.

1661
01:58:03.68 --> 01:58:09.12
Oh, important section, how flatters should be avoided. I did not wish to leave out an important

1662
01:58:09.12 --> 01:58:14.88
branch of this subject for it is danger, for it is a danger from which princes are with difficulty

1663
01:58:14.88 --> 01:58:20.72
preserved, unless they are carefully, unless they are careful and discriminating. It is that of

1664
01:58:20.72 --> 01:58:28.64
flatterers of those of whom courts are full, because men are so self-complacin in their own affairs

1665
01:58:28.64 --> 01:58:34.56
and in a way so deceived in them that they are preserved with difficulty from the past,

1666
01:58:34.56 --> 01:58:39.60
and if they wish to defend themselves, they run the danger of falling into contempt. Because there

1667
01:58:39.60 --> 01:58:46.08
is no other way of guarding oneself from flatters except letting men understand that to tell you

1668
01:58:46.08 --> 01:58:52.08
the truth does not offend you. You've got to make sure people understand that if you tell

1669
01:58:52.08 --> 01:58:58.08
me the truth, I'm not going to be offended. But when everyone may tell you the truth, respect for

1670
01:58:58.08 --> 01:59:03.92
you abates. There he throws in the little slump, little counter, right? He doesn't want people talking

1671
01:59:03.92 --> 01:59:09.60
smack to him, but he wants him to tell the truth. Therefore, a wise prince ought to hold a third

1672
01:59:09.60 --> 01:59:14.32
course by choosing the wise men in the state and giving them only the liberty of speaking the truth

1673
01:59:14.32 --> 01:59:20.72
to him and then only of those things which he inquires and of none others. So you can talk to the

1674
01:59:20.72 --> 01:59:26.32
truth as long as I ask you. But he ought to question them upon everything, but even though I say,

1675
01:59:26.32 --> 01:59:29.68
hey, you only need to echo, you only tell me the truth when I ask you. But I'm going to ask you

1676
01:59:29.68 --> 01:59:35.12
everything and listen to their opinions and afterwards for form his own conclusions. With these

1677
01:59:35.12 --> 01:59:39.12
counselors separately and collectively he ought to carry himself in such a way that each of them should

1678
01:59:39.12 --> 01:59:46.08
know that the more freely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred. The more you tell me the

1679
01:59:46.08 --> 01:59:49.60
truth, the more I'm going to like it, the more I'm going to like you, outside of the easy should

1680
01:59:49.60 --> 01:59:58.000
listen to no one. Presue the thing resolved on and be steadfast in his resolutions. He who does not

1681
01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:04.48
otherwise is either overthrown by flatters or is so often changed by varying his opinions that he

1682
02:00:04.48 --> 02:00:13.84
falls into contempt. He continues on with his thought. A prince therefore ought always to take counsel

1683
02:00:13.84 --> 02:00:18.80
but only when he wishes and not when others wish. He ought to rather discourage everyone from offering

1684
02:00:18.80 --> 02:00:26.16
advice unless he asks it. But however he ought to be a constant inquire afterwards, a patient listener

1685
02:00:26.16 --> 02:00:33.60
concerning the things which he is inquired. Also on learning that anyone or on any consideration

1686
02:00:33.60 --> 02:00:38.24
has not told him the truth he should let his anger his anger be felt.

1687
02:00:41.44 --> 02:00:46.32
And if there is someone who think that a prince who conveys an impression of his wisdom is not

1688
02:00:46.32 --> 02:00:53.68
through his own ability but through good advisors that he is around him beyond doubt they are deceived.

1689
02:00:53.68 --> 02:00:59.84
Because this is an axiom which never fails that a prince who is not wise himself will never take

1690
02:00:59.84 --> 02:01:04.80
good advice. So if you look at someone and say, oh, oh that that CEO is doing a good job but

1691
02:01:04.80 --> 02:01:09.36
that's because he's got these guys with him. That's actually wrong. The CEO's got that good person

1692
02:01:09.36 --> 02:01:14.56
with him. Those good people brought him in and then listen to him. They get credit. He gives him credit

1693
02:01:14.56 --> 02:01:20.16
for that. And you know what's funny? That's good salesmanship. Listen to this. Therefore,

1694
02:01:20.16 --> 02:01:25.52
it must be inferred that good councils went so every they come are born of the wisdom of the

1695
02:01:25.52 --> 02:01:30.80
prince and not the wisdom of the prince from good councils. So he's saying, if you're listening to

1696
02:01:30.80 --> 02:01:36.24
what I'm saying right now, that makes you good. If you listen to this book, right, listen to the

1697
02:01:36.24 --> 02:01:40.80
words I'm saying and you obey him, that makes you great. You're not giving credit to me. You're great

1698
02:01:40.80 --> 02:01:46.08
if you do. Yeah. What? Like you're smart because you're so smart to listen to your good stuff.

1699
02:01:46.08 --> 02:01:52.40
That you taking this advice proves that you're brilliant. Right. Yeah. You, it's like, hey, if you

1700
02:01:52.40 --> 02:01:58.48
read this book, it proves that you're smart. Just only a smart person would only just look

1701
02:01:58.48 --> 02:02:03.04
on your smart person would take the advice of someone else. That's how smart you are. That's

1702
02:02:03.04 --> 02:02:10.48
like good salesmanship of the book. Do not let, do not let our princes accuse fortune for the

1703
02:02:10.48 --> 02:02:14.96
loss of their principalities after so many years possession. Okay. So he's saying, don't let, don't

1704
02:02:14.96 --> 02:02:22.80
blame luck. Don't blame bad luck. When you lose your principality, don't blame bad luck. But rather

1705
02:02:22.80 --> 02:02:30.24
their own sloth because in quiet times, they never thought there could be a change. It is a common

1706
02:02:30.24 --> 02:02:35.28
defect and man not to make any provision in the calm against the tempest. So it's common that

1707
02:02:35.28 --> 02:02:40.96
people when things aren't going bad, they just kick back. They cruise. They cruise. They cruise.

1708
02:02:40.96 --> 02:02:49.92
Instead of working. And when afterwards, the bad times came, they thought of flight and not of

1709
02:02:49.92 --> 02:02:55.12
defending themselves and they hoped that the people disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors,

1710
02:02:55.12 --> 02:02:59.28
conquerors would recall them. That's a good plan. Hey, if I get overrun, I'll just hope that the

1711
02:02:59.28 --> 02:03:06.56
conquerors are so bad that the people rebel and bring me back. And here he talks about what

1712
02:03:06.56 --> 02:03:11.44
fortunate and again, he uses fortune like luck. What fortune can affect in human affairs and how to

1713
02:03:11.44 --> 02:03:20.96
withstand her. I will hold it to be true that fortune is the arbiter of about one half of our

1714
02:03:20.96 --> 02:03:27.60
actions. But that she still leaves us to direct the other half, perhaps a little less. So he's saying

1715
02:03:27.60 --> 02:03:34.64
luck. Luck has 50%. 50%. That's a big number. Yeah. And you might go, well, it's 50%. Man, why

1716
02:03:34.64 --> 02:03:43.20
even try? Well, that leaves you 50%. That's actually a lot. He goes on. I compare her and he's hers.

1717
02:03:43.20 --> 02:03:47.60
He's talking about his fortune. I compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when the

1718
02:03:47.60 --> 02:03:53.84
in flood overflows, the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing away the soil from

1719
02:03:53.84 --> 02:04:00.48
place to place, everything flies before it all yield to its violence without being able in any

1720
02:04:00.48 --> 02:04:10.000
way to withstand it. And yet, though it's nature be such, it does not follow therefore that man,

1721
02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:17.68
when the weather becomes fair shall not make provision, both with defenses and barriers in such a

1722
02:04:17.68 --> 02:04:25.12
manner that rising again, the waters may pass away by canal and their force be neither so unrestrained,

1723
02:04:25.12 --> 02:04:30.72
nor so dangerous. So floods are real bad and they'll wipe you out. But when there's no flood,

1724
02:04:30.72 --> 02:04:36.32
you can build walls, you can build barriers, you can build canals, and then you can control that

1725
02:04:36.32 --> 02:04:45.36
that danger, that flood. Continuing on, so it happens with fortune, who shows her power where

1726
02:04:45.36 --> 02:04:52.96
valor has not prepared to resist her. And Thither, she turns her forces where she knows that

1727
02:04:52.96 --> 02:04:58.80
barriers and defenses have not been raised to constrain her. So that bad luck, if you don't work,

1728
02:04:58.80 --> 02:05:03.68
that bad luck's common at you. It's common at you. Kind of like the weather,

1729
02:05:03.68 --> 02:05:08.48
remember how you were saying, like you kind of like extreme ownership, almost situation where

1730
02:05:08.48 --> 02:05:15.20
it's not kind of, it is straight up. Yeah, like, yeah, you know, let's say I put a TV outside,

1731
02:05:16.80 --> 02:05:21.52
TV outside would be cool. It doesn't really rain much here, so it's, I don't really need to put

1732
02:05:21.52 --> 02:05:26.48
on a cover every day, you know, kind of thing, and then sure enough. The one day out of the year it

1733
02:05:26.48 --> 02:05:32.40
rains on your TV, no more TV, seems to say. But if you would prepare properly, yeah, even though it's

1734
02:05:32.40 --> 02:05:38.88
sunny, you just keep the cover on anyway, you know, just in case it rains. Good one. Yeah,

1735
02:05:38.88 --> 02:05:43.68
that's, you know, to me, that was the perfect example. And I think there's a majority of people

1736
02:05:43.68 --> 02:05:49.60
will find that through the perfect example. One last, last little thing to close this out,

1737
02:05:49.60 --> 02:06:00.16
and he goes into some some more kind of historical documentation and examples, but this was a good one.

1738
02:06:00.16 --> 02:06:06.56
So I just wanted to close it out with this. A prince may be seen happy today and ruin tomorrow

1739
02:06:07.28 --> 02:06:15.52
without having shown any change of disposition or character. And what that saying is normal face.

1740
02:06:15.52 --> 02:06:21.28
You just need to keep, like, regardless, things are going great, things are going bad,

1741
02:06:21.28 --> 02:06:28.88
guess what we're sticking with normal. No, that's how we're sticking. And that wraps up the book.

1742
02:06:28.88 --> 02:06:35.04
Again, a ton to think about a ton that does, there's, there's definitely parts of it that match,

1743
02:06:35.04 --> 02:06:45.36
kind of the traditional Mackey Valley Mackey Valley and common perception. And there's

1744
02:06:45.36 --> 02:06:52.48
plenty of it that goes against it. And I believe the right answer is balance. And it's more

1745
02:06:52.48 --> 02:07:01.28
balanced than people think it is. But speaking of, you know, bolstering up our defenses against the

1746
02:07:01.28 --> 02:07:08.88
whims of fortune or misfortune, you know, do you have any, maybe suggestions on how we could

1747
02:07:08.88 --> 02:07:18.40
share bolster and prepare for that? Yeah, a few ways. Back to the book real quick. And so let's

1748
02:07:18.40 --> 02:07:27.76
say to sort of sum up what is a way to sum up Mackey Valley and ways? Well, like I said, the

1749
02:07:27.76 --> 02:07:34.80
the traditional understanding and meaning of the word Mackey Valley is a negative. It means

1750
02:07:34.80 --> 02:07:38.80
hey, this person's underhanded, they're going to deceive. They're not going to care what kind of

1751
02:07:38.80 --> 02:07:43.92
destruction they leave in their path. That's what people think of, like I said, if you say, hey,

1752
02:07:43.92 --> 02:07:48.56
this person's a Mackey Valley and leader, everyone thinks, okay, they're going to be merciless.

1753
02:07:48.56 --> 02:07:52.72
They're going to just run rough shot over everyone. They don't care who they step on to get to rise to

1754
02:07:52.72 --> 02:07:59.20
power. Yeah. That's the, that's the, that's what the word actually means. But, but we just gave

1755
02:07:59.20 --> 02:08:07.04
example after example, it's not that cut and dry. Yeah. And he definitely introduces many dichotomies

1756
02:08:07.04 --> 02:08:13.84
to to that idea that you're just going to do whatever it takes to get to the top. He talks a lot

1757
02:08:13.84 --> 02:08:20.64
about these other more moderate and important things that you need to do as a leader to get

1758
02:08:20.64 --> 02:08:25.36
not only to get in a position, but to stay in position. So being having good relationships with

1759
02:08:25.36 --> 02:08:28.72
your people, making sure they understand where you're coming from, like, these things are not

1760
02:08:28.72 --> 02:08:32.48
considered when you hear the word, but you don't know any better. You just take the word for

1761
02:08:32.48 --> 02:08:37.36
what the word has become to mean. What the word means now Mackey Valley and is like, hey,

1762
02:08:37.36 --> 02:08:42.96
I will stop it, nothing to rise to the top. Yeah. And that's one of the reasons why I wanted to

1763
02:08:42.96 --> 02:08:48.24
cover this because even with that, even though he definitely leans in that direction and he,

1764
02:08:48.24 --> 02:08:52.32
what he said is like, sometimes you got to, sometimes you got to stab your somebody in the back

1765
02:08:52.32 --> 02:08:55.60
occasionally and then you got to cover it up to the best of your ability. That's what he says.

1766
02:08:55.60 --> 02:08:58.88
Yeah. I don't believe that. I believe when you stab someone in the back,

1767
02:08:59.44 --> 02:09:04.000
that person they may die, but they got a friend, they got a brother, they got someone else,

1768
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.36
they got someone else that you don't know, you don't recognize and at some point they're going to

1769
02:09:07.36 --> 02:09:14.32
come and get you. Yeah. So you have to, you know, you have to try and balance these dichotomies.

1770
02:09:14.32 --> 02:09:18.24
You have to try and, and that's not even balancing an dichotomy. That's just straight up like,

1771
02:09:18.24 --> 02:09:25.12
hey, you got to take, you got to treat people. You got to respect people. Yeah. And you've got to

1772
02:09:25.12 --> 02:09:29.36
not always look out for your own good and what I will tell you and what I know,

1773
02:09:30.16 --> 02:09:35.04
the more you look out for your own good and this is where, this is probably the biggest dichotomy

1774
02:09:35.04 --> 02:09:40.56
with this Mackey Vellian attitude. The more you look out for your own good, the worse off you're

1775
02:09:40.56 --> 02:09:44.56
going to be. Yeah. And the more you look out for the good of others and the more you look out for

1776
02:09:44.56 --> 02:09:49.36
your team and the more you put the mission and your and your people ahead of yourself, the better

1777
02:09:49.36 --> 02:09:55.36
off you'll end up in the long run. So that's in complete contrast to what the Mackey Vellian, the

1778
02:09:55.36 --> 02:10:01.12
common thought about being Mackey Vellian is. And I will tell you, when I work with companies,

1779
02:10:01.12 --> 02:10:05.60
the leaders that put their people ahead of them, the leaders that put their, that put the mission

1780
02:10:05.60 --> 02:10:13.68
ahead of themselves, they're always respected. They're always, they're always loved by the troops.

1781
02:10:13.68 --> 02:10:18.48
They always have support of the troops and they always go forward and do a good job.

1782
02:10:18.48 --> 02:10:23.92
The people that screw the people over, screw the team over, put themselves ahead, their ego's,

1783
02:10:23.92 --> 02:10:30.48
those people, those leaders never end up doing well. In the long run, sometimes you can do some

1784
02:10:30.48 --> 02:10:34.64
short-term stuff. Hey, I'm gonna screw Echo over and get promoted because I'm gonna, you know,

1785
02:10:34.64 --> 02:10:38.80
fill out a report that he didn't, you know, become a rat him out on this thing. Okay. Cool.

1786
02:10:38.80 --> 02:10:43.52
I rat you out, but what I don't realize is that you have another friend that's with us. That's

1787
02:10:43.52 --> 02:10:49.36
that that's your peer. Yeah. And now he's watching me and there's gonna be a opportunity for him to

1788
02:10:49.36 --> 02:10:57.52
rat me out because I miss something or I didn't do something. So if you form good relationships,

1789
02:10:57.52 --> 02:11:03.76
if you put your team and your mission and you put others above yourself, you're gonna end up

1790
02:11:03.76 --> 02:11:08.56
in a much better position than you will, stabbing people in the back and stepping on people to try

1791
02:11:08.56 --> 02:11:14.40
and rise to the top. Yeah. And not only that when you get to the top, you will be much more comfortable,

1792
02:11:14.40 --> 02:11:20.000
not only when you look yourself in the mirror, but also when you get to the top and you know that

1793
02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:24.56
the people below you and the chain of command actually want you there and actually will do anything

1794
02:11:24.56 --> 02:11:28.48
to defend your position up there. Yeah. That's a lot more comfortable than having to constantly

1795
02:11:28.48 --> 02:11:32.56
look behind your back and see who's sneaking up behind you. So do the right thing.

1796
02:11:32.56 --> 02:11:39.36
Sure. The right thing. Be good leader. Yeah. She worked as good. So kind of in a way it kind of goes

1797
02:11:39.36 --> 02:11:46.08
along. Well, really does go along with kind of what you say where like Matt. So okay, back in

1798
02:11:46.08 --> 02:11:52.40
L. N. Way, traditionally whatever could be put simply, maybe over simply, but simply looking

1799
02:11:52.40 --> 02:11:57.12
out for yourself. Totally. You know, kind of thing. Look out for Matt. What you say and what he ends

1800
02:11:57.12 --> 02:12:03.12
up saying is the best way to look out for yourself is to look up for the people. Like always talking

1801
02:12:03.12 --> 02:12:08.000
about these people, the people. Yeah. It's a people. So man, it's kind of brings it full circle in a way.

1802
02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:12.96
It does bring it full circle. And the full circle answer is take care of your people, take care of

1803
02:12:12.96 --> 02:12:17.92
your team. Look out for other people. Don't put yourself first. Yeah. If you do that, you're going to

1804
02:12:17.92 --> 02:12:22.08
end up, you might like I said, you might end up stepping up for a moment, but in a long run,

1805
02:12:23.12 --> 02:12:26.72
things aren't going to go your way. And even when you are on the top, you're going to be waiting

1806
02:12:26.72 --> 02:12:32.16
to get stabbed in the back. Yeah. Not fun. Yeah. Always in the more, more I think about it,

1807
02:12:32.16 --> 02:12:37.84
you kind of turned me on to the whole idea of the long game. You know, the more I kind of

1808
02:12:37.84 --> 02:12:43.12
open my eyes to like look at things, it kind of seems like playing the short game. Isn't the

1809
02:12:43.12 --> 02:12:48.72
smart game. It's totally ignorant. Yeah. Yeah. The short game. So when you figure it, and you can see it

1810
02:12:48.72 --> 02:12:54.24
too, where it's so obvious when people are playing the short game. Well, yeah, with everything, with everything.

1811
02:12:54.24 --> 02:13:00.80
Yeah. In fact, if you identify any one of your failures or the failures of others, whatever, but

1812
02:13:01.52 --> 02:13:07.92
try your own, if you identify any one of them, you'll probably trace it down to your playing the

1813
02:13:07.92 --> 02:13:12.000
short game in regards to that many times. You'll see your overweight or whatever you playing the

1814
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:16.48
short game, as far as like what you eat, what you're doing physically or whatever, you're playing

1815
02:13:16.48 --> 02:13:21.20
short game. You don't go, what the short term pay out for other than the big long term. Big. Yeah.

1816
02:13:21.20 --> 02:13:26.96
So if you can maintain that in your mind, I think play the long game. He'd be doing some good stuff.

1817
02:13:26.96 --> 02:13:31.68
Yeah. My opinion. It's a weird dichotomy that if you really want to do well yourself,

1818
02:13:31.68 --> 02:13:37.28
and the best thing you can do is take care of your people. Who's not yourself? Yeah, exactly.

1819
02:13:37.28 --> 02:13:42.72
It's a dichotomy, but it's the reality. It's a nice little blessing that you get at the end of the

1820
02:13:42.72 --> 02:13:47.12
day for trying to take care of people. They'll take care of you. If you take care of people,

1821
02:13:47.12 --> 02:13:51.68
they'll take care of you. Then to go one step further, if you take care of yourself,

1822
02:13:51.68 --> 02:13:57.76
and give yourself the capability to take care of more people, seems like it's never ending.

1823
02:13:57.76 --> 02:14:02.40
Well, if you take care, if you look to this, this is the opposite of what I just said.

1824
02:14:02.40 --> 02:14:07.44
The opposite of what I just said is if you take care of yourself as the primary,

1825
02:14:07.44 --> 02:14:11.44
you will end up being in a worse position than if you try and take care of other people.

1826
02:14:11.44 --> 02:14:16.88
Yeah. That's the reality. So if I'm, if I'm always looking out for me, if I act in the

1827
02:14:16.88 --> 02:14:22.16
traditional Mackey-Evelleian way, sure, I might get ahead right now. I might step on it.

1828
02:14:22.16 --> 02:14:28.96
I might get a short term when, here and there, long term, I will not be in a better position.

1829
02:14:28.96 --> 02:14:33.20
Long term, I will be in a worse position. Yeah. That's the way it is. Yeah, I was thinking more,

1830
02:14:33.20 --> 02:14:37.20
you know, the oxygen mask in the plane, you know, putting yourself in for your kids kind of

1831
02:14:37.20 --> 02:14:43.76
thing. But you know, it's a total thing, never mind. But everyone's in a while.

1832
02:14:43.76 --> 02:14:48.32
Every once in a while, you can find something that has both a short term and a long term.

1833
02:14:48.32 --> 02:14:54.80
Be off. Juditsu is one of those things. Short term, long term. Indeed. Big time.

1834
02:14:57.92 --> 02:15:02.96
Are there sacrifices? Why wouldn't you take Juditsu? And I'm not saying like,

1835
02:15:02.96 --> 02:15:08.40
you know, you, I'm just saying what it, what is the general, I don't have time. Number one. Number two,

1836
02:15:08.40 --> 02:15:13.36
there's all because then we want you, want you to get past that one. It's just a whole array of

1837
02:15:14.48 --> 02:15:21.52
reasons. I might get hurt. I don't like, I feel claustrophobic, which by the way, isn't even more

1838
02:15:21.52 --> 02:15:28.24
reason to do it because you should be trying to overcome that. One of the general intimidation,

1839
02:15:28.24 --> 02:15:34.72
you know, that general intimidation. Oh, whatever. Yeah. I don't try and something new. That's kind of like a

1840
02:15:34.72 --> 02:15:40.08
big thing. Scary. Yeah. Scary. I'm scared. Need to read Mikey in the dragon's butt. Go ahead.

1841
02:15:40.08 --> 02:15:47.76
Yeah. Nonetheless, if when we see fit to start Juditsu, if we haven't started already,

1842
02:15:48.64 --> 02:15:54.72
you're going to need a key and a rash card. Maybe some other stuff. No key and a rash card.

1843
02:15:54.72 --> 02:16:00.24
Yeah. I'm not perfect. Yeah. That is cool. And then yeah, I can't at me or at least some maths in a friend or

1844
02:16:00.24 --> 02:16:08.96
at least a friend. At least. Okay. Yeah. Better than nothing. Yeah. Sure. But when you get the key and people,

1845
02:16:08.96 --> 02:16:13.60
yes, people still ask what kind of key should I get? Just start it. What kind of key? Um,

1846
02:16:13.60 --> 02:16:20.88
origin, key from origin. Origin main.com. This is where you can browse as many keys as you want. Get more

1847
02:16:20.88 --> 02:16:30.16
than one. Um, best keys. Factually the best keys made in America from beginning to end made in America.

1848
02:16:30.16 --> 02:16:36.88
Beginning to end of the whole process. Designed by people that do Juditsu. Yeah. Not by a random person

1849
02:16:36.88 --> 02:16:42.48
that doesn't train. Yeah. Not by a person that looked in Ikeedow ghee. Yeah. And said, oh yeah, well,

1850
02:16:42.48 --> 02:16:50.32
that's no a ghee. Yeah. But a person that says, oh, I do Juditsu. Yeah. Daily. And I need to make the best

1851
02:16:50.32 --> 02:16:54.56
possible. I compete in Juditsu and I'm going to make the best possible ghee. Yeah. That's where you

1852
02:16:54.56 --> 02:17:00.56
get the origin. Yeah. Well, there you go. You're welcome. And then we're going to make it in America.

1853
02:17:00.56 --> 02:17:07.92
Yeah. I wish I knew that before I bought my first ghee. I bought from the academy. Did I buy it

1854
02:17:07.92 --> 02:17:13.12
from the academy? Yeah. I bought it from the academy. The boxing club. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's a worst

1855
02:17:13.12 --> 02:17:17.36
guy, right? Ever. Yeah. And here's the thing. And that's, that's what geese are like. Yeah. That's

1856
02:17:17.36 --> 02:17:22.48
the right. I didn't know. I didn't know. So then I bought like I went and I saw one from a guy.

1857
02:17:22.48 --> 02:17:26.56
I got one on that. I was like, oh, that looks cool. The logo looks cool. Even when I felt it,

1858
02:17:26.56 --> 02:17:31.60
I was like, oh, that looks beefy. Yeah. I went and got mine and it was like, it shrunk a little

1859
02:17:31.60 --> 02:17:38.16
bit too much. And it was like, it didn't fit that good. It was like, there were some scenarios where

1860
02:17:38.16 --> 02:17:43.68
it felt like a straight jacket. Mm-hmm. And which, you know, it depends on who you are, whatever,

1861
02:17:43.68 --> 02:17:48.56
but it was just so thick and maybe might have been too small. I don't know. But nonetheless,

1862
02:17:48.56 --> 02:17:52.64
no point did me in the right direction. That's the point. That's the point. Yes. Now you're being told.

1863
02:17:52.64 --> 02:17:57.12
So now you are telling people, doing the telling? Yes. You don't want to be in a straight jacket.

1864
02:17:57.12 --> 02:18:01.44
No, you don't want to be in a very comfortable comfortable. Which you are.

1865
02:18:01.44 --> 02:18:07.36
Fun highly skilled at assessing confidence. I see you speak to you. Yeah.

1866
02:18:07.36 --> 02:18:11.84
But here's the thing in jujitsu. If the ghee is comfortable, that's a good thing. I mean, hey,

1867
02:18:11.84 --> 02:18:15.68
if you're a song weirdo savage, who's like, you know what, that's going to be part of my training

1868
02:18:15.68 --> 02:18:22.000
to put on an uncomfortable ghee and hearted in my mind. There was a dude that used to train with

1869
02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:28.64
a wetsuit under his ghee just for discomfort level. Dartanian. He's still a jujitsu guy. He's out there.

1870
02:18:28.64 --> 02:18:34.64
He was like, he's on a hagsis training partner's park and jujitsu. Yeah. But he's still out there.

1871
02:18:34.64 --> 02:18:39.92
So is that kind of like the guys who are the the restricts. Yeah, the oxygen mask. I mean, whatever.

1872
02:18:39.92 --> 02:18:46.08
Well, you don't put on a wetsuit very often. But wetsuits are slightly, especially this is

1873
02:18:46.08 --> 02:18:51.36
this is 20 years ago that that this guy was putting on a wetsuit and training. And wetsuit have

1874
02:18:51.36 --> 02:18:56.32
come a long way. They're much more comfortable now and much more pliable. But back in the day,

1875
02:18:56.32 --> 02:19:02.72
you put on a three millimeter wetsuit. It was it was it was restricting your mobility. So just

1876
02:19:02.72 --> 02:19:07.68
do that in training, be hot and sweaty and uncomfortable. That's next level. Put the wetsuit on

1877
02:19:07.68 --> 02:19:12.48
underneath your orange and ghee. If you want more discomfort, there's your there's your answer.

1878
02:19:12.48 --> 02:19:17.92
Oh, right. If you're training for that. Yeah. I say 100% don't do that. That's what I would recommend.

1879
02:19:17.92 --> 02:19:22.72
No, I know you wouldn't recommend that. But it is kind of hardcore. It is hard cry. There's a certain

1880
02:19:22.72 --> 02:19:27.36
legitimate level of respect to have for Dartanian. Dartanian doing that. Dang. That's kind of

1881
02:19:27.36 --> 02:19:33.68
he's out there, man. There's a two. Did you get to just strong as hell? Yeah, just where in a wetsuit.

1882
02:19:33.68 --> 02:19:42.16
Good. Hey, man. legit. There's other stuff at origin too. Yeah. Like T-shirts and sweatshirts and

1883
02:19:42.88 --> 02:19:49.92
and by the way, we're gonna have jeans. We have jeans right now. What we do. Well, I do. Yeah,

1884
02:19:49.92 --> 02:19:54.72
because I lost them. I looked. I don't know. Yeah, I know you don't have a, you will get some soon.

1885
02:19:54.72 --> 02:20:04.72
But anyways, just like the ghee is awesome. Here's the problem with the ghee. You can't wear a ghee to

1886
02:20:04.72 --> 02:20:09.68
the store. Yeah. You can't wear a ghee to the restaurant. I mean, you can't technically,

1887
02:20:09.68 --> 02:20:17.52
but you wouldn't do that. So, you know, talking to Peter, I'm like, Pete, I love my origin geese.

1888
02:20:17.52 --> 02:20:23.68
I, I would, an origin geer on the house, maybe a little bit, right? But I said, Pete, I can't go out.

1889
02:20:23.68 --> 02:20:27.68
I need, I need, I need jeans. I need something. And jeans, guess what you can do in jeans?

1890
02:20:28.24 --> 02:20:32.96
Or I'm to the restaurant. You can wear them anywhere. You can swing a hammer when you're wearing jeans.

1891
02:20:32.96 --> 02:20:36.96
You can pour concrete when you're wearing jeans. You can go to the restaurant when you're wearing jeans.

1892
02:20:37.36 --> 02:20:46.64
Or jeans. Origin jeans. Coming. Very soon, we will have them available on the website

1893
02:20:48.16 --> 02:20:52.96
to pre, or, I think we're gonna do like a pre-order thing, just because we want to know how many to make.

1894
02:20:52.96 --> 02:20:59.28
But yeah, they will just start making them as fast we can. So made in America. What? The denim

1895
02:20:59.28 --> 02:21:04.88
itself compromised made in America. So the buttons American. What is things called that you,

1896
02:21:04.88 --> 02:21:11.12
that you fast enough to top the jeans, buttons. Yeah, the buttons. They will pass. The brass are made in

1897
02:21:11.12 --> 02:21:14.88
America. Everything's made in America. And they're sewn up in Maine by

1898
02:21:14.88 --> 02:21:25.52
serious craftsmen, legit crafts people. Yeah. American denim then straight up, bringing it back.

1899
02:21:25.52 --> 02:21:32.40
Bring it back. Origin, Maine, or German, also supplements. It's your been, man. I've been

1900
02:21:32.40 --> 02:21:35.60
just doing with the supplements. Right. Well, you're on the program right now.

1901
02:21:35.60 --> 02:21:40.80
Back on the program, like I'm back in G2, my arm is healed, but it's like really susceptible to

1902
02:21:40.80 --> 02:21:44.56
10 the night. It is, you know, like this kind of special with a twisting stuff. I don't know if I'm ready

1903
02:21:44.56 --> 02:21:50.40
for like any kind of legitimate ghee situation, but so after training, you could stiff.

1904
02:21:50.40 --> 02:21:56.40
Right. Just pound joint warfare, crew oil, whatever. Next day I'm like cool, but the day after that,

1905
02:21:56.40 --> 02:22:02.000
good to go. Yeah. It's like, yeah. It's good. Amazing. Then the last, but yes, joint warfare,

1906
02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:06.40
it's joint warfare is what it is for your joints. Keeps it together.

1907
02:22:06.40 --> 02:22:13.68
Crow oil. Same deal. Discipline. Just I've been on the discipline. You, you do a little bit.

1908
02:22:13.68 --> 02:22:18.56
You said to me like, because yesterday I trained kind of hard in that G2, and you said,

1909
02:22:18.56 --> 02:22:23.36
you were asking me what kind of G2 training feels best. And then you named a couple times.

1910
02:22:23.36 --> 02:22:27.76
A couple different types. And then one of them you said was like a three scoop of discipline.

1911
02:22:27.76 --> 02:22:33.12
Day. Yeah. Does it last like a the highest level? That was the highest level of good G2

1912
02:22:33.12 --> 02:22:38.000
day. Yes. It's three scoops of discipline. Yeah. Which, by the way, you can get in traffic thunder

1913
02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:42.64
flavor now. Yeah. I'm on that. We're waiting for a cease and disist level letter from a

1914
02:22:43.68 --> 02:22:49.44
from Jack Black. Yeah. Who is in traffic thunder? Robert Downey Jr. In Robert Downey Jr.

1915
02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:56.40
And Bench. Still. Stiller. Yeah, man. Well, until then, I'm still. Then we're just going to get

1916
02:22:56.40 --> 02:23:05.28
in a traffic thunder. Yes. It's good. I actually like that flavor very much. And I like the, you know,

1917
02:23:05.28 --> 02:23:10.32
the cognitive enhancement. Some stir. I'm just do the three. I'm going to try the three and

1918
02:23:10.32 --> 02:23:13.60
back on the program. I'm going to do the three. Oh, three scoops of discipline. Scoops. Yeah.

1919
02:23:13.60 --> 02:23:17.76
I did scoops. Uh, two scoops of the day. What do I want to win? It's good. Like it. What day?

1920
02:23:17.76 --> 02:23:22.72
Peter. Wednesday. Okay. What about Sunday? Oh, yeah. Sunday. Sunday. Sunday. Yeah.

1921
02:23:22.72 --> 02:23:30.96
Well, that discipline. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I sense the little bit of urgency. Yeah. Yeah. You know,

1922
02:23:30.96 --> 02:23:34.16
actually made me move. I was pretty impressed. That's actually the best I can hold for.

1923
02:23:34.16 --> 02:23:38.64
Right now. But hey, we're doing it one step at a time. You know, we're moving forward. Also,

1924
02:23:38.64 --> 02:23:44.000
if you want some additional protein in addition to your steak steak or sushi,

1925
02:23:44.72 --> 02:23:52.56
whatever, you know, whatever you gig is drink mok drink it every day if you have to. Okay. I

1926
02:23:52.56 --> 02:23:57.12
have I have talked about this before, but I stepped it up. Okay. So you can also get warrior kid mok,

1927
02:23:57.12 --> 02:24:04.08
which is for kids. It's got to it's it's the best possible thing you can feed a kid. They edited this out

1928
02:24:04.08 --> 02:24:11.60
when a tie was down doing the the week in the life of Jocco. Sure. I was like, I said something

1929
02:24:11.60 --> 02:24:17.28
along reliance of hey, when you're feeding your kids, when you're feeding your kids,

1930
02:24:17.28 --> 02:24:24.56
a soda, that's child abuse. I was going off. But so that's why I made warrior kid mok. So I'm

1931
02:24:24.56 --> 02:24:30.72
warrior kid mok because I have a bunch of kids myself and it's really hard to get kukids to eat

1932
02:24:30.72 --> 02:24:35.76
good food because it's either you don't have time to prepare it or you run and later you

1933
02:24:35.76 --> 02:24:41.76
whatever. Or so we made warrior kid mok. Yeah. Here's the thing. It tastes delicious. Here's what

1934
02:24:41.76 --> 02:24:50.96
it did yesterday. My daughter, she was making her dessert strawberries. I said here, let me,

1935
02:24:50.96 --> 02:24:55.20
can she usually take strawberries. She puts a whip cream on it and then she sprinkles warrior kid mok

1936
02:24:55.20 --> 02:25:01.04
on the top like a little dusting. It's really good. We had no whip cream yesterday. So I said,

1937
02:25:01.04 --> 02:25:06.24
hey, we got some heavy whip and cream and I've done this before, but I actually got the tool out

1938
02:25:06.24 --> 02:25:12.16
the proper mixing tool that spins real fast. Yeah. What's it called? Well, there's a bunch of

1939
02:25:12.16 --> 02:25:16.48
one but the one that I am familiar with is called the magic wand. Okay, mine wasn't that one.

1940
02:25:16.48 --> 02:25:21.84
The magic wand? Oh, no. This is like an oil, it's electric. It wasn't gas powered. But it just

1941
02:25:21.84 --> 02:25:26.56
like the traditional thing that you saw in the 50s, a little two little things that spin together

1942
02:25:26.56 --> 02:25:31.36
and you saw the egg meter. Yeah. Like an egg meter. So I'm sitting there with the egg meter. So I put in

1943
02:25:31.36 --> 02:25:41.60
heavy whip and cream and then I put two scoops of strawberry warrior kid mok whipped it.

1944
02:25:42.88 --> 02:25:48.64
Dude, it's ridiculous. It's completely ridiculous. And then put that on strawberry

1945
02:25:48.64 --> 02:25:54.40
yeah, it's like a whip cream. It's like whipped cream. So this is a whole another thing. This might

1946
02:25:54.40 --> 02:25:59.60
start a whole another sort of cultural revolution in this nation from our children. When they just

1947
02:25:59.60 --> 02:26:06.88
are eating warrior kid whipped mok cream, it's amazing. So anyways, give that a try. Interesting that

1948
02:26:07.92 --> 02:26:13.92
yeah, the egg meter, well, the magic wand is it's not, it's like maybe from the 80s. It's like a

1949
02:26:14.64 --> 02:26:19.52
it looks like. Yeah, you just stick it in your drink. Yeah, it makes whip. You can make like mail with

1950
02:26:19.52 --> 02:26:24.96
whatever. But from what I understand, I don't know, nonetheless. Yeah, it would have been

1951
02:26:24.96 --> 02:26:31.12
interesting to imagine you with one of those because it is kind of a dainty apparatus. So get some

1952
02:26:31.12 --> 02:26:40.40
of that get some of that mok for yourself or your children. Yes, all on originmain.com. Also

1954
02:26:45.92 --> 02:26:51.60

1955
02:26:51.60 --> 02:26:56.64
obvious once saying stand by to get some because it applies to you. It's a little bit of time.

1956
02:26:57.28 --> 02:27:01.52
Anyway, some new stuff. I was wearing a rash guard when I was working out this morning. Yeah, when I was

1957
02:27:01.52 --> 02:27:08.96
everything. Yeah, when I do, when I do a lot of ring work, when I'm using the rings,

1958
02:27:08.96 --> 02:27:14.64
yeah, sometimes you know you get the chief going on. Right, because the straps. So sometimes on this

1959
02:27:14.64 --> 02:27:22.16
particular day, and I did have a rash guard on this morning. Good. Also T-shirts. Shirts on there,

1960
02:27:22.16 --> 02:27:31.92
represent truckers hats and flex fit. By the way, or beanies. Sure. Check. Patches on there. I know

1961
02:27:31.92 --> 02:27:36.72
we were out of patches. We were. Okay. Sorry. I should have done a better job of paying attention to that.

1962
02:27:36.72 --> 02:27:41.52
Yeah, no, no, no. And no, it was my fault. And no, no, completely my fault thing. This is what I'm

1963
02:27:41.52 --> 02:27:48.40
going to do to rectify it, ordered more patches. We've got more patches in at this time. Also some

1964
02:27:48.40 --> 02:27:55.84
women stuff on there, some hoodies on there. It's basically, if you want to represent the path

1965
02:27:55.84 --> 02:28:02.40
that you're on that we're on, boom, that's where you can do it clothing was. Jocquist or dot com. That's why I

1966
02:28:02.40 --> 02:28:08.32
see it. Like that's how I see it as a whole. That's what it is. And subtle representation of the path

1967
02:28:08.32 --> 02:28:16.32
can also be done. Yes. On that store, you can check it out for yourself and see some subtle

1968
02:28:16.32 --> 02:28:23.20
representation of the. Yeah, deep. How should I say, deep representation? You know,

1969
02:28:24.88 --> 02:28:30.72
check. Yeah, jocquistorkort dot com and jocquity. What up with it?

1970
02:28:31.68 --> 02:28:38.16
Taste delicious is completely good for you. Isn't it weird that people would make foods that are

1971
02:28:38.16 --> 02:28:42.64
not completely good for you, but yet most people make foods that are not completely good for you.

1972
02:28:43.36 --> 02:28:49.84
Yes, jocquity is completely good for you. Well, it goes back to that. Yeah. Taste delicious.

1973
02:28:49.84 --> 02:28:55.20
Got a little caffeine, little hitter. It's not going to get you crazy. It's not a, it's not an energy

1974
02:28:55.20 --> 02:29:03.44
drink that makes you psychopath. Makes you addicted to caffeine. No, it's not that. It's gives you a nice little

1975
02:29:03.44 --> 02:29:10.64
hitter, little caffeine hitter, Theo. Yeah. Well, yeah, I mean, I wouldn't even say the caffeine is

1976
02:29:10.64 --> 02:29:16.08
significant. It's not nothing. No, it's 60 milligrams. That's that's that's lowered in a cup of coffee.

1977
02:29:16.08 --> 02:29:22.56
A two thirds of a cup of coffee. Yeah, that's something. Yeah, you feel it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1978
02:29:23.12 --> 02:29:28.16
But it's actually good for you. Yeah, and that's the thing going back to, you know, the short term,

1979
02:29:28.16 --> 02:29:34.56
long term or long game, short game. Yeah, that's the reason people sell food, drinks, whatever that

1980
02:29:34.56 --> 02:29:40.56
are not good for you. Because they're selling to the short game players. Yeah. The one that tastes good with

1981
02:29:40.56 --> 02:29:48.000
all the sugars and whatnot. Don't get on that path. No, don't even play that game. No, we're not playing

1982
02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:54.40
that game anymore. Jocquity, you can get it with tea bags or you can get it with in a can. Yes,

1983
02:29:54.40 --> 02:29:59.44
and I have lots of cans and I just crack them open and get after it. And obviously everyone already knows

1984
02:29:59.44 --> 02:30:05.60
that you get a 8,000 pound dead left with that. So check. There it is. Bill morning. I was on. Yeah.

02:30:27.04 --> 02:30:33.84
Kid soap at irishowch ranch.com. Young aid news of Warrior Kid up there. Making soap, building a

1990
02:30:33.84 --> 02:30:41.12
business, creating a brand. Yep. But most of all, milk and goats and turn it into something usable.

1991
02:30:41.12 --> 02:30:46.48
That's what I like. Working hard. Right. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Don't forget about

1992
02:30:46.48 --> 02:30:55.84
YouTube. We have a YouTube channel. It's called Jocobardcast. Yes. It's called Jocobardcast. This is where

1993
02:30:55.84 --> 02:31:03.68
Echo puts all these videos. He puts them on there, including these full podcast and including

1994
02:31:03.68 --> 02:31:09.76
excerpts and including enhanced excerpts that he goes all crazy with his old digital CGI stuff and

1995
02:31:09.76 --> 02:31:15.68
makes no mistakes. Well, sure. Sometimes also psychological warfare. You know what that is. I know

1996
02:31:15.68 --> 02:31:20.08
well, I know what that is. We're waiting for psychological warfare too. But in the unlikely event that

1997
02:31:20.08 --> 02:31:25.76
you don't know what it is. This is what it's. It's an album with tracks, jockel tracks, jockel talking

1998
02:31:25.76 --> 02:31:33.60
to you telling you telling us really how to get past these moments a week. That's cool in our journey

1999
02:31:33.60 --> 02:31:40.000
on the poem. Lifting. Cool. Wait, cool. Whatever we got to do. I gave you. I let you talk about that

2000
02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:44.88
right now. And you know what, you know what, I just figured this out. This is why you're like, yeah,

2001
02:31:44.88 --> 02:31:51.52
yeah, that's what it is. But move on kind of attitude. You know what? Because you don't use that.

2002
02:31:51.52 --> 02:31:56.24
You're not going to play the MP3 of yourself telling yourself, well, I don't know, maybe do,

2003
02:31:56.24 --> 02:32:00.72
but I don't think you do. You already have that MP3 embedded in your brain already. In fact,

2004
02:32:00.72 --> 02:32:06.08
that's what it is. Clearly what it is. But I do. So I know that. Yeah, you don't more than me.

2005
02:32:06.08 --> 02:32:11.20
Because it's weird because sometimes I do. And it's sort of like, it's sort of like the

2006
02:32:11.20 --> 02:32:16.96
the the Disponucleus Realme field manual. I did write that book, but sometimes I have to refer to it.

2007
02:32:17.52 --> 02:32:23.20
Yeah, sometimes I have to refer to it. And I'll tell you what, it's good. It's good to be able to

2008
02:32:23.20 --> 02:32:31.92
refer to something that actually states in no uncertain terms, the direction of the path and where

2009
02:32:31.92 --> 02:32:42.16
you need to walk, we need to move. It's very, there's a lot of clarity in it. And that's powerful

2010
02:32:42.16 --> 02:32:48.48
to be able to refer to something back like that. Yeah. So yeah, fully and yeah. So psychological

2011
02:32:48.48 --> 02:32:55.28
or first thing. When I listen to it, it definitely has an impact. There's no doubt about it.

2012
02:32:55.28 --> 02:33:00.96
Yeah. When you get psychological warfare and you click it, yeah, it's going to get through to you.

2013
02:33:00.96 --> 02:33:05.04
It almost like, I'm trying to imagine this right now. Like, let's say, okay, you know how

2014
02:33:05.92 --> 02:33:09.20
the night before you might have this problem, you might not, I don't know. But Leena,

2015
02:33:09.20 --> 02:33:13.44
the night before you're like, hey, I know you probably don't actually, hey, this is what I'm going to do tomorrow.

2016
02:33:13.44 --> 02:33:16.72
I'm going to take care of your business. I'm going to work out this at this time and I'm

2017
02:33:16.72 --> 02:33:20.80
do some business and then tomorrow come to like dang, I'm kind of not in the mood for that. So I'm

2018
02:33:20.80 --> 02:33:26.16
just going to, I want to do that today. I'll skip that. I'll opt out of that today because I'm not in the

2019
02:33:26.16 --> 02:33:35.68
mood or whatever. But what if you, if you have like a audio file of yourself telling you, hey,

2020
02:33:35.68 --> 02:33:41.28
this is why you should do this. Yeah, it would bring you back, I think. Yeah. Even if it's yourself,

2021
02:33:41.68 --> 02:33:46.96
you know, huh, interesting, interesting little phenomena, never explored that. Nonetheless,

2022
02:33:46.96 --> 02:33:52.32
good, psychological warfare. It's called psychological warfare. It's on, you know, Amazon,

2025
02:34:08.16 --> 02:34:15.12
don't hesitate in making psychological warfare, too. Yeah, I can play it to myself. Deal. Yeah.

2035
02:35:11.84 --> 02:35:19.36
Amazon music, Google Play, Extreme Ownership, the first book that I wrote with my brother,

2036
02:35:19.36 --> 02:35:25.68
Lave Babin. It's about leadership and that is followed up by the dichotomy of leadership,

2037
02:35:25.68 --> 02:35:35.04
which actually goes granular on the nuances of Extreme Ownership. So check that one out and

2038
02:35:35.04 --> 02:35:39.76
real quick back to Mikey in the Dragons. This, what's good about this book, and I was talking

2039
02:35:39.76 --> 02:35:45.76
about Lave talking about Lave about this morning. It applies to everything for a kid.

2040
02:35:46.56 --> 02:35:52.08
Because kids have to think about it. When you're a kid, when you're a kid facing the world,

2041
02:35:52.64 --> 02:35:59.76
everything is hard. Everything is scary. So you have all these fears to overcome and Mikey in

2042
02:35:59.76 --> 02:36:06.32
the Dragons, Lave's Lave throws that at his son. He says, hey, got to face these dragons and

2043
02:36:06.32 --> 02:36:11.68
fire them. You know? And that's what you do. You learn these lessons and it's a life lesson.

2044
02:36:11.68 --> 02:36:17.68
So Mikey in the Dragons gets some of that. What else? Escelon front? Speaking of Lave,

2045
02:36:17.68 --> 02:36:22.16
this is our leadership consultancy and what we do is solve problems through leadership. Me,

2054
02:37:14.16 --> 02:37:18.000
And these are going to sell it to the last one we did in San Francisco. They've all sold out.

2055
02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:22.80
But the one we just did in San Francisco, I had people calling me 10 days out personal friends.

2056
02:37:22.80 --> 02:37:25.44
I was like, hey, I just want to bring three people from my team and I'm like, oh, it's cool. No,

2057
02:37:25.44 --> 02:37:32.16
you can't come. We have a fire code. We cannot bring you into the building. Stop. Don't, don't come.

2058
02:37:33.20 --> 02:37:36.32
Because you know, you know, some people just figure you like, oh, you can just squeeze me in there.

2059
02:37:36.32 --> 02:37:38.72
Yeah, I just stand on the edge. I actually can't do that. Yeah.

2060
02:37:39.76 --> 02:37:44.88
They're all, they all have sold out. They're all going to sell out. So go there and register as

2061
02:37:44.88 --> 02:37:52.32
quick as you can. EF online is live is launched. What is that? I'll tell you what, if you can't

2062
02:37:52.32 --> 02:37:58.24
make it to a master or you can't afford to go to the master or you can't afford to bring 12 people

2063
02:37:58.24 --> 02:38:06.88
from your team to the master. EF online. That's what EF online is. We, the original intent of

2064
02:38:06.88 --> 02:38:11.68
EF online was to be able to train people without having them have to come to the master.

2065
02:38:11.68 --> 02:38:15.76
Given the same experience, given the same knowledge about having to come to the master.

2066
02:38:15.76 --> 02:38:24.88
So we did it. And EF online.com interactive. You get the briefs. You get to go through scenarios.

2067
02:38:26.64 --> 02:38:30.48
It's, it's powerful. It's way more powerful than I thought it was going to be. And I thought it was

2068
02:38:30.48 --> 02:38:34.16
going to be good, but it's better than I thought it was going to be. Yeah, it's interesting too.

2069
02:38:34.16 --> 02:38:37.76
Because I went through it. I went through it. You know, I was like, oh, yeah, you know, like,

2070
02:38:37.76 --> 02:38:41.44
cool. This is like just like what we talked about at the master or what you guys said about the

2071
02:38:41.44 --> 02:38:46.56
master, what I listened to. And then it's cool because at sort of at the end of the sections or

2072
02:38:46.56 --> 02:38:50.96
whatever, there's like a little quiz. I think the way the thing came out and we're continuing to

2073
02:38:50.96 --> 02:38:56.48
to work on it and we're continuing to upload new modules. So like, oh, and what's, and the other,

2074
02:38:56.48 --> 02:39:02.40
so one of the reasons that we made it was to, was to help people that weren't coming that

2075
02:39:02.40 --> 02:39:05.04
couldn't have come to the master, whether they were overseas or they couldn't afford it.

2076
02:39:05.04 --> 02:39:10.48
I didn't couldn't get time off. The other major demand signal was we work with giant companies

2077
02:39:10.48 --> 02:39:17.04
that have 100,000 employees. And I had one particular company with over 100,000 employees

2078
02:39:18.08 --> 02:39:23.04
said to me, hey, well, we want you to train every employee we have. And this was two years ago.

2079
02:39:23.60 --> 02:39:26.72
And I didn't have a good answer for them. And I don't like having to not have an

2080
02:39:26.72 --> 02:39:32.40
a good answer. Oh, you want me to travel globally for the next six months to all your different

2081
02:39:32.40 --> 02:39:36.16
factories. And it wasn't six months. It was probably going to take three and a half months or something

2082
02:39:36.16 --> 02:39:41.04
like that. That's not feasible. Like I can't just go off the grid everywhere else, not

2083
02:39:41.04 --> 02:39:44.56
recording podcasts, be traveling the world, the training people. Right? That's not going to happen.

2084
02:39:45.36 --> 02:39:50.24
So what are we going to do? EF online. Yeah. And so we got an enterprise with it too where you

2085
02:39:50.24 --> 02:39:55.44
can have your whole company training. And it's awesome. It's awesome. So get your people online. That's

2086
02:39:55.44 --> 02:39:59.68
EF online. And of course, one last thing, EF Overwatch. This is us connecting

2087
02:39:59.68 --> 02:40:06.88
proven, lead combat leaders from special operations and from combat aviation. And we're

2088
02:40:06.88 --> 02:40:15.28
bringing them into companies that need leadership in their organization to get problem solved.

2089
02:40:15.28 --> 02:40:20.56
Go to EF Overwatch.com. You want people that know and understand extreme ownership, no one

2090
02:40:20.56 --> 02:40:24.40
understand the laws of combat. No one understand how to balance that economy of leadership.

2091
02:40:24.40 --> 02:40:29.76
Go to EF Overwatch.com. Whether you're a person that's trying to hire or a person that's trying

2092
02:40:29.76 --> 02:40:35.36
to get hired if you're one of those vets going sign up there. And if you have anything to communicate

2093
02:40:35.36 --> 02:40:49.76
with us, we can be found on the interwebs on Twitter, on Instagram, and on the fish shbuki.

2094
02:40:49.76 --> 02:40:57.84
Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Joko Willink. And finally, thanks to all of our military

2095
02:40:57.84 --> 02:41:05.44
personnel out there for training hard and for holding the line as always against evil around the

2096
02:41:05.44 --> 02:41:12.80
globe. And also thanks to our uniform personnel here on the home front. And that includes police and

2097
02:41:12.80 --> 02:41:17.04
law enforcement firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and correctional officers and boarder

2098
02:41:17.04 --> 02:41:23.68
patrol and all first responders. Thank you and to everyone else out there.

2099
02:41:26.72 --> 02:41:33.84
Like Macievelli says in his book, not the one that you've heard about, but what he actually

2100
02:41:33.84 --> 02:41:39.36
says guard yourself from flattery by demanding the truth, especially the truth from yourself

2101
02:41:39.36 --> 02:41:46.64
and choose good people to be around you and set a good example by acting with courage and gravity

2102
02:41:46.64 --> 02:41:59.12
and fortitude and study the art of war. It's rules and it's discipline and keep your body

2103
02:41:59.12 --> 02:42:08.40
accustomed to the hardships and exercise your intellect with reading and last but not least.

2104
02:42:08.40 --> 02:42:20.56
Even when the weather is fair. In fact, especially when the weather is fair, make provisions

2105
02:42:22.56 --> 02:42:32.16
build defenses and barriers and dams and canals and protection protections against the rising

2106
02:42:32.16 --> 02:42:45.12
waters of misfortune. So even when things go wrong, you are ready to get out there and get after it.

2107
02:42:45.12 --> 02:43:01.04
And until next time, this is echo and jocco out.
