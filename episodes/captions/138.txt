00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.64 This is Jockel Podcast number 138.
00:00:05.64 --> 00:00:08.84 With echo Charles and me, Jockel willing.
00:00:08.84 --> 00:00:09.84 Good evening, I go.
00:00:09.84 --> 00:00:12.84 Good evening.
00:00:12.84 --> 00:00:18.64 Sir, the young seal whispered in a faint voice.
00:00:18.64 --> 00:00:20.68 Come here.
00:00:20.68 --> 00:00:24.84 Our hands were clasped in hand shake.
00:00:24.84 --> 00:00:30.72 On a formal handshake like two businessmen, but palm to palm with thumbs wrapped around
00:00:30.72 --> 00:00:38.68 the back of the hand like an arm wrestling contest, a handshake of brotherhood.
00:00:38.68 --> 00:00:41.72 The young seal was feeling the morphine.
00:00:41.72 --> 00:00:45.20 I saw it as eyes, but he was still there.
00:00:45.20 --> 00:00:48.68 Still conscious and aware.
00:00:48.68 --> 00:00:58.20 He was everything a young man should be smart, brave, athletic, funny, loyal and tough.
00:00:58.20 --> 00:01:03.16 He had been shot in the leg about a half an hour before.
00:01:03.16 --> 00:01:08.64 I found out later that Mikey Montsour, a young seal machine gunner, had run out into heavy
00:01:08.64 --> 00:01:14.84 enemy gunfire and drag this seal out of a war torn street in the Malab district in the city
00:01:14.84 --> 00:01:20.96 of Ramadi, the violent heart of the insurgency in Iraq.
00:01:20.96 --> 00:01:27.52 The wounded seal now lay on a gurney and Charlie Medd, the camp Ramadi field hospital
00:01:27.52 --> 00:01:32.52 where US military surgical teams worked furiously to save the lives of gravely wounded
00:01:32.52 --> 00:01:36.76 troops almost every day.
00:01:36.76 --> 00:01:45.36 The bullet, a mammoth armor piercing 7.62 by 54 millimeter round with a steel core, had entered
00:01:45.36 --> 00:01:51.32 his leg at the lower thigh, ripped the part flesh and bone inside his leg and exited in
00:01:51.32 --> 00:01:56.72 his upper thigh close to the groin.
00:01:56.72 --> 00:02:02.48 It was hard to say if he would keep his leg from the looks of the wound.
00:02:02.48 --> 00:02:05.88 My guess was no.
00:02:05.88 --> 00:02:09.60 He would lose it.
00:02:09.60 --> 00:02:15.68 The wounded seals grip on my hand tightened and he pulled me in, drawing me just inches
00:02:15.68 --> 00:02:18.20 from his face.
00:02:18.20 --> 00:02:24.04 I could tell he wanted to say something to me so I turned and put my ear to his next to his
00:02:24.04 --> 00:02:26.40 mouth.
00:02:26.40 --> 00:02:30.16 I wasn't sure what to expect.
00:02:30.16 --> 00:02:35.48 Was he scared or angry or depressed that he might lose his leg?
00:02:35.48 --> 00:02:37.88 Was he nervous about what might happen next?
00:02:37.88 --> 00:02:42.12 Was he confused?
00:02:42.12 --> 00:02:50.40 He took a breath and then whispered, sir, let me stay.
00:02:50.40 --> 00:02:51.40 Let me stay.
00:02:51.40 --> 00:02:53.16 Please don't make me go home.
00:02:53.16 --> 00:02:54.16 I'll do anything.
00:02:54.16 --> 00:02:55.72 I'll sweep up around the camp.
00:02:55.72 --> 00:02:57.04 I can heal here.
00:02:57.04 --> 00:02:58.04 Please.
00:02:58.04 --> 00:02:59.04 Please.
00:02:59.04 --> 00:03:04.72 Please stay with the task unit.
00:03:04.72 --> 00:03:07.52 There you go.
00:03:07.52 --> 00:03:15.08 Not scared, not angry, not depressed that he might lose his leg.
00:03:15.08 --> 00:03:21.40 Only concerned that he might have to leave our task unit.
00:03:21.40 --> 00:03:23.72 Task unit bruiser.
00:03:23.72 --> 00:03:25.32 Our task unit.
00:03:25.32 --> 00:03:28.16 Our lives.
00:03:28.16 --> 00:03:33.08 This seal was our first significant casualty.
00:03:33.08 --> 00:03:36.84 We had had guys catch some frag on previous operations.
00:03:36.84 --> 00:03:40.40 We had had some very close calls.
00:03:40.40 --> 00:03:45.44 This was the first seal wounded from task unit bruiser whose life would be forever changed
00:03:45.44 --> 00:03:49.92 by a grave combat injury.
00:03:49.92 --> 00:03:54.16 Even if he kept his leg, the damage was so substantial that it didn't seem possible
00:03:54.16 --> 00:04:02.64 he would ever fully regain the extraordinary athleticism he had displayed previously.
00:04:02.64 --> 00:04:07.28 And yet this seal was only concerned that he would let me down.
00:04:07.28 --> 00:04:16.60 Let the task unit down, let his platoon and his team down.
00:04:16.60 --> 00:04:20.48 This was a man.
00:04:20.48 --> 00:04:26.08 This was a true friend of brother.
00:04:26.08 --> 00:04:29.000 This was a hero.
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:41.88 Young, brave, and without question, more concerned for his friends than for his own life.
00:04:41.88 --> 00:04:45.12 I was moved.
00:04:45.12 --> 00:04:47.88 I felt tears wailing up in my eyes.
00:04:47.88 --> 00:04:55.16 I fought them back, then I swallowed the lump in my throat.
00:04:55.16 --> 00:04:59.64 This was no time to break down.
00:04:59.64 --> 00:05:05.20 I was supposed to be the leader.
00:05:05.20 --> 00:05:15.24 And he needed me to be strong.
00:05:15.24 --> 00:05:26.08 And that right there is from the opening chapter of a book called The Dicotomy of Leadership,
00:05:26.08 --> 00:05:28.92 which is actually a new book.
00:05:28.92 --> 00:05:38.08 And it was written by me and my brother, Lave Babin, and Lave has been on this podcast
00:05:38.08 --> 00:05:39.24 before.
00:05:39.24 --> 00:05:41.56 We wrote extreme ownership together.
00:05:41.56 --> 00:05:46.96 We obviously served in task unit, bruiser together.
00:05:46.96 --> 00:05:49.24 And he was on this podcast.
00:05:49.24 --> 00:05:50.80 He was the first guest.
00:05:50.80 --> 00:05:54.96 He's been the guest the most times.
00:05:54.96 --> 00:05:55.96 He was on 11.
00:05:55.96 --> 00:05:58.80 He was on 34, 65, and 11, 14.
00:05:58.80 --> 00:06:05.44 If you want to go get some background on Lave, but I'm glad to say that he is actually back
00:06:05.44 --> 00:06:07.44 here with us again.
00:06:07.44 --> 00:06:09.72 It's a Lave Babin.
00:06:09.72 --> 00:06:10.72 Welcome back.
00:06:10.72 --> 00:06:11.72 It's going to be back.
00:06:11.72 --> 00:06:13.20 Thanks for having me on.
00:06:13.20 --> 00:06:14.72 Yeah, right home, man.
00:06:14.72 --> 00:06:21.24 And it's good to have you back because we're done writing and editing this book, which
00:06:21.24 --> 00:06:22.24 feels good.
00:06:22.24 --> 00:06:23.24 It does feel good.
00:06:23.24 --> 00:06:27.04 It's been a lot of work, but it's been awesome, too.
00:06:27.04 --> 00:06:29.64 And to be able to tell this kind of stories, I can just read.
00:06:29.64 --> 00:06:35.80 And even though I've read that now a hundred times, it just takes me immediately back
00:06:35.80 --> 00:06:38.36 to that situation.
00:06:38.36 --> 00:06:41.60 And it's just extraordinary.
00:06:41.60 --> 00:06:45.88 We were able to work with some incredible, incredible seals like that young man.
00:06:45.88 --> 00:06:49.60 Yeah, no doubt about it.
00:06:49.60 --> 00:06:52.84 It's weird when you're writing a book.
00:06:52.84 --> 00:06:55.28 And then you're rereading it and rereading it.
00:06:55.28 --> 00:07:02.56 And like you said, every time I would be reading these sections, you just get that, you
00:07:02.56 --> 00:07:04.36 just can't help but go back there.
00:07:04.36 --> 00:07:05.68 You just can't help but go back there.
00:07:05.68 --> 00:07:07.88 And this was definitely there were some parts of this book.
00:07:07.88 --> 00:07:14.40 And I was writing that were definitely hard to write and even hard to edit.
00:07:14.40 --> 00:07:16.72 You know, this, this being wonderful.
00:07:16.72 --> 00:07:22.28 And I'm glad that we're able to share the stories of guys like that.
00:07:22.28 --> 00:07:28.12 And that particular individual, which I don't talk about this in the book, but he kept
00:07:28.12 --> 00:07:30.04 his leg, thank God.
00:07:30.04 --> 00:07:37.84 And he kept getting after it for years and years.
00:07:37.84 --> 00:07:41.44 And he kept training Jiu Jitsu and he's a total stud maybe sometime.
00:07:41.44 --> 00:07:43.68 He'll come on the podcast, who knows?
00:07:43.68 --> 00:07:46.68 But what a great guy.
00:07:46.68 --> 00:07:56.08 Now you also kind of kicked off the book with what I thought was a solid way to kick it off.
00:07:56.08 --> 00:07:58.08 And you should go into that.
00:07:58.08 --> 00:08:02.24 I know we were trying to pick out some good sections here, but I thought the opener that
00:08:02.24 --> 00:08:06.92 you put in, which you opened with the phrase that we've been using quite a bit lately.
00:08:06.92 --> 00:08:16.40 But kick off that introduction to the book, dichotomy leadership.
00:08:16.40 --> 00:08:17.68 Stand by to get some.
00:08:17.68 --> 00:08:22.08 Said someone over the inner squad radio and the calm demeanor, you might expect a
00:08:22.08 --> 00:08:27.48 bit of a flight attendant telling airline passengers to stow their tray tables for landing.
00:08:27.48 --> 00:08:30.32 The street and front of us had emptied of people.
00:08:30.32 --> 00:08:34.16 Like magic, the local citizens had all suddenly disappeared.
00:08:34.16 --> 00:08:35.88 And we knew what that meant.
00:08:35.88 --> 00:08:38.16 Enemy attack was imminent.
00:08:38.16 --> 00:08:42.04 The hair on the back of my neck stood at rigid attention.
00:08:42.04 --> 00:08:46.72 After many eviscious gunfighting Romadi, standby to get some was a running joke that
00:08:46.72 --> 00:08:49.96 eased attention right when we knew trouble was coming.
00:08:49.96 --> 00:08:54.60 The more nonchalantly it could be said, under the diarist of circumstances, the funnier
00:08:54.60 --> 00:08:56.56 it was.
00:08:56.56 --> 00:09:01.000 It was broad daylight as our patrol of seals and Iraqi soldiers made its way on foot
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.56 down the narrow city street, bordered by high concrete walls on both sides.
00:09:06.56 --> 00:09:09.32 Suddenly the world exploded.
00:09:09.32 --> 00:09:14.24 Dozens of bullets snap to the air, each with a sharp, supersonic crack, and smashed into
00:09:14.24 --> 00:09:17.72 the concrete wall next to me with thunderous impact.
00:09:17.72 --> 00:09:20.000 The yards of concrete flew everywhere.
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.84 The heavy valleys of incoming fire sounded like multiple jack-hammers simultaneously
00:09:24.84 --> 00:09:28.84 chewing up the street and the walls all around us.
00:09:28.84 --> 00:09:32.12 We had walked right into an enemy bus saw.
00:09:32.12 --> 00:09:35.96 In surgeon fighters hit us from multiple directions with belt fed machine guns.
00:09:35.96 --> 00:09:38.64 I couldn't see them or where they were shooting from.
00:09:38.64 --> 00:09:44.28 But the number of enemy bullets flying to the air around us was crazy.
00:09:44.28 --> 00:09:48.68 There was no place to hide, with high walls on both sides, the narrow south center of
00:09:48.68 --> 00:09:51.20 a mighty street provided no cover.
00:09:51.20 --> 00:09:55.72 The only thing between us and the enemy machine guns was a single parked car on the
00:09:55.72 --> 00:10:01.04 side of the road some distance up the block and the typical trash thrown about.
00:10:01.04 --> 00:10:03.56 The patrol was in a dual column formation.
00:10:03.56 --> 00:10:08.04 Each column split on opposite sides of the street, hookered close to the walls.
00:10:08.04 --> 00:10:11.12 There was nothing to get behind that could protect us from bullets.
00:10:11.12 --> 00:10:15.76 But we did have something on our side, devastating firepower.
00:10:15.76 --> 00:10:20.04 We fully expected a firefighter on every patrol into this enemy hill neighborhood and
00:10:20.04 --> 00:10:21.76 we rolled in heavy.
00:10:21.76 --> 00:10:26.72 Each squad of eight seals packed at least four belt fed machine guns to suppress any enemy
00:10:26.72 --> 00:10:28.64 attack we encountered.
00:10:28.64 --> 00:10:33.52 When we came under fire, our immediate response with violent and overwhelming gunfire provided
00:10:33.52 --> 00:10:35.04 the only answer.
00:10:35.04 --> 00:10:36.96 Cover and move.
00:10:36.96 --> 00:10:40.72 Having learned through the humbling experience of months of urban combat, task unit
00:10:40.72 --> 00:10:45.28 rooser had had plenty of practice in this fundamental gun fighting principle.
00:10:45.28 --> 00:10:50.40 Within nanoseconds, the seals with a big machine guns up front, unleash the most ruthless
00:10:50.40 --> 00:10:53.44 and lethal barrage of fire you can imagine.
00:10:53.44 --> 00:11:01.24 Despite the intensity and violence of the closer urban combat, I couldn't help but smile.
00:11:01.24 --> 00:11:02.24 Couldn't help but smile.
00:11:02.24 --> 00:11:06.56 Yeah, that's we've said this before, but obviously guys that have been too war usually
00:11:06.56 --> 00:11:09.64 that's the best thing in their life and the best experiences they've found in their lives
00:11:09.64 --> 00:11:15.96 and it gives you that type of feeling right there of where you can't help but smile.
00:11:15.96 --> 00:11:20.04 Then as I just talked about it and as we both know, it's also the worst days of our lives
00:11:20.04 --> 00:11:26.80 are also there and we know that people in the military all feel most of them feel the same
00:11:26.80 --> 00:11:33.16 way that you have your best days and your worst days there.
00:11:33.16 --> 00:11:36.32 It's interesting.
00:11:36.32 --> 00:11:41.72 Over and move, it always comes back to cover and move in these gun fights and you know
00:11:41.72 --> 00:11:46.92 a client we were working with recently and you know remember he switched around, cover
00:11:46.92 --> 00:11:53.04 and move and made it a second and put simple first and it's like well there's a reason
00:11:53.04 --> 00:11:57.000 why that exists that way cover move is first because if you're not working together
00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.88 there's a team there's nothing to even keep simple.
00:11:59.88 --> 00:12:00.88 That's not happening.
00:12:00.88 --> 00:12:07.76 You need to start off with cover move teamwork is critical and obviously we just read a
00:12:07.76 --> 00:12:13.44 couple of sort of war story-ish type things but like extreme ownership this book's kind
00:12:13.44 --> 00:12:15.000 of set up the same way as extreme ownership.
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.68 I mean, oh, not kind of it is set up the same way as extreme ownership which is a story
00:12:21.68 --> 00:12:29.32 about combat that reveals a principle and then actually state what the principle is and
00:12:29.32 --> 00:12:36.56 then we use a business example that shows how this principle applies in civilian life and
00:12:36.56 --> 00:12:37.56 usually in the business world.
00:12:37.56 --> 00:12:42.24 In fact, always in the business world that's those examples that we use although we could
00:12:42.24 --> 00:12:48.44 probably do another book that was about how these principles apply to your under nine
00:12:48.44 --> 00:12:55.88 year old soccer team or your relationship with your spouse or your relationship with your
00:12:55.88 --> 00:13:02.68 teenage daughters to of them or your relationship with your teenage son or one of them
00:13:02.68 --> 00:13:07.24 or your relationship with your nine year old daughter or your what do you got three
00:13:07.24 --> 00:13:09.08 and four and three and a two year old.
00:13:09.08 --> 00:13:10.52 Yeah, get some absolutely.
00:13:10.52 --> 00:13:13.28 It could absolutely apply to any of those situations.
00:13:13.28 --> 00:13:18.68 I think that was that was was amazing about extreme ownership to see how people apply
00:13:18.68 --> 00:13:22.96 that in so many aspects of their lives and now I think with the economy leadership it's
00:13:22.96 --> 00:13:23.96 exactly the same thing.
00:13:23.96 --> 00:13:24.96 Yeah.
00:13:24.96 --> 00:13:28.04 And it applies across all aspects of a professional and personal life.
00:13:28.04 --> 00:13:31.64 Well, it was your two because when when you know when I got out of the teams like I
00:13:31.64 --> 00:13:36.16 didn't understand I didn't understand the broad application of what we knew.
00:13:36.16 --> 00:13:39.40 I didn't I mean when I started working with civilian companies then it's like oh well this
00:13:39.40 --> 00:13:42.08 is your problem you don't keep things simple enough or this is your problem you don't
00:13:42.08 --> 00:13:46.40 have decentralized commands so you're trying to control all the decision make it's but as soon
00:13:46.40 --> 00:13:50.32 as we realized and I realized it was like oh it applies to this company what about
00:13:50.32 --> 00:13:53.88 this company and okay what about this company and you just realize okay and that's when
00:13:53.88 --> 00:13:58.52 I started just seeing it everywhere and and I think yeah exactly right the dichotomy
00:13:58.52 --> 00:14:05.76 leadership is the same way and it well like I said it's not just a book of war stories
00:14:05.76 --> 00:14:11.96 the point of the book is to make people better leaders is to give them leadership tools
00:14:11.96 --> 00:14:18.56 including me including you like when you write stuff down you understand it better and
00:14:18.56 --> 00:14:23.12 so you know part of writing these books is like okay how can I capture these lessons
00:14:23.12 --> 00:14:28.28 for myself and of course it's nice that other people can grab them then and look through
00:14:28.28 --> 00:14:32.96 them but like I said it's not it's not just about war stories but to make people better
00:14:32.96 --> 00:14:38.92 leaders and I think I think we covered that pretty well in sort of in the intro of the
00:14:38.92 --> 00:14:44.32 book and just a couple paragraphs and you should hit that part that we talked about earlier
00:14:44.32 --> 00:14:50.96 where it just kind of gives the overall the overall view or the the high level view of the
00:14:50.96 --> 00:14:55.92 topic of the book every behavior or characteristic carried out by a leader can be taken
00:14:55.92 --> 00:15:01.68 too far leaders can become too extreme and upset the balance required to effectively lead
00:15:01.68 --> 00:15:07.68 a team when balance is lost leadership suffers and the teens performance rapidly declines
00:15:07.68 --> 00:15:13.04 even the fundamental principles of combat leadership and extreme ownership can get out
00:15:13.04 --> 00:15:18.32 of balance a leader can cover and move too much and step on the toes of other leaders
00:15:18.32 --> 00:15:22.96 departments or divisions a plan can be too simple and failed to cover likely
00:15:22.96 --> 00:15:28.000 the contingencies a team could go too far with prioritizing execute resulting in target
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.12 fixation and loss of situational awareness on newly emerging problems and threats even
00:15:34.12 --> 00:15:38.84 destabilize command can be taken too far when too much autonomy is given to support
00:15:38.84 --> 00:15:43.84 leaders who then don't fully understand strategic goals and how to execute and support
00:15:43.84 --> 00:15:49.44 those goals and this idea continues on but just about everything a leader does leaders must
00:15:49.44 --> 00:15:53.92 be close with their people but not too close that it becomes a problem they must hold
00:15:53.92 --> 00:15:59.28 the line with discipline but they must not become tyrannical a leader can even become too
00:15:59.28 --> 00:16:04.40 extreme with extreme ownership when a leader takes so much ownership of everything in his
00:16:04.40 --> 00:16:08.40 or her world that members of the team feel there's nothing left for which they can take
00:16:08.40 --> 00:16:14.56 ownership when this happens team members will execute only at the boss's specific direction
00:16:14.56 --> 00:16:20.000 without any route ownership or buy in themselves resulting in a team far less capable
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.76 of overcoming obstacles and accomplish in the mission therefore balance and leadership
00:16:25.76 --> 00:16:32.08 is crucial to victory you can't say that one enough and you literally can't say that one
00:16:32.08 --> 00:16:38.88 enough I would think so when you have the same word to many time on times on a page it's
00:16:38.88 --> 00:16:43.52 it's not good writing right it's not good use the same word over and over again so
00:16:43.52 --> 00:16:47.76 I remember there was times where we would have the word balance like nine times in a paragraph
00:16:47.76 --> 00:16:51.76 but there's it's like hey there's no real other way to say what we're trying to say you got
00:16:51.76 --> 00:16:56.48 a balance these things and it's interesting too as as as you're reading that I'm just thinking
00:16:56.48 --> 00:17:01.68 of all the different situations we've been in in the last few years with echelon front
00:17:01.68 --> 00:17:07.28 where we've seen every single one of these things you know the person that comes up
00:17:07.28 --> 00:17:11.04 hey we want to keep this plan simple and then they don't think of any contingencies or hey
00:17:11.04 --> 00:17:14.16 I'm just trying to cover and move and that means I'm going to do the job for them and
00:17:14.16 --> 00:17:17.92 all of a sudden they're making everyone mad because they're stepping on everyone toes I mean
00:17:17.92 --> 00:17:22.000 decentralized command we're no one knows what's going on because it's okay I'm our hands off
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000 leader I'm using decentralized command but boss what in God's name you actually want us to do
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.72 so all these things are we've lived we've lived film now and it became really evident
00:17:34.72 --> 00:17:38.16 even though we have you know it's the last chapter the last chapter in extreme ownership is the
00:17:38.16 --> 00:17:43.44 dichotomy leadership and discipline equals freedom and you know we put it in there because we knew
00:17:43.44 --> 00:17:49.52 it was important but now after working with more people over the past few years it's become so obvious
00:17:49.52 --> 00:17:55.04 that this is like such a critical the being able to balance balance balance balance I
00:17:55.04 --> 00:18:00.48 use that word nine times in every paragraph because that's what you have to do if you're a leader
00:18:00.48 --> 00:18:06.000 and and we talk about this too and the opening of in the opening of the book and you know in
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.76 the opening of dichotomy leadership we talk about how one of the problems with the book
00:18:11.76 --> 00:18:16.64 extreme ownership is the title extreme ownership because it made everyone just want to get
00:18:16.64 --> 00:18:21.60 extraordinary with everything I'm going to be super extreme and so that means you know what I'm
00:18:21.60 --> 00:18:25.84 going to do but get extreme on our own everything and we that was one of the earliest things that I
00:18:25.84 --> 00:18:30.80 started noticing was people that took so much ownership so on the leader I'm in charge and I take
00:18:30.80 --> 00:18:35.04 so much ownership of everything that everyone below me in the chain of command there's nothing
00:18:35.04 --> 00:18:38.72 left for them to own and and all of a sudden they're just feeling like hey they're just along
00:18:38.72 --> 00:18:42.24 for the ride and they're just going to do what they're told to do and all their initiatives gone and
00:18:42.24 --> 00:18:47.28 they don't they don't even have they don't they don't it's not that they don't believe but they
00:18:47.28 --> 00:18:51.28 just think okay well it's going to do it what we're told so it's not their plan and so they're going
00:18:51.28 --> 00:18:56.16 to do the best their ability but it's not theirs they don't own it so all those things that you
00:18:56.16 --> 00:19:01.84 just talked about are our things that we've we've now seen and there are things that I struggle with
00:19:01.84 --> 00:19:04.80 you know I think there's there are things that you struggle I think we each of us struggle with them
00:19:04.80 --> 00:19:09.28 it's the hardest part about leadership and as we've seen that over and over again that you know
00:19:09.28 --> 00:19:15.36 that brief introduction that we gave it in chapter 12 of extreme ownership you know introduce the
00:19:15.36 --> 00:19:20.000 concept but this dives so much deeper into those challenges and I think that's what what I
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.16 know about this book is it answers the the questions to that that we get most often about
00:19:26.16 --> 00:19:31.28 about how to balance that because that's the hardest part and it's so difficult to do and I
00:19:31.28 --> 00:19:35.84 remember it our first master there was a question about you know can you take you know can
00:19:35.84 --> 00:19:40.16 extreme ownership go too far I actually answer the question well I think if you're properly
00:19:40.16 --> 00:19:45.68 understanding what extreme ownership means no but you actually answer that as I was like yes
00:19:45.68 --> 00:19:50.16 you can take too much ownership and I think that's what people take that is well I've got to do
00:19:50.16 --> 00:19:54.40 everything like no you you're responsible for everything that's what extreme ownership means but
00:19:54.40 --> 00:19:58.32 certainly you can you can absolutely take too much ownership where no one's doing anything and I
00:19:58.32 --> 00:20:03.36 think we explained that pretty well in this book and this this book was written just like
00:20:03.36 --> 00:20:08.32 extreme ownership that economy leadership was written to help leaders as a reference manual and
00:20:08.32 --> 00:20:13.20 and if it's something that you know if I see pages like we see so many cops of extreme ownership
00:20:13.20 --> 00:20:16.64 I mean I want to see pages that are underlined that are highlighted they're tab that are
00:20:16.64 --> 00:20:21.60 they're utilized by leaders and and if we've done that and this is a manual that helps
00:20:22.08 --> 00:20:26.64 leaders lead better and be better people and lead better teams that then this will have
00:20:26.64 --> 00:20:30.96 a accomplishes mission you know what's cool is is I think it's very similar to the fact that
00:20:30.96 --> 00:20:36.40 with extreme ownership right with that attitude with that attitude when you get in that mindset
00:20:36.40 --> 00:20:42.08 you start seeing it everywhere and you start when someone makes an excuse you recognize
00:20:42.08 --> 00:20:47.68 me that you go that's an excuse like echo is giving you a hard time about your your lack of a
00:20:47.68 --> 00:20:53.92 haircut and and you know you were you were saying that I was my fault and we're laughing about it right
00:20:54.32 --> 00:20:58.80 and and of course I was I was like well you know I should have told you you know there's
00:20:58.80 --> 00:21:03.20 gonna be a timeline and you need to get haircut before but you know we're joking about it but
00:21:03.20 --> 00:21:08.24 in the same time that we're joking about it the fact that like you brought that echo that up
00:21:08.24 --> 00:21:12.88 is a real thing and for us to be sitting here joking about it means that we actually think about it
00:21:12.88 --> 00:21:18.96 we actually every time you know you know laves making it a joke and excuse like oh juggling he's
00:21:18.96 --> 00:21:25.60 it's like we all know and it's it's it's a it's a it's syncs in and it becomes really like for
00:21:25.60 --> 00:21:32.80 someone to make an actual excuse becomes really really hard and I think for me that's one thing that
00:21:32.80 --> 00:21:38.88 I've benefited over the last few years of seeing other people what you it's it becomes when you're
00:21:38.88 --> 00:21:43.68 aware of it when you're aware of it the balance becomes much much easier to see and that's what
00:21:43.68 --> 00:21:47.84 I think is gonna be very helpful about this book is people won't know that they're out of balance
00:21:47.84 --> 00:21:51.84 that's the biggest problem a big problem is they don't know they're thinking my my guys are
00:21:51.84 --> 00:21:55.92 taking any initiative what's wrong with them and it's like well your micro managing them you've
00:21:55.92 --> 00:22:00.40 gone too far in that direction you've gone too far in controlling everything that they do they think
00:22:00.40 --> 00:22:04.32 that that's they think that if you want them to do something that you're gonna tell them to do it
00:22:04.32 --> 00:22:08.16 and other than that they're gonna sit there and stand by a wait for orders and it's like no
00:22:08.80 --> 00:22:14.08 so and you if you don't understand that you can be out of balance then you won't recognize that
00:22:14.08 --> 00:22:19.44 but if you know hey my guys aren't taking in any initiative I wonder what's wrong with them
00:22:20.56 --> 00:22:25.76 well actually maybe it's me maybe it's me and maybe I am micro managing them so much
00:22:25.76 --> 00:22:31.12 that I've beaten the initiative out of them so what I need to do is back off a little bit and
00:22:31.12 --> 00:22:35.44 we'll give them some leeway and give them some ownership of what they're doing and let them
00:22:35.44 --> 00:22:39.44 make some decisions down there and if if you do that then you start seeing it come back and you
00:22:39.44 --> 00:22:43.12 start seeing them take initiative and you feel good and that's a you know one of the chapters in
00:22:43.12 --> 00:22:48.08 the book is actually that right there where I talk about my first deployment to Iraq where I first
00:22:48.08 --> 00:22:54.72 got to Iraq my first time in combat I was just basically wanted to own everything because that was
00:22:54.72 --> 00:22:58.16 my last my personal idea I come to take ownership of this and then I realized my guys
00:22:58.16 --> 00:23:01.36 I'm not gonna all the you know they're not really taking the initiative I wanted to take
00:23:01.36 --> 00:23:07.52 well why is that it's because I'm micro managing them and finally luckily we got over a
00:23:07.52 --> 00:23:12.64 wound with operations we had so many operations to conduct and I was like I can't manage all these
00:23:12.64 --> 00:23:17.92 I can't oversee everything that's happening and I had to cut the guys loose and as soon as I
00:23:17.92 --> 00:23:21.28 caught a loose and said hey you got this and you got that and you got the other thing the guys
00:23:21.28 --> 00:23:25.44 just started stepping up and running everything like I knew like like of course they could because
00:23:25.44 --> 00:23:30.48 they're freaking highly capable guys and they started kicking ass and I realized like oh I don't
00:23:30.48 --> 00:23:34.88 even barely even need to be here right barely even need to be here whereas in the beginning I
00:23:34.88 --> 00:23:39.60 thought oh this is all I'll if I wasn't for me you know and I'm only talking about a period of a
00:23:39.60 --> 00:23:44.24 few weeks of me trying to micro manage everything so I think what's gonna be beneficial about this
00:23:44.24 --> 00:23:50.88 book is that people will see how they can get out of balance and and they'll also see that that
00:23:50.88 --> 00:23:58.48 balance pertains to just about everything and every trait that you have that's positive as a
00:23:58.48 --> 00:24:03.76 leader you can overdue and you can turn it into a negative trait if you go too far
00:24:05.52 --> 00:24:09.52 see you're going to watch out for that you can definitely got to watch out for that it's easy
00:24:09.52 --> 00:24:14.08 for us to see you know we always talk about the attachment attachment so important and for us with you
00:24:14.08 --> 00:24:17.12 know throughout coming to Ashland front it's worth working with these leaders and working with these
00:24:17.12 --> 00:24:23.76 companies you you can see it you know it just it just stands out so obvious that someone is you know
00:24:23.76 --> 00:24:27.20 they're trying to cover move by helping another department and yet they're stepping on people's
00:24:27.20 --> 00:24:31.60 toes and they're pissing people off and you know like why are you you're trying to do my job and make
00:24:31.60 --> 00:24:35.92 me look bad and they get there like well I'm trying to cover move just like you don't me
00:24:35.92 --> 00:24:40.08 I'm just trying to help you and then you're saying well you have to be careful about that you have to
00:24:40.08 --> 00:24:45.52 balance it so once you know it is the absolute most common problem we see all the time and even
00:24:45.52 --> 00:24:50.16 for you know folks that have read extreme ownership you know three or four you know multiple times
00:24:50.16 --> 00:24:54.48 that that are really trying hard to be better leaders they struggle with that and this is
00:24:55.20 --> 00:25:00.24 something to help them and help leaders everywhere and you know and we wrote the book too so that
00:25:00.24 --> 00:25:06.08 it could be read it's a follow on certainly a sequel you gave me a chance to correct that
00:25:06.08 --> 00:25:10.24 yeah why would you say what do you say on the you were talking about jaws to your dog
00:25:10.24 --> 00:25:15.52 yeah podcast one fourteen and I said it's not a sequel it's a standalone book but it absolutely
00:25:15.52 --> 00:25:20.80 is a sequel I'm a follow on book it expands on the concepts however we did write it so that that it
00:25:20.80 --> 00:25:25.20 is a standalone book and you can read you can read you can read if you have if you can read
00:25:25.20 --> 00:25:29.52 dichotomy without having red extreme ownership you'll certainly understand it and be able to
00:25:29.52 --> 00:25:36.96 play yeah but you'd understand the concepts better if you read extreme ownership first no question
00:25:36.96 --> 00:25:43.76 and then you jump into dichotomy which yeah like you said can you read it alone sure you can
00:25:43.76 --> 00:25:49.20 I guess there's echo we need like some kind of a movie reference here like yeah I'm thinking
00:25:49.20 --> 00:25:56.40 term could you see Terminator two yes on its own right but you will you will get more out of it
00:25:56.40 --> 00:26:01.04 if you saw Terminator one first yeah correct same with around see look at me just nailing
00:26:01.04 --> 00:26:06.24 the right year nailing yeah so rambo right first blood part two same deal where you could watch
00:26:06.24 --> 00:26:11.92 just rambo and be pretty pretty happy about it hold on now my problem with that is we know that
00:26:11.92 --> 00:26:19.44 Terminator two is equivalent in quality to Terminator one correct correct correct yeah right
00:26:19.44 --> 00:26:27.04 may I think so okay two is awesome except are we saying that we say that Rambo two which I don't
00:26:27.04 --> 00:26:31.84 even think I've seen first blood part two yeah I don't is are we saying that's the same level of
00:26:31.84 --> 00:26:36.80 quality is Rambo for one you get to be careful there that's what I think we're actually
00:26:36.80 --> 00:26:43.36 I mean I'm not saying that's really jaws two which jaws one which is a masterpiece right
00:26:43.36 --> 00:26:49.84 masterpiece jaws jaws one jaws time called jaws one she's called jaws right jaws two
00:26:49.84 --> 00:26:56.16 problematic we got issues so what I'm saying is we're more like the Terminator scenario
00:26:56.16 --> 00:27:00.96 got you or aliens I was gonna say aliens is an aliens right you can totally watch that movie
00:27:00.96 --> 00:27:04.96 stand alone but obviously gives you some more context if you watch the first one but I think the
00:27:04.96 --> 00:27:09.76 second one's actually better yeah then the first one do you feel like do you feel like dichotomies better
00:27:09.76 --> 00:27:16.16 I actually do I actually do feel I feel it's better I mean I'm interested to hear what readers think
00:27:16.16 --> 00:27:23.52 about it but I I think that it's more useful and applicable to to leaders I mean we have three
00:27:23.52 --> 00:27:31.12 years additional leadership experience and not only evaluating our experiences in combat and in
00:27:31.12 --> 00:27:37.60 the seal teens but but now working with hundreds of leaders and I mean really we're talking
00:27:37.60 --> 00:27:42.000 in you know a couple a hundred plus companies that we've worked with in that time
00:27:43.12 --> 00:27:46.64 easily you know between just you mean you probably not that's not even counting some of the other
00:27:46.64 --> 00:27:52.96 members of our team so we've seen this in in a whole lot of different scenarios and I think
00:27:52.96 --> 00:27:58.56 it really addresses the it's a direct application to the problems that we see so I'm pretty all
00:27:58.56 --> 00:28:02.64 for one I'm looking forward to to readers feedback on was it easier for you to write
00:28:02.64 --> 00:28:10.96 yes yeah I mean for me it definitely was and I say easier just because we we well we became
00:28:10.96 --> 00:28:17.04 better writers as we wrote extreme ownership extreme ownership the first version that we did
00:28:17.04 --> 00:28:23.60 extreme ownership was in the third person and I forget why we even did that but we was about
00:28:23.60 --> 00:28:29.68 these two guys named life in jacco it was about I think I kind of forget I think it was a recommendation
00:28:29.68 --> 00:28:34.32 that came to us from the literature the publisher whatever and we know then we finally had to say
00:28:34.32 --> 00:28:38.88 yeah we're not doing that yeah you know that friend of yours that talks about themselves
00:28:38.88 --> 00:28:44.08 in the third person that you make fun of yeah we're not going to do that yeah so and it's weird
00:28:44.08 --> 00:28:49.20 because there's the book there's there's a couple books I've done in the podcast clay pages
00:28:49.20 --> 00:28:54.40 is the St. Lowe by Glover Johns who's the guy for that you know hack worth wrote about
00:28:54.40 --> 00:28:59.76 he wrote the book clay pages that clay pages as they say Lowe and it's in the third person
00:28:59.76 --> 00:29:05.36 about a guy named major johns and it's him and he writes a thing in the beginning and says hey
00:29:05.36 --> 00:29:09.28 I didn't feel comfortable talking about myself so I did a wrote it this way it's like okay
00:29:09.28 --> 00:29:13.36 and the the only thing I would say that's cool about it you could you could kind of give an outside
00:29:13.36 --> 00:29:18.64 view but the thing that's not cool about it is you couldn't be I was thinking this right now which is
00:29:18.64 --> 00:29:23.76 kind of what I want to hear and that's why I normally cover books that are first person
00:29:23.76 --> 00:29:28.08 people that actually experience it but he's a guy that did a couple other people I've
00:29:28.08 --> 00:29:33.44 when you're when you're Glover Johns though and you're your David Hackworth CDADD you can
00:29:33.44 --> 00:29:39.52 know you can do whatever you want to do it you want for sure now that's another part that's
00:29:40.24 --> 00:29:48.24 again you know we've we've in this book we set it up the same way with combat story principle
00:29:48.24 --> 00:29:55.76 followed by a business example but one thing that I think and this is feedback that that we both
00:29:55.76 --> 00:30:02.40 got that I certainly got was that for what for because the consequences are so high in combat it
00:30:02.40 --> 00:30:09.12 makes the principle very clear and even though people might know well I've never been in combat
00:30:09.12 --> 00:30:14.96 but they understand that if we're not working together as a team doing cover move we will die
00:30:14.96 --> 00:30:20.08 and so when they understand that they go okay now that means if I'm not working with the other
00:30:20.08 --> 00:30:24.16 department then we're gonna lose money or we're not gonna complete our mission or we're not
00:30:24.16 --> 00:30:30.72 gonna take market share yes so I think one of the strongest points of of extreme ownership that we
00:30:30.72 --> 00:30:39.12 did again is the combat stories to to sort of introduce the principles and plus it's cool to hear cool
00:30:39.12 --> 00:30:45.68 stories like that but one of them I think chapter three another another one that we pulled out
00:30:45.68 --> 00:30:50.72 that said it'd be good to sort of cover this one real quick is you opened up chapter three
00:30:50.72 --> 00:30:57.12 with a little a little bit of get some I guess we could say and get that one man I want to I want
00:30:57.12 --> 00:31:03.68 to hear that one I want to hear the Texas Batman get crazy in in Ramadi in 2006 this is bringing
00:31:03.68 --> 00:31:10.48 back some awesome memories here bright orange tracer streaked like laser beams just a few feet
00:31:10.48 --> 00:31:16.88 over our heads each supersonic bullet zipping past with a thunderous crack holy shit I thought
00:31:16.88 --> 00:31:22.24 as we quickly duck down behind the roof wall those are friendly shooting at us I looked over at Dave
00:31:22.24 --> 00:31:27.92 Burke who crouched down nearby like the other seals on the roof with us we tried to stay low enough
00:31:27.92 --> 00:31:32.88 not to get our head shot off Dave looked back at me and shook his head with a smile mixed humor
00:31:32.88 --> 00:31:38.48 and concern that's not cool they've said the understatement of the year Dave Burke was a
00:31:38.48 --> 00:31:43.84 US Marine Corps major a fighter pilot by trade he had been the lead instructor at the legendary
00:31:43.84 --> 00:31:49.44 US Navy fighter weapon school better known as top gun Dave had left the cockpit behind a volunteer
00:31:49.44 --> 00:31:54.80 to serve on the ground as a forward air controller in the most dangerous place in Iraq Ramadi
00:31:55.36 --> 00:32:00.88 he led a supporting arms liaison team or salt attached to the US Marine Corps fifth air
00:32:00.88 --> 00:32:06.40 naval gun fire liaison company Dave and his twelve Marines from salt six a company Charlie
00:32:06.40 --> 00:32:11.84 Batoon to coordinate with the aircraft supporting this operation in the skies overhead they patrolled
00:32:11.84 --> 00:32:18.24 him with us on foot to spearhead the operation ahead of the US Army and Iraqi Army units a US tank
00:32:18.24 --> 00:32:24.32 200 yards away had fired a burst from its heavy machine gun directly over our position it was
00:32:24.32 --> 00:32:31.04 friendly fire a blue on blue in US military parlance to be killed or horribly wounded by enemy fire
00:32:31.04 --> 00:32:37.92 was one thing to be killed by our own american forces was something much worse that was way too close
00:32:37.92 --> 00:32:42.64 for comfort I thought in the seconds following as a crouches lowest possible behind the low
00:32:42.64 --> 00:32:48.80 concrete wall that was our only means of cover we had to shut that down immediately and alert the tank
00:32:48.80 --> 00:32:56.000 that we were friendly forces to do so I had to contact the specific tank commander directly via radio
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.40 and tell them to cease fire the tanks heavy machine gun was a 50 caliber M2 Browning
00:33:02.40 --> 00:33:09.20 known as the Maadouce it packed a hell of a punch and US military service since 1933 it
00:33:09.20 --> 00:33:14.72 improvement its deadly effectiveness in every american war since World War I each massive
00:33:14.72 --> 00:33:20.000 round could take a man's head clean off or remove the bulk of his chest cavity it could also
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.28 punch right through concrete walls like the one we were hiding behind we had just received a fully
00:33:25.28 --> 00:33:30.48 automatic burst of probably a dozen rounds in a matter of seconds if I didn't shut down the fire
00:33:30.48 --> 00:33:35.92 immediately and let the US tank know we were friendly it could mean horrible wounds in death for a
00:33:35.92 --> 00:33:44.32 number of us blue on blue it's even an extreme ownership we talked there's three episodes of blue on
00:33:44.32 --> 00:33:51.68 blue potential or blue the app with with Chris potentially shooting the american trooper that was in a
00:33:51.68 --> 00:33:59.84 in a building the Bradley getting ready to light up stoneers guys and also the blue on blue
00:33:59.84 --> 00:34:06.88 that the book starts off with there's it's interesting and a reality of war that we talk about
00:34:06.88 --> 00:34:14.40 blue on blue a lot in that urban environment the other thing I noticed is did I don't mean to
00:34:14.40 --> 00:34:21.12 accuse you here like you know on this in this format but each massive round could take a man's head
00:34:21.12 --> 00:34:26.24 clean off is that not just jacked from clean eastwood right there come on man that's 44
00:34:26.24 --> 00:34:33.04 magnum that's dirty hairy right I can either confirm to that you look at you there's uh
00:34:33.04 --> 00:34:39.68 that did you consult with echo for you know party writing here and the echo echo and I we see
00:34:39.68 --> 00:34:44.08 out of the movie quotes there was a little there was a use of parlance in there too that
00:34:44.08 --> 00:34:49.52 uh in the parlance in the parlance on our times you threw a little little big libowski in there
00:34:50.08 --> 00:34:54.40 that we had previously looked out that was a crazy situation and we were I thought we'd done
00:34:54.40 --> 00:34:59.36 everything what was so crazy about that situation for us is I thought we'd done everything in our
00:34:59.36 --> 00:35:04.96 power to mitigate the risk of that and let everybody know where we were a marked our position you know
00:35:04.96 --> 00:35:11.44 talking coordinate with people and and to still get shot at by friendlies you know they uh
00:35:11.44 --> 00:35:16.64 that was that was crazy David I was looking at you like man this this is good this isn't good at all
00:35:16.64 --> 00:35:21.60 so it was it was a I was a foam of that radio trying to get and and talk to them immediately
00:35:21.60 --> 00:35:27.68 and thank God as we talked about on previous podcasts you'd come down on us to be able to use
00:35:28.80 --> 00:35:32.24 to be able to learn how to use those radios ourselves and not just rely on the radio and
00:35:32.64 --> 00:35:37.84 and I was able to swap over and and make direct cops that take and and get them to cease fire
00:35:38.40 --> 00:35:42.56 and that's one of the things that I like completely held the line on and and you know and you
00:35:42.56 --> 00:35:47.12 talk about in the book how there's some other things where I allowed a little bit of slack and you actually
00:35:47.12 --> 00:35:55.52 you actually kind of capture that in a couple pages later that I pulled up here it's a middle of page
00:35:55.52 --> 00:36:03.28 76 punch through that little section right there and I think it's a it's a good good kind of
00:36:03.28 --> 00:36:07.92 captures what we're talking about in terms of and you were saying this to me early earlier today you're like
00:36:09.04 --> 00:36:13.36 everyone thinks jocca would just be like okay you're gonna shut up do what I tell you to do and it's like
00:36:13.36 --> 00:36:18.72 well actually there's some things I'm gonna tell you that but there's something it's gonna
00:36:18.72 --> 00:36:24.48 there's gonna be a balance well you actually you never said you shut up and do do us do what I tell you to do
00:36:24.48 --> 00:36:30.48 right I'm sure you probably wanted to but many many times yeah and still do I'm I'm sure
00:36:30.48 --> 00:36:36.64 often but there is it's not effective it's never effective to do that and I think so many leaders
00:36:36.64 --> 00:36:40.08 that want to just you know why won't they just do what I tell them to do it's it's people get really
00:36:40.08 --> 00:36:44.48 frustrated by that but obviously there you got to hold a line you absolutely have to hold a line you know
00:36:44.48 --> 00:36:48.56 and if you'd have a linen on us being able to learn how to use a radio I mean that could have
00:36:48.56 --> 00:36:53.36 cost lives right there another verse around comes to the roof wall are we take a main gun
00:36:53.36 --> 00:36:58.80 round now you're talking the the cannon on the tank the 120 millimeter main gun round you know
00:36:58.80 --> 00:37:03.12 just smash through both sides of walls you know it would it would have been absolute catastrophic
00:37:03.12 --> 00:37:06.48 those guys think you know they're under attack they're shooting back at what they think is
00:37:06.48 --> 00:37:11.68 enemy that didn't realize it and it's not like they were they were not ready to use those main
00:37:11.68 --> 00:37:16.16 gun rounds if they had to they were they were putting some buildings down over there for sure
00:37:16.16 --> 00:37:19.60 and that's and that's the hard part right is that you've got to hold a line and there's standards
00:37:19.60 --> 00:37:24.32 that can't be compromised and you've got to you're failing your team and your fan is a leader if you're
00:37:24.32 --> 00:37:31.04 not keeping those standards uh high and making sure the team achieves them and yet also you can't
00:37:31.04 --> 00:37:36.000 be the unrelenting task master the slave driver that just smash his people down is this
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.20 shut up and do it a take yeah this is something that I bring up a lot when I'm working with companies
00:37:39.20 --> 00:37:47.12 is like do you actually want people to do it to do whatever you don't do and the the immediate
00:37:47.12 --> 00:37:50.64 answers like well yeah I just want everyone to shut up and do what I tell them to do well the
00:37:50.64 --> 00:37:56.56 actual answer is no you don't want that if you're a good leader what you want is if I tell
00:37:56.56 --> 00:38:03.28 life hey go take that building over there and you say to me no and I say why not you say well
00:38:03.28 --> 00:38:08.000 there's an idea in the front yard and we'll all get killed if we go there I'm going okay thank you
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.40 now as opposed to you you're you're just going to blindly do whatever I tell you to do well then
00:38:12.40 --> 00:38:17.20 that's going to be problematic so there's a balance in this too and and that's something that we
00:38:17.20 --> 00:38:20.88 talk about all the time but to surround you don't want to surround yourself with the S-men you
00:38:20.88 --> 00:38:26.48 don't want to surround yourself with the S-men and we I've seen plenty of companies where the
00:38:26.48 --> 00:38:31.76 boss man has surrounded himself with the S-men and they yes themselves into the grave because
00:38:31.76 --> 00:38:35.76 there the everyone's just a green oh yep we'll do that that sounds like a great plan boss oh yeah
00:38:35.76 --> 00:38:40.32 yes boss that sounds like a great plan boss and and the next thing you know someone along the
00:38:40.32 --> 00:38:45.36 line should have said hey boss that doesn't make any sense hey boss like oh we got a good
00:38:45.36 --> 00:38:49.68 relationship with these people over here but you know what they're raising their price a little bit
00:38:49.68 --> 00:38:55.76 we don't want to work with them anymore okay well let's think about that you know that that that's
00:38:55.76 --> 00:39:00.48 one of our biggest suppliers do we really want to mix our relationship with our biggest supplier
00:39:00.48 --> 00:39:04.000 does that make sense well you know they're getting in our face now a yes man will be like that's
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.88 right boss we don't take no crap from no one who's through those guys but maybe you want someone
00:39:08.88 --> 00:39:13.36 below you in the chain of commences hey boss let's think about this that's our biggest supplier
00:39:13.36 --> 00:39:18.56 if we cut them off and demand goes up we won't be able to service our customers that could be
00:39:18.56 --> 00:39:24.32 problematic wouldn't you agree how but we negotiate with them so there's my point is you don't just
00:39:24.32 --> 00:39:28.24 want people you don't want to be surrounded by yes man you want people are going to question
00:39:28.24 --> 00:39:32.16 you you want people are going to be that's why like you so much life because you you question
00:39:32.16 --> 00:39:37.12 you you have no problem question you would have said it's all good push you back yeah the
00:39:37.12 --> 00:39:45.76 humble not passive but I I've never never been passive but I think this this here page 76 that's a
00:39:45.76 --> 00:39:51.60 good that's a good little wait a capture what we're talking about as our reflected upon joccos
00:39:51.60 --> 00:39:56.24 demonstration of a leader's responsibility to ensure standards are maintained I thought about
00:39:56.24 --> 00:40:00.56 the times of my career when I failed to do so as a young leader I knew there were times we
00:40:00.56 --> 00:40:05.36 needed to improve our performance do another run to the kill house where we practice close quarters
00:40:05.36 --> 00:40:11.20 combat or add an additional rehearsal to ensure we were fully prepared yet in those moments
00:40:11.20 --> 00:40:16.24 I sometimes hadn't held the line I hadn't pushed the team hard enough any additional work
00:40:16.24 --> 00:40:20.40 assigned to the team was going to get pushback and generate complaints and there were times
00:40:20.40 --> 00:40:26.000 when I let things slide confusing the idea of taking care of your people with allowing them not
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.88 to work as hard but in the end that resulted in mediocre performance and the team never got better
00:40:32.88 --> 00:40:38.64 never held each other accountable this was a failure of leadership my leadership I also
00:40:38.64 --> 00:40:43.92 recognized the dichotomy there were other times when I was overbearing I insisted on doing things
00:40:43.92 --> 00:40:49.12 a certain way because it was my way or harped on trivial matters that were strategically
00:40:49.12 --> 00:40:55.20 unimportant thinking I was doing right by holding the line it caused unnecessary friction
00:40:55.20 --> 00:41:01.44 stifled growth and inhibited junior leaders on the team from stepping up it prevented us from functioning
00:41:01.44 --> 00:41:06.96 properly with effective decentralized command I had seen and worked for numerous leaders throughout my
00:41:06.96 --> 00:41:12.32 navy career who had been overbearing and it wasn't the way I wanted to lead some of them imposed
00:41:12.32 --> 00:41:18.08 harsh discipline screened at their people and crushed them morale of the team no one wanted to follow
00:41:18.08 --> 00:41:24.000 them they might accomplish an immediate task but in the long run the team's growth was smothered
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.68 often their negative example stood starkly in my mind I never want to be a leader like that
00:41:31.92 --> 00:41:38.40 there you go the tyrannical leader that's run around screaming at everyone and and like you just
00:41:38.40 --> 00:41:43.84 said they'll get some little tasks accomplished and they actually think that what's horrible is
00:41:43.84 --> 00:41:48.96 they get some little task accomplished because they screamed in yelled and it reinforces that behavior
00:41:48.96 --> 00:41:53.44 and so they become even more tyrannical and yell and scream even more and they never see the fact
00:41:53.44 --> 00:41:58.64 that acting that way it'll get you a little short term thing done but you'll never get everything
00:41:58.64 --> 00:42:02.72 you can out of people you never get everything you can out of somebody that you've beaten in
00:42:02.72 --> 00:42:07.36 this mission you're they're not going to perform to their fullest potential and capability and
00:42:07.36 --> 00:42:11.20 that's just where you're going to be that's just where you're going to be the other thing
00:42:13.20 --> 00:42:20.40 it takes this is this is one of those things like if you've got something that's hard to do right
00:42:20.40 --> 00:42:26.32 you've got something that the team has gone to do that's hard to do and you're wishy-washy about it
00:42:26.32 --> 00:42:30.80 you know it's the right thing to do but you're wishy-washy about how you approach the team with doing it
00:42:32.72 --> 00:42:36.08 it's not going to happen it's just not going to happen I'm reading another book right now
00:42:36.08 --> 00:42:42.000 by a guy that was in Vietnam with Hacworth and he's saying just he would just lay down the
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.36 law like Hacworth is like no we're doing this this is what we're going to do this is how it's going to be
00:42:45.36 --> 00:42:53.44 and that's that's what it is you know I've got so many examples from my career but I'll tell you
00:42:53.44 --> 00:43:00.48 really kind of a lame one but it's it's worth telling so back good noon dude guess what we used to
00:43:00.48 --> 00:43:04.80 do in the teams we used to drink beer a lot of it and that was kind of like hey you know we're
00:43:04.80 --> 00:43:11.36 we're in the steels you know we're beer drink and frog men and that's cool and I was in a
00:43:11.36 --> 00:43:18.08 seal platoon where we drink a lot even more than a normal seal platoon which is what you
00:43:18.08 --> 00:43:23.04 know what you put you in the running for a lot and this is back in the 90s there's no
00:43:23.04 --> 00:43:28.56 we're going on and I've said this before kind of the way that we proved ourselves because there's
00:43:28.56 --> 00:43:32.32 a certain level of sacrifice you have to make to prove to your teammates that you're like you're
00:43:32.32 --> 00:43:36.80 willing to sacrifice well one of the ways that you can sacrifice is you can just drink a lot
00:43:36.80 --> 00:43:41.76 and prove that you can go all night go hard and still get up the next day and so I was in a
00:43:41.76 --> 00:43:47.44 seal platoon where we drank a lot just about everyone in the chain of command except for the the
00:43:47.44 --> 00:43:53.20 commander the OIC but everyone else you know we drank hard and you know we we've partied in whatever
00:43:54.40 --> 00:44:00.08 and we were a ship board we were an argue platoon so we were deploying on board a ship
00:44:00.08 --> 00:44:08.16 and when we were getting ready to deploy on the ship it was kind of like oh well you know we'll
00:44:08.16 --> 00:44:11.52 just because you're not allowed to drink any alcohol on the ship you're not allowed to have
00:44:11.52 --> 00:44:16.000 any alcohol you're not allowed drinking alcohol you after 90 days it's see you can get a beer day
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:24.40 they give 45 or 45 or back when I was in the sea get you get one beer 45 days so they gave us
00:44:24.40 --> 00:44:30.40 it two beers but I will say they gave us fosters so they were big oil cans right but you're
00:44:30.40 --> 00:44:36.32 living large yeah I did two two beer days in one deployment anyways you're not allowed other
00:44:36.32 --> 00:44:42.000 than that you're not allowed to drink that's the rules and so I think it wasn't like we openly
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.32 discussed like how we gonna smuggle beer or maybe we did a little bit but our bosses came down
00:44:46.32 --> 00:44:51.36 to like yeah well there's no drinking on no drinking on the ship and we were like okay those
00:44:51.36 --> 00:44:56.08 little they just came down and put the rules down like hey no drinking on the ship and I had
00:44:56.08 --> 00:45:02.88 respect for my off my platoon commander at the time had respect for my platoon chief at the time
00:45:03.60 --> 00:45:08.08 and they came down and said yeah well there's no drinking on ship so don't even think about it
00:45:08.08 --> 00:45:11.92 we're like okay cool that's the lock came down and we just got on board we just got on board with it
00:45:12.80 --> 00:45:19.44 whereas if it would have been well you know a little bit of wishy washing us us young E3's E4's
00:45:19.44 --> 00:45:24.32 and E5's if they would have been remotely wishy washing we didn't like oh cool you guys go drink
00:45:24.32 --> 00:45:28.08 whatever you want just don't let us see it or whatever and that would have been bad because eventually
00:45:28.08 --> 00:45:33.60 guess what you put a bunch of seals on a ship with with booze and you leave them on there for
00:45:33.60 --> 00:45:37.84 multiple days it's see months it's see well they're gonna have an incident of some kind they're
00:45:37.84 --> 00:45:41.52 gonna get a fight they're gonna throw up somewhere they're gonna you know some just dumb stuff
00:45:41.52 --> 00:45:47.52 it's gonna get to the highest level of attention it's gonna be a total disaster so the idea of
00:45:47.52 --> 00:45:51.68 actually just stepping up and holding the line and I'll tell you what I learned as a leader
00:45:52.72 --> 00:45:58.40 is it's liberating to do that it's liberating to say hey look here's the rules and and you know
00:45:58.40 --> 00:46:02.80 I did this with the fact of when we got back to our body we got to our body and they told us
00:46:02.80 --> 00:46:06.64 we had to work with Iraqi soldiers and everyone was kind of him and it honed about having to work with Iraqi
00:46:06.64 --> 00:46:12.72 soldiers and I told you guys don't even submit a concept of operations without Iraqi soldiers don't even
00:46:12.72 --> 00:46:19.12 submit it because we're not doing it and you guys were like okay got it yeah it is super liberating
00:46:19.12 --> 00:46:24.24 I think that's the you know one of the things that that I you know that I learned from you as we
00:46:24.24 --> 00:46:29.28 started working together I mean and I talked to be about this all the time I talked about on the podcast
00:46:29.28 --> 00:46:34.48 before but it was the kind of things that you know you probably should be doing but for whatever
00:46:34.48 --> 00:46:38.88 reason you are and and you know for you could just put it perspective for me like it's very black and
00:46:38.88 --> 00:46:42.80 why not like no if you're not if you're not holding the line on these things that are important
00:46:42.80 --> 00:46:46.08 and pushing your team to perform with the highest standard or make it sure they're not going to do
00:46:46.08 --> 00:46:50.72 something it's going to get them in trouble or cause massive issues not only for us but for the entire
00:46:50.72 --> 00:46:55.60 you know not on for our unit but the entire seal teams then then that's you're failing them as a
00:46:55.60 --> 00:47:00.32 leader you you've got to hold the line on that stuff you've got to and and it is very liberating
00:47:00.32 --> 00:47:05.44 to say oh check okay that's the way it is and I think that ambiguity is very frustrating for people
00:47:05.44 --> 00:47:08.56 but they don't know what's right you don't know what's wrong they can get away with stuff
00:47:08.56 --> 00:47:12.40 yeah that's what I was going to say but the people below you and the chain of command they
00:47:12.40 --> 00:47:16.24 get frustrated because they're like what was that mean and they're going to push it to the envelope
00:47:16.24 --> 00:47:20.32 but they just got got away with it over here but that guy didn't you know I mean that's yeah those are
00:47:20.32 --> 00:47:24.000 the kind of things where there needs to there's got to be a standard you got to hold that standard and
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:30.000 it's I it the team is so much better off when you do that and certainly bruiser absolutely was
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:37.20 and and this is one of those things where then people think well juggle always holds the line and
00:47:37.20 --> 00:47:42.08 there would be no slack whatsoever right no fucking slack right that's how we roll and it's like
00:47:42.08 --> 00:47:47.68 hmm actually there is slack and there's times where you give slack I mean I mean I always talk about
00:47:47.68 --> 00:47:52.24 and we always talk about how I was super strict about uniforms right like hey we're going to
00:47:52.24 --> 00:47:55.92 wear uniforms no patches all this stuff right we talk about that stuff all the time but when someone
00:47:55.92 --> 00:48:01.20 wasn't when we when we were when we were in our camp I didn't care what you wore if you were
00:48:01.20 --> 00:48:06.16 going to be interacting with the army of the Marine Corps I didn't care what you wore at all I mean
00:48:06.16 --> 00:48:10.24 I barely put on a shirt when we were on bed right I mean I'd be sitting in the tactical operations
00:48:10.24 --> 00:48:16.96 that are let me flip flops yeah flip flops and that's it yeah it brown t-shirt and sometimes yeah
00:48:16.96 --> 00:48:22.64 sometimes and and so I didn't I'm not holding line I'm not getting crazy because guess what that's
00:48:22.64 --> 00:48:28.96 not important if I would have been running around policing up people's uniforms inside of our camp
00:48:28.96 --> 00:48:36.96 which was just us man I would have wasted a bunch of leadership capital and frustrated everyone
00:48:36.96 --> 00:48:44.16 and then guess what when I tell them hey you got to learn how to program your radio that is that is
00:48:44.16 --> 00:48:49.04 explained with the same importance as hey you got to blouse your boots when you're inside our camp
00:48:49.04 --> 00:48:54.48 that's the wrong message to send so that's why this that's why I wrote this book because this is
00:48:54.48 --> 00:48:58.64 about balance you've got to be able to balance when to hold the line what's important what's
00:48:58.64 --> 00:49:03.28 worth holding line for and what things do you go okay you know what you know what lathe you
00:49:03.28 --> 00:49:07.92 guys want to do it that way that's cool go do it and that's what you need to learn that balance
00:49:08.72 --> 00:49:17.36 that balance is hard it's hard to do I think that again I think the awareness of it I think the
00:49:17.36 --> 00:49:24.80 awareness of it and I don't really know when I recognize the awareness of it I mean I know
00:49:24.80 --> 00:49:30.96 like when when Flynn Flynn puts up the slides of like the juggle breathe from back in the day
00:49:30.96 --> 00:49:35.92 I talked about the dichotomy leadership back then I'm surprised I even knew what dichotomy meant
00:49:37.12 --> 00:49:41.68 I literally forgot what I'm looking for the brief I looked at I remember what I'm talking about
00:49:41.68 --> 00:49:47.36 but it's one of those things I recognized it I saw it and I could definitely see it but
00:49:48.40 --> 00:49:52.56 now and just the more we work with companies even when I was in the teams the more I was working with
00:49:52.56 --> 00:49:58.24 the see-up tune you'd see when a guy was like here's a good example you know when a guy talks too much
00:49:58.24 --> 00:50:02.40 when you have a leader that just talks all the time just doesn't stop he always has something
00:50:02.40 --> 00:50:07.84 else he he won't let anyone else get the last word it's always that guy's people stop listening to
00:50:07.84 --> 00:50:12.32 him because he's talking all the time and it's like hey I got a good idea well why don't you be
00:50:12.32 --> 00:50:18.56 quiet for a little while and I hated to have to tell that to somebody because they get super self-conscious
00:50:18.56 --> 00:50:22.48 but you know I'm usually phrased it a different way like hey you should you should let your
00:50:22.48 --> 00:50:26.40 guys run a little bit you know let them let them get the last word and let it's going to give
00:50:26.40 --> 00:50:30.24 them more ownership of what you're doing if when they get done saying and that's how we're going
00:50:30.24 --> 00:50:35.28 to do it tonight and then this guy chimes in and you know what when we do it that way and you're
00:50:35.28 --> 00:50:41.36 like oh you don't need to say it again you think you don't need to double tap guys would say this
00:50:41.36 --> 00:50:46.80 debriefing I'm going to double tap that but that's already been tapped don't double tap it
00:50:46.80 --> 00:50:50.72 we're going to triple tap this thing we used to have a symbol if you can't see this here listen
00:50:50.72 --> 00:50:56.08 we put our two whatever two pea signs and touch your thumbs together and it's like four legs
00:50:56.08 --> 00:51:00.56 sticking up in the air that's a dead horse that's the symbol for dead horse bro you don't need to
00:51:00.56 --> 00:51:06.72 say this again it's dead horse quit beating it to death wait what is double what is tap double tap
00:51:06.72 --> 00:51:10.72 double tap well when you shoot a target you shoot it once and then what you normally do is you shoot
00:51:10.72 --> 00:51:15.76 a twice boom boom and so it's called a double tap so go back a fast mobile so if I was
00:51:15.76 --> 00:51:22.72 doing briefing you and and I was like echo you know you need to keep your shop groups a little bit
00:51:22.72 --> 00:51:28.32 tighter on the next run cool you got it and I said well the double tap on that you know you really
00:51:28.32 --> 00:51:31.36 need to work on the shop yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
00:51:31.36 --> 00:51:36.32 I'm saying the same thing kind of like I second that notion it kind of thing it is but if you said that
00:51:36.32 --> 00:51:43.12 if you said I second that you could leave it there right but if you said I second that because you
00:51:43.12 --> 00:51:47.36 really need to tighten up your groups because your groups are a little bit dispersed around the
00:51:47.36 --> 00:51:50.16 target area and that's going to be bad we all know it's bad bro we all know it's bad bro
00:51:50.16 --> 00:51:57.68 you know we all know it's thing thing office space TPS report yeah I understand clear now and
00:51:58.72 --> 00:52:05.76 now all that being said so it's cool I think again having the combat stories let some of these things
00:52:05.76 --> 00:52:10.32 sign and that's a good example right there you're talking first person what you're actually thinking
00:52:10.32 --> 00:52:19.04 which I think is powerful but it's good also to to outline the principles and that's what we did
00:52:19.04 --> 00:52:23.92 so here's one of the principles we outlined and this is an important one because
00:52:25.12 --> 00:52:29.04 man we got because we talk about being aggressive as a matter of fact we have T shirts it's a
00:52:29.04 --> 00:52:33.60 default aggressive right like we're not playing around being aggressive and what does that mean
00:52:33.60 --> 00:52:40.000 that means that we get some people in the in the military and in the civilian sector that we say
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.88 D default mode aggressive they go default mode aggressive and they don't know when to stop they get
00:52:44.88 --> 00:52:49.68 reckless they get careless they go too hard and so going back to the book here
00:52:51.28 --> 00:52:58.000 problems aren't going to solve themselves a leader must get aggressive and take action to solve
00:52:58.80 --> 00:53:04.16 the problems and implement a solution being too passive and waiting for a solution to appear
00:53:04.16 --> 00:53:09.76 often enables the problem to escalate and get out of control the enemy isn't going to back off
00:53:09.76 --> 00:53:18.24 the leader must get aggressive and put the enemy in check the good deal isn't going to deliver
00:53:18.24 --> 00:53:25.44 itself to a company the leader has to go out and make a good deal happen changes and new
00:53:25.44 --> 00:53:31.44 methodologies in a team are going to implement themselves leaders need to aggressively implement them
00:53:32.08 --> 00:53:37.44 and aggressive mindset should be the default setting of any leader default aggressive
00:53:37.44 --> 00:53:45.28 this means that the best leaders the best teams don't wait to act instead understanding the
00:53:45.28 --> 00:53:50.96 strategic vision or commanders intent they aggressively execute to overcome obstacles
00:53:50.96 --> 00:53:57.44 capitalize on immediate opportunities accomplish the mission and win rather than
00:53:57.44 --> 00:54:03.28 passively waiting to be told what to do default aggressive leaders proactively seek out ways
00:54:03.28 --> 00:54:08.32 to further the strategic mission they understand the commanders intent and where they have authority
00:54:08.32 --> 00:54:14.96 to do so they execute for decisions that are beyond their pay grade or above their authority
00:54:14.96 --> 00:54:19.76 default aggressive leaders still make a recommendation of the chain of command to solve
00:54:19.76 --> 00:54:26.48 problems and execute key tasks to achieve strategic victory in seal platoons and task units
00:54:26.48 --> 00:54:32.40 we expect this from leaders at every level right down to the front line trooper in charge of just
00:54:32.40 --> 00:54:39.68 himself and his small piece of the mission but this mentality is crucial to any leader in any
00:54:39.68 --> 00:54:48.16 team or organization it is just as critical to success in business as on the battlefield
00:54:48.72 --> 00:54:57.60 aggressive means proactive but it doesn't mean that leaders can get angry lose their temper or be
00:54:57.60 --> 00:55:04.72 aggressive toward their people a leader must always deal professionally with subordinates on the team
00:55:04.72 --> 00:55:09.92 peers leaders up the chain of command customers or clients and personnel and supporting roles
00:55:09.92 --> 00:55:17.52 outside the immediate team speaking angrily to others is ineffective losing your temper is a sign
00:55:17.52 --> 00:55:24.56 of weakness the aggression that wins on the battlefield in business or in life is directed not
00:55:24.56 --> 00:55:32.48 toward people but toward solving problems achieving goals and accomplishing the mission it is also
00:55:32.48 --> 00:55:39.20 critical to balance aggression with careful thought and analysis to make sure that risks have been
00:55:39.20 --> 00:55:47.44 assessed and mitigated the dichotomy with the default aggressive mindset is that sometimes
00:55:47.44 --> 00:55:56.72 hesitation allows a leader to further understand a situation so that he or she can react properly to it
00:55:56.72 --> 00:56:02.88 rather than immediately respond to enemy fire sometimes the prudent decision is to wait and see how
00:56:02.88 --> 00:56:10.48 it develops is it a simple reconnaissance by fire is it a faint by the enemy meant to distract from the
00:56:10.48 --> 00:56:15.92 real attack is the enemy simply trying to lure you into a confined area where they have a
00:56:15.92 --> 00:56:23.20 superior force waiting to ambush a careful moment of consideration might reveal the enemies true
00:56:23.20 --> 00:56:30.64 intentions to be overly aggressive without critical thinking is to be reckless that can lead the
00:56:30.64 --> 00:56:37.44 team into a disaster and put the greater mission in peril to disregard prudent counsel when someone
00:56:37.44 --> 00:56:44.80 with experience urges caution to dismiss significant threats or to fail to plan for likely contingencies
00:56:44.80 --> 00:56:53.68 is foolhardy it is bad leadership a chief contributing factor to recklessness comes from what military
00:56:53.68 --> 00:57:00.88 historians have long referred to as the disease of victory this disease takes place when a few
00:57:00.88 --> 00:57:07.28 battlefield successes producing overconfidence in a team's own tactical prowess while underestimating
00:57:07.28 --> 00:57:14.16 the capabilities of its enemy or competitor this is a problem not just for combat leaders but for
00:57:14.16 --> 00:57:21.20 leaders and teams anywhere in any arena throughout the business world and the civilian sector it is
00:57:21.20 --> 00:57:29.36 a leaders duty to fight against this disease so that the team despite its success never gets complacent
00:57:30.56 --> 00:57:37.12 the risking any action must be carefully weighed against the potential rewards of mission success
00:57:37.12 --> 00:57:46.16 and of course to counter that thought the cost of inaction must be weighed as well as aggressive
00:57:46.16 --> 00:57:53.28 as leaders must be leaders must be cautious that they are not running to their deaths simply because
00:57:53.28 --> 00:58:01.28 it is their instinct to take action that I caught a me between aggression and caution must be balanced
00:58:01.28 --> 00:58:12.24 so be aggressive but never reckless so there's a principle principle laid out and then of
00:58:12.24 --> 00:58:19.12 course it's followed up with a business example of which there are manifold of businesses where
00:58:19.76 --> 00:58:25.76 the business gets too aggressive they start getting properties to put more stores into and they build
00:58:25.76 --> 00:58:29.44 up all this rent that they got to pay every month the next thing you know they have a down
00:58:29.44 --> 00:58:33.92 month and they got real estate bills to pay or they start hiring a ton of people because they
00:58:33.92 --> 00:58:37.84 get a super aggressive and that's you know kind of where this story leads to is we're bringing
00:58:37.84 --> 00:58:40.96 going to bring in all these people because we think this future success is coming and the next thing
00:58:40.96 --> 00:58:46.56 you know your overhead is so huge because you got overly aggressive you end up with problems
00:58:47.84 --> 00:58:52.72 that is hard too that's so hard because that is absolutely in my nature is to
00:58:53.36 --> 00:58:57.04 and I think and to and so many people that resonate with extreme ownership that come to the
00:58:57.04 --> 00:59:01.84 monsters that I mean we've got default aggressive leaders that want to go dominate the universe
00:59:01.84 --> 00:59:05.84 and you've got to really you've got to really take a step back in the touch and think okay
00:59:05.84 --> 00:59:10.08 what am I not thinking about what I'm not seeing how my planning for those contingencies we
00:59:10.08 --> 00:59:15.20 just talked about you know a situation today you know with a client where you know they
00:59:15.20 --> 00:59:20.40 when things are going really well that's when you've got to be looking at what what what's
00:59:20.40 --> 00:59:24.88 what's about to go wrong and I haven't seen yet you know what I'm not planning for so
00:59:24.88 --> 00:59:29.68 it is very very difficult to balance this is a leader but you absolutely have to balance that you
00:59:29.68 --> 00:59:33.84 have to be aggressive you have to maneuver you know so many people get you know the the
00:59:33.84 --> 00:59:38.80 paralysis to analysis you know people talk about don't want to make it make a decision until
00:59:38.80 --> 00:59:44.000 you know the solution is right there and it's 100% guarantee nothing is ever 100% guarantee
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.52 and by that time that's you know that's even close to being that you know the your
00:59:47.52 --> 00:59:51.20 competition's already maneuvered on the battlefield you're going to get wiped out and killed
00:59:51.20 --> 00:59:55.04 you know in the business world you know you're going to get you're going to get crushed by
00:59:55.04 --> 01:00:00.56 your competition and so you and yet being aggressive and also being prudent so that you're not
01:00:00.56 --> 01:00:05.04 falling in the traps not running to your death not sending your team up for total disaster
01:00:05.04 --> 01:00:11.44 and it's it's the only the only answer to this the only answer to this is you have to be balanced
01:00:11.44 --> 01:00:17.92 that's the only answer because if you go too far in one direction you know if you get super aggressive
01:00:17.92 --> 01:00:22.96 and you take too much risk and you'll get wiped out if you don't do anything and you sit there
01:00:22.96 --> 01:00:28.40 you're going to get wiped out you have to you have to balance these two all the time and
01:00:29.28 --> 01:00:35.68 yeah you're right this is something that it's something that we see all the time and I saw
01:00:35.68 --> 01:00:40.80 you know training seal platoons you get the guy that's super hyper aggressive and every time
01:00:40.80 --> 01:00:45.36 there's something going on there hey let's send a fire team over there and okay you send
01:00:45.36 --> 01:00:48.80 a fire team over there and then that fire team gets whacked and then another fire team over there okay
01:00:48.80 --> 01:00:51.60 then that fire team gets whacked and then another fire team next thing you know you're ever
01:00:51.60 --> 01:00:56.40 a patoon left okay so that was good you got everyone killed because you were hyper aggressive
01:00:56.40 --> 01:01:00.000 the other end of the spectrum is what we're not sure where the fire's coming from so we're going to
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:05.60 sit here and wait okay well while you're not shooting at the enemy the enemy is maneuvering
01:01:05.60 --> 01:01:09.44 and they are getting high ground and they are getting a superior position and this is the exact
01:01:09.44 --> 01:01:15.12 same thing in the business world where I mean the the example of like hey we got to grow and so
01:01:15.12 --> 01:01:20.40 the aggressive leader the overly aggressive the hyper aggressive leader will grow too fast
01:01:20.40 --> 01:01:27.76 and all of a sudden has overhead that's too much and can't afford to go on but at the same time
01:01:27.76 --> 01:01:32.96 you get a you get a company that's not that's not aggressive enough and they should be entering
01:01:32.96 --> 01:01:38.96 another another line of operation they should be putting they should be entering another market
01:01:39.52 --> 01:01:44.32 you know we were talking about this morning while we were working out block blockbuster
01:01:44.32 --> 01:01:49.92 and blackberry right blockbuster and blackberry who would have thought that blockbuster which was
01:01:49.92 --> 01:01:53.76 there was a blockbuster on every street corner there was a block blackberry and everyone's pocket
01:01:54.48 --> 01:01:58.72 and they owned something like 80 something percent of the market share that they're done
01:01:59.36 --> 01:02:04.24 now are you telling me that someone that was default aggressive would have said you know what
01:02:04.88 --> 01:02:09.04 we need to figure out how to you know what these these these movies might be able to come on the
01:02:09.04 --> 01:02:13.76 internet in fact there's streaming video let's get into that market and of course they would
01:02:13.76 --> 01:02:18.08 have the capital they would have the infrastructure they would have the people and they could
01:02:18.08 --> 01:02:22.72 they would have been able to make that happen they had relationships with with the with the
01:02:23.76 --> 01:02:27.04 with the big Hollywood studios right they were getting sent those movies they had
01:02:27.04 --> 01:02:31.76 relationships they could have done that but they were sitting there going we were you're going to
01:02:31.76 --> 01:02:38.16 come rent these videos for 499 you got to get that VHS tape up in here right if that's the way it's
01:02:38.16 --> 01:02:42.24 got to be and same thing with blackberry they're thinking on loans gonna leave us because we got the
01:02:42.24 --> 01:02:48.08 little thing with the keyboard on it and we're set and meanwhile they're they're both done
01:02:48.80 --> 01:02:54.56 done lack of aggressive lack of foresight lack of planning and and for me it's really just lack
01:02:54.56 --> 01:02:59.60 of being aggressive aggressively looking around now we could go the other way and we could look at
01:02:59.60 --> 01:03:05.76 look at companies that put so much capital out there that they run out of money and they go
01:03:05.76 --> 01:03:12.000 they go down to so what do you have to do you have to balance you have to balance such which
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.68 you have to do you know one more thing I think we do one more thing from this from this book
01:03:19.12 --> 01:03:24.16 just you and this is short little piece we were talking about earlier and it kind of relates
01:03:24.16 --> 01:03:28.88 to what and I think the reason we were talking about because it was kind of related in the disease
01:03:28.88 --> 01:03:35.20 of victory you had that little chunk again we do the we do the applications of business so people can see
01:03:36.48 --> 01:03:41.20 really directly how these principles in combat and the principal correlates to the civilian
01:03:41.20 --> 01:03:51.04 sector but you had a good one just a couple paragraphs on 84 about your kind of a stereotypical fire
01:03:51.04 --> 01:03:59.20 up extreme ownership boss that's going to come in there and make stuff happen I thought this was a good one go
01:04:01.04 --> 01:04:05.60 I've read a lot about patent the executive vice president said with pride referring to general
01:04:05.60 --> 01:04:10.96 George S. Paton Jr the famous U.S. Army general who's exploits in World War II were legendary
01:04:11.52 --> 01:04:15.60 I love that you reference patent in your presentation I want exactly the kind of discipline
01:04:15.60 --> 01:04:20.56 organization around here that patent expected we need people who carry out orders not
01:04:20.56 --> 01:04:26.32 question them I could tell right away that the executive vice president had no previous military
01:04:26.32 --> 01:04:31.60 experience he clearly misunderstood how effective leaders in the military led their teams it was not
01:04:31.60 --> 01:04:37.92 through rigid authoritarianism do this because I said so or you'll be punished sure there were
01:04:37.92 --> 01:04:45.28 those the military who tried to lead like that but it was never effective so there you go and I know
01:04:45.28 --> 01:04:50.96 you and I both and the rest of the team has dealt with guys that they they have that vision of
01:04:50.96 --> 01:04:54.40 this military leadership and usually it's guys that weren't the military and you know I like to
01:04:54.40 --> 01:05:00.40 draw a line and maybe I'm right maybe I'm wrong about this I think well and and from what I know
01:05:00.96 --> 01:05:09.60 from military history when you go back to conscripts when you when you get to the conscripts those
01:05:09.60 --> 01:05:14.000 guys are beaten until they are doing what they you know what they're told to do and we've we've
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.88 covered some great examples of that on this podcast of situations where it's like oh you know
01:05:18.88 --> 01:05:22.40 what you know how we're going to lead we're going to lead through tyranny and we're going to lead through
01:05:22.40 --> 01:05:28.72 punishment and we're going to lead through rigid discipline rigid discipline which obviously everyone
01:05:28.72 --> 01:05:33.36 knows I'm a fan of discipline but when you're leading guys and the reason that they're following
01:05:33.36 --> 01:05:40.96 your orders is because they fear being beaten or fear being shot that but shot by you you know
01:05:40.96 --> 01:05:47.44 punished by you if that's why they're again it's the same situation where if that's why they're doing it
01:05:47.44 --> 01:05:54.64 you're never going to get the true optimal work and effort out of those people ever and even
01:05:54.64 --> 01:05:59.60 from from history I mean if you read Alexander the Great right or Julia Caesar who's a great
01:05:59.60 --> 01:06:04.80 example and they had conscripts but his men loved him and admired him and held him in tremendous
01:06:04.80 --> 01:06:10.72 regards because he he rewarded them he gave them credit he he explained well high I mean he was he was a guy
01:06:10.72 --> 01:06:17.28 who was always put himself at the forefront of of where the fighting was and you know much more
01:06:17.28 --> 01:06:22.64 so than just a political leader like many of the Roman the Roman leaders so just a phenomenal leader
01:06:22.64 --> 01:06:27.92 on the battlefield and so even even then you're the most effective leaders are always going to be
01:06:27.92 --> 01:06:32.000 they're always going to try to get the team on board with a mission help them understand why they're
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.04 doing it put it put a greater purpose in their mind and I think so often as you said before
01:06:37.04 --> 01:06:41.36 you know leader leader like that this was this was a aggressive leader great you know great
01:06:41.36 --> 01:06:45.28 person who wanted to dominate the universe and and make things happen love extreme ownership
01:06:45.28 --> 01:06:49.44 and yet is is struggling to see that because they think they're leading like you would lead
01:06:49.44 --> 01:06:54.08 they look at they look at a picture jockel like this is what jockel would do it's just crush everyone
01:06:54.08 --> 01:06:58.24 and tell them to do it because I said and and as you've explained it doesn't work it doesn't work that
01:06:58.24 --> 01:07:03.92 way it's never effective and that's why that's why I'm proud of this book and I think it'd be so
01:07:03.92 --> 01:07:08.64 useful to leaders to see you can't do that if you do that you're not ever going to be a success
01:07:08.64 --> 01:07:14.40 was you could be if you actually get the team on board explain why to them and and tie that to the
01:07:14.40 --> 01:07:18.96 bigger purpose of of what you're trying to accomplish in the world yeah yeah I think that's
01:07:19.84 --> 01:07:25.76 all true I think the book will be helpful to people so yeah that caught a new leadership it's coming
01:07:25.76 --> 01:07:30.80 out September 25th if you want to if you want to get some you can get some of that we got some
01:07:30.80 --> 01:07:39.52 Q&A we got some questions to discuss here how does jump right into it number one what are
01:07:39.52 --> 01:07:45.52 speaking of that this is this is falling together quite nicely question number one what are things
01:07:45.52 --> 01:07:53.12 to look for when you're debating whether to raise your voice or yell due to those under you being lazy
01:07:53.12 --> 01:07:58.80 or unmotivated y'all talk a lot about the importance of self control and not just losing it
01:07:59.60 --> 01:08:04.64 but would you say there's a time and place for raising the intensity while still being respectful
01:08:04.64 --> 01:08:10.80 towards your guys so there you go yellin and scream it gets them sometimes you gotta just drop the hammer
01:08:12.48 --> 01:08:17.76 jocco yelled and scream it us all the time like I've I've talked about on this you know I think on the
01:08:17.76 --> 01:08:23.28 podcast we started talking about all the time and the number of times at jocco screamed and yelled at me
01:08:24.40 --> 01:08:28.56 zero zero times in all the years that we worked together and and I know I gave him
01:08:29.12 --> 01:08:34.24 at least dozens maybe hundreds of opportunities that we want to probably done that and he didn't
01:08:34.24 --> 01:08:40.40 do that because he realized it it wasn't effective so now listen there there is there is a time where
01:08:40.80 --> 01:08:45.20 you know if there's a major safety issue going on you're trying to get people's attention and you
01:08:45.20 --> 01:08:49.28 want people to cease fire or you need to rally the truth where you got to raise your voice and
01:08:49.28 --> 01:08:53.28 get people's attention and I think that's you can't be afraid to do that as a little bit. There's
01:08:53.28 --> 01:08:57.04 certainly times where I say hey life get get those bodies lined up over there or stuff like that I mean
01:08:57.04 --> 01:09:02.40 for sure that's is that yelling well yeah I'm definitely raising my voice and using a loud voice but
01:09:02.40 --> 01:09:10.80 I'm not doing it whatever with anger it's just hey you got to hear me and so and also you know
01:09:10.80 --> 01:09:14.96 there is time where you've got to you've got to pick up the intensity in your voice so that people
01:09:14.96 --> 01:09:19.76 realize there's something important happening right there's just enough now you don't want to
01:09:19.76 --> 01:09:25.84 yell and scream and get all crazy but to be like hey I need vehicles here now like that is different
01:09:25.84 --> 01:09:29.76 then hey can you get the vehicles over here now right those are two different things and you
01:09:30.32 --> 01:09:35.84 I would react differently if I heard those two voices so yes now to go back and this vehicle
01:09:35.84 --> 01:09:39.84 over you now no one now we're creating a whole panic situation but that that's a great point too
01:09:39.84 --> 01:09:45.92 right and it's it's the kind of you know never cry wolf you know sorry so when when you're if you're
01:09:45.92 --> 01:09:50.16 yelling all the time how do you do vehicles over here right now when there's nothing at stake and it's
01:09:50.16 --> 01:09:55.60 no big deal and it's just a routine movement you know then when you do that and you really need it
01:09:56.16 --> 01:10:00.64 then no one's paying attention they think oh it's just life yelling again into the radio so
01:10:00.64 --> 01:10:07.20 so I think that's another reason why I actually have seen Jaco raised his voice on one occasion
01:10:07.20 --> 01:10:13.92 yeah and when there was a series issue that needed to be addressed and you needed to get the
01:10:13.92 --> 01:10:18.96 person's attention to show just how serious of a situation it was and it got everybody's attention
01:10:18.96 --> 01:10:22.64 yeah it got everybody's attention right away because you never did that and when you did do it
01:10:22.64 --> 01:10:28.24 it was like oh man yeah and I was always tell that to leaders like being on the radio and this
01:10:28.24 --> 01:10:31.92 good goes for being in a meeting right if you go to a meeting if you're in charge of a meeting
01:10:31.92 --> 01:10:36.16 and you talk the whole time and then you have something important to say at the end well that's great
01:10:36.16 --> 01:10:41.12 but it's not as impactful as when you say very few things during the meeting and then at the end you
01:10:41.12 --> 01:10:47.04 say hey guys listen up here's what's going on with us and everyone pays attention so I've said this
01:10:47.04 --> 01:10:52.80 before the last you talk the more people listen and that goes true here the more you yell the last
01:10:52.80 --> 01:10:58.16 people listen and it takes away the opportunity if you ever do have to yell it's going to have
01:10:58.16 --> 01:11:04.72 zero impact so my blanket statement is you should hardly ever have to raise your voice and
01:11:04.72 --> 01:11:14.08 it should just barely ever happen next question it's a long one can you explain
01:11:15.04 --> 01:11:21.52 more how you managed working with the local Iraqi troops general matters who I hold in the
01:11:21.52 --> 01:11:27.04 highest extreme a steam said something to the effect that if you are doing anything that negatively
01:11:27.04 --> 01:11:32.24 impacts relations with allied forces you are of more used to the enemy than you are to the
01:11:32.24 --> 01:11:38.40 your team this makes it quite obvious that he believes that full cooperation with allied forces
01:11:38.40 --> 01:11:44.16 is key to attaining victory it is a well established fact that most of the Iraqi forces were
01:11:44.16 --> 01:11:51.36 incompetent to the point of posing danger to US troops so what steps did you take to ensure success
01:11:51.36 --> 01:12:00.72 when working with them well obviously relations with your allies are critical it's cover move
01:12:00.72 --> 01:12:05.60 ready you got to work together as a team and if you're working against each other that's absolutely
01:12:05.60 --> 01:12:13.28 catastrophic I think for us with Iraqi troops you know again we talked about how that was
01:12:13.28 --> 01:12:17.92 liberating right for for you know the big pushback was always like we want to do just seal
01:12:17.92 --> 01:12:23.36 you don't matter what race we call just seals or just Americans you know just like NATO ally
01:12:23.36 --> 01:12:30.96 forces and not work with with Iraqi troops and you know when you said that right away attack
01:12:30.96 --> 01:12:35.36 that's good listen don't even put up a concept of operations we have a connoisse we call it
01:12:35.36 --> 01:12:40.16 which is the approval for the plan that doesn't have Iraqi troops on it okay got it we're going
01:12:40.16 --> 01:12:44.32 to figure out a way to make that happen so that was the lime was drawn we knew we had to do that
01:12:44.32 --> 01:12:48.40 and we knew it was also important I mean because you explained that we talked about it we we thought
01:12:48.40 --> 01:12:53.76 through that but obviously we had to take some steps to mitigate that so I think there were
01:12:55.04 --> 01:12:59.52 again this is a dichotomy it's you got to be balanced there were I saw units who thought
01:13:00.40 --> 01:13:05.44 and we gave some examples even extreme ownership certainly and we talk about regular
01:13:05.44 --> 01:13:09.68 about where you you see a unit that would take two or four Americans in a bunch of Iraqis and
01:13:09.68 --> 01:13:13.44 try to go into really bad area like man you look you're not going to be able to count on those
01:13:13.44 --> 01:13:17.84 Iraqis in the middle of a gunfight when they're overwhelmed you better have enough Americans
01:13:17.84 --> 01:13:22.88 here to have you back so so they were asking too much of of the Iraqis and then their other
01:13:22.88 --> 01:13:25.52 units that didn't want to do you know didn't want to have any Iraqis with them didn't want
01:13:25.52 --> 01:13:30.88 any relationship with them and I had some stern talking to you know talking to some of my guys
01:13:30.88 --> 01:13:35.12 who wouldn't what weren't treating our Iraqi soldiers with respect I threatened one of my
01:13:35.12 --> 01:13:39.52 guys who was going to have to go sleep in the Iraqis so just barracks if you didn't go shake their hand
01:13:39.52 --> 01:13:44.96 I think you know in that time individual who's a great guy I think that was the last threat
01:13:44.96 --> 01:13:50.48 you had to make him submit to you I think I was serious the president I'm totally serious
01:13:50.48 --> 01:13:56.88 I'm serious so and we all what props to props to SF guys, mid teams that go out there and they do they
01:13:56.88 --> 01:14:02.08 live they eat you know even even having to code a mile in here he did two meals a day out of three
01:14:02.08 --> 01:14:08.48 with with his afghan soldiers that's that's awesome and you know what I liked about this
01:14:08.48 --> 01:14:16.16 question was the way that that it relates to to the civilian sector because you know what I talk
01:14:16.16 --> 01:14:21.28 about a lot a lot of times I talk about how my relationship with my boss regardless of who my boss
01:14:21.28 --> 01:14:25.44 was regardless of my boss was great or my boss was horrible my relationship was always the same
01:14:25.44 --> 01:14:29.84 I was going to have this great I was going to build relationship where they trusted me they gave me
01:14:29.84 --> 01:14:33.28 what I needed to do my job and then they let me do my job that's the relationship I always had with all my
01:14:33.28 --> 01:14:41.76 bosses right but I I that same methodology and concept can absolutely be applied to other
01:14:41.76 --> 01:14:46.40 organizations that you're supposed to work with so whether it's the army whether it's the
01:14:46.40 --> 01:14:53.68 Marine Corps whether it's the Iraqi soldiers whether it's the MPs whether it's the I the the intel
01:14:53.68 --> 01:14:58.88 people that the intel organization that you're working with no matter what the organization you can
01:14:58.88 --> 01:15:04.16 build a relationship again might you love that organization no you might not and where I see this all
01:15:04.16 --> 01:15:07.76 the time it well we see it all the time now is with businesses because guess what there's no
01:15:07.76 --> 01:15:12.56 business that's stand on the worship center is very few that are completely vertically integrated
01:15:12.56 --> 01:15:17.36 businesses I mean like an origin right we don't we we're pretty vertically integrated but guess
01:15:17.36 --> 01:15:21.84 what we don't grow the cotton like we don't do that we don't grow cotton but guess what we have a
01:15:21.84 --> 01:15:26.16 good relationship with the people that grow cotton we have a good relationship with the people at
01:15:26.16 --> 01:15:32.40 stain the cotton or sorry die the cotton so we build those relationships with those other people now
01:15:33.20 --> 01:15:38.000 I work with businesses where there's a supplier that they don't like so guess what they
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.52 form a hostile relationship with this whole company a whole company what could does that do them
01:15:43.52 --> 01:15:48.24 it doesn't do them any good at all what it means is they have no personal relationships they
01:15:48.24 --> 01:15:53.28 they form that antagonistic relationship with a whole other organization and it's almost impossible to
01:15:53.28 --> 01:15:59.68 overcome so now this is something where if you don't explain that culture throughout your team they're
01:15:59.68 --> 01:16:03.52 going to treat that other team horribly and so if you're waiting on supplies if you're on a construction
01:16:03.52 --> 01:16:08.16 site and you're waiting for materials to be delivered and you don't have a good relationship with
01:16:08.16 --> 01:16:14.16 the people that deliver the drywall and now the drywall's run late for whatever reason and you call
01:16:14.16 --> 01:16:20.32 you you fly off the handle or whatever you're you're not going to get that drywall any earlier
01:16:20.32 --> 01:16:26.16 it's not happening heavy ever you know when I call customer service right customer service I
01:16:26.16 --> 01:16:30.56 learned this when I was working for the animal working for the animals aid I'd call up we didn't
01:16:30.56 --> 01:16:38.16 we travel a lot and I'd have to call up whatever delta or American whoever and I'd be trying to get
01:16:38.16 --> 01:16:44.40 whatever seats on an aircraft or something or a flight that was full or whatever get him an upgrade
01:16:44.40 --> 01:16:50.80 whatever and you know that's a hey how you doing that's always a I always start off with the
01:16:50.80 --> 01:16:54.72 with the because they're gone American airline how can I help you and they're mad right they're just
01:16:54.72 --> 01:17:02.48 mad to start with like how to get their mad whatever you know airline whatever car rental service
01:17:02.48 --> 01:17:07.28 whatever restaurant like people are just mad they're care they're mad they don't know who you are
01:17:07.28 --> 01:17:11.28 well they actually they've just talked to probably you know the last 25 people of screen
01:17:11.28 --> 01:17:16.48 screen in the island that's awful so you know you you call them and say hey how's it going and
01:17:16.48 --> 01:17:21.84 you know I always I had little head little micro jokes that I would make with the airlines
01:17:21.84 --> 01:17:26.16 that I used them with all of them all the time but one of them was I'd say they'd say well
01:17:26.16 --> 01:17:30.80 do you need to sit next to your boss and I'd say you know what I'd honestly appreciate it
01:17:30.80 --> 01:17:34.16 if you put me as far away from it and they'd laugh and then they'd try and hook me up even
01:17:34.16 --> 01:17:38.32 though my boss was a great guy and I'd sit with them all day but just it was a funny thing and it
01:17:38.32 --> 01:17:43.44 humanized me with them they thought I was that some poor sorry bastard that had to travel
01:17:43.44 --> 01:17:47.92 with his boss and then they were trying to take care of me it was like awesome so I would get the
01:17:47.92 --> 01:17:54.000 hookups I remember one time I went up and I had a conversation on the phone with someone and then
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.40 of course this is different because it was live but I had a conversation like no can't get
01:17:56.40 --> 01:18:00.24 you on that flight and then I went up to the counter and I was like hey how you doing I'm trying
01:18:00.24 --> 01:18:03.84 to get me in my boss and it's on this flight and we're trying to get there and and he's acting
01:18:03.84 --> 01:18:08.40 like this gross like well what do you know do you need to go to him like well look if we don't get there
01:18:08.88 --> 01:18:13.92 here's the deal if you can just get my boss on that's great if if neither one of us get
01:18:13.92 --> 01:18:20.56 get on this flight it's been nice knowing you because I'm screwed and she just started laughing
01:18:20.56 --> 01:18:24.40 and again humanized it and then it's like all of a sudden she's like oh guess what we're going
01:18:24.40 --> 01:18:27.76 to we're going to bump some of these or whatever and she's making room and we're on the flight
01:18:28.32 --> 01:18:33.20 so don't develop this antagonistic relationship with another organization
01:18:33.20 --> 01:18:38.08 with Iraqi soldiers like is it great working with Iraqi soldiers? No it sucks it's hard
01:18:38.88 --> 01:18:43.84 but guess what that's what we have to do and I'll tell you something else strategically
01:18:45.28 --> 01:18:51.76 the Iraqi soldiers that are descendants of the guys that we train I mean maybe not I'm saying training
01:18:51.76 --> 01:18:57.76 or or training descendants right the guys that we trained trained to guys who just went and
01:18:57.76 --> 01:19:03.12 fought back and got Ramadi back from ISIS and got Mazul back from ISIS those are the guys
01:19:03.12 --> 01:19:05.84 that went in there and did the bulk of the fight did they get supported by Americans yes did
01:19:05.84 --> 01:19:11.04 Americans do a kick-ass job of doing massive fire support yes but the guys that were moving from street
01:19:11.04 --> 01:19:16.64 to street those were majority Iraqi soldiers did they have special ops guys with them yes but
01:19:16.64 --> 01:19:20.000 it was a majority of the people that were moving through the streets where Iraqi soldiers
01:19:20.64 --> 01:19:26.40 and there's no way possible that wouldn't have happened if American coalition forces
01:19:26.40 --> 01:19:32.96 over the last whatever it was 10 years 12 years would have taken those guys and made them work
01:19:32.96 --> 01:19:38.40 and done the the type of partner missions that we did with them so it was and when I said again
01:19:38.40 --> 01:19:44.000 when I say we are not talking about us the the seal teams I'm talking about everyone everyone made
01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.52 this concerted effort and it ended up being a great call because when those guys went out to
01:19:50.64 --> 01:19:54.32 to finally have to fight to take these cities back they were able to do it
01:19:54.32 --> 01:19:59.36 not totally by themselves but they were able to do it they did it and that's a vast improvement
01:19:59.36 --> 01:20:04.08 if we were to send if we would have sent the Iraqi troops as they were when we were in
01:20:04.08 --> 01:20:10.96 Ramadi into Mazul they would have gotten decimated so it's a credit to the US military it's a
01:20:10.96 --> 01:20:14.96 credit to the Iraqi military that they have now gotten up to speed where they can push forward
01:20:14.96 --> 01:20:19.20 and it's a credit to the US military and other coalition forces that worked with them to get them
01:20:19.20 --> 01:20:26.16 up to speed and what that all boils back to is forming relationships with the people that you
01:20:26.16 --> 01:20:30.88 are dependent on not just the people but the organizations that's all it's in.
01:20:32.24 --> 01:20:38.64 Yeah I think they we learn less and it's let's do let's use them for their tricks and that's
01:20:38.64 --> 01:20:43.76 what we learn in Ramadi we put them in situations where they could succeed we took enough
01:20:43.76 --> 01:20:49.28 Americans where we could actually succeed and help them succeed and of course we put some
01:20:50.40 --> 01:20:54.56 some efforts to mitigate rest too with with all we always said armed guys the oil head guys
01:20:54.56 --> 01:20:58.96 looking around we always with presented a hard target if one of those guys decided that they wanted
01:20:58.96 --> 01:21:04.88 to start batting for the other team and we were in a position to handle those problems and we never had
01:21:04.88 --> 01:21:09.68 any issues as a result but that's what you have to do is it's all about building coalitions and
01:21:09.68 --> 01:21:14.16 using people's strengths and complimenting those strengths and working with the team it's
01:21:14.16 --> 01:21:18.56 cover move if you don't do that you're going to you're going to fail and to all you people at the
01:21:18.56 --> 01:21:24.08 airlines thank you thank you for taking care of me over the years appreciate it next question
01:21:25.20 --> 01:21:34.40 jocco lathe and echo your opinion has been solicited on this leadership question right here
01:21:34.40 --> 01:21:40.000 so we'll see how that works out a good leader ensures his team understands what their goals are
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:46.64 and why they are performing tasks but how do you balance doing this with not being the leader that
01:21:46.64 --> 01:21:51.52 talks so much that the team stops listening we do we just cover this for a long period of time pretty
01:21:51.52 --> 01:21:57.04 much it didn't we I guess we can leave it at this echo do you agree with what we said earlier
01:21:57.04 --> 01:22:02.64 or do you have a different opinion about talking too much and mind you you've said a lot today
01:22:02.64 --> 01:22:06.80 so don't be you know don't get crazy over it will stop listening
01:22:11.44 --> 01:22:16.80 the guy who talks too much no yeah less is more hundred percent go I like it
01:22:17.52 --> 01:22:22.56 I will say it musters when echo's echo's words to the audience
01:22:23.52 --> 01:22:27.84 he always gives an epic speech with we have solicited probably the greatest applause of
01:22:27.84 --> 01:22:35.60 everyone yeah I guess to dig into this a little bit of how to balance that with being a leader
01:22:35.60 --> 01:22:39.28 that talks too much I think you got to pay attention to what the reactions are you're getting
01:22:39.28 --> 01:22:44.32 for people right you got to pay attention to the reactions you're getting for people if the people are not
01:22:45.68 --> 01:22:52.000 totally actively listening to you right if they're not actively listening to you if they're
01:22:52.56 --> 01:22:56.48 taking notes if they're looking at their phone or not taking notes but if they're looking at their phone
01:22:56.48 --> 01:23:03.20 or whatever then you're you're talking too much keep it short keep concise and people will listen to
01:23:03.20 --> 01:23:10.80 you more also that when you say you got to pay attention to yourself that's like a deep one it's
01:23:10.80 --> 01:23:14.32 like you just said it really simply like I just pay attention to yourself I mean you didn't
01:23:14.32 --> 01:23:18.40 say like that but that's what it's telling that's the hardest part right there because a lot of
01:23:18.40 --> 01:23:22.88 times like hey me and life are talking and later it's looking at his phone I'm not thinking
01:23:22.88 --> 01:23:27.20 hey I'm talking too much I'm saying what I'm saying it's not interesting enough so I need so I need to say
01:23:27.20 --> 01:23:32.40 some more cool stuff or I need to be more of this or more of that because I'm losing them kind of thing
01:23:32.40 --> 01:23:38.48 like if I'm losing you the intuitive thought is not to to completely disconnect and stop talking that's
01:23:38.48 --> 01:23:43.36 not the intuitive thought seems like when you're in a situation you got to pay attention to that
01:23:43.36 --> 01:23:48.08 kind of stuff on yourself jocca does this all the time what do I do like buses phone out and
01:23:48.08 --> 01:23:53.52 start so yeah I don't even know whatever actually you know what okay I guess our conversation you know
01:23:53.52 --> 01:24:00.000 you know I do that to Dean and Dean Mr so Dean Dean is oh yeah this is a really important
01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.40 stuff we're talking about here is like yeah no what Dean does always he it makes him mad right he's
01:24:04.40 --> 01:24:10.96 got the he's got the pet peeve so Dean will be telling something and so you're doing a purpose to get
01:24:10.96 --> 01:24:17.60 a excuse no sometimes he's saying some rambling stuff right and I've got stuff going on Dean
01:24:17.60 --> 01:24:22.16 come on I know you're listening to this bro but sometimes he'll be saying something to me and all
01:24:22.16 --> 01:24:27.92 of the sudden I'll like look around up and and now I realize I'll just be watching people do
01:24:27.92 --> 01:24:31.60 do you just because we're normally on the map what this happens so he's telling me something like
01:24:31.60 --> 01:24:36.48 looking at the eyes and he's like you know in the ancient bubble bubble boy he'll be telling me
01:24:36.48 --> 01:24:42.000 about the Peloponnesian more something or whatever and and as I'm listening to him I'll kind of
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:46.96 look and I'll start looking at someone that's training or looking at someone and he'll like attack
01:24:46.96 --> 01:24:53.12 me he went through a period where he would just attack me and like take me down and just start
01:24:53.12 --> 01:24:59.36 you know going psycho on me so that got me tuned up I got me tuned up where I tried to give Dean
01:24:59.36 --> 01:25:03.92 some more attention yeah I like that yeah I think that's uh I think that's a good
01:25:03.92 --> 01:25:07.92 cause that's what you feel like when he starts doing that sort of the brats you what you're doing
01:25:07.92 --> 01:25:12.000 you know well the thing is though and I think you're in the same boat late for where I know
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.36 you kind of know now like in everyday life with other people you might think I mean intuitively
01:25:17.36 --> 01:25:22.000 anyway like on losing them or whatever but you can tell with him if he starts doing that stuff you're like
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.20 okay he's the most stop or yeah move on or something but it's all because you know the same
01:25:27.20 --> 01:25:34.56 as I listen if you can give me 35 more seconds we'll be honest and if you can move on to whatever you need to
01:25:34.56 --> 01:25:39.12 bad character or something that I have where I can do that sometimes I'm done listening to you
01:25:39.92 --> 01:25:46.16 so wrap it up of course you see all the time yeah just your one time asmba system all right
01:25:46.16 --> 01:25:55.36 next question for life this is a guy who have he won you know what all right life
01:25:55.36 --> 01:26:03.68 in and out burger or what a burger dude I do not want to go there man that is too much
01:26:04.32 --> 01:26:13.20 that's like double rainbow too much right this is uh I gotta I gotta tell you look obviously
01:26:13.20 --> 01:26:17.52 I'm from Texas water burgers are all over the place and water burgers are awesome you can't
01:26:17.52 --> 01:26:22.64 go wrong with the water burger um in and out is uh it's pretty tough to be though it's uh there's
01:26:22.64 --> 01:26:27.68 something special about the internet I used to have you know over Pacific Beach I had a storage unit
01:26:27.68 --> 01:26:33.44 over there and there's like my storage unit was like right in and up or a hill those are good burgers
01:26:36.96 --> 01:26:42.32 the uh my storage unit was it would like kick the exhaust or like right back up into
01:26:42.32 --> 01:26:48.48 and so so like the exhaust blasting in your face you know from like 25 yards 30 yards away
01:26:48.48 --> 01:26:54.000 as I'm like there at my storage unit on the server for whatever and I was like double double we're
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.56 getting some double double so yeah internet is awesome it's it's tough to beat I'm a huge fan
01:26:58.56 --> 01:27:04.56 internet I will say this though where's the meat man come on those burgers you gotta put
01:27:04.56 --> 01:27:09.60 what a burger you gotta a lot more more patty yeah well apparently you're not a working in the triple triple
01:27:09.60 --> 01:27:16.24 that's what we need quadruple quadruple yeah that's what we got there my my kids after they
01:27:16.24 --> 01:27:22.32 would cut weight for wrestling season I spent more money in an out burger during wrestling season
01:27:22.32 --> 01:27:26.32 because after they cut weight and then they rest all day and then you're going home and all they
01:27:26.32 --> 01:27:32.08 want to do is go in an out burger in an out burger yeah it's it cutting weight for me is the
01:27:32.08 --> 01:27:36.40 very I mean playing football is like maybe one of these big and fabulous plastic and this is
01:27:36.40 --> 01:27:42.64 crush food yeah check all right speaking of well like a speaking of combat sports
01:27:42.64 --> 01:27:51.52 next question six this is your jitz of question should instructors not teach white belts
01:27:53.36 --> 01:27:59.04 aka lathe babbin david berk and jp to nail that's cold blood it's a good deal to you that is
01:27:59.04 --> 01:28:08.000 good deal to you they should instructors not teach white belts certain techniques or should
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:14.56 why they shouldn't do them be explained but still expose the white belts to techniques
01:28:14.56 --> 01:28:19.12 set the white belts recognize them so there's some techniques that you don't get taught very often
01:28:19.12 --> 01:28:26.40 as a white belt for instance a heel look I believe that it is good to not teach people a
01:28:26.40 --> 01:28:33.76 teach white belts to do heel hooks because the for example heel hooks can be very dangerous
01:28:33.76 --> 01:28:39.36 the reason that they're dangerous because they don't hurt a lot before they injure you and so white belts
01:28:39.36 --> 01:28:46.48 who are by nature completely insane and going crazy and going nuts and so when they get a
01:28:46.48 --> 01:28:49.68 hold of something they just go as hard as they can and by the way they're usually going against the
01:28:49.68 --> 01:28:51.84 white belt that's the only reason they're getting anything on them because they're going
01:28:51.84 --> 01:28:55.28 against white belt and that other white belt's going completely insane and he's not going to tap
01:28:55.28 --> 01:29:03.60 and so what happens you get the triple triple lindi right ACL MCL PCL tear game over
01:29:03.60 --> 01:29:07.92 this guy's never trained in jjitsu again or this guy's not trained in jjitsu for two years or
01:29:07.92 --> 01:29:17.36 whatever so is it smart to not teach them yes it is however dichotomy balance should you just
01:29:17.36 --> 01:29:22.40 never show them what they are no you should you should explain to them hey this is what the move is this is
01:29:22.40 --> 01:29:26.96 this is why we don't teach them this is why we don't teach them because you can get hurt
01:29:26.96 --> 01:29:29.68 and when you get a little bit more advanced and you learn to relax a little bit more we'll teach
01:29:29.68 --> 01:29:34.72 you some of these these techniques that are slightly more dangerous do you know he's freaks out because
01:29:36.16 --> 01:29:42.64 saying that a heel hook is more dangerous than a then a comira I mean if you ask me what I want
01:29:42.64 --> 01:29:47.20 to have somebody just go berserk on a cus cumira on me or a heel hook I'd probably pick the heel
01:29:47.20 --> 01:29:53.28 hook right because then you you still have shoulder mobility whereas cumira that's that's just
01:29:53.28 --> 01:29:57.52 if someone goes nuts on a cumira and just rip your arm up your shoulder apart what would you
01:29:57.52 --> 01:30:04.48 rather have yeah I'm thinking to put all day long so but for some reason it's kind of a rough choice
01:30:04.48 --> 01:30:09.04 there that is a rough choice that is a rough choice that's not a choice you want to be making
01:30:09.04 --> 01:30:13.84 because either one of them's not good but I think you can do a better job of replacing the knee
01:30:13.84 --> 01:30:19.92 and getting the knee squared away then you can the shoulder there's no the shoulders tough but for
01:30:19.92 --> 01:30:24.32 some reason the cumira is everyone you're learning cumira day one right day three you're learning
01:30:24.32 --> 01:30:30.72 cumira and you could definitely trash someone shoulder but it hurts it does hurt been that's
01:30:30.72 --> 01:30:35.36 beneficial yeah I need the shoulders gonna have a way more flexibility than your little your knee
01:30:36.08 --> 01:30:40.32 twisting joint you like that's that you can't be like hey I'm so I'm gonna let you get some
01:30:40.32 --> 01:30:46.32 jump double jump to your knees of bone and you actually right show you guys who can you
01:30:46.32 --> 01:30:51.68 shoulder you know just varying levels of shoulder flexibility and then that also goes for like the
01:30:51.68 --> 01:30:57.12 pain tolerance as well knees last way less from from a wide bill perspective there's so much
01:30:57.12 --> 01:31:02.000 to to learn I mean it's you know and the more I train the more I realize how little I actually
01:31:02.56 --> 01:31:08.24 know and how much more there is that I mean why I would I would I would I would rather focus on you know
01:31:09.12 --> 01:31:14.80 on the more the more foundational aspects of the game and until I can get those a little bit better
01:31:14.80 --> 01:31:18.72 I think that makes a lot of sense to me I think you might be the bull white belt right now of the
01:31:18.72 --> 01:31:26.40 world so in the in the navy the ensin which is the lowest ranking ensin at a ship or a seal
01:31:26.40 --> 01:31:32.56 team he gets called the bull ensin which means he's been the junior guy for the longest amount of
01:31:32.56 --> 01:31:37.36 time and you've been trained she's your footer quite some would you well you start training with me
01:31:37.36 --> 01:31:44.24 in 2005 right yep can you train before me with Fabio I train a few times okay so you've been trained
01:31:44.24 --> 01:31:53.04 since oh three oh four that's been a long time bro most of that's 14 years most of that 14 years
01:31:53.60 --> 01:31:58.16 I'd say I've been seriously training for you know probably probably like back at it you know
01:31:58.16 --> 01:32:03.60 pretty consistently you know multiple times a week for year and a half okay so yours year in
01:32:03.60 --> 01:32:08.32 the zone you're in the zone you be getting that blue belt you at some point Todd White down in Texas
01:32:08.32 --> 01:32:13.28 I'm gonna crack it out possibly I don't know maybe you're not ready though I'll make my dad wait
01:32:13.28 --> 01:32:18.80 Todd White I'm definitely not ready he's the good you going no you got nothing you got nothing
01:32:20.16 --> 01:32:27.12 check so yeah that's I think the deal same thing with same thing uh the other problem with teaching
01:32:27.12 --> 01:32:32.000 a person for instance he'll hooks is then they think that that's the solution to the guard
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:40.08 and it's not the solution to the guard it's a solution to the guard it's a one possible one one
01:32:40.08 --> 01:32:45.36 one small possible one a solution there's many many more and there's others as you said
01:32:45.36 --> 01:32:53.44 life that are more fundamental so it's that's my that's my answer yeah that thing um how you say
01:32:53.44 --> 01:32:59.68 the like let them know what it is yeah and well when you consider an actual typical White belt class
01:32:59.68 --> 01:33:04.40 they hook it's probably not gonna be introduced in any significant capacity yeah at all like no one's
01:33:04.40 --> 01:33:09.92 gonna choose to spend time in a White belt class to teach a hill yeah typically is not gonna happen
01:33:09.92 --> 01:33:14.32 but like the control thing right like you know you get a even a good blue belt is been in for a
01:33:14.32 --> 01:33:19.20 long time per belt up purple belt and up they're gonna know the control on a hill hook like if I
01:33:19.20 --> 01:33:24.80 you know purple belt doesn't heal hook on you the risk of you getting injured unless you don't
01:33:24.80 --> 01:33:29.20 tap or something like that is pretty low it's gonna be pretty low because they know that control of just
01:33:29.20 --> 01:33:33.44 their whole body and you don't know you should tap exactly right yeah so the White belt they don't
01:33:33.44 --> 01:33:39.84 even have control very important they don't have control or they have a lot less control in everything
01:33:39.84 --> 01:33:45.36 by the way there's a strong possibility there's a strong person but that's with everything like
01:33:45.36 --> 01:33:52.32 even on a defending a take down it's like so odd a couple as a blue belt I heal hook to a friend of mine
01:33:52.32 --> 01:34:01.92 and I heard him and I didn't it wasn't even he was he was a no nothing right and we're going and
01:34:01.92 --> 01:34:07.52 I just started learning hill hooks and I put a hill hook on him and we were overseas and I put a hill
01:34:07.52 --> 01:34:12.08 hook on him and he wasn't tapping and I was kind of like well that's weird you know why is
01:34:12.08 --> 01:34:16.08 he tapping so I went a little bit harder and then all of a sudden there was a little pop and I let
01:34:16.08 --> 01:34:23.12 go and I was like and yeah but you know he was a seal and so he was like all this is gonna work on me
01:34:23.12 --> 01:34:27.84 he doesn't hurt and all of a sudden so I I wasn't going nuts because like I said I was a blue belt
01:34:27.84 --> 01:34:35.92 I was in pretty good control but even I didn't realize at that time oh this will injure him before it will
01:34:36.72 --> 01:34:42.88 cause pain which is a bad thing to have yeah these kids I mean he's guys if they're
01:34:42.88 --> 01:34:48.48 no one has control over anything by the way any any other moves and they're doing hill hooks as a
01:34:48.48 --> 01:34:52.72 normal thing like oh yeah we do we got taught this and stuff and it's effective you know like a
01:34:52.72 --> 01:34:57.84 lot of submissions and hill hooks and a lot of foot locks are one of those ones where you to gain
01:34:57.84 --> 01:35:03.28 the position to go for that submission you have to work a lot less than like an arm bar where you
01:35:03.28 --> 01:35:07.52 have to actually pass someone's guard and you know getting even side control but a lot of times get
01:35:07.52 --> 01:35:11.60 to the you know you got to work more to get into the position with hill hooks not not not so much
01:35:11.60 --> 01:35:17.84 like that so if you know yeah you can just throw it out there and you throw in the lack of control yeah
01:35:17.84 --> 01:35:26.48 man so you increase the chance for injury for sure all right next question I am a 66 year old
01:35:26.48 --> 01:35:35.12 police chief and CrossFit athlete is your muster doable for me absolutely there'll be plenty of
01:35:35.12 --> 01:35:42.24 people who are in your age group and there's no question that you should come and join us for
01:35:42.24 --> 01:35:47.44 monster get after if you're your police chief across for athlete you can more more than get after
01:35:47.44 --> 01:35:54.64 with the the 445 club workouts are voluntary we usually have I mean we probably have what you know 80
01:35:54.64 --> 01:35:59.68 85% of our participation I mean is massive but they're they're designed so that really anybody can
01:35:59.68 --> 01:36:04.48 do we have people with top level athletes down to you know folks who look like the private
01:36:04.48 --> 01:36:09.36 men of the gym hold on yeah we have the fact you started to get so I remember one guy that was
01:36:09.36 --> 01:36:13.76 I'm heading in for doubled knee surgery in a week and so I'm just and he was an older guy you know
01:36:13.76 --> 01:36:19.44 then had been out of the gym for a bit and he was out there like you said that the the workouts are
01:36:19.44 --> 01:36:26.72 scaleable to the individual that's participating in the in the event and so we at all every level
01:36:26.72 --> 01:36:30.72 you can come to the monster in any literally in any physical condition you can come to the
01:36:30.72 --> 01:36:41.36 monster and you can you can get after it with us next question I find meetings of greater than
01:36:42.24 --> 01:36:51.28 or equal to eight people far less productive than smaller groups even with structured action
01:36:51.28 --> 01:37:03.12 oriented agenda is there a maximum amount of people you'd involve in a strategic or tactical planning group
01:37:03.52 --> 01:37:06.80 I don't think I don't think there is a maximum amount I think it just has to be controlled
01:37:06.80 --> 01:37:11.20 and you've got to have you've got to have some decentralized command or people understand if there's
01:37:11.20 --> 01:37:16.96 just a bunch of people that meeting and everyone's kind of speaking in turn and talking over
01:37:16.96 --> 01:37:19.44 each other you're not going to get anything done so you got to have there's got to be one
01:37:19.44 --> 01:37:24.48 leader who's run that there's got to be some some you know some other subordinate leaders that
01:37:24.48 --> 01:37:29.52 and one person has got to drive that meeting and make sure that when someone starts going
01:37:29.52 --> 01:37:34.80 in down a rabbit hole okay you guys have a sidebar conversation afterward let's keep this meeting
01:37:34.80 --> 01:37:40.48 focused and let's and ultimately the decision maker who can focus the team on a single course of action
01:37:40.48 --> 01:37:45.20 get her by behind them I agree and there's certainly times where you can bring too many people
01:37:45.20 --> 01:37:48.96 into trying to figure something out I mean that can certainly happen and we we have the good idea
01:37:48.96 --> 01:37:52.24 fairies that keep coming around with their good ideas and cause I don't know what if we did this
01:37:52.24 --> 01:37:56.48 I wonder if we did that there's also an interesting dynamic that you just pointed out that ties into a
01:37:56.48 --> 01:38:02.32 question that we had earlier or something that we were talking about earlier which is okay so let's
01:38:02.32 --> 01:38:08.32 say we have a meeting and there's 15 people in that meeting if the leader of that meeting then
01:38:08.32 --> 01:38:17.60 we'll say steps down into the position of being the the director of the meeting itself
01:38:18.80 --> 01:38:22.96 he guess what he's doing all the time he's talking he's pulling things he's get and what he's doing
01:38:22.96 --> 01:38:27.44 while he's doing that is he's getting in the weeds of what's going on so as he's getting in the weeds
01:38:27.44 --> 01:38:32.96 of what's going on he's losing this strategic vision and so if there's 20 people in a meeting
01:38:32.96 --> 01:38:36.08 and you as the leader are going okay what do you think what do you think what do you think
01:38:36.08 --> 01:38:41.84 and hey no let's get it focused when you're doing all that traffic copying you're actually
01:38:41.84 --> 01:38:46.32 losing your strategic altitude you're not going to be able to see and make a good clear decision
01:38:46.32 --> 01:38:53.76 so if there's 30 40 50 people in a meeting and you as the leader get down in the weeds
01:38:53.76 --> 01:38:58.40 and get down in the trenches and you start throwing down with everyone well it's not going to take
01:38:58.40 --> 01:39:02.96 very long well you're just you're just one of the troops and you don't see anything where is if you
01:39:02.96 --> 01:39:08.32 let let one of the other leaders let one of the subordinate leaders let them step up let them start to
01:39:08.32 --> 01:39:12.88 do their thing let them do the direction of the meeting you might even tell them hey run this meeting
01:39:12.88 --> 01:39:17.92 I would do that I'd be like hey you run this meeting and then you let them get in there and the
01:39:17.92 --> 01:39:22.40 trenches and let them try and sort out ideas and they're mind gets filled with a bunch of crap and meanwhile
01:39:22.40 --> 01:39:27.52 you're in the meeting you're just not running it so there's a big difference between running the meeting
01:39:27.52 --> 01:39:32.56 and overseeing the meeting or being in the meeting or being a leading leader of the meeting so
01:39:32.56 --> 01:39:37.20 if we're going through a kill house or if we're going if we're going through a kill house that's a
01:39:37.20 --> 01:39:40.72 good example which is the you know the room with the building with a bunch of rooms and it if
01:39:41.36 --> 01:39:47.60 as the leader you don't say hey I'm gonna run this kill house I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
01:39:47.60 --> 01:39:51.20 direct the movement through the kill house because then guess what you're doing you're directing
01:39:51.20 --> 01:39:56.72 the movement through the kill house what you want to do is take a step back and say hey you
01:39:56.72 --> 01:40:03.52 third, fourth, fifth in the chain of command you run this kill house you run the train and now
01:40:03.52 --> 01:40:08.000 that guy goes okay cool I got it and now while he's running the train doing the work you're
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.80 step back and out too you can see what's going on you can hear the frustration you can hear
01:40:12.80 --> 01:40:18.32 shots fired you know where people are moving then you become you're the real leader so
01:40:18.32 --> 01:40:22.64 same thing in a meeting the dynamics of the meeting or you get more than 10 people 15 people
01:40:22.64 --> 01:40:26.48 and what you're doing is you're down there directing traffic it's gonna be really problematic
01:40:26.48 --> 01:40:33.20 for you if you have a meeting with 15 or 20 people and you tell someone else to direct the meeting
01:40:33.20 --> 01:40:38.96 and run the meeting and you take a step up and you simply observe you're gonna have a better time
01:40:41.04 --> 01:40:45.52 feeling like the meeting is effective and you will get the benefit of hearing all these different
01:40:45.52 --> 01:40:50.16 voices which is good which is good to hear all these different opinions and voices and be able to pick
01:40:50.16 --> 01:40:55.28 through and sort through and that's gonna give you more benefit than you know what I get there's
01:40:55.28 --> 01:40:58.96 two it's going on this meeting only give me two people and we'll make the decisions well there's
01:40:58.96 --> 01:41:04.40 some people number number the six person that person had a good input right the 12 person might
01:41:04.40 --> 01:41:09.68 had some good input so again is there balance yes are there certain decisions that you kind of
01:41:09.68 --> 01:41:16.56 need to take and really dive down in with a small group absolutely but is it good sometimes to let
01:41:16.56 --> 01:41:21.44 things air out and let someone run a meeting and you listen and you learn kind of what the overall
01:41:21.44 --> 01:41:27.68 atmosphere is in the situation are absolutely that's my answer I think it's a great one it helps
01:41:27.68 --> 01:41:32.16 people it helps people listen to you as well right I mean when if you're the boss and you're just
01:41:32.16 --> 01:41:35.52 sitting back and you're not saying anything and then all of a sudden you're like hey guys we're
01:41:35.52 --> 01:41:40.16 getting way off topic here this is what we need to do here's the direction we need to go got it everyone's
01:41:40.16 --> 01:41:45.12 you know back on track whereas if you're in the middle of it then yeah people are just automatically
01:41:45.12 --> 01:41:47.84 you know kind of doing there I'm sure we said this before and I know we talked about it really
01:41:47.84 --> 01:41:52.64 to be like when I would say something on the radio and task unit bruiser when I would say like a
01:41:52.64 --> 01:41:59.60 legitimate thing man it would happen if I got on and said everyone get the building 34 now people would
01:41:59.60 --> 01:42:04.16 go and one of my favorite things to do one of my favorite conversations to have on the radio
01:42:04.16 --> 01:42:10.64 with with either you or stoner was like I remember you'd be like you'd say hey Jocco we got another
01:42:10.64 --> 01:42:15.20 mover where I want to take down building 34 and I'd come up and go do it that was all I'd ever
01:42:15.20 --> 01:42:21.28 said be like do it and I just like go because I'm not trying to talk right I got these guys got
01:42:21.28 --> 01:42:26.40 their situation tandled hey he's going outside of something that we planned hey Jocco want to
01:42:26.40 --> 01:42:32.64 build a move to building 34 and take that thing down do it not well why do you want to do that you
01:42:32.64 --> 01:42:35.84 know why he wants to do it because he's got a good reason he's not asking me that because it's a
01:42:35.84 --> 01:42:40.24 fantasy that he thinks it's going to be cool no there's a reason and he'll explain that to me later
01:42:40.24 --> 01:42:44.48 and if it was something where he's like I want to you know start doing jumping jacks out here
01:42:44.48 --> 01:42:49.36 then I might ask why because that doesn't make my sense to me but to say hey we're hitting
01:42:49.36 --> 01:42:54.96 building 34 as well what if we were doing burpees with that make more sense that makes a little
01:42:54.96 --> 01:43:01.20 more sense little more sense than jumping jacks look that that actually worked it worked for us
01:43:01.20 --> 01:43:05.84 when you when you said some of the radio like got it we're good like it the decision made
01:43:05.84 --> 01:43:12.96 everyone's on board and I think it's it's something that you've got to you've got to focus on
01:43:12.96 --> 01:43:16.64 with like when a leader talks it should matter and and I think you can be you got to be really
01:43:16.64 --> 01:43:21.68 careful about that and I've certainly been a chief violator that of like going off a two to
01:43:21.68 --> 01:43:26.64 too many different directions but that you did extremely well at Tassian bruiser and it works
01:43:26.64 --> 01:43:30.88 and every later should be very Congress of them yeah the last you talked the more people listen
01:43:30.88 --> 01:43:42.40 all right next in a in a middle management position what's the best way to support the company
01:43:42.40 --> 01:43:50.08 and leadership you work for while still showing your fellow workers they are supported and appreciated
01:43:51.12 --> 01:43:56.16 I work in surgery at a large hospital within even larger corporation
01:43:58.72 --> 01:44:03.12 this is one of those things and I remember saying I'm sure I got this from hackworth but it's one of
01:44:03.12 --> 01:44:08.48 those things that I've said so many times I actually probably forget to even give credit to hackworth
01:44:08.48 --> 01:44:13.12 but you know when problems little problems would arise up the chain of command and I'd be like
01:44:13.12 --> 01:44:19.36 everyone hates the echelon of command above them right that's the way it is like and that's just
01:44:19.36 --> 01:44:23.52 the way it is that's the way it is it's always they don't get it so they don't understand
01:44:24.56 --> 01:44:29.60 unless you get somebody that really knows how to explain and communicate down the chain of
01:44:29.60 --> 01:44:33.52 commands that everyone understands why they're doing what they're doing that's what this is that's
01:44:33.52 --> 01:44:38.08 exactly what this is like if it what's the best way to support the company leadership it's to
01:44:38.08 --> 01:44:43.60 take what the company and the leadership of the company says and translate it to the troops
01:44:43.60 --> 01:44:49.84 in a way that they understand and that means something to them right so you go to a big meeting
01:44:50.88 --> 01:44:57.04 and you know like let's say in all hands meeting for a company and and the CEO is saying
01:44:58.64 --> 01:45:03.68 hey we made you know we made 87 million dollars last year profit and if all the front line
01:45:03.68 --> 01:45:12.64 troops are in there they're like well that's cool but I didn't see that reflected in my pay
01:45:12.64 --> 01:45:18.000 check by the way you gave me a $4 raise over the last three years how about some of that 87
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:24.40 million kick it down to the people so that's problematic because we aren't explaining hey good that's
01:45:24.40 --> 01:45:29.12 it that literally that statement right there will actually make people mad the the the the CEO's
01:45:29.12 --> 01:45:33.12 thinking everyone's gonna love me because I'm telling how profitable we are as a company all
01:45:33.12 --> 01:45:36.56 everyone's thinking as a little bit why can't you afford to buy me that piece of gear that we
01:45:36.56 --> 01:45:41.76 need on the front lines what's your problem that's so you actually think you're helping but you're
01:45:41.76 --> 01:45:46.16 actually hurting unless you can explain to people look we made this much profit here's how it's
01:45:46.16 --> 01:45:51.68 gonna benefit us as a company and you as a front line troop by us making this much money it means
01:45:51.68 --> 01:45:55.36 we can grow these areas it means we can bring on more people that means everyone in this room right
01:45:55.36 --> 01:45:59.92 now in the next three years you're gonna have an opportunity to be in a leadership position that's
01:45:59.92 --> 01:46:03.20 why I'm talking about that's why we're trying to grow that's why we're trying to do better by the way
01:46:03.84 --> 01:46:07.76 as we this is snowballing even more because now we're putting more money into advertising we've got
01:46:07.76 --> 01:46:11.20 whole advertising campaign that's going out we've invested a bunch of money in that and it's gonna
01:46:11.20 --> 01:46:15.76 bring us more business and that means the jobs that you think might not be stable your job if you
01:46:15.76 --> 01:46:21.44 don't think it's stable it just got stable because we have the capital to get this machine moving
01:46:21.44 --> 01:46:28.40 even faster so when you do that when you explain to the troops why something's happening it makes
01:46:28.40 --> 01:46:35.36 them understand and it shows your people hey you're supporting are there times where you should push back
01:46:35.36 --> 01:46:40.64 yes there are and if something makes no sense whatsoever you should raise your hand it's hey
01:46:40.64 --> 01:46:44.80 let me let me let me run this up the chain of command let me run this up the chain of command and
01:46:44.80 --> 01:46:49.12 explain why this is in a good idea and that way you can go and when you get the reason because they'll
01:46:49.12 --> 01:46:53.44 be a reason and it might not be the best reason but it'll be a reason and you go back to troops and
01:46:53.44 --> 01:46:57.52 say hey here's why this is going on this is what's happening this is the decision they made
01:46:57.52 --> 01:47:02.72 and you know what we're gonna do our best to execute it because that's what we do we make things happen
01:47:02.72 --> 01:47:08.88 we're gonna get it done boom and we got a great we've got a great depiction of that in
01:47:08.88 --> 01:47:13.92 and talking about being humble not passive and pushing back where it matters in the deck out of
01:47:13.92 --> 01:47:18.88 me leadership that's that whole section is talking exactly about that it's a very hard thing
01:47:18.88 --> 01:47:23.20 you know for people and that the the basis of this question though is the us versus them right front
01:47:23.20 --> 01:47:29.28 lines versus corporate headquarters and you've got to defeat that if you're a good leader you
01:47:29.28 --> 01:47:34.24 got to recognize look we're all the same team we can't do what we need to do without having the
01:47:34.24 --> 01:47:41.76 support and you know the resources and the approvals a plans from the corporate headquarters you know
01:47:41.76 --> 01:47:47.36 and corporate headquarters it oftentimes so not only are is there frustration up the chain there's
01:47:47.36 --> 01:47:50.88 also frustration down the chain you hear that all the time like will the front lines it will
01:47:50.88 --> 01:47:55.44 really get it they don't get it over there well listen from the front lines is where the actual
01:47:55.44 --> 01:48:00.24 mission gets one lost yeah so you you've got to you might want to have them on board with the
01:48:00.24 --> 01:48:04.08 big example so you got to make sure that you know that it's got to if you want to successful team
01:48:04.08 --> 01:48:10.72 you you can't have us versus them ever to get on board for the big win yeah the full metal jacket
01:48:10.72 --> 01:48:15.60 right what's your problem son once you get on board for the big win and and you think oh well
01:48:15.60 --> 01:48:19.20 if i'm the general and i'm telling this young guy that's got a peace sign on this helmet
01:48:19.20 --> 01:48:24.40 that represents the dichotomy maybe that's where i learn the word dichotomy from that represents the
01:48:24.40 --> 01:48:29.52 dichotomy of what does he say that dichotomy again he says the duality of duality of man yeah
01:48:29.52 --> 01:48:34.24 you're right that represents the duality of man what did you take that thing off and get on board
01:48:34.24 --> 01:48:39.04 for the big win and that's such a great line from that move join the team son get on board for the
01:48:39.04 --> 01:48:42.64 big win that's such a great line from that movie because that's exactly what we're talking about
01:48:42.64 --> 01:48:48.000 that does absolutely nothing for that front line soldier that goes okay you're saying that
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:53.76 and i'm literally bearing people right now in this situation and so for you saying that to me means
01:48:53.76 --> 01:48:58.64 nothing in fact it shows how completely freaking out a touch you are and so they did a great job
01:48:58.64 --> 01:49:03.12 in that movie of representing that through one single line it won't just get on board for the
01:49:03.12 --> 01:49:13.20 big win it's like no actually why don't you lead how does that sound so communicate up and down
01:49:13.20 --> 01:49:19.76 jinnic man make sure people know why and tie in why it matters to them next question
01:49:22.40 --> 01:49:27.68 in extreme ownership you talk about being close with the team but not so close that they forget
01:49:27.68 --> 01:49:34.64 who's in charge or that the good of the team suffers how do you overcome the isolation of leadership
01:49:34.64 --> 01:49:44.88 what strategies did or do you employ to avoid the isolation becoming an issue this is an example
01:49:44.88 --> 01:49:51.20 of i'm gonna take this to the extreme hey i'm not gonna be too close to my people guess what i'm
01:49:51.20 --> 01:49:55.68 not talking to them right i'm not gonna speak to them i'm gonna i'm gonna maintain a distance
01:49:55.68 --> 01:50:00.000 i'm gonna and it's it's obviously not true it's obviously not true and i think you know
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:07.60 the the relations that you and me and Seth and the that we all had was clearly uh this right
01:50:07.60 --> 01:50:13.28 i wasn't alone i wasn't isolated as the leader because we were all bros and hanging out and
01:50:13.28 --> 01:50:17.92 now didn't start off like that no you know i as we always talk about like i come across a hack
01:50:17.92 --> 01:50:21.84 worth style of like hey we're not gonna joke around for at least whatever six to eight weeks to make
01:50:21.84 --> 01:50:28.000 sure that these dudes are good to go and that that they understand where i'm coming from and and
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:32.96 that's cool but once we get through that okay like then it's like open up a little bit then it's like
01:50:32.96 --> 01:50:36.32 open up a little bit more and then it's up a little bit more so that you're not isolated at the
01:50:36.32 --> 01:50:41.44 top because not only is it important that you're not isolated that's like that's like a marginal thing
01:50:42.16 --> 01:50:48.24 what's more important is what i talked about earlier is if you if life can't come to me and say
01:50:48.24 --> 01:50:53.84 hey man hey i don't agree with this plan or more importantly hey jockel here's what's going on
01:50:53.84 --> 01:50:57.60 with the troops right now here's what's going on with the mentality here's what's going on with the
01:50:57.60 --> 01:51:05.20 morale if he can't knock on my door and say that to me then that's a real problem because now um you
01:51:05.20 --> 01:51:11.28 know i'm i'm in the dark on what's happening inside inside with the troops which is problematic
01:51:12.56 --> 01:51:17.20 yeah i think it's this to me sounds like uh i was thinking about this question and
01:51:17.20 --> 01:51:21.36 it sounds to me like uh maybe a junior leader that was promoted at the chain because that's where
01:51:21.36 --> 01:51:24.96 you really feel like when i go from you know the assistant buto commander where i'm like kind of one
01:51:24.96 --> 01:51:30.80 of the boys and i'm you know where we can you know it's kind of uh i can kind of play interference
01:51:30.80 --> 01:51:35.52 with it with the officer and charge and the buto commander now so i get promoted it's you recognize
01:51:35.52 --> 01:51:39.92 instantly there's a little bit of difference you've got to maybe kind of distance yourself a slightly
01:51:39.92 --> 01:51:43.92 from where you were previously in recognized when you took over charlie buto and i was the
01:51:43.92 --> 01:51:48.56 buto commander when did you realize you needed to transition from being one of the boys until
01:51:48.56 --> 01:51:53.76 being the o i seen that there was that the gap was going to open up a little bit was it as soon as
01:51:53.76 --> 01:51:58.72 you took over it was pretty quick because i've been to buds uh and uh seal qualification training
01:51:58.72 --> 01:52:03.12 you know as future advanced training with uh with several guys uh and i knew these guys very well
01:52:03.12 --> 01:52:08.16 and you know i think we had a big house party hanging out you know having a good time and and
01:52:08.16 --> 01:52:12.08 uh everybody's over at my house and all of a sudden I realized some i did all the time you know
01:52:12.08 --> 01:52:16.24 as an assistant to the new commander and all of a sudden uh we're in it work you know the next
01:52:16.24 --> 01:52:21.36 week and i got to uh make some some tough calls and we got to get you know drive the standards
01:52:21.36 --> 01:52:26.08 a little bit higher where we're at and they're supposed back and you realize like okay when it's
01:52:26.08 --> 01:52:29.52 when it's time to give some people some bad news or say hey we're not doing as good as we should
01:52:29.52 --> 01:52:34.16 we need to fix that and they kind of give you the leg hey bro you know what are you doing
01:52:34.16 --> 01:52:37.76 Friday you know like then it's then you're like okay i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to distance
01:52:37.76 --> 01:52:43.20 a little bit but the the isolation you should never be isolated i think that's one thing that
01:52:43.20 --> 01:52:48.24 you know i remember coming into your office and uh i'm coming in hang out all the time in your
01:52:48.24 --> 01:52:52.88 office you know you you you come in hang out in the between space i mean i've come you know we
01:52:52.88 --> 01:52:57.12 we'd see each other in the gym we're like we're always trying to find a way to like hang out and talk
01:52:57.12 --> 01:53:02.56 and and um it was even even when you know Seth's known was all we're across the the other side of
01:53:02.56 --> 01:53:05.76 the city i mean you know we'd still connect with him and talk to him with the phone and what's
01:53:05.76 --> 01:53:12.24 well yeah well i talked about time on the uh and dvt yeah you guys you guys talk right
01:53:12.24 --> 01:53:16.32 but but haven't but even even you know yeah we'd always we he came by like we'd always
01:53:16.32 --> 01:53:20.16 try to try to get together and talk to each other and catch up with us in the chow haul or
01:53:20.16 --> 01:53:25.60 our uh you know in in the between space and you know gas like i've ever told you would come
01:53:25.60 --> 01:53:30.96 with our ad come in i'd walk in and i'd see the wind plan written up on chowco's whiteboard
01:53:30.96 --> 01:53:35.04 the task in it roser or Tony had written down all the things that we needed to do to wind and
01:53:35.04 --> 01:53:41.60 rabadi which were pretty harsh yes true but probably on the probably on the level like gangas
01:53:41.60 --> 01:53:46.48 common certainly had a great news that gangas common wind plan which you know what hey man but
01:53:46.48 --> 01:53:50.24 we are as it's marron we are we are joking laughing about that this is the relationship juggle had
01:53:50.24 --> 01:53:54.64 you know not only with me but with with with other leaders in the task unit and uh and i think you
01:53:54.64 --> 01:53:58.32 have to have that i mean you you've got to have a you've got to have a relationship with your people
01:53:58.32 --> 01:54:02.40 um you can't think that i can't talk to anyone i can't interact with anyone i think this you're
01:54:02.40 --> 01:54:07.44 gonna be unsuccessful leader um you know if if uh you try to roll that way it's just not gonna
01:54:07.44 --> 01:54:13.44 work yeah i think where you might feel what might feel like a isolation which is definitely true
01:54:13.44 --> 01:54:18.40 and this is the burden of command right like guess what you your friends with life your friends
01:54:18.40 --> 01:54:23.76 with Seth your friends with Tony your friends with these guys but at the same time like oh the burden
01:54:23.76 --> 01:54:30.16 of command is on you and it's gonna be it's gonna be you you're gonna you're gonna bear that right
01:54:30.16 --> 01:54:33.52 in your cartoon it's like hey you got your assistant to two commands you got your
01:54:33.52 --> 01:54:40.32 patron chief you got your LPO but when something goes wrong if something goes wrong if you
01:54:41.12 --> 01:54:45.84 if there's a bat if something happens on a mission it goes bad i'm not talking i'm not i'm not
01:54:45.84 --> 01:54:51.52 looking at the assistant platoon commander i'm i'm looking at you that's the burden of command that's
01:54:51.52 --> 01:54:56.08 so that thing yeah that's the there's one man that stands on the carpet right that's that's the
01:54:56.08 --> 01:55:01.28 way it works and sometimes being one man that's that's a little bit of a nice lady feeling
01:55:01.28 --> 01:55:06.16 and to help help you understand our leading petty officer charlotte batoon awesome awesome amazing
01:55:06.16 --> 01:55:10.72 CEO love the guy and uh help he could be on here one of these days but after the debut
01:55:10.72 --> 01:55:17.36 year is retirement comes one one of these days but uh he was i'm at we were we were up in
01:55:17.36 --> 01:55:26.32 navaa training and uh we took a couple days to go snowboarding which was an awesome good deal and
01:55:26.32 --> 01:55:31.68 he like we're in the vanny looks around he like sees me he's like i'm not the senior guy in charge
01:55:32.96 --> 01:55:37.04 and uh so he's screaming a laugh and about how awesome it is to nong be the senior guy because he
01:55:37.04 --> 01:55:42.000 knows the burden of command is now with me and now with him if uh guys get trouble or do something
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:48.80 we should have done yeah yeah which is while you're in toho guys getting in trouble and doing
01:55:48.80 --> 01:55:55.20 stuff stupid it's probably a fairly likely thing to have at highly valuable that's one of my
01:55:55.20 --> 01:56:01.28 favorite trips that I did multiple times yeah so that's it man build relationships and at the same
01:56:01.28 --> 01:56:06.08 time you are when you're in charge you're in charge and there's a little bit of uh that's called
01:56:06.08 --> 01:56:17.04 the burner command embrace it and we got time for one more question here you go in life and
01:56:17.04 --> 01:56:22.16 jocos opinion you've been excluded from this one echo troughs they don't want your opinion
01:56:24.32 --> 01:56:32.16 what has changed or what point do you find you need to emphasize more from when you wrote
01:56:32.16 --> 01:56:37.68 extreme ownership to now well this is a softball question that I selected he said all the
01:56:37.68 --> 01:56:42.56 easy ones well yeah I think the answer to this one's pretty obvious that's why we wrote the book
01:56:42.56 --> 01:56:49.68 that kind of a leadership I mean this is uh this is what we had needed to emphasize more and just as
01:56:49.68 --> 01:56:54.08 you know you talked about this when we were talking about jaws to you know whether now you know the
01:56:54.08 --> 01:56:57.92 sequel is gonna be as good and you know we had we had pressured a right a book he's trying
01:56:57.92 --> 01:57:02.40 to be very well like hey guys you're right in the book we didn't want to write in the book until we
01:57:02.40 --> 01:57:07.20 actually had something useful to write about that would impact leaders for the better help them be
01:57:07.20 --> 01:57:12.56 better people better leaders lead better teams lead better lives and and that's what this is type
01:57:12.56 --> 01:57:17.76 the decadent leadership answers uh the most difficult challenges and and obstacles that we see
01:57:17.76 --> 01:57:23.04 leaders face and I think that three years you know one thing that is your motion did for us is
01:57:23.04 --> 01:57:28.32 I mean our company blew up as a result echelon front we were able to work with so many more leaders and
01:57:28.32 --> 01:57:34.08 so many more companies and we got to see this over and over and over and over and over again and
01:57:34.08 --> 01:57:40.56 and this uh this is capturing those those issues uh that that we saw uh and then the solutions
01:57:40.56 --> 01:57:45.12 to solve most problems to leadership yeah I think it's gonna be pretty evident I think it was cool
01:57:45.12 --> 01:57:52.96 how it revealed itself as the subject matter of the next book I mean we we like you
01:57:52.96 --> 01:57:58.24 said business blew up yes we were busy we weren't really sitting there going okay watch the next
01:57:58.24 --> 01:58:03.44 book we read about watch the next book be about we actually we didn't even think of we weren't
01:58:03.44 --> 01:58:09.92 even thinking about it and then as we started saying you know people don't understand this as well
01:58:09.92 --> 01:58:16.80 hey we we should have added more chapters about the dichotomy we and it's like over time all
01:58:16.80 --> 01:58:22.72 of us on it became very it became completely blatantly obvious that what people needed help with
01:58:23.44 --> 01:58:29.60 was this most difficult thing which is achieving the balance of all the different dichotomies
01:58:29.60 --> 01:58:36.80 of leadership and that's why we wrote the dichotomy leadership gets on right on well or
01:58:36.80 --> 01:58:42.40 just hitting that two hour mark which means we only have two hours for echo to talk about support
01:58:42.40 --> 01:58:50.24 you said echo was a school for that last question but I want to know what your answer is echo
01:58:50.24 --> 01:58:55.84 from uh oh yeah what you've learned since extreme ownership comes out since the podcast is launched
01:58:55.84 --> 01:59:02.88 okay so the the main thing that sticks out main thing is that is what people seem to ask you all
01:59:02.88 --> 01:59:07.36 the time is what do I do when other people aren't taking extreme ownership and here's thing when
01:59:07.36 --> 01:59:11.36 you're outside and listening you're like a high see what you know it's almost like a funny
01:59:11.36 --> 01:59:15.60 question right because like what what do you call that like ironic right kind of or they're like what
01:59:15.60 --> 01:59:20.40 do you do when other people but it's you the one supposed to you know so that's it but the reason
01:59:20.40 --> 01:59:25.12 that that significant is because when you're in the situation that's exactly what it feels like you
01:59:25.12 --> 01:59:31.20 can't like really see it seems to me so you got a detach which kind of kind of shed more even more
01:59:31.20 --> 01:59:38.96 light on the uh the importance of detaching right so it kind of feeds into itself but so yeah when
01:59:38.96 --> 01:59:45.36 you're in the situation and you have to essentially take ownership when the other person should
01:59:45.36 --> 01:59:50.000 be taking ownership but actually in your mind the other person hey you need to take responsibility
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:55.36 for this that's the time you gotta take responsibility of it yeah it's hard to like it's hard to
01:59:55.36 --> 01:59:59.60 really grasp that in the beginning I thought well that was pretty cool recently we got an email
01:59:59.60 --> 02:00:07.12 from a guy that's overseas running a company and he he listened to Dave Burke and and Neil did
02:00:07.12 --> 02:00:12.16 yeah good deal Dave and I think it's a great example to say can you take ownership of the weather
02:00:12.16 --> 02:00:15.36 right because the obvious answer is no I can't take ownership of the weather and I talk about this
02:00:15.36 --> 02:00:19.36 on that podcast is like well actually you can yeah because you can come over contingency plans you can
02:00:19.36 --> 02:00:25.44 come up with you can stage your force forward closer and so anyways this guy in his company
02:00:25.44 --> 02:00:31.84 it's a software type company and implementation company and they piggyback on a big giant you know
02:00:31.84 --> 02:00:37.04 one of the biggest companies in the world and that biggest company in the world one of the biggest
02:00:37.04 --> 02:00:44.40 companies in the world made some errors and it messed up their platform and they went to their
02:00:44.40 --> 02:00:50.40 clients and hey the platform got messed up it was the big guys they did this this and this wrong
02:00:50.40 --> 02:00:57.12 and the people were like oh well okay you know I guess and then he went home and he listened to
02:00:57.12 --> 02:01:03.52 that podcast and he went I screwed up because that's hey the biggest company in the world is still
02:01:03.52 --> 02:01:10.08 easier to control than the weather right and so he went back to the company and he went back to the
02:01:10.08 --> 02:01:15.84 his client and said you know what it wasn't their fault it was our fault it was my fault
02:01:15.84 --> 02:01:21.36 here's some things I'm gonna put in place so that this never happens again and all of a sudden
02:01:21.36 --> 02:01:26.80 the attitude completely changes and the client is super happy and is all of his team also because
02:01:26.80 --> 02:01:30.16 what does that do to your team when you blame when you blame the weather your team just goes okay
02:01:30.16 --> 02:01:35.04 we got a permanent excuse now whether wasn't good c's were too big when was too high cloud
02:01:35.04 --> 02:01:38.72 cover was too low whatever the case maybe you got a permanent excuse now because you can't control
02:01:38.72 --> 02:01:45.68 the weather actually wrong wrong we they control the weather we we will set up our missions we will

02:01:59.84 --> 02:02:03.60 phenomenal and here you know saying that his client was like I've never seen anyone handle a
02:02:03.60 --> 02:02:07.60 problem I guess before you guys have done an amazing job and it's it's another example of how
02:02:08.56 --> 02:02:13.76 you're you're scared to take ownership and yet by taking ownership you're building trust
02:02:13.76 --> 02:02:17.84 you're building trust and you win it when when you take ownership and you actually get the problem
02:02:17.84 --> 02:02:25.52 solve going for speaking of ownership and taking ownership maybe I could take ownership but you know
02:02:25.52 --> 02:02:34.000 support sure be happy to how to support you know people's selves sells the path really that's what
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:39.44 we're supporting the path right right on the path you're on the path all right if you're not on the path
02:02:39.44 --> 02:02:45.52 I'm well actually somebody requested a picture of just a sign that said please stay on the path yeah that's
02:02:45.52 --> 02:02:52.24 good yeah yeah exactly right and I was gonna say if you're not on the path we're not talking to you but if you're not on the path
02:02:52.24 --> 02:02:59.44 I'm I think we're talking to equally maybe more so I want to say more so but really if you're on the path
02:02:59.44 --> 02:03:04.16 when I'm talking to you super loud too so each I think I don't know maybe we'll think about that
02:03:04.16 --> 02:03:15.84 more later we'll go into origin right our company origin main dot com geese rash guard for
02:03:15.84 --> 02:03:21.60 jujitsu lathe talked about jujitsu earlier awesome stuff yeah origin makes the best stuff it's uh
02:03:21.60 --> 02:03:28.40 I've got I think I have like five different you you have the first origin guy I ever
02:03:28.40 --> 02:03:34.72 touched was yours I never echo you as well yeah interesting and I was like dang yeah it was
02:03:34.72 --> 02:03:41.52 it was it the mustard and yeah and the real when you see the weave like on the origin geese they're pattern
02:03:41.52 --> 02:03:46.40 there you can understand you're gonna get so do you have do you have currently do you have any
02:03:46.40 --> 02:03:51.76 other geese that are not origin I have three geese I have one non origin geese okay two origin
02:03:51.76 --> 02:03:58.08 go put that on took put that on and and he says like is a threat put that on see what happens
02:03:58.08 --> 02:04:02.08 boy you would have an emserious could I put on mine I was like oh should I keep this or
02:04:02.08 --> 02:04:06.32 no I put on you know one of my old house like bro I can't I can't wear this like it doesn't
02:04:06.32 --> 02:04:12.80 it's not great don't it those geese I even even at the at the white belt level I can totally tell
02:04:12.80 --> 02:04:17.68 that I roll better in my origin geese oh yes that's that's a whole button well I said that's
02:04:17.68 --> 02:04:22.24 what they felt good he's rolling bad I'm telling you no but there's someone about like the it
02:04:22.24 --> 02:04:27.84 it actually has give to my shoulders I can move in a way that like I with my other geese it's
02:04:27.84 --> 02:04:32.72 it's really tight I can't move and I feel like I don't I actually I seem to be more
02:04:32.72 --> 02:04:38.08 personal and what percentage of increased performance do you achieve wearing an origin
02:04:38.08 --> 02:04:43.92 at least 9% at least thank you no good I actually that is a good point because I had a geese
02:04:43.92 --> 02:04:47.92 like my second geese ever and I was like hey that one looks cool because it had like cool designs
02:04:47.92 --> 02:04:51.92 on it or whatever and it was like thick material for some reason I thought that beefy thick
02:04:51.92 --> 02:04:58.56 material look cool so I got it and it I'm not gonna I'm not gonna name the name of the brand
02:04:58.56 --> 02:05:03.92 so doesn't matter but um yeah when I'm rolling it it feels like more claustrophobic like with
02:05:03.92 --> 02:05:08.96 which we know you have an issue with like did before yeah back in the old days yeah did I
02:05:08.96 --> 02:05:13.28 carry you across the fact I think you were a country that took you to the cure of my class I was rolling
02:05:13.28 --> 02:05:18.96 Andy and we were on with the geese and I was trying to do like a crazy whatever
02:05:20.40 --> 02:05:25.44 lapel not lapel what's the what's the down here like the bottom part of the jacket yeah this is
02:05:25.44 --> 02:05:30.64 so I had Andy and I was trying I was almost just working something and I couldn't I didn't have
02:05:30.64 --> 02:05:37.68 enough jacket out and I was like I was pratoon like I'm an average and make you a thing for you
02:05:37.68 --> 02:05:42.08 but it was the where for him to wear him to wear him to wear a ball with yes exactly and then he was
02:05:42.08 --> 02:05:46.80 doing you know how people drag your jacket and they get between your leg on a single you know what I mean
02:05:46.80 --> 02:05:53.12 just and he's doing he's like that's his game right now and I told him I'm gonna make I have
02:05:53.12 --> 02:05:57.92 origin make a geek from the fence corner so you can grab it so we're gonna rest Taylor tier we
02:05:57.92 --> 02:06:02.56 gotta do it but that makes sense though if you roll better like if you're feeling like you're
02:06:02.56 --> 02:06:06.32 kind of straight check I'm not saying other brands feel like straight check I'm not saying that but I'm
02:06:06.32 --> 02:06:11.36 saying if you have a specific feeling while you're rolling and it's impulsively you're
02:06:11.36 --> 02:06:15.92 the fit of it makes all the troops from it and if you forget like it's not very flexible it's
02:06:15.92 --> 02:06:20.32 it's awesome and it definitely improves your game and it helps you and you look good by the way
02:06:20.32 --> 02:06:26.40 said no also speaking of looking good and feeling good and comfort they do have joggers and
02:06:26.40 --> 02:06:31.84 t-shirts and whatnot most comfortable joggers still today in my experience which is means a lot
02:06:31.84 --> 02:06:36.40 are you getting jogger to wear this jogger? I think joggers yeah even though this is going to be the
02:06:36.40 --> 02:06:43.60 undisputed champion of comfort according to kind of sorry and and rash guards I wear I wear
02:06:44.32 --> 02:06:49.68 the rash guard when I'm working out some days the days I wear it when I'm working out it's long
02:06:49.68 --> 02:06:54.000 sleeve is when I'm doing a lot of stuff on the rings so my arms don't get all chafed up which is a
02:06:54.000 --> 02:07:01.68 comfort move if you break it down just saying yeah well let me finish that let's say the results
02:07:01.68 --> 02:07:07.76 of not having the rash guard imp or impedes or gets in the way of your functionality or something
02:07:07.76 --> 02:07:13.28 like this you know you know how like like some people who wear straps or they'll wear
02:07:13.28 --> 02:07:20.16 I don't know what it oh like some of the 10 of full power lifting suit yeah yeah yeah like
02:07:20.16 --> 02:07:26.16 full thing yeah but that's more of like in it I don't know it's someone else has to put your belt on
02:07:26.16 --> 02:07:30.16 you you know what I'm saying when you're like heaving there's two or three people trying to
02:07:30.16 --> 02:07:34.56 heav the belt in a position yeah yeah I guess no I'm thinking more because like
02:07:34.56 --> 02:07:39.12 compare that to your rash guard scenario right it's like something something that's going to like
02:07:39.84 --> 02:07:43.60 you know people wear those things on their hands so they don't get blisters right so the blisters
02:07:43.60 --> 02:07:48.80 sure you could power through it but if it was measurable what it get in the way of the performance
02:07:48.80 --> 02:07:54.40 the blister if you do rip a call us which sometimes people post rip call us and and I get it like
02:07:54.40 --> 02:07:58.08 you got a good workout in but guess what your tomorrow's workout is not going to be as good
02:07:58.08 --> 02:08:01.84 especially if you think tomorrow the dead list with the rip call us from pull ups
02:08:01.84 --> 02:08:06.16 it's a bad thing you need to go back for some may it's a make sure you don't let this
02:08:06.16 --> 02:08:11.84 call us it's a good question is I'm stoked you got after it but I'm not stoked in the next
02:08:11.84 --> 02:08:16.80 day when you're like not being able to yeah so let's say they work gloves or in your case you
02:08:16.80 --> 02:08:22.16 wear the rash guards is that technically for comfort or is it for you know if you're a state
02:08:22.16 --> 02:08:28.48 functionality yeah yeah yeah I don't I don't know if I could see fit to say that I've witnessed you
02:08:28.48 --> 02:08:35.92 do anything for comfort as far as getting after it goes okay let's go on yeah keep note yeah
02:08:35.92 --> 02:08:40.56 we'll keep looking for now and also what supplements the jacquoise supplements jacquoise
02:08:40.56 --> 02:08:47.60 let's up let's see we got joint warfare we got acrylic oil we got discipline
02:08:47.60 --> 02:08:53.44 joint warfare and krill oils for your joints and now surprisingly alternate fact
02:08:56.56 --> 02:09:03.20 curcumin is also good for your brain function apparently which I could use all the help I can get
02:09:04.48 --> 02:09:10.24 you sure I just I just got an order in a new new replacement order in for some krill oil
02:09:10.24 --> 02:09:15.44 and join warfers yeah wait you're on the discipline trainer now I'm on the discipline train
02:09:15.44 --> 02:09:19.68 I get it this moment I see you got some discipline right at this moment unfortunately I lost
02:09:19.68 --> 02:09:24.96 discipline earlier yeah do this is weird lack of discipline yeah yeah like he he he he made
02:09:24.96 --> 02:09:29.52 discipline and then he lost his discipline I mixed up a huge bottle of discipline of jacquoise house
02:09:29.52 --> 02:09:33.92 and then as we were leaving the come here I'm like what the hell did I do with it I was like
02:09:33.92 --> 02:09:38.56 wait where is your discipline I think your dog is probably getting after it now just like
02:09:38.56 --> 02:09:44.88 a level 19 but you got a back though I see so that's good yeah mulk can't forget about the mulk
02:09:46.16 --> 02:09:50.96 which is the tastiest of all tasties best so this is comfort so you this is a comfort yeah
02:09:50.96 --> 02:09:56.000 yes it's a good is true and I'll be honest with you now maybe I burn myself out of meant
02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:01.36 but I've been going I've been going Richter on TV yeah and then I haven't tried these yet I
02:10:01.36 --> 02:10:04.56 will only have I've got metchak with jacquoise yet that I will go get some out of your
02:10:04.56 --> 02:10:09.28 bit so that you're okay so the chocolate or the peanut butter chocolate comes in right
02:10:09.28 --> 02:10:13.28 oh big hype we're talking about it when's it coming it's supposed to come in this one week
02:10:13.28 --> 02:10:17.44 it took what if you days later whatever big hype comes in everyone's fired up I'm one of those people
02:10:18.16 --> 02:10:23.52 so I'm like boom so I'm pounding uh chocolate peanut butter now pounding it mulk train full
02:10:23.52 --> 02:10:29.76 speed double mulk train it so after a while I'm pounding the peanut butter you know one and
02:10:29.76 --> 02:10:35.12 then I look and I still have that mint one one day I go in I'm gonna make it I see the mint one
02:10:35.12 --> 02:10:38.96 and the mint one it looked like it was looking at me like what did you forget about me you know like
02:10:38.96 --> 02:10:45.20 I was cheating on the mint like I'd left the mint you know so I put the mint one back in and
02:10:45.20 --> 02:10:54.48 I was reminded that that is my favorite one yeah yeah I but they taste good yeah see it's kind of like
02:10:54.48 --> 02:11:01.12 it's kind of like um it's it's ridiculous yeah it's ridiculous that you can just completely eat that
02:11:01.12 --> 02:11:06.48 and just enjoy it yeah my son has been posted I've been re-threading it someone's been posting like
02:11:06.48 --> 02:11:12.40 mulk recipes oh yeah and it are all these different ideas I haven't tried any of them yet because
02:11:12.40 --> 02:11:17.44 I just that's not my thing what do we just put it straight in milk oh no I just put it milk but this
02:11:17.44 --> 02:11:25.20 guy is creating like like cookies ball cookies all kinds of crazy mulk conventions and they look good
02:11:25.20 --> 02:11:31.20 and he's saying they taste good so I don't know I'll give him a try what you do is or what I
02:11:31.20 --> 02:11:38.16 wound up doing is because peanut butter is like in my opinion undiable thing in life peanut butter
02:11:38.16 --> 02:11:44.32 the flavor so the mint chocolate does so I put the peanut butter it's actual peanut butter
02:11:44.32 --> 02:11:48.48 sometimes you can mix one scoop one scoop you know peanut butter chocolate and the mint chocolate
02:11:48.48 --> 02:11:53.36 cool but you've done that oh yeah I'm not all dead that's like crossing the streams and ghost
02:11:53.36 --> 02:11:58.000 busters oh yeah and you know that's how they want the movie that's how they defeated the bed
02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:04.72 that they crosses street so yeah the cream shall stand out of there she do is you put
02:12:05.52 --> 02:12:12.80 peanut butter with the milk one that's do that report back okay if you want hey would at this time
02:12:12.80 --> 02:12:18.08 invite everyone to the immersion camp but it's sold out so I'm sorry uh sign up next year early
02:12:18.64 --> 02:12:25.60 and come hang out with us at the immersion camp check yes also good way to just to support
02:12:25.60 --> 02:12:33.44 jocco has a store it's called jocco store and this is where you can get a peril a peril school right
02:12:34.32 --> 02:12:39.92 yeah fashion is not not cool okay we're in a fashion okay cool a peril but if you want to
02:12:39.92 --> 02:12:46.08 represent it has not well we're doing all right there you go but you will look fashionable if you
02:12:46.08 --> 02:12:51.68 accept the term national jocco doesn't it yeah oh good you look good though I think I don't know
02:12:51.68 --> 02:12:55.60 that's a matter of opinion but if you want to represent that's where you can get shirts rash cards
02:12:56.40 --> 02:13:06.24 hats joccer hats namely joccer hat or flex fit where you at joccer hat see there you go dang
02:13:06.24 --> 02:13:10.88 when the flex fit oh yeah interesting I'm not against it I'm not gonna report back
02:13:11.52 --> 02:13:18.48 I want to know what sells more trucker hat or or flex fit that's an interesting question
02:13:18.48 --> 02:13:24.96 I'll find out what you're doing on that and also got a long comment about hoodies a guy from
02:13:24.96 --> 02:13:32.80 Michigan that works construction said hey jocco just let you know in Michigan we do need
02:13:32.80 --> 02:13:39.12 like wait hoodies oh boom so now I can look everything I've ever said has been disproven now this is
02:13:39.12 --> 02:13:44.48 one man's opinion yes you know well here's the thing about that when you kind of did take a
02:13:44.48 --> 02:13:49.12 step back it's like you you just went extreme you weren't wrong you just went extreme that's all
02:13:49.12 --> 02:13:56.72 you know you don't have to do the balance so this guy in Michigan he had the balance because he
02:13:56.72 --> 02:14:00.88 knows the extreme he knows about the value of the thing who he's in Michigan I gotta say for the
02:14:00.88 --> 02:14:04.56 folks in Michigan though like being up there in North Dakota doing to work like when you go to
02:14:04.56 --> 02:14:09.12 Alaska and you you know it's like pretty cool out and you got your jacket on he's looking
02:14:09.12 --> 02:14:13.68 on there's dudes like T-shirts just hanging out that's where it was it's all relative yeah so
02:14:13.68 --> 02:14:18.64 here's like two like in Maine just where I just where I have he sweatshirt all day long I mean
02:14:18.64 --> 02:14:23.28 all winter long maybe I've occasionally got to throw on some kind of a parka and you know what a
02:14:23.28 --> 02:14:29.04 park is being from Hawaii not sounds yeah so what you do with your car right on the
02:14:29.04 --> 02:14:34.32 Chalker hat flex foot debate out like flex foot I think is great I like flex flex foot hats
02:14:34.32 --> 02:14:41.12 but I will say I got a large melon and being able to adjust is important no particularly when
02:14:41.12 --> 02:14:45.36 you're fishing and you're rolling out and your hat gets blown off and it's then it's so
02:14:45.36 --> 02:14:51.52 can what are they like the largest melon I've ever seen on a human there was a guy on the special
02:14:51.52 --> 02:14:59.44 boat teams who was a great dude he was a big I'll just say Polynesian maybe he was Filipino maybe
02:14:59.44 --> 02:15:03.52 he was Polynesian I don't know but he was something like that right Pacific Islander I guess
02:15:04.48 --> 02:15:09.52 he's head was so big okay you know a protect helmet you know a protect helmet it's a
02:15:09.52 --> 02:15:15.36 protect bike helmet he had one of those for for riding in the boat for like doing operations where
02:15:15.36 --> 02:15:23.28 you got to wear helmet he had one of those and he had all the foam inside of it all of it was gone
02:15:23.84 --> 02:15:29.20 and we still had to like basically grease up his head get that thing on this and it would be
02:15:29.20 --> 02:15:34.88 it was crazy how big his head was huge and he was a great dude but he had a huge head
02:15:34.88 --> 02:15:38.64 he had no protection he just had a little thin he only wore that thing because it was a part of
02:15:38.64 --> 02:15:42.72 the rules right Pacific Islander yeah he could have just called he could have looked I don't need
02:15:42.72 --> 02:15:48.80 to helmet my freaking head helmet knife into thick get away from me I get away from the stupid
02:15:48.80 --> 02:15:54.40 helmet on people all right so he would need the flex fit you know a lot of flex in that fit
02:15:54.40 --> 02:15:58.72 he need a lot of flex in that fit I don't think the truck would fit nonetheless anyway like I said
02:15:58.72 --> 02:16:04.24 jockel store dot com so we can get all this cool my opinion cool stuff so when you made a
02:16:04.24 --> 02:16:10.16 lot of stuff too new stuff is on there yeah jockel white tea there's a shirt so my brother has a
02:16:10.16 --> 02:16:16.24 Pepsi shirt and a garbage or a garbage pale kids yes you know the little cards they're like so
02:16:17.52 --> 02:16:25.20 my twin brother jay he has a garbage pale kid shirt and you'd think as an adult you're like all right
02:16:25.20 --> 02:16:31.52 but it kind of you know it's kind of cool it's cool shirt and then you get it your Pepsi shirt like
02:16:31.52 --> 02:16:35.52 even if you don't drink pepper it just looks cool right so we got a jockel white tea shirt
02:16:35.52 --> 02:16:41.12 so that was not I thought I actually gave you credit in my mind for having an original cool
02:16:41.12 --> 02:16:44.48 because I thought I didn't think it look pretty cool it's yeah and the thing is it does the
02:16:44.48 --> 02:16:49.20 the fact is that concept is a very cool concept I didn't do it because hey Pepsi do it so let's do it
02:16:49.20 --> 02:16:53.52 that's not why I did it let's think that that that concept is cool right oh you don't jockel white
02:16:53.52 --> 02:17:00.24 tea let me get the shirt and it's a tea shirt we call those layers anyway yes some new stuff on there

02:17:14.08 --> 02:17:19.20 just subscribe that's a good way to support leave a review and you know you want your kids to listen
02:17:19.20 --> 02:17:24.08 to this podcast but you know you can't because sometimes it's completely inappropriate but for that
02:17:24.08 --> 02:17:30.000 reason we have the warrior kid podcast and that's questions from Uncle Jake or for Uncle Jake
02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:37.20 and so you can get that one to the YouTube we also have a YouTube channel that you can subscribe to
02:17:37.20 --> 02:17:41.68 hey subscribe you know what let's not do this you never watch a YouTube video and they
02:17:41.68 --> 02:17:46.08 end at the end it goes please subscribe and click whatever right click we're not going to do that
02:17:46.08 --> 02:17:50.08 yeah we're not going to do that when you think about it and I don't want to go into a whole
02:17:50.08 --> 02:17:56.96 deep thing here but it seems like as a consumer right that's it is an audience member of
02:17:56.96 --> 02:18:02.96 you or a video is whatever you and it does defeat the whole purpose of clicking like right when you
02:18:02.96 --> 02:18:06.88 like let me ask you how many people do you think get the end of a YouTube video or it says click
02:18:06.88 --> 02:18:10.96 subscribe now to watch more awesome videos how many people does that convince push them over the
02:18:10.96 --> 02:18:17.68 edge and they just can't stop that I don't know but from what I've read before it's like they
02:18:17.68 --> 02:18:23.36 recommend that like that you do that as a content creator is what they call it they say yeah
02:18:23.36 --> 02:18:27.36 hey just ask because people do it kind of thing it's kind of like hey you can't get it if you don't
02:18:27.36 --> 02:18:33.68 ask but it does kind of give you this kind of underlying feeling of like you're asking me to do
02:18:33.68 --> 02:18:39.36 something that's made to be organic it's made to be if you like this video you press like that's
02:18:39.36 --> 02:18:44.72 what that thing is made for and now you're asking me to violate that whole reason that it's made
02:18:44.72 --> 02:18:49.92 so you want me to do it like favor like you like I was watching your video because I thought we were
02:18:49.92 --> 02:18:55.04 just cool I thought we were just having a little moment right a little two minute and 30 second
02:18:55.04 --> 02:18:59.36 moments and then I get to the end of it and now you're coming out saying that I need to do this to
02:18:59.36 --> 02:19:05.92 do that this was now I see what it was it was a setup and I'm not saying that's what people are
02:19:05.92 --> 02:19:10.24 doing I'm not saying that's what you're doing if you're doing that I'm just saying as a consumer
02:19:10.24 --> 02:19:15.60 or as a viewer that's what it kind of feels like well we'll try to avoid that try to do it by just
02:19:15.60 --> 02:19:20.24 saying hey on this podcast go there and subscribe to it that way you won't get bothered with a little
02:19:20.24 --> 02:19:25.04 thing from echo at the end that says please click subscribe to watch more videos from echo
02:19:25.04 --> 02:19:30.72 child i still hear let's put it this way the most the most i'll show you say accurate for like a
02:19:30.72 --> 02:19:39.36 better term way to put it if you didn't know that we have a youtube channel we do if you didn't know
02:19:39.36 --> 02:19:45.20 you could subscribe to it boom now you do if you want to subscribe you can but that goes without saying
02:19:45.20 --> 02:19:52.48 obviously same thing with the like i like it that's a youtube that's you too grab to it yeah
02:19:52.48 --> 02:19:59.04 true also if you're working out you want to switch it up and talk about on it so on it dot com slash
02:19:59.04 --> 02:20:04.000 jockel here's a thing too which i kind of forget to say you get 10% off if you go to this slash
02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:09.12 jockel so go on it dot com slash jockel so when you're buying your kettlebells primal bells
02:20:09.12 --> 02:20:15.36 legend builds rings in you know better of stuff like that go on it dot com slash jockel so you
02:20:15.36 --> 02:20:21.36 can get 10% off really good stuff that good info is well psychological warfare is an album with
02:20:21.36 --> 02:20:26.72 tracks we're working on number two right now so we'll make that happen and i'm getting some good
02:20:26.72 --> 02:20:35.44 requests via the interwebs about what should be on there so iTunes Google Play MP3 platforms you can
02:20:35.44 --> 02:20:43.12 get that psychological warfare album with tracks but what is that for them we're not going to let
02:20:43.12 --> 02:20:46.80 you say it everybody knows what it's for what's it for don't you know what it's for yes it
02:20:46.80 --> 02:20:51.28 knows what it's for it's to combat those moments of weakness that we all have i'm going to make a
02:20:51.28 --> 02:20:59.12 cycle of track about how to not say something that has been said what do you do yeah some
02:20:59.12 --> 02:21:04.96 of course that's something that's not been said yeah beat a dead horse yeah i'm just saying if they if this is the first time they
02:21:04.96 --> 02:21:08.48 they heard it they're going to be like what is that psychological warfare i know what regular
02:21:08.48 --> 02:21:13.44 the traditional psychological warfare is it's kind of like if i kept saying hey jockel white
02:21:13.44 --> 02:21:17.44 tea oh you know what you can you can deadlift 8000 pounds and i kept saying that over and over again
02:21:17.84 --> 02:21:21.68 and never stop saying it that'd be kind of like what you're doing yeah but so it seems like it
02:21:21.68 --> 02:21:27.12 from your perspective but from the perspective someone just tuning in not just turning it over 130
02:21:27.12 --> 02:21:31.20 podcasts the here's the thing they started where if they did they'll go listen to another one they'll
02:21:31.20 --> 02:21:35.20 hear it eventually though and then they'll start to hear it over and over again but for i'm saying
02:21:35.20 --> 02:21:42.24 as an individual count which means more in my opinion okay i think it'll be said all the match yeah that's
02:21:42.24 --> 02:21:49.60 right now no we're getting that's it i like it don't get the amazons cans you can get cans people
02:21:49.60 --> 02:21:55.92 don't know this you can get cans of jockel white tea it's stop drinking other energy drinks that are
02:21:55.92 --> 02:22:00.40 filled with sugar and other crap and get yourself jockel white tea this so you know how there's
02:22:00.40 --> 02:22:05.52 these pre-workouts yeah right you know pre-workout uh thing is right it's like super like it's
02:22:06.16 --> 02:22:12.88 i don't know a pre-workout sorry but i know a pre-workout sorry you know what i'm talking about right
02:22:12.88 --> 02:22:18.88 the one they have like a bunch of caffeine whatever the label is real shiny a lot of the time
02:22:18.88 --> 02:22:21.92 you know what i'm talking about oh you know what you mean with ones that have a light label that's really
02:22:21.92 --> 02:22:26.96 shite yeah i never got a light label but i don't know a lot of that yeah all right so let me ask you this
02:22:28.32 --> 02:22:32.96 if i have a jockel white tea in a can yeah it's cold yeah right very refreshing
02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:39.44 and then i put some of that energy uh pre-workout in it since it doesn't have that much caffeine
02:22:39.44 --> 02:22:44.48 and i was maybe looking for some caffeine if i put that pre-workout stuff in the in the jockel white tea
02:22:45.36 --> 02:22:49.68 how much of a violation is that on a skill from one to ten i don't think it's a violation but
02:22:49.68 --> 02:22:54.000 i would just use discipline you can put discipline in jockel white tea but that's just another
02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:59.20 micro dose of caffeine though i don't want caffeine but i would record right oi tea that's the thing
02:22:59.20 --> 02:23:04.000 sure there's tastes got jammed up there's 60 milligrams of caffeine in jockel white tea can't
02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:09.84 that's that's enough let's say hypothetically again hypothetically one was looking for more than
02:23:09.84 --> 02:23:21.04 60 milligrams get get Greek fire okay so you know Greek fire us yeah or Greek fire from origin
02:23:21.04 --> 02:23:28.80 which has caffeine in it it's like a it's like a fat burner right so if you get that that's just
02:23:28.80 --> 02:23:34.000 caffeine in it and it'll get you it'll get you what you need all right so the violation level four
02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:40.96 yes sure i i drink a lot of coffee and a lot of caffeine and yeah that's jockel white tea's got
02:23:40.96 --> 02:23:44.96 plenty of caffeine for me it's a legit i'll tell you what i like about it with a cans of it would
02:23:44.96 --> 02:23:50.56 take care well it's been crazy hot and Texas summer yeah and just just pull it with freezing cold
02:23:50.56 --> 02:23:55.60 one out of the if i'm out of the jockel my truck that's you know 125 degrees from sitting out of the
02:23:55.60 --> 02:24:01.52 sun and crack up in a super cold roll around the road it's pretty legit you're still alive my
02:24:01.52 --> 02:24:05.04 low i got to make it you know i got to make is i got to make something that like this that you
02:24:05.04 --> 02:24:09.92 can drink before you go to bed at night oh yeah just because because i can't i mean i want
02:24:09.92 --> 02:24:14.64 some of them since seven or eight o'clock at night and i think i'm gonna crack one open but then
02:24:14.64 --> 02:24:21.44 i think now then i'll be all fired up all night yeah yeah what like you put some sort of um
02:24:21.44 --> 02:24:26.64 because there's like you know tea what he called the tea that you brew before bed makes you smell
02:24:26.64 --> 02:24:31.92 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah kind of that yeah yeah kind of a male tea oh wow you know what we got
02:24:31.92 --> 02:24:37.76 situation here let me comment in strong for the tea you made your you made your bread no
02:24:37.76 --> 02:24:41.04 tell me you don't know all about tea i didn't know about what is it camera meal
02:24:41.04 --> 02:24:47.12 yeah look at you yeah so you could take that apology right you could you could call it
02:24:47.12 --> 02:24:51.60 so we could on jockel can a meal tea oh you know you could call it that if you want yeah
02:24:51.60 --> 02:24:55.04 i would probably just call it like well i'll figure something out but i will do that
02:24:55.04 --> 02:24:59.08 because I do need something at night, warm, hot in the summertime,
02:24:59.08 --> 02:25:02.80 or hot in the wintertime, but you could drink a cold that's tasty.
02:25:02.80 --> 02:25:06.40 Because that's the thing about the, the jokalway tea is the taste is good.
02:25:06.40 --> 02:25:08.40 Like we had this, I thought we were going with this,
02:25:08.40 --> 02:25:14.76 if you had a can of jokalway tea and a can of the most sweet,
02:25:14.76 --> 02:25:19.08 like, like, doctored up thing that's supposed to taste delicious,
02:25:19.08 --> 02:25:19.92 which would you pick?
02:25:19.92 --> 02:25:23.04 I picked jokalway tea all day long because the taste is, you know,
02:25:23.04 --> 02:25:26.12 when you, you know when you realize that gatorade,
02:25:26.12 --> 02:25:28.56 no offense against gatorade, no, a little bit of offense-gure.
02:25:28.56 --> 02:25:31.36 You know when you realize that gatorade doesn't actually
02:25:31.36 --> 02:25:35.48 quench your thirst, like when you're, I don't know,
02:25:35.48 --> 02:25:38.60 I think I was 20, right?
02:25:38.60 --> 02:25:40.32 And I was real thirsty and I drank a gatorade,
02:25:40.32 --> 02:25:41.56 and I was like, why am I still thirsty?
02:25:41.56 --> 02:25:42.56 Yeah, yeah.
02:25:42.56 --> 02:25:44.68 That because there's syrup in there or whatever,
02:25:44.68 --> 02:25:46.08 doesn't work good.
02:25:46.08 --> 02:25:47.52 Jokalway tea, you get that quench.
02:25:47.52 --> 02:25:49.48 Not like it, that's a quench, go on.
02:25:49.48 --> 02:25:53.60 Well, this for back to the, or the pre workout mix
02:25:53.60 --> 02:25:57.76 in the tea scenario, this person that we're talking about
02:25:57.76 --> 02:26:01.64 didn't finish it because it did jump up the whole tea scenario.
02:26:01.64 --> 02:26:02.48 Okay.
02:26:02.48 --> 02:26:03.20 It was like a theory.
02:26:03.20 --> 02:26:03.66 Very cool.
02:26:03.66 --> 02:26:05.70 Check.
02:26:05.70 --> 02:26:07.88 There it is, boom.
02:26:07.88 --> 02:26:09.64 Jokalway tea, outstanding.
02:26:09.64 --> 02:26:12.68 Hey, books, we got way of the warrior kid books,
02:26:12.68 --> 02:26:15.40 way of the warrior kid, and Mark's mission.
02:26:15.40 --> 02:26:18.88 Those are good books for kids to read.
02:26:18.88 --> 02:26:21.16 Just talking to a teacher out in the gym,
02:26:21.16 --> 02:26:23.88 teaching the book, eighth grade, if you're wondering
02:26:23.88 --> 02:26:26.08 about how old is an eighth grader?
02:26:26.08 --> 02:26:28.12 11, 12, 11, 12.
02:26:28.12 --> 02:26:29.12 Yes.
02:26:29.12 --> 02:26:31.20 So 11, 12 year old, definitely in the same team.
02:26:31.20 --> 02:26:34.68 Sometimes when I meet someone and their kid is eight
02:26:34.68 --> 02:26:37.40 or 10, I just think your kids in the zone.
02:26:37.40 --> 02:26:40.48 And they did get so way the warrior kid and Mark's mission.
02:26:40.48 --> 02:26:43.96 I just started reading the way the warrior kid to my son.
02:26:43.96 --> 02:26:45.16 Does he get a history, right?
02:26:45.16 --> 02:26:46.96 Is he getting it?
02:26:46.96 --> 02:26:48.84 We got about 30 pages into it.
02:26:48.84 --> 02:26:49.64 He was so fired up.
02:26:49.64 --> 02:26:52.56 And he wanted to go out and disobey all of a sudden.
02:26:52.56 --> 02:26:53.08 It's funny.
02:26:53.08 --> 02:26:54.36 They get certain parts.
02:26:54.36 --> 02:26:55.20 Right.
02:26:55.20 --> 02:26:59.08 The grander kind of messages may not compute quite yet,
02:26:59.08 --> 02:27:00.44 but they'll get certain parts.
02:27:00.44 --> 02:27:02.48 So they'll like when this part comes.
02:27:02.48 --> 02:27:03.32 Yeah.
02:27:03.32 --> 02:27:04.16 It's keep doing it.
02:27:04.16 --> 02:27:05.24 Stoke to the feedback on that one.
02:27:05.24 --> 02:27:08.08 Also, just funnacles freedom field manual.
02:27:08.08 --> 02:27:11.04 It's a manual about how to get after it.
02:27:11.04 --> 02:27:13.52 And the audio version is not unautable.
02:27:13.52 --> 02:27:15.76 It's on iTunes, Amazon, music, Google play,
02:27:15.76 --> 02:27:17.56 and other MP3 platforms.
02:27:17.56 --> 02:27:19.64 So you can make it a specifically.
02:27:19.64 --> 02:27:20.64 We did that.
02:27:20.64 --> 02:27:20.84 Yeah.
02:27:20.84 --> 02:27:22.40 Maybe took a little financial hit.
02:27:22.40 --> 02:27:26.28 Whatever, want people to be able to use it as an alarm clock
02:27:26.28 --> 02:27:28.40 in their phone or a ringtone.
02:27:28.40 --> 02:27:30.36 So that's what you can do there.
02:27:30.36 --> 02:27:34.08 Those are a few books.
02:27:34.08 --> 02:27:37.88 Then we got the McGutt Extreme Ownership, obviously,
02:27:37.88 --> 02:27:40.32 which Jack went out for three years now.
02:27:40.32 --> 02:27:42.04 We have a new addition out.
02:27:42.04 --> 02:27:44.88 And of course, that caught me a leadership,
02:27:44.88 --> 02:27:46.80 which we were just talking about.
02:27:46.80 --> 02:27:49.64 And that's for it's available now for pre-order.
02:27:49.64 --> 02:27:51.48 It'll be released September 25th.
02:27:51.48 --> 02:27:52.56 Super excited about that.
02:27:52.56 --> 02:27:55.52 Looking forward to all your readers out there
02:27:55.52 --> 02:27:57.32 providing some feedback on that.
02:27:57.32 --> 02:28:01.16 And I hope this is at least as useful to you
02:28:01.16 --> 02:28:03.28 in your life's professional and personal lives
02:28:03.28 --> 02:28:04.28 as Extreme Ownership.
02:28:04.28 --> 02:28:08.72 So go get some dichotomy leadership, find the balance.
02:28:08.72 --> 02:28:13.08 You also, Dave, talk to me about the difference
02:28:13.08 --> 02:28:18.68 between first edition and let's say fifth edition of a book,
02:28:18.68 --> 02:28:21.12 which would you rather have?
02:28:21.12 --> 02:28:24.12 Which would I rather have?
02:28:24.12 --> 02:28:25.80 Yeah.
02:28:25.80 --> 02:28:27.32 I'd have to go with the first edition.
02:28:27.32 --> 02:28:28.32 That's right.
02:28:28.32 --> 02:28:29.52 That's sort of a standard.
02:28:29.52 --> 02:28:30.32 Yeah, it's the standard.
02:28:30.32 --> 02:28:31.72 Is there anyone running around going, man?
02:28:31.72 --> 02:28:32.92 I wish I had the night to this.
02:28:32.92 --> 02:28:36.04 Yeah, can't wait for that fourth edition.
02:28:36.04 --> 02:28:37.88 That is pretty cool with Extreme Ownership,
02:28:37.88 --> 02:28:41.88 with people still come up to us and have,
02:28:41.88 --> 02:28:44.20 with the, and the original paper,
02:28:44.20 --> 02:28:47.28 this was printed on was not very good for Extreme Ownership.
02:28:47.28 --> 02:28:49.32 It doesn't have the,
02:28:49.32 --> 02:28:51.24 and it doesn't have the number one New York Times best set
02:28:51.24 --> 02:28:52.08 across the top.
02:28:52.08 --> 02:28:54.24 So every once we still see some of those,
02:28:54.24 --> 02:28:55.16 you know, like, wow, that's a,
02:28:55.16 --> 02:28:57.12 that was a first printing run.
02:28:57.12 --> 02:28:58.12 I just, it's pretty cool.
02:28:58.12 --> 02:28:59.12 I just did that the other day.
02:28:59.12 --> 02:29:03.08 So a girl came up and I was signing her first edition.
02:29:03.08 --> 02:29:06.60 And there's four editions that you could possibly have.
02:29:06.60 --> 02:29:07.44 There's more than that.
02:29:07.44 --> 02:29:09.76 But the first one that came out is white,
02:29:09.76 --> 02:29:11.000 and there's no stick around.
02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.16 As soon as that made New York Times best set,
02:29:13.16 --> 02:29:14.20 they went and got stickers.
02:29:14.20 --> 02:29:15.56 It says number one New York Times best set,
02:29:15.56 --> 02:29:16.24 and they put them everywhere,
02:29:16.24 --> 02:29:18.80 because it's an advertising gig, right?
02:29:18.80 --> 02:29:22.96 But there's, so the people that got the first 10,000 copies,
02:29:22.96 --> 02:29:25.000 it's just a plain first dish.
02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:28.16 So I know there's people.
02:29:28.16 --> 02:29:30.44 And then you got, then they got the stickers on it.
02:29:30.44 --> 02:29:31.88 So you're still early.
02:29:31.88 --> 02:29:33.80 Then you got the one that actually has printed
02:29:33.80 --> 02:29:36.28 on the cover, number one New York Times best set,
02:29:36.28 --> 02:29:39.60 and then finally we get to the fourth,
02:29:39.60 --> 02:29:43.000 the fourth version, which is the black cover,
02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:44.84 back in black, which is,
02:29:44.84 --> 02:29:46.20 we have to say that one's pretty cool.
02:29:46.20 --> 02:29:47.04 It's cool.
02:29:47.04 --> 02:29:47.88 It's a different color.
02:29:47.88 --> 02:29:49.20 It's a different avenue.
02:29:49.20 --> 02:29:50.04 It's coolness.
02:29:50.04 --> 02:29:51.08 Yeah, it's a different avenue of coolness.
02:29:51.08 --> 02:29:53.48 But still the first edition,
02:29:53.48 --> 02:29:54.96 we always like the first edition.
02:29:54.96 --> 02:29:58.76 And if you, so my point is, if you want the first edition,
02:29:58.76 --> 02:30:01.16 you got to order it pre.
02:30:01.16 --> 02:30:03.000 Otherwise you're going to get some other,
02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:04.88 you'll get one that says something else on it,
02:30:04.88 --> 02:30:07.08 be all different and we'll know.
02:30:07.08 --> 02:30:07.92 What do you mean?
02:30:07.92 --> 02:30:09.000 I'll just, I'll just be,
02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.20 I'll show you what we just signed up.
02:30:10.20 --> 02:30:11.04 Yeah.
02:30:11.04 --> 02:30:11.88 That's cool.
02:30:11.88 --> 02:30:13.48 I'm glad you got in the game, eventually.
02:30:13.48 --> 02:30:15.60 Ha ha.
02:30:15.60 --> 02:30:18.52 Oh, no, I'm gonna appreciate it.
02:30:18.52 --> 02:30:21.12 That's the long front.

02:30:29.96 --> 02:30:32.68 long front is we solve problems through leadership.
02:30:32.68 --> 02:30:33.68 Everything that we wrote about,
02:30:33.68 --> 02:30:35.80 extreme ownership, all the things that we just talked about

02:31:18.96 --> 02:31:21.12 It's a leadership master, that's what it is.

02:31:29.60 --> 02:31:30.60 even earlier actually.
02:31:30.60 --> 02:31:31.44 I think so.
02:31:31.44 --> 02:31:33.24 We're way ahead of schedule,
02:31:33.24 --> 02:31:35.64 you wanna come to it extremownership.com,
02:31:35.64 --> 02:31:37.16 you can come to the Muster.
02:31:38.28 --> 02:31:42.24 And then also for our military law enforcement,
02:31:42.24 --> 02:31:44.92 firefighters, Border Patrol,
02:31:44.92 --> 02:31:48.12 Paramedics, first responders, anybody in uniform,
02:31:48.12 --> 02:31:52.52 we're launching our first ever first responder, military,
02:31:52.52 --> 02:31:56.84 uniform wearing focused leadership gathering.
02:31:56.84 --> 02:31:58.88 And this is, we're calling the roll call, roll call,
02:31:58.88 --> 02:32:01.68 here's their one, first ever is gonna happen,
02:32:01.68 --> 02:32:04.24 September 21st in Dallas.
02:32:04.24 --> 02:32:06.72 And this thing is, it was by request,
02:32:06.72 --> 02:32:10.000 we worked with so many different first responders,
02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:14.24 and fire departments and law enforcement groups
02:32:14.24 --> 02:32:17.48 and police departments, federal, state, local.
02:32:17.48 --> 02:32:22.000 We were worked with all levels of these groups.
02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:23.68 And we've had so many folks say,
02:32:23.68 --> 02:32:28.68 hey, can we have a focus leadership conference just for us?
02:32:28.68 --> 02:32:29.76 And that's what this is.
02:32:29.76 --> 02:32:33.44 So we've got several hundred people already signed up for this thing.
02:32:33.44 --> 02:32:34.76 This is for you guys.

02:32:36.88 --> 02:32:38.44 We try to make it at a price point.
02:32:38.44 --> 02:32:40.80 That was much more affordable than the Muster,
02:32:40.80 --> 02:32:43.60 so that we could, we could have as many folks attend
02:32:43.60 --> 02:32:45.24 as could come.
02:32:45.24 --> 02:32:46.68 And we hope you come from far,
02:32:46.68 --> 02:32:48.56 might be there gonna be talking about the importance
02:32:48.56 --> 02:32:51.56 of training, the importance of dealing with what you deal
02:32:51.56 --> 02:32:53.88 with every day and driving those standards
02:32:53.88 --> 02:32:58.12 and pushing your team and leading up the chain,
02:32:58.12 --> 02:33:03.12 as well as all those kind of specific law enforcement,
02:33:03.64 --> 02:33:07.44 firefighter, first responder, military focused issues,
02:33:07.44 --> 02:33:08.92 that we can really dive into.
02:33:08.92 --> 02:33:10.44 We don't have to talk about the business leader stuff
02:33:10.44 --> 02:33:12.36 because this is for you guys, that's what it's for.
02:33:12.36 --> 02:33:13.76 So if you're interested in that,
02:33:13.76 --> 02:33:15.28 if you're on the fence, if you're thinking about it,
02:33:15.28 --> 02:33:20.28 come join us for a roll call at Dallas September 21st.
02:33:21.36 --> 02:33:24.000 And of course, you've heard on this podcast,
02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:28.32 we launched a new company, a subsidiary company,
02:33:28.32 --> 02:33:31.08 to Esslon Front, it's called Esslon Front Overwatch,
02:33:31.08 --> 02:33:33.24 our EF Overwatch.
02:33:33.24 --> 02:33:38.08 And you can check that out at EFOverWatch.com.
02:33:38.08 --> 02:33:40.84 It's a great company designed to,
02:33:42.12 --> 02:33:44.76 one of the biggest things that we see
02:33:44.76 --> 02:33:46.56 from the companies who work with is people ask us,
02:33:46.56 --> 02:33:48.48 where can we get people like you?
02:33:48.48 --> 02:33:51.84 Where can we get folks from a mindset of extreme ownership?
02:33:51.84 --> 02:33:54.92 And so we started that in the Special Operations world
02:33:54.92 --> 02:33:59.12 and the goal of Overwatch is to take special operations,
02:33:59.12 --> 02:34:01.92 veterans and combat aviator veterans
02:34:01.92 --> 02:34:04.80 and place them in companies with,
02:34:06.60 --> 02:34:09.04 place them in companies who are looking for people
02:34:09.04 --> 02:34:10.40 with that mindset.
02:34:10.40 --> 02:34:13.20 And EFOverWatch is,

02:36:50.68 --> 02:36:54.48 whether you're serving food or serving warrants,
02:36:54.48 --> 02:36:56.32 whether you work in a bank
02:36:56.32 --> 02:36:58.04 or you build banks.
02:36:58.04 --> 02:37:00.28 If you wear a suit and tie
02:37:00.28 --> 02:37:03.24 or you wear coveralls and a hard hat
02:37:03.24 --> 02:37:06.84 no matter who you are and what you do
02:37:06.84 --> 02:37:09.64 do it to the best of your ability.
02:37:09.64 --> 02:37:13.40 Take pride in your work and be the best you can
02:37:13.40 --> 02:37:15.20 but at the same time,
02:37:16.48 --> 02:37:17.72 stay balanced.
02:37:18.72 --> 02:37:21.16 Be aggressive but not reckless.
02:37:21.16 --> 02:37:24.44 Take ownership but empower your team.
02:37:24.44 --> 02:37:26.76 Be humble but not passive.
02:37:28.08 --> 02:37:29.20 Be disciplined.
02:37:30.24 --> 02:37:31.44 But be free.
02:37:32.44 --> 02:37:34.76 Balance that I caught a meter ship
02:37:34.76 --> 02:37:37.40 and the dichotomies of life
02:37:37.40 --> 02:37:39.52 and as you do that,
02:37:40.72 --> 02:37:42.04 keep getting after it.
02:37:43.04 --> 02:37:45.48 And until next time,
02:37:45.48 --> 02:37:48.28 this is life and echo and jockel.
02:37:48.28 --> 02:38:05.40 Out.
