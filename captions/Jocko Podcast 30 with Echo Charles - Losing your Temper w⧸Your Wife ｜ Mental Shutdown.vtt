00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.44
This is Jocco podcast number 30.

2
00:00:04.44 --> 00:00:07.84
With that go Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

3
00:00:10.96 --> 00:00:22.32
And what we have this evening is straight Q&A, the last podcast that we did on the outstanding book

4
00:00:22.32 --> 00:00:28.52
called Boutoon Leader, a memoir of combat, of command in combat.

5
00:00:28.52 --> 00:00:32.92
It just took me a long time to get through.

6
00:00:32.92 --> 00:00:35.92
It's just a good book.

7
00:00:35.92 --> 00:00:42.32
And I just kept every time every page, I read it, I've got people got to hear that.

8
00:00:42.32 --> 00:00:43.32
People got to hear that.

9
00:00:43.32 --> 00:00:44.32
People got to hear that.

10
00:00:44.32 --> 00:00:48.52
The next thing you know, you're two and a half hours deep.

11
00:00:48.52 --> 00:00:54.08
And since so much of it was pertain to leadership, there was commentary with each section.

12
00:00:54.08 --> 00:00:56.84
And it was like, oh yeah, you know, this is what's going on here.

13
00:00:56.84 --> 00:01:01.88
And I recognize that and I wish I would have known that and that could have helped me here.

14
00:01:01.88 --> 00:01:05.72
So it went a little long.

15
00:01:05.72 --> 00:01:13.32
And that made us decide to just go ahead and turn that into one podcast.

16
00:01:13.32 --> 00:01:21.56
And now here we are coming back at you with a podcast number 30, which is straight Q&A.

17
00:01:21.56 --> 00:01:25.28
Yeah, there wasn't really one part of that book review that I was like, oh, you could have left that out.

18
00:01:25.28 --> 00:01:31.08
No, in the industry, we call that getting after.

19
00:01:31.08 --> 00:01:32.68
Indeed.

20
00:01:32.68 --> 00:01:36.28
So let's, let's take into some Q&A here.

21
00:01:36.28 --> 00:01:39.000
Some questions that we've been asked.

22
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.80
You going to kick this one off?

23
00:01:40.80 --> 00:01:41.80
Yes, sir.

24
00:01:41.80 --> 00:01:42.80
Ego Drone.

25
00:01:42.80 --> 00:01:43.80
Yes, sir.

26
00:01:43.80 --> 00:01:44.80
Question number one.

27
00:01:44.80 --> 00:01:45.80
First question.

28
00:01:45.80 --> 00:01:50.76
Jocco, as an aid decamp, what were your duties?

29
00:01:50.76 --> 00:01:52.48
What did you learn?

30
00:01:52.48 --> 00:01:56.96
And why does that position still exist in the 21st century military?

31
00:01:56.96 --> 00:01:58.28
Well, the aid decamp.

32
00:01:58.28 --> 00:02:05.28
Okay, so first of all, an aid decamp is something in the military that it's only also

33
00:02:05.28 --> 00:02:11.40
to put it in a very simple way that people could understand it from.

34
00:02:11.40 --> 00:02:12.40
It's an assistant.

35
00:02:12.40 --> 00:02:19.56
It's like an executive assistant where, for me, I was, I was the admiral that's in charge

36
00:02:19.56 --> 00:02:22.08
of all the seals.

37
00:02:22.08 --> 00:02:24.08
I was his assistant.

38
00:02:24.08 --> 00:02:26.52
You know, that's what an aid decamp is.

39
00:02:26.52 --> 00:02:33.32
Now, the question is why does that position still exist or what, you know, what did you learn

40
00:02:33.32 --> 00:02:35.48
while I learned a ton?

41
00:02:35.48 --> 00:02:36.48
No doubt about that.

42
00:02:36.48 --> 00:02:37.48
Why does the position still exist?

43
00:02:37.48 --> 00:02:39.48
I think it's absolutely necessary.

44
00:02:39.48 --> 00:02:40.48
It's not fun.

45
00:02:40.48 --> 00:02:42.48
It's not a fun job.

46
00:02:42.48 --> 00:02:44.92
And I work for a great guy.

47
00:02:44.92 --> 00:02:47.72
But if you're working for something that's not a great guy, it's miserable.

48
00:02:47.72 --> 00:02:51.80
And even working for a great guy, it's not exactly the dream job.

49
00:02:51.80 --> 00:02:52.80
It wasn't for me.

50
00:02:52.80 --> 00:02:55.44
So here's what you do.

51
00:02:55.44 --> 00:02:59.44
The boss, which is what we call, this is what we called the admiral.

52
00:02:59.44 --> 00:03:01.40
We called him the boss, right?

53
00:03:01.40 --> 00:03:06.04
So what we did was what I did was the boss is always traveling.

54
00:03:06.04 --> 00:03:11.28
I'm going different places, going to the Pentagon, going to visit outstations, going overseas,

55
00:03:11.28 --> 00:03:15.92
going just constantly going on travel and visiting people and visiting troops.

56
00:03:15.92 --> 00:03:20.12
And so I was the guy that set up that travel.

57
00:03:20.12 --> 00:03:21.12
That's what I did.

58
00:03:21.12 --> 00:03:25.52
And then, you know, communicating with whatever you're going to visit.

59
00:03:25.52 --> 00:03:27.36
Like, hey, the admiral's coming in.

60
00:03:27.36 --> 00:03:29.64
You know, what do you want us to do?

61
00:03:29.64 --> 00:03:30.84
Is there anything we need to be had?

62
00:03:30.84 --> 00:03:31.84
Zupon.

63
00:03:31.84 --> 00:03:37.92
So we take care of all that and set it up and make sure that the travel smooth.

64
00:03:37.92 --> 00:03:38.92
Because he's a really busy guy.

65
00:03:38.92 --> 00:03:39.92
It's like a CEO.

66
00:03:39.92 --> 00:03:44.32
He's like the CEO of a big giant, powerful worldwide company.

67
00:03:44.32 --> 00:03:45.32
That's what he is.

68
00:03:45.32 --> 00:03:49.32
And so you're trying to make the most of his time, make sure not wasting his time during

69
00:03:49.32 --> 00:03:50.80
travel.

70
00:03:50.80 --> 00:03:52.12
And so that's what I did.

71
00:03:52.12 --> 00:03:53.12
So that's part of it.

72
00:03:53.12 --> 00:04:02.56
And the other piece that's cool is you're kind of like an attrusted advisor or you

73
00:04:02.56 --> 00:04:04.52
try and build the trust so that he trust you.

74
00:04:04.52 --> 00:04:09.68
And they they usually, in our case, usually often try to find guys that come back from

75
00:04:09.68 --> 00:04:15.40
the front lines and use them as the aid.

76
00:04:15.40 --> 00:04:20.80
So I had when I became the aid, it was actually my commanding officer.

77
00:04:20.80 --> 00:04:27.76
He, who's a friend of mine and who's a great guy that always took care of me.

78
00:04:27.76 --> 00:04:34.44
And he told me he said, hey, my final mission as the commanding officer of Seal Team 7 is

79
00:04:34.44 --> 00:04:39.48
to make sure that you become the aid to the admiral.

80
00:04:39.48 --> 00:04:41.28
And you know, I wasn't happy about it.

81
00:04:41.28 --> 00:04:45.52
Because again, it's an administrative job.

82
00:04:45.52 --> 00:04:47.76
It's you have to wear uniform every day.

83
00:04:47.76 --> 00:04:52.52
Which was this 2005.

84
00:04:52.52 --> 00:04:59.04
And but it was, it was a good call that the that my commanding officer may be going to do

85
00:04:59.04 --> 00:05:01.72
it because I did learn a ton.

86
00:05:01.72 --> 00:05:07.48
You know, you, you, I've been in the micro world of being a seal platoon for my whole life.

87
00:05:07.48 --> 00:05:08.48
Right.

88
00:05:08.48 --> 00:05:09.48
So that's all I did.

89
00:05:09.48 --> 00:05:10.48
So you had to know anything else.

90
00:05:10.48 --> 00:05:12.000
I didn't understand anything else.

91
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.56
So when you go off a Sunday, you're dealing with not only do you see the big picture of

92
00:05:15.56 --> 00:05:20.000
the seal teams, but I saw the big picture of the army and the special operations command.

93
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.44
And big navy, like the regular navy, we interacted with them a lot.

94
00:05:23.44 --> 00:05:25.20
So I got to learn a ton.

95
00:05:25.20 --> 00:05:27.96
I learned a ton about what?

96
00:05:27.96 --> 00:05:31.64
I learned it's sort of like seeing behind the curtain.

97
00:05:31.64 --> 00:05:36.04
You know, you get to see behind the curtain of the wizard and what's going on in the chambers.

98
00:05:36.04 --> 00:05:41.08
And basically, you know, like how they make the sausage, you revert that term, you know,

99
00:05:41.08 --> 00:05:45.28
they say when they make sausage, that you'll eat the sausage, it tastes good, but you

100
00:05:45.28 --> 00:05:47.36
don't want to see how they make it.

101
00:05:47.36 --> 00:05:49.28
So that's I got to see how they make the sausage.

102
00:05:49.28 --> 00:05:51.48
I got to see behind the curtain.

103
00:05:51.48 --> 00:05:56.20
And I learned a ton of that, you know, I got to sit like there was meetings that I would

104
00:05:56.20 --> 00:06:01.64
sit in super high level meetings with very powerful people in the meetings.

105
00:06:01.64 --> 00:06:06.000
And I would just be sitting there listening and seeing how these judgments were being made.

106
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.20
And assessing the leadership and seeing what type of leaders we had at the highest levels

107
00:06:11.20 --> 00:06:13.40
of the Pentagon.

108
00:06:13.40 --> 00:06:16.16
And as I was pretty, it was pretty interesting.

109
00:06:16.16 --> 00:06:18.76
And I definitely learned a lot.

110
00:06:18.76 --> 00:06:24.72
It was not fun because like I said, there was a ton of travel.

111
00:06:24.72 --> 00:06:32.08
You're wearing a uniform all the time, which seals are pretty well known for not wanting

112
00:06:32.08 --> 00:06:34.000
to wear uniforms, real uniforms.

113
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.48
And there I'd probably worn a uniform, a very small number of times.

114
00:06:39.48 --> 00:06:42.48
I'm talking to my whole naval career, a dress uniform.

115
00:06:42.48 --> 00:06:47.28
I'd probably worn one 15 times.

116
00:06:47.28 --> 00:06:50.20
I don't know the number, but it's a tiny number.

117
00:06:50.20 --> 00:06:52.04
And I was on the mat, working for the Admiral.

118
00:06:52.04 --> 00:06:54.88
I'm wearing a uniform every single day.

119
00:06:54.88 --> 00:06:57.68
And there were sometimes we'd go on a trip and I'd have to wear, if there's multiple

120
00:06:57.68 --> 00:07:01.76
different dress uniforms in the Navy and most of the services, we'd go on some

121
00:07:01.76 --> 00:07:06.000
board I'd have to bring two or three different dress uniforms.

122
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.56
So my uniforms were always ready.

123
00:07:07.56 --> 00:07:11.56
That was one thing that not too many people could claim as you get really good at your

124
00:07:11.56 --> 00:07:15.12
uniforms.

125
00:07:15.12 --> 00:07:17.92
But there's also some things that are pretty restrictive.

126
00:07:17.92 --> 00:07:27.24
For instance, you're actually not allowed to do personal favors for the boss.

127
00:07:27.24 --> 00:07:29.76
Like I wasn't allowed.

128
00:07:29.76 --> 00:07:34.44
Is this idea, because they're very cautious that the military senior people might abuse

129
00:07:34.44 --> 00:07:36.76
people in the military?

130
00:07:36.76 --> 00:07:43.68
And like I wasn't allowed, for instance, I wasn't allowed to go pick up his laundry.

131
00:07:43.68 --> 00:07:49.84
Like if you got his uniforms pressed and clean, I wasn't allowed to go and run to the

132
00:07:49.84 --> 00:07:51.68
store and pick it up if we were going on a trip or something.

133
00:07:51.68 --> 00:07:53.44
Like it wasn't allowed to do it.

134
00:07:53.44 --> 00:07:55.88
We weren't allowed to fly first class.

135
00:07:55.88 --> 00:08:01.20
If there was only one time we flew first class, that was when we get upgrades after

136
00:08:01.20 --> 00:08:03.56
a while because we were traveling so much.

137
00:08:03.56 --> 00:08:08.76
But so both you guys couldn't, or just the AD camp.

138
00:08:08.76 --> 00:08:10.20
No, neither one of us.

139
00:08:10.20 --> 00:08:12.000
We wouldn't fly first class.

140
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.48
Yeah, it's the military sort of, you know, we don't want to, they don't want to

141
00:08:19.48 --> 00:08:21.20
be fraudwaste in abuse.

142
00:08:21.20 --> 00:08:22.72
Which is actually ridiculous.

143
00:08:22.72 --> 00:08:25.000
This guy's the equivalent of a CEO of a big company.

144
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.72
And they wouldn't get the guy first class to get stuff fly from San Diego to Washington,

145
00:08:29.72 --> 00:08:33.56
DC to go to the Pentagon and brief some senior government's leadership.

146
00:08:33.56 --> 00:08:34.96
Yeah, fully, that's a good philosophy.

147
00:08:34.96 --> 00:08:35.96
They don't waste.

148
00:08:35.96 --> 00:08:40.96
Yeah, I know it's a good philosophy, but they should have, I think he'd earn at that point.

149
00:08:40.96 --> 00:08:41.96
Right.

150
00:08:41.96 --> 00:08:43.96
30 something years in the Navy.

151
00:08:43.96 --> 00:08:47.08
Yeah, for that service, country and just be, you know, hey, you know what, this guy

152
00:08:47.08 --> 00:08:50.000
should be well rested when he shows up to brief Congress.

153
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Yeah.

154
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.40
You know, so that was that. And then the reason I think it's necessary again is because

155
00:08:56.40 --> 00:09:01.48
you got you take a guy, you know, the, the, the admiral, they're, they're not going to

156
00:09:01.48 --> 00:09:06.24
usually, you're often may not have been in recent combat situations.

157
00:09:06.24 --> 00:09:09.000
And so this aide that's coming in, he's coming off the battlefield.

158
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.84
So he can say, hey, so he was going on here.

159
00:09:10.84 --> 00:09:14.000
Hey, sir, this is what this is like, hey, sir, this is some gear that we need up on the

160
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
front lines.

161
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.80
Hey, sir, this is what the front line troopers think about this program that we're doing,

162
00:09:19.80 --> 00:09:24.56
or this rule that's being imposed upon us, we need to change this.

163
00:09:24.56 --> 00:09:26.16
So we need to get it fixed.

164
00:09:26.16 --> 00:09:29.88
So I had a great relationship with with with the boss when I was running that job.

165
00:09:29.88 --> 00:09:35.76
And it was very beneficial for me on my next appointment when I deployed Ramani.

166
00:09:35.76 --> 00:09:36.76
And I knew the admiral.

167
00:09:36.76 --> 00:09:37.76
Mm-hmm.

168
00:09:37.76 --> 00:09:41.32
I mean, it was, you know, he's the guy that's in charge of all seals.

169
00:09:41.32 --> 00:09:43.80
And there I was in Ramani.

170
00:09:43.80 --> 00:09:48.44
And you know, there was times where we talked directly, you know,

171
00:09:48.44 --> 00:09:54.92
he called me up and say, hey, what's going on, or you know, after my guy's got killed,

172
00:09:54.92 --> 00:09:56.92
he called me up directly.

173
00:09:56.92 --> 00:09:59.16
And that really meant a lot to me.

174
00:09:59.16 --> 00:10:03.88
And I think he meant a lot to him too, because he had a connection with the guys that were

175
00:10:03.88 --> 00:10:07.56
out there, because he knew me and knew, you know, knew me well.

176
00:10:07.56 --> 00:10:10.52
So I think that was, I think I was very important.

177
00:10:10.52 --> 00:10:12.68
And I think it's a, it's a good job.

178
00:10:12.68 --> 00:10:14.12
I'm not going to say you're going to like it.

179
00:10:14.12 --> 00:10:18.12
If there's troopers out there that are up for that job, you're not going to like it.

180
00:10:18.12 --> 00:10:23.24
If you're, if you're a hard-court, get an after kind of guy, you're not going to like the job.

181
00:10:23.24 --> 00:10:27.32
The people that actually in the scary thing is that people that volunteer and want to have

182
00:10:27.32 --> 00:10:30.68
that job are usually the guys, the animals don't want, because that's a guy that's like

183
00:10:30.68 --> 00:10:32.48
focused on advancing his career.

184
00:10:32.48 --> 00:10:35.52
And hey, if I'm coming, coming in aid, then I'll know the admiral.

185
00:10:35.52 --> 00:10:38.56
And so you're not going to, those of the guys, the admiral's actually, at least the admiral

186
00:10:38.56 --> 00:10:40.28
I work for, he didn't want any guys like that.

187
00:10:40.28 --> 00:10:44.28
He wanted guys that were going to say, oh, I, I want a guy that's going to come kicking and

188
00:10:44.28 --> 00:10:45.64
screaming to this job.

189
00:10:45.64 --> 00:10:46.64
Yeah.

190
00:10:46.64 --> 00:10:50.12
Because he doesn't want to, it's where it uniform.

191
00:10:50.12 --> 00:10:51.12
He wants to be in the field.

192
00:10:51.12 --> 00:10:52.76
I want to be in the field.

193
00:10:52.76 --> 00:10:55.16
So that's kind of the AD camp.

194
00:10:55.16 --> 00:10:59.76
So if there's a trooper out there that's going to get pushed in that position, you know,

195
00:10:59.76 --> 00:11:01.32
you might have to do it.

196
00:11:01.32 --> 00:11:05.56
And, and when you do it, you do the best that you can.

197
00:11:05.56 --> 00:11:13.56
When, when the guy that took over for me, he said, because I was, you know, I was, I've

198
00:11:13.56 --> 00:11:14.96
always been early to work.

199
00:11:14.96 --> 00:11:18.64
Well, when I was working for the boss, I was even earlier because this is, you know, I've felt

200
00:11:18.64 --> 00:11:21.76
this, this responsibility that, you know, I got to take care of this guy.

201
00:11:21.76 --> 00:11:22.76
He's taking care of all the seals.

202
00:11:22.76 --> 00:11:23.76
I got to take care of him.

203
00:11:23.76 --> 00:11:24.76
Right?

204
00:11:24.76 --> 00:11:29.12
This guy, the more the easier I make his job, the easier I make his life, the more he can

205
00:11:29.12 --> 00:11:34.28
focus on taking care of all the guys that are in the field and all the seals.

206
00:11:34.28 --> 00:11:39.04
And so when I, I was get show up even earlier than I would normally show up and I was

207
00:11:39.04 --> 00:11:43.16
double in triple in quadruple check everything that was going on.

208
00:11:43.16 --> 00:11:48.76
And when the guy came, it to relieve me and take my place.

209
00:11:48.76 --> 00:11:54.92
And he said, he said, you know, hey, how does the, how does the boss react if you drop

210
00:11:54.92 --> 00:11:57.76
the ball on something?

211
00:11:57.76 --> 00:12:00.92
And I said, I don't know.

212
00:12:00.92 --> 00:12:01.92
I don't know.

213
00:12:01.92 --> 00:12:03.24
I, I didn't drop the ball.

214
00:12:03.24 --> 00:12:06.08
I mean, that's, that was, you know, a lot of luck involved.

215
00:12:06.08 --> 00:12:11.04
And I had some, some other guys that were with me that really helped me out, you know,

216
00:12:11.04 --> 00:12:16.16
one guy in particular is a civilian guy that is, is steady, works, there has always worked

217
00:12:16.16 --> 00:12:19.28
there and worked there for a long time and he was always covered in my tracks and helped

218
00:12:19.28 --> 00:12:23.68
me not drop the ball, but he, I never dropped the ball.

219
00:12:23.68 --> 00:12:26.16
You know, it's kind of a good answer to that question.

220
00:12:26.16 --> 00:12:30.08
Like, because, you know, if you're like, oh, hey, well, he doesn't take it so hard.

221
00:12:30.08 --> 00:12:34.28
Almost like the might plant something in his mind where it may not be as important every

222
00:12:34.28 --> 00:12:35.28
single time or something.

223
00:12:35.28 --> 00:12:37.12
That's important every time you can't drop the ball.

224
00:12:37.12 --> 00:12:38.12
Yes.

225
00:12:38.12 --> 00:12:42.24
You gotta keep it going.

226
00:12:42.24 --> 00:12:44.68
Is it ever viewed by, by people, whatever that job is like, kind of emasculating or something

227
00:12:44.68 --> 00:12:49.40
because you're like, like, like an assistant more so than, you know, I don't know.

228
00:12:49.40 --> 00:12:51.44
I maybe, maybe somebody views it that way.

229
00:12:51.44 --> 00:12:52.44
Yeah.

230
00:12:52.44 --> 00:12:56.20
You know, I will, I will military guy that got tasked with a job to take care of the senior

231
00:12:56.20 --> 00:13:01.44
seal officer and keep his day moving so that he can take care of the troops.

232
00:13:01.44 --> 00:13:03.20
I don't, I think that's beneficial.

233
00:13:03.20 --> 00:13:04.20
I, right?

234
00:13:04.20 --> 00:13:05.20
I didn't, I didn't feel that way.

235
00:13:05.20 --> 00:13:09.44
The other thing is you're not, like I said, you're not allowed to do certain things.

236
00:13:09.44 --> 00:13:17.44
Well, you're not allowed to do personal things form and even, and the guy that I work for

237
00:13:17.44 --> 00:13:23.60
was very laid back and, I mean, and part of the reason he was laid back was because I never

238
00:13:23.60 --> 00:13:24.60
dropped the ball from him.

239
00:13:24.60 --> 00:13:28.16
I wouldn't want to drop the ball because I'm sure he would be angry.

240
00:13:28.16 --> 00:13:29.40
Yeah.

241
00:13:29.40 --> 00:13:32.72
But, yeah, it wasn't a bad job.

242
00:13:32.72 --> 00:13:33.72
Yeah.

243
00:13:33.72 --> 00:13:38.000
But, I would think if you understand the value of the job, really understand the value

244
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.68
of a job, you probably will never really feel emasculator or anything.

245
00:13:43.68 --> 00:13:49.48
But I think, you know, sometimes some of us can go into jobs and be like, you know,

246
00:13:49.48 --> 00:13:52.60
I'm a leader, I'm not a helper.

247
00:13:52.60 --> 00:13:54.24
You know, kind of kind of attitude.

248
00:13:54.24 --> 00:13:55.24
Yeah.

249
00:13:55.24 --> 00:14:00.28
Well, it's interesting too because when you're working for the admiral, then when you speak,

250
00:14:00.28 --> 00:14:04.36
you kind of kind of, you kind of speak for the admiral.

251
00:14:04.36 --> 00:14:09.04
So in other words, when I'd go into talk to some senior captains and I said, hey, can I get

252
00:14:09.04 --> 00:14:11.40
a copy of XYZ?

253
00:14:11.40 --> 00:14:12.84
They knew it wasn't me that wanted it.

254
00:14:12.84 --> 00:14:14.28
They knew it was the boss that wanted it.

255
00:14:14.28 --> 00:14:15.68
So people are snapping too.

256
00:14:15.68 --> 00:14:18.64
So it was pretty, it was interesting from that perspective.

257
00:14:18.64 --> 00:14:23.52
You know, all the young lieutenant at the time, I'd go in and say, hey, can we get this,

258
00:14:23.52 --> 00:14:25.08
we need this report?

259
00:14:25.08 --> 00:14:27.72
And the guy's going to be like jumping to like full captains would be jumping to because

260
00:14:27.72 --> 00:14:31.08
they knew that it wasn't for me and they respected the boss and they wanted to help

261
00:14:31.08 --> 00:14:32.08
them out.

262
00:14:32.08 --> 00:14:38.52
So it was, you do, you get a little bit of added weight because people know, especially

263
00:14:38.52 --> 00:14:41.000
because people kind of knew we had a good relationship.

264
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.68
And so they knew that if I was asking for something or I needed something or I was suggesting

265
00:14:44.68 --> 00:14:47.12
something, they knew where I was coming from.

266
00:14:47.12 --> 00:14:49.000
They knew it was coming from the big boss man.

267
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.04
So it was kind of like, like, the executive assistant to like Oprah or something.

268
00:14:55.04 --> 00:15:00.40
Well, no, there you go.

269
00:15:00.40 --> 00:15:04.20
We're not going to talk about the person that you just talked about on this podcast.

270
00:15:04.20 --> 00:15:06.20
It's not happening.

271
00:15:06.20 --> 00:15:08.88
I gotcha.

272
00:15:08.88 --> 00:15:11.24
There, there.

273
00:15:11.24 --> 00:15:17.20
I'm just saying, you know, if you go around and you're like, hey, I need.

274
00:15:17.20 --> 00:15:22.36
I would say it would be the equivalent of being the executive assistant to a very powerful

275
00:15:22.36 --> 00:15:32.44
CEO that has a lot of stress and decisions to make and has a large global corporation.

276
00:15:32.44 --> 00:15:33.44
Yeah.

277
00:15:33.44 --> 00:15:35.64
In their under their command.

278
00:15:35.64 --> 00:15:39.36
Actually, that kind of reminds me of the whole flying first class thing.

279
00:15:39.36 --> 00:15:42.80
And I thought about this where there was a big part of me that thought, oh, yeah, a lot

280
00:15:42.80 --> 00:15:46.60
of guys, they'll just fly first class just because that's like a sadist thing.

281
00:15:46.60 --> 00:15:47.96
And like, oh, yeah, I'm this high.

282
00:15:47.96 --> 00:15:50.68
So I get to, you kind of live in this luxury.

283
00:15:50.68 --> 00:15:58.04
But flying first class eliminates a lot of stress and a lot of like decision making and

284
00:15:58.04 --> 00:16:00.64
headaches, you know, we're contending with certain things.

285
00:16:00.64 --> 00:16:01.64
Yeah.

286
00:16:01.64 --> 00:16:03.80
So when you arrive, you have way less on your mind.

287
00:16:03.80 --> 00:16:06.000
So, and that's a lot.

288
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.24
You ever had to do something or convey some important message, but you have a lot on your

289
00:16:10.24 --> 00:16:11.48
mind, some other stuff.

290
00:16:11.48 --> 00:16:12.76
It makes it way harder.

291
00:16:12.76 --> 00:16:14.76
Yeah, then I just prioritize an execute.

292
00:16:14.76 --> 00:16:15.76
Yeah.

293
00:16:15.76 --> 00:16:19.48
I know, but it has its function is what I'm saying.

294
00:16:19.48 --> 00:16:20.48
It does.

295
00:16:20.48 --> 00:16:29.12
And there was the time that the literally the one time we were authorized and executed

296
00:16:29.12 --> 00:16:32.000
a first class travel was when we flew to Europe.

297
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.68
And when we arrived at six o'clock in the morning, the boss or seven o'clock in the morning,

298
00:16:36.68 --> 00:16:40.72
the boss was talking to the troops half an hour later.

299
00:16:40.72 --> 00:16:44.72
And then the whole day was scheduled about talking to the local senior leadership.

300
00:16:44.72 --> 00:16:47.52
So he needed to be arrested when he showed up there.

301
00:16:47.52 --> 00:16:52.20
Now, me on the other hand, if I remember correctly, I was in the chief seat.

302
00:16:52.20 --> 00:16:54.52
But you don't really need that much rest.

303
00:16:54.52 --> 00:16:55.68
Because you're saying that.

304
00:16:55.68 --> 00:16:57.68
Young Lieutenant can just suck it up.

305
00:16:57.68 --> 00:16:59.08
Because it is pretty pathetic.

306
00:16:59.08 --> 00:17:00.60
We're sitting here talking about first class.

307
00:17:00.60 --> 00:17:01.60
Do we, you know what?

308
00:17:01.60 --> 00:17:03.08
Let's just talk about Bob Hoffman.

309
00:17:03.08 --> 00:17:04.08
Do you know what I mean?

310
00:17:04.08 --> 00:17:04.92
Well, war won.

311
00:17:04.92 --> 00:17:05.92
Trench warfare.

312
00:17:05.92 --> 00:17:08.52
Yeah, he used to worry about flying first class.

313
00:17:08.52 --> 00:17:10.32
Yeah, and he had a lot of decisions to me.

314
00:17:10.32 --> 00:17:11.32
Yeah.

315
00:17:11.32 --> 00:17:12.96
So let's just suck it up.

316
00:17:12.96 --> 00:17:13.96
I'm stuck it up.

317
00:17:13.96 --> 00:17:14.96
All right.

318
00:17:14.96 --> 00:17:16.96
That's a question.

319
00:17:16.96 --> 00:17:20.92
Marco, do you have a suggestion for Marshall Art for a wheelchair user?

320
00:17:20.92 --> 00:17:26.64
I'm considering FMA, just Filipino martial arts or Krav Maga.

321
00:17:26.64 --> 00:17:29.84
I want exercise and self defense.

322
00:17:29.84 --> 00:17:36.08
Well, again, this is as usual.

323
00:17:36.08 --> 00:17:46.92
My first suggestion for true self defense to protect yourself from the world.

324
00:17:46.92 --> 00:17:51.16
And the evils of the world concealed caring.

325
00:17:51.16 --> 00:17:55.96
You know, get a weapon or not a shoot a weapon spend time at the range train train with

326
00:17:55.96 --> 00:17:57.04
it is a mart.

327
00:17:57.04 --> 00:17:58.76
Shooting a weapon is a martial art.

328
00:17:58.76 --> 00:18:01.48
Carrying a weapon is a martial art.

329
00:18:01.48 --> 00:18:05.44
Knowing how to use that weapon in various situations, it is a martial art.

330
00:18:05.44 --> 00:18:08.24
So shooting is a martial art.

331
00:18:08.24 --> 00:18:15.000
And so that's the most effective martial art to know and to have the possession of

332
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.20
the weapon is concealed carry weapons.

333
00:18:19.20 --> 00:18:26.12
So again, I'm not saying that just because this individual's in a wheelchair.

334
00:18:26.12 --> 00:18:34.68
Because, I mean, obviously being in a wheelchair does put you at a disadvantage.

335
00:18:34.68 --> 00:18:38.72
But it doesn't matter wheelchair or not.

336
00:18:38.72 --> 00:18:41.60
There's always going to be somebody that's bigger and better than you.

337
00:18:41.60 --> 00:18:44.80
And if there's not somebody that's bigger and better than you, then there's three or four

338
00:18:44.80 --> 00:18:47.64
people come by and together that make a person that's better than you.

339
00:18:47.64 --> 00:18:49.52
That's called a gang.

340
00:18:49.52 --> 00:18:57.68
And I will tell you right now, any three people in the world can beat anyone in the world

341
00:18:57.68 --> 00:18:58.84
of the night.

342
00:18:58.84 --> 00:19:01.64
Like three on one, you're going to lose.

343
00:19:01.64 --> 00:19:02.64
Oh, okay.

344
00:19:02.64 --> 00:19:05.04
Now, can you get a guy that knocks him or somebody out turns around?

345
00:19:05.04 --> 00:19:06.84
I mean, it does happen.

346
00:19:06.84 --> 00:19:12.60
But if people that are attacking know anything, you have a really bad chance, really

347
00:19:12.60 --> 00:19:13.60
bad chance of winning.

348
00:19:13.60 --> 00:19:16.52
It's very tough to win a fight three on one.

349
00:19:16.52 --> 00:19:20.04
So train with firearms, get a gun.

350
00:19:20.04 --> 00:19:23.96
And you know also, and you mentioned the Filipino martial arts.

351
00:19:23.96 --> 00:19:28.88
And I sometimes fail to mention this to carry a knife.

352
00:19:28.88 --> 00:19:30.92
But yeah, you should absolutely have a knife.

353
00:19:30.92 --> 00:19:32.64
You should know how to use it.

354
00:19:32.64 --> 00:19:40.40
So that is your Filipino martial arts generally, learning to use a knife and carry a knife.

355
00:19:40.40 --> 00:19:43.32
And then what am I going to do after that?

356
00:19:43.32 --> 00:19:45.60
I'm going to do the same thing I was talking about.

357
00:19:45.60 --> 00:19:47.28
Do you just do boxing wrestling and boy tie?

358
00:19:47.28 --> 00:19:49.36
Kind of in that order.

359
00:19:49.36 --> 00:19:52.32
Now, do you just do boxing wrestling and boy tie?

360
00:19:52.32 --> 00:19:53.32
We start with jujitsu.

361
00:19:53.32 --> 00:19:54.32
We move on to boxing.

362
00:19:54.32 --> 00:19:56.68
We learn wrestling and boy learn more tie.

363
00:19:56.68 --> 00:19:59.92
Sometimes, boy tie and wrestling, you can flip back and forth, which one you want to focus

364
00:19:59.92 --> 00:20:00.92
on.

365
00:20:00.92 --> 00:20:02.32
The deal is with all three of those.

366
00:20:02.32 --> 00:20:06.24
You have to adapt them to the situation that you're in.

367
00:20:06.24 --> 00:20:08.24
Whatever that situation is.

368
00:20:08.24 --> 00:20:11.24
Now, if you're in a wheelchair, I don't know what this is going to look like for you.

369
00:20:11.24 --> 00:20:13.000
I don't know what that looks like.

370
00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.20
You've got to learn it.

371
00:20:14.20 --> 00:20:15.20
You've got to understand it.

372
00:20:15.20 --> 00:20:16.88
You've got to make things work.

373
00:20:16.88 --> 00:20:17.88
You've got to figure it out.

374
00:20:17.88 --> 00:20:18.88
You've got to test it.

375
00:20:18.88 --> 00:20:19.88
You've got to see what's effective.

376
00:20:19.88 --> 00:20:23.48
And you've got to see what isn't effective.

377
00:20:23.48 --> 00:20:25.68
And you have to adapt.

378
00:20:25.68 --> 00:20:26.68
You have to adapt.

379
00:20:26.68 --> 00:20:30.80
And I've trained with all kinds of different people.

380
00:20:30.80 --> 00:20:36.92
And have their own obstacles to overcome.

381
00:20:36.92 --> 00:20:43.28
I've trained with guys that have amputees, misinone, leg, two legs, misinorms.

382
00:20:43.28 --> 00:20:45.64
I've trained with people that are blind.

383
00:20:45.64 --> 00:20:48.56
I've trained with people that are paralyzed.

384
00:20:48.56 --> 00:20:53.76
I've trained with people with traumatic brain injuries.

385
00:20:53.76 --> 00:20:57.12
And they all work and try and figure away.

386
00:20:57.12 --> 00:20:58.24
And they do figure ways.

387
00:20:58.24 --> 00:21:01.28
You've got kind of like a Kyle Manard.

388
00:21:01.28 --> 00:21:02.28
Do you know who that is?

389
00:21:02.28 --> 00:21:03.28
Yes, they do.

390
00:21:03.28 --> 00:21:06.48
He's got norms and no legs.

391
00:21:06.48 --> 00:21:09.88
And he trains due to and he wrestled in high school.

392
00:21:09.88 --> 00:21:12.56
He competed and he competed in due to.

393
00:21:12.56 --> 00:21:17.88
He's actually competed in MMA as well, which is crazy.

394
00:21:17.88 --> 00:21:19.48
But you know what?

395
00:21:19.48 --> 00:21:23.56
He adapts to the situation that he's in.

396
00:21:23.56 --> 00:21:28.36
And there's Anthony Robles.

397
00:21:28.36 --> 00:21:30.16
He's in C.D.

398
00:21:30.16 --> 00:21:31.16
NC.

399
00:21:31.16 --> 00:21:36.12
AA, 125 pound champion.

400
00:21:36.12 --> 00:21:37.12
Champion.

401
00:21:37.12 --> 00:21:39.08
And by the way, he has one leg.

402
00:21:39.08 --> 00:21:40.08
I mean one leg.

403
00:21:40.08 --> 00:21:43.08
His other leg is gone from the hip down.

404
00:21:43.08 --> 00:21:44.84
One leg.

405
00:21:44.84 --> 00:21:47.92
And he won the NC AA Championship.

406
00:21:47.92 --> 00:21:51.16
That's incredible.

407
00:21:51.16 --> 00:21:52.16
And he just did that.

408
00:21:52.16 --> 00:21:53.96
He got John Jacques Mishado.

409
00:21:53.96 --> 00:21:56.80
He's got one hand, Jeff Rial.

410
00:21:56.80 --> 00:21:57.80
Jeff Rial.

411
00:21:57.80 --> 00:21:58.96
He's trains with us.

412
00:21:58.96 --> 00:22:00.64
He's got one hand.

413
00:22:00.64 --> 00:22:01.92
His other hand's gone.

414
00:22:01.92 --> 00:22:03.96
He was born with no hand.

415
00:22:03.96 --> 00:22:04.96
Oh, guess what?

416
00:22:04.96 --> 00:22:08.44
Now all you just you players out there that you think about when you're doing you just

417
00:22:08.44 --> 00:22:09.36
with the G.

418
00:22:09.36 --> 00:22:10.68
And think of how much you grab.

419
00:22:10.68 --> 00:22:13.80
When you're trading with Jeff, you don't even know that he doesn't have a hand.

420
00:22:13.80 --> 00:22:14.96
He just don't even know.

421
00:22:14.96 --> 00:22:16.44
He just does other stuff.

422
00:22:16.44 --> 00:22:17.44
He's adapted to it.

423
00:22:17.44 --> 00:22:21.84
As a matter of fact, he uses that stomp to choke you in attack you.

424
00:22:21.84 --> 00:22:22.84
He gets in there.

425
00:22:22.84 --> 00:22:27.84
Yeah, he sneaks that thing in there.

426
00:22:27.84 --> 00:22:29.84
We have a max, max a million.

427
00:22:29.84 --> 00:22:31.84
Yeah, yeah, max right.

428
00:22:31.84 --> 00:22:33.84
Max, he's paralyzed.

429
00:22:33.84 --> 00:22:35.64
But and that's recent too.

430
00:22:35.64 --> 00:22:36.64
So yeah, yeah.

431
00:22:36.64 --> 00:22:38.04
You know, he got paralyzed.

432
00:22:38.04 --> 00:22:39.04
What?

433
00:22:39.04 --> 00:22:40.04
Three years, five or four years ago?

434
00:22:40.04 --> 00:22:41.04
Something like that.

435
00:22:41.04 --> 00:22:42.04
Yeah.

436
00:22:42.04 --> 00:22:43.44
He was like maybe a white belt.

437
00:22:43.44 --> 00:22:44.44
Maybe a bean belt.

438
00:22:44.44 --> 00:22:45.44
He's a blue belt.

439
00:22:45.44 --> 00:22:46.84
I think he's a purple now.

440
00:22:46.84 --> 00:22:47.84
Yeah, I think he's a purple now.

441
00:22:47.84 --> 00:22:51.44
But I mean, he's got basically, I think it's about sternum down.

442
00:22:51.44 --> 00:22:53.44
He's completely paralyzed sternum down.

443
00:22:53.44 --> 00:22:54.44
Yeah.

444
00:22:54.44 --> 00:22:58.000
And he's so he's figured out he actually has to move his legs.

445
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.84
You know, like he, when he's when you're rolling with him, he's got to grab his legs

446
00:23:00.84 --> 00:23:05.12
and move him into different positions, which is crazy.

447
00:23:05.12 --> 00:23:06.12
But he's still training.

448
00:23:06.12 --> 00:23:08.84
He's advancing and he's learning to adapt.

449
00:23:08.84 --> 00:23:10.56
He knows how to choke you.

450
00:23:10.56 --> 00:23:13.32
He's figured things out.

451
00:23:13.32 --> 00:23:20.000
So whether you're shorter, tall, bigger, small, old, their yugs, stronger, weak,

452
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:27.52
wheelchair, no wheelchair, leg, no leg, learn it, learn it all.

453
00:23:27.52 --> 00:23:31.72
And start with you, Jitsu, learn some boxing, some mojitai, then wrestling.

454
00:23:31.72 --> 00:23:35.76
And then once you get that base built up, start looking at crawvmogastar, looking at

455
00:23:35.76 --> 00:23:36.76
kali.

456
00:23:36.76 --> 00:23:43.60
So you can learn, you know, if you want to learn weapons, and obviously from the beginning,

457
00:23:43.60 --> 00:23:45.56
the firearm trumps everything.

458
00:23:45.56 --> 00:23:46.56
Yeah.

459
00:23:46.56 --> 00:23:49.96
Yeah, especially when you're training with, like any kind of distance,

460
00:23:49.96 --> 00:23:55.56
advantage or whatever, I think it's important to understand what your potential goal will

461
00:23:55.56 --> 00:23:57.80
be in a self-defense situation.

462
00:23:57.80 --> 00:24:02.48
So if you're, you know, like if you don't have legs like Max, for example, like you

463
00:24:02.48 --> 00:24:07.60
can learn a lot of stuff that is just defensive.

464
00:24:07.60 --> 00:24:13.64
And if you know Jitsu, and I'm a son like a Jitsu advocate, which I am.

465
00:24:13.64 --> 00:24:19.20
But if you learn Jitsu, you'll learn how to be defensive, how you can shut down another

466
00:24:19.20 --> 00:24:20.72
guy's attacks.

467
00:24:20.72 --> 00:24:25.84
And he's so like I said, like if you're, like your disadvantage is pretty big, just understand

468
00:24:25.84 --> 00:24:30.64
what your goals will be in a potential self-defense situation.

469
00:24:30.64 --> 00:24:34.24
You know, so you're not going to be like, okay, I'm going to learn these martial arts.

470
00:24:34.24 --> 00:24:37.88
So I can kick as much ass as I possibly can.

471
00:24:37.88 --> 00:24:38.88
Yeah, that's the point.

472
00:24:38.88 --> 00:24:43.44
The point of this is that you have to adapt.

473
00:24:43.44 --> 00:24:44.44
You have to adapt.

474
00:24:44.44 --> 00:24:46.12
You have to say, okay, this is what I'm going to do.

475
00:24:46.12 --> 00:24:48.44
And this is, I can't do that move, but I can do this move.

476
00:24:48.44 --> 00:24:50.68
And by the way, you can't do this, but I can do that.

477
00:24:50.68 --> 00:24:51.68
Yes.

478
00:24:51.68 --> 00:24:54.52
And you know, like we were just talking about Jeffrey, all the Jeffrey Alzagai trained with

479
00:24:54.52 --> 00:24:56.76
the most regularly out of these folks.

480
00:24:56.76 --> 00:25:03.32
And he has adapted and does things that you, that is totally unique to him.

481
00:25:03.32 --> 00:25:04.72
And he makes an event.

482
00:25:04.72 --> 00:25:06.76
He takes a disadvantage, turns it into an advantage.

483
00:25:06.76 --> 00:25:11.88
You know, yeah, there's an MMA guy who was the champ and one of these shows, I forget.

484
00:25:11.88 --> 00:25:13.12
I might have been bellotaur, maybe.

485
00:25:13.12 --> 00:25:14.72
I don't know, I forget.

486
00:25:14.72 --> 00:25:19.36
But he used, he had one hand too, he used the champ though.

487
00:25:19.36 --> 00:25:21.64
I think one, how do I know who that is?

488
00:25:21.64 --> 00:25:23.76
I forget his name too, but it was wild.

489
00:25:23.76 --> 00:25:25.52
It's like maybe a year ago or something or more.

490
00:25:25.52 --> 00:25:26.76
A while ago a year.

491
00:25:26.76 --> 00:25:28.80
And it's been around for 20 plus years.

492
00:25:28.80 --> 00:25:29.80
Right.

493
00:25:29.80 --> 00:25:30.80
But in America.

494
00:25:30.80 --> 00:25:34.08
The current champ is always seem so new.

495
00:25:34.08 --> 00:25:36.32
Yeah, that's awesome.

496
00:25:36.32 --> 00:25:41.16
That is definitely outstanding to see people overcome that.

497
00:25:41.16 --> 00:25:44.48
And in what you can do.

498
00:25:44.48 --> 00:25:53.64
You just gotta have that, that, that, the creative mind to get in there and adapt to the situation.

499
00:25:53.64 --> 00:25:54.64
Yeah.

500
00:25:54.64 --> 00:25:59.76
And it goes along with kind of what I think it was, I forget to.

501
00:25:59.76 --> 00:26:04.32
But how they say, you know, a little exercise is better than no exercise, you know?

502
00:26:04.32 --> 00:26:08.56
So sometimes like if you find yourself in a wheelchair or something like this, where it'll

503
00:26:08.56 --> 00:26:10.64
be like, oh yeah, that's not for me.

504
00:26:10.64 --> 00:26:12.64
But this obviously is for him.

505
00:26:12.64 --> 00:26:13.64
You know?

506
00:26:13.64 --> 00:26:17.44
And like how you say, like, learn something or learn it all, whatever.

507
00:26:17.44 --> 00:26:18.72
That's better than not knowing nothing.

508
00:26:18.72 --> 00:26:20.12
No way better too.

509
00:26:20.12 --> 00:26:21.12
Yeah, this.

510
00:26:21.12 --> 00:26:22.12
Especially that.

511
00:26:22.12 --> 00:26:23.12
Especially that.

512
00:26:23.12 --> 00:26:24.12
Yeah.

513
00:26:24.12 --> 00:26:25.12
Good.

514
00:26:25.12 --> 00:26:26.12
Good after it.

515
00:26:26.12 --> 00:26:27.12
That's it.

516
00:26:27.12 --> 00:26:28.12
Next question.

517
00:26:28.12 --> 00:26:29.12
Jockel.

518
00:26:29.12 --> 00:26:31.12
Mr. Jockel.

519
00:26:31.12 --> 00:26:35.64
Whenever I get mentally overwhelmed, I shut down completely.

520
00:26:35.64 --> 00:26:37.96
How do I counter that?

521
00:26:37.96 --> 00:26:43.24
Well, the first thing and the first good step that you've already made is you've identified

522
00:26:43.24 --> 00:26:44.40
this is an issue.

523
00:26:44.40 --> 00:26:46.36
You recognize the fact that you shut down.

524
00:26:46.36 --> 00:26:49.32
That's step number one in solving your problems identifying your problem.

525
00:26:49.32 --> 00:26:51.08
So excellent work there.

526
00:26:51.08 --> 00:26:53.000
The next step is actually pretty easy as well.

527
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.36
You've identified the fact that you shut down.

528
00:26:55.36 --> 00:26:59.28
The next step that you're going to do is not shut down.

529
00:26:59.28 --> 00:27:00.28
Not mentally shut down.

530
00:27:00.28 --> 00:27:01.60
That's what you want to do.

531
00:27:01.60 --> 00:27:06.04
If you start to shut down and you feel yourself freezing up, say, I'm not going to shut

532
00:27:06.04 --> 00:27:07.04
down right now.

533
00:27:07.04 --> 00:27:08.44
I'm going to attack this issue.

534
00:27:08.44 --> 00:27:14.36
Now, the reason that you're getting overwhelmed most likely is because there's a lot

535
00:27:14.36 --> 00:27:18.80
of different things flying at you at the same time and they're all happening at once.

536
00:27:18.80 --> 00:27:20.36
And it's problematic for you.

537
00:27:20.36 --> 00:27:21.84
We have a very simple solution for that.

538
00:27:21.84 --> 00:27:23.36
It's prioritizing execute.

539
00:27:23.36 --> 00:27:25.96
So what is the biggest problem that you've got going on?

540
00:27:25.96 --> 00:27:27.96
Let's identify what that biggest problem is.

541
00:27:27.96 --> 00:27:29.76
Then let's attack that problem and get it solved.

542
00:27:29.76 --> 00:27:31.92
Once we got that one solved, we can move on to the next one.

543
00:27:31.92 --> 00:27:34.04
Once we get to take care of that one, we can move on to the next one.

544
00:27:34.04 --> 00:27:36.000
We go right on down the line.

545
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.12
That's what we do.

546
00:27:39.12 --> 00:27:40.84
That's very simple.

547
00:27:40.84 --> 00:27:43.72
You know that you're going to get overwhelmed.

548
00:27:43.72 --> 00:27:46.16
First of all, tell yourself you're not going to go overwhelmed.

549
00:27:46.16 --> 00:27:48.16
Then you actually don't get overwhelmed.

550
00:27:48.16 --> 00:27:49.28
And how do you not get overwhelmed?

551
00:27:49.28 --> 00:27:53.12
You prioritize an execute.

552
00:27:53.12 --> 00:27:59.12
If you start feeling yourself getting overwhelmed, do what I did to the platoon commander

553
00:27:59.12 --> 00:28:08.08
that I had that was getting all freaked out during a humv, I had just immediate action drills

554
00:28:08.08 --> 00:28:10.72
where you're patrolling through the desert.

555
00:28:10.72 --> 00:28:15.24
And we have electrical targets that pop up and then you, everyone starts shooting at the

556
00:28:15.24 --> 00:28:16.24
targets.

557
00:28:16.24 --> 00:28:22.16
And this guy was locking up and not making any decisions even though he's the leader.

558
00:28:22.16 --> 00:28:25.76
And this is the one where I took a magic marker and I wrote on this Sharpie right in front

559
00:28:25.76 --> 00:28:27.88
of his face on the humv window.

560
00:28:27.88 --> 00:28:31.32
I said, next time the shooting starts, here's what I want you to do.

561
00:28:31.32 --> 00:28:34.12
Number one, relax.

562
00:28:34.12 --> 00:28:35.60
Number two, look around.

563
00:28:35.60 --> 00:28:37.36
Number three, make a call.

564
00:28:37.36 --> 00:28:38.36
It's really easy.

565
00:28:38.36 --> 00:28:42.80
So step number one when you're getting overwhelmed, relax.

566
00:28:42.80 --> 00:28:43.80
Relax.

567
00:28:43.80 --> 00:28:45.56
Breathe, take a step back.

568
00:28:45.56 --> 00:28:47.48
Just take a step back.

569
00:28:47.48 --> 00:28:52.60
The red flags start going off in your head and you're realizing that you're getting overwhelmed

570
00:28:52.60 --> 00:28:54.12
and you're going to get shut down.

571
00:28:54.12 --> 00:28:55.12
No.

572
00:28:55.12 --> 00:29:00.60
Take a step back, relax.

573
00:29:00.60 --> 00:29:04.08
And then prioritize next Q pretty simple.

574
00:29:04.08 --> 00:29:05.08
Make a call.

575
00:29:05.08 --> 00:29:06.08
Yeah.

576
00:29:06.08 --> 00:29:07.88
Yeah, it's good.

577
00:29:07.88 --> 00:29:08.24
Simple.

578
00:29:08.24 --> 00:29:09.24
Next question.

579
00:29:09.24 --> 00:29:13.80
Let's do it.

580
00:29:13.80 --> 00:29:18.08
What technique do you use to not lose your temper with your life?

581
00:29:18.08 --> 00:29:24.40
Oh, when you know she's wrong and refuses to budge, well this is kind of a, this question

582
00:29:24.40 --> 00:29:30.32
is actually moved because my life is never wrong.

583
00:29:30.32 --> 00:29:32.88
So number one, losing your temper.

584
00:29:32.88 --> 00:29:37.32
Losing your temper is weak.

585
00:29:37.32 --> 00:29:38.32
It's actually weak.

586
00:29:38.32 --> 00:29:40.12
It's actually weak to lose your temper.

587
00:29:40.12 --> 00:29:47.64
It actually is a loss of control when you lose your temper and losing control was also

588
00:29:47.64 --> 00:29:49.20
weak.

589
00:29:49.20 --> 00:29:51.40
So we don't want to lose our temper.

590
00:29:51.40 --> 00:29:53.92
That's one of our goals.

591
00:29:53.92 --> 00:29:56.64
So again, just like prioritize next Q, what do you do?

592
00:29:56.64 --> 00:29:58.72
You start feeling yourself losing your temper.

593
00:29:58.72 --> 00:29:59.72
Stop.

594
00:29:59.72 --> 00:30:03.28
Take a step back to attach from it, breathe.

595
00:30:03.28 --> 00:30:07.28
And then you've got to think about the long term victory.

596
00:30:07.28 --> 00:30:09.80
And we've talked about this before.

597
00:30:09.80 --> 00:30:11.40
We've talked about this before.

598
00:30:11.40 --> 00:30:20.36
Proving that you're right to your wife is not necessarily the best goal to have.

599
00:30:20.36 --> 00:30:22.72
What you want to do is you want to.

600
00:30:22.72 --> 00:30:25.76
You want to win the war.

601
00:30:25.76 --> 00:30:29.20
Not that one battle, but one battle doesn't even matter.

602
00:30:29.20 --> 00:30:33.32
I mean, what is this stupid argument about anyways?

603
00:30:33.32 --> 00:30:35.20
It's not about something that matters.

604
00:30:35.20 --> 00:30:36.20
It isn't.

605
00:30:36.20 --> 00:30:38.84
I can almost guarantee it's not about something that matters.

606
00:30:38.84 --> 00:30:44.32
It's about some random thing that doesn't matter in the big picture at all.

607
00:30:44.32 --> 00:30:48.20
So why are you getting upset about it?

608
00:30:48.20 --> 00:30:49.20
Why are you losing control?

609
00:30:49.20 --> 00:30:50.20
Why are you losing your temper?

610
00:30:50.20 --> 00:30:52.40
You can't do that.

611
00:30:52.40 --> 00:30:54.40
You can't do that.

612
00:30:54.40 --> 00:30:59.08
So when you feel like you're coming up against the, this is Sun Siu.

613
00:30:59.08 --> 00:31:01.48
You're going against a heavily defended position.

614
00:31:01.48 --> 00:31:04.40
Don't attack the heavily defended position.

615
00:31:04.40 --> 00:31:07.76
If your wife is not admitting that she's wrong, she's refusing to budge.

616
00:31:07.76 --> 00:31:08.76
What are you doing?

617
00:31:08.76 --> 00:31:10.40
What are you attacking?

618
00:31:10.40 --> 00:31:13.12
You're actually attacking a heavily defended position.

619
00:31:13.12 --> 00:31:14.80
Sun Siu told you not to do that.

620
00:31:14.80 --> 00:31:18.64
2,500 years ago and it holds two to this day.

621
00:31:18.64 --> 00:31:20.88
So what are you going to do when they're not budging?

622
00:31:20.88 --> 00:31:23.16
You're going to flank them.

623
00:31:23.16 --> 00:31:25.000
You're going to flank them.

624
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.64
You're going to move around to the outside and come in from another angle that they weren't

625
00:31:29.64 --> 00:31:32.40
expecting.

626
00:31:32.40 --> 00:31:36.64
You know, maybe that other angle looks like flowers.

627
00:31:36.64 --> 00:31:38.28
Maybe the other angle looks like dinner.

628
00:31:38.28 --> 00:31:41.28
Maybe it looks like maybe it just looks like change in the subject to something that they

629
00:31:41.28 --> 00:31:48.24
can be more flexible mentally on.

630
00:31:48.24 --> 00:31:55.76
Because if you go against that hardened position, I can almost guarantee you it's not

631
00:31:55.76 --> 00:31:57.84
going to, they're not going to budge on it.

632
00:31:57.84 --> 00:32:02.56
And all you, what you're going to do to try and get them to budges, you're going to escalate

633
00:32:02.56 --> 00:32:03.56
yourself.

634
00:32:03.56 --> 00:32:04.56
Oh, you're not budging.

635
00:32:04.56 --> 00:32:05.56
They hit it harder.

636
00:32:05.56 --> 00:32:07.20
Oh, you're still not budging them, but they go even harder.

637
00:32:07.20 --> 00:32:09.12
You're still not budging them, you're going to go even harder.

638
00:32:09.12 --> 00:32:11.64
There are that whole time every time you're going harder, they're digging into defenses

639
00:32:11.64 --> 00:32:14.44
in deeper deeper deeper.

640
00:32:14.44 --> 00:32:19.80
And they're remembering how, how mean you are or whatever, especially if you're in a

641
00:32:19.80 --> 00:32:21.16
last-temperature situation.

642
00:32:21.16 --> 00:32:22.16
Oh, yeah.

643
00:32:22.16 --> 00:32:25.72
Now you're now you're taking serious detriment to your long-term war.

644
00:32:25.72 --> 00:32:26.72
Yeah.

645
00:32:26.72 --> 00:32:29.56
Because now you've given them ammunition.

646
00:32:29.56 --> 00:32:31.72
You've given them ammunition for future use.

647
00:32:31.72 --> 00:32:32.72
Bad move.

648
00:32:32.72 --> 00:32:34.16
It's a bad move.

649
00:32:34.16 --> 00:32:43.36
So again, what isn't, what, who's right and who's wrong is just not important.

650
00:32:43.36 --> 00:32:45.16
It's a lot to get through people's head.

651
00:32:45.16 --> 00:32:50.12
Who's right and who's wrong on some little tactical battle of today that really has no

652
00:32:50.12 --> 00:32:51.92
bearing on anything in the world.

653
00:32:51.92 --> 00:32:55.60
This is not something to be concerned about.

654
00:32:55.60 --> 00:32:59.68
So it might be your own ego that wants to be right.

655
00:32:59.68 --> 00:33:01.36
Have we thought about that factor?

656
00:33:01.36 --> 00:33:02.96
Have we thought about that?

657
00:33:02.96 --> 00:33:08.08
You as a man, as a husband, you want to be right to.

658
00:33:08.08 --> 00:33:10.28
So guess who the person that isn't budged?

659
00:33:10.28 --> 00:33:12.28
Guess who the person that does is and budging is.

660
00:33:12.28 --> 00:33:14.16
It's you.

661
00:33:14.16 --> 00:33:15.16
It's you.

662
00:33:15.16 --> 00:33:20.68
Now you might be quote unquote right, but it doesn't matter you're the person that won't

663
00:33:20.68 --> 00:33:21.68
budge.

664
00:33:21.68 --> 00:33:22.96
Now neither one of you will budge.

665
00:33:22.96 --> 00:33:24.52
Neither one of you will budge.

666
00:33:24.52 --> 00:33:26.000
We're not in a good situation.

667
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.12
We're just in an escalating war of destruction.

668
00:33:31.12 --> 00:33:32.12
And we don't want that.

669
00:33:32.12 --> 00:33:35.32
Because we want to win the long-term strategic war.

670
00:33:35.32 --> 00:33:37.08
That's what we're looking at.

671
00:33:37.08 --> 00:33:39.04
Just the long-term strategic war.

672
00:33:39.04 --> 00:33:42.24
The little stuff in between, we did not concern about.

673
00:33:42.24 --> 00:33:43.24
Yeah.

674
00:33:43.24 --> 00:33:44.24
Yeah, fully.

675
00:33:44.24 --> 00:33:47.96
And the whole not budging thing too.

676
00:33:47.96 --> 00:33:48.96
Like that hurts.

677
00:33:48.96 --> 00:33:53.72
And I used to think about this early on in my relationship where I would get, we'd get in

678
00:33:53.72 --> 00:33:58.000
a little arguments or whatever, varying levels.

679
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.64
And sometimes she would like, what, can you even come up with an example of something

680
00:34:04.64 --> 00:34:05.64
you'd argue about?

681
00:34:05.64 --> 00:34:08.28
Because as I was trying to think as I was sitting here as I was answering this question,

682
00:34:08.28 --> 00:34:09.56
I was trying to think of a good example.

683
00:34:09.56 --> 00:34:11.92
I can't even think of a good example.

684
00:34:11.92 --> 00:34:12.92
Yeah.

685
00:34:12.92 --> 00:34:13.92
Because they're all so stupid.

686
00:34:13.92 --> 00:34:14.92
Yeah.

687
00:34:14.92 --> 00:34:15.92
So yeah, a good example.

688
00:34:15.92 --> 00:34:16.92
No.

689
00:34:16.92 --> 00:34:17.92
Yeah.

690
00:34:17.92 --> 00:34:18.92
That's hard.

691
00:34:18.92 --> 00:34:21.92
Not really.

692
00:34:21.92 --> 00:34:26.48
But so she would be like, oh, I just don't want to talk about it anymore.

693
00:34:26.48 --> 00:34:28.92
But meanwhile, I'm still salty.

694
00:34:28.92 --> 00:34:31.76
Like, hey, we didn't resolve this.

695
00:34:31.76 --> 00:34:33.76
You know, there's certain code words.

696
00:34:33.76 --> 00:34:36.000
Like I thought, like a safe word.

697
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.92
That girls that women, that guys have a two, but in particular, I've noticed it with

698
00:34:39.92 --> 00:34:42.20
some of my friends' wives.

699
00:34:42.20 --> 00:34:46.76
And one of my wives, she'll say, doesn't, it doesn't matter.

700
00:34:46.76 --> 00:34:47.76
What do you mean, buzzword?

701
00:34:47.76 --> 00:34:48.76
Like a code word.

702
00:34:48.76 --> 00:34:49.76
No, it's a safe word.

703
00:34:49.76 --> 00:34:50.76
It's a red flag.

704
00:34:50.76 --> 00:34:57.32
So it'll just be a, it'll be a giant red flag that she's, that she's angry.

705
00:34:57.32 --> 00:35:00.12
She doesn't, nothing I say is going to matter anymore.

706
00:35:00.12 --> 00:35:01.92
She's not going to change your mind.

707
00:35:01.92 --> 00:35:02.92
And she's just going to go forward.

708
00:35:02.92 --> 00:35:04.92
And she'll be like, oh, it doesn't matter.

709
00:35:04.92 --> 00:35:05.92
I'm like, oh, okay.

710
00:35:05.92 --> 00:35:07.48
We're, morning.

711
00:35:07.48 --> 00:35:08.48
Yeah.

712
00:35:08.48 --> 00:35:10.48
They gage his angry.

713
00:35:10.48 --> 00:35:11.48
That's what it means.

714
00:35:11.48 --> 00:35:15.12
So when I hear her say, doesn't matter, I just realize, okay, I'm, now I just

715
00:35:15.12 --> 00:35:18.12
hit a, a heavily defended position.

716
00:35:18.12 --> 00:35:20.12
And I'm going to stop attacking it.

717
00:35:20.12 --> 00:35:21.12
I'm going to flank.

718
00:35:21.12 --> 00:35:23.32
I'm going to talk about something else.

719
00:35:23.32 --> 00:35:25.52
I'm coming in from the side hatch.

720
00:35:25.52 --> 00:35:26.80
That's what I'm going to do.

721
00:35:26.80 --> 00:35:27.80
Yeah.

722
00:35:27.80 --> 00:35:31.36
Yeah, man, I wish I would have known that long time ago.

723
00:35:31.36 --> 00:35:35.24
I think that when, wait, what did you just say that your wife said to you, because you

724
00:35:35.24 --> 00:35:36.40
just said a code word?

725
00:35:36.40 --> 00:35:38.24
I mean, uh, up.

726
00:35:38.24 --> 00:35:39.24
I don't want to talk about it.

727
00:35:39.24 --> 00:35:40.24
I don't want to go.

728
00:35:40.24 --> 00:35:41.24
There's another one.

729
00:35:41.24 --> 00:35:42.24
Yeah.

730
00:35:42.24 --> 00:35:43.24
I want to talk about the sets that's a red flag.

731
00:35:43.24 --> 00:35:45.88
Well, in my mind, it was like, yeah, let's talk about it.

732
00:35:45.88 --> 00:35:50.000
I, I try it would try to do it in a conducive way, like, you know, like, a problem solving

733
00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000
kind of way.

734
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.40
But she just didn't feel the same way about the whole situation.

735
00:35:54.40 --> 00:35:56.12
You know, she handles it different.

736
00:35:56.12 --> 00:36:00.52
And, you know, ultimately, I still feel like if two people are willing to talk it out

737
00:36:00.52 --> 00:36:04.72
kind of without too much emotion, I think that's an effective way to do it.

738
00:36:04.72 --> 00:36:08.12
But nonetheless, what this would cause is, and this is going back to people not

739
00:36:08.12 --> 00:36:09.12
a budget.

740
00:36:09.12 --> 00:36:14.88
So what that would cause is all this time that would go on that we're not on good terms,

741
00:36:14.88 --> 00:36:17.36
you know, because I want to talk about, she doesn't want to talk about it.

742
00:36:17.36 --> 00:36:20.88
She just wants to, I don't know, go to bed, you know, meanwhile, I am with the philosophy

743
00:36:20.88 --> 00:36:23.36
of don't go to bed in an argument or whatever, you know.

744
00:36:23.36 --> 00:36:27.000
But meanwhile, we're at odds, even just a little bit.

745
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.72
Even if we don't talk about it, she forgets about it.

746
00:36:28.72 --> 00:36:29.72
I'm still at odds.

747
00:36:29.72 --> 00:36:32.40
I'm not budging with my philosophy, you know.

748
00:36:32.40 --> 00:36:37.40
So at the end of the day, when you look back at all the minutes, all the hours, all

749
00:36:37.40 --> 00:36:46.96
the days that you've spent with each other, and now you have that, that, that some of

750
00:36:46.96 --> 00:36:50.96
of moments that you're at odds, you look at your relationship, you're like, man, this

751
00:36:50.96 --> 00:36:55.000
relationship isn't that good, because you spent that much time at odds with each other.

752
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.64
Yeah, just because you didn't want to get in touch.

753
00:36:57.64 --> 00:36:58.64
Yes.

754
00:36:58.64 --> 00:37:00.16
So you got a bunch.

755
00:37:00.16 --> 00:37:01.68
You got a bunch.

756
00:37:01.68 --> 00:37:06.80
One of my buddies, I was hanging around having this wife and her little buzzword, where

757
00:37:06.80 --> 00:37:09.88
I was like, oh, I picked up on it pretty quickly.

758
00:37:09.88 --> 00:37:10.88
She would say, that's fine.

759
00:37:10.88 --> 00:37:12.88
It's a con.

760
00:37:12.88 --> 00:37:16.48
And I was like, hey, first, you know, first couple of times, I was like, oh, it's fine

761
00:37:16.48 --> 00:37:17.48
with her.

762
00:37:17.48 --> 00:37:19.48
And then I realized that there's nothing that's fine.

763
00:37:19.48 --> 00:37:23.80
I think that's kind of a common knowledge, what, what?

764
00:37:23.80 --> 00:37:24.80
What girls?

765
00:37:24.80 --> 00:37:25.80
You could just let that up.

766
00:37:25.80 --> 00:37:28.08
Like, no matter, that's fine.

767
00:37:28.08 --> 00:37:29.08
Whatever.

768
00:37:29.08 --> 00:37:30.40
Well, whatever is offensive, though.

769
00:37:30.40 --> 00:37:31.40
Oh, yeah.

770
00:37:31.40 --> 00:37:34.84
And they know if they say whatever, then that means that's fighting words.

771
00:37:34.84 --> 00:37:37.56
Because if you'll notice, that's fine.

772
00:37:37.56 --> 00:37:39.28
And it doesn't matter.

773
00:37:39.28 --> 00:37:45.20
They are all, they are all, like, sort of passive.

774
00:37:45.20 --> 00:37:46.20
Yeah.

775
00:37:46.20 --> 00:37:48.76
The way of saying, like, oh, let's just move on.

776
00:37:48.76 --> 00:37:49.76
Yeah.

777
00:37:49.76 --> 00:37:50.76
I don't want to talk about it.

778
00:37:50.76 --> 00:37:51.76
That one's a borderline.

779
00:37:51.76 --> 00:37:52.76
Yeah.

780
00:37:52.76 --> 00:37:54.76
Or it's like, or it's like one of the, I don't know.

781
00:37:54.76 --> 00:37:59.08
So what's good is when you detach from these situations, you start to pick up on

782
00:37:59.08 --> 00:38:02.04
these things that you're significant other.

783
00:38:02.04 --> 00:38:05.52
And also, there's, when you're in a relationship, you're in a team building, in

784
00:38:05.52 --> 00:38:09.48
a team environment, or you're in a business, you start to realize that guys or people

785
00:38:09.48 --> 00:38:11.60
you work with will have the same thing.

786
00:38:11.60 --> 00:38:12.60
Yeah.

787
00:38:12.60 --> 00:38:14.60
Well, let's say, you know what it's your call.

788
00:38:14.60 --> 00:38:15.60
Okay.

789
00:38:15.60 --> 00:38:20.96
I know it's my call, but I'm not trying to impose this plan on you.

790
00:38:20.96 --> 00:38:21.96
Let's figure it out.

791
00:38:21.96 --> 00:38:22.96
No, it's your call.

792
00:38:22.96 --> 00:38:23.96
We'll go ahead.

793
00:38:23.96 --> 00:38:24.96
Yeah.

794
00:38:24.96 --> 00:38:25.96
So that means you clearly don't agree with it.

795
00:38:25.96 --> 00:38:27.24
And of course, you can't say this to him, because they're already dug in on the fact

796
00:38:27.24 --> 00:38:29.24
that you're, you know, that you're wrong.

797
00:38:29.24 --> 00:38:30.24
Yeah.

798
00:38:30.24 --> 00:38:31.92
So those are little red flags.

799
00:38:31.92 --> 00:38:33.60
You got to look out for it in the world.

800
00:38:33.60 --> 00:38:34.60
Yeah.

801
00:38:34.60 --> 00:38:35.60
And that's back.

802
00:38:35.60 --> 00:38:37.48
And that's fun.

803
00:38:37.48 --> 00:38:43.28
And even that's a complex thing, because you know when someone says, fine, you know,

804
00:38:43.28 --> 00:38:45.64
what's wrong, what's wrong, nothing, right?

805
00:38:45.64 --> 00:38:50.68
Oh, you know, or you have reason to believe that it's not fine, especially the

806
00:38:50.68 --> 00:38:53.20
find or that's fine.

807
00:38:53.20 --> 00:38:55.32
You have good reason to believe that it's not fine.

808
00:38:55.32 --> 00:38:56.32
Right.

809
00:38:56.32 --> 00:39:00.76
So you're not fine.

810
00:39:00.76 --> 00:39:02.56
It's logical to think, hey, you shouldn't say you're fine when you're not fine.

811
00:39:02.56 --> 00:39:07.20
You actively chose to say you're fine when you're not fine, factually.

812
00:39:07.20 --> 00:39:09.76
So it's easy to come to that logical conclusion.

813
00:39:09.76 --> 00:39:10.76
Yeah.

814
00:39:10.76 --> 00:39:11.76
But there's your problem.

815
00:39:11.76 --> 00:39:12.76
Right.

816
00:39:12.76 --> 00:39:13.76
Logical.

817
00:39:13.76 --> 00:39:15.36
I'm just, you know, it's just, it's not that simple.

818
00:39:15.36 --> 00:39:16.48
It's not that black and white.

819
00:39:16.48 --> 00:39:22.96
So I'm saying this because I kind of, up until really recently, I thought that, hey,

820
00:39:22.96 --> 00:39:24.92
look, I'm not really wrong with this thing.

821
00:39:24.92 --> 00:39:27.08
I ask you a very specific question.

822
00:39:27.08 --> 00:39:32.08
If you're saying you're fine, it's like, it doesn't even matter what you say.

823
00:39:32.08 --> 00:39:37.40
I have to read like your mind or your body language and like everything, you know?

824
00:39:37.40 --> 00:39:39.80
And disregard your words.

825
00:39:39.80 --> 00:39:45.76
And only under these circumstances, not when you, when I say, hey, do you need, I don't

826
00:39:45.76 --> 00:39:49.64
know milk from the store, you say no, I know you mean, yeah, you know, it doesn't work

827
00:39:49.64 --> 00:39:50.64
like that.

828
00:39:50.64 --> 00:39:52.08
It's only under the circumstance.

829
00:39:52.08 --> 00:39:55.76
So it's like, and thinking, hey, man, that's kind of, that's not very good.

830
00:39:55.76 --> 00:39:58.08
That's a bad thing and habit to get in.

831
00:39:58.08 --> 00:40:00.000
So if you're not fine, you should say, you're not fine.

832
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.32
That's my logic is what I'm saying.

833
00:40:01.32 --> 00:40:02.52
But here's the thing.

834
00:40:02.52 --> 00:40:05.88
When you're in a relationship with someone and it starts, I understand it starts at the

835
00:40:05.88 --> 00:40:07.92
beginning where you're trying to figure all this stuff out.

836
00:40:07.92 --> 00:40:09.96
That's what the beginning of the relationship for.

837
00:40:09.96 --> 00:40:12.96
But after a while, you start to know, okay, I know that tone.

838
00:40:12.96 --> 00:40:14.56
I know when you say fine, it's not fine.

839
00:40:14.56 --> 00:40:18.84
What the thing that's jacked up is when people don't realize that.

840
00:40:18.84 --> 00:40:22.08
That's a code word that means something else.

841
00:40:22.08 --> 00:40:23.08
Right.

842
00:40:23.08 --> 00:40:27.48
What you're signifying is you are coming up against a heavily defended area.

843
00:40:27.48 --> 00:40:31.68
I'm not changing my mind, but I'm not going to sit here and argue about it.

844
00:40:31.68 --> 00:40:34.76
So you know what, doesn't matter is what my wife would say.

845
00:40:34.76 --> 00:40:35.76
Yeah.

846
00:40:35.76 --> 00:40:36.76
Oh, it doesn't matter.

847
00:40:36.76 --> 00:40:38.36
Pro men, win matters.

848
00:40:38.36 --> 00:40:43.76
When, when Sarah would say, I don't want to argue, I don't want to argue about this.

849
00:40:43.76 --> 00:40:44.76
It's, it's fine.

850
00:40:44.76 --> 00:40:45.76
Let's not talk about it.

851
00:40:45.76 --> 00:40:47.04
That would encourage me for further.

852
00:40:47.04 --> 00:40:51.48
But not like, I'm not a loose temper, kind of whatever, but it would frustrate you.

853
00:40:51.48 --> 00:40:54.68
It would make me, well, I'd be like, no, we have to go to, it's like, you know, if you

854
00:40:54.68 --> 00:41:02.16
have like, fucking, like a splinter, like you have a splinter in your hand or something,

855
00:41:02.16 --> 00:41:04.72
not talking about it is like, I just leave it.

856
00:41:04.72 --> 00:41:07.36
Let the skin grow over it and you'll be fine.

857
00:41:07.36 --> 00:41:08.60
And the thing is, you probably will be fine.

858
00:41:08.60 --> 00:41:10.56
But he's still got that splinter in there.

859
00:41:10.56 --> 00:41:12.04
Me, I'm like, okay, let's talk about this.

860
00:41:12.04 --> 00:41:16.16
Open it up and get the splinter out.

861
00:41:16.16 --> 00:41:21.16
But she's like, no, you know, I can't always recommend ripping that splinter out.

862
00:41:21.16 --> 00:41:28.08
Yeah, and sometimes the, again, you're going up against a hard defensive area.

863
00:41:28.08 --> 00:41:29.32
That's what we're talking about here.

864
00:41:29.32 --> 00:41:33.08
That's the question is, the question is, how do you, not lose your temper with your wife

865
00:41:33.08 --> 00:41:35.72
when you know she's wrong and she refused to punch you.

866
00:41:35.72 --> 00:41:37.44
No, you don't do it.

867
00:41:37.44 --> 00:41:39.04
You know how you maintain your temper.

868
00:41:39.04 --> 00:41:45.84
You realize that you're in a strategic situation where you're just going to win strategically.

869
00:41:45.84 --> 00:41:47.40
You're going to outsmart.

870
00:41:47.40 --> 00:41:48.76
You're going to outmaneuver.

871
00:41:48.76 --> 00:41:50.48
You're going to outmanipulate.

872
00:41:50.48 --> 00:41:51.48
I'm sorry.

873
00:41:51.48 --> 00:41:53.08
You're going to manipulate this situation.

874
00:41:53.08 --> 00:41:55.44
That's what you're going to do.

875
00:41:55.44 --> 00:42:00.44
And you're going to make her think, you know what, man, I was kind of a chair class night

876
00:42:00.44 --> 00:42:02.40
to my wonderful husband.

877
00:42:02.40 --> 00:42:03.40
Yeah.

878
00:42:03.40 --> 00:42:05.40
That's what we're going to have.

879
00:42:05.40 --> 00:42:07.60
Yeah, you got to do it in this genuine way.

880
00:42:07.60 --> 00:42:12.60
You know, of course you got to do it in real genuine and open and warm.

881
00:42:12.60 --> 00:42:17.56
And once I attack you when you're in that state, you know, so that's what you do to me my

882
00:42:17.56 --> 00:42:18.56
wife.

883
00:42:18.56 --> 00:42:24.72
No, I'm telling you, maybe if you switch all of a sudden and she's like, hey, this is

884
00:42:24.72 --> 00:42:25.72
the trick.

885
00:42:25.72 --> 00:42:29.36
But if you're like, if you put it on, you're just disarming them.

886
00:42:29.36 --> 00:42:30.36
Right.

887
00:42:30.36 --> 00:42:31.36
Yes, exactly.

888
00:42:31.36 --> 00:42:32.36
You disarming them.

889
00:42:32.36 --> 00:42:33.36
But man, it's hard to do when you lose your temper.

890
00:42:33.36 --> 00:42:36.96
I answered a question the other day, I was out in a van and I answered a question.

891
00:42:36.96 --> 00:42:40.84
I was like, listen, do not take marriage advice for me.

892
00:42:40.84 --> 00:42:47.04
Because the question, well, it's a long story, but the question was about, you know,

893
00:42:47.04 --> 00:42:52.96
how do you do your job when you have all this pressure and how do you maintain your family?

894
00:42:52.96 --> 00:42:57.64
And I kind of went through the story of like, hey, you know, my family came second.

895
00:42:57.64 --> 00:42:59.40
And that's really hard for people to understand.

896
00:42:59.40 --> 00:43:00.40
And I went through the whole thing.

897
00:43:00.40 --> 00:43:01.80
And that's what I've got to the end.

898
00:43:01.80 --> 00:43:05.48
And I said, listen, don't take marriage advice for me.

899
00:43:05.48 --> 00:43:06.76
And they've kind of laughed.

900
00:43:06.76 --> 00:43:10.76
But in a situation like this.

901
00:43:10.76 --> 00:43:12.32
I actually take marriage advice for me.

902
00:43:12.32 --> 00:43:13.32
Right.

903
00:43:13.32 --> 00:43:14.32
Yeah.

904
00:43:14.32 --> 00:43:15.32
Don't attack defended positions.

905
00:43:15.32 --> 00:43:16.68
I've said that 47 times right now.

906
00:43:16.68 --> 00:43:17.68
Yeah.

907
00:43:17.68 --> 00:43:20.92
And it's not to say that you've never attacked defended.

908
00:43:20.92 --> 00:43:23.76
I don't know if you ever have it with your life.

909
00:43:23.76 --> 00:43:27.000
But I'm just saying that sounds like good objective advice.

910
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Yeah.

911
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.60
I don't, I probably haven't done that in so long.

912
00:43:30.60 --> 00:43:34.08
It's like, the tickling, we got to ask on the podcast.

913
00:43:34.08 --> 00:43:36.12
When was the, we got to ask this on the podcast?

914
00:43:36.12 --> 00:43:39.88
When is the last time that you were dug in on a position?

915
00:43:39.88 --> 00:43:41.56
How did you admit that you were wrong?

916
00:43:41.56 --> 00:43:44.44
And I was like, man, I haven't been dug in on a position in years.

917
00:43:44.44 --> 00:43:45.68
I don't even remember.

918
00:43:45.68 --> 00:43:46.68
Yeah.

919
00:43:46.68 --> 00:43:47.68
So it's the same thing here.

920
00:43:47.68 --> 00:43:50.32
One of why it's hack my wife in a defended position.

921
00:43:50.32 --> 00:43:52.60
Something that she's super crazy and passionate about.

922
00:43:52.60 --> 00:43:54.56
I'm not going near that thing.

923
00:43:54.56 --> 00:43:55.56
Yeah.

924
00:43:55.56 --> 00:43:56.56
Yeah.

925
00:43:56.56 --> 00:43:57.56
The losing your temper thing too.

926
00:43:57.56 --> 00:44:01.88
And I had learned, and I mentioned this before, where I learned about just getting

927
00:44:01.88 --> 00:44:04.44
mad in general from this book called Mind Games.

928
00:44:04.44 --> 00:44:05.92
You've seen teeny tiny little book.

929
00:44:05.92 --> 00:44:07.96
One chapter was not even one page.

930
00:44:07.96 --> 00:44:10.32
And you're first review on the podcast.

931
00:44:10.32 --> 00:44:11.52
You can be the reviewer.

932
00:44:11.52 --> 00:44:12.52
Mind games.

933
00:44:12.52 --> 00:44:16.24
Some of them were like puzzles, you know, to see how your mind works.

934
00:44:16.24 --> 00:44:19.76
Anyway, but what it did was indicate that was your playing coin fall.

935
00:44:19.76 --> 00:44:20.76
That was fun.

936
00:44:20.76 --> 00:44:21.76
Yeah.

937
00:44:21.76 --> 00:44:24.60
No, that's price is right.

938
00:44:24.60 --> 00:44:30.36
Anyway, what it indicated was that losing your temper or having anger issues, anger

939
00:44:30.36 --> 00:44:35.08
management issues, is what it was, it was a result of low self esteem.

940
00:44:35.08 --> 00:44:37.08
So exactly right.

941
00:44:37.08 --> 00:44:40.68
And that's how I always felt when you, you know, in elementary school and to me

942
00:44:40.68 --> 00:44:44.36
in school when you talk about self esteem or whatever, and slow self esteem, high self

943
00:44:44.36 --> 00:44:45.36
stuff.

944
00:44:45.36 --> 00:44:47.40
I'm being like man, that's so embarrassing to have low self esteem.

945
00:44:47.40 --> 00:44:52.12
It was like almost like a pride thing, you know, where I would even if I really felt

946
00:44:52.12 --> 00:44:57.40
like doing something or whatever, if it indicated, overtly that I had a low self esteem,

947
00:44:57.40 --> 00:44:58.72
if I didn't, I wouldn't do it.

948
00:44:58.72 --> 00:45:02.44
It was like really, like do you think that paranoia was caused by a low self esteem?

949
00:45:02.44 --> 00:45:07.04
In a way, probably because it's like the, you know, this feels switcheru.

950
00:45:07.04 --> 00:45:14.44
But so now I took that like times two where it said, look, everyone gets angry.

951
00:45:14.44 --> 00:45:19.16
It's a natural part of life, but if you have anger management issues, it is most likely

952
00:45:19.16 --> 00:45:20.52
from the low self esteem.

953
00:45:20.52 --> 00:45:23.32
So I took that as if I ever get angry, that's low self esteem.

954
00:45:23.32 --> 00:45:25.92
So man, now it'd be on my mind every single time.

955
00:45:25.92 --> 00:45:29.04
Where anytime I felt myself getting mad or being like, nope, I don't know low self esteem.

956
00:45:29.04 --> 00:45:32.04
So what that did though is train me and never to lose my temper.

957
00:45:32.04 --> 00:45:33.04
That's what I felt like.

958
00:45:33.04 --> 00:45:34.04
I felt like the back.

959
00:45:34.04 --> 00:45:40.28
I think that's the back, but but anyways, I think that's kind of the thing to check though.

960
00:45:40.28 --> 00:45:41.56
You know, where?

961
00:45:41.56 --> 00:45:45.56
Yeah, you're losing your temper all that's just like man, what's up with you?

962
00:45:45.56 --> 00:45:46.56
You're losing your temper.

963
00:45:46.56 --> 00:45:47.56
Don't lose your temper.

964
00:45:47.56 --> 00:45:49.84
That's for sure.

965
00:45:49.84 --> 00:45:53.20
Hey, you know, that splinter analogy, I gave you a man.

966
00:45:53.20 --> 00:45:56.88
Bro, I'm telling you, okay, so this one time, and it wasn't me who's Jake.

967
00:45:56.88 --> 00:45:58.36
He had a splinter, we're young.

968
00:45:58.36 --> 00:45:59.88
He had a splinter in his hand.

969
00:45:59.88 --> 00:46:03.000
We were like young, young, like, like five.

970
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.36
I know this because we're living in the specific house that I remember.

971
00:46:05.36 --> 00:46:07.04
Anyway, he did tell us about that.

972
00:46:07.04 --> 00:46:10.28
Anyway, he had a splinter and it was deep.

973
00:46:10.28 --> 00:46:12.80
So my mom was like, hey, we got to get it out.

974
00:46:12.80 --> 00:46:15.52
We got to, you know, use a like a tweezers or something.

975
00:46:15.52 --> 00:46:20.88
He's like, no, no, no, no, he put up this full on what he called it, like a pardon defense.

976
00:46:20.88 --> 00:46:25.000
We're not getting that splinter out because he's crying, he's scared, you know, all this stuff.

977
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.92
So my mom did was, all right, you know, let's don't take out the splinter.

978
00:46:27.92 --> 00:46:30.84
What he did was wait for him to go to sleep.

979
00:46:30.84 --> 00:46:34.92
You know, you just take out the splinter, it may or may not hurt for like a second, but it's out.

980
00:46:34.92 --> 00:46:35.92
Who cares?

981
00:46:35.92 --> 00:46:39.12
Wait, waited for him to go sleep, like a little nap.

982
00:46:39.12 --> 00:46:41.84
She goes in their gently, just sticks it out.

983
00:46:41.84 --> 00:46:43.28
Boom, problem solved.

984
00:46:43.28 --> 00:46:44.28
Splinter.

985
00:46:44.28 --> 00:46:45.28
Basically mama Charles.

986
00:46:45.28 --> 00:46:45.96
Flank them.

987
00:46:45.96 --> 00:46:46.64
She flanked him.

988
00:46:46.64 --> 00:46:49.56
Totally flanked them then.

989
00:46:49.56 --> 00:46:51.56
Good job, mom.

990
00:46:51.56 --> 00:46:54.64
Props to, props to mama Charles.

991
00:46:54.64 --> 00:46:55.44
Next best.

992
00:46:55.44 --> 00:46:56.64
Yes, please.

993
00:46:56.64 --> 00:46:57.64
Good Lord.

994
00:46:57.64 --> 00:47:05.60
How do you balance loyalty to your workmates and a personal sense of honor with self-interest

995
00:47:05.60 --> 00:47:07.88
when it comes to career progression?

996
00:47:07.88 --> 00:47:16.96
So this question has is giving the impression that that being loyal to your bros and

997
00:47:16.96 --> 00:47:26.92
being loyal to your workmates and having pride is the opposite of career progression, which

998
00:47:26.92 --> 00:47:32.72
is actually, I understand where that is coming from, but it's actually does not have to be true.

999
00:47:32.72 --> 00:47:35.32
It does not have to be the way you think.

1000
00:47:35.32 --> 00:47:38.16
The way you get around this is number one, you work hard.

1001
00:47:38.16 --> 00:47:39.40
That's what you do, you work hard.

1002
00:47:39.40 --> 00:47:49.000
And you do a good job, not for promotion, not for self-interest, but to help the team

1003
00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
accomplish the goal.

1004
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.76
That's what you should be working hard for.

1005
00:47:51.76 --> 00:47:55.56
That's what you should be doing a good job for.

1006
00:47:55.56 --> 00:47:58.60
And this is something I've said a bunch of times over the years.

1007
00:47:58.60 --> 00:48:03.44
I don't know if I've ever said it on the podcast before, but I should tell my guys, because

1008
00:48:03.44 --> 00:48:11.12
we'd be in some long term administrative, psychological warfare in our community, in the

1009
00:48:11.12 --> 00:48:14.28
seal teams or in our organization.

1010
00:48:14.28 --> 00:48:18.12
And I'd say, look, if we're doing the right thing for the right reason, we're going to

1011
00:48:18.12 --> 00:48:20.12
win in the end.

1012
00:48:20.12 --> 00:48:22.32
And I totally believe that to be true.

1013
00:48:22.32 --> 00:48:29.04
Now for instance, I never really cared about break or being promoted.

1014
00:48:29.04 --> 00:48:37.28
Now that being said, I actually did put in an officer package so that I could become an

1015
00:48:37.28 --> 00:48:38.28
officer.

1016
00:48:38.28 --> 00:48:39.28
Now why did I do that?

1017
00:48:39.28 --> 00:48:44.08
I didn't do that out of greed or out of hunger for power.

1018
00:48:44.08 --> 00:48:48.76
I did it because I had worked for a prior and listed officer and he made our lives really

1019
00:48:48.76 --> 00:48:50.28
good because he was a really good leader.

1020
00:48:50.28 --> 00:48:51.28
And I said, you know what?

1021
00:48:51.28 --> 00:48:56.56
I'd like to make a bunch of the guys that I know, make 16 guys in a seal between make

1022
00:48:56.56 --> 00:48:57.88
their lives better.

1023
00:48:57.88 --> 00:48:59.80
Maybe I can do that.

1024
00:48:59.80 --> 00:49:01.88
So that's sort of what led me to do it.

1025
00:49:01.88 --> 00:49:06.80
I didn't do it out of out of self-interest and greed.

1026
00:49:06.80 --> 00:49:09.84
I did it to help my bros.

1027
00:49:09.84 --> 00:49:16.32
Now that then once I got promoted, once I became an officer, then I just busted my ass to

1028
00:49:16.32 --> 00:49:17.84
do the best job I could.

1029
00:49:17.84 --> 00:49:24.56
And again, I was never concerned with being promoted, but in order to do a good job,

1030
00:49:24.56 --> 00:49:25.76
guess what I did?

1031
00:49:25.76 --> 00:49:27.24
I built relationships.

1032
00:49:27.24 --> 00:49:28.84
I took some hard jobs.

1033
00:49:28.84 --> 00:49:31.40
I followed the rules.

1034
00:49:31.40 --> 00:49:32.88
I supported the chain of command.

1035
00:49:32.88 --> 00:49:34.40
I told the party line.

1036
00:49:34.40 --> 00:49:35.60
Why did I do those things?

1037
00:49:35.60 --> 00:49:38.80
Wasn't because I was trying to get promoted because I was trying to do a good job.

1038
00:49:38.80 --> 00:49:44.08
And the more relationships I had and the more respect I had from the chain of command,

1039
00:49:44.08 --> 00:49:46.88
the more power I had to help my guys.

1040
00:49:46.88 --> 00:49:48.28
It wasn't about power for me.

1041
00:49:48.28 --> 00:49:50.76
It was about power for the good of the platoon.

1042
00:49:50.76 --> 00:49:52.48
So I could accomplish it.

1043
00:49:52.48 --> 00:49:57.56
And I knew that I believed in the broad mission that we are doing.

1044
00:49:57.56 --> 00:50:02.48
I knew that good order and discipline actually makes troops perform better.

1045
00:50:02.48 --> 00:50:04.08
I knew that.

1046
00:50:04.08 --> 00:50:13.42
And I knew that by following the rules, by supporting the chain of command, I knew that

1047
00:50:13.42 --> 00:50:20.10
towing the part, I knew that those things would build trust in the chain of command.

1048
00:50:20.10 --> 00:50:25.54
And I knew that building trust in the chain of command and being viewed positively from

1049
00:50:25.54 --> 00:50:31.62
up the chain of command meant that I would get more support from the chain of command.

1050
00:50:31.62 --> 00:50:37.90
Which once again, would make it easier for my guys to do their job.

1051
00:50:37.90 --> 00:50:38.90
Because I could get a more gear.

1052
00:50:38.90 --> 00:50:39.90
I could get them.

1053
00:50:39.90 --> 00:50:45.46
And I said they needed, I could actually legitimately protest if something came down the

1054
00:50:45.46 --> 00:50:48.38
pipe that I didn't agree with.

1055
00:50:48.38 --> 00:50:54.34
If I didn't have trust and had build a relationship with my senior officers, how could

1056
00:50:54.34 --> 00:50:56.46
I go back to my say, I don't think we should be doing this.

1057
00:50:56.46 --> 00:50:57.62
They don't know me.

1058
00:50:57.62 --> 00:50:58.98
They don't trust me.

1059
00:50:58.98 --> 00:51:02.78
But when you build that trust, then you can have a more open and honest conversation.

1060
00:51:02.78 --> 00:51:08.86
Which again is only done so that my platoon can have it easier life.

1061
00:51:08.86 --> 00:51:14.06
So they could do their job better because I believed in the mission.

1062
00:51:14.06 --> 00:51:23.78
So everything that I was doing that I was doing to make my platoon have a better go at things.

1063
00:51:23.78 --> 00:51:25.10
Make my platoon more efficient.

1064
00:51:25.10 --> 00:51:27.98
Make my platoon more effective on the battlefield.

1065
00:51:27.98 --> 00:51:32.62
All those things that I was doing, I was doing to make that.

1066
00:51:32.62 --> 00:51:36.90
And low and behold, when you're doing those things, when you're busting your ass, when

1067
00:51:36.90 --> 00:51:41.50
you're trying to make life good for your platoon, so that platoon can more effectively and

1068
00:51:41.50 --> 00:51:46.74
efficiently accomplish its mission on the battlefield, well, guess what?

1069
00:51:46.74 --> 00:51:51.50
Those are aligned with a guy that's working hard in the supporting chain of command.

1070
00:51:51.50 --> 00:51:53.70
So I would get rank number one.

1071
00:51:53.70 --> 00:51:54.70
Why?

1072
00:51:54.70 --> 00:51:57.58
Not because I was trying to get promoted and not for self interest.

1073
00:51:57.58 --> 00:52:03.26
It's because I was trying to do a good job from my boys.

1074
00:52:03.26 --> 00:52:15.98
So the bottom line is if you care about doing a good job and the doing things that will

1075
00:52:15.98 --> 00:52:20.62
help you do a good job, again, not for promotion and not for recognition, but to truly

1076
00:52:20.62 --> 00:52:28.50
do a good job, the end result is most likely going to be positive.

1077
00:52:28.50 --> 00:52:33.22
Now the caveat to this is, does that mean that you'll be the first person to get promoted?

1078
00:52:33.22 --> 00:52:35.58
No.

1079
00:52:35.58 --> 00:52:38.98
Does it mean that you are guaranteed to get promoted?

1080
00:52:38.98 --> 00:52:40.86
No.

1081
00:52:40.86 --> 00:52:44.94
Some other guy that Brown knows and took all the credit he didn't deserve and stepped on

1082
00:52:44.94 --> 00:52:48.34
of people is back to get to the top.

1083
00:52:48.34 --> 00:52:50.50
He's probably going to get promoted ahead of you.

1084
00:52:50.50 --> 00:52:51.50
He probably is.

1085
00:52:51.50 --> 00:52:53.62
It's okay.

1086
00:52:53.62 --> 00:52:54.62
It's okay.

1087
00:52:54.62 --> 00:52:57.78
I will tell you that that will come back to Hauntim.

1088
00:52:57.78 --> 00:53:02.22
Eventually, maybe not this year, maybe not next year, maybe in five years, people are

1089
00:53:02.22 --> 00:53:04.78
going to see through that eventually.

1090
00:53:04.78 --> 00:53:15.98
And you who's doing the right things for the right reasons, you will win in the end.

1091
00:53:15.98 --> 00:53:21.94
Yeah, and talk about this a lot where if you're doing it just to get the promotion, but

1092
00:53:21.94 --> 00:53:23.26
that's they're going to see that.

1093
00:53:23.26 --> 00:53:24.26
They're going to smell it.

1094
00:53:24.26 --> 00:53:25.26
Yeah.

1095
00:53:25.26 --> 00:53:28.58
And not only is the boss going to smell it on you.

1096
00:53:28.58 --> 00:53:31.42
I talked about that earlier tonight because if you were going to, if you've

1097
00:53:31.42 --> 00:53:38.54
fallen, like if you've fallen tiered to be the admiral's aid, then that was a total red flag.

1098
00:53:38.54 --> 00:53:39.54
Watch out for this guy.

1099
00:53:39.54 --> 00:53:40.82
Yeah, I see what you do.

1100
00:53:40.82 --> 00:53:42.66
Yeah, you don't want to be that guy.

1101
00:53:42.66 --> 00:53:45.34
You want to be doing the right things for the right reasons.

1102
00:53:45.34 --> 00:53:52.06
And that is how even in the long run you will get the recognition and the promotions

1103
00:53:52.06 --> 00:53:55.14
and the credit that you deserve because why wouldn't you?

1104
00:53:55.14 --> 00:53:57.34
You're a bus and you're asked to do a great job.

1105
00:53:57.34 --> 00:53:59.34
You're going to get, you're going to shine eventually.

1106
00:53:59.34 --> 00:54:05.62
Yeah, man, and if you're focused on doing the best job you can do, that's really the dynamics

1107
00:54:05.62 --> 00:54:07.62
of promotions anyway.

1108
00:54:07.62 --> 00:54:09.58
Yeah, it, it, or should be ideal.

1109
00:54:09.58 --> 00:54:10.58
It should be ideal.

1110
00:54:10.58 --> 00:54:18.54
And over time, it will be because there is somebody that Brown knows is the boss, that

1111
00:54:18.54 --> 00:54:23.42
maneuvers to take these little missions or to do things to get the recognition that

1112
00:54:23.42 --> 00:54:26.10
he's there's a guy that's doing that.

1113
00:54:26.10 --> 00:54:28.66
And they can't get promoted.

1114
00:54:28.66 --> 00:54:33.22
And you got to accept that and not succumb to it, not submit to it.

1115
00:54:33.22 --> 00:54:34.38
Because you don't want to be that guy.

1116
00:54:34.38 --> 00:54:38.58
And the long run, the guy that buss his ass that takes care of his troops that toes the

1117
00:54:38.58 --> 00:54:42.94
party line that does the right things for the right reasons is going to win in the end.

1118
00:54:42.94 --> 00:54:43.94
Yeah.

1119
00:54:43.94 --> 00:54:44.94
You got to believe in that.

1120
00:54:44.94 --> 00:54:47.10
Yeah, man, you know, guys do that in Jiu Jitsu, right sometimes.

1121
00:54:47.10 --> 00:54:48.10
No, we talk about that too.

1122
00:54:48.10 --> 00:54:49.10
Where they do.

1123
00:54:49.10 --> 00:54:50.10
They have the wrong mindset.

1124
00:54:50.10 --> 00:54:51.10
They just want that purple belt.

1125
00:54:51.10 --> 00:54:52.10
So that brown belt.

1126
00:54:52.10 --> 00:54:53.10
Whatever.

1127
00:54:53.10 --> 00:54:54.10
Yeah, they want the next belt.

1128
00:54:54.10 --> 00:54:57.10
Well, I want to tap that guy or I want to tap this guy.

1129
00:54:57.10 --> 00:54:58.34
Yeah, those are the wrong reasons.

1130
00:54:58.34 --> 00:55:05.06
Folks, yeah, and if you notice, the guys who are just in it to be the best that they

1131
00:55:05.06 --> 00:55:10.50
can be, you see them asking questions or going over some stuff on their own kind of thing,

1132
00:55:10.50 --> 00:55:13.98
where they do, they just want to learn as much as they can and get good as much as they

1133
00:55:13.98 --> 00:55:14.98
can.

1134
00:55:14.98 --> 00:55:18.58
And in the long run, those are going to be the guys that shine.

1135
00:55:18.58 --> 00:55:19.58
Yeah.

1136
00:55:19.58 --> 00:55:24.22
And then I think that's it's such a huge deal.

1137
00:55:24.22 --> 00:55:27.86
And it goes for Jiu Jitsu or even at work or whatever.

1138
00:55:27.86 --> 00:55:33.26
And if you're the guy who they can see what you're doing and you're kissing ass or

1139
00:55:33.26 --> 00:55:37.50
like the guy, okay, this is one of the most embarrassing things you can do in my opinion,

1140
00:55:37.50 --> 00:55:44.34
in Jiu Jitsu is after a promotion, you didn't get promoted and then you're overtly unhappy

1141
00:55:44.34 --> 00:55:45.34
about it.

1142
00:55:45.34 --> 00:55:50.86
And don't go one step further and say something about, I tapped that guy all the time.

1143
00:55:50.86 --> 00:55:52.06
And he got his belt.

1144
00:55:52.06 --> 00:55:53.66
Ooh, don't ever do it.

1145
00:55:53.66 --> 00:55:54.66
Don't do it.

1146
00:55:54.66 --> 00:55:55.66
Yeah, don't say it.

1147
00:55:55.66 --> 00:55:56.66
Don't do it.

1148
00:55:56.66 --> 00:55:57.66
Yeah.

1149
00:55:57.66 --> 00:56:00.74
Don't think you can ever really live that down.

1150
00:56:00.74 --> 00:56:01.74
Just unnecessary.

1151
00:56:01.74 --> 00:56:04.90
It just shows, hey guys, look at me.

1152
00:56:04.90 --> 00:56:06.38
I'm focused on the wrong thing.

1153
00:56:06.38 --> 00:56:10.70
I'm focused on like wearing a belt rather than my skill.

1154
00:56:10.70 --> 00:56:14.58
You know, I'd rather get a belt and maybe not have the skill.

1155
00:56:14.58 --> 00:56:19.46
I'd rather that than have the skill and maybe not have the belt right now.

1156
00:56:19.46 --> 00:56:20.46
That's what you're saying.

1157
00:56:20.46 --> 00:56:21.46
Oh, yeah.

1158
00:56:21.46 --> 00:56:22.46
Yeah.

1159
00:56:22.46 --> 00:56:23.46
Yeah.

1160
00:56:23.46 --> 00:56:30.46
If you don't have the belt right now, you get the belt.

1161
00:56:30.46 --> 00:56:37.46
You know, that's just part of the, you know what, it could be a long time.

1162
00:56:37.46 --> 00:56:38.46
Yeah.

1163
00:56:38.46 --> 00:56:40.46
And you know what, that's okay.

1164
00:56:40.46 --> 00:56:42.46
Oh, unless you're quiet, they need one.

1165
00:56:42.46 --> 00:56:43.46
Oh, yeah.

1166
00:56:43.46 --> 00:56:44.46
But you won't have the belt.

1167
00:56:44.46 --> 00:56:45.46
But that's the one.

1168
00:56:45.46 --> 00:56:48.46
You've got to also accept the fact that some guys can get promoted at you.

1169
00:56:48.46 --> 00:56:49.46
Good.

1170
00:56:49.46 --> 00:56:51.46
Good thing you good you tapped on before.

1171
00:56:51.46 --> 00:56:52.46
Good.

1172
00:56:52.46 --> 00:56:53.46
That's perfect.

1173
00:56:53.46 --> 00:56:54.46
Keep that up.

1174
00:56:54.46 --> 00:56:55.46
Yeah.

1175
00:56:55.46 --> 00:56:56.46
We're going to get you that belt.

1176
00:56:56.46 --> 00:56:57.46
Yeah, stop whining.

1177
00:56:57.46 --> 00:57:00.46
I heard of a guy who left the gym.

1178
00:57:00.46 --> 00:57:01.46
Yeah.

1179
00:57:01.46 --> 00:57:02.46
Argym.

1180
00:57:02.46 --> 00:57:03.46
Because he didn't get a belt.

1181
00:57:03.46 --> 00:57:05.46
And he was like, oh, I'm just going to go somewhere else.

1182
00:57:05.46 --> 00:57:06.46
Yeah.

1183
00:57:06.46 --> 00:57:07.46
That's too bad.

1184
00:57:07.46 --> 00:57:08.46
Yeah.

1185
00:57:08.46 --> 00:57:09.46
I just heard he was a story.

1186
00:57:09.46 --> 00:57:11.46
I wasn't there enough.

1187
00:57:11.46 --> 00:57:12.46
Anyway.

1188
00:57:12.46 --> 00:57:14.46
Next question.

1189
00:57:14.46 --> 00:57:15.46
Unless we have more on that one.

1190
00:57:15.46 --> 00:57:16.46
No.

1191
00:57:16.46 --> 00:57:17.46
We're good.

1192
00:57:17.46 --> 00:57:19.46
Dead horse has been beaten.

1193
00:57:19.46 --> 00:57:20.46
Yeah.

1194
00:57:20.46 --> 00:57:21.46
Don't be that guy, man.

1195
00:57:21.46 --> 00:57:22.46
Yeah.

1196
00:57:22.46 --> 00:57:25.46
Chaco on team building.

1197
00:57:25.46 --> 00:57:34.46
When leading a team, do you feel that there's any benefit to team building exercises or retreats?

1198
00:57:34.46 --> 00:57:42.46
Well, this is a interesting question that actually I feel unfairly qualified to answer

1199
00:57:42.46 --> 00:57:44.46
because we, we lay for an eye.

1200
00:57:44.46 --> 00:57:50.46
We have a little business called echelon front where that's, we work with a lot of different companies on a different

1201
00:57:50.46 --> 00:57:53.46
side range of different categories.

1202
00:57:53.46 --> 00:57:55.46
Sometimes we go in and work with a business.

1203
00:57:55.46 --> 00:57:58.46
Sometimes we're going to do a keynote speech for a business.

1204
00:57:58.46 --> 00:58:04.74
Like they'll be having a big meeting and we're going to do one keynote speech for an hour

1205
00:58:04.74 --> 00:58:06.46
and we leave and we're done.

1206
00:58:06.46 --> 00:58:11.18
But most of the time we're doing more long range stuff or we spend time with the company

1207
00:58:11.18 --> 00:58:12.18
we go in.

1208
00:58:12.18 --> 00:58:19.70
But oftentimes we do do some kind of situation where their company has decided to do some

1209
00:58:19.70 --> 00:58:25.70
kind of a leadership off-site or a team building exercise or a leadership retreat.

1210
00:58:25.70 --> 00:58:31.14
And we mostly get involved with the leadership although that does sometimes trickle down

1211
00:58:31.14 --> 00:58:36.50
to where we'll do some work with all the front line troops.

1212
00:58:36.50 --> 00:58:43.14
So we constantly see these, these leadership off-sites and we speak and or lead them.

1213
00:58:43.14 --> 00:58:48.70
Sometimes we run the whole thing and there are definitely some outstanding events.

1214
00:58:48.70 --> 00:58:54.10
And we've participated in and led some outstanding events with companies.

1215
00:58:54.10 --> 00:59:00.18
And I think one of the most important things about these off-sites is it forces the leadership

1216
00:59:00.18 --> 00:59:04.30
team to detach from the day to day firefights of what the business is.

1217
00:59:04.30 --> 00:59:08.94
No matter what, there's no businesses where the CEO and the C-suite are like sitting around

1218
00:59:08.94 --> 00:59:10.34
not doing anything.

1219
00:59:10.34 --> 00:59:14.46
Those companies don't exist, at least that I've seen.

1220
00:59:14.46 --> 00:59:15.46
You're trying to expand.

1221
00:59:15.46 --> 00:59:16.46
You're trying to grow.

1222
00:59:16.46 --> 00:59:18.70
You've got competitors making moves.

1223
00:59:18.70 --> 00:59:22.06
So you're in the fight and then you've got operational things that are happening.

1224
00:59:22.06 --> 00:59:23.06
So you're in the fight.

1225
00:59:23.06 --> 00:59:27.62
So when you do these leadership off-sites, it's good that you get them to focus on some

1226
00:59:27.62 --> 00:59:32.98
other development and some whatever issues they're having and areas where they can improve.

1227
00:59:32.98 --> 00:59:36.78
So it gives them the opportunity to focus on those things.

1228
00:59:36.78 --> 00:59:45.06
And also gives them the opportunity to self-assess as a team, how they're doing and themselves

1229
00:59:45.06 --> 00:59:49.22
as leaders, how they're doing.

1230
00:59:49.22 --> 00:59:55.22
And when I talk to people about leadership and teamwork and the shortfalls and the pitfalls

1231
00:59:55.22 --> 01:00:00.38
that exist and then when they hear me talk about it, they recognize their own weaknesses.

1232
01:00:00.38 --> 01:00:05.30
Every time I get done they go, man, when you were talking about, you know, when you were

1233
01:00:05.30 --> 01:00:09.74
talking about ego, sometimes I think I let my ego get in the way or the way when you were

1234
01:00:09.74 --> 01:00:13.22
talking about cover movement, I don't think I, when you're talking about ownership,

1235
01:00:13.22 --> 01:00:20.02
they see areas of their own weaknesses and they see where they can improve.

1236
01:00:20.02 --> 01:00:24.74
And then when you get the whole team that's all learning that same information, they're

1237
01:00:24.74 --> 01:00:27.98
all doing that same self-assessment.

1238
01:00:27.98 --> 01:00:35.38
And then the whole leadership team gets aligned behind the same leadership principles of

1239
01:00:35.38 --> 01:00:38.14
ownership and humility and cover movement.

1240
01:00:38.14 --> 01:00:42.30
Simple decentralized command and all those things that I talk about, that is extremely

1241
01:00:42.30 --> 01:00:43.30
powerful.

1242
01:00:43.30 --> 01:00:46.90
It is extremely powerful.

1243
01:00:46.90 --> 01:00:53.82
And we see really drastic turnaround with the companies that we work with and it's awesome.

1244
01:00:53.82 --> 01:00:55.22
It's awesome to see.

1245
01:00:55.22 --> 01:01:00.46
And then one thing that we do when we work more in depth with the company, we do our

1246
01:01:00.46 --> 01:01:05.54
own leadership offsights where we do simulated combat.

1247
01:01:05.54 --> 01:01:10.34
And I know it sounds, it sounds, if I wouldn't have done it so many times, I would be

1248
01:01:10.34 --> 01:01:12.66
surprised that it's possible.

1249
01:01:12.66 --> 01:01:19.78
But we take either paint guns, paint ball guns or airsoft guns and we teach them the basic

1250
01:01:19.78 --> 01:01:23.54
shooting principles and we teach them some basic small unit tactics.

1251
01:01:23.54 --> 01:01:24.90
And then we go and perform missions.

1252
01:01:24.90 --> 01:01:26.34
We have them perform missions.

1253
01:01:26.34 --> 01:01:30.94
And every time they got eight guys, they got 10 guys, they got 12 guys, girls, whatever

1254
01:01:30.94 --> 01:01:34.90
in their group and they go in a salt attack.

1255
01:01:34.90 --> 01:01:36.38
They come up with a plan.

1256
01:01:36.38 --> 01:01:37.38
They go out.

1257
01:01:37.38 --> 01:01:39.74
We put one person in charge.

1258
01:01:39.74 --> 01:01:41.54
That person has to lead a mission.

1259
01:01:41.54 --> 01:01:49.62
And they what they theorized in the classroom, they now get to put to the test and they

1260
01:01:49.62 --> 01:01:52.62
learn those lessons very, very clearly.

1261
01:01:52.62 --> 01:01:57.38
You know, we'd see a guy that would be a really strong leader.

1262
01:01:57.38 --> 01:02:00.06
And he was, okay, I'm in charge this run.

1263
01:02:00.06 --> 01:02:01.06
Here's what I'm going to do.

1264
01:02:01.06 --> 01:02:02.06
Here's the way the plan is.

1265
01:02:02.06 --> 01:02:03.06
Put down.

1266
01:02:03.06 --> 01:02:04.06
You're going to do this.

1267
01:02:04.06 --> 01:02:05.06
You're going to do this.

1268
01:02:05.06 --> 01:02:06.70
You see that micro management start.

1269
01:02:06.70 --> 01:02:11.66
And then as soon as they start the operation, everyone is expecting to get micro managed.

1270
01:02:11.66 --> 01:02:13.02
So no one's thinking on their own.

1271
01:02:13.02 --> 01:02:16.22
So now you get to decentralize a lack of decentralized command.

1272
01:02:16.22 --> 01:02:18.22
And everything goes sideways and nobody does anything.

1273
01:02:18.22 --> 01:02:21.02
Because I'll be waiting to be told what to do.

1274
01:02:21.02 --> 01:02:26.86
So that's an example of the kind of things that people learn.

1275
01:02:26.86 --> 01:02:30.42
So with all that, yes, absolutely.

1276
01:02:30.42 --> 01:02:35.90
We, you know, I've been to and we run some pretty awesome team building exercises and

1277
01:02:35.90 --> 01:02:39.78
retreats and leadership off sites that are better great.

1278
01:02:39.78 --> 01:02:43.66
And we've seen awesome results from a wall.

1279
01:02:43.66 --> 01:02:50.14
I've also sat through some off sites that are not that effective.

1280
01:02:50.14 --> 01:02:53.66
You know, you get situations where people don't open up or there's no exchange.

1281
01:02:53.66 --> 01:02:57.78
Or you get these team building exercises that some people set up.

1282
01:02:57.78 --> 01:03:02.02
And there's some kind of physical or mental challenge.

1283
01:03:02.02 --> 01:03:09.54
And while they might be hard and they might take some teamwork to perform, they don't break

1284
01:03:09.54 --> 01:03:12.10
the paradigm that the company is in.

1285
01:03:12.10 --> 01:03:16.98
So then when the bleeding through that challenge, or whatever it is, whether it's a,

1286
01:03:16.98 --> 01:03:20.98
some kind of a p-teats, some kind of physical training, or some kind of a boat race, or

1287
01:03:20.98 --> 01:03:24.70
something like that, they'll lead through that challenge the way they always lead the way

1288
01:03:24.70 --> 01:03:25.70
they currently lead.

1289
01:03:25.70 --> 01:03:29.78
So nothing has learned and nothing has gained and no leadership advancement has been made.

1290
01:03:29.78 --> 01:03:35.70
And all they've done is actually, all they've actually done is reinforce the bad leadership

1291
01:03:35.70 --> 01:03:38.94
situation that they already have.

1292
01:03:38.94 --> 01:03:44.02
So that's one of the things that I've seen that can be problematic.

1293
01:03:44.02 --> 01:03:47.18
And that's why we've gone to the direction that we go.

1294
01:03:47.18 --> 01:03:55.10
Where we really focus on, let's look at leadership and the team working together, how what

1295
01:03:55.10 --> 01:03:59.58
the leadership dynamics are, what are weaknesses are, what we see, where we uncover the

1296
01:03:59.58 --> 01:04:03.42
friction, where we see the team not working well together, where we see the leaders not

1297
01:04:03.42 --> 01:04:07.26
stepping up and leading, where we see the leaders' ego is getting away.

1298
01:04:07.26 --> 01:04:10.86
I mean, there's so many things that we uncover and find.

1299
01:04:10.86 --> 01:04:14.70
It's phenomenal and it really does make it fun for us.

1300
01:04:14.70 --> 01:04:23.10
Because every time you see a new leadership team, it's like diagnosing a patient.

1301
01:04:23.10 --> 01:04:25.98
And you look at the problems that they're having, they say, oh, well, you know what?

1302
01:04:25.98 --> 01:04:27.22
Try this over here.

1303
01:04:27.22 --> 01:04:31.14
Like this off a little bit, and the next thing, you've got that patient up and running

1304
01:04:31.14 --> 01:04:32.70
and they're winning.

1305
01:04:32.70 --> 01:04:34.70
We're like a mechanic.

1306
01:04:34.70 --> 01:04:35.70
We grab the car right?

1307
01:04:35.70 --> 01:04:36.70
Yeah.

1308
01:04:36.70 --> 01:04:37.70
Thoughts.

1309
01:04:37.70 --> 01:04:41.62
Yeah, some of those leadership are not leadership necessarily, but these team building

1310
01:04:41.62 --> 01:04:46.66
retreats to sometimes it seems like whoever organized them really wasn't focusing on

1311
01:04:46.66 --> 01:04:47.66
results.

1312
01:04:47.66 --> 01:04:51.42
They were just focusing on our annual retreat.

1313
01:04:51.42 --> 01:04:57.18
So they make it in the Bahamas and all these activities are kind of fun.

1314
01:04:57.18 --> 01:05:00.26
And everyone's an all-infinite, a administrative thing or something.

1315
01:05:00.26 --> 01:05:01.94
Yeah, and fun can be part of it.

1316
01:05:01.94 --> 01:05:03.66
There's bonding that happens.

1317
01:05:03.66 --> 01:05:07.50
There's getting to know each other and that's always positive.

1318
01:05:07.50 --> 01:05:10.82
But if you're, I'm all about having fun.

1319
01:05:10.82 --> 01:05:13.98
I'm all about bonding, but I'm even more about learning.

1320
01:05:13.98 --> 01:05:22.38
I'm even more about improving the people we work with, the guys and girls that we work with.

1321
01:05:22.38 --> 01:05:24.42
I want them to be better of leaders.

1322
01:05:24.42 --> 01:05:25.42
Right.

1323
01:05:25.42 --> 01:05:26.42
That's what I want.

1324
01:05:26.42 --> 01:05:27.14
Yeah, that's what I want.

1325
01:05:27.14 --> 01:05:32.38
So yeah, sure, do I want them to get some team challenges?

1326
01:05:32.38 --> 01:05:36.50
Yes, but like I said, I don't want that just reinforce the paradigm of the third

1327
01:05:36.50 --> 01:05:39.82
already and the leadership paradigm of the third already in.

1328
01:05:39.82 --> 01:05:41.62
I want them to improve.

1329
01:05:41.62 --> 01:05:50.34
So let's actually break down and look and analyze and diagnose what the issues are.

1330
01:05:50.34 --> 01:05:51.78
And then let's solve.

1331
01:05:51.78 --> 01:05:57.74
And you know, it's not always, it's not always that these teams go in and they're, you

1332
01:05:57.74 --> 01:06:00.18
know, we don't get hired by companies that are failing.

1333
01:06:00.18 --> 01:06:04.48
In fact, most of the time, we get hired by companies that are doing well, that want to do

1334
01:06:04.48 --> 01:06:05.48
better.

1335
01:06:05.48 --> 01:06:13.14
So when I say we diagnose what the problem is, it's not a problem where it's causing the

1336
01:06:13.14 --> 01:06:18.14
company to failure, but it's a friction point where it is holding the company back from

1337
01:06:18.14 --> 01:06:24.50
really reaching the best, the next level and going from being a really good company or

1338
01:06:24.50 --> 01:06:28.38
even an outstanding company to the best in class company.

1339
01:06:28.38 --> 01:06:29.54
Gotcha.

1340
01:06:29.54 --> 01:06:33.46
So it's like a multi-vitamin, not a pink killer.

1341
01:06:33.46 --> 01:06:34.46
Yes.

1342
01:06:34.46 --> 01:06:36.66
You know, that's not my another.

1343
01:06:36.66 --> 01:06:38.46
I read that somewhere.

1344
01:06:38.46 --> 01:06:40.06
You know, the micromanaging thing.

1345
01:06:40.06 --> 01:06:41.06
Yes.

1346
01:06:41.06 --> 01:06:46.14
And that's, it's funny because you're the first person that I've heard say that this, where

1347
01:06:46.14 --> 01:06:48.10
you said, those start micromanaging.

1348
01:06:48.10 --> 01:06:53.26
And then all of a sudden, the people getting micromanaged, expect to get micromanaged, so

1349
01:06:53.26 --> 01:06:54.26
they stop thinking, right?

1350
01:06:54.26 --> 01:06:55.26
100%.

1351
01:06:55.26 --> 01:06:56.86
So yeah, that happens all the way.

1352
01:06:56.86 --> 01:06:58.90
And it goes the other way, too.

1353
01:06:58.90 --> 01:07:01.14
If you come to me and you say, hey, Jockel, how do you want me to do this?

1354
01:07:01.14 --> 01:07:03.34
And I go, figure it out.

1355
01:07:03.34 --> 01:07:04.98
And you say, hey, boss, can you show me how to do this?

1356
01:07:04.98 --> 01:07:06.62
I say, figure it out.

1357
01:07:06.62 --> 01:07:11.34
When we get in the field, you're going to know that I expect you to figure it out.

1358
01:07:11.34 --> 01:07:12.34
Right.

1359
01:07:12.34 --> 01:07:13.34
Yeah, man.

1360
01:07:13.34 --> 01:07:18.06
Like when I, when I drive with my life, she'll start micromanaging like how I drive.

1361
01:07:18.06 --> 01:07:25.86
Like get in this lane or, you know, just, you're going to slow or too fast, whatever,

1362
01:07:25.86 --> 01:07:26.86
too slow typically.

1363
01:07:26.86 --> 01:07:27.86
Yeah, it's cold.

1364
01:07:27.86 --> 01:07:28.86
But here's the thing.

1365
01:07:28.86 --> 01:07:30.86
I'm not going to lose my temper.

1366
01:07:30.86 --> 01:07:34.98
You know, I don't think, yeah, front seat in her case, but yeah, man, for sure.

1367
01:07:34.98 --> 01:07:37.66
And I'm not going to lose my temper, I'll be like, okay, but that's what I do.

1368
01:07:37.66 --> 01:07:39.38
I shut down my brain.

1369
01:07:39.38 --> 01:07:44.26
And then so one time Jada was riding with us and he was, uh, now he was actually

1370
01:07:44.26 --> 01:07:46.10
I was micromanaging Jade.

1371
01:07:46.10 --> 01:07:48.42
And he put it in these good terms, which I thought were good.

1372
01:07:48.42 --> 01:07:54.66
He said either be the navigator, 100% because he stopped thinking, you know, or don't

1373
01:07:54.66 --> 01:07:55.66
be it at all.

1374
01:07:55.66 --> 01:07:58.86
You can't just start chiming in when you think I'm going to slow.

1375
01:07:58.86 --> 01:08:03.46
You know, otherwise, yeah, I don't want to, I'm, if Sarah's yelling at me, hey, you're

1376
01:08:03.46 --> 01:08:06.26
going too slow, I'm going to be like, okay, how fast you want me to go?

1377
01:08:06.26 --> 01:08:07.98
I'll go that fast.

1378
01:08:07.98 --> 01:08:12.42
So if you're navigating on the map, you're going to have to tell me every turn to make.

1379
01:08:12.42 --> 01:08:13.98
Don't say, hey, you're going to make this right.

1380
01:08:13.98 --> 01:08:14.98
And then I make the right thing.

1381
01:08:14.98 --> 01:08:18.90
Just sign off, you know, because you're anticipating the micromanage.

1382
01:08:18.90 --> 01:08:19.90
Exactly right, man.

1383
01:08:19.90 --> 01:08:23.62
And I think it kind of goes automatically, you know, you got to put in a lot of

1384
01:08:23.62 --> 01:08:26.50
methods for where you knew that Sarah never said anything.

1385
01:08:26.50 --> 01:08:27.34
You and you got in the car.

1386
01:08:27.34 --> 01:08:30.98
All me, you know that you had to have the route prepped before you got in the vehicle.

1387
01:08:30.98 --> 01:08:34.78
Well, we might go a little bit too slow, but still, man, what it's all me is first thinking

1388
01:08:34.78 --> 01:08:38.42
goes, yeah, man, don't micromanage.

1389
01:08:38.42 --> 01:08:44.66
Or when you micromanage don't expect them to just all of a sudden start making creative

1390
01:08:44.66 --> 01:08:45.66
decisions.

1391
01:08:45.66 --> 01:08:50.30
It's just hard, it's hard for it to work that way, man.

1392
01:08:50.30 --> 01:08:52.70
All right, next question.

1393
01:08:52.70 --> 01:08:54.70
This is the last one.

1394
01:08:54.70 --> 01:09:06.34
Joko, could you tell us any possible regrets or things you'd done differently?

1395
01:09:06.34 --> 01:09:13.26
Something you'd wished you'd learned sooner?

1396
01:09:13.26 --> 01:09:23.18
That's things I could have done differently, things I wish I learned sooner.

1397
01:09:23.18 --> 01:09:27.74
Of course, there are things I wish I learned sooner.

1398
01:09:27.74 --> 01:09:38.70
There's so much knowledge out there, so much information, so many ways to get better.

1399
01:09:38.70 --> 01:09:45.02
So we make, we make so many mistakes.

1400
01:09:45.02 --> 01:09:48.94
We're the product of our mistakes.

1401
01:09:48.94 --> 01:09:55.66
And oftentimes, the lesson is sitting there right in front of our face.

1402
01:09:55.66 --> 01:09:59.90
It's there to be learned, but we miss it and we don't pay attention to it or we think

1403
01:09:59.90 --> 01:10:11.50
we know better until it punches us in the face.

1404
01:10:11.50 --> 01:10:17.78
And the most important thing to learn is that we have so much to learn.

1405
01:10:17.78 --> 01:10:19.38
We all do.

1406
01:10:19.38 --> 01:10:30.50
And we can learn from school and from people and from experience and we learn from life.

1407
01:10:30.50 --> 01:10:34.50
But you have to process the information.

1408
01:10:34.50 --> 01:10:35.90
You have to absorb it.

1409
01:10:35.90 --> 01:10:37.62
You have to accept it.

1410
01:10:37.62 --> 01:10:40.26
You have to open your mind.

1411
01:10:40.26 --> 01:10:49.34
You've got to free your mind so that you can learn and make real progress.

1412
01:10:49.34 --> 01:11:02.78
And as far as regrets and things I wish I would have done differently, of course.

1413
01:11:02.78 --> 01:11:09.58
Hindsight is 2020 and looking back, of course, who wouldn't want to take another go

1414
01:11:09.58 --> 01:11:15.54
with something and improve on the first try by doing it again.

1415
01:11:15.54 --> 01:11:22.54
And why not do it again and again and again and why not just do it over and over again until

1416
01:11:22.54 --> 01:11:28.78
you have it perfect.

1417
01:11:28.78 --> 01:11:35.38
But the fact is you don't get that chance.

1418
01:11:35.38 --> 01:11:38.50
You get one shot.

1419
01:11:38.50 --> 01:11:42.50
One shot at this gig right here.

1420
01:11:42.50 --> 01:11:45.82
One life.

1421
01:11:45.82 --> 01:11:48.62
That's all you've got.

1422
01:11:48.62 --> 01:11:50.62
And regret.

1423
01:11:50.62 --> 01:11:56.42
And in of itself, it's worthless.

1424
01:11:56.42 --> 01:11:58.58
It does nothing for you.

1425
01:11:58.58 --> 01:12:05.82
In fact, the only valuable thing in regret is the lesson you learned.

1426
01:12:05.82 --> 01:12:10.30
The knowledge that you gained.

1427
01:12:10.30 --> 01:12:14.30
But walking around filled with regret.

1428
01:12:14.30 --> 01:12:18.30
Get you nothing.

1429
01:12:18.30 --> 01:12:22.70
So learn and move on.

1430
01:12:22.70 --> 01:12:24.54
Don't let regret.

1431
01:12:24.54 --> 01:12:25.54
Be chewed down.

1432
01:12:25.54 --> 01:12:27.74
Don't be a slave to regret.

1433
01:12:27.74 --> 01:12:29.74
No.

1434
01:12:29.74 --> 01:12:31.22
Let it teach you.

1435
01:12:31.22 --> 01:12:36.30
Let it make you better.

1436
01:12:36.30 --> 01:12:42.78
Let the fear of regret fuel you to take action today.

1437
01:12:42.78 --> 01:12:52.58
Now to take action now to become a better person.

1438
01:12:52.58 --> 01:12:57.02
Not filled with regret.

1439
01:12:57.02 --> 01:13:03.66
But filled with knowledge.

1440
01:13:03.66 --> 01:13:18.86
And strength and power and filled with life.

1441
01:13:18.86 --> 01:13:25.54
And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1442
01:13:25.54 --> 01:13:28.54
No regrets.

1443
01:13:28.54 --> 01:13:38.54
Not only knowledge.

1444
01:13:38.54 --> 01:13:39.26
And that's what we are striving for on this podcast to gain knowledge.

1445
01:13:39.26 --> 01:13:43.74
So we can improve ourselves and live better lives.

1446
01:13:43.74 --> 01:13:48.18

01:14:30.62 --> 01:14:31.98
You're buying it anyways.

1467
01:14:31.98 --> 01:14:38.14
I know you love Amazon because I love Amazon because it is a squared away system that delivers

1468
01:14:38.14 --> 01:14:41.78

They're taking their money and giving it to support the jockel podcast which is pretty

1474
01:15:00.86 --> 01:15:01.86
impressive.

1475
01:15:01.86 --> 01:15:03.06
That's much appreciated.

1476
01:15:03.06 --> 01:15:07.30
Yeah, so if you're buying some duct tape or some the key the challenge is remembering

1477
01:15:07.30 --> 01:15:08.30
to go.

1478
01:15:08.30 --> 01:15:09.30
Right.

1479
01:15:09.30 --> 01:15:11.14
The jockelpodcast.com.

1480
01:15:11.14 --> 01:15:12.50
Why would you say duct tape?

1481
01:15:12.50 --> 01:15:14.70
Do you get a lot of duct tape from Amazon?

1482
01:15:14.70 --> 01:15:17.18
No, I've gotten, yeah.

1483
01:15:17.18 --> 01:15:20.26
You always say if you need duct tape man go to Amazon.

1484
01:15:20.26 --> 01:15:23.94
Well I said it once and it kind of stuck duct tape.

1485
01:15:23.94 --> 01:15:24.94
It.

1486
01:15:24.94 --> 01:15:28.38
Anyway, I saw you watch when Guy wrote, actually I still watch when Guy wrote all the

1487
01:15:28.38 --> 01:15:29.38
time.

1488
01:15:29.38 --> 01:15:30.38
That was his thing, that duct tape.

1489
01:15:30.38 --> 01:15:31.38
Yeah.

1490
01:15:31.38 --> 01:15:32.38
Don't go anywhere without it.

1491
01:15:32.38 --> 01:15:35.26
In the military we call it rigor tape.

1492
01:15:35.26 --> 01:15:36.26
Yeah.

1493
01:15:36.26 --> 01:15:40.90
And some people call it 120 mile an hour tape but I never called it that one time.

1494
01:15:40.90 --> 01:15:42.42
But we call it rigor tape.

1495
01:15:42.42 --> 01:15:43.42
Yeah.

1496
01:15:43.42 --> 01:15:44.42
Yeah.

1497
01:15:44.42 --> 01:15:47.30
I got some black rigor tape.

1498
01:15:47.30 --> 01:15:52.06
On the last, if you're getting some or anything on Amazon.com just try if you can just

1499
01:15:52.06 --> 01:15:54.22
remember to go to jockelpodcast.com first.

1500
01:15:54.22 --> 01:15:59.42
Click on the Amazon link in booms, automatic supporting podcast and we thank you for that.

1501
01:15:59.42 --> 01:16:02.42
I think for that jockel thing to do.

1502
01:16:02.42 --> 01:16:09.70
And while you're at jockel store if you like any of the shirts, go ahead grab one or

1503
01:16:09.70 --> 01:16:11.46
a coffee mug or a sticker.

1504
01:16:11.46 --> 01:16:12.86
That's a good way to support.

1505
01:16:12.86 --> 01:16:16.42
This shirt that you're wearing tonight is a little bit new isn't it?

1506
01:16:16.42 --> 01:16:17.42
It's a little new.

1507
01:16:17.42 --> 01:16:18.42
Yes, the newest one.

1508
01:16:18.42 --> 01:16:19.78
It's all looks very dare.

1509
01:16:19.78 --> 01:16:22.54
If you're watching on YouTube.

1510
01:16:22.54 --> 01:16:27.66
If you're not watching on YouTube, the front of the shirt, it's a black on black shirt.

1511
01:16:27.66 --> 01:16:28.66
Yeah.

1512
01:16:28.66 --> 01:16:32.34
And then the black on the front it says, know the darkness.

1513
01:16:32.34 --> 01:16:35.78
You know, actually ironically if you're watching on YouTube, you might not even be able

1514
01:16:35.78 --> 01:16:38.42
to see know the darkness.

1515
01:16:38.42 --> 01:16:42.70
And let's say and I mentioned this before this when we made this one, there's that added

1516
01:16:42.70 --> 01:16:44.42
layer where it's dark.

1517
01:16:44.42 --> 01:16:45.42
The shirt is for you.

1518
01:16:45.42 --> 01:16:47.42
It's not to show everyone.

1519
01:16:47.42 --> 01:16:48.42
Oh, look at me.

1520
01:16:48.42 --> 01:16:49.42
Look at my cool shirt.

1521
01:16:49.42 --> 01:16:50.42
The shirt is for you.

1522
01:16:50.42 --> 01:16:51.42
You know it's there.

1523
01:16:51.42 --> 01:16:52.42
And on the back it's got some madness.

1524
01:16:52.42 --> 01:16:53.42
Some darkness.

1525
01:16:53.42 --> 01:16:54.42
Some dark.

1526
01:16:54.42 --> 01:16:55.42
It's dark.

1527
01:16:55.42 --> 01:16:56.42
Yeah.

1528
01:16:56.42 --> 01:17:00.42
So that's what you do the shirts, right?

1529
01:17:00.42 --> 01:17:02.42
I mean, so this must, what did that?

1530
01:17:02.42 --> 01:17:05.42
Well, like, we've talked about a lot of stuff.

1531
01:17:05.42 --> 01:17:07.42
Why did you, why did you go with the darkness?

1532
01:17:07.42 --> 01:17:09.42
Why did you, why was that important to you?

1533
01:17:09.42 --> 01:17:11.42
Because that was the main theme.

1534
01:17:11.42 --> 01:17:14.42
Remember like when you, when you started it or what?

1535
01:17:14.42 --> 01:17:15.42
Yeah.

1536
01:17:15.42 --> 01:17:16.42
Well, okay.

1537
01:17:16.42 --> 01:17:20.82
When Jockel started the main theme and still is the main theme where it goes into all

1538
01:17:20.82 --> 01:17:25.22
these dark books and concepts.

1539
01:17:25.22 --> 01:17:30.02
And then every time, even Tim Kennedy, when we asked him, oh, or one of the questions was like,

1540
01:17:30.02 --> 01:17:34.30
hey, how do you, you know, reconcile, you know, being happier, anything that when you

1541
01:17:34.30 --> 01:17:36.50
see so much darkness.

1542
01:17:36.50 --> 01:17:42.18
And it actually intensifies your happiness because you can recognize the good stuff.

1543
01:17:42.18 --> 01:17:46.74
So, know the darkness so you can see the light.

1544
01:17:46.74 --> 01:17:48.74
That's kind of the phrase there, right?

1545
01:17:48.74 --> 01:17:51.74
So you can appreciate good things way more when you know bad things.

1546
01:17:51.74 --> 01:17:53.98
And that goes for everything, really.

1547
01:17:53.98 --> 01:17:59.38
So you didn't make a sure that said, be happy.

1548
01:17:59.38 --> 01:18:02.78
The light is with us because you could have made that, I guess.

1549
01:18:02.78 --> 01:18:03.78
Yeah.

1550
01:18:03.78 --> 01:18:06.82
Kind of inconsistent though with the whole feel.

1551
01:18:06.82 --> 01:18:08.06
I mean.

1552
01:18:08.06 --> 01:18:12.82
And the bottom line is if you're surrounded by all the happiness, it starts to fade.

1553
01:18:12.82 --> 01:18:13.82
Right?

1554
01:18:13.82 --> 01:18:14.82
Yeah.

1555
01:18:14.82 --> 01:18:15.82
Yeah.

1556
01:18:15.82 --> 01:18:16.82
Exactly.

1557
01:18:16.82 --> 01:18:17.82
So, will us not make a happy shirt?

1558
01:18:17.82 --> 01:18:18.82
Let's make a dark shirt.

1559
01:18:18.82 --> 01:18:19.82
Yeah.

1560
01:18:19.82 --> 01:18:21.10
Maybe we'll make a happy shirt in the future.

1561
01:18:21.10 --> 01:18:24.70
But I'm saying, for right now, that's where you were feeling.

1562
01:18:24.70 --> 01:18:25.70
That's what it's feeling.

1563
01:18:25.70 --> 01:18:26.70
Yeah.

1564
01:18:26.70 --> 01:18:27.70
I thought it was appropriate.

1565
01:18:27.70 --> 01:18:29.70
I think it came out good, man.

1566
01:18:29.70 --> 01:18:30.70
I dig it.

1567
01:18:30.70 --> 01:18:32.70
There you go.

1568
01:18:32.70 --> 01:18:35.14
Or if you like any of the other ones, just plenty of cool freedom.

1569
01:18:35.14 --> 01:18:36.14
That was a cool one too.

1570
01:18:36.14 --> 01:18:37.14
I think.

1571
01:18:37.14 --> 01:18:37.14
Yeah.

1572
01:18:37.14 --> 01:18:39.82
I don't know what you're at on it.

1573
01:18:39.82 --> 01:18:41.10
Anyway, that you can see on whatever.

1574
01:18:41.10 --> 01:18:46.86
I still haven't seen a live in the wild.

1575
01:18:46.86 --> 01:18:49.18
I haven't seen travel all the time.

1576
01:18:49.18 --> 01:18:51.22
I haven't seen it a trooper yet.

1577
01:18:51.22 --> 01:18:52.86
Just represent.

1578
01:18:52.86 --> 01:18:53.86
Yeah.

1579
01:18:53.86 --> 01:18:55.46
I mean, so, so forward to it.

1580
01:18:55.46 --> 01:18:56.46
Yeah.

1581
01:18:56.46 --> 01:19:00.10
I've never, I've never, I've taken a selfie.

1582
01:19:00.10 --> 01:19:01.46
But I think I might do a selfie.

1583
01:19:01.46 --> 01:19:07.10
If I see a person in the wild trooper out there, just represent in hardcore and

1584
01:19:07.10 --> 01:19:11.18
an airport somewhere, coming straight up, we're gonna do some burpees and then see.

1585
01:19:11.18 --> 01:19:16.02
You know what, yeah, but I've seen them here.

1586
01:19:16.02 --> 01:19:17.02
Yeah, and San Diego.

1587
01:19:17.02 --> 01:19:18.62
But those are our people.

1588
01:19:18.62 --> 01:19:19.62
We know everybody.

1589
01:19:19.62 --> 01:19:22.42
Yeah, but I've seen one where I didn't know.

1590
01:19:22.42 --> 01:19:27.62
I didn't know that, you know, that, like, this guy, that person.

1591
01:19:27.62 --> 01:19:28.62
I knew him.

1592
01:19:28.62 --> 01:19:29.62
I know him.

1593
01:19:29.62 --> 01:19:31.82
But I didn't know he got a shirt and stuff.

1594
01:19:31.82 --> 01:19:36.34
I want to be an Indianapolis, or I want to be in Philadelphia.

1595
01:19:36.34 --> 01:19:40.06
I'd be walking down the street and see some guys as a represent in hardcore.

1596
01:19:40.06 --> 01:19:42.06
Right there in the street.

1597
01:19:42.06 --> 01:19:43.06
That'll be awesome.

1598
01:19:43.06 --> 01:19:47.78
Well, I can attest that with the online stuff I've seen, the people representing, they

1599
01:19:47.78 --> 01:19:49.34
are representing hardcore.

1600
01:19:49.34 --> 01:19:50.34
Yeah.

1601
01:19:50.34 --> 01:19:51.34
Anything else?

1602
01:19:51.34 --> 01:19:53.34
No, that's it.

1603
01:19:53.34 --> 01:19:55.58
If you like it, just grab one if you want.

1604
01:19:55.58 --> 01:19:56.58
Right on.

1605
01:19:56.58 --> 01:20:04.86
Well, as always, if you want to continue this conversation with us, all these questions we

1606
01:20:04.86 --> 01:20:08.82
answered tonight, never from you guys, they're from the troopers.

1607
01:20:08.82 --> 01:20:09.82
They're from you also.

1608
01:20:09.82 --> 01:20:11.26
Thank you for doing that.

1609
01:20:11.26 --> 01:20:15.46
We are on the interwebs on Twitter.

1610
01:20:15.46 --> 01:20:18.94
Echo Charles is at Echo Charles.

1611
01:20:18.94 --> 01:20:20.86
And I am at Jocca Willink.

1612
01:20:20.86 --> 01:20:23.50
We're also on the Facebook and Instagram.

1613
01:20:23.50 --> 01:20:28.90
If you care, that's where we are.

1614
01:20:28.90 --> 01:20:31.50
And we're trying to get better.

1615
01:20:31.50 --> 01:20:41.98
And you can join us there as we seek knowledge together and get after it.

1616
01:20:41.98 --> 01:21:06.42
So until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
