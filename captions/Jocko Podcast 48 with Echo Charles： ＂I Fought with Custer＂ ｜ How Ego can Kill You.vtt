00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.56
This is Jockel Podcast number 48 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.

2
00:00:12.56 --> 00:00:19.84
We found General Custer on the Bluffs and near him lay the bodies of 11 of his officers.

3
00:00:19.84 --> 00:00:29.28
As a tribute to his bravery, the Indians had not mutilated General Custer and he lay as if a sleep.

4
00:00:29.28 --> 00:00:36.72
But all the other men had been most brutally mangled and had been stripped of their clothing.

5
00:00:36.72 --> 00:00:47.92
Many of their skulls had been crushed in, eyes had been torn from their sockets, hands, feet, arms, legs, and noses had been wrenched off.

6
00:00:47.92 --> 00:00:53.12
Many had their flesh cut and stripped the entire length of their bodies.

7
00:00:53.12 --> 00:01:05.36
And there were others whose limbs were closely perforated with bullet holes, showing that the torture had been inflicted while the wretched victims were yet alive.

8
00:01:07.36 --> 00:01:15.12
There were 29 enlisted men missing from the field of blood and they undoubtedly had been taken prisoners and perished at the stake

9
00:01:15.12 --> 00:01:23.04
while the Indians were celebrating their scalp dance on the night of the 25th in sight of my camp.

10
00:01:24.40 --> 00:01:35.84
Lying almost at Custer's feet was young read, a nephew of the generals who had been visiting him at Fort Lincoln and who had pleaded to go on the campaign

11
00:01:35.84 --> 00:01:41.36
where this handsome lad of 19 met such an untimely fate.

12
00:01:41.36 --> 00:01:47.68
Within a few feet of the general lay his two brothers, Boston and Tom.

13
00:01:48.96 --> 00:01:53.84
There was in the whole army no more popular man than Galant Tom Custer.

14
00:01:54.56 --> 00:02:02.56
He was young, handsome, a prince of good fellows and full of that bravery that even characterized the Custers.

15
00:02:02.56 --> 00:02:10.32
He had served with distinction during the war and had fought frequently before

16
00:02:11.52 --> 00:02:14.000
been engaged in Indian fights.

17
00:02:15.84 --> 00:02:21.12
As we approached him, we were horrified to see that his body had been opened and is heart torn out.

18
00:02:22.64 --> 00:02:27.44
Thus I know that the vengeance of rain in the face had been at work.

19
00:02:27.44 --> 00:02:34.40
Several years before rain in the face had murdered two white men of our fort and afterwards

20
00:02:34.40 --> 00:02:39.84
boasted of it in the reservation. He was arrested and brought to trial by Tom Custer.

21
00:02:40.48 --> 00:02:45.36
But before the time appointed for his case had arrived, the Wiley Indian had escaped sending

22
00:02:45.36 --> 00:02:50.24
back word to Captain Tom that he would be revenge by cutting out his captors' heart.

23
00:02:50.24 --> 00:02:58.56
Rain in the face kept his word by literally tearing out the heart of young Tom Custer.

24
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.40
Near these three brothers and their boyish nephew, lay their brother-in-law, Lt. Calhoun,

25
00:03:06.40 --> 00:03:12.64
who had fallen on the skirmish line. Custer's command was completely annihilated,

26
00:03:12.64 --> 00:03:23.04
not one of his men escaping. Good evening, Echo. Good evening.

27
00:03:24.32 --> 00:03:32.000
Not right there is an excerpt from a book called I Thought with Custer,

28
00:03:33.60 --> 00:03:39.84
which is the story of Charles Windolph, who is a young private that fought with one of the other

29
00:03:39.84 --> 00:03:47.52
companies in the same seventh cavalry regiment that General George Custer led.

30
00:03:49.84 --> 00:03:56.24
General George Custer, who was killed at the Battle of Little Big Horn, where he fought the

31
00:03:56.24 --> 00:04:05.20
Native Americans, including our friend Woodenleg, who we heard from on podcasts 45.

32
00:04:05.20 --> 00:04:11.44
But the opening section that I just read wasn't actually written by private Windolph.

33
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.32
It is a section of an account that is written by a guy named Major Reno, who was one of the leaders

34
00:04:18.32 --> 00:04:24.56
of one of the other companies of men at the Battle that they include in this book.

35
00:04:25.36 --> 00:04:31.76
This book called I Thought with Custer, and this was obviously a brutal battle.

36
00:04:31.76 --> 00:04:39.68
And my goal as always, I shouldn't say, is always, but my goal,

37
00:04:41.60 --> 00:04:51.20
or where I like to focus, is not so much on what details happen in the battle, but what details

38
00:04:51.20 --> 00:04:58.96
happened with the human nature in the battle, the people, the leadership, the decisions.

39
00:04:58.96 --> 00:05:05.76
And we got some good understanding about the Native American perspective from Woodenleg.

40
00:05:07.44 --> 00:05:12.88
But now let's hear a little bit of what it was like for the troopers.

41
00:05:15.04 --> 00:05:20.56
And I know I use that term on a fairly regular basis, but that is a very specific term

42
00:05:20.56 --> 00:05:31.92
in a cavalry unit. And at this time a cavalry unit was literally units that they ride horses.

43
00:05:32.80 --> 00:05:38.32
That's what it is mounted cavalry, a soldier in a cavalry unit is specifically called a trooper.

44
00:05:39.04 --> 00:05:45.36
And the word nowadays, it actually is used to cover a lot of different people.

45
00:05:45.36 --> 00:05:49.60
You know, armored units use it airborne units. You know, you think of an airborne unit,

46
00:05:49.60 --> 00:05:54.000
parachuters, you think of a paratrooper, trooper being the key word.

47
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.48
Obviously there's police, state troopers, and then obviously there's people that listen this podcast.

48
00:06:02.56 --> 00:06:10.64
But that is what we have here, the cavalry unit. And this, in particular, was the seventh cavalry regiment.

49
00:06:10.64 --> 00:06:19.36
And the trooper, like I said, is this guy private Charles Windolph, who was actually born in Germany.

50
00:06:19.92 --> 00:06:23.44
And emigrated to the United States, he became a cobbler.

51
00:06:24.64 --> 00:06:30.24
Like his dad, you know, the cobbler is people who fix shoes, people who fix shoes.

52
00:06:30.24 --> 00:06:34.72
And you know what, he fix shoes for a while, but he didn't like fixing shoes. So what did you do?

53
00:06:34.72 --> 00:06:42.08
Join the army. And he ended up fighting in some of the Indian wars.

54
00:06:43.36 --> 00:06:48.16
He actually received the Medal of Honor for his actions at Little Big Horn and

55
00:06:49.52 --> 00:06:57.36
we'll get into those. But let's hear what private Windolph has to say.

56
00:06:57.36 --> 00:07:09.84
I'm going to the book. June 25th, 1946 was the last time I saw him alive.

57
00:07:11.20 --> 00:07:17.68
Two days later, I looked down on him lying in the white in the Montana sun. That would have been

58
00:07:17.68 --> 00:07:26.32
June 27th, 1876. And the following day, I helped him. I helped Barry him and his brother,

59
00:07:26.32 --> 00:07:33.20
Captain Tom Custer. They were putting graves alongside one another. It was hard digging there

60
00:07:33.20 --> 00:07:38.80
on that high ridge that bordered Little Big Horn. It's a long time to remember

61
00:07:39.68 --> 00:07:46.16
details and little things. But when you've been thinking back on them all those years, they don't

62
00:07:46.16 --> 00:07:52.96
fade away as easily as you might think. They're like birds. They stick in your mind.

63
00:07:52.96 --> 00:08:03.44
People call it the Custer Massacre. It wasn't any massacre. It was a straight hard fight and

64
00:08:03.44 --> 00:08:08.96
the five troops who were with Custer simply got cut to ribbons and every last white man destroyed.

65
00:08:10.16 --> 00:08:15.36
I say every last white man because there were one or two crow scouts who claimed they saw the

66
00:08:15.36 --> 00:08:21.28
start of the fight and then skiddattled. A Crow Indian named Curly said he escaped from the battle

67
00:08:21.28 --> 00:08:27.36
field by putting a blanket over his head and pretending he was a wounded suit. I don't know whether

68
00:08:27.36 --> 00:08:32.64
there's any truth in that or not. I never quite believed it. There's been all kinds of stories

69
00:08:32.64 --> 00:08:38.40
about that battle. Even the men who were with Benteen and Reno and lived to tell the tale

70
00:08:38.40 --> 00:08:42.96
didn't come anywhere near telling the same stories about what they did and what they saw.

71
00:08:44.40 --> 00:08:48.32
Some of them wanted to make heroes out of themselves or of their officers.

72
00:08:48.32 --> 00:08:54.88
I only had one pair of eyes. So of course all I can tell is what I saw myself.

73
00:08:56.08 --> 00:09:00.16
If it is something that I only heard, I'll be sure to mark it down as that.

74
00:09:04.88 --> 00:09:09.84
Interestingly, this is something that we used to see all the time in that you go out of an operation

75
00:09:09.84 --> 00:09:15.60
and when things happen, two guys almost nobody will see the same thing.

76
00:09:15.60 --> 00:09:21.44
Everybody sees some things a little bit different and it's difficult to figure out what's actually

77
00:09:21.44 --> 00:09:27.92
accurate. So that's and he's he's going back when he's writing this book. I think it's been

78
00:09:27.92 --> 00:09:33.28
70 years. So when he's being interviewed and he's writing this book, it's been 70 years. And he's

79
00:09:33.28 --> 00:09:40.40
saying he still remembers the details, but 70 years is a long time, long time. And the characters

80
00:09:40.40 --> 00:09:47.12
that he just brought up Benteen is a guy that he worked for and Reno was one of the other majors.

81
00:09:47.12 --> 00:09:50.24
And another word that they use here is Troop. Now this is a word that's

82
00:09:51.04 --> 00:09:54.88
we think of it as an individual. Hey, there's a trooper over there. There's a troop.

83
00:09:54.88 --> 00:10:01.52
It actually, it actually is another term that means basically like a company of guys. Now

84
00:10:01.52 --> 00:10:05.36
you can see it's small and this is more like a platoon. What they're talking about would be considered

85
00:10:05.36 --> 00:10:13.12
a platoon. I would say from Reedan he had five troops with him, custard did that got killed.

86
00:10:13.12 --> 00:10:21.28
You know, about 200 guys. And so we're not talking about a massive group of people in each troop.

87
00:10:21.28 --> 00:10:24.80
But that's what they're talking about. 20 guys per trooper. Actually, what did that be?

88
00:10:24.80 --> 00:10:29.36
40 guys per troop for five. And so that's what they're talking about. And they refer to the

89
00:10:29.36 --> 00:10:33.84
troops. And even they use the word interchangeably and sometimes they refer to as companies and

90
00:10:33.84 --> 00:10:41.36
sometimes they say troops. Yeah. So you'll go and back to the book here when he's

91
00:10:42.40 --> 00:10:47.20
initially in the army and what they're doing and he talks about what they were doing

92
00:10:48.64 --> 00:10:53.84
at this time. It was pretty dull soldering down there in the south. The regiment was broken up into

93
00:10:53.84 --> 00:11:00.56
companies or small battalions and our job was to smash the Ku Klux Klant and run down a

94
00:11:00.56 --> 00:11:05.44
illicit whiskey distillers. It wasn't much fun for energetic spirited young men.

95
00:11:08.80 --> 00:11:13.36
And he now he's going to talk a little bit about the seventh cavalry. As I say, the seventh

96
00:11:13.36 --> 00:11:19.76
cavalry was only seven years old in 1873, but it had a fine reputation. Everybody in the country,

97
00:11:19.76 --> 00:11:26.48
new general custer. And he was always bragging about what a fine fighting regiment he had.

98
00:11:26.48 --> 00:11:32.000
He was supposed to be the best Indian fighter in the American army. In the civil war,

99
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
they'd called them the boy general. And he'd been a dashing popular figure.

100
00:11:38.56 --> 00:11:42.88
The regiment had spent its first four years of its life on the Kansas Plains and an

101
00:11:42.88 --> 00:11:50.40
Indian Territory. The old timers in the outfit could sure tell some blood curling Indian stories.

102
00:11:51.52 --> 00:11:56.32
They used to say that it was worse than straight death to get captured by the Indians

103
00:11:56.32 --> 00:12:03.20
because you would be slowly tortured until you gave up the ghost. They told all of us young soldiers

104
00:12:03.20 --> 00:12:08.64
if we were ever wounded in an Indian fight and left behind and in danger of being captured

105
00:12:08.64 --> 00:12:16.88
that we must save our last cartridge to blow out our brains. So that's an interesting point when we

106
00:12:16.88 --> 00:12:23.68
remember wooden legs said that all the guys in custer's group ended up killing themselves. And

107
00:12:23.68 --> 00:12:29.92
maybe that's all, you know, that very well might have happened. Or at least some of them.

108
00:12:34.08 --> 00:12:39.76
Back to the book by the spring of 1873, the Plains Indians had been largely debased.

109
00:12:39.76 --> 00:12:43.84
Beaton and driven to the great reservations that had been allotted to the various tribes.

110
00:12:43.84 --> 00:12:49.84
It had not been a deliberate government policy, but it had been cruelly effective one.

111
00:12:49.84 --> 00:12:56.72
Treaty after treaty had been broken by the relentless pressure of white men and their civilization.

112
00:12:56.72 --> 00:13:00.72
Constantly pushing against the ineffective resistance of the red men.

113
00:13:01.92 --> 00:13:08.48
Now, when again, the Indians had struck back and as a rule, their angry flareups were put down

114
00:13:08.48 --> 00:13:15.28
by the army and then new and drastic treaties would be made and more land taken from them in punishment.

115
00:13:15.28 --> 00:13:21.76
But the ink would hardly be dry on these new government commitments before the white pressure would

116
00:13:21.76 --> 00:13:27.76
be resumed. Intrusions made. And once again, the bewildered and raged Indians would strike back

117
00:13:27.76 --> 00:13:34.40
only to be subdued by the army and harsh penalties imposed on them. It was a deadly and vicious

118
00:13:34.40 --> 00:13:45.20
cycle. The Indian found himself whirling endlessly in. So that's reminds me of a lot of

119
00:13:45.20 --> 00:13:53.76
conflicts where you have these things happen. The white man is putting pressure on the Indians.

120
00:13:54.32 --> 00:13:58.000
The Indians don't know what's going on. So they lash out a little bit. What are the white

121
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.64
man do then? Go in there. Smash them. Take more land from them. Compress them more.

122
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.92
Eventually, there's another lash out and you just get this vicious cycle.

123
00:14:07.92 --> 00:14:21.52
In 1864, a certain Colonel Shivington with a regiment of volunteer Colorado cavalry had suddenly

124
00:14:21.52 --> 00:14:27.20
moved against a large encampment of shions and indiscriminately killed some 300 Indians.

125
00:14:28.48 --> 00:14:35.92
The massacre unquestionably had turned many lukewarm Indians into out and out hostiles.

126
00:14:35.92 --> 00:14:41.52
This bitterness of the shions was inflamed two or three years later when

127
00:14:41.52 --> 00:14:48.40
Custer led his newly formed seventh cavalry against black kettle and his band. In a sudden attack

128
00:14:48.40 --> 00:14:56.24
against their sleeping village on the Washtida in Texas. The shions who were recognized as the most

129
00:14:56.24 --> 00:15:02.24
brilliant Indian fighters of the plains never forgave either Custer or his seventh cavalry

130
00:15:02.24 --> 00:15:07.20
for this whirling attack on their sleeping village in the dead of winter.

131
00:15:11.92 --> 00:15:20.96
Another big, yeah, so atrocities on both sides clearly, I'll talk a little bit about those as

132
00:15:20.96 --> 00:15:27.12
well, but one of the biggest atrocities beyond the killing of the Indians themselves, the Native

133
00:15:27.12 --> 00:15:30.96
Americans themselves and those type of atrocities was what they did with the buffaloes.

134
00:15:30.96 --> 00:15:35.12
Because the white man was coming and killing all the buffaloes.

135
00:15:36.56 --> 00:15:42.08
And I'll go to the book here. Once the buffalo around who's existance the whole economy of

136
00:15:42.08 --> 00:15:48.56
the Indian was based was killed off. The nomads had nothing to do but submit to government control

137
00:15:48.56 --> 00:15:54.08
and become agency Indians. Degraded, whiskey crazed and beaten.

138
00:15:55.36 --> 00:16:00.40
Only the various tribes of the Sue and the fighting shions refused to be broken on the

139
00:16:00.40 --> 00:16:06.88
wheel of civilization. A few determined leaders such as sitting bull, crazy horse,

140
00:16:06.88 --> 00:16:14.000
gall, American horse, two moon, white bull, spotted eagle and chief hunk, stubbornly held out

141
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.92
against the threats and blandishments of the whites. But by the spring of 1873,

142
00:16:20.64 --> 00:16:27.44
they were beginning to be branded as hostile. So that's something that I didn't focus on enough

143
00:16:27.44 --> 00:16:33.20
when I talked about how the Sue and the Cheyenne kind of faded. Well, one of the main reasons

144
00:16:33.20 --> 00:16:39.60
that they faded was, you know, again, they gave up their guns at a certain point. But we the white man

145
00:16:40.40 --> 00:16:45.60
had decimated the buffaloes. And so that was their main way of survival. If you remember from

146
00:16:45.60 --> 00:16:49.68
wooden leg, that's where they lived. They lived in shelters that were made from buffalo skins.

147
00:16:49.68 --> 00:16:54.72
And obviously they ate buffalo all the time. They hunted buffalo. They ate them. They made their

148
00:16:54.72 --> 00:17:00.08
weapons out of buffalo. Everything that they did was with buffalo. And so when the white man

149
00:17:00.08 --> 00:17:04.56
came in and killed all the buffalo, that put them in a real precarious situation.

150
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.64
Now we go back to the book talking a little bit about what it was like being the cavalry at this

151
00:17:12.64 --> 00:17:19.60
time. Each man would look after his own horse and we'd usually give him a little exercise and a good

152
00:17:19.60 --> 00:17:25.60
rubbed down. A trooper thought a lot of his mount. And a cavalry man would have to be a pre-mean.

153
00:17:26.24 --> 00:17:30.72
It would have to be pretty mean who didn't take good care of his horse. If we got a good chance,

154
00:17:30.72 --> 00:17:37.04
we'd steal him a little extra oats or hay for individual mounts. My horse at this time was named

155
00:17:37.04 --> 00:17:43.12
pig. That wasn't his real name. But I called him that because nothing could keep him from rolling

156
00:17:43.12 --> 00:17:49.12
in a mud hole when he was being watered. After we'd come in from a long ride, he was fast and he

157
00:17:49.12 --> 00:17:53.92
could show his heels to most of the horses in the regiment. I fought a lot of them, but the army

158
00:17:53.92 --> 00:17:59.76
condemned him after we'd been beaten in the Dakota country a year or two. After we'd been in the

159
00:17:59.76 --> 00:18:05.36
Dakota country a year or two. I'll tell you later about the horse I rode in the battle of little

160
00:18:05.36 --> 00:18:12.24
big horn. But one one thing about pig. Two or three years after the army sold him, I saw him

161
00:18:12.24 --> 00:18:18.96
in a contractor's six horse team in the black hills. He looked so poor and abused. I'd have bought

162
00:18:18.96 --> 00:18:24.32
him from that contractor on the spot, but I didn't have the money. I went up to him and headed him.

163
00:18:25.04 --> 00:18:30.40
He knew me all right. He knickered and looked at me as much to say, come on, please Charlie,

164
00:18:30.40 --> 00:18:36.80
get me out of here. I had ridden old pig thousands of miles and more than once he had saved my life.

165
00:18:36.80 --> 00:18:41.12
I'd pretty near cried when I saw him that time in the black hills.

166
00:18:45.76 --> 00:18:49.36
Big connection. You know, we see that nowadays with the guys that work with dogs,

167
00:18:50.16 --> 00:18:56.48
and the military working dogs, which are awesome animals and those guys get major,

168
00:18:56.48 --> 00:19:02.08
majorly connected to those dogs. She's like horse, where it's just, there's a lot of them's

169
00:19:02.08 --> 00:19:07.60
worth just unimbed in the world. It's just you and him. It's like, dang, you go through so much together,

170
00:19:07.60 --> 00:19:12.48
upstones. And then, for sure, I can't even imagine the emotion of that situation.

171
00:19:15.52 --> 00:19:22.48
Back to the book, it was at the yankton that I first saw general custer. He was not far from six feet

172
00:19:22.48 --> 00:19:27.84
tall. He must have weighed around 180 pounds. He was energetic and it was mighty hard to wear

173
00:19:27.84 --> 00:19:33.84
him out. I've heard people say that when he was at West Point, he was the second strongest man there.

174
00:19:35.20 --> 00:19:39.68
As I remember him at the time, he was wearing long hair, something like Buffalo Bill used to wear.

175
00:19:40.40 --> 00:19:47.52
Yet a big wide-bring western hat and long military mustache. His hair and mustache were yellow,

176
00:19:47.52 --> 00:19:54.80
tony colored. I suppose would be the right way to describe them. He had on high-wellington boots.

177
00:19:54.80 --> 00:20:00.000
They were the kind that came up to the knees with the front three or four inches higher than the back.

178
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.40
They were popular among officers at the time. General custer wasn't the kind to mix freely with

179
00:20:06.40 --> 00:20:13.04
the men. In those years there, was quite a gulf between the officers and the enlisted men.

180
00:20:13.04 --> 00:20:17.84
Some of the officers were friendly and easy going with their troopers, but there was always a gulf.

181
00:20:17.84 --> 00:20:30.32
Custer struck me as being aloof and removed. Noted. It got to be gossip among the troopers

182
00:20:30.32 --> 00:20:37.84
that some of the officers didn't set so very well with the general. My captain, Colonel Benteen.

183
00:20:37.84 --> 00:20:42.000
So there's something interesting I want to point this out. Some of these including general

184
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.000
custer, these guys have been promoted during the civil war. So general custer had become a general

185
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.28
during the civil war, but after the war they got demoted. They got put back down and rank because

186
00:20:53.28 --> 00:21:00.40
they shrank the armies. They shrank the army. And so for instance general custer at this time was

187
00:21:00.40 --> 00:21:04.16
he had been a general in the civil war. Now all of a sudden he's a Colonel. So he got put down and

188
00:21:04.16 --> 00:21:15.12
rank and it's the same with he's talking about his boss. Windoffs boss. Windoffs boss was a guy named

189
00:21:15.12 --> 00:21:18.64
Captain Benteen, but they called him Colonel Benteen because he was a Colonel during civil war.

190
00:21:20.08 --> 00:21:24.16
My captain Colonel Benteen was one of those folks who didn't belong to the generals in

191
00:21:24.16 --> 00:21:29.04
or circle. I suppose you could say about half the officers in the regiment were close to

192
00:21:29.04 --> 00:21:35.36
custer and the rest were not. I repeat that Benteen was not distinct was distinctly not an

193
00:21:35.36 --> 00:21:41.28
intimate of custer. I heard all sorts of reasons why that was true. There was one report that Benteen

194
00:21:41.28 --> 00:21:47.20
had turned bitter because custer had pulled out after the battle of the Washeeda in December 1868

195
00:21:47.20 --> 00:21:54.88
in Kansas and it left a major Elliott and 17 men to their fate. A day or two later they were all

196
00:21:54.88 --> 00:22:02.24
found killed, scout, and mutilated. There was a story that custer and Benteen had some hard words

197
00:22:02.24 --> 00:22:12.08
over that, but of course I don't know how true that old story is. So there you go. Benteen thought

198
00:22:12.08 --> 00:22:18.64
custer let some guys hang out to dry, had to confront it and custer didn't like that at all.

199
00:22:18.64 --> 00:22:26.08
And now they got some stuff that they're at odds about. And speaking of that event where

200
00:22:27.04 --> 00:22:36.24
these 17 men were were killed in this book, they have an excerpt that's a letter from an army officer

201
00:22:36.24 --> 00:22:42.08
that got published in a newspaper about that event. And I'm going to read it.

202
00:22:42.08 --> 00:22:49.92
The bodies were found in a small circle stripped as naked as windborne and frozen stiff.

203
00:22:50.88 --> 00:22:55.04
Their heads had been battered in and some of them had been entirely chopped off.

204
00:22:56.08 --> 00:23:01.52
Some of them had the Adam's apple cut out of their fruits. Some had their hands and feet caught

205
00:23:01.52 --> 00:23:07.76
off and nearly all had been horribly mangled in a way delicacy forbids me to mention.

206
00:23:07.76 --> 00:23:12.08
They lay scarcely two miles from the scene of the fight.

207
00:23:14.16 --> 00:23:21.60
Who can describe the feeling of that brave band as with anxious hearts beating? They

208
00:23:21.60 --> 00:23:25.84
strained their yearning eyes in the direction whence they help should come.

209
00:23:26.72 --> 00:23:31.36
What must have been the despair that when all hopes of soccer died out,

210
00:23:31.36 --> 00:23:41.60
nerve their stout arms to do and die? Round and round rush the red themes, smaller and smaller

211
00:23:41.60 --> 00:23:48.40
shrinks the circle, but the aim of that devoted gallant knot of heroes is steady or than ever

212
00:23:48.40 --> 00:23:52.08
and the death howl of the murderous red skin is more frequent.

213
00:23:53.76 --> 00:24:00.80
But on they come and masses grim with glittering lans and one long loud exulting

214
00:24:00.80 --> 00:24:06.64
whoop as if the gates of hell had opened and loosed the whole infernal host.

215
00:24:08.40 --> 00:24:13.52
A well-directed volley from their trusty carbines makes some of the miscreants real and fall,

216
00:24:13.52 --> 00:24:16.56
but their death rattles are drowned in the greater din.

217
00:24:18.24 --> 00:24:25.04
Soon every voice in that little band is still as death, but the hellish work of the

218
00:24:25.04 --> 00:24:34.24
savages is scarce begun and their ingenuys are taxed to invent barbarities to practice on the bodies

219
00:24:34.24 --> 00:24:35.76
of the fallen brave.

220
00:24:41.84 --> 00:24:48.56
Some psychological warfare going on there. Clearly we know that the troopers at this time

221
00:24:48.56 --> 00:24:55.60
think you don't want to get captured by the Indians and the reason that they think that is events

222
00:24:55.60 --> 00:25:00.32
like this, mutilated bodies, everyone killed no quarter given.

223
00:25:03.28 --> 00:25:09.20
Now going to what some of the other officers we're like I'm going to talk about Captain Benteen.

224
00:25:10.16 --> 00:25:14.64
Here's what Captain Benteen was like back to the book. Most of the time we were in the field,

225
00:25:14.64 --> 00:25:19.76
Captain Benteen commanded a squadron. Usually you'd have one or two companies besides his own

226
00:25:19.76 --> 00:25:26.40
age company. He was a wonderful officer. He let the first sergeant pretty much run the company.

227
00:25:28.24 --> 00:25:33.44
Little decentralized command going on. He wasn't always interfering and running the details.

228
00:25:34.08 --> 00:25:38.88
So he wasn't getting in the way. He wasn't a micro manager. I served under Benteen for 12

229
00:25:38.88 --> 00:25:45.68
full years, lacking only those three days. One of the best descriptions of Captain Benteen is that

230
00:25:45.68 --> 00:25:53.68
penned by the late major general Hugh L. Scott on page 454 of his interesting book,

231
00:25:53.68 --> 00:26:01.36
some memoirs of the soldier. I found my model early in Captain Benteen, the idol of the

232
00:26:01.36 --> 00:26:10.24
seventh cavalry on the upper Missouri in 1877, who governed mainly by suggestion. In all the years,

233
00:26:10.24 --> 00:26:16.96
I knew him. I never once heard him raise his voice to enforce his purpose. Think about that.

234
00:26:17.76 --> 00:26:25.28
Never once heard him raise his voice to enforce his purpose. He would sit by the open fire at night.

235
00:26:25.28 --> 00:26:30.08
His bright pleasant face framed by his snow white hair, beaming with kindness and humor,

236
00:26:30.08 --> 00:26:35.60
and often watched, often I watched his every movement to find out the secret of his quiet,

237
00:26:35.60 --> 00:26:44.08
steady government that I might go and govern likewise. For example, if he intended to stay a few

238
00:26:44.08 --> 00:26:51.28
days in one camp, he would say to his agitant, Brewer, don't you think we had better take up

239
00:26:51.28 --> 00:26:58.64
our regular guard, Mount Wallen camp, and Brewer always thought it better and so did everyone else.

240
00:26:58.64 --> 00:27:06.16
If he found this kindly manner was misunderstood, then his iron hand would close quickly down,

241
00:27:06.16 --> 00:27:13.92
but that was seldom necessary. And then only with newcomers and never twice with the same person.

242
00:27:15.20 --> 00:27:20.08
So this is just complete example of indirect leadership. Hey, don't you?

243
00:27:20.08 --> 00:27:23.68
Hey, Echo, do you think you'd be good if we're going to stay in this camp? We should put our camp guards out.

244
00:27:23.68 --> 00:27:29.44
What do you think? Of course. There you go. So you make it happen. I didn't give you an order.

245
00:27:29.44 --> 00:27:33.44
I actually let you get some ownership of it. It's actually now your decision is not even my decision anymore.

246
00:27:36.40 --> 00:27:39.68
That's a really good example of some solid leadership.

247
00:27:42.56 --> 00:27:46.56
Here's what it was like to be in the camp for me. It was wonderful to be young and to be

248
00:27:46.56 --> 00:27:54.64
riding into Indian country as part of the finest regiment of cavalry in the world. We were mighty proud

249
00:27:54.64 --> 00:27:59.12
of the seventh. It just didn't seem like anything could ever happen to it.

250
00:28:04.64 --> 00:28:10.72
Now I'm going to go through, they're riding out, they're working the planes. And I'm going to go through

251
00:28:11.28 --> 00:28:13.20
a little battle on the planes where

252
00:28:13.20 --> 00:28:20.80
clusters and charge general, George Custer's in charge. The general started, so did the Indians.

253
00:28:20.80 --> 00:28:25.28
They had a good start in general, Custer resolved not to pursue them too far away from his men.

254
00:28:26.08 --> 00:28:31.84
After a sharp, short race, he stopped on the plane, keeping well away from the suspicious woods.

255
00:28:33.44 --> 00:28:40.08
When he stopped, the Indians stopped. He was evident that they would not be so audacious without

256
00:28:40.08 --> 00:28:48.40
a consciousness of strength somewhere. For ways that are dark and tricks that are vain,

257
00:28:48.40 --> 00:28:55.92
the heathensu is almost as peculiar as the heathen Chinese.

258
00:28:56.96 --> 00:29:00.72
And I actually had to go and do a little research on that one. There's a poem

259
00:29:02.08 --> 00:29:07.28
that's it's about Chinese migrant workers. That interests you can go and read about this poem.

260
00:29:07.28 --> 00:29:13.04
It's called the Heathen Chinese. And if you read the poem, you realize that

261
00:29:14.88 --> 00:29:20.40
he's trying to describe that they're playing cards with a couple of the people working on a

262
00:29:20.40 --> 00:29:25.52
train or playing cards of the Chinese guy. And as they're playing cards,

263
00:29:27.60 --> 00:29:32.40
they're kind of treating the Chinese guy like he's ignorant, but he's actually winning.

264
00:29:32.96 --> 00:29:37.12
And when they accused him of cheating, there's a fight and it was actually the white guy that was cheating.

265
00:29:37.12 --> 00:29:41.52
One of the other white guys that was cheating. So the guy that wrote the poem had written the poem

266
00:29:41.52 --> 00:29:47.76
with the intention of showing hey, these people are smart and they're trustworthy. But because of the

267
00:29:47.76 --> 00:29:54.08
name, it got red and misinterpreted a lot. The title of the poem, the Hiven Chinese, you know,

268
00:29:54.08 --> 00:30:01.52
that's not a very positive name. At least that's kind of, I did some very quick research on that.

269
00:30:01.52 --> 00:30:05.84
Just to figure out what it's all about. And that's sort of what I gathered after a quick, uh,

270
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.84
quick research. Meaning I googled it and read a few articles. Figure out what's going on.

271
00:30:13.84 --> 00:30:18.32
Hawaiian pigeon. We say Japanese. We say Japanese. We say Japanese.

272
00:30:19.92 --> 00:30:27.12
Portuguese is putagee. Chinese. Chinese. Maybe some maybe some relationship.

273
00:30:27.12 --> 00:30:35.04
Anxion. There. All right, back to the book. This time, the trick was indeed vain. They were fighting

274
00:30:35.04 --> 00:30:40.56
with no novice. As soon as general custer saw the Indian Dodge, which was to use these men as a

275
00:30:40.56 --> 00:30:45.52
decoy to draw them into the woods, he immediately sent his orderly back to Captain Moilin to order a

276
00:30:45.52 --> 00:30:52.48
platoon to dismount. Before the order could get back 250 mounted Indians drawn up in a line of battle

277
00:30:52.48 --> 00:30:57.36
came out of the woods and fine military style. The seventh cavalry could hardly have done it

278
00:30:57.36 --> 00:31:04.32
better with painted faces, heads decorated with ribbons. They sallied out with loud war wolves.

279
00:31:05.68 --> 00:31:09.84
General custer putting more confidence in the feet of his thoroughbred than the voice of his

280
00:31:09.84 --> 00:31:14.88
rifle against 250 Indians turned back to his command calling out to his brother to throw out a

281
00:31:14.88 --> 00:31:22.24
dismounted line. Lieutenant custer had anticipated the order and was already dismounting his men.

282
00:31:22.24 --> 00:31:26.64
That s awesome. So these guys work together. He goes to give the order. His brothers are already on it.

283
00:31:28.40 --> 00:31:32.32
They ran forward and took places in the grass. The Indians opened a heavy fire, which was

284
00:31:32.32 --> 00:31:38.64
quickly answered by our men with their sharp carbines. In a dismounted cavalry fight,

285
00:31:38.96 --> 00:31:45.36
every fourth man is usually detailed to hold the horses. But being short of fighting men and the

286
00:31:45.36 --> 00:31:49.84
reserves being several miles back with the train, general custer ordered every six men

287
00:31:49.84 --> 00:31:55.60
only to hold the horses and the rest to join the skirmish line. The Indians having three times

288
00:31:55.60 --> 00:32:00.40
as large a force and seeing the cavalry dismounted followed their example and dismounted.

289
00:32:00.96 --> 00:32:06.40
From their advantage of numbers, they were able to extend the skirmish line clear around from

290
00:32:06.40 --> 00:32:13.04
river to river so as to enclose the cavalry in a semi circle with the woods and the river at

291
00:32:13.04 --> 00:32:20.40
their back. They get inflanked. Finding that the horses were exposed to fire, general custer ordered

292
00:32:20.40 --> 00:32:29.44
them to be led further into the timber. Now, some other things take place and I'm kind of

293
00:32:29.44 --> 00:32:33.92
fast forward a little bit through the story. The Indians having lost two men were more cautious in

294
00:32:33.92 --> 00:32:38.56
their advance and finding that they could not with their heavy rifles drive the cavalry into the

295
00:32:38.56 --> 00:32:45.20
woods had recourse to another favorite weapon. They fired the grass in four or five places,

296
00:32:45.20 --> 00:32:51.04
meaning they set the grass on fire. So you imagine you're hiding the grass and then also

297
00:32:51.04 --> 00:32:56.88
they're setting the grass on fire. Fortunately, there was little or no wind and the grass was too

298
00:32:56.88 --> 00:33:03.20
short and too green to burn well. Else this new weapon might have proved formidable indeed.

299
00:33:03.20 --> 00:33:09.60
The fire, however, raised a blue curtain of smoke forming a corner segment between the fighting

300
00:33:09.60 --> 00:33:16.16
arcs. Failing in their attempt to raise a great fire, the red skins used this smoke line as a

301
00:33:16.16 --> 00:33:23.60
mask for their rifles. Advancing under cover of this curtain, they would pour a volley at our line

302
00:33:23.60 --> 00:33:29.12
and retreat a little bit of cover move happening. Our men soon discovered the dodge and laid

303
00:33:29.12 --> 00:33:34.88
equal claim to the curtain. The Indians abandoning this position began to draw in their men.

304
00:33:35.60 --> 00:33:41.92
Now, General Custer said to Captain Moillan, let us mount and drive them off. The men immediately

305
00:33:41.92 --> 00:33:48.000
mounted an advanced as skirmishers on a truck. Finding this was not fast enough, a charge was ordered.

306
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.92
The men eager for the order gave a loud yell and put their horses into a full gallop.

307
00:33:53.92 --> 00:34:00.40
Nearly 300 to number, the sight of 80 cavalry men coming toward them like mad caps was too much

308
00:34:00.40 --> 00:34:04.56
for the Indians. They turned like sheep and scattered in every direction.

309
00:34:09.12 --> 00:34:13.84
Battles. Battles on the planes. Small unit tactics.

310
00:34:16.16 --> 00:34:19.36
Very similar to the small unit tactics that are used today.

311
00:34:19.36 --> 00:34:25.52
We smoke in Ramadi. We smoke in Ramadi. We smoke in the smoke. What are you using those for?

312
00:34:25.52 --> 00:34:28.16
Set up a little curtain so people can't see you when you're moving.

313
00:34:32.64 --> 00:34:35.28
And you'll notice also there was some aggressive action.

314
00:34:36.16 --> 00:34:40.40
It's that aggressive action. Both sides when they got aggressive, they started doing better.

315
00:34:40.40 --> 00:34:44.72
When you start getting when the other when your opponent becomes the aggressor,

316
00:34:44.72 --> 00:34:50.32
you start getting put on your heels. It's a good state aggressive. De-falte mode.

317
00:34:53.12 --> 00:34:58.08
Now talking a little bit about what it was like when they were back in camp.

318
00:34:58.08 --> 00:35:00.88
So they weren't on the road all the time. They weren't out in the planes all the time. Sometimes they

319
00:35:00.88 --> 00:35:06.000
would be back in camp. They had their bad bands. They had some of them had their wives there.

320
00:35:07.12 --> 00:35:13.84
They had good food. And you know, basically good stuff going on.

321
00:35:13.84 --> 00:35:18.16
They had pretty relaxed time. But it was always, let's prepare. We're going back out in the field.

322
00:35:18.16 --> 00:35:23.28
So they're back out in the field here. General Custer, who has used was writing a head with a

323
00:35:23.28 --> 00:35:29.36
couple of troops came upon smoldering campfires that showed that three Indian TPs had recently been

324
00:35:29.36 --> 00:35:34.16
there. He sent bloody knife ahead with several Indians. So that bloody knife you're going to

325
00:35:34.16 --> 00:35:40.000
hear is voiced throughout here. Bloody knife was Custer's right handman. He was a Indian scout.

326
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.000
So they galloped back with the information that they had located the Indians.

327
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.60
Custer surrounded the little camp and brought back four bucks with him to our camp.

328
00:35:51.60 --> 00:35:57.68
The head was a minor chief named Onestab, who squaw was a daughter of Red Cloud.

329
00:35:57.68 --> 00:36:03.28
Custer promised them food if they helped them. But they seemed to be in a hurry to leave.

330
00:36:03.28 --> 00:36:08.08
And before they could be checked, they mounted their ponies and were off. Custer sent troopers

331
00:36:08.08 --> 00:36:14.56
after them. But the only one they could catch and bring back was Onestab. He was told he would be

332
00:36:14.56 --> 00:36:22.08
given all the bacon, sugar, and coffee that two ponies could carry if he'd act as a guide. He agreed.

333
00:36:27.20 --> 00:36:32.72
So again, I guess the reason I wanted to bring that up is it shows that there was Indians

334
00:36:32.72 --> 00:36:37.36
working on both sides. And there was Indians that went from back and forth between sides,

335
00:36:37.36 --> 00:36:41.92
depending on depending on what the situation is, depending on how they got brimbed.

336
00:36:41.92 --> 00:36:49.84
But we know that there was wars between the Indians. So that's why sometimes the Indians

337
00:36:49.84 --> 00:36:55.04
teamed up with the soldiers, the American troops, and went and got after it with them.

338
00:36:55.04 --> 00:37:01.52
Yeah, is that because they got when you say brimbed, they got kind of enticed with civilization.

339
00:37:01.52 --> 00:37:04.56
Well, no, I'm talking about straight up, brimbed right there. They're talking about Onestab.

340
00:37:04.56 --> 00:37:08.64
They say, hey, Onestab, will you help guide us? Well, I don't know if I feel comfortable about that.

341
00:37:08.64 --> 00:37:12.64
Okay, we'll give you all the bacon, all the sugar, and all the coffee that you can carry on two horses.

342
00:37:12.64 --> 00:37:18.32
He says, all right, cool. My man. Yeah, and if they're worrying, you know, if that's kind of their enemy

343
00:37:18.32 --> 00:37:22.72
and the way you know, and let's do it. Yeah, maybe he was just, maybe he was just getting to get in some

344
00:37:23.60 --> 00:37:29.36
food out of what he would already like to do. Yeah, and what is it that the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

345
00:37:29.36 --> 00:37:35.92
Hmm, there you go. Yeah, now in the black hills, they think that they find gold. They think they

346
00:37:35.92 --> 00:37:41.68
find gold and the black hills, and this is just a good, a good common here about, I guess you could

347
00:37:41.68 --> 00:37:51.12
say it's about material desires. Gold to most men means sudden wealth, big times, whiskey,

348
00:37:51.12 --> 00:37:59.68
and gambling, and women. It means fortune and adventure and all the things they never had. The

349
00:37:59.68 --> 00:38:10.88
gold fever is like taking dope. Your helpless when it strikes you. Careful that material greed.

350
00:38:12.96 --> 00:38:19.44
I once read about how everyone who touched an Egyptian king's tomb was doomed to die of

351
00:38:19.44 --> 00:38:26.56
violent death. Seems to me that the Indians must have put some curse like that on the white man who first

352
00:38:26.56 --> 00:38:32.96
touched their sacred black hills at this time. Custer got a lot of notoriety from his black

353
00:38:32.96 --> 00:38:39.36
hills expedition and the discovery of gold, but he never had any luck after that.

354
00:38:39.36 --> 00:38:54.88
Now, getting just a cursory look at the politics of what happened in the time, and attempt was

355
00:38:54.88 --> 00:39:01.60
made that summer of 75 to buy the black hills from the Indians and make legal this onslaught.

356
00:39:01.60 --> 00:39:06.40
But the Indians were no mood to believe anything the commissioners told them, and it was

357
00:39:06.40 --> 00:39:12.56
impossible to make a deal of any kind, a feeling of utter despair and despondency cast its spell

358
00:39:12.56 --> 00:39:19.36
over even the friendly reservation Indians. Maybe the radical things sitting bull and crazy horse

359
00:39:19.36 --> 00:39:24.32
and gall and two moons and the other wild chiefs far back in the buffalo lands around the

360
00:39:24.32 --> 00:39:30.64
powder and the big horn were preaching, maybe they made sense. The free Indian was doomed.

361
00:39:30.64 --> 00:39:38.16
They were all to be made reservation Indians, that meant all the colorful old life would be gone forever.

362
00:39:38.16 --> 00:39:45.12
The buffalo hunts, the feasts, the sun dances, the visiting, and the pleasant horse stealing

363
00:39:45.12 --> 00:39:52.000
wars. All the old life would be no more. Maybe those radical chiefs were right,

364
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:58.08
maybe they'd all be better to make one big battle against the whites. It would be better to die

365
00:39:58.08 --> 00:40:03.52
a free Indian than live as a degraded, helpless treaty Indian.

366
00:40:04.80 --> 00:40:11.36
So evident was the hostile feeling that in the fall of 1875 that an order was submitted by the

367
00:40:11.36 --> 00:40:18.24
commissioner of Indian Affairs Edward P. Smith to the secretary of the interior, Z Chandler, who

368
00:40:18.24 --> 00:40:22.24
in turn submitted to the secretary of war, General Bell map.

369
00:40:22.24 --> 00:40:28.56
A subsequent communication from the secretary of interior to the secretary of war dated December 1,

370
00:40:28.56 --> 00:40:36.88
1875 read as follows. I have the honor to inform you that I have this day directed the commissioner

371
00:40:36.88 --> 00:40:43.12
of Indian Affairs to notify said Indian sitting bull and the others outside the reservations that

372
00:40:43.12 --> 00:40:53.12
they must return to the reservations before January 31, 1876. And if they neglect or refuse, so to move,

373
00:40:53.76 --> 00:40:59.36
they will be reported to the war department as hostile Indians, and that a military force

374
00:40:59.36 --> 00:41:04.16
will be sent to compel them to obey the order of the Indian department.

375
00:41:04.16 --> 00:41:20.56
And there it is to compel them. Yep, there it is. And how, that's that, that you have to be wary

376
00:41:20.56 --> 00:41:29.92
of your government having so much power and leaving yourself defenseless in these situations.

377
00:41:29.92 --> 00:41:37.12
I think we learn a lot from the Indians, from the native Americans on that.

378
00:41:38.32 --> 00:41:45.44
Back to the book, General Custer was not at for Abraham Lincoln when we arrived there in late April

379
00:41:45.44 --> 00:41:52.96
1876. Of course, that aroused a lot of talk and suspicion. When you jiggle all those rumors down,

380
00:41:52.96 --> 00:41:58.96
you got about this. We were soon to start a big expedition up to Yellowstone to round up the

381
00:41:58.96 --> 00:42:05.44
hostiles and drive them back to the reservations. If they would not go peacefully, we were to make

382
00:42:05.44 --> 00:42:11.60
good Indians out of them. There was a lot of suspicious talk going around all over the place.

383
00:42:11.60 --> 00:42:17.44
Custer was still in the east, so Custer had gone back to the east. And you could hear a hundred

384
00:42:17.44 --> 00:42:23.36
tales of how he was being kept away from the expedition because he had got under the skin of

385
00:42:23.36 --> 00:42:31.20
president Grant. A lot of the troopers didn't much care for Custer. But it looked as if major

386
00:42:31.20 --> 00:42:36.96
Reno would command the regiment if Custer didn't arrive. And most of us didn't know or care a

387
00:42:36.96 --> 00:42:42.56
great deal about Reno. Of course, we knew that he had been a colonel of a Pennsylvania cavalry

388
00:42:42.56 --> 00:42:48.40
regiment at the end of the Civil War, but he had never fought Indians. And he didn't seem to be very

389
00:42:48.40 --> 00:42:54.72
popular with either the men or the officers. If I remember correctly, he was a west pointer and was

390
00:42:54.72 --> 00:43:00.000
three or four years ahead of Custer. It was pretty clear that there wasn't much love lost between

391
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.76
the two men. Politics. Total politics. And some of those people in the Civil War, they don't realize

392
00:43:07.76 --> 00:43:12.08
this stuff happens all the time. It's a politics crazy politics in the military. And just this kind of

393
00:43:12.08 --> 00:43:16.96
stuff right here. Oh, you're seeing you're to me. Oh, you made the other guy mad and now we're

394
00:43:16.96 --> 00:43:20.24
going to get pulled up and I pulled you off this operation. I'm going to let this guy go on the

395
00:43:20.24 --> 00:43:26.72
operation. This is just so typical of the military. Unfortunately. And you know what? It's not just

396
00:43:26.72 --> 00:43:31.84
typical to military. It's typical. In any company, any business, any team, there's always going to be

397
00:43:31.84 --> 00:43:36.48
these political things that are happening. I mean, occasionally you get to a great organization that

398
00:43:36.48 --> 00:43:42.000
really limits that. I shouldn't say it's everywhere, but it's very, very common. And you know,

399
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.84
someone just asked me on Twitter, you know, hey, it's really political. I'm not really good at politics.

400
00:43:48.40 --> 00:43:52.88
You know, which is it something that I should actually try and engage in? I don't know. Yes.

401
00:43:53.92 --> 00:43:57.92
Yes, it's going to you have to. If you're in an organization that's a political organization

402
00:43:57.92 --> 00:44:02.08
and you want to make things happen, you want to implement changes. Yes,

403
00:44:02.72 --> 00:44:07.36
start figuring out how to play those games. Oh, you don't, you're not a political person. Cool

404
00:44:07.36 --> 00:44:11.92
become one. Yeah. Because what you want to do is you want to do a good job. You want to, you want to do

405
00:44:11.92 --> 00:44:17.28
good job. And whatever it is that you're doing. And sometimes that requires that you play those games.

406
00:44:17.28 --> 00:44:23.92
You just don't play the games. Get good at them. Back to the book. Everything was uncertain in those

407
00:44:24.56 --> 00:44:29.28
late April and early May days while the regiment was being whipped into marching shape.

408
00:44:29.92 --> 00:44:34.72
We had a few recruits, a bunch, and a bunch of fresh young horses. So there was plenty to do

409
00:44:34.72 --> 00:44:40.72
to break in both of them. One thing that people get wrong about the recruits was that about half of

410
00:44:40.72 --> 00:44:46.72
the 150 new men we had were men who either had civil war experience or had already served the

411
00:44:46.72 --> 00:44:52.32
five year hitch in the army. Most of the rest were plenty green. A good many of them were German

412
00:44:52.32 --> 00:44:58.64
boys. They made fine soldiers once they were trained. I think it was about May 10th that general

413
00:44:58.64 --> 00:45:04.48
custer suddenly showed up. General Terry was with him. Terry was of slight build and war whiskers.

414
00:45:04.48 --> 00:45:09.84
He was a gentle kindly man who never struttered in a world. Nothing at all like the quick moving

415
00:45:09.84 --> 00:45:16.000
dashing young custer. Terry was a brigadier general of the regular army. And so he ranked

416
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:22.56
custer by two grades. Word ran around camp. The general Terry was to command the whole expedition

417
00:45:22.56 --> 00:45:29.04
but that custer was to have his old regiment. Custer was as happy as a boy with a new red sled.

418
00:45:29.92 --> 00:45:36.16
He put a lot of zip into us. Now custer, this political stuff that he's dealing with,

419
00:45:38.56 --> 00:45:42.88
it's still going on. It's still happening. I'm not going to go through the details of it,

420
00:45:42.88 --> 00:45:51.44
but he who's somehow seen as an agitator or an enemy of President Grant.

421
00:45:51.44 --> 00:45:56.88
And so we actually get ordered off the so he goes back out, takes back over the regiment,

422
00:45:56.88 --> 00:46:01.84
starts whipping people into shape. He's going to work for General Terry. Grant, President Grant,

423
00:46:01.84 --> 00:46:11.44
says no, actually come back. You're not, you don't get to do this. And custer decides he writes a

424
00:46:11.44 --> 00:46:16.16
dispatch to be sent directly to the president of the United States. That's kind of crazy.

425
00:46:16.16 --> 00:46:23.12
We didn't do much communications with the president from my task in the US.

426
00:46:25.52 --> 00:46:29.52
Here we go back to the book. And oh wait, here's, so here's what he actually sent.

427
00:46:29.52 --> 00:46:33.84
It's awesome. That's what's beautiful about history. This is what custer actually sent.

428
00:46:33.84 --> 00:46:39.20
And Grant, Grant, President Grant was a guy that was, you know, went to West Point as well.

429
00:46:39.20 --> 00:46:47.60
He fought in the Mexican-American War. He retired after that, which retired from the army,

430
00:46:47.60 --> 00:46:54.16
but then the civil war started. So he went back in the army as a general and he fought it.

431
00:46:54.16 --> 00:47:04.88
Shiloh and Vixberg and actually generally surrendered to President Grant. So this guy's,

432
00:47:04.88 --> 00:47:08.40
you know, a warrior. And here's what you're going to hear custer kind of appeal to that.

433
00:47:11.84 --> 00:47:17.44
Here we go. I have seen your order transmitted through the General of the army directing that I

434
00:47:17.44 --> 00:47:22.000
not be permitted to accompany the expedition about to move against the hostile Indians.

435
00:47:23.60 --> 00:47:29.12
As my entire regiment forms a part of the proposed expedition. And as I am the senior officer of

436
00:47:29.12 --> 00:47:35.12
the regiment on duty in the department, I respectfully but most earnestly request that I, while

437
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:42.08
not allowed to go and command of the expedition. I may be permitted to serve with my regiment in the field.

438
00:47:43.20 --> 00:47:50.64
I appeal to you as a soldier to spare me the humiliation of seeing my regiment march to meet the

439
00:47:50.64 --> 00:48:01.20
enemy and I not to share its dangers. It was too much for the hero of apomotics.

440
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:08.96
Custer was to have back his beloved regiment. So Grant gives in and says, okay, you can go.

441
00:48:08.96 --> 00:48:16.16
You're not going to be in charge, but you can go. And so they roll out on this expedition.

442
00:48:16.16 --> 00:48:22.88
And here's the description of what that felt like. You felt like you were somebody when you were

443
00:48:23.52 --> 00:48:29.84
on a good horse with a car being dangling from its small leather ring socket on your saddle and a

444
00:48:29.84 --> 00:48:34.56
cold army revolver strapped on your hip and a hundred rounds of ammunition in your webbelt

445
00:48:34.56 --> 00:48:42.32
and your saddle pockets. You were a cavalryman of the seventh regiment. You were part of a proud

446
00:48:42.32 --> 00:48:49.84
outfit that had a fighting reputation and you were ready for a fight or a frolic. So these guys

447
00:48:49.84 --> 00:48:54.08
had some pretty good morale rolling out. They did some hard training when they were in camp and now they're

448
00:48:54.08 --> 00:49:01.68
ready to get after it. It talks a little bit about. Custer he describes Custer.

449
00:49:02.72 --> 00:49:07.68
I can almost see him myself in my mind's eye. He was wearing a broad Western hat with a low

450
00:49:07.68 --> 00:49:15.92
crown and a wide brin. Brim, it was grayish and color. He'd had his long yellow hair cut just before we left.

451
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.32
And he had on a buckskin suit with fringe. He had two short bill barrel bulldog revolvers and a

452
00:49:24.32 --> 00:49:30.24
remington sporting rifle carried in a scabbard. It's my recollection that he carried a hunting knife

453
00:49:30.24 --> 00:49:40.96
in a fringe to buckskin case. That's straight up rock and roll stars of the 70s war

454
00:49:40.96 --> 00:49:49.92
fringe on their outfits. Custer is a character. He's definitely a character. Back to the book,

455
00:49:49.92 --> 00:49:55.68
when the regiment was formed in Kansas in 1866 the general that went, the general went to a lot of

456
00:49:55.68 --> 00:50:02.80
trouble to have each troop mounted on distinct colors. I thought this was awesome so I included it.

457
00:50:02.80 --> 00:50:09.44
He's talking about what color horses they had and each troop had a specific colored horse.

458
00:50:09.44 --> 00:50:20.24
I can still call them off even at this late date. H, my own troop, road blood bays. B, D, I and L also were

459
00:50:20.24 --> 00:50:29.36
mounted on bays. C, G, and K had sorrows. A had coal blacks. And Lieutenant Edgely's

460
00:50:29.36 --> 00:50:38.08
E troop had grays. We used to call E the band box troop. M troop was the only troop that had mixed

461
00:50:38.08 --> 00:50:44.24
colors. The whole band rode white horses. I remember the drummer had a horse that would run away

462
00:50:44.24 --> 00:50:49.60
every time he mounted him except when he put his drum on him. Then that old horse would stand still

463
00:50:49.60 --> 00:50:56.32
as a wooden horse. It was a fine regiment right enough. And it wasn't a man in it who didn't

464
00:50:56.32 --> 00:51:04.48
believe it was the greatest cavalry outfit in the entire United States Army. That actually is

465
00:51:05.60 --> 00:51:10.56
when I hear about these guys talking about the horses we actually had little relationships like that

466
00:51:10.56 --> 00:51:19.20
with our humvies. We'd name them. You know we named our humvies. Yeah we named our humvies. Various

467
00:51:19.20 --> 00:51:25.52
names. We used to have when we used to do a lot more water work before the war started. We

468
00:51:25.52 --> 00:51:33.92
we actually named our outboard motors. They had little my one of my the guy that handled the outboard

469
00:51:33.92 --> 00:51:41.60
motors in my second platoon. He was all into it. And his nickname was Zulu. But Zulu, he was all into

470
00:51:41.60 --> 00:51:47.44
these motors. And he had every motor had a name and he kept these detailed log books on how many

471
00:51:47.44 --> 00:51:51.76
hours and when the maintenance was done all that. And when we came back from one deployment and

472
00:51:51.76 --> 00:51:56.32
we were going to go do another deployment. We came back. They said hey you know you guys guess what?

473
00:51:56.32 --> 00:52:01.76
Good news. We got all new motors. And we're going to issue you whatever it was. We had eight outboard

474
00:52:01.76 --> 00:52:06.08
motors. Yeah. And we're going to give you all new motor motors you know coming turn your

475
00:52:06.08 --> 00:52:11.92
zen and we'll send those off to wherever get repaired or going to go into the garbage can.

476
00:52:11.92 --> 00:52:18.56
And you know Zulu said he said I don't want the new motors. I got my motors. I know where they've been.

477
00:52:18.56 --> 00:52:25.20
I know their personalities. The motors have personalities. Well, the motors have personalities.

478
00:52:25.20 --> 00:52:29.76
And motor melodies. Yeah. They had personalities. Yeah. Motor melodies. Yeah. Motor melodies. And

479
00:52:31.52 --> 00:52:37.12
he wanted to make sure he had a relationship with those motors. He wanted to give them up.

480
00:52:37.12 --> 00:52:41.76
Going back to the book. They're starting to be out on patrol and they're marching up what's

481
00:52:41.76 --> 00:52:48.16
called the Rosebud. H and the five remaining troops headed down the powder and eventually arrived

482
00:52:48.16 --> 00:52:53.12
at the southern bank of the Yellowstone. The wagons had a tough time and it wasn't until

483
00:52:53.12 --> 00:52:57.44
custard taken a troop and scouting out a good road that the heavy wagons could make it.

484
00:52:57.44 --> 00:53:07.04
Custer was mighty good at this kind of work. He had a nose for scouting and finding the best trails.

485
00:53:07.76 --> 00:53:15.28
It was June. It was on June 22nd when we broke camp and started our march up the Rosebud.

486
00:53:16.80 --> 00:53:22.64
This just before we packed our mules, Benteen ordered us to take an extra supply of salt.

487
00:53:22.64 --> 00:53:29.52
That meant we might be living on mule or horse meat before we got back. I suppose we all knew

488
00:53:29.52 --> 00:53:36.48
by this time that we'd be hitting it into dangerous country. But as I look back, I don't believe

489
00:53:36.48 --> 00:53:42.08
many troopers were very worried. We knew there'd be some hard fighting, but a soldier always

490
00:53:42.08 --> 00:53:47.76
feels that it's the other fellow who's going to get it. Never himself. That morning,

491
00:53:47.76 --> 00:53:52.64
words spread about the camp, the male was going to be sent back home and that this would

492
00:53:52.64 --> 00:53:57.92
likely be the last chance to get off letters. Of course, I didn't have any buddy to write to,

493
00:53:57.92 --> 00:54:02.40
but the officers and many of the men heard least scribbled letters to their deer ones.

494
00:54:04.16 --> 00:54:09.52
And as they go to male off these letters, they're on a boat, the troops are on a boat,

495
00:54:09.52 --> 00:54:16.24
and they barely gone 50 feet with these letters to get a male off when the boat was overturned.

496
00:54:16.24 --> 00:54:20.40
And all three men disappeared along with the male sack.

497
00:54:23.20 --> 00:54:27.28
Now, here's the orders that they go get as they're going up. These are actually the orders to

498
00:54:27.28 --> 00:54:32.16
custard. Again, what's awesome is these are documented. This isn't the hearsay. These are documented

499
00:54:32.16 --> 00:54:39.60
orders. Colonel, the Brigadier General Commanding directs that as soon as your regiment can be

500
00:54:39.60 --> 00:54:44.48
made ready for the march you proceed up the rose bud in pursuit of the Indians who's

501
00:54:44.48 --> 00:54:52.16
trailed was discovered by major Reno a few days since. It is, of course, impossible to give you any

502
00:54:52.16 --> 00:54:59.04
definite instructions in regard to this movement. And we're not impossible to do so the department

503
00:54:59.04 --> 00:55:04.72
commander places too much confidence in your zeal, energy, and ability to wish to impose

504
00:55:05.44 --> 00:55:10.56
on you precise orders. Pretty. So he's given him, hey, look, here's my general ideas.

505
00:55:10.56 --> 00:55:14.88
Give him some commanders intent, but he doesn't want to give him anything too specific because

506
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.52
he knows he can't. He has no ways going to be in two days. What's going to be happening up there?

507
00:55:20.48 --> 00:55:27.04
He will, however, indicate to you his own views of what action should be and desires that you should

508
00:55:27.04 --> 00:55:33.12
conform to them unless you should see sufficient reason for departing from them. So he gives him

509
00:55:33.12 --> 00:55:37.68
his orders, but he gives them some pretty good leeway to work through. That's why there's some

510
00:55:37.68 --> 00:55:46.56
discussion on whether or not custard disobeyed. It's a long discussion probably with no one

511
00:55:46.56 --> 00:55:55.52
could ever come with a solid conclusion on because there was some leeway in the orders. And

512
00:55:55.52 --> 00:56:01.12
those, that was the leeway that I just read, then the orders continue to go on, but I'm not going

513
00:56:01.12 --> 00:56:07.76
to go into those minor details of them. Back to the book, we hit the trail at five o'clock sharp

514
00:56:07.76 --> 00:56:14.72
that second morning. These guys are up pretty early. Probably had to get up like, I don't know,

515
00:56:14.72 --> 00:56:22.64
430 to get to get to get on the road before 5 o'clock. Around noon, we began past signs of big

516
00:56:22.64 --> 00:56:30.48
Indian camps. As I remember, we made around 33 miles that day. The next day we rode hard to,

517
00:56:30.48 --> 00:56:37.76
there was no foolishness. Custer had a bunch of re and crote scouts ahead with him. And he kept

518
00:56:37.76 --> 00:56:45.12
them covering the ground far off both flanks of a column. We were in Indian country now right enough.

519
00:56:45.76 --> 00:56:51.36
So that's very common. We'd still do that today. You have a main element moving in a

520
00:56:51.36 --> 00:56:57.44
information and out on the flanks. Maybe some high ground. You have other smaller elements that

521
00:56:57.44 --> 00:57:03.52
can protect your flanks and see if there's any problems up ahead. In one place, we halted there

522
00:57:03.52 --> 00:57:09.04
had been a sun dance lodge. The scalp of a white man was still hanging from the ridge pole.

523
00:57:11.28 --> 00:57:16.96
Getting into the Indian country. It was around 8 o'clock when we got orders to saddle up.

524
00:57:17.60 --> 00:57:22.64
We marched about 10 miles when we were halted in the sort of ravine. We've been told to make

525
00:57:22.64 --> 00:57:27.84
as little noise as possible in the light no fires. There'd been no bugle calls for a day or two.

526
00:57:28.64 --> 00:57:33.68
The sun was at our backs. So apparently we were headed straight west now toward the little big horn.

527
00:57:34.56 --> 00:57:39.36
I later learned that the Indians called it greasy grass. I never did know why.

528
00:57:41.36 --> 00:57:46.56
About the time General Custer came back from his scout, word-run around that the Indians had found a

529
00:57:46.56 --> 00:57:52.32
box of hard tack that had dropped from one of Captain Yates's mules. Two or three troopers who had

530
00:57:52.32 --> 00:57:58.16
been sent back to pick up the box had reported seeing two hostels trying to open it with their

531
00:57:58.16 --> 00:58:05.84
Tomahawks. This meant that the Indians held us at us under observation. Apparently Custer had

532
00:58:05.84 --> 00:58:10.24
figured on hiding the command in the ravine during the day and then attacking the big Indian

533
00:58:10.24 --> 00:58:22.16
village on the little big horn at daybreak the next morning. So they know that the Indians know

534
00:58:22.16 --> 00:58:28.16
that they're there. This is why I included that. You're going to hear that kind of over and over again.

535
00:58:28.16 --> 00:58:31.52
Custer's thinking they're going to surprise them and everyone's telling them we're not going to

536
00:58:31.52 --> 00:58:38.000
surprise them. They know we're here. It was Sunday morning June 25th. We were still more than 12

537
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:44.24
miles from the little horn and the Indian village but the Indians knew where we were and all about us.

538
00:58:48.40 --> 00:58:55.44
I approached, I approached his nearer that now so he sees a conversation going on and it's actually

539
00:58:55.44 --> 00:58:59.76
Custer and Ben Tene and they're having a conversation with a couple people including some of the

540
00:58:59.76 --> 00:59:04.80
scouts and he kind of goes over and does a little ease dropping. As I approached, as Neira seemed

541
00:59:04.80 --> 00:59:08.96
respectful and while I was waiting to catch Ben Tene's attention, I couldn't help but over here

542
00:59:08.96 --> 00:59:14.96
part of the conversation. Charlie Reynolds, the famous white scout who was never to see the sunset

543
00:59:14.96 --> 00:59:20.80
that day was talking and I heard him say that there was the biggest bunch of Indians he'd ever

544
00:59:20.80 --> 00:59:27.44
seen over there. Finally I heard Ben Tene say to Custer, hadn't we better keep the regiment together

545
00:59:27.44 --> 00:59:34.56
general? If this is a big camp as they say, we'll need to every man we have. Custer's only answer

546
00:59:34.56 --> 00:59:48.72
was you have your orders. So you can see again Custer is not listening to people, scouts,

547
00:59:48.72 --> 00:59:56.96
reconnaissance units and his other officers that are with him and this is sort of the classic.

548
00:59:57.92 --> 01:00:02.88
You know hey I've got a, I disagree with your plan shut up and do it anyways. You have your order. So that's a

549
01:00:02.88 --> 01:00:12.72
classic example that we were tired and dirty and hungry or horses hadn't had a good drink of

550
01:00:12.72 --> 01:00:20.40
water since the day before and we weren't much better off. We knew right enough that this was the day.

551
01:00:20.40 --> 01:00:26.32
This was it. This was what we've been training and working for all these years. Captain Ben Tene used

552
01:00:26.32 --> 01:00:31.44
to say the government pays you to get shot at and I suppose the dumbest greenest trooper in

553
01:00:31.44 --> 01:00:45.12
the regiment figured that this day he'd get shot at plenty. Here was the seventh cavalry

554
01:00:45.68 --> 01:00:53.28
with a total of some 600 men split up into four outfits. Apparently the Indian scouts

555
01:00:53.28 --> 01:01:03.12
and experienced old guys, guides knew that there were several thousand of the hostels but it was

556
01:01:03.12 --> 01:01:08.16
it is my belief that Custer and most of our officers thought that after whips somewhere between

557
01:01:08.16 --> 01:01:13.68
a thousand and fifteen hundred and they expected most of these to be poorly armed and poorly led.

558
01:01:15.04 --> 01:01:20.72
From experience they figured the Indians would fight only a rear guard action while the women,

559
01:01:20.72 --> 01:01:27.04
children, old men and pony herds got away but in place of a maximum of fifteen hundred

560
01:01:27.04 --> 01:01:32.56
Indian warriors it developed that there were possibly twice that number about to face Custer's total of

561
01:01:32.56 --> 01:01:46.08
600. So that's the report that they're getting and it's there's a little bit of controversy about

562
01:01:46.08 --> 01:01:53.52
what how many Indians were there but it was a lot and here here we go this I'm going to jump

563
01:01:53.52 --> 01:01:59.20
forward to another section and talking about Custer and did Custer the name of the chapter is

564
01:01:59.20 --> 01:02:04.64
did Custer and it's sort of a appendix so it's not part of the story it's after the story but it

565
01:02:04.64 --> 01:02:10.48
talks about did Custer refuse advice from his scouts how many Indian warriors were camped on the

566
01:02:10.48 --> 01:02:16.08
West Bank of the Little Big Horn that Sunday morning of June 25th against the real figure how many

567
01:02:16.08 --> 01:02:21.36
Custer think he would have to fight did Custer refuse to believe the estimated number of warriors

568
01:02:21.36 --> 01:02:26.32
his scouts told him he would have to fight did he fail to follow the advice of his experienced

569
01:02:26.32 --> 01:02:31.44
guides and interpreters one of the best accounts of what the guides thought about the number of

570
01:02:31.44 --> 01:02:38.000
Indians and the chances of Custer closing with them is contained in the excellent book William Jackson

571
01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:45.60
Indian Scout by James William Schultz, Willard Schultz, it is worth careful reading and here's a

572
01:02:45.60 --> 01:02:53.92
couple excerpts from that on the third day we struck the trail of the hostels the one that Reno had

573
01:02:53.92 --> 01:03:02.24
found several days before said bloody knife now remember bloody knife is is Custer's you know

574
01:03:02.24 --> 01:03:11.76
main scout their their type said bloody knife my friends the bit this big trail proves what we heard

575
01:03:13.28 --> 01:03:22.16
that the Ogalala the Minicon Jew the Sandsark and the Teton Sue have left their agencies to

576
01:03:22.16 --> 01:03:28.96
join sitting bull and crazy horse horse I'm sure that even this trail does not account for all

577
01:03:28.96 --> 01:03:36.16
that have left their agencies they're surely our other trails and trails two of the shy ants and the

578
01:03:36.16 --> 01:03:47.12
apraprohose bloody knife continued it is as I have told long hair this gathering of enemy tribes

579
01:03:47.68 --> 01:03:56.80
is too many for us but he will not believe me he is bound to lead us against them they are not far away

580
01:03:56.80 --> 01:04:02.40
just over this ridge they are all in camp and waiting for us crazy horse and sitting bull are not

581
01:04:02.40 --> 01:04:07.76
men without sense they have their scouts too and some of them surely have their eyes upon us

582
01:04:08.72 --> 01:04:16.64
well tomorrow we are going to have a big fight a losing fight myself I know what is to happen to me

583
01:04:16.64 --> 01:04:21.60
my sacred helper is giving me warning that I am not to see the set of tomorrow's sun

584
01:04:21.60 --> 01:04:30.000
sad words those they chilled us I saw Charlie Reynolds nod and agreement to them

585
01:04:30.56 --> 01:04:37.12
and was chilled again when he said in a low voice I feel as he does tomorrow will be the end for me too

586
01:04:38.48 --> 01:04:43.92
anyone who wants my little outfit of stuff pointing to his war pack can have it now

587
01:04:46.24 --> 01:04:50.56
lieutenant Varna who is in charge of the scouts came over and said that it was general

588
01:04:50.56 --> 01:04:56.96
custards planned to attempt to surprise attack on the camp of the enemy said bloody knife

589
01:04:56.96 --> 01:05:04.000
we cannot surprise the enemy they are not crazy without dumb without doubt their scouts have

590
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:15.52
watched every move we have made convinced at last that we could not possibly surprise the

591
01:05:15.52 --> 01:05:21.52
enemy general custer ordered a quick advance with the scouts and himself in the lead

592
01:05:23.04 --> 01:05:27.60
we had not gone far when bloody knife and his two reeds joined us and reported that on the other

593
01:05:27.60 --> 01:05:32.48
side of the ridge they had found the day old trail of many more enemy going toward the valley of

594
01:05:32.48 --> 01:05:39.76
little big horn they were excited and said to custer general we have discovered the camp

595
01:05:39.76 --> 01:05:44.56
down there on the little big horn it is a big one too big for you to tackle why there are

596
01:05:44.56 --> 01:05:50.08
thousands and thousands of sue and shions down there for moment the general stared at him

597
01:05:50.08 --> 01:06:01.12
angley I thought and then said sternly I shall attack them classic ego maniac right here sorry but

598
01:06:01.12 --> 01:06:10.96
that's what this is yeah custer gave orders for attack upon the camp none of the scouts had

599
01:06:10.96 --> 01:06:16.64
been far in the lead and they all came in reeds and crows and whites and Robert and I we were

600
01:06:16.64 --> 01:06:23.92
gathering of solemn faces speaking in English and the sign language too so that all would understand

601
01:06:23.92 --> 01:06:30.96
brood described the enemy camp it was he said all of three miles long and made up of hundreds of

602
01:06:30.96 --> 01:06:36.40
lodges hundreds and hundreds of lodges above it and below it and west of it there were thousands

603
01:06:36.40 --> 01:06:42.96
and thousands of horses that were being close herded with his few riders long hair decided to

604
01:06:42.96 --> 01:06:49.92
attack the camp and we were going to have a terrible fight we should all take courage fight hard

605
01:06:49.92 --> 01:06:57.44
make our every shot a killer he finished a nun spoke but after a minute or two bloody knife

606
01:06:57.44 --> 01:07:03.04
looked up and signed to the sun I shall not see you go down behind the mountains tonight

607
01:07:03.04 --> 01:07:10.80
and that that I almost choked I felt he knew his end was near and there was no escaping it

608
01:07:10.80 --> 01:07:16.72
I turned and looked the other way I thought that my own end was near I felt very sad

609
01:07:18.08 --> 01:07:25.12
so there's the full account of these all the scouts some are you know some are white

610
01:07:25.12 --> 01:07:30.96
some are Indian Native Americans different tribes and they're all telling them the same thing

611
01:07:30.96 --> 01:07:40.56
hmm this is not a good plan so back to the book apparently cost her had planned to stay in hiding

612
01:07:40.56 --> 01:07:45.12
in the ravine we had reached a little after 10 o'clock that Sunday and then attacked the

613
01:07:45.12 --> 01:07:49.92
village a daybreak the next morning of the 26 that would more or less have doubled tailed

614
01:07:49.92 --> 01:07:55.36
and deterries idea of boxing the Indians but when he found the hostile scouts had discovered his

615
01:07:55.36 --> 01:08:07.04
column he figured there was nothing to do but attack it once

616
01:08:08.08 --> 01:08:14.88
now we get a little um a little report here from a guy named

617
01:08:15.92 --> 01:08:24.08
Sergeant Daniel Knapp who had barely turned 23 at the time of the battle in Knapp's own account

618
01:08:24.08 --> 01:08:30.96
of the fight published in the magazine of the historical society of Montana he said when we got to

619
01:08:30.96 --> 01:08:36.72
the top of the buffs the Indians had disappeared but we were in plain view of the Indian camps which

620
01:08:36.72 --> 01:08:42.16
appeared to cover a space of about two miles wide and four miles long on the west side of the river

621
01:08:43.12 --> 01:08:51.12
we were then charging at full speed this camp is two miles wide that's a map two miles

622
01:08:51.12 --> 01:08:56.40
two but it four two by four miles and you got 600 guys and actually they didn't even

623
01:08:56.40 --> 01:09:04.000
cost her to have six of her guys to get 200 guys Reno and his troops were again seen to our

624
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.20
left moving at full speed down the valley at the site of the Indian camps the boys of our five

625
01:09:09.20 --> 01:09:16.000
troops began to cheer over confidence some of the horses became so excited that the riders were

626
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.04
unable to hold them in ranks and the last word I heard general custer say were hold your

627
01:09:21.04 --> 01:09:27.44
horses in boys there are plenty of them down there for all of us again now we have total

628
01:09:27.44 --> 01:09:32.80
overconfidence in the situation we think we're gonna win this is gonna be fun oh there's a

629
01:09:32.80 --> 01:09:41.36
two by four mile big camp no big deal I got 500 guys with me so this is where the force is split up

630
01:09:41.36 --> 01:09:47.36
and custer goes off to attack it seems like he goes about a mile away mile and a half away

631
01:09:47.36 --> 01:09:51.04
and again I'm gonna make the same statement that I said when I talked about the battle with

632
01:09:51.84 --> 01:09:57.92
when we did the wooden leg podcast I'm not trying to historically reconstruct the battle right now

633
01:09:57.92 --> 01:10:05.28
there's plenty of books that do that so I'm just kind of assembling the broad design of what's happening

634
01:10:07.92 --> 01:10:13.12
so now the forces split up Reno and Benteen are kind of have troops and holding but they're

635
01:10:13.12 --> 01:10:18.72
starting to get a little firefight themselves we saw a second figure in uniform writing towards us

636
01:10:19.44 --> 01:10:25.20
he was trumpeter martini of my company who had been assigned that morning as a special orderly

637
01:10:25.20 --> 01:10:31.36
trumpeter to general custer I learned afterwards that he had a message from custer to Benteen

638
01:10:31.36 --> 01:10:37.04
that had been scribbled out on a field order pad and signed by lieutenant cook the agitant

639
01:10:37.04 --> 01:10:49.28
it read Benteen come on big village be quick bring packs yes bring pack so that's the note

640
01:10:49.28 --> 01:10:57.44
that they get from custer sounds like custer might have once he split off things started going sideways real

641
01:10:57.44 --> 01:11:07.04
quick they again Benteen and Reno have their troops start now getting engaged in a firefight

642
01:11:08.32 --> 01:11:13.36
back to the book we could hear heavy firing now before long we passed several crow or re-scouts

643
01:11:13.36 --> 01:11:17.68
driving a few head of Indian ponies and they shouted soldiers in pointed toward the

644
01:11:17.68 --> 01:11:22.08
bluffs that were rising towards the north we knew that we were close to the valley of little big

645
01:11:22.08 --> 01:11:25.52
horn and that's somewhere in this neighborhood there was hard fighting going on

646
01:11:25.52 --> 01:11:31.28
Benteen ordered us to draw pistols and we charged up the bluffs that had gallop expecting at any moment

647
01:11:31.28 --> 01:11:37.44
to run into hostels when we reached the brow with the first set of rolling hills the river valley

648
01:11:37.44 --> 01:11:43.52
suddenly opened up below us to our left it was a sight to strike terror in the hearts of the

649
01:11:43.52 --> 01:11:50.32
bravest men down there in the valley maybe 150 feet or more below us and somewhere around a half

650
01:11:50.32 --> 01:11:56.80
a mile away there were figure galloping on horseback and much shooting farther down the river there were

651
01:11:56.80 --> 01:12:04.48
great masses of mounted men we suspicion were Indians we were going at it at fast clip ourselves

652
01:12:04.48 --> 01:12:11.20
and we had no more than caught the swift glimpse of this tragic battlefield below when we saw

653
01:12:11.20 --> 01:12:17.12
mounted and dismounted soldiers on a null of a hill onto the northward we swiftly rode towards them

654
01:12:17.12 --> 01:12:23.92
so these guys are seeing this massive battle take place they're kind of on the high ground

655
01:12:26.80 --> 01:12:35.84
he talks about here what kind of weaponry the the Indians had for my part I believe that fully

656
01:12:35.84 --> 01:12:41.04
half of the warriors carried only bows and arrows and lances and that possibly half of the

657
01:12:41.04 --> 01:12:45.84
remainder carried odds and end of old muzzle loaders and single shot rifles of various

658
01:12:45.84 --> 01:12:51.92
vintage's probably not more than 25 or 30% of the warriors carried modern repeating rifles that

659
01:12:51.92 --> 01:12:56.000
sounds pretty close to what wooden legs said they said they mostly had bows and arrows they

660
01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:02.40
some guys had rifles but it was mostly bows and arrows and one other port Indian boys from 14

661
01:13:02.40 --> 01:13:08.24
years old up accompanied the warriors and took part especially in the later stages of the fighting

662
01:13:08.24 --> 01:13:14.88
the soldiers incidentally were armed with single shot 45 70 caliber springfield carbines and

663
01:13:14.88 --> 01:13:21.60
accurate and deadly weapon up to 600 yards but when fired rapidly the breach became foul and the

664
01:13:21.60 --> 01:13:26.96
greasy cartridges is often jammed it could not be removed by the extractor this meant that the

665
01:13:26.96 --> 01:13:32.64
empty shell had to be forced out by the blade of a hunting knife this very fact was responsible for

666
01:13:32.64 --> 01:13:37.76
the death of many a trooper this hot Sunday and may actually have been the indirect cause of the

667
01:13:37.76 --> 01:13:44.88
great disaster weapons getting dirty weapons getting hot dirty got to take care of your weapon it sounds

668
01:13:44.88 --> 01:13:49.92
like this was beyond them just taking care of their weapon sounds like it was a design issue as well

669
01:13:52.40 --> 01:13:58.80
Reno had crossed the river and had his troops in line of columns of four with the Indian

670
01:13:59.84 --> 01:14:04.88
with the Indian scouts on his left soon Indian horsemen were seen riding madly two and

671
01:14:04.88 --> 01:14:12.32
throw in the valley and shortly the southern end of the Indian camps came in to view Reno now

672
01:14:12.32 --> 01:14:17.44
had his three troops and scouts thrown out in a skirmish line covering possibly the full width of the

673
01:14:17.44 --> 01:14:23.60
narrow valley so there they see the enemy now they get online that's a very common thing if you can picture

674
01:14:23.60 --> 01:14:30.56
this you've got your guys in a column how many if you're in a column of three three columns and you

675
01:14:30.56 --> 01:14:36.08
see the enemy ahead of you how many people do you think can shoot the three the three the three of

676
01:14:36.08 --> 01:14:40.40
the front so that's why you keep hearing this this idea of a skirmish line and it's the same tactic

677
01:14:40.40 --> 01:14:45.68
that we use now oh we got enemy in front of us cool we're gonna get online they call it a skirmish line here

678
01:14:45.68 --> 01:14:52.08
we would call it a get online like they'll they spread out red on the yep so now they get they got

679
01:14:52.08 --> 01:14:59.60
50 guys cool that 50 guns online instead of three yeah realizing that this charged toward the

680
01:14:59.60 --> 01:15:05.68
Indian hordes would end in almost certain disaster Reno now orders troops to dismount and fight on foot

681
01:15:05.68 --> 01:15:11.92
even before this order came scores of Indians had swung to the southwestward and pressed against

682
01:15:11.92 --> 01:15:17.60
the crow and re-scouts these were forced to give way things were looking bad for Reno any

683
01:15:17.60 --> 01:15:22.24
order to skirmish lines to fall back to the edge of a heavy grove of cotton woods that followed

684
01:15:22.24 --> 01:15:27.28
a bend in the river and jutted out halfway across the valley the horses were led into the woods

685
01:15:27.28 --> 01:15:34.08
wall a thin line of man held three sides of the grove some 90 men were holding not less than 250 yards

686
01:15:34.08 --> 01:15:40.56
of line hundreds of mounted Indians were now half circling the skirmish line writing in close

687
01:15:40.56 --> 01:15:46.24
firing from under their ponies next and then galloping away Reno's men were now either firing

688
01:15:46.24 --> 01:15:51.44
from a prone position or using the bank of a dry creek bed as a bearer create and rifle rest

689
01:15:51.44 --> 01:15:58.16
so Reno's guys are now getting basically surrounded in taking up this new position sergeant or

690
01:15:58.16 --> 01:16:04.08
hair of troop m had been killed the first man on the skirmish line to die apparently Reno had a

691
01:16:04.08 --> 01:16:09.28
fairly defendable position and some people think if he had pulled in his lines and consolidated

692
01:16:09.28 --> 01:16:15.28
in his position he might have held out here for an indefinite length of time or at least as long

693
01:16:15.28 --> 01:16:22.72
as his ammunition lasted but the savage yells the heavy firing the smoke and dust all and fear

694
01:16:22.72 --> 01:16:30.72
all combined to fog his judgment suddenly custers favorite scout bloody knife was shot through

695
01:16:30.72 --> 01:16:37.36
the head and his brain scattered all over Reno then the scout dorm in fell and Charlie Reynolds

696
01:16:37.36 --> 01:16:43.44
was shot through the head Reno figuring that his only chance lay and getting to high ground across

697
01:16:43.44 --> 01:16:49.44
the river shattered for his men to mount up in company formation two troop commanders heard the order

698
01:16:49.44 --> 01:16:54.48
and amid the confusion and excitement had their men mount up and line in column of force

699
01:16:55.44 --> 01:17:01.68
the third troop G under Lieutenant Mackintosh himself part Indian who had been adopted by

700
01:17:01.68 --> 01:17:06.64
general Mackintosh was in the woods and did not get the order until the two other troops

701
01:17:06.64 --> 01:17:11.36
with Reno writing at their head were racing upstream trying to find a place to cross the river

702
01:17:11.36 --> 01:17:20.88
all order and discipline were gone so they're surrounded things fall apart he's basically saying

703
01:17:20.88 --> 01:17:25.60
we got a retreat we got to get out of here and the assessment was that maybe they were in a

704
01:17:25.60 --> 01:17:29.76
defendable position they could have held there who knows who knows whether that's true or not

705
01:17:32.08 --> 01:17:37.36
nobody will ever know how any man escaped alive from this mad retreat

706
01:17:37.36 --> 01:17:43.68
all we are sure of is that the charging troop broke through the cordon of mounted Indians

707
01:17:43.68 --> 01:17:49.60
and followed a buffalo craft to the river here they somehow managed to jump their horses

708
01:17:49.60 --> 01:17:55.12
over a four or five foot bank plunged across the stream and scrambled up a narrow trail

709
01:17:55.12 --> 01:18:00.96
to the steep hills to the east hundreds of Indians fired indiscriminately into the pan

710
01:18:00.96 --> 01:18:08.80
extra consulgers and the wonder is that any trooper escaped no motion picture could be as fantastic

711
01:18:08.80 --> 01:18:18.08
as this wild milling of frightened men and horses again just to remind you that this is what's

712
01:18:18.08 --> 01:18:22.48
happening with Reno in his group they don't know where customers right now with his crew of

713
01:18:22.48 --> 01:18:30.000
200 guys back to the book in all 26 troopers and scouts and three officers were killed

714
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.72
either in this ride through the Indian gauntlet or back at the edge of the woods

715
01:18:35.44 --> 01:18:43.04
of the 19 men left behind 17 cross the river and reached Reno Hill on foot within two hours

716
01:18:44.16 --> 01:18:50.16
Lieutenant Darudio and private O'Neill did not join us until 36 hours later

717
01:18:50.72 --> 01:18:56.88
they came right through where I was on guard it was now somewhere around 330 in the afternoon

718
01:18:56.88 --> 01:19:03.20
Reno shaken and unnerved and reached the hilltop and here his frightened troopers were joining him

719
01:19:04.08 --> 01:19:06.80
he was whipped and completely disorganized

720
01:19:10.40 --> 01:19:15.28
this is a rally point and if you have a pre-designated rally point

721
01:19:16.48 --> 01:19:20.64
and you say hey guys look you see this big hill over here if everything goes to hell

722
01:19:20.64 --> 01:19:27.92
again we get all jumbled up go to that point it doesn't sound like he actually pre-brief that

723
01:19:27.92 --> 01:19:30.72
because that would have been a you could have just said hey back to the rally point you could have

724
01:19:30.72 --> 01:19:35.92
been a very clear order if you're trying to not really know where you're going and you're saying

725
01:19:35.92 --> 01:19:40.80
retreat well you don't do it in a very organized fashion so pre-plants some contingencies

726
01:19:40.80 --> 01:19:53.44
hmm now they get in this position and Reno like I said is in rough shape back to the book cool

727
01:19:53.44 --> 01:19:59.84
capable bending more or less assumed command major Runu Reno had just come through a terrible

728
01:19:59.84 --> 01:20:06.08
experience and at the moment was glad to have bending his junior take over quickly bending

729
01:20:06.08 --> 01:20:11.12
dismounted his own three troops and ordered us to form a scourmet line Reno's men had

730
01:20:11.12 --> 01:20:17.92
expanded most of their ammunition so we were told to divide ours with them we had bantines 120

731
01:20:17.92 --> 01:20:24.32
men intact and there were around 60 men who'd been fighting in the valley with Reno

732
01:20:25.04 --> 01:20:29.44
and even before we got the kinks out of our legs from our long horse hours in the saddle

733
01:20:29.44 --> 01:20:35.68
we were asking each other where's custard what had become of custer and his five

734
01:20:35.68 --> 01:20:44.000
troops apparently custer was now much farther on to the northward and in this moment was

735
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:49.76
hotly engaged but no one was certain all we knew was that he had disappeared with almost half the

736
01:20:49.76 --> 01:20:56.16
regiment we could hear the sound of distant firing echoing through the hills and valleys from that

737
01:20:56.16 --> 01:21:03.92
direction custer must be down there so this is happening they're in the skirmish position

738
01:21:03.92 --> 01:21:11.20
and they're starting to try and get reorganized back to the book the wounded man who could

739
01:21:11.20 --> 01:21:17.04
mount were put on horses but the others were carried in blankets by details of six troopers on foot

740
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:23.36
takes a lot of people to carry a downman downman takes a lot of people to carry a downman and in

741
01:21:23.36 --> 01:21:31.60
this case it takes six people to carry one downman nowadays we weigh a lot more we got we got all

742
01:21:31.60 --> 01:21:40.24
reguns we got body armor it's hot guys are heavy pretty soon it looked as if the Indian

743
01:21:40.24 --> 01:21:46.72
masses were coming towards us it didn't take long to realize that this was true here we were

744
01:21:46.72 --> 01:21:52.24
stretched out all over hell's half acre a troop on this hill mob another in this little valley

745
01:21:52.24 --> 01:22:00.000
in a third and over there a third troop behind at a slow walk came packed trains the wounded men

746
01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:06.48
and the rear guard we know and venting both sense danger in order to withdraw the advanced

747
01:22:06.48 --> 01:22:14.40
troops were dismounting and fought as skirmishers in the center in a slight depression the horses

748
01:22:14.40 --> 01:22:22.24
and mules were staked and an inadequate little field hospital was established but it was impossible

749
01:22:22.24 --> 01:22:27.52
to shield the man and stock from the Indians firing from a hilltop off to the east in the

750
01:22:27.52 --> 01:22:32.000
Indians got some high ground on them can't stop them what do you think I got high ground you you can't

751
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:38.64
hide animal after animals killed and the men were hit it was tough not to be able to do something

752
01:22:38.64 --> 01:22:46.64
about it we'd hardly got settled on our own skirmish line with h men posted at 20 foot intervals

753
01:22:46.64 --> 01:22:53.84
when the Indians at all but completely surrounded us and the fighting began in earnest there was

754
01:22:53.84 --> 01:22:58.24
no full fledged charge but little groups of Indians would creep up as close as they could get

755
01:22:58.24 --> 01:23:04.24
and from behind bushes or little noils open fire they'd practiced all kinds of cute tricks to

756
01:23:04.24 --> 01:23:08.88
draw our fire maybe a naked red skin would suddenly jump to his feet and while you drew a

757
01:23:08.88 --> 01:23:18.40
beat on him he'd thrown himself to the ground they're under this attack for a pretty good amount

758
01:23:18.40 --> 01:23:26.48
of time and then finally the sun went down that night like a ball of fire pretty soon the quick

759
01:23:26.48 --> 01:23:33.12
Montana twilight settled down on us and then came the chill of the high planes there was no moon

760
01:23:33.12 --> 01:23:40.56
and no one ever welcomed darkness more than we did we felt terribly alone on that dangerous hilltop

761
01:23:40.56 --> 01:23:49.36
we were million miles from nowhere and death was all around us all through that short black night

762
01:23:49.36 --> 01:23:55.92
the orgy went on down below in the river valley it struck fear in our hearts just as the

763
01:23:55.92 --> 01:24:01.36
mystery of custards disappearance made our blood run cold each time we tried to solve it where was

764
01:24:01.36 --> 01:24:08.56
custer what had happened to him so down they're up there they're hiding it's dark

765
01:24:08.56 --> 01:24:14.80
they're scared they got wounded and all they hear down in the valley is the Indians going crazy

766
01:24:14.80 --> 01:24:18.56
the rhythm of the tom tom's the wild victory dance they can hear all this

767
01:24:22.16 --> 01:24:26.24
back to the book they're talking about custer they could not all be killed not lucky

768
01:24:26.24 --> 01:24:32.48
custer and those five gallant troops who rolled with him why did he abandon us in those three

769
01:24:32.48 --> 01:24:37.68
bloody hours before darkness had saved us we had no less than a dozen men killed and three times

770
01:24:37.68 --> 01:24:44.40
that number wounded he's actually saying man where was custer here we were getting crushed on the

771
01:24:44.40 --> 01:24:53.44
battlefield and custer's not there to support us where to go now during the night it rains a little

772
01:24:53.44 --> 01:25:00.96
bit and finally the sun starts to come up and just as the sun starts to come up and starts

773
01:25:00.96 --> 01:25:06.000
getting light back to the book Joan said something about taking off his overcoat he started to roll

774
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:12.16
on his side so he could get his arms and shoulders out without exposing himself to fire suddenly

775
01:25:12.16 --> 01:25:20.80
I heard him cry out he'd been shot straight through the heart minute or two later another bullet

776
01:25:20.80 --> 01:25:26.88
from the hilltop torn to the hickory butt of my rifle splitting it squarely into I was plenty

777
01:25:26.88 --> 01:25:32.88
mad because my army carbine wouldn't let me return the compliment so he just got shot the rifle

778
01:25:32.88 --> 01:25:39.20
stock actually happened one of my guys in in Ramadi one of my guys got his his rifle stock up

779
01:25:39.20 --> 01:25:46.24
blown up by an RPG I seem to come fall out of a sniper position and he's got his his weapon

780
01:25:46.24 --> 01:25:58.64
is in two pieces I'm thinking no lucky to be alive along about this time our 30 or 40 wounded men

781
01:25:58.64 --> 01:26:05.44
began crying out for water h-trupe held the hill here on the southwest there was a draw that

782
01:26:05.44 --> 01:26:09.92
ran down the west side of the hill to the river it was a rough and exposed and it looked like a

783
01:26:09.92 --> 01:26:14.24
dead cinch that anyone who tried to work his way down that drug the river would be killed

784
01:26:15.20 --> 01:26:20.40
Indians concealed in the bushes across the river were firing up at us and they had every foot of

785
01:26:20.40 --> 01:26:27.92
this draw on riverbank covered but we had to do something for those men who were up wounded crying

786
01:26:27.92 --> 01:26:35.76
for water finally benteen called for volunteers I think there were 17 of us all together who step forward

787
01:26:36.64 --> 01:26:42.72
he detailed four of us from h who were extra good marksman to take up an exposed position on the

788
01:26:42.72 --> 01:26:48.08
brow of the hill facing the river we were to stand up and not only draw the fire of the Indians

789
01:26:48.08 --> 01:26:52.80
below but we were to pump as much lettuce we could into the bushes where the Indians were hiding

790
01:26:52.80 --> 01:26:57.76
while the water party hurried down to the draw got their buckets and pots and canteens filled

791
01:26:57.76 --> 01:27:04.96
and then made their way back so we got a little cover move happening obviously it just happened that

792
01:27:04.96 --> 01:27:11.36
the four of us who were posted on the hill were all German boys, Giger, Meckling, Voight and myself

793
01:27:11.36 --> 01:27:16.32
none of us were for wounded although we stood exposed on that ridge for more than 20 minutes

794
01:27:16.32 --> 01:27:21.84
and they threw plenty of lettuce several of the water party however were badly wounded although

795
01:27:21.84 --> 01:27:27.04
we kept the steady fire into the bushes where the Indians were hiding each of us was given a

796
01:27:27.04 --> 01:27:34.32
congressional metal of honor you don't think about that you don't think about you you actually

797
01:27:34.32 --> 01:27:38.16
gonna need water you run out of water you're gonna get guys dehydrated and a dinosaur you're

798
01:27:38.16 --> 01:27:46.24
gonna risk people's lives to go get water benteen had been walking up and down the line urging

799
01:27:46.24 --> 01:27:52.08
men to hold fast not to waste their fire and to keep cool I remember saying to him Colonel you

800
01:27:52.08 --> 01:27:57.20
better get down sir you'll get killed don't worry about me he answered grimly I'm all right

801
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:04.32
he sure lived a charmed life that day but things look bad and finally benteen hurried to the

802
01:28:04.32 --> 01:28:09.44
north side of the lines and asked major reno for reinforcements he made it clear that the Indians were

803
01:28:09.44 --> 01:28:14.56
about to charge his line and if they were able to sweep over it the whole outfit would be destroyed

804
01:28:15.20 --> 01:28:20.40
reno told him to take as much of mtrupe as he could gather those men certainly look good to us

805
01:28:20.40 --> 01:28:27.92
soon after they came up captain benteen led the charge yelling and firing we went at the double

806
01:28:27.92 --> 01:28:33.12
quick and the Indians broken ran when we had cleaned them out for a hundred yards ahead of us

807
01:28:33.12 --> 01:28:37.92
we hustled back to our holes once again we settled back to the business of getting fired at

808
01:28:37.92 --> 01:28:44.08
with men hit at intervals with men hit at intervals and with the poor horses and mules taking a

809
01:28:44.08 --> 01:28:49.76
terrible beating in their hollow it must have been a long time about long about this time that

810
01:28:49.76 --> 01:28:55.92
benteen called me to attention and made me sergeant we had one sergeant two men killed and 12

811
01:28:55.92 --> 01:29:03.12
wounded and aged treep alone so once again we see some aggressive and we also see some focus

812
01:29:03.12 --> 01:29:07.20
of forces right we see some prior exercise next to you hey we're gonna get over run this our

813
01:29:07.20 --> 01:29:11.12
biggest problem right now is we're gonna get over run so you know what hey major reno give me a

814
01:29:11.12 --> 01:29:15.76
bunch of guys and we're gonna go do an aggressive assault and take care of this number one priority

815
01:29:15.76 --> 01:29:20.88
so let's focus our forces on that here we go and that's what they did they got aggressive and got after it

816
01:29:23.44 --> 01:29:27.44
back to the book the gun fired almost ceased and some of us left our trenches and stood in

817
01:29:27.44 --> 01:29:32.96
little groups on the brow of the hill then something happened that I'll never forget if I lived to be

818
01:29:32.96 --> 01:29:38.40
a hundred the heavy smokes seem to lift for a few moments and they're in the valley below we

819
01:29:38.40 --> 01:29:43.68
caught glimpses of the thousands of Indians on foot and horseback with their pony hordes

820
01:29:43.68 --> 01:29:49.68
with their pony herds dogs and pack animals and all the trappings of a great camp solely

821
01:29:49.68 --> 01:29:57.20
moving southward it was like some biblical Exodus the Israelites moving into Egypt's a mighty

822
01:29:57.20 --> 01:30:02.64
tribe on the march we thought at first that it must be some trick that the Indians were only

823
01:30:02.64 --> 01:30:07.68
moving their families from danger and that the warriors would soon return and try to overwhelm us

824
01:30:08.48 --> 01:30:14.96
patiently we waited in our little trenches along June afternoon dragged on the firing at all

825
01:30:14.96 --> 01:30:20.40
but ceased the smoke in the valley had blown away and the last Indian had gone

826
01:30:23.44 --> 01:30:28.32
then reno ordered the whole camp to move as close to the river as possible we would get as far as

827
01:30:28.32 --> 01:30:34.80
ways we could from the terrible stench of death there was plenty of water now for the wounded

828
01:30:34.80 --> 01:30:40.40
and towards the evening the company cooks made us the best meal they could at least we had

829
01:30:40.40 --> 01:30:49.60
hot coffee and plenty of bacon and so card tack it was our first meal in 36 hours then night came

830
01:30:49.60 --> 01:30:56.16
down we were weary but while those on guard were awake and alert the rest of the command slept

831
01:30:56.16 --> 01:31:03.76
but it was an uneasy sleep we still had heard no word from costor we began to suspicion

832
01:31:03.76 --> 01:31:10.48
that some terrible fate might have overtaken him what it was we could only guess

833
01:31:15.04 --> 01:31:20.64
the sun was well in the sky that next morning of the 27th we saw dust rising slowly from the

834
01:31:20.64 --> 01:31:27.44
valley northward so then they get approached by a young officer that had been out scouting what was

835
01:31:27.44 --> 01:31:34.88
happening a young officer phung himself off his horse he was lieutenant Bradley chief of scouts

836
01:31:34.88 --> 01:31:39.04
early this morning scouting in the hills on the east side a little horn lieutenant Bradley had

837
01:31:39.04 --> 01:31:45.76
come across a battlefield dotted with the white bodies of dead men he had counted more than 190 dead

838
01:31:45.76 --> 01:31:52.000
he was certain that costor was among them apparently no white man had escaped one or two

839
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:58.48
crow scouts notably young curly had reported at the steamer far west at the junction of little

840
01:31:58.48 --> 01:32:05.12
big horn and big horn the day before there had been no interpreter on hand but curly had to

841
01:32:05.12 --> 01:32:11.36
convince the officers that all white soldiers who rode with custard had been killed at dawn

842
01:32:11.36 --> 01:32:16.80
lieutenant Bradley in a few men and a few men had started out to search for the field of tragedy

843
01:32:16.80 --> 01:32:22.72
curly was right no soldier a white man had escaped a little later the slight figure

844
01:32:24.16 --> 01:32:29.20
of bearded general Terry with his staff and a small escort arrived on the hill

845
01:32:30.32 --> 01:32:35.36
there were tears running down as cheeks when he spoke I think most of us had tears in our eyes

846
01:32:35.36 --> 01:32:42.80
too more than 200 of our comrades had met a violent death and now naked and unbearied were lying

847
01:32:42.80 --> 01:32:57.04
in the hot Montana 7 3 miles northward so they go out to recover the bodies or bury the bodies

848
01:32:57.04 --> 01:33:02.56
their own patrol back to the book suddenly we caught glimpses of white objects lying along

849
01:33:02.56 --> 01:33:10.24
the ridge that led northward we pulled up our horses this was the battlefield here

850
01:33:10.24 --> 01:33:17.60
custard's lap luck had finally run out from the way the men lay it was clear that the first

851
01:33:17.60 --> 01:33:23.20
one troop had been ordered to dismount and fight as a skirmish line then a second troop had been

852
01:33:23.20 --> 01:33:30.40
posted a little further on and to the east then a third troop and a fourth and finally

853
01:33:30.40 --> 01:33:36.08
there on the knob of a hill lay some 30 bodies in a small circle we knew instinctively

854
01:33:37.36 --> 01:33:43.68
we would find custard there we rode forward at a walk most of the troopers had been stripped of clothing

855
01:33:43.68 --> 01:33:49.84
and scalp some of them had been horribly mutilated custard was lying a trifle to the southeast

856
01:33:50.64 --> 01:33:58.08
of the top of the no where the monument is today i stood six feet away holding cap and bent

857
01:33:58.08 --> 01:34:04.32
teens horse while he had identified the general his body had not been touched save for a single bullet

858
01:34:04.32 --> 01:34:11.76
hole in the left temple near the ear and a hole on his left breast he looked almost as if it

859
01:34:11.76 --> 01:34:17.68
had been peaceably sleeping his brother Tom lay a few feet away he was terribly mutilated

860
01:34:18.80 --> 01:34:24.56
scattered over the field where the swollen bodies of the dead horses but there were not many of them

861
01:34:24.56 --> 01:34:29.44
it seemed clear that the Indians sweeping up from the draws and coolees on all sides had

862
01:34:29.44 --> 01:34:34.88
stampeded the mounts while the men were fighting dismounted from every direction

863
01:34:34.88 --> 01:34:40.16
hordes of crazed Indians must have attacked with the wild courage that their desperation and

864
01:34:40.16 --> 01:34:48.24
hate gave them nothing could check their mad charges captain bentine found a bit of wood

865
01:34:48.24 --> 01:34:54.64
hollowed out a hole found an empty shell wrote custer's name on a bit of paper

866
01:34:54.64 --> 01:35:00.000
and placed it in the shell and shoved the deep in the hole in the piece of wood then he pushed

867
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:06.16
this into the ground at custer's head it would make sure that the burial party would identify

868
01:35:06.16 --> 01:35:14.24
custer's body the following morning we went back to custer hill and buried as well as we could

869
01:35:14.24 --> 01:35:23.92
the naked mutilated bodies of our comrades it was a gruesome task the custer may have made a

870
01:35:23.92 --> 01:35:30.88
mistake to divide his command that Sunday afternoon of June 25th but the gods themselves were against him

871
01:35:32.56 --> 01:35:35.20
it was the Indians day

872
01:35:35.20 --> 01:35:47.52
and I'm gonna go back to finish this up to the section of the book that we started at

873
01:35:48.56 --> 01:35:53.84
and that is this account from majorino who we know a little bit more about now

874
01:35:55.04 --> 01:35:55.36
but

875
01:35:55.36 --> 01:36:03.84
I think that the way he wraps it up and they actually did a massive trial

876
01:36:05.04 --> 01:36:10.80
a big trial for Reno and they found that the actions that he took were not negligent

877
01:36:10.80 --> 01:36:15.44
he might have made some calls that might not have been the best tactical to call as if you look back

878
01:36:15.44 --> 01:36:26.000
on it but he was basically cleared of any wrongdoing clearly clearly I think it's pretty clear

879
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.24
that wind off things you know he broke and he lost control of his troops and then

880
01:36:32.24 --> 01:36:38.000
banteen kind of took over and got things squared away okay clearly clearly wind off was also a

881
01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:43.12
huge fan of banteen so he might be spending that story a little bit in that direction but

882
01:36:43.12 --> 01:36:49.20
I do think that Reno I think that him looking back on the incident and he kind of wraps up

883
01:36:50.88 --> 01:36:57.36
his assessment of what happened and what went wrong that day and also I think for lack of a better word

884
01:36:59.20 --> 01:37:07.76
that there is a there's a warning of sorts in this so here's Reno

885
01:37:07.76 --> 01:37:15.60
after much reflection I've concluded that several great blunders were the direct causes

886
01:37:15.60 --> 01:37:22.80
of the custer massacre it is an established fact that custer disobeyed the orders of the general

887
01:37:22.80 --> 01:37:28.32
in command of the expedition for instead of waiting to meet general given in general Terry on June 26

888
01:37:28.32 --> 01:37:33.04
at the rosebud and then cooperate with them and their concerted plan of action as he had been

889
01:37:33.04 --> 01:37:38.16
directed as soon as he struck the trail of the Indians he followed it until he came upon the

890
01:37:38.16 --> 01:37:45.84
Indian village June 25th then without attempting to communicate with either Terry or given

891
01:37:45.84 --> 01:37:51.52
and without taking the trouble to ascertain the strength or positions of the Indians he divided

892
01:37:51.52 --> 01:37:58.40
his regiment into three separate battalions an act which nothing can justify and dashed against the

893
01:37:58.40 --> 01:38:06.72
Indians thus recklessly driving his own and my commands into an ambuscade of five thousand soon.

894
01:38:08.72 --> 01:38:15.68
Nor did custer take into consideration the unfed and exhausted conditions of the men and his

895
01:38:15.68 --> 01:38:24.32
horses and he entirely ignored the fact that the Indians were key Viva and ready for the attack at noon

896
01:38:24.32 --> 01:38:28.72
whereas it would have been an easy matter to surprise them very early in the morning.

897
01:38:30.08 --> 01:38:36.96
The only explanation for such conduct on the part of so brilliant an officer as custer undoubtedly

898
01:38:36.96 --> 01:38:47.84
was otherwise was his great personal ambition. He had fought himself partially disgraced because

899
01:38:47.84 --> 01:38:54.000
he had been superseded in command of the expedition by general Terry and it was well-known that he was

900
01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:02.08
resolved if possible to carry off all the honors of the campaign for being in command of the

901
01:39:02.08 --> 01:39:07.20
only cavalry regiment attached the expedition he knew the brunt to the fighting would necessarily

902
01:39:07.20 --> 01:39:13.84
fall on him and he made it no secret of his intention to cut loose from Terry where there was

903
01:39:13.84 --> 01:39:20.16
fighting to be due to be done and to carry on the campaign on his own hook.

904
01:39:20.16 --> 01:39:28.48
Absolutely insensible to fear he was so reckless and daring in the extreme and driven by an

905
01:39:28.48 --> 01:39:36.32
intense desire to distinguish himself by some brilliant exploit made his head long dash

906
01:39:37.60 --> 01:39:46.64
to a horrible death without the most causal regard for the maximums of military prudence.

907
01:39:46.64 --> 01:39:58.000
Even now after the lapse of nearly 10 years the horror of custer's battlefield is still vividly

908
01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:05.76
before me. The harrowing site of those mutilated and decomposing bodies crowning the heights on which

909
01:40:05.76 --> 01:40:17.28
poor custer fell will linger in my memory till death.

910
01:40:23.92 --> 01:40:33.52
And I think that's a pretty clear one. And of course there are military lessons to be learned

911
01:40:33.52 --> 01:40:40.16
from this account of the battle of little big horned maintain the element of surprise.

912
01:40:40.96 --> 01:40:47.36
Keep your forces unified as much as possible taken maintain the high ground.

913
01:40:48.96 --> 01:40:54.56
The rule we should always follow trust your reconnaissance units you've got them out there listen

914
01:40:54.56 --> 01:41:04.24
to them. Make sure your troops are rested and fed and have water. But beyond those

915
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:15.52
fundamental military tactical lessons I think it becomes quite clear that there is another

916
01:41:15.52 --> 01:41:30.24
enemy that we must always be on the watch for. Then that is ego. Our own ego. We have to keep our

917
01:41:30.24 --> 01:41:36.88
ego in check. You have to watch out for it. Guard against it getting control of you and interfering

918
01:41:36.88 --> 01:41:46.56
with your decision making process. Now I always say this. This doesn't mean that ego should be banished.

919
01:41:48.24 --> 01:41:56.08
It absolutely has a very positive side as well. It drives us to push hard. It drives us to do our best.

920
01:41:57.92 --> 01:42:05.84
And a guy like custer who personally led cavalry charges at the battle of Gettysburg

921
01:42:05.84 --> 01:42:13.68
that were critical in stopping flanking actions from Confederate troops and action that no doubt

922
01:42:13.68 --> 01:42:21.60
was fueled by courage and bravery. But also was fueled at some level.

923
01:42:26.40 --> 01:42:32.48
Because ego is a driver of our actions and sometimes it can be a positive driver of our actions.

924
01:42:32.48 --> 01:42:44.48
But it has to be balanced. It has to be balanced by humility and open ears and open mind.

925
01:42:44.48 --> 01:42:51.84
Keep the ego in check. I'll tell you something else. Like your ego,

926
01:42:51.84 --> 01:43:02.16
so another lesson from this is that you have to keep your emotions in check and you heard the brutality

927
01:43:03.52 --> 01:43:15.20
that was committed in these wars on both sides. Both sides. Anger and fear and frustration.

928
01:43:15.20 --> 01:43:28.000
And those result in escalation on both sides. And on both sides there were truly horrific acts

929
01:43:29.04 --> 01:43:39.52
of savagery. And that's an extreme example. This whole story is an extreme example of both those.

930
01:43:39.52 --> 01:43:49.60
Both the ego and the emotional mayhem that are shown in this example are very extreme.

931
01:43:49.60 --> 01:44:00.000
But also think about how they relate to your everyday life. How often do you let your ego

932
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:08.88
get in the way of making the right decision? How often do you let your emotions drive your decisions?

933
01:44:10.64 --> 01:44:19.28
How often do you go to war? Because of your emotions and because of your ego. How often

934
01:44:19.28 --> 01:44:25.36
do you go to war? Because of them. And what I'm saying is stop.

935
01:44:25.36 --> 01:44:35.92
Stop doing. Get control of your emotions and get control of your ego and put them in check.

936
01:44:35.92 --> 01:44:43.28
So you aren't escalating to situations where you savage your enemy or your friends or your

937
01:44:43.28 --> 01:44:48.96
coworkers or your peers or your family or whoever you do nothing in those situations to further

938
01:44:48.96 --> 01:44:58.24
your mission in life. But instead you just distract and detract from reaching your real goals.

939
01:45:01.76 --> 01:45:11.12
Don't let that happen. Learn, learn from this particular battle. See what the emotions and

940
01:45:11.12 --> 01:45:26.24
ego do and find a better way. Deescalate. The build coalitions with people instead of building

941
01:45:26.24 --> 01:45:37.52
bloodfumes. Work with people instead of working against people, lift people up instead of

942
01:45:37.52 --> 01:45:51.20
casting them down. And in short, what that is is leading. That is what true leadership is and

943
01:45:51.20 --> 01:46:13.36
that is what a true leader does. So go out there and do it. And I think that's all I've got for

944
01:46:13.36 --> 01:46:24.16
tonight. Just a brutal situation that this is. I actually pull up some other quotes too.

945
01:46:27.68 --> 01:46:30.32
Beginning the book, I talked about some of these massacres that were considered

946
01:46:31.60 --> 01:46:40.88
committed by the soldiers in some of these raids. And this is a one right here. John S. Smith

947
01:46:40.88 --> 01:46:46.40
from his congressional testimony. This is from the Sand Creek massacre. By the way, I saw the

948
01:46:46.40 --> 01:46:53.52
bodies of those lying there cut all the pieces. Worst mutilated than any I ever saw before the

949
01:46:53.52 --> 01:47:00.000
women cut to pieces with knives, scout their brains knocked out, children two or three months old.

950
01:47:00.96 --> 01:47:05.68
All ages lying there from sucking infants up to warriors.

951
01:47:05.68 --> 01:47:20.72
By whom were they mutilated? By United States troops. And again, this might my point in

952
01:47:20.72 --> 01:47:29.52
bringing that up is that it's the escalation of emotions and the escalation of ego. And I'm

953
01:47:29.52 --> 01:47:34.88
going to pay them back and we so often drive ourselves to these situations in everyday life.

954
01:47:34.88 --> 01:47:41.28
I mean, obviously not to this scale. But how do we overcome that? And I think you got to

955
01:47:41.28 --> 01:47:48.80
concentrate on keeping your ego and your emotions in check. Yeah. Yeah, and there's also that slippery

956
01:47:48.80 --> 01:47:58.72
slope factor where like remember the the one I think it was I think was me lie where we're talking

957
01:47:58.72 --> 01:48:03.28
about the slippery slope and kind of one thing leads to another where if you kind of look at the

958
01:48:03.28 --> 01:48:08.16
end the result you're like no way I would never do that. I would never be in that situation.

959
01:48:09.84 --> 01:48:15.92
But it starts like with one little thing. You know, so from one step to the to the next step or the

960
01:48:15.92 --> 01:48:20.000
for one little step where you slide or on the slippery slope it's like that's easy. You know where

961
01:48:21.04 --> 01:48:27.04
it's like all right one guy gets mad he slaps this guy, you know, or even I mean it goes really

962
01:48:27.04 --> 01:48:32.72
with anything with the slippery slope anything like cheating on your diet. I don't know it it does.

963
01:48:32.72 --> 01:48:38.08
And what we're really talking about is what's the cure to the slippery slope? It's the discipline.

964
01:48:38.08 --> 01:48:41.76
It's maintaining the discipline. It's maintaining the personal discipline. What you're talking about like

965
01:48:41.76 --> 01:48:46.000
I outs the slippery slope going down the donut slope. Yeah. Right. We don't want to do that.

966
01:48:46.64 --> 01:48:51.44
But on top of that you get into a leadership situation. Absolutely. It's a slippery slope.

967
01:48:51.44 --> 01:48:55.52
And you give that little bit you think, oh, you know, it's no big deal. I like that guy. Hey, he's

968
01:48:55.52 --> 01:49:01.12
going, he got a little angry. That's okay. But everybody else saw that happen. And now you're just

969
01:49:01.12 --> 01:49:06.40
allowing this to happen and it's only going to escalate. But it's so and think about this.

970
01:49:06.40 --> 01:49:11.28
Think about how easy it is to stop that one thing and say, hey, echo what are you doing? Come over here.

971
01:49:11.28 --> 01:49:15.84
Hey, look, we don't hit prisoners. Stop what you're doing. Yeah. Get it together. If you're mad,

972
01:49:15.84 --> 01:49:21.60
go over there, take a breath. Yeah. That's pretty easy for me to stop. Now what happens when you shoot

973
01:49:21.60 --> 01:49:25.76
somebody? Now we have, you know, we have a major incident. Now you're going to jail. I mean it's

974
01:49:25.76 --> 01:49:30.96
it's a totally different thing. I could have stopped that very easily in the beginning. Yeah.

975
01:49:30.96 --> 01:49:38.96
Or I can have major issues to deal with in the end. Yeah. Like this, I mean, this is more like the

976
01:49:38.96 --> 01:49:42.96
slippery slope situation, but not war and nothing like that. But you know how like, I don't know,

977
01:49:42.96 --> 01:49:50.000
financial guys, right? So there'll be like, hey, I'm going to do in investment. You know, you

978
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:54.64
hear about this where they'll be like, okay, I'm going to collect this money from my, my people,

979
01:49:54.64 --> 01:50:01.20
you know, my clients. And then I'm going to invest it, right? And then I'm just going to grab this

980
01:50:01.20 --> 01:50:05.20
little bit. I'll pay it right back. Oh, you know, next thing you know, you're going to level seven

981
01:50:05.20 --> 01:50:09.60
Ponzi. Yeah, this is that and that's the thing that's the slippery slope where when you start,

982
01:50:10.32 --> 01:50:15.28
even before you like start to slip or whatever, when you start, you think of, okay, where I'm right now.

983
01:50:15.28 --> 01:50:21.84
And going to prison for the Ponzi. Yeah, you never would. You're like, you know, I'm going to, you know,

984
01:50:21.84 --> 01:50:28.000
I've seen, I've never read, does that sounds like that would really be this psychology of people

985
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:33.28
that do that? Like, I better, well, I don't know because I have a specific example that you read

986
01:50:33.28 --> 01:50:37.68
about or something. No, no, I'm just kind of assuming that that's what the mindset is. Yeah, well,

987
01:50:38.40 --> 01:50:43.76
I had read about like the slippery slope situation, but it really, it's like two perspectives. One is

988
01:50:43.76 --> 01:50:50.48
like when you're in the mix and the the next step or down the slippery slope, the net is always

989
01:50:50.48 --> 01:50:55.04
a totally understandable. No, I'm just going to run, you know, sound the alarm. I mean, I bet if you

990
01:50:55.04 --> 01:51:00.88
looked at the Bernie made off where he had said that, you judge. Yeah. I would, I would have to read about it,

991
01:51:00.88 --> 01:51:05.28
but it would make sense to me that your assumption is correct that. In the beginning, he wasn't like,

992
01:51:05.28 --> 01:51:08.48
you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to rip off a bunch of people. Right. I bet in the beginning,

993
01:51:08.48 --> 01:51:11.92
he said, you know what? I got these good investments. I'm going to get these people to buy in.

994
01:51:11.92 --> 01:51:15.20
And then he goes, you know, and I didn't quite make what we were going to make, but I'm just going to

995
01:51:15.20 --> 01:51:20.56
go ahead and take some of these other people's money and just distribute it. Yeah. So everyone's kind of happy. Yeah.

996
01:51:20.56 --> 01:51:25.92
And you know, that's where it starts. Yeah. And then you then you realize you can get away with it and you go on

997
01:51:25.92 --> 01:51:31.92
down that road. Yeah. And that and that, that's let's ego, by the way, because that's that's just ego,

998
01:51:31.92 --> 01:51:35.52
because you're like, I don't want to admit to everybody that hey, I didn't make the money. I promised you.

999
01:51:35.52 --> 01:51:41.76
So you know what I'm going to do? Double down. Double down. Yeah. But the two perspectives is kind of the

1000
01:51:41.76 --> 01:51:48.32
the the thing where when you're in the mix, that one step is like that's hard to see it,

1001
01:51:48.32 --> 01:51:52.72
right, in a matter of speaking, it's hard to see. Because you're like, yeah, why should I, you know,

1002
01:51:52.72 --> 01:51:59.44
this guy came in 30 seconds like so what am I going to do? Repremand them in front of everyone. Come on.

1003
01:51:59.44 --> 01:52:05.44
You know, like really, you know, so no, you know, that's that's easy to understand. But every last

1004
01:52:05.44 --> 01:52:11.28
employee never coming in on time. You're like no way, impossible, no way. When I started this

1005
01:52:11.28 --> 01:52:15.84
come, no way, I would ever let that happen. But here's the thing, it will happen with that,

1006
01:52:15.84 --> 01:52:19.44
you know, because of that, because each little step is hard to see. You can't see it.

1007
01:52:20.64 --> 01:52:24.80
That's why it's like, this is the rule and straight up. So, you know, sticklers of, you know,

1008
01:52:24.80 --> 01:52:29.36
people like when they're sticklers, they're the rules. It's kind of like, I guess made me be like

1009
01:52:29.36 --> 01:52:34.72
socially the norm is like, hey, it's a stickler's of tight-wad, whatever, you know, but I will say this

1010
01:52:34.72 --> 01:52:40.000
value to that. There's also the way to lead like when you heard about Benteen,

1011
01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Benteen wouldn't have called the guy out like that, but he would have just given him a look.

1012
01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.36
Right, right. Don't you think it's a good idea? Don't you think it's really important that we

1013
01:52:47.36 --> 01:52:50.72
are on time? Yeah, yeah. You know, we're going to call them out in front of everybody,

1014
01:52:50.72 --> 01:52:54.72
right? Yeah. But he still would have been a leader. He's still would have led. And that's, that's

1015
01:52:54.72 --> 01:53:00.48
the, that's what we want to do. Yeah. Yeah. So, I guess we'll, uh,

1016
01:53:01.92 --> 01:53:05.60
yeah, save the questions from the interweb for next time.

1017
01:53:05.60 --> 01:53:12.56
Hey, Native American names are the coolest. They do have the coolest names. Yeah. But if, if,

1018
01:53:12.56 --> 01:53:17.68
if I had another son, I think I'd name him Bloody knife. Yeah. Right. Or what was the other one?

1019
01:53:17.68 --> 01:53:23.68
And the fans, one stab. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Native Americans definitely knew how to put

1020
01:53:23.68 --> 01:53:29.12
their names together. So what you like, what's the formula? It's like, oh, it's some significant

1021
01:53:29.12 --> 01:53:32.96
thing that this guy's in and we'll just call him. Well, you remember, wooden leg, because his name

1022
01:53:32.96 --> 01:53:38.16
was eats from the hand. And then they changed it from eats, I think it was eats from his hand

1023
01:53:38.16 --> 01:53:44.64
or eats from the hand. Once he proved that he was actually a badass warrior, his dad's, because he

1024
01:53:44.64 --> 01:53:48.64
had, he had requested the name from putting the right to the uncle. From a uncle, because they could

1025
01:53:48.64 --> 01:53:54.16
both, they could both walk, they could both walk the distance long and then we could up. And so

1026
01:53:54.16 --> 01:53:59.92
he requested that name. And when he once they found it to be a little big horn, he introduced his son

1027
01:53:59.92 --> 01:54:09.20
as this is my son wouldn't lay. Yeah. Oh my, uh, Sarah before, um, they were like, hey, I wonder how

1028
01:54:09.20 --> 01:54:13.84
the Native Americans get their name. I know how they just, when they do something significant,

1029
01:54:13.84 --> 01:54:17.52
they just, they just give it to them. They don't make up the names or anything. That's their

1030
01:54:17.52 --> 01:54:24.72
name what they do. So her friend Abby, she smoked a lot at the time. So her name was Abby Smokes a lot.

1031
01:54:24.72 --> 01:54:29.76
The, the, the, the, the, the legitimately? No. No, no, that's her Native American name.

1032
01:54:29.76 --> 01:54:34.08
But but in the warrior culture, it's way cooler. You know what I mean? Yeah.

1033
01:54:34.96 --> 01:54:38.88
I like dances with wolves, but I mean, and that's probably not warrior culture.

1034
01:54:40.56 --> 01:54:44.32
Yeah, you see no move. I haven't seen that movie. There's a long time ago,

1035
01:54:44.32 --> 01:54:48.32
there you go. That was when I went still went to movies before I just found them all kind of lame.

1036
01:54:48.32 --> 01:54:51.32
It's so super cute.

1037
01:54:51.32 --> 01:54:52.32
Yeah.

1038
01:54:52.32 --> 01:54:53.32
All right.

1039
01:54:53.32 --> 01:55:05.32
Well, I guess with that, how about you talk about how we can get in the game?

1040
01:55:05.32 --> 01:55:06.32
Getting the game there.

1041
01:55:06.32 --> 01:55:11.32
And little support, the podcast, maybe, would be nice to learn how to force that.

1042
01:55:11.32 --> 01:55:13.32
If you want to support the podcast, you can do it.

1043
01:55:13.32 --> 01:55:14.32
Yeah.

1044
01:55:14.32 --> 01:55:15.32
And this is how.

1045
01:55:15.32 --> 01:55:16.32
Yeah.

1046
01:55:16.32 --> 01:55:26.32
If you don't know already, I would say with supporting this podcast support yourself.

1047
01:55:26.32 --> 01:55:31.32
That's, I think that because if you're incapable, how or, you know, if you're not capable of supporting yourself,

1048
01:55:31.32 --> 01:55:32.32
how can you support podcast?

1049
01:55:32.32 --> 01:55:33.32
That's what can you support us.

1050
01:55:33.32 --> 01:55:34.32
That's right.

1051
01:55:34.32 --> 01:55:35.32
So I'll just do that.

1052
01:55:35.32 --> 01:55:36.32
And yeah.

1053
01:55:36.32 --> 01:55:38.32
By the way, we got mixed reviews from the last podcast.

1054
01:55:38.32 --> 01:55:42.32
I had said something along the lines of, hey, does this take too long?

1055
01:55:42.32 --> 01:55:44.32
Actually, we didn't get mixed reviews.

1056
01:55:44.32 --> 01:55:47.32
I think the only reviews we got were positive.

1057
01:55:47.32 --> 01:55:48.32
Yeah.

1058
01:55:48.32 --> 01:55:51.32
Now there might be some people that just didn't say anything because they were trying to be kind and gentle.

1059
01:55:51.32 --> 01:55:52.32
Yeah.

1060
01:55:52.32 --> 01:55:53.32
So that's fine.

1061
01:55:53.32 --> 01:55:54.32
They press stop right now.

1062
01:55:54.32 --> 01:55:59.32
The rest of the people that are kind of like the little deep in the game.

1063
01:55:59.32 --> 01:56:00.32
They're deep in the game.

1064
01:56:00.32 --> 01:56:01.32
Yeah.

1065
01:56:01.32 --> 01:56:06.32
And that's a good, well, in a way, and there were some good points that they brought up because

1066
01:56:06.32 --> 01:56:11.32
I forget he said it, but they were like, there's some nuggets in there.

1067
01:56:11.32 --> 01:56:12.32
Yeah.

1068
01:56:12.32 --> 01:56:15.32
We don't stop trying to learn.

1069
01:56:15.32 --> 01:56:16.32
Yeah.

1070
01:56:16.32 --> 01:56:19.32
While we're talking about things that help us, right?

1071
01:56:19.32 --> 01:56:20.32
Correct.

1072
01:56:20.32 --> 01:56:21.32
We're still trying to figure some stuff out.

1073
01:56:21.32 --> 01:56:22.32
Yeah.

1074
01:56:22.32 --> 01:56:26.32
There's some nuggets of information there that might be dropped at any time.

1075
01:56:26.32 --> 01:56:27.32
Yeah.

1076
01:56:27.32 --> 01:56:34.32
And even if not, that's part of the reason why I put the guide, you know, on YouTube.

1077
01:56:34.32 --> 01:56:35.32
Oh, yeah.

1078
01:56:35.32 --> 01:56:36.32
Yeah.

1079
01:56:36.32 --> 01:56:36.32
So you know, there's got, yeah.

1080
01:56:36.32 --> 01:56:37.32
This is the guys are talking about this stuff.

1081
01:56:37.32 --> 01:56:38.32
So it's turned it off.

1082
01:56:38.32 --> 01:56:41.32
It looks like, oh, whatever, the internet stuff.

1083
01:56:41.32 --> 01:56:42.32
I'll just skip that part.

1084
01:56:42.32 --> 01:56:43.32
Yeah.

1085
01:56:43.32 --> 01:56:45.32
You can skip it and I'll tell you where to skip to.

1086
01:56:45.32 --> 01:56:47.32
So both options are there.

1087
01:56:47.32 --> 01:56:48.32
Yeah.

1088
01:56:48.32 --> 01:56:49.32
Yeah.

1089
01:56:49.32 --> 01:56:52.32
Because some people might just want to take everything they can from the podcast.

1090
01:56:52.32 --> 01:56:56.32
That's why I put, you know, the timestamp for all the subjects.

1091
01:56:56.32 --> 01:56:57.32
Yeah.

1092
01:56:57.32 --> 01:57:05.32
Because, you know, you look, I like to assume that every 100% of the people, everybody,

1093
01:57:05.32 --> 01:57:09.32
10 out of 10.

1094
01:57:09.32 --> 01:57:11.32
Like every single word of that.

1095
01:57:11.32 --> 01:57:15.32
And they like every single subject and they like, I like, I like to think that.

1096
01:57:15.32 --> 01:57:20.32
But in the event of that not being in the case, I don't want them to be all this while I got to sit through.

1097
01:57:20.32 --> 01:57:25.32
Echo talking about, you know, Amazon click throughs and on it, you know, so they have the option.

1098
01:57:25.32 --> 01:57:26.32
I think that's important.

1099
01:57:26.32 --> 01:57:27.32
Yeah.

1100
01:57:27.32 --> 01:57:28.32
We're working together.

1101
01:57:28.32 --> 01:57:30.32
I feel like we're all in this together, you know.

1102
01:57:30.32 --> 01:57:33.32
We don't need the one guy being, hey, I have a different opinion than you.

1103
01:57:33.32 --> 01:57:34.32
I have that right.

1104
01:57:34.32 --> 01:57:36.32
And then now I got to sit through the stuff that you guys like.

1105
01:57:36.32 --> 01:57:37.32
Yeah.

1106
01:57:37.32 --> 01:57:40.32
And then I think we're taking care of both sides of it.

1107
01:57:40.32 --> 01:57:41.32
Sure.

1108
01:57:41.32 --> 01:57:45.32
So, and to do that, you know, of course, like I said, you support yourself supplementation.

1109
01:57:45.32 --> 01:57:49.32
If you're into it, and here's the thing where I didn't think that like,

1110
01:57:49.32 --> 01:57:51.32
Krill oil was supplementation.

1111
01:57:51.32 --> 01:57:52.32
Who's the thing it is?

1112
01:57:52.32 --> 01:57:53.32
And it helps.

1113
01:57:53.32 --> 01:57:56.32
Because that's because you're now on the crime on the Krill oil.

1114
01:57:56.32 --> 01:57:58.32
And it's, and I've reaped its benefits.

1115
01:57:58.32 --> 01:58:02.32
And my, my wife's dad was talking about Krill oil from, oh,

1116
01:58:02.32 --> 01:58:04.32
Fish oil, no, not fish oil.

1117
01:58:04.32 --> 01:58:05.32
Fish oil is good.

1118
01:58:05.32 --> 01:58:06.32
Don't get it wrong.

1119
01:58:06.32 --> 01:58:07.32
Just standing.

1120
01:58:07.32 --> 01:58:08.32
Just, you know what's better?

1121
01:58:08.32 --> 01:58:09.32
Krill oil.

1122
01:58:09.32 --> 01:58:10.32
This is what he would sell.

1123
01:58:10.32 --> 01:58:16.32
I'm like, yeah, yeah, he's kind of, you know, one of these health, like guys.

1124
01:58:16.32 --> 01:58:19.32
And, um, the omeas it turns out that he always looks right.

1125
01:58:19.32 --> 01:58:20.32
Yeah.

1126
01:58:20.32 --> 01:58:23.32
So, um, yeah, Krill oil from, from on it, of course, that's the main one.

1127
01:58:23.32 --> 01:58:26.32
They have like the quality, the quality stuff.

1128
01:58:26.32 --> 01:58:32.32
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, and he, one might think, oh, yeah, of course.

1129
01:58:32.32 --> 01:58:35.32
I'm not going to go get the cheap stuff like what, but here's the thing.

1130
01:58:35.32 --> 01:58:37.32
With supplements, like there is cheap stuff.

1131
01:58:37.32 --> 01:58:39.32
There's like stuff that straight up doesn't work.

1132
01:58:39.32 --> 01:58:43.32
Like you might as well be taking like chalk condensed into pill.

1133
01:58:43.32 --> 01:58:44.32
It's true.

1134
01:58:44.32 --> 01:58:45.32
Absolutely true.

1135
01:58:45.32 --> 01:58:46.32
chalk, you said.

1136
01:58:46.32 --> 01:58:47.32
Yeah.

1137
01:58:47.32 --> 01:58:48.32
Okay.

1138
01:58:48.32 --> 01:58:48.32
Don't do that.

1139
01:58:48.32 --> 01:58:51.32
Because it's not like, I don't know, something about it being a supplement.

1140
01:58:51.32 --> 01:58:52.32
It's not rig, I don't know, something.

1141
01:58:52.32 --> 01:58:56.32
But on it is all legit, like it has the literature, all that stuff like where they get it.

1142
01:58:56.32 --> 01:59:01.32
Even the Krill oil is like, you're so excited about where the Krill oil comes from.

1143
01:59:01.32 --> 01:59:02.32
Always.

1144
01:59:02.32 --> 01:59:03.32
That's the deal.

1145
01:59:03.32 --> 01:59:04.32
Like I said, we're all, because you're about to,

1146
01:59:04.32 --> 01:59:05.32
Yeah, that's it.

1147
01:59:05.32 --> 01:59:06.32
You're about to tell us about the environment.

1148
01:59:06.32 --> 01:59:07.32
Go for any ships.

1149
01:59:07.32 --> 01:59:08.32
Yep.

1150
01:59:08.32 --> 01:59:09.32
That's what you love that.

1151
01:59:09.32 --> 01:59:11.32
That was kind of a cool video too.

1152
01:59:11.32 --> 01:59:12.32
Yeah.

1153
01:59:12.32 --> 01:59:13.32
No, I like that.

1154
01:59:13.32 --> 01:59:14.32
Obviously, we left an impression on you.

1155
01:59:14.32 --> 01:59:17.32
And for you to say something's cool video, that's a pretty good combo.

1156
01:59:17.32 --> 01:59:18.32
That means like, yeah.

1157
01:59:18.32 --> 01:59:20.32
You kind of like cool videos and make them.

1158
01:59:20.32 --> 01:59:22.32
At least we hope that you make them.

1159
01:59:22.32 --> 01:59:24.32
I tell myself, yeah, sure.

1160
01:59:24.32 --> 01:59:26.32
Because a lot of times if we don't make them, you don't make them.

1161
01:59:26.32 --> 01:59:28.32
Don't know if you make one every three months.

1162
01:59:28.32 --> 01:59:30.32
Then how do we feel about that?

1163
01:59:30.32 --> 01:59:31.32
They're all I got to.

1164
01:59:31.32 --> 01:59:32.32
We don't feel really good about it.

1165
01:59:32.32 --> 01:59:33.32
Yeah.

1166
01:59:33.32 --> 01:59:34.32
There you go.

1167
01:59:34.32 --> 01:59:38.32
I mean, okay, you know, I take your point fully.

1168
01:59:38.32 --> 01:59:40.32
But back to the krill oil.

1169
01:59:40.32 --> 01:59:41.32
It's good.

1170
01:59:41.32 --> 01:59:42.32
Anyway, what else?

1171
01:59:42.32 --> 01:59:47.32
The krill oil, worry bars, the true tech for performance.

1172
01:59:47.32 --> 01:59:52.32
You know, if you, if you want the edge, that sounds like kind of commercially, but for real.

1173
01:59:52.32 --> 01:59:55.32
If you want the edge, if you want to get the edge.

1174
01:59:55.32 --> 01:59:57.32
If you want, you can now for brain too.

1175
01:59:57.32 --> 02:00:00.32
Alpha brain gets like a lot of mental edge.

1176
02:00:00.32 --> 02:00:03.32
You know what? And you can get 10% off of getting support. You're all it.

1177
02:00:03.32 --> 02:00:05.32
Which is good too.

1178
02:00:05.32 --> 02:00:07.32
Go to on it.com slash.

1179
02:00:07.32 --> 02:00:09.32
Jacko.

1180
02:00:09.32 --> 02:00:12.32
Also, cool way. Good way.

1181
02:00:12.32 --> 02:00:14.32
Legit way doesn't cost you anything.

1182
02:00:14.32 --> 02:00:16.32
Way to support this podcast.

1183
02:00:16.32 --> 02:00:20.32
Reinforces podcast and be in the game.

1184
02:00:20.32 --> 02:00:21.32
Let's face it.

1185
02:00:21.32 --> 02:00:23.32
Much better to be in the game.

1186
02:00:23.32 --> 02:00:24.32
And here I was this.

1187
02:00:24.32 --> 02:00:26.32
And this is on a side note from this.

1188
02:00:26.32 --> 02:00:31.32
So, you know, like, you know, like, people will go to like,

1189
02:00:31.32 --> 02:00:33.32
a motivational seminar or something.

1190
02:00:33.32 --> 02:00:37.32
You know, like this or or listen to a motivational speech.

1191
02:00:37.32 --> 02:00:40.32
My motivational seminar would be three minutes long.

1192
02:00:40.32 --> 02:00:41.32
Yeah.

1193
02:00:41.32 --> 02:00:45.32
So, there's this, like party brain where, you know,

1194
02:00:45.32 --> 02:00:47.32
it's seek something and then you get to pay off.

1195
02:00:47.32 --> 02:00:50.32
And then it's it's basically a sense of satisfaction.

1196
02:00:50.32 --> 02:00:51.32
So you could seek no more.

1197
02:00:51.32 --> 02:00:53.32
So you're, you're satisfied.

1198
02:00:53.32 --> 02:00:56.32
So people seeking inspiration and motivation.

1199
02:00:56.32 --> 02:01:00.32
They'll go and they'll go to a speech or a seminar or something like this.

1200
02:01:00.32 --> 02:01:06.32
And they'll consume the speech or the motivational video or whatever.

1201
02:01:06.32 --> 02:01:07.32
But they're specating.

1202
02:01:07.32 --> 02:01:08.32
There, yeah, they're watching it.

1203
02:01:08.32 --> 02:01:09.32
There's spectating.

1204
02:01:09.32 --> 02:01:10.32
Yeah, the speech.

1205
02:01:10.32 --> 02:01:11.32
Sure. Yeah. So the whole thing.

1206
02:01:11.32 --> 02:01:12.32
That's a lot different.

1207
02:01:12.32 --> 02:01:13.32
Really the big picture should be.

1208
02:01:13.32 --> 02:01:15.32
I'm going to get see this speech.

1209
02:01:15.32 --> 02:01:16.32
Motivation video.

1210
02:01:16.32 --> 02:01:17.32
Whatever.

1211
02:01:17.32 --> 02:01:18.32
I'm going to be inspired.

1212
02:01:18.32 --> 02:01:18.32
Motivate.

1213
02:01:18.32 --> 02:01:19.32
Now I'm going to go take action.

1214
02:01:19.32 --> 02:01:20.32
Right.

1215
02:01:20.32 --> 02:01:23.32
But to take action, you still have to have a need, you know,

1216
02:01:23.32 --> 02:01:24.32
that needs to be satisfied.

1217
02:01:24.32 --> 02:01:28.32
But people, they'll, they'll view or, or whatever.

1218
02:01:28.32 --> 02:01:31.32
Consumant the speech.

1219
02:01:31.32 --> 02:01:35.32
And they will be satisfied because they see the speech.

1220
02:01:35.32 --> 02:01:37.32
And they don't take action.

1221
02:01:37.32 --> 02:01:38.32
And here's the thing.

1222
02:01:38.32 --> 02:01:42.32
The next speech that comes in the town or the next motivational video on YouTube.

1223
02:01:42.32 --> 02:01:43.32
You know, it is the next one.

1224
02:01:43.32 --> 02:01:43.32
Yeah.

1225
02:01:43.32 --> 02:01:45.32
Or the next time whoever the person is,

1226
02:01:45.32 --> 02:01:47.32
I don't know, Tony Robbins or whoever.

1227
02:01:47.32 --> 02:01:49.32
Next time they're coming to town,

1228
02:01:49.32 --> 02:01:52.32
they're going to go for that good stuff that they got last time.

1229
02:01:52.32 --> 02:01:54.32
They left real satisfied with, you know,

1230
02:01:54.32 --> 02:01:57.32
you see hearing that, you know, viewing that speech.

1231
02:01:57.32 --> 02:01:58.32
They go, they do it again.

1232
02:01:58.32 --> 02:01:59.32
They get that sense satisfaction.

1233
02:01:59.32 --> 02:02:01.32
Still taking no action, by the way.

1234
02:02:01.32 --> 02:02:02.32
Not good.

1235
02:02:02.32 --> 02:02:03.32
So it's like it's a weird.

1236
02:02:03.32 --> 02:02:04.32
It's a messed up cycle.

1237
02:02:04.32 --> 02:02:05.32
Well, I think the big difference there is,

1238
02:02:05.32 --> 02:02:07.32
and that's, is that those,

1239
02:02:07.32 --> 02:02:09.32
literally you're watching.

1240
02:02:09.32 --> 02:02:10.32
Yeah.

1241
02:02:10.32 --> 02:02:11.32
And you're spectating.

1242
02:02:11.32 --> 02:02:11.32
Yeah.

1243
02:02:11.32 --> 02:02:14.32
As opposed to getting in the game.

1244
02:02:14.32 --> 02:02:15.32
Yeah.

1245
02:02:15.32 --> 02:02:16.32
And see.

1246
02:02:16.32 --> 02:02:18.32
That's my, that was really my whole point where

1247
02:02:18.32 --> 02:02:21.32
you know, I'm going to listen to you.

1248
02:02:21.32 --> 02:02:23.32
You're not saying like,

1249
02:02:23.32 --> 02:02:24.32
I mean, you are saying get after,

1250
02:02:24.32 --> 02:02:26.32
but you're not saying you can do it.

1251
02:02:26.32 --> 02:02:28.32
You're not saying that kind of stuff, you know?

1252
02:02:28.32 --> 02:02:29.32
Like, and I know it goes,

1253
02:02:29.32 --> 02:02:32.32
I'm actually, I'm actually not saying you can do it.

1254
02:02:32.32 --> 02:02:34.32
I'm actually saying do it.

1255
02:02:34.32 --> 02:02:34.32
Do it.

1256
02:02:34.32 --> 02:02:34.32
Yeah.

1257
02:02:34.32 --> 02:02:35.32
Exactly right.

1258
02:02:35.32 --> 02:02:36.32
But that's the thing.

1259
02:02:36.32 --> 02:02:38.32
So really the whole message,

1260
02:02:38.32 --> 02:02:40.32
whatever it may be, you know,

1261
02:02:40.32 --> 02:02:41.32
I don't know, big, don't know,

1262
02:02:41.32 --> 02:02:43.32
that's all this stuff is.

1263
02:02:43.32 --> 02:02:44.32
The big messages don't eat donuts.

1264
02:02:44.32 --> 02:02:46.32
I think, I don't know, right?

1265
02:02:46.32 --> 02:02:48.32
I don't know, but there's a bunch of messages.

1266
02:02:48.32 --> 02:02:50.32
But the key there to them,

1267
02:02:50.32 --> 02:02:52.32
the whole message is you got to do it.

1268
02:02:52.32 --> 02:02:52.32
Yeah.

1269
02:02:52.32 --> 02:02:54.32
It's not like you can do it.

1270
02:02:54.32 --> 02:02:55.32
You know, you're like,

1271
02:02:55.32 --> 02:02:56.32
I can do it.

1272
02:02:56.32 --> 02:02:57.32
I feel good about that.

1273
02:02:57.32 --> 02:02:58.32
I'm good.

1274
02:02:58.32 --> 02:02:59.32
But this is like,

1275
02:02:59.32 --> 02:03:01.32
you got to do, you got to go out and do that.

1276
02:03:01.32 --> 02:03:03.32
You know, you can't just watch.

1277
02:03:03.32 --> 02:03:04.32
Okay.

1278
02:03:04.32 --> 02:03:05.32
I think I'm convinced.

1279
02:03:05.32 --> 02:03:06.32
You know, I'm ready to get the game.

1280
02:03:06.32 --> 02:03:08.32
I'm saying that's the difference.

1281
02:03:08.32 --> 02:03:10.32
And so you're saying that Amazon,

1282
02:03:10.32 --> 02:03:11.32
the free DM is on shopping,

1283
02:03:11.32 --> 02:03:13.32
click through the website.

1284
02:03:13.32 --> 02:03:14.32
Jocobacast.com.

1285
02:03:14.32 --> 02:03:15.32
Little Amazon link.

1286
02:03:15.32 --> 02:03:16.32
It definitely helps.

1287
02:03:16.32 --> 02:03:17.32
And also,

1288
02:03:17.32 --> 02:03:22.32
we're all going to be all up on Amazon for Christmas.

1289
02:03:22.32 --> 02:03:23.32
Yeah.

1290
02:03:23.32 --> 02:03:24.32
For the holiday season.

1291
02:03:24.32 --> 02:03:25.32
For whatever it is,

1292
02:03:25.32 --> 02:03:27.32
you're going to celebrate when school's off for two weeks.

1293
02:03:27.32 --> 02:03:29.32
And you got to buy a bunch of people present.

1294
02:03:29.32 --> 02:03:30.32
Yeah.

1295
02:03:30.32 --> 02:03:31.32
During that time period,

1296
02:03:31.32 --> 02:03:33.32
that's a good time to support the podcast.

1297
02:03:33.32 --> 02:03:34.32
Doesn't cost you anything.

1298
02:03:34.32 --> 02:03:35.32
You click through Amazon.

1299
02:03:35.32 --> 02:03:37.32
And you make your purchases.

1300
02:03:37.32 --> 02:03:39.32
The key there is to remember it.

1301
02:03:39.32 --> 02:03:40.32
Like you need some kind of cue.

1302
02:03:40.32 --> 02:03:41.32
Put in your bookmarks.

1303
02:03:41.32 --> 02:03:42.32
I'm going to leave that.

1304
02:03:42.32 --> 02:03:43.32
Some kind of cue.

1305
02:03:43.32 --> 02:03:44.32
That's good.

1306
02:03:44.32 --> 02:03:45.32
That's the key right there.

1307
02:03:45.32 --> 02:03:47.32
I think the rest is just,

1308
02:03:47.32 --> 02:03:49.32
it just kind of takes care of itself.

1309
02:03:49.32 --> 02:03:50.32
Anyway,

1310
02:03:50.32 --> 02:03:51.32

Yeah.

1322
02:04:07.32 --> 02:04:08.32
Yeah.

1323
02:04:08.32 --> 02:04:09.32
Those are good men.

1324
02:04:09.32 --> 02:04:10.32
They're reviews.

1325
02:04:10.32 --> 02:04:11.32
Yeah.

1326
02:04:11.32 --> 02:04:12.32
Those are solid.

1327
02:04:12.32 --> 02:04:14.32
Creative.

1328
02:04:14.32 --> 02:04:15.32
I encourage that.

1329
02:04:15.32 --> 02:04:17.32
I'm not sure.

1330
02:04:17.32 --> 02:04:19.32
And then of course,

1331
02:04:19.32 --> 02:04:20.32
of course,

1332
02:04:20.32 --> 02:04:20.32
look,

1333
02:04:20.32 --> 02:04:21.32
if you were T-shirts,

1334
02:04:21.32 --> 02:04:23.32
if you were hoodies,

1335
02:04:23.32 --> 02:04:26.32
drink coffee or

1336
02:04:26.32 --> 02:04:29.32
tea of any kind.

1337
02:04:29.32 --> 02:04:31.32
Or white tea.

1338
02:04:31.32 --> 02:04:32.32
Anyway,

1339
02:04:32.32 --> 02:04:33.32
jockels.com,

1340
02:04:33.32 --> 02:04:35.32
making my some cool shirts.

1341
02:04:35.32 --> 02:04:36.32
If you think they're cool,

1342
02:04:36.32 --> 02:04:38.32
look at them.

1343
02:04:38.32 --> 02:04:41.32
There's going to be more to them than meets the eye.

1344
02:04:41.32 --> 02:04:42.32
Just looking at them.

1345
02:04:42.32 --> 02:04:44.32
But if you like how they look,

1346
02:04:44.32 --> 02:04:45.32
maybe look into them.

1347
02:04:45.32 --> 02:04:47.32
But here's the thing,

1348
02:04:47.32 --> 02:04:47.32
no,

1349
02:04:47.32 --> 02:04:48.32
you know,

1350
02:04:48.32 --> 02:04:49.32
making like a so mysterious,

1351
02:04:49.32 --> 02:04:49.32
like,

1352
02:04:49.32 --> 02:04:49.32
oh,

1353
02:04:49.32 --> 02:04:50.32
there's all these layers.

1354
02:04:50.32 --> 02:04:51.32
How I always say,

1355
02:04:51.32 --> 02:04:51.32
yeah.

1356
02:04:51.32 --> 02:04:52.32
Then the hoodie.

1357
02:04:52.32 --> 02:04:54.32
Once I just discipline

1358
02:04:54.32 --> 02:04:55.32
other sizes,

1359
02:04:55.32 --> 02:04:56.32
freedom.

1360
02:04:56.32 --> 02:04:56.32
If you look,

1361
02:04:56.32 --> 02:04:57.32
be pay attention.

1362
02:04:57.32 --> 02:04:58.32
That's a little equal sign.

1363
02:04:58.32 --> 02:04:59.32
Yeah.

1364
02:04:59.32 --> 02:05:00.32
And it's a barcode.

1365
02:05:00.32 --> 02:05:01.32
Yep.

1366
02:05:01.32 --> 02:05:02.32
That's made into equal sign.

1367
02:05:02.32 --> 02:05:03.32
Someone hit me on Twitter,

1368
02:05:03.32 --> 02:05:03.32
said,

1369
02:05:03.32 --> 02:05:04.32
hey,

1370
02:05:04.32 --> 02:05:05.32
you're talking about the layers.

1371
02:05:05.32 --> 02:05:07.32
Is this equal sign a layer?

1372
02:05:07.32 --> 02:05:08.32
Yeah.

1373
02:05:08.32 --> 02:05:08.32
Yeah.

1374
02:05:08.32 --> 02:05:10.32
Like is this a little hidden thing?

1375
02:05:10.32 --> 02:05:11.32
Yeah.

1376
02:05:11.32 --> 02:05:12.32
It's not that big of a deal.

1377
02:05:12.32 --> 02:05:13.32
But it's small deal.

1378
02:05:13.32 --> 02:05:15.32
It's like a double like,

1379
02:05:15.32 --> 02:05:16.32
okay,

1380
02:05:16.32 --> 02:05:17.32
here it is.

1381
02:05:17.32 --> 02:05:19.32
So the font.

1382
02:05:19.32 --> 02:05:20.32
Right.

1383
02:05:20.32 --> 02:05:21.32
Yes.

1384
02:05:21.32 --> 02:05:22.32
Jockel chose the font.

1385
02:05:22.32 --> 02:05:23.32
Yes.

1386
02:05:23.32 --> 02:05:24.32
Before any of this thing started,

1387
02:05:24.32 --> 02:05:25.32
Jockel chose the font.

1388
02:05:25.32 --> 02:05:26.32
Yeah,

1389
02:05:26.32 --> 02:05:29.32
because I made the jockel podcast,

1390
02:05:29.32 --> 02:05:29.32
despite you being a massive,

1391
02:05:29.32 --> 02:05:30.32
you know,

1392
02:05:30.32 --> 02:05:31.32
skills with.

1393
02:05:31.32 --> 02:05:31.32
Yeah.

1394
02:05:31.32 --> 02:05:33.32
Because I made the

1395
02:05:33.32 --> 02:05:34.32
Jockel podcast,

1396
02:05:34.32 --> 02:05:37.32
despite you being a massive,

1397
02:05:37.32 --> 02:05:38.32
you know,

1398
02:05:38.32 --> 02:05:39.32
skills with.

1399
02:05:39.32 --> 02:05:42.32
All those programs that do all the design.

1400
02:05:42.32 --> 02:05:44.32
And you have a great graphics mind and all that stuff.

1401
02:05:44.32 --> 02:05:45.32
Despite all that,

1402
02:05:45.32 --> 02:05:46.32
I just made this little thing.

1403
02:05:46.32 --> 02:05:47.32
You know,

1404
02:05:47.32 --> 02:05:48.32
a little jockel podcast symbol.

1405
02:05:48.32 --> 02:05:50.32
And I made it on PowerPoint.

1406
02:05:50.32 --> 02:05:54.32
And when it came time to pick the font.

1407
02:05:54.32 --> 02:05:56.32
I chose.

1408
02:05:56.32 --> 02:05:59.32
This font called OCR.

1409
02:05:59.32 --> 02:06:00.32
You know,

1410
02:06:00.32 --> 02:06:01.32
optical,

1411
02:06:01.32 --> 02:06:03.32
something recognition.

1412
02:06:03.32 --> 02:06:03.32
Yeah.

1413
02:06:03.32 --> 02:06:05.32
Optical because for in my mind,

1414
02:06:05.32 --> 02:06:06.32
I'm always like,

1415
02:06:06.32 --> 02:06:06.32
okay,

1416
02:06:06.32 --> 02:06:07.32
part machine.

1417
02:06:07.32 --> 02:06:07.32
Right.

1418
02:06:07.32 --> 02:06:08.32
I'm part machine.

1419
02:06:08.32 --> 02:06:11.32
So this font can be read by machines.

1420
02:06:11.32 --> 02:06:12.32
Yep.

1421
02:06:12.32 --> 02:06:13.32
That is why original.

1422
02:06:13.32 --> 02:06:14.32
That is why I use this font.

1423
02:06:14.32 --> 02:06:15.32
Yeah.

1424
02:06:15.32 --> 02:06:16.32
So yeah, and you can look at it.

1425
02:06:16.32 --> 02:06:18.32
I don't know if you told me to look it up,

1426
02:06:18.32 --> 02:06:19.32
but you said it,

1427
02:06:19.32 --> 02:06:20.32
you're like, oh, yeah,

1428
02:06:20.32 --> 02:06:21.32
it's cool.

1429
02:06:21.32 --> 02:06:21.32
Oh, thanks.

1430
02:06:21.32 --> 02:06:22.32
I looked it up.

1431
02:06:22.32 --> 02:06:23.32
And yeah,

1432
02:06:23.32 --> 02:06:23.32
sure enough,

1433
02:06:23.32 --> 02:06:26.32
it's the first font that they made that computers can.

1434
02:06:26.32 --> 02:06:27.32
Yes, that's right.

1435
02:06:27.32 --> 02:06:28.32
That is what it is.

1436
02:06:28.32 --> 02:06:29.32
That's why I chose it.

1437
02:06:29.32 --> 02:06:30.32
Oh, my God.

1438
02:06:30.32 --> 02:06:31.32
It's guys deep.

1439
02:06:31.32 --> 02:06:32.32
Oh, my.

1440
02:06:32.32 --> 02:06:33.32
All right.

1441
02:06:33.32 --> 02:06:35.32
So the barcode.

1442
02:06:35.32 --> 02:06:37.32
Is just something else.

1443
02:06:37.32 --> 02:06:40.32
Another thing like the computer is going to be reading your shirt kind of thing.

1444
02:06:40.32 --> 02:06:41.32
You're a machine.

1445
02:06:41.32 --> 02:06:42.32
Yeah.

1446
02:06:42.32 --> 02:06:43.32
Well, you're wearing them.

1447
02:06:43.32 --> 02:06:44.32
You're a machine readable.

1448
02:06:44.32 --> 02:06:45.32
You're a machine.

1449
02:06:45.32 --> 02:06:46.32
Yes, yes, you're wearing it.

1450
02:06:46.32 --> 02:06:47.32
That's what it is.

1451
02:06:47.32 --> 02:06:49.32
You can't get right back from your.

1452
02:06:49.32 --> 02:06:50.32
So that's kind of the little,

1453
02:06:50.32 --> 02:06:50.32
I mean,

1454
02:06:50.32 --> 02:06:52.32
that's just more like a fun thing for sure.

1455
02:06:52.32 --> 02:06:53.32
Small life.

1456
02:06:53.32 --> 02:06:54.32
But anyway,

1457
02:06:54.32 --> 02:06:55.32
again,

1458
02:06:55.32 --> 02:06:57.32
jockel store that's where all the stuff is.

1459
02:06:57.32 --> 02:06:59.32
Cool rash guards that.

1460
02:06:59.32 --> 02:07:00.32
Hey, man,

1461
02:07:00.32 --> 02:07:02.32
we made the claim 19%.

1462
02:07:02.32 --> 02:07:03.32
Improvement.

1463
02:07:03.32 --> 02:07:04.32
Mm-hmm.

1464
02:07:04.32 --> 02:07:06.32
That is yet to be refuted so far.

1465
02:07:06.32 --> 02:07:07.32
You know,

1466
02:07:07.32 --> 02:07:08.32
as far as feedback that I've been getting.

1467
02:07:08.32 --> 02:07:09.32
Anyway,

1468
02:07:09.32 --> 02:07:11.32
if you want your improvement because you know what,

1469
02:07:11.32 --> 02:07:12.32
you know what, though,

1470
02:07:12.32 --> 02:07:14.32
I think that there is legitimacy.

1471
02:07:14.32 --> 02:07:15.32
I like actually,

1472
02:07:15.32 --> 02:07:18.32
somebody put an article on today about how it compresses the muscle

1473
02:07:18.32 --> 02:07:19.32
increase the circulation.

1474
02:07:19.32 --> 02:07:21.32
So you actually get the legit improvement.

1475
02:07:21.32 --> 02:07:23.32
I don't know all the science behind it.

1476
02:07:23.32 --> 02:07:23.32
You know,

1477
02:07:23.32 --> 02:07:24.32
but

1478
02:07:24.32 --> 02:07:25.32
bro science.

1479
02:07:25.32 --> 02:07:26.32
Yeah.

1480
02:07:26.32 --> 02:07:26.32
No,

1481
02:07:26.32 --> 02:07:27.32
but you know what is,

1482
02:07:27.32 --> 02:07:28.32
you're saying,

1483
02:07:28.32 --> 02:07:28.32
you know,

1484
02:07:28.32 --> 02:07:30.32
when you put on like,

1485
02:07:30.32 --> 02:07:31.32
a uniform.

1486
02:07:31.32 --> 02:07:32.32
Oh, yeah,

1487
02:07:32.32 --> 02:07:32.32
you,

1488
02:07:32.32 --> 02:07:33.32
or you get a little,

1489
02:07:33.32 --> 02:07:34.32
yeah.

1490
02:07:34.32 --> 02:07:35.32
Yeah.

1491
02:07:35.32 --> 02:07:36.32
This is a ritual back to the ritual

1492
02:07:36.32 --> 02:07:37.32
conversation.

1493
02:07:37.32 --> 02:07:38.32
Yeah.

1494
02:07:38.32 --> 02:07:38.32
Yeah.

1495
02:07:38.32 --> 02:07:38.32
Kind of,

1496
02:07:38.32 --> 02:07:39.32
and it's like,

1497
02:07:39.32 --> 02:07:40.32
it's weird.

1498
02:07:40.32 --> 02:07:40.32
Like,

1499
02:07:40.32 --> 02:07:42.32
when I was young when I played footballs 11,

1500
02:07:42.32 --> 02:07:43.32
you're old.

1501
02:07:43.32 --> 02:07:44.32
And we got new shoes.

1502
02:07:44.32 --> 02:07:45.32
Football seasons here.

1503
02:07:45.32 --> 02:07:46.32
New shoes.

1504
02:07:46.32 --> 02:07:47.32
I couldn't wait to go to practice.

1505
02:07:47.32 --> 02:07:48.32
I'm going to be faster.

1506
02:07:48.32 --> 02:07:49.32
Few months.

1507
02:07:49.32 --> 02:07:50.32
Man,

1508
02:07:50.32 --> 02:07:51.32
my shoes are dirty.

1509
02:07:51.32 --> 02:07:52.32
I hate practice,

1510
02:07:52.32 --> 02:07:53.32
but you get new shoes.

1511
02:07:53.32 --> 02:07:54.32
You want to go practice.

1512
02:07:54.32 --> 02:07:55.32
You get new workout gear.

1513
02:07:55.32 --> 02:07:56.32
You're like,

1514
02:07:56.32 --> 02:07:57.32
I'm going to go.

1515
02:07:57.32 --> 02:07:58.32
You get a new rash guard.

1516
02:07:58.32 --> 02:07:59.32
You want to go training,

1517
02:07:59.32 --> 02:08:00.32
you're like,

1518
02:08:00.32 --> 02:08:01.32
you get a new gear.

1519
02:08:01.32 --> 02:08:02.32
You want to train?

1520
02:08:02.32 --> 02:08:03.32
Yeah.

1521
02:08:03.32 --> 02:08:04.32
So that's kind of,

1522
02:08:04.32 --> 02:08:05.32
that's baby effector as well.

1523
02:08:05.32 --> 02:08:06.32
There's a little place above.

1524
02:08:06.32 --> 02:08:07.32
Yeah.

1525
02:08:07.32 --> 02:08:08.32
Yeah.

1526
02:08:08.32 --> 02:08:09.32
Placibo.

1527
02:08:09.32 --> 02:08:10.32
Placibo.

1528
02:08:10.32 --> 02:08:11.32
Placibo.

1529
02:08:11.32 --> 02:08:12.32
Yeah.

1530
02:08:12.32 --> 02:08:13.32
And that's,

1531
02:08:13.32 --> 02:08:14.32
I call it,

1532
02:08:14.32 --> 02:08:15.32
getting out.

1533
02:08:15.32 --> 02:08:16.32
Right.

1534
02:08:16.32 --> 02:08:17.32
So yeah.

1535
02:08:17.32 --> 02:08:18.32
Jockelstar.com.

1536
02:08:18.32 --> 02:08:20.32
Some women stuff, some women's t-shirts.

1537
02:08:20.32 --> 02:08:21.32
Coming out soon.

1538
02:08:21.32 --> 02:08:22.32
Oh.

1539
02:08:22.32 --> 02:08:23.32
But you know,

1540
02:08:23.32 --> 02:08:24.32
now that you say that,

1541
02:08:24.32 --> 02:08:25.32
they better be actually coming out soon.

1542
02:08:25.32 --> 02:08:26.32
I know.

1543
02:08:26.32 --> 02:08:28.32
I think my clock is counting down.

1544
02:08:28.32 --> 02:08:29.32
My Debbie clock.

1545
02:08:29.32 --> 02:08:31.32
Debbie gave me like a countdown.

1546
02:08:31.32 --> 02:08:31.32
Oh,

1547
02:08:31.32 --> 02:08:33.32
the deadline.

1548
02:08:33.32 --> 02:08:34.32
The straight up deadline.

1549
02:08:34.32 --> 02:08:34.32
You know,

1550
02:08:34.32 --> 02:08:35.32
to give me one month.

1551
02:08:35.32 --> 02:08:37.32
It's leading up the chain of command.

1552
02:08:37.32 --> 02:08:37.32
Yeah.

1553
02:08:37.32 --> 02:08:37.32
Yeah.

1554
02:08:37.32 --> 02:08:38.32
Respect.

1555
02:08:38.32 --> 02:08:39.32
You expect, I know.

1556
02:08:39.32 --> 02:08:42.32
You can also get some.

1557
02:08:42.32 --> 02:08:44.32
Jockel white tea.

1558
02:08:44.32 --> 02:08:45.32
If you want to drink some tea,

1559
02:08:45.32 --> 02:08:46.32
that tastes really good.

1560
02:08:46.32 --> 02:08:47.32
If you haven't tried it yet,

1561
02:08:47.32 --> 02:08:49.32
it doesn't taste like tea.

1562
02:08:49.32 --> 02:08:51.32
And it doesn't taste like anything else.

1563
02:08:51.32 --> 02:08:53.32
It tastes like something really good.

1564
02:08:53.32 --> 02:08:54.32
So,

1565
02:08:54.32 --> 02:08:55.32
so give it a shot.

1566
02:08:55.32 --> 02:08:57.32
And a lot of people have replaced

1567
02:08:57.32 --> 02:09:00.32
every other beverage in their diet.

1568
02:09:00.32 --> 02:09:02.32
With Jockel white tea.

1569
02:09:02.32 --> 02:09:03.32
And on top of that,

1570
02:09:03.32 --> 02:09:04.32
we got a little something new coming out.

1571
02:09:04.32 --> 02:09:06.32
That can be used for tea,

1572
02:09:06.32 --> 02:09:07.32
or for coffee,

1573
02:09:07.32 --> 02:09:09.32
or for milk,

1574
02:09:09.32 --> 02:09:10.32
or for cream,

1575
02:09:10.32 --> 02:09:12.32
and it's a big old mug.

1576
02:09:12.32 --> 02:09:14.32
So those are going to be on Amazon.

1577
02:09:14.32 --> 02:09:15.32
And the mug,

1578
02:09:15.32 --> 02:09:17.32
it's just a big black mug.

1579
02:09:17.32 --> 02:09:21.32
And then written on the mug is.

1580
02:09:21.32 --> 02:09:22.32
It just says,

1581
02:09:22.32 --> 02:09:23.32
get after it.

1582
02:09:23.32 --> 02:09:24.32
So you can,

1583
02:09:24.32 --> 02:09:25.32
you can get one of those.

1584
02:09:25.32 --> 02:09:27.32
It also says approved.

1585
02:09:27.32 --> 02:09:28.32
Yeah.

1586
02:09:28.32 --> 02:09:29.32
It was approved.

1587
02:09:29.32 --> 02:09:30.32
It's approved.

1588
02:09:30.32 --> 02:09:31.32
In fact, by me.

1589
02:09:31.32 --> 02:09:33.32
So you get those mugs.

1590
02:09:33.32 --> 02:09:35.32
And they're pretty cool.

1591
02:09:35.32 --> 02:09:37.32
And then also you get the book

1592
02:09:37.32 --> 02:09:38.32
Extreme Watership,

1593
02:09:38.32 --> 02:09:39.32
which I wrote with my brother,

1594
02:09:39.32 --> 02:09:40.32
Late Babin.

1595
02:09:40.32 --> 02:09:40.32
And,

1596
02:09:40.32 --> 02:09:42.32
pick it up.

1597
02:09:42.32 --> 02:09:43.32
You know what?

1598
02:09:43.32 --> 02:09:45.32
A lot of what I dig is when people buy it

1599
02:09:45.32 --> 02:09:46.32
for themselves.

1600
02:09:46.32 --> 02:09:49.32
And then three days later after they get done reading it,

1601
02:09:49.32 --> 02:09:51.32
they buy four more for the people that are on their team.

1602
02:09:51.32 --> 02:09:53.32
And then they buy one for their boss.

1603
02:09:53.32 --> 02:09:56.32
And then they buy one for the five people that are in their

1604
02:09:56.32 --> 02:09:59.32
peers team.

1605
02:09:59.32 --> 02:10:05.32
And they just spread the word because they want to make their life easier by having people getting after it all around them and taking extreme ownership.

1606
02:10:05.32 --> 02:10:08.32
And if you do want to kind of keep,

1607
02:10:08.32 --> 02:10:11.32
keep cruising with,

1608
02:10:11.32 --> 02:10:12.32
you know,

1609
02:10:12.32 --> 02:10:14.32
with echo Charles and myself,

1610
02:10:14.32 --> 02:10:17.32
you can find us actually on the interwebs,

1611
02:10:17.32 --> 02:10:21.32
on the interwebs on Twitter,

1612
02:10:21.32 --> 02:10:24.32
on also on Instagram,

1613
02:10:24.32 --> 02:10:29.32
and also we are kind of all apart in the Facebook.

1614
02:10:29.32 --> 02:10:30.32
Facebook,

1615
02:10:30.32 --> 02:10:32.32
if you want to get that,

1616
02:10:32.32 --> 02:10:38.32
echo that echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willing.

1617
02:10:38.32 --> 02:10:41.32
And,

1618
02:10:41.32 --> 02:10:43.32
I guess finally,

1619
02:10:43.32 --> 02:10:45.32
thanks for listening tonight.

1620
02:10:45.32 --> 02:10:48.32
Everybody that's out there in uniform,

1621
02:10:48.32 --> 02:10:50.32
serving,

1622
02:10:50.32 --> 02:10:53.32
work with some police this week.

1623
02:10:53.32 --> 02:10:56.32
Awesome.

1624
02:10:56.32 --> 02:10:58.32
Thanks for what you do.

1625
02:10:58.32 --> 02:10:59.32
Thanks for your service.

1626
02:10:59.32 --> 02:11:01.32
Thanks for protecting the homeland.

1627
02:11:01.32 --> 02:11:03.32
Folks that are overseas.

1628
02:11:03.32 --> 02:11:06.32
Thank you for what you're doing.

1629
02:11:06.32 --> 02:11:08.32
Stay aggressive.

1630
02:11:08.32 --> 02:11:11.32
Stay ahead of the enemy.

1631
02:11:11.32 --> 02:11:14.32
Keep getting after it.

1632
02:11:14.32 --> 02:11:20.32
And then to all the troopers that I'm meeting all the time.

1633
02:11:20.32 --> 02:11:23.32
Every industry, every industry you can imagine.

1634
02:11:23.32 --> 02:11:27.32
That are out there making things happen.

1635
02:11:27.32 --> 02:11:31.32
Turning and burning day to day.

1636
02:11:31.32 --> 02:11:33.32
Crushing things,

1637
02:11:33.32 --> 02:11:40.32
whether it's so massive project that you are completely devoted to doing,

1638
02:11:40.32 --> 02:11:42.32
and doing it perfectly,

1639
02:11:42.32 --> 02:11:43.32
or you know what,

1640
02:11:43.32 --> 02:11:45.32
there's plenty of people that hit me up and they say,

1641
02:11:45.32 --> 02:11:47.32
hey, you know what I got to do?

1642
02:11:47.32 --> 02:11:49.32
A bunch of stupid administrative tasks today,

1643
02:11:49.32 --> 02:11:50.32
yes, what?

1644
02:11:50.32 --> 02:11:53.32
I'm going to line them up and I'm going to crush them.

1645
02:11:53.32 --> 02:11:58.32
So wherever you are on today on that spectrum,

1646
02:11:58.32 --> 02:12:04.32
line them up and crush them.

1647
02:12:04.32 --> 02:12:08.32
So, until next time,

1648
02:12:08.32 --> 02:12:11.32
this is echo and jockel,

1649
02:12:11.32 --> 02:12:21.32
out.
