00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.50 This is Jocco podcast number 42 with echo Charles and me joccal willing
00:00:07.28 --> 00:00:09.28 Good evening echo good evening
00:00:10.48 --> 00:00:12.48 now
00:00:12.48 --> 00:00:14.48 in podcast
00:00:14.72 --> 00:00:16.48 number 11
00:00:16.48 --> 00:00:22.02 We brought on life-babbin who was the Charlie Platoon commander
00:00:22.02 --> 00:00:28.76 Charlie Platoon was a part of task unit bruiser. Obviously, life is one of my brothers guy wrote the book
00:00:28.76 --> 00:00:30.76 Extreme ownership with so
00:00:32.16 --> 00:00:36.22 That's life Charlie Platoon and when he was on that first podcast
00:00:36.72 --> 00:00:40.36 We talked about a bunch of things, but one of the main focuses of our conversation
00:00:41.60 --> 00:00:43.60 was
00:00:43.60 --> 00:00:45.60 Some of the brothers that we lost
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.36 Mark Lee who is the first seal killed in Iraq
00:00:49.56 --> 00:00:51.56 We talked about big holes
00:00:52.68 --> 00:00:54.68 Ryan Job
00:00:54.68 --> 00:00:59.60 Who was gravely wounded in Ramadi and who later died after complications
00:01:00.24 --> 00:01:02.24 From a surgery to repair those wounds
00:01:03.40 --> 00:01:05.40 then finally we talked about
00:01:06.40 --> 00:01:08.40 Chris Kyle who
00:01:08.84 --> 00:01:15.08 Was also in Charlie Platoon was the lead sniper and point man and who ended up writing the book American sniper
00:01:15.68 --> 00:01:20.72 Which was you know turned into a very successful movie and Chris as you know
00:01:20.72 --> 00:01:27.92 Was senselessly murdered as he tried to help out a fellow veteran and
00:01:31.04 --> 00:01:35.84 On that podcast we didn't talk in any depth at all about
00:01:36.56 --> 00:01:38.56 Mikey Montsour
00:01:38.56 --> 00:01:42.64 Who is another one of our brother seals from task unit bruiser
00:01:43.40 --> 00:01:49.08 Who's also killed in Ramadi and if you don't know Mikey was posh and was the award at the Medal of Honor
00:01:49.08 --> 00:01:51.08 after he
00:01:51.44 --> 00:01:55.92 Smothered a grenade with his body in order to save three of our other teammates
00:01:58.44 --> 00:02:06.24 And one of the reasons I didn't want to focus on Mikey during that podcast is because Mike he was in Delta, but to
00:02:06.68 --> 00:02:11.72 As opposed to Charlie Ptun Charlie's two Patoons in the task unit Charlie and Delta and
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000 Charlie was
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.24 Life was the Patoon commander and Tony a Friday who was on the podcast as well. He was the the Patoon chief and before I
00:02:23.56 --> 00:02:27.16 Went and talked about Mikey. I wanted to bring somebody from Delta
00:02:27.72 --> 00:02:29.72 Platoon on the podcast
00:02:31.08 --> 00:02:36.52 That's a little bit trickier than it sounds because most of the guys from Delta, but to our
00:02:37.56 --> 00:02:39.56 Still active duty and
00:02:39.56 --> 00:02:44.84 The ones that aren't active duty. I will they're not around. I couldn't get get hold of them or if I get it hold of them. They
00:02:47.16 --> 00:02:51.40 They were busy or I they were out in the area so it's just been hard. It's been a challenge
00:02:52.04 --> 00:02:54.04 but I get to want to wait and
00:02:54.76 --> 00:02:56.76 finally
00:02:58.36 --> 00:03:02.04 And today we're lucky because I got one of my one of my good bros here
00:03:02.04 --> 00:03:08.92 Guy by the name of Andrew Paul who was the assistant platoon commander in Delta platoon
00:03:09.48 --> 00:03:11.48 Task unit bruiser seal team three
00:03:13.64 --> 00:03:15.24 But I wanted to start off today
00:03:16.68 --> 00:03:18.68 By reading a speech
00:03:19.40 --> 00:03:21.40 that I gave
00:03:21.40 --> 00:03:24.04 At one of the ceremonies that took place when Mikey
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000 Was awarded the Medal of Honor
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.76 And this was not the ceremony that took place at the White House with President Bush which
00:03:33.32 --> 00:03:38.04 Actually the entirety of Task unit bruiser did attend that and it was awesome
00:03:39.48 --> 00:03:47.16 But I gave this speech at a navy ceremony that took place. I think it took place later in the day or perhaps the next day
00:03:47.72 --> 00:03:50.76 At the navy memorial in Washington DC and
00:03:50.76 --> 00:03:55.32 That day there was a ton of senior naval officers in attendance and
00:03:57.24 --> 00:04:01.48 Basically the whole of the senior army of the of the navy was there
00:04:02.36 --> 00:04:06.92 You know this the chief naval operations in the sector in the navy and there was a bunch of other
00:04:07.48 --> 00:04:11.80 Medal of Honor winners there included a couple other seal Medal of Honor winners
00:04:13.48 --> 00:04:15.48 And it was a
00:04:16.60 --> 00:04:18.60 A very fitting day
00:04:18.60 --> 00:04:24.36 It was a great honor for me to be able to give this speech
00:04:27.48 --> 00:04:29.48 And here it is
00:04:31.88 --> 00:04:33.88 Ladies and gentlemen
00:04:34.84 --> 00:04:42.12 It is obviously very humbling to be here today as it was humbling to be on the battlefield of Ramadi with my fellow seals
00:04:42.12 --> 00:04:53.32 And the two two eight brigade combat team the iron soldiers and then the one one AD the ready first combat team
00:04:54.04 --> 00:04:59.64 Which was formed up by our brothers from the army navy air force and Marines
00:05:02.20 --> 00:05:08.36 And it included such hallowed units as the first to the 506 band of brothers
00:05:08.36 --> 00:05:13.32 The one three seven bandits and the three eight Marines
00:05:16.12 --> 00:05:22.84 I met Mike Montsore when he checked into seal team three as a new highly motivated young frog man
00:05:24.28 --> 00:05:29.40 As we trained and prepared to deploy to Iraq everyone learned that Mike was an incredible person
00:05:30.20 --> 00:05:34.68 He was gifted at everything he did hardworking funny and selfless
00:05:34.68 --> 00:05:41.40 He was the ultimate teammate the ultimate friend
00:05:45.72 --> 00:05:49.000 When Mike died a picture of him circulated in the news
00:05:50.84 --> 00:05:58.36 It showed Mike and his platoon mates in the war torn streets of Ramadi shrouded in a mist of greenish yellow smoke
00:05:58.36 --> 00:06:01.000 Which was used to mask their movement from the enemy
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.44 That picture says so much
00:06:08.44 --> 00:06:15.96 Mike's gun is at the ready his face is calm almost smiling despite the obvious chaos and danger around him
00:06:17.80 --> 00:06:22.92 Ramadi at the time was the epicenter of the insurgency in Iraq a city filled with peril
00:06:24.04 --> 00:06:30.36 The hardened enemy was bent on destruction they fought with ruthlessness constantly on the attack with
00:06:30.36 --> 00:06:33.88 Machingons, mortars, grenades and IEDs
00:06:36.12 --> 00:06:39.32 Brave men died or wounded every day
00:06:40.84 --> 00:06:45.88 And every day brave men continue to push forward into the fray
00:06:48.12 --> 00:06:52.60 For those of us who were there that picture of Mike captures all of this
00:06:52.60 --> 00:06:58.52 In the picture his brother seals are nearby but Mike is out front
00:07:00.36 --> 00:07:04.44 I have looked at this picture over and over again and it speaks to me
00:07:06.04 --> 00:07:12.36 As someone that had the pleasure of knowing Mike he is a friend and had the honor of serving with him on the battle field
00:07:13.96 --> 00:07:15.96 This photograph tells me a story
00:07:18.44 --> 00:07:20.44 As I look at that picture
00:07:20.44 --> 00:07:25.16 I hear a voice in a humble but confident tone
00:07:27.24 --> 00:07:29.24 This voice says to me
00:07:32.20 --> 00:07:33.72 I am Michael Monsour
00:07:35.32 --> 00:07:37.72 I am patrolling through the streets of Ramadi
00:07:38.60 --> 00:07:40.76 It is a city devastated by war
00:07:41.48 --> 00:07:44.20 Bullet holes cover the rubber rubble the buildings
00:07:45.24 --> 00:07:47.24 Burned out cars litter the streets
00:07:47.24 --> 00:07:50.92 I am walking just behind my point man
00:07:52.28 --> 00:07:53.24 I am ready
00:07:54.60 --> 00:07:56.60 My eyes sting from the sweat
00:07:57.24 --> 00:08:01.08 My gun and gear are heavy but these things do not bother me
00:08:02.52 --> 00:08:09.24 There is no comfort here but this is the life I have chosen and there is no other place I would rather be
00:08:11.64 --> 00:08:13.000 I am Michael Monsour
00:08:13.72 --> 00:08:15.48 I pray and I believe
00:08:15.48 --> 00:08:20.20 My faith is my shelter my faith is my strength
00:08:21.80 --> 00:08:27.72 Fear thrives in this place but fear is no match for my faith faith conquerors all
00:08:29.56 --> 00:08:35.32 The word of the Lord proves true he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him
00:08:37.24 --> 00:08:39.96 Lord protect my brothers above all else
00:08:39.96 --> 00:08:45.56 You have made me ready to protect them
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.52 I am Michael Monsour
00:08:48.52 --> 00:08:50.20 I am far away from home
00:08:50.20 --> 00:08:51.40 I miss my family
00:08:51.96 --> 00:08:55.40 I miss my mother my father my sister and my brothers
00:08:57.08 --> 00:08:59.72 Everything I am is rooted in them
00:09:00.92 --> 00:09:03.64 I want to hold my nephews and nieces again
00:09:03.64 --> 00:09:05.40 I want to make them smile and laugh
00:09:05.40 --> 00:09:09.40 But I am far away from home
00:09:11.40 --> 00:09:14.76 Instead I smile at the Iraqi children when we pass them by
00:09:15.48 --> 00:09:19.40 When we encounter Iraqi families I treat them with respect and dignity
00:09:20.76 --> 00:09:26.44 I know the importance of family because there is nothing more important to me than my family
00:09:26.44 --> 00:09:34.44 I am Michael Monsour
00:09:34.44 --> 00:09:35.80 I love my country my fellow seals and the man fighting alongside us
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000 The man fighting alongside us in the streets are infantry men grunts
00:09:42.84 --> 00:09:49.24 I know these grunts are not just soldiers and marines but fathers and brothers and sons
00:09:49.24 --> 00:09:55.96 I know because my father and brother were also grunts proud marine riflemen
00:09:58.36 --> 00:10:03.88 We are fighting a determined enemy but we are strong our strength is our brotherhood
00:10:04.92 --> 00:10:08.92 Soldiers sailors, airmen and marines fighting together
00:10:09.88 --> 00:10:13.64 A brotherhood bound by sweat and blood and tears
00:10:13.64 --> 00:10:21.64 Together we live in dust and dirt and filth and death
00:10:23.48 --> 00:10:25.48 Death is everywhere
00:10:25.88 --> 00:10:27.88 Many of my brothers have fallen
00:10:29.16 --> 00:10:31.40 Mark is gone
00:10:33.64 --> 00:10:34.84 But we fight on
00:10:36.04 --> 00:10:40.84 For the men to our left and right we fight on
00:10:40.84 --> 00:10:46.04 I'm so proud to be part of this band of brothers

00:11:11.32 --> 00:11:12.68 I am Michael Monsour
00:11:13.88 --> 00:11:16.36 I am the frogman on the high ground
00:11:19.40 --> 00:11:21.16 And I have given everything
00:11:22.60 --> 00:11:24.60 for you
00:11:24.60 --> 00:11:36.76 And that was the speech
00:11:40.12 --> 00:11:42.28 And I did my best to
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.60 Share my thoughts about Mikey
00:11:48.60 --> 00:11:53.000 And I am honored to have
00:11:55.64 --> 00:11:57.64 And you are all with me today
00:11:57.64 --> 00:12:01.32 Like I said the former assistant Patoon Commander from Delta Patoon
00:12:03.40 --> 00:12:04.76 To share some stories about
00:12:05.64 --> 00:12:08.68 Remodied about Mikey and about Tasking Abuser and about
00:12:09.40 --> 00:12:10.12 himself
00:12:10.84 --> 00:12:13.24 And the lessons that he learned over there
00:12:15.08 --> 00:12:16.84 And how he carried those lessons
00:12:16.84 --> 00:12:20.84 To civilian life and the kind of challenges he faced there
00:12:24.92 --> 00:12:25.24 So
00:12:26.92 --> 00:12:27.72 Andrew Paul
00:12:28.68 --> 00:12:29.24 My brother
00:12:30.20 --> 00:12:31.56 Welcome to the show
00:12:31.56 --> 00:12:33.000 Thanks for coming on
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.12 Thanks for having me, bro
00:12:35.16 --> 00:12:36.60 It's an honor to be here and you know
00:12:37.64 --> 00:12:40.20 The main thing, listen to that speech, I remember when you gave it
00:12:40.84 --> 00:12:43.72 My hope and prayer today is that whenever I do here today
00:12:43.72 --> 00:12:45.56 It honors as a legacy of our brothers
00:12:45.56 --> 00:12:47.56 Absolutely
00:12:47.56 --> 00:12:49.56 Absolutely
00:12:51.16 --> 00:12:54.28 And we'll get into plenty of that
00:12:56.28 --> 00:12:59.80 But in order and I hate to do this because everybody does this when they start
00:13:00.52 --> 00:13:02.52 Like this type of situation
00:13:02.52 --> 00:13:04.76 It's almost like a bar pickup line
00:13:04.76 --> 00:13:06.36 You know, hey, where are you from?
00:13:06.36 --> 00:13:07.08 Right
00:13:07.08 --> 00:13:07.40 So
00:13:08.76 --> 00:13:10.76 That being said Andrew, so where are you from?
00:13:11.32 --> 00:13:11.88 Where am I from?
00:13:11.88 --> 00:13:13.08 From New England
00:13:13.08 --> 00:13:13.88 New Hampshire
00:13:13.88 --> 00:13:18.28 You know what we had Tony's Tony was just on another New England, that's right
00:13:18.28 --> 00:13:20.28 If I don't get some boys from Texas on here
00:13:20.28 --> 00:13:22.44 I'm gonna get I'm gonna get I'm gonna start here about it
00:13:22.44 --> 00:13:25.72 You're gonna be real hard to grow up in New England let me tell you it's cold
00:13:25.72 --> 00:13:26.68 Drew
00:13:27.40 --> 00:13:28.36 So so
00:13:29.24 --> 00:13:33.40 You grew up in New England and and by the way for those of you that just listen on the podcast
00:13:35.72 --> 00:13:36.52 What do you weigh?
00:13:36.52 --> 00:13:37.16 One
00:13:37.56 --> 00:13:42.52 155 155 so the the the image that everyone has of the big ABC
00:13:42.52 --> 00:13:48.92 You'll is not first of all it's not true. They're seals coming every shape and every size and Andrew comes in the smaller size
00:13:50.20 --> 00:13:53.56 And so but how did you so so wait?
00:13:53.56 --> 00:13:57.88 How did you how did you have a hit how did you hear about the skills like what made you decide that that was what you wanted to do?
00:13:57.88 --> 00:14:02.04 Yeah, you know, I'm first of all I've always been the kind of person that like tell me
00:14:02.04 --> 00:14:07.40 I can't do something and I'm gonna just show you so I mean things like oh we're in high school and someone says
00:14:07.40 --> 00:14:12.12 We're talking about like the Boston marathon and I'm like oh I'm gonna oh you can't do the marathon
00:14:12.12 --> 00:14:14.12 Oh, okay watch this
00:14:14.12 --> 00:14:16.12 Right the Boston marathon
00:14:16.12 --> 00:14:18.12 but you know
00:14:18.44 --> 00:14:24.28 Probably saw a movie because you know when I was growing up there wasn't a lot of information out there about the seal teams and so tell me about it
00:14:24.44 --> 00:14:27.08 Right, I mean even less for an old guy like you
00:14:28.12 --> 00:14:30.52 So there wasn't a lot of information but somehow you know
00:14:30.76 --> 00:14:36.12 Probably saw a movie and it had breathing a book and then you know started to do some research and found well first of all
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000 outside my immediate family
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.68 Uncle's grandfather all served in the military so grew up with that song strong sense of
00:14:45.40 --> 00:14:47.40 One into serve my country and
00:14:47.96 --> 00:14:51.56 Always had a sense of wanting to protect people who couldn't protect themselves
00:14:51.56 --> 00:14:58.04 So it was drawn to that kind of line of work then began to read about the seal teams and at least from what information
00:14:58.04 --> 00:14:59.000 I had available
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.68 It seemed like hey they were the best so I'm like all right. Well if that's the best them that's what I want to go do
00:15:02.68 --> 00:15:05.64 I know that was you know, yeah, it's infancy as it could be on kid
00:15:05.64 --> 00:15:11.000 But then man and just got out of that like a bulldog bulldog on a pork shop and just I mean
00:15:11.56 --> 00:15:15.16 Tunnel vision went after it and you did you go to college?
00:15:15.48 --> 00:15:19.88 Did you already have that decision in your mind when you went to college? Oh, yeah, you knew you're gonna go to OCS
00:15:19.88 --> 00:15:25.32 You knew all that did you know I did ROTC so the thing is is that I don't know anything
00:15:25.32 --> 00:15:28.28 I mean I didn't know about I didn't know what ROTC was
00:15:28.28 --> 00:15:32.44 I didn't even know what in listing was I had no clue no would no no exposure
00:15:32.44 --> 00:15:37.48 I just knew I wanted to be a seal so you know, but we started looking at going to college and I went down
00:15:37.48 --> 00:15:42.20 And I looked at Vanderbilt University among others John Hopkins or RPI goes an engineering major
00:15:42.52 --> 00:15:45.96 And I knew nothing and also they walk into this almost like job fair
00:15:46.28 --> 00:15:49.56 Kind of style thing like welcome check out the school and there's this guy and uniform
00:15:49.56 --> 00:15:53.40 And these of course got a picture like some navy seal frog man coming out of the water over the beach
00:15:53.72 --> 00:15:57.32 And I was like hey, what's this realistic picture of all time right because that's what we do every day
00:15:58.12 --> 00:16:01.56 Right and I hate what's this he goes oh this is ROTC and what would say so what you
00:16:01.56 --> 00:16:07.48 Go to college we pay for college and then you go the navy and like wait you can be a seal through this program
00:16:07.48 --> 00:16:13.16 He's like oh yeah absolutely big lie like they take like 16 guys a year
00:16:13.24 --> 00:16:17.16 Yeah, but oh yeah, you can be a seal. Oh, okay. Let me get this straight so I go to college
00:16:17.96 --> 00:16:23.24 You pay for it watch this I get to go in the navy and I can be a seal. Yeah
00:16:23.24 --> 00:16:25.48 Oh my god, sorry me up so that's how I found out about ROTC
00:16:25.48 --> 00:16:31.64 Recruiter just straight truth from a recruiter you got to love it. That's right. Yeah. Yes. You can be a seal little did I know
00:16:32.12 --> 00:16:34.44 So you get done with
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.32 College get your commission you do ROTC
00:16:37.32 --> 00:16:40.20 Yeah, and then you go to go to Buds show up to Buds
00:16:40.92 --> 00:16:45.08 That was funny. I showed up so I asked the ROTC instructor hey
00:16:45.32 --> 00:16:50.84 You know like what's the process for checking in do I just like what should I wear? I'll just wear you know
00:16:50.84 --> 00:16:57.88 Proprits of the entire so I show up to the Buds quarter deck and like a college shirt
00:16:58.44 --> 00:17:01.000 Walk onto the quarter deck and one of the most
00:17:01.24 --> 00:17:05.80 sadistic instructors possible happen to be standing there. I walk on and my hey
00:17:06.44 --> 00:17:08.44 Yeah, I'm here to check in like
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.40 Like the all-seeing I just like
00:17:11.64 --> 00:17:15.88 Glances like you said what I'll so I'm checking into Buds
00:17:15.88 --> 00:17:22.20 Wearing that I'm like maybe I should go put in for money. Yeah, good idea
00:17:22.92 --> 00:17:28.36 Run out to my car three minutes of your uniform son right went on put on my STBs
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.80 Came back promptly got wet and sanding. Yeah, that's how it works. Yeah STBs
00:17:33.80 --> 00:17:39.48 Because you don't know it's like the the high level uniform with all the ribbons and all that crap on it
00:17:39.48 --> 00:17:44.20 And you got to you know you got to take a care of it so when you take that and you wear it down to the ocean and then you
00:17:44.20 --> 00:17:48.36 Jump in the ocean and roll around in the sand. It's not a good deal. So that's a good news
00:17:48.36 --> 00:17:51.16 There weren't a lot of ribbons on there yet. Yeah, yeah one ribbons
00:17:52.76 --> 00:17:57.40 So so and you end up going through Buds with life, right which people know who life is obviously
00:17:58.52 --> 00:18:03.000 Which is cool and then you get done with buds any I mean buds is buds
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.44 I don't know the care about buds. Yeah, that's some funny late stories though
00:18:07.72 --> 00:18:12.44 Talk about my bro. So I got I got pneumonia in hell week first time through so I got rollback
00:18:12.44 --> 00:18:16.12 Start over so and then and then life
00:18:16.84 --> 00:18:24.60 Transfer then so life was our was our class leader and so me the Delta-Platin commander who one day you'll hear from
00:18:25.72 --> 00:18:30.84 And he and I we all went through Buds together, but they were both lateral transfers and so they were senior to me and rank
00:18:30.84 --> 00:18:33.40 Right, they're already like JJ and a full lieutenant and
00:18:34.04 --> 00:18:40.84 So there's games and buds right like you're trying to win so you know we were we were wise to the games already to try and win in
00:18:40.84 --> 00:18:46.84 Lave if you know by brother is like life is black in white with my brother way
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.64 Okay, so I'm gonna hear about this one, but he so you know it's right and it's wrong and there's like and so we know we're like
00:18:53.64 --> 00:18:57.48 You know and buds sort of like if you ain't cheating you ain't trying and if you got you ain't trying hard enough
00:18:57.48 --> 00:19:02.04 I mean so and there's an element of that and buds obviously not completely, but so you know
00:19:02.04 --> 00:19:08.52 We're we're pulling all kinds of games and his book who is losing because we are just we're cheating to win and
00:19:08.52 --> 00:19:09.88 And
00:19:09.88 --> 00:19:15.24 He's getting so pissed like after the race like after class. He's like okay, you got and then he finally wasn't up and started playing
00:19:15.80 --> 00:19:23.32 Yeah, that thing about you ain't cheating you ain't trying that sort of a that's sort of one side of buds right and what was cool is when I went through Buds
00:19:23.72 --> 00:19:26.52 They actually told us like these couple instructors were like listen
00:19:27.40 --> 00:19:32.12 That's a little saying it's not true right and they they actually said if you're cheating
00:19:32.12 --> 00:19:38.36 You're cheating yourself right which I was and then obviously then they start saying look if you got guys that are cheating here
00:19:38.44 --> 00:19:42.12 To get through this training. Yeah, you really want them in the teams with you. No, right?
00:19:42.12 --> 00:19:47.48 I don't want a guy that that has to cheat to complete a run or swim negative. Yeah, I mean that there's there was
00:19:47.48 --> 00:19:50.92 It's been like cheating like cutting off the run versus like you're in competition
00:19:50.92 --> 00:19:55.96 You're knocking the other guy whatever you know competing hitting a guy in the face of the paddle just that type of thing
00:19:55.96 --> 00:19:57.000 Right
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.88 So you get done so you get done because you were junior when you get to the T you went right to team three
00:20:01.88 --> 00:20:05.40 Right, yeah, so you get to team three, but you don't get to go on to point with team three
00:20:05.56 --> 00:20:12.04 They hook you up with being a boat unit commander. Yeah, so no one's gonna know what that is all right
00:20:12.04 --> 00:20:14.04 So so the deal wasn't and
00:20:14.76 --> 00:20:18.76 This is changed throughout the years, but like when I checked into team three
00:20:19.16 --> 00:20:22.44 There was this brief period of time where was in charge of the time decided that
00:20:22.84 --> 00:20:26.76 Third dose and a opportunity was a bad idea for off-sort of element. This is no more third dose
00:20:27.40 --> 00:20:29.16 so
00:20:29.16 --> 00:20:32.76 Basically I was faced with being a
00:20:33.24 --> 00:20:35.24 Talk jockey or
00:20:35.96 --> 00:20:39.96 Going over to the boat team and at least being a judge or something to get some leadership experience
00:20:39.96 --> 00:20:43.08 So I went over to the special boat team which is part of the Naval Special Warfare and
00:20:43.56 --> 00:20:50.84 Ultimately when they deploy the deploy as part of the task unit and are the task group and it's all integrated in part of
00:20:51.32 --> 00:20:54.44 You know visit board searches see-jure maritime operations such as
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000 Leadership interdiction maritime interdiction operations and so the boat unit which is
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000 Special boat teams is
00:21:02.36 --> 00:21:08.84 Run essentially at the at the leadership level by seals so the commanding officer the boat unit the executive officer is our
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.68 Seals the boat that OIC is the Mark Files all of it. I'll have Mark Fives anymore
00:21:13.48 --> 00:21:18.52 Our seal officers so look as a brand new officer at least had an opportunity to deploy in a
00:21:19.56 --> 00:21:24.92 In a combat zone to lead men and end to work with my seal brothers who were conducting operations in the northern region go
00:21:24.92 --> 00:21:28.36 Yeah, and just an overview. I was gonna sum this up as quickly as I can
00:21:28.36 --> 00:21:37.48 So obviously seals work on water a lot and we we drive our own little bullets our own little you know 12 foot Zodiac boats with 55
00:21:37.48 --> 00:21:40.20 Horse power motors on them or 35 horse power motors on them or whatever
00:21:40.76 --> 00:21:44.84 But the bigger boats we don't we don't drive those so anything you know
00:21:44.84 --> 00:21:50.20 You see any of those bigger boats are driven by these guys that are called they're now called
00:21:50.60 --> 00:21:55.08 Special warfare combat and crewmen which are guys that that's what they do their boat drivers
00:21:55.08 --> 00:22:01.000 So they do they insert an extract us no drop there drop there boats out of
00:22:01.56 --> 00:22:08.36 Various aircraft it's so it's a legit job and they and then that's what they do and so you were in charge of a group of those guys
00:22:08.36 --> 00:22:13.16 Took boats on deployment right to the rabbing golf and did what you did over there
00:22:13.72 --> 00:22:20.44 Right the reality is is not the it's not the dream for the seal young seal officer to be that to do that
00:22:20.44 --> 00:22:27.40 But it's a good like you said it's good all of a sudden you're in charge of some real you know, right you're when you're out of the water and I tell people
00:22:27.40 --> 00:22:30.60 I you tell people us when I was in the team to say listen when you're on the water
00:22:30.76 --> 00:22:34.20 It's a real world Bob because because if someone goes wrong when you're in the water
00:22:34.20 --> 00:22:37.24 I'm got first of all you can drown you could that's and you can get lost
00:22:37.24 --> 00:22:40.84 There's all kinds of bad things that happen so if you don't plan right on the water doesn't matter
00:22:40.84 --> 00:22:43.64 If there's enemy or not you got a big giant enemy
00:22:43.64 --> 00:22:48.52 It's called the ocean and they will kill you if you're not square it away and I think actually
00:22:48.52 --> 00:22:51.64 That's one of the things that makes seals good is that we work in the water and the water
00:22:51.64 --> 00:22:54.92 So one of the toughest enemies you come up so one forget it's on the tree
00:22:54.92 --> 00:23:02.28 Yeah, so that wraps up that you come home from that deployment. Yep, and now you are still a sealed team three
00:23:02.60 --> 00:23:04.52 Or you go back to seal team three
00:23:04.52 --> 00:23:09.32 I guess technically yeah, and now we form up and you become the Delta Pultune
00:23:10.20 --> 00:23:11.96 Assistant Pultune commander
00:23:12.12 --> 00:23:17.000 Checking it awesome working for the Delta Pultune commander who you you guys were rose are were bros
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.84 Yeah, we've known each other for years went through buds together and life
00:23:20.84 --> 00:23:25.08 So you guys must have been pretty stoked on that it was cool. It's kind of like getting the band back together
00:23:25.08 --> 00:23:28.60 You know, and those and look those two guys had just come off of
00:23:29.24 --> 00:23:36.04 Not the greatest deployments either in terms of a junior officer seal right because they were deployed and they were the Assistant commanders
00:23:36.04 --> 00:23:41.56 And they were getting stuck with not so fun work, you know, so that we were stoked to be all right
00:23:41.80 --> 00:23:43.40 They were so close. Hey now
00:23:43.40 --> 00:23:44.60 We're the OIC
00:23:44.60 --> 00:23:48.84 We're not gonna be the guy stuck back doing the paperwork and we're getting the band back together
00:23:48.84 --> 00:23:54.20 And then we found out you are our task unit commander. It was like oh, because we we all knew we were gonna be in the Pultune together
00:23:54.20 --> 00:23:57.08 And the task unit together. We didn't know who our TU commander was gonna be yet
00:23:57.32 --> 00:24:01.64 And then we were all those room or room or who are we gonna get and then we heard this guy jacco was coming over
00:24:01.64 --> 00:24:04.36 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
00:24:04.60 --> 00:24:08.52 I only knew who you were through them like one other guys like this. Oh, jacco
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.20 That asked do this is gonna be awesome right because like we already had an inkling that like if if this dude was gonna be
00:24:14.20 --> 00:24:16.44 To you commander, we had our best shot again didn't combat
00:24:17.56 --> 00:24:21.08 Although we had no idea what was about to happen good assessment. Yeah
00:24:22.36 --> 00:24:27.000 Yeah, your reputation was great, but you were coming over in that case for being the
00:24:27.48 --> 00:24:32.12 Admiralments coming from being the Admiralments. Yeah, yeah 13 months with with the Admiralment which was a
00:24:33.72 --> 00:24:35.72 A rough tour in terms of
00:24:36.36 --> 00:24:41.40 Things that normal seals same thing right like to do that's right and I and and
00:24:41.40 --> 00:24:46.44 You know for instance, I mean just just straight up wearing uniform every single day
00:24:46.44 --> 00:24:49.48 Wait, so people don't so people understand in the world
00:24:50.28 --> 00:24:54.60 When and I don't know what it's like this moment today when I was in the team so now is it
00:24:54.60 --> 00:24:58.44 Seal team one seal team two seal team seven we I didn't wear shirt
00:24:59.16 --> 00:25:03.16 Like no, I'm a 35 year old man making money doing with a family
00:25:03.16 --> 00:25:06.20 I'm not wearing a shirt at work like oh, I'm in my office cool. I'm not wearing a shirt
00:25:06.20 --> 00:25:08.52 I wear shorts and a pair of jungle boots, right that's it
00:25:08.52 --> 00:25:13.96 So I do that for my whole life right since I was a kid since I was a 19 year old kid
00:25:14.28 --> 00:25:20.12 When I got through but so I now I go to be the Admirals aid and I have to wear uniform every day
00:25:20.36 --> 00:25:28.68 Not just one uniform. I have to wear cackies then whites then blues and you're just in this constant uniform and and seals are not good about
00:25:29.40 --> 00:25:32.36 Uniforms they're just not it's not one of our strong points and
00:25:33.24 --> 00:25:36.36 So so that's one of the things that made the job
00:25:36.36 --> 00:25:39.88 Not very fun, but there's a good lesson there, right? So here
00:25:39.88 --> 00:25:43.16 I mean everybody knows you as an incredible leader
00:25:43.72 --> 00:25:49.32 Awesome seal and yet for this period of time you had to do this job that was not particularly fun
00:25:49.32 --> 00:25:52.68 Kind of like you know, I had to go over and be the the seal at the boat unit, right?
00:25:52.68 --> 00:25:58.28 But do life is full of things like that and when you were part of the team no matter what you do it to the best of your ability
00:25:58.28 --> 00:26:01.000 And you didn't awesome job as the Admirals aid
00:26:01.40 --> 00:26:04.36 Not necessarily what you wanted to do being a tried and wearing frog
00:26:04.36 --> 00:26:07.08 So I got an email from
00:26:07.80 --> 00:26:15.64 One of the assistant platoon commanders in Charlie Patoon a year ago and he said hey bro
00:26:16.12 --> 00:26:18.12 I'm gonna go be the aid yeah
00:26:19.96 --> 00:26:24.52 And so he I just saw him and he was laughing he goes your email back to me you said
00:26:25.24 --> 00:26:30.68 This is going to be very hard for you because you're not good at this kind of thing and I was pretty good at it
00:26:30.68 --> 00:26:34.92 So you're gonna have to work like extra hard to make this happen and he was laughing we're both laughing
00:26:34.92 --> 00:26:40.60 Yeah, because you know what I'm talking about it. He's not a guy that is all over the the my new ship
00:26:40.60 --> 00:26:42.84 Of course he did a great job because he stepped up his game
00:26:43.32 --> 00:26:48.28 But yeah when you get a task with something you do it and you do it the best your ability and and you know
00:26:48.28 --> 00:26:52.60 Just to continue that story because I have to say this it was it was a pain the ass job
00:26:52.84 --> 00:26:59.000 It wasn't fun for me, but man did I learn a lot did I understand a lot did I get to know
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.96 All the inner workings of of the community because I was there with the guy you know with the amylets and charge of all the seals
00:27:05.96 --> 00:27:07.96 I was with him
00:27:07.96 --> 00:27:14.76 For 13 months. I mean all day travel. You know wake up PT. We were just I'm every meeting, you know
00:27:14.76 --> 00:27:20.60 So it was it was a great learning experience for me and I was appreciative and he was a great guy
00:27:20.60 --> 00:27:24.52 He's a great guy now and he really cared about the seal platoon
00:27:24.52 --> 00:27:29.48 Which is which is awesome when a guy puts the no more priority. He'd always talk about okay
00:27:29.48 --> 00:27:33.24 What's the seal platoon need or how does this affect the seal platoon? Yeah, so
00:27:34.12 --> 00:27:37.64 Then we got it and now you're in your first workup right going through workup
00:27:38.60 --> 00:27:42.44 Getting your game on awesome best time my life
00:27:43.32 --> 00:27:47.08 Awesome yeah anybody's in the military right now in act of duty
00:27:47.40 --> 00:27:52.20 Teamed if you're listening to this band just enjoy it man enjoy it. I mean there's other things in life
00:27:52.20 --> 00:27:55.48 Sure, but like you can you just you can't replace that time
00:27:55.96 --> 00:28:01.32 It and there's stupid stuff you deal with yes, but trust me enjoy this man
00:28:01.72 --> 00:28:05.32 You won't find it anywhere else nothing like that awesome
00:28:06.28 --> 00:28:08.28 Yeah, do you what do you I?
00:28:08.28 --> 00:28:11.32 I talk about this sometimes so one of the
00:28:12.12 --> 00:28:15.32 Scars that you get from the militant from the seal teams
00:28:15.32 --> 00:28:23.96 Hmm is if you go if you like to shoot weapons still oh yeah and you want to go shooting you have to pay for ammunition
00:28:25.16 --> 00:28:33.56 I'm serious I remember times in the seal teams where I mean your your thumbs are getting your thumbs are literally
00:28:33.56 --> 00:28:39.64 Getting sore from reloading magazines for days and days you're shooting all the all the bullets you could possibly
00:28:39.80 --> 00:28:44.60 Ever ever want to shoot ever you're gonna shoot them all in a week or two weeks
00:28:44.60 --> 00:28:48.04 And so it's it's so fun. Yeah, it's so fun
00:28:49.32 --> 00:28:53.64 And you know for us and for those of you don't know see you go through a work up prior going on deployment
00:28:53.64 --> 00:28:57.08 Which is now you're working together for the first time this is when I'm getting to know you guys
00:28:57.08 --> 00:29:02.28 You guys are getting to know me we're all getting to know each other where the whole the whole unit is coming together as a team
00:29:02.28 --> 00:29:08.48 And this is where the real bond forms and you're doing super hard training
00:29:08.48 --> 00:29:13.28 You're you're living together you're working out together you're working together
00:29:13.28 --> 00:29:17.56 You're partying together you're eating your meals together. It's just a 24-7 rock and roll
00:29:17.84 --> 00:29:24.08 Awesome this and and that's how that's how it that's how you get to know these guys that's how you get to know your
00:29:25.52 --> 00:29:31.84 Your your team. Yep, so me Mikey and another guy were the we're the new guys in that
00:29:31.84 --> 00:29:36.24 Platoon one other guy. He saw an act of duty. Yeah, yeah
00:29:36.24 --> 00:29:43.76 I'm just saying there was only three new guys in that platoon. Yeah, yeah, yeah, and our and and and and and Delta and Delta. Yeah
00:29:45.20 --> 00:29:49.04 Needless to say Delta and Charlie were of slightly different dynamic
00:29:49.84 --> 00:29:52.08 Yeah, you guys were you guys are a different dynamic
00:29:53.20 --> 00:29:59.44 Different just like people have different personalities full tunes have different personalities and teams have different personalities and they can more from change
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.36 but
00:30:01.36 --> 00:30:03.04 Nonetheless
00:30:03.04 --> 00:30:03.84 Both great
00:30:03.84 --> 00:30:11.04 Pltunes both yeah, oh yeah, and so it was only you and Mikey in one of the guys. Yeah, I know who the other guy was. Yeah
00:30:12.16 --> 00:30:17.04 The tick you guys were only only three new guys. Yeah, yep, so it's can be a harsh
00:30:18.64 --> 00:30:24.08 It's it's it's a harsh environment to come into when you're when you're a new guy
00:30:24.08 --> 00:30:29.84 I see up to but I saw him with so I'm with Mikey and we're doing we're just I don't even think we're doing mobility
00:30:29.84 --> 00:30:32.48 but we are driving out to the ranges and
00:30:32.48 --> 00:30:37.12 He's the uh he's the turk on right and
00:30:38.96 --> 00:30:42.16 I say something to him like hey when we're approaching a road, you know
00:30:42.80 --> 00:30:47.12 You look at your field of fire and if there's no vehicles coming you know say clear right
00:30:48.40 --> 00:30:53.60 And so he did it once and he's clear right you know kind of quiet now's like hey man
00:30:54.32 --> 00:30:58.80 You got to sound off the drivers try to drive he's got it. He's got radio on he's he needs to know what's going on man
00:30:58.80 --> 00:31:03.44 You need to sound off yeah and the next in her second got to he's a
00:31:04.16 --> 00:31:08.64 Right he said it super loud and I thought to myself wait a second is he is he
00:31:09.68 --> 00:31:15.28 You know taking a piss out of me is he is he being sarcastic with that yell right no and no
00:31:15.28 --> 00:31:21.44 He was not no I told me yell he was like okay we right I will yell I will yell and that's that's the way it worked
00:31:21.44 --> 00:31:29.20 Did the other one of my other favorite stories about Mikey was and his another like new guy related story was
00:31:29.68 --> 00:31:31.68 So you go through
00:31:32.16 --> 00:31:35.28 CQC training close quarter combat close quarter battle
00:31:35.76 --> 00:31:37.44 Whatever it's basically shooting in small
00:31:38.16 --> 00:31:41.92 Spaces taking down buildings that kind of thing and it's it's a
00:31:43.68 --> 00:31:45.44 There's there's a lot of
00:31:45.44 --> 00:31:53.76 Instructor focus oh yeah on the mechanics of what you're doing so it's a very it's a very mechanical thing and if you if you're making mistakes
00:31:53.76 --> 00:31:56.80 It's not gonna work out good for you and by the way as a new guy
00:31:56.80 --> 00:32:00.56 There's tough scrutiny but the reality is it doesn't matter if you're new or not like they're watching
00:32:00.56 --> 00:32:03.76 We have everybody's getting watched you could be a third-platoon guy and get
00:32:04.24 --> 00:32:08.96 Can from the platoon first-a-fifth evaluation and you get a safety evaluation in two seconds. He's not there in you know half a second
00:32:08.96 --> 00:32:13.92 Yeah, it doesn't take much so and and what they're trying to do is they're trying to put more stress on you right
00:32:13.92 --> 00:32:19.28 Because they want them they want you to handle the stress so they stress people out by just
00:32:19.68 --> 00:32:25.44 You know these little minute details of what you do right around and they'll be honest with you
00:32:25.84 --> 00:32:31.04 Some of them no matter some of you're like okay, that doesn't matter you and and I know they don't matter because they they more
00:32:31.04 --> 00:32:33.04 Over time and they'll teach you know
00:32:33.12 --> 00:32:34.16 ones
00:32:34.16 --> 00:32:39.76 Phase they'll be teaching one thing and then if later they'll teach the phase they'll teach another thing then later they'll teach another thing
00:32:39.76 --> 00:32:41.28 So it's not
00:32:41.28 --> 00:32:43.28 There's a million different ways to do yeah and
00:32:44.96 --> 00:32:48.000 You could argue this one's better, but there's a million different ways to do it
00:32:48.32 --> 00:32:53.54 But they do they pick whatever they're gonna choose for that block of training is what you're gonna do and
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.48 And if you want to sit there and argue with them
00:32:56.48 --> 00:32:58.72 Oh boy there's not gonna work out good for you
00:32:58.72 --> 00:33:01.88 So what I told all the new guys and Delta and Charlie Ptune I said well, hey listen
00:33:02.24 --> 00:33:09.48 When the instructor cadre is telling you to do something or they're yelling at you or they're getting on your ass about something you just look at him and say Roger that
00:33:09.48 --> 00:33:11.48 Oh
00:33:11.48 --> 00:33:16.20 You guys got it Roger that and these guys are like Roger that and that's the one that it's you want to have right?
00:33:16.20 --> 00:33:17.88 Because what do you want what do you want to be a new guy?
00:33:17.88 --> 00:33:24.52 That's like hey, no, I don't agree with your tactics there person. That's deployed you know overseas 14 times no you don't want to be that guy
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.28 You might think you're right, but no, this is what you know, that's not what you want to do
00:33:28.28 --> 00:33:33.000 So I told you guys to say Roger that so we're going through the training the training great and we're
00:33:33.56 --> 00:33:38.000 Doing really well our task units doing great. You know, but still guys are guys are making mistakes
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:45.76 Whatever and finally the master chief and I'm of course for like Tony and I were friends with all the cadre guys because they're all our bros from being in teams and
00:33:47.36 --> 00:33:49.36 One of the the leader guy
00:33:49.36 --> 00:33:51.36 He comes up to me and he's like hey
00:33:52.28 --> 00:33:54.28 He's hard, but yes guys
00:33:54.28 --> 00:33:56.000 He goes hey
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.58 What's up with this guy monster and I was like I don't what what do you mean? What's up? He's been doing a good job. What's up? He goes every time I tell him something
00:34:02.58 --> 00:34:04.58 All he does just look at me and say Roger that
00:34:04.58 --> 00:34:10.50 Yeah, I go hey brother, you know what he's doing exactly what I told you
00:34:10.50 --> 00:34:15.50 I literally told them the only thing I wanted him to say to you guys or want anything you guys to say to you guys
00:34:15.50 --> 00:34:18.78 Was Roger that and make an app so when we were out there there was
00:34:19.34 --> 00:34:24.50 Another platoon that was there at the same time. Do you remember this they were in and I
00:34:25.06 --> 00:34:33.22 I'm pretty sure the chief got canned from a platoon. Yeah, he saved you violation and there was some and there was that talking back going on right like hey
00:34:33.22 --> 00:34:38.82 I've got three deployments under my belt and you know, there's a degree of humility in that Roger that response right
00:34:38.82 --> 00:34:43.14 That's what it's like it's it's Roger that. I'm open to the correction you have for me
00:34:43.14 --> 00:34:45.54 Yeah, for sure and so and these guys
00:34:45.54 --> 00:34:50.90 You know him's on the platoon and there's a balance there. I mean he's leading us platoon and taking a stand for you know
00:34:50.90 --> 00:34:56.18 And being in charge put the same time like there's a humility and a respect in that response and he was not doing that
00:34:56.18 --> 00:34:57.54 And I'm telling you like he
00:34:57.54 --> 00:35:04.10 Screwed some things up and they saved you review board. I remember about holding a safety review board for the chief of that platoon
00:35:04.10 --> 00:35:11.02 Yeah, not our task unit, but it did they do not play around no and and that's the way it's supposed to be right because it's intense
00:35:11.02 --> 00:35:15.86 And what people don't get is that you're trying to recreate the intensity of combat as best you can
00:35:15.86 --> 00:35:21.98 So they're creating high stress situations as stressful as possible and like you said sometimes creating
00:35:21.98 --> 00:35:28.30 Elements that aren't necessarily real, but just to overload you with a number of things you have to process under pressure
00:35:28.30 --> 00:35:33.18 And then are you gonna make good decisions under pressure and that right there is what
00:35:33.90 --> 00:35:39.34 Translates to combat good decisions under stress and under pressure. Yeah, yeah, and
00:35:40.70 --> 00:35:42.94 You're right though about that humility piece and
00:35:43.66 --> 00:35:48.90 That was all attitude going through right you know what I mean between me Tony
00:35:48.90 --> 00:35:53.54 I don't think there was I'm just trying to think if there's any instructor cadre that was putting us through
00:35:54.18 --> 00:35:56.72 Right, you know, I get there was some guys that were it's you know
00:35:56.72 --> 00:36:01.46 And the stupid was it wasn't like there was someone that was just you know had tons more experience than the two of us
00:36:01.46 --> 00:36:03.46 Right and
00:36:03.46 --> 00:36:08.50 Yeah, we you know both Tony and I hit Roger that yeah, hey sounds good will will make that adjustment because
00:36:08.74 --> 00:36:13.14 You know what and it's great just having Tony on the other day. He was just saying look
00:36:13.14 --> 00:36:19.54 You can I'm learning something new all the time learning something from the new guys, and that's the attitude that prevailed through the task
00:36:19.54 --> 00:36:21.54 You know not of hey
00:36:21.78 --> 00:36:26.58 Where the best we don't have to listen to anybody, but hey, we're gonna work as hard as we can
00:36:27.14 --> 00:36:31.62 We're gonna be the best we can, but we're we got open minds that we're ready to learn at all times
00:36:31.62 --> 00:36:36.14 It's a fine line between confident and cocky no doubt about and and being humble
00:36:36.14 --> 00:36:42.50 You can be confident you can be sure and you can be humble and respectful and open to learning new things and maybe based a present which you learn
00:36:42.50 --> 00:36:44.50 Yeah, there's no doubt about that so
00:36:45.70 --> 00:36:47.70 What else do you remember from
00:36:48.70 --> 00:36:54.98 Work up in terms of hey you're a new guy you're checking in you know Tony and I told some stories of what it was like when we were checking in team one
00:36:54.98 --> 00:36:57.74 It was when we were new guys it was a very
00:36:58.58 --> 00:37:04.38 Ruff environment to roll right into yeah, what did you think when you got to you know being a new guy? Well
00:37:05.58 --> 00:37:11.30 I remember like literally day first of all day one that I was checking into the platoon space
00:37:11.30 --> 00:37:15.82 I got like the combo to the platoon space right now went in and I'm man brand new and
00:37:16.26 --> 00:37:20.36 So I'm gonna be protective of my platoon you know, so I go in I'm walking out of the platoon space
00:37:20.36 --> 00:37:26.38 Making sure the door is locked behind me because you know other platoon guys go in and just destroy another guy's platoon space
00:37:26.38 --> 00:37:30.70 forever and I'm walking down the hallway and our LPO
00:37:31.38 --> 00:37:37.58 Who is goes down to the door and he doesn't have the combo right you go see goes hey, hey, what's the combo to the space?
00:37:37.58 --> 00:37:38.58 I'm like
00:37:38.58 --> 00:37:44.18 I gave him some wise ask you do you not know him? No, it didn't know him yet, right? How that worked out?
00:37:44.18 --> 00:37:47.70 It was hilarious like he he goes hey, what's the combo to the space?
00:37:47.70 --> 00:37:51.74 I'm like hey, man, I can't give that to you and I didn't know he was the LPO
00:37:52.26 --> 00:37:57.92 He's he's he's he's he's he's on the goddamn LPO. What's the fucking combo to the platoon space like
00:37:57.92 --> 00:38:02.78 Roger that he's pretty well three one together been two you know and I proceeded to walk down the steps
00:38:02.78 --> 00:38:03.78 I'm like oh
00:38:03.78 --> 00:38:05.78 God almighty. Why?
00:38:05.78 --> 00:38:09.80 And the team just I just met the LPO and it was not on good terms
00:38:10.50 --> 00:38:13.70 Man, that's all and then he and I turned out to be good friends, but
00:38:14.86 --> 00:38:19.12 I remember we're out doing land warfare training and this is like where you know you're cutting the metal like you said
00:38:19.12 --> 00:38:22.06 You're getting to know each other and you know the guys in the platoon
00:38:22.06 --> 00:38:25.70 Also trying to figure out what these new guys like all right, what have I what have we got here?
00:38:25.70 --> 00:38:27.70 What can we rely on you know and
00:38:28.26 --> 00:38:29.94 so
00:38:29.94 --> 00:38:33.58 One night ever remember us doing a little bit of boxing and it was
00:38:33.58 --> 00:38:36.86 forced boxing new guy on new guy
00:38:37.58 --> 00:38:39.58 You know and
00:38:39.58 --> 00:38:44.50 Survival of the fittest oh man. Yeah, dude. And then and then at times it was just
00:38:45.22 --> 00:38:47.38 three on you know
00:38:47.38 --> 00:38:53.62 Every man for himself and it's just like your heads on a swivel and it's Mikey the tick and me and we're just
00:38:53.90 --> 00:38:56.70 Wailing away and it's just going and it's hey
00:38:57.10 --> 00:39:02.98 Who's gonna continue to fight basically right and you'd oh everything you know I'm an officer in these two guys
00:39:02.98 --> 00:39:05.10 Or just you know obviously well in a way, but I'm like hey man
00:39:05.10 --> 00:39:11.28 I'm gonna just fight to the bitter end and it was it was pretty awesome. Hey did you do your jits who before you got
00:39:11.68 --> 00:39:13.68 I do had just enough
00:39:13.68 --> 00:39:20.70 I didn't to make it that you could hold your own. I would when I would do the officer cumin this. Yes
00:39:20.70 --> 00:39:23.70 I did do some and you know to keep in mind like
00:39:23.70 --> 00:39:31.82 Did you train on the East Coast when I was in high school and I got in I got into greasy jutsu like literally like I was already training
00:39:31.82 --> 00:39:39.94 When the first UFC ever me him out right and so it was pretty cool and then that was always a big shocker for people
00:39:40.14 --> 00:39:43.78 Because you were you were by far smaller than the other
00:39:44.18 --> 00:39:49.22 Platoon officers and yet you had that you jits who had the jutsu and when you have the jutsu
00:39:49.22 --> 00:39:52.86 You didn't have a lot either. What were you even up to the belt? I don't even know
00:39:52.86 --> 00:39:55.78 Yeah, you were probably like a high level white belt
00:39:55.90 --> 00:40:01.26 But but to be fair like at the time it was all very new like the world of MMA today is oh
00:40:01.26 --> 00:40:05.90 Yeah, totally different totally different as you know, but at the time like I mean
00:40:05.90 --> 00:40:10.02 I even went to in high school with my with my instructor who is it who's a teacher at my school
00:40:10.02 --> 00:40:13.72 He was into it. So he and I would train like five in the morning before school
00:40:13.72 --> 00:40:19.66 Me versus him much larger man, but we learned it just and then we went and did seminars with hoist gracing
00:40:20.38 --> 00:40:25.46 In upstate New York we would drive and it was cool. I got to get out of school. I'm going right again
00:40:25.46 --> 00:40:27.10 This is just proof
00:40:27.10 --> 00:40:32.58 That you jutsu so good because he would I would make these these officers like we meet at five o'clock in the morning
00:40:32.58 --> 00:40:37.46 And I say okay, and I would train with everybody, but then I say okay now you to you to fight to the death
00:40:38.90 --> 00:40:42.72 And then we just get after but he but he was he was 150 pounds
00:40:42.72 --> 00:40:47.42 He's going against guys that are 200 pounds. You know they have him by 50 pounds and taller
00:40:47.42 --> 00:40:49.90 And taller and and you would just you know there's
00:40:50.50 --> 00:40:53.74 You know it just doesn't work. You know you got to know that you did too
00:40:53.74 --> 00:40:59.46 Yeah, and I'm not gonna say that I wait in these are tough guys. No, no, no, that's right. That's right
00:40:59.46 --> 00:41:02.22 Like they weren't tapping me out. You know, didn't you usually tap them?
00:41:02.54 --> 00:41:06.58 I used to choke down a certain guy who didn't like that very much
00:41:07.74 --> 00:41:09.74 It's all right
00:41:09.74 --> 00:41:15.30 Yeah, but you know and the thing at that time because they're bigger than me was more about energy conservation
00:41:15.30 --> 00:41:19.42 Right and so like I mean I just let him wear themselves out and then they try and get things on me
00:41:19.42 --> 00:41:21.42 And then I just snake my way around there. But he
00:41:21.42 --> 00:41:24.90 Also remember you've all been tearing for the taste
00:41:24.90 --> 00:41:26.90 Oh
00:41:26.90 --> 00:41:32.78 So you actually had an attitude like you had you look like I can hit my handle this like no factor
00:41:32.78 --> 00:41:36.76 What you want to taste me bring it that's right. You know you don't see the guys on cops
00:41:37.26 --> 00:41:44.10 When there's a big tough crazy guy all on PCP and he gets tasty rips the taste around and throws the thing and he just keeps coming
00:41:44.10 --> 00:41:46.10 That's what Andrew Paul had that look
00:41:46.54 --> 00:41:48.54 Like I'm gonna
00:41:48.54 --> 00:41:53.58 Just go you gonna taste me bring it. Let's go. I mean hey. I'm a new guy in the pool to and right
00:41:53.58 --> 00:41:59.34 I mean I got to earn my spot right and so some somewhere somebody had actually was the LPO
00:41:59.34 --> 00:42:04.90 He had he had one of these things. Yeah, and I was like oh and I'm gonna tell you what like it had these like two modes
00:42:04.90 --> 00:42:07.46 And one where you could shoot or you could like put it right up to the guy
00:42:07.46 --> 00:42:13.36 You know and I was like hey, let's go shoot him. He's like we got my like come on. Let's go and then like the whole pool tune
00:42:13.36 --> 00:42:15.92 Like everybody like met down in the back cave and
00:42:15.92 --> 00:42:18.48 There may be a video floating around somewhere
00:42:19.28 --> 00:42:24.30 This one had the winter barbs that those against no-to-teaser as I like the bar like the winter bars
00:42:24.30 --> 00:42:27.30 Our longer to get through this weather
00:42:27.30 --> 00:42:34.66 Who that down coat yeah, and so when of course he was like what were you in a t-shirt or just no shirt?
00:42:34.66 --> 00:42:39.80 I was in a t-shirt. Yeah, and I was like oh, how those winter barbs work out for you?
00:42:39.80 --> 00:42:45.92 So it's like there's like all they're getting ready to do it. Oh wait wait, and you know these are my guys looking out for me
00:42:45.92 --> 00:42:49.64 I appreciate it guys. They're like oh, we're here. Here put this eye pro one. Oh, that's a good idea
00:42:50.20 --> 00:42:54.44 Right, so put some eye pro on and then like like it's got a laser on it, right?
00:42:54.44 --> 00:43:00.04 So the laser him and you if you see the video like like you hear guys going like guys are witnessing like nobody's been
00:43:00.04 --> 00:43:02.50 T-he's like nobody else was gonna happen right now, right boom
00:43:02.50 --> 00:43:08.56 So this thing comes out at like 45 degree angle in one like goes into my sternum and the other one
00:43:08.56 --> 00:43:19.26 Goes below my belly button. All right, so my instantly over all that all that thinking he was just gonna just rip those things out
00:43:19.26 --> 00:43:27.64 He went ridge and thank God we put a mat down. Yes, there was a man because he went ridge straight and fell like a brick
00:43:27.64 --> 00:43:28.92 Yeah, boom
00:43:28.92 --> 00:43:35.36 Nothing and then just so it so clearly and I remember this too like it hits you and like it hits you in that in that spot
00:43:35.36 --> 00:43:40.78 And like your hands go to grab like you've been stung you've been hit so your hands my hands get like three quarters of the way there
00:43:40.90 --> 00:43:43.44 By the time the electricity freezes the body
00:43:43.44 --> 00:43:48.46 So my hands are kind of like stuck in front of my chest in my admin as it attempted to grab this spot
00:43:48.74 --> 00:43:50.24 So I go over and
00:43:50.24 --> 00:43:55.96 All right, they turn the thing off and then they go to get these things out somebody's got a pair of pliers and in the barbed
00:43:55.96 --> 00:44:04.28 I remember that you know it's good when you need pliers that much to dislodge the show like it went into the muscle like because like I remember
00:44:04.28 --> 00:44:10.48 ripping and coming free but not free and it was but it was still beneath the skin and
00:44:11.20 --> 00:44:13.20 And then it just like just rip it
00:44:13.76 --> 00:44:18.76 This is the team's bad. This is what makes the team so far. Yeah, one day you show up at work
00:44:18.96 --> 00:44:25.22 You're just volunteer to get taste and you're gonna get some the best thing you can do is just volunteer in a situation like that
00:44:25.22 --> 00:44:30.48 Yeah, you know and just like I come on. Let's go. Yeah, brilliant and then they got oh, okay, right on, you know
00:44:30.48 --> 00:44:36.000 Yeah, well, you did the right thing. I'm sorry. I didn't work out through work. I think work down great
00:44:37.76 --> 00:44:40.000 All right, so we get word
00:44:41.16 --> 00:44:44.000 We get done with our work up and now it's time to go on deployment and
00:44:45.84 --> 00:44:48.32 Get on deployment and we found out
00:44:49.12 --> 00:44:55.06 What two weeks before you guys were on leave when we found out we were going to Ramadi instead of where we originally supposed to go
00:44:55.06 --> 00:44:58.68 Which was and I rack but we knew I mean I knew Ramadi was gonna be the
00:44:58.68 --> 00:45:00.68 The the best place to deploy to and
00:45:03.66 --> 00:45:06.36 We show up over there and what was cool. I thought about
00:45:07.16 --> 00:45:15.44 With with that deployment is the way we task organized and every basically every leader got their own element
00:45:15.44 --> 00:45:20.08 Yeah, yeah, and put you guys it was like, oh, yeah, you know how you've been working for this and we've been all but no
00:45:20.08 --> 00:45:24.88 You're going out on your own your your in charge. Yeah, and that was that was awesome and that
00:45:24.88 --> 00:45:30.46 What made me feel good was that when we were in the work up and we made you guys run operations even though
00:45:30.46 --> 00:45:36.24 You were new guys and made you put you in pressure situations and put you in charge of ground force commander while you were
00:45:36.80 --> 00:45:42.34 You know most troops didn't do that right but I knew that there was a possibility and furthermore
00:45:42.64 --> 00:45:47.44 What happens if you know your platoon commander gets killed what happens if I get killed and then you're the guy
00:45:47.44 --> 00:45:52.76 Yeah, then you got to be able to step up and run stuff and so we did that through the chain of command and and we did
00:45:52.76 --> 00:45:57.40 I will admit to this we made sure that we had crushed the work up
00:45:58.28 --> 00:46:02.96 And then it was like okay, we've dominated okay now we start training the new guys up on how to lead and that was
00:46:02.96 --> 00:46:07.04 Yeah, that was important too because it's you want to do well in the workup
00:46:07.04 --> 00:46:12.14 You want you because that's where your reputation as a task when it comes from is how well you do going through these various training
00:46:12.14 --> 00:46:17.84 Well, that's why we earned earned the spot to be able to go to Iraq right because the thing is is that some guys are going elsewhere
00:46:17.84 --> 00:46:24.64 And you're all vying look I mean you're all vying because you want to go to combat and some guys are going someplace else not in Iraq and
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.16 You know, I hate to say it, but that's not where any of us really wanted to go
00:46:29.16 --> 00:46:32.76 Oh nothing to say about that if you're in the seal teams you want to go to war
00:46:32.76 --> 00:46:37.20 That's right we all wanted to go to war. That's what we were fighting for we were competing
00:46:37.20 --> 00:46:42.000 There's three task units we were competing as a task unit to get top spot to the most dangerous place
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.44 And that's what we want to go and that's right out to be a body now by the way
00:46:45.44 --> 00:46:50.72 On that workout to just from a leadership perspective. I don't know if you remember you know not everybody made it through the workout
00:46:51.44 --> 00:46:53.44 There were guys who were cut loose
00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:00.24 Safety issues not stepping up not leading right pushing that leadership opportunity down to the junior officer whatever and not stepping up
00:47:00.24 --> 00:47:03.76 We're doing something unsafe or just not having what it took and
00:47:04.88 --> 00:47:06.08 You know and
00:47:06.08 --> 00:47:08.16 You know just from a leadership perspective you have to be
00:47:08.88 --> 00:47:11.12 willing to make that hard decision and
00:47:11.12 --> 00:47:17.36 Reality and I know you know you only have talked about it when you've given everybody that guy every opportunity when you've evaluated it
00:47:17.36 --> 00:47:20.24 And you've kept notes and you've tried to train and you've tried to correct
00:47:20.88 --> 00:47:22.88 It's not a hard decision right
00:47:23.28 --> 00:47:28.72 Yeah, actually the common or I don't know if you were there but the common or asked me we were on deployment
00:47:28.72 --> 00:47:32.06 And he goes you know hey, hey, chocolate. This is in front of everyone. He says you know
00:47:32.40 --> 00:47:34.32 Well, I shouldn't say everyone's in front of a leadership
00:47:34.32 --> 00:47:39.68 He says hey how are the guys that weren't in work up maybe weren't performing up to par how are they doing over here?
00:47:39.68 --> 00:47:46.40 And I was like sir, they're not in this task. They're not here. That's right. Yeah, they did make it. Yeah, right? They've been removed. That's right
00:47:46.64 --> 00:47:49.44 So yeah, that's a great point and again
00:47:49.60 --> 00:47:52.16 It's hard thing to do because you because you really
00:47:53.04 --> 00:47:59.36 You're really wrecking someone's life. Well think about it, right? So this is a guy who is who so there's a guy who's an officer
00:47:59.92 --> 00:48:02.52 Right, so I mean we didn't really kind of glaze through it
00:48:02.52 --> 00:48:05.84 But it's hard to get a spot to go to buddha's an officer. Yeah, it's very competitive
00:48:05.84 --> 00:48:11.44 So this is a guy who's an officer who got a spot to go to buddha's made it through buds which is hard
00:48:13.12 --> 00:48:19.92 Made it through SKT got to a pulltune this this guy is not a slouch physically. You know what I mean like this is not this is not
00:48:20.64 --> 00:48:27.52 some loser, you know, this is a guy who made great American right patriotic. That's right. That's right. That's right. Great guy
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.84 Who stepped up who made it through something that many many other men could not make it through and
00:48:33.84 --> 00:48:35.84 And had to make a hard decision
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:45.52 You know on your part with the Delta Patoon commander to not have this guy continue with us and so if that can happen even within the seal teams
00:48:45.52 --> 00:48:47.44 So it goes because they were listening right? I mean
00:48:47.76 --> 00:48:52.16 Don't you think that's also possible that within your organization you might have to make a similar kind of decision
00:48:53.04 --> 00:48:58.08 We also have to make that decision in the seal teams. We're not exempt from making that decision
00:48:58.24 --> 00:49:00.88 Yeah, and also very much like the civilian sector
00:49:00.88 --> 00:49:02.88 You know
00:49:03.20 --> 00:49:07.44 There's HR basically in the military there's HR. There's there's human resource department
00:49:07.44 --> 00:49:10.64 You can't just walk into animal like this guy on the fire. That's right. No, okay. Well
00:49:11.04 --> 00:49:13.92 What have you counseled them has you paper work on him?
00:49:13.92 --> 00:49:17.36 That does he know that? Dave you verbally have you written it? It's all these things. That's right
00:49:17.36 --> 00:49:21.28 He went through that whole procedure. Yeah, and you know if there's an extreme case of course
00:49:21.28 --> 00:49:26.56 You can you can make it happen, but it's gonna cost you a little bit of political capital because honestly if I'm your boss
00:49:26.56 --> 00:49:29.52 And you come to me and say hey, I want to fire this guy and I say okay. Why?
00:49:29.52 --> 00:49:35.36 Well, I don't I don't you know he's not doing his job anymore and I say okay did you counsel? No, not yet, but I want to fire him anyways
00:49:35.52 --> 00:49:39.12 That's gonna cost you some political capital. Yeah, I'm actually looking you're going away second
00:49:39.12 --> 00:49:42.88 Why didn't you train this guy? Yeah, you as a leader. Why didn't you step up and train this guy? What what are you doing?
00:49:42.88 --> 00:49:46.96 Because it cuz that can be a cop out right hey if I'm too lazy to train mentor
00:49:47.36 --> 00:49:52.64 Then you're copying you out as leader, but if you've done all those things as a leader and you can really document that and see that and they guys
00:49:52.64 --> 00:49:56.16 Still not performing then the next leadership decision is toned-up
00:49:56.16 --> 00:50:02.64 Partway and that really is I mean that really is one of the the best things about the seal teams is is when you're raising your guys up
00:50:02.64 --> 00:50:07.84 When you're when you're teaching guys what you know and you're saying hey, man, this what you need to do hey
00:50:08.40 --> 00:50:11.76 Bro, here's what here's the way this works here's what you did over here. Here's what you should do
00:50:11.76 --> 00:50:14.80 You know that's just that's your that's your legacy
00:50:14.80 --> 00:50:19.68 That's what you leave behind is is hey this is what I learned and I want to teach you to as many guys as I can
00:50:19.68 --> 00:50:22.72 That's what you're trying to do so if you're alive you're not doing that
00:50:22.72 --> 00:50:29.84 That's jacked up, you know, that's jacked up and it's the same thing in the civilian sector. You know here's a good one
00:50:30.72 --> 00:50:36.16 I was working on we work with companies and I was working on the company the other day and they got a guy who sort of
00:50:37.36 --> 00:50:39.36 You know, oh well well
00:50:39.52 --> 00:50:46.40 Maybe he's not the best mentor right but he wants to get promoted of course because everyone wants to
00:50:46.96 --> 00:50:51.84 So this guy wants to get promoted and they're trying to they haven't had luck saying look you got to be a mentor
00:50:51.84 --> 00:50:58.000 You got to lead you got to be a better leader. You got to braze people up and I just you know talk talk to the boss
00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.28 And I said well ask him this question. Yeah, you know what I definitely am looking forward to promoting you
00:51:03.28 --> 00:51:06.72 Give me the three names of people that you've prepared to take your position right
00:51:07.92 --> 00:51:13.28 Goose eggs right. It's gonna be goose eggs cuz yeah, isn't done that that's right so that's a key component
00:51:13.28 --> 00:51:15.28 You know you definitely want to
00:51:15.52 --> 00:51:21.04 You want to be as a leader you should be looking for your replacement all the time and I with with with with lathe
00:51:21.04 --> 00:51:26.64 With a delta to a commander. I want to those guys build do my job and that's my whole goal and I wanted you to be able to do my job right
00:51:26.64 --> 00:51:30.16 And I'll tell you by the time we went on to play me. They everyone pretty much could do my job
00:51:31.04 --> 00:51:35.36 So that that was success for me because guess what that allowed me to do on to play me
00:51:35.92 --> 00:51:39.84 Look at the look up and look out and figure out what we're gonna do next and all that other stuff
00:51:40.16 --> 00:51:43.84 So that should be your goal from a leadership perspective for sure and
00:51:44.16 --> 00:51:48.72 As you just pointed out when you get to a situation where you've done the coaching you've done the mentoring
00:51:48.72 --> 00:51:53.44 You've done the counseling you've written you've set the expectation you have a person that's still isn't caught in the monster
00:51:53.76 --> 00:51:56.72 You gotta go not a hard decision and you have to be loyal
00:51:57.20 --> 00:51:59.44 People get mixed up too because there's a loyalty component
00:51:59.44 --> 00:52:03.84 Hey, cuz you formed those relationships. We just talked about an hour about this big relationship with all these people
00:52:03.84 --> 00:52:06.80 Well guess what you ever relationship with that person that you're about to fire too
00:52:07.36 --> 00:52:09.36 But then the question becomes
00:52:09.36 --> 00:52:13.28 Are you gonna be loyal to that individual you may loyal to the team because you're hurting the side
00:52:13.28 --> 00:52:15.28 Yeah, that's exactly right. It's the team. Yep
00:52:15.28 --> 00:52:18.96 So that's that we went on to plan with a strong bunch of
00:52:19.68 --> 00:52:21.68 Pipeters all right
00:52:22.64 --> 00:52:28.72 So we get on to plan and we you you guys we kind of and this is again this is something Tony and I talk about we were
00:52:29.20 --> 00:52:34.24 Task organized and we changed that we changed it on a fairly regular base. Okay. We know what we this area is getting hot
00:52:34.24 --> 00:52:39.28 Need more guys over there and we would just kind of there's a lot to do there's a lot to do there's a lot of work to be done
00:52:39.28 --> 00:52:41.28 There was a lot a lot of bad guys
00:52:41.28 --> 00:52:43.28 Um
00:52:43.68 --> 00:52:50.80 When you when you look back and you're kind of so now you're on your first combat deployment what was the thing that struck you as?
00:52:52.40 --> 00:52:57.44 Damn like okay, this is what cuz I'll tell you people asked me that and I'm like the first firefight
00:52:57.44 --> 00:53:01.76 I got in while my first deployment to Iraq and honestly I was like okay
00:53:01.76 --> 00:53:07.12 I felt like I was 100% prepared. I agree completely and I was like okay cool. Hey guys
00:53:07.12 --> 00:53:13.12 You know, he's just very simple very straightforward. So some guys said to me one time and this is an outside guy and
00:53:13.76 --> 00:53:16.16 Said because it kind of seems to me that in the tiltings he guys do
00:53:16.88 --> 00:53:23.52 Stress in evacuation really well and so I would say yes because that's that was exactly my same first firefight
00:53:23.52 --> 00:53:25.52 I got in I was like
00:53:25.52 --> 00:53:30.40 No, but deal and you know look you know when the rounds are close right like you know what that sounds like and
00:53:30.80 --> 00:53:34.000 They're and they're really close and it's no big deal by the way
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:37.84 It's not really very loud when they're shooting at you right I mean you hear certain sounds
00:53:38.88 --> 00:53:44.48 But then of course he's fire maneuvering. It's a little bit loud, but that's awesome. It's just like every drill we've ever done and it was no big deal
00:53:44.48 --> 00:53:46.08 It was just
00:53:46.08 --> 00:53:53.88 It was almost habit at that point you can you exactly the number so no big deal the first the first time I went out in a humbany
00:53:54.72 --> 00:53:58.40 In Ramadi so keep in mind like you said on the introduction we got there
00:53:58.40 --> 00:54:06.80 Guys were getting IED and killed every single day every day the message traffic came over and it was
00:54:07.20 --> 00:54:09.20 KIA you know
00:54:09.20 --> 00:54:10.20 IED
00:54:10.20 --> 00:54:11.20 So
00:54:11.20 --> 00:54:12.80 first home the
00:54:12.80 --> 00:54:18.000 Rada go out in and I'm looking out the window and by the way like you can't really roll these windows down
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.12 It's not like you can you don't want to roll these windows down by the way
00:54:21.12 --> 00:54:24.48 All the proof windows right you want to keep them up right and you know
00:54:24.48 --> 00:54:30.64 So like you actually can't shoot back if you want to right the only guy who can shoot back is your turret gunner and
00:54:32.16 --> 00:54:35.28 For the first like I would just say minute and a half I was like
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.44 Wencing I was like waiting for this clock to go
00:54:40.16 --> 00:54:42.80 You know and then finally I was like you know what
00:54:43.28 --> 00:54:50.64 There's nothing I can do about it and I literally let it go right then so that was like that's a strong memory like I remember
00:54:50.64 --> 00:54:54.64 Even for all the training and again the first firefight was no big deal and
00:54:55.36 --> 00:54:59.60 But driving down in a home the sitting in the back completely helpless
00:54:59.60 --> 00:55:04.52 I mean you have two choices and life is a lot like this you can sit there and worry yourself away about it
00:55:04.52 --> 00:55:09.12 Whoa is it this intersection is it this intersector or just go you know what here's a deal
00:55:09.12 --> 00:55:12.84 I can't control it so I'm just gonna be ready so it went my time to bust out this door or do whatever
00:55:12.84 --> 00:55:14.72 We got to do it to do the media action drill or whatever
00:55:14.96 --> 00:55:20.24 I'm ready to do it and the rest of it you just let go you let go because anything else is not effective
00:55:20.24 --> 00:55:24.32 Yeah, you're not you're not yet it's not only just are you worried
00:55:24.32 --> 00:55:26.32 But now you're you're actually doing things bad
00:55:26.32 --> 00:55:31.52 You're actually being negative you're thinking about things that you shouldn't be thinking about and it's not helping you
00:55:31.52 --> 00:55:35.84 It's not helping your team so I like that just to just to kind of sum up what you said
00:55:36.08 --> 00:55:40.000 You were in Ramadi for six months. You were scared for about a minute and 30 seconds
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000 Yeah, and after that I
00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.20 And I think that's the attitude that I
00:55:45.20 --> 00:55:50.24 Think that's the best I hate I don't know if this is the right thing to say or not but
00:55:50.88 --> 00:55:55.20 To accept the fact there's things you can't control that you cannot control and
00:55:55.68 --> 00:55:59.12 That one of those things is you know an ID a sniper bullet
00:55:59.12 --> 00:56:04.24 Yeah, I mean, and now there's things that you can do to influence because guess what we do training
00:56:04.24 --> 00:56:06.40 We prepare we're keeping our eyes peeled
00:56:06.40 --> 00:56:09.84 We're taking routes that we know have been cleared to the best of our ability
00:56:09.84 --> 00:56:12.64 We're we're we're on the street we're moving we're moving to cover cover
00:56:12.64 --> 00:56:15.52 We're doing everything that we can but guess what it doesn't matter
00:56:15.52 --> 00:56:19.36 You can do everything right and doesn't matter. You can still get blown up. You can still get shot
00:56:19.60 --> 00:56:23.92 That's the way it is so if you sit around and just think about that all the time
00:56:24.24 --> 00:56:28.88 It's just gonna drive you crazy one and number two is gonna make you do your job worse
00:56:29.04 --> 00:56:31.52 Yeah, because you're gonna be less aggressive and I think
00:56:33.20 --> 00:56:37.44 You gotta stay aggressive to stay alive you you want to be aggressive you want to be you know what yeah
00:56:37.44 --> 00:56:39.04 We'll go to make that happen. Oh
00:56:39.04 --> 00:56:42.80 They're they're I do I want to sit in the vehicle right now or get out and get out and get some ground
00:56:42.80 --> 00:56:46.80 I mean that's just the type of thing that's mindset. It's a mindset that that wins
00:56:46.80 --> 00:56:51.76 That's it. It's the winning mindset and if your goals to win then you have to recognize
00:56:51.76 --> 00:56:56.56 That certain thought processes are not effective and they take away from your ability to win
00:56:56.56 --> 00:56:59.52 And you know I see people get worried about stuff that kind of thing, right? So
00:57:00.24 --> 00:57:04.56 You just you take us to value I want to win right the guy said me one time hey
00:57:04.56 --> 00:57:08.64 Do you think do you think fear is a is a useful
00:57:09.76 --> 00:57:15.28 Emotion I thought about for a second. I've never lots of different people talk about fear and you know this and that and you know
00:57:15.28 --> 00:57:17.28 I would say for
00:57:17.44 --> 00:57:21.04 Maybe I'll change this one day, but right now. This is where I've come to on fear
00:57:21.84 --> 00:57:28.08 Maybe for the caveman who's walking through the jungle and they get attacked by the Sabre two tiger and that fear that
00:57:28.08 --> 00:57:35.28 Fidr flight response is enough to make him react in a moment in order to avoid being slashed by the tiger
00:57:35.68 --> 00:57:42.72 But other than that fear was not effective in battle because you do not make good decisions when acting in fear
00:57:43.12 --> 00:57:50.40 And you have a better chance of survival you make better decisions and you have a better chance of winning and defeating and crushing the enemy when you were main calm
00:57:50.80 --> 00:57:52.80 You do do do do do do do right?
00:57:52.80 --> 00:57:59.60 Observe oriented side act. Yeah, yeah, I get asked to I obviously get asked about fear a lot and you know
00:57:59.60 --> 00:58:00.96 I would say look
00:58:00.96 --> 00:58:05.36 Fear is that there's not a bad thing because it's the thing that makes you go. Okay. I need to be ready
00:58:05.68 --> 00:58:09.36 Right is the thing that makes you worse. It's the thing that makes you say okay because you and for me
00:58:10.64 --> 00:58:16.72 The again the fear wasn't about the fear of get killed getting blown up the fear was always about
00:58:16.72 --> 00:58:22.32 I want to I don't want to do a bad job. I don't want to make a bad decision that I'll tell you your leadership position
00:58:22.80 --> 00:58:29.04 That is the heaviest fear that you have is I make a mistake my team does something that doesn't
00:58:29.76 --> 00:58:31.76 doesn't
00:58:31.76 --> 00:58:38.88 Bring credit upon us as a union by that. I mean doesn't do a good job like you're just I don't even know where that comes from
00:58:38.88 --> 00:58:42.16 It's just want to do a good job and the fear is hey
00:58:42.16 --> 00:58:47.76 I hope I don't do anything that gets my guys hurt or killed. I hope doing anything that's a bad decision that makes that does that hurts
00:58:47.76 --> 00:58:50.64 us strategically as a nation. Yeah, those are the two
00:58:51.20 --> 00:58:57.12 fears that I think make your hurts make you practice make you reinforce make you
00:58:58.48 --> 00:59:01.68 Aware of what's happening, but you can't what you can't do
00:59:02.32 --> 00:59:08.88 I mean for me fear fear is makes me aggressive like oh I think this guy's gonna gonna do something to me cool
00:59:08.88 --> 00:59:12.96 I'm afraid of him call me to attack him. I'm gonna kill him. You know I'm gonna take him out. I'm gonna do something
00:59:13.20 --> 00:59:16.08 You know and I actually see that time and you know I see that name in me too
00:59:16.48 --> 00:59:21.68 Where when you see someone happen to somebody where they get a little bit they get a little bit rocked or something
00:59:23.04 --> 00:59:29.28 If they if they let that fear make them back off and go into a defensive mode it's exactly what you just said
00:59:29.28 --> 00:59:34.96 If it makes you into a defensive mode, it's good you're gonna the person's gonna because man you can smell that that's right
00:59:34.96 --> 00:59:39.28 You can smell that so when I think the reaction to fear is like oh I'm afraid right now
00:59:39.28 --> 00:59:43.20 COVID attack I have to attack yeah like oh I don't feel comfortable about where the
00:59:43.44 --> 00:59:46.000 Troop is moving right now or where my squad is moving right now
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.84 I don't think it's a good thing cool. I'm gonna attack him to take some high ground. I'm gonna maneuver that's
00:59:50.32 --> 00:59:56.08 What's healthy yes, it's healthy fear that that's healthy, but you're also trained and prepared mentally for that kind of thing
00:59:56.08 --> 01:00:01.12 Most people when they start acting in fear they start making poor decisions. Yeah, yeah, so so in that sense
01:00:01.12 --> 01:00:05.04 It's like hey get over your fears because you have to recognize when you're acting in fear
01:00:05.12 --> 01:00:10.64 You'll have a less desirable outcome than if you can get over it calm down sip you know observable or into sidacto
01:00:10.64 --> 01:00:12.64 No doubt about it
01:00:12.64 --> 01:00:17.76 All right, what about what about just plain leadership challenges? I mean here we are just a stressful deployment
01:00:17.76 --> 01:00:19.76 Yep, it was
01:00:19.76 --> 01:00:24.000 It was the most stressful deployment that anybody had had up until that point in Iraq
01:00:26.40 --> 01:00:30.80 And even talking to you know the Vietnam guys this was a stressful deployment
01:00:30.80 --> 01:00:38.16 Yeah, a very stressful deployment in the amount of combat that was happening. Well urban combat happen it's happening so fast
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.20 So but from a leadership perspective what did you was there anything that you didn't expect was there any lesson that got confirmed?
01:00:48.48 --> 01:00:53.04 Yeah, so in its funny because you know over time in the deployment
01:00:54.16 --> 01:00:56.16 You really mature
01:00:56.16 --> 01:01:03.20 Even in a short amount of time and I'll give you a quick quick story so it was one of my last ops before I left country
01:01:03.76 --> 01:01:08.64 And there was another unit that had come into kind of partner up with us and
01:01:09.68 --> 01:01:13.60 We went into this op and so the officer in that you know who's a good friend of mine by the way
01:01:14.88 --> 01:01:20.32 Was it might have been his second combat op, right? And so I've been on I don't even know how many at that point
01:01:20.32 --> 01:01:28.88 And so we went into this operation and it involves some army units and so we're sitting in this position and
01:01:30.16 --> 01:01:32.16 So
01:01:32.40 --> 01:01:39.68 Like classic blunder the army guy who's sitting there is on the rooftop and he's smoking a cigarette
01:01:40.24 --> 01:01:46.64 Like like the classic world war to sniper victim smoke in a cigarette
01:01:47.36 --> 01:01:49.36 Trail smoke going up
01:01:49.36 --> 01:01:53.12 And I mean this is classic I mean single sniper shot
01:01:54.56 --> 01:01:59.04 Shoot them and it it just I mean it misses his face
01:01:59.84 --> 01:02:01.92 Well, I'm gonna put this way it took his ear a little off
01:02:02.48 --> 01:02:09.76 Right around cracks into the wall behind us. That's it immediately everybody just by like just unloads firefight
01:02:09.76 --> 01:02:11.12 Right and
01:02:11.12 --> 01:02:15.20 So we're calling it met it after this guy because it kind of it still cut him pretty good and
01:02:15.20 --> 01:02:17.20 And
01:02:17.20 --> 01:02:21.44 Trying to figure out through the meeting more fire whatever the situation is so so this guy is like well
01:02:22.24 --> 01:02:24.24 on my case so
01:02:24.32 --> 01:02:28.64 Time to call it you are often get out here. It's like well, you know, I think I'm like feet think what dude
01:02:29.36 --> 01:02:34.64 What else do you think is possibly gonna come from this and you know? I mean I probably
01:02:35.52 --> 01:02:38.80 Would have thought hey, maybe we could still get something from this it was my first or second
01:02:38.80 --> 01:02:40.88 Right, but it was just clear like I mean at this point
01:02:40.88 --> 01:02:44.000 I mean we've already we've already got a lot of guys hurt on this deployment
01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000 We've already lost Mark and
01:02:46.64 --> 01:02:49.92 If you have a guy, so you know, they'll just already been shot at this point so
01:02:52.80 --> 01:02:59.92 You have to weigh like what what more are you gonna gain? I mean first of all this guy just this sniper just got a bead on this guy
01:02:59.92 --> 01:03:03.44 I mean in by the grace of God he is still alive and
01:03:04.24 --> 01:03:06.24 We've shot like so
01:03:06.48 --> 01:03:10.96 What else is gonna happen? I mean they're either just gonna set up and get a better position or get another shot
01:03:10.96 --> 01:03:17.04 But they certainly aren't gonna do anything we certainly aren't gonna see anything that they don't want us to see at this point
01:03:17.04 --> 01:03:22.000 So the battlefield is lost. I mean this op is it's over. It's it's time to pull shocks and go
01:03:22.24 --> 01:03:25.92 So anyway that already came and busted down this wall with the fighting go who's awesome?
01:03:25.92 --> 01:03:27.92 I mean I love the fighting Bradley fighting you whole
01:03:28.48 --> 01:03:32.32 But you know that should sort of like a quick it's like obvious it's obvious to me at that point
01:03:32.32 --> 01:03:36.72 And I don't mind anymore in comp you know quarterback 10 years later as I'm explaining this like
01:03:36.72 --> 01:03:41.44 Anyways, we'll see you can go well. Yeah, obviously time to go right, but you know what you're in that position and guys
01:03:41.44 --> 01:03:44.000 They're still trying to get after it and there's still things going on out there
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000 You might think well, maybe there's still something we can do here
01:03:47.20 --> 01:03:49.20 Yeah, and by the way, but
01:03:49.20 --> 01:03:56.32 There was other times where similar situations happen in different decisions were made and they worked out great. Yep, you know and so
01:03:57.84 --> 01:03:59.84 I think you're overall
01:03:59.84 --> 01:04:06.16 Statement is like you gained perspective right over time and you're able to look at things from a
01:04:06.72 --> 01:04:11.20 From a better perspective and from a higher altitude from a lack of a better way to say
01:04:11.20 --> 01:04:14.96 You'll understand what's happening on the battlefield more. You know that's definitely
01:04:15.76 --> 01:04:19.44 Something that if people are listening and it's something that they want to become aware
01:04:19.44 --> 01:04:21.28 It's it's something that you can actually act on
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.04 because
01:04:23.04 --> 01:04:25.04 that perspective
01:04:25.04 --> 01:04:28.16 It can be gained through time and experience
01:04:28.16 --> 01:04:30.16 But it can also be gained by
01:04:30.40 --> 01:04:35.76 Detachment and saying okay, what am I really doing here right now? Yeah, what are we really going to gain?
01:04:36.32 --> 01:04:43.28 And you can make a faster progress down the line to have to make good judgment calls based on
01:04:43.76 --> 01:04:48.56 Not just experience, but just on knowledge and and trying to capture the right perspective at the right time
01:04:48.72 --> 01:04:50.56 plus a big tactic for those guys
01:04:50.56 --> 01:04:53.44 It was slowly developing and and happened
01:04:53.92 --> 01:04:55.28 after we left
01:04:55.28 --> 01:05:03.52 So is there anything else that you start that that you learned again that you didn't expect or that was useful for you
01:05:06.72 --> 01:05:12.80 From a leadership perspective yeah, so you know I found myself in a position a lot of times of
01:05:13.44 --> 01:05:18.40 Kind of stitching the people keeping it put to and stitch together, you know because in an intense situation
01:05:18.72 --> 01:05:21.20 I start to have different opinions about things, you know
01:05:21.76 --> 01:05:24.000 They do indeed yeah and so
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000 So
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:30.64 On this deployment I was not the puttune commander right my good friend was the puttune commander and
01:05:31.36 --> 01:05:37.76 When you're in a position leadership you're making a lot of hard decisions and not everybody always agrees with the decision that gets made
01:05:38.32 --> 01:05:47.12 And so a lot of times the role I needed to fill was to back my puttune commander and continue to keep the puttune together behind puttune commander
01:05:47.12 --> 01:05:49.52 because he he had he was tasked with making some hard decisions
01:05:49.52 --> 01:05:51.52 So
01:05:52.88 --> 01:05:56.88 Sometimes it was you know some you know, so look I would just the analogy I would give to you is that
01:05:57.36 --> 01:06:04.000 You may be in a role in a company in an organization where the best thing you can do to be part of the team is to
01:06:05.04 --> 01:06:08.56 Help keep the team on focus for the mission and that might mean
01:06:09.36 --> 01:06:13.04 You know spend some time with one or two guys who are over here
01:06:13.04 --> 01:06:22.000 Have it disagreeing about the decision or which way things are going and truly one of the best ways that you end up having to do that or doing that
01:06:22.40 --> 01:06:26.80 Is number one you build the relationships with the guys right so they know and trust you number two
01:06:27.68 --> 01:06:29.68 year-potune commander is
01:06:29.92 --> 01:06:36.40 Got a lot of stuff on his plate right and so one of the easiest things for him to
01:06:37.12 --> 01:06:39.12 Cut short is
01:06:39.12 --> 01:06:44.64 The guys of of explaining hey here's why this is going on here's how why this gonna so you as the intermedia
01:06:44.64 --> 01:06:46.08 You're saying okay, I know what he's doing
01:06:46.08 --> 01:06:48.56 I know he's making this isn't let me explain this down the chain of command
01:06:48.56 --> 01:06:55.44 That's right and that's so helpful and so helpful and when you got guys in the puttune or any organization a high performing organization
01:06:55.84 --> 01:07:01.32 That are really strong-willed and have strong opinions and by the way are an intelligent and it can make really
01:07:01.32 --> 01:07:03.52 Articular points as to why they don't agree with something
01:07:04.32 --> 01:07:07.76 You know again my role in that in that situation
01:07:07.76 --> 01:07:14.40 Was to ensure that mission success continued to happen that we were still effective as a unit and that meant me
01:07:14.64 --> 01:07:22.64 Kind of behind the scenes trying to keep keep some guys on board. Yeah, and it's interesting. I'm sure people have noted this already but
01:07:23.68 --> 01:07:26.08 When you said there's these different people inside of a puttune
01:07:26.08 --> 01:07:33.04 I mean just if you listen to the podcast that I just were did with retired senior chief Tony of fratty and you
01:07:33.04 --> 01:07:39.92 You guys personalities are are very very different very very different and that's just some of what you get in a suit
01:07:39.92 --> 01:07:44.68 To and you know what it's not just some what getting a suit to it's some of what you get in any
01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.28 Organization that's right there's no clones. There's not people being turned out
01:07:49.84 --> 01:07:52.72 They can have the same background they can go to the same school
01:07:52.72 --> 01:07:55.36 They can have the same level experience they can be totally different people
01:07:55.36 --> 01:07:58.24 That's the way it is and that's the way it isn't the seal teams and that's the way it is in every organization
01:07:58.24 --> 01:08:01.68 Part of why we're so good right because you get guys that think differently. You have problems differently
01:08:01.68 --> 01:08:08.88 Yes, but I like the fact of what you're saying is you had to be you found yourself in the role of
01:08:09.12 --> 01:08:12.72 Okay, you know what I'm going to make sure that the guys understand where the puttune commanders coming from
01:08:13.12 --> 01:08:16.16 Would the got that if there's something that actually makes sense?
01:08:16.16 --> 01:08:18.80 I'm going to bring it back to puttune commander and say look this isn't one of the guys
01:08:18.96 --> 01:08:22.72 You know complaining about something here's the legitimate point that's being made right
01:08:23.12 --> 01:08:26.96 And then you guys can have that the such discussion maybe brings in one of those guys
01:08:26.96 --> 01:08:31.68 And we'll tell me what you're talking about here and then you guys can move forward and come up with a best possible plan
01:08:32.16 --> 01:08:40.88 But yeah as a peacemaker for all practical purposes is is what's is where you what you end up being and
01:08:42.08 --> 01:08:44.48 You know before what the one other
01:08:46.56 --> 01:08:51.12 Peas makers needed because there wasn't a lot of peace over there not a lot of peace
01:08:51.84 --> 01:08:53.84 And one of the stories I think that
01:08:53.84 --> 01:09:02.40 That little Mikey story here that kind of shows you the level of violence that was happening in Ramadi
01:09:03.44 --> 01:09:05.44 so I
01:09:05.44 --> 01:09:07.44 Came to visit
01:09:07.68 --> 01:09:11.92 Because I was on the other side of Ramadi and the guys from Delta
01:09:12.96 --> 01:09:19.76 First a small section of guys from Delta and then all of them ended up on the on the eastern side of Ramadi with the first the five last six band of brothers
01:09:19.76 --> 01:09:23.76 Awesome outstanding unit amazing
01:09:24.56 --> 01:09:26.56 guys to a man and
01:09:27.20 --> 01:09:32.48 With an amazing commander, but so Delta tuned ended up over there well anyways
01:09:33.04 --> 01:09:37.44 I'd gone over to to visit go go do some ops with them and see what's going on and
01:09:38.08 --> 01:09:44.24 When I showed up you know, I showed up and and this was a few is probably like a month and a half in
01:09:44.24 --> 01:09:48.64 Uh because the guys had taken over some crappy
01:09:50.08 --> 01:09:52.08 Building and
01:09:52.08 --> 01:09:55.44 Full metal jacket and had built it out FMJ
01:09:55.84 --> 01:10:02.64 So if you guys seen the movie full metal jacket that's a scene in the movie where these guys these buildings are all blown out well this building where
01:10:03.68 --> 01:10:06.40 Not not just the seals, but a bunch of guys army guys
01:10:06.96 --> 01:10:10.24 Lived in this building and it was all blown out and it looked like this awesome
01:10:10.24 --> 01:10:12.24 It was awesome
01:10:12.56 --> 01:10:17.60 When we first got in there the first one we first went out there it was dirt it was literally dirt floors
01:10:17.60 --> 01:10:21.20 Just mosquitoes everywhere. It was totally it was just horrible and
01:10:22.16 --> 01:10:27.04 Now sometime had passed and the guys of course you put seal somewhere. They're gonna dial some stuff in
01:10:27.04 --> 01:10:34.32 You see the CBS that we have this CBS we are my gosh the CBS we had were phenomenal and we don't know what CBS are
01:10:34.32 --> 01:10:37.76 They're sort of the Navy's version of engineers and
01:10:37.76 --> 01:10:44.88 They're they're fanatically hard workers and the crew that we had with us in our body that was that was we they were part of our tasking
01:10:44.88 --> 01:10:46.88 It they were just
01:10:46.88 --> 01:10:53.60 Total hard chargers and bus their ass and make stuff happen. So they had and the other thing the other thing you have to do in your
01:10:53.60 --> 01:10:57.84 Cb is you have to learn to acquire things because there's a lack of things
01:10:58.40 --> 01:11:04.16 In combat zone and so you're good CB can come up with let's call it you know
01:11:04.16 --> 01:11:10.96 120 sheets of 4 by 8 plywood right that our master or CB master. She's awesome
01:11:11.28 --> 01:11:17.12 We got there do they had they had these racks built out for us in this balloon out concrete building
01:11:17.28 --> 01:11:18.80 That had like shells
01:11:18.80 --> 01:11:25.76 Yeah, stairs to go to the upper and do it was awesome. Yeah, so they take they that's what they've done is taken and just built the like into these
01:11:25.76 --> 01:11:27.76 Basically small plywood condominium
01:11:29.76 --> 01:11:31.76 And I
01:11:31.76 --> 01:11:33.76 Showed up there one time and
01:11:34.40 --> 01:11:40.08 You know, we're hanging out and you know the two commanders give me a little debrief on stuff and just kind of telling me how things are going
01:11:40.08 --> 01:11:43.44 And then someone says hey, did you see Mikey's video?
01:11:43.92 --> 01:11:50.24 And I go I go no and I go go see Mikey's video and so I go okay
01:11:50.24 --> 01:11:53.12 So they go his runs back there and what does room say on it? Oh
01:11:53.12 --> 01:11:57.68 Like Mikey's palace. Yeah, so I'm gonna grace story about Mikey's palace by the way
01:11:57.68 --> 01:11:58.68 So go ahead
01:11:58.68 --> 01:12:02.12 So I'm like he's so so the so the CB's have built these awesome
01:12:02.92 --> 01:12:04.92 plywood paradise for us and
01:12:05.80 --> 01:12:12.12 So you know people sleep we could sleep all different times right I mean daytime night time whatever because the obstacle was so intense and so
01:12:12.12 --> 01:12:15.80 Everything was totally blacked out and I got like an odd sleeping style like I can
01:12:16.60 --> 01:12:19.96 Well as a mole rat you know we have slightly different
01:12:20.52 --> 01:12:22.52 Cycle so
01:12:22.52 --> 01:12:26.28 Mikey had a different cycle like everybody would be asleep and I would be awake
01:12:26.28 --> 01:12:34.44 I'm back I always could find Mikey awake and Mike so you go in you go in he was on the ground floor and so you go down and it was pitch black
01:12:34.44 --> 01:12:40.92 And you have like feel your way through it all these bumps and then you go down around this corner down this hallway and you make a sharp right
01:12:41.48 --> 01:12:47.32 And and then there would be this faint and glow coming from Mike's palace and so Mikey's bunk was
01:12:47.64 --> 01:12:52.52 The last one up against the wall and there was like an extra like three feet between his bunk and the wall just the way that I
01:12:52.52 --> 01:12:58.36 Wait worked out and so he had like these tapestries that his family had sent him hanging from the wall and
01:12:58.92 --> 01:13:03.80 And he'd have like poncho liners all hung out blocking the whole thing out and so it was all dark
01:13:03.80 --> 01:13:11.56 It was like his little cave and you go back in there and I don't know where he got him be like extra pillows on his bunk and like he had his laptop like
01:13:12.12 --> 01:13:13.48 Like rigged that's like a
01:13:13.64 --> 01:13:17.88 TV screen if you always be watching movies and he always had all kinds of gaitunk back
01:13:17.88 --> 01:13:23.08 So I go back in there and I go in and glow for Mikey's palace I go back in there and we just said
01:13:23.08 --> 01:13:29.64 Hey man you want some of these have beef jerky that's so does he'd have like romans romony rules and he'd always had
01:13:29.64 --> 01:13:32.60 He had like this heating element like once like you plug into the wall
01:13:32.60 --> 01:13:36.52 He'd like hey man and yeah cook up the heating element boiling water right there
01:13:36.52 --> 01:13:40.84 Or some ramen I could have ever I was hungry in the middle and I'd I could get down there to Mikey's palace
01:13:40.84 --> 01:13:46.52 I knew I could get some grub and he night hang out and watch movies and stuff and he's always up weird hours like man
01:13:46.52 --> 01:13:49.88 And it was just cool man. He had just yeah, he was cool pictures
01:13:50.28 --> 01:13:52.28 Postures hanging on the wall. He had that thing
01:13:52.84 --> 01:13:54.84 Fricked out
01:13:54.84 --> 01:13:59.000 Yeah, so these guys are like hey, have you seen Mikey's movie and I go no
01:13:59.24 --> 01:14:04.68 So I go we'll go back to Mikey's palace and check it out and so I make my way back to our same
01:14:04.68 --> 01:14:09.64 They either you make your way back through the dark at the head lamp on even though it's noon or something right out outside
01:14:09.64 --> 01:14:12.36 But the place is blocked out anyway as I get back there and
01:14:12.36 --> 01:14:17.000 And I'm like Mikey and and he didn't know I was
01:14:17.88 --> 01:14:25.000 That I was at correct or you know, so he was just you know, you know kind of like hopped to or whatever in a very
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.84 I don't want to make that sound too extreme, you know, but he was surprised to see the command
01:14:30.20 --> 01:14:34.92 But um anyways, I'm like Mikey. He's like oh, he's like hey, you know when they saw chill and I said
01:14:34.92 --> 01:14:38.44 Hey, let me see your movie man and he gets a smile on his face. I go okay
01:14:38.44 --> 01:14:43.72 This must be interesting so anyways he breaks out his camera. He's showing me the movie on the camera right
01:14:43.72 --> 01:14:46.92 But it's got volume and I'm sitting and watching it anyways the movie is
01:14:47.80 --> 01:14:53.000 It's a big firefight going on. It's just there's this is a big bad firefight
01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.76 There's machine gun fire going off and he's literally sticking his hand up with the camera above
01:14:59.32 --> 01:15:03.24 And you have a roof top and he's filming when you can see stuff getting shot whatever and
01:15:03.24 --> 01:15:10.44 And then the funny part is he brings the camera down. He's you know hiding in this rooftop and he points the camera out himself
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.56 And the area of Ramadi that they were working in was a place called the Malab district and
01:15:16.60 --> 01:15:22.60 Like many things in the military it had taken on its own little life. It's own little legend the Malab district and
01:15:23.56 --> 01:15:27.88 Mikey points the camera out himself and he says it's the moolab
01:15:27.88 --> 01:15:32.52 Oh, baby and so it was really funny and
01:15:33.96 --> 01:15:36.28 And I get done watching this and of course, I'm still you know
01:15:36.92 --> 01:15:40.92 Mr. Big bad jacco and and I get done watching it. I go I go hey Mikey
01:15:41.56 --> 01:15:42.76 Listen bro
01:15:42.76 --> 01:15:45.64 When you're out there you shouldn't be filming stuff you need to be on your gun
01:15:45.64 --> 01:15:47.88 I mean that's just that's just what you need to be doing
01:15:47.88 --> 01:15:52.36 You need to get on your gun and and you need to keep shooting you need to put an ounce press and fire
01:15:52.92 --> 01:15:56.52 And he and he looks at me. He's kind of sheepishly you know because he felt bad he goes
01:15:56.52 --> 01:15:58.52 He goes
01:15:58.52 --> 01:15:59.52 He's like hey sir
01:15:59.72 --> 01:16:01.72 I was out at ammo
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:10.04 Yeah, I started laughing because that's probably 800 rounds maybe maybe more probably 121 probably 12
01:16:10.04 --> 01:16:15.56 100 yeah just a massive amount of machine gun rounds that he had gone through and he had shot them all
01:16:15.56 --> 01:16:20.20 That's what windchester means means you'd shot you had nothing left and he said you know
01:16:20.20 --> 01:16:22.76 Sir, I sorry sir. I was I was windchester
01:16:22.76 --> 01:16:31.08 I just started laughing. I was like well if you windchester makes a good movie. I guess my brother. He got after yeah, so that's uh another good
01:16:31.40 --> 01:16:33.40 Mikey story
01:16:33.40 --> 01:16:35.40 so
01:16:36.04 --> 01:16:38.04 You actually ended up going home
01:16:38.52 --> 01:16:40.52 early from deployment
01:16:40.52 --> 01:16:45.32 Yep, and because you had another kid on the way. Yep, Gunner
01:16:46.60 --> 01:16:48.04 He
01:16:48.04 --> 01:16:55.56 Ending thing is is it's like got him in hindsight to 2020 man, you know when when man when this stuff goes like this
01:16:58.28 --> 01:16:59.56 Mm
01:16:59.56 --> 01:17:03.000 We had point we knew that that was gonna be the end of the deployment
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.60 And so it was like all right cool, you know you just go back with the with the ad on for the reapply
01:17:07.56 --> 01:17:09.56 And so that was all part of the plan
01:17:09.56 --> 01:17:11.56 From day one basically. All right cool
01:17:11.56 --> 01:17:14.60 Um because my first son had been born on my last deployment
01:17:14.92 --> 01:17:16.92 so as it was
01:17:16.92 --> 01:17:20.44 And and by the way so it started heading back what gives birth early anyway
01:17:20.76 --> 01:17:23.88 So there you go two deployments two kids not there
01:17:23.88 --> 01:17:25.64 Common story for a lot of military guys
01:17:25.64 --> 01:17:29.64 But people who are not you know, I mean imagine I cannot be in there for you or for either of your kids
01:17:29.64 --> 01:17:32.12 Well, why if she's a trooper, but she was running out of steam
01:17:33.24 --> 01:17:36.20 So it was cool to be able to go back and at least try to be there
01:17:36.68 --> 01:17:38.36 But Gunner's always been in a hurry
01:17:38.36 --> 01:17:42.20 So he came early um and then so yeah went back
01:17:42.20 --> 01:17:47.16 Um, start handling the redeploy and survive that he means we're
01:17:48.36 --> 01:17:53.08 Some guy comes home from deployment a little bit early to start basically preparing for us to come home
01:17:53.56 --> 01:17:58.04 Getting ready for all the administrative stuff that's gonna take place and Andrew was that guy
01:17:58.52 --> 01:18:03.40 And there's like that happened and then there was like three other guys it like a week later came the holiday too
01:18:03.40 --> 01:18:04.76 So it was you know
01:18:04.76 --> 01:18:08.20 Near the end, but it tough but it tough call anyway and then
01:18:08.20 --> 01:18:15.72 I mean I remember where I was when when I got the word so you know, I was back at the team and
01:18:16.12 --> 01:18:18.12 I was I was actually
01:18:18.28 --> 01:18:20.60 chatting with Delta Patin commander
01:18:22.36 --> 01:18:29.56 The method that we use and he I'm so I knew they were going out and and I mean I just think they remember going all right
01:18:29.56 --> 01:18:33.96 It gets some for me, you know, and so I was home. I got the call at like
01:18:35.40 --> 01:18:37.40 12 30 at night
01:18:37.40 --> 01:18:39.40 Our time local and
01:18:39.40 --> 01:18:41.64 So I knew right away that was one of our guys
01:18:42.44 --> 01:18:45.72 They went you know nothing over the you know over the phone specifically
01:18:45.72 --> 01:18:51.40 But I knew because I had just talked to our guys, you know, and I was like got on my so I right raced into
01:18:52.36 --> 01:18:57.56 So you get the call that just says come to work. Yeah get to work kind of like all right so and
01:18:58.92 --> 01:19:04.76 Admittedly I'm a little frantic, you know because these are my brothers, you know, and I'm not there
01:19:04.76 --> 01:19:06.76 That's really hard
01:19:07.16 --> 01:19:09.16 So
01:19:11.40 --> 01:19:14.68 You know you can have some survivors guilt over that kind of thing. Yeah
01:19:16.52 --> 01:19:20.68 You know what seems like hey look we got this deployments basically over
01:19:21.48 --> 01:19:25.80 And go back thinking you're making a right decision trying to balance
01:19:26.36 --> 01:19:28.36 Stuff with your family
01:19:28.36 --> 01:19:32.20 And then for that to happen and you know
01:19:32.20 --> 01:19:37.000 He's one of my guys he's one of my guys and I wasn't there and
01:19:38.04 --> 01:19:40.04 And that's hard
01:19:40.04 --> 01:19:45.56 You know, it's been almost 10 years now and time helps to heal those kinds of things
01:19:46.12 --> 01:19:48.12 But I had a lot of guilt over that and
01:19:48.44 --> 01:19:54.12 And so anyway, we kind of figure out what's going on. I get the brief and figure out who it is
01:19:55.48 --> 01:19:56.52 So
01:19:56.52 --> 01:20:01.40 Start figuring out okay, so now it's now it's a race for those of you that don't know I mean look here's a thing
01:20:01.40 --> 01:20:09.64 We live in a 24 seven news world and it's a race to notify the family before they find out for some other means and
01:20:10.36 --> 01:20:14.76 He lives up in Orange County so we started assembling a team and you know
01:20:17.96 --> 01:20:19.96 Admirals and
01:20:20.60 --> 01:20:22.60 Commodore's are involved and
01:20:23.32 --> 01:20:24.84 It look
01:20:24.84 --> 01:20:30.28 This is the second guy that we have not lost seals on our act to this point mark and Mike now so
01:20:30.28 --> 01:20:32.28 um
01:20:33.16 --> 01:20:37.72 You know, it's who's gonna go to the notification and I mean like I had to like dig my heels in I was like listen
01:20:37.72 --> 01:20:39.08 This is my guy
01:20:39.08 --> 01:20:40.68 I'm going and
01:20:40.68 --> 01:20:43.80 It was at first like and then it was like no, no, no
01:20:44.28 --> 01:20:45.48 I'm going and
01:20:45.88 --> 01:20:49.48 Thank God I did that because I mean I wouldn't had it in the other way
01:20:50.04 --> 01:20:53.72 We're racing we put put the guys together throw the blues on we drive it up and
01:20:54.20 --> 01:20:57.48 You know look when we got to my key's family's house
01:20:57.48 --> 01:21:03.96 You know look at all they wanted was to talk to somebody who knew Mikey and the other four guys that were standing there
01:21:04.12 --> 01:21:08.20 Didn't know didn't serve with them didn't work up with them didn't deploy with them and
01:21:08.84 --> 01:21:11.80 You know in this grand scheme of God's plan
01:21:11.80 --> 01:21:17.40 I have to ask you know we pulled over before pulling up the uh pulling up to the house and put on our blues
01:21:17.40 --> 01:21:19.40 And I literally thought to myself okay
01:21:20.36 --> 01:21:24.92 That we are about to give the worst possible news to a to a parent
01:21:24.92 --> 01:21:29.72 Better kids that and I remember thinking you know
01:21:30.20 --> 01:21:32.20 God just used me right now
01:21:32.20 --> 01:21:35.40 I don't know why I'm here in this timing
01:21:36.92 --> 01:21:39.88 But just work work through me just use me you know
01:21:40.28 --> 01:21:43.08 So you know we knocked on their door and and
01:21:43.96 --> 01:21:47.96 You know Mrs. Montzure looked out and she later knew you know that we
01:21:48.84 --> 01:21:53.08 I mean she took a few minutes to get to the door she looked out and saw five minutes standing there and blues
01:21:53.08 --> 01:22:01.08 So that was very hard you know you go in and obviously families upset and you're doing the best you can to keep it together
01:22:01.08 --> 01:22:09.40 I mean for me this was my guy this was my brother and I'm standing there given them the news and trying to keep it together myself and
01:22:11.32 --> 01:22:12.52 You know the
01:22:12.52 --> 01:22:17.48 The good news is is that one by one they sort of looked around and said well do anybody know Mikey and I was like
01:22:17.88 --> 01:22:20.36 Yeah, I knew Mikey he used mine and
01:22:20.36 --> 01:22:23.48 So they you know playfully asked everybody to leave
01:22:23.88 --> 01:22:30.20 But wanted me to stay and just talk about the deployment tell stories about Mikey what he was like what was going on
01:22:31.16 --> 01:22:33.16 and you know I want to
01:22:36.76 --> 01:22:43.000 The Montzure's are an unbelievable family and I totally want to respect their privacy
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000 That's right family
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:53.96 And they're just they just been so amazingly humble and gracious through this whole thing and I just don't want to
01:22:54.76 --> 01:22:59.64 Sit here and tell stories about about this right I don't want to do it
01:23:05.96 --> 01:23:11.56 One of the things that the the only the only thing I'll say about this again out of
01:23:11.56 --> 01:23:14.52 Just respect for the Montzure family
01:23:16.44 --> 01:23:19.80 Is when you just said about about
01:23:21.80 --> 01:23:26.12 You tell them what deployment was like well in talking to them
01:23:27.24 --> 01:23:29.24 one of the things that
01:23:29.24 --> 01:23:30.84 they said
01:23:30.84 --> 01:23:32.36 was
01:23:32.36 --> 01:23:33.88 We're
01:23:33.88 --> 01:23:41.48 Impression of the deployment so so like I said and you guys have heard stories about Ramadi and you could go and you can go on YouTube and just put Ramadi 2000s
01:23:41.48 --> 01:23:43.08 Yeah, you'll see what Ramadi was like
01:23:44.12 --> 01:23:46.36 That's what Ramadi was like and it was
01:23:47.56 --> 01:23:51.48 Incredibly violent and crazy and these guys
01:23:53.08 --> 01:24:00.28 Charlie and everything were in the thick of it in the thick of it on a almost daily basis
01:24:00.28 --> 01:24:07.24 And the reason I'm building that up is because the emails that Mike had sent home to his family
01:24:08.12 --> 01:24:12.76 Were oh yeah, I haven't fun not much going on here right don't worry about me
01:24:12.76 --> 01:24:18.36 We're just training some Iraqis don't worry about me. Oh, we're just we're just trying to work on the infrastructure
01:24:18.36 --> 01:24:23.32 Don't worry about me. It's all good here. I'll be home in a little bit though those are kind of emails
01:24:23.96 --> 01:24:29.48 That he was sending home in order to make sure that his family wasn't worried about right and
01:24:29.48 --> 01:24:32.52 It shows you what kind of a guy that Mike he was
01:24:35.80 --> 01:24:37.80 So so
01:24:39.08 --> 01:24:42.76 Any is there anything else again without without going into
01:24:43.88 --> 01:24:45.40 Your personal
01:24:45.40 --> 01:24:49.96 You know your personal interactions with this incredible family
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.52 That you want to say and maybe from the perspective of
01:24:54.52 --> 01:25:00.92 As much as I hate to say this there's gonna be other people that are gonna do this job
01:25:01.40 --> 01:25:03.40 Being this person that does the notification
01:25:04.68 --> 01:25:11.000 Is there anything else that you could give advice to people that have to do this job or you know
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.20 If they if that ever be falls people that I mean we get a lot
01:25:14.84 --> 01:25:22.04 Andrew we get a lot of big lot of military guys that that reach out to me all the time that are active duty that are doing it up to work and
01:25:22.04 --> 01:25:24.04 And
01:25:24.04 --> 01:25:27.32 Anything that strikes you is something that you learned from this experience
01:25:28.44 --> 01:25:31.08 Here's what I learned is the worst thing I've ever done in my life and
01:25:32.36 --> 01:25:34.36 The worst thing and
01:25:35.08 --> 01:25:40.04 Combat itself was a piece of cake compared to this. I would love to go back to combat
01:25:40.84 --> 01:25:41.80 Any
01:25:41.80 --> 01:25:46.84 Issues or concerns or anything from my military service was completely centered around this
01:25:46.84 --> 01:25:52.36 He is an extremely heavy burden to bear so if you're ever in this position. I don't have any good advice for you
01:25:52.44 --> 01:25:58.44 There's nothing you can do to prepare yourself for this type of situation the only thing I could tell you is
01:25:59.72 --> 01:26:05.08 Reach out to guys who've done it before I will gladly talk you through it because one of the best
01:26:05.56 --> 01:26:11.08 Salves that I've found for this kind of pain is hanging out with your brothers and spending time with them
01:26:11.72 --> 01:26:14.84 I will always have time for someone who's had that be a cake. Oh always
01:26:14.84 --> 01:26:20.68 Call me. Let's go out. Let's hang out. I won't suggest drinking a beer, but if it appears what you want to do will do it
01:26:21.16 --> 01:26:27.000 But the bottom line is is that just the intimacy of being around another guy who's been there is very comforting
01:26:27.56 --> 01:26:32.28 And so you know when you go through a stressful situation like this do not isolate yourself
01:26:32.84 --> 01:26:34.84 There are other guys who have been through this and
01:26:36.36 --> 01:26:41.88 And a true brother will be will be willing to take the time for you. I'll find a time for you no matter what no matter how busy I am
01:26:41.88 --> 01:26:46.36 And so I just want to be a resource now. I know that there's less so many hours in the day
01:26:46.36 --> 01:26:50.04 But if you're going through something if you've gone through something like this reach out to your brothers
01:26:50.84 --> 01:26:56.04 Find a connection to another military guy because nobody can understand it like another military guy
01:26:56.04 --> 01:27:01.48 And that's part of the stress of it part of the stress of it is is that you don't feel like you can possibly explain
01:27:01.48 --> 01:27:03.000 What you're dealing with to anybody else?
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.72 There's no way they could possibly understand and comprehend it
01:27:05.72 --> 01:27:10.84 But another guy has been to combat can and we can sit in the room next to each other even if we sat there and said nothing
01:27:10.84 --> 01:27:15.48 We would get each other and so you got to reach out to each other do not isolate
01:27:17.64 --> 01:27:19.80 That's that's great advice and actually
01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.60 One thing that's very interesting to me is that I get emails from guys and
01:27:25.72 --> 01:27:27.72 That they're basically
01:27:28.04 --> 01:27:34.44 Doing that they're gonna do that right now with us. There's some of those guys out there that are that are going okay
01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.40 Yeah, and and the message is yeah, I mean
01:27:37.40 --> 01:27:43.16 The military guys had been through this kind of stuff before again. I was never cake
01:27:43.16 --> 01:27:47.24 I never even came home for my guys, you know, there was another kind of
01:27:49.40 --> 01:27:53.24 Another kind of misery I guess it does know you're just sending people home
01:27:55.24 --> 01:27:57.24 It's awful
01:27:58.36 --> 01:28:00.04 But yeah, don't isolate yourself
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000 Talk to your brothers
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:08.92 Find them and tell them what you're thinking about yeah, and and this is awesome, right because
01:28:09.48 --> 01:28:14.04 Twitter and Facebook and messages like this, you know, we can kind of reconnect, you know
01:28:14.28 --> 01:28:16.68 We can kind of talk about doing some cool stuff together
01:28:16.92 --> 01:28:21.64 Whether it's due jits you or running a badass race or doing something to challenge you physically or mentally
01:28:21.80 --> 01:28:27.48 We all can kind of give ourselves a electronic high five, you know, if there's something badass you're still doing today
01:28:27.48 --> 01:28:34.84 And you know what here's another thing to transition man, man, so so so so we so that happens
01:28:34.84 --> 01:28:36.84 I'm home and in
01:28:37.40 --> 01:28:42.84 February 2007 I get off active duty and thanks so for those of you that don't track in the calendar here
01:28:44.44 --> 01:28:46.44 Mikey died September 29th
01:28:46.84 --> 01:28:48.36 2006
01:28:48.36 --> 01:28:51.72 That whole thing unfolds we got home. I got home
01:28:51.72 --> 01:28:56.04 I was the last with the last group to leave and we left
01:28:56.60 --> 01:28:58.44 Remoddy October 21st
01:28:59.16 --> 01:29:02.92 Took us a couple days to get home, but now we're home. We get post appointment leave
01:29:03.32 --> 01:29:08.60 We reassemble well you do post appointment kind of debrief types up then we get post appointment leave
01:29:08.84 --> 01:29:15.80 So now you're talking it's December all of a sudden December, you know October is November. It's now it's the same thanksgiving now it's on this December boom
01:29:16.44 --> 01:29:17.64 And
01:29:17.64 --> 01:29:24.76 So not much time has gone by it's been packed and February you're getting out of the I'm gone and that warm machine keeps cranking by the way
01:29:24.76 --> 01:29:31.000 So the guys are back to right into another poll tuned they're doing pretty deployment work and whatever do whatever it just it keeps on cranking and
01:29:31.48 --> 01:29:36.52 And then proof I'm out of the Navy and I jump right into the mortgage business
01:29:37.16 --> 01:29:44.52 Because you know nothing like a natural transition from the seal teams and the battlefield of Ramadi to doing 30 year fixed mortgages
01:29:44.52 --> 01:29:49.08 And it's and it's 2007 though. Yeah, so you actually weren't doing
01:29:49.72 --> 01:29:51.72 Fixed mortgages for 30 years
01:29:51.96 --> 01:29:59.80 That the mortgage industry for those of you that don't know the mortgage industry in 2007 was a place where a lot of people were making a ton of money
01:30:00.36 --> 01:30:04.12 And it was about to all come to a screen. I was not making a ton of money
01:30:04.12 --> 01:30:08.84 I was just like that. I was brand new right so I leave this steady two week paycheck
01:30:09.48 --> 01:30:11.48 Brotherhood and a job I wanted to do
01:30:11.48 --> 01:30:17.48 My entire adult life at that point and had it just came for great deployment and get into the mortgage now
01:30:17.48 --> 01:30:19.24 I did that because I need to be home and by the way
01:30:20.52 --> 01:30:25.96 This much of the struggle was to get out and and I really my heart was truly torn in two opposite directions
01:30:26.52 --> 01:30:34.48 Man, I look back in the last nine ten years that I've had the opportunity to raise and shape my two young boys to be the young man
01:30:34.48 --> 01:30:36.16 That they're becoming have been absolutely
01:30:36.36 --> 01:30:38.36 priceless and
01:30:38.36 --> 01:30:43.64 But you know, so I find myself February sitting in the quiet office of a mortgage office at like
01:30:44.12 --> 01:30:46.44 630 in the morning because that's just how I roll
01:30:46.44 --> 01:30:50.84 I got a key. I'm gonna get in there. I'm gonna figure it out and then nobody you know first guys not showing up
01:30:50.84 --> 01:30:54.68 It's like nine, you know, I'm in the reading guideline books trying to just you know
01:30:54.68 --> 01:31:00.68 I've no I've no paycheck. I've no income and so man it got rough. I started to struggle
01:31:01.24 --> 01:31:03.24 I'm struggling
01:31:03.24 --> 01:31:06.04 financially for one thing. I'm struggling emotionally
01:31:06.04 --> 01:31:13.96 I'm struggling in building new relationships and you know kind of like a little bit of a chip on the shoulder and a sort of a little bit of an attitude
01:31:13.96 --> 01:31:18.76 From combat to trying to build relationships in the civilian world and that was tough
01:31:20.12 --> 01:31:25.40 But I mean there were mornings. I sat there quietly and by the way that picture that you talked about at the beginning of this deal
01:31:25.40 --> 01:31:28.40 I have that hanging on my wall. I look at it every single day and
01:31:30.92 --> 01:31:34.68 One of the things that continued to drive me and for military guys who were listening
01:31:34.68 --> 01:31:36.68 As corny as this may sound
01:31:37.64 --> 01:31:40.12 The legacy of my brothers is what drives me
01:31:40.76 --> 01:31:43.72 The opportunity to help my fellow veterans drive me
01:31:44.44 --> 01:31:50.60 Because you know doing mortgages. Yeah, not super exciting right, but I sat there quietly trying to figure it out
01:31:50.60 --> 01:31:56.28 I I all I got divorced. I lost a house to for closure. I showed so to another house
01:31:57.24 --> 01:32:03.44 There's a time when I looked over my young son Gunner is asleep it on the floor. I got no furniture in the house a house
01:32:03.44 --> 01:32:09.04 That's days from it's already been foreclosed and it's days away from the sheriff coming to say get out and
01:32:10.32 --> 01:32:19.40 That drives me and I think about Mikey and the sacrifice that Mikey and Mark made and it drives me because they made a sacrifice and
01:32:22.04 --> 01:32:25.14 In some ways this is this is bad talk right here and
01:32:25.14 --> 01:32:32.74 In some ways I beat myself up that I wasn't on the roof that day with Mikey because that was my opportunity and I came home early for my son
01:32:33.78 --> 01:32:36.82 And then I think well if I had it on that roof
01:32:37.14 --> 01:32:43.46 Maybe it could have been me and then there wouldn't be a father there to raise Gunner and to raise Tristan into the next generation of warriors
01:32:44.02 --> 01:32:46.42 And either way the sacrifice at Mikey made
01:32:47.78 --> 01:32:51.86 He made that so that I could live and I have an obligation to
01:32:51.86 --> 01:33:04.06 To use every ounce of my ability to use my mind and my body and my drive and my determination to fight in kick and scratch every single day to honor his legacy
01:33:04.30 --> 01:33:10.58 To build and to mentor young men to help my fellow veterans and to make this country a greater country and
01:33:11.30 --> 01:33:12.98 All those things
01:33:12.98 --> 01:33:16.94 The more I do the more I feel like I can honor Mikey in his legacy and
01:33:16.94 --> 01:33:23.66 To do anything else would be to slight the great sacrifice that he made and so
01:33:24.14 --> 01:33:29.58 Think of your brothers if you're in a military and you're out now and you're trying to get what think your brothers honor them
01:33:30.78 --> 01:33:32.78 And you and I were having dinner
01:33:34.06 --> 01:33:36.30 Actually we're having dinner at the
01:33:36.30 --> 01:33:40.54 Christening of the USS Michael Montsour awesome ship and
01:33:40.54 --> 01:33:47.98 And you were going into that situation you just kind of rattled it off just now like it wasn't no big thing right
01:33:48.86 --> 01:33:54.38 Your kid is sleeping on the floor because you have no bed no furniture you're that by the way that that
01:33:54.54 --> 01:33:59.74 Paycheck you've been accustomed to getting for whatever five years in the Navy is gone
01:33:59.74 --> 01:34:03.90 Right when you get out of the military after five years you don't get anything you get nothing
01:34:04.22 --> 01:34:09.02 So you have no paycheck coming in but there's no salary in the mortgage industry right
01:34:09.02 --> 01:34:15.10 So it's all 100% commission your son is sleeping on the floor because you have no furniture
01:34:15.66 --> 01:34:21.50 You've foreclosed on one house you short sold another house and you're about to get evicted
01:34:22.78 --> 01:34:24.78 That's your life at this point right
01:34:26.30 --> 01:34:30.22 Not to mention in the back of your mind or in the front of your mind
01:34:32.14 --> 01:34:34.14 You got this thought
01:34:34.70 --> 01:34:36.70 that
01:34:36.70 --> 01:34:38.70 Mikey died
01:34:38.70 --> 01:34:40.70 And you weren't there right
01:34:42.62 --> 01:34:45.98 How did you look at all that and
01:34:48.86 --> 01:34:50.86 Shug your shoulders
01:34:50.86 --> 01:34:54.94 Grit your teeth and say I'm gonna kick this things ass
01:34:57.74 --> 01:35:01.90 Where did you start at the very bottom?
01:35:01.90 --> 01:35:09.02 I'd like to think I bounced because I hit so hard
01:35:09.34 --> 01:35:11.34 Never give up
01:35:11.66 --> 01:35:20.06 The legacy of my teammates. I mean here's the deal. I think about guys that are committing suicide today or thinking about committing suicide and
01:35:21.98 --> 01:35:24.22 Think about this. Do you want to give that
01:35:25.18 --> 01:35:26.70 nasty
01:35:26.70 --> 01:35:29.74 Enemy even one more victory
01:35:29.74 --> 01:35:31.74 Fuck them
01:35:33.26 --> 01:35:37.66 I am going to win because I am not going to let them defeat me
01:35:39.66 --> 01:35:45.98 And I look at my boys. I pray it a lot for me. It's my faith and Jesus Christ saved me
01:35:47.02 --> 01:35:49.02 So I keep fighting
01:35:49.42 --> 01:35:51.42 And you know what that's just
01:35:52.78 --> 01:35:57.58 Never gonna quit never you are not done until you're six feet under
01:35:57.58 --> 01:35:59.58 The ain't done
01:35:59.58 --> 01:36:07.50 I would tell you if I ever found myself in combat where I was shot and dying and often my own an Afghanistan or something like that for example
01:36:07.90 --> 01:36:09.90 I would take the
01:36:09.90 --> 01:36:11.26 Glass grenade I had
01:36:11.26 --> 01:36:13.26 Pulled the pin and laid underneath myself
01:36:13.82 --> 01:36:15.82 So that when the enemy came to try and get my gear
01:36:16.22 --> 01:36:17.82 They blow themselves up
01:36:17.82 --> 01:36:21.02 Because I am not done until I am gone
01:36:21.02 --> 01:36:28.06 And even then if you've laid the right foundation the legacy you leave the messages and what you've done to help the next generation
01:36:28.94 --> 01:36:29.98 That's it
01:36:29.98 --> 01:36:35.58 I'm just never gonna quit never you can knock me down and I will get back up you cannot be down and I will get back up
01:36:36.14 --> 01:36:39.18 I will get back up. I will get back up. They obviously
01:36:40.22 --> 01:36:43.42 Well for those of you don't know because you don't know Andrew he did get back up
01:36:43.90 --> 01:36:50.78 He absolutely got back up. He now runs a very successful business and is out kicking ass on a day
01:36:50.78 --> 01:36:56.06 Rebase this and taking names and it's been you know a lot of this you know again
01:36:57.10 --> 01:36:59.74 Whenever I look at myself and I went on this big
01:37:00.70 --> 01:37:02.70 little or I went on this big kind of
01:37:04.30 --> 01:37:07.26 Tyrate about how you need to mentor your people and all that
01:37:08.22 --> 01:37:13.42 And take care of your brothers. Well guess what you know where I was when Andrew was going through this shit
01:37:14.86 --> 01:37:16.62 I was working
01:37:16.62 --> 01:37:19.26 I was working he didn't call me he didn't
01:37:19.26 --> 01:37:22.14 And I didn't make myself available
01:37:23.02 --> 01:37:25.02 You know so you
01:37:26.06 --> 01:37:32.14 Go go you know taking care of of your friends goes beyond just when they ask for help
01:37:32.14 --> 01:37:34.22 You need to seek them out and make sure that they're doing all right
01:37:34.78 --> 01:37:37.42 Because I let him go and that was that
01:37:37.98 --> 01:37:43.34 Get out of the Navy and it was bye bye and keep in mind. I wasn't gonna come and ask you because maybe I was a little embarrassed
01:37:43.34 --> 01:37:49.82 You know about how dire my situation was so if you're a leader just know just like kids who are going through buds
01:37:49.82 --> 01:37:51.42 They're gonna hide their injuries
01:37:51.42 --> 01:37:55.90 Right because you know I don't want to come to the guy who I respect and say hey, I am flat out right now, bro
01:37:56.22 --> 01:38:01.18 You know so I'm just gonna keep digging and I know we talked about it. You're like man. Why didn't you come to me?
01:38:02.38 --> 01:38:04.86 I don't you know what it wasn't a mine hatred to do so
01:38:05.98 --> 01:38:09.42 Maybe that wasn't the best decision. Maybe I should have reached out but
01:38:09.42 --> 01:38:11.42 Either way, I wasn't gonna quit
01:38:14.14 --> 01:38:16.14 Well, that's awesome and it's awesome to see
01:38:17.10 --> 01:38:19.10 What you've done
01:38:19.10 --> 01:38:25.74 See where you're at now like I said kicking ass and taking maids and and raising to a badass young man
01:38:26.14 --> 01:38:30.54 They're good boys man the next generation of warriors. That's one of the things I'll be compassionate about I'll tell you
01:38:30.54 --> 01:38:31.90 You know
01:38:31.90 --> 01:38:33.90 When you get out any transition
01:38:33.90 --> 01:38:39.18 It is it's hard because you leave this brotherhood you leave this common scent this common goal and you know
01:38:39.18 --> 01:38:42.38 You're fighting for freedom you're fighting for liberty and you're fighting for your brother and your sister
01:38:42.38 --> 01:38:44.22 You're right left and then you get into some
01:38:45.02 --> 01:38:47.02 Job where you're sitting in a desk
01:38:47.90 --> 01:38:49.90 Type it on a computer which is boring
01:38:50.94 --> 01:38:55.82 So you have to look here's a deal you have to find a purpose behind what you're doing and
01:38:56.78 --> 01:38:59.10 Mortgage is like seriously jumping out of planes
01:38:59.42 --> 01:39:01.18 Blown things up shooting guns diving
01:39:01.58 --> 01:39:05.10 Rebreathers all all high ends up to doing 30-year-fix mortgages. I mean
01:39:05.10 --> 01:39:10.86 Wall wall I mean how do you how do you get excited about that look you don't you don't get excited about doing that
01:39:10.86 --> 01:39:14.30 All right, I'm really honestly what you get excited about is something else behind it and for me
01:39:14.30 --> 01:39:15.82 It's helping my fellow veterans so
01:39:15.82 --> 01:39:21.10 You don't know nine people show my business. I do VA loans. Okay, so why because I want to help my fellow veterans
01:39:21.42 --> 01:39:26.46 Nobody will take care of that or better. And I will and that's that's my mantra right if if if if a guy goes down the street
01:39:26.46 --> 01:39:28.46 You will not be taking care of
01:39:28.70 --> 01:39:33.18 Better than if he comes to me because I am deeply passionate about helping my fellow veterans
01:39:33.18 --> 01:39:39.98 And that's how I get passionate about the job that I do now. I find a purpose behind what I'm doing and so you might be in some job now that you're out
01:39:40.22 --> 01:39:42.22 And you might be a god just
01:39:42.46 --> 01:39:43.90 Sox you know
01:39:43.90 --> 01:39:47.26 But find a reason behind it could be a small thing
01:39:47.58 --> 01:39:52.62 Right like there were jobs in the military that sucked. There were jobs there there's parts of every job that sucks
01:39:53.58 --> 01:39:58.54 You just got to deal with it. That's life and find a purpose behind what you're doing and then and then
01:39:58.54 --> 01:40:02.62 I'll just tell you this is a this is like one of these secrets of life that I have found
01:40:03.50 --> 01:40:07.98 Life is easier when you find a way to help somebody else when you find a way to help somebody else
01:40:08.62 --> 01:40:11.82 Miraculously your problems begin to go away
01:40:12.78 --> 01:40:17.82 So focus on somebody else's problems and how you can help them and all of a sudden you forget about yours
01:40:18.62 --> 01:40:22.86 And so find a way to help other veterans. I see guys. I see veterans today who are
01:40:22.86 --> 01:40:29.10 Who have been blown up and lost limbs and had been in similar difficult situations and they are make they're doing
01:40:29.50 --> 01:40:35.58 Fantastic because they've started organizations or leading organizations or deeply involved in organizations that are helping fellow veterans
01:40:35.98 --> 01:40:42.06 And there it is. It's like this mirror. It's like this miracle. You sit out to help somebody else and I'll have sudden your problems
01:40:42.06 --> 01:40:45.02 Just seem to melt away. So if you're struggling right now
01:40:46.86 --> 01:40:48.86 You can reach out to me
01:40:48.86 --> 01:40:51.50 Facebook Twitter whatever just share your story
01:40:51.50 --> 01:40:54.70 Connect and then find a way to help someone else
01:40:55.50 --> 01:41:01.58 And do it in a way that you're passionate about man. I mean I'm passionate about raising my two boys into the next generation of warriors
01:41:01.58 --> 01:41:05.66 I'm I'm passionate about I mean for it's look around at the
01:41:05.82 --> 01:41:08.78 Spindless cowards that society is raising today
01:41:09.50 --> 01:41:15.74 Who is raising the next generation of warriors to keep America the greatest country on the planet
01:41:15.74 --> 01:41:22.46 This generation that says that everybody gets a trophy that you get a freaking
01:41:23.50 --> 01:41:28.46 Graduation certificate when you graduate from first grade that's bullshit all right
01:41:29.26 --> 01:41:32.70 So you get a piece of coal going to kick in the ass, that's right
01:41:33.66 --> 01:41:38.30 You get something when you earn something and so raising my boys into
01:41:38.30 --> 01:41:48.38 It's hard young men to become gentlemen strong warriors men of character who wills who will have a spine and stand for something
01:41:48.94 --> 01:41:52.94 That's what we need to do and those you guys have been to combat certain arm military
01:41:53.18 --> 01:41:55.18 You know how to do that
01:41:55.18 --> 01:41:57.82 If you don't have kids find a way to involve in local high school
01:41:58.14 --> 01:42:05.18 Maybe a local middle school instead of be a role model and set an example for some young boys to be the next generation of badass American warrior
01:42:05.18 --> 01:42:10.78 Who will stand for and protect this country and protect liberty? That's something to get pretty excited about I get passionate about that
01:42:12.06 --> 01:42:16.38 Yeah, that's something that everybody needs to get passionate about and like you said especially the veterans that
01:42:17.90 --> 01:42:23.26 That no one understand that and they no one understand and appreciate what real freedom is that's right
01:42:25.42 --> 01:42:27.42 Well, I think that's
01:42:28.22 --> 01:42:30.22 All we've got for tonight
01:42:30.22 --> 01:42:31.42 Jimmy
01:42:31.42 --> 01:42:33.98 Closing comments. I think you just about summed up
01:42:37.10 --> 01:42:39.10 Well first and foremost
01:42:39.90 --> 01:42:40.94 Andrew
01:42:40.94 --> 01:42:42.94 Thanks for your service
01:42:42.94 --> 01:42:49.82 Thank you for answering the nations call and I appreciate what you did for me and what you did for the teams
01:42:51.18 --> 01:42:58.30 Thanks for coming on the podcast and sharing your lessons learn not only about combat, but about what comes after combat
01:42:58.30 --> 01:43:00.30 That
01:43:00.14 --> 01:43:03.18 Then for those of you out there listening to the podcast
01:43:04.62 --> 01:43:08.38 And you want to keep listening to podcast you want to support the podcast
01:43:09.74 --> 01:43:12.06 My brother echo Charles gonna tell you how to do that
01:43:13.34 --> 01:43:19.10 Before I tell you I actually have a question yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a way light-hearted question compared to let's go
01:43:19.98 --> 01:43:24.62 So when you go into the mortgage industry, yeah, and you know there's other people in the office as well
01:43:24.62 --> 01:43:33.18 Like what did they think about did they know you know you're you're you're past they find out you know, but it's hard to right because in the seal teams we have
01:43:34.30 --> 01:43:35.82 We have a quiet
01:43:35.82 --> 01:43:39.34 Professionalism and so one of the things that I've struggled with is you know
01:43:39.66 --> 01:43:44.06 Look, I'm I'm certainly proud of my service, but I don't want to use my service in my background in the seal team
01:43:44.06 --> 01:43:49.82 Does a way to advertise and there are many there are douchebags in the mortgage business who pray on
01:43:49.82 --> 01:43:54.78 Military dude and and they've got some great fancy marketing, but they're hard to not in the right place
01:43:55.02 --> 01:43:56.14 So
01:43:56.14 --> 01:44:00.14 Relationships little by little it it sneaks out and it's fine of other people know, but no
01:44:00.14 --> 01:44:02.94 I don't walk in there and tell people that it hey, I'm a Navy seal. I mean
01:44:02.94 --> 01:44:07.26 You know, Tony was just on a week and yeah, and I don't know why we've never talked about this before
01:44:07.26 --> 01:44:11.18 I've never talked about this before but like anyone that actually calls themselves a Navy seal
01:44:11.58 --> 01:44:14.62 It's like suspect right here. Hey, how's it going? I'm a Navy seal
01:44:14.62 --> 01:44:17.26 All right, what's the name of seal? They're just so like you can tell me you're going away
01:44:17.26 --> 01:44:24.14 Just like what's this guys deal right? All right, just no right no right exactly but like you like okay
01:44:24.14 --> 01:44:28.46 Jocca walks in we meet Jocco for example and
01:44:29.10 --> 01:44:32.14 He's you know whatever he's Jocco we're gonna be kind of like hey
01:44:33.98 --> 01:44:38.86 Are you in maybe seal kind of thing but you you're kind of like in every day guy
01:44:38.86 --> 01:44:42.94 I kind of do so you're like kind of like the guy in the movie who they show him work
01:44:42.94 --> 01:44:46.14 You know whatever and it flashes back to his passing he's kind of the superhero
01:44:46.14 --> 01:44:48.14 You know you're like one of those kind guys
01:44:50.14 --> 01:44:53.66 Do they like do you think that they looked at you like that like oh yeah
01:44:53.66 --> 01:44:58.62 You're just you know our guy co-worker kind of thing but and then maybe one guy heard a room right this guy is you know
01:44:58.62 --> 01:45:01.82 This this the heart and warrior and they're the other guys like no
01:45:01.82 --> 01:45:06.22 No way look at that you know me. Yeah, it's um and that's how I'd prefer it
01:45:06.22 --> 01:45:09.58 I mean I'd rather be oh they've not knowing yeah, I'd rather be in the shadow
01:45:09.58 --> 01:45:11.02 I mean cuz look here's a deal
01:45:11.02 --> 01:45:18.70 None of us do this for acolyte none of us do this for the look at me and the guys who advertise like Jocco say and they're suspect because they probably didn't really do it
01:45:18.70 --> 01:45:19.50 You know
01:45:19.50 --> 01:45:27.02 But I'd say probably one of the best compliments I probably ever got was I heard about a conversation that happened when I wasn't there and
01:45:27.50 --> 01:45:33.30 This guy was like yeah, did you know that guys a navy seal and the other person said no
01:45:33.30 --> 01:45:35.94 Well, wait guys. He's so nice. You know
01:45:35.94 --> 01:45:40.36 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what it means. Yeah, I'd rather be I'd rather be stealth like that
01:45:40.36 --> 01:45:42.94 So you know it makes even more interesting is again
01:45:42.94 --> 01:45:47.66 We'll use Jocco as an example if Jocco kind of walks in a room and guys, you know
01:45:47.66 --> 01:45:49.94 Let's say a trouble maker guy. Yeah, they're gonna look at him be like
01:45:49.94 --> 01:45:53.30 I don't know. I'll start and being with this guy big
01:45:53.30 --> 01:45:55.62 Minot have been a you know a team guy
01:45:55.90 --> 01:45:59.74 But then you you don't have that to look at you know but not only
01:46:01.42 --> 01:46:03.42 And you know you did to though
01:46:03.42 --> 01:46:06.96 To me that makes it even more it yeah, but that's all you need really
01:46:07.50 --> 01:46:12.80 So it makes it that much more interesting to me, you know and it's great right because you know what a lot of times
01:46:13.42 --> 01:46:19.14 But I would say more often than not when we if we were out as a puttune guys would actually
01:46:19.14 --> 01:46:23.72 Wanna start a fight with a guy that looks like Jocco because they're they're looking to like test themselves
01:46:23.72 --> 01:46:27.70 Yeah, whereas like guys I mean that would be a massive miscalculation
01:46:27.70 --> 01:46:33.20 You know like really end of life event extinction my event kind of decision
01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:37.16 To be not to counter I know exactly what you're saying but like
01:46:37.84 --> 01:46:43.000 The facts are people don't mess with me when I'm out in public. Yeah, they just don't but I know exactly what you're talking about
01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:46.26 It's always some big guy the tall guy. I get somebody coming up to him and
01:46:47.14 --> 01:46:50.82 And actually you know you and I talked about this too for those of you are on the podcast
01:46:50.82 --> 01:46:54.96 You can't you know that are listening and you doesn't look like stereotypical seal
01:46:54.96 --> 01:46:56.46 He's a hundred and fifty five pounds
01:46:56.46 --> 01:47:02.72 He's what it how tall are you five seven five seven Susan look he's not your stereotypical
01:47:03.12 --> 01:47:07.62 seal looking guy now again that the public with that the public with things I guys gonna say
01:47:07.62 --> 01:47:12.32 There's no stereotype and some of the most badass guys are there every size
01:47:12.90 --> 01:47:16.74 But this is something that Andrew said to me one time which was
01:47:17.74 --> 01:47:21.76 You know he's you know basically people see me and what do they think they think oh this guy
01:47:21.76 --> 01:47:26.68 You know, he's just gonna be a knuckle dragger and and he thinks everybody needs to be big giant
01:47:27.44 --> 01:47:31.76 You know head smashers right and the fact of the matter is
01:47:32.32 --> 01:47:34.32 What what I care about is?
01:47:34.80 --> 01:47:38.52 Can you do your job and can you do it well are you tough? Are you brave?
01:47:38.92 --> 01:47:42.76 Can you lead and that's why Andrew I?
01:47:44.12 --> 01:47:48.64 He was like actually surprised like when you finally told me you know you like man, you know
01:47:48.64 --> 01:47:52.68 I was kind of thought you might not like me, you know because
01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.32 You know smaller and and
01:47:56.92 --> 01:47:59.52 You know I don't look like a seal and I was like bro
01:47:59.60 --> 01:48:04.36 It's not about how what you look like it's about how you act and can you do this job?
01:48:04.56 --> 01:48:10.000 Are you brave or are you gonna step up can you lead great example leadership right like that's what you that's what you
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.16 That was one point you focused on what was the capability of the person your team not what they look like and and some guys can do that
01:48:15.16 --> 01:48:19.60 Right they can they can go well, you know this or that but you were like I don't know them in this guy
01:48:19.60 --> 01:48:22.000 He puts out and get job done he's leading
01:48:22.32 --> 01:48:27.24 So you know your kind of like you some Dalton you're but watch roadhouse
01:48:28.16 --> 01:48:31.76 Oh, I remember yeah when they were like hey, I thought you'd be bigger

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.44 He does he does actually you know look a lot like Patrick's ways
01:48:40.44 --> 01:48:47.08 Thank you I appreciate your hands. Yeah, I'd rather remain stealth, you know and and use that to my advantage
01:48:47.08 --> 01:48:51.16 You know and kind of remain thought as the underdog
