how's this going to be divided up every day who's going to get what you know I'm like are you looking for pictures at this point that are good pictures that you want to see or you looking for pictures that are going to be news are going to be front page newspaper which one of those two or is it both. And I tell you this is one thing that when I when we're off the coast of Liberia and you're looking at the coast and you can see the coast we were literally maybe a couple miles offshore looking at the coast and I can see that there's waves breaking some kind of thinking you know I'm a surfer I'm thinking you know those look like good waves and then you can see there's build nice big kind of hotel you can see this beautiful white beach you can see it looks like a just beautiful place I'm thinking of myself. And yeah, it was, and when it, when it finished, I didn't know how I felt because I thought, you know, when you get so used to doing something and you know, I don't want soldiers to die so that I can go down and finish a story. But the situation in the camps was incredible they were just so overcrowded and again you know back to that sort of scenario of people being cramped on top of each other and then you know that's how disease is spread and you know so on. That's a common one though, like, people, okay, because it's not like it's like, oh, shoot, you know, like, what repeat that, because that's a common one, like they'll put duh You know, by the Royal Family and they just sort of said, listen, what you've done, you've not just put wooden basso on the map, but you've shown how much dignity the British show when, you know, those that are fighting for their country are coming back and the way the whole thing. You know, you know, you're not talking about just one other individual that you know really good I asked the young doctor who was accompanying me through the slum I said you know what's the deal and he said oh she's probably after church or something you know she's in her sandy best effectively with her perfect little shoes and her skirt and her pink umbrella. About three quarters away there we got a call and it said you need to turn off to there's a a mask grave has been found at hill and you're on route while you're going to pass it on the way back into Baghdad so can you stop off and have a look and my first reaction was I was so shattered from the four days in the Jaff that I was sort of slightly resigned about having to you know. You know finding myself in the middle of a mosque as a Westerner just thinking you know how did I get in here it was just you know and we spent a month looking at the stuff that was coming out and it was invariably pictures of soldiers within sandstorms and stuff like that you know there was no action you know it was. So if you're not if you know if if it's a listen it's features today just go out and find something that you know every picture you choose not going to tell the story. I mean you obviously thought you're pretty badass when you're like you know what I'm not going for the regional paper I'm going straight to London I mean you felt like after Sri Lung you know you go to Iraq and you see the war and that's one thing and like you said you're dealing with the dead and you're seeing people that were killed. You can get in the way and the last thing you want is to compromise a unit but they set these units up and they said yep the media has to come in and you know show us what's happening but most of the time he said you have your head down and your hand in the air and you're just blindly shooting and hoping. And, uh, you know, you said a 9-11 moment, which I understand where you're coming from, from a psychological standpoint of, hey, I know what I was doing at this point on September 11, well, September 11th was 4,000, maybe 5,000 Americans killed. And you know, people that'll see like a real good picture and they'll be like, hey, that's a good, that's a cool picture. You know you look quite good is he going to start getting my shifts you know Me personally, I need to have physical, you know, no, I got my pens lined up, highlighters lined up, you know, I think it's worth the physical. So I thought nothing of it carried on shots and more pictures and I thought actually I've got I've got quite a lot of stuff here none of it I was really thinking this is really strong you know What's obvious you know it's like sometimes you're going to sit for sure it's like shooting fish in a barrel it's there pointy camera shoot And I know this was, I know I said a couple of things on the podcast that were pretty rough. I think that's good for you and you know they talk about that to the veterans in World War II when you when you came home from World War II first of all you've been at war for three or four years and when you came home you got on to a ship. You know so which but she was finding these delicate way around just like Mary Poppins with you know I remember having to get in back into the car because what had the he just witnessed was just so shocking and I was just numb going all the way back to the the office because you know I. I just hadn't anticipated anything like that happening and it just came out of the blue and I understood why I could understand the father's sentiments. and I said I can't and he said what do you mean I said well I've got a gig tonight I'm playing in London and there are 13 other people in the band and if I get on a plane they're not going to have a drama. You just got up you know if you're looking for it you'll find it you know. But if you're busy and you're out and you're traveling so a week after that I was taking anything and he even if I was being you know sent out and stuff that I thought why am I being sent to do this you know. You know, I don't know what's going on, but it didn't. And when I look through these optics the whole picture changed because now you see all these buildings that look like they literally look like big beautiful you know beach.
