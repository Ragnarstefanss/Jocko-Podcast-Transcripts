So you know, we, so let's go back to Rick so Rick is a war officer, so do you guys maybe a pedi officer chief pedi officer Roughly he's like a company he was a company quartermaster, so he's not sergeant major, but he's like the next NCO down I'm going to guess he had about 18 20 years he would he had been a recon guy most of it, you know, I trained under him mentor to under him you know, it's like When you when you imagine casualties you're imagining private Smith and Corporal Jones and you know whoever But our first guy killed is a guy who trained his whole life for war, and he's the first guy gone You know, like there's no there's no status there's no seniority in combat. Well, it's, I think the reason that is is because it's so hard for people that Don't know what that brotherhood is like They don't know what it's like to want to do that They don't understand that that's That's the soldier in the child, that's the way you've wanted to be your whole life That's the way I want to be my whole life so to, for these things to happen is It's like feeling bad for an MMA fighter because they got punched in the face There you go for it You signed up for it and those guys, you know, they're there to fight And the military, you're there to fight and a byproduct of fighting in this situation Can be injury, it can be death Though the three days, it's almost like you hit a switch And suddenly the pain starts to dissipate The hollow feeling in your chest And just to fill back in The that stop crawling on your skin Because that's ergoing through all that I was grinding the stumps of my legs into the coach To give it some kind of other sensation Other than I described it as like It was like a dog, you ever watch a dog chew on a bone When he's going to between his paws and he's just going to town Like with his teeth, that's what it felt like On the ends of my legs my legs was like I had like an animal just knowing on my legs. and you know i got a podcast i'm starting the jodimitic podcast and uh their may or may not be an episode up uh and the next couple days but if people want to look for me there as well i'd be honored to try and entertain them as closely as you do and uh and as and as all the other podcasts i love to and you know i just do this to try and be me you know i don't know who the new jodimitic is i call i'm calling myself jodie three point old right now uh and and and and and this life is a trip you know i call myself a student of the human condition and i'm always learning i'm always learning and i and i love to meet new people and um Okay, we've got three wounded in action and one killed in action I said relaying the message that there were three wounded soldiers and one who was killed in the G-wagon that had been hit Every soldier had a zap number which would be used as an identifier in case you were wounded or killed in the field Standard operating procedure was that if someone died in combat you never revealed their name during the battle At this point we didn't know which soldier had been killed in that attack on the G-wagon And no one seemed to know the zap number either Finally the major got on the radio I need to know now who the fuck just got killed The radio crackled and a voice came on It was worn off Sir Rick Nolan sir Rick Nolan was the soldier I had had a brief argument with the day before I've always felt bad that our last conversation was a little strained Rick was a good man and a great soldier sitting in the front seat of that G-wagon He had no chance of surviving a direct rocket hit I looked at Barry and Cash we were all stunned in the silence Yeah, you feel like I'm pussy Even though you know you shouldn't feel like a pussy You feel like a pussy It's the most frustrating At the time it was one of the most frustrating things Because you want to be that guy for your for your for your woman Of course, I'm still that awesome alpha male that you fell in love with You couldn't whatever doesn't you know doesn't blink anything Except that water bottle inside the road right there What's that pile of garbage doing right there? You know how awesome You know guys are going to be jealous I had my legs blown off I'm going to be like Rob I'm going to be like Astroboy Be flying around And shit I'll have like Robo Coplegs or something Maybe I don't know I don't know what the thing like it's not like it didn't wreck anything like my career was fine like it was just well, I mean I lost a fiance out of it And I know I'm going to catch some, I might catch some shit from some guys that were there We didn't take our objective To this day You know what, 2016, you know, it's just 10 years later Almost, it's a 10 or a little bit 10 years And to this day, I'm like, we didn't take our objective but I wouldn't even be here if I had stepped on that landline I wouldn't have had these I wouldn't have these kids if I hadn't stepped on that landline after my second fiance walked out of the house and my you know like all I said that's my joke I like all good soldiers I have three ex fiancees and it does an ex girlfriend's sacrifice to the queen because we still swear allegiance to the queen because it's real that's like you said the teams come first and I had said well I'm going to retire about 44 with 25 years in so why don't I just start kids And me and another one of the guys from the regiment went to see him This was the first time I'd seen one of our guys hit by a land mind In fact, it was the first time I'd seen a casualty at all TJ was pretty banged up a couple of teeth were broken and he may have had a broken draw He had laceration's all over There's always a particular odor in the hospitals around people of suffered traumatic injuries I remember smelling that odor like blood or maybe just what I thought blood smelled like TJ was on a stretcher with big wheels We'd use this kind of stretcher before in training To me it was a kind of prop This thing we used for simulations But this was not a simulation This was the real thing TJ was still in shock It had taken a few hours for him to be extracted from the scene of the explosion Shorty and beer and Fenger are gone he said Yeah man, we replied, we heard I need a smoke man, I need a smoke TJ said The doctors and nurses wouldn't allow it but that's what I'm saying how can you know there's no course for that There's no course there's no course there's no training You know and and our military medical system was Like like the We have lots of medics we have doctors for things like spring dangles You're really I mean you should duck but the point is he's probably not going to hit you, but they whoever they left behind Were guys that knew what the wood knew what they were out knew what they were doing and I give them credit for that like You know they're not soldiers as we consider it, but they're tough guys You know and you guys you sniper team you guys didn't even have your body armor. Oh, well, I'm like, I've all the things to be laid for Yeah, that's right, a guy like, you want a guy like Jocco to think you're a shit You know, you're plug and can't make a timing He probably learned a lesson, but but that's the Mind said I'm looking for from day one from a guy that I'm going to put through sniper school because we don't we don't have a lot of numbers in Canada You know like I was telling you at any given time there might be a hundred and fifty maybe a hundred and eighty Snipers active at any time in the forces and that might and that you know if you add in our tier one tier two guys or maybe there's 200 and I was like what happened to my house and what is going on and like You know, what I told my dad when I went to Kosovo You know, in the book I taught what my dad one of the three times I've seen him cry in my life Was when I deployed to Kosovo for the first time and hear me out right because I was just like I was like I'm the city counselor and a lot of guys look up to me and this and that and all you know like got these kids Okay politics is not business, but there are some business aspects and that I am now dealing with people that aren't You know, I'm used to working in small teams with people that are professionals at what we do you know so snipers and even though that was 10 years ago that's basically my last real working environment That's what you know is that's what I know so if even if I'm the boss and you're my sniper so I guess in his civilian life this was something he got got into And in my mind I was just like okay, so he's gonna like leave on his own and go somewhere where again like in Miami, vice It's always like the worst part of town. And so I'd always try to envision a good being wound, okay, but it was like the cool scar across the cheek Or like some shrapnel in the rib cage I could show off a barbecue, you know, and talk about when I'm like 80 Yeah, so I've got some Taliban and menl in there I still remember when our seat when our commanding officer said he got we gathered up in the parade hall and he said When our CR is going to Kosovo and I still remember I was, you know, you know, you know, I have it at ease. And you know, that's the norm They don't like, when you sign up to be a Navy seal, they don't hide the fact that you might get gunfights It's like the first thing you read, it's in big, bold black letters You're gonna, you could get killed It's not in the small print at the bottom of the contract, you know, claws, B of Section 4 yeah here's how it closes out people often ask me if I regret my time in afghanistan because it cost me my two feet and completely changed my life if you live your life with regrets then you never move forward those six months in afghanistan before the explosion were some of the best times of my life I can honestly say as I look back on my life in the military I wouldn't have changed a thing if I hadn't stepped on that landmine I would never have connected with a Lana I would never have had two beautiful daughters my mind and body were pushed to the limit after my accident and ironically I came out on the other side a better more complete person maybe life would be easier now if I hadn't lost a part of both legs but it certainly wouldn't have been any more complete when I when I am in public today advocating for veterans rights or simply going about my daily life people sometimes approach me to say thank you for your service those five words mean more to me than anything else and now I'd like to say something jodie from me and on behalf of every american Canadian Brit australian and arrested a free world thank you for your service and your inspiration to all of us to overcome obstacles and to make a difference in the world thank you thank you man It was just like a feel like a like a Field craft thing so we were learning how to just stalk just as soldiers and we were we were side by side, but he was literally on an elevation Maybe four inches higher than me I remember I was looking at him and I was like, I just that's not a good spot to be yes Freeze boom Walker came over God. And that's when I went looking for like I'm not even sure who's in charge at this point Because we had taken so much of our leadership It'd been hurt the company's sergeant major to the warrants You know, when that Zettelmeyer got hit, you know, it wounded a bunch of guys But then I circled to bring it up, you know why because there's somebody out there that's in the field right now that's going on some operation and they're thinking you know what I probably better off if I didn't bring my body armor and I'm going to tell you Bring your body armor, yeah, bring your body armor. and we we we managed to connect I was wounded in January we connected in September or Octoberish of the same of 2007 my girlfriend that I had had when I got wounded had left no fault of hers I don't blame her one one bit you know to get thrown into a situation where you have to care for a wounded soldier a guy who before was like a rock you know But I had to radio and remind them hey guys we're coming in from your flank You've looked through thermal I've looked through thermal The guys like us look anything like bad guys looking in through thermal I don't know how it happens but it's like not even like it's it's it's almost a class of its own is it No, it's like a little Dune buggy looking thing it had like a four cylinder engine build originally by Volkswagen You're guys are in the army and you're going to smoke crack and I'm like What I look at the guy I'm like what's he talking about he's like I go All right man Film some videos That's all you got left Be the Hister Be the document guy And just like in my opinion To go Winchester For a seal If he's anything like Like arm machine gunners That's pretty tough to do You're it's like I don't know I have my own reaction because they're my words But especially from someone like like you someone who shared Relatively common experiences so I I have I had to throw that out there that you know I have three beautiful blondes in my life with blue eyed blondes that you know keep me in check and because I the the feelings I had in the book they're not all in the past you know I woke up yesterday when I missed the flight man it it was more that I was disappointing you right like a parade of guys getting smashed and IED strikes and air you know whatever was happening You know I was standing there in the guy who ran Antonio at the San Antonio at the time was He was in green beret Fidio therapist but it wasn't what would have been best for me Me being a soldier so I'm like because I'm in a hospital where it's knee and hip replacements and amputations from diabetes So as a lot of older people I was probably one of the youngest people in the hospital at 30 I was definitely in the best shape You know like I remember my first physiotherapy session It you know there's so much we were talking about it right before we pressed record about Why is you your the last podcast was the art of war and and and to us it's kind of like a duck you know Joe Rogan says all the time. and what's really what's really To your point of you're not sure if that's what was meant what's really important is that the main thing you want to get across to your troops When you're going on to assault is you want the main point to be get aggressive That's the main point that you want to get across to them not hey the main point that you're going to take away from this is if we take casually stop You know We're going to get aggressive. and you know As the towers fell we watched it fall on TV like they interrupted a class We thought it was like a sesna right the guy comes so much as a little plane of the world trades in it We're in the middle of a you don't interrupt a class I don't always just a weird thing for me, but You know, they're the Romans and Irna the Greeks the Romans they called it, you know, the first time you see combat, you know, see in the elephant So It's not abnormal for these things to be happening What you have to do is accept that they happened and carry on with the job And in that moment, I remember, I said, sorry bro, because I was, I was, I was actually probably felt more like, hey man, sorry you're out of the game Because it's gonna get exciting from here You know, I, oh, a fallen soldier in combat to me is, especially a volunteer We weren't drafted, did anyone make you join the Navy? So then now you still weren't active in the military and you want to get your factory work on Yeah, well, I was I was as active as I had to be because it's you know, it's part time right, right, and then you know, there was a girl Just beautiful Russian girlfriend no I was a good reference you know miss my flight good I can bring my kids to school You know all this good they can't run So, I would like to go rainbows And again this is going back to what you were talking about Like when you don't really know what's combat's like okay I'm here, we're still doing the podcast It's beautiful weather I got to see my kids, I got to pick them up from school Because I didn't think I was gonna I got to, you know, I got to see some friends Walk the dogs that day And like you said, it's what we all signed up for And you know, going back to the situation here One of the things that you talked about the fact that you guys didn't secure your objective And one of the reasons that you didn't secure your objective the next day is because you had another friendly fire incident Right, so wearing ball caps and not having body armor makes you look cool, but also in our minds and we trained We have enough shit to dump you know why add body armor to it and and helmets, you know, we're going to be in a position.
