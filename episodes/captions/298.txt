[00:00:00] This is Jockel podcast number 298 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink, good evening echo.
[00:00:05] Good evening.
[00:00:07] Within weeks of their arrival, the seals of debt, golf, were shaking off their initial
[00:00:12] jitters and even displaying some measure of proficiency.
[00:00:16] Signs of this were apparent in every aspect of their operations.
[00:00:20] On ambush, no one clear to throw coughed, spit, sneezed, or even sniffled.
[00:00:26] From insert, an extract, the men stepped heel to toe to reduce the sucking explosion of mud
[00:00:32] walking and above all avoided the footprints of the man in front to keep from sinking
[00:00:37] even deeper.
[00:00:39] To improve their infield support, the seals befriended the pilots and crews of the Navy's
[00:00:44] helicopter squadron at Naabe and overhauled the seals denuded landing craft into an
[00:00:51] up-armored ironclad.
[00:00:54] Next heavy machine guns mounted to the gun will gonnels a 60mm mortar bolt to the rust
[00:00:59] to deck plate and a bunker-busting, recorulus rifle, pinned to the top of the sandbag pilot
[00:01:04] house.
[00:01:05] It was so much armament that the men quickly recommissioned the LCM, the mighty moe.
[00:01:12] To it they added a canmene to block the sun and rain, a two burner stove for meals, then
[00:01:17] draped hammocks between everything that didn't pivot or fire.
[00:01:20] It was essentially turned into a houseboat littered with empty hot sauce, bottles, coffee
[00:01:25] cups, clothes, lines, all aids to reduce the number of trips back to Naabe and increase
[00:01:30] the amount of time they could spend in a mission area.
[00:01:33] To improve the quality of their encounters with the enemy, they experimented with a variety
[00:01:37] of tactics, false insertions that made the vehicle ang thank the seals that landed
[00:01:41] where they had false extractions that made the vehicle ang thank the seals of the left
[00:01:45] and probably most important squad sized missions that have the seals punch.
[00:01:50] But correspondingly increase their stealth and the amount of swamp land they could cover
[00:01:54] thus doubling their chances of via-con contact.
[00:01:59] No small challenge in an area as empty of the enemy as the wrong sap.
[00:02:04] And what did these innovations yield?
[00:02:06] A handful of capture documents and North Vietnamese currency, some fresh water wells, some
[00:02:11] rice caches, one so monstrous that it merited an air strike.
[00:02:17] Then finally after more than a month of frustrations, debt golf landed a jackpot ambush
[00:02:21] of two sand pans that killed seven suspected via Congrillas.
[00:02:26] The seals reaction was the same as anyone who has just caught a hot streak.
[00:02:31] A little more than a week after the first coup, one squad pursued a tip from the crew of
[00:02:37] a hovering navy gunship that had spotted several camouflage sand pans not far from mighty
[00:02:41] mows anchorage despite having already blown their cover in that area from several days worth
[00:02:48] of patrolling the squad leader in full daylight.
[00:02:51] The squad landed in full daylight and fell in behind point man Billy Macon, a keen I-28
[00:02:58] year old Texan, the father of a daughter and a five week old boy he had never seen.
[00:03:07] Being alone into the middle of the sun drenched clearing and spotting a veat Cong bunker
[00:03:13] making managed a single burst for the Zem 16 before he was cut down by an eruption of
[00:03:18] machine gun fire that left him stranded.
[00:03:22] Hugging the ground to get under the rush of snapping bullets and splintering branches,
[00:03:26] the seals fell back on their training and clawed themselves into a rough firing line,
[00:03:31] but one that was not nearly stiff enough to break the wall of lead that blocked their
[00:03:35] way to the fallen comrade.
[00:03:39] To Tom Truxel engaged in the untested platoon commanders perennial two front war, the enemy
[00:03:46] and his own doubts, it seemed that the only recourse might be to pull back to the river
[00:03:51] and to the mighty mows guns.
[00:03:53] That is, until one of his men fired a 40 millimeter grenade into the bunker's mouth.
[00:03:59] The shock forced a momentary flinch in the enemy's ambush, just long enough for the heavy
[00:04:04] weight, mows scone to bowl a mad dash for making who is carried to safety just in time
[00:04:10] to whisper a final message to his wife while the corpsmen ransacked his tiger stripes
[00:04:14] to find his wounders.
[00:04:20] Considering that makeens death was considering that makeens death and combat was not
[00:04:24] simply the first for the seal teams, but that it was also nearly a 2% man power loss for
[00:04:31] seal team one, no one would have faulted to wires if he had forced a pause to assess the
[00:04:38] operation that had led to the tragedy.
[00:04:42] He didn't.
[00:04:44] The reason was no more complicated than the same one taught to anyone who has ever looked
[00:04:48] up to see the belly of the horse that just bucked them off.
[00:04:52] Wires ordered his men back to back into their saddles and back into the rung sat.
[00:04:59] His perseverance would have payoffs within a month the seals of death go for expanding
[00:05:04] their operational repertoire from planned patrol and ambush to unplanned quick reaction
[00:05:09] counter attacks along the rung sat's choke points.
[00:05:13] In theory it was an operational expansion that finally fulfilled the bucklue reports
[00:05:18] recommendation for riverbank raiders.
[00:05:22] In practice it was a resurrection of the navies grapple swinging boarding parties.
[00:05:29] In counters now included the inland pursuit and cornering of black pajama wearing attackers
[00:05:34] firefights that varied from a few sharp rifle exchanges to 15 minute skirmishes.
[00:05:40] One of these against an enemy packed haystack that did not stop firing until the seals
[00:05:45] launched 48 grenades into it.
[00:05:50] And for along the operational impact of death golfs aggressiveness was considered so substantial
[00:05:56] that Admiral Ward approved its increase from two platoons to three.
[00:06:01] All but a guarantee of a corresponding increase in impact.
[00:06:07] While this blossomed so too did the seals confidence, best evidenced by their swagger
[00:06:12] around knobbe.
[00:06:14] But also by a wooden sign above the entrance to their tent, scrawled.
[00:06:19] Yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil because
[00:06:24] I'm the meanest bastard in the valley.
[00:06:28] Though the helmets and flack jackets of the uncountable gIs would soon boast the same
[00:06:34] thing.
[00:06:35] By mid autumn 1966 the seals claimed to meanest in the valley was undisputed.
[00:06:43] And the wrong sat no other unit was as lethal.
[00:06:52] And that right there is an excerpt from a book and the book is called by the water beneath
[00:07:00] the walls, the rise of the navy seals.
[00:07:05] And it's written by a guy Benjamin Milligan.
[00:07:09] This book is a comprehensive history book about the origin of the seal teams.
[00:07:18] Now that passage hit me because I trained throughout my entire career at a place called
[00:07:26] Camp Billy Maken out in the Imperial Valley of Southern California.
[00:07:32] And I knew the story of Billy Maken.
[00:07:34] He was awarded the Silver Star and they have that citation out there at the Desert Training
[00:07:38] Compound.
[00:07:39] They also have pictures of his platoon and BTF Tony, Tony of Friday night.
[00:07:46] We used to inspect those pictures and we used to look at BM1 Mascone.
[00:07:51] And he was listed in that platoon picture.
[00:07:53] We used to talk about him.
[00:07:55] And he was this massive guy we stood out in the picture and we used to think what would
[00:07:59] BM1 Mascone do right now in this situation.
[00:08:05] But that really is about all the information we had about Billy Maken and his platoon
[00:08:09] and what they didn't Vietnam.
[00:08:12] Some word of mouth stories that we would hear from some of the older Vietnam guys,
[00:08:17] but that's about it.
[00:08:19] But this book spells it out so much more and the book details the entire history of the
[00:08:26] seal teams from the scouts and raiders to the naval combat demolition units to the underwater
[00:08:32] demolition teams up to what we now know and where I served my adult life in the seal
[00:08:40] teams.
[00:08:41] Now I normally don't cover history books on the podcast because I prefer to read first
[00:08:49] person accounts of people that were actually there.
[00:08:51] People that understand what it's like to live through and experience things, not just
[00:08:58] the research it, well this book is an exception because the author Ben Milligan was a seal,
[00:09:08] which adds a level of understanding and connection that comes across on every page of this
[00:09:12] book.
[00:09:13] It is also so thorough and extensive of history of the seals that it leaves no stone unturned
[00:09:21] and connects really to the soul of the modern day seal, connects us with our frogmen,
[00:09:30] forefathers and I think this book should be required reading for all seals or anyone
[00:09:38] even remotely interested in the seal.
[00:09:40] So they understand where we came from and the sacrifices that were made to get us where
[00:09:47] we are today and it just so happens that we have the honor of the author Ben Milligan
[00:09:52] here tonight to talk to us about his time in the teams and his amazing account of the
[00:09:58] history of the frogmen.
[00:10:01] Ben, thanks for joining us.
[00:10:03] Thanks, Jacob.
[00:10:07] Let's get a little start off by getting a little background on you and where you came from
[00:10:11] before we get into the background and where the seals came from.
[00:10:13] Let's figure out about where Ben Milligan came from.
[00:10:15] So where did you grow up in the inapolis northeastern side and what was the situation
[00:10:22] you were born to mom and dad do?
[00:10:25] My dad was in here in the northern throat surgeon, worked in a small town in Indiana
[00:10:32] called Anderson.
[00:10:33] It was a small GM town.
[00:10:37] I think he was the only.
[00:10:40] He was him and one other auntie in town so he was kind of like minor celebrity status.
[00:10:49] It wasn't a restaurant that we would go to in town or somebody that could come up and say
[00:10:53] hey, doc, thanks for such and such.
[00:10:56] Hey, doc, I got a sore nose for help man.
[00:10:59] Yeah.
[00:11:00] At one point I think every single member of my family except for my younger brother worked
[00:11:04] in my dad's office so we kind of grew up in the medical field.
[00:11:09] Welcome to Welcom to Doc Milligan.
[00:11:11] Can you have a seat over there?
[00:11:13] Would you like a candy?
[00:11:14] That kind of thing?
[00:11:15] Yeah, I kind of was probably the worst of my dad's employees but he was kind of
[00:11:19] enough to keep me on the worst example of Nepotism.
[00:11:24] What about your mom?
[00:11:25] Did she work with you?
[00:11:26] How's my housewife?
[00:11:27] Yeah, housewife.
[00:11:28] She looked after us.
[00:11:29] She looked after us.
[00:11:30] She was three boys and one girl.
[00:11:32] So fair amount.
[00:11:33] What number were you?
[00:11:34] I was a male.
[00:11:35] So I have an older brother younger brother and then baby sister.
[00:11:37] So you're number two out of four.
[00:11:40] What about what sports were you playing growing up?
[00:11:44] I played soccer badly.
[00:11:48] I think they kept me on the team because the school that I went to was so small.
[00:11:53] They really didn't know what he else.
[00:11:56] Yeah, I didn't get to the seal teams through any athletic ability.
[00:12:00] I was a really good trier.
[00:12:02] So after the end of every soccer season when they passed out of awards, they would always
[00:12:08] give me like the Mr. Hustle.
[00:12:10] Most improved with some other.
[00:12:13] Just sort of underhandleward.
[00:12:17] What was the anything else going on in high school?
[00:12:20] What kind of music did you like?
[00:12:21] Yeah, I did.
[00:12:22] I was a decent a track but as far as music.
[00:12:26] That's typical stuff.
[00:12:28] Nothing crazy.
[00:12:30] Nothing crazy.
[00:12:31] Nothing hip.
[00:12:32] You're looking at the the lamest guy that ever got through.
[00:12:37] Yeah.
[00:12:38] When you said you ran track or you ran cross country, you're both.
[00:12:41] I kind of did a little both.
[00:12:42] I did cross country.
[00:12:45] My freshman year.
[00:12:46] What's the longest race you run in cross country and high school?
[00:12:48] It's like three miles or something.
[00:12:50] Yeah, it's nothing overwhelming.
[00:12:52] I was good at it.
[00:12:53] I probably could have done that.
[00:12:56] But after my freshman year, you run a mile when you're in high school.
[00:13:00] I think the fastest I did was something like 450, 448, something like that.
[00:13:05] But the only reason I think that was as good as I was ever going to get.
[00:13:11] When I when I raced after every race, it was, I mean, I dry heaving everything else.
[00:13:19] I couldn't, I would get so nervous before the race that I couldn't eat.
[00:13:22] I wouldn't sleep the night before as miserable.
[00:13:24] What were you nervous about?
[00:13:26] I was just brutal.
[00:13:27] Pain because I didn't have the natural talent to do this.
[00:13:29] So I just got it out.
[00:13:31] So you were nervous about the suffering you were going to experience.
[00:13:34] Yeah.
[00:13:36] What's made you suffer even more?
[00:13:38] Jack O'Wishos, tougher.
[00:13:39] I was just...
[00:13:42] And so what, what did you have any inkling about going in the military when you were
[00:13:48] in high school?
[00:13:49] Yeah, I knew that that was, I was going to do that.
[00:13:53] I think I announced to my parents that I wanted to be a CO when I was 12.
[00:13:57] They didn't know what a CO was.
[00:13:58] How did you know what a CO was?
[00:14:00] I've heard my older brothers friends talking about it.
[00:14:03] And prior to that, my grandpa had been a Marine in World War II.
[00:14:06] So growing up until I was about 12, I'd wanted to be a Marine.
[00:14:10] Then I found out what Navy SEALs were.
[00:14:13] And then I also sort of found out right at the same time that after the battle of
[00:14:18] O'Wishos and my grandpa had volunteered.
[00:14:20] He was one of the few guys that could swim and they were so desperate for a frogman.
[00:14:24] After O'Wishos and I went for the invasion of Japan that they had ransacked
[00:14:27] the ranks just looking for anybody that could swim and he had volunteered for the UDT.
[00:14:31] So he was one of the handful of non-navy guys that actually joined.
[00:14:36] So he didn't do any operations as a frogman, but he was attached to a UDT.
[00:14:41] So you found that out, but found that out.
[00:14:44] And I was like, well, you know, impressionable age.
[00:14:48] And I'm going to do that.
[00:14:51] So what was your comfort level in the water?
[00:14:54] I was like, hi, comfort level. He was, my grandpa was,
[00:14:59] I think we were at the pool every weekend.
[00:15:03] So when it was a big part of our growing up and then so very comfortable.
[00:15:09] But never raced in the water.
[00:15:11] Never swam competitively.
[00:15:13] Like I said before, the school that I went to was so small.
[00:15:16] I think I had 54 kids at my graduating class.
[00:15:18] I mean, I played soccer because there was no football team.
[00:15:21] I ran track. We didn't have a wrestling team or anything like that.
[00:15:25] I had those. I probably would have done them, but I did what I could.
[00:15:29] When I got to Buds, I, you know, realized after a whole week that I was easily the slowest swimmer that had made it through.
[00:15:37] I just didn't know what the hell I was doing.
[00:15:40] So when did you go to college after the school?
[00:15:43] And where did you go to college?
[00:15:44] Purdue study history.
[00:15:47] Is that what you knew you wanted to do?
[00:15:49] Did you always have like an affinity for history?
[00:15:52] Always. Yeah.
[00:15:53] Starting, you know, my dad was always reading to us.
[00:15:57] My grandpa was always reading to us.
[00:15:59] We would, as a family, we would take trips and often we were hitting a battlefield along the way.
[00:16:04] When I hit junior high though, right at that, you know,
[00:16:07] consequential point in my life. My grandpa, every, every fall, every fall break.
[00:16:13] He started taking me to a different, you know, the, the long weekend.
[00:16:17] He would take me to a different civil war battlefield or some other, you know, a revolutionary war battlefield.
[00:16:22] So it just kind of got, uh, I just got addicted.
[00:16:27] So it was just, uh, I got caught isn't enthusiasm, I guess.
[00:16:30] So when you were going to college, were you actually learning and putting,
[00:16:36] see, when I went to college, I was just doing what I was told to do.
[00:16:39] I mean, I went, I was already in the Navy when I went to college,
[00:16:42] but I was just doing whatever I needed to do to get good grades.
[00:16:46] I wasn't like, oh, this is so interesting.
[00:16:48] I don't think I said that one single time.
[00:16:50] I would just like, do I need to memorize this?
[00:16:52] Cool, give it to me. That was my attitude.
[00:16:54] But it seems like you might have had a different attitude.
[00:16:56] No, no, I, if you, uh, at least were trying to get good grades,
[00:17:00] you're better than me because I didn't care about that.
[00:17:02] So I mean, I, you're just trying to pass.
[00:17:05] Well, my, so I tried to enlist, uh, in, in the Navy, my senior year of, uh,
[00:17:15] high school, I hadn't shown up after a soccer practice back home.
[00:17:19] And I had gone directly from, uh, practice to the recruiters office.
[00:17:23] And I was getting ready to sign on the dotted line because I didn't want to go to college.
[00:17:26] I wanted to go right into the Navy.
[00:17:28] And, uh, uh, the recruiter to his credit, he, um, uh,
[00:17:33] stops me before I sign.
[00:17:35] And he, you know, points, you know, obviously behind me and he goes,
[00:17:39] do you know that woman, I turn around.
[00:17:42] My mom has both hands on the window and she saw it.
[00:17:44] I took a pause.
[00:17:46] Went out in the parking lot.
[00:17:48] My mom and I had a conversation, uh, and she begged me not to join the military.
[00:17:53] Nobody joined the military and our family since, you know, World War II.
[00:17:56] So when I got out there, I said I would go to one year of college.
[00:18:00] Uh, and after, if I did that one year of college, I would have their blessing.
[00:18:03] So when I'd signed up for classes my first year, I had no, I, I, I had no plan.
[00:18:07] I just signed up for every class.
[00:18:09] I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just,
[00:18:13] signed up for every class.
[00:18:14] It looked interesting.
[00:18:15] I signed up for the history of World War II.
[00:18:16] I signed up for, uh, I, I mean, I, I, I just, I had no, I just signed up for all these
[00:18:23] history classes.
[00:18:24] And I went to the first one.
[00:18:25] I was hooked.
[00:18:26] And so you did kind of like your classes.
[00:18:28] I liked my history classes.
[00:18:29] So there's only, uh, classes that I paid in the attention to, but I loved them.
[00:18:32] And I, I had, I had great, uh, professors, the history and political science classes.
[00:18:36] So there, there's really no military history classes or courses or, uh,
[00:18:41] left in the country.
[00:18:42] There's only a couple of institutions that do military history.
[00:18:45] Um, so they've, they've taken a lot of that military, uh, history curriculum and it kind of,
[00:18:51] uh, farmed it out to different disciplines, political science being one of them.
[00:18:55] Um, and so I would, you know, just look for all these interesting classes, all the stuff that,
[00:18:59] you know, I was interested in.
[00:19:01] Um, I managed to carve out a degree and when I graduated and, you know, two
[00:19:06] thousand, I, I don't, somehow I managed to graduate in four years.
[00:19:10] Um, then I, I tried to go to OCS.
[00:19:14] I had no idea what I was doing.
[00:19:16] I never met another seal.
[00:19:17] My application to go to OCS and then get, uh, a bud's contract afterwards was ridiculous.
[00:19:23] I mean, they asked, you know, on the application, now I know, you know, you need, like, an admiral or somebody to write a letter, recommendation.
[00:19:30] My buddy Fred.
[00:19:31] I had my high school soccer coach.
[00:19:34] My application was put back.
[00:19:37] Especially, that was in 2000.
[00:19:40] Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[00:19:41] In 2000, the competition for the officer bill it's is insane.
[00:19:45] Insane.
[00:19:46] Insane.
[00:19:47] So I just didn't listen.
[00:19:48] And the freaking soccer coach just did cut it.
[00:19:51] Such a bummer.
[00:19:53] It was a very nice letter.
[00:19:56] So, so then you just said, cool, I'm the most thing.
[00:20:00] Yeah.
[00:20:01] And my parents did you know, did you mom break down the game?
[00:20:04] You know, my parents were on a trip when this happened.
[00:20:07] Do you want to see God?
[00:20:09] Yeah.
[00:20:09] My parents were gone.
[00:20:11] Um, they knew how important this was to me.
[00:20:14] They knew that I really didn't have a plan afterwards.
[00:20:16] It's not like I'd, you know, been in some sort of apprenticeship to, you know, go to law school or anything like that.
[00:20:21] I wasn't prepared for anything.
[00:20:23] So, uh, when that, when I hit that roadblock, I called my parents.
[00:20:28] They were, you know, like I said, they weren't there talking my dad.
[00:20:32] And my dad, to his credit, just said this is something you have to do.
[00:20:37] And so I went over and went to the, uh,
[00:20:41] and listed recruiter and I signed that day two weeks.
[00:20:44] Two weeks later, I was gone.
[00:20:45] That's freaking legit.
[00:20:46] And what year was that?
[00:20:48] 2000.
[00:20:49] So I signed up and, uh, uh, early August of 2000, I was gone by the end of the month.
[00:20:57] That was 2000.
[00:20:59] Right.
[00:21:00] Okay.
[00:21:01] So you show up in boot camp.
[00:21:03] And you have that shocked your system.
[00:21:06] Did you say to yourself, what did I do?
[00:21:07] My mom was right.
[00:21:08] Oh, yeah.
[00:21:09] I was college graduate.
[00:21:12] I went down my building.
[00:21:14] Yeah.
[00:21:15] But, uh, folding underwear.
[00:21:18] Yeah.
[00:21:19] I mean, I didn't have the worst boot camp experience.
[00:21:22] Um, early on, they had, you know, asked for, if anybody here had, uh,
[00:21:28] college experience and I had raised my hand.
[00:21:31] So I got made the division, y'all.
[00:21:33] And so I was able to kind of leave from time to time carrying the mail bag.
[00:21:37] And just carrying the mail bag for 45 minutes.
[00:21:40] I was just marching around the base.
[00:21:42] Yeah.
[00:21:44] So you get to, what was your, like, pre-training getting ready for butts?
[00:21:49] Did you do anything?
[00:21:51] Yeah.
[00:21:52] I just, hey, whatever.
[00:21:53] Yeah.
[00:21:54] I've been following the, um, uh, the butts, uh, pre, or the pre-buds training, uh, plan.
[00:22:01] Uh, like, you know, certain number of pull ups set up, uh, push ups everything and then running and swimming every day.
[00:22:07] So you felt like you're pretty good shape.
[00:22:09] No.
[00:22:10] I didn't.
[00:22:11] I thought I was an okay shape, uh, and I've been doing it for a year.
[00:22:15] Um, um, so about four months before I actually, uh, joined the Navy, I had, uh, linked up with the, uh,
[00:22:25] the Purdue ROTC guys that were all training to go to butts.
[00:22:29] And when I linked up with them, their training was on a completely other level.
[00:22:33] These guys were serious.
[00:22:35] They had, you know, they'd met Sealed before.
[00:22:37] I'd never met them at one.
[00:22:39] And so I did four months of, uh, training with them.
[00:22:42] I mean, I, I mean, these guys were all in ROTC.
[00:22:44] I was like, uh, a pony tail that appeared.
[00:22:46] I just, I was just a, looked like a piece of shit.
[00:22:48] So I'm not sure.
[00:22:50] I'm like, who the hell is this guy?
[00:22:52] You had a pony tail at a beard?
[00:22:54] What year was this?
[00:22:55] I was just, I'm not sure.
[00:22:56] Yeah.
[00:22:57] Yeah.
[00:22:58] In 1999.
[00:22:59] Uh, but what was funny is, uh, a year later when I graduated butts, uh, two of these guys were
[00:23:05] show, we were checking into butts the day I graduated.
[00:23:08] And I burst into their room, uh, to say hi.
[00:23:11] And they had no idea who it was.
[00:23:13] They made it.
[00:23:14] They told me.
[00:23:15] Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:23:16] Do was, uh, any challenges in butts?
[00:23:18] Anything that gave you a struggle?
[00:23:20] Uh, swimming.
[00:23:21] Uh, yeah, I had to, uh, um, I, I expected that, uh, swimming would, would be just like
[00:23:30] it was, uh, like, running was for me.
[00:23:32] Like, you'd start, uh, like running for, for me if I was going to do a long run.
[00:23:36] Go out at a moderate pace, that moderate pace.
[00:23:38] The further you go, we'd get harder to maintain.
[00:23:41] And then by the end of the race, uh, you know, you're, you're, uh, physically taxed, but you
[00:23:47] can, you know, gut through the, the last bit of pain.
[00:23:50] I swam like that.
[00:23:51] I swam at a moderate pace.
[00:23:53] And by the end of it, I was, I was pretty well-gast.
[00:23:56] Um, and it wasn't enough.
[00:23:57] So I started going every weekend of butts.
[00:24:00] I was, uh, linking up with, uh, a master chief nepper, uh, who I didn't know at the
[00:24:05] time.
[00:24:06] I mean, I just knew that he was, you know, a guy that would, you know, take pity on all the
[00:24:10] people, uh, and, uh, so when everybody else was relaxing and kind of, uh, you know,
[00:24:14] licking their wounds from the previous week, I was at the pool of Master Chief
[00:24:17] Nepper.
[00:24:18] I would not be here.
[00:24:19] Uh, or I would never have made it through if it wasn't for his classes.
[00:24:22] And I mean, little that I know that, you know, he was, uh, I mean, he's, you know,
[00:24:26] one of the oracles of, uh, seal history today.
[00:24:29] So, so you, grab, when did you graduate from butts?
[00:24:33] Um, he was August of, uh, 2000.
[00:24:39] Yeah.
[00:24:40] August 10th.
[00:24:41] My, my 20th year was, uh, 2001, 2001.
[00:24:44] Yeah.
[00:24:45] So you graduated August 2001, and then where did you get stationed?
[00:24:51] Uh, I was supposed to go to seal 10, but I went to seal 10 for East Coast.
[00:24:55] Just some paperwork, mix up or something?
[00:24:58] Yeah.
[00:24:59] The half of our class was going to seal 10, five and the other half was going to seal 10,
[00:25:03] for whatever reason, seal 10 hadn't quite stood up yet.
[00:25:05] So they switched us to, team four.
[00:25:07] So you, so where are you in September?
[00:25:10] So you graduate in August of 2001.
[00:25:12] Where are you?
[00:25:13] Where, where, where you actually standing when you, when September 11th goes down?
[00:25:18] I was home having just completed, uh, airborne.
[00:25:24] So I, I mean, like everybody else in my class.
[00:25:27] I'm, I, I immediately went, uh, went downstairs, pack my bag.
[00:25:31] I was ready to go on no call came.
[00:25:33] Thought you were going to nom.
[00:25:34] Like I did.
[00:25:35] And I thought I was going to nom in 1990.
[00:25:38] We were not got in, man.
[00:25:40] We were going nowhere, but disappointment.
[00:25:43] So you're at seal 10 for you.
[00:25:46] You, you get into a platoon.
[00:25:48] What job you, what job are you in the platoon?
[00:25:50] Uh, I was the, uh, 60 gunner.
[00:25:53] This is paid gunner.
[00:25:54] Big gunner.
[00:25:55] Yeah, freaking new guy.
[00:25:56] Yep, new guy.
[00:25:57] No, uh, no responsibility.
[00:26:00] Uh, I was the, uh, I was the, uh,
[00:26:03] I was the intel wrap of the platoon.
[00:26:05] Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:26:06] They're like, oh, you went to college.
[00:26:07] Yeah.
[00:26:08] You can read intel wrap.
[00:26:10] Pro-street.
[00:26:11] What kind of platoon?
[00:26:13] So it's your team for you getting over tune.
[00:26:15] How is it?
[00:26:16] How's it work up?
[00:26:17] You have a good time?
[00:26:18] It was all right.
[00:26:19] I like, you know, there were some leadership challenges,
[00:26:21] but it was a good platoon.
[00:26:22] I mean, we had a good chief.
[00:26:23] A good OIC.
[00:26:24] Um, we, uh, we didn't have a great mission.
[00:26:28] We were, uh, we were a mark.
[00:26:30] So we've got attached to a, uh, you know, uh,
[00:26:32] uh, uh, uh, Marine, um, what was it,
[00:26:35] an LPD or LHA, something like that?
[00:26:38] And we were just sort of on call in the med.
[00:26:40] Um, you know, and at that point, you know,
[00:26:43] both, uh, uh, afghanistan and Iraq were going on.
[00:26:47] It was just, you know, we were sitting out in the,
[00:26:50] in the med just floating around.
[00:26:51] We didn't do anything until we,
[00:26:53] we got called, uh, go do Liberia.
[00:26:55] That was the, uh, the Liberian civil war.
[00:26:58] So we did some hydrographic reconnaissance,
[00:27:00] as stuff like that. You got your lead line and slayed out.
[00:27:03] I did ride a line.
[00:27:05] I did.
[00:27:06] And I was, uh, so we had done, uh,
[00:27:10] probably half a dozen of these things.
[00:27:12] Um, and then the, the last one that we were doing was, uh,
[00:27:15] directly in front of the, uh, uh, the US embassy in Manrovia.
[00:27:20] Um, and, um,
[00:27:22] um, I was probably the closest swimmer to the beach,
[00:27:26] which meant I was the closest swimmer to the sea and un-camera.
[00:27:29] Uh-huh.
[00:27:30] I got that out there and if anybody knew my, my history with swimming,
[00:27:33] I probably would've pushed me further back.
[00:27:36] Uh, but so I'm, you know, paralleling the beaches were doing this
[00:27:39] and I know that, you know, the whole world is watching and at some point I got wrapped up in my
[00:27:43] led line.
[00:27:44] I was like, oh my gosh.
[00:27:47] And I'm tied up in this thing.
[00:27:48] I can't swim.
[00:27:49] It's a really close shore breaks.
[00:27:51] So I'm getting hammered with waves.
[00:27:53] I bounce my head off of big rock.
[00:27:56] Like, I've got to get out of this line so I pull out my knife.
[00:27:58] my knife and I start cutting this thing. The way this coming up on me and I'm getting
[00:28:02] ready to get slammed with this thing and I don't want to stab myself while I'm doing this.
[00:28:06] And so I look around, I got no, I'm holding the slate with one hand, I got the knife
[00:28:12] and the other, and I need something to swim with. So I did the only thing I could do.
[00:28:17] I put my knife in my mouth and I started and I swam through the stroke. Like how
[00:28:22] world were to frog men is better.
[00:28:24] Oh, that's for you, you know, awesome. So you get done with that deployment. That was kind of the
[00:28:32] highlight of the deployment was doing hydrographic reconnaissance in the library.
[00:28:36] Well, I want to brag. But yeah, it's freaking legit.
[00:28:39] Yeah.
[00:28:40] Uh, hey, I did two arc platoon out on the west coast and I've done so many hydrographic reconnaidences.
[00:28:50] It's ridiculous. But I guess I've never done like a, um, I did real ones but they weren't in combat.
[00:28:57] They were like in Kuwait. They was real. Like someone was like land there. I mean, but didn't get,
[00:29:03] I never put my mouth in my, I make my knife and my teeth and swam out. But I think you could
[00:29:07] probably agree it's not the reason you joined the field teams, not Kuwait. Why join the
[00:29:11] sealed teams? And that must be, so what'd you do after that? Uh, I had some, you know, sort of family
[00:29:18] challenges. So I briefly got out until figured out where I was going to be living. When I finally
[00:29:24] found out I was going to be living in San Diego. Uh, I put my OCS package back together. I really wanted
[00:29:31] to go back to the teams and be an officer. Soccer coach, write to another letter.
[00:29:35] Reclamation. I actually had a few decent letters and I was, uh, I just got in San Diego. I,
[00:29:43] I, I, I, I contracted, uh, in my, you know, during that year off, Blackwater triple canopy.
[00:29:49] Uh, but where did you go Iraq? Iraq, you know, and what were you doing just PSD basically?
[00:29:53] Yes, yeah. But once we got in the San Diego, um, I, uh, where were you in, uh, where were
[00:30:02] Iraq, where you in what years? Uh, well, that was, uh, 2004, 2004, 2005. I mean, I, I, I, I guess it was 2005.
[00:30:10] I was back in the teams by 2006. What's PSD? Personal security detail. Yeah, it's like doing
[00:30:17] security. Yeah, so that's what a lot of the contractors were doing. You're doing security for
[00:30:23] other government workers. And those government workers could be people working on telephone lines.
[00:30:27] They could be CIA people. They could be government people. But it's basically security. Gotcha.
[00:30:34] So that's where many of those contracting jobs were for guys that were in special operations.
[00:30:40] Just doing security. That's, um, so how long were you out for that year?
[00:30:49] Then you come back in. You wait. What happened with your OCS package? So my OCS package was, uh,
[00:30:54] I really just needed my last letter of recommendation. So I was in the, uh, uh, the group one
[00:31:01] commander's office for my, for my interview. He was kind enough to give me an interview.
[00:31:07] I had been getting ready for that interview for a while. And, uh, the morning of the interview,
[00:31:12] I was, uh, contacted by a seal team 18 and said I was recalled. So I was like, well, it's not the
[00:31:20] end of the world. But let's see if I can get this, you know, OCS package signed off on.
[00:31:24] So if you serve everyone knows, seal team 18 is a reserve seal team.
[00:31:28] Correct. Or if you're in the, if you get out of this team, then you want to stay connected. You can go
[00:31:32] in the reserves. Yeah. That's what that is. So you got recalled. How many teams are there? Oh, like,
[00:31:36] all together. Or eight seal teams, uh, there are eight seal teams at the time for our
[00:31:42] on each coast and then there's that group. But then, uh, in addition to the, uh, uh, eight active
[00:31:47] duty team plus that group, there's there were two reserve seal teams with sort of a new concept.
[00:31:52] They, they were trying. So they got eight teams plus two reserve teams. So 10 and then dev group 11.
[00:32:00] Yeah. I guess. That's not in the way. Yeah. Kind of. There's some other things. But yeah. Yeah.
[00:32:05] So because when you say team, that's like a technical thing like, yeah, because you got S.D.V.
[00:32:09] teams to write. Right. Right. Right. Our also teams got, but the numbers, though, because that's
[00:32:16] well, you got S.D.V. team one and S.D.V. team two. So you got another two teams. All right.
[00:32:22] This goes deep. So you can't leave S.D.V.s. Yeah. I understand that boys are working hard. It's
[00:32:26] a different hard. Um, so I'm in the off and I'm, uh, I, you know, I, I knew that, you know, I, I've
[00:32:32] found out that morning. I was getting recalled, but still hoping that, you know, the, uh, uh, the
[00:32:37] captain could, uh, maybe figure something out. So I do the interview. Interview goes great. I think,
[00:32:43] and, uh, he's like, do you have anything for me? And I said, well, sir, um, not for nothing, but
[00:32:47] I just got recalled this morning. Uh, I was wondering if there's anything you could do, you know,
[00:32:51] I'd really like to, you know, follow through on the socials packaging, come back to the teams as an
[00:32:55] officer. And he just said, now that sucks. So I found myself back in the teams, but, you know,
[00:33:02] it was the best thing that could have ever happened. I went to seal team five and, uh, jumped on a
[00:33:06] great, putton, a great leadership and, you know, uh, that we, we followed you. Yeah, you guys
[00:33:12] really dust, not my task unit, but you guys went to hobby. Yeah. Yep. So you rolled out to hobby
[00:33:18] and you were a reservist that was activated. Yep. And they put you in a putton. Yep.
[00:33:23] Well, that's freaking awesome. It was, yeah, it was great. Did you do any of the work up or anything?
[00:33:28] Yeah. So you did the work up, went on to point it, but your reservist, but your
[00:33:32] in a putton. Yeah. What was your job? Uh, R2, or the radio telephone up, I was the
[00:33:38] com guy. I did a little bit of breaching, but then, you know, kind of taught myself how to be a J-tech,
[00:33:42] but that's a interesting thing to try and teach yourself while you're on the ground in hobby.
[00:33:46] And not only that, but, you know, I knew that the putton needed a com guy.
[00:33:51] I'd been to com school and never been a com guy, but they asked for a com guy and I said,
[00:33:55] yes, I'm the best com. That is time. I thought I'd do it. So it's good to call.
[00:34:01] Yeah. How was that deployment? It was great. What were you guys doing hobby in O-6, O-7?
[00:34:09] That was like the winner of O-6 into O-7, right? Correct. What kind of was your missions?
[00:34:13] What were you guys doing? We were doing a lot of, you know, sniper overwatches and then,
[00:34:18] just doing a go-in house after house. You know, doing little, uh, well, house to house raids,
[00:34:24] looking for al Qaeda, just like you guys weren't there. So you're kind of living the dream.
[00:34:28] I was living, I was doing exactly what I thought I would be doing and when I enlisted in 2000.
[00:34:35] Yeah. Yeah. That's good. I always felt that way when I was in Iraq. I felt like I was
[00:34:41] so lucky to be where I was. And then I will say in Ramadi it was a little next level because,
[00:34:48] you know, when you're a kid, you kind of look, I was thinking, no, you know, my whole life, I was thinking,
[00:34:54] no, right? But even, there was something even a little bit more seem like a little bit extra,
[00:35:00] was straight up World War Two, right? You're thinking World War Two, you think it takes,
[00:35:04] it's stuff. So in Ramadi, there was times where tanks were rolling down the street,
[00:35:09] rolling in through buildings, over walls, it was WWE.
[00:35:16] And man, it was freaking awesome. Yeah. But you're right. I mean, I mean, I had that
[00:35:23] non-expectation too and we got there. It was a, it was a ground war. The only thing that made it sort of
[00:35:30] non-like is the Fratee River. Oh, yeah, for sure. And we would use the Sockars,
[00:35:35] Tensert and, you know, there's only so many boat guys on the Sockars and sometimes they're alternating
[00:35:40] between right or port and starboard side guns. So if they didn't have anybody on, you know,
[00:35:45] a gun, you just stand up and you grab one. And yeah, you're in a t-shirt and rolling up your Fratee's
[00:35:52] River. And there was an area, an whole AO called OneMC or MC1. I can't remember, but it was up north,
[00:36:03] kind of north east of the town of Ramadi and it was on the north side of the river. And it
[00:36:08] looked like nom. It was ridiculous. It plus we had the Marine Corps, he was flying around.
[00:36:15] And we called it V at ROM because it was like, there's Ramadi, but it looked like V at ROM. And it was
[00:36:20] freaking crazy right on. And so you get done with that deployment and then what what are you doing
[00:36:27] you get home? At that point, I started thinking about grad school. Okay, I was,
[00:36:36] so you were a reserve. So when you got home, were you released from active duty kind of?
[00:36:40] Yeah, I went to, but I managed to parlay that and to going over to workhouse. I worked for a
[00:36:46] couple of years over at work home. And I, my platoon chief from Seal Team 5 was going over there to
[00:36:53] run the J-TAC program. And you know, I kind of taught myself how to do all that. So he said if you want,
[00:37:00] you can come over work with me what you're going to grad school. And so we just, we just did J-TAC
[00:37:05] stuff for the next two years while I went through. I got my degree. Where did you go to school?
[00:37:10] USD. Oh, I went to undergrad there. Did you? I'd use USD.
[00:37:17] Gorgeous. That's a nice place. And then when you're thinking, hey, we still think about trying to
[00:37:22] put that OCS package in or I was, I mean, I had, it was on the sort of the back burner. I was trying
[00:37:27] to decide whether or not it was going to go put the OCS package to go back active or do like an
[00:37:33] FTS package and get a commission in the reserves. So I had my first kid and once I had the first
[00:37:41] kid, I was like, I don't want to leave this guy. So I went with the reserves. So I got a commission.
[00:37:47] So the day I left active duty. I got a commission in the reserves.
[00:37:53] Oh, so you did end up getting a commission reserves? I did. You still have it right now?
[00:37:57] Well, I'm out of the reserves now. Oh, okay. I left left the reserves four years ago.
[00:38:02] Or maybe a little more. So you get done. And now you realize you want to stay home with the kid.
[00:38:09] And so then what you're trying to put your life together on the outside, how's that, though?
[00:38:15] No, great. Like any guy who leaves the, you know, their dream job and suddenly finds themselves
[00:38:23] doing something they never expected to do. It didn't go great, Jaco. I was, you know, like everybody
[00:38:29] trying to figure out what my next, my next big thing was looking for relevance in any, any area that
[00:38:36] I could find it. And I quickly realized that in my business life, I was not going to be successful.
[00:38:46] What business is the joy? Well, I first office, I started at a textile manufacturer and
[00:38:51] feel we were trying to get back to family because we had, you know, I had a new kid and probably
[00:38:57] another one on the way. So my wife at the time lived in South Jersey. So we went there.
[00:39:06] So I got a job, a textile manufacturer and Philly and they were great people. And I really liked
[00:39:13] the company and I was just terrible at it. You know, they wanted to start like a tactical
[00:39:18] product's line and I thought I'd try, you know, business and yeah, I didn't do well. I didn't do
[00:39:28] terrible, but I just like I don't, I don't know what I'm doing. So I started thinking about this
[00:39:33] right about then. I was like, there's only two things that I can do. And, you know,
[00:39:40] I don't want to leave the kid and all right, you know, at that time it was, you know, one kid
[00:39:45] had become two. So I started thinking about this. What was the catalyst that made you actually
[00:39:53] get out your computer, open the word processor and start typing?
[00:39:59] That was probably extortion one seven. So like everybody I went to, you know, you know,
[00:40:09] quite a few of the funerals after that. And I went to J. T. S. Funer of John Thomelson. He was,
[00:40:20] he was from the rockford Iowa. So I went to his funeral and totally unexpected. But when I was there,
[00:40:28] I met Jim Hornfisher or James D. Hornfisher. That's his author name, but he was a literary agent.
[00:40:36] And he was, but he was also a, probably the, you know, the greatest, you know, naval historian in the country.
[00:40:44] He had written last stand of the tin cancels, Neptune's in Fernow. So when I got to J. T. S. Funerl,
[00:40:51] everybody's there, he's drinking. I see this guy who's totally out of place. He's six foot five,
[00:40:57] you know, whereas glass is just kind of, not a team guy clearly. And one of my friends quickly,
[00:41:06] you know, realizes that, you know, he has the two biggest nerds at the event and he introduces us
[00:41:11] and was in 30 seconds. I knew that this was a guy that was going to change my life.
[00:41:18] So we started talking to the military. We got, got pretty little up, kept his business card in my pocket
[00:41:24] for the next year. It was kind of, you know, secretly working on an idea for a book.
[00:41:32] And after a year, I sent him a cold email and just, you know, here's a chapter. I want to take a look at it
[00:41:39] and he sent an email back and he said, this is fantastic. And I spent the next six months putting
[00:41:45] an outline together for what the rest of the book would look like. And he took that to New York and
[00:41:51] he got a contract. So they gave me a two-year contract, you know, the next eight years working on it.
[00:41:59] They gave you a two-year contract. Yeah. And you just kept saying,
[00:42:03] I just kept thinking going, I just got a contract. Yeah, no, it wasn't that. It was like, I just,
[00:42:09] you know, they wanted, they wanted a product that I quickly realized I couldn't give them.
[00:42:15] So I knew that, what did they want? They wanted a, they wanted a history of the, of the teams,
[00:42:20] but they wanted it done quickly. Like everybody, I mean, you can, so I knew that if I did that,
[00:42:27] then the history that I was going to write was going to be like every other history that
[00:42:31] I've been written on the teams sort of just wave tops. And I knew that it wasn't going to be written
[00:42:37] with any sort of intent beyond, you know, just my own interest in each of the events. I knew
[00:42:43] I knew that the, I knew the teams deserved something like this. I just didn't know how to do this.
[00:42:48] So I just kind of broke the whole thing down. I found a bunch of, I found two or three books that I
[00:42:56] really liked. I read each of them three or four times. One of them I went through and I literally
[00:43:02] outlined it, you know, not page by page, but like chapter by chapters. Like this chapter is doing this,
[00:43:07] this chapter is doing this. And I just sort of broke it down. How does this author?
[00:43:12] You know, when I found another author, how does this author introduce characters? How do they,
[00:43:18] you know, how do they just, you know, structure or how do they, you know, we've multiple storylines
[00:43:22] together. And I just kind of taught myself how to do this. Did you, but I knew, I knew that they,
[00:43:29] that, you know, this was going to take me a lot longer than two years. So when they gave you two years,
[00:43:34] what did you, did you just sign the contract and just sign the contract? No, is that you would,
[00:43:39] yeah, I did the same thing. I did it, sealed team five. You know, I said, yeah, I'm a con guy.
[00:43:43] I just, you said, you all right this in two years? Yeah. How pissed were they when you kept
[00:43:48] messing the deadline by five years? You know, two, they're credit. They didn't bother me.
[00:43:56] They would check in. And the only thing that they really did was, they, they wanted to see the first chapter.
[00:44:05] So once the first chapter was finished, I sent that off and they said, okay, this is, and I, it took me
[00:44:15] between six and seven months to write that first chapter on the Raiders. How many hours a day would you
[00:44:22] work? I would start at 430 and I would work until about eight. And then I would, you know, do
[00:44:30] rest of my day and then I'd come home, I'd get my kids to bed. And then once I put them to bed,
[00:44:37] I'd work as long as I couldn't till I was just kind of smoked. So you're probably getting like
[00:44:41] five, six hours a day on the book? Yeah. For, yeah. Yeah, I mean, I'll tell you what, we'll get into the book.
[00:44:51] Now, but before we do the book is freaking, it's, it's an incredible book and the detail you go into,
[00:44:57] it's over 500 pages long. I'll read a fraction of that today. It was so hard for me to
[00:45:05] figure out what to, what parts to read. I guess I could have talked to you about it. Maybe we could
[00:45:13] have discussed it, but I just kind of like, every page has got really important stuff on it.
[00:45:19] The writing's terrific, clearly and unmistakably you sourced it from a lot of first-person accounts,
[00:45:27] you know, capture documents, or information captured from documents, from official traffic,
[00:45:33] from interviews, from other sources. It reads like an action novel in many parts,
[00:45:39] except for the fact that it's all true, which makes it even better to read. So this book, I can't
[00:45:44] recommend this book enough, just a fantastic history. And it's not, it's not just about the
[00:45:49] seals because one of the premises of the book is that seals wouldn't exist if either really the
[00:45:58] Marine Corps or the Army would have stuck to and committed, committed to the idea of having
[00:46:09] these kind of direct action raiders, which is what the seal teams ends up being. And everybody's got
[00:46:15] it kind of got it now, you could say, but for many years there was many attempts at doing this,
[00:46:21] and they wouldn't work out for various reasons. Maybe a mission would go bad or a war would end
[00:46:29] or a combination of those two things, or you know, when you're in the Army and you're a general,
[00:46:33] when you got some cowboy looking guy running around, and you're senior to that cowboy looking
[00:46:39] guy, you think I don't want this guy running around? I'm going to disband his whole organization,
[00:46:44] or you're in the Marine Corps, you do the same thing. Hey, you know, I was in the Marine Corps,
[00:46:48] Marine Corps is right in tight, you know, and now who's this guy running around with freaking
[00:46:52] long hair? No, I'm going to disband that whole organization, and that seems to happen a lot. There's
[00:46:57] one group, the Navy, where you're in the Navy, so you're sort of, you know, if you're to
[00:47:04] add real Navy, you kind of want to have some of these pipe editors running around that can make
[00:47:10] something happen, and that's, I think, part of the, part of the genesis of the seal teams. So,
[00:47:17] book is fantastic. Let's get into some of this. So, here we go. On August 8th,
[00:47:26] at 0900, both submarines departed sub-based Pearl Harbor and made it for the open ocean.
[00:47:31] It was in the lead was the notalist with Carlson and 87 Raiders of B company, following almost a
[00:47:38] day behind was the larger and slower Argonaut with Roosevelt and the remaining 134 men,
[00:47:44] the majority belong to A company. For eight, sweltering days, the Raiders lived crammed alongside
[00:47:49] each other, anywhere they could stretch each man, a prisoner to, to the heat, sweat, and stink of the
[00:47:55] one next to him. After 2,000 miles of the specifics omnipotent slightly farther than New York
[00:48:01] city to San Diego, the notalist finally arrived at its target on August 16th. So, these are marine
[00:48:06] Raiders. Group that have been put together to go out, they're conducting freaking sub-operations
[00:48:12] in World War II. Fast forward, and that's, you know, obviously I'm only reading chunks of the book.
[00:48:19] So, it seems a little bit stilled or, or you don't recognize some of the names. Believe me,
[00:48:25] every person that's in this book is described, you know, you give an incredible background on
[00:48:29] people where they came from, how they got in the situation they're in. So, when you hear me
[00:48:33] jumping, you haven't heard of a character, it's just because I haven't read, I'm not reading
[00:48:36] you the entire book. Fast forward a little bit, sensing his momentum, eroding like the ground beneath
[00:48:41] him Carlson, sloth through the soft sand, hastening to gather his men before the sun rose.
[00:48:46] Obviously, they've been inserted at this point. If he could find the, find an untangle,
[00:48:51] his two reduced companies, and point them in the direction of their targets, he might still have a
[00:48:55] chance. Because there had been no reconnaissance, however, no one knew for sure where, or where,
[00:49:02] where they were, or where to go, with four miles of beach to the left, and another six miles
[00:49:07] to the right, with targets, their targets could be anywhere, if their targets were there at all.
[00:49:13] We're still one whole boat crew is missing. Without target locations or knowledge of enemy strength,
[00:49:21] the 13 men, with 13 men on accountant for and possibly drowned, Carlson was blind and
[00:49:27] groping for answers in an ever-brightening world, his men becoming ridiculously conspicuous,
[00:49:32] along the white beaches in their uniforms of dyed black. So this is already off to a bad start
[00:49:38] with these guys. Yeah, they, uh, yeah, I don't know what to say. I mean, I, uh, the, um,
[00:49:50] right, organizing the book, I knew where I knew where I needed the book to end. I knew that the book
[00:49:58] would end in Vietnam because in Vietnam, it's in Vietnam that the seal teams become what they are
[00:50:02] today. Land focus, go anywhere, commandos. What he did know was how it happened, and I didn't have,
[00:50:09] like, you know, uh, in order to, you know, decide what a book's going to be, you've got to have,
[00:50:15] you know, not just an endpoint, you're going to have a beginning point. So I needed to find
[00:50:19] that first instance where the Navy, um, the Navy had that, uh, that desired to create some sort of
[00:50:28] rating unit. Now, we all know that, you know, the Marine Corps is a department of the Navy.
[00:50:35] So the Navy has its own army. Uh, and so logically, the Marine Corps should have been able to
[00:50:42] feel that first commando unit that worked directly for the Navy. The reason that they don't do
[00:50:47] that ultimately, uh, happens, you know, in the opening days of World War II, and all happens because
[00:50:54] of this make an island rate. The Marine Corps doesn't want the readers, uh, the, uh, the Marine
[00:50:59] Corps wants what it's always wanted, or, or not what it's always wanted. They want what they've
[00:51:03] wanted since World War I. And World War I, the Marine Corps, uh, becomes every bit as, uh,
[00:51:10] consequential as the US Army. So the leaders of the Marine Corps who all fought on the battlefield,
[00:51:14] the first World War, they feel like when World War II happens, uh, they can finally, uh, achieve
[00:51:19] the status that their service has long, uh, uh, uh, deserved. So they're not interested in, uh,
[00:51:25] being the Navy's anything. They're, they're, they're, they're interested in being their own branch
[00:51:29] of service completely, uh, uh, uh, uh, you know, subservient to themselves. Uh, so when the Navy says,
[00:51:36] they want to, uh, spread the Japanese, uh, attention away from the Solomon's or away from the South
[00:51:42] Pacific and do this raid, Marine Corps thinks well, it's, you know, it's not really what we should
[00:51:46] be doing, but we'll do it just because the Navy wants it. So when it, it predictably, uh, when they
[00:51:51] send, uh, these raiders up there, uh, with a, uh, commander that the Marine Corps really didn't want
[00:51:57] it. They really didn't like Carlson. Uh, it, it goes predictably bad and then the Marine Corps just
[00:52:04] ifies the reason, uh, that they never wanted them in the first place. It's, it's interesting, um,
[00:52:09] even when, and I don't know if you'll remember this because it might be a little bit, but you
[00:52:14] didn't come in until 2000. Yeah, when I came in, the, the, the Marine Corps attitude was, what we don't
[00:52:22] need a special operations group inside the Marine Corps because all Marines are special.
[00:52:27] Yeah, and that's that was a 200% their attitude and they kept that, like, to the T when I was in,
[00:52:34] that was, that was just how they rolled, was, was through that. Um, yeah, I mean, they, they have
[00:52:42] had that attitude since the first, well, since World War II, but it's in the first world,
[00:52:46] they, they, they realized what they can be. Yeah, which is a parallel army. You, uh, the, the, the,
[00:52:55] the work that you did to research these, these battles and you go into so much detail with them.
[00:53:00] I mean, here we go and back to the book real quick, um, for the next 30 minutes, a company
[00:53:05] fought a suicidal enemy armed with four machine guns, two grenade throwers, automatic rifles,
[00:53:10] and a flame thrower. Each time the Raiders managed to silence a machine gun, nest another
[00:53:13] Japanese gun, which step over the piled bodies surrounding it and bring it to life.
[00:53:17] Worst of all unseen and inscapable were the snipers, last to the tops of the palms,
[00:53:22] not blinded by the sun and rewarded for their patients. Each sniper sought out, movement and took
[00:53:27] aim. We pleaded with Thompson to stay down one man remembered years later, there were snipers
[00:53:32] within 50 yards of us. He did not compelled instead to shuttle between his men pointing out
[00:53:37] targets as he went. His metal of honor was awarded posh, mostly. We had japs in front of us,
[00:53:43] above us, alongside us, to our left and behind us remembered Corporal Young, exposed at the
[00:53:49] tip of the cold asak, even when they managed to fight free of the Japanese around them,
[00:53:54] their good sense kept them nailed to the ground. I lay as fat as flat as I could and tried to
[00:53:59] shrink myself as narrow as possible, said private Glenn Lincoln, playing possum under the palm trees
[00:54:04] and the scrutiny of two separate machine gun positions. In 30 minutes, nine Raiders from second
[00:54:09] platoon were dead. So was Thompson. So was Lieutenant Jerry Holtham, the battalion intelligence officer,
[00:54:17] a child of missionaries and the one Raider who could speak Japanese. Also killed were four
[00:54:22] radio telephones operators, each one singled out by the antenna wagling above his shoulder,
[00:54:27] which was connected to a waterlogged radio that either lacked the power to reach Carlson's command
[00:54:32] post or did not work at all. So like you said, this is just a disaster. This situation.
[00:54:42] It's a disaster, but it highlights even though each branch of service has leaders that have
[00:54:49] their own purposes for creating these units at various times for various reasons. In each
[00:54:55] instance, whether it's Raiders or Rangers or Lerps or whatever, the guys on the ground,
[00:55:03] these are, I mean, every bit is heroic and deserving of our respect as the seals that their
[00:55:13] legacy is ultimately funnel into. So the branches of service don't support their efforts.
[00:55:22] Now for one various reasons, it takes a long time to get there. But you're right, you said it,
[00:55:28] you're opening remarks. I mean, this history or this institution, the seal teams,
[00:55:33] could not have come to be, would not have come to be a landfocus command or unit,
[00:55:40] had it not been for the gap that the Army and the Marine Corps and the CIA were the OSS
[00:55:45] continually provide over this 30-year period of history. So that kind of, as you mentioned,
[00:55:52] that kind of, that first raid that making raid kind of put a, put a damper on the enthusiasm
[00:55:58] of the Marine Corps to go out and make one of these units. Fast forward a little bit, you say this,
[00:56:07] in the book, in May 1942, an anticipation of the Army's need, the Navy issued a narrow call for
[00:56:12] volunteers to join something called the amphibious commandos. What made the call narrow was that it
[00:56:18] seemed to be directed at a single group. That group was, in the words of one reported, the 600 or so
[00:56:23] quote, educated muscle men who had signed on as assistant instructors to the Navy's physical fitness
[00:56:30] program. These were led by the most educated muscle man of his day, Lieutenant Commander James
[00:56:35] Joseph Green, Tony, I'm saying that right, Tony, Tony, Tony, six feet tall, equipped with heavy
[00:56:42] fist shape chin and handsome smile that every man, woman and child in the country recognized,
[00:56:47] Tony was known, wait did I get that right, Tony, you're Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony,
[00:56:52] Tony was known as the great war machine turned heavyweight boxing champ who had not once but twice
[00:56:57] defeated Jack DMC. Unlike many boxes of his day who's training consisted of in the words of one
[00:57:02] competitor, a haircut and a shave, Tony had managed this feat by relentlessly conditioning
[00:57:07] his body during the day and by reading Shakespeare every night. After winning his second fight,
[00:57:12] Tony had fought only once more, then quit the ring forever to follow what, to follow that irresistible
[00:57:18] pull as one contemporary reported, no reporter noted to do something big in other fields.
[00:57:25] This had included lecturing on Richard III at Yale and inventing the gene,
[00:57:30] Tony, exercise or a long board equipment, a long board equipped with ropes and pullies that
[00:57:36] would raise the feet and condition the abdomen's it sold for $3.
[00:57:44] Biggest of all, he had swapped his old global anchor for the bronze oak leaves of a naval officer
[00:57:49] in order to rid his new service of what he considered its greatest threat, the pot belly.
[00:57:53] I dare say that 50% of the officers in listed men cannot properly stand at attention said
[00:58:00] the newly commissioned Tony in 1941, partly blaming their ill-fitting dungries, which stretched
[00:58:05] too much and induced the wearer to stick out his belly and hold them up. Tony reasoned that the
[00:58:10] problem was actually a threat to national security, then would eventually lead in his words to
[00:58:16] moral collapse. Believing like all Marines that a strong physique undergirded a strong character,
[00:58:21] Tony's initial efforts in the navy had met with only moderate success because sailors were
[00:58:27] not Marines and as such had never cared much for either fitness or character.
[00:58:36] Yeah, you're dry ho humid comes through a lot in this book. I had to cut. I don't know,
[00:58:41] probably five sex pages of Tony out. I mean, the one problem that you face when you're writing a
[00:58:48] book like this is that you research is really seductive. You can go down rabbit hole after rabbit hole.
[00:58:54] Keep going. You keep going. You find article after article after article and you want to
[00:58:58] you want to cram all this information into that into that paragraph and it doesn't take anywhere.
[00:59:04] So you constantly have to be asking yourself, what is this? First of all, what's the book?
[00:59:09] I kept a note card on my desk when I started working on the book and the note card had three
[00:59:13] questions on it. It was pinned to the wall. It said, what's the purpose of the book? What's the
[00:59:19] purpose of the chapter? What's the purpose of this paragraph? And if the paragraph is not in
[00:59:24] support of the chapter and if the chapter is not in support of the book, then you're not, you're
[00:59:29] doing it wrong. So, every character that you come across, you want to give them some sort of
[00:59:37] introduction. Tony's consequential and that he attracts all of these studs. Yeah, he brings all of these
[00:59:46] studs. But he doesn't have the program that's going to be able to contain these guys. So he
[00:59:52] attracts all of these, you know, pro football players to his program that they all want to, you know,
[01:00:00] serve their country, you know, in the most aggressive way possible and they find out that they're
[01:00:05] going to be calistening instructors. So of course, you know, what's going to happen. So Tony collects
[01:00:12] all these guys and then, you know, I think the, go ahead. Yeah, it's, it's, you know, I've done a lot of
[01:00:20] reading about sag and every, basically, I would say every sag mission in Vietnam could be its own book.
[01:00:27] And just want every single sag mission. And that's the feeling I get when, when reading your
[01:00:32] book, every one of these characters that you introduce could be their own book. Yeah, just about
[01:00:37] every single character could be their own book. You just have to stop. You've got to, you've got to
[01:00:42] draw the line at some point. You'd be like, yes, there's a book here clearly, but we're, you know,
[01:00:47] we're going on to, you know, the subject. I never wanted to write a book with a thesis. I was never
[01:00:52] my objective. I didn't want to prove anything. But what I did find was that with the thesis,
[01:00:57] with the thesis, I was able to connect all these disparate stories. Right. Never would have
[01:01:02] formed a, you know, a comprehensive story. Mm-hmm. But with that thesis, by asking the question,
[01:01:08] how did the Navy come to create a land focus going to a work of a, I was able to stitch all these
[01:01:13] other, you know, Rangers and Raiders and all the other stories of, you know, the non-seal units
[01:01:18] into a book about the seals. So here's another character that you introduce,
[01:01:22] um, that we all in the seal teams. No. When 28-year-old Phil Bucklew, a football star from
[01:01:30] Columbus, Ohio had presented himself at an Army recruitment office immediately after Pearl Harbor
[01:01:34] to volunteer for the pair of troopers. The recruiter had taken one look at his six foot two,
[01:01:37] 235 pound frame and said, I could, I could take two instead of you, considering that the smallest
[01:01:43] soldier the army could accept was a shadow heavier than 105 pounds of recruiters absolutely right.
[01:01:48] Disappointed to be passed up for the pair of troopers and thus loses chance to be dropped into a
[01:01:53] foreign land, Bucklew had settled for the Navy. Then settled again for the, for the Tone program,
[01:01:59] ostensibly the best place in the military for someone with his background. After playing for Xavier
[01:02:05] University in Cincinnati and then the ramp for the Rams in Cleveland, Bucklew had since gone
[01:02:10] on to raise money and recruit players for his own professional football team,
[01:02:13] accomplishments that had demonstrated not only intelligence and toughness that Tone sought,
[01:02:17] but also leadership and the risk taking of an entrepreneur. He was not the only footballer with
[01:02:23] hidden potential. Big John Trips in a six foot five bushy-haired all-American from Mississippi State,
[01:02:30] had already seen more of the country than most Americans ever would, having traded his life
[01:02:34] on the South Texas planes to play all-protackle for the Detroit Lions and Robert Herrick,
[01:02:39] a mountain of muscle from the mountains of Colorado, who stacked every bit as high as his Texas
[01:02:44] colleague had enlisted in the Navy not only as a graduate of Colorado State, but as it's head football
[01:02:50] coach. Essentially he was a roster with more potential than Tone's program contained.
[01:02:57] It's just a bunch of freaking beasts. Got it, got to read this part too.
[01:03:01] So at the call for amphibious commandos, Bucklew and nine other tight-knath leads raise their hands
[01:03:08] when they reported to their next assignment, Achief Petty Officer with a knowledge of angling
[01:03:11] and the Toney regime took one look at the oversized arrivals and dubbed them the tuna fish.
[01:03:21] The name stuck. You get another guy named Halperon in here who plays a huge role in all this.
[01:03:30] Yeah, he's indispensable. I mean, everybody, you know, the temptation when you're writing about these
[01:03:41] guys is to introduce them as they come. You know, you come to Bucklew. You want to introduce Bucklew
[01:03:45] because Bucklew is one of the most important people in the history of NSW. You come to him.
[01:03:52] You want to give him a good, you want to give him him the introduction that he deserves, but he doesn't
[01:03:56] become, he doesn't become Phil Bucklew. The consequential Phil Bucklew until Vietnam. So you've got
[01:04:03] to hold your fire and you've got to, you know, sort of convince the reader that if you just hold on,
[01:04:09] we're going to get there. So because the most consequential person, person of this period,
[01:04:15] is the guy you just mentioned, is Bucklew. Yeah, you get this guy Bucklew,
[01:04:18] Pernet, a mere six feet, 225 pounds. Guess what monsters? This is back in the day, too. This is
[01:04:23] freaking, like World War II. Guys are not jacked. Like they are now. Well, if you're six foot
[01:04:29] six feet, 225 back in the day, you are jacked. 100%. Echo, can you confirm? From the
[01:04:36] bro science perspective. Okay. This may be true. At a mere six feet, 225 pounds, Robert Buck
[01:04:43] Halperon was easily the smallest of the group. But stood out from his fellow footballers for a
[01:04:48] string of peculiarities, not the least of which a face, not unlike that of Holly Woods, Robert Taylor.
[01:04:54] Besides this, he was half a decade older than the rest and had a personality that was not only
[01:04:58] his dry as Cabernet, but also incomparably unflappable. Most peculiar of all, he'd been raised and
[01:05:04] educated in the exclusive Chicago suburb of Oak Park, the second son of prominent Jewish immigrants
[01:05:10] at the time, not exactly features that encouraged friendships with working class white footballers,
[01:05:14] but trying telling that to Halperon. Unlike the son of Jewish immigrants, unlike many
[01:05:19] sons of Jewish immigrants, Halperon had been raised to speak no yetish to practice no faith. A boy
[01:05:24] so adrift from any spiritual anchor that he adopted two regional substitutes as his sanctuaries.
[01:05:30] The first had been Lake Michigan in which he swam so often and so well that he once
[01:05:34] caught the admiration of awaiting Al Capone. And upon which he had learned to sail, eventually
[01:05:39] reading the Wendy city's win so well that he had taken up competitive racing. The other sanctuary,
[01:05:44] a high, holy place if there ever was one had been the Notre Dame football stadium.
[01:05:50] Asked why a Jew would submit himself to such a Christian university, Halperon had flatly replied
[01:05:56] because it was the best. So this is another guy. Yeah, he just a character.
[01:06:06] And he starts, I mean he starts from nothing. He doesn't, he has no expectation. He's so old
[01:06:11] when World War II starts. He's 34 years old when he enlists his assignment in the Navy.
[01:06:18] But his brother had been a radiologist at Pearl Harbor. And so after you're seeing your brother,
[01:06:26] you know, performing such service, what else you know, you've got to do the same. So he
[01:06:31] pulls every string and can get himself into the Navy. And I don't know. I don't want to
[01:06:39] give anything away, but he, I mean he goes from the Tony program all the way to China. I mean he
[01:06:45] becomes NSW's first ground force commander. It's friggin nuts.
[01:06:50] Um, last week of 1942, Buck Halperon in the rest of the tuna fish, plus 36 enlisted sailors left
[01:06:59] the Solomon Islands where they were trucked more than 100 miles to a point where the lower lip
[01:07:04] of the Chesapeake Bay met the Atlantic Ocean. Here, the Virginia Coast gave way to an isolated
[01:07:09] tidewater inlet called Little Creek and a dirt road based with dirt floor housing that made the
[01:07:14] Solomon's look like San Francisco upon arrival they were greeted by an army officer. Lieutenant
[01:07:20] Lloyd Petticoord Jr. 29 year old former commander of the observer group who now wore knee-high
[01:07:26] leather boots of a horse soldier and in spite of a small stature when standing at attention
[01:07:31] look like a nail waiting to be driven into a rail tie. His personality wasn't far off as one of
[01:07:37] the few soldiers who had participated in Marine Corps Flex exercises, he knew all two other
[01:07:41] challenges awaiting the men. He now welcomed to the intensely difficult course he had just created
[01:07:46] a course of soft sand runs rubber boat races and endless team calisthenics known as the
[01:07:52] joint army navy amphibious scouts in radar school at last the navy's volunteers for amphibious
[01:07:58] commandos were about to come them. That's sort of the beginning and there's something you know
[01:08:05] what's interesting I don't know I'm thinking if you do those like psychological games where
[01:08:12] or psychological tests where somebody says something and it makes you think of whatever you
[01:08:16] know you have to say what it means but when you hear amphibious commando who's not 100% in all
[01:08:22] that way. Like when I think I knew it at amphibious commando is when I was five years old and wanted
[01:08:28] in you know. I had I collected these little air fix soldiers the little one 30 second size
[01:08:39] little army men when I was a kid my mom eventually threw them all the way by the way
[01:08:43] just a savage I had a hundred of them and I used to you know dream and talk and play with those
[01:08:50] things but my favorite was the British commandos the Adli LaZodiacs and and kayaks and little
[01:08:55] a beany caps like that was the deal and you see that was when I was a little kid that was like
[01:09:01] a hair amphibious commandos. So again I can't read so much I know but yeah a pedicure like he's
[01:09:12] a each of the people that I focus on in the book. I tried to drill down as close as I could you know
[01:09:28] there's you know the general of thumb as you start big and you go small so you read whatever
[01:09:33] is available you the existing literature that's out there and there have been there have been a
[01:09:39] couple of books that have been published in pedicure it's a character so you kind of trace those down
[01:09:43] you know pedicure it out from buckley whatever you're trying to get as close you can to
[01:09:48] the person that you want to write about or the the person that becomes the consequential person
[01:09:53] of the moment so you're trying to learn about them and such a way that you can find out the
[01:09:58] traits in that person that made them consequential and whether the traits that made you know somebody
[01:10:05] like Carlson, a failure or the traits that made pedicure to buckler or hauntburn success so oftentimes
[01:10:12] you'd hit a wall there's no place you know there's no more information that's available
[01:10:18] and existing literature so you've got to start digging into you know archival material so I had
[01:10:23] learned pretty quickly you know what archives around the country usually had the most stuff so I
[01:10:29] would go to those archives and I would dig. But where does this place you got to go to like yeah so
[01:10:34] the libraries or something yeah so the archive that I generally used about five different archives
[01:10:39] the most the best one was probably the National Archives in Maryland they
[01:10:48] they have the most stuff and they have the it's accessible when you start getting to the military
[01:10:55] archives that that the army so much the army archives is actually really a world class institution
[01:11:00] I loved going there that's in Carl and the Marine Corps archive in Quantico another another great
[01:11:07] archive the Navy yard it or the naval heritage and history command our archive at the Navy yard
[01:11:15] that was a bit trickier they had for whatever reason I think a lot of it had to do with the fact
[01:11:22] that they had a active shooter there a few years before so security on the on the base was tight
[01:11:27] but they would really so very close held institutions so when you went there you know digging
[01:11:32] through their stuff could be a little complicated you had to plan around it but you'd find stuff you'd
[01:11:38] find you know I found letters the pedic ordered written you've got to really you've got to look
[01:11:45] at the letter you've got to read it once you know highlight what's important and you've got to read it
[01:11:49] again and again and figure out you know what you can learn about him from the letter at the way
[01:11:54] talks the way it writes the way he thinks when you run into that when you can't you know squeeze
[01:12:00] any more information out of that then you're left with find in the family and you know in this
[01:12:08] case I found pedic words family I tried to find you know at least a family member for every you
[01:12:13] know person that I you know focused on on the book had dinner with buck Alprens son last night
[01:12:21] still close friends with him but pedicors family you know some of these people they don't
[01:12:26] realize like how important their dad or their grandfather was in the history and they have no idea
[01:12:34] why you're calling them and they you know that you know they they would provide photos they provide
[01:12:40] letters sometimes they would let you come to their house and dig through their stuff
[01:12:43] um yeah pedicord was one of those that I didn't expect to find as much as I did but talking to
[01:12:53] them I mean you can get little details I don't my fun one photo of pedicord wearing those boots
[01:13:00] and I knew that they were you know the boots that army cavalry soldiers wore
[01:13:07] and I didn't anticipate that they were boots that he wore you know through the rest of his career
[01:13:12] until I ran into an old scout and raider I was a 96-year-old guy old Jim Barnes what they call them
[01:13:20] I was like you know I'd sat down to interview Jim Barnes and I you know what do you remember about
[01:13:24] pedicord and the first thing that he remembered were those boots
[01:13:30] yeah little details
[01:13:35] after this here you you detail you go through some of the details of operation towards which is
[01:13:41] up in North Africa the Sabu River it's it's success you know it's a tough operation
[01:13:53] five of the 10 original tuna fish get the navy cross from that operation and again I'm skipping
[01:13:59] through some of that right now get the book get the book and read about that freaking operation because it's epic
[01:14:04] um the origination you know we've said this a couple times but the origination of everything that
[01:14:13] goes on here is is you you have to tell talk about the raiders you have to talk about the rangers you
[01:14:21] have to talk about why why why what happened to them and why they didn't become seals
[01:14:28] or at least this seal type thing this is a section here where you start talking
[01:14:33] about um well the rangers so the premise is you know that the navy should never have had this capability
[01:14:42] when I started trying to come up with a title for the book I warn the my options for sub-pitals
[01:14:47] were like something like the origin story the navy seals at unit that should not exist something
[01:14:51] like that something is you know provocative like like that and the reason they shouldn't exist
[01:14:57] is because of the army and the marine queen the industry I all of these institutions were
[01:15:01] better suited for this mission than the navy was uh so in order to you know explain the
[01:15:08] question that I you know ask at the beginning how the navy you know come to field this you know land
[01:15:13] focus go anywhere commando for us um the way that's phrased is you have to understand why these
[01:15:19] other institutions didn't uh become that first why they didn't block the navy from becoming that
[01:15:24] and only in understanding why they didn't become that can you understand really understand why
[01:15:28] the navy did it why the navy felt like it had to do it that includes the rangers going to the book
[01:15:36] the officer selected to command the rangers 31 year old major William Orlando Derby born in
[01:15:42] Fort Smith our can saw in 1911 the same guerrilla studded year as Lord Lovat and Russell Volkman
[01:15:51] Derby grew up believing that he was destined for greatness of average size and looks as
[01:15:54] greatness laid below the surface as it as it is so often with tragic men a war would be to
[01:16:00] require to uncover it black hair blue eyed wide mouth as a duck Derby had a ruddy face divided
[01:16:06] into equal parts forehead and chin his left cheek borham mysterious brilliant red scar not particularly
[01:16:14] muscular he nevertheless affected chest out shoulders back posture in which his arms seemed
[01:16:20] to always cock to the rear as if never more than a moment away from snapping to attention son of a
[01:16:25] printer and a musician the second child between two sisters he grew up scouting the Arkansas
[01:16:30] woods and playing the saxophone while in high school his older sister died in Texas he
[01:16:37] married then divorced in spite of disappointment and tragedy his attitude remained as it ever
[01:16:42] had been good humored and irrepressible in personality just like his posture he was direct
[01:16:47] forceful and never vacillating had the military gnaut dominated and given and driven him to a life
[01:16:54] of soldiering he would have made a born salesman he is the ideal commando leader wrote Colonel Vaughn
[01:17:01] at the end of the course he possesses the energy keenness and personality which produces the best
[01:17:06] out of those under his command graduated from west point in 1933 at the apex of the bell curve
[01:17:11] ranked 177 out of 346 he was originally assigned as a field artillery officer fast forward a
[01:17:18] little bit if the ideal army officer was equal parts confidence bravery energy and obedience
[01:17:25] Darby was all these things but perhaps too much the last more than anything he believed his men
[01:17:31] could and should perform any mission assigned to them from the most audacious lightning raids to the
[01:17:36] most ignominious re-rational on duties to the most spectacular seized season hold operations
[01:17:43] because of this no one would be more responsible for proving the value of the Rangers
[01:17:49] or for their downfall so you go into talking about their first experience the Rangers first
[01:17:58] combat experience who choose in deep yeah yep yeah that's I think I say France 1942 yeah and that
[01:18:09] that that one sentence that I give depth that represents 20 pages of book that I had to cut out
[01:18:16] like I spent like I said the research is really seductive I mean you find something that is so
[01:18:22] you know what you think is meaningful or what you think you know sort of shows you the direction
[01:18:30] that this whole thing is going in you I mean the temptation is to really really focus on it
[01:18:35] and drag your reader through this but you have to remember that you know you're trying to
[01:18:42] get the reader someplace and you don't want a frontload of chapter with 20 pages of battle
[01:18:46] and introduce characters in this battle or of this battle they're really not going to take
[01:18:50] anywhere they're also epic speaking of British commandos jockels perhaps inspiration
[01:18:57] for being a commando himself you got this quarter I'm just gonna read one quote this is what the
[01:19:01] Ranger said about the about the commandos that they went into gap with my god those commandos
[01:19:08] can fight remember one Ranger after the battle they'd kneeled down or lie down and fire
[01:19:11] then stand up grab an apple off a tree and start firing again freaking brits
[01:19:16] um so you go through that raid you go through another raid was even more dramatic victim of a
[01:19:22] winch that broke while lowering his landing craft dumping him as radios and equipment back into the
[01:19:26] ocean darby nevertheless scrambled back apart as boat then led four companies plus one chaplain
[01:19:32] ashore their despite squelching wet boots he and his Rangers marched uphill for three miles every
[01:19:37] man carrying a full loadout of ammunition plus fighting knives band that's climbing ropes one stick
[01:19:42] a dynamite and two mortar rounds the two unluckiest also pushed a muel cart bulging with still more
[01:19:48] mortar rounds when the Rangers arrived at fort denored they found it was surrounded by concentric
[01:19:54] search circles of barbed wires high as eight feet in his deepest 14 with every snip each man's
[01:19:59] nerves nerves since tighter just as they were about to reach the last ring a machine gun
[01:20:04] barked and drove them to the ground darby every the artillery man wasted no time really pull up
[01:20:10] your pull your company back a few yards then hit him when the barrage stops we tenip Murray had got
[01:20:15] had hardly got his men untangled from the wire when the first rounds bumped into the battlements
[01:20:20] thus persuaded the French defenders abandoned their machine guns and retreated chased by Murray
[01:20:25] and his Rangers shouting high-ho silver away that's fighting against the um the French the
[01:20:34] Vici French yeah fast forward a little we got had not I mean the when you read that and when you
[01:20:43] when you think about the Rangers it just reinforces everything I said before the seals should not
[01:20:49] exist yeah when you have you know what is clearly a naval commando force go anywhere commando force
[01:20:56] as capable as the Rangers were in 1942 this is a capability the army had they created it they were
[01:21:03] smart enough to create it and then they lost sight of the reasons that they created it and
[01:21:08] are actually the lose side of the reasons the the reasons that they created it are the reason
[01:21:14] that they had the downfall they didn't care about you know the Rangers commando capability there
[01:21:19] were more preoccupied with using the Rangers as a way to teach the rest of the army how to fight
[01:21:25] we want to integrate our Rangers with British commandos because the British commandos are really
[01:21:30] the only English speaking troops on the planet that knew how to fight they wanted to you know
[01:21:36] George Marshall wants to take that experience and pass it along to the rest of the US infantry
[01:21:41] or the army infantry and so by the time that the infantry starts to you know elevate itself to
[01:21:49] the the capabilities of the Rangers then divisional commander start using the Rangers more is not
[01:21:56] uh commandos to go you know radar uh on artillery position or command post they just start pushing
[01:22:02] them ahead of the infantry uh the homeless sort of like suicidal spearheaders and when you know
[01:22:08] the chapter ends I mean it's it's just it's so depressing but so predictable
[01:22:16] let's get there this is a massive mission this is in uh sister and uh you go through
[01:22:29] I mean I'm gonna I'm gonna catch the last little bit of it you go through the battle you go through
[01:22:33] it unfolds I mean there's so many leadership lessons to learn in here obviously it's all about
[01:22:37] leadership all the time but not a leadership lessons that are in this book is incredible um
[01:22:43] kind of wrapping this up since he'd been blown off the top of a smoking tank dobson
[01:22:50] had somehow made it back to his men near the calica pre-calica pre-neigh house there while
[01:22:56] organizing another defensive perimeter he had taken more shrapnel is right throughout thigh
[01:23:00] now lying in a ditch next to a burning self-propelled gun whose artillery rounds continue to
[01:23:05] cook off around him he passed his command to captain Charles Shunstrom a Ranger
[01:23:11] since the aconnary days and Darby's tank killing comparison and Darby's tank killing companion
[01:23:19] at gala upon taking command Shunstrom unaggressive as aggressive a soldier as the
[01:23:26] US Army had ever produced short-up his position with several companies of the third battalion
[01:23:31] and even attempted a flanking movement to either break free of the encirclement or believe
[01:23:36] you're not take the town none of it worked at 1045 solid communications were finally established
[01:23:44] between Darby and Shunstrom's radio the care of which was now in the hands of captain
[01:23:49] Edward Kitchens kitsch to everyone who knew him who was set up in the first battalions make
[01:23:56] shift aid station and whose feet were gradually becoming more and more encumbered by wounded
[01:24:01] Rangers at 1115 Darby told kitsch to hold on and that the fourth battalion was making slow
[01:24:09] but steady progress 30 minutes later Darby re-edited his encouragement and even asked kitsch
[01:24:15] to put together a rescue party for third divisions reconnaissance company that reportedly
[01:24:21] had been captured in his vicinity maybe you can break up the thing and rescue them
[01:24:26] Darby said his suggestion is tone deaf as his original expectations.
[01:24:32] Operationally employed like infantry Darby's Rangers were now dying like them too.
[01:24:38] At the Calacarini House alone lay some 16 dead Rangers another 22 wounded and only five men
[01:24:46] still fighting barely three loaded weapons among them. That 1215 kitsch became so overwatt, overwrought
[01:24:56] and weeping that he could no longer make himself understood. Darby asked for another voice
[01:25:03] and kitsch quit the household together preferring to die outside in battle rather than
[01:25:08] trapped inside manning the radio. Grasping the receiver now was a hulking Ranger
[01:25:16] Master Sergeant Robert E. Holt from Brooklyn, New York one of Darby's originals.
[01:25:20] Some of the fellows are giving up Colonel said E. Holt his voice scratching out of the
[01:25:27] speaker box. We're awfully sorry they can't help it because we're running out of ammunition
[01:25:34] but I ain't surrendering and his farmhouse command post Darby became frantic.
[01:25:41] Don't let the boys give up he pleaded get the old men together and land for it.
[01:25:45] How many men are still with you? They're coming into the building now E. Holt replied gunfire
[01:25:52] snapping in the background we're out of ammo but they won't get us cheap so long Colonel
[01:25:57] maybe when it's all over I'll see you again. With a violent wham wham E. Holt's transmission
[01:26:05] cut out. Darby squeezed the handset and studied himself. Use your head and do what is best.
[01:26:14] You're there and I'm here unfortunately I can't help you.
[01:26:20] It's stung to say the words into the dead line his fourth battalion still a mile from
[01:26:24] Cisterna. But whatever happens God bless you God bless all of you.
[01:26:33] With the mention of God Darby's voice choked his eyes watered.
[01:26:36] E. Holt, I leave everything in your hands tell the men I am with them to the end.
[01:26:46] After a moment he set down the handset, bracing himself he wrapped his hands around a telephone
[01:26:52] receiver and called general trust Scott. It apparently was too much for them he said muffling
[01:26:58] his emotions replacing the receiver in its cradle. Darby asked his staff to leave the room.
[01:27:03] As enemy shells beat a steady tattoo around the house he crumpled into a chair, dropped his head
[01:27:11] into his arms and sobbed. Several minutes later Darby appeared outside his shoulders straight
[01:27:21] and his chin thrust forward defiantly. He was still in command but in command of what?
[01:27:29] No one quite knew. I hate hearing that. This whole episode is based off a couple of sources.
[01:27:42] One of them being shunned. Shunstrums report that he wrote. I want to say three days
[01:27:46] that after the battle after surviving this thing he was one of the few that escapes
[01:27:51] and on a series of and on the radio transcription that they were keeping.
[01:27:56] Darby's headquarters. You can actually see everything that was said on that radio and you can read it
[01:28:06] and it's horrible. You know going into it where is going to happen and where
[01:28:16] it doesn't make it easier though. So despite these legendary heroics like you said,
[01:28:31] I mean the heroics of the troops are just undeniable just after World War II all six army range of
[01:28:37] Italians or Dispanthe. You say here, superficially modeled on Churchill's butcher and bolt commandos,
[01:28:45] the US Army Rangers by the time of their disbandment, look nothing like them. This was in the end
[01:28:51] the predictable result of different parents preoccupied with the readiness of his frontline soldiers.
[01:28:57] George Marshall had created the Rangers not to perfect the art of Churchill's coastal raids,
[01:29:02] but to serve his infantry. First by gaining battlefield experience that could be
[01:29:06] transferred to the rest of his troops second by handing them off to infantry commanders who
[01:29:10] committed the Rangers to missions within possible odds and then either blame them for their failures
[01:29:15] or diminish their uniqueness by using them no differently than regular infantry.
[01:29:21] Though no one could have guessed the consequences it was a prioritization that produced a
[01:29:26] lasting gap in the US military's order of battle for a unit that specialized in rating.
[01:29:31] One that could best be filled by a branch of service, less preoccupied, less preoccupied with
[01:29:38] this infantry and there was only one branch that didn't have infantry.
[01:29:45] So there you are setting up that one branch that doesn't have any infantry.
[01:29:51] Yeah at the time, there's only three branches. The Air Force doesn't exist yet, it's the army
[01:29:55] Air Corps. So of all three the army navy and the Marine Corps, navy's it. And you can see where this
[01:30:04] is going before you even get out of World War II. You can see the cycle that's going to
[01:30:09] continue all the way until Vietnam commanders are going to identify a gap. They're going to
[01:30:17] create commandos to fill that gap. They're going to commit them to action often to disastrous
[01:30:23] results and then they're going to renegade on their idea. They're going to pull the rug out from
[01:30:27] under these guys and every gap, every time that happens, it's often going to leave.
[01:30:32] They're that units commando partners in the lurch and always that commando partner is the US navy.
[01:30:39] And the navy's just going to get more frustrated, more frustrated, and they're going to continue
[01:30:43] pushing their units, their special units into that gap.
[01:30:46] Yeah, the next part of the book is called the opportunity chapter four, subtitled
[01:30:55] Draper Kaufman and the course that cracked the Atlantic wall then laid the first bricks of the
[01:31:00] legend of Naval Special Warfare.
[01:31:08] Here we go. These are weird.
[01:31:09] It's all in thin, lanky, even with dark hair, a narrow face and a chin that stretched down
[01:31:16] like a tear drop Draper Lawrence Kaufman also possessed poor teeth and spectacles as thick as
[01:31:21] sunmarine glass. Given to bouts of indolence, he was absent-minded of failure in any subject that
[01:31:28] not captures interest and alarmingly progressive on the issue of race, at least so fought his mother
[01:31:34] a shrew on the topic. As a young man, Kaufman had wanted nothing more than to attend the
[01:31:40] Naval Academy and commanded destroyer as his father had. When poor eyesight threatened to torpedo
[01:31:45] his dream, he submitted himself to the doctor's orders, however, medieval, and for one hour a day
[01:31:51] held a palm over each open eye. This, when his appointing congressman suddenly died, leaving
[01:31:58] his academy application in limbo, he told no one of his planned escape from his Connecticut
[01:32:02] boarding school got a bunk at the Washington DC YMCA and then walked the halls of Congress,
[01:32:08] slipping past secretaries and performing a rehearse sob story until someone anyone gave him an
[01:32:12] appointment. Once finally accepted, he rode crew, acted in school dramas and in cool for shadowing
[01:32:20] spent 30 days on a prison ship for sneaking off campus. When he graduated in 1933, a year
[01:32:26] when Navy Pinchers stalked the ranks looking for any excess ballast to pitch over the side,
[01:32:31] he was given his diploma and a physical disqualification from the Navy a steep four-year price
[01:32:35] to pay for to achieve the rank of civilian. Thus portrayed as child who dreamed Kaufman
[01:32:41] packed his pride, shelved any ideas of glory and settled for an onshore operation's job in
[01:32:46] the shipping industry, his life suddenly devoted to endless manifests for onloading and offloading
[01:32:51] of cargo. So there's your introduction to Draper Kaufman. I mean, just so many characters
[01:32:59] and this guy's definitely one of them gets put on a six-month assignment to Europe,
[01:33:03] while he's doing that that shipping job. While he's in Germany, he witnesses
[01:33:07] ain't all Hitler giving speeches, he realizes that this guy's what he realizes what's coming.
[01:33:13] Yeah. So fast forward a little bit, he decides he wants to go and
[01:33:19] serve in the American volunteer ambulance corps. To be accepted in the American volunteer
[01:33:24] ambulance corps, us adjunct unit of the French Army, one was first required to submit a
[01:33:28] downpane of $3,500 to cover living expenses in the cost of one ambulance. In 1940, that was
[01:33:34] almost the price of a house. Even more than alarming volunteers were bound to follow orders
[01:33:39] of French military to a man with purpose in his boots and adventure in his guts, just the sort
[01:33:44] of Hemingway. Hemingway is the French cause had attracted in the last war, no price was too high.
[01:33:51] And you say, actually it was too high. That was a big borrow and steel to get this money.
[01:33:56] Imagine you have to come up with the price of a house to go and serve in a freaking ambulance
[01:34:01] corps where you're going to get bombed a bone up, working for the French.
[01:34:05] Yeah. I mean, we all know the, you know, Draper Kaufman's sort of biography. I mean,
[01:34:10] every not everybody, but we get, you know, if you go to Buds, you're going to get the
[01:34:14] the Buds history class or the the steel history class. At some point, somebody going to
[01:34:18] mention Draper Kaufman. There was no, there was no Buds history class, there was no
[01:34:21] steel history class when I went through Buds. Do you say it? I'm saying there wasn't. I mean,
[01:34:26] it was 1990. So yeah, I know. And that's just going to make me mad if we talk about it.
[01:34:32] Yeah. No, but if you come across any sort of, any history book that's been written,
[01:34:37] Draper Kaufman's a character. And they're going to hit, you know, like I said,
[01:34:41] they're going to hit the wave tops of his biography. You know, before he becomes, you know, the,
[01:34:47] the indispensable character in the, in the UDTs, central Pacific campaigns. What they're not
[01:34:56] going to do is they're not going to put that biography in context. And when you really dig into it,
[01:35:03] like, you know, yes, we know he was an ambulance driver on the Western Front in 1940. We don't know
[01:35:08] what sacrifice it actually cost him to put himself in that position. And the reality is so much more,
[01:35:15] like me, I mean, you're right. I mean, he, you know, he, you know, he, you know,
[01:35:21] cached in everything he had, you know, to go do something that he believed in. Like how many people
[01:35:25] do you know, I don't know anybody like that today that would, you know, take away your house.
[01:35:30] Yeah, like, and it was all because he was just trying to, um,
[01:35:36] trying to do what he thought was right. He was trying to, you know, surface country, even though his
[01:35:40] country wouldn't take him at the time because he couldn't see anything. It's just, you know,
[01:35:46] you know, every character in this book, they have, you know, everybody wants to do something in the book,
[01:35:54] and most of them don't get to do the thing that they want. But all of us, we don't know,
[01:35:59] you know, what legacy we're going to have. And we don't know, like, what thing that we don't want
[01:36:06] to do that we have to do is going to be the most important part of our lives. And that's what happens
[01:36:10] with rape or coffman. He doesn't want to do any of this. It doesn't want to be an ambulance driver.
[01:36:14] He doesn't want to be a bomb disposal guy in the blitz. He wants to be a naval officer. He wants to be
[01:36:19] on a destroyer. They won't let him. So he does all these other things to try and live up to what his
[01:36:24] dad has done. And he ends up being, you know, he becomes a legend because of it. So just to dive into a
[01:36:32] little bit of coffman, what he did on May 10, 1940, coffman arrived at his post six miles beyond
[01:36:40] the protection of the magna forts in the Saur River Valley in the northeast shoulder, France, where
[01:36:46] where the borders come to a point and jump like a salient into the ravenous mouth of Germany.
[01:36:52] The same day Hitler launched 100 divisions through the Rden's force. As he, as he had known
[01:37:00] it would, the Second World War, had begun. And again, for two unrelenting weeks,
[01:37:07] Draper drove to the front picked up survivors and returned the inside of his ambulance slippery
[01:37:11] with blood. The whole while he sustained himself on bits of food and the horror of French cigarettes.
[01:37:17] The only sleep to be had was taken in snatches never in a bed and never with his boots off.
[01:37:23] Responding to the deliberate fire of German magunners, Bosch Barbarians, he called them.
[01:37:29] He and his fellow ambulance drivers began draping dark blankets over the side of their vehicles
[01:37:33] to cover the giant red cross emblems. By the end of his third week in combat,
[01:37:38] two ambulances had been shot out from under him and he had lost 10 pounds.
[01:37:44] This is what he gave his house worth of money to go do.
[01:37:48] On the afternoon of September 7, 1940, a thousand German planes attack London's and surrounding
[01:37:53] areas killing 400 men, women and children and wounding 1200 more. The next day, 412
[01:37:58] were killed, wounding nearly double that number. For 57 consecutive days,
[01:38:02] London was hit. Had he arrived any earlier, who knows what the Royal Navy's reaction would have
[01:38:07] been to his request as it happened as it always happened when opportunity meets courage.
[01:38:12] Draper arrived exactly the right moment. The day Draper caught him volunteered for the Royal
[01:38:16] Navy. He presented himself to the Admiralty at 9 o'clock in the morning. So he goes and volunteers
[01:38:22] to join the Navy. But because of his eyes, by five that afternoon young Draper Kaufman was a sub-lutent
[01:38:29] in his Majesty's Navy. The only one hitch, once again, he was barred from duty at sea.
[01:38:36] Several weeks into his new career, a German bomb landed just outside the hotel in which Kaufman
[01:38:40] was billeted. Had it detonated upon impact, Kaufman's story would have been buried with long
[01:38:44] with the hotel, another footnote in military history, nothing more. As it happened, the bomb hit
[01:38:50] did not, but did not detonate. It's only damage being a 30-foot tunnel gouged into the earth. Before
[01:38:56] long, an army bomb disposal team arrived, cordoned off the area and set to work. With hand tools
[01:39:01] alone, the squad painstakingly dug a path to the bomb and large the hole and short up the sides
[01:39:06] in case of collapse. The objective reached the bomb without disturbing it. Gently unscrew the fuse,
[01:39:12] winch the inert remains from the dirt and accompanied by police and accompanied by police or
[01:39:17] sirens. By police car sirens and loudspeakers, unexploded bomb coming through, transport the
[01:39:22] carcass to a nearby cemetery. This usually this method worked in case it did not. The entire
[01:39:28] bomb disposal team was killed. The next day, Kaufman volunteered for bomb disposal.
[01:39:35] For eight months from September 1940 to May 1941, Hitler waged a war on the British people.
[01:39:40] More than 40,000 civilians were killed, more than 100,000 were injured. The instrument of all
[01:39:44] this destruction was the bomb. Many of these weapons were defective or deranged as in they failed
[01:39:50] the detonate upon impact or were timed to detonate after a bomb disposal team had arrived.
[01:39:59] So that's what he ends up doing. He ends up doing this bomb disposal duty. After a while of
[01:40:05] doing that, he decides he's going to go back to the states once he's back into the states,
[01:40:08] Japanese attack. After two years of waiting, the United States was finally at war. In a few days,
[01:40:15] the message found Kaufman ordering him to get out to Pearl Harbor right now. Imagine that
[01:40:20] Japanese trickery extended beyond strategy and into engineering draper prepared for the worst.
[01:40:26] When shown the 500-pound bomb at Scofield Barracks, he sent everyone else to cover,
[01:40:31] then examined it, sketched it and telephones each nail biting step back to his controller.
[01:40:36] It had been dropped too low. He determined landing on its side instead of its nose.
[01:40:40] What he had visualized as an old-fashioned, oriental puzzle turned out to be the easiest
[01:40:46] job he'd ever had. I couldn't set that bomb off if I had a sledgehammer. He said later,
[01:40:50] to those who witnessed his the bespeckled master, push past the line of gawkers to single-handedly
[01:40:56] disarm the bomb, there were few actions as deserving of praise.
[01:40:59] A couple headlines. DC Man takes live, jab, balma park, gets navy cross, ran the headline
[01:41:06] in the Washington Post. All Florida will rejoice with re-radmult James L. Kaufman on being the
[01:41:12] father of Soworthy Assun. So there you go. That's where draper Kaufman comes from.
[01:41:20] Yeah, draper is, there's some folks in the that spent their lives looking at the history of
[01:41:37] naval special warfare. And they know more about this history than even I do. I mean, I specialized
[01:41:44] over the, you know, like I said, the period from World War II to the period of Vietnam. They have a
[01:41:49] even fuller account than I do. And one of the things that annoys them is that draper Kaufman
[01:41:57] has risen to this sort of, you know, like I said, legendary status. He's, you know, considered by many
[01:42:02] the, the father of America's Frogman. He's not. He doesn't, he doesn't create the UDT, he doesn't
[01:42:11] create the Frogman. He, he happens to be the pivotal person at multiple points in that history.
[01:42:20] But he's not the, he's not the godfather like everybody or not like many people have suggested
[01:42:26] that he is including his sister who wrote, you know, pretty decent biography of him. But like I
[01:42:33] said, he is, he is, he's a consequential person. What's also interesting about him is that he is,
[01:42:38] like everybody else in this book, is he is, he's making decisions or he, he's, he's deciding to do
[01:42:47] everything. He does, he's not a, he's not a victim of history. He's not writing a wave like, like a
[01:42:55] lot of people, you know, would suggest were all sort of doing. Like the, there's a, there's a,
[01:43:01] there's a metaphor that people use to describe the transformation of the seal teams. And that's the
[01:43:06] evolution. We've all seen that sort of painting at P's where you've got the, you know, the naked
[01:43:11] warrior crawling out of the surf and then you've got this sort of Vietnam guy sort of crouched and,
[01:43:15] you know, wearing his, a tiger strike fatigues, you know, all, and next to the, the seal and Iraq
[01:43:21] Rafghanistan wearing the body arm and everything. That they call that transformation, the evolution,
[01:43:27] sort of suggest though that this, that this transformation was one inevitable and that it didn't
[01:43:35] require the, the intent, the, all of these folks who have this consequential role in our history,
[01:43:46] had and they, they clearly had intent. I mean, when Draper's going through his history,
[01:43:51] or his biography, he's deciding that he's going to go serve in the French army. And when the,
[01:43:58] the Germans sent him home after he's released from the POW camp and they, you know, make him
[01:44:02] sign the stockament that he's going to go back to the states and he'll never take up arms against
[01:44:06] the German Empire again. He intentionally decides that he's not going to do that. He's going to
[01:44:12] go join the British Navy and he's going to continue, he continually does this and just like
[01:44:18] everybody in the book, they are, they're not victims. They're each of these characters. They all have
[01:44:24] agency and they all decide that they're going to do these things for whatever reason. Mostly it's
[01:44:30] the decision that they arrive at is to satisfy what they have decided is their version of
[01:44:38] relevance. There's a spot where you say basically, Draper Kaufman is not really the Godfather that
[01:44:48] people, some people give him credit for of the frogman, but such a consequential guy. He is a consequential
[01:44:57] guy and you're right. He's not the, he's not the, the father of America's frogman. Kelly Turner is
[01:45:02] a Kelly Turner creates the UDTs. Nobody would have done it in a pleasant for Kelly Turner. He wants
[01:45:06] the UDTs because the Marine Corps, every step they frustrate his plans to use reconnaissance troops.
[01:45:13] And Kelly Turner, he's, Kelly Turner wants to control everything in his orbit. And so he
[01:45:22] creates the UDTs to do just that. He's, the, the demolition is sort of secondary. He wants a
[01:45:27] reconnaissance force that he owns. And Draper just happens to be the vehicle for Kelly Turner's.
[01:45:35] You know, once we pick, we do pick up with with Draper Kaufman though. You say as such,
[01:45:43] who better start the Navy's underwater demolition course in the second world war than the
[01:45:46] man who'd seen the most of it. The man who'd seen the most of it, a sailor for whom no barrier
[01:45:50] ever held and who was about to squeeze his biography into a syllabus like none that had ever existed.
[01:45:57] To create the type of amphibious engineer that he envisioned, envisioned,
[01:46:01] Kaufman needed elbow room, like Pettacord before him, he found his elbows had ample space in
[01:46:07] four pierce Florida. To create such a unit, he would require students with, in his words, both
[01:46:14] temperamental stability and individual initiative. To that end, Kaufman insisted that candidates
[01:46:20] be subjected to very heavy physical training, very heavy, he emphasized again. As he knew from
[01:46:26] his own career, first in France, then in the blitz, this type of experience would show students
[01:46:30] that they could push beyond their physical limits, doing without sleep and food and warmth,
[01:46:35] and still function without their arms falling off. More important, training of such intensity,
[01:46:40] would create its in its students' sense of purpose and unity like nothing except actual war.
[01:46:50] Fast forward a little bit.
[01:46:53] Short on time, eager to screen out the obvious people that would not make it physically and
[01:46:58] long on his desire to simulate an experience that was as close to war as possible.
[01:47:04] Kaufman decided that all three problems could be solved by the same solution, one week of misery.
[01:47:12] Never reluctant to ask for help, he walked south along Tent Row until he came to the section
[01:47:18] reserved for the Scouts and Raiders. There still six months away from being transferred,
[01:47:23] Pettacord listened to Kaufman's proposal. He had never been asked to compress the Scouts and
[01:47:28] Raiders' eight week physical training, conditioning course into one block of uninterrupted training.
[01:47:34] Certainly men could be pushed indeed nearly broken, but what Kaufman had asked to do was
[01:47:39] another matter. In the end, Pettacord agreed, what else could he do? This was Kaufman, the C's
[01:47:45] parted at his arrival. What Pettacord did not know, no one did, was that he was about to help create
[01:47:52] the sacramental cup from which nearly all future naval commandos would drink.
[01:48:01] You were wet, chafed with sand, just completely miserable. Remember, Frank Kane years later,
[01:48:08] in the daytime men melted under the sun. At night, they shook so hard from the wet and cold
[01:48:12] that their hip flexors swelled and cramped. Their teeth chattered like jack hammers,
[01:48:17] shouldering boats, sloshing with water, they marched for miles and sand and dunes that collapse
[01:48:22] beneath every step. Soden fatigues adhered to the grit and sand,
[01:48:28] turning armpits, thighs, and scrotums into raw meat. If any instructor detected a student
[01:48:35] on the stealth and concealment problem, as he warmed his, his chafed and dripping body
[01:48:41] to the plantation house, the man was punished by being sent to sit inside where swarms of mosquitoes,
[01:48:47] feasted on his misery. In addition to simple surf drills, rubber boat training included hours
[01:48:53] of paddling while harassed by the nearby air squadrons F4 pilots who would try to nail the
[01:48:59] floating rafts with sacks of flower bombs. Jettie landings and night portages were attuned by
[01:49:06] based ambulances and performed over boulders as broad as dinner tables, the endless surf smashing
[01:49:12] the panels and men against the rocks. Intended to simulate the long drain of campaign march
[01:49:17] before battle, this seemingly endless harassment ultimately culminated in a day-long mock skirmish
[01:49:24] known as the extended order problem or to the students so-solid day. Beginning before dawn,
[01:49:32] students raced off the ramps of their landing craft just as the beach erupted in fundering sheets
[01:49:37] of flame. For a whole day instructors armed with charges on least a torn of exploding
[01:49:43] columns of water and showers of mud and debris. The students belly crawled on throbbing knees and
[01:49:49] elbows into hip-deep mud, swamps and surf as the explosions chased them from cover and foxholes.
[01:49:56] Until Kaufman's regime, no navy unit had been subjected to training course whose
[01:50:02] essence so closely resembled that of real war. The frantic harassment, the inescapable cold,
[01:50:08] the relentless exhaustion, not only did it prepare for what was to come, it set them apart from
[01:50:14] everyone else in the navy. Even in the early classes, as many as half the men who started did not
[01:50:21] complete the week. That was entirely the point, modeling his project on the culture of the core
[01:50:28] frunk, Kaufman had set out to forge both in a spree decor and the reputation that always accompanies
[01:50:34] it. Exclusivity. If you haven't been through it, he would later say, you're not a demolition
[01:50:40] year. In August 1943, Kaufman volunteered for his own program. At 32 years old, with eyesight
[01:50:49] not good enough to qualify for his own demolition standards, he was hardly an ideal candidate.
[01:50:55] I think I have never seen a man struggle so desperately, Warlock said after witnessing Kaufman's
[01:51:02] performance. The moment he finished his 10-mile beach run, he passed out. During the ocean swim,
[01:51:08] Warlock thought he would drown. We all knew he wasn't a great athlete said,
[01:51:12] Frank Kane, and we thought, hell, if he can make it, we can too. Throughout the training,
[01:51:18] Kaufman listed, but never sank, alternately encouraging and bullying his boat crew from start to finish.
[01:51:24] As one remembered with his bloody battle cry of core frunk, when men showed signs of cracking
[01:51:31] during another bone-trolling dip in the ocean, Kaufman turned it into a joke, annoyingly repeating
[01:51:36] the same mocking phrase. The water he boomed in his strong, mid-Atlantic accent is never cold.
[01:51:43] The Monday after Kaufman completed this week, he was ordered to report to captain at
[01:51:48] clearance, goldbrunson, the base commander of Fort Pierce, swole in from head to foot,
[01:51:54] with fingers like sausages ready to burst, he crawled out of bed and staggered into the
[01:51:59] commander's office. What's this I hear about 40% of your classes either being in the sick bay
[01:52:05] or quitting the captain bark? I don't think you have any idea what you're putting these men through
[01:52:10] draper. I do Kaufman responded, it was hell. When Kaufman's trainees completed hell week, the name,
[01:52:19] his week of misery inevitably took on, their demolitions training program progressed to its
[01:52:25] next phase, two weeks of explosives, two week of reconnaissance, and three weeks of practical exercises.
[01:52:31] So there you go, freaking hell week. Yeah, created by, I mean we look around them and how many
[01:52:44] team guys do you know that would fit his bill today? I mean we kind of think that we sort of
[01:52:50] created ourselves. I mean we have a lot of people that sort of came together to create this
[01:52:57] program and they're not, they don't look like us. I mean they were sailors, ship fleet sailors.
[01:53:03] I mean they put this thing together and somebody who's you know the most unlikely person,
[01:53:10] draper Kaufman is not what you would think of as a modern day sealer, modern day frogman. In fact
[01:53:15] you don't want to be, he just I mean he's he sort of continues to do the thing that he doesn't
[01:53:21] really want to do because that's the right thing that he you know it's the thing that's going to
[01:53:27] accomplish the mission that he's been given which is to demolish Hitler's Atlantic wall. He doesn't
[01:53:31] know how else to do it. So you know he squeezes every drop of his biography into this curriculum.
[01:53:41] Fast forward a little bit, actually fast forward a pretty good chunk going into D-Day.
[01:53:45] And again you're your detail and the the research that you did to get here is just it's unbelievable
[01:53:53] the read. With terrified soldiers frozen in place neither advancing or retreating,
[01:53:57] Freeman and Kaley, Kaley sprinted between post yelling of senators and kicking the
[01:54:02] infantry men away. Once clear Freeman gave the signal, tossed a purple smoke grenade and
[01:54:07] petty officer bass pulled the fuse fire in the hole at 655 only 22 minutes after landing the whole
[01:54:14] area exploded and a roar that drowned out the battles did. Shooting skyward a mixture of water,
[01:54:20] smoke, wood, sand and steel high into the air. The defenders response was vicious as soon as the
[01:54:26] smoke and debris settled the fire from the hills became unbearable. As mingled off the
[01:54:31] Georgian with a hole in his leg crawled hand over hand to the sea wall and safety around slam
[01:54:37] through his helmet into his forehead killing him instantly. With the obstacles blown in the beach
[01:54:42] cover gone petty officer bass a former CB from Durham North Carolina resisted the urge to run and
[01:54:48] instead found Seaman Farrell alone. Still writhing from the hole in his knee and with a fresh
[01:54:53] room wound to his right eye. Bass bent down to cradle the boy to cover him and as he did a bullet
[01:54:59] tore through his back and ring just to the right of his spine and blowing a hole out as right
[01:55:03] shoulder. Sergeant Murphy one of the army's naval augmenties found them both and dragged him to the
[01:55:08] sea wall. Wounded himself and with nearly everyone in his crew either shot or dead,
[01:55:14] Freeman was unstoppable blasting obstacles clearing out infantry men before his charges blue,
[01:55:19] helping his wounded to cover. Though they had been cut to shreds, gapless old team one had completed
[01:55:25] his mission. Their 50 yard gap was clear and that's just one little chunk of the detail that you
[01:55:36] give on all these heroic acts that are going on by fast forward by morning, by morning's
[01:55:41] ed with the help of Hall's destroyers that gapless old teams had partially cleared five of their
[01:55:45] 16 target sections along Omaha Beach by nightfall the total was 10. For the NCD use and
[01:55:51] accomplishment that came at a cost prematurely estimated two dozen dead at least that many wounded
[01:55:57] and 15 more missing. These lastity there been blown clear of their landing vessels and drowned
[01:56:02] or in the words of one writer had run off to fight with the army. In fact some had done just that
[01:56:08] or at least abandoned their section of beach. As a handful of planners that expected,
[01:56:18] the most difficult aspect of Rommel's Atlantic wall had been the beach and the underwater
[01:56:23] obstacles a problem that had been overcome only because of the Navy's commitment. First in
[01:56:28] identifying the issue, necks and commissioning, coughment assault that then in sharing those
[01:56:33] lessons with the army's combat engineers. Ultimately however the Navy's greatest contribution
[01:56:38] had come from the NCD use themselves. In addition to the presidential unit citation Admiral Hall
[01:56:44] had gone on to recognize the demolition years by recommending them a trunk full of individual awards
[01:56:51] individual awards including six Navy crosses, one of which went to chief pedi officer Bill Freeman.
[01:56:57] I kicked myself ever since that I didn't recommend him for a metal varnish hall said later.
[01:57:02] I never heard of anybody who did a greater job than that fellow did.
[01:57:07] Responsible for getting the army passed the underwater obstacles on Omaha Beach,
[01:57:11] the NCD use achievement was in the end made possible only by their training at Fort Pierce.
[01:57:17] There they had learned not only the technical skills of underwater demolition,
[01:57:21] the explosives, the pull fuses, the minimum safe distances, but also as Kaufman had insisted
[01:57:26] the ability to push past the limits of normal human endurance to withstand cold, hunger,
[01:57:32] raw skin, exhaustion even the chaos of combat, the kind of fortitude that made winning wars possible.
[01:57:38] Only our vigorous training held us together once survivors said afterward,
[01:57:42] but what about what about after that? With the collapse of the Atlantic wall, the mission of the
[01:57:48] NCD use had been accomplished and therefore no unit in the U.S. military was in greater threat
[01:57:54] of disbandement or at least would have been had not been for one final hang up.
[01:57:59] The Navy's planners were low to disband a unit that had just performed so effectively.
[01:58:04] After all, the war was far from over and there was no shortage of needs for sailors so
[01:58:10] conditioned to the combat that lay ahead.
[01:58:15] Boom. Yeah, it's, I mean, I don't know about you, but nobody ever connected
[01:58:20] a hell-week or the reason for hell-week to Omaha Beach, but I don't think that we would have
[01:58:27] that crucible today if it wasn't for that, it justified everything that Kaufman did.
[01:58:37] I mean, we later in the war, you see lots of people get pulled over to the U.D.T.
[01:58:44] whether they're C.B.'s or Marines or even soldiers in some instances. And those, you know,
[01:58:52] they don't necessarily go through hell-week. If it had not been for that experience,
[01:58:56] it's likely that we would not have this, that crucible. And without that crucible,
[01:59:03] what would the seal teams be? They'd be another command of force, but would they be
[01:59:08] everything that we are today? I mean, that's the defining moment of training.
[01:59:12] All right. I mean, yeah. Well, you called it the Sacramento Cup.
[01:59:16] Yeah. It is the Sacramento. I mean, we all have these, I mean,
[01:59:22] there's institutions all around us with institutions with the U.S. Constitution, or
[01:59:26] there, whatever, your Catholicism. I mean, that your faith has these little institutions built into it.
[01:59:33] And, you know, if you're going to take the canochism, there's all these sacraments that you've got to do.
[01:59:38] And what's more, what's a bigger sacrament, and, you know, the becoming of the seal, then,
[01:59:46] that hell-week? Yeah. Not one. You get into next, Tarawa.
[01:59:55] And what happens at Tarawa, which is a total nightmare. I don't know if you had the chance,
[02:00:00] we had a guy, Dean Ladd, that was on this podcast, and he was a Marine Corps.
[02:00:06] Wow. I think he was a, I think it was a first lieutenant by that time.
[02:00:11] That did a bunch of islands, including Tarawa. Got gut shot, Tarawa 800 yards from the beach.
[02:00:17] Two Marines, disobeyed orders to leave him and move forward and drag him back to a boat.
[02:00:21] He survived and ended up going back. But yeah, you detail what happened there, how bad it was.
[02:00:29] And basically, if you don't know anyone that doesn't know the Marine Corps hit reefs on the way in.
[02:00:36] And the boats got hung up, and so the guys had to get out and walk with no protection whatsoever
[02:00:43] through the ocean. 800, it was around 800 yards to get to the beach where there was,
[02:00:50] once they got to the beach, it was hell as well. So, and we've always known that Tarawa is the moment
[02:00:56] that, you know, the need for UDTs is identified. We don't exactly know the reason, though.
[02:01:01] I mean, because the Marine Corps, they come up with the solution or what they perceive to be the solution
[02:01:07] before the Tarawa battle even commences. And that, like I described, is the landing vehicle
[02:01:12] tractor, the LBT. It's a technical problem. They have a technical solution for it.
[02:01:18] The problem with that is Turner doesn't like their solution. Kelly Turner sees the cancer, or it
[02:01:25] sees the coral as a cancer. It's going to complicate everything as far as all the rest of the
[02:01:32] campaigns ahead of him. He doesn't want to deal with us. He wants that coral out so he can get his
[02:01:38] Higgins boats to the beach. And the only way to do that is to find him.
[02:01:41] Yeah, and what's interesting, too, is after Tarawa, the Marine Corps solution was,
[02:01:49] you know, like you said, it was just more. Yeah, more. Yeah, just okay. So, we're going to lose
[02:01:53] X percentage of boats on the way and cool. More. We're going to lose this many LTVs on the way and
[02:01:58] cool. More. Bring us more. That was their answer. And Turner was saying, hey, actually not a good
[02:02:03] answer. Well, let's figure out how to solve this problem. Yeah, Churchill's quote, you know, we've
[02:02:07] run out of money now. It's time to think. I mean, you could just say, you know, just as much
[02:02:13] when it comes to logistics. There, I mean, there's nothing that compares with the US military
[02:02:18] logistics and manufacturing might going into this. But we still have limits. You can't, these
[02:02:24] LVTs, they take up a ton of space on all the ships that the Navy's going to use to transport
[02:02:28] them. The Higgins boats, they're easier to carry, they're faster in the water. You can time
[02:02:34] everything from Naval Gunfare to aircraft coming into the support of the landings if you have a
[02:02:40] faster vehicle to get them from the ships to the shores. And that's what Turner wants. He wants to
[02:02:45] be able to get his ships as quickly to the beach as possible. It's the safest way. It's the easiest
[02:02:51] to get everything there. And the only way to do that is to find the coral to get rid of it.
[02:02:57] We start training now, but under Turner's direction, we start training. We're training Hawaii now.
[02:03:03] In May, a fresh batch of NCDU recruits arrived in Maui, per the direction of Colour and Kaufman,
[02:03:09] the men were told to abandon the bulk of their gear. Their green fatigues, their boots,
[02:03:13] their May-West life jackets, even their helmets and sidearms, and slip into a pair of black Maui
[02:03:18] swim trunks and dive masks. Their rough rubber edges sanded down to prevent them from biting into
[02:03:24] their face. What followed were nine seemingly endless days of training on how to systematically
[02:03:29] map an underwater landscape and blow it up. Rocks, coral, night swimming blast, no rest, no sleep,
[02:03:35] suicide stuff, one trainee remembered. For no fewer than six hours a day, recruits lived in the
[02:03:42] water, perfecting their strokes until they could swim a mile before breakfast. Their only day off
[02:03:46] was Monday, when possible. Seeing that this was the first time many of them in handled explosive
[02:03:51] fused or tied, primer cord into a trunk line, accidents were routine. Fingers blown clear off
[02:03:56] or hanging by bloody shreds of skin. Asked how long he could swim underwater with a hundred
[02:04:01] pounds of powder, recruit, canoric, replied, with a hundred pounds of powder, I could probably
[02:04:07] stay under forever. So this is, I highlighted that port because this is a point now where we're
[02:04:13] starting to see the idea of the naked warrior, they're getting rid of all their dear, they're just
[02:04:17] wearing trunks. Sipan is where we get this recon, like a legit recon going on. The closer his
[02:04:29] swimmer's got to the beach, the more nervous Kaufman became. At a hundred yards, he tried to
[02:04:32] turn them around, but most of them kept going at 50 yards, some began to pivot back, but some didn't.
[02:04:37] Closing to within 30 yards of the shore and 40 yards of the guns, so close that they
[02:04:42] ceased swimming and dug their toes of their sneakers into the sand, pulling themselves along
[02:04:47] with their gloves hands. When that last line finally did run out of water, each man backed off
[02:04:52] slightly turned left, then side stroked along the beach for 25 yards, edging his mask out of the
[02:04:57] water with every breath, breath careful to remember the locations of any gun positions under
[02:05:02] circumstances, not an easy thing to forget. On the swim back, each man ignored his exhaustion
[02:05:08] and worsening leg cramps and stayed as close as possible to the bottom. When they near the
[02:05:14] reef Kaufman reborn, it is mattress and offered a nearby swimmer a toe, get that damn thing
[02:05:19] out of here. This is, you go over this earlier, all the little rafts that they have were getting shot
[02:05:23] up. On the other side of the now surf slammed reef, each swimmer waited for pickup. When the landing
[02:05:28] craft arrived, the coxants took turns motoring each man and either drop. Drop them a Jacobs
[02:05:34] ladder or reverse the engines until he could grab hold and pull himself up. Throughout this
[02:05:39] cumbersome boarding a period packed with versiferous cursing, his head one survivor every man
[02:05:45] aboard fully expected a mortar round to drop square into the boat. As soon as the last man
[02:05:49] was loaded, Kaufman tallied his numbers and realized that in addition to the officer killed
[02:05:54] on the air mattress, two of his swimmers were still missing. Pulled in separate directions by
[02:05:58] his instinct to rescue it and his orders to rush back to the fleet, Kaufman looked around at his
[02:06:03] blue tinge to black stripe men and chose the more painful option with the fleet waiting for his
[02:06:08] information. Kaufman ordered his boats back to the APDs. When the men of UDT7 arrived back at the
[02:06:14] Humphries, they discovered something remarkable. Though several men had been wounded,
[02:06:19] some with serious internal injuries from the mortar blasts, not a single one of their swimmers had
[02:06:24] been lost. In fact, the only men that had been killed had been the ones who had remained on the
[02:06:29] LCPRs as they had waited for swimmers to return. Kaufman's UDT5 swimmers had been slightly
[02:06:34] left less fortunate with one killed several more wounded and two still missing, but it was
[02:06:39] nothing compared to the bloodbath that occurred just one week before it normally.
[02:06:42] So this is another methodology of execute these things. And it's sort of a metaphor for
[02:06:50] what actually happened, the entire history. So the Navy intentionally creates all of these units.
[02:06:59] They create NCDUs, they create UDT, they create the scouts and raiders. All of these units are
[02:07:04] created for a specific purpose, they're committed to action for a specific reason. But once the
[02:07:11] Navy creates these things, the Navy can't necessarily predict how far the individuals that are
[02:07:16] the belong to these institutions are going to push them. They're going to push those envelopes.
[02:07:20] So Kaufman, when he's driving his men toward the beach or he's pushing his men to swim,
[02:07:25] he also is trying to stop them. He's trying to stop them 50 yards from a shore they won't
[02:07:29] they keep going 25 yards. So the seal teams are created by the Navy, they're created by the Navy
[02:07:36] for the Navy. But you can sort of see it just in that moment. The seal teams become so much more
[02:07:44] because of the seals themselves. So the seals don't create it. We don't. We're not responsible for
[02:07:49] our own institutions. We think we are, but we're not. But we are responsible for what that
[02:07:53] institutional ultimately became. Yeah, you know, there's an interesting time that you make in the
[02:07:57] book. And I don't remember, it's in my nose to Carl Rho's. I'll just mention it now. The Navy, the Navy,
[02:08:06] just by nature of being disaggregated and being spread apart, especially back in the day,
[02:08:11] there was decentralized command unlike really unlike any other organization. Absolutely. And that
[02:08:18] that spirit of decentralized command of like, hey, you go and you take the fight to the enemy.
[02:08:23] You get in this ship or you get in this submarine, you go overseas and you take the fight to the
[02:08:28] enemy. That's you have mission type orders. Right. And that's that's the way the Navy had
[02:08:33] had to exist back in the day and that vein and that DNA remains. And that's why you get these
[02:08:41] guys that are very proactive and will will be default aggressive out there on the battlefield.
[02:08:47] That's exactly right. Default aggressive. Latitude only works if your default orientation or
[02:08:56] default setting is aggression. And if you read any like naval history book during like
[02:09:03] the Napoleonic Wars or if you read the Patrick O'Brien Master in Commander series,
[02:09:08] like you're never, you know, connect to your channel command. Whereas the army always is.
[02:09:14] So that, you know, as technology has improved or as technology's gotten better to connect
[02:09:20] commanders to their troops in the field, that chain of command has only thickened. Whereas in the
[02:09:25] Navy, I mean, we have all of the history behind us or the Navy has all of the history behind it
[02:09:30] of latitude, of mission type orders, of relying on the aggressiveness of the individual commander.
[02:09:36] You just have to trust your guys. But you have to be specific about what you want. Oh, for sure.
[02:09:42] So otherwise you get rogue. Exactly. You do talk about what the UDT's brought back from that.
[02:09:48] And what they brought back was good information. Good intel that they could then form into a
[02:09:53] make a better battle plan. The invasion of sidepan goes smoother. Fast forward a little bit by the
[02:09:58] fall of 1944. The Navy's underwater demolition teams were the most indispensable of all
[02:10:03] US military's special operations units. A facet directly attributed to the Central Pacific
[02:10:08] planners who would no longer go anywhere without their reconnaissance reports.
[02:10:14] The UDT's were an essential part of amphibious organization for the remainder of the war
[02:10:18] wrote Turner on the last day of combat on Tinian. It is questionable if we could have made our
[02:10:24] landing except after the great losses, except after great losses if we had not had these teams
[02:10:30] to prepare the way. This assessment was immediately echoed by Admiral Connelly who concluded his
[02:10:35] invasion in Guam by declaring that without UDT's discovery and demolition of some 640 obstacles
[02:10:42] along 3,000 yards of beaches, including the nearly car-sized coconut log cribs filled with loose
[02:10:47] coral. The landings quote, would could not have been made. There in spite of orders for bidding
[02:10:54] them to do so, three demolition swimmers, including Gunners' first mate. Gunners first mate,
[02:11:01] Gunners' mate first class, Henry L. Green had grown so convinced of the UDT's worth
[02:11:07] that they had planted a white butcher block-sized sign at the water's edge with the following
[02:11:13] message, US Marine, welcome to the USO, greetings from UDT4. During this, Admiral Connelly had
[02:11:20] summoned the team's commander to a state room in order to hand him a starch counseling.
[02:11:23] But instead, had neutralized his own admonitions by stopping the young officer at the door
[02:11:31] declaring, wait till I tell Turner, he'll have those Marine generals eating crow.
[02:11:41] It's so childish. It's so childish, but that's what it is. How many times have you in your service
[02:11:47] interacted with a sister service? The rivalry exists. It's a brotherhood on the battlefield,
[02:11:56] but still we're always chasing our institutional prologue, or trying to push the boundaries
[02:12:02] of our institutional authority. What's interesting is when you get into the senior ranks,
[02:12:10] there becomes a real tension between the services and the amount of money that they get.
[02:12:19] It becomes a real thing. You say here to recognize their contribution, we're taking of the
[02:12:27] Mariana's Turner showered the UDTs with awards, more than 60 silver stars, 300 bronze stars,
[02:12:33] reported the largest mass recommendation for sailors and Marines in the war up to that point.
[02:12:37] Given the importance of the job, Connley would have pinned Navy crosses on the commanding officers
[02:12:42] of UDT-3 and 4, but ended in the end, settle for silver stars, each of them presented by none other
[02:12:47] than Admiral Kaufman, Draper's father. As for Draper himself, rumors circulated about his
[02:12:53] nomination for the Medal of Honor, an accolade his father, chairman of the awards board in the
[02:12:57] Pacific, lobbied against for fear of the medals association with recklessness. In the end, Draper
[02:13:03] received a Navy cross, his second pinned on by his father with a comment that allowed the photographer
[02:13:08] to catch the serious young man in a laugh. Thank the Lord, you found a clean short.
[02:13:17] Yeah, that's a relationship I could have spent a lot more time on. I mean, he's, you know,
[02:13:22] Draper's dad is out there, you know, in the fleet. He's a Commodore himself and, you know,
[02:13:28] he knows exactly the risks that his son is taking and he does nothing. During the entire war,
[02:13:35] to either convince Turner, you know, to have the UDT take last risk. He just, he's as,
[02:13:45] you know, I don't know as a father and I know your father too. Like, I don't know that I'd be able
[02:13:51] to to keep myself disciplined enough to not interfere.
[02:13:55] Get him orders to the Washington DC admin spot.
[02:14:02] Yeah, I just don't know how. Whatever that impulse, you know, with those guys had,
[02:14:06] I don't know that it's, it exists today. But either that you make a freaking boat
[02:14:11] crew leader in UDT for just break it ready to get some. This is just, you jump into this next
[02:14:18] part chapter six, the contest for the guerilla war in China and the organization that had no
[02:14:24] damn business fighting in it. The US Navy's Army of sailors. This is just freaking buckwild. This
[02:14:30] whole section. I mean, you get this guy born Milton, he Roberts in 1900 in Jerome Arizona,
[02:14:36] Miles spent his first years in a mountainside mining hub called by the New York sun in 1903,
[02:14:43] the wickedest town in the West. He was only a child. He was the only child of a lumber cutter was
[02:14:48] nearly 30 years older than his mother. Before Miles was even eight as father was dead, which was
[02:14:52] something of a blessing as it had given his mother an opportunity to move and remarry then in Seattle,
[02:14:58] a stepfather. Miles had received, from his stepfather, Miles had received the last name he would live with,
[02:15:03] but not much else at 14 miles ran away from home. You just set up this background with this guy.
[02:15:09] He glistened the Navy. He ends up taking some tests to get into the in Ireland to get into the
[02:15:15] Naval Academy. He gets in, goes to the Naval Academy. He gets to play to China for a five-year tour.
[02:15:24] Ends up, you know, doing operations in the Yangzi River. This is the warlord period. He learns
[02:15:32] about leadership diplomacy, geography, small boat handling, how to shoot his way out of a hold-up.
[02:15:37] Unlike most Westerners, picks up various coastal dialects. So this dude's speaking freaking
[02:15:43] Chinese or Mandarin or whatever. He's brilliant. I mean, there's nobody. I mean, like I said,
[02:15:50] I mean, we got our history, not just from, you know, frog men. We got it from, you know, just
[02:15:55] fleet sailors. And this is, I mean, military movie sand pebbles. Yeah.
[02:16:01] This is sand pebbles. Yeah, this is sand. So sand bubbles go watch it if you haven't seen it.
[02:16:05] I know you haven't seen it. I call it Charles because it's a classic. It's an actual good movie.
[02:16:09] There's no, there's not many like CGI explosions in it. But yeah, this is sand pebbles all day.
[02:16:15] We had the movie sand pebbles on one of my arc deployments is back before internet or anything.
[02:16:20] So we just had video tapes. We would watch sand pebbles over and over again.
[02:16:25] And that's what this guy is doing. He's, so he ends up running these freaking guerrillas in China,
[02:16:32] which is nuts. He's, I mean, nobody knows about him today.
[02:16:37] Like he's completely forgotten to history. But I mean, he's every bit is consequential,
[02:16:42] at least as far as the Navy's journey from, you know, the ocean to the land,
[02:16:49] as, you know, say somebody like Lawrence of Arabia. He doesn't have the style of somebody like
[02:16:53] that, which is probably, you know, part of the reason that he's forgotten. And, you know, his book
[02:16:58] a different kind of war is, you know, it's not, you know, some pillars was. But, you know,
[02:17:04] he wrote that thing when he had been diagnosed with, with prostate cancer. So he was racing against
[02:17:10] the clock to, to try and get this recorded. And he was, you know, he knew he only had maybe a year
[02:17:16] to live. And he's, you know, drafting this thing. He's typing up little sections of it.
[02:17:20] His wife is, is, is cutting these sections out to reorder them and he's pushing,
[02:17:25] she's putting these things together with Scotch tape. I actually found that record in the,
[02:17:30] the national archives. It still exists. So he talks about, his wife wrote the forward to the book
[02:17:38] to say, you know, how this was done, how it was cut, retaped together and everything like that.
[02:17:42] And then to see that, to find that in the national archives, the whole, you know, these retaped
[02:17:47] together pages, it's pretty incredible. But, you know, like I said, this guy, he is the Navy's version
[02:17:54] of Lawrence, I'm a Arabia. He's the, it's freaking crazy. Yeah, insane. And he's a flag officer.
[02:18:01] Yeah. And he's involving himself the entire war in these little mini skirmishes and ambushes.
[02:18:05] I mean, he's, I mean, he's almost killed three times just by assassins. Yeah, it's nuts.
[02:18:10] It's a freaking crazy story. And he loses mind in the process. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:18:14] All, you say there's along with his promotion, Admiral King elevated,
[02:18:18] it's, uh, Saco, which is the Cino American Cooperation Organization. This is this group that they got
[02:18:23] running all over China to Naval Group China and act that likewise elevated each camp to a formal,
[02:18:28] and they got all these camps. They got all these camps that have been running this network of camps.
[02:18:34] Uh, uh, an act that likewise elevated each camp to a formal naval unit and invested miles
[02:18:40] with the authority of a group commander, increasing his roles to 600 officers and 2, 2,
[02:18:44] 2,400 enlisted men about 300 more than a lot of to a World War 2 battleship and a commitment by the
[02:18:50] Navy that was further augmented by various numbers of Marines, Coast Guard's men radio operators.
[02:18:55] To supply all these men, miles receive two planes. Their engines rarely idle to which ferry
[02:19:01] loads from Chongqing to the various camps. The gas alone for these planes gobbled up as much as
[02:19:06] half of miles monthly tonnage allotmen over the hump, but for the first time in the war,
[02:19:10] Sacco camps began receiving at least a portion of what they deserved. So this guy is running a
[02:19:16] freaking crazy guerrilla war. He's running an army. He's a, he's a naval commander who's running an army
[02:19:21] like, uh, like we talked about earlier. He's running, he has no communication with these units
[02:19:26] for the most part. So he's, he's, he's getting these commanders mostly Marines, uh, that are,
[02:19:31] that are coming to him. He's giving them a spine of sailors to go work with and then this
[02:19:35] Marine commander and these navy sailors are trucking sometimes three months at a time to get to their
[02:19:39] station in China. They set up a camp, they start training Chinese guerrillas and then they commit them
[02:19:44] to action. Um, and because he has no communication with them, he has to rely on the aggressiveness of
[02:19:51] each of these leaders. In some cases, it works out. Some cases, it doesn't. So really, all he's doing at
[02:19:56] this point is just managing his talent pool and assessing whether or not they're sending back,
[02:20:02] you know, aggressive enough reports about the operations that they're undertaking. Uh, anyway.
[02:20:08] Yeah, you, you cover it. I mean, it's just, it's an incredible story again.
[02:20:14] Then probably some books and it's over 10 books. Like, and the thing that like was, uh, I was
[02:20:19] blown away with, and I focused my, uh, attention of this chapter on Camp Six because Camp Six
[02:20:25] is really the only unit, uh, in Soko that is run by, uh, a member of naval special warfare.
[02:20:32] Every, every other camp, uh, except in rare instances is run by a Marine. So the, the legacy of
[02:20:39] those camps is, you know, uh, you know, understandably, you know, a feather in the Marine course cap.
[02:20:44] They should be, uh, nothing but, you know, impressed with the legacy of the, the the Marine Corps
[02:20:49] led units. But, uh, Admiral King towards the, uh, towards the tail end of this period, you know,
[02:20:56] they're running out of Marines descent. And not only that, but the Scouts and Raider program is going away.
[02:21:00] And, well, King doesn't want to go away. He wants to send, uh, you know, sort of quasi-marine sailors
[02:21:08] to backfill, uh, the Marine commitment to Soko. So he repurposes, uh, the Scouts and Raider school
[02:21:14] turns it into the amphibious Raider school and is trying to get as many, uh, marine type sailors
[02:21:20] into Soko as possible, uh, to justify this course. So we don't have to get rid of this course after,
[02:21:25] uh, the end of World War II. Uh, and Camp Six, uh, becomes sort of the repository of
[02:21:30] all of that experience. Buck Houtburn, who you mentioned at the beginning of the book, the, uh, the
[02:21:34] Jewish, uh, Notre Dame quarterback. He gets sent there, uh, Buck, uh, a, a Phil Bucklou, uh, comes,
[02:21:41] comes West and starts, uh, leading reconnaissance, uh, and rating operations. Uh, uh,
[02:21:46] but yeah, Camp Six is the, um, Camp Six is the first, uh, instance of naval special warfare
[02:21:55] really going ashore. And they do everything. They do raids, they do ship attacks,
[02:22:00] uh, by the end of the war. Helpern is literally leading from the saddle, uh, on a horse, uh, and pushing
[02:22:08] his gorillas into action. That's incredible. Yeah. It's, it's freaking, it's just a great story. And again,
[02:22:14] it, it, it, you know, um, I've often said that, you know, when I got the teams, I don't know,
[02:22:22] when you got this still, so it was, there was no doctrine when you got the teams. There was
[02:22:25] no doctrine when I got the teams. You couldn't, if you wanted to know how to do, uh,
[02:22:29] uh, an assault on a target, you, you couldn't look it up. Someone had to tell you,
[02:22:34] your platoon chief, or your LPO was going to teach you how to do it. It wasn't written down anywhere.
[02:22:38] Whereas the army and the Marine Corps, but you can look at exactly how to do a target assault.
[02:22:42] It tells you step by step what to do. So we don't have any doctrine. We have more now,
[02:22:47] but that's one of, uh, one of our biggest weaknesses is that we don't have any doctrine.
[02:22:52] One of our biggest strengths is that we don't have any doctrine. And, and that's why you get a
[02:22:56] freaking guy that's like, oh, what are we going to do? We're going to, we're going to, of course, back
[02:23:00] raids. That's what's happening. Cool. Let's figure out how to do it. And, and again, that decentralized
[02:23:05] command, the default aggressive attitude, that's, that's in, that's got to be in, that's the DNA of the
[02:23:10] seal teams. And it's rooted back to Camp 6. Camp 6. I don't like it. Fast forward. The end of the
[02:23:21] war should have been the happiest day of my life, wrote Miles afterward, tasked with an impossible
[02:23:25] mission, yoke to impossible partners. He had never the less achieved something greater than
[02:23:29] ever been asked of him. A navy run gorilla army and intelligence infrastructure that had
[02:23:34] stretched from Indochina to the Goby desert. Assisted by Marines, his sailors had trained as many
[02:23:40] as a hundred thousand Chinese gorillas. Rest you'd airmen and mission missionaries, blasted open
[02:23:45] Japanese tanks, blown up some 158 bridges, derailed some 66 Japanese trains, sunk 35 Japanese ships,
[02:23:54] raided uncountable Japanese camps, and led at least one cavalry charge on camels. Best estimates
[02:24:03] at the time placed a number of sacco and flickeded casualties at around 26,717 killed,
[02:24:10] 8,720 wounded, 646 captured. Of the roughly 2500 Americans who served in psycho,
[02:24:17] five were killed. That's amazing. That's amazing. And this doesn't even
[02:24:21] can consider the strategic impact of psycho because they're tying down a million Japanese troops.
[02:24:27] The entire time. Yeah. Troops that could be fighting on all those islands.
[02:24:31] Right. For sure. For sure. But they can't. A million. I mean, there's, you know, when you
[02:24:36] think of there's 30 or 40,000 Japanese on these islands, when most of these islands somewhere around
[02:24:40] that number, you know, if you have an extra million soldiers to throw into that mix,
[02:24:45] as was true of every successful general in history, Miles success had come at the price of his
[02:24:49] sleep, his health, his family's happiness, and even his sanity. For his sacrifices, he had been
[02:24:55] keep not with praise and press releases, but with troubles bureaucracy and overwaining scrutiny.
[02:25:01] In the end, psycho, along with the Navy's guerrilla warfare effort, received a reward as glamorous
[02:25:09] as an obituary. As Miles bitterly concluded, the month that followed the surrender of Japan was the
[02:25:15] worst through which I lived. After hosting a dinner for many of his psycho officers, this is
[02:25:26] after the war. Miles began rambling, seemingly endless lecture on what the atomic bomb would mean
[02:25:32] for the US Navy's future, as men awkwardly drifted out of the room. Miles continued on
[02:25:36] aware when every man had left, and when the lights had been turned off, after the camp,
[02:25:41] Dr. Confind him to a state room, Miles jumped from the window and took off sprinting through a
[02:25:45] rice patty, chased by a group of American advisors and Chinese guerrillas. He escaped, passed
[02:25:50] them all, and stole a Jeep. As he rattled past his pursuers, he was heard muttering over and over.
[02:25:56] I must get to the drill field. Blocked the road, God damn it, that's an order. He shouted,
[02:26:01] shouted at the camps, Dr. to the driver of a six by six truck. When the Jeep reached the
[02:26:05] road, block Miles jumped out and ordered the truck driver to move. The doctor counterman at the
[02:26:09] order and told Miles to return to his quarters where upon Miles accused everyone of lying to him.
[02:26:14] You're on the sick list. The doctor finally managed. What are you saying, Dr. I'm all right.
[02:26:19] I don't think you are Admiral. The doctor replied nervously and have to officially inform you
[02:26:24] that you are on the sick list and have been relieved of your command. As the words drilled into
[02:26:29] Miles' delusion, the doctor could feel him shaking like a leaf. Finally, Miles relented I.I.
[02:26:34] Dr. He out back into the Jeep or turn to his quarters. Next morning, his place under house arrest
[02:26:41] and his razor compensated in Washington, Metzall, Metzall, Misses Billy Miles, and informed her
[02:26:48] that her husband had a complete mental breakdown and that they could only hope he had not suffered
[02:26:53] permanent brain damage.
[02:26:54] The broken, I mean, he literally left everything in China. When he comes back, it takes months
[02:27:08] and months before he regains the sanity. But this whole theater of warfare was, I mean, mad.
[02:27:18] And it's just dealing with the Chinese on a daily basis. There are so many other people who tried
[02:27:28] Joe Stilwell tries to deal with China. I mean, he's frustrated. His entire war. He leaves
[02:27:33] not in disgrace but at least in massive frustration. Weedermire has the same headaches with the
[02:27:40] Chinese. But what still well and we tomorrow don't have to deal with is an oppressive army scrutiny.
[02:27:48] And when the army gets there, they see China as clearly their area of operations.
[02:27:56] And it is. I mean, they can't argue with it. I mean, it's a land. I mean, just like if the army
[02:28:02] decided that they were going to seize control of the South China Sea, then maybe we would
[02:28:06] certainly have something to say about it. Well, when they get there, the navy has this infrastructure
[02:28:11] in place and they don't know what to do with it. So they try to progressively take control of
[02:28:20] miles' organization. And in the end, miles loses out. The army takes control of it. And the only
[02:28:28] thing that stops them from really seizing control is all of the trouble that miles have had,
[02:28:33] which is geography. They can't see control of this thing. Miles maintains his command over his
[02:28:38] organization for the remainder of the war. So the problem is the solution. Yeah. Yeah. That's it.
[02:28:47] I got to mention this section here. At the time of the Japanese surrender,
[02:28:51] Rudy Bosch, a 17 year old volunteer with the amphibious Rogers, looked up from the middle of the
[02:28:56] training exercise in the Swamp's near Lake Oki Chobi to hear the class instructor. Now,
[02:29:02] stop what you're doing. The war is over. Told the return to Fort Pierce, Bosch and his
[02:29:06] classmates were then given a single final order tear it down. What followed was the sacking of
[02:29:11] three years' worth of construction. Mess halls, classrooms, offices, ranges, towers before a back
[02:29:16] drop of flaming white tents, tents that at once proudly lined the roads, sheltering the
[02:29:21] nearly every that nearly every special group in the US military from the Rangers to the UDTs,
[02:29:27] the Rogers, who had not gotten a crack at China, took out their frustrations by demolishing
[02:29:32] everything with their bare hands. By the end of the week, the only thing that suggested the past
[02:29:36] experience of a naval base was the pool, last to go with the men themselves. That's it. War is over.
[02:29:45] And with the the Rogers too. Yeah, we didn't even talk. What? Give us a quick brief on the Rogers.
[02:29:51] Well, the Rogers are the sort of the natural culmination of the Scouts and Rator program. So the
[02:29:56] Scouts and Rators, the names sort of doesn't make sense. I mean, the Scouts and Rators seem like they
[02:30:05] would be a reconnaissance troops and commandos. They really weren't. Scouts and Rators are a joint unit
[02:30:10] created at the very beginning of the war. It's an Army Navy unit. The idea is we need Army,
[02:30:17] Scout, Boat, Officers to take Army Beach marking troops ashore. So the Army can signal the landing
[02:30:26] fleet signal the landing craft so troops can get into the right beaches. This is what they do in
[02:30:30] North Africa. The problem is after North Africa, the Army start to lose interest in this. And
[02:30:36] there's they they stop creating their portion of the Scouts and Rators because they have
[02:30:42] they have enough beach marking troops for the remainder of the war. So they basically leave the
[02:30:47] the entire schoolhouse and the hands of the Navy, which you know now the Navy has all this
[02:30:52] curriculum and they have no prohibition on what the Navy's portion of the Scouts and Rator program can
[02:30:56] do. So naturally the Navy starts you know taking not just the the transportation side of the mission
[02:31:02] but they take the the entire beach marking side of the mission. So they have troops that are
[02:31:08] quasi you know commandos that are trained to do beach marking but you know at this point the war
[02:31:15] in 1945 when Soko has been created they realize that they can use these troops not just for
[02:31:26] beach marking anymore but for straight up command operations they have the Army's curriculum they
[02:31:31] have all the experience of working with army commandos so they train their sailors and everything
[02:31:38] of the army commandos have been trained with and the plan is to send these units to China and that's
[02:31:44] the amphibious Rogers. So the Scouts and Rators naturally I have a picture I think in the book of
[02:31:51] there's a sign you know says Scouts and Rators and then underneath that the amphibious Rodgers
[02:31:55] within months there's no more Scouts and Rators sign it's the amphibious Rogers.
[02:32:01] But not not the best name yeah for a commando unit but the idea was that you know these were
[02:32:07] the Navy's pirates you know the Rodgers or the Jolly Rodgers these guys are supposed to be the
[02:32:12] swaggering you know bushwackers the the Pacific. Chapter seven the US Navy's post war
[02:32:20] plight and the sailor Rators who led her back to significance in Korea again there's just so much
[02:32:30] detail that you put into this it's absolutely fascinating to read. He ended up highlighting now
[02:32:37] we're in a fast forward to where in Korea target baker. This time the Scouts were accompanied by a
[02:32:44] boatload of Marines who upon landing established a hasty perimeter then flashed seaword
[02:32:49] the signal for all clear when the remaining boats hit the shore the marine secured a beach head
[02:32:54] then scouted inland for the tunnel entrance as they did two trains appeared and did the job for
[02:32:59] them revealing the location of the two rail tunnels to the southernmost the Scouts put to flight
[02:33:05] one century armed with nothing but a wooden rifle and a bayonet. After securing the southern tunnel
[02:33:10] the UDT swimmers slagged some 2,000 pounds of explosives 300 yards past the beach where they
[02:33:17] stacked pack after pack into the tunnel's mouth and under a bridge. A 0 305 the UDT swimmers pulled their
[02:33:24] fuses initiating a hasty six minute retreat to the beach and the boats followed by a concert of
[02:33:31] Ours through the surf at 330 noted the task force diary charges exploded 20 minutes later the
[02:33:38] men of sag climbed back into the bat into the bass which was the ship and into history as the
[02:33:44] Navy's first successful Raiders of the modern area era for joy and for many of the Navy planners
[02:33:51] it was just a start. Yeah that was a tough chapter sorry that was a tough chapter to sort of figure out
[02:33:58] what we're the center of gravity of this thing is like what because the I mean just the the number
[02:34:03] of Raider organizations that the Navy sponsors during this period they sponsor the Marine Corps
[02:34:09] UDT group which is the special operations group at the time the sag they sponsor UDT led British
[02:34:17] commandos they sponsor army Raiders they I mean everybody is trying to figure out how to you know
[02:34:25] do sort of what the Koreans were doing to the US military at that point which is bottled up in
[02:34:32] the Poo-Song perimeter it's like you know we've been watching a Poo-Song perimeter moment in Afghanistan
[02:34:38] there lack of leadership lack of planning lack of resourcing you know forces army are the
[02:34:49] US forces back into this the small pocket and they're doing everything they can to sort of not necessarily
[02:34:55] break out of it but at least you know not do nothing and the not doing nothing is trying to
[02:35:03] cut the North Koreans supply lines and and the one advantage that they have when the with the
[02:35:09] Korean Peninsula is all of these arteries all these roads because of the the spine of the the North
[02:35:14] Korean Geography is they push everything to the to the edges of the peninsula so this is the first
[02:35:20] time the Navy really sees you know this huge opportunity to start you know sponsoring raids
[02:35:25] ashore that's the first time that the UDT which is the only special operations unit that survives
[02:35:32] disbandment in World War II that's the that's the moment that they cease to be just beach marking
[02:35:38] or just reconnaissance troops and demolition troops and they start going ashore but they you know
[02:35:43] like every other instance they are going ashore not alone they're going ashore with the Marines
[02:35:49] with British commandos C.I. operatives partisans and they're slowly learning this trade.
[02:36:00] You go into a chapter eight here tells another story of the Rangers and the army resurrection of
[02:36:07] the army Rangers and the guerilla raid that failed to first all their second death just just another
[02:36:15] one of these you got a guy named John Hugh McGee these characters all of them they're freaking epic
[02:36:26] I mean what this guy did is just incredible his career you look at these guys career
[02:36:40] and some and I mean at least in John McGee's case I mean he he's a totally I mean he maybe has the
[02:36:46] worst world war to experience of anybody let me just jump into that real quick um a year later
[02:36:52] McGee was at the epicenter of history hopefully c Commanding Moro troops and the Philippines against
[02:36:56] Japanese bombers in the snake choked malaria hills around Del Monte field Del Monte Airfield
[02:37:03] at kilometer 117 of the Sair Highway becoming the only American of the 11 who fought to
[02:37:10] there to survive the war after six months of resistance on May 10th 1942 McGee swallid is
[02:37:16] pride obeyed his superior and with a humiliating blindfolded salute surrendered himself and as
[02:37:22] American and Filipino troops to an imperial Japanese officer wearing a kimono many of the Filipinos
[02:37:28] were tied to stakes shot and buried in pits the Japanese soldiers never bothering to confirm they were dead
[02:37:33] at 33 McGee's dark brown hair had already faded into an iron gray for the next 25 months
[02:37:41] McGee survived beatings trench foot dysentery malaria mosquitoes cages and slavery for nourishment
[02:37:48] he and his fellow prisoners were fed a meager died of rice and a few vegetables that occasionally
[02:37:52] included yams dog meat wafer thing candy bars and cigarettes the last two purchase with a monthly
[02:37:58] allotment of 40 pesos that the Japanese could turn into a lever to pry prisoners submission
[02:38:04] so sensitive to the men become to their hunger that when fearful of transfer they gorge themselves
[02:38:09] on every scrap they had hidden one man even devouring a litter of puppies born the same day
[02:38:16] along with his Catholic faith to which he cleaved McGee sustained his mind on a series of escape
[02:38:21] plans into the Philippine jungle even making use of a urinary track infection that kept him
[02:38:26] up at night to memorize the guide posts of the constellations to each plan was attached in obvious
[02:38:33] colorec colore obvious to him anyways once escaped he would raise and lead an army of Filipino
[02:38:41] gorillas against the Japanese for two years he plotted mentally choosing men for work details not
[02:38:47] for strength but for the knowledge and gunnerian logistics men around whom he could build the
[02:38:52] gorilla army in his mind on the night of June 12 two years one month and two days after his
[02:38:57] capture he finally got his chance while anchored off the east coast of Zambuanga peninsula
[02:39:03] on a prison transfer ship McGee pommed off his rose rebeats to a friend dropped every stitch of his
[02:39:09] ragged clothing to the deck then tiptoed over his sleeping comrades placed a naked foot on top
[02:39:14] of the railing and dove into the racing current through an initial volley of the through an
[02:39:19] initial volley of bullets and passed two other prison ships McGee drifted from miles until rescued by
[02:39:24] a native by a native in an outrigger who paddled him to land gave Matisha which McGee turned into a
[02:39:32] loincloth a sure two native boys eventually found fed and clothed and tied to undersigned sneakers
[02:39:38] to the bottom of his feet like heelless slippers then pushed and pulled his amaciated frame
[02:39:43] over jungle trails lit by nothing more than a torch as bright as a cigar tip and you go on
[02:39:48] from there but just you have to kind of realize what's happening. Where this guy came from
[02:39:54] and what he wants. Yeah he spends the entire war you know essentially just neutralized. Yeah
[02:40:02] well it's so he's in prison camp for two years when he finally escapes he wants to go run a run
[02:40:07] up freaking an army a gorilla army well there's other people that already been running a gorilla
[02:40:12] army and they and now they outrank him they have the experience it's so he kind of gets sideline all
[02:40:17] time is wars just a series of disciplines. Yeah so he and and when he gets back home you know to
[02:40:26] finally meets the daughter that his wife meets he meets his daughter he was never met before
[02:40:31] and his reaction is immediately to volunteer for service back in the in the Pacific theater
[02:40:38] and the day he gets back the day he takes command of his troops they drop the drop the bomb
[02:40:44] and the entire time I mean that he's been you know neutralizes entire time facing the series of
[02:40:50] disbandments his little brother has been one of Marl's Marl's Marauders most effective
[02:40:57] of Italian commanders which is a really frustrating thing. So the psychology behind that.
[02:41:04] Yeah so when he finally gets to Korea and you know he has this new opportunity to prove himself
[02:41:10] all he wants to do is create the you know the the army that he had built in his mind and he gets
[02:41:16] there and or anyway you have the there's a there's a there's a it's so they go they end up
[02:41:25] he ends up putting together kind of a group mages Rangers is that correct accurate sameman.
[02:41:30] I mean he he's the he's the indispensable person when it comes to army special operations in Korea
[02:41:38] everything sort of flows out of him. He has all these ideas at the beginning of the war and he
[02:41:43] puts them all in writing and so everything from the army Rangers are reconstituted based off
[02:41:51] of his recommendations. The partisan command is created based off of his recommendations
[02:41:57] and he wants to sort of combine these these units together. He's got this idea it's sort of
[02:42:01] unformed it's not it's not exactly what you know it's not a mature idea. It's the beginning of the
[02:42:09] war it becomes you know you you see when you when you look through the structure of the
[02:42:13] institution that he had sort of created you see like like a siege a soda of like the
[02:42:19] comes tone in certain areas there like you can see and and every time that he constitutes this thing
[02:42:25] he the navy is a critical part of his ideas you can't do any of the types of things that he wants
[02:42:30] to do unless you have significant navy support navy transports anyway so the problem is you know
[02:42:38] the the army has moved be at move past all of his ideas they you know they they entertain him
[02:42:46] they entertain these ideas for a period and as you see throughout his service the army plucks
[02:42:52] these things off the table one at a time leaving him to go back to you know the states not in
[02:42:58] disgrace but not not to fulfill the thing that he wants he got these he's got these Ranger groups
[02:43:05] together again and here's a here's a section where the Rangers are his some of his mages Rangers are
[02:43:09] going out they're on an operation I'm going to jump into the middle of this operation after a moment
[02:43:13] of intense argument Watson ordered back one of the Koreans they had left the radio Watson ordered
[02:43:18] back one of the Koreans Koreans to get the radio who not surprisingly refused until Watson threatened
[02:43:23] to beat the man himself scrambling to the clearing the Korean soldiers seize the radio by the back
[02:43:28] strap then dragged it behind him bouncing rolling smashing over rocks and leaving the trail of
[02:43:32] broken knobs handles and antenna bastards got his brains in his ass see the Watson as he watched
[02:43:38] when the runner reached the trees and present the radio everyone could see that it was destroyed
[02:43:44] with their only hope for survival buoyed upon the ability to communicate their position to the
[02:43:49] Navy's fighters and helicopters the radio's destruction meant Virginia that's the name of the team
[02:43:53] Virginia's was not far behind had Watson wanted to repay this cruelty and kind his rage was
[02:44:00] instantly short circuited by the shredding sound of a machine gun fire and the terror of communist
[02:44:06] soldiers lunging across the body strewn clearing without a word as Thornton recalled the Virginia
[02:44:12] survivors plunged into the trees and creed down the hill in a wild melee stumbling rising
[02:44:20] running and falling again hoping with every bruise to break through to the valley floor before
[02:44:24] the enemy since the news around their necks after running for what seemed like a half a mile
[02:44:29] the men collapse into the relative protection and shadow of a ravine as their lungs pump
[02:44:35] pump to miniature fog banks into the cold air their ears caught the growing but unmistakable home
[02:44:40] of hum and chop of two helicopters echoing through the valley when the first helicopter made it
[02:44:46] back to the clearing its pilot aged into a hover kicked out a bundle of supplies then leaned
[02:44:51] out as window coming face to face with a volley of muzzle flashes banking hard the pilot escaped
[02:44:57] and ambush the ambush only barely with the clearing obviously overrun both pilots roared
[02:45:03] their helicopters into an anxious racetrack search around the mountains flying so low that
[02:45:09] Thornton could easily make out each pilot's face without a radio even without even marking
[02:45:14] panels the Virginia survivors waved frantic arms but betrayed not a sound since any noise
[02:45:21] would only alert their hunters not the engine def in the pilots for 30 or so minutes the pilot
[02:45:27] searched then ascended and retrace their path through the ocean Virginia was alone
[02:45:32] except for the blowing wind and the rustle of the leafless trees remembered forten
[02:45:39] there was silence lonely empty silence they they go on the run you you highlight you
[02:45:46] you go through some of that and then finally fast forward a little bit on April 10th 10
[02:45:50] hallucinatory days since the mountain top battle and just two to three miles from U.N. lines
[02:45:55] the last remaining members of Virginia mission were cornered in a cave captured and ransacked
[02:46:02] then beaten and bound with wire so tightly that Watson's arms soon swelled to twice their normal
[02:46:07] size for the second time in his life this veteran of the Darby's Rangers was a prisoner of war
[02:46:13] as fate would have it captured while escaping from a disaster as consequential for the Rangers as
[02:46:19] Sisturnah had been and this guy Watson you you you you introduce him later and you have to get the
[02:46:27] book to see what this guy's about but let me give you a little something so this guy gets captured
[02:46:34] in the 29 months since his capture, Corporal Martin R. Watson a soldier no guard or prisoner believed
[02:46:41] was actually a corporal had set an example for captivity that to this day was has never been
[02:46:46] exceeded 30 days after he was captured for 18 of which he had been starved in a cave to make
[02:46:53] his 240 pound size somewhat easier to handle Watson and a South Korean comrade had knocked out a
[02:47:00] guard with a rock and made for the surrounding mountains where they had survived for five days
[02:47:04] until their pursuers had disabled them by rolling or grenade into their hideout. Never medically
[02:47:10] treated except with some shreds of brown paper to cover his wound wounds Watson had nevertheless
[02:47:16] escaped again this time by wriggling out of his rope restraints and jumping free of a moving
[02:47:21] truck as it slowed around a bend. This time he survived a week before inadvertently walking right past
[02:47:27] a wide-eyed North Korean patrol. For these attempts and one other plus an attempt that suicide
[02:47:33] with a piece of broken glass he had been relentlessly beaten with rifle butts and boot heels
[02:47:38] and periodically starved and always almost always isolated once in an unsheltered hole for 72 days
[02:47:46] with rations described by the record as sparse. Rightly suspected as an OSS spy and sabotour,
[02:47:54] Watson had also been subjected to almost daily interrogation by North Koreans, Chinese, and even
[02:48:00] Russians who had drilled him on his exposure to the Gestapo in World War II but especially on the
[02:48:07] organization's methods and tactics of the peritube unit to which they knew he belonged.
[02:48:12] Watson's response to these and other questions had been a mixture of stony silence or intentional
[02:48:20] contradiction responses that had invariably earned him a switch across the eyes, a pistol barrel
[02:48:25] across the face or hours of kneeling with his nose pressed against a wall and then a stone on his head.
[02:48:33] Throughout these deprivations Watson had never lost his bearing or conviction,
[02:48:38] one standing during a packed camp lecture by a British speaker from the London daily worker
[02:48:44] to say that he didn't know what communism was and he didn't care to find out.
[02:48:50] Nor did he and his fellow POWs want to listen to this traitor,
[02:48:55] Kami Son of a bitch. For this affront and as is an example to other prisoners he was eventually
[02:49:03] frog marched before a military tribunal informed of the armistice then sentenced to death by firing
[02:49:10] squad. He still didn't talk. In the end after having been starved from 240 pounds to 120,
[02:49:21] his was an example that earned him the final distinction as the second to last UN POW to be released
[02:49:28] across the freedom bridge. On the other side he learned that the Rangers he had so steadfastly
[02:49:35] protected from exposure no longer existed. As far removed now from the army's interest as was the
[02:49:43] man who had resurrected them from the grave, a man whose accomplishments had disappointingly
[02:49:49] matched those of his past. About the same time that Operation Spitfire had been unraveling
[02:49:56] Colonel John Humege, the Korean War author of the army Rangers and Korean partisans
[02:50:03] had presented himself for the third time to the Quanson Hut maze of the eight armies headquarters
[02:50:08] in Pusan intent on securing a date for a partisan advance in a North Korea, a date for which he had
[02:50:13] long been waiting. The reply from his superior had been simple, never.
[02:50:21] After a year-long tour, McGee left Korea's ejected as he had left the Philippines,
[02:50:26] never again to have a chance to lead a partisan army on a campaign of liberation.
[02:50:31] On top of everything else he was branded the scapegoat for the failure of Virginia and Spitfire
[02:50:38] failures with consequences beyond a battered reputation.
[02:50:45] Yeah, the way that the army is treating special operations in this period is
[02:50:53] similar to the way that they dealt with them in World War II. They are created the
[02:51:00] Rangers. They attach them to divisions for control. In each instance, the divisional commanders,
[02:51:05] they don't see much distinction between the Rangers and their own infantry. So they treat them
[02:51:09] like infantry. Usually they use them as their frontline infantry and predictably they get
[02:51:16] mauled and then the commanders justify their own belief that they were just like infantry.
[02:51:20] The only thing that really could have kept the Rangers or the army from disbanding them would have
[02:51:27] been the sort of raid that McGee sends Watson and his team to complete, which is a penetration rate,
[02:51:38] a deep penetration raid behind enemy lines to destroy a tunnel. For lots of reasons,
[02:51:46] the rug gets pulled out from under this team before they even go and their chances of success
[02:51:53] before they even launch are diminished and almost nothing. They still go and like you read the
[02:51:59] passage that you read, I mean the survival, the lengths that they go just to survive are incredible.
[02:52:05] And this mission is almost completely lost to history. I mean when I started researching that mission
[02:52:11] and researching Watson, I didn't have a lot to go on. There's really only a couple of accounts
[02:52:17] about it and I had based off of what I had done, the research I had done from my World War
[02:52:24] Two chapters. I sort of knew or I sort of suspected that there would be like some
[02:52:29] post POW report about Watson. Couldn't find it the first time I went to the archives, but
[02:52:35] I knew that these reports were roughly two pages. Whenever anybody was recovered from a POW
[02:52:42] camp, the military would interview them, they would put the circumstances, their capture,
[02:52:47] and the circumstances of their captivity in these reports and they lock it away in an archive someplace.
[02:52:56] So I knew that this report probably existed. So I contacted the archives, they confirmed that the report
[02:53:03] did exist and being an Illinois at the time it wasn't super convenient for me to go back.
[02:53:09] I expected that the two pages wouldn't provide a ton of detail anyway, but I asked them,
[02:53:15] could you take a look at it and then send me the pages that his report.
[02:53:21] The archive was kind enough to do it. She went and she looked at the account and she said,
[02:53:25] yeah, the accounts in a file labeled such and such is the record of American POWs in the
[02:53:33] Korean War, but it's 750 pages. So I can't scan it and copy it and send it to you.
[02:53:38] I was like, well, can you just find his section and send me those pages and she said, no, it's 750 pages.
[02:53:44] It's not been cleared. You'd have to put a FOIA request and just to go through it to make sure that
[02:53:47] there's no classified information. So I put the FOIA request in, they go through, but they still
[02:53:52] won't send me the two pages. Anyway, I sort of forget about it. I've sort of moved on to
[02:53:57] another chapter. I figure if I'm going to find anything on the Virginia one raid and it's going to
[02:54:01] be the center of gravity of that chapter. I'll find it eventually. But it's sort of like I said,
[02:54:06] I put it on the back burner. I've already moved on. So I come to the archive several months later.
[02:54:12] And I remember I put this FOIA request and so I do a double check on it. End of a long day.
[02:54:17] My back is aching because of all the pictures that I've taken. You have to stand over these
[02:54:21] tables and take picture after picture. When I leave the archive after a day of research,
[02:54:26] I've got like 3,000 images. It's not fun. But at the end of the day, I think I've got about 30 minutes
[02:54:36] left. I find the archive. I'm like, hey, can you find this report from me? I'd like to take a look
[02:54:41] at and see what it is. She comes back with the 750 pages. I opened it up. It's not 750 pages of
[02:54:49] American POWs in the Korean War. It's 750 pages on Martin Watson. And no one has ever gone through it.
[02:54:58] Not since the day that they took the reports and put it in the archive. And it is,
[02:55:05] it's a gold mine. I mean, it had everything from his police reports. The circumstances of his
[02:55:11] captivity in Sostana, because he was part of Darby's Rangers. And then the fact that this person,
[02:55:17] he's present, not just for the consequential moment of the Rangers in World War II, but the consequential
[02:55:23] moment of the Rangers in the Korean War. Man, it's amazing. Account after account of all of the people
[02:55:30] that it's not just his interview. It's not just his post-captivity interview that's in the 750
[02:55:35] pages. It's interview after interview by his fellow captives. And they all have the same story about this
[02:55:41] guy. He is incomparable. And he gets a bronze star. After his captivity. And he gets a promotion
[02:55:50] to Sergeant. I mean, I couldn't, I mean, maybe Freeman and some instance of maybe Halper and a
[02:55:56] couple of others. I mean, nobody that I come across in the writing of that book is more deserving
[02:56:01] of the Medal of Honor. I mean, the the lengths that he went to for his own, for his own men,
[02:56:07] on that hilltop in the Virginia one mission. And then the lengths that he goes to just to survive
[02:56:12] in the POW camps and into escape. Noomers escape perhaps. I mean, but yeah, he's, I mean,
[02:56:20] I do have your next book identified yet. I got a good idea. The problem with the the the the
[02:56:28] the record is that there's no dates. And I thought, you know, you could write a book about Martin
[02:56:37] Watson. I think you would have to make it fiction though. You'd have enough material to write that
[02:56:43] that book, but you couldn't write it with the same level of specificity that I wrote this.
[02:56:47] Because you need the chronology to tell that story and the chronology.
[02:56:51] Just you could piece together the chronology from the other events that he's actually in.
[02:56:56] You could, I thought about it and you would have to find you'd have to go through each of the reports
[02:57:02] and track down, you know, the, you know, the 150 guys and see who's still alive to see if they
[02:57:09] can put, you know, some chronology to it. You would, I don't know. I have, I've thought about it.
[02:57:16] What happened to him after the war? I have to get out of the army after he was in the military
[02:57:20] notoriously promoted to sergeant. Yeah, right. He is, it doesn't have the, it's, it's not the best
[02:57:28] epitaph. He's, he ends up having some trouble. I mean, like, like I write in the book,
[02:57:35] his interwar period between his release from the German POW camp in World War II and the
[02:57:42] his entrance back into the army. It's punctuated by some 76 arrests by the the Connecticut police.
[02:57:48] And yeah, ranging from fighting to drunkenness back to fighting to resisting arrest. I mean,
[02:57:54] he has no, I mean, he clearly has, you know, post-traumatic stress, but he is also, you know,
[02:57:59] that's just who he was. Just grown up in the sort of like rough and tumble gang type environment.
[02:58:06] And, you know, he's, you know, he would be a nightmare to command, but, you know, also, you know,
[02:58:13] in Compton Blown Combat. But after the war, he, he marries, doesn't, doesn't go well. He's,
[02:58:21] you know, completely, you know, broken from the war. He ends up having a couple of kids,
[02:58:29] and then moving to Alaska to work on a pipeline. His son, who I have become, you know, friends with,
[02:58:36] is, is, every bit as big as his old man was. I mean, he's, you know, he's just, you know,
[02:58:42] some equally a monster. But the nicest guy that he ever made. But he, I think he met his dad,
[02:58:51] you know, maybe two dozen times. And the course of his life. And then, his, he passes away, I believe,
[02:58:58] from lung cancer. He smoked his entire entire life. And the, the password that his son
[02:59:04] would have to use to get into his hospital room was courage. So,
[02:59:17] Korean war ends, your next section is Arleigh Burke, the Bay of Pigs, and the launching of the
[02:59:25] Navy's Limited War Seals. You talk about Arleigh here. During the period of the CIA's
[02:59:37] preparations for the covert invasion invasion of Cuba, the US Navy was led by Admiral Arleigh Burke.
[02:59:43] The 58-year-old CNO, whose most conspicuous feature were a tight shock of curly bleached air,
[02:59:50] a fist of a chin that fell into a loose and swollen neck and a sizable bulk that had long
[02:59:57] since settled into his hips, a trait that gave said one witness a C roll to his stride and
[03:00:04] adjoined his shape, the impression of an upright base or a freighter. So there you got Arleigh Burke.
[03:00:14] Not an attractive man. Yeah. And here's an important part. And this is one of the,
[03:00:19] one of the parts where we start connecting this DNA of the SEAL teams to the DNA of the US Navy.
[03:00:25] In 1943, when Burke finally arrived in the South Pacific to take command of destroyers,
[03:00:30] Guadgarine 23, Desaron 23, the little beavers, he pinned himself to a drop-leaf desk and a
[03:00:36] sweltering belly of his command ship and crammed into his head a year's worth of combat reports
[03:00:40] every battle from coral sea to sevo island. A poll that the micro management of destroyers
[03:00:47] in which the permission to launch torpedoes against an already discovered enemy fleet was denied for
[03:00:54] for four immutable minutes. Burke crafted an entirely new doctrine of employment.
[03:01:00] Instead of spreading his destroyers around the fleets larger ships as nighttime submer subrene
[03:01:06] packets all dependent on permission from above to break guard duty to engage the enemy.
[03:01:11] Burke proposed to concentrate his ships at the head of the fleet and to govern his
[03:01:16] skippers, skippers under what has since been called the doctrine of faith. An unprecedented
[03:01:24] delegation of authority in which an enemy sighting would be immediately followed by a coordinated
[03:01:30] torpedo attack without orders. The use of all caps was Burke's to convey this attitude to his sailors,
[03:01:38] Burke issued them a 12 page, Mimeographed memo, whose very first lines read,
[03:01:44] if it will help kill japs, it's important. If it would not help kill japs, it's not important.
[03:01:51] Keep your ship trained for battle. Burke's list of non-battle-related orders was succinct.
[03:01:58] There were none. Corrections to this section will not be permitted.
[03:02:03] It took less than a month to make his point. That's Burke. You go through this thing and Burke
[03:02:14] is running the Navy and clearly he's an aggressive guy and believes in decentralized command.
[03:02:23] You do a great job of covering what happened at the Bay of Pigs, how that ties into our history
[03:02:30] and the seal teams. Pretty interesting story the way that unfolds. It ends up with
[03:02:40] a horrible situation, but we do gain some experience and we work with some of these
[03:02:45] cubanationalists that helped us out as well. This is the toughest chapter. Each of the chapters
[03:02:54] presented various challenges when it came to researching and trying to craft the narrative
[03:02:58] or trying to figure out what's the point of this chapter and how does this serve the story?
[03:03:07] Or how does this push us forward? What aspects of Burke's personality or Burke's own history?
[03:03:16] How is that relevant? You hit the nail right on the head when it comes to Burke's
[03:03:23] emphasis on latitude and decentralized command. Other thing about Burke that's really important
[03:03:29] or that's essential about him is that he refuses to allow the other branches of service to define
[03:03:36] what the Navy is. The revolt of the animals are in that period during the interwar period
[03:03:44] between World War II and the Korean War. The other branches of the service are trying to tell the Navy
[03:03:48] that we need to really de-arm ourselves and become more of a merchant marine which to Burke is a
[03:03:57] nantama. He has no interest in commanding a Navy that's just a support or a transport unit.
[03:04:04] To Burke, the Navy is nothing if it's not an instrument of offensive warfare. He's constantly
[03:04:12] when he becomes the Siano and he becomes the Siano for a period longer than even the
[03:04:17] closest competitor. It's a normally a two-year job. He's the Siano for six years.
[03:04:23] No one has the influence on the U.S. Navy that Arleigh Burke does. So when he becomes the Siano
[03:04:30] constantly, the entire time he's constantly looking for opportunities to push the Navy
[03:04:35] into a more offensive role. So he champions this limited war capability. He sees enemies all over the
[03:04:43] globe and he's trying to figure out how the Navy can either bring forces to bear launch
[03:04:49] marine launch missiles, launch naval gunfire and that orientation ultimately creates this unit.
[03:05:02] But like I said, writing the book creates, you know, present structuring and research challenges,
[03:05:10] you know, every chapter is hard to write. This chapter though, this was probably the easiest
[03:05:16] chapter when it came to write the first draft because there's been so much produced about
[03:05:22] Arleigh Burke. Numerous books, a couple of pretty good with lots and lots of corroborative detail in
[03:05:29] them and then, you know, just finding, you know, his fingerprints all over those documents,
[03:05:34] the create the seal teams, they're all over. I mean, everything, all the, all the documents that
[03:05:39] his office is creating, but then you can see his little scratches and his pen scratches and all these
[03:05:44] documents because he writes with, I think it's a green pen and you can see him still on the documents
[03:05:48] when you go to the the Navy yard today. The problem with this chapter, the Dick of the Bay of Pigspart
[03:05:56] is just finding the material because it's, you know, the CIA still involved and, you know,
[03:06:00] I can't tell you how many times I tried to get documents out of the CIA, it's a black hole.
[03:06:05] You just can't get them. So I finally was able to track down the actual Cuban frogmen that
[03:06:12] the participated in the raid and all of them were just, you know, totally generous with their
[03:06:17] time. So, you know, the book is written almost sequentially. There's a couple of chapters that I wrote
[03:06:21] out of order, but this chapter in particular is the one that just sort of kept me up at night until
[03:06:25] the end. She's like, I know there's more material out there and I've got to get it into the book
[03:06:30] and I mean, short of going down to Miami and meeting with the actual, or because I closely
[03:06:36] using it and they close the bad big news amp, but I managed to find them and their accounts are in there.
[03:06:42] Yeah, it's an epic epic retelling of that. Again, that's why you got to get this book to read these
[03:06:50] sections because I'm not covered at all today. But we do get Kennedy, we get Kennedy who now is
[03:06:57] really focused on this idea, the small war idea, the counter insurgency idea, the guerilla war for
[03:07:02] idea. He's all over it. He starts pushing people in that direction. He needs someone to run
[03:07:09] the special warfare center at Fort Bragg, where's the where the green berets come from, where they get
[03:07:13] this like their schoolhouse. He ends up talking one of his friends, his one of his military aids
[03:07:21] who recommends a guy to run it. This guy named Colonel Bill Yarbrough, who's another character in
[03:07:29] the story. At the change of command ceremony, his soldiers observed him as he was, average size,
[03:07:37] chest out, shoulders back, a rooster of a man, his narrowed eyes and purse lifts locked into a
[03:07:42] stoic gaze as revealing as a Roman bust. Son of an army colon colonel, married to an army
[03:07:47] brat with a son on his way to an army commission and two daughters on their way to army husbands.
[03:07:52] Yarbrough was the very picture of army tradition. 48 years old now in press slacks and blouse boots
[03:07:58] with no prior special, no prior experience in special forces, nothing on the surface seemed to indicate
[03:08:04] anything besides a conventional background and a preference for more of the same. But that was just
[03:08:09] the surface. Beneath his obvious soldierly bearing was hidden an ambition for a military organization
[03:08:15] as unconventional as had ever existed, born into a military family and predictably funneled into
[03:08:21] a West Point education, where his only step out of formation seems to have been as a cartoonist
[03:08:26] on the school newspaper. Yarbrough's early army career was in fact a litany of non-conformities,
[03:08:32] four years with the Philippine scouts, one of the most unconventional assignments in the US army.
[03:08:37] Two years as a parachute test officer during which his creativity had burst open as wide as
[03:08:44] the thing he was testing. This had manifested in everything from redesigning the parachute
[03:08:49] press pants to boots, to promoting his untested unit by acting as a stunt double for a Hollywood
[03:08:55] movie for which he was afterwards afterward nicknamed Show Biz. And in creating a silver badge
[03:09:02] that looked like an ice cream comb shaped parachute flexed with winged angels that was ultimately
[03:09:07] adopted as the symbol for the entire airborne. In World War II Yarbrough survived incomparible
[03:09:13] five combat jumps, five camp pains, two combat commands, one of which had fought alongside
[03:09:20] Darby's Rangers at Sistarna and later earned a presidential unit citation and one crash landing.
[03:09:26] And except for a brief sidelining resulting from an outburst against his division commander
[03:09:31] Matthew Ridgeway, it was an almost unblemished record of direct action with a record,
[03:09:36] a record with honor so compelling that any normal soldier would have coveted its repetition.
[03:09:42] Yarbrough wasn't normal. What was the outburst about Ridgeway? Remember?
[03:09:51] Yeah, I'm trying to think it was it was an airant drop. I believe in Italy.
[03:10:00] An airant drop of the parachute troopers or an airant drop of a bomb from the fire situation.
[03:10:05] No of paratroopers. Okay. Yeah, they landed them in a place that they shouldn't have landed them and
[03:10:11] he returned from that and he does something that you just can't do in the army. He, you know,
[03:10:17] let's as boss have it. Matthew Ridgeway is not. Matthew Ridgeway is another hero of the story,
[03:10:22] but you know, maybe not hero of the story. He's a hero of an American hero,
[03:10:26] but he's an executioner of the Rangers in Korea, but he's also the executioner of Yarbrough's
[03:10:32] sort of rise to infantry or paratrooper greatness. He shortsurcuses career, sends him back to the
[03:10:39] states. I think the only way that Yarbrough gets back into command is through a Mark Clark.
[03:10:46] But yeah, it was, um, yeah, Yarbrough. Yarbrough, Yarbrough. He is a,
[03:10:56] probably next to Kaufman. I don't think I met anybody who was, his toughness just sort of pinned
[03:11:04] down. Like, what does he want? Because I mean, his, his whole background seems to imply that he's,
[03:11:11] you know, just this conventional, you know, soldier, but he has no interest in it. And I,
[03:11:16] you know, that I, I couldn't find, you know, the letter, the document, uh, to, you know, suggest,
[03:11:21] you know, why he, um, was sort of turning his back on that and why he, you know, bought in so,
[03:11:27] you know, full heartedly to this idea of counter insurgency, but nevertheless it's there. He
[03:11:33] becomes the biggest, uh, disciple or a passallor, whatever you want to call him, of counter insurgency,
[03:11:39] of, you know, winning, uh, you know, the, the, the, the hearts and minds of the people,
[03:11:44] and then turning them or at least denying them to the enemy. And, uh, the way that you did that
[03:11:49] is not through combat. It's through all the stuff that nobody likes to do. It's digging well.
[03:11:55] Yeah, digging it. It becomes real obvious, you see, here, Yarbrough's first action is commander
[03:12:00] of the Naval Special Warfare Center and top train of special forces was to initiate a top to
[03:12:04] bottom of a view of training and curriculum and effort to match his men with their mission.
[03:12:08] So here we go into fast forward a little bit before along, the special warfare center began to feel
[03:12:13] less like a command, of course, and more like a college campus complete with courses in bridge building,
[03:12:18] sanitation, animal husbandry, axmithing, crop raising, pig pen construction, swine and
[03:12:24] occupation, leaflet creation, field irrigation, seed planning and rice cultivation. Not all of
[03:12:30] Yarbrough and, and, of course, there's resistance. Not all of Yarbrough staff are proof of the changes.
[03:12:34] Particularly said Yarbrough, the old jockstrap commandos, the Ranger types, gallant bloodletters
[03:12:40] and fighting machines to be sure about men who are anything but diplomats and rejected any
[03:12:44] suggestion that they ought to be. They were he continued men devoid of the more humane qualities,
[03:12:49] compassion, pity and mercy, men who bristle that the idea of lying on their bellies to teach
[03:12:54] and illiterate tribes and in on how to aim a rifle. So he's got a totally different idea of
[03:13:00] really what the green berets should be. And he's got another little, he's got another
[03:13:08] little different opinion too. Here fast forward a little bit to convert his men to his new
[03:13:12] philosophy as warfare. My religion, he would one day call it in which battles, the battles objective
[03:13:18] was not the destruction of the enemy of an enemy's army but the winning of indigenous minds and
[03:13:23] sympathies. That must be the precursor of hearts and minds. Yarbrough enjoyed every one of his
[03:13:29] officers above the rank of captain to accompany him into the pine berets for what he called
[03:13:34] his talk in the woods. As long as I am charged of special forces, he would say there will be no
[03:13:41] womanizing, no drunkenness, no wild parties, no adultery. There'll be no trouble makers, no wild
[03:13:46] men. That stuff is out. There will be moral standards, disciplinary standards, apparent standards.
[03:13:53] The rules are going to change. He would promise there will be a new start.
[03:13:58] So he's coming hard. He's coming hard. And this, that chapter in particular. So I talked about
[03:14:06] some of the challenges of other chapters and you know either you know finding material or
[03:14:10] figuring out what the chapter is about and how that chapter served the larger story. The story
[03:14:15] of the special forces presented a problem but I was not prepared for. Every chapter took about
[03:14:23] you know between six, around six, seven months to write. When I got to and and they all followed
[03:14:32] a similar pattern, you know, whether the unit was a Navy unit that we're talking about where it's
[03:14:43] being created, committed to action and then it's retained in the order of battle or whether it's an
[03:14:50] army or marine core unit that is created and then disbanded. There was there was this pattern
[03:14:56] that was sort of predictable, you know, Navy unit created army unit disbanded or marine core whatever.
[03:15:04] When you get to and it fit with, you know, my understanding of my thesis which was the Navy's
[03:15:11] continuing to fill this gap in the order of battle and that held until the special forces.
[03:15:18] When I get to the special forces like my thesis sort of like started to crumble and I had this
[03:15:22] moment of like panic where I was like, I mean the only thing I can do is just ignore the entire
[03:15:29] existence of the special forces because it's I mean it doesn't fit with what I've been doing for
[03:15:33] the past, you know, seven years and when I, you know, obviously it's not what I did, I think because
[03:15:42] it's not the right thing to do because you're telling a history you have to, you know, understand
[03:15:46] the relationship. You can't just change history to history. I mean you mean there's so many times
[03:15:51] if you're writing history that, you know, the temptation is there you want to, you know, make the
[03:15:55] facts fit your narrative. That's not, that's not honest and it's not what you're supposed to do. So
[03:16:00] I ended up having to take an entire year and did nothing but, you know, really learn the history
[03:16:07] of the Army Special Forces, which is a fascinating history. But it also, you know, revealed
[03:16:13] within, you know, three or four months that it wasn't the fact that the special forces was, you know,
[03:16:18] created committed action and disbanded. It was that they were completely reoriented to a non-commanded
[03:16:25] type mission and no one was more consequential in that shift than your bro. Yeah, the, the end
[03:16:35] up, the gap that all these other Raider units would fill and then to get disbanded, he didn't
[03:16:40] go into that gap. He went into this other gap. He went into this other gap and then then there was a gap
[03:16:44] that was created by President Kennedy and, and trying to connect those two people, I couldn't
[03:16:51] figure it out until I found that article about Spartacus about Kennedy watching this movie.
[03:16:55] Yeah, he gets into the cell that story. I'm not going to cover it, but tell that story.
[03:16:59] In the, in the, in the months leading up to his inauguration, he's, he's been elected, but he
[03:17:06] hasn't yet become president. He gets his brother tells him how great the movie, how the
[03:17:13] Kirk dog of this movie Spartacus is. And you know, his, you know, in coming Secretary of the Navy
[03:17:20] happens to be going as an extra ticket, you know, Mr. President Alec, would you like to go?
[03:17:24] So he goes. And the movie's already started. The theater owner sees, you know, Kennedy come in,
[03:17:30] stops everything, brings him upstairs, they have a cup of coffee together, everybody, all the other
[03:17:34] theater goers that are waiting for him to start. So it goes down with the cup of coffee,
[03:17:39] restarts the movie and he watches the thing and he comes out and he's, I mean, it's a, if you've
[03:17:45] ever seen, you know, Spartacus, it's, you know, it's the epic. I mean, when I was a kid, I saw it, it was,
[03:17:50] I mean, I've never seen anything like it in, and it makes an impression on him. And where, you know,
[03:17:57] it's a, it's a slave army that, you know, is fighting across Italy and they're, liberating other slaves
[03:18:05] and they're turning them into gladiators. And that's what Kennedy wants to do. And he sees in this
[03:18:10] movie he sees an answer to his problem. You know, we're going to turn these, you know,
[03:18:15] legions of, you know, third world, you know, people into, you know, our army of freedom.
[03:18:24] And Yarbob brought into that. But into it. Oh, yeah. Meanwhile, fast forward a little bit.
[03:18:33] Chapter 11. At one o'clock on January 1st, 1962, a Monday,
[03:18:39] sealed team one was without fanfare of any kind, unceremoniously commissioned on naval amphibious
[03:18:46] base coronado right where the neck of San Diego's palm treeed resort island met the flat
[03:18:52] seven mile long sandy itsmus called the silver strand located on this base up an inch of military
[03:18:59] grade right angles that jutted out into the sparkling waters of San Diego Bay. The team's physical
[03:19:04] footprint was little more than a single ward war to era quansit hut. The team's authorized
[03:19:11] strength was for 10 officers in 50 enlisted men, most of whom had not yet been pulled from their
[03:19:16] west coast underwater demolition teams. The man most responsible for recruiting, equipping and training
[03:19:23] these men was their 29 year old commanding officer lieutenant David Del Judas.
[03:19:30] Raise just outside a Newark New Jersey by Italian speaking, working class parents Del Judas
[03:19:37] was of average height and athletic build and like nearly every other frogman well-tanned.
[03:19:44] As an officer at UDT-12, he had been selected to lead a 10-man detachment of Vietnam on a two-week
[03:19:53] trip up the May Kong River to deliver landing craft to Lui, Lai Ocean troops, troops at the army
[03:19:59] special forces were already training for combat, briefed on the insurgents and the men you
[03:20:03] of reptiles that he and his men were sure to encounter, they had seen neither just 100 miles of
[03:20:07] mud-browned river. Now Del Judas was in charge of a unit that had been created in no small
[03:20:13] part to return to that river but to what end no one quite knew. So there you go, seal teams get commissioned.
[03:20:21] And this is when all the history finally you know start to collide. It culminates in this and
[03:20:34] and you know the individual that collides in as Phil Bacquillou who's been there
[03:20:43] literally from the beginning of Naval Special Warfare and there's a reason that you know the
[03:20:49] Naval Special Warfare Center is named after this person. The Phil H. Bucklou Center for Naval Special Warfare
[03:20:55] Yeah, I mean it wouldn't I mean he he doesn't create you know the the scouts and raiders
[03:21:01] don't create the UDTs he doesn't create the seal teams but he's there for these critical moments
[03:21:09] to help the seal teams along. And his his ability to form relationships his ability to write
[03:21:18] because he was obviously with any super humble and and is able to get his conveyance message apart.
[03:21:26] Yeah, convey his message in such a way that really there's only one answer but he never
[03:21:31] gives the answer. It's like he allows people to discover the truth for themselves which is the best way
[03:21:35] to get people to discover the truth. Better than I can't have said it. Yes. We're sure I have that in there.
[03:21:41] Yeah, he writes these well we'll get to it.
[03:21:44] Phil H. Bucklou. When he had left his house on December 7, 1941 Phil H. Bucklou was a six foot
[03:21:53] two inch 235 pound former fullback for the Cleveland Rams who's major concerned that morning
[03:21:58] had been to choose one of the four football contracts burning a hole in his pocket with thinning
[03:22:03] hair and a heavy jaw curled lip and downturned eyes not to mention a torso as thick as a tree trunk
[03:22:09] Bucklou at 26 looked 10 years old when he was and was 10 times as mean while intimidating from a distance
[03:22:16] Bucklou up close actually possessed a personality that accomplished the opposite. He had never
[03:22:21] attracted to his orbit enough players to found that coaches own football team. The ors are he
[03:22:27] had even attracted enough players to his orbit to found and coaches own football team the Columbus
[03:22:33] bullies a team on its way to another league championship had the Japanese not exploded the afternoon
[03:22:41] as they did. If I would have known about the Columbus bullies my task in a task in a bruiser might
[03:22:45] have been the task in a bullies instead. One of those things.
[03:22:52] In the Sicily campaign he had checked to check the beach himself and fast forward a little bit
[03:22:57] then signal to the fleet from the bobbing shell of a black and kayak while screaming balls
[03:23:01] of fire skipped off the water round him in the weeks before normandy invasion he skimmed to the
[03:23:05] coast and collected density testing bottom samples to up to 20 yards from the shore.
[03:23:10] Then evaded a flattilla of six enemy trawlers and a crash of bullet snaps from
[03:23:15] MG 42 machine gun by escaping into the night and fog on the smoke grade dawn of D day buckloon
[03:23:20] his LCT scout boat crew led the first wave of floating tanks to Omaha Beach fired earspitting
[03:23:26] rockets and twin 50 cow machine guns to silence in enemy pillbox then spent the day
[03:23:30] throttling through bread clouded water and mine topped obstacles to pluck drowning soldiers
[03:23:35] from burning land in craft. Fast forward for his service in World War II buckloon received an
[03:23:42] unheard of number of commendations a bronze star from North Africa a silver star for Solono
[03:23:47] and then a brace of navy crosses one for Sicily another for Omaha Beach not even his friend
[03:23:54] in fellow footballer buck helper and had been awarded as many. Naturally such a record had opened
[03:23:59] doors to more unconventional opportunities including two and a half years in Korea more than twice
[03:24:04] the length of a standard war tour where buckloon doubled as the navy's represented to the CIA
[03:24:09] and led the beach jumpers a navy unit created to collect and jam the enemy's electronic
[03:24:14] communications or periodically mimic them to so chaos in their transmissions. So there's just
[03:24:20] some of the stuff that you talk about that that buckloose got going on and that's another one of
[03:24:26] those units to the beach jumpers right another one of these random units that the navy puts
[03:24:31] together freaking just get some. So he's got to write this report we're talking about why he had to
[03:24:39] write this report. He had to write the report because the original commander got sent home and
[03:24:47] the reason the original commander of the the commission or the survey team
[03:24:51] we don't know if he was sent home for a health problem or as one person said for a closet
[03:25:00] drunkenness but they I mean the the the point of this report that there's sent to
[03:25:08] to create is to figure out what the hell the navy's supposed to do in Vietnam. It's not a
[03:25:13] it's not a theater that any naval commander is eager to you know insert himself into.
[03:25:18] So there's no early Burke at the home of the navy at this point so the character of
[03:25:28] naval leadership is slightly different maybe not as aggressive but they still want to you know
[03:25:32] see what the navy can do so they send the survey team but the people that they select for the
[03:25:37] survey team are almost you know they're sort of they're waiting the scales a little bit I mean
[03:25:47] they send David Del Judas who is you know he's the commanding officer of the team one they
[03:25:53] send a filial killer who's a former UDT guy from the Pacific theater silver star winner
[03:25:59] and they sent full buckler was the second in command who is you know nobody has had a more
[03:26:03] inland naval experience outside of the sealed teams in this guy. Make him the number two
[03:26:10] the commanding officer gets sent home putting full buckler in charge of this report they spend the next
[03:26:15] six weeks two months you know hopscotch in the country trying to figure out what to do and
[03:26:23] the report that he creates is entirely his I mean he let's no one else take the responsibility for
[03:26:31] this report he drafts it himself he types it himself even he doesn't have a yomendo a he
[03:26:35] did you see original copies of this thing yeah freaking legit and it took a surprisingly long time
[03:26:41] to find it I couldn't find it anywhere I know you have images of these things are you take pictures
[03:26:46] of all these things yeah my having images of that night um yeah I don't I don't have any of the
[03:26:51] original documents there's um left everything at the archive where it should be but if you need
[03:26:55] smuggle any out not saying that the temptation wasn't there because some of the archives that I you
[03:27:01] know went to you know they're uh some of their record keeping you know has a little bit to be desired
[03:27:08] and you want to protect you know this history you know uh but no I never you know that it's all
[03:27:13] there but yes found the report and uh yeah holding it is a little weird holding a lot of these
[03:27:20] documents because you you know you haven't touched are most likely no one's touched some of the stuff
[03:27:26] since they were printed off a type off or whatever you have here according to buckler this is the
[03:27:34] report according to buckler the battle required something not unlike the riverine force used in
[03:27:40] the American Civil War in which set Abraham Lincoln Uncle Sam's web feet had fought not only in the
[03:27:46] deep sea and the broad bay but also up the narrow muddy bay you and wherever the ground was a little
[03:27:52] damp it's quite a great I mean quotes freaking Abraham Lincoln this report this guy's crafty
[03:27:57] for an unconventional example in a modified amphibious environment buckler could have drawn attention to
[03:28:04] his own legacy he didn't he never did so the humility Lincoln's fleet was example enough
[03:28:10] and practical terms his solution for the navy here to four failure was a comprehensive overhaul
[03:28:16] of the entire counter infiltration effort then you talk about this idea of counter infiltration
[03:28:22] as opposed to counter has opposed to counterinsurgs they want to keep the the infiltrators
[03:28:27] the the communists from pushing into south Vietnam it's a blockade I mean that's a traditional
[03:28:31] navy mission maybe doesn't understand counterinsurgency maybe there's much more comfortable with
[03:28:37] with a blockade right and and so therefore according therefore more navy boots more navy
[03:28:43] boarding teams more riverine checkpoints submarine nets navigation lights a system for checking
[03:28:48] cargo manifests and forcing and forcing curve views and exchange for all this more navy representation
[03:28:55] in four core planning on the question of whether the navy was missing the boat on counter
[03:29:01] insurgency the winning of the locals loyalty through civic action and leading the indigenous
[03:29:07] troops buckler's report was comparatively silent especially given the date just 86 days since
[03:29:13] Kennedy's assassination though he recommended increased boat supports two special forces
[03:29:18] camps he already judged the green berets efforts as slow in time consuming and therefore in effective
[03:29:23] fast forward a little bit in its 46 pages the report used the term counterinsurgency only two times
[03:29:31] or sorry only three times a somewhat nebulous field buckler would one day call it four fewer mentions
[03:29:38] than the term counter infiltration the reports preferred mission appearing at total of 10 times
[03:29:45] was a variant of the term rating a tactic that could said the report in gender more fight back
[03:29:53] spirit amongst the rag sailors though those were the south Vietnamese trained riverine sailors
[03:29:59] but would require companies of pursuit raiders preferably marines or rangers and who would
[03:30:06] accompany such and who would command such raids on this question the former scout radar
[03:30:11] turned sake ogorella did not blink the overwater transport of rating and landing forces should
[03:30:17] be a navy responsibility yeah that I mean that that part alone I mean the fact that he doesn't
[03:30:25] even mention seals in that I mean clearly the navy thinks like I mean if there's not like a little
[03:30:31] you know you know that when the teacher you know pounds on the chalkboard says hey you might
[03:30:35] want to remember this for the test like that's what he's saying like hey don't you guys think
[03:30:40] that you want to be doing this mission and the army and the main person like
[03:30:43] yeah crazy nine days later on February 25th 1964 the buckler report the name by which even
[03:30:52] McNamara would refer to it was officially distributed to leaders across the navy
[03:30:56] Matt V in the joint chiefs of staff eventually rising to the office of secretary defense
[03:31:02] it was handled said buckler like a hot potato actually was more like a gauntlet a challenge to the
[03:31:07] navy's leaders to not only directly fight an inland river war but to fight it in a way that mostly
[03:31:13] deviated from the consensus strategy of counter insurgency over the next two years this challenge
[03:31:18] would propel the navy toward the development of new vessels new organizations and most importantly
[03:31:24] new missions including the reports most recommended rating beyond the river banks so there it is
[03:31:35] from there the seal start creeping inland that's what starts happening and and here's the
[03:31:42] intro that i started this this podcast out with um debt one silting one debt golf billy making
[03:31:49] that's what's happening from there they start they start making adjustments to training
[03:31:56] right this is the navy has set up the seal teams they haven't created i mean they created the
[03:32:00] seal teams but they haven't determined what the seal teams are going to be they've raised them like
[03:32:04] a parent was going to raise a child they like planted a seed right but the child is ultimately
[03:32:08] going to be the one who decides what his future is going to be like and they you know all of this
[03:32:13] has come together into this last you know last two chapters like here we are uh and you know they
[03:32:21] they have trouble in the beginning they're almost sent home they all the seals almost completely
[03:32:25] missed the war anyway the you uh some so that the guys start coming back from those via nom
[03:32:32] deployments and like i said they start making adjustments because they're creeping more and more inland
[03:32:37] um i like this one some of these things some of these things just warm my heart because
[03:32:45] because i'm so connected to them right so here we go back to the book frustrated with the enemies
[03:32:49] retreat from the rung sats river banks debt golf had already started pushing further inland so far
[03:32:54] in fact that seal team ones replacement platoons were now anticipating almost nothing but helicopter
[03:32:59] insertions so we're we might not even be in the water at all not even next to a river to better
[03:33:04] prepare for this inland land warfare seal team ones Anderson had ordered guy stone a former
[03:33:11] Korean war soldier and forward observer who had left the army to be government-listed seal
[03:33:16] to create a six week long pre-deployment course in basic infantry tactics with a training camp
[03:33:23] carved into the chocolate mountains some 100 miles east of the Pacific Ocean stone had trained
[03:33:28] his team one comrades in every skill of soldiering that he knew everything from contour navigating
[03:33:33] to mortars every skill a step closer to navy infantrymen to the commanders now convened and
[03:33:41] coronado such development seemed to justify an official revision to the navies to the seals
[03:33:47] navy imposed operational boundaries in other words what deljudice anderson and early were
[03:33:53] describing as direct missions outside of a purely naval or maritime environment as they already knew
[03:34:00] there was only one other available area that could present a navy unit with that kind of opportunity
[03:34:05] an area contemporary a contemporary described as the wars true bastion of iron the maycon delta
[03:34:15] yeah i've had some some Vietnam seals on here but that connection to our west coast desert training
[03:34:22] facility that's it man like that's you go out there and you know i had Roger Hayden on here
[03:34:28] was a Vietnam yeah just uh well it's right you worked at work on but he was you know he'd
[03:34:34] start talking about being out there at the desert training facility and like they set up the point
[03:34:40] man course when they put booby traps and targets and all that like that's what i did when i got
[03:34:45] silting one you went out there and you did the point man course everybody did the point man course
[03:34:49] that came directly from these guys in Vietnam so that these things are um you can still you can
[03:34:56] still i still have that thread yeah i'm gonna push forward a little bit
[03:35:08] get into some some of these stories that you you you get from the fighting that the seals
[03:35:16] start doing as they push in and this is the this is where the reputation really starts to stand strong
[03:35:22] on a jump into the middle of a mission here realizing that the enemy was already moving to cut
[03:35:28] them off galager decided the only thing left to do was fight this decision made he directed his
[03:35:34] men to make for the only cover around alone pezance house but to win just 20 uncomfortable yards
[03:35:40] away from the nearest tree line when they reached it their first job was to calm the family inside
[03:35:45] not an easy task for any home invader and one in which the squad was only partially successful as
[03:35:51] two children quickly escaped sure to eventually tell the vehicle on their position next most important
[03:35:56] was to check the wounded y'all's entire left side was starting to freeze up and fix whatever was wrong
[03:36:03] with the radio the same troubleshooting checklist of cleaning connectors swapping out handsets
[03:36:08] changing batteries plus a healthy amount of cursing and praying this troubleshooting however
[03:36:14] was only partially successful when sure finally got the radio back online the only other person who
[03:36:21] could hear him was jack roul the radio man for seven a and they had problems of their own
[03:36:26] at a little before three a m Peterson and squad seven a consider themselves in a very difficult position
[03:36:34] everywhere they looked in the surrounding tree line there was movement at one point Peterson had
[03:36:38] even seen torches what seemed like hundreds of them moving toward their south
[03:36:44] but as they were now finding out over the radio it could have been even worse once galager and
[03:36:49] seven bees situation was learned Peterson was quick to count his blessing first he had none of
[03:36:56] galager's casualties except for the lyrp who had shot the man Peterson had meant to interrogate
[03:37:02] every one of his men still had a full load of load out of ammunition next was his position
[03:37:07] clear field of fire and every direction and the cemetery's berm for cover even concrete
[03:37:12] vaults if the enemy brought in his mortars most important of all roul's radio was now working as
[03:37:18] it should putting the squad in reach of army slicks and navy sea wolves who were at that moment
[03:37:24] on their way to seven a's wreck rescue or at least they had been. Recognizing seven bees
[03:37:30] overwhelming need Peterson quickly made two decisions first he ordered roul to relay seven
[03:37:36] bees position to the helicopters effectively putting his own squad at the back of the line
[03:37:41] second and this decision was made by default of the first seven a would now fight the encircling
[03:37:46] enemy alone. Just as Peterson's decision was made and the helicopters began diverting south
[03:37:52] a group of some thirty-vehacong fighters as if sensing seven a's sudden vulnerability
[03:37:57] step clear of the eastern woodline spread themselves into a scream of scourmeters and started
[03:38:03] forward. The first wave was coming and no one knew what was coming behind it.
[03:38:09] Having been forced to spend the first few minutes at the farmhouse calming peasants
[03:38:14] dressing wounds and fixing the radio galager despite shards of metal in his legs was now
[03:38:20] checking each man's field of fire and telling him to hold that fire until he gave the order.
[03:38:25] As men organized their positions with easily accessible stacks of ammunition and grenades
[03:38:30] they scanned their sectors for any sign of movement. They didn't have to scan line
[03:38:35] scan long soon between the rice bales there was movement everywhere.
[03:38:39] Look at them all said boin. It looks like hundreds of them. But as best you could tell
[03:38:45] hundreds who by their milling around still had no idea where the Americans were.
[03:38:52] Right about the time that boin was making that assessment hooked her received what they had been
[03:38:58] quietly desperate for. The check-in procedures from lieutenant commander Myers of the Navy C
[03:39:03] Wolves who rattled off the loadout first flight of two helicopters. Wings rack with 2.75 inch
[03:39:10] rockets and machine guns then gave his altitude and vicinity a racetrack in the sky far enough away
[03:39:17] so as to not reveal seven bees position. In response to your gave a physical description of the
[03:39:22] rice paddy and seven bees location in it along with the rapidly deteriorating situation
[03:39:28] multiple wounded and enemy everywhere. The next call was the lead pilot of the army's flight of
[03:39:35] slicks who upon hearing of seven bees situation replied he would not be able to help as it was a
[03:39:42] quote violation of squadron policy to land in a hot LZ end quote. What happened next is a matter of
[03:39:48] some dispute. One account suggests that the seawolf pilots may have shamed their army peers by offering
[03:39:54] to pick up the seals themselves or at least the wounded. The Navy fuselage could only handle
[03:39:59] one or two men. Another explicitly claims that the seawolf commander told the army pilot
[03:40:05] you're going to go down or I'm going to shoot you down. Whatever the truth within a few minutes
[03:40:10] the matter was resolved and Gallagher told Ture to tell the helicopters what he wanted.
[03:40:15] At a little before 315 a.m. the moon behind him two seawolf started their attack run across the
[03:40:21] rice paddy as they closed with the tree line someone in the squad there's some dispute as to who
[03:40:26] stepped out of the farmhouse, ripped the pole ring on a marked 13 signal flare and tossed it in the
[03:40:31] grass. Within a second the flare ignited a bonfire size glow that told the pilots exactly where
[03:40:37] the seals were but also drew the bullet snaps of every muzzle now blazing from the tree line.
[03:40:43] As the seals flinch beneath the fire and responded with their own the world above them exploded
[03:40:48] with the swamp of the two gunships strafing the enemies muzzle flashes with their rockets and
[03:40:53] form machine guns. With the landing skids directly above them the combination of rotor blades
[03:40:58] and rocket exhaust nearly ripped the roof off the farmhouse. As the seawolfs unleashed this chaos
[03:41:05] several seals got online and followed suit launching grenades and shredding through belts of
[03:41:10] stone arounds they had so as so linked. The noise was unbelievable. Row one man afterward and it
[03:41:18] looked like something not of this world. Behind this cover the army pilot reluctantly landed his
[03:41:24] slick and Gallagher directed the firing line of seals to begin bounding back toward it. While the
[03:41:29] firing line covered Mike Boitian transformed himself into an ambulance cradling men from the
[03:41:35] cooch to the helicopter then helping to shoulder yaw to a seat cram between the pilot and copilot.
[03:41:40] Finding Gallagher limping away from the firing line his rifle still in hand and compressing
[03:41:45] a fresh gunshot wound and leaning into the rotor wash like it was a driving rain. Boitian picked
[03:41:50] him up and heaved him so hard into the helicopters, opened door that he flew right out the other
[03:41:55] side. That accident forced Boitian to run all the way around the helicopter and repeat the effort
[03:42:01] finally stashing Gallagher all the way in the back. Once everyone was finally loaded the pilot
[03:42:06] eagerly applied his collective pitch control lever until several knocks on the helmet forced him
[03:42:12] to look back. Hey we still got men on the ground, Boitian yelled above the noise. At this the pilot
[03:42:18] depressed his collective just in time for Roy Matthews the barrel of his stoner glowing hot red
[03:42:24] to dash from the pooch and clamber aboard rounds now clanking against the fuselage.
[03:42:29] This time the pilot's lift off sent a shutter throughout the entire helicopter,
[03:42:34] prompting yaw to crane his head toward the dash where he saw an RPM indicator flashing red.
[03:42:40] While gaining the next hundred feet of elevation the helicopter shook like it would suddenly drop
[03:42:44] out of the sky, a feeling that only intensified when every gun still connected to a living communist
[03:42:50] finger started firing and surrounding the slick with green tracers. It was a barrage that had
[03:42:56] resulted from the near simultaneous lift off of the sea wolves because they had somewhere else to be.
[03:43:08] Yeah I mean then you you go into talk about how they go now and take care of Peterson and
[03:43:16] seven alpha. I mean if I had written any slower this would not have been written because the you know a lot of the
[03:43:26] guys that gave me the stories from this thing are no longer here. Ron yaw just passed away a couple
[03:43:31] months ago. Men just died Bob Gallagher just died. All the history is you know very, very slowly but
[03:43:38] it's happening. I mean one of the last things that Pete Peterson well one of the last interactions I had
[03:43:47] with Pete because Pete was more than generous with his time to do interviews with us but one of the
[03:43:52] last things that he did was I sent him a Gallicopy of the book before it had published to get it
[03:43:59] in Bob Gallagher's hands so he could see this. I want to you know every you know all the folks that I
[03:44:06] interviewed from seven plateau in the one person that would not be actually a spot Gallagher.
[03:44:13] That said I still was anxious for him to know you know the legacy and the contribution that he had
[03:44:21] you know not just to the seal teams but to you know establishing you know what ultimately the
[03:44:26] seal teams became the mission that the seal teams have. So sent the copy of the book to Pete
[03:44:34] drove it over to Bob's house and Pete you know didn't get an information on whether or not he
[03:44:41] actually read it but after Bob passed they found the copy of the book in his house with a note inside
[03:44:50] that said to past this book onto his best friend. So hopefully very hopefully he was able to at least
[03:44:57] see this. And that's a good indication. You say here when this was done he submitted awards.
[03:45:06] This is Peter's insimited awards up through CTF 116 chain of command. Braun stars for just about
[03:45:11] everyone of every member of seven Bravo a silver star for Bointen and for Gallagher an AV cross
[03:45:16] and award that he had to justify to win awards officer with multiple statements but who responded
[03:45:22] by saying that the evidence could actually support a mental of honor. I hope it does. I mean I think
[03:45:29] there would be that would be really great if this could act as something of a record for maybe
[03:45:36] an adjustment of some of these awards. We'll see. Yeah I mean right now I think we got Gallagher and Watson.
[03:45:43] But yeah and one of the great things are one of the most interesting things about that episode
[03:45:55] is the Peterson submits himself for nothing. How many officers or how many people do we work with
[03:46:01] over the course of our careers that their preoccupation was what awards they're going to get out of this.
[03:46:07] A wards are one of those funny things that they don't always necessarily say what the person
[03:46:16] deserves. They often say how good their chain of command was in recognizing what they got.
[03:46:24] A wards are crazy. A wards say as much about the person that submits them for it as it does about
[03:46:33] the person himself. I mean I had a guy I saw a guy on here Dick Thompson got gotten to a
[03:46:41] helo to like set up the spy rig or something during a bright light operation ends up the
[03:46:48] helo just takes off. He's getting ready to go and leave. He's getting ready to go and liberty. So he doesn't
[03:46:52] have his weapon. He's never gear with him and the helo takes off to go on this bright light to go
[03:46:57] and rescue down guys. They can't get in. He ends up throwing a rope out, repelling down. Grabbs
[03:47:03] the crew chiefs gone, repels down, no gloves, burns his hands, gets in there, rescues people,
[03:47:09] recovers body from two different heliocats. Completely. It's complete. Oh by the way, he dropped
[03:47:14] down the rope ended and he drops into 150 foot canopy. Just drops. Just let's go and just fall
[03:47:21] through the freaking jungle canopy to get in there. It's totally insane. He gets done with that.
[03:47:26] I mean, there's no possible way he should live number one and no way should he actually rescued
[03:47:33] guys. He lives. He rescued guys. He gets like a bronze star. He can totally insane. And you know,
[03:47:39] here's the other thing about what's what and you you lay this out very clearly. A very important
[03:47:46] thing about this seal team to seventh platoon. What really they were doing great operations but what
[03:47:52] really made it important was that they were doing these intel-driven raids, then they were gathering
[03:47:58] intelligence. They were exploiting that intelligence and they were doing follow-on raids. So this
[03:48:03] set like a standard um it's a it creates our cycle of operations and what's important about that
[03:48:11] is you know we didn't I try and tell everybody that I meet at the seal teams we didn't invent ourselves.
[03:48:18] We didn't everything good about us. We took from somebody else. If anything the seal teams are just
[03:48:25] an aggregate of all the best pieces of all these other units that have come before us. And
[03:48:30] that not just navy units either. We took the best parts of the rangers. We took the best parts of
[03:48:35] the raiders and we combined all that and when we didn't know how to do something we found the best
[03:48:40] person that teaches how to do it and they taught us how to do it and we took it. And same thing
[03:48:46] when it comes to this cycle of capture kill. I mean we sort of stumbled upon it and I think
[03:48:54] guys like Pete Peterson and Bob Gallagher who are really you know leveraging the information that
[03:49:01] they can get from other units and then aggregating that to to drive their own operations. I mean
[03:49:06] like I like Bob Wagner who's you know he is creating essentially single handedly creates the
[03:49:12] P.R.U.s. and the P.R.U. is the best part about that is the cycle of operations that they get
[03:49:19] and that the seal team sort of noticed like we can do that too. So yeah the use of interpreters
[03:49:27] the use of the locals. Yeah the use of the locals not to build a guerilla force but to just
[03:49:31] gather intelligence and go do hits. It's just I mean it's like you know it's no different than
[03:49:37] what you know the police do in every major city across the country. You arrest somebody,
[03:49:42] you shake them down for information and then you go get the next person. It's a cycle of
[03:49:46] operations that just keep perpetuating itself. So you've got incredible sections in here and again
[03:49:53] this whole book we barely even touch the surface of what you've got in this book but I want to finish
[03:49:59] off with this section here. It says this last section I'm going to read. In March of 1969 the
[03:50:11] Rand Corporation, a semi-private think tank that specialized in research and analysis for the
[03:50:16] Department of Defense published a report titled The Navy Seal Commandos, a case study of military
[03:50:25] decision making and organizational change. As far as I know the first academic level study of the seal
[03:50:32] teams. The reports author was Francis J. Bing West, a former force recon marine and Vietnam War
[03:50:41] veteran who's investigation had begun a year earlier and by the way you can read a bunch of his
[03:50:46] books right now. He wrote a bunch of other books. He wrote books about Iraq. His investigation had
[03:50:53] begun a year earlier and whose research had produced a raft of documents, dozens of interviews
[03:50:58] and the first hand observation of several seal missions into the wrongsat and the may-con delta.
[03:51:05] So he went and observed what seals were doing. Then this guy is a forced recon marine himself.
[03:51:12] From this research, West had produced an 18-page report whose introduction provided a brief
[03:51:18] description of seal training. Training he estimated at a cost of around $14,000 per man
[03:51:24] plus an overview of the seal's commitment to Vietnam at its height a commitment that never exceeded
[03:51:30] 150 seals or roughly a 100,150 fewer than the in-country height of the Green Braised Total
[03:51:38] Compliment. It was a commitment that stood out in even stark relief when placed next to the
[03:51:44] author's obvious admiration for the seal's progression from lackluster coastal raiders to the war's
[03:51:50] most aggressive direct action commando's. Admittedly, commando's who had no business becoming
[03:51:58] such and had thus drawn the interest of the same preeminent think tank that it created the U.S.
[03:52:05] military's nuclear defense strategy. Intended as a study on organizational change,
[03:52:12] the reports true purpose had been to discover how the Navy could have possibly succeeded in creating
[03:52:18] a land-focused commando force. A force that even the Viet Kong had reportedly dubbed the Men with
[03:52:25] Green Faces, a color not normally associated with the Navy's traditional medium. It was a puzzle
[03:52:32] of personal importance to the officer, to the author. As the Marine Corps, the far more likely branch
[03:52:38] of service had never succeeded in creating anything similar.
[03:52:42] Quote, how the concept was shepherded through the joint chiefs of staff and Congress,
[03:52:49] I am still trying to determine the author wrote. From the mission of the seals,
[03:52:54] exceeded the charter of the U.S. Navy. As best as he could tell, the legality of this
[03:53:01] infringement had been tolerated because of its negligible size, but later had been allowed to
[03:53:07] widen because of a series of factors, none of which at this point should be should come as a surprise.
[03:53:14] The first of these, now here you start talking about how we ended up with this with the seal
[03:53:18] teams. The first of these, at least in the May Kong Delta, submitted the author, had been the neglect
[03:53:24] of the U.S. Army in general, and the 19th-century division in particular, to push their command-o-type
[03:53:30] units to the same to quote, develop the same aggressive attitude towards ambushing that the seals had.
[03:53:37] And quote, it might further be added that neither entity had adequately prepared those command-o-type
[03:53:43] units to make such a transition in the Delta environment, acclaimed best evidenced by one attempt
[03:53:49] to conceal the river insertion of five lirps soldiers by having them copy the seal method
[03:53:55] of jumping from the back of a moving boat, but that ultimately resulted in the drowning of all five
[03:54:02] men. The second factor that accounted for this infringement, the report continued, had been the
[03:54:09] Navy senior officers, whose tours by comparison were mostly dreary affairs, a condition made
[03:54:16] more noticeable when, quote, in the presence of generals and quote, to compensate for this,
[03:54:23] the Navy's leaders had allowed the seals more latitude than they had their other units,
[03:54:29] a black market trade-off that had produced a steady supply of anecdotes for the Navy,
[03:54:34] and thereby, quote, saved the pride of the admirals. That's an interesting concept,
[03:54:40] like the the admirals wanted something to talk about. Ultimately, the author decided the most
[03:54:49] important factors factor in the seals infringement was owing to the seals themselves and the
[03:54:56] culture that weighed upon them. Dron from a notorious selective training program that produced
[03:55:02] few qualified candidates, the seals naturally had had to find a mission that kept casualties low,
[03:55:10] a circumstance that might have pushed them like the lirps or forced reconmarines into a reconnaissance
[03:55:16] role that they had anyone to pass, had they had anyone to pass intelligence on to. So you're saying
[03:55:23] there, look, if you've got a small number of people, probably one of the safest missions you can do
[03:55:30] is, hey, we're going to go into reconnaissance where we're not supposed to be seen, we're not
[03:55:33] supposed to come in contact with the enemy, and his and being west is saying here, like,
[03:55:38] they could have gone in that direction. They could have gone into this reconnaissance role,
[03:55:42] had they had anyone to pass the intelligence to. They hadn't. Nor had there been any great pressure
[03:55:49] from the river reinforced to engage in any sort of green-braised-style advisory duty or civic action.
[03:55:55] So they didn't go in that direction either. They didn't go where Yarbara went.
[03:55:58] Hey, let's go raise a bunch of local guerrillas to fight. Organizational orphans with no larger
[03:56:07] force to support or control them and possessing, quote, no love or admiration for the Vietnamese
[03:56:15] and quote, the seals that set out into the swamps not to prove themselves. They're training
[03:56:21] and already done that, said the author, but quote, because not to go, not to go, would have been
[03:56:29] inexcusable to the others. They had developed a collective value system, which emphasized
[03:56:37] physical, hardiness and courage, and they liked to fight. That's just a beautiful thing.
[03:56:46] So the seals didn't have this, you know, you might talk to an army green-braie, talking about,
[03:56:52] hey, I like my little people, you know, the, the side guys call them little people. They're,
[03:56:56] their form in relationships with the locals. This is a quote, the seals had, quote, no lover
[03:57:03] admiration for the Vietnamese and quote. That's crazy, right? And then, and then just to do that one
[03:57:10] more, to say that one more time, they weren't doing anything to prove themselves. They were doing it
[03:57:14] because, but quote, because not to go, would have been inexcusable to the others. They, they're
[03:57:23] talking about the others. Like it's inexcusable, if you don't go, you're not a seal. You're not a seal.
[03:57:27] It's inexcusable to the other seals. They had developed a collective value system, which emphasized
[03:57:34] physical, hardness and courage, and they liked to fight and quote. So when the tactics of patrol
[03:57:41] and ambush had proved unproductive, nobody, not a seal, meaning no blue water superior officer
[03:57:50] had ordered them to try something else. They had just done it. It was an exceptional adaptation.
[03:57:59] The Marine veteran author made a special note to point out that his fellow Marines had failed to
[03:58:04] mimic and by following the previous logic, for reasons that blamed them for this, a sequence of
[03:58:11] attribution and blame that if the preceding pages have proved anything was not a sufficient explanation.
[03:58:17] quote, what strikes me as most remarkable about the seal story, the author concluded,
[03:58:26] is their performance and their ability to learn and adapt in a decentralized sub-optimizing
[03:58:33] environment.
[03:58:34] quote, though all true and commendable, it was also an explanation that it considered only the
[03:58:42] record that came after 1966. Missing was any analysis that proved deeper than that top layer of
[03:58:49] history whose soil had fertilized this inland evolution. The armies and Marine Corps preceding
[03:58:56] 30 years of whip-sawing interest in raids and raiders and the Navy's perennial preoccupation
[03:59:02] with justifying its worth in offensive combat, a preoccupation that had combined with the Navy's
[03:59:08] traditional latitude and the UDD's traditional adaptability to create what several unidentified
[03:59:15] seals soon described to a documentary filmmaker as the wars unsung soldier.
[03:59:22] And quote, what we consider without question the best troops that the country has.
[03:59:28] And quote, both descriptions notable because they didn't use the word sailors.
[03:59:34] And just short of the readers, I just a praisel that had dubbed them the wars quote,
[03:59:41] super-commandos by the end, these would be assessments that were next to impossible to dispute.
[03:59:55] You're kind of a end on being West report. That was one of the first things I found. I found
[04:00:03] that at the UDTC, all these games, archives. When I started this book, I was one of the first places
[04:00:08] I went to do research. And the archives at the UDTC, all these amir, little disorganized.
[04:00:14] And some cases that provides opportunities that you didn't expect. And one of those was
[04:00:20] Bing West report. And I had found it. I read it when I got it, but I hadn't thought about it.
[04:00:26] It provided enough food for thought that it just stuck in the back of my head,
[04:00:33] stuck in the back of my head for at least eight years. And so when I was nearing the end of the
[04:00:39] book and I was trying to find a way to kind of summarize everything that had happened.
[04:00:44] It suddenly dawned on me. I'll go back to that report. And I knew that it had been written by
[04:00:49] Francis J West. I didn't know it was Bing West. It was like, oh my gosh, it's Bing West.
[04:00:55] Like, and I've read, you know, books by Bing West. And not like that, but in a way that, you know,
[04:01:00] it made this thing even more like just strange that it happened. But on one of the last
[04:01:07] ops that we did in Alambar Province, we had gotten my platoon had been ambushed on a rooftop
[04:01:17] sniper overwatch. And one of our, one of our seals, Mark Robbins, I'm going shot through the
[04:01:23] head, took a bullet of 762, round from a peak cam through the right eye and exit at the back of his head.
[04:01:30] And we were cut off from support. We couldn't get any, I was trying to get aircraft down to
[04:01:34] support us. They wouldn't come. They wouldn't come because there were so much, you know, machine gunfire.
[04:01:40] And we were trying to, or I get the other seal element to fight to our position. And they were,
[04:01:47] they just were, they were on foot and trying to get there as quickly as possible. So at one point,
[04:01:52] I asked for a, you know, a Marine QRF. And the Marine QRF was separated from us at the fob by this road
[04:02:00] that we, we called IED Ali. We'd never known a vehicle to drive on this road. Had not gotten IED.
[04:02:08] And one officer, who was there a major, he jumps in a homebie, grabs another homebie, and they
[04:02:15] start trucking down the road to get to our position. They get to us. They provide cover for the
[04:02:20] helicopter to get in. And we, a mark actually, you know, it walks himself to the helicopter,
[04:02:27] remarkably, he's still around. He's a Lake County cop now. Yeah.
[04:02:33] But what makes this, you know, story of more remarkable is that the Marine major, who came to our
[04:02:39] rescue, was Owen West. Thing was, as soon as you started to tell about you exactly where the story
[04:02:44] was going. Like this has to be all west. This has to be big. I was just incredible. Like the, and,
[04:02:50] and, and, being was, you know, the fact that being wrote this report, being had this interaction
[04:02:56] with the seal teams in 1968 and the rights of this report in 1969. Super humble report, too.
[04:03:04] It's incredibly, super generous. And I mean, you have so many opportunities to, you know, draw
[04:03:09] attention to other things and he does it. I mean, he's, he's truly impressed by this organization. What,
[04:03:14] you know, we, you know, as a, as a, as a, as an institution have not done, which I think we should
[04:03:22] do at every opportunity is recognize the, uh, the influence of all of these other units had on our
[04:03:28] creation, you know, soldiers, Marines, Rangers, uh, recon, everybody. They all contributed to who we are.
[04:03:35] And, some sense, our history, I think it's, I mean, especially if you frame it in this way,
[04:03:42] it's not our history. It is our history, but it's a lens that you can use to, to look at the entire
[04:03:48] history of American special operations from World War II to Vietnam. We wouldn't be here without them,
[04:03:55] and in some ways, they would not have changed into the units, so they wouldn't have permanently
[04:04:00] created these units. Had we not set an example for them to also follow? Yeah, I mean, it's, um,
[04:04:08] and, and, you know, the, the thing with being Western, just that humble report that you can, you can,
[04:04:16] I mean, the Marine Corps is just so professional. It's so many ways. It reminds me of Dave Burkou,
[04:04:20] was a top gun pilot, F-18 pilot, Marine Corps, fighter pilot, um, ended up being the
[04:04:27] senior instructor at Top Gun, um, F-35 pilot, F-22, because it's the total stud, um, and he worked
[04:04:34] well as he was a fact with us on the ground, the battle or body, which really interesting is, you know,
[04:04:38] he came from Top Gun, he was the senior instructor at Top Gun. I mean, you're not, you're not going
[04:04:44] to get any more professional of a human being as a Marine, that is the senior instructor at Top Gun.
[04:04:51] And I was talking to him about when he came to one of our briefs, for the first time,
[04:04:54] this is where in the battle of the body, we're doing a brief to some kind of an operation.
[04:04:58] And he was just telling me right away, he was just so impressed with what, with just how the
[04:05:05] brief was. Just how the brief was, you know, this is young Lieutenant Lave Babin and Chief Tony
[04:05:10] of Fraddy, getting up there and talking about what we're going to do, me, given the commanders
[04:05:13] and tent, and like, I remember him telling me that, this was 10 years later, he probably told me that.
[04:05:18] And just that humility to think, oh, these guys are doing something that is square to
[04:05:26] away. And for being to be able to recognize that and write that while the war is still going on,
[04:05:35] that's pretty impressive. And you know, you say that he didn't really probe deeper than the
[04:05:40] layer of history that's prior to 1966, but I'll tell you what, that left plenty of room for you to
[04:05:45] do just that with this book. And this book, which provides so much history, so much information.
[04:05:56] Thank you. And you know, one thing that is awesome about the Marine Corps,
[04:06:00] and I've talked about this on this podcast before, I actually talk a lot about it with clients,
[04:06:04] because the Marine Corps has an incredibly powerful culture.
[04:06:08] I think it might be the strongest culture in the world. Absolutely. I couldn't agree more.
[04:06:14] Yeah, I've said it, you know, time and time again, like, pound for pound, there is no
[04:06:21] institution like the US Marine Corps. There are ability to, they require much more from
[04:06:30] everybody, from their troops than every other branch of service. The trade off, though,
[04:06:36] with that by requiring as much is a level of responsibility that nobody else gets in the military.
[04:06:43] And the result is its initiative and courage. And that initiative encourages part of,
[04:06:50] it's part of their culture. And if you, you know, I, I thought about this for years as I was doing
[04:06:55] this podcast and interviewing people, and what the Marine Corps has is this culture that is rooted
[04:07:02] in the stories of their history. And I think that what you've done with this book
[04:07:09] will strengthen the history of the frogmen and the seal teams. And it'll anchor our culture
[04:07:15] to a past that is filled with these qualities that we want, these qualities of bravery and heroism
[04:07:23] and adaptation and evolution and pride from our successes and humility from our failures. And I
[04:07:31] think this book connects us with the individuals who paved the way for us that we are lucky enough
[04:07:39] to be associated with and lucky enough, really to call our brothers and make this incredible
[04:07:45] group of individuals that we call the teams. And it's an outstanding book. And I think you've done
[04:07:53] a real service to the community by writing this book. And anybody, if you're in the seal teams,
[04:07:59] absolutely just order this book immediately, there's an audio book version which is outstanding as well,
[04:08:05] get this book, anybody that has any interest in any military history in the history of all
[04:08:12] special operations just get this book. There's so much information in it. It's, it's
[04:08:18] immaculately researched. And I just, I couldn't be, I couldn't be more impressed with the man.
[04:08:23] And I'm, look, I feel, I feel somewhat bad because I write books basically from my own head.
[04:08:32] It feels like I have a much easier task than you do. I don't have to read anything. I just
[04:08:38] write what I already know or what I live through. And for you to dive so deep into this, it's just
[04:08:43] outstanding. And I think it's, it's a huge, a huge, a huge service to the teams, man. Thank you.
[04:08:52] So thanks, Ben. Echo Charles, you got anything? Well, I think we covered it.
[04:08:59] Good to see you. Thank you. Nice to see you, yeah. Yeah, that's right.
[04:09:03] Hey, Ben, where can we find you? I know you got it. You got a Twitter, right? Is that,
[04:09:07] is that, is that you much your, your social media extent? I have a Twitter and an Instagram.
[04:09:11] I probably should create a Facebook because I think there's, you know, a few older people that
[04:09:16] would like us. What's your, what's your, I know your Twitter is Ben H. Milligan, right?
[04:09:21] What's your, what's your gram? I'm noted. So please bear with me. I'm, I'm getting better.
[04:09:29] Be Milligan 3. Be Milligan 3. Yeah. Be Milligan. Then I got 3. I've got 3 little boys. So that's, uh,
[04:09:36] okay. Yeah. And, um, do you have a website or anything? I love how I find it. I mean, I mean, I'm not, I'm just like,
[04:09:46] I'm in the most incapable of personal medical and social media promotion. But I always say as
[04:09:51] a same personality traits that make it possible to write this book or the same personality traits,
[04:09:56] make it hard to promote it. So I, um, I'm doing the best I can't, I, I, I appreciate you bringing
[04:10:01] me on here. Uh, the, uh, yeah, I couldn't have done this without lots of people helping out and
[04:10:07] including everybody that, you know, came together to, you know, get this album with Craven, um,
[04:10:11] you know, to, to get that, that blur from him and then, um, you know, I just couldn't have written it
[04:10:17] without just, uh, uh, uh, you know, the supportive, all the people around me, including the,
[04:10:23] the three little guys that I wrote this for. So, you're well, hey, man. Once again, thanks for your,
[04:10:30] thanks for your service and the Navy. Great. Thanks for your service and the teams. Thanks for doing
[04:10:34] what you did, um, and, and really truly, honestly, man. I can't thank you enough for writing this book,
[04:10:42] and it's, it's just, it's just an outstanding document. I hope everybody gets it so much to learn
[04:10:47] and so much respect to be paid to the forefathers that brought us to where we are today.
[04:10:52] Thanks for shining a light on them for us. Thank you. And with that Ben Milligan has left the building,
[04:11:03] uh, echo Charles. Yes, sir. Need to uphold the legacy of the teams by getting better. What
[04:11:11] you got for us first off, first off, I'll side note, me and Ben have history, um, one of the first
[04:11:16] people that I met in San Diego and I moved to, you know, because of a connection between kick
[04:11:24] through, yep, through, uh, my Hawaii people, you know, that came to me to eventually become seals,
[04:11:30] he's well, first of all, he didn't remember you though. Well, the here's the thing we both,
[04:11:34] we both, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, zero is inaccurate, zero is inaccurate. He was like,
[04:11:39] looking at me, I was like, maybe a little something, then later on the break, yeah, we reconnected.
[04:11:44] Yeah, once you described exactly this situation, because he didn't remember you.
[04:11:48] Either way, we're all trying to get better, which is weird. You know, when someone's got such an
[04:11:52] eye for detail, yes, he doesn't remember you at all. That's got to hurt a little bit. Yes,
[04:11:57] especially all the research he's done and all the stuff that his brain is like capable of
[04:12:02] literally even make mustard in the way. Oh, yeah, mustard. Thank you. Either way, we've connected
[04:12:11] now, we're pretty much boys again, so it's all good. And you know, we are trying to get better as
[04:12:15] you mentioned. So boom, we're over here, we're working out, we're working out, we're reading,
[04:12:19] not as much as Ben, but we are most of us, not as much of that, but we're trying
[04:12:24] to stay cognitively and physically in the game and improving ourselves slowly, quickly, whatever.
[04:12:29] So I'm saying through this journey, we need supplementation. Good news, chocolate supplements.
[04:12:36] Call of Jacofuel. First one I'm talking about is the energy drink, new paradigm.
[04:12:41] I said it paradigm, new era of energy drinks. No longer are we burdened, burdened
[04:12:49] with the poisons and the aftermath and the price of bad energy drinks. It's all good. All good.
[04:12:57] Taste good. Give you the little boost we need and healthy for you. Has the electrolytes too,
[04:13:04] by the way, which is that everything electrolytes? Sometimes you need them. Yeah, well, no,
[04:13:09] not to have them, is it thing? Yes, but I don't know if other energy drinks have the electrolytes.
[04:13:13] The thing is, they don't fit because there's too much poison in the now. The one's,
[04:13:16] yeah, sure. Here's the interesting thing. You look at the way the seal teams
[04:13:20] came to fruition, right? There was a gap, there's gaps and some people enter the gap
[04:13:26] but then they leave it, right? I do that. But the seal teams are just there. The UDT's are just
[04:13:30] there. We're staying with it. That's sort of like this whole situation we're finding ourselves in.
[04:13:36] Because there is little gap. Oh, no, everyone wants to make poison because it sells, put a bunch of
[04:13:40] sugar in it, put a bunch of caffeine in it and just give people poison that don't care.
[04:13:45] That's the gap. The gap is like, hey, people might actually want something that's healthy.
[04:13:50] And so I've seen now that we win in the gap, there's other people that are trying to get in there,
[04:13:54] but they don't believe in it. So as soon as they realize how expensive it is, how hard it is to
[04:14:00] produce, as soon as they realize that they just leave the gap. So we're just there, solo operation.
[04:14:04] It's cruising in the sand and tall like the damn seal teams. This is the freaking seal teams of
[04:14:10] drinks right here. Dr. Disco-go. That's what's happening. Oh, yeah, delivering. And that's the thing,
[04:14:16] and you know what? I can't be publishing the mission at all costs. I'm not telling anyone to be offended.
[04:14:21] I'm not saying that. In fact, I would never say that. I'm not telling people to be angry.
[04:14:26] I'll never say that. I can't, I can't impose outrage on somebody. That being said,
[04:14:33] those other entities that created these old school, old era, energy drinks.
[04:14:41] They're kind of playing on your weekend. They're taking us for fools. They're taking advantage.
[04:14:44] They're like, hey, hey, this is taking this tastes real good. You know, the guy in the alley,
[04:14:48] you know, with the red eyes or whatever. It's just because, yeah, hey, take the bro at taste.
[04:14:53] Good, taste good. It's good. It's a nice little boost. Meanwhile, you're like cool. You buy it.
[04:14:57] You drink it. You enjoy the whatever you enjoy. And then later on a one, that guy's long gone.
[04:15:03] You over here paying the price. And it's not even like a lot of your friends.
[04:15:06] Okay. I think did less healthy all this stuff. This and here comes Joko.

[04:18:45] that. And this is this is what I've leaned toward the whole time is shirts that are kind of
[04:18:50] tied to the podcast. And this is one of them right here. The C wolves. 1966 and 1972. By the way,
[04:18:56] commissioned in combat, decommissioned in combat. That's the C wolves. You heard about them today.
[04:19:02] If they will go and get the seals out of the worst possible situation, gunfire. Don't care.
[04:19:08] So how do you get that shirt? Sure. Walker. Yes sir. The one of the
[04:19:12] omages to the seawalls. Yeah, very much. Oh, you can get this at the shirtlocker on Jockel store.
[04:19:20] So yeah, you sign up for the shirtlock and you get a cool shirt. Cool.
[04:19:24] It's hard for me to explain how cool it is. Very young levels of creativity.
[04:19:29] Either way, it's cool shirt. You get one every month free shipping on that one as well. This is just one of them.
[04:19:34] I got a new feature that we're working on. It should be done. It should be done within the next. I don't know.
[04:19:39] But if you remember the shirtlocker, hey, you look, you missed the shirt. Last month, five months ago,
[04:19:45] whatever. You have the option to get it. If you remember. Oh, you work that on that one.
[04:19:51] The last yes. Very nice. This is the shirt. I'm glad you like it. Jockel seems, you know,
[04:19:55] people seem to like the designs overall. You know, they just want to go and play. Yeah.
[04:19:58] I get a bet. People like that one. A lot. I like that one a lot. Well, because I'm a
[04:20:04] supporter of the C wolves. It's more ample C wolves. Hey, subscribe also to this podcast. We also have
[04:20:09] some other podcasts unraveling that I do with my brother DC Darrell Cooper. We got the grounded
[04:20:15] podcast. We got the warrior kid podcast. We also have Jockel underground.com, which we release a little
[04:20:24] what's it called, a little alternative podcast, a little complimentary podcast where we talk about some
[04:20:29] other adjacent items and that we do some Q and A. And the reason we have that is in case
[04:20:37] these platforms, which we do not control, which we don't like. We want to be in control.
[04:20:43] So that we can deliver. And if people start inserting advertisements into this podcast,
[04:20:49] we know you don't want that. We don't want it. We'd rather have you listen to a 74 minute
[04:20:54] advertisement at the end where echo Charles is talking. Hey, $8.18 a month if you want to help us out
[04:21:01] with the Jockel underground.com. If you can't afford it, no factor. We, we, we're in this together.
[04:21:07] Email assistance at jockel underground.com. Plus, have a YouTube channel. Subscribe to that. We make
[04:21:12] awesome videos where I am the assistant director. And really the driving sort of creative force
[04:21:18] behind the awesomeness of most of the videos and then echo does some editing for it. Thank you.
[04:21:25] You're doing great work. Thank you. Or do you say also? Or do you say cool channel YouTube channel?
[04:21:31] Oh yeah, fully. Yeah, that's a good one. If you're interested in an American company,
[04:21:36] they're up to downs, challenges, successes. Yeah, that's a really good one.
[04:21:40] The whole idea. No, also psychological warfare. What that is is an album with Jockel tracks on it.
[04:21:46] Tracks on the album of Jockel talking, getting us through our moments of weakness, which we may
[04:21:51] or may not have. You know, you can get that anywhere where you can get MP3's psychological warfare.
[04:21:58] Good on. If you want something to hang on your wall, which you probably do, you don't just want
[04:22:03] to have walls that are just playing a black YouTube. Well, I guess I do, but if I didn't,
[04:22:09] then I would go to flipsidecampus.com. And I would get some cool stuff from my brother Dakota Meyer

[04:23:08] don't have that that that sort of sunk and look on your face. You want to say, I'm in the game.
[04:23:14] Hey, we have a little connection. You got that first edition. We have a little connection.
[04:23:19] I'm not saying don't talk to me if you have a second edition. It's okay. Look, I have an open
[04:23:25] mind. But if you want to be want to have that immediate connection, let's get that going.
[04:23:31] Leadership Strategy and Tech is field manual. The code evaluation of protocols,
[04:23:36] discipline, equals freedom field manual. Way the warrior kid 1, 2, 3, and 4. My king, the dragons.

[04:23:51] about it. I didn't even mention this. He's got it in here. What hack worth. Hack worth was
[04:23:56] running the tiger force. I can't believe I didn't bring that up. I'm sorry, Ben. I missed the.

[04:24:14] come about? How did they do? Why did they get turned off? There's a whole story behind it.

[04:26:10] 3. There you go. M-I-L-L-I-G-A-N. Again, thanks once again to Ben for your service and the
[04:26:20] neighbor, your service and the teams and now your incredible service to the teams. By writing
[04:26:26] this incredible book that will solidify our roots, our culture and our history. Can't thank
[04:26:31] you enough and to all the military personnel out there on the front lines right now. Thank you
[04:26:37] for defending our freedom and our way of life and to police and law enforcement firefighters,
[04:26:41] paramedics and EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers, board of patrol secret service and all
[04:26:46] first responders. Thanks for keeping us safe here at home. And everyone else out there. How about
[04:26:54] we all take a little lesson from these frog men? How about we develop and embrace a collective
[04:27:02] value system that emphasizes physical, hardiness and courage and attitude that can press on through
[04:27:09] pain and suffering, a humble intellect that can adapt and overcome a discipline that's unbreakable
[04:27:16] and an unwavering commitment to accomplish the mission. That is the way of the frog men.
[04:27:25] And that is an ideal example to follow and the one that I wake up and face every day.
[04:27:35] To hold the line. And until next time, the Zekko and Joko out.
