00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.24
This is Jockel Podcast number 124.

2
00:00:04.24 --> 00:00:07.28
With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willick.

3
00:00:07.28 --> 00:00:08.60
Good evening, Echo.

4
00:00:08.60 --> 00:00:09.60
Good evening.

5
00:00:11.60 --> 00:00:17.36
Bullets punched through the chopper as Nevanide jumped out.

6
00:00:17.36 --> 00:00:24.64
Together, we ran over to the farthest wounded guy, grabbed him, ran back and tossed him into the bird.

7
00:00:24.64 --> 00:00:29.20
We picked up a second wounded in action the same way, and then a third.

8
00:00:29.20 --> 00:00:33.68
Amazingly, without becoming casualties ourselves.

9
00:00:33.68 --> 00:00:39.48
But by the time everyone was loaded onto the helicopter, there was no room inside for me.

10
00:00:39.48 --> 00:00:44.64
I stood on the skids and put on my helmet so I could tell the pilot to take off.

11
00:00:44.64 --> 00:00:46.80
But I found I couldn't talk.

12
00:00:46.80 --> 00:00:54.20
I was so dried out, my tongue had welded itself to the roof of my mouth out of pure fear.

13
00:00:54.20 --> 00:00:58.52
I had to open my canteen and drink some water before I could even gasp.

14
00:00:58.52 --> 00:01:02.56
Let's get this mother out of here.

15
00:01:02.56 --> 00:01:06.92
We took the wounded back to base and returned to the flight.

16
00:01:06.92 --> 00:01:12.64
Without anything holding him up now, I couldn't figure out why Torpy didn't do something

17
00:01:12.64 --> 00:01:18.000
about getting his men consolidated outside of that patty.

18
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.04
He still kept saying he was pinned down.

19
00:01:20.04 --> 00:01:22.44
Finally, I lost my temper.

20
00:01:22.44 --> 00:01:26.96
I really chewed his ass over the radio, demanding he get cracking and get those men out

21
00:01:26.96 --> 00:01:28.96
of that patty now.

22
00:01:28.96 --> 00:01:37.92
Apparently the next thing he did was put down the radio, stand straight up and begin running

23
00:01:37.92 --> 00:01:43.20
from man to man to get them to move back.

24
00:01:43.20 --> 00:01:50.08
He got mode down right away and died a short time later.

25
00:01:50.08 --> 00:01:54.92
Maybe I hadn't learned a damn thing at my con.

26
00:01:54.92 --> 00:01:59.88
Or from Dennis Foley's near miss in that mine field.

27
00:01:59.88 --> 00:02:02.28
I hadn't asked Torpy to stand up.

28
00:02:02.28 --> 00:02:09.80
He didn't need to in order to extricate himself, but it hadn't occurred to me that he would.

29
00:02:09.80 --> 00:02:14.68
I had been playing the game as if Lieutenant Nap, a lat natural more seasoned leader was

30
00:02:14.68 --> 00:02:17.44
in charge.

31
00:02:17.44 --> 00:02:24.84
It was due to the force of my word as his commander that this inexperienced young lieutenant

32
00:02:24.84 --> 00:02:30.36
was sent to his death, like Jim Gardner's.

33
00:02:30.36 --> 00:02:42.84
Torpy's death was a big guilt thing for me and has remained so all my life.

34
00:02:42.84 --> 00:02:52.16
And that is an excerpt from the book about face, which is by Colonel David Hackworth,

35
00:02:52.16 --> 00:02:54.40
the book that we covered on this podcast.

36
00:02:54.40 --> 00:03:02.12
In fact, it was the first book we covered on this podcast and there is a reason for that.

37
00:03:02.12 --> 00:03:09.08
The book about face was and is my favorite book.

38
00:03:09.08 --> 00:03:17.44
And when I was deployed to a modian 2006, I read it and re-read it every chance I got.

39
00:03:17.44 --> 00:03:25.72
Now, the book is about war, but I have always found it to be a book about leadership

40
00:03:25.72 --> 00:03:32.24
and in my opinion, the best book I have ever read about leadership.

41
00:03:32.24 --> 00:03:36.84
David Hackworth was born and raised in California, lied about his age and joined the

42
00:03:36.84 --> 00:03:42.76
Marcha Marines and served in the South Pacific in the end of World War II.

43
00:03:42.76 --> 00:03:47.32
And then he joined the army where he rose through the ranks, serving in the Korean war

44
00:03:47.32 --> 00:03:53.000
and the Vietnam War, battlefield commissioned.

45
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.96
Novers' career in combat, he was awarded to Distinguished Service Crosses 8 Silver Stars,

46
00:03:57.96 --> 00:04:07.52
three legions of merit, a distinguished fine cross, and eight purple hearts.

47
00:04:07.52 --> 00:04:17.12
And in the end, he became an outspoken opponent of how we were fighting the war in Vietnam

48
00:04:17.12 --> 00:04:22.64
and that costume his career in the army.

49
00:04:22.64 --> 00:04:28.04
He went on to write these books and was able to pass on the lessons that he learned

50
00:04:28.04 --> 00:04:33.08
through these books about face, which as I said, we covered on podcast number two.

51
00:04:33.08 --> 00:04:42.08
We also wrote a book called The Steel My Soldiers Heart, which is covered on podcast 28.

52
00:04:42.08 --> 00:04:54.20
And unfortunately he died on May 4th, 2005, before I ever got the chance to meet him.

53
00:04:54.20 --> 00:05:00.72
But a few months ago someone reached out to me on social media, someone by the name

54
00:05:00.72 --> 00:05:04.28
of Jay Mukayama.

55
00:05:04.28 --> 00:05:08.92
And he was a listener to the podcast and he thought I might be interested in talking

56
00:05:08.92 --> 00:05:12.96
to his father, James Mukayama.

57
00:05:12.96 --> 00:05:15.16
The name looked pretty familiar.

58
00:05:15.16 --> 00:05:21.08
I thought I recognized it and I quickly realized that this was the full name of one of

59
00:05:21.08 --> 00:05:27.76
the men that appeared in both books about face and steel my soldiers heart.

60
00:05:27.76 --> 00:05:32.72
The man Colonel Hacworth simply called Muk.

61
00:05:32.72 --> 00:05:39.44
And I replied to Jay and said I would be absolutely honored to be introduced to his father

62
00:05:39.44 --> 00:05:46.84
who was in fact, Major General James Mukayama, a retired army officer that had served as

63
00:05:46.84 --> 00:05:54.12
a company commander in Vietnam working directly for Colonel Hacworth.

64
00:05:54.12 --> 00:06:04.56
After some logistical coordination, it is my absolute honor to welcome General James Mukayama

65
00:06:04.56 --> 00:06:06.56
to the podcast.

66
00:06:06.56 --> 00:06:09.56
Sir, this is an absolute honor.

67
00:06:09.56 --> 00:06:14.08
Well, Jocco, it is the same on this side.

68
00:06:14.08 --> 00:06:20.56
I've listened to some of your podcasts, especially the one on steel my soldiers hearts.

69
00:06:20.56 --> 00:06:23.24
And I couldn't stop listening to it.

70
00:06:23.24 --> 00:06:29.24
And then I realized I looked at my watch and I said, this is over two hours already.

71
00:06:29.24 --> 00:06:39.24
Just because of the way you picked out the really important things that Hacworth, in fact,

72
00:06:39.24 --> 00:06:47.24
I forgot a lot of the things until you read verbatim, some of the things that he said.

73
00:06:47.24 --> 00:06:48.92
And he lived what he wrote.

74
00:06:48.92 --> 00:06:50.92
I might add.

75
00:06:50.92 --> 00:06:53.20
He loved by example.

76
00:06:53.20 --> 00:06:58.12
Well, I definitely have taken a ton of lessons from him over the years and that's why it's

77
00:06:58.12 --> 00:07:00.92
just amazing to be sitting here with you.

78
00:07:00.92 --> 00:07:02.16
And let's talk about you though.

79
00:07:02.16 --> 00:07:06.88
Let's talk about how you ended up in the army and where you came from and what your background

80
00:07:06.88 --> 00:07:07.88
was.

81
00:07:07.88 --> 00:07:10.20
You know, once you take us back to Chicago.

82
00:07:10.20 --> 00:07:12.20
Sure.

83
00:07:12.20 --> 00:07:18.52
I was born and raised in the inner city of Chicago, a neighborhood called Logan Square, primarily

84
00:07:18.52 --> 00:07:21.20
Polish German Italian.

85
00:07:21.20 --> 00:07:25.16
We were the only minority family in that neighborhood.

86
00:07:25.16 --> 00:07:31.44
We went to a grammar school of 900, my brother and I were the only minorities.

87
00:07:31.44 --> 00:07:37.20
So I grew up basically in a phenomenally white white environment.

88
00:07:37.20 --> 00:07:43.000
But I never felt like I was different really because everybody treated me fun.

89
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.88
It was a time in life in the inner city where everybody knew each other.

90
00:07:47.88 --> 00:07:51.88
On our neighborhood, our block, we didn't lock our doors.

91
00:07:51.88 --> 00:07:58.56
Everybody knew that's a time when most mothers stayed at home.

92
00:07:58.56 --> 00:08:01.88
And they were the police of the block.

93
00:08:01.88 --> 00:08:05.80
Everybody would come by the was out of order.

94
00:08:05.80 --> 00:08:06.80
They would take care of it.

95
00:08:06.80 --> 00:08:12.76
But we were, I'd say, lower middle class economically.

96
00:08:12.76 --> 00:08:14.40
We never owned a home.

97
00:08:14.40 --> 00:08:17.56
We always lived in an apartment building.

98
00:08:17.56 --> 00:08:20.88
My father was an immigrant from Japan.

99
00:08:20.88 --> 00:08:24.28
My mother was her family from Japan.

100
00:08:24.28 --> 00:08:28.16
But she was actually born in Madison, Wisconsin.

101
00:08:28.16 --> 00:08:31.000
And so my grandparents lived with us.

102
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.28
We all three generations in the same apartment.

103
00:08:36.28 --> 00:08:38.56
I never felt poor.

104
00:08:38.56 --> 00:08:42.48
Because we had a strong family.

105
00:08:42.48 --> 00:08:47.08
Our church was only three blocks away from our apartment building.

106
00:08:47.08 --> 00:08:50.44
Every Sunday, we put on our Sunday best clothes.

107
00:08:50.44 --> 00:08:53.52
And we would walk as a family to church.

108
00:08:53.52 --> 00:08:54.80
Now it's interesting.

109
00:08:54.80 --> 00:08:56.92
You said your dad had immigrated from Japan.

110
00:08:56.92 --> 00:08:59.96
And your mom was born in Wisconsin.

111
00:08:59.96 --> 00:09:04.80
Was your mom not, didn't your mom get put in the internment camps with her family during World War II?

112
00:09:04.80 --> 00:09:05.80
No, no, no.

113
00:09:05.80 --> 00:09:07.40
Here's the thing.

114
00:09:07.40 --> 00:09:10.60
My father came to the states in 1918.

115
00:09:10.60 --> 00:09:13.20
In fact, that was kind of a funny thing.

116
00:09:13.20 --> 00:09:18.56
He was going to sign up for World War I, which was still going on.

117
00:09:18.56 --> 00:09:20.000
But then it ended.

118
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.56
So he couldn't sign up.

119
00:09:23.56 --> 00:09:26.92
And then when World War II hit, he was too old.

120
00:09:26.92 --> 00:09:29.32
And plus he was a Japanese.

121
00:09:29.32 --> 00:09:30.96
I don't know if you know this or not.

122
00:09:30.96 --> 00:09:33.64
Japanese could not become citizens.

123
00:09:33.64 --> 00:09:39.64
Naturalized citizens, that would be United States until 1952.

124
00:09:39.64 --> 00:09:46.48
And so he was still a Japanese citizen.

125
00:09:46.48 --> 00:09:47.84
But he was in Chicago.

126
00:09:47.84 --> 00:09:49.64
My family was in Chicago.

127
00:09:49.64 --> 00:09:51.88
My mother and father, my brother.

128
00:09:51.88 --> 00:09:55.16
I wasn't born, I was born during World War II.

129
00:09:55.16 --> 00:09:59.16
And so we didn't have to go to camp.

130
00:09:59.16 --> 00:10:06.92
Mostly, the 95% of Japanese Americans at that time, or anyone of Japanese descent, lived

131
00:10:06.92 --> 00:10:13.52
on the West Coast in California, Oregon, Washington State, Colorado.

132
00:10:13.52 --> 00:10:20.94
And so when the war hit, Pearl Harbor hit, President Roosevelt signed executive order

133
00:10:20.94 --> 00:10:29.92
906-6, which called for the all people of Japanese descent to be evacuated from the West

134
00:10:29.92 --> 00:10:35.88
Coast and put in concentration camps in the inner part of the country.

135
00:10:35.88 --> 00:10:39.48
Basically, in deserted desert areas.

136
00:10:39.48 --> 00:10:45.76
And these camps, they, you, for, basically, refer to them as relocation centers.

137
00:10:45.76 --> 00:10:50.44
But they were really, my, you know, your standard concentration camp with Bob Boyre

138
00:10:50.44 --> 00:10:55.28
Offences, with machine guns facing in, not out.

139
00:10:55.28 --> 00:10:58.80
And people not being able to come and go as they placed.

140
00:10:58.80 --> 00:11:04.48
130,000 people of Japanese descent were put in these camps.

141
00:11:04.48 --> 00:11:10.16
The two thirds of them were American citizens, not aliens.

142
00:11:10.16 --> 00:11:11.16
Okay.

143
00:11:11.16 --> 00:11:20.56
And no trials, no, no, the only crime that they committed was the, the color of their skin

144
00:11:20.56 --> 00:11:24.16
and their fact that they were of Japanese descent.

145
00:11:24.16 --> 00:11:28.000
And so did your family avoid that because they were in Chicago?

146
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.08
Yeah, but they were only like three or four hundred of us in Chicago at the time.

147
00:11:33.08 --> 00:11:38.96
And we weren't considered a threat, but my other, the rest of my family, my grandparents,

148
00:11:38.96 --> 00:11:45.80
my mother's side and my cousins and aunts and uncles, they were all in California.

149
00:11:45.80 --> 00:11:48.04
And they all got evacuated.

150
00:11:48.04 --> 00:11:53.24
Just imagine this, you're, it's a Friday night and you got a knock on your door.

151
00:11:53.24 --> 00:11:54.24
Okay.

152
00:11:54.24 --> 00:11:56.40
It's the local FBI agent.

153
00:11:56.40 --> 00:12:02.76
And he says, on Monday morning, be at the corner of Washington and State Street,

154
00:12:02.76 --> 00:12:07.20
with two suitcases and the communication.

155
00:12:07.20 --> 00:12:08.40
Okay.

156
00:12:08.40 --> 00:12:11.60
And you, you know, you don't have time to do hardly anything.

157
00:12:11.60 --> 00:12:16.28
And you, you know, you go there and then you're put on a train.

158
00:12:16.28 --> 00:12:18.68
You don't know where you're going.

159
00:12:18.68 --> 00:12:22.48
And you wind up in the camp and you're there for three years.

160
00:12:22.48 --> 00:12:23.48
Okay.

161
00:12:23.48 --> 00:12:27.04
So, let's say you're your owner of a small business.

162
00:12:27.04 --> 00:12:29.48
You lose the business.

163
00:12:29.48 --> 00:12:31.52
You no longer have a job, right?

164
00:12:31.52 --> 00:12:37.40
So you can't pay your mortgage and things like they lost, they lost everything.

165
00:12:37.40 --> 00:12:40.12
And now you're 18, let's say you're 18 years old.

166
00:12:40.12 --> 00:12:41.12
Okay.

167
00:12:41.12 --> 00:12:42.96
And this happens to your family, right?

168
00:12:42.96 --> 00:12:47.80
And the local Army recruiter comes to the camp and says, I want you to go down if you're

169
00:12:47.80 --> 00:12:49.44
a country.

170
00:12:49.44 --> 00:12:53.28
You know, frankly, Jocco, I don't know what I would have done.

171
00:12:53.28 --> 00:12:57.28
I might have told the guy to take a walk, you know, or you use other words.

172
00:12:57.28 --> 00:12:59.88
And yet, it's so many of them joined up.

173
00:12:59.88 --> 00:13:00.88
Absolutely.

174
00:13:00.88 --> 00:13:03.72
So, the 100th Patan in the 442nd.

175
00:13:03.72 --> 00:13:04.72
Regimental Conventing.

176
00:13:04.72 --> 00:13:05.72
That's right.

177
00:13:05.72 --> 00:13:12.04
And those guys fought with incredible bravery and had some critical battles that turned

178
00:13:12.04 --> 00:13:15.000
some, the tied and some critical situations as well.

179
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.84
Yeah, they were the most highly decorated infantry unit in the history of the United States

180
00:13:19.84 --> 00:13:23.20
Army for its size and time of service.

181
00:13:23.20 --> 00:13:25.36
And they were a regimental combat team.

182
00:13:25.36 --> 00:13:30.28
Let's say about 4,500 soldiers because they had a, and are totally battalion and

183
00:13:30.28 --> 00:13:32.28
other things they were attached.

184
00:13:32.28 --> 00:13:33.28
Okay?

185
00:13:33.28 --> 00:13:39.80
In about 18 months of combat, they were awarded over 9,000 purple hearts.

186
00:13:39.80 --> 00:13:44.56
Some guys had 3 or 4, you know, and if not more.

187
00:13:44.56 --> 00:13:50.000
And, you know, the presidential unit citation, you're familiar with that award.

188
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.60
There are Army divisions that never got that award.

189
00:13:53.60 --> 00:13:54.60
Okay?

190
00:13:54.60 --> 00:13:59.40
That regimental combat team was awarded 8 presidential unit citations.

191
00:13:59.40 --> 00:14:00.40
That's unbelievable.

192
00:14:00.40 --> 00:14:02.48
Yeah, they were my personal heroes.

193
00:14:02.48 --> 00:14:05.80
So that's, and that was to kind of get back to your question.

194
00:14:05.80 --> 00:14:11.52
That was one of the reasons that I wanted to join you Army.

195
00:14:11.52 --> 00:14:13.20
I was actually going to ask that.

196
00:14:13.20 --> 00:14:15.96
So, you know, you're sitting here saying, if you were in one of those camps, you don't

197
00:14:15.96 --> 00:14:18.40
know if you might have to tell them to go take a walk.

198
00:14:18.40 --> 00:14:23.44
But when your time came, you walked into the recruiters office.

199
00:14:23.44 --> 00:14:24.44
Not away from it.

200
00:14:24.44 --> 00:14:25.44
Yeah.

201
00:14:25.44 --> 00:14:29.36
Well, in my case, when I was in a country, I was in a country.

202
00:14:29.36 --> 00:14:36.48
In high school, as I told you, you know, a faith is a very strong part of my whole life.

203
00:14:36.48 --> 00:14:42.84
I've been so blessed in life, beyond anything I deserve.

204
00:14:42.84 --> 00:14:46.92
And so when I was our church, you know, we go to church every Sunday.

205
00:14:46.92 --> 00:14:48.52
I was in the choir.

206
00:14:48.52 --> 00:14:50.16
I was in cup scouts.

207
00:14:50.16 --> 00:14:52.12
I was in boy scouts.

208
00:14:52.12 --> 00:14:53.12
I was in the youth group.

209
00:14:53.12 --> 00:14:56.68
You know, all of this was centered around the church.

210
00:14:56.68 --> 00:14:59.32
You know, when I was in scouts, I went to the National Jam.

211
00:14:59.32 --> 00:15:05.60
I was in the library in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania with 52,000 of my best friends living

212
00:15:05.60 --> 00:15:07.88
in tents.

213
00:15:07.88 --> 00:15:12.60
But you know, that was, and what was the symbol of that jambri.

214
00:15:12.60 --> 00:15:17.44
George Washington at Valley Forge, kneeling in prayer.

215
00:15:17.44 --> 00:15:20.92
And the motto of scouting is for God and country.

216
00:15:20.92 --> 00:15:22.64
So that was really my motto.

217
00:15:22.64 --> 00:15:24.64
And then I was in a boy state.

218
00:15:24.64 --> 00:15:26.24
Are you familiar with boy state?

219
00:15:26.24 --> 00:15:27.24
No.

220
00:15:27.24 --> 00:15:30.48
The state is an American Legion program.

221
00:15:30.48 --> 00:15:31.48
Does it still exist?

222
00:15:31.48 --> 00:15:32.48
Yes.

223
00:15:32.48 --> 00:15:33.48
Yes.

224
00:15:33.48 --> 00:15:36.000
And it's been around probably for 50 years.

225
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.16
Now, when I went, it was the 2050.

226
00:15:38.16 --> 00:15:39.16
Okay.

227
00:15:39.16 --> 00:15:40.72
So it's more than 50 years.

228
00:15:40.72 --> 00:15:45.76
And the concept of the boy state is they take junior, high school juniors, ready to go

229
00:15:45.76 --> 00:15:48.12
into senior year.

230
00:15:48.12 --> 00:15:52.32
And who are leaders, basically.

231
00:15:52.32 --> 00:15:57.36
And they form a quasi state government for two weeks.

232
00:15:57.36 --> 00:16:00.16
And they actually divide into two political parties.

233
00:16:00.16 --> 00:16:01.56
They don't call them Republicans.

234
00:16:01.56 --> 00:16:03.56
They request they call them something else.

235
00:16:03.56 --> 00:16:11.56
And they have state government, county government, and local city government.

236
00:16:11.56 --> 00:16:13.28
And you run for offices.

237
00:16:13.28 --> 00:16:18.32
And you actually have to come up with a platform and you debate.

238
00:16:18.32 --> 00:16:22.56
And so it's a lessen in civics.

239
00:16:22.56 --> 00:16:25.000
But it was sponsored by the American Legion.

240
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.32
So we all lived in like dorms.

241
00:16:27.32 --> 00:16:29.76
And the dorms, we had to make our beds.

242
00:16:29.76 --> 00:16:32.08
So you could bounce a quarter on it.

243
00:16:32.08 --> 00:16:35.08
They were all army blankets, stuff, and cats.

244
00:16:35.08 --> 00:16:36.08
But it was wonderful.

245
00:16:36.08 --> 00:16:39.80
It was just a great experience.

246
00:16:39.80 --> 00:16:45.88
So when I was in high school, I was very active in my church.

247
00:16:45.88 --> 00:16:48.60
I'm kind of a German guy.

248
00:16:48.60 --> 00:16:54.16
And I was a president of my high school youth group at the church.

249
00:16:54.16 --> 00:16:58.36
And then I became the vice president of the Chicago Association.

250
00:16:58.36 --> 00:17:00.36
Did you play sports?

251
00:17:00.36 --> 00:17:01.36
No.

252
00:17:01.36 --> 00:17:02.36
Well, I was, no, I didn't.

253
00:17:02.36 --> 00:17:03.36
I was.

254
00:17:03.36 --> 00:17:05.16
And what about your grades?

255
00:17:05.16 --> 00:17:06.16
I was, I was Bell.

256
00:17:06.16 --> 00:17:07.16
I was too.

257
00:17:07.16 --> 00:17:10.12
It was my, of my grandma school and high school.

258
00:17:10.12 --> 00:17:11.12
And I was.

259
00:17:11.12 --> 00:17:12.44
They have valedictory and grammar school?

260
00:17:12.44 --> 00:17:13.44
Yeah.

261
00:17:13.44 --> 00:17:15.16
That shows you where how well I did in grammar school.

262
00:17:15.16 --> 00:17:16.68
I didn't even know that.

263
00:17:16.68 --> 00:17:19.48
And then I, I, I was in the band.

264
00:17:19.48 --> 00:17:21.56
I played clarinet and saxophone.

265
00:17:21.56 --> 00:17:23.88
So I was the first chair clarinet of the band.

266
00:17:23.88 --> 00:17:27.92
That was the principal woodwind in New Yorkous Dron.

267
00:17:27.92 --> 00:17:32.44
And so, but anyway, I was very active in my church youth group.

268
00:17:32.44 --> 00:17:35.28
And I was thinking of becoming a minister.

269
00:17:35.28 --> 00:17:36.44
Okay.

270
00:17:36.44 --> 00:17:39.44
But then I was in junior ROTC.

271
00:17:39.44 --> 00:17:44.04
And Chicago has the nation's largest junior ROTC program.

272
00:17:44.04 --> 00:17:46.44
About 30 high schools have it.

273
00:17:46.44 --> 00:17:48.44
And it's a great program.

274
00:17:48.44 --> 00:17:50.92
People misunderstand JROTC.

275
00:17:50.92 --> 00:17:53.04
They think it's a feeder for the military.

276
00:17:53.04 --> 00:17:54.04
Okay.

277
00:17:54.04 --> 00:17:56.60
I mean, some of them do go into the military.

278
00:17:56.60 --> 00:17:58.20
But that's not the purpose.

279
00:17:58.20 --> 00:18:05.84
The purpose is to give these high school students something other than gangs to belong to,

280
00:18:05.84 --> 00:18:12.16
to give them experience and leadership and discipline and teamwork.

281
00:18:12.16 --> 00:18:14.20
And it's a tremendous program.

282
00:18:14.20 --> 00:18:16.24
So I was in junior ROTC.

283
00:18:16.24 --> 00:18:24.28
Was, so it's that combined with your view of the, like the 442.

284
00:18:24.28 --> 00:18:30.28
Those things are kind of starting to congeal in your head and maybe move you towards a military.

285
00:18:30.28 --> 00:18:31.28
Yeah.

286
00:18:31.28 --> 00:18:35.40
And then in addition to that, I have just one sibling in older brother.

287
00:18:35.40 --> 00:18:37.72
He's about seven years older than I am.

288
00:18:37.72 --> 00:18:41.56
And he joined the army as an enlisted guy.

289
00:18:41.56 --> 00:18:48.24
But in the first year of college, he was in a military fraternity called Pershing Rifles,

290
00:18:48.24 --> 00:18:53.40
which other people like Colin Powell and some others have been in, including myself.

291
00:18:53.40 --> 00:18:56.96
When I went to the U of I.

292
00:18:56.96 --> 00:19:01.44
And you have to understand also that I'm Japanese American.

293
00:19:01.44 --> 00:19:09.04
In the Japanese culture, the warrior, the samurai, is at the top of the social strata.

294
00:19:09.04 --> 00:19:15.40
Unlike China, where the scholar was at the top in Japan, it's the warrior.

295
00:19:15.40 --> 00:19:22.40
So when I joined the military, when I became a commission officer, my dad was so proud,

296
00:19:22.40 --> 00:19:26.72
his small t-shirts swallowed the large.

297
00:19:26.72 --> 00:19:33.68
And when I became a general, it's like incredible.

298
00:19:33.68 --> 00:19:39.000
But I, so I want to do ROTC in college as a country.

299
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.24
Yes, oh yes, I'm a driven guy, right?

300
00:19:43.24 --> 00:19:49.08
And I was, here's the thing though, as I told you, I was thinking becoming a minister.

301
00:19:49.08 --> 00:19:52.80
But then I also wanted to serve in the military.

302
00:19:52.80 --> 00:19:54.36
So what do you think I would do?

303
00:19:54.36 --> 00:19:55.36
Jappin?

304
00:19:55.36 --> 00:19:56.36
Jappin.

305
00:19:56.36 --> 00:19:58.000
It's a little problem.

306
00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.60
I'm Protestant.

307
00:19:59.60 --> 00:20:08.60
And my denomination, theologically, went so far away from what I believed in, that I couldn't

308
00:20:08.60 --> 00:20:10.32
buy the theology.

309
00:20:10.32 --> 00:20:12.48
So now I'm praying to God, right?

310
00:20:12.48 --> 00:20:17.76
And I'm saying, I get the message, I guess you want me to do my military thing.

311
00:20:17.76 --> 00:20:19.16
So that's what I did.

312
00:20:19.16 --> 00:20:20.16
Okay?

313
00:20:20.16 --> 00:20:23.52
But you fast forward, 50 years, 55 years.

314
00:20:23.52 --> 00:20:25.16
What am I doing today?

315
00:20:25.16 --> 00:20:29.000
I'm doing what I wanted to do when I was in high school, because I have military outreach

316
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.96
USA, faith, faith, non-profit that I started.

317
00:20:32.96 --> 00:20:35.36
So it's a lesson in prayer.

318
00:20:35.36 --> 00:20:39.92
And that is, at that time, I thought God was telling me no.

319
00:20:39.92 --> 00:20:42.04
He wasn't telling me no.

320
00:20:42.04 --> 00:20:45.04
He was saying, wait, it's on my schedule.

321
00:20:45.04 --> 00:20:46.04
Not on your schedule.

322
00:20:46.04 --> 00:20:52.28
I mean, you know, I wasn't mature enough either as a military guy, nor as in my faith.

323
00:20:52.28 --> 00:20:56.44
So what year was it that you're showing up in college?

324
00:20:56.44 --> 00:20:57.44
61.

325
00:20:57.44 --> 00:20:58.44
61 started.

326
00:20:58.44 --> 00:21:01.60
So you do four years of college, it's 1965.

327
00:21:01.60 --> 00:21:02.60
Right.

328
00:21:02.60 --> 00:21:07.08
And I'm as really not escalated yet at that point.

329
00:21:07.08 --> 00:21:09.72
But did you think it was pretty hot at that time?

330
00:21:09.72 --> 00:21:15.96
And I basically, by that time, I was on the military thing, right?

331
00:21:15.96 --> 00:21:17.72
I wasn't going to be a champion anymore.

332
00:21:17.72 --> 00:21:20.36
So I was, I was in Persian rifles.

333
00:21:20.36 --> 00:21:22.000
I was on the rifle team.

334
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.80
I was on the drill team.

335
00:21:23.80 --> 00:21:26.36
You know, if it smelled military, I was in.

336
00:21:26.36 --> 00:21:27.36
Okay?

337
00:21:27.36 --> 00:21:30.96
And then you have to remember, I had four years of high school, ROTC.

338
00:21:30.96 --> 00:21:32.56
Also before I went to Bennings.

339
00:21:32.56 --> 00:21:34.20
You're pretty good at your drill.

340
00:21:34.20 --> 00:21:35.20
I take it.

341
00:21:35.20 --> 00:21:36.20
I had.

342
00:21:36.20 --> 00:21:41.20
I mean, infantry, I OBC, infantry officers, basic course, peace of cave.

343
00:21:41.20 --> 00:21:42.96
I mean, I went through that.

344
00:21:42.96 --> 00:21:45.04
I was an honor graduate, my class.

345
00:21:45.04 --> 00:21:46.72
And in fact, this is really funny.

346
00:21:46.72 --> 00:21:51.20
My class, about 200 brand new, second lieutenant's, right?

347
00:21:51.20 --> 00:21:57.52
About a third of it was a national guard, about a third were reserves.

348
00:21:57.52 --> 00:21:59.88
And there were only a few of us that were regular Army.

349
00:21:59.88 --> 00:22:05.88
You see, I got a distinguished military graduate commission, regular Army infantry, right?

350
00:22:05.88 --> 00:22:09.12
And so very few of us were regular Army in my class.

351
00:22:09.12 --> 00:22:11.40
So our attitude was not really the best.

352
00:22:11.40 --> 00:22:12.40
Shall we say?

353
00:22:12.40 --> 00:22:15.16
And so we get the Benny.

354
00:22:15.16 --> 00:22:17.64
And they marched us to class.

355
00:22:17.64 --> 00:22:20.48
I mean, this was in, to us it was insane.

356
00:22:20.48 --> 00:22:22.04
We're second lieutenant's.

357
00:22:22.04 --> 00:22:23.48
This tell us where the building is.

358
00:22:23.48 --> 00:22:24.48
We'll get there, right?

359
00:22:24.48 --> 00:22:26.80
No, we had the march in formation.

360
00:22:26.80 --> 00:22:27.80
The army.

361
00:22:27.80 --> 00:22:32.92
So needless to say, the attitude was not real good with my company.

362
00:22:32.92 --> 00:22:39.44
So the day we graduated, they used to have a award, a streamer, that companies could put

363
00:22:39.44 --> 00:22:40.84
on their guide on.

364
00:22:40.84 --> 00:22:43.36
Those called the Tiger Tactics Award.

365
00:22:43.36 --> 00:22:49.88
This was really gung-ho companies, which ours was not needless to say.

366
00:22:49.88 --> 00:22:53.84
Well, the night before we stole or fumbling on their company.

367
00:22:53.84 --> 00:22:57.28
We put it on our guide on, so I'm graduation day.

368
00:22:57.28 --> 00:22:59.08
We march by the headquarters.

369
00:22:59.08 --> 00:23:01.68
And outcomes the commander, the guys live it.

370
00:23:01.68 --> 00:23:03.88
And you say, where do you guys get that?

371
00:23:03.88 --> 00:23:08.000
Oh, you know, it's just just a period.

372
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And we were graduating.

373
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.40
That was the guy going to do to us, right?

374
00:23:10.40 --> 00:23:13.84
So we all graduated and that was it.

375
00:23:13.84 --> 00:23:19.88
So 1965, then you went to graduate school.

376
00:23:19.88 --> 00:23:23.52
Yeah, here's the thing.

377
00:23:23.52 --> 00:23:28.76
You know, I told you, we didn't have a lot of money for me to go to college.

378
00:23:28.76 --> 00:23:31.88
So I knew I had to earn it myself, right?

379
00:23:31.88 --> 00:23:38.52
So when I was in high school, on my senior year, I worked 33 hours a week.

380
00:23:38.52 --> 00:23:43.60
I worked from five till 10 o'clock at night at a warehouse in Chicago.

381
00:23:43.60 --> 00:23:46.000
And I worked eight hours on Saturday.

382
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.24
So I could raise money.

383
00:23:47.24 --> 00:23:48.84
Okay, I also played in two bands.

384
00:23:48.84 --> 00:23:51.40
I told you I played for an atoness saxophone.

385
00:23:51.40 --> 00:23:55.08
I played in a Polish band for weddings.

386
00:23:55.08 --> 00:23:58.96
And that was so cool because by the third set, everybody was so blasted.

387
00:23:58.96 --> 00:23:59.96
Nobody cared.

388
00:23:59.96 --> 00:24:00.96
Right.

389
00:24:00.96 --> 00:24:03.44
And then by also played in a Jewish band.

390
00:24:03.44 --> 00:24:05.40
So I used to play for Barnetsvys.

391
00:24:05.40 --> 00:24:07.76
So I knew all the temples in Chicago.

392
00:24:07.76 --> 00:24:09.76
So I used to tell people, I had them coming.

393
00:24:09.76 --> 00:24:11.76
You're the way.

394
00:24:11.76 --> 00:24:14.60
And then I had to, you know, I took out two government loans.

395
00:24:14.60 --> 00:24:18.04
And that's the only way I could afford to go to school.

396
00:24:18.04 --> 00:24:20.12
And so 65 rules around.

397
00:24:20.12 --> 00:24:21.12
I graduated.

398
00:24:21.12 --> 00:24:25.84
And I find this interesting for a real obvious reason.

399
00:24:25.84 --> 00:24:28.44
You majored in English in college.

400
00:24:28.44 --> 00:24:31.92
Yeah, the reason I did that, Choco, was once again,

401
00:24:31.92 --> 00:24:37.44
you know, I'm pretty focused guy in my focus was on becoming

402
00:24:37.44 --> 00:24:40.96
the best officer I could be, the best leader I could be

403
00:24:40.96 --> 00:24:42.88
of infantry soldiers.

404
00:24:42.88 --> 00:24:45.32
And I knew I was going into combat, right?

405
00:24:45.32 --> 00:24:48.24
So as a freshman, I tried to determine,

406
00:24:48.24 --> 00:24:51.76
what am I going to major into preparing me for that.

407
00:24:51.76 --> 00:24:57.000
So I looked at psychology and I looked at English, not rhetoric,

408
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.36
but English literature.

409
00:24:59.36 --> 00:25:01.80
I rejected psychology in my first year,

410
00:25:01.80 --> 00:25:06.52
because we had these classes with Pavlov and his dogs

411
00:25:06.52 --> 00:25:07.96
and all this stuff.

412
00:25:07.96 --> 00:25:09.52
And I was going through that and I said,

413
00:25:09.52 --> 00:25:11.92
what does this have to do with people?

414
00:25:11.92 --> 00:25:15.24
You know, I mean, I want to learn how to work with people.

415
00:25:15.24 --> 00:25:17.80
Well, literature, whether you read

416
00:25:17.80 --> 00:25:21.56
the whole continuum of every man or Shakespeare

417
00:25:21.56 --> 00:25:25.20
or Hemingway, if you read that stuff,

418
00:25:25.20 --> 00:25:29.72
there are universal traits of human nature that come out at you.

419
00:25:29.72 --> 00:25:32.68
And if you can understand it, you can realize

420
00:25:32.68 --> 00:25:34.40
what motivates people.

421
00:25:34.40 --> 00:25:36.44
Okay, so I, and then not only that,

422
00:25:36.44 --> 00:25:40.12
but if you read the best writers of all time,

423
00:25:40.12 --> 00:25:42.48
I just felt by sure us Moses,

424
00:25:42.48 --> 00:25:46.24
God, not the smartest guy, just by sure us Moses,

425
00:25:46.24 --> 00:25:49.48
I could absorb that and I could express myself better.

426
00:25:49.48 --> 00:25:51.28
So that's why I made you an English.

427
00:25:51.28 --> 00:25:52.36
And I've talked about that.

428
00:25:52.36 --> 00:25:53.68
I was an English major as well.

429
00:25:53.68 --> 00:25:57.04
And I was, I was, I was prior and listed.

430
00:25:57.04 --> 00:26:00.08
So I had been in for eight years and actually

431
00:26:00.08 --> 00:26:03.52
I'd been in for 10 years by the time I went to college

432
00:26:03.52 --> 00:26:06.000
and I knew right away I was going to be an English major

433
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.24
and the reason I wanted to be an English major,

434
00:26:07.24 --> 00:26:09.88
because I had gotten commissioned and served two years

435
00:26:09.88 --> 00:26:13.80
in the in the seals before I went to college as an officer.

436
00:26:13.80 --> 00:26:15.68
And I realized you got to write everything.

437
00:26:15.68 --> 00:26:17.64
You got to read directives from people

438
00:26:17.64 --> 00:26:18.92
and you got to understand what they're saying.

439
00:26:18.92 --> 00:26:20.80
And then you got to communicate with your troops.

440
00:26:20.80 --> 00:26:23.60
And I wanted to do have a good command of the English language.

441
00:26:23.60 --> 00:26:25.80
The, the part that you talked about,

442
00:26:25.80 --> 00:26:27.64
the understanding of human nature was something

443
00:26:27.64 --> 00:26:30.28
that I saw once I got in and I started reading it.

444
00:26:30.28 --> 00:26:32.80
I started applying and thinking about what I was reading.

445
00:26:32.80 --> 00:26:34.52
And now this is something that I,

446
00:26:34.52 --> 00:26:36.60
that I advocate for everyone.

447
00:26:36.60 --> 00:26:38.84
To, if you want to really understand human nature,

448
00:26:38.84 --> 00:26:39.84
you got to read.

449
00:26:39.84 --> 00:26:41.08
Yeah, yeah.

450
00:26:41.08 --> 00:26:43.16
So I was, so when I was reading.

451
00:26:43.16 --> 00:26:45.16
What is your reading?

452
00:26:45.16 --> 00:26:48.04
You know, when I said that in 1965,

453
00:26:48.04 --> 00:26:50.12
the war, because I, what was it?

454
00:26:50.12 --> 00:26:51.40
What year was I drank?

455
00:26:51.40 --> 00:26:53.28
That was 1965, wasn't it?

456
00:26:53.28 --> 00:26:54.56
The battle of I drink.

457
00:26:56.16 --> 00:26:57.72
I think it was.

458
00:26:57.72 --> 00:27:00.68
I think it was 1965.

459
00:27:00.68 --> 00:27:01.52
I think it was.

460
00:27:01.52 --> 00:27:03.56
And you know, they kind of used that as,

461
00:27:03.56 --> 00:27:06.96
hey, this is when the real escalation started.

462
00:27:06.96 --> 00:27:09.24
And the reason I asked you that specifically is,

463
00:27:09.24 --> 00:27:12.56
because I've had some Vietnam vets on that were going to college in 1965.

464
00:27:12.56 --> 00:27:13.72
And they were like, they didn't even,

465
00:27:13.72 --> 00:27:14.88
hadn't even heard of Vietnam.

466
00:27:14.88 --> 00:27:15.72
At that point.

467
00:27:15.72 --> 00:27:19.12
So I guess it was because I was in ROTC,

468
00:27:19.12 --> 00:27:21.56
you know, I was kind of paying more attention.

469
00:27:21.56 --> 00:27:22.40
Yeah.

470
00:27:22.40 --> 00:27:24.12
And I knew I was going to the Benny.

471
00:27:24.12 --> 00:27:26.12
I mean, that was, four gone conclusion.

472
00:27:26.12 --> 00:27:27.72
And you knew you were going to combat as well.

473
00:27:27.72 --> 00:27:28.56
Oh yeah.

474
00:27:28.56 --> 00:27:29.40
That was your mind.

475
00:27:29.40 --> 00:27:31.04
Yeah, because that was my goal.

476
00:27:31.04 --> 00:27:33.000
Being infantry officers.

477
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.80
You know, I mean, if I did, you know,

478
00:27:34.80 --> 00:27:38.84
that's, that to me was where I wanted to go.

479
00:27:38.84 --> 00:27:44.48
And so in 65, I got an offer to get an assistantship,

480
00:27:45.68 --> 00:27:50.16
you know, to be really a counselor in the dorm.

481
00:27:50.16 --> 00:27:51.84
But it's like I died and went to heaven

482
00:27:51.84 --> 00:27:55.40
because they paid for tuition and fees.

483
00:27:55.40 --> 00:27:57.72
And I got like a hundred bucks a month salary.

484
00:27:57.72 --> 00:27:58.96
Which to me was like,

485
00:27:58.96 --> 00:27:59.96
British guy in the world.

486
00:27:59.96 --> 00:28:00.96
Yeah, you know.

487
00:28:00.96 --> 00:28:04.68
But the important thing was I could get my master's degree.

488
00:28:04.68 --> 00:28:06.96
Okay. And by the way, I got it in a year.

489
00:28:06.96 --> 00:28:08.24
Because I went to summer school.

490
00:28:08.24 --> 00:28:10.20
And I just, I'm on the go on active duty.

491
00:28:10.20 --> 00:28:13.76
But this was a chance for me to go, you know,

492
00:28:13.76 --> 00:28:16.64
under the citizenship and not have to pay for it.

493
00:28:16.64 --> 00:28:19.80
But now the pragmatism kicks in for me.

494
00:28:19.80 --> 00:28:21.60
You know, because, you know, really with the name

495
00:28:21.60 --> 00:28:25.80
which degree, as you know, you know, it's great for preparing

496
00:28:25.80 --> 00:28:28.64
you to understand things.

497
00:28:28.64 --> 00:28:32.68
But, you know, that in 50 cents in those days

498
00:28:32.68 --> 00:28:34.28
will get me a cup of coffee.

499
00:28:34.28 --> 00:28:38.20
So I, and that, I knew I was going to go into combat.

500
00:28:38.20 --> 00:28:40.16
I knew I was going to be an infantry officer.

501
00:28:40.16 --> 00:28:44.92
And the odds of my perhaps getting wounded, you know,

502
00:28:44.92 --> 00:28:46.36
were fairly decent.

503
00:28:46.36 --> 00:28:49.12
So I needed to have a fallback, you know.

504
00:28:49.12 --> 00:28:50.36
And I wasn't in a count.

505
00:28:50.36 --> 00:28:53.60
And so I wasn't a CPA or, you know, something like that.

506
00:28:53.60 --> 00:28:57.000
So I got my masters in the teaching of social studies.

507
00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.44
So I could be a teacher.

508
00:28:58.44 --> 00:29:00.68
And, you know, you don't have to run the hundred yard dash

509
00:29:00.68 --> 00:29:01.88
to be a teacher.

510
00:29:01.88 --> 00:29:04.72
And so, and I, and teaching is a noble profession.

511
00:29:04.72 --> 00:29:09.28
And I always felt that, you know, it's something I could do

512
00:29:09.28 --> 00:29:13.36
if I got wounded and still contribute to society.

513
00:29:13.36 --> 00:29:16.92
And 70, or, you know, the 75% of your time

514
00:29:16.92 --> 00:29:20.88
is an officer or senior NCO is teaching.

515
00:29:20.88 --> 00:29:22.92
You know, so I figured I want to find out how to

516
00:29:22.92 --> 00:29:25.24
pro-stue it, allegedly.

517
00:29:25.24 --> 00:29:28.12
What I found out is the military has the best education

518
00:29:28.12 --> 00:29:30.08
system really does.

519
00:29:30.08 --> 00:29:33.48
You know, I didn't have to get my masters at green and history

520
00:29:33.48 --> 00:29:37.56
and philosophy of education at psych and all that stuff.

521
00:29:37.56 --> 00:29:39.28
No, didn't need it.

522
00:29:39.28 --> 00:29:42.44
So you wrap up, you get your masters degree.

523
00:29:42.44 --> 00:29:44.56
And now you know you're going to Vietnam.

524
00:29:44.56 --> 00:29:46.56
What happens is that when you graduate?

525
00:29:46.56 --> 00:29:48.60
Okay, so I go to Fort Bunny.

526
00:29:48.60 --> 00:29:49.80
I go to I OBC.

527
00:29:49.80 --> 00:29:51.68
I'm, you know, I'm an honor graduate with my class.

528
00:29:51.68 --> 00:29:53.44
So I didn't finish that story.

529
00:29:53.44 --> 00:29:57.56
This might, my, my class that I was in, you know, really bad

530
00:29:57.56 --> 00:29:59.36
attitude guys, right?

531
00:29:59.36 --> 00:30:03.04
And the day of graduation, they announced the honor graduates.

532
00:30:03.04 --> 00:30:04.84
Okay, I was in the third platoon.

533
00:30:04.84 --> 00:30:08.96
So first platoon, they announced the honor graduates in the platoon.

534
00:30:08.96 --> 00:30:12.32
Second platoon, they announced the honor graduates third platoon,

535
00:30:12.32 --> 00:30:14.32
which I am in.

536
00:30:14.32 --> 00:30:17.84
I'm the only guy who's an honor graduate out of my platoon.

537
00:30:17.84 --> 00:30:21.04
When they announced my name, everybody boo.

538
00:30:21.04 --> 00:30:24.88
Because I ruin our record right?

539
00:30:24.88 --> 00:30:28.48
So what happened is I volunteered for, I volunteered for,

540
00:30:28.48 --> 00:30:30.56
well, I was regular army.

541
00:30:30.56 --> 00:30:32.56
So I had to go airborne.

542
00:30:32.56 --> 00:30:36.64
I volunteered for Ranger school, but in those days, the West Pointers,

543
00:30:36.64 --> 00:30:39.96
all of those mandatory, they had to go to Ranger school.

544
00:30:39.96 --> 00:30:43.76
So I graduated the same time that the West Pointers did.

545
00:30:43.76 --> 00:30:45.72
They took up all the quotas.

546
00:30:45.72 --> 00:30:48.000
So I, I didn't, I couldn't get into Ranger school,

547
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.12
but I had a solution.

548
00:30:49.12 --> 00:30:51.64
See, I'm always thinking, I was gonna,

549
00:30:51.64 --> 00:30:54.28
I applied for Pathfinder school.

550
00:30:54.28 --> 00:30:56.72
So I figured I'd go through Pathfinder school.

551
00:30:56.72 --> 00:30:58.28
I'd finish that.

552
00:30:58.28 --> 00:30:59.68
The West Pointers would be gone.

553
00:30:59.68 --> 00:31:02.52
I could slide into the next Ranger class, right?

554
00:31:02.52 --> 00:31:04.48
They didn't give me Pathfinder.

555
00:31:04.48 --> 00:31:05.72
So now I'm stuck, right?

556
00:31:05.72 --> 00:31:09.16
So I said, okay, I'm volunteering for Vietnam.

557
00:31:09.16 --> 00:31:11.60
And they sent me to Korea.

558
00:31:11.60 --> 00:31:15.04
So I was in the DMZ in Korea, which is really a god thing.

559
00:31:15.04 --> 00:31:18.68
I've gotta tell you this, because I was with the second ID

560
00:31:18.68 --> 00:31:21.64
on the DMZ and those days, you were assigned,

561
00:31:21.64 --> 00:31:24.32
and you stayed there for 13 months on the DMZ.

562
00:31:24.32 --> 00:31:27.80
And there was still active combat patrolling in...

563
00:31:27.80 --> 00:31:28.64
Oh, yeah.

564
00:31:28.64 --> 00:31:30.40
We'd take casualties during that time period.

565
00:31:30.40 --> 00:31:32.20
13 months, I was there.

566
00:31:32.20 --> 00:31:35.40
We had 12KIA in about 40 wounded.

567
00:31:35.40 --> 00:31:38.52
Okay, so this was not a walk in the park.

568
00:31:38.52 --> 00:31:41.48
And it was a great experience for me,

569
00:31:41.48 --> 00:31:44.72
because in addition to, see, we were in the DMZ.

570
00:31:44.72 --> 00:31:48.56
We actually had a company compound, okay?

571
00:31:48.56 --> 00:31:51.92
And we actually had a guard mount, you know,

572
00:31:51.92 --> 00:31:54.48
and we had our own NCO club and we had,

573
00:31:54.48 --> 00:31:58.84
and so we had all the BS of the admin stuff

574
00:31:58.84 --> 00:32:01.20
that you do when you're in Gerson.

575
00:32:01.20 --> 00:32:05.000
But we were doing combat patrolling every day on the DMZ.

576
00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.76
So it was really a great experience for me as a young officer,

577
00:32:09.76 --> 00:32:13.56
because I was able to lead troops out on patrol.

578
00:32:13.56 --> 00:32:18.84
But also I had to do all this admin stuff, you know, the Gerson.

579
00:32:18.84 --> 00:32:21.24
And so that was your Patoon Commander tour.

580
00:32:21.24 --> 00:32:23.80
What were the patrols like? What were you doing?

581
00:32:23.80 --> 00:32:26.24
Basically, they were ambush patrols,

582
00:32:26.24 --> 00:32:29.000
because the DMZ was set up

583
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.36
where it was a free fire zone.

584
00:32:32.36 --> 00:32:34.40
If you saw anyone, you could shoot them,

585
00:32:34.40 --> 00:32:37.40
because nobody was supposed to be there, okay?

586
00:32:37.40 --> 00:32:40.68
And we would have to say Korean Chongqing,

587
00:32:40.68 --> 00:32:43.56
which is telling the stop, you know,

588
00:32:43.56 --> 00:32:46.72
but how many times did you say that before you pulled the trigger?

589
00:32:46.72 --> 00:32:51.08
Basically, but we did ambush patroling primarily.

590
00:32:51.08 --> 00:32:54.16
And that was, you said you were lucky,

591
00:32:54.16 --> 00:32:56.08
or you said it was God that put you there.

592
00:32:56.08 --> 00:33:02.44
And you feel that because that's just a really good sort of warm-up for combat.

593
00:33:02.44 --> 00:33:04.24
Absolutely. That's absolutely.

594
00:33:04.24 --> 00:33:09.44
I feel that way. My first deployment to Iraq was relatively.

595
00:33:09.44 --> 00:33:11.60
It was relatively easy, right?

596
00:33:11.60 --> 00:33:15.000
We were in a bad dad. Things were going pretty well.

597
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.84
We had the upper hand on the enemy,

598
00:33:16.84 --> 00:33:21.04
and we didn't get into too much major combat.

599
00:33:21.04 --> 00:33:22.68
You know, we got a few fire fights here and there,

600
00:33:22.68 --> 00:33:25.48
but wasn't like when I got from body.

601
00:33:25.48 --> 00:33:30.12
I felt like that, I was real blessed to have had an experience

602
00:33:30.12 --> 00:33:34.28
where you get the kind of the initial nervousness out of your system

603
00:33:34.28 --> 00:33:35.88
and you realize, okay, I can do this.

604
00:33:35.88 --> 00:33:38.12
That was, I felt pretty lucky about that.

605
00:33:38.12 --> 00:33:41.72
Well, also, you know, keeping mine up is just a young,

606
00:33:41.72 --> 00:33:44.92
second-leaf ton of shaved tail, what did I know? Really.

607
00:33:44.92 --> 00:33:48.52
And I was once again blessed, I had a platoon sergeant

608
00:33:48.52 --> 00:33:51.32
who really, even as a Korean war veteran.

609
00:33:51.32 --> 00:33:51.96
Oh, wow.

610
00:33:51.96 --> 00:33:54.44
You know, God was actually in E7, okay?

611
00:33:54.44 --> 00:33:57.48
And basically, when I got there, you know,

612
00:33:57.48 --> 00:33:59.88
I was his lieutenant.

613
00:33:59.88 --> 00:34:02.28
Okay, so nobody screwed around with me,

614
00:34:02.28 --> 00:34:03.96
but on the other hand, I listened.

615
00:34:03.96 --> 00:34:05.48
We all carefully.

616
00:34:05.48 --> 00:34:07.88
That's one thing I learned.

617
00:34:07.88 --> 00:34:10.52
You know, as a young officer,

618
00:34:10.52 --> 00:34:14.92
I've had my success in the military

619
00:34:14.92 --> 00:34:19.000
because I had great NCOs who made me look good.

620
00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.08
And I had commanders who mentored me

621
00:34:21.08 --> 00:34:23.16
and didn't cut my head off when I screwed up.

622
00:34:23.16 --> 00:34:25.24
And I made my first share of mistakes.

623
00:34:25.24 --> 00:34:28.60
Yeah, but we all, you get done with that tour.

624
00:34:28.60 --> 00:34:30.44
And then what's your next assignment?

625
00:34:30.44 --> 00:34:33.80
So, you know, you get your dream sheet, right?

626
00:34:33.80 --> 00:34:35.80
A lot of where you want to go when you do a row,

627
00:34:35.80 --> 00:34:37.64
so when you leave that area.

628
00:34:37.64 --> 00:34:41.000
And so I put in for Fort Brake, for Fort Benning,

629
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.52
because I'm on the go to a narrow point unit,

630
00:34:42.52 --> 00:34:45.80
because I was airborne, but I had never served in a narrow point unit, right?

631
00:34:45.80 --> 00:34:47.40
They sent me to Fort Lewis Washington.

632
00:34:47.40 --> 00:34:53.96
So I go to Fort Lewis Washington to the training center,

633
00:34:53.96 --> 00:34:56.60
infantry training center, okay?

634
00:34:56.60 --> 00:35:01.16
And when I get there, I made a long story short

635
00:35:01.16 --> 00:35:03.000
when I was in Korea.

636
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.84
I also was, they found out I had a master's degree,

637
00:35:06.84 --> 00:35:09.08
so they pulled me off the line.

638
00:35:09.08 --> 00:35:12.92
And the battalion commander calls me into his office, right?

639
00:35:12.92 --> 00:35:15.64
So I go down there and he says,

640
00:35:15.64 --> 00:35:17.80
do you tell them what we are going to do?

641
00:35:17.80 --> 00:35:19.000
How are you doing?

642
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.56
Sir, I'm having a great time.

643
00:35:21.56 --> 00:35:27.32
I'm with soldiers, we're doing combat patrol lane.

644
00:35:27.32 --> 00:35:32.04
And I really, and this is what I've been trained to do.

645
00:35:32.04 --> 00:35:35.000
And he's, so I'm happy.

646
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.88
So he says, I see you have a master's degree.

647
00:35:37.88 --> 00:35:40.12
I said, yes, sir.

648
00:35:40.12 --> 00:35:44.44
And he said, our battalion accident is leaving.

649
00:35:44.44 --> 00:35:48.20
And you have a degree in English.

650
00:35:48.20 --> 00:35:50.52
You can see where this is going, right?

651
00:35:50.52 --> 00:35:52.84
And I said, yes, sir, and he said, well,

652
00:35:52.84 --> 00:35:56.20
how would you like to be the battalion accident?

653
00:35:56.20 --> 00:35:59.24
And I said, sir, I'm honored that you would even

654
00:35:59.24 --> 00:36:03.56
consider this, but I'm really happy, you know,

655
00:36:03.56 --> 00:36:04.84
leading soldiers.

656
00:36:04.84 --> 00:36:07.40
And he said, do you tell him I'm not looking for a

657
00:36:07.40 --> 00:36:09.56
hapiness in my battalion?

658
00:36:09.56 --> 00:36:13.16
You will report on Monday morning, yes, sir.

659
00:36:13.16 --> 00:36:17.08
So off I went, and I became the battalion to

660
00:36:17.08 --> 00:36:17.56
accident.

661
00:36:17.56 --> 00:36:20.52
But that once again was a great experience for me,

662
00:36:20.52 --> 00:36:25.08
because I learned a lot of the admin stuff.

663
00:36:25.08 --> 00:36:29.88
And unfortunately, and some, I also saw some bad stuff going on,

664
00:36:29.88 --> 00:36:31.96
which I was not happy with.

665
00:36:31.96 --> 00:36:34.76
I saw, you know, because obviously,

666
00:36:34.76 --> 00:36:39.16
accident, what I didn't tell you was, that was that battalion level.

667
00:36:39.16 --> 00:36:44.44
The brigade accident left, and they called me up to brigade to be the brigade.

668
00:36:44.44 --> 00:36:45.80
And I'm a first lieutenant.

669
00:36:45.80 --> 00:36:48.60
That's a major position, right?

670
00:36:48.60 --> 00:36:50.28
But I happen to be pretty good.

671
00:36:50.28 --> 00:36:53.40
And I was the best battalion accident, not all the

672
00:36:53.40 --> 00:36:54.36
battalions.

673
00:36:54.36 --> 00:36:59.000
So I go up there, I go up there to brigade to be the brigade accident.

674
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.24
And what I found was, you know, the officer efficiency

675
00:37:03.24 --> 00:37:07.40
reports and the OERs, I knew all the battalion commanders,

676
00:37:07.40 --> 00:37:09.48
because I dealt with them all.

677
00:37:09.48 --> 00:37:14.44
So if I Jim Moquayama were to rate the battalion commanders

678
00:37:14.44 --> 00:37:18.28
based on their leadership, right?

679
00:37:18.28 --> 00:37:22.04
And I would have rated them one, two, three, four.

680
00:37:22.04 --> 00:37:26.76
But I saw the reports going through, it was four, three, two, one.

681
00:37:26.76 --> 00:37:30.52
And that's because they were looking for managers,

682
00:37:30.52 --> 00:37:33.24
not commanders.

683
00:37:33.24 --> 00:37:36.04
And so that was, that was a tough,

684
00:37:36.04 --> 00:37:37.16
until the swallow.

685
00:37:37.16 --> 00:37:39.96
So I opening for you as a young man.

686
00:37:39.96 --> 00:37:40.12
Yeah.

687
00:37:40.12 --> 00:37:40.12
Yeah.

688
00:37:40.12 --> 00:37:40.12
Yeah.

689
00:37:40.12 --> 00:37:41.88
I know when I worked, I was the admiral's aide.

690
00:37:41.88 --> 00:37:46.36
And I saw, I didn't see stuff like that turned me off.

691
00:37:46.36 --> 00:37:49.88
But I saw, I just just getting a better grip on what was happening

692
00:37:49.88 --> 00:37:52.92
behind the scenes was very important for me,

693
00:37:52.92 --> 00:37:57.40
and it helped me out, you know, later on.

694
00:37:57.40 --> 00:38:01.32
And when you were in Fort Lewis, that's when you first met Hacourt, right?

695
00:38:01.32 --> 00:38:03.08
Absolutely correct.

696
00:38:03.08 --> 00:38:06.84
This was so cool when, when, when,

697
00:38:06.84 --> 00:38:10.36
now I'm a captain, by this time I'm a captain, right?

698
00:38:10.36 --> 00:38:16.36
And I'm at the, I'm the secretary general of the,

699
00:38:16.36 --> 00:38:19.16
of SGS.

700
00:38:19.16 --> 00:38:22.20
I was the secretary of the general staff, okay?

701
00:38:22.20 --> 00:38:25.48
What that means is obviously a system for the chief of staff,

702
00:38:25.48 --> 00:38:26.60
basically.

703
00:38:26.60 --> 00:38:28.84
And so, yeah.

704
00:38:28.84 --> 00:38:30.84
Do you know who Hacourt was?

705
00:38:30.84 --> 00:38:31.80
Oh, okay.

706
00:38:31.80 --> 00:38:35.48
We all, we all, I mean, Hacourt's a legend, you know,

707
00:38:35.48 --> 00:38:39.80
everybody knew who he was, but also because I had that job,

708
00:38:39.80 --> 00:38:44.60
one of my functions was, I was the guy who coordinated the general schedule,

709
00:38:44.60 --> 00:38:46.84
and the chief of SGS schedule.

710
00:38:46.84 --> 00:38:52.84
And Hacourt was reporting into Fort Lewis as a new battalion commander, okay?

711
00:38:52.84 --> 00:38:55.48
Well, whenever a new battalion commander came in,

712
00:38:55.48 --> 00:39:00.36
I always did research on the person, you know, so I could tell the general,

713
00:39:00.36 --> 00:39:02.84
you know, here's the guy who's coming, here's his background,

714
00:39:02.84 --> 00:39:04.84
well, Hacourt's was.

715
00:39:04.84 --> 00:39:07.40
You know, Mr. Infantry, basically.

716
00:39:07.40 --> 00:39:11.72
And so when he came to see the general, he walks into the headquarters,

717
00:39:11.72 --> 00:39:14.20
you know, I'm sitting behind his desk, he walks in,

718
00:39:14.20 --> 00:39:18.12
so I stand up, you know, I say welcome Colonel Hacourt to Fort Lewis,

719
00:39:18.12 --> 00:39:20.44
you know, the general will be with you in 10 minutes, you know,

720
00:39:20.44 --> 00:39:22.76
because he came early, right?

721
00:39:22.76 --> 00:39:25.24
The first words out of Hacourt's mouth,

722
00:39:25.24 --> 00:39:26.28
I'm not kidding.

723
00:39:26.28 --> 00:39:30.84
First words, what are you doing sitting behind the desk?

724
00:39:30.84 --> 00:39:33.000
He said you should have a company.

725
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.32
He said if you want one, I'll give it to you, okay?

726
00:39:37.32 --> 00:39:39.80
The guy doesn't know me from Adam, right?

727
00:39:39.80 --> 00:39:44.36
I mean, you know, but, you know, it was pretty sharp in the way of warming,

728
00:39:44.36 --> 00:39:48.36
you know, for my did have, you know, my jump wings and my E, I have an

729
00:39:48.36 --> 00:39:50.36
expert infantryman's badge, okay?

730
00:39:50.36 --> 00:39:53.000
And I had my E, I'd be, that's it.

731
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.56
I didn't wear any ribbons or A to stuff, and just the stuff that counted.

732
00:39:57.56 --> 00:39:59.08
As far as I was concerned.

733
00:39:59.08 --> 00:40:04.60
And so Hac sought that, you know, and I said, Colonel, I really appreciate, you know,

734
00:40:04.60 --> 00:40:09.40
what you're saying, but I came to the same conclusion that you did a couple months ago,

735
00:40:09.88 --> 00:40:17.000
and I've already talked to a battalion commander who's accepted me to take one of his companies.

736
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.20
So I'm committed to him, so I can't, you know, I'd love to take you up on your offer,

737
00:40:22.20 --> 00:40:25.40
but I can't, because I committed to the Southern Battalion commander.

738
00:40:25.40 --> 00:40:28.04
And Hac said I understand totally, okay?

739
00:40:28.04 --> 00:40:33.000
Well, that turned out to be another kind of thing, because later on, as you know, in the book,

740
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
he and I got together and we saved the career of a drill sergeant.

741
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:37.64
Mm-hmm.

742
00:40:37.64 --> 00:40:43.56
We, I just want to hear a little bit more about this, because it's something that I haven't

743
00:40:43.56 --> 00:40:45.32
been able to gather from anyone.

744
00:40:46.84 --> 00:40:51.16
You know, in my mind, you know, I thought everyone must look at Hac like,

745
00:40:51.16 --> 00:40:55.24
you know, this guy's Mr. Infantry as you put it, but I also would say to myself,

746
00:40:55.24 --> 00:40:59.80
well, you know, here's like, I'm thinking that because he wrote these books, and because I studied him,

747
00:40:59.80 --> 00:41:06.68
but that was an actual thing. People knew who he was by his reputation throughout the army.

748
00:41:06.68 --> 00:41:09.48
Yeah, it was not only his reputation, but his appearance.

749
00:41:10.36 --> 00:41:14.68
I mean, you know, his neck was probably the size of my waist.

750
00:41:14.68 --> 00:41:18.04
I mean, this, you know, Hac worth was just, you know, he always said,

751
00:41:18.04 --> 00:41:22.44
you know, he wasn't bald like today, you know, but you know,

752
00:41:23.40 --> 00:41:27.88
eighth of an inch, you know, razor sharp, you know, sides and all that.

753
00:41:27.88 --> 00:41:35.40
And what I didn't say is when he, Hac worth had this unique ability to size people up when he saw them.

754
00:41:35.40 --> 00:41:40.36
Like when he said that to me, and, and I've said this before, but Hac worth,

755
00:41:41.80 --> 00:41:45.72
his philosophy was, you're either a dud or a stud.

756
00:41:45.72 --> 00:41:48.28
And there was nothing in between.

757
00:41:48.92 --> 00:41:56.20
And he had this uncanny, I've seen it dozens of times where he actually did size guys up.

758
00:41:56.20 --> 00:41:59.80
And I never saw him this, on that evaluation.

759
00:42:00.04 --> 00:42:04.28
He just had this, this instinct, you know, the size guys up.

760
00:42:04.28 --> 00:42:10.20
And that's, and that's why he was successful as a commander because one of the principles is the

761
00:42:10.20 --> 00:42:17.000
surround yourself with good people. And so when he came to a unit, he found some guys that were

762
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.40
cutting it, they were gone. I mean, especially in combat, you know, he can't tolerate that,

763
00:42:22.20 --> 00:42:25.000
you know, and he would, and he had the strings that he could pull.

764
00:42:26.04 --> 00:42:29.72
And he had the relationships all over the place that seems.

765
00:42:29.72 --> 00:42:35.88
That's right. Now, how did, when did he leave with to go to Vietnam and take over the battalion?

766
00:42:35.88 --> 00:42:44.52
He, he probably let the sea, I left in May of 69. So it was probably end of 68 or maybe

767
00:42:44.52 --> 00:42:51.16
early 69. And, and he goes over, and he's over there for a few months. And then he ends up needing,

768
00:42:51.16 --> 00:42:55.88
well, he wants to surround himself with good people again. And so he reaches out to you.

769
00:42:55.88 --> 00:43:05.48
Yeah, how does that happen? Well, you know, I, I was still at Lewis as an AIT company commander.

770
00:43:06.12 --> 00:43:13.96
And another thing I should tell you at that time, I'm not real happy with the army because they never

771
00:43:13.96 --> 00:43:19.16
gave me any assignment or anything I ever asked for. Yeah, you're like, oh, for for it this point.

772
00:43:19.16 --> 00:43:24.36
Well, wait, are you ready for this? I, I get what I didn't tell you was in graduate school. I majored

773
00:43:24.36 --> 00:43:32.76
in Japanese history and Chinese history and political science and Japanese language in my masters of

774
00:43:32.76 --> 00:43:40.92
social studies. Okay. And I happened to be Japanese American. I happened to had a tour in Korea, right?

775
00:43:40.92 --> 00:43:47.000
We're, by the way, I didn't tell you, I got some awards from the Korean army. And so now the army

776
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:55.08
comes out with the foreign area specialty training program or fast. Okay. And the concept was a great

777
00:43:55.08 --> 00:44:00.44
concept, you know, in Vietnam, we got caught with our pants down because we didn't have any army experts

778
00:44:00.44 --> 00:44:07.000
in Vietnam. Nobody knew the culture, nobody knew the language, the politics, sound familiar. And so

779
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:14.44
basically, the army said, okay, we're going to develop geographic experts for the whole world.

780
00:44:14.44 --> 00:44:21.000
Okay. And we're going to call it the fast program. So I saw that and it was in the army times.

781
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.16
You know, they said, you have an interest called this number, you know, and so I called,

782
00:44:25.80 --> 00:44:30.84
you know, and he said, hey, look, pull up my record, you know, you'll see, you know, I'm,

783
00:44:30.84 --> 00:44:39.96
I've got my masters degree in Fari Senefers. Ethnicly, I'm Japanese. I've got a tour in Korea

784
00:44:39.96 --> 00:44:48.60
where I got some awards from the Korean army. Okay. And I'm regular army. Right. What are my

785
00:44:48.60 --> 00:44:54.84
chances of getting in this program? They should be 100% right? Are you ready for this? The first

786
00:44:54.84 --> 00:45:01.000
words out of their guy's mouth. You haven't been to Vietnam. And I said, well, that's right,

787
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:08.20
but if you go back in my record, you'll see, I volunteered for Vietnam. In the army sent me to Korea.

788
00:45:08.20 --> 00:45:14.44
Okay. He said that doesn't count. Okay. The second thing he said was you haven't been the career

789
00:45:14.44 --> 00:45:19.80
course advance course or officer. He got me there. I hadn't, you know, I was just a young captain.

790
00:45:19.80 --> 00:45:24.92
I hadn't been there. So in essence, he's telling me, you know, come back in a couple of years

791
00:45:24.92 --> 00:45:30.12
and maybe we'll think about it. You know, he didn't give me any encouragement. He didn't say,

792
00:45:30.12 --> 00:45:34.92
hey, you're a natural for this program. You know, I'll keep on monitoring your career,

793
00:45:34.92 --> 00:45:40.76
you know, he didn't do any of that stuff. And about that time, I got the letter from Hankworth saying,

794
00:45:40.76 --> 00:45:46.92
hey, move, we got a war going on. If you want a company at yours, and like, I hit the lotto,

795
00:45:46.92 --> 00:45:52.28
you know, and frankly, I was, I was thinking of, you know, resigning my regular army commission,

796
00:45:52.28 --> 00:45:58.28
but I hadn't been to Vietnam yet. And I was a bachelor. I had a lot of my friends who were married

797
00:45:58.28 --> 00:46:03.56
or going back for their second and third tours, you know, and I felt an object. And then I don't know

798
00:46:03.56 --> 00:46:09.16
you that, but I figured, well, maybe if I go, I'll change my mind, you know, and serving on your

799
00:46:09.16 --> 00:46:14.84
hand course would be the best opportunity I could have. So I jumped at it, you know, and I went,

800
00:46:14.84 --> 00:46:20.20
but things did not happen. How did you get orders? I mean, you know, I know hack worth had some

801
00:46:20.20 --> 00:46:25.64
relationships with people, but just to get a guy deployed to be in his battalion, how did you

802
00:46:25.64 --> 00:46:30.76
put, how did he pull that off? What did it look like? Well, I mean, I, I called my infantry officer

803
00:46:30.76 --> 00:46:36.44
assignment guy, whom I never spoken to in the five years I was on active duty, right? Because I

804
00:46:36.44 --> 00:46:44.04
always felt that I shouldn't be managing my own career, you know, and if I, if I did my job,

805
00:46:44.04 --> 00:46:49.32
that the army would, you know, I, I'd be treated, okay, you know, well, none of that ever happened,

806
00:46:49.32 --> 00:46:54.84
right? So I called the sky at the Pentagon and I say, hey, I'm volunteering for Vietnam again,

807
00:46:54.84 --> 00:47:02.68
and he basically said, well, okay, you know, give me your phone number, in case we lose connection

808
00:47:02.68 --> 00:47:08.92
here, and, and then he said, and I said, but I have a stipulation, I need to go to the night division,

809
00:47:09.64 --> 00:47:15.32
and he said, okay, I can make that happen. When do you want to go? I said, as soon as possible,

810
00:47:15.96 --> 00:47:21.16
and this is February, and he said, why can get you there in August? And I said, nope, that's not

811
00:47:21.16 --> 00:47:27.96
soon enough. He said, how about April? I said, sold. So I got orders to, you know, now everybody told

812
00:47:27.96 --> 00:47:35.40
me in the world at that time, here I am, infantry regular army captain going to Vietnam. When I hit

813
00:47:35.40 --> 00:47:41.88
the repo depot, they could assign me anywhere. You know, and the orders meant nothing, you know,

814
00:47:41.88 --> 00:47:48.12
because captain's infantry captain's were a dime a dozen. So when I get to Vietnam,

815
00:47:48.12 --> 00:47:56.04
everything was Greece, night division. I went from the night, I went from from, from Saigon,

816
00:47:56.04 --> 00:48:02.20
right to the night division at Dong Tam. You know, I landed there, I got my orders to his battalion.

817
00:48:02.20 --> 00:48:08.04
It's all all Greece. What you doing some kind of like Vietnam indoctrination for a week long

818
00:48:08.04 --> 00:48:15.16
and hack pulled you out two days into it or something? Yeah, I was so upset. They had a five day

819
00:48:15.16 --> 00:48:23.48
in country training program for newbies, okay? Especially, you know, in the Delta,

820
00:48:24.68 --> 00:48:31.40
I'd say 85% of our casualties were from booby traps. And so we were, and there was a special

821
00:48:32.60 --> 00:48:39.32
terrain, you know, with rice paddies and, and a canals and, you know, just the whole thing was totally

822
00:48:39.32 --> 00:48:46.20
different. And so they had this five day training course to acclimate you and to understand the booby traps

823
00:48:46.20 --> 00:48:51.16
and the terrain and all this stuff. And I'm in it for two days and I'm pulled out of the course.

824
00:48:51.72 --> 00:48:57.40
And I put on a helicopter and they take me down to, you know, the battalion fire support base

825
00:48:57.40 --> 00:49:02.52
and I'm mattered in the wet hen. You know, and I go to half and I say, sir, you know, how can

826
00:49:02.52 --> 00:49:08.12
you do this to me? I mean, I'm trying to learn how to stay alive, you know, so I can, and he said,

827
00:49:08.12 --> 00:49:12.68
moke, you don't need that stuff. I know you, you know, yes, sir, yes, sir, I have.

828
00:49:13.56 --> 00:49:17.56
And when you showed up, so for those of you that hadn't read, haven't read the books or listened to

829
00:49:17.56 --> 00:49:22.60
the other podcasts about this, hack worth it showed up. But he was requested by name to go and take

830
00:49:22.60 --> 00:49:27.40
over the 439th and Vietnam, which was a, which was a battalion that was having a lot of problems.

831
00:49:28.12 --> 00:49:34.12
And he went in there and he fixed it. I mean, that's, there's no, simple way to put it. He went in there

832
00:49:34.12 --> 00:49:41.08
and squared that battalion away and made them from hopeless to hardcore is the terms that get used.

833
00:49:42.12 --> 00:49:47.24
When you showed up, the heat already been there for a while, so things were pretty solid at that point.

834
00:49:47.24 --> 00:49:53.88
Oh, they were, they were so good. It was incredible. In fact, the first guy I met when I, when I got

835
00:49:53.88 --> 00:50:02.28
there was our battalion this forward, his name was Mario Takahashi. He was actually a national guard guy from Hawaii.

836
00:50:02.28 --> 00:50:07.88
He was about six, two or six, three big Japanese guy. You know, not like me.

837
00:50:07.88 --> 00:50:08.92
The tall was hack worth.

838
00:50:10.68 --> 00:50:11.32
Yeah, of course.

839
00:50:11.32 --> 00:50:14.92
Because you just, you made it sound when you said the talking about his neck, was he like a

840
00:50:14.92 --> 00:50:20.28
bait because he, in pictures, he always looks pretty lean and, and not very physically large.

841
00:50:20.28 --> 00:50:25.96
Well, when I, I mean, he was, he was stout. Okay. I mean, he wasn't, he wasn't real, he was

842
00:50:25.96 --> 00:50:32.60
in real tall, but just the way he carried himself. That's what I always envisioned was he was just

843
00:50:32.60 --> 00:50:37.000
a guy that if you walked away, go, I bet that. You know, how tall was hack worth? Oh, he's six eight.

844
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.60
Yeah. You know, when you find out he's whatever five enters. And not only that, but I'll tell you.

845
00:50:42.60 --> 00:50:49.56
He, when I became a general later on in life and, and he came to one of my, every, every year,

846
00:50:49.56 --> 00:50:56.84
I used to have a leadership conference for my, my officers and my NCOs that I would invite speakers

847
00:50:56.84 --> 00:51:03.88
to come to. And hack worth came to one of my conferences and then he visited me in Chicago

848
00:51:03.88 --> 00:51:11.08
when he was doing his, about face book, right? And so he invited me in my wife and kids to

849
00:51:11.72 --> 00:51:16.68
have dinner with him one night. You know, he always said, bring your kids, you know, some guys

850
00:51:16.68 --> 00:51:21.80
would say, no, just, you know, bring your wife or whatever, because my kids were fairly young,

851
00:51:21.80 --> 00:51:27.96
and then we're really young, they were maybe eight or nine, you know, at that time. And my wife

852
00:51:27.96 --> 00:51:35.32
and the kids actually commented about how soft spoken Hamworth was. He wasn't a blustery guy.

853
00:51:37.56 --> 00:51:43.72
You know, among guys, yeah, but, you know, in the, in public with, you know, women and family

854
00:51:43.72 --> 00:51:50.84
members, he was, he was a gentleman, which kind of surprised my wife because I told him well about,

855
00:51:52.20 --> 00:52:01.88
and so, but that's, that's how he was. And, and so the, the, the battalion you show up, it's just,

856
00:52:01.88 --> 00:52:07.24
the guys are really on board with what's going on. Oh, absolutely, because I got there

857
00:52:07.24 --> 00:52:16.52
probably three weeks before our, our famous, but it wasn't really a battle on 22 May, where we

858
00:52:16.52 --> 00:52:27.24
decimated a VC training battalion basically. And I remember being at the talk, you know,

859
00:52:27.24 --> 00:52:33.48
when he's planning on this hack, where it's had this innate quality, get just smell out the enemy,

860
00:52:33.48 --> 00:52:38.12
you know, even with all the intelligence we get and all this stuff, you know, he was able to

861
00:52:38.12 --> 00:52:45.000
figure out what they were doing. And so he, he set us up for that night, but to answer to you,

862
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:50.44
dress with you, or saying, by the time I got there, talk on Hashie was the first guy in that, okay,

863
00:52:50.44 --> 00:52:57.32
he was really a strong, straight student and he was the S4. And so he got all the equipment for

864
00:52:57.32 --> 00:53:03.24
the battalion and he got it, whatever way he had to get it, you know. And then I meet the next guy,

865
00:53:03.24 --> 00:53:08.92
me, is another, is a company commander. And that guy was like six, three or something, you know,

866
00:53:08.92 --> 00:53:14.84
so I'm seeing a pattern here, right? And I'm five foot five, okay? And but here's a cool thing about

867
00:53:14.84 --> 00:53:20.52
this, one of the other company commanders, his name was Don Meyer. And by the way, hackers

868
00:53:20.52 --> 00:53:29.40
had this really cool way of of using words and terms and titles that, you know, like our

869
00:53:29.40 --> 00:53:37.56
companies were not Alpha Bravo Charlie Delta. They were alert, battle, claim, or and dagger, okay?

870
00:53:37.56 --> 00:53:45.80
And the claim or a company commander was a guy by name, a Don Meyer's. Don Meyer's was my roommate

871
00:53:45.80 --> 00:53:53.56
in college at the University of Illinois. And we both were infantry, our OTC guys, right? And then later,

872
00:53:53.56 --> 00:53:59.16
he was, he was with the hundred and first and he was wounded, so they shook them to the Simmons.

873
00:54:00.04 --> 00:54:06.36
And then they assigned him the Fort Lewis, which was where hackworth and I were. So Don and I were

874
00:54:06.36 --> 00:54:13.16
roommates again for Lewis Washington, okay? So then hackworth ships to be at none and he takes

875
00:54:13.16 --> 00:54:20.44
Myers with him, okay? So no Myers, who, by the way, is six foot three, right? And this nickname was

876
00:54:20.44 --> 00:54:26.20
Lank. And when he and I were in college as roommates, it was like mutton Jeff, you know?

877
00:54:26.84 --> 00:54:33.72
And I wasn't the tall guy. And so anyway, but as you, as you can understand, to have,

878
00:54:33.72 --> 00:54:41.08
I commanded battle company and he commanded claim or company. And I knew that if we were going to

879
00:54:41.08 --> 00:54:47.88
run into any cramp, you know, that he would, he would be there for me. And he knew I would be there for

880
00:54:47.88 --> 00:54:56.84
him. And that was, that was, it just, it was really good. Yeah, that whole thing with names is

881
00:54:56.84 --> 00:55:02.20
something that I completely ripped off from hackworth when I was a task unit commander, our task

882
00:55:02.20 --> 00:55:07.56
unit was called, whether it was Alpha Bravo and Charlie and I had Bravo and immediately when I

883
00:55:07.56 --> 00:55:13.000
took it over, I changed the name from Bravo to Bruser. And that's was that changed the attitude

884
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:19.64
of people. It really does. Well, I also, as you know, all elite units have, have greetings and

885
00:55:19.64 --> 00:55:27.80
counter signs, right? So for the hardcore, our, our model was hardcore recondo, that was what the

886
00:55:27.80 --> 00:55:36.04
greeting was. The countersign, which I cannot say totally was no effing slack. Okay. Yeah.

887
00:55:36.04 --> 00:55:41.08
But I'll tell you, there were guys, I saw this, I witnessed this. There were guys who were wounded

888
00:55:41.08 --> 00:55:46.60
on stretchers. And hackers would walk up to them and they'd salute them and say hardcore recondo.

889
00:55:50.28 --> 00:55:56.20
What kind of missions did you do when you showed up there? So you take over your company commander?

890
00:55:56.20 --> 00:56:04.84
Yeah, they were, they were, they were just really reconsurge and disdrew. I'm not really

891
00:56:04.84 --> 00:56:13.48
destroyed, but you know, we were, we were seeking out the VC, but as it got closer to, we know we were

892
00:56:13.48 --> 00:56:21.16
leaving, right? Because President Nixon had said that, you know. So it just got to be, you know,

893
00:56:21.16 --> 00:56:24.84
we kind of the area, make sure they weren't there. If they were there, we get into firefight

894
00:56:24.84 --> 00:56:33.32
so that didn't happen very often. It was mostly booby traps and things. And basically, that was it,

895
00:56:33.32 --> 00:56:40.60
because they, you know, they're smart. They knew we were leaving. So why go and, why get into contact?

896
00:56:40.60 --> 00:56:45.16
Right. You're leaving. Now you, you were showing me some pictures earlier. You're,

897
00:56:46.28 --> 00:56:52.52
pretty famous picture that got published. It's, someone, uh, your, your RTO had just been wounded.

898
00:56:52.52 --> 00:56:57.72
What was the story on that? Yeah, this is one of our operations and there was a booby trap and,

899
00:56:57.72 --> 00:57:04.12
and he was, uh, he got a sucking chest wound from it and, and I got a little shrapnel, not a lot.

900
00:57:04.12 --> 00:57:11.72
And, uh, basically, I called in a MetaVat helicopter and the helicopter came in and unbeknownst to us.

901
00:57:11.72 --> 00:57:20.20
There was a UPI photographer on the helicopter and he snapped a picture of my guy's carrying

902
00:57:20.20 --> 00:57:26.20
my wounded RTO on a structure towards the helicopter. And that became like the UPI

903
00:57:26.20 --> 00:57:31.32
picture for the day that went around the world. You know, the Vietnam photograph. I didn't even

904
00:57:31.32 --> 00:57:36.36
know to exist until three years later. I was out. I was off and back to duty. I was reading

905
00:57:36.36 --> 00:57:41.72
on U.S. News and World Report magazine and the picture was like three inches by four inches

906
00:57:41.72 --> 00:57:46.68
in the magazine. But it was all my soldiers, you know, and I saw it and I said, hey, and then I saw

907
00:57:46.68 --> 00:57:53.40
I was in the picture. So I'm kind of, in the picture so you can see me. So, uh, I got the photo

908
00:57:53.40 --> 00:57:58.28
from them. I get asked a lot and it's something that I don't have any experience with

909
00:57:59.08 --> 00:58:06.92
is what it was like having drafties as, you know, I was in all volunteer military and then on top of

910
00:58:06.92 --> 00:58:11.16
that, you know, the unit I worked with, we were all volunteered again. You know, you volunteer to

911
00:58:11.16 --> 00:58:16.92
come in the new volunteer again to try and be in the seal teams and people ask what it was like

912
00:58:16.92 --> 00:58:22.60
working with drafties. Now, hackworth's opinion was drafties were good because they didn't care

913
00:58:22.60 --> 00:58:26.68
about their career and if they thought something was wrong, they'd say, hey, this is crap. We don't

914
00:58:26.68 --> 00:58:31.80
want to do that or hey, you're not telling the truth to us. And so he thought it was good and it kept

915
00:58:31.80 --> 00:58:38.28
the army in check. But there's still how to be some leadership differences in dealing with an

916
00:58:38.28 --> 00:58:41.64
and later in your career. Obviously, you started working with the all volunteer army. What did you

917
00:58:41.64 --> 00:58:49.40
notice about the drafties that you learned from? Well, the drafties just like, and it doesn't

918
00:58:49.40 --> 00:58:56.28
make any difference or your drafties or or volunteers. It depends on the leadership and, you know,

919
00:58:56.28 --> 00:59:06.12
they'll respond the good leadership and the drafties were like anyone else. Once you're in the position,

920
00:59:06.12 --> 00:59:10.36
you're going to do the best you can, especially when you're in combat because you want to survive.

921
00:59:11.08 --> 00:59:17.40
And by that time it gets to be a bonding thing. You're not there fighting for liberty and just

922
00:59:17.40 --> 00:59:22.12
this in the American way. You're fighting for the guide to the right of you and the guide to the

923
00:59:22.12 --> 00:59:27.40
left of you, basically. Because you're every day you're living together, you're dying together,

924
00:59:27.40 --> 00:59:33.96
you know, and so it's a function of leadership and the drafties were great guys. I mean,

925
00:59:34.60 --> 00:59:40.12
I'd serve with them anywhere. In fact, I didn't even know who was stranded. I didn't care. I didn't ask

926
00:59:40.84 --> 00:59:45.000
you know, whether there are drafties or volunteers, although the vast majority of our guys were

927
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:52.60
drafties in the fourth or the 39th. And that's what was so cool about it that hackers could take

928
00:59:52.60 --> 00:59:58.28
that Italian and turn it around. And I heard stories because I came later on, you know, but he had

929
00:59:58.28 --> 01:00:04.20
a price on and said initially. Yeah, a price on his head from his own guys. Yeah, well, yeah,

930
01:00:04.20 --> 01:00:11.40
but nobody had the gonads to step up and clean the, clean the price. So yeah, I mean, one of the things

931
01:00:11.40 --> 01:00:15.96
he talks about and again, I've talked about this on another podcast, but you know, when he showed

932
01:00:15.96 --> 01:00:20.36
up, everyone had whatever they had guitars and they had radios and they had, you know, big

933
01:00:20.36 --> 01:00:25.40
hammocks for themselves and he got there and said, okay, anything that you can't carry on your back

934
01:00:25.40 --> 01:00:29.16
is going to be in the middle of our base tomorrow morning. It's getting shipped out on helicopters.

935
01:00:29.16 --> 01:00:34.76
So people went crazy. Are you kidding me? Well, not only that. You don't what he did. I'm true. You know

936
01:00:34.76 --> 01:00:39.96
this, but he took away class A meals. Oh, I did not know that or I don't remember it because

937
01:00:39.96 --> 01:00:49.000
there was so, they were so, how to say this nicely. They, they were not disciplined. Okay.

938
01:00:49.80 --> 01:00:56.68
They had lousy leadership before that and, uh, Hackworth basically said, you know, you guys are soldiers

939
01:00:56.68 --> 01:01:02.36
and he said, I'm going to keep you alive, you know, but you're going to have to soldier. So he actually

940
01:01:02.36 --> 01:01:07.32
took class A's away and initially he made them shine their boots and they're like, I mean,

941
01:01:07.32 --> 01:01:13.24
you know, stuff that sounds crazy. Yeah. You know, but he was getting their attention. Yeah. You know,

942
01:01:13.24 --> 01:01:18.68
and cleaning weapons. I mean, they would, you know, they were not cleaning. I mean, how crazy is that?

943
01:01:18.68 --> 01:01:24.68
They were cleaning their weapons. At nighttime there was night discipline. Light discipline was

944
01:01:24.68 --> 01:01:29.96
almost non-existent. I mean, it was crazy. And Hackworth made them, you know, soldier up and

945
01:01:29.96 --> 01:01:37.72
and, and, uh, but then what happened was, uh, they started to use his tactics and they found out

946
01:01:37.72 --> 01:01:43.88
that, hey, this works. I mean, we're not taking casualties like we did before. We're actually

947
01:01:43.88 --> 01:01:51.72
inflicting casualties that we weren't doing before. And then he started to give stuff back.

948
01:01:51.72 --> 01:01:58.76
Oh, you know what else he did? He took away beer. I mean, beer was like water. I mean,

949
01:01:58.76 --> 01:02:04.12
you know, the average temperature was like 95 degrees, you know, and all that. And it was like

950
01:02:04.12 --> 01:02:10.44
three point two. Whatever the beer was, you know, but he took that away initially too. And people thought he was

951
01:02:10.44 --> 01:02:15.72
nuts. Yeah. Actually, there's a great quote in about face. It's some guy right in home to us.

952
01:02:15.72 --> 01:02:19.56
It's just a quote from a letter. Somebody wrote out wrote, you know, my new company, my new

953
01:02:19.56 --> 01:02:23.72
betelian commander's crazy. I don't know what's going to happen. That's literally a letter or a guy

954
01:02:23.72 --> 01:02:30.76
right home. It's interesting to me. So I've seen this and I'm sure you've seen this in your career.

955
01:02:30.76 --> 01:02:34.20
I've seen it in the business world. I'm sure you've seen the business world in the military.

956
01:02:35.16 --> 01:02:42.60
Guys that go so far in that direction of being so hardcore and over the top that they break

957
01:02:42.60 --> 01:02:48.12
their guys and people don't actually like them and they don't want to serve them and they don't

958
01:02:48.12 --> 01:02:54.68
want to do good job because they're too focused on stuff that doesn't really matter. And

959
01:02:54.68 --> 01:03:01.24
hack was just, he seemed to have this ability to balance it so well between being hardcore and yet

960
01:03:01.24 --> 01:03:05.08
at the same time, everybody knows that he's going to take care of many loves him.

961
01:03:05.88 --> 01:03:11.96
Yeah. That was the main thing because they knew that they were going to, they were going to

962
01:03:11.96 --> 01:03:17.40
live under his command if they followed what he said. And there would be successful too.

963
01:03:17.40 --> 01:03:26.76
Don't forget that success breeds success. And so the hardcore is they kept on progressing.

964
01:03:27.16 --> 01:03:35.32
He became prouder and prouder of, you know, in the guys. It was just a unit that nobody wanted

965
01:03:35.32 --> 01:03:42.04
to reckon with. And that's how it was. But hack led by example, I can't, I just can't emphasize

966
01:03:42.04 --> 01:03:51.80
that enough. You know, I have my leadership mantra which, you know, I'm a simple guy. So I boil

967
01:03:51.80 --> 01:03:57.64
the boil things down simply. And it's a three words example, carrying and balance.

968
01:03:58.52 --> 01:04:04.04
And you got to lead by personal example. It's not, you know, do what I say, but do what I do.

969
01:04:04.04 --> 01:04:14.52
And carrying is the care for your soldiers. And, you know, carrying means, especially in combat,

970
01:04:14.52 --> 01:04:20.04
keeping them alive. That's how you care for them. And you train tough. You know, I mean,

971
01:04:20.04 --> 01:04:25.96
hack worth always mentioned that, you know, the harder you train, you know, the better the

972
01:04:25.96 --> 01:04:31.32
delperform and combat. In fact, sometimes it was easier in combat than, you know, some of the training

973
01:04:31.32 --> 01:04:37.56
that he'd make them go through. And, and finally, is balance to, especially leaders. And I'm

974
01:04:37.56 --> 01:04:45.16
talking to leaders, right? And I always told my leaders that you've got to maintain a balance between

975
01:04:45.16 --> 01:04:54.36
your professional, military job and your family. And I used to tell my guys, you're not doing

976
01:04:54.36 --> 01:04:59.48
many good if you're going through a divorce. You know, and too many guys, it's easy when you get

977
01:04:59.48 --> 01:05:06.36
promoted to get kind of caught up in the perks and in the responsibility, you know, see you work

978
01:05:06.36 --> 01:05:12.76
harder to be more, and then what do you do? You ignore your family. And then things fall apart.

979
01:05:12.76 --> 01:05:19.56
And so I, I warned my soldiers. I always said, you know, maintain that balance. And I tried to do

980
01:05:19.56 --> 01:05:25.96
that not only personally, but to get my, so when we were mobilized, for example, okay, my division.

981
01:05:25.96 --> 01:05:32.44
Now, this was not, we didn't deploy overseas. We were a training division. Our wartime mission

982
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:39.24
was the Army reserves, by the way, was the only service that had this. We, we had reservist,

983
01:05:39.24 --> 01:05:45.96
whose wartime mission was to take over the training of the recruits at the active duty stations,

984
01:05:45.96 --> 01:05:52.84
which would then release those active duty soldiers to go join forces. It made a lot of sense, you know.

985
01:05:52.84 --> 01:06:00.12
So, so when that happened, I, I went to my staff. Now, you have to understand, this is like the

986
01:06:00.12 --> 01:06:10.12
late 80s, right? Okay? And I went to my staff and I said, I want a 24 hour, 800 number

987
01:06:11.24 --> 01:06:17.16
from my family support program. I want my soldiers to know, and I want their spouses to know

988
01:06:17.16 --> 01:06:25.08
that while they're deployed, if there's any problems, they can count on us. And I want it to be

989
01:06:25.08 --> 01:06:30.92
24-7, man. And they said, General, you have to understand those, they's 800 numbers were pretty expensive.

990
01:06:30.92 --> 01:06:37.000
And, and they said, you know, number one is going to be expensive. Number two, you know, 24-7,

991
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:43.88
you know, and I said, make it happen. Because I, I, the last thing I wanted my soldiers who were

992
01:06:43.88 --> 01:06:51.32
deployed to worry about was their families, right? And then what I did is I, I had the two-star

993
01:06:51.32 --> 01:06:56.92
stationery, you know, as, as a major general, little notes, you know, they're not eight and a half by 11.

994
01:06:56.92 --> 01:07:05.000
They're little note things. So I told my staff, I want to send a personally signed note to every

995
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:13.64
spouse or significant other of the Floyd soldier in this division. And I'm on a note to go

996
01:07:13.64 --> 01:07:21.16
to their employer, because you have to understand these are reservists, right? Okay? So I had 1500 soldiers

997
01:07:22.28 --> 01:07:28.36
mobilized, right? So this is 3,000 letters that I'm going to sign, you know, personally. They

998
01:07:28.36 --> 01:07:35.56
wanted me to use an auto, auto pen, you know, by computer, you know, manufacturer, your signature.

999
01:07:35.56 --> 01:07:41.64
I said, no way, these are, these are going, you know. So I, I did that. And what happened was,

1000
01:07:41.64 --> 01:07:49.000
I was, I had a cousin whose husband was a steel seal salesman, okay? And she calls me in

1001
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.76
the day. She said, you'll never know what happened to my husband. He was making a call on this company

1002
01:07:54.76 --> 01:08:01.88
in Indiana, okay? And on the wall was one of my letters. You know, very cool to them. And he saw

1003
01:08:01.88 --> 01:08:11.08
my name on it, you know. So caring for your caring and balance is important. Yeah, yeah, you know,

1004
01:08:15.16 --> 01:08:21.40
you talked about that, that operation that was so well planned and so well executed. And you

1005
01:08:21.40 --> 01:08:31.08
talked about hack words, sort of six cents instinct. And then, you know, I've heard you talk

1006
01:08:31.08 --> 01:08:38.52
in some other interviews about a situation that you were in. That was that you described as really

1007
01:08:39.24 --> 01:08:47.000
sort of impacting your your mental state. And to me, when I heard you talk about it,

1008
01:08:47.88 --> 01:08:54.60
it seemed to be almost like a turning point mentally, psychologically for you. And I had to do with

1009
01:08:54.60 --> 01:09:01.88
you overrunning a position and you end up with some some. Yeah, I didn't realize the impact of that

1010
01:09:01.88 --> 01:09:09.64
incident until many, many years later. But in order for me to explain that, I have to talk about something

1011
01:09:09.64 --> 01:09:18.28
called moral injury, which is when they so called invisible wounds of war. A lot of people are

1012
01:09:18.28 --> 01:09:25.32
familiar with post-traumatic stress disorder. A lot of people are aware of traumatic brain injury.

1013
01:09:26.04 --> 01:09:31.80
But when you asked them that they could describe the invisible wound of war called moral injury,

1014
01:09:32.52 --> 01:09:37.80
very few people are knowledgeable about that. How long has that term been used?

1015
01:09:37.80 --> 01:09:47.88
There was a psychiatrist at the VA, Dr. Jonathan Shey, who basically coined that phrase in 2009.

1016
01:09:48.60 --> 01:09:54.76
So it's been around for a while. And now it's starting to really pick up steam in research

1017
01:09:55.56 --> 01:10:05.08
because of its significance in contributing to the high suicide rate, among veterans.

1018
01:10:05.08 --> 01:10:14.92
And the concept is, when I go around and I give presentations and I tell people, the concept is so

1019
01:10:14.92 --> 01:10:21.08
intuitive, you'll get it in 30 seconds. Okay, so here it is. From the time you're born until you're 18

1020
01:10:21.08 --> 01:10:27.72
years old, you develop a personal moral code, sense of right or wrong. That could come from your

1021
01:10:27.72 --> 01:10:35.56
family, your religion, community, friends, whatever. And then you join the military and you learn

1022
01:10:35.56 --> 01:10:43.16
a warrior code. The warrior code is superimposed on your personal moral code and in fact transforms

1023
01:10:43.16 --> 01:10:49.96
it somewhat. Then you might have to participate in activities or operations that violate your

1024
01:10:49.96 --> 01:10:56.92
personal moral code, such as killing. You don't have to be the person that pulls the trigger.

1025
01:10:56.92 --> 01:11:03.24
You could be a witness or you could feel that you should have prevented it or you could be

1026
01:11:03.24 --> 01:11:09.24
in a unit to follow another unit and you see that innocent civilians have been killed or you

1027
01:11:09.24 --> 01:11:17.08
handle body parts. At that time you sustained a so-called invisible wound of war called moral injury.

1028
01:11:17.08 --> 01:11:23.96
It's not a physical wound. You can't see it. But in military operations, we're constantly moving.

1029
01:11:23.96 --> 01:11:29.32
You're going from point A to point B to point C. You don't have time to stop and reflect on this

1030
01:11:29.32 --> 01:11:40.68
stuff. So what do you do? You bury it. And it becomes unresolved grief, shame, and what happens is

1031
01:11:40.68 --> 01:11:46.44
you come back to the states and let's say you leave the military or you're in the national guard

1032
01:11:46.44 --> 01:11:53.88
or reserves and you come back to a community anywhere in the country that doesn't understand what

1033
01:11:53.88 --> 01:12:00.44
you've been through and it boils up to the surface. And unless you have a strong coping mechanism

1034
01:12:00.44 --> 01:12:08.76
for that bad stuff happens, anger, guilt, depression, suicide. And the suicide rate among

1035
01:12:08.76 --> 01:12:15.56
veterans today is epidemic. I mean the VA is anywhere from 20 to 22 veterans per day are dying

1036
01:12:15.56 --> 01:12:21.32
by suicide and that frankly is under-reported. It's really higher than that because you've got

1037
01:12:21.32 --> 01:12:29.80
veterans who are dying by suicide is not reported as a suicide. Though drive their motorcycle or

1038
01:12:29.80 --> 01:12:37.000
car into a tree or by duct and it's a vehicular accident or unfortunately there's something

1039
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:43.72
called suicide by cop where they force the law enforcement officer to take lethal action.

1040
01:12:44.60 --> 01:12:50.44
And so what's the implication of all that? We lose more veterans to suicide in a year than all

1041
01:12:50.44 --> 01:12:58.60
the combat dust since 9-11. That's how dramatic it is. And we believe that moral injury is a major

1042
01:12:58.60 --> 01:13:06.92
contributing factor to that. And military outreach USA, our organization, we feel that the main

1043
01:13:06.92 --> 01:13:14.84
approach to moral injury is not a medical doctor with prescription drugs. It's the forgiveness

1044
01:13:14.84 --> 01:13:23.32
and grace of a moral authority and the counseling of clergy and sensitive therapists and the

1045
01:13:23.32 --> 01:13:29.96
support of a community offering hope and help. And so now getting back to that incident that

1046
01:13:29.96 --> 01:13:36.12
you asked me about, Jockel, I was a company commander battle company. We had just overrun

1047
01:13:36.12 --> 01:13:45.000
a vehicle composition and killed numerous enemies and I literally had three dead bodies sent my feet.

1048
01:13:45.72 --> 01:13:52.44
Well, the time the unit is most vulnerable is right after a victory. It's just human nature to let

1049
01:13:52.44 --> 01:13:59.88
your guard down and breathe the side relief. When the guy in charge, I know that. So I'm on my radio

1050
01:13:59.88 --> 01:14:06.28
and I'm kicking rear end and taking names. I'm telling my platoon leaders, reorganize your units,

1051
01:14:06.28 --> 01:14:13.24
redistribute ammunition, take care of your wounded, look for enemy avenues of approach for a counterattack,

1052
01:14:13.24 --> 01:14:21.24
right? And in the middle of all that stuff going on, I stopped. And I looked at the three dead bodies

1053
01:14:21.24 --> 01:14:28.92
at my feet. I realized that something had happened to me, something had hardened my heart,

1054
01:14:28.92 --> 01:14:36.44
only moments earlier, these were alive human beings. They had families, they had emotions,

1055
01:14:36.44 --> 01:14:43.000
they had loved ones, they were fighting for something as important to them as I was fighting for.

1056
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.68
And I was in their backyard. And then I remember Jesus' sermon on the Mount,

1057
01:14:48.68 --> 01:14:53.96
we told us to pray for our enemies. So in the midst of all this stuff going on,

1058
01:14:53.96 --> 01:15:01.32
I set up prayer for the three be at Kong. And I know I was praying for myself, this much as I was

1059
01:15:01.32 --> 01:15:08.28
praying for them. Now, I didn't have a big ceremony, get on my hands and knees, any of that stuff.

1060
01:15:08.28 --> 01:15:14.04
You know, this all took about 45 seconds. But it's something that was seared in my heart and mind

1061
01:15:14.76 --> 01:15:21.32
for the rest of my life. And now that I know about moral injury, which I didn't know at that time,

1062
01:15:21.32 --> 01:15:30.20
I realized that I was one and a million who was able to address my moral injury at the time that happened.

1063
01:15:32.04 --> 01:15:37.32
And you know, I had always, when I came back from Vietnam, I had seen a lot of my comrades

1064
01:15:38.04 --> 01:15:45.72
having nightmares, having flashbacks, personality changes, and I frankly asked myself,

1065
01:15:45.72 --> 01:15:51.80
how come I'm not going through that? Okay. And at the time, my answer always was my faith,

1066
01:15:52.68 --> 01:16:01.000
and my wife, my wonderful wife. Of now 46 years, who is an angel. I've been so blessed

1067
01:16:01.48 --> 01:16:07.16
having her for a wife. So that was my answer, okay. But now, since I've been dealing with military

1068
01:16:07.16 --> 01:16:13.56
outreach USA and this issue of moral injury, I realized that my answer was really lacking.

1069
01:16:13.56 --> 01:16:19.72
Okay. There were two other things. One was that incident in Vietnam that I just mentioned to you.

1070
01:16:20.20 --> 01:16:26.28
But the other thing, which I now realized is when I came back from Vietnam, I joined the reserves.

1071
01:16:27.48 --> 01:16:33.96
Okay. And I was able to maintain my sense of purpose

1072
01:16:35.16 --> 01:16:42.52
of being in an unit with other people who shared the same values that I did, of patriotism,

1073
01:16:42.52 --> 01:16:49.08
of dedication, of selfless service, which a lot of veterans, when they come back, they just want

1074
01:16:49.08 --> 01:16:56.84
to cut ties totally and they a lot of them drift because they don't have that sense of purpose.

1075
01:16:57.40 --> 01:17:03.32
They don't have the camaraderie, they don't have the bonding. I had that with the reserveers,

1076
01:17:03.32 --> 01:17:09.08
especially with Vietnam and all the BS that we had to take from the public.

1077
01:17:09.08 --> 01:17:15.24
You won't believe this, but I know you know this. But when we came back from Vietnam,

1078
01:17:15.24 --> 01:17:20.04
we were told not to wear our uniforms in public. That's how bad it was.

1079
01:17:20.04 --> 01:17:25.96
That's crazy. You know, guys wore wigs so people wouldn't know they had short haircuts

1080
01:17:27.24 --> 01:17:34.84
because they could pick them up as being military. And so my being in the reserves helped me

1081
01:17:34.84 --> 01:17:43.16
maintain that. One of the things that I tell guys is very similar to what you just said.

1082
01:17:43.16 --> 01:17:46.68
You know, I tell guys you got to find a new mission when you get done. When you get done with the military,

1083
01:17:46.68 --> 01:17:50.68
you got to find a new mission. And if you can stay in the reserves, obviously, that gives you that.

1084
01:17:50.68 --> 01:17:54.36
But if you don't do that, well, then you got to find what are you going to do? What are you going to

1085
01:17:54.36 --> 01:17:58.12
step out there? Are you going to become a great dad? Are you going to build a business? Are you going

1086
01:17:58.12 --> 01:18:02.68
to work for a company and do a great job? Or you got to find a new mission? And I find that

1087
01:18:02.68 --> 01:18:08.28
guys that I've seen that have real problems, it's because they got out and they didn't have

1088
01:18:08.28 --> 01:18:13.96
any direction to go into. And also just to dig a little bit deeper. So you're in that situation

1089
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:22.36
where you see these guys and for the first time you kind of look down on them and see them as

1090
01:18:22.36 --> 01:18:31.56
people as other human beings. Is it, you know, is it the fact that you, when you set a prayer for them

1091
01:18:31.56 --> 01:18:39.32
and for yourself, I kind of got a thought of when you hear about like Native Americans hunting.

1092
01:18:39.96 --> 01:18:44.84
And you know, they, they think, you know, when they get a kill, they'll, they'll think

1093
01:18:44.84 --> 01:18:51.000
that mother nature and and thank for the sacrifice. Was it that type of thing where you said,

1094
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:56.52
okay, you know what we're fighting? I was doing my job. You guys were doing your job.

1095
01:18:56.52 --> 01:19:05.16
And I hope you have peace now. Was it that type of thing? Absolutely. Because, you know,

1096
01:19:05.16 --> 01:19:13.56
what happens is you forget that they're, they're dehumanized. But you know, you've got all these,

1097
01:19:13.56 --> 01:19:22.52
all these names that you call them. You know, but I really respected the VC, our enemy. You know,

1098
01:19:22.52 --> 01:19:29.72
that's the other thing. You can't underestimate your enemy. You always have to respect them.

1099
01:19:30.28 --> 01:19:34.92
You have, you know, I mean, you don't have to agree with them, but you, you have to respect

1100
01:19:35.64 --> 01:19:43.24
their abilities. Because once you lose track of that, you can really get screwed. And basically,

1101
01:19:43.96 --> 01:19:49.16
I'll give you some examples. When we had that battle on 22 May, okay, I wasn't the CNC

1102
01:19:49.16 --> 01:19:54.52
helicopter with. And I guess I should describe that battle a little bit more so you're listeners.

1103
01:19:54.52 --> 01:20:03.08
We're talking about the hardcore battalion. And when we surround this, this VC training battalion

1104
01:20:03.08 --> 01:20:09.000
really is what it was. And we annihilated it basically. They were, they were encircled. And we were

1105
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:15.56
just calling her in air strikes. Naval gunfire, you know, we were just taking, and then

1106
01:20:15.56 --> 01:20:21.48
hackworth had him totally encircled. And so I'll never forget I was in the helicopter with him.

1107
01:20:21.48 --> 01:20:29.64
And he basically said, MOOC, we got a, first we get a radio message from one of our companies.

1108
01:20:29.64 --> 01:20:34.76
It might have been an alert company. And they said, we just had a contact, you know, we killed three,

1109
01:20:34.76 --> 01:20:39.56
we've kept, you know, we got four weapons, we captured a guy or whatever. And they're headed

1110
01:20:39.56 --> 01:20:45.24
in this direction, okay? So hackworth would turn to me and say MOOC, you know, let's say,

1111
01:20:45.24 --> 01:20:51.96
given 15 minutes, we're going to hear from battle company. 15 minutes later, battle company comes

1112
01:20:51.96 --> 01:20:58.68
up. We just had a contact, you know, and they're heading, so this happened all day. Okay, I saw this.

1113
01:20:58.68 --> 01:21:04.84
I was with him in the helicopter. And, but there was one VC, we were flying near a canal.

1114
01:21:05.40 --> 01:21:11.64
And he was mortally wounded. You could see the guy was dying, basically. He took his AK 47

1115
01:21:11.64 --> 01:21:21.80
and he threw it into the canal. Okay? And the reason he did that is he didn't want us to get that weapon.

1116
01:21:23.08 --> 01:21:30.92
Because part of the body count was you matched how many weapons. You know, if a unit reported

1117
01:21:30.92 --> 01:21:35.56
and they said, well, we killed 20 and we got one weapon, you kind of say, wait a second.

1118
01:21:35.56 --> 01:21:42.68
You know, so when I saw that, I knew that this guy, you know, we were up against the tough enemy.

1119
01:21:43.72 --> 01:21:49.16
You know, and so you got to respect your enemy and

1120
01:21:51.16 --> 01:21:56.68
I want to pull some before we move past the Vietnam and hack. I want to pull some stuff out of about

1121
01:21:56.68 --> 01:22:04.12
face just to kind of hear your thoughts on it. I'm going to start off with one that you've talked

1122
01:22:04.12 --> 01:22:09.32
about a little bit, but here we go. This is from about face by David Hackworth and this is a quote

1123
01:22:09.32 --> 01:22:15.32
from someone else. It says, hack had the knack of being able to size people up very quickly,

1124
01:22:15.32 --> 01:22:21.80
almost instantaneously. And I'd say 99% of the time he was right. He could look at a person and

1125
01:22:21.80 --> 01:22:26.60
in his vernacular, the guy was either a stud or he wasn't. There was no in between.

1126
01:22:27.64 --> 01:22:33.80
If he was a stud, hack would find a way to get him. And he would not take no from people.

1127
01:22:33.80 --> 01:22:40.52
If he wanted them because he wanted a winning team. And if a person didn't want to go with him,

1128
01:22:40.52 --> 01:22:47.56
then immediately the guy wasn't a stud. You see, because anybody who knew hack or came into contact

1129
01:22:47.56 --> 01:22:53.08
with him really wanted to be with him after he'd known him for a while. And that's a quote from

1130
01:22:53.96 --> 01:23:01.40
Brigadier General James H. Mookayama, which is you. Okay. You're quoted in the book. And you've

1131
01:23:01.40 --> 01:23:07.32
talked about that a little bit. And he just had, he must have extremely magnetic personality.

1132
01:23:07.32 --> 01:23:11.08
For you to say that if you spent time with him, you wanted to be with him. Oh, absolutely. And

1133
01:23:11.08 --> 01:23:18.68
he, I used to say he had the mightest touch. Everything the guy touched. Just whether it was in the

1134
01:23:18.68 --> 01:23:26.44
military, whether it was in business, whether it was with women, in this guy, he was a stud himself.

1135
01:23:26.44 --> 01:23:35.48
And, you know, and, but he was, he was also a sensitive guy. I'll never forget when, you know,

1136
01:23:35.48 --> 01:23:43.96
I tell people he wasn't the most moral guy that I knew. But he was the the most ethical officer

1137
01:23:44.52 --> 01:23:52.76
I ever served with. What I mean by that is he never did anything for personal gain. He always

1138
01:23:52.76 --> 01:23:59.32
did things for the unit and for the soldiers. Okay. But did he have affairs and things like that?

1139
01:23:59.32 --> 01:24:05.56
Yeah. And he used to tell me he said, Mook, you know, I should have never married because my

1140
01:24:06.36 --> 01:24:12.84
loved this the army. You know, so he, he basically, he turned on the war college. He could have

1141
01:24:12.84 --> 01:24:18.12
gone to the war college. He turned it down because he said, hey, I'm on another battalion and be at

1142
01:24:18.12 --> 01:24:24.68
now. You know, I mean, he would have been a general. There's no question about it. He had he not stood

1143
01:24:24.68 --> 01:24:32.12
off, you know, when he was no six and, and, you know, he, I think he was the youngest O-6 at that time

1144
01:24:32.12 --> 01:24:40.20
in the army. But he was a guy who, who was, he was sensitive though and he took care. He did take

1145
01:24:40.20 --> 01:24:45.48
care of his family. In fact, I can say this now because it's, you know, I think statue limitations

1146
01:24:45.48 --> 01:24:50.44
might be gone. But, you know, in those days, you weren't, you weren't able to take a lot of cash out of

1147
01:24:50.44 --> 01:24:58.36
Vietnam, you know, and, and I basically, one day, he knew I was going back home. Oh, and by the way,

1148
01:24:58.36 --> 01:25:04.36
he did everything he could that convinced me to stay and to extend in Vietnam. Okay. He was,

1149
01:25:04.36 --> 01:25:12.28
he had moved down to be the senior advisors for the Arvan Airborne Division, which was really the

1150
01:25:12.28 --> 01:25:17.64
Palo scarter around Saigon. Okay. And he knew all my hot buttons. You have to understand,

1151
01:25:17.64 --> 01:25:25.72
I was a bachelor. Okay. This time, right? And, and, and the airborne, the Vietnamese airborne

1152
01:25:25.72 --> 01:25:32.68
wore special fatigues. They were like tiger fatigues and they had red burays. You know, and I'm

1153
01:25:32.68 --> 01:25:38.36
just this young stud guy who likes their uniforms. And he said, Mook, he said, why don't you come

1154
01:25:38.36 --> 01:25:46.12
down here and I'll make you the G1 advisor. That's the admin guy, right? And he said, but when you

1155
01:25:46.12 --> 01:25:51.64
come down, if you're an advisor for the Vietnamese airborne, you get jump-a. You know, so that's

1156
01:25:51.64 --> 01:25:59.96
extra money, right? And, and he said, and I'll give you two Arvan ours. You, because he knew I,

1157
01:25:59.96 --> 01:26:04.76
I wanted to go to Japan and see my relatives. So in six months, he said, I'll give you two Arvan

1158
01:26:04.76 --> 01:26:09.72
ours, right? So guys, you know, he's trying to move the, you know, the sun in the moon, they

1159
01:26:09.72 --> 01:26:16.20
get me to extend six months. And, and I said, sir, I appreciated it, but I had some close calls.

1160
01:26:16.20 --> 01:26:21.88
And I figured the next one would have Mook, Yam, or Ritten, that bullet would have Mook, Yam,

1161
01:26:21.88 --> 01:26:27.56
or Ritten, and I said, no thanks, you know, I appreciate it. But I'm out of here. So,

1162
01:26:27.56 --> 01:26:37.96
I love him. You know, you're talking about the way he was, you know, so, so pro army, and yet,

1163
01:26:39.56 --> 01:26:44.04
he would have be able to against the army in a way. And here's another thing from the book.

1164
01:26:45.80 --> 01:26:52.36
He says, what a mistake it was to listen to the generals of corporate HQ who were briefed only

1165
01:26:52.36 --> 01:27:00.44
in zero defect terms, and so far from the cutting edge, expected nothing less. It was amongst

1166
01:27:00.44 --> 01:27:07.24
the biggest mistakes of the war. The politicians only listen to these generals and the generals

1167
01:27:07.24 --> 01:27:16.20
only listen to themselves. Few people asked front line soldiers, the only ones who really knew.

1168
01:27:16.20 --> 01:27:24.36
Could you guys, or could you, could you a pretty close to him, could you sense that

1169
01:27:25.16 --> 01:27:29.56
his frustration with the army? Did he talk about it with you? Did he, how did he treat?

1170
01:27:30.60 --> 01:27:34.92
You know, that's a very hard thing for a leader to do. If you're, if you're senior leadership,

1171
01:27:34.92 --> 01:27:39.56
is telling you to do stuff that doesn't make sense or, but, you know, hey, we can get it done,

1172
01:27:39.56 --> 01:27:43.56
and we're going to do it. It's a hard line to walk to say, look, we support the chain.

1173
01:27:43.56 --> 01:27:46.28
Come on, this is what they're telling us to do. I'm going to spin it in a positive way. Everyone's

1174
01:27:46.28 --> 01:27:49.48
going to think that we're doing it for the right reasons, because if I say, hey, look,

1175
01:27:49.48 --> 01:27:53.40
move, here's what I want you to do, and it's, it's dumb, but we're getting told to do it anyways.

1176
01:27:53.40 --> 01:27:58.84
That's not a good way to lead. No. So he wouldn't say that. So he would, he would support the chain,

1177
01:27:58.84 --> 01:28:08.92
and he would, he would present it in the way in which, you know, he'd talk about the mission,

1178
01:28:08.92 --> 01:28:16.12
and he would make sure that he would accomplish the mission, but he would do it his way.

1179
01:28:17.72 --> 01:28:22.68
You know, you know, the phrase battlefield expediency. That's what we did all the time. You know,

1180
01:28:22.68 --> 01:28:26.68
I mean, it's good. What, you know, what are they going to do? Send us to Vietnam. We're already there.

1181
01:28:27.72 --> 01:28:32.20
You know, so, you know, we just did what we had to do. And, you know, I mean,

1182
01:28:32.20 --> 01:28:38.20
the stupid rules of engagement that we had, you know, where do you have to get approval to fire

1183
01:28:38.20 --> 01:28:44.28
on people, even though you're receiving fire, you know, and just nutty stuff, you know,

1184
01:28:44.28 --> 01:28:48.44
and we just say, hey, you know, we're going to do what we have to do. And that's what we did.

1185
01:28:51.88 --> 01:28:55.96
Here's when he, uh, when he took over the battalion, the following day,

1186
01:28:55.96 --> 01:29:01.24
took over the battalion from Lieutenant Colonel Franklin A. Hartle in a parade field exchange of command

1187
01:29:01.24 --> 01:29:05.72
in the middle of the Maycon Delta, what kind of war have I got myself into? I wondered.

1188
01:29:05.72 --> 01:29:10.92
A perfectly starched general, you was there having flown in for the occasion in his polished

1189
01:29:10.92 --> 01:29:15.48
choppers. There was other brass, too, and photographers, the American flag, the battalion,

1190
01:29:15.48 --> 01:29:20.20
colors, which were ceremoniously passed on to me. And all of this before the scrimgiest,

1191
01:29:20.20 --> 01:29:26.76
most spirulist assembly of soldiers I'd ever seen. Incredibly, none of the generals or

1192
01:29:26.76 --> 01:29:33.48
kernels seem to notice the slack condition of my new charges or their positions.

1193
01:29:33.48 --> 01:29:38.52
From the outset, I realized that to make this unit effective military force, I'd have to

1194
01:29:38.52 --> 01:29:43.88
implement about a thousand changes. So I figured we'd start with five a day, little things,

1195
01:29:43.88 --> 01:29:48.52
basic things like where your steel pot and cleaning carry your rifle at all times. And ammunition

1196
01:29:48.52 --> 01:29:55.000
will not be worn poncho via style. My first order was that darkness that come darkness,

1197
01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:00.60
the fire support base perimeter would pull back 300 meters. The troops instantly began to grumble

1198
01:30:00.60 --> 01:30:05.96
about this. But it was the next order that really began the muteness feeling within my hard

1199
01:30:05.96 --> 01:30:10.84
luck outfit. Anything you can't carry 24 hours a day is gone in the next chopper,

1200
01:30:10.84 --> 01:30:17.48
chopper, good by tents and pots and rock socks and food lockers. The bitching and moaning began

1201
01:30:17.48 --> 01:30:22.92
in earnest as piles and piles of junk mounted at the LZ to be whisked away by Chinook.

1202
01:30:22.92 --> 01:30:33.24
But I didn't care. I wasn't there to have them like me. Again, we already talked about this.

1203
01:30:34.68 --> 01:30:40.76
And this comes up a lot from a leadership perspective. Do you, is it more important?

1204
01:30:40.76 --> 01:30:44.12
Do you like doors? It's more important to be respected? Is it more important to?

1205
01:30:44.12 --> 01:30:48.84
And I actually had a guy ask me this question the other day. Is it more important to win

1206
01:30:48.84 --> 01:30:55.80
order be liked? And I said, well, those two things aren't mutually exclusive at all.

1207
01:30:55.80 --> 01:31:00.12
Right. You're absolutely correct. And they're not mutually exclusive.

1208
01:31:00.12 --> 01:31:08.36
You know, if you demonstrate to your soldiers that you care for them professionally,

1209
01:31:09.16 --> 01:31:14.60
that's you'll be liked. There's no question because they know that you're there for them.

1210
01:31:14.60 --> 01:31:21.64
And you know, you don't as as it said there, you know, you're not there to win a popularity contest.

1211
01:31:22.44 --> 01:31:27.72
You know, you're not there to be politically correct. You're there to accomplish your mission,

1212
01:31:27.72 --> 01:31:33.96
but also make sure that your guys come back. And I think I'm starting to tie together

1213
01:31:34.92 --> 01:31:40.68
something very clearly in my head right now. And that is, you're your number two rule of leadership,

1214
01:31:40.68 --> 01:31:48.44
which is caring. And I think if you care about your people and they see that you care about them,

1215
01:31:48.44 --> 01:31:53.32
that trumps the fact that you want them to do things the right way, because the reason you want them

1216
01:31:53.32 --> 01:31:55.96
to do the things the right way is because you care about them and it's going to keep alive.

1217
01:31:57.08 --> 01:32:05.48
Make you successful. Yeah, absolutely. You know, when I was a young officer, I,

1218
01:32:05.48 --> 01:32:12.12
well, no, I, that's him. When I was a company, after half worth left, we had another

1219
01:32:12.12 --> 01:32:19.24
battalion commander come in, right? And he wrote on my OER, all my career I had

1220
01:32:20.36 --> 01:32:28.92
max OERs really good stuff. But on this one, he wrote that, and I'll take this hit any day

1221
01:32:28.92 --> 01:32:38.04
the week. He said, I was too concerned for my troops sometimes. Wow. And then, and I said,

1222
01:32:38.04 --> 01:32:45.08
okay, I'll take that. Wow. That's, that's an interesting perspective. Yeah.

1223
01:32:46.76 --> 01:32:52.68
And, you know, this is one of those dichotomies as well, because one of the hardest things about being a

1224
01:32:52.68 --> 01:32:57.96
leader is obviously you care about your men so much and yet you are going to do things. You are

1225
01:32:57.96 --> 01:33:02.76
going to put them in situations that's going to put their lives at risks at risk. And that is

1226
01:33:02.76 --> 01:33:06.68
that is something that every leader has to, will least military leaders they have to

1227
01:33:08.12 --> 01:33:13.56
have to find a way to get a handle on that. Because you love your guys and you want to take

1228
01:33:13.56 --> 01:33:19.80
care of them. But you do have to do your mission. And that, that's one of the hardest things

1229
01:33:19.80 --> 01:33:29.40
to balance. Talking about the morality of war a little bit, this was a, and again, this is why,

1230
01:33:29.96 --> 01:33:34.44
you know, the story that I opened up with, you can see that one clearly had to do with, with

1231
01:33:36.12 --> 01:33:41.08
having moral dilemmas and having guilt because hackworth gave a guy an order and the guy

1232
01:33:41.08 --> 01:33:46.60
followed the order, maybe not the way hackworth thought he was, but the moral injury that he got from

1233
01:33:46.60 --> 01:33:50.68
that he said lasted his whole life of giving an order and somebody does something he didn't expect

1234
01:33:50.68 --> 01:33:55.96
to do him the end of getting killed. One of his guys, one of his guys that he loved gets killed because

1235
01:33:55.96 --> 01:34:03.80
of the way he led. Here's another kind of moral situation going back to the book.

1236
01:34:05.72 --> 01:34:11.64
They're flying around, they're on a mission. We went down to about 100 feet. The suspects were

1237
01:34:11.64 --> 01:34:18.28
still running, but this closer inspection confirmed my initial feeling. They were just eight kids,

1238
01:34:18.28 --> 01:34:25.32
no older than 13 or 14, simply scared shitless as they ran looking for cover, carrying neither

1239
01:34:25.32 --> 01:34:32.12
weapons nor military equipment. No, I told the pilot, I don't give you permission to fire. I'll

1240
01:34:32.12 --> 01:34:38.20
put an infantry insert on them. I instructed the platoon leader who's men were aboard the four

1241
01:34:38.20 --> 01:34:46.04
slicks where to land. With gunships covering the platoon hit the ground, the immediately received

1242
01:34:46.04 --> 01:34:52.92
small arms fire and took a couple of wounded. The little kids were as my savvy pilot had said

1243
01:34:52.92 --> 01:34:59.80
from the outset, the vehicle. It was a major lesson learned from me, but one impossible to

1244
01:34:59.80 --> 01:35:08.44
etch in stone. I had a couple of men wounded who would not have been if I just said to blow those kids away.

1245
01:35:08.60 --> 01:35:13.72
But I couldn't say blow them away because they appeared unarmed. Yes, they were VC,

1246
01:35:14.76 --> 01:35:19.08
but they could just as well have been kids ditching school who happened to get caught in the

1247
01:35:19.08 --> 01:35:25.88
crossfire. Anything was possible. And I suddenly realized it would not be easy this delta war.

1248
01:35:25.88 --> 01:35:30.60
It wasn't easy to tell the good guys from the bad guys anywhere in South Vietnam,

1249
01:35:30.60 --> 01:35:34.12
but here in the delta it was damn near impossible.

1250
01:35:39.24 --> 01:35:44.44
Again, very similar to what my guys dealt with over in the body was very hard to tell

1251
01:35:45.48 --> 01:35:49.56
who was good and who was bad and the enemy knew they could just put the you know drop the weapon

1252
01:35:49.56 --> 01:35:54.36
and walk away and now they were considered innocent even though 20 seconds prior to that they were

1253
01:35:54.36 --> 01:36:03.80
shooting. How did you keep your men from becoming so callous that they were just going to

1254
01:36:04.68 --> 01:36:10.28
start shooting kids because they suspected they were VC. How hard did you have to keep control of that?

1255
01:36:11.96 --> 01:36:19.16
Well, my response to that is the American soldier in Nate Lee is ethical.

1256
01:36:19.16 --> 01:36:29.24
It's in our culture not to shoot women and children. Now guys, you know if there

1257
01:36:31.48 --> 01:36:41.72
that might be something else, but we and we do not shoot civilians just

1258
01:36:41.72 --> 01:36:51.24
you know who are who are caught with you know we we run across them just because they're there

1259
01:36:52.12 --> 01:36:57.40
and we want to take revenge. We don't do that as an army. They're generally speaking. Now there are

1260
01:36:57.40 --> 01:37:04.84
times when people lose it and I understand that that's the stress of war that's happened in all

1261
01:37:04.84 --> 01:37:15.32
wars. I don't condone it but I can understand and so they answer your question. We really didn't

1262
01:37:15.32 --> 01:37:23.80
have to our guys are pretty professional and I was proud to start with them. I didn't I didn't

1263
01:37:23.80 --> 01:37:29.16
see any of that. Okay. Yeah, and this just tells me once again it's about leadership.

1264
01:37:29.16 --> 01:37:34.20
I mean because here you can see hack clearly leaning towards making sure he's doing the right thing

1265
01:37:34.20 --> 01:37:38.52
even though he's a guy that loves his troops and wants to take care of me. He still leans towards

1266
01:37:38.52 --> 01:37:42.52
doing the right thing and from what you're saying that filtered all the way through the chain of

1267
01:37:42.52 --> 01:37:48.84
command and we we took an in-depth look of actually done two podcasts concerning the Mealime

1268
01:37:48.84 --> 01:37:55.56
Asker and what happened there and it was just so clear that the leadership was completely at fault

1269
01:37:55.56 --> 01:38:01.08
and the way that they led those troops and it was when when I went through to try and pull

1270
01:38:01.08 --> 01:38:07.96
something positive out of the Mealime Asker the positive message that I got from it was that

1271
01:38:08.68 --> 01:38:13.24
it was one officer who had flown it was Thompson I believe his name was but he had flown over

1272
01:38:13.24 --> 01:38:17.88
heat scene what was happening he flew back to base told the senior leadership this is what's going

1273
01:38:17.88 --> 01:38:22.04
on in the ground the senior leadership radioed into the field and said stop killing people

1274
01:38:22.60 --> 01:38:27.72
and they they literally instantly stopped they stopped the massacre just because a leader

1275
01:38:27.72 --> 01:38:34.68
stepped up and said stop so good leadership completely changed the situation as it was ongoing

1276
01:38:34.68 --> 01:38:38.36
and clearly if there would have been a better leader on the ground that was leading in the right

1277
01:38:38.36 --> 01:38:45.000
way it never would have even started so you can see here from what Hacks saying the way he led

1278
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:51.40
and the way he treated unknown you know people and then the way that was carried out through the

1279
01:38:51.40 --> 01:38:57.64
whole battalion that's another amazing testament to good leadership. Yeah and and once

1280
01:38:57.64 --> 01:39:02.84
something about me lie which I tell people is that it was the exception to prove the rule

1281
01:39:03.88 --> 01:39:12.76
that United States military that that was an exception. Oh yeah you know the the rule in our

1282
01:39:12.76 --> 01:39:19.64
military as we don't we don't do that and that proved it I mean I didn't see you know there

1283
01:39:19.64 --> 01:39:27.000
were other armies there who were more ruthless like the like the rocks the rocks were not there

1284
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:31.24
they were the Republic of Korea they were not there the wind the hearts and minds of the people

1285
01:39:31.96 --> 01:39:38.20
they were there the wind the war so if they would go by a village and they were fired upon

1286
01:39:38.20 --> 01:39:44.12
they destroyed the village and after a while nobody fired on the rocks.

1287
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:56.84
When Hacks worth now gets wounded in the eighth time. Yeah it was you I thought you were

1288
01:39:56.84 --> 01:40:02.84
getting to that when you read that one quote but the way and I wasn't there with him when he

1289
01:40:02.84 --> 01:40:10.36
when he got his ace purple heart but I know the story and and basically there were guys

1290
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:17.16
who were in in bad shape and he lands the CNC in the middle and fact that might have been that

1291
01:40:17.16 --> 01:40:24.84
then maybe they they landed in the middle of a firefighter hacked it. He ordered the pilot to take

1292
01:40:24.84 --> 01:40:31.88
him down and he does put the wounded guys into the CNC well the CNC isn't that big you know there's

1293
01:40:31.88 --> 01:40:38.60
no room for heck so he stands on the skits and they take off and he gets hit in the lake and that

1294
01:40:38.60 --> 01:40:43.72
was the z-purple heart well after that you know he could tell the guys in the battalion I want

1295
01:40:43.72 --> 01:40:49.80
you to walk through this wall of fire and the response would be where do you want us to go you know

1296
01:40:49.80 --> 01:40:55.32
he he led by example but is that what caused the army you say okay we're gonna

1297
01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:00.04
did they pull did they pull them from the battalion at that point when he got his eight

1298
01:41:00.04 --> 01:41:04.60
purple heart pretty much that was that was it because well if you got three purple hearts you

1299
01:41:04.60 --> 01:41:10.12
went home was that was that the deal I don't know I only had one but I have no idea but you know they

1300
01:41:10.12 --> 01:41:16.60
they basically said you know we can't afford the luge you I mean if they you know if you get killed I

1301
01:41:16.60 --> 01:41:23.64
mean that's a big hit on just a morale and you know and so you're out of your out of there in the

1302
01:41:23.64 --> 01:41:33.48
field okay so he went up to play crew to become the deputy he was the G3 core advisor for two core

1303
01:41:34.12 --> 01:41:40.04
okay which was the central highlands and when my company was pulled out of Vietnam and I'd be

1304
01:41:40.04 --> 01:41:46.28
fused to go and I said hey I want to stay here I called half and I said sir you know I don't really

1305
01:41:46.28 --> 01:41:53.40
want to go back can you use me I had orders the next day to go to play crew and then you went

1306
01:41:53.40 --> 01:42:00.20
up to play crew and you start you guys were doing advising for the yeah we we were the we were the

1307
01:42:00.20 --> 01:42:12.04
Mac V that's a military assistance command Vietnam people and I had there was a close call that I had

1308
01:42:12.04 --> 01:42:21.000
when this was another moral injury thing by the way which I really had really buried and not

1309
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:29.64
really thought a lot about it but we we had an inspection team that went out on the special forces

1310
01:42:29.64 --> 01:42:37.08
camps on the border of Cambodia and Lowes and Vietnam and you had pleasure rain Ben had doctor

1311
01:42:38.44 --> 01:42:46.36
in the central highlands and so we would fly into these camps and there were three people on this

1312
01:42:46.36 --> 01:42:53.08
inspection team so to speak it was the deputy core advisor who was an o6 a full kernel you know

1313
01:42:53.08 --> 01:43:00.92
big deal there was the command sergeant major highest ranking and listed advisor also a big deal

1314
01:43:00.92 --> 01:43:07.80
and I was the young captain okay carrying everybody's bags no takers yeah right so so we land on

1315
01:43:07.80 --> 01:43:17.32
this special forces camp and we come under attack and the sergeant major is killed and he was maybe

1316
01:43:17.32 --> 01:43:23.64
20 meters away from me it was a rocket and it was just he was in the wrong place you know it could have

1317
01:43:23.64 --> 01:43:31.08
been me if I was you know if it had come in the other direction well the backside of that story

1318
01:43:31.08 --> 01:43:40.84
is that he was scheduled to go on R and R the next day to Hawaii to meet his waiting wife

1319
01:43:40.84 --> 01:43:50.92
to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary okay now I was just a young captain but I

1320
01:43:50.92 --> 01:43:59.72
out ranked him okay I could have ordered him not to go on that mission why risk it you know

1321
01:43:59.72 --> 01:44:06.92
because he he was going to meet his wife the next day I didn't do that okay and I I've thought about

1322
01:44:06.92 --> 01:44:15.64
that in terms of survivor guilt and and all of that it was and that's something that's come up in my

1323
01:44:16.68 --> 01:44:25.32
you know my studying this moral injury stuff. At this point did you you're so now you're

1324
01:44:25.32 --> 01:44:34.04
working with hackworth directly and are you starting to sense his frustration about the war at all?

1325
01:44:34.04 --> 01:44:44.36
Yeah a little bit yeah well no more than a little bit because the the G3 for the core was

1326
01:44:45.08 --> 01:44:54.52
fairly corrupt guy and hackworth was very frustrated with that and that's why he loved actually

1327
01:44:54.52 --> 01:45:04.84
well let's backtrack I yeah he he was moved down to the Vietnamese airborne because he really

1328
01:45:05.80 --> 01:45:12.20
was not happy I think he might have been moved I never really got the story on that why he went down there

1329
01:45:13.32 --> 01:45:18.28
and now at this point what's your what are you thinking about in your career in your life?

1330
01:45:18.28 --> 01:45:24.36
Oh I already decided I was designing when I got back to the States and what made you what made you

1331
01:45:24.36 --> 01:45:31.56
lean in that direction because I mean you did more years in JRTC than anyone I was ever done before

1332
01:45:31.56 --> 01:45:37.16
that did you did RRTC and you had all that military stuff and now you got your combat torn Vietnam under

1333
01:45:37.48 --> 01:45:43.80
what what tilted you in the other direction? I felt the army was going in the wrong direction

1334
01:45:43.80 --> 01:45:52.52
when it came to leadership I thought that they were looking for managers and not commanders

1335
01:45:53.96 --> 01:46:01.32
I was in some positions during my career right had access to officer deficiency reports

1336
01:46:02.12 --> 01:46:09.16
and I could see were the ratings of the senior officers that lieutenant colonels and the

1337
01:46:09.16 --> 01:46:19.64
battalion commanders were the tendency was to give the managers high ratings irrespective of their

1338
01:46:20.84 --> 01:46:28.04
command abilities and and then my personal career was was not managed very well

1339
01:46:29.24 --> 01:46:35.000
the hack worth hack worth wanted me to stay he knew I was I was thinking of resigning and the

1340
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.88
fact that's why he offered me the company because you know he thought that experience might turn

1341
01:46:39.88 --> 01:46:46.44
things around you know and so I'm here I am at still with hack worth in the battalion right

1342
01:46:46.44 --> 01:46:52.84
and he contacted his friends at the Pentagon and he said listen you guys we got a stud here

1343
01:46:52.84 --> 01:46:59.24
and he's thinking of leaving you know show him some personal attention we got a chance to save

1344
01:46:59.24 --> 01:47:04.36
him you know he told me this later and so I get this letter from the Pentagon you know

1345
01:47:04.36 --> 01:47:10.12
I'm on the middle of nowhere you know and I first letter they'd ever sent me and they said

1346
01:47:10.12 --> 01:47:18.76
they're a camp in mochuyama we have reviewed your 201 file very carefully right and we believe

1347
01:47:19.56 --> 01:47:27.000
you have promised for graduate school okay only problem is I already had my master's

1348
01:47:28.12 --> 01:47:33.16
which means that they didn't really pay a lot of attention right there review I showed the letter

1349
01:47:33.16 --> 01:47:38.36
to hack and I said hey you know I mean this is crazy you know I'm gonna put my career in the hands of

1350
01:47:38.36 --> 01:47:44.44
these guys you know and that pretty well sealed it for me and so did you did you submit your

1351
01:47:44.44 --> 01:47:49.40
resignation while you were a stone Vietnam or to come home as soon as I came home I did I wanted to

1352
01:47:49.40 --> 01:47:57.24
finish the tour and be at which I did and then I told the army I'm I'm gonna be out of here you know

1353
01:47:57.24 --> 01:48:03.96
and so they assigned me to Fort Charonan Illinois right because I lived in Chicago and I finished I

1354
01:48:03.96 --> 01:48:10.36
have three months there and then I was done and then did you at what point did you decide you're

1355
01:48:10.36 --> 01:48:15.80
gonna stay in the reserves? Oh immediately okay that was never a question okay I was committed to

1356
01:48:15.80 --> 01:48:23.000
doing 20 years turn out to be 32 but I you know I was committed to doing 20 because especially

1357
01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:30.28
at that time in 70 71 the reserve components didn't have a lot of combat experience guys

1358
01:48:31.32 --> 01:48:38.52
and I felt that it was important that I tried to help you know the reserves be ready

1359
01:48:39.40 --> 01:48:46.20
basically and I had something to contribute so that's why I joined the reserves and then you start

1360
01:48:46.20 --> 01:48:54.44
on your civilian career as well yeah and what happened there was I I worked for a Japanese

1361
01:48:54.44 --> 01:49:01.000
importing and exporting company it's a color trading company and it was a name of company was

1362
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:07.56
Mitsui and companies world we know we used to have a saying that the sun never set on Mitsui

1363
01:49:07.88 --> 01:49:13.96
because they had offices in like 165 countries okay and it was a very prestigious

1364
01:49:13.96 --> 01:49:20.92
company if anybody they had quote unquote Mitsui men you know if you were a Mitsui guy that was

1365
01:49:20.92 --> 01:49:26.60
a big deal it was like their Harvard graduates would all go there you know and things like that and

1366
01:49:26.60 --> 01:49:34.44
I was at the Chicago office and the problem was I actually experienced reverse discrimination

1367
01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:42.92
by that what I mean is that I had studied Japanese history, political science and Japanese language a

1368
01:49:42.92 --> 01:49:51.32
little bit at the University of Illinois okay and I had a pretty good work ethic okay and

1369
01:49:52.12 --> 01:49:58.36
but they couldn't it couldn't compute in their mind that I'm talking about the Japanese okay

1370
01:49:58.36 --> 01:50:05.16
all the manager positions were Japanese like the branch manager he was a vice president you know

1371
01:50:05.16 --> 01:50:14.20
and all that I had no opportunity to ever get to even to be a department manager in that company

1372
01:50:14.76 --> 01:50:22.84
because they looked at me and they couldn't compute that I didn't speak Japanese fluently okay so

1373
01:50:22.84 --> 01:50:29.72
in their mind I'm the village idiot you know even though I have my masters degree I had commanded

1374
01:50:29.72 --> 01:50:35.64
a company in combat I had signed for $10 million worth of equipment I had more responsibility and

1375
01:50:35.64 --> 01:50:41.32
life than these guys will ever know you know but they didn't get it they didn't understand that so

1376
01:50:41.32 --> 01:50:47.32
I did that for about five years I mean I was treated well I have no complaints but you know

1377
01:50:47.32 --> 01:50:55.32
I didn't expect any guarantees but I had hoped I would have an opportunity to compete

1378
01:50:55.32 --> 01:51:03.72
and when I saw that wasn't that wasn't gonna happen I had a roommate from the U of I who was

1379
01:51:03.72 --> 01:51:10.20
a member of the Chicago Board Options Exchange and options trading was just starting at that time

1380
01:51:10.92 --> 01:51:21.56
and he he was a great visionary little weak on details and so he had an operation on the floor of

1381
01:51:21.56 --> 01:51:28.04
the exchange and he realized he needed to get a handle on that and I'm pretty good with details so

1382
01:51:28.04 --> 01:51:33.40
he called me and he said Jim I know you're not happy you know where you're at which you want to

1383
01:51:33.40 --> 01:51:40.20
come work with me and and I said hey wait a second you know I don't have one day of finance formal

1384
01:51:40.20 --> 01:51:45.000
education I didn't know the difference between a stock and a bond you know must

1385
01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:51.08
for less a stock option and he said don't worry about it I know your abilities you're good with math

1386
01:51:51.64 --> 01:51:57.64
you know this is not rocket science is stuff and I said okay I'll do it and that started out

1387
01:51:57.64 --> 01:52:04.12
of 35 year career in financial services industry and I became a member of the New York Stock Exchange

1388
01:52:04.12 --> 01:52:10.60
the Chicago Board Options Exchange I was very blessed I became part-owner of the company so that

1389
01:52:10.60 --> 01:52:17.40
enabled me to devote all the time I did in the reserves that I did because I was part of the deal

1390
01:52:17.40 --> 01:52:24.12
I made with my friend I said listen if you want me to join you I'm bringing the reserves with me

1391
01:52:24.76 --> 01:52:31.08
and you have to understand you know if I'm called I'm going and if I'm in the reserves I'm going to

1392
01:52:31.08 --> 01:52:37.88
give it a hundred percent you know and but he was he had gone through our T.C. with me okay so he was

1393
01:52:37.88 --> 01:52:44.92
he was an army officer so he understood so I was able to have a successful career at the same time

1394
01:52:44.92 --> 01:52:52.84
and you moved up really quickly through the ranks and the reserves yeah I had I had like like I said

1395
01:52:52.84 --> 01:53:00.68
before Jack I had great N.C.O.s who made me look good I had commanders who mentored me I was I was a

1396
01:53:00.68 --> 01:53:07.08
Brigadier General at the age of 42 and I was a major General three years later I was the youngest

1397
01:53:07.08 --> 01:53:16.20
General in the army at the time so yeah I was I was challenged I had great assignments and so

1398
01:53:17.32 --> 01:53:22.76
I was very blessed and my wife supported me through all of this without her I would not have

1399
01:53:23.16 --> 01:53:29.32
been able to get the first base I noticed you you mentioned a couple times a general William Levine

1400
01:53:29.32 --> 01:53:36.04
yes and and so the impact that he had on you he was a guy that landed a D.D. Utah beach and

1401
01:53:36.76 --> 01:53:42.12
was one of the people that liberated Doc Ow and in World War II yes was there any

1402
01:53:42.84 --> 01:53:49.32
significant lesson learned that he passed on to you there absolutely he he I think he's

1403
01:53:49.32 --> 01:53:57.40
personally responsible for that balance part of my leadership concept that I've developed over my career

1404
01:53:57.40 --> 01:54:04.28
uh he really emphasized family and and keep in mind when I joined the reserves I didn't have a

1405
01:54:04.28 --> 01:54:09.64
clue about the citizen soldier you know those of us on air to duty what do we know about the

1406
01:54:09.64 --> 01:54:14.52
garden reserves and their pressure you know what they do with you know people in the garden

1407
01:54:14.52 --> 01:54:21.000
reserves have to balance three balls at the same time right you you've got your your family you've

1408
01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:26.60
got your civilian career that puts bread and butter on the table and then you've got the reserve

1409
01:54:26.60 --> 01:54:33.32
so the guard you know what you know and so you're balancing all that stuff and general Levine

1410
01:54:33.32 --> 01:54:41.40
always remember emphasized the family he always made sure that we were aware of

1411
01:54:43.16 --> 01:54:48.92
the stresses on the family you know when we were gone I'll never forget a microrear

1412
01:54:49.72 --> 01:54:54.84
without fail that's when the furnace would break down that's when we'd have a blizzard so my

1413
01:54:54.84 --> 01:55:01.000
95 pound wife would have to go out there and shovel the snow because I wasn't there you know our

1414
01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:08.44
son Jay who's who you know he he basically was a rascal when he was a young guy and my

1415
01:55:08.44 --> 01:55:13.72
might have to take him to the emergency room in the hospital like three times I don't even know where

1416
01:55:13.72 --> 01:55:20.60
it's time's a week and I don't even know where it's at you know because I wasn't home so you know

1417
01:55:20.60 --> 01:55:28.44
the stresses and stuff so he really drove that home and I understood better the stresses on the

1418
01:55:28.44 --> 01:55:33.64
citizen soldier which are tremendous you know at least when you're on active duty you're focused

1419
01:55:33.64 --> 01:55:39.64
you know and you're in a community where everybody is going through the same thing so they all

1420
01:55:39.64 --> 01:55:45.32
understand you know the stresses on the marriage they you know they sure things they can help each other

1421
01:55:45.32 --> 01:55:52.92
out but then to be serves in guard you know the rest of the you go to a meeting one week in a month

1422
01:55:53.48 --> 01:56:00.44
you know and unless you're in leadership you know that's about it and you know you don't have the

1423
01:56:00.44 --> 01:56:06.36
you don't have the bonding and the community strength that you do when you're on active duty

1424
01:56:06.92 --> 01:56:12.12
yeah when we got to Ramadi it was the 228 National Guard Unit out of Pennsylvania and reserve units

1425
01:56:12.12 --> 01:56:16.76
that were all in the ground and they'd been there for I think they'd been there for 14 months

1426
01:56:16.76 --> 01:56:22.28
but boy they were outstanding soldiers all of them it was a real honor to work with them a little

1427
01:56:22.28 --> 01:56:30.12
bit and then get the turnover and great guys they you ran you ended up running training for like

1428
01:56:30.12 --> 01:56:37.000
21 out of your 25 years in the reserves that's that's that's a lot of training to run

1429
01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:42.92
yeah I was and once again I'd say you've heard me say this before it's a god thing

1430
01:56:44.60 --> 01:56:50.52
basically the army was the only service that really had a great

1431
01:56:53.72 --> 01:57:02.36
process where we had reserve units whose wartime mission was to take over the training centers

1432
01:57:02.36 --> 01:57:08.60
you know like the great lakes naval training center you know but the Navy didn't have that the

1433
01:57:08.60 --> 01:57:13.80
Air Force didn't have that the Marines didn't have that we had reserve units that their wartime

1434
01:57:13.80 --> 01:57:19.88
mission was to go to Fort Benning for example that was my division mission was to go to Fort Benning

1435
01:57:19.88 --> 01:57:25.24
and take over the training of the infantry officers and recruit not officers to recruit

1436
01:57:25.24 --> 01:57:33.000
at Fort Benning so that the active duty soldiers that were already there who were up to speed on everything

1437
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:40.12
you know could go join fighting units basically so that was that was the mission all right so

1438
01:57:40.12 --> 01:57:45.40
I joined when I came off of active duty I joined the 85th training division in Chicago

1439
01:57:46.20 --> 01:57:52.52
and that was an infantry training division at the time and I was with them for 18 years

1440
01:57:52.52 --> 01:58:00.52
and I commanded at the company level battalion level brigade level and I was the assistant division

1441
01:58:00.52 --> 01:58:08.68
commander and every year we would go on annual training to a active duty training

1442
01:58:09.88 --> 01:58:15.64
for it and we take over the training of the recruits so I did it at Dix I did it at Fort Bliss

1443
01:58:15.64 --> 01:58:23.16
I did it at Fort Ord and then finally with the 70th I did it at Fort Benning and so

1444
01:58:25.08 --> 01:58:34.12
then what happened was I I was the commander of the 70th division out of L'Avonium Michigan

1445
01:58:34.68 --> 01:58:40.84
and desert storm came okay and I knew we were going to be mobilized

1446
01:58:40.84 --> 01:58:49.88
and the handwriting was on the wall okay so I put together a list I had 16 subordinate units

1447
01:58:49.88 --> 01:58:57.24
in my I had three brigades in the training command and other things and so I made a list

1448
01:58:57.24 --> 01:59:08.44
of one-to-16 and I prioritized them okay and it was a mixture of readiness and leadership

1449
01:59:08.44 --> 01:59:12.68
you know that's how I prioritized them and I also had to be sensitive to

1450
01:59:13.96 --> 01:59:21.08
I had units in Indiana and Michigan so I couldn't take all the Michigan units and leave out Indiana guys

1451
01:59:21.08 --> 01:59:24.76
that wouldn't have been fair because everybody wanted to be mobilized

1452
01:59:25.88 --> 01:59:31.000
okay you have to understand this was this is when this would be the first time

1453
01:59:31.56 --> 01:59:35.48
okay and we've been practicing for like 25 years

1454
01:59:35.48 --> 01:59:41.24
you know you're ready for game day yeah so the question is if the balloon went up would people show

1455
01:59:41.24 --> 01:59:46.04
out you know and so so I had this list and I went to trade-ock which was our

1456
01:59:47.80 --> 01:59:54.52
higher headquarters at Fort Benning Robe Virginia and I said listen here's my list here's my division

1457
01:59:54.52 --> 02:00:02.28
okay I said use this list and if you're going to mobilize my division or any part of my division

1458
02:00:02.28 --> 02:00:11.64
do it in this order and don't screw with this this is the best way this is the best way my division

1459
02:00:11.64 --> 02:00:19.08
will serve you know the army did they comply oh yeah they were delighted it was awesome

1460
02:00:19.08 --> 02:00:24.60
I was the only division commander that had done that so they went out to the other 11 division

1461
02:00:24.60 --> 02:00:30.60
commanders and they hey say we need some lists you know and they did exactly what I told them

1462
02:00:30.60 --> 02:00:35.56
they do because they mobilized half of my division so they just went right down the list you know

1463
02:00:35.56 --> 02:00:41.48
down to eight or nine and that was it you know now you ended up having kind of a run in at the

1464
02:00:41.48 --> 02:00:50.68
end of your career yeah I had several you know it was because of half worth you know about face

1465
02:00:50.68 --> 02:01:03.56
and and and the first one was I went on the Oprah Winfrey show and basically my mom was still

1466
02:01:03.56 --> 02:01:09.000
alive at that time she used to watch Oprah during the day and Oprah was out of Chicago right

1467
02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:14.92
and and then she and she used to and I didn't know this because I never watched it but she used to

1468
02:01:14.92 --> 02:01:21.88
announce a head of time subjects that she was going to cover and if anybody knew anyone who

1469
02:01:21.88 --> 02:01:27.48
were experts in that area let her know you know so she could get them so she decided this is

1470
02:01:27.48 --> 02:01:34.04
in the late eighties okay now put yourself back at that time when the economy was not doing so hot

1471
02:01:34.04 --> 02:01:40.44
and the Japanese economy was doing real good you know because of their computers their automobiles

1472
02:01:40.44 --> 02:01:49.08
their televisions and so people were blaming the Japanese about our poor economic situation

1473
02:01:49.80 --> 02:01:57.000
and it was called Japan bashing and so in fact there was a Chinese guy's name was Victor Chen

1474
02:01:57.80 --> 02:02:05.000
who was killed and Detroit by some automobile workers with baseball bats because they thought he

1475
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:12.60
was Japanese he was actually Chinese okay so open decided they have a show about Japan bashing

1476
02:02:13.16 --> 02:02:18.60
so she said if anybody knows anyone you know the Japanese American community what might be a good

1477
02:02:19.32 --> 02:02:25.08
you know person on this please let me know well my mom saw that and she said you need to get on

1478
02:02:25.08 --> 02:02:31.56
the show you know so I tried calling I couldn't get you know how this is you know I couldn't get

1479
02:02:31.56 --> 02:02:38.12
through whatever well I have a very I had at that time a very influential journalist in Chicago

1480
02:02:38.12 --> 02:02:46.44
his name was Irv Cupsinet who had a very famous if's called Cups column he used to interview

1481
02:02:46.44 --> 02:02:55.80
presidents kings and queens political people you know at in Chicago at a restaurant and so

1482
02:02:55.80 --> 02:03:01.16
so I called Cups and I said hey Cups you know I'm trying to get through and this thing was Oprah

1483
02:03:01.88 --> 02:03:08.04
and and he said I'll see what I can do okay two hours later I get a call from the executive

1484
02:03:08.60 --> 02:03:15.32
producer the show and and he says I understand that you're a general in the army I said yeah I'm

1485
02:03:15.64 --> 02:03:21.40
in the army of deserves and and that you're the highest ranking Asian American in our armed forces

1486
02:03:21.40 --> 02:03:27.08
today and I said yeah that's right and he said well and and I I was trying to figure out where

1487
02:03:27.08 --> 02:03:31.88
the guy was going right well he was trying to see if I could chew gum and walk at the same time

1488
02:03:32.44 --> 02:03:37.88
so once he figured I could do that he said you know we'd like to have you on the show okay

1489
02:03:37.88 --> 02:03:45.56
so I said fine when is it tomorrow okay so I said okay I'm in so I called my at that time I was

1490
02:03:45.56 --> 02:03:51.32
working for a New York Stock Exchange firm and I called the headquarters in New York I said hey I needed

1491
02:03:51.32 --> 02:03:57.24
a day off so they gave it to me and then I called the chief of army reserves office because

1492
02:03:57.24 --> 02:04:03.48
keep in mind I'm a two-star general right and I said hey I'm going on the Oprah show you know

1493
02:04:04.12 --> 02:04:10.36
and what's the subject well the subject is Japan bashing but I'm being invited because you know I'm

1494
02:04:11.08 --> 02:04:17.48
high ranking Japanese American in our army and I'm gonna wear my uniform you know so

1495
02:04:17.48 --> 02:04:25.48
I get a call back okay from the chief of public affairs of the army now he's a one-star

1496
02:04:25.48 --> 02:04:31.88
okay and I'm a two-star okay so he calls and he said I understand you're gonna be on the

1497
02:04:31.88 --> 02:04:38.52
open show yeah it's right what's the subject Japan bashing oh it's not about the army no it's

1498
02:04:38.52 --> 02:04:43.96
not about the military at all but I'm being invited because I'm the highest ranking Japanese

1499
02:04:43.96 --> 02:04:51.56
American in the army in the military you'll hold military and being in O8 at the time and he said well

1500
02:04:52.12 --> 02:05:00.92
then we don't want you to wear your uniform okay and I said listen I take my responsibility very

1501
02:05:00.92 --> 02:05:09.32
seriously as a role model from minorities this is a great opportunity to let people know

1502
02:05:09.32 --> 02:05:19.24
that we have equal opportunity in our armed forces I don't see this as a as a possibility to fail I see

1503
02:05:19.24 --> 02:05:25.64
this is an opportunity to succeed and I and I just said I you know I don't really have a lot of

1504
02:05:25.64 --> 02:05:31.88
time for this because it was going to be the next day right so I said is this in order you know

1505
02:05:31.88 --> 02:05:38.92
from you know the secretary or from the chief I don't care you know whoever's above me is this in order

1506
02:05:39.88 --> 02:05:45.08
and he said well I can't tell you it's in order and I said well okay in that case thank you very

1507
02:05:45.08 --> 02:05:52.20
much for calling me you know I appreciate what you said I've taken it all in under consideration

1508
02:05:52.84 --> 02:05:58.44
bottom line I'm wearing my uniform and that was the end of it okay so he writes a memorandum for

1509
02:05:58.44 --> 02:06:05.48
record that to the chief of staff at the army that went into my file that said you know I spoke to

1510
02:06:05.48 --> 02:06:11.64
John Wilmingham I told him it was you know above his paid rate levels and he might get involved with

1511
02:06:12.20 --> 02:06:17.08
you know things that went out of hand and all that and he basically told me that he was going

1512
02:06:17.08 --> 02:06:25.000
to wear his uniform so so I go on the show okay and I'm ready I do my homework okay and

1513
02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:31.40
we come out from commercial break and Oprah starts out by saying and today we have with us major

1514
02:06:31.40 --> 02:06:39.64
general Jim Mukwoyama the highest ranking Asian American Japanese American in our military today

1515
02:06:40.20 --> 02:06:45.48
camera and I'm going to sit there in the civilian suit I mean what kind of a message with that

1516
02:06:45.48 --> 02:06:52.12
it was I was in my class eight of course okay so and the first words out of my mouth were

1517
02:06:52.12 --> 02:07:00.68
Oprah I want everyone to understand that whatever I say today is the opinion of Jim Mukwoyama

1518
02:07:00.68 --> 02:07:06.20
I am not representing the department of the army I'm not representing the department of the

1519
02:07:06.20 --> 02:07:13.72
defense however I am a soldier in the United States Army I'm proud of it we have equal opportunity

1520
02:07:13.72 --> 02:07:21.32
in our armed forces end of message and the rest of the thing went very well and they actually had

1521
02:07:21.32 --> 02:07:27.24
a guy on there who I would affectionately refer to as a redneck and he was blaming the Japanese for

1522
02:07:27.24 --> 02:07:34.76
all the problems and some of it was correct where they weren't fair in some of the economic

1523
02:07:34.76 --> 02:07:41.24
dealings with us you know there were there markets were not as open to our products as they

1524
02:07:41.24 --> 02:07:46.84
should have been but on the other hand it got was saying some nutty stuff like he said well they're

1525
02:07:46.84 --> 02:07:54.76
costing us jobs okay so I said okay who's the fourth largest law automobile manufacturer in the country

1526
02:07:55.32 --> 02:08:03.64
the answer Honda America okay they have a plant in Mary'sville Ohio that employed 3500

1527
02:08:04.20 --> 02:08:12.04
Americans okay they can't close that plan and take it back to Japan it's in the United States

1528
02:08:12.04 --> 02:08:18.44
and I said I'm also tired of hearing people complaining about American quality because the Honda

1529
02:08:18.44 --> 02:08:24.92
Syviks produced a debt plant have fewer defects than Honda Syviks that were coming from Japan

1530
02:08:24.92 --> 02:08:33.72
well JD powers I had I had all this already don't mess with the general so then I told them I said

1531
02:08:33.72 --> 02:08:44.12
and guess what the steel for that plant comes from a Indiana which is also jobs for Americans okay

1532
02:08:44.12 --> 02:08:50.76
then the other thing the guy said was the the the Asians are taking over our universities

1533
02:08:51.32 --> 02:08:57.64
I said what's that all about and he said well they're getting all the scholarships okay and I said listen

1534
02:08:57.64 --> 02:09:07.96
the Asian Americans are not smarter than any other ethnicity or race the reason they do so

1535
02:09:07.96 --> 02:09:14.68
well in school is the parents get involved and they make sure that their kids study and they

1536
02:09:14.68 --> 02:09:23.000
emphasize the value of education that kind of huge approval from the audience you know so what happened was

1537
02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:32.44
there was a believe it or not a federal judge in Chicago who saw that program okay so he writes a letter

1538
02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:38.68
to the secretary of defense saying you know let's I saw the Oprah show and there was this

1539
02:09:38.68 --> 02:09:45.88
major general Jim Moquillama who really did a great job for you guys and you guys should be proud of him right

1540
02:09:45.88 --> 02:09:53.24
so the secretary defense at that time was Dick Cheney okay so he endorses the letter down to the

1541
02:09:53.24 --> 02:09:58.92
secretary of the army the secretary of the army endorses the letter down to the chief of staff at the

1542
02:09:58.92 --> 02:10:06.92
army so when that hits my file same time the other thing hit my file basically one cancel the other

1543
02:10:06.92 --> 02:10:13.40
did you send a photo copy of that back to me yeah that's not me yeah but that's you know so right

1544
02:10:13.40 --> 02:10:19.48
then and there the army knew what they were dealing with because I you know I was you know it was

1545
02:10:19.48 --> 02:10:26.36
an opportunity to show that we have equal opportunity and he armed forces I tell people that

1546
02:10:27.32 --> 02:10:33.32
one of the proudest things of my service was that when I was loose track of people's race

1547
02:10:34.20 --> 02:10:39.48
you know I stopped looking at people as as Asian American or African American and in

1548
02:10:39.48 --> 02:10:46.12
or Hispanic Americans I looked at them as private or full lieutenant whatever their job was

1549
02:10:47.08 --> 02:10:52.52
in the military that's how I caught myself forgetting sometimes of people you know because I tell

1550
02:10:52.52 --> 02:11:01.08
people everybody was all of drab. Yeah yeah so that was my first the first. Now you started to say

1551
02:11:01.08 --> 02:11:06.36
that the book the book did the book start to play any kind of role in your career did people start

1552
02:11:06.36 --> 02:11:15.48
talking about hackworth's book. No not really that that read I when I mean by that is you know the

1553
02:11:15.48 --> 02:11:21.80
whole stance that he took about Vietnam to risk his career and just actually just saying hey I'm

1554
02:11:21.80 --> 02:11:28.60
out of here because you know I've done this now for 30 something years and frankly it was weighing

1555
02:11:28.60 --> 02:11:34.28
on him let me talk about the moral injury of knowing that you're leading soldiers in combat when

1556
02:11:34.28 --> 02:11:41.40
they could have been the policy could have been done better which would have resulted in fewer

1557
02:11:41.40 --> 02:11:47.24
casualties. Yeah that's I don't know if there's a heavier weight to bear than that that's a

1558
02:11:47.24 --> 02:11:53.40
heavy one and then what was the next thing you took a stance on? Well the next thing that happened

1559
02:11:53.40 --> 02:11:59.80
which caused the end of my career basically is I like that you say that with a smile on your face.

1560
02:11:59.80 --> 02:12:07.72
Well I'm I don't regret a day. If I had to do it again today I do it in a heartbeat and here's

1561
02:12:07.72 --> 02:12:15.64
what happened was I was an army reserve guy so for full transparency to your listeners okay I was

1562
02:12:15.64 --> 02:12:22.36
on active duty for five years I was on an army reserveist for 27 years okay now the army has

1563
02:12:22.36 --> 02:12:31.08
three components they have the active component they have the army reserve and they have the army

1564
02:12:31.08 --> 02:12:39.40
national guard okay the army reserve and army national guard are the so-called reserve components okay

1565
02:12:40.04 --> 02:12:50.04
now the active army of course are the 24-7 that's their full-time job the army reserves are a federal

1566
02:12:50.04 --> 02:12:58.20
force and the army reserves fall into the normal army chain of command the partner of the army

1567
02:12:58.20 --> 02:13:07.24
we answer to the orders of the president okay army national guard does not fall into that

1568
02:13:07.24 --> 02:13:14.04
chain of command nor do they be poured to the president they be poured to the governors of each state

1569
02:13:14.04 --> 02:13:24.76
it's really a state organization although 95% of their budget comes from the federal government okay

1570
02:13:26.36 --> 02:13:35.40
and as an army reserveist for 25 years 27 years I saw whenever it came to

1571
02:13:35.40 --> 02:13:45.16
a reducing the army force structure the army reserves would always get the short end and the

1572
02:13:45.16 --> 02:13:50.76
guard would always be protected okay the actors would always take care of themselves that was never

1573
02:13:50.76 --> 02:13:58.20
an issue okay but the so-called one army concept where everybody's supposed to be together in this

1574
02:13:58.84 --> 02:14:04.44
the reserves always got the short end of the stick and the reason for that is the reserves were

1575
02:14:04.44 --> 02:14:13.56
a national force okay we were professional in you know in the military as as you know

1576
02:14:14.52 --> 02:14:20.12
you're not supposed to be political you're supposed to be a political right not involved in

1577
02:14:20.12 --> 02:14:28.28
lobbying and stuff like that the national guard is very political it's jobs for the state

1578
02:14:28.28 --> 02:14:37.40
okay so whenever there's the national guard has so much political cloud if you look at any

1579
02:14:38.60 --> 02:14:45.72
presidential election just watch the week before the election in November that's when the guard normally

1580
02:14:45.72 --> 02:14:56.04
has their national convention in DC okay and I can tell you every major presidential candidate

1581
02:14:56.04 --> 02:15:05.48
shows up okay and and keep in mind they have the political support of a governor two senators

1582
02:15:05.48 --> 02:15:12.52
and the congressman right the army reserve doesn't have that political cloud so frankly we've

1583
02:15:12.52 --> 02:15:19.24
always gotten gotten screwed and so I I watched that for 25 years I said enough is enough

1584
02:15:19.24 --> 02:15:27.72
and so I I found that a 501c3 organization called the army reserve association which was comprised

1585
02:15:27.72 --> 02:15:36.60
of officers enlisted and civilians the mission was to educate the public and congress

1586
02:15:36.60 --> 02:15:41.40
about the army reserves because people when they think of they hear of the reserves they think of the

1587
02:15:41.40 --> 02:15:47.72
national guard they don't think of the army reserves which has armories and they have soldiers

1588
02:15:47.72 --> 02:15:55.40
and every state and our union but people don't think about that okay so when desert storm ended

1589
02:15:56.44 --> 02:16:07.16
right when desert storm hit the army mobilized both national guard and reserve units okay

1590
02:16:07.16 --> 02:16:13.64
the national guard had no full transparency as I said I'm an army reserve guy okay so I'm

1591
02:16:13.64 --> 02:16:22.12
pretty jaded on this you want to say that but you know the national guard has great patriots

1592
02:16:22.12 --> 02:16:29.32
I'm not casting aspersions on them at all you know but effects are facts and here's what

1593
02:16:29.32 --> 02:16:37.56
happened when when does the storm hit the national guard heads three so-called premier infantry

1594
02:16:37.56 --> 02:16:46.44
brigades that were supposed to round out active duty divisions okay one of them was the 48th

1595
02:16:46.44 --> 02:16:55.64
of Georgia okay and there is a national guard brigade that in upon mobilization they would be assigned

1596
02:16:55.64 --> 02:17:03.48
to that division and they would go to war with the division okay and what happened was when it came

1597
02:17:03.48 --> 02:17:10.68
and by the way they had all the best equipment they had better equipment than some active army

1598
02:17:10.68 --> 02:17:16.60
battalions in brigades they had Abrams tanks they have to understand this is early 90s they had

1599
02:17:16.60 --> 02:17:24.20
Abrams tanks and they had Bradley vehicles when a lot of active units didn't have that okay but

1600
02:17:24.20 --> 02:17:34.20
they were publicized as being the premier army national guard combat units that were ready to go to war okay

1601
02:17:34.20 --> 02:17:40.68
when the balloon went up the army said we can't send these guys they're just going to be cannon fodder

1602
02:17:41.32 --> 02:17:47.16
so they sent them to the NTC and national training center in California for 90 days okay

1603
02:17:47.16 --> 02:17:54.92
only problem was the war ended so quick they never got to the they never got there okay the reserves on

1604
02:17:54.92 --> 02:18:01.72
the other hand our soldiers performed magnificently we had helicopter units we had medical units

1605
02:18:01.72 --> 02:18:09.72
we had civil affairs we had syups we you know our our people did extremely my training division

1606
02:18:09.72 --> 02:18:14.84
perfect example you know we were mobilized I had my guys in the front gates of forward bending

1607
02:18:14.84 --> 02:18:25.40
within 72 hours in my drill instructors around the trail my my my my instructors around the

1608
02:18:25.40 --> 02:18:31.80
platform teaching you know running the ranges and all that and so then when it came time to

1609
02:18:31.80 --> 02:18:39.48
downsize is that where you took a stand yeah absolutely what happened was that you know when the

1610
02:18:39.48 --> 02:18:46.20
we so we winded that there's a storm and then the Soviet Union falls apart and the wall comes down

1611
02:18:46.20 --> 02:18:52.84
right so everybody's looking for this piece of the night to transfer money from the defense department

1612
02:18:52.84 --> 02:19:02.52
to social services okay and so the army has a process that's called the total army analysis

1613
02:19:02.52 --> 02:19:11.64
it's a very good logical process so you can determine the force structure that we need for the army

1614
02:19:11.64 --> 02:19:19.24
okay and the way it works is you look at what are the what are we facing throughout the world

1615
02:19:20.44 --> 02:19:26.20
you know whether the problem areas you know and then you say yourself okay based on that

1616
02:19:26.20 --> 02:19:32.20
how many divisions do you have infantry divisions do we need how many armor you know some

1617
02:19:32.20 --> 02:19:39.32
many helicopter pretend you know blah blah blah and then you face reality and you say how much

1618
02:19:39.32 --> 02:19:45.56
money can we really get out of Congress for this so based on all that stuff you come up with a

1619
02:19:45.56 --> 02:19:55.000
force structure okay the army didn't do that what they did is they had the vice chief of staff

1620
02:19:55.000 --> 02:20:02.68
of the army the chief of army reserves the chief of the National Guard Bureau the president

1621
02:20:02.68 --> 02:20:10.60
of the National Guard Association which is not a government and the president of the reserve officers

1622
02:20:10.60 --> 02:20:19.80
association go to a hotel and they cut a deal and it was called the off site agreement because

1623
02:20:19.80 --> 02:20:25.48
it wasn't done at the Pentagon okay well I told you I had formed a army reserve association

1624
02:20:27.16 --> 02:20:34.52
I had people in that meeting within five minutes I knew what happened and the army reserves

1625
02:20:34.52 --> 02:20:44.52
really they they eliminated 80% of army reserve aviation and we had four special forces groups at

1626
02:20:44.52 --> 02:20:50.12
that time and the reserve components there were two national guard groups the 19th and 20th

1627
02:20:50.52 --> 02:20:56.60
and two army reserve special forces groups the 11th and the 12th the 12th of the

1628
02:20:56.60 --> 02:21:02.76
zone was one of the units died was under my command and I was the deputy commanding general

1629
02:21:02.76 --> 02:21:10.92
of an army reserve unit so I'll give you an example we had a black hawk battalion once again

1630
02:21:10.92 --> 02:21:17.16
in my army reserve under my command that fought in the Gulf they were so good that Schwartz

1631
02:21:17.16 --> 02:21:26.12
cough selected them for his taxing unit okay and they had received the it's called the army

1632
02:21:26.12 --> 02:21:34.12
aviation association award triple a award for the best black hawk battalion so that's how

1633
02:21:34.12 --> 02:21:41.08
good these guys were okay this agreement eliminated that unit out of the army reserves

1634
02:21:41.88 --> 02:21:49.000
and put it into the Illinois National Guard okay now I'm a big boy I can I can accept

1635
02:21:50.20 --> 02:21:54.92
I don't appreciate it as a taxpayer but I can accept waste of money or whatever

1636
02:21:56.04 --> 02:22:02.04
where I draw the line in the sand is when you jeopardize soldiers' lives and the readiness

1637
02:22:02.04 --> 02:22:10.44
of our forces okay this unit overnight oh what I didn't tell you was the Illinois National Guard

1638
02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:19.000
did not have one qualified black hawk pilot or mechanic they could not even fly those birds

1639
02:22:19.72 --> 02:22:24.28
from Scott Air Force Base where we had them to the Illinois National Guard

1640
02:22:24.28 --> 02:22:33.24
field they had to go to the Wisconsin and Minnesota Guard to borrow pilots so they could move

1641
02:22:33.24 --> 02:22:41.08
those birds now the implication is that unit overnight went from C1 you know the highest readiness

1642
02:22:41.08 --> 02:22:52.28
rating down to C5 which is non-negotiable basically you know and it took about to be a year's

1643
02:22:52.28 --> 02:23:01.000
plus to get that unit up to C3 which is just marginal deployment level okay so that's one example

1644
02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:06.68
another example are those special forces groups okay there I mean look at the four reserve

1645
02:23:06.68 --> 02:23:13.40
components special forces groups and they said you know we only need two okay so we'll eliminate

1646
02:23:13.40 --> 02:23:19.56
the National Guard you know groups because you know why does the National Guard govern why does

1647
02:23:19.56 --> 02:23:25.16
a governor need a farcee speaking demolition zexford okay and the last time I looked we didn't

1648
02:23:25.16 --> 02:23:32.92
have an insurgency in Illinois so so the National Guard says no we don't accept that so the army

1649
02:23:32.92 --> 02:23:38.60
with their tail between their legs go back to the drawing board and they looked at readiness which is

1650
02:23:38.60 --> 02:23:43.96
what they probably should have done to begin with and they found out that the 12th group in the USA

1651
02:23:43.96 --> 02:23:49.24
in the army reserves was the best out of the four and then it was either I think it was the 20th

1652
02:23:49.24 --> 02:23:56.52
out of the guard was the second best so they said okay we got the solution we'll take one out of each

1653
02:23:56.52 --> 02:24:04.36
component right guard wouldn't accept that so what did they do they eliminated both our

1654
02:24:04.36 --> 02:24:12.60
may reserve you know groups and I was live it because the 12th was under me at one time I wasn't

1655
02:24:12.60 --> 02:24:22.76
the commander but it was in my chain we had taken that unit from C4 to C2 which for reserve unit to

1656
02:24:22.76 --> 02:24:32.20
be able to get reserveist to past those special forces qualifications that's not easy okay

1657
02:24:32.20 --> 02:24:40.04
and they eliminated that unit now I'm a big boy okay when it came like to the the

1658
02:24:40.04 --> 02:24:50.52
helicopter units and I said okay take my pilots and so and mechanics take the reserve patch off

1659
02:24:50.52 --> 02:24:58.84
their shoulder make a national guardsman I'm good with it okay it wouldn't do it because it was

1660
02:24:58.84 --> 02:25:06.60
jobs for the guard so my guys had to find new jobs some of them had to actually change them

1661
02:25:06.60 --> 02:25:14.20
oasis because you know there were no no aviation jobs from them right and just think you and I

1662
02:25:14.20 --> 02:25:21.72
it's taxpayers how much that cost us you know so now I'm getting all kinds of calls from the field

1663
02:25:22.76 --> 02:25:27.80
you know we didn't have computers at that time in the internet so I'd get telephone calls and

1664
02:25:27.80 --> 02:25:34.12
faxes saying journal somebody's got to stand up and fight this you know and that meeting I told

1665
02:25:34.12 --> 02:25:41.88
you about that they had I found out from my moles that in us and they were going to have a press conference

1666
02:25:41.88 --> 02:25:50.36
the next day where everybody was going to hold hands and sing kumbaya and say that the army has

1667
02:25:50.36 --> 02:25:57.40
come up with this great agreement where everybody agrees and nobody disagrees well that was

1668
02:25:57.40 --> 02:26:05.64
true a lot of people disagreed with it so I called the vice chief of staff's office at the Pentagon

1669
02:26:05.64 --> 02:26:13.48
right not as major general jim huyama but as jim huyama president army reserve association

1670
02:26:14.12 --> 02:26:23.96
okay so I called asking for a return call about this press conference it's going to happen or announcement

1671
02:26:23.96 --> 02:26:31.56
you know and I didn't get a call back so the next morning and hour before their press conference

1672
02:26:32.20 --> 02:26:40.28
we sent out a press release and we basically said this is not good this is you know shouldn't go

1673
02:26:40.28 --> 02:26:49.32
through need to have a GAO study a government accounting office study and that pretty well got me

1674
02:26:49.32 --> 02:26:56.20
into the crossers and so then what we did is and now keep in mind I had never done this in my life

1675
02:26:56.20 --> 02:27:01.64
I had never lobbied I had never been to congress I had never walked the halls you know any of that stuff

1676
02:27:02.44 --> 02:27:07.96
we had a we actually and I think I might have sent you something stuff but we had a

1677
02:27:09.56 --> 02:27:16.84
meeting of the army reserve association called for it in Washington DC and I had men and women come

1678
02:27:16.84 --> 02:27:25.80
from all over the country and we went and we lobbied our senators and congressmen and we told them

1679
02:27:25.80 --> 02:27:33.16
this is wrong this needs to be a GAO study needs to be studied before it's implemented okay

1680
02:27:33.16 --> 02:27:39.96
now frankly I knew we were tilting at windmills but I had to do it because you know all I was

1681
02:27:39.96 --> 02:27:47.32
getting all these requests from sergeants and civilians and latinants and majors throughout the

1682
02:27:47.32 --> 02:27:53.80
country saying somebody's got to fight this and they were right so I had to do it some then

1683
02:27:54.36 --> 02:28:01.24
I get an invitation from a congressional subcommittee okay it was not a subpoena so I didn't

1684
02:28:01.24 --> 02:28:07.24
have to go I could have said I've got a headache or I've got a conflict or whatever but I didn't

1685
02:28:07.24 --> 02:28:15.24
you know I said yeah I'll be there and I went and I testified and a year later I was history

1686
02:28:15.24 --> 02:28:23.56
shall we say but it's like I said Jock I wouldn't hesitate in a moment to do it again

1687
02:28:25.16 --> 02:28:30.92
it's when I was in Vietnam I knew that our generals were not standing up for us all the time

1688
02:28:30.92 --> 02:28:38.20
like they should and I said ever get to a point in my for it's a difference between my career and

1689
02:28:38.68 --> 02:28:45.000
and my soldiers the soldiers win yeah absolutely and that's one of those balanced things too is

1690
02:28:46.12 --> 02:28:50.36
you know as leader what you know you you want to tell the line and I have people ask me this

1691
02:28:50.36 --> 02:28:54.76
pretty regularly well you know you always say you want to support the chain of command but

1692
02:28:54.76 --> 02:28:57.96
what if the chain of command is wrong no it's real simple answer if the chain of command is wrong

1693
02:28:57.96 --> 02:29:03.64
and it's something that matters like the safety of your troops the training of your troops then

1694
02:29:03.64 --> 02:29:07.24
you you stand up to it you know if it's something that doesn't matter if they go we want you to

1695
02:29:07.24 --> 02:29:11.72
fill out this paper work differently than you did it yesterday you know what I do I do it right I don't

1696
02:29:11.72 --> 02:29:16.36
care you know you want me to put my uniform on this way instead of that way that's fine whatever I'll

1697
02:29:16.36 --> 02:29:22.36
do it you want to start putting soldiers at jeopardy that won't that won't stand so here's what

1698
02:29:22.36 --> 02:29:29.96
happened okay while all this stuff is going on the Washington Post puts this front page okay

1699
02:29:29.96 --> 02:29:36.60
and it talks about how the the the the this big controversy you know in my associations right

1700
02:29:36.60 --> 02:29:41.72
at the forefront of all the so I'm quoted and all it's now keep in mind I'm still an active

1701
02:29:41.72 --> 02:29:50.60
arm and these are major general and radar right and and in fact before I testified I got a call

1702
02:29:50.60 --> 02:29:55.000
from the chief of staff at trade-ock was a good friend of mine we were both major generals

1703
02:29:55.64 --> 02:30:03.08
and and he didn't tell me I shouldn't go he kind of said that well you know it's really not a good

1704
02:30:03.08 --> 02:30:09.72
idea you know for you to go and he was a good friend of mine and I said John you know I understand

1705
02:30:10.52 --> 02:30:16.28
this is you have to do this this is your you know this is your job but I got to go I can't

1706
02:30:16.28 --> 02:30:25.80
I cannot stand by and let this pass so he under well and so that was also in the Washington Post

1707
02:30:25.80 --> 02:30:33.08
you know like I was threatened I wasn't threatened you know and so so basically I

1708
02:30:34.12 --> 02:30:42.60
then the army times wrote a net tutorial which basically criticized the army reserves especially

1709
02:30:42.60 --> 02:30:50.84
my association you know and saying the army reserves are not team players their cry babies you know

1710
02:30:51.40 --> 02:30:56.28
and but what got me is when they said they're putting out bad information okay that was in

1711
02:30:56.28 --> 02:31:06.36
their editorial okay so I wrote an op-f which to their credit they published okay and in the op-fed

1712
02:31:06.36 --> 02:31:15.64
I said number one where is and the title of their their editorial was the enemy is us okay

1713
02:31:16.44 --> 02:31:24.52
and I said I agree with you the enemy is us but the problem is number one where is

1714
02:31:25.96 --> 02:31:33.000
you didn't list in detail the false information that was being put out by the reserves

1715
02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:39.64
so you need to do that I said that in the op-fed they never did by the way because we had never

1716
02:31:39.64 --> 02:31:48.68
put out anything false but the second thing I said and I said if we go to war in the next 18 months

1717
02:31:49.40 --> 02:31:54.92
and this thing goes through we're gonna have people coming back and body bags that would not have

1718
02:31:54.92 --> 02:32:03.48
I mean now that's a pretty serious statement okay and you would think if I was chicken little saying

1719
02:32:03.48 --> 02:32:10.20
the sky was falling that they would have been inundated with letters from the field saying you know

1720
02:32:10.20 --> 02:32:19.24
the general is gone too far right they didn't get one letter and so but so because of the stand I

1721
02:32:19.24 --> 02:32:26.28
took needless to say the army wasn't real happy with me and a year later when it came time to

1722
02:32:28.12 --> 02:32:35.24
to get a new assignment surprise surprise I was not considered there were no assignments

1723
02:32:35.24 --> 02:32:43.32
that I was considered eligible for and so I I said this has been fun so the chief of our

1724
02:32:43.32 --> 02:32:49.56
reserve actually wanted me to stay and he said this two shall pass so why don't you stay you can

1725
02:32:49.56 --> 02:32:54.92
go into control group which is kind of this administrative pool of people who don't have assignments

1726
02:32:55.56 --> 02:33:01.16
and maybe in a year or two you can come back you know we'll get you an assignment and I said no

1727
02:33:01.16 --> 02:33:07.000
I said you know the army's made it very clear you know they they don't want my services they don't

1728
02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:12.92
think I have any value and I'm gonna move on I'm gonna move on in life hmm hmm so

1729
02:33:12.92 --> 02:33:19.08
what I did now even though you moved on you retired you didn't stop serving by any stretch and

1730
02:33:19.08 --> 02:33:25.48
and you know I look at the military outreach that you started is really your new way of serving

1731
02:33:25.48 --> 02:33:31.56
it was that is that an accurate statement oh absolutely what what happened was you know my wife is

1732
02:33:31.56 --> 02:33:38.20
is so wonderful she she says she's not as as a Christian as I am but she lives her life

1733
02:33:38.20 --> 02:33:45.40
better than I do and so I'm having my personal pity party feeling sorry for myself because my 32 year

1734
02:33:45.40 --> 02:33:53.000
career is down to toilet right and she said Jim you know God is sending you a message number one

1735
02:33:53.80 --> 02:34:02.92
that you know this chapter in your life is over okay number two you survive Vietnam you also

1736
02:34:02.92 --> 02:34:09.96
became a Tain the rank of two star general which was the highest in reserveist could get at that time okay

1737
02:34:09.96 --> 02:34:16.92
and then she says number three and you got me as a wife how can I argue with that right

1738
02:34:16.92 --> 02:34:21.88
but she was absolutely right what happened was God brought other things into my life at that time

1739
02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:31.48
promised keepers which is a men's Christian group I got involved with a church in Chicago

1740
02:34:31.48 --> 02:34:38.92
a real quick community church which is a very famous evangelical church I I let a men's small group

1741
02:34:38.92 --> 02:34:45.32
I lead a men's monthly breakfast I got involved with the department of veterans affairs which I had

1742
02:34:45.32 --> 02:34:51.48
never been involved in before at a national level I was a chairman of an advisory committee on

1743
02:34:51.48 --> 02:34:59.16
minority veterans and I was I was on that for five years so I learned about the VA system

1744
02:34:59.16 --> 02:35:08.44
all of this was in preparation for me to eventually start military outreach USA about seven years ago

1745
02:35:09.64 --> 02:35:17.48
which is a nonprofit faith based organization for the very simple concept jacco we're trying to

1746
02:35:17.48 --> 02:35:25.40
develop a national network of partners mostly houses of worship of all faiths by the way

1747
02:35:25.40 --> 02:35:36.52
and organizations like the BFW American Legion rotary clubs lions clubs high schools this is all at the

1748
02:35:36.52 --> 02:35:44.12
local community level that will reach out to our military community which we define by the way

1749
02:35:44.12 --> 02:35:51.48
as active duty reserves national guard veterans of all areas and their family members we stress the

1750
02:35:51.48 --> 02:35:59.72
family members equally because they serve in sacrifices well okay and to reach out to them to be

1751
02:36:00.36 --> 02:36:07.64
a welcoming environment to appreciate their service recognize that and to offer hope and help

1752
02:36:07.64 --> 02:36:14.36
if they need it now the churches and and synagogues want to help they don't know how to do it

1753
02:36:14.36 --> 02:36:22.60
because they don't understand the military culture they don't know the issues that our military

1754
02:36:22.60 --> 02:36:29.16
community is facing and they don't know where the resources are that's where military outreach USA

1755
02:36:29.16 --> 02:36:38.92
comes in we provide all of that information we have webinars we have publications we have DVDs

1756
02:36:38.92 --> 02:36:49.08
we have presentations and everything that we do is free of charge no cost the only thing we ask is

1757
02:36:49.08 --> 02:36:55.48
when people join us as partners either as a house of worship or as an organization that they

1758
02:36:55.48 --> 02:37:02.52
commit to take our materials and use them to help our military community and it doesn't cost them anything

1759
02:37:02.52 --> 02:37:11.88
and if people want to want to help out military outreach USA the website is military outreach

1760
02:37:11.88 --> 02:37:18.52
USA dot org that's correct and then from there what are you looking for? Well we have numerous

1761
02:37:18.52 --> 02:37:26.12
programs because we understand houses of worship coming all shapes and sizes okay so we have

1762
02:37:26.12 --> 02:37:34.68
different programs that they can choose from some are as simple as a church can list the names

1763
02:37:35.40 --> 02:37:42.12
of service members who are currently serving you know either relatives or members of the church

1764
02:37:42.12 --> 02:37:49.80
and people can pray for them prayer is so important when you're overseas especially in a combat

1765
02:37:49.80 --> 02:37:56.44
situation I know it helped me a lot when I was in combat I needed all I could get I'll tell you

1766
02:37:57.48 --> 02:38:04.20
but also they could do things like send packages send letters how today who writes letters nobody

1767
02:38:04.20 --> 02:38:10.76
you know it's all email and all that stuff how about getting a letter right at mail call how need is that

1768
02:38:11.96 --> 02:38:18.04
you know but then we can also do things for veterans in fact we we have

1769
02:38:18.04 --> 02:38:25.32
two years ago we started a program and by the way we have a memorandum of agreement that was

1770
02:38:25.32 --> 02:38:34.84
signed by the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2016 by the secretary himself which recognized military

1771
02:38:34.84 --> 02:38:42.76
outreach USA as a national partner with them on a program that we initiated called Veterans

1772
02:38:42.76 --> 02:38:51.64
Exiting Homelessness okay now here's the thing the VA has done a very good job in reducing

1773
02:38:52.28 --> 02:38:58.44
the veteran homeless population it's still too high but three years ago it was like 150,000

1774
02:38:59.16 --> 02:39:04.52
you know it's like 50,000 now which is still too high but look at the look at the reduction okay

1775
02:39:04.52 --> 02:39:11.96
well that's created a new problem and the problem is when they take a homeless veteran mail or female

1776
02:39:11.96 --> 02:39:19.88
some with kids off the street and they work with a case worker or a social worker okay and the

1777
02:39:19.88 --> 02:39:24.52
social worker feels that they're stabilized and now they can get them into what's so it's called

1778
02:39:24.52 --> 02:39:31.56
permanent housing which is really an apartment that's got it's subsidized by a HUD-Vash

1779
02:39:31.56 --> 02:39:38.28
voucher okay they give them the keys they be apartment right but homeless people that's all they

1780
02:39:38.28 --> 02:39:43.48
give them so just think at the first time you moved into an apartment you need stuff

1781
02:39:44.20 --> 02:39:54.12
like all toilet paper buckets sponges, mobs you know dishes how about a bed homeless people they

1782
02:39:54.12 --> 02:39:59.96
get a one bedroom apartment but guess what they don't have a death right so we came up with this

1783
02:39:59.96 --> 02:40:07.40
program called move any essentials and we listed things like we have a bathroom kit we have a kitchen

1784
02:40:07.40 --> 02:40:14.52
kit we even have a beds for vets program okay and what we've done is we've gone out to our

1785
02:40:15.48 --> 02:40:21.72
our churches our partners you know our organizations and we've asked them can you conduct a donation

1786
02:40:21.72 --> 02:40:29.56
drive of this stuff okay and not asking them collect money give me the stuff okay and then

1787
02:40:29.56 --> 02:40:38.92
it's delivered to the VA medical center social worker and they distributed to the veterans so

1788
02:40:38.92 --> 02:40:43.88
we know they're going to veterans okay because you know there are a lot of people out there

1789
02:40:43.88 --> 02:40:49.56
are clean to be veterans who are not and so we know they're going to veterans and it goes out

1790
02:40:49.56 --> 02:40:56.76
almost as quick as it comes in okay this has helped us a great deal as an organization because before

1791
02:40:56.76 --> 02:41:03.88
we're at a point in time where we really can move up to the next level is an organization

1792
02:41:04.28 --> 02:41:10.04
but we frankly need volunteers and money okay because we don't have a staff we've done all this

1793
02:41:10.04 --> 02:41:20.28
on a shoe string basically and so with this program we now have results that we can show people okay

1794
02:41:20.28 --> 02:41:27.72
so people come to me and say you know what difference are you guys making two years ago all I could

1795
02:41:27.72 --> 02:41:34.20
say was what were developing this network of partners and we're asking them to help you know

1796
02:41:34.20 --> 02:41:39.80
in their communities which did make a difference by the way I mean we prevented some suicides

1797
02:41:39.80 --> 02:41:46.44
we've helped people that needed stuff you know but we did the have I don't I don't have the staff

1798
02:41:46.44 --> 02:41:53.40
to record all of this stuff you know but when we came up with this program we have a tracking

1799
02:41:53.40 --> 02:42:00.60
thing where we know how many veterans are being helped we know what's been collected and we know

1800
02:42:00.60 --> 02:42:07.64
so now if somebody says what difference do you make okay since January of 2016

1801
02:42:07.64 --> 02:42:20.92
we have helped over 31,000 veterans we've collected over 750,000 items in fact I think it's over

1802
02:42:20.92 --> 02:42:30.20
million though and valued at almost 2 million dollars and we have we just provided this month

1803
02:42:30.20 --> 02:42:39.40
our 1000's bed okay and so now I got stuff that I can tell people this well we come up with

1804
02:42:39.40 --> 02:42:47.80
the new program this year and it's called adopt a caregiver okay see what we're trying to do is find

1805
02:42:48.52 --> 02:42:56.44
find gaps where there's a need and nobody else is filling it so we first we did that veteran

1806
02:42:56.44 --> 02:43:05.96
exiting homelessness thing well now there are 5.5 million military caregivers in our country

1807
02:43:06.76 --> 02:43:18.84
okay serving over 1.1 million normal military okay and they get some help from the VA

1808
02:43:19.56 --> 02:43:26.20
but not a lot as much as they need okay so we are now going to our churches and our

1809
02:43:26.20 --> 02:43:34.68
organizations and we're saying we have this program adopt a caregiver okay and if you want to be a

1810
02:43:34.68 --> 02:43:41.48
caregiver you let us know and we'll contact the local social worker and volunteer

1811
02:43:42.20 --> 02:43:51.16
support at the VA facility near you and we'll hook you up with a caregiver that needs help

1812
02:43:51.16 --> 02:43:57.48
now this could be anything could be babysitting could be mowing along it could be shoveling snow

1813
02:43:57.48 --> 02:44:04.12
it could be showing up with a meal it could be just showing up and being there for 3 hours

1814
02:44:04.12 --> 02:44:10.76
and let the caregiver get up break okay this is not rocket science it's stuff it's an easy

1815
02:44:10.76 --> 02:44:17.40
program but it's something that if we can get this moving like we did the veteran exiting homelessness

1816
02:44:17.40 --> 02:44:23.56
it's going to be a tremendous help for our veterans and but most importantly for the caregivers

1817
02:44:23.56 --> 02:44:31.16
you see at another lifetime my wife and I were hospice patient volunteers we did that for six

1818
02:44:31.16 --> 02:44:41.32
years so I know how it is to deal with terminal illness okay but I also witnessed that it's the

1819
02:44:41.32 --> 02:44:50.20
caregivers who are sometimes need to help more than the patient you know and so in this case

1820
02:44:50.20 --> 02:44:55.16
we've got military caregivers that need help and we can do it through this program

1821
02:44:57.56 --> 02:45:02.92
well it sounds like like I said you're continuing to serve even though you're no longer in

1822
02:45:02.92 --> 02:45:11.000
uniform and I think that's probably a pretty good place to wrap up for today and you know again

1823
02:45:11.96 --> 02:45:17.48
it's been just an absolute honor to sit down and talk with you as we get feedback from this

1824
02:45:17.48 --> 02:45:25.08
episode I will come to Chicago and go to your museum and and we'll do this again yeah let me

1825
02:45:25.08 --> 02:45:31.16
say one thing that I was not able to get in and anybody who knows me would tell me June why

1826
02:45:31.16 --> 02:45:38.68
didn't you say that I have a standard mantra okay and that is every day is a great day I have my

1827
02:45:38.68 --> 02:45:46.20
faith my family and live in the finest country in the world I say it every day every chance I got

1828
02:45:46.84 --> 02:45:52.04
and people ask me well why you know how can you be so positive and you know why do you say that I say

1829
02:45:52.04 --> 02:46:00.84
well number one is a very young 24-year-old company commander in Vietnam in combat there were times

1830
02:46:00.84 --> 02:46:05.72
I didn't know if I was going to be alive the next moment much less seed and next sunrise

1831
02:46:06.20 --> 02:46:12.44
when you're in no circumstances what is important in life becomes real focused and that is faith,

1832
02:46:12.44 --> 02:46:18.84
family and living in the finest country in the world now so then people will come back at me and say well

1833
02:46:18.84 --> 02:46:25.000
how can you say that when we have so much division in our country okay and I say listen I'm a little bit

1834
02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:32.76
longer and toothed than you are and when I was a kid the I've seen the improvements in our society

1835
02:46:32.76 --> 02:46:39.96
when it comes to race relations now I'm a minority so I get it and I told them the odds of

1836
02:46:39.96 --> 02:46:45.72
me becoming when I was a kid the odds of me becoming a major general in the United States Army

1837
02:46:45.72 --> 02:46:53.32
were slim and next and none okay when you know when we've had an African American president who was

1838
02:46:53.32 --> 02:47:01.32
re-elected and then I tell people when president Kennedy was elected that was a big deal and

1839
02:47:01.32 --> 02:47:07.96
a lot of people don't know why and I say because he was Catholic but today that's that's not a

1840
02:47:07.96 --> 02:47:14.12
big deal right in that that those in those days that was a big deal so I tell people every day

1841
02:47:14.12 --> 02:47:19.48
is a great day I have my faith my family we live in the finest country in the world well

1842
02:47:19.48 --> 02:47:26.84
that saying was challenged about five and a half years ago when I had some health challenges which

1843
02:47:26.84 --> 02:47:36.04
I think I didn't mention it earlier I was still working in financial services in the street and I

1844
02:47:36.04 --> 02:47:43.24
got up in the morning on shaving and I felt this pain in my chest and I mean it wasn't a serious

1845
02:47:43.24 --> 02:47:49.96
pounding and I wasn't sweating nauseous I didn't have a temperature so I thought it was something I ate

1846
02:47:49.96 --> 02:47:56.76
you know give it five minutes it'll go away right it didn't go away so I told my wife this is not good

1847
02:47:57.40 --> 02:48:03.24
so I finished shaving and dressing though and she drove me to the emergency room of the hospital

1848
02:48:03.24 --> 02:48:08.04
so I walk in and I say hey you know I've got this pain in my chest I don't know what it is

1849
02:48:08.04 --> 02:48:14.92
so they do an EKG and they said you have had a heart attack well suddenly all these doctors and

1850
02:48:14.92 --> 02:48:21.64
nurses swoop into the ER they address me they put me in a hospital gown I'm on a gurney and I'm on my

1851
02:48:21.64 --> 02:48:28.04
way to the operating room right so I'm in the corridor and on this gurney and I say to myself

1852
02:48:28.04 --> 02:48:35.80
self can you say today is a great day and I said I absolutely can I survive yet um

1853
02:48:35.80 --> 02:48:49.16
I have a wonderful wife and children and I most importantly have my faith so in 24 hours I have

1854
02:48:49.16 --> 02:48:55.16
three operations the first operation was for the heart attack okay so they do an angel grand they

1855
02:48:55.16 --> 02:49:03.000
found out my LAD which is the widow maker artery was 90% block so they do an angel plastic put a

1856
02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:08.44
stand in so by 10 o'clock in the morning I'm in the recovery room so I'm forgetting well that's

1857
02:49:08.44 --> 02:49:14.12
that's the end of it right that wasn't the end of it the second thing that happened was my heart

1858
02:49:14.12 --> 02:49:21.24
cavity started to fill up with liquid it's called a fusion so I had to go back in for and they

1859
02:49:21.24 --> 02:49:26.60
had to put a hole in my chest so they could put a tube there so they could drain this liquid and it

1860
02:49:26.60 --> 02:49:33.32
filled up the bottle it took about 24 hours to do that okay the third thing that happened then

1861
02:49:33.80 --> 02:49:40.20
was my kidneys failed so I had to go back in and they had to put another hole in my chest so they

1862
02:49:40.20 --> 02:49:48.44
could hook up a dialysis machine okay so the standard procedure every time I was rolled into the

1863
02:49:48.44 --> 02:49:55.56
operating room is what's your name what's your birthday how do you feel okay so I'm on the operating

1864
02:49:55.56 --> 02:50:03.72
table and I say Jim Moquillama August 3rd 44 every day is a great day I have my faith my family

1865
02:50:03.72 --> 02:50:09.24
and live in the finest country in the world I can't tell you the effect that had on the doctors and

1866
02:50:09.24 --> 02:50:15.80
nurses the first operation the doctor said what is your faith and I said well since you asked me

1867
02:50:15.80 --> 02:50:24.12
doc I said I'm a Christian Christ is my Savior your skill physician skill nurses but I'm in God's hands

1868
02:50:24.12 --> 02:50:31.24
so whatever he decides I'm okay with so let's get on with it so the second operation there was a

1869
02:50:31.24 --> 02:50:38.68
nurse and she said where do you go to church and I said well I attend Willow Creek Community Church

1870
02:50:39.24 --> 02:50:46.44
and she said I do too so no coincidence the third operation this was the coolest thing

1871
02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:53.96
there was a male nurse who is wearing a camouflage gown and I said you must have been in

1872
02:50:53.96 --> 02:50:59.64
the army because I said yeah I was a medic and I said well hey I just want you to know

1873
02:50:59.64 --> 02:51:05.64
every tired is the two star general so take good care of me will you and so that was kind of

1874
02:51:05.64 --> 02:51:11.56
my my testing of all that now the final thing I tell you which was a god thing

1875
02:51:14.84 --> 02:51:20.52
months later I was going I had to go through dialysis okay so I'm going through this dialysis

1876
02:51:20.52 --> 02:51:28.60
and three months later I get a donor and the donor was our daughter okay but our daughter is not

1877
02:51:28.60 --> 02:51:37.16
our biological daughter we adopted her 30 something years ago and yet she was a match so

1878
02:51:37.16 --> 02:51:43.24
guys when I say every day is a great day I have my faith my family and live in the kind of

1879
02:51:43.24 --> 02:51:51.80

1891
02:53:17.40 --> 02:53:22.12
could you brief us on those things namely your joints you want to keep those together

1892
02:53:23.96 --> 02:53:28.52
good it's a big deal if they're not together so good news if you didn't all right already even

1893
02:53:28.52 --> 02:53:35.88
though you didn't already jacquoise supplements they're called jacco super krill it's krill oil

1894
02:53:35.88 --> 02:53:41.40
but that's not in the name technically also jacco joint warfare also for your joints obviously

1895
02:53:42.84 --> 02:53:46.20
take both of there's some anti inflammatory stuff in there too by the way

1896
02:53:47.72 --> 02:53:51.64
something that I might have mentioned before you know for your joints very good very important

1897
02:53:51.64 --> 02:53:58.84
subscribe for the the recurring delivery yeah because you don't want to run out

1898
02:53:58.84 --> 02:54:04.04
I'm telling you it's junk when you're at out I run out before it's wack also discipline

1899
02:54:04.04 --> 02:54:11.56
supplement called discipline it is a pre workout pre mission pre study pre take test pre cognitive

1900
02:54:11.56 --> 02:54:17.16
enhancing supplements good this is a good one pre get after it and it tastes good interestingly

1901
02:54:17.16 --> 02:54:24.44
you know jacco focused a lot on that taste good lemon lime etc etc make calories in this one I

1902
02:54:24.44 --> 02:54:29.48
don't know not not very many 30 alright there you go so you can do it while you fast too technically

1903
02:54:30.36 --> 02:54:34.36
depends on your metabolic response look can do it before you fast I'm not gonna make any claims

1904
02:54:34.36 --> 02:54:39.56
nonetheless it's a good one for your brain for your body good supplement also

1905
02:54:39.56 --> 02:54:50.04
mook yeah so is gonna say the routine powder so mook protein powder do you are you are we

1906
02:54:50.04 --> 02:54:53.96
even calling a protein powder are we just calling that straight up mook no it's it's not it's mook

1907
02:54:53.96 --> 02:55:01.88
straight up mook we different with the moots yeah yeah let's so so that is chocolate chip no mint chocolate

1908
02:55:01.88 --> 02:55:08.12
yeah no chips yeah yeah so if you don't like mint chocolate chip you might there's a chance you

1909
02:55:08.12 --> 02:55:12.76
might not like this if you do like mint chocolate chip there's a real good chip there's like I

1910
02:55:12.76 --> 02:55:19.40
would say around 100% probability you're gonna like this one I should clarify that I mix it

1911
02:55:20.76 --> 02:55:27.96
primarily with milk me too I have mix it also plain with well not plain but with cold water

1912
02:55:28.68 --> 02:55:35.08
it's with milk it's straight up delicious yeah it's like it's a milkshake it's like oh

1913
02:55:35.08 --> 02:55:42.60
what do I truly in the world want to have for dessert I want to have mook right with water

1914
02:55:43.64 --> 02:55:51.16
it's more like a ham sandwich you know like okay hey this thing is good I you know I need some fuel

1915
02:55:51.16 --> 02:55:56.44
you don't you don't get all fired up when you have a ham sandwich right yeah you're not you're not

1916
02:55:57.48 --> 02:56:02.20
you're not reaching the next level yeah you're happy you're not fired up yeah yeah that's kind of what

1917
02:56:02.20 --> 02:56:11.88
milk with water is like a ham sandwich it's better for you but taste taste reaction is about the

1918
02:56:11.88 --> 02:56:19.96
same for me ham sandwich yeah okay yeah with milk with milk so it's legit what is it like a

1919
02:56:19.96 --> 02:56:25.32
what like a steak yeah compared to hang that's how hard to peel boom jockel's review

1920
02:56:25.32 --> 02:56:29.24
unlawful well the show actually no it's not it's like a mint chocolate chip milkshake that's what

1921
02:56:29.24 --> 02:56:33.88
it's like yeah because a steak is a different thing for me steak is a little bit of a different

1922
02:56:33.88 --> 02:56:39.56
experience that's a really good experience so technically you kind of got to try to play steak no

1923
02:56:40.28 --> 02:56:46.68
but if you live the last fast I did you know and I posted that picture and I went got that

1924
02:56:47.24 --> 02:56:54.84
I wouldn't got a killer steak yeah any I think was so good because you did after that so good yeah

1925
02:56:54.84 --> 02:57:01.64
we got 100% of the taste 100% of the taste no more than 100% the country 10% yeah yeah

1926
02:57:02.28 --> 02:57:11.40
somebody sent me some tomahawk steaks to my house and they came with instructions from the company

1927
02:57:11.40 --> 02:57:15.96
that sent him on how to cook them and I don't remember the name of the company right now I fall

1928
02:57:15.96 --> 02:57:23.96
those instructions I cook those steaks those things were epic yeah they were epic yeah so

1929
02:57:23.96 --> 02:57:29.08
interestingly yeah no steaks came to my house or anything like that or you know the house next

1930
02:57:29.08 --> 02:57:33.96
time but hey they do sound good and they sound even better after because currently we're getting

1931
02:57:33.96 --> 02:57:43.16
our fast on yes currently officially too yeah what do we have you know well are you I'm at

1932
02:57:43.16 --> 02:57:49.40

1933
02:57:49.40 --> 02:57:55.16
11 o'clock last night yeah you got issues why that's how what are you doing even 11 o'clock at night because

1934
02:57:55.16 --> 02:58:00.84
like I don't really start eating till like later in the day you say I don't know he breakfast like

1935
02:58:00.84 --> 02:58:04.36
that you see him playing though like let's say he eat three meals a day and that's not a lot

1936
02:58:04.36 --> 02:58:08.92
by the way that's actually a little bit you know some guys it all it's six times a day you know that kind

1937
02:58:08.92 --> 02:58:15.000
not like that kind three times a day sometimes too so let's say I ate my first meal no breakfast

1938
02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:21.88
only water maybe some coffee sometimes maybe some get ready sometimes maybe like a banana sometimes

1939
02:58:21.88 --> 02:58:30.68
not a lot nonetheless at noon ish one maybe too lunch dinner eight it like six boom and then again

1940
02:58:30.68 --> 02:58:36.92
at 11 that's not that much yeah okay do you want to do it over there nonetheless I'm at about 18 hours

1941
02:58:36.92 --> 02:58:41.32
you can take and that's take that you're just talking about the Tom Aquan sounds real good yeah

1942
02:58:41.32 --> 02:58:46.04
but yeah better cut real fired up but that's right now real fired up by the way you didn't even

1943
02:58:46.04 --> 02:58:50.36
mention where you can get all this good stuff well there's even more good stuff so what I what I

1944
02:58:50.36 --> 02:58:55.16
like to do is like get us really excited about everything and then it's like dang working you get it

1945
02:58:55.16 --> 02:59:03.16
boom or you know I do want to say we have in the testing phase right now chocolate peanut butter

1946
02:59:03.16 --> 02:59:10.76
milk milk now everyone's probably wondering hey what's up what's up with just chocolate milk yeah

1947
02:59:12.12 --> 02:59:17.72
we for whatever reason I don't know if it's the complimentary of flavors but we haven't been

1948
02:59:17.72 --> 02:59:25.40
able to nail the chocolate flavor the way we want it at this time yeah the the mint I don't know you

1949
02:59:25.40 --> 02:59:31.64
know the mint is awesome the chocolate peanut butter epic yeah we haven't nailed the chocolate yet

1950
02:59:31.64 --> 02:59:38.28
we got vanilla the vanilla's I'm not a vanilla fan yeah but the vanilla's good yeah I can't I can't

1951
02:59:38.28 --> 02:59:45.80
give it nine stars because I I can't give nine stars to things that I don't personally really love

1952
02:59:45.80 --> 02:59:51.08
the taste of because I don't love vanilla I'll try it again once once we roll out with the actual

1953
02:59:51.48 --> 02:59:57.64
live vanilla milk sure but the chocolate milk will come when we get it right but the peanut butter

1954
02:59:57.64 --> 03:00:04.36
milk stand by the get so yeah it's so good isn't that the whole kind of defining factor of the

1955
03:00:04.36 --> 03:00:08.92
vanilla flavor it's like it's not supposed to be amazing it's supposed to be vanilla like people

1956
03:00:08.92 --> 03:00:14.52
use the word vanilla no no no no no no no no no no no no let me tell you I actually let me tell you

1957
03:00:14.52 --> 03:00:22.76
when when I do absolutely love vanilla flavor you know when you go to a restaurant and you're

1958
03:00:22.76 --> 03:00:28.84
like all right tonight we're gonna get some and you order dessert and you get some kind of a chocolate

1959
03:00:28.84 --> 03:00:35.24
scenario let's say let's just let's just talk about a chocolate that's not chocolate brownie right

1960
03:00:35.24 --> 03:00:42.60
sir yeah you roll up one of those so there's my my local one of my local restaurants they have a

1961
03:00:42.60 --> 03:00:50.12
dessert they call it the illegal because it's so good it should be illegal yeah this is raglan

1962
03:00:50.12 --> 03:00:56.92
sure raglan will be and what it is they take a cast iron skillet and they put

1963
03:00:57.88 --> 03:01:03.40
chocolate chip cookie in there and then and I when they make it for us we don't we get it

1964
03:01:03.40 --> 03:01:10.36
I don't want every two months we'll go illegal time and that was an extra ice cream because you

1965
03:01:10.36 --> 03:01:15.56
need it because it's got that chocolate it's hot yeah so good and you know what I just realized

1966
03:01:15.56 --> 03:01:21.48
we're on the 24 hour fast right now all the time I was through yeah it's like dang this

1967
03:01:21.48 --> 03:01:25.80
thing kind of long but I kind of don't mind it and you're right about that vanilla thing too

1968
03:01:25.80 --> 03:01:30.28
by the way because people do well people do use the word vanilla to describe a real

1969
03:01:30.28 --> 03:01:34.04
bit of the brand stuff just yes just vanilla which is you know it's not great but it's not

1970
03:01:34.04 --> 03:01:40.04
junk it's still it's still a bit of a cast iron skillet you're 100% right especially when

1971
03:01:40.04 --> 03:01:43.32
you said when you go to restaurants I probably go on where you go with this and you absolutely

1972
03:01:43.32 --> 03:01:48.04
right so that being said so what do you do then you put some chocolate like her she's

1973
03:01:48.04 --> 03:01:52.44
syrup in the vanilla milk that's a violation though but that'd be a big fight that just sounds

1974
03:01:52.44 --> 03:01:57.32
real good right now I'm just that's why that's so sick nonetheless the

1975
03:01:57.32 --> 03:02:02.36
she never let me go it should be illegal for us to do see I've been I've been fasting before

1976

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:17.000
all different question but they say what brand of geet here's a brand origin brand 100% made in America

1990
03:03:17.88 --> 03:03:24.28
best these are the geets that like peat and all that when they make them they take into consideration

1991
03:03:24.28 --> 03:03:29.80
all the movements of jiu jitsu like everything even down to this and think about we might not even

1992
03:03:29.80 --> 03:03:35.08
thought about it like outside of when you put this on okay so in a regular geet they have the string

1993
03:03:35.08 --> 03:03:39.80
to tie on the pants not to belt the string on the pants then you have a belt they go

1994
03:03:39.80 --> 03:03:46.36
over the the geetop all that stuff no that's string fine were you still it fine there's a cool string

1995
03:03:46.36 --> 03:03:50.92
but you ever like put in the dryer or you got caught on something or whatever and that string gets

1996
03:03:50.92 --> 03:03:55.64
lost in the little tooth later I don't even know how you you'd like but you see them saying right

1997
03:03:55.64 --> 03:03:58.76
yeah good project and that's a good idea that'll happen to your hoodie and you gotta get the

1998
03:03:58.76 --> 03:04:03.48
hanger and you gotta do this big thing if you even know how otherwise you're kind of screwed

1999
03:04:03.48 --> 03:04:07.80
in away because you gotta go all up in there now take the origin geet these are just these details

2000
03:04:07.80 --> 03:04:11.24
that when you get someone who's thinking of this kind of stuff when they design the whole geet

2001
03:04:11.24 --> 03:04:16.20
you got some geet there that this is one of the many reasons why you get the origin geet this one

2002
03:04:16.20 --> 03:04:22.36
the string comes out that's okay because it's not this this endless black hole loop holder

2003
03:04:22.36 --> 03:04:28.76
I don't want you to say yeah it's like it'll have like it's like giant thick wide bell loops yeah

2004
03:04:28.76 --> 03:04:33.24
and a bunch of them too so you have like you know it's it's so easy to put them in that's even

2005
03:04:33.24 --> 03:04:37.64
if you even want the string if you don't want the string you're like hey I don't I'm I'm over strings

2006
03:04:37.64 --> 03:04:42.20
I don't like tying my string they give you this little bit you see if you have origin geet you're like

2007
03:04:42.20 --> 03:04:48.76
you're exactly exactly like a little lock yeah well yeah yeah I'm a belt it's a teeny it's a thin

2008
03:04:48.76 --> 03:04:54.20
belt that goes through and click you click the belt make it tighter whatever's like a little mini belt

2009
03:04:54.20 --> 03:04:57.32
you don't you don't feel it when you're rolling nothing like that did you think you're going to

2010
03:04:57.32 --> 03:05:01.96
feel it when you were old it was a question there was a question for me to I thought I'd you know

2011
03:05:02.68 --> 03:05:06.60
this seems kind of weird yeah and then you put it on you don't you don't notice it all you don't

2012
03:05:06.60 --> 03:05:10.12
notice until it comes time to take it off and it's so easy yeah you're like boom and here's the

2013
03:05:10.12 --> 03:05:15.32
thing again it's like we probably never really thought of this until you actually do it like

2014
03:05:15.32 --> 03:05:18.76
after when you when you're done you don't really think about it but it's just one of those things

2015
03:05:18.76 --> 03:05:23.80
or like dang this is good these are good these are good these are good keys one of the many details

2016
03:05:23.80 --> 03:05:30.92
yeah included I was talking to a guy yesterday I was getting interviewed and I said there's a

2017
03:05:30.92 --> 03:05:35.80
world you know I he's asking me about all my different businesses right whatever that means all

2018
03:05:35.80 --> 03:05:43.24
opinion yeah yeah and I said we know I have a parallel company and we make we make a parallel

2019
03:05:43.24 --> 03:05:50.28
up in Maine got a big factory up in Maine he says oh up in Maine that's up in Maine a factory in Maine

2020
03:05:50.84 --> 03:05:55.40
and you know I was like yeah and he was all surprised and I said you know what it's sad that you're

2021
03:05:55.40 --> 03:06:03.08
surprised at that because 50 years ago everybody knew that that's where they made stuff they made it

2022
03:06:03.08 --> 03:06:08.52
up there and it all disappeared and now it's coming back and we're bringing it back I told this guy

2023
03:06:08.52 --> 03:06:12.84
it's a spring in a back we're bringing back made effect we got what weaving material up there

2024
03:06:12.84 --> 03:06:16.44
you know what that you don't even know what I'm talking about people's first instinct is like oh

2025
03:06:16.44 --> 03:06:20.76
if you want material you got to go to overseas and you got to have you got to get it made some

2026
03:06:20.76 --> 03:06:25.56
sweatshop somewhere right that's literally what that's that's that's accepted right that's

2027
03:06:25.56 --> 03:06:30.04
except oh you just you know hey you can't beat those prices and you can't you can't overcome the

2028
03:06:30.04 --> 03:06:36.36
the tariffs and whatever else no you know what yes you can yes you can't and we are we're doing it

2029
03:06:36.36 --> 03:06:42.44
yeah you get the cotton in like North Carolina you're screwed up he's own South Carolina

2030
03:06:42.44 --> 03:06:47.80
I believe I'm screwed it up too get the cotton in America one of the car in America in America

2031
03:06:47.80 --> 03:06:50.76
since the thing is they just talked to Peter and I'm pretty sure he said North could have been

2032
03:06:50.76 --> 03:06:57.24
South I don't know I forget I apologize nonetheless it is in America just like how you said and

2033
03:06:57.24 --> 03:07:01.16
then they bring it up and here's what it is to the secret they have their looms they have their own looms

2034
03:07:01.16 --> 03:07:06.44
yeah you can't just walk into the store and start buying looms you just can't do that that's why it's hard to you

2035
03:07:06.44 --> 03:07:11.08
know to kind that's why they have a unique situation there what's all mean in America and hey everyone that is

2050
03:08:34.76 --> 03:08:38.92
at full capacity the jiu jiu a lot of now we're going to see about some stuff long story

2051
03:08:38.92 --> 03:08:50.12
day work life looks like life's a go j p working it well a lot of cool fun people will be there

2052
03:08:50.12 --> 03:08:56.04
it's going to be a good good time um if last year is any indicators to be real good time also

2053
03:08:57.80 --> 03:09:02.84
if you want to vary up your work out you want to get some kettlebells like some someone just

2054
03:09:02.84 --> 03:09:09.96
text me today well you know on dm okay what weight kettlebells should I use okay here's a

2055
03:09:09.96 --> 03:09:15.72
thing that's a broad question yeah it's a real broad so who are you exactly right yeah it's actually

2056
03:09:15.72 --> 03:09:22.04
it's an easy answer what's that I didn't think or to the 48 kilogram once yeah yeah so

2057
03:09:22.04 --> 03:09:26.52
and potentially kill yourself or some smash it on your toe because you can hold it or it's too

2058
03:09:26.52 --> 03:09:31.32
light for you I don't know just depends so depends on how much you know about using

2059
03:09:31.32 --> 03:09:36.44
kettlebells depends how strong your depends on how big you are and it depends on what kind of

2060
03:09:37.64 --> 03:09:42.20
yeah all this kind of it well it does know depends on what kind of fitness you are trying to achieve

2061
03:09:42.20 --> 03:09:46.44
yeah I guess because you're trying to get big and strong you want to get a bigger go about if you're

2062
03:09:46.44 --> 03:09:52.36
trying to get more more metcon conditioning and whatnot than you get maybe a smaller kettlebell

2063
03:09:52.36 --> 03:09:58.04
yeah maybe medium or something like that the last point is hey it depends depends but

2064
03:09:58.04 --> 03:10:02.84
here's the thing I will say this and say this with complete bias because that because the

2065
03:10:02.84 --> 03:10:07.96
on it kettlebells on it those are the kettlebells you get regardless of what size you get the

2066
03:10:07.96 --> 03:10:15.88
Rc primal bell ones that's that's one you get either just way cooler also if you want

2067
03:10:16.76 --> 03:10:22.12
to vary up we're work out like I said no boring workouts jokka doesn't have boring workouts apparently

2068
03:10:22.12 --> 03:10:27.40
but he did he doesn't I know but you want to make your workouts interesting different movements

2069
03:10:27.40 --> 03:10:32.76
it's functional strength and actual strength there's other stuff on there starting with like

2070
03:10:32.76 --> 03:10:38.92
it's a spectrum it goes from jump ropes all the way up to what mate steel bells what's a steel

2071
03:10:38.92 --> 03:10:43.40
bell they look like a frisbee right but there's filled with metal but what do you do with them

2072
03:10:44.04 --> 03:10:47.96
all kinds of stuff right see there that's the point so there's a bunch of stuff on there anyway

03:12:43.32 --> 03:12:50.52
cinematography into the scenario you film and then you edit with music and other special effects

2100
03:13:17.40 --> 03:13:23.000
christmas spirit yeah you know unless that's why I did it but look you make a good point

2101
03:13:23.000 --> 03:13:29.40
a what you can be fair never put christmas music in one of my what do they call excerpts oh

2102
03:13:29.40 --> 03:13:37.32
now the yours oh okay I'm in it I'm in it I'm not in it I'm not in it I'm not in it I'm not in it

2103
03:13:37.32 --> 03:13:43.96
don't put christmas music in our excerpts all right you got it I promise otherwise that year

2104
03:13:43.96 --> 03:13:49.16
excerpts yeah I got to take down actually all right I dig it and you know so it's not going to be

2105
03:13:49.16 --> 03:13:54.28
christmas everyday otherwise man once that's not christmas everyday so why put christmas music on something

2106
03:13:54.28 --> 03:14:00.44
someone might may or may not listen to everyday so I understand so yeah are we did it you know revamp

2107
03:14:00.44 --> 03:14:07.08
some stuff sometimes you know listen to it everyday FYI my wife completely stuck up for you on that

2108
03:14:07.08 --> 03:14:14.52
one yeah because yeah it's nice christmas music it was released that christmas time okay I just went into

2109
03:14:14.52 --> 03:14:19.40
like hiding yeah it's kind of a bummer too because that was a really I know you put a lot of

2110
03:14:19.40 --> 03:14:23.000
time and effort into that video it took a little while so that so then when you showed it to me

2111
03:14:23.64 --> 03:14:33.08
you were all excited and and the video CGI stuff is awesome right but I know that you wanted

2112
03:14:33.08 --> 03:14:42.36
me to be just you know over the top with filled with awe at the video and I was with the visuals

2113
03:14:43.48 --> 03:14:50.28
but I was that was a lot of that was countered by christmas songs and so what you saw from my

2114
03:14:50.28 --> 03:14:55.48
reaction was actually fake yeah it was fairly fake there was a fair amount of realness there

2115
03:14:55.48 --> 03:15:01.32
and I remember it and I won't forget it because you and because you know you go let me a little bit

2116
03:15:01.32 --> 03:15:06.92
inside where you all kind of like format where it does like a certain thing and then it'll drop off

2117
03:15:06.92 --> 03:15:11.72
then it'll come back whatever so there's this part where the certain parts starts at a

2118
03:15:11.72 --> 03:15:15.64
Michael he's gonna he's gonna kind of like that part right so I'm kind of so I kind of look over at you

2119
03:15:15.64 --> 03:15:20.36
it's a super childish but I'm like looking at you whatever and you're like looking at it and then

2120
03:15:20.36 --> 03:15:25.96
like when that part hit and it's christmas music you're like kind of like as if to say

2121
03:15:25.96 --> 03:15:36.20
interesting choice instead of you know you're like oh anyway so rough we changed the

2122
03:15:36.20 --> 03:15:41.48
christmas music as a result so boom anyway that one that's a hit video of all time yeah sure

2123
03:15:42.60 --> 03:15:47.48
anyway yeah so yeah enhanced excerpts that's us on there along with of course the video version of

2124
03:15:47.48 --> 03:15:53.32

03:16:24.04 --> 03:16:29.96
you know if they want to have that option to get jockel white t and international you know oh yeah

2130
03:16:29.96 --> 03:16:34.60
I think you know just more options we're convenient for the people good call for everybody I think

2131
03:16:35.40 --> 03:16:43.000
nonetheless a lot of stuff on there uh if you want something just get something also psychological warfare

2132
03:16:43.000 --> 03:16:50.60
if you didn't know what that is it's an album with tracks jockel tracks I know that sounds like

2133
03:16:50.60 --> 03:16:54.76
okay it's kind of esoteric jockel tracks what does that mean here this what it means it means it's

2134
03:16:54.76 --> 03:17:00.68
not him seeing nothing like that so in your home in your in your campaign against weakness and we're

2135
03:17:00.68 --> 03:17:05.72
all on the path straight it's it's like common knowledge ready all of us were on the path like if you're

2136
03:17:05.72 --> 03:17:10.36
with we're listening to this even me talking you listening me we're on the path all of us one great

2137
03:17:10.36 --> 03:17:17.16
now this is inevitable I think for the most part inevitable where you know hit moments of weakness

2138
03:17:18.20 --> 03:17:23.000
sometimes you need a little help through those moments of weakness sometimes you need to just slip

2139
03:17:23.000 --> 03:17:27.96
in those moments of weakness and fall and be like I'm not doing that again sometimes that's useful

2140
03:17:27.96 --> 03:17:33.24
you learn in my opinion but in those moments of weakness where you just need a little spot this is

2141
03:17:33.24 --> 03:17:38.92
what jockel tracks are for so let's say your weakness is not getting up early you want to hit the

2142
03:17:38.92 --> 03:17:44.76
snooze so what you want to do to tie it on a note whatever maybe drink a little bit I don't know

2143
03:17:45.96 --> 03:17:49.24
so you're on the fence you're like I'm gonna hit the snooze just for what what's the normal

2144
03:17:49.24 --> 03:17:54.44
snooze 10 minutes nine minutes whatever I don't know seems to be good to tell me about that

2145
03:17:57.80 --> 03:18:02.84
there's a mud over here it's true rotten anyway actually it's not for the snooze technically it's

2146
03:18:02.84 --> 03:18:07.16
not for hitting the snooze it's for going back to bed that's the weakness that this

2147
03:18:07.16 --> 03:18:12.04
particular track because hitting the snooze is like if you just want to hit the snooze you're not

2148
03:18:12.04 --> 03:18:16.92
gonna have the energy to get up and you know boom maybe if you put it as your alarm nonetheless

2149
03:18:16.92 --> 03:18:21.16
is what it is the track it's jockel on a specific track telling you why you should just get up and

2150
03:18:21.16 --> 03:18:26.36
not hit the snooze or not stay in bed but it's like jockel pragmatic advice it's good

2151
03:18:27.16 --> 03:18:33.16
hundred percent and this goes for diet stuff skip you work out stuff hundred percent effective

2152
03:18:33.16 --> 03:18:39.88
this hundred percent that's good speaking of a hundred percent if you 100 percent one hundred

2153
03:18:39.88 --> 03:18:45.16
percent guaranteed want to be able to deadlift eight thousand pounds minimum you might go over that

2154
03:18:45.96 --> 03:18:51.32
all you have to do is drink chocolate it's that simple bro okay and the kids good

2155
03:18:51.32 --> 03:18:57.32
I'm gonna get sued am I gonna get sued for false advertising no because so in here's why so this

2156
03:18:57.32 --> 03:19:03.000
kid jociah this is an huge guy towards bicep by the way a few weeks ago maybe a few months ago

2157
03:19:03.000 --> 03:19:07.64

2158
03:19:07.64 --> 03:19:13.40

2159
03:19:13.40 --> 03:19:21.08
turns his bicep you know it happens and so he there's a video actually I think this video was

2160
03:19:21.08 --> 03:19:26.92
before he took toward the bicep no no it was after so he has this arm in his sling right when you have

2161
03:19:26.92 --> 03:19:35.08
the bicep tear so he drinks some jockel white tea with the tin pounds it and any smashes the tin

2162
03:19:35.72 --> 03:19:40.76
and I'm not joking with the actual video smashes the tin throws the tin deadlifts one

2163
03:19:40.76 --> 03:19:45.80
bad arm one hand and it's like more than I can deadlift for real in real life one hand deadlift
