00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.76
This is Jocco podcast number 112.

2
00:00:05.76 --> 00:00:08.40
With echo Charles and me, Jocco willing.

3
00:00:08.40 --> 00:00:09.40
Good evening echo.

4
00:00:09.40 --> 00:00:14.000
Good evening.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:26.12
I had a friend and some day when I can, I will tell you all about him.

6
00:00:26.12 --> 00:00:36.000
But until then for now, I will say that I could not have asked to pray better friend.

7
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.60
Did he have faults?

8
00:00:38.60 --> 00:00:40.96
Sure.

9
00:00:40.96 --> 00:00:43.84
Don't we all?

10
00:00:43.84 --> 00:00:49.96
Now most of his faults weren't really that big of a deal.

11
00:00:49.96 --> 00:00:53.72
But they were raw.

12
00:00:53.72 --> 00:01:03.80
Not because he admitted to them all openly and directly and naively to be honest, in a sort

13
00:01:03.80 --> 00:01:09.68
of pointed and heavy handed self critique, he would bear his weaknesses to the world

14
00:01:09.68 --> 00:01:16.04
and to me and to himself.

15
00:01:16.04 --> 00:01:23.04
He would speak to me as if I had no faults.

16
00:01:23.04 --> 00:01:29.56
I would try to explain otherwise, but he wouldn't listen.

17
00:01:29.56 --> 00:01:34.68
He would only judge himself.

18
00:01:34.68 --> 00:01:36.88
I'm too emotional.

19
00:01:36.88 --> 00:01:40.36
He would say, not really.

20
00:01:40.36 --> 00:01:41.36
I tell him.

21
00:01:41.36 --> 00:01:47.44
I don't know how to talk to people right now.

22
00:01:47.44 --> 00:01:50.28
Sure you do, let's say.

23
00:01:50.28 --> 00:01:55.92
I make the same mistakes over and over and over again, he would say, we all do.

24
00:01:55.92 --> 00:02:00.56
I would tell him.

25
00:02:00.56 --> 00:02:03.12
I was better than him at some things.

26
00:02:03.12 --> 00:02:06.56
We both knew that.

27
00:02:06.56 --> 00:02:16.56
There were other things he was better at than me, but he always downplayed those things.

28
00:02:16.56 --> 00:02:21.28
And we both knew that too.

29
00:02:21.28 --> 00:02:33.24
When we were overseas in a bad place, in a wretched place, he never complained.

30
00:02:33.24 --> 00:02:36.76
And I gave him every reason too.

31
00:02:36.76 --> 00:02:41.96
I put him in the worst locations with the greatest possible chances for failure and the

32
00:02:41.96 --> 00:02:51.48
highest probability for fire and fury and blood and death.

33
00:02:51.48 --> 00:02:59.60
But despite the enemy and the heat and the living conditions and the fear and the wounded

34
00:02:59.60 --> 00:03:11.44
men and the screams and the misery that was all around, he did not complain.

35
00:03:11.44 --> 00:03:20.56
It seemed at times that God himself was trying to test the limits of my friend.

36
00:03:20.56 --> 00:03:32.08
It seemed like sooner or later the bullets or the bombs would find him.

37
00:03:32.08 --> 00:03:42.88
But through some incomprehensible miracle he survived through that deployment.

38
00:03:42.88 --> 00:03:54.40
Now I make no claim whatsoever to understand why things in life unfold the way they do.

39
00:03:54.40 --> 00:04:03.40
In fact, I must say that many of the things I've seen in the world make no sense to me at all.

40
00:04:03.40 --> 00:04:10.96
Sometimes it's just utter confusion, no rhyme, no reason.

41
00:04:10.96 --> 00:04:22.96
Some of the things that I've seen have left me downright disgusted, jaded, repulsed,

42
00:04:22.96 --> 00:04:34.52
sickened by mankind and the awful and reprehensible things we are capable of.

43
00:04:34.52 --> 00:04:38.72
But there's another side to that.

44
00:04:38.72 --> 00:04:44.24
There's another side and there are other people who do their best to redeem all the evil

45
00:04:44.24 --> 00:04:50.28
our souls are capable of.

46
00:04:50.28 --> 00:04:55.64
My friend was one of those people.

47
00:04:55.64 --> 00:05:01.60
After deploying with me and surviving that bloody and violent battlefield, my friend, like

48
00:05:01.60 --> 00:05:08.56
most of the guys in my old job, he volunteered to deploy again.

49
00:05:08.56 --> 00:05:15.68
I thought and I told him prematurely and incorrectly that the enemy was done.

50
00:05:15.68 --> 00:05:17.80
I told him that the war was all but over.

51
00:05:17.80 --> 00:05:21.12
I told him just do the deployment and sit tight over there and play the game.

52
00:05:21.12 --> 00:05:24.96
And in a few months we'll be back and we can go surfing and we can play guitar and we can

53
00:05:24.96 --> 00:05:31.88
tell stories and we can cook stakes and we can surf some more.

54
00:05:31.88 --> 00:05:39.000
I told him we could carry on when he got home.

55
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.56
That was a plan.

56
00:05:42.56 --> 00:05:48.96
It was a good plan.

57
00:05:48.96 --> 00:05:57.36
But the enemy gets a vote and there was intense violence during that deployment for him

58
00:05:57.36 --> 00:05:59.56
as well.

59
00:05:59.56 --> 00:06:04.20
It was similar to what we had experienced together overseas and aggressive enemy held

60
00:06:04.20 --> 00:06:12.80
bent on killing Americans, mixed in an urban environment with a terrified local populace.

61
00:06:12.80 --> 00:06:17.08
He told me that the enemy he was now facing wasn't as tactically skilled as the enemy

62
00:06:17.08 --> 00:06:26.12
we had faced but he said that they were braver and more determined.

63
00:06:26.12 --> 00:06:30.68
That seemed to concern him a bit more.

64
00:06:30.68 --> 00:06:40.80
He seemed to feel the odds were that he would die.

65
00:06:40.80 --> 00:06:45.68
He sent me his last will and testament.

66
00:06:45.68 --> 00:06:51.28
He was not merouse about it just stating the facts.

67
00:06:51.28 --> 00:06:53.08
It's bad over here.

68
00:06:53.08 --> 00:06:56.04
The enemy is aggressive, casualty rates are very high.

69
00:06:56.04 --> 00:07:04.32
The enemy has new weapons that are extremely capable.

70
00:07:04.32 --> 00:07:08.36
It didn't look good.

71
00:07:08.36 --> 00:07:11.92
I waited.

72
00:07:11.92 --> 00:07:17.52
I waited the long and completely powerless weight.

73
00:07:17.52 --> 00:07:27.52
One known mostly by mothers and fathers and wives and children that are old enough to understand.

74
00:07:27.52 --> 00:07:40.84
But a weight also made by the brothers at home that know the risk all too well.

75
00:07:40.84 --> 00:07:49.68
It was a long weight.

76
00:07:49.68 --> 00:07:59.16
At my friend's memorial service, his brother told the story.

77
00:07:59.16 --> 00:08:05.64
My friend had talked to his brother on the phone while my friend was on deployment.

78
00:08:05.64 --> 00:08:11.44
My friend had explained to his brother in no uncertain terms the situation that my friend

79
00:08:11.44 --> 00:08:14.20
was in.

80
00:08:14.20 --> 00:08:15.96
The enemy was extremely hostile.

81
00:08:15.96 --> 00:08:17.64
The battlefield was chaotic.

82
00:08:17.64 --> 00:08:22.16
The attacks were frequent and furious.

83
00:08:22.16 --> 00:08:28.76
It was violence that my friend had not experienced before.

84
00:08:28.76 --> 00:08:38.84
His voice was war unleashed and it seemed to be heading to an inescapable conclusion.

85
00:08:38.84 --> 00:08:44.44
And my friend's brother sent this.

86
00:08:44.44 --> 00:08:54.44
Even through the phone even thousands of miles away as his brother, he sent the darkness

87
00:08:54.44 --> 00:09:03.40
and the overwhelming finality of the situation.

88
00:09:03.40 --> 00:09:07.72
And he said to my friend, do you need anything for me?

89
00:09:07.72 --> 00:09:10.08
How can I help?

90
00:09:10.08 --> 00:09:16.08
Is there anything that I can do?

91
00:09:16.08 --> 00:09:31.000
My friend was quiet for a moment and then my friend made one simple request.

92
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:43.20
He said, pray for my men.

93
00:09:43.20 --> 00:10:00.64
Now I want you to think about that level of selflessness, that level of faith and of commitment

94
00:10:00.64 --> 00:10:11.32
and of care for others, that dedication in the face of fear and violence and death

95
00:10:11.32 --> 00:10:27.04
to at that moment put others' bris before yourself to do good, to be heroic and strong and brave

96
00:10:27.04 --> 00:10:33.52
and yet at the same time to be humble and to be willing to sacrifice everything for your

97
00:10:33.52 --> 00:10:39.56
friends.

98
00:10:39.56 --> 00:10:56.16
That's a man and I couldn't have asked for a better friend.

99
00:10:56.16 --> 00:11:02.68
The world can be a horrible place.

100
00:11:02.68 --> 00:11:08.60
It's filled with violence and treachery and sometimes it seems that the legions of demonic

101
00:11:08.60 --> 00:11:14.16
powers have the upper hand and the battle between good and evil and it can seem that all

102
00:11:14.16 --> 00:11:20.92
might be lost.

103
00:11:20.92 --> 00:11:33.80
And then we remember, we see the light and for me the light comes from the example of others

104
00:11:33.80 --> 00:11:41.20
in this case, another person, another human being.

105
00:11:41.20 --> 00:11:47.88
My friend who despite all the powers of darkness stood up and rejected all that wickedness

106
00:11:47.88 --> 00:11:59.000
and proved that there is hope and there is a path to light and we can get on that path

107
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:08.68
if we choose to do so like my friend did.

108
00:12:08.68 --> 00:12:11.24
And that's life.

109
00:12:11.24 --> 00:12:16.32
At least as far as I can unravel the mystery, that's what I see.

110
00:12:16.32 --> 00:12:22.32
We are here and the best thing we can do is stand against the darkness and try to spread

111
00:12:22.32 --> 00:12:28.96
light in the world.

112
00:12:28.96 --> 00:12:36.20
That can be a very hard thing to do because life is not easy.

113
00:12:36.20 --> 00:12:47.48
In fact, it is said and there are very few that would deny that life itself is suffering.

114
00:12:47.48 --> 00:12:51.76
But there is a way.

115
00:12:51.76 --> 00:13:00.20
And there is a path.

116
00:13:00.20 --> 00:13:09.48
And today I have someone on the podcast for a second time that I think can help guide us

117
00:13:09.48 --> 00:13:17.88
down that path away from darkness and toward the light.

118
00:13:17.88 --> 00:13:27.68
Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, welcome back to the podcast for a second time.

119
00:13:27.68 --> 00:13:29.32
Thanks, Jorgal.

120
00:13:29.32 --> 00:13:36.60
You were on podcast number 98 last time and if anyone wants to stop right now, go and listen

121
00:13:36.60 --> 00:13:41.44
to 98 if you haven't listened to it yet and that's a good place to start learning about

122
00:13:41.44 --> 00:13:46.84
you and then you could also just google Jordan Peterson and go from there because there's

123
00:13:46.84 --> 00:13:53.84
thousands of hours of content of you on YouTube.

124
00:13:53.84 --> 00:14:00.48
Yeah, there's probably horrible as it is to contemplate.

125
00:14:00.48 --> 00:14:02.20
Yeah, there probably is.

126
00:14:02.20 --> 00:14:08.12
I mean, I've contributed about 500 hours probably of lectures and so on but people have

127
00:14:08.12 --> 00:14:12.76
been cutting it up and there's all the podcasts and YouTube videos that other people have

128
00:14:12.76 --> 00:14:17.16
made and I think I looked the other day because people keep chopping up the lectures and

129
00:14:17.16 --> 00:14:21.32
the interviews and making little videos and my son and I tried to estimate it last week.

130
00:14:21.32 --> 00:14:26.56
It looked like 4,000 people have made videos last week in one week.

131
00:14:26.56 --> 00:14:28.56
Yeah, it's really, yeah, it's crazy.

132
00:14:28.56 --> 00:14:30.56
It's really, yes.

133
00:14:30.56 --> 00:14:36.68
Okay, so you've got a new book out and the book is called 12 rules for life and

134
00:14:36.68 --> 00:14:45.32
an adult to chaos and one of the key points in the book is life is suffering, right?

135
00:14:45.32 --> 00:14:46.32
And clearly I think.

136
00:14:46.32 --> 00:14:48.32
I'm in the level of lens.

137
00:14:48.32 --> 00:14:51.32
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

138
00:14:51.32 --> 00:14:55.12
We need to own this on top of that.

139
00:14:55.12 --> 00:14:58.16
So you need to inflict it.

140
00:14:58.16 --> 00:15:02.96
You know, obviously my old line of work, we got to see that and we got to see it all the

141
00:15:02.96 --> 00:15:04.68
time.

142
00:15:04.68 --> 00:15:07.40
Two things, number one, where is that come from?

143
00:15:07.40 --> 00:15:11.36
And you don't need to spend a bunch of time on that because you've talked about that so

144
00:15:11.36 --> 00:15:12.36
much.

145
00:15:12.36 --> 00:15:17.000
But more important to me, what happens when people miss that point?

146
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Well, the suffering seems to be built in in some sense and it's a very difficult thing

147
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.92
to understand fully because the fundamental question is, does being justify suffering?

148
00:15:30.92 --> 00:15:32.56
It's something like that.

149
00:15:32.56 --> 00:15:35.32
And there's this old idea.

150
00:15:35.32 --> 00:15:38.28
I read this, it was a Jewish idea.

151
00:15:38.28 --> 00:15:39.88
It's kind of a riddle.

152
00:15:39.88 --> 00:15:42.44
And so it's a riddle about the nature of God.

153
00:15:42.44 --> 00:15:50.56
And so the riddle runs, what is it being who's omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent?

154
00:15:50.56 --> 00:15:54.52
So there's the three classical attributes of God, lack.

155
00:15:54.52 --> 00:15:58.44
I think, well, that's nothing, obviously.

156
00:15:58.44 --> 00:16:00.64
It's no limitation.

157
00:16:00.64 --> 00:16:06.08
And so that was the explanation for why God created everything, but more particularly

158
00:16:06.08 --> 00:16:07.44
why God created man.

159
00:16:07.44 --> 00:16:14.08
It's that there's something about limitation that adds to completeness.

160
00:16:14.08 --> 00:16:16.88
Maybe because it provides something to struggle against.

161
00:16:16.88 --> 00:16:18.40
It's something like that.

162
00:16:18.40 --> 00:16:21.68
In the book in 12 Rules for Life, I talk about what happens just happened to Superman

163
00:16:21.68 --> 00:16:22.68
in the 1980s.

164
00:16:22.68 --> 00:16:27.000
It's like Superman got so powerful that you could bounce hydrogen bombs off his chest.

165
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.28
You know, he could move planets.

166
00:16:28.28 --> 00:16:32.84
He's like, and then he got boring at the same time because what are you going to do to

167
00:16:32.84 --> 00:16:33.84
him?

168
00:16:33.84 --> 00:16:34.84
Nothing.

169
00:16:34.84 --> 00:16:38.16
He can just solve every problem instantly.

170
00:16:38.16 --> 00:16:40.12
Well, there's no story there.

171
00:16:40.12 --> 00:16:42.72
And you might say, well, who cares if there's a story?

172
00:16:42.72 --> 00:16:44.20
And that's a reasonable objection.

173
00:16:44.20 --> 00:16:46.52
Maybe there should just be no story at all.

174
00:16:46.52 --> 00:16:48.80
That's the Memphis DeFeelian objection to life.

175
00:16:48.80 --> 00:16:50.60
There should be no story at all.

176
00:16:50.60 --> 00:16:53.000
But maybe that's not the right answer.

177
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.20
Maybe it's better to have being even if it requires limitation.

178
00:16:58.20 --> 00:17:04.04
And if the limitation necessitates suffering, even if the limitation and the suffering necessitate

179
00:17:04.04 --> 00:17:06.84
evil, that's a separate issue.

180
00:17:06.84 --> 00:17:13.24
Perhaps there's a way of maneuvering through that a pathway that makes that all not only

181
00:17:13.24 --> 00:17:14.24
acceptable.

182
00:17:14.24 --> 00:17:15.44
Let's say at least acceptable.

183
00:17:15.44 --> 00:17:16.84
That would be a good start.

184
00:17:16.84 --> 00:17:23.52
But fully justifiable, something that you would voluntarily accept if you had the opportunity.

185
00:17:23.52 --> 00:17:28.60
It needs your sort of cotton on to that in some sense with his idea of the eternal return.

186
00:17:28.60 --> 00:17:32.52
He said, you should try to leave each moment of your life so that if you had to live that

187
00:17:32.52 --> 00:17:37.52
moment recurring for eternity that you would find that desirable.

188
00:17:37.52 --> 00:17:40.52
It's like, it's a high standard, man.

189
00:17:40.52 --> 00:17:46.08
But there's a very interesting point there, which is that maybe you can say that despite

190
00:17:46.08 --> 00:17:48.88
the suffering and malevolence, this is worth it.

191
00:17:48.88 --> 00:17:52.64
And I think people have experiences like that in their life.

192
00:17:52.64 --> 00:17:57.80
And you can have more experiences if you live your life, I would say, according, if you're

193
00:17:57.80 --> 00:18:02.84
on the proper path, then maybe your life can consist of almost nothing but experiences

194
00:18:02.84 --> 00:18:03.84
like that.

195
00:18:03.84 --> 00:18:09.48
Now, I say that knowing full well that people get cut off at the knees and that life can

196
00:18:09.48 --> 00:18:17.52
be very arbitrary and hard and that everyone is prone to the negative consequences of

197
00:18:17.52 --> 00:18:19.52
deceit and betrayal, all of those things.

198
00:18:19.52 --> 00:18:24.08
I mean, the book, the book, 12 rules for life in some sense is a very dark book, but

199
00:18:24.08 --> 00:18:28.92
it's not exactly because the darker the darkness, the brighter the light appears.

200
00:18:28.92 --> 00:18:29.92
It's something like that.

201
00:18:29.92 --> 00:18:33.52
And you know, you say, well, no, life's not so bad.

202
00:18:33.52 --> 00:18:36.56
You can be happy and I think no, life really is bad.

203
00:18:36.56 --> 00:18:37.56
It's really bad.

204
00:18:37.56 --> 00:18:40.76
And no matter how bad you think it is, it's actually worse than that.

205
00:18:40.76 --> 00:18:44.48
You can't really get to the bottom of how terrible things can get.

206
00:18:44.48 --> 00:18:47.40
People who have post-traumatic stress disorder know that.

207
00:18:47.40 --> 00:18:50.72
So they've hit something so bad that they cannot live with it.

208
00:18:50.72 --> 00:18:52.36
They have no idea how to live with it.

209
00:18:52.36 --> 00:18:56.04
And it hurts them, not just psychologically, but physiologically as well.

210
00:18:56.04 --> 00:18:57.96
It's very difficult to recover.

211
00:18:57.96 --> 00:19:00.32
So they have a sense of how bad it can be.

212
00:19:00.32 --> 00:19:02.24
And then they can hardly live with it.

213
00:19:02.24 --> 00:19:07.16
But I would say, despite that, and I would say also that this is the central idea in

214
00:19:07.16 --> 00:19:13.92
the in 12 rules for life is that despite that, bottomless horror in some sense, there

215
00:19:13.92 --> 00:19:22.60
is a way of being that's powerful enough to both transcend and justify that in some sense.

216
00:19:22.60 --> 00:19:32.56
And that has to do with the decision to act as if it would be better if things were better.

217
00:19:32.56 --> 00:19:33.56
That's the first thing.

218
00:19:33.56 --> 00:19:34.56
And you think, well, that's easy.

219
00:19:34.56 --> 00:19:35.56
I'd like things to be better.

220
00:19:35.56 --> 00:19:37.44
No, no, wait a second.

221
00:19:37.44 --> 00:19:42.04
There's hatred in your heart and there's resentment in your soul.

222
00:19:42.04 --> 00:19:44.52
And there's bitterness at your position in the world.

223
00:19:44.52 --> 00:19:46.16
And there's the sense that you're a victim.

224
00:19:46.16 --> 00:19:48.44
And there's the anger that goes along with that.

225
00:19:48.44 --> 00:19:50.92
And the desire to hurt, like you have all of that.

226
00:19:50.92 --> 00:19:54.96
And maybe you have it in spades, maybe it's mostly what you are.

227
00:19:54.96 --> 00:19:57.64
And because of that, you do not want things to be better.

228
00:19:57.64 --> 00:20:00.16
You want to spread some misery out of spite.

229
00:20:00.16 --> 00:20:01.96
And that's what chapter six is about, right?

230
00:20:01.96 --> 00:20:04.52
Put your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.

231
00:20:04.52 --> 00:20:07.12
It's about people like the Call of Mind High School shooters.

232
00:20:07.12 --> 00:20:09.20
And exactly what they were motivated by.

233
00:20:09.20 --> 00:20:11.60
Because I understand what they were motivated by.

234
00:20:11.60 --> 00:20:16.84
And so to wish that things were better means that you have to make a real decision that

235
00:20:16.84 --> 00:20:25.44
despite all the flaws of existence, the suffering and the malevolence that it's best not

236
00:20:25.44 --> 00:20:29.68
to become embedded by that and to work for the betterment of everyone.

237
00:20:29.68 --> 00:20:33.84
You, for sure, your family, for sure, your community.

238
00:20:33.84 --> 00:20:35.92
But perhaps even your enemies.

239
00:20:35.92 --> 00:20:39.84
You know, if you have any sense, you wish your enemies well.

240
00:20:39.84 --> 00:20:42.64
It doesn't mean you wish them victory.

241
00:20:42.64 --> 00:20:45.12
It doesn't mean you don't think they're wrong.

242
00:20:45.12 --> 00:20:46.12
None of that.

243
00:20:46.12 --> 00:20:51.80
It means that it would be better if the world was set up so that they didn't have to suffer

244
00:20:51.80 --> 00:20:55.04
miserably and futile and evenly as well.

245
00:20:55.04 --> 00:20:56.36
That would be better.

246
00:20:56.36 --> 00:20:58.36
And so then you can aim at that.

247
00:20:58.36 --> 00:21:02.24
You know, and the best way to aim at that is, well, first of all, they aim at it to actually

248
00:21:02.24 --> 00:21:07.32
sort yourself out and think, okay, well, if I could have things the way I wanted them to be,

249
00:21:07.32 --> 00:21:09.32
that's what I would want.

250
00:21:09.32 --> 00:21:17.72
And that takes a lot of psychological organization before you can state that without, without

251
00:21:17.72 --> 00:21:21.52
what would you say, without holding anything back, you know, because there's that part

252
00:21:21.52 --> 00:21:27.84
of you that better part that wants vengeance and wants to wreak havoc.

253
00:21:27.84 --> 00:21:29.08
That's there.

254
00:21:29.08 --> 00:21:31.000
It's hard to constrain that.

255
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.80
And then, well, the other part along with this, as well as aiming at the highest good

256
00:21:36.80 --> 00:21:42.48
that's attainable, let's say, is to also decide that you're going to speak the truth

257
00:21:42.48 --> 00:21:48.68
in that endeavor and to risk that, you know, and because I think those are the things

258
00:21:48.68 --> 00:21:50.68
that help you aren't yourself properly.

259
00:21:50.68 --> 00:21:54.36
That's the message on the sermon on the mount by the way, which is aim at the highest

260
00:21:54.36 --> 00:22:02.64
good that you can conceive of and act and tell the truth in that pursuit, right?

261
00:22:02.64 --> 00:22:09.72
The other element there is to focus on the day once you've aligned yourself with the heavenly

262
00:22:09.72 --> 00:22:10.72
star, right?

263
00:22:10.72 --> 00:22:12.88
Aim high and then focus on the day.

264
00:22:12.88 --> 00:22:16.80
That's very good advice, because it also embuees everything you do in your daily life

265
00:22:16.80 --> 00:22:19.20
with significance, that's the why am I doing this?

266
00:22:19.20 --> 00:22:21.72
To avoid hell, that's a good one.

267
00:22:21.72 --> 00:22:22.72
Let's start with that.

268
00:22:22.72 --> 00:22:23.96
It's like to avoid hell.

269
00:22:23.96 --> 00:22:28.56
And if you have any imagination at all, if you live in the world at all, if you're not naive,

270
00:22:28.56 --> 00:22:29.56
you know what that means.

271
00:22:29.56 --> 00:22:33.08
And it's not just the hell that you encounter, it's the hell that you foolishly produce

272
00:22:33.08 --> 00:22:35.96
around yourself and are then responsible for.

273
00:22:35.96 --> 00:22:38.32
That's a perfect, a good sort of hell.

274
00:22:38.32 --> 00:22:40.60
So you want to avoid that, for sure.

275
00:22:40.60 --> 00:22:45.04
And maybe you want to dare risking making things better.

276
00:22:45.04 --> 00:22:48.36
It's like that'll embue your life with significance.

277
00:22:48.36 --> 00:22:52.96
And that significance, you know, one of the things I've discovered learned, I would say,

278
00:22:52.96 --> 00:22:58.56
over the last 25 years, is that there's always been a mythological idea or an idea and literature

279
00:22:58.56 --> 00:23:04.44
and philosophy that there was a shining path, you know, that you could walk down and modern

280
00:23:04.44 --> 00:23:09.40
cynical people believe that that sort of meaning, the meaning that would be obtained by

281
00:23:09.40 --> 00:23:12.72
walking on that path is somehow a loseery or arbitrary.

282
00:23:12.72 --> 00:23:16.32
And I don't think there's any evidence whatsoever that that's true.

283
00:23:16.32 --> 00:23:23.92
I think that sense of meaningful engagement, that what is revealed to you when you're in the

284
00:23:23.92 --> 00:23:28.24
right place at the right time, doing the right thing, that sense of deep engagement, that

285
00:23:28.24 --> 00:23:33.76
loss of self-consciousness, that feeling that things are worthwhile, that deep seated feeling

286
00:23:33.76 --> 00:23:35.44
that things are worthwhile.

287
00:23:35.44 --> 00:23:37.60
That's the most real thing.

288
00:23:37.60 --> 00:23:41.88
I think the neurobiological evidence suggests that.

289
00:23:41.88 --> 00:23:43.60
I really do believe that.

290
00:23:43.60 --> 00:23:47.24
And so we're in a fortunate time in some sense because we can look at those old metaphorical

291
00:23:47.24 --> 00:23:52.84
ideas of the of the shining path, let's say the the golden path forward.

292
00:23:52.84 --> 00:23:56.96
And we can say, yeah, that's actually real.

293
00:23:56.96 --> 00:23:57.96
It's real.

294
00:23:57.96 --> 00:23:58.96
That's something.

295
00:23:58.96 --> 00:24:03.000
And then that's what's so cool about that in my estimation is that and this is why

296
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.28
12 rules for life is actually an optimistic book.

297
00:24:05.28 --> 00:24:09.92
It's like the darkness is real, but the light is stronger.

298
00:24:09.92 --> 00:24:12.12
It's like, wow, could that be true?

299
00:24:12.12 --> 00:24:13.68
Could that possibly be true?

300
00:24:13.68 --> 00:24:15.48
I think it's true.

301
00:24:15.48 --> 00:24:18.72
So that's a good thing to know, man, that that might be true.

302
00:24:18.72 --> 00:24:23.40
And you know, when I was talking about my friend in the beginning of this podcast, that's

303
00:24:23.40 --> 00:24:31.92
why I was talking about it because it was a guy who had every reason to be negative and

304
00:24:31.92 --> 00:24:36.52
to be dark and to look at the world and just say, this is hell, it's not worth it.

305
00:24:36.52 --> 00:24:40.20
But instead, what he really did was want to take care of his friends.

306
00:24:40.20 --> 00:24:42.20
I talked about a woman in my book.

307
00:24:42.20 --> 00:24:47.32
It's like someone I met as a client when I was just beginning my psychotherapy to practice.

308
00:24:47.32 --> 00:24:49.04
And she just blew me away.

309
00:24:49.04 --> 00:24:50.04
I've never forgotten her.

310
00:24:50.04 --> 00:24:53.92
So she had a horrible life.

311
00:24:53.92 --> 00:25:00.88
She was unattractive, uneducated, no career, unemployed.

312
00:25:00.88 --> 00:25:03.12
So shy, you can't even imagine it.

313
00:25:03.12 --> 00:25:04.60
Like you've met someone shy and anxious.

314
00:25:04.60 --> 00:25:07.16
It's like they weren't in the same universe as this woman.

315
00:25:07.16 --> 00:25:12.12
She was so shy that she couldn't walk up to people without looking at the ground,

316
00:25:12.12 --> 00:25:14.48
hunching over and shielding her eyes.

317
00:25:14.48 --> 00:25:17.52
So that's how she approached people on the street.

318
00:25:17.52 --> 00:25:21.24
And she looked like a homeless person as well.

319
00:25:21.24 --> 00:25:26.04
And so she came to the behavior therapy unit that I was working at.

320
00:25:26.04 --> 00:25:30.28
And hypothetically for treatment.

321
00:25:30.28 --> 00:25:34.12
And so what we started doing was seeing if we could get her to stand up a bit and look

322
00:25:34.12 --> 00:25:40.08
people in the eye more normally so that people wouldn't respond to her as if she was so peculiar.

323
00:25:40.08 --> 00:25:42.04
You know, so we're trying to just to change your behavior.

324
00:25:42.04 --> 00:25:45.84
But I started talking to her and she told me a little bit about her life.

325
00:25:45.84 --> 00:25:50.08
It's like she lived at her where she lived.

326
00:25:50.08 --> 00:25:55.52
Her mother was, I think she lived with her aunt who was like a violent schizophrenic alcoholic

327
00:25:55.52 --> 00:26:00.52
who had religious delusions and constantly accused her of being possessed by the devil.

328
00:26:00.52 --> 00:26:06.48
And she had a really violent and abusive alcoholic boyfriend who used to mistreat this woman.

329
00:26:06.48 --> 00:26:07.88
So that was like, whole life.

330
00:26:07.88 --> 00:26:09.80
It's like, yeah.

331
00:26:09.80 --> 00:26:13.28
And she had been an inpatient in this hospital, the Douglas hospital.

332
00:26:13.28 --> 00:26:16.36
And that was in the 1980s.

333
00:26:16.36 --> 00:26:20.20
And the Douglas hospital was a huge hospital, both sides of a university campus.

334
00:26:20.20 --> 00:26:25.52
And it had had a lot of inpatients, but they were all led out on the streets when medication

335
00:26:25.52 --> 00:26:26.92
became widely available.

336
00:26:26.92 --> 00:26:30.000
And when deinstitutionalization was the norm.

337
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.12
But there was a subset of them who couldn't be deinstitutionalized.

338
00:26:33.12 --> 00:26:36.48
And these were people that you can hardly imagine.

339
00:26:36.48 --> 00:26:41.24
So I used to go in the underground corridors in the Douglas hospital because it's very cold

340
00:26:41.24 --> 00:26:44.32
in Montreal, so they're underground corridors collecting the buildings and down there.

341
00:26:44.32 --> 00:26:46.84
There would be vending machines and places for people to sit.

342
00:26:46.84 --> 00:26:49.36
And it was like walking through Dante's inferno.

343
00:26:49.36 --> 00:26:51.68
Because these were people who were so damaged.

344
00:26:51.68 --> 00:26:55.04
They'd been in psychiatric institution for maybe two or three decades.

345
00:26:55.04 --> 00:26:59.80
They could not be released no matter what, even though that's what the hospital was trying

346
00:26:59.80 --> 00:27:00.80
to do.

347
00:27:00.80 --> 00:27:05.72
And so it was like Diane Arba, used to go across the United States and photograph strange

348
00:27:05.72 --> 00:27:06.72
people.

349
00:27:06.72 --> 00:27:08.28
And she has a whole collection of her photographs.

350
00:27:08.28 --> 00:27:10.92
They're quite arresting and shocking.

351
00:27:10.92 --> 00:27:14.64
It was like walking through Diane Arba's universe.

352
00:27:14.64 --> 00:27:15.88
And so those were the inpatient.

353
00:27:15.88 --> 00:27:19.96
And she had been an inpatient from time to time, but was well enough so she could also

354
00:27:19.96 --> 00:27:20.96
go out.

355
00:27:20.96 --> 00:27:23.44
And it turned out she didn't actually want treatment.

356
00:27:23.44 --> 00:27:24.84
She had this dog.

357
00:27:24.84 --> 00:27:26.12
She used to take it for walks.

358
00:27:26.12 --> 00:27:28.68
And so that was her source of enjoyment.

359
00:27:28.68 --> 00:27:31.88
And she thought, I really liked this dog.

360
00:27:31.88 --> 00:27:33.72
And I really liked taking it for walks.

361
00:27:33.72 --> 00:27:39.32
And maybe I could go to the Douglas hospital and find one of these inpatients and take

362
00:27:39.32 --> 00:27:40.32
him out for a walk.

363
00:27:40.32 --> 00:27:41.84
Maybe that would be a good thing for him.

364
00:27:41.84 --> 00:27:45.88
And so the reason she had come to the behavior therapy clinic wasn't to treat all of her

365
00:27:45.88 --> 00:27:46.88
problems.

366
00:27:46.88 --> 00:27:49.56
And like this woman had problems, man.

367
00:27:49.56 --> 00:27:51.36
Everything about her life was a problem.

368
00:27:51.36 --> 00:27:55.88
In ways that like a normal person just cannot begin to understand, you know.

369
00:27:55.88 --> 00:27:59.08
Unless they're in one of those situations in their life where everything is collapsing

370
00:27:59.08 --> 00:28:00.08
around them.

371
00:28:00.08 --> 00:28:04.68
And what she did, what she decided was, well, there's someone worse off that me than

372
00:28:04.68 --> 00:28:06.08
me that I could help.

373
00:28:06.08 --> 00:28:09.52
It's like, she just absolutely blew me away.

374
00:28:09.52 --> 00:28:11.68
This poor woman, she had nothing going for her.

375
00:28:11.68 --> 00:28:15.64
Well, I guess she did it because she had this nobility of spirit that was absolutely

376
00:28:15.64 --> 00:28:16.64
indomitable.

377
00:28:16.64 --> 00:28:19.32
It's just I never forgot that.

378
00:28:19.32 --> 00:28:20.32
It just blew me away.

379
00:28:20.32 --> 00:28:22.44
How lead her into her situation in a way.

380
00:28:22.44 --> 00:28:24.56
So no one wants to help her.

381
00:28:24.56 --> 00:28:27.56
Her aunt that's all crazy and you know what that is.

382
00:28:27.56 --> 00:28:29.96
She wants to help prop up her boyfriend that's violent.

383
00:28:29.96 --> 00:28:30.96
No, I don't think so.

384
00:28:30.96 --> 00:28:32.56
I don't think she wanted any of that.

385
00:28:32.56 --> 00:28:33.96
She was just one of these people.

386
00:28:33.96 --> 00:28:40.000
It's like, you know, you can put someone in a situation that's so dire that there's

387
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.40
virtually no escape from it.

388
00:28:41.40 --> 00:28:46.60
Like I've seen people in my clinical practice for whom things around them have collapsed

389
00:28:46.60 --> 00:28:50.04
so badly that there's just no fixing it.

390
00:28:50.04 --> 00:28:53.72
You fix one thing and two other things break and then you fix those and three other things

391
00:28:53.72 --> 00:28:54.72
break.

392
00:28:54.72 --> 00:28:55.72
There's just no bottom.

393
00:28:55.72 --> 00:29:01.84
And those are often families that have had multi-generational problems.

394
00:29:01.84 --> 00:29:04.56
Basically rooted the whole community is pathologized.

395
00:29:04.56 --> 00:29:08.28
The entire family structure is demolished.

396
00:29:08.28 --> 00:29:12.28
There people don't have any marketable skills and they haven't for generations.

397
00:29:12.28 --> 00:29:18.96
The whole situation is complicated by drug and alcohol abuse and heavily biologically influenced

398
00:29:18.96 --> 00:29:20.36
insanity of one form.

399
00:29:20.36 --> 00:29:24.44
Another usually can join with relatively low cognitive ability.

400
00:29:24.44 --> 00:29:27.84
It's just hell no matter which way you turn.

401
00:29:27.84 --> 00:29:30.80
I didn't see her as a contributor to that.

402
00:29:30.80 --> 00:29:35.96
I mean I'm sure she made her mistakes like everyone else but she wasn't playing martyr

403
00:29:35.96 --> 00:29:37.48
or victim.

404
00:29:37.48 --> 00:29:42.68
She didn't come into the clinic to complain, to begin with.

405
00:29:42.68 --> 00:29:46.40
She was just telling me these were the situation that she lived in.

406
00:29:46.40 --> 00:29:48.04
She wasn't.

407
00:29:48.04 --> 00:29:49.44
That isn't what she was there for.

408
00:29:49.44 --> 00:29:53.32
It's just that we thought she had come for treatment so we were doing background analysis,

409
00:29:53.32 --> 00:29:55.92
you know, an intake interview and found out all these things.

410
00:29:55.92 --> 00:30:00.40
It's like any one of those problems is enough to bring most people's lives to a

411
00:30:00.40 --> 00:30:03.24
shuddering halt and yet that was her vision.

412
00:30:03.24 --> 00:30:06.08
So the reason she had come to the hospital and she didn't just come to the behavior

413
00:30:06.08 --> 00:30:07.08
of therapy clinic.

414
00:30:07.08 --> 00:30:12.28
She had gone around pestering administrators in the hospital to let her take the long

415
00:30:12.28 --> 00:30:13.88
term inmates out for a walk.

416
00:30:13.88 --> 00:30:17.12
Now they wouldn't do it for all sorts of reasons.

417
00:30:17.12 --> 00:30:21.60
But that didn't stop her from thinking it was a good idea and it actually was a good

418
00:30:21.60 --> 00:30:22.60
idea.

419
00:30:22.60 --> 00:30:23.60
This was a practical idea.

420
00:30:23.60 --> 00:30:27.12
Like she could have taken people out on the grounds because the grounds were huge and

421
00:30:27.12 --> 00:30:28.72
walked them with the dog.

422
00:30:28.72 --> 00:30:29.72
And it would have been fine for.

423
00:30:29.72 --> 00:30:32.16
There's such a thing as pet therapy in 1985.

424
00:30:32.16 --> 00:30:33.96
That's not a huge sort of a head of a heart.

425
00:30:33.96 --> 00:30:34.96
Yeah, well, right.

426
00:30:34.96 --> 00:30:35.96
Exactly.

427
00:30:35.96 --> 00:30:41.24
But she had enough wear with all to notice that, well, that she liked the dog and the dog

428
00:30:41.24 --> 00:30:42.24
like turned out.

429
00:30:42.24 --> 00:30:43.24
That was a good thing, right?

430
00:30:43.24 --> 00:30:46.48
A little bit of love in the world there and that there was nothing wrong with taking

431
00:30:46.48 --> 00:30:50.48
the dog for a walk and that was kind of harmless and why not have someone long.

432
00:30:50.48 --> 00:30:51.72
They made her feel good.

433
00:30:51.72 --> 00:30:53.68
She thought, well, maybe it'll make the right sense of feel.

434
00:30:53.68 --> 00:30:54.68
Exactly.

435
00:30:54.68 --> 00:30:57.64
So like, you just got to shake your head.

436
00:30:57.64 --> 00:31:01.64
Well, that's when I really learned to begin with deeply that there's no correlation

437
00:31:01.64 --> 00:31:03.72
between intelligence and wisdom.

438
00:31:03.72 --> 00:31:08.04
And that's actually the case, technically like if you're smart, you can just be like,

439
00:31:08.04 --> 00:31:11.72
you can be smart and good, but you can be smart and bad.

440
00:31:11.72 --> 00:31:12.72
It's just a, yeah.

441
00:31:12.72 --> 00:31:13.72
That's it.

442
00:31:13.72 --> 00:31:15.92
Well, we used to say, okay, so we'd get these guys coming in the sealed teams.

443
00:31:15.92 --> 00:31:20.44
That would be for a while we were recruiting just the for the officer candidates.

444
00:31:20.44 --> 00:31:24.16
We were creating these guys that were, you know, they went to Ivy League schools and they were

445
00:31:24.16 --> 00:31:28.56
off the charts and 1600 on their SATs and then they were the captain of this and they were

446
00:31:28.56 --> 00:31:32.76
just these really high achievers.

447
00:31:32.76 --> 00:31:36.88
And we found that not all of them, but certainly some of them couldn't really function

448
00:31:36.88 --> 00:31:41.96
in the as a leader in the job because they just didn't have the, I guess the wisdom

449
00:31:41.96 --> 00:31:44.96
to pull it off, but they couldn't make the personal connections.

450
00:31:44.96 --> 00:31:46.36
They couldn't develop a relationship.

451
00:31:46.36 --> 00:31:49.48
The leadership's a complicated thing and it doesn't boil down just two intelligence.

452
00:31:49.48 --> 00:31:50.48
Yeah.

453
00:31:50.48 --> 00:31:51.84
And I don't want to make it sound like none of them.

454
00:31:51.84 --> 00:31:56.12
Or because some were obviously outstanding, incredible leaders, but there are some of them

455
00:31:56.12 --> 00:31:59.96
that would be the same kind of recruit, but they just would just missing whatever piece

456
00:31:59.96 --> 00:32:00.96
that was.

457
00:32:00.96 --> 00:32:03.96
Well, intelligence and character are definitely not the same thing.

458
00:32:03.96 --> 00:32:04.96
They're not the same thing.

459
00:32:04.96 --> 00:32:09.04
I mean, all things considered if you're going to pick one of two leaders, if I would

460
00:32:09.04 --> 00:32:13.28
pick the smarter leader over the dollar leader, if all other things were equal, you know,

461
00:32:13.28 --> 00:32:18.44
because, well, because someone who's more intelligent can strategize more rapidly and

462
00:32:18.44 --> 00:32:20.16
can handle more variables, right?

463
00:32:20.16 --> 00:32:25.44
And perhaps can even handle, well, can handle a more rapid rate of transformation as

464
00:32:25.44 --> 00:32:27.92
well, and sometimes that's actually crucial.

465
00:32:27.92 --> 00:32:32.12
But character and intelligence are, are, they're clearly not the same thing.

466
00:32:32.12 --> 00:32:35.92
And character is actually, well, I don't think anything trumps character.

467
00:32:35.92 --> 00:32:36.92
That's that.

468
00:32:36.92 --> 00:32:37.92
Character is everything.

469
00:32:37.92 --> 00:32:41.36
So, you know, it's interesting that you, with this, this woman that you talked about

470
00:32:41.36 --> 00:32:46.04
in the beginning, you talk about how she's, you know, she's crowd-stown and she's looking

471
00:32:46.04 --> 00:32:47.32
down with the ground and all that.

472
00:32:47.32 --> 00:32:55.000
So it's interesting in your rules, obviously, the first rule is to stand up straight

473
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.20
with your shoulders back, right?

474
00:32:57.20 --> 00:33:01.40
Well, when you get, for lack of a better word, indoctrinated, in fact, there is no better

475
00:33:01.40 --> 00:33:02.40
word.

476
00:33:02.40 --> 00:33:04.96
When you get indoctrinated into the military, that's exactly what's happening.

477
00:33:04.96 --> 00:33:05.96
And guess what?

478
00:33:05.96 --> 00:33:10.000
You get taught one of the first things that you get taught is how to stand, how to stand

479
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
properly.

480
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.08
And you know what they tell you?

481
00:33:13.08 --> 00:33:15.08
Chin up, chest out, shoulders back.

482
00:33:15.08 --> 00:33:17.56
They make you stand like that.

483
00:33:17.56 --> 00:33:18.96
There's no coincidence to that is there.

484
00:33:18.96 --> 00:33:19.96
Not at all.

485
00:33:19.96 --> 00:33:20.96
No, no.

486
00:33:20.96 --> 00:33:25.64
It's a, you could say it's a dominant stance, but that's not the right way of thinking about

487
00:33:25.64 --> 00:33:26.64
it.

488
00:33:26.64 --> 00:33:30.44
Although it is a dominant stance, the reason to adopt it is not because it's a dominant

489
00:33:30.44 --> 00:33:31.44
stance.

490
00:33:31.44 --> 00:33:33.56
It's a competent stance.

491
00:33:33.56 --> 00:33:38.20
And competence tends to make you dominant, at least in hierarchies that are functioning

492
00:33:38.20 --> 00:33:39.20
properly.

493
00:33:39.20 --> 00:33:42.76
Because you want, there are hierarchies, which is what I outlined in chapter one.

494
00:33:42.76 --> 00:33:44.88
And I say the hierarchies are old.

495
00:33:44.88 --> 00:33:47.20
They're not sociocultural constructions.

496
00:33:47.20 --> 00:33:50.76
They're not a secondary consequence of capitalism in the free market.

497
00:33:50.76 --> 00:33:53.32
All of that is absolute nonsense.

498
00:33:53.32 --> 00:33:55.20
It couldn't be more wrong.

499
00:33:55.20 --> 00:34:01.16
And as an indication of that, I point out that Lobsters, whom we diverged from on the evolutionary

500
00:34:01.16 --> 00:34:05.52
front, a third of a billion years ago, have hierarchies.

501
00:34:05.52 --> 00:34:11.72
And that the neurochemical systems, the neurological systems that Lobsters have run

502
00:34:11.72 --> 00:34:17.40
well, that mediate their hierarchical status, run on the same chemical, that the neurological

503
00:34:17.40 --> 00:34:20.76
systems that we use to mediate hierarchy run on.

504
00:34:20.76 --> 00:34:23.08
So that's just absolutely mind boggling.

505
00:34:23.08 --> 00:34:28.28
But Lobster, like a victorious Lobster, stretches out and adopts a more dominant post.

506
00:34:28.28 --> 00:34:33.000
Because his serotonin levels go up as he becomes more and more victorious.

507
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.72
And that governs posture.

508
00:34:34.72 --> 00:34:39.72
Well, and so to stand up straight with your shoulders back is to open yourself up to

509
00:34:39.72 --> 00:34:40.72
the world.

510
00:34:40.72 --> 00:34:45.92
If you're not in the defensive crouch of a prey animal, technically speak it, and that

511
00:34:45.92 --> 00:34:47.92
is the circuitry that's governing posture.

512
00:34:47.92 --> 00:34:51.96
It's prey versus predator or something like that.

513
00:34:51.96 --> 00:34:58.44
And to stand up like that is to expose yourself to the world, but in a bring it on

514
00:34:58.44 --> 00:35:03.40
sort of manner, not precisely combative, but let's say courageous.

515
00:35:03.40 --> 00:35:05.36
And your posture announces that.

516
00:35:05.36 --> 00:35:08.24
And it doesn't just announce that to other people.

517
00:35:08.24 --> 00:35:11.32
It announces that to yourself and it can start.

518
00:35:11.32 --> 00:35:15.64
It can be one of those things that can start a virtuous cycle.

519
00:35:15.64 --> 00:35:18.000
Ocaric, which is partly why it's taught in the military.

520
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Get these guys that come in.

521
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.28
They're all slumped over.

522
00:35:20.28 --> 00:35:21.48
They don't know how to stand up.

523
00:35:21.48 --> 00:35:22.64
They're looking at their feet.

524
00:35:22.64 --> 00:35:23.84
They're next or bent.

525
00:35:23.84 --> 00:35:27.72
Like, even if they're good looking men, they don't look good because they're all crunched

526
00:35:27.72 --> 00:35:28.72
over.

527
00:35:28.72 --> 00:35:30.16
You see people like this on the street all the time.

528
00:35:30.16 --> 00:35:33.48
They could be perfectly attractive, except they're completely huddled in.

529
00:35:33.48 --> 00:35:36.44
And they need to stand up and stretch themselves out.

530
00:35:36.44 --> 00:35:37.96
And then they can breathe too.

531
00:35:37.96 --> 00:35:40.20
And that's a competent stance.

532
00:35:40.20 --> 00:35:46.08
One of the things that the critics of the modern West don't understand about hierarchies

533
00:35:46.08 --> 00:35:48.12
is that first of all, they're everywhere.

534
00:35:48.12 --> 00:35:49.12
They're inevitable.

535
00:35:49.12 --> 00:35:53.68
If you're going to have a distinction of value between things, you have a hierarchy.

536
00:35:53.68 --> 00:35:57.04
And if you don't want to get rid of the distinction of values between things because

537
00:35:57.04 --> 00:35:58.48
then you don't have anything to do.

538
00:35:58.48 --> 00:35:59.48
That's foolish.

539
00:35:59.48 --> 00:36:01.96
You can't live that way.

540
00:36:01.96 --> 00:36:05.48
So I say, well, the hierarchies are based on power.

541
00:36:05.48 --> 00:36:07.000
It's like, no, they're not.

542
00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.08
They're based on competence.

543
00:36:09.08 --> 00:36:11.68
And there isn't anything more powerful than competence.

544
00:36:11.68 --> 00:36:13.20
But power isn't tyranny.

545
00:36:13.20 --> 00:36:14.48
It's not brutality.

546
00:36:14.48 --> 00:36:15.64
It's not threat.

547
00:36:15.64 --> 00:36:18.36
It might be the hint of all those things.

548
00:36:18.36 --> 00:36:22.52
Because I don't think you can be fully competent without being able to hint at those things.

549
00:36:22.52 --> 00:36:26.96
But hierarchies in the West are fundamentally based on competence.

550
00:36:26.96 --> 00:36:29.60
It doesn't mean they're not flawed because we miss the mark.

551
00:36:29.60 --> 00:36:30.60
Lots.

552
00:36:30.60 --> 00:36:34.56
And there's lots of reasons why perfectly competent people don't attain the position that

553
00:36:34.56 --> 00:36:38.88
they deserve and that they should have for their benefit in everyone else's.

554
00:36:38.88 --> 00:36:41.48
The hierarchies are tainted by corruption.

555
00:36:41.48 --> 00:36:46.52
But fundamentally, they're fundamentally based on competence.

556
00:36:46.52 --> 00:36:47.52
And that's.

557
00:36:47.52 --> 00:36:52.08
So with that, this first rule that you put in about book.

558
00:36:52.08 --> 00:36:54.24
And you're saying that's a cycle that can go backwards.

559
00:36:54.24 --> 00:36:56.72
So you don't have to have the serotonin first.

560
00:36:56.72 --> 00:36:57.72
And then you stand up.

561
00:36:57.72 --> 00:37:01.28
If you stand up straight, you'll somehow increase your serotonin over that.

562
00:37:01.28 --> 00:37:02.28
Yeah, definitely.

563
00:37:02.28 --> 00:37:03.28
Definitely.

564
00:37:03.28 --> 00:37:08.28
So you say you could inject lobsters with serotonin and they start to stand straighter.

565
00:37:08.28 --> 00:37:11.12
Yeah, you can basically give them anti-depressants.

566
00:37:11.12 --> 00:37:15.76
So like if a lobster gets defeated in a fight, then he's statistically more likely to

567
00:37:15.76 --> 00:37:19.80
lose the next fight than you would guess from a telly of his previous victories.

568
00:37:19.80 --> 00:37:21.44
So that's the first thing.

569
00:37:21.44 --> 00:37:24.84
If you lose, you increase your risk of further loss.

570
00:37:24.84 --> 00:37:27.32
But if you win, you increase your risk of future gains.

571
00:37:27.32 --> 00:37:29.04
That's a very important principle.

572
00:37:29.04 --> 00:37:30.68
It's a crucially important principle.

573
00:37:30.68 --> 00:37:31.96
It governs life.

574
00:37:31.96 --> 00:37:35.92
But yeah, if you take a lobster and he gets all defeated and he's off pouting and won't

575
00:37:35.92 --> 00:37:41.68
fight anymore because he's having a bad day and you inject him with serotonin, essentially

576
00:37:41.68 --> 00:37:42.68
give him anti-depressants.

577
00:37:42.68 --> 00:37:43.68
It's the same thing.

578
00:37:43.68 --> 00:37:46.20
Then he'll straighten up and he'll go out and have another scrap.

579
00:37:46.20 --> 00:37:48.20
And I read that, oh, I don't know.

580
00:37:48.20 --> 00:37:53.64
It's probably at least 10 years ago when I was reading about the neurophysiology of these

581
00:37:53.64 --> 00:37:56.16
neurochemical systems, that's why I go it onto it.

582
00:37:56.16 --> 00:37:57.96
It just was another thing that just blew me away.

583
00:37:57.96 --> 00:37:59.28
I thought, really, you're kidding.

584
00:37:59.28 --> 00:38:00.60
That circuit is that old.

585
00:38:00.60 --> 00:38:05.04
It's like it's that old, that's way before there were trees.

586
00:38:05.04 --> 00:38:06.84
That's how long ago that is.

587
00:38:06.84 --> 00:38:11.88
So hierarchy is a patriarchal construction.

588
00:38:11.88 --> 00:38:12.88
How about no?

589
00:38:12.88 --> 00:38:15.72
How about that's wrong and seriously wrong.

590
00:38:15.72 --> 00:38:18.60
So I was talking to one of my friends in the last year's show.

591
00:38:18.60 --> 00:38:20.000
He's got a kid that's wrestling.

592
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.44
His kid is six years old, I think.

593
00:38:22.44 --> 00:38:27.08
Dom and he says, you know, he's getting put into the higher category.

594
00:38:27.08 --> 00:38:29.28
He's kind of getting his butt whip now.

595
00:38:29.28 --> 00:38:30.92
And I'm really not sure what do you think.

596
00:38:30.92 --> 00:38:35.60
And I said, well, you want him to win because when he wins, it's more fun.

597
00:38:35.60 --> 00:38:36.60
And he has more fun.

598
00:38:36.60 --> 00:38:40.68
So now I have actual more evidence that you should get your kids in a position.

599
00:38:40.68 --> 00:38:42.80
Again, I think your kids should get beat sometimes.

600
00:38:42.80 --> 00:38:43.80
Yeah.

601
00:38:43.80 --> 00:38:47.40
But they should certainly not get beat down all the time.

602
00:38:47.40 --> 00:38:48.40
Exactly.

603
00:38:48.40 --> 00:38:50.32
I did that to my kids when my kids first started you, Jitu.

604
00:38:50.32 --> 00:38:53.52
I put them, oh, you're going to compete because I'm telling you to.

605
00:38:53.52 --> 00:38:54.52
Yeah.

606
00:38:54.52 --> 00:38:57.04
And then I'm going to put you in a higher weight class with older kids.

607
00:38:57.04 --> 00:38:58.20
Because that's going to make you tougher.

608
00:38:58.20 --> 00:39:00.80
That was my, you know, stupid thinking.

609
00:39:00.80 --> 00:39:04.24
And now with my younger start, I'm like, no, no, no, you go out and you have fun.

610
00:39:04.24 --> 00:39:07.36
And you go out and you compete against people that are somewhat equal to you.

611
00:39:07.36 --> 00:39:08.80
Maybe a little bit below you, maybe a little higher.

612
00:39:08.80 --> 00:39:10.40
But depending on your mood, time.

613
00:39:10.40 --> 00:39:11.40
Yeah.

614
00:39:11.40 --> 00:39:12.40
Yeah.

615
00:39:12.40 --> 00:39:13.40
Well, that's absolutely.

616
00:39:13.40 --> 00:39:17.48
Well, that's I think we could, we can think about that also in terms of the conversation

617
00:39:17.48 --> 00:39:19.12
about meaning that we started to have.

618
00:39:19.12 --> 00:39:22.32
It's like, if you win all the time, that's meaningless.

619
00:39:22.32 --> 00:39:24.000
Because, well, I mean, think why?

620
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Because you want to win.

621
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.16
It's like, yeah, fair enough.

622
00:39:27.16 --> 00:39:29.60
So why would winning all the time become meaningless?

623
00:39:29.60 --> 00:39:33.28
It's because your theory of winning isn't sophisticated enough.

624
00:39:33.28 --> 00:39:35.48
Because here's how you win.

625
00:39:35.48 --> 00:39:38.000
You play the game to win.

626
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.76
But while you're playing, you play in a way so that you get better at the game.

627
00:39:41.76 --> 00:39:42.76
Right?

628
00:39:42.76 --> 00:39:43.76
Because you're going to play a bunch of games.

629
00:39:43.76 --> 00:39:44.76
Well, it's even more than that.

630
00:39:44.76 --> 00:39:48.08
You play the game to win, but you play it so that you get better at the game.

631
00:39:48.08 --> 00:39:49.56
Okay, fine, that makes sense.

632
00:39:49.56 --> 00:39:51.04
So you want to push yourself, right?

633
00:39:51.04 --> 00:39:52.04
Because that's how you get better.

634
00:39:52.04 --> 00:39:53.84
And so you need competition to push yourself.

635
00:39:53.84 --> 00:39:55.88
So you need to have the risk of loss.

636
00:39:55.88 --> 00:39:57.12
Because otherwise you won't do it.

637
00:39:57.12 --> 00:39:59.64
But here's an even better way of thinking about it.

638
00:39:59.64 --> 00:40:03.88
You play the game so that you don't only get better at that game, but you get better at

639
00:40:03.88 --> 00:40:06.36
the entire set of possible games.

640
00:40:06.36 --> 00:40:08.04
And that's what you do when you're a good sport.

641
00:40:08.04 --> 00:40:09.56
It's like, well, so how do you do that?

642
00:40:09.56 --> 00:40:13.80
Well, partly, you find the proper level of competition.

643
00:40:13.80 --> 00:40:23.80
So you want to be pushed so that you will make the effort necessary to remove what's useless

644
00:40:23.80 --> 00:40:28.32
about yourself and to help foster the growth of what's useful.

645
00:40:28.32 --> 00:40:35.56
And if you do that, then you get the joy of participating in the game towards victory.

646
00:40:35.56 --> 00:40:41.92
But the extra joy of building yourself more and more strongly at the same time.

647
00:40:41.92 --> 00:40:45.84
And so when you tell your kid, doesn't matter whether you win or lose.

648
00:40:45.84 --> 00:40:47.32
It's how you play the game.

649
00:40:47.32 --> 00:40:49.60
Your kid says, what do you mean by that?

650
00:40:49.60 --> 00:40:51.88
And you say, I don't know.

651
00:40:51.88 --> 00:40:54.20
I don't know what I mean by that.

652
00:40:54.20 --> 00:40:56.20
Because the kid says, I'm supposed to win, aren't I?

653
00:40:56.20 --> 00:40:57.20
It's like, well, yeah.

654
00:40:57.20 --> 00:40:59.20
So why does it matter how I play the game?

655
00:40:59.20 --> 00:41:00.88
It's like, well, then you're stumped.

656
00:41:00.88 --> 00:41:02.96
Even though you're right, you just don't know why.

657
00:41:02.96 --> 00:41:05.48
But the reason is, is you want to tell you, here's the reason.

658
00:41:05.48 --> 00:41:09.28
It's like, we can make this very simple.

659
00:41:09.28 --> 00:41:10.44
Life is not a game.

660
00:41:10.44 --> 00:41:11.44
It's a series of games.

661
00:41:11.44 --> 00:41:13.76
It's actually a series of diverse games.

662
00:41:13.76 --> 00:41:17.84
Okay, so who's the winner of this series of diverse games?

663
00:41:17.84 --> 00:41:19.24
Because that's the real question, right?

664
00:41:19.24 --> 00:41:20.56
Not who wins a game.

665
00:41:20.56 --> 00:41:22.44
It's like whatever you win a game.

666
00:41:22.44 --> 00:41:25.32
It's like, if I hold a gun to your head and we're playing chess,

667
00:41:25.32 --> 00:41:26.64
I could say lose.

668
00:41:26.64 --> 00:41:27.44
It's like I win.

669
00:41:27.44 --> 00:41:31.96
It's like, well, that's not how full, obviously.

670
00:41:31.96 --> 00:41:33.68
So you want to teach your kid.

671
00:41:33.68 --> 00:41:38.12
You want to help your kid learn to be the winner of the set of diverse games.

672
00:41:38.12 --> 00:41:39.76
Okay, so what does that winner look like?

673
00:41:39.76 --> 00:41:42.28
Well, here's the first clue.

674
00:41:42.28 --> 00:41:45.88
That's the person who keeps getting invited to play.

675
00:41:45.88 --> 00:41:49.96
So because you win, if people invite you to play all the time,

676
00:41:49.96 --> 00:41:52.96
you have opportunities coming to you just non-stop.

677
00:41:52.96 --> 00:41:56.52
And maybe, like, let's say you have 50 opportunities

678
00:41:56.52 --> 00:41:59.48
and each of them are potentially 50% for you

679
00:41:59.48 --> 00:42:01.28
and 50% for the other person.

680
00:42:01.28 --> 00:42:03.16
You think, well, that's pretty good deal.

681
00:42:03.16 --> 00:42:05.56
And then you think, well, wait a minute, let's flip this around.

682
00:42:05.56 --> 00:42:09.28
So it's like 60% for the other person and 40% for me.

683
00:42:09.28 --> 00:42:10.64
I'm gonna be like, I'm gonna go,

684
00:42:10.64 --> 00:42:12.88
I'm gonna overboard in the generosity.

685
00:42:12.88 --> 00:42:15.000
You think, well, then what happens?

686
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.96
Well, then instead of having 20 opportunities

687
00:42:16.96 --> 00:42:20.36
at every moment, you have like 50 opportunities at every moment.

688
00:42:20.36 --> 00:42:23.76
And that's what you want for your kids is you want

689
00:42:23.76 --> 00:42:26.68
all the invisible doors around them to open.

690
00:42:26.68 --> 00:42:31.28
And you do that by saying, play nobly, right?

691
00:42:31.28 --> 00:42:34.28
Pay attention to your teammates, pass the damn puck.

692
00:42:34.28 --> 00:42:35.52
So they get a chance, right?

693
00:42:35.52 --> 00:42:37.40
Even if you're the best player on the team,

694
00:42:37.40 --> 00:42:39.12
help the people on your team develop.

695
00:42:39.12 --> 00:42:41.32
Don't grandstand, right?

696
00:42:41.32 --> 00:42:46.32
If you have the opportunity to beat your opponent

697
00:42:46.32 --> 00:42:49.88
20 to one in goals, doesn't happen very often,

698
00:42:49.88 --> 00:42:51.44
but it can, especially when kids are playing.

699
00:42:51.44 --> 00:42:54.44
It's like, well, maybe after you're up seven to one,

700
00:42:54.44 --> 00:42:57.72
it's like, back off a bit.

701
00:42:57.72 --> 00:43:00.12
You don't have to humiliate your opponents.

702
00:43:00.12 --> 00:43:03.08
Because it's what would you say?

703
00:43:03.08 --> 00:43:06.52
It's contemptible behavior on your part.

704
00:43:06.52 --> 00:43:09.16
And so, you know that because you go and watch

705
00:43:09.16 --> 00:43:10.56
a hockey game or something like that,

706
00:43:10.56 --> 00:43:13.44
and you watch a kid that really knows how to play.

707
00:43:13.44 --> 00:43:15.44
It's like they're playing like mad to win.

708
00:43:15.44 --> 00:43:17.32
They're pushing themselves to be better,

709
00:43:17.32 --> 00:43:19.64
but they're paying attention to their damn teammates.

710
00:43:19.64 --> 00:43:22.20
And they respect their opponents.

711
00:43:22.20 --> 00:43:24.48
And you think, well, that's a hell of a kid there.

712
00:43:24.48 --> 00:43:26.20
It's like, yeah, that's exactly right.

713
00:43:26.20 --> 00:43:27.96
That kid's going somewhere.

714
00:43:27.96 --> 00:43:31.64
Do kids ever show, they get so committed.

715
00:43:31.64 --> 00:43:32.48
Let's say hockey, right?

716
00:43:32.48 --> 00:43:34.28
You get a kid that's just so committed to winning

717
00:43:34.28 --> 00:43:36.76
and hockey that he's gonna lose at other games?

718
00:43:36.76 --> 00:43:38.84
Well, that's another game's in life, right?

719
00:43:38.84 --> 00:43:39.68
That's another problem.

720
00:43:39.68 --> 00:43:40.88
Well, that's another problem is like...

721
00:43:40.88 --> 00:43:42.36
So you could be over-borg.

722
00:43:42.36 --> 00:43:44.24
Yeah, well, well, the other thing too

723
00:43:44.24 --> 00:43:46.08
is that with sports, like you could say,

724
00:43:46.08 --> 00:43:49.24
well, most kids aren't gonna be NHL level hockey players.

725
00:43:49.24 --> 00:43:50.36
Like, that's impossible.

726
00:43:50.36 --> 00:43:51.92
Like, maybe you should aim for that.

727
00:43:51.92 --> 00:43:54.80
I would say probably not, because it's so damn unlikely.

728
00:43:54.80 --> 00:43:57.08
But whatever, some kids are gonna manage that

729
00:43:57.08 --> 00:43:58.80
and more power to them.

730
00:43:58.80 --> 00:44:02.16
Say, well, what are the sports for the rest of the kids?

731
00:44:02.16 --> 00:44:03.76
And the answer to that is, well, obviously,

732
00:44:03.76 --> 00:44:05.76
there's the physical discipline and the health

733
00:44:05.76 --> 00:44:06.84
that goes along with that.

734
00:44:06.84 --> 00:44:10.68
And the ability to engage in and tolerate competition

735
00:44:10.68 --> 00:44:13.72
and learn how to be a gracious winner and a gracious loser.

736
00:44:13.72 --> 00:44:15.04
But a lot of it is correct.

737
00:44:15.04 --> 00:44:17.32
That all that's part of character building.

738
00:44:17.32 --> 00:44:18.52
Well, that's what you want.

739
00:44:18.52 --> 00:44:20.52
You say, well, why build your character?

740
00:44:20.52 --> 00:44:22.60
It's like, well, how about...

741
00:44:22.60 --> 00:44:27.84
That's your set of tools for dealing with catastrophe.

742
00:44:27.84 --> 00:44:29.56
How about that for a reason?

743
00:44:29.56 --> 00:44:30.40
Right?

744
00:44:30.40 --> 00:44:33.40
So one of the things I've suggested to my viewers,

745
00:44:33.40 --> 00:44:36.40
this is the man in particular, but not just the man,

746
00:44:36.40 --> 00:44:41.40
you should be the most reliable person at your father's funeral.

747
00:44:41.60 --> 00:44:43.28
That's a good goal, man.

748
00:44:43.28 --> 00:44:45.36
That's a good goal because everyone's broken

749
00:44:45.36 --> 00:44:46.92
in a situation like that.

750
00:44:46.92 --> 00:44:49.56
And you adding to that brokenness and misery.

751
00:44:49.56 --> 00:44:52.20
I mean, you're gonna be grieving, like, no doubt about it.

752
00:44:52.20 --> 00:44:53.88
And no kidding.

753
00:44:53.88 --> 00:44:57.60
But there is a time to step forward with some character.

754
00:44:57.60 --> 00:44:58.60
You know, it's the same thing.

755
00:44:58.60 --> 00:45:00.40
You're gonna be at someone's deathbed.

756
00:45:00.40 --> 00:45:01.88
You're gonna be quibbling with your siblings

757
00:45:01.88 --> 00:45:02.76
while you're doing that?

758
00:45:02.76 --> 00:45:04.44
Well, your parents dying?

759
00:45:04.44 --> 00:45:06.12
It's like, it's bad enough that they're dying.

760
00:45:06.12 --> 00:45:07.80
That's tragedy, right?

761
00:45:07.80 --> 00:45:10.36
But you'd can turn that into hell, no problem.

762
00:45:10.36 --> 00:45:13.32
You just get a bunch of people with no character around a deathbed.

763
00:45:13.32 --> 00:45:16.28
And it's like, well, it's bad enough,

764
00:45:16.28 --> 00:45:18.36
but that turns it into something like hell.

765
00:45:18.36 --> 00:45:20.64
And that happens in people's lives all the time.

766
00:45:20.64 --> 00:45:22.56
It's like character is everything.

767
00:45:22.56 --> 00:45:26.64
So, and that's why the wise people of our past tradition

768
00:45:26.64 --> 00:45:28.44
insisted upon that.

769
00:45:28.44 --> 00:45:29.60
You say, well, don't lie.

770
00:45:29.60 --> 00:45:30.44
Well, why not?

771
00:45:30.44 --> 00:45:31.84
Well, destroys your character.

772
00:45:31.84 --> 00:45:32.96
Well, so what?

773
00:45:32.96 --> 00:45:34.92
Well, then you turn suffering into hell.

774
00:45:34.92 --> 00:45:36.32
Is that what you want?

775
00:45:36.32 --> 00:45:39.64
Maybe, you know, because people will want that.

776
00:45:39.64 --> 00:45:44.64
But I would say walk away from people like that, right?

777
00:45:44.64 --> 00:45:48.84
That's not unless that's what you want, then.

778
00:45:48.84 --> 00:45:51.56
Yeah, you've got a lot of, I mean, it's interesting

779
00:45:51.56 --> 00:45:54.24
as since I just got done reading the book, you know,

780
00:45:54.24 --> 00:45:56.16
I can hear you just hitting the wave tropps

781
00:45:56.16 --> 00:45:58.52
of all the different rules and they're all interconnected

782
00:45:58.52 --> 00:46:03.52
about don't lie or tell the truth or at least don't lie.

783
00:46:03.52 --> 00:46:07.56
And then hang, what's the chapter about hang around with people

784
00:46:07.56 --> 00:46:08.56
that want to see you do well?

785
00:46:08.56 --> 00:46:09.56
Yeah, exactly.

786
00:46:09.56 --> 00:46:11.96
Yeah, yeah, make friends with people who want the best

787
00:46:11.96 --> 00:46:12.80
for you.

788
00:46:12.80 --> 00:46:13.80
Right.

789
00:46:13.80 --> 00:46:16.76
Yeah, so, well, and it's a really, it's a real technical idea.

790
00:46:16.76 --> 00:46:20.92
So, Carl Rogers, who's a psychotherapist, great psychotherapist,

791
00:46:20.92 --> 00:46:23.72
had very much recommend his books to people, especially if they

792
00:46:23.72 --> 00:46:26.04
want to learn to listen because he was really good at teaching

793
00:46:26.04 --> 00:46:27.84
people how to listen.

794
00:46:27.84 --> 00:46:31.68
He had this idea that what he would manifest towards his clients

795
00:46:31.68 --> 00:46:35.04
in therapy was unconditional positive regard.

796
00:46:35.04 --> 00:46:38.32
And I've always had trouble with that because, well, because you

797
00:46:38.32 --> 00:46:41.88
don't treat your children, for example, with unconditional

798
00:46:41.88 --> 00:46:42.72
positive regard.

799
00:46:42.72 --> 00:46:44.68
You mean, there's no matter what someone says, you're saying,

800
00:46:44.68 --> 00:46:45.48
yeah, that's a good idea.

801
00:46:45.48 --> 00:46:47.64
Yeah, that's why it's tricky.

802
00:46:47.64 --> 00:46:51.20
Well, what he didn't articulate it, I think, as well as he

803
00:46:51.20 --> 00:46:55.44
might have, what you want to do is for your child is that you

804
00:46:55.44 --> 00:46:59.68
want the best for the best in them.

805
00:46:59.68 --> 00:47:00.64
That's what you want.

806
00:47:00.64 --> 00:47:03.44
And that's what you want from people that you surround yourself

807
00:47:03.44 --> 00:47:03.80
with.

808
00:47:03.80 --> 00:47:06.08
Now, they'll hold you to a high standard if that's the case,

809
00:47:06.08 --> 00:47:06.28
right?

810
00:47:06.28 --> 00:47:10.24
Because whenever you degenerate in any of the multiple ways

811
00:47:10.24 --> 00:47:12.48
that you're likely to degenerate, they're going to like,

812
00:47:12.48 --> 00:47:14.84
whack you on the back of the head and say, you know,

813
00:47:14.84 --> 00:47:17.92
clue the hell in, you know, you're demeaning yourself,

814
00:47:17.92 --> 00:47:19.28
you're less than you could be.

815
00:47:19.28 --> 00:47:22.32
And there's real judgment in it, and it's harsh.

816
00:47:22.32 --> 00:47:24.68
But with friends, it's the same thing.

817
00:47:24.68 --> 00:47:26.000
You want friends.

818
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.32
They're not friends if they're not these people.

819
00:47:28.32 --> 00:47:31.52
You want friends who, when something good happens to you,

820
00:47:31.52 --> 00:47:34.000
they're at, that's good for you, right?

821
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.12
They're happy about that.

822
00:47:35.12 --> 00:47:37.36
They're not like all better in resentful underground

823
00:47:37.36 --> 00:47:39.36
and like saying horrible things behind your back

824
00:47:39.36 --> 00:47:41.76
and telling you how they did something that was better

825
00:47:41.76 --> 00:47:43.44
and trying to drag you down.

826
00:47:43.44 --> 00:47:45.12
It's like that's not helpful.

827
00:47:45.12 --> 00:47:48.24
And then when something bad happens to you and you go to them

828
00:47:48.24 --> 00:47:50.88
and you say, look, this terrible thing happened to me.

829
00:47:50.88 --> 00:47:53.44
First of all, they don't try to top it with some like horrible

830
00:47:53.44 --> 00:47:56.24
thing that happened to them because they don't have the patience

831
00:47:56.24 --> 00:47:59.36
to listen and second, they're not secretly gloating

832
00:47:59.36 --> 00:48:02.56
about the fact that catastrophe finally be failure.

833
00:48:02.56 --> 00:48:04.16
It's like they're actually hurt by it.

834
00:48:04.16 --> 00:48:06.40
And that chapter is an injunction.

835
00:48:06.40 --> 00:48:08.80
It's like take a look at the people that are around you.

836
00:48:08.80 --> 00:48:13.52
And if they're not on this side of what's good for you,

837
00:48:13.52 --> 00:48:18.64
then walk away because, well, first of all, that's best for them too.

838
00:48:18.64 --> 00:48:21.20
If you put up with that, all you're doing is enabling it.

839
00:48:21.20 --> 00:48:24.32
It's like, well, it's okay that you mistreat me in a way

840
00:48:24.32 --> 00:48:26.000
that's harmful to me and everyone else.

841
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.56
It's like, actually, no, that is not okay.

842
00:48:28.56 --> 00:48:31.36
It's not the least bit okay.

843
00:48:31.36 --> 00:48:33.12
It doesn't mean you shouldn't try to help someone

844
00:48:33.12 --> 00:48:34.08
when they're down.

845
00:48:34.08 --> 00:48:35.92
That's a whole different issue.

846
00:48:35.92 --> 00:48:37.04
What if it's your family?

847
00:48:37.04 --> 00:48:39.60
So you know, you say, like, walk away, right?

848
00:48:39.60 --> 00:48:40.48
Yeah.

849
00:48:40.48 --> 00:48:42.40
Do you still walk away from your family?

850
00:48:42.40 --> 00:48:44.48
Or do you do if it's necessary?

851
00:48:44.48 --> 00:48:45.36
Yeah.

852
00:48:45.36 --> 00:48:47.60
There's lots of different ways of walking away.

853
00:48:47.60 --> 00:48:47.92
Oh, yeah.

854
00:48:47.92 --> 00:48:48.96
They'll create boundaries.

855
00:48:48.96 --> 00:48:50.32
Well, there's that for sure.

856
00:48:50.32 --> 00:48:51.20
There's that.

857
00:48:51.20 --> 00:48:54.56
I mean, you sometimes someone's on an

858
00:48:54.56 --> 00:48:56.32
incorrigible path.

859
00:48:56.32 --> 00:48:58.64
Like, there's just nothing you can do.

860
00:48:58.64 --> 00:49:00.96
You know, maybe they're aiming down.

861
00:49:00.96 --> 00:49:02.56
They're aiming down hard.

862
00:49:02.56 --> 00:49:05.04
And they're better and everything they do is to produce misery,

863
00:49:05.04 --> 00:49:06.32
virtually everything.

864
00:49:06.32 --> 00:49:08.72
And you have to detach yourself from that.

865
00:49:08.72 --> 00:49:12.08
It's like I always think about it from the perspective of a lifeguard.

866
00:49:12.08 --> 00:49:14.32
So if you're training to be a lifeguard,

867
00:49:14.32 --> 00:49:16.16
one of the things that you're trained to do

868
00:49:16.16 --> 00:49:20.08
is to approach someone who's drowning and panicking.

869
00:49:20.08 --> 00:49:22.72
And the way you approach them is you put your foot out

870
00:49:22.72 --> 00:49:26.16
between you and them and you push forward with your hands

871
00:49:26.16 --> 00:49:27.28
with your foot out.

872
00:49:27.28 --> 00:49:29.44
And you basically tell them if they're flailing about,

873
00:49:29.44 --> 00:49:31.04
you say, look, I'm here to help.

874
00:49:31.04 --> 00:49:32.56
But you have to calm down.

875
00:49:32.56 --> 00:49:34.96
And then if they cling to you, like in panic,

876
00:49:34.96 --> 00:49:36.08
you push them away.

877
00:49:36.08 --> 00:49:38.64
You think, well, that's pretty damn cruel because what if they drown?

878
00:49:38.64 --> 00:49:41.60
It's like, yeah, what if you both drown?

879
00:49:41.60 --> 00:49:42.96
That's like not helpful.

880
00:49:42.96 --> 00:49:44.64
You're there to rescue them.

881
00:49:44.64 --> 00:49:45.60
They take you down.

882
00:49:45.60 --> 00:49:46.48
You're both dead.

883
00:49:46.48 --> 00:49:48.24
It's like fail, right?

884
00:49:48.24 --> 00:49:50.88
So you say, look, good panicking.

885
00:49:50.88 --> 00:49:53.60
I'll help you out. But I'm not drowning along with you.

886
00:49:53.60 --> 00:49:56.24
It's like, well, it's the same with someone in your family.

887
00:49:56.24 --> 00:50:00.56
It's like, if they're on a downward path and you've done your best,

888
00:50:00.56 --> 00:50:04.56
you know, you've made your efforts, you've and they're not paying attention.

889
00:50:04.56 --> 00:50:05.44
They're not changing.

890
00:50:05.44 --> 00:50:07.04
They say, yeah, well, I'll quit doing this.

891
00:50:07.04 --> 00:50:07.92
Yeah, I'll quit doing this.

892
00:50:07.92 --> 00:50:10.32
They tell you the same story over and over and over.

893
00:50:10.32 --> 00:50:11.68
It's a downhill path.

894
00:50:11.68 --> 00:50:12.72
You don't trust it.

895
00:50:12.72 --> 00:50:17.12
At some point, first of all, you stop offering your words.

896
00:50:17.12 --> 00:50:23.28
That's do not cast pearls before swine, a very, very harsh statement, right?

897
00:50:23.28 --> 00:50:30.24
But what it means is, if someone, if you're offering words of wisdom to someone,

898
00:50:30.24 --> 00:50:34.56
in the genuine attempt help and they treat that with contempt,

899
00:50:34.56 --> 00:50:42.16
then shut up because you're demeaning your words by throwing them away.

900
00:50:42.16 --> 00:50:44.80
You think, well, how do you help someone who's aiming down?

901
00:50:44.80 --> 00:50:47.92
Well, sometimes you help them by walking away and saying, look,

902
00:50:47.92 --> 00:50:51.36
you're aiming down so hard that I am, despite the fact,

903
00:50:51.36 --> 00:50:54.24
you're my brother, man, it's like, you know, this is killing me.

904
00:50:54.80 --> 00:50:56.24
You're aiming down so hard.

905
00:50:56.24 --> 00:50:58.16
I'm not coming along with you.

906
00:50:58.16 --> 00:51:01.28
And the reason I'm not is to tell you and no uncertain terms

907
00:51:01.28 --> 00:51:06.72
that what you're doing is so terrible that I will even violate our kinship to oppose it.

908
00:51:06.72 --> 00:51:10.72
And maybe it'll take them 10 years to wake up to that, you know?

909
00:51:10.72 --> 00:51:17.60
And that can be the case because, you know, people often have to be hit so many times before they'll

910
00:51:17.60 --> 00:51:23.92
learn. You see that especially if someone's addicted or otherwise pursuing a pathway that's

911
00:51:23.92 --> 00:51:27.92
like seriously downhill. So, yeah.

912
00:51:27.92 --> 00:51:31.84
You cover that pretty well in that chapter where you're saying,

913
00:51:31.84 --> 00:51:34.24
there's a certain point where you just got to say, you know, we're done.

914
00:51:34.24 --> 00:51:39.36
Yeah, we're done. Well, it's like, why should I think that you're actually trying to change?

915
00:51:39.36 --> 00:51:44.64
Maybe you're just telling me, is you're, you tell me the story that you use to justify your own

916
00:51:44.64 --> 00:51:49.60
idiocy to yourself. And then you tell it to me and you demand that because I'm compassionate,

917
00:51:49.60 --> 00:51:54.80
I accept it and therefore validate your excuse. It's like, well, that like, it's really hard not

918
00:51:54.80 --> 00:51:58.40
to get tangled up in that, right? Because if someone who's really in rough shape is telling you

919
00:51:58.40 --> 00:52:03.04
about why they're suffering, first of all, they're probably about half right in their story.

920
00:52:03.04 --> 00:52:09.20
But some of its justification and excuse and blaming and all of that failure to take responsibility.

921
00:52:09.20 --> 00:52:12.88
It's really hard to stand up and say, no, I don't buy that. No, I don't buy that. No,

922
00:52:12.88 --> 00:52:18.16
you're wrong about that. You have to be a brutal bastard in order to do that. But hey,

923
00:52:18.16 --> 00:52:25.20
sometimes like surgery is brutal, right? It's brutal, but you're a lot of

924
00:52:25.20 --> 00:52:30.56
cut you open and we're going to rip out part of your body, right? Right, right? Exactly.

925
00:52:30.56 --> 00:52:37.44
Right, precisely. And so, so this chapter about, you know, only making friends with people who

926
00:52:37.44 --> 00:52:44.24
want the best for you, that's a brutal chapter. But it's right, unfortunately.

927
00:52:45.84 --> 00:52:50.80
Going to your book a little bit, I'm going to pick up, going back to that first

928
00:52:51.84 --> 00:52:58.72
thought. Standing up means voluntarily accepting the burden of being. Your nervous system

929
00:52:58.72 --> 00:53:03.92
response and an entirely different manner when you face the demands of life voluntarily.

930
00:53:03.92 --> 00:53:09.44
You respond to a challenge instead of bracing for a catastrophe. You see the gold, the dragon

931
00:53:09.44 --> 00:53:15.52
hordes instead of shrinking in terror from the all-to-real fact of the dragon. You step forward

932
00:53:15.52 --> 00:53:21.28
to take your place in the dominance hierarchy and occupy your territory,

933
00:53:21.28 --> 00:53:27.68
manifesting your willingness to defend, expand and transform it. To stand up straight with your

934
00:53:27.68 --> 00:53:35.36
shoulders back as to accept the terrible responsibility of life with eyes wide open. The reason I

935
00:53:35.36 --> 00:53:41.92
pulled that one out in particular is the feeling that you have as a soldier or as a military person.

936
00:53:42.56 --> 00:53:46.88
A feeling that you have going on an offensive operation? Where let's say you're a bad guy and

937
00:53:46.88 --> 00:53:51.84
I'm going to come and get you. First of all, you don't know. And I'm sneaking up on you and I have

938
00:53:51.84 --> 00:53:58.08
all this power, right? I feel good about it. I'm going to get you. The opposite of that is when I'm

939
00:53:58.08 --> 00:54:02.000
doing a convoy or I'm going on a patrol. We're now the bad guys are out there. They're waiting

940
00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.96
to attack me and that is a defensive posture and you're attitude about that type of thing

941
00:54:06.96 --> 00:54:14.24
is bad. Now we were train our guys that we made a specific point with my guys I would say,

942
00:54:14.24 --> 00:54:20.000
look, when you're on patrol, we're on offense. We are scanning. We are looking to get the

943
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.000
to get us to be standing up straight and to get the mentality of we want to do this and we're moving

944
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:32.80
towards the target as opposed to we're being chased. That's a big deal. It's absolutely that's a big

945
00:54:32.80 --> 00:54:39.44
deal. Yeah and that's what would you say? That's an extreme example of what's necessary

946
00:54:39.44 --> 00:54:43.76
under normal conditions in life. So what one of the things that happens if you're treating someone

947
00:54:43.76 --> 00:54:50.16
who has a phobias, like agro phobias, they become afraid of virtually everything. Maybe they're

948
00:54:50.16 --> 00:54:55.28
afraid of an elevator. It's one of many fears and so you think well. They're afraid of an

949
00:54:55.28 --> 00:54:58.88
elevator because they've actually gone in elevators and had panic attacks. So it's weird because

950
00:54:58.88 --> 00:55:02.80
what you do to cure them is to get them to go in elevators and you think, well wait a second,

951
00:55:02.80 --> 00:55:08.08
that's actually what caused the problem. So how can getting them to do that again make it better?

952
00:55:08.08 --> 00:55:11.76
And that answer is because they've gone in elevators their whole life, right? And yet they still

953
00:55:11.76 --> 00:55:17.20
become terrified. So how can getting them to go in an elevator cure them? For a long time people thought,

954
00:55:17.20 --> 00:55:22.000
well you get them to relax while they were in the elevator and the pairing of the relaxation

955
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.56
with being in the elevator taught them to not be afraid. That was the first theory but then people

956
00:55:26.56 --> 00:55:30.08
learned that no you could just get them to go in the elevator without having them relax and it

957
00:55:30.08 --> 00:55:34.08
also worked. And eventually psychologists sorted this out and what they figured out was that

958
00:55:35.52 --> 00:55:41.04
voluntarily encountering something you're afraid of is not the same thing as running from it.

959
00:55:41.04 --> 00:55:45.52
Like it's seriously not the same thing. So you say to the person, okay you're afraid of the

960
00:55:45.52 --> 00:55:51.52
elevator, let's can you go look at an elevator? They usually say yes and maybe they're so terrified

961
00:55:51.52 --> 00:55:54.88
because they're so far gone in their illness that they can't say well how about we look at a bunch

962
00:55:54.88 --> 00:55:59.28
of pictures of elevators and it's like virtually everyone can do that. So let's look at pictures of

963
00:55:59.28 --> 00:56:03.92
elevators till your board. That actually doesn't take very long because it's actually quite boring.

964
00:56:03.92 --> 00:56:08.08
So then the next thing would be, well let's go you have to have the person trust you and so

965
00:56:08.08 --> 00:56:13.28
the rule is look we're going to do some things that are going to push you like competition.

966
00:56:13.28 --> 00:56:17.04
Right. But you can stop whenever you want and we're not going to push you any farther than

967
00:56:17.04 --> 00:56:21.52
is good for you and I'll stop anytime you want. I often practice with my clients like I

968
00:56:21.52 --> 00:56:26.32
taught one client a while back to not be afraid of needles and he was afraid of needles and I'll

969
00:56:26.32 --> 00:56:33.52
tell you what that meant. He had dental surgery with no anesthesia. Right. Okay so that gives you

970
00:56:33.52 --> 00:56:37.44
some level of what it's like to be afraid. It's like all do the dental surgery but you're not

971
00:56:37.44 --> 00:56:44.88
putting that needle in there. It's really? It's like I'm no needles. So I taught him how to not be afraid

972
00:56:44.88 --> 00:56:50.24
of needles. You know and it didn't take very long but the first thing I did is said I told him I was

973
00:56:50.24 --> 00:56:54.96
going to bring a needle into the office and that was all I told him the first week is next week

974
00:56:54.96 --> 00:56:59.12
I'm going to bring a needle in here and I'm going to keep it sheathed and it's going to be sitting

975
00:56:59.12 --> 00:57:03.28
on a shelf and that's where I'm going to put it and when you come in here you can look at it

976
00:57:03.28 --> 00:57:08.32
and if you want me to put it away then I'll put it away. It's under your control and then so he was

977
00:57:08.32 --> 00:57:11.92
okay without. So he came in and there's the needle said you want to look at it and said no it's

978
00:57:11.92 --> 00:57:16.000
but canyots like I'll look at it. So he looked at it and then it said look like I'm going to pick up the

979
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.04
needle and now what you're going to do is you're going to tell me to put it down and I'm going to put it

980
00:57:21.04 --> 00:57:26.64
down so I picked it up and he got nervous like right away and he said well you put that down

981
00:57:26.64 --> 00:57:33.20
I put it down right away so we do that 10 times so that the bottom part of your nervous system

982
00:57:33.20 --> 00:57:38.64
actually knows that that's what's going to happen. Said now and then the next thing we'll do is

983
00:57:38.64 --> 00:57:43.52
we're going to practice you saying you've had enough and leaving the office so I pick up the

984
00:57:43.52 --> 00:57:48.56
needle and he'd say okay so now you say you've had enough I'm leaving and so he said that and then

985
00:57:48.56 --> 00:57:52.80
I'd let him leave we did that like 10 times so that he knew that he could just say he'd have

986
00:57:52.80 --> 00:57:57.12
enough and leave so that mean he didn't have to be a prey animal right so we're getting them out of

987
00:57:57.12 --> 00:58:03.92
that mode and it didn't take very long until well then I could bring the needle close to him and

988
00:58:03.92 --> 00:58:07.76
I say make sure you watch it you can't pretend it's not there right I'll bring it close to him

989
00:58:07.76 --> 00:58:13.28
and touch him with the sheath needle so we did that a bunch and then finally I unsheathed it and I

990
00:58:13.28 --> 00:58:18.16
bring it close and he tolerate that or stopped me and then I'd touch him with that and then

991
00:58:18.16 --> 00:58:24.24
the last part of it was that I put it under a piece of paper so he couldn't see it and then I'd

992
00:58:24.24 --> 00:58:28.72
bring it close to him right because that was that was the unknown right you don't know what the hell

993
00:58:28.72 --> 00:58:33.04
it's going on underneath the piece of paper but he got to the point where he could go and have a needle

994
00:58:33.04 --> 00:58:38.48
I took on about it was very brave of him to do this because well what had happened he got what had

995
00:58:38.48 --> 00:58:42.80
happened to him is he had a very bad experience with the childhood dentist I was held down the same

996
00:58:42.80 --> 00:58:47.28
one where the hell oh yeah held him six people held him down to give him a needle it's like

997
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.68
what was that so good it had some long-term consequences but see what happened so when you when you do

998
00:58:53.68 --> 00:59:00.80
that with people you don't teach them to be less afraid you teach them to be braver that's different

999
00:59:00.80 --> 00:59:05.04
and so like I had a client once the door is open on the elevator and she looked and she said that's

1000
00:59:05.04 --> 00:59:09.92
death like that's a tomb and I thought wow that's an amazing response and her idea was she'd go in

1001
00:59:09.92 --> 00:59:14.24
there her hardweight would accelerate she'd have a hard attack and she'd die so as far as she was

1002
00:59:14.24 --> 00:59:19.44
concerned walking in there was death right okay so for me it was an elevator but for her it was death

1003
00:59:19.44 --> 00:59:24.24
it's like okay well what do you do about your fear of death well we're not getting rid of that it's like

1004
00:59:26.24 --> 00:59:30.32
you know and you could die in the elevator you actually could probably you won't but people do

1005
00:59:30.32 --> 00:59:35.12
die in elevators and her idea was that well if anyone has ever died in an elevator in the history of

1006
00:59:35.12 --> 00:59:40.56
mankind that's a good reason for me not to be in the elevator it's like fair enough you know and why aren't

1007
00:59:40.56 --> 00:59:44.64
you terrified of out of your skull all the time because while you're wondering around you might have a

1008
00:59:44.64 --> 00:59:50.08
heart attack like that will probably in fact happen to you at some point so why aren't you terrified of

1009
00:59:50.08 --> 00:59:56.08
that at every moment well that's the mystery well so you treat people and and you see without

1010
00:59:56.08 --> 01:00:01.68
client what I eventually did with hers we went and watched an abomining she was terrified of death

1011
01:00:01.68 --> 01:00:12.24
like seriously yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right no kidding but you know so you get you don't get

1012
01:00:12.24 --> 01:00:18.32
less afraid you get braver that's better because there's plenty of things to be afraid of but you can

1013
01:00:18.32 --> 01:00:23.76
get braver so that's something people manage this on their own ever oh yeah yeah people manage it

1014
01:00:23.76 --> 01:00:27.20
on their own they'd manage it on their own all the time like you know let's say you're in a

1015
01:00:27.20 --> 01:00:31.44
ratty horrible job and you're being oppressed by your boss and one day you think I've had enough

1016
01:00:31.44 --> 01:00:35.44
and you go right your resume it's like there you go that's what you're doing it's like you know you're

1017
01:00:35.44 --> 01:00:41.12
you're because you think well I've got the devil I know and and then there's the devil I don't

1018
01:00:41.12 --> 01:00:45.44
know and that's relevant when you're when you're trying to switch careers can I find another job

1019
01:00:45.44 --> 01:00:49.60
well anyone hire me how long will this take to I have to get educated again I've to put my resume

1020
01:00:49.60 --> 01:00:53.76
together that's a real pain because there's holes in it and I don't know how to present myself

1021
01:00:53.76 --> 01:00:58.32
then I have to go to interviews and it's like oh my god that's no you know that's a lot of trouble

1022
01:00:58.32 --> 01:01:04.88
well then you think no I'm I'm gonna start that I'm gonna rewrite my resumes like well then

1023
01:01:04.88 --> 01:01:11.12
up you get right just your moving forward in your life you're not taken being tyrannized by your

1024
01:01:11.12 --> 01:01:16.64
son of a bitch of a boss and you're out to do something about it you know and people can get really

1025
01:01:16.64 --> 01:01:21.60
good at that so one of the things you do is a psychotherapist is just you do assertiveness training

1026
01:01:21.60 --> 01:01:25.92
it's like so people come and they say help help I'm being oppressed in that famous

1027
01:01:25.92 --> 01:01:31.36
Monty Python in the famous Monty Python manner and you say okay look well first of all you're

1028
01:01:31.36 --> 01:01:36.72
probably whining a lot so let's figure that out so you quit whining and then let's figure out how you

1029
01:01:36.72 --> 01:01:42.000
actually are oppressed and what might be done about it and then let's figure out a strategy and then

1030
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.36
let's help you practice the strategy until you get good at it and and let's also map out the

1031
01:01:47.36 --> 01:01:53.44
consequences of not fixing it because people think well how can I stand up to my boss it's like that's

1032
01:01:53.44 --> 01:01:58.88
terrible I might risk my jobs like yeah fair enough no wonder you're afraid of that maybe you should just

1033
01:01:58.88 --> 01:02:04.32
shut up let's see what your life would be like in 10 years if you just shut up it's like you know how

1034
01:02:04.32 --> 01:02:08.96
about it is now it's like it's gonna be way worse than that because you're gonna shrink and shrink

1035
01:02:08.96 --> 01:02:13.04
and shrink and your boss is gonna become more and more tyrannical and you're gonna hate every

1036
01:02:13.04 --> 01:02:18.88
minute of your life and it's like you want that or do you want to confront your boss or change jobs

1037
01:02:18.88 --> 01:02:24.16
it's like oh I see it's like hell here it's hell here I get it I get to pick which of those I'm

1038
01:02:24.16 --> 01:02:31.36
going to walk down and that's a relief to people most of the time it's so funny because people often think they have

1039
01:02:32.48 --> 01:02:37.20
their their paralyzed because they think that there's a good option right yeah but what are the

1040
01:02:37.20 --> 01:02:42.64
things you do is a psychotherapist to say oh no you no no you're screwed no matter which way you turn it's

1041
01:02:42.64 --> 01:02:47.44
it's like a crocodile here and it's a wolf there and and behind you there's a hyena it's like

1042
01:02:47.44 --> 01:02:56.16
there's no lambs you're not in lament territory it's all predators well pick your battle pick your

1043
01:02:56.16 --> 01:03:01.76
battle and then all of a sudden you're in battle and then it doesn't matter that it's a hyena because

1044
01:03:01.76 --> 01:03:09.20
you're warrior so fine bring it on this is a common to another point that I picked up from the book

1045
01:03:09.20 --> 01:03:13.28
that I have a leadership management consultant company so I work with companies all the time and

1046
01:03:13.28 --> 01:03:18.48
one of the topics has come up a bunch in the past couple of years is you know when you're dealing with

1047
01:03:18.48 --> 01:03:23.60
someone you're dealing with an employee and you got firearm and how this is a big hard conversation

1048
01:03:23.60 --> 01:03:29.68
and et cetera except or no one wants to have those and I always say look if you have the hard

1049
01:03:29.68 --> 01:03:34.40
conversation earlier it's not so hard because all I have to tell you say Jordan you know you were

1050
01:03:34.40 --> 01:03:39.12
late today and we're not supposed to be late and you all sorry and the problems sort of self-out

1051
01:03:39.12 --> 01:03:44.96
or it doesn't and then I got escalated yeah but what you talk about in the book is if there's a

1052
01:03:44.96 --> 01:03:50.48
problem go attack it you can go get that problem solved don't go after that drag you know the dragons in

1053
01:03:50.48 --> 01:03:55.76
there go get it well your observation is dead on it's like and this is the problem with being too

1054
01:03:55.76 --> 01:04:00.96
nice like I don't what regard nice is a virtue or if it's a virtue it's a very low order virtue

1055
01:04:00.96 --> 01:04:07.60
because what nice usually means but nice usually means is I don't want to cause conflict now even

1056
01:04:07.60 --> 01:04:12.16
though the consequences of the conflict might multiply into the future so let's say you have an

1057
01:04:12.16 --> 01:04:16.72
employee that's chronically late right and but you I don't want to I don't really want to disturb

1058
01:04:16.72 --> 01:04:20.000
them I don't want to cause any trouble it's like while you're angry about it because they're late

1059
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.68
and they're not supposed to be so you're getting all bitter and resentful plus you're not doing

1060
01:04:23.68 --> 01:04:28.32
the many favors you know because you're also telling them that you can be taken advantage of

1061
01:04:28.32 --> 01:04:33.04
and that they're lack of discipline is okay and then you know so then you're going to dislike the

1062
01:04:33.04 --> 01:04:38.40
employee and you're going to amplify their other errors in your because of your distaste and then

1063
01:04:38.40 --> 01:04:41.84
and if they are someone who's taking advantage of you then they're going to take advantage of you

1064
01:04:41.84 --> 01:04:45.36
a little more and then a little more and a little more and a little more and then you're going to have

1065
01:04:45.36 --> 01:04:50.48
to have a really difficult conversation or put up with it and that might sink your business especially

1066
01:04:50.48 --> 01:04:57.12
if you're a small business owner so by not confronting the dragon when it's like two inches high

1067
01:04:57.12 --> 01:05:02.24
and can only you know it's like it can bell-chowed something like a bit lighter you wait till

1068
01:05:02.24 --> 01:05:06.64
the thing can inflame the whole room and then you say oh my god like isn't this hellish it's like well

1069
01:05:07.44 --> 01:05:13.60
you knew that there was something to say you knew it you knew it a thousand times and now

1070
01:05:14.32 --> 01:05:18.32
you can't just say the one thing you have to say the thousand things or maybe you have to say the

1071
01:05:18.32 --> 01:05:24.08
ten thousand things and it's just destructive in every way so yeah that's not good

1072
01:05:24.08 --> 01:05:31.84
now here's where I need help with this so what I think people might get the ideas okay if

1073
01:05:31.84 --> 01:05:38.40
I'm in a relationship with my wife and she gives serves me dry chicken again right which is

1074
01:05:38.40 --> 01:05:43.28
a common theme in my house and actually thanks to the internet it's actually changed now

1075
01:05:43.28 --> 01:05:47.36
because she's gotten thousands of people that haven't now sent her how to keep the chicken more

1076
01:05:47.36 --> 01:05:52.56
so she does a great job but for for you know we're talking about two decades of my life we're

1077
01:05:52.56 --> 01:05:58.24
talking about dry chicken this is a problem so and you know what I did I didn't say anything

1078
01:05:58.24 --> 01:06:04.16
because I just would drink more water yeah more water at dinner yeah I fear that sometimes people

1079
01:06:04.16 --> 01:06:06.72
say well you know what I'm gonna do so I'm just gonna run around it I'm gonna tell the truth to

1080
01:06:06.72 --> 01:06:12.80
everyone all the time on these little things that don't matter now my my my actual best example

1081
01:06:12.80 --> 01:06:17.76
that I've ever heard of this we we had a guy in the podcast named Charlie Plum he was a pilot in

1082
01:06:17.76 --> 01:06:25.60
Vietnam he was shot down in and on his last mission of his deployment he was shot down he was captured

1083
01:06:25.60 --> 01:06:32.88
using the honeyhilton for six years this is the deal that they had amongst their roommates so they

1084
01:06:32.88 --> 01:06:36.64
had roommates and it's run smaller than we're in right now and there'd be four of them in there

1085
01:06:36.64 --> 01:06:40.56
three of them and they're two from there depending on what's going on if you did something

1086
01:06:40.56 --> 01:06:45.92
then normally if Jordan does something that annoys me we gotta live together if you do something

1087
01:06:45.92 --> 01:06:52.72
that annoys me it's my fault it's my fault for allowing you clip clip click your nails together

1088
01:06:52.72 --> 01:06:56.88
or you pick your nose a lot or you itch your head whatever it is that you do that bothers me

1089
01:06:56.88 --> 01:07:03.04
it's my problem and I have to absorb it because otherwise what we have is we have like rats and

1090
01:07:03.04 --> 01:07:09.12
a cage that are gonna knowledge other apart and I thought about that while I was reading the

1091
01:07:09.12 --> 01:07:14.000
part of the book that was saying and you actually also later in the book talk about hey you know

1092
01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.08
you're gonna get fight over this little stupid thing or you're gonna absorb and I talk about that

1093
01:07:18.08 --> 01:07:24.24
a lot as a leader yeah as a as a person in a relationship hey there's problems from your boss

1094
01:07:24.96 --> 01:07:29.04
you absorb them and you don't pass them down to your people you know you you want to stay

1095
01:07:29.04 --> 01:07:32.80
work or stay late and do a much crazy stuff that we don't think we should be doing cool my

1096
01:07:32.80 --> 01:07:37.60
guys are gonna go home I'm gonna absorb that I'll get it done myself I'm not gonna absorb these problems

1097
01:07:37.60 --> 01:07:42.56
now are there some tertiary effects of course or secondary effects that know my boss thinks

1098
01:07:42.56 --> 01:07:47.76
you can get away with that and all those things but I just think there's we have to be careful

1099
01:07:47.76 --> 01:07:53.12
that we're not just throwing a lot of spears of truth in people's hands or whatever is

1100
01:07:53.12 --> 01:07:57.60
a bunch of black truths they're the opposite of white lies right so black truths are truth

1101
01:07:57.60 --> 01:08:04.24
you used to hurt other people with right so technically in the moment the statement is factual

1102
01:08:04.24 --> 01:08:09.28
but the context be lies right whereas a white lie it's like well it's a little lie but you're

1103
01:08:09.28 --> 01:08:14.32
trying to support a larger truth not that white white lies aren't optimal you know it's better

1104
01:08:14.32 --> 01:08:19.36
not to lie but sometimes the best you can manage is a white lie and then maybe that's better

1105
01:08:19.36 --> 01:08:25.12
pretty good well okay so then in those sorts of situations you think well first of all I have

1106
01:08:25.12 --> 01:08:31.12
some rules of thumb if someone does something at work that annoys you it's like right it off man

1107
01:08:31.12 --> 01:08:35.68
it's like that's once it's like what does that mean you're having a bad day or I'm having

1108
01:08:35.68 --> 01:08:42.64
a bad day it's like doesn't mean anything do it twice think it's okay that's right that off

1109
01:08:42.64 --> 01:08:48.000
right that off it's that's the same issue it could still just be circumstance in situation

1110
01:08:49.04 --> 01:08:54.56
three times okay now there might be grounds for a conversation you go and say well you know

1111
01:08:54.56 --> 01:09:00.72
you put your feet up on my desk like but they ago and that was okay but then you did it again

1112
01:09:00.72 --> 01:09:07.36
and then like you did it again and I'm thinking it actually happened three times right so there's

1113
01:09:07.36 --> 01:09:12.32
no denying it and perhaps that's not optimal and then you go for the smallest possible

1114
01:09:12.32 --> 01:09:18.80
victory that's the next thing is like I'm not telling you that you're what would you say

1115
01:09:18.80 --> 01:09:24.24
that you lack respect or that there's something wrong with you what I'm asking is that if you come

1116
01:09:24.24 --> 01:09:32.48
in my office it would be better for both of us if your feet stayed on the floor that okay

1117
01:09:33.04 --> 01:09:37.84
you know and and that's a small thing you're not going after the person's character right you're

1118
01:09:37.84 --> 01:09:42.08
going after the tiny victory so you say to your wife look like I'm thrilled to death that you're

1119
01:09:42.08 --> 01:09:47.36
cooking me dinner really I'm serious because and it could be a hell of lot worse than it is you know

1120
01:09:47.36 --> 01:09:52.48
and and maybe I could be more helpful around the kitchen that's certainly a possibility

1121
01:09:53.20 --> 01:09:58.48
but I have to go out this thing with regards to chicken and maybe it's me you know but could we

1122
01:09:58.48 --> 01:10:04.16
try for like a month to cook it differently and then we'll revisit it and if I happen to be wrong

1123
01:10:04.16 --> 01:10:08.96
like I'll shut the hell up and she might think okay well he is kind of useless around the

1124
01:10:08.96 --> 01:10:15.44
kitchen and sort of bitchy about the chicken and all of that but maybe I trust him enough to admit

1125
01:10:15.44 --> 01:10:20.000
that I made a small mistake and rectify it and we could go along and not have the damn chicken thing

1126
01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.48
hanging over our heads till we're 80 you know you just in your second example there you I tell

1127
01:10:26.48 --> 01:10:30.08
people it's all the time so you you're coming into my office and you're putting your feet in the

1128
01:10:30.08 --> 01:10:36.88
desk what I'll generally do is make it my fault I generally say hey Jordan I hate to be like a

1129
01:10:36.88 --> 01:10:42.24
nitpicker yeah but I'm really freaked out about germs it's really stupid but yeah and when you

1130
01:10:42.24 --> 01:10:46.16
come and put your feet on my desk it freaks me out yeah you just do me a favor and not put your

1131
01:10:46.16 --> 01:10:50.40
feet on your knees I was thinking of the same thing with you know with the chicken it's like hey

1132
01:10:50.40 --> 01:10:55.60
you know what I have a super sensitive palate refined and I just do the rough minds just to

1133
01:10:55.60 --> 01:11:01.92
refine for your story but and I just yeah could we maybe figure out another way to cook that

1134
01:11:01.92 --> 01:11:09.12
or okay we try you know but I'll take the blame for for the situation rather than your

1135
01:11:09.12 --> 01:11:12.96
your disrespect for don't put your feet on my desk this is you know well you don't want to

1136
01:11:12.96 --> 01:11:19.76
adopt more of a position of moral superiority than is absolutely necessary one of the things I

1137
01:11:19.76 --> 01:11:24.24
recommend I don't remember if I wrote it into all rules for life I think I did about how to

1138
01:11:24.24 --> 01:11:29.04
let's say you're in an intractable argument with your wife about who's the most reprehensible

1139
01:11:29.04 --> 01:11:35.20
person right which is where arguments sort of end when they go to hell I think now you're in

1140
01:11:35.20 --> 01:11:40.48
one of those arguments and you risk bringing up the past which is a very very bad idea right

1141
01:11:40.48 --> 01:11:45.12
maybe you're saying something like you've always been this way you're this way down you'll never

1142
01:11:45.12 --> 01:11:49.28
change and none of it's good it's like oh man that's a fight because where where are you going to

1143
01:11:49.28 --> 01:11:53.44
go from there so one of the things I recommend and this actually works is when you're in one of

1144
01:11:53.44 --> 01:11:57.92
these battles and you can't bloody well get out of it you separate each go to your room and you

1145
01:11:57.92 --> 01:12:02.88
sit and think okay that person is really wrong and I like to give them a good stomping and

1146
01:12:02.88 --> 01:12:06.80
but then you think no I got to live with them so that's probably not a good idea right because I

1147
01:12:06.80 --> 01:12:10.08
don't want to live with someone who's like stomped and angry about it because they're going to

1148
01:12:10.08 --> 01:12:15.12
take their revenge like if they have any spirit at all so you cannot win an argument with your wife

1149
01:12:15.12 --> 01:12:21.68
that's just wrong you can't you can make peace you can come up with a solution but if you win

1150
01:12:21.68 --> 01:12:28.16
she loses and then she's the loser and like unless you want to have a loser around that's not

1151
01:12:28.16 --> 01:12:34.24
a very good strategy anyway so you go to your room and you think okay fundamentally flawed as my

1152
01:12:34.24 --> 01:12:39.52
wife is particularly in this particular circumstance there's probably something stupid

1153
01:12:39.52 --> 01:12:45.20
idea in the relatively recent past that increased the probability that we're in this little

1154
01:12:45.20 --> 01:12:50.56
hellish place and you think oh what was it and you think oh god I really don't want to know

1155
01:12:50.56 --> 01:12:56.16
it's like I really don't want to know this and so you think no I'm going to figure out where I'm one

1156
01:12:56.16 --> 01:13:02.24
percent at fault she's 99% wrong but I'm I'm 1% at fault so you sit there and you think okay what

1157
01:13:02.24 --> 01:13:08.40
was it and you let your imagination sort of wander over your past stupidities and you think oh

1158
01:13:08.96 --> 01:13:13.76
there is something I did that was like kind of underhanded and devious and crooked and pathetic and

1159
01:13:13.76 --> 01:13:19.52
weasely and then you go and you tell her and she does the same thing you know and she's just

1160
01:13:19.52 --> 01:13:24.000
irritated about it as you are and then you think okay and you say look I'm sorry about that and

1161
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.20
I know this increased the probability that we're in this like bitchy horrible place and she does the

1162
01:13:29.20 --> 01:13:33.52
same thing and then you think oh yeah well we're both pathetic losers and we can quit plan

1163
01:13:33.52 --> 01:13:37.36
like dominance hierarchy and then maybe you can have a conversation about how to make it better

1164
01:13:37.36 --> 01:13:41.52
and that conversation should be bounded too it's like the chicken thing is a really good

1165
01:13:42.24 --> 01:13:48.48
my my father-in-law who I really like used to come my wife told me this story he used to come

1166
01:13:48.48 --> 01:13:54.56
home for lunch eh and his wife would feed him lunch and she always used little plates and it was

1167
01:13:54.56 --> 01:14:00.64
like they'd been married for 30 years and one day he had this explosion at the table about the fact

1168
01:14:00.64 --> 01:14:06.72
that he'd had to eat off these damn little plates for 30 years and you know it was much more of a

1169
01:14:07.76 --> 01:14:12.64
large explosion than it had to be but it's these little things actually matter they actually

1170
01:14:12.64 --> 01:14:17.36
matter they have to straighten them out because your life especially with your wife is composed of

1171
01:14:17.36 --> 01:14:23.44
about 50 little things that you do every day and because you do them every day they're not little

1172
01:14:24.32 --> 01:14:27.44
you can just do the arithmetic you know it's like maybe you don't like

1173
01:14:27.44 --> 01:14:32.88
where your wife greets you when you come home it's like okay is that relevant is that important well

1174
01:14:33.28 --> 01:14:37.12
let's say it takes 10 minutes because you're thinking about it and you're coming home and then there's

1175
01:14:37.12 --> 01:14:41.68
the little aftermath of it's 10 minutes so it's like an hour a week it's four hours a month it's 50

1176
01:14:41.68 --> 01:14:47.04
hours a year that's one work week it's 2% of your life it's like 2% of your life right so that's

1177
01:14:47.04 --> 01:14:53.60
the math it's like if you got 50 of those things right your whole life would be right think is it

1178
01:14:53.60 --> 01:14:58.64
worth fighting about just like yeah it's worth it because it's 2% of your life or which one percent

1179
01:14:58.64 --> 01:15:04.000
even whatever and then you think okay well how should people greet themselves when they first

1180
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.36
come home it's like well maybe it's not quite like your dog greets you because your dog is like

1181
01:15:09.36 --> 01:15:15.04
reprehensively happy to see that's just too much right little candle do that but maybe you want

1182
01:15:15.04 --> 01:15:21.04
the person to not be watching TV for the second you enter the house maybe they should just stop

1183
01:15:21.04 --> 01:15:25.36
watching TV and come and say you know hello how was your day and give you a hug that would be a

1184
01:15:25.36 --> 01:15:30.16
good thing and then maybe you do the same thing to them and you practice that for like two months

1185
01:15:30.16 --> 01:15:34.08
because you're both stupid and it's really hard for you to learn anything and then you've got that

1186
01:15:34.08 --> 01:15:39.28
down and the dinner times are like that too like a lot and lots of households meal times are really

1187
01:15:39.28 --> 01:15:45.92
fractured which is a bad thing or they're bitter it's like I'm here's your goddamn food it's like

1188
01:15:45.92 --> 01:15:50.96
yeah I'll eat it but I can't stand it and you can't cook it's like okay that's four and a half hours

1189
01:15:50.96 --> 01:15:56.80
a day right for your whole life you think you're gonna like someone like that not a bit man you know

1190
01:15:56.80 --> 01:16:01.84
I'd do like them so you fix that you actually did tell that whole thing in the book so that's

1191
01:16:01.84 --> 01:16:06.000
it's good is in there and actually the phrasing that you used when you say if you win an argument

1192
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:11.20
you said something along the lines of you win you win that argument they're the loser yeah

1193
01:16:11.20 --> 01:16:16.48
now you win that argument a hundred times now in a marriage you win ten thousand times and you

1194
01:16:16.48 --> 01:16:23.44
are now married to a loser and that loser that loser is not going to be someone who makes any effort

1195
01:16:23.44 --> 01:16:30.56
whatsoever ever to be attractive to you or anyone else then you'll think oh look look look look

1196
01:16:30.56 --> 01:16:38.48
who I ended up with it's like no look at how you produced it's like good work there it's guy and

1197
01:16:38.48 --> 01:16:43.04
that's the so so what you're talking about with this argument thing and you look go but you

1198
01:16:43.04 --> 01:16:47.68
separate you go in your room you say okay what did I do wrong yeah right I do wrong that's annoying

1199
01:16:47.68 --> 01:16:53.20
what did I do wrong and and interestingly myself and my my my buddy life babbling we wrote a book

1200
01:16:53.20 --> 01:16:58.64
called Extreme ownership and I mean whole premises you take responsibility for when things go wrong

1201
01:16:58.64 --> 01:17:04.72
you say yeah this was my fault so I'll go to clients and I'll be meeting with them and I'll say

1202
01:17:04.72 --> 01:17:07.76
you look when you something goes wrong with your team you're with me you guys made a mistake you fail

1203
01:17:07.76 --> 01:17:11.12
up whatever you're trying to accomplish you know you gotta take ownership of you stand up and you

1204
01:17:11.12 --> 01:17:17.12
say hey look this was my fault and this is what you know we're gonna do and then the people will

1205
01:17:17.12 --> 01:17:22.64
say well you know what if I did that my team is so bad yeah that if I did that with my team you know

1206
01:17:22.64 --> 01:17:28.24
what they'd say they'd say you're right it is your fault and and it looked at me like well

1207
01:17:28.24 --> 01:17:33.28
the so you're plan jocco sucks yeah because if I say this is my fault my team is gonna look at

1208
01:17:33.28 --> 01:17:39.44
me and say you're right it is your fault and then what do I do and I kind of get a little bit

1209
01:17:40.48 --> 01:17:47.84
maybe a little bit frustrated because I look at them and I say that's the whole point it actually

1210
01:17:47.84 --> 01:17:53.20
is your fault you're not just saying it to get out of the the problem you're not just saying it

1211
01:17:53.20 --> 01:17:57.84
to make excuses for everything that's happening no when you say hey this is my fault that we

1212
01:17:57.84 --> 01:18:02.88
got in this argument and then your and your wife says yeah it is you don't say no no no no no no you

1213
01:18:02.88 --> 01:18:09.12
say I know and you have to mean it is you say I know and this is what I'm gonna do to fix it and

1214
01:18:09.12 --> 01:18:11.92
if you're a leader you say it's my fault and your team says yeah you're right it is your fault you

1215
01:18:11.92 --> 01:18:16.80
say I know that's what I just said and here's what I'm gonna do to fix it so when you take ownership

1216
01:18:16.80 --> 01:18:21.12
of a problem it doesn't necessarily make the problem go away in fact it doesn't do that at all

1217
01:18:21.12 --> 01:18:24.72
once you admit what the problem is and you take ownership of the problem then you have to say

1218
01:18:24.72 --> 01:18:30.24
here's what I'm gonna do to fix it let's say your high school kid and you got a tyrant as a

1219
01:18:30.24 --> 01:18:34.96
teacher it's like well you could it could be the case that you have a tyrant as a teacher and the

1220
01:18:34.96 --> 01:18:38.80
tyrant is particularly on your case and you think well yeah that's an awful thing and this

1221
01:18:38.80 --> 01:18:43.68
person really is a tyrant it's like yeah but you're not very good at dealing with tyrants

1222
01:18:43.68 --> 01:18:48.000
you might think well I shouldn't have to be it's like fair enough man because who wants tyrants

1223
01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:55.60
but truth of the matter is is that there is always tyranny and if you don't know how to deal with it

1224
01:18:55.60 --> 01:19:01.28
if you don't know how to thrive in the face of tyranny even then there is something wrong with you

1225
01:19:01.28 --> 01:19:05.20
now doesn't mean that there isn't something wrong with the tyrant it's like that's self-evident

1226
01:19:05.20 --> 01:19:10.88
but it doesn't mean that you aren't who you could be because if you were everything you could be

1227
01:19:10.88 --> 01:19:15.60
you could manage that situation and it might be you'd figure out an exit strategy I mean who the

1228
01:19:15.60 --> 01:19:21.12
hell knows what the solution would be but if you if you're conceiving yourself as helpless

1229
01:19:21.12 --> 01:19:26.32
victim then that's what you are and I'm not saying that there aren't situations that people find

1230
01:19:26.32 --> 01:19:33.04
themselves in where there's very well it's hard to say you know that there's very little you can

1231
01:19:33.04 --> 01:19:37.20
do I mean that woman that we talked about earlier she was in a pretty damn hopeless situation

1232
01:19:37.20 --> 01:19:41.60
and she found something she could do you know and I've read these books Victor Frankles

1233
01:19:41.60 --> 01:19:46.48
man search for meaning and social netizens go like archipelago I mean he saw people in some pretty

1234
01:19:46.48 --> 01:19:53.92
damn dire straits like really you know really beyond comprehension and he noticed even in

1235
01:19:53.92 --> 01:19:58.96
those situations that people still have their choices to make you know and I mean you you

1236
01:19:58.96 --> 01:20:03.36
tread on that ground with extreme hesitancy because you don't say well man if I was thrown in the

1237
01:20:03.36 --> 01:20:07.92
go like I would have been noble it's like no probably not man you would have been a trusty in about

1238
01:20:07.92 --> 01:20:12.32
15 minutes you know that's the most likely outcome so you have to be careful about not

1239
01:20:12.32 --> 01:20:17.92
getting too high on your horse about such things but it isn't obvious when you're out of choices

1240
01:20:17.92 --> 01:20:24.000
most of the time you have more choices you haven't used all the choices you have most of the time

1241
01:20:24.56 --> 01:20:29.92
now I've seen people in situations I couldn't help them get out of so and people die right

1242
01:20:29.92 --> 01:20:34.40
I mean you have a fatal illness you have pancreatic cancer like you're dead in six months your

1243
01:20:34.40 --> 01:20:39.92
choices are limited but maybe under those circumstances you figure out how to put your house in order

1244
01:20:40.48 --> 01:20:46.72
and be what you can to the people who will be left it's something like that from for me and I

1245
01:20:46.72 --> 01:20:51.28
get a lot of and I know you get infinitely more than me but I'll get someone that reports to me

1246
01:20:51.28 --> 01:20:57.28
a problem or a situation that they're in that seems really bad and and what I've found is

1247
01:20:57.28 --> 01:21:04.80
the solution that they're looking for the only solution that they can conceive of is one that is

1248
01:21:04.80 --> 01:21:10.40
going to provide that solution within a two week time frame like that's what we're talking about

1249
01:21:10.40 --> 01:21:16.000
if I'm not this problem is installed in two weeks then you know this is hell and I always kind

1250
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:22.000
of report back and say hey you're here in a job right now that I understand it's bad I understand

1251
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.48
it's your boss's terrible the team is terrible whatever the case is what it or you're in a

1252
01:21:26.48 --> 01:21:32.000
situation or your family is this or whatever so conceive of plan right now and it's not going to take

1253
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:36.88
two weeks it might take six months it might take a year it might take a year and a half of you

1254
01:21:36.88 --> 01:21:41.20
saving your money and setting your resume and getting the service skills that you need if you can

1255
01:21:41.20 --> 01:21:46.32
if you can extend your time and I'll tell you what when you when you come up with that plan when you

1256
01:21:46.32 --> 01:21:54.000
conceive of that plan immediately you have hope and when you have hope you can continue on through

1257
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.12
the miserable existence that you're in because you know that you've got a plan and you're going to

1258
01:21:57.12 --> 01:22:01.44
get your way out of it absolutely well I had a client recently because I've done a lot of consulting

1259
01:22:01.44 --> 01:22:06.08
as well it's clinical work and often my clients come to me they're high functioning people they

1260
01:22:06.08 --> 01:22:12.08
have decent jobs but you know we make a plan it's like well I'm making 75 thousand dollars a year

1261
01:22:12.08 --> 01:22:16.64
right now the person says so well how much well okay we're going to we're going to prove that like

1262
01:22:16.64 --> 01:22:20.64
why don't we see if we can triple that see if we can triple it it's like what the hell you know

1263
01:22:20.64 --> 01:22:27.04
maybe we can't but maybe we can some people do make triple that could be you okay so what's wrong

1264
01:22:27.04 --> 01:22:32.24
with you well you know you're not educated enough all right so we need to fix that your resume is

1265
01:22:32.24 --> 01:22:37.52
in order you're not sending the damn thing out it's like well then you got to do baselines

1266
01:22:37.52 --> 01:22:41.84
statistics it's like well how many times do you have to send out your resume to to move ahead

1267
01:22:41.84 --> 01:22:46.80
when you're already in a pretty decent job well the answer isn't 10 the answer is like you have

1268
01:22:46.80 --> 01:22:53.68
to send out five a day every day for the next two years and the the rejection rate will be so

1269
01:22:53.68 --> 01:22:59.84
close to a hundred percent that that's what it will feel like right but it's a lottery ticket you

1270
01:22:59.84 --> 01:23:06.40
only have to win once so it doesn't matter if you if you lose 300 times doesn't matter you just need

1271
01:23:06.40 --> 01:23:10.72
one hit so now you got to prepare yourself because it's going to be brutal because you're sending

1272
01:23:10.72 --> 01:23:17.04
out all these you know resumes to jobs you're not quite qualified enough for because you're looking

1273
01:23:17.04 --> 01:23:22.88
to move up brace yourself right it's going to be nothing but failure nothing but failure well

1274
01:23:22.88 --> 01:23:29.04
this particular client to think it took her two years maybe more two and a half years of sending

1275
01:23:29.04 --> 01:23:34.48
out resumes and accelerating her education and and practicing because she'd get an interview now

1276
01:23:34.48 --> 01:23:40.48
and then and get very close to it to get that first move right but then she got two more in the

1277
01:23:40.48 --> 01:23:47.44
next year and she was out tripler salary but you know it's like long terms strategic thinking

1278
01:23:47.44 --> 01:23:53.20
followed by an implementable plan and then the willingness to tolerate an insane run of

1279
01:23:53.76 --> 01:24:01.52
ridiculous failures before you move but I've seen that happen to people there's no reason that you can't

1280
01:24:01.52 --> 01:24:06.32
move you just have to figure out where you want to move you have to figure out what the criteria are

1281
01:24:06.32 --> 01:24:12.08
for putting you in that position and then you have to be some measure of insanely persistent because

1282
01:24:12.08 --> 01:24:19.20
it's so unlikely right that the default answer to the question can I have this good job is

1283
01:24:19.20 --> 01:24:25.68
are you out of your mind of course not right well it is it's like an even if you're qualified it's

1284
01:24:25.68 --> 01:24:31.44
like yeah you and ten other people so there's even an element of chance at it especially at the end

1285
01:24:31.44 --> 01:24:38.72
you don't like if you're in the top five you've done everything you can can do to control that

1286
01:24:38.72 --> 01:24:44.16
outcome there's some element of chance that's going to be the determining variable because you know

1287
01:24:44.16 --> 01:24:49.52
maybe I don't know maybe they didn't like the way your suit looked on you and that's the only

1288
01:24:49.52 --> 01:24:53.04
thing that's differentiating you from the other candidate it's like you also don't want to take

1289
01:24:53.04 --> 01:24:57.52
that to personally it's like what you hit the top five you were shortlisted you're in there man

1290
01:24:57.52 --> 01:25:02.40
you're in there you're in the gap do that ten times you'll win one of those contests but you

1291
01:25:02.40 --> 01:25:09.04
got to do it ten times so and you know even if it's lower in jobs like I've worked in lots of

1292
01:25:09.04 --> 01:25:17.36
lower in jobs we talked about dishwasher yeah yeah yeah well you know I was dishwasher for

1293
01:25:17.36 --> 01:25:21.84
while but then I was a shorter to cook yeah and you know but more than that more importantly than that

1294
01:25:21.84 --> 01:25:28.000
even while I was a dishwasher washer once I kind of got the hang of it which was a lot harder

1295
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:35.84
than you might think once I got the hang of it I was valued member of that team it's like

1296
01:25:35.84 --> 01:25:39.04
while you're dishwasher it's like yeah that's one way of looking at it another way of looking

1297
01:25:39.04 --> 01:25:43.20
at it's that I'm valued member of this team and that was actually fun like I was just a kid you know

1298
01:25:43.20 --> 01:25:50.000
I was 14 and I was I did my job properly and I got treated like an adult it was like I loved that

1299
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.96
I loved that that was great and so the fact that I was well are you a dishwasher or you a

1300
01:25:54.96 --> 01:26:01.68
14 year old adult hey I'm a 14 year old adult hey I win I win that dishwasher no dishwasher

1301
01:26:01.68 --> 01:26:05.84
it's like that's a good game and I really did like that I mean when I look back in my

1302
01:26:05.84 --> 01:26:11.84
mid-adolescence it's certainly in the case that the the times that were the best for me when

1303
01:26:11.84 --> 01:26:18.16
I was working in restaurants because I was I was part of the team man so

1304
01:26:18.16 --> 01:26:25.04
you one of the sections in the book you talk about um I believe the person's name was lunchbox

1305
01:26:25.04 --> 01:26:29.52
lunch bucket lunch bucket right for a little bit you know since we're talking about

1306
01:26:30.48 --> 01:26:35.36
work environments and there's that certain level of camaraderie you actually talk about the

1307
01:26:35.36 --> 01:26:40.72
seal teams in here where you just have this it's like a non and I've talked about this before

1308
01:26:40.72 --> 01:26:49.12
in the seal teams it's non stop hyper verbal abuse aggression around the clock 24 hours

1309
01:26:49.12 --> 01:26:56.96
day you're in a seal pool tune like that's the life any any mistake that you make any any

1310
01:26:56.96 --> 01:27:04.16
display of weakness is gonna be especially contaminated we rip apart always gonna be ripped apart

1311
01:27:04.16 --> 01:27:08.72
and then if you get all your tated about that it's even worse then you're just dead the nicknames

1312
01:27:08.72 --> 01:27:13.36
you talked about lunch bucket your nickname was how do you how do you do the nicknames

1313
01:27:13.36 --> 01:27:17.52
or the how do you which was which was pretty good about it yeah I'm from how do you do

1314
01:27:17.52 --> 01:27:23.28
which is kind of so good how do you which is kind of cool right is western yeah but but

1315
01:27:23.28 --> 01:27:28.48
the nicknames that that are in the seal teams like I can't with good conscience repeat them

1316
01:27:28.48 --> 01:27:34.88
sure that they're just they're just horrible names but there's a camaraderie around that

1317
01:27:34.88 --> 01:27:39.12
and there's also the way as I was reading what you'd written about these guys working on rail

1318
01:27:39.12 --> 01:27:45.36
rate where are we crew yeah there's a test it's a test it's a test to see where you're at

1319
01:27:45.36 --> 01:27:49.68
it's right you made up can we rely on you can you can you can you can you tolerate a little bit of

1320
01:27:49.68 --> 01:27:53.52
irritation the answer that is no it's like well maybe we don't want you around then because

1321
01:27:53.52 --> 01:27:59.36
some irritating things are likely to come down the pipe yeah and it's it's not just um

1322
01:27:59.36 --> 01:28:04.48
to me to me it proves if you've got someone that can take it right it's not just that they can take

1323
01:28:04.48 --> 01:28:09.12
some random joking insults like they can they can take it they can take it yeah that's

1324
01:28:09.12 --> 01:28:13.28
what you're testing for it's like can you take it lunch pocket couldn't right because people

1325
01:28:13.28 --> 01:28:17.84
would laugh at his lunch pocket and he'd get all upset it's like well you have a stupid lunch

1326
01:28:17.84 --> 01:28:22.08
pocket it's like you know your mum packed it how about it you laugh at yourself yeah my mum packed

1327
01:28:22.08 --> 01:28:25.84
this I know it's kind of stupid that would be the end of it he would just have to say that

1328
01:28:25.84 --> 01:28:30.24
it's like but I didn't want to hurt her feelings it's like oh okay you know fine you got your

1329
01:28:30.24 --> 01:28:35.44
stupid lunch pocket but no he couldn't handle that you know so yeah it was it was horrible

1330
01:28:35.44 --> 01:28:39.44
had comical to watch at the same time because the level of and people have written me about that

1331
01:28:39.44 --> 01:28:43.44
and they said oh you know poor lunch pocket it's like because they're all compassion I think no

1332
01:28:43.44 --> 01:28:48.64
no not poor lunch pocket it's like clue the hell in buddy you had your chance you know that was a

1333
01:28:48.64 --> 01:28:53.52
desirable job that real crew job in the summer because it was high paying you know and they weren't

1334
01:28:53.52 --> 01:28:57.84
easy to come by those jobs and so the fact that he got hired onto that crew is a real opportunity

1335
01:28:57.84 --> 01:29:02.72
for him you could make a pile of money in the summer out working on the rail crew and all you had to do is

1336
01:29:04.48 --> 01:29:11.20
take some ribbing with good grace not suck up to the management too badly and not have other

1337
01:29:11.20 --> 01:29:16.24
people do your job that was all that was all you had to do but he couldn't do that and so he got

1338
01:29:16.24 --> 01:29:22.32
run off and it was like grow the hell up buddy you know these guys when 100 people are teasing you

1339
01:29:22.32 --> 01:29:32.40
then probably they're not wrong yeah when you are getting tease like that as well

1340
01:29:33.76 --> 01:29:40.000
well when you when you when you stop reacting it's no longer fun yeah yeah yeah well also gives you an

1341
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.64
opportunity to tease back it's like yeah you can show your wit and one of the things that working

1342
01:29:44.64 --> 01:29:48.96
class guys in particular which is what one of the things I really loved about working class jobs is that

1343
01:29:48.96 --> 01:29:53.84
they're always looking for some humor so it's like if if person A is teasing person B that's kind

1344
01:29:53.84 --> 01:30:00.08
of comical but if person B comes back with a good time back it's like not even better you know so

1345
01:30:00.08 --> 01:30:04.16
I think that's a lot of how those jobs are rendered tolerable right it's their their hard

1346
01:30:04.64 --> 01:30:10.72
dirty jobs dishwasher's a good example that's not dangerous although cooking is you know you

1347
01:30:10.72 --> 01:30:17.52
gotta watch your step I got burned a lot when I was cooking but what makes those jobs not only

1348
01:30:17.52 --> 01:30:22.56
tolerable but even desirable is that you can develop a tremendous amount of camaraderie around them

1349
01:30:22.56 --> 01:30:27.52
I've never really experienced that at a professional level job that just doesn't happen the same way

1350
01:30:27.52 --> 01:30:34.56
and it's really there's a real loss in that so it's it's it's it's fun to be part of a team that's doing

1351
01:30:34.96 --> 01:30:42.000
you know grubby hands on things and and having a ridiculously entertaining vicious

1352
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:48.000
cruel and evil time while you're doing it that's very entertaining the this new kids book I wrote so

1353
01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.28
uh the kid mark he's getting made fun of by this he's a different kind of bully he's like a mental

1354
01:30:53.28 --> 01:31:00.80
bully that that verbally abuses people and he gets called plate face by this character and to

1355
01:31:02.16 --> 01:31:05.92
it eventually gets in trouble for throwing a something at the kid because he's calling him plate face

1356
01:31:05.92 --> 01:31:11.52
plate but eventually way he befriends the kid is by he they have to do a self portrait class he draws a picture of

1357
01:31:11.52 --> 01:31:16.000
himself looking like a plate and he shows the kid the kid laughs and all of a sudden their buddies and it's like

1358
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:24.72
that's what you do you take away that you take away the joy of of being so heated and irritated by

1359
01:31:24.72 --> 01:31:28.56
people that are making fun of you and you just kill it right there too jutsu and some sense well

1360
01:31:28.56 --> 01:31:34.96
I had an experience with that about three years ago I'd put my videos up online and people kept saying

1361
01:31:34.96 --> 01:31:40.56
that I sounded like kermit well one person said it and I thought well whatever but then like five

1362
01:31:40.56 --> 01:31:45.04
people said it and I thought oh my god like this kermit thing so then I went and listened to kermit

1363
01:31:45.04 --> 01:31:51.68
and I thought oh no it's like it's like really I really sound like kermit you know and so then

1364
01:31:51.68 --> 01:31:56.48
well then I started to play with it a little bit you know I used the puppet when I when I

1365
01:31:56.48 --> 01:32:01.12
when I went to speak to university students and I made frog jokes and then I made a video

1366
01:32:01.12 --> 01:32:07.60
that sort of featured me as a frog and it's crazy right it's ridiculous but but that's and but

1367
01:32:07.60 --> 01:32:12.72
but the teasing never got mean because of that you know and the same things happened online

1368
01:32:12.72 --> 01:32:17.52
to a larger degree as people keep making memes of me like and there's I don't know there's lots of them

1369
01:32:17.52 --> 01:32:22.72
there's way too many to even keep track of and I was watching that happen and I thought okay this is a

1370
01:32:22.72 --> 01:32:26.40
good thing because there's humor and wherever there's humor that's a good thing and they're making

1371
01:32:26.40 --> 01:32:31.28
fun of me but it's gentle you know most of it was poki you know like well you sound like this

1372
01:32:31.28 --> 01:32:35.04
damn puppet what do you think about it's like well if I had to pick someone to sound like

1373
01:32:35.04 --> 01:32:39.36
probably wouldn't be a puppet but it had to be a puppet kermit's not a bad one it could be a lot

1374
01:32:39.36 --> 01:32:44.80
worse it could be mispaggy yeah it could be not you know so thank god that didn't happen but the

1375
01:32:44.80 --> 01:32:51.36
memes have never got vicious because you know I'll post them if they're funny and satirical and

1376
01:32:51.36 --> 01:32:55.68
then they won't get vicious because they don't have to it's like can we poke fun of at you it's like

1377
01:32:55.68 --> 01:33:00.48
yeah please do and the more the better really because that'll also help keep my feet on the ground

1378
01:33:00.48 --> 01:33:04.96
and keep me awake and plus it's funny and like one of the things about life is that

1379
01:33:05.76 --> 01:33:11.52
a sense of humor that's a good thing to to arm yourself with because sometimes you just don't have

1380
01:33:11.52 --> 01:33:17.68
anything other than that like my daughter when she recounts her the horrors of her adolescent she

1381
01:33:17.68 --> 01:33:22.72
she had to have her hip and her ankle replaced because they both deteriorated beyond repair

1382
01:33:22.72 --> 01:33:28.24
beyond the possibility of repair and she was like an agony for literally for years it was just awful

1383
01:33:28.24 --> 01:33:34.08
she can tell that story in a way that will just make you die of laughter and it's like well thank

1384
01:33:34.08 --> 01:33:39.04
God for that because what else do you have in a situation like that man if you if and sometimes it's

1385
01:33:39.04 --> 01:33:44.56
so dark that your sense of humor is just about gone and then you're in real trouble but lots of times

1386
01:33:44.56 --> 01:33:48.72
that's what you've got against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune it's like

1387
01:33:48.72 --> 01:33:53.04
you see this with people especially people who've been through really hard times and they're

1388
01:33:53.04 --> 01:33:58.72
witty like things will be bleak bleak bleak and they'll crack a joke and you think well thank God man

1389
01:33:58.72 --> 01:34:05.28
you can pop up above that and see above it a bit and and like you know tap it with a bit of irony

1390
01:34:05.28 --> 01:34:09.92
and thank God for that so when the comedians start to get silence there's real trouble and

1391
01:34:09.92 --> 01:34:14.56
that's been happening to some degree in Canada you know comedians are increasingly not willing to go

1392
01:34:14.56 --> 01:34:20.72
speak on university campuses and that's when the comedians can't talk that's a really bad

1393
01:34:20.72 --> 01:34:26.96
sight because that's the that comedy that's the triumph of the human spirit over adversity right

1394
01:34:26.96 --> 01:34:32.40
that's why guys in these horrible jobs are often so unbelievably funny it's like well what else do

1395
01:34:32.40 --> 01:34:38.56
they have you know and and actually that's a lot to be funny like that to that can that can

1396
01:34:38.56 --> 01:34:44.24
move you through a lot of dismal so you know I I'm paying attention to time because I know in

1397
01:34:44.24 --> 01:34:49.44
case someone can't tell that we're by an airport right now but to kind of bring this a little bit

1398
01:34:49.44 --> 01:34:52.72
too close first of all we didn't cover anything that I wanted to cover today so we should all

1399
01:34:52.72 --> 01:34:57.68
know that so you're coming back to do that with my talks like oh that's not the talk I plan

1400
01:34:57.68 --> 01:35:02.48
well yeah your first biblical talk you covered the first line of Genesis right you made it one line

1401
01:35:02.48 --> 01:35:08.64
deep and done half hours well done well done yeah but one of the things and I think it's a good

1402
01:35:08.64 --> 01:35:13.12
note to end on at least a little bit to touch on because you're kind of talking about it right now

1403
01:35:13.12 --> 01:35:17.76
is you know the last rule is to to pet a cat when you encounter one on the street yeah

1404
01:35:18.64 --> 01:35:25.28
it's basically find a little bit of joy in these common things well it's a it's a chapter

1405
01:35:25.28 --> 01:35:31.04
about about my daughter's experience and like it was a brutal man it was brutal she was literally

1406
01:35:31.04 --> 01:35:36.72
walking around on two broken legs for two years and she had to take incredibly high doses of

1407
01:35:36.72 --> 01:35:41.12
opiates and so had all the problems that went along with that she had to take riddle into stay awake

1408
01:35:41.12 --> 01:35:46.56
it's like and she was in all likelihood she was dying there's a bunch of reasons for that and

1409
01:35:46.56 --> 01:35:51.04
and those were just some of her health problems those were those weren't even the worst ones

1410
01:35:51.04 --> 01:35:57.76
strangely enough so it was bloody brutal man and one of the things we told her and we managed this

1411
01:35:57.76 --> 01:36:02.56
thank god as I told her once the disease started to develop she had rheumatoid arthritis very

1412
01:36:02.56 --> 01:36:08.08
very seriously I said to her when she was a little kid said look kid this is gonna be rough man

1413
01:36:08.08 --> 01:36:13.28
this is gonna be rough and and here's what you could do to make it worse it's like use your illness

1414
01:36:13.28 --> 01:36:18.72
as an excuse you do that at your peril you do that a hundred times you will not be able to tell

1415
01:36:18.72 --> 01:36:23.92
the difference between suffering that stops you from moving forward and an excuse for not

1416
01:36:23.92 --> 01:36:30.88
living and you will be done it's never never never use your illness as an excuse like if you can't

1417
01:36:30.88 --> 01:36:37.04
do it you can't do it you know we had a good experience without it's written in the book when

1418
01:36:37.92 --> 01:36:42.40
we bought her a scooter because she couldn't use public transportation and we were all freaked out

1419
01:36:42.40 --> 01:36:46.96
about that because like well she has damaged bones and you know broken hip and all of this is like

1420
01:36:46.96 --> 01:36:52.96
you're gonna buy that kid a scooter really it's like well what are you gonna do keep her in her bedroom

1421
01:36:52.96 --> 01:36:57.52
you want to think that's a good idea tell her she can't go out in the world it's like have the

1422
01:36:57.52 --> 01:37:02.64
damn scooter so after awhile she had to get licensed for it there's a licensing procedure and

1423
01:37:02.64 --> 01:37:06.96
to do that she actually had to write a motorbike and so she trained to write the motorbike

1424
01:37:06.96 --> 01:37:11.76
like not very long after she had her hip replaced I think it was a six week something like

1425
01:37:11.76 --> 01:37:15.44
that so of course we're all freaked out about that too because it's like oh man she has to

1426
01:37:15.44 --> 01:37:20.32
write a motorbike and she has this hip and it's like what are we gonna do and she went and she

1427
01:37:20.32 --> 01:37:25.84
did the motorcycle last first one but she dropped the bike a couple of times and some kid wiped out

1428
01:37:25.84 --> 01:37:31.20
and rolled like 30 feet and that kind of freaked her out unsurprisingly and and so then the second

1429
01:37:31.20 --> 01:37:35.04
day she went with her mom to do the motorcycle training she also got trained to write a motor

1430
01:37:35.04 --> 01:37:41.84
motorcycle and the second day she woke up and she said I don't think I can do this and we thought

1431
01:37:41.84 --> 01:37:47.36
well you know that's understandable it's like I can understand that and we talked through it we

1432
01:37:47.36 --> 01:37:52.40
said look here's what to do man is like yeah you can't do it we understand why you're afraid of it

1433
01:37:52.40 --> 01:37:59.84
you can't hold the bike up that well but why don't you just go like go in the car with your mom

1434
01:38:00.40 --> 01:38:04.80
and see how you feel when you get there because you get close and you get right up to it

1435
01:38:05.52 --> 01:38:10.40
maybe you can say no and you have to sit in the car and like that's life and we get it but

1436
01:38:10.40 --> 01:38:14.80
maybe you don't have to and she went there so she thought that was okay and she went there

1437
01:38:14.80 --> 01:38:19.12
and she picked up the damn motorbike and got her license and everybody cheered at the end and

1438
01:38:19.12 --> 01:38:24.08
then she could drive her goddamn scooter around and thank God for that because you know she used

1439
01:38:24.08 --> 01:38:28.80
to go out there and she put on her helmet and she'd go on her scooter and she was like ready to go

1440
01:38:28.80 --> 01:38:34.08
out the world and so that's like that's the difference between making your kids safe and making them

1441
01:38:34.08 --> 01:38:38.48
strong and it was touching bloody go you know because it could have easily been that she would have

1442
01:38:38.48 --> 01:38:41.68
been in the little accident with her motorcycle and broken her leg and then we would have

1443
01:38:41.68 --> 01:38:45.52
thought oh what kind of horrible parents are we she's already got problems and we put her on a

1444
01:38:45.52 --> 01:38:51.12
damn scooter in the middle of the city it's like well you're going to be competent or you're

1445
01:38:51.12 --> 01:38:57.20
going to be safe it's like there's nothing safer than competence and so and it was great for

1446
01:38:57.20 --> 01:39:02.32
because it was just one more active courage you know and and she loved that damn scooter she had it

1447
01:39:02.32 --> 01:39:09.36
for like six years and it was a really good idea risky as hell but really a good idea so yep

1448
01:39:09.36 --> 01:39:17.76
well yeah again I'm looking at the clock we got to get you out of here first of all 12 rules for

1449
01:39:17.76 --> 01:39:27.44
life and and it don't to chaos that's out right now it's number one on Amazon in America UK Canada

1450
01:39:28.48 --> 01:39:36.72
everywhere that's pretty awesome I'm I'm yeah struck wordless by it yeah yeah

1451
01:39:36.72 --> 01:39:42.80
everyone should just get it and because we didn't talk about anything I wanted to talk about today

1452
01:39:44.56 --> 01:39:49.04
you come back we'll do this book and everyone likes to read the books if I keep they can before

1453
01:39:49.04 --> 01:39:52.000
I do the podcast on them so to give everyone a chance to read it which would be awesome

1454
01:39:53.12 --> 01:39:58.80
any other things well I should say I've got this online program called self-authoring

1455
01:39:59.36 --> 01:40:05.92
and I'm offering your viewers a enlistner's a 20% discount that helps you write out an autobiography

1456
01:40:05.92 --> 01:40:10.96
so you can figure out like what you haven't sorted out about your life it helps you write an

1457
01:40:10.96 --> 01:40:15.52
analysis of your virtues in fault so you can rectify the faults and capitalize on the virtues

1458
01:40:15.52 --> 01:40:21.12
and helps you make a plan for the future and I would say to your listeners don't be afraid to

1459
01:40:21.12 --> 01:40:28.40
do it badly because a bad plan a bad account for yourself and a bad plan is way better than

1460
01:40:28.40 --> 01:40:34.96
no account for yourself and no plan it's way better so do it do it badly it'll it'll help

1461
01:40:34.96 --> 01:40:43.52
orient you in your life and we have a preponderance of of scientific data showing for example

1462
01:40:43.52 --> 01:40:48.80
that people who've done the future authoring portion of this that's the plan are like 30% more

1463
01:40:48.80 --> 01:40:53.84
likely to stay in university has an overwhelming effect and it works best on people who are doing

1464
01:40:53.84 --> 01:41:00.16
worst which is really quite cool so there's that I have a personality test at understand myself

1465
01:41:00.16 --> 01:41:06.08
calm and you can go there and get an analysis of 10 aspects of your personality it's kind of a harsh

1466
01:41:06.08 --> 01:41:11.52
test like it'll tell you actually what you're like and it'll probably make you angry you know

1467
01:41:11.52 --> 01:41:17.52
because maybe not but it probably will but it'll tell you it'll help you figure out what jobs you

1468
01:41:17.52 --> 01:41:22.80
might be suited for but it'll also tell you where your week and could be stronger and so that's

1469
01:41:22.80 --> 01:41:28.72
better medicine but but it's better to know it's better to know because then you can do something

1470
01:41:28.72 --> 01:41:36.80
about it so I would say those are two useful things and I'd encourage people to they're inexpensive

1471
01:41:36.80 --> 01:41:43.28
give them a try they'll they're helpful and on top of that you've got your podcast you've got your

01:41:43.28 --> 01:41:52.64
YouTube channel which has hundreds of hours worth of lectures and is fantastic Jordan Petersen

1479
01:42:33.68 --> 01:42:41.20
good if we could manage that yeah indeed all right thanks for coming on you bet well we have excused

1480
01:42:41.20 --> 01:42:48.48
Dr Jordan Peterson from the this is a recording studio no we're in a rented office make shift

1481
01:42:48.48 --> 01:42:56.80
make shift Jordan had to go catch a plane and continue to get out there and make the world a

1482
01:42:56.80 --> 01:43:02.88
better place good for him yes good for us and echo speaking of making the world a better place sure

1483
01:43:02.88 --> 01:43:11.68
maybe you can let us know how we might be able to make our world a little bit better sure of course

1484
01:43:12.56 --> 01:43:21.60
yeah first thing we can do is stay on the path oh and part of staying on the path is maintaining

1485
01:43:21.60 --> 01:43:31.44
our physical capability and competent competency competency is it competence or competency competency

1486
01:43:31.44 --> 01:43:38.96
we're gonna maintain that that's what we're gonna do on the path so we had jocquests of

1487
01:43:38.96 --> 01:43:45.60
limits obviously we already know if you don't know krill oil joint warfare so jocquest super krill oil

1488
01:43:45.60 --> 01:43:50.64
that's a krill oil supplement so joint where warfare is the glucosamine conjurting and

1489
01:43:51.76 --> 01:43:58.32
curcumin yes very good things for your joints we you know at some point we'll go through

1490
01:43:58.32 --> 01:44:04.48
everything that's in there not today yeah I do something so that because I don't want to

1491
01:44:04.48 --> 01:44:12.80
turn talk about but it's good yeah it's good use it yeah you see the and it's not the kind where

1492
01:44:12.80 --> 01:44:19.04
it's good because it's generally healthy to take these things which it is but that's not the the main

1493
01:44:19.04 --> 01:44:28.72
push in my opinion check the main thing is that if your joints are kind of kind of off jacks or

1494
01:44:29.44 --> 01:44:38.88
do you do you do a lot do anything but if you if you do brick laying what does that Mason

1495
01:44:38.88 --> 01:44:46.72
Mason if you're yeah like just from you know back elbows and then you start taking this you'll see

1496
01:44:46.72 --> 01:44:52.96
that you'll feel that different you know specifically yeah and it's generally healthy anyway

1497
01:44:52.96 --> 01:45:00.32
maintain the joints maintain the competency of your joints with jockel super krill joint warfare

1498
01:45:00.32 --> 01:45:06.40
take them every day that's what I do in the routine also discipline pre workout it's a pre workout for

1499
01:45:06.40 --> 01:45:11.60
me it's it's a pre mission for me it's a pre mission free trade up pre motion cognitive

1500
01:45:11.60 --> 01:45:17.68
yeah and answer yeah and I'll tell you the only downfall of it right now well there's a couple

1501
01:45:17.68 --> 01:45:22.88
number one it tastes delicious so you want to drink a lot of it number two the other day I drink

1502
01:45:22.88 --> 01:45:29.44
oh a lot of it I'm gonna have to go and give a speech yeah I had to use the restroom right before

1503
01:45:29.44 --> 01:45:33.92
I went on stage of general like yeah it's be careful well that's a general thing I know I like

1504
01:45:33.92 --> 01:45:38.64
it doesn't have to be jockel discipline yeah you can do that with water careful yeah yeah you

1505
01:45:38.64 --> 01:45:42.56
want to be careful but think you eat some of it like oh can we eat that eight some of it today it's

1506
01:45:43.52 --> 01:45:48.80
see I'll try to avoid that yeah yeah yeah see so I like to took a mouth a little scoop yeah

1507
01:45:48.80 --> 01:45:55.92
and it's not too bad in fact you know what you know you get like a shot of some really nasty alcohol

1508
01:45:56.80 --> 01:46:02.24
keep it sure but it gives you like a little yeah sure guys you look at some of that yeah

1509
01:46:02.24 --> 01:46:06.32
when you take just when you eat the straight powder sure which I'm now doing apparently

1510
01:46:06.32 --> 01:46:11.36
it's gives you a little bit it gives you a little not only you get the effects of what's

1511
01:46:11.36 --> 01:46:16.40
it but you get a little bit of a the main line yeah yeah that's kind of like when you're

1512
01:46:16.40 --> 01:46:20.16
kid you buy the little cool lady you know when you be for you make the cool lady you get like a

1513
01:46:20.16 --> 01:46:26.32
little you try that stuff straight yeah yeah it's like only it's not quite as horrible is that

1514
01:46:27.04 --> 01:46:30.48
better than that it's better than cool lady no oh yeah definitely better than cool

1515
01:46:30.48 --> 01:46:34.48
good jockel made a taste good he's into the taste good stuff anyway it's called

1516
01:46:34.48 --> 01:46:40.72
did joc this it's called discipline called this yeah you'll see it anyway get at origin main

1517
01:46:40.72 --> 01:46:46.88
dot com and also at origin main dot com you get you that's where you can get your ghee

1518
01:46:48.16 --> 01:46:53.28
so you don't have to well you can still ask me what ghee get no don't ask anymore not

1519
01:46:53.28 --> 01:46:57.04
not ask good I'll tell you I'll tell you and this is what I'll tell you good origin pick a

1520
01:46:57.04 --> 01:47:01.04
ghee from there whichever when you want plenty of color not plenty of colors but the legit color

1521
01:47:01.04 --> 01:47:09.44
you I have white I have one blue ghee that I never use all I have is white I have a black

1522
01:47:09.44 --> 01:47:12.88
ghee someone gave me a black ghee and this is cool but I've never used it but

1523
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.80
because a lot of people ask me that too what color should I get yeah what color should you get

1524
01:47:18.80 --> 01:47:24.32
I am very traditional and I use the white ghee but I do have a deaf ghee that's black

1525
01:47:24.32 --> 01:47:28.40
black yes he's super dope but some schools they don't even allow other colors than white

1526
01:47:28.40 --> 01:47:36.000
and blue yeah that's true but Pete says black is the is the number one seller okay like if

1527
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:43.28
just all colors black now can you compete iBJJF with a black ghee I don't know I forget but

1528
01:47:43.28 --> 01:47:48.80
here's what we were talking about when you're a little kid and you think about martial arts what

1529
01:47:48.80 --> 01:47:55.60
do you want to be the ninja you want to be an ninja yeah so now you got a 36 year old guy or a 28 year

1530
01:47:55.60 --> 01:48:02.08
old guy and he finally he's feeling kind of ninja yes yeah what is he doing the legit too yeah

1531
01:48:02.08 --> 01:48:07.12
then he's take that one extra step and he's got a black ghee boom ninja yeah in a matter of

1532
01:48:07.12 --> 01:48:12.32
speaking yeah and I actually felt that that's part of the reason why I don't get a black ghee because

1533
01:48:12.32 --> 01:48:17.84
I I kind of wanted like not like there's all Charles Bronson movie feathers what do you mean

1534
01:48:17.84 --> 01:48:23.60
on old Charles Bronson movie called the mechanic yeah yeah there's a there's a there's a scene

1535
01:48:23.60 --> 01:48:29.60
where their traditional karate guy is gonna fight a guy that's got some new tricks up his sleeve

1536
01:48:29.60 --> 01:48:36.24
sure and the traditional karate guy has to get nuts on him yeah but these are just a plain white

1537
01:48:36.24 --> 01:48:41.68
ghee yeah yeah yeah that's the tradition and Charles Bronson too yeah so I'm just you know

1538
01:48:41.68 --> 01:48:47.76
yeah and in the line strangely I mainly stick to white because it's kind of that's the main like

1539
01:48:47.76 --> 01:48:53.28
I'm not doing too much with the with the cool black one because the black one like I

1540
01:48:53.28 --> 01:48:58.96
said about being ninja and it looks cool bright does it's really cool and but I didn't want to

1541
01:48:58.96 --> 01:49:03.60
roll in and be like and they think oh what if you carry the girl cool with your black ghee kind of

1542
01:49:03.60 --> 01:49:09.12
think you know the thing is I think it's progressed beyond that it's totally honest it's beyond that

1543
01:49:09.12 --> 01:49:16.08
yeah you're not you're not standing out at all you have a black ghee now you might be if you go to

1544
01:49:16.08 --> 01:49:20.88
a traditional you know school that has only white ghee yeah you're gonna stand out you come in

1545
01:49:20.88 --> 01:49:23.68
and victory MMA in fitness you could be wearing a purple ghee no one's gonna care yeah I

1546
01:49:23.68 --> 01:49:26.96
won't even look into your second camouflage yeah no one cares they might be like dang that's a

1547
01:49:26.96 --> 01:49:32.96
cool camouflage ghee they might say that they might just put choke hold on you and get after it yeah

1548
01:49:33.36 --> 01:49:40.24
so there it is I would say okay if they're saying hey jocco echo what ghee should I get what

1549
01:49:40.24 --> 01:49:45.60
color should I get we know origin what color should I get a ask your school first yeah because

1550
01:49:45.60 --> 01:49:51.44
some they don't allow you're gonna buy your cool black ghee or there's like army greener is there army greener

1551
01:49:52.16 --> 01:49:55.76
you're gonna buy and they looked up and you're solid you're ready to go and you come in they

1552
01:49:55.76 --> 01:50:00.24
see you can't train with that you can't have that some ask your school first if they allow all colors

1553
01:50:01.20 --> 01:50:08.16
then that ones up to you yeah yeah but but the the point is with asking what color is that I think I

1554
01:50:08.16 --> 01:50:13.92
think that they're like hey is there like a violation if I get this cool black one and you answer

1555
01:50:13.92 --> 01:50:19.60
to it yeah now no unless your school does literally no factor literally no factor yeah

1556
01:50:20.40 --> 01:50:27.20
so they got a you know an origin mean dot com that's where you get them also on it dot com slash jocco

1557
01:50:27.20 --> 01:50:35.44
this is where I get the kettlebells the dope kettlebells you didn't talk about rash rash guards

1558
01:50:35.44 --> 01:50:41.76
oh and origin yeah yeah and because the reason that I popped into my mind because they have spats now

1559
01:50:41.76 --> 01:50:49.04
because they have spats now the first runa spats are green and like some other color yeah yellow

1560
01:50:49.04 --> 01:50:56.24
line green yeah right you just didn't you don't worry I sent p to text now I'm not a got spats

1561
01:50:56.24 --> 01:51:00.96
wearing dude I'm not wearing tights not happening just nothing against people that do there's some

1562
01:51:00.96 --> 01:51:07.92
crazy due to two guys out there that are wearing tights like you read about yeah but I said I said

1563
01:51:07.92 --> 01:51:14.32
AP not wearing tights yeah I know a lot of people that do make some black ones or something else

1564
01:51:14.32 --> 01:51:21.04
yeah and he said got it yeah you can get obviously the rash guards are good to go yeah but now you

1565
01:51:21.04 --> 01:51:27.52
can also get spats that are not so we're sticking with spats we're seeing what spats when we

1566
01:51:27.52 --> 01:51:32.16
figured out the root of spats right or dope yeah it's a good thing yeah it's not it's I thought it

1567
01:51:32.16 --> 01:51:39.12
would root back to you know some yeah some ballerina thing no it's a war yeah it's what you

1568
01:51:39.12 --> 01:51:44.16
worn your legs when you're a cow for women yeah so we can say spats it's been approved yeah

1569
01:51:44.16 --> 01:51:48.80
full of stuff yeah it's the same thing yeah it's you you take your shoe and your so we're good

1570
01:51:48.80 --> 01:51:53.60
ankle yeah fully interesting color choice yeah the first one here's the thing though

1571
01:51:53.60 --> 01:52:01.84
yeah about the spats yeah some colors you don't see like like if I was like hey I'm

1572
01:52:01.84 --> 01:52:06.64
gonna wear this lime green and yellow thing whatever shirt spats whatever and you'd be like

1573
01:52:06.64 --> 01:52:10.80
lime green yellow that just doesn't even sound good I'm looking at these two colors I don't think

1574
01:52:10.80 --> 01:52:14.40
that's gonna look good but then you put it on a shirt or spats or something and then you put it on

1575
01:52:14.40 --> 01:52:18.64
you're like oh dang that kind of works for some reason I'm not saying lime green and yellow does that

1576
01:52:18.64 --> 01:52:23.68
I'm just saying certain color yeah combination here's the interesting thing peats my bro right

1577
01:52:23.68 --> 01:52:31.68
sure me yeah literally with the first time I had a Skype conversation with Pete my wife is like

1578
01:52:31.68 --> 01:52:35.68
it sounded like you were talking to yourself right because we and we know there's a four hour conversation

1579
01:52:35.68 --> 01:52:42.000
by the way dang real now with that that being said I wouldn't have made spats that look like

1580
01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.24
the first spats to be it come out with a million years now here's now here's the funny thing

1581
01:52:46.24 --> 01:52:52.08
okay I can't even say I can't even say hey Pete don't you know no one's gonna like those you

1582
01:52:52.08 --> 01:52:59.36
know why because my sense of fashion yeah is so off my sense of fashion is not exist yeah with

1583
01:52:59.36 --> 01:53:04.24
it's literally not exist it would be not exist if you even had one yeah okay that's right well

1584
01:53:04.24 --> 01:53:10.16
no it's not exist if you had one it would get it it's like double none okay yeah well so

1585
01:53:10.16 --> 01:53:15.12
that's why I can't even say hey Pete I can't say I can't make a blanket saving like Pete

1586
01:53:15.12 --> 01:53:21.84
people won't like those yeah I can't even say that because I have no idea so I just said what I do

1587
01:53:21.84 --> 01:53:28.64
know is people would definitely like some black ones right yeah that's pretty safe to say so yeah

1588
01:53:28.64 --> 01:53:34.000
yeah I don't mind the greener by the way but there you go no you even we've had this stuff we've

1589
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:38.40
had issues like this yes where you make things that I just don't yeah I'm not I'm the other

1590
01:53:38.40 --> 01:53:42.72
on approved yeah on approved cross the board yeah but I just know you just kind of just don't know

1591
01:53:42.72 --> 01:53:48.16
yeah I say okay you know I don't know that's I gotta stay humble over here yeah I can't claim to

1592
01:53:48.88 --> 01:53:56.16
claim to have any any footing to stand on at all when it comes to fashion but that's any kind

1593
01:53:56.16 --> 01:54:01.92
yeah and haircuts I'm pretty good with those you know what yeah sure if you had okay next question

1677
02:02:48.64 --> 02:02:54.16

02:03:17.84 --> 02:03:24.56
on your campaign on the campaign against weakness that's what it is so if you're about to skip

1683
02:03:24.56 --> 02:03:31.20
your workout because you don't feel like it be you don't think you have time or something like this

1684
02:03:31.20 --> 02:03:36.16
or usually it's because you don't feel like it because you worked out yesterday your kind of

1685
02:03:36.16 --> 02:03:43.76
sore like you were gonna do squats today but you did a bunch of parapise yesterday so you're
