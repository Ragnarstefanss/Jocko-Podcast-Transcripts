00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.84
This is Jocco podcast number 20 with echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.

2
00:00:09.84 --> 00:00:17.000
Around 8pm on September 21st, 2007 the authorities notified me that I should go for a

3
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.52
mind reeducation talk.

4
00:00:20.52 --> 00:00:24.36
I found there were some unusual things happening at this time.

5
00:00:24.36 --> 00:00:29.76
The secret police who used to follow me very closely kept the further distance.

6
00:00:29.76 --> 00:00:35.20
I was walking down the street one day and then when I turned a corner about six or seven

7
00:00:35.20 --> 00:00:38.16
strangers started walking towards me.

8
00:00:38.16 --> 00:00:42.52
I suddenly felt a strong blow to the back of my neck and fell face down on the ground.

9
00:00:42.52 --> 00:00:48.12
Someone yanked my hair and a black hood was pulled over my head immediately.

10
00:00:48.12 --> 00:00:51.32
I was brought to a vehicle and was put in it.

11
00:00:51.32 --> 00:00:57.60
I couldn't see but it seemed that I had two benches with a space in the middle.

12
00:00:57.60 --> 00:01:00.12
I was putting the space in the middle of the floor.

13
00:01:00.12 --> 00:01:02.88
My right cheek was on the ground.

14
00:01:02.88 --> 00:01:06.60
All of a sudden a boot was put on my face holding me down.

15
00:01:06.60 --> 00:01:08.76
Many hands started searching all over me.

16
00:01:08.76 --> 00:01:13.44
My belt was pulled off and used to tie my hands behind my back.

17
00:01:13.44 --> 00:01:18.000
At least four people put their feet on me holding me down.

18
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.68
About 40 minutes later I was dragged out of the car.

19
00:01:21.68 --> 00:01:26.76
My pants were falling down around my knees and I was dragged into a room.

20
00:01:26.76 --> 00:01:31.48
No one said anything at all to me until that time.

21
00:01:31.48 --> 00:01:35.28
The hood was pulled off my head at this time.

22
00:01:35.28 --> 00:01:39.60
Immediately men began cursing and hitting me.

23
00:01:39.60 --> 00:01:44.20
One of the men said, your date of death has come today.

24
00:01:44.20 --> 00:01:47.64
Brothers let's give him a brutal lesson today.

25
00:01:47.64 --> 00:01:51.80
Beat him to death.

26
00:01:51.80 --> 00:01:58.48
Then four men with electric shock prods began beating my head and all over my body.

27
00:01:58.48 --> 00:02:03.96
Nothing but noise and the beating of my anxious breathing could be heard.

28
00:02:03.96 --> 00:02:09.60
I was beaten so severely that my whole body began uncontrollably shaking.

29
00:02:09.60 --> 00:02:11.20
Don't pretend to do that.

30
00:02:11.20 --> 00:02:17.48
I was shattered out by a guy who my later learned was named Wang.

31
00:02:17.48 --> 00:02:21.96
Then a very strong and tall man grabbed my hair and pulled me up off the ground.

32
00:02:21.96 --> 00:02:25.88
Then Wang began beating me on the face terribly.

33
00:02:25.88 --> 00:02:27.92
You are not worthy to wear clothes.

34
00:02:27.92 --> 00:02:30.24
Pull off all of his clothes.

35
00:02:30.24 --> 00:02:34.64
All of my clothes were pulled off and I was totally naked.

36
00:02:34.64 --> 00:02:39.72
Wang yelled again and someone kicked me in the back of my legs and I collapsed to the floor.

37
00:02:39.72 --> 00:02:45.08
The big guy continued to pull my hair and forced me to lift my head to see Wang.

38
00:02:45.08 --> 00:02:48.80
At this time I could see that there were five people in the room.

39
00:02:48.80 --> 00:02:54.24
Four of the men were holding electric prods and one was holding my belt.

40
00:02:54.24 --> 00:02:55.88
You listen gal.

41
00:02:55.88 --> 00:03:02.36
Today your uncle's want nothing but to make your life worse than death.

42
00:03:02.36 --> 00:03:06.20
While Wang was saying this the electric shock prods were put on my face and upper body

43
00:03:06.20 --> 00:03:08.84
shocking me.

44
00:03:08.84 --> 00:03:13.80
Wang then said, come on guys, deliver the second course.

45
00:03:13.80 --> 00:03:19.28
Then the electric shock betan was put all over me and my full body, my heart, lungs

46
00:03:19.28 --> 00:03:24.04
and muscles began jumping under my skin uncontrollably.

47
00:03:24.04 --> 00:03:29.24
I was writhing around on the ground and pain trying to crawl away.

48
00:03:29.24 --> 00:03:32.52
Wang then shocked me in my genitals.

49
00:03:32.52 --> 00:03:38.32
My begging them to stop only returned laughing and more unbelievable torture.

50
00:03:38.32 --> 00:03:43.48
Wang then used the electric shock betan three more times on my genitals while shouting loudly.

51
00:03:43.48 --> 00:03:52.08
After a few hours of this I had no energy to even beg, let alone try to escape.

52
00:03:52.08 --> 00:03:55.48
But my mind was still clear.

53
00:03:55.48 --> 00:03:59.40
It seems that the tortures themselves were also tired.

54
00:03:59.40 --> 00:04:03.04
Before the dawn came, three of them left the room.

55
00:04:03.04 --> 00:04:08.32
We will come back later to give them the next course Wang said.

56
00:04:08.32 --> 00:04:16.000
I asked how can you face the beating of Chinese and use mafia tactics on Chinese taxpayers?

57
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.64
You are an object to be beaten.

58
00:04:18.64 --> 00:04:21.44
You know that in your heart better than most.

59
00:04:21.44 --> 00:04:23.60
Taxpayers count for nothing in China.

60
00:04:23.60 --> 00:04:26.84
Don't talk about this term taxpayers.

61
00:04:26.84 --> 00:04:31.04
While he was saying this someone else also entered the room.

62
00:04:31.04 --> 00:04:33.52
I recognize the voice to be wang's.

63
00:04:33.52 --> 00:04:35.64
Don't talk to him with your mouth.

64
00:04:35.64 --> 00:04:40.04
Even the real thing, your uncles have prepared 12 courses.

65
00:04:40.04 --> 00:04:42.96
We only finished three last night.

66
00:04:42.96 --> 00:04:48.16
Your chief uncle doesn't like to talk and so following you will see that you will have

67
00:04:48.16 --> 00:04:52.28
to eat your own shit and drink your own piss.

68
00:04:52.28 --> 00:04:57.72
Don't you talk about torture by the Communist Party yet because we will give you a comprehensive

69
00:04:57.72 --> 00:04:59.96
lesson now.

70
00:04:59.96 --> 00:05:02.80
I am not afraid of you if you continue to write.

71
00:05:02.80 --> 00:05:09.44
We can torture you to death without your body being found.

72
00:05:09.44 --> 00:05:13.88
In the following hours of torture I passed out several times because of lack of water and

73
00:05:13.88 --> 00:05:15.84
food and heavy sweating.

74
00:05:15.84 --> 00:05:20.48
I was lying down on the cold floor naked.

75
00:05:20.48 --> 00:05:25.76
I felt several times someone would come and open my eyes and shine a flashlight into them

76
00:05:25.76 --> 00:05:28.24
to see if I was still alive.

77
00:05:28.24 --> 00:05:33.04
When I would come to I smelled the strong odor of stinky urine.

78
00:05:33.04 --> 00:05:37.48
My face knows and hair were filled with the smell.

79
00:05:37.48 --> 00:05:42.96
Obviously but I don't know when someone urinated on my face and head.

80
00:05:42.96 --> 00:05:47.12
This torture continued until around noon of the third day.

81
00:05:47.12 --> 00:05:52.16
I don't know where I got the strength to endure but somehow I struggled to get away from

82
00:05:52.16 --> 00:05:55.84
their grasp and began to beat my head on the table.

83
00:05:55.84 --> 00:06:04.24
I was shouting the names of my two children and trying to kill myself.

84
00:06:04.24 --> 00:06:07.000
But my attempt did not succeed.

85
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.80
I thank Almighty God for this.

86
00:06:09.80 --> 00:06:12.32
It was him who rescued me.

87
00:06:12.32 --> 00:06:17.92
I truly felt God dragged me back from that state and gave me my life.

88
00:06:17.92 --> 00:06:24.44
My eyes were full of bleeding through, though because of my head banging.

89
00:06:24.44 --> 00:06:29.44
I fell on the ground immediately three people sat on my body.

90
00:06:29.44 --> 00:06:30.76
One was on my face.

91
00:06:30.76 --> 00:06:32.60
They were laughing.

92
00:06:32.60 --> 00:06:36.12
They said I used my death to try and scare them.

93
00:06:36.12 --> 00:06:39.96
They said they have just seen this too many times.

94
00:06:39.96 --> 00:06:44.84
They then continued the torture again until that night.

95
00:06:44.84 --> 00:06:49.48
I could not see anything with my eyes anymore.

96
00:06:49.48 --> 00:06:55.36
Every day while I was being held the experience of eating was unusual.

97
00:06:55.36 --> 00:06:59.92
Whenever I was at the point of starving they would bring up mantle which was steamed bread

98
00:06:59.92 --> 00:07:02.52
and offered to me.

99
00:07:02.52 --> 00:07:07.40
If I would sing one of the three famous revolutionary communist party songs I could have

100
00:07:07.40 --> 00:07:09.60
some bread.

101
00:07:09.60 --> 00:07:15.72
My deepest desire was that I wanted to live until that was no longer possible.

102
00:07:15.72 --> 00:07:20.48
My death would be torturous for my wife and children, but at the same time I didn't

103
00:07:20.48 --> 00:07:23.88
want to dirty my soul.

104
00:07:23.88 --> 00:07:29.52
But in that environment human dignity has no strength.

105
00:07:29.52 --> 00:07:34.40
If you don't sing these songs you will continue to be starved and they will continue

106
00:07:34.40 --> 00:07:37.80
to torture you.

107
00:07:37.80 --> 00:07:41.04
So I sang.

108
00:07:41.04 --> 00:07:45.40
And they used the same tactic though, pressuring me to write articles attacking, following

109
00:07:45.40 --> 00:07:46.40
Goon.

110
00:07:46.40 --> 00:07:48.48
I didn't do it.

111
00:07:48.48 --> 00:07:53.24
But I compromised by writing my statement saying that the government didn't kidnap me

112
00:07:53.24 --> 00:07:58.44
and torture me and that they treated me and my family well.

113
00:07:58.44 --> 00:08:03.12
I did sign that document.

114
00:08:03.12 --> 00:08:09.76
During these more than 50 days more horrible evils were committed than I told here.

115
00:08:09.76 --> 00:08:16.08
Those evils were not even worthy of any historical records by any human governments.

116
00:08:16.08 --> 00:08:20.92
But those records will further enable us to see clearly that how much further the leaders

117
00:08:20.92 --> 00:08:26.48
of CCP are willing to go and its evil crime against humanity in order to protect its

118
00:08:26.48 --> 00:08:30.08
illegal monopoly power.

119
00:08:30.08 --> 00:08:34.92
Those evils are so dirty and disgusting that I don't want to mention it at this time

120
00:08:34.92 --> 00:08:39.72
and perhaps will never mention it in the future.

121
00:08:39.72 --> 00:08:44.72
Every time when I was tortured I was always repeatedly threatened that if I spelled out

122
00:08:44.72 --> 00:08:49.80
later what had happened to me I would be tortured again.

123
00:08:49.80 --> 00:08:57.08
But this time I was told this time it will happen in front of your wife and children.

124
00:08:57.08 --> 00:09:02.52
The tall strong man that pulled my hair repeated this over and over during the seven

125
00:09:02.52 --> 00:09:05.52
days I was tortured.

126
00:09:05.52 --> 00:09:10.56
Your death is sure if you share this with the outside world.

127
00:09:10.56 --> 00:09:14.16
This was repeated many times.

128
00:09:14.16 --> 00:09:18.84
These brutal violent acts are not right.

129
00:09:18.84 --> 00:09:27.20
Those that did it themselves knew this clearly in their hearts.

130
00:09:27.20 --> 00:09:43.16
So let's say a note from a guy named Gauzi Cheng who is a Christian lawyer in China that defended

131
00:09:43.16 --> 00:09:48.52
Christians and became an enemy of the Chinese Communist State.

132
00:09:48.52 --> 00:09:55.28
And again this is 2007 that this occurred.

133
00:09:55.28 --> 00:10:02.44
The reason I started off with that tonight is because we're going to delve into some

134
00:10:02.44 --> 00:10:13.32
material that comes from Mount Satan who is one of the most famous and powerful communist

135
00:10:13.32 --> 00:10:17.52
leaders ever.

136
00:10:17.52 --> 00:10:22.76
And the reason that I got interested in this is if you remember or if you went and read

137
00:10:22.76 --> 00:10:29.68
about face by David Hackworth he talks about making all of his subordinates read,

138
00:10:29.68 --> 00:10:33.64
Mount Satan's little red book.

139
00:10:33.64 --> 00:10:40.68
And when I heard Hack say to read that I read many years ago.

140
00:10:40.68 --> 00:10:47.56
And although that's an interesting read it actually led me to a better read.

141
00:10:47.56 --> 00:10:50.40
Also by Mount Satan I got more out of.

142
00:10:50.40 --> 00:10:56.32
And the version that I got was originally put out by the Marine Corps.

143
00:10:56.32 --> 00:11:10.68
And it analyzed and translated Mount Satan's book, Yuchichan, which means Gorilla Warfare.

144
00:11:10.68 --> 00:11:17.76
And I wanted the reason I wanted to start off with this shocking tale of torture.

145
00:11:17.76 --> 00:11:23.28
This is because I wanted to make sure that I highlighted Mao's legacy.

146
00:11:23.28 --> 00:11:30.16
This is a guy that's responsible for millions upon millions of deaths from disease,

147
00:11:30.16 --> 00:11:37.32
in starvation and systematic executions.

148
00:11:37.32 --> 00:11:43.84
And deaths in these labor camps called reform through labor.

149
00:11:43.84 --> 00:11:49.72
So oh you're not quite fitting in, cool, will work you to death.

150
00:11:49.72 --> 00:11:55.68
And the estimates for the number of people that died as a result of him being in power

151
00:11:55.68 --> 00:12:02.52
is between 40 and 80 million.

152
00:12:02.52 --> 00:12:03.76
He's at the top of the list.

153
00:12:03.76 --> 00:12:04.76
He's above Stalin.

154
00:12:04.76 --> 00:12:07.60
He's above Hitler.

155
00:12:07.60 --> 00:12:10.96
And the mist treatment of people continues.

156
00:12:10.96 --> 00:12:14.72
You know, Gao Zi Cheng who I just read, who started it off tonight.

157
00:12:14.72 --> 00:12:23.80
But even now, I just saw a news story about Ding Kumar, who's the wife of a Reverend

158
00:12:23.80 --> 00:12:32.04
who in April this year, this month, stood in front of a bulldozer to stop the state-ordered

159
00:12:32.04 --> 00:12:34.96
demolition of a church.

160
00:12:34.96 --> 00:12:38.64
And they just pushed her into the ditch buried her alive.

161
00:12:38.64 --> 00:12:41.76
And this is still happening.

162
00:12:41.76 --> 00:12:46.88
And so I want to make it perfectly clear that there is massive amounts of evil and

163
00:12:46.88 --> 00:12:52.60
depression racked up in Mao's say tone.

164
00:12:52.60 --> 00:12:57.24
Now what is interesting?

165
00:12:57.24 --> 00:13:07.04
And this is probably why hack, in fact, it is why hack worth read this and had his people

166
00:13:07.04 --> 00:13:15.28
read it is because the military and leadership theories that he espouses, they actually

167
00:13:15.28 --> 00:13:19.92
align with my own principles of leadership, which is crazy.

168
00:13:19.92 --> 00:13:25.88
And it's shocking because I mean, this guy is literally one of the founders of the Chinese

169
00:13:25.88 --> 00:13:27.48
Communist Party.

170
00:13:27.48 --> 00:13:40.48
And obviously, I may believe her in democracy and specifically, I'm a believer in individual

171
00:13:40.48 --> 00:13:46.32
freedom of human beings.

172
00:13:46.32 --> 00:13:50.52
But like I said, interesting, you'll see that many of the leadership principles that

173
00:13:50.52 --> 00:13:56.84
I talk about and that I believe in Mao utilized them.

174
00:13:56.84 --> 00:14:04.32
And I talked them when he was trying to run military and insurgent operations.

175
00:14:04.32 --> 00:14:10.24
And it doesn't surprise me because I know what motivates people and I know how to, I know

176
00:14:10.24 --> 00:14:13.000
the principles that work.

177
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.28
But what is surprising is that he didn't take these leadership principles and lead a nation

178
00:14:20.28 --> 00:14:23.08
like that.

179
00:14:23.08 --> 00:14:29.40
So you're going to see that very clearly when we go through this.

180
00:14:29.40 --> 00:14:41.000
In your part of it's probably has to do with the famous quote from Lord Achtin, which is

181
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:48.04
power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

182
00:14:48.04 --> 00:14:55.80
So it's either that, either he got corrupted or maybe he never realized that the way

183
00:14:55.80 --> 00:15:01.24
you lead and combat is the way you need to lead in life and in business the way you lead

184
00:15:01.24 --> 00:15:06.80
people.

185
00:15:06.80 --> 00:15:10.12
Unfortunately, he never realized that.

186
00:15:10.12 --> 00:15:16.08
So to start this off, this is an introduction and analysis.

187
00:15:16.08 --> 00:15:21.12
This starts off with an introduction and analysis of Mao Saitong and his principles that

188
00:15:21.12 --> 00:15:30.24
was done by a guy named Brigadier General Samuel B. Griffith, United States Marine Corps.

189
00:15:30.24 --> 00:15:36.80
And to put a little background on General Griffith, he served as the executive officer and

190
00:15:36.80 --> 00:15:44.48
later commander of the first Marine Raiders Battalion on Guadalcanal.

191
00:15:44.48 --> 00:15:52.16
He served as the executive officer of the first Raider Regiment in operations on New Georgia.

192
00:15:52.16 --> 00:15:58.56
He received the Navy Cross, which is only second to the Medal of Honor on Guadalcanal.

193
00:15:58.56 --> 00:16:04.08
September 1942 for extreme heroism and courageous devotion to duty during the fighting near

194
00:16:04.08 --> 00:16:11.04
the mountainous river.

195
00:16:11.04 --> 00:16:16.000
In this action, Griffith suffered wounds for which he was awarded the Purple Heart for his

196
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.72
exploits in July in New Georgia.

197
00:16:18.72 --> 00:16:22.28
He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

198
00:16:22.28 --> 00:16:23.60
So this guy is highly decorated.

199
00:16:23.60 --> 00:16:25.16
Here's the bonus here.

200
00:16:25.16 --> 00:16:30.08
He spoke Chinese and he was stationed in China several times.

201
00:16:30.08 --> 00:16:36.28
So this is the guy that actually translated this book from Chinese to English.

202
00:16:36.28 --> 00:16:42.36
So I don't think you could possibly come up with a better person to base this translation

203
00:16:42.36 --> 00:16:46.64
off of then general Griffith.

204
00:16:46.64 --> 00:16:56.04
Pretty awesome to have that kind of person and still be able to look at his work.

205
00:16:56.04 --> 00:16:58.84
So let's get into this book here.

206
00:16:58.84 --> 00:17:06.08
I'll say Tong on guerrilla warfare translated by Samuel B. Griffith.

207
00:17:06.08 --> 00:17:13.36
Malse Tong, the man who was to don the mantle of Lenin was born in Hunan province in

208
00:17:13.36 --> 00:17:17.08
Central China in 1893.

209
00:17:17.08 --> 00:17:22.44
His father, in a industrious farmer, had managed to acquire several acres and with this

210
00:17:22.44 --> 00:17:26.84
land to the status of a middle peasant.

211
00:17:26.84 --> 00:17:33.60
He was a strict disciplinarian and Malse youth was not a happy one.

212
00:17:33.60 --> 00:17:40.80
The boy was in constant conflict with his father but found an ally in his mother whose

213
00:17:40.80 --> 00:17:47.52
indirect tactics as he once described her methods of coping with her husband appealed

214
00:17:47.52 --> 00:17:49.60
to him.

215
00:17:49.60 --> 00:17:52.24
So we already get a little flag here.

216
00:17:52.24 --> 00:17:55.92
You know, here was his guy and he looked at the way his mom dealt with his dad and

217
00:17:55.92 --> 00:17:58.44
she used these indirect tactics.

218
00:17:58.44 --> 00:18:02.44
I talk about that all the time and you're going to see that he uses these indirect

219
00:18:02.44 --> 00:18:05.72
tactics in a military way as well.

220
00:18:05.72 --> 00:18:10.32
Shortly after grad back to the book, shortly after graduating from normal school in 1917,

221
00:18:10.32 --> 00:18:16.24
Malice, deposition as assistant in the peaking university library.

222
00:18:16.24 --> 00:18:24.24
Here he associated himself with Marxist study groups.

223
00:18:24.24 --> 00:18:30.96
Here he discovered Lenin, Redis Essays, poured over Trotsky's explosive speeches and began

224
00:18:30.96 --> 00:18:34.40
to study Marx and Engels.

225
00:18:34.40 --> 00:18:43.48
By 1920, Mal was a convinced communist and a man who had discovered his mission to create

226
00:18:43.48 --> 00:18:49.12
a new China according to the doctrine of Marx and Lenin.

227
00:18:49.12 --> 00:18:58.56
And the CCP was organized in Shanghai in 1921, Mal joined.

228
00:18:58.56 --> 00:19:06.000
So that sort of where it begins and now skipping through some of the evolution and getting

229
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.16
right into strategy, tactics and logistics in revolutionary war.

230
00:19:12.16 --> 00:19:13.48
Here's one of his quotes.

231
00:19:13.48 --> 00:19:20.16
The first law of war is to preserve ourselves and destroy the enemy.

232
00:19:20.16 --> 00:19:21.52
Very simple.

233
00:19:21.52 --> 00:19:23.36
I talk about simplicity all the time.

234
00:19:23.36 --> 00:19:24.68
We wrote about it in the book.

235
00:19:24.68 --> 00:19:33.64
Is there any more simple principle to wage war other than the first law of war to preserve

236
00:19:33.64 --> 00:19:40.44
ourselves and destroy the enemy?

237
00:19:40.44 --> 00:19:45.80
Mal has never claimed that guerilla action alone is decisive in a struggle for political control

238
00:19:45.80 --> 00:19:47.48
of the state.

239
00:19:47.48 --> 00:19:54.36
But only that it is a possible, natural, and necessary development in an agrarian-based revolutionary

240
00:19:54.36 --> 00:19:55.36
war.

241
00:19:55.36 --> 00:20:02.60
So he doesn't think it can do everything, but he knows it pays a very critical part.

242
00:20:02.60 --> 00:20:12.64
Christians rarely compromise.

243
00:20:12.64 --> 00:20:19.96
Compromises are made only to further the strategic design.

244
00:20:19.96 --> 00:20:21.84
I'll read that again.

245
00:20:21.84 --> 00:20:22.84
Compromises are made only to further the strategic design.

246
00:20:22.84 --> 00:20:28.36
Negotiation then is undertaken for the dual purpose of gaining time to buttress a position

247
00:20:28.36 --> 00:20:34.48
and to wear down, frustrate, and harass an opponent.

248
00:20:34.48 --> 00:20:36.12
So this is again.

249
00:20:36.12 --> 00:20:38.12
We talked about this on the last podcast.

250
00:20:38.12 --> 00:20:39.84
It's not about being right.

251
00:20:39.84 --> 00:20:48.04
You make those compromises because you're trying to win the war, not the battle.

252
00:20:48.04 --> 00:20:51.68
Intelligence is the decisive factor in planning guerilla operations.

253
00:20:51.68 --> 00:20:52.68
Where is the enemy?

254
00:20:52.68 --> 00:20:53.96
In what strength?

255
00:20:53.96 --> 00:20:55.80
What does he propose to do?

256
00:20:55.80 --> 00:20:59.24
What is the state of his equipment as supply is morale?

257
00:20:59.24 --> 00:21:03.32
Are his leaders intelligent bold and imaginative or stupid?

258
00:21:03.32 --> 00:21:09.04
Are his troops tough, efficient, and well-disciplined, or poorly trained and soft?

259
00:21:09.04 --> 00:21:13.52
Guerilla's expect the members of their intelligence service to provide the answers to these

260
00:21:13.52 --> 00:21:17.20
and dozens of more detailed questions.

261
00:21:17.20 --> 00:21:22.16
Guerilla intelligence nets are tightly organized and pervasive.

262
00:21:22.16 --> 00:21:28.44
In a guerilla area, every person without exception must be considered an agent.

263
00:21:28.44 --> 00:21:35.20
Old men and women, boys driving ox carts, girls tending goats, farm labor, storekeeper, school

264
00:21:35.20 --> 00:21:40.60
teachers, priest, boatmen, scavengers.

265
00:21:40.60 --> 00:21:47.04
So when you're dealing with a guerilla situation, everybody's an intelligence gather.

266
00:21:47.04 --> 00:21:49.44
And that's how you have to treat them all.

267
00:21:49.44 --> 00:21:56.44
As a guerilla's derny, all information of themselves to their enemy, who is enveloped

268
00:21:56.44 --> 00:22:00.88
in an impenetrable fog.

269
00:22:00.88 --> 00:22:05.52
This is a characteristic feature of all guerilla wars.

270
00:22:05.52 --> 00:22:08.88
The enemy stands on a lighted stage.

271
00:22:08.88 --> 00:22:14.92
From the darkness around him thousands of unseen eyes intently study his every move,

272
00:22:14.92 --> 00:22:17.12
his every gesture.

273
00:22:17.12 --> 00:22:23.84
And he strikes out, he hits air, his antagonist are in substantial, as intangible, as

274
00:22:23.84 --> 00:22:26.56
fleeting shadows in the moonlight.

275
00:22:26.56 --> 00:22:32.40
That's a great way of looking at it.

276
00:22:32.40 --> 00:22:37.92
Back to the book, because of superior information, Guerilla's always engaged under conditions

277
00:22:37.92 --> 00:22:39.84
of their own choosing.

278
00:22:39.84 --> 00:22:45.12
Because of superior knowledge of terrain, they're able to use their advantage and the enemies

279
00:22:45.12 --> 00:22:46.64
discomfort.

280
00:22:46.64 --> 00:22:55.08
And guerilla's fight only when the chances of victory are weighed heavily in their favor.

281
00:22:55.08 --> 00:22:57.24
What a great tactic.

282
00:22:57.24 --> 00:23:02.16
Only fight when chances of victory are weighed heavily in their favor.

283
00:23:02.16 --> 00:23:10.04
If the tide of battle unexpectedly flows against them, they withdraw.

284
00:23:10.04 --> 00:23:16.12
They rely only on a magic leadership, distraction, surprise, and mobility to create

285
00:23:16.12 --> 00:23:22.12
victorious situation before the battle is joined.

286
00:23:22.12 --> 00:23:26.20
This is all stuff to think about in everything that you do.

287
00:23:26.20 --> 00:23:30.48
Why are you going to a battle if you've not prepared and set the situation up where you're

288
00:23:30.48 --> 00:23:33.80
going to be victorious?

289
00:23:33.80 --> 00:23:37.60
If you start losing, don't stand there and take a beating.

290
00:23:37.60 --> 00:23:43.40
Just walk away, fade away.

291
00:23:43.40 --> 00:23:46.40
The enemy is deceived and again deceived.

292
00:23:46.40 --> 00:23:50.84
Attacks are sudden, sharp, vicious, and of short duration.

293
00:23:50.84 --> 00:23:52.64
Many are harassing in nature.

294
00:23:52.64 --> 00:23:59.32
Others are designed to dislocate the enemy's plans and to agitate and confuse his commanders.

295
00:23:59.32 --> 00:24:04.72
The mind of the enemy and the will of his leaders is a target of far more importance than

296
00:24:04.72 --> 00:24:10.68
the bodies of his troops.

297
00:24:10.68 --> 00:24:17.000
So this is an attack on the will of the leaders.

298
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:17.68
And how do you do that?

299
00:24:17.68 --> 00:24:19.000
You confuse him.

300
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.56
You harass him.

301
00:24:22.56 --> 00:24:30.76
Mal once remarked, not entirely false, that guerrillas must be experts at running away since

302
00:24:30.76 --> 00:24:32.60
they do it so often.

303
00:24:32.60 --> 00:24:35.20
They avoid static dispositions.

304
00:24:35.20 --> 00:24:40.24
Their effort is always to keep the situation as fluid as possible to strike where and

305
00:24:40.24 --> 00:24:43.76
when the enemy least expects them.

306
00:24:43.76 --> 00:24:54.40
Only in this way, can they retain the initiative and so be assured of freedom of action.

307
00:24:54.40 --> 00:24:58.56
And this is exactly what Hackworth wanted to do in Vietnam.

308
00:24:58.56 --> 00:25:00.16
He wanted to fight the guerrillas.

309
00:25:00.16 --> 00:25:01.40
He calls them Gs in the book.

310
00:25:01.40 --> 00:25:06.44
He wanted to fight the G like a G. He wanted to fight the guerrillas like guerrillas.

311
00:25:06.44 --> 00:25:07.44
And that was what upset him.

312
00:25:07.44 --> 00:25:10.64
That's what we kept doing these big conventional operations.

313
00:25:10.64 --> 00:25:12.64
Well, you do a big conventional operation.

314
00:25:12.64 --> 00:25:14.28
The enemy disappears.

315
00:25:14.28 --> 00:25:16.24
They leave behind some booby traps for you.

316
00:25:16.24 --> 00:25:17.64
They take some sniper shots.

317
00:25:17.64 --> 00:25:18.92
They hit you with some indirect fire.

318
00:25:18.92 --> 00:25:19.92
You take casualties.

319
00:25:19.92 --> 00:25:21.28
They don't.

320
00:25:21.28 --> 00:25:26.08
Because they disappeared.

321
00:25:26.08 --> 00:25:33.48
guerrilla operations conducted over a wide region are necessarily decentralized.

322
00:25:33.48 --> 00:25:37.92
Each regional commander must be familiar with local conditions and take advantage of local

323
00:25:37.92 --> 00:25:40.12
opportunities.

324
00:25:40.12 --> 00:25:44.60
The same applies to commands in subordinate districts.

325
00:25:44.60 --> 00:25:50.40
This decentralized decentralization is to some extent forced upon the guerrillas because

326
00:25:50.40 --> 00:25:56.20
they lack a well-developed system of technical communications.

327
00:25:56.20 --> 00:26:03.44
But at the same time, decentralization for normal operations has many advantages, particularly

328
00:26:03.44 --> 00:26:11.20
if local leaders are ingenious and bold.

329
00:26:11.20 --> 00:26:15.04
One of the laws of combat that lay for an right about in the book.

330
00:26:15.04 --> 00:26:16.84
Decentralized command.

331
00:26:16.84 --> 00:26:19.92
You've got to let your subordinate leaders lead.

332
00:26:19.92 --> 00:26:20.92
You have to do it.

333
00:26:20.92 --> 00:26:26.12
You have to let the people know what the strategy is and let them go execute.

334
00:26:26.12 --> 00:26:29.64
And what so bizarre about this is not the way a communist government runs.

335
00:26:29.64 --> 00:26:30.88
They control everything.

336
00:26:30.88 --> 00:26:31.88
They try and control everything.

337
00:26:31.88 --> 00:26:34.04
Nothing, everything is centralized.

338
00:26:34.04 --> 00:26:35.32
Everything is centralized.

339
00:26:35.32 --> 00:26:39.92
And that's why it doesn't work.

340
00:26:39.92 --> 00:26:41.48
The enemy back to the book.

341
00:26:41.48 --> 00:26:44.32
The enemy's rear is the guerrillas front.

342
00:26:44.32 --> 00:26:46.20
They themselves have no rear.

343
00:26:46.20 --> 00:26:50.64
Their logistical problems are solved in a direct and elementary fashion.

344
00:26:50.64 --> 00:26:56.92
The enemy is the principal source of weapons, equipment, and ammunition.

345
00:26:56.92 --> 00:26:58.000
Such the guerrillas says.

346
00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.64
They don't have to worry about logistics.

347
00:26:59.64 --> 00:27:03.80
They're going to get it from their enemy.

348
00:27:03.80 --> 00:27:14.36
Now once said, we have a claim on the output of the arsenals of London as well as of

349
00:27:14.36 --> 00:27:15.96
hanging.

350
00:27:15.96 --> 00:27:23.16
What is more, it is to be delivered to us by the enemy's own transport corps.

351
00:27:23.16 --> 00:27:27.40
This is the sober truth, not a joke.

352
00:27:27.40 --> 00:27:29.64
So they have, where do they get their weapons from?

353
00:27:29.64 --> 00:27:30.64
Their enemy.

354
00:27:30.64 --> 00:27:36.36
And their enemy just delivers them to them.

355
00:27:36.36 --> 00:27:43.24
It is interesting to examine Mao's strategic and tactical theories in the light of his

356
00:27:43.24 --> 00:27:47.08
principal unity of opposites.

357
00:27:47.08 --> 00:27:52.60
Okay, so Mao had this principal unity of opposites.

358
00:27:52.60 --> 00:27:56.40
You may have this might seem a little bit familiar.

359
00:27:56.40 --> 00:28:02.28
If you read the book, if you read our book, the dichotomy leadership.

360
00:28:02.28 --> 00:28:03.80
They're opposites.

361
00:28:03.80 --> 00:28:09.12
So here's Mao's principal called Unity of opposites.

362
00:28:09.12 --> 00:28:10.56
This seems to be back to the book.

363
00:28:10.56 --> 00:28:15.48
This seems to be an adaptation to military action of the ancient Chinese philosophical

364
00:28:15.48 --> 00:28:18.08
concept of Yin Yang.

365
00:28:18.08 --> 00:28:23.12
Briefly, the Yin and Yang are elemental and pervasive.

366
00:28:23.12 --> 00:28:31.16
Of opposite polarities, they represent male and female, dark and light, cold and heat,

367
00:28:31.16 --> 00:28:34.16
recession and aggression.

368
00:28:34.16 --> 00:28:38.40
Their reciprocal interaction is endless.

369
00:28:38.40 --> 00:28:43.76
So again, people have said, hey, now I know a new word dichotomy.

370
00:28:43.76 --> 00:28:45.40
That's what this is.

371
00:28:45.40 --> 00:28:46.40
It's dichotomy.

372
00:28:46.40 --> 00:28:49.88
It's opposing forces.

373
00:28:49.88 --> 00:28:54.92
And now this just gets even more aligned.

374
00:28:54.92 --> 00:29:01.28
An important postulate of the Yin Yang theory is that concealed within strength, there is

375
00:29:01.28 --> 00:29:06.36
weakness and within weakness strength.

376
00:29:06.36 --> 00:29:11.12
It is a weakness of gorillas that they operate in small groups that can be wiped out in

377
00:29:11.12 --> 00:29:13.52
a matter of minutes.

378
00:29:13.52 --> 00:29:18.56
But because they do operate in small groups, they can move rapidly and secretly into the

379
00:29:18.56 --> 00:29:22.40
vulnerable rear of the enemy.

380
00:29:22.40 --> 00:29:27.28
In conventional tactics, dispersion of forces invites destruction.

381
00:29:27.28 --> 00:29:32.80
In guerilla war, this very tactic is desirable both to confuse the enemy and to preserve

382
00:29:32.80 --> 00:29:40.16
the illusion that the gorillas are ubiquitous.

383
00:29:40.16 --> 00:29:47.68
It is often often a disinvenged, not to have heavy infantry and heavy infantry weapons

384
00:29:47.68 --> 00:29:48.68
available.

385
00:29:48.68 --> 00:29:53.36
But the very fact of having to transport them has until recently tied conventional

386
00:29:53.36 --> 00:29:56.72
columns to roads and well-used tracks.

387
00:29:56.72 --> 00:29:59.72
The guerilla travels light and travels fast.

388
00:29:59.72 --> 00:30:03.56
He turns the hazard of terrain into his advantage.

389
00:30:03.56 --> 00:30:10.56
And makes an ally of tropical rains, heavy snow, intense heat and freezing cold.

390
00:30:10.56 --> 00:30:13.60
Long night marches are difficult and dangerous.

391
00:30:13.60 --> 00:30:20.40
But the darkness shields his approach to an unsuspecting enemy.

392
00:30:20.40 --> 00:30:30.08
In every apparent disinvenged, some advantage is to be found.

393
00:30:30.08 --> 00:30:33.60
In other words, good.

394
00:30:33.60 --> 00:30:35.52
The converse is equally true.

395
00:30:35.52 --> 00:30:40.88
In each apparent advantage lie the seeds of disinvenged.

396
00:30:40.88 --> 00:30:48.000
The Yin is not wholly in nor the Yang wholly Yang.

397
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.04
It is only the Wise General, said the ancient Chinese military philosopher Sun Zu, who

398
00:30:54.04 --> 00:31:00.40
is able to recognize this fact and turn it to a good account.

399
00:31:00.40 --> 00:31:07.56
guerilla tactical doctrine may be summarized in four Chinese characters, which mean uproar

400
00:31:07.56 --> 00:31:12.28
in the east strike in the west.

401
00:31:12.28 --> 00:31:16.96
Here we find, expressed the all-important principles of distraction on the one hand and

402
00:31:16.96 --> 00:31:18.92
concentration on the other.

403
00:31:18.92 --> 00:31:26.56
To fix the enemy's attention and to strike, wear and when he least anticipates the blow.

404
00:31:26.56 --> 00:31:32.36
guerillas are masters of the arts of simulation and dissimulation, the create pretenses,

405
00:31:32.36 --> 00:31:37.32
and simultaneously disguise or conceal their true semblance.

406
00:31:37.32 --> 00:31:45.96
Their tactical concepts, dynamic and flexible, are not cut to any particular pattern.

407
00:31:45.96 --> 00:31:54.12
But Mao's first law of war to preserve oneself and destroy the enemy is always governing.

408
00:31:54.12 --> 00:32:01.20
Yeah, it's just amazing the amount of similarities.

409
00:32:01.20 --> 00:32:06.36
And I guess at some point in my life, I'm going to stop being amazed that on the fact that

410
00:32:06.36 --> 00:32:11.96
the basic principles of war and the basic principles of life, they've been around for thousands

411
00:32:11.96 --> 00:32:14.08
and thousands of years.

412
00:32:14.08 --> 00:32:17.80
And for whatever reason, we just have to relearn them.

413
00:32:17.80 --> 00:32:23.68
I wrote the dichotomy leadership or fought the dichotomy leadership.

414
00:32:23.68 --> 00:32:25.52
I didn't think about Yang and Yang.

415
00:32:25.52 --> 00:32:28.12
I showed off if I paid more attention.

416
00:32:28.12 --> 00:32:29.12
Yeah.

417
00:32:29.12 --> 00:32:31.12
I went away, you did think of Yang and Yang.

418
00:32:31.12 --> 00:32:33.56
He used to even call it Yang.

419
00:32:33.56 --> 00:32:37.68
And I'm saying that didn't spark my thoughts as a lesson that I learned.

420
00:32:37.68 --> 00:32:39.04
It wasn't taught to me.

421
00:32:39.04 --> 00:32:40.04
Right.

422
00:32:40.04 --> 00:32:41.04
Yeah.

423
00:32:41.04 --> 00:32:43.40
Which is sad.

424
00:32:43.40 --> 00:32:45.32
I could have been away.

425
00:32:45.32 --> 00:32:49.36
Like you've been saying, if I had to read more and fought more, maybe I'd have figured

426
00:32:49.36 --> 00:32:51.96
it out earlier.

427
00:32:51.96 --> 00:32:54.88
Going on back to the book.

428
00:32:54.88 --> 00:33:00.68
At the present time, much attention is being devoted to the development of gadgetry.

429
00:33:00.68 --> 00:33:02.16
So he goes on this again.

430
00:33:02.16 --> 00:33:06.000
This is still General Griffith that's talking.

431
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.16
And he's saying something that we hear all the time when I was in the military all the

432
00:33:09.16 --> 00:33:10.16
time.

433
00:33:10.16 --> 00:33:12.72
You hear that we're going to get this new technology and that's going to change everything

434
00:33:12.72 --> 00:33:19.84
and then we're going to be in technology's great, but it's not the key component of war.

435
00:33:19.84 --> 00:33:24.92
And he says this, I do not mean to suggest that proper weapons and equipment will not

436
00:33:24.92 --> 00:33:27.92
play an important part in anti-Gerilla operations.

437
00:33:27.92 --> 00:33:29.64
For of course, they will.

438
00:33:29.64 --> 00:33:34.04
That's enough, it should be made to improve communication, food, medical and surgical

439
00:33:34.04 --> 00:33:39.24
packs, weapons and ammunition must be drastically reduced and wait.

440
00:33:39.24 --> 00:33:44.44
There seems to be no technical reason why a sturdy, light, accurate, automatic rifle weighing

441
00:33:44.44 --> 00:33:48.24
a maximum of four to five pounds cannot be developed.

442
00:33:48.24 --> 00:33:51.96
And the search for new and effective weapons must continue.

443
00:33:51.96 --> 00:33:59.12
But we must realize that flame thrower like guns and bullets are only a very small part

444
00:33:59.12 --> 00:34:04.64
of the answer to a challenging and complex problem.

445
00:34:04.64 --> 00:34:12.08
The tactics of guerrillas must be used against the guerrillas themselves.

446
00:34:12.08 --> 00:34:17.12
Again, this is exactly what Hackworth gave up his career in the army over.

447
00:34:17.12 --> 00:34:21.72
This is how he wanted a fight and people were not listening to him.

448
00:34:21.72 --> 00:34:26.16
They must be constantly herried and constantly attacked.

449
00:34:26.16 --> 00:34:31.32
Every effort must be made to induce defections and take prisoners.

450
00:34:31.32 --> 00:34:37.32
The best source of information of the enemy is men who know the enemy situation.

451
00:34:37.32 --> 00:34:41.36
Imaginative, intelligent, and bold leadership.

452
00:34:41.36 --> 00:34:45.52
Now again, this is General Griffith talking about what it takes to be to guerrilla.

453
00:34:45.52 --> 00:34:52.44
Imaginative, intelligent, and bold leadership is absolutely essential.

454
00:34:52.44 --> 00:35:01.56
Anders and leaders at every echelon must be selected with these specific qualities in mind.

455
00:35:01.56 --> 00:35:02.56
People don't think that.

456
00:35:02.56 --> 00:35:03.56
This is the Marine Corps.

457
00:35:03.56 --> 00:35:04.56
Marine Corps General.

458
00:35:04.56 --> 00:35:09.36
His number one characteristic is imagination.

459
00:35:09.36 --> 00:35:14.36
That's his number one characteristic.

460
00:35:14.36 --> 00:35:19.60
Officers and NCOs who are more than competent under normal conditions will frequently

461
00:35:19.60 --> 00:35:25.72
be hopelessly ineffective when confronted with the dynamic and totally different situation

462
00:35:25.72 --> 00:35:33.16
characteristics of guerrilla warfare.

463
00:35:33.16 --> 00:35:38.64
Who would have thought that the Marine Corps General says that the most important.

464
00:35:38.64 --> 00:35:40.12
He's not talking about bravery.

465
00:35:40.12 --> 00:35:42.12
He's not talking about anything physical.

466
00:35:42.12 --> 00:35:49.04
He's talking about imagination and intelligence and leadership.

467
00:35:49.04 --> 00:35:54.72
That's what wins.

468
00:35:54.72 --> 00:36:02.12
Okay, now we're going to get to the actual words from Mao Saitong.

469
00:36:02.12 --> 00:36:14.08
And his, again, his section in this book is called very simply guerrilla warfare.

470
00:36:14.08 --> 00:36:16.92
And let's hear what he has to say about leadership.

471
00:36:16.92 --> 00:36:22.28
All guerrilla units must have political and military leadership.

472
00:36:22.28 --> 00:36:27.48
This is true regardless of the source or size of such units.

473
00:36:27.48 --> 00:36:32.16
Such units may originate locally in the masses of the people.

474
00:36:32.16 --> 00:36:38.44
They may be formed from a mixture of regular troops with the groups of people.

475
00:36:38.44 --> 00:36:44.000
Or they may consist of regular, regular army units intact.

476
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.72
The mere quantity does not affect this matter.

477
00:36:47.72 --> 00:36:52.20
Such units may consist of a squad of a few men of a Italian of several hundred men or

478
00:36:52.20 --> 00:36:55.92
regiment of several thousand men.

479
00:36:55.92 --> 00:37:00.32
All these must have leaders who are unyielding in their policies.

480
00:37:00.32 --> 00:37:04.40
Resilute, loyal, sincere, and robust.

481
00:37:04.40 --> 00:37:10.24
These men must be well educated in revolutionary technique, self-confident, able to establish

482
00:37:10.24 --> 00:37:15.88
severe discipline and able to cope with counter propaganda.

483
00:37:15.88 --> 00:37:20.000
In short, these leaders must be models for the people.

484
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.80
As the war progresses, such leaders will gradually overcome the lack of discipline, which

485
00:37:25.80 --> 00:37:27.68
at first prevails.

486
00:37:27.68 --> 00:37:32.40
They will establish discipline in their forces, strengthening them, and increasing their combat

487
00:37:32.40 --> 00:37:34.04
efficiency.

488
00:37:34.04 --> 00:37:38.56
Thus, eventual victory will be attained.

489
00:37:38.56 --> 00:37:45.04
One organized guerilla warfare cannot contribute to victory.

490
00:37:45.04 --> 00:37:51.20
So clearly once again, leadership is the key component.

491
00:37:51.20 --> 00:37:54.000
He goes into a little bit more of that.

492
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.84
But first, now is talking about this.

493
00:37:57.84 --> 00:38:01.40
What is the basic guerilla strategy?

494
00:38:01.40 --> 00:38:07.52
Guerilla strategy must be based primarily on alertness, mobility, and attack.

495
00:38:07.52 --> 00:38:12.88
It must be adjusted to the enemy situation, the terrain, the existing lines of communications,

496
00:38:12.88 --> 00:38:17.08
the relative strengths, the weather, and the situation of the people.

497
00:38:17.08 --> 00:38:19.44
You've got to have total adaptability.

498
00:38:19.44 --> 00:38:20.44
Right?

499
00:38:20.44 --> 00:38:23.44
Total adaptability.

500
00:38:23.44 --> 00:38:28.72
In guerilla warfare, select the tactic of seeming to come from the east and attacking

501
00:38:28.72 --> 00:38:34.80
from the west, avoid the solid attack the hollow, attack with draw, deliver lightning

502
00:38:34.80 --> 00:38:37.28
blow, seek a lightning decision.

503
00:38:37.28 --> 00:38:41.96
When guerilla is engaged in a stronger enemy, they withdraw when he advances.

504
00:38:41.96 --> 00:38:46.60
Harassin when he stops, striking when he's weary, pursuant when he withdraws.

505
00:38:46.60 --> 00:38:51.80
In guerilla strategy, the enemy's rear, flanks, and other vulnerable spots are his

506
00:38:51.80 --> 00:38:58.92
vital points, and there he must be harassed, attacked, dispersed, exhausted, and annihilated.

507
00:38:58.92 --> 00:39:03.40
Only in this way, can guerilla carry out their mission of independent guerilla action and

508
00:39:03.40 --> 00:39:07.72
coordination with the effort of the regular armies.

509
00:39:07.72 --> 00:39:13.64
But in spite of the most complete preparation, there can be no victory if mistakes are made

510
00:39:13.64 --> 00:39:22.92
in the matter of command.

511
00:39:22.92 --> 00:39:25.04
Very obvious now.

512
00:39:25.04 --> 00:39:26.80
We're seeing what the warfare is.

513
00:39:26.80 --> 00:39:29.88
If you're not familiar with it, it's very obvious what it is.

514
00:39:29.88 --> 00:39:32.64
And it's very similar to Gjitsu.

515
00:39:32.64 --> 00:39:37.48
You're setting people up, you're not going against their strengths, you're letting people

516
00:39:37.48 --> 00:39:42.04
move, and it's what we talk about all in here when we talk about dealing with other human

517
00:39:42.04 --> 00:39:43.84
beings.

518
00:39:43.84 --> 00:39:47.12
Don't go head to head with them on that point that they're dug in on.

519
00:39:47.12 --> 00:39:50.92
You're not going to, you're all you're going to do is create adversity.

520
00:39:50.92 --> 00:39:52.000
You're going to get a fight.

521
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
That's what you're going to get.

522
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.88
You don't want to fight.

523
00:39:54.88 --> 00:39:59.96
The other thing that's interesting about this is I start to see slivers into the psychology

524
00:39:59.96 --> 00:40:05.72
of Mao, where he says here, there can be no victory from mistakes are made in the matter

525
00:40:05.72 --> 00:40:06.72
of command.

526
00:40:06.72 --> 00:40:11.20
You can see where that starts to show a micromanager.

527
00:40:11.20 --> 00:40:14.28
And really if you look at a communist, come on, that's just a giant micromanagement

528
00:40:14.28 --> 00:40:19.000
of trying to control everything that you can.

529
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:27.32
So he starts seeing shades of that psychology of the micromanager.

530
00:40:27.32 --> 00:40:29.16
Continuing back to the book.

531
00:40:29.16 --> 00:40:35.000
The strategy of guerrilla warfare is manifestly unlike that employed in Orthodox operations.

532
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:41.32
As the basic tactic of the former is constant activity and movement.

533
00:40:41.32 --> 00:40:45.80
There is in guerrilla warfare no such thing as a decisive battle.

534
00:40:45.80 --> 00:40:50.48
There's nothing comparable to the fixed passive defense that characterizes Orthodox

535
00:40:50.48 --> 00:40:51.48
War.

536
00:40:51.48 --> 00:40:57.96
In guerrilla warfare, transformation of a moving situation into a positional defensive situation

537
00:40:57.96 --> 00:40:58.96
never arises.

538
00:40:58.96 --> 00:41:01.52
I'm going to read that again.

539
00:41:01.52 --> 00:41:08.76
In guerrilla warfare, the transformation of a moving situation into positional defensive

540
00:41:08.76 --> 00:41:11.08
situation never arises.

541
00:41:11.08 --> 00:41:14.16
So if you're on the move and you're attacking the enemy and all of a sudden they start

542
00:41:14.16 --> 00:41:23.56
getting the upper hand, you don't dig in, you disappear, you go away.

543
00:41:23.56 --> 00:41:28.52
Now we start talking again that this is, I started saying that I start seeing the slivers

544
00:41:28.52 --> 00:41:34.12
of psychology of mal that might turn them into a micromanager, but the guy had to run this

545
00:41:34.12 --> 00:41:38.96
war and he knew there was only one way to do it and that's using the basic principles

546
00:41:38.96 --> 00:41:41.44
of combat leadership.

547
00:41:41.44 --> 00:41:42.80
And here he talks about it.

548
00:41:42.80 --> 00:41:48.000
There are differences also in the matter of leadership and command.

549
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.44
In guerrilla warfare, small units acting independently play the principle role and there

550
00:41:54.44 --> 00:42:00.56
must be no excessive interference with their activities.

551
00:42:00.56 --> 00:42:02.52
So here's Mal.

552
00:42:02.52 --> 00:42:07.64
The guy that tries to control me, the lead communism which tries to control everything

553
00:42:07.64 --> 00:42:12.92
for the state and he's saying that there must be no excessive interference with their

554
00:42:12.92 --> 00:42:21.36
activities, individual freedom, who would have thought that Mal is a proponent of individual

555
00:42:21.36 --> 00:42:23.40
freedom.

556
00:42:23.40 --> 00:42:27.52
In Orthodox warfare, particularly in a moving situation, a certain degree of initiative

557
00:42:27.52 --> 00:42:31.92
is accorded to subordinates, but in principle command is centralized.

558
00:42:31.92 --> 00:42:35.52
So in, you know, he's talking about conventional war and he's talking about how command is

559
00:42:35.52 --> 00:42:37.52
centralized.

560
00:42:37.52 --> 00:42:41.92
This is done because small units and all supporting arms and all district must coordinate

561
00:42:41.92 --> 00:42:47.28
it's the highest degree in the which is actually not true.

562
00:42:47.28 --> 00:42:52.32
It's possible to and there's no doubt that decentralized command even in a big conventional

563
00:42:52.32 --> 00:42:57.60
war is infinitely better than centralized command.

564
00:42:57.60 --> 00:43:04.72
In the case of guerrilla warfare, this is not only undesirable but impossible.

565
00:43:04.72 --> 00:43:09.04
Only adjacent guerrilla units can coordinate their activities to any degree so we can only

566
00:43:09.04 --> 00:43:11.60
coordinate if I'm right next to you.

567
00:43:11.60 --> 00:43:15.96
And strategically, their activities can be roughly correlated with those of the regular forces

568
00:43:15.96 --> 00:43:20.88
and tactically, they must cooperate with adjacent units of the regular army.

569
00:43:20.88 --> 00:43:27.60
But there are no strictures on the extent of guerrilla activity nor is it primarily characterized

570
00:43:27.60 --> 00:43:31.12
by the quality of cooperation of many units.

571
00:43:31.12 --> 00:43:34.64
It's what you do on your own.

572
00:43:34.64 --> 00:43:39.72
It's what each individual leader does with his little team.

573
00:43:39.72 --> 00:43:42.32
That's decentralized command.

574
00:43:42.32 --> 00:43:44.08
And by the way, that's free market.

575
00:43:44.08 --> 00:43:47.20
That's capitalism.

576
00:43:47.20 --> 00:43:53.04
And it's unfortunate that Mao knew this for guerrilla warfare but he couldn't make the

577
00:43:53.04 --> 00:43:55.64
connection.

578
00:43:55.64 --> 00:43:59.92
Or like I said, maybe he did but he just grew up to a power.

579
00:43:59.92 --> 00:44:06.000
When we discuss the terms front and rear, it must be remembered that while guerrillas

580
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:12.12
do have bases, their primary field of activity is in the enemy's rear areas.

581
00:44:12.12 --> 00:44:16.96
They themselves have no rear.

582
00:44:16.96 --> 00:44:18.96
That's the equivalent of Genjujitsu.

583
00:44:18.96 --> 00:44:21.000
You don't give up your back.

584
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:29.20
Well the military, you don't want somebody to be behind you.

585
00:44:29.20 --> 00:44:31.32
Where do these guerrillas come from?

586
00:44:31.32 --> 00:44:32.32
Here's Mao.

587
00:44:32.32 --> 00:44:37.48
There are those who say, I am a farmer or I am a student.

588
00:44:37.48 --> 00:44:41.92
I can discuss literature but not military arts.

589
00:44:41.92 --> 00:44:43.80
This is incorrect.

590
00:44:43.80 --> 00:44:49.32
There is no profound difference between the farmer and the soldier.

591
00:44:49.32 --> 00:44:50.96
You must have courage.

592
00:44:50.96 --> 00:44:54.28
You simply leave your farms and become soldiers.

593
00:44:54.28 --> 00:44:56.84
That your farmers is of no difference.

594
00:44:56.84 --> 00:45:00.84
And if you have an education, that is so much better.

595
00:45:00.84 --> 00:45:04.84
When you take arms in your hand, you become soldiers.

596
00:45:04.84 --> 00:45:09.36
When you are organized, you become military units.

597
00:45:09.36 --> 00:45:13.80
guerrilla hostilities are the University of War.

598
00:45:13.80 --> 00:45:19.12
And after you have fought several times, valiantly and aggressively, you may become

599
00:45:19.12 --> 00:45:23.96
a leader of troops.

600
00:45:23.96 --> 00:45:34.36
You gotta get out there on the battlefield and you'll learn.

601
00:45:34.36 --> 00:45:37.08
I found this interesting.

602
00:45:37.08 --> 00:45:43.48
In spite of inescapable differences in the fundamental types of guerrilla bands, it is possible

603
00:45:43.48 --> 00:45:50.08
to unite them to form a vast sea of guerrillas.

604
00:45:50.08 --> 00:45:56.56
The ancient said, Tai Shan is a great mountain because it does not scorn the mirrored handful

605
00:45:56.56 --> 00:45:58.16
of dirt.

606
00:45:58.16 --> 00:46:04.88
The rivers and seas are deep because they absorb the waters of small streams.

607
00:46:04.88 --> 00:46:09.84
Attention paid to the enlistment and organization of guerrillas of every type and form,

608
00:46:09.84 --> 00:46:17.96
every source will increase the potentialities of guerrillas in action.

609
00:46:17.96 --> 00:46:22.84
They're going to take everybody and it's important to take everybody.

610
00:46:22.84 --> 00:46:32.52
Everybody that shows up is getting in the game.

611
00:46:32.52 --> 00:46:39.36
Again, this is a point that is so bizarre to hear from now.

612
00:46:39.36 --> 00:46:41.40
Here he goes.

613
00:46:41.40 --> 00:46:47.60
The people must be inspired to cooperate voluntarily.

614
00:46:47.60 --> 00:46:50.48
We must not force them.

615
00:46:50.48 --> 00:46:55.28
For if we do, it will be in effectual.

616
00:46:55.28 --> 00:47:01.76
This is extremely important.

617
00:47:01.76 --> 00:47:06.88
Now I wish you would have read your own book.

618
00:47:06.88 --> 00:47:08.60
I wish you would have read your own book.

619
00:47:08.60 --> 00:47:12.40
The people must be inspired to cooperate voluntarily.

620
00:47:12.40 --> 00:47:14.000
We must not force them.

621
00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.96
For if we do, it will be in effectual.

622
00:47:16.96 --> 00:47:19.72
This is something that I talk about all the time.

623
00:47:19.72 --> 00:47:23.32
Just giving people orders does not work.

624
00:47:23.32 --> 00:47:25.32
You need to lead them.

625
00:47:25.32 --> 00:47:27.000
You need to inspire them.

626
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.76
You need to get them to do things because they want to do them.

627
00:47:32.76 --> 00:47:48.92
You need to get them to do them.

628
00:47:48.92 --> 00:47:51.88
Getting into the officers a little bit, the leadership.

629
00:47:51.88 --> 00:47:57.64
Since each guerrilla group fights in a protracted war, its officers must be brave and positive

630
00:47:57.64 --> 00:48:04.76
men whose entire loyalty is dedicated to the cause of a emancipation of the people.

631
00:48:04.76 --> 00:48:07.20
Officers should have the following qualities.

632
00:48:07.20 --> 00:48:12.92
Great powers of endurance that in spite of any hardship he sets an example to his men

633
00:48:12.92 --> 00:48:15.28
and is a model for them.

634
00:48:15.28 --> 00:48:18.08
He must be able to mix easily with the people.

635
00:48:18.08 --> 00:48:23.72
His spirit and that of the men must be one in strengthening the policy of resistance to

636
00:48:23.72 --> 00:48:25.80
the Japanese.

637
00:48:25.80 --> 00:48:31.04
If he wishes to gain victories, he must study tactics.

638
00:48:31.04 --> 00:48:37.32
A guerrilla group with officers of this caliber would be unbeatable.

639
00:48:37.32 --> 00:48:43.56
Again, a massive focus on the leadership.

640
00:48:43.56 --> 00:48:49.32
Setting an example leading from the front and also being able to communicate with people.

641
00:48:49.32 --> 00:48:56.36
Being able to get down there with the troops and have them relate to you, Mau Ngu, this

642
00:48:56.36 --> 00:48:59.88
was important.

643
00:48:59.88 --> 00:49:01.84
And a little bit about the troopers here.

644
00:49:01.84 --> 00:49:07.80
A soldier who habitually breaks regulations must be dismissed from the army.

645
00:49:07.80 --> 00:49:13.12
Vagabans and vicious people must not be accepted for service.

646
00:49:13.12 --> 00:49:16.76
The opium habit must be forbidden.

647
00:49:16.76 --> 00:49:23.000
In a soldier who cannot break himself of the habit should be dismissed.

648
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:30.92
Victory in guerrilla war is conditioned upon keeping the membership pure and clean.

649
00:49:30.92 --> 00:49:34.12
You got to have good troopers.

650
00:49:34.12 --> 00:49:38.36
The idea must be an ever-present conviction.

651
00:49:38.36 --> 00:49:43.76
And if it is forgotten, we may succumb to the temptations of the enemy or be overcome with

652
00:49:43.76 --> 00:49:47.44
discouragements.

653
00:49:47.44 --> 00:49:49.12
Here we talk about this is commanders intent.

654
00:49:49.12 --> 00:49:51.68
This is understand why you're doing what you're doing.

655
00:49:51.68 --> 00:49:52.68
This is task and purposes.

656
00:49:52.68 --> 00:49:54.52
This is a whole bunch of things wrapped up.

657
00:49:54.52 --> 00:49:55.92
This is how Mau says it.

658
00:49:55.92 --> 00:49:59.72
I say people got to understand why they're doing what they're doing.

659
00:49:59.72 --> 00:50:01.96
And Mau knew the same thing.

660
00:50:01.96 --> 00:50:02.96
Here's what he said.

661
00:50:02.96 --> 00:50:09.84
In a war of long duration, those who's conviction that the people must be emancipated

662
00:50:09.84 --> 00:50:16.08
is not deep or likely to become shaken in their faith or actually revolt.

663
00:50:16.08 --> 00:50:26.28
Without the general education that enables everyone to understand our goal.

664
00:50:26.28 --> 00:50:29.28
If anyone's sleeping right now, wake up and listen to this.

665
00:50:29.28 --> 00:50:36.28
Without the general education that enables everyone to understand our goal.

666
00:50:36.28 --> 00:50:43.64
The soldiers fight without conviction and lose their determination.

667
00:50:43.64 --> 00:50:48.000
Your people, if you're in a leadership position, have got to understand why they're doing

668
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.80
what they're doing.

669
00:50:49.80 --> 00:50:51.52
They have to.

670
00:50:51.52 --> 00:50:56.80
Or they fight without conviction and lose their determination.

671
00:50:56.80 --> 00:51:02.96
Again, this is just...

672
00:51:02.96 --> 00:51:11.24
It's unbelievable that Mau had this vision and didn't apply it to everything.

673
00:51:11.24 --> 00:51:13.64
Listen to what he says about discipline.

674
00:51:13.64 --> 00:51:22.24
A revolutionary army must have discipline that is established on a limited democratic basis.

675
00:51:22.24 --> 00:51:27.44
In all armies, obedience of the subordinates to their superiors must be exacted.

676
00:51:27.44 --> 00:51:32.56
This is true in the case of guerrilla discipline, but the basis for guerrilla discipline must

677
00:51:32.56 --> 00:51:37.04
be the individual conscience.

678
00:51:37.04 --> 00:51:45.32
With guerrillas, a discipline of compulsion is ineffective.

679
00:51:45.32 --> 00:51:47.88
A discipline of compulsion is ineffective.

680
00:51:47.88 --> 00:51:52.80
So if I'm yelling at you and I'm making you do stiff, if I just force you to do things,

681
00:51:52.80 --> 00:51:56.68
I force discipline on you, that is ineffective.

682
00:51:56.68 --> 00:51:59.24
Thank you, Mau.

683
00:51:59.24 --> 00:52:01.68
In pose, discipline.

684
00:52:01.68 --> 00:52:02.68
Versus self-discipline.

685
00:52:02.68 --> 00:52:06.56
Yes, this is a familiar term, right?

686
00:52:06.56 --> 00:52:12.34
In any revolutionary army, there is unity of purpose as far as both officers and men are

687
00:52:12.34 --> 00:52:13.34
concerned.

688
00:52:13.34 --> 00:52:19.60
Therefore, within such an army, discipline is self-imposed.

689
00:52:19.60 --> 00:52:24.24
Although discipline and guerrilla ranks is not a severe as in the ranks of orthodox forces,

690
00:52:24.24 --> 00:52:27.88
the necessity for discipline exists.

691
00:52:27.88 --> 00:52:36.40
This must be self-imposed, because only when it is, is the soldier able to understand completely

692
00:52:36.40 --> 00:52:42.28
why he fights and why he must obey.

693
00:52:42.28 --> 00:52:49.80
This type of discipline becomes a tower of strength within the army, and it is the only

694
00:52:49.80 --> 00:52:56.20
type that can truly harmonize the relationship that exists between officers and soldiers.

695
00:52:56.20 --> 00:53:00.76
It's unbelievable.

696
00:53:00.76 --> 00:53:02.36
It's unbelievable.

697
00:53:02.36 --> 00:53:10.000
This is completely true, and it's true across the board in any organization.

698
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.88
That what, when you get this, when everyone understands why they're doing it, that becomes

699
00:53:15.88 --> 00:53:22.16
the strength and people discipline themselves, because they understand why.

700
00:53:22.16 --> 00:53:26.48
And he says that that type of discipline, I have to read the second, this type of discipline

701
00:53:26.48 --> 00:53:33.64
becomes a tower of strength within the army, and it is the only type that can truly harmonize

702
00:53:33.64 --> 00:53:41.92
the relationship that exists between officers and soldiers.

703
00:53:41.92 --> 00:53:49.76
And he goes on to say this, in any system where discipline is externally imposed, the relationship

704
00:53:49.76 --> 00:53:57.48
that exists between officer and man is characterized by indifference of the one to the other.

705
00:53:57.48 --> 00:54:02.68
The idea that officers can physically beat or severely tongue-lash their men is a feudal

706
00:54:02.68 --> 00:54:09.40
one and is not in accord with the conception of self-imposed discipline.

707
00:54:09.40 --> 00:54:15.88
Discipline of the feudal type will destroy internal unity and fighting strength.

708
00:54:15.88 --> 00:54:24.64
The discipline self-imposed is the primary characteristic of a democratic system in the army.

709
00:54:24.64 --> 00:54:31.56
Unbelievable that he wrote these words and ran his nation the way he did.

710
00:54:31.56 --> 00:54:32.56
It's unbelievable.

711
00:54:32.56 --> 00:54:37.08
As a matter of fact, I hope some revolutionaries over there are listening to me and saying,

712
00:54:37.08 --> 00:54:38.08
you know what?

713
00:54:38.08 --> 00:54:39.32
I think we missed the mark a little bit.

714
00:54:39.32 --> 00:54:46.32
How did that mean that? Now didn't want us to beat and torture people to get them in line?

715
00:54:46.32 --> 00:54:51.32
I could go back against them with Mao's own words.

716
00:54:51.32 --> 00:54:54.72
Let's go toe to toe.

717
00:54:54.72 --> 00:54:58.32
Get some freedom.

718
00:54:58.32 --> 00:55:04.96
Further, in such an army, the mode of living, the mode of living of the officers and soldiers

719
00:55:04.96 --> 00:55:10.16
must not differ too much and this is particularly true in the case of guerrilla troops.

720
00:55:10.16 --> 00:55:13.80
Officers should live under the same conditions as their men.

721
00:55:13.80 --> 00:55:17.68
For that is the only way in which they can gain from their men the admiration and confidence

722
00:55:17.68 --> 00:55:19.08
so vital in war.

723
00:55:19.08 --> 00:55:20.88
The same thing we heard from everywhere.

724
00:55:20.88 --> 00:55:22.72
We heard that from Patton.

725
00:55:22.72 --> 00:55:26.28
So Patton and Mao were on the same page.

726
00:55:26.28 --> 00:55:31.60
It is incorrect to hold to a theory of equality and all things but there must be equality

727
00:55:31.60 --> 00:55:35.84
of existence and accepting the hardships and dangers of war.

728
00:55:35.84 --> 00:55:40.28
Thus we may attain to the unification of the officer and soldier groups a unity both

729
00:55:40.28 --> 00:55:45.52
horizontal within the group itself and vertical.

730
00:55:45.52 --> 00:55:49.84
That is from the lower to the higher echelons.

731
00:55:49.84 --> 00:55:56.28
It is only when such unity is present that units can be said to be powerful combat factors.

732
00:55:56.28 --> 00:56:03.88
Back to some tactical notes, speed is essential.

733
00:56:03.88 --> 00:56:09.80
The movements of guerrilla troops must be secret and of supernatural rapidity.

734
00:56:09.80 --> 00:56:16.36
The enemy must be taken unaware and the action entered speedily.

735
00:56:16.36 --> 00:56:22.88
There can be no procrastination in the execution of plans.

736
00:56:22.88 --> 00:56:27.84
We have to get it done here and now.

737
00:56:27.84 --> 00:56:33.60
The enemy is much stronger than we are and it is true that we can hinder, distract,

738
00:56:33.60 --> 00:56:38.84
disperse and destroy him only if we disperse our own forces.

739
00:56:38.84 --> 00:56:43.72
Although guerrilla warfare is the warfare of such dispersed units, it is sometimes desirable

740
00:56:43.72 --> 00:56:47.32
to concentrate in order to destroy an enemy.

741
00:56:47.32 --> 00:56:52.44
Thus the principle of concentration of force against a relatively weaker enemy is applicable

742
00:56:52.44 --> 00:56:54.44
to guerrilla warfare.

743
00:56:54.44 --> 00:56:58.76
A little bit of prioritize next Q.

744
00:56:58.76 --> 00:57:08.48
And this right here is where we are going to close it out again going back to leadership.

745
00:57:08.48 --> 00:57:15.40
No military leader is endowed by heaven with an ability to seize the initiative.

746
00:57:15.40 --> 00:57:20.36
It is the intelligent leader who does so after a careful study and estimate of the situation

747
00:57:20.36 --> 00:57:24.72
and a range of the military and political factors involved.

748
00:57:24.72 --> 00:57:28.76
When a guerrilla unit, through either a poor estimate on the part of its leader or

749
00:57:28.76 --> 00:57:33.64
pressure from the enemy is forced into a passive position, it is first duty as to extricate

750
00:57:33.64 --> 00:57:35.68
itself.

751
00:57:35.68 --> 00:57:41.52
No method can be prescribed for this as the method to be employed will in every case

752
00:57:41.52 --> 00:57:44.12
depend on the situation.

753
00:57:44.12 --> 00:57:47.68
One can, if necessary, run away.

754
00:57:47.68 --> 00:57:53.68
But there are times when the situation seems hopeless and reality is not so at all.

755
00:57:53.68 --> 00:57:59.20
It is at such times when the good leader recognizes and ceases the moment when he can attain

756
00:57:59.20 --> 00:58:03.56
and regain the lost initiative.

757
00:58:03.56 --> 00:58:06.12
Let us revert to alertness.

758
00:58:06.12 --> 00:58:12.32
To conduct one's troops with alertness is essential of guerrilla command.

759
00:58:12.32 --> 00:58:18.52
Leaders must realize that to operate alertly is the most important factor in gaining the

760
00:58:18.52 --> 00:58:24.44
initiative and vital in its effect on the relative situation that exists between our forces

761
00:58:24.44 --> 00:58:26.44
and those of the enemy.

762
00:58:26.44 --> 00:58:30.72
guerrilla commanders must adjust their operations to enemy situation to the terrain and

763
00:58:30.72 --> 00:58:33.000
to prevailing local conditions.

764
00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.64
Leaders must be alert to sense changes in those factors and make necessary modifications

765
00:58:37.64 --> 00:58:42.16
in troop dispositions to accord with them.

766
00:58:42.16 --> 00:58:43.16
What are we talking about here?

767
00:58:43.16 --> 00:58:47.04
We're talking about you got to have the ability to detach.

768
00:58:47.04 --> 00:58:50.72
He's called it be alert.

769
00:58:50.72 --> 00:58:56.88
The leader must be like a fisherman who with his nets is able to both cast them and pull

770
00:58:56.88 --> 00:59:01.32
them out in awareness of the depth of the water, the strength of the current or the presence

771
00:59:01.32 --> 00:59:04.16
of any obstructions that may fall them.

772
00:59:04.16 --> 00:59:09.08
As the fisherman controls his nets through the lead robes, so the guerrilla leader maintains

773
00:59:09.08 --> 00:59:13.56
contact with and control over his units.

774
00:59:13.56 --> 00:59:18.68
As the fisherman must change position, so must the guerrilla commander.

775
00:59:18.68 --> 00:59:24.52
Disperption, concentration, constant change of position, it is in these ways that guerrillas

776
00:59:24.52 --> 00:59:26.96
employ their strength.

777
00:59:26.96 --> 00:59:30.76
And so you'll notice again what he's talking about is that the leader has to be able

778
00:59:30.76 --> 00:59:34.08
to detach and be alert of these things that are happening.

779
00:59:34.08 --> 00:59:38.92
And also you'll notice that throughout this, he puts total responsibility on the leader

780
00:59:38.92 --> 00:59:42.20
if the leader does well, the troops will do well.

781
00:59:42.20 --> 00:59:45.000
If the leader fails, they all fail.

782
00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:51.88
Talking about extreme ownership, this communist.

783
00:59:51.88 --> 01:00:08.32
So I thought that's a great eye into another leader that, you know, he led troops in combat.

784
01:00:08.32 --> 01:00:15.16
And like I said throughout that section, he just didn't realize that that is not just

785
01:00:15.16 --> 01:00:17.84
leadership for guerrilla unit.

786
01:00:17.84 --> 01:00:24.44
He thought that it was another way when different situations, but it's not good evening

787
01:00:24.44 --> 01:00:25.44
echo.

788
01:00:25.44 --> 01:00:26.44
Good evening.

789
01:00:26.44 --> 01:00:27.44
Welcome to the show.

790
01:00:27.44 --> 01:00:31.44
Thank you.

791
01:00:31.44 --> 01:00:39.92
No, and I think it's also good for me, diving into this other book here, you know, know

792
01:00:39.92 --> 01:00:43.36
where you're going to gain knowledge from, or confirm knowledge.

793
01:00:43.36 --> 01:00:44.36
Yeah.

794
01:00:44.36 --> 01:00:48.60
Is it going to be from, you know, one of the most murderous communist dictators of all

795
01:00:48.60 --> 01:00:49.60
time?

796
01:00:49.60 --> 01:00:52.60
Yes, I'm getting some knowledge from them, confirming knowledge.

797
01:00:52.60 --> 01:00:54.000
And that's pretty cool.

798
01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:06.88
And it also proves once again, once again, that leading people is leading people, whether

799
01:01:06.88 --> 01:01:10.84
you're doing it combat, whether you're doing a business, whether you're doing it in a team,

800
01:01:10.84 --> 01:01:15.88
leadership, the leadership principles that work with humans work with all humans in all

801
01:01:15.88 --> 01:01:16.88
situations.

802
01:01:16.88 --> 01:01:17.88
Are there nuances?

803
01:01:17.88 --> 01:01:18.88
Yes.

804
01:01:18.88 --> 01:01:20.24
Do you have to make adjustments?

805
01:01:20.24 --> 01:01:22.32
Yes, that's actually what we just talked about.

806
01:01:22.32 --> 01:01:23.32
Yeah.

807
01:01:23.32 --> 01:01:28.16
That is being alert enough or detached enough that you can sense those things.

808
01:01:28.16 --> 01:01:30.36
And you can make those adjustments on the fly.

809
01:01:30.36 --> 01:01:32.88
But the basic principles, they don't change.

810
01:01:32.88 --> 01:01:36.84
And they haven't changed for thousands of years.

811
01:01:36.84 --> 01:01:43.40
So yeah, let's get to some internet questions.

812
01:01:43.40 --> 01:01:44.40
Sure.

813
01:01:44.40 --> 01:01:45.40
How's that?

814
01:01:45.40 --> 01:01:48.52
Sounds good to me.

815
01:01:48.52 --> 01:01:55.52
But before that, internet related items, other than the questions are the fact that we're

816
01:01:55.52 --> 01:01:56.72
sponsored by on it.

817
01:01:56.72 --> 01:01:59.32
.com boom.

818
01:01:59.32 --> 01:02:04.92
And that's where we get our supplements, including, but not limited to alpha brain, which

819
01:02:04.92 --> 01:02:08.12
helps you think better in your memory and stuff.

820
01:02:08.12 --> 01:02:09.12
It's good.

821
01:02:09.12 --> 01:02:13.68
And I'll tell you, they just release something called MCT oil.

822
01:02:13.68 --> 01:02:18.28
And if you're a type of person that's firing up the ketogenic diet and you're going

823
01:02:18.28 --> 01:02:22.48
to load a low carb like I do, then you can try this stuff out.

824
01:02:22.48 --> 01:02:26.32
I've been putting it in directly into heavy whipping cream.

825
01:02:26.32 --> 01:02:30.04
I put a little MCT coconut MCT oil or strawberry cream.

826
01:02:30.04 --> 01:02:31.04
Right in there.

827
01:02:31.04 --> 01:02:32.04
Stir it.

828
01:02:32.04 --> 01:02:34.24
You've got yourself a little treat.

829
01:02:34.24 --> 01:02:36.40
You've got yourself a little treat.

830
01:02:36.40 --> 01:02:37.88
So good to go.

831
01:02:37.88 --> 01:02:38.88
Zero carbs.

832
01:02:38.88 --> 01:02:42.92
All fat just flowing through my system.

833
01:02:42.92 --> 01:02:44.32
Loving it on it.

834
01:02:44.32 --> 01:02:45.32
This is my third.

835
01:02:45.32 --> 01:02:47.32
Miles on Jockel's feet.

836
01:02:47.32 --> 01:02:48.16
Yes.

837
01:02:48.16 --> 01:02:49.16
Give that stuff a shout.

838
01:02:49.16 --> 01:02:50.16
I'll tell you.

839
01:02:50.16 --> 01:02:51.96
I'll tell you some curl oil on top of it.

840
01:02:51.96 --> 01:02:54.56
Yeah, keep your joints intact.

841
01:02:54.56 --> 01:02:57.76
Even if you're young, I think you should have curl oil.

842
01:02:57.76 --> 01:03:00.36
If you're training, yeah.

843
01:03:00.36 --> 01:03:04.40
If you're listening to this podcast and you're getting after it, yeah, let's grow oil.

844
01:03:04.40 --> 01:03:06.40
That's the deal.

845
01:03:06.40 --> 01:03:10.08

Because retail, full of paying 100%.

847
01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.24
I'm not saying that's bad.

848
01:03:14.24 --> 01:03:15.24
I'm not saying that.

849
01:03:15.24 --> 01:03:17.84
But 10% off let's face it.

850
01:03:17.84 --> 01:03:18.84
10% off.

851
01:03:18.84 --> 01:03:22.000
Yeah, on it.com slash Jockel.

852
01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:28.88
Also, if you're in the mood to support this podcast for any reason, you can do a few things.

853
01:03:28.88 --> 01:03:29.88
And they're really easy.

854
01:03:29.88 --> 01:03:35.76
So one of them is before you shop on Amazon, no matter what you're buying, including

855
01:03:35.76 --> 01:03:40.36
but not limited to any of the books at Jockel reviews or extra ownership of the book

856
01:03:40.36 --> 01:03:42.000
Jockel Road.

857
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.52
Go to jockelpodcast.com first.

858
01:03:44.52 --> 01:03:46.40
Click on the Amazon link.

859
01:03:46.40 --> 01:03:52.04
And then it kind of gives us a little like a small briefer of fee.

860
01:03:52.04 --> 01:03:54.32
That's what it's called the briefer of fee.

861
01:03:54.32 --> 01:03:55.32
Nice.

862
01:03:55.32 --> 01:03:56.32
Easy way to support.

863
01:03:56.32 --> 01:04:02.52
Or if you like the shirt to that that we make, you want to wear one or two by one of those.

864
01:04:02.52 --> 01:04:03.52
Boom.

865
01:04:03.52 --> 01:04:04.52
There you go.

866
01:04:04.52 --> 01:04:08.48
If you want to donate, you can do that too.

867
01:04:08.48 --> 01:04:11.04
But why not get a shirt, right?

868
01:04:11.04 --> 01:04:12.04
Or a bumper sticker.

869
01:04:12.04 --> 01:04:14.16
Yeah, I forget to give up 30 bucks.

870
01:04:14.16 --> 01:04:16.16
Might as well get a t-shirt.

871
01:04:16.16 --> 01:04:17.16
It's true.

872
01:04:17.16 --> 01:04:18.16
Awesome.

873
01:04:18.16 --> 01:04:20.28
Let's answer some questions from the people.

874
01:04:20.28 --> 01:04:21.28
Cool.

875
01:04:21.28 --> 01:04:22.28
All right.

876
01:04:22.28 --> 01:04:25.28
First question.

877
01:04:25.28 --> 01:04:28.28
Jockel and Echo.

878
01:04:28.28 --> 01:04:32.16
Jiu Jitsu is a long, repetitive grind.

879
01:04:32.16 --> 01:04:36.56
That said, there are occasional highlights.

880
01:04:36.56 --> 01:04:37.56
Aha moments.

881
01:04:37.56 --> 01:04:39.08
Submissions you're proud of.

882
01:04:39.08 --> 01:04:41.52
Your personal legends, quote unquote.

883
01:04:41.52 --> 01:04:42.92
Or maybe key embarrassment.

884
01:04:42.92 --> 01:04:45.84
What are some of those for each of you?

885
01:04:45.84 --> 01:04:50.68
So, what is an aha moment?

886
01:04:50.68 --> 01:04:53.32
That's when you learn something really important in my opinion.

887
01:04:53.32 --> 01:04:54.32
Right.

888
01:04:54.32 --> 01:04:57.44
Now, the first part of this word says BJJ is a long, repetitive grind.

889
01:04:57.44 --> 01:04:59.08
No, I don't think so.

890
01:04:59.08 --> 01:05:00.08
I agree.

891
01:05:00.08 --> 01:05:01.08
disagree.

892
01:05:01.08 --> 01:05:02.08
I disagree with that.

893
01:05:02.08 --> 01:05:08.40
To me, BJJ is a fun, exciting road of enlightenment.

894
01:05:08.40 --> 01:05:09.40
That's a no.

895
01:05:09.40 --> 01:05:10.40
That's a no.

896
01:05:10.40 --> 01:05:11.40
Yeah.

897
01:05:11.40 --> 01:05:12.40
That's a no.

898
01:05:12.40 --> 01:05:13.40
Oh, there are some rough days on the match.

899
01:05:13.40 --> 01:05:14.40
Yeah.

900
01:05:14.40 --> 01:05:15.40
There's some rough days on that.

901
01:05:15.40 --> 01:05:18.60
No doubt about that.

902
01:05:18.60 --> 01:05:20.04
A couple for me.

903
01:05:20.04 --> 01:05:22.32
Well, one of them for sure.

904
01:05:22.32 --> 01:05:26.000
I've told the story before about how I started training Jiu Jitsu, a tilting mastery

905
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.12
of guy named Steve Bailey, awesome guy.

906
01:05:28.12 --> 01:05:30.88
Wasn't fighter, fought Moitai.

907
01:05:30.88 --> 01:05:34.000
And he was training with the graces in the early 90s.

908
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.16
Late 80s.

909
01:05:35.16 --> 01:05:37.96
He was training up in the garage in torrents.

910
01:05:37.96 --> 01:05:39.48
And so he knew Jiu Jitsu.

911
01:05:39.48 --> 01:05:43.04
And he asked a bunch of us that we want to train.

912
01:05:43.04 --> 01:05:45.32
A couple of us said, yes.

913
01:05:45.32 --> 01:05:46.16
He choked us out.

914
01:05:46.16 --> 01:05:47.16
He arm walked us.

915
01:05:47.16 --> 01:05:49.48
I was amazed.

916
01:05:49.48 --> 01:05:50.80
And I thought that that was all of Jiu Jitsu.

917
01:05:50.80 --> 01:05:52.36
And he was like literally a white belt.

918
01:05:52.36 --> 01:05:57.64
But 1990 or whatever, pre UFC, it was a big deal.

919
01:05:57.64 --> 01:06:00.80
Sonya is to tell the story quickly.

920
01:06:00.80 --> 01:06:04.04
One of the guys that was with me in that initial training

921
01:06:04.04 --> 01:06:05.28
is a guy named Jeff Higgs.

922
01:06:05.28 --> 01:06:06.28
Jeff.

923
01:06:06.28 --> 01:06:08.32
Higgs was a seal buddy.

924
01:06:08.32 --> 01:06:11.16
He might have went through seal training with an awesome guy.

925
01:06:11.16 --> 01:06:13.72
And we both were kind of training together at that time.

926
01:06:13.72 --> 01:06:16.92
We trained for like four or five months tops.

927
01:06:16.92 --> 01:06:18.64
And then we weren't in the same platoon.

928
01:06:18.64 --> 01:06:25.12
We came back and Higgs actually started training with Fabio Santos

929
01:06:25.12 --> 01:06:26.56
all the time.

930
01:06:26.56 --> 01:06:29.48
And he'd got out of the Navy just to train Jiu Jitsu.

931
01:06:29.48 --> 01:06:30.48
Yeah.

932
01:06:30.48 --> 01:06:31.64
And I was still in the seal team.

933
01:06:31.64 --> 01:06:33.64
He was going on a plundering blah blah blah.

934
01:06:33.64 --> 01:06:34.84
So one day he comes over to my house.

935
01:06:34.84 --> 01:06:38.04
He had just gotten his purple belt.

936
01:06:38.04 --> 01:06:39.48
And I was a white belt.

937
01:06:39.48 --> 01:06:41.60
And he goes, hey, you want to train?

938
01:06:41.60 --> 01:06:42.60
And I said, yeah.

939
01:06:42.60 --> 01:06:45.08
I mean, I thought, you know, I know the stuff that he knows.

940
01:06:45.08 --> 01:06:48.20
Because I learned it three years ago or four years ago or

941
01:06:48.20 --> 01:06:49.56
whatever it was.

942
01:06:49.56 --> 01:06:51.56
Yeah, let's do it.

943
01:06:51.56 --> 01:06:55.08
So we went across the street into the grass and just he just

944
01:06:55.08 --> 01:06:55.72
choked me.

945
01:06:55.72 --> 01:06:57.48
I mean, just destroyed me, right?

946
01:06:57.48 --> 01:07:01.12
Brand new purple belt showing off his skills on my neck.

947
01:07:01.12 --> 01:07:02.12
He got to do it.

948
01:07:02.12 --> 01:07:03.80
He got to show off his skills.

949
01:07:03.80 --> 01:07:05.56
And Higgs is actually an awesome guy.

950
01:07:05.56 --> 01:07:06.56
Super humble.

951
01:07:06.56 --> 01:07:09.84
And he was actually the, you know, he was doing me a huge favor.

952
01:07:09.84 --> 01:07:12.56
You know, showing me that, hey, you don't know anything.

953
01:07:12.56 --> 01:07:15.68
And so that was that was an aha moment.

954
01:07:15.68 --> 01:07:18.000
I don't know anything.

955
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:24.20
So that was a, that was a good aha moment for me.

956
01:07:24.20 --> 01:07:28.56
Yeah, my name is way more, it was a lot shorter.

957
01:07:28.56 --> 01:07:33.48
So me and, me and Keknot, maybe seal one of my best friends.

958
01:07:33.48 --> 01:07:37.44
We went down to, remember when Dean had that spot,

959
01:07:37.44 --> 01:07:39.08
that it was like half a spot.

960
01:07:39.08 --> 01:07:39.28
Yep.

961
01:07:39.28 --> 01:07:40.28
Yep.

962
01:07:40.28 --> 01:07:44.08
So that's where I first, this was like maybe a month in.

963
01:07:44.08 --> 01:07:48.08
And I knew I went in knowing what mount in guard,

964
01:07:49.28 --> 01:07:52.08
side mount, rear naked choke, I knew that.

965
01:07:52.08 --> 01:07:55.32
I didn't know how to really function in any of those positions,

966
01:07:55.32 --> 01:07:56.56
but I knew what they were.

967
01:07:56.56 --> 01:07:58.04
And I knew how to be in a lot of stuff.

968
01:07:58.04 --> 01:07:59.48
So that was it.

969
01:07:59.48 --> 01:08:01.000
I thought it was a pretty solid athlete.

970
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.72
I was like, 225 solid.

971
01:08:03.72 --> 01:08:05.60
Was it your first time training with Dean?

972
01:08:05.60 --> 01:08:08.32
Yeah, this is my first time actually rolling with Dean.

973
01:08:08.32 --> 01:08:11.60
But he was, he was teacher, you know, like a small group of.

974
01:08:11.60 --> 01:08:14.32
And so I was like, oh shoot, I'm, you know, Dean,

975
01:08:14.32 --> 01:08:19.32
that was when in his height, when he was coming off his ADCC,

976
01:08:19.32 --> 01:08:23.56
when he had a super fight that year against John Jack.

977
01:08:23.56 --> 01:08:24.56
Yeah.

978
01:08:24.56 --> 01:08:26.96
So he was the man, you know.

979
01:08:26.96 --> 01:08:28.84
So I was like, well, I'm gonna roll with Dean,

980
01:08:28.84 --> 01:08:30.96
but so I maybe outweigh them, but you know,

981
01:08:30.96 --> 01:08:33.04
I don't know, five, five pounds, whatever.

982
01:08:33.04 --> 01:08:34.76
But I was like, what if I, what if I get Dean,

983
01:08:34.76 --> 01:08:37.76
that'll be so awkward, you know, like, I got him in.

984
01:08:37.76 --> 01:08:42.08
You know, and then, you know, maybe I'm spasning catch a submission.

985
01:08:42.08 --> 01:08:45.40
I don't know, you know, who knows, it's possible, right?

986
01:08:45.40 --> 01:08:48.16
So I was, so it was me in kicknuts and Dean was like,

987
01:08:48.16 --> 01:08:49.12
how are all with you guys?

988
01:08:49.12 --> 01:08:52.32
You know, welcome to the Academy or whatever.

989
01:08:52.32 --> 01:08:55.04
And I'm so like, I had, so I roll in right on,

990
01:08:55.04 --> 01:08:57.64
you know how you kind of, we didn't start standing up.

991
01:08:57.64 --> 01:09:00.20
He kind of sat down and he just started slowly roll.

992
01:09:00.20 --> 01:09:01.68
He just key grabbed me.

993
01:09:01.68 --> 01:09:05.68
And now it's called when you lock up with someone, right?

994
01:09:05.68 --> 01:09:06.92
You understand that that's what it's called,

995
01:09:06.92 --> 01:09:09.28
but when we locked up when he grabbed me,

996
01:09:09.28 --> 01:09:12.52
that's the moment I realized, oh yeah, that, that probability

997
01:09:12.52 --> 01:09:15.92
of me catching him is literally at this point zero.

998
01:09:15.92 --> 01:09:16.76
Yeah, literally.

999
01:09:16.76 --> 01:09:18.60
Just right when he grabbed me, I was like, oh man,

1000
01:09:18.60 --> 01:09:21.92
just the way he was and it just, you didn't feel like

1001
01:09:21.92 --> 01:09:22.92
you could just do anything.

1002
01:09:22.92 --> 01:09:25.20
And then of course he beat me up and when he was on

1003
01:09:25.20 --> 01:09:26.76
a kicknuts rolled with him, remember that thing?

1004
01:09:26.76 --> 01:09:29.04
And he did it in AD, AD, CC, I think he got to just

1005
01:09:29.04 --> 01:09:32.16
solo when you can do a certain position.

1006
01:09:32.16 --> 01:09:34.84
He gets kind of under you and then he picks you up

1007
01:09:34.84 --> 01:09:37.16
and stands up and walks around with you.

1008
01:09:37.16 --> 01:09:40.32
So he did that to kicknuts and then when I rolled with him

1009
01:09:40.32 --> 01:09:41.68
again, he did that to me.

1010
01:09:41.68 --> 01:09:44.60
But with me, he grabbed me and he went, bam, bam,

1011
01:09:44.60 --> 01:09:46.000
I'm bash me against the wall.

1012
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.04
Not hard to play full.

1013
01:09:47.04 --> 01:09:51.48
Just to show me again that the chance of me actually

1014
01:09:51.48 --> 01:09:53.92
doing anything or having any control over this whole

1015
01:09:53.92 --> 01:09:56.44
experience was zero.

1016
01:09:56.44 --> 01:09:58.64
So that's that aha moment that I was like,

1017
01:09:58.64 --> 01:10:00.40
okay, this jujitsu thing is way more,

1018
01:10:00.40 --> 01:10:02.44
because I was bigger than him, I knew I could lift more

1019
01:10:02.44 --> 01:10:05.44
and I'm going to wait to him and know that at this point.

1020
01:10:05.44 --> 01:10:07.80
But it didn't matter at all.

1021
01:10:07.80 --> 01:10:10.36
So that's, yeah, that's when I realized that.

1022
01:10:10.36 --> 01:10:11.36
So I got to do that.

1023
01:10:11.36 --> 01:10:12.20
I got to go on.

1024
01:10:12.20 --> 01:10:16.80
So I was a white belt, a white belt,

1025
01:10:16.80 --> 01:10:18.56
but I was training.

1026
01:10:18.56 --> 01:10:21.80
So after Higgs comes my house, it destroys me.

1027
01:10:21.80 --> 01:10:22.92
I'm like, okay, I'll be there tomorrow,

1028
01:10:22.92 --> 01:10:23.92
give me the address.

1029
01:10:23.92 --> 01:10:26.04
I walk in, I'm like, hey, I wanna sign up for unlimited classes.

1030
01:10:26.04 --> 01:10:26.88
Do you wanna try a class?

1031
01:10:26.88 --> 01:10:28.000
No, I wanna sign up for the class.

1032
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:28.84
I'm gonna see now.

1033
01:10:28.84 --> 01:10:29.68
That fob you.

1034
01:10:29.68 --> 01:10:30.84
Yep, fob you.

1035
01:10:30.84 --> 01:10:33.000
So go in there, start training,

1036
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.48
and just I'm taking classes during lunch.

1037
01:10:35.48 --> 01:10:37.72
I drive down from team, go take a lunch class.

1038
01:10:37.72 --> 01:10:39.000
I would train with guys in the morning,

1039
01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.40
and I could get to train with all the training,

1040
01:10:40.40 --> 01:10:41.12
and then I'd come at night,

1041
01:10:41.12 --> 01:10:41.88
I'd take the beginner's class,

1042
01:10:41.88 --> 01:10:42.88
and I'd take the advanced class,

1043
01:10:42.88 --> 01:10:43.76
and then I'd do open mat,

1044
01:10:43.76 --> 01:10:46.000
and then fob you would kick,

1045
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.96
dean, and I off the mat.

1046
01:10:47.96 --> 01:10:50.48
At nine o'clock and tell us to get lies.

1047
01:10:50.48 --> 01:10:51.92
And so when he was almost training,

1048
01:10:51.92 --> 01:10:53.60
but I still a white belt, right?

1049
01:10:53.60 --> 01:10:56.80
So this guy shows up and it's another seal.

1050
01:10:56.80 --> 01:10:59.28
And I didn't know him, he was from the East Coast,

1051
01:10:59.28 --> 01:11:02.32
and I didn't know him, and he was strong,

1052
01:11:02.32 --> 01:11:04.52
and he was a blue belt, right?

1053
01:11:04.52 --> 01:11:06.52
So I go, okay, this guy's a blue belt, he's gonna be good.

1054
01:11:06.52 --> 01:11:08.92
Well, we had some wars, right?

1055
01:11:08.92 --> 01:11:10.32
There's our mobile, he's a blue belt,

1056
01:11:10.32 --> 01:11:11.88
but I'm training out in San Diego,

1057
01:11:11.88 --> 01:11:12.96
which has really good to get to,

1058
01:11:12.96 --> 01:11:15.24
obviously I'm training with dean,

1059
01:11:15.24 --> 01:11:16.52
through learning from fobio,

1060
01:11:16.52 --> 01:11:17.48
we're training all the time,

1061
01:11:17.48 --> 01:11:20.56
so I'm pretty good for a white belt, maybe.

1062
01:11:20.56 --> 01:11:21.92
So he and I are having a war,

1063
01:11:21.92 --> 01:11:23.80
and he's only in town for about a week,

1064
01:11:23.80 --> 01:11:26.84
or maybe a week and a half, two weeks at the most.

1065
01:11:26.84 --> 01:11:30.04
So a white belt war, white belt warriors.

1066
01:11:30.04 --> 01:11:35.04
So we're going stalemate, everyday stalemate, stalemate,

1067
01:11:35.04 --> 01:11:40.04
stalemate, the last day, the last day,

1068
01:11:40.04 --> 01:11:43.80
he gets mounted on me, and he was a wrestler in college,

1069
01:11:43.80 --> 01:11:46.80
college wrestler, and a very competitive guy

1070
01:11:46.80 --> 01:11:48.56
in a great guy, by the way.

1071
01:11:48.56 --> 01:11:51.40
The last day, he like knows he wants it,

1072
01:11:51.40 --> 01:11:56.40
he gets mounted on me, he digs in a choke,

1073
01:11:56.40 --> 01:11:58.56
a geek choke, like an ex-choke,

1074
01:11:58.56 --> 01:12:00.76
and just puts the pressure,

1075
01:12:00.76 --> 01:12:03.96
and smashing my face does in care,

1076
01:12:03.96 --> 01:12:07.36
and it gets into my neck, I tap.

1077
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.80
And that's that.

1078
01:12:11.80 --> 01:12:16.48
So this guy now, he goes back to East Coast,

1079
01:12:16.48 --> 01:12:17.92
we continue in our careers.

1080
01:12:17.92 --> 01:12:20.60
I'm now training even more,

1081
01:12:20.60 --> 01:12:23.32
I'm just training and training and training and training,

1082
01:12:23.32 --> 01:12:23.88
and I'm training with dean,

1083
01:12:23.88 --> 01:12:25.80
and I'm going to college when I went to college,

1084
01:12:25.80 --> 01:12:28.24
and I'm going to train even more,

1085
01:12:28.24 --> 01:12:31.24
and then finally, so I would see him occasionally.

1086
01:12:31.24 --> 01:12:32.60
And it's all you're still training, he goes,

1087
01:12:32.60 --> 01:12:34.24
yeah, you know what I'm still training, still training,

1088
01:12:34.24 --> 01:12:35.56
and any actually, completely,

1089
01:12:35.56 --> 01:12:37.36
will compete in the worlds, and did well in worlds,

1090
01:12:37.36 --> 01:12:39.000
as a purple belt, I think you actually won worlds,

1091
01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.60
as a purple belt, and eventually got a spround belt,

1092
01:12:43.60 --> 01:12:47.16
and so finally, like 10 years later.

1093
01:12:47.16 --> 01:12:51.64
So now, I mean, I literally deans main training partner

1094
01:12:51.64 --> 01:12:55.44
for something like 12 years at this point,

1095
01:12:55.44 --> 01:12:57.84
and like you said, this is when Dean's just dominating,

1096
01:12:57.84 --> 01:13:02.84
and so I'm going to a seal conference on this remote location,

1097
01:13:06.60 --> 01:13:09.12
and I look at the roster of who's gonna be there,

1098
01:13:09.12 --> 01:13:13.72
and he's gonna be there, and I went to a whole depot,

1099
01:13:13.72 --> 01:13:17.60
and I bought like a 30 by 30 canvas,

1100
01:13:19.56 --> 01:13:22.92
canvas, you know, tarp to put on the ground,

1101
01:13:22.92 --> 01:13:27.28
so I could train with him, and I send him an email,

1102
01:13:27.28 --> 01:13:28.60
I was like, hey, I see the trick on the conference,

1103
01:13:28.60 --> 01:13:30.40
let's train with him, he's like, absolutely,

1104
01:13:30.40 --> 01:13:33.32
look forward to it, I'm like, I do too,

1105
01:13:33.32 --> 01:13:37.12
and so we get out there, we fly to this place, we meet up,

1106
01:13:37.12 --> 01:13:39.24
and I say, let's train, and we get on the mat,

1107
01:13:39.24 --> 01:13:43.72
and I'm just, you know, like, a thousand times better

1108
01:13:43.72 --> 01:13:47.000
than I was, and again, at this point,

1109
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I've been training with Dean, I gone through a whole competition phase,

1110
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.36
so anyways, and he's been working,

1111
01:13:52.36 --> 01:13:54.20
and he's been deploying, and he's been being a seal,

1112
01:13:54.20 --> 01:13:59.04
so I mean, I just trained more, and I was just all over him,

1113
01:13:59.04 --> 01:14:01.80
and so I submitted him a bunch of times, and then,

1114
01:14:01.80 --> 01:14:04.72
and then, you know, he kind of said,

1115
01:14:04.72 --> 01:14:07.16
like, can you just show me some stuff?

1116
01:14:07.16 --> 01:14:09.28
You know, I was like, yeah, man, sorry.

1117
01:14:09.28 --> 01:14:11.64
For you, that was the victory, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1118
01:14:11.64 --> 01:14:14.36
but it was funny, and then I would always joke with him about it,

1119
01:14:14.36 --> 01:14:16.40
and I kind of tell that story, he was like,

1120
01:14:16.40 --> 01:14:20.68
almost, I put the spin on it as if I was thinking

1121
01:14:20.68 --> 01:14:22.32
about him the whole time, but it's not true.

1122
01:14:22.32 --> 01:14:26.04
I just, yeah, but, and then one time years later, I saw him,

1123
01:14:26.04 --> 01:14:30.84
and we were in, we were in DC, we actually at the Pentagon,

1124
01:14:30.84 --> 01:14:33.44
hadn't seen him for a year or two, and I see him,

1125
01:14:33.44 --> 01:14:36.32
and I'm in my, my khaki uniform, you know,

1126
01:14:36.32 --> 01:14:39.16
with short sleeves, and he's like, oh, you look in skin,

1127
01:14:39.16 --> 01:14:41.20
you lose weight, and I look back and when you said,

1128
01:14:41.20 --> 01:14:42.92
I'm just trying to get down to your weight class,

1129
01:14:42.92 --> 01:14:44.96
and make it more even next time.

1130
01:14:44.96 --> 01:14:49.08
He just laughs, but a great guy, great guy, great leader, great guy.

1131
01:14:49.08 --> 01:14:51.68
That's funny, that happens a lot of the time where you'll

1132
01:14:51.68 --> 01:14:54.48
develop just through whether it be this kind of thing where you trained,

1133
01:14:54.48 --> 01:14:56.04
and then they leave, and they come back kind of thing,

1134
01:14:56.04 --> 01:14:59.84
or someone who hangs around, you develop that little sense of competition.

1135
01:14:59.84 --> 01:15:02.28
Usually happens with a guy who's close to you,

1136
01:15:02.28 --> 01:15:05.80
you kind of starts with you, or maybe kind of you meet him,

1137
01:15:05.80 --> 01:15:09.48
and you're just, you get start off the relationship for lack of a better

1138
01:15:09.48 --> 01:15:13.60
than you start off at a similar level, you know,

1139
01:15:13.60 --> 01:15:16.68
and then you kind of develop this little competition,

1140
01:15:16.68 --> 01:15:18.12
like, the guy, you know.

1141
01:15:18.12 --> 01:15:20.64
Yeah, and you always, when you get off the bus,

1142
01:15:20.64 --> 01:15:22.24
when you get off the training bus,

1143
01:15:23.40 --> 01:15:26.44
you're gonna lose time, you know,

1144
01:15:26.44 --> 01:15:29.28
you're gonna get better, that's why you can't get off the bus.

1145
01:15:29.28 --> 01:15:31.04
You gotta stay on the bus at all costs,

1146
01:15:31.04 --> 01:15:32.28
you gotta stay on the training bus.

1147
01:15:32.28 --> 01:15:33.12
Yeah.

1148
01:15:33.12 --> 01:15:35.08
If you get off the bus completely,

1149
01:15:35.08 --> 01:15:36.88
people are gonna have to get the bus going away.

1150
01:15:36.88 --> 01:15:37.88
Right, yeah.

1151
01:15:37.88 --> 01:15:39.68
And if they're on the, if you're a little training buddy,

1152
01:15:39.68 --> 01:15:42.64
they'll have bus, yeah, yeah, very, very hard to get.

1153
01:15:42.64 --> 01:15:43.48
You're doing it.

1154
01:15:43.48 --> 01:15:46.68
But there's been a series of periods over time,

1155
01:15:46.68 --> 01:15:49.52
one of them that always deemed, and I talk about a lot,

1156
01:15:49.52 --> 01:15:53.84
is he was killing me for like three months

1157
01:15:53.84 --> 01:15:57.44
with the front head norm, just hammering me with it,

1158
01:15:57.44 --> 01:16:00.08
and just couldn't get out of it smashing me.

1159
01:16:00.08 --> 01:16:00.80
And then one day he goes,

1160
01:16:00.80 --> 01:16:02.24
oh, if you wanna get out of it, just do,

1161
01:16:02.24 --> 01:16:04.20
put your hand on the hip and switch your head to the other side.

1162
01:16:04.20 --> 01:16:05.04
Mm.

1163
01:16:06.56 --> 01:16:09.64
And I'm like, bro, I saw I try it on like seriously.

1164
01:16:09.64 --> 01:16:11.44
You didn't, it's been three months,

1165
01:16:11.44 --> 01:16:12.28
and you didn't show me that?

1166
01:16:12.28 --> 01:16:13.12
Yeah.

1167
01:16:14.12 --> 01:16:15.76
What's your deal, you know?

1168
01:16:15.76 --> 01:16:18.64
And, but it also showed me that that,

1169
01:16:19.72 --> 01:16:22.60
is sometimes what I remember from that,

1170
01:16:22.60 --> 01:16:26.56
is that sometimes these simple moves

1171
01:16:26.56 --> 01:16:29.16
are so effective, and they're so obvious.

1172
01:16:30.24 --> 01:16:35.04
And all you need is just to get that little bit of knowledge

1173
01:16:35.04 --> 01:16:37.32
to make you be able to escape this position

1174
01:16:37.32 --> 01:16:39.56
that I was held in for three months.

1175
01:16:39.56 --> 01:16:40.56
Yeah.

1176
01:16:40.56 --> 01:16:42.92
Yeah, I wouldn't call it a piece of knowledge.

1177
01:16:42.92 --> 01:16:44.76
But just, seemingly, I always like,

1178
01:16:44.76 --> 01:16:47.76
20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, they seem obvious.

1179
01:16:47.76 --> 01:16:50.60
Yes, you're right, but it's,

1180
01:16:50.60 --> 01:16:52.000
that's the beautiful thing about you.

1181
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:52.84
It's just to it.

1182
01:16:52.84 --> 01:16:54.000
Never know, it's the other thing.

1183
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.04
So why don't get off the bus

1184
01:16:55.04 --> 01:16:58.72
because you never know what day you're gonna learn that thing.

1185
01:16:58.72 --> 01:17:01.08
What minute, what training partner's gonna say,

1186
01:17:01.08 --> 01:17:02.68
hey, if you moved your hips right here,

1187
01:17:02.68 --> 01:17:04.24
you'd've tapped me.

1188
01:17:04.24 --> 01:17:05.08
Yeah.

1189
01:17:05.08 --> 01:17:06.24
Yeah.

1190
01:17:06.24 --> 01:17:08.04
Yeah, actually Dean taught me something

1191
01:17:08.04 --> 01:17:10.48
in that exact same scenario.

1192
01:17:10.48 --> 01:17:13.04
He didn't, he didn't hammer me with it.

1193
01:17:13.04 --> 01:17:15.76
And then teacher Timmy, he just was,

1194
01:17:15.76 --> 01:17:18.68
he noticed that I had an opportunity to do it.

1195
01:17:18.68 --> 01:17:19.64
It was just a small thing.

1196
01:17:19.64 --> 01:17:22.16
It's hard to explain without doing it,

1197
01:17:22.16 --> 01:17:23.16
but he did that.

1198
01:17:23.16 --> 01:17:24.24
But it was just a matter of,

1199
01:17:24.24 --> 01:17:25.92
instead of moving your hips the natural way

1200
01:17:25.92 --> 01:17:28.28
that you always wanted to do, you just twist them the other way

1201
01:17:28.28 --> 01:17:29.76
and it breaks a certain grip

1202
01:17:29.76 --> 01:17:31.36
that he can control you with.

1203
01:17:31.36 --> 01:17:33.64
But yeah, so true.

1204
01:17:33.64 --> 01:17:38.64
What about, like, you know, some embarrassment.

1205
01:17:38.64 --> 01:17:44.28
You think I don't know, I'm getting barriced on the map.

1206
01:17:44.28 --> 01:17:45.80
I mean, you get tapped out of happens.

1207
01:17:45.80 --> 01:17:46.64
Right.

1208
01:17:46.64 --> 01:17:47.48
Yeah.

1209
01:17:47.48 --> 01:17:48.48
I'm not embarrassed by it.

1210
01:17:48.48 --> 01:17:50.76
You know, even if you get caught,

1211
01:17:50.76 --> 01:17:51.76
I mean, just doesn't matter.

1212
01:17:51.76 --> 01:17:53.000
Why would you be embarrassed?

1213
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Yeah.

1214
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:54.84
Yeah.

1215
01:17:54.84 --> 01:17:55.92
And embarrassed, I think, is a strong term

1216
01:17:55.92 --> 01:17:56.76
because that's true.

1217
01:17:56.76 --> 01:17:59.60
I mean, I don't think I've ever been like embarrassed.

1218
01:17:59.60 --> 01:18:02.20
Like, oh, but I actually,

1219
01:18:02.20 --> 01:18:03.64
I think pretty much only with you,

1220
01:18:03.64 --> 01:18:05.88
where it's not embarrassing,

1221
01:18:05.88 --> 01:18:07.40
it's just like when I think back on it,

1222
01:18:07.40 --> 01:18:09.48
I'm like, man, I should have been maybe mentally tougher.

1223
01:18:09.48 --> 01:18:12.16
Remember when I like given to like a claustrophobia thing?

1224
01:18:12.16 --> 01:18:12.52
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1225
01:18:12.52 --> 01:18:13.64
But you were real good at it,

1226
01:18:13.64 --> 01:18:15.24
because I'd only catch it with you.

1227
01:18:15.24 --> 01:18:15.56
Yeah, yeah.

1228
01:18:15.56 --> 01:18:17.68
No, once I realized that weakness,

1229
01:18:17.68 --> 01:18:21.000
I acted like chairman now and just attacked the weakness

1230
01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.44
and would just smother your claustrophobia.

1231
01:18:23.44 --> 01:18:24.12
Yeah.

1232
01:18:24.12 --> 01:18:26.32
And there's a few times where I was like,

1233
01:18:26.32 --> 01:18:28.24
I admitted to myself that I was like,

1234
01:18:28.24 --> 01:18:30.76
I didn't want to deal with that at that time.

1235
01:18:30.76 --> 01:18:32.44
And I was like, mad at myself,

1236
01:18:32.44 --> 01:18:33.84
but I was never really embarrassed.

1237
01:18:33.84 --> 01:18:34.68
I know.

1238
01:18:34.68 --> 01:18:36.48
Next time we roll, I'm going to explore your

1239
01:18:36.48 --> 01:18:37.32
go, good.

1240
01:18:37.32 --> 01:18:39.56
Yeah, Brad, you tested it the other day,

1241
01:18:39.56 --> 01:18:42.000
because you have a thing and whatever do you,

1242
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.92
but you wear cotton shirts a lot of the time when you.

1243
01:18:44.92 --> 01:18:46.40
So after rolling for a while,

1244
01:18:46.40 --> 01:18:49.08
that cotton shirt is like a like me water boarded

1245
01:18:49.08 --> 01:18:50.72
in certain positions.

1246
01:18:50.72 --> 01:18:51.56
Yeah.

1247
01:18:51.56 --> 01:18:53.40
And you were waterboarding me the other day.

1248
01:18:53.40 --> 01:18:54.24
Yeah.

1249
01:18:54.24 --> 01:18:57.60
And but man, no, no, no factor, no vote.

1250
01:18:57.60 --> 01:18:59.48
Wasn't giving in to that one like that.

1251
01:18:59.48 --> 01:19:01.48
Chocolate podcast is helping out that guy.

1252
01:19:01.48 --> 01:19:04.36
This is due to Gabe and Gettin.

1253
01:19:04.36 --> 01:19:06.08
All right.

1254
01:19:06.08 --> 01:19:06.92
You good?

1255
01:19:06.92 --> 01:19:07.76
Yeah.

1256
01:19:07.76 --> 01:19:08.28
Yeah.

1257
01:19:08.28 --> 01:19:09.48
It's all in.

1258
01:19:09.48 --> 01:19:10.28
But I agree with you.

1259
01:19:10.28 --> 01:19:11.12
It's not a great thing.

1260
01:19:11.12 --> 01:19:12.44
So I don't think it's a daily guy.

1261
01:19:12.44 --> 01:19:13.88
And you're looking back to the question also

1262
01:19:13.88 --> 01:19:16.60
says, what submissions are you proud of?

1263
01:19:16.60 --> 01:19:17.28
Yeah.

1264
01:19:17.28 --> 01:19:19.32
Like again, that's sort of like the embarrassment thing.

1265
01:19:19.32 --> 01:19:20.16
Right?

1266
01:19:20.16 --> 01:19:21.48
You do a submission.

1267
01:19:21.48 --> 01:19:22.32
Yeah.

1268
01:19:22.32 --> 01:19:23.12
And even when I talk to people,

1269
01:19:23.12 --> 01:19:25.32
like, they say, I'm going to catch you one day.

1270
01:19:25.32 --> 01:19:26.16
Right.

1271
01:19:26.16 --> 01:19:27.08
And I go, good man, that's awesome.

1272
01:19:27.08 --> 01:19:27.44
Yeah.

1273
01:19:27.44 --> 01:19:29.20
Do you just two works if you use it on me?

1274
01:19:29.20 --> 01:19:29.80
It's going to work.

1275
01:19:29.80 --> 01:19:32.08
And I would, I will admit that that right there.

1276
01:19:32.08 --> 01:19:33.08
I'm going to catch you one day.

1277
01:19:33.08 --> 01:19:34.24
That's there.

1278
01:19:34.24 --> 01:19:37.60
But not teeny like legitimate or significant degree.

1279
01:19:37.60 --> 01:19:39.32
Because I'll tell you, I have that in my head about you.

1280
01:19:39.32 --> 01:19:40.60
I'll catch you one day.

1281
01:19:40.60 --> 01:19:42.40
And I know you have been, you're mine.

1282
01:19:42.40 --> 01:19:43.80
No, you won't.

1283
01:19:43.80 --> 01:19:46.12
And even if you were to tell me, no, I don't have that in my

1284
01:19:46.12 --> 01:19:46.64
estate.

1285
01:19:46.64 --> 01:19:47.64
I don't want to know.

1286
01:19:47.64 --> 01:19:49.32
I accept it.

1287
01:19:49.32 --> 01:19:51.000
You know, because here's the deal.

1288
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.32
If I just didn't want, if I didn't want you to ever catch me,

1289
01:19:54.32 --> 01:19:55.12
what would I do?

1290
01:19:55.12 --> 01:19:55.92
Wouldn't roll with you.

1291
01:19:55.92 --> 01:19:56.60
Right.

1292
01:19:56.60 --> 01:19:57.80
But I don't care.

1293
01:19:57.80 --> 01:19:58.64
You know what I mean?

1294
01:19:58.64 --> 01:20:00.32
I'm going to roll with you all the time.

1295
01:20:00.32 --> 01:20:00.84
Yeah.

1296
01:20:00.84 --> 01:20:02.20
Who ever steps on the map?

1297
01:20:02.20 --> 01:20:02.56
Yeah.

1298
01:20:02.56 --> 01:20:03.68
That's what's the worst case in the area.

1299
01:20:03.68 --> 01:20:04.68
You get tapped out.

1300
01:20:04.68 --> 01:20:05.68
I mean, take a little bit better.

1301
01:20:05.68 --> 01:20:06.68
Yeah.

1302
01:20:06.68 --> 01:20:07.68
Yeah.

1303
01:20:07.68 --> 01:20:09.60
And it kind of presents those opportunities to be like, okay, my

1304
01:20:09.60 --> 01:20:11.000
game's not all perfect.

1305
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.64
Because if you get to, you don't realize how many holes you have.

1306
01:20:13.64 --> 01:20:17.56
You know, when you're sitting there, sometimes you do make like a little mistake.

1307
01:20:17.56 --> 01:20:19.76
And this is a good life lesson, too.

1308
01:20:19.76 --> 01:20:24.64
Sometimes you make a little mistake with somebody and you're lacks with somebody.

1309
01:20:24.64 --> 01:20:26.68
And they get and they might catch you.

1310
01:20:26.68 --> 01:20:31.80
When when normally, if you went 100 times more, you didn't relax at that moment.

1311
01:20:31.80 --> 01:20:34.24
But you can't live in that world because you got to relax when you train.

1312
01:20:34.24 --> 01:20:37.84
Otherwise, you won't explore new positions and get put and compromise positions and

1313
01:20:37.84 --> 01:20:38.84
all that.

1314
01:20:38.84 --> 01:20:39.84
So yeah.

1315
01:20:39.84 --> 01:20:43.44
And again, it's not to any real significant degree.

1316
01:20:43.44 --> 01:20:50.92
It's more just like a fun kind of competition thing that you have with certain people.

1317
01:20:50.92 --> 01:20:53.28
And you're like, yeah, I'm going to tap that guy one day.

1318
01:20:53.28 --> 01:20:56.12
You know, you don't talk trash to him whenever that's out.

1319
01:20:56.12 --> 01:20:59.12
Unfortunately, I'm the victim of that attitude towards me.

1320
01:20:59.12 --> 01:21:00.12
Yeah, well, you have to.

1321
01:21:00.12 --> 01:21:01.12
I was watching too.

1322
01:21:01.12 --> 01:21:04.36
Yeah, the top two of our good guys rolled today.

1323
01:21:04.36 --> 01:21:06.08
They're only the other that laughing.

1324
01:21:06.08 --> 01:21:07.08
They're having a lot of laughing.

1325
01:21:07.08 --> 01:21:08.08
They're literally laughing.

1326
01:21:08.08 --> 01:21:10.08
They're like telling jokes to each other.

1327
01:21:10.08 --> 01:21:12.52
When it's my turn to go in them, it's a murder time.

1328
01:21:12.52 --> 01:21:13.52
They're bringing it.

1329
01:21:13.52 --> 01:21:14.52
They're smashing.

1330
01:21:14.52 --> 01:21:16.000
They're bringing it.

1331
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:22.48
And it was it was it was bones, bones, Joan, Justin Jones, who's an animal and strong and

1332
01:21:22.48 --> 01:21:23.48
good.

1333
01:21:23.48 --> 01:21:25.08
And it was Taylor.

1334
01:21:25.08 --> 01:21:27.16
Taylor and Taylor's just a complete beast.

1335
01:21:27.16 --> 01:21:28.32
But those guys are only each other.

1336
01:21:28.32 --> 01:21:30.48
It's all gave us a laugh.

1337
01:21:30.48 --> 01:21:32.64
And they come with me to bring in the heat.

1338
01:21:32.64 --> 01:21:33.92
Because you know what they're thinking?

1339
01:21:33.92 --> 01:21:35.16
Exactly what you just said.

1340
01:21:35.16 --> 01:21:36.92
Maybe they can get that tap.

1341
01:21:36.92 --> 01:21:38.92
Get it today.

1342
01:21:38.92 --> 01:21:44.72
It will be a grind though if you have this specific mindset, which can be common.

1343
01:21:44.72 --> 01:21:50.76
And sometimes you might go in and out of it where if your goals are predicated on something

1344
01:21:50.76 --> 01:21:54.80
outside of just learning, you just like sometimes people would be focused on the belt.

1345
01:21:54.80 --> 01:21:55.80
Oh, yeah.

1346
01:21:55.80 --> 01:21:57.72
I want to get my purple belt or whatever.

1347
01:21:57.72 --> 01:21:59.36
And when am I going to get that purple belt?

1348
01:21:59.36 --> 01:22:03.48
And then people tell you the answer really is if you want to answer that question, put

1349
01:22:03.48 --> 01:22:05.76
in the time, put in the work, learn all this stuff.

1350
01:22:05.76 --> 01:22:07.000
And one day it will come to you.

1351
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Yeah.

1352
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
So it's your goal.

1353
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.76
It's the same thing when I talk about people in there and their career.

1354
01:22:13.76 --> 01:22:15.08
They say I want to get promoted.

1355
01:22:15.08 --> 01:22:19.60
If you're in your career to get promoted, it's going to be a grind.

1356
01:22:19.60 --> 01:22:23.12
If you're in your career, you're trying to do a good job.

1357
01:22:23.12 --> 01:22:25.92
Like when I was in the military, I didn't care about promotion.

1358
01:22:25.92 --> 01:22:27.12
I was just trying to do a good job.

1359
01:22:27.12 --> 01:22:28.12
Don't you do a good job?

1360
01:22:28.12 --> 01:22:29.12
You'll get noticed.

1361
01:22:29.12 --> 01:22:31.88
At some point, and you'll get your promotion.

1362
01:22:31.88 --> 01:22:35.20
But if all your turn-doers get promoted, it's game and maneuver and all that stuff.

1363
01:22:35.20 --> 01:22:36.56
It's not going to be fun.

1364
01:22:36.56 --> 01:22:37.56
Yeah.

1365
01:22:37.56 --> 01:22:38.56
And it's whack.

1366
01:22:38.56 --> 01:22:42.16
And you see people, everyone, you can, one someone's doing that you can tell because they'll

1367
01:22:42.16 --> 01:22:43.16
be.

1368
01:22:43.16 --> 01:22:46.000
When the teachers around, they won't roll with good guys and get good work.

1369
01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.08
They'll just, you know, they'll do stuff with all the way to the only way.

1370
01:22:49.08 --> 01:22:52.04
Because they want to look good and demonstrate to the teacher, hey, look, I'm rolling

1371
01:22:52.04 --> 01:22:53.68
like a purple belt.

1372
01:22:53.68 --> 01:22:56.80
Give it to me, you know, so they have that kind of approach to it.

1373
01:22:56.80 --> 01:22:57.80
And it gets in your way.

1374
01:22:57.80 --> 01:22:59.000
And yeah, it will be a grind.

1375
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.44
Because you're going to be like, man, how many hours do I have to put into this thing?

1376
01:23:01.44 --> 01:23:04.24
Because your focus on when am I going to get the belt?

1377
01:23:04.24 --> 01:23:06.04
And you can fall in it out of that sometimes too.

1378
01:23:06.04 --> 01:23:09.000
It's very, because it kind of depends on your environment.

1379
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.64
If everyone's thinking like that, or if they're even vocal about it, you know, you can't

1380
01:23:12.64 --> 01:23:16.44
help the kind of maybe feel that and be like, maybe that's kind of the thing, you know?

1381
01:23:16.44 --> 01:23:18.16
Yeah, don't worry about your belt.

1382
01:23:18.16 --> 01:23:19.16
Yeah.

1383
01:23:19.16 --> 01:23:22.40
Man, I didn't even know that they're, because when I started, I was going with Dean,

1384
01:23:22.40 --> 01:23:24.12
so it was all nogie.

1385
01:23:24.12 --> 01:23:26.68
So I didn't really know really about belts.

1386
01:23:26.68 --> 01:23:27.68
And Jimmy, remember Jimmy?

1387
01:23:27.68 --> 01:23:28.68
Yeah.

1388
01:23:28.68 --> 01:23:30.60
Hey, come to class tomorrow.

1389
01:23:30.60 --> 01:23:32.32
We have promotions.

1390
01:23:32.32 --> 01:23:33.60
So be sure to come.

1391
01:23:33.60 --> 01:23:35.04
And I was like, oh, that's cool.

1392
01:23:35.04 --> 01:23:38.56
I thought he meant promotions like some brands were coming in to promote the products

1393
01:23:38.56 --> 01:23:39.56
and stuff.

1394
01:23:39.56 --> 01:23:40.56
So it would be a fun time.

1395
01:23:40.56 --> 01:23:41.20
So I was like, oh, yeah, that's cool.

1396
01:23:41.20 --> 01:23:43.44
He's like, yeah, so come like that.

1397
01:23:43.44 --> 01:23:44.44
And I'm like, yeah, all right.

1398
01:23:44.44 --> 01:23:45.60
So you got to my belt.

1399
01:23:45.60 --> 01:23:50.24
I said, why I said, I can't really make it because usually I work at night or whatever.

1400
01:23:50.24 --> 01:23:51.44
And he's like, no, no, he want to come.

1401
01:23:51.44 --> 01:23:54.72
And I was like, all right, I said it all try and something like, man, he's like, no, no,

1402
01:23:54.72 --> 01:23:55.72
you're getting promoted.

1403
01:23:55.72 --> 01:23:57.64
I was like, what does that mean?

1404
01:23:57.64 --> 01:23:59.04
I didn't say, what does that mean?

1405
01:23:59.04 --> 01:24:02.20
But I was like, I'm being, he's like, yeah, you're getting your blue belt.

1406
01:24:02.20 --> 01:24:04.44
And I was like, oh, yeah, I guess, right?

1407
01:24:04.44 --> 01:24:05.80
You get belts, right?

1408
01:24:05.80 --> 01:24:08.000
But I was just training and competing.

1409
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:13.000
And I think that that I learned like, I mean, I think as a white belt, if you're

1410
01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.92
into it, you learn the most.

1411
01:24:14.92 --> 01:24:15.76
You know, I'll try.

1412
01:24:15.76 --> 01:24:19.000
Because you're going from zero up to like, you know, the learning curve.

1413
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.28
Yeah, it's more steep for sure.

1414
01:24:21.28 --> 01:24:24.40
But yeah, I think that's a good attitude to maintain.

1415
01:24:24.40 --> 01:24:26.24
And all costs like maintain that attitude.

1416
01:24:26.24 --> 01:24:28.68
I just want to learn the next thing to learn.

1417
01:24:28.68 --> 01:24:33.92
If the other thing that's the other thing that's a bummer on that, same topic is when

1418
01:24:33.92 --> 01:24:38.24
people get the purple belt, then you never see them again.

1419
01:24:38.24 --> 01:24:39.24
Yeah.

1420
01:24:39.24 --> 01:24:40.48
Or they get their brown belt and you never see them again.

1421
01:24:40.48 --> 01:24:41.88
They get their black belt and they never see them again.

1422
01:24:41.88 --> 01:24:44.88
You know, you just start now when you get your purple belt.

1423
01:24:44.88 --> 01:24:46.48
It's when you're starting to get good.

1424
01:24:46.48 --> 01:24:49.56
That's when you're starting to become a real duit duit player.

1425
01:24:49.56 --> 01:24:50.56
Yeah.

1426
01:24:50.56 --> 01:24:51.56
Yeah.

1427
01:24:51.56 --> 01:24:53.56
It's when you have a lot.

1428
01:24:53.56 --> 01:24:57.80
And I want to say most are all or nothing, but you have a lot of legit set weapons.

1429
01:24:57.80 --> 01:24:58.80
Yeah.

1430
01:24:58.80 --> 01:24:59.80
I just don't know how to use them for sure.

1431
01:24:59.80 --> 01:25:00.80
I'm going to start learning how to use them for sure.

1432
01:25:00.80 --> 01:25:02.80
The difference is the purple belt and a blue belt.

1433
01:25:02.80 --> 01:25:05.92
I mean, a purple belt, you know, I'll roll with purple belt in our gym and they're

1434
01:25:05.92 --> 01:25:10.80
competitive, you know, most of the blue belts, unless there's studs are, you know, you're

1435
01:25:10.80 --> 01:25:14.52
not going to be really threatened with anything even positionally.

1436
01:25:14.52 --> 01:25:15.52
Right.

1437
01:25:15.52 --> 01:25:16.52
But the purple belt's a whole different story.

1438
01:25:16.52 --> 01:25:17.88
You know, you make a mistake with a purple belt.

1439
01:25:17.88 --> 01:25:19.52
They're there right there and bound.

1440
01:25:19.52 --> 01:25:20.52
No.

1441
01:25:20.52 --> 01:25:21.52
Yep.

1442
01:25:21.52 --> 01:25:22.52
Absolutely true.

1443
01:25:22.52 --> 01:25:28.24
So we're doing because in my experience anyway, I've seen their like polar opposites as

1444
01:25:28.24 --> 01:25:32.40
far as that kind of personality, the guy who will get a belt in disappear or the guy who

1445
01:25:32.40 --> 01:25:34.52
will get a belt in the day he gets his belt.

1446
01:25:34.52 --> 01:25:38.36
He's like, like he's been training for six months when you weren't looking or something

1447
01:25:38.36 --> 01:25:41.000
just in that one day because I think it's a mental thing.

1448
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.48
Oh, they rise to the occasion.

1449
01:25:42.48 --> 01:25:43.48
Exactly.

1450
01:25:43.48 --> 01:25:44.48
Right.

1451
01:25:44.48 --> 01:25:45.48
Got it.

1452
01:25:45.48 --> 01:25:46.48
Yeah.

1453
01:25:46.48 --> 01:25:51.40
And they're like, don't be in a hurry to get your belts anyways because you have so much more

1454
01:25:51.40 --> 01:25:55.20
free to make mistakes or a blue belt, your white belt.

1455
01:25:55.20 --> 01:26:00.36
I kept one of my buddies as a white belt for like years.

1456
01:26:00.36 --> 01:26:05.28
And I said, and right now, you know what he is, been training for 10 years, blue belt.

1457
01:26:05.28 --> 01:26:09.000
Because he's overseas, he's been traveling all this stuff and he should be a purple belt

1458
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:10.000
at least.

1459
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Yeah.

1460
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.56
He's tapping out black belts.

1461
01:26:12.56 --> 01:26:14.44
So they're going to give it to him where he's training.

1462
01:26:14.44 --> 01:26:15.44
But yeah.

1463
01:26:15.44 --> 01:26:19.72
The other thing is, and it's easier said than done, I think, especially if you're in a certain

1464
01:26:19.72 --> 01:26:25.12
environment or a certain type of person, but if at all possible, don't think about the

1465
01:26:25.12 --> 01:26:26.76
belt, I don't think about your belt.

1466
01:26:26.76 --> 01:26:28.96
I think that's the thing about the knowledge.

1467
01:26:28.96 --> 01:26:29.96
Yeah.

1468
01:26:29.96 --> 01:26:34.80
That'll be the one way to get into this little realm of thinking due to it's a long repetitive

1469
01:26:34.80 --> 01:26:35.80
grind.

1470
01:26:35.80 --> 01:26:36.80
Not guaranteed.

1471
01:26:36.80 --> 01:26:41.28
I'm not saying that's why, but I'm saying that is a good way to definitely like

1472
01:26:41.28 --> 01:26:42.68
that definite factor.

1473
01:26:42.68 --> 01:26:43.68
Yes.

1474
01:26:43.68 --> 01:26:44.68
Big time, big time.

1475
01:26:44.68 --> 01:26:45.68
Next question.

1476
01:26:45.68 --> 01:26:54.12
Jockel, from your experience or observation, how does one learn humility?

1477
01:26:54.12 --> 01:26:59.36
And on top of that, talk about gaining more self-confidence.

1478
01:26:59.36 --> 01:27:02.08
So this here was actually two questions.

1479
01:27:02.08 --> 01:27:03.08
Two questions.

1480
01:27:03.08 --> 01:27:07.96
One of them, how do you learn humility and the other one is how do you gain more self-confidence

1481
01:27:07.96 --> 01:27:14.000
of course, I paired these together because there's a dichotomy in those two, right?

1482
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.88
If you have a bunch of self-confidence and you're not being humble and if you're being too

1483
01:27:17.88 --> 01:27:19.60
humble and you don't have self-confidence.

1484
01:27:19.60 --> 01:27:27.12
So a good analogy of this, of course, what we were just talking about is to jitsu because

1485
01:27:27.12 --> 01:27:30.92
when you start, you jitsu and we'll turn this into a metaphor for life.

1486
01:27:30.92 --> 01:27:37.72
When you start, you jitsu, you very quickly learn number one that you can get beat, that

1487
01:27:37.72 --> 01:27:41.84
you're not everything that you thought you were, right?

1488
01:27:41.84 --> 01:27:45.04
And at the same time, you start to gain confidence.

1489
01:27:45.04 --> 01:27:49.52
I mean, it makes you more confident because you realize that as you have knowledge, it's

1490
01:27:49.52 --> 01:27:52.48
the things that other people don't know.

1491
01:27:52.48 --> 01:28:00.48
And so it's the same thing with life because if you're in life and you step out into the arena,

1492
01:28:00.48 --> 01:28:01.48
right?

1493
01:28:01.48 --> 01:28:02.80
You're going to realize that you're not.

1494
01:28:02.80 --> 01:28:04.28
You don't know everything.

1495
01:28:04.28 --> 01:28:08.52
That's something you're going to realize.

1496
01:28:08.52 --> 01:28:16.68
The more that you realize that you don't know everything, the more it humbles you, but

1497
01:28:16.68 --> 01:28:22.64
also in a reverse way actually makes you more confident because now you're gaining knowledge

1498
01:28:22.64 --> 01:28:24.84
because you are stepping into the arena.

1499
01:28:24.84 --> 01:28:31.72
So it's like when you jitsu, when you spar and you're roll, you're going to get tapped.

1500
01:28:31.72 --> 01:28:34.28
Yes, but the more you do it, the more confident you get.

1501
01:28:34.28 --> 01:28:37.96
And the more you accept the fact that you don't know everything you don't like the question

1502
01:28:37.96 --> 01:28:39.84
before like what are you embarrassed about?

1503
01:28:39.84 --> 01:28:41.84
How do you mean, embarrassed in the sport?

1504
01:28:41.84 --> 01:28:42.84
Don't be embarrassed.

1505
01:28:42.84 --> 01:28:44.48
Go there and get tapped out.

1506
01:28:44.48 --> 01:28:45.48
Good.

1507
01:28:45.48 --> 01:28:46.48
You're learning.

1508
01:28:46.48 --> 01:28:49.68
And that's what you have to do in life.

1509
01:28:49.68 --> 01:28:56.28
If you want to gain humility and you want to gain self-confidence in life, you have to get

1510
01:28:56.28 --> 01:28:58.04
on the mat.

1511
01:28:58.04 --> 01:29:00.92
You've got to step up in lead.

1512
01:29:00.92 --> 01:29:02.24
You've got to step up and talk.

1513
01:29:02.24 --> 01:29:04.20
You've got to volunteer for the hard job.

1514
01:29:04.20 --> 01:29:05.76
You've got to take risks.

1515
01:29:05.76 --> 01:29:09.64
That's how you're going to gain the confidence and the humility because sometimes you're

1516
01:29:09.64 --> 01:29:13.36
going to get beat, sometimes you're going to win.

1517
01:29:13.36 --> 01:29:19.80
But you won't make any of that progress unless you take the opportunity to step out on

1518
01:29:19.80 --> 01:29:25.04
the mat, step into the arena, step into the cage, step onto the stage, step up onto

1519
01:29:25.04 --> 01:29:27.76
the leadership pedestal.

1520
01:29:27.76 --> 01:29:29.64
That's how you make it work.

1521
01:29:29.64 --> 01:29:34.32
Because when you're humble, that's what humility comes from.

1522
01:29:34.32 --> 01:29:38.48
You realize that you're not perfect and you realize that nobody is.

1523
01:29:38.48 --> 01:29:41.88
So it's like that old thing, a walk in and picture everyone with their underwear on or

1524
01:29:41.88 --> 01:29:42.88
whatever.

1525
01:29:42.88 --> 01:29:46.08
When you realize that everyone else is human, that increases your confidence.

1526
01:29:46.08 --> 01:29:48.08
Because you're not looking at everyone like that.

1527
01:29:48.08 --> 01:29:49.08
They're masters.

1528
01:29:49.08 --> 01:29:50.08
No, they're not.

1529
01:29:50.08 --> 01:29:52.84
They're just other people.

1530
01:29:52.84 --> 01:29:55.08
So that's what I would do.

1531
01:29:55.08 --> 01:30:01.52
If you want to gain confidence and you want to gain humility, both of them get out there, get

1532
01:30:01.52 --> 01:30:07.44
on the mat, get on the stage or in the game, into the leadership position, whatever

1533
01:30:07.44 --> 01:30:13.36
the case may be, and live, and don't be embarrassed.

1534
01:30:13.36 --> 01:30:16.28
And don't be abusive when you do do well.

1535
01:30:16.28 --> 01:30:17.68
You know, that's the thing.

1536
01:30:17.68 --> 01:30:18.68
Again, that's the thing about you.

1537
01:30:18.68 --> 01:30:19.68
Just doing this.

1538
01:30:19.68 --> 01:30:20.68
Think about life.

1539
01:30:20.68 --> 01:30:22.76
You realize you're not going to be there's always going to be someone that's better

1540
01:30:22.76 --> 01:30:23.76
than you.

1541
01:30:23.76 --> 01:30:24.76
That's okay.

1542
01:30:24.76 --> 01:30:25.76
Just be humble.

1543
01:30:25.76 --> 01:30:27.88
Learn from it.

1544
01:30:27.88 --> 01:30:30.16
And when you know that there's other people that are going to be better than you, it's

1545
01:30:30.16 --> 01:30:31.16
okay.

1546
01:30:31.16 --> 01:30:35.24
And what you can do, because you know you're going to be better than other people.

1547
01:30:35.24 --> 01:30:41.40
Yeah, I was talking with Greg and Tim today about humility.

1548
01:30:41.40 --> 01:30:45.72
So there's like internal humility and external humility.

1549
01:30:45.72 --> 01:30:49.000
So the external humility isn't really humility.

1550
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:53.96
It's the guy who's super respectful when he talks to people and how he talks, but on

1551
01:30:53.96 --> 01:30:56.48
the inside he's like, I'm better than anyone.

1552
01:30:56.48 --> 01:30:58.20
I know everything.

1553
01:30:58.20 --> 01:31:02.68
And the opposite is if someone's the opposite, on the outside he's like, heck yeah,

1554
01:31:02.68 --> 01:31:03.68
like a conner McGregor.

1555
01:31:03.68 --> 01:31:04.88
Like I'm the, you know, I'm the greatest.

1556
01:31:04.88 --> 01:31:05.88
I'm going to beat on my time.

1557
01:31:05.88 --> 01:31:08.60
He is dope and all this stuff and how good I am.

1558
01:31:08.60 --> 01:31:11.80
But on the inside when it comes down, when no one's looking, when it's time to train,

1559
01:31:11.80 --> 01:31:13.20
he's learning from everyone.

1560
01:31:13.20 --> 01:31:15.36
Some guy, a white belt gives him a tip.

1561
01:31:15.36 --> 01:31:17.80
He considers that tip is it's going to help me.

1562
01:31:17.80 --> 01:31:18.80
You know?

1563
01:31:18.80 --> 01:31:22.36
So he's humility allows him to learn from everybody.

1564
01:31:22.36 --> 01:31:27.88
And you know, he ends up being more successful because of that humility.

1565
01:31:27.88 --> 01:31:30.40
And that's like the internally humility.

1566
01:31:30.40 --> 01:31:31.80
That's true statements.

1567
01:31:31.80 --> 01:31:37.60
You know, you know, some people they're like, hey, I'm not cocky.

1568
01:31:37.60 --> 01:31:40.04
I'm confident.

1569
01:31:40.04 --> 01:31:42.44
Do you think that there's like a difference between others?

1570
01:31:42.44 --> 01:31:43.44
There's absolutely a difference.

1571
01:31:43.44 --> 01:31:44.44
There's absolutely a difference.

1572
01:31:44.44 --> 01:31:45.44
There's absolutely a difference.

1573
01:31:45.44 --> 01:31:49.36
And it's a dichotomy because you have to be confident, but not cocky.

1574
01:31:49.36 --> 01:31:50.36
Right?

1575
01:31:50.36 --> 01:31:54.32
Confidence, like, you know, confidence saying, I know I can, I know I could win this match or

1576
01:31:54.32 --> 01:31:57.80
hey, I know I can make this happen or hey, I know I can lead this mission or

1577
01:31:57.80 --> 01:31:58.80
whatever.

1578
01:31:58.80 --> 01:31:59.80
That's just nothing wrong with that.

1579
01:31:59.80 --> 01:32:00.80
Yeah.

1580
01:32:00.80 --> 01:32:05.04
Cocky is, hey, I know I can win this and I don't even need to train.

1581
01:32:05.04 --> 01:32:06.04
Right.

1582
01:32:06.04 --> 01:32:08.36
I know I can lead this mission and we don't even need to prepare.

1583
01:32:08.36 --> 01:32:09.36
That's cocky.

1584
01:32:09.36 --> 01:32:10.36
And that's wrong.

1585
01:32:10.36 --> 01:32:11.76
So confident, but not cocky.

1586
01:32:11.76 --> 01:32:17.20
It's a simple dichotomy, a leadership which is actually in the book.

1587
01:32:17.20 --> 01:32:20.12
So yes, there is a difference.

1588
01:32:20.12 --> 01:32:25.56
And you know, some people, they won't do it necessarily in terms of being a leader or anything

1589
01:32:25.56 --> 01:32:26.56
like that.

1590
01:32:26.56 --> 01:32:28.08
It's not kind of in life, you know, these people.

1591
01:32:28.08 --> 01:32:31.32
It's like, yeah, because they talk about themselves all the time or something like that.

1592
01:32:31.32 --> 01:32:32.32
Right?

1593
01:32:32.32 --> 01:32:38.44
So in those cases, I kind of differentiated it where a cocky person is going to talk about

1594
01:32:38.44 --> 01:32:43.12
himself and how good he or she or whatever is unprompted.

1595
01:32:43.12 --> 01:32:48.32
Confidence is they're going to answer honestly about how they feel about their preparedness

1596
01:32:48.32 --> 01:32:50.60
or skill or whatever, but it has to be prompted.

1597
01:32:50.60 --> 01:32:51.60
Fair enough.

1598
01:32:51.60 --> 01:32:55.84
Just go out of their way and be like, I'm the greatest, you know, but if someone's like,

1599
01:32:55.84 --> 01:32:59.16
hey, you know, honest question, do you think you're the greatest and they really think

1600
01:32:59.16 --> 01:33:02.96
they are the greatest in their experience or whatever, they're going to say the honest thing.

1601
01:33:02.96 --> 01:33:05.92
No, that's like a confident versus cocky.

1602
01:33:05.92 --> 01:33:12.92
I was my daughter said the other day, I was considering bringing my daughter on the, my

1603
01:33:12.92 --> 01:33:16.12
oldest daughter on the podcast because people ask about parenting a lot.

1604
01:33:16.12 --> 01:33:17.60
I'm not going to do it.

1605
01:33:17.60 --> 01:33:19.32
I decided.

1606
01:33:19.32 --> 01:33:23.80
But you know, I was like, well, what kind of questions would I ask her?

1607
01:33:23.80 --> 01:33:26.16
And I said, well, tell, you know, I was just kind of experimenting.

1608
01:33:26.16 --> 01:33:31.60
I said, tell people something that they wouldn't expect about me or something that you

1609
01:33:31.60 --> 01:33:32.60
recognize about me.

1610
01:33:32.60 --> 01:33:35.08
And one of the things she said, which he heard me talking to someone about you, just

1611
01:33:35.08 --> 01:33:36.92
who that didn't know me.

1612
01:33:36.92 --> 01:33:38.92
And they were like, oh, oh, do you train you, Jitsu?

1613
01:33:38.92 --> 01:33:39.92
And I said, oh, yeah, I do.

1614
01:33:39.92 --> 01:33:41.92
And they said, are you good?

1615
01:33:41.92 --> 01:33:45.000
And I said, like, I'm all right, you know, I've been training for a while.

1616
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000
So I'm all right.

1617
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:50.40
And she said, I was really like, I was surprised at how humble you were even doing Jitsu for

1618
01:33:50.40 --> 01:33:51.40
20 years.

1619
01:33:51.40 --> 01:33:53.60
And you know, I said, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, nobody's

1620
01:33:53.60 --> 01:33:54.88
well, that person might be better than me.

1621
01:33:54.88 --> 01:33:55.88
That's a reality.

1622
01:33:55.88 --> 01:33:59.000
I'm just like, oh, yeah, I'm really good, you know.

1623
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.08
Yeah.

1624
01:34:00.08 --> 01:34:02.24
And you know what, I'm listening to this.

1625
01:34:02.24 --> 01:34:07.28
And I'm trying to, I'm trying to think in my experience, your reaction to, you

1626
01:34:07.28 --> 01:34:09.52
need you just to questions in that way, where.

1627
01:34:09.52 --> 01:34:12.36
So I don't think I've ever heard you.

1628
01:34:12.36 --> 01:34:16.20
And I've known you for 10 years, I think maybe 8 years or so.

1629
01:34:16.20 --> 01:34:19.14
I don't think I've ever heard you say, yeah, I top that guy out.

1630
01:34:19.14 --> 01:34:22.08
I don't think I've ever heard you say that.

1631
01:34:22.08 --> 01:34:31.08
Yeah, if I ask, no, no, I can't really like picture you saying that. Yeah, I tapped it right. I tapped them up.

1632
01:34:31.08 --> 01:34:42.08
Yeah, it's one of those weird things too because it, it, in a one way, it means something in another way it doesn't mean anything.

1633
01:34:42.08 --> 01:34:45.08
Yeah, it's been trained for longer than you, you write them a stick, you know?

1634
01:34:45.08 --> 01:34:50.08
Yeah, exactly. That's kind of the point where it's in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter. You're right.

1635
01:34:50.08 --> 01:34:57.08
You mature way that's, you know, part of that, if you've been doing jiu-jitsu for even a little while, you'll have at least this much of it in you.

1636
01:34:57.08 --> 01:35:04.08
Like, hey, did you tap that guy out? Kind of thing. And I was reading a thing just kind of online a little fun thing where it was like unwritten rules of jiu-jitsu.

1637
01:35:04.08 --> 01:35:08.08
You don't go and talk about how you tap this guy out today. You don't do that. And that's true.

1638
01:35:08.08 --> 01:35:15.08
Yeah. But the reason there's an article like that is because it's a small part of that, in all of us that wants to say, you know, hey, you know,

1639
01:35:15.08 --> 01:35:22.08
maybe with your close friends, you'd be like, hey, did you get them in and you'd be like, yeah, or you'll come to tell your wife who doesn't care at all, by the way.

1640
01:35:22.08 --> 01:35:29.08
But it's there in you. But with maturity, you're not going to go and say, hello, yeah, I tapped him out.

1641
01:35:29.08 --> 01:35:35.08
Yeah, but with you, I mean, especially now we're kind of close. I still don't, I've never heard you say, yeah, I got him. I tapped him out.

1642
01:35:35.08 --> 01:35:41.08
Even when I remember one time, I'm not going to say who could he's a well-known guy and he came and visited it and I rolled when he just beat me up.

1643
01:35:41.08 --> 01:35:45.08
And then you rolled with him, I didn't see the whole Royce, I guess we're only going to ask you afterwards.

1644
01:35:45.08 --> 01:35:50.08
I was like, hey, so you know, like, all I said was what happened? Because I didn't remember that's how you'd always ask me.

1645
01:35:50.08 --> 01:35:54.08
You know, like, hey, what happened? You know, like, how do you go kind of thing?

1646
01:35:54.08 --> 01:35:59.08
And then, so I asked you that and you're like, it sounded, it really felt like you wanted to say it.

1647
01:35:59.08 --> 01:36:06.08
But it was like almost like you had this rule almost or something. You were like, we were getting after it.

1648
01:36:06.08 --> 01:36:15.08
You just left it and I was like, I respect it. But yeah, yeah. And I just kind of realized that. I don't think you've ever said that.

1649
01:36:15.08 --> 01:36:18.08
Yeah, I think that's probably a decent policy to have.

1650
01:36:18.08 --> 01:36:21.08
Yeah, I had a guy one time that passed my guard.

1651
01:36:21.08 --> 01:36:33.08
And he, no, it wasn't you. Somebody passed my guard and held it for about a second and a half and then stood up and literally ran around.

1652
01:36:33.08 --> 01:36:38.08
Right, right, screaming. No, this is 50. Yeah, you told me about that. Yeah, I was kind of wild.

1653
01:36:38.08 --> 01:36:45.08
You know, it's strange. That was really strange to you. But although I would maybe, I'm not saying I would never do that. I might do that as a joke, you know,

1654
01:36:45.08 --> 01:36:48.08
But I feel where he was coming from.

1655
01:36:48.08 --> 01:36:50.08
Yeah, it's it.

1656
01:36:50.08 --> 01:37:00.08
You know, actually for a while, this helped me back because people got so intent on passing my guard that I had to defend it as if I was defending a tap.

1657
01:37:00.08 --> 01:37:10.08
Yeah, I'm not kidding. Yeah, yeah. And so now, and then finally, like probably six months ago, maybe a year ago, I just said, you know, I'm starting to let people pass my guard just so I can play different parts of the game.

1658
01:37:10.08 --> 01:37:14.08
And so now I just, you know, I'm not that concerned about it anymore.

1659
01:37:14.08 --> 01:37:17.08
Mm-hmm. People get no crazy.

1660
01:37:20.08 --> 01:37:22.08
Uh, mixed question.

1661
01:37:22.08 --> 01:37:33.08
Do you centralize command? Every thought of how parents ultimately deployed their children into the world and the parallels?

1662
01:37:33.08 --> 01:37:38.08
Yeah, and so people have been asking me to talk about parenting.

1663
01:37:38.08 --> 01:37:39.08
Mm-hmm.

1664
01:37:39.08 --> 01:37:51.08
Since the podcast started, and I really have been avoiding it. Again, one of the things I was considering was bringing my daughter on possibly, and I'm not going to do it.

1665
01:37:51.08 --> 01:38:04.08
And, you know, my oldest daughter, she's 16. And I was thinking myself, if I was on a video or a recording when I was 16 years old, I would not want to hear that. I would not want to be that.

1666
01:38:04.08 --> 01:38:20.08
You know, just wouldn't want that. So I'm not going to do that to my daughter, even though she's super mature, smart, articulate. It would definitely be interesting, but I'm not going to subject her to that kind of environment.

1667
01:38:20.08 --> 01:38:33.08
And the other reason I don't want to talk about parenting very much is because my oldest kid is 16. I have no idea if I've been successful or not. I don't. I mean, doing great in school, great. That's cool.

1668
01:38:33.08 --> 01:38:44.08
But I need another 10 years before I can pass judgment and actually maybe even more than that because if they're successful not because, okay, if they're successful, what's success?

1669
01:38:44.08 --> 01:38:50.08
Then they got into a good college that they got a good job that they have lots of money that they have kids spouse house cars, whatever.

1670
01:38:50.08 --> 01:38:56.08
But at the same time, what if they have all that, but they're miserable because that happens all the time. I meet people like that all the time.

1671
01:38:56.08 --> 01:39:02.08
They got a bunch of money. They're not successful because they're angry. They're upset. They're depressed. They're life sucks.

1672
01:39:02.08 --> 01:39:10.08
So was I a good parent if I drove them into that position? Maybe not. So I'm not.

1673
01:39:10.08 --> 01:39:19.08
I'm not. I don't like to. I don't want to talk about something that I'm not feeling super confident about because I can't pass judgment yet.

1674
01:39:19.08 --> 01:39:24.08
I can tell you my opinion, but even that, I don't want to influence you and I don't have facts.

1675
01:39:24.08 --> 01:39:35.08
You know, I can tell you about leadership because I've been in leadership positions, hard ones. And I can talk with at least some some level of confidence that what I'm saying is true because I've seen it.

1676
01:39:35.08 --> 01:39:43.08
And I've seen it in the military and I've seen it in the civilian world and I've seen it on teams. I've seen it a bunch of different places. So I have a pretty good feeling about it.

1677
01:39:43.08 --> 01:39:50.08
Parenting, but it's just, it's just a little bit different because I don't know because there's definitely a different interaction.

1678
01:39:50.08 --> 01:39:58.08
Now, and for everyone that's been waiting this entire podcast here, it comes. That being said.

1679
01:39:58.08 --> 01:40:14.08
You do absolutely have to use decentralized command with your kids because you're not going to be there for every decision that they make. You're not going to be there every time they get passed a drug disorder every time they've had some alcohol and they need to drive somewhere or

1680
01:40:14.08 --> 01:40:23.08
Every time they stumble into a bad situation or they see someone participating in something that's wrong or they see someone perpetrating a crime and maybe they could do something.

1681
01:40:23.08 --> 01:40:37.08
So it's not going to be there all the time. So just like decentralized command, you have to set them up. You have to put them. You have to give them guidelines that they're going to take out their commanders intent.

1682
01:40:37.08 --> 01:40:48.08
They've got to understand right and wrong. They've got to understand long-term goals. They've got to understand consequences. They've got to understand accountability for their actions.

1683
01:40:48.08 --> 01:41:02.08
And they've got to understand, I think, this is one of the most important things to keep teach kids is they've got to understand how what they're doing today is going to affect their lives in five years and three years in ten years in 15 years.

1684
01:41:02.08 --> 01:41:11.08
The things that you're doing today and some adults don't even get that. Unfortunately, that what you're doing today is going to affect you long term.

1685
01:41:11.08 --> 01:41:21.08
And there were some times where I slid into that, you know, you're in the steel teams, you just don't think it's going to last forever. You know, so here's going to do what you're going to do.

1686
01:41:21.08 --> 01:41:28.08
And so that's commanders intent. That's giving your subordinate leadership, which is your kids.

1687
01:41:28.08 --> 01:41:39.08
The understanding, just like Mao said, the understanding of why they're doing what they're doing, why they're health matters, why they're education matters, why respecting people matters.

1688
01:41:39.08 --> 01:41:49.08
Why creativity matters, all these different things, explaining them why so that they understand so that when they are out there and they have to make a decision.

1689
01:41:49.08 --> 01:41:58.08
They have to choose that they understand why the decision matters and therefore they can act appropriately.

1690
01:41:58.08 --> 01:42:10.08
And I think that's what you have to do as a parent who is in fact leading your children through life, whether you like it or not.

1691
01:42:10.08 --> 01:42:15.08
Yeah, and then I think that that's boom.

1692
01:42:15.08 --> 01:42:30.08
That's a good move. Not getting too deep into specific things about how you specifically parent because there's like, is there even such thing is perfect parenting everyone like everyone's desires for the way the kids turn out is different.

1693
01:42:30.08 --> 01:42:48.08
So people want their, you know, their kid to be this free spirit travel the world don't get nailed to them.

1694
01:42:48.08 --> 01:43:10.08
And that's the last part to develop as a human being. It's the last part of your brain. That's the way teenage boys especially right teenage 16, 17, 18, they get equipped with basically all the hardware but the software the part that controls it is all jumped up so they're physically strong like at hormones.

1695
01:43:10.08 --> 01:43:25.08
They got a driver's license probably they have a right now, right? So they go off and they're just basically shooting off their guns with no, you know, no, you know, whatever the software is to, yeah, you know, so that's what they make mistakes.

1696
01:43:25.08 --> 01:43:39.08
That's the way they make all these these crazy mistakes with their frisly influence through friends because the part of their brain that that helps determine, okay, this this consequence is going to come along with this specific action is underdeveloped.

1697
01:43:39.08 --> 01:43:47.08
And on average, any gives you, you know, let's give her take that on average it gets fully developed at about 24 25 years old.

1698
01:43:47.08 --> 01:43:54.08
Oh, that explains a lot. Yeah, it does absolutely does. So that's as far as decision making so.

1699
01:43:54.08 --> 01:44:05.08
So yeah, and that that probably explains why dealing with teenagers becomes harder because they have all this hardware and the software still is trying to be updated.

1700
01:44:05.08 --> 01:44:14.08
But back to the perfect current thing, there's no real perfect parent people want different things for their kid and everyone's different everyone has different philosophy to explain come doing not spank on my read this or that.

1701
01:44:14.08 --> 01:44:26.08
So the outcome is going to be different and those different outcomes are going to appeal to different people. So it's basically like if you have a specific outcome that you want your kid to have.

1702
01:44:26.08 --> 01:44:37.08
It's going to be determined by a bunch of things, but I think in my experience and both being a parent and having parents, so to speak, is consistency.

1703
01:44:37.08 --> 01:44:46.08
Like if you could, if you have a message or you know, some kind of discipline they're imposing or some kind of just idea that you want to you want to stick with your kids.

1704
01:44:46.08 --> 01:45:04.08
Be consistent on it. Don't, you know, don't say, hey, no jumping on the bed one day and then the next day you don't feel lazy or tired or whatever and you don't say, hey, don't jump on the bed because they're going to be like, oh, well, is this today I can jump on the bed or is it not I want to jump on the bed when you're not looking guess what I'm going to be doing.

1705
01:45:04.08 --> 01:45:17.08
I know that's not when you say, but if you're no jumping there, but jump, jump there, just going to say, okay, there's no jumping on the bed because they're going to be influenced by somebody. They're going to get rules and how do I act? How do I be? What do I say? What don't I say? They're going to get that from somebody.

1706
01:45:17.08 --> 01:45:21.08
And if you're all inconsistent, you might as well just be noise on the TV that comes on sometimes.

1707
01:45:21.08 --> 01:45:37.08
If you're inconsistent with it, they're going to get it from, I don't know, someone who's more consistent that could be the neighbor that could be TV that could be the kid that they look up to in school who's not very smart or maybe it's smart. I don't know there's a teacher at, you know, that drug dealer, whoever they're going to get it from somewhere.

1708
01:45:37.08 --> 01:45:53.08
So I think it would be consistent, they'll get it from you. And the more things that you that are conducive to their success in whatever, whatever you consider, consists of our success, the more consistency you display in regards to those things because you know that outcome.

1709
01:45:53.08 --> 01:46:01.08
You know that outcome that they want. You know that if they act a certain way, it's going to facilitate this certain outcome. You know that, or you should, I hope you'll be doing.

1710
01:46:01.08 --> 01:46:11.08
So if you just remain consistent on those issues to shape that, that's when it's going to work. I'm going to throw one more wrench into your system.

1711
01:46:11.08 --> 01:46:15.08
I was kind of agreeing with what you're saying, but I just want to throw this out there for everybody.

1712
01:46:15.08 --> 01:46:25.08
If you got kids in my opinion, your kids are not going to be who you want them to be.

1713
01:46:25.08 --> 01:46:35.08
They're going to be them. And that is the biggest hurdle to get over mentally. I had to get, I thought that the kids wouldn't be what I wanted to be.

1714
01:46:35.08 --> 01:46:43.08
But guess what they're not, they're going to be what they are. They're humans. And I got four kids and every one of them is completely different from the other one.

1715
01:46:43.08 --> 01:46:51.08
They all came from me, but they're all, and they all got raised with the same me and my same wife.

1716
01:46:51.08 --> 01:47:04.08
And yet they're all radically different. Why is that? It's because they're different humans. And so if you try and impose your vision on your kids, it will not be successful.

1717
01:47:04.08 --> 01:47:15.08
And you'll have a meltdown at some point. That's my opinion. I could be wrong, but that's my opinion. And I am not an expert on parenting.

1718
01:47:15.08 --> 01:47:23.08
And I don't want to people to obey my thoughts on parenting. But I got asked the question, so I answered it.

1719
01:47:23.08 --> 01:47:25.08
And I'm going to leave it at that.

1720
01:47:25.08 --> 01:47:39.08
Yeah, that's, and so much has to do with their environment. So where each kid, like, let's, if you get four kids, right? The first kid coming, you know, coming into the world and boom.

1721
01:47:39.08 --> 01:47:48.08
Yeah, the first born, the psychology and all this stuff. And I'm not even saying that sir, I'm not going to go into the psychology part of it. I'm just saying boom, that's a different experience all together.

1722
01:47:48.08 --> 01:47:55.08
Being the second you had the same thing. He has that one kid and then all these little kids behind him. You know, so it's just you just ought to write out the gate you're a different person.

1723
01:47:55.08 --> 01:48:09.08
You know, so that's where you're going to see all these crazy different personalities. We were raised in the same house, same parents, my parents were the same the whole time, but just starting out. It's like, you ever see prices right, they game.

1724
01:48:09.08 --> 01:48:13.08
Or the game show prices right. I'm rolled school, Bob Barker. I think it's somebody else now.

1725
01:48:13.08 --> 01:48:31.08
There's a game called Plinkle and it's this, this is so long. Exploding. It's a little Plinkle where it's like this board right and at the end it's are these little slots and you drop this kind of this it's not a ball. It's like a little pocket kind of good, but I get the image.

1726
01:48:31.08 --> 01:48:39.08
It's like these pins. So it goes, it randomly just go, made it go through this one and you can kind of forget if you can control it or not.

1727
01:48:39.08 --> 01:48:53.08
Yeah, so as a parent you control the board, but there's so many different little things that it can hit and go this way. So if you're consistent and just consistently pushing on direction it'll tend to go but then all the sub all these other factors are in play that you can't control.

1728
01:48:53.08 --> 01:49:03.08
So it's eventually that's how it is and that's true. How you say you can't just shape exactly who you want to be in Plinkle. You don't say, hey, I'm going to get it in that little slot right there and then he goes there every time.

1729
01:49:03.08 --> 01:49:11.08
It's really hard to do that. Played Go Game. I'm telling you, play it Go You look into it. Same thing. It's exactly Plinkle parenting. Same thing.

1730
01:49:11.08 --> 01:49:14.08
This is a jockel podcast. Plinkle boards on there.

1731
01:49:14.08 --> 01:49:17.08
See now you've gone too far.

1732
01:49:17.08 --> 01:49:21.08
All right. Next question. Be careful with your kids as all I'm saying.

1733
01:49:21.08 --> 01:49:24.08
Careful with your kids. Give them the broad guidance.

1734
01:49:24.08 --> 01:49:25.08
Yeah.

1735
01:49:25.08 --> 01:49:31.08
That's what you want to give them. Why health matters? Why education matters? Why respect matters? Why creativity matters?

1736
01:49:31.08 --> 01:49:38.08
Let them understand why so that they can make their own decisions because they are their own people.

1737
01:49:38.08 --> 01:49:41.08
Let's true story. Next question.

1738
01:49:41.08 --> 01:49:44.08
So what do you think about CrossFit?

1739
01:49:44.08 --> 01:49:49.08
Seems you do a lot of the same movements and workouts games.

1740
01:49:49.08 --> 01:49:57.08
So CrossFit. I think CrossFit is a solid base for things.

1741
01:49:57.08 --> 01:50:08.08
I also think that CrossFit actually deserves a pretty good amount of credit for getting the general populace of the world moving in the right direction when it comes to fitness.

1742
01:50:08.08 --> 01:50:15.08
I've been doing CrossFit type stuff before there was such a thing as CrossFit.

1743
01:50:15.08 --> 01:50:22.08
I mean the movements that you use in CrossFit are movements that event anything new, right?

1744
01:50:22.08 --> 01:50:29.08
But they did reintroduce kind of like the Gracie family to be honest with you.

1745
01:50:29.08 --> 01:50:37.08
Both the Gracie family and CrossFit, in my opinion, are responsible for really a paradigm shift in those two arenas.

1746
01:50:37.08 --> 01:50:40.08
They are renafitness and the arena of martial arts.

1747
01:50:40.08 --> 01:50:46.08
If you look at martial arts in the 70s and the 80s, what was it?

1748
01:50:46.08 --> 01:50:53.08
It was told. It was karate. It was kung fu. It was Ikedo. It was traditional martial arts.

1749
01:50:53.08 --> 01:51:00.08
It was not full contact sparring. It was just radically different than what it is now.

1750
01:51:00.08 --> 01:51:11.08
And that came from the Gracie family who created the UFC and broadcast it and got the information out there and spread the word of jujitsu, which part of jujitsu.

1751
01:51:11.08 --> 01:51:16.08
And part of the UFC is that you have to learn to wrestle and you have to learn to strike. So that all kind of came afterwards.

1752
01:51:16.08 --> 01:51:25.08
But it's all related to the initial, the initial birth of the UFC and Gracie jujitsu.

1753
01:51:25.08 --> 01:51:34.08
And that's the same thing in my opinion with CrossFit. CrossFit again, where people doing Olympic lifting years ago, yes, they were.

1754
01:51:34.08 --> 01:51:47.08
But it's a very small. If you look at the martial arts schools and the 70s, look at fitness places in the 70s and 80s, it was those weird machines and aerobic stuff.

1755
01:51:47.08 --> 01:51:55.08
And the thing that women would tie around their stomachs and would shake them, I mean, just all kinds of bizarre stuff.

1756
01:51:55.08 --> 01:52:17.08
And that's just stuff that was just ineffective. And so I think CrossFit deserves credit for spreading, you know, the knowledge of squatting and clean in jerks and pull ups and muscle ups and all those things.

1757
01:52:17.08 --> 01:52:25.08
And so, you know, again, like I said, it's you've got, there were decathletes before CrossFit.

1758
01:52:25.08 --> 01:52:30.08
There were Olympic lift, there was gymnasts before CrossFit. And those people were incredibly fit.

1759
01:52:30.08 --> 01:52:38.08
But CrossFit popularized those activities and those exercises more than anybody else was able to.

1760
01:52:38.08 --> 01:52:43.08
I mean, CrossFit is popular. And jujitsu is popular.

1761
01:52:43.08 --> 01:52:51.08
I mean, if you look at the number of jujitsu schools in CrossFit boxes in the country, they're probably the same growth pattern.

1762
01:52:51.08 --> 01:52:59.08
So, I definitely give CrossFit credit for bringing that kind of well balanced fitness to the forefront.

1763
01:52:59.08 --> 01:53:08.08
And I think the programming, you know, is fine. For me, it's a little bit too random. I like stuff to be a little bit more schedule.

1764
01:53:08.08 --> 01:53:13.08
I guess you could say, and sometimes I need more volume than what they have.

1765
01:53:13.08 --> 01:53:23.08
And I think you need more focus to get really good at some things. You need to, you need to do a more often than the the the straight CrossFit would prescribe.

1766
01:53:23.08 --> 01:53:32.08
I think it, you know, now people realize, you know, for a while they kind of held the line of like, no, all you need to do is what it says to do on the CrossFit workout of the day.

1767
01:53:32.08 --> 01:53:39.08
Just like in the beginning, jujitsu, Gracie jujitsu said, all you need to do is just do Gracie jujitsu.

1768
01:53:39.08 --> 01:53:50.08
And clearly both those attitudes are wrong. You know, what you really need to do is get that base and then open your mind, open your mind up.

1769
01:53:50.08 --> 01:53:57.08
And you get to know yourself what your, you get to know your own physicality after a while.

1770
01:53:57.08 --> 01:54:04.08
And then you know what your weaknesses are and you know what hurts you and you know what you can do more of and you know what you should do less of.

1771
01:54:04.08 --> 01:54:12.08
So I think that as a base, you know, like if someone just randomly says, you know, hey, I never worked out before what should I do.

1772
01:54:12.08 --> 01:54:20.08
I think CrossFit is a fine place to point them. You know, there's some other really good stuff out there, but you know, if you, it CrossFit's a good one.

1773
01:54:20.08 --> 01:54:24.08
And I think it's a good starting point. It's going to teach you the basics of squats and pull ups and tips.

1774
01:54:24.08 --> 01:54:28.08
And there's going to be a million people that are going to say, they don't really teach you Olympic lifting properly.

1775
01:54:28.08 --> 01:54:36.08
And you need to learn better form. I get it, right? Don't. If you want to learn to be an Olympic lifter, CrossFit is not going to be the best place to learn to be an Olympic lifter.

1776
01:54:36.08 --> 01:54:38.08
You need to go get an Olympic lifting coach.

1777
01:54:38.08 --> 01:54:42.08
If you want to be a great gymnast, you need to get a gymnast, excote.

1778
01:54:42.08 --> 01:54:51.08
But if you want an introduction to stuff, a basic introduction, then I think it's a solid, and again, I think you need to give it credit for what it did.

1779
01:54:51.08 --> 01:55:02.08
And then most importantly, you need to keep an open mind that things change and you will, you have to change.

1780
01:55:02.08 --> 01:55:09.08
So we all have to change and adapt and grow and evolve such that you can become better. So that's my opinion.

1781
01:55:09.08 --> 01:55:13.08
Yeah, the CrossFit undeniably, what it did is,

1782
01:55:13.08 --> 01:55:23.08
it took working out in some CrossFit workouts can be hard. I did CrossFit for a little bit, and even for someone who's like, in pretty good shape, like they can be hard.

1783
01:55:23.08 --> 01:55:37.08
And what an element of CrossFit that I'm not sure if this was intended from the beginning, but it got this way quick is kind of the group or the environment, you know.

1784
01:55:37.08 --> 01:55:46.08
So what it did was it turned it into act now, it's a sport, it's a straight up sport now. And really all it is is exercising.

1785
01:55:46.08 --> 01:55:52.08
The sport of exercising, being who the guy who wins the CrossFit games, what's he called the fitness guy.

1786
01:55:52.08 --> 01:56:01.08
So it brought fitness into this more of an activity to do rather than, okay, you got to do this short, you got to work out,

1787
01:56:01.08 --> 01:56:10.08
it made it into like an activity, like boom, and not just, okay, I'm going to go do some easy stuff with, you know, the girls on the weekend. It's, it's for real, you know, like, a hard workout,

1788
01:56:10.08 --> 01:56:21.08
and to put you through, you get in a group and across with situation, and they're going to be yelling supporting you, and it's way easier to stick with a workout program when you have people supporting you.

1789
01:56:21.08 --> 01:56:26.08
And they support you, like, for real support you. They're yelling at you, they're making a fish off all this stuff.

1790
01:56:26.08 --> 01:56:32.08
And you're way more likely to achieve success rather than someone's like, oh, here, you're going to make it to the gym today. Oh, yeah, maybe maybe not, or whatever.

1791
01:56:32.08 --> 01:56:45.08
And they give you good guidance. So again, it made it made fitness, what I'm, quote, fitness be popular, you know, this is cool thing, you know, and a community, you know, in a way that I don't, it's,

1792
01:56:45.08 --> 01:56:51.08
I mean, like you said, there's, there was already some of these, but they're like, okay, body building and, you know,

1793
01:56:51.08 --> 01:56:58.08
maybe some aerobics, but it didn't have that sense of community like, yeah, it's so much more part. I mean, you look at a company like Rogue Fitness.

1794
01:56:58.08 --> 01:57:06.08
Yeah, I mean, they didn't exist, I don't know, five years ago, but like, I, my old squat rack thing was ancient, right?

1795
01:57:06.08 --> 01:57:10.08
And it was kind of hard to get back in the day, you want to squat rack now boom,

1796
01:57:10.08 --> 01:57:21.08
broke fitness is a boom, oh, there you go. Yeah, they're going to send it to you. It's going to show up at your house in three days and they're selling hundreds of thousands of them. I'm sure.

1797
01:57:21.08 --> 01:57:26.08
And why is that? They're selling rings. They're selling boxes for boxes of bumper plates.

1798
01:57:26.08 --> 01:57:43.08
You used to be, you'd never see them. Like, I had bumper plates in the, why were I grew up, you know, and there was, you know, two guys that would actually Olympic left and you go, oh, wow, that's cool, but never in the gym. Now you go to, almost any gym now. No, no,

1799
01:57:43.08 --> 01:57:56.08
I almost, I shouldn't say that because the 24 hour fitness type global gyms. Oh, do that. Oh, yeah, I haven't been in one of the long time. It's kind of you. Yeah, yeah, it's all over all of the earth.

1800
01:57:56.08 --> 01:58:07.08
And there's over here in the, I still have 24 minutes, finish membership. I'll go there, you know, from time to time. Yeah, all of them have straight up, you know, protein, Greg. Yeah.

1801
01:58:07.08 --> 01:58:15.08
He's a trainer and he's at the, the Balbo and one big full on bread. You want to get a career cross been on you can go to 24 hours and it's worth more crowded.

1802
01:58:15.08 --> 01:58:31.08
It's different, the culture is different, which is a big part of CrossFit as well, but facility wise. Oh, yeah, bumpers all up in there. Yeah, all that too. That's, that's all thanks across. Right. Yeah, that's exactly your point. Yeah, good deal.

1803
01:58:31.08 --> 01:58:41.08
Mm. Next question. Any tips on learning about indirect communication would be handy for business or parenting.

1804
01:58:41.08 --> 01:58:55.08
Got another parent. I got a million parenting questions. Yeah, see in a more voice. And like I was saying that that's kind of why you can't really just talk about some because there's actually, if you want to quantify the parenting questions is infinity question.

1805
01:58:55.08 --> 01:59:05.08
There's no end to the parenting question. Because it's just so ambiguous. I don't even know. I mean, really what line is the bottom line is parenting is leadership. So the principles can be applied.

1806
01:59:05.08 --> 01:59:23.08
Yeah, but there are some dynamics there and they're all in your own head. Yeah. That's where they are. They're in your own head is apparent. They're this emotional thing that you have stronger than you have it for any other person you're ever going to work with. And that is, you know, you want them to succeed more than anybody else.

1807
01:59:23.08 --> 01:59:31.08
Yeah, you want them to succeed. You want them to be better. You want them to do better. You're all those things. And that's the dynamic that makes it tricky.

1808
01:59:31.08 --> 01:59:44.08
And then there's this weird dynamic too if the way they look at you and they either want to impress you or they want to rebel against you or they see you as being imposing on them. So there's just the other dynamics within the leadership.

1809
01:59:44.08 --> 01:59:58.08
And you can't really define that or that are very challenging. And again, I can't judge whether I've been successful yet because I only have my oldest daughter is 16, youngest daughter is six.

1810
01:59:58.08 --> 02:00:04.08
And then I have a daughter and another daughter, some of the middle. And then I know that they're specific mistakes that I have made.

1811
02:00:04.08 --> 02:00:21.08
And I, you know, then mistakes like what does that mean? You know, I mean, of course, you know, mistakes if you go too extreme, but because really success or I don't say success, but really driven people people who are just, you know how you get somebody who's just driven.

1812
02:00:21.08 --> 02:00:41.08
But it's usually, usually because some need, some during development, wasn't fulfilled. And I'm not saying, and you can't even say it's a bad thing because as a result, they're driven because psychologically it's like a need that needs to be fulfilled. So since that little cup

1813
02:00:41.08 --> 02:01:10.08
means kind of empty a little bit, they're trying to fill it with all these other things because life went on new skills, new developments, new situations. And they're still trying to fill that little psychological cup and it's manifesting in this other way, you know, through business through, you know, being maybe seal Gigi to champion, you know, whatever it may be, but typically, and I'm saying every single time, I'm sure there's exceptions or maybe there's not exceptions. I don't know, but nonetheless, you can usually find

1814
02:01:10.08 --> 02:01:27.08
some need that went on fulfilled somewhere for people who are super driven. So if you made a mistake parenting, is was that really a mistake? You know, in that kind of situation? So like, the point is it's so ambiguous, you know, you think you've been like, what is a successful parent?

1815
02:01:27.08 --> 02:01:37.08
Yeah, I mean, unless my point is that's why I don't want to talk to people about parenting because I don't know, I don't feel like an authority on it, that should be giving instruction.

1816
02:01:37.08 --> 02:01:55.08
Yeah, it's hard to even how can you be? I mean, I think I'm doing an okay job. Well, yeah, so you figure if they're not in jail or super addicted to like drugs or something like this or then you can say, okay, I'm, I think I think in my opinion, I'm within the compilience of being a successful.

1817
02:01:55.08 --> 02:02:11.08
And you know what since we're talking about it, you see some kids, I've known kids, you know, kids I grew up with with nice parents and all that and they go off the rails. And that's really skinned you. You do blame the parents. I mean, I don't know.

1818
02:02:11.08 --> 02:02:31.08
Oh, in my opinion, it's because of the parents. Yes, but that's not the question of do you blame the parents? I don't know. We got a question on here about a nature of nurture. So I'm going to talk about that here in a minute, but indirect communication. Let's get back to this. So in direct communication is obviously extremely powerful. It's also tricky to pull off.

1819
02:02:31.08 --> 02:02:49.08
Because you can't let your emotions show when you can't just speak your mind. You have to think about what you're going to say. You have to think about how it will be received and understood by the person or by the people that you're talking to.

1820
02:02:49.08 --> 02:03:08.08
You've got to put yourself into their shoes and hear it from their perspective and that's really hard to do. And the other piece about this, another piece to think about if you're trying to improve your indirect communication, go into your conversations with a goal.

1821
02:03:08.08 --> 02:03:23.08
Not just a goal of the conversation itself, but a strategic goal of what you're trying to accomplish, a commander's intent. Why are you having this conversation? What is the end game?

1822
02:03:23.08 --> 02:03:39.08
What are you trying to make happen? Keep that in mind as you talk to this person or this group of people and then read and react to see how you're saying and how much what you're saying is leading to the end state that you're looking for.

1823
02:03:39.08 --> 02:04:03.08
Because sometimes we just think about the conversation itself and the conversation itself doesn't matter. What are you trying to do in the end state? It's like we talked about before a few podcasts ago. The argument that you're having, whether you're right or whether you're wrong, doesn't matter. What matters is the end state where you're trying to get this to be. How are you trying to influence this person?

1824
02:04:03.08 --> 02:04:13.08
Remember that the best way to win is for your opponent to not even realize that there's a debate. That's the best way to win.

1825
02:04:13.08 --> 02:04:33.08
And you get some people instinctively counter everything that you say. They have a response, they have a thing, they've got a counter everything that you say. Don't do that. If you want to work on your indirect communication skills, absorb what they're saying.

1826
02:04:33.08 --> 02:04:57.08
The best way to get better at indirect communication is to listen. Listen, not talk but listen. And as a matter of fact, when you sit back and you let people talk, you're progressing so much because most people don't want to listen. Most people want to run their mouths.

1827
02:04:57.08 --> 02:05:05.08
And if you ever find yourself running your mouth, you should put yourself in check because you're given away too much information.

1828
02:05:05.08 --> 02:05:19.08
And so you want to listen. You want to try to actually understand what they're saying. And here's another good one. If you don't understand what they're saying, just ask them to explain it again.

1829
02:05:19.08 --> 02:05:37.08
Can you explain that to me again? I don't understand. What that implies that I want to understand. It implies that I'm doing my best to understand. It implies that if I don't understand, I'm going to be frank enough with you to tell you that is how you get better at indirect communication.

1830
02:05:37.08 --> 02:05:51.08
The more you listen to somebody, the better you understand their position. And when you know where someone's position is, the better you can maneuver onto that position.

1831
02:05:51.08 --> 02:05:56.08
The better you can get to a flank, the better you can make adaptations.

1832
02:05:56.08 --> 02:06:05.08
The better tactics you have to win.

1833
02:06:05.08 --> 02:06:09.08
And that's how you get better at indirect communication.

1834
02:06:09.08 --> 02:06:21.08
Yeah, you mentioned how you don't, like if you don't listen and you know how you failed to put yourself in the other person's shoes, right?

1835
02:06:21.08 --> 02:06:26.08
This thing called the curse of knowledge, right? So let's say I'm this high level CEO.

1836
02:06:26.08 --> 02:06:40.08
Sometimes we tend to forget how it is to not be the high level CEO or how it, we forget how it is to not know everything we know. That's a curse of knowledge. Like the knowledge basically blocks you from identifying someone who doesn't know.

1837
02:06:40.08 --> 02:06:56.08
So and that goes into these weird details. When you get enough knowledge, certain significant knowledge becomes common sense to you. But meanwhile, everyone else, it's not. So you just habitually or unconsciously, you might skip over it.

1838
02:06:56.08 --> 02:07:01.08
Meanwhile, they don't really understand and then you're just like, I don't know what I'm doing wrong kind of thing.

1839
02:07:01.08 --> 02:07:03.08
I'll go to the curse of knowledge.

1840
02:07:03.08 --> 02:07:04.08
You gotta watch out for that.

1841
02:07:04.08 --> 02:07:09.08
Gotta watch out for the curse of knowledge, yes.

1842
02:07:09.08 --> 02:07:11.08
I think that's a good time for one more.

1843
02:07:11.08 --> 02:07:13.08
One more last question.

1844
02:07:13.08 --> 02:07:15.08
Juckle.

1845
02:07:15.08 --> 02:07:19.08
What is more important in being successful at achieving your goals?

1846
02:07:19.08 --> 02:07:22.08
Nature or nurture?

1847
02:07:22.08 --> 02:07:30.08
Okay. So this is the classic question of nature versus nurture.

1848
02:07:30.08 --> 02:07:37.08
And in my opinion, it's neither.

1849
02:07:37.08 --> 02:07:45.08
And my whole life, I've seen people from every different strata.

1850
02:07:45.08 --> 02:07:54.08
In the sealed teams, you had everybody had Ivy League kids with a silver spoon and you had former gang bangers and hood rats.

1851
02:07:54.08 --> 02:08:01.08
And at the same time, you had prep school kids and kids from blue collar families and everybody in between.

1852
02:08:01.08 --> 02:08:08.08
There was kids with the big strong families that were really, really close.

1853
02:08:08.08 --> 02:08:10.08
And you had kids with no families.

1854
02:08:10.08 --> 02:08:13.08
Kids that were pampered and kids that were abused.

1855
02:08:13.08 --> 02:08:15.08
Everything. We had everything.

1856
02:08:15.08 --> 02:08:27.08
And in all of those different groups, there were some people that were successful and got the job done and some people that were unsuccessful and couldn't get it done.

1857
02:08:27.08 --> 02:08:31.08
And in working with businesses now, I see the same thing.

1858
02:08:31.08 --> 02:08:35.08
People from every walk of life from the bottom to the top.

1859
02:08:35.08 --> 02:08:41.08
And I've seen every type of those different types of people be successful.

1860
02:08:41.08 --> 02:08:47.08
So to me, it's not about nature or nurture.

1861
02:08:47.08 --> 02:08:51.08
It's about choice.

1862
02:08:51.08 --> 02:08:57.08
The people that are successful decide they are going to be successful.

1863
02:08:57.08 --> 02:09:00.08
They make that choice.

1864
02:09:00.08 --> 02:09:02.08
And they make other choices.

1865
02:09:02.08 --> 02:09:04.08
They decide to study hard.

1866
02:09:04.08 --> 02:09:06.08
They choose to work hard.

1867
02:09:06.08 --> 02:09:13.08
They choose to be the first person to get to work and the last person to go home.

1868
02:09:13.08 --> 02:09:20.08
They choose to take on the hard jobs and take on the challenges.

1869
02:09:20.08 --> 02:09:27.08
They decide they're going to lead when no one else will.

1870
02:09:27.08 --> 02:09:33.08
They choose who they're going to hang around with and be associated with.

1871
02:09:33.08 --> 02:09:39.08
And they choose who they're going to emulate.

1872
02:09:39.08 --> 02:09:45.08
These people choose to become who they want to become.

1873
02:09:45.08 --> 02:09:50.08
They aren't inhibited by nature or nurture.

1874
02:09:50.08 --> 02:09:55.08
They overcome both.

1875
02:09:55.08 --> 02:09:57.08
And I'll tell you something else.

1876
02:09:57.08 --> 02:10:00.08
It's never too late to make that choice.

1877
02:10:00.08 --> 02:10:05.08
You're never too old to decide where you're going to focus your efforts.

1878
02:10:05.08 --> 02:10:13.08
And push to make the most out of every situation.

1879
02:10:13.08 --> 02:10:26.08
So to me, it's not about what you've been through and where you were.

1880
02:10:26.08 --> 02:10:31.08
It's about where you're going.

1881
02:10:31.08 --> 02:10:34.08
And it's about the choices that you make.

1882
02:10:34.08 --> 02:10:37.08
It's about choosing.

1883
02:10:37.08 --> 02:10:42.08
Choose to make yourself smarter and stronger and healthier.

1884
02:10:42.08 --> 02:10:54.08
Choose to work out and study and eat good food and keep your mind clean.

1885
02:10:54.08 --> 02:11:04.08
Don't let nature or nurture make you.

1886
02:11:04.08 --> 02:11:11.08
Choose to make yourself.

1887
02:11:11.08 --> 02:11:16.08
Choose to work out and study and study.

1888
02:11:16.08 --> 02:11:21.08
I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1889
02:11:21.08 --> 02:11:29.08
So, tell you, troopers out there on the front lines of the battlefield,

1890
02:11:29.08 --> 02:11:33.08
on the front lines of life.

1891
02:11:33.08 --> 02:11:36.08
Thanks for joining us in this conversation.

1892
02:11:36.08 --> 02:11:40.08
Thanks for listening and subscribing and go crank out or review on iTunes.

1893

1894
02:11:45.08 --> 02:11:50.08
Let everybody know that we are here.

1895
02:11:50.08 --> 02:12:01.08
And we are moving forward together into the fray.

1896
02:12:01.08 --> 02:12:09.08
And tell them all that we are not scared of the dark.

1897
02:12:09.08 --> 02:12:15.08
Because we are here and we are bringing the light.

1898
02:12:15.08 --> 02:12:19.08
Thanks for connecting with us through the interwebs.

1899
02:12:19.08 --> 02:12:24.08
And if you don't know on Twitter,

1900
02:12:24.08 --> 02:12:29.08
at Jocco Willink and Echo is at Echo Charles.

1901
02:12:29.08 --> 02:12:33.08
We also have the Facy book.

1902
02:12:33.08 --> 02:12:38.08
And with that, what is it? Slash Jocco Willink?

1903
02:12:38.08 --> 02:12:40.08
The whole way, your...

1904
02:12:40.08 --> 02:12:42.08
Yeah, I don't know.

1905
02:12:42.08 --> 02:12:44.08
I'm Jocco Willink.

1906
02:12:44.08 --> 02:12:46.08
And then we have the podcast one.

1907
02:12:46.08 --> 02:12:49.08
Right, that's Facebook.com slash Jocco podcast.

1908
02:12:49.08 --> 02:12:51.08
There you go.

1909
02:12:51.08 --> 02:12:55.08
And get on there, give us some feedback, give us some questions.

1910
02:12:55.08 --> 02:12:59.08
Let us know what you think of what's going on here.

1911
02:12:59.08 --> 02:13:05.08
And then we got companies that support us, support them.

1912
02:13:05.08 --> 02:13:06.08
It's true.

1913
02:13:06.08 --> 02:13:10.08
For the Facebook thing too, we don't really post that much on there.

1914
02:13:10.08 --> 02:13:14.08
But what we do post and will post is going to be quality stuff.

1915
02:13:14.08 --> 02:13:20.08
It won't be just like, you know, just a bunch of stuff for quantity content.

1916
02:13:20.08 --> 02:13:22.08
Yeah, I haven't quite got down my system.

1917
02:13:22.08 --> 02:13:28.08
I've definitely, we went every question that is posted on either of the Facebooks.

1918
02:13:28.08 --> 02:13:32.08
I am definitely taking in and putting in into the question bank.

1919
02:13:32.08 --> 02:13:36.08
It doesn't mean it's going to get answered on the podcast because we don't have time to answer

1920
02:13:36.08 --> 02:13:37.08
thousands of questions.

1921
02:13:37.08 --> 02:13:38.08
Yeah.

1922
02:13:38.08 --> 02:13:39.08
But I'm definitely looking at it.

1923
02:13:39.08 --> 02:13:40.08
I'm reading it.

1924
02:13:40.08 --> 02:13:47.08
Sometimes if I see a trend of the same question, boom, I see it four, five, six times.

1925
02:13:47.08 --> 02:13:49.08
Unless it's about parenting.

1926
02:13:49.08 --> 02:13:55.08
But if I see something four or five times, hey, I'm going to throw it on there.

1927
02:13:55.08 --> 02:13:59.08
And we'll talk about it.

1928
02:13:59.08 --> 02:14:02.08
Some of my just answer because I know hey, you know what no one cares about this question.

1929
02:14:02.08 --> 02:14:07.08
But you, whoever you are, somebody's going to give you a short answer or maybe it's a long answer.

1930
02:14:07.08 --> 02:14:11.08
And so yeah, if you get on there, I'm looking at it.

1931
02:14:11.08 --> 02:14:14.08
I haven't quite got down my system for Facebook yet.

1932
02:14:14.08 --> 02:14:18.08
I only just recently am starting to figure it out.

1933
02:14:18.08 --> 02:14:21.08
The different parts of it because I've never used it before.

1934
02:14:21.08 --> 02:14:23.08
And I didn't use it that actively.

1935
02:14:23.08 --> 02:14:25.08
So I'm trying to get better at it.

1936
02:14:25.08 --> 02:14:27.08
But that's why Twitter is really easy for me.

1937
02:14:27.08 --> 02:14:28.08
It's like pretty straightforward.

1938
02:14:28.08 --> 02:14:29.08
Yeah, it's very straightforward.

1939
02:14:29.08 --> 02:14:32.08
Yeah, yeah, Facebook in Facebook's always changing as well.

1940
02:14:32.08 --> 02:14:38.08
But in regards to them, like, because what you do is like Twitter, you just like the page, right?

1941
02:14:38.08 --> 02:14:40.08
It's like follow me like you did follows.

1942
02:14:40.08 --> 02:14:43.08
But some pages menu, you follow it.

1943
02:14:43.08 --> 02:14:47.08
And then it's a bunch of stuff that it's like, and this is starting to be not that relevant.

1944
02:14:47.08 --> 02:14:49.08
Maybe once a week I'll see some relevant stuff.

1945
02:14:49.08 --> 02:14:56.08
So what I'm going to do is like anything I post is going to be very relevant or even like,

1946
02:14:56.08 --> 02:15:00.08
you know, like a, like a, you know, how we record before we start recording,

1947
02:15:00.08 --> 02:15:03.08
I might post some deleted scenes.

1948
02:15:03.08 --> 02:15:04.08
Oh, delete scenes.

1949
02:15:04.08 --> 02:15:05.08
Yeah, you were.

1950
02:15:05.08 --> 02:15:06.08
Does everyone sit a while.

1951
02:15:06.08 --> 02:15:08.08
So, you know, no harm no file if you just like it.

1952
02:15:08.08 --> 02:15:11.08
Even if you don't want to answer a question or ask question.

1953
02:15:11.08 --> 02:15:12.08
But please ask a question.

1954
02:15:12.08 --> 02:15:15.08
Yeah, and I'm trying to get to respond to some of the comments.

1955
02:15:15.08 --> 02:15:16.08
You know what I mean?

1956
02:15:16.08 --> 02:15:16.08
Yeah.

1957
02:15:16.08 --> 02:15:17.08
Try and get on there every once in a while.

1958
02:15:17.08 --> 02:15:18.08
Right.

1959
02:15:18.08 --> 02:15:21.08
Yeah, I think the Twitter is, is easier.

1960
02:15:21.08 --> 02:15:23.08
Just like how you said because it's just super simple.

1961
02:15:23.08 --> 02:15:23.08
Boom.

1962
02:15:23.08 --> 02:15:23.08
Boom.

1963
02:15:23.08 --> 02:15:23.08
Boom.

1964
02:15:23.08 --> 02:15:24.08
Boom.

1965
02:15:24.08 --> 02:15:24.08
Yeah.

1966
02:15:24.08 --> 02:15:26.08
But either way, they're both great.

1967
02:15:26.08 --> 02:15:28.08
On it.com slash jocco.

1968
02:15:28.08 --> 02:15:34.08
That's where you get your 10% off your supplements and their, their supplements are so good, man.

1969
02:15:34.08 --> 02:15:37.08
And I'm not super into supplements.

1970
02:15:37.08 --> 02:15:38.08
That's a thing.

1971
02:15:38.08 --> 02:15:43.08
But the ones that I take and you, it's hard to tell the difference a lot of times between

1972
02:15:43.08 --> 02:15:46.08
brands, but you can tell the difference with these brands.

1973
02:15:46.08 --> 02:15:52.08
And like the worry bar, for example, in my opinion, that's one of the most genius things.

1974
02:15:52.08 --> 02:15:53.08
So many things.

1975
02:15:53.08 --> 02:15:54.08
It's like beef jerky.

1976
02:15:54.08 --> 02:15:57.08
I remember when beef jerky, or not when it came out of it.

1977
02:15:57.08 --> 02:15:58.08
No, not even close.

1978
02:15:58.08 --> 02:16:02.08
But when you saw beef jerky as someone who's into protein, you know, when you're,

1979
02:16:02.08 --> 02:16:05.08
I don't know, when I turn like 15, 16, started like in beef jerky was

1980
02:16:05.08 --> 02:16:06.08
Dang that is dope.

1981
02:16:06.08 --> 02:16:07.08
We're in the embedded that.

1982
02:16:07.08 --> 02:16:07.08
We're in the embedded that.

1983
02:16:07.08 --> 02:16:08.08
I feel all the time.

1984
02:16:08.08 --> 02:16:09.08
Yeah.

1985
02:16:09.08 --> 02:16:11.08
So consider the warrior bar is like,

1986
02:16:11.08 --> 02:16:12.08
Yeah, way better.

1987
02:16:12.08 --> 02:16:14.08
It's like beef jerky, but.

1988
02:16:14.08 --> 02:16:17.08
But it's super awesome.

1989
02:16:17.08 --> 02:16:20.08
Anyway, so anyway, that my point is the stuff on it is is good.

1990
02:16:20.08 --> 02:16:22.08
And you get 10% off.

1991
02:16:22.08 --> 02:16:23.08
So that's like a no brainer.

1992
02:16:23.08 --> 02:16:25.08
Yeah, on it.com slash jacquo.

1993
02:16:25.08 --> 02:16:26.08
There you go.

1994
02:16:26.08 --> 02:16:30.08
And then the Amazon click through you go to the podcast website, which is

1995
02:16:30.08 --> 02:16:33.08
jacqupodcast.com or jacquo store.com, either one.

1996
02:16:33.08 --> 02:16:36.08
And you click through to the Amazon before you do shopping.

1997
02:16:36.08 --> 02:16:38.08
And you can passively support.

1998
02:16:38.08 --> 02:16:39.08
Well, slightly.

1999
02:16:39.08 --> 02:16:40.08
Same.

2000
02:16:40.08 --> 02:16:40.08
Same.

2001
02:16:40.08 --> 02:16:40.08
Same.

2002
02:16:40.08 --> 02:16:42.08
I actively pretty bad.

2003
02:16:42.08 --> 02:16:43.08
Does it cost you a click?

2004
02:16:43.08 --> 02:16:44.08
Yeah, exactly.

2005
02:16:44.08 --> 02:16:47.08
And then a lot of people asked for the donation link.

2006
02:16:47.08 --> 02:16:49.08
And that's on jacqupodcast.com to paypal.

2007
02:16:49.08 --> 02:16:52.08
Yeah, to see we use paypal, it was simple.

2008
02:16:52.08 --> 02:16:54.08
But it's on there nonetheless.

2009
02:16:54.08 --> 02:16:58.08
And you know, for everyone that does that man, it's so cool to be like,

2010
02:16:58.08 --> 02:17:00.08
It's kind of just liked what you're saying.

2011
02:17:00.08 --> 02:17:02.08
And he was like, here's somebody.

2012
02:17:02.08 --> 02:17:03.08
That is.

2013
02:17:03.08 --> 02:17:04.08
That's it.

2014
02:17:04.08 --> 02:17:04.08
That's it.

2015
02:17:04.08 --> 02:17:05.08
That's how we play.

2016
02:17:05.08 --> 02:17:06.08
I'll blow it away.

2017
02:17:06.08 --> 02:17:06.08
Oh, no way.

2018
02:17:06.08 --> 02:17:06.08
Oh, no way.

2019
02:17:06.08 --> 02:17:06.08
Oh, no way.

2020
02:17:06.08 --> 02:17:07.08
Oh, no way.

2021
02:17:07.08 --> 02:17:07.08
Oh, no way.

2022
02:17:07.08 --> 02:17:08.08
Oh, no way.

2023
02:17:08.08 --> 02:17:09.08
Oh, no way.

2024
02:17:09.08 --> 02:17:09.08
Oh, no way.

2025
02:17:09.08 --> 02:17:10.08
Oh, no way.

2026
02:17:10.08 --> 02:17:10.08
Oh, no way.

2027
02:17:10.08 --> 02:17:10.08
Oh, no way.

2028
02:17:10.08 --> 02:17:13.08
Oh, no way.

2029
02:17:13.08 --> 02:17:14.08
Oh, no way.

2030
02:17:14.08 --> 02:17:15.08
Oh, no way.

2031
02:17:15.08 --> 02:17:18.08
Go to the trailer.

2032
02:17:18.08 --> 02:17:19.08
Get a shirt on jacquo store.com.

2033
02:17:19.08 --> 02:17:20.08
It's real.

2034
02:17:20.08 --> 02:17:20.08
One has jacquo's head on it with the word good backwards.

2035
02:17:20.08 --> 02:17:22.08
So when you look in the mirror, it tells you good.

2036
02:17:22.08 --> 02:17:23.08
This is going bad.

2037
02:17:23.08 --> 02:17:24.08
It's always so good.

2038
02:17:24.08 --> 02:17:25.08
It comes right.

2039
02:17:25.08 --> 02:17:26.08
There you go.

2040
02:17:26.08 --> 02:17:27.08
You've been in a real.

2041
02:17:27.08 --> 02:17:28.08
It's Mr. Grizzen mugs as well.

2042
02:17:28.08 --> 02:17:29.08
Anyway, there it is.

2043
02:17:29.08 --> 02:17:30.08
And there they are.

2044
02:17:30.08 --> 02:17:31.08
Nice.

2045
02:17:31.08 --> 02:17:33.08
And also, if you want some more of this stuff,

2046
02:17:33.08 --> 02:17:38.08
I reference it several times tonight, but buddy of mine.

2047
02:17:38.08 --> 02:17:42.08
it's available in a hardcover, Kindle or audiobook.

2048
02:17:42.08 --> 02:17:47.08
And we actually read the audiobook, so if you want to hear us talk

2049
02:17:47.08 --> 02:17:51.08
and more, there's eight hours you can get yourself into

2050
02:17:51.08 --> 02:18:02.08
war stories and leadership and it's good times and finally, and most importantly,

2051
02:18:02.08 --> 02:18:09.08
thanks for making the choice. The choice to make yourself better, faster,

2052
02:18:09.08 --> 02:18:16.08
stronger, smarter, healthier, and of course, thanks to everyone

2053
02:18:16.08 --> 02:18:29.08
for making the choice to get up, get going, get aggressive, and get after it.

2054
02:18:29.08 --> 02:18:34.08
So until next time, this is Jocco and Echo.

2055
02:18:34.08 --> 02:18:52.08
Out.
