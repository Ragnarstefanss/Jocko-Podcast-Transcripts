but they don't have the leadership knowledge so that's what's beneficial about things like this podcast like extreme worship like that got to me leadership like putting this information where people can actually read it and understand it they can study because they know their job they know their technical field you know that's another thing with EF overwatch right now is like we're bringing in people that don't necessarily have the technical skill inside of a field but they have the leadership experience and it's a lot easier to teach someone a technical skill that it is to teach the leadership because to get leadership the only way you get better leadership is leadership. but you'll like you'll kind of give me my do like sympathy even with what you say like you'll you'll sympathize like you'll be like hey you're like man that is a bummer or whatever you know whatever the words you say well the thing is if I didn't do that then I you have you won't want to listen to what I'm actually about tell you to do yeah and he's talking about this and this and like being Greg Trin or like not really saying that much stuff he didn't be like two of his excuses um that you know since he's like sort out of shape right or since he's actually going to wait to get back and shape right for him that's what we're asking but when you ask it direct like that it sounds dumb you know and so an example is like if you like if you're a character you know you guys like you use a word wrong or say a word pronounced a word wrong like the guy who's so quick to always correct you in front of people doesn't matter whatever you know you're a character usually those characters people those character people are they're right it's so good now that this you know charity whatever gets the help that they want kind of thing you know what's you know what people underestimate all the time people underestimate how well other people can see what's going on they say I get personally that I see people I say man do you really think that anybody you're fooling anyone and it usually happens it usually happens with people that are well they're obviously they're smart and now you have people doing things that they shouldn't be doing and and and and and I don't necessarily mean they're doing something illegal I'm saying they're doing things that don't support the strategic goals of the company and it's a problem but as those companies grow what they don't realize is just like this book says you have more tools that you can put into place you've got it you've got to communications department inside your company whose job is internal communications so you could be making what you could be making videos and explain to people what's going on and given an update you can you can do all those things you have that capability you have VTCs right you got video calls you can make you you've got subordinate leadership that can go out there and get in the field and make things known so there's a way to overcome these problems if you address them if you don't address them So dichotomy is kind of like rambo where like people are like, oh, I love the dichotomy love, but but the people who know know that first blood is the real movie is the real O.G. One that rambo's not better. unconsciously they perceive it unconsciously or consciously you know it's like you're like I have a dog my dog can kind of know what I'm thinking and that's a damn dog with a brain like a size of a walnut or whatever how big a big a dog's brain is right not big my dog can't speak English I think you posted something like a written thing about how you're like, hey, today's like one of those days where I need more recovery or something like that, basically indicating that you're going to take a rest day or whatever. yeah you know that's a bummer because the thing is I don't like mispronouncing words and yet the corrective measures for not mispronouncing words is for instance if we're going and I'll listen I'm saying something wrong and I'm like hold on let me go back let me interrupt one of my thought pattern let me interrupt what I'm saying to try and figure out if I pronounce this thing right or wrong I lean towards it's better to just flow and get corrected later and then now we have an anger situation now they might listen anything that you're gonna say and now we might ruin a relationship based on the fact that we went too hardcore now to Sam's point if you don't ever indicate any kind of truth then you just let a person continue on a path that bad for them and is bad for their in this case they're wait well and that's not good either but the key component if you have tact and you build a relationship because basically I think I had this conversation with LaFa little while ago you know when you're dealing with someone when you're dealing with a team you're either forwarding and improving the relationship or you know you could be neutral or you're making it go backwards what we want to be doing is improving the relationship at a minimum we want to remain neutral and every other aspect of going backwards in a relationship is bad so if we're business partners and we have a we have a discussion about something I want the result of that discussion to be that our relationship improved and if you live your life thinking that guess what at a minimum people are going to someone's going to know that this is a front if you do that it's kind of like when I told the I've told a bunch of soldiers officers that they had a psycho path in their pontoon and like every if you're if you got 40 you know the ear boss or what someone who outranks you it's not necessarily it's not in the military I don't think but it's like you know this it's like I have a few more letters in my title or something like that or a few more yeah my bus I should do a better job like that guy who emailed me that I'm sorry the last one is unselfishness unselfishness is the study devoidance of caring for or providing for one's own comfort or advantage at the expense of others anytime that you as the leader are getting the good deal while your people are getting shafted they notice it and they don't like it they don't like it at all But if you're part of a group involuntarily, you know, so, you know, like, the group's going to be less cohesive if you're like proclaiming that, hey, this is the group. so so Greg sort of leaves and leaves it at that and I'm sitting there like kind of looking at him and I was like but just like all right that's that's not true you know yeah all right leadership techniques it is important to note that in small units the leader can influence and direct his men through close personal contact whereas in large units he must rely in great measure upon his staff and subordinate commanders to a system in making his leadership effective the larger the unit the more complex the problems of leadership but the greater the greater become the means available to the commander to assist him in the exercise of his leadership so as you grow problems get more complex but you end up with you have more people you have more tools the larger unit commander must consider carefully the leadership aspect of all basic policies which he prescribes your tolerance You know, some people will be like, they don't like, they start training and they don't like it. no we're not doing that so that's it loyalty trying build that loyalty up and down the chain of command sympathy is the capacity of sharing the feelings of those with whom one is associated you know I don't like talk about feelings very much actually you don't but the thing in practice like you do that surprisingly good and I don't want to say surprising and I'm there man is I'm like can you hear yourself like that's not even a believable thing you know can you be so exhausted that you can't talk afterwards can you do that especially I'm sure you can if you're ran a foot I don't know hundred I put some, um, like MCT oil and coconut oil, you know, like just a little bit, not like too much with ever. yes they go you know you have this department that they don't know anything about software or nothing like that they don't know about you know so if I'm like so exhausted from training not only is that experience kind of diminished then I'm too exhausted to have like a good conversation go D. He he said it way more like could you laugh at him I would bro if you I wanted him to yeah you're all going to get your own little leadership techniques and what's I'm telling you where I'm really lucky is I've worked with so many different leaders that I just don't know my techniques I say hey you know what's a good thing to do here my buddy bill you stabbing issue with us okay this is a good example when I said hey I'm trying to build a relationship with a boss that's why I'm going to act this way right that's different because that boss is going to say oh he's just trying to butter me up it's like so if I'm like so exhausted you know I like I like training and maybe from like like he's like has an analytical mind you know You know, I like to, you know, if you come at a problem, like, hey, that was my fault. it's like we won't run into miss understanding very often so it's a few years long about not training you did so well that was being without weakness you're talking about like he underestimating under people's reception now was hit that which he has obviously like we all do Because your ego is like, hey, I can't, like, I can't deal with this little, like, short coming in whatever way. no you know eight y'all's get back on the mat he got good quick to that and that's kind of part of the the whole picture you know it's like you're based on what do you think that he will he learned learned anything from you just by being your twin brother like no I have you man that's a rough situation to be in I think what's gonna happen here I mean if you way it out the only real solution is for you to kind of back away from that scenario you know what I mean so I kind of brought you in right made that's going to be that's not going to lead to that's not going to lead to the it's not going to lead to your spouse respecting and listening to what you're saying it's going to lead to your spouse saying oh you're a jerk you don't know how hard it is for me and then they say but uh I think it's black lies what is that but lying by by omission or whatever it's like you know you're telling the truth but you're leaving out stuff to kind of lead them in a certain direction or whatever to make them think certain stuff there's then there's that you know Not that they ever had, but they don't have egos where now, you know, one robot, he's like, hey, I want to be the leader and the other robot, they don't have it like that.
