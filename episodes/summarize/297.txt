Like, I know what jitsu has done for people in his situation, you know, and, uh, I actually should have pushed harder to like get him to training more, you know, like it just, I didn't, um, really shitty situation. And I was kind of like, not really, like the first pair of boots that I got were like, I was like, said me, you know, change these things. But I, I, I think, like, man, if he, if I hate to say like, like put the song, jitsu, but man, if he had started, like a little bit earlier and gotten back into that team type of atmosphere, I know what it could have done for him. and I we have like a room that's connected you know because we're working and like whatever day to of us be a dancer he's like bro he takes me about the good he goes he goes to a warfare and krill oil I was like, bro this is not amateur all the way what's up. I remember like when you think 30,000 more for 50,000 more, you're like, oh, I'm like, oh, I'm like, oh, I'm just a half a week more. I feel like the, the wormhole is closing, you know, like we've been in this wormhole and you can see the light in it, and it's like this and we're going, and we're, we're moving towards it, we're moving towards it and we're picking up speed and we've got to get through the wormhole before shots. So Lenny, I mean, that guy, really, he's one of the main reasons for our success and and our ability to do what we do because what I asked Lenny and you've heard me say as before, how many people know what you knew and he's like, hold bunch like, how many like how many knew England? You know, like, I'm, you know, it's hard for me to understand how like a piece of thread goes through that big piece of leather and how's that going to work and who's doing that? And then you had the people showing the videos with the like that smoke stuff coming out and being like, yeah, this is, you know, again, couldn't know the future. It's just like if you're like a a what do you call like a public figure like jockel. But it's still, uh, it's still crazy to say we're going to drive the same culture we drive in Maine and North Carolina, you know, and think through having the right people in place and processes and making sure that you get enough face time there and get them bought into what we're doing, um, from an extreme ownership perspective, you know, and it's going to take time to make all that happen. It was kind of a point where looking at the organizational structure as we're growing was like, we've got to have the right people in the right places if we're going to start doing shit like this. So the Cionkid Kim who's in his early 20s, Lenny spent hours upon hours, upon hours with him, teaching him over a three year period and and he passed and it sucks bad, you know, like I might, man, first time I broke down a long time, like losing him, he he meant the world to the company and to the people of origin and just was such a tremendous, tremendous asset. I was like, you know, my wife and I are, you know, like, blame around chips, chips, chips, chips, chips. And, I remember they got to a point where they asked me to stop saying, go clear this, because I was like, hey, if you go to a wall, I'll clear the shelves and people are like, okay, cool, people are posting videos of them just clearing shelves into cooler from wall, while freaking awesome. Like kind of like it's kind of like it's kind of weird. I was absolutely like weekly motivational speeches and shit, like not meant to be motivational, but like look at what you people are doing. And it's you know this you just said subscription you know you kind of like we're starting to go down that path but this is the one in my opinion this is where you subscribe because you don't want to get caught short without what you need. I look at a pair of boots and I think, man, that seems like a thing like it's going to be a problem. I had three or four friends, couple seals, maybe like a seal, doctor, medic, someone else sent me, you know, taxed email, whatever, saying like, hey, dude, you should make masks. What if like, you're about to like pound like half a container of Bucklova. And all of a sudden that's like goes on the little bit of a, you know, hesitation there because people, it shut down, you know, wasn't whatever. They were we actually, we actually the vitamin shop we exploded in because people, they were buying like, when you went into the stores like, wife, let's tell me. Uh, like, we, we would have recorded a podcast, but, uh, she, like, last minute thing and she only had a little bit of time. You know, the thing is is after, like after, you know, the whole national shutdown last year. And if we had the fund, those supply chains, which we did, which we did, we had the fund finding a new denim manufacturer and commit to massive amounts of denim to weave denim, you know, and in really secure the supply chain, like we played it, I think it was, I think by design, we played it well. Just to, that was good to like again in the bubonic plague phase of when, you know, when we started making the face shields that were going to hospitals that the hospitals couldn't get that they thought were absolutely critical at the time. I mean, I didn't think like people, I didn't think we're going to be affected by people not at bars, drinking off a tap. But it's like you know one of those things but we got to pay attention to the right thing. Yeah, big, the thing is it's almost like an inevitable when you think about where we need to go and how to get there, you know. You know, you think about blitz scaling to we have 210 employees, you know, over 2020 we hired another 40 employees, you know. I just, I literally like just chasing information, you know, reconnaissance, you know, and we discovered this guy and I told him what we wanted to do. I said, bro, look, man, it's hard to make geese like, um, this doesn't seem like a smart idea. She loves, she's like, oh, she's like, oh, she's listening to this podcast right now. I remember you and I would be talking and you'd be like, oh, you'd be like, what do you think? A week later, you're like, bro, if we can get people, like, scrolling engine. And, you know, we, you know, we, like, God and Nicole's fiance is from the Dominican.
