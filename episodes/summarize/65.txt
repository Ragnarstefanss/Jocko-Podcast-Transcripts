and and I remember that that bond that we had an in task unit bruiser you know so often you get what the seals are doing their thing and you got the support personnel that are running the radios and the C.B.s that run the cabinet they just do different stuff and they don't you know what was so awesome about task in bruiser was like you lined those trucks up and we know we're going out you know we're going out at operation and and if you were weren't if you weren't coming on the op I know you would you would always be out there you know out there shaking everybody's hands and talking to him and and not in a way of like you know not in a way that there was more bit right but in a way of like just the respects and knowledge that any time we're going out like any one time there may be there may be any of these guys that are all now may not become a back from this they may be coming back in a body back and and that we had to be ready for that at all the time because it was almost a daily daily thing and I just not you know for for you and the the support personnel the comms guys you know our our our radio when that route there these aren't seals and they're you know does it say hey we wrote a book that's having some impact but when you see the things that they're doing when they're implementing extreme ownership when they're using cover move and they're not focused on themselves but about the mission and work together as a team and and using decentralized community you know it's playing the why to their teams and and the results are amazing you know see that happen and and that's really you know that's really what it's all about for us I think is seeing that kind of impact so it's been awesome to see that and looking forward for that to continue to grow and expand it's reach across the globe you know we we talk about in the book we talk about work on the Iraqi soldiers and one of the hardest things obviously even if you took a great soldier but they don't speak the language you speak any of a language barrier that's a real problem so a lot of times in these teams what the book gives them what the extreme ownership gives them it gives them a a language common language to talk about the issues the leadership problems that they're having they can identify because how can you fight an enemy that you can identify so if you know if you don't know that hey our decentralized command is weak and if you don't know what that is and you can identify how can you fix it if you got a cover move to solve problems and work together but you don't know what that looks like or you don't even know what to call it how are you going to get it solved so that's one of the things that I notice when we show up at a company that already is using it and have read it they're immediately saying you know and we are our our zero four four four five club PT's that we're cranking out these awesome workouts and and we I mean all levels of athletes there's some really high in you know athletes or black credible and you know you did two players to to the you know just just some folks who've just started training or just started hitting the gym and encouraged to but podcast or whatnot and came out participating that and and walking you know jogging over to or walking back from those those workouts talking those leaders and people talking what would you do in this situation you know I remember having those conversations with people and you're helping them apply that stuff we've heard do social media so many of those people some of those specific conversations like I can't believe how good this word here's what's going on I'm not I'm not able to I just got a promotion you know based on this you know those kind of that kind of feedback we always talk about so I'm gonna be able to watch more you know that even thought I needed so ridiculous amount of weight that I'm carried and so we load up I mean I'm having a hard time even just you know picking this bag up put it in so we load up in our vehicles we drive we meet up with the Marines we're loading up into their big seven ton trucks that they took in and they put the troops in the back these huge vehicles and that that was they would kind of drive you on the outskirts of the bad areas on roads they cleared and hopefully you were protecting and you know in those in those vehicles from from the armor then we unloaded and we unloaded from the vehicles once we got to a point and just so everyone knows these are like madmax scenario vehicles that people that that people military guys had had put steel on the sides you know half in steel on the sides to protect from rounds sandbags on the floor you know just put sandbags all over the floor so it's not like when when when he's talking about an armored vehicle don't think of a tank through or a Bradley fighting vehicle he's talking about a madmax scenario big giant seven ton truck that it looks like a construction truck and so they did a really good job of of suckering us in on that on that first patrol because they said hey we're just going to send you guys out on a shake out patrol tonight and so a shake out patrol in the sealed teams means you're going to put your gear on you want to see how everything rides on your body you want to make sure that it's comfortable you want to make sure that there's no you know tags that are wearing on you or anything like that that's just a shake out patrol get your little hand signals make sure we're all good to go get to know each other a little bit it's just like a little it's basically like a little walk like like a little walk I mean if they think it's probably going to take a shake out patrol should probably take you know you know what I'm doing go back to the book right now here we go they were called legs or grunts to carry something was to hump it as when lieutenant Jimmy Cross humped his love for Martha up the hills and through the swamps almost everyone humped photographs in his wallet lieutenant cross carry two photographs of Martha as a first lieutenant and platoon leader Jimmy Cross carried a compass map code books binoculars and a 45 caliber pistol that weighed 2.9 pounds fully loaded he carried a strobe light and the responsibility for the lives of his men as an RTO Mitchell Sanders carried the PRC 25 radio a killer 26 pounds with its battery as a medic rat Kylie carried a canvis satchel filled with morphine and plasma and malaria tablets and surgical tape and comic books and all the things a medic must carry including mnms for especially bad wounds for a total weight of nearly 18 pounds as a big man therefore a machine gunner Henry Dobb Dobbins carried the m60 which weighed 23 pounds unloaded but which was almost always loaded in addition Dobbins carried between 10 15 pounds of ammunition draped in belts across his chest and shoulders they all carried ghosts when dark came they would move out single file across the meadows and pattys to their ambush coordinates where they would quietly set up the claymores and lie down and spend the night waiting in that section when I was reading that clearly this is very similar to the operations that you conducted a ton of which was they're called a manborses here and we call them sniper overwatches but the idea you know the idea for those of what was happening is very very similar you know you guys are patrolling out to a location just like you talked about setting up for remain over day or for the night how did you feel like you know you kind of talked about it but did you feel like you were ready for that stuff oh maybe it's the TV spots that we don't know we didn't do that either so word of mouth it is exactly and not you know for that that's the real testament I think for you know for me that we wrote a book that's resin with leaders that's helping them get better to lead better teams for people to to be better teammates and employ these concepts in extreme ownership you know when we see them you know the the fire service training that's going on you know and face firefighters are using that as they're they're training man in a conduct in these these training or we see police police units doing it we see businesses you know and some of them bring us in and have training some of them they're holding their own training they're buying that book and they're they're learning out of it yeah below your nose just that just how it is over there just it was all just everywhere good times I'm taking this back to the book they moved like mules by daylight they took sniper fire at night they were mortored but it was not battle it was just the endless march village to village without purpose nothing one or lost they marched for the sake of the march they plotted along slowly, dumbling, leaning forward against the heat, unthinking all blood and bone, simple grunts, soldiering with their legs, toiling up the hills and down into the patties and across the rivers and up and down again just pumping one step and then the next and then another but no volition no will because it was automatic it was anatomy and the war was entirely a matter of posture and courage the hump was everything a kind of inertia a kind of emptiness, a doneness of desire and intellect and conscious and hope and human sensibility their principles were in their feet their calculations were biological they had no sense of strategy or mission they searched the villages without knowing what to look for not caring kicking over jars of rice frisking children and old men blowing tunnels sometimes settings fires and sometimes not then forming up and moving on to the next village then other villages where it would always be the same they carried their own lives the pressures were enormous in the heat of early afternoon they would remove their helmets and flat jackets walking bear which was dangerous but which helped ease the strain now that that section obviously paints something different than what we experienced because and you can see what he's talking about you know you've got soldiers that don't know what the mission is that don't understand what the strategy is and you know there's all kinds of books about Vietnam and and at the highest you know we talk about sometimes how maybe we didn't do a good job of telling people what the strategy was but at the highest levels in the Vietnam war there's confusion on what the strategy just so there's no way that some frontline grunt understands why he's clearing this village and not that village or why it's that village and not this village they just don't know and I want to make sure that I've thought through all the contenders you know are we ready you know for for these worst case scenarios have we have we planned you know have we rehearsed these things have we tried have we thought what the enemy might do how could they hit us where we had even for senior you know that that burden that you just carried all the time and and for me you know man after after Mark I killed and Ryan got wounded it was just you know four months in our deployment it was just this recognition like man we're that can happen at any time that's it's like this common human emotion that you just make these assumptions and so the only way that units are going to stay focused and not have that happen when they've got good leaders they got a fire team leader in charge of his four guys to step up and make sure that his guys are squirt away and stay in focus they've got to you know they've got a squad leader making sure that his squad is squirt the LPO leading pet officers out there make sure that guys are dialed they're not cutting corners I mean I always saw that with guys you know we've been these type of Overwatch positions you got like some of them had like one stairwell in and out and someone's gonna watch that stairwell someone's got to have a weapon and look down that stairwell for 72 hours but look I think the reality was you were helping reinforce the lesson that you got to have your gear square to away you got to be ready for a contingency like that because that happened all the time to us you know where we like hey this is going to be you know obviously we're in Ramadi and we're like hey this is gonna be a 24 hour operation like no now it's a 48 hour operation now it turns into 72 hour operation we're gonna we're gonna stay here longer than we thought so you got to have you got to be square to be thinking about that and and I know you know we were kind of talking about this a little bit you know when you write a book you're confined in in some way to the structure of the book and to the length of the book and to the balance of the book and so you can't just drill down on some facet that might be it might not be totally pertinent to that particular way that it's laid out but what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to get next time you come on we got to do we got to do our own book we're going to do extreme ownership at least get it through a few chapters because because we we know the authors you know one more thing you know extra mag here extra mag there so you know I've got I've got those extra hand grenades I've got the extra a smoke grenades I've got you know I've got flash bang grenades I've got I've got you know four five extra magazines in addition to like the seven magazines and each of these are 30 round magazines we can you must have a hundred miles you can't at least raise them crazy amount of and then of course I've got my I'm carrying my 40 mic mic that's the that's the thing that fuels people and he just talks about this tiny percentage of men that will overcome that and they'll be brave and to think that we were lucky enough to serve with guys in our task unit and to see the next task unit come in and to see the soldiers and see the marines to overcome that strain on a daily basis that is absolutely one of the most humbling things that I think I will ever experience in my life that's what that's what courage all about you know I think just to to see guys you know that are just in the thick of the fight with bullets missing their heads by inches you know I remember our member on the rooftop of building 99 right on 20th street in the world we were getting hammered I mean enemy rounds coming in by hundreds and hundreds of rounds coming in shattered windows and I remember our EOD bomb disposal technician awesome awesome guys he's he's laying on the rooftop and there's armor piercing rounds coming through the roof punching through concrete wall you know that's just like three inches over his head and he's just laying there and and I remember crawling up there trying to figure out he's there by okay so they'll be one early in the morning so like before the sun comes up and we had to be in place you know you're going you're going in emitator you had to be in the building locked down ready to go because as soon as the call to prayer goes down you know that the city's gonna start awakening you know we're gonna start you know coming out of their houses and cars start n up and people moving around and and the sun's gonna come up you know pretty soon yeah because you would be completely blended by the the fog and nothing where we try to get the high speed once with like the little same thing it's you know talk what's about high tech here's some high tech we got these goggles that had to be miniature fans in them the blow fresh air in there they just suck it all everything sucks nothing works like windshield like personally that's what you need something that was another little TBR team bruiser saying everything sucks nothing works you know because someone is like hey man hey you know this this thing's not working I get everything sucks nothing works deal with it well I think thank God we had actually trained and you know it's been a part of the seal teams it's Vietnam you know going out in the southern California desert and training in you know land warfare you know is that that awesome block where you go out and learn how to patrol which we talked you know you talked a lot about the podcast and started we talked about with that song front and you know where it's man camp out in the southern California desert in this rugged environment with just sharp rocks and but we got to know these areas and you know even though it was a small area you know these tanks might be less than a mile away from you maybe they're even a half a mile down the road you know in that environment if there's if there's you know 35 ID's that could destroy anyone of which could destroy the tank between you and them half a mile away they might as well be a hundred miles away doesn't matter so you know we had to plan for those continues we had to be ready but that it was a strange I certainly remember well and and I remember that conversation as I'm sure you do come back and and recognize them I obviously I woke up and instead of the first thought I had when I woke up of like what's gonna happen today what bad thing can happen today it was like I think the waves look good and I'm going surfing and did go from that thought process from like you said it's the horror of the of the imminent danger because like like you said you can only get lucky so many times and you go out day after day after day and you got watching guys all over my guys all over a body there's no possible way that they can make it through today without taking a casualty and then they and then they make it through that day I got five elements three elements five elements two elements all out on the battlefield the same time there's no way they're gonna make it through today without a casualty they make it through today and guess what you wake up the next day and now you're carrying that day and today so you make it through that day now you're carrying three days and that just built and built and every once in a while obviously we would take a casualty and you know that would be the you give that that morning call the prayer was like we're gonna get some you're gonna get the enemy the enemy in Ramadi for the most part didn't operate at nighttime because we had all the advantages of night vision everything else so they operated during the day so the indicator that the day was starting is the first morning call the prayer and when you hear it you know man that's so crazy how it's like it's like this official beginning of the day you know a call that's like the official commencement of the day in that crazy I guess you think it's crazy and you know speaking of books life I was talking about a little book called extreme ownership what are you hearing from the field on extreme ownership right now the book that we wrote I'm I'm here a lot from the field on extreme ownership I mean what's what's awesome to me about extreme ownership is just continues the resonate with people you know and even you know we're over a year and a half out of publication now and that this thing continues to be in the top 150 or 200 on Amazon and so much of that as a word of mouth driven you know that people are buying that for their team you know and holding well we're waiting a bit we'll did help with that big ad that we put in the New York Times did that help sell it and I say this the heat comes out of the ground so all that sun's been beaten down the ground all day the heat comes out of the ground and then the wind stops and so it's just that is the hottest time it's true here in the southern California desert and it was true when I racked that the hottest few hours was after the sun goes down like the next two to three hours is the worst absolutely brutal on on that that same operation I remember we were we were running on a water because we know we were out we had moved out 300 you know 300 yards or so down the street and set up in that big four story apartment building and we were running on a water so we had to do so I remember we're doing a daytime I was like we got a couple guys we had a stretcher we had a foldable like Israeli stretcher that we we opened up and me and and through other guys are sprinting down the street because we know there's snipers out here you're your sprint hold sprint hold sprint hold and you know a few blocks are going into that and we're kind of moving around the city and the misdirections like man I am smoke I'm having so hard time keep it up and just my hat these these young Marines that are just getting after it carrying heavy heavy equipment and gear and the radio man and the guy carrying his you know his 40 mic mic and there of course they're carrying the two 240 Bravo machine gun which is a belt for machine gun that that was much heavier than what what I you know more at Forty-eight slider machine guns were for our meeting machine guns but these guys were just awesome just awesome trying to you know trying to work with them but you know just seeing the guys guys like Mark Lear I just the most hilarious guy you could imagine just cracking jokes you know and singing the you know the cheeseball 80s tunes you know I am the warrior and and the us laughing about and talking about that stuff and just just that's how they dealt with you know so if you're not doing your job you're gonna get those people get shot in the back and yet if what happens hey we I've been here I've been on the stairwell we look man doesn't we don't this operation doesn't times or we've been in this building multiple times nobody's ever come up to stairs I've been sitting here for hours on in like hasn't happened so people will fall asleep people will stop paying attention and only if you've got good leaders who are gonna go check on that guy and make sure that he recognizes that listen everybody's dependent on you you know not only you're gonna get killed if someone slips up the stairs but the guys people are gonna get shot in the back and yet they were dependent on you to have their back and it requires those good leaders at every level stepping up and going and checking on that guy and if he is tired you can't say what rotating out put somebody else in there but it requires leadership at every level so even with life and death in a line people get complacent and this really goes to what you know you just i got another recent email said it's my favorite shirt to wear because of how it fits and it because it's good you know it's not like a giveaway freesture you get you know when you go to the stocker game and wherever you go you know you know you're cool check them out if you like them support that way get one and represent and psychological warfare and we often patrol across this pipe you know it was the one where you did not have to jump it you got actually just walk across and later actually uh some of the army you guys had burned the grass out there and there were there were IEDs all around we didn't even know we're there when we first patroled in but one guy was with us he slipped off the pipe and fell into the fell into a shit creek which and now you know he's he's got to be in that uniform for the next stuff it's only a 48 hour operation no doubt no shower no shower for good 24 48 hours that's good to have so I think the one thing missing too from you know from uh that we couldn't recreate in that in that mountain area that you were running it was it was so awesome it's awesome to see true persol over the world you know all over the place get after it you know through and loyal listeners jaccopacass and passing it on to others I echo asked me that because we we get a lot of people that on social media they say hey I just enlisted in the army I just listened to Marine Corps I've gone OCS a lot of people you know thanks for you know pushing me that way or whatever and echo says you know bro it's kind of like abuse you know how like you know how like your drink coffee or something like fucking kind of tired i'm going to drink some coffee and when you're not tired you drink it's like whaah I think I think you just came up with a new tag on come to the master it's magical you know come up with a new word I'm going to take some shit for that come to the we're going to call the magical monster maybe we need to cut that maybe cut so what was the reason what was magical about it look for me what was here's here's here's what coming off the stage we were talking about you know what are leaving people the idea of why you know they need to take advantage of every day the gift that's been given to them by those brave warriors that gave their lives so that they have the ability to pursue that you know and so many people that were in the game and had the same goals the same drive exactly and from so many different walks of life you know we had some awesome we had some really high power you know senior executives from from some great companies to you know mid-level managers and front-line leaders that are just aspiring to take on greater ownership entrepreneurs you know the the military law enforcement firefighters paramedics I mean across the space some people that we couldn't even vision or imagine from you know from from volunteer
