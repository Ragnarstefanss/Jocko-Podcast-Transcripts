00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.52
This is Jockel Podcast number 135 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening,

2
00:00:07.52 --> 00:00:21.08
echo. Good evening. Dear Mrs. Speering, there is grief in my heart and in the hearts

3
00:00:21.08 --> 00:00:29.88
of all my comrades for the great sorrow that this war has brought to you and to us.

4
00:00:29.88 --> 00:00:36.16
We all unite to express our heartfelt sympathy and condolence to the mother and family of

5
00:00:36.16 --> 00:00:43.40
one who has fallen in a cause as imperishable as will be the names of those who have fallen

6
00:00:43.40 --> 00:00:46.76
to defend it.

7
00:00:46.76 --> 00:00:54.68
Should there be anything my comrades and I can do to mitigate your grief and to delay your

8
00:00:54.68 --> 00:01:05.44
sorrow. Some little keep sake of Walt as a Marine perhaps, but name it dear Lady and

9
00:01:05.44 --> 00:01:12.80
it shall traverse the ocean to you. Because you do not know me, please do not think

10
00:01:12.80 --> 00:01:22.20
it presumptuous for me to write. You are Walter's mother. I was his inseparable friend

11
00:01:22.20 --> 00:01:30.000
and comrade. That makes us two kindered souls in common grief for our nearest and

12
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:41.84
dearest. Then too, this letter fulfills my duty that I am bound by oath and will to perform.

13
00:01:41.84 --> 00:01:47.20
Many months ago, Walt and I promised each other that should the God of battles called

14
00:01:47.20 --> 00:01:55.04
to one. The other would console the sorrowing mother.

15
00:01:55.04 --> 00:02:04.16
Now Walt has gone west to home and to you forever. But his figure, his voice, his wonderful

16
00:02:04.16 --> 00:02:15.20
personality will always be living truths to me. I myself should the great call come will

17
00:02:15.20 --> 00:02:23.60
go gladly. Confident of a reunion and with faith in the eternal truth of that cause for

18
00:02:23.60 --> 00:02:33.84
which I die. Beneath the green and bellow woods forever connected to the honor of the

19
00:02:33.84 --> 00:02:44.40
Marines lies Walt with his two comrades dead on the field of honor. Above their graves

20
00:02:44.40 --> 00:02:55.20
the stately pines sway in their grandeur and imperishable monument. But greatest of all epitaphs

21
00:02:56.24 --> 00:03:03.36
is that engraved within the hearts of his comrades. A man then whom there was no peer.

22
00:03:03.36 --> 00:03:19.36
In kindness, in understanding, in comradeship, beyond compare. We alone know what could have been

23
00:03:20.80 --> 00:03:29.28
had circumstances so wielded. Whatever befall, whatever sorrow fills us.

24
00:03:29.28 --> 00:03:38.000
One thing I swear to you here, hard by that lonely grave, the very paper that I write upon,

25
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:48.24
taken in a captured German dugout. I swear that Walt is well avenged that he has died not

26
00:03:48.24 --> 00:04:01.92
in vain for his spirit leads us on to ultimate victory. You are proud. I know for you are the mother

27
00:04:01.92 --> 00:04:18.72
of a martyr, a martyr in a holy cause, freedom and liberty. Do you lady, the very thought that

28
00:04:18.72 --> 00:04:31.44
you are in grief, tears my heart, do not sorrow. Death after all is not so terrible and here,

29
00:04:33.60 --> 00:04:46.80
why here, it is glorious, mother. In the name of the 23rd company, in the name of the Marines,

30
00:04:46.80 --> 00:05:02.08
I salute you and all my comrades salute you, devotedly. Sol, seagull.

31
00:05:02.08 --> 00:05:23.76
That was a letter written by Sol Seagull. It was an O333 heavy machine gunner. He was 20 years old.

32
00:05:23.76 --> 00:05:33.76
When he wrote that letter at the grave side of his Marine Corps brother, Walter Spearing was his

33
00:05:33.76 --> 00:05:38.40
name, who was from Philadelphia, who had been amongst the earliest of the Marines to ship over

34
00:05:38.40 --> 00:05:53.44
the war. Who was one of the 1,800 and 11 Americans killed at the Battle of Belowood.

35
00:05:53.44 --> 00:06:18.08
He started a turning hand in theiramente, restart racing, gallons oféŠ€ ranging from unite of

36
00:06:18.08 --> 00:06:30.76
And it's a letter that captures so many different aspects of war and in capturing different

37
00:06:30.76 --> 00:06:37.56
aspects of war it teaches us.

38
00:06:37.56 --> 00:06:43.84
teaches us about leadership it teaches us about human nature teaches us about suffering it

39
00:06:43.84 --> 00:06:54.24
teaches us about death and it teaches us about life.

40
00:06:54.24 --> 00:07:04.20
And tonight back here again to talk to us about all those different subject as a marine

41
00:07:04.20 --> 00:07:09.72
that I was honored to serve with on the battlefield and who I am now honored to work with

42
00:07:09.72 --> 00:07:15.40
once again on a different front.

43
00:07:15.40 --> 00:07:17.88
His name is Dave Burke.

44
00:07:17.88 --> 00:07:21.48
He's been on the podcast before already.

45
00:07:21.48 --> 00:07:26.96
So if you haven't heard that one it was podcast number 69 and you should listen to that

46
00:07:26.96 --> 00:07:33.40
one first to hear about Dave's incredible background as a Marine Corps F-18 fighter pilot

47
00:07:33.40 --> 00:07:41.44
F-16 pilot F-22 pilot F-35 pilot top gun pilot top gun instructor top gun senior instructor

48
00:07:41.44 --> 00:07:49.08
and of course Anglico team leader on the ground with us in the battle of Ramadi.

49
00:07:49.08 --> 00:07:55.96
And if you've listened to podcast 69 then you can hear all about that and tonight

50
00:07:55.96 --> 00:07:59.36
a little deeper on all these different subjects.

51
00:07:59.36 --> 00:08:02.76
Dave thanks for coming back on the show.

52
00:08:02.76 --> 00:08:03.76
Thanks, Chuck.

53
00:08:03.76 --> 00:08:08.16
I'm stuck to be here, man.

54
00:08:08.16 --> 00:08:13.000
You just find these letters like that and it's incredible.

55
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.84
I know I was like, hey, read this and you know your reactions like this is a 20 year old

56
00:08:17.84 --> 00:08:18.84
marine.

57
00:08:18.84 --> 00:08:21.84
Is it a different time?

58
00:08:21.84 --> 00:08:24.12
Is it the language as different back then?

59
00:08:24.12 --> 00:08:31.56
Yeah, and the language is different and if you just hear the words it sounds like a completely

60
00:08:31.56 --> 00:08:36.84
different world and then when you think about what he's saying I know exactly what you

61
00:08:36.84 --> 00:08:42.76
can you can feel what he's feeling and it comes through so so clearly and and I've read

62
00:08:42.76 --> 00:08:43.76
letters like that.

63
00:08:43.76 --> 00:08:45.28
I've heard you read letters like that.

64
00:08:45.28 --> 00:08:50.40
I've seen letters like that and I've written a letter like that.

65
00:08:50.40 --> 00:08:54.52
It didn't sound that eloquent.

66
00:08:54.52 --> 00:08:57.88
But I know that feeling and it's incredible that after all this time how powerful that

67
00:08:57.88 --> 00:09:01.04
comes through man it was that's awesome.

68
00:09:01.04 --> 00:09:08.44
As you and this is another thing that you and I were talking about these lessons that

69
00:09:08.44 --> 00:09:15.96
exists in history, in literature and and it's funny because it's it's things that are

70
00:09:15.96 --> 00:09:19.76
written by privates, it's things that are written by corpus, it's things that are written

71
00:09:19.76 --> 00:09:24.76
by majors and kernels and generals and it's things that are written by emperors and it's

72
00:09:24.76 --> 00:09:30.72
things that are written by conscripts and everything in between.

73
00:09:30.72 --> 00:09:39.52
And every time I every time I even that right there it's like I get another angle to appreciate

74
00:09:39.52 --> 00:09:45.20
and to realize and then you start you start I'll cover Bellowood on this podcast for sure.

75
00:09:45.20 --> 00:09:50.04
But I mean when you read about Bellowood at all it was just savage battle.

76
00:09:50.04 --> 00:09:51.04
Yeah.

77
00:09:51.04 --> 00:09:52.04
Savage battle.

78
00:09:52.04 --> 00:09:58.04
I mean there's one Medal of Honor for a guy that his buddy didn't have his gas mask.

79
00:09:58.04 --> 00:10:02.20
So he took off his own gas mask and gave it to him and then died.

80
00:10:02.20 --> 00:10:09.64
I mean it's it's it's unbelievable and so you were telling me you kind of opened it

81
00:10:09.64 --> 00:10:12.76
back up the history books the war books.

82
00:10:12.76 --> 00:10:13.76
Yeah.

83
00:10:13.76 --> 00:10:19.92
I used to certainly as a kid and early in my career I would read military history all the

84
00:10:19.92 --> 00:10:20.92
time.

85
00:10:20.92 --> 00:10:24.76
I mean some of it was an assignment you know we'd become a lieutenant in the Marine Corps and

86
00:10:24.76 --> 00:10:27.76
there's a kind of a reading list and you want to go through and you do some of it kind

87
00:10:27.76 --> 00:10:31.60
of they call it professional military education PME.

88
00:10:31.60 --> 00:10:34.76
But I used to be really interested in it and I just kind of do it on my own a lot of it was

89
00:10:34.76 --> 00:10:40.04
aviation centric but I got away from it and for the latter half of my career I didn't do

90
00:10:40.04 --> 00:10:41.88
military history at all.

91
00:10:41.88 --> 00:10:48.20
It wasn't it just wasn't something that really captivated me and in the last year

92
00:10:48.20 --> 00:10:54.88
and a half or so partially and now not partially mostly because of this podcast.

93
00:10:54.88 --> 00:10:59.16
I've actually gone back and read red some of the books and and you and I've talked about

94
00:10:59.16 --> 00:11:05.56
a lot of different ones with the old breed Eugene sledge.

95
00:11:05.56 --> 00:11:09.84
So that was a book I read a long time ago and it was it was incredible book very powerful

96
00:11:09.84 --> 00:11:19.28
but I went back and read that book a little while back and I had stopped thinking and

97
00:11:19.28 --> 00:11:22.64
paying attention to the meanings.

98
00:11:22.64 --> 00:11:26.32
I was I was I was always paying attention to the chronology in the past okay this happened

99
00:11:26.32 --> 00:11:29.84
here this is the lesson learned and this is the movement and it was all kind of very

100
00:11:29.84 --> 00:11:37.88
sanitary and I lost what meant to hear their stories and I used to read them and I think

101
00:11:37.88 --> 00:11:43.40
I just try to pay attention to what happened and not really learn as much from him or

102
00:11:43.40 --> 00:11:49.72
from them and and I've read more in the last year than I had in honestly jocquipy the

103
00:11:49.72 --> 00:11:50.96
previous five.

104
00:11:50.96 --> 00:11:56.72
It's not more and I'm reading all the time and I'm and once you start sort of digging

105
00:11:56.72 --> 00:12:02.48
into that world there's there's more books than I could ever read in my entire life

106
00:12:02.48 --> 00:12:11.48
there everywhere and it has renewed the way I how much I read but it's also changed

107
00:12:11.48 --> 00:12:16.72
the way I read and it's been a really good experience for me I've learned a lot in the

108
00:12:16.72 --> 00:12:17.96
last year.

109
00:12:17.96 --> 00:12:22.12
And this is another thing I talked to you about as we were we were talking about the subject

110
00:12:22.12 --> 00:12:29.52
the other day and I brought up this quote from Lusosia and and the quote is if you know

111
00:12:29.52 --> 00:12:37.60
the way broadly you will see it and everything and to me that is what makes that is what

112
00:12:37.60 --> 00:12:46.48
has I guess recalibrated reading for me is that when you start seeing all these connections

113
00:12:46.48 --> 00:12:52.44
and everything and and part of it quite frankly comes from the fact that I wrote a book

114
00:12:52.44 --> 00:12:58.20
that is about this subject and once you go that deep in it it's like okay now I start

115
00:12:58.20 --> 00:13:04.48
seeing it everywhere and I mean even kind of all started it definitely all started with

116
00:13:04.48 --> 00:13:10.72
about face for me with about face for me when I was in Iraq and I knew I knew about

117
00:13:10.72 --> 00:13:14.36
face was a great book and this is this is on my second but on my first appointment my

118
00:13:14.36 --> 00:13:19.08
book was with the old breed as a matter of fact that was my book and I thought okay

119
00:13:19.08 --> 00:13:25.44
but it was so disconnected it was such a stretch I mean my first appointment to Iraq was

120
00:13:25.44 --> 00:13:32.96
absolutely absolutely nothing like with the old breed other the fact that we were American

121
00:13:32.96 --> 00:13:40.08
like the similarities ended there right it was nothing like with the old breed nothing you

122
00:13:40.08 --> 00:13:43.96
know other than in my mind okay well these were horrible things that are happening you

123
00:13:43.96 --> 00:13:47.68
just it was really hard to make that connection I'll tell you what though our deployment

124
00:13:47.68 --> 00:13:55.24
to a body the similarities between Romadi and and about face were incredible not just you

125
00:13:55.24 --> 00:14:00.16
know one of the things that hit me right out of the gate is when hack worth gets to

126
00:14:00.16 --> 00:14:04.52
Vietnam and those guys are getting killed and they're getting killed by sniper fire

127
00:14:04.52 --> 00:14:10.28
indirect fire and booby traps which we now call IDs for whatever reason and that one

128
00:14:10.28 --> 00:14:14.84
section of the book where they've taken hundreds like a hundred something casualties and

129
00:14:14.84 --> 00:14:21.32
they've and they've they've contacted the enemy zero times enemy it's an enemy killed zero

130
00:14:21.32 --> 00:14:27.24
and I'm thinking myself this is a nightmare this is a nightmare and that nightmare it

131
00:14:27.24 --> 00:14:34.56
shows itself over and over and over again and what's so hard is an I'll tell you where

132
00:14:34.56 --> 00:14:41.36
hit me again it hit me again on on Lewis polar when Lewis polar is rotating between

133
00:14:41.36 --> 00:14:47.92
the three different sections in one of them was called Riviera and he's saying every

134
00:14:47.92 --> 00:14:53.76
time they go into Riviera they take wounded or they take killed and on top of that they

135
00:14:53.76 --> 00:15:01.36
don't ever see the enemy and I'm thinking myself it's maddening right it's maddening

136
00:15:01.36 --> 00:15:07.68
when you look back and your detached which where detached now and I don't know if cultures different

137
00:15:07.68 --> 00:15:14.48
I don't know if our cultures different I don't know if we value human life more I don't know that

138
00:15:15.76 --> 00:15:22.08
but when you read it it's maddening to think about that and you could see that like hack worth

139
00:15:22.08 --> 00:15:29.92
he didn't like that he didn't like that at all and that was all that was I think maybe it was you

140
00:15:29.92 --> 00:15:36.72
that told me when I had Jim Mucchiamon and or a couple people told me they were like you sounded

141
00:15:36.72 --> 00:15:44.96
giddy yeah and I said well yes I was giddy and and here I was but it was very interesting to

142
00:15:44.96 --> 00:15:52.000
go and talk to Mucchiama because what was interesting to me is you there's the there's the

143
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.84
public persona of some guy that was in the military right there's the public persona of some

144
00:15:55.84 --> 00:16:01.28
guy that was in the military myself included you all of us there's that public persona of oh this is

145
00:16:01.28 --> 00:16:05.52
what this guy's perceived as but then there's like okay what about all the people that served

146
00:16:05.52 --> 00:16:12.40
with that person what do they really think yeah and what was hack worth really like and so going

147
00:16:12.40 --> 00:16:21.44
to meet Mucch I was very curious now I had read an interview with him where I knew that he had these

148
00:16:21.44 --> 00:16:25.84
very he held him in the highest as yeah that he was a little bit didn't come as a surprise to me

149
00:16:26.48 --> 00:16:35.60
but still it was it was incredible that the perception that I had of hack worth was accurate it was

150
00:16:35.60 --> 00:16:42.24
accurate and when you when you heard Mucch talk about it when he said we called the Mr infantry yes

151
00:16:42.80 --> 00:16:51.12
I I I was just thinking to myself is there anything cooler in the world than to be known

152
00:16:51.12 --> 00:16:58.48
throughout the army has Mr infantry yeah you said something that that jumped out of me a little bit

153
00:16:58.48 --> 00:17:03.92
you were you were just talking about you know is is is culture different it is something different

154
00:17:05.52 --> 00:17:10.08
so let me just say this a little bit because you know I've even thought a little bit about why do I

155
00:17:10.08 --> 00:17:15.44
see things differently than I used to what why have I evolved in a certain way so did I spent 23 years

156
00:17:15.44 --> 00:17:20.88
in the Marine Corps 23 years as a US Marine and a whole bunch of years just wanting to be a Marine

157
00:17:22.64 --> 00:17:29.44
I was in Ramadi for seven months so if you just kind of do the math it's just not a lot of time

158
00:17:31.44 --> 00:17:38.88
everything I think about every leadership lesson every when I hear you talk about a book when I read a

159
00:17:38.88 --> 00:17:44.32
book when I think all of those things the frame of reference I have the thing I think about is those seven

160
00:17:44.32 --> 00:17:53.52
months and had I not had those seven months of and look Ramadi obviously was it was a maddening place it was

161
00:17:53.52 --> 00:18:00.48
crazy but if I didn't have that I don't think I would be able to appreciate or understand and without

162
00:18:00.48 --> 00:18:06.72
that frame of reference without that understanding of some connection to that it actually makes it

163
00:18:06.72 --> 00:18:09.60
difficult and I would have never guessed it if I would have tell you hey I'm going to look back

164
00:18:09.60 --> 00:18:13.92
on my 23 year career and all those things I heard you listen to my bio it's always strange here someone read it out

165
00:18:15.92 --> 00:18:22.24
the the the the the the most powerful thing in that was seven months in Ramadi that's a thing

166
00:18:22.24 --> 00:18:30.24
that outshines all of it because of what you just described because of that feeling and I don't know if it's

167
00:18:30.24 --> 00:18:35.12
that that that culture is different or societies if we have different values or we value human

168
00:18:35.12 --> 00:18:42.24
like differently but without the frame of reference it can be hard to capture but if you start to think of it

169
00:18:42.24 --> 00:18:47.60
in in a different way and that's sort of what that that quote means and I know this is kind of a deep thought but

170
00:18:49.04 --> 00:18:54.32
that's you see things differently and you think about things and you start to see things you didn't

171
00:18:54.32 --> 00:18:58.56
even know where they're before and that's why when I went back and read look I've read a book and I

172
00:18:58.56 --> 00:19:05.52
read the exact same book again and to see and hear and understand things differently the

173
00:19:05.52 --> 00:19:09.92
segment of book that was and for me for me it was with the old be that was the book that sort of

174
00:19:09.92 --> 00:19:14.80
hit me square I got to go to Okinawa I got to walk that ground that and to go back and reread that book

175
00:19:14.80 --> 00:19:20.80
recently and have it seem so different that has really stuck with me and and that was sort of the

176
00:19:20.80 --> 00:19:25.76
reason why I got back into reading some of them the same books and some are different but there

177
00:19:25.76 --> 00:19:30.40
is something about that perspective that changes you and I would have never guessed that throughout my

178
00:19:30.40 --> 00:19:37.52
career I was want to be a pilot it's literally wanted to do that I would sort of define my experience

179
00:19:37.52 --> 00:19:42.000
based on those seven months and how that influence everything that I see now and the weird thing is

180
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:52.000
about Ramadi is when you compare Ramadi to Pelu you compare Ramadi to Okinawa you compare Ramadi to

181
00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:00.08
Normandy you compare Ramadi to you compare Ramadi to those places and our experience was just

182
00:20:01.04 --> 00:20:08.08
it just pales it just absolutely pales yeah you and I have talked about this a lot you actually sent

183
00:20:08.08 --> 00:20:11.84
me I think you sent me a text or an email a couple weeks ago you're like hey do me a favor

184
00:20:12.48 --> 00:20:18.40
just verify I got this right I wanted this make sure I got your combat experience in your first

185
00:20:18.40 --> 00:20:25.28
deployment correct and it was that I I was in combat and I rack and I was thinking yeah yeah

186
00:20:25.28 --> 00:20:32.64
you got it all right I dropped a bomb that was my that was a legitimate combat experience before

187
00:20:32.64 --> 00:20:38.40
that's pre 911 yeah pre 911 you were one of the few guys with combat yeah that's meant you

188
00:20:38.40 --> 00:20:44.88
had dropped a bomb a bomb singular and I and the thought wasn't just how ridiculous that sounds but

189
00:20:44.88 --> 00:20:50.80
I thought I don't ever want Charlie Plummer Bill reader to hear me say that yeah I don't want them

190
00:20:50.80 --> 00:20:57.28
to have is almost embarrassed and and even like you said Ramadi which for me which was sort of like

191
00:20:57.28 --> 00:21:01.28
the world series and the Super Bowl combined into one like the most powerful thing and

192
00:21:02.32 --> 00:21:06.56
with the old breed since we've been talking about that you talk about the battle of Okinawa

193
00:21:06.56 --> 00:21:15.44
and what they endured I mean it is so humbling and and almost honestly man doubt-riding a

194
00:21:15.44 --> 00:21:22.16
little embarrassing to try to share the same experience we saw that with Tom Five and I remember

195
00:21:22.16 --> 00:21:26.24
Tom Five was on the podcast and he was so grateful for he was thanking me for what we had done

196
00:21:26.24 --> 00:21:32.32
and what we accomplished and I'm thinking this is a man that has a purple heart from World War II

197
00:21:32.32 --> 00:21:41.20
Korea and Vietnam and he's thanking me for what I did and you know that's that's a frame of

198
00:21:41.20 --> 00:21:45.44
reference that I think is important and something the podcast does is so extremely well as it

199
00:21:45.44 --> 00:21:49.60
gives those guys a chance to share that story that that otherwise they wouldn't get a chance to

200
00:21:50.40 --> 00:21:58.24
is there a way to get I'm trying to figure out what I was missing right I was trying to

201
00:21:58.24 --> 00:22:05.68
figure out what how can you get somebody that's a 18-year-old corporal to read a book with the

202
00:22:05.68 --> 00:22:12.000
perspective that with the right perspective is that possible? In 18-year-old they burq it wasn't

203
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:23.60
possible I can tell you that for sure it wasn't and I don't know if that's a case but I do know that

204
00:22:23.60 --> 00:22:32.88
if you get an 18-year-old day burq to start to read and start to think about it that actually

205
00:22:32.88 --> 00:22:39.68
builds over time and that creates some sort of foundation that I think with time and perspective

206
00:22:39.68 --> 00:22:45.04
you can actually reach those it reads that but there's no way at that age no matter what you said

207
00:22:45.04 --> 00:22:50.16
no matter how articulate you were no matter how powerful the story was I don't think you're reaching

208
00:22:50.16 --> 00:22:57.52
me and I don't mean that to be discouraging but I think that's that's a hard lesson I think you know

209
00:22:57.52 --> 00:23:03.52
for certainly what I was going through at that time in my life. It's just not gonna happen.

210
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.48
It's gonna yeah it's one's two because what you're focused on when you're 18 and you read with the

211
00:23:10.48 --> 00:23:18.32
old breed you're like like I remember my earliest memories of with the old breed are these guys

212
00:23:18.32 --> 00:23:25.52
were ripping people's gold tea out with pliers you're thinking whoa that's crazy like that's the big

213
00:23:25.52 --> 00:23:29.84
that's that's probably the big takeaway for my first read when I was whatever years old

214
00:23:29.84 --> 00:23:38.16
yep of with the old breed it's you you you see it for the things that seem not real and you're like man

215
00:23:38.16 --> 00:23:44.48
that is incredible and that is awesome and I also think that goes so you talk about love that

216
00:23:44.48 --> 00:23:50.48
that sort of that feeling of invincibility too when you're young and that like immune to not just

217
00:23:50.48 --> 00:23:55.28
the physical risks not just the potential of getting hurt or getting injured or getting shot or

218
00:23:55.28 --> 00:24:00.16
some of those worst things but the mental and emotional risks that go along with experiencing that

219
00:24:01.36 --> 00:24:08.56
that's a really hard lesson now the other side of that is you know when I deployed to Rammadi

220
00:24:08.56 --> 00:24:17.36
almost everybody on my team was a first deployment brand new young US Marine you met Marcus

221
00:24:17.36 --> 00:24:25.76
Perez he came to the the muster you know he was a young kid and you walk in there sort of with this

222
00:24:26.96 --> 00:24:34.24
kind of this bullet proof approach and it's not how it is when you leave it's not the same

223
00:24:34.24 --> 00:24:42.08
and and and in some ways like you said the scale is is different than a benapelilu or a guanoil or any

224
00:24:42.08 --> 00:24:48.32
of those things you know that that we just talked about but when it's happening to you it's it could

225
00:24:48.32 --> 00:24:53.68
be a single round a single mortar a single shot a single wound if it's happening to you it sort of

226
00:24:53.68 --> 00:24:58.64
feels like the it's happening to the whole world it's really impactful and that's probably why

227
00:24:58.64 --> 00:25:04.40
if I look back in my career the thing that's the most powerful experience that I had that sort of

228
00:25:04.40 --> 00:25:09.28
outshines everything by so much is is that time in Rammadi because I was exposed to things

229
00:25:09.84 --> 00:25:14.56
that I never saw as a pilot and never would have seen had I not been on that deployment

230
00:25:15.28 --> 00:25:21.36
you know what I was thinking so one of the things I remember probably I don't know if it was 10 or 15

231
00:25:21.36 --> 00:25:30.56
podcasts deep into into this podcast I remember saying during one of the podcasts and I've said

232
00:25:30.56 --> 00:25:37.44
it a few times along the way I remember saying that these people that I'm talking about in these books

233
00:25:37.44 --> 00:25:44.16
they're not characters yeah these are people and I think at some point for me that transition in my

234
00:25:44.16 --> 00:25:52.40
brain happened where I was saying to myself these are these are people and I think I got a little bit

235
00:25:52.40 --> 00:25:59.60
of it in my platoon commander tour because you know there was hey it was it was a good solid deployment

236
00:25:59.60 --> 00:26:04.24
was there a risk sure there was risky wasn't super high risk I had had a great crew of guys but

237
00:26:04.24 --> 00:26:08.64
you know there was there was stress and there was personalities and you start to see that when you

238
00:26:08.64 --> 00:26:13.84
read about a guy and you think I kind of know that guy just I just know him a little bit I just

239
00:26:13.84 --> 00:26:19.20
know him a little bit and and you start to realize that those people in these books they're real people

240
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:28.72
and I think that for me was a huge leap between connecting me to the text that I was reading

241
00:26:28.72 --> 00:26:38.08
and I'll tell you another thing and straight up voice when I started thinking about reading these

242
00:26:38.08 --> 00:26:42.40
things when I started reading these aloud when I started reading them and hearing them in my own

243
00:26:42.40 --> 00:26:48.72
headset like on the podcast that was an impact and now it's happened it happened with Bill

244
00:26:48.72 --> 00:26:52.80
Reader happened with Joe de Medic at happen when these guys come on here and they hear me read what they

245
00:26:52.80 --> 00:27:00.24
wrote and it hits them and so that's another part of it too there is an element when you read that's missing

246
00:27:00.88 --> 00:27:07.92
there's an element of voice that is just more powerful it's just more powerful and I remember when I

247
00:27:07.92 --> 00:27:14.48
read the forgotten highlander when I read that book I read it on the plane coming back calling a guy

248
00:27:14.48 --> 00:27:20.56
over in Scotland a buddy of mine who I done some work with he gave me this book and he I was on podcast

249
00:27:20.56 --> 00:27:24.88
11 and he was hey you got to check on this book I won't try to do it Scottish accent plus he's a

250
00:27:24.88 --> 00:27:29.76
mumbler he's like he's gonna check up this book mate and so he gives me this book and I'm sort of thinking oh

251
00:27:29.76 --> 00:27:36.32
okay you know I just I wasn't sure but I had made enough of a enough of a leap in my brain

252
00:27:36.32 --> 00:27:43.04
that when I started reading that book I said to myself wow this is gonna be this is gonna be a

253
00:27:43.04 --> 00:27:48.000
really powerful podcast so I read the book so then when we come this is podcast number 12

254
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.16
when we came when I came into record it I thought yeah this is gonna be really heavy but when I read it

255
00:27:54.16 --> 00:28:00.000
it was like I was getting hit in the head with with a sledg hammer and that's the first podcast that

256
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:06.80
when I got to the end of the book I actually didn't know what to say because what do you say what do you

257
00:28:06.80 --> 00:28:13.84
say about a guy that what do you say about a guy that that that put maggots on his flesh to eat

258
00:28:13.84 --> 00:28:20.96
away the dead flesh what what do you say about that and so that's the first podcast where I said

259
00:28:21.60 --> 00:28:27.52
when I got done with it the next time I did a podcast that was heavy like that I knew that I had to

260
00:28:27.52 --> 00:28:34.72
get myself somewhere to go I had to give myself some thought about how am I gonna make this

261
00:28:35.84 --> 00:28:41.60
how does this become something I like I don't get out of this whole because that's what that's what

262
00:28:41.60 --> 00:28:47.84
you're doing and so there's a level of that as well when you hear like when you hear a hardcore

263
00:28:47.84 --> 00:28:53.04
history podcast you get a great storytelling but he's reading quotes from people but it's so much

264
00:28:53.04 --> 00:28:58.40
more powerful when you hear it audibly and we you know people say I'm about extreme ownership too

265
00:28:58.40 --> 00:29:02.32
people say oh yeah I love that book and this and we'll say you gotta get the audio book

266
00:29:02.32 --> 00:29:07.28
because it's life and I reading it and you can hear I mean how much is communicated in the tone of

267
00:29:07.28 --> 00:29:15.36
voice there's a lot when you said earlier about the the audible piece of that

268
00:29:17.28 --> 00:29:22.000
when you finish my first podcast so when I was on uh this is we were talking about this almost a year and

269
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.04
half ago now you know April I think of last year I guess you finished with a letter that cat

270
00:29:29.92 --> 00:29:34.72
wrote to Chris now I didn't know we hadn't discussed that and I didn't know how it was going to

271
00:29:34.72 --> 00:29:39.20
finish and you know we spent all that time you know talking about me and my experiences things like that

272
00:29:39.84 --> 00:29:44.80
I knew that letter very well I have a copy of that letter and I've read that letter several times

273
00:29:45.84 --> 00:29:51.20
I had never read that letter out loud to myself I never read it but it's I've shared it you know

274
00:29:51.20 --> 00:29:57.92
with Whitney and and I've shared that letter hearing you say a letter that I knew

275
00:29:59.28 --> 00:30:05.28
almost line by line I know that letter really well made that letter like I had never heard it before

276
00:30:05.28 --> 00:30:09.92
and I remember it look it's hard to hear because I it's Chris and it's hard for me because that's

277
00:30:09.92 --> 00:30:15.36
a really impactful thing very emotional thing and that is a that's a crush of for me man I know

278
00:30:15.36 --> 00:30:23.76
you understand that but I had never heard it out loud and in there's a book I'm reading now that

279
00:30:23.76 --> 00:30:28.88
I have read the preface of the book which is only about three pages kind of to explain I've read it

280
00:30:28.88 --> 00:30:38.96
out loud to myself like five times and it's it's something that I overlooked the impact of hearing it

281
00:30:38.96 --> 00:30:42.08
as opposed to reading and I read the book is really cool book I think a sentient page this book's

282
00:30:42.08 --> 00:30:47.12
awesome you should check it out I read the the preface out loud to myself and having had read it three

283
00:30:47.12 --> 00:30:51.92
four times I'm just hearing it it was like reading it for the first time the the voice that you give that

284
00:30:51.92 --> 00:30:59.20
makes it makes the words become real like a like that person wrote the book is saying out loud

285
00:30:59.20 --> 00:31:07.52
and that difference there it's not subtle it's huge it's a huge huge thing that that is one of the

286
00:31:07.52 --> 00:31:11.28
great things about when people do it when they do it on podcasts and you're putting somebody else's

287
00:31:11.28 --> 00:31:16.40
voice in action most of the time reading books by people that are long gone and you're telling

288
00:31:16.40 --> 00:31:21.20
stories that nobody would ever hear and even if you read them it misses something and I think

289
00:31:21.20 --> 00:31:26.24
the power that is huge and it brought me right back to our last podcast which was you sitting right where

290
00:31:26.24 --> 00:31:33.28
you are reading cats letter to Chris and as it like I said like I had never heard it before it was

291
00:31:33.28 --> 00:31:47.44
it's a totally different level you know what podcasts was another podcast that sort of it got me

292
00:31:48.48 --> 00:31:58.32
was one soldier's war by arcadey and that part in the end of that podcast where

293
00:31:58.32 --> 00:32:08.40
it's again that was podcast number 18 and he's he's he's quoting these wounded soldiers that

294
00:32:08.40 --> 00:32:15.04
were sitting begging for money basically and he's talking about how this guy is saying

295
00:32:15.84 --> 00:32:20.72
if I would kill all these he's talking about this this soldier's talking about everyone on the

296
00:32:20.72 --> 00:32:26.48
streets in Moscow he says I would kill everyone of these people to bring back my brothers you're

297
00:32:26.48 --> 00:32:32.88
reading this going good God that is a powerful powerful book did you see him in the news recently

298
00:32:32.88 --> 00:32:39.28
no he faked his own death oh yeah absolutely yes all these people we talked about he did

299
00:32:39.28 --> 00:32:45.20
hit me up on social media and I was all been what a tragedy and yeah I was totally bummed out

300
00:32:45.20 --> 00:32:51.20
and then sure enough he had faked his own death he had even fooled his wife he didn't tell his wife

301
00:32:51.20 --> 00:32:57.28
that's that takes a lot of courage he's a courageous guy already but yeah to fake your death and

302
00:32:57.28 --> 00:33:02.64
not give your wife a heads up about it that's that's hardcore that's that's problematic yeah

303
00:33:03.52 --> 00:33:08.64
and and that that feeling to it's one thing to sort of have that feeling but to be willing to

304
00:33:08.64 --> 00:33:16.32
express that feeling that I would do that to all of these people that is that's a that's saying a

305
00:33:16.32 --> 00:33:21.44
lot man I mean that is deep to I mean I've had some pretty hardcore thoughts certainly in my

306
00:33:21.44 --> 00:33:28.64
time like I'm like I sure that one but to put it out there you know I mean that's that gets to the

307
00:33:28.64 --> 00:33:35.04
core of of just how how much people feel from those experiences how powerful those feelings are

308
00:33:35.04 --> 00:33:40.80
and those guys had had no mercy those those Russians soldiers they had no mercy it was that

309
00:33:40.80 --> 00:33:46.32
that part of what he's talking about the sergeants beat the corp rules the captains beat the sergeants

310
00:33:46.32 --> 00:33:52.32
the majors beat the captains yeah it's just a nightmare yeah it's just a complete nightmare it

311
00:33:52.32 --> 00:33:57.12
makes you wonder how any of that is is makes any of it remotely functional like how does that

312
00:33:57.12 --> 00:34:03.60
system function at all under that setting under that environment how could anybody at the bottom of that

313
00:34:04.56 --> 00:34:10.32
hierarchy be willing to go do any of the things they went and did you know you're talking about you

314
00:34:10.32 --> 00:34:17.60
know this thing from from Bella wood they're they literally know most of you're gonna die we're

315
00:34:17.60 --> 00:34:21.60
gonna charge across open fields and a machine guns we use that example at echelon front is something

316
00:34:21.60 --> 00:34:28.80
that you would never do and that's what they were doing I mean border line just human waves

317
00:34:28.80 --> 00:34:35.04
if we do it enough we're gonna get 50 75 yards of terrain out of it we're gonna move the line

318
00:34:35.04 --> 00:34:41.44
400 yards and we're gonna send wave after wave after wave and guys are left right like this is

319
00:34:41.44 --> 00:34:49.12
burnt border line at death sentence what what people are capable of doing and under those

320
00:34:49.12 --> 00:34:58.16
environments is unreal sometimes world war one it just is just you know it's you know what's funny

321
00:34:58.16 --> 00:35:03.44
is I say that about everyone every war so the world we're like unbelievable and then you you

322
00:35:03.44 --> 00:35:10.64
talked about Napoleon who like nothing like that and then I read the book on the coldest war

323
00:35:10.64 --> 00:35:16.96
or colder than hell do they're like nothing like that like there is there is something that has

324
00:35:16.96 --> 00:35:21.84
happened and every one of the stories you've talked about or I think how is that possible and they

325
00:35:21.84 --> 00:35:26.80
all have their own unique thing about them that just seems unreal I'm I'm gonna throw in an

326
00:35:26.80 --> 00:35:35.44
orange vest and mark my position in 30 below so you can see me so you know where I am

327
00:35:35.84 --> 00:35:40.88
because I'm the leader because I'm the leader and you get lead yeah yeah

328
00:35:41.68 --> 00:35:50.48
unreal that being said world war one no I don't I don't know that that I don't know that

329
00:35:50.48 --> 00:35:59.60
that is out there the the complete lack of control that you had as a individual soldier yeah as a not

330
00:36:00.24 --> 00:36:07.44
even as a upleton commander as a company commander you had no control of your fate it that's that's

331
00:36:07.44 --> 00:36:12.24
where that's what scares me so much about world war one it wasn't like hey jockel here's here's

332
00:36:12.24 --> 00:36:17.04
the situation here's what we're trying to accomplish why don't you go figure out the best way to do it

333
00:36:17.04 --> 00:36:21.28
and I go okay you know what cool I can do this we can we can come up with cool tactics we can make

334
00:36:21.28 --> 00:36:31.28
some stuff happen it was hey tomorrow morning at 0600 14000 of us are gonna go at 0600

335
00:36:31.68 --> 00:36:37.36
and then guess what's gonna happen at 06 15 another 14000 yeah and guess what's gonna happen at 06 30

336
00:36:37.36 --> 00:36:43.12
another 14000 and guess what of vast majority they were gonna be wounded or killed and that's that

337
00:36:43.12 --> 00:36:52.000
so that that to me and and I'll tell you what they call that the war to end all wars I think

338
00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:03.36
if there would have been internet yeah photographers Instagram Twitter YouTube that might have been

339
00:37:03.36 --> 00:37:10.48
the last war right that might have been the last war if you were it's not that if you saw that

340
00:37:10.48 --> 00:37:15.20
as a leader because I'm just I'm what when I think about I think about like you're a general

341
00:37:15.92 --> 00:37:21.68
and you're in charge and you organize this big operation and then you you give the execute order

342
00:37:22.24 --> 00:37:32.40
and then 22000 men are killed in the first 24 hours who does that yeah who does that now

343
00:37:33.84 --> 00:37:38.48
and this is this is a dichotomy because are there situations where people have done

344
00:37:38.48 --> 00:37:42.88
operations and are there situations that war that it's like hey guess what we are going to do

345
00:37:42.88 --> 00:37:47.12
this mission and we don't have a real good chance to come and back and that's the way it is

346
00:37:47.12 --> 00:37:54.48
and it's a strategic piece of the mission and does that happen could that happen absolutely

347
00:37:54.48 --> 00:37:58.56
and do people in the military sign-up for that what I sign up for that if that was what was required

348
00:37:58.56 --> 00:38:03.84
well yeah that's what we signed up for but it has a leader like that to be sitting there looking at

349
00:38:03.84 --> 00:38:13.52
25000 men and you gained you know 75 yards of mud and and you know what you go okay that was bad

350
00:38:13.52 --> 00:38:17.68
we're not going to do that again no no you know what you say you know what we'll do it harder

351
00:38:17.68 --> 00:38:26.08
right we'll do it harder which is which is what makes me it makes that war to me just absolutely

352
00:38:26.08 --> 00:38:34.08
sickening and yeah it's sickening it is it absolutely is and the calculus that goes into that

353
00:38:34.08 --> 00:38:39.76
is something that is completely disconnected from the value of human life completely disconnected

354
00:38:39.76 --> 00:38:48.64
of what that impact is and then you you read this letter and that's 14000 moms

355
00:38:48.64 --> 00:38:58.48
on that one way that one time that's 14000 of these letters and the disconnect of human life

356
00:38:59.92 --> 00:39:03.12
yeah it's it's actually hard kind of hard to fathom you talked about you know

357
00:39:03.68 --> 00:39:09.44
yeah the high risk operation you know we're going to go into the worst possible

358
00:39:09.44 --> 00:39:14.88
situation because yeah and you know what we all kind of secretly would say hey if that I'm

359
00:39:14.88 --> 00:39:20.80
the volunteer for that you know the high risk but as as that's just how we do operations all the time

360
00:39:20.80 --> 00:39:27.92
that's just what we do yeah now that's that's that's actually a nightmare yeah

361
00:39:31.20 --> 00:39:38.56
in the other thing with World War one right like World War two you're looking at

362
00:39:38.56 --> 00:39:44.08
Nazis and you're looking at the Imperial Academy ceremony and you're thinking

363
00:39:44.08 --> 00:39:51.84
we've got real bad guys here we got legit bad guys that's that's a factor too right

364
00:39:53.04 --> 00:39:58.40
Germany World War one it's like yeah we wanted a little extra land who's that land for

365
00:39:58.40 --> 00:40:02.64
you know what I talk about with you know we wouldn't we would work with companies and I say

366
00:40:03.84 --> 00:40:08.56
so okay CEO says you know my frontline troops aren't doing what they're supposed to do

367
00:40:08.56 --> 00:40:14.80
and it's affecting our bottom line and you know I say oh we we got to explain to them why it's

368
00:40:14.80 --> 00:40:20.64
important right and so then CEO goes down and says hey you guys need to do a better job on the

369
00:40:20.64 --> 00:40:25.20
frontline so that the company can be more profitable and the frontline people are like we don't care

370
00:40:25.20 --> 00:40:32.000
yeah more powerful that doesn't matter to me yeah I'm making 17 bucks an hour and I got a wife

371
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.44
and I got a kid and I got a basketball game tonight and we got a mortgage and I got a house payment

372
00:40:35.44 --> 00:40:40.32
the company being profitable makes no difference to me whatsoever yeah so imagine now you're

373
00:40:40.32 --> 00:40:48.88
a world war one and you're gonna get an extra 14 miles of land that's the goal to get 14 miles

374
00:40:48.88 --> 00:40:59.52
of land in some country and and it's not for you it's for like the government yeah it's absolutely

375
00:40:59.52 --> 00:41:04.96
it's a trotius yeah and and when you're sending US Marines across the Atlantic Ocean

376
00:41:05.92 --> 00:41:12.72
to get engaged in that war like to keep Germany from encroaching a little bit too far west

377
00:41:13.60 --> 00:41:20.32
you know yeah yeah yeah yeah the the why doesn't you know that doesn't that doesn't resonate

378
00:41:20.32 --> 00:41:23.92
have I have I ever talked about I do I don't know if I've talked about I have I ever talked

379
00:41:23.92 --> 00:41:29.84
about the white flowers thing they didn't in Britain the white flower so if you were like a

380
00:41:29.84 --> 00:41:36.64
able bodied young man if you were a military age male yeah and and you weren't wearing a uniform

381
00:41:36.64 --> 00:41:43.20
and you weren't like fighting women would come up and give you a white flower it was the mark of shame

382
00:41:43.20 --> 00:41:50.48
and the government started that campaign yeah the government started that campaign of hey

383
00:41:50.48 --> 00:41:55.60
you see you see someone that's not uniform military age male able bodied fighting man

384
00:41:56.16 --> 00:42:02.64
you go up and give them a white flower he's a coward I'm I'm prepping a book right now for the

385
00:42:02.64 --> 00:42:11.28
bodcast and actually a couple books but it's a nightmare because what they're doing is they're

386
00:42:11.28 --> 00:42:21.20
executing British soldiers that have that that dessert or runaway or have shell shock yeah they're

387
00:42:21.20 --> 00:42:26.64
just dysfunctional they they can't do it anymore and it's it's awful some of the stories these

388
00:42:26.64 --> 00:42:33.44
guys are soldiers that have been on the line for a year and they break they break which everyone

389
00:42:35.20 --> 00:42:39.04
Dick Winner's talks about people break brave the braveest guys yeah they might break

390
00:42:39.04 --> 00:42:43.04
and you gotta get them all off the line hack worth same thing you got brave guys sometimes

391
00:42:43.04 --> 00:42:48.08
got to get them off the line old war one we got a British soldier he's been fighting for a year

392
00:42:48.08 --> 00:42:53.60
in the trenches he's been getting mortored he's been getting bombed he says I can't do this anymore

393
00:42:53.60 --> 00:43:00.08
okay we're gonna shoot you a dawn and they did it yeah that's another thing it's completely insane

394
00:43:00.08 --> 00:43:04.88
yeah we use the analogy a lot we talk about this in our front and like hey it your folks when

395
00:43:04.88 --> 00:43:07.92
you're pushing your folks too hard it's like it's like driving a car in the red you

396
00:43:07.92 --> 00:43:11.92
you're running this car in the red you're running hard and if you keep them in the red too long

397
00:43:12.56 --> 00:43:16.96
that car is gonna break and then just gonna break now you can you can push to the red a little bit

398
00:43:16.96 --> 00:43:20.32
you can kind of throttle up it and and do that and then you gotta bring it back and that's sort of

399
00:43:20.32 --> 00:43:23.92
one of the leaders job is sort of sort of pay attention to that this is the idea of like I'm gonna

400
00:43:23.92 --> 00:43:29.36
run my car in the red until my car explodes and then I'm gonna be mad at the car I'm gonna blame the car

401
00:43:29.36 --> 00:43:36.64
and the disconnect of the and we like you said that the disconnect of the impact of the human

402
00:43:36.64 --> 00:43:42.88
being that that that that's what leaders are supposed to do that's their job is to and

403
00:43:42.88 --> 00:43:47.84
Dickwinner's had that he talked about the idea of like hey when when somebody puts their head in

404
00:43:47.84 --> 00:43:53.84
their hands that's they live a physical that literally showing you hey man I'm breaking right now

405
00:43:53.84 --> 00:44:02.16
and the willingness to just say go do it again and then get to the point like I can't let go

406
00:44:02.80 --> 00:44:08.000
we're done with you we don't have anymore use for you anymore yeah that's hard to comprehend

407
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.12
it's hard to comprehend it I'm I'm but like I said I'm prepping these books it's awful to read them

408
00:44:13.12 --> 00:44:18.08
it's awful to read them some of the murder the quotes from the soldiers that work chosen to be the

409
00:44:18.08 --> 00:44:24.48
executioners right I mean what what's that what's that I remember I started one podcast off with that

410
00:44:24.48 --> 00:44:29.12
was like these soldiers were picked to go this this kid had been in the army for a couple of weeks

411
00:44:29.12 --> 00:44:35.36
and he had to go shoot a diserter that was this one of his first assignments what the hell yeah so

412
00:44:36.32 --> 00:44:45.44
there's some kind of a some kind of a you know do we value human life more now that's the question

413
00:44:45.44 --> 00:44:52.72
I think the answer if you compare today compared to World War One the answer is 100% yes without

414
00:44:52.72 --> 00:44:59.12
a doubt 100% yes we do we do in the military we do and we do everywhere I think we absolutely do

415
00:45:00.32 --> 00:45:05.76
you got a nice long history of podcasts that are just sort of soul crushing you know you

416
00:45:05.76 --> 00:45:09.84
you've you've hit some real home runs there with some some podcasts you're like wow that is

417
00:45:09.84 --> 00:45:17.20
that is hard but you know what the reason that we hold human life in greater value now

418
00:45:17.52 --> 00:45:23.12
is because of that is because of those stories because this letter I mean there's that that small

419
00:45:23.12 --> 00:45:28.64
piece of having to understand that we are here because of where we came from we are here because of

420
00:45:28.64 --> 00:45:33.76
what we did and what we endured and that's not to say we won't go back to do that again that doesn't

421
00:45:33.76 --> 00:45:39.76
mean that we can't end up back in that place but those those stories that that legacy of that

422
00:45:39.76 --> 00:45:48.32
just crazy impossible to understand how you can do that to that many people and just say that's

423
00:45:48.32 --> 00:45:56.08
just how we do business that's just what we do we have come a long way and I think we've moved

424
00:45:56.08 --> 00:46:05.76
in the right direction now there is a piece that when people go to war people die oh yeah you know

425
00:46:05.76 --> 00:46:13.52
that's and we we can't get to a place or to a point or to a belief in our society where

426
00:46:13.52 --> 00:46:20.16
that is not acceptable that it's that is not something we're willing to have happened or an order

427
00:46:20.16 --> 00:46:24.88
for us to be successful that that is not okay to get to point that any loss of life or any

428
00:46:24.88 --> 00:46:33.04
injury or any sacrifice is not okay we can't get to that point so over shooting that is not

429
00:46:33.04 --> 00:46:39.12
good either I wouldn't use World War I as a benchmark you know that's just it's not even close but

430
00:46:39.68 --> 00:46:47.04
the reality is is that that's not just how war is but that's actually necessary and that's a

431
00:46:47.84 --> 00:46:54.000
as a leader that's a huge burden that's a huge burden and the burden is to balance the the

432
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.92
responsibility that you have to do everything to ensure that doesn't happen to your people knowing

433
00:46:59.92 --> 00:47:09.04
for well knowing for well that it will and I'll be really did I'll be really honest with you

434
00:47:11.44 --> 00:47:24.56
I did not when I went to Iraq I did not really grasp that it might happen to my guys

435
00:47:24.56 --> 00:47:35.68
I just didn't and I just didn't give it enough thought that the risk was actually going to end up

436
00:47:37.12 --> 00:47:42.80
with me and my guys and that Chris was going to get killed and I looked back on that as a leader and I

437
00:47:43.36 --> 00:47:47.92
I should have thought about that more I should have prepared for that more and I should have known

438
00:47:47.92 --> 00:47:57.20
what that meant more than I did and the reality is is that anybody in this business that goes to

439
00:47:57.20 --> 00:48:04.48
combat in any shape or form has to be prepared for that and to recognize that that is what happens

440
00:48:04.48 --> 00:48:09.84
in combat and that your job as a leader is to to everything you can to prevent it knowing

441
00:48:09.84 --> 00:48:15.04
full well that that is going to happen that's what happens how long to take you once you are on the

442
00:48:15.04 --> 00:48:24.88
ground in Ramadi not long so so the sledgehammer for me I mean I will never forget the day

443
00:48:25.52 --> 00:48:34.40
on the ever forget June 20th ever the sledgehammer for me was the first day I got there the guy that I was

444
00:48:34.40 --> 00:48:44.000
replacing got in a humvee hit an ID he was woony buddy broke both of his legs in a humvee that I was

445
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.68
supposed to take from him we were supposed to do the turnover of that humvee and obviously not getting

446
00:48:47.68 --> 00:48:53.04
that vehicle because it got blown up but it was a major in the Marine Corps and it was like

447
00:48:53.04 --> 00:49:02.40
majors and a major aviator in the Marine Corps got blown up by an ID so I got up to speed very quickly

448
00:49:02.40 --> 00:49:08.56
and that place had an ability to get you to be aware of the reality but very fast so I think I got

449
00:49:08.56 --> 00:49:14.72
there very fast day one something happened but the anticipation of that getting there that was kind

450
00:49:14.72 --> 00:49:23.36
of a sledgehammer for me what about reading reports when you're going in so I we talked about

451
00:49:23.36 --> 00:49:28.24
the last time my best friend was in Ramadi Neil yeah Neil Neil was in Ramadi and third

452
00:49:28.24 --> 00:49:34.08
times seven Marines so make no mistake Joko I objectively understood what was going on I mean

453
00:49:34.08 --> 00:49:39.52
I I was aware I knew I was getting myself into when I asked to go on that fact to her to Ramadi but

454
00:49:40.48 --> 00:49:47.36
the disconnect was what it meant it's sort of like the same disconnect that we were talking about

455
00:49:47.36 --> 00:49:53.04
when you read these books yeah like your reading reports but you're not there mentally well look

456
00:49:55.04 --> 00:50:00.80
combat for me was dropping a bomb in Iraq you know and Afghanistan was a certainly more aggressive

457
00:50:00.80 --> 00:50:05.68
experience for me you know it was a lot more regular pace there was certainly some risk involved

458
00:50:08.64 --> 00:50:12.32
but you've talked about the first combat experience on this podcast a lot we've talked about just

459
00:50:12.32 --> 00:50:21.28
the first combat experience as well I did not really get it until I saw it and actually in

460
00:50:21.28 --> 00:50:26.72
some ways you could say I didn't get it till I heard it you know the sounds of combat what it really

461
00:50:26.72 --> 00:50:32.88
sounds like to have a bullet go past your head so close to you can actually sort of gauge how close

462
00:50:32.88 --> 00:50:37.52
it was to your head and whether it was closer to the guy next to you three feet away closer to you

463
00:50:37.52 --> 00:50:42.000
who was the sniper actually looking I've had those thoughts I know you have too so the sights of the

464
00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:50.08
sounds of that it's just it's hard to replicate and I've actually been in MBS you've talked about

465
00:50:50.08 --> 00:50:54.000
the training that you did for your guys at task in bruising some of the things you did I didn't

466
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.32
do a lot of those things you know and I I showed up and look this is no criticism I'm I

467
00:50:58.32 --> 00:51:03.12
thrown ahead of anybody this is just the way it was I got to that that that you know that I

468
00:51:03.12 --> 00:51:07.84
deployed with I I showed up in October I did some training I kind of really joined the unit in

469
00:51:07.84 --> 00:51:12.72
earnest in like January and I was in a Romadi in February we kind of you sort of laughed at me last

470
00:51:12.72 --> 00:51:23.76
time I shot my rifle in training once I I BZO I oriented my sights on my rifle when I got

471
00:51:23.76 --> 00:51:28.64
to Romadi you know and that that training range they had just on the outside and and made sure my

472
00:51:28.64 --> 00:51:34.000
sights were in good shape before I went out on my first patrol the next day so in a lot of ways I was

473
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:40.32
just kind of in over my head with what that was and then on that deployment it just crazy yeah it's

474
00:51:40.32 --> 00:51:46.16
crazy and it happened so there was you know that's the sort of the the trial by fire story I mean

475
00:51:46.16 --> 00:51:53.36
it that's what it was for me but I will say this I got at the speed quickly in the rate that

476
00:51:53.36 --> 00:51:58.08
recognition the reality and look people were we're getting wounded people getting killed pretty

477
00:51:58.08 --> 00:52:02.08
regularly that you can see like man that's that's close that's real that's on the street I've been

478
00:52:02.08 --> 00:52:08.40
on that's an up patrol I've done that's an upheaval that I've maned so I I got to that point

479
00:52:08.40 --> 00:52:17.36
very quickly and the lessons that I had grown up with as a leader the way that I I was as a

480
00:52:17.36 --> 00:52:24.08
leader I was able to leverage that they they still worked leadership and combat it's it's

481
00:52:24.08 --> 00:52:29.60
certainly more dynamic it it will certainly strike more figuring you but the principles don't change

482
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:36.48
and I was old enough and mature enough and I had enough under my belt to say okay I need to control

483
00:52:36.48 --> 00:52:40.24
this I need to control how I react in this setting and I need to do what I do and I need to do the

484
00:52:40.24 --> 00:52:46.16
things that I know what I need to do and I was lucky enough to be able to do that and keep my you

485
00:52:46.16 --> 00:52:49.36
know my wherewithal and not get overwhelmed by it and I saw guys get overwhelmed by it here

486
00:52:49.36 --> 00:52:52.88
and there it was a place that that could do that to you but I was able to fall back on

487
00:52:54.40 --> 00:52:59.44
leadership principles how you lead to Marines were you were did you think mentally right the

488
00:52:59.44 --> 00:53:05.84
mental game of being able to attach being able to take a step back and as a fighter pilot did you

489
00:53:05.84 --> 00:53:11.20
just say oh this is what it's like as a fighter pilot this is what it's like oh I remember it's like

490
00:53:11.20 --> 00:53:14.64
for the landing on an aircraft carrier I'm going to be stressed out what I need to overcome that

491
00:53:14.64 --> 00:53:19.60
did you supply the same mechanisms to all right now I'm going to be stepping fruit on the battlefield

492
00:53:19.60 --> 00:53:24.56
and this is how I need to apply the same mentality the same mechanisms I had enough experience

493
00:53:24.56 --> 00:53:29.92
of being scared and controlling the fear that comes along with things that are scary that

494
00:53:31.04 --> 00:53:34.88
it looked different it smelled different it sounded different but the feeling was exactly the same

495
00:53:35.68 --> 00:53:39.36
is that makes sense yeah so that's what I was like I said that's why it's a saltball because I'm

496
00:53:39.36 --> 00:53:45.84
imagining that you know even even for us okay so let's say free fall like you're going to free fall

497
00:53:45.84 --> 00:53:51.52
well you're jumping out of an airplane and I I was I thought I would be more scared the first time

498
00:53:51.52 --> 00:53:56.48
I jumped out of an airplane but I was actually pretty pumped so that's not a great example but

499
00:53:56.48 --> 00:54:00.48
there's times in the sealed things where you do something in training where you're like okay this

500
00:54:00.48 --> 00:54:06.48
is a little bit sketch right this is a little bit sketch and you know what do you do you do the

501
00:54:06.48 --> 00:54:10.72
same thing you know okay this is what I'm going to do I've practiced it I've rehearsed it I'm going

502
00:54:10.72 --> 00:54:15.20
to I'm going to execute this thing and we're going to make it happen and you learn how to do that so

503
00:54:15.20 --> 00:54:22.48
when you get in combat you have a protocol to follow to take that's really if you're good now

504
00:54:22.48 --> 00:54:28.24
you know we see people that they they they have the protocol and they aren't able to apply it

505
00:54:28.24 --> 00:54:35.20
to the situation yeah I I never really freaked out when I was there the reality was oh

506
00:54:35.20 --> 00:54:39.84
this is a lot closer to me than I thought it was going to be the reality was it hit me harder than

507
00:54:39.84 --> 00:54:44.72
I expected in my preparation you know wasn't where it needed to be to be ready for it when I got there

508
00:54:45.28 --> 00:54:50.64
I knew that feeling and I felt that several times in my career and the response to it is it's all the same

509
00:54:51.20 --> 00:54:58.96
and one of the best things about responding to those situations is that as a leader you're really busy

510
00:54:59.52 --> 00:55:03.68
there's a lot to do you you've got a lot going on a lot of decision you have to make a lot of things

511
00:55:03.68 --> 00:55:09.04
you have to be aware of and that's actually one of the best remedies for all that and you know it's

512
00:55:09.04 --> 00:55:13.28
probably really tough for someone it really junior in the organization that may feel like it doesn't

513
00:55:13.28 --> 00:55:18.56
know what's going on doesn't have a real sense of those things I was never really bored yeah you know

514
00:55:18.56 --> 00:55:23.92
I mean it's time you have a lot of time now I I I know the feeling I've had I felt that feeling

515
00:55:23.92 --> 00:55:27.36
and it's like man this is a lot different I'm in a humvy I can't see things I'm used to being

516
00:55:27.36 --> 00:55:31.20
able to see my situation awareness is different how I gather information all that is different

517
00:55:31.20 --> 00:55:35.12
because the environment is different the feeling the same in the response to the same and like I said I

518
00:55:35.12 --> 00:55:40.08
had the luxury if you want to call that I was always busy I was that stuff going on I had always

519
00:55:40.08 --> 00:55:43.68
things to do I never I didn't just sit there and think wow this is terrifying and scary and I don't

520
00:55:43.68 --> 00:55:50.72
know what to do it's in the aftermath I look back at man that was that was crazy you know I remember

521
00:55:50.72 --> 00:55:56.80
I have this very vivid memory of of doing what we call them presence patrols so we take a

522
00:55:56.80 --> 00:56:01.68
couple of humvies and cruise around and in this case it was the town I was called to me I was a little

523
00:56:01.68 --> 00:56:06.56
town in in Romani there on the south side and just a nasty place just not a good place and

524
00:56:07.28 --> 00:56:12.16
a presence patrol is really just you just wait and get shot at and we would weave in and out of

525
00:56:12.16 --> 00:56:16.16
of the the streets and you know the buildings are two three stories high and we pulled up to an

526
00:56:16.16 --> 00:56:20.08
intersection where we're the second vehicle and this two vehicle patrol and the vehicle turns into

527
00:56:20.08 --> 00:56:25.28
a suit of vehicle from yet two vehicles yeah get some yeah we're number two that's get some the first

528
00:56:25.28 --> 00:56:30.40
vehicle makes it right hand turn as soon as you turn's right down with an RPG I can see him up you

529
00:56:30.40 --> 00:56:36.000
know right in my 12 o'clock position and it goes over the hood of our vehicle hits the wall

530
00:56:36.80 --> 00:56:43.20
it doesn't detonate but I think I might have mentioned this before and I'm just yelling go go go go go

531
00:56:44.32 --> 00:56:47.76
and those are the stories that in the after when you look back in the after him like man that was

532
00:56:47.76 --> 00:56:52.88
crazy but at the time you don't really spend a lot of time yeah you're saying you're yeah you're like

533
00:56:52.88 --> 00:56:55.92
oh you're gonna go to the right hey and you're on the radio he wears the other vehicle hey this

534
00:56:55.92 --> 00:56:59.04
is which is how you you're you're talking you're communicating you're doing all things you're supposed

535
00:56:59.04 --> 00:57:02.72
to do so you can look back on those things and a lot of them to look back on like man that was

536
00:57:02.72 --> 00:57:07.76
out of control that was nuts or but during those times even some of those those terrifying

537
00:57:07.76 --> 00:57:12.16
experiences I was just too busy to really worry about it and I was making decisions and

538
00:57:13.04 --> 00:57:18.16
I think as a leader that's that's actually good because I don't want to sit there and think

539
00:57:18.16 --> 00:57:21.28
about all these things that are scary me I want to just respond to it and just make a decision

540
00:57:21.28 --> 00:57:26.24
and do something and I actually had a lot of time in my career where I was I got very

541
00:57:26.24 --> 00:57:30.24
comfortable making decisions and difficult environments very quickly that's aviation and a nutshell

542
00:57:31.44 --> 00:57:35.12
and so I think I was able to adapt to that very quick and that's part of the reason why I was

543
00:57:35.12 --> 00:57:38.88
able to get through that deployment the way that I did you know I had some decompression we

544
00:57:38.88 --> 00:57:44.64
talked about that after after the fact but not a lot while I was there did you were punch out of your

545
00:57:45.20 --> 00:57:51.20
aircraft the every jacks no is that just luck yeah I mean some of it's beyond your control

546
00:57:51.20 --> 00:58:01.28
and it's pretty rare it doesn't happen all that often but not me thank god yeah check you know

547
00:58:01.28 --> 00:58:06.40
one of the things you were talking about you know well you basically went on a whole

548
00:58:07.52 --> 00:58:13.60
comment there about you know you got a your situation going back to the original subject here

549
00:58:14.16 --> 00:58:18.48
as a leader you're in this situation where you're going to take these guys that you care about

550
00:58:18.48 --> 00:58:25.12
and you're going to do everything to protect and you're regardless of how much you want to protect them

551
00:58:25.12 --> 00:58:30.000
they're you're gonna put them in situations where they can get killed and that that the

552
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:36.48
new book coming out the first chapter is called the ultimate dichotomy it's what it's called

553
00:58:36.48 --> 00:58:40.96
it's the ultimate dichotomy and there's a reason because that is the ultimate dichotomy there's no

554
00:58:40.96 --> 00:58:45.28
that for a leader as far as I'm concerned that is the absolute hardest thing that you have to

555
00:58:45.28 --> 00:58:50.32
deal with as a leader yeah the fact that you care about these guys it's your all you've been taught all

556
00:58:50.32 --> 00:58:56.56
you believe all you think all your your your morals and your values are all these for these guys

557
00:58:56.56 --> 00:59:03.60
that are doing anything for you and you'll do anything for them and you know their families and you

558
00:59:03.60 --> 00:59:11.12
know their kids and it's like yeah I guess what take all that and now you're gonna send them on missions

559
00:59:11.12 --> 00:59:18.96
where there is no doubt that they can get wounded or they can get killed you met Marcos at

560
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:26.000
at the master we talked about him earlier and this is a kid that would have done

561
00:59:26.96 --> 00:59:33.20
anything for me to this day he would do anything for me this is a kid that loves me how

562
00:59:33.20 --> 00:59:39.12
love this kid to and that's that feeling that is very hard to explain if you haven't gone through it

563
00:59:39.12 --> 00:59:47.20
and it's very hard to describe how powerful that is every single day I threw Marcos in the

564
00:59:47.20 --> 00:59:51.20
turret of my humby stuck his head up you know it was an armor humby was great but at the end of the

565
00:59:51.20 --> 00:59:55.44
day you know what the turret gonna have to do it's got to get his head up out of the turret and man

566
00:59:55.44 --> 01:00:03.04
that 240 gaw for 50 cow whatever we had on that on any given day and stick his head out of that humby

567
01:00:03.04 --> 01:00:12.48
every single day and I thought about that all the time all the time and it is exactly what you just

568
01:00:12.48 --> 01:00:17.04
described this is someone that would have done anything for me this is someone that I loved and

569
01:00:17.04 --> 01:00:25.92
would have done anything for and every day it was get in the turret and let's go that's what you do

570
01:00:26.48 --> 01:00:30.32
and you do everything you can to prepare them and every you can to make sure it doesn't happen

571
01:00:30.32 --> 01:00:35.28
and the last thing you tell him is hey get up there we gotta go we gotta go do this no just can you

572
01:00:35.28 --> 01:00:40.96
even fathom can you even fathom that that happens and you do it for months and you do it for months

573
01:00:40.96 --> 01:00:47.12
and you do it for a year and finally he says you know what I can't do this anymore and then you said you know what okay

574
01:00:48.48 --> 01:00:52.32
we're pressing charges against you you're going to court Marshall we find you guilty

575
01:00:54.16 --> 01:00:58.88
that's insane and and to take it a step further we're gonna get somebody else in my unit

576
01:00:58.88 --> 01:01:04.24
to pull the trigger we're gonna get another guy from this unit from this baton this from this team to

577
01:01:04.24 --> 01:01:10.48
follow through with that order it's it's not actually no I can't comprehend that I can't understand that

578
01:01:12.32 --> 01:01:18.56
I can't I can't either I mean I'm like I said I'm doing a podcast about it in the near future

579
01:01:19.04 --> 01:01:27.60
but for the love of God that's a trajectory it's it's thank God being in this time period

580
01:01:27.60 --> 01:01:36.000
yeah yeah and and we could talk about this stuff for days you've talked about it you just the last podcast

581
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.40
with the Imperial Japanese doing those experiments we talked about the dehumanization

582
01:01:41.44 --> 01:01:47.76
and look obviously it's it's grotesque but the dehumanization of your enemy

583
01:01:49.12 --> 01:01:55.28
I understand how that happens I can I can understand that we don't get there yeah I can

584
01:01:55.28 --> 01:01:59.12
see how people can get there yeah I can see that and I know that I know the seeds of how

585
01:01:59.12 --> 01:02:03.60
that grows and I know that feeling I have that feeling grows over time of of that disdain

586
01:02:03.60 --> 01:02:08.56
and that dehumanization that I said I would never have happened to me and I felt and I know that feeling

587
01:02:08.56 --> 01:02:13.28
so I my point is that well if you've ever heard me say with our enemy we didn't really have to dehumanize

588
01:02:13.28 --> 01:02:18.56
them because they dehumanized themselves we saw what they did we saw the acted yeah and what they did

589
01:02:18.56 --> 01:02:24.32
to the civilized yes absolutely absolutely you you dehumanized yourselves and you're going to

590
01:02:24.32 --> 01:02:29.60
suffer the consequences of that yep and so that's a bridge in my mind I can cross I understand that

591
01:02:30.48 --> 01:02:37.52
I don't understand how you can get to a point where the value of the human life of your own men

592
01:02:38.80 --> 01:02:44.88
is that you just discard them at the end like oh you're done got it line them up

593
01:02:45.92 --> 01:02:53.20
and that to me is kind of horrifying because I you know how to small unit I don't have a big unit

594
01:02:53.20 --> 01:02:57.52
and I certainly knew my guys pretty well and and maybe you only have a you know a huge unit of

595
01:02:57.52 --> 01:03:00.40
a bunch of unnamed people you don't build strong relationship but at the end of the day they're

596
01:03:00.40 --> 01:03:05.20
wearing your uniform and the end of the day they're they look sound talk and are just like you

597
01:03:05.20 --> 01:03:12.24
lot of them come to the same places you and that's really difficult to accept that human beings

598
01:03:12.24 --> 01:03:18.000
or capable of doing that like I said when it's your enemy or it's when it's someone that's

599
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.24
different than you you at least can comprehend that and you see we've seen that in history but

600
01:03:22.24 --> 01:03:30.000
your your own guys that's that's a different level it's a different time period yep

601
01:03:31.44 --> 01:03:38.64
so going back to or not going back to you but going forward right you got out of the Marine Corps

602
01:03:38.64 --> 01:03:43.20
and obviously we covered a little bit on the last podcast we covered about you know we didn't

603
01:03:43.20 --> 01:03:48.80
we kind of read the text last time you were on the podcast of kind of how the transition you know

604
01:03:48.80 --> 01:03:55.44
you got out you came to an event with Lafin Eye and we hung out and you were sinking yourself

605
01:03:55.44 --> 01:04:04.000
yeah this looks like what I want to do but there's been more to it than that that you've kind

606
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:11.84
of briefed me on a little bit yeah how much time we got yeah there's there's a lot more to it

607
01:04:11.84 --> 01:04:22.48
the work that we do is awesome and I wrote you a letter several months ago now but I wrote

608
01:04:22.48 --> 01:04:26.80
your letter kind of in some ways you know some ways like hey thank you for bringing me part of

609
01:04:26.80 --> 01:04:31.68
this team and and there was you know I wanted to express some some gratitude and I did that

610
01:04:31.68 --> 01:04:36.16
to everybody to have been brought into something that that is really incredible and and and I wanted

611
01:04:36.16 --> 01:04:45.68
that to be clear but I also wanted to kind of explain what I was going through is part of the transition

612
01:04:46.80 --> 01:04:54.24
and what has hit me the hardest is not the things that I expected to happen that have happened

613
01:04:54.24 --> 01:04:58.48
and looks and really good things have happened this is an awesome company we do great things

614
01:04:58.48 --> 01:05:03.28
and I get to make an impact and I love being a part of this and I saw it so I sort of expected

615
01:05:03.28 --> 01:05:09.36
to be able to do that and be a part of that and and see the impact of that but I didn't give

616
01:05:09.36 --> 01:05:16.56
much thought at the time to how is it impact me and what the impact of being a part of this

617
01:05:16.56 --> 01:05:23.28
would mean for for my growth and for myself I think we just talked about this earlier today when

618
01:05:25.12 --> 01:05:30.000
I get introduced to these events all the time and they read my bio sometimes and I hear the

619
01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.44
words of what we're doing and everything and what I've done and and I was at a point that I

620
01:05:35.44 --> 01:05:42.96
can look back and very easily think that I could have coasted I could have said hey I I I

621
01:05:42.96 --> 01:05:47.20
I did some good work in the Marine Corps I got a really cool resume and I've kind of got it

622
01:05:47.20 --> 01:05:51.52
figured out I don't have that much more to learn and I'm going to kind of I'm going to kind of go

623
01:05:51.52 --> 01:05:59.52
straight level for a while and the biggest part of this transition for me is the recognition

624
01:06:01.36 --> 01:06:08.000
that what I have done to this point what I accomplished as a Marine and and the things that I did

625
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:19.92
is a pilot it doesn't matter it doesn't matter because if I cash in now and I check in the box

626
01:06:19.92 --> 01:06:27.60
and I'm done and I and I coast from now I'll define my life by having coasted for the rest of my life

627
01:06:28.72 --> 01:06:36.000
and I wasn't really prepared for having to recognize of how much more there is for me to learn

628
01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:46.40
and how much more there is for me to do and that has been by far the best and the most humbling part

629
01:06:46.40 --> 01:06:52.96
about this and you got you know me at this point you know me well enough that I'm not afraid to admit

630
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.88
things that are kind of hard to admit I'm not afraid to kind of humble myself I'm not afraid to say

631
01:06:58.88 --> 01:07:07.92
why I got that wrong I didn't see that coming this transition has been way way more than I thought

632
01:07:07.92 --> 01:07:13.20
it was going to be and in some ways it's actually put me on my heels a little bit it's been a reminder

633
01:07:13.20 --> 01:07:20.64
that man I'm not even close to doing the things that I want to do before I'm done I'm not even close

634
01:07:20.64 --> 01:07:25.28
and that's that's a hard feeling sometimes it's actually I struggle that a little bit

635
01:07:26.88 --> 01:07:30.80
because a lot of the times people around me tell me I've done great things and I hear that a lot

636
01:07:30.80 --> 01:07:37.60
and it's great to hear but I'm not even close man and and that is something I struggle with every

637
01:07:37.60 --> 01:07:48.40
day and I work out every day and I I have a lot a lot to do. I don't think that you you didn't get

638
01:07:48.40 --> 01:07:53.52
to where you were without feeling that right yeah you don't get to you don't get to be you know

639
01:07:53.52 --> 01:07:59.44
all the things that you did and your big bio without saying without without having in the

640
01:07:59.44 --> 01:08:05.92
back your mind like I need to do more and I need to do better right yeah that's true that that is true

641
01:08:05.92 --> 01:08:18.64
but the magnitude of of it it gets bigger over time it doesn't get smaller the magnitude continues to grow

642
01:08:18.64 --> 01:08:25.04
oh I know this is like when you start to jitz it and you're like well you know what you give me a few

643
01:08:25.04 --> 01:08:31.36
weeks yeah you know I'm like two or three months I'll probably be tapping this guy out yeah and then

644
01:08:31.36 --> 01:08:37.52
no oh two weeks into you're going oh my god there's a whole another thing here yeah that might be

645
01:08:37.52 --> 01:08:43.76
one of the best metaphors for it you know that that that experience look the jitz it things started

646
01:08:43.76 --> 01:08:49.60
because and on the podcast I was describing the last podcast I was describing flying to you

647
01:08:49.60 --> 01:08:53.92
I was describing dogfighting you know like dude that sounds exactly like jitz dude that's kind of

648
01:08:53.92 --> 01:08:58.48
what spark my interest was is there a way to kind of replicate those experiences that I had that I

649
01:08:58.48 --> 01:09:02.56
know I can't do an airplane anymore but can I can I replicate that in some other way and that was

650
01:09:02.56 --> 01:09:09.84
what was intriguing to me and that was what got me on the path of that but look I heard he said this

651
01:09:09.84 --> 01:09:15.12
I didn't think the magnitude of the panic of oh god I'm running out of time I have so much more

652
01:09:15.12 --> 01:09:23.20
to do was going to get bigger over time and that is sort of what like jitzu is is and and I again

653
01:09:23.20 --> 01:09:29.36
I think we've had this conversation well I've made fun of you on this podcast when you weren't here

654
01:09:29.36 --> 01:09:36.56
of you be you know you sent me a text like bro I'm I'm the horrible I'm like oh what's what's going on

655
01:09:36.56 --> 01:09:42.96
you're like well I I'm never going to be like really really really good at jitzu yeah you know like

656
01:09:42.96 --> 01:09:48.80
I think man you're whatever you're 46 years old you know get good yeah get good it's all good yeah

657
01:09:48.80 --> 01:09:55.52
no certainly I think the the messages and and the lesson for me is is a reminder of something

658
01:09:55.52 --> 01:10:00.24
I did know something I have known throughout my life of that feeling of the clock is running

659
01:10:00.24 --> 01:10:04.56
you're on the clock right now you don't know when that clock's gonna end but I'm gonna tell you

660
01:10:04.56 --> 01:10:10.88
around you're on it and every second that you're not grinding on that clock you lose it and

661
01:10:12.56 --> 01:10:18.000
there's a point where complacency will try to sneak in the complacency will try to crawl up and go

662
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:26.40
dude you've been crushing it look at what you've done and that voice can kind of get loud and

663
01:10:26.40 --> 01:10:29.84
they can kind of tell you like dude it's time to kind of turn the corner and coast a little bit kind

664
01:10:29.84 --> 01:10:34.72
of kind of glide just a little bit you're good and I think the best thing that's happened to me is

665
01:10:34.72 --> 01:10:43.68
that exposure to echelon front exposure to to to the to the to the team and exposure to jiu jitsu

666
01:10:43.68 --> 01:10:49.28
in a way of not like all my going to be some world champion and it's that bro the more you know

667
01:10:49.28 --> 01:10:56.08
the more you learn the less you actually know because learning just means like oh there's more out there

668
01:10:56.72 --> 01:11:03.92
so you go from one to two but what's available is a hundred to a thousand and you get to three

669
01:11:03.92 --> 01:11:09.52
and a thousand turns into ten thousand and jiu jitsu's infinite and so every time I get to whatever

670
01:11:09.52 --> 01:11:14.08
the next step is the next level all it really does is it's just somebody's opening door go oh it's actually

671
01:11:14.08 --> 01:11:20.16
bigger so it's almost like you're getting worse you know if you do the math like now at level four

672
01:11:20.16 --> 01:11:25.92
out of a million you're like there you just like yesterday there was only four moves yes it's no yeah

673
01:11:25.92 --> 01:11:29.76
yeah that's exactly right today there's 40 moves I don't know yeah and the other thing is

674
01:11:30.56 --> 01:11:38.32
from from okay for our dog fighting in an aircraft right it seems like there would be some

675
01:11:38.32 --> 01:11:43.20
limitation without a doubt okay and we haven't we you and I have not had this conversation but

676
01:11:43.20 --> 01:11:49.44
I've had those thoughts they're absolutely absolutely is a limit there's only so many things that you can do

677
01:11:50.88 --> 01:11:58.24
and that's actually not true yeah you know and and an aircraft you know just just by

678
01:11:58.24 --> 01:12:03.76
constraints of time I mean you can't you can't go up and dog fight for four hours a day every now

679
01:12:03.76 --> 01:12:08.96
you do that in top gone for for a few years but the opponents that you have well I guess you're

680
01:12:08.96 --> 01:12:13.36
going to get to the start that's that's as good as you're going to get yeah but jitsu you can do that for

681
01:12:14.24 --> 01:12:18.40
20 years the parallels are undeniable the parallels and you saw that right away you and I talked

682
01:12:18.40 --> 01:12:22.80
about that there's no question that has been the most intriguing thing for me is that it's I'm

683
01:12:22.80 --> 01:12:33.36
able to replicate those feelings but the unlimited nature of how if a once out there if I had a guy

684
01:12:33.36 --> 01:12:37.12
in a hornet that I was going to do to be a femme with and he was we were going to do these

685
01:12:37.12 --> 01:12:43.60
this maneuvers and he'd be like I like to do this when I'm defensive and it wasn't exactly what he

686
01:12:43.60 --> 01:12:48.40
supposed to do he was going to lose every single time like oh you're not going to do the best

687
01:12:48.40 --> 01:12:56.80
method in this situation good I'm going to savage you do jitsu is not like that yeah if there is no

688
01:12:56.80 --> 01:13:03.92
this is what works and everything else is inferior and we have the geometry we have the math we have

689
01:13:03.92 --> 01:13:08.96
the science the physics and we actually at top gone through a ton of effort and try to matter

690
01:13:08.96 --> 01:13:12.56
actually figure out this is what you need to do here this how you create the most amount of

691
01:13:12.56 --> 01:13:16.64
closure these are all the things you do to maximize your aircraft and so if somebody deviates from that

692
01:13:17.04 --> 01:13:23.84
it's just better for you that's not true yeah that's not that's it's there's like it's been so

693
01:13:23.84 --> 01:13:27.36
broken down and so study that there's no possibility that someone could come up with something

694
01:13:27.36 --> 01:13:34.32
ago oh I came up with something new not happening no not and and when you're in top gun when you're

695
01:13:34.32 --> 01:13:40.72
top gun I would love to somebody to try something new yeah go for it yeah do your works

696
01:13:40.72 --> 01:13:45.76
do you come up with your best game plan because I know what you need to do in this situation

697
01:13:45.76 --> 01:13:49.60
and if you don't do that you're just giving me the opportunity that's what you're doing and so

698
01:13:49.60 --> 01:13:54.80
there is a level of that in jujitsu where you know all the gun put your arms up there's all

699
01:13:54.80 --> 01:13:59.36
that you're going to give up your back there's all these things that you can't do but for instance

700
01:13:59.36 --> 01:14:04.64
Jeffy Glover he'll give up his back and then he's rolling away from you or Dean Lister he's

701
01:14:04.64 --> 01:14:08.48
you're getting him in a triangle you think and then you're getting your guard past you're getting

702
01:14:08.48 --> 01:14:15.20
smashed so there's there's times where the things that you don't expect someone to do they do

703
01:14:15.20 --> 01:14:22.24
and it's problematic yeah and and I want to be very careful I'm I'm so new at this that I

704
01:14:22.24 --> 01:14:28.80
almost should not have been telling you what I think I know about this but the glide path to get from

705
01:14:29.52 --> 01:14:38.56
seeing the inside of an F-18 for the first time to being right at the very apex of that community

706
01:14:38.56 --> 01:14:45.84
six seven years oh really yeah about seven years from I'm going to introduce you to this

707
01:14:45.84 --> 01:14:49.44
airplane now you know you know how to fly but now I'm going to introduce you to a combat

708
01:14:49.84 --> 01:14:53.36
aircraft for the first time in your life a real combat machine you're going to get in that thing

709
01:14:54.24 --> 01:15:00.80
I got there in 1998 first time I sat foot in an F-18 I got to top gun in 2000

710
01:15:00.80 --> 01:15:08.24
uh uh 2002 I left in 2005 so I would say I was kind of at my apex in 2005

711
01:15:08.24 --> 01:15:14.24
well so from 1998 to 2005 that's how long it took me to be at the top of of of that world

712
01:15:16.08 --> 01:15:20.80
am I going to can you imagine like the best guys in GD to the guys that are been doing

713
01:15:20.80 --> 01:15:25.36
for five to six years yeah well well what you have to do is you there's some anomalies out there

714
01:15:25.36 --> 01:15:29.28
yeah there's guys that are incredibly the current natural actually and also you have to take

715
01:15:29.28 --> 01:15:34.16
someone and say okay this is your job because that was your job that's a big piece hey this is your

716
01:15:34.16 --> 01:15:38.08
job and that happened some kids get into GD too and they're like oh I'm going to sleep on the

717
01:15:38.08 --> 01:15:42.80
mat all I'm going to do is train BJ fan got his back belt and did well did he win the world's

718
01:15:42.80 --> 01:15:49.12
in F-18 years I don't think so but you know in three years got his back belt and he was a legit

719
01:15:49.12 --> 01:15:54.16
black belt someone was asking on social media the other day hey is this guy legit he's he seems to

720
01:15:54.16 --> 01:15:58.96
have gotten his black belt got his black belt from dawn or her in a short period of time

721
01:15:58.96 --> 01:16:04.64
oh you mean the judo uh Olympia yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he might have some skills yeah

722
01:16:04.64 --> 01:16:09.92
he might be able to get up they're pretty quick yeah yes for that answer yes that dude is legit you

723
01:16:09.92 --> 01:16:14.96
get your black belt you can get your black belt pretty quickly if you have a bunch of

724
01:16:14.96 --> 01:16:19.60
natural talent maybe you have some kind of base wrestling judo something like that and then you make

725
01:16:19.60 --> 01:16:25.12
it your job you can get you can get really good really fast yeah but yeah basically if your mind is

726
01:16:25.12 --> 01:16:29.84
like addicted to it in one way or another and then you have some prerequisites like you know the

727
01:16:30.72 --> 01:16:36.72
geo and yeah the Martinez brothers they had breakdowns in that a lot of the same stuff you know

728
01:16:36.72 --> 01:16:43.12
and that kind of went along with their style I would go so far as to say this is this is a guess

729
01:16:44.80 --> 01:16:49.92
I would go so far as to say that most people that have their black belt in juditsu

730
01:16:49.92 --> 01:16:57.04
or in the obsessed mode at some point in their life makes sense that's what I'm going to say

731
01:16:57.04 --> 01:17:02.56
sure I cannot disagree with that right if you ever known someone that's a black belt that

732
01:17:02.56 --> 01:17:08.16
was not at least for a period of three years was just that's all they thought about I don't know

733
01:17:08.16 --> 01:17:13.76
of any no yeah they they were just into juditsu real hard go yeah and then maybe they

734
01:17:13.76 --> 01:17:19.36
grow out of a little bit or something whatever yeah somebody's just keep trained trained hard

735
01:17:21.52 --> 01:17:32.64
that's how it is one of the things that you did and this is going I hate to cycle back

736
01:17:32.64 --> 01:17:35.68
to the podcast again but I'm going to do it real quick because I had a had a note about it

737
01:17:36.80 --> 01:17:40.72
and it's something that you and I've talked about several times from Tom Fife came on the podcast

738
01:17:40.72 --> 01:17:46.000
purple heart you know served in world war two create Vietnam purple heart world war two

739
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:56.64
create Vietnam battalion commander in world war in Vietnam company commander in Korea and I think

740
01:17:56.64 --> 01:18:02.64
tag put in commander in order to tank put in commander in world war two so if that's your resume what's

741
01:18:02.64 --> 01:18:10.08
I'm sorry uh engineer and yeah that's right yeah and so so there's his resume but it was really

742
01:18:10.08 --> 01:18:15.92
interesting so when he came on the podcast and we were talking about you know leadership and

743
01:18:15.92 --> 01:18:22.40
stuff like that and he gives this answer of we were talking around the subject of you know how

744
01:18:22.40 --> 01:18:26.40
do you get someone you know how do you get your people listen to you and he says hey you tell

745
01:18:26.40 --> 01:18:32.80
to do it and they do it and I remember you and I talked in afterwards it was like man that was not a

746
01:18:33.52 --> 01:18:38.40
that was not a jocco answer of like hey you know hey listen you got a build relationship with

747
01:18:38.40 --> 01:18:42.08
people you got a you got to get their trust you got to earn their respect you got to you got to

748
01:18:42.08 --> 01:18:47.68
treat them how you want to be treated and then if you explain to them why the mission is important

749
01:18:47.68 --> 01:18:52.000
and they believe in the mission and they know that you're going to back them up then they're

750
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.56
going to back you up when you need that but do something like I have this whole thing right yeah

751
01:18:56.56 --> 01:19:05.12
this is big problem it's this big uh dance you got to go through as a leader and and I think

752
01:19:05.12 --> 01:19:09.04
to myself yeah I've got this figured out and so you guys know I tell people to do it I'm like man

753
01:19:10.16 --> 01:19:14.80
that's kind of it's kind of a bummer think of what I'm gonna tell echo to edit that out right

754
01:19:14.80 --> 01:19:22.24
just kidding but then this was the cool part was then he he continued to talk about it and he gave

755
01:19:22.64 --> 01:19:28.32
just the most perfect answer of the things that everything that we say all the time everything that

756
01:19:28.32 --> 01:19:33.28
we talk about national unfriend everything that I talk about in this podcast he gave it all yeah

757
01:19:33.28 --> 01:19:38.16
he he really just did it in reverse order of conversations we have we explained sometimes

758
01:19:38.16 --> 01:19:43.12
that in in really challenging environments sometimes you got to say hey go make this happen

759
01:19:43.76 --> 01:19:48.000
and you got to have your people say Roger that and they go make it happen you got to be able to do

760
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.88
that sometimes but the only way for that to work in those really demanding difficult challenging

761
01:19:52.88 --> 01:19:59.28
environments is to go way back before and build all those relationships and create all that

762
01:19:59.28 --> 01:20:03.52
trust and do all those things to when people go they've just said go make this happen go make it happen

763
01:20:03.52 --> 01:20:09.12
we'll ask questions later he just went to that part because I almost set it up for that because

764
01:20:09.12 --> 01:20:14.72
the question I was asking him was how do you get a guy to jump out of your tank under fire to fix

765
01:20:14.72 --> 01:20:21.36
the turd and his mind that's they like there's rounds hitting the tank yeah ping ping ping ping and

766
01:20:21.36 --> 01:20:26.80
the the tank track falls off and someone's got to get out there and fix it and he goes to the

767
01:20:26.80 --> 01:20:32.48
junior guy and he's like you got to get out there and fix it and so it was he just did that whole

768
01:20:32.48 --> 01:20:36.72
thing in reverse already went to that part and then and I remember thinking like and that's kind

769
01:20:36.72 --> 01:20:41.92
of a bummer answer I really wasn't expecting that it was like you just tell him what to do and then

770
01:20:41.92 --> 01:20:46.24
I didn't that work for me yeah I might have to change the way yeah so

771
01:20:47.84 --> 01:20:51.84
when he started to go and I remember that feeling of like oh and now he's starting to explain

772
01:20:51.84 --> 01:20:58.48
and I looked at you a couple times like yeah and he did the whole thing and he he he he speaks

773
01:20:58.48 --> 01:21:05.04
very plain language too and he just sort of distilled it all down is like you have to take care of

774
01:21:05.04 --> 01:21:10.88
your people you have to treat your people well and if you do they will do the same for you and if you

775
01:21:10.88 --> 01:21:17.36
don't yes what when you say jump out of the tank under fire they're gonna say no yeah that was the

776
01:21:17.36 --> 01:21:21.12
best part when he actually came all the way back out and said if you just think you're just gonna

777
01:21:21.12 --> 01:21:24.80
tell someone to get out of my tank under fire and they don't believe what's going on and they don't

778
01:21:24.80 --> 01:21:30.72
trust you and you haven't taken care of them they're not going anywhere yeah every time I hear

779
01:21:30.72 --> 01:21:37.52
all the people you've had on the podcast I know the stories are different but they're all saying

780
01:21:37.52 --> 01:21:42.72
the same thing they're all saying the same thing they're all little nuance way they're all

781
01:21:42.72 --> 01:21:47.36
experience but it's always the same thing and that was of all of my favorite because I got to

782
01:21:47.36 --> 01:21:52.72
know Tom before the podcast and we got to talk quite a bit and I got to spend time with him before

783
01:21:52.72 --> 01:22:00.16
we went live on that recording so I enjoyed that one the most but it's everybody's saying the same thing

784
01:22:00.16 --> 01:22:05.76
yeah a MOOC made a huge point about that about caring about your people yeah you got to care about your

785
01:22:05.76 --> 01:22:15.52
people again these are guys that were that were leading drafties via nom drafties and I went off

786
01:22:15.52 --> 01:22:21.84
of this event we were at the other day is there any more hostile workforce in in the hit okay

787
01:22:21.84 --> 01:22:26.40
maybe not the history of the world but is there this is right up there you've got guys that have

788
01:22:26.40 --> 01:22:30.40
been because it's you know if you're a world war two and you get drafted guess what the countries

789
01:22:30.40 --> 01:22:36.16
behind the war it's well wrote you're gonna be a hero you but you're fighting against Nazis or

790
01:22:36.16 --> 01:22:42.88
ja in period of Japanese that are evil humans and you're on board for the big win we get that

791
01:22:42.88 --> 01:22:48.40
that's what happens create not quite so clear but guess what we still even remember World War two

792
01:22:48.40 --> 01:22:54.08
so guess what we're gonna go get in the game yeah via nom they straight up don't believe in the war

793
01:22:54.64 --> 01:23:00.40
they just straight up don't believe in the war they're there against their will under threat of

794
01:23:00.40 --> 01:23:05.12
prison they show up there and these are the people you're in charge of and this is the answer I

795
01:23:05.12 --> 01:23:08.72
give all the time now for a moment when people ask me about millennia's people are like you know we

796
01:23:08.72 --> 01:23:15.20
we got millennials and they got a bad attitude oh really oh really the the millennials have a bad

797
01:23:15.20 --> 01:23:23.92
attitude compare that to a drafted Vietnam soldier and here's the thing that I realized because

798
01:23:23.92 --> 01:23:28.72
and when I pulled it when I started going through hack again about Facebook and I started reading that

799
01:23:29.76 --> 01:23:35.68
I realized that you got to change your perspective as a leader it's not just it's not just hey

800
01:23:35.68 --> 01:23:41.04
because we simplify it like well if your millennials aren't doing what you want it's your fault that's

801
01:23:41.04 --> 01:23:46.24
that's a simplification of it because what you really got to do is you got to shift your mindset a

802
01:23:46.24 --> 01:23:51.76
little bit and say like what wait a second how do I take advantage of that's what hack worth was

803
01:23:51.76 --> 01:23:56.40
doing hack worth was same wait a second how do I take advantage these guys guess what they're going to

804
01:23:56.40 --> 01:24:01.12
question me if I do something wrong they're going to report things that are done correctly they're

805
01:24:01.12 --> 01:24:06.88
going to say no if I plan something stupid is that a bad thing let me think about it actually no

806
01:24:06.88 --> 01:24:11.68
that's actually not a bad thing so if you've got a millennial that's like hey if I don't like

807
01:24:11.68 --> 01:24:17.52
the leadership here I'm leaving the company guess what let's get that person some good leadership

808
01:24:17.52 --> 01:24:22.16
you got a millennial that says hey if I don't understand why we're doing what we're doing I don't

809
01:24:22.16 --> 01:24:26.16
I don't care I'm not going to do it okay well let's explain to that person why so they have a full

810
01:24:26.16 --> 01:24:31.04
understanding of what it is we're trying to get done you shift your your mindset a little bit about

811
01:24:31.04 --> 01:24:35.84
the whole deal and you end up in a much better position but it's a perspective shift yeah you

812
01:24:35.84 --> 01:24:41.44
it's the same thing we always say of it's not just take ownership of it so it's if you if you say oh

813
01:24:41.44 --> 01:24:45.92
my millennials aren't doing what I need to do that's my fault that doesn't make them to start

814
01:24:45.92 --> 01:24:51.44
doing what you need them to do you actually have to make changes in your leadership style to

815
01:24:51.44 --> 01:24:57.28
adapt to this attitude that's coming your way and at the end of the day if you do that you'll have

816
01:24:57.28 --> 01:25:03.44
someone that's smart that's motivated that will get on board with the program and we'll do a great

817
01:25:03.44 --> 01:25:10.64
job yeah just like a draft just like a drafty and when when we see it in in leaders all the time

818
01:25:10.64 --> 01:25:18.48
they they present it like can't leave these people this is unsolvable problem it is a problem

819
01:25:18.48 --> 01:25:24.64
that the end we're we're going downhill it's supersonic speeds and when you do what you just said

820
01:25:24.64 --> 01:25:29.12
and turn it change that perspective and then put it in comparison to the story of the drafties

821
01:25:29.84 --> 01:25:35.36
they're almost a little embarrassed like oh yeah yeah that's one of those answers when I give

822
01:25:35.36 --> 01:25:41.84
that answer I I I have to soften it a little bit because I just can't he's come straight back like

823
01:25:41.84 --> 01:25:47.52
hey these guys were taking I don't I don't throw this in their face of like hey these guys

824
01:25:47.52 --> 01:25:53.28
were taking drafties that didn't even believe in the war yeah and we're gonna get killed yeah

825
01:25:53.28 --> 01:25:57.92
yeah like hey you're asking someone to stay late but Tuesday night yeah that's what you're asking

826
01:25:57.92 --> 01:26:04.08
work yeah they were asking them to patrol through a mine ridden jungle right not to mention this

827
01:26:04.08 --> 01:26:08.96
person is actually interviewed or your company applied for job wants to be there yeah there there's

828
01:26:08.96 --> 01:26:14.24
a clear difference in generation is something to think about but nobody force this person

829
01:26:14.24 --> 01:26:21.60
to join your team or friend yeah and you see that and the the the the when the recognition hits

830
01:26:21.60 --> 01:26:28.72
you can see it like oh yeah no you're right this is actually a very solvable problem it just

831
01:26:28.72 --> 01:26:35.20
takes a work on my part yeah and I mean I that's true with everything yeah we got I mean we obviously

832
01:26:35.20 --> 01:26:40.88
we have all kinds of companies out there that we work with now and their work forces now becoming

833
01:26:40.88 --> 01:26:46.16
all millennials right their front line people right now at a company the front line people are

834
01:26:46.16 --> 01:26:52.72
all millennials and so if you don't figure this out who who are you gonna hire yeah who are you

835
01:26:52.72 --> 01:26:56.48
gonna hire I mean it's like being a Vietnam you you're gonna have drafties if you don't figure that out

836
01:26:57.20 --> 01:27:03.12
and and that's the other thing is you hear the bad leaders from Vietnam that was that will say

837
01:27:03.12 --> 01:27:06.40
all the drafties were horrible I couldn't work with them they were you know they didn't do

838
01:27:06.40 --> 01:27:12.64
their job take them maybe you should look in the mirror a little bit yeah and the the the best

839
01:27:12.64 --> 01:27:18.56
part about that is when we asked same thing with Tom five yeah because he's like that's all that's

840
01:27:18.56 --> 01:27:23.04
all we ever had he's almost like an interesting the question yeah no that's yeah that was our military

841
01:27:23.04 --> 01:27:29.28
back then when I was in the when he was in the army it was like I didn't I couldn't tell you

842
01:27:29.28 --> 01:27:34.08
who was a drafty you know wasn't I didn't I didn't know the difference they they're people

843
01:27:34.08 --> 01:27:40.16
yeah they're human beings yeah and I treated him like that and so the just the idea that you would

844
01:27:40.16 --> 01:27:46.08
segregate those two the drafties and the and and the the volunteer military was immediate indication of

845
01:27:46.08 --> 01:27:50.08
what kind of leader you had yeah and these guys were like I don't at first I don't understand the

846
01:27:50.08 --> 01:27:55.68
question all we had was drafties at the time we everybody was being drafted and second didn't matter to me

847
01:27:55.68 --> 01:28:00.16
they didn't care I didn't care we had a mission to do I explained them the impact in the

848
01:28:00.16 --> 01:28:03.20
importance of the mission told them they're rolling that mission and what would happen if they did

849
01:28:03.20 --> 01:28:08.24
or didn't do it I cared about them and we just did it and that's my favorite part about Tom

850
01:28:08.24 --> 01:28:12.000
five is he's he's just a plain spoken guy he doesn't have this really flowery articulate language

851
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.76
he's like oh yeah I know I treated my people really well and when I asked him do something they

852
01:28:15.76 --> 01:28:20.72
did it that's kind of that's kind of it that's a pretty awesome leadership yeah advice

853
01:28:20.72 --> 01:28:26.32
it is to your people really well and when the time comes that you you do something that they

854
01:28:26.32 --> 01:28:29.68
need to do something for you they're gonna do it take care of your people and your people

855
01:28:29.68 --> 01:28:34.64
gonna take care of you yeah we said about our gear take your your gear take your gear take your

856
01:28:34.64 --> 01:28:38.32
yeah same thing take care of your people how about how about we start with that one yeah and then

857
01:28:38.32 --> 01:28:44.24
your people are gonna take care of you too yeah we I think we we forget those lessons sometimes you know

858
01:28:44.24 --> 01:28:48.40
we're like we're treated it's human capital like no they're they're people they're just people

859
01:28:49.36 --> 01:28:53.68
it's just treated like people treat them like you treat anybody else and you know some of those

860
01:28:53.68 --> 01:28:58.72
fundamental lessons you know across leadership I think in a lot of ways I was lucky to

861
01:28:58.72 --> 01:29:04.48
to to to see that model early in my career and I think a lot of times we end up on the path of

862
01:29:04.48 --> 01:29:08.16
of who were following on day one and and they can take you down the wrong road if you got the wrong

863
01:29:08.16 --> 01:29:14.40
people but when you see it in other people and they treat you that way and that feeling of oh this

864
01:29:14.40 --> 01:29:20.000
guy this guy really cares about me this guy really is invested in me being successful in me

865
01:29:20.56 --> 01:29:26.64
having a good good life in a good career it's it's not hard to recognize like oh that that's how

866
01:29:26.64 --> 01:29:31.92
that's what I should do yeah and the exact opposite is true and like when the people and

867
01:29:32.32 --> 01:29:37.04
I work for people that I despised and I despised because that how they treated me how they treated

868
01:29:37.04 --> 01:29:43.20
other people and it's very evident like don't be like that it doesn't work I'll be in a group

869
01:29:43.20 --> 01:29:48.80
of leaders you know we're doing to work with the company I've done this many times where I'll

870
01:29:48.80 --> 01:29:54.56
set it up with hey who here has had someone in your life as that would that that was in charge of

871
01:29:54.56 --> 01:29:58.96
you that invested in you and took care of you raise your hand and everyone raised their hand

872
01:29:59.84 --> 01:30:04.80
and or 99% of the people raise their hand if not 100% of people raise your hand because that's

873
01:30:04.80 --> 01:30:09.28
you know usually we're talking to leaders in the company and so the leaders have made progress somehow

874
01:30:09.84 --> 01:30:14.96
and they've made progress because someone at some point taught them and took them under their wing

875
01:30:14.96 --> 01:30:20.48
and cared about them and yes I say who who's had someone that cared about them invested in them

876
01:30:20.48 --> 01:30:25.28
and took care of them took care of you and so everyone raised their hand and how that feel

877
01:30:25.28 --> 01:30:29.28
and everyone says I had felt awesome what would you do for that leader I do anything for them

878
01:30:29.28 --> 01:30:33.04
why don't you be that leader then why don't you be that leader and take care of those people

879
01:30:33.04 --> 01:30:39.12
properly and you'll end up with a team they'll do anything for you not for selfish reasons

880
01:30:39.12 --> 01:30:44.48
because they'll see right through that you you've got to be doing it for the team when you want

881
01:30:44.48 --> 01:30:51.92
the team to do well then they'll do anything for you yeah I think that's an really important lesson

882
01:30:51.92 --> 01:30:58.56
for any leader out there for for leadership in general is how obvious what you're doing is to other people

883
01:30:59.76 --> 01:31:04.80
and whatever thing you're trying to hide or whatever thing you're trying to cover up or or

884
01:31:04.80 --> 01:31:09.76
or something you're trying to maximize let me see is everybody sees it yeah everybody sees right through it

885
01:31:09.76 --> 01:31:16.32
and you know we ask the same question is okay what would you want your subordinate to do to you come up

886
01:31:16.32 --> 01:31:20.64
and say it's not my fault I didn't have anything and this isn't my fault I couldn't

887
01:31:20.64 --> 01:31:24.80
anything about it you didn't send me up to win or would you like someone to walk them say hey boss

888
01:31:25.20 --> 01:31:28.000
I screwed this up there's a couple things I could have done differently here's what I learned

889
01:31:28.56 --> 01:31:32.64
and you know what I'm gonna do this next time and I'm gonna get this right and I'm gonna fix this

890
01:31:32.64 --> 01:31:35.44
and you say it said those two some really obvious two different scenarios and you ask

891
01:31:35.44 --> 01:31:40.08
you what would you like to have from your subordinates 100% of the people gonna go I want the guy

892
01:31:40.08 --> 01:31:44.32
that comes in and says hey is my fault I'm gonna fix it as a super obvious and then the very next

893
01:31:44.32 --> 01:31:50.48
question is why aren't you doing that with your boss why do you not think that your boss is

894
01:31:50.48 --> 01:31:54.96
having the same feeling as you would have with your subordinates and that recognition of

895
01:31:55.60 --> 01:32:01.84
everybody sees exactly what you're doing that's uncomfortable for people yeah the uncomfortable part

896
01:32:01.84 --> 01:32:08.16
is it's hard for people I guess I guess we think that if you're my boss I think you're not as smart as me

897
01:32:08.16 --> 01:32:12.24
and I think well he's just gonna blame me when I come in and say it's my fault you're gonna go yeah I

898
01:32:12.24 --> 01:32:18.000
know that's why I'm firing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it means like no people are smarter than that

899
01:32:18.56 --> 01:32:23.52
and no one wants to hear excuses no one wants to hear excuses yeah I think you know what sometimes

900
01:32:23.52 --> 01:32:28.56
people screw things up so bad that they're gonna get fired yeah I was just gonna say that like

901
01:32:28.56 --> 01:32:33.12
and guess what if you're going to make excuses guess what you're definitely gonna get fired yeah you're

902
01:32:33.12 --> 01:32:39.04
gonna take whatever limited chance of maybe salvaging that at the last second of like hey boss hang on

903
01:32:39.84 --> 01:32:45.20
let me just if you do you're just guaranteeing the outcome

904
01:32:45.20 --> 01:32:52.48
yeah it talks about that when he was the exo at at a sealed team and he he says you know he

905
01:32:52.48 --> 01:32:55.76
could get a guy that was someone's been wrong and a platoon and a guy would come in and say

906
01:32:55.76 --> 01:33:00.32
you know it's not my fault my chief's no good or my my LPO doesn't know what he's doing

907
01:33:00.32 --> 01:33:03.68
like okay you're fired yeah and then exo comes in and says hey I'm not doing a good job

908
01:33:03.68 --> 01:33:07.84
as well you're here's the things I'm gonna change like okay yeah we'll keep working on it let me

909
01:33:07.84 --> 01:33:11.52
know if you have any questions I mean if I can help you out let's get you the support you need yeah

910
01:33:11.52 --> 01:33:15.52
that's that's a no but that's extreme ownership dot yeah sorry

911
01:33:17.28 --> 01:33:22.40
we would we would have bored sometimes for for pilots you know performance boards and and we would

912
01:33:22.40 --> 01:33:28.48
review a lot of material and a lot of times you you have to fire somebody I mean don't like

913
01:33:28.48 --> 01:33:32.24
doing it but in aviation you use it's a lot of times it's their hold it's the dream we same

914
01:33:32.24 --> 01:33:36.72
thing with the teams like you the dream about this is a kid and you know that you are ending

915
01:33:36.72 --> 01:33:41.68
their life's dream crusher yeah dream crusher you're gonna you're gonna do that and not to mention

916
01:33:42.32 --> 01:33:47.04
paycheck gone yeah well like for officers in the sealed teams a lot of times is it or retirement

917
01:33:47.04 --> 01:33:52.88
or whatever it's it's a bad situation yeah it's it's massive impact it's a huge deal to do that

918
01:33:52.88 --> 01:33:57.76
and you you take that very seriously when you're in a position you're gonna you're gonna be one

919
01:33:57.76 --> 01:34:04.32
of the deciding factors in whether that person stays or goes anytime you get to that point where

920
01:34:04.32 --> 01:34:08.000
you're in mind like hey the best thing is to get rid of this guy and if you bring him in for

921
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:13.76
this are that final interview that final interaction the guarantee way to seal your fate the guarantee

922
01:34:13.76 --> 01:34:17.20
way to ensure what they've already kind of concluded because that's why they're bringing you

923
01:34:17.20 --> 01:34:22.72
in in the first place is to not take any responsibility it's not taking any terms that is 100%

924
01:34:22.72 --> 01:34:27.68
guarantee now it doesn't mean that you might just not be able to you might not have the technical

925
01:34:27.68 --> 01:34:32.08
skills of capability sometimes you're gonna get fired and and sometimes your mistake is so

926
01:34:32.08 --> 01:34:40.80
agriest and does so much damage you gotta go you're gonna get fired but even then the the best thing

927
01:34:40.80 --> 01:34:45.60
you can do the best thing you can do is to take ownership of all that and be like hey boss

928
01:34:46.48 --> 01:34:53.92
I understand I'm sorry or you can go the other route and you can start to throw everybody under the bus

929
01:34:53.92 --> 01:34:59.20
and you know what this is what's interesting there are some people and I've talked many of them

930
01:34:59.20 --> 01:35:07.92
over the years many of them they don't make that connection yeah they literally don't make that

931
01:35:07.92 --> 01:35:14.000
connection they don't make the connection they're looking at their boss and they're saying hey

932
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:19.84
this wasn't my fault it was my whoever it was my subordinate leader it was the maintenance guy

933
01:35:19.84 --> 01:35:26.08
it was this it was that they literally don't make the connection that if you're in charge of

934
01:35:26.08 --> 01:35:31.84
something or the irresponsible something and it goes wrong you're responsible for it yeah and they

935
01:35:31.84 --> 01:35:37.84
cannot make that connection you feel like you're you're just I I would watch when we would have a

936
01:35:37.84 --> 01:35:43.52
bad seal between going through my training and I bring in a a platoon commander or a platoon

937
01:35:43.52 --> 01:35:50.16
chief and they would live like like an assault chief so the guy is in charge of the assault

938
01:35:50.16 --> 01:35:58.08
he's in charge of the assault and it's like hey all your men went to the wrong target

939
01:35:58.08 --> 01:36:06.48
what happened well it was briefed wrong well it was this well we marked the target wasn't

940
01:36:06.48 --> 01:36:11.84
marked correctly the battle maps I mean literally just you come up with 20 excuses and you know

941
01:36:11.84 --> 01:36:16.24
what they're all they'll make sense they're like hey someone made someone put the wrong number on the

942
01:36:16.24 --> 01:36:19.84
brief and and everyone heard the wrong number and they looked at the battle map and they went to that

943
01:36:19.84 --> 01:36:23.92
building okay that's what happened who's fault is it it's not the guy that made the battle map

944
01:36:23.92 --> 01:36:31.36
you're in charge of the assault team you're in charge of the assault team this is this is your fault

945
01:36:32.08 --> 01:36:37.84
and it would I would sometimes I would just actually I would hardly ever say this was your fault

946
01:36:38.56 --> 01:36:44.64
I would milk I would try and milk it out of them I would be like so well I mean but still like

947
01:36:44.64 --> 01:36:48.32
who is in charge of the assault team if only we had a guy in charge of that person they'd say well you

948
01:36:48.32 --> 01:36:52.24
know I mean the easiest is the assault chief you know you can't expect it with the guy to be

949
01:36:52.24 --> 01:36:59.60
confirming that every single guy knows where the target is really okay okay so you're not responsible

950
01:36:59.60 --> 01:37:04.80
for getting the men to the target as you're not responsible for the assault as the assault chief is

951
01:37:04.80 --> 01:37:12.24
what I'm here so it's really horrible when you see that someone can't make the connection

952
01:37:13.28 --> 01:37:18.40
and this is another cool thing like on social media I see this a lot guys will hit me up

953
01:37:18.40 --> 01:37:25.36
girls will hit me up uh something went wrong with a client I stepped in I took ownership they

954
01:37:25.36 --> 01:37:32.40
thanked me problem solved got it squared away I kid people are surprised people are surprised that

955
01:37:32.40 --> 01:37:37.12
it works people are surprised that it works and again just to make sure everybody knows

956
01:37:38.88 --> 01:37:42.88
that that alone doesn't work you still have to solve the problem without you cause with the

957
01:37:42.88 --> 01:37:48.64
client right you you you you gave them what they need late or it's gonna be late and now you say it's my fault

958
01:37:48.64 --> 01:37:52.40
that doesn't mean that you don't need to get it to a ASAP and make up some corrective matters

959
01:37:52.40 --> 01:37:56.08
and low the price to do something so that it makes up for the problem but the worst thing you can

960
01:37:56.08 --> 01:37:59.76
say is well you didn't specify exactly what you wanted in the order and therefore we could get you

961
01:37:59.76 --> 01:38:04.40
what you wanted on time okay we're never coming back for business again and we're angry this whole time

962
01:38:04.40 --> 01:38:09.44
and I'm gonna short you money when we pay you in any ways if I pay you it all yeah let's make it

963
01:38:09.44 --> 01:38:14.64
let's make it the customer and the client's fault let's do that and it gets back to something

964
01:38:14.64 --> 01:38:19.44
you said earlier about the the the conversation about the millennials is just for a minute

965
01:38:19.44 --> 01:38:25.44
detached just take a step back real quick and just put yourself in their position what do they want

966
01:38:25.44 --> 01:38:32.48
to hear what do they want to hear this client that things went sideways that what they needed

967
01:38:32.48 --> 01:38:36.16
from you didn't happen they didn't get it delivered on time it didn't work the way it's supposed

968
01:38:36.16 --> 01:38:40.56
to work or worse you gave it to something and it created a problem for their customers down the line

969
01:38:42.16 --> 01:38:49.60
what do they want to hear from you right now you were to them go and the allergy that should

970
01:38:49.60 --> 01:38:54.32
come from hearing and excuses the allergic reaction hearing someone tell you it's their fault or

971
01:38:54.32 --> 01:38:59.60
or it's not it's not their fault it's somebody else has fault a hundred out of a hundred times

972
01:38:59.60 --> 01:39:06.64
you should understand and the point is it that's still hard to do it's still hard and that bridge is

973
01:39:06.64 --> 01:39:14.40
hard across and reading the book isn't enough it it sets the table would expose you to it but

974
01:39:14.40 --> 01:39:19.76
I think it comes like with everything you you have to get inside it you have to live it but the

975
01:39:19.76 --> 01:39:26.88
thing of it is the first time you do it the first time you do it because it works every single time

976
01:39:26.88 --> 01:39:34.72
when someone once you get to that tipping point once the the domino falls I think it's then it's

977
01:39:34.72 --> 01:39:40.32
like magic then it's just things are just happening on their own and all your people go no no no no this is

978
01:39:40.32 --> 01:39:44.08
this is definitely what we're going to do here we're going to tell them exactly what we did wrong

979
01:39:44.08 --> 01:39:46.88
how are we going to solve the problem what we're going to do to fix it and to make sure it doesn't

980
01:39:46.88 --> 01:39:53.68
happen again and it deescalates the client is like oh man I was really hoping we could fight and argue

981
01:39:53.68 --> 01:39:58.000
and you're not letting me do that now because what you're saying is everything I actually really need to

982
01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:07.12
hear and I'm forced to say okay let's go solve this problem and when you see it from the inside

983
01:40:07.12 --> 01:40:12.08
out of you start to do it that tipping point it happens quick it just takes a lot of time to get there

984
01:40:12.08 --> 01:40:17.20
and there's so much resistance that human nature resistance to oh there there's no way I'm

985
01:40:17.20 --> 01:40:21.20
taking the blame for this I've actually got a bunch of good reasons that I can give you a wise

986
01:40:21.20 --> 01:40:26.56
not really my fault and I'm going to kind of sell like hey boss you know those guys aren't they're

987
01:40:26.56 --> 01:40:30.56
not they're not the best guys you know this is not the best team here's here's a here's a

988
01:40:30.56 --> 01:40:37.60
say let's call it a drill or a coaching I'll call it that a coaching when the next time you get into

989
01:40:37.60 --> 01:40:44.64
a situation and you write down and you take the excuses and the reasons that you come up with

990
01:40:44.64 --> 01:40:50.96
look at them and then figure out how they were how those things were actually your fault

991
01:40:50.96 --> 01:40:55.04
and or how you could have prevented them because a lot of times it's like here's here's here's one

992
01:40:56.16 --> 01:41:02.72
hey boss we didn't get the mission accomplished because the weather rolled in and we couldn't launch

993
01:41:02.72 --> 01:41:09.92
on the mission that's that's the problem now we all know that we don't control the weather so

994
01:41:09.92 --> 01:41:13.36
when you we'll tell you write the problem down we failed the mission because we didn't control the

995
01:41:13.36 --> 01:41:17.36
weather we we can't control the weather that's why we failed the mission that's my excuse that's

996
01:41:17.36 --> 01:41:24.24
a that's a logical reason there's that's that's a that's a legitimate excuse but don't use it

997
01:41:25.12 --> 01:41:30.96
what you do is you say what could I have done to have controlled the weather okay I don't okay

998
01:41:30.96 --> 01:41:36.40
okay wait I can't control the weather what could I have done I could have come up with a contingency plan

999
01:41:36.40 --> 01:41:41.60
I could have come up we could have staged in a better place so then you go to the boss and you

1000
01:41:41.60 --> 01:41:50.16
say look boss here's what happened the weather went south really bad that was a problem but it's

1001
01:41:50.16 --> 01:41:54.56
a problem that I should have done a better job taking care of what I should have done was I should

1002
01:41:54.56 --> 01:41:59.52
had a contingency plan I should have staged closer to the target area that I could have taken

1003
01:41:59.52 --> 01:42:06.40
vehicles and set a helicopter's that's my fault from now on I will absolutely have a secondary plan

1004
01:42:06.40 --> 01:42:11.52
this won't happen again we can't control the weather but we can control how we plan and how we

1005
01:42:11.52 --> 01:42:16.80
execute and this won't happen again there you go so you take the most outrageous thing that you

1006
01:42:16.80 --> 01:42:22.24
know you can't control you figure out a way to control it and you take ownership of that thing

1007
01:42:22.88 --> 01:42:28.88
and it's gonna it's gonna make your life so much better and by the way the next time you have a mission

1008
01:42:28.88 --> 01:42:33.28
and you plan that contingency and you actually execute and implement what you said you're going to

1009
01:42:33.28 --> 01:42:39.44
do guess what you will accomplish the mission that there's a whole part of ownership that pre-empts

1010
01:42:39.44 --> 01:42:44.48
the problem if you've got someone that knows if I know that I can make an excuse if I know that

1011
01:42:44.48 --> 01:42:49.36
I can make an excuse think that's what I'm not gonna set things up properly if I don't set things up properly

1012
01:42:50.32 --> 01:42:56.08
more often or more often than the other way I will fail to execute what I'm supposed to execute

1013
01:42:56.08 --> 01:42:59.84
if you have an excuse right same same thing with you as an individual human being

1014
01:43:00.72 --> 01:43:07.60
if you as an individual human being if you got some excuses that you can throw out there

1015
01:43:07.60 --> 01:43:13.52
that you can say I had no control over that then you know what you say okay what are my contingency

1016
01:43:13.52 --> 01:43:17.76
plans what could I have planned differently let's eliminate those excuses take ownership of your

1017
01:43:17.76 --> 01:43:24.40
freaking life yeah and in that situation too when you're you're talking about this this

1018
01:43:24.40 --> 01:43:30.48
example of the weather and if you as a leader actually accept the excuse like hey boss that's

1019
01:43:30.48 --> 01:43:35.04
told me old-an and just crush this and you're like yeah yeah out of your control there's no

1020
01:43:35.04 --> 01:43:40.40
way to solve for this problem it's unsolved what if you just guarantee it will happen every single time

1021
01:43:40.40 --> 01:43:45.52
the weather rolls in you set that in stone it will never be different the weather will crush you

1022
01:43:45.52 --> 01:43:50.72
every single time or you could go I don't know look at your weather app and go we got to go

1023
01:43:50.72 --> 01:43:57.60
six hours early in stage and we're gonna walk in and it works both ways and if you accept those

1024
01:43:57.60 --> 01:44:02.40
excuses you're now getting like that's a free pass for ear or not the weather is actually something

1025
01:44:02.40 --> 01:44:09.84
we can't control so that was now something that is okay why we fail yeah it's I understand that

1026
01:44:09.84 --> 01:44:13.52
it's hard I know that feeling and then but when you see it get to the other side and you see people

1027
01:44:13.52 --> 01:44:20.24
doing like that that was sort of like a turning point for me mentally because as I as I grew up and

1028
01:44:20.24 --> 01:44:28.08
I said to myself you know well I understood that I needed to take responsibility for what was happening

1029
01:44:28.08 --> 01:44:36.08
but the turning point for me came when I realized that no matter what happened if I'm the guy in

1030
01:44:36.08 --> 01:44:42.16
charge if I'm the guy in charge we need to get this thing done that's the way it is and when you

1031
01:44:42.16 --> 01:44:46.96
when you have that thought in your brain the preparation you do is so much more solid because there's

1032
01:44:46.96 --> 01:44:56.56
no way out yeah there's no way out so you got to execute when when leaders see the world like that

1033
01:44:56.56 --> 01:45:03.12
when they see it that way they just work until the problem gets solved they just do everything they

1034
01:45:03.12 --> 01:45:09.52
need to do until they find a way to fix the problem to solve it and when they don't think like that

1035
01:45:09.52 --> 01:45:13.84
they they're they're outlets they're off ramps of like ah can't do it can't do it can't do it

1036
01:45:13.84 --> 01:45:18.72
can't do it and we used to we call that the excuse matrix that's the word you're like oh

1037
01:45:18.72 --> 01:45:23.60
come to the excuse matrix yeah and and and then the other part of this you got to remember is this

1038
01:45:23.60 --> 01:45:30.16
doesn't mean this doesn't mean that I'm gonna bang my head up against the wall 47 times

1039
01:45:30.16 --> 01:45:37.28
yeah to accomplish the mission that just like oh guess what part of this is hey I didn't plan it well

1040
01:45:37.92 --> 01:45:44.16
I made some mistakes I didn't calculate correctly and now we are not gonna get this done

1041
01:45:45.44 --> 01:45:50.48
and that's the way it is and so I'm not saying you continue to beat your head against the wall

1042
01:45:50.48 --> 01:45:57.12
47 47 is the limit don't do 48 when you've done 48 you've gone too far you're not gonna get

1043
01:45:57.12 --> 01:46:01.68
through the wall yeah trust me if you can get through a wall they'll get through by the 47 head but

1044
01:46:02.24 --> 01:46:06.64
after that it's not happening so you gotta take a little you gotta look for the alternate row

1045
01:46:06.64 --> 01:46:12.40
yeah so there's a difference there's a difference between we're gonna get this done no matter what

1046
01:46:12.40 --> 01:46:18.96
and we're gonna get this done no matter what you sometimes you got to back off

1047
01:46:18.96 --> 01:46:23.44
yeah sometimes you gotta reattach that's the way it is yeah sometimes you gotta reassess

1048
01:46:23.44 --> 01:46:28.32
your plan and somebody got to get you got to go a different direction and when it all costs

1049
01:46:28.32 --> 01:46:32.72
doesn't mean I'm gonna charge that elevated machine gun deaths through open ground

1050
01:46:33.60 --> 01:46:38.64
wave after wave after wave it means you're gonna do something else it doesn't mean you're gonna

1051
01:46:38.64 --> 01:46:43.68
abandon the attack on that position but you might actually do it a different way and it may be like

1052
01:46:43.68 --> 01:46:49.84
my plan sucked here's all the things that I learned about my stupid plan anybody got else

1053
01:46:49.84 --> 01:46:52.80
it may back get some help hey that's what I've seen this before this what we did that's a good

1054
01:46:52.80 --> 01:46:59.20
idea let's do that plan and you know we again we could talk about this for a long time but I think

1055
01:46:59.20 --> 01:47:07.52
that that natural tendency to be exposed as as someone who doesn't know something to be exposed

1056
01:47:07.52 --> 01:47:11.60
as someone who doesn't have all the answers to expose as a leader who doesn't know everything

1057
01:47:11.60 --> 01:47:19.84
I'm gonna let you in a little secret everybody already knows that everybody knows that you

1058
01:47:19.84 --> 01:47:25.20
don't know everything and if you try to act like you do it will make it ten times worse than just

1059
01:47:25.20 --> 01:47:30.24
saying I actually don't know what to do here or I made a mistake here when you make a mistake

1060
01:47:31.20 --> 01:47:35.68
everybody knows it your subordinates know it your peers know it your boss is know it

1061
01:47:35.68 --> 01:47:42.000
and the worst thing you can do is to tell them that you didn't that's why being insecure in

1062
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.32
your leadership capabilities is a downward spiral because the more insecure you are the more you

1063
01:47:48.32 --> 01:47:53.36
try and manipulate the main thing everything and keep everything under your wraps and do everything

1064
01:47:53.36 --> 01:47:58.80
your way and that's how it is so when you're insecure as a leader and that's another that's

1065
01:47:58.80 --> 01:48:03.60
another thing that takes a little bit of a leap of faith that's another like progression that I

1066
01:48:03.60 --> 01:48:09.44
personally made I personally made and I can't remember when but when I was like you know what

1067
01:48:10.32 --> 01:48:20.16
it's okay it's okay I'm not gonna be I'm not the best in the world and everybody knows that

1068
01:48:20.16 --> 01:48:26.08
and the more I try to act like that the more obvious that's gonna be and the minute you say that

1069
01:48:26.08 --> 01:48:33.20
the minute you recognize that people are going hmm okay he might not be the best but at least he

1070
01:48:33.20 --> 01:48:38.08
knows that as opposed to he's not the best and he thinks he is that's a nightmare yeah I want

1071
01:48:38.08 --> 01:48:44.24
to work for that guy and the the best part about what you just said is that that's something we all

1072
01:48:44.24 --> 01:48:48.64
had to learn that's something we all had to figure out at some point in our life none of us were born

1073
01:48:48.64 --> 01:48:54.80
like oh no I knew all this at birth it's from these giant errors that we've made or giant mistakes

1074
01:48:54.80 --> 01:49:00.96
where these giant realizations like I've been doing it wrong and everybody has to figure that out

1075
01:49:00.96 --> 01:49:06.000
and that and that right there that is one of the most gratifying things about what we do now

1076
01:49:06.88 --> 01:49:13.04
is that this gap that we talked about earlier this little gap between like how do you read something

1077
01:49:13.92 --> 01:49:20.40
you read something and then how do you get that thing out of it how do you extract that

1078
01:49:20.40 --> 01:49:25.12
vital piece of information that's in there how do you do that how do you tell look it looks like

1079
01:49:25.12 --> 01:49:29.12
when you're kidding you don't listen to your parents right you just how do you get that he close

1080
01:49:29.12 --> 01:49:35.28
that gap and what's awesome about what we do now is that we get to close that gap with people we get

1081
01:49:35.28 --> 01:49:41.44
I mean I see it on a daily basis on a daily basis with the leaders that we work with you get to see

1082
01:49:41.44 --> 01:49:46.88
their eyes open up and you go boom they get it now everything we just talked about which you know

1083
01:49:46.88 --> 01:49:53.60
which we had to learn over time and extrapolate from our experiences and then on top of that go through

1084
01:49:53.60 --> 01:50:01.20
horrible situations where we fail as leaders and we've figured out a way to say look here it is

1085
01:50:01.20 --> 01:50:07.84
here's how it works and to see people's eyes open up and then to see the performance that's the best

1086
01:50:07.84 --> 01:50:15.04
to see the performance go through the roof as the leader and then of course when the leader

1087
01:50:15.04 --> 01:50:18.80
starts doing well then the leaders start doing well and when all the leaders start doing well

1088
01:50:18.80 --> 01:50:26.88
guess what now we have a winning team yeah two emphasize what you said that eyes opening that's a

1089
01:50:26.88 --> 01:50:33.60
literal thing like they're not of metaphor you look at them and when you finally get it to click

1090
01:50:33.60 --> 01:50:40.08
when you when their eyes actually open up and they sit up straight and they kind of sit back a little bit

1091
01:50:40.08 --> 01:50:48.16
and there is a moment a physical moment are you recognize that they got it and when you see that

1092
01:50:48.16 --> 01:50:52.000
and you can actually sit in an audience when you when you when you're talking to a group like

1093
01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.36
maybe multiple leaders on the team and you're around a conference table and you're interacting and you

1094
01:50:55.36 --> 01:50:59.52
bring up a particular example that they're dealing with you lay out the different possible scenarios

1095
01:50:59.52 --> 01:51:06.08
and the one that is obviously the right one and they go oh my god when they get that that feeling

1096
01:51:06.08 --> 01:51:11.52
is unbelievable and it's the best part about this is when they get it but you literally see that

1097
01:51:11.52 --> 01:51:16.56
happen and that is awesome and that's that for me so when my last three years when I was in the

1098
01:51:16.56 --> 01:51:21.60
team's not working run in the training for the West Coast heel teams and I got to see that I got

1099
01:51:21.60 --> 01:51:26.72
to see that with these young leaders and just I'm it's it's in my head right I got to tell

1100
01:51:26.72 --> 01:51:31.12
the story there's a young kid who I know who's an awesome guy and I didn't really know him

1101
01:51:31.12 --> 01:51:34.72
that well this time but he was kind of like a pipe hitter in a platoon and there's totally

1102
01:51:34.72 --> 01:51:39.36
me I'm going on total chaos going on and I just like go over to him and like his you know his

1103
01:51:39.36 --> 01:51:44.96
platoon commander was simulated dead and blah blah blah blah blah and the platoon chief was simulated

1104
01:51:44.96 --> 01:51:48.72
and the LPO wasn't making a call and it's total chaos man when I walk over to him and I'm like

1105
01:51:48.72 --> 01:51:55.68
hey man and he's like yeah and and I go hey man bro are you going to do something about this right

1106
01:51:55.68 --> 01:52:01.60
here and and that was all he needed to hear all he needed to hear was like that guy that was in

1107
01:52:01.60 --> 01:52:06.32
charge at all this training was telling me like was asking me a question he was questioning me

1108
01:52:06.32 --> 01:52:11.84
and saying are you going to do something about this his eyes opened up and he said oh hell yes

1109
01:52:11.84 --> 01:52:17.76
I am and boom he starts stepped up started making calls and the whole the whole paradigm in the

1110
01:52:17.76 --> 01:52:23.60
situation completely changed because he's he stepped up and let and so I got to see that then

1111
01:52:23.60 --> 01:52:29.84
and I get to see it now so that's a cool thing yeah it is and the stories about my experience

1112
01:52:29.84 --> 01:52:36.16
at top going to are are identical and when when you go out of missions and they suck and you get

1113
01:52:36.16 --> 01:52:45.20
savage and it's just terrible guys come back and and they're miserable losing sucks man it sucks

1114
01:52:45.20 --> 01:52:49.52
when you have this huge plenty of out there and you get savage it sucks and then when you go

1115
01:52:49.52 --> 01:52:53.92
through this whole thing and there's that recognition and they change away they breathe they change

1116
01:52:53.92 --> 01:52:57.12
away they train they change away they do things with their guys and they go out and they come back

1117
01:52:57.12 --> 01:53:01.84
and when you dominate that feeling of coming back from a flight and you just dominated

1118
01:53:01.84 --> 01:53:07.84
that's a really good feeling and so when when they do this and they start winning like you

1119
01:53:07.84 --> 01:53:12.72
just described you got that team then they start winning then then then then they are then

1120
01:53:12.72 --> 01:53:16.32
they are thorough but as they're running on and then you get as a leader get to back off and like

1121
01:53:16.32 --> 01:53:21.52
and just get to watch them go dominate that feeling of being successful when you implement these

1122
01:53:21.52 --> 01:53:27.76
things as a leader that's the best feeling in the world and when you see that from your

1123
01:53:27.76 --> 01:53:33.60
your junior sports from your subornus from your team and you see them go do that there is nothing

1124
01:53:33.60 --> 01:53:38.80
better than that and then you get to say well we get to see I used to see this the opening you

1125
01:53:38.80 --> 01:53:43.92
get to see it start to take all the yeah and but Echo you've talked about this where I'm like

1126
01:53:44.56 --> 01:53:51.12
where you you know what I'm doing like with you you know what I'm doing you sat here through

1127
01:53:51.12 --> 01:53:56.80
hundreds of hours of me talking about how I'm going to treat someone on my team

1128
01:53:56.80 --> 01:54:05.92
and you're like you know what I'm doing and it's still worth 100% and what cool is when you know

1129
01:54:05.92 --> 01:54:11.12
what the person's doing when you know what your your leaders doing and it still works then you go

1130
01:54:11.12 --> 01:54:14.40
you know what I'm going to do it too and that's how it spreads throughout these words out of the

1131
01:54:14.40 --> 01:54:20.000
spreads yeah because okay so let's say I don't know I make a mistake or something like that and

1132
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:26.24
you say hey it's you know I should have done this little better right so it's like obvious like

1133
01:54:26.24 --> 01:54:30.56
that's that's that has never been your job not you know since whatever whatever that may be right

1134
01:54:31.28 --> 01:54:36.16
so obviously I'm like like I know what you're doing your bigger than your true ownership you know just so

1135
01:54:36.16 --> 01:54:44.48
we can get the problems up I get it but to me what I felt was not what you're doing but what you're

1136
01:54:44.48 --> 01:54:49.60
not doing you're not telling me hey what's up with this you know hey why did you make that you're not

1137
01:54:50.16 --> 01:54:55.52
you're not attacking me so so I have to be defensive you know you're not doing that so it's not

1138
01:54:55.52 --> 01:55:01.52
defensive I say what you're doing the whole thing but okay whatever whatever you're like okay

1139
01:55:01.52 --> 01:55:05.36
all right and you wish you want to do is get it done whatever the thing is we all want to get it done

1140
01:55:05.36 --> 01:55:09.44
that's the thing we all want to you know even like with your wife that's that's a huge one so

1141
01:55:09.44 --> 01:55:14.16
then you guys always talking in context of business you know the boss and the support and that's

1142
01:55:14.16 --> 01:55:19.60
whatever same exact thing with your wife same thing even though it feels like counter intuitive you know

1143
01:55:19.60 --> 01:55:25.20
you're you you had all this stuff to do that you're doing for her by the way and you didn't take

1144
01:55:25.20 --> 01:55:28.80
out the trash I don't know I'm not saying that happened to me not saying it didn't happen to me

1145
01:55:30.16 --> 01:55:34.40
but you didn't take out the trash meanwhile you did literally from the moment you woke up to to that

1146
01:55:34.40 --> 01:55:40.80
moment you got you know accused of whatever you did stuff for her right you couldn't

1147
01:55:40.80 --> 01:55:49.12
done that hypothetically you hurt her saying hey you know you you didn't take out the trash all those

1148
01:55:49.12 --> 01:55:55.60
feelings in your mind in your heart is to it's not to be like you're right I should have done that it's

1149
01:55:55.60 --> 01:56:00.88
not to say that it's the same the opposite yeah that's like I did all this other stuff for you so

1150
01:56:00.88 --> 01:56:10.72
you're doing it overwhelming like I will not and cannot bring myself to say you're right you're

1151
01:56:10.72 --> 01:56:16.40
right about that but if you can manage to do that you'd be baffled how easy how good it works

1152
01:56:17.68 --> 01:56:23.20
it works yeah but yeah it's it's what you're not doing I think like if you know like I see what you're

1153
01:56:23.20 --> 01:56:27.76
doing I see you're doing there using your little chocolate tricks all this stuff that's not the

1154
01:56:27.76 --> 01:56:34.08
influential part you're not doing you know it's so funny now because everyone I deal with now

1155
01:56:34.80 --> 01:56:43.04
every single person that I deal with on any level on any on any depth at all they all know

1156
01:56:43.76 --> 01:56:48.96
all my little tricks as you call them they all know every every person I'm involved with knows them

1157
01:56:48.96 --> 01:56:56.80
all yeah and it's like yeah cool I'll go even one further with this guy he'll go he'll it's almost

1158
01:56:56.80 --> 01:57:01.84
like he'll double do it to the point where it's a joke insulting you and you think it's funny

1159
01:57:03.20 --> 01:57:07.28
yet you're still not different so he'll be like I don't know whatever let's say I didn't press

1160
01:57:07.28 --> 01:57:12.48
record and the thing forgot we'll just say never done that before maybe not have ever done that before

1161
01:57:13.20 --> 01:57:17.92
but he'll be like hey you're right you know I should I should double and triple check that thing you

1162
01:57:17.92 --> 01:57:21.52
know I mean it's wherever there but I still totally could it you know so obvious he's throwing

1163
01:57:21.52 --> 01:57:25.60
anything in your face you know that it's not his fault but he's like going through the motions almost

1164
01:57:25.60 --> 01:57:30.56
like like kind of kind of understanding you know but it's so funny because that's the rule kind of

1165
01:57:30.56 --> 01:57:35.84
thing so it's like he's he's blaming you but he's not really officially blaming you and it's just

1166
01:57:35.84 --> 01:57:41.60
but it still works that's the thing you know so because it's all just one day yeah meanwhile

1167
01:57:41.60 --> 01:57:45.76
yeah the whole recording is trash by the way because it didn't even happen but yeah you're not

1168
01:57:45.76 --> 01:57:51.12
defensive because it's just you know it's like well I don't I don't say this the reason why it works

1169
01:57:51.12 --> 01:57:56.56
code unquote the reason it works is in a reason it works with the people that I deal with in my

1170
01:57:56.56 --> 01:58:02.000
life for my family to by business partners across the board the reason that it works is because

1171
01:58:02.64 --> 01:58:08.08
I'm not doing it for me that that's the big difference so if you're out there and you're thinking

1172
01:58:08.08 --> 01:58:13.04
oh cool I'm gonna learn these tactics so I can I can get further in my life and I can get things

1173
01:58:13.04 --> 01:58:18.80
out of the world to take no it's it's not gonna work out well for you yeah on the surface because

1174
01:58:18.80 --> 01:58:24.72
I'm gonna tell you what you gotta take that one step further because guess what if this is the

1175
01:58:24.72 --> 01:58:29.60
this is the amazing thing if what you're doing is you're focused on taking care of the team

1176
01:58:29.60 --> 01:58:34.96
taking care of your people doing the right thing for the right reasons and you're and you think to

1177
01:58:34.96 --> 01:58:39.04
yourself so if you're listening to this right now going well I really want to I really want to get ahead

1178
01:58:39.04 --> 01:58:49.20
and jocco just said I'm not gonna get ahead if I if I put myself to get ahead then it's not

1179
01:58:49.20 --> 01:58:55.20
gonna work so this isn't for me here's the here's the dichotomy in this thing and it's a huge

1180
01:58:55.20 --> 01:59:00.88
dichotomy if you're there and you're in a leadership position or you're just in a position

1181
01:59:00.88 --> 01:59:06.48
you're in a relationship whatever and you're doing things for the team you're trying to take care

1182
01:59:06.48 --> 01:59:15.60
of the others you're putting other people above you in the end you're going to win and you're

1183
01:59:15.60 --> 01:59:22.32
gonna win way bigger than you could if you were clawing and scratching and ripping things and

1184
01:59:22.32 --> 01:59:28.64
bringing them back to yourself the end that person that thinks that thinks that they're doing the

1185
01:59:28.64 --> 01:59:32.16
right thing or things that they're doing something good for themselves but what they're really

1186
01:59:32.16 --> 01:59:36.64
doing is taking things from other people that person they might get a couple of tactical victories

1187
01:59:36.64 --> 01:59:43.28
along the way but in the end the person that puts everyone else first is going to win they are

1188
01:59:43.28 --> 01:59:49.68
going to win so it's it's kind of hypocritical because it's like in one hand it's like no I don't

1189
01:59:49.68 --> 01:59:55.04
care about myself I'm not trying to improve I'm not trying to try to improve my station in life

1190
01:59:55.44 --> 02:00:00.16
but by doing that you will improve your station in life and you will improve your station in life

1191
02:00:00.16 --> 02:00:05.84
beyond anything that you could have done if your goal was to improve your station in life

1192
02:00:09.36 --> 02:00:10.80
that's good stuff right there

1193
02:00:10.80 --> 02:00:16.48
yes it is take note of that one yeah any other major topics that you want to bring up tonight

1194
02:00:19.92 --> 02:00:28.32
it works especially with your wife not also with your wife but especially with your wife

1195
02:00:28.32 --> 02:00:34.80
yeah and so it should just be habit that anytime she says you didn't do this it actually

1196
02:00:34.80 --> 02:00:41.12
she's right you didn't and just be like you're right I didn't I have learned that lesson

1197
02:00:41.12 --> 02:00:46.64
yeah a few times yeah and again this is going to sound obvious but it's one of those things you

1198
02:00:46.64 --> 02:00:51.36
got a kind of consciously remember especially if you're with your wife with someone you're with

1199
02:00:51.36 --> 02:00:56.32
every day or really really often the part yeah you take a you take ownership you take this

1200
02:00:56.32 --> 02:01:00.80
responsibility but then you actually do have to actually solve the problem because if you're like hey

1201
02:01:00.80 --> 02:01:05.76
you're right in take out that trash you know I mean you know it won't happen again and then tomorrow

1202
02:01:05.76 --> 02:01:09.76
same thing to my same thing next week same things same things you then you just sort of become

1203
02:01:09.76 --> 02:01:13.92
the husband that doesn't take out the trash and it just says yeah it's my fault kind of thing

1204
02:01:13.92 --> 02:01:18.40
and you you've become the and that's my bad yeah my bad my bad my bad my bad start about that

1205
02:01:18.96 --> 02:01:26.000
and then that's all you do is say that it's on me yeah and in the c.s so don't let me know

1206
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.56
one of you trick take out the trash once in a while yeah kind of you know obviously don't say that

1207
02:01:31.76 --> 02:01:37.04
but you actually do have to take out the trash it out problems get solved see I learned that

1208
02:01:37.04 --> 02:01:45.36
I'm juggle alright that's a good one and Dave obviously thank you for coming on again

1209
02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:52.40
thanks for your service in the Marine Corps and for everything you done for America

1210
02:01:52.40 --> 02:01:58.16
it's always an honor to have known you to have work with you and it's an honor to be

1211
02:01:58.16 --> 02:02:04.48
working with you right now and I actually want to close out this conversation with another letter

1212
02:02:06.08 --> 02:02:16.24
and it's also written by that same that same young articulate even poetic Marine Corps

1213
02:02:16.24 --> 02:02:23.84
machine gunner Saul sigal who wrote the letter that opened this podcast and this

1214
02:02:23.84 --> 02:02:32.08
one is written to the cousin of one of his comrades one of his comrades named James Trobridge

1215
02:02:34.24 --> 02:02:42.40
and the cousin did not know what happened to her cousin Corp. Trobridge who had gone missing

1216
02:02:42.40 --> 02:02:50.16
in a world war one and she had known what happened to him and so this is another letter written

1217
02:02:50.16 --> 02:03:02.000
after the end of the war it's dated February 18th 1920 and it reads my dear mistro bridge

1218
02:03:03.36 --> 02:03:08.32
my old sergeant major Clifford has written me and as enclosed a copy of your letter to him

1219
02:03:08.32 --> 02:03:13.36
in which you request information concerning your cousin Corp. James H. Trobridge

1220
02:03:14.80 --> 02:03:21.36
it is indeed unfortunate that his family should be left so uncertain concerning his

1221
02:03:21.36 --> 02:03:28.88
sad end I know that it has been the cause of great concern with you I am sorry to that I had not

1222
02:03:28.88 --> 02:03:33.12
known of this before for I was the last of his friends to see him alive

1223
02:03:33.12 --> 02:03:41.20
those sergeant Clifford wrote me January 16th I have been out adventuring in the oil fields

1224
02:03:41.20 --> 02:03:48.40
of northern Texas and I have only lately ventured back into civilization. Your letter was

1225
02:03:48.40 --> 02:03:55.20
forwarded to me from my home in Ohio and I received it tonight and I'm taking this first occasion

1226
02:03:55.20 --> 02:04:00.40
to answer it I hope it will clear up Jim's case and if there's anything I can do in the future

1227
02:04:00.40 --> 02:04:07.44
any service I can perform any advice I can offer to Jim's folks I will be at their service at all times

1228
02:04:10.72 --> 02:04:17.52
we who have survived this hell on earth count it the least we can do to console the

1229
02:04:17.52 --> 02:04:21.92
sowing mothers and families of our dead comrades in arms.

1230
02:04:21.92 --> 02:04:32.56
I still remember when I first met Jim it was in Bella Woods on the 13th of June we were

1231
02:04:32.56 --> 02:04:38.80
making ready for the attack when replacements arrived to fill up our broken ranks. Jim was assigned

1232
02:04:38.80 --> 02:04:45.20
to my gun crew and the way he went over the top like the brave soldier he always was and his

1233
02:04:45.20 --> 02:04:52.56
subsequent actions made me his proud friend in comrade to the day he went west.

1234
02:04:55.44 --> 02:05:02.64
I still remember one night on guard with Jim in the little hole alongside the night held

1235
02:05:02.64 --> 02:05:12.000
and eerie stillness a night fit for such a hell hole. I was defy tired and though there was no

1236
02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:20.40
wire only an empty space between the Germans and us I slept and Jim like the good pal he was

1237
02:05:20.40 --> 02:05:25.28
kept watching till the officer of the watch came by when he awakened me that I might not be shot

1238
02:05:25.28 --> 02:05:33.04
for sleeping at my post. It was for deeds like that that every man in the company idolized him

1239
02:05:35.04 --> 02:05:41.76
and I can assure you that Jim trobbridge name and memory will forever be held in reverence

1240
02:05:41.76 --> 02:05:51.92
by the survivors of the 23rd company. So many men were wounded and left us then came back during

1241
02:05:51.92 --> 02:05:57.92
the battles that followed Bella Woods to the last phase of the Argonne Drive that I must confess

1242
02:05:57.92 --> 02:06:04.16
ignorance as to whether Jim was or not. You see Jim was assigned to a crew of his own

1243
02:06:04.16 --> 02:06:11.28
and a machine gun of his own and on the battle line the number one and number ten gun maybe

1244
02:06:11.28 --> 02:06:20.24
in the same company yet they are a world apart. Each carries on and knows that the other is

1245
02:06:20.24 --> 02:06:30.000
carrying on and so the battle is won. Yet I dimly remember that Jim was either gasped or wounded

1246
02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:35.84
in the champagne drive in which the second division captured Mont Blanc Ridge.

1247
02:06:38.32 --> 02:06:45.84
It began on October 2nd 1918. Jim came back to us before the last phase the Argonne Drive

1248
02:06:45.84 --> 02:06:53.60
which began on November 1st 1918 through the mud and rain and fog we pushed forward over the top

1249
02:06:53.60 --> 02:07:02.000
that glorious day the second division leading the whole army. We captured every piece of

1250
02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:08.88
both field artillery white hot they were and we sent the German scurrying back and broke their

1251
02:07:08.88 --> 02:07:17.92
invincible line to bits. My company suffered terribly in dead and wounded.

1252
02:07:17.92 --> 02:07:25.60
Yet we carried on hungry and tired and facing the everlasting hail of bullets and shells.

1253
02:07:27.60 --> 02:07:35.52
We pushed forward for six days battling steadily. The 6th of November rose dismaly.

1254
02:07:36.88 --> 02:07:41.68
I remember passing Jim by the roadside and he gave me a cheery hail.

1255
02:07:41.68 --> 02:07:48.16
Then he followed up the rear we went forward and the boat began shelling us.

1256
02:07:49.12 --> 02:07:55.52
As the last of the column came up I heard from them that Jim's crew had rested once again

1257
02:07:55.52 --> 02:07:59.76
by the roadside. None of us were strong. We had not eaten in days.

1258
02:08:02.40 --> 02:08:09.36
A great shell had exploded and it killed and wounded all of Jim's crew. Jim had had a foot torn

1259
02:08:09.36 --> 02:08:18.88
off by a flying fragment. There was death and destruction all about. I volunteered to help

1260
02:08:18.88 --> 02:08:27.28
carry a wounded man back to the first aid station. There was Jim lying on the blanketed floor.

1261
02:08:29.76 --> 02:08:36.24
I knelt down to speak to him. I marked that his face was already drawn with pain

1262
02:08:36.24 --> 02:08:45.12
and that he was gray from long exposure and loss of blood. He said,

1263
02:08:45.12 --> 02:08:59.68
Saul, old pal, I'm dying. Good luck to you old man. I tried to cheer him up but to no avail. On the

1264
02:08:59.68 --> 02:09:11.28
battlefield one knows when death approaches. That is all I know. For a few hours later I was knocked

1265
02:09:11.28 --> 02:09:20.96
out myself. Yet I doubt not that Jim went west to home and to mother soon after.

1266
02:09:23.04 --> 02:09:28.56
Weather Jim died and was buried in the village a few miles south of C. Dan in the

1267
02:09:28.56 --> 02:09:33.44
Arden's department or whether he survived until he reached the hospital. I do not know.

1268
02:09:33.44 --> 02:09:42.80
You can find out by running the graves registration bureau at Washington. That he has gone

1269
02:09:44.32 --> 02:09:51.76
I am reasonably sure. I would advise his family to harbor no unfounded hopes in his safety.

1270
02:09:51.76 --> 02:10:04.000
It is with deeper grit that I ask yours and Jim's mother's pardon for my heartless and

1271
02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:09.68
brutal description of this story. My experiences on the battlefield have caused me to use other

1272
02:10:09.68 --> 02:10:20.24
than tender words that might sue the broken hearted mother. Believe me, nevertheless, that I

1273
02:10:20.24 --> 02:10:30.32
grieve with her for her son and my comrade and believe me too that I stand ready to do all in my

1274
02:10:30.32 --> 02:10:45.36
power to assist her in any possible way. It is hard. I know yet at such a cost has liberty and democracy

1275
02:10:45.36 --> 02:10:57.76
survived except my dear mistrode bridge the assurance of my profound respect.

1276
02:10:57.76 --> 02:11:19.44
Most sincerely. Sol Sequel. So liberty and democracy survived.

1277
02:11:19.44 --> 02:11:36.000
But at such a cost and so many bore that cost, the fighting that Sol Sequel writes about

1278
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:44.48
was part of the Muse Argon offensive. There's part of the hundred days offensive

1279
02:11:44.48 --> 02:11:55.44
that brought the war to an end. And while bringing the war to the end, it cost the lives of

1280
02:11:55.44 --> 02:12:09.04
26,277 Americans. Corporal James Trobridge was one of those Americans. He died around the 6th of November

1281
02:12:09.04 --> 02:12:24.80
1918. And as we know, the armistice was signed and the war ended just five days later.

1282
02:12:24.80 --> 02:12:48.16
On November 11th 1918. War is held in the cost of liberty. In the cost of the democracy is immense.

1283
02:12:48.16 --> 02:12:58.16
And I started this podcast. We were talking about that quote. The quote that says,

1284
02:12:58.16 --> 02:13:12.000
when you know the way broadly, you see it and everything. Well, in that vein, I think that if you know

1285
02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:22.56
the cost broadly, if you know the cost of freedom, then you see it and you appreciate it in everything.

1286
02:13:25.36 --> 02:13:37.60
In everything that we have been given, especially our most precious gift.

1287
02:13:37.60 --> 02:14:00.32
And that is freedom. And I think that's all I've got for tonight.

1288
02:14:00.32 --> 02:14:12.88
And I think at this point, echo if you want to maybe give us an opportunity to decompress

1289
02:14:12.88 --> 02:14:26.000
or maybe we could help you talk about how we can take advantage of the freedom that we have.

1290
02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:35.44
Yes, sir. Cool. We'll do both. And support yourself too, by the way.

1291
02:14:37.44 --> 02:14:41.76
So first, we'll talk about origin. I know a little bit of rough transition because

1292
02:14:43.52 --> 02:14:48.08
that's how it's because that's a letter right there. Yeah, again,

1293
02:14:48.08 --> 02:14:56.32
what now he's so now he's 22, says 19, 20, 22 years old Dave. Yeah, unreal.

1294
02:14:57.44 --> 02:15:02.96
Yeah, I tried to figure out what happened to him. Like what where where he went,

1295
02:15:02.96 --> 02:15:06.64
did he take over like a big company? He must have done something awesome.

1296
02:15:07.44 --> 02:15:12.48
Saul, Cigal. Cigal. Yeah, it's S-E-G-E-L.

1297
02:15:12.48 --> 02:15:17.84
Cigal, Cigal. Cigal. Cigal. Cigal. She should have become a writer. They should have, I'm absolutely become a writer.

1298
02:15:17.84 --> 02:15:26.08
Maybe he was. Yeah, you read these letters. And again, you say it's all time, but you kind of can't help,

1299
02:15:26.08 --> 02:15:33.36
but remember, especially this kind of letters that like this actual person. It's not just some cool letter.

1300
02:15:33.36 --> 02:15:38.24
You know, kind of thing. It's like this actual person writing this letter to an actual person.

1301
02:15:38.24 --> 02:15:45.36
Just like all about an actual person. Yeah, about James Trobridge. Yeah, crazy.

1302
02:15:47.20 --> 02:15:49.60
All right, well, I guess we can talk about origin.

1303
02:15:51.52 --> 02:15:58.80
Made in America, I guess there's that. There's that. So yeah, so again, origin. Yeah, so they have American-made

1304
02:15:58.80 --> 02:16:05.04
products. Good products, too. As in the best. Yeah, I think they're the best. Like here's the thing.

1305
02:16:05.04 --> 02:16:10.24
You know, when people are like, yeah, they got the best thing. It's like in some matter of opinion. So I can't tell you

1306
02:16:10.24 --> 02:16:15.52
they're the best, but I can't tell you. I think can you not say it's the best key. Yeah, oh, it's the best key. Okay.

1307
02:16:15.52 --> 02:16:21.36
Factually. That's a factually thing. Yeah. So keys. So yeah, if, okay, on the path, we're on the path. They're

1308
02:16:21.36 --> 02:16:27.12
burying on the path. On the path. You just as part of that path. Optional. For sure, optional, but it is part of the path.

1309
02:16:27.44 --> 02:16:32.16
It's not not part of the path. It's the same. So maybe questioning whether it's optional. Yeah.

1310
02:16:32.16 --> 02:16:38.08
No, no, no, no, because you've heard of people who don't necessarily do Gigietsu, but they're on the path.

1311
02:16:38.08 --> 02:16:44.08
Oh, my path. Yeah. Yeah, you should try and change Gigietsu though. It's my recommendation. It's like strongly

1312
02:16:44.08 --> 02:16:50.000
recommend. Dave. Recommendation? Yeah, you're nice. Gigietsu. It's not a recommendation. You need to do it.

1313
02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:55.04
Yeah, it's weird. It's just, it's something unlike anything else I've ever done, and it's something

1314
02:16:55.04 --> 02:17:03.36
you need to do. And it's there's a million different reasons to do it. And it's look echo. It's not an option.

1315
02:17:03.36 --> 02:17:07.36
If you're on the path, you're training. You're a beautiful, they've worked. But not work.

1316
02:17:07.36 --> 02:17:11.68
Right. So by the way, representing the origin t-shirt. Big time. If someone's wondering

1317
02:17:11.68 --> 02:17:19.12
about the gizy knee boy. So yeah, boom, there you go. So when you start your gitsu or if you're on the

1318
02:17:19.12 --> 02:17:25.44
gitsu path, they're ready. You need a new Gigi. Origin Gip, S1 made in America 100%. Cotton's made in

1319
02:17:25.44 --> 02:17:29.92
America. They make the cotton into a gig with with other stuff. Obviously because it's, you know, a

1320
02:17:29.92 --> 02:17:36.56
Gigi. They got raskards in other jiu jitsu stuff on there as well. OriginMain.com.

1321
02:17:37.84 --> 02:17:41.92
joggers. Okay, how you feel about joggers? Overall, I mean, we've come along with it's face it.

1322
02:17:41.92 --> 02:17:46.56
How you feel about joggers? We're talking about me. If you are indicating that I have made some

1323
02:17:46.56 --> 02:17:51.92
movement towards, I'm going to be sport repair joggers. If that's what you're thinking, it's not.

1324
02:17:51.92 --> 02:17:57.04
You know, there's been no movement. No movement. Still like no movement. No, the pre phase one. Pre phase

1325
02:17:57.04 --> 02:18:01.12
one. Yep. They're not happening for me. Would you say anti joggers? Possibly. Because I've been

1326
02:18:01.12 --> 02:18:05.76
wearing a lot of anti. I don't look at people and say, oh man, I can't believe that guy is wearing

1327
02:18:05.76 --> 02:18:10.40
joggers. I don't care about it that much. Right, right. But it's still like it's a zero. It's not a negative.

1328
02:18:10.40 --> 02:18:16.16
Yes, just like the jiu jitsu. Zero. Well, I don't get it. Yeah, I did get man.

1329
02:18:16.16 --> 02:18:20.56
There's a lot of things that you might not get. Nonetheless, I am not in that boat. I mean,

1330
02:18:20.56 --> 02:18:25.52
just a lot of things. I'm just saying there are things that you kind of don't get. Right off.

1331
02:18:25.52 --> 02:18:29.84
Overall, they've been so much in the middle of the river. Anyway, joggers. T-shirts. Obviously,

1332
02:18:29.84 --> 02:18:35.36
Dave Burke representing big time hardcore. If you will. Big time. Big time. Huge time. Actually,

1333
02:18:35.36 --> 02:18:42.40
yeah, look at that shirt. It's dope. Anyway, there are a sweats as well. You know, sweats

1334
02:18:42.40 --> 02:18:46.32
are most comfortable in the world. That's factually. That's like not even matter opinion.

1335
02:18:46.32 --> 02:18:51.04
Sure. Sounds like it's not though. Also supplements. Okay. Dave Burke. You're on the

1336
02:18:51.04 --> 02:18:55.68
dis, okay. There's supplements, right? Jockel, super krill oil. For you joins Omega 3's all that

1337
02:18:55.68 --> 02:19:02.32
anti-oxidants in there. All kinds of stuff. Good for your joints legitimately. Yeah. Not this,

1338
02:19:02.88 --> 02:19:08.80
you don't want a day, a commercial thing. This is for real good for your joints. That's that.

1339
02:19:08.80 --> 02:19:14.16
Joint warfare. Good for your joints in a different way. But very good for your joints. Discipline.

1340
02:19:14.16 --> 02:19:21.76
Good for your brain. Good for your muscles. Called discipline. Prework out pre cognitive, not pre

1341
02:19:21.76 --> 02:19:26.16
cognitive, but pre mission. We'll call it cognitive enhancing neutral. Okay. Well, you know,

1342
02:19:26.16 --> 02:19:32.24
who's down with the discipline? Dave Burke. I am down with the discipline. What? When do you take it?

1343
02:19:32.24 --> 02:19:38.56
I take it usually twice a day. So get up workout. I'm tracking for a while in about 10-10

1344
02:19:38.56 --> 02:19:44.000
30. And that's about the time I sit down and I have to, I got a grind at my computer and I really

1345
02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:49.28
don't want to, but I need to. And I got to put my brain into the thing, I will take discipline

1346
02:19:49.28 --> 02:19:54.56
and I will crank for a while. And then the other time I do it is typically like post bedtime

1347
02:19:54.56 --> 02:20:01.68
the kids. And I would really like to do is just call it a day. Oh, oh. But I can't get some. Yeah,

1348
02:20:01.68 --> 02:20:08.16
I got it. And that's, that's what I'll take it. What about pre-gejitsu? I every time I go train

1349
02:20:08.16 --> 02:20:15.20
on the drive. I thought it would be like, well, no, not really because of it. Yeah, he's like, no, every time I go train.

1350
02:20:15.20 --> 02:20:20.000
I was mixing one up at the house today and he said, oh, what are we going wrong? And I was like, yeah,

1351
02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:25.12
he goes and I guess I'm going to do that. You had to read legit schools there. These are keeping

1352
02:20:25.12 --> 02:20:29.12
schools here. I think it might end up being four. And I don't know if you noticed this, but I had a

1353
02:20:29.12 --> 02:20:33.84
pretty small water bottle. Yeah. So I'm, I'm mixing up these super charged

1354
02:20:33.84 --> 02:20:41.52
things. Yeah, I'm going to stop. I have eaten it before. It doesn't taste good brawl, right?

1355
02:20:41.52 --> 02:20:49.44
You don't. But I have to. But anyway, so that's discipline. I did. And then you, you take

1356
02:20:49.44 --> 02:20:55.20
milk. Again, this is good that you're here because I tell everyone it tastes good that to me.

1357
02:20:56.08 --> 02:21:02.000
But I'm only one person. You like it too. Minced your flavor too, right? Okay, so here's the thing.

1358
02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:07.12
I got to explain that because you're here. They broke your here. You're on the discipline train.

1359
02:21:07.12 --> 02:21:14.32
I dig it. I'm on the milk train. Okay. So what the heck? Here's the thing. I never was. And even like,

1360
02:21:15.04 --> 02:21:21.04
you know, even a pepperacopicase. A number of episodes ago, I would say more than once, by the way.

1361
02:21:21.60 --> 02:21:26.24
Down like protein powder, that's what the kids take to make them think they're getting big.

1362
02:21:26.24 --> 02:21:32.72
Whatever. Right. That's kind of how I felt about it. And I, you know, okay. Okay. We'll say that.

1363
02:21:32.72 --> 02:21:40.32
But okay. So Pete sent me the vanilla. Is in a blank container. It's not coming. Yeah. Yeah.

1364
02:21:40.32 --> 02:21:45.20
So it's kind of like, something like cool. I put it in. I was like, dang. This is pretty good.

1365
02:21:45.20 --> 02:21:50.80
Yeah. It's interesting. It's vanilla, by the way. Yeah. So it's not a good flavor, right? I think even like

1366
02:21:50.80 --> 02:21:56.16
one of the definitions of vanilla is like, it's just cool. It's fine. We're not excited about

1367
02:21:56.16 --> 02:22:00.16
vanilla. Yeah. But it's good. You know, we were a little bit. I got a little bit excited. So I'm like,

1368
02:22:00.16 --> 02:22:04.80
hmm, but it could be my bias. You know, it's Pete. You know, thanks. Pete, you know, you get the big

1369
02:22:04.80 --> 02:22:08.40
box. You're all excited. It could be, you know, you could be by yourself. So I'm like, all right,

1370
02:22:08.40 --> 02:22:13.44
you know what the test is? Here's the test. I have a one year or two year. He's almost two. Oh, yeah.

1371
02:22:13.44 --> 02:22:18.64
So I'm like, all right. Let me. So I give it to him. I don't recommend giving them a bunch. I don't

1372
02:22:18.64 --> 02:22:25.36
know if all the protein, 22 grams of protein, by the way. Yeah. Two grams of sugar. No, one gram of sugar.

1373
02:22:25.36 --> 02:22:31.20
Yeah. Two total carbs. Two grams of fat, by the way, which I mean, feel how you want to feel about

1374
02:22:31.20 --> 02:22:35.60
fat like it's good or whatever, but Brad, this is a for real protein deal. Like you want extra protein,

1375
02:22:35.60 --> 02:22:39.60
they're not going to give you a bunch of stuff. You didn't sign up for anyway. I don't. So I'm like,

1376
02:22:39.60 --> 02:22:43.68
okay, my son's, do you have a real problem with things that you don't sign up for? I know to

1377
02:22:43.68 --> 02:22:48.24
set about you. Like that's one year things. One of them. Yeah. Don't sign up for something and it

1378
02:22:48.24 --> 02:22:52.32
comes anyways. You don't like that unless it's a box of good stuff from Pete, then you didn't sign up for

1379
02:22:52.32 --> 02:23:00.16
everybody do like that. There is that. Yes. So boom. I give it to him. Mix it up. No, by the way,

1380
02:23:00.16 --> 02:23:06.56
just to beat in the spirit of accuracy. Boom hit it. Yeah. He liked it. So I'm like, oh, okay, but it could

1381
02:23:06.56 --> 02:23:11.52
be one of those things. Was that meant? Was that vanilla? No, vanilla, vanilla. Yeah. So I'm like,

1382
02:23:11.52 --> 02:23:15.76
all right, well, it could be an amelina. You give like someone that maybe found a, I don't know,

1383
02:23:15.76 --> 02:23:20.16
he'll taste it. You know, he's like more, more, more, more. So I'm trying to get out my phone.

1384
02:23:20.16 --> 02:23:24.72
So I get a video to send to Pete and he's like, Boris, kind of tripping. So I'm like, all right,

1385
02:23:24.72 --> 02:23:29.28
so I finally get the video going and I give it to him. Yeah, he wants it. Once the milk,

1386
02:23:29.28 --> 02:23:33.60
to hear a drinking milk, not say to give it to you to you. I'm saying as a taste test, that works.

1387
02:23:33.60 --> 02:23:40.40
That's vanilla, by the way. So anyway, just confirmed confirmed and that's vanilla. So I like the

1388
02:23:40.40 --> 02:23:49.44
the mint chocolate. Yeah. 100%. And peanut butter chocolate is now live at origin main.com.

1389
02:23:49.44 --> 02:23:54.32
Is that official? That was official. That's official. Yes. All right. That is official. So all my Twitter

1390
02:23:54.32 --> 02:24:01.20
competition of who's going to get the first peanut butter chocolate is on. It's good too. It's good.

1391
02:24:01.20 --> 02:24:05.92
Because I've had it because we we tested it and we went through like three. It didn't, the cool thing is

1392
02:24:06.64 --> 02:24:10.40
it didn't take that many iterations to get it. It was like a little bit more chocolate,

1393
02:24:10.40 --> 02:24:14.96
a little bit more peanut butter. All right. I think it was three iterations and we were good.

1394
02:24:14.96 --> 02:24:22.000
I will say this. Send it. Oh, yeah, please. I put like a half a tablespoon of peanut butter

1395
02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:28.64
in the mint chocolate. Right. As a test and boom, I like that too. So there we go. So yeah,

1396
02:24:28.64 --> 02:24:31.28
we're getting it for that. Anyway, yeah, and don't forget the crew are in the joint war

1397
02:24:31.28 --> 02:24:36.48
for this. These are daily things. We need this. Yeah. Take it from me. We need this. It'll run out.

1398
02:24:36.48 --> 02:24:45.60
Also, good way to support and represent because representing is a method of support. In my opinion.

1399
02:24:46.48 --> 02:24:53.60
Jocquad store. It's called Jocquad store. You can get Jocquad gier rash guards. Jocquad gear. Like it's

1400
02:24:53.60 --> 02:25:00.32
like more geared towards the game. Good after it all that stuff. Anyway, yeah,

1401
02:25:00.32 --> 02:25:04.08
rash guards t-shirts, dyslinicals, freedom, all these things. A lot of stuff concepts

1402
02:25:04.08 --> 02:25:10.56
conceptually representing by way of a peril. You don't like the word a peril. No, I'm sorry.

1403
02:25:10.56 --> 02:25:15.12
A peril clothing. Yeah, those things are fashion. No. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's the

1404
02:25:15.12 --> 02:25:20.64
right. Okay. Got you. So anyway, accessories. If you will, some hats on there, some good stuff,

1405
02:25:20.64 --> 02:25:24.80
some whims stuff on there. If you want to represent, go to jocquad store.com. That's where you get the

1406
02:25:24.80 --> 02:25:30.16
stuff. Also, you want to subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already. Seems obvious, right?

1407
02:25:30.16 --> 02:25:37.52
And that's on stature, iTunes, Google Play. You know, all these places where they play podcast,

1408
02:25:37.52 --> 02:25:42.16
good way to support and leave a review. And don't forget about this podcast. Also, there's a war

1409
02:25:42.16 --> 02:25:48.88
your kid podcast. Yes. So subscribe to the war, war your kid podcast. Dave Burke was the first

1410
02:25:48.88 --> 02:25:54.88
guests on the war your kid podcast. Number 16, which is out at this time. If you want to hear him

1411
02:25:54.88 --> 02:26:02.48
answer questions from children about being a Marine Corps fighter pilot. And there's also some

1412
02:26:02.48 --> 02:26:09.36
stories from Uncle Jake in the most recent three podcasts, 14, 15 and 16. There's some stories from

1413
02:26:09.36 --> 02:26:17.76
Uncle Jake talking about how Uncle Jake kind of established his principles in life. So those are

1414
02:26:17.76 --> 02:26:25.36
pretty cool. And in addition to the war your kid podcast being available through the various podcast

1415
02:26:25.36 --> 02:26:33.36
channels, it is also available on YouTube on a separate channel from the jockel podcast YouTube channel,

1416
02:26:33.92 --> 02:26:42.16
which has this podcast on it, which is pretty cool. But it also has the custom, custom,

1417
02:26:42.16 --> 02:26:54.32
artistic videos videos. I was looking enhanced and wicked cool videos from echo Charles with about

1418
02:26:54.32 --> 02:27:00.72
whatever. And well, hey, this event, we just actually David and I just didn't event and they played

1419
02:27:00.72 --> 02:27:08.08
the war path video, but good one. And it was on, no, this is legit. He was on a giant screen with a

1420
02:27:08.08 --> 02:27:14.40
six sound system. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Actually, that legitimately doesn't make

1421
02:27:14.40 --> 02:27:21.92
me feel good. Yeah. And a big, big crystal clear HD TV something with a whole deal.

1422
02:27:21.92 --> 02:27:27.36
A little fork. It is a fork. It was mass. Probably. Oh. And I was like four feet from it,

1423
02:27:27.36 --> 02:27:30.88
because we were about to walk on stage. So I was real close to it. Yeah. And he was got the

1424
02:27:30.88 --> 02:27:38.000
police. Yeah. I'm in that video. Yeah. You are. You do your Ninja pose. Yeah. Ninja Jedi. I don't think

1425
02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:43.52
Ninja's do. Nonetheless, the YouTube thing I was thinking about this too, sometimes like when

1426
02:27:43.52 --> 02:27:46.96
when podcasts come out, not necessarily, but you know, other podcasts or whatever, sometimes they'll

1427
02:27:46.96 --> 02:27:51.84
put it on YouTube, but they'll just have the image on there. Oh, yeah. Just for another source of audio,

1428
02:27:51.84 --> 02:27:57.52
which is good. But you get, you got to add it to mention where we do. It is a video, so if you want

1429
02:27:57.52 --> 02:28:01.44
to see what Dave Burke looks like, if you don't know, I'm saying, if you would. I'm going to see what

1430
02:28:01.44 --> 02:28:05.60
Jockel looks like. If for some reason, I don't know. Boom. You can tell he looks like that picture.

1431
02:28:05.60 --> 02:28:12.64
Somebody posted of what they thought you looked like. I'm going to ask that question on the

1432
02:28:12.64 --> 02:28:19.60
source. I'm going to say, what did you think echo Charles looked like? Yeah. Yeah. That seems like

1433
02:28:19.60 --> 02:28:24.40
that. What did you think echo Charles looked like? I think it looks exactly the way he does.

1434
02:28:24.40 --> 02:28:28.32
I was not an elisput surprise. Oh, you, you. Okay. Yeah. It's good. Deal Dave Burke. Yeah. I know

1437
02:28:38.72 --> 02:28:42.56
long before I mentioned all, but you know, you can tell. Yeah. You can tell. You can tell.

1438
02:28:42.56 --> 02:28:46.96
I don't know why. Well, boom. There it is. YouTube subscribe. If you want, if you, uh, you know,

1440
02:28:53.68 --> 02:28:58.88

1441
02:28:59.84 --> 02:29:04.08
Vitting come in. Yeah. You said, I think it's good for my workout. I got planned. Oh, and I got

1442
02:29:04.08 --> 02:29:08.72

1443
02:29:08.72 --> 02:29:13.68
have rings. Did not have rings. This is a point. I had pull a bar, you know, that kind of, but I don't

1444
02:29:13.68 --> 02:29:19.12
have rings. I have rings now. I didn't come in yet. But anyway, you go to on it dot com slash

1445
02:29:19.12 --> 02:29:24.80
job. Good stuff on. Oh, sorry. Slash. Jockel. Not Joc. On it dot com slash jockel. They got some good

1446
02:29:24.80 --> 02:29:28.64
workout stuff on there. A lot of good info, too. That's where I went when I was when I started

1447
02:29:28.64 --> 02:29:34.24
in the kettlebell routine. Mm-hmm. Got the info from there. Ball. Good stuff. Get some socks, too.

1448
02:29:34.24 --> 02:29:39.04
That's when psychological warfare album. You can get it album with tracks, bubble, bubble,

1449
02:29:39.04 --> 02:29:41.76
ball. No, where's the deal? What's the deal? What's the deal? What's the deal? What's the deal?

1450
02:29:41.76 --> 02:29:43.28
Okay, if you don't know what that is. If you don't know what that is, if you don't know what that is,

1451
02:29:43.28 --> 02:29:47.68
I tuned. Go to Google Play. Go to MP3. You can get an album with me talking about why you shouldn't

1452
02:29:47.68 --> 02:29:51.68
be weak for the various reasons. That's it. It's all we're saying about it. Other than to say,

1453
02:29:51.68 --> 02:29:58.88
we are working on the new psychological warfare album. However, each time I say that, I should,

1454
02:29:58.88 --> 02:30:04.80
I should caveat that by saying I have had a lot of other things to do. So I am. The work I have

1455
02:30:04.80 --> 02:30:12.72
done so far on the new psychological warfare album is to begin to consider topics for the next album.

1456
02:30:12.72 --> 02:30:18.000
I have a small list. It will be rolled out. What do you think will be rolled out? Oh, when?

1457
02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:21.84
Oh, yeah, people are smoking. But it's that really. Yeah. First, like what someone's out there,

1458
02:30:21.84 --> 02:30:25.04
that wants to quit smoking. Yeah, okay. All right. So we're on that. We'll put it out there.

1459
02:30:25.04 --> 02:30:29.12
The new psychological warfare. We do have a working title, which seems to be sticking pretty well.

1460
02:30:30.40 --> 02:30:35.28
All your excuses are lies. Psychological warfare, too. That's the one. Hopefully,

1461
02:30:35.28 --> 02:30:41.92
be better than jaws, too. But not terminated, too. But not terminated, too. I'm just saying terminated, too.

1462
02:30:41.92 --> 02:30:46.32
It was, it was just as iconic as terminated one. We're good. Then,

1463
02:30:46.32 --> 02:30:52.48
jocquawaiti, you can get it on Amazon. You can get the dry tea bags and mix it yourself or you can get it into

1464
02:30:52.48 --> 02:30:55.84
can. And if you get it, no big deal, you can deadlift 8,000 pounds.

1465
02:30:57.20 --> 02:31:04.40
Way the warrior kid books. Dave, you've read them. I've read them multiple times. They are on reread in the house.

1466
02:31:04.40 --> 02:31:15.28
You got three kids ages nine seven four and their feedback is feedback is solid. The girls love the books.

1467
02:31:16.16 --> 02:31:20.40
Interesting. People ask me, what about girls? Are you going to write a book for girls? I did write a book for

1468
02:31:20.40 --> 02:31:24.56
the guys that's called Way the Warrior Kid. Yep. A great thing. Absolutely. My

1469
02:31:24.56 --> 02:31:28.72
lessons are universal. Kids love it. My girls love it. Girls start to train in jiu-jitsu because of the

1470
02:31:28.72 --> 02:31:35.44
book. That's awesome. Yep. Do they study? Oh yeah, they study. Do they eat a little bit more healthy?

1471
02:31:36.32 --> 02:31:42.40
Look, they're on the path. They're on the path. They're on the path. It's legit. That's awesome.

1472
02:31:42.40 --> 02:31:48.40
And I actually talked to your kids occasionally and I see that they are in the fact on the path.

1473
02:31:49.20 --> 02:31:54.80
What about the field manual? They have not read the field, you'll manual. I have read the field manual.

1474
02:31:54.80 --> 02:32:03.60
Feedback. Feedback is also legit. It is a prescription. If you need some help on getting and

1475
02:32:03.60 --> 02:32:10.08
staying on the path, read the field manual. Have you read three pages of the field manual just

1476
02:32:10.08 --> 02:32:14.64
because? Three pages? Have you ever just been like, you know you're sitting there and it's on your

1477
02:32:14.64 --> 02:32:18.96
desk and you're like, you know what? I'm going to read this real quick. Yeah. So the thing about the book

1478
02:32:18.96 --> 02:32:27.60
is the cover of the book. That cover says open this book. It covers awesome. That hard cover is legit,

1479
02:32:27.60 --> 02:32:32.32
man. They ask me like, why don't you like to roll this off cover? I'm like, uh, never. No,

1480
02:32:32.32 --> 02:32:37.92
that is not a soft cover book. No, it is not. No, there's an iconic picture they say.

1481
02:32:37.92 --> 02:32:43.68
Echo says there's an iconic picture. He said a photographer that took the picture had a incredible

1482
02:32:43.68 --> 02:32:51.12
day that day. Sense for art. Okay. And say that for the soft cover? None of them. Oh, yes.

1483
02:32:51.12 --> 02:32:55.20
Okay. What the picture looks like there's no soft cover. No, there's no soft cover. Well,

1484
02:32:55.20 --> 02:33:01.52
it is actually when I said it's an iconic picture. It means less of the notion or the idea that

1485
02:33:01.52 --> 02:33:06.80
I took a great picture or nothing. Like this. I'm saying that picture that we took in my hallway.

1486
02:33:07.36 --> 02:33:13.60
One random night. My cheap camera became a picture that's kind of representative iconic.

1487
02:33:13.60 --> 02:33:19.36
If you will. Okay. So he's claiming it of, you know, your whole. He's trying to downplay it. It could

1488
02:33:19.36 --> 02:33:25.44
be called iconic. I think that I took. No, I'm not. No big deal. Well, you look at where the

1489
02:33:25.44 --> 02:33:32.000
word kid, the picture on the back of the one I took down too. But is that iconic? Not it did push me

1490
02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:36.64
in that direction necessarily, but the one on the cover of this movie was for you. Field. Oh, yeah.

1491
02:33:36.64 --> 02:33:44.24
And you'll is the publisher wanted a picture of me when I looked more approachable. The one on the back.

1492
02:33:44.24 --> 02:33:48.16
The one on the back cover. Yeah. The word shirt line. And there's something about the word your

1493
02:33:48.16 --> 02:33:51.68
kid books that you didn't mention though. You said you wrote a kids book that's for boys and girls.

1494
02:33:52.32 --> 02:33:58.000
That's actually a book for adults. Do. Yeah. Now that's not just not just for the adults.

1495
02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:03.36
There are lessons for the adults, but that book is a great parenting group. That's a legit parenting

1496
02:34:03.36 --> 02:34:10.40
tool that I now get to go. Is that what Mark would do? What would Uncle Jake say here? And I actually

1497
02:34:10.40 --> 02:34:15.36
get to parent less now. Because I just reference the book. That's that's no joke, man. I know that

1498
02:34:15.36 --> 02:34:20.32
word. Ultimate flank. It is. It really is. It's also a flank because the here's the problem.

1499
02:34:20.32 --> 02:34:26.32
Kids do not listen to their parents. Kids listen to a certain percentage of what their parents say.

1500
02:34:26.32 --> 02:34:32.08
And there's a certain portion of them that is programmed to rebel against you as a parent.

1501
02:34:32.08 --> 02:34:36.48
They're programmed that way. And the more you fight it, the worse it's going to get. You come in

1502
02:34:36.48 --> 02:34:43.20
from the flank. Boom. There you go. Yeah. That's true. Good point. What about Dave? This is your big

1503
02:34:43.20 --> 02:34:51.68
night. What about extreme ownership? Feedback. Feedback. I have read that book several times. I've

1504
02:34:51.68 --> 02:34:58.64
listened to it. I reference the book constantly because of the work that we do. And I get a lot of

1505
02:34:58.64 --> 02:35:06.08
feedback on that book. That is the book that when you talk about when you see it broadly,

1506
02:35:06.08 --> 02:35:10.96
that quote from Masashi, you start to see it everywhere. That's what that book is. Yeah.

1507
02:35:10.96 --> 02:35:17.44
Because once you tip on that and once that gets embedded in your DNA, once you start doing that,

1508
02:35:17.44 --> 02:35:24.80
you will see that everywhere. And that is what's unique about that book. Yes. The best feedback

1509
02:35:24.80 --> 02:35:31.12
I've ever gotten on that book from people we were going to say, it just makes sense. Yeah.

1510
02:35:32.80 --> 02:35:37.36
We have a follow on to that book coming out. It's called the dichotomy leadership. It's about

1511
02:35:37.36 --> 02:35:42.000
all those opposing forces you face as leader. And I talked about the ultimate dichotomy tonight.

1512
02:35:43.04 --> 02:35:51.44
And so that book comes out September 25th. Also, if you need live training, you need a little

1513
02:35:51.44 --> 02:35:58.32
bit more than the book. You need a little bit more than the podcast. You can bring us inside your

1514
02:35:58.32 --> 02:36:02.56
organization. We have a company called National Front. That's what Dave was talking about tonight.

1515
02:36:02.56 --> 02:36:05.20
I was talking about tonight. All the companies that we work with. That's what we're talking about.

1516
02:36:05.20 --> 02:36:13.28
We solve problems through leadership. Boom. Me, Lave, JP, Dave Burke, Flynn,

1517
02:36:13.28 --> 02:36:19.28
Cochrane. And now we also have Mike Surelli in the House. All right. What about the

1518
02:36:19.28 --> 02:36:24.96
monster? Mustard six coming up San Francisco. This will be my fifth monster.

1519
02:36:25.84 --> 02:36:28.48
Oh, yeah. Sorry. You missed the first one. I did. I did not make the first

1520
02:36:28.48 --> 02:36:34.96
monster. But this monster, like every other monster, is a going to be awesome. And b, it's going to sell

1521
02:36:34.96 --> 02:36:40.16
out. Yeah. Actually, it's going to sell out. It's almost there. Yeah. Yeah. I talked to Jimmy just the other

1522
02:36:40.16 --> 02:36:44.80
day about it. We are tracking way ahead of where we expected. Yeah. I'm going to sell out soon. You got to get on it.

1523
02:36:44.80 --> 02:36:51.52
Now, because of the monster, we actually designed something else because we wanted to do something.

1524
02:36:51.52 --> 02:36:56.56
First of all, the monsters got a pretty high price point. It's pretty expensive. And it focuses

1525
02:36:56.56 --> 02:37:02.96
on real broad leadership across the board. But we have had come to all the monsters.

1526
02:37:05.28 --> 02:37:10.48
Law enforcement, military, border patrol, fire fighters, paramedics, other first responders.

1527
02:37:10.48 --> 02:37:17.84
We wanted to do something a little bit, a little bit focused on what they do for a living. So we have

1528
02:37:17.84 --> 02:37:25.52
something called the role call. It is September 21st in Dallas, Texas. It's one day leadership

1529
02:37:25.52 --> 02:37:33.60
seminar for everyone out there in uniform. So if you're a police officer, if you're a firefighter,

1530
02:37:33.60 --> 02:37:38.000
and we've worked with police officers and firefighters and we've worked with border patrol,

1531
02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:43.68
and we've worked with military units and we still do all of that. But if you want to come and get a

1532
02:37:43.68 --> 02:37:51.68
one day immersion into the combat leadership principles that we talk about in the book,

1533
02:37:51.68 --> 02:37:59.28
extreme ownership that we talk about on this podcast, come to the role call, September 21st in Dallas,

1534
02:37:59.28 --> 02:38:07.68
Texas. And for both the monster and the role call, you can register for those at extreme ownership.com.

1535
02:38:08.72 --> 02:38:17.52
On top of all of that, we have something now called echelon front Overwatch. EF Overwatch.com.

1536
02:38:18.32 --> 02:38:25.76
And Dave, you've been involved pretty heavily in us standing that up. We are, we in our business,

1537
02:38:25.76 --> 02:38:31.44
working with companies, we are always running into companies that need, what do they need?

1538
02:38:31.44 --> 02:38:37.44
They need good leaders. They need good people. And because of our connections to the military,

1539
02:38:37.44 --> 02:38:43.12
all of us having spent extended periods of time in the military and special operation as combat

1540
02:38:43.12 --> 02:38:50.24
pilots, we have connections there. And this is a place where we have an opportunity to bring

1541
02:38:50.24 --> 02:38:56.40
those two things together. People that want great leaders and people that are great leaders that need

1542
02:38:56.40 --> 02:39:01.68
jobs. So we're bringing those together. Whether you're somebody who wants to employ people or

1543
02:39:01.68 --> 02:39:10.16
whether you're looking to be employed as a spec ops individual or a combat pilot,

1544
02:39:11.60 --> 02:39:17.44
then go to EF Overwatch.com, put your information in there. And we will proceed down the line of

1545
02:39:17.44 --> 02:39:23.92
getting you the best people you get. And I miss anything on EF Overwatch. Yeah, it's like you said

1546
02:39:23.92 --> 02:39:29.20
and the best thing for the transitioning folks. If you're looking for a new mission to find your

1547
02:39:29.20 --> 02:39:34.40
next mission, you have to transition out of the service. This is the place to do it. Coming get some.

1548
02:39:35.76 --> 02:39:41.76
And if you want to kind of keep carrying on this conversation with us virtually,

1549
02:39:41.76 --> 02:39:49.84
that isn't until we see you live either at the master or at the roll call or at the immersion

1550
02:39:49.84 --> 02:39:57.52
camp up in Maine, then you can find us all on the interwebs on Twitter, on Instagram, and on Dash

1551
02:39:57.52 --> 02:40:10.96
Facebook. Dave is at David R. Burke. Be. E. R. K. E. Because that's a thing. I mean, you always forget

1552
02:40:10.96 --> 02:40:19.12
your own thing. You're like Dave R. Burke. Yeah. David R. Burke. Correct. Yeah. That's where you are. And

1553
02:40:19.12 --> 02:40:24.72
you're there. You're there on Twitter and on Instagram. Yep. And on that Facebook. He's

1554
02:40:24.72 --> 02:40:31.20
like a lot of echoers. Of course, echo Charles and I am at Jockel. Like echo. Anything else?

1555
02:40:31.20 --> 02:40:36.40
No, good to see you again, Dave Burke. Actually, you talk about him always texting you about

1556
02:40:36.40 --> 02:40:41.84
your Jits and stuff. He calls me to think. Yeah. Yeah. It's great. Yeah. That's how it is, man.

1557
02:40:41.84 --> 02:40:45.04
One of those things we see is they when you're phone, you can't get happy. Yeah. Just for, you know,

1558
02:40:45.04 --> 02:40:50.08
you get happy and you like man was arm lock question. Escape at the mild question.

1559
02:40:50.08 --> 02:40:55.36
No. That's tough. Good deal. Dave. Great to see you. Good deal. Dave Burke. Any closing comments?

1560
02:40:55.36 --> 02:40:59.92
Dude, thanks for having me back, man. I could do this all day. I appreciate the chance to talk again.

1561
02:41:00.96 --> 02:41:04.80
Being a part of this is a big deal for me. Thank you. David. Awesome to have you on.

1562
02:41:06.24 --> 02:41:14.16
And again, thanks for everything that you've done for me and done for our freedom as a nation.

1563
02:41:14.16 --> 02:41:21.20
And I'm sure we will do this many times again in the future. So yeah, this is just the beginning.

1564
02:41:21.20 --> 02:41:26.000
My brother right on. And everyone else in the military, that is out there right now,

1565
02:41:26.24 --> 02:41:31.04
protecting our freedom. Thank you. And to the first responders, police law enforcement,

1566
02:41:31.04 --> 02:41:38.48
board of patrol, firefighters, paramedics, thanks for keeping us and our families safe and to

1567
02:41:38.48 --> 02:41:46.80
everyone else. That is listening. Thank you. Thank you for listening. Thank you for supporting.

1568
02:41:48.32 --> 02:41:56.08
And thanks for remembering the heroes that gave their lives so that liberty and democracy

1569
02:41:58.16 --> 02:42:05.04
can survive and let the names of the fallen forever.

1570
02:42:05.04 --> 02:42:18.16
Forever be as unparishable as those glorious ideals for which they made the ultimate sacrifice.

1571
02:42:18.16 --> 02:42:34.08
And until next time, this is Dave and Echo and Jockel. Out.
