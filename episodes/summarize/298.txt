yeah little details after this here you you detail you go through some of the details of operation towards which is up in North Africa the Sabu River it's it's success you know it's a tough operation five of the 10 original tuna fish get the navy cross from that operation and again I'm skipping through some of that right now get the book get the book and read about that freaking operation because it's epic um the origination you know we've said this a couple times but the origination of everything that goes on here is is you you have to tell talk about the raiders you have to talk about the rangers you have to talk about why why why what happened to them and why they didn't become seals or at least this seal type thing this is a section here where you start talking about um well the rangers so the premise is you know that the navy should never have had this capability when I started trying to come up with a title for the book I warn the my options for sub-pitals were like something like the origin story the navy seals at unit that should not exist something like that something is you know provocative like like that and the reason they shouldn't exist is because of the army and the marine queen the industry I all of these institutions were better suited for this mission than the navy was uh so in order to you know explain the question that I you know ask at the beginning how the navy you know come to field this you know land focus go anywhere commando for us um the way that's phrased is you have to understand why these other institutions didn't uh become that first why they didn't block the navy from becoming that and only in understanding why they didn't become that can you understand really understand why the navy did it why the navy felt like it had to do it that includes the rangers going to the book the officer selected to command the rangers 31 year old major William Orlando Derby born in Fort Smith our can saw in 1911 the same guerrilla studded year as Lord Lovat and Russell Volkman Derby grew up believing that he was destined for greatness of average size and looks as greatness laid below the surface as it as it is so often with tragic men a war would be to require to uncover it black hair blue eyed wide mouth as a duck Derby had a ruddy face divided into equal parts forehead and chin his left cheek borham mysterious brilliant red scar not particularly muscular he nevertheless affected chest out shoulders back posture in which his arms seemed to always cock to the rear as if never more than a moment away from snapping to attention son of a printer and a musician the second child between two sisters he grew up scouting the Arkansas woods and playing the saxophone while in high school his older sister died in Texas he married then divorced in spite of disappointment and tragedy his attitude remained as it ever had been good humored and irrepressible in personality just like his posture he was direct forceful and never vacillating had the military gnaut dominated and given and driven him to a life of soldiering he would have made a born salesman he is the ideal commando leader wrote Colonel Vaughn at the end of the course he possesses the energy keenness and personality which produces the best out of those under his command graduated from west point in 1933 at the apex of the bell curve ranked 177 out of 346 he was originally assigned as a field artillery officer fast forward a little bit if the ideal army officer was equal parts confidence bravery energy and obedience Darby was all these things but perhaps too much the last more than anything he believed his men could and should perform any mission assigned to them from the most audacious lightning raids to the most ignominious re-rational on duties to the most spectacular seized season hold operations because of this no one would be more responsible for proving the value of the Rangers or for their downfall so you go into talking about their first experience the Rangers first combat experience who choose in deep Yeah that was a tough chapter sorry that was a tough chapter to sort of figure out what we're the center of gravity of this thing is like what because the I mean just the the number of Raider organizations that the Navy sponsors during this period they sponsor the Marine Corps UDT group which is the special operations group at the time the sag they sponsor UDT led British commandos they sponsor army Raiders they I mean everybody is trying to figure out how to you know do sort of what the Koreans were doing to the US military at that point which is bottled up in the Poo-Song perimeter it's like you know we've been watching a Poo-Song perimeter moment in Afghanistan there lack of leadership lack of planning lack of resourcing you know forces army are the US forces back into this the small pocket and they're doing everything they can to sort of not necessarily break out of it but at least you know not do nothing and the not doing nothing is trying to cut the North Koreans supply lines and and the one advantage that they have when the with the Korean Peninsula is all of these arteries all these roads because of the the spine of the the North Korean Geography is they push everything to the to the edges of the peninsula so this is the first time the Navy really sees you know this huge opportunity to start you know sponsoring raids ashore that's the first time that the UDT which is the only special operations unit that survives disbandment in World War II that's the that's the moment that they cease to be just beach marking or just reconnaissance troops and demolition troops and they start going ashore anyway so the problem is you know the the army has moved be at move past all of his ideas they you know they they entertain him they entertain these ideas for a period and as you see throughout his service the army plucks these things off the table one at a time leaving him to go back to you know the states not in disgrace but not not to fulfill the thing that he wants he got these he's got these Ranger groups together again and here's a here's a section where the Rangers are his some of his mages Rangers are going out they're on an operation I'm going to jump into the middle of this operation after a moment of intense argument Watson ordered back one of the Koreans they had left the radio Watson ordered back one of the Koreans Koreans to get the radio who not surprisingly refused until Watson threatened to beat the man himself scrambling to the clearing the Korean soldiers seize the radio by the back strap then dragged it behind him bouncing rolling smashing over rocks and leaving the trail of broken knobs handles and antenna bastards got his brains in his ass see the Watson as he watched when the runner reached the trees and present the radio everyone could see that it was destroyed with their only hope for survival buoyed upon the ability to communicate their position to the Navy's fighters and helicopters the radio's destruction meant Virginia that's the name of the team Virginia's was not far behind had Watson wanted to repay this cruelty and kind his rage was instantly short circuited by the shredding sound of a machine gun fire and the terror of communist soldiers lunging across the body strewn clearing without a word as Thornton recalled the Virginia survivors plunged into the trees and creed down the hill in a wild melee stumbling rising running and falling again hoping with every bruise to break through to the valley floor before the enemy since the news around their necks after running for what seemed like a half a mile the men collapse into the relative protection and shadow of a ravine as their lungs pump pump to miniature fog banks into the cold air their ears caught the growing but unmistakable home of hum and chop of two helicopters echoing through the valley when the first helicopter made it back to the clearing its pilot aged into a hover kicked out a bundle of supplies then leaned out as window coming face to face with a volley of muzzle flashes banking hard the pilot escaped and ambush the ambush only barely with the clearing obviously overrun both pilots roared their helicopters into an anxious racetrack search around the mountains flying so low that Thornton could easily make out each pilot's face without a radio even without even marking panels the Virginia survivors waved frantic arms but betrayed not a sound since any noise would only alert their hunters not the engine def in the pilots for 30 or so minutes the pilot searched then ascended and retrace their path through the ocean Virginia was alone except for the blowing wind and the rustle of the leafless trees remembered forten there was silence lonely empty silence they they go on the run you you highlight you you go through some of that and then finally fast forward a little bit on April 10th 10 hallucinatory days since the mountain top battle and just two to three miles from U.N. lines the last remaining members of Virginia mission were cornered in a cave captured and ransacked then beaten and bound with wire so tightly that Watson's arms soon swelled to twice their normal size for the second time in his life this veteran of the Darby's Rangers was a prisoner of war as fate would have it captured while escaping from a disaster as consequential for the Rangers as Sisturnah had been and this guy Watson you you you you introduce him later and you have to get the book to see what this guy's about but let me give you a little something so this guy gets captured in the 29 months since his capture, Corporal Martin R. Watson a soldier no guard or prisoner believed was actually a corporal had set an example for captivity that to this day was has never been exceeded 30 days after he was captured for 18 of which he had been starved in a cave to make his 240 pound size somewhat easier to handle Watson and a South Korean comrade had knocked out a guard with a rock and made for the surrounding mountains where they had survived for five days until their pursuers had disabled them by rolling or grenade into their hideout. yeah when you have you know what is clearly a naval commando force go anywhere commando force as capable as the Rangers were in 1942 this is a capability the army had they created it they were smart enough to create it and then they lost sight of the reasons that they created it and are actually the lose side of the reasons the the reasons that they created it are the reason that they had the downfall they didn't care about you know the Rangers commando capability there were more preoccupied with using the Rangers as a way to teach the rest of the army how to fight we want to integrate our Rangers with British commandos because the British commandos are really the only English speaking troops on the planet that knew how to fight they wanted to you know George Marshall wants to take that experience and pass it along to the rest of the US infantry or the army infantry and so by the time that the infantry starts to you know elevate itself to the the capabilities of the Rangers then divisional commander start using the Rangers more is not uh commandos to go you know radar uh on artillery position or command post they just start pushing them ahead of the infantry uh the homeless sort of like suicidal spearheaders and when you know the chapter ends highlight what's important and you've got to read it again and again and figure out you know what you can learn about him from the letter at the way talks the way it writes the way he thinks when you run into that when you can't you know squeeze any more information out of that then you're left with find in the family and you know in this case I found pedic words family I tried to find you know at least a family member for every you know person that I you know focused on on the book had dinner with buck Alprens son last night still close friends with him but pedicors family you know some of these people they don't realize like how important their dad or their grandfather was in the history and they have no idea why you're calling them yeah that I mean that that part alone I mean the fact that he doesn't even mention seals in that I mean clearly the navy thinks like I mean if there's not like a little you know you know that when the teacher you know pounds on the chalkboard says hey you might want to remember this for the test like that's what he's saying like hey don't you guys think that you want to be doing this mission and the army and the main person like Uh, the, uh, yeah, I couldn't have done this without lots of people helping out and including everybody that, you know, came together to, you know, get this album with Craven, um, you know, to, to get that, that blur from him and then, um, you know, I just couldn't have written it without just, uh, uh, uh, you know, the supportive, all the people around me, including the, the three little guys that I wrote this for. right but the child is ultimately going to be the one who decides what his future is going to be like and they you know all of this has come together into this last you know last two chapters like here we are uh and you know they they have trouble in the beginning they're almost sent home they all the seals almost completely missed the war anyway the you uh some so that the guys start coming back from those via nom deployments and like i said they start making adjustments because they're creeping more and more inland um i like this one When I get to the special forces like my thesis sort of like started to crumble and I had this moment of like panic where I was like, I mean the only thing I can do is just ignore the entire existence of the special forces because it's I mean it doesn't fit with what I've been doing for the past, you know, seven years and when I, you know, obviously it's not what I did, I think because it's not the right thing to do because you're telling a history you have to, you know, understand the relationship. And I, you know, that I, I couldn't find, you know, the letter, the document, uh, to, you know, suggest, you know, why he, um, was sort of turning his back on that and why he, you know, bought in so, you know, full heartedly to this idea of counter insurgency, but nevertheless it's there. I don't I don't have any of the original documents there's um left everything at the archive where it should be but if you need smuggle any out not saying that the temptation wasn't there because some of the archives that I you know went to you know they're uh some of their record keeping you know has a little bit to be desired and you want to protect you know this history you know uh but they still want to you know see what the navy can do so they send the survey team but the people that they select for the survey team are almost you know they're sort of they're waiting the scales a little bit I mean they send David Del Judas who is you know he's the commanding officer of the team one they send a filial killer who's a former UDT guy from the Pacific theater silver star winner and they sent full buckler was the second in command who is you know nobody has had a more inland naval experience outside of the sealed teams in this guy. That said I still was anxious for him to know you know the legacy and the contribution that he had you know not just to the seal teams but to you know establishing you know what ultimately the seal teams became the mission that the seal teams have. What he did know was how it happened, and I didn't have, like, you know, uh, in order to, you know, decide what a book's going to be, you've got to have, you know, not just an endpoint, you're going to have a beginning point. You know, we're going to turn these, you know, legions of, you know, third world, you know, people into, you know, our army of freedom. I mean quotes freaking Abraham Lincoln this report this guy's crafty for an unconventional example in a modified amphibious environment buckler could have drawn attention to his own legacy he didn't he never did so the humility Lincoln's fleet was example enough and practical terms his solution for the navy here to four failure was a comprehensive overhaul of the entire counter infiltration effort then you talk about this idea of counter infiltration as opposed to counter has opposed to counterinsurgs they want to keep the the infiltrators the the communists from pushing into south Vietnam it's a blockade I mean that's a traditional navy mission maybe doesn't understand counterinsurgency maybe there's much more comfortable with with a blockade right and and so therefore according therefore more navy boots more navy boarding teams more riverine checkpoints submarine nets navigation lights a system for checking cargo manifests and forcing and forcing curve views and exchange for all this more navy representation in four core planning on the question of whether the navy was missing the boat on counter insurgency the winning of the locals loyalty through civic action and leading the indigenous troops buckler's report was comparatively silent especially given the date just 86 days since Kennedy's assassination though he recommended increased boat supports two special forces camps he already judged the green berets efforts as slow in time consuming and therefore in effective fast forward a little bit in its 46 pages the report used the term counterinsurgency only two times or sorry only three times a somewhat nebulous field buckler would one day call it four fewer mentions than the term counter infiltration the reports preferred mission appearing at total of 10 times was a variant of the term rating a tactic that could said the report in gender more fight back spirit amongst the rag sailors though those were the south Vietnamese trained riverine sailors but would require companies of pursuit raiders preferably marines or rangers and who would accompany such and who would command such raids on this question the former scout radar turned sake ogorella did not blink the overwater transport of rating and landing forces should be a navy responsibility I mean he maybe has the worst world war to experience of anybody let me just jump into that real quick um a year later McGee was at the epicenter of history hopefully c Commanding Moro troops and the Philippines against Japanese bombers in the snake choked malaria hills around Del Monte field Del Monte Airfield at kilometer 117 of the Sair Highway becoming the only American of the 11 who fought to there to survive the war after six months of resistance on May 10th 1942 McGee swallid is pride obeyed his superior and with a humiliating blindfolded salute surrendered himself and as American and Filipino troops to an imperial Japanese officer wearing a kimono many of the Filipinos were tied to stakes shot and buried in pits the Japanese soldiers never bothering to confirm they were dead at 33 McGee's dark brown hair had already faded into an iron gray for the next 25 months McGee survived beatings trench foot dysentery malaria mosquitoes cages and slavery for nourishment he and his fellow prisoners were fed a meager died of rice and a few vegetables that occasionally included yams dog meat wafer thing candy bars and cigarettes the last two purchase with a monthly allotment of 40 pesos that the Japanese could turn into a lever to pry prisoners submission so sensitive to the men become to their hunger that when fearful of transfer they gorge themselves on every scrap they had hidden one man even devouring a litter of puppies born the same day along with his Catholic faith to which he cleaved McGee sustained his mind on a series of escape plans into the Philippine jungle even making use of a urinary track infection that kept him up at night to memorize the guide posts of the constellations to each plan was attached in obvious colorec colore obvious to him anyways once escaped he would raise and lead an army of Filipino gorillas against the Japanese for two years he plotted mentally choosing men for work details not for strength but for the knowledge and gunnerian logistics men around whom he could build the gorilla army in his mind on the night of June 12 two years one month and two days after his capture he finally got his chance while anchored off the east coast of Zambuanga peninsula on a prison transfer ship McGee pommed off his rose rebeats to a friend dropped every stitch of his ragged clothing to the deck then tiptoed over his sleeping comrades placed a naked foot on top of the railing and dove into the racing current through an initial volley of the through an initial volley of bullets and passed two other prison ships McGee drifted from miles until rescued by a native by a native in an outrigger who paddled him to land gave Matisha which McGee turned into a loincloth a sure two native boys eventually found fed and clothed and tied to undersigned sneakers to the bottom of his feet like heelless slippers then pushed and pulled his amaciated frame over jungle trails lit by nothing more than a torch as bright as a cigar tip and you go on from there I mean, I just knew that he was, you know, a guy that would, you know, take pity on all the people, uh, and, uh, so when everybody else was relaxing and kind of, uh, you know, licking their wounds from the previous week, I was at the pool of Master Chief Nepper. And I mean, little that I know that, you know, he was, uh, I mean, he's, you know, one of the oracles of, uh, seal history today. And again, it, it, it, you know, um, I've often said that, you know, when I got the teams, I don't know, when you got this still, so it was, there was no doctrine when you got the teams. We've all seen that sort of painting at P's where you've got the, you know, the naked warrior crawling out of the surf and then you've got this sort of Vietnam guy sort of crouched and, you know, wearing his, a tiger strike fatigues, you know, all, and next to the, the seal and Iraq Rafghanistan wearing the body arm and everything. I mean, he, you know, he, you know, he, you know, cached in everything he had, you know, to go do something that he believed in. Like how many people do you know, I don't know anybody like that today that would, you know, take away your house. That's sort of the beginning and there's something you know what's interesting I don't know I'm thinking if you do those like psychological games where or psychological tests where somebody says something and it makes you think of whatever you know you have to say what it means but when you hear amphibious commando who's not 100% in all that way. What, you know, we, you know, as a, as a, as a, as an institution have not done, which I think we should do at every opportunity is recognize the, uh, the influence of all of these other units had on our creation, you know, soldiers, Marines, Rangers, uh, recon, everybody. And, you know, he's, you know, he would be a nightmare to command, but, you know, also, you know, in Compton Blown Combat. I mean, they asked, you know, on the application, now I know, you know, you need, like, an admiral or somebody to write a letter, recommendation. And you know, his, you know, in coming Secretary of the Navy happens to be going as an extra ticket, you know, Mr. President Alec, would you like to go? So we've got attached to a, uh, you know, uh, uh, uh, uh, Marine, um, what was it, an LPD or LHA, something like that? right so here we go back to the book frustrated with the enemies retreat from the rung sats river banks debt golf had already started pushing further inland so far in fact that seal team ones replacement platoons were now anticipating almost nothing but helicopter insertions so we're we might not even be in the water at all not even next to a river to better prepare for this inland land warfare seal team ones Anderson had ordered guy stone a former Korean war soldier and forward observer who had left the army to be government-listed seal to create a six week long pre-deployment course in basic infantry tactics with a training camp carved into the chocolate mountains some 100 miles east of the Pacific Ocean stone had trained his team one comrades in every skill of soldiering that he knew everything from contour navigating to mortars every skill a step closer to navy infantrymen to the commanders now convened and coronado such development seemed to justify an official revision to the navies to the seals navy imposed operational boundaries in other words what deljudice anderson and early were describing as direct missions outside of a purely naval or maritime environment as they already knew there was only one other available area that could present a navy unit with that kind of opportunity an area contemporary a contemporary described as the wars true bastion of iron Uh, but so I'm, you know, paralleling the beaches were doing this and I know that, you know, the whole world is watching and at some point I got wrapped up in my led line. It's just, you know, you know, every character in this book, they have, you know, everybody wants to do something in the book, and most of them don't get to do the thing that they want. so he and and when he gets back home you know to finally meets the daughter that his wife meets he meets his daughter he was never met before and his reaction is immediately to volunteer for service back in the in the Pacific theater and the day he gets back the day he takes command of his troops they drop the drop the bomb and the entire time I mean that he's been you know neutralizes entire time facing the series of disbandments his little brother has been one of Marl's Marl's Marauders most effective of Italian commanders which is a really frustrating thing. So he attracts all of these, you know, pro football players to his program that they all want to, you know, serve their country, you know, in the most aggressive way possible and they find out that they're going to be calistening instructors. I mean you find something that is so you know what you think is meaningful or what you think you know sort of shows you the direction that this whole thing is going in you I mean the temptation is to really really focus on it and drag your reader through this So the seals didn't have this, you know, you might talk to an army green-braie, talking about, hey, I like my little people, you know, the, the side guys call them little people. crazy nine days later on February 25th 1964 the buckler report the name by which even McNamara would refer to it was officially distributed to leaders across the navy Matt V in the joint chiefs of staff eventually rising to the office of secretary defense it was handled said buckler like a hot potato actually was more like a gauntlet a challenge to the navy's leaders to not only directly fight an inland river war but to fight it in a way that mostly deviated from the consensus strategy of counter insurgency over the next two years this challenge would propel the navy toward the development of new vessels new organizations and most importantly new missions including the reports most recommended rating beyond the river banks so there it is from there the seal start creeping inland that's what starts happening and and here's the intro that i started this this podcast out with um debt one silting one debt golf billy making that's what's happening from there they start they start making adjustments to training And, you know, I don't want to leave the kid and all right, you know, at that time it was, you know, one kid had become two. So the, the legacy of those camps is, you know, uh, you know, understandably, you know, a feather in the Marine course cap. yeah for a commando unit but the idea was that you know these were the Navy's pirates you know the Rodgers or the Jolly Rodgers these guys are supposed to be the swaggering you know bushwackers the the Pacific. And, you know, his book a different kind of war is, you know, it's not, you know, some pillars was. What you got for us first off, first off, I'll side note, me and Ben have history, um, one of the first people that I met in San Diego and I moved to, you know, because of a connection between kick through, yep, through, uh, my Hawaii people, you know, that came to me to eventually become seals, he's well, first of all, he didn't remember you though. And if you read any like naval history book during like the Napoleonic Wars or if you read the Patrick O'Brien Master in Commander series, like you're never, you know, connect to your channel command. but you'd find stuff you'd find you know I found letters the pedic ordered written you've got to really you've got to look at the letter you've got to read it once you know Like, and the thing that like was, uh, I was blown away with, and I focused my, uh, attention of this chapter on Camp Six because Camp Six is really the only unit, uh, in Soko that is run by, uh, a member of naval special warfare. But it also, you know, revealed within, you know, three or four months that it wasn't the fact that the special forces was, you know, created committed action and disbanded. But with that thesis, by asking the question, how did the Navy come to create a land focus going to a work of a, I was able to stitch all these other, you know, Rangers and Raiders and all the other stories of, you know, the non-seal units into a book about the seals. It's not like I'd, you know, been in some sort of apprenticeship to, you know, go to law school or anything like that. You could, I thought about it and you would have to find you'd have to go through each of the reports and track down, you know, the, you know, the 150 guys and see who's still alive to see if they can put, you know, some chronology to it. Uh, I was wondering if there's anything you could do, you know, I'd really like to, you know, follow through on the socials packaging, come back to the teams as an officer. Um, you know, and at that point, you know, both, uh, uh, afghanistan and Iraq were going on. you see when you when you look through the structure of the institution that he had sort of created you see like like a siege a soda of like the comes tone in certain areas there like you can see and and every time that he constitutes this thing he the navy is a critical part of his ideas you can't do any of the types of things that he wants to do unless you have significant navy support navy transports So they have troops that are quasi you know commandos that are trained to do beach marking but you know at this point the war in 1945 when Soko has been created they realize that they can use these troops not just for beach marking anymore but for straight up command operations they have the Army's curriculum they have all the experience of working with army commandos He becomes the biggest, uh, disciple or a passallor, whatever you want to call him, of counter insurgency, of, you know, winning, uh, you know, the, the, the, the hearts and minds of the people, and then turning them or at least denying them to the enemy. so you're trying to learn about them and such a way that you can find out the traits in that person that made them consequential and whether the traits that made you know somebody like Carlson, a failure or the traits that made pedicure to buckler or hauntburn success so oftentimes you'd hit a wall there's no place you know there's no more information that's available and existing literature But I mean, he's every bit is consequential, at least as far as the Navy's journey from, you know, the ocean to the land, as, you know, say somebody like Lawrence of Arabia. But like I said, writing the book creates, you know, present structuring and research challenges, you know, every chapter is hard to write. So the leaders of the Marine Corps who all fought on the battlefield, the first World War, they feel like when World War II happens, uh, they can finally, uh, achieve the status that their service has long, uh, uh, uh, deserved. You'd be like, yes, there's a book here clearly, but we're, you know, we're going on to, you know, the subject. And he, you know, points, you know, obviously behind me and he goes, do you know that woman, I turn around. I mean you mean there's so many times if you're writing history that, you know, the temptation is there you want to, you know, make the facts fit your narrative. How do they, you know, how do they just, you know, structure or how do they, you know, we've multiple storylines together. And then by the end of the race, uh, you know, you're, you're, uh, physically taxed, but you can, you know, gut through the, the last bit of pain. I mean, there's, you know, when you think of there's 30 or 40,000 Japanese on these islands, when most of these islands somewhere around that number, you know, if you have an extra million soldiers to throw into that mix, as was true of every successful general in history, Miles success had come at the price of his sleep, his health, his family's happiness, and even his sanity. Uh, yeah, I had to, uh, um, I, I expected that, uh, swimming would, would be just like it was, uh, like, running was for me. but he was you know he'd start talking about being out there at the desert training facility and like they set up the point man course when they put booby traps and targets and all that like that's what i did when i got silting one you went out there I mean, like I said, I mean, we got our history, not just from, you know, frog men. She's like, I know there's more material out there and I've got to get it into the book and I mean, short of going down to Miami and meeting with the actual, or because I closely using it and they close the bad big news amp, but I managed to find them and their accounts are in there. Uh, so when the Navy says, they want to, uh, spread the Japanese, uh, attention away from the Solomon's or away from the South Pacific and do this raid, Marine Corps thinks well, it's, you know, it's not really what we should be doing, but we'll do it just because the Navy wants it. Like everybody, I mean, you can, so I knew that if I did that, then the history that I was going to write was going to be like every other history that I've been written on the teams sort of just wave tops. In fact you don't want to be, he just I mean he's he sort of continues to do the thing that he doesn't really want to do because that's the right thing that he you know it's the thing that's going to accomplish the mission that he's been given which is to demolish Hitler's Atlantic wall. He had to write the report because the original commander got sent home and the reason the original commander of the the commission or the survey team we don't know if he was sent home for a health problem or as one person said for a closet drunkenness but they I mean the the the point of this report that there's sent to to create is to figure out what the hell the navy's supposed to do in Vietnam. But this book spells it out so much more and the book details the entire history of the seal teams from the scouts and raiders to the naval combat demolition units to the underwater demolition teams up to what we now know and where I served my adult life in the seal teams. They're, they're, they're, they're interested in being their own branch of service completely, uh, uh, uh, uh, you know, subservient to themselves. i mean they created the seal teams but they haven't determined what the seal teams are going to be they've raised them like a parent was going to raise a child they like planted a seed Yeah, I've said it, you know, time and time again, like, pound for pound, there is no institution like the US Marine Corps. Maybe a mission would go bad or a war would end or a combination of those two things, or you know, when you're in the Army and you're a general, when you got some cowboy looking guy running around, and you're senior to that cowboy looking guy, you think I don't want this guy running around? the radio man for seven a and they had problems of their own at a little before three a m Peterson and squad seven a consider themselves in a very difficult position everywhere they looked in the surrounding tree line there was movement at one point Peterson had even seen torches what seemed like hundreds of them moving toward their south but as they were now finding out over the radio it could have been even worse once galager and seven bees situation was learned Peterson was quick to count his blessing first he had none of galager's casualties except for the lyrp who had shot the man Peterson had meant to interrogate every one of his men still had a full load of load out of ammunition next was his position clear field of fire and every direction and the cemetery's berm for cover even concrete vaults if the enemy brought in his mortars most important of all roul's radio was now working as it should putting the squad in reach of army slicks and navy sea wolves who were at that moment on their way to seven a's wreck rescue or at least they had been.
