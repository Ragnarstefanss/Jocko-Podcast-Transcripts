00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.28 This is Jockel Podcast number 31, with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:11.28 --> 00:00:18.48 Bernardo Simpson watched three men, including Huto and Hudson, going to a hut with a girl
00:00:18.48 --> 00:00:21.40 aged about 17.
00:00:21.40 --> 00:00:27.88 Her trousers were forcibly removed, the girl was held down while she was violated.
00:00:27.88 --> 00:00:30.76 Simpson observed this from the door.
00:00:30.76 --> 00:00:35.52 Fagan was also part of the girl's ordeal.
00:00:35.52 --> 00:00:41.16 When they were finished, the helpless captive were shot dead.
00:00:41.16 --> 00:00:44.52 Her face completely blown away.
00:00:44.52 --> 00:00:51.80 Tora stabbed several people with a bowie knife and was seen by Huto raping a girl.
00:00:51.80 --> 00:00:56.52 She was crying, fighting, and resisting him.
00:00:56.52 --> 00:01:00.96 The other soldier held her down.
00:01:00.96 --> 00:01:06.20 For Simpson, the crucial moment was when he shot the woman and baby soon after entering
00:01:06.20 --> 00:01:09.36 the village.
00:01:09.36 --> 00:01:15.04 I went to turn her over and there was a little baby with her that I had also killed.
00:01:15.04 --> 00:01:18.52 The baby's face was half gone.
00:01:18.52 --> 00:01:20.80 My mind just went.
00:01:20.80 --> 00:01:24.28 The training came to me and I just started killing.
00:01:24.28 --> 00:01:31.24 Old men, women, children, water buffaloes, everything.
00:01:31.24 --> 00:01:34.20 We were told to leave nothing standing.
00:01:34.20 --> 00:01:35.84 We did what we were told.
00:01:35.84 --> 00:01:38.76 We guardless of whether they were civilians.
00:01:38.76 --> 00:01:43.76 They was the enemy, period, kill.
00:01:43.76 --> 00:01:49.52 If you don't follow a director or you can be shot yourself, now what am I supposed to do?
00:01:49.52 --> 00:01:53.88 You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.
00:01:53.88 --> 00:01:56.12 You didn't have to look for people to kill.
00:01:56.12 --> 00:01:59.12 They were just there.
00:01:59.12 --> 00:02:05.04 I cut their throats, cut off their hands, cut out their tongue, their hair, scalp them.
00:02:05.04 --> 00:02:07.24 I did it.
00:02:07.24 --> 00:02:09.84 A lot of people were doing it and I just followed.
00:02:09.84 --> 00:02:13.04 I just lost all sense of direction.
00:02:13.04 --> 00:02:16.68 I just started killing any kind of way I can kill.
00:02:16.68 --> 00:02:18.44 It just came.
00:02:18.44 --> 00:02:20.000 I didn't know I had it in me.
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.04 After I killed the child, my whole mind just went.
00:02:25.04 --> 00:02:27.72 It just went.
00:02:27.72 --> 00:02:31.28 And after you start, it's very easy to keep on.
00:02:31.28 --> 00:02:35.16 The hardest is to kill the first time, but once you kill, then it becomes easier to kill
00:02:35.16 --> 00:02:38.64 the next person and the next one and the next one.
00:02:38.64 --> 00:02:43.24 Because I had no feelings, no emotion, nothing.
00:02:43.24 --> 00:02:45.52 I just killed.
00:02:45.52 --> 00:02:47.08 I wasn't the only one that did it.
00:02:47.08 --> 00:02:48.88 A lot of people in the company did it.
00:02:48.88 --> 00:02:50.60 I hung them up all types of ways.
00:02:50.60 --> 00:02:54.76 Any type of way that you could kill someone, that's what they did.
00:02:54.76 --> 00:03:02.32 That day in Mealai, I was personally responsible for killing about 25 people personally.
00:03:02.32 --> 00:03:06.64 I don't think beforehand, anyone thought we would kill so many people.
00:03:06.64 --> 00:03:10.20 I mean, we're talking about 4 to 500 people.
00:03:10.20 --> 00:03:14.80 We almost wiped out the whole village, a whole community.
00:03:14.80 --> 00:03:19.36 I can't forget the magnitude of the number of people that we killed and how they were killed
00:03:19.36 --> 00:03:22.88 killed in lots of ways.
00:03:22.88 --> 00:03:28.52 Do you realize what it's like killing 500 people in a matter of 4 or 5 hours?
00:03:28.52 --> 00:03:31.92 It's just like the gas chambers, what Hitler did.
00:03:31.92 --> 00:03:38.48 You line up 50 people, women, old men, children, and just mow them down.
00:03:38.48 --> 00:03:40.84 And that's the way it was.
00:03:40.84 --> 00:03:44.64 We were 25 to 50 to 100, just killed.
00:03:44.64 --> 00:03:50.08 We rounded them up, me and a couple of guys just put the M16 on automatic and just mowed
00:03:50.08 --> 00:03:59.76 them down.
00:03:59.76 --> 00:04:01.76 Good evening, Echo.
00:04:01.76 --> 00:04:04.56 Good evening.
00:04:04.56 --> 00:04:15.74 Well, that was an excerpt from a book called Four Hours in Mealai by Michael
00:04:15.74 --> 00:04:20.88 Building and Kevin Sim.
00:04:20.88 --> 00:04:27.16 And when I was prepping for this, I mentioned to a couple of people that I was going
00:04:27.16 --> 00:04:31.60 to do Mealai on the podcast next.
00:04:31.60 --> 00:04:35.84 And surprisingly, a lot of people didn't know what it was.
00:04:35.84 --> 00:04:41.72 And I thought everybody knew about Mealai.
00:04:41.72 --> 00:04:45.20 Mealai is a war crime.
00:04:45.20 --> 00:04:48.84 It's an atrocity.
00:04:48.84 --> 00:04:54.64 And what makes it so hard to talk about is that it was an atrocity and a war crime that
00:04:54.64 --> 00:05:00.84 was committed by American soldiers.
00:05:00.84 --> 00:05:07.84 Now, of course, there's people out there that like to claim that America is this evil and
00:05:07.84 --> 00:05:16.28 periodic empire, which I am telling you, it is not by any stretch.
00:05:16.28 --> 00:05:26.96 America isn't an incredibly benevolent nation with a conscience and a soul that, as a whole,
00:05:26.96 --> 00:05:28.92 is good.
00:05:28.92 --> 00:05:32.52 And have we done some things in the past that don't reflect that?
00:05:32.52 --> 00:05:33.96 We absolutely have.
00:05:33.96 --> 00:05:36.80 But for the most part, we have stood up for the week.
00:05:36.80 --> 00:05:38.36 We have liberated the oppressed.
00:05:38.36 --> 00:05:39.52 We defeated the Nazis.
00:05:39.52 --> 00:05:42.20 We defeated the imperial Japanese army.
00:05:42.20 --> 00:05:47.88 We give aid and military assistance and education and money to less fortunate people all
00:05:47.88 --> 00:05:51.96 over the world all the time.
00:05:51.96 --> 00:06:07.64 We are a good nation filled with, for the most part, good people, but not all good people.
00:06:07.64 --> 00:06:19.96 And people inside of people, inside of humans, there can be something very dark.
00:06:19.96 --> 00:06:30.40 And sometimes that darkness can override the light.
00:06:30.40 --> 00:06:40.48 And that is exactly what happened in a small village in Vietnam called Me Lie on March 16th,
00:06:40.48 --> 00:06:55.20 1668, that 0715 in the morning, a massacre in atrocity.
00:06:55.20 --> 00:07:06.28 The murder of hundreds and hundreds of old men, women and children unarmed begging for mercy.
00:07:06.28 --> 00:07:21.72 Not stabbed, blown up, raped, tortured, killed, murdered.
00:07:21.72 --> 00:07:31.08 And no, I don't like talking about this, especially when it's Americans that are committing
00:07:31.08 --> 00:07:34.52 this sin.
00:07:34.52 --> 00:07:39.56 And we talk about the Nazis in Germany and we talk about the Cheshins in Grasini and we
00:07:39.56 --> 00:07:45.56 talk about the Japanese in the Malaysian jungle and the Houtusian Rwanda.
00:07:45.56 --> 00:07:56.20 I don't like that, but this is us.
00:07:56.20 --> 00:08:01.16 And so the question comes, it came into my mind.
00:08:01.16 --> 00:08:02.16 Do I do this?
00:08:02.16 --> 00:08:05.28 Do I talk about this?
00:08:05.28 --> 00:08:07.04 Can I talk about this?
00:08:07.04 --> 00:08:11.72 And the bottom line is not can I.
00:08:11.72 --> 00:08:14.24 But we have to, we have to cover this.
00:08:14.24 --> 00:08:15.68 We have to talk about it.
00:08:15.68 --> 00:08:16.96 We can't ignore it.
00:08:16.96 --> 00:08:17.96 We can't deny it.
00:08:17.96 --> 00:08:21.56 We have to take ownership of it.
00:08:21.56 --> 00:08:32.12 To admit it, to air it out and to keep it in the front of our minds to ensure that we do everything
00:08:32.12 --> 00:08:44.80 we can to make sure nothing like this ever happens again.
00:08:44.80 --> 00:08:48.64 War is hell.
00:08:48.64 --> 00:08:59.84 And me lie is the ninth circle of hell, the worst part.
00:08:59.84 --> 00:09:05.24 And let's go there to make sure we remember.
00:09:05.24 --> 00:09:13.56 And start by looking at the path that led there.
00:09:13.56 --> 00:09:17.72 And in order to look at the path that led there, we're going to start just by a little
00:09:17.72 --> 00:09:20.80 bit of broad strategy.
00:09:20.80 --> 00:09:24.80 Because there's plenty of blame to go around.
00:09:24.80 --> 00:09:29.76 And when you look at the broad strategy in the way it was laid out, here's a little
00:09:29.76 --> 00:09:34.000 piece on General Westmoreland who was running the strategy in Vietnam.
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.80 General Westmoreland's strategy of attrition also had an important effect on our behavior.
00:09:40.80 --> 00:09:47.40 Our mission was not to win terrain or seize positions, but simply to kill.
00:09:47.40 --> 00:09:53.28 To kill Communists and kill as many of them as possible, stack them up like cordwood.
00:09:53.28 --> 00:09:56.000 Victory was a high body count.
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.80 The feet, a low kill ratio, wore a matter of arithmetic.
00:10:02.80 --> 00:10:07.64 The pressure on unit commanders to produce as many corpses was intense and they in turn
00:10:07.64 --> 00:10:10.40 communicated it to their troops.
00:10:10.40 --> 00:10:15.92 It's not surprising, therefore, that some men acquired a contempt for human life and a
00:10:15.92 --> 00:10:20.000 predilection for taking it.
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.12 So that's the environment that you're in.
00:10:24.12 --> 00:10:28.36 The environment that's being encouraged to kill.
00:10:28.36 --> 00:10:31.16 Kill as many as possible.
00:10:31.16 --> 00:10:32.36 That's coming from the top.
00:10:32.36 --> 00:10:34.76 That's the broad strategy.
00:10:34.76 --> 00:10:36.08 Not to win this hill.
00:10:36.08 --> 00:10:39.96 It's a kill.
00:10:39.96 --> 00:10:41.92 And who are you talking to and who's receiving this?
00:10:41.92 --> 00:10:48.16 Here's a little piece on Charlie Company, which is the Army Unit that this is based
00:10:48.16 --> 00:10:51.44 on and that committed this atrocity.
00:10:51.44 --> 00:10:54.88 We were kids, 18, 19 years old.
00:10:54.88 --> 00:10:56.88 I was 21 years old at the time.
00:10:56.88 --> 00:11:01.28 I was one of the oldest people around there among the common grunts.
00:11:01.28 --> 00:11:05.04 Most of them had never been away from home before they went to service and they end up
00:11:05.04 --> 00:11:06.04 in Vietnam.
00:11:06.04 --> 00:11:09.24 Many of them because they thought they were going to do something courageous on behalf
00:11:09.24 --> 00:11:12.92 of their country.
00:11:12.92 --> 00:11:15.36 So young kids.
00:11:15.36 --> 00:11:21.60 And nowadays, if you're young kid, you're 13, 14, 16, 18, you know, guess what?
00:11:21.60 --> 00:11:25.12 You might not have traveled around the world, but you've seen the world because you
00:11:25.12 --> 00:11:26.12 have television.
00:11:26.12 --> 00:11:27.32 You have the internet.
00:11:27.32 --> 00:11:29.04 You can see all these parts of the world.
00:11:29.04 --> 00:11:31.04 You can see all different cultures and people.
00:11:31.04 --> 00:11:38.72 Well, when you're from Iowa in 1967, you don't know anything about this.
00:11:38.72 --> 00:11:44.000 So you're getting next thing, you know, six months later, you're in Vietnam.
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.32 And here is a little bit of where you're going to get your attitude from.
00:11:50.32 --> 00:11:55.52 Back to the book, to the troops of Charlie Company, to American troops in general, all
00:11:55.52 --> 00:12:00.48 Vietnamese were Gooks, Dinks, Dopes, and Slopes.
00:12:00.48 --> 00:12:04.80 So just you could not find the Vietnamese who were their enemy soon struck out wildly
00:12:04.80 --> 00:12:08.84 at the Vietnamese who were supposed to be their friends.
00:12:08.84 --> 00:12:13.92 How can you tell the enemy, Varnoto Simpson, said, they all look the same.
00:12:13.92 --> 00:12:21.44 Which another MII veteran added, in the end, everyone in that country was the enemy.
00:12:21.44 --> 00:12:25.28 In all wars, it is common for the enemy to be dehumanized.
00:12:25.28 --> 00:12:30.92 But in Vietnam, American soldiers also dehumanized their allies.
00:12:30.92 --> 00:12:36.32 Charlie Company had not been in Vietnam long before the pattern of brutality leading to
00:12:36.32 --> 00:12:38.16 me lie began.
00:12:38.16 --> 00:12:42.24 Their own losses and injuries hastened the process.
00:12:42.24 --> 00:12:50.000 Retrid, fear, racism, and revenge turned to beatings torture, rape, murder.
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.16 All these offenses were committed with impunity by individuals and groups from Charlie
00:12:54.16 --> 00:12:57.48 Company in the weeks before the massacre.
00:12:57.48 --> 00:13:05.88 Finally, at MII, they discovered that having dehumanized the Vietnamese, they had also dehumanized
00:13:05.88 --> 00:13:09.88 themselves.
00:13:09.88 --> 00:13:12.28 So you're going to see this escalation.
00:13:12.28 --> 00:13:19.000 And it's just like we talked about with the Russian soldiers in Chechnya and how it starts
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.68 when they don't shave.
00:13:20.68 --> 00:13:23.12 And then they don't clean their weapon and then they don't stand watching and then the
00:13:23.12 --> 00:13:26.28 next thing they're not doing, they're doing their duty and they're being overrun.
00:13:26.28 --> 00:13:32.68 You're going to see a similar escalation here around the lack of discipline, but it's
00:13:32.68 --> 00:13:36.88 in the way that they treat the local populace.
00:13:36.88 --> 00:13:44.20 And you know, I had one of my high school teachers was a Vietnam veteran and when I was
00:13:44.20 --> 00:13:49.64 going to high school, the movie Platoon came out.
00:13:49.64 --> 00:13:53.60 And you can tell, actually, you can tell that the movie Platoon, the book we did,
00:13:53.60 --> 00:13:58.76 Platoon leader by Jim McDonald, there's so many scenes in that book that you can tell all
00:13:58.76 --> 00:14:01.32 of them are read that book and put some of those scenes in the movie.
00:14:01.32 --> 00:14:02.32 There's no doubt about it.
00:14:02.32 --> 00:14:08.20 There's even a character named Barnes in the book and in the movie.
00:14:08.20 --> 00:14:16.48 Well Platoon also showed, you know, a very, it portrayed the Americans in a very rough
00:14:16.48 --> 00:14:19.44 light in many of the situations.
00:14:19.44 --> 00:14:24.64 And when I talked to my one of my teachers in high school that was a Vietnam vet, and
00:14:24.64 --> 00:14:28.12 he just said, you know, the thing that they didn't show very well, because they show
00:14:28.12 --> 00:14:35.72 the guys coming in and really be people, killing people, burning villages.
00:14:35.72 --> 00:14:41.64 And what he said was, you know, Jaka, we would walk around a village and one of our guys
00:14:41.64 --> 00:14:45.16 would hit a booby trap every day, every other day.
00:14:45.16 --> 00:14:49.72 And the villagers are out there walking on the same trails, but they're not getting blown
00:14:49.72 --> 00:14:50.72 up.
00:14:50.72 --> 00:14:57.92 And so after weeks and then months of this happening of me losing two guys, three guys,
00:14:57.92 --> 00:15:02.92 six guys getting blown up, getting killed, losing their legs, losing their arms, losing their
00:15:02.92 --> 00:15:07.72 lives, and the Vietnamese villagers, they're not hitting anything.
00:15:07.72 --> 00:15:13.24 Eventually in in our minds, they become guilty.
00:15:13.24 --> 00:15:21.40 Now when you have leadership that can explain and restrain and control, you can keep that
00:15:21.40 --> 00:15:24.68 stuff controlled.
00:15:24.68 --> 00:15:28.92 But when you have leadership that buys into that attitude, you end up in a very bad
00:15:28.92 --> 00:15:36.56 situation, which is where we're heading here in Mely.
00:15:36.56 --> 00:15:38.84 Now back to the strategy.
00:15:38.84 --> 00:15:43.04 The aim of American strategy was simple to kill via Kong and such large numbers that they
00:15:43.04 --> 00:15:46.48 would not be replaced, or could not be replaced.
00:15:46.48 --> 00:15:52.36 But how was this to be achieved without, at the same time, killing large numbers of civilians?
00:15:52.36 --> 00:15:58.96 This was a problem to which no one on the American side ever discovered a satisfactory answer.
00:15:58.96 --> 00:16:00.92 It was the biggest failure of the war.
00:16:00.92 --> 00:16:06.24 It was a failure magnified enormously by American strategic thinking.
00:16:06.24 --> 00:16:11.40 The Westmoreland Vietnam was a war of attrition, a meat grinder, as they called it in the
00:16:11.40 --> 00:16:13.000 Pentagon.
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.76 The object he explained was to bleed the north to waken in the communist mind, the notion
00:16:17.76 --> 00:16:23.12 that they were draining their population, to the point of national disaster for generations
00:16:23.12 --> 00:16:24.92 to come.
00:16:24.92 --> 00:16:30.48 To achieve this goal and to win a war of attrition, Americans had to kill via Kong fighters
00:16:30.48 --> 00:16:33.32 faster than the communist could replace them.
00:16:33.32 --> 00:16:39.56 As Bifit's a great industrial power, the war was to be fought on an industrial scale.
00:16:39.56 --> 00:16:44.44 Westmoreland like Patton before him intended to construct a killing machine so formidable
00:16:44.44 --> 00:16:47.16 as to be irresistible.
00:16:47.16 --> 00:16:53.88 It sheer size and power would pulverize the enemy in this submission.
00:16:53.88 --> 00:16:55.52 So there you go.
00:16:55.52 --> 00:17:00.24 Once again, it's very clear what the goal was from a strategic level.
00:17:00.24 --> 00:17:09.000 And this kind of spells out how determined they were to do that.
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000 Back to the book.
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.40 From the beginning of American involvement, it would become common practice for patrols
00:17:14.40 --> 00:17:19.52 to call for artillery or an air strike if they received even sniper fire from a village.
00:17:19.52 --> 00:17:23.36 Irrespective of whether civilians also sheltered there.
00:17:23.36 --> 00:17:30.72 By the end of 1966, fighter bombers were making up to 400 such shorties a day.
00:17:30.72 --> 00:17:37.84 Added to B-52 raids in the country, this meant that around 825 tons of bombs were delivered
00:17:37.84 --> 00:17:39.84 every day.
00:17:39.84 --> 00:17:46.08 A figure that doubled by the tonnage of high explosive fired off by artillery.
00:17:46.08 --> 00:17:53.04 The solution in Vietnam, General Dupri, told the visiting amissary from the Pentagon,
00:17:53.04 --> 00:17:59.84 is more bombs more shells more napaum, till the other side cracks and gives up.
00:17:59.84 --> 00:18:01.24 And that's what they got.
00:18:01.24 --> 00:18:06.000 In 1967, an article in Life Magazine claimed that the cost of killing a single vehicle
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:13.72 in Gorilla was $400,000, which included the cost of 75 bombs and 150 artillery shells.
00:18:13.72 --> 00:18:19.48 No nation in history had waged a war with such little regard to expense.
00:18:19.48 --> 00:18:26.04 Only days before Mely, Robert McNamara, the retiring secretary of defense, would remind
00:18:26.04 --> 00:18:30.08 an audience gathered to record his farewell from the Pentagon that more bombs had been dropped
00:18:30.08 --> 00:18:39.32 on Vietnam than on the whole of Europe during the whole of World War II.
00:18:39.32 --> 00:18:41.32 So that's crazy.
00:18:41.32 --> 00:18:47.24 Especially for me, from my perspective, having been in the war in Iraq and having known
00:18:47.24 --> 00:18:54.48 guys that fought NAF Afghanistan, this idea that they take sniper fire from a village and
00:18:54.48 --> 00:18:58.28 then call in the air strikes on the village is just something that would not happen.
00:18:58.28 --> 00:19:06.60 Then that's why when people frame America as being this power that just goes and crushes
00:19:06.60 --> 00:19:10.16 and kills all these civilians, I know for a fact it's not true.
00:19:10.16 --> 00:19:15.000 Yes, obviously it happened in Vietnam, but we go through great lengths.
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.20 There were some times I'm telling you, almost sometimes absurd lengths to protect the civilian
00:19:20.20 --> 00:19:22.24 populace in Iraq in Afghanistan.
00:19:22.24 --> 00:19:27.64 I could bring so many people on here on this program, just seals.
00:19:27.64 --> 00:19:31.48 But I could bring anybody from all kinds of every branch of the military to come here
00:19:31.48 --> 00:19:33.92 and say, oh yeah, here's a situation.
00:19:33.92 --> 00:19:35.28 My guys were pinned down under fire.
00:19:35.28 --> 00:19:37.08 We tried to get bombs dropped on this building.
00:19:37.08 --> 00:19:38.08 No one would do it.
00:19:38.08 --> 00:19:39.08 We couldn't do it.
00:19:39.08 --> 00:19:40.08 We weren't allowed to do it.
00:19:40.08 --> 00:19:43.80 And that's the reality today.
00:19:43.80 --> 00:19:48.56 And part of that is we've matured as a nation, obviously we see that that's a problem.
00:19:48.56 --> 00:19:51.52 I mean, this is the way we should fight.
00:19:51.52 --> 00:19:53.44 Sometimes we go too far in one direction.
00:19:53.44 --> 00:20:00.000 This was obviously too far in the other direction.
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.92 In Iraq, I remember you mentioned something about the enemy in Iraq.
00:20:07.92 --> 00:20:09.56 Would you use the civilian populace?
00:20:09.56 --> 00:20:11.12 Oh, there's no doubt about it.
00:20:11.12 --> 00:20:15.60 They're like, they literally used kids as shields.
00:20:15.60 --> 00:20:18.24 They knew our rules of engagement.
00:20:18.24 --> 00:20:22.68 They knew that if they stayed in buildings that were close to a mosque or were close to a
00:20:22.68 --> 00:20:26.60 hospital that we wouldn't bomb it, that we wouldn't hit it with armor.
00:20:26.60 --> 00:20:32.24 So they were very smart about how they took advantage of our rules of engagement.
00:20:32.24 --> 00:20:34.32 And then we had to adjust our tactics.
00:20:34.32 --> 00:20:36.12 So there's no doubt.
00:20:36.12 --> 00:20:39.88 The enemy figures out what your rules of engagement are and then they start to press
00:20:39.88 --> 00:20:43.84 you in the seams of that rules of engagement, to try and take advantage of it, to the best
00:20:43.84 --> 00:20:44.84 their ability.
00:20:44.84 --> 00:20:51.60 Do you think that that's kind of an indicator that they cared about their civilians less
00:20:51.60 --> 00:20:53.80 than you cared about their civilians?
00:20:53.80 --> 00:20:55.52 That is 100% accurate.
00:20:55.52 --> 00:20:56.52 Of course.
00:20:56.52 --> 00:21:03.20 I mean, the al Qaeda insurgents and now the ISIS in Iraq, they don't care about civilian casualties.
00:21:03.20 --> 00:21:05.08 And all, they don't care.
00:21:05.08 --> 00:21:06.08 They literally don't care.
00:21:06.08 --> 00:21:07.08 Their own civilian.
00:21:07.08 --> 00:21:08.08 Their own civilian.
00:21:08.08 --> 00:21:09.08 That's crazy.
00:21:09.08 --> 00:21:13.04 The civilians, again, this is something I never gets portrayed correctly.
00:21:13.04 --> 00:21:15.52 The civilians don't want ISIS in charge.
00:21:15.52 --> 00:21:17.88 The civilians didn't want al Qaeda in charge.
00:21:17.88 --> 00:21:21.32 They knew what that would lead to.
00:21:21.32 --> 00:21:25.48 And yeah, al Qaeda would use their children as shields.
00:21:25.48 --> 00:21:33.000 I mean, I literally had snipers of mine that shot al Qaeda guys carrying machine guns in
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.56 one hand and a baby in the other hand.
00:21:36.56 --> 00:21:41.60 And luckily, we had really good snipers.
00:21:41.60 --> 00:21:49.68 So back to the book here, we get to talk a little bit about the company, the company
00:21:49.68 --> 00:21:52.44 that this is about Charlie Company.
00:21:52.44 --> 00:21:57.92 And a company is the company soldiers generally around 150 people.
00:21:57.92 --> 00:22:02.000 And you'll have three, generally you'll have three platoons in there.
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.88 So your platoons are going to be 40, 50, maybe 60 people.
00:22:04.88 --> 00:22:07.40 Sometimes it's actually a lot more flexible than people realize.
00:22:07.40 --> 00:22:10.28 Sometimes an army company will have five platoons.
00:22:10.28 --> 00:22:13.16 But generally three platoons, what they'll have.
00:22:13.16 --> 00:22:16.56 So we're talking here, probably about 150 guys in Charlie Company.
00:22:16.56 --> 00:22:22.48 And they're guys, they lay out that kind of going to a quick background of the different
00:22:22.48 --> 00:22:23.48 guys.
00:22:23.48 --> 00:22:28.88 And really what an end up showing you is a cross section of America.
00:22:28.88 --> 00:22:34.64 Some highlights, they got a guy named Fred Widmer from North of Pittsburgh.
00:22:34.64 --> 00:22:40.44 He got a guy named Kenneth Hodges from Dublin, Georgia, a farmer's boy.
00:22:40.44 --> 00:22:47.96 You got a guy from Portland, Oregon named Greg Olson, who's a Mormon, a devout Mormon.
00:22:47.96 --> 00:22:55.32 And from a good family, you got another guy named Harry Stanley from Gulfport, Mississippi,
00:22:55.32 --> 00:23:01.56 who was brought up by his mom, who believed in hard work, school, and church on Sundays.
00:23:01.56 --> 00:23:06.60 So you're looking at a fairly normal cross section, Michael Burnhart, came from a middle
00:23:06.60 --> 00:23:09.40 class Catholic family from Long Island.
00:23:09.40 --> 00:23:13.88 So you got just the troops, just a cross section.
00:23:13.88 --> 00:23:22.80 And then you get to one of the leaders in Charlie Company, in charge of Second Platoon.
00:23:22.80 --> 00:23:30.96 And his name was William Laws Callie, Lieutenant Callie.
00:23:30.96 --> 00:23:36.72 And he's going to end up being our the monster here.
00:23:36.72 --> 00:23:39.68 So back to the book, who was Callie?
00:23:39.68 --> 00:23:44.28 In the early 70s, a small industry grew up trying to find the answer.
00:23:44.28 --> 00:23:49.28 Toilers at this trade looked for a monster, but all they found was a non entity.
00:23:49.28 --> 00:23:55.52 A bland young man burdened it seemed with his much ordinaryness as any single individual
00:23:55.52 --> 00:23:56.52 could bear.
00:23:56.52 --> 00:24:01.40 And almost too much of a conventional and common place to retain what is necessary for
00:24:01.40 --> 00:24:04.52 human identity.
00:24:04.52 --> 00:24:10.40 To press Callie to the press, Callie was just about as average in American as ever came
00:24:10.40 --> 00:24:14.20 out of the non-discripped middle class streets of Miami.
00:24:14.20 --> 00:24:16.76 He could be any young American.
00:24:16.76 --> 00:24:18.68 He was the quiet American.
00:24:18.68 --> 00:24:23.60 It was noted with astonishment that he emerged from a background which most would regard
00:24:23.60 --> 00:24:27.48 as coming close to the American ideal.
00:24:27.48 --> 00:24:31.84 Elsewhere it was said that his life could have been lifted from the cover drawing of the
00:24:31.84 --> 00:24:34.40 old Saturday evening post.
00:24:34.40 --> 00:24:39.80 His averageness had made him so invisible at one college he attended that all anyone could
00:24:39.80 --> 00:24:45.24 remember about him was that he paid his rent regularly.
00:24:45.24 --> 00:24:49.32 The many who combed through his life found no shred of deviance.
00:24:49.32 --> 00:24:56.56 And even a single distinctive feature other than his height, 5-4, 5 feet forages.
00:24:56.56 --> 00:24:58.16 He'd come from a stable family.
00:24:58.16 --> 00:25:01.28 He'd been neither particularly popular or unpopular.
00:25:01.28 --> 00:25:05.96 He had no particular talents and few if any enthusiasm.
00:25:05.96 --> 00:25:11.08 Water skiing was the closest he ever got to violence.
00:25:11.08 --> 00:25:16.44 Throughout a long education, he'd shown no aptitude for learning his college career
00:25:16.44 --> 00:25:21.92 simply fizzled out.
00:25:21.92 --> 00:25:22.92 That's one of the things.
00:25:22.92 --> 00:25:28.92 You can see this guy is white bread, plain plain.
00:25:28.92 --> 00:25:33.36 That's what they find about him.
00:25:33.36 --> 00:25:39.84 The company itself, they say back to the book Charlie Company was very average.
00:25:39.84 --> 00:25:44.20 Charlie Company actually reflects Kelly in the fact that Charlie Company as a whole is pretty
00:25:44.20 --> 00:25:47.72 normal for a company of army soldiers in Vietnam.
00:25:47.72 --> 00:25:53.32 An investigation ordered by the Army Chief of Staff in 1970 revealed that 87% of Charlie
00:25:53.32 --> 00:25:58.52 companies and CEOs were high school graduates nearly 20% above the Army's norm.
00:25:58.52 --> 00:26:01.96 Most of the men in Charlie Company were between 18 and 22 years old.
00:26:01.96 --> 00:26:03.48 Nearly half the company was black.
00:26:03.48 --> 00:26:07.12 The peers reported that there was little to distinguish Charlie Company from other
00:26:07.12 --> 00:26:08.92 rifle companies.
00:26:08.92 --> 00:26:12.36 The men were generally representative of the typical cross section of American youth
00:26:12.36 --> 00:26:15.76 assigned to most combat units throughout the Army.
00:26:15.76 --> 00:26:19.96 They brought with them the diverse traits, prejudices, and attitudes typical of the various
00:26:19.96 --> 00:26:27.56 regions of the country and segments of society from whence they came.
00:26:27.56 --> 00:26:29.48 Normal people.
00:26:29.48 --> 00:26:35.64 And why it's important to remember that as we dive into this and as this story develops,
00:26:35.64 --> 00:26:47.52 you're going to see these normal people do completely demonic things.
00:26:47.52 --> 00:26:52.76 And now we talk a little bit here about there in Hawaii and they're going through some
00:26:52.76 --> 00:26:59.28 training to prepare them for Vietnam.
00:26:59.28 --> 00:27:03.40 Back to the book, what most Charlie Company veterans remember about the training was its
00:27:03.40 --> 00:27:08.52 unreality and how little it prepared them for what they had to face in Vietnam.
00:27:08.52 --> 00:27:14.44 For Fred Wittmeer, it seemed they had been preparing for World War II or Korea.
00:27:14.44 --> 00:27:19.24 Cali thought they could go to Vietnam and be Audi Murphy's, kicking the door, running the
00:27:19.24 --> 00:27:23.32 hooch, giving it a good burst kill.
00:27:23.32 --> 00:27:29.76 For Nato Simpson said, you can't have no type of training, can compare with what wars
00:27:29.76 --> 00:27:31.80 like none.
00:27:31.80 --> 00:27:34.24 There's no such thing as preparedness for war.
00:27:34.24 --> 00:27:40.96 We trained and we were so psyched up and they programmed you to kill and to go to Vietnam,
00:27:40.96 --> 00:27:48.40 you know, but once you get there, it's a different situation.
00:27:48.40 --> 00:27:54.28 Now I spent my last three years in the military training guys for war and I'll tell you
00:27:54.28 --> 00:27:57.60 right now, we trained guys really well for war.
00:27:57.60 --> 00:28:01.88 And the training that I received preparing for war did a great job and we improved upon
00:28:01.88 --> 00:28:05.80 that the more combat experience we got, the better we got it training and preparing guys
00:28:05.80 --> 00:28:08.08 for war.
00:28:08.08 --> 00:28:16.28 But you can see how important the training is and the training has got to be realistic
00:28:16.28 --> 00:28:19.12 to the situation that you're going to be put in.
00:28:19.12 --> 00:28:23.52 And clearly, you know, they're then saying that this was like World War II or Korea, well
00:28:23.52 --> 00:28:26.56 in World War II and Korea, there's vast differences between what you're dealing with
00:28:26.56 --> 00:28:27.56 Vietnam.
00:28:27.56 --> 00:28:32.48 World War II or Korea, you're fighting against enemy uniformed troops that are on the other
00:28:32.48 --> 00:28:35.48 side of a line that are attacking you.
00:28:35.48 --> 00:28:40.24 That's what World War II and Korea was very much like for the most part.
00:28:40.24 --> 00:28:45.56 Another person in a different uniform that you are going to fight and kill.
00:28:45.56 --> 00:28:47.52 And here we just have something totally different.
00:28:47.52 --> 00:28:51.80 People that are mixed in with the villages, there's no front line anywhere.
00:28:51.80 --> 00:28:53.32 They're dressing the same.
00:28:53.32 --> 00:28:54.32 Sometimes they have a gun.
00:28:54.32 --> 00:29:01.28 Sometimes they don't, it's an infinitely challenging, more challenging situation.
00:29:01.28 --> 00:29:03.60 Now here we go back to the book.
00:29:03.60 --> 00:29:10.12 According to Cali, the only lesson every GI learned was not to trust anybody.
00:29:10.12 --> 00:29:14.78 It was drummed into us, B-sharp on guard, as soon as you think these people won't kill
00:29:14.78 --> 00:29:16.32 you, zap.
00:29:16.32 --> 00:29:19.88 In combat, you haven't friends, you have enemies.
00:29:19.88 --> 00:29:25.40 Ever and ever again, at OCS we heard this and I told myself, I'll act as if I'm never
00:29:25.40 --> 00:29:26.40 secure.
00:29:26.40 --> 00:29:35.24 As if everyone in Vietnam would do me in, as if everyone is bad.
00:29:35.24 --> 00:29:37.04 Michael Bernhardt was also concerned.
00:29:37.04 --> 00:29:40.80 Charlie Company did not match up to the high standards of order and discipline.
00:29:40.80 --> 00:29:43.32 He had learned at the La Sal military academy.
00:29:43.32 --> 00:29:44.68 So this is one of the soldiers.
00:29:44.68 --> 00:29:49.84 He had gone to a military type high school where they had good discipline.
00:29:49.84 --> 00:29:52.32 They learned about the military.
00:29:52.32 --> 00:29:54.56 And then when he got in, he went to airborne school.
00:29:54.56 --> 00:29:58.24 So he was moral, the higher end soldier.
00:29:58.24 --> 00:29:59.24 Back to the book.
00:29:59.24 --> 00:30:02.40 Trained as a parachute as he was disappointed to have been transferred to a run of the mill
00:30:02.40 --> 00:30:04.000 infantry company.
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.56 Bernhardt was unusual for an enlisted man.
00:30:06.56 --> 00:30:11.48 He was a military animal, a stickler for authority and was happiest when things were being
00:30:11.48 --> 00:30:17.68 done by the book.
00:30:17.68 --> 00:30:21.48 But it was not this system that fathered Bernhardt.
00:30:21.48 --> 00:30:27.92 He believed that good soldiers not only needed discipline, but liked it.
00:30:27.92 --> 00:30:31.64 It was the lax discipline and Charlie Company and the fact that officers did not always
00:30:31.64 --> 00:30:35.48 insist on their orders being carried out out that worried him.
00:30:35.48 --> 00:30:40.24 In an argument with Callie shortly after arriving in Hawaii, he found the young lieutenant
00:30:40.24 --> 00:30:45.76 Callow and lacking in leadership qualities.
00:30:45.76 --> 00:30:51.000 So right now we're already seeing some chinks in the armor of Lieutenant Callie.
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.40 And if you remember what Hackworth said about me lie, he talked about Callie.
00:30:58.40 --> 00:31:05.32 And he said that Callie had been kicked out or failed.
00:31:05.32 --> 00:31:08.76 He'd failed off your candidate school three times.
00:31:08.76 --> 00:31:11.28 And they just wanted to hey, we need more of guys.
00:31:11.28 --> 00:31:14.52 We need to have better numbers getting through, go ahead and pass the guy.
00:31:14.52 --> 00:31:16.96 So you got a guy that lacks leadership.
00:31:16.96 --> 00:31:20.40 And it is, I mean it's interesting to talk about how bland this guy is.
00:31:20.40 --> 00:31:24.88 I mean, somebody that's that bland that they literally have nothing no characteristics.
00:31:24.88 --> 00:31:27.28 Obviously the guy lacks some leadership characteristics.
00:31:27.28 --> 00:31:30.40 Well, because he has no characteristics.
00:31:30.40 --> 00:31:34.92 And now you got the young soldiers looking at the guy and thinking he doesn't have, he doesn't
00:31:34.92 --> 00:31:37.76 have any leadership.
00:31:37.76 --> 00:31:43.32 And this is a part that I highlighted because I think it's an interesting perspective
00:31:43.32 --> 00:31:46.28 of what it was like to go to Vietnam.
00:31:46.28 --> 00:31:51.60 Back to the book, we flew over on a continental airlines plane.
00:31:51.60 --> 00:31:56.68 Fred Wittmeyer recalls, it was a weird situation, a civilian plane with a civilian
00:31:56.68 --> 00:31:58.92 student and crew.
00:31:58.92 --> 00:32:00.28 They were flying both ways.
00:32:00.28 --> 00:32:05.12 They were flying people out as well as in, so they got to see both ends.
00:32:05.12 --> 00:32:10.52 I remember getting off the plane and the student just stood there crying as we unloaded.
00:32:10.52 --> 00:32:18.36 They were more attuned to what we were getting into than we were.
00:32:18.36 --> 00:32:22.20 That's pretty surreal.
00:32:22.20 --> 00:32:33.000 Now they start talking about what it's like there and what they're doing.
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:41.24 And there's a province there that they're starting to concentrate on a province in Vietnam
00:32:41.24 --> 00:32:43.68 and some of the problems that they have there.
00:32:43.68 --> 00:32:47.92 In a province deemed correctly to be overwhelmingly sympathetic to the Vietnam this meant
00:32:47.92 --> 00:32:49.80 eliminating the countryside.
00:32:49.80 --> 00:32:53.92 The villages were bombed, burned down, and polarized.
00:32:53.92 --> 00:32:57.56 Sometimes villagers would be warned advance that their homes were about to be wiped off
00:32:57.56 --> 00:32:59.84 the face of the earth.
00:32:59.84 --> 00:33:01.72 Sometimes not.
00:33:01.72 --> 00:33:06.36 It was common practice to shell or bomb any village from which the US soldiers had taken
00:33:06.36 --> 00:33:11.24 any fire even small arms without any warning at all.
00:33:11.24 --> 00:33:15.28 The destruction was almost unimaginable scale.
00:33:15.28 --> 00:33:21.32 So again, was this something that in the wars that I thought and that we would never do
00:33:21.32 --> 00:33:22.32 that.
00:33:22.32 --> 00:33:25.80 It wasn't just like, oh we took rifle fire from a village bomb the whole thing.
00:33:25.80 --> 00:33:29.48 That was not happening.
00:33:29.48 --> 00:33:34.44 This was the reality behind Westmoreland's prediction in 1965 that the war will bring
00:33:34.44 --> 00:33:38.04 about a moment of decision for the peasant farmer.
00:33:38.04 --> 00:33:42.40 He will have to choose if he stays alive.
00:33:42.40 --> 00:33:45.64 American officials frequently referred to this choice.
00:33:45.64 --> 00:33:49.04 The choice's yours, one leaflet, dropped on villages proclaimed.
00:33:49.04 --> 00:33:54.08 If you refuse to let Viet Kong use your villages and hamlets as their battlefield, your
00:33:54.08 --> 00:33:57.56 homes and lives will be spared.
00:33:57.56 --> 00:34:04.02 A million leaflets a day were being dropped on quining province, quying nigh province
00:34:04.02 --> 00:34:05.56 at this time.
00:34:05.56 --> 00:34:12.60 The whole exercise assumed that the largely illiterate peasants could actually read them.
00:34:12.60 --> 00:34:21.72 From 1965 to 1972, 50 billion leaflets were dropped over Viet Nama, 1500 each for every member
00:34:21.72 --> 00:34:24.36 of the population.
00:34:24.36 --> 00:34:30.48 So that's just, when you think about dropping these leaflets to tell people what to do
00:34:30.48 --> 00:34:34.08 and most of the popular or a lot of the population is illiterate.
00:34:34.08 --> 00:34:35.08 Hey get out of your village.
00:34:35.08 --> 00:34:41.60 Well there's a piece of paper flying from the sky and I don't know what it says.
00:34:41.60 --> 00:34:45.72 Back to the book, to stay and be killed or to go join thousands of other refugees in the
00:34:45.72 --> 00:34:50.48 squalor of refugee camps or the mushrooming shanty towns around the towns and cities.
00:34:50.48 --> 00:34:54.32 What kind of a choice was this?
00:34:54.32 --> 00:35:00.28 But for the Americans, the whole point of clearing an area of countryside of its people was
00:35:00.28 --> 00:35:04.48 so that anyone who remained must be Viet Kong.
00:35:04.48 --> 00:35:06.88 These areas became free fire zones.
00:35:06.88 --> 00:35:11.20 Anything that happened to someone who chose to remain in or return to a free fire zone
00:35:11.20 --> 00:35:13.32 was their own fault.
00:35:13.32 --> 00:35:15.28 They could expect the worst.
00:35:15.28 --> 00:35:20.48 The belief that people had been given a chance to get out had made their choice, made
00:35:20.48 --> 00:35:22.80 the strategy morally workable.
00:35:22.80 --> 00:35:28.28 In a free fire zone, the pursuit of a high body count could proceed unencumbered by the
00:35:28.28 --> 00:35:35.12 need to discriminate between combatants and civilians at all.
00:35:35.12 --> 00:35:43.32 No where was this breathtaking carelessness of human life greater than in Quang Nai?
00:35:43.32 --> 00:35:48.24 No one was actually saying kill civilians but no one strived to keep them alive because
00:35:48.24 --> 00:35:53.40 the killing of civilians came to be seen as unavoidable less and less time was spent on seeing
00:35:53.40 --> 00:35:55.40 how it could be avoided.
00:35:55.40 --> 00:36:01.000 To American spokesman, the death or injury of non-combatants was always accidental and
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:14.36 inevitable tragedy of war and therefore somehow uncorrectable.
00:36:14.36 --> 00:36:17.64 It doesn't take a genius to figure this out.
00:36:17.64 --> 00:36:23.52 When the Americans are bombing your village and they're killing your son, your husband,
00:36:23.52 --> 00:36:24.52 your wife, whatever.
00:36:24.52 --> 00:36:28.92 I mean, who side are you going to be on?
00:36:28.92 --> 00:36:31.32 And we know that the VC were brutal.
00:36:31.32 --> 00:36:36.16 Look at the end of Petun Commander when the VC come in and murder the half the village
00:36:36.16 --> 00:36:40.16 or three quarters of the village and burn down their hots and blow up all their hooches.
00:36:40.16 --> 00:36:51.60 We know that the VC were capable and evil but when our strategy is hey, give them a quick
00:36:51.60 --> 00:36:56.32 warning, drop some leaflets tell them if they stay there, they're VC and if not, hey,
00:36:56.32 --> 00:37:03.60 we gave them a chance so if they're standing there, they must be VC.
00:37:03.60 --> 00:37:07.88 Charlie Company spent December guarding bridges and practicing in the deserted village
00:37:07.88 --> 00:37:15.28 of Duke foe, the army called it in-country orientation and Australian adviser was brought
00:37:15.28 --> 00:37:19.56 into instruct the company on how to distinguish between non-compatants, the at-combatants,
00:37:19.56 --> 00:37:22.96 regular suspects and sympathizers.
00:37:22.96 --> 00:37:29.40 He said it was very difficult, so did other instructors from the South Vietnamese army.
00:37:29.40 --> 00:37:36.64 They got the same story from former Viet Kong, the Australian emphasized that you should
00:37:36.64 --> 00:37:42.36 be extremely leery of children, Medina testified later, Medina is the company commander
00:37:42.36 --> 00:37:46.96 so the company has three petunes in it, but overall in charge of the company's guy named
00:37:46.96 --> 00:37:47.96 Medina.
00:37:47.96 --> 00:37:53.16 Now think about this, not only you're just distinguishing between good and bad, you've got
00:37:53.16 --> 00:38:00.24 non-combatants which are friendly civilians, Viet Kong regulars, suspects and sympathizers.
00:38:00.24 --> 00:38:06.88 Now you've got the Vietnamese soldiers who are from Vietnam obviously, they're saying how hard
00:38:06.88 --> 00:38:13.68 it is to distinguish Khusu and then the Viet Kong captured Viet Kong themselves are saying
00:38:13.68 --> 00:38:16.76 that it's very difficult to know who's who.
00:38:16.76 --> 00:38:27.76 So how is a kid from Iowa going to be able to tell the difference?
00:38:27.76 --> 00:38:32.76 You were exposed to something that went far beyond the world as we knew it, said Fred
00:38:32.76 --> 00:38:33.76 Windmere.
00:38:33.76 --> 00:38:38.80 We had just left Hawaii with all the totels, nightclubs and bars and we wound up in
00:38:38.80 --> 00:38:43.12 Vietnam where people went right out and shit in the rice paddy in the morning, dropped
00:38:43.12 --> 00:38:45.76 their drawers right along the trail at any time.
00:38:45.76 --> 00:38:51.20 It was hard to consider people in the modern day and age living like they did.
00:38:51.20 --> 00:38:57.72 I think it went against our value of what human life is.
00:38:57.72 --> 00:39:02.56 Valley was always frustrated and is attempts to keep the children away from his men when
00:39:02.56 --> 00:39:06.16 they were guarding bridges at Duckfo.
00:39:06.16 --> 00:39:12.12 All the men love them, gave the kids candies, cookies, chewing gum, everything he said later,
00:39:12.12 --> 00:39:15.28 not me, I hated them.
00:39:15.28 --> 00:39:19.000 I was afraid of the Vietnamese kids.
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.56 So you know you got the Australian guys saying hey look, be leery of the kids.
00:39:22.56 --> 00:39:27.40 You got the kid from Iowa, the normal American grunt, he loves the kids, he's given
00:39:27.40 --> 00:39:31.72 them gum, he's given them food, playing with them, it's all good.
00:39:31.72 --> 00:39:36.04 Meanwhile, Kali again, you start seeing the indicators of what's about to take place.
00:39:36.04 --> 00:39:39.60 You got a guy that's saying I hated them.
00:39:39.60 --> 00:39:42.000 I hated them.
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:51.28 It's hard to develop hatred for a kid, for a five year old.
00:39:51.28 --> 00:40:02.12 Now they become part of a unit that's called Task Force Barker, which is multiple companies
00:40:02.12 --> 00:40:04.28 of which Charlie company is one of them.
00:40:04.28 --> 00:40:10.000 And this Lieutenant Colonel, like the Italian commander, he is the commander of this
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.36 task force and actually his name is Colonel Frank Barker.
00:40:12.36 --> 00:40:19.36 So they named the task force after him and they send them up to this province.
00:40:19.36 --> 00:40:27.40 Now, inside their back to the book, inside their fire bases, men of the task force enjoyed
00:40:27.40 --> 00:40:31.60 as much of the American world as could be flown in by helicopter.
00:40:31.60 --> 00:40:38.32 They received their mail, American newspapers, cold beers, stakes, ice cream, Coca-Cola,
00:40:38.32 --> 00:40:40.52 and playboy magazine.
00:40:40.52 --> 00:40:45.80 But all around them was the world of the Viet Kong.
00:40:45.80 --> 00:40:52.44 And I got another interesting thing from this book just to show the extent that they did
00:40:52.44 --> 00:40:54.64 this.
00:40:54.64 --> 00:41:03.44 There was 40 ice cream plants built in Vietnam to supply the troops with ice cream.
00:41:03.44 --> 00:41:11.28 And each another figure that I read was that each person in each soldier in Vietnam used
00:41:11.28 --> 00:41:20.52 100 pounds to supplies a day crazy.
00:41:20.52 --> 00:41:31.36 Now the guys, they move into this new province, province, quang-ni, and they start to
00:41:31.36 --> 00:41:34.40 encounter some combat.
00:41:34.40 --> 00:41:38.60 And I'm very careful to say they're not encountering, they're not really encountering
00:41:38.60 --> 00:41:43.20 VC, they're not getting in a bunch of fire flights, but they are getting in some.
00:41:43.20 --> 00:41:47.36 And this is there, they're in their first fire flight, and here we go, back to the book,
00:41:47.36 --> 00:41:53.20 the men in their first fire flight were discovering things about each other and about themselves.
00:41:53.20 --> 00:41:57.72 Greg Olson recalled, we were pinned down in a trench taking a lot of fire.
00:41:57.72 --> 00:42:00.20 Sergeant Cowan was on one side.
00:42:00.20 --> 00:42:03.12 One side of me putting up his helmet to get some bullet holes in it.
00:42:03.12 --> 00:42:05.16 Almost like it was amusing.
00:42:05.16 --> 00:42:10.08 On the other side, there was this other guy just sobbing, he'd come on glued, crawling
00:42:10.08 --> 00:42:14.88 around like a dog, just lost it.
00:42:14.88 --> 00:42:19.08 The first puttune with Jew under cover of massive artillery bombardment, according to some
00:42:19.08 --> 00:42:23.16 of the men, Cowan was totally lost.
00:42:23.16 --> 00:42:28.44 He led them back towards the river, as they broke cover the snipers started up again.
00:42:28.44 --> 00:42:36.20 On Weber, Cowan's radio operator took a shot with shattered his radio set and tore his kidney out.
00:42:36.20 --> 00:42:41.40 He died a few moments later, Charlie company's first killed in action.
00:42:41.40 --> 00:42:46.24 His horrified companions lifted him onto the hovering Metavac helicopter.
00:42:46.24 --> 00:42:52.12 A GI and shock bluvered and howled, no one had known much about shock before.
00:42:52.12 --> 00:42:56.92 If we got hit much harder, we would all go into shock, Cowan told his court martial
00:42:56.92 --> 00:42:58.80 nearly three years later.
00:42:58.80 --> 00:43:03.32 It was terrifying, terrifying experience.
00:43:03.32 --> 00:43:06.52 In later years, Cowan admitted that he'd been careless.
00:43:06.52 --> 00:43:11.32 He'd led his men into an exposed position, so they'd had to fire fight and they're trying
00:43:11.32 --> 00:43:18.04 to break contact and Cowan leads him out into an open area and gets one of his guys killed.
00:43:18.04 --> 00:43:23.76 And then he asked to report back, he got to fire fight, okay, how to go, let's report
00:43:23.76 --> 00:43:26.36 back, what's the body count?
00:43:26.36 --> 00:43:31.04 Is that remember this is all about killing, is all about killing.
00:43:31.04 --> 00:43:36.76 And so he passes up the body count and here's how he comes up with his body count.
00:43:36.76 --> 00:43:42.52 As later, how he arrived at a body count, Cowan replied, you just make an estimate off
00:43:42.52 --> 00:43:44.28 the top of your head.
00:43:44.28 --> 00:43:49.20 There is no way to really figure out exact body count as long as it was high, that's all
00:43:49.20 --> 00:43:50.68 they wanted.
00:43:50.68 --> 00:43:55.72 I generally knew that if I lost a troop, I'd better come back with a body count of
00:43:55.72 --> 00:44:00.88 10, say I shot at least 10 of the enemy, which was pretty hard when you're only fighting
00:44:00.88 --> 00:44:03.36 a one sniper.
00:44:03.36 --> 00:44:06.64 So you got these guys out in the field and they're reported, they're just making up the
00:44:06.64 --> 00:44:07.64 body count.
00:44:07.64 --> 00:44:12.80 Now think about what the fact this has on the war effort, because General Westmoreland's
00:44:12.80 --> 00:44:15.44 up there saying, hey, we're going to kill him until they can't take it anymore.
00:44:15.44 --> 00:44:20.76 Well, guess how many people they killed right there, zero, they didn't kill that sniper.
00:44:20.76 --> 00:44:23.04 And yet they're reporting that they killed 10.
00:44:23.04 --> 00:44:28.12 Well, you multiply that over the whole country and every unit that's out there that's making
00:44:28.12 --> 00:44:29.88 up these body count numbers.
00:44:29.88 --> 00:44:33.64 And guess what, eventually, Westmoreland thinks we're doing a good job in killing a lot
00:44:33.64 --> 00:44:37.44 of bad guys, but we're not killing any.
00:44:37.44 --> 00:44:42.80 And I can jam you up when you have that, even in a different type of scenario where you're
00:44:42.80 --> 00:44:46.48 getting a report on a certain level of progress.
00:44:46.48 --> 00:44:50.80 And therefore, a lot of times the decision, the next decisions to be made are based on that.
00:44:50.80 --> 00:44:57.12 100% any situation that you're in, if you've got your troopers and your subordinate
00:44:57.12 --> 00:45:02.16 leadership with the mindset that they would rather lie to you than tell you the truth about
00:45:02.16 --> 00:45:05.000 what's happening, you're never going to be able to make good decisions, because you're
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.72 making your decisions based on lies.
00:45:06.72 --> 00:45:07.72 Yep.
00:45:07.72 --> 00:45:08.72 Yeah.
00:45:08.72 --> 00:45:17.60 Back to the book, frustration and anger aid away at the company's as speed accord.
00:45:17.60 --> 00:45:22.24 The men stopped believing that Charlie CONG, meaning the vehicle was afraid of Charlie
00:45:22.24 --> 00:45:23.24 Company.
00:45:23.24 --> 00:45:27.96 Faith in Medina, the company commander, was still high, although some G.I.s felt he pushed
00:45:27.96 --> 00:45:30.08 the company too hard.
00:45:30.08 --> 00:45:32.48 Cally was another matter.
00:45:32.48 --> 00:45:38.96 A pinion on him was universally hostile, according to one G.I. and his patoon, Cally was
00:45:38.96 --> 00:45:43.84 a glory hungry person, the kind of person who would have sacrificed all of us for his own
00:45:43.84 --> 00:45:45.92 personal advancement.
00:45:45.92 --> 00:45:51.60 On Smeil, a squad leader in third platoon called him a nervous, excitable type who yelled
00:45:51.60 --> 00:45:53.12 a lot.
00:45:53.12 --> 00:46:00.88 I think it's important for you to know, Smeil told Army CID, that Cally was so disliked by members
00:46:00.88 --> 00:46:03.44 of the unit that they put a bounty on his head.
00:46:03.44 --> 00:46:07.24 None of the men had any respect for him as a military leader.
00:46:07.24 --> 00:46:09.84 Greg Olson thought he was incompetent.
00:46:09.84 --> 00:46:14.56 I remember instances that we were lost one time at night, everyone knew we were lost, but
00:46:14.56 --> 00:46:18.44 Cally wouldn't admit it.
00:46:18.44 --> 00:46:20.60 So there you go, you got a guy.
00:46:20.60 --> 00:46:23.60 We talked about this all the time and say, what do you do if you make a mistake?
00:46:23.60 --> 00:46:25.20 You own the mistake.
00:46:25.20 --> 00:46:26.76 If you need help, you say, hey, you know what?
00:46:26.76 --> 00:46:28.72 I'm not sure we're on the map right now.
00:46:28.72 --> 00:46:30.56 Let me get someone up here to do a map study.
00:46:30.56 --> 00:46:31.56 Help me out.
00:46:31.56 --> 00:46:32.56 Let's figure out where we are.
00:46:32.56 --> 00:46:34.04 But instead, he just lies.
00:46:34.04 --> 00:46:35.04 He doesn't admit it.
00:46:35.04 --> 00:46:37.24 He doesn't own it.
00:46:37.24 --> 00:46:41.12 And no one is going to have respect for him.
00:46:41.12 --> 00:46:42.12 Back to the book.
00:46:42.12 --> 00:46:47.56 I thought Cally acted like a small guy who had been pushed around a lot by bigger people
00:46:47.56 --> 00:46:49.56 before he joined the army.
00:46:49.56 --> 00:46:51.96 Now that he had authority, he didn't know how to use it.
00:46:51.96 --> 00:46:55.68 And he didn't listen to suggestions.
00:46:55.68 --> 00:46:58.36 I talk about this all the time.
00:46:58.36 --> 00:47:01.24 If you're in a leadership position, you need to listen to your people.
00:47:01.24 --> 00:47:02.40 Up and down the chain of command.
00:47:02.40 --> 00:47:05.32 That's one of the main things that he's getting called out on.
00:47:05.32 --> 00:47:06.32 Doesn't admit what he's wrong.
00:47:06.32 --> 00:47:09.88 And doesn't listen to suggestions.
00:47:09.88 --> 00:47:13.68 Many commented that there was something about him that rubbed people the wrong way.
00:47:13.68 --> 00:47:17.80 Medina, the company commander, gave his junior lieutenant a tough time and ridiculed him
00:47:17.80 --> 00:47:20.44 in front of his men.
00:47:20.44 --> 00:47:24.12 The captain called him, Lieutenant Shithead regularly.
00:47:24.12 --> 00:47:28.44 One G.I. remembered, that tended to minimize your opinion of him.
00:47:28.44 --> 00:47:33.32 Other recalled, others recalled that Cally's attempt to win favor with Medina were frequently
00:47:33.32 --> 00:47:37.20 rebuffed with a sarcastic, listen sweetheart.
00:47:37.20 --> 00:47:42.24 So now we have another situation where you have a subordinate leader that's not doing a good
00:47:42.24 --> 00:47:43.24 job.
00:47:43.24 --> 00:47:45.20 He's not being a good leader.
00:47:45.20 --> 00:47:46.20 People don't respect him.
00:47:46.20 --> 00:47:48.32 And what is his superior doing?
00:47:48.32 --> 00:47:51.12 Undermining him in front of his troops instead of counseling him and said, I helped
00:47:51.12 --> 00:47:54.44 him and said, pulling him aside and say, hey, it's okay to admit when you're wrong.
00:47:54.44 --> 00:47:57.04 Hey, you need to take suggestions from your guys.
00:47:57.04 --> 00:48:01.76 Instead he's calling him a shithead, lieutenant shithead, undermining him all the time.
00:48:01.76 --> 00:48:06.76 So now you get put in Cally, and you even worse position.
00:48:06.76 --> 00:48:13.24 Now, they continue to patrol.
00:48:13.24 --> 00:48:20.72 They're starting to take some casualties and they start to go down the spiral.
00:48:20.72 --> 00:48:21.72 Back to the book.
00:48:21.72 --> 00:48:25.76 Charlie company's drift toward brutality took very little time.
00:48:25.76 --> 00:48:31.40 It began with beating up suspects and villages and quickly became more serious.
00:48:31.40 --> 00:48:36.52 Burn heart state of luft from the process Fred Widdmeer did not.
00:48:36.52 --> 00:48:40.12 It explained that Geneva Convention Toss turning our training and in the beginning we did
00:48:40.12 --> 00:48:44.36 what we thought was right and just turned the prisoners over.
00:48:44.36 --> 00:48:48.60 But it was kind of hard after you'd been there a while and you started seeing, learning,
00:48:48.60 --> 00:48:53.64 finding out what real experience is all about.
00:48:53.64 --> 00:48:57.76 Here you are fighting an enemy who doesn't follow the Geneva Convention, but you have to
00:48:57.76 --> 00:48:58.76 abide by it.
00:48:58.76 --> 00:49:03.40 It's like being in a football team where you have to follow the rules to the letter and
00:49:03.40 --> 00:49:06.32 the other team can do whatever the hell they like.
00:49:06.32 --> 00:49:11.92 The voices of authority in the company, the platoon sergeants and officers acknowledge that
00:49:11.92 --> 00:49:17.44 this executing prisoners was a proper way to behave.
00:49:17.44 --> 00:49:19.48 Who would have grunts to disagree with it?
00:49:19.48 --> 00:49:23.40 We supported it.
00:49:23.40 --> 00:49:28.32 They've started to execute prisoners, which is obviously against the Geneva Convention,
00:49:28.32 --> 00:49:32.20 but the way they're looking at it, they're seeing that the sergeants and the platoon commanders
00:49:32.20 --> 00:49:34.64 are like okay with it.
00:49:34.64 --> 00:49:40.12 So the grunts are okay, I guess that's the way it's going to be.
00:49:40.12 --> 00:49:45.000 And we'd mere goes on to say, the first time I saw something really bad was the point
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000 at which we stopped taking prisoners.
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.76 We'd been there about a month and a half or maybe two months.
00:49:51.76 --> 00:49:54.76 There was one guy Medina had shoot the prisoners.
00:49:54.76 --> 00:49:58.48 Instead of having everyone around and shoot them, we would walk them down towards the
00:49:58.48 --> 00:50:03.48 they would walk them down towards the beach or behind some sand dunes and shoot them.
00:50:03.48 --> 00:50:06.08 A couple of shots and they were done.
00:50:06.08 --> 00:50:08.92 As time went by, things were done.
00:50:08.92 --> 00:50:11.80 Ears cut off mutilation.
00:50:11.80 --> 00:50:15.28 One prisoner had his arms tied straight out on a stick.
00:50:15.28 --> 00:50:19.36 One woman was a woman and one was a man.
00:50:19.36 --> 00:50:22.60 There was no question that these two were via Kong.
00:50:22.60 --> 00:50:26.72 The woman was working as a nurse and we found them in a tunnel with all the medical supplies
00:50:26.72 --> 00:50:29.12 and we knew they were the enemy.
00:50:29.12 --> 00:50:34.04 At cigarettes were put inside the elastic of the guy's pants and we watched him dance
00:50:34.04 --> 00:50:38.12 around because they were burning his ass.
00:50:38.12 --> 00:50:42.20 I think it was a bit of making him talk and a bit of venting our frustrations, a bit
00:50:42.20 --> 00:50:43.84 of both.
00:50:43.84 --> 00:50:49.68 I don't remember what happened to them whether they were turned over or shot.
00:50:49.68 --> 00:50:52.88 The more it went on, the more you didn't trust anyone.
00:50:52.88 --> 00:50:56.44 You didn't believe anybody because you didn't know who is, who you didn't know who the
00:50:56.44 --> 00:50:58.60 enemy was.
00:50:58.60 --> 00:51:04.12 As we went on, more and more prisoners would be executed.
00:51:04.12 --> 00:51:06.60 I would say it was a regular occurrence.
00:51:06.60 --> 00:51:10.12 I did abuse someone, a prisoner, a pop-as-on.
00:51:10.12 --> 00:51:14.20 I found myself doing the same things that had been going on all along.
00:51:14.20 --> 00:51:16.52 I found myself caught up in it.
00:51:16.52 --> 00:51:17.96 We caught his beard off.
00:51:17.96 --> 00:51:19.04 That was an insult.
00:51:19.04 --> 00:51:22.76 A pop-as-on with a beard is considered as the wise man and to caught off their beard
00:51:22.76 --> 00:51:25.72 who's a real sign of disrespect to them.
00:51:25.72 --> 00:51:30.36 You found yourself punching them around, beating them up, trying to get them to talk.
00:51:30.36 --> 00:51:33.52 I never did head anyone with a rifle.
00:51:33.52 --> 00:51:35.24 I've taken a knife to them.
00:51:35.24 --> 00:51:37.16 I never tortured anyone to death.
00:51:37.16 --> 00:51:41.000 I think I probably saw people tortured to death.
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.36 So you hear this guy using this verbiage, you find yourself punching them around.
00:51:45.36 --> 00:51:46.92 It's almost as if it's not him.
00:51:46.92 --> 00:51:48.92 He's detached.
00:51:48.92 --> 00:51:50.72 Right, we talked about being detached.
00:51:50.72 --> 00:51:53.36 Well, he's detached from doing something that he knows he shouldn't be doing.
00:51:53.36 --> 00:51:57.04 Yeah, it seems like he comes back and checks back in every once in a while.
00:51:57.04 --> 00:52:01.84 Like, dang, I've got to woke up and found myself doing this thing.
00:52:01.84 --> 00:52:04.32 Burnheart, and outsider is usual.
00:52:04.32 --> 00:52:06.36 Watch the downward spiral.
00:52:06.36 --> 00:52:09.04 It started with just plain prisoners.
00:52:09.04 --> 00:52:11.64 Prisoners you thought were the enemy.
00:52:11.64 --> 00:52:14.44 Then you'd go on to prisoners who weren't the enemy.
00:52:14.44 --> 00:52:19.36 And then the civilians because there was no difference between the enemy and civilians.
00:52:19.36 --> 00:52:24.72 It came to a point where a guy could kill anybody.
00:52:24.72 --> 00:52:29.04 During an interrogation in one very village, Harry Stanley was standing only 10 feet away
00:52:29.04 --> 00:52:35.20 while the Cali and another GI Herbert Carter interrogated an old farmer.
00:52:35.20 --> 00:52:39.32 We attended Cali asked some questions and then Carter hit the old man in the mouth twice
00:52:39.32 --> 00:52:40.80 with his fist.
00:52:40.80 --> 00:52:45.04 Then Carter pushed the old man into a well, but the old man spread his legs and arms
00:52:45.04 --> 00:52:48.16 and held on and didn't fall into the well.
00:52:48.16 --> 00:52:51.12 In Carter hit the old man in the stomach with his rifle stock.
00:52:51.12 --> 00:52:56.20 The old man fell, the old man's feet fell into the well, but he was holding on with his hands.
00:52:56.20 --> 00:53:00.96 Carter hit the man's fingers trying to make him fall into the well.
00:53:00.96 --> 00:53:07.92 Then Lieutenant Cali shot the man in the Xen 16.
00:53:07.92 --> 00:53:12.20 For some GI's instance, like these showed that the official attitude to brutality was
00:53:12.20 --> 00:53:13.60 permissive.
00:53:13.60 --> 00:53:19.24 The result was a moral vacuum, a moratorium on restraint and self-control.
00:53:19.24 --> 00:53:25.08 Common decency became optional, a matter of personal inclination.
00:53:25.08 --> 00:53:30.80 Even those who refused to be drawn in were left morally thrown off balance.
00:53:30.80 --> 00:53:36.04 Greg Olson was in the village when Cali and Carter threw the old man down the well.
00:53:36.04 --> 00:53:37.60 I was in the village.
00:53:37.60 --> 00:53:41.60 I remember seeing people butted in the head with rifles, but you start losing your
00:53:41.60 --> 00:53:43.64 sense of what's normal.
00:53:43.64 --> 00:53:47.56 You don't give up your morals but you become a lot more tolerant.
00:53:47.56 --> 00:53:50.56 We believe this behavior was pretty commonplace.
00:53:50.56 --> 00:53:53.68 I didn't think we were doing anything different from any other unit.
00:53:53.68 --> 00:53:59.60 You really do lose your sense, not of right and wrong, but your degree of white right
00:53:59.60 --> 00:54:02.84 and wrong.
00:54:02.84 --> 00:54:07.96 And Michael Bernhardt, who watched what was happening from the sidelines, was already viewed
00:54:07.96 --> 00:54:13.48 with some mistrust by Medina, Cali and others in the company.
00:54:13.48 --> 00:54:17.28 When I saw American soldiers committing acts that could be called atrocities if someone
00:54:17.28 --> 00:54:21.24 else had done them, I began to think that maybe I'd just been too naive all my life
00:54:21.24 --> 00:54:24.36 that this is the way things really were.
00:54:24.36 --> 00:54:30.04 Little by little, I began to see that this group of men was getting out of control.
00:54:30.04 --> 00:54:31.80 Discipline was beginning to wear off.
00:54:31.80 --> 00:54:37.64 Without military discipline, they were alone in the country with no point of reference.
00:54:37.64 --> 00:54:41.84 The things they had brought from their families and schools were far away in beginning
00:54:41.84 --> 00:54:45.12 to disappear.
00:54:45.12 --> 00:54:51.60 Fred Woodmer, Fred Woodmer II felt things going from bad to worse and felt himself drawn
00:54:51.60 --> 00:54:54.60 along with the retired.
00:54:54.60 --> 00:54:57.40 If it ever occurred to me that things were getting out of hand or that I was questioning
00:54:57.40 --> 00:55:01.64 what, I myself might be capable of doing, I suppressed it.
00:55:01.64 --> 00:55:05.72 It did creep up in my mind because you still have those values of what is right and what
00:55:05.72 --> 00:55:09.16 is wrong that you have been taught all your life.
00:55:09.16 --> 00:55:14.96 I think the frustration got to me, but I also think I began to enjoy it.
00:55:14.96 --> 00:55:19.24 That's what's scary because at the time you find yourself enjoying it.
00:55:19.24 --> 00:55:23.60 I guess you could term it the superiority we had over them.
00:55:23.60 --> 00:55:24.84 It's a strange feeling.
00:55:24.84 --> 00:55:30.000 In retrospect, you look back on it and wonder how you yourself could have done it.
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.56 20 years later, when you look back at things that happened, things that transpired, things
00:55:34.56 --> 00:55:36.60 you did, you say, why?
00:55:36.60 --> 00:55:38.80 Why did I do that?
00:55:38.80 --> 00:55:40.08 That is not me.
00:55:40.08 --> 00:55:42.68 Something happened to me.
00:55:42.68 --> 00:55:45.36 You reach a point over there where you snap.
00:55:45.36 --> 00:55:46.60 That's the easiest way to put it.
00:55:46.60 --> 00:55:49.12 You finally snap.
00:55:49.12 --> 00:55:53.92 Somebody flicks a switch and you are a completely different person.
00:55:53.92 --> 00:56:04.52 There's a culture of violence, of brutality with people all around you doing the same thing.
00:56:04.52 --> 00:56:13.76 Continuing down the spiral, Leonard Gonzalez, a member of Second Paltune saw rapes,
00:56:13.76 --> 00:56:19.40 committed every time the company went through a village.
00:56:19.40 --> 00:56:23.16 One squad got one girl, one lady.
00:56:23.16 --> 00:56:26.92 Then they told me, go in there and I said no, I won't.
00:56:26.92 --> 00:56:31.04 So what I did is I went inside and she looked real bad.
00:56:31.04 --> 00:56:36.48 The only thing I can do for the lady is like, I got the canteen and I wiped her.
00:56:36.48 --> 00:56:37.96 She was awful for spiring.
00:56:37.96 --> 00:56:39.24 I wiped her forehead.
00:56:39.24 --> 00:56:40.40 I tried to help her.
00:56:40.40 --> 00:56:41.40 She got scared of me.
00:56:41.40 --> 00:56:43.20 I was part of them.
00:56:43.20 --> 00:56:45.44 I tried to tell her I don't have nothing to do with it.
00:56:45.44 --> 00:56:47.12 I helped her to her feet.
00:56:47.12 --> 00:56:48.12 I took her to the well.
00:56:48.12 --> 00:56:51.12 I got some water from the well.
00:56:51.12 --> 00:56:57.60 Then another squad heard about 13 guys who did their thing with this woman.
00:56:57.60 --> 00:57:01.92 And we're going to try her out and I told them to leave her alone.
00:57:01.92 --> 00:57:03.88 And then at that time I just walked off.
00:57:03.88 --> 00:57:05.52 I said, forget it.
00:57:05.52 --> 00:57:08.40 I don't want to kill my own men.
00:57:08.40 --> 00:57:10.48 I tried to tell her, get out of here.
00:57:10.48 --> 00:57:12.12 Go.
00:57:12.12 --> 00:57:14.48 She was going to run.
00:57:14.48 --> 00:57:28.44 But after 13 guys got to her, it's hard to walk.
00:57:28.44 --> 00:57:31.08 They're losing it.
00:57:31.08 --> 00:57:33.44 There's no leadership.
00:57:33.44 --> 00:57:40.000 They're losing it.
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:47.48 Now they get into a, they get in a mine field.
00:57:47.48 --> 00:57:49.84 And they take some casualties in a mine field.
00:57:49.84 --> 00:57:54.88 And here's Madena's account of what happened in this mine field.
00:57:54.88 --> 00:57:58.64 We started sweeping the area as best we could with mine detectors taking pieces of toy
00:57:58.64 --> 00:58:02.16 that paper and marking the minds that we found.
00:58:02.16 --> 00:58:05.08 We had one individual that we could not evacuate that was dead.
00:58:05.08 --> 00:58:09.64 I took the medic that was with me, the platoon medic from first platoon.
00:58:09.64 --> 00:58:13.28 But he and I moved through the mine field to where an individual was lying.
00:58:13.28 --> 00:58:17.52 He was split as if somebody had taken a cleaver and right up from his crotch all the way up
00:58:17.52 --> 00:58:19.48 to his chest cavity.
00:58:19.48 --> 00:58:23.72 I had never seen anything like it that looked so unreal in my entire life.
00:58:23.72 --> 00:58:28.84 The intestines, the liver and the stomach and the blood just looked like plastic.
00:58:28.84 --> 00:58:33.72 We took a poncho and we spread it out and started and the medic started to pick
00:58:33.72 --> 00:58:35.40 them up by the legs.
00:58:35.40 --> 00:58:39.000 I reached underneath his arms to place him under the poncho and we set him on top of
00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000 another mine.
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.44 The concussion blew me back.
00:58:43.44 --> 00:58:49.08 I fell backward as I got up the medic was starting to go to pieces.
00:58:49.08 --> 00:58:55.16 I looked at him as if he had stood behind the screen and somebody had taken a paintbrush
00:58:55.16 --> 00:58:58.48 with red paint and splattered it through the screen.
00:58:58.48 --> 00:59:00.64 He had blood all over him.
00:59:00.64 --> 00:59:04.76 I grabbed him as he started to pass me and I shook him and I said, my god don't go to pieces
00:59:04.76 --> 00:59:05.76 on me.
00:59:05.76 --> 00:59:07.44 You're the only medic I've got.
00:59:07.44 --> 00:59:09.80 I have these people that are hurt.
00:59:09.80 --> 00:59:11.08 I hit him.
00:59:11.08 --> 00:59:12.08 I slapped him.
00:59:12.08 --> 00:59:17.000 I knocked him to the ground and I helped him to get back up and I saw on his religious
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:24.88 metal a piece of liver and I tried to get it off the individual before he seen it.
00:59:24.88 --> 00:59:29.32 The individual was very shook up.
00:59:29.32 --> 00:59:30.32 Everybody was shaken.
00:59:30.32 --> 00:59:31.32 Three men were dead.
00:59:31.32 --> 00:59:34.72 Another 12 suffered ghastly injuries.
00:59:34.72 --> 00:59:39.60 If you could forget their own fear or the screams of the wounded or the gruesome task of
00:59:39.60 --> 00:59:43.08 loading the Medevac helicopters.
00:59:43.08 --> 00:59:47.12 When you've been through a minefield and put the remains of your friends and body bags,
00:59:47.12 --> 00:59:51.92 nothing shocks you anymore.
00:59:51.92 --> 01:00:00.44 So that minefield caused some three dead and 12 severely wounded.
01:00:00.44 --> 01:00:02.28 We talked about IEDs a lot in here.
01:00:02.28 --> 01:00:08.88 We talked about him with Jodi, Jodi Medek who got blown up by an IED.
01:00:08.88 --> 01:00:10.80 There's no one to fight.
01:00:10.80 --> 01:00:14.68 The bomb goes off and that's it.
01:00:14.68 --> 01:00:16.72 Who did this?
01:00:16.72 --> 01:00:18.80 Who do you blame?
01:00:18.80 --> 01:00:21.44 Well let me answer that question for these guys.
01:00:21.44 --> 01:00:24.44 Most of all they blamed the Vietnamese.
01:00:24.44 --> 01:00:29.000 Not the Vietnam who they could not see or find but the Vietnamese and the villages who did
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:32.52 not warn them of the minefields and of the booby traps.
01:00:32.52 --> 01:00:35.28 Same thing my school teacher told me.
01:00:35.28 --> 01:00:44.40 They're starting to apply the blame to these Vietnamese villagers.
01:00:44.40 --> 01:00:50.60 Lieutenant Callie noticed the change in the mood of the men.
01:00:50.60 --> 01:00:52.40 He had been on leave at the time of the incident.
01:00:52.40 --> 01:00:56.96 So he wasn't around when this happened.
01:00:56.96 --> 01:01:00.92 He had been on leave at the time of the incident and had returned the LZ uptight and
01:01:00.92 --> 01:01:04.88 time to meet the helicopters fearing the dead and injured.
01:01:04.88 --> 01:01:10.48 From now on the men in his platoon no longer gave candy to the Vietnamese children.
01:01:10.48 --> 01:01:13.36 They came across while on patrol and the villages.
01:01:13.36 --> 01:01:17.36 Instead Callie noticed with some saddest faction.
01:01:17.36 --> 01:01:21.48 They kicked everybody aside, even the nice sweet kids.
01:01:21.48 --> 01:01:26.64 He could hardly refrain from telling them, well I told you so.
01:01:26.64 --> 01:01:40.96 Now they are starting to, after that incident, they're starting to now assemble information
01:01:40.96 --> 01:01:48.64 and intelligence for this raid that they're planning in Mely.
01:01:48.64 --> 01:01:53.84 And I think it's really important to take a look at where this intelligence is coming from
01:01:53.84 --> 01:01:57.60 and how this, because it paints a very important part of the picture of what these guys
01:01:57.60 --> 01:02:00.40 are being told back to the book.
01:02:00.40 --> 01:02:06.56 In intelligence round up for March 1968, prepared respectively, summed up the state of knowledge
01:02:06.56 --> 01:02:08.08 was this.
01:02:08.08 --> 01:02:14.80 Although, Sontin district remained relatively quiet during this period, elements of the 48th
01:02:14.80 --> 01:02:21.52 and existing local force units probably roamed the district countryside.
01:02:21.52 --> 01:02:30.16 The hills north and northwest of Mely area were probable base camps for elements of the 48th
01:02:30.16 --> 01:02:31.92 battalion.
01:02:31.92 --> 01:02:38.72 And it probably received supplies from the peninsula.
01:02:38.72 --> 01:02:45.20 So the 48th is an enemy unit, an enemy battalion.
01:02:45.20 --> 01:02:48.12 And you can hear the word probable being used.
01:02:48.12 --> 01:02:51.88 Okay, they're probably in the area, the villagers probably support them.
01:02:51.88 --> 01:02:58.76 So there isn't a claim being made from higher from above the chain of command.
01:02:58.76 --> 01:03:00.44 But you're going to hear that change.
01:03:00.44 --> 01:03:06.04 So above the chain of command, there's higher intelligence sets making these claims that
01:03:06.04 --> 01:03:09.16 there's probable VC there that they're probably working this area that they're probably
01:03:09.16 --> 01:03:10.44 getting supported from the villages.
01:03:10.44 --> 01:03:19.96 Well, as this filters down, it turns from probable to like definite.
01:03:19.96 --> 01:03:24.20 There is a strange discrepancy between what the army thought it knew about the vehicle
01:03:24.20 --> 01:03:28.000 and what the task force thought it knew.
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.36 Army intelligence made only tentative claims.
01:03:31.36 --> 01:03:37.80 By contrast, Ram's Dell and for that matter, Kutak were almost pontificals.
01:03:37.80 --> 01:03:42.92 So these are the two intelligence guys at the task force level.
01:03:42.92 --> 01:03:43.92 So does that make sense?
01:03:43.92 --> 01:03:47.88 So you've got the higher army above them is telling them, hey, there's probably this
01:03:47.88 --> 01:03:48.88 problem that.
01:03:48.88 --> 01:03:51.92 And these guys are basically starting to say, no, no, this is VC.
01:03:51.92 --> 01:03:52.92 This is what this is.
01:03:52.92 --> 01:03:53.92 What's happening?
01:03:53.92 --> 01:03:54.92 Factually.
01:03:54.92 --> 01:03:58.52 Is that kind of like the game of telephone one of those?
01:03:58.52 --> 01:03:59.52 Yeah, it is.
01:03:59.52 --> 01:04:05.60 And it's also you're going to find as I go into this that both these guys aren't experienced.
01:04:05.60 --> 01:04:07.20 So I'll get to it.
01:04:07.20 --> 01:04:11.84 It was a kind of perverse destiny that brought the two overweight and middle-aged American
01:04:11.84 --> 01:04:18.68 captains, Ram's Dell and Kutak together in TET Kwang Nye City.
01:04:18.68 --> 01:04:23.36 Both were new boys to the real world of intelligence assessment in a battle zone.
01:04:23.36 --> 01:04:29.40 Both were inexperienced to both desperately eager to establish a reputation.
01:04:29.40 --> 01:04:34.96 Ram's Dell had provided to intelligence and Kutak prior to me, lie, operation and the
01:04:34.96 --> 01:04:41.52 curious convergence of their views irresistibly suggests that it was indeed Ram's Dell who
01:04:41.52 --> 01:04:46.12 provided intelligence for the attack on me, lie itself.
01:04:46.12 --> 01:04:51.08 Suggestions at the 48th local force betimes up to 400 strong that everyone in the village
01:04:51.08 --> 01:04:54.12 was Viet Kwang or Viet Kwang sympathizer.
01:04:54.12 --> 01:04:58.48 And that at seven on Saturday morning all bonafide civilians would have left the village
01:04:58.48 --> 01:04:59.84 for the market.
01:04:59.84 --> 01:05:05.68 All these views were shared by Ram's Dell and Kutak and accepted uncritically by Task Force
01:05:05.68 --> 01:05:06.68 Barker.
01:05:06.68 --> 01:05:07.84 So think about that.
01:05:07.84 --> 01:05:15.28 You got these guys saying there's 400 up to 400 enemy in the area that the village is
01:05:15.28 --> 01:05:23.08 all Viet Kwang sympathizers and that on a Saturday, everyone that's our actual civilian
01:05:23.08 --> 01:05:25.56 will have left at seven o'clock in the morning for the market.
01:05:25.56 --> 01:05:29.80 Now you can't make that claim about any group of civilians in the world that everyone's
01:05:29.80 --> 01:05:33.000 going to do something at the same time.
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.64 Impossible that you could make that claim.
01:05:38.64 --> 01:05:42.24 Back to the book, ask later about intelligence indicating that no civilians would be left
01:05:42.24 --> 01:05:43.92 in the village at the time of the attack.
01:05:43.92 --> 01:05:47.88 Ram's Dell replied that the civilians went to market early in the morning because of the
01:05:47.88 --> 01:05:50.28 heat.
01:05:50.28 --> 01:05:54.04 They testified and appears in a similar vein in the civilian market.
01:05:54.04 --> 01:05:58.56 In a civilian population area there were several markets large markets where all the people
01:05:58.56 --> 01:06:04.92 would gather each day because they had no refrigeration or anything like it.
01:06:04.92 --> 01:06:08.76 With hindsight it appears naive even simple minded.
01:06:08.76 --> 01:06:14.84 Yet in 1968 this nugget of anthropological insight along with the corollary that everyone
01:06:14.84 --> 01:06:20.40 who was not at the market was Viet Kwang was deemed unchallengeable by Ram's Dell.
01:06:20.40 --> 01:06:25.28 It was ordered impeccable by Kutak and passed on unamended to the bitter men of Charlie
01:06:25.28 --> 01:06:29.64 Company seeking revenge for their losses.
01:06:29.64 --> 01:06:31.84 This is just a horrible situation.
01:06:31.84 --> 01:06:32.84 It's a horrible situation.
01:06:32.84 --> 01:06:41.20 I had situations like that occur with me where it was early my first deployment to Iraq
01:06:41.20 --> 01:06:44.68 where we got almost like a movie.
01:06:44.68 --> 01:06:50.76 We would get maps of a city area and there would be a red X on the target building.
01:06:50.76 --> 01:06:52.96 You're bad guys in this building.
01:06:52.96 --> 01:06:57.000 And I remember one time we went out we hit the building with the red X on it and we
01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.36 didn't find anything or it wasn't only or the people that we got out of there turned
01:07:02.36 --> 01:07:07.24 out to be not the person we were looking for and as we did further analysis we realized
01:07:07.24 --> 01:07:10.04 that the building was the wrong building.
01:07:10.04 --> 01:07:16.40 And after that I got very critical about okay who put the red X on this building.
01:07:16.40 --> 01:07:18.20 Tell me who did that and why they did it.
01:07:18.20 --> 01:07:21.24 I want to know I'm not just going off of you put a red X on a building doesn't mean anything
01:07:21.24 --> 01:07:22.24 to me.
01:07:22.24 --> 01:07:30.08 I want to know who did that and I had another situation where we went and hit a building
01:07:30.08 --> 01:07:34.96 where there was suspected bad guy we had intelligence on the sky was a finance year
01:07:34.96 --> 01:07:39.50 and had money and was given it to the insurgents and so we went and captured them and
01:07:39.50 --> 01:07:48.18 searched his house and you know blew his door off so we we caused impact to his house.
01:07:48.18 --> 01:07:52.06 And then when we got him back we after we talked to him we figured out this guy was not
01:07:52.06 --> 01:07:53.46 bad.
01:07:53.46 --> 01:07:59.38 And as I pulled the string on where the intelligence came from that eventually led
01:07:59.38 --> 01:08:03.46 somebody to put a red X on his house and described the guy and who he was I found out
01:08:03.46 --> 01:08:08.62 that it was actually he the guy owned a business and he had fired one of his employees
01:08:08.62 --> 01:08:13.66 and when he fired one of his employees well his employee went told the Americans hey
01:08:13.66 --> 01:08:19.26 this guy's a bad guy this guy's funding you know insurgents got a little disgruntled
01:08:19.26 --> 01:08:23.50 so all you had to do is dig in and find a little bit more about the information and you
01:08:23.50 --> 01:08:27.58 figured out it was a disgruntled employee so guys out there in the field right now when
01:08:27.58 --> 01:08:30.74 you're always questioning your intelligence nothing against the intelligence folks
01:08:30.74 --> 01:08:32.86 they're going to do the best they can but they're not the ones that are going to get
01:08:32.86 --> 01:08:34.82 the blood on their hands.
01:08:34.82 --> 01:08:38.58 So question the intelligence find out what the sources are find out where the information
01:08:38.58 --> 01:08:43.74 came from ask who drew that red X ask who said there's not going to be any villagers
01:08:43.74 --> 01:08:48.34 in the in the no civilians in the village after seven o'clock in the morning ask those
01:08:48.34 --> 01:08:53.74 questions.
01:08:53.74 --> 01:08:59.34 Meanwhile the losses these guys are continue to take casualties so they took was it
01:08:59.34 --> 01:09:04.82 three killed and twelve wounded and now they got sergeant Cox killed by a booby
01:09:04.82 --> 01:09:10.22 trap they got a dice and lost both legs Hendrickson's blinded suffered growing injuries
01:09:10.22 --> 01:09:12.90 and lost an arm in a leg.
01:09:12.90 --> 01:09:18.70 So there's continuing to take casualties and on top of the casualties that they're taking
01:09:18.70 --> 01:09:23.62 you're starting to get an escalation of behavior of negative behavior and here's an example
01:09:23.62 --> 01:09:27.46 of that back to the book a village you're passing on a bicycle was beaten up but managed
01:09:27.46 --> 01:09:31.82 to escape a woman working in the fields was shot when somebody shouted that she was
01:09:31.82 --> 01:09:38.02 carrying a weapon when the squad came closer they discovered she was unarmed and still alive
01:09:38.02 --> 01:09:45.86 they shot her again and kicked her body to a pulp somebody stole her ring.
01:09:45.86 --> 01:09:50.34 They were now close to their base and angry villagers stormed the camp and protest against
01:09:50.34 --> 01:09:51.34 the murder.
01:09:51.34 --> 01:09:55.74 Medina managed to hush it up no one was charged with any offense.
01:09:55.74 --> 01:10:01.74 Medina said later that the woman had been discovered with a detonator still in her hand.
01:10:01.74 --> 01:10:06.02 Kelly commented that Medina wasn't about to lose men just because they kicked a Vietnamese
01:10:06.02 --> 01:10:12.78 kid or killed a damn innocent woman he had to keep a combat effective unit.
01:10:12.78 --> 01:10:16.18 So now you've got clear cover up going on by the chain of command.
01:10:16.18 --> 01:10:24.42 Hey she had a detonator she now a detonator and it's very visible to see this downward
01:10:24.42 --> 01:10:36.86 spiral from a letter from Greg Olson who like I said he was the faithful Mormon kid and
01:10:36.86 --> 01:10:40.98 he writes a letter to his dad back in the States dear dad how's everything with you?
01:10:40.98 --> 01:10:45.46 I'm still here on the bridge we leave Saturday one of our platoons went out on a routine
01:10:45.46 --> 01:10:49.34 patrol today and came across a hundred and fifty five millimeter artillery round that
01:10:49.34 --> 01:10:51.18 was booby trap.
01:10:51.18 --> 01:10:57.34 They killed one man, boove the legs off two others and injured two more and it all turned
01:10:57.34 --> 01:11:03.46 out a bad day made even worse on their way back to to Doddy which is their the name
01:11:03.46 --> 01:11:04.46 of their camp.
01:11:04.46 --> 01:11:07.34 They saw woman working in the fields.
01:11:07.34 --> 01:11:11.42 They shot and wounded her then they kicked her to death and empty their magazines in
01:11:11.42 --> 01:11:12.78 her head.
01:11:12.78 --> 01:11:18.18 They slugged every little kid they came across wine gods named as this half to happen.
01:11:18.18 --> 01:11:25.62 They're all seemingly normal guys some were friends of mine for a while.
01:11:25.62 --> 01:11:28.50 They were wild like animals.
01:11:28.50 --> 01:11:32.42 It was murder and I'm ashamed of myself for not trying to do anything about it.
01:11:32.42 --> 01:11:36.66 This isn't the first time dad I've seen it many times before I don't know why I'm telling
01:11:36.66 --> 01:11:40.34 you this I guess I just want to get it all off my chest.
01:11:40.34 --> 01:11:44.46 My faith in fellow man is all shot to hell.
01:11:44.46 --> 01:11:47.30 I just want my time to pass and I just want to come home.
01:11:47.30 --> 01:11:52.74 I really believe as you do dad there's a cause behind all this and if it is God's will
01:11:52.74 --> 01:11:58.34 for me to go I would rather do it here than home on a freeway.
01:11:58.34 --> 01:12:03.62 Saturday we're going to be dropped by air in an NVA stronghold.
01:12:03.62 --> 01:12:08.18 I'm hoping I'll be able to get out of here for a few days to go to a conference.
01:12:08.18 --> 01:12:12.78 Don't expect any letters for me for a while but please keep writing them.
01:12:12.78 --> 01:12:21.66 I love and miss you and mom so much your son Greg.
01:12:21.66 --> 01:12:27.14 Again highlighted in there the normality of the guys and how they're starting to slide
01:12:27.14 --> 01:12:33.54 the clear it's obvious to Greg Olson that what's happening is wrong.
01:12:33.54 --> 01:12:37.34 And unfortunately he's not stepping up and saying anything he's not bringing it to the
01:12:37.34 --> 01:12:42.86 intention of anyone he's letting it happen.
01:12:42.86 --> 01:12:48.14 Back to the book with these most recent losses Charlie company was down to 105 men.
01:12:48.14 --> 01:12:52.86 Since arriving in Vietnam three months before they had suffered 28 casualties including
01:12:52.86 --> 01:12:55.78 five killed three of them in action.
01:12:55.78 --> 01:13:01.62 All the casualties come from mines, booby traps and snipers.
01:13:01.62 --> 01:13:06.14 They had never seen or encountered the enemy in any strength.
01:13:06.14 --> 01:13:08.94 Their had been no heavy contact.
01:13:08.94 --> 01:13:17.62 They were battle scarred without being battle hardened.
01:13:17.62 --> 01:13:23.42 So you can imagine again it's what my what's what my high school teacher told me.
01:13:23.42 --> 01:13:24.66 They're they're viewing.
01:13:24.66 --> 01:13:28.70 They're taking these casualties and it's very similar to Iraq and Afghanistan where I think
01:13:28.70 --> 01:13:33.90 in Iraq it was 75% of the casualties are from IEDs.
01:13:33.90 --> 01:13:40.90 There's no one to shoot at after an IED blows up oftentimes is nothing to shoot at.
01:13:40.90 --> 01:13:49.66 Now with those casualties with that viewpoint they're starting to prepare as I said
01:13:49.66 --> 01:13:54.66 for this this assault on me lie.
01:13:54.66 --> 01:13:59.26 And back to the book although no written record of the briefing survives the witnesses
01:13:59.26 --> 01:14:04.34 all agree on the general thrust of coup tax contribution this is the intelligence officer.
01:14:04.34 --> 01:14:09.14 The 48th LF battalion was dispersed throughout the area.
01:14:09.14 --> 01:14:14.82 But the latest intelligence the assembled officers were told suggested that VC headquarters
01:14:14.82 --> 01:14:22.14 and two companies totaling over 200 fighting men were located in me lie.
01:14:22.14 --> 01:14:28.78 The civilian population were all active sympathizers with the VC.
01:14:28.78 --> 01:14:35.10 By seven in the morning most non-combatants would have left the village for the market.
01:14:35.10 --> 01:14:40.22 So just to make that clear what we're expecting they're expecting to go in to me lie
01:14:40.22 --> 01:14:50.94 and find over 200 fighting men and all active sympathizers with the VC.
01:14:50.94 --> 01:14:57.02 Now they start to ask some questions like okay what at the at the task force level back
01:14:57.02 --> 01:15:00.94 to the book what was to happen to the village itself task force officers left the meeting
01:15:00.94 --> 01:15:04.94 with the clear impression that Barker had ordered the destruction of all houses, dwellings
01:15:04.94 --> 01:15:10.94 and livestock in the me lie area although there is some doubt as to whether this was a
01:15:10.94 --> 01:15:13.34 director or something that been assumed.
01:15:13.34 --> 01:15:17.18 Kutak recalled Barker saying that the village was to be destroyed.
01:15:17.18 --> 01:15:21.58 He wanted the area cleaned out he wanted it neutralized and he wanted the buildings knocked
01:15:21.58 --> 01:15:22.58 down.
01:15:22.58 --> 01:15:26.86 He wanted the hooches burned he wanted the tunnels filled and he wanted the livestock
01:15:26.86 --> 01:15:30.06 and chickens run off killed or destroyed.
01:15:30.06 --> 01:15:32.86 He wanted to neutralize the area.
01:15:32.86 --> 01:15:39.02 From Adina also those were Barker's clear instructions.
01:15:39.02 --> 01:15:41.38 And what was to happen to the civilians?
01:15:41.38 --> 01:15:46.38 There is nothing to suggest that Barker explicitly ordered the murder of ordinary people
01:15:46.38 --> 01:15:48.02 of me lie.
01:15:48.02 --> 01:15:53.10 But the previous failures of the task force and the demand for more aggression the intelligence
01:15:53.10 --> 01:15:58.78 picture of a community entirely controlled by the Viet Kong, the bland assumption that civilians
01:15:58.78 --> 01:16:00.66 would be gone to the market.
01:16:00.66 --> 01:16:05.66 The totally unjustified belief that innocent people had been warned to get out of the area.
01:16:05.66 --> 01:16:10.86 In other words the entire scorched earth concept of the operation planned to neutralize
01:16:10.86 --> 01:16:12.26 the area.
01:16:12.26 --> 01:16:19.66 Drove irresistibly to the conclusion that here was a free fire zone in which even the people
01:16:19.66 --> 01:16:25.34 were to be eliminated.
01:16:25.34 --> 01:16:33.74 Now that's the company commanders getting the brief from the battalion commander from the task
01:16:33.74 --> 01:16:34.74 force commander.
01:16:34.74 --> 01:16:36.06 That's the impression that they get.
01:16:36.06 --> 01:16:41.10 Now we start to get into your Chinese telephone game because now how does that get translated
01:16:41.10 --> 01:16:42.38 down the chain of command?
01:16:42.38 --> 01:16:47.34 And even with the battalion commander talking to the company commanders, there's it's not
01:16:47.34 --> 01:16:50.42 super solid what the actual orders were.
01:16:50.42 --> 01:16:51.90 It's not it's not super solid.
01:16:51.90 --> 01:16:55.58 No one's in a hey they said kill a woman until it's kind of implied well maybe he said
01:16:55.58 --> 01:17:00.02 he wanted everyone destroyed what does destroyed mean.
01:17:00.02 --> 01:17:05.78 So now we get to where Medina is talking to his troops and his subordinate leadership
01:17:05.78 --> 01:17:08.10 the company commander.
01:17:08.10 --> 01:17:13.98 Medina grabbed a shovel from a quarter ton trailer and drew a map of me lie for in the
01:17:13.98 --> 01:17:18.22 dirt at his feet as he described the coming engagement.
01:17:18.22 --> 01:17:24.34 Tomorrow he told them was Charlie company's chance to get even.
01:17:24.34 --> 01:17:28.02 Medina relayed what he had learned at Barker's briefing earlier in the afternoon the
01:17:28.02 --> 01:17:35.86 Vietcong the 48 Vietcong Battalion were in me lie with a strength between 250 and 280.
01:17:35.86 --> 01:17:39.54 So actually he just increased that number because the report that he was given was 200.
01:17:39.54 --> 01:17:43.02 Now he's saying between 250 and 280.
01:17:43.02 --> 01:17:47.70 This meant that Charlie company would be outnumbered more than 21 but they were not to worry
01:17:47.70 --> 01:17:50.86 because helicopter gunships would be on the American side.
01:17:50.86 --> 01:17:54.30 He told them to expect a hell of a good fight.
01:17:54.30 --> 01:18:00.94 He told them that all innocent civilians would have gone to the market.
01:18:00.94 --> 01:18:04.62 He's just amplifying what he was told.
01:18:04.62 --> 01:18:07.98 But what was going to happen to the village?
01:18:07.98 --> 01:18:13.86 I told them we had permission.
01:18:13.86 --> 01:18:19.02 It was a VC stronghold to burn down the houses to kill all the livestock to cut any
01:18:19.02 --> 01:18:25.54 of the crops that might feed the VC to cave the wells and destroy the village.
01:18:25.54 --> 01:18:29.66 And what was going to happen to the innocent civilians?
01:18:29.66 --> 01:18:33.38 Somebody at the briefing asked him, do we kill women and children?
01:18:33.38 --> 01:18:37.26 It was an astounding question that speaks volumes about the temper of the men but the fact
01:18:37.26 --> 01:18:41.50 that such a question was indeed asked is not disputed.
01:18:41.50 --> 01:18:45.82 Where testimony is divided is what Medina replied.
01:18:45.82 --> 01:18:49.42 My reply to that question was no, you do not kill women and children.
01:18:49.42 --> 01:18:51.02 You must use common sense.
01:18:51.02 --> 01:18:54.86 If they have a weapon and are trying to engage you, then you can shoot back but you must
01:18:54.86 --> 01:18:57.34 use common sense.
01:18:57.34 --> 01:19:00.78 But many of the men got a different message.
01:19:00.78 --> 01:19:04.62 This is Sergeant Hodges, right, recollection of the briefing.
01:19:04.62 --> 01:19:07.50 This was a time for us to get even.
01:19:07.50 --> 01:19:12.54 A time for us to settle the score, a time for revenge.
01:19:12.54 --> 01:19:18.94 When we can get revenge for our fallen comrades, the order we were given was to kill and destroy
01:19:18.94 --> 01:19:20.70 everything that was in the village.
01:19:20.70 --> 01:19:25.34 It was to kill the pigs, drop them in the wells, pollute the water supply, kill cut down
01:19:25.34 --> 01:19:29.46 the banana trees, burn the village, burn the hooches as we went through it.
01:19:29.46 --> 01:19:34.30 It was clearly explained that there were to be no prisoners.
01:19:34.30 --> 01:19:39.42 That order was given, the order that was given was to kill everyone in the village.
01:19:39.42 --> 01:19:45.86 Someone asked if that meant the women and children and the order was everyone in the village.
01:19:45.86 --> 01:19:51.26 Because those people in that village, the women, the kids, the old men were VC.
01:19:51.26 --> 01:19:55.46 They were Vietcong themselves or they were sympathetic to the Vietcong.
01:19:55.46 --> 01:19:58.22 They were not sympathetic to the American.
01:19:58.22 --> 01:20:05.18 It was quite clear that no one was to be spared in that village.
01:20:05.18 --> 01:20:09.06 So pretty clear what Sergeant Hodges thought.
01:20:09.06 --> 01:20:12.02 So Medina says no, I didn't tell him, I told him he had to use their common sense.
01:20:12.02 --> 01:20:14.26 If the shootin' at you, then you kill him.
01:20:14.26 --> 01:20:15.98 Hodges didn't hear that.
01:20:15.98 --> 01:20:20.90 Back to the book, Sergeant Hodges was not alone and his interpretation of Medina's briefing.
01:20:20.90 --> 01:20:26.46 Many senior NCOs left the meeting convinced that the order was to kill everyone.
01:20:26.46 --> 01:20:31.90 That Sergeant Bacon, we were to kill all Vietcong and all Vietcong sympathizers in the village.
01:20:31.90 --> 01:20:37.26 Sergeant West, it was a search and destroy mission, we were to kill everything.
01:20:37.26 --> 01:20:40.46 Staff Sergeant Fagan, kill everyone.
01:20:40.46 --> 01:20:43.66 Sergeant Cowan, to kill everything that was in the village.
01:20:43.66 --> 01:20:49.50 Inlisted men too, glimpse, La Martina Gonzalez, Lloyd, Parish, Moss later testified that
01:20:49.50 --> 01:20:51.54 this is what they heard.
01:20:51.54 --> 01:20:55.46 Flynn even remembered the question, someone asked, are we supposed to kill women and
01:20:55.46 --> 01:21:00.74 children and Medina replied, kill everything that moves?
01:21:00.74 --> 01:21:05.42 Harry Stanley said, Captain Medina told us that the intelligence and established that
01:21:05.42 --> 01:21:09.14 me, lie for, was completely enemy controlled.
01:21:09.14 --> 01:21:15.58 He described the formations we were to use following day and told us to carry extra ammunition.
01:21:15.58 --> 01:21:18.02 He ordered us to kill everything in the village.
01:21:18.02 --> 01:21:21.70 The men in my squad talked about amongst ourselves that night because the order to kill
01:21:21.70 --> 01:21:24.18 everything in the village was so unusual.
01:21:24.18 --> 01:21:29.86 We all agreed that Captain Medina meant for us to kill every man, woman, and child in the
01:21:29.86 --> 01:21:33.46 village.
01:21:33.46 --> 01:21:37.54 But not everyone agreed that Medina had ordered everyone in the village to be killed.
01:21:37.54 --> 01:21:41.94 Greg Olson, who's forboating letter to his father, had been posted only two days before,
01:21:41.94 --> 01:21:45.66 has a completely different recollection of the briefing.
01:21:45.66 --> 01:21:49.94 They're clearly absolutely wasn't in order to go in and slaughter everybody in that village
01:21:49.94 --> 01:21:52.98 and anybody that says so is a liar.
01:21:52.98 --> 01:21:57.30 Medina said that any villagers were to be rounded up and airlifted to refugee camps.
01:21:57.30 --> 01:21:59.70 That was specifically addressed in the meeting.
01:21:59.70 --> 01:22:02.70 If I thought I was going to get on a helicopter that morning with clear orders that
01:22:02.70 --> 01:22:07.58 I was going to slaughter every living, breathing, human being in that village, I'm sure
01:22:07.58 --> 01:22:11.46 to God it would have been so appalling and unthinkable.
01:22:11.46 --> 01:22:13.54 I mean, I'm not that stupid.
01:22:13.54 --> 01:22:18.66 I know they couldn't have forced me to do something like that.
01:22:18.66 --> 01:22:21.98 Others too denied there was any explicit order.
01:22:21.98 --> 01:22:25.26 He was like Medina's benediction, Michael Bernhardt said.
01:22:25.26 --> 01:22:30.46 He didn't actually say to kill every man, woman, and child in me lie.
01:22:30.46 --> 01:22:32.86 He stopped just sort of saying that.
01:22:32.86 --> 01:22:38.58 He gave every other indication that that's what he expected.
01:22:38.58 --> 01:22:43.58 Whatever Medina actually said, there can be no doubt about the impression he made to get
01:22:43.58 --> 01:22:46.82 the most of the men.
01:22:46.82 --> 01:22:50.30 To hurt pride, he offered satisfaction.
01:22:50.30 --> 01:22:54.66 To grieving soldiers, he offered a chance to strike back.
01:22:54.66 --> 01:23:00.38 To bidder and resentful men, he offered an end to the frustration.
01:23:00.38 --> 01:23:05.86 Medina let slip the dogs of war.
01:23:05.86 --> 01:23:11.78 Me lie for was thrown in the path of their vindictiveness and fury.
01:23:11.78 --> 01:23:15.58 Charlie Company was going to get it revenge.
01:23:15.58 --> 01:23:18.74 The task force would get its body count.
01:23:18.74 --> 01:23:29.06 This time there would be no mistake.
01:23:29.06 --> 01:23:40.82 So that's where that's the attitude that these guys roll into the operation with.
01:23:40.82 --> 01:23:51.06 And it is not the right attitude to have going into the situation because if KC haven't
01:23:51.06 --> 01:23:55.86 figured this out, yeah, the village that they're going into, there's no battalion of
01:23:55.86 --> 01:23:57.46 the Ackong fighters.
01:23:57.46 --> 01:24:02.22 There's no fighters at all.
01:24:02.22 --> 01:24:06.94 And here they start their attack.
01:24:06.94 --> 01:24:13.94 March 16th, 1968, 715 in the morning.
01:24:13.94 --> 01:24:19.46 Out in the fields of farmer frantically raised his hands by way of both greeting and to show
01:24:19.46 --> 01:24:21.74 he had no weapon.
01:24:21.74 --> 01:24:27.62 He was immediately felled by a burst from a machine gun.
01:24:27.62 --> 01:24:32.70 Along with the gunships, almost everyone in first and second Patuans was firing their weapons
01:24:32.70 --> 01:24:35.38 and now third Patuans was joining in.
01:24:35.38 --> 01:24:41.90 The moment of Vietnamese was spotted, Vali's of fire were loose off and the enemy fell wounded
01:24:41.90 --> 01:24:43.14 or dying.
01:24:43.14 --> 01:24:48.30 It was apparent to burn heart as it was to virtually everyone gathered there on the ground
01:24:48.30 --> 01:24:52.78 that they were receiving no return fire at all.
01:24:52.78 --> 01:25:00.10 There was no incoming.
01:25:00.10 --> 01:25:04.78 The workhold came across a hut which had been raked with bullets.
01:25:04.78 --> 01:25:10.34 Inside Burkhold discovered three children, a woman with a flesh wound inside an old man
01:25:10.34 --> 01:25:13.54 squatting down, hardly able to move.
01:25:13.54 --> 01:25:16.82 He had been seriously wounded in both legs.
01:25:16.82 --> 01:25:22.42 From six feet, Burkhold aimed his 45 caliber pistol and pulled the trigger causing the
01:25:22.42 --> 01:25:25.42 top of the man's head to fly off.
01:25:25.42 --> 01:25:31.46 He was a sight that would forever be etched in Maple's memory.
01:25:31.46 --> 01:25:40.42 Burkhold claimed to have shot the old man as an active mercy.
01:25:40.42 --> 01:25:45.38 Harry Stanley saw that the fleeing villagers were offering no resistance.
01:25:45.38 --> 01:25:49.50 His friend Alan Boyce who lived in New Jersey only a couple of miles from Maple's came
01:25:49.50 --> 01:25:55.82 up behind him with a Vietnamese farmer aged between 40 and 50 years in custody.
01:25:55.82 --> 01:26:01.18 He wore black pajamas and his shirt hung open so that Stanley could see his chest.
01:26:01.18 --> 01:26:05.86 Boyce pushed the man forward to where Stanley was standing beside the trail, suddenly and
01:26:05.86 --> 01:26:11.10 for no reason Boyce stabbed the man with the bayonet attached to the end of his rifle.
01:26:11.10 --> 01:26:14.54 He felt the ground grasping for breath.
01:26:14.54 --> 01:26:19.46 Boyce killed him and then grabbed another man being detained, shot him in the neck.
01:26:19.46 --> 01:26:24.94 And threw him into a well, lobbying an M26 grenade after him.
01:26:24.94 --> 01:26:26.34 That's the way you got to do it.
01:26:26.34 --> 01:26:31.42 He told Simpson.
01:26:31.42 --> 01:26:35.50 Robert Lee, the platoon medic, joined in the frenzy but confined his efforts to slaughtering
01:26:35.50 --> 01:26:36.90 animals.
01:26:36.90 --> 01:26:38.78 He killed a cow that had been injured.
01:26:38.78 --> 01:26:43.18 Lee was from a farming community and didn't want to see the beast suffer.
01:26:43.18 --> 01:26:48.70 Up front, he in the platoon sergeant Isaiah Cowan could see women and children being slain.
01:26:48.70 --> 01:26:51.62 They were stunned by what was happening all around them.
01:26:51.62 --> 01:26:57.98 The further they went into the village, the more bodies they found.
01:26:57.98 --> 01:27:02.94 To conty and he's another guy, conty, the man appeared all psyched up when they landed.
01:27:02.94 --> 01:27:06.42 The shooting once a began, created almost a chain reaction.
01:27:06.42 --> 01:27:08.78 He joined in without killing anyone.
01:27:08.78 --> 01:27:12.66 Inside the village, his comrades appeared out of control.
01:27:12.66 --> 01:27:17.14 Families huddled together for safety and houses and yards and in bunkers only to be mown
01:27:17.14 --> 01:27:22.66 down with automatic weapon fire or blown apart by fragmentation grenades.
01:27:22.66 --> 01:27:28.62 Women and children were pushed into bunkers and grenades thrown after them.
01:27:28.62 --> 01:27:33.54 At one point wandering off on his own, conty found a woman aged about 20 with a four-year-old
01:27:33.54 --> 01:27:35.30 child.
01:27:35.30 --> 01:27:40.74 He forced her to perform oral sex on him while he held a gun at the child's head, threatening
01:27:40.74 --> 01:27:45.38 to kill it.
01:27:45.38 --> 01:27:51.94 Half a dozen people from both platoons then witnessed a stocky blonde-haired second platoon
01:27:51.94 --> 01:27:56.82 soldier from Kansas City called Gary Rochovitz become hysterical when troops from first
01:27:56.82 --> 01:28:00.82 platoon were walking a small group of villagers back for screening.
01:28:00.82 --> 01:28:04.82 Rochovitz aged 25 was older than most of the grunts in the company.
01:28:04.82 --> 01:28:09.38 Standing almost six feet tall and weighing close to 230 pounds, he made a surprise grab for
01:28:09.38 --> 01:28:16.42 Roy Woods M-16 and demanded the weapon as a trade for his M-79 but Wood wasn't having any.
01:28:16.42 --> 01:28:21.94 Don't turn them over to the company, Rochovitz peeled to those gathered there, killed them.
01:28:21.94 --> 01:28:25.82 Wood, who was physically by far as the smaller of the two men, held tightly onto his
01:28:25.82 --> 01:28:26.82 rifle.
01:28:26.82 --> 01:28:32.82 Rochovitz then snatched a hold of Bernardo Simpson's M-16, turned in shot of Vietnamese farmer
01:28:32.82 --> 01:28:34.62 in the head.
01:28:34.62 --> 01:28:40.06 Wood began feeling sick at the side of the man's brain spilling on the ground as he turned away.
01:28:40.06 --> 01:28:47.46 Rochovitz shot two more peasants in the head before handing the gun back to Simpson.
01:28:47.46 --> 01:28:54.26 In the northern position of the village second platoon had also run berserk.
01:28:54.26 --> 01:28:59.10 Employing the routine combat assault technique used by Kali, Stephen Brooksmen also approached
01:28:59.10 --> 01:29:02.18 line of breast and three squads.
01:29:02.18 --> 01:29:06.34 During as they moved they came to dwellings and yelled out lie-day and Vietnamese for come
01:29:06.34 --> 01:29:08.34 here.
01:29:08.34 --> 01:29:15.14 The villagers at the villagers sheltering inside, homemade shelters or bunkers.
01:29:15.14 --> 01:29:17.58 Fragmentation grenades were tossed inside.
01:29:17.58 --> 01:29:20.22 Homes were sprayed with automatic fire.
01:29:20.22 --> 01:29:25.34 Children aged six or seven came toward them with their hands out stretch saying chop chop.
01:29:25.34 --> 01:29:29.82 They asked for food and candy they had received from other American soldiers on the two
01:29:29.82 --> 01:29:32.22 previous visits to the village.
01:29:32.22 --> 01:29:35.26 The soldiers skythed them down.
01:29:35.26 --> 01:29:40.90 After one group of Vietnamese were killed in front of a hot, the first squad leader, Sergeant
01:29:40.90 --> 01:29:45.58 Kenneth Sheel began telling his men that he didn't like what they were doing but that they
01:29:45.58 --> 01:29:48.34 had to obey orders.
01:29:48.34 --> 01:29:52.78 The villagers had to huddled together for safety but the Americans poured fire into them,
01:29:52.78 --> 01:29:54.38 tearing their bodies apart.
01:29:54.38 --> 01:30:05.06 One man firing a machine gun at random, other using M16's on automatic.
01:30:05.06 --> 01:30:09.18 Brooks radio operator Dean Fields witnessed for not a sense in shoot a woman with a baby
01:30:09.18 --> 01:30:12.06 from a distance of about 25 meters.
01:30:12.06 --> 01:30:15.94 Her arm was shot almost completely off at the wrist.
01:30:15.94 --> 01:30:20.34 All that it held, all that held it on was a fragile piece of flesh.
01:30:20.34 --> 01:30:27.14 She ran into a hooch and someone yelled in order for her and the baby to be killed.
01:30:27.14 --> 01:30:31.82 Max Hudson, the weapon squad leader formed a machine gun team with Floyd Wright as soon
01:30:31.82 --> 01:30:36.34 as they passed the tree line, they were confronted less than 30 feet away by a middle-aged
01:30:36.34 --> 01:30:39.62 woman climbing out of a tunnel using both hands.
01:30:39.62 --> 01:30:43.98 She was unarmed but they opened fire and she fell back into the tunnel.
01:30:43.98 --> 01:30:47.66 Hudson and Wright took turns on the machine gun whenever they came across any Vietnamese
01:30:47.66 --> 01:30:50.42 they opened fire, killing them.
01:30:50.42 --> 01:30:52.86 Hudson could see people firing all around him.
01:30:52.86 --> 01:30:59.02 The whole scene was one of chaos and confusion with people moving, yelling and shouting.
01:30:59.02 --> 01:31:08.50 Some of the troops were afraid they would be shot by their own men.
01:31:08.50 --> 01:31:14.66 In the clearing near a small couch, a group of 15 feet in a maze had been gathered for women
01:31:14.66 --> 01:31:19.42 and their 30s, three in their 50s, three girls in their late teens and five children ages
01:31:19.42 --> 01:31:22.50 between three and 14.
01:31:22.50 --> 01:31:26.82 Standing around were seven or eight soldiers from different squads including Huto, Torres
01:31:26.82 --> 01:31:28.58 and Rochovats.
01:31:28.58 --> 01:31:32.18 Gonzalez heard someone yell that if anyone was behind the Vietnamese to take cover because
01:31:32.18 --> 01:31:34.10 they were going to open fire.
01:31:34.10 --> 01:31:40.66 A shot rang out on a bullet penetrated the head of a young child being carried by its mother,
01:31:40.66 --> 01:31:43.90 blowing out the back of its skull.
01:31:43.90 --> 01:31:48.22 Others began firing until the entire group was dead.
01:31:48.22 --> 01:31:52.78 Gonzalez could stand no more, he turned away and vomited.
01:31:52.78 --> 01:31:58.70 Few words were spoken until someone said, let's move out.
01:31:58.70 --> 01:32:02.42 A soldier's stooping over a tunnel yelled for the occupants to come out.
01:32:02.42 --> 01:32:06.66 Gonzalez moved closer and could hear people responding as if they were about to comply.
01:32:06.66 --> 01:32:12.86 Whereupon the soldier threw in a grenade and yelled fire in the hole, telling everyone to stand
01:32:12.86 --> 01:32:15.86 clear.
01:32:15.86 --> 01:32:22.06 Kelly had been called twice that morning on the radio by an anxious Medina.
01:32:22.06 --> 01:32:23.26 What is happening over there?
01:32:23.26 --> 01:32:29.18 Medina demanded to know, challenging the slow progress of the first platoon.
01:32:29.18 --> 01:32:33.74 He wanted Kelly to get his men back online and keep moving.
01:32:33.74 --> 01:32:38.18 This made the young platoon commander nervous throughout his time with the company he had
01:32:38.18 --> 01:32:41.46 frequently been made the butt of Medina's jokes.
01:32:41.46 --> 01:32:44.30 Medina knew Kelly couldn't command the respect of his men.
01:32:44.30 --> 01:32:49.38 Now, under pressure, Kelly replied that large groups of civilians had gathered and were
01:32:49.38 --> 01:32:52.02 slowing the platoon down.
01:32:52.02 --> 01:32:57.62 Never one to accept excuses, Medina told Kelly simply to get rid of them.
01:32:57.62 --> 01:33:02.26 So when Kelly came across, Miedlo and Kanti in the clearing and said, take care of them,
01:33:02.26 --> 01:33:04.22 his intention was clear.
01:33:04.22 --> 01:33:08.22 It was his way of getting Medina off his back.
01:33:08.22 --> 01:33:14.14 He thought nothing of the implications of Kelly's request when he simply replied, okay.
01:33:14.14 --> 01:33:19.06 Like many in the company, he regarded the man as a joke and resented cat the way Kelly tried
01:33:19.06 --> 01:33:23.98 to suck up to the men one minute by calling them by their first names and then shouted
01:33:23.98 --> 01:33:26.78 and bald at them the next.
01:33:26.78 --> 01:33:31.58 Kanti felt his platoon commander had absolutely no leadership ability.
01:33:31.58 --> 01:33:37.70 Among the squatting Vietnamese were 10 to 15 men with beards and 10 women, women, as well
01:33:37.70 --> 01:33:41.82 as a handful of very elderly gray-haired women who could hardly walk.
01:33:41.82 --> 01:33:48.66 The rest were children of all ages from babies up to early teens.
01:33:48.66 --> 01:33:53.82 Kelly, who was carrying a band-alir of ammunition on one shoulder, said, I thought I told you
01:33:53.82 --> 01:33:55.90 to take care of them.
01:33:55.90 --> 01:33:59.94 Miedlo responded, somewhat naively, we are.
01:33:59.94 --> 01:34:02.14 We're watching over them.
01:34:02.14 --> 01:34:04.10 No reposted, Kelly.
01:34:04.10 --> 01:34:05.94 I want them killed.
01:34:05.94 --> 01:34:10.10 He moved over to where Kanti was standing beside Miedlo.
01:34:10.10 --> 01:34:14.02 We'll get online and fire into them.
01:34:14.02 --> 01:34:18.14 Kanti and Miedlo look each other and backed off, neither of them wanting a part in what
01:34:18.14 --> 01:34:20.18 was about to happen.
01:34:20.18 --> 01:34:24.38 Kelly, losing his temper, back in them, toward him, come here.
01:34:24.38 --> 01:34:27.70 Come on, we'll line them up and we'll kill them.
01:34:27.70 --> 01:34:31.78 Kanti searching for an excuse pointed out that he was carrying a grenade launcher and he didn't
01:34:31.78 --> 01:34:33.46 want a way to ammunition.
01:34:33.46 --> 01:34:36.66 Perhaps it could keep guard over by the tree-line in case anyone tried to get away.
01:34:36.66 --> 01:34:38.98 He suggested.
01:34:38.98 --> 01:34:41.82 Kelly turned to Miedlo.
01:34:41.82 --> 01:34:45.06 Fire when I say, fire.
01:34:45.06 --> 01:34:50.30 Kanti stood behind them as Cally and Miedlo standing side by side blazed away.
01:34:50.30 --> 01:34:55.94 They stood only ten feet from their hapless victims, changing magazines from time to time.
01:34:55.94 --> 01:35:00.42 The Vietnamese screamed, yelled, and tried to get up.
01:35:00.42 --> 01:35:05.50 He was pure carnage as heads were shot off along with limbs, the fleshier body parts
01:35:05.50 --> 01:35:08.26 were ripped to shreds.
01:35:08.26 --> 01:35:13.42 Miedlo had taken 23 fully loaded magazines for his M16 in his pack when they had left
01:35:13.42 --> 01:35:14.82 thoughty.
01:35:14.82 --> 01:35:17.22 He fired in a spring motion.
01:35:17.22 --> 01:35:22.02 He noticed one man dressed in red, followed that as he fired the rifle on automatic until
01:35:22.02 --> 01:35:24.50 the magazine was exhausted.
01:35:24.50 --> 01:35:26.18 Then he reloaded.
01:35:26.18 --> 01:35:31.06 He switched to semi-automatic fire and loaded the third magazine.
01:35:31.06 --> 01:35:35.74 After a minute or so Miedlo couldn't continue.
01:35:35.74 --> 01:35:39.14 Tears flooded down his cheeks.
01:35:39.14 --> 01:35:43.58 He turned, stuck his rifle in Kanti's hand and said, you shoot them.
01:35:43.58 --> 01:35:45.70 Kanti pushed the weapon back.
01:35:45.70 --> 01:35:48.18 If they are going to be killed, I'm not going to do it.
01:35:48.18 --> 01:35:49.58 Let him do it.
01:35:49.58 --> 01:35:56.14 He said pointing a Cally by this time Kanti could see only a few children were left standing.
01:35:56.14 --> 01:36:01.42 Mothers had thrown themselves on top of the young ones in the last desperate bid to protect
01:36:01.42 --> 01:36:04.78 them from bullets raining down on them.
01:36:04.78 --> 01:36:07.66 The children were trying to stand up.
01:36:07.66 --> 01:36:12.54 Cally opened fire again, killing them one by one.
01:36:12.54 --> 01:36:14.70 Kanti swore at him.
01:36:14.70 --> 01:36:23.14 Finally, when it appeared to be all over, Cally calmly turned and said, okay, let's go.
01:36:23.14 --> 01:36:27.70 Only someone yelled out that more Vietnamese, five women and six children, some distance
01:36:27.70 --> 01:36:31.66 away were making a break for the tree line.
01:36:31.66 --> 01:36:37.14 Cally burst out, get them, get them, kill them.
01:36:37.14 --> 01:36:40.26 Miedlo's face was flushed.
01:36:40.26 --> 01:36:46.34 His eyes were still full of tears when he arrived with greysick at the ditch site and found
01:36:46.34 --> 01:36:48.78 Cally sitting down.
01:36:48.78 --> 01:36:50.54 We've got another job to do.
01:36:50.54 --> 01:36:53.06 He said, looking up them.
01:36:53.06 --> 01:36:58.46 About 10 members of the platoon were guarding 40 to 50 Vietnamese babies, crying and crawling
01:36:58.46 --> 01:36:59.86 around.
01:36:59.86 --> 01:37:05.58 James Dursey, a heavy set Irish Italian from Brooklyn, was looking at a man in white
01:37:05.58 --> 01:37:11.30 robes with a go-tbe beard whom he took to be a Buddhist monk praying over an elderly woman.
01:37:11.30 --> 01:37:14.78 She was seriously ill and had been carried through the village on a narrow wooden platform
01:37:14.78 --> 01:37:17.70 which the Vietnamese used as a bed.
01:37:17.70 --> 01:37:19.46 Cally was now one of his feet.
01:37:19.46 --> 01:37:22.74 Cally was standing up here on the scene and tried to question the monk who was crying and
01:37:22.74 --> 01:37:26.58 bowing as he tried to make himself understood.
01:37:26.58 --> 01:37:28.46 Cally could not understand him.
01:37:28.46 --> 01:37:33.70 Greasick, who had attended Vietnamese language classes in Hawaii, tried more questions and
01:37:33.70 --> 01:37:35.54 got nowhere.
01:37:35.54 --> 01:37:38.54 Cally was getting more and more impatient.
01:37:38.54 --> 01:37:40.18 Where had the Viet Cong gone?
01:37:40.18 --> 01:37:41.34 Where were the weapons?
01:37:41.34 --> 01:37:43.38 Where were the NVA?
01:37:43.38 --> 01:37:47.86 When the man shook his head, Cally struck him in the mouth with his rifle but.
01:37:47.86 --> 01:37:52.42 Just then a child aged about two years and parted from its mother managed to crawl up to
01:37:52.42 --> 01:37:54.46 the top of the ditch.
01:37:54.46 --> 01:37:59.06 Dursey watched horrified as Cally picked up the child, shoved it back down the slope and
01:37:59.06 --> 01:38:02.38 shot it before returning to question the monk.
01:38:02.38 --> 01:38:05.62 The villagers pleaded for the holy man's life.
01:38:05.62 --> 01:38:09.86 Stanley asked the bearded man the same questions in Vietnamese that Cally was asking an
01:38:09.86 --> 01:38:13.10 English and effort to defuse the situation.
01:38:13.10 --> 01:38:18.14 The monk's vainly replied that there were no North Vietnamese soldiers in the village.
01:38:18.14 --> 01:38:21.58 There were no weapons.
01:38:21.58 --> 01:38:27.22 Stanley translated these replies immediately Cally grabbed the monk, pulled him round, hurled
01:38:27.22 --> 01:38:31.74 him into the patty and opened fire with me those N16.
01:38:31.74 --> 01:38:41.98 As the elderly mamasan lying prostrate tried to get up, she too was killed.
01:38:41.98 --> 01:38:46.38 Her Vietnamese shepherded by soldiers were arriving on the scene and Cally indicated a
01:38:46.38 --> 01:38:49.58 me low in voice he wanted everyone killed.
01:38:49.58 --> 01:38:52.54 He began pushing peasants into the irrigation channel.
01:38:52.54 --> 01:38:57.34 Others joined in using their rifle butts to shove wailing Vietnamese down the sleep steep
01:38:57.34 --> 01:38:59.26 slope.
01:38:59.26 --> 01:39:06.42 Some jumped in by themselves, others sat down on the edge, moaning and crying, clearly aware
01:39:06.42 --> 01:39:09.02 that disaster was imminent.
01:39:09.02 --> 01:39:11.86 It was a pitiful sight.
01:39:11.86 --> 01:39:17.46 Until the time all the firing started, Herbert Carter had been kneeling beside Dersie, quietly
01:39:17.46 --> 01:39:20.26 playing with a couple of children.
01:39:20.26 --> 01:39:24.66 Dersie said incredulously, I think Cally wants them all killed.
01:39:24.66 --> 01:39:28.26 Carter said, oh no.
01:39:28.26 --> 01:39:31.98 He can send me to jail, but I'm not going to kill anybody said Dersie, beginning to move
01:39:31.98 --> 01:39:35.86 away and wondering what would happen to him for refusing to fire.
01:39:35.86 --> 01:39:39.06 Dersie was another one who liked to play with the children.
01:39:39.06 --> 01:39:42.54 Earlier in the day he'd been devastated after he opened fire and killed someone running
01:39:42.54 --> 01:39:43.54 from the village.
01:39:43.54 --> 01:39:47.62 It turned out to be a woman carrying a baby in Dersie who was horrified and ashamed by what
01:39:47.62 --> 01:39:49.18 he had done.
01:39:49.18 --> 01:39:52.62 Olson had seen he was really cut up about it.
01:39:52.62 --> 01:39:57.18 A woman standing next to Robert Maples showed him a bullet wound in her left arm.
01:39:57.18 --> 01:39:58.18 He felt helpless.
01:39:58.18 --> 01:40:01.06 There was nothing he could do for her.
01:40:01.06 --> 01:40:07.22 Cally shoved her in the ditch and told Maples, load your machine gun and shoot these people.
01:40:07.22 --> 01:40:10.18 Maples shook his head and replied, I'm not going to do that.
01:40:10.18 --> 01:40:14.54 Cally turned his M16 on Maples as if to shoot him then and there.
01:40:14.54 --> 01:40:19.94 Maples was surprised and relieved when some of the other soldiers interposed to protect him.
01:40:19.94 --> 01:40:22.34 Cally backed off.
01:40:22.34 --> 01:40:26.22 Seconds later, he and meed low began firing.
01:40:26.22 --> 01:40:31.78 A machine gun opened up and one of the squad leaders tried to usher the man into lines so
01:40:31.78 --> 01:40:34.62 they could all fire simultaneously.
01:40:34.62 --> 01:40:39.94 Mercy stood completely frozen, watching disbelievingly as the Vietnamese tried frantically
01:40:39.94 --> 01:40:45.38 to hide under one another, mothers protecting babies.
01:40:45.38 --> 01:40:50.14 Screaming at Dersie above the sounds of M16 on full automatic, meed low continued pouring
01:40:50.14 --> 01:40:53.58 shells into the ditch.
01:40:53.58 --> 01:40:56.54 Crying hysterically once more, he stopped for a second.
01:40:56.54 --> 01:40:57.74 Why are you firing?
01:40:57.74 --> 01:40:59.14 He pleaded with Dersie.
01:40:59.14 --> 01:41:01.90 Fire, why don't you fire?
01:41:01.90 --> 01:41:07.50 The onlookers saw remnants of shredded human beings, hundreds of pieces of flesh and bone
01:41:07.50 --> 01:41:14.30 flying up in the air as the shallower ofine was repeatedly sprayed with bullets.
01:41:14.30 --> 01:41:26.02 Magazine after magazine was reloaded during the mass execution.
01:41:26.02 --> 01:41:39.94 And as all this horrendous scene is unfolding, there is actually a photographer there,
01:41:39.94 --> 01:41:50.46 military photographer, himhaberlay, and he's taking pictures.
01:41:50.46 --> 01:41:59.82 And he was almost like he was just instinctively shooting, he kind of detached himself.
01:41:59.82 --> 01:42:00.82 And here's what he said.
01:42:00.82 --> 01:42:05.54 I knew it was something that shouldn't be happening, but yet I was part of it.
01:42:05.54 --> 01:42:09.82 I think I was in a kind of a days from seeing all these shootings and not seeing any return
01:42:09.82 --> 01:42:13.02 fire yet the killing kept going on.
01:42:13.02 --> 01:42:17.58 The Americans were rounding up the people and shooting them not taking any prisoners.
01:42:17.58 --> 01:42:21.14 I was completely different to my concept of what war is all about.
01:42:21.14 --> 01:42:22.74 I kept taking pictures.
01:42:22.74 --> 01:42:24.98 That was my job as a photographer to take pictures.
01:42:24.98 --> 01:42:30.90 A normal reaction I have with a camera just picking up and keep on shooting, trying to capture
01:42:30.90 --> 01:42:33.02 what is happening around me.
01:42:33.02 --> 01:42:37.18 I feel sometimes that the camera did take over during the operation.
01:42:37.18 --> 01:42:41.82 I put it up to my eye, took a shot, put it down, nothing was composed, nothing was
01:42:41.82 --> 01:42:46.10 pre-thought, just a normal reaction of a photographer.
01:42:46.10 --> 01:42:47.54 I was part of it.
01:42:47.54 --> 01:42:51.54 Everyone who is there was part of it and that includes the general and the colonel flying
01:42:51.54 --> 01:42:56.78 above and their helicopters, they're all part of it.
01:42:56.78 --> 01:43:02.90 We all were just a one big group.
01:43:02.90 --> 01:43:09.78 Now as all this is happening, you've got Medina who's the again the company commander.
01:43:09.78 --> 01:43:13.22 He's sort of coming up from the rear.
01:43:13.22 --> 01:43:17.14 And he's starting to assess what he's seeing.
01:43:17.14 --> 01:43:21.58 Back to the book, while Medina might not have seen mass executions taking place, the evidence
01:43:21.58 --> 01:43:28.66 of his own eyes told him what everyone else could see that some kind of massacre had occurred.
01:43:28.66 --> 01:43:31.54 In fact, it was worse than a massacre.
01:43:31.54 --> 01:43:37.74 Too many of Medina's men were taking sword pleasure in sadistic behavior.
01:43:37.74 --> 01:43:44.66 People became double veterans, GI slang for the dubious honor of raping a woman and then
01:43:44.66 --> 01:43:47.74 murdering her.
01:43:47.74 --> 01:43:53.58 Many women were raped and solemnized, mutilated and had their vaginas ripped open with knives
01:43:53.58 --> 01:43:56.50 or bayonets.
01:43:56.50 --> 01:44:00.82 One woman was killed when the muzzle of a rifle barrel was inserted into her vagina and
01:44:00.82 --> 01:44:04.06 the trigger was pulled.
01:44:04.06 --> 01:44:11.82 Others repeatedly stabbed their victims, cut off limbs, sometimes beheaded them.
01:44:11.82 --> 01:44:18.86 Some were scout, others had their tongues cut out or their throat slit or both.
01:44:18.86 --> 01:44:23.02 Tommy Lee Moss saw Vietnamese placed their hands together and bowed agreed Americans,
01:44:23.02 --> 01:44:30.18 only to be beaten with fists and tortured club with rifles and stabbed in the back with bayonets.
01:44:30.18 --> 01:44:34.94 Some faggin saw bodies which had been shot in the head at point blank range.
01:44:34.94 --> 01:44:39.50 He could tell because the penetration of an M16 round created a shockwave inside the skull
01:44:39.50 --> 01:44:43.22 forcing the brain completely out.
01:44:43.22 --> 01:44:48.38 Other victims were mutilated with the signature C company or the shape of an ace of spades
01:44:48.38 --> 01:44:51.14 carved into the chest.
01:44:51.14 --> 01:44:54.98 Faggin figured this had been done as a warning to the superstitious Vietnamese.
01:44:54.98 --> 01:45:01.22 Those widely believed that they regard the ace of spades as a sign of bad luck.
01:45:01.22 --> 01:45:07.66 Troops from all three platoons cleared out one and mindless acts of brutality.
01:45:07.66 --> 01:45:13.94 The second platoon were already amongst the most notorious rapists in Charlie Company,
01:45:13.94 --> 01:45:19.06 even the platoon commander joined in on occasions.
01:45:19.06 --> 01:45:26.18 The poshivets forced the women to undress with the intention of having sex with all of them.
01:45:26.18 --> 01:45:28.66 If they didn't strip, he said he was going to shoot them.
01:45:28.66 --> 01:45:32.18 He singled out one woman telling her to boom boom him.
01:45:32.18 --> 01:45:36.42 She became hysterical and the other women panicked yelling and screaming and begging for
01:45:36.42 --> 01:45:41.02 mercy, rushivets decided to let them have it.
01:45:41.02 --> 01:45:45.82 He fired several rounds and killed them all.
01:45:45.82 --> 01:45:50.46 And now we got hobbley again, he's the photographer and this is what he's witnessing.
01:45:50.46 --> 01:45:52.50 Just as soon as I turned away, I heard firing.
01:45:52.50 --> 01:45:54.50 I saw people drop.
01:45:54.50 --> 01:45:58.14 They started falling on top of each other, one on top of another.
01:45:58.14 --> 01:45:59.38 I just kept walking.
01:45:59.38 --> 01:46:01.46 I did not pay attention to who did it.
01:46:01.46 --> 01:46:05.14 By that time I knew what the score was, it wasn't atrocity.
01:46:05.14 --> 01:46:09.90 I felt I wanted to do something to stop this as though as we were going through the village,
01:46:09.90 --> 01:46:12.30 I asked some soldiers, why?
01:46:12.30 --> 01:46:16.86 They more or less shrugged their soldiers and kept on with the killing.
01:46:16.86 --> 01:46:23.02 It was like they were fixed on one thing, searching destroy, and that meant killing civilians.
01:46:23.02 --> 01:46:26.30 I noticed this one small boy had been shot in the foot.
01:46:26.30 --> 01:46:31.90 Part of the foot was torn off, he was walking towards a group of bodies looking for his mother.
01:46:31.90 --> 01:46:34.18 I put up my camera up to my eye.
01:46:34.18 --> 01:46:37.02 I was going to take a photograph.
01:46:37.02 --> 01:46:43.22 I didn't notice a GI down beside me with a Zem16 rifle pointed at the child.
01:46:43.22 --> 01:46:47.26 Then suddenly I heard the crack and through the viewfinder I saw this child flip over
01:46:47.26 --> 01:46:51.26 on top of the pile of bodies.
01:46:51.26 --> 01:46:55.70 The GI just stood up and walked away.
01:46:55.70 --> 01:46:58.38 No remorse, nothing.
01:46:58.38 --> 01:47:00.66 The other soldiers had a cold reaction.
01:47:00.66 --> 01:47:04.26 They were staring off into space like it was in every day thing.
01:47:04.26 --> 01:47:08.38 They felt they had to do it and they did it.
01:47:08.38 --> 01:47:10.38 That was their job.
01:47:10.38 --> 01:47:17.30 It was weird just a shrug of the shoulder, no emotional reaction.
01:47:17.30 --> 01:47:26.58 Now above this horror, you had helicopters that were flying around.
01:47:26.58 --> 01:47:31.66 Some of them were gunships, some of them were there to pick people up, drop people off,
01:47:31.66 --> 01:47:36.42 some of them were command and control helicopters where some senior leadership was flying
01:47:36.42 --> 01:47:40.66 around, trying to observe the battles that took place.
01:47:40.66 --> 01:47:45.66 We do end up with a real hero here.
01:47:45.66 --> 01:47:53.66 A hero, that's a helicopter pilot.
01:47:53.66 --> 01:48:00.10 His name is Hugh Klauer's Thompson Jr.
01:48:00.10 --> 01:48:04.42 He's flying around and I'll go to the book.
01:48:04.42 --> 01:48:08.06 Thompson marked several wounded people on the ground with green smoke, a signal that they
01:48:08.06 --> 01:48:10.46 needed help.
01:48:10.46 --> 01:48:15.22 Returning to the me lie area, about 9 a.m.
01:48:15.22 --> 01:48:19.42 After the first refueling Thompson, mealy noticed that people who were previously injured
01:48:19.42 --> 01:48:21.42 were now dead.
01:48:21.42 --> 01:48:24.62 There were groups of bodies as well as many dead water buffalo.
01:48:24.62 --> 01:48:28.66 Over the radio he warned the gunships to fire only when they could positively identify
01:48:28.66 --> 01:48:30.98 enemy target.
01:48:30.98 --> 01:48:36.94 They had good visibility as they hovered sometimes only four feet, five feet off the ground.
01:48:36.94 --> 01:48:42.62 Gunner Lawrence Colburn in the doorway didn't want to look at the corpses.
01:48:42.62 --> 01:48:48.42 Out in the patty field beside a dike, 200 meters south of the village they watched a small
01:48:48.42 --> 01:48:52.34 group of soldiers approaching injured woman of age 20.
01:48:52.34 --> 01:48:54.14 Thompson had marked her with smoke.
01:48:54.14 --> 01:48:57.94 They were flying close enough for Colburn to look at her face as she lay half in and
01:48:57.94 --> 01:48:59.78 half out of the dike.
01:48:59.78 --> 01:49:04.38 She made a fievel gesture with her hand and was obviously a need of help.
01:49:04.38 --> 01:49:08.74 Thompson put the aircraft into a standstill hover only a few feet off the ground.
01:49:08.74 --> 01:49:12.54 The high gunship told the ground forces on the radio, you have a wounded over where the
01:49:12.54 --> 01:49:15.06 bubble is hovering.
01:49:15.06 --> 01:49:20.78 Thompson and his crew watched as an infantry officer wearing captains bars on his helmet,
01:49:20.78 --> 01:49:25.62 came up to the woman, prodder with his foot, and then killed her.
01:49:25.62 --> 01:49:30.10 Who's in the helicopter could hardly believe what they were seeing.
01:49:30.10 --> 01:49:33.74 Minutes later, over on the eastern side of the village they saw dozens of bodies in the
01:49:33.74 --> 01:49:36.02 air, deigation ditch.
01:49:36.02 --> 01:49:40.26 Movements from the ditch convinced them there were people still alive.
01:49:40.26 --> 01:49:44.66 Not far away a group of infantry men taking a cigarette break sat around on the ground and
01:49:44.66 --> 01:49:48.22 relaxed, taking off their steel pots.
01:49:48.22 --> 01:49:53.50 It was obvious there was no firefight taking place.
01:49:53.50 --> 01:50:00.18 So now what happens is Thompson, he's starting to get, he's starting to be totally disturbed
01:50:00.18 --> 01:50:01.62 by what he's seen down there.
01:50:01.62 --> 01:50:07.02 So he lands the helicopter and gets out of the helicopter and he goes over and talks to a
01:50:07.02 --> 01:50:09.62 young infantry officer.
01:50:09.62 --> 01:50:13.94 A young infantry officer came up and Thompson questioned him about what was happening on
01:50:13.94 --> 01:50:14.94 the ground.
01:50:14.94 --> 01:50:18.06 The officer said that it was none of his business because he was in charge of the ground
01:50:18.06 --> 01:50:19.54 troops.
01:50:19.54 --> 01:50:23.46 Several members of Kelly's platoon observed Thompson's intervention.
01:50:23.46 --> 01:50:26.30 Kelly had gone to speak with the bubble helicopter pilot.
01:50:26.30 --> 01:50:31.38 Stanley overheard Kelly telling sledge forward sledge afterward that the pilot hadn't
01:50:31.38 --> 01:50:34.42 liked what he was taking place.
01:50:34.42 --> 01:50:38.26 He didn't like the way I'm running the show, but I'm the boss here.
01:50:38.26 --> 01:50:43.30 Olson, who wanted no part in the executions at the irrigation ditch, had moved 150 meters
01:50:43.30 --> 01:50:47.46 out to the patty field to set up a perimeter of defense.
01:50:47.46 --> 01:50:51.62 He saw the pilot angrily shaking his arms and just circulating.
01:50:51.62 --> 01:50:56.18 He frustrated Thompson lifted off again in circled area for a few minutes.
01:50:56.18 --> 01:51:01.06 Almost as soon as he took off, his worst fears were confirmed.
01:51:01.06 --> 01:51:05.74 Andraida reported the sergeant was now shooting the people in the ditch.
01:51:05.74 --> 01:51:09.58 Thompson began thinking about what the Nazis had done in the last war, marching people to
01:51:09.58 --> 01:51:11.82 a ditch and blowing them away.
01:51:11.82 --> 01:51:15.62 Furious with himself and everybody else he finally snapped.
01:51:15.62 --> 01:51:20.26 He flew over the northeast corner of the village and spotted a group of about 10 civilians
01:51:20.26 --> 01:51:24.38 including children running towards a homemade bomb shelter.
01:51:24.38 --> 01:51:28.34 Pursuing them were a group of from second-paltoon returning to the village from their murderous
01:51:28.34 --> 01:51:30.42 expedition.
01:51:30.42 --> 01:51:33.78 Based on all he had seen in the village that morning it was obvious to Thompson what
01:51:33.78 --> 01:51:37.38 would happen when the troops got to the fleeing civilians.
01:51:37.38 --> 01:51:42.14 He landed his aircraft between the villagers and the soldiers and radioed the gunships he needed
01:51:42.14 --> 01:51:43.86 help.
01:51:43.86 --> 01:51:47.22 Screaming to his crew that he had to get the people out of the bunker he issued an instruction
01:51:47.22 --> 01:51:50.14 that be, be wielded Colburn.
01:51:50.14 --> 01:51:54.58 If the Americans began shooting on the villagers Thompson said Colburn would turn his machine
01:51:54.58 --> 01:51:59.50 gun on the Americans, open up on him, blow him away Thompson urged him.
01:51:59.50 --> 01:52:03.94 Colburn turned his gun around to face the G.I.s though he was unsure whether he would be
01:52:03.94 --> 01:52:06.86 able to open fire on his own men.
01:52:06.86 --> 01:52:10.82 Concerned for their own safety Colburn wasn't sure it was a good idea to land in the middle
01:52:10.82 --> 01:52:12.86 of a combat zone.
01:52:12.86 --> 01:52:17.66 The pilot confronted the lieutenant in charge Stephen Brooks.
01:52:17.66 --> 01:52:21.06 He said he wanted to help get the peasants out of the bunker, Brooks told him the only
01:52:21.06 --> 01:52:23.90 way to do that was with hand grenades.
01:52:23.90 --> 01:52:28.02 Thompson shouted that he would personally get them out and told Lieutenant to stay put.
01:52:28.02 --> 01:52:33.42 With that he went across the bunker and genuinely coaxed the civilians to come out.
01:52:33.42 --> 01:52:39.06 Crew members in the gunships overhead heard Thompson announce over the radio that an old man
01:52:39.06 --> 01:52:43.46 was sitting in the path of the troops near the door of a small bomb shelter.
01:52:43.46 --> 01:52:46.10 Thompson's voice was choking with emotion.
01:52:46.10 --> 01:52:51.06 The swarm of senators, cursed and pleaded with the arrow crew to come down and help rescue
01:52:51.06 --> 01:52:52.78 civilians.
01:52:52.78 --> 01:52:55.62 One pilot initially queried at the request.
01:52:55.62 --> 01:52:59.86 Thompson threatened that if the infantry opened fire on the civilians his machine
01:52:59.86 --> 01:53:03.54 gunner would turn his guns on the Americans.
01:53:03.54 --> 01:53:08.54 Danny Millions a war officer on the low gunship realized the delicate nature of the drama
01:53:08.54 --> 01:53:13.30 unfolding below and knowing that Thompson couldn't talk directly with the ground troops
01:53:13.30 --> 01:53:17.94 radio the high gunship to tell the infantry to stop killing.
01:53:17.94 --> 01:53:22.94 Millions and Brian living in another pilot landed their ships and flew the Vietnamese
01:53:22.94 --> 01:53:28.74 two men, two women and five or six children four miles away to the safety of the road
01:53:28.74 --> 01:53:32.98 which ran west.
01:53:32.98 --> 01:53:37.22 I mean this you can't get any more drama than that.
01:53:37.22 --> 01:53:46.82 And eventually Thompson gets back to base and I'll go to the book.
01:53:46.82 --> 01:53:49.74 They arrived back at Doddy at about 11 a.m.
01:53:49.74 --> 01:53:53.46 Thompson got out of the aircraft and threw his helmet on the ground.
01:53:53.46 --> 01:53:57.78 He cold his section leader what had happened and when Millions and Livingston landed
01:53:57.78 --> 01:53:59.46 they confirmed it.
01:53:59.46 --> 01:54:05.22 A group of them sought out their company commander, major Fred Watky in the aviation sections
01:54:05.22 --> 01:54:07.46 operation van.
01:54:07.46 --> 01:54:09.46 They told him everything they had seen.
01:54:09.46 --> 01:54:13.42 Watky walked up the hill to the low ceiling 10 of the tactical operation center and passed
01:54:13.42 --> 01:54:15.38 the information on the barker.
01:54:15.38 --> 01:54:20.82 He in turn quickly got on the radio to his executive officer, major Charles Calhoun who
01:54:20.82 --> 01:54:23.98 was flying in a helicopter over the battle zone.
01:54:23.98 --> 01:54:28.18 Calhoun was instructed to find out what was happening and get it stopped.
01:54:28.18 --> 01:54:31.02 There had been allegations that civilians had been shot.
01:54:31.02 --> 01:54:37.02 The doctor wanted his insurance from a dean of that nothing of this kind was happening.
01:54:37.02 --> 01:54:49.58 The order went out to Charlie Company to cease fire and they did.
01:54:49.58 --> 01:54:59.34 And almost as quickly as it started it stopped.
01:54:59.34 --> 01:55:12.18 It shows you that this whole time when all this horror was taking place.
01:55:12.18 --> 01:55:14.90 Anybody could have stopped it.
01:55:14.90 --> 01:55:21.10 Had they stepped up and said something and spoke.
01:55:21.10 --> 01:55:24.10 Now it might have been hard for someone that's a junior and listed guy that's 18 years
01:55:24.10 --> 01:55:26.90 old that thinks he's carrying out the mission but any of those people in the leadership
01:55:26.90 --> 01:55:29.74 position.
01:55:29.74 --> 01:55:34.70 And even some of the folks at work leadership position if you're there and you start to
01:55:34.70 --> 01:55:37.42 say no this isn't going to be happening.
01:55:37.42 --> 01:55:42.14 I mean and you did or some guys on the ground that resisted but no one was able to actually
01:55:42.14 --> 01:55:44.14 stop it.
01:55:44.14 --> 01:55:50.42 And it's one of those bizarre things when I hear that all it took was that order to see
01:55:50.42 --> 01:55:54.74 fire and okay well stop shooting.
01:55:54.74 --> 01:56:08.02 It shows you the power of leadership and the responsibility of leadership.
01:56:08.02 --> 01:56:16.38 Now as this story goes forward the first thing that happens is a big cover up and they
01:56:16.38 --> 01:56:23.18 talk about this operation like it was just a great victory over the VC and in fact a message
01:56:23.18 --> 01:56:27.22 I'm going to the book here a message of congratulations for the pink feel operation.
01:56:27.22 --> 01:56:31.18 That's what the operation is called pink feel was received from general West Moreland
01:56:31.18 --> 01:56:40.14 himself in a post-grip that brigade commander described the me lie operation as having
01:56:40.14 --> 01:56:42.78 been an outstanding success.
01:56:42.78 --> 01:56:47.94 The praise worthy role of units in the eleventh infantry brigade directly reflects your
01:56:47.94 --> 01:56:53.54 expert guidance leadership and devotion to duty he wrote to Medina copying the memo to
01:56:53.54 --> 01:56:55.74 Barker.
01:56:55.74 --> 01:57:00.82 The quick response and professionalism displayed during this action has enhanced the brigade's
01:57:00.82 --> 01:57:05.62 image in the eyes of higher commands.
01:57:05.62 --> 01:57:08.14 So there you go.
01:57:08.14 --> 01:57:13.62 Within a few hours the army's PR machine was pumping out a colorful image of daring
01:57:13.62 --> 01:57:17.54 due by the American troops.
01:57:17.54 --> 01:57:23.94 The Mac V communique issued later the same day from Saigon gave brief details the operation
01:57:23.94 --> 01:57:30.82 announcing that American division forces had killed 128 enemy six miles northeast of
01:57:30.82 --> 01:57:37.50 Quining City, US troops surrounded reds, kill 128.
01:57:37.50 --> 01:57:43.98 There's another headline that went out that said TF Barker crushes enemy stronghold.
01:57:43.98 --> 01:57:52.74 That attitude continues now Barker, the battalion commander, ends up being killed before
01:57:52.74 --> 01:57:59.94 he's killed his he releases his assessment of the operation and this is what he starts
01:57:59.94 --> 01:58:02.74 as you see cover up written all over this.
01:58:02.74 --> 01:58:07.22 Here's Barker's official report.
01:58:07.22 --> 01:58:10.50 This operation was well planned, well executed and successful.
01:58:10.50 --> 01:58:14.14 Only casualties were light and the enemy suffered heavily.
01:58:14.14 --> 01:58:18.86 On this operation the civilian population supporting the VC in the area numbered approximately
01:58:18.86 --> 01:58:20.42 200.
01:58:20.42 --> 01:58:24.18 This created a problem in population control and medical care of those civilians caught in
01:58:24.18 --> 01:58:26.18 the fire of opposing forces.
01:58:26.18 --> 01:58:30.82 However the infantry unit on the ground and helicopters were able to assist civilians and
01:58:30.82 --> 01:58:35.30 leaving the area and in caring for and or evacuating the wounded.
01:58:35.30 --> 01:58:43.14 This lies just lies another another piece.
01:58:43.14 --> 01:58:48.82 Barker was genuinely concerned that civilians be protected in future operations and there's
01:58:48.82 --> 01:58:52.70 no way he could have known the dreadful atrocity being committed by Charlie Company
01:58:52.70 --> 01:58:58.46 at the time it was happening but it's clear he quickly became part of the cover up.
01:58:58.46 --> 01:59:03.54 He knew civilians had died and a lot of them.
01:59:03.54 --> 01:59:08.74 Now so this starts to gain a little bit of traction people are starting to talk about
01:59:08.74 --> 01:59:14.18 there's rumors of even though these big nice headlines come out and the official report
01:59:14.18 --> 01:59:17.46 comes out but people start to know about it.
01:59:17.46 --> 01:59:21.86 And so they start sending Charlie Company and all kinds of crazy long term operations
01:59:21.86 --> 01:59:26.10 out in the field and they start to feel like well good to look.
01:59:26.10 --> 01:59:32.14 GIs felt they were being sent out in the hopes that they all might be killed.
01:59:32.14 --> 01:59:36.58 They tried to bury us out there when we're bitterly remembered.
01:59:36.58 --> 01:59:41.10 After me lie we went out in the field for three months straight.
01:59:41.10 --> 01:59:42.82 We never came back into the villages.
01:59:42.82 --> 01:59:45.94 Our trips to the base camps were few and far between.
01:59:45.94 --> 01:59:50.74 They had a problem and dealt with us by trying to hide out and hide out in the jungle hoping
01:59:50.74 --> 01:59:59.26 we'd all get killed but we didn't.
01:59:59.26 --> 02:00:05.38 So a guy, like I said people are talking about it there's rumors about it and there's
02:00:05.38 --> 02:00:14.30 a guy named Rightenauer who checks in to Charlie Company and he starts here in stories.
02:00:14.30 --> 02:00:15.30 He starts here in stories.
02:00:15.30 --> 02:00:18.70 He starts they start telling them they start talking and this is why you can't ever cover
02:00:18.70 --> 02:00:19.70 anything up.
02:00:19.70 --> 02:00:21.42 This is why cover up's never worked.
02:00:21.42 --> 02:00:24.86 Never trying to cover anything up because it's going to come out.
02:00:24.86 --> 02:00:25.70 It's going to come out.
02:00:25.70 --> 02:00:27.50 If you try and cover something up it's going to come out.
02:00:27.50 --> 02:00:29.22 That's the way it works.
02:00:29.22 --> 02:00:36.74 So this guy, right now, after he hears enough and he talks to all these different people
02:00:36.74 --> 02:00:41.58 that are more involved and they tell him what they did and what went down and he kind of
02:00:41.58 --> 02:00:44.98 gathers all that information.
02:00:44.98 --> 02:00:47.14 Here we go back to the book.
02:00:47.14 --> 02:00:48.94 Rightenauer, he writes a letter.
02:00:48.94 --> 02:00:53.62 He writes a letter that explains what he had learned, what he'd found out.
02:00:53.62 --> 02:01:00.58 Here we go right now, we're posted the letter on April 2nd, 1969 to you doll and 30 prominent
02:01:00.58 --> 02:01:07.18 men in Washington DC including President Nixon, the Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird,
02:01:07.18 --> 02:01:11.98 the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Edward Kennedy, Barry Goldwater, Eugene McCarthy
02:01:11.98 --> 02:01:14.18 and William Fulbright.
02:01:14.18 --> 02:01:17.86 He sent the letters a registered mail thinking that staff opening them would be bound to
02:01:17.86 --> 02:01:20.38 take the comments to contents more seriously.
02:01:20.38 --> 02:01:27.98 And here's a little excerpt from the letter, gentlemen, it was in late April 1968 that
02:01:27.98 --> 02:01:32.62 I first heard of Pinkville and what allegedly happened there.
02:01:32.62 --> 02:01:37.38 I received that first report with some skepticism but in the following months I was
02:01:37.38 --> 02:01:42.38 to hear similar stories from such a wide variety of people that it became impossible for
02:01:42.38 --> 02:01:48.42 me to disbelieve that something rather dark and bloody did indeed occur sometime in March
02:01:48.42 --> 02:01:59.22 1968 in a village called Pinkville in the Republic of Vietnam.
02:01:59.22 --> 02:02:01.86 So that's how the story breaks.
02:02:01.86 --> 02:02:04.90 They start to investigate it.
02:02:04.90 --> 02:02:08.58 Within the Pentagon, they start to investigate this great, this book is great, goes into
02:02:08.58 --> 02:02:12.78 a ton of detail on what that's like, how that takes place.
02:02:12.78 --> 02:02:19.90 The people that are running it and there's good, honest, solid army leadership that says,
02:02:19.90 --> 02:02:24.86 oh no, we're going to find out what happened and we're going to do something about it.
02:02:24.86 --> 02:02:28.82 So the cover up isn't throughout the chain of commanders, people that try and put a stop
02:02:28.82 --> 02:02:29.82 to it.
02:02:29.82 --> 02:02:38.82 Now the other thing that turns very interesting on this is obviously when it hits the public.
02:02:38.82 --> 02:02:45.62 And one of the most shocking impacts to the public took place on television.
02:02:45.62 --> 02:02:49.62 And if you remember at this time, and I don't know if this was like for you because you're
02:02:49.62 --> 02:02:54.74 a little bit younger than me, but when I was a kid, we had three TV channels.
02:02:54.74 --> 02:02:59.54 There was no 57 or 147 or 1000 TV channels.
02:02:59.54 --> 02:03:01.02 There was no internet.
02:03:01.02 --> 02:03:03.10 We didn't really, there wasn't really radio shows anymore.
02:03:03.10 --> 02:03:07.78 So if the family was going to do something at night at six o'clock at night or seven o'clock
02:03:07.78 --> 02:03:12.34 at night together after dinner, there was a good chance they were going to sit down and watch TV.
02:03:12.34 --> 02:03:14.54 And now you go back this 1969.
02:03:14.54 --> 02:03:18.70 So it's even more focused on television.
02:03:18.70 --> 02:03:25.06 And so what happens is this story breaks on TV with an interview and I'll go to the
02:03:25.06 --> 02:03:29.18 book with me, those confession.
02:03:29.18 --> 02:03:34.18 Television was for most Americans, quintessentially a medium of entertainment.
02:03:34.18 --> 02:03:39.34 The lead-lo's confession was truly an extraordinary departure from the vapid diet of soap
02:03:39.34 --> 02:03:43.14 operas comedy programs and quiz shows.
02:03:43.14 --> 02:03:46.34 News, however, was important to American audiences.
02:03:46.34 --> 02:03:49.70 Walter Kronkite was a national institution.
02:03:49.70 --> 02:03:54.74 Meadlo's interview was delivered virtually without warning to an audience of millions of
02:03:54.74 --> 02:04:00.30 parents and children waiting excitedly for news of Apollo 12's astronauts return from
02:04:00.30 --> 02:04:04.14 the moon and the splash down into the Pacific Ocean.
02:04:04.14 --> 02:04:05.86 That's what everyone thinks that's what they're going to say.
02:04:05.86 --> 02:04:07.70 Oh, let's get the kids to watch the news.
02:04:07.70 --> 02:04:11.14 And we'll find out about, yay, yay, America.
02:04:11.14 --> 02:04:12.14 Back to the book.
02:04:12.14 --> 02:04:18.30 Instead, they're living rooms appeared the gauchess figure of a young man from Indiana.
02:04:18.30 --> 02:04:22.62 Meadlo brought to the audience a raw truth about Vietnam.
02:04:22.62 --> 02:04:25.58 They would prefer not to have known.
02:04:25.58 --> 02:04:30.30 He chillingly described lining up first the first group of villagers and shooting them
02:04:30.30 --> 02:04:34.10 down, expanding four clips of ammunition in the killing.
02:04:34.10 --> 02:04:42.74 There were 17 bullets to a clip which meant Wallace deducted deduced 68 shots.
02:04:42.74 --> 02:04:47.78 At the ditch execution site, Meadlo said he was ordered to fire single shots to conserve
02:04:47.78 --> 02:04:50.50 ammunition.
02:04:50.50 --> 02:04:56.02 Wallace wanted to know why he did it.
02:04:56.02 --> 02:04:57.30 And here's the interview.
02:04:57.30 --> 02:04:59.14 Why did I do it?
02:04:59.14 --> 02:05:04.02 Because I felt like I was ordered to do it and it seemed like that at the time I
02:05:04.02 --> 02:05:07.90 felt like I was doing the right thing because I lost buddies.
02:05:07.90 --> 02:05:12.66 I lost a damn good buddy Bobby Wilson and it was on my conscience.
02:05:12.66 --> 02:05:15.46 So after I done it, I felt good.
02:05:15.46 --> 02:05:20.98 But later on that day, it was getting to me.
02:05:20.98 --> 02:05:23.30 You're married, right?
02:05:23.30 --> 02:05:25.90 Children, too.
02:05:25.90 --> 02:05:27.14 How old?
02:05:27.14 --> 02:05:31.54 The boy is two and a half and the little girl is a year and a half.
02:05:31.54 --> 02:05:36.58 Well, obviously the question comes to mind, the father of two little kids like that,
02:05:36.58 --> 02:05:39.10 how can you shoot babies?
02:05:39.10 --> 02:05:40.38 I didn't have the little girl.
02:05:40.38 --> 02:05:43.26 I just had the little boy at the time.
02:05:43.26 --> 02:05:45.78 How do you shoot babies?
02:05:45.78 --> 02:05:46.78 I don't know.
02:05:46.78 --> 02:05:49.38 It's just one of them things.
02:05:49.38 --> 02:05:52.86 How many people would you imagine were killed that day?
02:05:52.86 --> 02:05:56.18 I would say 370.
02:05:56.18 --> 02:06:00.38 What did these civilians, these particularly the women and children, the old men, what did
02:06:00.38 --> 02:06:01.62 they do?
02:06:01.62 --> 02:06:03.62 What did they say to you?
02:06:03.62 --> 02:06:05.22 They weren't begging or anything?
02:06:05.22 --> 02:06:07.98 No, no, or right.
02:06:07.98 --> 02:06:12.90 They were begging and saying no, no, and their mothers were hugging their children, but
02:06:12.90 --> 02:06:15.14 they kept on firing.
02:06:15.14 --> 02:06:17.54 Well, we kept on firing.
02:06:17.54 --> 02:06:21.98 They was waving their arms and begging.
02:06:21.98 --> 02:06:25.54 Did you ever dream about all this that went on in pinkville?
02:06:25.54 --> 02:06:27.66 Yes, I did.
02:06:27.66 --> 02:06:29.94 And I still dream about it.
02:06:29.94 --> 02:06:31.82 What kind of dreams?
02:06:31.82 --> 02:06:35.22 I see the women and children in my sleep.
02:06:35.22 --> 02:06:40.02 Some days, some nights, I can't sleep.
02:06:40.02 --> 02:06:44.82 I just lay there thinking about it.
02:06:44.82 --> 02:06:49.62 So that's not exactly the friendly news that you're expecting to see about the Apollo
02:06:49.62 --> 02:06:53.46 mission.
02:06:53.46 --> 02:06:56.70 Now this thing goes to trial.
02:06:56.70 --> 02:07:01.06 And again, you got to get into the book to see how all this breaks down.
02:07:01.06 --> 02:07:02.62 But a couple highlights.
02:07:02.62 --> 02:07:13.50 Here's Lieutenant Callie during the trial on how he testified on what he did.
02:07:13.50 --> 02:07:16.50 And this is a good insight into his mind, said, here we go.
02:07:16.50 --> 02:07:17.50 Lieutenant Callie.
02:07:17.50 --> 02:07:20.70 I was ordered to go in there and destroy the enemy.
02:07:20.70 --> 02:07:22.34 That was my job that day.
02:07:22.34 --> 02:07:23.34 That was my mission.
02:07:23.34 --> 02:07:24.34 I was given.
02:07:24.34 --> 02:07:27.66 I did not sit down and think in terms of men, women, and children.
02:07:27.66 --> 02:07:29.62 They were all classified the same.
02:07:29.62 --> 02:07:34.22 And that was the classification that we dealt with just as enemy soldiers.
02:07:34.22 --> 02:07:35.34 I felt then.
02:07:35.34 --> 02:07:38.18 And I still do that I acted as I was directed.
02:07:38.18 --> 02:07:40.02 And I carried out the orders that I was given.
02:07:40.02 --> 02:07:44.50 And I do not feel wrong in doing so.
02:07:44.50 --> 02:07:51.70 And we get very used to the media.
02:07:51.70 --> 02:07:54.02 I mean, we're in a media circus.
02:07:54.02 --> 02:07:58.22 Nowadays, because there's so much media, there's social media, there's cable media,
02:07:58.22 --> 02:07:59.22 there's internet media.
02:07:59.22 --> 02:08:02.18 I mean, we get there's a circus of media now.
02:08:02.18 --> 02:08:05.26 And you get a lot, I would say, you can get a lot more distracted.
02:08:05.26 --> 02:08:07.18 I mean, new stories here don't last that long.
02:08:07.18 --> 02:08:09.94 But this was a big new story.
02:08:09.94 --> 02:08:15.18 And it was really dividing the country in a way even more so than the country is already
02:08:15.18 --> 02:08:17.22 being divided by the Vietnam War.
02:08:17.22 --> 02:08:23.42 But, and I'll go to the book here, to many Americans, Callie was a hero.
02:08:23.42 --> 02:08:27.22 And they believed that with the guilty verdict he was found guilty, a great injustice
02:08:27.22 --> 02:08:29.82 had been perpetrated upon the army.
02:08:29.82 --> 02:08:36.26 And in Vietnam, they gave an example here in Vietnam that soldiers at K-Son had hastily
02:08:36.26 --> 02:08:45.58 raised a defiant sign that said, a troop first-cav, salutes William Callie.
02:08:45.58 --> 02:08:50.06 So you got people that are saying, hey, what, you know, Callie was Callie did the right
02:08:50.06 --> 02:08:52.86 thing out there.
02:08:52.86 --> 02:08:57.66 On top of that, this was a good example of what the attitude of some Americans were
02:08:57.66 --> 02:09:06.26 it was at a World War II veteran went into an army recruiting office in Mobile, Alabama
02:09:06.26 --> 02:09:08.86 to make an extraordinary request.
02:09:08.86 --> 02:09:13.34 He had flown bombing missions over Germany which had killed innocent civilians and wanted
02:09:13.34 --> 02:09:16.38 to be arrested for war crimes.
02:09:16.38 --> 02:09:22.98 Despite, and another good example that somebody sent a goat, a Billy goat, a living
02:09:22.98 --> 02:09:27.90 Billy goat, and sent it to the White House and it had a jacket on and the jacket said,
02:09:27.90 --> 02:09:29.98 scapegoat on it.
02:09:29.98 --> 02:09:32.14 And this is pretty cool.
02:09:32.14 --> 02:09:37.90 The response that the army and the government had to this, Callie is not a scapegoat, nor
02:09:37.90 --> 02:09:44.22 a poor lieutenant single-out to bear the entire burden of a difficult war.
02:09:44.22 --> 02:09:50.34 It's clear to high level army memorandum circling amongst senior staff at the White House.
02:09:50.34 --> 02:09:57.26 His act stand alone and infamy among known atrocities for the US forces in the war.
02:09:57.26 --> 02:10:02.30 If Callie is let go or let off with a slap on the wrist, the message to all soldiers must
02:10:02.30 --> 02:10:05.30 read anything goes.
02:10:05.30 --> 02:10:14.18 The implications for the army let alone the nation are incalculable but clearly intolerable.
02:10:14.18 --> 02:10:24.78 So, they did hold the line and recognize that this was not good.
02:10:24.78 --> 02:10:32.30 At the same time, you still got these people that were saying that, look, this is the war.
02:10:32.30 --> 02:10:37.94 And here's a quote from the book, Take By Way of Example of the following.
02:10:37.94 --> 02:10:44.78 The American soldier in an officially sanctioned wrath is a thing so ugly and dangerous that
02:10:44.78 --> 02:10:48.78 it would take a kipling to describe him.
02:10:48.78 --> 02:10:54.10 Not a description of Me lie, but the observation of James H. Blunt a young lieutenant later
02:10:54.10 --> 02:10:59.46 to come later to become a judge on the behavior of troops in the Philippine 60 years before
02:10:59.46 --> 02:11:02.26 Vietnam.
02:11:02.26 --> 02:11:05.70 Here's another comment about what that war was like.
02:11:05.70 --> 02:11:11.06 The war and the Philippines are men have been relentless, have killed to exterminate men,
02:11:11.06 --> 02:11:16.26 women and children, prisoners and captives, active insurgents and suspected people from
02:11:16.26 --> 02:11:24.98 lads of 10 up and idea prevailing that the Filipino was little better than a dog.
02:11:24.98 --> 02:11:32.50 And another comparison here from the book, in the Dakotas, General William to come to Sherman
02:11:32.50 --> 02:11:35.38 had written to General Yuless, you, this is as grand.
02:11:35.38 --> 02:11:43.46 We must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sue, even to the extermination, men, women
02:11:43.46 --> 02:11:44.98 and children.
02:11:44.98 --> 02:11:46.98 Nothing else will reach the root of the case.
02:11:46.98 --> 02:11:50.06 Let's talk about the Indian wars there.
02:11:50.06 --> 02:12:00.42 And then another one, just a description that sort of explains how horrible war is.
02:12:00.42 --> 02:12:02.14 And this one was from World War II.
02:12:02.14 --> 02:12:07.42 What kind of a war to civilian suppose we fought anyways, we shot prisoners and cold blood,
02:12:07.42 --> 02:12:13.26 wiped out hospitals, strafed light, lifeboats, killed or mistreated enemy civilians, finished
02:12:13.26 --> 02:12:17.02 off the enemy wounded, tossed the dying into a hole with the dead.
02:12:17.02 --> 02:12:21.34 And in the Pacific, boiled the flesh off enemy skulls to make table ornaments for sweet
02:12:21.34 --> 02:12:26.42 hearts or carved their bones into letter openers.
02:12:26.42 --> 02:12:35.86 I was written by an American war correspondent, Edward L. Jones.
02:12:35.86 --> 02:12:50.42 Now, where those ideas become so disturbing and again, war is hell, war is dark or is evil,
02:12:50.42 --> 02:12:57.42 horrible things happen.
02:12:57.42 --> 02:13:01.98 And again, when you have a lack of leadership, things get even worse.
02:13:01.98 --> 02:13:08.42 And it can happen even to these apparently normal guys.
02:13:08.42 --> 02:13:14.94 And here's Michael Bernhardt talking about what it was like and what he fought of people
02:13:14.94 --> 02:13:16.26 after he got home.
02:13:16.26 --> 02:13:22.14 I had seen people who looked like everybody else, normal people doing atrocious things.
02:13:22.14 --> 02:13:27.22 And I really wasn't sure how anyone would have acted in the same situation.
02:13:27.22 --> 02:13:29.26 I thought I knew human nature.
02:13:29.26 --> 02:13:32.50 I thought that people were basically good and that they couldn't do this.
02:13:32.50 --> 02:13:36.46 I thought most of the values people held were pretty solid.
02:13:36.46 --> 02:13:42.06 That when we defined things as good or bad, that they were good or bad.
02:13:42.06 --> 02:13:45.66 And that we would know when something was really bad.
02:13:45.66 --> 02:13:49.30 But I had seen that this was not the case.
02:13:49.30 --> 02:13:51.58 I wasn't sure I could trust anyone again.
02:13:51.58 --> 02:13:56.46 I wasn't sure I could ever get close to anyone or confide in anyone very closely because
02:13:56.46 --> 02:14:00.26 of what I'd seen over there.
02:14:00.26 --> 02:14:06.02 And going back to the leadership piece, and this is from the book, what steps were taken
02:14:06.02 --> 02:14:12.78 to halt the run of beatings, thefts, rapes, tortures, and murder, which prodded Charlie
02:14:12.78 --> 02:14:16.78 Company down the road to me lie.
02:14:16.78 --> 02:14:18.50 None.
02:14:18.50 --> 02:14:23.18 Who, among the chain of command that found on its bottom wrongly tenant William Cally and
02:14:23.18 --> 02:14:29.02 rose through Medina, Barker, Henderson, and Costa gave any kind of moral leader example
02:14:29.02 --> 02:14:33.90 that might have prevented the moral destruction of the company.
02:14:33.90 --> 02:14:36.66 No one.
02:14:36.66 --> 02:14:42.06 In place of clear leadership, there was paper leadership.
02:14:42.06 --> 02:14:47.94 The rules of engagement, numerous codes of conduct, and all other directives, all of which
02:14:47.94 --> 02:14:53.18 contained valoftiest intentions.
02:14:53.18 --> 02:14:55.02 There was nothing wrong with these regulations.
02:14:55.02 --> 02:15:00.30 In spirit, they were a recognizable expression of the American ideal at war, a blueprint
02:15:00.30 --> 02:15:04.74 for order in the midst of hell.
02:15:04.74 --> 02:15:11.58 They simply never became part of the soldiers' reality because they weren't never seriously
02:15:11.58 --> 02:15:12.94 enforced.
02:15:12.94 --> 02:15:16.82 And without infatric enforcement, they corresponded as much to the world of the common
02:15:16.82 --> 02:15:24.86 grunt as road maps of Mars.
02:15:24.86 --> 02:15:39.26 That total lack of leadership, that lack of moral courage.
02:15:39.26 --> 02:15:46.38 And as we close this out, it goes in the book here and says, once again, the darker side
02:15:46.38 --> 02:15:49.50 of war has gone underground.
02:15:49.50 --> 02:15:56.50 Eli is no longer a public burden or concern, the burden of guilt and the burden of responsibility
02:15:56.50 --> 02:16:01.34 have fallen onto the soldiers themselves.
02:16:01.34 --> 02:16:10.26 Shit, that men of Charlie Company used to tell each other, rolls downhill.
02:16:10.26 --> 02:16:21.34 And we'll close out with the words from Vernado Simpson, who is in his own little private
02:16:21.34 --> 02:16:27.26 hell with his memories of this as he sits shaking from side to side in his chair, alone
02:16:27.26 --> 02:16:32.70 in his house in Jackson, Mississippi.
02:16:32.70 --> 02:16:35.54 How can you forgive?
02:16:35.54 --> 02:16:39.06 I can't forgive myself for the things.
02:16:39.06 --> 02:16:42.54 Even though I know that it was something that I was told to do, but how can I forget
02:16:42.54 --> 02:16:45.54 that or forgive?
02:16:45.54 --> 02:16:50.66 It's easy for you to say, well, go ahead with your life.
02:16:50.66 --> 02:16:55.86 But how can you go ahead with your life when this is holding you back?
02:16:55.86 --> 02:16:58.02 I can't put my mind to anything.
02:16:58.02 --> 02:17:05.34 Yes, I'm ashamed, I'm sorry, I'm guilty, but I did it.
02:17:05.34 --> 02:17:11.86 You know what else can I tell you.
02:17:11.86 --> 02:17:16.06 It happened.
02:17:16.06 --> 02:17:22.86 It happened.
02:17:22.86 --> 02:17:32.54 And as we think about this book and you should go and get this book and you should read
02:17:32.54 --> 02:17:35.02 this book and you should experience this.
02:17:35.02 --> 02:17:47.26 Level of darkness in the world so that we can all remember to be vigilant against this
02:17:47.26 --> 02:18:00.58 power of darkness, which I suppose we have to admit that that darkness is in every man's
02:18:00.58 --> 02:18:14.78 soul lurking and waiting for a moment to strike out.
02:18:14.78 --> 02:18:35.90 And we need to counter that.
02:18:35.90 --> 02:18:42.78 And you can see in these situations where leaders lead men to do things that they
02:18:42.78 --> 02:18:44.22 knew were wrong.
02:18:44.22 --> 02:18:48.06 They knew they were wrong.
02:18:48.06 --> 02:18:54.54 Things that they didn't want to do, killing children as tears are streaming down their
02:18:54.54 --> 02:18:55.86 faces.
02:18:55.86 --> 02:19:01.54 And if you can lead men to do things that they know are wrong, imagine the power and the
02:19:01.54 --> 02:19:07.94 influence you have as a leader to lead people to do things that are right and that people
02:19:07.94 --> 02:19:14.94 know are right and that are good.
02:19:14.94 --> 02:19:18.02 And you are a leader.
02:19:18.02 --> 02:19:19.38 I am a leader.
02:19:19.38 --> 02:19:26.14 No matter what your station in life or your position or your rank you are a leader when you
02:19:26.14 --> 02:19:32.50 step up and lead you are a leader.
02:19:32.50 --> 02:19:39.14 And you can make a difference and you can have an impact and you can affect the outcomes
02:19:39.14 --> 02:19:54.38 of so many things in the world by stepping up and leading away from the evil and away from
02:19:54.38 --> 02:20:09.34 the darkness and toward the light.
02:20:09.34 --> 02:20:20.74 And I know that was a rough book and it is a rough podcast.
02:20:20.74 --> 02:20:28.42 And I was questioning whether to actually do this or not.
02:20:28.42 --> 02:20:33.62 And at certain points when I was reading this, this is my fourth time reading it.
02:20:33.62 --> 02:20:43.54 I think and even when I was reading it just now on the podcast for this recording I could
02:20:43.54 --> 02:20:50.82 hear a numbness in my voice. I could hear it as I'm talking about the killing and the
02:20:50.82 --> 02:20:57.78 gunning down and it's so much.
02:20:57.78 --> 02:20:59.06 And I know it's going to be brutal.
02:20:59.06 --> 02:21:03.70 I know people are going to be impacted by this and maybe not everyone's going to make
02:21:03.70 --> 02:21:08.26 it through this and I understand that.
02:21:08.26 --> 02:21:19.30 And we owe it to ourselves to know history and to know and understand evil and to understand
02:21:19.30 --> 02:21:26.38 how quickly it can come about and to see these indicators and to know that if you're in the
02:21:26.38 --> 02:21:29.78 leadership position and you start to see things going sideways, you've got to put a stop
02:21:29.78 --> 02:21:38.22 to them before they get out of hand before they turn into this.
02:21:38.22 --> 02:21:51.66 Maybe at some point we'll look for some topics that are a little bit more I guess light
02:21:51.66 --> 02:21:53.50 hard and light harded.
02:21:53.50 --> 02:21:56.70 But I'll tell you the my only issue with that is you want a topic that's light
02:21:56.70 --> 02:21:59.46 harded you can find them anywhere.
02:21:59.46 --> 02:22:00.66 You can go get them anywhere.
02:22:00.66 --> 02:22:06.54 There's a whole actually there's a whole section for a podcast that's called comedy.
02:22:06.54 --> 02:22:07.54 Right?
02:22:07.54 --> 02:22:09.74 It's called comedy that exists.
02:22:09.74 --> 02:22:13.50 There's no section that says the darkness I guess there is one it's called jockel podcast.
02:22:13.50 --> 02:22:14.50 You want to hear about the darkness.
02:22:14.50 --> 02:22:17.74 You want to hear about things that are going on in the world that aren't good.
02:22:17.74 --> 02:22:18.74 This is it.
02:22:18.74 --> 02:22:25.38 And where the people that are dealing with reality and you know I know this is not for
02:22:25.38 --> 02:22:28.14 everybody and that's okay.
02:22:28.14 --> 02:22:29.86 That's okay.
02:22:29.86 --> 02:22:35.46 You know we're talking about heavy topics here and the reason we're talking about the
02:22:35.46 --> 02:22:37.46 dark is because we want to be enlightened.
02:22:37.46 --> 02:22:45.14 We want to know about these things.
02:22:45.14 --> 02:22:49.98 I don't think we're going to have time for Q&A because I just talked about that book for
02:22:49.98 --> 02:22:54.78 a really long time.
02:22:54.78 --> 02:22:59.98 So what we'll do is do a Q&A for the next podcast.
02:22:59.98 --> 02:23:08.14 For this one we'll let it stand on its own.
02:23:08.14 --> 02:23:13.94 And I know it might be a rough podcast to think about wanting to hear more of them.
02:23:13.94 --> 02:23:20.26 But if you do want to hear more of these podcasts echo what can these folks do to support
02:23:20.26 --> 02:23:21.26 the podcasts.
02:23:21.26 --> 02:23:29.66 Well, as I always recommend, sure support the podcast, but you can also support yourself.
02:23:29.66 --> 02:23:38.34 With supplementation on it has the best supplements, the actual supplements that I take.
02:23:38.34 --> 02:23:42.58 Jocquitakes on it.com slash jockel.
02:23:42.58 --> 02:23:44.06 You can get 10% off.
02:23:44.06 --> 02:23:49.10 So support yourself physically and financially in that way.
02:23:49.10 --> 02:23:51.94 I would recommend what do you think.
02:23:51.94 --> 02:23:55.38 Well, what's the number one you think?
02:23:55.38 --> 02:24:02.38 I think it depends on who you are.
02:24:02.38 --> 02:24:05.38 I think if you're me, it's cruel.
02:24:05.38 --> 02:24:06.82 Yeah, and they're just doing anyway.
02:24:06.82 --> 02:24:09.82 So Alphabran, good for you, brain, makes you think quicker.
02:24:09.82 --> 02:24:12.78 Makes you like, you know, you just say Alphabran because I got how soft I'm ready
02:24:12.78 --> 02:24:13.78 for it.
02:24:13.78 --> 02:24:17.54 As Jocquit drinks Alphabran instant by the way.
02:24:17.54 --> 02:24:20.66 Makes you think, you know, like when you search for words, like in your, you know, when
02:24:20.66 --> 02:24:23.10 you're trying to think of a word, sometimes.
02:24:23.10 --> 02:24:24.10 Yes.
02:24:24.10 --> 02:24:28.34 Well, you feel like you leave the pathways to the words a little bit closer.
02:24:28.34 --> 02:24:29.34 Yeah.
02:24:29.34 --> 02:24:30.34 Yeah.
02:24:30.34 --> 02:24:31.78 If you want to get it, you actually can read all about it.
02:24:31.78 --> 02:24:33.50 It's called a neutral pick Alphabran.
02:24:33.50 --> 02:24:34.50 Yes.
02:24:34.50 --> 02:24:35.50 Good for you, brain.
02:24:35.50 --> 02:24:38.82 Anyway, cruel oil, good for you, joins us when Jocquitakes.
02:24:38.82 --> 02:24:40.74 That's why he's so functional.
02:24:40.74 --> 02:24:43.02 I would say, relax a bit at our professional.
02:24:43.02 --> 02:24:46.22 I like that word.
02:24:46.22 --> 02:24:48.10 And warrior bars.
02:24:48.10 --> 02:24:50.46 That's the new one right there, the warrior bars.
02:24:50.46 --> 02:24:54.06 That's not like some, you know, they've been having, well, actually,
02:24:54.06 --> 02:24:56.66 it's pretty neat too, but you know, you have protein powder.
02:24:56.66 --> 02:24:57.66 That's been around.
02:24:57.66 --> 02:25:00.10 But warrior bar, that's a new twist on things.
02:25:00.10 --> 02:25:02.46 Well, what's good about, what's good about, like you talk about protein
02:25:02.46 --> 02:25:03.46 powder?
02:25:03.46 --> 02:25:04.46 That's like a powder, right?
02:25:04.46 --> 02:25:05.46 Or you get a protein bar.
02:25:05.46 --> 02:25:07.46 That's a thing that's been manufactured.
02:25:07.46 --> 02:25:08.46 Right.
02:25:08.46 --> 02:25:09.46 Like a power.
02:25:09.46 --> 02:25:10.46 Yeah.
02:25:10.46 --> 02:25:11.46 The warrior bar is like food.
02:25:11.46 --> 02:25:12.46 Yeah.
02:25:12.46 --> 02:25:13.46 Yeah.
02:25:13.46 --> 02:25:15.06 So that makes it a little bit better in my mind.
02:25:15.06 --> 02:25:16.06 Yes.
02:25:16.06 --> 02:25:17.06 Because I want to make food.
02:25:17.06 --> 02:25:18.06 Yeah.
02:25:18.06 --> 02:25:23.06 So it's kind of like in the direction of a beef jerky situation, but even more.
02:25:23.06 --> 02:25:24.46 Anyway, look, look at it.
02:25:24.46 --> 02:25:27.82 The thing is, well, there's two, there's two major differences between beef jerky
02:25:27.82 --> 02:25:28.58 and warrior bar.
02:25:28.58 --> 02:25:31.14 And that is beef jerky dry.
02:25:31.14 --> 02:25:32.62 Warrior bar, not dry.
02:25:32.62 --> 02:25:33.62 Yeah.
02:25:33.62 --> 02:25:34.62 That's the list.
02:25:34.62 --> 02:25:39.70 And then a shrimp tech, good for like high intensity kind of prolong stuff.
02:25:39.70 --> 02:25:43.70 Gigiitsu, if you're into it wrestling, metcon, metcon, metcon, or.
02:25:43.70 --> 02:25:44.70 You're in a crossfit.
02:25:44.70 --> 02:25:45.70 There you go.
02:25:45.70 --> 02:25:46.70 A shrimp tech boom.
02:25:46.70 --> 02:25:47.70 Yeah.
02:25:47.70 --> 02:25:49.26 Improve your output, your performance.
02:25:49.26 --> 02:25:51.06 Utilize oxygen better.
02:25:51.06 --> 02:25:53.46 Anyway, it's really good.
02:25:53.46 --> 02:25:54.62 It's like really good.
02:25:54.62 --> 02:25:57.54 Also another way to support the podcast if you're in the mood to.
02:25:57.54 --> 02:26:02.94 Before you do your Amazon shopping, go to japkopadcast.com and click on the Amazon link.
02:26:02.94 --> 02:26:04.42 What is that cost you?
02:26:04.42 --> 02:26:08.94 That doesn't cost you anything except for literally, literally, three seconds.
02:26:08.94 --> 02:26:09.94 So you're in time.
02:26:09.94 --> 02:26:11.30 Three seconds and you support the podcast.
02:26:11.30 --> 02:26:12.30 Yep.
02:26:12.30 --> 02:26:13.30 I like that.
02:26:13.30 --> 02:26:14.30 And one like a click.
02:26:14.30 --> 02:26:15.94 Maybe like a one tenth of a calorie.
02:26:15.94 --> 02:26:16.94 Maybe you finger click.
02:26:16.94 --> 02:26:17.94 I like that.
02:26:17.94 --> 02:26:18.94 But yeah, super easy.
02:26:18.94 --> 02:26:21.42 The main thing is we're asking people to donate money there.
02:26:21.42 --> 02:26:22.42 No, no, no.
02:26:22.42 --> 02:26:24.62 We just Amazon's gonna donate the money.
02:26:24.62 --> 02:26:25.62 Yeah.
02:26:25.62 --> 02:26:27.26 They're gonna support the podcast.
02:26:27.26 --> 02:26:28.26 Like, collect it.
02:26:28.26 --> 02:26:29.26 Yeah, it's good.
02:26:29.26 --> 02:26:31.26 So boom, there you go.
02:26:31.26 --> 02:26:35.02 I guess the main thing is to remember to do it.
02:26:35.02 --> 02:26:37.74 You know, when you're trying to get that duct tape real quick, oh, I got to make that
02:26:37.74 --> 02:26:40.94 time so you can ship that same day.
02:26:40.94 --> 02:26:42.46 You know, then you got to just want it.
02:26:42.46 --> 02:26:44.82 Maybe take some alpha brain that'll help you remember.
02:26:44.82 --> 02:26:45.82 I like that.
02:26:45.82 --> 02:26:46.82 Anyway.
02:26:46.82 --> 02:26:50.62 You want some jocos stuff, like some cool shirts, jocosdoor.com.
02:26:50.62 --> 02:26:52.26 Now this, I'm seeing a new shirt.
02:26:52.26 --> 02:26:53.50 Is that correct here?
02:26:53.50 --> 02:26:56.66 Yes, we have a new shirt, the trooper shirt.
02:26:56.66 --> 02:26:58.22 That's, it's got a name.
02:26:58.22 --> 02:26:59.50 Are we naming shirts now?
02:26:59.50 --> 02:27:01.14 Because the guy is over there.
02:27:01.14 --> 02:27:02.30 We have to name it.
02:27:02.30 --> 02:27:06.42 So this is some people don't echo Charles.
02:27:06.42 --> 02:27:08.86 He is an artist, right?
02:27:08.86 --> 02:27:10.02 He's an artist.
02:27:10.02 --> 02:27:13.14 And so that's why he has to name the t-shirt.
02:27:13.14 --> 02:27:14.14 Yeah.
02:27:14.14 --> 02:27:16.78 You know, you just have to name it because that makes you feel like it's a piece.
02:27:16.78 --> 02:27:17.78 It's a piece of art.
02:27:17.78 --> 02:27:22.54 Because you just said the trooper shirt.
02:27:22.54 --> 02:27:24.02 As if that's the thing.
02:27:24.02 --> 02:27:28.30 But here's the thing, though, with this shirt and with all the shirts, it's not just,
02:27:28.30 --> 02:27:31.10 oh, I'm going to call it the trooper shirt because I think that sounds cool.
02:27:31.10 --> 02:27:33.82 It's like there's different lace, not just a shirt with a saying line.
02:27:33.82 --> 02:27:34.82 Like this blue equals.
02:27:34.82 --> 02:27:35.82 It's not just your saying.
02:27:35.82 --> 02:27:37.94 It's not just called the trooper t-shirt.
02:27:37.94 --> 02:27:39.94 It actually is the trooper shirt.
02:27:39.94 --> 02:27:40.94 Yeah.
02:27:40.94 --> 02:27:41.94 Like where you're coming.
02:27:41.94 --> 02:27:42.94 And you're wearing it right now.
02:27:42.94 --> 02:27:45.10 If you want to see the side of you too, you can check it out.
02:27:45.10 --> 02:27:47.50 But three colors, that's a unique one.
02:27:47.50 --> 02:27:48.50 Usually you have two colors.
02:27:48.50 --> 02:27:50.62 Normally I would protest something like that.
02:27:50.62 --> 02:27:52.82 No, but you can't protest it and this is why.
02:27:52.82 --> 02:28:00.18 So the people who signed up on the insider's group, the email list, I, people that
02:28:00.18 --> 02:28:01.50 are enlisted troopers.
02:28:01.50 --> 02:28:02.50 You know, of Jockel podcast.
02:28:02.50 --> 02:28:03.50 Thanks, guys.
02:28:03.50 --> 02:28:04.50 Yeah, it's all.
02:28:04.50 --> 02:28:06.50 Well, how do they do that?
02:28:06.50 --> 02:28:10.42 Well, on JockelStore.com, Ryan the front, you just put your email address.
02:28:10.42 --> 02:28:11.74 And I don't spam.
02:28:11.74 --> 02:28:12.74 That's not what it's for.
02:28:12.74 --> 02:28:13.74 This is what it's for.
02:28:13.74 --> 02:28:17.06 The things that it was for and the people who are on the list know this.
02:28:17.06 --> 02:28:25.94 Where hey, I got a new shirt design idea, you know, I don't know what colors really
02:28:25.94 --> 02:28:26.94 did.
02:28:26.94 --> 02:28:27.94 What are the best colors, right?
02:28:27.94 --> 02:28:28.94 I know what colors I like.
02:28:28.94 --> 02:28:30.66 Yeah, I'll do a black one.
02:28:30.66 --> 02:28:31.66 I'll do.
02:28:31.66 --> 02:28:36.06 But so what I did was I sent an email to everybody and said, what, here's the design.
02:28:36.06 --> 02:28:37.82 Here's what it kind of will look like.
02:28:37.82 --> 02:28:39.30 What color shirts are we doing?
02:28:39.30 --> 02:28:40.30 What color shirts do you guys like?
02:28:40.30 --> 02:28:43.98 So there's a, there was a vote that was input received.
02:28:43.98 --> 02:28:47.58 Yes, yeah, like a, yeah, and a consensus was these three colors.
02:28:47.58 --> 02:28:49.26 It's like a dark red.
02:28:49.26 --> 02:28:52.46 Oh, which actually turned out even better than I thought.
02:28:52.46 --> 02:28:58.90 And I was enthusiastic about the red and the OD green support OD green.
02:28:58.90 --> 02:29:02.34 That way if you have to, you never know when you might have to go tactical.
02:29:02.34 --> 02:29:03.34 It is tactical.
02:29:03.34 --> 02:29:05.54 I'm into doing purpose things.
02:29:05.54 --> 02:29:10.26 Things that can be good for normal situations or tactical situations.
02:29:10.26 --> 02:29:12.14 That's why like OD green t-shirts.
02:29:12.14 --> 02:29:15.70 Yeah, just in case you get a spring into getting after it.
02:29:15.70 --> 02:29:16.70 Spontaneous.
02:29:16.70 --> 02:29:19.62 And then of course we got the black, but that was the consensus overall.
02:29:19.62 --> 02:29:20.62 The green.
02:29:20.62 --> 02:29:24.54 There was a charcoal head of strong, strong, you know.
02:29:24.54 --> 02:29:27.90 But the, the, the green, the red and the black.
02:29:27.90 --> 02:29:29.10 But anyway, yeah, it's a cool one.
02:29:29.10 --> 02:29:31.74 Check it out if you want to look at the details of it.
02:29:31.74 --> 02:29:33.58 They're, yeah, they're good.
02:29:33.58 --> 02:29:36.90 Anyway, if you want to support the podcast that way, get a shirt.
02:29:36.90 --> 02:29:38.50 This trooper shirt isn't the only one.
02:29:38.50 --> 02:29:42.90 But man, I, I'm pretty, I'm pretty fired up about it.
02:29:42.90 --> 02:29:43.90 It looks good.
02:29:43.90 --> 02:29:44.90 I think.
02:29:44.90 --> 02:29:47.58 Anyway, there's other ones on there too that are cool.
02:29:47.58 --> 02:29:50.70 And coffee mugs and stickers.
02:29:50.70 --> 02:29:51.70 If you're down.
02:29:51.70 --> 02:29:52.70 I like that.
02:29:52.70 --> 02:29:53.70 That's the way.
02:29:53.70 --> 02:29:54.70 Those are the ways.
02:29:54.70 --> 02:30:01.46 And for the people who have been and do, thank to say thank you would be like, not even
02:30:01.46 --> 02:30:03.02 doing it halfway just this.
02:30:03.02 --> 02:30:06.14 Yeah, definitely thanks everyone for doing that.
02:30:06.14 --> 02:30:08.14 And you know, you know what's weird.
02:30:08.14 --> 02:30:13.86 You always talk about like how, oh, you go to see the, you got to see the dark to, to appreciate
02:30:13.86 --> 02:30:15.82 the light, right?
02:30:15.82 --> 02:30:22.26 I actually just because we just got done with that dark, dark darkness of a book in just
02:30:22.26 --> 02:30:23.66 having a conversation right now.
02:30:23.66 --> 02:30:24.66 I'm so happy.
02:30:24.66 --> 02:30:25.66 Right.
02:30:25.66 --> 02:30:31.34 Just to be like here and talking and we're, we're selling some cool t shirts and drinking
02:30:31.34 --> 02:30:35.26 some just to be just in this situation.
02:30:35.26 --> 02:30:40.02 And know that we have this goodness around us is, uh, is really good.
02:30:40.02 --> 02:30:46.22 So I think it is worth venturing into the dark so that you can appreciate the light.
02:30:46.22 --> 02:30:51.66 If you want to hear more of this kind of things, obviously you got the podcast.
02:30:51.66 --> 02:30:56.86 You can also pick up a book written by myself and my brother, Lave Babin.
02:30:56.86 --> 02:30:59.18 It's called Extreme Ownership.
02:30:59.18 --> 02:31:02.90 You can buy the book or you can buy the audio book, which is actually Lave and I reading
02:31:02.90 --> 02:31:03.90 it.
02:31:03.90 --> 02:31:09.90 You'll get some more information in there and that's everything I talk about is, is in
02:31:09.90 --> 02:31:10.90 that book.
02:31:10.90 --> 02:31:13.94 I mean, that's, that's, it's the basic principles of combat leadership that we put
02:31:13.94 --> 02:31:14.94 in there.
02:31:14.94 --> 02:31:20.50 Let me add one thing about, it's, it's extreme, that book, extreme ownership.
02:31:20.50 --> 02:31:21.50 It's good.
02:31:21.50 --> 02:31:22.50 It's like dang.
02:31:22.50 --> 02:31:23.94 This is, you fit a lot of the, everyone's different.
02:31:23.94 --> 02:31:29.34 But me, I felt like more than adult after like incorporating these, like the, but
02:31:29.34 --> 02:31:34.34 here's the thing that you do take away is the people around you will notice that you're
02:31:34.34 --> 02:31:37.02 a, like, better person to be around.
02:31:37.02 --> 02:31:42.14 And I thought I was like pretty nice anyway, but you'll feel people like gravitating
02:31:42.14 --> 02:31:47.62 towards you more because like any abrasion, and everyone has varying levels of abrasiveness
02:31:47.62 --> 02:31:48.62 in them.
02:31:48.62 --> 02:31:51.50 Even if it's just a teeny tiny little bit, everyone has some.
02:31:51.50 --> 02:31:59.02 But what that does, it, it, it makes you work with people in a way less abrasive way.
02:31:59.02 --> 02:32:03.66 So people want to be around you when things go now.
02:32:03.66 --> 02:32:07.02 I would say that's, that's a very good assessment.
02:32:07.02 --> 02:32:12.10 And I'll tell you that I always felt, especially when I was in the, when I was in the military,
02:32:12.10 --> 02:32:17.22 in the seal teams, when, when I was doing something, people wanted to come with me.
02:32:17.22 --> 02:32:18.22 I know.
02:32:18.22 --> 02:32:19.22 Yeah, it was all good.
02:32:19.22 --> 02:32:20.70 We all wanted to get after it together.
02:32:20.70 --> 02:32:21.70 Yeah.
02:32:21.70 --> 02:32:27.22 So that's probably an indicator of the principles in the book at work in my life.
02:32:27.22 --> 02:32:28.22 Yeah.
02:32:28.22 --> 02:32:33.98 And some people, I mean, I don't know, maybe us whatever, where, you know, you'll have
02:32:33.98 --> 02:32:40.34 a little, small little conflict or a little something, little friction with somebody.
02:32:40.34 --> 02:32:41.34 Confident.
02:32:41.34 --> 02:32:44.10 Maybe I'll work or even at home or whatever.
02:32:44.10 --> 02:32:46.46 I would say it's, it's pretty rare.
02:32:46.46 --> 02:32:50.50 Like, I'm not, like, if there was some friction that came up between me and anyone,
02:32:50.50 --> 02:32:54.98 even at my friend, my wife or something, he would stand out so much nowadays.
02:32:54.98 --> 02:32:55.98 Yeah.
02:32:55.98 --> 02:32:58.02 It's got become a better person.
02:32:58.02 --> 02:32:59.02 Yeah.
02:32:59.02 --> 02:33:00.02 You become a better person.
02:33:00.02 --> 02:33:06.10 Yeah, and that's at the end, but like I said, it's like, if you, if you follow it, if you
02:33:06.10 --> 02:33:12.36 are like, dang, I value this and I'm going to actually incorporate it.
02:33:12.36 --> 02:33:18.18 As time goes on, that's how it is where if you get friction or some adversarial situation,
02:33:18.18 --> 02:33:24.74 even if it's not yours, you're like, dang, I see that from a mile away, and it sticks out.
02:33:24.74 --> 02:33:27.82 So it's not, I mean, some people, it's part of their everyday thing.
02:33:27.82 --> 02:33:28.82 Yeah, no, no.
02:33:28.82 --> 02:33:30.82 It's road rage or I don't know anything.
02:33:30.82 --> 02:33:31.82 Yeah.
02:33:31.82 --> 02:33:32.82 But it's, yeah, it's good, man.
02:33:32.82 --> 02:33:33.82 It's good like that.
02:33:33.82 --> 02:33:34.82 Well, thanks.

02:34:05.26 --> 02:34:07.06 I'm going to see how long I can keep that up for.
02:34:07.06 --> 02:34:08.62 I don't know how long it's going to last.
02:34:08.62 --> 02:34:12.10 It's getting pretty hard core right now.
02:34:12.10 --> 02:34:17.58 But I'm definitely reading everything that's coming in and we appreciate all the feedback
02:34:17.58 --> 02:34:23.02 we get from you guys and you guys bring it a little light to our world as much appreciated.
