but no I thoroughly enjoyed it uh lifelong friends there and just keep me to a story the two guys that were flying uh the uh Boeing's in secoreski dear friends one of them was an naval academy classmate and he and i flew in Vietnam and uh the other guy Greek is just a wonderful guy and still a lifelong close friend well duck uh was unfortunately fortunately for uh Hughes became their chief test pilot uh he got out of the navy and was uh flying for Hughes and was killed in uh in a horrible uh accident and Greek and uh uh sort of sort of close ranks and uh decided that uh we were going to uh try and send uh duck off in good stead To essentially the same with, uh, with our 50s, uh, they, uh, mounted that so that it, uh, would, uh, uh, fire, uh, 90 degrees, uh, longitudinally, and that was a, uh, a very powerful weapon for not only, uh, uh, keeping, uh, keeping guys down, but also, uh, gave us a, uh, a great degree of flexibility in the, in the, in the break. yeah then uh what was it like um was it standard Vietnam where just replacements would come when it was time for a guy to rotate out a new guy would show up pretty much like I mentioned earlier I was sort of kind of drift at the uh an apple of so tell and happened to run into uh got weird Harold who you referenced in that wolf gram he uh came just walking through uh with uh the uh death 401c uh Colonel Hammond we called him currently was a navy commander and uh uh Dave introduced us and said hey this is a great guy we should have him and as a turns out they had an opening and uh within a matter of a few days I was in debt Uh, eventually this group, uh, got, uh, some miniguns, most of all of our, uh, dead birds eventually, uh, had, uh, miniguns and the guys in the back would, uh, fly them and it, uh, did wonders for, uh, keeping, uh, keeping heads down as did the, uh, 50 cows that, uh, that we had. any protocol that you guys set up was there anything that you guys did to to try and take that on board and then move past it I probably missed out on a leadership opportunity and when guys got killed uh and other deaths in combat or even just uh ferrying an aircraft in for maintenance I didn't sit down with the guys and talk about it I internalized it and being Irish would reflect on all the good times we had didn't think about uh what what went wrong didn't want to know initially you know eventually you do because it's important for uh for your trade that uh I just think about the good times that we we shared together I lost a couple of the catamacross classmates I lost some great friends that I made while I was in country uh when you unfelling I don't want to mention any names but he and I were both bicyclists and the one thing that he wanted to do when he got back home was build himself the pre-mo bike and uh start to start competing and he never got that opportunity and when you when you personalize something like that when you think about the opportunities that are lost in a heartbeat it makes you very thankful to be alive it makes you very thankful of the two of known that person and it makes you feel like you should redouble your efforts to get the sons of bitches that took that life away from them. So the army was, uh, uh, uh, a, uh, a, a, a temp into a work with them there, where all sorts of, uh, a minor operational, uh, problemist overcome, uh, who's calling out the missions, uh, uh, uh, what, uh, the support area is, it's just wasn't working well. And perhaps I should explain, uh, that by the break, uh, we typically would fly in a, uh, in the wagon wheel type, uh, uh, type approach, uh, two helicopters, uh, roughly, uh, flying, uh, 180 out from, uh, one another. So the Navy decided that, uh, we needed a Navy squadron and they turned to HC1, the fleet angels, uh, to put, put a few deaths in place, to help provide cover for the, uh, the brown water navy and by brown water navy, I mean the, uh, small boat guys, the seals, any Navy, navy, uh, uh, uh, vessel that was down in the, uh, in the, in the me column. it it wasn't a primary mission of ours if somebody got shot up and uh needed to lift out the town we'd provide that and occasionally we'd uh get a call that uh someone was uh wounded and uh we'd go out and pick him up but generally that was a job that was done by some certifiable idiots that I love the uh the dust soft pilots you got uh 2019 20 year old kids that are out there given the keys to uh a mazorati Chris this was only a Huey and I think that that quote just really exemplifies the the bond between seals and sea wolves and like I said it was something that I heard about as a young seal and it's a bond that still exists when when I talk to the Vietnam seals and it's a bond that's uh that's always going to be there and um all into that do you have any uh you know like I said we've been at it for a while and I like I like I told you before we started I could sit else in here I could sit here to listen to you all day but uh do you have any other you know any other closing thoughts that you want to that you want to mention uh hand salute to the 44 that didn't make it back with us uh anyone who hasn't been to the wall anybody who served who hasn't been to the wall you ought to make that trip a shout out again I hope I'm not going in the too many sea stories but that great friend about the only guy at names I'm using your guys who were just ceased but that huge canis was a copilot and we were set off to uh for uh to uh to Guam for some uh specialized training and he and I are there in our uh in our uh poopy suits at the bar the O'Claub bar at the Air Force base on Guam and we're in enjoying a couple of beers which tasted good and all of a sudden this bell rings like crazy and income these guys in pressed flight suits with ass gotts and everybody in the bar all the Air Force guys are standing at attention this B52 crew coming back from a mission and we're just sitting there with Air elbows on the bar and the crowd didn't know what to make of us so uh if you're familiar with San Diego now you know about the point luma lighthouse and the area up there that's where the family was waiting Hughes had given us a uh 500 to uh scatter the remains in uh that Greek took it upon himself to do this now at this time he probably had uh 2500 flytars he knew his way around the helicopter he's in his navy blues he gets in the aircraft he's got the cremeins in his lap and they're flying out along well below uh the uh the point on on out over the ocean and he looks up and sees the family up there yes we were the only uh uh helicopter out there that wasn't on the large gray boats to actually fly the mission that could provide combat search and rescue uh so uh we took full advantage of that uh got the uh armament that we thought we passing through Guam uh I didn't like the side arm I had and uh you're expected to add an old figuratively put your boots up on the table one day I got so pissed off the middle of the morning I uh jumped in my Corvette remember that uh hey I learned I learned jumped in my Corvette and uh uh Toran up to uh Coronado and two of the seals that we operated with friends uh were there and I walked into the office they had their LSDs pulled up face to face Uh, so, uh, the, uh, the nine deaths to helicopters in each, uh, each, uh, Huey was, uh, basically configured with two seven shot rocket pods, uh, 2.75 folding thin aerial rockets. but yeah there was a lot of uh beer and other things that were drank and and I don't know you know there's it was sort of uh it was sort of it seemed like the the normal thing to do I don't know it seemed like we were gonna kind of get it out of our systems for a little while and you know um get over it because it is it is you know it's not that big of a deal I don't want to make it sound like it's all crazy I feel the same way about the uh the uh C wolves and this might be a bad good time to uh share with you the fact that uh I at one time after a returning from Vietnam was so fed up with the mission that we were flying it was an aging aircraft it didn't have systems that were required to do the job the the uh job itself uh was not that important I mean really uh you're you're flying an over water mission and you need to sell any and ever can tell it's always good to be prepared but at any rate uh we'd go out there and uh and just train for that uh when we weren't actually out there in in support of the uh the the boats uh we've gotten a train for that you end up doing your 20 years um That was a great good thing, but it also, uh, resulted in brassing, uh, the uh, sink elevator and the, uh, uh, uh, it just wasn't really, really acceptable. The, uh, Army had took that mission on first, actually flying off a couple of, uh, uh, LCDs, uh, that were, uh, rigged with a, uh, makeshift flight tech. they'd convinced me that uh uh being a a peacetime seal uh wasn't uh everything that uh that I would expect and that they uh the navy had put an awful lot of investment into making me what I was and I could make them far better contribution by continuing to fly So, uh, as you've already mentioned, on April Fool's Day, in uh, 67, uh, they decided that the, uh, in country squadron was, uh, required and, uh, that responsibility was shifted from HC1 to Hal-3. It's a rough ride going back in, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, they decided that, no, we can't have that. an over cautious manner we didn't have anyone that uh was sent back to the to the rear there was a camaraderie that you just can't explain to somebody who hasn't enjoyed it it's uh it's an honor to serve with people like that and we all took pride in our reputations among our our squadron mates so it wasn't hard to go and and that was so clear it when you watch scramble to see wolves it's so clear and there's this incredible um they you can see the camaraderie and you can hear it when you read through the the the wolf grams you can see that guys are having a good time and there's this I mean what what I would consider and you can tell me if I'm wrong but like a peer pressure of hey we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna do this you know I've I've often said that when you get to a good seal platoon it's not a team it's not a platoon it's like a gang that you're a it's a gang yeah there's ways you uh you accommodate that uh uh i always think of the great good times that uh that duck and uh Greek and I had together and I mis-im-sure I I should share with you that uh as a technical person I have developed what I call rallies theorem and rallies theorem says that all the truly great ladies hook up with all the truly big buffoons and stinky if you're out there listening I sure am glad that you did that love you more than pork chops maybe and uh well also thanks your son Sean for uh for connecting us and when he came up and asked me he said oh gee would you have us you will find your podcast I'm like uh let me think about that for point two seconds absolutely so um yeah thanks to Sean for for connecting us well they had determined that I was going to bring stinky on down uh for lunch I picked her up in Tanzanute and bring her on down so they had that place spit shot I don't know they did it if it was already it turned out to be a bit of a disappointment uh we uh flew a flu helicopter on up to Tanzanute and you know we're going over uh bad guy country and I put it out to him that we already had and that we're just waiting for uh uh the arrival and uh we solve the problem by saying uh listen this aircraft is armed what did you stay here and watch it for us and uh we'll just be a little while so we walked on over this big old green brand of jet comes on in And, uh, it wasn't working well with the, uh, the army HC1 picked it up, but started working very well, uh, because they understood the Navy's mission much better than the army, and they were, uh, equipped with the, uh, capabilities to fly both at night and in bad weather. We had, uh, a pair of, uh, 60s that were mounted with a flex gun, the copilot control those, but the, uh, the thing that really made us, uh, uh, unique and powerful was our door gunners. Uh, the, the army was just getting rid of their Bravo models to go to this, uh, two of the Charlie's, which had, uh, several hundred, uh, greater horsepower, a more maneuverable, a blah, blah, blah, and they had, uh, some old Bravo sitting around and rather than shipping them back to the Boneyard or destroying them in place, they gave them to the Navy. And, uh, sort of tied the gunner's hands by, uh, putting what they called a pussy pole in the, uh, in the, in the door and, uh, mounted the, uh, the 62.
