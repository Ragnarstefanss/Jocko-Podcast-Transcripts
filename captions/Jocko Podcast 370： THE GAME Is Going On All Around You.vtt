00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.64
This is Jocko podcast number 370 with echo Charles and me jockel willing good evening echo good evening

2
00:00:05.68 --> 00:00:12.04
So if you are listening and you didn't listen to the last podcast number 369 go back and listen to it

3
00:00:12.04 --> 00:00:15.08
This is a continuation of that podcast

4
00:00:16.16 --> 00:00:20.24
We are talking about the games. We are playing

5
00:00:21.24 --> 00:00:22.46
the

6
00:00:22.46 --> 00:00:29.56
Abordinate games that make up various aspects of life and then ultimately the game of life itself and

7
00:00:33.56 --> 00:00:37.44
Just to say this and we kind of talked about this on the last one

8
00:00:38.40 --> 00:00:40.08
recognition of

9
00:00:40.08 --> 00:00:42.40
the game is a

10
00:00:43.04 --> 00:00:48.44
Huge part of the battle just recognizing that there's a game going on is a huge part of the battle. It's like

11
00:00:48.44 --> 00:00:54.92
When people are alcoholics and sort of the the beginning of solving the problem is admitting

12
00:00:54.92 --> 00:00:57.96
Oh, I'm an alcoholic. That's what they say or realizing

13
00:00:59.40 --> 00:01:01.60
That you've been hustled in in pool

14
00:01:02.56 --> 00:01:05.80
Right, like like you don't know that you're getting hustled. Yeah

15
00:01:06.44 --> 00:01:08.44
They're playing a game with you

16
00:01:08.72 --> 00:01:14.44
You you will you'll literally stop getting hustled as soon as you recognize what's happening a three card the three card shuffle

17
00:01:14.44 --> 00:01:16.44
You ever seen that? Yeah

18
00:01:16.44 --> 00:01:19.20
The you think you're gonna win that game

19
00:01:19.72 --> 00:01:24.28
They're playing a game. They're playing a different game than you are. You're trying to watch that card like an idiot

20
00:01:26.08 --> 00:01:31.52
Hey, you realize someone's playing you in a relationship, right? That's a common term

21
00:01:31.64 --> 00:01:35.64
We don't talk about the game, but we talk about getting played and getting played. Yeah

22
00:01:36.04 --> 00:01:41.60
Once you know, you're getting played. Hopefully you go. Oh, okay. Now. I understand the game. That's happening

23
00:01:41.60 --> 00:01:43.60
I'm losing the game. I'm gonna get out of the game. Yeah

24
00:01:43.60 --> 00:01:46.76
If you don't know there's a game going on you're just gonna lose the game

25
00:01:47.48 --> 00:01:48.44
so

26
00:01:48.44 --> 00:01:55.16
That's kind of the the prime primary piece of information from the last podcast was to make sure you know

27
00:01:55.16 --> 00:01:57.16
You are in a game

28
00:01:59.52 --> 00:02:06.48
I'm gonna go back to David Foster Wallace's commencement speech which I talked a little bit about on the last podcast

29
00:02:06.48 --> 00:02:08.48
Here's another excerpt

30
00:02:09.68 --> 00:02:11.68
He says this by way of example

31
00:02:11.68 --> 00:02:15.12
Let's say it's an average adult day and you get up in the morning

32
00:02:15.36 --> 00:02:21.08
Go to your challenging white collar college graduate job and you work hard for eight or ten hours

33
00:02:21.08 --> 00:02:23.64
And at the end of the day, you're tired and somewhat stressed

34
00:02:23.64 --> 00:02:29.16
And all you want to do is go home and have a good supper and maybe unwind for an hour and then hit the sack early

35
00:02:29.16 --> 00:02:32.64
Because of course you have to get up the next day and do it all again

36
00:02:33.68 --> 00:02:35.36
But then you remember there's no food at home

37
00:02:35.36 --> 00:02:38.04
You haven't had time to shop this week because of your challenging job

38
00:02:38.04 --> 00:02:41.92
So now after work you have to get in your car and drive to the supermarket

39
00:02:41.92 --> 00:02:46.36
It's the end of the work day and the traffic is apt to be very bad

40
00:02:47.68 --> 00:02:52.40
So getting to the store takes way longer than it should and when you finally get there the supermarket is very crowded

41
00:02:52.40 --> 00:02:57.40
Because of course it's the time of day when all the other people with jobs also try and squeeze in some grocery shopping

42
00:02:57.76 --> 00:02:59.76
And the store is hiddily hideously lit

43
00:03:01.08 --> 00:03:06.08
And also infused with soul-killing muzak or corporate pop and it's pretty much the same

44
00:03:06.08 --> 00:03:12.08
Or corporate pop and it's pretty much the last place you want to be but you can't just get in and out quickly

45
00:03:12.08 --> 00:03:14.08
You have to wander all over the huge

46
00:03:14.44 --> 00:03:15.72
Overlit stores

47
00:03:15.72 --> 00:03:21.96
Confusing aisles to find the stuff you want and you have to maneuver your junkie cart through all these other tired

48
00:03:22.04 --> 00:03:24.44
hurried people with carts etc etc

49
00:03:24.92 --> 00:03:29.32
Cutting stuff out because of the long ceremony here and eventually you get

50
00:03:29.84 --> 00:03:34.28
All your supper supplies except now it turns out that there aren't enough checkout lanes open

51
00:03:34.28 --> 00:03:40.52
Even though it's the end of the day rush so the checkout line is incredibly long which is stupid and infuriating

52
00:03:41.72 --> 00:03:46.36
But you can't take your frustration out on the lady on the frantic lady working the register

53
00:03:46.36 --> 00:03:49.72
Who's overworked at a job whose daily tedium and meaninglessness

54
00:03:50.56 --> 00:03:55.12
Surpasses the imagination of any of us here at a prestigious college, but anyway

55
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.44
You finally get to the checkout lines front and you pay for your food

56
00:03:59.44 --> 00:04:03.28
And you get told to have a nice day in a voice that is absolutely the voice of death

57
00:04:03.28 --> 00:04:11.68
Then you have to take your creepy flimsy plastic bags of groceries in your cart with the one crazy wheel that pulls

58
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.66
Mattingly lead to the left all the way through the crowded bumpy

59
00:04:15.92 --> 00:04:23.24
Literary parking lot and then you have to drive all the way home through slow heavy SUV intensive rush hour traffic

60
00:04:23.24 --> 00:04:29.76
Etc etc everyone has done this of course, but it hasn't been part of your graduates actual life routine

61
00:04:29.76 --> 00:04:35.000
Day after day week after week month after month year after year

62
00:04:36.44 --> 00:04:38.44
But it will be

63
00:04:38.88 --> 00:04:47.36
And many more dreary annoying seemingly meaningless routines besides but that is not the point the point is

64
00:04:48.96 --> 00:04:55.52
That petty frustrating crap like this is exactly where the work of choosing is

65
00:04:56.12 --> 00:04:58.12
gonna come in

66
00:04:58.12 --> 00:05:05.20
Because the traffic jams and crowded aisles and long checkout lines give me time to think and if I don't make a conscious

67
00:05:05.32 --> 00:05:12.24
Decision about how to think and what to pay attention to I'm gonna be pissed and miserable every time

68
00:05:12.24 --> 00:05:20.72
I have to shop because my natural default setting is the certainty that situations like this are really all about me

69
00:05:22.24 --> 00:05:23.56
about my

70
00:05:23.56 --> 00:05:30.40
Hungriness and my fatigue and my desire to just get home and it's going to seem for all the world

71
00:05:30.40 --> 00:05:32.40
Like everybody else is just in my way

72
00:05:34.68 --> 00:05:38.36
And who are all these people in my way and look at how

73
00:05:38.92 --> 00:05:45.44
repulsive most of them are and how stupid and cow like and dead-eyed and non-human they seem in the checkout line or at

74
00:05:45.60 --> 00:05:53.12
How annoying and rude it is that people are talking loudly on cell phones in the middle of the line and look at how deeply and personally

75
00:05:53.12 --> 00:05:55.12
unfair this is

76
00:05:56.48 --> 00:06:02.60
Or of course if I'm in a more socially conscious liberal arts form of my default setting

77
00:06:02.60 --> 00:06:07.56
I can spend in the end of the day traffic being disgusted by all the huge

78
00:06:07.88 --> 00:06:14.96
Stupid lane blocking SUVs and hummers and v12 pickup trucks burning their wasteful selfish 40 gallon tanks of gas

79
00:06:14.96 --> 00:06:21.48
And I can dwell on the fact that the patriotic or religious bumper stickers always seem to be on the biggest most

80
00:06:21.48 --> 00:06:28.10
Disgustingly selfish vehicles driven by the ugliest. This is the an example of how not to think

81
00:06:31.16 --> 00:06:36.68
Most disgustingly selfish vehicles driven by the ugliest most inconsiderate aggressive drivers

82
00:06:36.68 --> 00:06:43.88
And I can think about how our children's children will despise us for wasting all the futures fuel and probably screwing up the

83
00:06:43.88 --> 00:06:49.08
Climate and how spoiled and stupid and selfish and disgusting we all are and how modern consumer society just sucks

84
00:06:49.08 --> 00:06:52.76
And so forth and so on you get the idea

85
00:06:55.56 --> 00:07:02.64
If I choose to think this way in a store and on the freeway fine lots of us do accept

86
00:07:03.76 --> 00:07:07.04
Thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic

87
00:07:08.28 --> 00:07:10.28
That it doesn't have a choice

88
00:07:11.08 --> 00:07:13.28
It is my natural default setting

89
00:07:13.28 --> 00:07:21.24
It's the automatic way that I experience boring frustrating crowded parts of adult life when I'm operating on all the

90
00:07:21.48 --> 00:07:29.84
Automatic unconscious belief that I am the center of the world and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world's priorities

91
00:07:32.64 --> 00:07:34.64
The thing is of course

92
00:07:35.40 --> 00:07:40.72
There are two there are totally different ways to think about these kind of situations in this traffic

93
00:07:40.72 --> 00:07:43.60
All these vehicles stopped and idling in my way

94
00:07:43.60 --> 00:07:47.64
It's not impossible that some of these people in these SUVs have been in horrible

95
00:07:48.40 --> 00:07:54.68
Auto accidents in the past and now find driving so terrifying that their therapist has all but ordered them to get huge heavy

96
00:07:54.92 --> 00:08:00.80
SUV so they can feel safe enough to drive or that the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father

97
00:08:00.80 --> 00:08:03.72
Whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him

98
00:08:03.72 --> 00:08:08.16
And he's trying to get his kid to a hospital and he's in a bigger more legitimate hurry than I am

99
00:08:08.16 --> 00:08:12.20
It is actually I who am in his way

100
00:08:13.88 --> 00:08:18.52
Or I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarket

101
00:08:18.88 --> 00:08:26.64
Check out line is just as bored and frustrated as I am and that some of these people probably have harder more tedious and more

102
00:08:26.64 --> 00:08:28.64
painful lives than I do

103
00:08:30.24 --> 00:08:36.16
Again, please don't think that I am giving you moral advice or that I'm saying you are supposed to think this way or that anybody

104
00:08:36.16 --> 00:08:40.80
Expects you to just automatically do it because it's hard. It takes will and effort

105
00:08:41.32 --> 00:08:47.64
And if you are like me some days you won't be able to do it or you just flat out won't want to

106
00:08:50.56 --> 00:08:52.56
But most days

107
00:08:52.68 --> 00:08:55.28
If you're aware enough to give yourself a choice

108
00:08:55.44 --> 00:09:02.96
You can choose to look differently at this fat dead-eyed over made-up lady who just screamed at her kid in the checkout line

109
00:09:02.96 --> 00:09:04.96
Maybe she's not

110
00:09:04.96 --> 00:09:09.24
Unusually like this. Maybe she's not usually like this. Maybe she's been up three

111
00:09:09.84 --> 00:09:17.88
Straight nights holding the hand of a husband who is dying of bone cancer or maybe this very lady is the low-wage clerk at the motor vehicle department

112
00:09:17.88 --> 00:09:25.48
Who just yesterday helped your spouse resolve a horrific and furiating red tape problem through some small act of bureaucratic kindness

113
00:09:27.68 --> 00:09:29.68
Of course, none of this is likely

114
00:09:30.04 --> 00:09:32.04
But it's also not impossible

115
00:09:32.04 --> 00:09:35.92
It just depends on what you want to consider

116
00:09:37.20 --> 00:09:45.84
If you're automatically sure that you know what reality is and you are operating on your default setting then you like me

117
00:09:46.48 --> 00:09:51.000
Probably won't consider possibilities that aren't annoying and miserable

118
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.44
But if you really learn how to pay attention

119
00:09:56.48 --> 00:09:58.88
Then you will know there are other options

120
00:09:58.88 --> 00:10:09.08
It will actually be within your power to experience a crowded hot slow consumer hell type situation as not only meaningful

121
00:10:09.88 --> 00:10:14.76
But sacred on fire with the same force that made the stars love

122
00:10:15.40 --> 00:10:18.84
Fellowship the mystical oneness of all things deep down

123
00:10:20.40 --> 00:10:23.32
Not that that mystical stuff is necessarily true

124
00:10:24.32 --> 00:10:27.60
The only thing that's capital T true

125
00:10:27.60 --> 00:10:32.64
Is that you get to decide how you're gonna try to see it?

126
00:10:37.52 --> 00:10:39.52
So

127
00:10:41.40 --> 00:10:43.80
The reason that I wanted to go back to this

128
00:10:44.88 --> 00:10:46.80
speech is

129
00:10:46.80 --> 00:10:49.52
Because it points out the fact

130
00:10:50.92 --> 00:10:53.84
That it's very easy. It's it's extremely easy

131
00:10:53.84 --> 00:10:57.68
To go through life on autopilot

132
00:10:59.32 --> 00:11:01.32
Right to actually go through life

133
00:11:02.16 --> 00:11:04.64
Seeing things through miserable colored

134
00:11:05.60 --> 00:11:11.76
Lenses right, you know, you get the rose colored lenses. It's really easy to go through life it with just seeing everything is miserable

135
00:11:12.32 --> 00:11:14.32
Just like it's that that's easy

136
00:11:16.12 --> 00:11:20.72
We actually get to choose the way we look at things sometimes we don't even realize that we have a choice

137
00:11:20.72 --> 00:11:26.04
We get numb down and we get dumbed down and I think that's why oftentimes

138
00:11:26.76 --> 00:11:28.96
People don't realize that they're in a game

139
00:11:30.36 --> 00:11:32.12
They don't see it

140
00:11:32.12 --> 00:11:33.84
so

141
00:11:33.84 --> 00:11:38.84
They end up just simply following along and just existing in the game without noticing that it's being played

142
00:11:41.60 --> 00:11:43.60
Now

143
00:11:43.68 --> 00:11:49.84
There's a couple things to think about as we continue this discussion about the games and playing games and the game that we're in

144
00:11:49.84 --> 00:11:52.88
with games in any game

145
00:11:53.68 --> 00:11:55.44
Well in most games

146
00:11:55.44 --> 00:11:59.48
There's chances. There's there's a level of luck involved

147
00:12:00.40 --> 00:12:06.000
Good luck bad luck, right? I mean it happens on a football field to get a bad bounce get a good bounce

148
00:12:06.08 --> 00:12:08.08
That can be win or lose the game

149
00:12:09.28 --> 00:12:13.20
That in wrestling they literally toss a coin in wrestling

150
00:12:13.84 --> 00:12:17.32
Who can get top position who's gonna get bottom position if you're a great top player

151
00:12:17.32 --> 00:12:22.96
You could and you're bad at bottom player. You can literally win or lose the game on a ton on a coin toss

152
00:12:25.08 --> 00:12:31.04
So there's there's a certain aspect a certain element of luck in

153
00:12:32.04 --> 00:12:34.04
any game and

154
00:12:34.76 --> 00:12:37.44
There's a certain aspect of luck

155
00:12:39.08 --> 00:12:42.40
In life right. Oh, it's really nice to be

156
00:12:42.40 --> 00:12:50.12
Born into a good family with with health and money and connections and stability

157
00:12:50.12 --> 00:12:52.12
That's that's great, right?

158
00:12:53.32 --> 00:12:54.24
And

159
00:12:54.24 --> 00:12:58.48
There's there's a certain amount of skill that can you can be

160
00:12:59.40 --> 00:13:04.24
Lucky enough to have yeah, you want to be a basketball player. It's really nice when you're 6 9

161
00:13:05.40 --> 00:13:08.76
right or if you want to go into academics and you have a

162
00:13:08.76 --> 00:13:14.48
Photographic memory that's you're pretty lucky and not everyone gets that gift

163
00:13:15.48 --> 00:13:19.84
You're in a business world and you have a good knack for numbers. Those are those are nice things to have

164
00:13:20.68 --> 00:13:22.68
so there's luck and

165
00:13:23.16 --> 00:13:25.52
There's some skill that you are

166
00:13:26.80 --> 00:13:29.96
That you you might just have through that luck

167
00:13:33.20 --> 00:13:35.20
But

168
00:13:35.20 --> 00:13:38.56
And this is sort of lends to what we talked about in the last podcast

169
00:13:40.08 --> 00:13:42.08
It's your play

170
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.84
That has the most impact in dictating success or failure

171
00:13:48.16 --> 00:13:54.16
It's you it's the way it's how you play the game that counts

172
00:13:57.52 --> 00:14:00.44
Now we need to think about this

173
00:14:00.44 --> 00:14:06.64
Because if you were 6 9 probably be a pretty good pretty good decision to get into basketball

174
00:14:07.20 --> 00:14:12.40
There's no guarantee, but you you at least you're kind of gonna be on on the map a little bit

175
00:14:12.40 --> 00:14:16.48
I mean in high school you're gonna be a dominant player. You're 6 9. You're gonna be a dominant player

176
00:14:17.60 --> 00:14:19.60
so

177
00:14:19.60 --> 00:14:24.76
You gotta kind of make a decision about what game you're gonna play

178
00:14:24.76 --> 00:14:30.08
And that that starts to play a role and whether you're gonna win or lose the game

179
00:14:30.68 --> 00:14:33.88
Because if you're 6 9 and you decide to become a gymnast

180
00:14:36.84 --> 00:14:40.96
You're gonna have issues right sure you're gonna have issues

181
00:14:42.16 --> 00:14:44.16
If you're 5 2 5 3

182
00:14:46.16 --> 00:14:50.16
And you decide you're gonna play basketball you're probably gonna have some issues knock it can be done

183
00:14:50.16 --> 00:14:53.78
And you decide you're gonna play basketball you're probably gonna have some issues knock it can be done

184
00:14:55.16 --> 00:14:57.16
Right Mugsie Bogues

185
00:14:57.72 --> 00:15:02.80
5 3 I think he's 5 3. I think he's 5 3. You know Mugsie Bogues is yeah

186
00:15:04.20 --> 00:15:06.20
5 3

187
00:15:06.28 --> 00:15:08.28
Playing the NBA

188
00:15:08.40 --> 00:15:13.32
And like playing in the NBA and sitting on the bench. Yeah, he's playing in the NBA

189
00:15:13.32 --> 00:15:19.80
You know he didn't get you get that gift, but what matters is how he played

190
00:15:21.96 --> 00:15:23.96
So

191
00:15:25.68 --> 00:15:30.60
We have to pay attention to that that you have a choice as to what game you're gonna play

192
00:15:32.56 --> 00:15:38.44
What games you're going to play you have a choice into how you're gonna keep score you have a choice in

193
00:15:38.44 --> 00:15:41.76
What means winning and what means losing?

194
00:15:44.68 --> 00:15:46.68
So

195
00:15:46.68 --> 00:15:50.72
When it comes to life what game are we playing what rules?

196
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And how do we win?

197
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.32
We're talking about the broad the supreme game of life

198
00:15:59.32 --> 00:16:05.72
You could probably start with Maslow's hierarchy of needs right so this guy is

199
00:16:05.72 --> 00:16:08.12
He this guy Maslow

200
00:16:09.40 --> 00:16:11.64
Abraham Maslow born in Brooklyn

201
00:16:12.36 --> 00:16:19.48
1908 died in 1970s a psychologist and he made up this motivational hierarchy in psychology and

202
00:16:20.84 --> 00:16:22.84
This was his biggest contribution

203
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.76
And so it with the the base of the pyramid the lowest thing

204
00:16:28.76 --> 00:16:34.76
But the most important thing that you have to get out of the gate is your physiological needs obviously air water food

205
00:16:34.76 --> 00:16:36.76
shelter sleep clothing

206
00:16:38.08 --> 00:16:41.08
Reproduction like these are the base needs that you have

207
00:16:43.12 --> 00:16:45.12
Those are your physiological needs

208
00:16:45.92 --> 00:16:49.80
above that in his according to his hierarchy is safety

209
00:16:51.08 --> 00:16:52.40
So

210
00:16:52.40 --> 00:17:00.32
Personal security like how can you make sure that you're safe and they include in this like employment and resources and health and property

211
00:17:00.32 --> 00:17:05.48
All those things are sort of wrapped up in safety the next one up is love and belonging

212
00:17:05.48 --> 00:17:12.04
You know, I don't know like to say the L word on the podcast, but love and belonging. This is friendship. This is intimacy

213
00:17:12.04 --> 00:17:16.68
This is family. This is a sense of connection. You got a steam is the next one

214
00:17:18.32 --> 00:17:24.44
Which is respect and status and recognition and strength and freedom and then you get self-actualization

215
00:17:27.68 --> 00:17:29.52
Which is

216
00:17:29.52 --> 00:17:31.52
the desire

217
00:17:32.32 --> 00:17:35.72
For a human to maximize their potential

218
00:17:38.16 --> 00:17:40.16
So

219
00:17:40.44 --> 00:17:46.04
Some of the characteristics of that are how you perceive reality that you can that someone that's self-actualized

220
00:17:46.80 --> 00:17:51.80
Can perceive reality the way it is now we've talked about this before like

221
00:17:52.60 --> 00:17:54.60
Everyone's perception reality is different

222
00:17:54.60 --> 00:18:02.28
So we don't really how we judge in that one not really 100% sure these people that self have self actualized

223
00:18:02.76 --> 00:18:06.80
Actualized they can accept themselves for what they really are

224
00:18:09.56 --> 00:18:11.56
Which again

225
00:18:11.76 --> 00:18:13.76
That's an interesting one because if

226
00:18:14.60 --> 00:18:21.72
You are mugs ebogs and you're like well, I just have to deal with the fact that I'm 5 3 and I'm never no actually he didn't accept it

227
00:18:21.72 --> 00:18:26.20
Except other people for who they are they're not self-centered. They're creative. They're resistant to conformity

228
00:18:26.92 --> 00:18:29.36
They appreciate basic life experience so

229
00:18:30.64 --> 00:18:33.68
That's this that's this hierarchy of needs

230
00:18:34.44 --> 00:18:37.40
Right you got your physiological needs your safety

231
00:18:39.56 --> 00:18:44.12
I get it we got to start with that food water shelter sure

232
00:18:45.12 --> 00:18:48.24
We get that if you don't have that you're just not much of a difference

233
00:18:48.24 --> 00:18:55.28
Going on safety sure we get that if you're under constant fear for the for the mouse

234
00:18:55.80 --> 00:19:01.04
Trapped with the cat. That's not good. You got to figure out now you get to this one belonging

235
00:19:05.08 --> 00:19:09.64
Not everyone has this deep desire to belong like I get it. It's a pretty common

236
00:19:11.08 --> 00:19:15.88
But some people prefer to be alone. I mean there's such a thing as a hundred percent

237
00:19:15.88 --> 00:19:20.96
Right and and I think different people would prioritize this differently

238
00:19:22.80 --> 00:19:23.20
I

239
00:19:23.20 --> 00:19:28.92
Get that you could say for most people we want to have some social belonging

240
00:19:30.40 --> 00:19:32.40
But I think this varies a lot

241
00:19:34.40 --> 00:19:39.60
That being said I think it's a strong. I think in most people it is a pretty strong thing, you know, that's why we have

242
00:19:40.52 --> 00:19:43.16
Tribes that's why we have gangs. That's why we have

243
00:19:43.16 --> 00:19:45.16
Freakin Democrats and Republicans

244
00:19:45.92 --> 00:19:47.92
That's why we have

245
00:19:48.48 --> 00:19:56.16
Sports teams that people wear the coming. Can you imagine how much it's billions of dollars that sports teams makes from the sales of merchandise

246
00:19:56.16 --> 00:20:00.68
So you can wear your your gangs insignia on your jersey

247
00:20:02.52 --> 00:20:07.88
So that clearly indicates you don't spend that kind of money if you don't want some kind of sense of boring so so this is

248
00:20:08.68 --> 00:20:10.68
I'm just

249
00:20:10.68 --> 00:20:13.28
Saying not everyone feels this way

250
00:20:13.80 --> 00:20:20.80
But it's definitely one of those things that I can understand a steam now. We'll get a healthy a healthy ideal

251
00:20:21.32 --> 00:20:27.20
Like you're talking about all I want to be a steamer. I have good self-esteem. Now. What point does this start turning into ego, right?

252
00:20:28.52 --> 00:20:32.60
My status that's what my concern is. Yeah, like why is that?

253
00:20:33.56 --> 00:20:36.32
Or recognition I really want to be recognized. That's really

254
00:20:37.20 --> 00:20:39.20
That's ego man

255
00:20:39.20 --> 00:20:42.64
And I'm not saying it's there for sure

256
00:20:43.88 --> 00:20:49.52
If you can I would recommend you break break away from that ego ego ego anchor

257
00:20:49.84 --> 00:20:53.52
That's pulling you into status and pulling you into recognition

258
00:20:56.12 --> 00:20:59.12
And then you get this idea of self-actualization

259
00:21:00.16 --> 00:21:04.96
Again to me, this is like an ideal you got someone that's like focused on becoming who they are, right?

260
00:21:05.80 --> 00:21:07.80
Yeah, I might be into it might be into

261
00:21:07.80 --> 00:21:10.36
Yeah, I might be into it might be in too much. Yes, you harden it

262
00:21:12.04 --> 00:21:14.04
Well, yes

263
00:21:14.56 --> 00:21:21.68
And it kind of was this the status ego esteem part. That's where you begun your journey into too hard in the paint

264
00:21:23.60 --> 00:21:28.56
The status and ego recognition and stuff then again, I don't know I could be wrong

265
00:21:28.56 --> 00:21:32.48
I can't read Maslow's mind, but this is what it seems like

266
00:21:32.48 --> 00:21:41.80
It's like an inner need now if you need this above and beyond normal stuff then it starts to mutate right like just like how you say like a healthy

267
00:21:41.80 --> 00:21:47.08
There's a healthy idea of it. Yeah versus an inflated ego where the inflated ego is like bad

268
00:21:47.08 --> 00:21:51.000
You start, you know the dichotomy as one might say so like the like

269
00:21:51.88 --> 00:21:56.36
We'll say recognition for example, right? It's not to say that like

270
00:21:56.36 --> 00:22:03.56
Someone's pining and yearning very very hard for the recognition. It's just that when you get recognition for something you did good

271
00:22:03.76 --> 00:22:08.28
It's gonna be hard to find somebody who just doesn't care and doesn't make them feel good, right?

272
00:22:08.28 --> 00:22:15.80
So there that isn't indicated. There is some need in there, you know, not to say they're gonna break their back or throw their mom under the bus

273
00:22:15.80 --> 00:22:20.48
For that recognition. That's like mutated, you know, I was saying not saying that they wouldn't do that

274
00:22:20.48 --> 00:22:26.96
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, and I would imagine this kind of goes for everything where yeah, I can kind of go too far or whatever

275
00:22:26.96 --> 00:22:28.96
But generally speaking we're talking about the

276
00:22:29.88 --> 00:22:35.84
Normal level of hey, I want to be I want to feel belonging. I want to feel

277
00:22:36.24 --> 00:22:38.24
esteemed I want to feel

278
00:22:38.44 --> 00:22:44.38
Recognized and appreciated now, you know all these things that we normal people and we like to feel so what I'm saying is

279
00:22:44.72 --> 00:22:47.96
You have to ask yourself if that's the game you're gonna play

280
00:22:47.96 --> 00:22:49.96
Mm-hmm

281
00:22:49.96 --> 00:22:55.68
That is that the game you're gonna play you want recognition. Okay, you want status, okay?

282
00:22:56.40 --> 00:23:00.52
So that's that you want this quote-unquote self

283
00:23:01.36 --> 00:23:05.42
Actualization, what does that actually mean? That can mean a lot of different things to look

284
00:23:05.42 --> 00:23:10.64
There's people that are self actualization is becoming a Buddhist monk in Thailand, right? Yeah

285
00:23:11.72 --> 00:23:17.04
There's some people self actualization is becoming, you know, the Jiu-Jitsu champion, right?

286
00:23:17.04 --> 00:23:21.72
There's some people going down the line. Yeah, so that that's a that's a real

287
00:23:22.48 --> 00:23:24.48
vague term, yeah

288
00:23:26.52 --> 00:23:29.68
I'm sure some psychologist is gonna chime in from that

289
00:23:30.52 --> 00:23:34.50
Cheap seats. It's very pop and if he does he's probably gonna say what I'm saying where it's like

290
00:23:36.96 --> 00:23:38.96
Think of it in terms of like an ego

291
00:23:40.80 --> 00:23:42.56
Extreme terms

292
00:23:42.56 --> 00:23:45.92
Think of it in normal terms, you know like you want food. Oh

293
00:23:45.92 --> 00:23:47.92
Well, just because

294
00:23:48.04 --> 00:23:51.40
Centering his whole life over pursuing food none and that's not what we're saying

295
00:23:51.40 --> 00:23:56.08
We're saying so it's an ideal each one of these if we view them as an ideal. They're somewhat more acceptable

296
00:23:57.64 --> 00:23:59.16
But they are

297
00:23:59.16 --> 00:24:04.16
Games and we did the last podcast we talked about these some of these specific games we talked about work

298
00:24:04.16 --> 00:24:07.20
We talked about health and fitness. We talked about relationships. We talked about life

299
00:24:07.20 --> 00:24:15.32
You start talking about legacy a little bit the and those are sensible pursuits for most people

300
00:24:15.80 --> 00:24:19.20
After water shelter food and safety in my opinion

301
00:24:19.88 --> 00:24:21.04
work

302
00:24:21.04 --> 00:24:23.04
But good job

303
00:24:23.16 --> 00:24:30.000
Occupation health and fitness. Yes good relationships. Yes, maybe the relationships that that that's in belonging, right?

304
00:24:30.72 --> 00:24:34.64
Maybe the work goes into a steam of recognition and status

305
00:24:34.64 --> 00:24:41.72
So I'm just trying to line these up and understand what I think with what some a little bit more, you know

306
00:24:42.36 --> 00:24:44.36
academic version of this is

307
00:24:45.80 --> 00:24:47.08
But

308
00:24:47.08 --> 00:24:52.84
When we talk about these we talk about a steam we talk about job and we talk about life we talk about

309
00:24:54.44 --> 00:24:56.44
recognition

310
00:24:57.32 --> 00:25:00.56
You could put these into into various games

311
00:25:00.56 --> 00:25:07.16
With various reward systems with various ways of winning and a real obvious one is money a

312
00:25:09.56 --> 00:25:12.84
Lot of people they're playing the game of trying to gather up money

313
00:25:16.72 --> 00:25:18.72
And I think

314
00:25:18.72 --> 00:25:20.48
really

315
00:25:20.48 --> 00:25:22.48
money is a little bit of a

316
00:25:23.48 --> 00:25:27.04
Substitute for freedom right it's supposed to be that if you have more money

317
00:25:27.04 --> 00:25:33.000
You eventually get freedom and there's the whole idea that you know someone is a

318
00:25:33.96 --> 00:25:35.08
Ski bum

319
00:25:35.08 --> 00:25:38.64
Mm-hmm. They don't have any money. They work, you know up on the mountain

320
00:25:39.08 --> 00:25:41.08
They're a lifty up on the mountain

321
00:25:41.08 --> 00:25:45.40
Yeah, and they got to work four hours in the morning every day, but they're skiing every day

322
00:25:45.40 --> 00:25:48.88
Yeah, so they even though they have money they're kind of doing what then meanwhile

323
00:25:48.88 --> 00:25:50.88
There's another guy that's working 80 hour weeks

324
00:25:51.56 --> 00:25:53.56
Down in you know down in the city

325
00:25:54.44 --> 00:25:55.76
and he

326
00:25:55.76 --> 00:25:59.80
Busts his ass so he can go up and ski for those six days vacation, right?

327
00:26:01.40 --> 00:26:04.84
So you're supposed to be getting freedom from money

328
00:26:06.60 --> 00:26:08.60
Doesn't always work out that way

329
00:26:08.92 --> 00:26:10.92
pursuit of money

330
00:26:11.24 --> 00:26:16.48
Can actually end up being sort of an addiction as well where now that's where it becomes your master and

331
00:26:18.16 --> 00:26:20.16
And listen I've known people

332
00:26:20.16 --> 00:26:25.24
That they love that game they've literally love

333
00:26:26.04 --> 00:26:34.68
Making money like deals and they love it and every time they make money. It's it's incredibly rewarding to them

334
00:26:37.84 --> 00:26:39.84
If they're lucky

335
00:26:40.28 --> 00:26:42.28
They're good at that game

336
00:26:42.28 --> 00:26:49.56
And and I've got friends that are really good at making a lot of money and they're good at it and they're happy and they

337
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.20
You know you ever wonder oh how many millions of dollars do you need?

338
00:26:53.52 --> 00:26:56.70
Right people like all more but they they are

339
00:26:57.28 --> 00:26:59.16
Hey, they got enough money to do whatever they want

340
00:26:59.16 --> 00:27:02.48
You know what they want to do they want to get more money because that's the game that they're playing and they love that game

341
00:27:04.48 --> 00:27:06.48
And

342
00:27:06.52 --> 00:27:08.52
Some people

343
00:27:08.52 --> 00:27:13.72
Want to play that game and they're not good at it. They're not good at making money and

344
00:27:14.52 --> 00:27:16.52
They're not going to be happy

345
00:27:17.52 --> 00:27:19.52
so

346
00:27:20.60 --> 00:27:24.88
That's terrible because you get someone that's not really good at making money and

347
00:27:25.08 --> 00:27:28.56
They play in that game and they don't win and they're not going to be happy

348
00:27:29.44 --> 00:27:33.76
So you got to be careful when it comes to the money-making game

349
00:27:33.76 --> 00:27:40.56
Are you good at it? We talked about last time are you in the are you playing the game with money?

350
00:27:40.56 --> 00:27:42.32
That's going to make you a lot of money

351
00:27:42.32 --> 00:27:44.32
Because if you're working, you know

352
00:27:45.16 --> 00:27:50.08
80 90 a hundred hours a week in the wrong game. You're not making any money

353
00:27:51.60 --> 00:27:53.08
You know you make

354
00:27:53.08 --> 00:27:56.000
$52,000 a year working 80 hour a week

355
00:27:57.40 --> 00:28:00.44
You're a hard worker you're smart, but it's just not getting you there

356
00:28:00.44 --> 00:28:03.20
You got to be playing a different game

357
00:28:04.44 --> 00:28:06.08
now

358
00:28:06.08 --> 00:28:10.72
The thing the weird thing about so this is one example right it's common example people are playing the game for money

359
00:28:10.72 --> 00:28:13.36
But there's all kinds of people there's people that make

360
00:28:14.96 --> 00:28:21.32
All kinds of stuff into their game like what they're into right look and it's sort of ecosystems right you could be in a

361
00:28:21.32 --> 00:28:27.16
Jiu-Jitsu you want that to be that's what you're doing to you or a basketball player or

362
00:28:27.16 --> 00:28:32.08
Academia right people pursue a life in academia. They want to win that game

363
00:28:32.08 --> 00:28:34.48
They want to get the most prestigious college they want to get the most prestige

364
00:28:34.48 --> 00:28:37.98
They want to write the prestigious paper that gets published in the procedures

365
00:28:38.96 --> 00:28:41.20
When they call it journal, yeah, hell yeah

366
00:28:42.52 --> 00:28:45.90
There's people that the game that they're playing is cars

367
00:28:46.84 --> 00:28:48.84
Right okay getting cool cars

368
00:28:49.96 --> 00:28:54.20
Or being in the military. I always got to bring that one up. I was in the military. I was playing that game

369
00:28:54.72 --> 00:28:56.44
I was in that game

370
00:28:56.44 --> 00:29:00.48
You're trying to get you know get the right job working the right place

371
00:29:01.60 --> 00:29:03.60
You know I want to be a seal

372
00:29:06.40 --> 00:29:08.40
People are into chess

373
00:29:08.56 --> 00:29:16.56
People are into women like you name it and there's someone that's gonna make that a huge part of the game that they're playing

374
00:29:16.56 --> 00:29:27.60
Can do this with anything actually you know in the book final spin sure the that's sort of the character of arty the cleaner who's

375
00:29:27.84 --> 00:29:30.40
totally into washing machines and dryers and

376
00:29:31.56 --> 00:29:33.56
Folding laundry and stuff like that

377
00:29:33.92 --> 00:29:41.06
That's sort of a statement about people that are just into random things and that's the main game that they're playing in their life

378
00:29:41.06 --> 00:29:48.02
Here's what's kind of good about some of those games is that they're deaf there's they're defined

379
00:29:49.22 --> 00:29:53.50
Right so you want to be a Jiu-Jitsu champion. Okay?

380
00:29:54.10 --> 00:29:59.50
Here's what you do. Here's you train you compete if you want to get to the pinnacle

381
00:29:59.74 --> 00:30:06.70
You learn these moves you cut weight you get to this championship you win. That's the defined what you do academia, right?

382
00:30:06.70 --> 00:30:08.70
Same thing like oh you know

383
00:30:08.70 --> 00:30:12.30
You want to be you want to be a respected academic?

384
00:30:13.02 --> 00:30:17.54
Go to this school go to this school go to this school get this degree get this degree to this degree get

385
00:30:18.34 --> 00:30:20.34
write your paper

386
00:30:21.06 --> 00:30:27.38
For the journal right do those things and eventually you're at the apex or you're at least in the top percent of this

387
00:30:27.90 --> 00:30:29.90
academic group

388
00:30:29.90 --> 00:30:35.22
Military is really defined. Oh you're gonna go in you're gonna get this job. You're gonna do this job. You're gonna promote

389
00:30:35.22 --> 00:30:37.22
So

390
00:30:37.26 --> 00:30:39.74
They tell you what the game is

391
00:30:40.74 --> 00:30:44.18
They tell you how to compete and they tell you what winning is

392
00:30:46.46 --> 00:30:51.78
So in in some respects those games kind of have something cool to them. They're defined

393
00:30:52.38 --> 00:30:54.98
What's bad about some of those games?

394
00:30:56.86 --> 00:30:59.66
Is there they're not as all-encompassing

395
00:30:59.66 --> 00:31:04.62
As people think so people get wrapped around being the best

396
00:31:05.22 --> 00:31:07.90
Jiu-jitsu player the best basketball player the best

397
00:31:08.42 --> 00:31:13.06
Akadia best in academia the best in the military happens a lot with the military, right?

398
00:31:13.06 --> 00:31:16.86
We see that the person's doing the military thing and then all of a sudden their careers are

399
00:31:18.06 --> 00:31:21.94
Like hey, you're a general or an admiral in the military

400
00:31:22.86 --> 00:31:26.74
Let's say you're a four-star admiral or a three-star general

401
00:31:26.74 --> 00:31:29.42
Bro you are kind of a king

402
00:31:29.98 --> 00:31:32.58
Yeah, right you're kind of a king you have a

403
00:31:33.10 --> 00:31:36.78
Shofur your people vehicles driving you around you get off the plane

404
00:31:36.78 --> 00:31:41.70
There's people waiting for you. They set their whole schedule around you. You got you got

405
00:31:42.30 --> 00:31:49.62
Billions of dollars at play like with fuel for ships and planes and oh hey, I want to take this plane over here. You can do it

406
00:31:50.62 --> 00:31:52.62
You're sort of this incredible

407
00:31:52.62 --> 00:31:57.22
Impowered person and then one day you retire

408
00:31:58.62 --> 00:32:01.22
And all of a sudden all that stuff is gone

409
00:32:02.30 --> 00:32:07.94
Now look you're probably gonna go get a job at some military company and fuel that military industrial complex

410
00:32:07.94 --> 00:32:12.82
But even then even then you're just another at that point. You're another admiral you're another J

411
00:32:12.82 --> 00:32:17.82
They got they got 28 animals. They got 47

412
00:32:17.82 --> 00:32:21.82
Generals so you all of a sudden you're just a person again or

413
00:32:22.82 --> 00:32:26.82
You're in the SEAL teams or you're in force recon or you're in Mars soccer

414
00:32:26.82 --> 00:32:30.82
You're a green bray and that's all you they man you walk in you're an army dude

415
00:32:30.82 --> 00:32:36.82
You're an art your green bray and you walk into a you know a conventional army battalion all of a sudden people are giving you respect

416
00:32:38.82 --> 00:32:40.82
Once you get out who whatever

417
00:32:42.82 --> 00:32:44.82
You know

418
00:32:44.82 --> 00:32:47.82
You're a fighter UFC fighter

419
00:32:49.82 --> 00:32:51.82
You know what happens when you're done

420
00:32:52.82 --> 00:32:53.82
What are you doing?

421
00:32:54.82 --> 00:32:55.82
You were a champion

422
00:32:56.82 --> 00:32:57.82
Or you were a contender

423
00:32:58.82 --> 00:33:01.82
Now all of a sudden you look around. What do you have?

424
00:33:01.82 --> 00:33:03.82
You've got people are doing better now in the UFC, but

425
00:33:04.82 --> 00:33:07.82
Ten years ago even five years ago. I guess go ten years ago

426
00:33:08.82 --> 00:33:10.82
You know you're a fighter

427
00:33:10.82 --> 00:33:16.82
Ten years ago even five years ago. I guess go ten years ago if you were the champion of the world

428
00:33:18.82 --> 00:33:25.82
And then you couldn't fight anymore for whatever reason got too old or you got beat up too much or you know you were just done you got injured

429
00:33:26.82 --> 00:33:27.82
What do you have?

430
00:33:28.82 --> 00:33:31.82
Those guys literally don't have any money. There's nothing

431
00:33:33.82 --> 00:33:38.82
So all of a sudden you look up from one of those games that those types of games that we're talking about

432
00:33:38.82 --> 00:33:41.82
You look up from that game and all of a sudden you don't have anything

433
00:33:42.82 --> 00:33:44.82
You have anything you won the game

434
00:33:45.82 --> 00:33:46.82
You won the game

435
00:33:48.82 --> 00:33:50.82
You know I was talking

436
00:33:51.82 --> 00:33:53.82
With a very senior

437
00:33:54.82 --> 00:33:55.82
Flag officer

438
00:33:56.82 --> 00:33:57.82
I'm not going to narrow it down

439
00:33:58.82 --> 00:33:59.82
Between the services but

440
00:34:00.82 --> 00:34:05.82
Admiral general type with multiple stars on their collar is that would flag officer

441
00:34:05.82 --> 00:34:08.82
Yeah, yeah, because they have to own flag that flies again

442
00:34:08.82 --> 00:34:15.82
It's like you know you show up you're a flag officer they fly a flag for you one star two stars three star flag gets flown damn, okay

443
00:34:16.82 --> 00:34:22.82
But he was telling me about another flag officer that he had spoken to and

444
00:34:23.82 --> 00:34:26.82
The other flag officer was even more senior to him

445
00:34:27.82 --> 00:34:30.82
And that senior flag officer retired

446
00:34:30.82 --> 00:34:34.82
And the junior flag officer was like oh, you know how's retirement going? You know do you miss the Navy?

447
00:34:34.82 --> 00:34:37.82
And he goes like I said it was the Navy, but yeah, it was the Navy

448
00:34:38.82 --> 00:34:44.82
He goes, uh, do you miss the do you miss the Navy? He's like that's all bullshit. I was like damn a

449
00:34:45.82 --> 00:34:49.82
Very senior person not he wasn't in the SEAL teams, but a very senior person

450
00:34:49.82 --> 00:34:55.82
Saying that his career where he'd spent you know what is 25 30 maybe even over 30 years. That's all bullshit

451
00:34:55.82 --> 00:35:01.82
But even this is this is he was in the game knew he was in the game

452
00:35:02.82 --> 00:35:06.82
But thought that that was the supreme game and it wasn't

453
00:35:07.82 --> 00:35:10.82
And when he got out he looked around and said damn

454
00:35:11.82 --> 00:35:16.82
I was playing this game over here. I was like the most dominant

455
00:35:17.82 --> 00:35:19.82
Freakin kickball player on the school field

456
00:35:19.82 --> 00:35:25.82
And I was the champion and people had to give me their their cookies at lunch because I beat them

457
00:35:26.82 --> 00:35:31.82
And then all of a sudden he looks like gets like leaves the school field and realize there's major league baseball

458
00:35:32.82 --> 00:35:37.82
Right or he just wasn't it's just a little tiny game

459
00:35:39.82 --> 00:35:43.82
So we as people need to be cognizant of the fact

460
00:35:43.82 --> 00:35:49.82
And recognize the game that we're that we're focused on and make sure that that game

461
00:35:50.82 --> 00:35:53.82
Is what we want it to be

462
00:35:55.82 --> 00:35:57.82
Make sure that it's

463
00:35:58.82 --> 00:36:01.82
Equivalent for the effort that we're putting into it

464
00:36:02.82 --> 00:36:06.82
And look there's some people they get out of the army they get out of the Navy they get out of the Marine Corps

465
00:36:07.82 --> 00:36:11.82
And they're they're totally stoked. They're like oh, yeah, I play the game

466
00:36:11.82 --> 00:36:13.82
It was awesome. I loved it. I'm retired now

467
00:36:14.82 --> 00:36:19.82
I'm good with it. I'm glad I invested all that time and effort into that game because I loved it

468
00:36:20.82 --> 00:36:25.82
I feel that way. Yeah, like I don't feel I got out of the SEAL teams. I was like damn that was freaking awesome

469
00:36:27.82 --> 00:36:29.82
That was awesome loved every second of it

470
00:36:32.82 --> 00:36:36.82
If you don't pay attention you might be putting your time and effort

471
00:36:36.82 --> 00:36:40.82
Into a game that's not as important as you think it is

472
00:36:42.82 --> 00:36:44.82
So be careful of that

473
00:36:45.82 --> 00:36:47.82
Can see this with social media as well

474
00:36:48.82 --> 00:36:55.82
Right like people think that social media matters in a big way

475
00:36:57.82 --> 00:37:02.82
And it's like oh actually, you know, actually you could go off social media and

476
00:37:02.82 --> 00:37:07.82
Okay, sure someone might be like oh my gosh. Oh what happened? Oh, actually they wouldn't say oh my gosh

477
00:37:07.82 --> 00:37:12.82
No, they'd be like oh, I know she remember social media. Oh, yeah, I cancel my account. I left. It was taking too much time

478
00:37:13.82 --> 00:37:19.82
It wouldn't be like oh my gosh, are you oh is every you know people like oh price aren't around. Yeah

479
00:37:20.82 --> 00:37:26.82
There's probably only a handful of people that would notice to be honest with you for most of us. Yeah, yeah for sure be like oh whatever

480
00:37:26.82 --> 00:37:32.82
And and the same thing I the likes and the follows and the comments and the subscribers and all that stuff. It's like oh whatever

481
00:37:33.82 --> 00:37:35.82
Well, it doesn't really matter

482
00:37:35.82 --> 00:37:38.82
Not that big of a deal, but if you think that's a big deal

483
00:37:39.82 --> 00:37:42.82
And something happens with it. That's a problem

484
00:37:44.82 --> 00:37:46.82
That's a problem

485
00:37:46.82 --> 00:37:53.82
So when you're investing a lot into a game make sure that it's the right game

486
00:37:53.82 --> 00:37:58.82
And if this game really matters

487
00:38:01.82 --> 00:38:05.82
And then figure out if you should be actually playing this game or not

488
00:38:06.82 --> 00:38:10.82
Or how long you gonna play it for what are you gonna invest in it? You can play a different game

489
00:38:11.82 --> 00:38:13.82
Maybe you can pursue what you truly want to pursue

490
00:38:15.82 --> 00:38:17.82
And what we have to be careful of

491
00:38:17.82 --> 00:38:19.82
When you start asking these questions

492
00:38:23.82 --> 00:38:25.82
You can't lie to yourself

493
00:38:27.82 --> 00:38:32.82
Because this is where this is where real problems begin

494
00:38:34.82 --> 00:38:36.82
So I got I was in a few years ago

495
00:38:37.82 --> 00:38:39.82
2020 because it was a jockeau live event. It was in New York

496
00:38:41.82 --> 00:38:43.82
And a guy asked a question, you know

497
00:38:43.82 --> 00:38:45.82
He said hey, you guys fired up

498
00:38:47.82 --> 00:38:49.82
He says hey, you know, I got a good job

499
00:38:49.82 --> 00:38:51.82
I make really good money

500
00:38:51.82 --> 00:38:55.82
I have a happy family. I got a wife and two kids 2.5 kids whatever it was

501
00:38:55.82 --> 00:38:57.82
You know, so you had a good life. He's explaining

502
00:38:58.82 --> 00:39:02.82
He said, you know, I just can't find the motivation to get up in the morning and do more

503
00:39:06.82 --> 00:39:08.82
And as I thought through this

504
00:39:08.82 --> 00:39:15.82
I told him he is very well the reason he's asking this question is because he's lying to himself

505
00:39:16.82 --> 00:39:18.82
And he's lying to himself

506
00:39:19.82 --> 00:39:22.82
He's lying it to himself in one of two ways

507
00:39:22.82 --> 00:39:26.82
The first way that he could be lying to himself is he's lying to himself

508
00:39:27.82 --> 00:39:33.82
That he wants to do more that to lie like I really want to get up and I want to get up and I want to get up

509
00:39:33.82 --> 00:39:38.82
I want to do more that's a lie like I really want to get up and I want to do more

510
00:39:39.82 --> 00:39:41.82
There's a chance that that's a lie

511
00:39:43.82 --> 00:39:52.82
Because if it's really there when you feel that lack of achievement when you feel that you could do more when you know you're not reaching your potential

512
00:39:52.82 --> 00:40:03.82
That eats you up. You don't need to find a motivation motivation finds you you can't sleep because you want to do more

513
00:40:03.82 --> 00:40:09.82
So there's a chance that this guy's lying to himself about the fact that he wants to do more

514
00:40:10.82 --> 00:40:16.82
And he's actually content the other lie that he could tell could be telling is that he's when he says he's happy

515
00:40:16.82 --> 00:40:22.82
And he has a good job and he has great money and he has a happy family. There's a chance that

516
00:40:25.82 --> 00:40:28.82
That doesn't really exist there's a chance that

517
00:40:30.82 --> 00:40:36.82
That if all that stuff was good to go he wouldn't really feel the need to want to do more

518
00:40:37.82 --> 00:40:41.82
So he's looking at it probably you know hey, I'm totally good to go. No you're not

519
00:40:41.82 --> 00:40:46.82
So tell the truth about that be like you know what I'm making good money, but I want to make more money on set my kids up for life

520
00:40:46.82 --> 00:40:49.82
I want to take a better care of my wife. I want to be able to spend I want to be able to get a vacate

521
00:40:49.82 --> 00:40:53.82
Whatever those things are tell the truth and if you tell the truth about those things you go

522
00:40:53.82 --> 00:40:58.82
You know what if I want to get another home if I want to get a vacation home. I need to work

523
00:40:58.82 --> 00:41:01.82
I need to bust my ass. I need to break out. I need to get up early. I need to do more stuff

524
00:41:01.82 --> 00:41:15.82
And listen there's some people that are totally happy and content with the rents covered the car payments handled

525
00:41:15.82 --> 00:41:19.82
The Netflix account is paid off right we're good. Yeah

526
00:41:21.82 --> 00:41:27.82
That's not supposed to elicit a hell yeah for me but there's people like this and then there's nothing wrong with that

527
00:41:27.82 --> 00:41:32.82
There's nothing wrong with that if that's where you're at and you're like hey look I got a rent got a cool place

528
00:41:32.82 --> 00:41:40.82
I got you know I got a I got my Netflix covered I got you know got a cool car. We're all good got a nice girlfriend

529
00:41:40.82 --> 00:41:48.82
We're all good there's people that legitimately are content with that there's also people that say we're all good and they're not

530
00:41:48.82 --> 00:41:55.82
They're lying to themselves so don't lie to yourself and in this case

531
00:41:55.82 --> 00:42:04.82
And in this case that I was talking to this guy from New York most likely the lie is contentment

532
00:42:04.82 --> 00:42:12.82
Most likely he's not as happy as he wants to be most likely he has unreached potential that's a serious issue for a lot of people

533
00:42:12.82 --> 00:42:20.82
And the older you get the stronger that grows right when you look at yourself in the mirror and you know time has passed

534
00:42:20.82 --> 00:42:27.82
That you wasted that starts to eat at you that can start to eat at you and so here's what I told this guy said listen

535
00:42:27.82 --> 00:42:33.82
Discipline that you're looking for that motivation that discipline that you're looking for discipline is rooted in the truth we tell ourselves

536
00:42:35.82 --> 00:42:42.82
Discipline is rooted in the truth that we tell ourselves and this is J I had a couple weeks later I was doing a gig with JP

537
00:42:42.82 --> 00:42:51.82
JP to now and I told you know we were having a discussion about where he was at and I told him the same thing discipline is rooted in the truth we tell ourselves

538
00:42:51.82 --> 00:43:03.82
If you tell yourself the truth you'll find discipline and actually if you tell yourself the truth most likely discipline will find you

539
00:43:03.82 --> 00:43:16.82
So do not lie to yourself do not lie to yourself and believe it or not we tend to do that we tend to just say I'm actually pretty happy

540
00:43:16.82 --> 00:43:30.82
I'm actually pretty happy we tend to tell ourselves a lie either that and your lie could be I want more and I want to do more

541
00:43:30.82 --> 00:43:35.82
That could be a lie you could be content with where you're at or your lie is that I'm happy

542
00:43:35.82 --> 00:43:45.82
And by the way if you want more go freaking get it and if you're happy cool enjoy it if you get if you pull that truth out of yourself

543
00:43:45.82 --> 00:43:56.82
And you know what I'm freaking stoked I got a I got a house I got a girlfriend I got Netflix I'm good if that's where you get cool enjoy it

544
00:43:56.82 --> 00:44:15.82
But don't lie to yourself and here's what you got to watch out for people lie about the hard games people lie about the hard games people lie about you know I don't really care about money

545
00:44:15.82 --> 00:44:25.82
It's freaking hard to make money and so people lie about it or you know I don't really I don't want to I don't want to spend my whole life working I don't care how big I am

546
00:44:25.82 --> 00:44:38.82
I don't care how strong I am it's a lie yeah not in all cases but in a lot of cases I don't really care about having I want to want some big house then you just got to take care of it

547
00:44:38.82 --> 00:44:50.82
Okay that could be a lie put your lie detector on if the goal that you're talking about you don't care about is big and takes hard work put your lie detector on it and make sure you're not lying to yourself

548
00:44:50.82 --> 00:45:15.82
If you don't care if you truly don't care that's cool that's fine but if you do care don't lie to yourself now you might have to put some realistic goals on yourself right you might have to be like okay I'm not happy with where I'm at this is what I want you know I want a freaking mansion

549
00:45:15.82 --> 00:45:30.82
Or I want I want a I want a house on beachfront Malibu 20 mil by the way that might not be a realistic goal for you but if you're like well you know I don't really care about that so I'm good with my apartment over here

550
00:45:30.82 --> 00:45:41.82
I'm good at renting my apartment over here if that's really if you really like look at your life and you look at your game and you look at your plan and you look at your where you're going to be and you're like I like renting an apartment and this is where I'm truly happy

551
00:45:41.82 --> 00:45:49.82
Okay but I'm asking you please don't lie to yourself

552
00:45:49.82 --> 00:46:07.82
This happens with with people going through seal training they say they want to be a seal they sign up for six years of their lives they tell all their friends that they're going to be a seal they tell their girlfriend they're going to be a seal they tell their parents and their grandparents they're going to be a seal

553
00:46:07.82 --> 00:46:34.82
And then it gets cold and they decide they don't really care about being a seal it's not really not really for me it's not true it's a lie and they quit and then two days later or two hours later they're like damn I know I actually do I do want to do that yeah but at the moment of truth you lie to yourself

554
00:46:34.82 --> 00:46:57.82
So that's what we end up doing a lot we end up doing a lot of lying to ourselves about the game that we're playing about the game that we want to play about the game that we should play and we don't tell ourselves the truth about it

555
00:46:57.82 --> 00:47:12.82
This is also why it's very important to be able to take a step back and detach because your little conniving mind will outsmart you

556
00:47:12.82 --> 00:47:30.82
It will outsmart you and it'll agree with the fact that you really don't care about you know having a good relationship with this girl or this guy or it'll say you know what I don't really care about getting advanced at work because I'm good with where I'm at

557
00:47:30.82 --> 00:47:56.82
Your mind will tell you that and you gotta watch out because your mind is smart it knows how to manipulate you, knows what to say so pay attention to the game that you're playing select the right game and make sure that you don't lie to yourself

558
00:47:56.82 --> 00:48:04.82
So the lying to yourself like that goes super deep like lying to yourself about like

559
00:48:04.82 --> 00:48:06.82
Did I hit a nerve over there?

560
00:48:06.82 --> 00:48:17.82
Yeah you did actually kind of but you know and you make this joke sometimes where you're talking about 20 rep squat and you're like I don't even know if I care about being strong

561
00:48:17.82 --> 00:48:27.82
No you're giving me a little bit too much like niceness I'm really like doing a 20 rep squat I don't even care about being this is stupid

562
00:48:27.82 --> 00:48:37.82
That weak part of my brain gets aggressive like dude this is you're gonna get hurt and you're not gonna be able to roll you're not gonna be able to surf

563
00:48:37.82 --> 00:48:58.82
How big do you want it how strong do you need to be bro? It's so easy and the thing is that like that and that's why I was kind of laughing because I thought about that and I have some pretty bad ones as well where you know and the lie is that like you don't really care that much about being strong

564
00:48:58.82 --> 00:49:13.82
The thing is like being strong is important only says been important you just don't want to fucking suffer right there. Hey check this out if you went into the gym and someone's like at that moment and they're like if they break and they go you know I don't really care about being strong

565
00:49:13.82 --> 00:49:23.82
And then you're like hey here's a pill you can take it'll make you freaking super strong 100% of people are taking it there's no one that says I don't want that pill. There's people that are willing to make the sacrifice

566
00:49:23.82 --> 00:49:33.82
Yes and let's face it dude you do those 20 rep squats bro. Yeah that's a that's a like a site it can be like a psychedelic experience like you know when you get to like the

567
00:49:33.82 --> 00:49:41.82
I thought you were gonna say psychotraumatic experience. No. Well I don't know I guess depends on who you are depends on how much weight you're doing depends on how you feel

568
00:49:41.82 --> 00:49:53.82
But yes psychedelic but what you just said there was like they don't want to make the sacrifice right and that sacrifice looks like that's a bunch of different things depending on what you're doing but really that's the truth but that's a hard truth to say

569
00:49:53.82 --> 00:50:09.82
It's like it seems way more comforting to be like it's not really that worth it because when something's not worth it and it's like clear it's like yeah yeah like it's like yeah I could go to the store but it's not worth it for the whatever I'm trying to get or whatever like that's easy that's an easy one to accept

570
00:50:09.82 --> 00:50:23.82
But if you're like yeah it is worth it and but right now I don't want to endure that suffering I'm too like mentally weak or whatever you want to you know whatever the situation is like I'm too mentally weak to go through that suffering for this 25 seconds

571
00:50:23.82 --> 00:50:33.82
That's hard. What's funny is you never say I'm too mentally weak to go through this because if you say that you're not you actually you actually what you'll say is like I don't you know I don't think I should get injured

572
00:50:33.82 --> 00:50:48.82
I don't think I should push myself. You got all these other excuses that you'll make and what's what what we have to watch out for is we can propel ourselves down the path in life of getting on the easiest game

573
00:50:48.82 --> 00:50:57.82
Exactly. You can say hey here's the easiest path to take that's a good enough game for me and listen this is what you got to watch out for

574
00:50:57.82 --> 00:51:12.82
You got to watch out for unutilized potential that you have as a human being if you have unutilized potential as a human being that's what ends up in my opinion becoming regret

575
00:51:12.82 --> 00:51:27.82
That becomes resentment towards other people as well. You ever you know we talked about this on the last podcast of like oh your friends don't want you to succeed there's some friends that don't want you to succeed

576
00:51:27.82 --> 00:51:38.82
That's because they know that they didn't do what they were supposed to do. You ever see someone like doing something that's hardcore and you're like a little bit jealous and mad and like frustrated

577
00:51:38.82 --> 00:51:44.82
I feel like I probably have yes but I can't think of anything offhand but I understand what you're saying

578
00:51:44.82 --> 00:51:52.82
When I'm when you see like oh uh Jaco like I post oh I just got done training Jiu Jitsu and you didn't are you a little bit mad?

579
00:51:52.82 --> 00:51:54.82
Yeah a little bit

580
00:51:54.82 --> 00:51:55.82
Right?

581
00:51:55.82 --> 00:51:56.82
Sometimes

582
00:51:56.82 --> 00:52:03.82
A little bit mad because it's a reflection of you. You decided not to train. That was your choice

583
00:52:03.82 --> 00:52:04.82
Yeah

584
00:52:04.82 --> 00:52:16.82
Yeah it's getting personal. You know what's real funny about that is like that you're right in you're right in probably more ways than you think because sometimes I'll be like ah he didn't call me to go train

585
00:52:16.82 --> 00:52:27.82
You know how sometimes you'll be like text and be like training news time or whatever and then like then I'll see whatever someone posts a picture of themselves with you training and I'm like ah it's like it's almost like a justification

586
00:52:27.82 --> 00:52:37.82
You know I'm like ah he didn't call me but whatever you know kind of thing but really the real pain is like that I just didn't go training you know that you did and I didn't

587
00:52:37.82 --> 00:52:50.82
So imagine that over a lifetime. Like we're talking about one training session makes you feel a little bit but imagine you look up and you know that someone else who's pretty much the same level human as you

588
00:52:50.82 --> 00:52:57.82
Like look I look at some people like Dan that person's doing I don't have the capability of doing what they're doing in that arena like whatever that arena is

589
00:52:57.82 --> 00:53:05.82
Freakin Tom Brady right? What's this dude doing? Like there's a human that was built for that game

590
00:53:05.82 --> 00:53:21.82
Gordon Ryan right? This is a human that's built for that game and both those guys massive work ethic dedication just that's what they're good that's what that's the game that they're playing

591
00:53:21.82 --> 00:53:24.82
And they've committed to that game and they're born for that game

592
00:53:24.82 --> 00:53:38.82
So I'm over here I'm not looking at Gordon Ryan like frustrated about him I might be like damn bro I might be like that dude is I actually it's just actually I know I'm trying to think of what my emotions are

593
00:53:38.82 --> 00:53:53.82
When I look at Tom Brady or I look at Michael Jordan or I look at Gordon Ryan it's like oh that's a human that got the blessing of having a level of natural ability that then took it to the nth degree

594
00:53:53.82 --> 00:54:09.82
Good for them bro. Respect. I don't even feel frustrated about that. Here's where people get frustrated. They look at Joe Schmo and they go dude Joe Schmo did this and I'm sitting over here and that person did better than me

595
00:54:09.82 --> 00:54:22.82
I know I have more talent than them. That's where people get pissed. That's where people get resentful. Yeah that's what it feels like where like yeah you mentioned these like elite level you know Gordon Ryan and Michael Jordan and Tom Brady

596
00:54:22.82 --> 00:54:36.82
It's almost like they're so good and so like they have they connected all their dots in their whole life potential gifts and work ethic and like you don't even compare yourself with them because of all these elements that are different

597
00:54:36.82 --> 00:54:47.82
So like you know when someone's like in the same lane as you that's when you're going to be paying attention you know where certain people even if someone's like just playing a whole different game like someone who's like won the Nobel Prize

598
00:54:47.82 --> 00:55:04.82
There are other people in their in their little environment and their ecosystem yeah their ecosystem that they're like I should have won the Nobel Prize or they'll be hater I should whatever but you if you're not pursuing the Nobel Prize you're kind of like oh that's pretty impressive you know you don't care at all you're just not in that lane you know

599
00:55:04.82 --> 00:55:29.82
What's the deal with Tom Brady as far as like you know you see these the numbers that he did in the combine when he was getting drafted and he was like not you know horrible numbers I think like the worst 40 and they show pictures of him he had no vertical so was he just not like the best athlete and then he got he worked to get that athletic or he just not been on the right program

600
00:55:29.82 --> 00:55:42.82
So what's the deal with Tom Brady is Tom Brady super athletic now or something I mean he's freaking one however many Super Bowls yeah so awesome shape at 45 years old yeah yeah fully so yeah there's and you know this like where there's different like types of athlete

601
00:55:42.82 --> 00:56:02.82
But more than that it's more what kind of player are you like how good of a player are you so certain positions if you're more athletic that's going to add to how good of a player you got to have other elements for sure oh yeah 100% now quarterback is kind of the most cerebral one of the thing so he's he got to be he has to be a good football player like quarterback

602
00:56:02.82 --> 00:56:15.82
so there's something in his mind and you can train all this stuff like in and of course physically like he's a tall guy you know that helps and you got physical attributes for sure but just because you don't have a vertical like that's more like basketball your vertical

603
00:56:15.82 --> 00:56:31.82
I mean he's got to be more than a quarterback do you think he do you think he was not on the right program and then once he started getting honed he was able to become more because let's face it like he could have been a really good athlete that just didn't know how to train right yeah is that possible yeah yeah very

604
00:56:31.82 --> 00:56:47.82
yeah but you tend to get like these really good and I told you about my friend Tim Kerry where he he was a quarterback at UH he actually talked to him briefly he was he I think he played in Canada for a little bit too but and I'm not saying he's not a Tom Brady level

605
00:56:47.82 --> 00:57:05.82
athlete but he was so but he was one of those guys where you tell him around a 40 he's not very fast he was pretty tall but you tell him jump a vertical he's not going to be one of the highest vertical guys you know but his mind and his just way of connecting with the people around him on the team or whatever was like you could tell he was really good at that

606
00:57:05.82 --> 00:57:17.82
and I'm sure you can train that a lot of it is like personality but it's like the way you're in touch with the game and with your game that's going to really tell the tale more so than how fast you run the 40 or do those combine exercises

607
00:57:17.82 --> 00:57:37.82
and so on thing about Fader when people talk about the different towns that people have right and you got you know some fighter is super explosive right you got a yo lol Romero right just explosive he's like a superhero explosive you got some other guy that can you

608
00:57:37.82 --> 00:57:43.54
Nate Diaz is going Durance, bro. He's gonna he's gonna keep going nothing gonna stop him from an endurance perspective

609
00:57:44.34 --> 00:57:50.32
BJPan flexible super flexible you got guys that just cardio machines Frankie Edgar, right?

610
00:57:50.32 --> 00:57:56.96
So there's different people have different talents what I always found about Fedor Mellon ankle who a lot of people say is

611
00:57:57.10 --> 00:57:59.10
The best heavyweight of all time

612
00:57:59.86 --> 00:58:04.60
In mixed martial arts what I I thought like his talent

613
00:58:04.60 --> 00:58:11.32
Was that he knew how to fight really good, you know like he knew how to take his wrestling his boxing his striking his grappling

614
00:58:11.32 --> 00:58:15.96
He knew how to take all those things his talent was being able to put them all into one

615
00:58:16.44 --> 00:58:22.92
Into one package and utilize the right skill at the right time. Yeah better than anyone else dirt in his era

616
00:58:23.24 --> 00:58:29.12
Yeah, and you know here's another one too and you mentioned this everyone's well where he was unshakable like he wasn't the kind where like

617
00:58:29.12 --> 00:58:34.32
You get him in trouble and it that means something to that you get a minchal means nothing to you nothing

618
00:58:34.32 --> 00:58:37.72
Yeah, look at Kevin Randleman just picking him up

619
00:58:38.44 --> 00:58:46.56
Smashing him on his spine. Yeah, like where you look at air airborne airborne and you think there you think at least there's a decent chance

620
00:58:46.56 --> 00:58:48.56
This guy's and he's gonna be paralyzed

621
00:58:48.68 --> 00:58:53.76
Yeah, I'll literally paralyzed from the neck down because he gets smashed on his head and he hits the ground

622
00:58:53.76 --> 00:58:58.62
He looks like it looks like I just walked up to you and like said hi. That's the expression

623
00:58:58.62 --> 00:59:01.76
Yep, he just looks totally normal and he gets a guy in a Camero

624
00:59:02.44 --> 00:59:08.12
But that you see that and you go, okay, that's what that guy's talent was

625
00:59:08.48 --> 00:59:12.80
Was taking all those things like he if there was no MMA and there was just boxing

626
00:59:12.80 --> 00:59:16.76
He wouldn't have been a world champion boxer if there was just wrestling he wouldn't have been world champion wrestler

627
00:59:17.40 --> 00:59:20.28
Because there was people that would beat him in wrestling. There's people that beat him in boxing

628
00:59:20.28 --> 00:59:24.24
There's people that beat him in sombo, but you take all those things and put them together and he that's the skill he had

629
00:59:24.24 --> 00:59:26.34
Yeah, so when we're

630
00:59:26.34 --> 00:59:28.34
Cruising around life

631
00:59:29.46 --> 00:59:34.80
You if you can and you can identify what talent you have

632
00:59:36.02 --> 00:59:40.50
That can help you identify what game you should get into and

633
00:59:41.62 --> 00:59:43.62
if you're lucky

634
00:59:43.82 --> 00:59:49.50
The game that you're good at is the game that you also like to play right because there's some people that have a natural skill

635
00:59:49.50 --> 00:59:56.98
But they don't like that that game right there's also some people that lack a skill, but they love that game look

636
00:59:57.82 --> 01:00:01.86
I'm okay with that to an extent right like

637
01:00:02.46 --> 01:00:06.54
Hey, I really love this game. I suck at it, but I'm gonna go for it

638
01:00:07.58 --> 01:00:08.70
Appreciate the heart man

639
01:00:08.70 --> 01:00:13.38
And you you you that might be the right move for you because then you're doing something that you love and you get beat

640
01:00:13.38 --> 01:00:20.46
It doesn't really matter as long as you accept that and you understand that and you understand what winning is gonna look like for you

641
01:00:20.46 --> 01:00:23.82
In that particular game, but if you're not paying attention to that

642
01:00:24.30 --> 01:00:28.46
You might be getting involved. You might be it's the same thing you hear with you know

643
01:00:28.46 --> 01:00:34.18
I just always did what my parents wanted me to do and that's why I went to law school and now I'm a lawyer and I hate it

644
01:00:34.74 --> 01:00:37.62
Right like watch out for that

645
01:00:38.10 --> 01:00:41.38
If you don't like if that's not the game you want to play at all

646
01:00:41.38 --> 01:00:47.14
And your parents are getting your law school and you want to be a welder because you like fabricating stuff with your hands

647
01:00:47.54 --> 01:00:50.86
Let me tell you what game you should pick you should pick that fabrication

648
01:00:51.38 --> 01:00:59.14
You should become a welder because your passion and your love for welding will more than make up for the fact that it might start off with a

649
01:00:59.14 --> 01:01:05.30
Lower income than being a lawyer, which by the way, probably isn't even true these days because you know lawyer

650
01:01:05.30 --> 01:01:09.70
There's so many lawyers out there. It takes a long time to build up your life

651
01:01:09.70 --> 01:01:14.54
You you book a business and it depends on what kind of lawyer you are like

652
01:01:14.54 --> 01:01:20.34
I know a handful of lawyers and most of them are don't make that much money. That's very true very true and

653
01:01:21.02 --> 01:01:22.70
most welders

654
01:01:22.70 --> 01:01:24.70
They make pretty good money

655
01:01:25.62 --> 01:01:29.22
So that's what game you want to get in yeah

656
01:01:29.22 --> 01:01:35.54
And you in you and you just you just have to pay attention yourself and what I would say about both those

657
01:01:36.02 --> 01:01:38.94
Your parents want you to be a lawyer. They've told you to be a lawyer

658
01:01:38.94 --> 01:01:40.46
if

659
01:01:40.46 --> 01:01:42.46
You lie to yourself

660
01:01:42.46 --> 01:01:44.46
And they're gonna work out well

661
01:01:45.10 --> 01:01:50.98
You made a really good point with the admirals and stuff where and then UFC has that where you know

662
01:01:50.98 --> 01:01:55.30
You put all your eggs in that basket playing that game hardcore and then once it's over you're sort of done

663
01:01:55.74 --> 01:01:57.86
so I know like

664
01:01:58.50 --> 01:01:59.50
You know

665
01:01:59.50 --> 01:02:05.66
Professional sports that can be the case and you know you ever watch that what's the show the rock used to be in and he was like a sports

666
01:02:05.66 --> 01:02:10.34
Financial advisor no idea. He was it was a show I used to watch it for a while

667
01:02:10.34 --> 01:02:14.38
I was and I was like I don't get what this guy is that when I first started watching it

668
01:02:14.38 --> 01:02:19.50
And I was like oh what he does is he manages like the money in the financial future of

669
01:02:19.98 --> 01:02:23.38
Athletes that come in cuz you know you come out of high school

670
01:02:23.38 --> 01:02:29.38
Yeah, he squeaked out a degree a little bit you into the draft or whatever in your hole your whole plan for your whole life

671
01:02:29.38 --> 01:02:33.86
All your eggs in that basket football and then nothing else afterwards right in your playing football

672
01:02:33.86 --> 01:02:38.94
That's all you're doing football party whatever whatever so the rock was like an advisor

673
01:02:38.94 --> 01:02:42.58
They would he would help plan like hey shit you should take some your money invested here

674
01:02:42.58 --> 01:02:45.74
So when you're done playing football because when play football you don't think about after football

675
01:02:45.74 --> 01:02:52.10
I'm missing forget football forever well unfortunately most people between the most men for sure between the ages of 1530

676
01:02:53.06 --> 01:02:59.22
Aren't thinking about anything. Yeah, you all think you're gonna not you're not worried about hey something will happen

677
01:02:59.22 --> 01:03:01.50
Yeah, which is by the way lying to yourself. Yes

678
01:03:01.94 --> 01:03:03.54
so too

679
01:03:03.54 --> 01:03:08.06
So he was he would do that and that like kind of man you can

680
01:03:08.62 --> 01:03:13.98
Obviously, we don't have a lot of us don't have financial advisors when we get our first great job, you know

681
01:03:14.18 --> 01:03:18.34
But it's like that's the kind of mindset you kind of got to keep that's gonna help you

682
01:03:18.34 --> 01:03:23.62
You know like what mindset that hey this is gonna end this job is gonna end and then what am I gonna do?

683
01:03:23.62 --> 01:03:29.66
So some jobs are good where you can have that job and you get so much experience just by doing the job that like when you're done

684
01:03:29.66 --> 01:03:34.10
You're like oh shoot to me Admiral seems like one of those jobs. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah

685
01:03:34.10 --> 01:03:39.66
No, there's definitely like I said the military and industrial complex is looking to hire you up and make you a freaking whatever

686
01:03:39.90 --> 01:03:45.54
They're thing and they're board meeting and you're gonna go to the big meeting and get more missiles bought by

687
01:03:46.06 --> 01:03:47.54
Navy or whatever

688
01:03:47.54 --> 01:03:52.86
That's going on for sure, but you'll see fight not guaranteed by the way what I just said

689
01:03:53.54 --> 01:03:57.54
There's always a slot. There's always some slots for that flag officer

690
01:03:57.54 --> 01:04:00.78
But also that flag officer is like well, they're like, yeah, yeah

691
01:04:00.78 --> 01:04:03.22
We got a job for you just got to move to whatever this place is and the guys like well

692
01:04:03.22 --> 01:04:05.34
I wanted to retire to Tennessee like well

693
01:04:05.86 --> 01:04:09.82
We don't need someone in Tennessee. We need someone in Washington, DC, Tennessee or DC

694
01:04:10.26 --> 01:04:17.18
We need you in DC not Tennessee and so then they're like, oh, I guess I'll just not do that and look you're got an admirals

695
01:04:17.50 --> 01:04:23.06
You got an admirals pay admirals retirement or a generals retirement, which is good money

696
01:04:23.06 --> 01:04:29.94
But it's not getting you anything close to the life that you had when you were an active duty general officer

697
01:04:29.94 --> 01:04:36.34
Because you had a driver and you had a car and you had a freaking airplane. Yeah, you aren't flying around in Delta

698
01:04:36.82 --> 01:04:39.06
You're not flying around in America. You had a plane

699
01:04:39.66 --> 01:04:42.46
And you're just hey, bro. I'm going there now. I'm going there now

700
01:04:42.46 --> 01:04:47.86
There's a group of people waiting for you and they're feeding you extravagant foods and treat treating with respect all of a sudden next thing

701
01:04:47.86 --> 01:04:51.82
You know you're on Delta Airlines in the cheap seats

702
01:04:51.82 --> 01:04:56.38
Mmm, you know, so that's where it sneaks up on people

703
01:04:56.38 --> 01:05:01.90
Yeah, and there's people that do that in every industry that happens in in the in the academics

704
01:05:01.90 --> 01:05:04.98
It happens in the financial industry. It happens in any industry

705
01:05:04.98 --> 01:05:11.50
Yeah, any any job that you can have if you don't recognize the ecosystem that that job

706
01:05:11.74 --> 01:05:17.70
Actually encompasses and think that it encompasses more if you think that the ecosystem encompasses the whole world

707
01:05:17.70 --> 01:05:24.22
Yeah, like there's like being a seal, right? No one like there's an admiral seal

708
01:05:24.70 --> 01:05:29.30
There's me. There's some other guy that was did four years to necessarily in world. That's just a seal

709
01:05:29.30 --> 01:05:35.30
They're all the same dude, right? Well, this guy was an admiral. Sure. Some people might say well admiral sounds pretty important

710
01:05:35.54 --> 01:05:38.76
Well, this guy over here says yeah, I was a master chief goes

711
01:05:39.46 --> 01:05:44.34
Master chief admiral those guys both sound pretty awesome to me. Yeah, right. It's like the same thing

712
01:05:44.34 --> 01:05:51.14
Yeah, so you think that that ecosystem expands to encompass the whole universe and you think it expands to encompass life

713
01:05:51.14 --> 01:05:52.90
It doesn't yeah

714
01:05:52.90 --> 01:05:54.90
So if you're not paying attention

715
01:05:55.42 --> 01:06:02.06
You will be invested in a game where when you walk off the court, no one cares what the score was

716
01:06:02.06 --> 01:06:06.86
Yeah, people do that with academia like you're going to college and they're trying to get good grades and all this stuff

717
01:06:06.86 --> 01:06:10.42
No one cares. No one wants to see your report card. Actually a lot of times

718
01:06:10.42 --> 01:06:15.38
They don't even care what university went to sure if you went to the big whatever big Ivy League

719
01:06:15.38 --> 01:06:19.14
There's people that care about that, but then there's also be like, I don't care where you went to school

720
01:06:19.42 --> 01:06:24.42
Whatever you went to Harvard you went to Princeton you went to Berkeley went to Yale you went to wherever it's okay

721
01:06:24.42 --> 01:06:28.42
Cool, whatever we don't care. Can you perform in this job? Yeah, and that's the question

722
01:06:29.26 --> 01:06:35.30
So if we're not thinking about that we end up with issues. That's why you know, I've told vets for all these years

723
01:06:35.30 --> 01:06:40.34
You need to find a new mission find a new mission because that once you're out of the military

724
01:06:40.34 --> 01:06:47.38
No one calls you master chief anymore. Yeah, no one calls you commander anymore. It doesn't happen

725
01:06:48.18 --> 01:06:53.74
Sure, you can go to the country club and someone calls you Admiral if you tell them all about it

726
01:06:53.74 --> 01:06:57.30
But they they're just kind of like whatever. It's no big deal

727
01:06:58.14 --> 01:07:01.86
So we have to be careful about this, you know the the UFC thing for sure is

728
01:07:01.86 --> 01:07:09.26
The you know guys that fought in the UFC and then that's over, you know even Jiu Jitsu guys like oh, that's over

729
01:07:09.26 --> 01:07:13.98
Like you just said football guys like you're on you're on an NFL football team

730
01:07:14.78 --> 01:07:18.06
Nowadays cool. You're gonna get a good retirement. You're gonna be taking care of but back in the day

731
01:07:18.54 --> 01:07:24.46
Back in the 70s like you got done. No, no, you don't have any money. Yeah, no one cares gotta go get a job

732
01:07:24.46 --> 01:07:28.18
Yeah, you got to go get an actual job. That's weird. That's a strange thing. Yeah

733
01:07:28.18 --> 01:07:35.06
Actually, yeah, my uncle he died, but he played in the NFL for like six years or whatever what team

734
01:07:36.26 --> 01:07:41.70
Kind of played for Cleveland and he's old school. He's like eight. He would have been like 80. Oh, damn

735
01:07:41.70 --> 01:07:43.70
He was old 70s hardcore

736
01:07:44.26 --> 01:07:45.86
helmet

737
01:07:45.86 --> 01:07:47.86
Not quite but nonetheless

738
01:07:48.42 --> 01:07:53.30
When I first I heard about him when I first when I first met him when he came to visit or whatever

739
01:07:53.30 --> 01:07:56.98
He was like, yeah, he was like just a normal dude. I thought you know, he's huge

740
01:07:56.98 --> 01:08:01.38
But he was like, um, I thought it was gonna be some big-time rich dude

741
01:08:01.94 --> 01:08:05.78
Cuz he got that NFL money, you know, but no like when you're done

742
01:08:05.78 --> 01:08:11.54
You sort of got I mean unless you're focused right when you get that you focus on retirement and invest

743
01:08:11.54 --> 01:08:14.90
You know, that's that most people don't do that. So he just came as just a normal dude

744
01:08:14.90 --> 01:08:19.02
Mm-hmm. I think he'd worked in like I don't know some actually I think he owned like a

745
01:08:19.62 --> 01:08:25.22
Shop person. Yeah, but what's interesting is if you were in the NFL back then

746
01:08:25.22 --> 01:08:27.22
Or you in the UFC

747
01:08:27.78 --> 01:08:29.78
Five years ago ten years ago

748
01:08:29.86 --> 01:08:33.78
And you recognized the limitations of the game you were investing in

749
01:08:34.66 --> 01:08:40.10
And you pulled chips off the table in that game and put it into the bigger game. Yeah, that's how you win

750
01:08:40.66 --> 01:08:43.86
That's how you look up and go. Yeah, you know, I've didn't you know, I didn't do great in the UFC

751
01:08:43.86 --> 01:08:45.86
I fought for the belt twice didn't win it

752
01:08:46.42 --> 01:08:51.54
But I you know bought these three apartment buildings. Yeah, you know over a five-year period

753
01:08:51.54 --> 01:08:54.98
Yeah, two of them are paid for you know what I mean and then all of a sudden you go, oh

754
01:08:56.02 --> 01:08:57.14
so

755
01:08:57.14 --> 01:09:01.86
The only way you get to see that is by following the advice we gave on the last podcast

756
01:09:01.94 --> 01:09:05.78
Take a step back and write down the game that you're in and the multiple games that you're in

757
01:09:06.10 --> 01:09:08.18
And then what are the strategies to win these games?

758
01:09:08.58 --> 01:09:13.54
Yeah, and by the way, you can be playing a game a short-term game a subordinate game

759
01:09:14.82 --> 01:09:19.22
That is going to cost you in the strategic victory of the supreme game. Yeah

760
01:09:19.22 --> 01:09:21.22
Yeah, so you're doing dumb things

761
01:09:22.26 --> 01:09:26.58
Hey, oh, I'm gonna deal some drugs right now, right? I want to deal some drugs and I want to make some money right now

762
01:09:26.66 --> 01:09:29.62
Blah blah blah blah then you get caught. Yeah, and now you're screwed

763
01:09:29.94 --> 01:09:33.30
Yeah, so you can do you can make mistakes

764
01:09:34.58 --> 01:09:39.94
In the short-term games you can get involved in games that don't matter you get involved in games that take away your resources

765
01:09:40.58 --> 01:09:42.82
And if you do that, you're gonna you're gonna

766
01:09:44.02 --> 01:09:46.02
sacrifice the supreme

767
01:09:46.02 --> 01:09:49.38
Game again, please go and write down

768
01:09:50.50 --> 01:09:55.62
Take a step back detach and write down the various games and subordinate games that you're involved in what look

769
01:09:55.62 --> 01:10:00.98
We're all playing at least one big game together. Yeah, all of us. Yeah, and you know for you

770
01:10:02.34 --> 01:10:05.06
Winning the game of life might be hey

771
01:10:06.02 --> 01:10:08.02
I've got a big family

772
01:10:08.02 --> 01:10:09.94
I've got a bunch of kids

773
01:10:09.94 --> 01:10:13.94
I've got a bunch of grandkids. That's a w. It might be hey

774
01:10:13.94 --> 01:10:17.30
I'm not really into a big family, but I got a bunch of properties and I got a

775
01:10:17.86 --> 01:10:23.30
Um, I know I can spend my final years doing whatever I want. That's your w. If that's your w fine

776
01:10:24.10 --> 01:10:25.94
Maybe it's hey, look, I don't really care about money

777
01:10:25.94 --> 01:10:30.50
But I want to live by the beach or I want to live in the mountains and I want to be left alone

778
01:10:30.74 --> 01:10:33.22
And not have to worry about anything and that's the w. Okay

779
01:10:34.18 --> 01:10:35.14
cool

780
01:10:35.14 --> 01:10:40.02
Figure out what that win looks like figure out what that w is and then figure out how you're gonna play that game to win

781
01:10:40.02 --> 01:10:44.02
And do you you know you heard the the whole thing where

782
01:10:44.82 --> 01:10:48.74
You know people do this where they'll interview people who are like really old

783
01:10:49.14 --> 01:10:55.86
And sometimes they interview like the super successful people who are really old and kind of retired or whatever and they say like what are your regrets or whatever

784
01:10:56.98 --> 01:11:00.02
And it's usually stuff that they didn't do or maybe I should have

785
01:11:01.46 --> 01:11:08.50
Okay, so I have two questions. Hey, do you ever uh like do that? Is that ever like a motive not a motivator, but like a um

786
01:11:08.50 --> 01:11:15.54
Like a tool you use to be like hey, I should do more or whatever by thinking like oh, I don't want to be old and

787
01:11:16.26 --> 01:11:23.86
Regret not doing certain things. Yeah, I think when I talked earlier about the knowing that you have a certain level of potential

788
01:11:25.06 --> 01:11:27.06
knowing that

789
01:11:27.22 --> 01:11:29.22
You have a certain amount of time

790
01:11:29.54 --> 01:11:33.62
Knowing that I have opportunities that some of my friends don't have anymore. It's like, oh

791
01:11:34.42 --> 01:11:36.58
If you don't think I'm gonna try and do my best to

792
01:11:36.58 --> 01:11:43.94
fulfill the potential that I have to to squeeze what I can out of life

793
01:11:45.38 --> 01:11:51.30
Well, yeah, no, of course, I think that way, you know, I think about all my friends that don't have that opportunity. Yeah, so

794
01:11:52.34 --> 01:11:54.10
Do you think of now?

795
01:11:54.10 --> 01:11:58.74
Do you ever think of like things in the past like that you kind of can't do anymore because you're not in that position anymore?

796
01:11:58.82 --> 01:12:00.82
You know like sometimes when you're like, hey, I should have

797
01:12:00.82 --> 01:12:06.18
I think I should have enjoyed myself more in my 20s or whatever. Do you ever think that I enjoyed myself a lot?

798
01:12:06.18 --> 01:12:10.26
So you don't have any other direction. I'm like, I enjoyed myself a little bit too much in my 20s

799
01:12:10.82 --> 01:12:14.02
You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I was I was playing that game pretty hard

800
01:12:14.10 --> 01:12:18.66
Yeah, right and I played it a little too hard, you know, I probably should have a little bit a little bit smarter

801
01:12:18.74 --> 01:12:20.74
but I think also

802
01:12:21.46 --> 01:12:26.82
You know, I I think that the years that I was like, you know blowing money on

803
01:12:26.82 --> 01:12:32.02
On partying and chicks and just all that crap. I think in those years. I also

804
01:12:33.30 --> 01:12:35.54
Those were years that were a little bit

805
01:12:36.50 --> 01:12:39.30
For lack of a better word a little bit expendable meaning like

806
01:12:40.42 --> 01:12:44.26
That's what I was doing. I knew I had a longer future, you know

807
01:12:44.82 --> 01:12:48.10
And knew I'd be able to kind of have some time to put that together

808
01:12:48.26 --> 01:12:53.46
But that being said, I've told my kids I've been like, oh if I would have been smarter

809
01:12:53.46 --> 01:12:58.50
The the whole the whole world would be different. You know, so I guess I do have

810
01:12:59.54 --> 01:13:01.54
When I if I think about it

811
01:13:01.62 --> 01:13:06.42
Front kind of bifurcate the two thoughts of one of them is like, well, yeah, I had a good time and it was fun

812
01:13:06.82 --> 01:13:10.50
But also if I look at it from a more mature aspect, it's like

813
01:13:11.22 --> 01:13:13.78
Yeah, you know, I would have been in a much better position

814
01:13:14.66 --> 01:13:15.70
now

815
01:13:15.70 --> 01:13:16.98
then

816
01:13:16.98 --> 01:13:19.46
Then I am now listen

817
01:13:19.46 --> 01:13:25.06
I will say that I'm in a really good position right now in my life. Like I mean, I've got good stuff going on

818
01:13:26.02 --> 01:13:28.02
I kind of have what I

819
01:13:28.66 --> 01:13:30.66
What I want. Yeah, um

820
01:13:31.70 --> 01:13:37.06
But you know, if I wouldn't have gotten onto this path that we're on right now

821
01:13:38.18 --> 01:13:43.38
You know, if I if I would have retired from the military and run the gym and taught jujitsu

822
01:13:43.38 --> 01:13:50.42
And I had to look around right now and look at the time and money that I wasted as a 20 to as an 18 19

823
01:13:50.42 --> 01:13:52.42
20 21 22 23 24 year old

824
01:13:52.42 --> 01:13:57.70
I'd be like, damn. I should I wasted a blue a lot of stuff. Luckily, like I said, I think of

825
01:13:58.18 --> 01:14:00.18
made maneuvers

826
01:14:00.42 --> 01:14:02.42
Once I identified

827
01:14:02.66 --> 01:14:04.66
The game that I was playing

828
01:14:05.06 --> 01:14:10.66
Which I didn't really do until I was like 25 years old. It's like, okay. I see this game. Okay. Now. I'm in a game

829
01:14:10.66 --> 01:14:14.58
Now I'm in a game. Here's the here's the maneuver. Here's the moves that I have to make

830
01:14:14.90 --> 01:14:17.94
Here's the things that I have to do to set myself up for the long run

831
01:14:18.50 --> 01:14:22.18
And once I did that then I was able to sort it out. But if I

832
01:14:23.78 --> 01:14:30.10
And then and then continued to identify. Oh, this is the game that's going on right now. Okay. Here's here's how I can make

833
01:14:30.10 --> 01:14:32.82
Moves. So I think if I wouldn't have identified that

834
01:14:34.90 --> 01:14:36.90
I would be totally regretful. Yeah

835
01:14:36.90 --> 01:14:42.42
Yeah, but as of right now, you're you're kind of saw I feel good and the other question I got asked yourself

836
01:14:42.42 --> 01:14:47.70
Well, if I didn't have those other experiences, would I be who I am right now? I mean the answer is probably no probably not

837
01:14:47.70 --> 01:14:49.70
Yeah, you know, so I I was

838
01:14:50.82 --> 01:14:55.94
Doing things and learning about life and going through experiences that I learned a lot from

839
01:14:56.98 --> 01:15:00.10
And I think that was beneficial. Yeah, and it makes me who I am

840
01:15:00.98 --> 01:15:05.38
So, yeah, I feel like you're you know in your position and a lot of people in the position where

841
01:15:05.38 --> 01:15:08.82
You have you had such a like action path for like a better term

842
01:15:09.62 --> 01:15:11.62
Yep, like young

843
01:15:11.86 --> 01:15:17.22
Life, you know that it's hard to be like man. I wish it because you know, you you bring up

844
01:15:18.02 --> 01:15:23.06
Yeah, people who follow their parents dreams, you know, and then they get and even one there for real successful

845
01:15:23.46 --> 01:15:29.54
They'll be like, dang, I wish I would have I wish I would have paid attention more to my friends or my whatever my family or whatever

846
01:15:29.86 --> 01:15:33.38
Or even if they just say I wish I would have followed my dreams instead of my parents dreams. Yeah

847
01:15:33.38 --> 01:15:38.18
Yeah, so this is to your case in point. I followed my dreams from day one

848
01:15:38.18 --> 01:15:43.22
Like on day one, I was like, hey, I want to go be a frogman. I'm gonna go get after it like that's what I'm doing and I did it

849
01:15:43.94 --> 01:15:45.94
And so that's to me

850
01:15:47.62 --> 01:15:49.62
Very

851
01:15:50.10 --> 01:15:51.54
Very

852
01:15:51.54 --> 01:15:59.54
Satisfying gratifying and regret removal, right? Yeah, fully like I think if I if I had not done what I had wanted to do

853
01:15:59.54 --> 01:16:04.18
Like well, you know, you played football. Is there a part of you that goes man?

854
01:16:04.18 --> 01:16:06.50
If I would have pushed a little bit harder if I would have trained a little bit harder

855
01:16:06.50 --> 01:16:10.34
If I would have been a little bit more dedicated, I probably could have you know, maybe I could have gone

856
01:16:11.06 --> 01:16:14.58
Whatever, maybe I could have gone to the NFL. Maybe I could have done or you don't have those thoughts

857
01:16:14.66 --> 01:16:20.02
No, you're shaking your head like that. Yeah, not even close. So I think like you didn't have the capability of going to the NFL

858
01:16:20.10 --> 01:16:22.26
Um, I don't I don't know

859
01:16:22.26 --> 01:16:29.22
I mean put it this way the guys that on my team that I know that went to the NFL were like way more gifted than me

860
01:16:29.78 --> 01:16:35.54
So way more gifted or way all across the board everything or did they work harder though? Yeah

861
01:16:35.86 --> 01:16:40.50
Yeah, both and here's what I realized like within two years. It was actually after I got injured

862
01:16:40.50 --> 01:16:42.90
I had to work my way back into the depth chart

863
01:16:43.54 --> 01:16:48.42
Is like I don't like football enough to like have to play this game as hard as everyone

864
01:16:48.42 --> 01:16:54.34
I'm looking around and guys are like they're down for the grind of football and that's football and they're watching the games on the weekends

865
01:16:54.34 --> 01:16:56.34
Oh, this one remember. I don't care. I kind of

866
01:16:57.14 --> 01:17:02.98
To be honest, I kind of care more about the party on after the game then, you know, like practice and like all this stuff

867
01:17:03.06 --> 01:17:08.10
I liked lifting weights. I like that part of it and certain like running drills. I like that part of it

868
01:17:08.18 --> 01:17:14.26
But I think the the reality of what it takes to play football like wasn't worth it at all

869
01:17:14.26 --> 01:17:19.78
To me after like about two years in college in high school

870
01:17:19.78 --> 01:17:25.38
It's like you're just into working out and you run faster than everybody so it's you can catch good

871
01:17:25.38 --> 01:17:29.70
So you make touchdowns if you're good at football in high school like you're just gonna live a good life

872
01:17:29.70 --> 01:17:35.22
You know kind of a thing and then so it wasn't it didn't take the kind of work it did in college

873
01:17:35.38 --> 01:17:40.98
So it really brings to light like what it takes and you're like, oh, bro. This isn't like I don't even like football that much

874
01:17:40.98 --> 01:17:46.42
I like it but not that much. What if you were still a bouncer right now? No, so yeah, would you kind of be like?

875
01:17:46.42 --> 01:17:52.10
Damn, I was I know I would if this is the if if I wasn't trying to see if you lied to yours

876
01:17:52.10 --> 01:17:55.86
Did you lie to yourself at all when you were like, you know what? I don't care about that much about football

877
01:17:55.86 --> 01:18:00.58
Were you just saying that because it was a bunch of hard work and you're like, oh, I don't really care about football

878
01:18:00.58 --> 01:18:03.14
It's like what I talked about earlier today. Yeah

879
01:18:06.10 --> 01:18:07.06
No

880
01:18:07.06 --> 01:18:11.54
Because it doesn't feel like in any way because I don't even know I don't watch football

881
01:18:11.78 --> 01:18:13.78
It's like I saw her grades or nothing

882
01:18:13.78 --> 01:18:15.78
But I like I'll try to watch football

883
01:18:16.26 --> 01:18:21.22
Because I want my son to kind of be into and think out because and it is fun to watch what I'm like not into it really

884
01:18:21.22 --> 01:18:23.22
I'm not into it. So there's

885
01:18:24.26 --> 01:18:25.94
truly

886
01:18:25.94 --> 01:18:33.54
Zero regret for your football career. You know what? I think I think what drew me to football was my dad's like

887
01:18:33.54 --> 01:18:39.06
He was so proud that because jay joined football first one year like when he was 10 when we were 10

888
01:18:39.62 --> 01:18:43.94
And my dad was so proud of him and I'd watch him playing how everyone just loved it and all this stuff

889
01:18:43.94 --> 01:18:47.22
So I was like, okay, and then the next year I went and we were good

890
01:18:47.30 --> 01:18:51.78
You know coming up or whatever. So it's like you just get the payoff of being good more so that I really liked football

891
01:18:51.78 --> 01:18:53.78
I think I did it for my dad to be honest

892
01:18:53.94 --> 01:18:56.58
Like not fully so you truly have no regret

893
01:18:57.70 --> 01:19:02.58
The football thing no, um, that's good. Yeah, that's good because there's some people that

894
01:19:02.58 --> 01:19:04.58
You know would have been

895
01:19:04.82 --> 01:19:09.38
invested and and from what you're saying you weren't actually that

896
01:19:10.66 --> 01:19:17.06
Had to you know, uh, let's say a 80 percent natural talent if a hundred gets you to the NFL you had 80 percent

897
01:19:17.30 --> 01:19:21.30
Yeah, you could have made it up to 87 because you would have if you would have worked really super hard

898
01:19:21.30 --> 01:19:25.30
But you still wouldn't have been yeah, so consider who went to the NFL from my team that I mean

899
01:19:25.30 --> 01:19:28.42
I'm there's some other guys kind of later on but Ashley Lele

900
01:19:28.66 --> 01:19:30.66
6 3 right of 4 2

901
01:19:30.66 --> 01:19:33.38
something 40 he went to the NFL

902
01:19:34.02 --> 01:19:38.82
My friend Jeff Ulbricht who I met he ran a 4 5. He weighs 255 he's 6 1

903
01:19:39.54 --> 01:19:45.06
Just a savage good at football. That's the thing too. Okay, and actually has all these touchdowns and like just good at football

904
01:19:45.86 --> 01:19:47.70
um, my friend Adrian Clam

905
01:19:47.70 --> 01:19:53.38
Who when he was lying man, he was 6 5 300 pounds and good at football long arms. He was all like

906
01:19:53.94 --> 01:19:58.66
Really, these are really these are elite athletes. Yeah in division one college football

907
01:19:58.66 --> 01:20:00.66
So you don't just go to the NFL

908
01:20:02.74 --> 01:20:06.90
Um, you had that realization was there anybody that surprised you?

909
01:20:08.26 --> 01:20:12.82
Anybody that like, you know little freddy. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there are there are the handful of those guys

910
01:20:13.14 --> 01:20:18.90
Um, they usually make it to like the combine stuff and the practice squad and they do some work there

911
01:20:18.90 --> 01:20:23.38
But they don't they don't go and play in the NFL, you know, um, no surprises

912
01:20:24.10 --> 01:20:26.66
Yeah, there was um, I totally forget his name

913
01:20:26.66 --> 01:20:32.58
Oh, man, I forget he went to the NFL guy went to the NFL played on some some squads didn't play in games or nothing

914
01:20:32.82 --> 01:20:36.42
But played on some score. There's a few guys if you just playing squad are you getting paid? Yeah, yeah

915
01:20:36.66 --> 01:20:41.78
Yeah, you can practice better than like a normal job for sure. Yeah better than your average job

916
01:20:42.02 --> 01:20:43.14
Oh, yeah

917
01:20:43.14 --> 01:20:46.90
Like you can get and that could that benefit of you could that oh, yeah

918
01:20:46.90 --> 01:20:51.54
Like if I would if I was gung-ho about football like these. Yeah, yeah, I think so

919
01:20:51.54 --> 01:20:56.42
All right, because I I read you assess that the game was not for you game was not for me

920
01:20:57.70 --> 01:21:00.58
The game I chose what I didn't have I didn't have a contingency

921
01:21:02.10 --> 01:21:06.66
I just I was I didn't have really like like goals. I was just trying to do whatever

922
01:21:06.90 --> 01:21:11.46
I'll be a personal trainer or something like this and then you know work in the clubs, you know when you're 20

923
01:21:12.34 --> 01:21:14.34
It's like whatever

924
01:21:15.94 --> 01:21:19.86
No, it was it was well into the club where I was like, hey, I got to do something like creative

925
01:21:19.86 --> 01:21:24.42
You know with with people that I like that are like that has a real future

926
01:21:24.50 --> 01:21:28.82
Not just the manager of a nightclub, you know, like that's not a I didn't see that as

927
01:21:29.70 --> 01:21:31.70
Who I was kind of a thing

928
01:21:32.02 --> 01:21:35.38
So I yeah, I joined with my brother and started your stuff

929
01:21:37.78 --> 01:21:39.78
Well

930
01:21:39.94 --> 01:21:44.90
I'm glad you were able to assess actually you taught me something passively. What's that?

931
01:21:44.90 --> 01:21:49.30
That you know how you're like a Navy SEAL or were whatever whatever

932
01:21:50.02 --> 01:21:55.38
Um, but then you're also a black belt in jujitsu and this is what I found out about you were like early on too where you like

933
01:21:56.18 --> 01:21:58.18
dabbled in like real estate

934
01:21:58.50 --> 01:22:04.66
And then I didn't find out you were this leadership dude or had that until Tim Ferriss podcast

935
01:22:04.74 --> 01:22:06.74
I literally didn't even know that

936
01:22:08.02 --> 01:22:10.42
Um, so the point there is you have like

937
01:22:10.42 --> 01:22:16.82
Five that's like what four or five different viable games to play five. Yeah, like very viable

938
01:22:17.46 --> 01:22:20.58
Just alone, but you have five of them going on at the same time

939
01:22:21.54 --> 01:22:25.70
Yes, and that is something that is a strategy

940
01:22:26.90 --> 01:22:31.38
And of and it the weird thing is and I'd say that this is probably

941
01:22:31.94 --> 01:22:35.06
You know, we talked about Fedor talent being able to put it all together

942
01:22:35.06 --> 01:22:40.10
I would say the little bit of talent that I have because that you know me. I'm not that talented in anything really

943
01:22:40.66 --> 01:22:42.90
But what I was pretty talented at was

944
01:22:43.62 --> 01:22:48.34
Being able to like work hard in a bunch of different things kind of simultaneously

945
01:22:48.34 --> 01:22:53.62
Yeah, kind of like I'm gonna do these things and they're all our time suckers

946
01:22:54.18 --> 01:22:59.30
And they all take a lot of effort and time, but I'm gonna go ahead and do them all at the same time

947
01:22:59.62 --> 01:23:01.62
And I think that's

948
01:23:01.62 --> 01:23:03.62
It's hard to do that

949
01:23:03.62 --> 01:23:09.22
Uh, and in some in a lot of cases it's not even smart to do that because in a lot of cases

950
01:23:09.94 --> 01:23:15.54
You know if you're doing one thing and then you're doing something else and you're doing something else and you're doing something else

951
01:23:15.78 --> 01:23:21.78
You're not prioritizing and executing. You're not focusing your resources properly to actually make anything happen

952
01:23:22.82 --> 01:23:24.82
So that

953
01:23:25.46 --> 01:23:28.50
In many cases is a negative to try and do

954
01:23:29.38 --> 01:23:31.38
A bunch of things at the same time

955
01:23:31.38 --> 01:23:33.86
You know, I would say like

956
01:23:34.90 --> 01:23:39.54
How much more dedicated I was I was very dedicated to jujitsu and I still

957
01:23:40.34 --> 01:23:42.34
train all the time, but

958
01:23:43.70 --> 01:23:46.66
And there was a time maybe where I was pretty good, but like

959
01:23:47.54 --> 01:23:52.10
Training when I'm training with Dean Lester and I'm training with Dean and he's like a world champion

960
01:23:53.38 --> 01:23:56.66
I recognize kind of like what you're saying. There was a gap

961
01:23:57.70 --> 01:23:59.70
In now

962
01:23:59.70 --> 01:24:03.54
In natural ability that would not be

963
01:24:04.58 --> 01:24:07.70
Would not be closed by any amount of work

964
01:24:08.10 --> 01:24:13.46
You know, there's a there's a certain level that he is and then I'd train with other world champions

965
01:24:13.46 --> 01:24:19.06
I'm like, okay. Yep. That person's better than me now. Look. I could have gotten close that gap more

966
01:24:19.86 --> 01:24:22.74
You know, if I'd have been like, all right, you know what? I'm just getting out of the navy

967
01:24:23.46 --> 01:24:28.50
And I'm gonna just do jujitsu all the time. Sure. I could close that gap more for sure 100% obviously

968
01:24:28.50 --> 01:24:32.34
Um, but yeah, I think that's that's me

969
01:24:33.54 --> 01:24:35.54
Working hard and not only that

970
01:24:36.42 --> 01:24:38.98
Uh, when it does come to prioritize and execute

971
01:24:40.02 --> 01:24:45.46
When I'm when I was doing one thing like I would do that thing. Yeah, and then two hours later

972
01:24:45.46 --> 01:24:48.98
I'm doing something else. I'm focused on that thing and then two hours later. I'm doing the other thing

973
01:24:49.06 --> 01:24:50.42
I'm doing it

974
01:24:50.42 --> 01:24:56.50
So I think the amount of focus that I would bring to the table when it came to pursuing goals was strong

975
01:24:56.50 --> 01:24:58.50
Yeah, and

976
01:24:58.66 --> 01:25:03.78
I never like I never sacrificed a one second of work

977
01:25:04.90 --> 01:25:06.90
In the SEAL teams for anything else

978
01:25:07.22 --> 01:25:11.30
For nothing else like there was no way that I was gonna ever

979
01:25:12.02 --> 01:25:14.74
Be like, oh, I gotta go. No, I never left work

980
01:25:15.54 --> 01:25:20.10
Never never never was like no I gotta go. That's why you know for many many years

981
01:25:20.82 --> 01:25:23.46
Dean and I trained at eight o'clock at night

982
01:25:23.46 --> 01:25:28.82
Um, because that's when I could safely know, you know, you get to work at six o'clock in the morning

983
01:25:28.90 --> 01:25:31.54
I know by eight o'clock I can get to the mats

984
01:25:32.26 --> 01:25:34.26
because I was never gonna

985
01:25:34.58 --> 01:25:36.58
prioritize anything

986
01:25:36.58 --> 01:25:37.70
above

987
01:25:37.70 --> 01:25:39.70
the primary job

988
01:25:39.86 --> 01:25:41.30
which is

989
01:25:41.30 --> 01:25:44.50
Being in a leadership role in the SEAL teams, which is going to trump all other

990
01:25:45.38 --> 01:25:46.90
things

991
01:25:46.90 --> 01:25:48.90
so you um

992
01:25:49.30 --> 01:25:51.30
some of it though and

993
01:25:51.30 --> 01:25:54.58
Yeah, maybe you're like, yeah, some of your stuff where you know,

994
01:25:55.22 --> 01:26:01.30
Especially now it's clear, but maybe maybe early on it wasn't but you know, like a lot of your stuff all the things that you're good at like

995
01:26:01.86 --> 01:26:03.86
certifiably good at

996
01:26:04.58 --> 01:26:06.58
You produce results in

997
01:26:06.58 --> 01:26:11.38
They like kind of can play off each other. True, you know, so like it's not like you're like, hey

998
01:26:11.38 --> 01:26:16.10
I'm gonna pursue being a rock star and then run echelon front is like they're too. They're so different

999
01:26:16.18 --> 01:26:18.90
I mean unless you're playing songs for them at the one the weekends or whatever, but

1000
01:26:18.90 --> 01:26:20.90
You they don't like which I don't

1001
01:26:23.38 --> 01:26:27.86
They don't play off each other as much, you know, but the the Venn diagram overlap

1002
01:26:28.50 --> 01:26:32.26
Of jujitsu of SEAL teams of leadership

1003
01:26:33.14 --> 01:26:38.26
And you know like either then you got like the real estate thing and that was always just a matter of me was like

1004
01:26:38.58 --> 01:26:42.26
There's a game going on here. Yeah, and as soon as I realized that oh

1005
01:26:43.94 --> 01:26:48.02
Hey, man, like I realized when I was pretty young. I'm paying someone else's mortgage

1006
01:26:48.02 --> 01:26:50.98
Yeah, when I'm paying rent, I'm paying someone else's mortgage

1007
01:26:51.78 --> 01:26:55.78
How do you win that game? The answer is you do not win that game. You do not win that game

1008
01:26:56.74 --> 01:26:57.94
You do not win that game

1009
01:26:57.94 --> 01:27:04.50
You have to get in a position where you're putting money and equity into your future not someone else's future

1010
01:27:05.06 --> 01:27:06.42
so

1011
01:27:06.42 --> 01:27:11.22
That's the kind of thing where it's like. Yes, that's a move I'm gonna make and I'm gonna sacrifice to be able to do it

1012
01:27:11.38 --> 01:27:13.38
I was house poor my entire navy career

1013
01:27:13.38 --> 01:27:19.46
I'm completely house poor driving a 1997 Dodge Grand Caravan for 13 years. That's a piece of shit car, man

1014
01:27:19.94 --> 01:27:22.74
That's like there's no that's that's an ego

1015
01:27:23.46 --> 01:27:26.10
You know, you see guys with their big trucks is the other end of the spectrum

1016
01:27:26.50 --> 01:27:33.54
Later, this is the deflator like hey, I'm rolling up in a 1997 the freaking window on the driver side didn't work

1017
01:27:34.18 --> 01:27:36.18
So it's taped up

1018
01:27:36.74 --> 01:27:42.34
But uh, that's what that's when I read when I realized that these games were in play

1019
01:27:42.34 --> 01:27:45.70
That's when I started to be able to play the game whether that game is like oh

1020
01:27:47.22 --> 01:27:53.54
Real estate paying someone else's paying rent is paying else someone else's mortgage. That's not a winning game

1021
01:27:54.02 --> 01:27:59.22
That's not how you win that game. Am I always gonna need a house? Kind of I'm always gonna need a place to live

1022
01:27:59.22 --> 01:28:00.66
I got a family

1023
01:28:00.66 --> 01:28:03.54
And believe me out there was times where I looked at all I can live in uh, you know

1024
01:28:03.54 --> 01:28:06.82
I was gonna do the boat live aboard thing a lot of people not a team guys do that

1025
01:28:06.82 --> 01:28:11.14
I'll just live aboard a boat whatever save that money cool, but again

1026
01:28:11.14 --> 01:28:18.10
You all you have to do is study that for 15 minutes and you realize that a boat is a depreciating asset

1027
01:28:18.42 --> 01:28:21.86
It doesn't get it loses value over time all of them

1028
01:28:22.66 --> 01:28:27.06
Like okay, you can get a car. That's a that's a classic or whatever. That's very rare

1029
01:28:28.10 --> 01:28:34.10
Cars boats planes. They're all depreciating assets. So when I realized that it's like, well, I'll move on a boat

1030
01:28:34.18 --> 01:28:39.30
Okay, that's a depreciating asset. I know over time I'm gonna end up in a worse spot the only way to do this is I gotta buy a house

1031
01:28:39.30 --> 01:28:42.02
Okay, then once I bought a house it was like, okay

1032
01:28:42.10 --> 01:28:44.50
well, how long do I need to hold on to this house before I can buy another one

1033
01:28:44.90 --> 01:28:47.46
how long for another one how long for another one and

1034
01:28:48.74 --> 01:28:54.18
Again when you look at all these different things that are happening you can start to say, oh

1035
01:28:54.82 --> 01:28:56.82
I can at least see

1036
01:28:57.06 --> 01:28:59.94
The game that's being played and I can get in the game

1037
01:29:02.74 --> 01:29:04.74
That's my recommendation

1038
01:29:04.74 --> 01:29:09.22
Oh with that we will continue this thread. We'll see

1039
01:29:10.18 --> 01:29:11.46
Um, oh

1040
01:29:11.46 --> 01:29:15.70
Perhaps on the next podcast. I don't know. We'll review this one and see if there's a little bit more to add to it

1041
01:29:15.78 --> 01:29:20.34
If anyone has questions about this one hit us up. Yeah, this one's helpful, man

1042
01:29:20.50 --> 01:29:25.22
For even for me just listening, man, it's so helpful. Well, that's what I realized with these

1043
01:29:26.10 --> 01:29:31.46
past couple podcasts if I've got friends that I communicate with regularly and they don't realize this stuff

1044
01:29:31.54 --> 01:29:33.94
I know there's a lot of people that I haven't done a good job of

1045
01:29:33.94 --> 01:29:36.66
job of communicating this too.

1046
01:29:36.66 --> 01:29:41.66
I know that, look, I cover a lot of military stuff,

1047
01:29:43.84 --> 01:29:45.34
cover a lot of leadership stuff,

1048
01:29:45.34 --> 01:29:48.36
but it's interesting when I talk about military

1049
01:29:48.36 --> 01:29:51.48
and leadership things, I always think that

1050
01:29:51.48 --> 01:29:53.78
the correlations to life are so obvious,

1051
01:29:53.78 --> 01:29:55.82
but they're not as obvious as you think they are.

1052
01:29:55.82 --> 01:29:57.94
Not as obvious as I think they are.

1053
01:29:57.94 --> 01:30:02.94
So this is one of those where hopefully people can see

1054
01:30:03.98 --> 01:30:06.66
through pretty direct communication

1055
01:30:06.66 --> 01:30:10.02
the concepts that we're talking about,

1056
01:30:10.02 --> 01:30:15.02
and everyone is susceptible to the problems

1057
01:30:15.72 --> 01:30:20.10
that can occur if you don't know about the game.

1058
01:30:20.10 --> 01:30:25.10
So speaking of that, we got Choco Fuel,

1059
01:30:28.42 --> 01:30:31.18
we both have been drinking a lot.

1060
01:30:31.18 --> 01:30:32.66
You drink a milk during this?

1061
01:30:32.66 --> 01:30:33.50
Yes.

1062
01:30:33.50 --> 01:30:34.34
How was it?

1063
01:30:34.34 --> 01:30:36.38
Good, I'm signing banana cream all day.

1064
01:30:36.38 --> 01:30:38.38
Not as obvious as my normal chocolate,

1065
01:30:38.38 --> 01:30:41.26
but bro, I seriously drink two of those a day.

1066
01:30:41.26 --> 01:30:44.94
Cause I got the freaking stockpile at home.

1067
01:30:44.94 --> 01:30:46.62
Yeah, so get yourself some protein.

1068
01:30:46.62 --> 01:30:47.54
It's really easy.

1069
01:30:47.54 --> 01:30:50.18
You know, you first alerted me to the fact

1070
01:30:50.18 --> 01:30:53.70
that if you're trying to get the amount of protein

1071
01:30:53.70 --> 01:30:58.70
that you need, 30 grams of protein is a legitimate nudge.

1072
01:31:00.58 --> 01:31:02.78
It's a legitimate, like, oh, this is a,

1073
01:31:02.78 --> 01:31:05.94
this is a legitimate boost to the protein intake.

1074
01:31:05.94 --> 01:31:08.06
I think that's more than a normal,

1075
01:31:08.06 --> 01:31:10.46
like what do you call it, like your FD,

1076
01:31:10.46 --> 01:31:11.78
I mean like a normal meal,

1077
01:31:11.78 --> 01:31:14.58
like a normal one serving meal or whatever,

1078
01:31:14.58 --> 01:31:16.66
30 grams is more than an normal meal.

1079
01:31:16.66 --> 01:31:17.66
There you go.

1080
01:31:17.66 --> 01:31:22.06
So Moque, we got these beautiful drinks.

1081
01:31:22.06 --> 01:31:23.34
We didn't call them energy drinks.

1082
01:31:23.34 --> 01:31:25.46
I mean, they are called energy drinks, technically speaking,

1083
01:31:25.46 --> 01:31:27.94
but they're not because energy drinks are bad for you.

1084
01:31:27.94 --> 01:31:29.58
And this one's good for you.

1085
01:31:29.58 --> 01:31:31.62
So we're in a totally different level.

1086
01:31:31.62 --> 01:31:33.18
We're not in the game that they're in.

1087
01:31:33.18 --> 01:31:35.02
They're in the game of poisoning you.

1088
01:31:35.02 --> 01:31:36.98
We're in the game of making you better,

1089
01:31:36.98 --> 01:31:40.66
smarter, faster, stronger, jocofuel.com.

1090
01:31:40.66 --> 01:31:41.50
Get some of that.

1091
01:31:41.50 --> 01:31:42.94
You can get it at Wawa.

1092
01:31:42.94 --> 01:31:45.46
You can get it at Vitamin Shop, the military commissaries.

1093
01:31:45.46 --> 01:31:47.90
Look, if you're, I got word the other day

1094
01:31:49.22 --> 01:31:52.58
that there was a military commissary that was lacking.

1095
01:31:52.58 --> 01:31:57.58
So, hey, also check in the health and wellness section

1096
01:31:58.54 --> 01:31:59.38
of stores.

1097
01:31:59.38 --> 01:32:01.18
Sometimes you're looking at the energy drinks section.

1098
01:32:01.18 --> 01:32:02.26
Some stores put them in there.

1099
01:32:02.26 --> 01:32:05.46
Sometimes they put them over in the health and wellness.

1100
01:32:05.46 --> 01:32:07.06
So check that out.

1101
01:32:07.06 --> 01:32:09.30
Military commissaries, Hannaford,

1102
01:32:09.30 --> 01:32:11.94
Dash Stores in Maryland, Wakefern in Shoprite,

1103
01:32:11.94 --> 01:32:13.82
Circle K in Florida, H-E-B.

1104
01:32:13.82 --> 01:32:16.06
Shout out to all my people in Texas

1105
01:32:16.06 --> 01:32:18.54
that are rolling into H-E-B and clearing shelves.

1106
01:32:18.54 --> 01:32:19.82
Freaking outstanding, thank you.

1107
01:32:19.82 --> 01:32:23.26
Murphy's, Meyer, up in the Midwest.

1108
01:32:23.26 --> 01:32:25.14
So there you go, jocofuel.

1109
01:32:25.14 --> 01:32:25.98
Get some.

1110
01:32:25.98 --> 01:32:27.30
Get some.

1111
01:32:27.30 --> 01:32:29.42
Here's what we like to say around here.

1112
01:32:29.42 --> 01:32:30.26
Yup, it's true.

1113
01:32:30.26 --> 01:32:34.22
Also, origin USA, American made apparel.

1114
01:32:34.22 --> 01:32:35.50
We're gonna start with jujitsu stuff.

1115
01:32:35.50 --> 01:32:37.62
Giz, when you're doing jujitsu, you need a good Giz.

1116
01:32:37.62 --> 01:32:39.62
So why not get the best Giz?

1117
01:32:39.62 --> 01:32:40.46
And plenty of options.

1118
01:32:40.46 --> 01:32:41.38
So don't even worry about like,

1119
01:32:41.38 --> 01:32:42.30
oh, I gotta get the one.

1120
01:32:42.30 --> 01:32:43.14
No, you can get one too.

1121
01:32:43.14 --> 01:32:45.10
No, you can get whichever one you want.

1122
01:32:45.10 --> 01:32:47.94
Why would you run out and buy a Model T Ford

1123
01:32:47.94 --> 01:32:49.46
that was rusty when you could go out

1124
01:32:49.46 --> 01:32:52.02
and legitimately buy a Cadillac?

1125
01:32:52.02 --> 01:32:54.18
Because that's the difference between a normal G

1126
01:32:54.18 --> 01:32:55.02
and an origin G.

1127
01:32:55.02 --> 01:32:56.06
It's like that.

1128
01:32:56.06 --> 01:32:58.18
And that's not even to mention where it's made,

1129
01:32:58.18 --> 01:32:59.02
see what I'm saying?

1130
01:32:59.02 --> 01:33:00.30
Which is a whole other thing, huge.

1131
01:33:00.30 --> 01:33:01.58
Actually, probably even hugeer

1132
01:33:01.58 --> 01:33:04.74
when you really think about the big game, if you will.

1133
01:33:04.74 --> 01:33:05.58
See what I'm saying?

1134
01:33:05.58 --> 01:33:07.54
But yes, best of both worlds.

1135
01:33:07.54 --> 01:33:09.66
Giz, Rashgards, got some short, some hoodies.

1136
01:33:09.66 --> 01:33:11.22
Okay, so I have four, well actually I have

1137
01:33:11.22 --> 01:33:13.38
like eight origin hoodies.

1138
01:33:13.38 --> 01:33:15.74
100% the past month and a half,

1139
01:33:15.74 --> 01:33:18.42
100% every single day, even weekends,

1140
01:33:18.42 --> 01:33:20.02
I wear the hoodies, one of the hoodies.

1141
01:33:20.02 --> 01:33:21.82
It's a little chilly out here in California

1142
01:33:21.82 --> 01:33:23.74
for the Californians, especially for the Hawaiians

1143
01:33:23.74 --> 01:33:25.78
be thinking it's for you or no, the heavy hoodie.

1144
01:33:25.78 --> 01:33:28.94
Well, you and I were doing some filming today.

1145
01:33:28.94 --> 01:33:31.98
And I had like, I wear my origin hoodie every day

1146
01:33:31.98 --> 01:33:33.50
and it just covered in food.

1147
01:33:33.50 --> 01:33:37.50
I was like, dude, I gotta give me a second, you know?

1148
01:33:37.50 --> 01:33:39.94
I got like scraps of steak on here.

1149
01:33:39.94 --> 01:33:41.74
There's meatball on there.

1150
01:33:41.74 --> 01:33:43.18
I just had to clean that thing off

1151
01:33:43.18 --> 01:33:45.98
because I guess I'm not one of those people

1152
01:33:45.98 --> 01:33:49.94
that's super into like, you know, whatever, fashion.

1153
01:33:49.94 --> 01:33:51.46
Amen, you look great.

1154
01:33:51.46 --> 01:33:55.34
We get the Hunt gear too, got the jeans, Delta jeans,

1155
01:33:55.34 --> 01:33:57.26
Delta 68s, come on.

1156
01:33:57.26 --> 01:33:59.70
Multiple levels of wash too.

1157
01:33:59.70 --> 01:34:01.06
Oh yeah, that's right.

1158
01:34:01.06 --> 01:34:02.82
That's right, we got a wash house.

1159
01:34:02.82 --> 01:34:03.66
Yep.

1160
01:34:03.66 --> 01:34:04.50
That's a thing.

1161
01:34:04.50 --> 01:34:05.34
OriginUSA.com.

1162
01:34:05.34 --> 01:34:07.06
Do you know the dynamics between the,

1163
01:34:07.06 --> 01:34:08.50
like do you know under what circumstances

1164
01:34:08.50 --> 01:34:11.46
is you wear the dark, the medium and the light?

1165
01:34:11.46 --> 01:34:12.54
Under what circumstances?

1166
01:34:12.54 --> 01:34:14.26
Yeah, like, you know, when you wear light jeans,

1167
01:34:14.26 --> 01:34:16.74
that's like a daytime spring.

1168
01:34:16.74 --> 01:34:19.54
It's more casual, dark jeans, more like dressy.

1169
01:34:19.54 --> 01:34:20.38
See what I'm saying?

1170
01:34:20.38 --> 01:34:21.58
And then it's a spectrum.

1171
01:34:21.58 --> 01:34:22.90
Bro, you gotta know that kind of stuff.

1172
01:34:22.90 --> 01:34:25.10
When you're in big eight, you're going out on dates.

1173
01:34:25.10 --> 01:34:26.30
Just saying, I'm here to help.

1174
01:34:26.30 --> 01:34:27.54
You gotta know the game you're playing.

1175
01:34:27.54 --> 01:34:31.42
Also, Jocko has a store, it's called Jocko Store.

1176
01:34:31.42 --> 01:34:32.54
That's where you can represent

1177
01:34:32.54 --> 01:34:36.02
with discipline equals freedom, deathcore to the core

1178
01:34:37.22 --> 01:34:38.02
on this path.

1179
01:34:38.02 --> 01:34:38.86
I've seen the shirt locker.

1180
01:34:38.86 --> 01:34:39.70
While we're playing this game.

1181
01:34:39.70 --> 01:34:40.82
I've seen the last shirt locker.

1182
01:34:40.82 --> 01:34:43.46
Shirt, no free dopamine.

1183
01:34:43.46 --> 01:34:45.58
Just throwing that out there as a flag.

1184
01:34:45.58 --> 01:34:48.58
Like, hey, I'm here, no free dopamine.

1185
01:34:48.58 --> 01:34:50.74
If you're wearing that shirt

1186
01:34:51.66 --> 01:34:53.42
and you're looking at Instagram

1187
01:34:54.58 --> 01:34:58.58
and you're scrolling and it's giving you free dopamine,

1188
01:34:58.58 --> 01:34:59.70
dopamine, dopamine, dopamine.

1189
01:34:59.70 --> 01:35:01.50
Nope, by lading the whole thing again.

1190
01:35:01.50 --> 01:35:03.38
Feel that it happened, come on.

1191
01:35:03.38 --> 01:35:04.22
It's true.

1192
01:35:04.22 --> 01:35:06.50
Clear your brain, clear your brain.

1193
01:35:06.50 --> 01:35:07.82
Shirt locker, that's what you're talking about.

1194

He's just getting after it.

Just getting after it, no matter what.

01:35:31.30 --> 01:35:34.74
Dakota Meyer, he's got his own gym down there in Texas.

1206

and I was like, oh, Dakota Meyer represent.

1212

you wanna help their families, Gold Star families,

1257
01:37:16.34 --> 01:37:18.38
check out Mark Lee's mom, Momily.

1258
01:37:18.38 --> 01:37:19.94
She's got a charity organization.

1259
01:37:19.94 --> 01:37:21.46
You heard her on the podcast.

1260
01:37:21.46 --> 01:37:22.90
You heard about her son.

1261
01:37:22.90 --> 01:37:24.66
If you wanna donate, you wanna get involved.

1262
01:37:24.66 --> 01:37:27.70
Go to americasmightywarriors.org.

1263
01:37:27.70 --> 01:37:29.26
And also don't forget about Micah Fink,

1264
01:37:29.26 --> 01:37:34.26
who at present time is up there in the wilderness somewhere.

1265
01:37:34.26 --> 01:37:38.98
He's got a small mountain lion in one hand

1266
01:37:38.98 --> 01:37:40.90
and he's got a bow and arrow in the other hand

1267
01:37:40.90 --> 01:37:43.46
and he's in the pursuit of a grizzly bear.

1268
01:37:43.46 --> 01:37:45.02
That's what he's doing right now.

1269
01:37:45.02 --> 01:37:48.54
So go to heroesandhorses.org

1270
01:37:48.54 --> 01:37:51.70
if you wanna help him help our veterans.

1271
01:37:51.70 --> 01:37:54.02
And also, if you wanna connect with us,

1272
01:37:54.02 --> 01:37:55.42
we're on the interwebs.

1273
01:37:55.42 --> 01:37:56.66
Echo Charles is on Twitter.

1274
01:37:56.66 --> 01:37:58.86
He's back on Twitter.

1275
01:37:58.86 --> 01:38:00.66
Mistakes were made.

1276
01:38:00.66 --> 01:38:02.22
They've been amended.

1277
01:38:02.22 --> 01:38:06.42
Growth is re-responding his life on Twitter.

1278
01:38:07.54 --> 01:38:09.02
So check him out.

1279
01:38:09.02 --> 01:38:10.58
He's at Echo Charles.

1280
01:38:10.58 --> 01:38:11.70
He's on the gram.

1281
01:38:12.62 --> 01:38:13.70
He's on the Facebook.

1282
01:38:13.70 --> 01:38:14.54
He's on the Facebook.

1283
01:38:15.54 --> 01:38:17.30
At Echo Charles, I'm at Jocko-Wong.

1284
01:38:17.30 --> 01:38:18.54
Listen, if you're gonna go on there though,

1285
01:38:18.54 --> 01:38:20.14
just be careful,

1286
01:38:20.14 --> 01:38:22.30
because there's free dopamine on there.

1287
01:38:22.30 --> 01:38:24.18
They might as well be giving you cocaine

1288
01:38:24.18 --> 01:38:25.66
or methamphetamines.

1289
01:38:25.66 --> 01:38:28.62
And it's getting better too, by the way.

1290
01:38:28.62 --> 01:38:29.62
Just let me throw that out.

1291
01:38:29.62 --> 01:38:30.66
You mean they're getting better

1292
01:38:30.66 --> 01:38:31.66
at manipulating your brain?

1293
01:38:31.66 --> 01:38:32.98
With the algorithm, yes.

1294
01:38:32.98 --> 01:38:34.94
The algorithm is just honed.

1295
01:38:34.94 --> 01:38:36.06
Honed, yeah.

1296
01:38:36.06 --> 01:38:40.50
Like if you are into jujitsu,

1297
01:38:40.50 --> 01:38:42.90
but you're really into umapatas,

1298
01:38:42.90 --> 01:38:45.34
it's like showing you more umapatas.

1299
01:38:45.34 --> 01:38:47.26
If you're really into surfing,

1300
01:38:47.26 --> 01:38:52.26
but you're really like single-fin 70s guns,

1301
01:38:52.38 --> 01:38:53.22
sure.

1302
01:38:53.22 --> 01:38:54.06
Which I do.

1303
01:38:54.06 --> 01:38:54.90
Hell yeah.

1304
01:38:54.90 --> 01:38:56.98
What just miraculously pops up.

1305
01:38:56.98 --> 01:38:58.34
So they're tracking on you.

1306
01:38:58.34 --> 01:39:00.22
That's the algorithm.

1307
01:39:00.22 --> 01:39:01.06
Watch out.

1308
01:39:02.10 --> 01:39:04.46
And thanks to our members of the Army, Navy,

1309
01:39:04.46 --> 01:39:05.46
Air Force Marines,

1310
01:39:05.46 --> 01:39:07.14
who are playing the ultimate game

1311
01:39:07.14 --> 01:39:09.78
around the world preserving freedom.

1312
01:39:09.78 --> 01:39:10.78
Thank you for your service.

1313
01:39:10.78 --> 01:39:13.38
And thanks also to our police and law enforcement,

1314
01:39:13.38 --> 01:39:16.50
firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

1315
01:39:16.50 --> 01:39:17.42
correctional officers,

1316
01:39:17.42 --> 01:39:18.86
Border Patrol Secret Service,

1317
01:39:18.86 --> 01:39:20.66
and all first responders.

1318
01:39:20.66 --> 01:39:23.82
Thank you for preserving our way of life here at home.

1319
01:39:23.82 --> 01:39:26.10
And to everyone else out there,

1320
01:39:27.78 --> 01:39:29.42
don't lie to yourself.

1321
01:39:31.38 --> 01:39:33.06
And until next time,

1322
01:39:33.06 --> 01:39:35.38
this is Echo and Jaco.

1323
01:39:35.38 --> 01:39:54.22
Now.
