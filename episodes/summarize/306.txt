He may well strive to reduce dissidents by telling himself and others that the correlation between smoking and cancer could Just as well be taken to signify that people who are going to get cancer anyway tend to smoke in order to ward off the disease So you're just telling yourself lies to try to try and even out that disagreement in your own head Since it was first Propounded by a festinger in 1957 dissonance theory has given rise to a large number of empirical studies Through the though the precise nature of the underlying psychological processes as far from clear There are certain conclusions which could have serious implications for military decision making They may be summarized by saying that quote once the decision has been made and the person is committed to a given course of action The psychological situation changes decisively There is less emphasis on objectivity and there is more partiality and bias in the way in which the person views and evaluates the alternatives and quote in other words decision making may well be followed by a period of mental activity that could be described as at the very least Some what one cited Yeah, dude you I would he like I got halfway into that sentence and you were just shaking your head because you know you seen this happen totally and he you know He you did that list earlier and I the one that was Coming back to as you're talking about in the hard part about as you can you can I know what you're gonna say before He's saying and now you know what's coming when he's describing this is here's the plan Jocco's down in the front sends me a report. This is where we start to get a little psychological reference there that we have things in our subconscious that make us a certain way and one of the things he's saying is people that people that like things to be super orderly, super or orderly they don't like change, they don't like when bad things happen, they don't like when things that you can't control, they don't like those things. Maybe some people are not, you know, 0.01 but you got a spectrum and the case here is that if you look at the military and you see people that are all uniform and you see that everything's clean you look at that as a type of environment I might want to go into because I'm kind of like that and that's how you end up with people in this zone for what you guys wrote it down as like this guy is such a good idea. He says You know If Ellie how do we want proves one thing like you're you're you're pretty tough You know because he sees these guys after six days of freaking you know being awake and doing physical stuff You guys you have proofs one thing you're pretty tough and I actually said back to him I said you know there's a group of people that also Go go through hell week and make it through how weak and what it proves is that they figured out how to how to get through Because there's things you can do in hell week This was an assessment started as skipped it, but this was an assessment that got done of how they were training the Military the army officers and then it says much the same picture has been painted of Britannia four under of the Royal Naval College of Dartmouth Dartmouth again the emphasis was on blind obedience Sport and ceremonial with scant regard to intellectual pursuits and little pride in knowing one's job You know it's funny as soon as you say something like there's too much drill as soon as you say You know if you're maybe you're thinking hey man We're spending a lot of time just doing this like stupid drill stuff There's someone that's like You know, it's like I think I know who those guys are Yeah, and really Anything anything there's no there I'm trying to think of a job Where the full Where where the the primary thing is only intelligence only intelligence I'm sure there's some laboratory somewhere or some computer programming thing where Basically the smartest person is the person that we want that job But as soon as that person is in charge of people anyone else or in soon as there's some level of creativity or problem solving because there's You just you what you want is a person that's composite has a bunch of different skills. This is the important part Because with any situation that you have there's gonna be different sides to every argument There's gonna be different sides to be if we're gonna go to a taqatarget Part of your brain should be saying like okay, this looks like something we can get done part of it to say Okay, there's looks like there's a rata risks as well you got two different things in your head two different In congruent thoughts in your head they they're not the same and you know the different services and aviation have different sets of requirements and you know I think The Marine Corps has the the lowest I guess standard of academic excellence in terms like what you studied in how well you did I mean the old joke in the Marine Corps was you know if you got a 2.0 and underwater basket We even you could be a pilot you know as the joke and you know what they were saying really was But there's something a little different about the ones that make it up to that level and How it isn't quite just the same bell curve of everybody else where you got some smart people some you know middle-the-road folks Maybe some other folks and what I've been trying to Think in my mind about what that is is is kind of what you described is what's unique about those people those people Have figured out how to navigate the system this thing that we're all living in because when you join the military I don't count smart you are dumb But you wouldn't want to put them into a situation where they've got to stand up and talk from people if they don't have that skill So just because someone is smart that's only like one quarter of the of the of the of the math we got to do here totally and when you're thinking about it from a leadership standpoint and The recognition that that leadership requires a whole bunch of different things not just being You know smart and taking a test or being good at communicating it's the recognition that it requires so many different things None of these these profiles that he just revealed are a big shock to me Well, I got one shot up right wouldn't shot up Wait, what is pontificate talking talking carrying on talking especially things that you don't really know too much about It's also not a compliment like if somebody like what's like we're gonna the jacco But you know people might get the impression that oh, you know Jocco it's like at the master when I'm guess what I'm on stage I'm talking that's what we're doing Come to an echelon front meeting You know see who he's talking like see how much I'm talking It well a catch phrase or to be like we've we always done it this way or We need to stick with the plan right those are just catch phrases and that's what I'm gonna say or I just say We know Dave's always got his own freaking Dave's always on his own freaking program like I can I can ridicule you or I can just get mad That's what we sit So he's already building off of taller platform But also Cass Baroff said I think Cass Baroff was like 55 60 something like this Maybe let me know a little bit over he's like yeah, well, I'm older I mean you would think for being a pilot Uh There's gotta be you know that that like the spatial like when I took the officer candid Test and you've got to do the spatial recognition where how far away is this or is this aircraft or is this bird coming to you or going away from you? No that you know blowing things up sounds cool Being an intellectual doesn and if I can figure out early on What is it gonna appeal to you whoever my bosses are that school is or the intent is or the system and that's a Request of this is about the bellkers different of the top because they figured out how to navigate the system What the system wants and what the system wants is whoever's in charge that thing that appeals to them Which is things like What would you rather have someone who? and I say something like you know You know Here comes the new guy with a bread idea You know like to just kind of push you off Maybe that's our problem Another contribution to the incompetence tied up with age was the unhelpful tendency to Sack Fortunately retire or otherwise curtail the promotion of those young officers who unwisely failed to conceal their their lights But-neath bushels of conformity So real quick on the getting old part this is something that I was I think I talked about it on on the academy I heard that interview with Cass Baroff the chess player and Interview or acts actually I think it was Lex Friedman Lex asked him maybe it was Lex I think Lex asked him Not in a direct way, but basically could you beat Magnus Carlson who's right now like this phenom and And Cass Baroff said no and of the part of the answer which is what I talked about on the academy was part of their reason is because Magnus has got to see everything that Cost bar off done and study him. It's simple The subtitle that is simple clear concise communication So pontification is the opposite of that oddly enough Unfortunately such a predisposition it will be the strong the will be strongest in those like head masters judges Prison governors and senior military commanders who for too long have been in a position to lord over their fellow men Unfortunately such a predisposition will also be strongest in authoritarian organizations Where the preservation of apparent omnitions by those above Maybe deemed more important than the truth So this is that senior leader that Basically no one will tell them to be quiet and you know what's even worse than that People sit there with a big smile in their face nodding their heads cuz you know Yeah, I think it's the same I really do I don't think I don't think the personality profile You know or even just the motivational profile of A lot of people in the military is all that different certainly when I think about seals and pilots and as often as you and I kind of contrast those two types of people There's a ton of similarity there And that's what this number is number six an obstinate persistence in a given task Despite strong contrary evidence that was number six number seven of failure to exploit a Situation gained an attendancy to quote poll punches Rather than push home an attack Number eight of failure to make adequate reconnaissance Number nine a predilection for frontal assaults often against the enemies strongest point And again Even what's again at the master I'm Trying to explain to people because you know there's people that want that they would they just want to hear you say look So someone's called some problems. But you know, it's just a bad situation so these are the best things that could happen As response to that is no one would deny there's more to grain of truth and all these propositions cool Facts do get distorted and then the telling disasters are indeed more newsworthy than successes Riders undoubtedly do enjoy painting the worst possible picture of their particular Bet noires many Generals have had to contend with an up-to-toed Unformed interference and the stingingists of their political masters and of course things could have been worse There are counter arguments however because they are Surrogate father figures people are only too ready and anxious to love their adnelson generals particular a time of war We see that a lot right the if someone was in the military Then they must be awesome and And recent years that's gotten I would say even more prolific if someone's that then anything they say has some merit and value Okay, I always thought it was like kind of thinking and talking but in a good way I thought it was like hey, let's get to the bottom of let's listen explore it, you know, but No matter what's going on in your company, you think you got issues, you think you got problems, things are going wrong, things are going sideways. Yes, and although You can smell intent the system has a much harder time smelling intent A system has a much harder time smelling intent look they look at Dave Burke and they look at Jaco and they both went overseas Took a hard fill billet Jaco was doing it because he wanted to get promoted Dave was doing it because he had You know his kids had just left for for a college and so he felt like it was a good time What was the thing with like the bottom the atomic bomb like the technology was like Made for something or the or the idea was like the technology was made for something Gotta tell from looking at it Hey, obviously Someone could be really really smart and suck at that test right not to mention eyesight not to mention Reaction time like all those different things and then same thing with leadership You can have someone that's super articulate that's there's there's really articulate people that aren't really that smart It's, you know, the term self doubt doesn't have like this positive connotation, but it's like, oh, hey, I bet you're this bunch of things I don't know. Yeah, who's gonna weapon like someone's gonna weaponize it in it's like that's the fear like you put you and me in a room I'm gonna consider that I might be wrong and I'm gonna Moose slowly in this direction until we come to a the logical conclusion or I'm just gonna attack this target and run it over And the ones that figure out the system and have a navigate that it makes sense That at the top They actually use a different bell curve of people than those of us at the beginning who actually some of us Don't figure out how to navigate that system. But there's another group of people that's a group of people you're talking about that They don't have the capability but they figure out you know at Adam McGuire We were talking one day and he said He said you know if we I think he had gone over to see some The seals secure or the bud students secure from hell week and he came back. The second one is bad planning and in the third one is the third and most Cossely type of man power wastage is that resulting from a deliberate policy of attrition adopted by Commanders who regarded soldiers as wholly expendable Generals for whom the conservation of human life rank lower than in importance than in various other criteria which were governing their actions This is when your plan is oh a lot of people are gonna die Fast for a little basis in all this we are anticipating a theory of military incompetence rather different from that held by Proponents of the so called bloody fool theory Perhaps we are being too complicated perhaps intellectual deficit could explain the data less than before Considering the other factors contributing to military incompetence first examine this older and more favored hypothesis and so what are you saying here? right here when I read this I was like oh man this is good You look back at your career and to think of all these people that like to pontificate And if I out rank you like the military this whole military experiment then I automatically win I automatically win because I'll just shut you up because I'm now mad and I'm just gonna resort to what I got as hey Why don't you just go back to your desk and let me let me let me let me let me Lead for a little while here since I'm in charge. So so you are getting some dumb people here Fast forward a little certainly a brilliant performance in military schools is no guarantee of subsequent ability General colleague who's the session of defeats culminated in 1881 in his own demise at Mujaba Hill Had the distinction of passing out of snath college with the highest marks on record The irrelevance of early scholarship to subsequent general ship also find support in Napoleon and Wellington both of whom achieved very low grades at school And in more recent times the early academic brilliance of lieutenant general Perseval evidently availed him little at Singapore so he's given all these other examples right you got Perseval who led that total disaster in Singapore Who was Academically brilliant Napoleon and Wellington who were great generals who were junk at school and another guy General colleague who is a disaster on the battlefield and yet had the highest marks on record So I got Advanced early one time which is which was like I only know of one other person I don't know one person that got promoted early twice. So that's one conclusion a second conclusion might be what seems to have been military incompetence was really due to other non-military factors Such as governmental stingingists They grieve of the weather and sheer bad luck a Third conclusion might be that since every military action is an uncontrolled experiment in the sense that it can never be known what would Have been the outcome had been this had decisions been different there remains an almost unimaginable possibility that Things might have been worse that what was done did represent the least disasterous of possible courses open So There are some different reasons why you could say well, you know, it's not really military incompetence. We're just gonna keep doing this or like hey listen it's got much worse and Rationalization all those words, but the the willingness to just ignore the truth because it is inconvenient with the conclusion I've already drawn and how quick let I can go You know what his feedback is you know Fortunately, there are some who have seen the threat to originality and intelligent thinking The Duke of Edinburgh felt it necessary to say finally as you grow older try not to be afraid of new ideas new original ideas Can be bad as well as good but whereas an intelligent man with an open mind can demolish a bad idea by reasoned argument Those who allow their brains to Attrophy report resort to meaningless catchphrases to Duration and finally to anger in the face of anything new This is you know this is Prince Philip Duke of Edinburgh recently died I don't know if you saw this funeral, but if you have any Any Warm place in your heart for the brits which I certainly do They is his hurts was a land rover a military land rover that he had had some hand in design he was some sort of Special transport and that's what they that's what they care of his body What he just mentioned, the ability to tolerate uncertainty, spontaneity of thought and action, having an open mind, open to new ideas, even threatening ideas, having an open mind to threatening ideas, you have many discussions I've had where I won in the initial conversation in the first four sentences because when Dave came to me and said, I think we should do this a different way and I said, oh, sounds like you fought this through, what do you want to do? But it's not the top priority you got to take care of your people Continuing on here excessive loss of life and high casualty figures would therefore seem like a likely indicator of military incompetence Noon cases of what seemed to be purely administrative incompetence as for example in what John Laffin has described as the imbacill Waltern expedition of 1809 though the purpose of this expedition was to attack Antwerp the troops were in fact Captain waiting for eight weeks on unhealthy Watcher in island in Zeeland in the event and owing to the procrastination of the military commander Lord Chatham and the naval commander serritchered straight in 7,000 men died 14,000 had their health permanently ruined and thousands more became ill mostly from malaria Only 217 were killed in action and I'm like he likes to pontificate a lot That's not it that's not me saying he's a big thinker He's me like they do like to hear himself talk he weighs a lot of time thinking out loud What grounds are there then for the most popular explanation of military incompetence stupidity There's there's a suggestion that the arms force armed forces do not attract the best brains A call-up serving the survey in the United States put the status of army officers below that of professors Physicians clergymen and school teachers As Morris Genowitz remarks a liberal ideology hold that since war is essentially destructive the best minds are attracted to more positive endeavors Um, that's like one of those statements you got well, you know if you're making that statement You would if you're a really smart person. It doesn't matter you check it you're good Notwithstanding these considerations ages far from being a complete explanation of military incompetence for There have been plenty of old generals and some remarkably inept young ones Or sorry there's been plenty of able old generals and some remarkably inept young ones So he's saying look even though old people might have a hard time there's been freaking incredible generals that were super old and there's been young generals that were idiots So that argument doesn't really hold as it backs noted the generals of AD Generals who were sick of body and even in mind have one important victories. but they don't get close enough on the promotion board Some people around you know Fast forward a little bit general Robert E. Lee admitted that the greatest mistake of my life was taking a military education And general still well said it is common knowledge that an army officer has a one track mind that he is personally interested in stirring up wars So that he can get a promotion and be decorated and that he has an extraordinarily limited education with no appreciation of the finer things in life That's a heavy statement again. I mean look so in the seal teams for a while they were recruiting these really really smart Ivy league you know Harvard Yale there's all this whole crew of officers that were coming in They were clearly highly intellectual smart people and They stopped recruiting those people so heavily and the reason they stopped recruiting those people so heavily was two reasons And he you know At he Got me because of that thing right there He listened to me and this guy ended up uh we ended up working together a lot and actually Just an awesome guy but anyways He used that thing He said it up That little that little surprise number one. And if you want to help service members active and retired service members, if you want to help the families, if you want to help gold star families, you can check out Mark Lee's mom, Mamla Lee, she's got a charity organization and if you want to donate or you want to get involved, go to americazmightyoriors.org and if you want more of my P-brained pontifications, or you need more of Ecos ridiculous ramblings or Dave's enthusiastic extras. and then I said aim these things to yourself When you hear stuff like this when I hear stuff like this I aim it at myself Don't be afraid of new ideas and this is what an intelligent man With an open mind can demolish a bad idea by reasoned argument Do the things that they're doing and that's really I think what you're describing is There's two different types of people that can get to that place now the ones that are doing it like you said on their merits They still have to be doing a good job you can't not not having maneuver in the system and be terrible at what you're doing That's not the majority for sure Fast forward a little bit more the saddest feature of anti intellectualism is that it often reflects an actual suppression of the intellectual activity rather than any lack of ability This is suggested by the rapidity with which so many military men rush into print as soon as they ever retired This talking about people right in books Evidently there was something waiting to get out Unfortunately as Lidel heart points out a lifetime of having to curb the expression of original thought culminates so often in there being nothing left to express So this is talking about I mean this guy is right in the spoken 1976 The problem comes when you have a lot of people like that attracted and even bigger problem comes is when people are getting promoted based on those things and they're not getting promoted based on creativity. You can hit certain strings and certain you doesn't sound right that's because they don't match because they're in congruent They're in disagreement those noises are in disagreement So cognitive dissidents means that you have things in your head that don't agree There's things in your head that don't agree and it's what people do and how people handle things in their head that Don't agree. and then then the ultimate manifestation of that is is a world of war and of like we are going to get online just like we did on the break deck we're literally going to get in a line and move in in a line. Oh, you know in you know Air aerodynamics versus a 2.0 in polysai we don't really care you know that was kind of the Marine Corps's Genre General approach a little bit different for the other services There's some people that do it for that reason totally There's some people do it because they're going I can get promoted next after this so let's check in the box and that piece when you talk about the leadership All I'm thinking is he actually cares about the people. They're like you know you got to You took you seven years to figure out the 50 50 position I got to learn that in 20 minutes on YouTube, right? hey I'm gonna dedicate four years of getting this degree that demonstrates hey you've got some planning You got some interest you've got some intellect something that's gonna reveal that you're Right, but I guess, and not to go too deep into it, what it like, it's not like you're going to have a discipline go with dinner most of the time. And even going out, L.C.T. The elk, they fight hard and occasionally do kill each other, but most of the time, they just aim in, like, I'm dominant, you go away, and the guy's like, cool. If you're in the like, oh my God, I'm gonna look like such an idiot if I don't get this right.
