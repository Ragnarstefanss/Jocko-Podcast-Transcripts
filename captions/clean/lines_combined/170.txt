00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000 Good evening, Echo.
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000 Good evening.
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000 It is time for some Q&A.
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000 Okay. It has been a while.
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000 Yeah.
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000 It's been a while for sure.
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000 So let's question.
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000 Questions from the interwebs.
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000 Yes indeed.
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000 As it is.
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000 Said, okay, first question.
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000 Jockel.
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000 I'm taking over leadership of a team of six people.
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000 Two, I know and four, I don't.
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000 When you've taken over leadership, did you want give a group talk?
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000 Two, meet with each individual and three.
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000 What did you say?
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000 Good question.
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000 Yes, obviously give a group talk.
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000 That's affirmative.
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000 You get everyone together.
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000 Hey guys, my name is Bill.
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000 I came from this place.
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000 I'm here to take over.
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000 Now, there's a, some judgment calls that you have to make.
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000 Because you're going to introduce yourself.
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000 But if you're taking over a well functioning team, then guess what?
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000 You're not going into revamp everything immediately.
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000 Because everything's going fine.
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000 So you're, hey, I'm happy to be working with you guys.
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000 Looking forward to it.
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000 I know you guys have a great reputation.
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000 Glad to be a part of the team.
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000 Awesome.
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000 If you have any questions, let me know.
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000 I'm here.
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000 That's easy.
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000 If you're taking over a team that's not working well.
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000 Like there's problems.
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000 And that's why if somebody got fired, and that's why you're coming in there, you might need to address some of those things.
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000 Hey, listen, I know things have been a little off track.
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000 I'm going to look at what's going on.
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000 I'm going to take input from you guys.
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000 We probably need to make some changes.
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000 We're going to do it together as a team.
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000 That's what we're moving from here.
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000 We need to get back to where we're supposed to be.
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000 Boom, something like that.
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000 And again, there's going to be people on that team that have been busting their ass and working really hard.
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000 And if you go in there and just to spare it, everyone, they're, you're going to start off on the wrong foot.
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000 So, yeah, have keep it pretty broad when you meet the whole group.
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000 Hey, this is who I am.
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000 This is where I came from.
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000 This is what I'm looking forward to.
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000 All that stuff.
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000 And then yes, do you meet with people individually?
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000 Absolutely.
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000 You go around.
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000 You meet with them.
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000 And when you, what are you talking about?
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000 You're talking about them.
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000 You're talking about them.
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000 You want to know about them.
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000 You want to know who they, they are.
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000 You want to know what their, what their family situation is.
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000 What their interests are, what's going on.
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000 How they feel about the transitions that have been taken place a little bit of that stuff.
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000 It's not about you.
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000 It's about them.
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000 So go.
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000 Yes, and talk to everyone.
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000 Take notes.
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000 Maybe not right in front of them.
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000 So you look like a nerd.
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000 But, you know, afterward you go, hey, Bill has three kids.
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000 His wife also works at the company.
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000 He's interested in soccer and basketball.
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000 Whatever you just take those notes.
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000 You know, it's actually good before you take some,
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000 it's an over a situation.
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000 If you already familiarize yourself with us,
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000 you look at the maybe the HR website at your company has a picture of everyone.
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000 So you kind of know who they are.
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000 Give you less stuff to remember.
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000 So there's that.
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000 Make good first impression.
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000 Don't go in there.
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000 Looking like an idiot.
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000 Don't go in there thinking that.
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000 Oh, I just, I'm the boss man.
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000 So everyone has to bow down.
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000 And bow down to my superiority.
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000 No, they're actually mad at you.
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000 Yeah.
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000 The thing is they're mad at you.
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000 So I remember one time I was taking over a small element.
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000 And one of my friends was a part of the element.
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000 And I went in, like 20 guys.
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000 I went in, hey.
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000 And I walked in, but I just had a notebook with like five things.
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000 I wanted to talk to them about.
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000 And as soon as I walked in, I opened up my notebook and he's said something like,
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000 You brought a notebook, you're always squared away.
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000 That's why you're putting in charge.
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000 That's why your put in charge.
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000 So like just a little impression of, hey man, I'm, I take this stuff seriously.
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000 And I would say overall, your main goal when you're meeting your team,
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000 when you're meeting the individuals on your team,
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000 is you are looking to build relationships with the people on the team.
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000 That's what your goal is because when you build these relationships,
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000 that's going to make your team stronger, et cetera.
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000 Yeah.
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000 Remember the time when you were on yoga,
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000 Rog and the first time when he was like, hey, you're the only ones who's ever brought a note pad.
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000 You know, and you're like, just trying to be prepared.
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000 Just trying to be prepared.
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000 It was good.
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000 Okay, so there's anything, you know, you know,
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000 your outfit comes up.
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000 You don't want it to slip your mind.
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000 Yeah, yeah, that's funny.
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000 And I'm trying to imagine being a worker,
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000 and you know, when you get a new manager, you know, whatever new boss.
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000 You know, the come in.
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000 Yeah, if they were like having an individual meeting,
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000 I would dig it, and then, but if they're like taking notes, I'd be like, wait,
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000 where are you taking notes?
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000 Like, well, how are you going to use this?
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000 Yeah, you know, against me later or something like that?
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000 No, sort of, hey, is it all?
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000 Hey, man, how's it going?
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000 How long you've been here for?
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000 Oh, I've been here for four years.
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000 Oh, cool.
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000 Do you, you married?
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000 Yeah, yeah, I got two kids.
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000 Oh, that's awesome.
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.000 That's awesome.
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000 How long you've been married for?
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000 Oh, six years.
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000 Like that.
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000 You're getting no the person.
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000 If I go in there and I go, how long you've been here?
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000 And you're like six years and I write it down.
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.000 Yeah, right.
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000 And then I say, what, what is your primary function here at the team?
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000 You know what I mean?
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000 If you just jump right into that, we're not looking to build relationship.
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000 We're just looking to find out how I can use you.
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000 Yeah, that's what it feels like.
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000 Yeah, I mean, you said it like, you're like, oh, long you've been married.
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000 You said it like that, no, man, doesn't matter how you say, you could say it
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000 the most nice polite way ever.
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000 And when you write it down, it's kind of like, bro, like,
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000 you're going to take all this information and sort of do some sort of
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000 evaluation for me.
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000 You know, kind of, it's what it feels like.
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000 It does feel like that.
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000 That's why I specifically said when you're having a personal conversation with a person
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000 that you're meeting for the first time, you're not scratching it into a
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000 note pad.
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000 Yeah.
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000 Now that being said, if the guy says, you know what?
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000 I've noticed some things here around here that need changing.
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000 You go really hold on a second.
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000 Yeah.
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000 Let me break out my notebook here and take notes on what you're about to say.
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000 Yeah, that's a dance.
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000 You know, if you, yes, like when you get a micromanager, you're working for a
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000 micromanager, bring a notebook.
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000 They see you write and stuff down.
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000 They think they're like happy.
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000 Yeah, trick anyone.
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000 Yeah, because when you're writing down there stuff, that's how it slips the
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000 script.
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000 It makes it like, oh, yeah.
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000 Yeah, he's taking notes to support you.
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000 Yeah, I'm saying, yeah, yeah, I think he's going to evaluate my opinion.
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000 Oh, yeah, that's good.
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000 Well, well, and there with the notebook.
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000 It's like the doctor.
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000 You know, when you go to the doctor and he's asking, oh, yeah, like all the
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000 stuff you see him writing down, you know, in your chart, whatever, even though
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000 a doctor situation is good, because you want him to go evaluate it later, whatever,
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000 you don't give you cure, but same deal, man, same deal,
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000 you're with those notes.
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000 Yeah, my saint.
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000 Jack, Jack, that goes not prepared for you to take notes on a week.
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000 Not with, well, now my personal stuff, how long you've been married?
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000 Oh, nine years old, keep nine years.
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000 It will grab.
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000 You're in your next question.
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000 Next question.
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000 I'm a sergeant, and I want to know how to deal with my men in a way without
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000 punishment, but still make them better for next time.
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000 Okay, here's something for you.
00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000 Punishment is actually the last straw in how you deal with people that you're in
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000 charge of.
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000 In fact, I will tell you this, if I ever had to punish someone, when I had to
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000 administer punishment on my troops, I always felt that I had to, somewhere
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000 I had done some wrong, right?
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000 Like, even if a guy got in trouble out in town, got drunk, got in a fight,
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000 did something stupid.
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000 I would still look at that and think to myself, how could I have allowed this guy
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000 to not realize what a disaster it is, how much trouble he's going to get in,
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000 what kind of international incident he's going to cause, how that's going to
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000 hurt us in the team strategically, all those things.
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000 How did I let that happen?
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000 So, dolling out punishment is not optimal.
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000 I mean, you've pretty much, you've pretty much made a mistake if you have to
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000 punish people because if you're doing, if you're being a good leader, people are
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000 doing what you want them to do.
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000 There's no reason for punishment.
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000 So, that's what you should not be looking to punish and just like I just said, you should be looking to build relationships.
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000 You should be looking to show people a better way of doing things, a way that's more
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000 smooth and more efficient and doesn't disrupt what the team efforts are.
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000 You've got to explain to people why they're doing what they're doing.
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000 This is all stuff, right?
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000 This is to explain why things are done a certain way.
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000 Explain how it impacts the team, explain how it impacts them.
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000 That's all so important.
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:33.000 You've got to have people rehearse in, in retrain because now I'm talking to, how do you get people to do the right thing, right?
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000 Without punishing them.
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000 So, we're trying to avoid punishment.
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000 How do we avoid punishment?
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000 How do we avoid punishment by people understanding what they're doing, why they're doing what they're doing.
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.000 How do we avoid punishment by setting goals that make sense that are small enough for them to get to?
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:58.000 And then have fun with the goals and get in the game yourself and show them that you're not perfect.
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000 And that is what you need to do.
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:10.000 You need to make every effort to make people understand why they're doing, what they're doing, how they fit into the big picture.
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000 And when they figure all that stuff out and they're on board, you shouldn't have to punish people.
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000 You shouldn't have to punish people.
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000 So, I know it's, yeah, that's what it is.
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000 You're your sergeant and you want to do it through men, we're away without punishment.
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000 Well, think of what the mistakes you're making.
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000 When you're when you're fire team or your, your, your pulltune does something wrong.
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000 Why did they make that mistake?
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000 They make the mistake as they wanted to.
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000 No, they made it because you were a bad leader at that point in time.
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000 You, what could you do better?
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000 Hey guys, where, what did you understand?
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000 Oh, you guys messed up this training operation.
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000 I'm going to restrict your weekend duty.
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000 I'm going to restrict you to weekend duty.
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000 Meaning you can't go out and tell.
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000 What, what good did I just do?
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000 Right?
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000 Are they going to try harder now?
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000 Right?
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000 But if you say, hey, listen, guys, we did a bad job.
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000 I know I must have made a mistake in trying to explain this information to you all,
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000 because we didn't do what we were supposed to do.
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000 Let's look, let's dissect this thing.
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000 As a matter of fact, let's spend Friday night dissecting this thing.
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000 I'm buying pizza, then we'll sit around the, the sand table and we'll figure out what,
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000 what we did wrong.
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000 That's not punishment.
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000 That has the opposite effect of punishment.
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000 That has, hey, I'm bringing everyone in because I want to win.
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000 I want us all to win.
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000 So that's what you got to do.
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000 Don't punishment should be punishment should be, I mean, do you have to punish people sometimes?
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000 Yes, yes you do.
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000 When they're blatantly out of line when they do something that's blatantly wrong.
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000 Yeah, you got to drop the hammer on them.
00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000 You got to set the example sometimes.
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000 How you're not going to get away with this?
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000 Sometimes that happened in the dreams.
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000 You know, somebody would do something stupid.
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000 And the command would just drop the hammer.
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000 And everyone goes, man, that guy got a DUI and they, you know,
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000 docked him, they busted him in rank and they pulled him out of his platoon.
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000 And they're sending him to a, to a fleet billet for two years.
00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000 But you're my god.
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000 That might make someone think, right?
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000 You know, maybe I won't step behind the wheel.
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000 Yeah.
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000 So sometimes you do have to punish if people do something stupid,
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000 especially after they've been warned a couple times.
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000 Yeah.
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000 But I always look if I have to deliver punishment on my team.
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000 I made a mistake somewhere.
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000 I don't like it.
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000 Yeah.
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000 Don't they say that like reward and encouragement is like way more powerful than punished.
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000 Definitely way more powerful.
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000 Way more powerful.
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000 For sure.
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000 Seems like it.
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000 I've almost never punished people.
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000 Yeah.
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000 Yeah.
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000 But the reason is why did I punish people?
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000 Because people were doing, weren't doing stupid things.
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000 They were doing what they were supposed to be doing.
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000 They were doing.
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000 Yeah.
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000 I mean, I probably, I don't even know if I,
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000 I probably, I think I had like a one or two captains mass where I had to bring somebody in and drop the hammer on them.
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000 It's because they did dumb stuff.
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000 Yeah.
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000 It's like, man, you know what?
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000 You can't do that.
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000 I didn't think of it.
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000 I'm sorry.
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000 But you can't do that.
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000 Yeah.
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000 Pre-persons.
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000 Yeah.
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000 Next question.
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000 Jockel.
00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000 In the discipline equals freedom field manual, the section fear reads.
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000 How do you overcome fear of failure?
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000 Step.
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000 Go.
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000 But a previous entry reads,
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000 I don't want you to overcome fear of failure.
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000 I want you to be afraid of failure.
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000 Mind the elaborating.
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000 Yeah.
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000 Clearly, there's a dichotomy here.
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000 I know it's my favorite word apparently according to Dean Lister.
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000 Yes.
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000 Okay.
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000 There is a dichotomy here because fear is something good that you should take advantage of.
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000 So it's kind of good to be afraid because it keeps you on edge.
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000 It keeps you from slacking.
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000 It keeps you preparing as much as you possibly can and all that stuff is good.
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000 But at the same time, yes, if you go too far to the other end of the spectrum, fear gets a hold of you.
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000 You can't overcome it.
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000 So you freeze or you cower or you run away and none of those are good reactions.
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000 So what I obviously failed to communicate well in the book,
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000 Dispony goes freedom field manual is the dichotomy between these spectrum,
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000 The spectrum of fear that you can have.
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000 So if you have no fear whatsoever, no fear.
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000 Well, guess what?
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000 You get cocky, you can get arrogant.
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000 If you have too much fear, you can't even get out of the gate.
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000 You just freeze, you hesitate.
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000 So like all dichotomies, you got to balance those two.
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:50.000 And the way you balance those two is to try and do things that make you feel fear.
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000 So that way you get used to it, you can overcome it, you can deal with it, you can utilize it.
00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000 If you have a fighter, you have to see fighters that I'll come afraid every time I get in the ring.
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000 Pretty much everybody.
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000 Yeah, pretty much everybody.
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000 I'm afraid because you're afraid you're going to get knocked out, you're afraid this, you're afraid that.
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000 Frating and losing front of all my family and friends and all that.
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000 So everyone's afraid.
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000 So what does that fear do?
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000 It drives you to train harder.
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000 Drives you to prepare, drives you to keep your hands up and your chin down.
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000 When you're in the key to the end of the world, you're going to have to keep your hands up and your chin down.
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000 When you're in the cage.
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000 Right.
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000 So yeah, there's a healthy level of fear.
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000 It can also get the best of you.
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000 So keep it balanced.
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000 Yeah, we talked about this and I think Sam Harris talked about it first.
00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000 First I heard it made a point not to go too deep into it.
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000 But where, you know, like this, okay, fear, how do you overcome fear, step go.
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000 Right.
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000 It's essentially like take action, be brave in the face of fear.
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000 But if there's no fear, it's kind of like, you're not really being brave.
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000 You're not, you know, kind of think.
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000 Well, that's true, too.
00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000 Yeah.
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000 So consider that notion.
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000 Right.
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000 So you say, yeah, I want you to be afraid of failure.
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000 Oh, yeah, be afraid of failure.
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000 But you still got a step.
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000 You still got to go.
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000 You still got to be brave, you know, kind of thing.
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000 So they do actually kind of compliment each other really.
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000 Unless you think like, oh, yeah, overcome fear, meaning like,
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000 I'm not scared of it anymore.
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000 It's literally not figured it's always fear.
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000 It's more, it's less about the fear being, you know, reduced to zero.
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000 It's more about being brave, training yourself to be brave.
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000 In brace the fear.
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000 Yeah.
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000 In brace the fear.
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000 And the end.
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000 So to continue with that thought, in order to embrace the fear, what do you do?
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000 You step.
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000 Do you go into it.
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000 So there you go.
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000 There's your answer.
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000 Cool.
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000 That's a question.
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000 I was wondering when does standing up for the right thing take precedence
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000 over avoiding conflict?
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000 This is something that leaders have to deal with all the time.
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000 So clearly out of the gate, things that are immoral, unethical, or illegal,
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000 if you participate, you're guilty.
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000 That's the way it is.
00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000 Now things that are a matter of opinion, that's where you might have to play.
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000 The long game, like, maybe you don't want to do something a certain way.
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000 And if you, but if you think, oh, well,
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000 I think the jiu-jitsu class warm-ups should be doing these exercises.
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000 And echo things that should be those exercises.
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000 So echo these things we should do it this way.
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000 No, we should do it this way.
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000 You dig in.
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000 I dig in.
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000 Now we, we, end up saying, well, I'm not going to teach the class.
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000 You know, you end up in these situations.
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000 Well, what's the big deal?
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000 What's, you know, what, what I rather do?
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000 I'd rather play the long game.
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000 I'd rather say, hey man, can you explain why you do those exercises?
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000 Oh, here's another exercise cool that I learned.
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000 Isn't this good for this technique?
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000 Oh, you know how you like when I do this move?
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000 This actually helps me do it even though it's just a warm-up move.
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000 Oh, that's cool.
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000 We build a little relationship.
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000 You get to understand me.
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000 I get to understand you.
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000 Boom.
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000 You also need to say, hey, I'm going to incorporate that into our warm-ups.
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000 So we're going to warm up here, boom.
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000 There you go.
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000 Now I understand that that's the right thing, right?
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000 Because in my mind, I'm thinking, hey,
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000 if these students need to know this escape,
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000 it's the right thing to do.
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000 So I do that.
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000 So you have to weigh it out.
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.000 Yeah.
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000 What am I doing to my relationship in this situation?
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000 If I go along with this, like if you ask me to do nine things that are pretty
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000 menial and you're my boss and I say, yep, cool, got it boss and no problem.
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000 And you ask me to do something else.
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000 It's me.
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000 Yep, cool, got it boss and no problem.
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000 Then you ask me to do something else.
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000 Me, cool, got it boss and no problem.
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000 Then you ask me to do something that's downright stupid and dangerous.
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000 And I go, hey, boss, I need to talk about this.
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000 I'm not sure.
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000 Can you explain to me why we're doing it this way?
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000 Because there's a possibility someone can really get hurt.
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000 You go, oh, well, you've done it.
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000 In your mind, you're thinking you've done these ten things for me.
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000 You've done nine things for me.
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000 You've done seven things for me.
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000 You did them well.
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000 You didn't question me.
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000 Now listen, you have a question.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000 You must have a legitimate question.
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000 That's what we're hoping for.
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000 That's why we're trying to build relationships.
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000 Now, all that being said, yes, we're playing along it.
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000 There are times.
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000 And this is a really sketchy area to enter into.
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000 There are times where something that is happening is immoral, unethical,
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000 or illegal, and you might actually have to kind of go along with it.
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000 I tried to think of a good example of that.
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.000 And I thought of one, Oscar Schindler from Schindler's List.
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000 What did this guy do?
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000 Right?
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000 This guy was a Nazi.
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000 He was a Nazi.
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000 They were exterminating Jews.
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000 And instead of him standing up and saying,
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000 this is wrong to exterminate Jews, I protest.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000 How long would he have lived if he had done that?
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000 Thirty seconds.
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000 Right?
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000 Oh, you don't think Jews should die cool.
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.000 We're killing you.
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000 That was that.
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000 How many people did he save?
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000 Zero.
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000 He would negate if one.
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000 What did he do?
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000 He played the game.
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000 He befriended the Nazi leadership.
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000 He bought them gifts.
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000 He bribed them.
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000 He bought them gifts.
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000 He built relationships with them.
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000 He ended up being able to move his factory and all this other stuff
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000 to save a bunch of Jewish people.
00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000 And he even though he knew,
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000 like he would see them executing people.
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000 He would see them executing Jews.
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000 And he knew it was wrong.
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000 He thought it was wrong.
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000 He felt it was wrong.
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000 And if he would have stood up and said,
00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000 hey, what you're doing is wrong,
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000 then he wouldn't have been able to save anyone.
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000 He would have been killed himself.
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000 So even in that situation,
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:32.000 it's not a guarantee that you need to stand up to do the ethical thing.
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000 Because perhaps there's a chance you can do the more ethical thing
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000 by playing the game building relationships.
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000 Who knows?
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000 Who knows?
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000 Maybe if that war went on.
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000 Maybe he would have said, oh, you know what?
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000 Maybe he would have risen to a position where he,
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000 you know, maybe if the Germans would have won.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000 And he could have said, hey, you know what?
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000 The Jewish people are making good workers here.
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000 I'm going to continue to use them or whatever.
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000 You know, maybe he built up a whole new, you never know.
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000 But when you get rid of your influence,
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000 when you lose your influence,
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000 because you stand up, it might not be the best move.
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000 And the thing that you have to wait for this,
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000 you have to wait with this is you are participating.
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000 And actually, you know, they say Oscar Schindler felt completely guilty
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000 because he did participate and he was a part of what was happening.
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000 He did his best to stop as much as he could,
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000 but he wish he would have stopped more.
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000 And, you know, at some point, maybe you see a little six year old girl
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000 getting shot and you think, you know what?
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000 I should screw it.
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000 I should stand in front of that bullet and take that bullet
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000 for that little girl.
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000 You know, that's the kind of guilt that he felt.
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000 So there are times where you really have to wait
00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000 this out.
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000 And also, I'll tell you, I mean, even in things that aren't this big,
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000 ethical dilemma, head on conflict is generally not the best way
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000 to solve problems.
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000 Most of the time, it's much smarter to maneuver.
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000 It's much smarter to flank, and it's much smarter to come from another angle.
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000 And it's much smarter to build allegiance and alliance with people.
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000 So you can have influence over.
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000 So you can move them in the right direction.
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000 Yeah, so almost like, actually straight up,
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000 where doing the right thing and avoiding conflict is kind of like,
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000 they're not that opposite, you know,
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000 where doing the avoiding, you should, and I'm totally just
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000 interpreting this, trying to do it.
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000 Avoiding conflict, you should always be essentially trying to avoid conflict
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000 as far as, maybe not all the time.
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000 Yeah, but generally speaking, we do a better job.
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000 Then the outcome is better when we avoid conflict.
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000 Now, of course, anyone listening to this,
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000 oh, you take that to extreme.
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000 This is someone that never stands up for anything.
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000 Yeah, and that's bad.
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000 And it's also bad from a leadership perspective.
00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000 If your team is looking at you and they think,
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000 Jockel never sticks up for us.
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000 He never gives the boss any pushback.
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000 So we're just at the whim of this tyrannical boss,
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000 and Jockel is no buffer to it.
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000 That's what they see.
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000 So you can't just be a pushover, but at the same time,
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000 if you go to your troops and you say,
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000 hey, listen, guys, here's what's going on.
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000 The boss has got a lot of ideas right now.
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000 Some of them are good, some of them not so good.
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000 But guess what?
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000 What I'm doing right now, and the reason that we're pushing hard to carry out
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000 what he's trying to get us to do is to the best of our ability.
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000 The reason we're doing that is because I'm actually trying to build some trust
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000 with him so that he will listen to me.
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000 Right now, he's not really listening to me.
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000 He knows I don't have him with much experience,
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000 but I'm trying to build relationships so he can listen to me so we can actually do this
00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000 and what I think is going to be a smarter way.
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000 Can you guys help me build this relationship by kicking ass for the next three projects
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000 that we've got?
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000 So I can build up some cloud and come back to him and get the tools or the people
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000 whatever it is that we need.
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000 Yeah, you always have this real finesse sort of way of saying stuff like you.
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:07.000 It's what I guess you were saying and I think you were wrong actually.
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:21.000 You were saying that standing up and doing the right thing is the same thing as avoiding conflict.
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000 No, I didn't mean it like that.
00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000 I meant that they're not necessarily always opposite.
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000 They're not doing the right thing in avoiding conflict.
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000 There's just some issue wash you kind of room in the wiggle room,
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000 and when I say avoiding you should always be quote unquote avoiding conflict.
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000 I meant, of course, not always, but I meant more.
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000 Even if I'm going to confront someone or something about something that's wrong,
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000 I still should be, while I do that, I should be avoiding conflict.
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000 For sure, doing it in a finesse sort of way to actually just keep everything rolling
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000 forward, maybe just nudging in a different direction.
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.60 But I actually know that I'm sort of reading this again.
00:23:55.60 --> 00:23:57.56 I understand what he's asking.
00:23:57.56 --> 00:23:59.32 It's like, is there a time where it's like,
00:23:59.32 --> 00:24:00.96 hey, there's gonna be conflict?
00:24:00.96 --> 00:24:04.04 Is there a time where it's worth the conflict?
00:24:04.04 --> 00:24:05.44 And where is that point?
00:24:05.44 --> 00:24:07.000 You know, at the point that I always give is,
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.08 if you're telling me, hey, Jocco, go do the mission this way
00:24:10.08 --> 00:24:12.76 and I'm like, you know what, I'm not doing it.
00:24:12.76 --> 00:24:15.08 And you go, okay, find your fire.
00:24:15.08 --> 00:24:18.36 And now, do you put someone some yes man in my place
00:24:18.36 --> 00:24:19.92 and then that yes man gets everyone killed
00:24:19.92 --> 00:24:22.000 because it was a stupid plan.
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:22.84 Did I really help?
00:24:22.84 --> 00:24:25.000 Or should I have said, hey, boss, I'm really gonna recommend
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.76 we do it in a different way here, some different options.
00:24:26.76 --> 00:24:28.76 And then finally you say no, Jocco, you do it my way
00:24:28.76 --> 00:24:31.56 and guess what, even then I can go on mitigate and the field.
00:24:31.56 --> 00:24:33.64 Even then I can say, you know what?
00:24:33.64 --> 00:24:37.20 And the classic example that is in band brothers,
00:24:37.20 --> 00:24:41.88 when Dick Winners of awesome leader,
00:24:41.88 --> 00:24:44.000 they send a recon mission across the river,
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000 one night, someone dies, they come back,
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.44 the war's over, it's all but over.
00:24:49.44 --> 00:24:51.92 And the next night they want to do another reconnaissance mission.
00:24:51.92 --> 00:24:54.04 And Dick Winners is like, sir, I'm not sure that's a great idea.
00:24:54.04 --> 00:24:54.96 He's like, do it.
00:24:54.96 --> 00:24:56.52 He goes, okay, Roger that.
00:24:56.52 --> 00:24:58.84 The guys go down, they drink a couple bottles of wine
00:24:58.84 --> 00:25:01.40 in the bottom of the, they don't do the mission.
00:25:01.40 --> 00:25:02.80 He mitigated the risk.
00:25:02.80 --> 00:25:04.84 If you would have stood up and, you know,
00:25:04.84 --> 00:25:09.16 that's a great example of where he avoided conflict.
00:25:09.16 --> 00:25:10.16 He stayed in the game.
00:25:10.16 --> 00:25:13.64 He wasn't, he said yes, yes sir, got it, we got it.
00:25:13.64 --> 00:25:15.16 And then he did disobeyed.
00:25:15.16 --> 00:25:17.84 Sure, he put his, he put his rank at risk
00:25:17.84 --> 00:25:19.12 and probably could have gotten in some trouble
00:25:19.12 --> 00:25:20.28 but he knew his the right thing to do.
00:25:20.28 --> 00:25:24.68 Yeah, that was like the best sort of way to do him.
00:25:24.68 --> 00:25:29.68 And again, you, you're always thinking of like the long game.
00:25:31.04 --> 00:25:33.36 versus the short game, you know, where it's like,
00:25:33.36 --> 00:25:37.16 and we can keep that perspective, these things become a little bit more clear,
00:25:37.16 --> 00:25:38.40 you know, they always do.
00:25:39.60 --> 00:25:40.60 Yes, sir.
00:25:40.60 --> 00:25:43.48 Next question, Jockel, I recently interviewed for a team,
00:25:43.48 --> 00:25:48.68 lead job, but wasn't selected because I don't have leadership experience.
00:25:48.68 --> 00:25:51.16 How can I lead what I'm not in charge?
00:25:51.16 --> 00:25:52.76 Well, you're in charge of something.
00:25:52.76 --> 00:25:54.72 You're certainly in charge of something.
00:25:54.72 --> 00:25:56.56 You're in charge of some piece of gear.
00:25:56.56 --> 00:25:58.08 You're in charge of some task.
00:25:58.08 --> 00:26:00.40 You're in charge of maybe a couple people here or there,
00:26:00.40 --> 00:26:02.04 but even if you're not, you're in charge of something.
00:26:02.04 --> 00:26:04.84 So whatever you're in charge of, take charge of it.
00:26:05.88 --> 00:26:08.96 Take charge of whatever your task is you take charge of it.
00:26:08.96 --> 00:26:10.44 You own it, you do it to perfection.
00:26:10.44 --> 00:26:12.000 Then once you've got that completely dialed,
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.96 then you know what, you reach out and you see who else you can help.
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.28 You help with other tasks.
00:26:17.28 --> 00:26:20.04 You look for work. If you look for work, you're going to find it.
00:26:20.04 --> 00:26:22.32 You're going to find it.
00:26:22.32 --> 00:26:23.16 You're going to find it.
00:26:23.16 --> 00:26:24.96 You're going to start taking things from other people.
00:26:24.96 --> 00:26:29.28 Now what you have to be careful of is that you don't step on toes, right?
00:26:29.28 --> 00:26:32.40 Because just about everyone, think about this.
00:26:32.40 --> 00:26:35.64 Just about everyone is offended by someone that wants to be in charge.
00:26:35.64 --> 00:26:36.64 Right.
00:26:36.64 --> 00:26:38.44 Hey, let me take charge of this here.
00:26:38.44 --> 00:26:38.92 Right.
00:26:38.92 --> 00:26:41.20 Is that right there makes people cringe?
00:26:41.20 --> 00:26:42.20 What to take lead on this?
00:26:42.20 --> 00:26:43.36 Let me just, you know what?
00:26:43.36 --> 00:26:44.48 Hey, listen up, guys.
00:26:44.48 --> 00:26:45.16 Right.
00:26:45.16 --> 00:26:47.64 If you're that guy, then everyone goes, hmm.
00:26:47.64 --> 00:26:48.92 Now there's a key point.
00:26:48.92 --> 00:26:50.12 This is beautiful.
00:26:50.12 --> 00:26:51.12 This is beautiful.
00:26:51.12 --> 00:26:53.72 So let's say we're in a cartoon.
00:26:53.72 --> 00:26:55.84 There's something going on.
00:26:55.84 --> 00:26:57.92 In a mid grade position.
00:26:57.92 --> 00:27:01.48 And I realize like, I want to be lead, right?
00:27:01.48 --> 00:27:04.20 Now if I just go in and go, hey, guys, let me run this next mission.
00:27:04.20 --> 00:27:05.72 People are like, do you know what are you talking about?
00:27:05.72 --> 00:27:07.20 You don't know anything.
00:27:07.20 --> 00:27:08.60 OK.
00:27:08.60 --> 00:27:11.92 And they're kind of dug in against me, by the way, at that point.
00:27:11.92 --> 00:27:17.16 If I give it a knife, I let things escalate a little bit.
00:27:17.16 --> 00:27:24.68 What I would usually do is I would let things escalate to a point to where when I took
00:27:24.68 --> 00:27:29.04 charge, people were waiting for it and they were happy that I took charge.
00:27:29.04 --> 00:27:31.72 Then even though I was, even though I was tasked in a manner, like if you're tasked
00:27:31.72 --> 00:27:34.36 in a commander, OK, so I got late and stone are working for me.
00:27:34.36 --> 00:27:37.52 I'm tasked in a commander, we're out on an operation.
00:27:37.52 --> 00:27:38.96 Something starts going wrong.
00:27:38.96 --> 00:27:39.96 Right.
00:27:39.96 --> 00:27:43.08 If I'm doing a building clearance with his platoon, something starts going wrong.
00:27:43.08 --> 00:27:46.92 I'd jump down there and say, all right, guys, push over that way, start clearing that hallway.
00:27:46.92 --> 00:27:47.92 How does Lay feel?
00:27:47.92 --> 00:27:49.92 Yeah, kind of.
00:27:49.92 --> 00:27:50.92 Yeah.
00:27:50.92 --> 00:27:51.92 Fees.
00:27:51.92 --> 00:27:55.48 He feels like I jumped down and micromanage his platoon and why are you doing this?
00:27:55.48 --> 00:27:56.48 Everything was going fine.
00:27:56.48 --> 00:27:58.24 So I don't want to do that.
00:27:58.24 --> 00:28:01.44 I want, first of all, I want him to work things out, of course.
00:28:01.44 --> 00:28:03.44 So let's say, same things happening.
00:28:03.44 --> 00:28:05.64 Things are going a little bit bad.
00:28:05.64 --> 00:28:06.96 There's starting to be a little bit of confusion.
00:28:06.96 --> 00:28:10.88 There's starting to be escalated voices. There's starting to people be, you know, hey, wait, wait,
00:28:10.88 --> 00:28:11.88 no, don't go there.
00:28:11.88 --> 00:28:12.88 You can hear it.
00:28:12.88 --> 00:28:14.28 It's really obvious when things are going wrong.
00:28:14.28 --> 00:28:16.76 I might let that escalate a little bit.
00:28:16.76 --> 00:28:20.56 Let it get to a point where the life knows, she doesn't have control this anymore.
00:28:20.56 --> 00:28:23.20 Now like I'm going to go, hey, everyone lock it up.
00:28:23.20 --> 00:28:24.68 You four hold on that hallway.
00:28:24.68 --> 00:28:26.56 You two start clearing that back room.
00:28:26.56 --> 00:28:28.32 Everyone else gets to the rooftop and all security.
00:28:28.32 --> 00:28:29.32 You know what everyone thinks?
00:28:29.32 --> 00:28:30.32 Including life?
00:28:30.32 --> 00:28:31.96 They go, thank God that just happened.
00:28:31.96 --> 00:28:32.96 Right.
00:28:32.96 --> 00:28:35.000 Now, and that can happen from anywhere in the chain of command.
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.92 I'm happening, I happen to be given an example when I was the task commander, but I would
00:28:38.92 --> 00:28:44.40 do the same thing when I was an E5, which is, oh, things are going a little bit sideways.
00:28:44.40 --> 00:28:47.84 No one wants to hear the guy that as soon as they opportunity.
00:28:47.84 --> 00:28:54.20 As soon as there's any void of leadership, you're just jumping in there like, okay, guys,
00:28:54.20 --> 00:28:56.92 Captain America, to the rescue, right?
00:28:56.92 --> 00:28:58.12 You don't want to do that.
00:28:58.12 --> 00:28:59.12 You want to let that.
00:28:59.12 --> 00:29:00.60 I'll tell you what happens.
00:29:00.60 --> 00:29:03.32 If there's a little tiny void that you try and jump into, guess what you're going to do.
00:29:03.32 --> 00:29:06.08 You're going to bump into everyone else that's in that void.
00:29:06.08 --> 00:29:09.20 You have to meet an actual void of leadership.
00:29:09.20 --> 00:29:15.48 Once that actual void of leadership opens up, and it's big enough, you jump in there.
00:29:15.48 --> 00:29:19.60 Because you've detached, because you are detached, because you're watching it happen,
00:29:19.60 --> 00:29:22.48 you jump in there and you have so much confidence in what you're saying.
00:29:22.48 --> 00:29:24.60 You have so much understanding of the situation.
00:29:24.60 --> 00:29:27.92 You look like a genius and everyone's happy that you just did that.
00:29:27.92 --> 00:29:32.20 And by the way, as soon as that problem gets solved, you step back out, the leadership
00:29:32.20 --> 00:29:35.36 void is closed up by someone else and you're good to go.
00:29:35.36 --> 00:29:40.000 And next time, people will not be surprised at all when something goes wrong and you're
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000 stepping and you've solved the problem.
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.72 So that's what you should do.
00:29:43.72 --> 00:29:47.04 You, yes, you want to be in charge, yes, you should look for work, but you can't step on
00:29:47.04 --> 00:29:48.04 toes.
00:29:48.04 --> 00:29:51.80 Don't jump in every time, you get like Captain America.
00:29:51.80 --> 00:29:53.04 I'm going to save the day.
00:29:53.04 --> 00:29:55.12 No, you're not.
00:29:55.12 --> 00:29:59.32 Let there be a real problem, assess it from the outside.
00:29:59.32 --> 00:30:03.48 And like I said, you got to be careful about being Captain America.
00:30:03.48 --> 00:30:04.96 You got to be careful about being on.
00:30:04.96 --> 00:30:07.84 I'm going to, I'm ready to stand up every moment.
00:30:07.84 --> 00:30:08.84 And that's a problem.
00:30:08.84 --> 00:30:14.20 You know, it's a problem when someone's goal is going to sound weird.
00:30:14.20 --> 00:30:19.48 When someone's goal is to be a leader, like my goal is to be a leader.
00:30:19.48 --> 00:30:24.36 Like if that's what they're thinking, that's going to offend people.
00:30:24.36 --> 00:30:25.36 It's going to offend people.
00:30:25.36 --> 00:30:28.08 Because, and I'll say why it offends people to rightfully so.
00:30:28.08 --> 00:30:29.64 You know why it offends people?
00:30:29.64 --> 00:30:30.64 Because what is it about?
00:30:30.64 --> 00:30:32.64 It's about me.
00:30:32.64 --> 00:30:33.84 I want to be a leader.
00:30:33.84 --> 00:30:36.28 I mean me want to lead.
00:30:36.28 --> 00:30:37.28 That's what it's about.
00:30:37.28 --> 00:30:38.88 And everyone recognize that.
00:30:38.88 --> 00:30:42.84 If what you really want to do is you want the team to win.
00:30:42.84 --> 00:30:45.96 And you realize that sometimes you're going to be in a supporting role and sometimes there
00:30:45.96 --> 00:30:51.76 might be in a situation where you need to lead almost hesitantly, you know what?
00:30:51.76 --> 00:30:52.76 Leadership needs to happen.
00:30:52.76 --> 00:30:55.56 I'll go make it happen because the team needs it to win.
00:30:55.56 --> 00:30:57.12 I'm here for the team.
00:30:57.12 --> 00:30:59.40 So don't be the person about yourself.
00:30:59.40 --> 00:31:00.40 We don't like that person.
00:31:00.40 --> 00:31:01.96 I don't even like that person.
00:31:01.96 --> 00:31:05.08 As much as I love people that want to step up and lead, I don't want that person.
00:31:05.08 --> 00:31:09.04 That's like looking for themselves.
00:31:09.04 --> 00:31:10.60 Sometimes you've got to be following.
00:31:10.60 --> 00:31:12.28 I want someone that's like, hey, oh cool.
00:31:12.28 --> 00:31:13.28 I got your back.
00:31:13.28 --> 00:31:14.28 Don't worry about.
00:31:14.28 --> 00:31:15.28 I'm over here.
00:31:15.28 --> 00:31:16.28 I'm over here part of the train.
00:31:16.28 --> 00:31:17.28 I'm over here clearing rooms.
00:31:17.28 --> 00:31:19.04 Oh wait a second, there's a leadership void.
00:31:19.04 --> 00:31:20.52 And now there's an actual problem going on.
00:31:20.52 --> 00:31:22.60 Oh, and then that person suddenly steps up and solves the problem.
00:31:22.60 --> 00:31:24.88 Then goes right back down to their level.
00:31:24.88 --> 00:31:25.88 Awesome.
00:31:25.88 --> 00:31:26.88 That's the person you want.
00:31:26.88 --> 00:31:27.88 That's person you want to be.
00:31:27.88 --> 00:31:30.32 Yeah, you know how like now they're here.
00:31:30.32 --> 00:31:32.48 A lot nowadays where they're add value.
00:31:32.48 --> 00:31:33.76 You just want to add value.
00:31:33.76 --> 00:31:35.28 So what's the sense you're what you're doing?
00:31:35.28 --> 00:31:37.000 Even now that leads to situation.
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.28 It's like boom, I'm going to add value.
00:31:38.28 --> 00:31:40.76 So one, okay, if you're going to start with my own role.
00:31:40.76 --> 00:31:43.28 You know, that's where I'm going to add the most value in my own role.
00:31:43.28 --> 00:31:50.76 But if there's little voids in whatever capacity that needs some value added, I'm going
00:31:50.76 --> 00:31:51.76 to add that value.
00:31:51.76 --> 00:31:54.52 But you can't just be piling on the value where it's not needed.
00:31:54.52 --> 00:31:59.80 No, don't don't put additional value into non-value needing areas exactly.
00:31:59.80 --> 00:32:01.44 That's problematic too much value.
00:32:01.44 --> 00:32:02.44 It's true.
00:32:02.44 --> 00:32:03.44 All right, next question.
00:32:03.44 --> 00:32:05.20 Hi, Jocco.
00:32:05.20 --> 00:32:08.80 When you're trying to take ownership of a mistake made by a fellow team member, what
00:32:08.80 --> 00:32:14.24 do you do if the team leader asks for a step by step step by step breakdown of events?
00:32:14.24 --> 00:32:19.52 I've said it was arm mistake and not to end not made excuses.
00:32:19.52 --> 00:32:24.40 But a step by step breakdown would expose the fact that he alone was responsible for
00:32:24.40 --> 00:32:25.40 that error.
00:32:25.40 --> 00:32:26.40 Interesting.
00:32:26.40 --> 00:32:28.40 Do you think that's interesting?
00:32:28.40 --> 00:32:32.96 It is, wait, so he's saying, okay, it's arm mistake.
00:32:32.96 --> 00:32:38.48 I don't want to individualize this guy or make him stand out of whatever.
00:32:38.48 --> 00:32:40.52 It's arm mistake and we're going to fix it kind of thing.
00:32:40.52 --> 00:32:41.80 And he's like, no, I want the step by step.
00:32:41.80 --> 00:32:45.36 The step step step step step is going to reveal the so-lo.
00:32:45.36 --> 00:32:47.76 Actually, bills fall.
00:32:47.76 --> 00:32:52.20 And now what I tried so hard to take ownership.
00:32:52.20 --> 00:32:55.72 Here's the fault.
00:32:55.72 --> 00:32:59.20 It was actually build that was all jacked up.
00:32:59.20 --> 00:33:00.20 It's actually not my fault.
00:33:00.20 --> 00:33:01.96 It's the truth, right?
00:33:01.96 --> 00:33:02.96 You get that, right?
00:33:02.96 --> 00:33:05.60 Yeah, because check it out.
00:33:05.60 --> 00:33:07.60 Who's responsible?
00:33:07.60 --> 00:33:11.32 When you're taking ownership of something, when you're taking extreme ownership of something,
00:33:11.32 --> 00:33:12.32 whose fault is it?
00:33:12.32 --> 00:33:13.32 Your mind?
00:33:13.32 --> 00:33:14.32 Yeah, sure.
00:33:14.32 --> 00:33:17.12 Was that include when someone else on your team makes a mistake?
00:33:17.12 --> 00:33:18.12 Yes.
00:33:18.12 --> 00:33:19.32 But how can that be?
00:33:19.32 --> 00:33:21.12 Good, it's here.
00:33:21.12 --> 00:33:23.48 So let me ask you these questions.
00:33:23.48 --> 00:33:26.36 Here's what I'd be thinking.
00:33:26.36 --> 00:33:30.12 The teammate was in error.
00:33:30.12 --> 00:33:31.12 Why?
00:33:31.12 --> 00:33:33.56 Why did the teammate make a mistake?
00:33:33.56 --> 00:33:35.84 Why didn't the teammate have backup?
00:33:35.84 --> 00:33:37.76 Why didn't the rest of the members of the team?
00:33:37.76 --> 00:33:42.36 Why didn't I actually go through with him and make sure that he knew how to do that procedure
00:33:42.36 --> 00:33:43.36 properly?
00:33:43.36 --> 00:33:45.16 He's part of my team.
00:33:45.16 --> 00:33:46.92 We're responsible for this taking place.
00:33:46.92 --> 00:33:50.64 I knew he was a little bit shaky and I didn't do anything to fix it.
00:33:50.64 --> 00:33:52.20 That's why it's our fault.
00:33:52.20 --> 00:33:56.08 It's not our fault because we say, oh, it's our fault, but it's really bill.
00:33:56.08 --> 00:33:58.84 That's not what we're talking about.
00:33:58.84 --> 00:34:01.20 The point is, the point is to actually own it.
00:34:01.20 --> 00:34:07.56 So with my coworker fails, I'm literally saying to myself, what mistake did I make that
00:34:07.56 --> 00:34:11.000 my coworker drop the ball?
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.60 What mistake did I make?
00:34:12.60 --> 00:34:15.000 My coworker dropped the ball.
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.20 What mistake did I make?
00:34:17.20 --> 00:34:18.80 Did I not show it to him?
00:34:18.80 --> 00:34:20.44 Did I not ask him if you knew how to do it?
00:34:20.44 --> 00:34:22.000 Did I not ask him if he needed some help?
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.84 Did I not confirm that he knew the procedures correctly?
00:34:24.84 --> 00:34:27.48 All those things are my fault.
00:34:27.48 --> 00:34:32.52 Did I not do a good job of identifying that bill as a little bit slow on the uptake?
00:34:32.52 --> 00:34:36.84 And therefore he needed a little extra preparation for this.
00:34:36.84 --> 00:34:38.000 And now think about this.
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000 What can I do?
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.48 Once I make this mistake, we're going to do the fix.
00:34:40.48 --> 00:34:43.44 I'm going to think about this from a leadership perspective.
00:34:43.44 --> 00:34:47.48 You go down and you say, hey, you guys messed up this thing.
00:34:47.48 --> 00:34:49.04 Why did it happen?
00:34:49.04 --> 00:34:50.92 Now think about the team wherever it goes.
00:34:50.92 --> 00:34:53.16 Well, it's our fault.
00:34:53.16 --> 00:34:55.16 Mostly bill.
00:34:55.16 --> 00:34:56.16 Right?
00:34:56.16 --> 00:34:57.16 Sure.
00:34:57.16 --> 00:35:06.36 And I'll tell you, when I look at a pollotoon and bill made a mistake, I don't look at bill.
00:35:06.36 --> 00:35:08.04 A good leader doesn't just look at bill.
00:35:08.04 --> 00:35:11.28 A good leadership looks at everyone on the team, especially certainly the leadership.
00:35:11.28 --> 00:35:14.08 But I think this guy's talking about from a peer, but it doesn't matter.
00:35:14.08 --> 00:35:19.000 From a peer perspective, if there's a mistake that happens, we are truly response
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.48 possible.
00:35:21.48 --> 00:35:25.56 And then from a leadership perspective, when I go down to the team and I say, hey, guys,
00:35:25.56 --> 00:35:26.56 what happened?
00:35:26.56 --> 00:35:28.08 And they say, well, it was our fault.
00:35:28.08 --> 00:35:29.56 But this is what bill did.
00:35:29.56 --> 00:35:31.16 I go, okay, so you just drop in nine months bill.
00:35:31.16 --> 00:35:32.16 I'm not going to say that.
00:35:32.16 --> 00:35:33.36 But I'm like, I think it's not okay.
00:35:33.36 --> 00:35:34.36 So it's all bill's fault.
00:35:34.36 --> 00:35:35.36 Cool.
00:35:35.36 --> 00:35:36.76 I'll tell you what.
00:35:36.76 --> 00:35:39.64 Whereas if you say, hey, listen, bosses is what happened.
00:35:39.64 --> 00:35:40.96 Here's the procedures we went.
00:35:40.96 --> 00:35:44.84 I don't think we did a good job of briefing bill because here's what bill did.
00:35:44.84 --> 00:35:47.32 He did step three instead of step four.
00:35:47.32 --> 00:35:50.40 I fault we went through twice, but why should have gone through it a couple more times
00:35:50.40 --> 00:35:51.88 and confirmed he knew it was going on?
00:35:51.88 --> 00:35:52.72 It's not going to happen again.
00:35:52.72 --> 00:35:54.04 We got this.
00:35:54.04 --> 00:35:55.72 Which guy you want to work for?
00:35:55.72 --> 00:35:56.80 Which guy do you want?
00:35:56.80 --> 00:35:58.40 Which team do you want?
00:35:58.40 --> 00:36:05.04 You want the team where people are taking ownership of the problem, not blaming Bill.
00:36:05.04 --> 00:36:09.48 Ownership is not just saying we own it.
00:36:09.48 --> 00:36:12.20 Ownership is actually owning it.
00:36:12.20 --> 00:36:14.32 And that's what makes it so powerful.
00:36:14.32 --> 00:36:19.92 If you actually own it, then you actually look at Bill beforehand and you go look in our
00:36:19.92 --> 00:36:20.92 team.
00:36:20.92 --> 00:36:21.92 Do we have any weaknesses?
00:36:21.92 --> 00:36:22.92 Yeah, we do.
00:36:22.92 --> 00:36:25.20 Bill doesn't bill can't get this part of the procedure done right.
00:36:25.20 --> 00:36:26.20 Here's what we're going to do.
00:36:26.20 --> 00:36:28.20 We're going to put Bill into this other position.
00:36:28.20 --> 00:36:29.80 That's an easier part of the procedure.
00:36:29.80 --> 00:36:30.88 We're going to make sure he knows how to do that.
00:36:30.88 --> 00:36:35.000 Meanwhile, we're taking Mike and Mike is going to go down here and he nails this procedure
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.56 and he's going to spend, by the way, in extra 15 minutes a day during lunch, he's going
00:36:38.56 --> 00:36:40.64 to get Bill's trained up so Bill can eventually think.
00:36:40.64 --> 00:36:42.64 That's the kind of thing you do on a team.
00:36:42.64 --> 00:36:43.64 Yeah.
00:36:43.64 --> 00:36:51.08 You made it pretty clear with just, which is kind of, because it's not that easy to understand
00:36:51.08 --> 00:36:52.40 or it wasn't for me anyway.
00:36:52.40 --> 00:36:54.16 I mean, it was put it this way.
00:36:54.16 --> 00:36:58.92 It was very valuable when I didn't understand this about extreme ownership.
00:36:58.92 --> 00:37:00.76 I said this before too, by the way.
00:37:00.76 --> 00:37:04.84 So there's essentially two parts of it that make it extreme ownership.
00:37:04.84 --> 00:37:08.08 Actually, there's three because there's the dichotomy, but aside from the dichotomy, this
00:37:08.08 --> 00:37:09.08 is what it is.
00:37:09.08 --> 00:37:14.80 You take responsibility and then you say what you're going to do to fix the problem.
00:37:14.80 --> 00:37:17.20 And then actually there's a third part, which is you implement the solution.
00:37:17.20 --> 00:37:18.20 Yes, yes, yes.
00:37:18.20 --> 00:37:19.20 You identify it.
00:37:19.20 --> 00:37:20.52 You own the problem.
00:37:20.52 --> 00:37:23.76 You identify a solution for the problem and then you implement the solution.
00:37:23.76 --> 00:37:24.76 Yes.
00:37:24.76 --> 00:37:25.76 That's what you do.
00:37:25.76 --> 00:37:26.76 Yeah.
00:37:26.76 --> 00:37:29.40 So a lot of times, especially in the beginning, like I would just as far as me just kind
00:37:29.40 --> 00:37:33.40 of casually trying to understand it, I would focus so much on taking responsibility.
00:37:33.40 --> 00:37:34.40 You know, it was my fault.
00:37:34.40 --> 00:37:36.40 You know, kind of thing.
00:37:36.40 --> 00:37:44.08 It's like, well, the taking responsibility is arguably more important than saying that
00:37:44.08 --> 00:37:45.84 it's your fault kind of thing.
00:37:45.84 --> 00:37:49.64 It's essentially your taking responsibility of the solution as well.
00:37:49.64 --> 00:37:55.04 If not, in a way, in a lot of practical cases, you don't even have to identify who's
00:37:55.04 --> 00:37:59.16 fault it is if you take responsibility of the solution.
00:37:59.16 --> 00:38:01.48 If I'm okay here.
00:38:01.48 --> 00:38:06.12 So if there's a full-ball team, just like the epitome of team, not the epitome, but
00:38:06.12 --> 00:38:07.56 want a good example of teamwork.
00:38:07.56 --> 00:38:09.68 Never mind the sales teams or whatever, but we're going to go with it.
00:38:09.68 --> 00:38:13.68 Well, football is pretty, it'll be more simple because it's so let's say, okay, we've
00:38:13.68 --> 00:38:18.80 got to pass or whatever and boom, the place, the place starts and a guy gets through the
00:38:18.80 --> 00:38:19.80 front line.
00:38:19.80 --> 00:38:23.80 Let's say the guard missed a block.
00:38:23.80 --> 00:38:25.92 Obviously, right?
00:38:25.92 --> 00:38:26.92 He missed it.
00:38:26.92 --> 00:38:28.72 Maybe he looked one way and he was supposed to look this way.
00:38:28.72 --> 00:38:31.000 He was supposed to not pull and he tried to pull or something.
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000 Maybe he just made a mistake.
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000 He just made a mistake.
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000 He's not incompetent.
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000 He just made a mistake.
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000 Who's fault is it?
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000 Okay.
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.56 But if the quarterback's going to take extreme ownership, he's going to be like, hey,
00:38:40.56 --> 00:38:42.24 no part of the, hey, this happened.
00:38:42.24 --> 00:38:44.96 You know, next time we were, I'm going to remind him of him.
00:38:44.96 --> 00:38:50.60 This play that play, you know, this red 46, don't curve twist whatever.
00:38:50.60 --> 00:38:53.88 Like you don't pull and he probably probably be like, I'm not, I know.
00:38:53.88 --> 00:38:55.64 I know, don't go to school them.
00:38:55.64 --> 00:38:57.76 Just feel like he, you don't go, hey, no problem.
00:38:57.76 --> 00:38:59.20 But we're just not going to do that anymore.
00:38:59.20 --> 00:39:02.36 And then next time I call that play, I'm be like, you're good, right?
00:39:02.36 --> 00:39:03.76 I'm going to check with him.
00:39:03.76 --> 00:39:04.76 I didn't check with him.
00:39:04.76 --> 00:39:05.76 He won't make them a mistake.
00:39:05.76 --> 00:39:06.76 I'm going to check with him.
00:39:06.76 --> 00:39:07.76 He won't make them a mistake.
00:39:07.76 --> 00:39:10.68 And kind of like you, when we were now, we're driving, that he didn't mean, you know?
00:39:10.68 --> 00:39:11.68 It's kind of one of those things.
00:39:11.68 --> 00:39:15.12 The quarterback took responsibility for solving the problem.
00:39:15.12 --> 00:39:18.52 More so than he was like, okay, looks, that was my fault.
00:39:18.52 --> 00:39:20.12 They're making a big deal out of it being his fault.
00:39:20.12 --> 00:39:21.12 Yeah.
00:39:21.12 --> 00:39:23.20 You know, in his head, it is, you know, it's like, okay, this is my fault.
00:39:23.20 --> 00:39:26.52 I should, you know, I should make sure things are clear kind of thing.
00:39:26.52 --> 00:39:28.12 Like the weather, too.
00:39:28.12 --> 00:39:29.12 You know, your weather is bad.
00:39:29.12 --> 00:39:30.12 Yeah.
00:39:30.12 --> 00:39:34.64 Well, what bothers me the most about this question is, I feel like I feel like I feel
00:39:34.64 --> 00:39:38.000 like I don't do a good job of explaining this.
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.24 Because what bothers me out is someone who ever wrote this question.
00:39:41.24 --> 00:39:42.24 And it's a good question.
00:39:42.24 --> 00:39:43.48 I get the question.
00:39:43.48 --> 00:39:47.88 I get scared that the person that's listening to the question goes, no, John, what
00:39:47.88 --> 00:39:48.88 doesn't quite get it.
00:39:48.88 --> 00:39:54.28 He doesn't quite get the fact that there was this one guy who was part of the team, who
00:39:54.28 --> 00:39:56.64 made this mistake.
00:39:56.64 --> 00:40:00.48 And no one, you know, we just, we can't hold his hand every time.
00:40:00.48 --> 00:40:02.28 Like, that's, it's not my fault.
00:40:02.28 --> 00:40:07.04 Not our teams fault when Bill drop completely drops the ball.
00:40:07.04 --> 00:40:08.52 That's not my fault.
00:40:08.52 --> 00:40:10.44 It's not anyone on the team's fault.
00:40:10.44 --> 00:40:15.52 And my point is, is exactly what you are saying, Echo.
00:40:15.52 --> 00:40:17.36 Yes, it is.
00:40:17.36 --> 00:40:23.24 And if you look at it when Bill makes the mistake himself, he's alone in a room.
00:40:23.24 --> 00:40:31.28 And he's supposed to, you know, he's supposed to put part A on top of part B and bolt them
00:40:31.28 --> 00:40:32.12 together.
00:40:32.12 --> 00:40:33.12 His part of the job.
00:40:33.12 --> 00:40:35.24 He's alone in a room doing that.
00:40:35.24 --> 00:40:36.24 And he doesn't do it.
00:40:36.24 --> 00:40:37.24 Right?
00:40:37.24 --> 00:40:38.68 That's 100% his fault.
00:40:38.68 --> 00:40:44.60 The answer is no, actually, who's in charge of training him?
00:40:44.60 --> 00:40:48.28 Who's in charge of checking who, who, not even in charge of who's responsible.
00:40:48.28 --> 00:40:50.28 We are a team.
00:40:50.28 --> 00:40:51.92 That means we work together.
00:40:51.92 --> 00:40:56.16 That means we confirm that we know how to do our individual parts of the job.
00:40:56.16 --> 00:40:58.80 That means we check and say, hey, Bill, are you good?
00:40:58.80 --> 00:41:01.84 Hey, Bill, let me check your first three that you do to make sure you understand what's
00:41:01.84 --> 00:41:02.84 happening.
00:41:02.84 --> 00:41:04.44 We do this together as a team.
00:41:04.44 --> 00:41:11.80 And it makes me feel like a failure that people have a hard time understanding this.
00:41:11.80 --> 00:41:13.76 And I know it can be a stretch.
00:41:13.76 --> 00:41:14.76 It can be a stretch.
00:41:14.76 --> 00:41:16.60 And, you know, I give all those examples.
00:41:16.60 --> 00:41:18.40 Hey, the machine gun or shoots in the wrong direction.
00:41:18.40 --> 00:41:19.40 Who's fault is that?
00:41:19.40 --> 00:41:20.40 It's not the machine.
00:41:20.40 --> 00:41:23.04 The machine gun or literally pointed the machine gun in the wrong direction, pulled
00:41:23.04 --> 00:41:24.84 the trigger and shot in the wrong direction.
00:41:24.84 --> 00:41:26.48 Who's fault is it?
00:41:26.48 --> 00:41:27.80 It's the squad leaders.
00:41:27.80 --> 00:41:28.80 It's the fire team leaders.
00:41:28.80 --> 00:41:30.12 It's the platoon leaders.
00:41:30.12 --> 00:41:32.72 Because they didn't make sure that he understood his field of fire.
00:41:32.72 --> 00:41:34.16 Make sure he understood how to operate his weapon.
00:41:34.16 --> 00:41:38.88 And by the way, there's a chance that the reason that Bill screwed this up and Bill is
00:41:38.88 --> 00:41:42.000 incapable of putting these parts together correctly.
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.68 And if that is the situation, guess what?
00:41:44.68 --> 00:41:48.52 It is a responsibility of the team to either get him trained up to where he can do it or
00:41:48.52 --> 00:41:53.04 to tell the leadership that this guy cannot be incapable of doing the job.
00:41:53.04 --> 00:41:56.60 And therefore, he needs to not be here.
00:41:56.60 --> 00:41:58.04 That's what ownership is.
00:41:58.04 --> 00:42:00.76 That's what extreme ownership is.
00:42:00.76 --> 00:42:02.84 I think I know what it is.
00:42:02.84 --> 00:42:08.20 What makes it confusing or sometimes kind of slippery to grasp.
00:42:08.20 --> 00:42:11.28 Because it depends on who you ask.
00:42:11.28 --> 00:42:15.92 So a lot of times, the thing is when it's the machine gun is fault, the thing is if I'm
00:42:15.92 --> 00:42:20.56 not even a human being, I'm just a disembodied brain.
00:42:20.56 --> 00:42:25.84 Okay, it's the machine gun is fault and the leader is fault and it's everyone's fault.
00:42:25.84 --> 00:42:29.28 If I'm dead, but if you ask the individual person, because you ask a machine gun,
00:42:29.28 --> 00:42:32.80 hey, okay, jockey, you're the machine gun, you shot in the wrong direction and I ask you
00:42:32.80 --> 00:42:33.80 who's fault is that?
00:42:33.80 --> 00:42:34.80 What are you going to say?
00:42:34.80 --> 00:42:35.80 My leader's fault?
00:42:35.80 --> 00:42:36.80 Well, it's your fault.
00:42:36.80 --> 00:42:42.32 Well, let me tell you right now, there are plenty of people and definitely plenty of
00:42:42.32 --> 00:42:45.48 machine gunners that when they shoot that weapon in the wrong direction, no, what they
00:42:45.48 --> 00:42:48.52 say, I didn't get a clear brief on what the field of firework.
00:42:48.52 --> 00:42:52.24 No one, I didn't see the markers for what the range limits were.
00:42:52.24 --> 00:42:54.64 I didn't know where the other blue forces were.
00:42:54.64 --> 00:42:55.64 No one told me.
00:42:55.64 --> 00:42:58.40 So they're looking at it like it actually isn't their fault.
00:42:58.40 --> 00:43:01.08 Now you get some good machine and actually guess what?
00:43:01.08 --> 00:43:05.08 When you have a guy, that's a machine gunner that says, well, what was my fault?
00:43:05.08 --> 00:43:06.08 It was my leader's fault.
00:43:06.08 --> 00:43:07.80 You know what the leader says?
00:43:07.80 --> 00:43:08.80 You know what the leader says?
00:43:08.80 --> 00:43:09.80 What?
00:43:09.80 --> 00:43:10.80 The leader's bad leader.
00:43:10.80 --> 00:43:12.04 The leader in this team.
00:43:12.04 --> 00:43:13.36 The leader in this team, you know what he says?
00:43:13.36 --> 00:43:15.000 No, it was the machine gunner's fault.
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000 That's right.
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.28 And now, guess who's fault it was?
00:43:17.28 --> 00:43:18.28 It was no one's fault.
00:43:18.28 --> 00:43:19.96 The machine gunner think is the boss's fault.
00:43:19.96 --> 00:43:21.28 The boss thinks it was the machine gunner's fault.
00:43:21.28 --> 00:43:22.28 Now who's going to fix the problem?
00:43:22.28 --> 00:43:23.28 The answer is no one.
00:43:23.28 --> 00:43:27.08 When you get a good team, the machine gunner goes to my fault.
00:43:27.08 --> 00:43:28.08 I should have paid their attention.
00:43:28.08 --> 00:43:29.32 The leader says my fault.
00:43:29.32 --> 00:43:33.52 And now you have everyone taking ownership of the problems.
00:43:33.52 --> 00:43:34.52 Yes.
00:43:34.52 --> 00:43:35.80 That's the way it's supposed to be.
00:43:35.80 --> 00:43:36.80 But that's my point.
00:43:36.80 --> 00:43:37.80 And that's why it makes it so hard.
00:43:37.80 --> 00:43:39.92 Never mind your disembodied brain.
00:43:39.92 --> 00:43:41.64 That's making decisions over here.
00:43:41.64 --> 00:43:43.36 I'm trying to make a point though.
00:43:43.36 --> 00:43:45.60 I'm saying this is what it's hard for people to understand.
00:43:45.60 --> 00:43:46.60 That's why sometimes.
00:43:46.60 --> 00:43:47.60 I'm with them.
00:43:47.60 --> 00:43:50.80 I'm like, there it's kind of like, it's kind of like, sure.
00:43:50.80 --> 00:43:52.60 I'm tricking to shoot ownership, you know, the typical.
00:43:52.60 --> 00:43:53.60 I'm taking ownership.
00:43:53.60 --> 00:43:56.56 But yeah, I don't have to end the day or we all know it's built for.
00:43:56.56 --> 00:44:01.76 But the reason that it is so hard because if I ask, okay, we have three guys.
00:44:01.76 --> 00:44:02.96 One of those guys is the machine gunner.
00:44:02.96 --> 00:44:05.36 The other guys are leading the other guys just another team member.
00:44:05.36 --> 00:44:09.24 He's, you know, he's the sniper or something.
00:44:09.24 --> 00:44:11.68 If I say, hey, this machine gunner shot in the wrong direction.
00:44:11.68 --> 00:44:15.36 Individual meetings, they all take extreme ownership, all of them are down.
00:44:15.36 --> 00:44:16.36 They're in the game.
00:44:16.36 --> 00:44:17.36 The all of them.
00:44:17.36 --> 00:44:19.76 I ask you machine gunner.
00:44:19.76 --> 00:44:20.76 Who's fault is that?
00:44:20.76 --> 00:44:21.76 What's he going to say?
00:44:21.76 --> 00:44:24.000 Well, okay, next guy who's faulted.
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000 Fire's you leader.
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000 My fault.
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000 I shouldn't.
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000 And the, yeah.
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000 Squad leader, my fault.
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000 I should have told them.
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.000 Right.
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000 Yeah.
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000 So the read now go back to the disembodied brain.
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.08 It's kind of like, way, way, way.
00:44:34.08 --> 00:44:36.40 So it's like, he did it.
00:44:36.40 --> 00:44:40.44 It's hard to grasp like that.
00:44:40.44 --> 00:44:42.68 One guy, it is his fault.
00:44:42.68 --> 00:44:44.24 The thing is not just his fault.
00:44:44.24 --> 00:44:47.24 Apparently, because everyone said it's their fault.
00:44:47.24 --> 00:44:48.52 So he was obviously his fault.
00:44:48.52 --> 00:44:50.40 But wait, it's everyone's fault kind of thing.
00:44:50.40 --> 00:44:54.000 So when you're the guy and you're saying, okay, his fault, it that little thing creeps
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000 in your brain.
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.72 That's like, yeah, wait, it is his fault.
00:44:56.72 --> 00:44:57.72 Yeah.
00:44:57.72 --> 00:44:58.72 You know, and you're wrong.
00:44:58.72 --> 00:44:59.72 Yeah.
00:44:59.72 --> 00:45:00.72 And you're wrong.
00:45:00.72 --> 00:45:05.000 And I need to do a better job of explaining to people because I see questions
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.64 like this on a fairly regular basis, which is, but hey, really.
00:45:10.64 --> 00:45:13.16 You know, there's a guy, I get ownership, but really.
00:45:13.16 --> 00:45:14.16 Yeah.
00:45:14.16 --> 00:45:15.16 That's what I mean.
00:45:15.16 --> 00:45:17.16 It's the butt, really, that you need to check yourself on.
00:45:17.16 --> 00:45:18.16 Yeah.
00:45:18.16 --> 00:45:21.24 Because the reality is you're responsible.
00:45:21.24 --> 00:45:21.92 Yeah.
00:45:21.92 --> 00:45:22.68 You.
00:45:22.68 --> 00:45:25.24 Wait, but if I'm responsible, what about the machine?
00:45:25.24 --> 00:45:27.88 He just said he's responsible for the machine gunner.
00:45:27.88 --> 00:45:28.88 You're responsible.
00:45:28.88 --> 00:45:31.28 I know, but the machine gunner said he's responsible.
00:45:31.28 --> 00:45:32.16 Let's see what I'm saying now.
00:45:32.16 --> 00:45:35.08 I think that's the feeling that that you let that creep in.
00:45:35.08 --> 00:45:35.44 Yeah.
00:45:35.44 --> 00:45:36.32 And that's going to be a problem.
00:45:36.32 --> 00:45:37.64 Yeah.
00:45:37.64 --> 00:45:39.60 You've seen office space.
00:45:39.60 --> 00:45:40.12 Yeah.
00:45:40.12 --> 00:45:41.12 Yeah.
00:45:41.12 --> 00:45:43.80 So really, when you think about, okay, what's the big thing?
00:45:43.80 --> 00:45:45.68 I don't think he has the movie remembers.
00:45:45.68 --> 00:45:46.52 Yeah, you do.
00:45:46.52 --> 00:45:48.68 Okay, let me remind you, okay.
00:45:48.68 --> 00:45:54.04 So in the beginning, they were like, hey, Peter, we're putting cover sheets on the TPS reports
00:45:54.04 --> 00:45:55.04 from now on.
00:45:55.04 --> 00:45:56.04 We've been doing that.
00:45:56.04 --> 00:45:57.68 You forgot to do that.
00:45:57.68 --> 00:45:58.68 Right?
00:45:58.68 --> 00:46:00.60 So first lumber comes his boss.
00:46:00.60 --> 00:46:03.44 First lumber comes his like, yeah, you know, saying, hey, let me read.
00:46:03.44 --> 00:46:04.44 He didn't do it in a thick way.
00:46:04.44 --> 00:46:08.28 I know I ain't for sure, but he said, hey, this is basically a reminder.
00:46:08.28 --> 00:46:09.28 Did you get that memo?
00:46:09.28 --> 00:46:10.88 We're putting cover sheets on the TPS reports.
00:46:10.88 --> 00:46:12.28 He said, yeah, I just forgot.
00:46:12.28 --> 00:46:13.88 It was one time thing, no problem.
00:46:13.88 --> 00:46:19.16 He's like cool, all that, you know, so if you just do that, do that, that'd be cool.
00:46:19.16 --> 00:46:20.16 And he's like, cool, no problem.
00:46:20.16 --> 00:46:22.44 He's all, I'll even give you another copy of that memo.
00:46:22.44 --> 00:46:24.44 He almost like over did it.
00:46:24.44 --> 00:46:25.44 Not almost he did over do it.
00:46:25.44 --> 00:46:26.44 So he left.
00:46:26.44 --> 00:46:30.24 And then the other boss boom, who was like one level down, he came, same deal.
00:46:30.24 --> 00:46:32.68 Hey, we're putting, did you get that memo?
00:46:32.68 --> 00:46:34.88 TPS reports, cover sheets now, probably.
00:46:34.88 --> 00:46:36.44 He's like, I got the memo.
00:46:36.44 --> 00:46:37.60 I forgot one time thing.
00:46:37.60 --> 00:46:43.60 He's like, yeah, I'm just all those bosses were doing, making sure the problem got solved.
00:46:43.60 --> 00:46:45.12 Right, doing everything in their power.
00:46:45.12 --> 00:46:47.64 Even his other, his friends were like, hey, what's up?
00:46:47.64 --> 00:46:50.000 I heard you guys, you're having problems with your TPS.
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.56 So they were just taking extreme ownership, taking ownership of the problem, trying to solve
00:46:53.56 --> 00:46:54.56 it.
00:46:54.56 --> 00:46:56.40 But we give them crap about it.
00:46:56.40 --> 00:46:58.04 Who do we give a movie?
00:46:58.04 --> 00:46:59.04 You know, movie somewhere?
00:46:59.04 --> 00:47:01.52 Yeah, yeah, because they're trying to make it funny, dude.
00:47:01.52 --> 00:47:02.76 Yeah, I know.
00:47:02.76 --> 00:47:03.76 But that's kind of ironic.
00:47:03.76 --> 00:47:04.76 It's ironic.
00:47:04.76 --> 00:47:05.88 But yeah, I know, but it's ironic, right?
00:47:05.88 --> 00:47:06.88 It is.
00:47:06.88 --> 00:47:07.88 You know.
00:47:07.88 --> 00:47:09.36 So I'm not even mad at Lumberg for that.
00:47:09.36 --> 00:47:10.92 Let's say in the next question.
00:47:10.92 --> 00:47:11.92 Hi, Jockel.
00:47:11.92 --> 00:47:14.44 Question for you. I know you're very busy guy.
00:47:14.44 --> 00:47:18.000 How do you find time to read so many books?
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.16 I have many that I want to read, but I've trouble having enough time.
00:47:23.16 --> 00:47:26.88 Any advice on how to set aside time to do so?
00:47:26.88 --> 00:47:28.88 Yeah, sure.
00:47:28.88 --> 00:47:30.44 All right, land on me.
00:47:30.44 --> 00:47:31.44 Make time.
00:47:31.44 --> 00:47:35.04 What are you doing all day?
00:47:35.04 --> 00:47:38.84 What are you doing all day?
00:47:38.84 --> 00:47:39.84 The clock's sick.
00:47:39.84 --> 00:47:40.84 What are you doing all day?
00:47:40.84 --> 00:47:41.84 Are you watching TV?
00:47:41.84 --> 00:47:44.36 Are you surfing the internet?
00:47:44.36 --> 00:47:46.56 Are you watching YouTube videos?
00:47:46.56 --> 00:47:48.48 That's my question.
00:47:48.48 --> 00:47:51.08 What are you doing before you go to sleep at night?
00:47:51.08 --> 00:47:53.96 Are you looking at Twitter?
00:47:53.96 --> 00:48:02.08 Are you looking at Instagram posts, Instagram videos?
00:48:02.08 --> 00:48:05.60 Tell me they're not like an addiction.
00:48:05.60 --> 00:48:08.44 You get the Instagram video.
00:48:08.44 --> 00:48:11.96 One of them is funny, they're 38 seconds long.
00:48:11.96 --> 00:48:12.96 They're one minute long.
00:48:12.96 --> 00:48:16.60 Get to see people hurt themselves, get to see people do dumb things.
00:48:16.60 --> 00:48:18.28 Make you feel good about yourself.
00:48:18.28 --> 00:48:20.44 I didn't do that dumb thing.
00:48:20.44 --> 00:48:21.44 Someone else did.
00:48:21.44 --> 00:48:22.44 I can laugh at them.
00:48:22.44 --> 00:48:27.08 How long you're going to look at those videos for when you could be reading.
00:48:27.08 --> 00:48:29.56 So there you go.
00:48:29.56 --> 00:48:31.44 Stop wasting a bunch of time.
00:48:31.44 --> 00:48:33.20 And then what about audio books?
00:48:33.20 --> 00:48:36.08 What are you doing when you're mowing the lawn?
00:48:36.08 --> 00:48:38.40 What are you doing when you're trimming the hedges?
00:48:38.40 --> 00:48:40.56 What are you doing when you're pulling weeds?
00:48:40.56 --> 00:48:42.36 What are you doing when you're cleaning the dishes?
00:48:42.36 --> 00:48:44.56 Get some audio books.
00:48:44.56 --> 00:48:46.32 Get some audio books.
00:48:46.32 --> 00:48:48.56 What are you doing first thing in the morning?
00:48:48.56 --> 00:48:50.96 What are you doing?
00:48:50.96 --> 00:49:00.68 Are you waking up, checking your email, sitting around, waiting, wasting a bunch of time?
00:49:00.68 --> 00:49:04.40 Are you getting up early enough that you could just get up and get out of bed?
00:49:04.40 --> 00:49:08.08 Go and read for 30 minutes.
00:49:08.08 --> 00:49:09.08 That's what you have to do.
00:49:09.08 --> 00:49:10.08 You have to make time.
00:49:10.08 --> 00:49:12.08 There's plenty of time to read.
00:49:12.08 --> 00:49:15.08 There's plenty of time to read.
00:49:15.08 --> 00:49:23.08 You probably don't want to read as badly as you think.
00:49:23.08 --> 00:49:26.08 If you wanted to read that bad, you'd make time.
00:49:26.08 --> 00:49:28.08 You make time to breathe somehow.
00:49:28.08 --> 00:49:32.08 If you can make time to breathe, you can make time to read.
00:49:32.08 --> 00:49:34.08 Let's say it's the best.
00:49:34.08 --> 00:49:36.08 Yeah, it would be a better one.
00:49:36.08 --> 00:49:38.08 Because yeah, eat, I think.
00:49:38.08 --> 00:49:41.08 Because read, you can read while you're doing other things sometimes.
00:49:41.08 --> 00:49:42.08 Especially with the others.
00:49:42.08 --> 00:49:48.08 Just kind of as a, so I'm reading, I'm always have to be reading a book to read a book
00:49:48.08 --> 00:49:49.08 for the podcast, right?
00:49:49.08 --> 00:49:54.08 I had only read the first maybe 10 books that we read that we did in the podcast.
00:49:54.08 --> 00:49:56.08 We've done a hundred or something now.
00:49:56.08 --> 00:49:57.08 Probably more than that.
00:49:57.08 --> 00:49:59.08 I don't read like 10 of them.
00:49:59.08 --> 00:50:00.08 Maybe it may be a few more.
00:50:00.08 --> 00:50:02.08 But I'd read them so long ago.
00:50:02.08 --> 00:50:03.08 Maybe I'd read 30.
00:50:03.08 --> 00:50:05.08 But I'd read some of them so long ago that just,
00:50:05.08 --> 00:50:07.08 I had to reread them.
00:50:07.08 --> 00:50:10.08 And so then you said to yourself, okay.
00:50:10.08 --> 00:50:12.08 So when, when you don't when I read all the time,
00:50:12.08 --> 00:50:15.08 I read going about reading, wake up, reading.
00:50:15.08 --> 00:50:18.08 Going in an airplane.
00:50:18.08 --> 00:50:21.08 People, what do people do in an airplane?
00:50:21.08 --> 00:50:23.08 See, watch a movie, I know you sleep.
00:50:23.08 --> 00:50:24.08 They do all this stuff.
00:50:24.08 --> 00:50:25.08 I sleep sometimes in an airplane.
00:50:25.08 --> 00:50:27.08 But if you're not sleeping, you get us a guess on what I'm doing.
00:50:27.08 --> 00:50:28.08 Reading, forever, forever, forever.
00:50:28.08 --> 00:50:29.08 I can't test it out.
00:50:29.08 --> 00:50:30.08 Yeah.
00:50:30.08 --> 00:50:34.08 What do you think is the, like, the biggest ones that people are,
00:50:34.08 --> 00:50:39.08 you know, that you know, the biggest activities that they could,
00:50:39.08 --> 00:50:42.08 yeah, they could just stop.
00:50:42.08 --> 00:50:47.08 And for me, I think the biggest time sucks are YouTube.
00:50:47.08 --> 00:50:50.08 I think Instagram.
00:50:50.08 --> 00:50:51.08 Yeah.
00:50:51.08 --> 00:50:53.08 I think those two are really,
00:50:53.08 --> 00:50:56.08 what's the word stimulating to the brain?
00:50:56.08 --> 00:50:57.08 Yeah.
00:50:57.08 --> 00:50:59.08 And you actually get this weird, like, well, I actually,
00:50:59.08 --> 00:51:01.08 like, I'm going to learn a little something from this right here.
00:51:01.08 --> 00:51:03.08 I'm going to take something away from this.
00:51:03.08 --> 00:51:04.08 I'm going to veg out.
00:51:04.08 --> 00:51:09.08 I'm going to escape from my world right now.
00:51:09.08 --> 00:51:11.08 It's like a scapeysm, right?
00:51:11.08 --> 00:51:12.08 Yeah.
00:51:12.08 --> 00:51:18.08 And they, they actually have algorithms that are,
00:51:18.08 --> 00:51:22.08 that know what you will click on.
00:51:22.08 --> 00:51:24.08 They actually know that about you.
00:51:24.08 --> 00:51:27.08 They mapped your little brain.
00:51:27.08 --> 00:51:31.08 And know that if they put up a video that has,
00:51:31.08 --> 00:51:34.08 if they put up a thumbnail of a video,
00:51:34.08 --> 00:51:38.08 and it's got a heavy machine gun in it,
00:51:38.08 --> 00:51:41.08 they know they got a good chance I'm going to click on it.
00:51:41.08 --> 00:51:42.08 Right?
00:51:42.08 --> 00:51:45.08 And then they give it a catch phrase title, right?
00:51:45.08 --> 00:51:46.08 No.
00:51:46.08 --> 00:51:47.08 They give it a catch phrase title.
00:51:47.08 --> 00:51:49.08 I just get's massacre.
00:51:49.08 --> 00:51:51.08 I got to watch that.
00:51:51.08 --> 00:51:52.08 Got to do it.
00:51:52.08 --> 00:51:52.08 Yeah.
00:51:52.08 --> 00:51:53.08 Oh, click.
00:51:53.08 --> 00:51:54.08 Oh.
00:51:54.08 --> 00:51:57.08 50 cow versus Taliban.
00:51:57.08 --> 00:51:58.08 Oh, cool.
00:51:58.08 --> 00:51:59.08 Black.
00:51:59.08 --> 00:52:01.08 Yeah.
00:52:01.08 --> 00:52:02.08 Yeah.
00:52:02.08 --> 00:52:04.08 And actually, no words you're going to click on.
00:52:04.08 --> 00:52:07.08 And that's, that's, so, and what do you get out of it?
00:52:07.08 --> 00:52:10.08 You watch it for 20 minutes.
00:52:10.08 --> 00:52:11.08 Or game.
00:52:11.08 --> 00:52:12.08 Yeah.
00:52:12.08 --> 00:52:13.08 You get nothing out of it.
00:52:13.08 --> 00:52:14.08 You get a book.
00:52:14.08 --> 00:52:15.08 You read.
00:52:15.08 --> 00:52:16.08 You learn.
00:52:16.08 --> 00:52:17.08 You write something.
00:52:17.08 --> 00:52:18.08 That's what you do.
00:52:18.08 --> 00:52:19.08 Yeah.
00:52:19.08 --> 00:52:20.08 And actually, the YouTube thing is,
00:52:20.08 --> 00:52:25.08 it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's not just YouTube,
00:52:25.08 --> 00:52:27.08 but who's trying to get you to watch the video.
00:52:27.08 --> 00:52:28.08 It's the video makers themselves.
00:52:28.08 --> 00:52:29.08 So YouTube has the algorithm.
00:52:29.08 --> 00:52:31.08 Oh, they got it all kind of sorted out there.
00:52:31.08 --> 00:52:37.08 And now the video makers, they make titles like 50 cow versus XYZ and awful bunch of things too.
00:52:37.08 --> 00:52:38.08 And guess what?
00:52:38.08 --> 00:52:40.08 50 cow versus you can fill in the blank.
00:52:40.08 --> 00:52:42.08 You're probably going to watch that video.
00:52:42.08 --> 00:52:43.08 Doesn't matter.
00:52:43.08 --> 00:52:44.08 Don't matter.
00:52:44.08 --> 00:52:45.08 Motivation speech ever.
00:52:45.08 --> 00:52:46.08 Yes.
00:52:46.08 --> 00:52:47.08 They get with the sentence.
00:52:47.08 --> 00:52:48.08 Oh, yeah.
00:52:48.08 --> 00:52:53.08 So, and so destroys whatever destroys reporter in interview.
00:52:53.08 --> 00:52:54.08 Yeah.
00:52:54.08 --> 00:52:55.08 Exactly.
00:52:55.08 --> 00:52:56.08 Right.
00:52:56.08 --> 00:52:57.08 So once you really owned.
00:52:57.08 --> 00:52:58.08 Yeah.
00:52:58.08 --> 00:53:11.08 So basically, right when you log onto YouTube, once YouTube pops up on your screen, bro, everyone on that screen is all sucking your attention.
00:53:11.08 --> 00:53:13.08 Literally, that's their job sucking your attention.
00:53:13.08 --> 00:53:15.08 So, yeah, man, that's a big one.
00:53:15.08 --> 00:53:16.08 Right, Instagram.
00:53:16.08 --> 00:53:18.08 So here's the, here's one that really hit me really hard.
00:53:18.08 --> 00:53:19.08 The Graham.
00:53:19.08 --> 00:53:20.08 The Graham.
00:53:20.08 --> 00:53:21.08 And I like Instagram.
00:53:21.08 --> 00:53:22.08 It's like, good.
00:53:22.08 --> 00:53:26.08 But if you're like trying to read, you know, if you want to read more, whatever,
00:53:26.08 --> 00:53:31.08 consider like, even like, let's say we start recording this for a second, we're going to look at the boss of our phones.
00:53:31.08 --> 00:53:34.08 We're going to maybe check in email, maybe we got to text or whatever.
00:53:34.08 --> 00:53:37.08 And the probability of Instagram coming up on there.
00:53:37.08 --> 00:53:44.08 We're going to, you know, open it, but the probability of us opening Instagram is pretty significant.
00:53:44.08 --> 00:53:45.08 It's pretty high.
00:53:45.08 --> 00:53:47.08 And you know, scroll through there, whatever.
00:53:47.08 --> 00:53:49.08 Even if you scroll for two, three minutes, right?
00:53:49.08 --> 00:53:50.08 You scroll through there.
00:53:50.08 --> 00:53:54.08 Maybe what you looked at, I don't know, 15, 20 people's posts.
00:53:54.08 --> 00:53:56.08 Read what they had to say.
00:53:56.08 --> 00:54:01.08 But if you have a, what do you, what do you, what do you call like, kindle or something?
00:54:01.08 --> 00:54:02.08 But you do that same thing.
00:54:02.08 --> 00:54:05.08 It's like kind of, like, if you're saying you could read.
00:54:05.08 --> 00:54:06.08 Yeah, read instead.
00:54:06.08 --> 00:54:12.08 So if you had a camera like once you said like, imagine your video, video tape, like, what if you were being video tape all day?
00:54:12.08 --> 00:54:18.08 And all it was calculate every time you opened up Instagram or Facebook or Twitter and or YouTube all those particular.
00:54:18.08 --> 00:54:22.08 Every time you open up, but instead, you had that scenario in one average day.
00:54:22.08 --> 00:54:27.08 Then you take all that time and replace it with you opened your Kindle to read or boss out of book.
00:54:27.08 --> 00:54:29.08 You know, you're bringing books or whatever with you.
00:54:29.08 --> 00:54:32.08 And that's how to, instead of doing that, you did the book.
00:54:32.08 --> 00:54:34.08 Right, and how much reading you do, right, you'd read so much.
00:54:34.08 --> 00:54:35.08 A lot of reading.
00:54:35.08 --> 00:54:36.08 Yeah.
00:54:36.08 --> 00:54:38.08 So it's like, yeah, those are the time sucks, man.
00:54:38.08 --> 00:54:39.08 You're phone.
00:54:39.08 --> 00:54:42.08 It's so available, you know, but right, you can read on your phone too.
00:54:42.08 --> 00:54:43.08 That's a big one.
00:54:43.08 --> 00:54:44.08 TV2.
00:54:44.08 --> 00:54:46.08 You watched TV?
00:54:46.08 --> 00:54:47.08 Not really.
00:54:47.08 --> 00:54:52.08 But I watched one show now. And actually two, Hawaii 5.0 and that's it.
00:54:52.08 --> 00:54:53.08 Sometimes Shark Tank.
00:54:53.08 --> 00:54:54.08 That's it, man.
00:54:54.08 --> 00:54:55.08 100% swear.
00:54:55.08 --> 00:54:56.08 What is it?
00:54:56.08 --> 00:54:58.08 How often is a Hawaii 5.0 on?
00:54:58.08 --> 00:54:59.08 One to week.
00:54:59.08 --> 00:55:00.08 And it goes in season.
00:55:00.08 --> 00:55:01.08 So you got it.
00:55:01.08 --> 00:55:02.08 How long is this season?
00:55:02.08 --> 00:55:03.08 I don't know.
00:55:03.08 --> 00:55:04.08 13 episodes, I guess.
00:55:04.08 --> 00:55:05.08 I don't know.
00:55:05.08 --> 00:55:06.08 I don't know.
00:55:06.08 --> 00:55:07.08 But nonetheless.
00:55:07.08 --> 00:55:10.08 I have watched one TV show recently.
00:55:10.08 --> 00:55:11.08 What?
00:55:11.08 --> 00:55:12.08 It's called billions.
00:55:12.08 --> 00:55:13.08 No, well.
00:55:13.08 --> 00:55:14.08 You know.
00:55:14.08 --> 00:55:18.08 There's a little scenario unfolding on billions.
00:55:18.08 --> 00:55:19.08 So.
00:55:19.08 --> 00:55:20.08 All right.
00:55:20.08 --> 00:55:24.08 Well, you know, actually, yeah, actually, yeah.
00:55:24.08 --> 00:55:28.08 And keep in mind, it's not like I've never seen any other show ever.
00:55:28.08 --> 00:55:29.08 And never will.
00:55:29.08 --> 00:55:30.08 It's not that.
00:55:30.08 --> 00:55:30.08 Yeah.
00:55:30.08 --> 00:55:31.08 I'm just saying, you know how people they like take a watch.
00:55:31.08 --> 00:55:32.08 I know.
00:55:32.08 --> 00:55:38.08 And actually, I will separate the fact that nowadays, you can watch TV in a different way.
00:55:38.08 --> 00:55:39.08 Right.
00:55:39.08 --> 00:55:41.08 It's not like at eight o'clock on a Thursday night.
00:55:41.08 --> 00:55:42.08 You got to sit there and watch.
00:55:42.08 --> 00:55:45.08 It's not like a 30 minute show with the 30 minutes worth of commercials in it.
00:55:45.08 --> 00:55:46.08 Yeah.
00:55:46.08 --> 00:55:46.08 Right.
00:55:46.08 --> 00:55:51.08 No, you can, you're, you're on a flight somewhere.
00:55:51.08 --> 00:55:53.08 You've read, you've got to take it easy on your eyes a little bit.
00:55:53.08 --> 00:55:55.08 If you start reading too much, you've read for a long time.
00:55:55.08 --> 00:55:57.08 Okay, you're going to stare out the window for a little while.
00:55:57.08 --> 00:55:59.08 Listen to this part of a podcast or something.
00:55:59.08 --> 00:56:02.08 Then you're like, okay, my brain is like barely functioning.
00:56:02.08 --> 00:56:03.08 Yeah.
00:56:03.08 --> 00:56:04.08 Okay.
00:56:04.08 --> 00:56:05.08 I'm going to watch an episode of billions.
00:56:05.08 --> 00:56:06.08 Yeah.
00:56:06.08 --> 00:56:07.08 Well, the ballers.
00:56:07.08 --> 00:56:08.08 Everything ballers.
00:56:08.08 --> 00:56:11.08 I don't know the different, well, I do know the different.
00:56:11.08 --> 00:56:12.08 Yeah.
00:56:12.08 --> 00:56:13.08 I just don't know the different.
00:56:13.08 --> 00:56:16.08 It's like, you know, like, you know, like, people have a routine, like,
00:56:16.08 --> 00:56:21.08 tenet, you know, every night for 30 minutes, they watch TV with their kids or whatever.
00:56:21.08 --> 00:56:24.08 It's like that doesn't really happen anymore.
00:56:24.08 --> 00:56:25.08 Yeah.
00:56:25.08 --> 00:56:27.08 Next question.
00:56:27.08 --> 00:56:28.08 You really.
00:56:28.08 --> 00:56:37.08 Sad how much time you can waste these days with the distractions and the people trying to get that time from you.
00:56:37.08 --> 00:56:38.08 Yeah.
00:56:38.08 --> 00:56:40.08 You're, discipline like when you, when you first start saying discipline.
00:56:40.08 --> 00:56:46.08 Oh, when I first started hearing it from you, that was like one of the things that popped into my head, like, as being really obvious.
00:56:46.08 --> 00:56:53.08 Like if you are discipline with your time, you will have a lot of free time, like a lot, a lot of free time.
00:56:53.08 --> 00:56:58.08 Way more than you would think anyway, because, you know, even when I'm like real busy, you know,
00:56:58.08 --> 00:57:02.08 if I can accurately remember my day, I can remember like just like five minutes here,
00:57:02.08 --> 00:57:06.08 15 minutes there, like that I did something that was a waste of time.
00:57:06.08 --> 00:57:09.08 And if you add up all those little minutes, you have probably hours.
00:57:09.08 --> 00:57:12.08 Probably hours for to do whatever.
00:57:12.08 --> 00:57:13.08 Yeah.
00:57:13.08 --> 00:57:20.08 Do something progressive, you know, progressive, progressive, progressive life.
00:57:20.08 --> 00:57:23.08 Value valuable, all those things.
00:57:23.08 --> 00:57:24.08 Check.
00:57:24.08 --> 00:57:25.08 Next question.
00:57:25.08 --> 00:57:34.08 Would your extreme ownership philosophy have changed or lost confidence if you had been relieved of command when taking ownership of friendly fire incident?
00:57:34.08 --> 00:57:36.08 You described being your first book.
00:57:36.08 --> 00:57:39.08 The book, extreme ownership, by the way.
00:57:39.08 --> 00:57:40.08 Yes.
00:57:40.08 --> 00:57:47.08 Just to be perfectly clear about this, I wasn't taking ownership of the situation,
00:57:47.08 --> 00:57:49.08 so that I could keep my job.
00:57:49.08 --> 00:57:54.08 It wasn't a political maneuver to set myself up to look good.
00:57:54.08 --> 00:58:03.08 I was taking ownership of the situation because I was the leader of the situation that took place.
00:58:03.08 --> 00:58:06.08 I was the guy responsible for what was happening.
00:58:06.08 --> 00:58:10.08 I was taking ownership because that was the correct thing.
00:58:10.08 --> 00:58:15.08 The correct thing is something bad and happened and I was in charge of it.
00:58:15.08 --> 00:58:20.08 And yes, I could have been fired.
00:58:20.08 --> 00:58:27.08 And if I would have been fired, I would have accepted it and I wouldn't have done anything different.
00:58:27.08 --> 00:58:32.08 So again, this is sort of similar to a couple of questions ago.
00:58:32.08 --> 00:58:37.08 That extreme ownership is not about avoiding trouble.
00:58:37.08 --> 00:58:38.08 It's not about avoiding trouble.
00:58:38.08 --> 00:58:41.08 You don't say, well, I own it and then you don't get trouble.
00:58:41.08 --> 00:58:44.08 You actually could get fired.
00:58:44.08 --> 00:58:46.08 You actually could get fired.
00:58:46.08 --> 00:58:52.08 And that's why that idea of preemptive ownership.
00:58:52.08 --> 00:58:55.08 I talked about that at one of the monsters.
00:58:55.08 --> 00:58:58.08 If in the back of your mind, if in the back of my mind, I think, you know what?
00:58:58.08 --> 00:59:01.08 If the普通 makes a mistake, I can just blame it on them.
00:59:01.08 --> 00:59:02.08 I'll be good.
00:59:02.08 --> 00:59:05.08 Well, now I'm not really that worried about their plan because I got that little out if I need it.
00:59:05.08 --> 00:59:07.08 I'm not worried about if the guys understand the rules would engage.
00:59:07.08 --> 00:59:09.08 Because I got that a little out if I need it.
00:59:09.08 --> 00:59:12.08 I'm not that worried about deconstruction because I got that little out if they screwed up.
00:59:12.08 --> 00:59:14.08 So I haven't out for myself.
00:59:14.08 --> 00:59:23.08 And so I don't really put 100% effort into the planning and of what we're doing.
00:59:23.08 --> 00:59:25.08 If I have preemptive ownership, where is this?
00:59:25.08 --> 00:59:28.08 Hey, no matter what happens out here, it's my fault.
00:59:28.08 --> 00:59:29.08 Guess what?
00:59:29.08 --> 00:59:30.08 Hey, guys, do you understand the RR's?
00:59:30.08 --> 00:59:31.08 Let me talk to you about him.
00:59:31.08 --> 00:59:36.08 Get hey, hey, Dave, do you guys understand where the lines of limits of advance are?
00:59:36.08 --> 00:59:37.08 So you know where you could.
00:59:37.08 --> 00:59:38.08 Just all your guys don't understand.
00:59:38.08 --> 00:59:39.08 Hey, do we see?
00:59:39.08 --> 00:59:40.08 Do we have it marked out clearly?
00:59:40.08 --> 00:59:41.08 Okay, great.
00:59:41.08 --> 00:59:47.08 Hey, do you know, like dig in and when you dig in on stuff, then you have less of a chance of something going wrong.
00:59:47.08 --> 00:59:51.08 But when something does go wrong and you take ownership of it, you take ownership of it.
00:59:51.08 --> 00:59:54.08 Not to avoid trouble, but to face trouble.
00:59:54.08 --> 00:59:56.08 Hmm.
00:59:56.08 --> 00:59:58.08 That's what you have to do.
00:59:58.08 --> 01:00:02.08 So my idea hasn't changed.
01:00:02.08 --> 01:00:09.08 In fact, if I would have blamed someone else and then kept my job and someone else got inspired,
01:00:09.08 --> 01:00:13.08 I would have had a real problem with that.
01:00:13.08 --> 01:00:16.08 I could not have lived with myself.
01:00:16.08 --> 01:00:21.08 I could not have been able to do that.
01:00:21.08 --> 01:00:24.08 I wouldn't have been able to do that.
01:00:24.08 --> 01:00:29.08 And that's why when I was trying to figure out who the blame it on, because I was, because I was looking at this big problem, because there was a lot of bad things.
01:00:29.08 --> 01:00:34.08 And I'm thinking, I'm thinking, I'm like, okay, who's fault with this?
01:00:34.08 --> 01:00:45.08 And I couldn't figure out why I didn't feel comfortable saying that.
01:00:45.08 --> 01:00:47.08 Saying it was this guy, was that guy?
01:00:47.08 --> 01:00:51.08 It'd be like this guy in the previous one, because it's Bill's fault.
01:00:51.08 --> 01:00:53.08 I don't feel comfortable saying that.
01:00:53.08 --> 01:00:56.08 Especially when I'm in charge, I don't feel comfortable when I'm a peer either.
01:00:56.08 --> 01:01:02.08 If I'm, if my peer, but we're part of a team and something goes wrong, I don't feel comfortable saying it was the other guy.
01:01:02.08 --> 01:01:03.08 Hmm.
01:01:03.08 --> 01:01:04.08 Who does that?
01:01:04.08 --> 01:01:06.08 Who feels good about that, right?
01:01:06.08 --> 01:01:08.08 Don't be that person.
01:01:08.08 --> 01:01:14.08 And only that when you see people acting that way, everybody can identify that that's a bad thing.
01:01:14.08 --> 01:01:17.08 But they do it anyways, because they're ego.
01:01:17.08 --> 01:01:20.08 So keep it in check.
01:01:20.08 --> 01:01:22.08 Yeah.
01:01:22.08 --> 01:01:24.08 Next question.
01:01:24.08 --> 01:01:28.08 Whether directly or indirectly, I know Jockel follows this principle.
01:01:28.08 --> 01:01:31.08 The way you do anything is the way you do everything.
01:01:31.08 --> 01:01:33.08 This is an intro.
01:01:33.08 --> 01:01:42.08 This question, I had to pull out because what you're going to see, it's very, I think it's a question.
01:01:42.08 --> 01:01:45.08 Maybe you might be even more suited to answer than me.
01:01:45.08 --> 01:01:46.08 We'll go ahead and proceed.
01:01:46.08 --> 01:01:47.08 Interesting.
01:01:47.08 --> 01:01:50.08 Now, let's say you're sitting on the couch.
01:01:50.08 --> 01:01:52.08 And you want to switch the light on.
01:01:52.08 --> 01:01:54.08 The switch is to your right.
01:01:54.08 --> 01:02:00.08 And you know there's a 95% chance that you can reach it from where you're sitting without having to leave the couch.
01:02:00.08 --> 01:02:01.08 What do you do?
01:02:01.08 --> 01:02:06.08 Do you take the chance to reach it or to reach for it in vain?
01:02:06.08 --> 01:02:07.08 And then get up.
01:02:07.08 --> 01:02:09.08 Walk to the switch and turn it on.
01:02:09.08 --> 01:02:19.08 Or do you get up right away and make the extra effort and get it done in the most efficient manner, regardless of if there was potentially an easier way.
01:02:19.08 --> 01:02:20.08 I get you.
01:02:20.08 --> 01:02:22.08 I think we know where you sit on this.
01:02:22.08 --> 01:02:26.08 I know I'd love to give some big profound answer about this, but here's the deal.
01:02:26.08 --> 01:02:29.08 I would accurately assess the distance of light switch.
01:02:29.08 --> 01:02:30.08 Oh, accurately.
01:02:30.08 --> 01:02:31.08 Accurately.
01:02:31.08 --> 01:02:32.08 Accurately.
01:02:32.08 --> 01:02:34.08 And I'd figure out the best way to turn it on.
01:02:34.08 --> 01:02:35.08 And then I'd turn it on.
01:02:35.08 --> 01:02:37.08 That's what I do.
01:02:37.08 --> 01:02:40.08 I mean, if I got to get up out of that, I'd get to get better, better bed.
01:02:40.08 --> 01:02:42.08 Or I'd pull a pull.
01:02:42.08 --> 01:02:43.08 We on the couch.
01:02:43.08 --> 01:02:45.08 Is that the situation?
01:02:45.08 --> 01:02:47.08 I want to need the light on.
01:02:47.08 --> 01:02:51.08 So yeah, we'll right get the light on my phone out and see what I got to see with the light.
01:02:51.08 --> 01:02:52.08 Oh, you did that right?
01:02:52.08 --> 01:02:55.08 Because I'm thinking out of the box over on my side.
01:02:55.08 --> 01:02:56.08 That's what I'm doing.
01:02:56.08 --> 01:03:00.08 What you do is as far as the as far as the thing the way you do anything is the way you do everything.
01:03:00.08 --> 01:03:04.08 It's partly true, but at the same time, guess what you got to prioritize next.
01:03:04.08 --> 01:03:11.08 Next. And there are some things that are not as important as other things.
01:03:11.08 --> 01:03:20.08 My famous example is that my gym floor in my home gym is not clean.
01:03:20.08 --> 01:03:21.08 Yep.
01:03:21.08 --> 01:03:22.08 It's there's chalk on it.
01:03:22.08 --> 01:03:23.08 There's some sweat stains.
01:03:23.08 --> 01:03:32.08 I don't go in there three times a week with a mop and swab it and get all the chalk out and power wash it.
01:03:32.08 --> 01:03:33.08 That's what it would take.
01:03:33.08 --> 01:03:40.08 Maybe two times a week if I power washed it, pull all the stuff out of the garage, power wash the mats, pull them back in there, set the garage back up.
01:03:40.08 --> 01:03:43.08 That's what it would take to keep the mats clean.
01:03:43.08 --> 01:03:47.08 That don't care if those mats are cleaner not doesn't matter me.
01:03:47.08 --> 01:03:47.08 Right?
01:03:47.08 --> 01:03:56.08 I have to prioritize there's much, much, much more important things than whether my mats in my garage gym or clean doesn't matter.
01:03:56.08 --> 01:03:57.08 Yeah.
01:03:57.08 --> 01:03:59.08 Did you do mats are different, right?
01:03:59.08 --> 01:04:00.08 Did you do mats got to be clean?
01:04:00.08 --> 01:04:00.08 Yeah.
01:04:00.08 --> 01:04:01.08 Those got to be clean.
01:04:01.08 --> 01:04:04.08 Well, there's what we got people clean those mats after classes.
01:04:04.08 --> 01:04:05.08 Sure.
01:04:05.08 --> 01:04:06.08 That's a priority.
01:04:06.08 --> 01:04:09.08 The ones at my house that just me don't matter.
01:04:09.08 --> 01:04:12.08 That doesn't mean that I'm slacking in other areas.
01:04:12.08 --> 01:04:13.08 Right?
01:04:13.08 --> 01:04:17.08 There's a minimum standard in certain things like there's and even my home gym mats.
01:04:17.08 --> 01:04:22.08 I have a vacuum and I hit them with the vacuum when I get too much dog hair on them.
01:04:22.08 --> 01:04:25.08 Which actually I do that like every one or two days.
01:04:25.08 --> 01:04:28.08 It takes three minutes to just vacuum dog hair.
01:04:28.08 --> 01:04:29.08 Right?
01:04:29.08 --> 01:04:32.08 There's a minimum standard to hold the line.
01:04:32.08 --> 01:04:38.08 And as far as doing things the most efficient way, I try to do things the right way.
01:04:38.08 --> 01:04:39.08 Right?
01:04:39.08 --> 01:04:40.08 Trying to do things the right way.
01:04:40.08 --> 01:04:44.08 Which generally that coincides with the most efficient way.
01:04:44.08 --> 01:04:45.08 Generally.
01:04:45.08 --> 01:04:45.08 Generally.
01:04:45.08 --> 01:04:46.08 There are.
01:04:46.08 --> 01:04:48.08 But here, that's what he's talking about here.
01:04:48.08 --> 01:04:50.08 So when you said, I'm a fifth and a fifth and a fifth.
01:04:50.08 --> 01:04:51.08 Here's a thing man.
01:04:51.08 --> 01:04:56.08 Bro, this guy, you don't, we don't have this name but man, we need to get together and talk.
01:04:56.08 --> 01:04:57.08 This is all of this.
01:04:57.08 --> 01:04:59.08 This is kind of stuff that I think about all the time.
01:04:59.08 --> 01:05:02.08 Not in this obsessive way but in this end of my mind.
01:05:02.08 --> 01:05:04.08 Man, that's a good question too.
01:05:04.08 --> 01:05:06.08 So basically he's asking like, okay.
01:05:06.08 --> 01:05:08.08 And it happens for literally half a second.
01:05:08.08 --> 01:05:09.08 Maybe one whole second.
01:05:09.08 --> 01:05:11.08 Where like, okay man, I need to light on.
01:05:11.08 --> 01:05:12.08 What do I do?
01:05:12.08 --> 01:05:13.08 Do I?
01:05:13.08 --> 01:05:15.08 You know, like how he said, do I reach for it?
01:05:15.08 --> 01:05:16.08 Because that's the easiest way.
01:05:16.08 --> 01:05:17.08 I don't have to stand up.
01:05:17.08 --> 01:05:20.08 He's on my leg and back muscles and stand up and walk over like just reach for it.
01:05:20.08 --> 01:05:22.08 But if I can't reach it.
01:05:22.08 --> 01:05:24.08 Now I got to do, expand all the energy of reaching for it.
01:05:24.08 --> 01:05:29.08 Failing, bringing my hand back and then doing the standing up thing that I was trying to avoid in the first place.
01:05:29.08 --> 01:05:31.08 So it's one of those things.
01:05:31.08 --> 01:05:32.08 So what do I do man?
01:05:32.08 --> 01:05:33.08 What do I do?
01:05:33.08 --> 01:05:34.08 Do I just chance it?
01:05:34.08 --> 01:05:36.08 Or do I just be like, you know, I'm not going to chance anything.
01:05:36.08 --> 01:05:38.08 I'm just going to expand the energy.
01:05:38.08 --> 01:05:39.08 And turn on the light.
01:05:39.08 --> 01:05:40.08 So what do I do?
01:05:40.08 --> 01:05:40.08 Right.
01:05:40.08 --> 01:05:41.08 I mean, to conundrum.
01:05:41.08 --> 01:05:43.08 Same thing with the soy sauce posts.
01:05:43.08 --> 01:05:44.08 Same thing.
01:05:44.08 --> 01:05:45.08 Also here's what here's what you might.
01:05:45.08 --> 01:05:47.08 Did you see the meme?
01:05:47.08 --> 01:05:48.08 Yes.
01:05:48.08 --> 01:05:49.08 There's a couple memes.
01:05:49.08 --> 01:05:51.08 There's a couple memes about you in the soy sauce balls.
01:05:51.08 --> 01:05:52.08 I'm fed three.
01:05:52.08 --> 01:05:55.08 One of them was like a black and white photo.
01:05:55.08 --> 01:05:56.08 Did you see that one?
01:05:56.08 --> 01:05:59.08 I was like a black and white photo, but it said something.
01:05:59.08 --> 01:06:03.08 It was a black and white photo of soy sauce balls.
01:06:03.08 --> 01:06:04.08 Oh yeah.
01:06:04.08 --> 01:06:05.08 What did it say?
01:06:05.08 --> 01:06:06.08 I feel like the strawberry.
01:06:06.08 --> 01:06:08.08 The strawberry was better than the strawberry.
01:06:08.08 --> 01:06:09.08 It was better than the strawberry was real.
01:06:09.08 --> 01:06:10.08 Yeah.
01:06:10.08 --> 01:06:12.08 And then they had the superhero looking guy that had the two buttons.
01:06:12.08 --> 01:06:13.08 Yeah.
01:06:13.08 --> 01:06:14.08 The two buttons.
01:06:14.08 --> 01:06:16.08 Anyway, here's one.
01:06:16.08 --> 01:06:19.08 And here's one that this one's a real problem.
01:06:19.08 --> 01:06:21.08 Small but a real problem for those people.
01:06:21.08 --> 01:06:25.08 When you're laying in bed at night, you're sleeping and you wake up.
01:06:25.08 --> 01:06:27.08 You're like, man, I gotta take it.
01:06:27.08 --> 01:06:29.08 I gotta use bathroom.
01:06:29.08 --> 01:06:30.08 But not too bad.
01:06:30.08 --> 01:06:33.08 I don't have to use bathroom bad just a little bit.
01:06:33.08 --> 01:06:34.08 So what do I do?
01:06:34.08 --> 01:06:35.08 Do I hold it?
01:06:35.08 --> 01:06:40.08 Power through the discomfort because this comfort isn't that bad and hopefully I'll fall asleep.
01:06:40.08 --> 01:06:44.08 Because I don't want to get up and wait myself up more and turn on the light and do all this stuff and walk around
01:06:44.08 --> 01:06:47.08 Get the blood flowing and then what if I can't fall asleep as quick or whatever or I'm tired.
01:06:47.08 --> 01:06:49.08 I don't even want to get out of bed.
01:06:49.08 --> 01:06:52.08 You know, so what do I do?
01:06:52.08 --> 01:06:55.08 Because if I go use a bathroom, oh man, I'll be fully relaxed.
01:06:55.08 --> 01:06:56.08 It'll be done.
01:06:56.08 --> 01:06:57.08 It won't keep me up.
01:06:57.08 --> 01:06:58.08 The discomfort won't keep me up.
01:06:58.08 --> 01:07:01.08 But if I can fall back asleep, I didn't even have to get out of bed.
01:07:01.08 --> 01:07:03.08 I'm just saying.
01:07:03.08 --> 01:07:04.08 So what do you do?
01:07:04.08 --> 01:07:05.08 You're at that.
01:07:05.08 --> 01:07:08.08 And if you really got ease about the misno issue, because it's obvious.
01:07:08.08 --> 01:07:11.08 But if you just have to do a little bit, it's a hard question.
01:07:11.08 --> 01:07:13.08 I can't tell you if you're talking about that.
01:07:13.08 --> 01:07:14.08 Don't even act.
01:07:14.08 --> 01:07:15.08 I know.
01:07:15.08 --> 01:07:16.08 What do you mean?
01:07:16.08 --> 01:07:17.08 I just said that you had problems.
01:07:17.08 --> 01:07:19.08 I've been zero seconds.
01:07:19.08 --> 01:07:21.08 I spend zero seconds thinking about that issue.
01:07:21.08 --> 01:07:22.08 Zero.
01:07:22.08 --> 01:07:24.08 This is no factor whatsoever in my life.
01:07:24.08 --> 01:07:26.08 I'm going to go use bathroom.
01:07:26.08 --> 01:07:29.08 Here's my answer to your question.
01:07:29.08 --> 01:07:30.08 If I have to go to the bathroom, I go to the bathroom.
01:07:30.08 --> 01:07:32.08 What if you kind of have to go to the bathroom?
01:07:32.08 --> 01:07:33.08 There's no kind of thing.
01:07:33.08 --> 01:07:34.08 There's no kind of thing.
01:07:34.08 --> 01:07:35.08 There's no kind of thing.
01:07:35.08 --> 01:07:36.08 I don't want to know.
01:07:36.08 --> 01:07:38.08 Your back is like, if your bladder is full.
01:07:38.08 --> 01:07:39.08 Okay, you got ease about the point.
01:07:39.08 --> 01:07:40.08 What if your bladder is one-third full?
01:07:40.08 --> 01:07:42.08 Then I don't have to go to the bathroom.
01:07:42.08 --> 01:07:46.08 Okay, so you have a distinct cut off then in feelings.
01:07:46.08 --> 01:07:47.08 You don't have that great answer.
01:07:47.08 --> 01:07:48.08 You have that great answer.
01:07:48.08 --> 01:07:49.08 I don't.
01:07:49.08 --> 01:07:50.08 Alright.
01:07:50.08 --> 01:07:51.08 So most of us, we don't have to like that.
01:07:51.08 --> 01:07:52.08 No.
01:07:52.08 --> 01:07:53.08 We've got to like consider.
01:07:53.08 --> 01:07:54.08 No.
01:07:54.08 --> 01:07:56.08 Well the same way that this kind of has to go with.
01:07:56.08 --> 01:07:57.08 No, no, no, no.
01:07:57.08 --> 01:07:58.08 Anyway.
01:07:58.08 --> 01:07:59.08 Anyway.
01:07:59.08 --> 01:08:00.08 I dig it.
01:08:00.08 --> 01:08:03.08 And that's going to be one of those ongoing challenges.
01:08:03.08 --> 01:08:04.08 I think.
01:08:04.08 --> 01:08:05.08 You know?
01:08:05.08 --> 01:08:06.08 I think the main.
01:08:06.08 --> 01:08:09.08 And I almost left that whole second half of the question because the main point
01:08:09.08 --> 01:08:12.08 of the question was the way you do anything is the way you do everything.
01:08:12.08 --> 01:08:13.08 Yes, that's true to a point.
01:08:13.08 --> 01:08:15.08 You should definitely keep, you know.
01:08:15.08 --> 01:08:19.08 You're trying to maintain consistent effort and hold the line and everything.
01:08:19.08 --> 01:08:23.08 But the economy is that if you try and hold the line on every single thing that's not possible
01:08:23.08 --> 01:08:27.08 and you'd spend your whole life cleaning up everything around you and fixing things.
01:08:27.08 --> 01:08:28.08 Yeah.
01:08:28.08 --> 01:08:32.08 What you just, the univ wasting time when you have, you need to prioritize and execute.
01:08:32.08 --> 01:08:33.08 Pick the biggest problems.
01:08:33.08 --> 01:08:35.08 Pick the biggest things you're going to have the most impact on you.
01:08:35.08 --> 01:08:39.08 And then focus on those things and don't worry about some other things.
01:08:39.08 --> 01:08:40.08 Yeah.
01:08:40.08 --> 01:08:42.08 And that's that little conundrum is everywhere.
01:08:42.08 --> 01:08:45.08 But sometimes it'll be vacuuming.
01:08:45.08 --> 01:08:47.08 And then you know how like when you vacuum over like I don't know,
01:08:47.08 --> 01:08:49.08 let's say it's a big piece of land.
01:08:49.08 --> 01:08:51.08 You go over the vacuum once, you know.
01:08:51.08 --> 01:08:52.08 And it doesn't go in.
01:08:52.08 --> 01:08:53.08 You go again.
01:08:53.08 --> 01:08:54.08 It doesn't go in.
01:08:54.08 --> 01:08:57.08 You go, I could have picked that thing up like three, four seconds ago.
01:08:57.08 --> 01:08:58.08 So why didn't you?
01:08:58.08 --> 01:09:02.08 Because I thought I could have, I should get a guy with a vacuum and I wouldn't have to bend down.
01:09:02.08 --> 01:09:03.08 You know what I mean?
01:09:03.08 --> 01:09:04.08 It's like that kind of stuff.
01:09:04.08 --> 01:09:05.08 It depends on the time.
01:09:05.08 --> 01:09:06.08 It's all the time.
01:09:06.08 --> 01:09:07.08 It's a lot of things.
01:09:07.08 --> 01:09:09.08 It's efficiency, not laziness.
01:09:09.08 --> 01:09:10.08 But either way, you know what though?
01:09:10.08 --> 01:09:15.08 It's got you combined with this guy's question and answered the question with how you do everything.
01:09:15.08 --> 01:09:16.08 You just establish a protocol.
01:09:16.08 --> 01:09:18.08 If there's a question, you just do the guaranteed one.
01:09:18.08 --> 01:09:21.08 If I see a piece of the land, I'm a vacuum it.
01:09:21.08 --> 01:09:22.08 It didn't go up, boom, pick it up.
01:09:22.08 --> 01:09:23.08 That's it.
01:09:23.08 --> 01:09:25.08 Maybe you get a double take, right?
01:09:25.08 --> 01:09:26.08 Yeah.
01:09:26.08 --> 01:09:28.08 Because generally you got to go forward and back on a vacuum anyways.
01:09:28.08 --> 01:09:29.08 You know what I'm saying?
01:09:29.08 --> 01:09:30.08 You just rerun that same track.
01:09:30.08 --> 01:09:31.08 Yeah.
01:09:31.08 --> 01:09:35.08 Because you know you're going forward back, but you're offsetting a little bit.
01:09:35.08 --> 01:09:36.08 Yeah.
01:09:36.08 --> 01:09:38.08 And sometimes the back depending on your brush, depending on the back one or the back one.
01:09:38.08 --> 01:09:40.08 Sometimes it's more powerful.
01:09:40.08 --> 01:09:41.08 Okay.
01:09:41.08 --> 01:09:42.08 Because the brush spins a certain way.
01:09:42.08 --> 01:09:43.08 Interesting.
01:09:43.08 --> 01:09:44.08 But either way, yeah.
01:09:44.08 --> 01:09:45.08 But either way you feed.
01:09:45.08 --> 01:09:46.08 Okay.
01:09:46.08 --> 01:09:47.08 And then guess what?
01:09:47.08 --> 01:09:51.08 On the forward stroke, you can go now to your next track and you can bend down grab the
01:09:51.08 --> 01:09:52.08 piece of land.
01:09:52.08 --> 01:09:53.08 You're good to go.
01:09:53.08 --> 01:09:54.08 Yeah.
01:09:54.08 --> 01:09:56.08 So then the point is establish a protocol where it's like, you know what?
01:09:56.08 --> 01:09:57.08 I'm not going to waste my time.
01:09:57.08 --> 01:09:58.08 No.
01:09:58.08 --> 01:09:59.08 You know, risking it and all this stuff.
01:09:59.08 --> 01:10:02.08 I'm just going to go for the real deal.
01:10:02.08 --> 01:10:04.08 Pop them.
01:10:04.08 --> 01:10:05.08 Oh, yeah.
01:10:05.08 --> 01:10:06.08 You know what?
01:10:06.08 --> 01:10:07.08 All right.
01:10:07.08 --> 01:10:12.08 So I'm a firefighter slash EMT, a recently and recently I went on a call where a patient
01:10:12.08 --> 01:10:13.08 didn't live.
01:10:13.08 --> 01:10:15.08 Not unusual by any means.
01:10:15.08 --> 01:10:19.08 Unfortunately, I deal with loss of life on almost a daily basis.
01:10:19.08 --> 01:10:23.08 I detached and do my job always working to get better.
01:10:23.08 --> 01:10:25.08 This call, I failed to detach.
01:10:25.08 --> 01:10:26.08 It hit me hard.
01:10:26.08 --> 01:10:31.08 When the patient's husband let out a chilling, let out chilling screams.
01:10:31.08 --> 01:10:37.08 As his third year old wife went from alert and talking to dead within minutes.
01:10:37.08 --> 01:10:40.08 I let myself enter into his shoes at that moment.
01:10:40.08 --> 01:10:44.08 I got over it quick during my days off and moved on.
01:10:44.08 --> 01:10:46.08 It's part of the job and I accept that.
01:10:46.08 --> 01:10:50.08 But my question is, when does it become inhumane to detach?
01:10:50.08 --> 01:10:55.08 Do we sometimes need to let some weakness through to remain grounded when dealing with such
01:10:55.08 --> 01:10:58.08 major incidents is loss of life?
01:10:58.08 --> 01:10:59.08 Thank you.
01:10:59.08 --> 01:11:02.08 Okay.
01:11:02.08 --> 01:11:05.08 First of all, sympathy and empathy are not weaknesses.
01:11:05.08 --> 01:11:07.08 They're not weaknesses.
01:11:07.08 --> 01:11:14.08 In fact, it actually takes strength to be able to deal with these types of situations
01:11:14.08 --> 01:11:16.08 and these types of emotions.
01:11:16.08 --> 01:11:22.08 The weak move would actually be to cut those emotions off completely.
01:11:22.08 --> 01:11:31.08 So that being said, as you know, obviously there is a dichotomy.
01:11:31.08 --> 01:11:35.08 Because you cannot let the emotions overwhelm you.
01:11:35.08 --> 01:11:40.08 As a matter of fact, if you get overwhelmed by your feelings,
01:11:40.08 --> 01:11:45.08 then you can't do your job properly, which in its own right is inhumane.
01:11:45.08 --> 01:11:48.08 Because now you're not able to treat the patients that you're trying to save.
01:11:48.08 --> 01:11:50.08 Because you're getting too emotional about it.
01:11:50.08 --> 01:11:54.08 So what do you have to do? The answer for the millionth time of a different subject,
01:11:54.08 --> 01:11:56.08 but comes up all the time, you've got to find balance.
01:11:56.08 --> 01:12:00.08 You have to find balance between being emotional enough,
01:12:00.08 --> 01:12:07.08 but not being too emotional. You have to learn to recognize if you're going too far in one direction.
01:12:07.08 --> 01:12:09.08 Or the other, you have to do a self-assessment.
01:12:09.08 --> 01:12:17.08 You have to look and see and make sure that that you see the people you're treating as people.
01:12:17.08 --> 01:12:20.08 You have to look at them and make sure that you're seeing them as people.
01:12:20.08 --> 01:12:23.08 That you're not seeing them as a hunk of meat, right?
01:12:23.08 --> 01:12:26.08 You have to do that. You have to make sure that you're doing that.
01:12:26.08 --> 01:12:35.08 At the same time, you cannot afford emotionally to go through the pain of loss every time you see someone die.
01:12:35.08 --> 01:12:40.08 Because that's also going to be a problem. You can't afford emotionally to do that.
01:12:40.08 --> 01:12:46.08 You can't go through that pain over and over and over again.
01:12:46.08 --> 01:12:54.08 So you have to, like you said, you have to detach and normally do a good job with that.
01:12:54.08 --> 01:12:57.08 Obviously, you guys get wounded.
01:12:57.08 --> 01:13:00.08 I've seen guys get killed. I've been around a lot of death.
01:13:00.08 --> 01:13:05.08 And when it was around me, I didn't have time to stop and think about it.
01:13:05.08 --> 01:13:09.08 I had to work to do. I had to detach myself and do my job.
01:13:09.08 --> 01:13:14.08 At the same time, when it's over and the time was appropriate,
01:13:14.08 --> 01:13:22.08 it's like you've got to connect with what happened and make sure that you are dealing with it appropriately.
01:13:22.08 --> 01:13:28.08 And I always think firefighters and paramedics and EMTs and police and military,
01:13:28.08 --> 01:13:35.08 but paramedics and EMTs, you're only showing up if someone isn't a bad way.
01:13:35.08 --> 01:13:40.08 And I know that's hard physically and it's hard mentally and it's hard emotionally.
01:13:40.08 --> 01:13:49.08 So find a balance, keep yourself balanced, make sure you're not going too far in one direction or the other.
01:13:49.08 --> 01:13:53.08 And thanks for doing your job.
01:13:53.08 --> 01:13:59.08 Man, that's like easy, but sometimes you forget that about EMTs.
01:13:59.08 --> 01:14:03.08 Like that's the only time where they spread.
01:14:03.08 --> 01:14:04.08 I mean, pretty much.
01:14:04.08 --> 01:14:07.08 Yeah, EMTs are getting called because someone is in a bad way.
01:14:07.08 --> 01:14:08.08 That's the whole thing.
01:14:08.08 --> 01:14:10.08 What they're showing up for.
01:14:10.08 --> 01:14:12.08 And cops too.
01:14:12.08 --> 01:14:19.08 It's easy to be on the outside when you're going to parks and if your job is like,
01:14:19.08 --> 01:14:24.08 I don't know, I press record, make videos or whatever.
01:14:24.08 --> 01:14:26.08 And this is like every day.
01:14:26.08 --> 01:14:30.08 So it kind of forms this vision, my world, whatever.
01:14:30.08 --> 01:14:32.08 But EMTs.
01:14:32.08 --> 01:14:36.08 And every time you get to call it, it's just the question is just,
01:14:36.08 --> 01:14:38.08 Oh, how bad.
01:14:38.08 --> 01:14:44.08 You know, that's what it is, how bad, how bad of a situation is the person I'm about to go content with.
01:14:44.08 --> 01:14:46.08 What's their situation?
01:14:46.08 --> 01:14:51.08 They are, they could be everything from a minor situation to they're going to die in front of me.
01:14:51.08 --> 01:14:56.08 Again, this new person, and their life and their kids and their family.
01:14:56.08 --> 01:15:02.08 And you know, Peter T. talked about some of that becoming a bit jaded.
01:15:02.08 --> 01:15:08.08 In fact, it's a pretty horrific story and it's worth listening to that podcast when he was on.
01:15:08.08 --> 01:15:15.08 He talked about how he got to a point where some patients he started to look at like,
01:15:15.08 --> 01:15:18.08 He'd be mad at them, mad at them.
01:15:18.08 --> 01:15:23.08 And that's what you have to avoid is getting to this point.
01:15:23.08 --> 01:15:30.08 You got to do your best to stay emotionally detached enough that you can do your job.
01:15:30.08 --> 01:15:38.08 But at the same time, you can't be looking at other human beings as if they're just a piece of meat.
01:15:38.08 --> 01:15:42.08 So, part job.
01:15:42.08 --> 01:15:47.08 I think we got time for one more question.
01:15:47.08 --> 01:15:51.08 I have good ideas, but I have trouble executing.
01:15:51.08 --> 01:15:56.08 Do you have any tips?
01:15:56.08 --> 01:16:01.08 I have good ideas, but I have trouble executing.
01:16:01.08 --> 01:16:06.08 Do you have any tips?
01:16:06.08 --> 01:16:11.08 Oh yeah.
01:16:11.08 --> 01:16:16.08 You have some good ideas, do you?
01:16:16.08 --> 01:16:19.08 But you can't execute.
01:16:19.08 --> 01:16:25.08 You want to know what those ideas are worth?
01:16:25.08 --> 01:16:29.08 There's nothing.
01:16:29.08 --> 01:16:39.08 Ideas by themselves have zero value unless they can be brought to life.
01:16:39.08 --> 01:16:46.08 And I have known plenty of people with plenty of ideas over the years.
01:16:46.08 --> 01:16:47.08 Great ideas.
01:16:47.08 --> 01:16:49.08 Amazing ideas.
01:16:49.08 --> 01:16:57.08 But very few people can actually turn ideas into action.
01:16:57.08 --> 01:17:04.08 And those people end up old and bitter and angry because they didn't execute their great ideas.
01:17:04.08 --> 01:17:06.08 And so here's what you do.
01:17:06.08 --> 01:17:09.08 You execute.
01:17:09.08 --> 01:17:12.08 You actually make things happen.
01:17:12.08 --> 01:17:16.08 And sometimes I'm going to tell you when you execute your idea,
01:17:16.08 --> 01:17:21.08 it reveals the fact that your idea isn't all that good.
01:17:21.08 --> 01:17:24.08 It's not the brilliant idea you thought it was.
01:17:24.08 --> 01:17:26.08 And some people are actually afraid of that.
01:17:26.08 --> 01:17:28.08 And that's what stops them.
01:17:28.08 --> 01:17:30.08 But I'm not afraid.
01:17:30.08 --> 01:17:33.08 I say, but bring on that failure.
01:17:33.08 --> 01:17:38.08 Let me learn that my idea is no good.
01:17:38.08 --> 01:17:42.08 Because even if you learn that your idea is garbage,
01:17:42.08 --> 01:17:47.08 you know not to waste any more time dreaming about it or thinking about it.
01:17:47.08 --> 01:17:50.08 Go on to your next idea.
01:17:50.08 --> 01:17:55.08 But don't let these ideas just wander aimlessly around in your head.
01:17:55.08 --> 01:17:58.08 Get them out.
01:17:58.08 --> 01:18:02.08 Bring them to life, put them into the world, run with them.
01:18:02.08 --> 01:18:06.08 And get some friends and family or partners.
01:18:06.08 --> 01:18:07.08 Someone to help you.
01:18:07.08 --> 01:18:10.08 Maybe get some people that are better at execution than you are.
01:18:10.08 --> 01:18:12.08 And give them some ownership.
01:18:12.08 --> 01:18:13.08 Give away those ideas.
01:18:13.08 --> 01:18:18.08 It's better to give away those ideas than let them rot inside your head and die.
01:18:22.08 --> 01:18:29.08 And whatever path you take, whether you force yourself to execute or you bring people into help you,
01:18:29.08 --> 01:18:31.08 whatever path you're going to take, do it.
01:18:31.08 --> 01:18:32.08 Do it.
01:18:32.08 --> 01:18:36.08 Pour some life into your idea.
01:18:36.08 --> 01:18:47.08 And like I said, you've got to remember that there's no guarantee that when you pour life into idea,
01:18:47.08 --> 01:18:52.08 into an idea, there's no guarantee that that idea is going to come to life too.
01:18:52.08 --> 01:18:57.08 You might pour everything you've got to that idea and it can still die.
01:18:57.08 --> 01:19:02.08 And you might have to let it die.
01:19:02.08 --> 01:19:07.08 You have to let the dream die because some ideas aren't good enough to live.
01:19:07.08 --> 01:19:08.08 That's just the way it is.
01:19:08.08 --> 01:19:11.08 But you know what?
01:19:11.08 --> 01:19:15.08 At least give it a chance.
01:19:15.08 --> 01:19:19.08 Don't let that idea die inside your head.
01:19:19.08 --> 01:19:27.08 No more waiting, no more putting it off or waiting for the right time or the right people or the right alignment of things in the world.
01:19:27.08 --> 01:19:34.08 No more of that, no more excuses, just execution.
01:19:34.08 --> 01:19:43.08 Just go and make it happen.
01:19:43.08 --> 01:19:49.08 And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
01:19:49.08 --> 01:19:56.08 So echo Charlie while we are over here trying to make things happen.
01:19:56.08 --> 01:19:59.08 So we have to go hard.
01:19:59.08 --> 01:20:00.08 We have to execute.
01:20:00.08 --> 01:20:04.08 You got anything that could possibly help us execute.
01:20:04.08 --> 01:20:05.08 Yeah.
01:20:05.08 --> 01:20:06.08 Our mission.
01:20:06.08 --> 01:20:07.08 Sure.
01:20:07.08 --> 01:20:09.08 Where do you go?
01:20:09.08 --> 01:20:11.08 Well, talk about origin first.
01:20:11.08 --> 01:20:17.08 This is an outstanding way to execute and maintain the execution.
01:20:17.08 --> 01:20:24.08 So while we are doing you just to and you don't know what kind of get it yet, which would be crazy.
01:20:24.08 --> 01:20:27.08 But hey, people are starting every day.
01:20:27.08 --> 01:20:29.08 And when you start you do have that question.
01:20:29.08 --> 01:20:30.08 Most of the time.
01:20:30.08 --> 01:20:33.08 What's the maximum age for starting GJ2?
01:20:33.08 --> 01:20:34.08 Death.
01:20:34.08 --> 01:20:36.08 I think it's the day before you die.
01:20:36.08 --> 01:20:38.08 The day before that could be 100, whatever.
01:20:38.08 --> 01:20:39.08 Yeah.
01:20:39.08 --> 01:20:44.08 The reason you don't start the day before you die is you don't want to go to your deathbed with regret.
01:20:44.08 --> 01:20:47.08 Because as soon as you even learn a little bit of GJ2, you be like dang.
01:20:47.08 --> 01:20:49.08 I wish I would have started that a month ago.
01:20:49.08 --> 01:20:50.08 Yes.
01:20:50.08 --> 01:20:55.08 Month of solid GJ2.
01:20:55.08 --> 01:20:56.08 Yeah.
01:20:56.08 --> 01:20:57.08 Yeah.
01:20:57.08 --> 01:20:58.08 So yeah.
01:20:58.08 --> 01:21:03.08 We have people all the time starting GJ2 all ages from four or five.
01:21:03.08 --> 01:21:05.08 Below that, yes, you should be training.
01:21:05.08 --> 01:21:06.08 Your little kids should be trained GJ2.
01:21:06.08 --> 01:21:09.08 But it's more of a playful thing that you do with them because you know the techniques.
01:21:09.08 --> 01:21:11.08 And you have them escape the mountain.
01:21:11.08 --> 01:21:12.08 You start to have them arm lock you.
01:21:12.08 --> 01:21:14.08 You start to have them put in that rear naked choke.
01:21:14.08 --> 01:21:17.08 You got to make sure you tell them that the rear naked choke is dangerous and not to do it.
01:21:17.08 --> 01:21:20.08 If you're not around because that is actually a scary thing.
01:21:20.08 --> 01:21:24.08 I used to be a little bit nervous about that when my kids were real little.
01:21:24.08 --> 01:21:25.08 Yeah.
01:21:25.08 --> 01:21:26.08 They know how to rear naked choke.
01:21:26.08 --> 01:21:32.08 You know, oh, maybe my five year old daughter slaps a rear naked choke on my two year old son.
01:21:32.08 --> 01:21:33.08 Right.
01:21:33.08 --> 01:21:37.08 And decides, you know, to hang onto that thing because he's crying or whatever.
01:21:37.08 --> 01:21:40.08 So you got to be very careful with that.
01:21:40.08 --> 01:21:41.08 Yeah.
01:21:41.08 --> 01:21:42.08 Yeah.
01:21:42.08 --> 01:21:46.08 And that's a simple deal where it's not like a knife or something.
01:21:46.08 --> 01:21:48.08 Or something where it's like, hey, this is dangerous.
01:21:48.08 --> 01:21:52.08 Don't you know, it's like, it's a little bit more cut in dry with the rear naked choke.
01:21:52.08 --> 01:22:01.08 It's kind of like, okay, you have to deliberately apply the choke and execute the choke for it to be dangerous.
01:22:01.08 --> 01:22:03.08 Not like a knife or something.
01:22:03.08 --> 01:22:06.08 If you got little tiny kids below the, like,
01:22:06.08 --> 01:22:11.08 For two, three, four, five, yes, you teach them basic moves.
01:22:11.08 --> 01:22:15.08 You need to explain to them that the moves are real.
01:22:15.08 --> 01:22:16.08 Yeah.
01:22:16.08 --> 01:22:18.08 And they do work.
01:22:18.08 --> 01:22:23.08 And that's I always warn the little kids about the ones kids are a little bit older than they understand.
01:22:23.08 --> 01:22:25.08 Because it happens them and they know what's going on.
01:22:25.08 --> 01:22:31.08 So be careful with that part of Jiu Jitsu for the little kids, but whether kids are.
01:22:31.08 --> 01:22:36.08 For or whether you're 60 or 70 or 80 years old, go get your Jiu Jitsu on.
01:22:36.08 --> 01:22:38.08 Going to need a G.
01:22:38.08 --> 01:22:40.08 The G and or a Rascart action or Rascart.
01:22:40.08 --> 01:22:41.08 And the Rascart.
01:22:41.08 --> 01:22:42.08 At least one.
01:22:42.08 --> 01:22:44.08 So what kind of G, origin, G.
01:22:44.08 --> 01:22:45.08 Planeted choose from.
01:22:45.08 --> 01:22:46.08 Planeted choose from.
01:22:46.08 --> 01:22:47.08 Planeted.
01:22:47.08 --> 01:22:49.08 Increasing by the as time goes on.
01:22:49.08 --> 01:22:50.08 Straight up.
01:22:50.08 --> 01:22:52.08 All made in America.
01:22:52.08 --> 01:22:55.08 And factually the besties in the world.
01:22:55.08 --> 01:22:56.08 Yeah.
01:22:56.08 --> 01:23:01.08 And when you buy an origin G, you are.
01:23:01.08 --> 01:23:08.08 You are investing not only in yourself, but you're also investing in this great country.
01:23:08.08 --> 01:23:15.08 As we rebuild manufacturing inside our country, bringing back the old New England factories
01:23:15.08 --> 01:23:17.08 that they sent overseas.
01:23:17.08 --> 01:23:18.08 We're bringing it back.
01:23:18.08 --> 01:23:20.08 We're actually bringing it back.
01:23:20.08 --> 01:23:21.08 We are.
01:23:21.08 --> 01:23:24.08 We're buying equipment back from overseas.
01:23:24.08 --> 01:23:26.08 Bringing it back here on ships.
01:23:26.08 --> 01:23:28.08 Can you imagine that's happening right now?
01:23:28.08 --> 01:23:29.08 We are doing that.
01:23:29.08 --> 01:23:30.08 You are doing that.
01:23:30.08 --> 01:23:32.08 You are making that happen.
01:23:32.08 --> 01:23:33.08 Also.
01:23:33.08 --> 01:23:34.08 We got jeans.
01:23:34.08 --> 01:23:36.08 Here's the deal.
01:23:36.08 --> 01:23:37.08 I talked to Pete.
01:23:37.08 --> 01:23:38.08 Pete Roberts.
01:23:38.08 --> 01:23:39.08 Origin.
01:23:39.08 --> 01:23:42.08 I said, Pete, how many people do you know the dude, G, G, G, G?
01:23:42.08 --> 01:23:45.08 And he's like, oh, 100.
01:23:45.08 --> 01:23:48.08 I said, how many people do you know that own pair of jeans?
01:23:48.08 --> 01:23:51.08 And he said, 200 million.
01:23:51.08 --> 01:23:54.08 I said, we need to make jeans.
01:23:54.08 --> 01:23:55.08 Everyone wants jeans.
01:23:55.08 --> 01:23:56.08 Everyone needs jeans.
01:23:56.08 --> 01:24:03.08 Everyone would want jeans that are not only high quality, but also made in America.
01:24:03.08 --> 01:24:07.08 They're sold by craftsmen in Maine.
01:24:07.08 --> 01:24:11.08 So, yeah, we got Origin jeans.
01:24:11.08 --> 01:24:12.08 They're awesome.
01:24:12.08 --> 01:24:13.08 We got American denim.
01:24:13.08 --> 01:24:15.08 American denim.
01:24:15.08 --> 01:24:16.08 Like it.
01:24:16.08 --> 01:24:17.08 Cotton cotton.
01:24:17.08 --> 01:24:18.08 Cotton yes.
01:24:18.08 --> 01:24:19.08 Yeah, sewn here.
01:24:19.08 --> 01:24:20.08 Later jean.
01:24:20.08 --> 01:24:21.08 So is it grown?
01:24:21.08 --> 01:24:22.08 There you go.
01:24:22.08 --> 01:24:24.08 I was probably Pete Roberts had come up with that one.
01:24:24.08 --> 01:24:25.08 Yeah.
01:24:25.08 --> 01:24:26.08 A grown and so on in America.
01:24:26.08 --> 01:24:27.08 Baby.
01:24:27.08 --> 01:24:28.08 Boom.
01:24:28.08 --> 01:24:29.08 There it is.
01:24:29.08 --> 01:24:30.08 But also joggers.
01:24:30.08 --> 01:24:31.08 Speaking of pants.
01:24:31.08 --> 01:24:40.08 You're not allowed to do joggers, but for us who like comfort and functionality.
01:24:40.08 --> 01:24:43.08 Maybe a twist to style, whatever this one is.
01:24:43.08 --> 01:24:46.08 Why don't we keep bringing up joggers specifically?
01:24:46.08 --> 01:24:48.08 Is it because of my experience with the joggers?
01:24:48.08 --> 01:24:49.08 I like the joggers.
01:24:49.08 --> 01:24:50.08 People like joggers.
01:24:50.08 --> 01:24:51.08 And you can also get supplements.
01:24:51.08 --> 01:24:52.08 We have supplements.
01:24:52.08 --> 01:24:53.08 We have joint warfare.
01:24:53.08 --> 01:24:54.08 We have acrylic.
01:24:54.08 --> 01:24:55.08 We have discipline.
01:24:55.08 --> 01:24:56.08 We have discipline.
01:24:56.08 --> 01:24:57.08 Go.
01:24:57.08 --> 01:24:58.08 According to JP D'Nell.
01:24:58.08 --> 01:25:03.08 When he takes discipline go, he can see people's thoughts.
01:25:03.08 --> 01:25:04.08 Yeah.
01:25:04.08 --> 01:25:07.08 I'm like, he was so fired up.
01:25:07.08 --> 01:25:09.08 He did a, you know, an event for us long front.
01:25:09.08 --> 01:25:11.08 He's like, he's like, I was so fired up.
01:25:11.08 --> 01:25:12.08 I could see people's thoughts.
01:25:12.08 --> 01:25:14.08 And I'm like, I like the way that sounds.
01:25:14.08 --> 01:25:15.08 So discipline go.
01:25:15.08 --> 01:25:19.08 Little new trophic to get the mind kicking.
01:25:19.08 --> 01:25:21.08 And then you got discipline for pre-workout.
01:25:21.08 --> 01:25:22.08 Crayloil.
01:25:22.08 --> 01:25:23.08 Joy warfare.
01:25:23.08 --> 01:25:25.08 Keep the bones.
01:25:25.08 --> 01:25:26.08 The tendons.
01:25:26.08 --> 01:25:27.08 Legiments.
01:25:27.08 --> 01:25:27.08 Legiments.
01:25:27.08 --> 01:25:29.08 Keep all that stuff.
01:25:29.08 --> 01:25:30.08 Good to go.
01:25:30.08 --> 01:25:31.08 Maintained.
01:25:31.08 --> 01:25:32.08 Uninflation.
01:25:32.08 --> 01:25:33.08 So there's inflammation.
01:25:33.08 --> 01:25:35.08 What's the anti-inflammation?
01:25:35.08 --> 01:25:37.08 So keep them anti-inflammed.
01:25:37.08 --> 01:25:38.08 Keep them moving.
01:25:38.08 --> 01:25:39.08 Keep them lubricated.
01:25:39.08 --> 01:25:41.08 Keep them functioning.
01:25:41.08 --> 01:25:42.08 Very important.
01:25:42.08 --> 01:25:43.08 And in milk.
01:25:43.08 --> 01:25:44.08 We got milk.
01:25:44.08 --> 01:25:47.08 Some people don't even know what milk is.
01:25:47.08 --> 01:25:49.08 And it's really easy to explain.
01:25:49.08 --> 01:25:50.08 Milk is milk.
01:25:50.08 --> 01:25:51.08 Yeah.
01:25:51.08 --> 01:25:55.08 It happens to have what 22 grams of protein in there.
01:25:55.08 --> 01:25:56.08 Yeah.
01:25:56.08 --> 01:25:57.08 And protein.
01:25:57.08 --> 01:25:58.08 Two by the way.
01:25:58.08 --> 01:25:59.08 Which is different.
01:25:59.08 --> 01:26:00.08 You know?
01:26:00.08 --> 01:26:01.08 And it's delicious.
01:26:01.08 --> 01:26:02.08 You have very delicious.
01:26:02.08 --> 01:26:04.08 And that was, I'll talk to my friend Kenny.
01:26:04.08 --> 01:26:05.08 The other day.
01:26:05.08 --> 01:26:06.08 He's like, oh yeah.
01:26:06.08 --> 01:26:08.08 So we're all doing two special about this thing.
01:26:08.08 --> 01:26:10.08 And I got past a detached, you know.
01:26:10.08 --> 01:26:12.08 I got past your emotional effort.
01:26:12.08 --> 01:26:13.08 A little bit emotional.
01:26:13.08 --> 01:26:16.08 But I was like, I started like going into this whole pitch to my friend.
01:26:16.08 --> 01:26:18.08 By the way, it turned out to be a pitch.
01:26:18.08 --> 01:26:20.08 But just like how it's all clean.
01:26:20.08 --> 01:26:22.08 And we, you know, monk fruit to sweeten it.
01:26:22.08 --> 01:26:24.08 And it's like, doesn't taste like some diet.
01:26:24.08 --> 01:26:26.08 I think whatever's like a dessert at the end of the day.
01:26:26.08 --> 01:26:28.08 I think I think you accepted the pitch.
01:26:28.08 --> 01:26:31.08 The best thing to do if someone wants to know, you get mixed one up.
01:26:31.08 --> 01:26:32.08 Yeah.
01:26:32.08 --> 01:26:34.08 Because when as soon as you mix one up, people are like, oh, yeah.
01:26:34.08 --> 01:26:35.08 I'm going to get it.
01:26:35.08 --> 01:26:36.08 I'm getting this now.
01:26:36.08 --> 01:26:37.08 Because how can this be good for you?
01:26:37.08 --> 01:26:38.08 Yeah.
01:26:38.08 --> 01:26:39.08 That's the question.
01:26:39.08 --> 01:26:40.08 How can this be good for you?
01:26:40.08 --> 01:26:41.08 Yeah.
01:26:41.08 --> 01:26:42.08 Tastes like that.
01:26:42.08 --> 01:26:43.08 True.
01:26:43.08 --> 01:26:46.08 Mid chocolate, peanut butter chocolate, vanilla gorilla.
01:26:46.08 --> 01:26:47.08 Darkness, the chocolate.
01:26:47.08 --> 01:26:48.08 The darkness.
01:26:48.08 --> 01:26:49.08 Darkness.
01:26:49.08 --> 01:26:53.08 And then there's this is what I believe to be kind of epic.
01:26:53.08 --> 01:26:55.08 Warrior kid milk.
01:26:55.08 --> 01:26:56.08 Yes.
01:26:56.08 --> 01:26:59.08 Because warrior kid milk, you can go to your grocery store.
01:26:59.08 --> 01:27:02.08 And you can buy something that will flavor the milk.
01:27:02.08 --> 01:27:04.08 So that your kids will drink milk.
01:27:04.08 --> 01:27:07.08 But while your drink while you're giving the milk,
01:27:07.08 --> 01:27:10.08 you're also giving them poison.
01:27:10.08 --> 01:27:11.08 You.
01:27:11.08 --> 01:27:12.08 Right.
01:27:12.08 --> 01:27:13.08 Sugar poison or is enough.
01:27:13.08 --> 01:27:14.08 Yeah.
01:27:14.08 --> 01:27:15.08 You're going to eat enough sugar that you die.
01:27:15.08 --> 01:27:16.08 Yeah.
01:27:16.08 --> 01:27:17.08 Right.
01:27:17.08 --> 01:27:18.08 People do it all the time.
01:27:18.08 --> 01:27:19.08 They get diabetes.
01:27:19.08 --> 01:27:20.08 Yeah.
01:27:20.08 --> 01:27:22.08 So we don't want to give our kids poison.
01:27:22.08 --> 01:27:24.08 We want to give them power.
01:27:24.08 --> 01:27:25.08 How do we do it?
01:27:25.08 --> 01:27:26.08 We got warrior kid milk.
01:27:26.08 --> 01:27:28.08 We got strawberry and chocolate.
01:27:28.08 --> 01:27:29.08 They taste amazing.
01:27:29.08 --> 01:27:31.08 They are engineered.
01:27:31.08 --> 01:27:33.08 The best possible food that your kids
01:27:33.08 --> 01:27:35.08 Gonna eat.
01:27:35.08 --> 01:27:36.08 Yeah.
01:27:36.08 --> 01:27:37.08 Think about it.
01:27:37.08 --> 01:27:38.08 You can say, oh, you want some dessert.
01:27:38.08 --> 01:27:39.08 And they're get all excited.
01:27:39.08 --> 01:27:41.08 Here, have a strawberry milkshake.
01:27:41.08 --> 01:27:43.08 And what do they think?
01:27:43.08 --> 01:27:44.08 Thank you.
01:27:44.08 --> 01:27:45.08 Yeah.
01:27:45.08 --> 01:27:46.08 Can I have more?
01:27:46.08 --> 01:27:47.08 And you know what you say?
01:27:47.08 --> 01:27:48.08 Sure.
01:27:48.08 --> 01:27:49.08 Of course you can.
01:27:49.08 --> 01:27:50.08 You can have all you want.
01:27:50.08 --> 01:27:51.08 Yeah.
01:27:51.08 --> 01:27:53.08 And probiotics and vitamins.
01:27:53.08 --> 01:27:57.08 This is everything you're supposed to be eating as a child to grow up and be strong.
01:27:57.08 --> 01:27:59.08 And a world beater.
01:27:59.08 --> 01:28:00.08 You.
01:28:00.08 --> 01:28:02.08 The time.
01:28:02.08 --> 01:28:03.08 All right.
01:28:03.08 --> 01:28:04.08 Check.
01:28:04.08 --> 01:28:05.08 Yes.
01:28:05.08 --> 01:28:06.08 Okay.
01:28:06.08 --> 01:28:08.08 Also, if you want to stay in the bath and represent at the same time.
01:28:08.08 --> 01:28:10.08 A tire wise.
01:28:10.08 --> 01:28:11.08 Chocolate store.
01:28:11.08 --> 01:28:12.08 It's called Jocco store.
01:28:12.08 --> 01:28:14.08 So you're going to jocco store.com.
01:28:14.08 --> 01:28:17.08 That's where you can get your t-shirts.
01:28:17.08 --> 01:28:18.08 More trash.
01:28:18.08 --> 01:28:23.08 And it's good to have more than one rash card for multiple reasons.
01:28:23.08 --> 01:28:28.08 One is that if one gets dirty, you don't have to rush to wash it or rush to get it back in the rotation.
01:28:28.08 --> 01:28:29.08 And necessarily.
01:28:29.08 --> 01:28:31.08 It could be a whole decision making process.
01:28:31.08 --> 01:28:32.08 You got to deal with it.
01:28:32.08 --> 01:28:33.08 It's possible.
01:28:33.08 --> 01:28:34.08 It's possible.
01:28:34.08 --> 01:28:35.08 It's possible.
01:28:35.08 --> 01:28:36.08 Yes.
01:28:36.08 --> 01:28:37.08 But you know what I ran into.
01:28:37.08 --> 01:28:39.08 And this is so psychological.
01:28:39.08 --> 01:28:42.08 So I, you know, I, whatever, I have a bunch of rash cards.
01:28:42.08 --> 01:28:44.08 So I get injured wearing this one rash card.
01:28:44.08 --> 01:28:46.08 And I, I don't, why are it anymore?
01:28:46.08 --> 01:28:48.08 Because I'm like, oh, it made me injured.
01:28:48.08 --> 01:28:49.08 Yeah.
01:28:49.08 --> 01:28:50.08 You think superstition.
01:28:50.08 --> 01:28:51.08 Yeah.
01:28:51.08 --> 01:28:53.08 But he's think I know that superstition is fake.
01:28:53.08 --> 01:28:56.08 But you know what I'm superstitious about?
01:28:56.08 --> 01:28:57.08 Being superstitious.
01:28:57.08 --> 01:28:58.08 No, no, I don't care.
01:28:58.08 --> 01:29:00.08 Yeah, see if it's hurt than hurt you bro.
01:29:00.08 --> 01:29:01.08 I know, bro.
01:29:01.08 --> 01:29:02.08 I know exactly what hurt me.
01:29:02.08 --> 01:29:03.08 That's what makes it even worse.
01:29:03.08 --> 01:29:04.08 Either way.
01:29:04.08 --> 01:29:05.08 Whether that's your,
01:29:05.08 --> 01:29:07.08 Are you going to retire the rash card that you wore today?
01:29:07.08 --> 01:29:09.08 When were you training?
01:29:09.08 --> 01:29:10.08 No.
01:29:10.08 --> 01:29:11.08 No.
01:29:11.08 --> 01:29:11.08 No.
01:29:11.08 --> 01:29:12.08 Are you sure?
01:29:12.08 --> 01:29:12.08 No.
01:29:12.08 --> 01:29:13.08 Cause.
01:29:13.08 --> 01:29:16.08 I can't see.
01:29:16.08 --> 01:29:18.08 I see what you did there.
01:29:18.08 --> 01:29:19.08 No, that none of the way.
01:29:19.08 --> 01:29:21.08 Rascar to work today was all good.
01:29:21.08 --> 01:29:24.08 It was, the problem I had today was psychological.
01:29:24.08 --> 01:29:27.08 And it wasn't really actually you were my problem.
01:29:27.08 --> 01:29:28.08 Straight up.
01:29:28.08 --> 01:29:29.08 You were my problem.
01:29:29.08 --> 01:29:30.08 Yeah.
01:29:30.08 --> 01:29:31.08 That's the extreme.
01:29:31.08 --> 01:29:33.08 I thought it was funny though.
01:29:33.08 --> 01:29:36.08 For all my jiditsu career, you know, if I have a good role with someone
01:29:36.08 --> 01:29:39.08 and I, and I, and I, you know, do good against them.
01:29:39.08 --> 01:29:41.08 A lot of times they say,
01:29:41.08 --> 01:29:43.08 you're really strong, right?
01:29:43.08 --> 01:29:45.08 They never say like, oh, you got good jiditsu.
01:29:45.08 --> 01:29:48.08 They never say, oh, like I liked your guard passing.
01:29:48.08 --> 01:29:51.08 Or, hey, you got a really good hit movement.
01:29:51.08 --> 01:29:52.08 No, they don't say that.
01:29:52.08 --> 01:29:54.08 Whether they say is you're strong.
01:29:54.08 --> 01:29:55.08 Yeah.
01:29:55.08 --> 01:29:56.08 That's what they say.
01:29:56.08 --> 01:29:57.08 Mm.
01:29:57.08 --> 01:30:01.08 Today I got my first kind of alternate compliment from echo Charles.
01:30:01.08 --> 01:30:03.08 You didn't say I was strong?
01:30:03.08 --> 01:30:04.08 No.
01:30:04.08 --> 01:30:07.08 You said I psychologically destroyed you.
01:30:07.08 --> 01:30:08.08 Yeah.
01:30:08.08 --> 01:30:12.08 I know.
01:30:12.08 --> 01:30:13.08 What was the whole thing?
01:30:13.08 --> 01:30:17.08 Okay, so you and you've been doing this kind of recently where like,
01:30:17.08 --> 01:30:20.08 I can't, I don't even have to be breathing hard, but just maybe just a little.
01:30:20.08 --> 01:30:21.08 You'll like act.
01:30:21.08 --> 01:30:23.08 You'll be like, put on this little shirt.
01:30:23.08 --> 01:30:25.08 Like, oh, like, or all like push here or something.
01:30:25.08 --> 01:30:26.08 You're like, oh, man.
01:30:26.08 --> 01:30:30.08 Like, you won't say that, but your body will be like, oh, that push is so hard.
01:30:30.08 --> 01:30:31.08 So you'll do that.
01:30:31.08 --> 01:30:32.08 And I know what you're doing.
01:30:32.08 --> 01:30:36.08 Obviously, because you make it obvious, but then what that does to me is like,
01:30:36.08 --> 01:30:37.08 man, it's like,
01:30:37.08 --> 01:30:40.08 you don't really take me seriously right now.
01:30:40.08 --> 01:30:45.08 So it kind of makes nothing angry, but a little bit like frustrated because I'm trying to do a little.
01:30:45.08 --> 01:30:46.08 Something else.
01:30:46.08 --> 01:30:47.08 It sounds like something.
01:30:47.08 --> 01:30:55.08 And then yeah, then when you wind up like doing things and then I'll kind of look at you and kind of feel.
01:30:55.08 --> 01:30:58.08 And then you do this real good normal face kind of scenario.
01:30:58.08 --> 01:31:03.08 And I think that I can do good normal face too, but on the inside, I don't feel normal face.
01:31:03.08 --> 01:31:06.08 But all I see is like, you're just, just being whatever.
01:31:06.08 --> 01:31:10.08 And it doesn't look like just so you don't on the inside and the outside, you don't.
01:31:10.08 --> 01:31:12.08 On the inside, you don't feel normal face.
01:31:12.08 --> 01:31:14.08 It doesn't look normal on the outside.
01:31:14.08 --> 01:31:16.08 It looks pretty evident what's happening.
01:31:16.08 --> 01:31:18.08 Well, I don't know.
01:31:18.08 --> 01:31:20.08 Yeah, at the end of the day, it's sort of just crept in.
01:31:20.08 --> 01:31:30.08 And yeah, I didn't, like, maintain the composure that I think is required to function at a, you know, at a better level than I did today.
01:31:30.08 --> 01:31:31.08 Put it that way.
01:31:31.08 --> 01:31:34.08 And the thing is, right when the timer goes off when we're done,
01:31:34.08 --> 01:31:37.08 it's like, it's like a avalanche of like,
01:31:37.08 --> 01:31:39.08 She's elective.
01:31:39.08 --> 01:31:40.08 It's not shame.
01:31:40.08 --> 01:31:42.08 I always think it's all part of the process.
01:31:42.08 --> 01:31:45.08 No matter how long and painful the process is.
01:31:45.08 --> 01:31:52.08 Did you come in today with, with a good positive attitude on the, what the outcome was going to be?
01:31:52.08 --> 01:31:52.08 Yeah.
01:31:52.08 --> 01:31:53.08 Do you feel good today?
01:31:53.08 --> 01:31:54.08 Yes.
01:31:54.08 --> 01:32:00.08 So, and it, just to be accurate, like, I don't, we always joke about this, but I don't come in thinking
01:32:00.08 --> 01:32:05.08 you're, can you just do it?
01:32:05.08 --> 01:32:06.08 Yeah, you're not positive.
01:32:06.08 --> 01:32:07.08 Are you sure about that?
01:32:07.08 --> 01:32:08.08 I don't think of that.
01:32:08.08 --> 01:32:12.08 I know for a fact there's been days where you've come in, you, I can see it in your eyes.
01:32:12.08 --> 01:32:14.08 You're thinking, I can do this today.
01:32:14.08 --> 01:32:17.08 Well, not be, well, right?
01:32:17.08 --> 01:32:19.08 I do think that yes, I can do this.
01:32:19.08 --> 01:32:23.08 But it's not up and you kind of sometimes you bow up out of fear.
01:32:23.08 --> 01:32:26.08 You just trying to convince yourself, you're trying to be like a peacock, right?
01:32:26.08 --> 01:32:27.08 Sometimes that happens.
01:32:27.08 --> 01:32:28.08 That's cool.
01:32:28.08 --> 01:32:30.08 I don't hold it against you. I just accept it.
01:32:30.08 --> 01:32:33.08 But sometimes you actually think like today's the big day.
01:32:33.08 --> 01:32:36.08 And when I see that look, yeah, I think, okay.
01:32:36.08 --> 01:32:40.08 Well, it's not about, like, okay, I'm going to like beat up, Joc.
01:32:40.08 --> 01:32:41.08 It's not that.
01:32:41.08 --> 01:32:44.08 It's more that, like I have a handful of things.
01:32:44.08 --> 01:32:47.08 The handful is all you need to do is capitalize on one mistake.
01:32:47.08 --> 01:32:48.08 Yeah.
01:32:48.08 --> 01:32:49.08 That's all that it is.
01:32:49.08 --> 01:32:49.08 Yeah.
01:32:49.08 --> 01:32:52.08 You can just play the numbers game now, you know?
01:32:52.08 --> 01:32:54.08 You're, you're good enough at your jutsu now.
01:32:54.08 --> 01:32:56.08 If I make a mistake, you can capitalize on it.
01:32:56.08 --> 01:32:58.08 You can just, you can just play the odds.
01:32:58.08 --> 01:33:01.08 I can beat you 100 times and I can beat you 100 times,
01:33:01.08 --> 01:33:02.08 or I can tap you out.
01:33:02.08 --> 01:33:04.08 No, we don't even care.
01:33:04.08 --> 01:33:06.08 It doesn't even, it doesn't even mean anything.
01:33:06.08 --> 01:33:09.08 You roll the dice one time and you get snake eyes.
01:33:09.08 --> 01:33:10.08 You get the big win.
01:33:10.08 --> 01:33:11.08 Yeah.
01:33:11.08 --> 01:33:12.08 That's where it's at.
01:33:12.08 --> 01:33:14.08 Yeah, it'd be at 7 or 11, but yeah, well, sorry.
01:33:14.08 --> 01:33:15.08 So, done not all good.
01:33:15.08 --> 01:33:17.08 Yeah, it's like an insurgent situation for sure.
01:33:17.08 --> 01:33:22.08 Yeah, yeah, you can smash me all you want, but it'll get you one time and never stay.
01:33:22.08 --> 01:33:23.08 Yeah.
01:33:23.08 --> 01:33:26.08 And it's normally not, like, I'm not necessarily trying to get it.
01:33:26.08 --> 01:33:28.08 Actually, most of the time, pretty much all the time,
01:33:28.08 --> 01:33:32.08 I'm not trying to, like, the goal is never to tap anyone out today.
01:33:32.08 --> 01:33:37.08 It's not that it's like to, to practice new things that I feel like I'm getting a hold of.
01:33:37.08 --> 01:33:38.08 Okay.
01:33:38.08 --> 01:33:40.08 Again, certain levels of people.
01:33:40.08 --> 01:33:42.08 And then, so you're not trying to tap me out.
01:33:42.08 --> 01:33:46.08 Well, that, of course I am, but that's not like the goal for that day.
01:33:46.08 --> 01:33:47.08 You know, it's kind of thing.
01:33:47.08 --> 01:33:52.08 It's more like, okay, I'm going to put together this, like, defense and combine with this little thing and whatever.
01:33:52.08 --> 01:33:56.08 And for you, it's real specific because it's like rolling with you isn't like this,
01:33:56.08 --> 01:33:58.08 it's like, very specific scenario.
01:33:58.08 --> 01:34:02.08 And which includes the psychological part.
01:34:02.08 --> 01:34:02.08 Yeah.
01:34:02.08 --> 01:34:10.08 And that's why I noticed a psychological devastation that you sort of had today is because after the time the time went off we're done,
01:34:10.08 --> 01:34:15.08 it all came to me like, man, you just got destroyed psychologically so bad.
01:34:15.08 --> 01:34:19.08 That goal is that you had for that specific role and for all roles with chocolate today.
01:34:19.08 --> 01:34:22.08 Like literally didn't have anything to do with the role that you just did.
01:34:22.08 --> 01:34:23.08 I don't go right now.
01:34:23.08 --> 01:34:28.08 Because of like your whole mindset, you know, and it was all because of stuff you're doing.
01:34:28.08 --> 01:34:31.08 And here's the kind of the dichotomy of it.
01:34:31.08 --> 01:34:33.08 It's like super fun when it happens.
01:34:33.08 --> 01:34:37.08 But because it's like the frustration is like pushing you know,
01:34:37.08 --> 01:34:41.08 but then it's like at the end of the day, it's all just one big game, you know.
01:34:41.08 --> 01:34:45.08 But it, it, there's a legitimate amount of frustration in there.
01:34:45.08 --> 01:34:49.08 It's funny because I can see that dichotomy in your face.
01:34:49.08 --> 01:34:52.08 Like I can tell that you're mad, but I can also tell that it's fun.
01:34:52.08 --> 01:34:54.08 You know, but you do get frustrated.
01:34:54.08 --> 01:35:00.08 Yeah, but sometimes you get legitimately like, like you make noises.
01:35:00.08 --> 01:35:03.08 Like frustration like groans or grouse.
01:35:03.08 --> 01:35:04.08 You know what I mean?
01:35:04.08 --> 01:35:08.08 Yeah, but it's like at, you know how like when then you know what else you'll do?
01:35:08.08 --> 01:35:10.08 Let's go again right now.
01:35:10.08 --> 01:35:12.08 Right? Like a little kid. Like a six year old.
01:35:12.08 --> 01:35:16.08 I know real, but the thing is like for a, and I say from the outside,
01:35:16.08 --> 01:35:18.08 I can see how that could, you know what I don't like.
01:35:18.08 --> 01:35:19.08 You know what I don't like.
01:35:19.08 --> 01:35:23.08 You know what I don't like is when I tap someone out.
01:35:23.08 --> 01:35:28.08 Let's say I'm in, I'm in a half guard and I tap someone out with something.
01:35:28.08 --> 01:35:30.08 And I let go.
01:35:30.08 --> 01:35:34.08 And then they're like, then they want to keep going like, as if that just didn't happen.
01:35:34.08 --> 01:35:35.08 Oh, from that exact position.
01:35:35.08 --> 01:35:37.08 You know, like that to me today.
01:35:37.08 --> 01:35:40.08 Yeah. And I was like, I mean, it's not, it's not like it's a big deal.
01:35:40.08 --> 01:35:46.08 But I was, I then I'm like, okay, because you know, I mean, I did whatever move I did.
01:35:46.08 --> 01:35:50.08 And then I let go, you tap and then I let go of it.
01:35:50.08 --> 01:35:51.08 Right.
01:35:51.08 --> 01:35:53.08 And then it's like, we'll just keep going.
01:35:53.08 --> 01:35:54.08 Yeah.
01:35:54.08 --> 01:35:56.08 And I'm like, what, what, why would we keep going?
01:35:56.08 --> 01:35:58.08 You just, you just submitted.
01:35:58.08 --> 01:35:59.08 Yeah.
01:35:59.08 --> 01:36:02.08 And there's other, the other thing is sometimes people,
01:36:02.08 --> 01:36:05.08 I think you've done this to me like maybe 10 times.
01:36:05.08 --> 01:36:08.08 No, maybe five times where you tap.
01:36:08.08 --> 01:36:11.08 And then like, I let go. And then you like come at me.
01:36:11.08 --> 01:36:14.08 Like you like you like double leg or whatever you like grab.
01:36:14.08 --> 01:36:15.08 And you try it.
01:36:15.08 --> 01:36:17.08 You know, and that's another one.
01:36:17.08 --> 01:36:18.08 I'm like, okay.
01:36:18.08 --> 01:36:18.08 Yeah.
01:36:18.08 --> 01:36:20.08 I see where I see how this is going.
01:36:20.08 --> 01:36:22.08 And I think you're doing that out of frustration.
01:36:22.08 --> 01:36:22.08 Yeah.
01:36:22.08 --> 01:36:23.08 Taurus chili.
01:36:23.08 --> 01:36:28.08 Partially out of like, you understand sometimes you want to learn what just happened, right?
01:36:28.08 --> 01:36:30.08 Like he put me back in that position.
01:36:30.08 --> 01:36:30.08 Yes.
01:36:30.08 --> 01:36:31.08 Cool.
01:36:31.08 --> 01:36:32.08 Yeah.
01:36:32.08 --> 01:36:33.08 I get that part too.
01:36:33.08 --> 01:36:35.08 And even that kind of bothers me again.
01:36:35.08 --> 01:36:39.08 But I could see, you know what, though, from an offensive standpoint,
01:36:39.08 --> 01:36:42.08 like from your position and someone's like, okay, we start from there.
01:36:42.08 --> 01:36:46.08 It's kind of like, you know the, it's like, not linear,
01:36:46.08 --> 01:36:51.08 but you know the path of, like, from start to finish that whole path is like a big
01:36:51.08 --> 01:36:56.08 creative learning battle fight twins losses like a, it's a whole path.
01:36:56.08 --> 01:37:01.08 I think that's why it bothers me because I like that whole thing.
01:37:01.08 --> 01:37:01.08 Yeah.
01:37:01.08 --> 01:37:03.08 And I completed that whole thing.
01:37:03.08 --> 01:37:04.08 Yeah.
01:37:04.08 --> 01:37:05.08 Yeah.
01:37:05.08 --> 01:37:07.08 That whole thing of, because let's face it.
01:37:07.08 --> 01:37:08.08 It's a big.
01:37:08.08 --> 01:37:10.08 There's a lot of things that go on.
01:37:10.08 --> 01:37:15.08 There's a lot of things that happen from from, we start rolling or you start rolling with someone
01:37:15.08 --> 01:37:17.08 to someone submits.
01:37:17.08 --> 01:37:18.08 There's all kinds of things.
01:37:18.08 --> 01:37:20.08 Especially you're starting standing.
01:37:20.08 --> 01:37:21.08 You got to take down a contend with.
01:37:21.08 --> 01:37:22.08 You got guard passing.
01:37:22.08 --> 01:37:23.08 You got guard recovery.
01:37:23.08 --> 01:37:24.08 You got switch.
01:37:24.08 --> 01:37:27.08 Get all these things to get to this point where you can actually submit somebody.
01:37:27.08 --> 01:37:28.08 Yeah.
01:37:28.08 --> 01:37:32.08 And all of a sudden we're just going to skip 85% of that battle, which by the way,
01:37:32.08 --> 01:37:40.08 from my perspective, all that time, all that battle is I'm maneuvering the whole time.
01:37:40.08 --> 01:37:41.08 You know what I mean?
01:37:41.08 --> 01:37:42.08 Yeah.
01:37:42.08 --> 01:37:43.08 It's like a part of my game.
01:37:43.08 --> 01:37:46.08 It's all part of me getting that submission.
01:37:46.08 --> 01:37:48.08 Sommission doesn't start when I hit the mat.
01:37:48.08 --> 01:37:50.08 The submission, it starts before we shake hands.
01:37:50.08 --> 01:37:51.08 That whole.
01:37:51.08 --> 01:37:52.08 You know what I'm saying?
01:37:52.08 --> 01:37:53.08 Yeah.
01:37:53.08 --> 01:37:56.08 So when we skip a big chunk of the, I like that whole part of the battle.
01:37:56.08 --> 01:37:57.08 Yeah.
01:37:57.08 --> 01:37:59.08 So when we skip it, I just feel like, oh, that's kind of weird.
01:37:59.08 --> 01:38:00.08 Yeah.
01:38:00.08 --> 01:38:04.08 And I just jumped to the end of the good song that has the guitar solo.
01:38:04.08 --> 01:38:06.08 Like, no, you got to listen the whole song, man.
01:38:06.08 --> 01:38:07.08 Yeah.
01:38:07.08 --> 01:38:08.08 I appreciate that thing.
01:38:08.08 --> 01:38:09.08 You're right.
01:38:09.08 --> 01:38:11.08 A good movie, right?
01:38:11.08 --> 01:38:14.08 Let's just skip to the scene where the battle takes place.
01:38:14.08 --> 01:38:15.08 You have you ever done that?
01:38:15.08 --> 01:38:16.08 You just watch the battle scene.
01:38:16.08 --> 01:38:18.08 It's not as good as when you watch the whole.
01:38:18.08 --> 01:38:18.08 Right.
01:38:18.08 --> 01:38:20.08 You're going to want to hear the whole.
01:38:20.08 --> 01:38:21.08 I want the whole build up to take place.
01:38:21.08 --> 01:38:22.08 Yeah.
01:38:22.08 --> 01:38:23.08 I just want to watch the battle scene.
01:38:23.08 --> 01:38:24.08 Yeah.
01:38:24.08 --> 01:38:25.08 That's actually, that's good.
01:38:25.08 --> 01:38:28.08 And I might actually glide that we kind of analyze it because,
01:38:28.08 --> 01:38:31.08 Yeah.
01:38:31.08 --> 01:38:32.08 Because it could be looked at.
01:38:32.08 --> 01:38:34.08 I always looked at it because I've done that.
01:38:34.08 --> 01:38:36.08 Like, I don't always do that.
01:38:36.08 --> 01:38:37.08 No, actually.
01:38:37.08 --> 01:38:39.08 You've done it probably five times.
01:38:39.08 --> 01:38:41.08 We've rolled thousands of times.
01:38:41.08 --> 01:38:42.08 Yeah.
01:38:42.08 --> 01:38:44.08 And it's like, okay, can we start from there kind of thing?
01:38:44.08 --> 01:38:46.08 And it's a little bit different.
01:38:46.08 --> 01:38:48.08 A little bit different is like, hey, can you just,
01:38:48.08 --> 01:38:50.08 wait, put that back on me?
01:38:50.08 --> 01:38:52.08 Let me see if I could get out.
01:38:52.08 --> 01:38:53.08 Okay, you got out cool now.
01:38:53.08 --> 01:38:54.08 We'll start again.
01:38:54.08 --> 01:38:55.08 Right.
01:38:55.08 --> 01:38:55.08 Right.
01:38:55.08 --> 01:38:56.08 Now, I'm not talking about that.
01:38:56.08 --> 01:38:57.08 Yeah.
01:38:57.08 --> 01:38:58.08 Yeah.
01:38:58.08 --> 01:38:59.08 Yeah.
01:38:59.08 --> 01:38:59.08 Yeah.
01:38:59.08 --> 01:39:00.08 Yeah.
01:39:00.08 --> 01:39:01.08 Yeah.
01:39:01.08 --> 01:39:02.08 Yeah.
01:39:02.08 --> 01:39:03.08 Yeah.
01:39:03.08 --> 01:39:03.08 Yeah.
01:39:03.08 --> 01:39:04.08 Yeah.
01:39:04.08 --> 01:39:05.08 That was made.
01:39:05.08 --> 01:39:06.08 And I've done that before.
01:39:06.08 --> 01:39:07.08 Really rarely.
01:39:07.08 --> 01:39:08.08 But I looked at it as shoot.
01:39:08.08 --> 01:39:09.08 That was like a plot.
01:39:09.08 --> 01:39:11.08 Like, I made a legitimate mistake right there.
01:39:11.08 --> 01:39:14.08 Let me like get back in that mindset and continue actually rolling.
01:39:14.08 --> 01:39:16.08 I think that's part of what bothers me.
01:39:16.08 --> 01:39:17.08 Yeah.
01:39:17.08 --> 01:39:18.08 It's not up to me.
01:39:18.08 --> 01:39:20.08 I think part of what bothers me is I think to myself.
01:39:20.08 --> 01:39:22.08 Oh, you just made this little mistake.
01:39:22.08 --> 01:39:23.08 And it was kind of a flu.
01:39:23.08 --> 01:39:24.08 Right.
01:39:24.08 --> 01:39:26.08 That's what you're implying is like, oh, this is just a little flu.
01:39:26.08 --> 01:39:28.08 And it's like, you're lucky that won't happen again.
01:39:28.08 --> 01:39:29.08 Yeah.
01:39:29.08 --> 01:39:32.08 That's like, sometimes people get mad when I submit them.
01:39:32.08 --> 01:39:34.08 Not very rarely.
01:39:34.08 --> 01:39:39.08 And I'm always like, man, is that much of an insult that I just sat to.
01:39:39.08 --> 01:39:40.08 You know what I mean?
01:39:40.08 --> 01:39:41.08 Yeah.
01:39:41.08 --> 01:39:42.08 Like, I'm not.
01:39:42.08 --> 01:39:43.08 When somebody taps me on, I'm not mad at them.
01:39:43.08 --> 01:39:44.08 Oh.
01:39:44.08 --> 01:39:45.08 I'm like, dang.
01:39:45.08 --> 01:39:46.08 Nice job.
01:39:46.08 --> 01:39:47.08 That was awesome.
01:39:47.08 --> 01:39:48.08 Good job.
01:39:48.08 --> 01:39:49.08 Yeah.
01:39:49.08 --> 01:39:50.08 But yeah.
01:39:50.08 --> 01:39:51.08 I think people are mean anyway.
01:39:51.08 --> 01:39:53.08 It's like any time when we get like anything's out of frustration.
01:39:53.08 --> 01:40:00.08 It's literally like maybe a 30% frustration, 70% you're just a guy that can take that kind of abuse.
01:40:00.08 --> 01:40:03.08 You know, like, if you're like, okay, good, you know, you got me out.
01:40:03.08 --> 01:40:05.08 And then you turn your back to reset.
01:40:05.08 --> 01:40:08.08 And yeah, jump on your back or take it on whatever.
01:40:08.08 --> 01:40:10.08 Like you can do that normally.
01:40:10.08 --> 01:40:11.08 Yeah.
01:40:11.08 --> 01:40:11.08 Yeah.
01:40:11.08 --> 01:40:11.08 Yeah.
01:40:11.08 --> 01:40:12.08 No.
01:40:12.08 --> 01:40:13.08 And even when you do it to me, it's not like you.
01:40:13.08 --> 01:40:17.08 You haven't ever like jumped and like put a rear-note could choke on or something like that.
01:40:17.08 --> 01:40:18.08 Yeah.
01:40:18.08 --> 01:40:22.08 You've kind of jumped into a slightly advantageous, but normal position for us to be in.
01:40:22.08 --> 01:40:23.08 Yeah.
01:40:23.08 --> 01:40:24.08 Which is no big deal.
01:40:24.08 --> 01:40:24.08 Yeah.
01:40:24.08 --> 01:40:26.08 You have taken my back a couple times.
01:40:26.08 --> 01:40:27.08 Yeah.
01:40:27.08 --> 01:40:32.08 But and then even then like, bro, we've been in this thing for long time where it's.
01:40:32.08 --> 01:40:33.08 Let's say I got it.
01:40:33.08 --> 01:40:35.08 Maybe that might, would that even bother you?
01:40:35.08 --> 01:40:37.08 Let's say I jump on your back in one of those situations.
01:40:37.08 --> 01:40:38.08 Then I got the rear-note get you.
01:40:38.08 --> 01:40:39.08 Yeah.
01:40:39.08 --> 01:40:40.08 And I finished it.
01:40:40.08 --> 01:40:43.08 You, well, I would kind of be like, well, we both know.
01:40:43.08 --> 01:40:44.08 You know, like, right?
01:40:44.08 --> 01:40:45.08 It's very catchy.
01:40:45.08 --> 01:40:46.08 Yeah.
01:40:46.08 --> 01:40:47.08 I took it down.
01:40:47.08 --> 01:40:48.08 Yeah.
01:40:48.08 --> 01:40:50.08 But real quick, back to the, uh, the path.
01:40:50.08 --> 01:40:55.08 You know, like, when you, when you want to, like, you double guy out any once to start from that same position or whatever.
01:40:55.08 --> 01:40:56.08 Yeah.
01:40:56.08 --> 01:41:01.08 If you look at that path, that whole path that is so, let's, this, this, that's a valuable path.
01:41:01.08 --> 01:41:03.08 Every path that you create.
01:41:03.08 --> 01:41:05.08 It's like learning and it's this big thing and it's fun.
01:41:05.08 --> 01:41:07.08 There's little competitiveness in there, whatever.
01:41:07.08 --> 01:41:11.08 And at the end, you finish each path as like this tree or whatever.
01:41:11.08 --> 01:41:12.08 It's done.
01:41:12.08 --> 01:41:15.08 You finish it with your submission when you win or when you lose.
01:41:15.08 --> 01:41:17.08 To entraining or even in competition.
01:41:17.08 --> 01:41:18.08 You win or you lose.
01:41:18.08 --> 01:41:26.08 You can't, like, after you win and complete your masterpiece path of wins and losing in a through the whole thing and you're done.
01:41:26.08 --> 01:41:29.08 That guy just can't step in and be like, no, it's not done.
01:41:29.08 --> 01:41:32.08 It's just sort of paused on my, like, right, you can't jump in and dictate that.
01:41:32.08 --> 01:41:35.08 So if you lost, rather than you've got to start all over and try to create something else.
01:41:35.08 --> 01:41:37.08 No, you know, try to do try new song.
01:41:37.08 --> 01:41:38.08 You can't just, oh, yeah.
01:41:38.08 --> 01:41:41.08 But at the same time.
01:41:41.08 --> 01:41:47.08 If you're looking at, like, training rolling as just practice, just training.
01:41:47.08 --> 01:41:48.08 Just, you know, whatever.
01:41:48.08 --> 01:41:49.08 And so, yeah.
01:41:49.08 --> 01:41:53.08 There's a big difference between, hey, we're going to actually practice right now.
01:41:53.08 --> 01:41:55.08 And we're going to roll.
01:41:55.08 --> 01:41:57.08 Yeah, because rolling is understood that is competitive.
01:41:57.08 --> 01:41:59.08 That's the whole reason it works so good.
01:41:59.08 --> 01:42:00.08 Yeah.
01:42:00.08 --> 01:42:01.08 It has to be competitive.
01:42:01.08 --> 01:42:03.08 So yes, that's why when you taught me out, I do consider it.
01:42:03.08 --> 01:42:05.08 No matter how much percentage, whatever.
01:42:05.08 --> 01:42:06.08 I do consider it.
01:42:06.08 --> 01:42:08.08 You beat me straight up in practice and training.
01:42:08.08 --> 01:42:12.08 You beat me because there's a significant amount of competition right there.
01:42:12.08 --> 01:42:16.08 So yeah, you can't be messing with the other guys wins and do that.
01:42:16.08 --> 01:42:17.08 Yeah.
01:42:17.08 --> 01:42:18.08 You're right.
01:42:18.08 --> 01:42:19.08 I can't, I'm never doing that ever again.
01:42:19.08 --> 01:42:20.08 If you want to do it, it's fine.
01:42:20.08 --> 01:42:21.08 I'm the same.
01:42:21.08 --> 01:42:22.08 It's not.
01:42:22.08 --> 01:42:23.08 It's not fine.
01:42:23.08 --> 01:42:24.08 I'm not doing it.
01:42:24.08 --> 01:42:25.08 I don't want to be that guy to do it, even.
01:42:25.08 --> 01:42:26.08 It's being that guy.
01:42:26.08 --> 01:42:30.08 Nonetheless, back to representing on Jockel's from Jockel's store.

01:47:10.08 --> 01:47:12.08 That's a book that you need.
01:47:12.08 --> 01:47:14.08 Or it's a book you can give.
01:47:14.08 --> 01:47:17.08 I'm super stoked when I meet people and they say,
01:47:17.08 --> 01:47:21.08 Yep, I've given 28 copies of the Disponucle freedom field menu
01:47:21.08 --> 01:47:24.08 or a way to other people and my family, other friends that I have.
01:47:24.08 --> 01:47:31.08 I, because it will help people get on the path and live a better life.
01:47:31.08 --> 01:47:32.08 That's a powerful thing.
01:47:32.08 --> 01:47:35.08 If you can actually help someone live a better life,
01:47:35.08 --> 01:47:37.08 there's a manual on how to live your life.
01:47:37.08 --> 01:47:40.08 It's called the Disponucle Freedom Field Manual.
01:47:40.08 --> 01:47:42.08 It's not a normal book.
01:47:42.08 --> 01:47:44.08 It's not normal.
01:47:44.08 --> 01:47:47.08 My publisher, when he was publishing it,
01:47:47.08 --> 01:47:51.08 he said this book is the biggest risk that he has ever taken
01:47:51.08 --> 01:47:53.08 in his publishing career.
01:47:53.08 --> 01:47:59.08 And he also said, and we're actually my agent told me once the book came out.
01:47:59.08 --> 01:48:07.08 The book sold more than any scenario that they had predicted for the book.
01:48:07.08 --> 01:48:09.08 So they, you know, they do these predictions.
01:48:09.08 --> 01:48:11.08 If it sells, it sells, it sells, it sells, it sells, it sells,
01:48:11.08 --> 01:48:12.08 it sells, it sells, the other thing.
01:48:12.08 --> 01:48:16.08 There's something called 100% cell through rate,
01:48:16.08 --> 01:48:20.08 which means every single book that got shipped got sold.
01:48:20.08 --> 01:48:23.08 It does not happen. And then they're back ordered and had to make more.
01:48:23.08 --> 01:48:26.08 Now the book is still selling like that.
01:48:26.08 --> 01:48:29.08 Disponucle Freedom Field Manual.
01:48:29.08 --> 01:48:30.08 Why does it keep selling?
01:48:30.08 --> 01:48:32.08 Because people read it and they get it for people they know.
01:48:32.08 --> 01:48:33.08 So check it out.
01:48:33.08 --> 01:48:38.08 It is the manual telling you how to get on the path and stay on the path.
01:48:38.08 --> 01:48:41.08 The audio version of that book is not on audible.
01:48:41.08 --> 01:48:42.08 It's on iTunes.
01:48:42.08 --> 01:48:43.08 It's on Amazon.
01:48:43.08 --> 01:48:46.08 Music, it's on Google Play and other MP3 platforms.
01:48:46.08 --> 01:48:48.08 Of course, there is extreme ownership.
01:48:48.08 --> 01:48:57.08 The first book that I wrote with my brother, Dave Babin, about the combat leadership principles that we learn on the battlefield and how you can apply them to your business and life.
01:48:57.08 --> 01:49:02.08 And we followed that book up with the book called the dichotomy and leadership, which,
01:49:02.08 --> 01:49:06.08 well, some people are saying, it's better than extreme ownership.
01:49:06.08 --> 01:49:08.08 Read it, judge for yourself.
01:49:08.08 --> 01:49:10.08 Tell us what you think.
01:49:10.08 --> 01:49:14.08 I think if you read extreme ownership,
01:49:14.08 --> 01:49:18.08 when you read dichotomy, a lot of things are going to fall into place.
01:49:18.08 --> 01:49:23.08 A lot of little things that you didn't quite have at the way you wanted it to be.
01:49:23.08 --> 01:49:25.08 When you read dichotomy, it's going to come into place.
01:49:25.08 --> 01:49:28.08 Also, we got echelon front, which is our leadership consultancy.
01:49:28.08 --> 01:49:30.08 We solved problems through leadership.
01:49:30.08 --> 01:49:31.08 That's what we do.
01:49:31.08 --> 01:49:36.08 It's me, Dave Babin, JP, to now Dave Burke, Flynn, Cochran, Mike Surrely, Mike Bima.
01:49:36.08 --> 01:49:43.08 And our latest addition to the team, Master Chief Seal, retired Jason Gardner.
01:49:43.08 --> 01:49:47.08 And our new student, Asheline, from dot com, if you want us to come work with your company, the
01:49:47.08 --> 01:49:52.08 Master, we got three masters this year.
01:49:52.08 --> 01:49:56.08 All masters ever have sold out.
01:49:56.08 --> 01:49:59.08 These are going to sell out well, as well.
01:49:59.08 --> 01:50:05.08 There's May 23rd and 24th in Chicago, September 19th and 20th in Denver.

01:50:16.08 --> 01:50:21.08 I had friends, friends that said, hey, you know, I didn't really sign up.
01:50:21.08 --> 01:50:23.08 Can you just give me a couple tickets?
01:50:23.08 --> 01:50:26.08 And I'm like, actually, no, I can't.
01:50:26.08 --> 01:50:29.08 Because we can't fit any more people in the building.
01:50:29.08 --> 01:50:31.08 So no.
01:50:31.08 --> 01:50:36.08 So I can't help you if you wait too long.

01:51:37.08 --> 01:51:41.08 You might think, well, I've got to hire somebody that's experienced in this industry.
01:51:41.08 --> 01:51:42.08 That's a good thought.
01:51:42.08 --> 01:51:44.08 I understand where you're coming from.
01:51:44.08 --> 01:51:50.08 What I recommend to you try is instead of hiring a person that has experienced in the industry
01:51:50.08 --> 01:51:55.08 have hired somebody that has experienced in something more important that is leadership.
01:51:55.08 --> 01:52:00.08 You can teach them and they can learn very quickly the industry that you're bringing them into.
01:52:00.08 --> 01:52:07.08 What you can't teach someone and when you can't give them is 20 years, 25 years, 22 years of leadership experience
01:52:07.08 --> 01:52:15.08 in the most high stakes business there is and that is war.
01:52:15.08 --> 01:52:17.08 So go to EF Overwatch.com.
01:52:17.08 --> 01:52:28.08 If you want to hire someone like that or if you are in that position of your vet and you want to look to get placed into a company.
01:52:28.08 --> 01:52:32.08 That's looking for leadership. EF Overwatch.com.
01:52:32.08 --> 01:52:43.08 And if you want to spend even more time with Echo Charles and myself because for some reason you think 500 hours of podcast isn't enough for you.
01:52:43.08 --> 01:52:50.08 We are out there. We are lurking on the inner webs on Twitter, on Instagram and on Facebook.
01:52:50.08 --> 01:52:52.08 Bookie.
01:52:52.08 --> 01:53:01.08 Moja. Echo is at Echo Charles and I am at Jocca Willink and thanks to all the people in uniform for your service.
01:53:01.08 --> 01:53:03.08 That's our military personnel.
01:53:03.08 --> 01:53:13.08 Also our police and law enforcement correction officers, border patrols, all first responders and tonight especially the firefighters,
01:53:13.08 --> 01:53:22.08 which is Paramedics EMTs who face suffering and death on a daily basis and they learn how to handle it.
01:53:22.08 --> 01:53:26.08 They learn how to stay balanced. They learn how to detach but not too much.
01:53:26.08 --> 01:53:37.08 Thanks for all of you for providing us the freedom and security that we enjoy every day and to everyone else that's listening.
01:53:37.08 --> 01:53:46.08 You have ideas and dreams and you have vision and that's cool.
01:53:46.08 --> 01:53:47.08 That's awesome.
01:53:47.08 --> 01:53:53.08 But none of that means anything unless you execute.
01:53:53.08 --> 01:53:59.08 So execute, move forward, take action and you know what, maybe your idea works, maybe it doesn't.
01:53:59.08 --> 01:54:06.08 And if it doesn't and try another one and maybe none of them will ever work and that's fine because in the end
01:54:06.08 --> 01:54:15.08 at a minimum you know at least you went out there and got after it.
01:54:15.08 --> 01:54:39.08 So until next time, this is Echo and Jocco out.
