Well, then I got a call from Tom Richards and Tom's on the ground and he said, when you're flying over here, did you see, you know, I have to put your strike in, you want to put a strike in, I put a strike in, single ship, which is against squadron policy, single ships strike because, you know, but I had no choice, obviously that guy's on the ground and they were taken fire, we were taken fire on the way in and on the way up. Because you know the publishers like, well, you know, we don't want to invest too much in that to become, you know, it's like, okay, cool. So we always tried to put a solid co-pilot with a pilot maybe not all of the races, the bases like John, but some guys, there are some guys who were good guys, but they, you know, got didn't give them those skills. I said, well, we got, you got, you know, Jay to go Hoover and you got Jay Wallace LeProd. Well, it's like your family, you know, these guys know all your crap and they still like you. When you guys were there, you know, like when we, like my generation looks, looks at the Vietnam War and the late 60s or the 70s, you know, it's all this. And, and a couple of times they got sappers on the boat, but they got them to seals got them before they did damage. So I'm glad he took the, you know, took charge of it and came through and you know, talked to Helen and got this arranged and I've enjoyed the two hours that we've spent here with you. So, you know, we got 14 guys, I got a worry about of my own before I worry about four more. They actually got into the barges and got on some of those boats and got out to see. And I said, well, our reward is that there are six guys that got wounded and they survived and they got families and most of them. Next time she says something like that, I'll be like, well, you know, he does he is the assistant director on some of these videos. And, and so, but we ended up getting divorced later, but I always kidding say that my, I got up because my wife didn't like the Navy, but turned out she didn't like me. Didn't know this, but I don't know how they know, but supposedly the first sailor killed in the Pearl Harbor attack was from Gridley, California. You know, you know, so now we know I am, I am unemployed in the individual. yeah, I got, I got 1012 guys dead there and we, and what else you see? He had the swift boats and there wasn't a lot of coordination with the swift boats except when they got in trouble they call us up and scramble us for close air support when they got in the trouble. Got hit in the shoulder, radio man got hit in the right shoulder. But the story got kind of muffled over 50 years because we never got the debrief the op. We're going to go by boat, you know, with they've got a kid Carson scout. By the way, I know I said that one time, but the way I said it is indicating that it's not as big of a deal as it really is. I see good people doing good things being kind to each other and particularly young old man who they have got no reason to be kind to you. But we got, I got so low I couldn't go back at the time. You're in the Navy, the training and and the people who are selected to go, you know, you know, you were just quality people and they were, we're into those things. And you know, sour grapes, and you know, like I show up there. Because after Meridian, you got to go to Kingsville and Bville, and then you get your wings, and then you go to a rag, and it, you know, it's a long time. Meantime, I got a seal team on the ground, I got a escort to slick out and my wingman's missing. We got loaded, got Tom on board and off we went back again. Literally, like, these shorts are so worn out because they wear them every single day that, like, it has the outline for my cell phone, like, on the pocket of whatever. I was gone for two of those months and we got, they months later we got married. This is going to lead him in and tell Jensen says XYZ is here and they would let us know where they're going to be. and I said, I got to walk and do this saying, you know, to stay at You know, it's like these are things that are like when you're in the game on the path. And then what was the kind of on the job training procedure to get you guys where, you know, you start, you start off as a copilot every time. If ours got free food and booze, so we got a big tent for the top of the backyard and everything. You know, you got your job to do and it doesn't work unless you're doing your part of the job. You know, is that, you know, kind of think she understands. And I got one, a roll got one done and we, this no big deal. You never know when the call will come and you never know how much time you will have. And if you're doing that, like your whole day is good in my opinion, got some books. So we got all, we got transition to the aircraft, precision and acrobatics. And so, so, I got this, I got this thing. And when you roll in and put me hot, that means we know what we're going to do with Intervalometer, whether we're going to fly a pair, a pair or two pair. Hope you got the air speed before you got to the water. You got some close calls on the LSTs, you know, the same thing you'd barely hover. Most server got was like 200, but I was a little guy. And you know you're in bad days and good days and I'm going to tell a story.
