00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.74
This is Jockelpont Cas number 325.

2
00:00:02.74 --> 00:00:05.12
With echo trails and me, Jockel Willing.

3
00:00:05.12 --> 00:00:06.12
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:06.12 --> 00:00:07.12
Good evening.

5
00:00:07.12 --> 00:00:11.04
And also, joining us again tonight is Jason Gardner.

6
00:00:11.04 --> 00:00:12.04
Good evening, Jason.

7
00:00:12.04 --> 00:00:13.04
Good evening.

8
00:00:13.04 --> 00:00:26.64
Chicago Times Special Camp Robinson, Nebraska May 24th, 1877.

9
00:00:26.64 --> 00:00:33.72
Your correspondent has obtained some very valuable information in regard to the Custer massacre

10
00:00:33.72 --> 00:00:41.32
from crazy horse, through horned horse as his spokesman, which is authentic and confirmed

11
00:00:41.32 --> 00:00:44.64
by other principal chiefs.

12
00:00:44.64 --> 00:00:47.52
I interviewed the chiefs this afternoon.

13
00:00:47.52 --> 00:00:51.96
Lieutenant Clark arranging for the meeting in William Hunter acting as interpreter

14
00:00:51.96 --> 00:00:58.48
a man perfectly reliable and thoroughly converse in the Indian language.

15
00:00:58.48 --> 00:01:01.56
This is the Indian version and the first published.

16
00:01:01.56 --> 00:01:06.92
The attack was made on the village by a strong force at 11 o'clock in the morning at the

17
00:01:06.92 --> 00:01:10.28
upper end of the village.

18
00:01:10.28 --> 00:01:16.08
This was the force commanded by Major Reno and very shortly afterward the lower end of the

19
00:01:16.08 --> 00:01:21.92
village was attacked by another strong force that commanded by Custer.

20
00:01:21.92 --> 00:01:27.04
The village was divided into seven different bands of Indians each commanded by a separate

21
00:01:27.04 --> 00:01:32.16
chief and extended in nearly a straight line.

22
00:01:32.16 --> 00:01:40.56
The village consisted of 18 hundred lodges and at least 400 wicky ups, a lodge made of

23
00:01:40.56 --> 00:01:43.84
small poles and willows for temporary shelter.

24
00:01:43.84 --> 00:01:48.92
Each of the wicky ups contained four young bucks and the estimate made by crazy horses

25
00:01:48.92 --> 00:01:54.68
that each lodge had from three to four warriors.

26
00:01:54.68 --> 00:02:00.64
Estimating at three made a fighting force of seven thousand Indians.

27
00:02:00.64 --> 00:02:05.40
This is the lowest estimate that can be made for there were a good many Indians without

28
00:02:05.40 --> 00:02:12.68
shelter hangers on who fought when called upon and the usual number was much above seven

29
00:02:12.68 --> 00:02:14.68
thousand.

30
00:02:14.68 --> 00:02:21.56
The attack was a surprise and totally unlipped for when Custer made the charge the women

31
00:02:21.56 --> 00:02:27.48
proposes children and in fact all that were not fighters made a stampede in an orderly

32
00:02:27.48 --> 00:02:29.24
direction.

33
00:02:29.24 --> 00:02:33.48
Custer seemed so numerous about a mistook them for the main body of Indians retreating

34
00:02:33.48 --> 00:02:37.92
and abandoning their villages and immediately gave pursuit.

35
00:02:37.92 --> 00:02:42.36
The warriors in the village seeing this divided their forces into two parts.

36
00:02:42.36 --> 00:02:47.96
One intercepting Custer between their non-combatants and him and the other getting his in his

37
00:02:47.96 --> 00:02:49.84
rear.

38
00:02:49.84 --> 00:02:58.68
Outnumbering him as they did they had him at their mercy and the dreadful massacre ensued.

39
00:02:58.68 --> 00:03:04.32
Horned horse says the smoke and dust were so great that folk could not be distinguished

40
00:03:04.32 --> 00:03:05.32
from friend.

41
00:03:05.32 --> 00:03:08.24
The horses were wild with fright and uncontrollable.

42
00:03:08.24 --> 00:03:12.16
The Indians were knocking each other from their steeds and it is an absolute fact

43
00:03:12.16 --> 00:03:17.36
that several young bucks in their excitement and fury killed each other, several dead Indians

44
00:03:17.36 --> 00:03:20.92
being found killed by arrows.

45
00:03:20.92 --> 00:03:26.72
Horned horse represented this hell of fire and smoke and death by intertwining his fingers

46
00:03:26.72 --> 00:03:33.08
and saying just like this Indians and white men.

47
00:03:33.08 --> 00:03:38.84
These chiefs say they suffered a loss of 58 killed and over 60 wounded.

48
00:03:38.84 --> 00:03:45.72
And their way of expressing it I should judge that about 60% of their wounded died.

49
00:03:45.72 --> 00:03:50.04
While this butcher he was going on, Reno was fighting in the upper part of the village but

50
00:03:50.04 --> 00:03:56.96
did not get in so far as to get surrounded and manage to escape.

51
00:03:56.96 --> 00:04:02.84
They say had he got in his far, he would have suffered the same fate as Custer but he

52
00:04:02.84 --> 00:04:08.48
retreated to the Bluffs and was held there until Indians fighting Custer.

53
00:04:08.48 --> 00:04:15.60
Rising over half the village could join the northern portion in besieging him.

54
00:04:15.60 --> 00:04:21.28
These Indians claim that but for the time the arrival of General Terry they would have

55
00:04:21.28 --> 00:04:23.56
certainly got Reno.

56
00:04:23.56 --> 00:04:29.68
They would have surrounded and stormed him out or would have besieged and eventually captured

57
00:04:29.68 --> 00:04:31.60
him.

58
00:04:31.60 --> 00:04:37.96
From what I know of crazy horse I should say that he no doubt is capable of conducting a siege.

59
00:04:37.96 --> 00:04:46.000
In both the Rose Bud fight and the Custer massacre the Indians claim that crazy horse

60
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.36
rode unarmed in the thickest of the fight invoking the blessing of the great spirit on

61
00:04:51.36 --> 00:05:05.60
himself that if he was right he might be victorious and if wrong that he might be killed.

62
00:05:05.60 --> 00:05:12.40
So that right there is an excerpt from a book called I fought with Custer which we covered

63
00:05:12.40 --> 00:05:16.44
on this podcast podcast number 48.

64
00:05:16.44 --> 00:05:21.64
You might want to go check that one out and that's from a section that we actually didn't

65
00:05:21.64 --> 00:05:23.64
cover on the podcast.

66
00:05:23.64 --> 00:05:27.60
The section of the book that's called They fought against Custer and it's got a bunch

67
00:05:27.60 --> 00:05:35.44
of firsthand accounts from the Indians that fought against Custer.

68
00:05:35.44 --> 00:05:41.20
And I didn't cover that section because we had already covered the Native American perspective

69
00:05:41.20 --> 00:05:50.12
in podcast 45 where we discussed the book called Wooden Leg who was a northern Cheyenne

70
00:05:50.12 --> 00:05:55.88
Indian who fought against Custer at Little Big Horn.

71
00:05:55.88 --> 00:05:58.76
And that's a good podcast to listen to.

72
00:05:58.76 --> 00:06:04.04
I've got quite a few seal friends that that's one of their favorite podcasts.

73
00:06:04.04 --> 00:06:12.28
But this man that gets mentioned here this warrior he's mentioned in both those books.

74
00:06:12.28 --> 00:06:19.80
And he's mentioned pretty quickly in both the books but he's someone that is definitely

75
00:06:19.80 --> 00:06:27.28
worth exploring as a warrior as a man and as a leader and Jason you sent me a great

76
00:06:27.28 --> 00:06:30.28
book while back called the Journey of Crazy Horse.

77
00:06:30.28 --> 00:06:38.32
This book is written by a guy named Joseph M. Marshall the third who himself is a member

78
00:06:38.32 --> 00:06:39.80
of the Lakota tribe.

79
00:06:39.80 --> 00:06:49.62
He was raised on the Rosebud Indian reservation in South Dakota and he kind of reports

80
00:06:49.62 --> 00:06:58.28
on or explores his journey of discovering and understanding crazy horse and starts off

81
00:06:58.28 --> 00:07:08.52
with a certain image of crazy horse and then learns more about him over time.

82
00:07:08.52 --> 00:07:16.68
Kind of going from a legend held aloft sort of above being human to being a warrior to being

83
00:07:16.68 --> 00:07:21.40
a leader and then ultimately understanding him as a man.

84
00:07:21.40 --> 00:07:25.52
And much of what he's you know I always like to do the first person accounting that's

85
00:07:25.52 --> 00:07:36.28
what I'm always trying to get for the podcast and this much of what Joseph talks about.

86
00:07:36.28 --> 00:07:41.24
Joseph Marshall talks about is stuff that was passed to him through his elders through

87
00:07:41.24 --> 00:07:49.92
oral history and that's I think what allows this book to come to life so well so guess

88
00:07:49.92 --> 00:08:00.44
we dive into the journey of the journey of crazy horse by Joseph M. Marshall the third.

89
00:08:00.44 --> 00:08:01.84
Where did you find this book originally?

90
00:08:01.84 --> 00:08:09.84
So I got a buddy that lives in Iowa, Chris Anderson and he sent me this book to read

91
00:08:09.84 --> 00:08:11.80
it was like how you need to check this out.

92
00:08:11.80 --> 00:08:19.32
So about two years ago I knocked it out on audible and then as we started to do the you

93
00:08:19.32 --> 00:08:23.48
know we're doing the battlefield a little big one you know I'm like well I want to understand

94
00:08:23.48 --> 00:08:28.36
more about the for everything that cost her did wrong there's stuff that's sitting

95
00:08:28.36 --> 00:08:33.40
born crazy horse we're doing right now I want to try to understand more that so I hit

96
00:08:33.40 --> 00:08:37.40
this book up and then it made sense for something that we could talk about here especially

97
00:08:37.40 --> 00:08:43.12
because it's from the Lakota perspective and brought down from their oral history.

98
00:08:43.12 --> 00:08:48.32
Yeah the we're so the battlefield that you're talking about this is an event that we do

99
00:08:48.32 --> 00:08:52.40
at echelon front where we go and look at the we go and walk the battlefield and there's

100
00:08:52.40 --> 00:08:54.40
all these leaders to learn from.

101
00:08:54.40 --> 00:09:00.24
I mean we do get his bird and this would be the first one that the first series that we're

102
00:09:00.24 --> 00:09:03.32
going to do up at a little big horn.

103
00:09:03.32 --> 00:09:08.80
So going out there understanding the personalities of these individuals gives you so much

104
00:09:08.80 --> 00:09:13.84
more depth into understanding their leadership decisions and the decisions that they made

105
00:09:13.84 --> 00:09:20.64
you can start to identify how their personalities impacted their decisions and then you

106
00:09:20.64 --> 00:09:26.56
can look at yourself and say what part of my personality is impacting my decision and we

107
00:09:26.56 --> 00:09:32.08
I haven't been to live you've been a little big horn yet yeah I have same kind of spiritual

108
00:09:33.44 --> 00:09:39.20
impact as get his bird yes and it's incredible because you you can sit you can sit in the

109
00:09:39.20 --> 00:09:45.12
gully where Reno had hit they well they came across a came across river and attacked the south

110
00:09:45.12 --> 00:09:48.88
end of the camp because initially they could only see a portion of it and thought it was

111
00:09:48.88 --> 00:09:54.32
much smaller and then they'd the morons didn't listen to their crow scouts who said whoa that's

112
00:09:54.32 --> 00:10:01.36
a much bigger in cabin than you think it is and you you can see all these spots and and it's

113
00:10:01.36 --> 00:10:06.24
just it's it's it's it's it's it's really humbling to be able to see it and talk about it

114
00:10:06.24 --> 00:10:12.08
and discuss what's going on and and feel the energy it was there yeah I'm looking forward to

115
00:10:12.08 --> 00:10:17.36
what when we doing that August it's August yeah all right so let's get into this book

116
00:10:18.72 --> 00:10:24.000
here we go crazy horses been my hero since I was a boy he was arguably the best known

117
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.24
Lakota leader in the latter half of the 19th century a turbulent time on the northern plains

118
00:10:30.24 --> 00:10:34.08
at first I knew crazy horse only as a fighting man the warrior

119
00:10:34.08 --> 00:10:40.08
I didn't know or care what he felt what he thought I cared only that he was a Lakota

120
00:10:40.08 --> 00:10:43.92
and that he was brave and performed deeds that fired my imagination

121
00:10:45.28 --> 00:10:50.64
but it's time went on there were more stories I now know crazy horse as a man

122
00:10:51.84 --> 00:10:58.72
first and a legend second a very distant second in fact he is much like my father and my uncles

123
00:10:58.72 --> 00:11:05.20
and my all my grandfather's he walks straight he's polite and he speaks softly

124
00:11:06.80 --> 00:11:12.56
but there's also an aura of mystery about him as though sometimes I am seeing him in a

125
00:11:12.56 --> 00:11:18.16
mist that blends legend and reality it's that aura that seems to appeal to most people

126
00:11:18.16 --> 00:11:23.36
and I'm convinced that many want to connect with the mystery more than they want to identify

127
00:11:23.36 --> 00:11:29.28
with the man I can remember consciously hearing his name for the first time the summer I was six

128
00:11:29.28 --> 00:11:36.000
years old my grandfather Albert and a man I knew as grandpa Isaac and I had just crossed the

129
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.64
little white river and stopped arrest as they both fashion their role your own cigarettes one of

130
00:11:42.64 --> 00:11:50.48
them compared the slow the slow moving little white to the greasy grass river I learned later

131
00:11:50.48 --> 00:11:56.56
that the greasy grass was in south central Montana and was also known as a little big horn

132
00:11:57.84 --> 00:12:03.04
in the shade of a thick grove of sand bar willow the two old men spoke about a battle

133
00:12:03.84 --> 00:12:09.28
and names that I had never heard before or at least that I couldn't remember hearing before

134
00:12:09.28 --> 00:12:16.56
rolled off their tongues that day along the river one name was repeated more often than the

135
00:12:16.56 --> 00:12:24.32
others in the story of that battle the name his crazy horse he was a leader of fighting men

136
00:12:24.32 --> 00:12:29.52
and his mere appearance on the battlefield was apparently enough to inspire others to fight

137
00:12:30.40 --> 00:12:34.32
crazy horse had led a charge of warriors against the soldiers in the second engagement of that

138
00:12:34.32 --> 00:12:40.96
battle a leader commented on that particular action when recounting the battle years later by saying

139
00:12:40.96 --> 00:12:47.68
I have never seen anything so brave by the age of six I'd already listened to many stories from

140
00:12:47.68 --> 00:12:53.28
these two grandfather's I was well aware that being a fighting man was one way of being a man

141
00:12:53.28 --> 00:12:58.96
in the Lakota ways of old I knew that men were often injured or wounded in battle and sometimes

142
00:12:58.96 --> 00:13:06.24
killed and I knew that in a battle a man could prove himself for one man to obviously evoke

143
00:13:06.24 --> 00:13:12.96
such reverence and respect from two grandfather's who told the story of 1876 greasy grass fight

144
00:13:12.96 --> 00:13:20.72
the battle of little big horn was of some consequence in my six year old world I could think of only

145
00:13:20.72 --> 00:13:26.80
two or three other old men in the same category as these two grandfather's so when they respected

146
00:13:26.80 --> 00:13:35.52
someone it was no small thing that day by the little white river crazy horse became a part of my life

147
00:13:42.72 --> 00:13:50.32
we were having this conversation I think yesterday this idea and I think I had brought it up

148
00:13:50.32 --> 00:13:57.36
on some other podcast but the idea that this if you're going to go out and fight

149
00:13:58.32 --> 00:14:05.12
is that programmed into us is that just what we're raised with that we think hey going out and fighting

150
00:14:05.12 --> 00:14:10.88
and being heroic being a warrior is a cool thing is a good thing or is there some sort of

151
00:14:11.68 --> 00:14:19.36
genetic component to it because as a human being in a group of other human beings that are trying to

152
00:14:19.36 --> 00:14:27.20
survive 10,000 years ago and we're part of a gang we're part of a tribe and if Jason is the kind

153
00:14:27.20 --> 00:14:36.000
of guy that goes out and kills a buffalo or defends our tribe then you help us all survive and so

154
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.96
we're naturally we naturally intuitively instinctively elevate the people that are ready to fight

155
00:14:42.96 --> 00:14:51.36
and we can't even control it I don't know what do you think yeah it's it's interesting because

156
00:14:51.36 --> 00:14:56.96
the good hunters also translate to their good warriors right but then in their society in

157
00:14:56.96 --> 00:15:05.04
the Lakota Society the medicine men were also revered as well so I guess people were elevated

158
00:15:05.04 --> 00:15:11.04
based on whatever they brought to the community with large and then oftentimes with either the

159
00:15:11.04 --> 00:15:17.12
medicine men or the warriors eventually you age out of it and then they're looking at you for

160
00:15:18.48 --> 00:15:28.32
for your wisdom you know like Chamberlain that guy comes over from like the intellectual

161
00:15:28.32 --> 00:15:32.08
side of the house because he's a college professor when he joins the army so it's kind of like

162
00:15:32.08 --> 00:15:37.12
he wasn't really that that's what makes him so interesting and so cool is he's like good at everything

163
00:15:37.12 --> 00:15:42.32
every side of the Rubik's Cube you examine with that guy he's square the solid colors yeah

164
00:15:43.92 --> 00:15:49.68
the thing is though you have all these different societies around the world that are some of them are totally

165
00:15:49.68 --> 00:15:56.64
disconnected from other societies and there's like always a warrior tradition yes it leads me to believe that

166
00:15:56.64 --> 00:16:04.96
at least at some level human beings look at the person that's ready to stand up and fight and defend

167
00:16:04.96 --> 00:16:13.12
and they have an instinctual inherent elevation elevated attitude towards that person here this

168
00:16:13.12 --> 00:16:17.52
guy is six years old you know I'm thinking and he's hearing these stories and thinks it's cool

169
00:16:18.56 --> 00:16:23.92
in the parlance of our time right like hey that's wow this sounds cool what was I doing when I was

170
00:16:24.56 --> 00:16:34.40
eight years old watching apocalypse now thinking that's cool that guy he special forces he's going on

171
00:16:34.40 --> 00:16:43.12
this mission up the river that's cool I don't know I mean my dad wasn't in the military there was

172
00:16:43.84 --> 00:16:50.48
no my grandfather was but he wasn't super influential in my life and all of the sudden as just instinct

173
00:16:51.68 --> 00:16:58.40
that looks cool it yeah because it doesn't appear to be generation leaving in this case crazy

174
00:16:58.40 --> 00:17:06.48
horses dad is a matter of fact he's not a fighter yeah um and so you know you look at how we

175
00:17:07.12 --> 00:17:14.16
revere sports figures and in a lot of ways their warriors you choose a sporting team and they're

176
00:17:14.16 --> 00:17:17.76
the ones that are going out and doing battle with other sporting teams or rooting for them and

177
00:17:17.76 --> 00:17:26.24
they're who are putting up on a pedestal for the most spot it it's not that different than

178
00:17:26.24 --> 00:17:32.64
then combat which who's going on it's an interesting thing to discuss feels like there's an

179
00:17:32.64 --> 00:17:38.80
element of risk there too like so skill and then risk and sacrifice that for everybody sacrifice for

180
00:17:38.80 --> 00:17:46.72
everybody else and they're they're lies in why we hold up like that courage as being a value that we

181
00:17:47.60 --> 00:17:53.52
or something that we value right is courage yeah like if you if you're a little

182
00:17:53.52 --> 00:17:58.56
say like I'm a six year old or whatever and you think of some guy who goes out and kills a buffalo

183
00:17:58.56 --> 00:18:03.68
and then brings it back or whatever you think man if I want to try to kill a buffalo and

184
00:18:03.68 --> 00:18:08.40
things in a kill me you know so he's like good at what he does he's risk dying and then when he

185
00:18:08.40 --> 00:18:13.20
brings it back it's for all of us he's like hero you know right so kind of it's I mean that's obviously

186
00:18:13.20 --> 00:18:17.36
like a metaphor or the the sporting teams and stuff that's a metaphor yeah that's a big

187
00:18:17.36 --> 00:18:23.12
but of the same thing though yeah exactly but I and I think this is so obvious what we're saying

188
00:18:23.12 --> 00:18:32.64
I ask my actual question is is it instinctual is it like part of our nature

189
00:18:33.76 --> 00:18:39.76
that we can you know it may or may not get you know expanded upon as we grow up in some people

190
00:18:39.76 --> 00:18:44.40
you know being a warrior stupid why would you go and sacrifice yourself for other people like

191
00:18:44.40 --> 00:18:52.72
that's unattitude so you can overcome this instinct but it is kind of crazy to think hey this is

192
00:18:52.72 --> 00:18:59.12
the way many different societies from all different background all kind of elevate this warrior

193
00:18:59.12 --> 00:19:06.16
is it an in isn't a natural animal instinct to think this person's going to protect the tribe

194
00:19:06.16 --> 00:19:09.76
this person's going to help the tribe this person's going to feed the tribe this person's possibly

195
00:19:09.76 --> 00:19:13.20
going to sacrifice for themselves for the tribe and that's a positive thing we're going to

196
00:19:13.20 --> 00:19:18.08
elevate them because they're putting the tribe before themselves they're putting themselves at

197
00:19:18.08 --> 00:19:23.60
risk in order to save the tribe and that's why it's very likely instinctual and

198
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.12
I don't I don't I don't I think that's no matter where you look if you examine closely

199
00:19:31.12 --> 00:19:41.12
that's still revered today this individual human overcame the the instinct of self preservation

200
00:19:41.12 --> 00:19:46.80
to look out for me and look out for my family we're going to elevate that individual

201
00:19:48.08 --> 00:19:54.48
all right going back to the book here every Lakota baby was born with thick shiny black hair

202
00:19:54.48 --> 00:19:59.84
that stayed black for most of adulthood but the hair of the son of crazy horse seemed to grow

203
00:19:59.84 --> 00:20:04.64
lighter even as he lost his baby fat which happened to him quicker than the most children

204
00:20:04.64 --> 00:20:09.04
to his mother and the other women in his life it was an endearing characteristic

205
00:20:09.04 --> 00:20:12.48
although they worried that it would prove to be troublesome for him later in life

206
00:20:13.36 --> 00:20:18.88
outside the reach of sharp ears he was referred to as the light-haired one

207
00:20:20.40 --> 00:20:29.68
to his face he was simply called Gigi or light hair so he's got a distinctive characteristic

208
00:20:29.68 --> 00:20:37.20
out of the gate which is also kind of interesting you know you got a my name is Joko which is

209
00:20:37.20 --> 00:20:40.88
a weird name and I've had that it's a nickname but it's been my nickname since I was born

210
00:20:40.88 --> 00:20:47.92
which meant when I met someone when I was five years old and seven years old and four years old

211
00:20:47.92 --> 00:20:54.96
and ten years old they would say what's your name and I had to say this weird name you know my

212
00:20:54.96 --> 00:20:59.60
name is Joko but that's I didn't really know that that was just a nickname it's all as a

213
00:20:59.60 --> 00:21:05.36
older so you kind of have to contend with this right it's kind of like oh you got to contend with this

214
00:21:05.36 --> 00:21:08.72
what happened in weird name you haven't weird name yes I know that did you know that yes

215
00:21:08.72 --> 00:21:14.40
there I did did you did you you feel that a little bit like when you were six years old yes

216
00:21:15.76 --> 00:21:20.80
you did now Jason was as hey I'm Jason good you have to spell it you know the mispronounce

217
00:21:20.80 --> 00:21:28.08
you're just good to go no so I think these kind of distinctive characteristic can sometimes help

218
00:21:28.88 --> 00:21:34.96
they can also sometimes I think hurt kids when you're young you got some weird like sometimes

219
00:21:34.96 --> 00:21:39.84
have to kids grow really tall quickly yeah and they don't they don't like it you know they feel like

220
00:21:39.84 --> 00:21:44.16
awkward or people are looking at them or when you get glasses right that's another thing maybe

221
00:21:44.16 --> 00:21:48.88
it's not that big of a deal when I was a kid like when someone had glasses they had to contend with

222
00:21:48.88 --> 00:21:53.92
that yeah to deal with it but they're tempering them it's making I mean that's the metaphor he uses

223
00:21:53.92 --> 00:22:00.24
in here that it the teasing temper's crazy horse to make him hard and it's a boy named Sue yes

224
00:22:00.24 --> 00:22:04.64
that's exactly what I was thinking about and his metaphor is like hanging the staff and the T.P. for

225
00:22:04.64 --> 00:22:10.72
five years to slowly temper it and make it harder and then you're going to carve that ass dive into a bow

226
00:22:13.28 --> 00:22:19.76
we were talking about buds earlier and amazed that they're still a huge attrition rate

227
00:22:19.76 --> 00:22:23.84
and our thoughts are it it's because a lot of the some of the folks that are there and are such

228
00:22:23.84 --> 00:22:29.68
good athletes that never failed anything whereas opposed when I got there and and I'd already

229
00:22:30.96 --> 00:22:35.52
failed it a bunch of stuff and I was used to getting beat up at getting knockdown and it's like

230
00:22:35.52 --> 00:22:40.56
I'm just gonna dust myself up and get moving again yeah you and I were saying that when they

231
00:22:40.56 --> 00:22:44.88
when the instructors looked at us and said you suck we were like yeah I know obviously

232
00:22:45.44 --> 00:22:52.96
but if you're like the star athlete and you get told you suck and you and then you lose the race

233
00:22:52.96 --> 00:22:57.20
because by the way because you're so athletic they make you do a bunch of jump squats before you do

234
00:22:57.20 --> 00:23:02.16
the sprint race and then you lose and then they call you loser and it's never happened before and

235
00:23:02.16 --> 00:23:08.40
all of a sudden you're like I this isn't for me I can't win in this arena or I'm not good enough

236
00:23:08.96 --> 00:23:15.12
and meanwhile you got Joe slightly below average athlete which is me just like well I'll keep going

237
00:23:15.12 --> 00:23:18.40
I suck yeah I know but I'm gonna keep going I'm used to this yeah yeah

238
00:23:18.40 --> 00:23:25.20
uh the other thing and he mentions in the book I'm not gonna highlight it but they called him

239
00:23:25.20 --> 00:23:31.12
the women decided to call him light hair to just get it over with it was like hey you know oh

240
00:23:31.44 --> 00:23:35.28
you got you look a little bit funky cool we're just gonna we're just gonna break make it

241
00:23:35.28 --> 00:23:40.64
where's gonna call you that just get it out in the open get the elephant yeah in the room out

242
00:23:41.28 --> 00:23:44.96
why not yeah isn't that what all the psychology does it's like oh you're afraid of elevator so

243
00:23:44.96 --> 00:23:48.56
let's make you look at a bunch of pictures elevators and eventually maybe you get in one

244
00:23:48.56 --> 00:23:53.84
and then late you just do graduated exposure and that's what they did here

245
00:23:53.84 --> 00:23:58.40
the students to work yeah it's okay to be offended everybody thank you harder

246
00:24:01.36 --> 00:24:06.24
there came a day when someone handed light hair a bow and a quiver of arrows to suited to his

247
00:24:06.24 --> 00:24:10.64
size and strength it was the first tangible sign of life that lay ahead and his mother smiled

248
00:24:10.64 --> 00:24:16.16
because she was proud or son would fall the path of a hunter and warrior hey the caveat obviously

249
00:24:16.16 --> 00:24:20.96
not reading the whole book it's an awesome book if you if it sounds a little stilted when I'm reading

250
00:24:20.96 --> 00:24:26.72
it like wait what's going on it's cuz I'm not reading the whole book get it and the audio book

251
00:24:26.72 --> 00:24:32.96
you mentioned I think the audio book is read by the author so that makes it good too change came

252
00:24:32.96 --> 00:24:37.36
into light hair's life and this is fast forward change came into light hair's life and yet another

253
00:24:37.36 --> 00:24:45.36
way she who gave him life lost her own in the perception of the child at the time the perception

254
00:24:45.36 --> 00:24:50.80
perception of time for a child can be often be irrelevant especially in a culture that was not

255
00:24:50.80 --> 00:24:55.68
given to measuring it he was too young to understand that death is a part of life later he would

256
00:24:55.68 --> 00:25:02.40
realize his mother's time on earth had been much too short so his mother dies when he's young

257
00:25:02.40 --> 00:25:11.68
fast forward a little bit more seasons turned and I just just FYI you know be in a guy that's

258
00:25:11.68 --> 00:25:16.08
in the language and stuff there's a whole section that this thing starts off talking about the

259
00:25:16.08 --> 00:25:21.36
the language the Lakota language really cool the read I'm not gonna read it for two reasons

260
00:25:21.36 --> 00:25:26.64
the primary reason being just me sitting here trying to pronounce these words would be a disaster

261
00:25:26.64 --> 00:25:33.04
uh but they add a lot to the story when you read the story so another reason to get the book

262
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:41.20
one day light hair and his sister were given new mothers they were sisters quiet and polite as they

263
00:25:41.20 --> 00:25:46.16
walked into the circle of their new life as the wives of crazy horse so the crazy horse that we're

264
00:25:46.16 --> 00:25:52.08
talking about in this particular moment is the dad the dad that you mentioned Jason is a medicine man

265
00:25:52.08 --> 00:25:55.92
so the dad is named crazy horse at this time and that's where they're talking about when they

266
00:25:55.92 --> 00:26:02.000
refer to crazy horse not light hair the son who is the crazy horse that we all know about and their

267
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:09.44
mothers and daughters of his own son um going forward a little bit more the boy didn't completely

268
00:26:09.44 --> 00:26:14.64
understand all about his father but he did know that crazy horse didn't hunt like the other man

269
00:26:14.64 --> 00:26:21.20
or go to war a father who is a medicine man and didn't do the things men did cause the boy to feel

270
00:26:21.20 --> 00:26:28.08
all the more different he wondered most of all why he looked different than the other boys so that's

271
00:26:28.08 --> 00:26:34.96
another thing in his childhood everyone's talking about my dad's in the deems or my dad's going

272
00:26:34.96 --> 00:26:40.72
to war and he's like well my dad's gonna go uh you know move smoke around and stuff so he feels awkward

273
00:26:40.72 --> 00:26:48.88
about that hunting was the Lakota lifeblood like the wolf fox eagle mountain lion and hawk

274
00:26:48.88 --> 00:26:53.28
the Lakota were hunters at age seven light hair realized more and more that hunting was the way to

275
00:26:53.28 --> 00:26:59.12
have fresh meat and deer and elk hides for clothing and buffalo hide for lodge coverings he also

276
00:26:59.12 --> 00:27:04.16
sense that he would be part of the process somehow like all boys light hair was becoming skilled

277
00:27:04.16 --> 00:27:10.80
with his bow he had progressed to a stout a stout her bow stronger than the first he was given

278
00:27:10.80 --> 00:27:16.16
one made in proportion to his size and strength his favorite game had changed as well shooting arrows

279
00:27:16.16 --> 00:27:23.04
through a rolling willow hoop had become too easy in boring so his uncle little hawk and a few

280
00:27:23.04 --> 00:27:31.12
other men introduced him to a new game shooting at grasshoppers the rules were simple walk along the

281
00:27:31.12 --> 00:27:36.72
prairie with an arrow on the bow string and shoot it a grasshopper when it flew rolling hope a rolling

282
00:27:36.72 --> 00:27:41.20
hoop was a much easier target a grasshopper was about the size of his little finger in flew

283
00:27:41.20 --> 00:27:47.52
erratically and fast the men would suppress smiles when it first the boy was able to get off a shot

284
00:27:48.72 --> 00:27:53.84
before he could pull back the string the insect was back in the grass but as he learned to hold

285
00:27:53.84 --> 00:27:59.04
his bow ready he could send an arrow in the general direction of the flitting grasshopper shooting

286
00:27:59.04 --> 00:28:05.36
a grasshoppers was not boring it was he learned of very humbling experience as the summer war on

287
00:28:05.36 --> 00:28:11.84
his reaction became faster and more and more his arrows only narrowly missed grasshoppers and old

288
00:28:11.84 --> 00:28:20.56
man told him have much to teach awesome just awesome stuff you're going out to see

289
00:28:20.56 --> 00:28:25.20
Dudley aren't you and you're just thinking that I wonder if you're going to start

290
00:28:25.20 --> 00:28:35.52
that walking around zapping grasshopper yeah you're going to get dialed in um freaking awesome what a

291
00:28:36.56 --> 00:28:44.08
what a way to grow up and what a way to get good you're just that's what you do that's what you do

292
00:28:47.12 --> 00:28:51.76
fast forward a little bit important character comes into play as the days passed he unknowingly

293
00:28:51.76 --> 00:28:57.68
attracted the interest of a and curiosity of a man called high backbone the mini conjue with a

294
00:28:57.68 --> 00:29:05.04
ogala wife a gala wife and he liked what he saw in the shy light hair and I might I don't think

295
00:29:05.04 --> 00:29:13.52
I'd mention that yet so Marshall mentioned it that crazy horse is quiet and he doesn't talk a lot

296
00:29:13.52 --> 00:29:18.16
but they they do give some examples in the book of when he's a kid they're playing games and he's not saying

297
00:29:18.16 --> 00:29:24.40
anything you know he just he's a quiet he's a quiet the term he used here shy perhaps it was the

298
00:29:24.40 --> 00:29:31.60
boys quiet determination or is innate humility high backbone himself was a quiet man not given

299
00:29:31.60 --> 00:29:38.32
to pursuing the path of glory but he was deeply committed to achieving the status of wika the complete man

300
00:29:39.44 --> 00:29:44.64
the complete man embodied the best qualities of the hunter and the fighting man

301
00:29:44.64 --> 00:29:52.24
though all men necessarily filled the roles of both provider and protector the hunter warrior

302
00:29:52.24 --> 00:29:58.88
not everyone could achieve the highest ideals for both calling high backbone was one of the few

303
00:29:59.68 --> 00:30:06.96
high backbone was a leader of fighting men muscular and broad shoulder exuding the confidence of a man

304
00:30:06.96 --> 00:30:16.56
who not only had physical strength but also a lifetime of experience and accomplishment so this guy

305
00:30:16.56 --> 00:30:26.56
high backbone kind of becomes a mentor to to light hair and this idea this idea of being good

306
00:30:26.56 --> 00:30:32.08
and multiple phases you know it's what who you say about the ruby cube chamberland chamberland yeah

307
00:30:32.08 --> 00:30:37.44
because it's like you know yeah he's good on every side that you examine yeah and that's that's

308
00:30:37.44 --> 00:30:43.44
what high backbone has that same quality they lay out these these virtues of the wika which I

309
00:30:43.44 --> 00:30:50.16
thought was was really interesting on go and it's it's in the forward but it says the the virtues

310
00:30:50.16 --> 00:30:57.84
are generosity courage fortitude and wisdom those and the very first thing they're saying for a

311
00:30:57.84 --> 00:31:06.08
warrior in a man is is generosity which is pretty cool courage and fortitude and wisdom yeah

312
00:31:10.32 --> 00:31:16.16
fast forward a little bit like most Lakota boys approaching the age of 12 light hair was a

313
00:31:16.16 --> 00:31:20.08
proficient hunter like all hunters light hair learned to sit motionless and the drift would

314
00:31:20.08 --> 00:31:24.72
blind along a creek for the better part of an afternoon waiting for a white tail to move within

315
00:31:24.72 --> 00:31:29.84
effective killing range of his bow which is as far as he could throw a stone with all his might

316
00:31:30.56 --> 00:31:37.68
it's pretty cool that's a pretty good uh i'm thinking he's probably able to go

317
00:31:40.56 --> 00:31:46.80
60 yards what's your estimation oh no he's 12 years old he's 12 years old he's

318
00:31:46.80 --> 00:31:52.88
don't rock what do you think he could throw rock I think he's probably at 15 or 20 yards really

319
00:31:52.88 --> 00:31:59.04
yeah echo Charles assessment 35 40 though because think about it what's his draw what's his

320
00:31:59.92 --> 00:32:05.68
draw on his strength yeah 12 it's it's probably not that hard pretty small yeah that's a good point

321
00:32:06.64 --> 00:32:09.92
but dude we're talking about a kid that's just walking around freaking shooting grass

322
00:32:09.92 --> 00:32:18.08
animals all day long so well and if you heard about like the the the the old British long bow

323
00:32:18.08 --> 00:32:23.28
archers that had like a draw weight of 120 pounds or something and they weren't compound bows

324
00:32:23.28 --> 00:32:31.36
they were just drawing back that much weight yeah so the Mongols had 80 pound bows that's insane that's

325
00:32:31.36 --> 00:32:38.96
insane yeah um we interesting to hear what they're they're what they've someone on the other put in the

326
00:32:38.96 --> 00:32:48.32
column yeah someone will tell us some will tell us what the what that range was so he's hunting um

327
00:32:49.92 --> 00:32:55.36
here's another he's got another friend another friend named lone bear fast forward a little bit

328
00:32:55.36 --> 00:33:00.32
lone bear and light hair road straight to a slight rise north of the fort and this is so now there's

329
00:33:00.32 --> 00:33:07.68
they're they're doing exploring kind of like kid stuff and they go to look at fort lairamy

330
00:33:07.68 --> 00:33:15.28
warned by crazy horse that's the dad and high back bone not to go nearer but it was a good enough

331
00:33:15.28 --> 00:33:20.96
vantage point to see buildings in this rounding area a wide trail led to the fort from the southeast

332
00:33:20.96 --> 00:33:26.72
and a way to the west on the other side of the main area of activity which was among the light

333
00:33:26.72 --> 00:33:35.04
colored buildings and along the trail what were what they could only assumed to be abandoned wagons

334
00:33:35.04 --> 00:33:39.04
they resembled skeletons most of them stripped down of the frames whites were everywhere

335
00:33:39.92 --> 00:33:45.36
along with their horses mules oxen and cattle the occasional barking of dogs reached the boys ears

336
00:33:46.08 --> 00:33:51.68
south of the buildings they could see the tops of several Lakota lodges a few Lakota stayed near

337
00:33:51.68 --> 00:33:56.72
the fort from the days before the soldiers had taken over in the days when it was only a trade

338
00:33:56.72 --> 00:34:04.40
trading town now the rumors were the soldiers had come to protect the travelers along the shell river

339
00:34:04.40 --> 00:34:13.20
trail and again there's he gives a lot of good detail about all the way this settlement is happening

340
00:34:13.20 --> 00:34:18.000
the whites are coming how they're doing it what it looks like to to the Indians

341
00:34:22.96 --> 00:34:25.92
yeah and I'm trying to give enough that you can understand the story

342
00:34:26.80 --> 00:34:31.04
there's a real bad smallpox outbreak prior to this happening a lot of them are just like

343
00:34:31.04 --> 00:34:38.32
just I'm staying away from my people period yeah it's a white-out entire groups of people yeah

344
00:34:39.28 --> 00:34:46.48
yeah they're scared of that they don't want any of that the Lakota called the council at horse

345
00:34:46.48 --> 00:34:55.28
creek the white piece talkers called it the fort Laramie treaty council of 1851 the whites

346
00:34:55.28 --> 00:35:00.80
wanted three things first they wanted no more fighting among the people gathered the black

347
00:35:00.80 --> 00:35:06.16
fleet the black feet and the crow were called upon to live in peace with the Lakota and the

348
00:35:06.16 --> 00:35:12.88
Lakota were in turn to live in peace with the snakes and so on tell the wind to stop blowing

349
00:35:12.88 --> 00:35:19.68
some reacted or the rivers to stop flowing second the whites seem to want to say where the

350
00:35:19.68 --> 00:35:25.84
land ended and where it began by drawing a picture on a parched hide beyond a certain line was

351
00:35:25.84 --> 00:35:32.96
Crowland and behind it was black feet but who could find that line on the earth someone wondered

352
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.40
third the travelers on the shell river trail must not be molested they said for they were

353
00:35:40.40 --> 00:35:45.76
traveling under the protection of the great father who lived in some city far to the east of the

354
00:35:45.76 --> 00:35:50.88
grandfather river the great father would know if his people on the trail were harmed

355
00:35:50.88 --> 00:35:56.56
the trail must be holy in some fashion suggested an old Lakota man Riley

356
00:35:57.36 --> 00:36:04.48
thereafter the shell river trail became known as the holy road for green to these three things

357
00:36:04.48 --> 00:36:12.08
the peacetalker said the great father was empowering them to pay a new eddies that amounted to many

358
00:36:12.08 --> 00:36:18.40
thousands of their money in dollars the newbies would be in the form of food beef cattle flower

359
00:36:18.40 --> 00:36:24.40
and beans for starters and various other goods such as plows hose and other farm implements

360
00:36:26.24 --> 00:36:30.64
there were many raised eyebrows and helpless shrugs at the listening of listing of other goods

361
00:36:30.64 --> 00:36:43.84
but in the end they were accepted very very strange you know like it's just a complete

362
00:36:43.84 --> 00:36:53.60
it's a culture just totally separate even as you're hearing this deal you're thinking

363
00:36:53.60 --> 00:36:56.80
like you're going to say this land is my that's like if you came into me right now and said hey

364
00:36:56.80 --> 00:37:02.24
a jockel give you money for your for the air i'd say uh you want to give me money for air cool

365
00:37:02.88 --> 00:37:08.72
okay you give me money i then also you had some contraption that like sucked the air oh yeah exactly

366
00:37:08.72 --> 00:37:12.56
I was trying to wrap my head around this whole thing and you're that's exactly what's what's

367
00:37:12.56 --> 00:37:21.68
what's going on and it's it's clear that like the whites there they they they obviously weren't

368
00:37:21.68 --> 00:37:25.60
organized and sound kind screwed up too because they had their stuff they were trying to muddle

369
00:37:25.60 --> 00:37:30.72
their way whole things through this this whole mass on like hey we've got a newbies coming and

370
00:37:30.72 --> 00:37:38.96
then they don't show up and they're like uh what's uh the annuity's too is a real good you can see

371
00:37:38.96 --> 00:37:47.20
we're gonna see it throughout this story just the way that we as people if you become

372
00:37:47.20 --> 00:37:52.80
reliant on someone else if you're given stuff you become reliant and you forget how to do things for

373
00:37:52.80 --> 00:38:01.04
yourself you know i don't know if the grand plan of the whites was to get them hooked on these

374
00:38:01.04 --> 00:38:05.04
annuities and then we can just kind of take advantage of i don't know if that was their grand plan

375
00:38:05.04 --> 00:38:11.52
but that's what happens it definitely like it part part of a three-prong strategy one

376
00:38:12.32 --> 00:38:17.12
the annuities which i bet you they were just doing to kind of like calm things down but then it

377
00:38:17.12 --> 00:38:23.92
wound up being like what actually screwed everybody over and it's so reliveent to today

378
00:38:24.88 --> 00:38:31.60
right because these annuities are like the algorithms on social media or they're like fast food

379
00:38:31.60 --> 00:38:38.48
or all kinds of other real easy stuff that's like oh cool i'll just swing through McDonald's

380
00:38:38.48 --> 00:38:44.48
because i'm kind of hungry in not order something healthy off their menu and then

381
00:38:46.08 --> 00:38:51.76
then you messed up yeah i mean anytime this is you know if from a greater perspective

382
00:38:51.76 --> 00:38:56.16
communism right hey look i'm gonna pay you regardless if you do your job well or not

383
00:38:57.04 --> 00:39:01.44
well okay cool i'm not gonna do my job well and you're gonna pay me right that's

384
00:39:01.44 --> 00:39:06.72
great it happens with you know certain positions certain government positions like oh

385
00:39:06.72 --> 00:39:11.60
you're gonna get that you're gonna get that paycheck regardless if you're at the DMV no offense

386
00:39:11.60 --> 00:39:16.08
DMV but if you work at the DMV it doesn't matter if you process

387
00:39:17.60 --> 00:39:25.52
four license applications today or 29 what's your motivation to produce any more stuff if it's

388
00:39:25.52 --> 00:39:29.44
all gonna get taken from you and redistributed then you're just gonna do the minimum

389
00:39:29.44 --> 00:39:34.96
and i think that's what one of the reasons why colonialism is kind of falling on its

390
00:39:34.96 --> 00:39:43.28
face and all it is it's very disturbing so fast forward a little bit each summer's lines and

391
00:39:43.28 --> 00:39:47.92
lines of wagons were not the same as those that had come the summer before they carried a different

392
00:39:47.92 --> 00:39:53.92
group of whites who had never seen a Lakota or a Kaewa or a blue cow cloud but who had been filled

393
00:39:53.92 --> 00:40:00.96
with stories about the dangers from the brown skin mirotters so wide eyed and fearful of

394
00:40:00.96 --> 00:40:07.36
were the whites who arrived at the fort not comforted by the sites of scowling Lakota men

395
00:40:08.48 --> 00:40:13.36
but the Lakota were likewise troubled at the sight of so many white men some of the old ones

396
00:40:13.36 --> 00:40:20.96
would shake their gray heads and speak a warning in any land among any kind of people three human

397
00:40:20.96 --> 00:40:32.24
weaknesses are at the root of trouble fear anger and arrogance right i'll relevant is that to us today

398
00:40:32.80 --> 00:40:39.92
yep fear anger and arrogance those weaknesses were about to be mixed

399
00:40:39.92 --> 00:40:52.64
yeah fear anger and arrogance by the way root cause those obviously arrogance is ego but anger often

400
00:40:52.64 --> 00:41:01.52
also ego and a lot of these circumstances are very egotistical in this book that the anger is triggered

401
00:41:01.52 --> 00:41:07.60
from ego yeah and the hatred which i think kakana is a little bit different but you can attach it

402
00:41:07.60 --> 00:41:18.32
to anger and usually it's rooted in some kind of fear no life has a way of creating strange

403
00:41:18.32 --> 00:41:30.80
circumstances that often lead to a bad end or an unexpected turn when i read that i was like damn it

404
00:41:30.80 --> 00:41:38.56
you know because you don't want to admit that don't want to admit it you don't want to say you know

405
00:41:38.56 --> 00:41:47.04
what let's sometimes things happen that result to a bad end it's such a sad thing to think about

406
00:41:47.04 --> 00:41:56.72
but it's the freaking reality of life so he goes on to this section here

407
00:41:56.72 --> 00:42:06.32
that speaking of anger and fear and arrogance there's a there's a cow that wanders into this

408
00:42:06.32 --> 00:42:12.96
camp and it says it was into conquering bears camp that an old foot sore cow wandered on especially

409
00:42:12.96 --> 00:42:18.40
hot afternoon the Lakota didn't own any cattle of course so it was correctly assumed that she had

410
00:42:18.40 --> 00:42:23.68
been lost or abandoned by some white man trying to escape the barking dogs she was running between

411
00:42:23.68 --> 00:42:29.44
lodges knocking over meat racks after the loft or stop someone realized that although old and thin

412
00:42:29.44 --> 00:42:43.52
she was fresh meat so they you know they kill a cow word of the predicament spread quickly

413
00:42:43.52 --> 00:42:49.76
through the camps because now someone's mad i think believe it was a Mormon they call it they keep

414
00:42:49.76 --> 00:42:56.96
calling the Mormon man a Mormon man wanted the cow he's complaining the soldiers that is cow had

415
00:42:56.96 --> 00:43:05.20
been stolen so word of the predicament quickly spread through the camps the next afternoon the soldiers

416
00:43:05.20 --> 00:43:11.44
started from the fort in two wagons and with two wagon guns but the man leading them was not

417
00:43:11.44 --> 00:43:16.40
flemming this is one of the soldiers that they had worked with or knew it was one called

418
00:43:16.40 --> 00:43:24.32
gratin a new officer lately come from the east with him was a man married to a Lakota woman

419
00:43:24.32 --> 00:43:31.20
a speaks white brought along to translate gratin it was later learned had been loud about his

420
00:43:31.20 --> 00:43:40.48
disdain for the Lakota so you got now an arrogant guy that's also afraid and when the soldiers

421
00:43:40.48 --> 00:43:44.72
reached his camp conquering bear left his lodged to meet them even as they jumped from the wagons

422
00:43:44.72 --> 00:43:49.44
and formed two lines facing the camp the old man was still trying to stop the trouble but his

423
00:43:49.44 --> 00:43:54.48
efforts were ignored meanwhile the speaks white road up and down the line of soldiers shouting

424
00:43:54.48 --> 00:44:02.88
threats in Lakota south of the camp hidden in low shrubbery light hair and lone bear so you got

425
00:44:02.88 --> 00:44:08.32
young crazy horse and his little buddy watched the old man and strained to hear him but couldn't

426
00:44:08.32 --> 00:44:15.04
gratin stepped down from his horse and helped load one of the wagon guns aimed into the camp

427
00:44:15.60 --> 00:44:22.80
the officer shouted the wagon gun blasted and all movement seemed to come to a stop but for a heartbeat

428
00:44:23.52 --> 00:44:29.28
the tops of a lodged lodges poles splintered into many pieces then the soldiers aimed their

429
00:44:29.28 --> 00:44:36.80
rifles and fired before the echo from the wagon gun had faded a astonished and unable to immediately

430
00:44:36.80 --> 00:44:42.80
perceive the reality unfolding before their eyes the two boys watched conquering bear fall back

431
00:44:42.80 --> 00:44:48.64
struck in the chest and stomach the second wagon gun boomed and then the Lakota men reacted

432
00:44:49.04 --> 00:44:54.80
before the soldiers could reload their rifles to fire again a few Lakota guns boomed arrows flew

433
00:44:54.80 --> 00:45:00.24
and then angry men ran toward the scattering soldiers gratin was one of the first to fall

434
00:45:00.24 --> 00:45:09.44
so like that's how things kind of start to go bad in the world it's like a little

435
00:45:09.44 --> 00:45:16.56
misunderstanding then you have that anger that fear that arrogance and initially they tried

436
00:45:16.56 --> 00:45:20.32
at some point prior to this whole thing break and I'm like hey we're going to give you

437
00:45:20.32 --> 00:45:25.20
sorry about the cow we're going to give you a couple of good horses way better than a cow

438
00:45:25.20 --> 00:45:32.56
and our estimation in in trade for that and they're like oh no no that's not going to work

439
00:45:35.76 --> 00:45:40.80
show up and start shooting which obviously does not work nothing work out well for

440
00:45:40.80 --> 00:45:43.76
grab doesn't work out well for grab does it work out well for anybody no

441
00:45:48.32 --> 00:45:50.72
there's a there's certain sections in this book

442
00:45:50.72 --> 00:45:56.40
so there's books there's part of the book he's telling the story of crazy horse and

443
00:45:56.40 --> 00:46:02.88
he's got sections marshals got sections and here called called reflections and he's got

444
00:46:02.88 --> 00:46:11.60
this one section where he kind of gives his perspective on what he on on the events that he's

445
00:46:11.60 --> 00:46:16.80
kind of written about he says and I'm not going to read the whole thing there's a whole bunch of

446
00:46:16.80 --> 00:46:20.16
incredible points that he may express he says crazy horse came into the world at least for

447
00:46:20.16 --> 00:46:25.92
generations ahead of mine he was born in the early 1840s perhaps as late as 1845 I was born in

448
00:46:25.92 --> 00:46:31.84
1945 as Lakota males he and I have much in common enough Lakota culture has survived through

449
00:46:31.84 --> 00:46:37.68
changes during those four generations fortunately to allow my generation to identify strongly

450
00:46:37.68 --> 00:46:44.80
with his so he has like things in common he says this by the time light hair was 10 or 11

451
00:46:44.80 --> 00:46:50.48
euro americans were a consistent presence and an increasing annoyance the Oregon trailer

452
00:46:50.48 --> 00:46:56.56
had been caught across the southern part of the territory beginning the late 1840s it became a steady

453
00:46:56.56 --> 00:47:02.08
stream of white emigrants moving east to west from late spring to mid summer tens of thousands of

454
00:47:02.08 --> 00:47:07.68
people thousands of oxen mules and horses and hundreds of wagons passed through every summer for 20

455
00:47:07.68 --> 00:47:14.48
years those people carried with them many things new to Lakota some beneficial such as

456
00:47:14.48 --> 00:47:23.20
iron knives and cooking pots and some destructive such as liquor and disease most of all they brought change

457
00:47:26.24 --> 00:47:30.32
my grandparents and their generation were not too different from light hairs parents and

458
00:47:30.32 --> 00:47:36.72
grandparents the elderly the Kota of the 1850s in the face of the white incursion and changes brought

459
00:47:36.72 --> 00:47:41.76
to them were telling stories and reminding their children and grandchildren to remember the

460
00:47:41.76 --> 00:47:50.24
trailers they had walked hand crafting a bow out of ash is almost a lost art for the Lakota

461
00:47:51.12 --> 00:47:57.76
my grandfather taught me because his father white tail feather and second father which is a step

462
00:47:57.76 --> 00:48:03.20
father Henry two hawk taught him to make bows and arrows they learned it from their fathers and

463
00:48:03.20 --> 00:48:08.88
grandfather's and the methods and process are the same as those that were taught to light hair

464
00:48:08.88 --> 00:48:15.76
exactly the same each time i've had the opportunity to make a bow a thought invariably passes through

465
00:48:15.76 --> 00:48:23.04
my mind this is the way it has been done for hundreds of generations i make my bows the same way

466
00:48:23.04 --> 00:48:29.68
crazy horse did that is only one of the many connections i have with him as Lakota boys

467
00:48:31.68 --> 00:48:35.76
there's a great discussion somewhere in this book where they're talking about the elders and they're

468
00:48:35.76 --> 00:48:44.000
talking specifically about change they're like hey we used to use lances to hunt the buffalo

469
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.88
before we came up with bows and arrows and we transitioned over that so we've got to be ready

470
00:48:49.92 --> 00:48:55.36
to change as things as things come along and they give that historical example and that's a

471
00:48:55.36 --> 00:48:59.52
struggle isn't it when when we think of valued traditions that we have in our culture

472
00:48:59.52 --> 00:49:05.84
like what what do we strive to hold on to and and what do we let go of as we grow yeah and there's

473
00:49:05.84 --> 00:49:10.24
i i don't remember if i'm going to cover this or not but i'll bring it up right now one of those

474
00:49:10.24 --> 00:49:15.36
same just types of discussions they're talking about there's a time when it's time to get on the new horse

475
00:49:16.48 --> 00:49:21.36
and like the old horse isn't working anymore you gotta get on a new horse and and that's a

476
00:49:21.36 --> 00:49:25.76
good expression to keep in your mind because you're riding that horse and it's starting to fade or

477
00:49:25.76 --> 00:49:30.48
it's not able to do it's job anymore yet got again on a new horse even though you're comfortable

478
00:49:30.48 --> 00:49:35.84
with your old horse even though you that old horse's been good to you it's not going to work out anymore

479
00:49:35.84 --> 00:49:46.08
you've got to be ready to transition to the new horse getting now back into the the story

480
00:49:46.80 --> 00:49:50.96
out of the reflections and back into the story light hair had been in the camp but a few days

481
00:49:50.96 --> 00:49:57.52
when a rating party prepared to go against the pony and omaha who had become too daring of late

482
00:49:57.52 --> 00:50:04.000
coming north well past the running water he accepted the invitation to go along the raiders in the

483
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:10.32
eat the raiders went east toward the loop river an area of rolling hills and tall grass and many

484
00:50:10.32 --> 00:50:16.48
deer there they separated into two groups one turned south to probe into pony country and the other

485
00:50:16.48 --> 00:50:22.32
with spotted tail and iron shell leading had spotted an omaha camp in the breaks of the east in

486
00:50:22.32 --> 00:50:28.88
the breaks east of the loop a small number of the group crept close to the camp while the rest

487
00:50:28.88 --> 00:50:34.56
hidden weighted light hair was won staying close to his uncle they crawled in among the horse

488
00:50:34.56 --> 00:50:38.96
heard and slowly cut the hobbles from the horses legs and chased them out of the camp

489
00:50:39.92 --> 00:50:46.000
though the omaha didn't immediately respond a large contingent soon started out to recover

490
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:52.24
their horses spotted tails group waited a little longer than attacked the camp the few omaha

491
00:50:52.24 --> 00:50:58.40
men left in camp fought hard but so did the Lakota spotted tail charged several times on horse

492
00:50:58.40 --> 00:51:04.72
back alone and light hair claimed his first victory as a fighting man and omaha tried to attack

493
00:51:04.72 --> 00:51:11.12
through some tall grass but light hair stopped him with a well placed arrow the confusion and chaos

494
00:51:11.12 --> 00:51:16.64
delayed his reaction what he had just done though he was vaguely aware of the man's death throws

495
00:51:17.60 --> 00:51:22.72
seized by a sudden bravado he crawled through the grass to take the scalp of his first kill

496
00:51:25.04 --> 00:51:30.32
a wave of sickness swept through him the dead omaha was a young woman

497
00:51:31.36 --> 00:51:38.32
he turned away the fighting was over the raided been successful though the omaha had recovered

498
00:51:38.32 --> 00:51:44.40
some of their horses spotted tails daring and courage was the talk around the fire light hair

499
00:51:44.40 --> 00:51:52.32
sat quietly wrestling with the reality of taking a human life like all newcomers to it he had

500
00:51:52.32 --> 00:51:58.72
learned something about the unfettered violence of combat ordinary perception did not exist

501
00:51:58.72 --> 00:52:05.84
and senses became confused the omaha who attacked him seemed to move so swiftly two swiftly

502
00:52:05.84 --> 00:52:11.20
for a developer at reaction on the other hand when he had let go of her head because he didn't

503
00:52:11.20 --> 00:52:19.28
want her scalp everything around him seemed to move very very slowly her hair was soft thick and very

504
00:52:19.28 --> 00:52:25.20
long light hair said nothing although he knew the overall outcome of the raided been good

505
00:52:26.32 --> 00:52:32.64
they had no they had new horses and no one had been hurt but the face of the dead girl stayed in his mind

506
00:52:32.64 --> 00:52:44.88
it's a humbling experience for him and he they go into it and we'll get to some of these parts

507
00:52:44.88 --> 00:52:49.68
but you know when they get done with a battle they go back and kind of tell stories and that's the

508
00:52:49.68 --> 00:52:58.000
norm and he's already a quiet kid and this just solidifies the fact that he's not going to talk

509
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:08.16
about what he's doing a man from the fort came looking for iron shell with a message from the

510
00:53:08.16 --> 00:53:14.80
French trader burdo the long knives and it's a the long knives what they call the the soldiers because

511
00:53:14.80 --> 00:53:21.12
they have long swords they call long knives they call the soldiers long knives the long knives had

512
00:53:21.12 --> 00:53:26.16
received word that the great father which is basically when they say that they're talking about

513
00:53:26.16 --> 00:53:33.28
the president or at least some form of the supreme government of America the great father was

514
00:53:33.28 --> 00:53:38.80
very angry over the killing of gratin and his soldiers more soldiers were being sent and their purpose

515
00:53:38.80 --> 00:53:45.20
was to punish those who had done the killing it was an ominous message but not won totally unexpected

516
00:53:45.76 --> 00:53:51.44
had the great father been told that the soldier gratin had to open fire first had the great father

517
00:53:51.44 --> 00:53:56.88
been told that more than adequate payment had been offered several times for the worst the worthless

518
00:53:56.88 --> 00:54:03.20
cow of the Mormon white man why should the great father care about such facts someone asked that

519
00:54:03.20 --> 00:54:09.92
was the problem everyone agreed the whites had one truth and the Lakota another

520
00:54:09.92 --> 00:54:19.12
yeah having talking about that quite a bit especially on the academy

521
00:54:21.36 --> 00:54:25.60
I haven't used those terms you know I have one truth and you have another but I was say

522
00:54:25.60 --> 00:54:31.60
I have one perspective and you have another perspective and if you think that your perspective

523
00:54:32.48 --> 00:54:38.24
is the right one you're you're not correct I mean it's literally not if you can't say that

524
00:54:38.24 --> 00:54:42.48
you can't look at something you can't look at a situation you can't look at a plan you can't look at an

525
00:54:42.48 --> 00:54:49.60
idea you can't look at a scenario and say oh I see everything and I understand it

526
00:54:50.64 --> 00:54:54.80
the the old saying there's two sides to every story actually there's 48 sides to a story

527
00:54:54.80 --> 00:55:00.72
yeah right there's all these different sides and when these things break down

528
00:55:01.60 --> 00:55:06.08
it's because you're not listening to other sides of the story it's not you you're believing your own

529
00:55:06.08 --> 00:55:11.60
story your own side of the story and you can't let that happen and you have to you have to put

530
00:55:11.60 --> 00:55:15.68
into your calculus that other people see things differently if you don't put out in your calculus

531
00:55:15.68 --> 00:55:25.92
you're not going to get the right answer so many of these wars so many wars are just

532
00:55:27.12 --> 00:55:32.32
misunderstanding start with just a straight-up misunderstanding or a little incident that could be

533
00:55:32.32 --> 00:55:41.76
de-escalated it just turns into the freaking disaster summer past light hair Guitoller his voice

534
00:55:41.76 --> 00:55:48.32
deepened and he walked with a sure step when there was dancing he stayed in the shadow satisfied only to watch

535
00:55:52.48 --> 00:55:57.44
light hair fast forward a little light light hair remounted and put his horse into a gallop

536
00:55:57.44 --> 00:56:01.36
from another and higher vantage point he could see that smoke was rising from the encampments so

537
00:56:01.36 --> 00:56:06.72
he's out on like a little personal patrol of his own which is he that's another thing I haven't

538
00:56:06.72 --> 00:56:12.80
done a good job indicating he likes to be by himself so he goes out and hunts by himself he goes

539
00:56:12.80 --> 00:56:18.24
out in the woods and just sets by himself he likes he's kind of a loner so he's out on one of

540
00:56:18.24 --> 00:56:25.28
these sort of solo operations and he says from another and higher vantage point he could see that

541
00:56:25.28 --> 00:56:32.40
smoke was rising from the encampment a few hurs horses were scattered about watching to the north but

542
00:56:32.40 --> 00:56:39.04
there was nothing else no children playing no dogs running about leaving his horse hobbled he ran

543
00:56:39.04 --> 00:56:46.56
toward the camp light was fading a dog bark tentatively and a stench hung in the air among the

544
00:56:46.56 --> 00:56:54.08
smoking lodges and collapse poles were objects scattered over the ground whatever had happened was over

545
00:56:54.08 --> 00:57:00.16
and eerie silence hung over the camp nothing was moving the horses he had spotted earlier had

546
00:57:00.16 --> 00:57:05.44
not moved they were still gazing and tantly at something toward the north light hair entered

547
00:57:05.44 --> 00:57:12.56
the camp the objects seen from a distance now took distinct shapes they were raw hide meat containers

548
00:57:12.56 --> 00:57:19.20
willow chairs clothing containers robes and cradle boards scattered indiscriminately as if by a

549
00:57:19.20 --> 00:57:27.84
sudden angry wind but it hadn't been a wind someone had attacked the encampment the horses had

550
00:57:27.84 --> 00:57:34.64
been telling him something looking north as they had he walked over to a hobbled mayor she appeared

551
00:57:34.64 --> 00:57:40.96
on harm so he fashioned a jaw rope untied the hobbles swung onto her back and urged her into a

552
00:57:40.96 --> 00:57:46.48
lope toward the north where there had been movement earlier if the people in the camp were running

553
00:57:46.48 --> 00:57:53.28
away they would be moving as fast as possible in a bear patch of ground he saw the grooves

554
00:57:53.28 --> 00:58:01.92
left by a pair of drag poles pausing to look he saw other signs of drag poles then he saw

555
00:58:01.92 --> 00:58:08.64
something else even in the fading light the distinctive prints of the metal shoes worn by long

556
00:58:08.64 --> 00:58:17.84
knife horses unless soldiers had taken a pulling dragging poles something wasn't right throwing

557
00:58:17.84 --> 00:58:24.08
caution aside light hair galloped in the direction of the signs and at the second or third hill he saw

558
00:58:24.08 --> 00:58:30.40
them people were walking and leading a few horses pulling loaded drag poles though it was

559
00:58:30.40 --> 00:58:37.52
difficult to count how many they were but on either side was a column of mounted soldiers they were

560
00:58:37.52 --> 00:58:45.52
heading northwest most of the men from little funders camp had been away hunting some of them were

561
00:58:45.52 --> 00:58:52.16
bound to return sooner or later but for the time being light hair was alone he returned for his own

562
00:58:52.16 --> 00:58:58.000
horse so he could take too long to follow his relatives who are captives of the long knives

563
00:58:59.84 --> 00:59:05.92
back at the burned out camp he retrieved his gilding and gathered stones from several cooking

564
00:59:05.92 --> 00:59:11.52
fires and built a marker pointing it to the northwest and he wouldn't know to go in that direction

565
00:59:11.52 --> 00:59:16.80
especially given the condition of the camp he had only been in the south end of the camp so he

566
00:59:16.80 --> 00:59:22.96
led his horse through it to the north end the mayor snorted in apprehension and shied away from a

567
00:59:22.96 --> 00:59:31.68
long dark object on the ground light hair bent to it and felt the leg it was a woman she was dead

568
00:59:31.68 --> 00:59:38.40
he discerned other shapes in the growing darkness and went to them they were all dead

569
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:45.76
he wretched after he bent low over a woman and realized that both her breasts had been cut off

570
00:59:47.84 --> 00:59:53.28
searching in the growing darkness he found one dead body after another all of them scalloped

571
00:59:53.28 --> 01:00:01.12
or mutilated in some fashion he wretched again and sat for some time before he pulled a row

572
01:00:01.12 --> 01:00:10.40
back from the next body a child this time perhaps ten gathering his horses he walked out of the camp

573
01:00:11.76 --> 01:00:18.000
he had covered everybody he found covering the shame of the insults they had suffered after the pain of death

574
01:00:20.16 --> 01:00:27.20
with the shock and the grief came another feeling starting like a small cloud growing over the

575
01:00:27.20 --> 01:00:54.48
horizon anger so that's gonna leave a mark you get to a point where there's a trajectory

576
01:00:54.48 --> 01:01:00.000
where it's almost impossible to stop the direction that things are going and when stuff happens like that

577
01:01:02.40 --> 01:01:09.44
what are you gonna do I mean you you you you

578
01:01:12.32 --> 01:01:16.80
through this book you you have a problem because there's this clash of cultures

579
01:01:17.68 --> 01:01:23.12
and the Lakota have a culture that that they're involved with raiding they're going up and

580
01:01:23.12 --> 01:01:29.12
raiding the crow they're they're raiding the uh um the snakes the snakes and the crow are

581
01:01:29.12 --> 01:01:35.04
raiding them back and it's just what they kind of do and there's an equilibrium there because

582
01:01:35.04 --> 01:01:42.80
they're not industrial and they can't like mechanize death the way the Europeans are capable

583
01:01:42.80 --> 01:01:49.36
at at the time yeah and they don't understand it and there's like a he doesn't say this at all

584
01:01:49.36 --> 01:01:56.96
but you can assemble it there's an ROI like a legit rules of engagement that they're following

585
01:01:57.52 --> 01:02:03.52
and you don't either there's just things that you don't do and there's times where he mentions in

586
01:02:03.52 --> 01:02:09.12
the book they're going to they're going on a raid to like to stay sharp yeah like hey we're just

587
01:02:09.12 --> 01:02:14.96
hey look this is like a training op but it's real and they're gonna go do it and and the other

588
01:02:14.96 --> 01:02:20.40
the other tribes kind of know that's hey this is part of what we do oh this is oh they're

589
01:02:20.40 --> 01:02:25.68
gonna run a training op we're gonna have to get some but there's rules of engagement and there's

590
01:02:25.68 --> 01:02:31.92
there's like um hey we're gonna go in we got some horses from you cool we're not slaughtering

591
01:02:31.92 --> 01:02:37.44
your people we got we we needed horses so we got some horses from right that's what we're doing

592
01:02:37.44 --> 01:02:43.36
oh we want we want you know some of the meat that you that you hunted okay cool we didn't get

593
01:02:43.36 --> 01:02:46.64
enough so we're gonna go take some of yours it's it's like there's rules of engagement that

594
01:02:46.64 --> 01:02:51.04
they're all operating on they were I think it was fairly common too when you raid like

595
01:02:51.04 --> 01:02:56.48
they mentioned in here and he leaves out like we attacked the village and there were no men left

596
01:02:56.48 --> 01:03:00.56
in the village are very few of them well what what did you do exactly and I don't think it was

597
01:03:00.56 --> 01:03:08.08
uncommon for them to snatch slaves up at a minimum from other villages I think you know the

598
01:03:08.56 --> 01:03:12.40
empire the summer moon which is another great book the command she were grabbing people from

599
01:03:12.40 --> 01:03:17.04
everywhere and then they would just assimilate I'm kind of in the tribe but they also did a lot of

600
01:03:17.04 --> 01:03:26.80
slave trading and other things at the time so there's no one that's completely clean in this whole

601
01:03:26.80 --> 01:03:36.80
situation and yeah it's just it's it's an interesting study that on all this stuff and how do

602
01:03:36.80 --> 01:03:43.04
you stop it once once that boulders rolling downhill I like you he comes in and he finds all the

603
01:03:43.04 --> 01:03:47.20
mutilated women like how do you put that fire out now it's gonna be rough

604
01:03:54.96 --> 01:04:01.52
there's a guy named harney the gizapp caramel maybe a general general general harney

605
01:04:01.52 --> 01:04:08.40
early in the morning soldiers had been seen moving up blue water spotted tail and iron

606
01:04:08.40 --> 01:04:13.60
shell and a few warrior leaders rode out under a white banner to talk of troops to talk

607
01:04:14.24 --> 01:04:19.52
the leader of the soldiers was a white haired man and bearded older man who said his name was

608
01:04:19.52 --> 01:04:24.64
general harney and they eventually put two and two together that this is the guy that led this raid

609
01:04:24.64 --> 01:04:29.44
or did come harney had stopped at Fort Laramie since he was the leader of the soldiers he declared

610
01:04:29.44 --> 01:04:33.44
an end to trading with the Lakota still demanding the surrender of the killers of grapon

611
01:04:34.40 --> 01:04:39.20
when the story of the attack on little funders camp on the on the blue water was carried north

612
01:04:39.20 --> 01:04:45.60
to the other Lakota camps general harney was given a new name to the Lakota he would always be known

613
01:04:45.60 --> 01:04:52.80
as woman killer so the fact that they're given him that specific name probably is an

614
01:04:52.80 --> 01:04:57.44
indicator that that's not common practice for them to kill him no that's not saying there's

615
01:04:57.44 --> 01:05:07.04
our oeze man that there were violate big time one evening he returned from a long outing with

616
01:05:07.04 --> 01:05:12.64
high backbone and waited for his father in the large large when crazy horse that's the dad

617
01:05:12.64 --> 01:05:17.76
returned the boy held out a bundle of tobacco it was a gift and offering to a holy man

618
01:05:17.76 --> 01:05:23.60
when one needed to speak from one's heart light hair needed to tell of a dream a dream that it

619
01:05:23.60 --> 01:05:29.84
come to him the second night he had spent alone on a sandstone bluff it had been with him every

620
01:05:29.84 --> 01:05:35.68
day and night for these many months he told his father dreams were important crazy horse said

621
01:05:36.40 --> 01:05:43.12
as he as he took the offering of tobacco from his oldest son so now we get into this dream

622
01:05:44.80 --> 01:05:49.84
the dream was not difficult to remember and this dream is like the central theme of this book so

623
01:05:49.84 --> 01:05:55.68
the dream was not difficult to remember only to tell it had been a part of the boy since the late

624
01:05:55.68 --> 01:06:02.56
summer night near the sand hill country when old conquering beer bear lay dying in camp after the

625
01:06:02.56 --> 01:06:08.56
incident with the soldiers with the soldier gratin in his men he was almost embarrassed to describe it

626
01:06:09.36 --> 01:06:16.32
the dream began at a lake a small still lake bursting upward from the blue calmness

627
01:06:16.32 --> 01:06:22.96
a horse and its writer broke through the surface and rode out across the land the writer was a man

628
01:06:22.96 --> 01:06:30.24
a slender man who wore his hair loose a stone was tied behind his left ear a reddish brown stone

629
01:06:30.24 --> 01:06:35.84
a lightning mark was painted across one side of his face on his bare chest were blue hailstones

630
01:06:36.56 --> 01:06:43.68
behind him behind them to the west as they galloped was a dark rolling cloud rising higher and higher

631
01:06:43.68 --> 01:06:51.44
from it came the deep rumble of thunder and flashes of lightning the horse was strong and swift

632
01:06:51.44 --> 01:06:59.52
and changed its colors red yellow black white and blue bullets and arrows suddenly filled the air

633
01:06:59.52 --> 01:07:06.56
flying at the horse and writer but they all passed without touching them close above them

634
01:07:06.56 --> 01:07:16.56
through a red tailed hawk sending out its shrill cry people his own kind suddenly rose up all around

635
01:07:16.56 --> 01:07:27.04
and grabbed the writer pulling him down from behind the dream ended there seemed to be a warning

636
01:07:27.04 --> 01:07:33.12
in the dream but glorious warrior in the dream was grown but still young the faces of the

637
01:07:33.12 --> 01:07:38.16
enemies that it sent bullets and arrows at him were not visible but the people who had pulled

638
01:07:38.16 --> 01:07:45.52
him down were like the writer himself they were easily seen as was the horse the hawk and the

639
01:07:45.52 --> 01:07:52.48
thunder's the thunder's they were the powerful beings that lived in the west perhaps the most

640
01:07:52.48 --> 01:07:59.52
powerful of all beings ever anywhere rarely did anyone dream of the thunder's and anyone who did

641
01:07:59.52 --> 01:08:05.60
had a special calling to be a sacred clown the one who did the opposite of what was expected light

642
01:08:05.60 --> 01:08:12.48
hered described the lightning mark on the dream writers face as well as blue hailstones painted

643
01:08:12.48 --> 01:08:18.88
across across his chest lightning and hail were both strongly associated with the thunder's

644
01:08:20.48 --> 01:08:25.44
crazy horse the door crazy horse closed the door and began singing again

645
01:08:25.44 --> 01:08:33.92
and another gathering song to call in the spirits he poured water on the stones sending steam

646
01:08:33.92 --> 01:08:40.48
and new waves of heat rolling inside the tiny enclosure light heren dirt the heat even as he had

647
01:08:40.48 --> 01:08:47.84
held the dream in his mind's eye as his father had instructed him to do dying gloriously

648
01:08:47.84 --> 01:08:53.92
making the ultimate sacrifice in defense of the people was the secret dream of every Lakota fighting

649
01:08:53.92 --> 01:09:02.88
man it was the warrior code repeated in all the honoring songs the dream seemed to suggest that the

650
01:09:02.88 --> 01:09:09.84
dreamer would gain honor and immortality by living and dying as a warrior but perhaps there was more

651
01:09:09.84 --> 01:09:15.44
to the dream perhaps there was a warning of a path that could not be avoided

652
01:09:15.44 --> 01:09:28.000
so there's a lot of foreshadowing in that dream of his life that he's not going to live very

653
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:34.72
long and not going to live to old age and the scariest thing I guess is the fact that people his own

654
01:09:34.72 --> 01:09:39.68
kind are the people that kind of drag him down from behind

655
01:09:39.68 --> 01:09:50.000
and you know this this got me to thinking you know when I had when I had a mica

656
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:57.52
think on the podcast and I started off by reading some stuff that he's either said or written

657
01:09:58.40 --> 01:10:06.000
and that was that one quote this native American quote and I don't know which tribe it came from

658
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:16.72
and I didn't research it but the quote is a diagnosis becomes a curse basically when you diagnose

659
01:10:16.72 --> 01:10:25.12
someone with something it can become a curse a self fulfilling prophecy you know and that's

660
01:10:25.12 --> 01:10:40.72
something to look out for you know it's something to look out for yeah it's it's um I think it's better

661
01:10:41.68 --> 01:10:46.48
as we go through the story to discuss it later the struggle that the tribe has between

662
01:10:47.28 --> 01:10:54.08
the folks that are going to the take the free annuities and the folks that are deciding to live wild

663
01:10:54.08 --> 01:11:03.36
and then that friction and that friction corrods them from the inside out yeah and man the

664
01:11:03.36 --> 01:11:12.16
egos that come into play are just very disturbing mentioned he's a few more characters coming

665
01:11:12.16 --> 01:11:16.16
to play even in the company of heat dog and lone bear light hair laughed and smiled less

666
01:11:16.16 --> 01:11:20.24
often and didn't participate in their banter as much as he usually did this after he kind of

667
01:11:20.24 --> 01:11:25.76
reports his dream to his dad his friends knew that crazy horse had taken light hair off somewhere

668
01:11:25.76 --> 01:11:31.04
for several days and at since returning their light hair friend was less communicative but they

669
01:11:31.04 --> 01:11:37.12
also knew that he always tried harder to win the games the boys played to emulate warriors

670
01:11:37.12 --> 01:11:43.76
in fact he rarely lost he was not always the fastest or the quickest or the best shot but he

671
01:11:43.76 --> 01:11:51.84
simply kept trying and though he didn't tell them what to do they still followed him because

672
01:11:51.84 --> 01:11:57.36
he didn't hesitate to take the lead he seemed to know instinctively the best trail to follow

673
01:11:57.36 --> 01:12:05.12
or the best way to do something word of light hair's dream had quietly spread among the fighting

674
01:12:05.12 --> 01:12:10.000
men sooner later some said the boy would have to put his medicine to the test there was only one

675
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.52
way to see if the enemies bullets and arrows would not strike him so preparations were made for

676
01:12:15.52 --> 01:12:21.92
raid north into crowlands crazy horse and little hawk had found a reddish brownstone for light

677
01:12:21.92 --> 01:12:26.40
hair to wear behind his left ear and taught him how to paint lightning and hail stone marks

678
01:12:26.40 --> 01:12:33.84
from his dream then a bullet gona stray while someone was practicing grazed light hairs knee

679
01:12:33.84 --> 01:12:41.92
it's like friendly fire scenario someone's out just training and get and crazed and light hair

680
01:12:41.92 --> 01:12:48.48
get shot though crazy horse says dad treated the wound carefully to him it was a sign

681
01:12:48.48 --> 01:12:53.44
a worrisome sign directly related to the people in the dream pulling the rider down

682
01:12:53.44 --> 01:13:08.72
for the dreamer there would be danger or harm from his own kind we get into the love story part of

683
01:13:08.72 --> 01:13:16.64
this scenario it's also tragic in many ways news is buzzing about a prominent family planning

684
01:13:16.64 --> 01:13:21.12
a coming out serenote ceremony for a favorite daughter there would be much feasting and dancing

685
01:13:21.12 --> 01:13:27.20
red cloud was an impressive figure of a man and had reputation as an orator he was the head of a

686
01:13:27.20 --> 01:13:33.28
large family and some would say he would be an important man for years to come so it was only natural

687
01:13:33.28 --> 01:13:37.92
that the people were excited that his niece black buffalo woman was to be honored

688
01:13:38.80 --> 01:13:43.76
as a tiny doide girl she'd cross light hairs path now and then now she was a beautiful willy

689
01:13:43.76 --> 01:13:51.12
girl with long glistening black hair light hair hung back as the crowd moved away and managed to

690
01:13:51.12 --> 01:13:57.44
catch a glimpse of her dress and a finally be to dress her hair in too long braids hanging down

691
01:13:57.44 --> 01:14:02.24
over her breast signifying she was now a woman that evening light hair stayed in the back of the

692
01:14:02.24 --> 01:14:06.96
crowd during the dancing black buffalo woman's brothers her father and her uncle stayed close to

693
01:14:06.96 --> 01:14:12.24
hers or a reminder that any would be suitor could count on having to prove his worth in order

694
01:14:12.24 --> 01:14:23.04
to become part of that family so he's got a little love interest black buffalo woman

695
01:14:27.36 --> 01:14:31.52
fast forward a little bit waiting for his first test to battle light hair watch for the signal

696
01:14:31.52 --> 01:14:37.68
from high backbone a stone's throat was right he had stripped to his breach cloth and and

697
01:14:37.68 --> 01:14:42.16
moccasins his hair loose in the manner of his dream and the lightning mark and hailstones painted

698
01:14:42.16 --> 01:14:48.40
on his chest at the back of his head he wore the tail feathers from a red tailed hawk pointing

699
01:14:48.40 --> 01:14:55.20
down as when the hawk was about to strike his prey behind his left ear was the reddish brown stone

700
01:14:55.20 --> 01:15:00.48
and his right handy held the bow two arrows against his palm and a thirmed clamped in his teeth

701
01:15:00.48 --> 01:15:07.12
his quiver bristling with arrows was tied to the front of his waist to be an easy reach

702
01:15:08.40 --> 01:15:14.88
a shout came from high backbone as he urged his his mount into a gallop to take him up the slope

703
01:15:14.88 --> 01:15:20.08
light hair and others did the same strangely each rider had only a vago awareness of the others

704
01:15:20.08 --> 01:15:27.68
though they could hear clearly dozens of hooves clathering on the rocky slope low angry sounded

705
01:15:27.68 --> 01:15:34.96
humming noises buzzed past their ears the the experience fighting men knew it was the sound of

706
01:15:34.96 --> 01:15:41.04
passing balls from enemy muzzle loaders the gunshots could be heard less than a heartbeat later

707
01:15:42.40 --> 01:15:48.40
a man with a gun stepped out from behind a rock light hairs shot was pure instinct and he didn't

708
01:15:48.40 --> 01:15:53.52
see if the arrow had hit his target his horse pitched forward the enemy who stepped from behind

709
01:15:53.52 --> 01:15:58.40
the rock had managed to shoot the animal in the chest light hair rolled across the rocky slope

710
01:15:58.40 --> 01:16:04.16
his horse was dead his bow was gone he quickly sliced the drag rope from his horse and ran down

711
01:16:04.16 --> 01:16:09.52
the slope first in one direction then another a loose horse came out of nowhere and he managed

712
01:16:09.52 --> 01:16:18.08
to grab a handful of mane and swing on there was gunfire from below an answering fire from the

713
01:16:18.08 --> 01:16:24.56
rocks at the top of the hill the horse was rushing up the slope in a blind panic and took his new

714
01:16:24.56 --> 01:16:33.04
rider among the rocks you got a commentary on grabbing a horse by the man just like that is so cool

715
01:16:34.24 --> 01:16:39.68
that that and it's not his horse it's just the guy so good he's grabbing any horse it comes by by the

716
01:16:39.68 --> 01:16:47.52
main just hopping on swing back up back into the fight the pistol he snapped off a shot with his pistol

717
01:16:47.52 --> 01:16:51.44
he snapped off a shot in a man who doubled over from the impact of the bullet gaining control of

718
01:16:51.44 --> 01:16:56.72
the horse he raised down the slope stopping to recover his bow his quiver was still tied to his waste

719
01:16:56.72 --> 01:17:02.24
high back bone joined him his horse winded together they charged up the slope again in and among the

720
01:17:02.24 --> 01:17:08.08
rocks this time light hair used his bow and put an arrow through an enemy's chest gunshots

721
01:17:08.08 --> 01:17:13.04
ring out from among the rocks and up from the slope bullets splattered against the boulders or

722
01:17:13.04 --> 01:17:19.20
shattered on small rocks on the ground unable to load another arrow light hair used his pistol again

723
01:17:19.20 --> 01:17:24.56
and another of the enemy went down light hair jumped from his horse to grab the hair of the dead

724
01:17:24.56 --> 01:17:30.24
enemy a quick swipe with his knife separated a patch of scalp as he ran toward a second body

725
01:17:30.24 --> 01:17:37.68
and grabbed another handful of hair a sharp smashing blow to his leg knocked him over he went down

726
01:17:37.68 --> 01:17:43.44
and a heap but hurly got to his feet shouts and gunfire continued bouncing off the boulders all

727
01:17:43.44 --> 01:17:49.52
around light hair went from boulder to boulder as gunfire waned and then he hobbled down the slope

728
01:17:50.96 --> 01:17:57.60
the fight was over every one of the enemies had been killed the Lakota rode among the rocks on the

729
01:17:57.60 --> 01:18:05.04
hill to make certain and then came down to gather around light hair most of them had seen him in the

730
01:18:05.04 --> 01:18:11.92
fight the bullets and arrows had not touched him except when he tried to take a second scalp

731
01:18:12.88 --> 01:18:19.68
his dream was true they decided high backbone took the scalps from him and cleaned the wound in his

732
01:18:19.68 --> 01:18:25.68
lower leg someone rounded up light hairs new horse and they all rode away from the hill a few

733
01:18:25.68 --> 01:18:34.72
scalps dangling from lances or belts horses and guns were the prize as well as the emergence

734
01:18:34.72 --> 01:18:41.92
of a new warrior among them that night around the fire the full impact of the battle settled

735
01:18:41.92 --> 01:18:51.76
in like an uninvited and unwelcome history men had been killed light hair killed two men

736
01:18:51.76 --> 01:18:57.20
the second and third human beings he had ever killed the first was the Omaha girl in the country

737
01:18:57.20 --> 01:19:07.04
far to the east three years past ghosts the old warrior say were the price of fighting man

738
01:19:07.04 --> 01:19:14.48
paid to follow the path of the warrior somewhere behind the noble and espalze traditions

739
01:19:14.48 --> 01:19:22.24
somewhere behind the achievements and the glory the ghosts waited and they would always be there

740
01:19:22.24 --> 01:19:30.000
their dying would forever be a part of the path of the man who took their lives whether the act

741
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:38.72
was honorable or justified or not their faces and often their dying moments could not be forgotten

742
01:19:38.72 --> 01:19:45.04
unless the heart of the warrior was made of stone and few could boast of that though many might have

743
01:19:45.04 --> 01:19:53.44
secretly wished it to be so somewhere people they didn't know wives and daughters mothers and grand

744
01:19:53.44 --> 01:19:59.44
daughters would mourn they would whale and gash themselves their hearts torn in anguish

745
01:20:00.96 --> 01:20:07.60
the path of the warrior was indeed strewn with broken hearts like so many stones on a long and

746
01:20:07.60 --> 01:20:17.12
winding trail the victory dances honored the warrior and the victory story stories reaffirmed

747
01:20:17.12 --> 01:20:23.52
the tradition of the warrior but very little if anything could chase away the dark men or

748
01:20:23.52 --> 01:20:31.04
memories that always lurked the ghost would always dull the edge of arrogance and bring a cold

749
01:20:31.04 --> 01:20:42.32
feeling at the most unexpected moments such was the price of being a warrior

750
01:20:48.64 --> 01:20:59.04
you know as you read not and you think about he gets dressed up for battle you know

751
01:20:59.04 --> 01:21:03.44
he's they're doing their war pain and it's part of a ritual that they're going through

752
01:21:05.04 --> 01:21:11.12
before they go into that and I think the ritual is probably really important to the human psyche

753
01:21:11.12 --> 01:21:17.44
to help you set aside some of the fear and the other things and maybe it might even help you with

754
01:21:17.44 --> 01:21:22.72
those ghosts a little bit remember on one of the early podcasts somebody asked if you had a

755
01:21:22.72 --> 01:21:29.84
ritual before you went out on ops and I think there is one that a lot of people practice and it was

756
01:21:29.84 --> 01:21:35.84
like I'm going to change out all my batteries I'm going to get all the old battle maps out of my

757
01:21:35.84 --> 01:21:39.84
gear and I'm going to put the new battle map and new comp plan and I'm going to go check my

758
01:21:39.84 --> 01:21:45.60
radio and then we have this ritual that develops it's it's like reinforcing that we're all getting

759
01:21:45.60 --> 01:21:48.80
ready to go out in the battlefield because they're like one of the last things we do before we get

760
01:21:48.80 --> 01:21:54.08
in the vehicles are getting the helicopters is we get together and we do comp checks we're saying

761
01:21:54.08 --> 01:21:59.36
to each other hey I want to make sure that you know that I can talk to you and then I know that

762
01:21:59.36 --> 01:22:06.40
you can talk to me and when you need help I'll hear you and I'll come right and that it's a different

763
01:22:06.40 --> 01:22:10.88
kind of ritual but it's actually kind of the same where we present ourselves for inspection

764
01:22:10.88 --> 01:22:16.16
from each other like hey check my gear out and all of us sometimes some platoons run differently

765
01:22:16.16 --> 01:22:24.000
where they'll have one guy check it out but every platoon has a system where you present yourself

766
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.56
and you do all these this ritual to get ready to go into combat and then you present yourself to

767
01:22:28.56 --> 01:22:35.84
your your teammate like hey check me out make sure I'm screwed away and and then I'll check you out

768
01:22:36.64 --> 01:22:41.60
and then we're in that we're kind of reaffirming all of our bonds and getting ready to go

769
01:22:41.60 --> 01:22:51.60
into the belly of the beast yeah it's probably worth noting as a leader to make that a little

770
01:22:51.60 --> 01:22:58.08
bit more ritualistic right so what can you do to make it a little bit more ritualistic and

771
01:22:58.08 --> 01:23:04.72
I did this my first deployment to Iraq where we would before we'd get in the vehicles it was

772
01:23:04.72 --> 01:23:08.72
world roll call like we would stand like we'd all stand around the board with the vehicles

773
01:23:08.72 --> 01:23:14.56
on it and it was you know gardener you know willing air you know just going through

774
01:23:15.20 --> 01:23:20.56
that roll call that yep we're all here we all know what vehicles were in this is just going out tonight

775
01:23:20.96 --> 01:23:29.76
and we for some reason in in in Rmadi we didn't do quite that ritualistic roll call

776
01:23:31.04 --> 01:23:36.56
we had come up with a more decentralized system for yep everyone's good to go you know

777
01:23:36.56 --> 01:23:41.28
probably just the vehicles you know one you know six up five's up four's up three's up two's up one

778
01:23:41.28 --> 01:23:46.80
we're good to go we don't need to have everyone stand around but as you're talking through this

779
01:23:46.80 --> 01:23:55.84
that little nice little ritual was a good thing and it gives you a you know I now've talked

780
01:23:55.84 --> 01:24:01.36
about this before the fact that in America we don't really have a ritualistic solid ritualistic

781
01:24:01.36 --> 01:24:08.56
to wait to deal with death there's not a protocol to follow of what you're supposed to do

782
01:24:08.56 --> 01:24:14.56
and it and it can I think leave a lot of open ends and a lot of loose strings because other

783
01:24:14.56 --> 01:24:20.56
cultures have hey this day we're going to do this kind of celebration we're going to say this prayer

784
01:24:20.56 --> 01:24:26.64
we're going to go to this place we're going to do this thing and then it's over it doesn't make

785
01:24:26.64 --> 01:24:32.16
any sense does it because dying is as natural as being born yeah and why don't we

786
01:24:33.28 --> 01:24:39.36
like it's just like this weird gap that we have where we haven't set up this away for us to just

787
01:24:39.36 --> 01:24:45.92
cope with it yeah and and and even you know we have some rituals like in the sealed teams like

788
01:24:45.92 --> 01:24:49.44
okay we're going to go to the funeral we're going to we're going to put the tried it you know

789
01:24:49.44 --> 01:24:54.16
we're going to pound our tridents into the casket like those are awesome things but it's almost like

790
01:24:54.16 --> 01:25:00.16
the ritual we need to have completion where you say hey once you put that tried it in the

791
01:25:00.16 --> 01:25:10.16
casket and you bury that casket you know now you've you've let that part of of that warrior go

792
01:25:10.16 --> 01:25:16.80
and now you can move forward whatever the saying should be or whatever the the ritual because

793
01:25:16.80 --> 01:25:21.20
you don't really know that you know no one said like hey man once you do that it's okay you've

794
01:25:21.20 --> 01:25:27.68
given you've given that warrior the the most respect you can give me you've given him him

795
01:25:28.24 --> 01:25:32.96
the most meaningful thing to you which is your trident you've given it to him you're going to

796
01:25:32.96 --> 01:25:39.20
bury him with your trident you're going to be with him forever and now you go back to doing your

797
01:25:39.20 --> 01:25:46.24
job I kind of feel that way you know I felt some level of closure when I've done that but

798
01:25:46.24 --> 01:25:54.24
if it was a little bit more if it was a little bit more codified it might be even more healthy

799
01:25:54.24 --> 01:26:00.40
for guys so I think the idea of rituals are so helpful in everyday life you know if you've

800
01:26:00.40 --> 01:26:03.84
got some rituals to follow me people have all kinds of little rituals they follow in everyday life

801
01:26:03.84 --> 01:26:09.44
right and get up I brush my teeth you know I do a certain I put on like I wear the same clothes all

802
01:26:09.44 --> 01:26:12.64
time to work out you know I mean I have these little rituals and I pretty much wear the same clothes

803
01:26:12.64 --> 01:26:18.16
every day by the way but you got these rituals like this is what I'm going to do and it makes

804
01:26:18.72 --> 01:26:29.52
things easier and it allows your mind to sort of follow a of a path that that is already known

805
01:26:30.24 --> 01:26:34.80
and I think that's really healthy and I think that would help people a lot you know

806
01:26:34.80 --> 01:26:39.68
it and it's what's what's so cool what's so cool is getting these windows and what's really cool

807
01:26:39.68 --> 01:26:45.52
about the story of crazy horses it was written by a Lakota and then we get a window into their

808
01:26:45.52 --> 01:26:51.84
culture it's not that much different than ours we'd grief they're talking about that their

809
01:26:51.84 --> 01:26:58.56
virtues are generosity and courage I think we see that as a virtue too right they come back

810
01:26:58.56 --> 01:27:05.12
from more they have PTSD by the way yes and so as they're talking about the things that these are

811
01:27:05.12 --> 01:27:13.60
holding up as high standards or things that we hold up as high standards as well yeah it's worth

812
01:27:13.60 --> 01:27:18.88
if you're if you're in a leadership position of the more ritual you can establish without getting

813
01:27:18.88 --> 01:27:23.68
crazy you know without getting crazy we don't know create rituals for no reason we also want to

814
01:27:23.68 --> 01:27:31.84
create rituals that become um constructive but putting some rituals in place is a positive thing

815
01:27:31.84 --> 01:27:41.76
definitely speaking of rituals that night there was a victory dance high backbone and the others

816
01:27:41.76 --> 01:27:46.000
described the battle and their parts in it for enemy warriors had been killed and by the way they were

817
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.12
fine I didn't I did a bad job they were fighting against uh same snakes yeah it was snakes that

818
01:27:51.12 --> 01:27:57.68
they were fighting against snake tribe for enemy warriors had been killed guns and horses had been

819
01:27:57.68 --> 01:28:03.04
captured everyone waited for the son of crazy horse to tell of his deeds since according to the

820
01:28:03.04 --> 01:28:08.80
other men he had turned the flow of the battle but the boy hung back reluctant to talk

821
01:28:10.64 --> 01:28:19.92
waning with humility he goes asleep fast forward a little bit the son was high when he

822
01:28:19.92 --> 01:28:25.20
finally roused himself the pain in his leg had diminished somewhat and he managed to doze off a little

823
01:28:25.20 --> 01:28:29.84
he sipped he from the horn cup someone had left by the fire pit and finally dressed he stepped out

824
01:28:29.84 --> 01:28:34.80
from the lodge and was surprised to see a crowd gathered in the camp circle at the edge of

825
01:28:35.52 --> 01:28:41.04
it stood his father wearing his best medicine robe decorated with long strands of horse hair

826
01:28:43.12 --> 01:28:50.64
a trilling arose among the women his mother stood behind his father gentle smiles on their faces

827
01:28:50.64 --> 01:28:56.40
and unmasked pride as well crazy horse lifted his voice in a warrior's honoring song joined

828
01:28:56.40 --> 01:29:02.72
by his wives and light hairs sister after the song came more shouts and war hoops and trilling

829
01:29:03.44 --> 01:29:10.000
crazy horse lifted his hand and walked forward and faced the crowd I give my first son a new name

830
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:16.80
this day he said raising his voice I have heard the story of the brave things he did I am proud

831
01:29:16.80 --> 01:29:23.60
his mothers are proud all of his family and friends are proud of our young man so this day I

832
01:29:23.60 --> 01:29:30.80
give him a new name I give him the name of his father and his fathers before him from this day

833
01:29:30.80 --> 01:29:39.84
forward I call him crazy horse from somewhere in the crowd a drum pounded and another honoring song

834
01:29:39.84 --> 01:29:46.80
was raised and the crowd surged forward high backbone little hawk he dog and lone bear were among the

835
01:29:46.80 --> 01:29:55.12
many who came forward smiling crazy horse the name flowed like water over the rocks

836
01:30:00.80 --> 01:30:04.80
there's a little ritual activity that was a whole scene I'm looking to get out staying

837
01:30:04.80 --> 01:30:13.20
welcome into the club man and this is equally awesome or at least get in close so the father

838
01:30:13.20 --> 01:30:24.24
passed on the name and took for himself another worm a name of utmost humility in time even that

839
01:30:24.24 --> 01:30:32.40
name would have meaning for he would be known as worm the father of crazy horse is like epic

840
01:30:32.40 --> 01:30:38.72
use gay is call me worm that's where we're at that's the humility level happening around here

841
01:30:39.68 --> 01:30:46.24
hey echo can I ask you about a movie yes of course good fellas yes there's that scene where

842
01:30:46.96 --> 01:30:53.20
the main character goes to jail and he's just locked up for a little time but he doesn't say anything

843
01:30:53.20 --> 01:31:00.16
and then when he gets let's let out everybody's yeah yeah when he was a kid that's when he's a kid

844
01:31:00.16 --> 01:31:10.16
pop your chair yeah yeah good good scene yeah there's something about that this is another thing we

845
01:31:10.16 --> 01:31:20.000
don't do great in America you're a man now type thing that ceremony that thing you're a woman now

846
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.84
you can see they did it for for both black buffalo woman and you know like okay this is it

847
01:31:25.84 --> 01:31:34.40
you're you're responsible now we don't do a great job of that I went through something like that

848
01:31:34.40 --> 01:31:39.76
in the Catholic Church where I did confirmation and and and so different cultures have got it

849
01:31:39.76 --> 01:31:44.64
but as it has we've kind of morphed away from that it's something that we've lost so how do we

850
01:31:45.36 --> 01:31:51.28
how do we replace it and in a way it's got to be something that you earn right it's so much better

851
01:31:51.28 --> 01:31:56.88
if you're earning for sure for sure it shouldn't just be like okay time and rate you turned

852
01:31:57.60 --> 01:32:04.96
you turned seven you're a man now yeah isn't graduating high school kind of like that though yeah true

853
01:32:04.96 --> 01:32:09.68
I mean I guess in certain families right but you graduate high school they give you like a bunch of

854
01:32:09.68 --> 01:32:14.88
stuff and then your uncle or whoever gives you like advice it's like an actual thing

855
01:32:14.88 --> 01:32:21.20
I do lose a podcast on advice you got from your uncle when you graduated high school became a man

856
01:32:21.20 --> 01:32:26.96
bro that might be a whole podcast series I'm just saying you know you well oh you didn't get

857
01:32:26.96 --> 01:32:31.04
advice from your uncle no sir oh not me I'm just saying you have a lot of extended family or I'm

858
01:32:31.04 --> 01:32:36.48
grown up oh no no not really and I didn't either but that's like some people doing that's a

859
01:32:36.48 --> 01:32:40.72
great benefit because then there's all these adults putting good stuff into the kids here so like

860
01:32:40.72 --> 01:32:46.16
they you read in this book where there's everybody's talking so everything's kind of common knowledge

861
01:32:46.16 --> 01:32:54.000
and everybody's involved in developing well one of the things uh in Hawaii it's very common to call

862
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:58.96
like if you ever respected family friend or friends that come around you call them uncle or

863
01:32:58.96 --> 01:33:03.52
a handy hundred percent like I didn't even know uncle was my mom and dad's brother sister or

864
01:33:03.52 --> 01:33:08.96
I'm gonna just like I didn't know that and so like in the do it yeah yeah but it's it feels more

865
01:33:08.96 --> 01:33:15.44
solidified in Hawaii because like I was like 10 maybe 11 before I realized oh wait like uncle is like

866
01:33:15.44 --> 01:33:20.40
if you're actually related to them yeah you just call there's people now even that I still call

867
01:33:20.40 --> 01:33:26.48
uncle Jill uncle whatever like you can't help it but um yeah so I mean it's in a way it's kind of

868
01:33:26.48 --> 01:33:29.84
this kind of same thing yeah when you go grab when you graduate they're all there and they give you

869
01:33:29.84 --> 01:33:34.48
you know all the stuff I get I got my lunch I got put and check on that stuff by my wife

870
01:33:34.48 --> 01:33:41.68
but because when I saw them it was like six and I was treating like a team guy and my wife's like

871
01:33:41.68 --> 01:33:47.68
he's taking six and he's like oh like well still it should still be up to three you know

872
01:33:48.80 --> 01:33:54.96
she just had like crushed me and I was just really sorry about that I mean you know you have to be

873
01:33:54.96 --> 01:34:00.000
smart enough to listen I had to think through it I had to think through it and I was like well

874
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:07.44
wait a second when I was seven I realized I was like oh my god I'm an idiot because I was thinking

875
01:34:07.44 --> 01:34:11.28
you know why would you not just do you know why would you not get up at four in the morning

876
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:18.16
and I'm like bro was I when I was seven I didn't even have any concept of any of that you know

877
01:34:18.16 --> 01:34:24.000
there was a little boy and there was looking at my kid like you better get up to sleep yeah

878
01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:31.52
don't you want to talk to you what you this candle bills for you son as you can't respond

879
01:34:31.52 --> 01:34:38.48
because you can't talk yet you know little kids have blankets did any of your

880
01:34:38.48 --> 01:34:46.72
junior kids have a blanket yeah my mom that's a big thing with my mom's she got the kids

881
01:34:46.72 --> 01:34:51.84
their special blanket and but it it wasn't like a security thing or not okay so one of my

882
01:34:51.84 --> 01:34:57.52
kid I think my um second daughter had like a blanket that went with her everywhere my first daughter

883
01:34:57.52 --> 01:35:06.08
not so much I didn't know what was gonna happen with my son so so I got him like this old school

884
01:35:06.08 --> 01:35:11.52
like S.A.S. Freaking scarf thing and I was like if you need to blink it's gonna be freaking

885
01:35:11.52 --> 01:35:19.04
tactical you know what he rejected he never had a he never had like that that uh he never utilized it

886
01:35:19.04 --> 01:35:26.64
really yeah well no no he was my one of my daughter that had the blanket that really

887
01:35:26.64 --> 01:35:32.80
carried it everywhere it was what is it called knitted it was knitted it had kind of like big

888
01:35:33.36 --> 01:35:39.68
croissants had big knots so you could kind of he should constantly be uh fumbling with them right

889
01:35:39.68 --> 01:35:44.24
more like so yeah so but and the S.A.S. thing kind of had some little things that said you know that'll

890
01:35:44.24 --> 01:35:48.56
be you know helps the dexterity or work on dexterity young age you want to be working

891
01:35:48.56 --> 01:35:56.48
your grip strength so in my life like you are such a wrecking idiot so there you go yeah but he was

892
01:35:56.48 --> 01:36:01.76
definitely your son from straight away because I remember him coming over early on and I had like a

893
01:36:01.76 --> 01:36:07.68
hatchet laying around and you're like my you can't have that hatchet he had he'd already grabbed

894
01:36:07.68 --> 01:36:12.32
and he got it from a real quick right before our pop belly picked right to eat him.

895
01:36:12.32 --> 01:36:18.96
My favorite cameo we saw one of our old neighbors a great friends of the family great great

896
01:36:18.96 --> 01:36:23.20
people and they were like yeah we were looking through pictures the other day and he had a picture

900
01:36:46.56 --> 01:36:56.56
about to get crucified twisted times okay going back to the book there there's a they're doing a

901
01:36:56.56 --> 01:37:01.36
raid once again on the snakes you know to your point Jason this is what they were doing

902
01:37:01.36 --> 01:37:07.52
yeah it's not like all the all the the Indians were out there comb by odd just you know living in

903
01:37:07.52 --> 01:37:13.76
peace and harmony they were killing each other and that's what's going on here um they got a raid

904
01:37:13.76 --> 01:37:19.20
they're on a raid on the snakes it's going sideways crazy horse found good cover boots soon surrounded

905
01:37:19.20 --> 01:37:23.60
and his horse had been captured incoming fire prevented him from reloading his rifle without a

906
01:37:23.60 --> 01:37:28.88
horse his odds of survival were greatly reduced his best chance was to move out of harm's way but he

907
01:37:28.88 --> 01:37:34.64
knew he had that quickly the sound of distant gunfire was growing fainer meaning the herd of new

908
01:37:34.64 --> 01:37:40.40
Lakota horses and most of the raiders were now well to the north he and a few of the other Lakota's

909
01:37:40.40 --> 01:37:47.20
in the trees were left on their own with more snakes arriving moving from tree to tree he waited

910
01:37:47.20 --> 01:37:53.20
for a snake warrior to pass close and jump behind him onto the horse dispatching the man with one

911
01:37:53.20 --> 01:38:04.48
swing of his stone headed war club do any commentary on that besides us yeah how are you

912
01:38:04.48 --> 01:38:11.20
jumping onto the horse that's just like athletic prowess as well pulling out his pistol the

913
01:38:11.20 --> 01:38:16.000
open fire to distract the snake circling outside the trees and shouted for the Lakota to make

914
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.68
their escape making the break from the trees crazy horse and his companions gained a good head start

915
01:38:21.68 --> 01:38:26.48
before the snakes could regroup the snakes continued to pursue the herd and at one point managed

916
01:38:26.48 --> 01:38:32.96
to recover a few of their horses but they had lost several more men and soon disengaged never in

917
01:38:32.96 --> 01:38:39.44
recent memory had the Ogilawla Lakota taken so many horses in one raid but they had suffered

918
01:38:39.44 --> 01:38:46.000
losses as well with at least five men killed victory stories abounded and the dances went far

919
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:51.04
into the night the Lakota learned that one of the snake casualties was the son of their head man

920
01:38:51.68 --> 01:38:58.56
the young man had been one of the first to pursue the Lakota once more young crazy horse did not

921
01:38:58.56 --> 01:39:04.16
participate in the dancing in fact he said nothing even to his father about the new horse he was

922
01:39:04.16 --> 01:39:10.80
riding or the new muzzle loaded loading rifle he had brought back warm could only guess how is

923
01:39:10.80 --> 01:39:15.68
son of the choir them until one of crazy horses companions who had been in the trees surrounded

924
01:39:15.68 --> 01:39:22.24
by the snakes told him what he had witnessed that the young man had unhorsed the snake and

925
01:39:22.24 --> 01:39:28.32
captured the gun in one daring moment his action had saved them all the man was certain

926
01:39:32.88 --> 01:39:41.60
this is just a good methodology for life if you talk about how awesome you are you're degrading

927
01:39:41.60 --> 01:39:53.52
your level of respect as a human so just don't do it it's just better just to not say anything

928
01:39:53.52 --> 01:40:00.08
awesome is that is this situation because crazy horse just rolls back in with a brand new horse

929
01:40:00.08 --> 01:40:05.44
a brand new rifle and doesn't even tell us that that he did this thing and he has to hear it second hand

930
01:40:05.44 --> 01:40:17.28
12 years of one-on-one instruction provided by provided any Lakota male the basic physical skills

931
01:40:17.28 --> 01:40:22.40
to be a fighting man by the age of 15 or 16 any boy was proficient with all of his weapons

932
01:40:22.40 --> 01:40:27.68
but unseen factors determined how each would be warrior would handle live combat

933
01:40:28.56 --> 01:40:34.32
after the first few encounters with enemies on the battlefield young crazy horse had demonstrated

934
01:40:34.32 --> 01:40:40.56
qualities that he looted many men for an entire lifetime older experienced men while initially

935
01:40:40.56 --> 01:40:47.12
impressed waited to pass judgment however it was not usual for young men to perform well in their

936
01:40:47.12 --> 01:40:52.64
first face to face encounters with enemies if for no other reason then that their inexperienced

937
01:40:52.64 --> 01:40:58.24
made them less cautious then the daunting realities of combat became part of their thinking

938
01:40:58.24 --> 01:41:03.04
and the same young men who seemed so daring and reckless and their first few outings hesitated

939
01:41:03.04 --> 01:41:09.28
taking stock before taking action caution was good it turned reckless boys into thinking man and a

940
01:41:09.28 --> 01:41:15.12
thinking man was overall more valuable on the battlefield than one who placed others in danger

941
01:41:15.12 --> 01:41:22.48
because he took unnecessary risks so the old man who heard so the old man who heard of the first

942
01:41:22.48 --> 01:41:28.48
exploits of young crazy horse not at knowingly remembering that such and such had started the same

943
01:41:28.48 --> 01:41:35.04
way and now he was a man with a family because there was little more to life than glory on the battlefield

944
01:41:36.88 --> 01:41:43.60
some wisdom from these from these folks they know what's up the reckless

945
01:41:43.60 --> 01:41:48.80
die young the old men advised and their only legacy is a brief moment of glory but it's over time

946
01:41:48.80 --> 01:41:54.64
it's forgotten it is the steady and the steadfast that prevail the old one say so while it's

947
01:41:54.64 --> 01:42:00.56
started the heart and the imagination to hear of the exploits of a new young warrior one whose quiet

948
01:42:00.56 --> 01:42:05.52
ways and camp contradicted the stories of daring on the battlefield the old men puffed on their

949
01:42:05.52 --> 01:42:12.40
pipes as they sat around the evening fires and not at knowingly over time young crazy horse

950
01:42:12.40 --> 01:42:21.12
would give up his reckless ways they said everyone does not quiet everyone

951
01:42:21.12 --> 01:42:29.92
meanwhile the lines of suitors at the lodge of black buffalo woman were as long as ever

952
01:42:31.12 --> 01:42:40.40
she's square it away and the town or the village is kind of taking notice at time went by

953
01:42:40.40 --> 01:42:45.52
even the staunch of skeptics agreed that black buffalo woman and the stalwart young crazy horse

954
01:42:45.52 --> 01:42:48.72
were a good match and that she would do well to bring such a man into her family

955
01:42:48.72 --> 01:42:54.96
but there were still many whispers behind the hand that her family had plans that didn't take

956
01:42:55.92 --> 01:43:01.60
the girl's own feelings into consideration one of the suitors was no water

957
01:43:02.48 --> 01:43:09.44
who of his own accord was by no was no comparison to crazy horse but no water's older brother

958
01:43:09.44 --> 01:43:16.40
black twin was a skilled orator and a man of growing influence and he held many opinions

959
01:43:16.40 --> 01:43:21.92
solidly in line with those of red cloud so no water was suddenly a valuable man

960
01:43:22.80 --> 01:43:26.64
there was nothing for anyone to do but wait and watch with great interest

961
01:43:27.92 --> 01:43:32.64
has to what would happen so you got crazy horse he's sort of the

962
01:43:33.68 --> 01:43:39.84
he's like the warrior in this scenario and then no water who has a little bit of prestige

963
01:43:39.84 --> 01:43:45.60
some family connections and there's a there's a mystery as to what's going to happen and who's going to end up

964
01:43:47.68 --> 01:43:49.60
getting black buffalo woman

965
01:43:52.40 --> 01:43:56.56
going out the field again scouts from one of the camps along the powder river met the returning

966
01:43:56.56 --> 01:44:02.000
warriors and were quickly sent back to spread the news of success but before he left

967
01:44:04.16 --> 01:44:09.12
one of the scouts let slip a bit of news from the red cloud camp that was like an arrow into the

968
01:44:09.12 --> 01:44:15.92
heart of young crazy horse no water the younger brother of black twin had become the husband

969
01:44:15.92 --> 01:44:23.84
of black buffalo woman out on deployment and he was supposed to go on that deployment and

970
01:44:23.84 --> 01:44:29.12
suddenly got it two things yeah he got a two thing all about to the camp and then even Mary

971
01:44:29.12 --> 01:44:34.24
black buffalo woman dirty trick joddy always there a stain in camp yeah

972
01:44:34.24 --> 01:44:42.48
uh the grain of hope that light hair dared to allow himself hold to hold in his heart

973
01:44:42.48 --> 01:44:48.40
had grown into distinct possibility when as crazy horse he joined a line of y'all of hopefully

974
01:44:48.40 --> 01:44:53.20
young men waiting outside the girls lodge that grain of hope had grown even more each time she stood

975
01:44:53.20 --> 01:44:59.36
with him under his courting robe and seemed reluctant to leave his embrace or perhaps it was only

976
01:44:59.36 --> 01:45:06.56
as imagination this would not be the first time imagination totally ignored his imagination totally

977
01:45:06.56 --> 01:45:15.28
ignored the boundaries and limits of reality so he's gets heartbroken half a month later you return

978
01:45:15.28 --> 01:45:22.000
fast forward a little bit uh crazy horse said nothing of the trail he had traveled for nearly

979
01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:27.84
a month that for nearly half a month warm new that the broken heart was not completely healed

980
01:45:27.84 --> 01:45:34.16
the perhaps never would be but he knew as all fathers do that sometimes the best medicine for

981
01:45:34.16 --> 01:45:39.76
such a wound was life itself some good advice right there yeah because he'd left he'd gone out

982
01:45:39.76 --> 01:45:47.20
kind of just on his own for a few weeks to get get over the the heartbreak you know's a little bit

983
01:45:47.20 --> 01:45:52.96
of rating all one is out of two yeah just just just some little operations

984
01:45:52.96 --> 01:46:01.60
up um more good comments here a wound on the outside can be watched to see that it heals

985
01:46:01.60 --> 01:46:07.76
well as everyone knew wounds on the on inside could not be seen but for pain in the eyes

986
01:46:07.76 --> 01:46:13.12
several months had passed since black buffalo woman had taken no waters or husband soon after they

987
01:46:13.12 --> 01:46:20.08
had moved away for as everyone knew no water was afraid of crazy horse the old women knew

988
01:46:20.08 --> 01:46:26.48
that best of all but if they're young man as they called crazy horse bore any ill will it could

989
01:46:26.48 --> 01:46:31.92
not be seen in the way he conducted himself or heard in any words he had spoken so they hoped

990
01:46:31.92 --> 01:46:38.24
that the wound inflicted by black buffalo woman was healed though some didn't blame her she was

991
01:46:38.24 --> 01:46:43.84
after all only 16 and how could one so young stand up to the powerful ambitions of her father

992
01:46:43.84 --> 01:46:54.24
and uncle um rolling into the back and one of the reflections sections here and and again um

993
01:46:54.72 --> 01:47:02.000
skipping a bunch of stuff um but wanted to talk about this part where he says where Marshall says

994
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:07.20
the seeking of a vision is a serious highly ritualized process undertaken respectfully

995
01:47:07.20 --> 01:47:12.16
prayerfully and under the guidance of a medicine man to seek a vision is to seek guidance for

996
01:47:12.16 --> 01:47:17.68
one's life or to answer a problem or predicament young light hair was probably afraid that the

997
01:47:17.68 --> 01:47:24.64
dream he had that night he spent a top of sandstone but but but would not be taken seriously

998
01:47:25.60 --> 01:47:31.76
because he had not followed all the rules but it came nonetheless the dream that vision has been

999
01:47:31.76 --> 01:47:36.72
told and retold thousands of times since the fact of the matter is that we cannot be certain of the

1000
01:47:36.72 --> 01:47:41.44
exact description of light hair that light hair later gave to his father further more

1001
01:47:41.44 --> 01:47:46.56
discrradical to understand that much of the discussion and interpretation of the vision has occurred

1002
01:47:46.56 --> 01:47:52.80
and is still occurring since crazy horse death there are those who see the vision as a foretelling

1003
01:47:52.80 --> 01:47:57.52
almost a blow by blow revelation of what lay ahead for light hair it depicts an powerful

1004
01:47:57.52 --> 01:48:01.76
locata warrior rising out of the lake during a thunderstorm on a horse that changes colors

1005
01:48:01.76 --> 01:48:05.76
riding on skewed through a hail of arrows and bullets until he's eventually pulled down by his

1006
01:48:05.76 --> 01:48:13.52
own kind grabbing and holding back his arms the vision might have been as much a consequence of

1007
01:48:13.52 --> 01:48:18.56
wishful thinking as it is a glimpse into the future for every locata boy grew up with dreams of

1008
01:48:18.56 --> 01:48:23.36
being a warrior and winning glory and honor on the battlefield light hair was no different one

1009
01:48:23.36 --> 01:48:29.04
elderly locata story teller was the opinion that light hair and his father chose not to tell

1010
01:48:29.04 --> 01:48:34.96
everything about the vision speculating that a warning was part of it a warning that the boy would

1011
01:48:34.96 --> 01:48:41.12
die as a young man in his prime such a warning could explain crazy horses daring and often

1012
01:48:41.12 --> 01:48:48.16
reckless exploits in combat as a younger fighting man perhaps he believed each time he was about

1013
01:48:48.16 --> 01:48:52.96
to perform the last act of his life and wanted to be powerful and meaningful

1014
01:48:54.96 --> 01:49:00.16
now man the guy's got a broken heart at this point and essentially like they're talking about

1015
01:49:00.16 --> 01:49:07.04
these other warriors get a family in that now they got something to lose and crazy horse doesn't

1016
01:49:07.76 --> 01:49:12.48
it's like the classic but I don't want to take that take that away from his courage or bravery

1017
01:49:12.48 --> 01:49:18.08
or anything else either yeah the classic you know team guy on the ragged edge with nothing

1018
01:49:18.08 --> 01:49:29.20
to lose so I have that's like hey ready to go getting back into the story crazy horse decided to see

1019
01:49:29.20 --> 01:49:35.76
for himself how things were at for laryming he found a loafer camp which is these are like

1020
01:49:35.76 --> 01:49:39.92
Indian camps that are right outside and they're friendly with the whites and make deals with the

1021
01:49:39.92 --> 01:49:43.28
whites and they kind of live off the whites they're all loafers he found a loafer camp a short

1022
01:49:43.28 --> 01:49:49.36
way from the fort and stayed with them a few days to hear what they knew a newbies were laid again

1023
01:49:49.36 --> 01:49:54.96
they complained and the long horn cattle were skinnier every year they noticed not without

1024
01:49:54.96 --> 01:50:00.000
some degree of envy that while crazy horse carried a rifle and a pistol and a far-seeing glass

1025
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:06.16
he was not dressed in white man's clothes as they were he reminded them he was a hunter

1026
01:50:06.96 --> 01:50:12.48
though some of them took this remark as an insult others knew that living off the promises

1027
01:50:12.48 --> 01:50:22.16
of the annuities was not really living but white man named burdo could speak locota very well

1028
01:50:22.16 --> 01:50:27.04
and he was surprised to see someone from the northern camps among the loafers he told crazy horse

1029
01:50:27.04 --> 01:50:33.12
that more soldiers were coming to be posted at laryme he knew this because the whites had a way of

1030
01:50:33.12 --> 01:50:38.32
talking over great distances that much much faster than letters carried by stage coaches

1031
01:50:38.32 --> 01:50:44.000
and the pony riders they had a tapping language which by which they sent messages along a

1032
01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.84
wire faster than even the prairie falcon could fly

1033
01:50:55.36 --> 01:51:00.56
now what starts happening is there's there's they start a fine gold look for gold discover gold

1034
01:51:00.56 --> 01:51:11.28
and there's people heading north of elk river to find gold north of the shell river and these are

1035
01:51:12.24 --> 01:51:20.40
super intrusive right and here we go after several days travel north of shell river the

1036
01:51:20.40 --> 01:51:27.44
people in the gold seeking train woke a woke to an unexpected sight they were surrounded by hundreds

1037
01:51:27.44 --> 01:51:36.08
of mounted locota and sci-yella fighting men positioned on the hills and ridges around them

1038
01:51:36.08 --> 01:51:41.68
the trail north and south was blocked the blockators stayed out of rifle range and didn't

1039
01:51:41.68 --> 01:51:46.72
make any aggressive moves simply maintaining their positions as the day wore on a ring of men

1040
01:51:46.72 --> 01:51:52.88
and horses seeming to have risen out of the rocks after nightfall a ring of small fires burned

1041
01:51:52.88 --> 01:51:59.52
morning light revealed the blockators were still in place days and nights passed into five and then

1042
01:51:59.52 --> 01:52:09.60
six so these these these big train wagon train is up looking for gold and the the Indians

1043
01:52:10.16 --> 01:52:17.04
team up they team up and they surround them super strategic what they're doing

1044
01:52:17.04 --> 01:52:22.32
super strategic because they're not they're not but they're not killing all the women and children

1045
01:52:22.32 --> 01:52:29.36
is which is going to commit everybody to something they're just like hey and I'm sure those people

1046
01:52:29.36 --> 01:52:36.64
must have been horrified horrified he says here there are only two ways for the whites to go

1047
01:52:36.64 --> 01:52:41.60
continue north of return south if the soldiers came and tried to take gold seekers north

1048
01:52:41.60 --> 01:52:47.84
but locota and sci-yella what attack it was decided if they turned back south they would be

1049
01:52:47.84 --> 01:52:53.36
allowed to return hopefully with knowledge that powder river country would not be another trail

1050
01:52:53.36 --> 01:53:01.52
for the whites whatever their purpose or destination and then some soldiers come and thankfully

1051
01:53:01.52 --> 01:53:07.36
they turn they turn the train south and this is what I think is an important piece crazy horse

1052
01:53:07.36 --> 01:53:12.000
would always remember the strange episode on the snake steak to trail especially in light of

1053
01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:17.76
what all that was to follow he carried a lesson from it that he would use as a measure every time

1054
01:53:17.76 --> 01:53:22.88
he looked to the trails a fighting man all the warriors on the ridges surrounding the gold

1055
01:53:22.88 --> 01:53:29.04
seekers had invoked a feeling of virtue of simply coming together a feeling of strength that

1056
01:53:29.04 --> 01:53:37.84
comes from pursuing the same purpose several hundred had responded some from the Sahelia and perhaps

1057
01:53:37.84 --> 01:53:44.48
a few blue clouds married into locota families he knew several by name but most were unknown to him

1058
01:53:45.12 --> 01:53:52.08
on those windstrap wind swept ridges for six days however they had shared the kinship of purpose

1059
01:53:52.08 --> 01:54:00.32
so incredibly in person important lesson for him unifying people and working together towards a common goal

1060
01:54:01.76 --> 01:54:07.36
that's an opportunity yeah and and so when people feel like they're part of the group

1061
01:54:10.16 --> 01:54:17.60
they're capable of so much more and so that means that no matter what you do make sure

1062
01:54:17.60 --> 01:54:23.04
that everybody feels included on the team it's that easy I have a simple statement about this

1063
01:54:23.04 --> 01:54:28.32
together we are stronger and if you can keep that in mind it's it actually is like it's covered

1064
01:54:28.32 --> 01:54:33.04
move because with cover move you get to far apart now we can't cover move for each other together

1065
01:54:33.04 --> 01:54:36.64
we are stronger if you keep that in mind whenever things are happening think a together we're

1066
01:54:36.64 --> 01:54:43.68
stronger that's the way you want to go and that's the lesson he learned here fast forward a little

1067
01:54:43.68 --> 01:54:48.32
bit summer past lazily and people talked about making presence to the buffalo scouts and sending

1068
01:54:48.32 --> 01:54:55.60
them out looking so the so the planning for the autumn hunts could be made as the first heavy

1069
01:54:55.60 --> 01:55:04.16
snow's fell troubling news came from far south from the sajilia who lived along the southern fork

1070
01:55:04.16 --> 01:55:10.72
of the shell river soldiers it was always the soldiers 300 people had been killed at a place called

1071
01:55:10.72 --> 01:55:17.44
sand creek most of them sajila and some blue clouds led by black kettle and white antelope

1072
01:55:18.48 --> 01:55:23.92
both leaders were regarded as wise and always working for peace the killing was bad enough because

1073
01:55:23.92 --> 01:55:28.96
those killed were mostly women and children but the soldiers who attacked did more than kill

1074
01:55:30.24 --> 01:55:36.40
the white agent trusted by black kettle and white antelope had advised them to find a place to

1075
01:55:36.40 --> 01:55:42.08
pitch their lodges that was away from the main trails it was told there were many whites in that

1076
01:55:42.08 --> 01:55:48.08
part of the country many living in a large town called Denver and there was a hatred among them

1077
01:55:48.72 --> 01:55:56.88
for the sajila and people of the earth the camp was to fly the white banner of peace as well as

1078
01:55:56.88 --> 01:56:03.68
the striped banner of the long knives to signify they were peaceful but the soldiers found them

1079
01:56:03.68 --> 01:56:10.08
and the banners meant nothing the messengers could barely tell the story trying to keep back the

1080
01:56:10.08 --> 01:56:15.12
anger and the tears as well as the bile that rose in the throat for remembering women and children

1081
01:56:15.12 --> 01:56:20.000
were butchered after they were killed it was told parts of their bodies were cut away such as a

1082
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:26.000
woman's breasts and genitalia's a child's hand or fingers and boys genitalia's

1083
01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:35.12
brains were bashed out with gun stocks and eyes were gouged out some babies not yet burned

1084
01:56:35.12 --> 01:56:40.96
born were cut from their mother's stomachs the final insult came when the soldiers attached

1085
01:56:40.96 --> 01:56:46.24
body parts to their blue coats and rode in a victory march through the streets of the large

1086
01:56:46.24 --> 01:56:53.68
town as the other whites cheered the Lakota did not want to believe the news not because they

1087
01:56:53.68 --> 01:57:00.24
wanted to deny the truth of it but because it was much too difficult to believe that anyone could do

1088
01:57:00.24 --> 01:57:05.20
such unspeakable deeds

1089
01:57:08.48 --> 01:57:13.84
sancryk masker um i did a podcast about that with

1090
01:57:15.12 --> 01:57:21.52
denyeli beleli and derral kuper we we talked about the mili masker in the sancryk masker and it's

1091
01:57:21.52 --> 01:57:32.48
just a freaking nightmare all the whites were not worthy enemy now and that thought was

1092
01:57:32.48 --> 01:57:39.28
carried with guns, lances, war clubs and bows as angry men rode out from the great camp

1093
01:57:39.28 --> 01:57:46.40
the Lakota swept to the northeast the sahelia to the northwest and the blue clouds swirled

1094
01:57:46.40 --> 01:57:55.12
like hornets in between, waystations soldier soldier posts and tra- any travelers along the

1095
01:57:55.12 --> 01:58:00.88
holy road or any frequented by whites were the objectives young men took addmonitions of their

1096
01:58:00.88 --> 01:58:09.60
elders too heart as they hardened themselves to mercy and remembered sand creek the spirit of revenge

1097
01:58:09.60 --> 01:58:17.84
rolled with the thunder from hooves of war horses across the frozen prairies crazy horse

1098
01:58:17.84 --> 01:58:23.44
joined the second attack on julesburg but the whites were reluctant to meet them face to face

1099
01:58:23.44 --> 01:58:28.96
in the open so there there was no fighting to speak of they left the post ablaze after taking

1100
01:58:28.96 --> 01:58:32.16
all they could carry from the storehouses

1101
01:58:32.16 --> 01:58:44.88
so they go and they're just out doing these raids and just getting after essentially right now

1102
01:58:44.88 --> 01:58:55.44
we're at total war and yes we are and here's the disturbing thing is those soldiers at

1103
01:58:55.44 --> 01:59:03.76
sand creek they were you know not connected to the soldiers that were in Montana not connected

1104
01:59:03.76 --> 01:59:07.60
the soldiers that he's at the fourth day and no what had happened and or maybe they knew what happened

1105
01:59:07.60 --> 01:59:13.60
but they I'm sure some of them said oh what the hell's going on with that just and so now you had

1106
01:59:13.60 --> 01:59:20.96
you have the whites that are that have been looking at all the Indians as the same I mean

1107
01:59:20.96 --> 01:59:26.08
I guess maybe not because they they are they are have some like the crows they work with the

1108
01:59:26.08 --> 01:59:30.40
crows directly but you're starting to see the two sides divide and it's you're either on this

1109
01:59:30.40 --> 01:59:36.000
side or that side and that's it and we're going to take vengeance on if you're white you're you're

1110
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:44.24
getting attacked yeah and rightly so and that's very defender of the people then that's what

1111
01:59:44.24 --> 01:59:53.68
you you have to do and just turn it to a trishon warfare yeah and it's just it's not it's just escalation

1112
01:59:53.68 --> 02:00:00.40
and it's not going to stop so they're out doing these raids who are going in these battles

1113
02:00:00.40 --> 02:00:08.96
crazy horse continues to distinguish himself here's here so here's something that occurs they

1114
02:00:08.96 --> 02:00:14.24
had not succeeded in wiping out the soldiers because a few impetuous young men couldn't hold

1115
02:00:14.24 --> 02:00:20.96
themselves back for the right moment this was on an ambush and some of the young guys went hard

1116
02:00:20.96 --> 02:00:27.60
early and so it was a problem that had had to be corrected if they were to defeat the whites

1117
02:00:27.60 --> 02:00:31.84
they all agreed and one way to solve the problem was to find strong young men to lead the others

1118
02:00:32.56 --> 02:00:37.12
for that they said perhaps they should renew the tradition of the shirt wearers

1119
02:00:37.12 --> 02:00:43.92
some people scoffed at such talk no shirt wearers had been selected for a generation because the

1120
02:00:43.92 --> 02:00:49.04
purpose behind the tradition had been forgotten a shirt wearer was to be a young man of strong

1121
02:00:49.04 --> 02:00:55.36
action and good ways one to set the example for others instead the tradition had become the father

1122
02:00:55.36 --> 02:01:01.76
choosing his son to wear the shirt next better to let it be some said instead of dishonoring a good

1123
02:01:01.76 --> 02:01:07.36
thing so they they used to have hey if you were a badass you'd get this shirt but then eventually

1124
02:01:07.36 --> 02:01:15.28
became you know oh it's my son I'm gonna get him hook him up little hawk was growing into a daring

1125
02:01:15.28 --> 02:01:20.48
fighter already winning several war honors but the most perplexing and heavy change was symbolized

1126
02:01:20.48 --> 02:01:27.28
in the shirt made from a height of a big horn sheep now rolled in a decorated case and waiting

1127
02:01:27.28 --> 02:01:32.64
his parent in his parents lodge also waiting with the duties and responsibilities that came with it

1128
02:01:32.64 --> 02:01:40.08
the old man leaders had indeed decided to revive the old the old tradition of shirt wearers

1129
02:01:40.08 --> 02:01:46.88
and as expected the shirts were given to young men of important families so they do end up saying

1130
02:01:46.88 --> 02:01:51.60
all right we're gonna make some shirt wearers the choice of young men the choice of young man

1131
02:01:51.60 --> 02:01:58.000
whose enemies are afraid of his horses sword or long knife horse aka an american horse surprise no one so

1132
02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:04.48
that's a bunch of guys that were you know from from important families but with the name of crazy

1133
02:02:04.48 --> 02:02:11.12
horse was announced it was announced a gasp went through the crowd and the shouts the whoops

1134
02:02:11.12 --> 02:02:16.72
and the trilling that followed with the labyrinth of all he felt truly honored yet was uncertain

1135
02:02:16.72 --> 02:02:23.28
that he was a good choice later two more shirt wearers were chosen and he was pleased that his

1136
02:02:23.28 --> 02:02:31.12
friend he dog was one the other was big road a good strong and honorable man to wear shirts

1137
02:02:32.16 --> 02:02:39.76
you must be men above all others said an old man chosen to speak you must help others before you

1138
02:02:39.76 --> 02:02:46.24
think of yourselves help the widows and those who have little to wear and to eat and have no one

1139
02:02:46.24 --> 02:02:53.84
to help them or speak for them do not look down on others or see those who look down on you

1140
02:02:54.48 --> 02:03:04.24
and do not let anger guide your mind or your heart be generous be wise and show fortitude

1141
02:03:04.24 --> 02:03:12.80
so that the people can follow what you do and then what you say above all have courage and be the

1142
02:03:12.80 --> 02:03:20.40
first to charge the enemy for it is better to lie a warrior naked in death than to be wrapped up well

1143
02:03:20.40 --> 02:03:31.28
with the heart of water inside so that's an expanded version of what you were talking about earlier

1144
02:03:31.28 --> 02:03:38.32
when they talked about the we that this idea of the shortwars and again what do they talk about

1145
02:03:39.36 --> 02:03:46.80
I mean they opened it up with think of others before you think of yourselves that's the that's the

1146
02:03:46.80 --> 02:03:52.88
that's the opener you know as and essentially they're choosing their officers right yeah

1147
02:03:52.88 --> 02:03:58.48
and it's pretty cool because well I guess part of it they're doing it by birth because they're like

1148
02:03:58.48 --> 02:04:04.80
oh you're from an important family kind of like we did it and then they're like you know

1149
02:04:04.80 --> 02:04:09.52
where was a college degree or landowners are gonna be officers everybody else is enlisted and then

1150
02:04:11.84 --> 02:04:20.24
and then by actual prowess merit merit for crazy horse you know and then then you serve

1151
02:04:20.24 --> 02:04:28.000
others before you serve yourself and there's a tradition the Marine Corps has that's freaking awesome

1152
02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:36.000
and that's at the officer eats last that is is similar in that leaders eat last

1153
02:04:37.36 --> 02:04:45.76
that's as it should be you know as it should be fast forward a little bit calling the young

1154
02:04:45.76 --> 02:04:49.68
men together high backbone scolded them for causing the ambush to fail this is after they

1155
02:04:49.68 --> 02:04:53.76
obviously just failed on an ambush the young men listened without protests as he reminded them

1156
02:04:53.76 --> 02:05:01.28
that fighting the whites was not a war for glory but a war for survival you reminded them of

1157
02:05:01.28 --> 02:05:05.68
sand creek when he finished there was a loud affirmation but an even louder one came after

1158
02:05:05.68 --> 02:05:10.32
he announced his plan for another ambush most of the fighting men would hide themselves and their

1159
02:05:10.32 --> 02:05:15.92
horses in the ridges and gullies on either side of the wagon trail from prairie dog Greek to

1160
02:05:15.92 --> 02:05:21.20
lodge trail ridge a small group would attack the wood gathers who always went out from the fort by

1161
02:05:21.20 --> 02:05:26.24
wagon in the morning when the soldiers came out to drive the attackers away 10 decoys would show

1162
02:05:26.24 --> 02:05:32.80
themselves and lead them toward lodge trail ridge and then north down us down to a slope ending

1163
02:05:32.80 --> 02:05:38.24
in a meadow before prairie dog creek when the signal was given the hiding warriors were attacked

1164
02:05:38.24 --> 02:05:45.44
and not before or and not before or the ambush would be spoiled the soldiers had to believe that

1165
02:05:45.44 --> 02:05:52.56
only 10 doig decoys were fighting them most important to the plan were the decoys if they failed

1166
02:05:52.56 --> 02:05:58.56
several hundred fighting men would be denied the opportunity for victory therefore the decoys needed

1167
02:05:58.56 --> 02:06:04.56
a strong leader one skilled in warfare with proven judgment in battle the leader of the decoys

1168
02:06:04.56 --> 02:06:10.88
would be crazy horse the cries and shelter affirmation rang through camp and fighting man

1169
02:06:10.88 --> 02:06:16.32
young and old crowded around to put their names in as one of the other nine

1170
02:06:20.24 --> 02:06:25.84
they do some preparation then the attack came well away from the fort but still within sight

1171
02:06:25.84 --> 02:06:30.88
so the Lakota could be sea surrounding the wax could be seen surrounding the wagon so these

1172
02:06:30.88 --> 02:06:37.52
are the decoys going in action after initial charge the attackers kept the wagon men and escort

1173
02:06:37.52 --> 02:06:42.56
riders engaged the gunfire sounded especially sharp in the frigid mountain air soon the western

1174
02:06:42.56 --> 02:06:48.48
gates swung open a column of mounted and walking soldiers appeared the Lakota attackers kept up

1175
02:06:48.48 --> 02:06:53.68
the firing making sure the rescue column was well out of the fort as the soldiers passed their

1176
02:06:53.68 --> 02:07:00.56
thicket crazy horse and his decoys charged so this is like going as perfect to plan as it could go

1177
02:07:01.52 --> 02:07:06.16
fortunately enough of the decoys fortunately enough of the decoys had a few bullets that they could

1178
02:07:06.16 --> 02:07:11.92
fire several shots to make it seem like an all-out attack crazy horse shot a few arrows when he

1179
02:07:11.92 --> 02:07:17.04
was close enough to see the hairy faces of some of the soldiers for some moments the soldiers

1180
02:07:17.04 --> 02:07:25.28
seemed confused then they finally opened fire uneven snow covered the cover over the frozen ground

1181
02:07:25.92 --> 02:07:31.92
and dangerously frigid air with the decoys decore warriors first obstacles and bullets humming

1182
02:07:31.92 --> 02:07:36.96
past them like angry bees reminded them that they had a daunting task ahead and a long way to

1183
02:07:36.96 --> 02:07:41.68
finish it the first few mounted soldiers turned off the trail to pursue them and the rest of the

1184
02:07:41.68 --> 02:07:48.80
column fell and slowly behind them fainting head on charges the decoys would swerve at the last moment

1185
02:07:48.80 --> 02:07:53.68
well within range of the soldier guns they took the soldier north the soldiers north over the

1186
02:07:53.68 --> 02:07:58.80
frozen snow fields at one point some of the decoys including crazy horse had to ride down a

1187
02:07:58.80 --> 02:08:04.80
treacherously steep frozen slope the soldiers took the gentler slope of the south face and kept

1188
02:08:04.80 --> 02:08:10.72
pursuing an open valley with thick stand of trees on either side of the creek lay ahead with no

1189
02:08:10.72 --> 02:08:16.16
serious obstacles to impede the soldier's advance once across the creek the warriors turned straight

1190
02:08:16.16 --> 02:08:22.24
north and came inside of large trail ridge the walking soldiers were slowing down the column

1191
02:08:22.24 --> 02:08:28.000
crazy horse dismounted well within rifle range pulled out a knife and calmly scraped the ice

1192
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:33.68
from the bottom of his horses hooves when bullets began to ricochet closer and closer he

1193
02:08:33.68 --> 02:08:45.20
remounted and loped away the other decoys to infuriate the soldiers used similar tactics fast forward a

1194
02:08:45.20 --> 02:08:51.12
little bit on the ridge i think i want to say i read that this was about a multi mile like a

1195
02:08:51.12 --> 02:09:00.24
five mile trail they had to make a move five miles they had to get pursued for five miles on the ridge

1196
02:09:01.44 --> 02:09:06.88
the soldiers hesitated perhaps waiting for some to catch up the decoys renewed their efforts

1197
02:09:06.88 --> 02:09:12.56
coaxing their tired horses part way up the slope moving dangerously close one pretended to be

1198
02:09:12.56 --> 02:09:16.72
shot off his horse and immediately bounced up running behind the horse before skillfully

1199
02:09:16.72 --> 02:09:22.96
remounting from the back crazy horse had picked the right men for the task at hand for crazy horse

1200
02:09:22.96 --> 02:09:28.08
and the decoys this was the decisive moment if the waiting ambushers attacked prematurely

1201
02:09:28.08 --> 02:09:34.16
soldiers could still escape the decoys looked left and right as they proceeded north along a very

1202
02:09:34.16 --> 02:09:41.12
narrow part of the ridge but could see no movement below the slope of the ridge falling away before

1203
02:09:41.12 --> 02:09:47.68
them was the winding prairie dog creek and the end of their task now the soldiers were pressing

1204
02:09:47.68 --> 02:09:53.52
harder increasing their gunfire obviously certain that the decoys comprised the entire enemy force

1205
02:09:53.52 --> 02:09:59.52
crazy horse formed his men into a skirmish line and those with bullets had sp- with bullets to

1206
02:09:59.52 --> 02:10:06.96
spare fired at the oncoming soldiers drawing into a heavy drawing in heavy return fire

1207
02:10:06.96 --> 02:10:13.20
the decoys raced their horses down the slippery slope forming two lines as they rode they

1208
02:10:13.20 --> 02:10:18.72
crossed the flats to prairie dog creek east line of riders swinging out wide and then crossing

1209
02:10:18.72 --> 02:10:26.64
each other on the opposite side of the creek this was the signal to attack from out of the very

1210
02:10:26.64 --> 02:10:33.44
earth itself came the awaiting ambushers horses and men burst from the gullies cutbacks and what

1211
02:10:33.44 --> 02:10:40.40
little winter shrubbery was there in a heartbeat several hundred fighting men rose road south

1212
02:10:40.40 --> 02:10:46.32
some from the east and some from the west those closest to lodge trail ridge quickly shut the

1213
02:10:46.32 --> 02:10:53.44
soldiers escape route back to the fort the soldiers advanced stopped then they instinctively began to

1214
02:10:53.44 --> 02:11:00.64
fight their to fight to reach the safety of the fort the walking soldiers were shrung out to the back

1215
02:11:00.64 --> 02:11:07.36
closer to lodge trail ridge they were the first to fall as gunfire blasted up the slopes below

1216
02:11:07.36 --> 02:11:12.24
them there was no end of the guns firing the soldiers fought hard as they retreated up the ridge

1217
02:11:13.36 --> 02:11:19.04
but there was nothing to be gained they were cut off with nowhere to go wave after wave of

1218
02:11:19.04 --> 02:11:24.48
the mounted warriors fought their way up the treacherous slopes those with guns used up their bullets

1219
02:11:24.48 --> 02:11:30.16
and then resorted to their bows some had only bows and arrows arrows flew up from the east slope

1220
02:11:30.16 --> 02:11:35.84
and from the west the sky was dark with them and some found their mark in the body of a Lakota

1221
02:11:35.84 --> 02:11:42.48
or Sahila toward the end the warriors waited in among the dead and dying soldiers killing

1222
02:11:42.48 --> 02:11:48.16
them with a pistol shot or a hard skillful swing of a war club or the deadly thrust of a lance

1223
02:11:50.56 --> 02:11:55.04
and then always quiet all the soldiers were dead

1224
02:11:55.04 --> 02:12:04.56
it began with the Sahilia as they remembered sand creek and what had been done to their

1225
02:12:04.56 --> 02:12:10.56
relatives when the frenzy ended the soldiers were stripped naked fingers were chopped off

1226
02:12:10.56 --> 02:12:27.28
belly slashed open eyes gouged out many warriors were wounded but fewer than 15 had been killed

1227
02:12:28.72 --> 02:12:34.88
kind of a kind of a perfect operation really I mean it sounds us like a textbook operation

1228
02:12:34.88 --> 02:12:39.84
and those soldiers got lored out I think they're ended up being 80 of them

1229
02:12:41.36 --> 02:12:44.000
and they were all killed and then mutilated

1230
02:12:47.52 --> 02:12:54.80
fast forward a little bit snow came and winter passed a loafer brought word from the peace

1231
02:12:54.80 --> 02:13:01.76
talkers they had come with more presence kettles blankets knives and now guns and they were

1232
02:13:01.76 --> 02:13:06.72
asking for red cloud to come and sign the papers that all the Lakota could share in these gifts

1233
02:13:06.72 --> 02:13:12.24
so there could be peace in the power powder river counter the peace talkers had come with a new

1234
02:13:12.24 --> 02:13:16.72
offer as well all the country from the great muddy river to the shining mountains would be

1235
02:13:16.72 --> 02:13:23.28
Lakota land so long as the rivers shall flow and the grass grows where the whites

1236
02:13:23.28 --> 02:13:28.16
where did the whites get the power to give the Lakota lands they already controlled crazy horse

1237
02:13:28.16 --> 02:13:37.44
heard many old men ask crazy horse horse road north raid the crow's he returned with new horses

1238
02:13:38.24 --> 02:13:44.16
and to news that his uncle spotted tail had his own lands to live on given him to him by the whites

1239
02:13:45.04 --> 02:13:53.28
agency it was called crazy horse pondered this news even as red cloud road south to fort letter me

1240
02:13:53.28 --> 02:14:00.88
with a new power of his own he made a mark next to his name on the white man's piece of paper

1241
02:14:00.88 --> 02:14:04.56
and that was the fort letter me treaty of 1868

1242
02:14:10.72 --> 02:14:15.84
it's you know if you can get some people compromise and you can make some people and win some

1243
02:14:15.84 --> 02:14:26.000
people over you can divide people yeah right there's there's just done yeah there's a funny discussion

1244
02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:34.24
in there where they're like how how is red cloud sign the way our land yeah oh he is well hey

1245
02:14:34.24 --> 02:14:41.76
I'm gonna sign away my brother and laws lodging yeah yeah there it doesn't make sense to them right

1246
02:14:41.76 --> 02:14:48.96
doesn't it's just again it's like hey Jason I'll give you money for your for your air you go well

1247
02:14:48.96 --> 02:14:54.40
okay what about put do you want to buy echoes there too I can sign for echoes there yeah I'll buy that too

1248
02:14:54.96 --> 02:15:00.64
or you know I look at that one's air he got your air you know Jason sold it to me you're like what what just happened

1249
02:15:00.64 --> 02:15:12.16
you know but at the end of the day those guys whatever their motivations were

1250
02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:18.40
they kind of saw the writing on the wall and they got on the winning side and so they were trying to

1251
02:15:18.40 --> 02:15:25.28
carve themselves out even though you know they're maybe they're they're betrayers or they are betraying

1252
02:15:25.28 --> 02:15:35.04
the other locato but um it's that change thing again yeah likes it yeah you sometimes got to

1253
02:15:35.04 --> 02:15:44.96
change that horse you know returning from a hunt crazy horse stopped in the camp of no water to rest

1254
02:15:46.24 --> 02:15:51.20
since the great gathering below elk mountain two years past he had spoken to black buffalo

1255
02:15:51.20 --> 02:15:57.20
woman several times whatever had been between them and long past she was the mother of three now

1256
02:15:57.20 --> 02:16:04.000
and seemed entirely proper for him to ask about her children but each time they talked they lingered

1257
02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:09.52
longer something that did not go unnoticed by someone who knew what had happened before so now

1258
02:16:09.52 --> 02:16:16.16
black black buffalo woman waited discreetly for the gift of elk teeth crazy horse had lately been

1259
02:16:16.16 --> 02:16:22.40
leaving for her with someone but as he was preparing to leave she approached openly and brought him food

1260
02:16:23.36 --> 02:16:28.64
and they stood together talking he left not lingering too long but as he rode away some notice

1261
02:16:28.64 --> 02:16:38.24
that she watched until he was out of sight warm spoke and there's there's some

1262
02:16:40.56 --> 02:16:44.88
some talk about what was going to happen with black buffalo woman there's obviously a

1263
02:16:44.88 --> 02:16:52.80
rekindling of this thing of this relationship of this this uh this love at first sight that they had

1264
02:16:52.80 --> 02:16:59.20
had warm spoke nonetheless because much wrote on the shoulders of his son much that was important

1265
02:16:59.20 --> 02:17:07.84
to the people they will not let her go he said quietly fast forward a little bit one morning

1266
02:17:07.84 --> 02:17:14.32
after victory dances whispers flew through camp black buffalo woman had left her children with

1267
02:17:14.32 --> 02:17:22.000
relatives and rode out beside the light-haired one no two people could agree over this new turn

1268
02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:26.88
some said it was a coming for a long time since her father had made the choice of a husband for

1269
02:17:26.88 --> 02:17:32.08
her when her heart belonged to the shy quiet young man who is now the most powerful warrior among them

1270
02:17:33.20 --> 02:17:38.72
others said there would be trouble though she was a good Lakota woman free to choose her husband

1271
02:17:38.72 --> 02:17:44.72
was not one to let her have that choice besides the reasons her father and uncle had influenced her

1272
02:17:44.72 --> 02:17:49.68
choice of a husband were even more important now some said cautiously and they were right

1273
02:17:51.12 --> 02:17:56.64
the couple and their friends came to a small camp in a narrow little valley and there they rested

1274
02:17:57.28 --> 02:18:03.12
little shield he dogs brother and little big man were among were along and made a feast as night

1275
02:18:03.12 --> 02:18:09.44
fell there came a commotion and a man torn into the lodge where crazy horse and black buffalo

1276
02:18:09.44 --> 02:18:17.28
woman were guests a man worn from a hard trail and driven by anger of a jealous heart

1277
02:18:18.64 --> 02:18:25.68
no water stood above them a pistol in hand as crazy horse leap to his feet

1278
02:18:26.48 --> 02:18:28.000
the pistol boomed

1279
02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:40.16
so got a little love triangle going on no water's not happy and maybe I didn't cover it but

1280
02:18:41.04 --> 02:18:47.84
the tradition was if the woman wanted a divorce she could do that he was up to her and and the

1281
02:18:47.84 --> 02:18:52.64
man was supposed to respect it but everyone kind of knew that no water was not the kind of guy

1282
02:18:52.64 --> 02:18:57.84
that was going to let this slide it appears that there's like there's a lot of politics involved

1283
02:18:57.84 --> 02:19:01.92
with this marriage and it was an arranged marriage which is kind of outside the norm too

1284
02:19:04.24 --> 02:19:08.24
yeah incredibly tragic story so

1285
02:19:10.56 --> 02:19:16.40
luckily enough back to the book he awoken in a lodge unfamiliar to him but knew the strong old face that

1286
02:19:16.40 --> 02:19:22.48
appeared as his eye cleared and he could see one I was still swollen along with the left side of his

1287
02:19:22.48 --> 02:19:27.76
face old spotted crow his uncle the brother of long face not a degrading and held him down

1288
02:19:27.76 --> 02:19:32.40
as he tried to sit up she is back with her people the old man said and answered the question

1289
02:19:32.40 --> 02:19:39.92
on his face my cousin bad heart bull made it so no one will harm her he'd been in and out of sleep

1290
02:19:39.92 --> 02:19:44.000
for three days he was told the swelling on his face had gone down a little but he would have a

1291
02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:48.40
scar where the bullet had opened his face from the corner of his nose down to the jaw line

1292
02:19:49.12 --> 02:19:53.44
there will be black powder in the scar from the pistol warm had indicated

1293
02:19:53.44 --> 02:20:01.76
to very fine horses were tied outside his uncle's lodge sent by no water as a gesture of peace

1294
02:20:02.72 --> 02:20:08.16
take them his father advised to soften the anger of those who would take revenge in your name

1295
02:20:09.44 --> 02:20:16.40
so he did and the young men who wanted no water turned over to them set aside their anger

1296
02:20:16.40 --> 02:20:24.96
and put away their bows and guns then one night the young men who had gone into snake

1297
02:20:24.96 --> 02:20:29.04
country with little hawks slipped back into camp sorry I'm fast forward a little bit

1298
02:20:29.84 --> 02:20:38.96
the raiding so before we go there he he humbles himself basically he humbles himself the guy

1299
02:20:38.96 --> 02:20:47.04
comes to kill him shoot him in the face he happens to live and instead of starting a freaking war

1300
02:20:47.76 --> 02:20:54.16
he says all right you know what I accept the horses there's just for some forgiveness and acceptance

1301
02:20:54.16 --> 02:21:04.96
and everybody can move on yep so fast forward a little bit now then one night the young man

1302
02:21:04.96 --> 02:21:09.44
who had gone into snake country with little hawks slipped back into camp the raiding against the

1303
02:21:09.44 --> 02:21:16.80
snakes did not go well on the way home little hawk was killed by whites in an unexpected attack

1304
02:21:16.80 --> 02:21:22.80
the news was like a war club to the stomach as his mother's began to weep softly crazy horse

1305
02:21:22.80 --> 02:21:28.40
went out to stand alone in the night his brother had been killed while he had been chasing after

1306
02:21:28.40 --> 02:21:38.32
his own selfish needs so I don't I don't probably failed to make that clear but little hawk

1307
02:21:38.32 --> 02:21:44.80
we've mentioned a few times was his was crazy horses little brother and so while crazy horses

1308
02:21:44.80 --> 02:21:50.88
going through this drama and injury and recovery they go out on the raid and his little brother

1309
02:21:50.88 --> 02:21:56.88
out with I think is out with him out without his older brother for the first time dies

1310
02:22:02.88 --> 02:22:07.28
the next day he saw no water unloading meat at the lodge of a relative

1311
02:22:08.72 --> 02:22:13.28
seeming to sense crazy horses anger no water jump on his horse and galloped out of camp

1312
02:22:13.84 --> 02:22:20.08
perhaps unable to contain his anguish over both the loss of the only woman he wanted and the death of

1313
02:22:20.08 --> 02:22:26.80
his brother crazy horse grabbed the nearest horse and gave chase across broken land he kept up the

1314
02:22:26.80 --> 02:22:31.12
chase until no water plunged his horse into the elk river and escaped on the other side

1315
02:22:32.56 --> 02:22:38.88
not many days after that the council of old old men met influenced by the relatives of red cloud

1316
02:22:38.88 --> 02:22:46.24
and no water crazy horse was to return the shirt they decided his actions over the woman

1317
02:22:46.24 --> 02:22:54.88
endangered the peace of the ogala and no one outside like no one like no outside enemy could

1318
02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:02.72
and this could not be overlooked though there was anger in his own lodge and from the young men

1319
02:23:02.72 --> 02:23:10.96
at this trickery crazy horse gave back the shirt soon after that the lodge of no water moved

1320
02:23:10.96 --> 02:23:19.20
far south to another camp and whispers were made behind the hand that red cloud was to be given the

1321
02:23:19.20 --> 02:23:31.68
shirt this is like you said there's just a trajectory that that gains get to gaining speed you know you

1322
02:23:31.68 --> 02:23:39.36
lose you know you then I'll use your woman now you lose your brother now you learn to lose your

1323
02:23:40.80 --> 02:23:47.04
placement with the shirt as a shirt where and the friction points are you know him and red cloud

1324
02:23:51.12 --> 02:23:56.000
and so what is he doing he's still fighting and who's he fighting on

1325
02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:02.08
I guess unfortunately he's fighting snakes he's fighting other other Indian tribes

1326
02:24:03.36 --> 02:24:07.44
going to this section here they attack but the snakes were too many the two Lakota groups were

1327
02:24:07.44 --> 02:24:12.32
too far apart to regroup and the mud was too deep their horses tired somehow they managed to hold back

1328
02:24:13.52 --> 02:24:18.96
the determined counter attack crazy horse high backbone and good weasel with their rifles

1329
02:24:18.96 --> 02:24:25.76
were rear guard as others retreated first one fell back then another managing to keep the snakes

1330
02:24:25.76 --> 02:24:30.96
at bay but several snakes on fresh horses suddenly were able to surround high backbone

1331
02:24:32.80 --> 02:24:39.44
and crazy horse saw his old friend take a bullet in the chest still the old warrior pulled

1332
02:24:39.44 --> 02:24:46.56
out as pistol and emptied it at the on rushing enemy until they overran him crazy horse ran

1333
02:24:46.56 --> 02:24:52.24
into rescue him but his horse was too tired from pulling himself out of the mud and the enemy fire

1334
02:24:52.24 --> 02:24:58.32
was too much good weasel finally intervened grabbing the rain to his horse the rain turned into snow as

1335
02:24:58.32 --> 02:25:04.32
they rode road toward home sometime in the night they found a sheltered place and built a warming fire

1336
02:25:04.32 --> 02:25:11.12
with with their horses while their horses rested crazy horse sat huddled beneath his robe

1337
02:25:11.12 --> 02:25:14.16
alone with the thoughts of his old friend and teacher

1338
02:25:14.16 --> 02:25:23.44
so I mean it's just it's just a downward spiral at this point

1339
02:25:26.32 --> 02:25:30.88
they get back to camp crazy horse smoked his pipe and pondered all that had happened since

1340
02:25:30.88 --> 02:25:38.56
he and he dog had carried their lances against the crow much had been taken away it seemed first

1341
02:25:38.56 --> 02:25:45.60
black buffalo woman then his place is a shirt wear now his younger brother and his oldest friend were gone

1342
02:25:47.04 --> 02:25:51.60
he took little comfort in knowing they had died on the path they they had chosen

1343
02:25:52.88 --> 02:25:58.72
there was only emptiness where they had been perhaps these things had come to pass because he had

1344
02:25:58.72 --> 02:26:05.52
not fully honored the calling to be a thunder dreamer though he had learned the importance of honoring

1345
02:26:05.52 --> 02:26:11.52
the old ways from his fathers and from his father and uncles and his mothers he was not one for

1346
02:26:11.52 --> 02:26:18.56
ceremonies or standing in front of the people but if he must live the life of sacrifice he would as

1347
02:26:18.56 --> 02:26:25.36
a thunder dreamer he did not belong to himself he belonged to the people it was not what he wanted

1348
02:26:25.36 --> 02:26:44.72
for his life but it was what life wanted from him as going forward a little bit this sort of

1349
02:26:44.72 --> 02:26:51.92
collaboration with the whites continues and it continues to escalate and finally at some point

1350
02:26:51.92 --> 02:26:57.28
crazy horse returned home to resurgent rumors that minors were going into the black hills in

1351
02:26:57.28 --> 02:27:04.000
violation of the rules set down in the horse creek treaty gold was the reason I yes gold the white

1352
02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:09.68
man's god the whites were willing to risk their own lives to get gold gold was the reason for

1353
02:27:09.68 --> 02:27:14.88
their interest in the black hills the heart of everything that was to the Lakota

1354
02:27:14.88 --> 02:27:26.000
so they got the sacred the sacred black hills and the whites want to get gold this is

1355
02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:33.04
this is going breaking away from the story for a second and going into one of the reflections

1356
02:27:33.04 --> 02:27:44.32
sections from from marshal in this point most boys therefore basically learn the same lessons

1357
02:27:44.32 --> 02:27:49.36
and we're given the same opportunities to perform as fighting men so how does a crazy horse emerge

1358
02:27:49.36 --> 02:27:56.16
from a broad cultural blueprint and set himself apart perhaps he is testimony to the premise

1359
02:27:56.16 --> 02:28:02.56
that some things cannot be taught perhaps there is something innate that some have and others don't

1360
02:28:02.56 --> 02:28:08.16
men and women who coach young athletes point out that while skill and methodology can be taught to

1361
02:28:08.16 --> 02:28:13.44
any athlete the physical attributes of speed and quickness are frequently the difference between a

1362
02:28:13.44 --> 02:28:19.20
good athlete and an outstanding one many people dream of becoming leaders while others

1363
02:28:19.20 --> 02:28:23.92
shun the opportunity even when it falls into their laps general George Pat and a World War II

1364
02:28:23.92 --> 02:28:30.24
fame certainly sought the responsibilities of leadership and reveled in its rewards and prestige

1365
02:28:30.24 --> 02:28:36.000
when he was successful crazy horse on the other hand was not as quick to grab the opportunity when it

1366
02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:42.08
came and literally had no desire to talk about his exploits but both were exceptional leaders

1367
02:28:42.08 --> 02:28:47.28
and their accomplishments could not have been achieved without a certain amount of basic ability

1368
02:28:47.28 --> 02:28:52.96
as well as the experience of winning and losing what is less obvious is that both of them also

1369
02:28:52.96 --> 02:28:59.52
had inherent characteristics only a few of us have those characteristics enabled them to perform

1370
02:28:59.52 --> 02:29:04.16
daring and reckless deeds and make bold decisions and to inspire others to follow them

1371
02:29:05.12 --> 02:29:11.68
what those characteristics are by name or label is often difficult to identify but the consequences

1372
02:29:11.68 --> 02:29:21.84
they enable are not difficult to see. guys had some attributes you know and that question comes

1373
02:29:21.84 --> 02:29:27.76
up a lot for our leaders born or made and I always my answer which I wrote about leadership strategy

1374
02:29:27.76 --> 02:29:33.68
tactics is you're gonna have some strengths and weaknesses all of us are are you gonna be lucky

1375
02:29:33.68 --> 02:29:41.44
enough to have you know the full of the full catalog of great leadership assets chances are

1376
02:29:41.44 --> 02:29:48.72
about zero. could you be a George Patton that you know has your articulate and your smart

1377
02:29:48.72 --> 02:29:52.96
and your calm and you you have control of your most you can read people like all those things

1378
02:29:53.76 --> 02:29:58.72
I guess but it's gonna be very rare we're gonna have strength and weaknesses and

1379
02:29:58.72 --> 02:30:07.20
and occasionally some people are gonna get that level of charisma and an influence over other people

1380
02:30:07.20 --> 02:30:16.64
um that's gonna come from a place maybe not maybe you can't teach that there's parts of

1381
02:30:16.64 --> 02:30:21.36
leadership that you can absolutely teach there's parts of even you know the way you care yourself

1382
02:30:21.36 --> 02:30:30.32
that you can improve but what we what we always teach people is you got to build a team of leaders

1383
02:30:30.32 --> 02:30:35.92
that help you with the your areas of weakness so if there's something you're not maybe not that great

1384
02:30:35.92 --> 02:30:45.60
at find someone on your team that is boy and if you want to find step on to success hey start

1385
02:30:45.60 --> 02:30:52.88
treating everybody with respect and and and like they said with their leaders their their

1386
02:30:52.88 --> 02:30:59.68
their deal is your job is to teach is to take care of the people and then people will do

1387
02:30:59.68 --> 02:31:09.20
almost anything for you um yeah I'm gonna do it. Just one of the lessons that you just you could

1388
02:31:09.20 --> 02:31:17.04
take away from this and and see that like crazy horses doing all these things but he's not really

1389
02:31:17.04 --> 02:31:22.96
bragging about it but everybody sees it and everyone else is talking about it which makes it seem even

1390
02:31:22.96 --> 02:31:28.32
greater yeah and then you know when he comes back from a raid the first thing he does he's like

1391
02:31:28.32 --> 02:31:32.64
I got all these horses let me go give them to the widows and let me divide up all this stuff and

1392
02:31:32.64 --> 02:31:40.16
give it and take care of take care of which is a job. Yeah put others before yourself step one.

1393
02:31:45.28 --> 02:31:49.84
Go back the book black buffalo woman Red Cloud's niece was the love of his life politics

1394
02:31:49.84 --> 02:31:55.44
however influenced her choice for a husband she married no water only because he was of an influential

1395
02:31:55.44 --> 02:32:00.88
family and their union enabled a broader influence in a stronger political base crazy horse was of

1396
02:32:00.88 --> 02:32:06.64
course heartbroken in time the wound would heal but as it's often the case a true love has never

1397
02:32:06.64 --> 02:32:11.68
completely forgotten a few years later when the opportunity arose black buffalo woman followed

1398
02:32:11.68 --> 02:32:17.92
her heart and left her husband the coat of women can make a choice because societal norms allowed it

1399
02:32:17.92 --> 02:32:23.12
but in her case a jealous husband did not and this did to him just kind of debriefing this crazy horse

1400
02:32:23.12 --> 02:32:27.04
to put himself in harm's way many times as a fighting man but he probably never came as close to

1401
02:32:27.04 --> 02:32:31.76
dying as he did when no water showed up with the borrowed pistol and shot him in the face

1402
02:32:31.76 --> 02:32:36.64
it was no water's intention to kill crazy horse and he thought he did the subsequent fewer

1403
02:32:36.64 --> 02:32:42.08
brought several factions on the brink of blood shed on one side someone to defend no water and

1404
02:32:42.08 --> 02:32:47.28
on the other someone to revenge crazy horse to prevent any violence crazy horse gave up the love of

1405
02:32:47.28 --> 02:32:55.44
his life for a second time those who were jealous of him were quick to influence the old men

1406
02:32:55.44 --> 02:33:01.36
leaders to strip them of the position of shirt wearer crazy horse willingly gave up the shirt

1407
02:33:01.36 --> 02:33:06.48
but the status he had achieved circumvented the loss of influence many people though not totally

1408
02:33:06.48 --> 02:33:11.28
overlooking his mistakes till regard him as a strong leader and remain loyal to him it was a

1409
02:33:11.28 --> 02:33:18.000
lesson not lost on him never again did he put his own desires above the needs of the people that

1410
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:24.72
was yet another example for others to follow true leadership is rarely the consequence of election

1411
02:33:24.72 --> 02:33:31.28
appointment dictatorship or inheritance good leadership overall is much too critical to be left to

1412
02:33:31.28 --> 02:33:38.48
elected politicians monarchs managers administrators supervisors and directors having a

1413
02:33:38.48 --> 02:33:43.36
authority does not make anyone a leader true leadership is exercised when someone performs a

1414
02:33:43.36 --> 02:33:48.16
necessary or critical task and accomplishes an objective thereby setting an example

1415
02:33:49.04 --> 02:33:53.92
most of us will never face the daunting task of leading men and women in the combat

1416
02:33:53.92 --> 02:33:58.80
but we will likely have an opportunity to set an example we may not carry titles such as

1417
02:33:58.80 --> 02:34:04.32
president governor mayor general or even chief but we can be leaders simply by demonstrating

1418
02:34:04.32 --> 02:34:12.96
that effort can be made tasks can be accomplished

1419
02:34:16.24 --> 02:34:23.68
yeah you know it's interesting you look at a seal puttor and there's gonna be between one and five

1420
02:34:23.68 --> 02:34:28.72
leaders in there hopefully there might be zero but that's chances are very small of that

1421
02:34:29.36 --> 02:34:34.24
there's gonna be one to five and they might be anyone of the puttor and you can just see

1422
02:34:34.24 --> 02:34:39.28
and if they're well balanced you know like there's some young guy or you know one cruise wonder

1423
02:34:39.28 --> 02:34:45.76
that's just has good natural leadership ability smart has he going check and he can make things

1424
02:34:45.76 --> 02:34:50.08
happen and it doesn't matter that he's not the chief it doesn't matter he's not the lieutenant

1425
02:34:50.72 --> 02:34:54.48
and as long as the chief and lieutenant humble enough guy hey he's a good leader hey you want to run

1426
02:34:54.48 --> 02:34:59.44
this thing it's gonna be fine occasionally those guys get mad they get scared they get intimidated

1427
02:34:59.44 --> 02:35:07.28
they don't want someone running things they think they should be and yeah I've seen it where

1428
02:35:08.24 --> 02:35:15.84
you get like a new guy in a puttor and any isn't necessarily calling any shots but because his

1429
02:35:15.84 --> 02:35:20.96
demeanor he's like got a good demeanor he's never bummed out it's like yeah everything's really

1430
02:35:20.96 --> 02:35:27.04
terrible and it's like yeah this whatever and you'll watch that like his his influence because

1431
02:35:27.04 --> 02:35:30.40
he's got a good attitude even in a worse situation will bleed over to the rest of the puttor

1432
02:35:30.40 --> 02:35:37.52
and so guys are kicking rocks and saying this where you this is done that that that that that

1433
02:35:37.52 --> 02:35:44.32
great attitude is is contagious so that leadership kind of by example even when they're not really

1434
02:35:44.32 --> 02:35:48.96
influenced people what to do they're influencing the overall effectiveness of the unit by

1435
02:35:48.96 --> 02:35:58.08
bringing it's morale of the race the morale that's freaking priceless priceless the hits just keep on

1436
02:35:58.08 --> 02:36:06.48
coming um crazy horse who who at now as a different wife he he he he has a daughter with she dies

1437
02:36:09.52 --> 02:36:14.80
death was not new to him men died and battle sometimes and he was not surprised by that they were gone

1438
02:36:14.80 --> 02:36:20.24
or at that or the way that they had died as fighting men but the bundle atop is scaffold was

1439
02:36:20.24 --> 02:36:27.04
harder reality it was a reality that challenged the goodness in life he fell across it and wept

1440
02:36:27.04 --> 02:36:32.80
uncontrollably days passed there was thunder some wind and a little rain when he could no longer stay

1441
02:36:32.80 --> 02:36:40.16
awake he slept beneath the scaffold curled up on her robe he ignored hunger and thirst warm

1442
02:36:40.16 --> 02:36:46.16
had told him a kind of coughing sickness unknown before the whites came had taken her though he had

1443
02:36:46.16 --> 02:36:52.32
tried he could find no medicine to help her finally when no more tears would come crazy horse took his

1444
02:36:52.32 --> 02:37:00.64
leave the news that awaited him fanned his anger even more soldiers had gone into the black hills

1445
02:37:00.64 --> 02:37:07.20
a large contingent according to the sketchy reports from the few from a few Lakota who had

1446
02:37:07.20 --> 02:37:11.44
the misfortune of being in the wrong place the wrong time a group friendly to the whites

1447
02:37:11.44 --> 02:37:17.12
had been watching the column of wagons and the soldiers when they when they were attacked one

1448
02:37:17.12 --> 02:37:23.92
Lakota was killed another wounded they somehow managed to escape to tell their story so now you're

1449
02:37:23.92 --> 02:37:30.000
you know you're blaming the death of your daughter on the whites as well and now they're going into

1450
02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:43.04
your holy land yeah so now they go out and start just basically killing whites where they can

1451
02:37:43.04 --> 02:37:48.16
find them the most vulnerable at this time is the minors people that are out in these little mining

1452
02:37:48.16 --> 02:37:54.88
camps and so they start initiating more of a more of a guerrilla warfare and this is something that

1453
02:37:54.88 --> 02:38:01.60
you know knowing what we know now about insurgency's that would have been the call because they

1454
02:38:01.60 --> 02:38:08.32
couldn't get people to unite but that fighting like an insurgent war would have been the well

1455
02:38:08.32 --> 02:38:12.80
would have been another possibility and that's what he kind of end up doing here he says the

1456
02:38:12.80 --> 02:38:17.92
tactics crazy horse and his companions were simple yet effective after observing isolated minors

1457
02:38:17.92 --> 02:38:22.64
camps to determine their numbers and weapons they position themselves and swept in if the terrain

1458
02:38:22.64 --> 02:38:27.92
was rough was rough and offered good cover they sneaked in close on foot before they attacked

1459
02:38:27.92 --> 02:38:33.92
in open areas with little cover they charged in on horses that's kind of crazy because that's exactly

1460
02:38:33.92 --> 02:38:39.20
what we would do like if we had if we could sneak into a target on foot we do that if we couldn't

1461
02:38:39.20 --> 02:38:44.08
we just tried the vehicles right up to the target and that's what the exact same thing they would do

1462
02:38:44.08 --> 02:38:49.92
massive explosive breach lots of nowhere common in in either situation they use their

1463
02:38:49.92 --> 02:38:55.20
lances and war clubs and the silent bow quite effectively rarely did any minor react quickly enough

1464
02:38:55.20 --> 02:39:00.000
to fire a gun which worked in the Lakota's favor without gunshots to warn anyone else in the

1465
02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:05.76
area the minors in the next valley or watershed remained oblivious and thus vulnerable to attack

1466
02:39:08.40 --> 02:39:13.68
he says this it was necessary to attack the minors and kill them they were trespassers and thieves

1467
02:39:13.68 --> 02:39:18.24
not honorable enemies the tactics they used were the only way to fight them especially in the

1468
02:39:18.24 --> 02:39:23.44
black hills strike hard and fast and flicked and inflict as much chaos and as many casualties

1469
02:39:23.44 --> 02:39:29.04
as possible and then withdraw swiftly that kind of fighting could play to the Lakota's strengths

1470
02:39:29.04 --> 02:39:34.72
and skills as fighters good at close combat crazy horse spoke these thoughts to his companions

1471
02:39:34.72 --> 02:39:40.88
as they rode home and they listened and agreed they'd seen firsthand what could be done if enough

1472
02:39:40.88 --> 02:39:46.64
Lakota fighting men could be persuaded to fight in the same way and if enough bullets and powder

1473
02:39:46.64 --> 02:39:55.52
could be obtained the whites could be driven away yeah I mean that's the only strategy they got

1474
02:39:55.52 --> 02:39:59.44
because they the minors have got all these things they need they got guns and they got bullets

1475
02:39:59.44 --> 02:40:06.16
they're not getting those from anybody else and so they just sneak in pick them up sneak in pick them

1476
02:40:07.20 --> 02:40:11.20
meanwhile red cloud it was learned who's making the trip to persuade the powers and

1477
02:40:11.20 --> 02:40:17.12
Washington to remove the little agent from his agency when all is said and done it didn't matter

1478
02:40:17.12 --> 02:40:21.44
who the agent was on spotted tail agency or on the red cloud agency as long as there was an

1479
02:40:21.44 --> 02:40:27.76
agent and the Lakota accepted it and newbies the whites were in control but when red cloud and the

1480
02:40:27.76 --> 02:40:34.000
others returned and there were many supposed headmen who made the trip the news they brought back

1481
02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:38.72
in sensed the wild Lakota and you made this distinction I haven't pulled it out yet but there's

1482
02:40:38.72 --> 02:40:43.84
basically the the ones that are living in the agencies and then there's the Lakota that are wild

1483
02:40:43.84 --> 02:40:48.24
that are still living in the traditional way to the best of their ability and I say the best

1484
02:40:48.24 --> 02:40:56.40
of the ability because they relied heavily on buffalo and the buffalo were being wiped out and so

1485
02:40:57.52 --> 02:41:05.28
this makes living in their traditional way much more difficult in some cases probably impossible

1486
02:41:05.28 --> 02:41:14.96
the great father wanted to buy the black hills sell the heart of everything that is sell the

1487
02:41:14.96 --> 02:41:22.72
dust of the ancestors not looking not there's there's Lakota that we're just we're not doing it

1488
02:41:26.72 --> 02:41:31.76
the day now there's more politics takes place and eventually they're supposed to all come and

1489
02:41:31.76 --> 02:41:37.60
report the day when all Lakota had to report to the agencies it coming gone the northern camps were nervous

1490
02:41:37.60 --> 02:41:42.64
watching the horizons for the first sign of soldiers that they had heard had been gathering at

1491
02:41:42.64 --> 02:41:47.52
Fort Fetterman when it relaxed its grip and a span of warm days it melted the snow and

1492
02:41:47.52 --> 02:41:52.72
followed the ice on the creeks and rivers he dog took advantage of the opportunity to head for the agency

1493
02:41:53.28 --> 02:41:57.76
his contingent of eight Lakota families were mostly women and children in no condition

1494
02:41:57.76 --> 02:42:03.52
outrun mounted soldiers before he left crazy horse had ridden up into the hills unable to watch

1495
02:42:03.52 --> 02:42:09.84
his closest friend give into the agency though he understood all too painfully he dogs reasons

1496
02:42:10.88 --> 02:42:16.32
the spaces vacated by eight lodges were not as big as the holes left in the hearts of the

1497
02:42:16.32 --> 02:42:22.48
relatives who watched their loved ones riding away slowly and uncertainly looking back frequently

1498
02:42:22.48 --> 02:42:32.88
I mean you know the guys got a bunch of women and kids and the he knows he's gonna do so much and

1499
02:42:36.08 --> 02:42:41.20
sitting bull sent out his carefully chosen messages to announce that the people should gather near

1500
02:42:41.20 --> 02:42:46.64
chalk butts in late spring and treating them to speak wisely and clearly to the leaders among

1501
02:42:46.64 --> 02:42:52.40
the Lakota as well as the Dakota and Nakota he wanted his messages to appeal to their sense of

1502
02:42:52.40 --> 02:42:57.52
pride especially to those who are surely disenchanted with life on the agencies so sitting bulls

1503
02:42:57.52 --> 02:43:05.76
another wild one of the Indians and he's very I mean obviously we've all heard of sitting bull

1504
02:43:05.76 --> 02:43:09.84
and so he has incredible amount of influence and he's starting to try and gather people up and

1505
02:43:09.84 --> 02:43:18.72
unite them a little bit so that starts to take place more and more people arrived almost every

1506
02:43:18.72 --> 02:43:23.60
day the horse herb was growing and eating down the sparse grass around the butts some of the men

1507
02:43:23.60 --> 02:43:28.64
said perhaps there was many as 7,000 head sitting bulls already at work inviting the older leaders

1508
02:43:28.64 --> 02:43:34.08
to his lodge he was an impressive and charismatic man a slight limp from a gunshot wound to his

1509
02:43:34.08 --> 02:43:39.68
hip during his days a young fighting man served only to give him more credibility he had earned nearly

1510
02:43:39.68 --> 02:43:47.68
70 battle honors more than any man at the gathering except crazy horse now past the age of 50 he had

1511
02:43:47.68 --> 02:43:53.52
a solid reputation as a wise leader and counselor enhanced by his status as a medicine man he was

1512
02:43:53.52 --> 02:43:59.20
immensely pleased at the response to his message and announced he would conduct a Sundance

1513
02:43:59.92 --> 02:44:06.000
spiritually as well as psychologically it was the right thing at the right time it could only

1514
02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:11.20
serve to unify the people and add to the feelings of strength and pride that seemed to be growing

1515
02:44:11.20 --> 02:44:15.68
as quickly as the horse herd it was that kind of insight that made him an influential leader

1516
02:44:15.68 --> 02:44:22.64
the camp movement moved west across the powder and the tongue into the valley of the rose bud

1517
02:44:23.76 --> 02:44:28.96
and across it as well turning at the northern slopes of the wolf mountains into the broken

1518
02:44:28.96 --> 02:44:37.52
country near the greasy grass river while sitting bull was hard at work for the hearts and minds

1519
02:44:37.52 --> 02:44:44.56
the people crazy horse scouts and all directions feeling among the military leaders was that the

1520
02:44:44.56 --> 02:44:58.24
biggest threat laid to lay to the south from three stars army and this book does not have a

1521
02:44:58.24 --> 02:45:03.68
ton of detail about the battle at rose bud or really the battle at little big horn

1522
02:45:05.52 --> 02:45:10.32
those are detailed pretty well in the book I fought with custard and also in the book wooden leg

1523
02:45:10.32 --> 02:45:17.12
um but there is sort of a debriefing here on some of the things that went that went down

1524
02:45:17.84 --> 02:45:22.64
going to the book the rose bug bud fight as the battle came to be known was the toughest combat

1525
02:45:22.64 --> 02:45:28.08
crazy horse had seen the battle of hundred and hand ten years earlier that was when they

1526
02:45:28.64 --> 02:45:35.52
surrounded those soldiers and killed the bird the battle of the hundred in the hand ten years earlier

1527
02:45:35.52 --> 02:45:39.68
had had its own set of circumstances that made it tough but at the rose bud

1528
02:45:39.68 --> 02:45:46.32
Lakota the Lakota faced a larger and more heavily armed enemy force three stars soldiers were both

1529
02:45:46.32 --> 02:45:53.20
infantry and cavalry forcing Lakota to adjust to different tactics as the fighting progressed attack

1530
02:45:53.60 --> 02:45:59.52
was met with counter attack as the day war on the valley of the rose bud funded with gunfire and dust

1531
02:45:59.52 --> 02:46:03.92
hung in the air laid in the afternoon who is evident that the soldiers were disorganized fighting

1532
02:46:03.92 --> 02:46:10.32
and scattered units their effectiveness significantly reduced crazy horse was notified even though

1533
02:46:10.32 --> 02:46:17.60
nearly a hundred had arrived at mid-morning the Lakota and sahila were critically low on ammunition

1534
02:46:18.32 --> 02:46:23.76
sensing that three stars wouldn't be able to mount any pursuit crazy horse sent the word to withdraw

1535
02:46:24.40 --> 02:46:31.20
crazy horse rode with he dog big road and good weasel among others as they once again

1536
02:46:31.20 --> 02:46:37.52
chased dusk into night there was no pursuit from the soldiers to speak of the feverish after

1537
02:46:37.52 --> 02:46:42.56
math of combat slowly faded as the reality of the day began to take hold ten good men in

1538
02:46:42.56 --> 02:46:48.64
been killed and many wounded in a day or two the the scouts crazy horse had left behind would report

1539
02:46:48.64 --> 02:46:56.24
on the soldiers so that's the first big battle that they engage is that battle at rose bud

1540
02:46:56.24 --> 02:47:01.84
and then six days had passed since the rose bud fight victory dance is still went

1541
02:47:01.84 --> 02:47:06.24
far into the night and the fighting men were asked to tell the stories of their involvement

1542
02:47:06.24 --> 02:47:11.12
the mood of the encampment had changed from initial uncertainty to one of comfortable

1543
02:47:11.12 --> 02:47:17.52
sense of strength hardly anyone no matter how old could remember the Lakota ever see gathering

1544
02:47:17.52 --> 02:47:24.48
in such numbers for any purpose at midday sitting bull sent cryers to announce the move

1545
02:47:24.48 --> 02:47:31.52
to the greasy grass valley and by mid afternoon the first lodges were taken down and the

1546
02:47:31.52 --> 02:47:37.12
families began moving by sundown most of the encampment was gone except for a few lodges

1547
02:47:37.12 --> 02:47:48.64
and the sun dance arbor fast forward up a little bit more there in their kind of camp now

1548
02:47:49.44 --> 02:47:53.28
and we'll go to the book the sides of the council lodging and rolled up to allow cross

1549
02:47:53.28 --> 02:47:58.40
ventilation a few men were waiting in anticipation meeting with sitting bull women had already

1550
02:47:58.40 --> 02:48:03.52
brought food sitting bull had been busy through most of the night attending to a gravely ill woman

1551
02:48:03.52 --> 02:48:09.12
he arrived at the council lodged just as a slight den of commotion came from the south end of the

1552
02:48:09.12 --> 02:48:15.52
encampment where he had just been a lone Lakota rider splashed across the greasy grass

1553
02:48:16.24 --> 02:48:22.40
filled bank to bank with the heavy spring runoff from the mountain snows gaining the west bank

1554
02:48:22.40 --> 02:48:27.84
he began to shout prepare yourselves the soldiers are coming the soldiers are coming

1555
02:48:31.84 --> 02:48:34.88
and this is when we get into the little big horn battle

1556
02:48:37.44 --> 02:48:42.64
the soldiers across the river far to the south near the mouth vash creek can try to gallop

1557
02:48:43.28 --> 02:48:48.48
tried galloping their horses across the long open flood plain toward the south end of the encampment

1558
02:48:48.48 --> 02:48:53.04
they had been quickly driven back and then chased across the river many were killed at the water

1559
02:48:53.04 --> 02:48:59.28
crossing after heavy fighting in some trees near the river as far as crazy horse and the other

1560
02:48:59.28 --> 02:49:07.28
leaders were concerned that was the first fight gall of the hunk papa and ol and ogala battle

1561
02:49:07.28 --> 02:49:12.96
leaders black moon and big road were among those who had courageously led 200 fighting men in that action

1562
02:49:12.96 --> 02:49:21.60
the second fight started at medicine tail kooley more soldiers had tried to cross into the

1563
02:49:21.60 --> 02:49:26.88
encampment from the north end but were stopped by a small determined group of boys and old men

1564
02:49:26.88 --> 02:49:32.80
armed mostly with old single shot rifles by then many of the women children old people were

1565
02:49:32.80 --> 02:49:39.04
fleeing to the northwest somehow worded reached crazy horse and gall of the second attempted

1566
02:49:39.04 --> 02:49:44.08
incursion gall immediately disengaged from the first fight and let a hundred men to medicine tail

1567
02:49:44.08 --> 02:49:51.60
and crossed the soldiers galloped away up a long slope to the north crazy horse at hurried to

1568
02:49:51.60 --> 02:49:56.32
to his lodge and found black shawl that's his wife waiting with his second war horse

1569
02:49:56.32 --> 02:50:00.64
the camp was in total confusion not only were women and children running away to safety

1570
02:50:00.64 --> 02:50:05.84
men were galloping through to hurried to the second fight shouts and screams filled the air

1571
02:50:05.84 --> 02:50:12.80
gunshots could be heard to the south and now thinly to the north he took a second war horse

1572
02:50:12.80 --> 02:50:18.48
and gall there is many men as to him as he could if a second group of soldiers was heading

1573
02:50:18.48 --> 02:50:22.96
north they could be circling to attack from another direction it made sense to try and flank

1574
02:50:22.96 --> 02:50:27.76
them so he led the men who were with him to an old crossing guessing the soldiers would stay on

1575
02:50:27.76 --> 02:50:31.92
the high ground he had crossed the river and raised to meet them if they came off the end of the

1576
02:50:31.92 --> 02:50:37.60
high north south ridge where he knew they laid to the east on the slopes across the river they

1577
02:50:37.60 --> 02:50:44.16
circled to the east and encountered 20 or so soldiers whom they chased back to the main body

1578
02:50:44.16 --> 02:50:50.64
the gunfire never stopped he heard it as they crossed the river a continuous sound rather like

1579
02:50:50.64 --> 02:50:57.12
someone tearing canvas gall and his men crazy horse heard later stayed in pursuit of the running

1580
02:50:57.12 --> 02:51:03.44
soldiers even though they did not gain a ridge at first the soldiers were organized even managing

1581
02:51:03.44 --> 02:51:08.96
to dismount and form skirmish lines to fire at the oncoming Lakota but galls relentless pursuit

1582
02:51:08.96 --> 02:51:14.16
broke their lines and after that they were running away and their fire was no longer effective

1583
02:51:15.44 --> 02:51:21.60
crazy horse led a charge when the soldiers tried to push north off their ridge by then gunfire

1584
02:51:21.60 --> 02:51:27.60
was thinning it was sporadic and then there were silence the second fight was over as he rode

1585
02:51:27.60 --> 02:51:34.88
through the dust and he could see how it had unfolded dead horses and dead soldiers were

1586
02:51:34.88 --> 02:51:43.28
strewn along the path they had taken what's what's different about a little big horn battle

1587
02:51:43.28 --> 02:51:49.28
field then then get his bird is because the scale of it's much smaller they actually they have

1588
02:51:49.28 --> 02:51:52.96
markers for where these soldiers were dying and they went back and they could find all the

1589
02:51:52.96 --> 02:51:58.64
scourge lines and everything so you can see it in real you know laid out where bodies fell

1590
02:52:01.12 --> 02:52:05.44
became up from the river then across and then just the disaster that happened I mean you

1591
02:52:05.44 --> 02:52:08.88
couldn't all the the way it's laid out and the bodies are laid out you can see that the guys are

1592
02:52:08.88 --> 02:52:14.88
just try the last couple guys were just trying to get away and getting mold mean while the guys

1593
02:52:14.88 --> 02:52:20.88
down at the other position they're surrounded up on that hill they're waiting for their turn

1594
02:52:20.88 --> 02:52:26.32
they're wondering where cus custer splits forces all these times and there and they're wondering

1595
02:52:26.32 --> 02:52:31.68
where did he go did he leave us and some guys kind of push out and they can see

1596
02:52:32.40 --> 02:52:38.48
this big swirling thing and they can see the Lakota shooting down the ground they're like oh no

1597
02:52:38.48 --> 02:52:49.12
he's done and then they wind up getting their under siege yeah looking forward to walking that

1598
02:52:49.12 --> 02:52:59.68
battlefield myself going back to the story here after that the you know sitting bulls trying to keep

1599
02:52:59.68 --> 02:53:09.36
people there but they they kind of start to like it's the fighting's over and kind of people

1600
02:53:09.36 --> 02:53:12.96
got stuff to do right well there's another element coming toward him too and they're like hey we

1601
02:53:12.96 --> 02:53:20.16
got to move everybody yeah yeah and I'm even going past that so that happens um and eventually

1602
02:53:20.16 --> 02:53:25.12
he says this what was left of the largest gathering ever of Lakota separated in several encampments

1603
02:53:25.12 --> 02:53:29.28
moving along the eastern foothills of the shining mountain soon after the departure from Greece

1604
02:53:29.28 --> 02:53:34.40
he grasped small groups began breaking away to head for the agencies sitting bull like crazy horse

1605
02:53:34.40 --> 02:53:40.000
was deeply disappointed because they were losing the strength of numbers despite the best efforts

1606
02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:44.48
of sitting bull the people scattered some made excuses saying it was time to hunt and make meat for

1607
02:53:44.48 --> 02:53:49.36
the coming winter which was more difficult now because of the scarcity of buffalo others on a

1608
02:53:49.36 --> 02:53:55.12
bashly headed for the agencies sitting bull finally headed north to more familiar territory crazy

1609
02:53:55.12 --> 02:53:59.84
horse took his people east to the black hills finding a sheltered valley northwest of the mountains

1610
02:53:59.84 --> 02:54:13.28
to hide the camps from there he led raids into the black hills there that continues for a while

1611
02:54:14.40 --> 02:54:21.68
and this is all he does a great job in the book of just this kind of torment and anguish that

1612
02:54:21.68 --> 02:54:29.84
that crazy horse is going through as as he sees what's happening at some point dull knife

1613
02:54:29.84 --> 02:54:35.28
another one of his friends informed crazy horse that he was forced to consider living giving in

1614
02:54:35.28 --> 02:54:40.16
to life on the agency if it meant his people would be safe from facing continual conflict with the

1615
02:54:40.16 --> 02:54:47.92
long knives the idea was debated long and frequently strangely an opportunity presented itself

1616
02:54:47.92 --> 02:54:53.52
when messengers arrived bringing word to from three stars who had been given assurance that the

1617
02:54:53.52 --> 02:54:59.28
wild Lakota would be allowed to select the location for their own agencies if they signed a piece

1618
02:54:59.28 --> 02:55:06.24
agreement the only drawback was that included an agreement to sell to the sale of the black hills

1619
02:55:07.28 --> 02:55:12.32
and spite of deep seated suspicions crazy horse agreed that this important issue should be

1620
02:55:12.32 --> 02:55:20.88
discussed face to face with the long knives crazy horse and a law large detachment of warriors

1621
02:55:20.88 --> 02:55:28.16
escorted the delegation north to the fort on the elk river a group of crow scouts met the

1622
02:55:28.16 --> 02:55:34.16
emissaries just outside the walls of the fort making friendly gestures to indicate their peacefulness

1623
02:55:34.16 --> 02:55:40.16
as the eight Lakota road past them toward the gate weapons were drawn suddenly and the crow open

1624
02:55:40.16 --> 02:55:45.76
fire at point blank range on the unarmed Lakota and then fled on horseback crazy horse charged

1625
02:55:45.76 --> 02:55:50.64
down from the bluff but stopped when mounted soldiers emerge emerge from the fort instinctively

1626
02:55:50.64 --> 02:55:55.60
the Lakota emissaries turn their horses and gallop for the safety of the bluffs and protection

1627
02:55:55.60 --> 02:56:01.92
of the escort warriors only three rejoined the warriors five laid dead on the ground near the gates in

1628
02:56:01.92 --> 02:56:14.56
the fort so the chance for peace in the crow just gets gets like completely fumble fumble and um

1629
02:56:16.88 --> 02:56:23.92
yeah you know the crow had motivations to do with the dead and you know the

1630
02:56:25.52 --> 02:56:29.52
I think the guy's come out of the thing they're trying to hunt him down because they realize

1631
02:56:29.52 --> 02:56:41.20
oh dang it yep this is um the fast forward a little bit more the harsh winner should have been

1632
02:56:41.20 --> 02:56:46.72
to turn at least providing a brief respite from worrying about the long knives but that was not

1633
02:56:46.72 --> 02:56:53.52
to be to agency Lakota carrying a bold message from bear coat found the crazy horse camp

1634
02:56:53.52 --> 02:56:58.24
if the wild Lakota moved into the agencies they would be given food but would have to give up

1635
02:56:58.24 --> 02:57:08.48
their weapons and horses sword graciously has ever assured crazy horses people that it was his

1636
02:57:08.48 --> 02:57:13.28
idea to intervene because he didn't want his friends and relatives dying when peace in a good

1637
02:57:13.28 --> 02:57:21.12
life could be had so easily if crazy horse would come in meaning surrender his people would be given

1638
02:57:21.12 --> 02:57:26.000
food clothing and blankets and then he would be allowed to return to powder river area to claim

1639
02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:32.88
it as his agency so like oh you want we'll give you peace we'll give you food you can have your own

1640
02:57:32.88 --> 02:57:41.36
area only he and sitting bowl were stubborn or perhaps foolish how could anyone continue

1641
02:57:41.36 --> 02:57:46.40
resisting when even a brief battle used up the bullets that took several days of scrounging

1642
02:57:47.44 --> 02:57:52.16
half the people who followed him wanted to go into the agency they were tired of running from the

1643
02:57:52.16 --> 02:57:58.32
soldiers tired of being hungry tired of seeing relatives die they stayed because they believed he

1644
02:57:58.32 --> 02:58:04.000
had an answer of some kind something that would solve the problem of the soldiers

1645
02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:25.12
yeah you can it's just closing in and there's really not much of an option yeah these essentially

1646
02:58:25.12 --> 02:58:35.60
your glaciers glacier yeah forces just just towards him and he's gonna get crushed and squeeze in one direction

1647
02:58:35.60 --> 02:58:48.40
so they end up going to camp Robinson fast forward a little bit here nearly four months at

1648
02:58:48.40 --> 02:58:55.28
past since crazy horse people had arrived at camp Robinson 900 and all with over 1500 horses the soldiers

1649
02:58:55.28 --> 02:59:01.36
had taken their horses first and then their guns and then their hope and four months the promise

1650
02:59:01.36 --> 02:59:06.88
of an agency of their own in the north that turned into an impossible dream he blamed himself

1651
02:59:06.88 --> 02:59:14.24
partly because he could do nothing perhaps if he had learned to be an agency Lakota and put on

1652
02:59:14.24 --> 02:59:20.16
the defeated smile and the presence of three stars and other soldier leaders none of this would

1653
02:59:20.16 --> 02:59:26.64
be happening but the soldiers were not the only ones to cause the turmoil of the past four months

1654
02:59:26.64 --> 02:59:32.48
the finger of blame could be pointed at many Lakota as well in fact they were mostly to blame

1655
02:59:33.60 --> 02:59:39.76
the white agents and the army officers found the flames of jealousy and let little minds that could

1656
02:59:39.76 --> 02:59:47.92
not think beyond the moment and little men who yearned for recognition and power do the rest there was

1657
02:59:47.92 --> 02:59:56.32
no other way to look at it in the end the Lakota defeated themselves they had the whites outnumbered

1658
02:59:56.32 --> 03:00:02.16
an outman and did nothing the entire garrison could have been overrun by the by enough determined

1659
03:00:02.16 --> 03:00:07.84
Lakota fighting men with a good plan if they truly wanted to return to living the old way

1660
03:00:07.84 --> 03:00:16.40
and control of their lands and their lives instead men stepped over each other to betray their own

1661
03:00:16.40 --> 03:00:22.96
relatives in order to obtain the power handed out by the whites a power they couldn't get on their own

1662
03:00:26.40 --> 03:00:32.000
and he details some of this just ego drama that's going on and they have the opportunity you know

1663
03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:38.08
if I'm if I'm in camp and you know Jason crazy horse Jason's out there still being a wild

1664
03:00:38.08 --> 03:00:43.20
Lakota and I want more power in the camp maybe I say you know you don't want to you don't want to

1665
03:00:43.20 --> 03:00:48.80
deal with that Jason crazy or he's too crazy out there you don't want to put him in a power position

1666
03:00:48.80 --> 03:00:52.56
you don't want to get like all these things this happens a buffalo hunt had been promised

1667
03:00:53.36 --> 03:00:58.56
but there'd been no hunt and crazy horse understood why first someone with more power than three

1668
03:00:58.56 --> 03:01:03.76
stars had to say that the Lakota could go chasing buffalo if given the opportunity three stars

1669
03:01:03.76 --> 03:01:09.60
reason the hunters would keep going perhaps all the way to grand mother's land to join sitting

1670
03:01:09.60 --> 03:01:16.80
both which is Canada by the way adding to that some among the Lakota complain to three stars that

1671
03:01:16.80 --> 03:01:21.60
if crazy horse and his young man were allowed to hump buffalo then everyone must be allowed

1672
03:01:22.32 --> 03:01:28.40
and it was a Lakota who warned that it was dangerous to put guns in the hands of crazy horse

1673
03:01:28.40 --> 03:01:37.52
so he's just getting stabbed in the back by you know as is dream pointed out by some of his own people

1674
03:01:40.80 --> 03:01:45.84
after many of the soldier leaders at camp Robinson came to crazy horse with horse with questions

1675
03:01:45.84 --> 03:01:52.000
about the greasy grass fight and the defeat of the long hair which is cluster two agency chief

1676
03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:58.08
sent messages complaining to three star perhaps there was no place for another agency chief

1677
03:01:58.08 --> 03:02:04.000
crazy horse thought to reassure his uncle red cloud that he had no wish to be made a chief of any kind

1678
03:02:04.80 --> 03:02:09.76
but he knew anything he had to say to them would not be regarded as truth but eventually the

1679
03:02:09.76 --> 03:02:15.52
rumors did fly it was said three star would make crazy horse chief over everyone including

1680
03:02:15.52 --> 03:02:20.08
spotted tail and red clouds you can see this is just like political drama to make mark matters

1681
03:02:20.08 --> 03:02:24.32
worse many of the lesser soldier leaders with himself saying that crazy horse could influence the

1682
03:02:24.32 --> 03:02:29.60
younger men better than the two older leaders could through it all he had tried to talk to three

1683
03:02:29.60 --> 03:02:35.28
stars about the promise of a northern agency day after day traveling to Robinson from cottonwood

1684
03:02:35.28 --> 03:02:42.56
creek if you want your agency some of crazy horse's friend said carefully in low voices

1685
03:02:42.56 --> 03:02:47.44
for it was hard to know who might be listening you will have to travel to their place at

1686
03:02:47.44 --> 03:02:52.16
power where the great father lives and speak to him face to face of course they warned

1687
03:02:52.16 --> 03:02:58.24
if three star sends you ahead of red cloud or spotted tail they will find a way to make it

1688
03:02:58.24 --> 03:03:03.04
difficult for us while you're gone they will find a way to take you down when you return

1689
03:03:05.84 --> 03:03:10.88
crazy horse had no wish to travel to the great father and curry favor from a man he didn't know

1690
03:03:11.44 --> 03:03:17.28
you'd be out of place and only something for show someone to perform for the powerful crazy

1691
03:03:17.28 --> 03:03:29.04
horse did not wish to be a thing of curiosity fast forward a little bit more and now he's

1692
03:03:29.04 --> 03:03:35.84
trying to make a deal man he's trying to like get it done he knows what what where these things are

1693
03:03:35.84 --> 03:03:46.32
going he's late in the game but he's trying to make it happen yeah I mean he's got it he's got to

1694
03:03:46.32 --> 03:03:51.36
think about the women in the children at this point and he's like well you know I could keep fighting

1695
03:03:51.36 --> 03:03:57.04
but then who's going to protect them and that's where this is where the guys is so honorable

1696
03:03:57.04 --> 03:04:02.96
because he just he knows where his responsibility is it's not like how many soldiers I can kill

1697
03:04:02.96 --> 03:04:09.60
because he can kill quite a few more and he can probably you know inspire a bunch of the young

1698
03:04:09.60 --> 03:04:16.40
men on the thing to to to rise up but to what end and at the end of the the day it's the women and

1699
03:04:16.40 --> 03:04:21.44
children they're going to suffer so then he's like I gotta try and fix this and negotiate the best

1700
03:04:21.44 --> 03:04:27.44
deal that he can at that point so he starts to put to deal together

1701
03:04:29.20 --> 03:04:35.84
lieutenant Lee the soldier leader in charge at spotted tails agency sent word that crazy horse must

1702
03:04:35.84 --> 03:04:41.84
come to the soldier house crazy horse rode out with touch the clouds and white thunder spotted

1703
03:04:41.84 --> 03:04:47.44
tail and over a hundred of his young men met them on the trail Lee arrived with black crow and

1704
03:04:47.44 --> 03:04:55.36
Louis Bordeaux and was frightened seeing that he was between the minicondue and the aglala

1705
03:04:55.36 --> 03:05:01.44
on one side and spotted tails on the other there were shouts and threats hurled back and forth

1706
03:05:01.44 --> 03:05:05.52
and weapons brandished until crazy horse raised a hand in silence slowly fell over the

1707
03:05:05.52 --> 03:05:11.60
gathering Lee now very frightened told crazy horse that he must return to Robinson and make it

1708
03:05:11.60 --> 03:05:19.28
good with the soldier leaders there so the night past the morning came when the sun arose he

1709
03:05:19.28 --> 03:05:25.20
hurried to the soldier house to speak to lieutenant Lee to assure him that he had not changed his mind

1710
03:05:25.20 --> 03:05:30.32
there's ready to speak with Randall he was one of the leaders to make things good so with touch the

1711
03:05:30.32 --> 03:05:37.36
clouds swift bear and black crow along they started out for camp Robinson the first group of blue

1712
03:05:37.36 --> 03:05:45.76
coded Lakota men met them along the trail they said nothing informed a wide half circle around crazy

1713
03:05:45.76 --> 03:05:52.32
horse and the others further on more blue coded Lakota arrived and now they became a mob of more than

1714
03:05:52.32 --> 03:06:00.000
60 it was then that crazy horse knew he was in trouble so now you have Lakota's that are wearing the the

1715
03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:10.24
military the American military jacket fast thunder was lost in the crowd so tour he

1716
03:06:10.24 --> 03:06:17.44
dog and touch the clouds all around was noise of running and scuffling as if men were pushing

1717
03:06:17.44 --> 03:06:22.24
together crazy horse was pushed toward a square house made of logs a strange place for Randall the

1718
03:06:22.24 --> 03:06:27.92
Bee before he could help himself he was through the open doorway there was a bad smell a man with

1719
03:06:27.92 --> 03:06:36.08
dark hair and braids rose from the corner then he saw the iron bars he spun on a heel and saw

1720
03:06:36.08 --> 03:06:42.96
man little big man blocking the opening crazy horse shoved the shorter man aside and tried to push

1721
03:06:42.96 --> 03:06:49.36
past but almost immediately felt little big man grab both of his arms from behind with a great effort

1722
03:06:49.36 --> 03:06:56.80
he pulled himself free and reached into the opening of his blanket for the knife outside there were

1723
03:06:56.80 --> 03:07:05.20
shouts of both soldiers and the Lakota let me go he said a little big man let me go the man

1724
03:07:06.40 --> 03:07:12.08
the oglala warrior who had written in a battle with him stood fast perhaps it was the blue coat of

1725
03:07:12.08 --> 03:07:18.48
the soldier that had turned his heart with a sudden swipe crazy horse slashed the arm of the coat

1726
03:07:18.48 --> 03:07:26.08
and immediately blood flowed and little big man jump back with a step crazy horse was outside and

1727
03:07:26.08 --> 03:07:30.72
there was movement everywhere more hands grabbed at him from either side brown hands holding

1728
03:07:30.72 --> 03:07:36.72
him fast the strident voice of a soldier yelled from the middle of the confusion came a soldier

1729
03:07:36.72 --> 03:07:45.20
frusting with the knife at the end of his rifle those near him heard crazy horse gasp and saw

1730
03:07:45.20 --> 03:07:52.40
his knees begin to wobble brown hands still holding his arms even as the soldier with

1731
03:07:52.40 --> 03:08:06.40
drew the long knife let me go they heard him say quietly you've gotten me hurt then he fell

1732
03:08:06.40 --> 03:08:25.92
and crazy horse died a few hours later it details that in the book and

1733
03:08:25.92 --> 03:08:41.36
feel and his dream the dream that he had became fulfilled and again it it makes me think about

1734
03:08:41.36 --> 03:08:48.24
that that quote that native American quote from that podcast with with Mike afanke that the

1735
03:08:48.24 --> 03:08:56.96
diagnosis is a curse and this seems to be something similar when you know that thing when we're driving

1736
03:08:57.52 --> 03:09:01.92
go through that driving course and they warn you when you're going through like a tactical driving

1737
03:09:01.92 --> 03:09:05.68
course and you're driving around the track or you're driving in an out of traffic you're doing

1738
03:09:05.68 --> 03:09:09.92
these things and they warn you they give you a warning they say when you're driving if you look at

1739
03:09:09.92 --> 03:09:15.20
something you need what you need to look at is the opening you need to look at the part of the

1740
03:09:15.20 --> 03:09:19.76
track that you can drive you need to look at the part of this this road that you can go through that you

1741
03:09:19.76 --> 03:09:24.88
can make it through because if you look at another car or you look at a guardrail or you look at a

1742
03:09:24.88 --> 03:09:31.12
ditch that's where you're going that's where you're going to end up we go where we aim

1743
03:09:35.12 --> 03:09:45.04
and I don't know this is a self fulfilling prophecy here but it might be and I think it's

1744
03:09:45.04 --> 03:09:56.32
a good idea to try and set your sights on a positive outcome another thought I had about this is

1745
03:09:57.68 --> 03:10:04.88
you know BH Ladell Hart who go listen to some podcasts that I've done on BH Ladell Hart

1746
03:10:04.88 --> 03:10:09.60
the indirect approach but he also talked about the fact that

1747
03:10:09.60 --> 03:10:16.80
what happens to profits you know profits and you have leaders what happens to profits profits

1748
03:10:16.80 --> 03:10:25.36
die when you go out you profit you you make statements and you don't compromise you die

1749
03:10:27.20 --> 03:10:35.36
and your your message will get traction later on and and it's using the leaders that take the

1750
03:10:35.36 --> 03:10:43.60
message from the profit and turn it into something that can be brought to fruition you know they

1751
03:10:43.60 --> 03:10:49.04
they use compromise they use understanding and the usual relationships to to move an idea forward

1752
03:10:49.04 --> 03:10:58.16
in a more practical way but the profits the believers that don't compromise oftentimes

1753
03:10:58.16 --> 03:11:09.04
they're crucified they're killed and pretty clear where crazy horse fell in that

1754
03:11:10.56 --> 03:11:21.44
category which category he fell into powerful lessons to be learned if you want to join us

1755
03:11:21.44 --> 03:11:25.28

1764
03:12:17.44 --> 03:12:32.16
go with us go and learn this this as Americans all this is part of our shared history all these lessons

1765
03:12:32.16 --> 03:12:38.16
had both these battlefields there's so much for us to learn from and we can learn from you know

1766
03:12:38.16 --> 03:12:41.36
in the case of a lot of the things that we heard this soldiers were doing were not

1767
03:12:42.40 --> 03:12:46.56
good to look like hey this is what I'm not going to do this is not an honorable way to behave

1768
03:12:46.56 --> 03:12:56.16
and then we can see within the Lakota are talking about generosity being the a virtue of a warrior

1769
03:12:56.16 --> 03:13:01.60
and then considering that and saying that is a virtue that I want to a strive to as an American

1770
03:13:05.04 --> 03:13:09.76
yeah and that this is such a great way to learn these lessons

1771
03:13:09.76 --> 03:13:19.84
it is thanks for listening if you want to support yourself or you're supporting us you go to

1777
03:14:00.56 --> 03:14:06.88
it's a lot of the way to do it like a lot of these these like native American stories or

1778
03:14:06.88 --> 03:14:13.04
whatever reason I don't know we were talking earlier where I kind of get a little bit more into

1779
03:14:13.04 --> 03:14:18.000
I don't know why maybe because a lot of times it starts with in just right at the beginning

1780
03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:22.16
how they start with how they're raised like how the kids are raised and then you know I have

1781
03:14:22.16 --> 03:14:27.68
young kids on my man I want my kids to be like crazy worse or what was this name before crazy worse

1782
03:14:27.68 --> 03:14:35.04

1783
03:14:35.04 --> 03:14:39.28

the academy you know at the academy when we do our live sessions right every single one of them now

1794
03:15:42.72 --> 03:15:46.24
someone gives a sit right yeah we're like hey I've been I've been practicing this stuff I'm

1795
03:15:46.24 --> 03:15:50.96
checking my ego I've been working with the other teams on our group and and here's all these massive

1796
03:15:50.96 --> 03:15:58.000
successes and they just compile every week so you can hear from other leaders that are putting

1797
03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:04.24
effort into leadership instead of just not really paying attention to it and then you can quantify

1798
03:16:04.24 --> 03:16:09.52
their successes yeah so cool also to you mentioned like leaders say other leaders whatever

1799
03:16:09.52 --> 03:16:14.16
think a lot of times we talk about this from time to time we're some people some a lot of people I think

1800
03:16:14.16 --> 03:16:18.40
don't hear the word leader and then it's like that's me which kind of they were taught where

1801
03:16:18.40 --> 03:16:23.20
you they're straight up talking about that where it's like hey you don't got to be the general you

1802
03:16:23.20 --> 03:16:28.48
don't got to be the manager you don't even know everyone's kind of like a leader for different

1803
03:16:28.48 --> 03:16:35.84
reasons than the title you know great man and so when you kind of in you know hang around this group

1804
03:16:35.84 --> 03:16:40.32
a lot you know I'm not leading though I'm not I'm not I'm not manager you know nothing like that but

1805
03:16:40.32 --> 03:16:51.04
some of them team yeah but I'm over here uh uh reaping massive you know rewards from you guys

1806
03:16:51.04 --> 03:16:56.000
and it's just me you know from the beginning so I think that's like a the good thing to bring

1807
03:16:56.000 --> 03:17:01.36
up and a good distinction where it's like yeah sure you're talking to quote unquote leaders

1808
03:17:01.36 --> 03:17:06.32
but it's not just the boss you know it's like everybody's on there no there's and there's individuals

1809
03:17:06.32 --> 03:17:10.40
whether there maybe they're running their own business or they're just working somewhere yeah and

1810
03:17:10.40 --> 03:17:16.08
they're they're leading themselves and they're part of the mission yeah and you get we get great

1811
03:17:16.08 --> 03:17:22.80
feedback from them too you know and here's another thing this translates everywhere so

1812
03:17:23.60 --> 03:17:29.92
in the last couple I've been in people have talked about parenting issues

1813
03:17:29.92 --> 03:17:36.72
oh for sure the leadership straight up the life time leadership and they're like hey I had

1814
03:17:36.72 --> 03:17:41.20
you know I had this issue and I've been having this issue with my son and then I realized

1815
03:17:42.08 --> 03:17:46.72
wait a minute it's not my son it's something that I'm doing wrong and I've adjusted the way that I

1816
03:17:46.72 --> 03:17:51.04
interact with them and now things are great you know and they're looking at themselves first and

1817
03:17:51.04 --> 03:17:55.04
taking ownership and if that what you just said hits you if you're listening this right now you just

1818
03:17:55.04 --> 03:18:01.28
heard Jason say that like oh it's something wrong with me as a parent and you all that's bullshit

1819
03:18:01.84 --> 03:18:05.76
I'm that's my kid you better do what I tell if that's what you're out of two days I'm telling

1820
03:18:05.76 --> 03:18:10.48
you got a rude awakening coming your way the it is leadership it's the same you want to

1821
03:18:10.48 --> 03:18:18.64
impose stuff on your children it's not gonna go well for you it's not so be careful that thing you

1822
03:18:18.64 --> 03:18:25.36
just there are said about the the example whatever where it's like oh yeah I use like this lesson

1823
03:18:25.36 --> 03:18:31.60
looked at myself for whatever you know anytime or I looked at it as no it's not them not doing the

1824
03:18:31.60 --> 03:18:36.48
right thing it's me not doing the right thing every single time hundred percent not the 99

1825
03:18:36.48 --> 03:18:42.88
maybe I'll come to you know you know hundred percent of the time it worked when I have a discipline

1826
03:18:42.88 --> 03:18:48.000
issue with my kids and then I do run the internal debrief or Iris gives me the debriefs

1827
03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:55.52
like I'm like how's it going check it's then it gets fixed and I'm like well this is what I

1828
03:18:55.52 --> 03:18:59.52
did wrong and this is what I need to do better next time I do those things next time and then
