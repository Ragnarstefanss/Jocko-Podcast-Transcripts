[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 291, with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
[00:00:08] Your responsibilities may involve the command of more traditional forces, but in less traditional roles.
[00:00:14] Men risking their lives not as combatants, but as instructors or advisors, or as symbols of our nation's
[00:00:20] commitments. The fact that the United States is not directly at war in these areas in no way
[00:00:26] diminishes the skill and the courage that will be required the service to our country, which is rendered
[00:00:33] or the pain of the casualties, which are suffered. To cite one final example of the range of
[00:00:41] responsibilities that will fall upon you, you may hold a position of command with our special forces,
[00:00:46] forces which are too unconventional to be called conventional, forces which are growing in number
[00:00:51] and importance and significance for we now know that it is wholly misleading to call this the nuclear
[00:00:58] age, or to say that our security rests only on the doctrine of massive retaliation.
[00:01:07] Korea has not been the only battlegrounds since the end of the Second World War.
[00:01:12] Men have fought and died in Malaya, Greece, the Philippines, Algeria and Cuba and Cyprus,
[00:01:21] and almost continuously on the Indo-Chinese peninsula. No nuclear weapons have been fired.
[00:01:28] No massive nuclear retaliation has been considered appropriate.
[00:01:34] This is another type of war. New in its intensity, ancient in its origin, war by guerrillas,
[00:01:41] subversives, insurgents, assassins, war by ambush instead of by combat, by infiltration instead
[00:01:50] of aggression, seeking victory by eroding and exhausting the enemy instead of engaging him.
[00:01:58] It is a form of warfare uniquely adapted to what we, to what has strangely been called
[00:02:04] wars of liberation. To undermine the efforts of new and poor countries to maintain the freedom
[00:02:12] that they have finally achieved. It prays on economic unrest and ethnic conflicts. It requires
[00:02:20] in those situations where we must counter it. And these are the kinds of challenges
[00:02:25] that will be before us in the next decade. If freedom is to be saved, a whole new kind of
[00:02:31] strategy, a wholly different kind of force and therefore a new and wholly different kind of military training.
[00:02:38] That right there was an excerpt from a speech by John F. Kennedy to the 1962 graduating class
[00:02:51] of West Point, the United States Military Academy, and that same year he also released a message
[00:02:57] to the US Army. And that message read to the United States Army. Another military dimension,
[00:03:07] guerilla warfare, has necessarily been added to the American profession of arms.
[00:03:14] The literal translation of guerilla warfare, a little war, is hardly applicable to this ancient
[00:03:22] but at the same time modern threat. I note that the army has several terms which describe
[00:03:29] the various facets of the current struggle, wars of subversion, covert aggression, and in broad
[00:03:35] professional terms, special warfare, or unconventional warfare. By whatever name, this militant
[00:03:43] challenge to freedom calls for an improvement and enlargement of our own development of techniques
[00:03:49] and tactics, communications and logistics to meet this threat. The mission of our armed forces
[00:03:57] and especially the army today is to master these skills and techniques and to be able to help
[00:04:03] those who have the will to help themselves. Pure military skill is not enough.
[00:04:12] A full spectrum of military paramilitary and civil action must be blended to produce success.
[00:04:21] The enemy uses economic and political warfare, propaganda, and naked military aggression
[00:04:27] in an endless combination to oppose a free choice of government and suppress the rights of the
[00:04:33] individual by terror, by subversion, and by force of arms. To win in this struggle, our officers and men
[00:04:44] must understand and combine the political, economic, and civil actions with skilled military
[00:04:51] efforts in the execution of this mission. The green beret is again becoming a symbol of excellence,
[00:04:59] a badge of courage, a mark of distinction in the fight for freedom.
[00:05:06] I know the United States Army will live up to its reputation for imagination, resourcefulness,
[00:05:13] and spirit as we meet this challenge, signed John F Kennedy.
[00:05:20] So, the Green beret, the U.S. Army Special Forces, were formed for this new type of warfare.
[00:05:31] Well, I guess as JFK said, new in its intensity but ancient in its origin.
[00:05:38] And today, almost 60 years since JFK made these statements,
[00:05:42] there's a new generation of soldiers that have trained
[00:05:45] incessantly to fight this new type of warfare and were honored to have one of those soldiers here
[00:05:51] tonight with us to share some of his experiences. He served in the U.S. Army Special Forces,
[00:05:57] worked as a contractor for some government agencies and has continued to hone his skills and teach
[00:06:04] others through his company Fieldcraft. Survival, his name is Mike Glover. Mike, thanks for coming
[00:06:12] out, man. Thanks for having me on its an honor. I have it to be here. Green berets, Green berets,
[00:06:20] the deal. We're kind of a big deal. I don't know if you can do that. Yeah, you know, obviously
[00:06:28] the seal community gets quite a bit of, you know, flack because we're like, uh, I guess for lack
[00:06:36] of a better word kind of popping the right now. Yes, but people seem to forget there was the green
[00:06:40] green beret, green beret movie way before and then I was thinking about the actual Delta Force
[00:06:47] movie the other day, which was way before anybody knew anything about the seal team. So so anyways,
[00:06:54] let's get to a man. Let's go back to the beginning. Let's go back to where, how you grew up, where
[00:06:59] you're from, what turned you into you? Who conception in Korea? Actually conceived in Korea, conceived in
[00:07:07] Korea. That was a Joe army kid. What did you do? So he had two of them, or else is he was a
[00:07:15] 95 Bravo, which is a military police officer and a Philadelphia artillery guy. What years was he
[00:07:21] 70, late 70s into the mid 80s? Okay, his, his intent was. Was he, did he go to nom? He didn't.
[00:07:29] He was, he was, he was in high school during Vietnam and then by time he got out the war had been
[00:07:34] fought. That was over. But he got stationed in Korea at some point. Yeah, I got stationed in Korea
[00:07:41] and met my beautiful mother at a very young age. She was 18 years old and then they had me at
[00:07:47] 19. How old was he? 25, 24 and just living his best life doing the army thing. We actually moved
[00:07:59] to California, to Fort Ord, California, where I was born and Monterey. Looks like a zombie apocalypse
[00:08:05] there now, the actual base for Ord. Looks like a sim shoot house. Did he get shot down? It did. They
[00:08:12] shut down all the buildings, condemned them, but it's still open. Like you could drive through
[00:08:17] publicly. So there's no gates. And station in Germany for a period of time with my dad as a young
[00:08:23] child and then parent separated. So got to come to Daytona Beach, Florida where I was basically raised.
[00:08:33] Going with who'd you go with? Monterey? Monterey? Monterey? Monterey? Monterey?
[00:08:37] Speaking of English, Medigay and Germany, wanted up getting back over to the US where I spent
[00:08:46] time between Florida and North Carolina, split in the difference growing up. Were you, were you looking
[00:08:52] at the army, like good deal? Were you around the army all the time when you're, when you're a little
[00:08:56] bit older? Yeah, it's like, you know, we live, you know, these civilian lives now, but there's
[00:09:02] always this evidence that we served in some capacity. So I saw that evidence as a child. My dad had
[00:09:09] the dog tags, the pictures, the moterey gear. I remember playing with his TA50, his old moterey gear,
[00:09:16] his mess kit and all of his LBE and all the old stuff that we had, the webbing. And I just kind
[00:09:24] of knew growing up in that environment that I was going to be in the military. His brother was a
[00:09:29] career, Navy guy. So I was, you know, growing up with Charlie Sheen and Navy Sills and Chuck Norris and
[00:09:38] Delta Force and kind of immersed in that and decided at a very young age. I mean, man, it's, it's,
[00:09:45] as young as I can remember, that's all I want to do. Was it an altering? Yeah, that's the same with me.
[00:09:50] I always say people like, when did you make that decision? I'm like, I don't know, because I just
[00:09:54] remember what wanting to wear camouflage uniforms as a little kid. Yeah, that's what I remember.
[00:10:00] But you were in mostly growing up in Daytona Beach. Yeah, Daytona Beach and then split in the
[00:10:05] difference between North Carolina and my mom actually settled right outside of Fort Brad,
[00:10:10] North Carolina, which I would spend a lot of time. What year were you born? 80. So you're growing up.
[00:10:15] So now this is like the 90s. Yeah. Yeah. It's weird. I'm sitting here talking to you and for some
[00:10:19] reason in my mind, I'm thinking I'm talking to like what like an older person. Yeah. And I'm thinking
[00:10:25] in my mind like, oh, it was the 50s. I don't know why I'm thinking that because because because
[00:10:30] okay, yeah, I guess because yeah, just read JFK, so I'm thinking, oh, yeah, this is the 50s. And
[00:10:34] then I started thinking myself, wait a second. This is like I was already in the Navy when you
[00:10:38] are freaking teenage or whatever. So you're growing up in the 90s. 90s. What year did you go in the
[00:10:42] Navy? 1990. 90. Okay. Yeah. I was 10. Yeah. That was 10. Wow. Wow. Now feel young all this sudden. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:10:51] Yeah. So what are you doing in Daytona Beach? What's the scene down there? Are you in the water?
[00:10:58] Are you surfing? Are you listening to music? What are you listening to? I was, I made my dad
[00:11:02] jokes and says that was a part fish because I was always in the water. I mean, I remember training.
[00:11:07] I wanted to be a Navy Sil, I first started thinking about the military. My uncle was very
[00:11:12] pro-Navy obviously. My dad was pro army and I remember jumping and diving into pools and doing
[00:11:17] underwater UDT challenges. Like tie-in knots. You know, there was no discovery channel or there was
[00:11:23] no representation, a mainstream of what Navy Sil's did. It was UDT was Charlie Sheen and Navy Sil's.
[00:11:30] So I wanted to do that, but I grew up in the water, outdoor fishing, I grew up on a boat.
[00:11:35] I mean, I think it was out. We probably fish four days a week. What was your dad's civilian job?
[00:11:41] So he immediately transfer from the military and work for the Department of Corrections for the
[00:11:46] state of Florida. So he started doing corrections at an early age, right out of the military,
[00:11:52] which transitioned his retirement, but if it's a whole bunch of cool stuff for him,
[00:11:56] and that's all our member him doing. And then, is he live? Do you see, is there another like,
[00:12:01] does he get remarried or something? Who's taking care of you when he's at work?
[00:12:04] Yeah, I mean, if I could reflect on that time period, I think I did a lot of taking care of myself,
[00:12:11] but I was super independent. I wasn't only child. So it was just making sure. You know, so
[00:12:15] growing up, I had a good imagination. It was very responsible as a kid. I don't remember getting
[00:12:21] trouble. I wasn't in bars. I wasn't into weed. All the typical things that kids are into. I remember
[00:12:28] like doing con-op, I concepted up the operation plans in brief as a 10-year-old. I had a toy
[00:12:34] MP5 and planning ops getting Gucci out and geared up and then doing these like low-vis operations
[00:12:41] at night. And then even a or I didn't even know what an A or was. And after action review,
[00:12:45] I would come back and like, let's talk about it. Like weird stuff. Who's we? Look, all my friends.
[00:12:49] Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I was just that kid. Yeah. I was that kid.
[00:12:53] Hey, did you? What about the fact that your parents got divorced? Did you? Did you have like
[00:12:58] anemosity towards your dad or towards your mom or were you just, did you just kind of,
[00:13:04] because when divorce happens at a young age, sometimes kids can't understand it. And it makes them,
[00:13:10] you know, I guess, have some kind of anemosity towards one parent or the other. It sounds like
[00:13:15] you were pretty maybe you kind of, because you can also, when you get older, you go, yeah, you know what,
[00:13:19] they just, you know, they did this when they were a little too young or they didn't get along or they
[00:13:22] weren't quite a good fit and I get it and we're going to carry on. Yeah. That was me man. I just never had a,
[00:13:27] I never developed anemosity for any of my parents based on the things they weren't potentially doing
[00:13:33] right. I don't know if it was because I always taught not to judge people and even my family
[00:13:38] and the circumstance I was in. What I looked at, it was a very adaptive opportunity for me to
[00:13:43] to go to different places, meet different family members and then have these cool experiences.
[00:13:49] I mean, I grew up in World Carolina with my cousins running the streets, doing playing war,
[00:13:55] shooting BB guns and then I come back to Florida and then I was hanging out my dad fishing
[00:13:59] outdoors on the beach in the water. And so I had a really good childhood. I despite the
[00:14:05] problem that was separation, which eventually at the age of 12, why did I move him back to my
[00:14:12] moms, taking advantage of opportunities there? What was the, what was the opportunity? So
[00:14:18] when I went, so my, obviously my mom and dad are in kind of like, cohoots and competition with
[00:14:24] each other because they want to have me, you know. And so I'm going back and forth, getting spoiled
[00:14:30] and separate ways. But I remember actually a summer of like when I was 12 or 13,
[00:14:35] my mom trying to convince me that, hey, you know, your dad just met a new woman, which he did,
[00:14:40] which was going to be my step mom, she had three kids at the time. And then it's an allocation
[00:14:45] of resources. And you know, when you have three new children in the home, you don't get taken care
[00:14:50] of like you used to. And so I was like, yeah, maybe I want to give my mom a chance and live with
[00:14:54] my mom and it's a good situation. So I just said dad, I'm, I'm just going to live my mom.
[00:14:59] And he was, I remember painfully, he was bummed out. I don't think I've ever heard my dad cry
[00:15:05] or saw him cry. And I think he was crying on the phone when I told him that. And it
[00:15:10] created a device, because I was his only baby boy. But he had children in the take care of,
[00:15:16] he had a new born with the woman that he was with. And I knew he had this life, he had this vertical,
[00:15:20] he had a concentrate on. So I live with my mom. And then, you know, in North Carolina, and she wasn't,
[00:15:27] she wasn't wealthy at all. She was an entrepreneur, small business, beauty salon. We were struggling.
[00:15:32] I thought it was going to be like, oh, this is cool because my mom buys me crap all the time.
[00:15:36] My dad never buys me stuff. And so I went into that opportunity and realized, hey, I mean,
[00:15:41] me and my mom were going to have to fend for ourselves. And we she with another guy at this point.
[00:15:45] She was, she was with my stepdad. She eventually met my stepdad at 15. She had a boyfriend at
[00:15:50] the time. Name Alex was a good dude from that she had met in Germany, had brought her over.
[00:15:55] But she was trying to find her way. I mean, I don't even think, and this is, this is
[00:16:00] uh, uh, honest reflection. I don't think I had shoes until I was like 14. Like I had flipflops.
[00:16:07] It was like, she didn't have a car to us 15. Um, because she couldn't afford a car. So we didn't
[00:16:13] have a lot of things that were basics because she was grinding as an entrepreneur. But that taught me
[00:16:18] more about life moving forward, being adaptive and eventually becoming a military leader. I think
[00:16:25] a lot of those experiences come from that. You know, you said, you said, first of all, it's pretty
[00:16:30] amazing how you were, um, kind of attach native, able to not be emotional about these decisions and
[00:16:35] stuff as a kid. You also said, hey, uh, I was taught not to judge people. Who taught you that?
[00:16:42] I grew up as a Baptist and, um, I wasn't, like, I'm not a super religious person. I never
[00:16:48] have them. But I've questioned, I'm a crying as a kid when I was in my bed trying to think about
[00:16:54] what the next step was for people. Like what happens when you die? I remember I actually,
[00:16:59] I remember this thought gives it stuck with me. I said to myself on my head, I said, wait a minute,
[00:17:04] if if a God's Jesus is father, then who's God's father? And there's this void in my brain. I'm like,
[00:17:12] oh my God, I can't figure this out. And I remember being destroyed. And so religion kind of brought
[00:17:17] that together for me. So I grew up like a Christian non-denominational and was taught a lot of
[00:17:22] values that way. Also my dad's a military-minded guy. So discipline, integrity, honor, all those things
[00:17:28] weren't still that many young age to. And then what, at what point did you, because you were in the
[00:17:33] water all the time, and it seems like that would be a good call to go in the Navy and, and try and
[00:17:40] go in the SEAL teams. What made you make the decision to go in the Army instead? Yeah, good question.
[00:17:45] I, I, I, I never been asked that, but specifically I know the exact moment. I was on my, the
[00:17:50] steps of my grandma's house and they don't a beach. And my uncle, who is still active Navy, had just
[00:17:58] come back from being on the water and in the fleet. And I was talking to him about being a Navy
[00:18:04] SEAL. And he said, listen, I know you're torn between the two. Do you want to be a green
[00:18:09] braid? Do you want to be a Navy SEAL? And if I were a kid, it's like, it's a choice, but you don't
[00:18:13] realize the progress that you have to go through. And so I'm like, so what happens if I fail?
[00:18:19] As a, if I go to selection and, or a good abuds, if I fail, what happens? He goes, you're
[00:18:24] mopping a deck forever. He goes, and then he told me about the whole recruitment. He actually
[00:18:30] tried out for buds and didn't make it when he was young in the Navy. And he said, hey, there's a
[00:18:35] whole bunch of guys I served with that didn't make it, that fill all the slots in the Navy, that
[00:18:41] nobody else wants to do. And I'm like, so what happens if I'm in the Army? And then my diet was
[00:18:46] there to educate me, says, listen, you could be an airborne ranger, you pass ranger school,
[00:18:50] you go to selection, you don't make it, you're still an airborne ranger, combat arms. And I'm
[00:18:55] like, why does one be in the fight? And I, I made the decision right there in that moment, it was like,
[00:18:59] okay, let me see the path that leads me to be a special forces guy. When I was 10 years old,
[00:19:04] I made a bet with my dad that I was going to be a green braid. Damn, better men in P5,
[00:19:09] better head of the team. I had to buy myself. You couldn't buy me a Phoenix arm's 22 right now.
[00:19:20] The fact that what, what the fact that you were able to calculate that is incredible,
[00:19:25] when I, I was freaking, you know, I was like, I think I was 18 when I joined, but I might have been 17
[00:19:32] on the maps program. Anyways, I was young, but I was older than you were at age 10, and I didn't even
[00:19:38] figure out that, hey, that, that thing never came into mind, mind what if you don't make it.
[00:19:43] Yeah, which is a stupid thing to be thinking, because there's a 80% attrition rate in Buds.
[00:19:48] And it's totally, it's, it's the worst. I mean, look, here, here's what's the worst. If you join the
[00:19:56] Navy because you want to be a mechanic or you want to be a work on aviation equipment, that's
[00:20:01] awesome. The, the Navy's freaking a great place to get those kind of jobs that are sort of like
[00:20:06] industrial blue collar jobs. The Navy's freaking awesome for that. You, you want to, like I said,
[00:20:10] you want to be a diesel mechanic, bro, go, go join the Navy. You'll get awesome experience of that.
[00:20:15] You want to learn about communication systems, technical stuff, the Navy's great, but the type of
[00:20:22] person that wants to be a seal doesn't want to do those kind of things at all, at least as far as I can tell.
[00:20:27] So, let that's what you're going to end up with. And so it's really a bad deal if you don't make it,
[00:20:33] it's not, not going to be fun. What's worse, too, you train up for that job before you,
[00:20:38] or the use to, right? You used to train up for that job. Yeah. So then what's a good thing is you see
[00:20:44] how much that job potentially sucks. Yeah. So when you go into Buds, that's your motivation. I don't
[00:20:48] want to go back to that thing, that vocational thing. No, it's, it's, and the other thing that's,
[00:20:53] that's really good about the army and the Marine Corps is you get all this fundamental basic
[00:20:57] infantry, small unit training before you go to special operations training. So in the, in the
[00:21:04] seal teams, you don't have that. You don't have this sort of base of knowledge of fundamental
[00:21:09] small unit tactics like you have in the army and in the Marine Corps. So how will you when you
[00:21:16] are less 17? Yeah. I joined us 17. And go to boot camp. Got what you expected?
[00:21:22] Yeah. I went to infantry boot camp where to sand hill became a 11 Bravo. I actually signed up to
[00:21:28] the an airborne Ranger, an option 40 contract, which is known as the option to go to Ranger
[00:21:34] Pétain. Oh, so that's, that means you're going to Battalion. Yeah. I was, I was so I set to go to
[00:21:39] Battalion. But what I signed up for as an MOS was called 11 X-ray. And 11 X-ray is similar to the 18
[00:21:46] X-ray. And where the X stands for, they filled the gap. They, they decide what they want to make
[00:21:51] you. So back in the day, it's not like this now. But back in the day, there was four different
[00:21:56] specialties in the infantry. 11 Bravo Charlie Delta and Mike. And, or not Mike, not Delta, but Mike
[00:22:04] and hotel. So if you were 11 Bravo infantrymen, if you're a Charlie, Mortarmen, if you're a
[00:22:10] Mike, like heavy-willed mechanized vehicles, if you're a hotel, heavy armor like Rodin on Humvees.
[00:22:16] So basically an infantrymen with different skill sons. Well, when I got there, the way they selected
[00:22:23] us in group does was based on where we were standing. So they said, hey, you guys in a group,
[00:22:28] you're going to be Bravo's. You mean, you're like literally standing, literally, you're not standing
[00:22:32] in your class rank or anything like that. Just wear your stand. Where you were lumped together.
[00:22:37] And so they're like, you lumped. You're going to be a Bravo, you know, and they made them
[00:22:41] molasses. Well, they made me an 11 hotel. And so I'm like, okay, so I'm going to infantry guy that
[00:22:47] drives and Humvees shoots 50 cows and toe muscles. Cool. What do this? At the end of basic training,
[00:22:53] where they transition you and they go to AIT where you get your advanced training. They're supposed
[00:23:00] to have a rip brief, a Ranger docturnation program brief. So the rip instructor comes and I'm like,
[00:23:06] what's going on here? Like he's not talking to us. He's talking to the Bravo's and the Charlie's.
[00:23:10] Like why is he talking to us? Don't even think anything about it because I'm like, I mean,
[00:23:14] you want, I don't even have a rank, right? And so no, no foot to stand on. So we go through the training
[00:23:20] and at the end, they go, hey, Mike, you're going to Fort Lewis Washington to an infantry unit.
[00:23:25] And I'm like, I have a Ranger contract, airborne Ranger contract. So they look at my
[00:23:31] Amosica, know your hotel. Ranger of a time doesn't have hotels. And I'm like, what? Like,
[00:23:36] what do you mean they don't have hotels? And like you should have told us before you were
[00:23:39] a day, I came like, I'm a private. I think I tried to say something, but you guys ignored me. So
[00:23:45] luckily for me, my uncle was a sergeant major and the 18th Airborne Corps, big division of
[00:23:52] airborne infantry units. So I call him during my little break and like this is what happened.
[00:23:58] So he gets this, you know, long story short, he gets this connection where this old guard recruiter
[00:24:04] comes in. And I'm in a room similar to this. And they're like, I know your uncle, I'm going to
[00:24:09] hook you up. Like literally the guy says it to me as a E5. And he's the recruiter for the old guard,
[00:24:14] the third infantry regiment, right? I don't even know the hell the old guard is. I'm like, okay,
[00:24:19] what do I got to do? And a civilian comes in and he looks at my orders, he's a
[00:24:23] Gamer orders and he looks at it. And my MOS has a love no hotel. He literally takes a pen
[00:24:28] and scratches out a love no hotel, writes 11 Bravo and then signs his initials boom.
[00:24:33] And it instant 11 Bravo. And I'm like, oh, and I'm like, okay, so am I going to be
[00:24:38] time and it goes, well, first we can't do that. We have to send you to the old guard because that's
[00:24:42] part of this deal. When we send you the old guard because you could only be 11 Bravo going the old
[00:24:48] guard. We're going to send you there and then you could put a 41 87. Everybody back in the day,
[00:24:53] even kind of now. So see, I 41 87 is the way that you migrate and do whatever you want to do,
[00:24:59] natural. So I get the old guard. No idea what the old guard is. And the long story short,
[00:25:05] they're ceremony unit of the US military. They do all the fall on our funerals, the state
[00:25:10] dignitarious courts. All the stuff I did not want to do. I had to take advantage of my time.
[00:25:17] This is pre-GWAT. So I'm like, I'm talking what like 97 97 97 97. So I get there and, you know,
[00:25:26] luckily for my circumstance, my uncle is very well known in these units. He served as a
[00:25:32] between start, does a storm. He's just a popular character in the inventory in this and these
[00:25:36] particular units. And the old guard for infantry guys is like a break. Yeah, you go to Korea, you go to
[00:25:42] the 82nd and then you go to the old guard to take a break. So I get there. E1 don't know anything
[00:25:47] and I realize it's not the place that I want to be, but I have to take advantage of my time. So I
[00:25:52] head on a trajectory to focus on setting myself up for success to be the best version of special forces
[00:26:01] that I could be. And so that's where that journey began. Did anyone tell you what to do? Was anyone
[00:26:07] talking to you about it? Was anyone telling you about selection or what you need to get ready for?
[00:26:11] Anything like that when you're reading about it? So I was so books or had been a big part of my
[00:26:16] life since the origins of where I wanted to be in the military. You know, the Marseinco books, the
[00:26:23] you know, the the Marine Sniper, all these books, John Plaster, Mac Pisaug, John Strikers stories,
[00:26:29] all these stories I was digesting and absorbing. I even stole and basic training a book called
[00:26:36] Commandos that was a paperback book from the drill sergeants, Paul Table Hall, while I was doing KP,
[00:26:43] I was cleaning crap up. And because I was like, I want to digest this. I was like hiding,
[00:26:48] doing that stuff. And so I had an understanding of what it took in discipline, but I had no idea
[00:26:56] because I didn't get any intel. As I got into the infantry, I maximized my time. I trained up for
[00:27:03] Ranger School. I went to Ranger School as an 18 year old PFC, a private first class. I went to
[00:27:07] Airborne School. How hard does it get a billet to Ranger School as an 18 year old? Almost impossible.
[00:27:12] How is it getting? So there's there's trials. Most infantry units run what's called pre-Ranger.
[00:27:19] And people think, hey, you raise your hand. You get a slot. That's not true. If
[00:27:23] you're a baton, it's a requirement. So they get the majority of the slots. If you're a regular
[00:27:27] infantry unit, you get slots based on order of merit. So they have an OML list. And if you
[00:27:34] earn it, they'll give you a slot. And then you're on the list. And then you just trickle your way
[00:27:38] to the top. So I tried out for it about 30 of us tried out for us and only three of us got slots.
[00:27:43] And I was a young PFC. What's it? What's the trial based on? Freak and PTC testing? It
[00:27:48] opens a sample here or something. What's harder than Ranger School? So it's about a week.
[00:27:53] Right? So in a week, it's like how much crap can we put together in a week to crush these kids
[00:27:59] dig to see who's most likely to succeed? Because these units have the reputation on the line.
[00:28:04] If the third image of your regiment sends five dudes to Ranger School and nobody passes, it
[00:28:08] reflects poorly on the on the regiment. So when I showed up, it was a rucksack. It was a, you know,
[00:28:16] a ruck march, 12 miles in time. It was land navigation. It was a common core task. It was patrolling.
[00:28:23] The number one thing that's going to make you successful is that your physical fitness in
[00:28:27] Ranger School. It's your ability to lead. And so as a young 18 year old at the time,
[00:28:32] I'm navigating this problem set. It's like, hey, PFC, Glover, give a warno. Give a con op. And I'm like,
[00:28:38] oh, like I have to brief this. So planning and then executing that raid was a reflection of your
[00:28:45] probability of success in Ranger School. So I was successful. And you're a PFC and there's 30
[00:28:51] people try out and you get selected. I got selected. Now I was one of one of three that I got selected.
[00:28:56] We went to Ranger School. I was actually the only one at the three that went all the way through
[00:29:00] without recycling. And in my infantry company, the only people Ranger Qualified was me as a PFC
[00:29:07] and my first sergeant who was a senior E8 in the army. So it was back then it was rare. I was
[00:29:13] rared to have a Ranger tab on your uniform. How was Ranger School? Kick in the balls, kick in the balls.
[00:29:23] Fear was the thing that I had to overcome. It was the most difficult thing that I had overcome.
[00:29:29] I remember like the night before Ranger School. Fear, I'm assuming fear of failure. Fear of failure.
[00:29:34] Absolutely. And you know, you have no perspective. You just have these stories. You know,
[00:29:41] my squad leader had been Ranger School before. So he was feeding me information, which almost makes
[00:29:45] it worse. You got to be aware of this and you're trying to live with that solution in mind.
[00:29:52] And you're getting hit with all these other random jobs in the face. I showed up and I'm super
[00:29:58] physically fit. And I remember getting my, um, I had a low body fat, high physical fitness score.
[00:30:04] And when I got there, I realized very quickly it wasn't about that. It was a, that's a,
[00:30:10] the Ranger Assessment part of Ranger School is relatively easy. I mean, it's we're talking
[00:30:14] eight minute mile pace, five miles, 40 minutes. We're talking about basic pushups, situps, and running,
[00:30:21] pullups, and basic stuff. Really quickly, you start deteriorating because you're not eating.
[00:30:26] Uh, you're averaging about one in our rear day when I went during winter time. And you're averaging
[00:30:31] about three and a half hours of sleep. Those difficulties for a dude. I mean, I went to Ranger
[00:30:36] School. I was even as an 18 year old at 200 pounds. All the guys that were meat heads that were
[00:30:42] big dudes suffered the most because you need protein to feed muscle. And when you're not getting
[00:30:48] that, your body starts deteriorating. And it's painful. How much weight did you lose? 30 pounds.
[00:30:54] 30 pounds. Yeah, that's a good time. Yeah. And that's another thing. Man, I might have taken the
[00:31:02] gamble. You know, they're like, hey, listen, Jocco, you might end up on a ship somewhere. But
[00:31:08] if you go to Ranger School, guaranteed you're not eating out of my, let me take a bubble.
[00:31:13] Roll the dice. Yeah. That's another ball game. That's the thing about buds. The thing about
[00:31:18] buds, you're getting fat, man. Yeah. And it's all you can eat. That's beautiful. Yeah. It's
[00:31:23] saved. It's why you jacked. That's huge. But the thing is Ranger School, like you said, Ranger
[00:31:30] School is really the premier leadership school for the Army. It is. Yeah. You're running operations.
[00:31:37] You're, you're, you're filling a different role. Basically, every operation. Sometimes you're the
[00:31:43] leader. Sometimes you're freaking machine gun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's, you know, when I went to
[00:31:48] Ranger School as a very young kid, I didn't know what to expect. And then it's Sinker Swim.
[00:31:55] You either step up to the plate and you're prepared to be, look, the characteristics of
[00:32:00] being successful, Ranger who aren't that difficult. But being a clear, concise, decisive leader
[00:32:06] under stress is super important. And I saw, and in front, for, you know, comparably to all my peers,
[00:32:14] which weren't peers. I'm talking about the second lieutenant that just graduated IOBC,
[00:32:18] infantry officer, basic horse, Navy seals, green berets. Like these are guys that are highly
[00:32:24] respect. So it was a whole plethora, like a melting pot of a whole bunch of different backgrounds.
[00:32:29] And I realized when you took away food, when you took away sleep, when you broke everybody down,
[00:32:35] we were on this equal plane. And so they're very minimal characteristics that you needed to be
[00:32:40] successful and to shine. We're not that difficult. And so I saw people, Sink and I saw people succeed
[00:32:48] because they swam. Those people that sunk were just, they couldn't make decisions. And then when
[00:32:53] they got stressed, which they never been tested and stressed, they couldn't do basic skills. That's
[00:32:59] right. So Ranger School, they give you the formula. And here's the conup. Here's the five paragraph
[00:33:04] op water. Here's how you execute a rate. Just follow that step by step and you'll be successful.
[00:33:10] And I realized how analytic that was. And so I just needed to get through and check the block and get
[00:33:15] it done. And I saw a lot of people Sink that I highly respected because they started falling apart.
[00:33:22] I mean, I saw guys who were beef, beefy dudes were jacked, who were strong. And they were getting
[00:33:28] broken down the most because they couldn't handle the deprivation of sleeping food. And when I saw
[00:33:33] that as a young man, as a young leader, it changed my entire perspective on life. Like it reprioritized
[00:33:40] the hierarchy of things that I thought were important. And I'm like, that's not important. Like a
[00:33:43] hit, like eating, eating and sleeping in the field to be able to conduct an operation are now
[00:33:49] the new priorities for me taking care of my guys. So I came out of that as a very young leader
[00:33:55] who wasn't even an, that was an informal leader. I wasn't even a designated leader. And that
[00:33:59] shaped me to become the leader that I would become. When you say people that would have trouble
[00:34:03] where people that would have in hard time making a decision. Like what would they be having a hard
[00:34:07] time making a decision? Like, hey, there's where we're going to put this over watch position or where
[00:34:12] we're going to set up the base element like those kind of decisions? Yeah, everything from technical
[00:34:17] to very cognitive decisions that had been made in adapting to change rapidly. So in Rainer School,
[00:34:23] you're going to set mission, which is based off your con up that you plan. It's a deliberate
[00:34:27] mission sent, contingency base mission sent. You go in the field with that and then after that,
[00:34:32] it's all fragos. It's fragmentation orders of the missions changing. We're doing this. And mostly
[00:34:38] how to do with the adaptability of adapting to rapid change. Hey guys, this just happened.
[00:34:43] Now you have the doubt what you're going to do. I have no idea. It was probably a lack of glucose
[00:34:48] in the brain. It was a lack of sleep. I mean, I had guys that broke down and like just quit.
[00:34:55] Because when you get to that state where you can't function mentally, what's going to get you through
[00:35:01] that? And typically it's grip. It's resolved. It's digging deep. And some of those guys never found that.
[00:35:07] And even though they were tested and they had an opportunity, they never found it. So when we
[00:35:12] came out of the field, the greatest thing about Rainer School is your judge by your peers.
[00:35:17] You write down on a piece of paper. At the like the second you come out of the field,
[00:35:22] your smoked out of your mind. They put you in a classroom. They sit you down with a piece of paper.
[00:35:27] And they say, write down a person you want to go to war with and write down a person you leave behind.
[00:35:33] And that's that's super impactful for a young man being told that they would be left behind
[00:35:41] by the majority of their peers. That's I mean, it's super impactful. Because it's like,
[00:35:46] hey man, adapt, change. Do some self reflection or fail. And just be that guy for the rest of your life.
[00:35:53] That that right there set the press and it's for everything. And in Ranger School,
[00:35:58] one of the ways that you could drop is by getting peered out, right? Where if you get, if you get
[00:36:02] ranked the lowest guy X number of times, then the instructors are like, yeah, this guy is not the guy
[00:36:07] that we want. If you get peered and it's becoming a routine out of the field, you will immediately get recycled.
[00:36:14] So a recycle isn't just like going back to the beginning of that phase. It's potentially going
[00:36:19] back to the beginning of Ranger School. So now you're talking about, when I went to Ranger School
[00:36:23] with 70 plus days, it was a couple months, three different phases when I went Darby,
[00:36:28] which is then the Fort Benning and San Hill, Delana Gow, which is in the mountains, and then
[00:36:34] at Eglend, which is in the swamps. So if you get recycled, you potentially will go back to the phase
[00:36:41] or go back to the very beginning. I mean, I interviewed a woman Lisa Jaster, who is one of the first
[00:36:47] females to go through Ranger School. She failed every phase. She got to the last phase and failed,
[00:36:54] and they said, you failed. So here's your options. It was a weird thing, knock out these push-ups
[00:37:00] because we get a assess if you're physically a fit to go ahead and go forward. If you don't knock
[00:37:04] him out and you can't meet that standard right now, you're done. But we're going to recycle you
[00:37:09] to the very beginning. So she was in a race over like a year. Like sustained combat operations
[00:37:15] and sleep and food deprived for like a year. And I can't imagine, but that was your options. It's
[00:37:20] either, again, it's either synchronous one. You have an opportunity to succeed and change the way you
[00:37:25] look at yourself, which I think is the most impactful that they give you that opportunity, or continue
[00:37:29] to be that guy, and then you just get shit canned. When are they helping people out by, let's say you
[00:37:35] get graded low? Isn't instructor going to be coming over to you and say, like, hey, listen,
[00:37:39] here's what's going on. You're really indecisive. You need to start thinking through these things.
[00:37:42] The reason I'm asking you this is because like in basic seal training. First of all, you're not
[00:37:49] doing anything really tactical. But second of all, there's no real hate, bro. Here's the mistake
[00:37:54] that you're making. Whereas the kind of training that I ran, which was like the advanced training,
[00:37:59] like the training that we do with platoons before we went to point it, right? I mean, that's all
[00:38:05] I'm doing this being like, hey, man, you can't be sitting there, being indecisive. You need to figure
[00:38:11] out what's your work, call you're going to make. You need to do at least give your guys some
[00:38:13] correction. Like, I'm constantly doing that to these guys. Is that happening at Ranger School?
[00:38:18] Or is it more like, yeah, you know what, this guy ain't got it. Yeah, I mean, here, the reality is
[00:38:23] they know if you're not going to make it. Your peers know the students know. There's guys who are
[00:38:28] made for war, and there's guys who aren't made for war. And one of the things that I think is
[00:38:34] important about the Ranger tab and the experience is you're creating combat leaders represented by
[00:38:39] a tab. Now, now we don't wear tabs necessarily all over the place because we're in different uniforms,
[00:38:46] but when you saw that tab, you understood that, that guy was capable as a leader in combat.
[00:38:51] And it totaled a lot. So a lot of the times, especially with the officers who come out at IOBC,
[00:38:57] they're brand new 22 year old, uh, second lieutenant. Don't give them the opportunity. And they'll
[00:39:02] say, hey, these are the fixes fix this. If you don't fix it, you're going to fail. You go to
[00:39:06] you report to your first duty station as an infantry officer without a Ranger tab, forget about it.
[00:39:10] Your career failed for the, you're just not, you might as well just get out. For, for a young
[00:39:16] Joe's like PFCs that I was for specialists or even young, uh, NCOs, not commission officers,
[00:39:22] you have an opportunity. They'll give you some feedback and they expect to see you, um,
[00:39:27] take that opportunity. You might not get another opportunity based on the cycle of getting patrols,
[00:39:33] which just means they're going to recycle. And you'll get another chance, uh, a month and a half
[00:39:38] later, because that's how long it takes to get through it. What's the nutrition rate at Ranger's
[00:39:41] goal? It's pretty high. It's about ID percent. Really. Yeah, that's about 80 percent.
[00:39:47] So you get, you get down with it. And now you must have a pretty freaking good reputation. What
[00:39:51] do you, are you 19 yet? I'm 19. Yeah. 19. You graduated from that. So what's next? So, um, my uncle,
[00:40:01] um, when I'm there, was a guard, the two with the unknown soldier. He was there as a guard. He was a
[00:40:08] battoon sergeant, um, before my time. And when I'm there, I put a 4180 something going to
[00:40:13] Ranger for time. It doesn't get accepted. They're like, no, I have a Ranger tab, which I thought was
[00:40:18] the prerequisite to get a 4180. They're like, no, uh, we don't, we don't need the numbers. And in
[00:40:23] 98, they didn't need the numbers. 99. And so I talked to my uncle, I'm like, what do you want?
[00:40:29] What are my options? Like, I'm ready to be in the fight, which there wasn't a fight. And that's
[00:40:34] probably the reason why I think you have 4187 approved. They're like, um, he's like, go, go
[00:40:39] try out for the two. And at the time, um, and still at that unit, the two million-known soldier
[00:40:46] was the most difficult. It's probably the most difficult thing I've ever done in my life to be honest.
[00:40:51] Selections and special operations comparatively were walking the park, compared to what that was.
[00:40:58] I went there. The army's been guarding the two of the unknowns since the, the 50s.
[00:41:04] It's been around since the, uh, in term of the World War I of known. And it was an honor.
[00:41:11] It was something that was going to build me and set me up for success, leading into,
[00:41:17] potentially, behind or special forces. And so I took the opportunity. I went and tried out.
[00:41:21] How long is the trial?
[00:41:23] So you typically do a two week trial. It's called TTY. They just, they TTY to the tomb.
[00:41:30] You do a whole bunch of assessments. And then they go, you're good enough or you're not to continue
[00:41:35] to select and try. And that's a seven in the nine month process. If you're smart, seven months,
[00:41:41] if you're not so smart, not once. So it took me like 10 months. So it took me a long time to get my
[00:41:46] earned my two-man-dentification badge. But the, the, the process is almost a year.
[00:41:50] And then what's that job in tail? I mean, obviously we know what it looks like from the outside.
[00:41:56] Yeah, garden the tomb. But what's it look like from the inside?
[00:42:00] It's a suckfest man. It's a suckfest. I mean, it's, it's the most difficult thing I've done.
[00:42:05] But the most honorable, uh, responsibility I've been given in the military.
[00:42:09] So the two-man-dentone soldiers who've been guarded by the army since the, the 40s.
[00:42:14] And they guard the tomb 24 hours a day, seven days a week. And that rotation takes place
[00:42:21] and three release based on height. First being the tall, second being the mid, mid guys,
[00:42:26] and third being the shortest, minimum six feet tall. And then you rotate basically a firefighter
[00:42:33] schedule. Day on day off, day on day off, day on and four days off all year round. You know,
[00:42:37] your schedule for three years in advance. And you typically guard if you're a guard, you have your
[00:42:42] badge during the summertime, seven walks a day, uh, 30 minute walks with a seven-minute guard change.
[00:42:49] And then about two to four hours of guard rotations at night. At night we don't do it in ceremony,
[00:42:54] uniform. It's typically class. I think bees at the time, more BDUs. And it's a roving patrol.
[00:43:00] Your job is simply to guard the tomb of the unknown soldier from desecration or disrespect.
[00:43:06] And we do that, uh, snow, sleet, he doesn't matter the weather. It's, it's just being done.
[00:43:11] What makes it so challenging to get through the, is it just like microscopic inspections of your
[00:43:19] uniforms and your hair and your freaking nose hairs and your hair here, your hairs and stuff like that?
[00:43:24] Yeah, it's, it's the attention of detail. Line six of the sit-less creed states, my standard
[00:43:28] will remain perfection. And so you build this culture around paying attention to every single
[00:43:34] facet of your military uniform, even your life, even your personal life, of being squared away.
[00:43:39] So I, I did that job and, um, you know, painful to be a new guy doing that job.
[00:43:47] But inspections of your uniform every single day, if not by the hour, they have a culture where you
[00:43:53] earn a walk. You don't just get a walk, you have to earn that walk. So you have to earn it by
[00:43:58] understanding knowledge, yet the verbate a memorized 28 pages of knowledge about the tomb of the
[00:44:03] unknown soldier and the history of our international cemetery. Because you're represented. If you're
[00:44:07] like, you can go down to do a tomb guard walk and front of 3000 people come inside the quarters,
[00:44:12] change and go out three minutes later and communicate the tomb of the unknown to whatever
[00:44:16] it presents to the US military. So it's a, it's a diplomatic position, not just a guard
[00:44:22] wearing a uniform walking back and forth. And so I remember, my first walk was in front of 3000
[00:44:29] people at 12 o'clock noon, CNN, Fox News, cameras weren't in my face. I remember hearing standing
[00:44:35] at poor arms hearing the band at rattle on my weapon. Because you're free to nervous because I was
[00:44:40] nervous. I was standing in for, I mean, I'm looking through AVator glasses that are in my peripheral
[00:44:45] and see people like inches from me, just staring at me and every movement during the
[00:44:51] gorge change has to be perfect. And it's intimidating. But it's a sharp learning curve. And again,
[00:44:58] it's a huge opportunity for me. So the training program or the selection program that you're talking
[00:45:02] about that, that's 10 months long. Are you working during that time? Are you doing any guarding?
[00:45:07] Or no. You're doing all the guard walks where there's nobody going to watch any. Early morning,
[00:45:13] late afternoon and everything at night. I even did what's called a visual because I wanted to get the
[00:45:18] hell away from the guys and I didn't want to get hazed and abused. I did visuals where I would work
[00:45:25] all day. And so I'm, you know, helping prep the guards, you know, forms doing early morning,
[00:45:30] late afternoon walks. And then at night, I'm taking when they cemetery closes at 7pm until 7
[00:45:37] in the morning, standing guard for 12 hours straight, no sleep and guarding just to get away from
[00:45:42] the guys. I was like breaking records of doing that. I was like doing 21 visuals back and back.
[00:45:47] So what was going on with the guys that was so bad? Was it just freaking all in your shit all day long?
[00:45:55] Well, the, so the, the two of the unknown soldier, the actual badge is the least awarded badge
[00:46:01] in the US military besides the astronauts badge because, you know, they're not a diamond dozen,
[00:46:06] military. So the, Tim guard badge is, is very, um, much protected by the Tim guard badge protectors.
[00:46:16] And so they don't want the right guys there or the wrong guys there, they want the right guys,
[00:46:20] and they, they want to make sure you earn it. And I did and back then, you know, hazing.
[00:46:27] We come from the military where hazing was normal. I mean, if you weren't hazed, you, you didn't
[00:46:32] feel like you were loved. Like, I got my EID, my airborne wings, my halo wings, punched into my chest,
[00:46:37] my every rank punched in my collarbone into the bone. And that was just the, the universe we,
[00:46:43] uh, evolved in. That was very much the case. Everything from running through the cemetery trying to find
[00:46:50] you know, inscriptions of, of specific people getting smoked to death, low crawl on across,
[00:46:56] you know, face down in the lawn, getting, you know, getting smoked, um, just routine hazing to make sure,
[00:47:02] hey, this is a work, work testing to evaluate you constantly if you want to be here.
[00:47:07] And it's something I guess is handed down in tradition. What's the award ceremony like when you finally
[00:47:12] get the badge? Not, not that big of a deal. I mean, it's pretty, I, I just saw a picture of it. I have
[00:47:18] a small four by six picture of it. And, um, the third relief or the third, if the true
[00:47:25] regimen commander comes down in 06 and he pins your badge on you in the morning. And typically you
[00:47:30] worked the whole night to take your, you take your badge test, which is a series of specific tests,
[00:47:35] including changing the guard at noon, uh, reading verbatim the 28 pages of knowledge,
[00:47:42] with no errors, being perfect. And a written test all kinds of stuff. And then you get your badge
[00:47:48] pin and, you know, I'm badge 470 out of probably about, uh, almost 600 badges today.
[00:47:56] Then how long did you have that job for? Not long. I did it for about a year and a half
[00:48:00] afterwards. And then so for a year and a half after you went through nine months of this shit,
[00:48:06] yeah, they're like, okay, and this is what you're doing. That's your job. That's your job.
[00:48:10] And how did you like it? So I love the honor of the duty.
[00:48:15] Um, but it's not what I wanted to do in the military. I, you know, one thing we had to do is maintain
[00:48:22] our, um, common core skill sets. So we would come out of the field and those three days down,
[00:48:28] we do med training, we do raids, patrolling, we had to maintain all these things. So you get the
[00:48:34] inventory experience as a part-time position representing the army in a full-time position.
[00:48:40] And it's not what I sign up for. I mean, I was trying to be the best that I could be,
[00:48:44] be all you could be was the model back then. But it's not what I sign up for. And then nine
[00:48:49] eleven changed everything for me in that, in that situation. But where were you stationed when nine
[00:48:55] eleven went down? So I was, so I got out of the army. My first, uh, rotation of four years.
[00:49:02] September 3rd of 01 was my ETS day. Get out of our update. I transitioned into the National Guard
[00:49:09] because I was going to college and was a squad leader in the inventory. What was your plan? Like
[00:49:15] federal Bureau of Investigation HRT? I was like, if there's no war, if I can't get into
[00:49:20] the Italian, I'm going to get my college degree and I'm going to go, I'm going to be a sniper in
[00:49:24] HRT. Um, and that was my, my sights were set on that. And when nine eleven happened, it was a week
[00:49:31] after my ETS. And how old are you now? 21. So you're 21 years old. You get out on September 3rd,
[00:49:39] September 3rd is when I left the army. Okay. So then what do you do? So September 11th comes.
[00:49:48] Now you're freaking, you got to go and go and be a jerk. I'm freaking out. Like, when September 11th
[00:49:53] happened, I was the National Guard and I knew the nasty guard was going to get mobile last.
[00:49:58] And I'm like, I'm not going to work these to no offense to the National Guard. But I'm like, I
[00:50:01] did not go into work these dudes. I immediately, like I took, I was at college in the cafeteria
[00:50:07] in Fateful, near Fort Braggon, Carolina, when this happened. I went home and threw my battle dress
[00:50:13] uniform in the washer and started packing my stuff because I'm like, we're going to war. This is it.
[00:50:19] And immediately, I started making phone calls and they're like, yeah, and do another man.
[00:50:22] Nothing's going on with us right now. Stand by to standby. And I'm like, I have to make moves.
[00:50:26] So I started reaching out to recruiters and very rapidly, got back in the military and went straight
[00:50:33] to selection. We straight to Greenbrake. Was it hard to get to go straight to selection?
[00:50:36] They don't have to been lines out the door at that point. In impossible. I was a, I was a 20 year old
[00:50:42] E5. I mean, I made sergeant at 20 years old Airborne Ranger qualified with a tomb guard badge.
[00:50:47] And when I showed up to recruiter, he looked at me like I was a 16 year old kid who wanted to play
[00:50:53] Army. And I was like, is there's not a thing. And at that time, they hadn't even worked out this whole
[00:50:59] thing where guys who were prior servers come back in and serve. And I'm like, dude, I just got out last
[00:51:04] week. And he's like, sorry man, you gotta start over. And so I'm duck walking barefoot with a whole bunch of
[00:51:10] teenagers, I'm trying to get back in the Army. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, oh, because you had to go back
[00:51:14] through like the recruiting process or very beginning. I mean, I had to go to basic AIT. I had a
[00:51:19] ranger task. I don't have to do any of that stuff. But I had to go back through the Army and
[00:51:23] processing system called 30 F.A.G. From the beginning. I'm duck walking and I actually went to
[00:51:30] the recruiting station, which is called maps is where they had processed you in military uniform.
[00:51:37] And I remember they brought us on the room and everybody stripped down. And guys are looking at me.
[00:51:42] And I'm battle dress uniform stripping down and they like, what is this dude doing? Like,
[00:51:47] isn't he a recruiter? Like, what is happening? And I'm, you know, in my boxer briefs, like everybody
[00:51:52] else duck walking and doing all my little drills to get back in the Army. And then you go straight to
[00:51:57] selection from there. So I went through a program basically in 18 next-rate program and I had a
[00:52:03] try out where special operations preparation course they evaluate like they did in me in
[00:52:09] ranger school and said, hey, is this kid? Is there a probability that he's going to be successful?
[00:52:15] Let's evaluate him in land nav. Let's rock him. Let's p-t-m. And if he's good, we'll give him a slot.
[00:52:21] And so that's prep you just said prep. It's basically the preparation for
[00:52:28] giving guys slots to go to selection because they just want to throw you into selection and have
[00:52:32] you fail. They're setting you up for success. And so I quickly evaluate and they're like,
[00:52:37] hey, the streets ready. Let's send him now. How long is that little evaluation?
[00:52:41] A week. Okay. It's not straightforward. And then you go to selection and selection.
[00:52:49] This initial selection is only a few weeks long, right? When I went out to selection, it was 21,
[00:52:54] 22 days. Yeah, a few weeks. And this is just sort of weeding people out. Yeah. And so you
[00:53:01] make it sure you want to be there. Yeah. I mean, at the time you had to have, and you had to have
[00:53:06] three years in the Army. So you're talking about experience, typically in CO's, not commission officers,
[00:53:10] or junior-listed guys who have experience in the military. And you show up. It's a week of assessment,
[00:53:16] land-of, all these gates to make sure that you're good to go. And then it's team week. It's basically
[00:53:22] a little mini version of how week. And then they do the long-range movement. The long-range movement
[00:53:28] is what gets everybody. It's the land navigation leading into a long-range movement, where they
[00:53:33] assess your ability as an individual to learn a skill set and then in the wood line alone execute
[00:53:40] that skill set to be successful. And that skill set is just land-of. Land-of. We need to be there.
[00:53:45] It's our trick. It's like you guys' water we use land and hate can you hump for a long period
[00:53:50] of time duration, day, night, and keep movement and can you find your points? And just like the
[00:53:56] water, there's a lot of people who can't. You know what I'm saying? I mean, it's it to me,
[00:54:00] it's like walking, it's very primal, and a lot of people fail. Yeah, you put that rucksack on. It's
[00:54:07] nittyg. Not quite rocket anymore. Yes. Yeah, it sucks the life out of you for sure. What about the first
[00:54:14] I've always found like the first 17 minutes with a rock animal. I was like, oh yeah, I remember this
[00:54:19] shit. Yeah. Where your body starts to warm up and everything hurts and then you start moving.
[00:54:25] I've always been a good rocker that's always been my strength. And so I'd never had a hard time
[00:54:30] with rocking my feet. We're hard. My back was good. So I didn't have a difficult time with selection.
[00:54:38] But what I saw as a lot of guys weren't prepared for that level and duration of movement,
[00:54:44] and it just broke them down. What are you doing today? In those in that selection where you did
[00:54:48] what a week of rocking. What do you think you're doing today? On average, 16 to 10 kilometers per movement
[00:54:56] per gate. So it depends. You start that whole entire process. Here's the philosophy behind it.
[00:55:05] We're going to start moving you and get you on your feet. And then we'll give you an 18 mile or
[00:55:10] a 20. I think the average is a 20 something plus mile or so. So you're broke when you start.
[00:55:15] And then we'll move you for a long period of time and see it's all a test on preparation,
[00:55:21] by the way. It has nothing to do with the actual assessments. It has everything to measure whether or not
[00:55:27] you prepared in advance. And so what they want is the guys who've prepared in advance. And so at one point
[00:55:34] for the long range movement, which is 30, probably 30 plus miles over a period of 24, 48 hours,
[00:55:41] you're not stopped moving. And if you bed down for a period of time and you sit down each
[00:55:45] hour and rack out and you're not timing yourself appropriately, you just fail. And so you have to
[00:55:51] meet these gates, but it's all it's all on your own. And that jacks up people's minds. When somebody
[00:55:57] comes into a room and writes down exactly where you got to be, what uniform you got to be in,
[00:56:02] and what time you're moving. That independence and setting off with no destination to mind.
[00:56:09] Hey students, I want you to get ready, get your truck on. We're going to move until you
[00:56:13] tell you to stop. That immediately destroys people's mindset off the gate because they're like,
[00:56:18] what do you mean? So they go off the gate, they start spreading and they don't paste themselves
[00:56:22] and they burn themselves out. Or they're so insecure with the circumstance, they impose
[00:56:27] they self-induced all the stress and then they quit. And you're like, you're self-selecting because
[00:56:32] you don't have the exact parameters of what you're going to be doing. That's how war is.
[00:56:37] I mean war is, hey, we might be flexing all night. We might be flexing all year, who knows?
[00:56:43] And that uncertainty and a lot of people breaks people down. And they ring out or whatever,
[00:56:48] what do they do? How do you quit in the selection? So in selection, in periods of time,
[00:56:56] you go back to your barracks. And when I went to selection, it was a piece of plywood,
[00:57:00] no pillow, and you have a bunk that has no pad, nothing, nothing comfortable.
[00:57:06] You go to sleep in the morning and you wake up and half of your entire crew that you
[00:57:11] went to bed with is gone. And you're like, what? And so what people are doing is getting up,
[00:57:16] they're leaving, knocking on the hut and this self-select, like literally saying, I'm done.
[00:57:21] I'm out. You have to voluntarily withdraw and have a conversation in order to check on a selection.
[00:57:29] Yeah, there's something I've always found about being out in the field and Humping,
[00:57:33] specifically, there's two things that come to mind that I've been talking about this lately,
[00:57:39] from just like a leadership perspective and just at my own personal mindset is, I'm very aware
[00:57:45] of time. I'm very aware of time. I can always feel time creeping up on me. I can always feel time,
[00:57:51] like people think, oh, we'll be able to make it. We can we can rest a little longer. And I always
[00:57:57] had that sense that, oh, actually no, it's not, we're not going to make it. In fact, we need to
[00:58:01] leave now if we're going to make it or we're sitting there trying to come up with a plan. I said,
[00:58:05] you know, we need to start moving forward. We can't spend any more time playing. It's time to go.
[00:58:09] I always had that sense of time and I still do. And it's almost a level of paranoia.
[00:58:14] It's something that always is in the front of my heads up display, right? My heads up display is
[00:58:20] always going, hey, wait, check your time, check your time, check your time. But that reminds me
[00:58:24] of being out on patrols, whether total dick drag or patrols, where you're carrying a shit
[00:58:30] ton of weight and you're going really far. And you still got to get to the target on time.
[00:58:36] And the, the, the intrinsic motivation that it takes. Because once you sit down, you take that
[00:58:45] load off and you see the guys all freaking sitting in a crappy perimeter and just they'll sit there,
[00:58:51] they'll sit there indefinitely. Like, like you take a platoon out and, and they've got,
[00:58:57] they're, they're, they're, they've, they've been crushed for a five, six, seven hour patrol.
[00:59:04] They won't get up unless you're like, hey, boys, we gotta go. And if, if you don't do that,
[00:59:11] if somebody doesn't do that, somebody doesn't say, hey, guys, it's time to get up and go,
[00:59:14] there's no, there will be no movement. We'll, we'll happen. They'll, they'll not hit that target.
[00:59:18] They'll, okay, we couldn't make the target. That's what will happen. People accept that. Like,
[00:59:22] yeah, you know what? Yeah. And, and so having that, having that intrinsic will to say,
[00:59:29] look at your watching go, you know what? We, we said 10 minute break. It's been nine minutes.
[00:59:34] Hey, boys, get ready to roll. That's a big deal. Yes. That's a big deal. Yeah. I think part of the,
[00:59:40] you know, like you say discipline is freedom, part of that freedom is control that you have
[00:59:44] self-control. If you understand what you have to do to be discipline, to make gates, to meet
[00:59:50] time hacks, then you have control. You're offensive. You're thinking proactively. And a lot of
[00:59:55] guys don't have the discipline to do that. It's, it's, it's, it's real crazy to see that something
[01:00:00] so simple, a task, so common core can weed the masses and evaluate who's going to succeed
[01:00:09] with the combination of aptitude and discipline versus who's not. Yeah. And like you just said,
[01:00:14] what it really boils down to is when you're tired, when you're sore, and when you don't know
[01:00:20] how much longer this is going to last, do you have what it takes to put your rock back on,
[01:00:25] stand up and start walking again. It's it. Yeah. You wouldn't think it's something that
[01:00:31] that freaking simple, so simple, so primal too. So you get through selection. And then you hit the
[01:00:38] Q Course, hit the Q Course as a 18 Bravo, special forces weapon is guy going to third special
[01:00:46] forces group. Any, any highlights out of the Q Course? No, I think that you know, in the lead in
[01:00:54] talking about JFK and the representation of how we wanted to establish this irregular and unconventional
[01:01:00] means of warfare, I learned that truly from the long duration that I was in the Q Course.
[01:01:07] I went to Robin Sage, merely weeks after Robin Sage, after that experience, I was
[01:01:15] living that training in Afghanistan and remote firebase. So Robin Sage, which is an exercise,
[01:01:22] basically living unconventional warfare and an environment which is rocking him, North Carolina,
[01:01:28] the surrounding area, where all the civilians or subcontractors and bought into this whole thing,
[01:01:33] it's elaborate scenario was so impactful for me. I mean, it's crazy. Yeah. So just to give a little
[01:01:39] background on the, so the mission of the Green Braids of Special Forces is to go out and work with
[01:01:46] indigenous forces, get them trained up, get them organized so that they can fight by themselves
[01:01:53] or with very little guidance from the, from the Special Forces, and eventually with no guidance at
[01:01:57] all. That's the, that's the mission. So the, you guys do this big exercise, it's sort of,
[01:02:04] is it like the final exercise that you do? Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. And it's called Robin Sage and you
[01:02:08] go out and you have, quote, indigenous forces, which is really just the local populist inside this
[01:02:14] town and you have to train them and you have to work with them and you have to get information
[01:02:19] from them and set up targets and the whole nine yards because that's what the primary mission
[01:02:26] of Special Forces is to go do that. Yeah. It's by with through its foreign internal defense.
[01:02:31] It's been newly coined counterterrorism, foreign internal defense based on the words that we're in
[01:02:36] now. But it's the idea of, you have to build relationships and rapport with indigenous people,
[01:02:42] with forces. You just can't go and do deliberate actions only. You know, SR, DA, HR, those things
[01:02:50] are complementary to a strategic plan. The strategy is we have to win the hearts and minds. So
[01:02:55] when I went to Robin Sage, you had West Pointers, like junior West Pointers. We had
[01:03:00] role players from the military that are interweaved in this scenario where you can't just go into
[01:03:06] this circumstance and treat them with a military mind. You have to break bread with them. You
[01:03:12] have the drink tea with them. You have to learn about their family and build this relationship
[01:03:16] because you have to trust these guys on target. And so that's what I really took away from Robin
[01:03:22] Sage was this opportunity to learn and grow and culture and then build that relationship, which
[01:03:29] meant we're building a bond where we could fight side by side and the width portion of it
[01:03:35] and find it fixed and finish these bad guys together in powering the host nation that we're
[01:03:41] doing warfare with. That's super important because the translation of going into war
[01:03:48] was exactly that with the circumstance with Afghanistan at the time. And you know, like I
[01:03:53] wanted this scenario as I built conduit and a chicken coop and a chicken house for six hours with
[01:03:59] this guy and I'm like, I'm like, look at the other dude, I'm with him. Dude, what's going on?
[01:04:03] Like, what are we doing right now? Are we just, are we actually just doing a tasking and just
[01:04:08] hoping this dude up because it's we got to pass it to this and then at the end of that six hours
[01:04:12] we heard a noise and I'm like, it's all coming together. We put our info, we ran into the woods,
[01:04:17] put our in force together out of her backpack and ambush these two dudes who were interrogating
[01:04:21] and bullying this farmer and I'm like, this is so awesome. I mean, it's still long, it's a long
[01:04:27] burn but it was so awesome as an experience. And then you, so you get done with anything out
[01:04:32] in the Q-course stands out. Not survival school. I mean, survival school got my ass handed to me.
[01:04:37] I mean, it's the first time that I, I mean, how long is the survival school? It's pretty long.
[01:04:44] I mean, it's probably a few weeks when I went through it was like a escape, like a survival
[01:04:48] block. Yeah, it's a, a CRC, the high-ressee, a sea version, what you guys have gone through. And then,
[01:04:55] you know, you escape, you evade and then you go into the RTO and just get your ass handed to you.
[01:05:00] And, and again, you learn very rapidly that we're not all created equal in our capacity to deal with stress.
[01:05:09] And I, I don't find with it. I mean, I grew up fighting, I grew up in martial arts. I grew up doing
[01:05:15] all these things, which set me up for success there to go, hey, man, this is an exercise.
[01:05:20] Learn from this experience. Wait, what martial arts did you grow up in? Ninjitsu
[01:05:24] before straight up Ninjitsu, who wants something? Dude, I, my first instructors were all green
[01:05:30] brazen for Brad North Carolina, who opened a Ninjitsu school active and former SF guys.
[01:05:36] And it was gangster. We were doing stuff like my mom once.
[01:05:40] I, I, I did do have them shoes with the toe cut out, yeah. Look at you, you're like how
[01:05:45] you're like sure kidding. So how do all the free thoughts? The toners, yeah, you were just
[01:05:49] getting it. It was crazy. I was wondering who is buying all that stuff out of the back of freaking
[01:05:52] know, black belt magazine. I had a lot, it was, it was, I had all the red knives all that it was
[01:05:58] crazy. It, it was, it was a cool experience because my guys that were the instructors were all green
[01:06:05] and burrace. And so they like you do like a lot of guys with our experiences do,
[01:06:11] try to impart those experiences and impact on young people. And so they were doing the same with me.
[01:06:16] So I felt like I was mentored by these green burrace. Once I wanted to do a class
[01:06:21] and my mom dropped me off and for my mom to be paying for this courses a big deal.
[01:06:26] She dropped me off and she saw the instructor put me in front of a mirror.
[01:06:30] She came back an hour and ten minutes later and I was still standing in front of the mirror.
[01:06:36] And she was pissed off because she's like, I'm paying for my son. Why are you doing? Why are you only
[01:06:41] having a stand there? It's an assessment. And I stared at myself for an hour and meditation.
[01:06:46] I'm like, what the hell? I learned a lot about myself in that hour. It's crazy.
[01:06:52] Alright so back to back to, did you stay away before we go there? Did you guys fight each other in
[01:06:58] Ninja 2 school? A lot. It was aggressive. A lot of dudes got hurt. I think it was a lot.
[01:07:05] Before, what year was this?
[01:07:07] 93, 94.
[01:07:09] I don't see you have a lot of stuff.
[01:07:11] Yeah, that's coming out. Yeah. People were, this is during the revolution. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. It was a lot of,
[01:07:16] I mean there were, I mean Ninja 2 has, and this Japanese form has a lot of traditional
[01:07:21] uh, jujitsu type moves on the ground, but it's not ground game. So you are move, yes. It's a singular
[01:07:29] move. It's a singular. That's the problem. That is the problem. That's a inherent problem with that.
[01:07:34] And so I, I learned a lot about discipline from that experience, but it made me harder.
[01:07:39] So when I went to survival school, I was just prepped, man. I was good. I, and it wasn't a
[01:07:44] difficult thing, but I saw dudes fall apart. And when I went to survival school, it was the last
[01:07:49] thing that you did in the Q course. If you failed, you failed everything. You just, you just spent
[01:07:56] two years of your life training to be a greenbrae, and they let dudes go, how many people fail?
[01:08:00] Half. We'd have a couple per class. I mean, it was common. We have a couple per class. That would
[01:08:05] self select, and they were like, I'm done. You're like, you just a teacher. We're just making them
[01:08:09] quit. The stress, man. Well, it's stressful. Well, I mean, getting like, even just a hood,
[01:08:14] like people aren't used to taking, if you, if you, if you don't grow up in those martial arts,
[01:08:18] if you don't grow up in impact sports, and that used to make in contact. When that hood comes
[01:08:23] off your head, and you get slapped by dudes, hands who are like pickle fingers, and he slap
[01:08:29] your face, and you can't do anything, that starts breaking you down. And by, you know, day two of
[01:08:36] that experience, you know, laying naked in your cell, flux cuff, and a box, you, you, you, a lot
[01:08:41] of guys sell select. I thought it was, I was into claustrophobia. I like being a small place. I,
[01:08:49] I hid, I slept, and I was like, this is awesome. Just keep me in this box.
[01:08:53] Man, I got slapped so hard when I got captured at Sierra School. The, it surprised me.
[01:08:58] Yeah. Like, it was, I mean, this guy freaking out and nowhere. The hood comes off. I'm standing
[01:09:05] up against the wall. It's out in the middle of the woods, and they have like a wall. And I
[01:09:08] think it's almost like a Hollywood wall where it, when you get pushed into it, it kind of
[01:09:12] gives a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. So he pushed me into it once, and like whatever, I must
[01:09:17] add some kind of punk ass freaking smirk on my face like whatever. And this dude did not like it at
[01:09:22] all. E-core, cracked me. I mean, I'm talking as hard as a human being, and I mean, I've been punching
[01:09:29] the face. It was like that, but he hasn't happened to be open. And I, I, I just got the little,
[01:09:34] got the little flash, and I was like, oh, Dave. This is real. I was like, yeah. And believe me,
[01:09:39] that was that was number one because he followed that one up. Yeah. But I, like you, I can't
[01:09:47] imagine that that would have made me quit. But I guess there's someone's not used to, you know,
[01:09:52] maybe scrapping or whatnot. That's it. Yeah. A lot of people quit. Not really for them. Yeah. I had
[01:09:57] what, the interesting thing in this psychology was, you're playing, you have to be resistant. Right?
[01:10:03] The whole game is your resistant. I remember we were building in the sand, a sickle that represented
[01:10:10] the communist, you know, scenario. And we were building the sickle and have of us were sabotaging
[01:10:18] the sickle. So guys would make it. And I remember I had a guy who I highly respected he was
[01:10:22] but tuned started the infantry, had gone through training with me. I was scooting all the stuff out
[01:10:27] after they were building it, knocking it over. And he turned around and he walked to me because
[01:10:32] why are you doing? I'm like, what do you mean what are you doing? Dude, I like worked an hour on that.
[01:10:38] I'm like, wait a minute, you realize that we're supposed to be subverting this whole circumstance.
[01:10:44] Like you're not supposed to actually be making this. And he's like, oh, and he was in the scenario,
[01:10:50] man, freaking bridge on the river. Quiet. Oh, dude, it was insane. Right. Some of these guys were like,
[01:10:54] the headlights. I mean, they had the deer and the headlights look and they thought for real,
[01:11:00] they were in the back country of Vietnam. I mean, it was it was crazy. It was crazy to see.
[01:11:05] It was cool. Cool experience. Yeah, get, get, get, go ahead. What kind of claustrophobia stuff did
[01:11:12] they? A lot of it was, this this guy right here is kind of claustrophobic. Yeah, we've been working with them.
[01:11:18] Yeah, yeah, exposure is the way to deal with that. But it's they had, I mean, it was it was very
[01:11:24] tight, secluded spaces where you couldn't sit down on your butt and you couldn't stand up all the
[01:11:30] way. So you're in a uncomfortable stress position and then they would close the box on you and turn
[01:11:35] up lights and then they play the music like crying babies, all kinds of different stuff. And
[01:11:41] a lot of people, they would transfer you in a different box is based on your fear. So if they saw
[01:11:47] the fear coming out of you, they were exploiting that fear. They're like, oh, this dude in a big
[01:11:50] box is getting scary. Let's put him in a small box. And so it varied from small boxes to big boxes.
[01:11:58] But that jacked up a lot of people. I mean, it was it was significant. And then how long
[01:12:03] do you have to stand there? So a long time. You lose track of time because you're sleep deprived.
[01:12:09] Here's one story. I, I thinking I was a smart guy. I, I was like similar to the, I have to piss
[01:12:17] right now, but I had a piss really bad. And so I'm like, if I piss in this box, they're going to hook
[01:12:23] me up. I can't piss in this box. So this is my, I'm thinking logically, I think. And I'm like,
[01:12:29] this is completely logical. We, so hook me up is a bad thing. Hook like, like, pull me out of the
[01:12:34] thing and slap you. And slap my face off my face. And I'm like, look, I'll piss in my boot.
[01:12:41] And then I'll take it outside and we're in the gravel. I'll dump the piss off.
[01:12:45] Forgetting about this whole thing called displacement, right? I pee in my boot. I take off my
[01:12:50] boot. You don't have socks. Your naked get these bare pajamas on. I fill my boot with piss.
[01:12:57] And then I'm like, okay, I got it in here. I feel good. It's not all of a thing. And then I put my
[01:13:02] foot back in the boot. Damn. And then it goes everywhere. And I'm like, and then immediately occurs to me,
[01:13:07] like, that was a horrible idea. It's, I'm standing in piss. And then my foot, my naked foot is covered in piss.
[01:13:14] And I'm like, dude, that did not work out. I had a plan. That was not how I thought I was going to
[01:13:19] execute. It was a horrible man. It's funny because as you've thinking about that, I was
[01:13:24] you were talking about that. And then when you asked that question echo, you know, there's some,
[01:13:28] look, I don't know if this is some, you know, just straight up, Sam Harris meditation type
[01:13:34] scenario. But you get your brain where you just aren't there anymore. You're just like,
[01:13:40] cool, you're putting the box cool. Then you're sitting there and you're thinking about
[01:13:43] freaking whatever Kentucky fried chicken and lemonade. And you're just in a totally different world.
[01:13:50] And you don't know if it's been an hour or five hours. And you're getting slapped. It's like,
[01:13:56] cool, whatever. Like, whatever they're going to do to you. You just sort of, and it's the same thing
[01:14:01] when we were talking about, homo and rock, it's like, okay, look, there's just, I'm not, the pain is there,
[01:14:06] but it's like somewhere else. It's like, it's almost like you're watching it happen and you kind of
[01:14:09] can be like, yeah, whatever. Hey, keep going. Yeah, completely, your, your, your sedated man.
[01:14:15] You're just going with the flow. It's, it's similarly to, I think about when you accept at some
[01:14:20] point when you're in water that you're just going to pass out and you accept that. You're like,
[01:14:25] I'm okay with that. That bridge in that gap and just accepting it is the, the first part
[01:14:31] and being successful in that environment. And then you, like, you create your new happy place
[01:14:36] where you're like, man, it's long as I'm in my head and I have this space that I'm comfortable with.
[01:14:41] I'm good. You could do whatever you want. You're nothing you do to do. Yeah, if you are present
[01:14:46] in the shit that you're going through, yeah, that's got a suck. I can't even, I can barely even
[01:14:51] relate to it because I, I think, eventually you just get good at being like, okay, I call whatever,
[01:14:56] that's what we're doing, cool, whatever. I can't, it's got a, that's what, that's, you know,
[01:15:00] that when I start thinking about what makes someone quit, it's because they're present in that
[01:15:04] shit that's going down. They're actually in it. Yeah. And now they in it, they're looking at the
[01:15:09] future going. It's just more shit in the future. So, oh, this is horrible and forget it. I'm going
[01:15:14] to ring out. Yeah. It's that fair response. It's the comped inflation of impending doom. You're
[01:15:19] just thinking about the next thing that's coming and then your whole life is all these little
[01:15:24] small progressives of like, doomsday, doomsday. It's like, dude, I'm, I'm on the beach,
[01:15:30] drinking a painting colata, eating a piece of chicken right now. I'm, I'm, I'm living my best life in my head.
[01:15:36] And I'm good. You must have learned some of that. The tomb situation because that stuff
[01:15:41] doesn't sound fun to me. I would rather go through serious school 20 times right now than, yes,
[01:15:46] you uniform inspections. I would rather do that as well. I would take, that the tomb taught me
[01:15:51] about self awareness and being present within my own mind and developing this relationship with
[01:16:00] the conscious voice that's in my head, but also like this passive observer, this person who's
[01:16:06] kind of observing the narration of the voice in my head and sitting back and like measuring all
[01:16:12] these inputs. Because when you're standing still for 21 seconds at a time before you take 21 steps,
[01:16:19] repeating it times an hour for a long walk during the winter hours, times four to six walks a
[01:16:26] day. You have to get real good at being comfortable with yourself. Is there a face improvement in
[01:16:31] there? There is. So it's a face washing in DC 21 seconds, face down the mat 21 seconds, walk 21
[01:16:38] steps and repeat for the entire duration. And it's one hour. One hour and seven minutes with the walk
[01:16:45] in the garage change. How often would you be in total autopilot where you'd get done and be like,
[01:16:50] well, that was constantly. You know, that's referred to as the flow state. You're completely
[01:17:00] in a flow state. Because when I like about, you were talking about time. Time has always been
[01:17:06] important metric. In fact, we should probably get a more closely because that relationship with
[01:17:12] time, I think sets and establishes these gates and disciplines for your whole life,
[01:17:17] for the structure of your life, right? When I was a team guard, one thing that you had to
[01:17:22] train to do is count 21 seconds exactly and then turn into face for 21 seconds and get this
[01:17:28] rhythm and cadence down. But when you got into that flow state, it was unconscious. So now I'm just
[01:17:35] on autopilot and I'm in a meditative state. There's times that I came off the mat after an hour walk
[01:17:42] and feeling like the best I've ever felt, like super calm, super relaxed, super focused and like I
[01:17:49] was doing meditation in my own headspace. That translated throughout all of the uncomfortable,
[01:17:55] even experiences and gun fights and everything else I did in my life, created a structure in my
[01:18:01] head for being comfortable in my own head in physical stress in my environment.
[01:18:09] Sometimes when I do due to jutsu, I don't really know what happened for the last hour.
[01:18:13] Yeah, like I'm just like, what, how did you get that? I'm like, I don't remember getting anything.
[01:18:18] Yeah, and I remember early on in my in my seal career, like entering a room and shooting
[01:18:24] some targets and then and then all of a sudden be like, wait a second, my weapon, my weapon,
[01:18:27] I don't take it, I don't want to say it and not want to draw any attention to myself because I don't
[01:18:31] want to see that I don't want my weapon, weapon is unsafe. Yeah, I did it without and then
[01:18:34] you know, did it absolutely without thinking about it. That was pretty early, you know, and eventually
[01:18:38] you're just like doing this like a freaking robot, that's just execute. Yeah, that high level,
[01:18:43] I mean it's theta and alpha and these these wavelengths of like this neurological consciousness
[01:18:50] when you're in that alpha state and you're taking that that information similar to like,
[01:18:54] when you're in a shower or on a drive and all these thoughts come to you, this creativity
[01:18:58] comes to you. Those things happen in that flow state because you're streaming information and
[01:19:04] that's when you're most I think when you're at your best, right? It's when you're falling
[01:19:09] in CQB and everything comes together and you're like, what just happened? Like we were just
[01:19:14] objective secure in 17 seconds. How did that happen? I barely remember anything but I was so
[01:19:19] conscious because you run that alpha state of flow. It's an amazing state to be and
[01:19:24] and I think very rare for people to find these days with the distractions they have.
[01:19:31] You wrap up the QCourse. The last thing you do is rob and say to work and with, you know,
[01:19:35] role playing in-ditch and then you said you're almost immediately in Afghanistan.
[01:19:41] Right out the gate deployed with thirds, special forces could put a mountain team and then
[01:19:47] do nine months in Afghanistan or a mot fire base just right off the gate, right off the gate,
[01:19:52] during operation redwing. My company was involved in redwings.
[01:19:57] When I got to a team, it was the traditional green parade mission. We're going to put you in a
[01:20:02] mot fire base on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan as an 18-brobbo at 150 Afghan soldiers that
[01:20:09] weren't even soldiers. This is before Afghan National Army was even stood up and solidified,
[01:20:15] especially in our region of a nervous-stand province. And we trained assisted in advise these guys
[01:20:23] made them Afghan special forces guys and started conducting operations in a nervous-stand.
[01:20:29] What kind of operations were you conducting? Movement to contact. We did SR,
[01:20:34] Special Reconnaissance. We did DA a lot of training and a lot of getting attacked. I mean,
[01:20:44] we got attacked every other day in the remote location that we're in. We're the furthest
[01:20:51] northern fire base beyond J-bad, beyond Assadabad, in a fire base called Narei,
[01:20:57] right on the border, surrounded by the Hindu Kush. I mean, we were at the bottom of that bowl.
[01:21:04] So rockets and directed tax almost every other day. And so we did a lot of
[01:21:10] reactive contact, immediate action drills. And a lot of patrols. I mean, we drove up and down
[01:21:16] one MSR. I went down went to Paira-Calt and eventually ended up in Shetraw, Pakistan,
[01:21:22] and conducted a whole bunch of air ops and ground ops in that area.
[01:21:29] Was this like a traditional ODI team of 10 or 12 guys? 12 guys with a small contingent of
[01:21:37] civil affairs for a period of time, one combat controller, and a fire base, two hours from air and
[01:21:44] J-bad. So as remote as you can get, I mean, we were self-sustained. I learned a lot, even fast
[01:21:51] fording it with how I teach survival and sustaining oneself. And what we call just homestead as we teach it
[01:21:59] about how you have to take care of yourself because you don't have the opportunity.
[01:22:03] And those remote circumstances did a pen on any kind of assets. I mean, a snowstorm in that area
[01:22:08] would shut us down for a week at a time where we get no air support. No air support, no cast,
[01:22:14] no resupply, no meta-vac platforms. So we were solely dependent on the men and their skill sets
[01:22:22] that they have based on their experiences. That's freaking sketchy. It was the Wild West.
[01:22:30] The greatest time I had in SF to be honest. We didn't have a flagpole. We had
[01:22:35] Cyple-5 W's for a con-up submissions. It was a good time. And did you realize that while you were doing it?
[01:22:44] I did. I had the introspect. I mean, when I remember when I showed up and we landed at $10,000
[01:22:50] plus feet of elevation. And I was pissed in mellow yellow. I mean, I was like, do this is insane.
[01:22:56] And I remember standing in the middle of my fire base. We were long, comb-n-r river.
[01:23:00] Very small base. I mean, I could throw a football and hit every gate. I've ever
[01:23:06] been looking around going, well, this is my home for almost a year. Get comfortable with this,
[01:23:10] because this is how it's going to be. And immediately, transforming and using those cultural
[01:23:16] tactics and building relationships, but getting comfortable with time. Because I didn't know
[01:23:22] when we were going to get out. I didn't know if we were going to survive. We've lost a lot of
[01:23:26] guys. That rotation, operation, redwing, and a happen. So there's a whole bunch of circumstances
[01:23:31] that happen during that trip where I'm like, do this might be it? I mean, this is pretty hot,
[01:23:35] circumstance. Are you going to get out of this? Stop thinking about that. It's like the character
[01:23:40] in Banner Brothers, the officer who said, you know, who's basically walking dead, just accept
[01:23:45] the fact that you're going to be killed. I had those kind of moments going. This is it, man. We're
[01:23:50] focused on the mission. And it changed a lot of how I, what I assumed at war in practice and how
[01:23:57] it executed in real life. A lot of it was steering concepts and didn't necessarily translate.
[01:24:03] What was the delta between the two? The biggest thing was my relationship in the ODA was teaching
[01:24:11] tactics and creating a base defense plan. And so the doctrine told me to do specific things that
[01:24:17] didn't work in our environment. So you had a base defense plan for example, where I would exercise
[01:24:22] my guys and say, hey, I want you to hit the walls, hit the roof, be prepared for that directed tack.
[01:24:27] Well, that's the dumbest tactic when you're receiving one of seven millimeter rockets that
[01:24:31] have a kill radius of a hundred yards. And so you put dudes on the roof, which I did myself on the
[01:24:36] first directed tack, got on the roof with a 240 machine gun. And I'm like, do what am I? And I'm
[01:24:42] getting, and we's a 107 screamed over me, my 18 Charlie, my engineer, and impact it a fuel
[01:24:48] blivit behind us and exploded. And I'm like, what am I doing? And also in practice, you could
[01:24:56] immediate action to death, what it's like to react to contact with small arms. But how do you react
[01:25:02] to contact when it's a 107 millimeter rocket? When it's an 81 millimeter motor, all of the things
[01:25:08] that you prepare for change rapidly, when that kind of ordinance and munitions and firepower
[01:25:15] come to bear completely changes everything. So I'm like, oh, this isn't like run it through
[01:25:20] wood line and Fort Bragg North Carolina. This is a little bit different. And so that change my
[01:25:25] perspective on a doctrinal conventional answer and solution versus being creative and coming
[01:25:31] up with new ways and tactics as you evolve at the speed of war. Did you guys have any counter
[01:25:39] battery or anything like that? None. I had, did you have mortars? I had 120 millimeter mortars.
[01:25:45] I mean, nightly that I would go out and we'd be dropping on point of origin sites on
[01:25:49] poo sites. But that's all we had. The biggest weapon systems we had were munitions and
[01:25:56] cashiers that we found and cashers that we found where we took them and turned them around on
[01:26:02] bad guys. We put a Mark 21, 107 millimeter pod. We get one rocket from the bad guy. The
[01:26:07] sit rep would read, you know, ODA366 response with 57, 107 millimeter rockets. 106 millimeter
[01:26:14] recorulus rifles. We had mounted the ATVs. We had RPGs that we carried with us in backpacks
[01:26:20] and we were using Chinese made 120s to respond and react to contact. So it was truly a, I think,
[01:26:29] significant green beret fire base mission. You ever seen the movie heat before? Yeah,
[01:26:38] yeah. This makes me think about this is the second time I thought about it in recent times, but
[01:26:43] you know, like the cop is telling, the cop is saying, hey, you can make mistakes. Or no,
[01:26:53] I can make mistakes. Doesn't matter if I catch you or not. Like I'm going to go home at night.
[01:26:56] Yeah. You make one mistake and it's game over. Yeah. And that's what I think of, you know,
[01:27:01] the enemy in that situation, they don't have to take very big risks at all. They can
[01:27:06] lob shit at you from wherever and they just have to get lucky one time. That's it to get a guy.
[01:27:11] Yeah. And you've got to be vigilant all the time and you've got to keep your guard up all the time.
[01:27:18] And even if you keep your guard up all the time, you're still just exposed just by the nature
[01:27:21] of the fact that you're in a valley surrounded by indirect fire or direct fire in terms of rockets.
[01:27:25] Yeah. Yeah. Our strategy in that fire base was a test bed for creativity.
[01:27:34] Um, we built a mosque like I physically built a mosque with my hands. My ODA brick by brick helped
[01:27:41] build a mosque. Why? Because we wanted to build rapport with having a place of
[01:27:49] worship inside of our fire base for Afghans, but it also deterred indirect fire. Because no
[01:27:54] terrorists weren't be responsible for dropping a mosque in the middle of an American fire base.
[01:27:58] Like we had to think outside the box. And we truly were set up almost for failure in that circumstance.
[01:28:06] But every fire base had a hold its territory. Before VSO, we're village stabilization operations
[01:28:14] where you're setting up in the actual village, the idea of fire bases derived from obviously
[01:28:19] from Vietnam era, from John Shreck and Mire air of, hey, let's go out, set out these bases
[01:28:24] and establish a presence. And so we were present and the bad guys knew about it. And it was a
[01:28:30] sharp learning curve steep learning curve, instead of least. Where you get the food from?
[01:28:35] Typically, initially we were flying in and until we started getting creative, we built a
[01:28:42] breadhouse where we were making foot bread, Afghan foot bread in the middle of our fire base.
[01:28:47] Then we started procuring goats and sheep and then slaughtering them and then eating them and
[01:28:52] then rice and we were getting supplies from Pakistan because it was around across the border
[01:28:58] and bringing it in to make actually good mills versus the Murmai child that we're getting. That was
[01:29:04] garbage too. It was disgusting. Did you, did you take any casualties from all those attacks?
[01:29:11] Yeah, I mean we had, we had wounded in actual, I killed an action or a company. We, during the mid range,
[01:29:18] we just had the anniversary of Operation Red Wings, which was the 28th of June.
[01:29:27] We got hit up for that mission task with that. Can't advance, which was in Bagram,
[01:29:33] kind of assembled the quick reaction force that eventually went out and lost one of the birds
[01:29:38] on the MH-47 that were shot down. So we did QRF for that. Did some big operations and
[01:29:46] what coat you've all in your barricade and took casualties. We lost the MH-47 during that trip.
[01:29:53] Pretty expensive bird. It was overall a good trip. Our fire bases were successful and
[01:29:59] disrupting the enemy, but we just started over, man. The detriment to warfare is this vicious cycle.
[01:30:08] And when you take a playbook and you plan the playbook, but you don't put in the same
[01:30:13] continuity pieces to establish a long-term relationship, you just start the vicious cycle over again.
[01:30:19] Every detachment commander, every team sergeant, once their mark in history on that battleground,
[01:30:28] and it doesn't do well long-term in warfare, which is obviously where the point we're at today.
[01:30:34] I mean pulling on an abafghanistan. Would you do during redway? Were you on the recovery
[01:30:40] of the war? So two of my companies in a side of ad in J. Bad, south of us got tasked to actually do
[01:30:48] the rescue of Marcus Attro. So, good buddy of my Kent was the ground force commander for that.
[01:30:54] Two ODAs and the arrangers went in with some intermittent special operations guys.
[01:31:00] We got told because of our proximity to the actual site crash site to hold fast, they sent
[01:31:06] schnooks to us to be the QRF for the other group and then the rest of our company, all the other
[01:31:11] ODAs did the battery recovery with batayan. So there was a the whole company was involved and
[01:31:17] some way, but I suddenly airfilled through the entire operation, not doing much.
[01:31:27] So your leadership lessons on that deployment were, you know, you got to think, you got, you
[01:31:34] can't follow the doctrine all the time. Yeah. Look, green braids are known to be unconventional
[01:31:42] in a regular war for experts and thinking outside the box, the idea of, hey, you're not still
[01:31:48] when you're acquiring. These creative tasks to bear that benefit you on the ground is what I
[01:31:56] learned about. I actually learned that, you know, being in a remote firebase and Afghanistan
[01:32:01] with minimal to no resources at all, you had to come up with solutions. So I learned about
[01:32:09] establishing problem sets, coming up with creative solutions and the path to execution for those,
[01:32:15] which is a formula that I used in, you know, a combat rotation slater.
[01:32:22] And you're running a company of 150 Afghans. Yep. Yeah, I ran. So I was the, when I went, I was the
[01:32:31] only bravo, typically you run a junior in a senior. I would have been the junior because I was a young
[01:32:35] staff sergeant. My senior had surgery so he couldn't show up until later on in the deployment.
[01:32:41] My team started came to me like on the first day and he said, hey, there's a formation outside
[01:32:45] with your guys. I'm like my guys. Like, yeah, you got 150 Afghans out there. You're the commander.
[01:32:50] And I'm like, what? I'm like, Roger that. I go outside. I'm like, guys, let's, let's, let's,
[01:32:56] let me give you an in-brief. Let's, we're going to do assessments that give them the plan.
[01:32:59] And I have to do it for these dudes. These dudes are looking at me like a machiled and I was, I mean,
[01:33:04] it was a 25-year-old child. So they challenged me immediately. One of the guys says to me,
[01:33:12] Mike, they want to know if you're a good shooter. And I said, well, what does that assessment look like?
[01:33:19] You know, well, what they like to do, I'm like, okay, so this has been done before. What they like to
[01:33:24] do is take a piece of bubble gum wrapper and they delaminate it and they put a 1-inch square at 25 yards
[01:33:30] on the target and they said, whoever gets closer, whoever's closer wins, but then you earn
[01:33:35] our respect. I'm like, did you guys watch a movie man? Is this like, is this the thing? Because I don't,
[01:33:39] I don't remember seeing this anywhere. And like, it's, it's part of their traditional, like,
[01:33:43] okay, cool. So we get in the prone and I saw the Zords rifle, not it's rifle, AK 47. So,
[01:33:50] but no red dot, our iron sights and I don't even know the point of aim or impact on this gun. It's
[01:33:55] no dope on it. Oh, it's a random AK. So I said, so I say to the guy, I said, this is the same weapon that
[01:34:02] you shoot at the circus at the little red star. Exactly. Notching the star out of the counter fair.
[01:34:09] So he sits down and he's a well-respected nurse standing and these guys look like me. I mean,
[01:34:14] I look like I belong in that tribe and they're all Chinese influence. And so they all
[01:34:20] look up the Asian eyes. And so, rapport initially right off the bat is like accepted,
[01:34:25] but I have to prove myself. So this guy gets down the prone and he takes a shot. And we go up
[01:34:30] and inspect it and he's like an inch off of the pasty. So I'm thinking of my head, he's holding it
[01:34:36] and he's shooting it, but he's a little bit high. And that 25 yards flashed bang. That much
[01:34:41] change in muzzle velocity at 25 yards. So I'm thinking, let me just aim at the base of this thing.
[01:34:46] So I'll put my I'll probably pop this one inch pasty and I break a shot and it goes through
[01:34:52] the piece and try to contain my excitement because I'm like, yeah, I don't want to be like, yeah,
[01:34:59] what's up? But I knew it was part of this whole story in this journey. So I go up there and they
[01:35:05] they bust out and they're like, yeah, oh my god, they're so excited. And from that moment,
[01:35:10] it's like, I was their commander. And we have this relationship where I train them every single day.
[01:35:15] I broke bread with them every single day. And it was a beautiful thing, man. I felt like I had a company
[01:35:20] worth of valuable human beings who had laid down their life. And when I found out later, and this
[01:35:26] is an in hindsight looking back and talking to different guys, when I left, I had those afghan commandos.
[01:35:32] I handed them over to another ODA. When third group came back in, they rotated in and there was a
[01:35:37] guy by the name of Rob, Rob, Rob something. I can't remember his name. It's a horrible
[01:35:46] camera. And he rotated in with him as the 18 Bravo. So when he gets in that position,
[01:35:53] he starts grooming these guys and they're telling stories of that circumstance. So as this
[01:36:00] evolves later in the war, I find out that one of the guys that we had from third group that was
[01:36:06] killed postusiously in a gunfight, running uphill with a machine gun. Gets killed,
[01:36:13] earns the metal of honor and dies fighting side by side with these same guys. In fact, some of
[01:36:20] those guys that I trained were killed in that action, where a third group of guys won the metal
[01:36:27] earned the metal of honor, sacrifices life. But those afghans died on that same hilltop,
[01:36:32] running uphill against an enemy, machine gun, nested position. And I'm like, dude, I mean,
[01:36:39] you look for all the light and darkness and I'm like, man, that means the world to me,
[01:36:45] that maybe I had an impact on these men that stood side by side and fought uphill. And that
[01:36:52] truly meant a lot. And so those guys, you earn their respect, you operate with them. But when I
[01:36:58] left him, it was the, I felt like they into the world. And you know, you talk to guys like John
[01:37:02] Strike or Meyer, that's a common thing. It's something that we're not very good at. In fact, we're
[01:37:07] pretty horrible at. And now, of course, you must be kind of sick. You're stomach seeing that we're
[01:37:12] pulling out. And those guys will either be rounded up and killed or they'll join the Taliban
[01:37:20] because that's what they got to do to stay alive. More likely, all the intel has been leaked already.
[01:37:26] They already know who they are and they have their target deck built. And right now, I mean, if you
[01:37:31] look at all the different places, especially the remote places of Afghanistan, which is very
[01:37:35] tribal, very geographically regionally, there are already taken over. I mean, they'll have the
[01:37:41] estimates from the experts is in the next six months, a boggroom and can are, we'll fall to the
[01:37:47] Taliban. If not sooner, because there was a formal agreement, a diplomatic agreement, that means
[01:37:53] they're supposed to take over in some capacity anyway. But what that means to the rest of the
[01:37:58] men that we fought off all over the country, all these guys will be rolled up and more likely
[01:38:02] executed, which is a damn shame. Yes, here in some reports that the Taliban would go to, you know,
[01:38:11] some of these villages or whatever, and send a note into the police chief and say, hey, man,
[01:38:17] yeah, it's over. You can get on board or we're going to kill you and kill your family. And
[01:38:21] the police chief or whatever local Afghan leaders, like Roger that, you know, I'm on board.
[01:38:27] And that's that. Yeah, those guys, just like an Iraq, just like I've experienced in Yemen,
[01:38:34] in Pakistan, in Africa, it's a vicious cycle that doesn't stop and we don't learn those lessons.
[01:38:44] But I don't know the answer. I don't know the solution. I mean, make it in citizens and bring
[01:38:48] them out, taking the fighting force that's the most capable human beings there and doing that.
[01:38:52] I don't know what the answer is, but it's a horrible thing that I know is transpire,
[01:38:56] likely right now. So you get done with that deployment?
[01:39:03] Yeah, I've get done with Afghanistan immediately come back and go to a Sephardic, which is our
[01:39:09] version of advanced CQB, HOSIS rescue, to be alive with a DA company, you know, the, when I work with the
[01:39:16] CQB, the CILS and OSIXO7, all the, the latter rotations, it was mostly with a company called
[01:39:23] the Commander in Extremist Force, which has now been renamed the Crisis Response Force, which has
[01:39:28] been reclaimed deep underground unit for tunnels and stuff. So get part of that unit, which our
[01:39:37] focus is DA, SR, HR, and get through Sephardic, no problems, and get immediately reassigned to the
[01:39:46] Commander's in Extremist Force, which is hopping on a plane the next month to go down a range.
[01:39:52] So how long are you home for? Four months, home for four months.
[01:39:57] How long is that deployment to Afghanistan? Nine months total. Yeah. So nine months, get back,
[01:40:02] do Sephardic for two months, and then get about a month and a half before we burn out for Iraq
[01:40:09] for Baghdad. Have you gotten married or anything at this point? Yeah, I actually got about that.
[01:40:14] I actually got married right before this rotation, and in a courthouse, I grabbed my
[01:40:20] past away at that same time period, didn't get a lot of time to have any kind of anything
[01:40:26] with the family, and then we were turning it in burden for Iraq.
[01:40:29] Four months home, and now what's this deployment? So this is now your first deployment to Iraq.
[01:40:36] First of all, I'm going down a range in CT is the, and this is O6. O6.
[01:40:44] Yeah. And so you ended up working in Baghdad. In Baghdad, Baghdad,
[01:40:50] it's our national airport. We were at camp, not camp, and it's area four. So we staged the area
[01:40:57] four, and a couple of mission sets, working with Iraq, and counterterrorism forces, working with
[01:41:03] task force, as a, you don't matter a force, and then working with the ERU, which is the emergency
[01:41:09] response unit, the equivalent of the FBI HRT that prosecutes targets in Iraq.
[01:41:14] Iraq, that's an Iraqi unit. Iraq just for everyone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:41:18] So the ICTF is an Iraqi unit there in Iraqi unit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:41:24] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Almost acted like the Mike force until, you know, the
[01:41:33] Mike force strike unit until we get there, and we start doing joint operations with napsoff
[01:41:39] and then the SIF. So it's, it's like a couple guys from my SIF company, which was B23, the third
[01:41:45] group SIF, working hand in hand with six or seven guys from a silver tomb. And we would go out
[01:41:52] and at the time, we weren't, they weren't doing operations with Americans because a company,
[01:41:58] a contract with company was training them, but they weren't, advising them, but they weren't doing
[01:42:02] counterterrorism operations. So we actually took over and started doing the first counterterrorism
[01:42:07] operations with them side by side using our assets to bear, but doing the true CT for an internal
[01:42:15] defense mission. So you're rolling out a hidden targets? Hidden targets. Every night.
[01:42:19] It's basically what this is. Yeah. Smashed in targets every night. I mean, our, our PDSS, our pre-department
[01:42:24] deployment site survey, we got it again, fight and kill dudes and our PDSS. So we were like,
[01:42:29] it's going to be a hot year. And that was a year you were there. Yeah. Yeah. I was over and
[01:42:33] a body. You guys were down and back then. You were working alongside some of the guys I was with.
[01:42:37] Well, that I knew over there. Just basically nightly ops. Reverse cycle nightly ops. We had a
[01:42:47] cycle of, you know, red amber green, your train dudes. Even if you're training dudes, you're probably
[01:42:52] gunning on trucks or acting as a machine gunner on half, on helicopter assaults, but every single
[01:43:00] night we were prosecuted targets. Sometimes two, three targets, the night, depending on what was going on.
[01:43:04] So we had a target deck. Everybody else in task force had a target deck. And at the time,
[01:43:09] which was in transition for the big surge, we were prosecuting at the time, she-a-based targets.
[01:43:19] And so, Mooktaal, Saadr, and his network of shitheads, we were going after every night.
[01:43:27] Were you working mostly in the round Baghdad or all over their country?
[01:43:30] Pretty much all over the country. I mean, we have with Navy assets, flying us out the 60s.
[01:43:35] We were using Pavelo or the 53. Or you use some task force 160. So little birds, 60s,
[01:43:43] depending on what was going on. It was all over, all over. And what was your specific job on this
[01:43:49] deployment? So I was an assaulter. I mean, in the SIF, I was an assaulter, I was a breacher.
[01:43:54] I actually was deployed with, at the time, Jeremy Wise. Jeremy Wise was a young
[01:44:00] East Coast-based silt team member who wanted up getting killed with the CIA as a global response
[01:44:06] staff officer. He possibly was awarded the CIA star. And we were both breaches together.
[01:44:15] So every night we did breaches. We did unilateral pieces of our up. So a couple of Americans,
[01:44:22] like me and another SIF guy, and like three or five seals would go out and do our piece. We'd hit
[01:44:27] one building and then the Iraqis we were with with with another building. So get a lateral
[01:44:32] assaulter is basically what we were. It's radically different deployment than what you did in Afghanistan.
[01:44:37] I mean, not even the same freaking ballpark in saying completely different. I try to use some of the,
[01:44:43] you know, the similarities where we were training them in the back end. But these guys,
[01:44:47] if you saw them operating when they're kid, you would think they're Americans. Like competent
[01:44:52] assaulters, snipers, Americans. Yeah, and they had all American gear and weapons because I was telling
[01:44:58] you I went over on PDSS and because we were going to go, I actually, if that would happen,
[01:45:02] I would have been collocated with you and we would have been running the same out. We would already
[01:45:05] know each other. We'd be bros. Yeah, we'd run together. Yeah, we'd have rolled out. But we ended up
[01:45:10] not going to re-end it going to Ramadhi and said, but yeah, the, the, the ICTF and the EREU had, like,
[01:45:17] American issued weapons. They had night vision had everything, everything, everything. Yeah,
[01:45:21] they had everything. And they were well trained, well trained. They had to be the best trained,
[01:45:26] and most reliable Iraqi soldiers by a landslide. Yeah, the combination of the Iraqi counterterrorism
[01:45:32] force, which we pulled out a, I rack and adjordan and isolate and trained. And the EREU that
[01:45:38] turned into the emergency response battalion, were the highest paid trained experienced units that
[01:45:47] eventually took ISIS. These same guys, I lost probably half my fighting force that I worked
[01:45:52] with over the years against the fight against ISIS in 2014 when we pulled our guys out and
[01:45:58] those dudes went to war. I mean, they went to Missouri, they went to Baghdad, they went to Kurdistan,
[01:46:03] they were fighting in their bill. They were probably with close air support, meaning the JTAC
[01:46:10] peace with the sole reasons that ISIS doesn't exist in Iraq today. So it's, it's a, it was a long
[01:46:16] road ahead of them. We were just in the beginning stages of it. What did you prefer for the deployment?
[01:46:22] What did you like doing better? Man, that's a tough question. So different, so different, right?
[01:46:28] But in the things that I enjoyed like overlanding across Afghanistan and the wild west,
[01:46:35] with not a lot of oversight and just wing in it and learning a lot of lessons in that
[01:46:41] versus that deliberate like land on the X, fast-repaunt off of the building and kill bad guys.
[01:46:47] I enjoy them both. I mean, if I could have, if I could overland to an objective and fast-repaunt
[01:46:52] off of it, that whole combination, it'd be perfect. Man, I love both of them.
[01:46:58] And then how long was this deployment to Baghdad six months? Yeah, so we were doing six month rotations.
[01:47:03] Did you, did you guys take any casualties on that deployment? We did. We took every
[01:47:08] deployment that we wanted to take and we wanted to lose an esteemed guy. So we were working with
[01:47:13] joint task force, which included tier one units and the Rangers and us and the Navy. You guys were
[01:47:20] taking casualties. There was EFTs that were affecting guys, gun fights. We took a casualty.
[01:47:26] One of my guys and my troop was killed. That rotation, tongue-no-in was killed. And then
[01:47:32] time apart, purple hard, students get in gun fights. It was an active year.
[01:47:40] Was, was tongue the first guy that you lost that was in your actual element?
[01:47:46] Yeah, and that was on my team and my troop first, first did.
[01:47:52] Didn't know him great. I mean, I knew him. I was a new guy there, but one of the most respected
[01:47:57] members of that unit. I mean, he was the guy on the PDSS with his long gun who wound it up killing
[01:48:02] like three bad dudes on a PDSS. I mean, who goes TTY and kills a few dudes comes back after,
[01:48:09] getting in town like, you got some intel on target. He was that kind of guy.
[01:48:14] Vietnamese descent too. So me and him were the only Asians in that group. He took, he took,
[01:48:21] he took his job serious and when he saw me come into the company, he took me on earth's wing
[01:48:28] and he tried to take care of me. He experienced a soldier, belonged to C11, which is the first group's
[01:48:33] sift and did a whole bunch of operations and the Philippines all over Southeast Asia.
[01:48:38] And just a highly respected dude. I mean, just a great guy. And when, how deep into the
[01:48:43] point was that? Man, right, I'll pick eight. I mean, it was only a couple months in. We still had
[01:48:49] four months of that rotation. And then at the end of our rotation was the surge. So we got super
[01:48:55] hot, super active. Probably some of the closest experiences to death I had in that, and that
[01:49:01] rotation for me personally. From gun fights, from IEDs, now gun fights. I mean, I was on a
[01:49:08] roof top in Saudar City once in a sniper over watch position for a horse's rescue.
[01:49:13] Got pinned down to the roof. I had a big army sniper team that was with me.
[01:49:18] That, that one and a half hour gun fight, small arms, RPGs, water rounds, all in the same
[01:49:27] gun fight, all on our position. Under the frigate, I was like, you know, laying on the roof, trying
[01:49:33] to keep my head flat and staying in the fight. Because we had a retreat option. We couldn't
[01:49:37] went down into the building into the third story that we were on. And I looked over in my buddy Chris,
[01:49:42] because there's only two of us with a big army sniper unit was laying underneath the satellite
[01:49:49] dish. And we're, the three stories high. So we're above most of the city, but there's still
[01:49:55] second and third story buildings inside Saudar City. And he's getting the satellite dish
[01:50:00] disintegrated over his ass a couple feet over his butt. And I'm like, oh, these guys are close.
[01:50:06] They have his dad, they have them us down in. And then I looked up in the sky,
[01:50:10] because I something caught my attention, I looked up and there was RPGs air bursting above us.
[01:50:15] And I'm like, this is not good. So we, we basically started way laying in bad guys that were
[01:50:22] squirting into the objective, like trying to infill on containment. And that were breaking contact
[01:50:27] out of the objective. And all black, body militia dudes, black pajama kind of guys. And a lot of
[01:50:34] it was command and control because we had cast, I had control, I had comms with a closer support F-16
[01:50:42] that was above us. And we were trying to relay and report all the information, but we were having comms
[01:50:48] problems. So what low that fight, you know, in the long story of it, what low that fight was in F-16
[01:50:56] because I marked a V-S-17 panel in the middle of that roof came out of its rotation, its orbit,
[01:51:05] and over 500 feet above our building did a pass and pop flaters. I thought he was going to do a
[01:51:11] gun running kill us all because we lost comms. So I popped that V-S-17 and I looked up and he
[01:51:16] started banging in and I'm like yelled at my combo guy and I'm like, do we have any comms? And he
[01:51:21] came down and ran the perimeter road which I think was, he's called home base, we're at the base
[01:51:28] of a leg of Sauder City from home base to third base. He ran that entire road at 500 feet,
[01:51:34] turned his wings, you can almost see his face and pop flaters and it rolled the gun and
[01:51:39] fight enough for us to get out, break contact into Bradley's and break contact. We killed,
[01:51:45] I mean, total turned that up over 100 dudes and got a shut down for like a month on a side
[01:51:51] of city. I mean, tanks were destroying buildings five feet in front of them because they were,
[01:51:58] I mean, they were just getting smashed with RPGs and everything else. Pretty pretty darn again,
[01:52:02] fight. And that was the end of year to point at a no-6? About mid-rotation, that was about mid-rotation.
[01:52:08] Good times. Then you come back, do another work up? Instant work up, getting ready for a new
[01:52:22] deployment and then we go down range. O7's different beast, the height of Alkaira. On the
[01:52:31] tailland of that rotation the surge begins, the Sunni strategy, they start the Suns of Iraq,
[01:52:36] they start empowering Sunni's. There's a war going on between the Sunni's and she is. And
[01:52:42] typically it's like, you know, the exotic city versus everybody else in the country. And now the
[01:52:48] Sunni's are getting supported by the US. So we're going to war with Iran back, she is. And we get
[01:52:56] into that rotation. And our task force does a couple things. They have a mission set where they go,
[01:53:03] hey, you guys are going to go and do bilateral operations, working with indigenous guys, like
[01:53:07] ICTF, like ERU, like we talked about. But there's another component our mission set where we work
[01:53:13] with J-Sock. I joined Task Force. So we were under joint task force conducting counterterrorism
[01:53:22] operations, hunting HVT's on a deck for J-Sock as part of one of their action arms, that
[01:53:30] whole entire rotation. And it was epic. It was one of my best rotations. If listen, so this is now
[01:53:37] 07, you're back over there. Oh seven Iraq. Yeah. In Baghdad again. Yeah, we're at Fernandez and
[01:53:42] SS Fernandez named after a unit guy was killed. And you're doing and you're doing one hit, you're
[01:53:49] working with the Indage one night. And then two nights later, you get a package from J-Sock and you're
[01:53:55] going out and hit that target. So we divided our troops. Oh, okay. So my troops just doing
[01:53:59] you to a lot of rocks. Who was killing the bad guys? Later on the X every night. Just kidding. Yeah,
[01:54:04] I was crank. Yeah. That was how big is your unit that you're working with? 20. So our
[01:54:11] troop is about 20 plus guys. And at the time, I'm a sniper now. So I moved over to the sniper
[01:54:16] section. So I'm a sniper team supporting to assault teams for hits every single night. So my
[01:54:24] job specifically was containment. So I was setting a establishing containment. A lot of building
[01:54:28] climbing that rotation. A lot of Overwatch killing squirters running out of buildings,
[01:54:35] killing bad guys trying to get to the fight. And it was like the gloves are off. I mean,
[01:54:41] the strategy that we got passed down and rules of engagement were killed them all. And that's
[01:54:47] what that's what we were doing. And so it was an epic rotation. We had a lot of HVT's, a lot of foreign
[01:54:52] fighters, a lot of gun fights, a lot of casualties on our side. And a lot of dead bad guys.
[01:55:03] Were you guys mostly taking vehicles or are you doing helicopters all the time? Most of it was
[01:55:07] half was helicopter assaults with little birds and in the eight sixties. So all black hoax and little birds.
[01:55:13] Every, I think pretty much every night it was that. I don't remember too many ground assaults.
[01:55:17] A couple here and there in the strikers. If we had to go to Soder City, we took
[01:55:21] tanks that would lead the way into the Soder City, suck up all the EFPs. We called them Team Rock.
[01:55:29] They would get blown up for us even to the point. Yeah, even to the point where these guys would
[01:55:34] get blown up, they'd pull over to the side of the road and we just bypassed. They were just the
[01:55:37] bridge point. And they were the hammer we were going through and hitting our surgical targets.
[01:55:44] It was a great rotation man. We lost a guy. One of our team guys, Justin Monchky was killed,
[01:55:51] stepped on a pressure plate ID. We had about, uh, in my company, we had about 15 purple hearts.
[01:55:57] So a lot of dudes injured shot, blown up. Um, and a lot, we killed a lot of bad guys. I mean,
[01:56:03] it was a good trip for a killing bad guys. How are these, um, you're, what, what's your position
[01:56:08] and as far as leadership inside the company here? So I'm, uh, I'm a two IC. So I'm
[01:56:13] right behind my cell leader, um, as a new sniper. Um, so I do it my cell leader at the time Jason,
[01:56:20] uh, tells me to do. And most of my role is because I was pretty lean and a good climber
[01:56:28] me and a couple of the other guys were on the climbing team. And so if we had a containment set,
[01:56:32] we hit a building. We used ladders or even building climb traverse ladders, um, from building
[01:56:38] to building and set and tame it from a high position. We called high team to be able to contain the
[01:56:44] objective from top down while the assaulters hit a deliberate target set. So traditional
[01:56:50] countdown's 5432. Breach goes off at 2 and then we hit the target. And you're doing it in
[01:56:56] an op and night, basically. Sometimes the other, yeah, sometimes a couple more than that. Yeah,
[01:57:01] but we a lot of this, this time period was, um, taking advantage of SSC. There was an emphasis on
[01:57:08] sensitive site exploitation. Doing a lot of posts analysis on the objective, a lot of tactical
[01:57:13] interrogation to lend itself to taking advantage of the opportunity on a target and flexing to other
[01:57:21] targets to take down networks. So super aggressive, the combination of two two, uh, SAS Ranger
[01:57:28] Battalion, uh, Cag, us and, and Def, uh, five action arms under task 416. And this is Stanley
[01:57:35] McCrissel's big project, right, his, his, um, his big, uh, machine of war. What, what, what it was was
[01:57:44] one of the most significant, I think, most significant strategies in the war, especially a
[01:57:49] patrition of taking out bad guys. As you're, be talked about, um, you're, you're losing some guys now.
[01:57:58] How's, how's your, um, how are you guys handling that? So the reason I asked this question is
[01:58:06] because somebody's going to be listening to this in 10 years or 17 years or 23 years and we're
[01:58:11] going to be in a situation where there hasn't been any casualties in a long time and all the
[01:58:15] sudden someone's going out and doing what, doing what soldiers do and they're going to take casualties.
[01:58:21] And I know when I, when I took my first casualties and had lost my first guys, there was no one
[01:58:27] that was telling me like, hey, here's what you got to think about. Not just from a, look, we get the
[01:58:32] protocol of, hey, here's the, here's the book that we're going to follow. Here's the calls we got to make,
[01:58:37] but now you got a bunch of guys that just lost one of their best friends and what are you going to do
[01:58:41] about that? How did you guys go about it? Great question. Um, a lot of responses that are, um,
[01:58:52] doctrinal would have guys stand down have a moments if not days of mourning a process.
[01:59:03] Um, I remember when we lost tongue in O6 are immediate strategy at the tactical level. So
[01:59:12] you talking cell leaders and trip-smart majors said, listen, we're not waiting. We're hitting targets
[01:59:19] tonight and we got aggressive and we went out in in O6 and O7 we had a vindiction, um, vindication board.
[01:59:31] This vindication board was, uh, filled with team guys that we lost and there was dozens of
[01:59:37] on one side and when you killed a bad guy because you took that call sign patch and then, you know,
[01:59:43] if you were as Tony Yoset, who was a third group team sergeant, I was killed, you would just carry TY on your
[01:59:49] left shoulder under your call sign patch and if you killed a bad guy and you were successful on
[01:59:55] your mission, you'd come back and you put it on the vindicated side and we had all the pictures of
[02:00:01] the guys that were killed on that and every night we'd fill that board and cycle them back and forth
[02:00:06] because, um, we understood that getting killed was a part of the job, comparatively and you know this
[02:00:16] you're very skilled in the history of warfare including the Vietnam War where thousands, 60 plus
[02:00:23] thousand Americans were killed, sometimes hundreds in certain battles were killed, entire Mac
[02:00:28] V. Sog teams taken off the planet, they accepted that risk. So when we lost guys in our community,
[02:00:35] there was no morning, there wasn't time to mourn, we get back on helicopters, I remember
[02:00:40] something that really stands out to me from the O7 trip, we lost two to S.A.S. guys, they were killed
[02:00:46] on target in order to have three of them that were killed. The task force commander had us come
[02:00:51] outside and the two to S.A.S. commander briefed five different task units and he spoke to warfare
[02:01:00] and he spoke to the importance of understanding the fight we're in, how this works and getting back
[02:01:07] in the fight. It was of 10 minutes spill and we're all sitting there in kit with guns in our specific
[02:01:13] units and at the end of the speech he gives a hand in arm signal and all the little birds and all
[02:01:19] this 60 spin up and we load five different task forces up in little birds and MH60s and fly away
[02:01:26] and smash bad guys. That whole experience was what the task force was, depending on what unit you
[02:01:33] were, you might have that experience but if you weren't task force that was the experience of
[02:01:39] night. We accept that risk, we lost guys and then we got back in the fight because we had no time
[02:01:43] to mourn. It wasn't a time for mourning. That's um, same strategy I had, you know, got to get your
[02:01:52] ship back on, get your gear back on, and go back out and do what you're supposed to do and do
[02:01:58] what your boys would want you to do exactly. Yeah. Any good leadership lessons or any
[02:02:07] leadership lessons from that deployment that stand out? The biggest one is I'll say his name
[02:02:12] not because he's retired. He was the commander that we worked under as name was Tom D. Tumaso.
[02:02:19] It was aatoon leader blackhawk down as a young ranger at the time was a cag commander and he was
[02:02:26] our commander. When we got to that country we had gotten used to the way that we did business,
[02:02:33] breaching blowing every door, shooting back guys in the face and he briefed us and he said,
[02:02:38] man we're going to start this new tactic this year and it's called callouts and we laughed. We joked.
[02:02:44] It was comical to us. We even wrote drew cartoons about how comical this whole tactic was.
[02:02:53] So let me get this straight. You want us to go to a building, land little birds offset,
[02:02:57] serapticiously approach and then knock essentially knock and call them out.
[02:03:03] Yes, that's what we want you to do. So the whole time we're like this is ridiculous. This is insane.
[02:03:07] Until we hit a foreign safe house that had Libyan foreign fighters and in the war in Iraq,
[02:03:15] positions two and four out of the top four guys killed on the battlefield that were killing Americans.
[02:03:21] Formatable foes were from Libya, two and four. Number one was Saudi Arabia. Number two was Libya.
[02:03:29] Out of these foreign fighters, they were training the Green Mountains of Libya.
[02:03:34] They had gear that was comparable to ours. A solo boots,
[02:03:39] Santo watches, chess rigs, suicide vest, proper guns with red dot optics and all the tactics
[02:03:48] to bear. We hit a foreign safe house offset on infill, which was about a 4k, 2 to 4k offset,
[02:03:57] which is offsetting away from the objective so you don't get compromised.
[02:04:00] We get compromised by a early warning position. Our little bird attack helicopter kills six dudes
[02:04:07] run off the bat on infill. Birds get straight at the bird. I'm in the 60. I'm in feet hanging off
[02:04:12] the 60 takes incoming rounds in between us and the chalk in front of us. We land, we make movement.
[02:04:21] We think there's a couple of foreign fighters. There's 13 and they're also decided bested out.
[02:04:26] Long story short, I have a dog, save my life, a cag dog, but a new move.
[02:04:33] But a suicide bomber 15 meters in front of me.
[02:04:36] Sacrifice his life for mine. We get into the house, we kill everybody.
[02:04:42] We establish SSE after objective secure and realize they have pk, machine guns,
[02:04:49] barricaded and sandbag positions. A threshold deep away from the reach point.
[02:04:55] If we'd have reached that like every target set we'd reach before prior we would all die.
[02:04:59] We would have got the first assault element would have been zipped up. They would have broke contact out of back
[02:05:04] and we'd been fighting for allies. We were fighting for allies in containment. We had offset containment called the mount
[02:05:09] and we were in a hand-to-hand range.
[02:05:13] So you did that up doing containment and doing a callout on them? We did. We did exactly what he trained us to do.
[02:05:19] And even in that, I mean I threw six hand grenades on the other side of a berm
[02:05:25] and direct engagement in contact with enemy. I mean the hand grenades I was throwing with my teammate
[02:05:31] were landing in bad guys laps on the other side of the berm. These dudes were ready to get it on.
[02:05:36] We decimated the target with 105s from a spectrogunship. We recovered Vinnie's body.
[02:05:41] And then we dropped a J-DAM on an ex-film and daylight. We got back Vinnie was covered in American flag.
[02:05:51] The whole task was there to salute us. We got blood on our shoes. Some dudes are injured and we're like
[02:06:01] this makes sense. I realized from that experience,
[02:06:07] don't be in a rush to die. So many guys want to get on the ex and they want to do this thing called
[02:06:14] kicking indoors and shoot back as in the face. But they don't understand the tactics and techniques
[02:06:20] procedures evolve every single day at the speed of war. And it was the realization where I had
[02:06:27] the coolest guy because he's the coolest commander of the coolest unit telling us something that
[02:06:32] it seemed cool and then that realization coming home and going down. Okay, now we got a change tactics.
[02:06:38] We got to think outside the box. We can't get, we can't conform to convention and to routine
[02:06:44] and think it's going to be the right solution every single time because times change. And that was a
[02:06:49] huge impact on my career moving forward. Yeah, I went through a similar transition in O-304 where
[02:06:56] we were breaching every door and we ended up hurting some people, you know, and sometimes not the
[02:07:03] right people. And we started getting some pressure like, hey, you can't just keep doing this.
[02:07:09] And so, well, if you're not going to explosively breach, then that leaves you mechanically
[02:07:13] breaching. If you're mechanically breaching, well, now you're sitting there with the Hoolie,
[02:07:16] swinging at a door and now you're really exposed. So why not just take a step back and say,
[02:07:23] hey, get the turpa on the horn and tell these guys to come out. And now we kind of know what we're
[02:07:28] dealing with. And yeah, as you can imagine, the pushback I got was was, you know, pretty strong
[02:07:36] from the guys because they're thinking we're giving up this tackle advantage. We should
[02:07:40] explicitly breach every time. And I was getting pressure from my boss. And what I realized is
[02:07:47] if it makes sense to explosively breach, awesome, we will do it. And I told my boss, if it makes
[02:07:52] sense for us to explosively breach, we're going to do it. And if we don't need to, we won't. And if
[02:07:56] we call out as appropriate, we call it as appropriate. So right there's three courses of action,
[02:08:01] which for the first few months I was there, there was one course of action. And how long
[02:08:05] it's to take the enemy to figure that out. And like you're saying, by what was this? Now this
[02:08:09] is 07 of course they'd figured out, oh, we can put a barricaded sandbagged position to room's
[02:08:15] deep, you know, on the main breach point. And we'll have a field day. Yeah, it was their M.O.
[02:08:21] I mean, look, guys often think about warfare and they think the opposing side is, are these
[02:08:30] shadows and these entities and these paper targets. These are creative human beings who aren't
[02:08:35] conform to convention. They don't have doctrinal time hacks and requirements that they have
[02:08:41] to abide by. They wake up, they use their imagination. And sometimes that imagination trumps
[02:08:46] the fighting force conventional tactic that you bring to bear and you got to adapt. You got to be
[02:08:53] malleable. Yeah, I mean, even the idea of what we ended up calling combat clearance. And I don't
[02:08:57] know if you guys call the combat clearance, but like, hey, we're going to open the door and we're
[02:09:01] going to look inside. Like, hey, I'm not why would I run in there? Yeah. And are there times
[02:09:07] you got to run in there? Absolutely. We're getting shot at in the hallway. I'm going to get into
[02:09:10] this room. We're getting shot out in the street. We're going to bust this door and we're going to
[02:09:12] get in this building. That's what's going to happen. But if we're safe in the street and it's
[02:09:16] secure and we open this door, oh, we breach the store. What do we run in for there? What do we
[02:09:20] run in? Why? Why would we do that? So again, that was another thing that was contrary to everything
[02:09:26] that not everything I had learned. But to the bulk of what I had learned, which is, hey,
[02:09:31] speed, violence of action. Like, we're going to get, when that door opens, we're going in. And
[02:09:36] I get it. There's plenty of times where that's the appropriate behavior. Absolutely. There's
[02:09:42] also times where that's not the appropriate behavior. And it's difficult to overcome what you
[02:09:46] always feel like what you learn is what you kind of prefer. Right? Whatever you learn first,
[02:09:53] whatever methodology you learn when you're a new guy, you think that's the way it is. And it can
[02:09:57] be hard to overcome that barrier. And there's a bias. There's an actual bias around that. I
[02:10:01] forget what the name of the bias, but there's a cognitive bias around whatever, oh, anchoring.
[02:10:06] So whatever you learn first, whatever piece of information you get first, that's kind of what you
[02:10:09] anchor to. Yeah. So it can be difficult to overcome and say, hey, wait a second, does this really
[02:10:14] make sense? And believe me, I mean, I met that stiff resistance with a lot of guys along the way.
[02:10:20] And what I try not to do was be like, you don't know where this does, I'd be like, okay, well,
[02:10:25] let's talk through it. You know, and actually, I'll tell you what, let's break out some semi-nation.
[02:10:30] And let's give it a shot. Why don't you show me how it works out when you go rushing into this room
[02:10:35] when you don't know what's in there. And there's no reason to rush in there.
[02:10:38] Look if you're getting shot out of the hallway, I get it. But if you're not,
[02:10:42] man, what are we doing? Yeah. Yeah. Don't be in a rush to die.
[02:10:49] So that was a freaking savage deployment then it was epic. And once again, what's you, you knew it
[02:10:55] at the time. I mean, every time every night you're loaded up for it's gone, you're, this is
[02:11:00] good as it's ever going to get. Yeah. I had multiple conversations with the guys in the team room
[02:11:07] in the kit room, getting loaded out like it doesn't get any better than this guys. Remember every
[02:11:12] single moment of this because you'll never get this again. How old were you? 26, 7. Yeah. But that's
[02:11:18] just a little bit your third deployment though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you got to relish it. I was
[02:11:24] comfortable and more. That was, that was, I was getting, I was fixing mistakes. I was making
[02:11:32] and honing this craft and I was getting pretty good at it. And you know, there was opportunities
[02:11:42] inside of my unit to do whatever I wanted to do. And I took all those opportunities. And it was,
[02:11:49] it was a great playing field for creativity. And we did a lot of cool stuff, man. It was, it was amazing.
[02:11:56] It was that task force, crystal, little task force was awesome. Colonel or sort of major,
[02:12:04] Command Sergeant Major NACI was the unit Sergeant Major at the time. And I remember we had a team patch
[02:12:10] and a brief. And our team patch had some skulls on it. And it was like one of those,
[02:12:19] you know, badass like, Punisher school deals, right? And I'm thinking, Sergeant Major NACI's
[02:12:27] going to see this and he's going to be pissed. So during a brief, we're doing a brief
[02:12:30] up before loaded helicopter is saying, looks at it. And I see him side eye, one of the patches.
[02:12:35] And the patch says killed them all on the patch. And he kind of side eyes it. And I'm like, oh,
[02:12:41] shit. And I go to a, my, my cell line of my Jason dude, he's side eye and the patch was screwed.
[02:12:46] And this is the unit Sergeant Major. And so he, he comes over and he says, hey, who's, who's
[02:12:55] patches are these? And Jason steps forward. And he pulls them in the hall. He's coming with me.
[02:13:00] And he goes, so let me see that patch. And he pulls it off his shoulder. And I see this go
[02:13:04] down in the hallway. I'm like, oh, dude, this dude is like Jason's going home. Like we're not doing this
[02:13:09] up. And he hands in the patch and, so our major reaches inside of his pocket and pulls out a handful
[02:13:17] of J-SOT coins that say, uh, task force and has all the numbers. It's a skull. And the backside
[02:13:24] it says, uh, something like operating at the speed of war. And he hands in the coins. He goes,
[02:13:30] it's the coolest patch of earths. And he slaps it on his arm. And he walks out on my dad
[02:13:35] did not go the way up. That's going to go. I was like, we're in the right place. This is, this is where
[02:13:39] it's at right now. Yeah. And this is where, this is where you lose people. I mean, mentally
[02:13:48] lose people. Yeah. Because if you, if you, if you, if you, if you don't know what we're talking
[02:13:56] about, if this sounds like a hyper aggressive or crazy or whatever, what you're forgetting is that
[02:14:07] the whole object of wars to kill the bad guys, that's what we're doing. That's the purpose. I remember
[02:14:13] I heard a story. They were, you know, I read some new story. And it was, I think it was a marine unit.
[02:14:20] And they were talking about the fact that this marine unit had, um, like a scoreboard on the wall of
[02:14:27] number of bad guys killed. And each one of them was like a K-bar. Like a little K-bar was drawn up there.
[02:14:32] And the tone of this article was, you know, just just disturbed by this. So can you believe that
[02:14:40] this is, you, US Marine Corps unit? And I think it's Marine Corps unit. We'll have these, you know,
[02:14:44] it's keeping score of the number of enemy that they killed and proudly display the K-bar knife. And
[02:14:52] I was just thinking, man, what, what do you think we're human over there? Yeah. What do you think we're
[02:14:56] doing over there? Now, where you got to be careful is, is, well, for one thing, you got to be careful
[02:15:03] because you got to, you got to protect your guys. And if you get them in that mindset, they can go too far
[02:15:06] with it. Of course, you've also got to be careful because you're not building good relations with
[02:15:12] civilians or reporters or the public, at least part of the public because part of the public goes,
[02:15:20] what are you doing? What do you mean kill them all? So it's a, it's a touchy thing to touchy subject.
[02:15:27] And yet the, the entire purpose of a military unit is to kill the bad guys. And man, I said this
[02:15:34] the other day somewhere and people were like freaking out about it. And, and I'm like, well, no,
[02:15:39] I mean, I understand you've got supply people, but we're little supply people supply. There's supply
[02:15:44] bullets so that the frontline guys get, what about the people that are, you know, collecting intelligence,
[02:15:49] whether collecting intelligence, so the frontline guys can go kill people like everyone, that's what we're here for.
[02:15:53] That's what we're here for. There's no other thing and ensure are there humanitarian missions? Yes,
[02:15:59] are we going to try and win hearts and minds? Yes, all those things, all those things are secondary,
[02:16:04] the fact that the military, the military is to kill bad guys. Are they here to protect and defend? Yes,
[02:16:09] absolutely. How do they protect and defend? Kill bad guys. That's it. So you wrap up that
[02:16:18] deployment. Wrap up that deployment and then, uh, start doing advanced training. I mean, I have a lot
[02:16:24] of catching up to do so, um, because you don't have four back to back to back to back to the
[02:16:28] deployments. Yes. Yeah. And every break every month or every day of break is getting more honoured,
[02:16:36] you know, like you need to get more trained. Um, I think that year in between those rotations,
[02:16:43] I went to Cyberschool, I went to FreeFall School, I went to JTAC School, um, all to, again,
[02:16:50] become an asset, more of an asset on my team. So I went to Special Forces, Cyberschool.
[02:16:54] Of course, how long is the Special Forces Cyberschool? A couple months. It's pretty long. I think it's
[02:17:00] two and a half months. A little bit of technical, uh, a lot of tactical, a lot of long gun,
[02:17:07] but it's evolved over time. Um, Rangers go to that same school,
[02:17:11] Cax, and I appreciate that same school, and Special Forces Cyberschool, that school as well.
[02:17:16] Great experience. Learned a lot. I think I got to those out of that break. What I learned most
[02:17:22] was the difficulty of close air support. I was one of the few guys that got picked up and
[02:17:28] tasked to go to school, and I'm like, I'm going to so tack with SoTAC, and the Special Operations
[02:17:33] Terminal Air Control School, I'm like, dude, I want to go to SoTAC. I'm like, look, if you're a
[02:17:37] sniper and you're doing sniper operations, you want to keep the team small, somebody has to have
[02:17:45] that skill set. So you can drop bombs. I'm like, well, that makes sense. All right, does that mean
[02:17:49] I'm tethered to a radio likely, but it means you'll kill more bad guys. I'm all about that. So they sent
[02:17:54] me to one of the most difficult schools I've been to a SoTAC by the way. How long is that school?
[02:17:58] Uh, a few weeks. I think three weeks, two couple weeks of ground, and then an air week where you
[02:18:03] call lifefire, and uh, all different aircraft and platforms. All the, uh, only school I've almost failed.
[02:18:10] Really? I was, I was, I was worried about it. The technical aspects of speaking big,
[02:18:16] military language, like, lat long. I mean, I could speak M. G. R. S. and Braille. Like, I'm good at M. G. R. S.
[02:18:23] But then they said, lat long. I'm like, what the hell is lat long? So, so the Air Force controllers
[02:18:29] that I went to, they're like, you don't know what lat long I'm like, dude, I've never even heard the
[02:18:34] term. Like, what's lat long? Like, I have to learn this. Like, it's all that long, because you have to
[02:18:38] communicate to the aviators. And they speak lat long. Like, oh, no. And so I was, you know, doing the home
[02:18:44] work late at night. I was a senior E7. I was a class leader. And I was played running. I almost failed
[02:18:50] that course. So I was this close. And I think the Air Force dudes there, they would, it didn't
[02:18:55] want to see me pass. They, they were a little stout. They're like, oh, the senior SF guy, the
[02:19:00] students don't. He's played running. They have savages for, yeah, they wanted to see me fail out.
[02:19:04] I passed out. And I got my air, uh, close air support certification. And then a rotated back
[02:19:10] into O8, another war. And what are you doing this last, last time in O8? So O8, um, I was a troop advisor
[02:19:17] for the ICTF. Uh, the Iraqi counterterrorism force was born and bred by the SIF companies, A15,
[02:19:26] and B23, uh, fifth group, uh, SIF and third group SIF pulled these guys into Jordan,
[02:19:33] isolated them, trained them, and then infiltrated back into the country, smashing bad guys. And the ICTF,
[02:19:40] the young operators of the ICTF, they don't get bricks. They don't get a, uh, a red cycle, right?
[02:19:49] They, they stay in warfare and they, through the common of years of war, we got the most
[02:19:54] experience and we're some of the most experienced operators I've ever served with. So I advised
[02:19:59] the whole troop, and at the time we were downsizing American forces. So me, a Navy EOD guy, a Kamo guy,
[02:20:07] maybe Kamo guy, and then a troop full of ICTF, Spinka targets. So what time of, in 2008, were you there?
[02:20:16] Well, the entire, the entire summer, so probably March, April, timeframe until, you know,
[02:20:22] six months into it, almost a Christmas. And this is smash in targets. All, we are calling them true
[02:20:29] bilateral operations, right? And we're trying to work ourselves out of a job. A lot of guys
[02:20:34] were bummed out by it. Um, things were getting political in08. Uh, I was signing shooter statements.
[02:20:40] If I was admitting that I was killing bad guys, which we start stop doing. I mean, we stop in
[02:20:44] meeting, we were killing bad guys because at that time, if you killed a guy, you were a shooter
[02:20:49] statement and it went to the DOJ and I rack. Uh, I actually remember one time I came back from an
[02:20:56] op and my commander, my company commander comes to me goes, hey Mike, you're good to go back out
[02:21:01] on op's. I was like, I just got back from an op. Sir, what are you talking about? Oh, you,
[02:21:07] you're being investigated for that last shooting yet. I'm like, what? What would you mean
[02:21:13] investigated? Like, well, yeah, they had to do a trial process and they took it to trial. They
[02:21:17] did the shooter statement with witnesses and everything else and then you're good. I'm like, what?
[02:21:22] I don't want to my team star and I'm like, dude, what is going on? They're, we're going on
[02:21:26] trial and through paperwork and then we're shut down from operations. He's like, yeah, it's part of
[02:21:32] the climate. I'm like, uh, and it's, it's, it's one of the first times in, in, in, in leading because
[02:21:39] I was leading a troop, uh, entire troop of ICTF that I started getting affected by the political
[02:21:46] climate. All the other times I've been insulated by cell leaders team sergeants, good leadership
[02:21:52] who knew that they just keep all that shit away from the guys and let them do their job. And
[02:21:58] it's the first time it started trickling down and I'm like, oh, a wow. Yeah. Yeah. The house thinking
[02:22:03] about that when you're talking about your OSF and deployment, I mean, your, your focus was
[02:22:07] 100% on your job. That's it. And so the people above you and Jane and Cran, and that's a,
[02:22:13] that was a superlative supportive chain of command as well. Yeah. And so you weren't dealing with
[02:22:22] any of this other crap. No, I'm shutting you up and oh, eight. And you find out you're under
[02:22:26] investing. Super political. Yeah. Super political. So did you, uh, you just kept doing ops
[02:22:33] backed off a little bit. Did you back off a little bit or did you, so the ops weren't as
[02:22:38] aggressive. Like I remember telling my new guys because I was selling it at the time in a troop
[02:22:41] advisor. I remember telling my new, siff guys, bro, it's about to be on. Get your stuff ready,
[02:22:47] bring the thumper plenty of 40 my mic, we're about to kill some bad guys. And go, and we went
[02:22:53] in the solder city and it was crickets. And I'm like, this isn't normal. I was like, dude, it's
[02:22:57] gonna happen. Yeah, I'm bushed. EFT's nothing. And I'm like, what is good? We got back. I'm like,
[02:23:02] no, that that was probably just random. We're, we're gonna get back into it and we're gonna go
[02:23:08] kill. But, and they, they, we get went out again and I'm like, there's nothing happened. What is
[02:23:12] going on? And because of the, at the times, the Sunnis and the Shia's were doing a ceasefire.
[02:23:21] And anytime they killed Americans, they would pay for it politically. They started pulling back
[02:23:26] and just isolating, building their, their infrastructure and their castles and not do not
[02:23:33] be an aggressive. But all the things that we were hit were dry holes. We, we got in a few gunfights,
[02:23:39] killed a few dudes. But it was, it was not what I expected it to be. And it was the transition of
[02:23:44] what became, I think the transition out of that, that fight. Yeah, no, and one of my buddies
[02:23:51] took over my task unit and went into solder city with snipers in, I want to say it was
[02:23:58] June of 08. Yeah. And they killed all kinds of bad guys. And I did about four to six weeks of operations
[02:24:04] there and the freaking, the shakes there kind of like, all right, we're good. We're good. We don't,
[02:24:11] we don't need any more of this. Yeah. And they made that truse and stuff. Yeah. And you know,
[02:24:16] the way I looked at it was like, they'd been doing operations for so long. Like the, the, the, the,
[02:24:22] the, the, the, the, the body army and stuff out of solder city. And they would take so few casualties.
[02:24:27] Yeah. I mean, they go out, set off in the F. P. killed an American or two or what, you know,
[02:24:32] go, go, lob, and like I said, they don't really have to, they don't have to win every time. Like
[02:24:38] it doesn't matter. They're going to go back and they'll attack again tomorrow night or the next night.
[02:24:43] And, but then once they started taking some massive casualties, yeah, we're like, I think we've had enough
[02:24:48] for this. Yeah, it was pretty much, I remember that time period, um, so I was a sniper at the time.
[02:24:52] So in between my troop at being up, I did stay behind sniper operations. And we actually took
[02:25:00] from what I understand, we took one of the missions that you guys had. You guys were doing daylight
[02:25:06] Overwatch for the guys who were building the T-bearious around solder city. And you guys killed a whole
[02:25:11] bunch of people. When we came in, they switched it to night ops. And we couldn't kill anybody. Like,
[02:25:16] I sat on rooftop for like days and weeks going, where they held all the back guys and, and
[02:25:21] guys were talking like the Navy killed them all. Like, where are they, they're like, they're not coming
[02:25:25] out. They all gave up. There, if once you did reverse ops, uh, that tactic worked because they were
[02:25:32] getting smoked in daylight. And so I, and I think Chris Kyle at one point had that up. And, um, so
[02:25:37] I remember, we remember hearing about his name and some of the guys and like, oh, do they have a
[02:25:42] high body count? We were so excited. And we end filled day one. I was like, crickets and I'm like,
[02:25:46] what is, and they had a, they had a drone. I remember seeing a drone overhead. And they were
[02:25:51] low-flying this drone during the building of this wall and the completion of it. I'm like,
[02:25:56] no wonder there's no bad. Like, all the bad guys here, this drone on purpose, uh, as a tactic
[02:26:01] that we applied, but they're all keeping their head down. And we couldn't kill any of them. And I was
[02:26:05] like, oh, this sucks. But the, the stay behind stuff was fun. Yeah, that, that was a big kind of
[02:26:10] of, uh, whatnot. When I was in Ramadies, the same thing, like the bad guys were, they knew not
[02:26:15] to come out at night. Now, yeah, 90, whatever, probably 97% of the bad guys that got killed by my
[02:26:22] task, and it, one of the daytime. Yeah. The other 3% were at night, because they knew if they came
[02:26:26] out at night, it was a bad deal for them. Free fire. So they came out the day. And it's the same
[02:26:32] thing that those guys didn't saw their city. Um, that's another, so it's another deployment
[02:26:40] another six months, this six months. Yeah. And just going out hitting targets, but it's definitely
[02:26:45] more melow on this deployment. Yeah, it was more of a, uh, a leadership role in troop advising
[02:26:51] the surmager, because I was acting as the ground force commander for every op. So I, I started learning
[02:26:57] a lot about processes. You know, like before I was just in a nougat altar, I was called a ghost
[02:27:02] assaulter, just there doing my little narrow piece of the pie. Now I had to step back and get the
[02:27:08] big picture. I had a control way to assets. I had to flex the different targets. I had a strategize
[02:27:14] on the fly with my troops aren't major deploying his troops. And we had a whole bunch of incidents
[02:27:19] like we're, you know, me and the EOD guy, the Navy EOD guy, are hitting targets by herself,
[02:27:25] because they're hitting a building. We get intel. I don't have enough time to flex that whole
[02:27:29] troop. We have to do it. So we go inside a house as by herself. And it was fun, man. We had a blast.
[02:27:35] It was like it was cool because we had the leash off. And even though it wasn't as active, I mean,
[02:27:41] we were doing, I remember we had an intel from a soccer field that they had a couple handsets that
[02:27:46] correlated to the soccer field. And I was like, all right, we got to get the soccer field. So I said,
[02:27:50] hey, guys, we're going to move to the soccer field. So we started walking. I'm like, I need you guys
[02:27:54] to move out. And they wouldn't move out. I grabbed the EOD guy. We sprinted to the soccer field.
[02:27:59] As we ran around the block, we were in ambient street light. The group of guys were meeting and
[02:28:06] they were in the middle of the soccer field, the middle of night, like two in the morning. They see us.
[02:28:10] And we're sprinting across an overfield, trying to shoot like 10 dudes who move in 10 different
[02:28:15] directions. And we miss everybody. And when we get back the, everybody in the jock and the talk is
[02:28:21] laughing, because they're like, dude, that was the best we've ever seen. Because we saw you guys
[02:28:25] break contact from the main element and you're like screw it and you start sprinting. But they all
[02:28:29] went 10 different directions. So we could track any of them. And we're running and shooting. And we're
[02:28:34] standing there in the field like damn it. That was our opportunity. It was a good time, Sner.
[02:28:41] Wrap up that deployment. Then what's next? So I, I, I get back and I go to Cag and I'm in Cag
[02:28:47] and a, a technical role reconnaissance role. And I go back to Iraq and to Belad. And I, I, I run
[02:28:55] because of my reconnaissance background, it's how I got recruited in. I run a joint interagency task force
[02:29:02] of, um, interagency organizations with J. Sock to do reconnaissance over the entire country of Iraq.
[02:29:11] I was, I was undercover as a lieutenant colonel. So I was an OIC, young OIC. Nobody believed it.
[02:29:17] Um, but put it in that position to C2 and control all the things that were going on for
[02:29:25] reconnaissance assets in the country. Now in Belad at that time period, because everything was
[02:29:31] downsizing and including the base of Belad. A year is this now? Oh, nine. Yeah. So stuff's
[02:29:36] really slowing down. Really slowing down. In fact, the reason they brought me in is because
[02:29:40] reconnaissance is obviously another way we get involved without involving packs on the ground,
[02:29:47] people on the ground. So we still had a, have eyes on, but we had to use technical means of reconnaissance
[02:29:54] and that just depend on dudes and hide sites. In fact, during that time period, um, there was
[02:30:00] a restriction of one of two Americans per target and you had to stay in containment. So if you're
[02:30:04] moving to a bad guy place, you leave behind the Americans, they'd stay on containment with the
[02:30:09] vehicles, um, indigenous force would hit the objective, come back and then you roll out. And so at that
[02:30:15] time, working in the joint interagency, I didn't feel like I was missing out on much. I felt like I had a
[02:30:21] broader role to fill in that capacity. And then, and you're just overseeing all this reconnaissance
[02:30:27] elements. That's what you're saying. All of it. I had daily VTCs with a SILTIM command,
[02:30:34] NAVS OFF, mostly, which was the main effort. Not the way. There wasn't a lot of SF guys in the
[02:30:39] country admit at that time. So I had daily VTCs with a Navy and supported their operations and
[02:30:45] technical reconnaissance means tagging, tracking, locating all the, all the sexy stuff for
[02:30:50] technical recon, um, for the entire country. And that was based on the fact that you had sniper
[02:30:56] experience. Yeah, I got recruited. Con and experience or whatever. Yeah, I got recruited. I want to
[02:31:01] selection or successful. And then, um, my background, my entire life, my background and special
[02:31:07] operations was mapped for that, that field of expertise. In the transition, coming back from
[02:31:13] 08 to 09, I went to J. Sox, technical reconnaissance course, which was like six months,
[02:31:19] pretty intense course, and learned a whole new world of operations that I didn't even know existed.
[02:31:26] I knew a little bit, but when I went to that course, I was like, whoa, now this is, this is in
[02:31:30] Koshit. So I did that for Task Force for J. Sox for my own non-rotation. And then what happened after that?
[02:31:38] Gat back and then, um, got with another squadron. And at that time, we had been in Iraq,
[02:31:46] since we killed Zarkawi. The task force has a mid-NiRAC, um, really since, I mean, intermittently,
[02:31:53] we, we own Iraq. But Afghanistan, we completely gave up. So, I wasn't on the ball and Afghanistan,
[02:32:00] because we were too busy in Iraq. And then all of a sudden, we had to change a heart.
[02:32:05] Look, Akhaita was on the run. We didn't even know this thing called ISIS existed. And we decided to do
[02:32:12] a surge as an organization to Afghanistan. And I was on the first thing smoking. So my first
[02:32:21] real good deployment with that organization, with a special mission unit, was in Afghanistan. And
[02:32:28] when we got there, um, the Rangers on the Battle Space, Colonel Carilla was in charge,
[02:32:35] and we were the red headed step-children. And I was like, what? How is an SMU the step-children?
[02:32:41] Like, when I got there, I was taking showers with bottles of water, and it opened field. And I'm like,
[02:32:46] this is the prepare C.T. unit on the planet. And I'm doing this and they're like, dude, we have,
[02:32:51] we're building everything from scratch. So we set up shot there and started targeting bad guys.
[02:32:56] And the first two months was prep. And then the second two months was killing bad guys.
[02:33:03] And we did a lot of it. That, that, that second 60 days of that four-month rotation.
[02:33:09] We saw more bad guys killed in a two-month period than anything that I experienced before.
[02:33:14] You know, it was because of the assets that we brought to bear. Good rotation, though.
[02:33:18] And you were, you were still over seeing Recky at this point? Yeah, I was, I was that squadron's
[02:33:23] reconnaissance in CO, which just specialized in Reckon. So everything from OP's to technical
[02:33:31] Recky to inner agency, like even controlling aircraft for for ISR. And he was an active trip.
[02:33:40] I mean, we lost a dog. We had a guy's shot. We had a guy's blown up. A lot of active operations
[02:33:47] during that period of time. It was, it was amazing to see that talent and you can't really get an
[02:33:54] idea or understanding of that talent and capability when you, when you focus on individuals.
[02:34:00] But when you see it come together in a single combat operation where everybody's so efficient and
[02:34:06] effective, you really see the benefit of the selection process, the training process, and the
[02:34:13] support mechanisms that make that unit the most elite unit in the world.
[02:34:19] Yeah, you know, you hear like the sports analogies of like, well, you know, it's like a professional
[02:34:25] sports scene, but these are like the champions, right? These are the NFL, three can superbow winners.
[02:34:31] That, you know, that you see the superbow guy that like, whatever gets his right arm massaged
[02:34:38] so that he can whatever and he and this other guy's doing speed drills with the first four meters
[02:34:43] of his sprint and he's going to work with a specialist that's going to get him even a little bit,
[02:34:47] you know, one millisecond faster and then they're getting their helmets dialed in so that they
[02:34:51] can have comms in there and they got this, they got all like at just 100% pure focus for every
[02:34:57] individual to be as good as they possibly can. And then you put that team together and every one of
[02:35:04] those individuals is 100% focused on being as good as they possibly can with all the support
[02:35:08] they could possibly want and this is what you end up with just freaking the best.
[02:35:13] Yeah, it's the big leagues for sure. And I, when I realized and that you know, even being a very
[02:35:18] confident shooter, a respected member of special forces and being a PT start at the time,
[02:35:26] that there was men above me and beyond me that I'd never catch up with that were just so talented.
[02:35:33] And I was like, it was humbling and I'm like, well, I'm not the most elite dude. I thought I was.
[02:35:38] I woke up and went, dude, I'm crushing it and then I see the talent pull over there and
[02:35:42] realized there's this thing, this machine. And like you said before, these guys
[02:35:50] aren't trained to be diplomats to be fit experts, the training kill bad guys and they're the best
[02:35:55] at it. I mean, the Navy version and the Army version, they're the best at it in the world.
[02:36:00] And then it was humbling and honorable experience at being part of that.
[02:36:06] So what came after that? So at a very young age, actually at the age of 29, I made
[02:36:13] E8. How's your wife handle it on all this, by the way? She's good. She's a champ at the time.
[02:36:17] I don't, she's never ready to me now. So it's the last. But she's handling it well, man. I mean,
[02:36:23] look, she, her perspective was, if I was happy doing what I loved, that was my moment in time
[02:36:32] and she would support me. Do you have any kids? No kids. No kids. None. So it was easy for us.
[02:36:37] Right? She was busy getting our nursing degree, phenomenal woman, just handling business and grinding.
[02:36:44] And then when I came back, she was my support and make sure, make sure, because you knew I was coming
[02:36:51] back and in that unit, especially those boys don't have any downtime. It doesn't exist. Even when you're
[02:36:58] down, you're not down. You're up on a call cycle for being able to quick respond or you're in a
[02:37:06] down cycle and you're training. You're always gone. I was gone more than any part of my career in
[02:37:11] that organization. So when I made the E8 list, I made it on the black side. There's the black
[02:37:20] list and the black list is just, it's an advertised. And I was just to give, I don't know the exact numbers,
[02:37:27] but for that year, it was something like 160 guys were promoted. I was 159.7 on the black list,
[02:37:36] because the black list, like you're like an intermittent number, that's not advertised. I was the last
[02:37:40] guy on the black side, which includes the Navy that was promoted to E8, which means I was the last
[02:37:46] guy to get picked up and I was 29 years old as an E8. Yeah. And so I, you know, it was mainly because
[02:37:55] of the combat experience I had and then in E7 school, which is for us is called Adenak, I won the
[02:38:00] leadership award. And so those two things set me up to get promoted that fast, but I wasn't prepared
[02:38:05] in my operational career to go, you're an E8. What's next? So if I stayed in that unit, then I
[02:38:13] would have just been what I was, you know, in that unit, you're not, it's called Blue Chips. You don't
[02:38:22] get Blue Chips because you have experience. You could be a 20 year special operations guy. When you
[02:38:27] show up that unit day one, you earn your Blue Chips one day at a time. And so me starting, I would
[02:38:34] starting from zero, leaving the unit and going anywhere I could have gone, I'm a team starting.
[02:38:41] I'm a god in the special operations, right? And it's the job that you want because you're controlling
[02:38:48] and an operating with your ODA with your detachment. I had no, look, I wanted to go back, but I was like,
[02:38:56] if I go back, they'll put me on a regular ODA and not meeting that in a derogatory way,
[02:39:02] but just not a SIF company, not a specialized company. Randomly, gentlemen by the name of Command
[02:39:09] Sergeant Major Bob Erbie, who's a legend in Social Forces Command, communicates to me that he
[02:39:15] hurts. I've heard I may de-eate and he heard about my experience and he wanted to recruit me to
[02:39:19] stand up a new career, a new commander's response force for the, the continent of Africa.
[02:39:26] We didn't have one because we were so busy fighting in the Middle East, we didn't have one.
[02:39:30] Jay Sock approved that and long story short, I stood up a SIF as a plankholder from scratch.
[02:39:37] We went into a company in 10th group, me and another guy from the unit, stood it up from scratch,
[02:39:43] had full power to train anything we wanted to with our guys, reconnaissance guys, and build this unit from
[02:39:51] zero. As we built the unit, we got vetted and validated and then Benghazi kicked off, which
[02:39:58] my or benefit wanted to be in in Africa. So when did you deploy immediately? I deployed immediately.
[02:40:04] I was the first team to deploy for that unit, two Benghazi, to Libya. This is after the September
[02:40:09] 12th of tax. Yeah, September 11 and 12, a tax in 12th in 2012. During our train up,
[02:40:18] we literally get tasked to go to Libya. We start developing intel and then Benghazi kicks off.
[02:40:24] And when that happened, I was actually in a special mission, genic compound, doing cross
[02:40:29] K Ali briefs with Libya and then this thing happens. And then a few weeks later, I'm in Tripoli,
[02:40:36] Libya going building out a counterterrorism force going after Abukutal, the guy responsible for it.
[02:40:44] Did you run it? We didn't run any of those ops though, did we?
[02:40:49] So one, we didn't do anything about it. It was a big 13 hours in Macauze, he was kind of reflective of
[02:40:58] that understanding. But we had the opportunity to kill Abukutala in about 60 to 90 days.
[02:41:06] There are other use of sock elements with us and they positively identified that dude in a short period of time.
[02:41:12] I was there in the meeting when we proposed it to the country team, which included the ambassador
[02:41:16] Sharjay, Alexander Pope, who was appointed and he denied it. He said the political climate
[02:41:23] would allow us to do this. The representative from Yisosak, senior E8, stood up and almost detonated.
[02:41:30] I mean, he detonated in a very tactful way. But that was the climate we were dealing with.
[02:41:36] It was so politically charged, they wouldn't allow us to do anything. For six months, I was in that
[02:41:41] country fighting to kill bad guys, to do our job as to commanders' response force, but also
[02:41:47] representing Yisosak and they wouldn't let us do anything. It was horrible. It was the worst political
[02:41:54] military experience that I faced. So what you're doing, you got home from that.
[02:42:01] That had to leave a bad taste in your mouth. What did? Three weeks after I got back, I was out of the
[02:42:07] army. I dropped my paperwork as a senior E8. With how many years in? The time 16, 16 years.
[02:42:14] When I was down range, I got recruited by the CIA. I was going to take a job called
[02:42:20] Pair Military Operations Officer, which is a good-going U.S. or CIA.gov, an apply for my
[02:42:26] exiled job description there. Mike Span was one of the first casualties of the global war
[02:42:31] in terror in September 11th. He was actually a Pair Military Operations Officer. I wanted to be
[02:42:37] Mike Span. I had just finished my college degree, which took me 15 years to accomplish,
[02:42:42] which is a prerequisite for government service and federal federal government. And I decided at that
[02:42:49] point, I wanted to step aside and work for this agency because I saw the good things they were
[02:42:53] known. At the time, after I got back in out-processed, very rapidly, where people were like,
[02:43:00] my troop, the main element wasn't even home yet, and I was already out-processed. My independence
[02:43:07] was July 4th of that year of 2013, and immediately started contracting. Went straight back to
[02:43:14] Libya. I was in Libya on terminal leave back in Libya as a civilian, and then started contracting
[02:43:22] with the agency for the next two and a half years. While at the same time, I was in a reserve component
[02:43:30] of special operations, and where I was a team sergeant in Texas. They made sergeant major in Texas.
[02:43:38] And so I was contracting, deploying with an agency, coming home, and then deploying again, deploying again.
[02:43:46] Yeah, put on my uniform, jump on a plane. I mean, one time I came back from Yemen, a week later,
[02:43:52] I was back in the Zira Africa with a sort major uniform on doing a counterterrorism staff operation,
[02:43:59] or staff exercise that turned into an operation. Came back, put on my civilians, and then
[02:44:04] went back to Yemen. So I was just in a cycle of it. Give us a little bit of a brief on what we
[02:44:10] were doing as a what your job was as a contractor. So honestly, it's nothing sexy. I was babysitting
[02:44:18] case officers. I mean, my job was to protect him overseas. I was outside of the, what people would
[02:44:25] normally refer to as industrial contractor. So I actually worked directly for the agency and
[02:44:31] babysat case officers and protected them. When you're a case officer and you come out of school,
[02:44:37] you get a 500 pound head. Lots of experience in training, but it's all concepts. When they go overseas,
[02:44:47] we only have enough time to repair the biggest and brightest minds on the planet to do what they do.
[02:44:53] And so we, we are the, the shield that protects these guys to do their job. And at the time that I
[02:45:00] applaud, you had a minimum experience of six years and special operations, and you had a shoot
[02:45:05] to ask off. And when I showed up for this job, I've vetted, it's a shooting call. You shoot,
[02:45:12] and you beat the standard, or you leave. My class, we had probably 10, 10 dudes that are senior
[02:45:18] level dudes, operators, and the most elite units, half of them probably went home because of the
[02:45:23] shooting calls. You're competing for a six-fear job, also, so the pressure is high. And the shooting
[02:45:29] standards are the, the hardest shooting standards I've seen. Apparently in federal government,
[02:45:34] because you're a federal law enforcement instructor after you get through this experience,
[02:45:38] it's a toughest federal law enforcement call. That's informal. It's not actually doctrine.
[02:45:43] And when I went down range with that organization, I was confident that even me and my
[02:45:52] writing partner, typically were sales that with our little clock 17, P-shooters in the waste band,
[02:45:59] that we could do some work, enough to fight back to our vehicle or back to the machine gun
[02:46:04] in our vehicle and do some work. But it also taught me about what these inter-added season, these
[02:46:13] brave men and women do every day, which is they put it on the line. You don't have a QRF
[02:46:20] Ranger Battalion element in MH47's prepared to come rescue your ass. It's just you.
[02:46:26] And I'm like, dude, you guys do this? Yeah, we've been doing this since the beginning.
[02:46:29] Like, what? This driving around randomly, doing your thing and like, that's all. What's the nearest
[02:46:35] task force? Other but three hours away. Okay, so we're out on our own. That changed everything for
[02:46:41] me. I mean, that changed everything I thought that I potentially knew about single-to-noperations
[02:46:49] and lovis operations. We think lovis, our guy's thought lovis was like putting a shemag on,
[02:46:55] you know, and hiding their chest care or play care underneath their dress, their man dress.
[02:47:00] It's a new game. It's a new game. It was crazy. So you do that for two and a half years?
[02:47:06] Two and a half years. And did you, so you originally wanted to actually be in the CIA, not a contractor?
[02:47:16] You did, where you continued to try and pursue the job of actually being a member?
[02:47:22] Yeah, I wanted to be a staffer. I wanted to be a blue badge or I wanted to be a full-time employee.
[02:47:26] And I had to change a heart when I was in Yemen. Yemen was super political. The Houthis,
[02:47:32] the political climate, and all these things that were transpiring was doing what I didn't
[02:47:38] think was possible in that interagency, which was debilitating their ability to do their job.
[02:47:44] And I saw great guys that were on operational side, on the operational side that were getting stagnated.
[02:47:55] I couldn't believe it. I actually, I remember thinking to myself on one rotation,
[02:48:00] like this doesn't happen to these guys. There's no way. These dudes, there's no way these guys are
[02:48:05] getting. There's got to be something going on. Coconut dagger. And it wasn't because of the oversight
[02:48:11] of how the interagency the IC works in the intelligence community. With well over 17 agencies now,
[02:48:19] there's so much direct, direct, direct national level oversight and micro management
[02:48:26] that can't do their jobs. And so I had my whole thing with the internet on the military was,
[02:48:30] if I can't kill bad guys, I don't belong here. So I left because I went to an organization which I
[02:48:36] thought were still killing bad guys. And they still were in some capacity. But where I was in the
[02:48:42] situation I was in, they weren't. And I went dude, I have to have to change a heart here. I have
[02:48:47] to figure something out because the war for me is over. There's no more killing. I mean, eventually
[02:48:53] ISIS popped their heads up and there was a whole new cycle of killing that I missed, which I wish
[02:48:59] I was part of. But I had to make a decision to get out. And then that was it. That was it.
[02:49:05] I was in Pakistan and I made that decision. I brain stormed. My, my ride partner who was a seal,
[02:49:13] his brother was a dev group guy that was killed on a raid, a rest trying to rescue a hostage in
[02:49:18] Africa. And he's one of my best friends. And I said, hey man, I want to start a business.
[02:49:26] He's like, well, it's brain storm. And we had course of action development, man. We sat down
[02:49:30] after work and mapped out some plans and many conversations over dinner trying to figure out
[02:49:36] like what I could do. And, you know, with our background expertise, the obvious route is a
[02:49:44] tactical something, right? But I didn't want to do that, man. I saw these dudes who were getting out
[02:49:50] and they were dealing with all the backlash of coming out and saying, hey, I'm this guy.
[02:49:55] Because at the time I didn't have any social media. And I'm like, I don't want to be a tactical
[02:50:01] kind of guy. I want to do something kind of different. And I wrote down survival. And, you know,
[02:50:08] primitive survival is what most people would think about. And when they think about survival.
[02:50:12] But I said, what if there's this niche and developing like this modern survival take on preparedness
[02:50:18] of training citizens, not just military and law enforcement, but citizens to be better prepared
[02:50:23] in their culture? What year is this? This is 2015. Damn, so you were ahead of the curve.
[02:50:28] Yeah. Yeah. This is 15. And I'm like, there's something here. And I wrote a mission statement.
[02:50:34] I did a con op. I wrote a whole five-fair graph op order on the whole business plan. And
[02:50:41] resigned from my position with Interatency came home, talked to my command soldier major,
[02:50:47] as a Sergeant Major. I was an op Sergeant Major at the time. I said, hey, man, I'm thinking about
[02:50:52] doing this. Because dude, like, there's nothing going on. It's like we're about to activate the
[02:50:57] entire unit. And you'll be a staff Sergeant Major sitting in a talk for a year and I've got to stand.
[02:51:03] There's nothing going on. Do what you want to do. I said, how hard is it for me to resign?
[02:51:09] Because I will type the paperwork. That's how easy it is. And then I'll just send a team
[02:51:14] and you sign it for your position and your rank. You don't have to do anything. But technically
[02:51:19] resign. And you'll go into IR status, inactive, ready reserved. And that's it. And I remember I did that.
[02:51:27] And the next day I was like, holy crap. Like I just cut the biggest and
[02:51:32] political court known to man in history of man. And now I hear Flavin. And I have to make it
[02:51:39] make sure to happen. And are you still married at this point? I'm not. I'm three years removed.
[02:51:44] Or two years removed from a divorce. But you don't have to take care of anyone but yourself.
[02:51:52] It's just me. So it's kind of like a little bit of big on bell-cocard. But I mean, let's face it.
[02:51:57] You're going to be able to, you know, give me a ground pad.
[02:52:02] Yeah, I'm winging it, man. I'm, I think I probably was living in a ground like a pad.
[02:52:08] I was probably an air mattress in a, a band in place. I was smart with my money because
[02:52:14] they call it the Thousand Air Club because you, you make it in the Thousand a day in your bank
[02:52:18] roller. Most guys go home, blow it on Harley's and trucks and come back and start the vicious cycle again.
[02:52:25] But I took that money. I think it was 25k and invested it and started my business.
[02:52:31] What was the first move? The first move was education. I had no idea. Educating yourself. Educating
[02:52:37] myself. I had no idea about marketing about, um, like I have a degree in Homeland Security. What's
[02:52:43] going to translate to? Now, much in, in my new field of expertise. So I took my business plan,
[02:52:50] started doing, um, trying to build fidelity on the correlation between a concept and then the
[02:52:56] execution of that concept, trying to use historical data. And there was none. There was no good
[02:53:01] case studies or examples of businesses in that genre that weren't very narrow in their field.
[02:53:07] Primed us a rival. Yeah, sure. You can find a hundred business plans. They all suck and they're not
[02:53:11] doing very well. But what is this cultural thing of like this genre of call preparedness? Where mindset,
[02:53:17] self-awareness, uh, technical training, um, you know, all the things that we did in our culture
[02:53:24] and purpose and special operations. How does that translate to citizens? And how do you scale verticals
[02:53:29] in business? That was intense for me. Uh, it's something that I still learned today, you know,
[02:53:35] five years later with 40 plus employees. I'm like, dude, I'm still learning. I'm trying to figure
[02:53:40] in to show you what was the first move that you made then in terms of like what's the first gig that you did?
[02:53:45] So the first gig was a tactical training because I could make a revenue stream. So I'm like,
[02:53:50] wait, I figure out like a 12 to 24 people, $500 to slot, pistol carbine, let's make some revenue.
[02:53:57] Then I built the website. Then I started marketing. Social media for me was brand new. And I think
[02:54:03] at the time was new for people to see special operations guys doing it. I know at the time there's
[02:54:08] only handful of us doing that. And people were like, oh, and they gravitated towards us. I remember
[02:54:14] 10 Kennedy, I was his boss. Uh, 10 Kennedy was a, is an MMA fighter, um, um, um, uh, success launch
[02:54:20] of manure. I was his boss at the time and I'm like, dude, how are you doing this? He plugged me on
[02:54:25] his social media. I got 10,000 followers and I'm like, this is how it works. This network building,
[02:54:30] that's how easy it was. And so I started building it. I designed a survival kit. As a contractor,
[02:54:38] I went to, um, the luxury of doing the interagency direct contract position. I can go to any training
[02:54:44] I want to. And they sent me to a whole bunch of high-speed schools, including a survival school,
[02:54:49] where they had high-speed contractors who developed this like Ziplock back theory.
[02:54:54] There's this guy right now who works for a Kevin Estella. He's in the field right now,
[02:54:58] day two, doing a 72 hours Ziplock back challenge on a field cross survival and Instagram. And we're
[02:55:03] updating it. And the idea is, if you're in a foreign country that's semi-promissive, non-promissive,
[02:55:10] the worst case scenario for you is it loses its sovereignty. A coup happens and now you're on your
[02:55:15] own. The first star in the 50s that was applied to the CIA board was a guy who, uh, escaped and
[02:55:22] evaded from China and got killed and Tibet by a random security guy shot in the chest with one
[02:55:30] round with like a 32 British pistol revolver. Um, that's a thing and there's dangerous of it.
[02:55:36] So the idea is like a Ziplock bag is the things that you can carry on your person, your physical body.
[02:55:42] So I took that and I literally in the course went, everything you guys put in this bag,
[02:55:47] how did you guys come up with it? Well, we did R&D, like the best things that we could put in the bag
[02:55:51] and you're going to live out of it for 72 hours, which happens to be, uh, appropriate amount of time
[02:55:56] to escape, evade, um, and then carry the appropriate amount of stuff in reconnaissance, like not
[02:56:03] overbearing. And I said, I'm going to take everything in these bags and I'm going to turn into a
[02:56:08] survival kit and sell it. He's like, dude, you should do that. My valium doing it. And so I,
[02:56:13] our first survival kit, I sold like a thousand on day one of that kit. And I was like,
[02:56:19] there's something here. There's a product thing here. There's a training thing here. There's these
[02:56:23] revenue streams that I'm seeing and we built it from very small diversified and build up all the
[02:56:31] verticals, one by one. So you sell a thousand of these survival kits almost instantly.
[02:56:37] Instantly. So now your theory is correct. There's demand. There is demand. I'm creating a new
[02:56:43] demand signal, but there's demand. Um, that that starts off. What year is that?
[02:56:49] Six, the very beginning of 16, the very beginning of 16. So five years ago, you get the word out.
[02:56:58] You sell a thousand these kits. And so then what's the next move? Now you know there's a market,
[02:57:03] you start developing shit. What's next? Well, I think part of it was I have to develop a
[02:57:07] culture here. Like there's a, there's a thing that exists that I'm trying to redefine.
[02:57:12] Most people who think or have seen us on the surface even think that we're a primitive survival
[02:57:17] company because survival is synonymous with, with primitive survival, like rubbing sticks together
[02:57:21] in the woods. And so I'm not a big fan of that. I'm not an expert at that. There's guys that are
[02:57:26] talented at that. I hire those guys now, but that's not me. I'm the guy who understands that, you know,
[02:57:33] 20 operators can go out and deliberately hit the worst-case scenario and come out on top. And so
[02:57:39] in my hypothesis, like, why is that happening? Why do, why do intentionally men put themselves
[02:57:47] in harm's way to kill the bad guy and why statistically do they come out on top? And so if you
[02:57:54] start looking out and laying out all the reasons why, it's not because of one widget, one school,
[02:58:00] it's because the culture that are immersed in. They all got selected together, they train together,
[02:58:07] they pay attention to all the details. They can do contingency based planning. They have service support.
[02:58:11] They do course of action development. They rehearse. They pay attention to their equipment and
[02:58:17] everything they do. And ultimately they're conscious to their culture, their world. They're here
[02:58:23] right now paying attention to what they are doing. And when I look at citizens and everything that's
[02:58:28] happening in a world that we never learned lesson from, we're completely complacent and freedom
[02:58:35] as a benefit of freedom because we're comfortable in routine. And that happens to be our MO as
[02:58:42] Americans, which is beneficial, right? That you live in sovereign societies, you get all the luxuries and
[02:58:47] freedoms of all the man who go off to war and do this thing. But what is it to the detriment?
[02:58:53] Or what's the, if you look at statistics? And this is what I did. This is, this is the greatest
[02:58:58] start point is doing this research. I started realizing there's no understanding of what this even
[02:59:03] means. There's one guy that I found. There's a couple guys, but one guy significantly, by the
[02:59:08] name of John Leach, who did a study on survival psychology. He asked a question, why do people live
[02:59:14] and why do people die? Specifically in catastrophes. He has a theory based on his case study
[02:59:20] analysis of mostly natural disasters. Some of them man made that there's a breakdown of about
[02:59:26] 10, 80, 10. 10% of the population happens to be making the right decision and they survive.
[02:59:34] 80% probably broken in half, 50, 50. Sometimes the right decision, sometimes the wrong. And then
[02:59:40] 10% are the bottom of the barrel. They're like the guy who runs, this is in a survival situation
[02:59:46] of some kind. This is a catastrophe, disaster. So all of the things coming together typically
[02:59:51] associated with compressed timeline and high intensity stress. So the bottom 10% is the bottom of
[02:59:59] the barrel. And children happen to be in that bottom 10%. And so the question is why are some people
[03:00:07] at the top 10 and why are people at the bottom 10? And how do we get the people who are at the bottom?
[03:00:12] Even children into the top 10. And that was the premise of my business and answering that question.
[03:00:18] We need to figure out why people die. What is their background and experience? What mistakes they
[03:00:27] made and how can we put them in a bracket and a 10% bracket to make sure they survive? That was the
[03:00:33] question that had to be answered. That's where it started and then you started looking at, okay,
[03:00:39] what did you find? What did you find as far as a curriculum that you put together that moves people
[03:00:45] from the bottom 10? We're getting killed to the top 10. The most impactful thing that I found,
[03:00:51] which I see a lot of correlation in what your whether it's discovery or just dissemination of your
[03:00:57] books and all the information that you're doing is self-awareness breeds situational awareness.
[03:01:04] So there's this lack of awareness. There's really a lack of understanding. The analogy I like to use
[03:01:09] is to have a land cruiser. I'm a big fan of land cruisers. So I take my land cruiser, which is a 94
[03:01:17] land cruiser, which is FCG80, if your land cruiser nerd, head gasket problems are notorious for these
[03:01:23] things. They overheat their head gasket blows and then it's catastrophic. So the question is,
[03:01:29] when you're driving down the road and you see smoke, how do you address smoke? Most people see smoke
[03:01:35] and they go, oh crap, smoke, let me pull over, right? I'll call Triple A. So they have a dependence
[03:01:41] on something else. An institution, an insurance company, whatever it may be. And so they don't source
[03:01:47] source, the solution. Another course of action is you keep driving because you don't understand
[03:01:53] what's happening. So you just push through and you think that pushing through, hey, because it's
[03:01:57] only 10 minutes away from home is the answer. So you saw the smoke, you didn't have a answer.
[03:02:03] There's a void, a darkness in the back of your head. So you just do something random. It's randomized
[03:02:09] behavior. You drive, you get home and before you get home when you get down in your street,
[03:02:15] your car catastrophically in floats. You hear a pop, you hear noise. It starts the buck,
[03:02:23] you pull it over to side the road, you lift the hood and you realize you have a blown engine.
[03:02:27] Right? That analogy is representative of people's brains and the understanding of the brain.
[03:02:34] So a lot of things that we happen to us in our lives mostly affected by stressors,
[03:02:41] which happens to be a catastrophe, by the way. A stressor is just either low grade or high-grade
[03:02:47] catastrophe. We take stress, we start filling these things and then we don't know how to control it,
[03:02:53] we don't know how to diagnose it, we don't understand mechanical processes and then so we ignore it
[03:02:59] until it becomes catastrophic. So now you're in the vehicle accident and your only role is to do certain
[03:03:06] technical things to help the person who's burning alive, but you don't know how to do it. Why?
[03:03:11] Because you don't understand how to break glass. You don't understand the 42 that's required to
[03:03:18] push past the pain and break glass, or maybe if you understood technically that you could just crack
[03:03:22] off this wire and tin and slap it that you could shadow the glass. Or if you're even had more
[03:03:28] a forethought, maybe carry a tool, like a breaching ass, a wing cler-hape, a breaching ass, and you smash
[03:03:32] the window. But then you let that person burn to the ground. Hopefully it's not a family member.
[03:03:37] Hopefully it's not you. But this happens. And this little thing happens to everybody and some kind
[03:03:44] of circumstance. And what I tell people is if it hasn't happened, it's bound to happen.
[03:03:49] The difference between us and our experiences and civilians is that we've seen the detriment
[03:03:55] of not following these basic processes and the understanding of what take places when you don't
[03:04:01] understand them. So what I want to do is lint these processes and understanding so people can self-diagnose
[03:04:09] be aware of what's happening sympathetically, parasympathetically, and then give them more awareness.
[03:04:15] So when they see smoke, they go, oh that's not smoking all. That's water vapor. That's coming
[03:04:20] from our radiator. Oh I'm going to pull over. I'm going to let the car idle and sit. I'm going
[03:04:24] to let it cool down. Oh I carry gloves and a rag in the back of my car. I'm going to pop the
[03:04:29] radiator cap. Oh I realize because I looked in the reservoir, there's nothing in the reservoir.
[03:04:33] I carry coolant because I have a 94 and it eats coolant. I get coolant put it back in it.
[03:04:38] Top it off, sit it, let it idle. Everything seems fine and I'm on my way and I just survived.
[03:04:44] That whole thing is not done and a very tactful and intelligible way and I think we need to change that.
[03:04:51] So it requires processes, it requires progressive learning, it requires a lot of different paths
[03:04:56] that haven't been created, which is the business challenge because it's easy to articulate it,
[03:05:02] to do a podcast, to do a book, all those things, but to create a progressive path for civilians who are
[03:05:08] disinterested in the first place, it's the best in my opinion business problem to have because it
[03:05:14] lends itself to a new challenge, which I'm all about. So what are the courses look like? How do
[03:05:20] let's say you just sold me and I'm like, hell yeah I'm in the game, I'm freaking,
[03:05:26] uh, jocco the, whatever, insurance salesman and you just sold me. What do I do? There's three
[03:05:32] progressive paths to this. The first path is Phil Graserov, Phil Graserov.com. It's the website.
[03:05:39] It's physical training. It's like physical things that you can do. It's gunfighter pistol,
[03:05:43] gunfighter carbine. It's first a tactical combat casualty care. This is via a website via a website.
[03:05:49] So you're, for instance, on on on a video explaining to me how to put a turn of
[03:05:55] it on my kit. This component is you physically come to our training. Okay so there's a difference.
[03:06:01] So you said website, but then you said physical. So you go on the website. You get you sign up for the
[03:06:06] training, right? And then the, the in person physical training is one component of it.
[03:06:11] Uh, that training includes equipment, augmentation and equipment. Look, we're not the, we don't
[03:06:16] on them, and hopefully on medical gear. But I, I will sell you the best medical gear that's made.
[03:06:20] Uh, North American Rescue, the same cat seven turn of kits or cat turn of kits that we used.
[03:06:25] We've seen them save lives. So we sell turn of kits, survival kits, all the augmentation for
[03:06:30] enabling people to be better prepared. That's the fill cross survival. The second component is
[03:06:35] progressive learning. You have to be able to learn progressively at a start point and understand
[03:06:41] the path. I realize that deficiency years into this whole thing. Because people go, oh, I
[03:06:46] train gunfighter pistol, what's next? And I'm like, uh, gunfighter pistol too. And they're like,
[03:06:51] oh, we'll outside of that, what's next? Like, well, I need a holistic path to this. So we hired a
[03:06:58] girl, um, her name's Amber, stay at home, um, nurse. Somebody who understands LMS systems.
[03:07:05] We actually teamed up with Ozmore, which is a learning management based system. The same thing
[03:07:10] we did with online learning with your masters for my bachelor's, where we take, um, an online
[03:07:16] learning approach to get people involved including families. So you can go online. You could sell
[03:07:22] up, you could sign up on, uh, wetheprepair.com and sign up for an LMS component that includes,
[03:07:28] like, stop the bleed. So you take a class where you receive a turnic it, you apply that turnic it,
[03:07:33] and you have an interactive experience virtually. It's online learning, but it's for the
[03:07:38] preparedness minded. It's for people who, you know, who don't have the time or money to fly
[03:07:43] from North Carolina to Utah to take a physical class in person. So there's a progressive learning
[03:07:48] path that touches all the fields that we break down, what's called tellers of preparedness,
[03:07:53] which I can go over, um, of how we, how we, uh, disseminate this information. So people can
[03:07:59] understand it. The last component to that is what I've realized, uh, that preparedness is,
[03:08:04] is it's this thing that brings people together. That's not super toxic. Like everybody can get,
[03:08:10] if you're a liberal in San Francisco or a conservative and moral Montana, you can get on board
[03:08:16] that you need this idea of preparedness to make you better prepared for the worst case scenario,
[03:08:22] generally speaking. So when I have classes in person or online, I see this community building
[03:08:28] built based off of this one thing that's not segregating people, or that doesn't have toxic,
[03:08:34] underlined things about it, right? It's not French. So we started, uh, American
[03:08:39] contingency, which is a community-based program where if we educate people to be better prepared,
[03:08:45] what's next? What happens when you get around people that you like, because you're,
[03:08:50] you're thinking about the same considerations. Like, I want to take care of my family. I want
[03:08:54] to protect myself. Um, how can you inner operate? Well, there's, like, there's a, there's a,
[03:09:00] there's a bigger picture, right? The breakdown of the family unit, breakdown of, uh, communities.
[03:09:05] When we, me and you grew up, we knew our neighbors. We knew our, our neighbors, friends, and family.
[03:09:11] Now, if you see your neighbor and he's checking us now, you're like, you're like, who's that guy?
[03:09:15] Like, why is he looking at me? Like, that's her neighbor, man. Like, what do you do? Like,
[03:09:19] for the first time in history, you could be in an apartment complex with thousands of people
[03:09:24] in a vertical and not no one person and be disinterested and knowing anybody. But what do you do when
[03:09:30] you have to band together because our hurricane destroyed the infrastructure of your town? Well,
[03:09:36] American contingency, we actually have a members dot American contingency dot com that allows people
[03:09:41] to group and network. We have hundreds of groups that are inner operating now, that are like
[03:09:47] minded, that train together, that work together, that build assets and their capabilities together
[03:09:54] and then the break bread together, which is building relationships. So, and every tier,
[03:09:59] and this just happened, which, um, you know, look, I think the, the most impactful thing that you've
[03:10:07] done in your career and your, in your life is what you're showing in, um, and what you do and your
[03:10:15] actions outside of the military, right? So, it's somebody for me as a young entrepreneur I look
[03:10:20] at you and go, these are the right things, writing a book in publication that exposes your
[03:10:26] ideology and your thinking to impact young people who don't have anything to lean on and purpose
[03:10:33] is the most impactful thing that a human being could do, especially from our backgrounds. So,
[03:10:38] I said, I'm going to do pillars of preparedness, teachers thing, let me get a book deal.
[03:10:42] Well, nobody wants to touch me. For years, they thought I was French. I mean, I've been called
[03:10:49] everything from right-wing extremists, which is bizarre because I'm half Asian, um, to, um, you know,
[03:10:55] neo-nazzi to all this weird stuff because I'm, I'm talking about this idea being prepared.
[03:11:03] Just two weeks ago, I signed a book deal with a major publisher that vetted me for two years,
[03:11:10] which means they just paid attention about writing a book on preparedness. And I'm like,
[03:11:16] that's big, that's huge for me. One to be able to impact somebody via the written word which I
[03:11:22] grew up with is impactful, but to a publisher that published Michelle Obama and also Jordan Peterson,
[03:11:29] on both sides of the spectrum is taking a chance on me. And I am allowed, I'm, I'm, I'm humble
[03:11:35] by the opportunity allowed to have the opportunity to pass this word and mainstream to people
[03:11:42] who might be thinking about this, but don't know how to contextualize it,
[03:11:45] is a sign to me that this is making sense to people. Look, it's a hard genre because it's so,
[03:11:52] it's spread so thin. But the time and the place that we live in, our society right now,
[03:11:56] where people's cell phones, their virtual realities, are more important and significant than
[03:12:01] their actual reality. At the detriment to their physical and mental health and wellness,
[03:12:08] it needs, we need to be bringing this to bear in conversations, to get people involved in something
[03:12:14] outside of their cell phone. So it's my mission, but it's become something so different that I thought
[03:12:21] it was going to become as far as scaling a business for a call. Let me tell you what I think.
[03:12:28] This is what I think is very cool. And I was wondering if you would get there just from what you've
[03:12:36] seen so far to what my perspective is and what my perspective is is your sort of like,
[03:12:44] what everything you just said to me is the tip of the iceberg, actually. It's just the tip of the
[03:12:50] iceberg and I'll tell you what I mean by that. If you look it for me, GJ2. GJ2 for me was a huge component
[03:12:59] of my life, not because I learned how to fight, not because I got in good physical condition,
[03:13:04] but because I learned a new way of thinking. And I started to understand the world from a different
[03:13:09] perspective. And I started to see correlations between GJ2, combat tactics, leadership, interacting
[03:13:16] with other human beings, the way I approach problems, the way I thought. GJ2 became a way of thinking.
[03:13:22] And it's actually, I can't say it's GJ2 is that way of thinking because it's everything combined.
[03:13:28] It turns and translates into the sort of just the way of thinking for me.
[03:13:33] Well, when I start thinking about being prepared about handling situations, about reacting
[03:13:42] to emergency situations, about handling contingencies, all those things you can learn,
[03:13:50] you can learn for the specific, for the specific genre of actually applying to a survival
[03:14:00] situation, just like you can learn an arm lock for actually applying to a grappling situation.
[03:14:06] But guess what? You can take that mindset and you can apply to everything that you do. So you can take
[03:14:13] what you're teaching about thinking through a problem, about foresight, about preparing for a certain
[03:14:20] scenario and the contingencies around that. You can actually apply that not just to how you're
[03:14:24] going to handle a fire or an earthquake or a civil unrest, but how you're going to handle a business
[03:14:30] situation that you're in, how you're going to handle an interaction with someone in your own family.
[03:14:36] It's not a hostile interaction, but it's an interaction that you need to think through.
[03:14:40] So the way that you're talking about preparedness and I've told this to people before, they're like,
[03:14:46] well, you know, how good do you have to get a J2? Like if you need to, at a certain point,
[03:14:50] you're a blue belt, you're 225 pounds, Joko. You're okay. You can handle yourself in a self-defense
[03:14:57] situation. Yeah, absolutely I can. What about shooting? Well, what are the chances, Joko,
[03:15:03] that you're going to get into a gunfight? Your 49 years old, you know, you got a life in
[03:15:10] kids, you live in a nice area. What are the chances you're getting in a gunfight? Why do you need to be
[03:15:14] training? Why do you need to, why should I be training? People asked me, why should I work with a
[03:15:19] firearm? Well, let me tell you why. Because yeah, you have this narrow chance that for whatever
[03:15:25] reason somebody enters your house or you're in a situation, somebody tries to steal your car
[03:15:28] hurt you or whatever, where you got to use your firearm. The chances of that, let's face it. They're
[03:15:33] tiny. But guess what you get? Guess what you get from practicing and aren't like shooting.
[03:15:41] You learn how to control your breathing. You learn how to detach. You learn how to refocus after
[03:15:47] you throw a shot and still take the next clean shot without worrying about what just happened.
[03:15:52] You learn how to calm yourself down. You learn how to associate or disassociate from problems
[03:16:00] that are happening right in front of you. So there's applications to the art of shooting a weapon
[03:16:06] that you can apply to everything you could do. There's applications for what you learn in
[03:16:10] Jitu that apply to everything you do. There's applications to, if I went to one of your courses
[03:16:16] and you taught me how to what I should put together for a go bag for a car. Here's what you should
[03:16:22] think through. Cool. I can promise you. I'm going to use that. I'm going to put it go bag
[03:16:26] in my car and I put together a good one. But guess what else am I going to do? I'm going to think
[03:16:29] about a contingency for my business and what we can do as a business to prepare for a certain
[03:16:34] contingency. What do I need to prepare? What do I need to think through as a leader to be ready?
[03:16:42] So you're talking about a narrow, when you talk about this mindset of preparedness,
[03:16:49] you're talking about a pretty narrow thing. How am I going to survive a situation? To me,
[03:16:53] it's applicable to everything that a human being does. Why does a special operations guy
[03:17:02] when there's an earthquake or a flood or a car accident? Part of it, part of the reason that they
[03:17:08] survive is, hey, they know what to do. They know how to break a windshield. They know what to do in
[03:17:15] that specific technique. They technically know what to do. But part of it is, number one, they've
[03:17:21] been under pressure before. And number two, they know how to think through the problem that they're facing.
[03:17:26] So what you're teaching isn't only applicable to survival. It's actually applicable to everything.
[03:17:34] And that to me is it should broaden your audience to everybody. And I like the fact that you said,
[03:17:43] there's a certain alignment with what you're doing. The alignment is, you know, we run one of
[03:17:48] this with businesses sometimes. If you go higher up enough, the alignment ladder in a business,
[03:17:58] you know, you might want to do something one way. I want to do something different way.
[03:18:01] Ultimately, I say, hey, listen, do we want to take care of our clients? Yes, do we want to make some
[03:18:07] money? Yes, we do. Do we want to take care of the people on our team? Yes, we do. So we're going to be
[03:18:11] a line there. Like there's no one, you're not going to, if you and I earn business together,
[03:18:14] you know, I say, well, actually, I don't want to make any money. Or actually, you know, I want to
[03:18:17] screw over our clients. I actually know I don't want to take care of our team. You're not going to say that.
[03:18:21] And if you did say that, we were not working together. But 99% of the time you go to any business,
[03:18:25] they, you can go to a point where you're aligned, where you and I are thinking the same, hey,
[03:18:30] listen, we want to take care of our clients. We want to take care of our team. We want to make some
[03:18:34] money. We can agree with that. What you just said, I don't care where you're from. I don't care where you're
[03:18:39] from. You take, what did you say, a liberal and San Francisco or a freaking redneck in Montana?
[03:18:47] And you pull them into a room and say, do you want to be able to take care of your family?
[03:18:51] What are they going to say? They're going to say yes. Do you want to be able to handle
[03:18:54] yourself in a pressure situation? They're going to say yes. Do you want to be able to take care of
[03:18:57] yourself? They're going to say yes. So there's an alignment that's inherent in what you're teaching,
[03:19:04] that absolutely will bring people together. But it'll make them better, not just because they're
[03:19:08] able to survive. It'll teach them a way of thinking that will progress them in every aspect of their
[03:19:15] life. And that's why I think it's even more powerful than what you're saying because I could take
[03:19:22] some company executives and send them to one of your courses. And yes, it's a cool benefit
[03:19:29] that they're going to learn about survival. Just like I run a program where we take our guy,
[03:19:33] we take civilians. We teach him how to do a room clearance. We teach him how to move between
[03:19:37] buildings. This is a 45 minute session. How to clear a room and how to move from building to
[03:19:45] building in a group. That's what we teach him. Then we say, okay, here's your mission. And we start
[03:19:49] giving omissions. Now, what do they learn about clearing buildings? Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter at
[03:19:55] all. But what do they learn about leadership? What do they learn about thinking under pressure?
[03:19:59] What do they learn about how to get people to move in the right direction? What do they learn
[03:20:03] about being able to detach and take a step back and not get caught up in the firefight? We use
[03:20:08] we use later attack. Not get caught up in their laser gun and freaking out about that.
[03:20:13] So we take people and put them through this tactical training, not so that they can become
[03:20:18] great tacticians. But so that they can lead better. So what you're doing, hey, listen, it's great.
[03:20:24] You put people through some training that they learn survival skills. But to me,
[03:20:29] an even higher up of a higher archie of benefits is that they learn a way of thinking.
[03:20:37] That's going to benefit them in every aspect of the life. I think that's badass.
[03:20:40] Yeah, appreciate it. The lesson is learned that we found is exactly that most often
[03:20:48] people aren't exposed. They have limited exposure. So when they have the opportunity to do something
[03:20:54] like a five-day experience, we do corporate training. We've done it. I've consulted for Oracle
[03:21:01] and some other companies. It's not about like you said the technical experience. The bottom line
[03:21:07] is they're not going to learn enough reps to build that technical expertise unless that's on their
[03:21:11] own. But the life lessons they learn and taking it back and processing stress like you said
[03:21:17] is so important and valuable. I think what's happening with this introduction of technology in our lives
[03:21:24] is its limiting our ability to be exposed. So one of the advice is that I give for people
[03:21:32] who are like, how do I change my mindset? A lot of people say mindset, mindset, what the hell does that
[03:21:37] mean? And our field of expertise has to do with resilience. Your ability to bounce back, your
[03:21:43] ability wants to press the bounce back and to be stronger to thrive instead of just survive and get by.
[03:21:49] So when we expose people to new challenges, it doesn't have to be extreme. You could just,
[03:21:56] I mean we have extreme versions of this. We do sear school. We'll get a civilian sear school
[03:21:59] which is fun to run. But those guys will come back from that experience from a five-day sear
[03:22:04] experience survival escape resistivate and they'll go, this is the most impactful thing I've ever
[03:22:11] done in my life and I'm like, really? Okay, let me reflect on my impactful experiences.
[03:22:19] Oh yeah, Ranger School. When I was in Ranger School and I'm exposed and I'm vulnerable,
[03:22:25] it's impactful because it's something different and we understand this obviously about even singled
[03:22:30] celled organisms. If you're exposed to trauma, that is the first stage in growth because no
[03:22:37] growth takes place without exposure to trauma. And so whatever that form factor is, getting
[03:22:41] pummeled on the mats and jujitsu, you are learning as you go. You're breaking to build. And so
[03:22:49] what's fascinating about this whole movement that I think is preparedness is that it's positive.
[03:22:55] There's not a lot of negative things that take place in preparing people to be
[03:23:00] prepared for that worst case scenario. You see a lot of positive impacts on community with law and
[03:23:06] enforcement, with relationships, with peoples understanding. And for me, getting all this collective
[03:23:15] of information and making sense of it and being able to clearly disseminate that is the biggest
[03:23:20] challenge. But it's the funniest thing about the business. I mean, the LMS, for example, of creating
[03:23:26] this idea that you could learn online and you could learn about these life-saving things. The
[03:23:31] NACEA here came out and said, why would you teach somebody how to apply it, turn it online? Like
[03:23:36] that don't you think that's kind of like a it's high in liability and it's neglectful? I'm like
[03:23:40] do you could build a rocket ship inside of your garage off a YouTube video? So I could think
[03:23:47] I think I could teach somebody how to stop the bleed with a technical, turn it get applied to their
[03:23:51] body to help them survive. And so I'm fascinated by it's my passion, obviously, but I think you're
[03:23:58] right. I think especially when it comes to leadership, there's a breakdown in our societies.
[03:24:04] With guys not willing to get off the bench and do anything for themselves, I was doing a podcast
[03:24:09] with Pete Blaber. It was a former CAD commander wrote the mission, the man in me, and worked
[03:24:16] just wrote part two of that, which is the common sense way. And one of the things he talks about
[03:24:21] is this idea of collaboration. And when you collaborate with somebody, when you have communication
[03:24:27] and you have reciprocation, then you create the environment of us wanting to learn from each other,
[03:24:33] but you also give people the confidence to stand up in their own communities and do something about it.
[03:24:39] I don't care if it's not their community. Like, yeah, you want to run for city council. That's great.
[03:24:43] You don't and you just want to stand up and get off your house for your family or even for yourself.
[03:24:48] You're fat, you're sloppy, you're lazy, and you can make a change inside yourself because you
[03:24:54] come to that realization. That's good. And for me, there's no revenue generated there.
[03:24:59] It could be a podcast. It could be one way to dissemination. That impact is priceless. It's worth
[03:25:04] everything in the world. So what are people going to do if they want to get in the game with you?
[03:25:12] So they go to, they go to, fieldcraftsurvival.com. That's it. I mean,
[03:25:17] fieldcraftsurvival, look, we're all over the map on fieldcraftsurvival. We'll get a podcast, we get the
[03:25:22] website. We can port you to theweedeprepair.com, which is the LMS or members dot americancontinus.com.
[03:25:31] The start point is start like in this experience, listening to the long-form versions for free
[03:25:38] from YouTube, from podcast, and start developing an understanding of what you want. And then,
[03:25:43] you know, it's all over the map on, look, on Instagram, fieldcraftsurvival. My personal's
[03:25:49] Mike.au.gov, but every day I'm living this. One thing I haven't detracted from is consistency.
[03:25:56] I might be making wrong business decisions. I mean, I might be jacked up in many ways,
[03:26:01] but one thing I could never be criticized for is consistency. So I wake up every single day with
[03:26:06] this on my mind. And in the last six years that I started this venture, I don't think I've had one
[03:26:10] day off. And that's okay. Because that my grind is this purpose. And, you know, selfishly, I don't
[03:26:16] know if this is a tactic. Maybe it's done when we're unaware of it. But I've built a thing around me
[03:26:24] that felt and feels like the team life that I had, the culture that I came from. And I get the
[03:26:30] feeling in it in here, and in your gym, and this, and the people that I've met, and in a similar
[03:26:37] experience, I'm doing the same thing on my end. And a parallel, parallel, but also synergistic
[03:26:43] universe. Is there any mistakes that you made from a business perspective that
[03:26:49] were close to catastrophic? Have you screwed up anything really bad? Or are they all just kind of
[03:26:53] little learners you go? Kind of learners you go. I think early on, I almost made a mistake early on
[03:27:00] where I was told in the diversification of all the things I was doing as too much. And I get that.
[03:27:05] If you look at me even today, I mean, there's a lot of things we got going on. But at the time,
[03:27:11] they all the verticals were spread so thin that nothing was getting traction. And so I was told,
[03:27:18] find one vertical, one thing, one kit, one training session, and double down on that. Create one
[03:27:24] little tiny vertical scale that you can make revenue from and then diversify. And I said,
[03:27:30] not, I can't do that. I said because this whole thing that's preparedness is very diversified
[03:27:34] in the first place. I can't teach mindset without teaching physical training. I can't teach physical
[03:27:39] training without an understanding of a mobility platform into your life. So we have to do everything
[03:27:45] it wants. And so doing that was challenging because it almost broke me. I'm literally it broke me.
[03:27:50] Like, I lived in my business with my girlfriend for four months and we literally lived in a warehouse
[03:27:57] for four months and it didn't have a shower. It had a pump shower that we can't with. That was
[03:28:03] our living circumstance. But you make those sacrifices in business and then all of a sudden everything
[03:28:08] scaled at once. And then you're like, oh, okay, so this is the place to be now. So now it's about tactics
[03:28:15] and you know, developing the right flow supply chain issues, all these things that everybody's
[03:28:21] dealing with in business. It's a it's a train wreck. But I wouldn't try it for the world.
[03:28:25] And where are you based on it? So right now we're in a heaversity Utah headquarters is there.
[03:28:31] We're standing up Kevin Owens, a former sniper team made him on who's unilaterally running
[03:28:36] a Philcraft NC. He's standing that up and then Rahal Martinez, my training director, has 20 subcontractors
[03:28:43] that teach all over the US. He's standing up in Arizona near Phoenix, north anthem, uh Arizona,
[03:28:50] which is north of Phoenix. So we're standing up these small little verticals, uh Evan Hayford,
[03:28:57] who's a buddy of mine, uh Owens Black rifle coffee has given me the opportunity to sell
[03:29:01] and display about the size of this table, Philcraft survival swag and gear that we sell for equipment.
[03:29:08] And that will be in every Black rifle coffee. It's in two right now. I'll be in four next week.
[03:29:13] Be it hopefully in a thousand when it competing with Starbucks. Um, but yeah, we're all over the map,
[03:29:18] man. That's freaking awesome. Well, hey, man, I think we've been going for, uh, I don't know,
[03:29:25] we're yet four hours yet. I don't know. Three and a half something like that. Um, I don't want
[03:29:30] to take up too much more years. I'm going to know you got a little, little, uh, plane to catch echo.
[03:29:35] Echo Charles, you got anything. I do not. Thanks for coming. Good to meet you. Nice meeting you,
[03:29:39] too, man. No questions from echo Charles. Not today. We covered it all. You, you,
[03:29:46] one podcast we were talking about living off the land. Yeah. And, um, you know, I was, uh, I was a
[03:29:52] radio man in my, in the last few days. So I was always travel light and, you know, carry like no food,
[03:29:57] just water batteries in the radio. And, and then we were talking about whatever was, uh,
[03:30:03] like we were talking about the Civil War and how those guys were just, they would live off the land.
[03:30:08] Right. And echo chimed in the fact that, you know, he had also, he could also live off the land.
[03:30:16] That exact. So, all right. He would say, and, you know, if he's going to LA for a couple of days,
[03:30:21] yeah, doesn't need to back a lot. Yeah. Because worst case scenario, live off the land. You
[03:30:25] don't, didn't bring a toothbrush. Brush cool. Roll into Walmart. Yeah. Roll into a wall greens.
[03:30:31] You get a toothbrush. That's what I'm talking about. Urban surprise. That's freaking
[03:30:34] a little bit surprising, man. I'm surprised you didn't ask about like what the best, you know,
[03:30:38] store was to get to the front of that city. Yes, but you see, yes, they're pretty consistent.
[03:30:43] Whatever Brett conceptually, it was the same thing. Same same. Instead of packing a big
[03:30:48] bag or whatever, like, you live off the land. Yeah. Urban sprawl. That's urban land.
[03:30:55] It's the same thing. Yeah. It's an ecosystem. It's an ecosystem. Let the environment provide.
[03:31:00] That's it. Right. Yeah. There you go. Right on. Sounds good.
[03:31:04] Mike, any closing thoughts? No, I just want to just take a second and just say thank you for the opportunity.
[03:31:10] I will, we'll say, just like I say on a lot of podcasts with guys of your caliber and your
[03:31:16] background that you're doing something that I wish a lot of guys with our background would do,
[03:31:21] which is get off the bench and take a stand and commit to this burden of responsibility. What you're
[03:31:28] doing is growing a business, but what you're also doing is impacting young people's lives and
[03:31:33] every walk of a life to do something with their lives. That's purpose. That's different than
[03:31:39] anything else that's a structure and business plan. This is an impact on culture. I think from, you know,
[03:31:46] it's far back as we can record every major battle that's been fought. Those men came from more
[03:31:54] in affected popular culture. Whether it was cut in, you know, P51 Mustangs, making hot rods,
[03:31:59] chopping hoarlies, having an extreme impact. There is a burden of responsibility of men like you and
[03:32:07] me that need to step up and accept that reality. The John Plaster, the John Strucker Myers,
[03:32:13] the world, are the ones who affected my life and me stepping up and doing something about it.
[03:32:18] I'm not talking about just military service. I'm talking about doing something impactful for your life.
[03:32:23] And this, the books, the business, that's the vertical and revenue. That's what scales the hierarchy
[03:32:32] and engros, but the impact it transcends across society. And without you, without your abilities
[03:32:40] to stay in it and stay committed, we wouldn't be affecting popular culture like we are.
[03:32:45] And I think you're leading the way in that way. I'm humbled to have been on this podcast and to
[03:32:50] have the opportunity to speak to your audience, but I just want to let you know that personally.
[03:32:55] It's a big deal. You're doing it. You did it in military service. To me, we come from similar lines.
[03:33:02] That's not the greatest impact. The greatest impact is what you're doing right now.
[03:33:05] It's all appreciate it. Well, thanks. I appreciate it. I'm not sure I'm all about you.
[03:33:10] I've made me out to be, but when I look at what you did in the past and freaking just talking about your deployments,
[03:33:17] I mean, not even, there's not even any words to describe. And I know that you sit there and think of the back of your head
[03:33:24] of like, you know guys that did 12 more deployments compared to your whatever five or six. And I think that's the feeling we all have all the time.
[03:33:32] And you even said it today, there's you found out I found out there's there's someone and not just someone,
[03:33:40] but there's a bunch of people way better than we are at that job and God bless them for going out there and getting after it.
[03:33:47] And that being said, what you did to hold the line, what you did to carry the torch,
[03:33:53] appreciate it. And then back at you once again, what you're doing right now, you know, I think what you're doing right now is
[03:33:59] going to have a huge impact and is having huge impact, getting people's mindset straight.
[03:34:07] In a time when mindsets are all over the map, seeing you do that, that's impressive.
[03:34:15] And I hope you keep doing it, brother. Thanks, brother. We'll do right on.
[03:34:22] And with that Mike Glover has left the building,
[03:34:25] I appreciate my coming on.
[03:34:31] Freaking great story.
[03:34:34] Bottom incredible stuff and what you're doing right now is awesome.
[03:34:40] Talking about preparedness, talking about being ready.
[03:34:46] Seems like we should start fundamentally. There's one area we can start to be ready.
[03:34:50] Today, echo Charles, what do you think? There's always ways to be ready, be more ready.
[03:34:59] I think that self evaluation part was kind of critical. I mean, it wasn't surprising.
[03:35:06] But it was a good reminder. It's like one of those answers that lies right below the surface
[03:35:12] that you already know is there, but it's not always revealed. It's self-reflect.
[03:35:17] Evaluate where are we? You would think that's obvious, but it's not.
[03:35:21] It's not a lot of people go through life without evaluation,
[03:35:23] evaluating where they're at, where they can improve, what they can do better.
[03:35:26] Yeah, it's true. And I'd say this before, where it's in a way, depends on how you look at it.
[03:35:32] It's a good problem to have. It means a lot of our problems are solved.
[03:35:35] You know, if you're not worried about this or that happening, that just means that
[03:35:40] it's not happening very often. You know, kind of a thing, which is a good thing.
[03:35:43] Solved problems tends to be a good thing. Tens do. Okay. Anyway, so we got to be careful about
[03:35:53] that kind of stuff. We do want to keep ourselves ready, strong, healthy. You won't have to
[03:36:00] exercise strength every single day, aside from in the gym. It seems to say, like you doing 20
[03:36:10] reps squats. Right? Like the results, the reason you do that. That reason is not going to be
[03:36:18] demonstrated, displayed, put into play every single day in real life. It's not going to.
[03:36:25] I guess maybe conceptually it might, but no at all. But there's a bigger purpose here.
[03:36:31] It's the same. It's to stay ready, realistically as ready as you possibly can.
[03:36:37] And all these different elements. So while we're on this path of readiness, capability, health,
[03:36:44] mental and physical, we might need some supplementation. Good news is,
[03:36:49] Jocco has supplementation called Jocco Fuel. So let's start with discipline. Go. RTD
[03:36:56] cans. It is the new, the new era of energy drinks. Actual energy drinks. Yeah, my
[03:37:04] glory said something real simple, but real true. I like it. I like that it's healthy.
[03:37:11] You don't have to worry about poisoning yourself anymore. I'm paraphrasing that last
[03:37:16] part. But it's true though. And I said before too, where yeah, you look, sometimes I'm going to drink
[03:37:21] two of those in a row. Sometimes three. I did drink two of them just now. Yes, so you don't have
[03:37:27] to, there's no back end price anymore. It's like, oh wait, I'm actually technically, I'm not worried
[03:37:32] about becoming a type two diabetic this afternoon. Correct. I didn't just drink 72 grams of sugar
[03:37:38] or whatever. No, I had monk fruit, which is technically good for you. Yeah, that was a good point.
[03:37:44] You made this off air, by the way. Where you're like, yeah, there's five calories in the
[03:37:50] new ones, there's 15 calories. Because it comes from food. Yeah. The sweetener comes from food. Not some
[03:37:56] chemical that shouldn't be in your body. Yeah. They can't provide any kind of calories.
[03:38:00] Between five and ten calories per can. Why is that? Like you just said, because it's not chemicals.
[03:38:07] You know what has zero calories? Calories? A chemical. That's what has zero calories. What has
[03:38:13] some calories? Monk fruit has some calories. Yeah. Five. Yeah, so it's one of those deals, man. Like I said,
[03:38:21] the new era of energy drinks. You can drink some energy drinks. There's your energy drink.
[03:38:24] Great there. On the path 100%. Two. That's not like it's like, well, you know, preserve
[03:38:29] it. It's not partial path. 100% on the path. 100%. No deacion. So yes, you can get these
[03:38:35] in it. There's new flavors out by the way. You're going to have to check them out yourself.
[03:38:40] Very impactful, exciting flavors. As far as flavors go. You know, you can get them at
[03:38:45] wall wall if you're in the area that you have wall wall. You can get them at a vitamin shop.
[03:38:51] By the way, talking about flavors, what I find interesting is some families of beverages. They kind
[03:38:58] of all taste the same. They might have a different label on it or a different name. This stuff
[03:39:06] tastes legitimately different. Like you might have one or be like, this is the best thing I've ever
[03:39:11] tasted. You might have an other one, not like it. Try a different one. Yeah. Because there's definitely
[03:39:16] more variation in flavor. With these flavors, then there is with a normal company, a normal drink.
[03:39:24] Who's just like, look, they know what the flavor profile is to get people addicted. So they put
[03:39:29] a bunch of sugar in there, name it something and cool. They're moving forward. We're not doing that.
[03:39:34] We're giving you legit flavor profiles with different tastes. It's a good point for your mind.
[03:39:39] Open. Also, you can get them at originusa.com. Also, as far as supplementation goes,
[03:39:46] we have stuff for your joints, super-cryl oils and joint warfare. Also for your immunity, vitamin D3
[03:39:52] and cold ore. Also, if you need additional protein, if you want additional protein. Or if you want
[03:39:59] dessert. And the ore and ore from dessert. Boom. But I had one last night. Not to go to
[03:40:06] people do it. The peanut butter? No, yeah. One peanut butter. That's a win. A total win. And it's
[03:40:14] not like I was like, let me just choose the pair. I just grabbed anyone and it happened to be that.
[03:40:18] Yeah. So I'm like cool. I went kind of hard though. I don't recommend this all the time. I put
[03:40:24] some chocolate chips in there. On accident put too many. Not that way too many, but too many. And then
[03:40:30] banana. This kind of disqualifies everything you're saying. A little bit. You can't just add chocolate
[03:40:34] chips. It always tastes really good. You added chocolate chips, bro. But it was like almost too sweet.
[03:40:43] I think because of the additional chocolate chips. Yeah. I pondered the whole thing. Okay. You're
[03:40:49] still very, very good. You know what you do? You know those the dark chocolate chunks. You can
[03:40:56] buy dark chocolate. Yeah. Whatever percentage put that in there. That would have been perfect even
[03:41:00] for accidentally put too much. Anyway, there's other flavors as well. So don't, you know, don't
[03:41:07] slack on that either way, whatever flavor you like, milk, additional protein, another clean deal.
[03:41:13] It's not like some sugar filled deal. It is once you put freaking chocolate chips in it. You know,
[03:41:19] it's going to depend on the level of, uh, it's really good to say. It's like a dark chocolate.
[03:41:23] It's like a turning the Pete Roberts with the vegan chip cubes under your tongue. It was just one of
[03:41:28] those things. You know, it happened some time. But I don't put chocolate chips in there. It's freaking
[03:41:32] delicious. Yeah. Totally does. So there you go. Get some milk. Get some, get what you need. Yeah.
[03:41:39] Dark filled.com. And by the way, this is important. It's important. Oh, just this is important.

[03:43:07] disciplining, cost freedom. Good. When things are going bad, this is always some good. It
[03:43:13] comes from it. Iconic video. Words from the man right here. Then the last you want to represent that.
[03:43:19] That's where you can get the shirts on Jocco's store. So, in this video, that's iconic,
[03:43:23] or is it the words? I don't know. I don't know. I had any value-weighted kind of things. Like both,
[03:43:27] I guess, technically, but you're saying you made an iconic video is what I'm here. Either way.
[03:43:34] Good job. Either way. We have a subscription situation as well. For shirts.
[03:43:38] Designs a little bit different. Iconic design. That's a subject for debate and thank,

[03:45:34] Because you always see my little bit frustrated. You always see my little bit frustrated.
[03:45:40] You kind of, the good thing I'll say, your humble enough to be like, you do the shot.
[03:45:45] Whatever the adjustment is. But then I feel like it. I feel like you have a hard, I think those
[03:45:52] nights you don't sleep as good as you do. If you come in and you got the shots. Well,
[03:45:56] I'll wise man once told me. And when I say once, I mean plenty of times that as a leader,

[03:46:15] sounds like a good shot. We'll do that shot. I like it a lot. That's good. Even if it's an 80%
[03:46:20] solution. Even if the shots in a person's solution. What I'm asking you, so from a leadership,
[03:46:24] giving you an A minus. But what I'm saying is when you go home at night and the little demon
[03:46:33] start to knock at the door and you wonder why the assistant director had to come up with that shot.
[03:46:40] Yeah, had to say, hey, let me give you a little help.
[03:46:45] Sir, it looks like what happens. You did? It makes me happy.

[03:46:55] You want to know why you got the A minus? Because I can see it in your face.
[03:46:59] I can see it in your face. I can see the frustration when you don't come up with the shot.
[03:47:04] When it's when you have to take advice from the AD, when you have to take advice from the AD,
[03:47:11] yep, that's when I realize it. Yeah, it'll frustrated. I can see it in your face. I can see it in your eyes.
[03:47:16] I can kind of feel it, too. Yeah, well, I'll give you credit. It's still an A.
[03:47:20] Because you still do your best to get the good shot. I haven't had you sabotage a shot yet
[03:47:25] and said, yeah, you know, it actually doesn't work. But I can see that it's frustrating.
