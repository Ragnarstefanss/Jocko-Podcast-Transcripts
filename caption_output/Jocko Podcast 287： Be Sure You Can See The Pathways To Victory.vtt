00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.96
This is Jockel Pondcast number 287.

2
00:00:02.96 --> 00:00:05.40
Bethesios and me.

3
00:00:05.40 --> 00:00:06.40
Jockel willing.

4
00:00:06.40 --> 00:00:07.40
Good evening, Eco.

5
00:00:07.40 --> 00:00:08.40
Good evening.

6
00:00:08.40 --> 00:00:11.40
And joining us again is Dave Verk, good evening, Dave.

7
00:00:11.40 --> 00:00:12.40
Good evening.

8
00:00:12.40 --> 00:00:18.36
So listen, if you've been tracking, we have been talking about BH LaDale Hart.

9
00:00:18.36 --> 00:00:20.72
We've been talking about his strategy, the indirect approach.

10
00:00:20.72 --> 00:00:23.44
We've been covering his book, the strategy of indirect approach.

11
00:00:23.44 --> 00:00:27.44
Then we rolled into his book, which is just called strategy.

12
00:00:27.44 --> 00:00:37.28
This stuff is, it's just, it's so important to wrap your head around this stuff.

13
00:00:37.28 --> 00:00:41.04
It's a lot of it is counterintuitive when you hear it.

14
00:00:41.04 --> 00:00:44.000
It's counterintuitive when you hear it.

15
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.96
It's sometimes even more counterintuitive when you try and do it.

16
00:00:49.96 --> 00:00:57.40
And if you understand it and you do it and you execute it, it is a game changer in

17
00:00:57.40 --> 00:01:02.04
the way you execute and it's also a game changer in the way you think.

18
00:01:02.04 --> 00:01:08.52
So if you haven't yet listened to 285 and 286, to learn a little bit about BH LaDale

19
00:01:08.52 --> 00:01:18.16
Hart, who is a veteran soldier, a British soldier, World War I, wounded multiple times,

20
00:01:18.16 --> 00:01:23.28
sent back from the front multiple times, sent back to the front multiple times, fought

21
00:01:23.28 --> 00:01:24.60
in the battle of a song.

22
00:01:24.60 --> 00:01:31.60
I mean, just almost as whole the Italian wiped out, gravely wounded with Gai, he was gasped.

23
00:01:31.60 --> 00:01:36.04
I mean, been to how I'm back quite literally.

24
00:01:36.04 --> 00:01:39.16
There's not too many people we can talk about, obviously, that fought in the battle of

25
00:01:39.16 --> 00:01:41.16
a song.

26
00:01:41.16 --> 00:01:46.88
On the last podcast, I was talking about the fact that he, you know, we throw the words

27
00:01:46.88 --> 00:01:49.64
battle tested around, like all this battle tested.

28
00:01:49.64 --> 00:01:55.48
How about battle tested in what's actually the worst battle ever?

29
00:01:55.48 --> 00:02:00.56
That's where he kind of started to think about the strategy and tactics that we're

30
00:02:00.56 --> 00:02:01.56
being used.

31
00:02:01.56 --> 00:02:08.08
This is what sort of when he talks about the indirect approach is the antithesis to what

32
00:02:08.08 --> 00:02:10.12
World War I was.

33
00:02:10.12 --> 00:02:18.56
So if you haven't yet, go back and listen to 285 and 286 and then join us right now with

34
00:02:18.56 --> 00:02:22.48
287 Dave and the intro remarks.

35
00:02:22.48 --> 00:02:24.48
No, you were writing down there.

36
00:02:24.48 --> 00:02:31.28
Yeah, I was thinking about the last podcast that we did and just where he's coming from

37
00:02:31.28 --> 00:02:36.76
and I'm actually super stoked to get to these concluding, these, the end of this section

38
00:02:36.76 --> 00:02:39.84
or this, this trilogy.

39
00:02:39.84 --> 00:02:46.60
Because I was saying this last time I think this is all new.

40
00:02:46.60 --> 00:02:52.60
Like I get to hear this in real time and the sort of the chronology of your very first

41
00:02:52.60 --> 00:02:56.08
introduction from 285 was like, hey, a little bit of the background of heart, but I didn't

42
00:02:56.08 --> 00:03:02.40
really, I didn't really sink in as you were saying it of what you just said, like what

43
00:03:02.40 --> 00:03:10.12
he went through and you said it left a mark on him, but I did not, I did not appreciate

44
00:03:10.12 --> 00:03:21.04
the depth of that mark and what it compelled him to do to try to course correct this massive,

45
00:03:21.04 --> 00:03:24.60
this massive mistake that he had to endure in witness.

46
00:03:24.60 --> 00:03:31.64
So I have, I think I've been able to understand what he's been saying a lot better as you've

47
00:03:31.64 --> 00:03:35.04
been reading it thinking about where he came from.

48
00:03:35.04 --> 00:03:39.36
You know what I should have done is I should have gone, well first of all, I should

49
00:03:39.36 --> 00:03:44.84
have given a little bit more detail there, but I also should have gone back, there's so

50
00:03:44.84 --> 00:03:50.000
many references to be a Tula del Hart in so many manuals, it's ridiculous.

51
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.80
And I should have pulled some of those up and said, oh, when we did this Marine Corps manual,

52
00:03:54.80 --> 00:03:57.92
when I did this Army manual, here's where this come from, here's the roots of this statement

53
00:03:57.92 --> 00:04:01.68
because they, they cite, they cite him.

54
00:04:01.68 --> 00:04:08.88
So I guess part of it is, there's some other podcast that I have in the hopper in my mind

55
00:04:08.88 --> 00:04:15.84
that I want to do that I really can't do without people understanding this idea of the strategy

56
00:04:15.84 --> 00:04:16.84
of the indirect approach.

57
00:04:16.84 --> 00:04:18.84
I just can't, I can't go forward.

58
00:04:18.84 --> 00:04:20.48
It's like I had to do this.

59
00:04:20.48 --> 00:04:29.84
So I will go back, I'm sure, and do some more historical context around his life and

60
00:04:29.84 --> 00:04:32.000
what he went through.

61
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.68
But I also, man, I wanted to get this stuff out there.

62
00:04:34.68 --> 00:04:38.16
You know, it's like a prioritize next Q drill to be quite frank with you.

63
00:04:38.16 --> 00:04:46.80
I would, I wanted to get people to understand this and see how beneficial it can be for their

64
00:04:46.80 --> 00:04:53.52
thought process because it's been so beneficial for my, for the last 30 years of my life,

65
00:04:53.52 --> 00:04:59.32
maybe 20, 25 years of my life where I realized, wait a second.

66
00:04:59.32 --> 00:05:00.84
Going direct isn't always the best thing.

67
00:05:00.84 --> 00:05:05.000
In fact, the more I figured that out, the more I was like, oh, going direct is usually

68
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.04
not the best thing.

69
00:05:07.04 --> 00:05:10.12
Quite often the indirect approach is correct.

70
00:05:10.12 --> 00:05:13.48
It's the correct thing in Jiu-Jitsu, it's the correct thing in battlefield, it's

71
00:05:13.48 --> 00:05:18.36
a correct thing as a leader, it's a correct thing interacting with other human beings.

72
00:05:18.36 --> 00:05:22.36
So that's kind of where we are, how we got here.

73
00:05:22.36 --> 00:05:26.78
You know, a lot, a lot, that's the weird thing about having a podcast and doing things via

74
00:05:26.78 --> 00:05:33.64
podcast is part of the benefit as of it is the immediacy of it.

75
00:05:33.64 --> 00:05:35.36
Like, there's not.

76
00:05:35.36 --> 00:05:38.56
You know, if you write a book, if I was to write a book about this stuff, it would take

77
00:05:38.56 --> 00:05:40.84
three years, now two years.

78
00:05:40.84 --> 00:05:43.68
Like if I just was gave up everything else in set, I'm going to write a book about this,

79
00:05:43.68 --> 00:05:47.96
it would take two years to do, to get it, to get it written, to get it published, to get

80
00:05:47.96 --> 00:05:53.28
it, ever started to get it written, edited, I go, there's so much lag time to do a podcast,

81
00:05:53.28 --> 00:05:57.12
it's like, cool, you know what, here's a book, I've had this book for a long time,

82
00:05:57.12 --> 00:06:00.24
I actually gave you my extra copy of this book.

83
00:06:00.24 --> 00:06:05.04
So, to put to be able to say, you know what, I want to get this done now is the time

84
00:06:05.04 --> 00:06:06.84
to boom, you can go and execute it.

85
00:06:06.84 --> 00:06:12.28
And what you sacrifice is you sacrifice some perfection, right?

86
00:06:12.28 --> 00:06:17.08
You sacrifice some perfection because head, I sat there and thought about the best way to do

87
00:06:17.08 --> 00:06:21.08
this, maybe I would say, you know what I need to, I need an entire episode about the

88
00:06:21.08 --> 00:06:26.08
battle of the song, I need an entire episode about what gassing does to you, I need to

89
00:06:26.08 --> 00:06:31.08
do an episode about his battalion with the Yorkshire Light Regiment, right, and talk about

90
00:06:31.08 --> 00:06:32.08
exactly who is in it.

91
00:06:32.08 --> 00:06:36.04
There's a whole bunch of different things I could have done and it's not, and that's

92
00:06:36.04 --> 00:06:39.12
there, that would have made this better.

93
00:06:39.12 --> 00:06:44.64
And that's one of the, one of the compromises that you make in moving forward and executing,

94
00:06:44.64 --> 00:06:49.16
like, you know what, I'm looking back now, hindsight 2020, cool, should have done that,

95
00:06:49.16 --> 00:06:51.40
didn't do it, we'll do it in the future.

96
00:06:51.40 --> 00:06:53.68
So, where it goes?

97
00:06:53.68 --> 00:06:59.000
Yeah, and even for me, as I, as I contemplate what I'm trying to say, you talk about, you

98
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.84
sacrifice the perfection of your sacrifice, even the way I'm trying to say what I'm thinking

99
00:07:03.84 --> 00:07:07.96
is not exactly right, it's not how I would say it if I spent time to sit down with a

100
00:07:07.96 --> 00:07:12.72
pen and paper and write out what I'm thinking or what I'm thinking about or the references

101
00:07:12.72 --> 00:07:19.96
I'm making in my head, but to be able to sort of reflect in real time as you're reading this,

102
00:07:19.96 --> 00:07:26.04
as inaccurate or not as eloquent as I'd like it to be, it's a really cool exercise, as

103
00:07:26.04 --> 00:07:34.000
they listener of leadership to think about hearing what he's saying, contemplating the

104
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:42.40
frame of reference he had and how it applies to our world, which is, you don't need

105
00:07:42.40 --> 00:07:49.24
to be in war ever one to recognize how absolutely directly affected you can be by thinking

106
00:07:49.24 --> 00:07:52.40
about what he's saying and applying it to your day-to-day life and how you interact with

107
00:07:52.40 --> 00:07:58.000
people, which is kind of crazy to think about it, but it's also true.

108
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.20
And I guess if there's a problem with any of this, if there's a problem with any of the

109
00:08:02.20 --> 00:08:07.44
things that you're saying is that there's nothing sexy about the indirect approach,

110
00:08:07.44 --> 00:08:10.76
it doesn't like, it doesn't play well.

111
00:08:10.76 --> 00:08:15.12
Like, you're not, I'm going to get up and give a speech about the indirect approach.

112
00:08:15.12 --> 00:08:17.72
Men, we're going to subordinate our egos today.

113
00:08:17.72 --> 00:08:24.48
It doesn't, the language doesn't work. It doesn't give you that satisfaction that people

114
00:08:24.48 --> 00:08:28.76
want with cross-wits the entotal war.

115
00:08:28.76 --> 00:08:35.28
But what's crazy is how obvious it is to think about how it helps you achieve the ultimate

116
00:08:35.28 --> 00:08:38.24
objective, which is winning the war.

117
00:08:38.24 --> 00:08:46.36
And how much more satisfying that is than just winning a battle, or than losing the war.

118
00:08:46.36 --> 00:08:53.28
So for whatever it lacks in the excitement of the language of, we're going to destroy every

119
00:08:53.28 --> 00:08:59.24
single aspect of our enemy down to the ground.

120
00:08:59.24 --> 00:09:02.88
This actually is the tool that you need to be successful in anything.

121
00:09:02.88 --> 00:09:03.88
This is how you actually win.

122
00:09:03.88 --> 00:09:06.60
Is that you win?

123
00:09:06.60 --> 00:09:17.32
That's very counter-cultural.

124
00:09:17.32 --> 00:09:19.08
Like you said, it doesn't sell well.

125
00:09:19.08 --> 00:09:23.24
You can imagine selling well, Jackson standing up and saying, all right, guys, the enemy

126
00:09:23.24 --> 00:09:25.000
is half mile down there.

127
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.40
We are going to take the fight to them and people get fired up as opposed to saying, hey,

128
00:09:29.40 --> 00:09:30.92
the enemy is right down there.

129
00:09:30.92 --> 00:09:35.96
And we're going to walk 14 miles right now to go and hit him for where he doesn't really

130
00:09:35.96 --> 00:09:44.24
expect it because we don't want to have to face his really, we don't want to have to face

131
00:09:44.24 --> 00:09:45.24
his strength.

132
00:09:45.24 --> 00:09:46.24
We're a little scared to do that.

133
00:09:46.24 --> 00:09:49.40
So we're going to walk around and kind of soccer punch him.

134
00:09:49.40 --> 00:09:50.40
You guys with me?

135
00:09:50.40 --> 00:09:51.40
Right?

136
00:09:51.40 --> 00:09:57.12
It's just like, it's really, as opposed to forward into the breach, right?

137
00:09:57.12 --> 00:09:58.44
No, not really.

138
00:09:58.44 --> 00:10:04.20
We're going to sneak around and soccer punch somebody who's with me.

139
00:10:04.20 --> 00:10:07.20
But it's how you win.

140
00:10:07.20 --> 00:10:13.000
So let's jump back into it.

141
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.60
Further revision of theory and trying to revise any theory and readjust it for better balance.

142
00:10:18.60 --> 00:10:20.16
Oh, isn't that interesting?

143
00:10:20.16 --> 00:10:24.16
We're talking about balance because this is everything is a dichotomy.

144
00:10:24.16 --> 00:10:29.56
Again, I owe royalties to the LaDale Heart family.

145
00:10:29.56 --> 00:10:33.40
It is a help to have a background of study in the subject.

146
00:10:33.40 --> 00:10:38.56
As long as one is willing to modify one's conclusions.

147
00:10:38.56 --> 00:10:39.68
Not interesting.

148
00:10:39.68 --> 00:10:43.96
We have to actually be willing to modify our conclusions.

149
00:10:43.96 --> 00:10:47.40
Change our mind.

150
00:10:47.40 --> 00:10:48.40
I was.

151
00:10:48.40 --> 00:10:54.80
So far as I know, the first student of war after 1914 to 1918 to make a re-examination of the

152
00:10:54.80 --> 00:10:59.44
prevailing doctrines derived from cross-rits about the objective in war.

153
00:10:59.44 --> 00:11:04.24
We're calling it in question in number of articles in the military journals.

154
00:11:04.24 --> 00:11:11.32
I was dealt with it more fully in Paris or the future of war 1925.

155
00:11:11.32 --> 00:11:16.44
This little book began with a criticism of the way that the Orthodox aim, quote, the destruction

156
00:11:16.44 --> 00:11:21.32
of the enemy's main forces on the battlefield, and quote, had been pursued in World War

157
00:11:21.32 --> 00:11:27.08
One pointing out its indesisive and exhausting results.

158
00:11:27.08 --> 00:11:28.40
To your point earlier.

159
00:11:28.40 --> 00:11:31.72
Hey, we want to go and confront the enemy head on.

160
00:11:31.72 --> 00:11:32.72
Cool.

161
00:11:32.72 --> 00:11:39.28
We did that for three years, at four years, and we had not only, we had indesisive and exhausting

162
00:11:39.28 --> 00:11:40.28
results.

163
00:11:40.28 --> 00:11:41.28
We were exhausting.

164
00:11:41.28 --> 00:11:43.28
We didn't get anywhere.

165
00:11:43.28 --> 00:11:46.32
God, what a freaking sin.

166
00:11:46.32 --> 00:11:53.40
What a sin to expend all those lives and be exhausted from it and have no real decisive

167
00:11:53.40 --> 00:11:56.64
victory.

168
00:11:56.64 --> 00:11:57.64
Continuing.

169
00:11:57.64 --> 00:12:03.52
I want to argue that the advantages of the moral objective showing how armored forces

170
00:12:03.52 --> 00:12:07.64
might deliver decisive blow against the Achilles heel of the enemy army, which is the

171
00:12:07.64 --> 00:12:12.92
communication and command centers, which form its nerve system and two, how air forces

172
00:12:12.92 --> 00:12:18.28
besides cooperating in this strategic action might also strike with the decisive effect

173
00:12:18.28 --> 00:12:25.28
direct at a nation's nerve system, and that is its static civil centers of industry.

174
00:12:25.28 --> 00:12:29.72
So he's the first guy that said, hey, well, we did in World War One sucked and we shouldn't

175
00:12:29.72 --> 00:12:30.72
do it again.

176
00:12:30.72 --> 00:12:38.56
How about we use freaking tanks and aircraft to pierce the enemy and cut off their communication

177
00:12:38.56 --> 00:12:43.60
and ruin their industries?

178
00:12:43.60 --> 00:12:44.60
Continuing.

179
00:12:44.60 --> 00:12:48.92
The general staff prescribed the book for the study of the officers of the first experimental

180
00:12:48.92 --> 00:12:51.68
mechanized force when this was formed two years later.

181
00:12:51.68 --> 00:12:55.68
The air staff less surprisingly made still fuller use of it.

182
00:12:55.68 --> 00:13:02.08
There was then a lack of textbooks on air strategy and it fitted the developing trend

183
00:13:02.08 --> 00:13:04.56
of their views on the subject.

184
00:13:04.56 --> 00:13:09.92
The chief of staff, the chief of the air staff distributed copies to his fellow chiefs

185
00:13:09.92 --> 00:13:12.12
of staffs.

186
00:13:12.12 --> 00:13:17.72
What I have said now is thus a revision after prolonged reflection of what I wrote a

187
00:13:17.72 --> 00:13:23.20
quarter century ago and an avowl of error over part of the thesis.

188
00:13:23.20 --> 00:13:27.12
So he's taking ownership of something that he screwed up.

189
00:13:27.12 --> 00:13:34.64
It shows how in correcting the balance one is apt to tilt too far the other way.

190
00:13:34.64 --> 00:13:37.04
This is something I call classic team guy over correction.

191
00:13:37.04 --> 00:13:39.76
I would make a, I'd go and guys would be coming through my training.

192
00:13:39.76 --> 00:13:40.76
They'd make a mistake.

193
00:13:40.76 --> 00:13:41.76
Hey, you're micro managing.

194
00:13:41.76 --> 00:13:45.88
Also, they let people do whatever they want or the opposite.

195
00:13:45.88 --> 00:13:49.08
Using the balance it one is apt to tilt too far the other way.

196
00:13:49.08 --> 00:13:53.76
T.E. Lawrence observed in a letter he wrote me in 1928.

197
00:13:53.76 --> 00:13:54.76
His Lawrence of Arabia.

198
00:13:54.76 --> 00:14:00.80
This is a guy that found the error, revolt in the Sinai and Palestinian campaign in World

199
00:14:00.80 --> 00:14:01.80
War.

200
00:14:01.80 --> 00:14:04.36
One, I mean, this guy is a legendary.

201
00:14:04.36 --> 00:14:12.000
And Lawrence of Arabia says quote, the logical system of crosswitz is too complete.

202
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.92
What an opening line.

203
00:14:13.92 --> 00:14:17.36
A logical system of crosswitz is too complete.

204
00:14:17.36 --> 00:14:23.36
It leads a stray his disciples, those of them at least, who would rather fight with their

205
00:14:23.36 --> 00:14:28.24
arms than with their legs.

206
00:14:28.24 --> 00:14:32.40
What a freaking statement to open up a letter.

207
00:14:32.40 --> 00:14:35.92
Rather fight with their arms and with their legs.

208
00:14:35.92 --> 00:14:38.88
What an epic statement.

209
00:14:38.88 --> 00:14:44.16
It's kind of a kind of a goes in with my discipline.

210
00:14:44.16 --> 00:14:45.16
He goes free to them fieldmen.

211
00:14:45.16 --> 00:14:48.04
He'll talk in about, you know, oh, you want to fight?

212
00:14:48.04 --> 00:14:49.44
You want to know self defense?

213
00:14:49.44 --> 00:14:50.44
Cool.

214
00:14:50.44 --> 00:14:51.44
You want to punch me?

215
00:14:51.44 --> 00:14:52.44
I want to run away.

216
00:14:52.44 --> 00:14:53.44
You want to kick me, cool.

217
00:14:53.44 --> 00:14:54.44
I'm going to run away.

218
00:14:54.44 --> 00:14:59.32
I'm going to fight with my legs, not with my arms.

219
00:14:59.32 --> 00:15:04.48
Continuing on, you at present are trying with very little help from those whose businesses

220
00:15:04.48 --> 00:15:09.16
they think upon their profession to put the balance straight after the orgy of the last

221
00:15:09.16 --> 00:15:11.16
war.

222
00:15:11.16 --> 00:15:16.68
When you succeed about 1945, these are like little jokes he's making because he's writing

223
00:15:16.68 --> 00:15:17.88
this in 1928.

224
00:15:17.88 --> 00:15:24.40
When you succeed about 1945, your sheep will pass your bounds of discretion and have

225
00:15:24.40 --> 00:15:32.48
to be shivied back to some later strategist, back and forward we go and quote.

226
00:15:32.48 --> 00:15:40.20
In 1925, I myself went too far and arguing the advantages of the air stroke at civil objectives.

227
00:15:40.20 --> 00:15:44.52
Though I did qualify this by emphasizing the importance of executing it in such a way

228
00:15:44.52 --> 00:15:49.76
as to inflict the least possible permanent injury for the enemy of today is the customer

229
00:15:49.76 --> 00:15:55.76
of the morrow and the ally of the future.

230
00:15:55.76 --> 00:15:57.40
Who would think that that's possible?

231
00:15:57.40 --> 00:15:59.72
Who would think that Germany would become our ally?

232
00:15:59.72 --> 00:16:00.56
Right?

233
00:16:00.56 --> 00:16:07.24
Who would think that the Japanese would rebuild them to a point of economic power where

234
00:16:07.24 --> 00:16:10.12
we're in total cooperation with totally?

235
00:16:10.12 --> 00:16:16.12
My belief then was that a decisive era tack would inflict less total damage in constitute

236
00:16:16.12 --> 00:16:22.12
less of a drain on the defeated countries recuperative power than a prolonged war of the

237
00:16:22.12 --> 00:16:23.28
existing type.

238
00:16:23.28 --> 00:16:26.88
In further study, I came to realize that an era tack on industrial centers was unlikely

239
00:16:26.88 --> 00:16:32.000
to have an immediate decisive effect and more likely to produce another prolonged war of

240
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.96
a tritian in fresh form with perhaps less killing but more devastation than from 1918,

241
00:16:37.96 --> 00:16:41.80
1918, 1914 to 1918.

242
00:16:41.80 --> 00:16:43.08
World war.

243
00:16:43.08 --> 00:16:49.48
But when one began to point this out, one soon found that the air staff was far less receptive

244
00:16:49.48 --> 00:16:52.68
to the revised conclusion than to the original conclusion.

245
00:16:52.68 --> 00:16:58.36
They continued to cherish faith in a speedy decision and when war experienced compelled them

246
00:16:58.36 --> 00:17:03.40
to relinquish it, they pinned their faith instead on industrial attrition as fervently

247
00:17:03.40 --> 00:17:10.24
as the general staff of the last word done to manpower attrition.

248
00:17:10.24 --> 00:17:12.44
We're not learning lessons.

249
00:17:12.44 --> 00:17:15.88
God.

250
00:17:15.88 --> 00:17:25.28
Elective egos at play just not learning lessons.

251
00:17:25.28 --> 00:17:29.32
A lot of this is why, like I said, I've said a couple of times now that this book and

252
00:17:29.32 --> 00:17:35.96
these strategy is a setup for me for another series of podcasts that I want to do and

253
00:17:35.96 --> 00:17:41.32
it's all going to come so become so clear.

254
00:17:41.32 --> 00:17:46.56
Nevertheless, a realization of the drawbacks and evils of taking the civil fabric as the

255
00:17:46.56 --> 00:17:51.20
objective does not mean the restoration of battle in the own sense of the objective.

256
00:17:51.20 --> 00:17:56.48
The drawbacks of that cause wouldn't cause witsy in formula where amply shown in World

257
00:17:56.48 --> 00:17:57.48
War 1.

258
00:17:57.48 --> 00:18:03.20
In contrast, World War 2 demonstrated the advantage of new potentialities of indirect or

259
00:18:03.20 --> 00:18:09.84
strategic action against a military objective, amply confirming what had been forecast

260
00:18:09.84 --> 00:18:15.28
in that respect.

261
00:18:15.28 --> 00:18:16.84
Is he saying, yeah, I told you so?

262
00:18:16.84 --> 00:18:17.84
Yes, he is.

263
00:18:17.84 --> 00:18:19.40
He's saying, I told you so.

264
00:18:19.40 --> 00:18:25.000
I told you that these things, I told you that this error that this mechanized fast moving

265
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.72
elements could change the face of war, especially when coupled with air power.

266
00:18:30.72 --> 00:18:34.48
I told you so.

267
00:18:34.48 --> 00:18:39.000
Even in the past, such action had been effectively exploited by some of the great captains

268
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.88
despite the limitations of their instruments, but now with the help of new instruments,

269
00:18:43.88 --> 00:18:49.60
the airplane, the tank, it proved still more decisive despite the increased strength of

270
00:18:49.60 --> 00:18:51.64
tactical resistance.

271
00:18:51.64 --> 00:18:57.48
The new mobility produced a flexibility in varying the direction of thrust and threat which

272
00:18:57.48 --> 00:19:00.48
disarmed such resistance.

273
00:19:00.48 --> 00:19:03.32
And that's what we talked about in the last podcast.

274
00:19:03.32 --> 00:19:08.32
France, Poland, the Balkans, just disarmed resistance.

275
00:19:08.32 --> 00:19:14.76
The time has come for a fresh revision of the doctrine of the objective or military aim

276
00:19:14.76 --> 00:19:17.92
and light of recent experience and present conditions.

277
00:19:17.92 --> 00:19:23.12
It is much to be desired that it should be undertaken on combined service basis to produce

278
00:19:23.12 --> 00:19:30.24
an agreed solution for there is a dangerous discordance of doctrines at presence.

279
00:19:30.24 --> 00:19:33.92
The outlines of a revised theory fitted to present conditions and knowledge have emerged.

280
00:19:33.92 --> 00:19:42.32
I hope in course of this discussion of the subject, the key idea is strategic operation

281
00:19:42.32 --> 00:19:50.44
rather than battle and old term that has outlived its suitability and utility.

282
00:19:50.44 --> 00:19:52.88
So get rid of this whole idea of battle.

283
00:19:52.88 --> 00:19:59.76
Battles may still occur, but should not be regarded as the aim itself to repeat an earlier

284
00:19:59.76 --> 00:20:04.24
conclusion that was strikingly vindicated in World War II.

285
00:20:04.24 --> 00:20:11.88
The true aim is not so much to seek battle as to seek a strategic situation, so advantageous

286
00:20:11.88 --> 00:20:16.72
that does not of itself produce the decision that if it does not of itself produce the

287
00:20:16.72 --> 00:20:21.44
decision, its continuation by a battle is sure to achieve this.

288
00:20:21.44 --> 00:20:23.52
That's what we're looking for.

289
00:20:23.52 --> 00:20:27.08
And have your opponent recognize that before the battle takes place.

290
00:20:27.08 --> 00:20:31.44
So, optimally, yes, optimally they go, you know what, we don't even have a chance.

291
00:20:31.44 --> 00:20:35.04
If they don't recognize it cool, you're in such a good position that it doesn't matter

292
00:20:35.04 --> 00:20:37.04
anyways in the battles over very quickly.

293
00:20:37.04 --> 00:20:38.04
Yeah.

294
00:20:38.04 --> 00:20:39.64
I mean, I'm writing things down.

295
00:20:39.64 --> 00:20:43.20
I mean, just the things inside what he just said.

296
00:20:43.20 --> 00:20:49.48
I've had just the first thing of the common about study is designed to modify conclusions.

297
00:20:49.48 --> 00:20:54.76
Not to validate your conclusion, like I'm going to go to research and I'm going to literally

298
00:20:54.76 --> 00:20:59.52
just overlook and bypass anything that doesn't align with what I already think I know.

299
00:20:59.52 --> 00:21:01.52
I'm just like, that's not convenient.

300
00:21:01.52 --> 00:21:02.52
So I'm going to skip that.

301
00:21:02.52 --> 00:21:06.04
So I'm going to find, I'm going to study so I can find information to reinforce what I already

302
00:21:06.04 --> 00:21:07.04
know.

303
00:21:07.04 --> 00:21:11.80
He's like, no, I'm doing the study to figure out what I thought that's actually wrong.

304
00:21:11.80 --> 00:21:19.68
To modify my conclusions, the inherent humility in that approach, I'm going to study

305
00:21:19.68 --> 00:21:23.80
to find out where I'm wrong.

306
00:21:23.80 --> 00:21:26.36
I'll hard that actually is to do.

307
00:21:26.36 --> 00:21:29.76
And then he used the airsap, this example, and of course, you know, the airsap is a thing

308
00:21:29.76 --> 00:21:30.76
that didn't even exist.

309
00:21:30.76 --> 00:21:34.84
And now it's this thing where the counter culture there, they're the opposing view of,

310
00:21:34.84 --> 00:21:37.000
hey, we need to look at these things differently.

311
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:45.16
And then how quickly, how quickly they solidified around their new approach and became the

312
00:21:45.16 --> 00:21:48.44
inflexible rigid, we are going to stick to these conclusions.

313
00:21:48.44 --> 00:21:53.000
We're going to state of these, we are not going to change our viewpoint of this.

314
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.48
And how quickly that process happens to.

315
00:21:57.48 --> 00:21:59.48
Human beings do not change.

316
00:21:59.48 --> 00:22:00.48
No.

317
00:22:00.48 --> 00:22:01.48
They really don't.

318
00:22:01.48 --> 00:22:04.92
And they really like to dig into whatever they got a hold of.

319
00:22:04.92 --> 00:22:07.12
What didn't got a hold of something they hang onto it totally.

320
00:22:07.12 --> 00:22:14.32
It's like trying to pry a little freaking kid, a three year old with a rattle.

321
00:22:14.32 --> 00:22:15.32
You know what I'm saying?

322
00:22:15.32 --> 00:22:16.32
They got that rattle.

323
00:22:16.32 --> 00:22:18.76
Go and try and take that away from them.

324
00:22:18.76 --> 00:22:20.16
Why is that?

325
00:22:20.16 --> 00:22:23.000
It's a human instinct to hang onto what you've got.

326
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.64
And you see the general staff after 32 years of military service in 150 years of combined

327
00:22:29.64 --> 00:22:33.12
military service between these three four generals.

328
00:22:33.12 --> 00:22:37.04
And they have that new rattle that they got a hold of.

329
00:22:37.04 --> 00:22:39.32
And they won't let go of it.

330
00:22:39.32 --> 00:22:40.48
Yeah.

331
00:22:40.48 --> 00:22:42.32
And they're going to kick and scream.

332
00:22:42.32 --> 00:22:44.32
It's disturbing.

333
00:22:44.32 --> 00:22:45.32
It's crazy.

334
00:22:45.32 --> 00:22:49.08
And he said something to that that he's referenced.

335
00:22:49.08 --> 00:22:50.52
You've already said it.

336
00:22:50.52 --> 00:22:55.88
And this one kind of finally stuck is he's making the connection to leadership.

337
00:22:55.88 --> 00:22:58.08
He's not talking about Klaus Wood so much.

338
00:22:58.08 --> 00:23:01.72
He keeps saying about his students, his disciples.

339
00:23:01.72 --> 00:23:05.68
The influence he had on a generation of leaders.

340
00:23:05.68 --> 00:23:14.44
And the tragedy that was created by that based on Klaus Wood's influence over people.

341
00:23:14.44 --> 00:23:18.84
And he's made the illusion too like that really wasn't his intent.

342
00:23:18.84 --> 00:23:19.84
He definitely last podcast.

343
00:23:19.84 --> 00:23:22.84
He definitely pointed out that that was not his intent.

344
00:23:22.84 --> 00:23:23.84
Totally.

345
00:23:23.84 --> 00:23:28.64
But the power for better for worse the power of that leadership.

346
00:23:28.64 --> 00:23:32.04
And if you have disciples and you've said this over and over again.

347
00:23:32.04 --> 00:23:40.32
And again, I don't remember the exact quote, but the uneducated disciples are more dangerous

348
00:23:40.32 --> 00:23:42.44
than the enemy.

349
00:23:42.44 --> 00:23:50.12
And to just blindly follow the language or the words of the leader and just try to go implement

350
00:23:50.12 --> 00:23:53.44
them without truly understanding the context.

351
00:23:53.44 --> 00:23:58.64
And then the evolving application of that to the world that they're going to be in.

352
00:23:58.64 --> 00:24:02.68
It's, I put the front, from those two pages, just pointing out those things.

353
00:24:02.68 --> 00:24:05.000
How critical those things are.

354
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.84
Can you fathom the freaking group think that's going on?

355
00:24:10.84 --> 00:24:11.84
Check it out.

356
00:24:11.84 --> 00:24:18.96
Not only is everyone on my side bought into this bullshit.

357
00:24:18.96 --> 00:24:28.20
So my entire freaking army of millions of people is all bought into this idea and your

358
00:24:28.20 --> 00:24:33.04
side and your millions of soldiers and leaders are all bought to the same idea.

359
00:24:33.04 --> 00:24:35.28
Imagine how crazy that is.

360
00:24:35.28 --> 00:24:41.36
Imagine how crazy it is that our group think is so strong that both opposing sides both

361
00:24:41.36 --> 00:24:49.76
are bought into the same group think at the peril of millions of soldiers.

362
00:24:49.76 --> 00:24:54.56
Like that's not to think how strong that group think is to think I'm looking at you and

363
00:24:54.56 --> 00:24:58.56
you're doing the exact same thing as me and I'm thinking well, we're just going to keep

364
00:24:58.56 --> 00:25:01.60
doing it and you're looking at me thinking we're going to keep doing it and neither one

365
00:25:01.60 --> 00:25:03.92
of us is able to say you know what this doesn't make any sense.

366
00:25:03.92 --> 00:25:06.28
Hey, are you looking at what our enemy is doing?

367
00:25:06.28 --> 00:25:08.72
This is, this seems kind of dumb.

368
00:25:08.72 --> 00:25:13.76
The power of the group think there, the power of, you know, we always talk about right,

369
00:25:13.76 --> 00:25:17.40
you got to detach and you got to take a more strategic view.

370
00:25:17.40 --> 00:25:24.40
These are the freaking generals on both sides at the same time.

371
00:25:24.40 --> 00:25:30.000
At the same time wrapped up in the identical group think when they are getting a daily

372
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:38.68
dose of reality, the most stark reality that human beings have ever seen.

373
00:25:38.68 --> 00:25:46.24
They're getting slapped in the face with that on the daily basis and they never look

374
00:25:46.24 --> 00:25:49.76
around and say hey you know what, this is freaking stupid.

375
00:25:49.76 --> 00:25:51.96
What are we doing?

376
00:25:51.96 --> 00:25:56.72
This is the sickest group think, fathomable.

377
00:25:56.72 --> 00:26:00.20
It's crazy.

378
00:26:00.20 --> 00:26:02.12
So it's detach.

379
00:26:02.12 --> 00:26:07.68
It's detach but like detaching to the strategic levels, not enough.

380
00:26:07.68 --> 00:26:13.20
If you're surrounded, if you're completely surrounded, if you're in the virtual reality

381
00:26:13.20 --> 00:26:17.08
goggles on, no matter where you look, it's like you're in the game.

382
00:26:17.08 --> 00:26:20.84
You need to take those things off your head.

383
00:26:20.84 --> 00:26:29.20
Alright, this is the last chapter that we're going to cover in this book.

384
00:26:29.20 --> 00:26:34.04
It's called Grand Strategy.

385
00:26:34.04 --> 00:26:36.000
It's going to tie into a lot of things.

386
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.96
This book is concerned with strategy rather than with Grand Strategy or war policy.

387
00:26:39.96 --> 00:26:45.40
To deal adequately with this wider subject would require not only a much larger volume

388
00:26:45.40 --> 00:26:47.32
but a separate volume.

389
00:26:47.32 --> 00:26:53.52
For while Grand Strategy should control strategy, it's principles often run counter to those

390
00:26:53.52 --> 00:26:58.88
which prevail in the field of strategy.

391
00:26:58.88 --> 00:27:03.16
For that very reason, however, it is desirable to include here some indication of the

392
00:27:03.16 --> 00:27:10.44
deeper conclusions to which a study of Grand Strategy leads.

393
00:27:10.44 --> 00:27:14.08
The object in war, so this is an interesting setup.

394
00:27:14.08 --> 00:27:20.96
The setup is, hey, what I've been talking about at this strategic level, we're actually

395
00:27:20.96 --> 00:27:24.88
actually going to have some principles that are countered to that when we go up one more

396
00:27:24.88 --> 00:27:25.88
level.

397
00:27:25.88 --> 00:27:29.88
So this is a very interesting setup.

398
00:27:29.88 --> 00:27:35.72
The object in war is to attain a better piece, even if only from your own point of view.

399
00:27:35.72 --> 00:27:41.88
Hence it is essential to conduct war with constant regard to the piece you desire.

400
00:27:41.88 --> 00:27:45.72
That would appear to be common sense.

401
00:27:45.72 --> 00:27:48.52
What are we trying to get done?

402
00:27:48.52 --> 00:27:50.88
How can we get it done?

403
00:27:50.88 --> 00:27:56.24
Not just to win right now, but how can we set ourselves up in the grand future so that we're

404
00:27:56.24 --> 00:27:58.88
doing what we want to, so in this situation we want to be in.

405
00:27:58.88 --> 00:28:06.72
This is the underlying cloud switch definition of war as a, quote, continuation of fallacy

406
00:28:06.72 --> 00:28:12.40
by other means and quote, the prolongation of that policy through the war into the subsequent

407
00:28:12.40 --> 00:28:15.28
priests must always be born in mind.

408
00:28:15.28 --> 00:28:18.32
So you always have to think about the future.

409
00:28:18.32 --> 00:28:23.36
You always have to think about the future.

410
00:28:23.36 --> 00:28:25.16
You have to think strategically over time.

411
00:28:25.16 --> 00:28:32.64
All at all times a state which expands its strength to the point of exhaustion bankrupts

412
00:28:32.64 --> 00:28:35.16
its own policy and future.

413
00:28:35.16 --> 00:28:37.20
Again, what's the ROI?

414
00:28:37.20 --> 00:28:40.12
What's the ROI and what we're doing?

415
00:28:40.12 --> 00:28:44.84
We are spending all of our capital to make something happen and we look up and cool.

416
00:28:44.84 --> 00:28:47.04
We made it happen, but we have no capital left.

417
00:28:47.04 --> 00:28:48.24
We can't pay our employees.

418
00:28:48.24 --> 00:28:52.36
We can't order anymore of our supplies.

419
00:28:52.36 --> 00:28:54.28
Good job.

420
00:28:54.28 --> 00:28:56.80
No, not a good job.

421
00:28:56.80 --> 00:29:01.68
If you concentrate exclusively on victory with no thought for the after effect, you may

422
00:29:01.68 --> 00:29:07.24
be too exhausted to profit by the peace while it is almost certain that the peace will

423
00:29:07.24 --> 00:29:11.48
be a bad one containing the germs of another war.

424
00:29:11.48 --> 00:29:18.60
This is a lesson supported by abundant experience.

425
00:29:18.60 --> 00:29:22.80
I brought up this quote again, one of the previous podcasts about, hey, cool, you want to

426
00:29:22.80 --> 00:29:25.16
now you're in charge of a wasteland.

427
00:29:25.16 --> 00:29:27.12
How about a leadership capital perspective?

428
00:29:27.12 --> 00:29:28.12
Cool.

429
00:29:28.12 --> 00:29:32.000
I got Dave to do what I told him to do and now he hates working here and he's not going

430
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.80
to do a good job and he's putting his resume out there to everybody else.

431
00:29:35.80 --> 00:29:36.80
Good job.

432
00:29:36.80 --> 00:29:40.72
Cool, but I got him to do what I wanted to do.

433
00:29:40.72 --> 00:29:47.52
I won, but he's got the germs of another war.

434
00:29:47.52 --> 00:29:50.56
And by the way, go look at what happened between World War 1 and World War 2.

435
00:29:50.56 --> 00:29:51.56
Yeah.

436
00:29:51.56 --> 00:29:52.56
Exactly what it is.

437
00:29:52.56 --> 00:29:59.40
It's referring to, let me just, other examples, but that's a freaking perfect one.

438
00:29:59.40 --> 00:30:03.72
No one was happy at the end of that war.

439
00:30:03.72 --> 00:30:09.36
The risks become greater still in any war that is waged by a coalition.

440
00:30:09.36 --> 00:30:15.20
For in such a case, a two complete victory inevitably complicates the problem of making

441
00:30:15.20 --> 00:30:19.24
a Justin Wise peace settlement where there is no longer a counterbalance of an opposing

442
00:30:19.24 --> 00:30:23.44
force to control the appetite to the victors, there is no check on the conflicting views

443
00:30:23.44 --> 00:30:27.68
and interests between party Z. Alliance, what a brilliant statement, right?

444
00:30:27.68 --> 00:30:33.32
This is 19, I guess he's one, this is, so this is after World War 2.

445
00:30:33.32 --> 00:30:34.32
Yeah, absolutely.

446
00:30:34.32 --> 00:30:38.76
It has to be, I mean, that reference to American Russia like that.

447
00:30:38.76 --> 00:30:39.76
Yep, cool.

448
00:30:39.76 --> 00:30:40.76
Yep.

449
00:30:40.76 --> 00:30:41.76
We work together.

450
00:30:41.76 --> 00:30:47.28
And as soon as we don't have our common enemy anymore, now we're pissed at each other.

451
00:30:47.28 --> 00:30:53.16
The divergences then apt to come so acute as to turn the comradeship of common danger

452
00:30:53.16 --> 00:30:55.64
into the hostility of mutual dissatisfaction.

453
00:30:55.64 --> 00:30:59.24
So the ally of one war becomes the enemy in the next, there you go.

454
00:30:59.24 --> 00:31:01.000
Hello, sovia Union.

455
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.16
Yeah.

456
00:31:02.16 --> 00:31:03.32
Versus America.

457
00:31:03.32 --> 00:31:07.28
This raises a further and wider question.

458
00:31:07.28 --> 00:31:12.76
The friction that commonly develops in any alliance system, especially when it has no balancing

459
00:31:12.76 --> 00:31:17.48
force has been one of the factors that have fostered numerous attempts throughout fist

460
00:31:17.48 --> 00:31:21.08
history to find solution infusion.

461
00:31:21.08 --> 00:31:25.80
So joining together, this is like an opulatoon.

462
00:31:25.80 --> 00:31:27.88
You have a platoon.

463
00:31:27.88 --> 00:31:30.96
If you leave them alone for a little while, they'll start fighting each other.

464
00:31:30.96 --> 00:31:34.32
That's just what's going to happen.

465
00:31:34.32 --> 00:31:36.68
There's no balancing forces, no one to go against.

466
00:31:36.68 --> 00:31:38.36
Even if it's this, the training cadre.

467
00:31:38.36 --> 00:31:41.80
That's enough of a, you know, we'll go against those guys, our another platoon.

468
00:31:41.80 --> 00:31:45.92
Once they're alone, they're going to start fighting each other.

469
00:31:45.92 --> 00:31:50.76
So we look for solutions infusion, but history teaches us that in practice, this is apt

470
00:31:50.76 --> 00:31:54.28
to mean domination by one of the constituent elements.

471
00:31:54.28 --> 00:31:57.84
And although there is a natural tendency toward the fusion of small groups and a larger

472
00:31:57.84 --> 00:32:02.84
ones, the usual result of forcing the pace is the confusion of the plans to establish

473
00:32:02.84 --> 00:32:05.24
a comprehensive political unit.

474
00:32:05.24 --> 00:32:06.24
Kind of it.

475
00:32:06.24 --> 00:32:08.36
I will say that's a pretty pessimistic view.

476
00:32:08.36 --> 00:32:12.16
It's a realistic view, but it's a pessimistic view.

477
00:32:12.16 --> 00:32:16.000
More over regrettable as it may seem to the idealist, the experience of history provides

478
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.68
little warmth for the belief that real progress and the freedom that makes progress possible

479
00:32:20.68 --> 00:32:21.68
wise and unification.

480
00:32:21.68 --> 00:32:24.20
And this is something we need to pay attention to.

481
00:32:24.20 --> 00:32:29.68
For where unification has been able to establish unity of ideas, it has usually ended

482
00:32:29.68 --> 00:32:35.000
in uniformity, paralyzing the growth of new ideas.

483
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.76
And where unification has merely brought about an artificial or imposed unity, it is

484
00:32:39.76 --> 00:32:41.88
Erksom.

485
00:32:41.88 --> 00:32:45.88
It's Erksomness has led through discord to disruption.

486
00:32:45.88 --> 00:32:50.44
I love that from a leadership perspective.

487
00:32:50.44 --> 00:32:52.12
We get everyone on board with a plan.

488
00:32:52.12 --> 00:32:53.48
Hey, listen, everyone just lock it up.

489
00:32:53.48 --> 00:32:55.52
We're going with my plan.

490
00:32:55.52 --> 00:32:57.80
It seems to help, right?

491
00:32:57.80 --> 00:33:00.80
It seems to help, but by the way, no one's now thinking.

492
00:33:00.80 --> 00:33:02.76
And on top of that, people are pissed.

493
00:33:02.76 --> 00:33:04.000
Discord.

494
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.04
So now as soon as something goes wrong, we got an element that's breaking off.

495
00:33:08.04 --> 00:33:10.08
You got people complaining.

496
00:33:10.08 --> 00:33:11.08
Why is that?

497
00:33:11.08 --> 00:33:14.08
We're trying to force uniformity.

498
00:33:14.08 --> 00:33:17.40
We're trying to force people to think the same way.

499
00:33:17.40 --> 00:33:20.000
It's a problem.

500
00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.28
Vitality springs from diversity, which makes for real progress so long as there is mutual

501
00:33:25.28 --> 00:33:28.44
toleration.

502
00:33:28.44 --> 00:33:32.48
Based on the recognition that worse may come from an attempt to suppress differences

503
00:33:32.48 --> 00:33:35.24
than from acceptance of them.

504
00:33:35.24 --> 00:33:39.16
Again, if you're in a leader and you got someone that's a little outside the lines

505
00:33:39.16 --> 00:33:45.84
and all you do is beat them into submission, it's not helping.

506
00:33:45.84 --> 00:33:50.08
For this reason, the kind of piece that makes progress possible is best assured by the mutual

507
00:33:50.08 --> 00:33:56.24
checks created by a balance of forces alike in the sphere of internal politics and of

508
00:33:56.24 --> 00:34:00.16
international relations.

509
00:34:00.16 --> 00:34:10.04
So he goes into a little bit about the balance of power and politics.

510
00:34:10.04 --> 00:34:16.04
He says any monopoly of power leads to ever repeated demonstrations of the historical truth,

511
00:34:16.04 --> 00:34:20.60
epitomized and Lord Acton's famous dictum all power corrupts and absolute power corrupts

512
00:34:20.60 --> 00:34:25.60
absolutely.

513
00:34:25.60 --> 00:34:29.24
Another conclusion which develops from the study of Grand Strategy against the background

514
00:34:29.24 --> 00:34:33.88
of history is the practical necessity of adapting the general theory of strategy to the

515
00:34:33.88 --> 00:34:37.16
nature of a nation's fundamental policy.

516
00:34:37.16 --> 00:34:39.24
God, make sure you're aligned.

517
00:34:39.24 --> 00:34:43.80
God, make sure you're aligned.

518
00:34:43.80 --> 00:34:51.16
Goes into the difference between an acquisition of state and a conservative state, meaning

519
00:34:51.16 --> 00:34:56.04
hey, my state is going out to acquire other properties that we're going to go on the attack

520
00:34:56.04 --> 00:35:00.96
and a conservative state, which is hey, we're just trying to maintain what we've got.

521
00:35:00.96 --> 00:35:08.16
The Equisitive State inherently unsatisfied needs to gain victory in order to gain its

522
00:35:08.16 --> 00:35:12.12
object and must therefore court greater risks in the attempt.

523
00:35:12.12 --> 00:35:17.44
The conservative state can achieve its object by merely inducing the aggressor to drop his

524
00:35:17.44 --> 00:35:23.44
attempt at conquest by convincing him that the game is not worth the candle.

525
00:35:23.44 --> 00:35:28.68
In victory, its victory isn't a real sense attained by foiling one's bid.

526
00:35:28.68 --> 00:35:33.80
One side's, look, by foiling the other side's bid for victory.

527
00:35:33.80 --> 00:35:40.28
Indeed, in attempting more, it may defeat its own purpose by exhausting itself so much

528
00:35:40.28 --> 00:35:47.20
that it's unable to resist other enemies or the internal effects of overstrain.

529
00:35:47.20 --> 00:35:54.20
If exhaustion in war has killed more states than any foreign assailants and how often do

530
00:35:54.20 --> 00:35:56.44
we see that in companies?

531
00:35:56.44 --> 00:36:02.32
How often do we see in companies where they are just going so hard and investing in so

532
00:36:02.32 --> 00:36:08.36
many different places and chewing up their teams?

533
00:36:08.36 --> 00:36:17.20
We have to be cognizant of that.

534
00:36:17.20 --> 00:36:19.92
Waving these factors, the problem that can be seen that the problem of a conservative

535
00:36:19.92 --> 00:36:24.44
state is to find the type of strategy that is suited to fulfill its inherently more limited

536
00:36:24.44 --> 00:36:31.12
object in the most strengthened, serving way so as to ensure future as well as presence.

537
00:36:31.12 --> 00:36:35.04
Now, there's a reason I'm covering this part because of this statement.

538
00:36:35.04 --> 00:36:41.56
At first glance, it might seem that pure defense would be the most economical method.

539
00:36:41.56 --> 00:36:49.16
But this implies static defense and historical experience warns us that it is dangerously

540
00:36:49.16 --> 00:36:52.08
brittle method on which to rely.

541
00:36:52.08 --> 00:36:57.68
Economy of force and deterrent affect our best combined in defensive offensive method

542
00:36:57.68 --> 00:37:06.40
based on high mobility that carries the power of a quick repost.

543
00:37:06.40 --> 00:37:09.92
And a quick repost is a move in fencing.

544
00:37:09.92 --> 00:37:13.52
It's a thrust in fencing.

545
00:37:13.52 --> 00:37:15.28
So it's cool to think, you know what?

546
00:37:15.28 --> 00:37:16.28
We're just going to conserve.

547
00:37:16.28 --> 00:37:17.28
We're going to stay here.

548
00:37:17.28 --> 00:37:18.12
We're going to be on the defensive.

549
00:37:18.12 --> 00:37:20.44
But we have to remember that historically speaking.

550
00:37:20.44 --> 00:37:26.16
And when he's talking about historically speaking, he's talking about a massive swath of history

551
00:37:26.16 --> 00:37:31.96
that he's looked at to confirm that you've got to have some offense.

552
00:37:31.96 --> 00:37:34.52
You've got to be on offense.

553
00:37:34.52 --> 00:37:35.52
And we say this a lot.

554
00:37:35.52 --> 00:37:42.32
Like if you're not growing, you're losing totally.

555
00:37:42.32 --> 00:37:50.16
He's also clearly learned the lesson that he's kind of accused of not applying, which

556
00:37:50.16 --> 00:37:58.60
is the context to the statements where you say, hey, the conservative approach and

557
00:37:58.60 --> 00:38:05.40
all by the way, if you're over there thinking that I'm telling you dig in and be conservative,

558
00:38:05.40 --> 00:38:07.20
that's not what I'm saying.

559
00:38:07.20 --> 00:38:13.76
And to clarify and have the understanding of the common itself, so the comment or the headline

560
00:38:13.76 --> 00:38:19.48
doesn't become the story, which he referenced so many times of, hey, the statement became

561
00:38:19.48 --> 00:38:25.68
its own interpretation, the same became its own truth when it's not really what he meant.

562
00:38:25.68 --> 00:38:30.04
But he didn't actually take the time to make sure his disciples, his learners understood,

563
00:38:30.04 --> 00:38:31.84
I'm not saying dig in.

564
00:38:31.84 --> 00:38:33.32
I'm not saying that.

565
00:38:33.32 --> 00:38:36.96
And I know if you're hearing that, let me be more clear what this approach really

566
00:38:36.96 --> 00:38:37.96
means.

567
00:38:37.96 --> 00:38:40.72
And that's clearly a lesson he's taken from.

568
00:38:40.72 --> 00:38:44.12
The other leaders that didn't do that and the outcomes of that creates when you don't

569
00:38:44.12 --> 00:38:45.12
actually explain what you mean.

570
00:38:45.12 --> 00:38:50.40
We talked about almost as a joke inside of your, don't care, or you know, hold the line.

571
00:38:50.40 --> 00:38:53.88
And if you're hearing, I hold the line on all things.

572
00:38:53.88 --> 00:38:54.88
Let me be more clear.

573
00:38:54.88 --> 00:38:55.88
That's not what I'm saying.

574
00:38:55.88 --> 00:38:58.48
I'm saying this, this, and this, and this, and this, and how you apply this.

575
00:38:58.48 --> 00:39:02.76
So I really like the idea that he's taking the comment and then giving the context around

576
00:39:02.76 --> 00:39:04.72
us people can understand what he's talking about.

577
00:39:04.72 --> 00:39:07.32
The people that are actually studying what he's saying.

578
00:39:07.32 --> 00:39:16.28
The idea of the dichotomy of leadership, that idea came to me because I was working with

579
00:39:16.28 --> 00:39:18.52
these young junior officers.

580
00:39:18.52 --> 00:39:19.80
And you know what they want to do?

581
00:39:19.80 --> 00:39:21.80
They want to do good.

582
00:39:21.80 --> 00:39:23.92
They want to do good.

583
00:39:23.92 --> 00:39:29.40
So if you tell them to be aggressive, cool, got it.

584
00:39:29.40 --> 00:39:32.52
They are on freaking level 14, berserk remote.

585
00:39:32.52 --> 00:39:35.08
They're charging into whatever.

586
00:39:35.08 --> 00:39:41.96
You tell them not to move.

587
00:39:41.96 --> 00:39:45.60
You tell them, hey, make sure you take the high ground.

588
00:39:45.60 --> 00:39:47.52
Cool, guess what they're doing.

589
00:39:47.52 --> 00:39:51.60
They're running to the top of every freaking hill that they see.

590
00:39:51.60 --> 00:39:52.60
Yeah.

591
00:39:52.60 --> 00:39:56.92
So, so anything that I would tell them, there was a, there was, they had a proclivity

592
00:39:56.92 --> 00:39:59.28
to take it to the extreme.

593
00:39:59.28 --> 00:40:06.48
And so within like one or two iterations at our land warfare training facility, I was

594
00:40:06.48 --> 00:40:09.04
like, okay, I got to tell these guys that there has to be balance.

595
00:40:09.04 --> 00:40:10.88
That everything that I'm saying has to be balanced.

596
00:40:10.88 --> 00:40:12.48
Every single thing that I'm saying has to be balanced.

597
00:40:12.48 --> 00:40:15.04
If you take anything that I'm saying and you take it to an extreme, it's going to be

598
00:40:15.04 --> 00:40:19.000
bad.

599
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.40
So I tried to do the same thing.

600
00:40:22.40 --> 00:40:28.88
It's kind of a universal, I mean, I hate to say it's like a cop out.

601
00:40:28.88 --> 00:40:32.56
You know, because it's like, you know, if your ego's, you're saying ego's no good.

602
00:40:32.56 --> 00:40:34.04
No, actually, it's a balance, right?

603
00:40:34.04 --> 00:40:35.48
And it kind of sounds like a cop out.

604
00:40:35.48 --> 00:40:36.80
Does it sound like a little bit of a cop out?

605
00:40:36.80 --> 00:40:38.16
Echo channels, you seem to agree with me.

606
00:40:38.16 --> 00:40:42.08
Yeah, I mean, it can, yeah, but no.

607
00:40:42.08 --> 00:40:43.08
Yes, but no.

608
00:40:43.08 --> 00:40:47.64
I mean, it's a real bummer, I think, not a bummer, but someone will say, well, you're

609
00:40:47.64 --> 00:40:53.88
saying that, you know, you're saying that the ego is bad, but the ego's, the ego's, you

610
00:40:53.88 --> 00:40:56.64
know, I don't want to hire people that bunch of pushovers.

611
00:40:56.64 --> 00:40:57.64
Yeah.

612
00:40:57.64 --> 00:41:02.64
Yeah, I know man, that's the dichotomy and they're kind of like, oh, they're like,

613
00:41:02.64 --> 00:41:05.08
they think I don't have that, they forget that I have that.

614
00:41:05.08 --> 00:41:09.48
You know, and it's why I feel like bad sometimes pulling the dichotomy card, but it's the

615
00:41:09.48 --> 00:41:10.48
truth.

616
00:41:10.48 --> 00:41:11.48
Yeah.

617
00:41:11.48 --> 00:41:14.20
The truth is, man, you take something to the extreme and it's bad.

618
00:41:14.20 --> 00:41:15.20
Yeah.

619
00:41:15.20 --> 00:41:17.20
That's the truth.

620
00:41:17.20 --> 00:41:18.56
You still don't like it?

621
00:41:18.56 --> 00:41:24.08
No, I agree with you where it's like, you know that it's not a cop out.

622
00:41:24.08 --> 00:41:29.08
In fact, it's the opposite of a cop out.

623
00:41:29.08 --> 00:41:30.08
Yeah.

624
00:41:30.08 --> 00:41:31.08
It's just more to it than that.

625
00:41:31.08 --> 00:41:35.92
In fact, when someone doesn't recognize the dichotomy, that might be the more of the

626
00:41:35.92 --> 00:41:36.92
cop out.

627
00:41:36.92 --> 00:41:38.92
It's kind of like, oh, you say go here, oh, I went there.

628
00:41:38.92 --> 00:41:39.92
I went there.

629
00:41:39.92 --> 00:41:40.92
That's what you said, right?

630
00:41:40.92 --> 00:41:42.92
It's like, right, you got to start using your judgment a little bit.

631
00:41:42.92 --> 00:41:43.92
You know?

632
00:41:43.92 --> 00:41:44.92
Yep.

633
00:41:44.92 --> 00:41:50.92
You were talking about, does it sound like a cop out?

634
00:41:50.92 --> 00:41:55.56
And in the scenarios of top-gun, you know, everything is like a scenario.

635
00:41:55.56 --> 00:41:56.96
What do I do in this situation?

636
00:41:56.96 --> 00:41:57.96
How do I react?

637
00:41:57.96 --> 00:42:03.76
And like the classic answer, the classic answer was always, it depends.

638
00:42:03.76 --> 00:42:06.28
Which had this feeling of like, it's a cop out.

639
00:42:06.28 --> 00:42:09.56
It's a cop out and like, oh, you don't really know or you don't have to be definitive

640
00:42:09.56 --> 00:42:13.04
because at their times when people want a black and white, they want a black and white

641
00:42:13.04 --> 00:42:14.04
answer.

642
00:42:14.04 --> 00:42:15.44
If I have this situation, what do I do?

643
00:42:15.44 --> 00:42:16.44
It depends.

644
00:42:16.44 --> 00:42:17.84
Well, it actually depends.

645
00:42:17.84 --> 00:42:21.96
But it actually does depend.

646
00:42:21.96 --> 00:42:22.96
It's not a cop out.

647
00:42:22.96 --> 00:42:23.96
It does.

648
00:42:23.96 --> 00:42:30.32
Because it's not satisfying and it requires like contemplation and understanding of the

649
00:42:30.32 --> 00:42:32.80
nuance and how did I get here in the first place?

650
00:42:32.80 --> 00:42:34.76
What am I trying to accomplish?

651
00:42:34.76 --> 00:42:41.04
So I was just thinking to myself when you were talking about this feeling of it sounds

652
00:42:41.04 --> 00:42:45.92
like a cop out was the answer I gave 5000 times a top-gun to the students.

653
00:42:45.92 --> 00:42:46.92
It depends.

654
00:42:46.92 --> 00:42:50.000
And then you got a digging and go through it and go, well actually in the case that you're

655
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.68
describing, this might actually be a better answer than in the same situation but driven

656
00:42:54.68 --> 00:42:59.24
by another goal or got there for a different reason, hey, I might go a different direction

657
00:42:59.24 --> 00:43:00.24
here.

658
00:43:00.24 --> 00:43:04.08
And then you as a leader have to actually apply some judgment in real time as opposed to this

659
00:43:04.08 --> 00:43:05.64
situation requires this response.

660
00:43:05.64 --> 00:43:07.08
Well, it's not that simple.

661
00:43:07.08 --> 00:43:08.08
Hey, a salty leader.

662
00:43:08.08 --> 00:43:11.000
What are you doing way back there when they're all bogged down up in the front?

663
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Yeah.

664
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.96
Well, you told me not to get engaged in like the room room clearance.

665
00:43:14.96 --> 00:43:15.96
Totally.

666
00:43:15.96 --> 00:43:16.96
But they're bogged down.

667
00:43:16.96 --> 00:43:17.96
Yeah.

668
00:43:17.96 --> 00:43:22.16
That you're example of where should the platoon commander be in a patrol?

669
00:43:22.16 --> 00:43:23.16
It depends.

670
00:43:23.16 --> 00:43:24.16
Yeah, where it makes sense.

671
00:43:24.16 --> 00:43:25.16
Totally.

672
00:43:25.16 --> 00:43:26.16
Could be in the front?

673
00:43:26.16 --> 00:43:27.16
Could be in the back?

674
00:43:27.16 --> 00:43:29.16
Could be in the middle?

675
00:43:29.16 --> 00:43:30.16
No.

676
00:43:30.16 --> 00:43:31.48
And I guess we've hit this.

677
00:43:31.48 --> 00:43:36.72
I'm probably beating at dead horse a little bit but the unsatisfying nature of that answer

678
00:43:36.72 --> 00:43:39.72
when I got to the basic school.

679
00:43:39.72 --> 00:43:42.96
I'm a brand new second lieutenant.

680
00:43:42.96 --> 00:43:48.32
And we get to the the the the basic school and right outside of the main headquarters building

681
00:43:48.32 --> 00:43:52.80
is this giant bronze statue of the lieutenant.

682
00:43:52.80 --> 00:43:53.80
And he's in this post.

683
00:43:53.80 --> 00:43:54.80
He's got his rifle.

684
00:43:54.80 --> 00:43:57.52
His porno's arm up and it says follow me.

685
00:43:57.52 --> 00:44:00.72
You know, which is what they push you.

686
00:44:00.72 --> 00:44:02.48
He's lead from the front.

687
00:44:02.48 --> 00:44:04.24
Get out in front of your man.

688
00:44:04.24 --> 00:44:07.16
And in a lot of ways.

689
00:44:07.16 --> 00:44:08.16
That's right.

690
00:44:08.16 --> 00:44:09.16
That's right.

691
00:44:09.16 --> 00:44:10.16
To have that.

692
00:44:10.16 --> 00:44:13.80
But in a lot of ways, it's actually not right.

693
00:44:13.80 --> 00:44:23.56
But place yourself where you need to be is nowhere near as cool as cool as follow me.

694
00:44:23.56 --> 00:44:25.40
Lead from the front.

695
00:44:25.40 --> 00:44:27.48
But if that's what you hey, I lead from the front like cool.

696
00:44:27.48 --> 00:44:28.96
You have no idea what's going on back here.

697
00:44:28.96 --> 00:44:33.76
And half of your guys just got hammered because of that.

698
00:44:33.76 --> 00:44:39.44
There's this, I think this compulsion, which is why the class would think plays so well

699
00:44:39.44 --> 00:44:44.92
to the, the, the, even just the catch phrases of leadership, which don't actually serve

700
00:44:44.92 --> 00:44:46.40
a leader very well.

701
00:44:46.40 --> 00:44:47.40
Lead from the front.

702
00:44:47.40 --> 00:44:50.48
Who's going to say like that's a terrible leadership philosophy, but actually sometimes

703
00:44:50.48 --> 00:44:51.80
you don't want to be in the front.

704
00:44:51.80 --> 00:44:55.28
Yeah, which is why I have a section in leadership strategy and tactics, which is actually

705
00:44:55.28 --> 00:44:56.28
called lead from the rear.

706
00:44:56.28 --> 00:44:57.28
Totally.

707
00:44:57.28 --> 00:45:05.96
So it kind of like, you have to like the more under because there has to be the formula

708
00:45:05.96 --> 00:45:07.48
right at some level.

709
00:45:07.48 --> 00:45:12.64
Like obviously at the, at the surface, the formula is like, or you might, someone might

710
00:45:12.64 --> 00:45:17.04
make them mistake the formula is lead from the front at all times, right?

711
00:45:17.04 --> 00:45:18.72
But that's not the formula.

712
00:45:18.72 --> 00:45:19.72
Formal is it depends.

713
00:45:19.72 --> 00:45:20.72
Okay, on what?

714
00:45:20.72 --> 00:45:22.72
And there's a formula under there.

715
00:45:22.72 --> 00:45:26.76
But then under there, you're like, okay, well, if this and this and this, it depends a

716
00:45:26.76 --> 00:45:27.76
little bit more.

717
00:45:27.76 --> 00:45:32.80
And the deeper you go, there has to be some formula, right?

718
00:45:32.80 --> 00:45:33.80
No.

719
00:45:33.80 --> 00:45:36.12
Okay, so that and that's what I was going to say too here.

720
00:45:36.12 --> 00:45:39.20
So the, the, the formula, you know what, I have the formula, you know what the formula

721
00:45:39.20 --> 00:45:40.20
is?

722
00:45:40.20 --> 00:45:44.24
It's in that economy or Dave will tell you the formula is, it depends.

723
00:45:44.24 --> 00:45:45.24
Yeah.

724
00:45:45.24 --> 00:45:46.24
So I feel like, yeah.

725
00:45:46.24 --> 00:45:47.24
Yeah.

726
00:45:47.24 --> 00:45:49.24
So both of those are cop out of answers you don't want to hear them.

727
00:45:49.24 --> 00:45:50.24
No, no, no, no.

728
00:45:50.24 --> 00:45:51.36
No, no, I'm actually agreeing with you.

729
00:45:51.36 --> 00:45:53.36
Like that, that's what I would have said too.

730
00:45:53.36 --> 00:45:55.92
It's going to always depend.

731
00:45:55.92 --> 00:45:56.92
Okay.

732
00:45:56.92 --> 00:46:01.36
So, and also on top of it, there's more than one right answer a lot of the time.

733
00:46:01.36 --> 00:46:07.64
Pretty much all the time, pretty much with very few exceptions, I would think.

734
00:46:07.64 --> 00:46:08.64
There are wrong answers.

735
00:46:08.64 --> 00:46:10.36
Oh, yeah, yeah, I agree with that too.

736
00:46:10.36 --> 00:46:11.36
Okay.

737
00:46:11.36 --> 00:46:13.12
But you're saying there's more than one right answer.

738
00:46:13.12 --> 00:46:14.12
Yeah.

739
00:46:14.12 --> 00:46:15.12
Many cases, yes.

740
00:46:15.12 --> 00:46:21.56
So I would say the solution is the more you understand about all of it, the better decision

741
00:46:21.56 --> 00:46:27.16
you can make and the better, the better educated you will be on what decision to make,

742
00:46:27.16 --> 00:46:31.60
give in the parameters of all of that that caught on me is your dealing with.

743
00:46:31.60 --> 00:46:36.28
Except for the fact that you may not have enough information to make the decision that

744
00:46:36.28 --> 00:46:40.60
seems like it's going to be the perfect decision in which case you kind of screwed up by

745
00:46:40.60 --> 00:46:44.92
not moving a little bit more quickly and making decision based on the information that you

746
00:46:44.92 --> 00:46:46.52
had at that current moment.

747
00:46:46.52 --> 00:46:47.52
Yeah.

748
00:46:47.52 --> 00:46:53.84
But when I'm in, when I'm in, what I'm in by knowing, like educated yourself, not on any

749
00:46:53.84 --> 00:46:59.88
specific scenario, I'm saying on how it works, on the dichotomy of leadership, on the

750
00:46:59.88 --> 00:47:01.16
laws of combat or whatever.

751
00:47:01.16 --> 00:47:02.16
Okay.

752
00:47:02.16 --> 00:47:03.16
Yes.

753
00:47:03.16 --> 00:47:04.16
Understand it.

754
00:47:04.16 --> 00:47:05.80
Well, yeah, then you're going back to what I said, which is the formula is, this is an

755
00:47:05.80 --> 00:47:07.000
dichotomy and you got to be balanced.

756
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Yeah.

757
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000
That's the formula.

758
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.40
The formula is be balanced.

759
00:47:10.40 --> 00:47:11.40
Yeah.

760
00:47:11.40 --> 00:47:15.60
Like some, the more you know about the whole game, we'll say the more you know when you're

761
00:47:15.60 --> 00:47:19.36
going to be on this side of the dichotomy or leaning on this side of the dichotomy, the more

762
00:47:19.36 --> 00:47:22.44
you know about yourself, the more you know about it, your guys, building relationships

763
00:47:22.44 --> 00:47:25.64
and by the way, the more you know about this and the more you know about how this works,

764
00:47:25.64 --> 00:47:28.92
then you're going to know more about under what types of circumstances you're going to

765
00:47:28.92 --> 00:47:30.36
lean here, early in the.

766
00:47:30.36 --> 00:47:32.60
You know what's cool?

767
00:47:32.60 --> 00:47:34.56
We have a business called echelon front.

768
00:47:34.56 --> 00:47:35.56
Yes, sir.

769
00:47:35.56 --> 00:47:40.32
The reason we have a business called echelon front is because we have to help leaders

770
00:47:40.32 --> 00:47:42.08
work through these issues.

771
00:47:42.08 --> 00:47:47.84
We can't give them a formula that they can then apply across the board in all situations.

772
00:47:47.84 --> 00:47:52.24
But like you're saying, correctly, if they learn to understand the principles,

773
00:47:52.24 --> 00:47:57.52
they can start to make better decisions and write decisions based on their understanding

774
00:47:57.52 --> 00:48:02.12
of these principles and applying them holistically to their scenario.

775
00:48:02.12 --> 00:48:03.12
Right.

776
00:48:03.12 --> 00:48:04.12
Yes, exactly right.

777
00:48:04.12 --> 00:48:08.56
Which I was going to say, yeah, exactly what I'm saying, where, where do you get the formula

778
00:48:08.56 --> 00:48:09.56
from?

779
00:48:09.56 --> 00:48:14.12
Oh, you're probably the most educated on this whole game as far as the game goes, right?

780
00:48:14.12 --> 00:48:16.92
So the more you let's say you consult with a client, right?

781
00:48:16.92 --> 00:48:20.28
The more you consult with them, hopefully the more they're going to learn that same

782
00:48:20.28 --> 00:48:23.16
game and they're going to need you less and less.

783
00:48:23.16 --> 00:48:24.52
Yes, that's the goal.

784
00:48:24.52 --> 00:48:25.52
Yes, sir.

785
00:48:25.52 --> 00:48:26.52
Absolutely.

786
00:48:26.52 --> 00:48:31.32
All right, back to the book.

787
00:48:31.32 --> 00:48:41.28
The East Roman Empire was a case where such an actively conservative strategy had

788
00:48:41.28 --> 00:48:46.28
been carefully found out as a basis of war policy, a fact which goes far to explain

789
00:48:46.28 --> 00:48:49.40
this empire's unrivaled span of existence.

790
00:48:49.40 --> 00:48:54.76
Another example more instinctive than reasoned is provided by the strategy based on

791
00:48:54.76 --> 00:49:00.04
C power that England practiced in her wars from the 16th to the 19th century.

792
00:49:00.04 --> 00:49:05.08
The value of it was shown by the way that her strength kept pace with her growth while

793
00:49:05.08 --> 00:49:11.16
all her rivals broke down and turned through self-exhaustion and war traceable to their

794
00:49:11.16 --> 00:49:19.96
immoderate desire for the immediate satisfaction of outright victory.

795
00:49:19.96 --> 00:49:26.76
Along series of mutually exhausting and devastating wars above all the 30 years of war

796
00:49:26.76 --> 00:49:33.16
has brought head-brought statesmen by the 18th century to realize the necessity when engaged in

797
00:49:33.16 --> 00:49:41.96
war of curbing both their ambitions and their passions in the interests of their purpose.

798
00:49:41.96 --> 00:49:46.76
On the one hand, this realization tended to produce a tacit limitation of warfare and avoidance

799
00:49:46.76 --> 00:49:50.12
of excesses which might damage after the war prospect.

800
00:49:50.12 --> 00:49:52.96
So he's going back in time and say, look, we can't have learned these lessons.

801
00:49:52.96 --> 00:49:54.12
It was a regression.

802
00:49:54.12 --> 00:49:58.60
That's why earlier in the last podcast we talked about, he talked about, class which was

803
00:49:58.60 --> 00:50:00.000
a regression.

804
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.12
We are going backwards.

805
00:50:02.12 --> 00:50:04.36
Because they had figured this stuff out the 30 years war.

806
00:50:04.36 --> 00:50:08.92
I mean, that's the 1600s you got Germany and Sweden, Sweden, Spain and Catholics.

807
00:50:08.92 --> 00:50:10.52
First probably, all kinds are crazy.

808
00:50:10.52 --> 00:50:13.88
Warfare going on to know to know real decisive victory.

809
00:50:13.88 --> 00:50:17.16
It's a problem they realize that.

810
00:50:17.16 --> 00:50:21.16
Their ambitions and passions frequently carry them too far so that the return to peace

811
00:50:21.16 --> 00:50:25.08
found their countries weakened rather than strengthened.

812
00:50:25.08 --> 00:50:31.24
But they had learned to stop short of national exhaustion.

813
00:50:31.24 --> 00:50:38.68
Which again, you take that for leadership capital and we're expanding more than we have.

814
00:50:38.68 --> 00:50:45.40
At the most satisfactory, at the most satisfactory peace settlements, even for the stronger side,

815
00:50:45.40 --> 00:50:52.56
proved to be those which were made by negotiation rather than decisive military issue.

816
00:50:52.56 --> 00:50:57.92
This gradually education in inherent limitations of war was still in process when it was interrupted

817
00:50:57.92 --> 00:51:04.92
by the French Revolution which brought to the top men who were novices in statemanship.

818
00:51:04.92 --> 00:51:12.56
The directorie and its successor Napoleon pursued the vision of an enduring peace through

819
00:51:12.56 --> 00:51:16.36
war after war for 20 years.

820
00:51:16.36 --> 00:51:17.36
There you go.

821
00:51:17.36 --> 00:51:20.64
Napoleon going for peace, 20 years of war.

822
00:51:20.64 --> 00:51:26.36
The pursuit never led to the goal but only to spreading exhaustion and ultimate collapse.

823
00:51:26.36 --> 00:51:34.24
The bankruptcy of the Napoleonic Empire renewed a lesson that had often been taught before.

824
00:51:34.24 --> 00:51:38.92
The impression however came to be obscured by the sunset haze of the Napoleonic myth,

825
00:51:38.92 --> 00:51:44.64
the lesson had been forgotten by the time it was repeated in the war of war 1.

826
00:51:44.64 --> 00:51:54.72
Even after that bitter experience, the statement of the second world war were no wiser.

827
00:51:54.72 --> 00:52:00.04
Although war is contrary to reason, since it is a mean of deciding issues by force when

828
00:52:00.04 --> 00:52:06.16
discussion fails to produce an agreed solution, the conduct of war must be controlled by

829
00:52:06.16 --> 00:52:10.16
reason if its object is to be fulfilled.

830
00:52:10.16 --> 00:52:17.20
Here he goes into how we reasonably conduct war.

831
00:52:17.20 --> 00:52:18.20
1.

832
00:52:18.20 --> 00:52:23.24
While fighting is a physical act, its direction is a mental process.

833
00:52:23.24 --> 00:52:27.80
The better your strategy, the easier you will gain the upper hand and the less it will

834
00:52:27.80 --> 00:52:31.40
cost you.

835
00:52:31.40 --> 00:52:34.92
Very important thing to think about.

836
00:52:34.92 --> 00:52:35.92
2.

837
00:52:35.92 --> 00:52:41.92
Conversely, the more strength you waste, the more you increase the risk of the scales of war

838
00:52:41.92 --> 00:52:44.000
turning against you.

839
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:54.36
Even if you succeed in winning victory, the less strength you will have to profit by peace.

840
00:52:54.36 --> 00:52:56.88
Just apply that one to World War 1.

841
00:52:56.88 --> 00:52:59.44
And its like, okay, we didn't stop this.

842
00:52:59.44 --> 00:53:00.44
3.

843
00:53:00.44 --> 00:53:06.64
The more brutal your methods, the more bitter you will make your opponents with the natural

844
00:53:06.64 --> 00:53:11.44
result of hardening the resistance you are trying to overcome.

845
00:53:11.44 --> 00:53:16.92
Plus, the more evenly the two sides are matched, the wiser it will be to avoid extremes

846
00:53:16.92 --> 00:53:23.56
of violence which tend to consolidate the enemies troops and people behind their leaders.

847
00:53:23.56 --> 00:53:28.28
I mean, okay, war, yeah, what about leadership perspective on that one?

848
00:53:28.28 --> 00:53:33.52
No, like the more brutal, the more you shut up they even do and I told you to do.

849
00:53:33.52 --> 00:53:34.88
Shut up team, this is what we're doing.

850
00:53:34.88 --> 00:53:41.40
The more you do that, the more resistance you're going to have to overcome.

851
00:53:41.40 --> 00:53:42.40
4.

852
00:53:42.40 --> 00:53:46.84
These calculations extend further.

853
00:53:46.84 --> 00:53:56.76
The more intent you appear to impose a peace entirely of your own choosing by conquest

854
00:53:56.76 --> 00:54:03.04
the stiffer, the obstacle you will raise in your path.

855
00:54:03.04 --> 00:54:08.44
So when I make a peace that's completely, you know, in my favor, cool, I'm going to end

856
00:54:08.44 --> 00:54:09.76
up with problems.

857
00:54:09.76 --> 00:54:13.96
And the more I impose a plan on Dave and his team, the more I'm going to end up with

858
00:54:13.96 --> 00:54:17.92
problems.

859
00:54:17.92 --> 00:54:24.68
And I can see the looks on the people's faces in a company when I tell them that.

860
00:54:24.68 --> 00:54:26.68
It's so hard to believe.

861
00:54:26.68 --> 00:54:29.52
It's so hard to believe that, hey, actually the more efficient way is to say, hey, Dave,

862
00:54:29.52 --> 00:54:31.76
how do you want to do this?

863
00:54:31.76 --> 00:54:35.32
It's so hard to believe that.

864
00:54:35.32 --> 00:54:37.96
It seems so much more efficient for me to say, hey, Dave, here's the plan.

865
00:54:37.96 --> 00:54:39.52
Shut up and do it.

866
00:54:39.52 --> 00:54:40.52
They're going to hear, give this to your team.

867
00:54:40.52 --> 00:54:41.52
Here's the order.

868
00:54:41.52 --> 00:54:46.08
Let's go execute.

869
00:54:46.08 --> 00:54:50.16
Which is funny, because people go, oh, you know, these military, these military wave leading

870
00:54:50.16 --> 00:54:51.88
wouldn't work in the civilian world.

871
00:54:51.88 --> 00:54:53.72
It's like, what are you talking about?

872
00:54:53.72 --> 00:54:54.72
It's always fun.

873
00:54:54.72 --> 00:54:57.28
Life's like, yeah, yeah, this is what exactly what Jockel did with me.

874
00:54:57.28 --> 00:54:58.28
He'd be like, hey, how do you want to do it?

875
00:54:58.28 --> 00:54:59.28
And I'd be like, how does this sound?

876
00:54:59.28 --> 00:55:00.28
I think we'd plan on this.

877
00:55:00.28 --> 00:55:02.28
Okay, cool.

878
00:55:02.28 --> 00:55:14.04
Five, furthermore, if and when you reach your military goal, the more you ask of the defeated

879
00:55:14.04 --> 00:55:16.84
side, the more trouble you will have.

880
00:55:16.84 --> 00:55:21.36
And the more cause you will have to provide for an ultimate attempt to reverse the settlement

881
00:55:21.36 --> 00:55:23.32
achieved by war.

882
00:55:23.32 --> 00:55:29.68
Again, when you impose your plan on people, when you impose your will on people, there

883
00:55:29.68 --> 00:55:37.76
will be Oregon rejection of that.

884
00:55:37.76 --> 00:55:45.36
Force is a vicious cycle or rather a spiral unless its application is controlled by the

885
00:55:45.36 --> 00:55:50.72
most carefully seasoned calculation.

886
00:55:50.72 --> 00:55:51.72
Just think about that.

887
00:55:51.72 --> 00:55:54.000
Is it common thing I tell clients?

888
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.72
You want to lead with minimum force required.

889
00:55:55.72 --> 00:55:56.72
Tell you want to lead.

890
00:55:56.72 --> 00:55:58.44
If I don't have to say anything that's the best.

891
00:55:58.44 --> 00:56:01.12
If I have to say, hey, this is maybe an idea.

892
00:56:01.12 --> 00:56:03.92
If I get to a point where I have to bark in order to someone and tell them, shut up and

893
00:56:03.92 --> 00:56:05.44
do what I told you to do, that's bad.

894
00:56:05.44 --> 00:56:08.12
That's the vicious circle of force.

895
00:56:08.12 --> 00:56:10.68
We don't like it.

896
00:56:10.68 --> 00:56:18.000
Thus war, which begins by denying reason, comes to vindicated, vindicated throughout all

897
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.04
phases of the struggle.

898
00:56:22.04 --> 00:56:27.80
The fighting instinct is necessary to success in the battlefield.

899
00:56:27.80 --> 00:56:38.80
Although even here, the combatant who can keep a cool head has an advantage over the man

900
00:56:38.80 --> 00:56:43.48
who sees red.

901
00:56:43.48 --> 00:56:45.20
That's his little caveat.

902
00:56:45.20 --> 00:56:52.16
He says, but the fighting instinct should always be written on a tight reign.

903
00:56:52.16 --> 00:56:57.72
The statesman who gives that instinct, it's head loses his own.

904
00:56:57.72 --> 00:57:00.68
If you just want to scrap cool, guess what's going to happen?

905
00:57:00.68 --> 00:57:02.52
You're going to lose your own head.

906
00:57:02.52 --> 00:57:10.28
He's not fit to take charge of the fate of a nation.

907
00:57:10.28 --> 00:57:16.52
Victory in the true sense implies that the state of peace and of one's people is better

908
00:57:16.52 --> 00:57:20.24
after the war than before.

909
00:57:20.24 --> 00:57:24.72
The only thing in this sense is only possible if a quick result can be gained or if a

910
00:57:24.72 --> 00:57:29.28
long effort can be economically proportioned to the national resources.

911
00:57:29.28 --> 00:57:32.40
How much are you investing?

912
00:57:32.40 --> 00:57:35.16
How much are you investing of capital from your company?

913
00:57:35.16 --> 00:57:39.92
How much are you investing in leadership capital?

914
00:57:39.92 --> 00:57:42.32
ROI, where's it at?

915
00:57:42.32 --> 00:57:46.80
The end must be adjusted to the means.

916
00:57:46.80 --> 00:57:49.36
We throw that one out all the time.

917
00:57:49.36 --> 00:57:54.44
And it's got the connotations of being a whim.

918
00:57:54.44 --> 00:57:55.68
Focus on your goal.

919
00:57:55.68 --> 00:58:08.28
There's 48 freaking inspirational memes a day set your goal and never fear from it.

920
00:58:08.28 --> 00:58:09.28
Cool.

921
00:58:09.28 --> 00:58:10.28
I got a better idea.

922
00:58:10.28 --> 00:58:14.28
How about the end must be adjusted to the means?

923
00:58:14.28 --> 00:58:15.28
Right?

924
00:58:15.28 --> 00:58:19.72
I want that Lambo.

925
00:58:19.72 --> 00:58:20.72
I want a dream board.

926
00:58:20.72 --> 00:58:25.96
I got a Lambo and I got an infinity pool.

927
00:58:25.96 --> 00:58:26.96
Cool.

928
00:58:26.96 --> 00:58:31.92
How's that Wendy's salary kicking in?

929
00:58:31.92 --> 00:58:32.92
Right?

930
00:58:32.92 --> 00:58:35.12
Adjust your means a little bit, man.

931
00:58:35.12 --> 00:58:37.60
Adjust the end to fit the means.

932
00:58:37.60 --> 00:58:38.60
Sure.

933
00:58:38.60 --> 00:58:40.60
Oh, this is again.

934
00:58:40.60 --> 00:58:45.000
No one's there's no there's no there's not one single inspirational

935
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:50.68
meme on the gram that says that says the end must be adjusted to the means.

936
00:58:50.68 --> 00:58:51.68
No one says that.

937
00:58:51.68 --> 00:58:52.96
Actually it's the opposite.

938
00:58:52.96 --> 00:58:56.76
It's far as in the inspirational quotes industry.

939
00:58:56.76 --> 00:58:58.76
Well, for lack of a better job.

940
00:58:58.76 --> 00:58:59.76
It's the exact opposite.

941
00:58:59.76 --> 00:59:00.76
Actually, yeah, yeah.

942
00:59:00.76 --> 00:59:02.88
It's like, hey, basically it's like a kid.

943
00:59:02.88 --> 00:59:04.16
Adjust the means to the means.

944
00:59:04.16 --> 00:59:05.16
Or the incident means.

945
00:59:05.16 --> 00:59:11.36
So it's kind of like, hey, don't freaking have this goal that's unrealistic essentially.

946
00:59:11.36 --> 00:59:12.36
Essentially.

947
00:59:12.36 --> 00:59:15.60
Like, it's unrealistic, right?

948
00:59:15.60 --> 00:59:16.60
It's irresponsible.

949
00:59:16.60 --> 00:59:17.60
It's irresponsible.

950
00:59:17.60 --> 00:59:18.84
You have an irresponsible goal right there.

951
00:59:18.84 --> 00:59:21.32
You can like whatever kill yourself doing it.

952
00:59:21.32 --> 00:59:25.92
You should go in the comment should be like your dumb should be right given

953
00:59:25.92 --> 00:59:26.92
that.

954
00:59:26.92 --> 00:59:27.92
Right?

955
00:59:27.92 --> 00:59:28.92
But they'll talk about it.

956
00:59:28.92 --> 00:59:30.72
There's someone right now that's going to hear this bill.

957
00:59:30.72 --> 00:59:31.72
I'm just going to bullshit.

958
00:59:31.72 --> 00:59:32.72
I'm just going to shit.

959
00:59:32.72 --> 00:59:33.72
Yeah.

960
00:59:33.72 --> 00:59:34.72
I'm going to shit you.

961
00:59:34.72 --> 00:59:35.72
You're dead.

962
00:59:35.72 --> 00:59:36.72
Oh, yeah.

963
00:59:36.72 --> 00:59:38.96
If you're down for the thing and I get it because I'm all tap.

964
00:59:38.96 --> 00:59:44.20
Well, heart like if you want to be a bit, you know, for your first 100 million.

965
00:59:44.20 --> 00:59:45.20
Oh yeah.

966
00:59:45.20 --> 00:59:46.20
Yeah.

967
00:59:46.20 --> 00:59:47.80
There's people that tap that twice.

968
00:59:47.80 --> 00:59:48.80
Oh yeah.

969
00:59:48.80 --> 00:59:49.80
Right?

970
00:59:49.80 --> 00:59:50.80
100% yes or in.

971
00:59:50.80 --> 00:59:53.28
And like for a moment, they're kind of like pumped.

972
00:59:53.28 --> 00:59:56.56
Yeah, I'm sure they're pumped the whole time.

973
00:59:56.56 --> 00:59:57.56
You tell the end.

974
00:59:57.56 --> 00:59:59.20
It's really, but no.

975
00:59:59.20 --> 01:00:03.88
Well, if you're the guy, if you're the guy who says this, what this book is saying, hey,

976
01:00:03.88 --> 01:00:05.60
like the end must be adjusted to the means.

977
01:00:05.60 --> 01:00:06.60
That's a good goal.

978
01:00:06.60 --> 01:00:07.88
Like that's a lofty goal.

979
01:00:07.88 --> 01:00:11.08
Which, you know, obviously I can't hate unlofty goals.

980
01:00:11.08 --> 01:00:12.80
Wait, that's not even really a lofty goal.

981
01:00:12.80 --> 01:00:14.92
That's just a realistic thing to do as a human.

982
01:00:14.92 --> 01:00:18.04
But the realistic human means.

983
01:00:18.04 --> 01:00:19.04
Yeah.

984
01:00:19.04 --> 01:00:22.36
Well, you know, the first one will be the end must be adjusted to the means.

985
01:00:22.36 --> 01:00:24.08
It's very not inspirational.

986
01:00:24.08 --> 01:00:25.36
They would get downvoted.

987
01:00:25.36 --> 01:00:26.36
Yeah.

988
01:00:26.36 --> 01:00:28.32
You'll be branded as the hate or really.

989
01:00:28.32 --> 01:00:29.32
Oh.

990
01:00:29.32 --> 01:00:31.60
Like that's the point where they, they'll brand you as a hate.

991
01:00:31.60 --> 01:00:32.88
It's like everyone's always hating.

992
01:00:32.88 --> 01:00:36.80
And you know where this goes into the whole idea.

993
01:00:36.80 --> 01:00:42.32
You're talking about of like, about hey, this isn't really sexy.

994
01:00:42.32 --> 01:00:46.000
This is the absolute like, non, this is getting downvoted.

995
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
This is getting haters.

996
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Oh yeah.

997
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.56
And what's interesting is who you're going to, who's going to get the up vote, right?

998
01:00:54.56 --> 01:00:56.96
This person is getting, you're getting hated all.

999
01:00:56.96 --> 01:00:57.96
Oh yeah.

1000
01:00:57.96 --> 01:00:59.24
Because you're like, actually, it's an unrealistic goal.

1001
01:00:59.24 --> 01:01:00.24
You should check yourself.

1002
01:01:00.24 --> 01:01:01.24
Right.

1003
01:01:01.24 --> 01:01:02.24
All the downer, the doubter, right?

1004
01:01:02.24 --> 01:01:03.24
Oh yeah.

1005
01:01:03.24 --> 01:01:04.24
The doubter.

1006
01:01:04.24 --> 01:01:05.24
Yeah.

1007
01:01:05.24 --> 01:01:06.24
And the thing is that get it.

1008
01:01:06.24 --> 01:01:09.80
Because everyone's in a great while you'll get someone who achieved this super lofty

1009
01:01:09.80 --> 01:01:12.84
goal, not to say that they didn't just the ends to the means.

1010
01:01:12.84 --> 01:01:16.68
Because they had the means up, currently at the end of the day, the means were there.

1011
01:01:16.68 --> 01:01:18.72
Because they end is there to run.

1012
01:01:18.72 --> 01:01:24.68
But he was the thing they had that un, un, un, un, un, un, un, un, un inspirational names.

1013
01:01:24.68 --> 01:01:26.48
We'll just say realistic realistic means.

1014
01:01:26.48 --> 01:01:27.48
Yeah.

1015
01:01:27.48 --> 01:01:34.32
But unless they, they achieved that goal that was kind of untyp, not typically realistic.

1016
01:01:34.32 --> 01:01:35.80
It's unrealistic, right?

1017
01:01:35.80 --> 01:01:38.04
Compared to we speaking to whatever.

1018
01:01:38.04 --> 01:01:40.24
And they achieved it.

1019
01:01:40.24 --> 01:01:46.92
I mean, we could easily argue that like, oh, this person did this because they had

1020
01:01:46.92 --> 01:01:47.92
the mean.

1021
01:01:47.92 --> 01:01:48.92
The means, right?

1022
01:01:48.92 --> 01:01:50.56
That had the intellectual horsepower.

1023
01:01:50.56 --> 01:01:52.84
They had the educational thing.

1024
01:01:52.84 --> 01:01:54.24
They had the how always things set up.

1025
01:01:54.24 --> 01:01:55.84
Oh, it's actually a realistic goal.

1026
01:01:55.84 --> 01:01:56.84
I know that.

1027
01:01:56.84 --> 01:01:57.84
That's what I'm saying.

1028
01:01:57.84 --> 01:01:58.84
Where.

1029
01:01:58.84 --> 01:02:04.56
But they'll take the, the crazy quantum, quote, unrealistic ends, right?

1030
01:02:04.56 --> 01:02:05.56
The goal will say.

1031
01:02:05.56 --> 01:02:06.56
But that's the one, right?

1032
01:02:06.56 --> 01:02:08.56
The classic president of the United States.

1033
01:02:08.56 --> 01:02:09.56
You can do anything you want.

1034
01:02:09.56 --> 01:02:12.56
I'm going to send my goal the highest I possibly can in life, president of the United

1035
01:02:12.56 --> 01:02:13.56
States.

1036
01:02:13.56 --> 01:02:14.56
Right?

1037
01:02:14.56 --> 01:02:16.44
So it'll be like, all right, cool.

1038
01:02:16.44 --> 01:02:21.88
Therefore, we should all essentially set goals as high as president of the United States.

1039
01:02:21.88 --> 01:02:22.88
Right?

1040
01:02:22.88 --> 01:02:23.88
Okay.

1041
01:02:23.88 --> 01:02:26.12
That's kind of the inspirational message, right?

1042
01:02:26.12 --> 01:02:27.12
Okay.

1043
01:02:27.12 --> 01:02:31.56
Meanwhile, the very few individuals that became president of the United States had

1044
01:02:31.56 --> 01:02:33.60
the means.

1045
01:02:33.60 --> 01:02:38.72
So they're ends technically by definition, we're adjusted.

1046
01:02:38.72 --> 01:02:41.56
Their ends were adjusted to the means because they had the means.

1047
01:02:41.56 --> 01:02:42.56
It's the same.

1048
01:02:42.56 --> 01:02:43.56
Not everyone has the means.

1049
01:02:43.56 --> 01:02:45.12
So you've got to adjust those.

1050
01:02:45.12 --> 01:02:46.12
Yeah.

1051
01:02:46.12 --> 01:02:48.16
Meanwhile, everyone's saying new, new, new, new, new, new.

1052
01:02:48.16 --> 01:02:51.36
Don't if you can do it, I can do it too, right?

1053
01:02:51.36 --> 01:02:53.40
Which, hey, I'm not saying they can't.

1054
01:02:53.40 --> 01:02:54.68
I'm not even saying that.

1055
01:02:54.68 --> 01:02:57.80
But I'm saying, hey, man, you've got to be realistic.

1056
01:02:57.80 --> 01:02:59.36
Realistic on that can stuff.

1057
01:02:59.36 --> 01:03:00.36
Yeah.

1058
01:03:00.36 --> 01:03:01.36
Same saying.

1059
01:03:01.36 --> 01:03:03.64
If you say that, you just can't say that.

1060
01:03:03.64 --> 01:03:08.40
You know what's really crazy is like, I just got slapped in my own face thinking about

1061
01:03:08.40 --> 01:03:12.000
this because we're kind of joking about this.

1062
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:20.60
But what he's saying and what he saw was hundreds and hundreds of thousands of soldiers

1063
01:03:20.60 --> 01:03:26.84
that were killed because the leadership didn't adjust the ends to the means.

1064
01:03:26.84 --> 01:03:27.84
Totally.

1065
01:03:27.84 --> 01:03:29.56
Which is crazy to think about.

1066
01:03:29.56 --> 01:03:34.32
As you guys are talking, I was thinking my mind, like, people have figured this out.

1067
01:03:34.32 --> 01:03:36.24
There are even phrases out there.

1068
01:03:36.24 --> 01:03:41.24
The one I kept thinking of as you're talking about this is I remember the phrase, live

1069
01:03:41.24 --> 01:03:42.84
within your means.

1070
01:03:42.84 --> 01:03:45.08
Like, I've heard that's a phrase.

1071
01:03:45.08 --> 01:03:50.08
What it's not is it's not hanging on a poster in any kid's bedroom anywhere.

1072
01:03:50.08 --> 01:03:51.72
Like, I don't go to bed tonight.

1073
01:03:51.72 --> 01:03:52.72
Like it's an unreal going.

1074
01:03:52.72 --> 01:03:55.96
I'm going to live within my means.

1075
01:03:55.96 --> 01:04:01.08
The irony inside that is the best way to actually, ultimately expand your means over

1076
01:04:01.08 --> 01:04:04.08
time so your means get greater and greater is to do exactly that.

1077
01:04:04.08 --> 01:04:13.04
Like, that's the trick to it is the dissatisfaction of the reality is something people overlook.

1078
01:04:13.04 --> 01:04:19.20
And the the unfunny part of that, which is the sobering piece that you just mentioned is that

1079
01:04:19.20 --> 01:04:24.92
it can actually lead people down a path to do exactly what you just said.

1080
01:04:24.92 --> 01:04:31.84
Which, which almost seems not possible except for the fact that these that he specifically

1081
01:04:31.84 --> 01:04:36.72
live that in a way that is, what are we doing here?

1082
01:04:36.72 --> 01:04:37.72
What are we doing?

1083
01:04:37.72 --> 01:04:41.84
What are we expanding to a and what are we accomplishing by doing that?

1084
01:04:41.84 --> 01:04:44.52
So it wasn't just the national exhaustion.

1085
01:04:44.52 --> 01:04:47.92
It was the national exhaustion with nothing to show for it.

1086
01:04:47.92 --> 01:04:53.76
And then the scale of that, which is, which is impossible as opposed to, hey, why don't

1087
01:04:53.76 --> 01:04:55.32
we operate within our means here?

1088
01:04:55.32 --> 01:04:56.32
Why don't we do that?

1089
01:04:56.32 --> 01:04:57.32
Yeah.

1090
01:04:57.32 --> 01:05:01.04
And if you fast forward the kid, if there was a kid that had a post on a wall that

1091
01:05:01.04 --> 01:05:05.80
certainly lived within your means and therefore they're saving and they're putting together.

1092
01:05:05.80 --> 01:05:09.48
And you look at them in 20 years and they're in a way better position than something

1093
01:05:09.48 --> 01:05:14.88
that was like, you know, you need the Lambo for whatever.

1094
01:05:14.88 --> 01:05:15.88
Right?

1095
01:05:15.88 --> 01:05:20.000
Because they're going to end up in debt and they can't invest properly.

1096
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.28
And they have to work a job that they don't really like and it's a job that's a dead

1097
01:05:24.28 --> 01:05:25.28
end job.

1098
01:05:25.28 --> 01:05:27.12
I like all these things add up.

1099
01:05:27.12 --> 01:05:31.20
You said something about you being an NBA basketball player.

1100
01:05:31.20 --> 01:05:37.68
I would say on record, on a inspirational or demotivational post saying, hey, bro, that's

1101
01:05:37.68 --> 01:05:38.68
unrealistic.

1102
01:05:38.68 --> 01:05:40.32
I would tell you that.

1103
01:05:40.32 --> 01:05:45.52
And I think factually it is under, well, just as factually goes, it is unrealistic.

1104
01:05:45.52 --> 01:05:51.12
I don't know that I would tell a high school kid that when he's really into basketball.

1105
01:05:51.12 --> 01:05:54.48
I don't know if I would say that.

1106
01:05:54.48 --> 01:05:58.20
It'd be unrealistic in certain ways, like if the underserved circumstances or whatever,

1107
01:05:58.20 --> 01:06:02.72
but given how you consider it most people how they get into professional sports whenever

1108
01:06:02.72 --> 01:06:05.40
they work hard, they really love the sport.

1109
01:06:05.40 --> 01:06:09.88
They go through trials and tribulations or whatever and they end up making it kind of a thing.

1110
01:06:09.88 --> 01:06:14.64
So if you get someone that's kind of in the beginning of that type of path where that

1111
01:06:14.64 --> 01:06:18.72
path is not straight up blocked off or whatever reason, like it would be in your case,

1112
01:06:18.72 --> 01:06:20.96
I wouldn't really say that's unrealistic.

1113
01:06:20.96 --> 01:06:26.000
The point is there are really cases where it's unrealistic.

1114
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:33.32
So if you tried to be an NBA player, hired the best coach in the world, I get it.

1115
01:06:33.32 --> 01:06:37.12
You would wind up exhausting all your research.

1116
01:06:37.12 --> 01:06:38.72
I should adjust my end.

1117
01:06:38.72 --> 01:06:41.32
I'm going to answer.

1118
01:06:41.32 --> 01:06:46.08
You might want to make sure that you're a kid who you don't want to stifle that dream,

1119
01:06:46.08 --> 01:06:49.68
you might want to make sure that they're not putting all the rags in that one basket

1120
01:06:49.68 --> 01:06:50.68
and two.

1121
01:06:50.68 --> 01:06:52.92
Hey, listen, go for it.

1122
01:06:52.92 --> 01:06:55.32
But you're not going to drop out of school.

1123
01:06:55.32 --> 01:07:03.84
You're not going to stop doing this in this with the ultimate meme of focus on your goals

1124
01:07:03.84 --> 01:07:05.64
and block out every distraction.

1125
01:07:05.64 --> 01:07:08.36
So I'm done with school because school is stupid because school ain't going to help

1126
01:07:08.36 --> 01:07:09.64
me be an NBA player.

1127
01:07:09.64 --> 01:07:13.32
Meanwhile, you're five, six, you're done growing.

1128
01:07:13.32 --> 01:07:16.84
You're not that good of a shot, but you've got this passion.

1129
01:07:16.84 --> 01:07:19.28
You might want to keep that kid on the track of, hey, cool.

1130
01:07:19.28 --> 01:07:20.56
I'm out here to crush your dreams.

1131
01:07:20.56 --> 01:07:24.04
However, comma, let's consider some other things as you're doing that.

1132
01:07:24.04 --> 01:07:25.72
Actually, you should never have a plan B.

1133
01:07:25.72 --> 01:07:27.72
That means you're not fully committed to a plan B.

1134
01:07:27.72 --> 01:07:28.72
That's right.

1135
01:07:28.72 --> 01:07:29.72
You've got a plan B.

1136
01:07:29.72 --> 01:07:30.72
I guess you're not committed to planning.

1137
01:07:30.72 --> 01:07:32.20
There's inspirational meme for you.

1138
01:07:32.20 --> 01:07:35.20
Actually, he addresses some of this here.

1139
01:07:35.20 --> 01:07:38.76
Going back to the book, failing a fair prospect of such a victory.

1140
01:07:38.76 --> 01:07:42.56
So the end must be adjusted to me as failing a fair prospect of such a victory.

1141
01:07:42.56 --> 01:07:47.72
Why statesmanship will miss no opportunity for negotiating peace.

1142
01:07:47.72 --> 01:07:53.48
Peace through stalemate based on a coincident recognition by each side of the opponent's

1143
01:07:53.48 --> 01:07:59.12
strength is at least preferable to peace through common exhaustion and has often provided

1144
01:07:59.12 --> 01:08:03.68
a better foundation for lasting peace.

1145
01:08:03.68 --> 01:08:10.96
It is wiser to run risks of war for the sake of preserving peace than to risk run the

1146
01:08:10.96 --> 01:08:17.12
risk of exhaustion in war for the sake of finishing with victory.

1147
01:08:17.12 --> 01:08:25.36
A conclusion that runs counter to custom but is supported by experience.

1148
01:08:25.36 --> 01:08:31.56
So it's better to like, maybe we don't have war and we just kind of maintain peace with

1149
01:08:31.56 --> 01:08:33.64
kind of what I've got.

1150
01:08:33.64 --> 01:08:35.92
That's a better deal than you know what.

1151
01:08:35.92 --> 01:08:43.36
We're just going to exhaust ourselves and hope for some kind of a victory.

1152
01:08:43.36 --> 01:08:51.52
Perseverance in war is only justifiable if there is a good chance of a good end.

1153
01:08:51.52 --> 01:08:58.80
The prospect of a peace that will balance the sum of human misery incurred in the struggle.

1154
01:08:58.80 --> 01:09:04.08
Like each one of these statements, Dave, you just shake your head knowing where it came from.

1155
01:09:04.08 --> 01:09:08.80
That's all I'm thinking is every one of these is what he, what this comes from, it's

1156
01:09:08.80 --> 01:09:14.08
just how savage that experience had it with been for him.

1157
01:09:14.08 --> 01:09:19.04
Indeed, deepening the study of past experience leads to the conclusion that nations might

1158
01:09:19.04 --> 01:09:23.88
often have come nearer to their object by taking advantage of a low in the struggle to

1159
01:09:23.88 --> 01:09:30.12
discuss a settlement than by pursuing the war with the aim of victory.

1160
01:09:30.12 --> 01:09:33.52
History, so look man, you got to look for those opportunities.

1161
01:09:33.52 --> 01:09:38.40
We have a little low, hey, you want to keep going with us, or you want to maybe stand down.

1162
01:09:38.40 --> 01:09:42.36
History reveals also that in many cases a beneficial peace could have been obtained if

1163
01:09:42.36 --> 01:09:47.80
the statesmen of the warring nations had shown more understanding of the elements of psychology

1164
01:09:47.80 --> 01:09:49.76
and their peace feelers.

1165
01:09:49.76 --> 01:09:53.24
So you get the peace feelers out there like, what?

1166
01:09:53.24 --> 01:09:56.44
Let me sense about what's happening here.

1167
01:09:56.44 --> 01:09:58.12
And people don't have good understanding of their peace.

1168
01:09:58.12 --> 01:10:02.12
They don't recognize their peace feelers.

1169
01:10:02.12 --> 01:10:09.64
Their attitude is commonly been to akin to that scene in the typical domestic quarry.

1170
01:10:09.64 --> 01:10:10.64
Right?

1171
01:10:10.64 --> 01:10:12.92
So now we've got to fight with our wife.

1172
01:10:12.92 --> 01:10:17.56
Each party is afraid to appear yielding with the result that when one of them shows any

1173
01:10:17.56 --> 01:10:24.80
inclination towards consolation, this is usually expressed in language that is too stiff.

1174
01:10:24.80 --> 01:10:29.16
While the other is apt to be slow to respond partly from pride or or obscency and partly

1175
01:10:29.16 --> 01:10:33.40
from a tendency to interpret such a gesture as a sign of weakness when it may be a sign of

1176
01:10:33.40 --> 01:10:34.96
returning to common sense.

1177
01:10:34.96 --> 01:10:36.44
The classic, right?

1178
01:10:36.44 --> 01:10:38.44
I'm not going to apologize.

1179
01:10:38.44 --> 01:10:40.08
I'm just saying you're sorry.

1180
01:10:40.08 --> 01:10:41.44
Yeah, just saying you're sorry.

1181
01:10:41.44 --> 01:10:42.44
Sorry.

1182
01:10:42.44 --> 01:10:43.44
Don't look weak.

1183
01:10:43.44 --> 01:10:49.76
Thus, the faithful moment of passes and the conflict continues to the common damage.

1184
01:10:49.76 --> 01:10:50.76
Right?

1185
01:10:50.76 --> 01:10:54.72
We are killing ourselves over something that we could easily say, hey, look, I'm sorry,

1186
01:10:54.72 --> 01:10:58.04
it's my fault.

1187
01:10:58.04 --> 01:11:02.68
Rarely does a continuation serve any good purpose where the two parties are bound to

1188
01:11:02.68 --> 01:11:04.52
go on living under the same roof.

1189
01:11:04.52 --> 01:11:09.96
This applies even more to modern war than to domestic conflict since the industrialization

1190
01:11:09.96 --> 01:11:14.08
of nations has made their fortunes inseparable.

1191
01:11:14.08 --> 01:11:19.64
It is the responsibility of statesmanship never to lose sight of the post war prospect

1192
01:11:19.64 --> 01:11:28.44
in chasing the mirage of victory.

1193
01:11:28.44 --> 01:11:33.16
Where two, where the two sides are two evenly matched to offer reasonable chance of early

1194
01:11:33.16 --> 01:11:40.36
success to either the statesman is wise who can learn something from the psychology of strategy.

1195
01:11:40.36 --> 01:11:45.40
It is the elementary principle of strategy that if you find your opponent in a strong position

1196
01:11:45.40 --> 01:11:50.76
costly to force, you should leave him a line of retreat as the quickest way of loosening

1197
01:11:50.76 --> 01:11:51.76
his resistance.

1198
01:11:51.76 --> 01:11:54.76
Get personal way out.

1199
01:11:54.76 --> 01:11:57.72
It should equally be the principal policy, especially in order to provide your opponent

1200
01:11:57.72 --> 01:12:00.56
with a ladder by which he can climb down.

1201
01:12:00.56 --> 01:12:03.76
Get people away out.

1202
01:12:03.76 --> 01:12:06.84
Give your wife away out in that argument.

1203
01:12:06.84 --> 01:12:09.88
Give your subordinate away out in that argument.

1204
01:12:09.88 --> 01:12:12.56
Give your boss away out.

1205
01:12:12.56 --> 01:12:17.68
Don't make them dig in, don't make them fight to the death.

1206
01:12:17.68 --> 01:12:22.32
The question may arise as to whether such conclusions based on the history of war between

1207
01:12:22.32 --> 01:12:28.20
so-called civilized states apply to the conditions inherent in a renewal of the type of purely

1208
01:12:28.20 --> 01:12:35.40
predatory war that was waged by the barbarian assailants of the Roman Empire or the mixed

1209
01:12:35.40 --> 01:12:43.40
religious and predatory war that was pursued by the fanatical followers of Mohammed.

1210
01:12:43.40 --> 01:12:51.24
In such wars, any negotiated peace tends to have in itself even less than the normal

1211
01:12:51.24 --> 01:12:52.72
value.

1212
01:12:52.72 --> 01:12:57.72
It is only two clear from the history that states rarely keep the faith with each other,

1213
01:12:57.72 --> 01:13:04.64
save in so far and so long as their promises seem to them to combine with their interests.

1214
01:13:04.64 --> 01:13:06.96
That's a good thing to note.

1215
01:13:06.96 --> 01:13:10.08
I'm not going to keep any promises if they're not from my benefit.

1216
01:13:10.08 --> 01:13:12.92
That's what history tells us.

1217
01:13:12.92 --> 01:13:19.88
And now we're talking about extremists, whether it's the barbarians attacking the Romans

1218
01:13:19.88 --> 01:13:29.44
or the Islamists attacking the West back in the day.

1219
01:13:29.44 --> 01:13:36.04
The less that a nation has regard for moral obligations, the more it tends to respect

1220
01:13:36.04 --> 01:13:39.52
physical strength, the deterrent power of a force too strong to be challenged with the

1221
01:13:39.52 --> 01:13:40.52
beauty.

1222
01:13:40.52 --> 01:13:44.44
You got somebody that's not going to, you make peace with them, but you don't trust them,

1223
01:13:44.44 --> 01:13:45.44
guess what?

1224
01:13:45.44 --> 01:13:47.12
You better be strong.

1225
01:13:47.12 --> 01:13:55.60
People don't respect the moral obligation they respect strength.

1226
01:13:55.60 --> 01:13:59.44
In the same way, with individuals, it is a matter of common experience that the bully

1227
01:13:59.44 --> 01:14:04.24
type and the Robert type hesitate to assail anyone who approaches their own strength.

1228
01:14:04.24 --> 01:14:05.24
Check.

1229
01:14:05.24 --> 01:14:14.40
You don't see the bully picking on the big yoke-dupe guy with cauliflower ears.

1230
01:14:14.40 --> 01:14:18.40
It is folly to imagine that the aggressive types of weather individuals or nations can

1231
01:14:18.40 --> 01:14:25.84
be bought off or in modern language appeased since the payment of dangheld simulates

1232
01:14:25.84 --> 01:14:28.96
a demand for more dangheld.

1233
01:14:28.96 --> 01:14:31.000
What's dangheld you asked?

1234
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.64
It's Viking protection money.

1235
01:14:34.64 --> 01:14:36.48
Like hey, you can live here.

1236
01:14:36.48 --> 01:14:37.48
I need some dangheld.

1237
01:14:37.48 --> 01:14:41.24
You got to pay me a little bit of something.

1238
01:14:41.24 --> 01:14:43.000
And what does that do?

1239
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Makes me want more.

1240
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Oh, the Viking?

1241
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Yeah.

1242
01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.24
But dang, I need some protection money from you.

1243
01:14:50.24 --> 01:14:54.64
You can work this corner, but you got to give me my cut.

1244
01:14:54.64 --> 01:14:58.000
What does that make me want more cut?

1245
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.52
So you can't buy them off.

1246
01:15:01.52 --> 01:15:02.76
But they can be curb.

1247
01:15:02.76 --> 01:15:07.72
They're very belief in force makes it more susceptible to the deterrent effect of a formidable

1248
01:15:07.72 --> 01:15:13.84
opposing force. This forms an adequate check except against pure fanaticism, a fanaticism

1249
01:15:13.84 --> 01:15:17.88
that is unmixed.

1250
01:15:17.88 --> 01:15:21.28
So you get pure fanaticism, it doesn't matter if I'm going to kill you or not.

1251
01:15:21.28 --> 01:15:25.12
You're going to come.

1252
01:15:25.12 --> 01:15:30.76
While it is hard to make real peace with the predatory types, it is easier to induce them

1253
01:15:30.76 --> 01:15:36.24
to accept the state of truth and far less exhausting than an attempt to crush them whereby

1254
01:15:36.24 --> 01:15:42.76
they are like all types of mankind infused with the courage of desperation.

1255
01:15:42.76 --> 01:15:47.000
So we have to be strong.

1256
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.04
You have to be strong.

1257
01:15:50.04 --> 01:15:56.16
And look, if you're stronger than these predatory fanatics, it doesn't necessarily mean

1258
01:15:56.16 --> 01:16:00.32
you want to go to war with them because they're going to fight desperately.

1259
01:16:00.32 --> 01:16:03.84
But if you're strong and you can keep them in check, that's sort of a good balance

1260
01:16:03.84 --> 01:16:08.84
of power that's acceptable.

1261
01:16:08.84 --> 01:16:14.24
I don't know how many more you've got on this, but I'm just thinking of all the things

1262
01:16:14.24 --> 01:16:20.24
he's describing, all the behavior and the reaction, the action and the reaction.

1263
01:16:20.24 --> 01:16:22.44
It's all human nature.

1264
01:16:22.44 --> 01:16:27.36
This is how they will respond to this.

1265
01:16:27.36 --> 01:16:33.60
And the repetitiveness and he keeps coming back to this idea is like, this is not

1266
01:16:33.60 --> 01:16:35.60
a sample size of one.

1267
01:16:35.60 --> 01:16:38.36
This isn't just one thing that's happened in history.

1268
01:16:38.36 --> 01:16:40.92
And I think that's the power of the idea of human nature.

1269
01:16:40.92 --> 01:16:42.68
This is how people will react.

1270
01:16:42.68 --> 01:16:43.68
This is how people will respond.

1271
01:16:43.68 --> 01:16:51.84
And if you understand human nature, that to us is the foundation of leadership.

1272
01:16:51.84 --> 01:16:53.68
This is a human nature endeavor.

1273
01:16:53.68 --> 01:16:57.76
Understanding how people will react.

1274
01:16:57.76 --> 01:17:02.92
And anytime we behave in the extremes, there will be a reaction to that.

1275
01:17:02.92 --> 01:17:07.72
To us operating in the extremes, there will be a natural human reaction to some other

1276
01:17:07.72 --> 01:17:08.72
extreme.

1277
01:17:08.72 --> 01:17:14.56
And the easy, like, hey, you want to subduge human nature, be moderate, limit the natural

1278
01:17:14.56 --> 01:17:15.56
reaction.

1279
01:17:15.56 --> 01:17:18.08
Hey, have a little bit of something over here, have a little something over here, but just

1280
01:17:18.08 --> 01:17:21.96
listening to all the things you're saying is a human nature, human nature, human nature.

1281
01:17:21.96 --> 01:17:22.96
Yeah.

1282
01:17:22.96 --> 01:17:25.48
And the response to be balanced, be balanced, be balanced, be balanced.

1283
01:17:25.48 --> 01:17:30.96
Be defined, be defined, be in the middle to limit to minimize the reaction that you're

1284
01:17:30.96 --> 01:17:35.52
going to get.

1285
01:17:35.52 --> 01:17:36.52
Total war.

1286
01:17:36.52 --> 01:17:37.52
Cool.

1287
01:17:37.52 --> 01:17:38.52
You win.

1288
01:17:38.52 --> 01:17:39.52
Guess what you got now?

1289
01:17:39.52 --> 01:17:40.52
You got an insurgency.

1290
01:17:40.52 --> 01:17:41.52
It's going to last for 20 years.

1291
01:17:41.52 --> 01:17:43.76
And is that really what you want?

1292
01:17:43.76 --> 01:17:47.16
Or could you maybe operate with some restraint understanding that what you're really

1293
01:17:47.16 --> 01:17:48.48
trying to do is not beat them?

1294
01:17:48.48 --> 01:17:52.000
What you're really trying to do is create a piece for a couple of decades, maybe?

1295
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.84
Could you think of the long game here?

1296
01:17:54.84 --> 01:18:00.28
Again, that's probably not going on a post or somewhere.

1297
01:18:00.28 --> 01:18:06.40
So you're not getting recruited into the Marine Corps without one.

1298
01:18:06.40 --> 01:18:12.04
Here's a little warning for us.

1299
01:18:12.04 --> 01:18:17.80
The experience of history brings ample evidence that the downfall of civilized states tends

1300
01:18:17.80 --> 01:18:25.80
to come out from the direct assaults of foes, but from internal decay combined with the consequences

1301
01:18:25.80 --> 01:18:30.56
of exhaustion in war.

1302
01:18:30.56 --> 01:18:34.68
That's a little warning.

1303
01:18:34.68 --> 01:18:40.92
A state of suspense is trying.

1304
01:18:40.92 --> 01:18:45.44
And as usage of the word suspense, there is like mental indecision.

1305
01:18:45.44 --> 01:18:50.28
A state of suspense or mental indecision is trying.

1306
01:18:50.28 --> 01:18:55.56
It is often lead nations as well as individuals to commit suicide because they were

1307
01:18:55.56 --> 01:18:59.000
unable to bear it.

1308
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:07.16
But suspense is better than to reach exhaustion in pursuit of the mirage of victory.

1309
01:19:07.16 --> 01:19:09.52
That's a bold statement.

1310
01:19:09.52 --> 01:19:11.96
So indecision can be so bad.

1311
01:19:11.96 --> 01:19:16.84
This existence of indecision can be so bad that you can destroy yourself.

1312
01:19:16.84 --> 01:19:18.16
You can kill yourself.

1313
01:19:18.16 --> 01:19:22.24
You want to kill yourself.

1314
01:19:22.24 --> 01:19:29.84
But that's actually better than to just exhaust yourself completely in pursuit of a victory

1315
01:19:29.84 --> 01:19:32.40
that can't be had.

1316
01:19:32.40 --> 01:19:41.08
What's counter intuitive about that is this idea that humans, we need to go towards.

1317
01:19:41.08 --> 01:19:42.08
We need to go.

1318
01:19:42.08 --> 01:19:43.08
We need something.

1319
01:19:43.08 --> 01:19:44.08
We want something.

1320
01:19:44.08 --> 01:19:45.08
We want to struggle.

1321
01:19:45.08 --> 01:19:46.88
We want to fight.

1322
01:19:46.88 --> 01:19:51.92
What he's saying here is like, let's think twice about that one.

1323
01:19:51.92 --> 01:20:01.20
And I think it's probably because he understands what the true exhaustion of a state looks

1324
01:20:01.20 --> 01:20:05.000
like.

1325
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.44
On a scale that most people can't comprehend.

1326
01:20:10.44 --> 01:20:16.72
He said this before I remember it, the mirage of victory, the mirage.

1327
01:20:16.72 --> 01:20:20.72
What you are seeing, this goal that you are working towards, it's actually not a thing.

1328
01:20:20.72 --> 01:20:22.72
It's not a real thing, it's a mirage.

1329
01:20:22.72 --> 01:20:26.28
And you've convinced yourself, victory for me is I defeat Jocca.

1330
01:20:26.28 --> 01:20:27.28
That's victory.

1331
01:20:27.28 --> 01:20:30.24
And I am going to move towards that until it happens.

1332
01:20:30.24 --> 01:20:31.64
But that's actually not a real thing.

1333
01:20:31.64 --> 01:20:33.64
It's not a real thing.

1334
01:20:33.64 --> 01:20:34.64
Yeah.

1335
01:20:34.64 --> 01:20:35.64
It's not a real thing.

1336
01:20:35.64 --> 01:20:38.24
And what you'll end up with is an insurgency.

1337
01:20:38.24 --> 01:20:39.24
Or exhaustive.

1338
01:20:39.24 --> 01:20:40.24
Or exhaustive.

1339
01:20:40.24 --> 01:20:41.56
Or whatever else.

1340
01:20:41.56 --> 01:20:44.16
Or you'll rule over the Baron Wasteland that I left.

1341
01:20:44.16 --> 01:20:44.16
Right.

1342
01:20:44.16 --> 01:20:50.68
More over a truce to actual hostility.

1343
01:20:50.68 --> 01:20:57.12
Enables a recovery and development of strength while the need for vigilance keeps a nation

1344
01:20:57.12 --> 01:21:00.92
on its toes.

1345
01:21:00.92 --> 01:21:02.32
So we're looking for a truce.

1346
01:21:02.32 --> 01:21:03.80
It's OK.

1347
01:21:03.80 --> 01:21:09.84
Peaceful nations are apt however to court unnecessary danger because when once aroused, they

1348
01:21:09.84 --> 01:21:16.80
are more inclined to proceed to extremes than predatory nations.

1349
01:21:16.80 --> 01:21:17.80
Interesting.

1350
01:21:17.80 --> 01:21:21.84
This is like the guy that's sort of quiet and keep me to himself.

1351
01:21:21.84 --> 01:21:29.16
But when you piss them off, then they freaking go ham.

1352
01:21:29.16 --> 01:21:32.20
That's a technical definition as well.

1353
01:21:32.20 --> 01:21:37.24
For the latter making war as a means of gain are usually more ready to call it often.

1354
01:21:37.24 --> 01:21:42.12
They find an opponent too strong or too easily overcome.

1355
01:21:42.12 --> 01:21:47.76
And this is really the last point for this book that we're going to talk about.

1356
01:21:47.76 --> 01:21:51.04
It is the reluctant fighter.

1357
01:21:51.04 --> 01:21:58.80
Impheld by emotion and not by calculation who tends to press a fight to the better end.

1358
01:21:58.80 --> 01:22:07.36
thereby he too often defeats his own end even if he does not produce his own direct defeat.

1359
01:22:07.36 --> 01:22:15.52
For the spirit of barbarism can be weakened only during a cessation of hostilities.

1360
01:22:15.52 --> 01:22:23.60
For strengthens it pouring fuel on the flames.

1361
01:22:23.60 --> 01:22:32.80
So by attacking people by attacking the barbarians and we attack them we make them stronger.

1362
01:22:32.80 --> 01:22:37.52
We make them fight harder.

1363
01:22:37.52 --> 01:22:40.08
War makes them stronger.

1364
01:22:40.08 --> 01:22:45.84
Makes them fight, makes them resist, pours fuel on the flames.

1365
01:22:45.84 --> 01:22:50.08
We can only weaken them by backing off a little bit.

1366
01:22:50.08 --> 01:22:52.20
Again, this is not the recruiting poster.

1367
01:22:52.20 --> 01:22:54.20
It's so counterintuitive.

1368
01:22:54.20 --> 01:22:59.80
It's so counterintuitive to the natural reaction of push harder.

1369
01:22:59.80 --> 01:23:07.000
Be more dominant to get the outcome that you want.

1370
01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.84
So we're here for the truce.

1371
01:23:10.84 --> 01:23:13.48
We're here for the compromise.

1372
01:23:13.48 --> 01:23:16.84
It's so counterintuitive to what we preach what we want.

1373
01:23:16.84 --> 01:23:18.48
Which is total victory.

1374
01:23:18.48 --> 01:23:19.48
I like total victory.

1375
01:23:19.48 --> 01:23:20.48
That sounds good.

1376
01:23:20.48 --> 01:23:22.48
It's a morage.

1377
01:23:22.48 --> 01:23:25.64
Just never compromise.

1378
01:23:25.64 --> 01:23:27.64
No compromise.

1379
01:23:27.64 --> 01:23:31.84
That's another great inspirational.

1380
01:23:31.84 --> 01:23:35.88
Because there's none that say, hey, it's really good to compromise oftentimes and kind

1381
01:23:35.88 --> 01:23:38.88
of take what you can get and work out a good deal.

1382
01:23:38.88 --> 01:23:39.88
That's fair.

1383
01:23:39.88 --> 01:23:45.12
We're going to get hammered for this.

1384
01:23:45.12 --> 01:23:49.48
Some inspirational meme people are going to be mad at us.

1385
01:23:49.48 --> 01:23:54.48
What's crazy is you can probably open up a disciplinary freedom field manual.

1386
01:23:54.48 --> 01:23:56.28
We'll pull out some stuff like this.

1387
01:23:56.28 --> 01:23:58.28
I got all kinds of stuff in there.

1388
01:23:58.28 --> 01:24:01.28
Getting crazy.

1389
01:24:01.28 --> 01:24:02.28
Right?

1390
01:24:02.28 --> 01:24:04.28
You're going to make me crack it open and start reading.

1391
01:24:04.28 --> 01:24:05.88
No.

1392
01:24:05.88 --> 01:24:07.48
Guilty as charged.

1393
01:24:07.48 --> 01:24:10.28
I'm kind of wanting to.

1394
01:24:10.28 --> 01:24:15.84
Well, the good thing about your book is that it's not.

1395
01:24:15.84 --> 01:24:22.04
It's not like you've done a good job whether it be in the book itself or compromise.

1396
01:24:22.04 --> 01:24:25.56
Page 32, this is when it goes freedom field manual.

1397
01:24:25.56 --> 01:24:28.92
When working with other people in dynamic, oh, this is see this is kind of cool.

1398
01:24:28.92 --> 01:24:29.92
Here's what it says.

1399
01:24:29.92 --> 01:24:31.60
This is just the first thing I opened up to.

1400
01:24:31.60 --> 01:24:35.60
When working with other people and dynamic situations in relationships and deals, a person,

1401
01:24:35.60 --> 01:24:39.56
especially a leader must compromise.

1402
01:24:39.56 --> 01:24:44.56
Finding the common ground between teams, merging different approaches to the same problem,

1403
01:24:44.56 --> 01:24:50.08
bridging personalities with people who might not get along, reaching agreements in courses

1404
01:24:50.08 --> 01:24:54.20
of action, all of these require compromise.

1405
01:24:54.20 --> 01:24:58.92
And in many cases, a failure to compromise is a failure to succeed.

1406
01:24:58.92 --> 01:25:00.92
I guess maybe I'm wrong.

1407
01:25:00.92 --> 01:25:07.000
I mean, maybe I'm wrong about me writing stuff that's inspirational mean crap.

1408
01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.08
But those are external compromises with other people, other humans that have their own personalities

1409
01:25:12.08 --> 01:25:16.52
and ethos and issues and compromises needed to unify.

1410
01:25:16.52 --> 01:25:19.08
So work with them, compromise.

1411
01:25:19.08 --> 01:25:23.08
So to work with them, compromise is a must.

1412
01:25:23.08 --> 01:25:24.44
Now with yourself.

1413
01:25:24.44 --> 01:25:25.44
And then I wait.

1414
01:25:25.44 --> 01:25:26.96
But internally, it's different.

1415
01:25:26.96 --> 01:25:28.68
With myself, I have to hold the line.

1416
01:25:28.68 --> 01:25:31.56
There are areas within myself where I cannot compromise.

1417
01:25:31.56 --> 01:25:32.92
I'm going to work hard.

1418
01:25:32.92 --> 01:25:33.92
I'm going to train hard.

1419
01:25:33.92 --> 01:25:34.92
I'm going to improve myself.

1420
01:25:34.92 --> 01:25:36.92
I'm not going to rest on my laurels.

1421
01:25:36.92 --> 01:25:39.36
I'm going to confront my own mistakes.

1422
01:25:39.36 --> 01:25:41.60
I'm going to own my mistakes and confront them.

1423
01:25:41.60 --> 01:25:43.40
I'm going to face my demons.

1424
01:25:43.40 --> 01:25:45.92
I'm not going to give up or give out or give in.

1425
01:25:45.92 --> 01:25:47.44
I'm going to stand.

1426
01:25:47.44 --> 01:25:49.72
I'm going to maintain myself discipline.

1427
01:25:49.72 --> 01:25:54.28
And on those points, there will be no compromise, not now, not ever.

1428
01:25:54.28 --> 01:25:55.28
Whoa.

1429
01:25:55.28 --> 01:25:57.68
That's pretty ins pretty pretty.

1430
01:25:57.68 --> 01:26:00.16
We might go meme on that one.

1431
01:26:00.16 --> 01:26:01.16
Sure.

1432
01:26:01.16 --> 01:26:04.60
Yeah, if you go from the headline to the conclusion there and skip the content of the

1433
01:26:04.60 --> 01:26:07.92
middle where it says compromise, not now, not ever.

1434
01:26:07.92 --> 01:26:10.52
You got a little cross with an issue here where you're deciding.

1435
01:26:10.52 --> 01:26:13.16
I was like, I didn't quite read the context.

1436
01:26:13.16 --> 01:26:15.56
But I saw the page that said compromise ended.

1437
01:26:15.56 --> 01:26:18.20
It said not now, not ever.

1438
01:26:18.20 --> 01:26:19.20
Yeah.

1439
01:26:19.20 --> 01:26:23.16
So I think if we go through this book, here's one called fight.

1440
01:26:23.16 --> 01:26:24.60
Go down swinging.

1441
01:26:24.60 --> 01:26:27.64
And I'll tell you, if you fight with all you have more often than not, you won't

1442
01:26:27.64 --> 01:26:28.68
go down at all.

1443
01:26:28.68 --> 01:26:31.000
You will win.

1444
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.16
But you have to make that attitude part of your everyday life.

1445
01:26:34.16 --> 01:26:38.84
Do the extra repetition, run the extra mile, go the extra round, make the right choices,

1446
01:26:38.84 --> 01:26:40.40
give the full measure.

1447
01:26:40.40 --> 01:26:43.52
I'm in the game.

1448
01:26:43.52 --> 01:26:45.76
I think I'm in the inspirational meme game.

1449
01:26:45.76 --> 01:26:49.96
Yeah, you are, but what I was going to say is like, yeah, you do that.

1450
01:26:49.96 --> 01:26:55.52
But the good thing about having a whole book and a whole podcast and eight million other

1451
01:26:55.52 --> 01:27:00.20
books is, or whatever, you're going to explain the whole situation rather than just have

1452
01:27:00.20 --> 01:27:01.20
the one post.

1453
01:27:01.20 --> 01:27:02.20
You see what I'm saying?

1454
01:27:02.20 --> 01:27:03.20
Yeah.

1455
01:27:03.20 --> 01:27:04.76
I mean, look, the entire book is predicate.

1456
01:27:04.76 --> 01:27:09.32
I think the opening salvo you have is, this is about you.

1457
01:27:09.32 --> 01:27:11.04
And you say, I am nothing but weakness.

1458
01:27:11.04 --> 01:27:12.80
I am nothing but but flaws.

1459
01:27:12.80 --> 01:27:13.80
I am nothing but these things.

1460
01:27:13.80 --> 01:27:20.16
So this is the, this is what you are with yourself, with self discipline, as opposed

1461
01:27:20.16 --> 01:27:25.20
to how I'm going to treat other people around me.

1462
01:27:25.20 --> 01:27:27.20
Yes, this is aimed internally.

1463
01:27:27.20 --> 01:27:28.20
Totally.

1464
01:27:28.20 --> 01:27:34.36
I mean, in a literal sense, and that fight is against, I mean, it's even in the video

1465
01:27:34.36 --> 01:27:37.92
that we show it at the most, I am nothing but weakness.

1466
01:27:37.92 --> 01:27:42.08
And I'm going to fight against that weakness, that compromise, all those things that

1467
01:27:42.08 --> 01:27:47.88
might mind me, that's telling me to do to myself, which is, I think also you could look

1468
01:27:47.88 --> 01:27:51.96
in the terms like the difference between imposed discipline and self discipline.

1469
01:27:51.96 --> 01:27:55.12
Imposed discipline does not work and self discipline does.

1470
01:27:55.12 --> 01:27:57.60
That's simple as that.

1471
01:27:57.60 --> 01:28:04.64
And as we impose ourselves on other people, in war, in leadership, in parenting, in insert

1472
01:28:04.64 --> 01:28:08.96
any human interaction, human and another human, when you impose your discipline, when

1473
01:28:08.96 --> 01:28:14.20
you impose yourself on them, in the end you will lose.

1474
01:28:14.20 --> 01:28:16.56
But it's much more efficient just to impose your way.

1475
01:28:16.56 --> 01:28:17.56
Yes, faster.

1476
01:28:17.56 --> 01:28:20.84
Oh, man.

1477
01:28:20.84 --> 01:28:21.84
So there we go.

1478
01:28:21.84 --> 01:28:23.20
That's what we're going to cover for this book.

1479
01:28:23.20 --> 01:28:27.68
That I've kind of, I guess, foreshadowed some of the other things we're doing in the future.

1480
01:28:27.68 --> 01:28:31.04
And it's one of those things.

1481
01:28:31.04 --> 01:28:38.000
If you can take these lessons, these lessons written in blood, not just in one more, but

1482
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:46.84
in war after war, after war, and the exclamation point of World War I, you can learn

1483
01:28:46.84 --> 01:28:54.60
a lot and you can apply this and we know that it's not as striking, we know it's not as sexy,

1484
01:28:54.60 --> 01:29:07.92
we know it's not as mean worthy as some of the more direct approaches.

1485
01:29:07.92 --> 01:29:09.36
We know that.

1486
01:29:09.36 --> 01:29:18.48
But this is to give the original name, this is how to win wars.

1487
01:29:18.48 --> 01:29:27.08
With that speaking of winning wars, echo Charles, we want to win the war on ourselves.

1488
01:29:27.08 --> 01:29:28.08
We do.

1489
01:29:28.08 --> 01:29:35.80
Yeah, that when you say win wars, when wars, you don't tend to, this is one of the

1490
01:29:35.80 --> 01:29:40.24
takeaways that I think, hey dang, that's something good to remember.

1491
01:29:40.24 --> 01:29:44.04
When you think about war fair and winning the war, you don't think about the peace that

1492
01:29:44.04 --> 01:29:46.04
afterwards, like the aftermath.

1493
01:29:46.04 --> 01:29:49.88
So I grew up on quiet.

1494
01:29:49.88 --> 01:29:54.52
So the thing about quiet is like, if you get in a fight with someone and you don't resolve

1495
01:29:54.52 --> 01:29:56.32
it in a peaceful way, I don't care how.

1496
01:29:56.32 --> 01:29:59.80
I don't care if it's kind of, hey, we don't like each other for no good reason and we just

1497
01:29:59.80 --> 01:30:02.60
fight him, okay, we're cool, we fought and we're done.

1498
01:30:02.60 --> 01:30:05.52
If you don't resolve it in some peaceful way, you got to deal with somebody's cousin.

1499
01:30:05.52 --> 01:30:10.48
Somebody's brother, somebody's whoever, neighbor who's just down for the cause or whatever

1500
01:30:10.48 --> 01:30:12.40
and you're gonna see him again too.

1501
01:30:12.40 --> 01:30:13.40
That's the thing.

1502
01:30:13.40 --> 01:30:17.28
You go to the store, he's gonna be there next week or whatever.

1503
01:30:17.28 --> 01:30:19.44
So it's kind of one of those things where it's kind of in the back of your mind.

1504
01:30:19.44 --> 01:30:23.44
If I'm gonna fight this guy, I sort of got to deal with that content with that long,

1505
01:30:23.44 --> 01:30:24.44
that long game.

1506
01:30:24.44 --> 01:30:28.44
Is there a methodology to get that resolved post fight?

1507
01:30:28.44 --> 01:30:30.84
Yeah, I think so.

1508
01:30:30.84 --> 01:30:36.48
I've, all the fights I've ever been in have never been like lasting, like it'd be like

1509
01:30:36.48 --> 01:30:39.16
a fight and then we're friends afterwards.

1510
01:30:39.16 --> 01:30:44.20
But I was a kid, so I had very little understanding of that.

1511
01:30:44.20 --> 01:30:48.24
But nonetheless, the point is where that's something that when we think of warfare, we think

1512
01:30:48.24 --> 01:30:52.04
of, oh, defeat, cross your enemies, having driven before you.

1513
01:30:52.04 --> 01:30:53.04
You seem to say.

1514
01:30:53.04 --> 01:30:55.16
And we don't think about that all the way.

1515
01:30:55.16 --> 01:31:00.08
And you got your neighbor, his freaking dog or whatever, his barking, his tree is growing

1516
01:31:00.08 --> 01:31:02.92
over your fence and you're gonna, you guys are wearing yours.

1517
01:31:02.92 --> 01:31:04.76
It's like, right, you want to do that.

1518
01:31:04.76 --> 01:31:06.52
You know, you got to live next to that guy.

1519
01:31:06.52 --> 01:31:09.64
When you go to the post office or whatever, you go to your car and you see him getting

1520
01:31:09.64 --> 01:31:12.44
his car too, you're like, oh, it's all awkward or whatever.

1521
01:31:12.44 --> 01:31:14.96
Like, right, you don't have to do it like that, you know?

1522
01:31:14.96 --> 01:31:19.80
Are you really going to achieve the peace that you hoped for by beating this dude's ass

1523
01:31:19.80 --> 01:31:20.80
right now?

1524
01:31:20.80 --> 01:31:25.000
Yeah, well, just chances are you're not really, if you think a little bit, chances are you're

1525
01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.56
not thinking, hey, I'm gonna go to the distance right now.

1526
01:31:27.56 --> 01:31:30.16
Like, I'm ready to just go, I'm ready to go all in.

1527
01:31:30.16 --> 01:31:34.68
I'll fight every cousin, nephew, brother, sister.

1528
01:31:34.68 --> 01:31:35.68
I don't care.

1529
01:31:35.68 --> 01:31:37.52
Like, but that's where you can end up.

1530
01:31:37.52 --> 01:31:38.52
Yeah, we want.

1531
01:31:38.52 --> 01:31:39.52
We don't want to end up.

1532
01:31:39.52 --> 01:31:42.36
In fact, that's a common thing, especially like with the neighbors or whatever, I'm

1533
01:31:42.36 --> 01:31:45.32
going to tell him all, it's usually that kind of, I'm going to tell him off.

1534
01:31:45.32 --> 01:31:47.84
I'm not going to take that from him or her, whatever.

1535
01:31:47.84 --> 01:31:52.92
And meanwhile, 10, 20, 30 years you're wearing what this neighbor, right next door by the

1536
01:31:52.92 --> 01:31:53.92
way.

1537
01:31:53.92 --> 01:31:54.92
The feud.

1538
01:31:54.92 --> 01:31:55.92
The feud.

1539
01:31:55.92 --> 01:31:59.20
And then this little, total common thing, you know, when all you got to do is be like,

1540
01:31:59.20 --> 01:32:03.64
hey, make a peaceful discourse.

1541
01:32:03.64 --> 01:32:08.08
And you guys can live neighborly, you seem to say, preferable.

1542
01:32:08.08 --> 01:32:12.08
But anyway, yeah, so the point is, like, thinking about that after math or considering

1543
01:32:12.08 --> 01:32:13.28
that, it's a thing, you know.

1544
01:32:13.28 --> 01:32:15.28
Let's do that.

1545
01:32:15.28 --> 01:32:18.32
Like, if you were always someone in your jitter and you'd fight dirty because you want

1546
01:32:18.32 --> 01:32:19.32
to win.

1547
01:32:19.32 --> 01:32:22.16
And you know, do that stuff then when you're done rolling, you tap them out, hell, yeah.

1548
01:32:22.16 --> 01:32:23.76
Everyone's talking about you.

1549
01:32:23.76 --> 01:32:25.72
You dirty, nobody respects you.

1550
01:32:25.72 --> 01:32:27.42
what he likes, even the community.

1551
01:32:27.42 --> 01:32:28.42
Truth.

1552
01:32:28.42 --> 01:32:29.54
You've got to be careful with that.

1553
01:32:29.54 --> 01:32:31.14
I can still.

1554
01:32:31.14 --> 01:32:32.14
All right.

1555
01:32:32.14 --> 01:32:37.20
So how can we win the war that we're all fighting

1556
01:32:37.20 --> 01:32:40.44
kind of on an individual basis day to day?

1557
01:32:40.44 --> 01:32:44.44
With unmitigated daily discipline in all day.

1558
01:32:44.44 --> 01:32:45.04
I like it.

1559
01:32:45.04 --> 01:32:46.04
I like it.

1560
01:32:46.04 --> 01:32:47.48
So when I say daily discipline,

1561
01:32:47.48 --> 01:32:49.32
I mean the energy drink, boom.

1562
01:32:49.32 --> 01:32:51.56
So it's healthy for you.

1563
01:32:51.56 --> 01:32:53.24
And it gives you the payoff that you

1564
01:32:53.24 --> 01:32:56.12
would expect from an energy drink.

1565
01:32:56.12 --> 01:32:58.08
Same same, so this is good news for us.

1566
01:32:58.08 --> 01:33:00.24
Anyway, so on this path that we're all on,

1567
01:33:00.24 --> 01:33:01.92
we need some supplementation.

1568
01:33:01.92 --> 01:33:04.04
We could benefit from supplementation.

1569
01:33:04.04 --> 01:33:08.88
So we got Choco Fuel to the rescue in a sense.

1570
01:33:08.88 --> 01:33:10.48
It's got energy drinks for you healthy.

1571
01:33:10.48 --> 01:33:12.16
Good short term and long term.

1572
01:33:12.16 --> 01:33:14.92
We got protein, additional protein.

1573
01:33:14.92 --> 01:33:15.72
Taste real good.

1574
01:33:15.72 --> 01:33:17.04
We got dessert, basically.

1575
01:33:17.04 --> 01:33:17.88
dessert.

1576
01:33:17.88 --> 01:33:18.24
That's good for you.

1577
01:33:18.24 --> 01:33:20.76
Yeah, good short term, good long term.

1578
01:33:20.76 --> 01:33:24.48
The aftermath of the bulk of the protein, the dessert.

1579
01:33:24.48 --> 01:33:25.40
It's good out from that.

1580
01:33:25.40 --> 01:33:27.60
That's a peaceful truth.

1581
01:33:27.60 --> 01:33:29.32
It's a peaceful truth.

1582
01:33:29.32 --> 01:33:30.80
Yes, sir.

1583
01:33:30.80 --> 01:33:34.48
Also, when you drink sacked up, when you immunity acts up,

1584
01:33:34.48 --> 01:33:35.76
we got some stuff for that as well.

1585
01:33:35.76 --> 01:33:37.68
How about you don't let your joints act up?

1586
01:33:37.68 --> 01:33:39.72
How about we get into a continual state of peace

1587
01:33:39.72 --> 01:33:40.36
with our joints?

1588
01:33:40.36 --> 01:33:40.84
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1589
01:33:40.84 --> 01:33:41.84
That's what I think.

1590
01:33:41.84 --> 01:33:42.84
That's what I think.

1591
01:33:42.84 --> 01:33:46.000
Because to wait, wait for your joints to act up as a bad call.

1592
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.64
And I was about to say, preemptive strike on your joints.

1593
01:33:48.64 --> 01:33:49.48
Yeah.

1594
01:33:49.48 --> 01:33:51.68
Yeah, I mean, you're like, hey, but a cooperative, you know,

1595
01:33:51.68 --> 01:33:54.28
you're going down like the right path there.

1596
01:33:54.28 --> 01:33:55.52
I'm like preemptive strike.

1597
01:33:55.52 --> 01:33:58.68
Yeah, you see you're joining more for tune with the hang on.

1598
01:33:58.68 --> 01:34:00.96
Marine Corps recording for poster out of the state.

1599
01:34:00.96 --> 01:34:02.44
It is called joint warfare.

1600
01:34:02.44 --> 01:34:03.60
I mean, it's called joint warfare.

1601
01:34:03.60 --> 01:34:08.000
No, but preemptive strike on joint issues.

1602
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.88
So in issues, yeah, you have to beat them down.

1603
01:34:09.88 --> 01:34:10.80
Demand this submission.

1604
01:34:10.80 --> 01:34:11.80
Yes.

1605
01:34:11.80 --> 01:34:16.36
Be inflammation and to submission with joint warfare.

1606
01:34:16.36 --> 01:34:20.80
Don't wait until you have joint issues that's a dumb call.

1607
01:34:20.80 --> 01:34:23.12
That's what echo Charles just told you to do.

1608
01:34:23.12 --> 01:34:25.12
I'm here to help.

1609
01:34:25.12 --> 01:34:29.44
You know, I'm saying, hey, if you don't want to worry about joint issues,

1610
01:34:29.44 --> 01:34:31.68
you take the joint warfare and the super-cruit oil.

1611
01:34:31.68 --> 01:34:32.68
Yes.

1612
01:34:32.68 --> 01:34:33.68
That's it.

1613
01:34:33.68 --> 01:34:38.32
If you don't want to worry about colds or sicknesses or fluees or whatever,

1614
01:34:38.32 --> 01:34:39.48
you take the vitamin D3.

1615
01:34:39.48 --> 01:34:40.28
You take the cold war.

1616
01:34:40.28 --> 01:34:41.28
That's going to help you.

1617
01:34:41.28 --> 01:34:42.28
Yeah.

1618
01:34:42.28 --> 01:34:43.28
Preemptive strike.

1619
01:34:43.28 --> 01:34:44.28
Preemptive strike.

1620
01:34:44.28 --> 01:34:45.28
Go to war.

1621
01:34:45.28 --> 01:34:46.28
Yeah.

1622
01:34:46.28 --> 01:34:47.28
Fully.

1623
01:34:47.28 --> 01:34:50.04
So you can get all the stuff at vitamin Chum.

1624
01:34:50.04 --> 01:34:55.92
You can get all the energy drinks at Wawa and you can get all of everything on Jocca

1625
01:34:55.92 --> 01:34:58.000
Fuel.com.

1626
01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:02.76
And if you look, if you want to save a little bit of money and you want to save brain

1627
01:35:02.76 --> 01:35:05.68
power, get a subscription.

1628
01:35:05.68 --> 01:35:07.000
Get a subscription to whatever you want.

1629
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
It'll show up at your house once a month.

1630
01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.32
Boom, there's the milk, there's the joint warfare, there's the super-cruit oil.

1631
01:35:13.32 --> 01:35:14.32
It's coming in.

1632
01:35:14.32 --> 01:35:16.60
When you're worried about it, you can focus on something else.

1633
01:35:16.60 --> 01:35:19.40
You can prioritize next to you some other tasks.

1634
01:35:19.40 --> 01:35:20.40
Yep.

1635
01:35:20.40 --> 01:35:22.40
Speaking of brain power, origin USA.

1636
01:35:22.40 --> 01:35:24.64
They got some American-made stuff.

1637
01:35:24.64 --> 01:35:25.84
How's that enough to do with brain power?

1638
01:35:25.84 --> 01:35:26.84
Right.

1639
01:35:26.84 --> 01:35:27.84
You know what I'm talking about?

1640
01:35:27.84 --> 01:35:28.84
Don't act like you don't know.

1641
01:35:28.84 --> 01:35:31.72
American-American-made denim is for as jeans go.

1642
01:35:31.72 --> 01:35:35.08
I was going to call you in a couple of those last-pond cast where you know, speaking

1643
01:35:35.08 --> 01:35:36.08
of whatever.

1644
01:35:36.08 --> 01:35:37.56
I'm going to talk about something totally different.

1645
01:35:37.56 --> 01:35:39.20
That's sort of like become your new mode.

1646
01:35:39.20 --> 01:35:41.24
No, yeah, because you got to make the association.

1647
01:35:41.24 --> 01:35:42.24
Same thing.

1648
01:35:42.24 --> 01:35:43.24
Speaking of pickles.

1649
01:35:43.24 --> 01:35:44.24
That's the brain power.

1650
01:35:44.24 --> 01:35:45.24
Origin USA.

1651
01:35:45.24 --> 01:35:48.20
You can get some jeans.

1652
01:35:48.20 --> 01:35:50.20
American-made denim.

1653
01:35:50.20 --> 01:35:51.20
That's a big deal.

1654
01:35:51.20 --> 01:35:55.04
As far as American-made stuff goes, you got the denim, you got your jeans, you got your

1655
01:35:55.04 --> 01:36:01.92
geese rash guards, you got athletic wear, you got belts, you got boots, all made in America

1656
01:36:01.92 --> 01:36:02.92
or a gen USA.

1657
01:36:02.92 --> 01:36:03.92
Boom.

1658
01:36:03.92 --> 01:36:04.92
See?

1659
01:36:04.92 --> 01:36:06.92
See what I'm saying about the brain power?

1660
01:36:06.92 --> 01:36:09.92
Yeah, that was definitely had a lot to do with brain power.

1661
01:36:09.92 --> 01:36:13.20
Also speaking of a lot of brain power, you're expended.

1662
01:36:13.20 --> 01:36:14.20
Making that connection.

1663
01:36:14.20 --> 01:36:15.20
Speaking of ridiculous.

1664
01:36:15.20 --> 01:36:19.20
Speaking of ridiculous, Joko has a store.

1665
01:36:19.20 --> 01:36:20.20
Half a watt.

1666
01:36:20.20 --> 01:36:23.28
It's called Joko Store.

1667
01:36:23.28 --> 01:36:26.32
If you want your discipline equals freedom, shirts.

1668
01:36:26.32 --> 01:36:27.32
Right.

1669
01:36:27.32 --> 01:36:28.32
Merch.

1670
01:36:28.32 --> 01:36:29.32
As far as merch goes.

1671
01:36:29.32 --> 01:36:31.56
You're sure this does good on it.

1672
01:36:31.56 --> 01:36:32.56
Boom, you can get it there.

1673
01:36:32.56 --> 01:36:33.56
You can get all kinds of stuff.

1674
01:36:33.56 --> 01:36:34.56
Uh, hats.

1675
01:36:34.56 --> 01:36:35.56
Sure.

1676
01:36:35.56 --> 01:36:36.56
So that's pretty good.

1677
01:36:36.56 --> 01:36:37.56
These are the cards.

1678
01:36:37.56 --> 01:36:39.12
Still, so the shirt was your heart on it.

1679
01:36:39.12 --> 01:36:41.64
Do you still sell the shirt with your head on it?

1680
01:36:41.64 --> 01:36:42.64
You design that shirt.

1681
01:36:42.64 --> 01:36:44.92
Just still sell that shirt with your head on it.

1682
01:36:44.92 --> 01:36:46.32
Yeah, we still sell it.

1683
01:36:46.32 --> 01:36:47.32
Cool.

1684
01:36:47.32 --> 01:36:48.32
Best seller.

1685
01:36:48.32 --> 01:36:49.32
Really?

1686
01:36:49.32 --> 01:36:50.32
Yes.

1687
01:36:50.32 --> 01:36:54.60
It sells double the amount of the one with your head on it.

1688
01:36:54.60 --> 01:36:55.60
If you must.

1689
01:36:55.60 --> 01:36:56.60
No.

1690
01:36:56.60 --> 01:37:01.000
Nonetheless, yes, the shirt that Joko designed with my head is on it on there.

1691
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000
Bang.

1692
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.24
A bunch of other stuff on there as well.

1693
01:37:03.24 --> 01:37:05.20
We have a subscription situation for the shirt.

1694
01:37:05.20 --> 01:37:06.20
Some other shirts.

1695
01:37:06.20 --> 01:37:07.20
They're exclusive.

1696
01:37:07.20 --> 01:37:08.20
I said it.

1697
01:37:08.20 --> 01:37:09.20
Exclusive.

1698
01:37:09.20 --> 01:37:10.20
Okay.

1699
01:37:10.20 --> 01:37:11.20
It's called the shirt locker.

1700
01:37:11.20 --> 01:37:13.56
You have, you get one of these shirts every month.

1701
01:37:13.56 --> 01:37:17.68
It's a new, they're new, kind of creative for lack of a better term.

1702
01:37:17.68 --> 01:37:19.32
Designs.

1703
01:37:19.32 --> 01:37:21.24
If you're not part of the shirt locker, you don't get them.

1704
01:37:21.24 --> 01:37:22.24
Sorry.

1705
01:37:22.24 --> 01:37:23.96
It's like the nature of the locker.

1706
01:37:23.96 --> 01:37:24.96
You see?

1707
01:37:24.96 --> 01:37:25.96
Okay.

1708
01:37:25.96 --> 01:37:27.76
You in a little more simple this time, which was good.

1709
01:37:27.76 --> 01:37:30.32
I appreciate it this simplicity of it.

1710
01:37:30.32 --> 01:37:35.72
You still can't describe what the shirts are with any, with any sensible.

1711
01:37:35.72 --> 01:37:36.72
Yeah.

1712
01:37:36.72 --> 01:37:39.96
Well, some things can't be explained.

1713
01:37:39.96 --> 01:37:40.96
That's even better.

1714
01:37:40.96 --> 01:37:41.96
That's even better.

1715
01:37:41.96 --> 01:37:42.96
I like that.

1716
01:37:42.96 --> 01:37:43.96
Yeah.

1717
01:37:43.96 --> 01:37:46.80
Even to say, look, I can't really explain this, but trust me, you're going to want one

1718
01:37:46.80 --> 01:37:47.80
of these shirts.

1719
01:37:47.80 --> 01:37:48.80
Okay.

1720
01:37:48.80 --> 01:37:49.80
These shirts cannot be explained Joko.

1721
01:37:49.80 --> 01:37:51.80
They can only be experienced.

1722
01:37:51.80 --> 01:37:52.80
Bang.

1723
01:37:52.80 --> 01:37:57.12
So you make this choice whether or not you experience it by you wearing them or by

1724
01:37:57.12 --> 01:37:58.68
you seeing someone else wearing them.

1725
01:37:58.68 --> 01:37:59.68
That's up to you.

1726
01:37:59.68 --> 01:38:00.68
That part is up to you.

1727
01:38:00.68 --> 01:38:01.68
It's so low.

1728
01:38:01.68 --> 01:38:02.68
Yeah.

1729
01:38:02.68 --> 01:38:06.68
Thank you for either regret what you have done or what you have not done.

1730
01:38:06.68 --> 01:38:07.68
Yeah.

1731
01:38:07.68 --> 01:38:10.92
I think so too.

1732
01:38:10.92 --> 01:38:12.72
You see somebody representing in a shirt.

1733
01:38:12.72 --> 01:38:13.72
We like, well, that's cool.

1734
01:38:13.72 --> 01:38:14.72
I'm going to pick one of those up, but you can't.

1735
01:38:14.72 --> 01:38:15.72
It's true.

1736
01:38:15.72 --> 01:38:16.72
Yeah.

1737
01:38:16.72 --> 01:38:17.96
That's what the field is telling me is for his feet that goes.

1738
01:38:17.96 --> 01:38:18.96
So yeah, I did.

1739
01:38:18.96 --> 01:38:19.96
They're fueled.

1740
01:38:19.96 --> 01:38:20.96
They're fueled.

1741
01:38:20.96 --> 01:38:21.96
They're fueled.

1742
01:38:21.96 --> 01:38:22.96
Check this out.

1743
01:38:22.96 --> 01:38:24.96
I feel.

1744
01:38:24.96 --> 01:38:27.92
Anyway, like I said, JokoStore.com.

1745
01:38:27.92 --> 01:38:30.60
That's where you can get this cool stuff.

1746
01:38:30.60 --> 01:38:31.60
Speaking of cool stuff.

1747
01:38:31.60 --> 01:38:32.60
Yeah.

1748
01:38:32.60 --> 01:38:34.60
You can describe this for the guests.

1749
01:38:34.60 --> 01:38:39.76
If you want to, because Ecos seems to think that you have in the subscribe to it,

1750
01:38:39.76 --> 01:38:44.000
yeah, because you've been listening to 285 episodes.

1751
01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.36
287 episodes.

1752
01:38:46.36 --> 01:38:47.36
That's where you're at.

1753
01:38:47.36 --> 01:38:48.36
You're like, you know what?

1754
01:38:48.36 --> 01:38:49.96
Maybe today's the night.

1755
01:38:49.96 --> 01:38:51.36
Maybe you want to get that whole time.

1756
01:38:51.36 --> 01:38:54.24
And we whip out my iPhone and just hit subscribe.

1757
01:38:54.24 --> 01:38:57.36
Smash the subscribe button button.

1758
01:38:57.36 --> 01:38:58.36
Button.

1759
01:38:58.36 --> 01:38:59.36
Button.

1760
01:38:59.36 --> 01:39:00.36
But yeah.

1761
01:39:00.36 --> 01:39:02.28
So anyways, we got this podcast.

1762
01:39:02.28 --> 01:39:09.24
We got the Joko on Ravling podcast with DC, Dero Cooper of Marter Made Fame.

1763
01:39:09.24 --> 01:39:10.72
We got the grounded podcast.

1764
01:39:10.72 --> 01:39:12.28
We got the Warrior Kid podcast.

1765
01:39:12.28 --> 01:39:20.64
We also have Joko underground where we have a sovereign location, a virtual sovereign

1766
01:39:20.64 --> 01:39:28.80
location where we will not be impeded upon by forces.

1767
01:39:28.80 --> 01:39:32.80
So we will do what we want in the Joko underground look.

1768
01:39:32.80 --> 01:39:34.92
Hey, here's what's going on in the world.

1769
01:39:34.92 --> 01:39:37.44
There's things happening on these platforms.

1770
01:39:37.44 --> 01:39:38.88
There's things happening in these platforms.

1771
01:39:38.88 --> 01:39:40.36
We don't control the platforms.

1772
01:39:40.36 --> 01:39:41.36
We don't control the platforms.

1773
01:39:41.36 --> 01:39:46.16
There's a possibility that things could happen that could hurt what we're trying to

1774
01:39:46.16 --> 01:39:47.72
do.

1775
01:39:47.72 --> 01:39:52.84
Whether they start charging you money to listen on these platforms.

1776
01:39:52.84 --> 01:39:57.96
Whether they start inserting advertisements into the middle of us talking about World

1777
01:39:57.96 --> 01:40:04.96
War I or Vietnam and all of a sudden you're listening to an advertisement about what

1778
01:40:04.96 --> 01:40:05.96
that's what it is.

1779
01:40:05.96 --> 01:40:06.96
Mattresses.

1780
01:40:06.96 --> 01:40:09.64
We don't want to have that happen.

1781
01:40:09.64 --> 01:40:14.80
We definitely don't want to be censored for whatever reason.

1782
01:40:14.80 --> 01:40:16.60
So we got to have an alternative platform.

1783
01:40:16.60 --> 01:40:20.20
We made our own Joko underground.com.

1784
01:40:20.20 --> 01:40:22.48
Look, we hopefully we never have to go to it.

1785
01:40:22.48 --> 01:40:24.60
It's possible.

1786
01:40:24.60 --> 01:40:28.76
If we do, we'll be ready and we appreciate the support to get us ready.

1787
01:40:28.76 --> 01:40:34.04
If you want to subscribe to that, we do it a little extra podcast.

1788
01:40:34.04 --> 01:40:35.36

1789
01:40:35.36 --> 01:40:37.36
We give some amplifying information.

But we appreciate you hooking us up as well.

1795
01:40:52.36 --> 01:40:55.20
Freedom isn't free, by the way.

1796
01:40:55.20 --> 01:40:56.20
Yep.

1797
01:40:56.20 --> 01:40:58.36
We got to maintain that freedom.

1798
01:40:58.36 --> 01:41:03.80
We got a YouTube channel speaking of smashing the subscribe button.

1799
01:41:03.80 --> 01:41:04.80
And free.

1800
01:41:04.80 --> 01:41:05.80

Yeah.

1807
01:41:11.80 --> 01:41:16.80
Wouldn't it be annoying if the, like every video, that's what somebody's got to put

1808
01:41:16.80 --> 01:41:17.80
in the front of it.

1809
01:41:17.80 --> 01:41:19.52
Like and subscribe, that's what it is.

Oh yeah, and it plus hit the notification.

1813
01:41:23.84 --> 01:41:24.84
What are you doing, dude?

1814
01:41:24.84 --> 01:41:26.08
Let me know in the comments.

1815
01:41:26.08 --> 01:41:27.20
Yeah, let me know in the comments.

1816
01:41:27.20 --> 01:41:29.52
They always have some dumb thing to talk about.

1817
01:41:29.52 --> 01:41:30.92
Yes, you know.

1818
01:41:30.92 --> 01:41:31.92
Most of it.

1819
01:41:31.92 --> 01:41:32.92
Yeah, you know what I was thinking.

1820
01:41:32.92 --> 01:41:35.80
I was, if you want to see more videos like this could make, let me know in the comments.

1821
01:41:35.80 --> 01:41:36.80
Shut up, bro.

1822
01:41:36.80 --> 01:41:37.80
We talked about.

1823
01:41:37.80 --> 01:41:38.80
You know what?

1824
01:41:38.80 --> 01:41:42.04
You're, we'll just say, I'm not going to say your salty.

1825
01:41:42.04 --> 01:41:43.04
I'm not going to say that.

1826
01:41:43.04 --> 01:41:44.04
I'm a pernalist.

1827
01:41:44.04 --> 01:41:46.28
Your salty, but that's not what I'm saying.

1828
01:41:46.28 --> 01:41:51.24
The reason that you feel what I think that you're feeling right now about that is because

1829
01:41:51.24 --> 01:41:55.16
it's like, it's super obvious.

1830
01:41:55.16 --> 01:41:59.28
Like what they're doing, they want to like, they want the intel for the algorithm, right?

1831
01:41:59.28 --> 01:42:01.20
The more you want the engagement, right?

1832
01:42:01.20 --> 01:42:03.24
Obviously, they want the comments, they want the likes.

1833
01:42:03.24 --> 01:42:06.36
They want the, because that's for the algorithm so they can rate their video higher.

1834
01:42:06.36 --> 01:42:08.16
So they can, and you, we know that.

1835
01:42:08.16 --> 01:42:09.16
We know that.

1836
01:42:09.16 --> 01:42:10.16
We're not even mad at that.

1837
01:42:10.16 --> 01:42:11.16
Really kind of mad at that.

1838
01:42:11.16 --> 01:42:15.80
But they're known, but I think we, or you are mad, quote unquote, at the part where

1839
01:42:15.80 --> 01:42:18.48
they try to fake like that's not it.

1840
01:42:18.48 --> 01:42:20.68
They try to fake like, oh yeah, you let me know all it.

1841
01:42:20.68 --> 01:42:23.16
You know, you, you know, we're just going to be each other.

1842
01:42:23.16 --> 01:42:28.88
We're friends almost kind of a feeling and you're like, you don't want to know what I think,

1843
01:42:28.88 --> 01:42:30.36
you know, that's what it feels like.

1844
01:42:30.36 --> 01:42:31.36
I can't read the guys mind.

1845
01:42:31.36 --> 01:42:33.96
So I don't know if you really want to know or not, but that's how it feels.

1846
01:42:33.96 --> 01:42:35.48
That's why I feel it too.

1847
01:42:35.48 --> 01:42:42.92
Well, I'm, I don't say in the videos like comment, but I read the comments because

1848
01:42:42.92 --> 01:42:43.92
they're funny.

1849
01:42:43.92 --> 01:42:44.92
They're funny.

1850
01:42:44.92 --> 01:42:45.92
And they're good.

1851
01:42:45.92 --> 01:42:46.92
And some of them aren't interesting.

1852
01:42:46.92 --> 01:42:47.92
Yeah.

1853
01:42:47.92 --> 01:42:51.60
Some good tips on books to cover and stuff from YouTube comments.

1854
01:42:51.60 --> 01:42:53.000
Literally, that's kind of crazy, right?

1855
01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Yeah.

1856
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.72
So I'll read the comments because they're interesting.

1857
01:42:56.72 --> 01:42:58.28
They're funny.

1858
01:42:58.28 --> 01:43:04.04
Yeah, YouTube comments kind of have a reputation on that kind of straight up YouTube comments

1859
01:43:04.04 --> 01:43:11.20
have the rep, the stigma of being like a cesspool of just like unreasonable negativity.

1860
01:43:11.20 --> 01:43:16.92
But I think usually with our stuff, they can be constructive most of the time.

1861
01:43:16.92 --> 01:43:17.76
I'm down.

1862
01:43:17.76 --> 01:43:22.52
So if you want to leave a comment, leave a comment, like subscribe smash.

1863
01:43:22.52 --> 01:43:27.44
Anyway, yes, the point is we do have YouTube channel.

1864
01:43:27.44 --> 01:43:29.40
So if you want to look at that, but there you go.

1865
01:43:29.40 --> 01:43:31.92
Also, psychological warfare is an album that Jockel did.

1866
01:43:31.92 --> 01:43:35.64
I recorded back in the day for the purpose of the other.

1867
01:43:35.64 --> 01:43:37.64
Yeah, very hard.

1868
01:43:37.64 --> 01:43:38.64
No, man, it was helpful.

1869
01:43:38.64 --> 01:43:41.48
It was a very, literally press record.

1870
01:43:41.48 --> 01:43:42.48
Right.

1871
01:43:42.48 --> 01:43:43.48
That's what recording is.

1872
01:43:43.48 --> 01:43:44.48
You press record on the thing.

1873
01:43:44.48 --> 01:43:47.000
You think everybody's like super pumped on that?

1874
01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:48.000
I think they're very impressed.

1875
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Yeah.

1876
01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:53.72
Nonetheless, okay, the for you was recorded for the purpose of helping me through my moments

1877
01:43:53.72 --> 01:43:54.72
of weakness.

1878
01:43:54.72 --> 01:43:58.68
Then we added some other stuff about weaknesses that I don't have, but that other people

1879
01:43:58.68 --> 01:44:01.32
might have, which turned out to be the case.

1880
01:44:01.32 --> 01:44:04.56
So yeah, if you have some moments of weakness, you're listening to Jockel telling you how

1881
01:44:04.56 --> 01:44:08.16
to get over on bones, psychological warfare.

1882
01:44:08.16 --> 01:44:13.44
If you want to see a visual representation of how to stay on the path, go to flipsidecampus.com,

1883
01:44:13.44 --> 01:44:15.72

He's putting all stuff kind of cool stuff to hang on your wall and plus is Dakota Meyer,

1885
01:44:20.76 --> 01:44:24.12
which is just, well, it's Dakota Meyer.

Got some books.

So final spin, novel book, poem, transcript.

1892
01:44:36.48 --> 01:44:38.28
What did you think you called it?

1893

Text, text, literature.

1894
01:44:40.48 --> 01:44:41.48
Literature, literature.

1895
01:44:41.48 --> 01:44:42.48
Sure.

1896
01:44:42.48 --> 01:44:43.48
Hell yeah.

Leadership strategy and tactics.

1899
01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.04
The code, the evaluation protocol, this one of your freedom field, man, you'll read a little

1900
01:44:52.04 --> 01:44:54.28
bit of that today.

1901
01:44:54.28 --> 01:44:59.80
Way to work, get one, two and three, four, your kids for your neighbors, kids.

1902
01:44:59.80 --> 01:45:03.04
Just for every kid that you know, get them on the path when they're young, Mikey,

1903
01:45:03.04 --> 01:45:07.04
the dragons about face by hack worth, which I wrote the forward to extreme ownership

1904
01:45:07.04 --> 01:45:08.48
in the Dakota Meyer leadership.

1905
01:45:08.48 --> 01:45:09.48
Ashilam Front.

1906
01:45:09.48 --> 01:45:12.04
What do we do at Ashilam Front Dave?

1907
01:45:12.04 --> 01:45:14.04
We solve your problems, who leadership?

1908
01:45:14.04 --> 01:45:17.64
What about problems that aren't leadership problems?

1909
01:45:17.64 --> 01:45:20.28
If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times.

1910
01:45:20.28 --> 01:45:22.20
All your problems, our leadership problems.

1911
01:45:22.20 --> 01:45:24.20
I stole that though.

1912
01:45:24.20 --> 01:45:25.20
Who'd you do it for?

1913
01:45:25.20 --> 01:45:26.20
Somebody.

1914
01:45:26.20 --> 01:45:29.04
Go to echelonfront.com.

1915
01:45:29.04 --> 01:45:31.48
If you need help inside your company, that's what we do.

1916
01:45:31.48 --> 01:45:38.04
We have EF Online.com where we teach leadership principles online.

1917
01:45:38.04 --> 01:45:40.48
This is your leadership gym.

1918
01:45:40.48 --> 01:45:44.60
So where you're going and get some sets, get some reps, get it done.

1919
01:45:44.60 --> 01:45:47.72
Work up a little leadership sweat.

1920
01:45:47.72 --> 01:45:50.16
Do some role playing.

1921
01:45:50.16 --> 01:45:51.52
Ask some questions.

1922
01:45:51.52 --> 01:45:53.84
Where they're all the time.

1923
01:45:53.84 --> 01:45:57.84
We have a conference that we put on.

1924
01:45:57.84 --> 01:46:00.56
I don't know if that's the best word, but we have an event that we do.

1925
01:46:00.56 --> 01:46:02.68
I don't even know if that's the right word.

1926
01:46:02.68 --> 01:46:07.32
Anyways, there's a thing you can come to, which is called the master.

1927
01:46:07.32 --> 01:46:09.28
We talk about leadership for two days.

1928
01:46:09.28 --> 01:46:12.76
We do activities.

1929
01:46:12.76 --> 01:46:13.76
Come and check it out.

1930
01:46:13.76 --> 01:46:20.24
Phoenix, August 17th and 18th, Las Vegas, October 28th and 29th.

1931
01:46:20.24 --> 01:46:24.60
We have something called the FTX coming up.

1932
01:46:24.60 --> 01:46:27.28
July 12th and 13th.

1933
01:46:27.28 --> 01:46:32.64
If you want to check that out, it's tactical training with the emphasis on leadership.

1934
01:46:32.64 --> 01:46:35.56
You can take the leadership principles that we talk about all the time and imply them

1935
01:46:35.56 --> 01:46:39.24
an tactical environment, which will then be able to transfer.

1936
01:46:39.24 --> 01:46:42.000
For whatever environment you're in.

1937
01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:45.96
And if you want to help service members, active and retired their families, Goldstar

1938
01:46:45.96 --> 01:46:47.80
families, check out Mark Lee's mom.

1939
01:46:47.80 --> 01:46:50.44
Mom and Lee, she's got a charity organization.

1940
01:46:50.44 --> 01:46:58.48
And if you want to donate or you want to get involved, then go to America's MightyWorriers.com.org.

1941
01:46:58.48 --> 01:46:59.48
Sorry.

1942
01:46:59.48 --> 01:47:08.52
And if you want to hear, if you want to hear more of this of my,

1943
01:47:08.52 --> 01:47:17.000
fringingly long, just reading a text.

1944
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:24.12
If you want to hear echo Charles randomly ranting about God knows what.

1945
01:47:24.12 --> 01:47:33.36
If you want to hear Dave getting hyped up on things that don't matter, you'll find us on

1946
01:47:33.36 --> 01:47:37.92
the interwebs on Twitter, on the Graham, on Facebook,

1947
01:47:37.92 --> 01:47:41.000
echo is that echo Charles.

1948
01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.32
Dave is that David, our Burke and I am at Jocca Willink.

1949
01:47:45.32 --> 01:47:54.40
And to all of the uniformed personnel out there in the military who take these strategies

1950
01:47:54.40 --> 01:47:57.88
and put them into action to protect our way of life.

1951
01:47:57.88 --> 01:47:59.56
Thank you for what you do.

1952
01:47:59.56 --> 01:48:04.28
And to our police and law enforcement firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correctional

1953
01:48:04.28 --> 01:48:07.40
officers, Border Patrol, Secret Service and all first responders.

1954
01:48:07.40 --> 01:48:13.60
Thank you for protecting our way of life here at home.

1955
01:48:13.60 --> 01:48:21.56
And to everyone else out there, remember that Napoleon, the great military leader, Napoleon

1956
01:48:21.56 --> 01:48:31.44
Bonaparte, remember that he pursued his vision a piece for 20 years of war and ended

1957
01:48:31.44 --> 01:48:35.72
up defeated and in exile.

1958
01:48:35.72 --> 01:48:38.24
Don't do that.

1959
01:48:38.24 --> 01:48:40.36
Don't do that.

1960
01:48:40.36 --> 01:48:44.000
Think strategic.

1961
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:47.32
Just your ends to your means.

1962
01:48:47.32 --> 01:48:51.80
Make sure you can actually win.

1963
01:48:51.80 --> 01:48:55.08
Make sure you can see that pathway to victory.

1964
01:48:55.08 --> 01:49:02.32
Make sure you can see those pathways plural to victory and then start down that path.

1965
01:49:02.32 --> 01:49:06.40
And then give it everything you got.

1966
01:49:06.40 --> 01:49:10.96
Until next time, this is Dave and Echo and Jockel.

1967
01:49:10.96 --> 01:49:35.50
Ow.
