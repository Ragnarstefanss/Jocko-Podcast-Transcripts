00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 123 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.000 Now this podcast is the third in a series of podcasts that I've done.
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000 And if you haven't listened to podcasts number 121 and 122,
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000 then go back and listen to those episodes before you listen to this one.
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000 The first of those podcasts number 121 tells the story of Chester Poler,
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000 the iconic and heroic Marine Corps legend that fought in five wars.
00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:00.000 What's awarded five Navy crosses, the most of any servicemen ever re-retired as a three-star general after rising through the ranks from private.
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000 Podcast 123 tells a much different story.
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000 It tells the story of Chester Poler's son, Luis Poler, Jr.
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000 who also joined the Marine Corps.
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:32.000 Who fought Vietnam, who was horrifically wounded and continued to fight against pain and against loss and against depression and addiction when he returned home from war.
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:44.000 And in the end he lost that battle. After falling back into the downward spiral of alcohol and prescription pain killers,
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.000 he became another statistic of the most dreadful kind.
00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000 He turned the gun on himself and took his own life.
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000 And as I said at the beginning of this series,
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000 I was seriously questioning whether or not I could do this podcast.
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000 If I had the wherewithal to gut through the pain of that story,
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000 and more important if it was the right thing to do if it was the right thing to bring this story to light.
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000 Because clearly the story does not have a happy ending.
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000 And I wondered if there was any good at all to be found in it.
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000 But I also know that darkness left unchecked and ignored
00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:06.000 his darkness that grows. And if we do not learn from the past, then we know we are condemned to repeat it.
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000 There was one more compelling thing that allowed me to go forward in producing this series of podcasts about a year ago.
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000 I was in Texas and I was speaking at the Chris Kyle Memorial Benefit.
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000 Then I met someone there. He was a Marine.
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000 The uncle was a Marine. His grandfather was a Marine.
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000 And he had been severely wounded and I rack.
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000 And as I learned more about him, I came to understand the hell he had been through as much more than just physical.
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000 Like many veterans.
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000 The psychological wounds were also severe.
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000 But he had fought against the pain.
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000 He fought against the loss.
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:10.000 The fight that so many other veterans fight and he had come out the other side stronger and better and have dedicated his life to helping other veterans win that fight.
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000 His name is Jacob Shek.
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000 And there's an honor to have him on the podcast with us here tonight.
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000 Jake.
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000 Welcome to the show, brother.
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000 Thanks for having me, bro.
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000 Thanks for coming on, man.
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000 You bet. I'm here to help.
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000 Well, I know you help a lot of people.
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000 And I want to hopefully get you out there.
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000 Reach even more people.
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000 Thanks for that.
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000 When I first met you, I was just talking to you.
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000 I don't know. I probably spent a couple hours at some random bar in a hotel somewhere in Texas.
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000 Yeah, over there at the stockyard.
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000 Yeah.
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000 Man, I told you then, I said, you got to come and get on my podcast.
00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000 But when I was like I said, when I was reading these books, I was saying to myself, I got to have.
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000 I got to show the other side, man.
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000 I'm going to show that that you can get out of this. You get through it. And there's no better example that.
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000 Then, then you and the fight that you've been through.
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000 So let's get into it, man.
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000 Let's start. Let's start at the beginning.
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000 Let's start with young Jake.
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000 Oh, Lord, dude.
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000 I blocked up most much of the time.
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000 What were we talking about? Louisiana, bossier city.
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000 Is that how you say it?
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000 Back in the day.
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000 But now that was, that was until you were 12.
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000 Yeah, eight.
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000 Yeah, that was Bozier city.
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000 Yeah, but you could depend on what part of Louisiana or from pronounce like that.
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000 The other way.
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000 The wrong way.
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000 No, they're both right. And both sides of Louisiana will tell you that too.
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000 Nice.
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000 Yeah.
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000 But yeah, I went to Texas when I was about 12.
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000 And moved in with my mom.
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000 So I went from like a structured discipline home to the intent.
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000 This is of that.
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000 Which caught up to me pretty quick.
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000 Yeah.
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000 And so now your grandfather's ring was in the ring for?
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000 Yeah, grandfather served war to fall on E.O.
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000 And it survived.
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000 And was, you know, obviously the driving factor with my interest
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000 of being a Marine.
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000 And because I was really close to my grandmother growing up.
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000 And my grandfather passed away fairly long in the 50s.
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000 And there's a lot of questions about how he passed away.
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000 But we'll never know, right?
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000 I mean.
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000 So, but my grandmother would talk about my grandfather in her
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000 Trust was just swell with pride.
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000 You know, I was at the baby of the family.
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000 And so when I would see that, I just thought to myself,
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000 when she talks about me, I want her to do that same thing.
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000 So it looks like I need to be a Marine for that to happen.
00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000 Because every time she would talk about him, something from his
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000 time the service in the Marines would be very close to that sentence.
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000 And I knew, I want whatever that is.
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000 And at eight years old, I made my mind up that I'm getting that.
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000 No matter what it takes, I'm going to get that.
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000 I mean, the only alternative was death.
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000 That was the only thing that was going to stop me from getting it.
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000 And he and my grandmother and my uncle served in nom,
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000 and was the second generation Marine who's still very much alive.
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000 And he's pretty salty.
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000 And it was funny, man, because before I went to boot, I talked to him
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000 and he said, I don't know what to do.
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000 I'm about to go.
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000 What do I need to know?
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000 And this is all he said.
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000 It said, be loud, be fast.
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000 Don't volunteer for anything.
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000 That was it.
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000 So I'm on the phone and like waiting for the follow-up.
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000 Yeah.
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000 I was like, okay, what that's it.
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000 He loud, be fast.
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000 No volunteer, everything.
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000 I got to go.
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000 And you know what's funny, man, is he's right.
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000 I told that to.
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000 They're like, hey, what do I need to know?
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000 I bet you I've said that three dozen times.
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000 To inferl a pair.
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000 It's almost a complete opposite of what with the Master Chief of Seal team one told me when I got there.
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000 And he said, keep your mouth shut, keep your ears open.
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000 Don't forget anything and don't be late.
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000 That's what he told me.
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000 And you've, I volunteered for everything.
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000 I was dumb.
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000 But fired up.
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000 I was fired up kid.
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000 Yeah, well, not a lot of not much changed.
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:53.000 No, it's, it's actually interesting because in the in the in polar juniors book, he's talking about us as they're in there in the basic school and they're getting ready to select for what they want to do.
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000 And they start getting graffiti on the desks and people are like,
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000 uh,
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000 motor T and out in three who gives the fuck driver truck and they're just being, they're like,
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000 not all of them.
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000 A lot of them started looking to work on him and you know what I don't want them to that.
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000 And very few of them were saying, hey, I want to be an infantry commander.
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000 And that's what a lot of them got, whether they wanted it or not.
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000 And then a lot of them got work, rather they wanted it or not.
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000 Yeah.
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000 Well, like I was just telling you, he was, he was OCS, the basic school 20 days leave in Vietnam as a two commander.
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000 Welcome to the court.
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000 Yeah.
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000 You know, just when you think the green wind he can't get any harder, you know,
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000 it can't, there's no limit.
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000 I mean, it's just true.
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:48.000 It's like, with me, it was never, I never questioned, you know,
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000 I became a decent football player when I got the Texas, which was basically a
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000 graduated high school.
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000 Not basically.
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000 That's not a graduate high school.
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000 I was lucky enough to be just selected as a captain, my senior year and you know,
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000 I played for five eight takes football team, which was, this is the real deal in Texas, man.
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000 And it's not just under the NFL.
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000 Like in terms of intensity.
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000 You know, we had our team and get together and we'd be like,
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000 we would like list out all the college teams.
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000 We were totally sure we could be just the young and stupid.
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000 Man, I mean, and it's just, it's crazy because you see the athleticism
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000 difference between, especially when you go to your big schools and the NFL,
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000 it's the speed, crazy.
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000 And the strength, I mean, all of it, the agility, it's night and day.
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000 It's night and day and it just goes to show you as young kids.
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000 You don't know shit.
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000 You think you know a lot, you don't know shit.
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000 I mean, I was that way.
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000 And I mean, well, really, I still don't know shit.
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000 And I'll be 36 this month.
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000 And I mean, anyone who comes up to me and they're like, hey, I got it figured out.
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000 You know what I said?
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000 Perfect.
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000 You know, long there need to be in my circle because I'll never learn anything from you.
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000 Yeah.
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000 I know I'm going to die student life, but I mean, I was I loved football.
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000 That was, that's what I thought high school was for.
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000 You know.
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000 And so it was the old cliche thing.
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000 You know, it was, it was my small city.
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000 Um, where in Texas, where you top out?
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000 I got up at a COPB yellow.
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000 Look out was.
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000 And, you know, had it not been for the, for like my counselor in the principal and all those people,
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000 like I wouldn't graduate it.
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.000 Because I was pre-spent from the, the political crap by the time, you know, my senior year rolled around.
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000 And I just didn't know if I wanted it.
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000 I didn't know if I wanted it to do with it anymore.
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000 You know, I didn't know if I wanted to play the game.
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000 It comes with playing the game.
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000 And it just got to where it was like, you know, this is, it's kind of bullshit.
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000 Because it's like growing up, right?
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000 Small town Louisiana where you go to church every Wednesday, every Sunday morning.
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000 And you put on your Sunday best and you go to church and you act a certain way or you're out in public and you act a certain way.
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000 You know, but you get home, the doors closed, that's all bullshit.
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000 I mean, in Ruby and condition is little kids.
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000 Like, hey, just, just fake it till you make it.
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000 And, you know, I'm alright saying that now.
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000 So you got, so when you were in high school, you kind of got tired of playing the game.
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000 You were just thinking, now, now, didn't you join the Marine Corps?
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000 Yeah, but getting in my senior year is also already 18.
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000 I didn't tell anybody, because all those people I did.
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000 And I went over famously with my dad.
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000 Because my dad thought I was going to go play ball to small school.
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000 Because because I missed more days, my senior year than I actually went to.
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000 Because from football season was over, I was like, sweet, I'm done.
00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000 Yeah.
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000 Like, that's it.
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000 I like, I don't need to do this school shit anymore.
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000 That's overrated.
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000 But I knew it was not, you know, I mean, then they,
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000 Now, were you thinking, did you join, were you planning to go active duty, were you in the reserves?
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000 No, so I'd signed up in my recruiter who I'll never forget is,
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000 It was a, he was legit, man.
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000 You hear a lot of like horror stories about recruiters.
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000 I literally, I literally have a question here.
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000 It's like, how is your recruiter?
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000 Because so many people have got recruiter stories.
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000 One way or the other, that either screwed him or it's only took care of him.
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000 So my recruiter, first of all, he got me out of a lot of stuff where I was like,
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000 Dude, we're now days, there's no way.
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000 It just wouldn't fly.
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000 Yeah.
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000 And I was like, how old did you do?
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000 Because if you don't worry about it, you'd just better be in the office.
00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000 So I tell you, be in the office.
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000 I might, bro, you can drive me if you want.
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000 But he, he, so they, you know,
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000 Most recruiting stations are like inside a shopping center or whatever.
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000 So they were right next to like a big grocery store chain and one day,
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000 some, some dude goes and still some stuff.
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:13.000 And, and he chases him down and like whips his ass in the parking lot.
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000 So he's a firefighter in the court, right?
00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000 So, and I volunteered for infantry.
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000 I was like, I'm going to be on a big run.
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000 He tried talking me out of it for months.
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000 Yeah.
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000 He's like, Jake, you really don't want to.
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000 I was like, no, that's what I want to do.
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000 Yeah.
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000 And, but he chased the dude down and I was like, see,
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000 that was for me, that was affirmation from God that I'm doing the right thing.
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000 You know, these are my people.
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000 Yeah, that's just where I was supposed to be, you know.
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000 But it was, man, I, I, my second, I think it was a second week of football season.
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000 And I, I jacked up my right knee,
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000 and I'm seeing all my right knee and, and when I went inside the paperwork,
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000 I was on crutches and then in a brace.
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000 And I, I opened the door and like, hobbling and he goes,
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000 what are you doing?
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000 And I said, I'm sure sign up and he goes, not like that.
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000 You're not?
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000 You know, I said, give me two weeks.
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000 We're playing whoever we're playing.
00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000 I said, I'll be on the field, give me two weeks.
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000 I mean, it was like, there's no way.
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000 I said, okay, be here in two weeks.
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000 And he showed up and I played it hurt like hell.
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000 But I played through it, lied to my trainers, lied to the coaches.
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000 So, I'm good.
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000 I'm good.
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000 You know, just a young dumb, like, you know, power before IQ, right?
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000 Just power through.
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000 If you can just power through, you don't really need the IQ.
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000 And that's what you're going to be stupid.
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000 You got to be tough.
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000 That's it.
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000 That's it, man.
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000 And there's a lot of truth to that, which we can all access to that.
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000 Right?
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000 Every person.
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000 I don't care.
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000 I don't care.
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000 If you have a pecker or not, you can access to that.
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000 If you're going to be stupid, you better be tough.
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000 I'll be tough for sure.
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000 And so, we, but I ended up playing and I signed up.
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000 I didn't tell anybody, and then it was actually, I graduated by the grace of God.
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000 And because of high school football and taxes.
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:18.000 And it was, it was amazing, man, because my dad actually met my recruiter at the high school graduation.
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000 And he was in his dress bluest, which is, you know, the best uniform there is.
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000 No one can argue.
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000 And if you do, you just stay.
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000 Yeah.
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000 But he walks up and I said, hey, Dad, you know, I'd like you to meet my, my recruiter.
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000 When he looked at me, my recruiter holds his hand out the shake.
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000 I said, man, my dad looked at me.
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000 And he said, you're dad, was this your dad finding out?
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000 Yeah.
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000 Oh, dang.
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000 And he said, why would you do that?
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000 And then he looks at my recruiter, looks back at me, like waiting for me to answer.
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000 And I said, Dad, I would shake his hand.
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000 You're your banker.
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000 I would shake his hand.
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000 Pretty sure you could take it.
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000 And he, he was pissed, man.
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000 He was pissed because he's, and I didn't understand why at the time really.
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000 You know, but later on, this is 2000, right?
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000 This is pretty 2000.
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000 Yeah, 2001 actually.
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000 I was my graduation.
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000 So this is May, May, June, 2001.
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000 So, yeah, this is pretty 90%.
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000 I'm already signed up.
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000 I'm in.
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000 I'm going.
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000 And he, so your dad's thoughts were more around, like, hey, you should go to college.
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000 You should get a job.
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.000 Yeah.
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000 You know, I'm a banker.
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000 It's a good life.
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.000 Yeah.
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000 That type of thing.
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000 You don't need to go and do this other stuff.
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000 Exactly.
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000 And so, and so my thing was,
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000 There's no war going on, you know, at the time.
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.000 No, right.
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000 Yeah, no.
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000 I mean, it was, it was, quote on quote piece time.
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:41.000 Yeah.
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000 And, uh, who's we all know, there's just something.
00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000 But whatever.
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000 You know, whatever.
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000 Rainbows and roses and lollipop people want to have in their safety bubble.
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000 But we, you know, we.
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000 I knew that that was.
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000 That's what I was destined to do.
00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000 I knew it.
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000 Like I felt it as much as I know that, like, my legs and that were going to grow back.
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000 Like I knew that much that this is what I'm supposed to do.
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000 And I was helping on it.
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000 Helped it.
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000 And so, my dad was pissed.
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000 I was, I questioned it because maybe I didn't tell him, right?
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000 I got that from him and in a mirror, he had a thing.
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000 He's right. I mean, it's never just one thing.
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.000 Anything.
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000 It's never just one thing.
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000 Like I love people.
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000 Like, well, I know what the problem is.
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000 And like, well, what do you want to bet there's more than one?
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000 Because it's, it's just the way it is.
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000 But he, I didn't realize and I didn't think about, you know, at the time,
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000 I'm, I'm 19 at this point.
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:42.000 And I didn't think about he had seen what war does to not only a person,
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000 but someone that is his blood, his flesh and blood.
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000 He's seen the after effects.
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000 You know, he's, so he saw it with his dad and you won't.
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000 Was that his dad or his mom's dad?
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000 That was my dad's dad.
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000 And his brother, his older brother.
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000 Yeah.
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000 And so he had seen the after effects and seeing, you know, my grandfather was a hard man.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000 And, you know, the way that he, he was a man when it was okay to be a man.
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000 And you wouldn't get judged for being a man.
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000 Where is now that's a lot.
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000 I mean, don't act like you don't want to help talk about you.
00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000 Because now it's like, but you can use you through bathroom.
00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000 That's okay.
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000 Oh, I guess.
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000 Yeah.
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000 I mean, yeah, I'm looking at you with a blank stare because I'm like detached from all that,
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000 like all that politic.
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000 I don't even, it's weird, man.
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000 My life is weird that I don't, I just kind of revolve and revolve in my own little world.
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000 So when I, when I hear like, when I do, when that kind of stuff enters my world,
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000 I'm just kind of like, is that really happening?
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000 It doesn't really compute and I move on.
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000 I don't know.
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000 Well, see, but when you're in my world, it's almost, you have to know.
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000 It's not me, unfortunately, with what we're trying to do.
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000 Yeah.
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000 It's, you know, it's a big ass mountain.
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000 We're trying to move, man.
00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000 And it's, but anyway, I go to, I go to boot and actually nine, eleven happens.
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000 Yeah.
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000 I'm in my room the night before.
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000 And the whole thing behind the reserves was,
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000 so I thought about it and I was like, okay.
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:17.000 So when you graduate may of 2001, you, you screw around for the summer being a Texas kid
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000 that graduated from my school that's going in the Marine Corps.
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000 Oh, yeah.
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000 That was a real PG rated situation.
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000 Hundred percent.
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000 Then September 11th, that when's your boot camp when you leave in your boot camp?
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000 I leave for boot camp the month after 9, 11th.
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000 So it's on.
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000 Yeah.
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000 So it was nine, eleven happens.
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000 And so the way I looked at it was like, okay, you know what?
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000 My grandfather was Corporal Schick, my uncle was Corporal Schick.
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000 I'm going to raise the bar for whoever the fourth generation is.
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000 I mean, because that's what we're supposed to do, right?
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000 For those that come after us.
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000 And so I was like, okay, I'm going to join the reserves.
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000 Still infantry.
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000 I'm always going to stay infantry.
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000 I wanted to be a career infantryman.
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000 And then I'll pick up B5.
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000 By that time, I'll already have my degree.
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000 And then I'll get my commission.
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000 Then I'll be a must thing.
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000 So whoever the fourth generation is, like the bar set.
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000 Correct.
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000 Like that. So that was my mindset, right?
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000 Obviously, Johnny G. I had a different plan.
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000 But we, but nine, eleven happens.
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000 Yeah.
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000 And then it was, I mean, it became very real, very quick.
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000 Yeah.
00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000 That, oh, okay.
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000 Well, this is, I mean, I was going home about it.
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000 Yeah. But my, in my body, we wake up and my mother walks in my room and
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000 like opens the door and beer cans like get pushed everywhere.
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000 So first she's like, what the hell is this?
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000 And then she's like, turn on the TV.
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000 You were under attack.
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000 And I turned on the TV.
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000 I looked at my body and we went to the, we did the body system.
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000 And the court, and I looked at him and I was like, bro, we're going to war.
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000 Jack.
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000 And it was when it, you know, for a 19 year old kid,
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000 you have that sense of, let's rock and roll.
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000 But then the smart little little, little smart person that lives in the back of your head
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000 was like, this may suck.
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000 Like this may suck bad.
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000 But it didn't, obviously, didn't deter my motivation in doing that.
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000 And so we, yeah, man, I left the month after 9, 11, which was, you know,
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000 I was right down the street from here.
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000 And I'm, see, R.D. San Diego, man, and I, let me tell you something.
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000 As if Marie court, her own structure,
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000 and he'd need more motivation to be Marie court, her own structure.
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000 They had it.
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000 September 11th, they were ready to get some.
00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000 They had it.
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000 It was gnarly.
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000 But no matter, from the time that we landed,
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000 and the time that we got on the bus,
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000 which, this was something that always crack me up.
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000 Because you land, you can see the depot from the runway.
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000 But for whatever reason, the bus ride takes like an hour and a half.
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000 You know?
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000 That's welcome to the military in general.
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000 It didn't take long for me to completely understand why that is the way it is.
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000 And so it was, but from the time, the first time I still on the elephant prince,
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:20.000 he's up till now.
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000 But to this point right now, today, I wouldn't question, I don't question any of it.
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000 I don't, I wouldn't take any of it back.
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000 I wouldn't trade any of it.
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000 I have no doubt that everything has happened exactly the way it's supposed to happen.
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000 I don't believe in coincidences.
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000 And I wouldn't take anything back.
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000 I mean, just because something that I've learned at the right old age
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000 of soon to be 36 is that you can't have triomphe
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000 without trials of tribulation and tragedy.
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000 Those are kissing cousins.
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000 You know, you can't have one without the other.
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000 And where you go with it is up to you.
00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000 And, you know, my life was one hell of a roller coaster ride.
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000 And it started the first time I still don't know the elephant prince.
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000 And it started way before that, man.
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000 Started, you know, I definitely had trauma before the trauma.
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000 I mean, I think majority of us do because we live in a very spoiled, first world society.
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000 And we forget that we're mere mortals.
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000 Just on the special about us.
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000 We're all the same.
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000 We were all just living, breathing, sexeskin.
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000 Jack.
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000 You know, that's it.
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000 And so I, when I started boot, it was,
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000 it was one of those deals where the mindset started of.
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000 And I already had some leadership skills.
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000 Thanks to football and team sports.
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000 And I had, I learned that growing up.
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000 And then in high school, I really got the home, those leadership skills.
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000 Which really helped me.
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000 And boot.
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000 I mean, I really believe in team athletics because it's, it's like everything.
00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.000 No matter what you're dealing with,
00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000 the greater good is always going to be bigger than you.
00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000 Always.
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000 And you have to hang on to that humility in that.
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000 I'm just, I'm just a dude.
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000 I'm just a dude.
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000 Being a dude.
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000 But I'm just a dude playing a dude.
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000 Trying to be another dude.
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000 But, you know what I'm, you know what I'm mean.
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000 It's, you, you, you realize often.
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000 If you're really trying to do something that's worth doing,
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000 you'll remind it often how human you are.
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000 Yeah.
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000 And, and, you know, I used to tell my guys if you're doing something for the right reasons,
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000 you're going to win in the end.
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000 Like, and that means if you're doing something that's going to help the team win,
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000 you're going to win in the end.
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000 You're going to get what you want.
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000 The things are going to go the way you want.
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000 If you're doing something for yourself as reasons or for the wrong reasons,
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000 you're going to lose in the end.
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000 Now, you might, both those, the person that's doing it for the right reasons,
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000 might lose some battles along the way.
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000 The person that's doing it for the wrong reasons might win some battles along the way.
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000 But, the end game.
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000 Person, if you're doing the right things, the right reasons,
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000 if you're looking out for the team, if you're doing it for the good of the team,
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000 you're going to win.
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000 And if you're doing the opposite, eventually you're going to lose.
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000 That's the way it works.
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000 That's it.
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000 You're on the right.
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000 I mean, you know what the history books, they'll get right.
00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000 They do.
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.000 They'll get it out every time.
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000 Sometimes, sometimes, it takes years.
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.000 Sometimes it takes 10 years.
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000 Takes decades.
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000 But, the people that are doing the right things,
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000 the right reasons they win.
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000 Yeah.
00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000 And I'd say, it's like, I tell guys all the time, which I still,
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000 the humanality in me still has to, I have to remind.
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000 Every time I talk to a guy, when I say,
00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000 guy, I mean, man or woman doesn't matter.
00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000 But every time I talk to him, I usually start the conversation out with,
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000 no matter what comes out of this hole underneath my nose,
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000 I need you to know I'm talking to myself too.
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000 Every time.
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000 Yeah, sure.
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000 And I say, it's, I say, you know, it's, it's none of our business.
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000 What the hell other people think of us.
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000 It is none of my business, what anyone else thinks of me.
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000 It should have very little impact on any decision I make every day,
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000 all day.
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000 None.
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000 It should have no impact.
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000 Yeah.
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:01.000 Yeah.
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000 There's an interesting dichotomy in that.
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000 And I've talked about that on this podcast before.
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000 Because for me, right?
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000 I'm a guy that on the one hand, I, I exact same thing.
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.000 Like, I don't care what people think.
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000 At the, at the other end of the spectrum,
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000 I absolutely care when I, whatever one of the things.
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000 And I'll draw you into this.
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000 When you were doing something,
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000 I mean, when I was doing something in the SEAL teams,
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000 I'd be thinking always like, hey,
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000 this is the right thing.
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000 What's this going to do to my reputation?
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000 What, what is, what is, you know,
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000 my buddy going to think of me if I cut the corner here.
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000 If I don't do the right thing.
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000 So my reputation the way I was looked at,
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000 I did feel that pressure all the time.
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000 And at the same time, if someone was like,
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000 oh, I don't like your clothes or whatever.
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000 I don't care at all.
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000 But things that I cared about and from people that I cared about
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000 and respected, I always had the attitude that like, yeah,
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000 you know what?
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000 I do care what they think.
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000 I do care what my, you know,
00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000 I'll tell you what, man,
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000 one of the hardest things I had to do when I, when I wrote a book.
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000 And like, here you are.
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000 You're going to write a book.
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000 You know, you're going to write a book about yourself.
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000 It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000 arrogant, conceited thing to do no matter what you say in the book.
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000 It doesn't matter.
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000 It's, you're writing a book about about you.
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000 And, and, you know, lay for wrote the book with me same thing.
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000 The primary concern for me was like,
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000 what are my bros in the teams going to think of me, right?
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000 So, that's hard.
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000 Yeah, but there's, so there's a balance between those two.
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000 All right.
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000 Let's, let me, let me simplify it.
00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000 The people that you're never going to meet.
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000 Yeah.
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000 So, I, I, I'll, I'll barny style it for you.
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000 Sometimes you need to dump the things down for this guy over here.
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000 Everyone at this table, what should be honest,
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000 you, you, you, the, the people you're never going to meet.
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.24 them meet, they will have little to no impact on your life and your well-being, hence
00:29:03.24 --> 00:29:07.60 forth. It doesn't matter. They think they matter and that's okay, let them think what they
00:29:07.60 --> 00:29:13.60 want to think. But it doesn't matter. Yeah, now that's 100% right for sure. Because it's
00:29:13.60 --> 00:29:19.88 real easy, especially in the line of work that we do, that we do day to day, it's
00:29:19.88 --> 00:29:26.42 going to kill. That it's real easy for people to sit on their self-loathing asses behind their
00:29:26.42 --> 00:29:32.68 computer screen and past judgment. When we continue to grind onward in the face of tremendous
00:29:32.68 --> 00:29:42.32 loss, there's something we said for that. Yeah. I mean, that's that that that right there
00:29:42.32 --> 00:29:48.12 is a test of willing character. All its own. And the face of tremendous loss to say, okay.
00:29:48.12 --> 00:29:55.84 We have to step back. We have to reassess. We'll read address and we'll re-engage. What's
00:29:55.84 --> 00:30:01.08 the dress or our left right now limits but, but there's still ground to take and demons
00:30:01.08 --> 00:30:07.96 to slay. We have to move forward and burn our pain as fuel. Because that's what we do.
00:30:07.96 --> 00:30:14.80 Because if not us who. And so that all that started when I was standing on those yellow
00:30:14.80 --> 00:30:22.08 footprints because you had this and it's something that you would. People that know
00:30:22.08 --> 00:30:26.04 their stuff about the military agrees with one thing that can be said about the Marine
00:30:26.04 --> 00:30:31.32 Corps. No other branch. Regardless of the vision at here's tradition as much as the
00:30:31.32 --> 00:30:37.04 Marines. I mean, you asked me about about Chastian. I'm like, yeah, I mean, we told him
00:30:37.04 --> 00:30:41.80 good night every night for three months. The Marine Corps is absolutely absolutely correct.
00:30:41.80 --> 00:30:45.40 Yeah, the Marine Corps does not play around when it comes to tradition. And I think that there's
00:30:45.40 --> 00:30:53.20 a. The proofs in the pudding, right? I mean, since 1775, we've shown that we adhere to that.
00:30:53.20 --> 00:31:00.96 That's what makes us who we are. And that's why it's, I think that we have the success
00:31:00.96 --> 00:31:05.76 rate that we have regardless of being the bachelor children of the military. Not really
00:31:05.76 --> 00:31:13.68 known where that is and being poor. It we make it work. We we have since day one,
00:31:13.68 --> 00:31:18.84 who've been able to really define what improvised adaption overcome means. We've been
00:31:18.84 --> 00:31:25.92 able to live that and prove situations where outside looking in, that's going to, it's
00:31:25.92 --> 00:31:32.52 a total loss and come out with a W. Come out with a victory because of that very
00:31:32.52 --> 00:31:38.32 tradition that makes us who we are. Because when all those fellows, all you have is your
00:31:38.32 --> 00:31:45.24 gut. Oh, yeah. Now, when you're going through boot camp, though, there was was there any combat
00:31:45.24 --> 00:31:51.96 veterans there? I don't know you had one. Yeah. That's that's the testament to what you're
00:31:51.96 --> 00:31:56.36 talking about, right? Yeah. Is that even though no one been in combat in, well, they're
00:31:56.36 --> 00:31:59.60 probably even if you guys went to go for maybe there's a couple of guys that went to
00:31:59.60 --> 00:32:04.60 Grenade or something or Panama, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. But those are like ones, these and
00:32:04.60 --> 00:32:11.60 two, these. Right. And there's a chance that like none of your DIs had any combat experience.
00:32:11.60 --> 00:32:15.60 No, it's a great point. Yeah. And yet the lessons get passed on. You're head old, old
00:32:15.60 --> 00:32:21.60 Vietnam seal on here. And he was talking about when he came back from Vietnam. And he instituted
00:32:21.60 --> 00:32:27.60 this certain type of training at out in the desert. And I was like, I went through that training.
00:32:27.60 --> 00:32:32.60 And he's like, yeah, well, I put that together. Like the same, it's a point man course where
00:32:32.60 --> 00:32:35.60 they put we'd be trapped and they put targets to chew that. Yeah. That's stuff. I was like, yeah,
00:32:35.60 --> 00:32:39.60 he's like, yeah, I made that up. And I was like, oh, we still do it. We still do it. And so
00:32:39.60 --> 00:32:45.60 that tradition in the Marine Corps is like 200 years of things being passed down. Right.
00:32:45.60 --> 00:32:50.60 Solid. Yeah. I mean, it's something that, I mean, listen, even now, it makes me
00:32:50.60 --> 00:32:54.60 swell Friday. You know, like I understand why my grandmother reacted to me. She did
00:32:54.60 --> 00:32:59.60 it truly now. You know, and I've been able to live that. I've been blessed enough
00:32:59.60 --> 00:33:07.60 to live this journey that, I mean, yeah, comes with a lot of pain and a lot of
00:33:07.60 --> 00:33:12.60 hard lessons. You know, I mean, pains and available suffering is optional.
00:33:12.60 --> 00:33:17.60 It's something I've learned to. You know, I mean, it's no one's going to be harder on you than
00:33:17.60 --> 00:33:21.60 you. Every day you wake up. You should just be thinking to yourself, alright, today
00:33:21.60 --> 00:33:27.60 it's me versus me. You know, and no one wakes up and goes, I'm going to go out of my way
00:33:27.60 --> 00:33:33.60 to be average today. Like if you wake up and do that, you need to have a gut
00:33:33.60 --> 00:33:38.60 check. So, so you get, you get done with boot camp and then you go to
00:33:38.60 --> 00:33:44.60 Pendleton for for infantry. So I went up to Pendleton and, you know, it's was
00:33:44.60 --> 00:33:52.60 fun. You know, it sucks as in boot. I was first squat, squat, leader up until like a week before
00:33:52.60 --> 00:33:56.60 graduation. I think it's just because the senior general instructor didn't like me.
00:33:56.60 --> 00:34:01.60 I didn't like him either, though. So it was mutual. But, um, and there's one
00:34:01.60 --> 00:34:05.60 D.I.I.I. that I swear if I saw him on a street today, like I'd go find him right now.
00:34:05.60 --> 00:34:11.60 I'm not kidding at all. There was one dude that I got had PTSD as from that guy
00:34:11.60 --> 00:34:16.60 because he was going out of his way to try and mentally break me and it just never happened
00:34:16.60 --> 00:34:22.60 and what do you think, what do you, why was that? I think it was just it became this personal thing
00:34:22.60 --> 00:34:28.60 to him because he saw how other recruits would gravitate through he might have been like
00:34:28.60 --> 00:34:32.60 jealous of your, my downed bachelor, I don't know that at all. I don't make because he was
00:34:32.60 --> 00:34:38.60 ugly. He was not handsome like yourself. No, and obviously, I mean, money maker
00:34:38.60 --> 00:34:46.60 bro. But he was, um, but he was, you could tell the underneath at all, like he was,
00:34:46.60 --> 00:34:52.60 he was a great Marine. Yeah. Yeah. And he, you know, we lot a lot for that guy and
00:34:52.60 --> 00:34:57.60 for you other D.I.s. But, you know, it was just, I was thankful for our boot camp
00:34:57.60 --> 00:35:03.60 with the last name like Schick. You know, our guides last name was Schmitter.
00:35:03.60 --> 00:35:09.60 Yeah. That's nice. So for three months, hey, Schitter, we'll get your brother Schick.
00:35:09.60 --> 00:35:14.60 Three months, man. The only time I ever got emotional in boot camp was on the Parade deck
00:35:14.60 --> 00:35:21.60 on graduation day. When, um, handlers, one of the D.I.s. We had, he looked at me and he,
00:35:21.60 --> 00:35:27.60 he said, I got to tell you Schick and I heard the, and I got emotional. I
00:35:27.60 --> 00:35:33.60 got emotional. I did. I got my name back. I heard it back. But, um, he told me what he told me.
00:35:33.60 --> 00:35:39.60 And then my dad was there actually in, and walks by me on the Parade deck and tosses me a
00:35:39.60 --> 00:35:42.60 can of Copenhagen, won't cut. Didn't even look at me and he said, good job. Let's go eat.
00:35:42.60 --> 00:35:45.60 Like keeps walking. So it's okay. Still pissed. Like, get it.
00:35:45.60 --> 00:35:50.60 Dang. Yeah. Oh, blooded. Yeah, dude. But it was, you know, like I said,
00:35:50.60 --> 00:35:55.60 there, there for years, I didn't get it. And then, you know, go up to S.O.I.
00:35:55.60 --> 00:36:00.60 to Pinnleton and, um, I loved every member of that too.
00:36:00.60 --> 00:36:04.60 Here's what made it awesome for me. And this is something that, a lot of,
00:36:04.60 --> 00:36:08.60 the listeners will relate to is that. No matter how
00:36:08.60 --> 00:36:10.60 normally it got in boot or how
00:36:10.60 --> 00:36:15.60 normally it got in S.O.I. or how tired or hungry or just beat down,
00:36:15.60 --> 00:36:21.60 you were mentally, physically, emotionally. There, all you had to do is look to
00:36:21.60 --> 00:36:27.60 your left or right because guess what? So are they. Yeah. But you go to fall down.
00:36:27.60 --> 00:36:32.60 They're right there to pick you up. No matter how tired you're, who doesn't
00:36:32.60 --> 00:36:38.60 want that? Yeah. No. You can't buy it. You can't buy, you have to pay for
00:36:38.60 --> 00:36:43.60 that with sweat blood and tears, period. And I learned also early on,
00:36:43.60 --> 00:36:47.60 you're going to find your great leaders by following the blood
00:36:47.60 --> 00:36:52.60 and tomorrow. Literally and figuratively. It's not hard to find.
00:36:52.60 --> 00:36:56.60 Take off your first warm blinders, you'll find them. Follow the blood
00:36:56.60 --> 00:37:01.60 show, you'll find them. And I knew the ones that were and I knew the ones
00:37:01.60 --> 00:37:05.60 that were. And now, so does everyone else.
00:37:05.60 --> 00:37:10.60 It comes out in the wash, right? But we, you know, S.O.I. was awesome.
00:37:10.60 --> 00:37:14.60 I mean, I remember the first, the first weekend we had live
00:37:14.60 --> 00:37:19.60 in the first weekend. And what's the first thing that you think that they tell us
00:37:19.60 --> 00:37:24.60 young stupid Marines? And, and, and, and, and so I Pendleton.
00:37:24.60 --> 00:37:27.60 Are you getting your first liberty? The one place not to go.
00:37:27.60 --> 00:37:32.60 TJ? The one place. I mean, where do you think like a
00:37:32.60 --> 00:37:35.60 van full of us go? Yeah. Yeah. Do you take a Marine Corps van?
00:37:35.60 --> 00:37:38.60 No, but we should. That would have been impressive. You should.
00:37:38.60 --> 00:37:42.60 I can't, I still, to this day. You know, you left Friday
00:37:42.60 --> 00:37:46.60 evening. I, to this day. I can't be there. Let me back in the United
00:37:46.60 --> 00:37:53.60 States. Like I was, I was thrilled. Hard. And at the time, my brother,
00:37:53.60 --> 00:37:56.60 I don't know if this is a draw for the time, where he was actually,
00:37:56.60 --> 00:38:00.60 she was for some reason here in, and so I count on and she was like,
00:38:00.60 --> 00:38:04.60 hey, come, you know, see me. And I saw her somewhere by the
00:38:04.60 --> 00:38:09.60 border or whatever. I'm sure I smelled amazing. Yeah. And like the look on
00:38:09.60 --> 00:38:14.60 her face was like, how are you breathing right now? Because, you know,
00:38:14.60 --> 00:38:18.60 my idea was when they said turn to a liberty. Oh, yeah. Like that's exactly.
00:38:18.60 --> 00:38:22.60 I was, I was seeking liberty. Yeah. No matter, and I wanted to find
00:38:22.60 --> 00:38:25.60 what liberty look like. I've told this story before. I was, we pulled
00:38:25.60 --> 00:38:27.60 into port one time. I was on a ship. It was in the seal
00:38:27.60 --> 00:38:29.60 between. We pulled into port. And what we used to do, there's
00:38:29.60 --> 00:38:33.60 be a line to get off the ship. Like check and liberty cars. So when the
00:38:33.60 --> 00:38:36.60 ship pulled into port, we'd work out that taking hour, then we
00:38:36.60 --> 00:38:40.60 take a shower, and then the line would be gone. We go out. So we do that.
00:38:40.60 --> 00:38:44.60 We're, we've been in port for like an hour and 15 minutes. We go up to
00:38:44.60 --> 00:38:48.60 leave and they're carrying a Marine back on the ship. He's completely
00:38:48.60 --> 00:38:52.60 covered a few passed out drunk. He did that in like 48 minutes
00:38:52.60 --> 00:38:57.60 bro. That's impressive. That's getting after it. Just he
00:38:57.60 --> 00:39:03.60 would love those. Yeah. I listen. How do you not respect that?
00:39:03.60 --> 00:39:07.60 Yeah. I'm flouked. Because back in the day, I would have been like,
00:39:07.60 --> 00:39:13.60 I want to hang out with that here. But it's, I mean, that's just what,
00:39:13.60 --> 00:39:17.60 you know, that's what we do. That's what that is. What that is is
00:39:17.60 --> 00:39:22.60 18 year old human being that's been in boot camp, S. O. I. Hasn't,
00:39:22.60 --> 00:39:27.60 has it let loose at all? And has become a man by the way, or at
00:39:27.60 --> 00:39:31.60 least has been told in some way that he's become a man.
00:39:31.60 --> 00:39:36.60 And that's where still has the boot stripe.
00:39:36.60 --> 00:39:39.60 You know, it's like, bro, you're not falling. You're right. Yeah.
00:39:39.60 --> 00:39:43.60 I get it though. I get it, man, because it's, you get there and it's like,
00:39:43.60 --> 00:39:47.60 okay, did boot did that. That was, you know,
00:39:47.60 --> 00:39:52.60 way more mental than physical. And it's, they're good at what they do.
00:39:52.60 --> 00:39:55.60 Yeah, for sure. They're good at what they do. I remember my grandmother
00:39:55.60 --> 00:40:00.60 telling me, just remember they have a job to do. They're doing their job.
00:40:00.60 --> 00:40:03.60 Now, one thing you go through is going to be personal. She was wrong.
00:40:03.60 --> 00:40:05.60 I don't know if we were with that one. Yeah.
00:40:05.60 --> 00:40:08.60 Grandma was wrong on that guy. Yeah.
00:40:08.60 --> 00:40:11.60 This is the same one. She's, she's a hard woman, man.
00:40:11.60 --> 00:40:16.60 She's, you know, she's, you always say, I suffer from what comes
00:40:16.60 --> 00:40:20.60 up comes out syndrome, because there is no filter.
00:40:20.60 --> 00:40:24.60 Yeah. I love that about her because it was,
00:40:24.60 --> 00:40:27.60 like, if she didn't like it, you knew. Yeah. And she would always say
00:40:27.60 --> 00:40:31.60 as far as I'm concerned, I have one grand baby talking about me right in front of
00:40:31.60 --> 00:40:35.60 my siblings. Her given F tank was bone dry.
00:40:35.60 --> 00:40:39.60 Yeah, give none. This is the same woman.
00:40:39.60 --> 00:40:41.60 At first time, she sees me in the hospital and I'm all being
00:40:41.60 --> 00:40:45.60 up and she says, well, baby, I guess God didn't want you in the double
00:40:45.60 --> 00:40:49.60 one. Have you? And I was like, you know what? I'll take it,
00:40:49.60 --> 00:40:53.60 me, me. Yeah. I mean, I had an old war, two marine,
00:40:53.60 --> 00:40:57.60 a plant Vegas for some event or something, maybe I was,
00:40:57.60 --> 00:40:59.60 I had to speak out or whatever.
00:40:59.60 --> 00:41:05.60 And he said, just remember, I'm in bad br us by the Nobrew.
00:41:05.60 --> 00:41:07.60 I'm a religious dancer. Right on.
00:41:07.60 --> 00:41:11.60 But, um, then it was, you know, boot was,
00:41:11.60 --> 00:41:15.60 was one of those things where you're part of the club, but not like,
00:41:15.60 --> 00:41:17.60 you know, you know, you're, when you're at S.O.I.
00:41:17.60 --> 00:41:21.60 how do they figure out what position you're going to be in a
00:41:21.60 --> 00:41:26.16 So, SOI, it's more of a number of things.
00:41:26.16 --> 00:41:29.04 I scored training as a O3 11 rifleman, right?
00:41:29.04 --> 00:41:31.84 And then, so I go through all the O3 11 rifleman training.
00:41:31.84 --> 00:41:38.88 And you get to, you get to finger most of weapons throughout the infantry.
00:41:38.88 --> 00:41:44.08 And then it was, I never understood the haunts, man.
00:41:45.04 --> 00:41:46.32 I never liked them.
00:41:46.32 --> 00:41:47.60 Always hated them.
00:41:47.60 --> 00:41:52.000 Because it was like, hey, let's go put on a stupid amount of weight.
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.96 Let's go warm up walking around motor T through your four times.
00:41:54.96 --> 00:41:58.80 And look at all the vehicles that we're never going to use.
00:41:58.80 --> 00:42:00.72 Like always feel like we're screwing the taxpayer.
00:42:00.72 --> 00:42:04.80 You know, actually, I can honestly say I have never, ever in my life,
00:42:04.80 --> 00:42:07.44 done what you just said, which is warm up for a hump.
00:42:07.44 --> 00:42:08.64 I've never done that.
00:42:08.64 --> 00:42:12.88 I was always just like, hey, I'll warm up for the first eight hours of this deal.
00:42:12.88 --> 00:42:15.12 Yeah. Well, you know, so I'm going to clean your head.
00:42:15.12 --> 00:42:18.24 You're going to warm up walking around motor T. I like that.
00:42:18.24 --> 00:42:19.68 Take it into the next level.
00:42:19.68 --> 00:42:22.72 It's just, you know, more mind games, Milton Bradley, bro.
00:42:23.76 --> 00:42:26.16 But it was, it was the, the haunts that were like,
00:42:26.88 --> 00:42:33.04 I was just thinking of myself like, why don't we utilize all the stuff with motors in the motors?
00:42:33.04 --> 00:42:35.92 Like that you're walking around the motor train.
00:42:35.92 --> 00:42:38.40 So we're going to have the vehicles are that carry you.
00:42:38.40 --> 00:42:39.60 That's the one.
00:42:39.60 --> 00:42:40.32 Not enough.
00:42:40.32 --> 00:42:41.20 Yeah.
00:42:41.20 --> 00:42:43.20 But that was the, you know, that,
00:42:43.20 --> 00:42:46.16 you know, we finished S.O.I. and we did,
00:42:47.52 --> 00:42:49.28 you know, a lot of the training was, um,
00:42:50.96 --> 00:42:53.76 there were so many times where you would hear the guys,
00:42:54.56 --> 00:42:57.36 see, how we did this 10,000 times yesterday.
00:42:58.16 --> 00:43:00.48 And we're doing it another 10,000 times today.
00:43:01.12 --> 00:43:04.000 Because as you well know, we're all really good.
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.12 No matter the caliber of warrior and the amount of training you have,
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.84 we are all class A bitters.
00:43:10.48 --> 00:43:11.12 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:43:11.12 --> 00:43:14.24 100% you guys can play about everything.
00:43:14.24 --> 00:43:15.20 Everything.
00:43:15.20 --> 00:43:16.16 Everything.
00:43:16.16 --> 00:43:18.80 You know, then we go off to these foreign places and these
00:43:18.80 --> 00:43:20.88 not only situations and we get home and we're like,
00:43:21.44 --> 00:43:22.88 I want to go back to that on this set.
00:43:24.64 --> 00:43:26.80 I know why that is the way it is now.
00:43:26.80 --> 00:43:27.28 Yeah.
00:43:27.28 --> 00:43:28.08 I know now.
00:43:28.48 --> 00:43:31.92 That's just because it's crazy as it is.
00:43:31.92 --> 00:43:32.72 It's easier.
00:43:33.92 --> 00:43:35.68 Oh yeah, well, you got to have some fun with it.
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.68 Yeah, well, you come back here and it's like,
00:43:37.68 --> 00:43:42.88 like, it's just fricking Jerry Springer and the Kardashians.
00:43:42.88 --> 00:43:48.64 Like, just, and it's like, when can we just utilize an ounce of
00:43:48.64 --> 00:43:53.04 condescense, you know, just please for the love of God and all the
00:43:53.04 --> 00:43:53.44 totally.
00:43:55.12 --> 00:43:59.92 Could we just call a dog a dog and a cat and a man be a man and a
00:43:59.92 --> 00:44:03.92 woman be a woman and not worry about everything in between and
00:44:03.92 --> 00:44:06.80 all the judgment that's going to follow being what God made you.
00:44:06.80 --> 00:44:14.56 I could we just focus on toughening up and teaching our children who will
00:44:14.56 --> 00:44:19.92 one day lead this country that believe it or not, the planet
00:44:19.92 --> 00:44:21.60 doesn't give a shit about your feelings.
00:44:22.96 --> 00:44:24.24 You're not always going to win.
00:44:25.12 --> 00:44:27.20 And mommy and daddy are not always going to be there
00:44:28.40 --> 00:44:31.28 deafening you with the rotor wash from their helicopter parenting.
00:44:33.60 --> 00:44:34.80 Like, that's going to go away.
00:44:34.80 --> 00:44:35.04 Yeah.
00:44:35.04 --> 00:44:36.000 Yeah.
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:36.80 Jack.
00:44:36.80 --> 00:44:40.40 Because this world will punch you in the mouth and then laugh.
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.12 What do we teach our kids?
00:44:43.76 --> 00:44:49.92 One of my son knows because I tell him it is my job as your parent
00:44:50.88 --> 00:44:55.20 to make sure you were prepared to take said punch and punch back.
00:44:56.08 --> 00:45:00.48 Because at some point it's going to happen and I would rather you lose
00:45:00.48 --> 00:45:05.92 whether you're in an MMA competition or baseball or whatever it is.
00:45:06.24 --> 00:45:10.72 I would rather you lose doing everything properly at a hundred percent
00:45:11.52 --> 00:45:16.64 than when not doing the fundamentals of the way you're supposed to and going 50%.
00:45:18.96 --> 00:45:21.44 And he looked at me like, well, dad, didn't know.
00:45:21.44 --> 00:45:23.36 Believe it or not, it's not always about winning.
00:45:23.36 --> 00:45:24.72 Because you're going to lose a lot.
00:45:25.60 --> 00:45:26.32 Yeah, it's life.
00:45:27.36 --> 00:45:27.68 Yeah.
00:45:27.68 --> 00:45:31.52 And I mean, it's it's something that's just start young.
00:45:31.52 --> 00:45:35.60 Start young letting them know that it's not all rainbows roses and lollipops.
00:45:36.16 --> 00:45:39.68 That there's no such thing as waking up on your unicorn ranch and picking what you're
00:45:39.68 --> 00:45:42.24 in a corner, you're going to ride on what rainbow to wherever you go.
00:45:43.76 --> 00:45:44.56 The dynamics is this.
00:45:45.28 --> 00:45:46.16 Can you do me favor?
00:45:47.20 --> 00:45:49.44 Can you just the last part about no unicorns?
00:45:49.44 --> 00:45:50.96 Can you not tell my daughter that?
00:45:50.96 --> 00:45:52.08 My eight-year-old daughter?
00:45:52.08 --> 00:45:54.64 Because she's like, yeah, she thinks that's his way to kind of.
00:45:55.28 --> 00:45:57.04 Just setting traps and it's going to happen.
00:45:57.04 --> 00:45:57.92 Imagine that.
00:45:57.92 --> 00:45:58.16 Yeah.
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.32 Hey, so you're done with that.
00:46:02.32 --> 00:46:03.52 So I, yeah.
00:46:03.52 --> 00:46:04.48 Now, I'm now where do you go?
00:46:04.48 --> 00:46:06.64 Because you are you in the reserves at this point?
00:46:06.64 --> 00:46:08.40 Yeah, so I get done with that.
00:46:08.40 --> 00:46:12.000 So why and I go check in and I was late.
00:46:12.64 --> 00:46:13.84 No, that's good call.
00:46:13.84 --> 00:46:14.64 Checking in.
00:46:14.64 --> 00:46:15.44 Yeah, so I didn't.
00:46:16.40 --> 00:46:18.56 It was a communication breakdown, right?
00:46:18.56 --> 00:46:19.04 Sure.
00:46:19.04 --> 00:46:20.24 So I didn't.
00:46:20.24 --> 00:46:21.52 What in my fault?
00:46:21.52 --> 00:46:23.92 No, nothing's, you know, this proof just don't know, sir.
00:46:23.92 --> 00:46:27.92 But it was a situation that the guy checked in with was,
00:46:27.92 --> 00:46:28.88 where were you checking in?
00:46:28.88 --> 00:46:30.48 What were you checking into?
00:46:30.48 --> 00:46:32.48 To my unit and it was in Basea.
00:46:32.48 --> 00:46:33.28 Okay.
00:46:33.28 --> 00:46:34.32 Also known as Bosa.
00:46:34.32 --> 00:46:34.64 Okay.
00:46:34.64 --> 00:46:38.96 So I was supposed to check in with the do that I was in boot,
00:46:38.96 --> 00:46:40.48 or RSOI with.
00:46:40.48 --> 00:46:45.12 I can't remember what to boot together, not, but he goes and checks in.
00:46:45.12 --> 00:46:46.80 I thought Belie was a Friday.
00:46:46.80 --> 00:46:49.68 And so he goes checks on Friday, the first order,
00:46:49.68 --> 00:46:52.16 and then he calls me as like Jake.
00:46:52.16 --> 00:46:55.20 First order, where the hell you are?
00:46:55.20 --> 00:47:01.28 I was like dude, I thought you're, he's like no bro.
00:47:01.28 --> 00:47:02.72 He won't see like now.
00:47:03.92 --> 00:47:06.32 So I'm there Monday morning first thing.
00:47:07.52 --> 00:47:08.80 And he looks at me and was like,
00:47:09.92 --> 00:47:11.04 well, how are you, double-done?
00:47:12.40 --> 00:47:15.52 I was like, sorry for shard,
00:47:15.52 --> 00:47:18.80 you know, so I didn't tell him it and he was like,
00:47:18.80 --> 00:47:21.28 I see you keeper.
00:47:21.28 --> 00:47:24.88 I was like, there's no easy way out of this.
00:47:24.88 --> 00:47:26.72 You know, I look around his office,
00:47:26.72 --> 00:47:28.88 and all of his awards and the accolades.
00:47:28.88 --> 00:47:32.48 And I'm just like, I just asked him like,
00:47:32.48 --> 00:47:36.08 do you, can we just go to the gym and you beat shard?
00:47:36.08 --> 00:47:37.92 You just get this over with.
00:47:37.92 --> 00:47:40.08 And I saw things where,
00:47:40.08 --> 00:47:42.40 where when your dad asked you like,
00:47:42.40 --> 00:47:44.72 no, do you want to be grounded for a month?
00:47:44.72 --> 00:47:46.32 Or do you want the belt?
00:47:46.32 --> 00:47:49.44 10 times out of 10, I'm like, you know what,
00:47:49.44 --> 00:47:50.64 you'll get the belt for you?
00:47:50.64 --> 00:47:53.20 Because that's easier, right?
00:47:53.20 --> 00:47:56.000 Let's just get through the temporary pain
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.08 and then move forward.
00:47:58.08 --> 00:47:59.76 And I was the same with first order,
00:47:59.76 --> 00:48:02.24 which I think in the beginning he liked, you know?
00:48:02.24 --> 00:48:04.24 It's a little, it may be beginning.
00:48:04.24 --> 00:48:06.000 Yeah, yeah, because it was,
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.40 I developed a bit of repetition over time,
00:48:08.40 --> 00:48:12.08 but it was again, liberty, liberty.
00:48:12.88 --> 00:48:14.88 But he was a little that I know
00:48:14.88 --> 00:48:18.72 that I was checking in with now,
00:48:18.72 --> 00:48:21.36 sergeant major, the Marine Corps.
00:48:21.36 --> 00:48:22.08 Oh, damn.
00:48:23.36 --> 00:48:25.36 And I didn't, I had, of course, you know,
00:48:25.36 --> 00:48:27.76 you can't put it in the future, shout out of that.
00:48:27.76 --> 00:48:30.96 And so it was, but he was the one, one of the guys,
00:48:30.96 --> 00:48:32.80 who was, he's just a Marineman.
00:48:32.80 --> 00:48:36.08 He's like, you know, it's like he fell off a poster,
00:48:36.08 --> 00:48:40.08 and there he was, you know, like three red stripe,
00:48:40.08 --> 00:48:44.72 make Matt black belt, and just, I mean, drill master,
00:48:44.72 --> 00:48:46.64 all of you name it, and he did it.
00:48:47.84 --> 00:48:52.88 And so he, we got pretty tight and, you know,
00:48:54.16 --> 00:48:56.64 he displunged me when he had to, but it was,
00:48:56.64 --> 00:48:58.56 one of those things were at the time, my unit,
00:48:58.56 --> 00:49:00.88 when I checked in was actually in Gitmo.
00:49:01.76 --> 00:49:04.24 And they were doing base curdy and all that stuff.
00:49:04.24 --> 00:49:07.84 And then they, he tells me, hey,
00:49:07.84 --> 00:49:12.40 stay close to your phone, you're gonna go meet up
00:49:12.40 --> 00:49:13.52 with your unit in Gitmo.
00:49:13.52 --> 00:49:14.64 Oh my god, I got a Roger that first time.
00:49:14.64 --> 00:49:15.48 I got to go.
00:49:15.48 --> 00:49:16.80 We, we in 2002, yeah.
00:49:16.80 --> 00:49:18.80 This is, yeah, so this is,
00:49:20.40 --> 00:49:22.08 ex-Ausem boot during
00:49:23.52 --> 00:49:26.16 Marine Corps birthday and Christmas.
00:49:26.16 --> 00:49:31.52 Yeah, and so this was, there's flashback to being
00:49:32.08 --> 00:49:35.04 in boot camp for Marine Corps birthday and Christmas.
00:49:35.04 --> 00:49:37.76 Marine Corps birthday, I don't know they still do it.
00:49:37.76 --> 00:49:38.56 I'm sure they do it.
00:49:38.56 --> 00:49:39.40 Oh yeah.
00:49:39.40 --> 00:49:41.92 But they give you stay contripped and like cake in the jowl.
00:49:41.92 --> 00:49:46.40 And so we got back to the barracks and that one dea was telling you about
00:49:47.52 --> 00:49:50.56 who likes pretty gut here's this, because he's, he'll know exactly what I am.
00:49:51.60 --> 00:49:52.72 Come find me, bro.
00:49:52.72 --> 00:49:57.84 And, uh, but we line up, we get online in the squad bay,
00:49:57.84 --> 00:50:00.88 and he makes us, we just finish this epic mill.
00:50:00.88 --> 00:50:04.72 We had more than like a minute and a half to eat.
00:50:04.72 --> 00:50:07.68 That's a sit there for a good five or six minutes,
00:50:08.72 --> 00:50:11.36 which is an eternity at the time.
00:50:11.36 --> 00:50:13.68 We get back online, start pounding canteens,
00:50:13.68 --> 00:50:16.40 hold them up your overhead, run back to the head,
00:50:16.96 --> 00:50:19.68 refill them, get back online, pound the canteens,
00:50:20.88 --> 00:50:24.000 hold them over your head empty, do it again and again and again.
00:50:25.04 --> 00:50:30.72 And he said, we're doing this until every one of you pukes up that mill that you don't deserve.
00:50:30.72 --> 00:50:37.20 Yeah, and so, and we did, and then the first, of course.
00:50:37.20 --> 00:50:41.04 Yeah, chain reaction, the first few weeks and then the starts.
00:50:42.16 --> 00:50:45.36 Like with me, I would rather seriously be
00:50:47.84 --> 00:50:50.72 have like cruel and unusual punishment done to me than pukes.
00:50:51.76 --> 00:50:56.32 So I'm fighting it like, like a moe, like I'm fighting it hard.
00:50:56.32 --> 00:51:03.44 And then the company CO walks in the back door and it was hilarious because
00:51:03.44 --> 00:51:08.96 that said the eye like goes white like, oh, yeah, because he's hazing.
00:51:08.96 --> 00:51:12.24 Yeah, and that's when daddy walks in and sees it,
00:51:12.88 --> 00:51:17.60 just walk by all of us and he's like he had to go back behind the racks
00:51:17.60 --> 00:51:20.08 because he didn't want to get pukes.
00:51:20.80 --> 00:51:23.36 That's the guy's just puking on the deck right in the mill.
00:51:23.36 --> 00:51:27.28 Oh, yeah, that was all. Oh, yeah, because we were just going to deck to all it after the fact
00:51:27.28 --> 00:51:32.96 anyway. But then that was that was, that was I'm sorry.
00:51:33.68 --> 00:51:37.04 We're going to break the. Yeah. So then Chris rolls around, same DIY.
00:51:38.40 --> 00:51:44.24 And it's Chris was Eve. We do our lights out, nitro chesty wherever you are. He opens the door.
00:51:44.24 --> 00:51:46.40 We'll just say it was like Rudolph the Red Nostraine deer.
00:51:47.52 --> 00:51:52.24 Everyone knows it's song, right? So he opens the door the duty hut and all you hear is
00:51:52.24 --> 00:51:55.28 Rudolph the Red. Bam, the door slam.
00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.08 You just hear him go, that's all you get bitches.
00:51:59.76 --> 00:52:05.28 So you hear a lot of these one liners that I got, I stayed in trouble in the Marine Corps for laughing.
00:52:05.28 --> 00:52:08.88 When you're not supposed to lie, like, I have to laugh. It's coming. I can't hold it.
00:52:10.88 --> 00:52:15.52 I immediately lose it. But one of the guys who was already in the targets of the
00:52:15.52 --> 00:52:21.04 D.I started laughing and it was, I think he was gone like a Dan Affleyer. Like it was, yeah.
00:52:21.04 --> 00:52:25.28 But it's just some of these one liners, man. It's like you hear him. It's like where do the
00:52:25.28 --> 00:52:29.44 dudes come up with this? Yeah. But then you see him yelling at trees on the on the base and
00:52:29.44 --> 00:52:35.28 they're like, oh, like they're graded on yelling at a tree. Yeah. Yeah. Who wakes up like I want to do that.
00:52:36.32 --> 00:52:41.76 One wouldn't me. But I checked in the dudes weren't getting me. And I stayed by my phone.
00:52:42.32 --> 00:52:47.28 Phone never rang. So I got, I was, I locked out. So what were you doing in the civilian?
00:52:47.28 --> 00:52:51.12 So were you living as a soldier? So I started doing drill one weekend a month or whatever. I started
00:52:51.12 --> 00:52:55.60 to go like, yeah, I mean, and I was training and getting ready because I knew we were going to go.
00:52:55.60 --> 00:52:59.92 I wreck our Afghanistan just didn't know what to want. You know, it was being in the line,
00:52:59.92 --> 00:53:06.24 you know, you knew you were going to go. And so it was the guys got home and we started training.
00:53:06.24 --> 00:53:14.80 And I'm in school, which went about like high school went and minus the football.
00:53:14.80 --> 00:53:26.56 And then they're on their student. So here it was funny because I realized early on, like I can do this.
00:53:27.68 --> 00:53:35.44 I can do this school, though. The only downfall to that was, is it was like, okay, I've been after this
00:53:35.44 --> 00:53:41.28 for a year. I got my approved myself. I can do this. I don't need to see it through, but it's,
00:53:41.28 --> 00:53:49.36 now I'm just wasting my time. You know, there's a lot of beer to drink. And, you know, typical mindset,
00:53:49.36 --> 00:53:57.52 but my unit gets home and I go and meet the guys, which is like every other, you show up to the
00:53:57.52 --> 00:54:03.20 first time. It's not going to do all the first time. Like you're immediately being sized up. And it's like,
00:54:04.16 --> 00:54:10.16 but I was one of those guys who, like, I was not, I just wasn't going to take a shit. And so it
00:54:10.16 --> 00:54:19.20 went well for me because I was able to use dumb streets in humor to kind of get in with the,
00:54:19.20 --> 00:54:25.28 with the guys who aren't me. And, but they also knew that I loved it. I loved what I did. And so the
00:54:25.28 --> 00:54:31.60 guys get back. And this one guy who's a freaking mortarman, go figure. And he's like, hey,
00:54:31.60 --> 00:54:35.44 shit, you're a big dude. You should be a gunner. You're going to be a gunner. What do you think about
00:54:35.44 --> 00:54:40.32 being a gunner? Well, it doesn't matter. You're going to be a gunner. So it's like, all right, whatever,
00:54:40.32 --> 00:54:46.80 so I'm like 31. Okay, it'll be a gunner. And then we did our first pump with that system.
00:54:46.80 --> 00:54:52.16 Like that. And I was like, I'm going to beat that dude with an inch of his life because I knew
00:54:52.16 --> 00:54:58.64 I could. And I was like, that son of a bitch should not tell me that it came with like a tripod
00:54:58.64 --> 00:55:06.000 and then it was like, oh, it's sucked. But it was, you know, I mean, earning a stripes, you know.
00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.56 But it was one of those things where we were just waiting. But we were a tight unit. We were a tight
00:55:10.56 --> 00:55:17.84 night group. And I think I think that probably had a lot to do with us knowing that it's matter time.
00:55:17.84 --> 00:55:27.04 Right. Right. And most of us weren't prior combat guys. We were a young unit. And it was interesting,
00:55:27.04 --> 00:55:33.12 man, because it was, it was a, it was an eclectic group. And a group, a group from all walks of life,
00:55:33.84 --> 00:55:38.64 which is something that always really admired about the military regardless of what branch or
00:55:38.64 --> 00:55:45.92 special, whatever is that you are forced to communicate and to adapt with other people.
00:55:45.92 --> 00:55:52.88 Because if you don't, you're, you're screwed. Yeah. And that's something that I always appreciated.
00:55:52.88 --> 00:55:57.60 And at the same time, it wore me the hell out because there was some guy, you know, there's some guys
00:55:57.60 --> 00:56:02.32 that you're just like, you know, if I never saw that guy again, it'd be too soon.
00:56:03.52 --> 00:56:10.32 And it's usually just because, you know, it's, well, he's after explained to civilians that I'm
00:56:10.32 --> 00:56:14.08 working with because a lot of people have the impression of civilians that, you know,
00:56:14.08 --> 00:56:17.20 the civilians have the impression that everyone in the military is just like a machine that
00:56:17.20 --> 00:56:20.56 just is going to do it their toll. And if you're the sergeant, the court is going to say,
00:56:20.56 --> 00:56:24.64 this is even, it's like, hmm, not currently doesn't work like that. Like, it'll work like that for a
00:56:24.64 --> 00:56:30.000 little while and work for, you know, little while, but over time, those, those, those young guys
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.32 will, or the junior people, if you're not leading them correctly, you're not going to get things down.
00:56:34.88 --> 00:56:40.56 Oh, you can turn and you should show real quick real quick, real quick because you're also
00:56:40.56 --> 00:56:46.40 dealing with a bunch of dudes that feel like that, that are of the mindset, I can take on this
00:56:46.40 --> 00:56:52.08 world of one hand tied behind my back by myself. You're dealing with that, you know, exactly what
00:56:52.08 --> 00:56:58.32 I'm talking about, those, yeah, I'll for personality are abundant. Yeah, yeah. And then you, you mix in a
00:56:58.32 --> 00:57:02.40 lot of testosterone and stupidity and you have a very dangerous situation.
00:57:03.76 --> 00:57:11.60 Low IQ high T count. We like it. That's basically what it is. It is, but um, now did you guys,
00:57:11.60 --> 00:57:16.16 did you guys do like to, so you're doing one week in a month of drill and then you do
00:57:16.16 --> 00:57:22.88 two weeks in a summer time, but then in what 2003, you guys could call up a 2004.
00:57:22.88 --> 00:57:27.60 I think we got, we got the call in 103. I believe if I'm not mistaken,
00:57:28.32 --> 00:57:32.72 I've been blown up since then and hit in the head a lot. So I don't know, I think we got the call
00:57:32.72 --> 00:57:38.72 in 103 saying that we were going to be called, the certain time and it gave you like a warning order,
00:57:38.72 --> 00:57:42.32 like, okay, it's common pretty much. And then they said, okay, you're going to go do your work
00:57:42.32 --> 00:57:50.64 up in 29 palms. So we, you know, we get to 29 palms and I was like, I remember, man,
00:57:52.32 --> 00:57:59.04 getting off that burden, I was just like, this place sucks. I thought you were going to have
00:57:59.04 --> 00:58:06.80 something really profound to say. No, and you said it to 29 palms, this place sucks. It was,
00:58:06.80 --> 00:58:15.52 I was like, why? Why do, of course the Marines would have this base? Of course. It made total sense.
00:58:16.16 --> 00:58:23.44 You know, it was just like let the bitching begin. It was a bundle, bro. It was a bundle.
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:30.000 Because unless you had money to go to Palm Springs, I'll see it 29 stops. Right out the get some.
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.96 And we are inevitably going to be fighting. This is the amazing thing. This is the amazing thing is
00:58:34.96 --> 00:58:40.96 I got asked, I got asked on the podcast, you know, how do I, you know, my, I checked into a
00:58:40.96 --> 00:58:45.60 battalion or I think it got a company commander that Murau's not good. How do we get them real good?
00:58:45.60 --> 00:58:50.24 Look, do hard things. You want to improve them, or I'll do hard things. And one of the things,
00:58:50.24 --> 00:58:53.52 like, what are you going to do at 29 stumps? What are you going to do there? Well,
00:58:53.52 --> 00:58:56.32 you're going to hang out with each other. That's what you're going to do. It's going to suck.
00:58:56.32 --> 00:58:59.68 You're going to feel, you're going to sweat. It's going to be hot. And you're going to do hard things.
00:58:59.68 --> 00:59:03.84 And you're going to become titers and unit. That's what happens. Yeah, imagine that. Yeah, imagine that.
00:59:03.84 --> 00:59:08.88 Weird. Weird. It's just weird how that works. Now, who is running the training?
00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.88 The ever training cadre out there? So we, uh,
00:59:15.36 --> 00:59:22.48 remember it was, um, or you guys training yourselves or you're, is your officer leading the training
00:59:22.48 --> 00:59:28.32 on the journey sergeant? Yeah, I mean, we had gunny, there was kind of both, right? We had
00:59:28.32 --> 00:59:32.72 like we would go to Mount Town or wherever we would have some mountain structures out there and got it.
00:59:32.72 --> 00:59:39.68 But it wasn't because I mean, a lot of guys were forward to Floyd. Yeah. He were gone. And
00:59:41.44 --> 00:59:49.52 but we, we literally, we trained, we trained hard. I mean, it was, you talk about
00:59:50.48 --> 00:59:54.88 training for the sake of muscle memory. Yeah. We, it was, it was,
00:59:54.88 --> 01:00:01.60 Narlie, what we did. And it was, uh, like you said, we did a lot of hard things through. And then we only
01:00:01.60 --> 01:00:08.96 got tighter and tighter and tighter as a unit. And, but we, it was, uh, I mean, I remember the first time
01:00:08.96 --> 01:00:16.24 we went out to do our first training evolution out of American minds. And we, we humped out there
01:00:16.24 --> 01:00:24.56 of course because you know, don't use the vehicles. And, uh, I remember we staged, we staged our gear.
01:00:24.56 --> 01:00:29.92 And my Patoons are our drops of back. And there's like a, like a little rattle-synced in by
01:00:29.92 --> 01:00:34.64 where you dropped this pack. And so we had to go move. And then he goes to put his back on to move.
01:00:34.64 --> 01:00:40.48 And there's a black scorpion on his back. And I was like, this is awesome. Like this is,
01:00:41.28 --> 01:00:47.44 and then we had a ton of bees that were go after the, the, the water buffalo,
01:00:47.44 --> 01:00:53.12 the trailer, the bigger water trailers. And it was like, we can't, yeah. It's just,
01:00:53.12 --> 01:01:01.04 yeah. It's an evitable Marine Corps shit. Like it's, the, the suck factor is going to be
01:01:01.76 --> 01:01:07.28 peg the entire time. Yeah. And it was, it's, it's like this guy was just looking down on this man.
01:01:07.28 --> 01:01:14.32 Like, hey, you're going to earn it. Yeah. One day I'm going to have this team guy buddy on mine
01:01:14.32 --> 01:01:19.60 on, he's got a lot of rattle snakes and worries from the desert because rattle snakes are very
01:01:19.60 --> 01:01:24.000 amusing. You know, once you start catching them and putting on people's vehicles and putting them in
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.36 there, they're backpacks. Sure. Just stuff like that. Like yeah. That's cool. I'm telling you right now.
01:01:29.36 --> 01:01:35.36 That's good stuff for someone else. I'm not kidding. Yeah. No, it's, it's, you know, we have to see someone
01:01:35.36 --> 01:01:40.000 jump though. Yeah. It does. But hey, you know, they don't know that the fangs have been removed.
01:01:40.56 --> 01:01:43.84 Rip the fangs out. I want to let them in. That's me how much I care.
01:01:43.84 --> 01:01:54.24 You can completely miss the point. It's the principal. Yeah. Snake season. Get some. Dude,
01:01:54.24 --> 01:02:04.48 it was, some of the best. The dark greens did, did, do not like the, the little creatures in the
01:02:04.48 --> 01:02:11.28 creepy crawallies. And seeing some of the reactions to some of the dark greens was, what's the dark
01:02:11.28 --> 01:02:16.08 greens? They're, they're, to be politically correct. They're African American.
01:02:18.08 --> 01:02:22.000 Dark green greens. Got you. Com dark greens. And they know. And they, they're going to
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:26.32 comp, so it's accepted. Right. It doesn't bother them. Do green. They don't write their
01:02:26.32 --> 01:02:33.20 congressmen. It's, it's unbelievable the way that works. So that, there, it's, you know, I got to
01:02:33.20 --> 01:02:40.88 see why I just spoke with this, uh, dill couple days ago. That was yesterday. And one of them
01:02:40.88 --> 01:02:46.24 rings, I served real zir, his dark green. And, uh, man, it was, it was, it was,
01:02:46.64 --> 01:02:51.36 prior to seeing him in a decade. It didn't miss a beat. It was, it was like,
01:02:52.24 --> 01:02:58.000 seriously didn't miss a beat. And I'm like, man, that was, I just can't imagine. Imagine if
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.84 mankind could have a taste to that. Just a taste. It would be, imagine how much better
01:03:04.88 --> 01:03:11.28 this spin and ball chaos would be. But it's, it was awesome. It was just good to see him and,
01:03:12.24 --> 01:03:18.000 and to see the way that he changed. You just see the maturity over time, you know, of, of, of
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:25.52 how life can, it, it authors your course and authors your mindset because of the things you experience
01:03:25.52 --> 01:03:31.36 and you go through and, and the how many times you're taught how human you are, you know,
01:03:31.36 --> 01:03:36.72 it was, it was, it was cool. It was good for the soul, you know, and, uh, yeah, it was just cool to
01:03:36.72 --> 01:03:41.76 see him and be able to embrace that dude. I mean, I, that's my family. That is, I don't give
01:03:41.76 --> 01:03:47.60 a shit what color his skin is. That dude's my blood. And that's just the way it is. It's way it always
01:03:47.60 --> 01:03:55.76 will be. But we, um, and he used to, he used to know the shit out of me. Like I used to thought
01:03:55.76 --> 01:04:03.36 of saying like his, his mouth is never going to shut. Like one of these days, man, one of these days.
01:04:04.40 --> 01:04:10.96 And, uh, but it was so epic because it was like, that's my bro, you know, and it was, it was just awesome.
01:04:10.96 --> 01:04:17.52 Man, it just goes to show you like, we get these little reminders in life. If, if you
01:04:17.52 --> 01:04:23.60 just shut your mouth and listen, you get these little reminders of how worth it. Everything's been
01:04:24.40 --> 01:04:29.76 and what purpose everything is served. And it was cool to see that I got one of those.
01:04:29.76 --> 01:04:37.04 You know, and it gives me, it was a little fuel for the soul to, to keep going. But, um, I remember
01:04:37.04 --> 01:04:44.96 this, our, our first loss was in, uh, March Air Force Base, who we were doing house house fighting
01:04:44.96 --> 01:04:52.24 in the band in housing unit in March Air Force Base. And it was, um, it was a training loss because
01:04:52.24 --> 01:05:00.80 of a guy that they were practicing J-turns and a Humvee. And, uh, there's a young kid, you, you
01:05:00.80 --> 01:05:07.84 wouldn't our company. He was a different company, um, same Italian. And the Humvee flipped.
01:05:08.80 --> 01:05:12.88 And he was, there's the inertia of the Humvee flip and he couldn't get out of the turret.
01:05:12.88 --> 01:05:18.24 And, uh, it was up armoured. And so when it flips, it obviously kills the gunner.
01:05:19.04 --> 01:05:23.60 There's no way he's going to get out. And so, mandatory 24 hours sake stand down
01:05:24.32 --> 01:05:29.04 to take our phones and all that stuff. And, you know, hey, don't write home, don't call anyone.
01:05:29.04 --> 01:05:38.48 This is, you know, we got a little bite by the SOP. That was, uh, uh, you know, that was, uh,
01:05:38.48 --> 01:05:45.04 one of, like, and then I opening Dillman. That was like, okay, this is the real Dill. Like, this,
01:05:45.04 --> 01:05:51.12 we're not, this is a life-and-dev game we're playing. And I'll never forget when we got back
01:05:51.12 --> 01:05:55.60 to 20 on bombs, which I don't remember for a couple days later, three days later, day later, or whatever.
01:05:56.56 --> 01:06:01.76 But we wake up and we go to formation. And we walk out to go to formation and, um,
01:06:01.76 --> 01:06:07.76 and, um, then everywhere you look, you saw a piece of computer paper, just a regular piece of paper,
01:06:08.48 --> 01:06:12.32 turn horizontally, they were taped all over the place. Everywhere you looked,
01:06:13.36 --> 01:06:18.88 and all he said on him was complacency kills. Every where you looked, you saw that complacency
01:06:18.88 --> 01:06:26.56 kills. And gunning it just printed out all these papers. And that, to this day, that sticks with me.
01:06:26.56 --> 01:06:33.52 And I think about it, not every all the time, because we all get complacent.
01:06:35.04 --> 01:06:40.88 But it could not be more true, whether it's literal, you know, or figuratively speaking, I mean,
01:06:40.88 --> 01:06:46.08 and of course, most of our lives nowadays, you get complacent. Yeah, you might not die,
01:06:47.36 --> 01:06:52.96 but something can be irreversibly damaged. Well, yeah, I mean, I talk about that all the time,
01:06:52.96 --> 01:06:56.80 they're just just the complacency, even the complacency on the little things in life.
01:06:56.80 --> 01:07:00.32 That's just put you down the wrong path. Well, that's just the way it is. That's the reality.
01:07:00.32 --> 01:07:07.76 Hey, man, and let me tell you that, um, I could be referred to as Captain complacency when it comes to that.
01:07:08.64 --> 01:07:11.28 I'll be the first to tell you that I'm much more centered than saying,
01:07:12.48 --> 01:07:19.68 I always say, you know, that God gave you the only son to suffer and down across as
01:07:19.68 --> 01:07:24.88 any of those are going to be guys like me. The only differences I'm going to admit it,
01:07:25.92 --> 01:07:31.68 you know, I'm going to own my flawedness. And I say all the time that I've stood with everything from
01:07:31.68 --> 01:07:36.000 leaders of mankind, the presidents to the most savage individuals you'll ever meet and everything in
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.36 between the one common denominator is everyone I'm equally fundamentally flawed.
01:07:42.48 --> 01:07:45.52 Every single one. Yeah, no doubt about that. They just have different clothes on.
01:07:45.52 --> 01:07:52.72 That's it. That's what I'm saying, man, if we could stop, if we could just stop with this political
01:07:52.72 --> 01:08:03.84 correctness and this false manufactured protection, we could get, I always say, if we, if you
01:08:03.84 --> 01:08:09.60 took out self-interest and self-gain and the fight for the greater good, imagine where we would be right now.
01:08:09.60 --> 01:08:15.52 Imagine where we would be, because we would be leaves and bounds ahead of where we are.
01:08:16.72 --> 01:08:22.88 We would be light years ahead of where we are. If there was nothing to begin to help someone
01:08:22.88 --> 01:08:29.60 that you've never met and that can never repay you, you just do it. Because we've been so
01:08:29.60 --> 01:08:36.96 conditioned to be selfish. And it's unfortunate because it's what I love about this guy,
01:08:36.96 --> 01:08:42.40 as a, for all it says, it purves is the godfather of the Marine Corps. People can say,
01:08:43.44 --> 01:08:48.88 he may have been arrogant or pompous or whatever. But I guarantee he was the last one to eat.
01:08:49.60 --> 01:08:53.60 Yeah, I mean, he was definitely the last one to eat. And actually that books are great book and
01:08:54.96 --> 01:08:59.52 there's a, there's a, there's a, there's a big difference between his reputation of what people
01:08:59.52 --> 01:09:04.40 thought about him that never worked with him. People that worked with him, the, the marines that
01:09:04.40 --> 01:09:08.48 worked with him that served with him, that he would go around their foxholes at night in negative
01:09:08.48 --> 01:09:16.40 25 degree weather and ask guys if they're okay and give him a shot of whiskey. I mean, he, they
01:09:16.40 --> 01:09:21.36 loved him because he cared about those, be cared about them. That's the, the image, as a matter
01:09:21.36 --> 01:09:26.56 fact, like he had this driver that was with him for a long time. Jones was his last name. And
01:09:26.80 --> 01:09:31.12 Jones, people would come up and say, how did you stay with Chester Polar for so long? Didn't he
01:09:31.12 --> 01:09:36.64 chew you out and demote you and he's like, no, the guy never yelled at me ever. That's, that's the
01:09:36.64 --> 01:09:42.000 difference. That's the difference between, that's the dichotomy between what this image was and what he
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.76 was really like. The people who he would, the reason he had a reputation for being, you know, super
01:09:50.72 --> 01:09:55.84 I guess I guess direct with people was the way he went up the chain of command. When he would tell
01:09:55.84 --> 01:09:59.92 an admiral out on a ship, like you better put those bombs when we need him right now or, you know,
01:09:59.92 --> 01:10:04.40 he'll, I'll up the chain of command or he'd come back to America and say, hey, the binoculars that
01:10:04.40 --> 01:10:09.60 you're building suck and they, and they steam up and we can't see anything. What's wrong with you?
01:10:09.60 --> 01:10:14.56 So that's where he got the reputation. But down the chain of command, he, he was not like that. There's
01:10:14.56 --> 01:10:18.08 another great story in there that I cover on the podcast where he catches a guy sleeping and
01:10:18.08 --> 01:10:22.88 watch that are training. And he wakes the guy, guy up and he's the batiling commander. He wakes the guy
01:10:22.88 --> 01:10:27.04 up and says, hey, what are you doing sleeping? What if your captain would have caught you? He would have,
01:10:27.04 --> 01:10:31.12 he would have had me come and caught Marshal you. He'd been in the disaster. He got to stay wake old man.
01:10:31.12 --> 01:10:36.32 That's his nickname for everyone was old man. But that's the difference is he cared, he cared so
01:10:36.32 --> 01:10:41.84 much about his men. And, and you know, that's the, that's the incredibly hard part that we were
01:10:41.84 --> 01:10:49.04 talking about earlier is like when he's when his son comes home from Vietnam and, you know,
01:10:49.04 --> 01:10:54.88 he's like, his heart is broken. It's broken and he can't even speak and he can't he's just
01:10:54.88 --> 01:11:00.64 convulsing with tears. And it's because, you know, he loved his son, but his son was represented
01:11:00.64 --> 01:11:06.08 of a very marine and he said that. You know, he said that, it was like that, that the closing that
01:11:06.08 --> 01:11:10.24 book, you know, he tells his wife, his wife says, what do you want to do now that it's all over?
01:11:10.24 --> 01:11:15.76 And he's like, I want to see the face of every marine I have a server with. Dude, you know,
01:11:15.76 --> 01:11:22.72 I mean, that right there. For anyone who's listening to this and questioning,
01:11:22.72 --> 01:11:28.48 what is my purpose? Why am I alive? Why am I here? What's the point?
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.72 Two things. And it's the same for every individual no matter what country no matter what little
01:11:36.72 --> 01:11:44.24 village doesn't matter. We all have our here to do two things. Love and be loved.
01:11:46.80 --> 01:11:50.96 That's it. Everything else is filler. Love and be loved.
01:11:50.96 --> 01:11:59.04 That's it. It's hard to shit because we make it hard to shit. That's it.
01:12:00.64 --> 01:12:08.08 When he saw his son that all came crashing down on him, that's it. It was reality.
01:12:09.12 --> 01:12:15.76 It was one of those like in rather it was in Lewis' situation where
01:12:15.76 --> 01:12:20.88 when you're severely wounded or you lose someone that you loved tremendously.
01:12:22.88 --> 01:12:30.96 I mean with reckless abandonment, you love all the way. And if you're of the right
01:12:30.96 --> 01:12:35.52 warrior mindset or first responder law enforcement, you've been around that and you're the real
01:12:35.52 --> 01:12:44.000 deal. You're probably just like me or you're you're incapable of loving halfway. They're incapable
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:54.000 of it because if we did that, we're taking away from that in which we're supposed to be true to
01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:01.76 in the honor. And that's the point. You don't get a piece of humble pie. You and hell the factory.
01:13:02.56 --> 01:13:09.44 All that wants. And that's just what it is. And some guys don't come out of that.
01:13:09.44 --> 01:13:15.04 You know, and if I if I wouldn't surrounded by people that were better than me
01:13:16.48 --> 01:13:25.28 and that refused to love me to death, I would be loose. And far be it for me to sit here and
01:13:25.28 --> 01:13:33.28 look at you and say, not an option. It's not an option. Because one thing I've learned in this fight
01:13:33.28 --> 01:13:40.48 is fight of mental health and of this floating noodle in between our ears. Is that no one gets a
01:13:40.48 --> 01:13:48.08 pass? Nobody gets a pass. I don't care who you are, what you've been through, what you know,
01:13:48.08 --> 01:13:56.72 who you know, you don't get a pass. And I've learned that the hard way from having to bury friends
01:13:56.72 --> 01:14:08.16 over and over and over and over and to talk myself out of you're not worth it. It would be easier
01:14:09.04 --> 01:14:16.40 for them if you weren't here. And letting the demons get the better of me. Because it's a constant
01:14:17.12 --> 01:14:22.16 dance. Like when people say, oh, well, you know, Jake, you're practically a lot of pressure off.
01:14:22.16 --> 01:14:30.000 You just work on your work and in life balance. Because it's, you're just going to find your balance.
01:14:31.60 --> 01:14:35.84 Okay, here's some news. There is no balance. It's a constant dance.
01:14:37.20 --> 01:14:43.28 You're constantly trying to figure it out. It's just like our enemies and our rack up,
01:14:43.28 --> 01:14:47.76 guys, they're like, it's, we change our taxes, they change theirs. We change ours, they change theirs.
01:14:47.76 --> 01:14:54.000 We change ours. It's a constant dance. It's never finite. Right? Nothing is.
01:14:55.84 --> 01:15:00.80 That's one of the things that makes life worth living. I don't want to wake up tomorrow and know
01:15:00.80 --> 01:15:07.60 what tomorrow has in store for me. What's the point? I just want to wake up and love and be loved.
01:15:09.20 --> 01:15:16.16 All the way, not halfway. Be hotter, be cold. If you're lukewarm, get the hell out of my foxhole.
01:15:16.16 --> 01:15:25.60 I don't want to fight with you. Let's talk about when you went on deployment now.
01:15:26.56 --> 01:15:35.44 So it's 2004 is when you deploy like the summer of 2004? Yeah. And where do you guys deploy to?
01:15:36.16 --> 01:15:44.40 So we are primary. It was the SUNY triangle of our rack. Beautiful, beautiful place.
01:15:44.40 --> 01:15:48.80 Yeah. We landed in Kuwait. We only in Kuwait. I think they call it camp.
01:15:48.80 --> 01:15:53.12 Victory may be. I can't remember the name of it. It was before the pizza hots and subways and all that.
01:15:53.12 --> 01:16:00.16 I know that for a fact. But we landed in Kuwait. We're only there for a couple days.
01:16:02.16 --> 01:16:08.24 We get on the burden on the fricates. This was on the on the tarmac in Kuwait getting ready to flow
01:16:08.24 --> 01:16:19.36 our outside. And I think if I'm not mistaken, I think we were on the first three, see one,
01:16:19.36 --> 01:16:26.96 30s we got on. We had to get off of because they weren't mechanically sound or whatever.
01:16:28.80 --> 01:16:33.92 Or just gunny just follow. Who knows? But we had to get off of minute one gunny.
01:16:33.92 --> 01:16:40.32 Because I remember the fourth one and we're all sweating. Our asses off. It's miserable. Yeah.
01:16:40.32 --> 01:16:46.72 It's miserable. And I remember the fourth one. I don't know if it was the crew chief,
01:16:46.72 --> 01:16:51.68 the loadmaster, whoever, but gunny took someone somewhere and I'm pretty sure
01:16:52.88 --> 01:16:58.24 it was a conversation pretty much like if this burden didn't take off, you're not going to go home.
01:16:58.24 --> 01:17:10.96 A life anyway. Because it sucked. We have everything on. We're from Marine. So we're geared out.
01:17:11.76 --> 01:17:17.84 And it's was stuff we'll never use. Never. But it was on the gear list. Yeah, got to have it.
01:17:19.44 --> 01:17:24.000 So we, but we ended up landed in the outside and I remember when we got off the burden, I was
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:35.68 so I thought to myself, man, 20 and I'm pausing that bad. Yeah. And I was out of do that
01:17:35.68 --> 01:17:46.40 two year. I miss it already. And so we get off and we go to our tent where we're sleeping with our
01:17:46.40 --> 01:17:56.08 bunk beds. And we start the brief the next day. And I remember we were... So is that where you
01:17:56.08 --> 01:18:00.64 guys were going to be working out of? Where you guys are actually going to be camp at station to add
01:18:00.64 --> 01:18:06.80 alasad primarily? Yeah, but I mean, rarely got to stay on the ground. That's where your
01:18:06.80 --> 01:18:13.44 headquarters were. Yeah, we're batiny. Okay. So we start the 40-hour brief.
01:18:13.44 --> 01:18:22.16 We're in the middle of that and Captain walks in. We're one of the hangers.
01:18:23.76 --> 01:18:29.92 And you know, look on his face that you know, someone good, obviously. And it was because
01:18:29.92 --> 01:18:36.56 during the lefcee rice seat of the unit we were placing got hit. And they lost. I don't want
01:18:36.56 --> 01:18:42.32 to miss quoted, but one of the guys I was just with this past week and was there.
01:18:42.32 --> 01:18:48.96 And that unit, we were placed two seven. And it was they had lost like an XO
01:18:49.68 --> 01:18:54.48 first sergeant. Like it was bad. That's from one that was an ID strike.
01:18:54.48 --> 01:19:01.84 It was ID with that direction. It was just a bad situation.
01:19:01.84 --> 01:19:07.12 Yeah. After action. So they took fire and it was not like it wasn't isolated of that.
01:19:07.12 --> 01:19:13.36 They hit ID goes and then they fight with RPGs. Gotcha. It was a
01:19:13.36 --> 01:19:16.72 gnarly situation. They shouldn't have been in because it happened in a place that was
01:19:18.16 --> 01:19:26.16 friendly. And at the time actually when we were over there, I don't even, I think we still
01:19:26.16 --> 01:19:30.72 call them roadside bomb. I don't even think we call them Ideja. I don't think we utilized that terminology.
01:19:30.72 --> 01:19:38.08 Yeah. If I'm not mistaken, again, I could be wrong what's happened before. But we, so we hear this.
01:19:38.08 --> 01:19:44.24 And it, I mean, it's just like really cool. Yeah, that's not good. That stuff's not supposed to happen.
01:19:45.28 --> 01:19:54.96 And so that was another big awakening moment, right? And but we get ready to leave.
01:19:54.96 --> 01:20:03.52 And at this time, I'm a machine gun team leader. A little that I know I'd become leader
01:20:03.52 --> 01:20:10.96 of the react team. Same as QRF, quick reaction force. So we, we have like the 16th
01:20:10.96 --> 01:20:18.24 vehicle convoy or something. Which would be a huge no-no nowadays. And I remember the
01:20:18.24 --> 01:20:22.48 server walk behind. It was like, hey, shit, we need someone to man that peg on the lead vehicle.
01:20:22.48 --> 01:20:28.24 And we're going to get behind the 240 on the lead vehicle. And I was like, who's going to jump on that pick?
01:20:28.96 --> 01:20:34.32 And we were just in brief hearing about Godwires. They put Godwires across the road, trying to
01:20:34.32 --> 01:20:46.16 to capitate gunners. And I left my first deployment in, I want to say, April or May of 2004. So
01:20:46.16 --> 01:20:51.36 this is, I mean, right. Yeah. Yeah. And I was just trying to think if we were using the term ID and I'm
01:20:51.36 --> 01:20:57.36 almost positive, we work. Because I remember, I remember, but you guys are special. Yeah, I know
01:20:57.36 --> 01:21:02.48 I know, but I was trying to think I remember like, I'm actually envisioning a slide. We caught an ID
01:21:02.48 --> 01:21:10.88 maker. And we had all this like, yeah, wires. And he had like clocks, like multiple clocks from a
01:21:11.76 --> 01:21:20.24 from like a timers, like kitchen timers. And he's we had wires, kitchen timers, all this stuff.
01:21:20.24 --> 01:21:24.56 And they're like, hey, this guy you caught, he's an innocent guy. And I was like, well, no. And they
01:21:24.56 --> 01:21:28.56 say, well, no, he's innocent. What evidence do you have? And I brought these pictures and I'm like,
01:21:28.56 --> 01:21:33.92 look at the stuff that we took off this target. It's all ID stuff. And they were like, oh, okay. But it was
01:21:33.92 --> 01:21:38.24 the first, it was kind of first starting to assemble the idea that people were building these
01:21:38.24 --> 01:21:42.24 improvised explosive devices. I think we were using it, but you're right, might not have spread
01:21:42.24 --> 01:21:48.000 the Marine Corps yet at this point. We're kind of slow. But we're deadly. I mean, I don't know,
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:54.64 we might have. It was a long time ago. That's irrelevant. But because roadside bombs, that wasn't good enough.
01:21:54.64 --> 01:21:58.56 Yeah. So it was called an ID. Well, if it's not, if you don't have a don't bring them, don't
01:21:58.56 --> 01:22:05.92 turn it up. Don't turn it up. But we, so we, but we're out there. We have our convoy. And
01:22:07.52 --> 01:22:15.12 so I asked the guys, okay, who's going to go man that pig is crickets. I was like, oh, very well.
01:22:15.12 --> 01:22:20.80 Oh, I got it. I looked out and was like, hey, sir, I got it. I'm going to do it. Then of course. I
01:22:20.80 --> 01:22:29.44 know, oh, okay. No, I'm like, no, a few, a few, a few, a few, a few. When I die, yeah, just remember what
01:22:29.44 --> 01:22:37.84 your letter needs to say. Because you were of a JJ. And let's see, a lot more colorful,
01:22:37.84 --> 01:22:45.76 good. But I jumped up there, man. And it was, look, the pocket factor, pegged. You know,
01:22:45.76 --> 01:22:50.24 pegged. Because I'm like, how do you see a God wire? I can you see the God wire? It is the sun.
01:22:50.24 --> 01:22:55.28 How to be hit in a certain way. Like, what is, what am I looking for? You know, you had, do you have
01:22:55.28 --> 01:23:01.04 armored homies? No, most of them weren't. Yeah. And, you know, the most of them were two to our soft
01:23:01.04 --> 01:23:05.36 thoughts. Yeah, I get something like that. We had the turret was the turret. Just weird. Like six
01:23:05.36 --> 01:23:08.16 on. And the vehicles of six. That's better. That's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's
01:23:08.16 --> 01:23:12.72 because we're comfortable. I mean, I'd rather be in that than a Humvee if I'm in the lead vehicle.
01:23:12.72 --> 01:23:20.16 I'd rather be in a hair year. But it was, but we, that's why you signed up for an infantry
01:23:20.16 --> 01:23:25.44 get saw. That's right. And we hated, and, you know, the pilots, it was like they were bunching
01:23:25.92 --> 01:23:32.32 pre-medums. And we would see him come in and land and go to their air condition cans. And then
01:23:32.32 --> 01:23:37.76 we're like, you know, they're eating steak and shrimp. You know, they're, they're all comfortable
01:23:37.76 --> 01:23:46.64 in there. And they're swan they're sleep number bed. So, you know, you make all this stuff up in your head.
01:23:46.64 --> 01:23:50.56 Dude, I'll tell you what, you made that up in your head. We had a World War II pilot on here.
01:23:50.56 --> 01:23:57.84 Jim Kunkl. And he was literally saying, like, hey, the, the war in Europe for me, he was a P38 pilot.
01:23:57.84 --> 01:24:02.08 He's like, my mission's working. It like, 45 minutes. He's like, they're almost back in on the
01:24:02.08 --> 01:24:06.08 back in base. Now, of course, those 45 minutes were pretty sketchy. You ended up getting shot down.
01:24:06.08 --> 01:24:10.80 But, you know, a lot of the missions that he did is exactly what you said. That's the reality of
01:24:10.80 --> 01:24:18.16 being a pilot. That's the reality of it. And it's, you know, and then, but until you need them,
01:24:18.16 --> 01:24:22.72 oh, God, yeah. Well, yeah, of course. And then the first time that happened, you're like, oh,
01:24:22.72 --> 01:24:27.60 I can't hook you. Yeah, we need those guys. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. But it's interesting because it's a,
01:24:27.60 --> 01:24:33.04 there's a line guy. You know, it was a grunt. I mean, you're trained from day one. Every other job
01:24:33.04 --> 01:24:38.48 in the United States military is to support you. Yeah, that's true. You know, you're trained that,
01:24:38.48 --> 01:24:44.000 which, I'm not, I mean, I won't say if I agree, you're just agree with it now, because I,
01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.20 it's like I tell civilians like, think of them of the military as a giant will with a lot of
01:24:49.20 --> 01:25:00.000 spokes. Combat guys are like a super small portion of one spoke. Yeah. It takes a lot of moving parts
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.04 to make this machine turn. That's true. And so it's, it's, rather it's in support. Like,
01:25:05.04 --> 01:25:10.000 listen, I'm over that. I don't need, I don't need that anymore. Like I understand why guys think that
01:25:10.72 --> 01:25:15.92 I understand the mindset. There's a, there's a great, I was listening to some hack worth talking
01:25:15.92 --> 01:25:20.72 Colonel David Hackworth and one of the things that he said, he was trying to explain how many people
01:25:20.72 --> 01:25:26.72 were in combat Vietnam in combat. And it was like 10% of the troops. So at the peak of Vietnam,
01:25:26.72 --> 01:25:32.64 there was 560,000 people in country in Vietnam and like 50,000 of them were actually engaged in combat
01:25:32.64 --> 01:25:38.64 at that at any one time. And that's, you know, probably a pretty good figure. A lot of the world,
01:25:38.64 --> 01:25:43.12 where one world to world war two statistics are the same. It's like 10 to one. There's 10 support
01:25:43.12 --> 01:25:47.36 people for every one person that's going to like close close with and destroy the enemy.
01:25:47.36 --> 01:25:55.28 No, no, no, no. It is. Yeah. I mean, it's, I would never look at a supply guy or of course,
01:25:55.28 --> 01:26:00.40 when I was in, I did all the time. I'm like, I put up no chips, put up you bait or whatever.
01:26:00.40 --> 01:26:04.96 This loop is shit as what you say. But like I, I see him now and it's like, hey, I'm
01:26:04.96 --> 01:26:08.80 how pretty sure he's like, oh, well, I couldn't, I didn't do anything like, and I'm like, hey,
01:26:08.80 --> 01:26:18.24 first of all, there is no Richter skill on painted suffering. You know, what makes it unique is that
01:26:18.24 --> 01:26:27.44 it's unique to the individual. You can't grade it. So like your, you know, your spring to ankle
01:26:27.44 --> 01:26:33.44 when you were, you roll your ankle playing basketball there in your lunch hour. How do you know
01:26:33.44 --> 01:26:39.52 that didn't hurt as bad is my 50-intimey to come out of my left leg? It might have.
01:26:41.52 --> 01:26:46.88 Question you a little bit on that one, but the point, the, how the hell did we get talking about this?
01:26:46.88 --> 01:26:51.68 Hey, support people in the military. They do a great job. Then we wouldn't, the front line
01:26:51.68 --> 01:26:55.12 troops wouldn't be able to do anything without them. So that's what I'm saying. And vice versa,
01:26:55.12 --> 01:26:58.56 if the front line troops weren't there, the, the support people would have no job. That's the
01:26:58.56 --> 01:27:03.84 attitude I always had. And we were a team that had to cover move together. And if the intel people
01:27:03.84 --> 01:27:09.44 didn't supply the intel and if the, if the CDs didn't build the bases and keep the generators running
01:27:09.44 --> 01:27:13.84 and the combat engineers were not clearing it. I mean, it's like, it takes a try. Exactly. And so that's
01:27:13.84 --> 01:27:20.80 my point. And that's like, listen, if you're still in and you're in a non-combat role, be proud of what you're
01:27:20.80 --> 01:27:25.92 done. Yeah, no, you're proud of. You know, I have guys that I meet now and they say, well, I was in from,
01:27:25.92 --> 01:27:30.72 you know, 84 to 90. And I never did anything. I was like, hey, you did what your country asked you to do.
01:27:30.72 --> 01:27:39.92 Yeah, you know, I stopped at that mindset, man. You've been conditioned just to call it what it is.
01:27:39.92 --> 01:27:46.72 My guys like I used to be to believe you didn't do anything. Okay, well, the more mature me,
01:27:46.72 --> 01:27:52.48 still pretty dumb, but the more mature me is here to tell you, thank you for carrying the flag
01:27:52.48 --> 01:27:58.16 before I did. Yeah. Yeah. That's another for it is like, who is going to train you? Who's the
01:27:58.16 --> 01:28:03.12 D.I.s that put you through boot camp? And who's the guys that train them? They're in 1984, right?
01:28:03.12 --> 01:28:08.08 You know what I mean? It's like, yeah, long chain. It's a gift that keeps on giving, you know. And it's,
01:28:08.08 --> 01:28:14.48 but he served. You're doing more than most. You know, you're doing more than most. Be proud of that
01:28:14.48 --> 01:28:21.68 fact. And so, but I, but I remember being, we, we leave the wire for the first time in Alessad
01:28:21.68 --> 01:28:29.12 and so we had guys driving the sixth time that, that were motor to you guys that weren't our
01:28:29.12 --> 01:28:35.36 guys. So I didn't know him. It was like a, I don't know if he's like a Lance Koolie and then there's
01:28:35.36 --> 01:28:39.84 like a staff sergeant and they had driver seat and I'm up on the turret, right? And so I'm just like,
01:28:39.84 --> 01:28:48.88 all right, whatever. And so we're coming, we come out of the gate and we bang a left and we're
01:28:48.88 --> 01:28:55.52 headed to our first checkpoint, which by the way, the Iragonash Garden Iragon police knew.
01:28:55.52 --> 01:28:59.36 What are our checkpoints were when we were leaving when we're gonna get there? So that's awesome.
01:28:59.36 --> 01:29:04.16 Yeah, because, you know, there's some really, really smart people in DC that thought that was a good idea.
01:29:04.16 --> 01:29:12.80 And yeah, so that obviously that, that standard operating procedure didn't last for a long
01:29:12.80 --> 01:29:20.96 because we knew it was about idea and but you know, we're had to get back to them like, hey,
01:29:20.96 --> 01:29:27.04 bombs and stuff, just follow us everywhere we go. It's weird. It's almost like they know we're going
01:29:27.04 --> 01:29:37.04 to be there. Imagine that, you know. And so I remember, I could take some type of contact right
01:29:37.04 --> 01:29:45.36 and I'm, I'm weird vehicle and the dude and the driver stops in the middle of a bridge.
01:29:46.56 --> 01:29:53.52 And I just think of a member in training. Do not stop on a bridge. And so I'm telling us
01:29:53.52 --> 01:29:58.96 do like get off the bridge. And he's like looking at the staff sergeant, German saloon,
01:29:58.96 --> 01:30:06.000 like, what the hell do you see on that mean? And so I start taking them in his home, like get off the
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.16 bridge. And that's the assorted news. That's where it's like, dude, just get off the bridge.
01:30:10.16 --> 01:30:18.16 I was like a good idea. Yeah. And so it was, um, new eye cap check or push. Yeah, I do. We got off the bridge.
01:30:18.16 --> 01:30:25.44 And I'm like, hey, genius, how do you know that that thing wasn't going to blow?
01:30:25.44 --> 01:30:32.48 Well, don't stop on a bridge ever. Your motor T. I just shocked that someone didn't tell you,
01:30:32.48 --> 01:30:40.08 don't stop on a bridge because you're you're sitting duck. Yeah. And it's like, that was my like
01:30:40.08 --> 01:30:48.24 welcome to high rack moment when it was, um, and man, we just started everything after that
01:30:49.12 --> 01:30:54.40 pretty pretty much as blurs together. And until the day that we got told that we were going to
01:30:54.40 --> 01:31:00.16 go to do lab, which was for all intents of purposes of an ammo dump was pretty much what
01:31:00.16 --> 01:31:05.92 do lab was. And that's where we were, you know, surgeons were going to get on exploded ordinance.
01:31:05.92 --> 01:31:12.72 And I mean, thousands and thousands of thousands of RPGs, you know, AKs, 7.62 rounds,
01:31:12.72 --> 01:31:18.64 mortars, I mean thousands. And we had to combat engineers out there all day, every day,
01:31:18.64 --> 01:31:24.16 I'm blowing stuff. I mean, they just couldn't blow it quick enough because we would find so many
01:31:24.16 --> 01:31:31.76 of these weapon cash was everywhere. It was insane. And so, but we go through, we get to up to the
01:31:31.76 --> 01:31:39.04 point of, you know, it's a little after our moth that we're there and we get the order that we're going
01:31:39.04 --> 01:31:45.12 to go to do lab, which for most of us was like, okay, so we can breathe some kickback time,
01:31:45.12 --> 01:31:51.76 relax. I had a bad feeling about it. Right my gut as soon as they told us, I heard do lab and
01:31:51.76 --> 01:31:56.32 I knew it was our turn to go, this is actually the primary do lab about. I had a, I got a bad feeling
01:31:56.32 --> 01:32:04.40 of my gut, but know what it was. And so my role was when I left, when I left the states,
01:32:04.40 --> 01:32:12.88 and I told my family, hey, listen, here's the deal. Don't send me anything. Don't write me.
01:32:12.88 --> 01:32:18.32 I'm not going to write you. Don't watch the news and no news is good news. I'll see you in seven
01:32:18.32 --> 01:32:23.92 months. Because in my mind, I had a job to do and I didn't need them in my head with their first
01:32:23.92 --> 01:32:30.48 world bullshit. And because my family puts the jury in springer, and so definitely didn't need that.
01:32:31.36 --> 01:32:35.52 And so that was my mindset. But we get, we're told we're going to do lab, so I get this
01:32:35.52 --> 01:32:41.52 weird feeling of my gut. And I'm like, damn, why don't know what that is? It's the night before we
01:32:41.52 --> 01:32:49.20 head out and you know, get a shower and a hot shower and I'm walking back to our tent from the
01:32:49.20 --> 01:32:57.52 shower trailer and a walk by Gunny. And Gunny, you just saw it to Gunny, man. He used like a 23-year
01:32:57.52 --> 01:33:04.72 gunny, and he earned it. And I loved them. Everybody loved them. You know, and he was one of the guys
01:33:04.72 --> 01:33:09.60 where if you tell him good morning, and he didn't tell you, if he said, if you don't hear
01:33:09.60 --> 01:33:17.36 something back like, go after your mom, if you hear like good morning back, Gunny, he's pissed about
01:33:17.36 --> 01:33:22.08 something and it's going to be a long day. But like if you're like, go after your mom, you're like
01:33:22.08 --> 01:33:29.76 sweets, Gunny's in a good mood. He's just, he was that guy, you know, and everybody loved them.
01:33:29.76 --> 01:33:34.96 Everybody respected them because he demanded it. And he commanded it because he would be the first
01:33:34.96 --> 01:33:43.04 guy if it pops off. He's going to be right there. He's not, he's not ducking behind anything. He's
01:33:43.04 --> 01:33:50.48 the dude walking up and down the line smoking a cigar. That's that gunny. He's that guy and it was just
01:33:50.48 --> 01:33:58.24 an abundant amount of respect he had. And even if you, even if you hated him, you loved to hate them.
01:33:58.24 --> 01:34:09.76 You know, but I love the dude because it was for me he was what the Marine Corps met as one individual.
01:34:09.76 --> 01:34:16.88 And I dug that about him. You know, I was like, that's, I need to be around him all the time. I want
01:34:16.88 --> 01:34:23.76 more of what's in his head in mind. I can learn a tremendous amount from this guy. And so I'm
01:34:23.76 --> 01:34:29.12 walking back into the tent. He's in front of the tent. I said, good evening, Gunny. And I walked
01:34:29.12 --> 01:34:34.40 behind him and say, if any grabs like the back of my skibby shirt and pulls me back towards him and
01:34:34.40 --> 01:34:43.44 any hug me, we said, I love you, shit. And I was like, I don't know, dude, my hands. Like, I'm, like, what
01:34:43.44 --> 01:34:50.24 do I do? Do I say it back? Is this a trap? What do I do? And this sounds like screw it, man. I mean,
01:34:50.24 --> 01:34:57.92 I've been dirty before. All of you two guns. I mean, I'll never forget he just looked at me
01:34:57.92 --> 01:35:05.44 and writing my face and just said, you're going to be alright. So I'll do that. So then I was like,
01:35:05.44 --> 01:35:13.28 okay, something's not right. At this point, I'm 100% convinced something's not right. I didn't know
01:35:13.28 --> 01:35:19.84 what it was, but I knew it wasn't right. So I broke my card and I went to the phone tent,
01:35:20.80 --> 01:35:26.08 called my family and the last person I call was my dad. And you know, you have the two,
01:35:26.08 --> 01:35:32.08 three second delay. And I knew it was about 10 30 night in Streetport, Louisiana. And I knew you
01:35:32.08 --> 01:35:37.52 was home alone because my stepmom and my little brother were at the ranch of San Antonio and the answer
01:35:37.52 --> 01:35:42.24 was the phone and I said, hey, pop. And he knew me because I'm the only kid that calls him pop.
01:35:43.28 --> 01:35:50.56 The first words out of his mouth were why am I talking to you. It's almost like he knew that I knew
01:35:51.36 --> 01:35:58.88 something wasn't right. And I said, I just wanted to tell you how much I love you. And what you,
01:35:58.88 --> 01:36:05.20 you being my father means to me as your son. Because at this point in our life,
01:36:05.20 --> 01:36:10.40 in our journey, it's father and son was, that's pretty much where it ended. He was my dad. I was a son.
01:36:11.52 --> 01:36:16.48 That was it. Because my older brother, he was born and God just touched his forehead and said,
01:36:16.48 --> 01:36:21.76 athlete. And my dad was baseball player and my brother's baseball player always hated it. That is
01:36:21.76 --> 01:36:30.40 the slowest sport known to mankind. It's like watching paint dry. And so I always, growing up,
01:36:30.40 --> 01:36:36.16 felt like I was always chasing my brother. I was chasing this this unbelievable athlete that I was
01:36:36.16 --> 01:36:43.04 never going to be better than when it came to athleticism no matter what sport. But I was chasing
01:36:43.04 --> 01:36:48.64 that. And then I was like, okay, well, I'm going to go play baseball, the try and appease my dad to show
01:36:48.64 --> 01:36:52.80 him like, hey, I can do this through. And I sucked. I was never going to run. It was never going to
01:36:52.80 --> 01:37:00.64 get that. You know, football, knowing now baseball is an art almost. It's a calculated art where
01:37:00.64 --> 01:37:11.36 with football, if you can run into another human with 100% focus and 100% will of breaking that man's
01:37:11.36 --> 01:37:19.44 will by making your body collide with his as hard as you can, you can play football. To a certain
01:37:19.44 --> 01:37:26.16 extent, you can play football. Why did I love that? Because for me, it was an outlet of the
01:37:26.16 --> 01:37:32.32 ingrat aggression that I had. It's a kid growing up and the the antithesis of the cookie cutter
01:37:32.32 --> 01:37:39.68 childhood. And so at this point that I'm leaving, you know, my father and I, it was, we weren't where
01:37:39.68 --> 01:37:46.88 I felt like we should be as father and son. You know, this is a conversation that I've had with my
01:37:46.88 --> 01:37:53.92 dad since obviously. And so when I told him, like, I just want you to know, it's important that
01:37:53.92 --> 01:38:01.76 you know how much I love and respect you and how much I owe you for being there when you were
01:38:01.76 --> 01:38:11.84 adult, a shitty hand, and you had us kids on your own. And you leaned in, you leaned in, and you
01:38:11.84 --> 01:38:20.56 boat up, and I owe you till I die, I'll owe you. And I needed you to know that. And so he said,
01:38:20.56 --> 01:38:26.32 how long is this passion? I said nine days. And yeah, he knew not to ask where you're going,
01:38:26.32 --> 01:38:32.48 what are you doing? Because the people that listen to your every phone call would, you're called
01:38:32.48 --> 01:38:38.56 would be over. And he said, I bet I want to hear from you nine days. He said, I better hear from you nine
01:38:38.56 --> 01:38:44.96 days. And I said, you will, pop. I love you man. He just said, I love you too, and ended with
01:38:44.96 --> 01:38:50.64 your better be okay. And I hung up. And it was one of those moments where I was like,
01:38:53.04 --> 01:39:05.44 as a at the time I'm 21 years old, and I realized, I have, I have no control over anything.
01:39:05.44 --> 01:39:13.28 Nothing. I feel like I think I can. I think I have control and
01:39:13.92 --> 01:39:18.96 in protecting my team and making sure my team's okay. I have no control over anything.
01:39:20.24 --> 01:39:27.84 It was one of those human moments where I realized, I'm just as vulnerable as everyone else.
01:39:27.84 --> 01:39:35.12 There's nothing special about me. I can be the biggest, strongest, toughest. It doesn't matter.
01:39:36.88 --> 01:39:42.08 It does not matter. Because when it's your time, it's your time. That's it.
01:39:43.04 --> 01:39:45.36 Doesn't matter what you know, doesn't matter how well-trained you are.
01:39:46.48 --> 01:39:51.28 If God pulls your card, you're done. So it was a very, very
01:39:51.28 --> 01:39:59.68 sobering and humbling moment for me. And we left out the next morning to go to Alice.
01:39:59.68 --> 01:40:04.64 It's our go to do love. We get out to do love, and we start
01:40:06.96 --> 01:40:11.20 patrol on the perimeter, and for Reactors call, of course, me and the React team, which
01:40:11.20 --> 01:40:17.44 me and nine Marines would go to wherever the React is, and but I always had that.
01:40:17.44 --> 01:40:23.84 Have you feeling in my gut that it didn't affect my job, it didn't affect
01:40:23.84 --> 01:40:30.40 our day-to-day operations and what we were doing, but I knew it was something was coming.
01:40:31.12 --> 01:40:37.36 And then one night we had two guys coming, the main gate, and they were in like a white opal.
01:40:38.96 --> 01:40:42.56 Pulled in the main gate and pretty much just laid down on both sides of the car.
01:40:42.56 --> 01:40:49.76 Obviously not in all the behavior. Well these guys were high profile targets that
01:40:51.04 --> 01:40:55.92 once we find out who they are and radio batayan, they're like, don't let them out of your sight.
01:40:57.28 --> 01:41:02.80 And so we ended up having, and for the React team we had two two-door saw-top on Vs.
01:41:03.60 --> 01:41:08.08 That's what we had to operate in, and the guy, we had one guy in the back of one vehicle,
01:41:08.08 --> 01:41:12.80 another guy in the back of the second vehicle and they both had MTMR, he boxed the duct tape on
01:41:12.80 --> 01:41:19.12 their head because we were out of hoods and so it provided that no overcome. And you know how
01:41:19.12 --> 01:41:27.12 them all, they weren't growing anywhere. Well so the I-Racki National Guard also got to be on the
01:41:27.12 --> 01:41:33.36 same net frequencies, radio frequency. So they're hearing all the transmissions next thing
01:41:33.36 --> 01:41:41.76 you know they show up and there's a lot of them and they pull in and circle us. Obviously it's
01:41:41.76 --> 01:41:48.80 show of force and say you know these guys same thing you went through about the ID maker, the
01:41:48.80 --> 01:41:54.64 bomb maker, you know these guys, they're no threat. These guys are good, you need a lot of them go,
01:41:55.04 --> 01:42:00.56 you know. No. And I remember one of the guys it was like the kernel of the Racki National
01:42:00.56 --> 01:42:07.68 Guard and he said we you need the the tur- the interpreters there and I remember him saying something
01:42:07.68 --> 01:42:13.84 along the lines of we need to take a director from a spear officer and we were like a bro.
01:42:13.84 --> 01:42:17.84 I don't know if you've been working with the army or whatever, well we don't give a shit who you are
01:42:18.64 --> 01:42:26.48 because we know that you're probably a bad guy. So no, they're not leaving.
01:42:26.48 --> 01:42:34.16 And that situation got super gnarly super quick and I was thinking of myself like
01:42:36.80 --> 01:42:43.60 I remember telling one of the guys that had a nine to one of the dudes had and I told him if he
01:42:43.60 --> 01:42:51.20 so much of sneezes, push his brains to the side of his head and I could hear that beretta nine
01:42:51.20 --> 01:42:58.40 mill I could hear it rattling because he was it was I'm sure it was from pre-written um
01:42:59.28 --> 01:43:06.80 the Marines you know and I could hear but I could hear the slide rattling against the barrel and I was like
01:43:08.16 --> 01:43:13.84 did that do you shake and hard? But I knew if that dude so much has sneezed.
01:43:13.84 --> 01:43:22.000 I knew it would happen and so we were by the grace of God we had because we were part of
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:28.16 weapons between but weapons company it just got done doing a coordinate knock or whatever they were
01:43:28.16 --> 01:43:34.000 doing and they're listening to this transmission over the net so we're talking with Battalion saying like
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:40.96 hey this is escalating and there's about 65 of them and 10 of us so they were heavily outnumbered
01:43:40.96 --> 01:43:50.40 obviously but we need some serious shit is gonna go down and so weapons company pulls in
01:43:51.28 --> 01:43:55.44 I don't even remember if it's an hour later three hours it seemed like a freaking eternity
01:43:55.92 --> 01:44:03.44 but they pull in and make a circle around the ING good times bro and of course the weapons company are the ones
01:44:03.44 --> 01:44:12.40 with you know the Martin 19's 50 cows 84 we had 84's too but I mean that all all the big you know
01:44:12.40 --> 01:44:19.12 when they pull in you know like okay those guys have big stuff that obviously goes bang a lot
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:26.000 and so these guys pulled in and it was almost in unison the iron the iron can actually guard guys
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.28 dropping their AKs hands in there no me stuff no me stuff you know I was like yep those are our home
01:44:31.28 --> 01:44:36.48 me so you know like so let's and so those guys they take them and take them back to a
01:44:36.48 --> 01:44:44.40 Alicid and you know and they they pop corn far disappear just gone let me I'm sure some
01:44:44.40 --> 01:44:50.48 super secret squirrel age just came in and got them or whatever we finally go to bed down and
01:44:52.24 --> 01:44:58.96 I go up to the command post and dock was up at the command post was just turned to sit in the vehicle
01:44:58.96 --> 01:45:05.28 that that powers the command post and this is turned to count the flares long you free to use and
01:45:06.40 --> 01:45:11.20 when was it shot what color was it and then we turned into Intel and then they tried crack code
01:45:11.20 --> 01:45:18.40 decipher code and so we saw a dock and telling them like you know okay man this was nice I can't
01:45:18.40 --> 01:45:27.04 know that that's crazy and so I can barely keep my eyes open at this point drillins
01:45:27.04 --> 01:45:34.72 worn off and you know series the high high series low low's no gray area that's what being a
01:45:34.72 --> 01:45:42.16 run is and being a warfighter is and so I built a dock I got a bed down smoked let's go bed down
01:45:42.16 --> 01:45:51.28 the words man and so I go and take my boots off and I'm so tired the take my boots off
01:45:51.28 --> 01:45:59.28 alone my cot and I ragged being Iraq especially in O4 not even 20 minutes later I mean my dog
01:45:59.28 --> 01:46:08.32 didn't even start to breathe react and I came Murphy you're dick you know it was like if that's the
01:46:08.32 --> 01:46:16.40 way Murphy works dude not a fan not a fan of of that Murphy and so you know wake up and I'm like
01:46:16.40 --> 01:46:21.44 all right got a wake up team so I rubbed her back and was especially nothing's in her ear
01:46:21.44 --> 01:46:30.48 because that's how we do it and we these got they're all pissed like yeah this is a bunch of bullshit
01:46:31.68 --> 01:46:38.08 like a man's cuz it's the paycheck that's why we do it but what was the call that came in
01:46:38.48 --> 01:46:45.44 what they what was going down it was um I think it was someone in there someone had gotten in the
01:46:45.44 --> 01:46:51.28 A.O. when supposed to be in the A.O. and you know neutralize threat type thing and I just like
01:46:51.28 --> 01:46:59.76 get up and I'm I'm carrying I think I slide my boots on anytime and I walk out of the tent
01:47:01.12 --> 01:47:04.40 soon as I walk out of the tent that feeling I had my gut went right in my throat
01:47:05.60 --> 01:47:10.72 rules right into my throat and I knew we're about to get it I knew
01:47:10.72 --> 01:47:16.64 it sure as I was that the sun was gonna come up I knew we were gonna get it I didn't know how bad
01:47:16.64 --> 01:47:21.76 it was gonna be I didn't know by what I didn't know to the extent but I knew it was gonna happen
01:47:23.12 --> 01:47:31.60 and so I by the I took measures and did things that otherwise wouldn't have done and you
01:47:31.60 --> 01:47:36.08 mean caught my grandfather talked to me from beyond the grave you can call a god and call whatever you want
01:47:36.08 --> 01:47:40.96 good news is that I can have my beliefs and you can have yours and odds are we're not gonna
01:47:40.96 --> 01:47:47.28 get our heads cut off because we live in a free society and so I my commanding officer was out there
01:47:49.60 --> 01:47:55.68 to do a report on what it went down the night before he was sleeping and but I knew he had a bomb
01:47:55.68 --> 01:48:01.12 blanket and so I took the bomb blanket out of the pasture seat of the one of the only up on
01:48:01.12 --> 01:48:07.28 where it on me's we had at the time and I went to the lead vehicle and I told the driver
01:48:07.28 --> 01:48:12.32 scoot over the lead vehicles to this day of a great friend of mine put the bomb blanket down
01:48:12.32 --> 01:48:16.64 and I told the guys button up if they gave it to us for protection but put it on now
01:48:17.84 --> 01:48:23.12 which I usually wasn't a little hardcore about just because when it's 120 something that
01:48:23.12 --> 01:48:29.44 agrees and you you have all that gear on more gear is not optimal to the whole being comfortable
01:48:29.44 --> 01:48:37.28 thing and I'm sure the guys knew something was up and then I take the radio from the arrow
01:48:38.56 --> 01:48:47.52 and everything's buttoned up a black jacket couple or wiley access for shattered proof
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:57.20 that they should have said kind of shattered proof and then it's the growing protector
01:48:57.20 --> 01:49:03.04 they gave it we had it on and so I get on the horn with my right arm driving on my left
01:49:04.24 --> 01:49:13.52 I gasped it and see you're driving I'm driving driving and just because I had you put the
01:49:13.52 --> 01:49:20.88 bomb blanket under the under the driver seat and so I don't know it was just reaction I mean
01:49:20.88 --> 01:49:25.92 something was guiding me to do all these things you know I'm not I can't tell you what the
01:49:25.92 --> 01:49:31.36 lot of numbers are like I can't tell I don't have BSP I guess me I'm not a fortune teller
01:49:31.36 --> 01:49:35.84 like something was guiding me to do these things and you just put that bomb blanket under
01:49:35.84 --> 01:49:40.80 their just because you just could something told me put it in the driver seat and get in the
01:49:40.80 --> 01:49:47.44 driver seat take the radio I did all these things I punched it three minutes later we had a triple
01:49:47.44 --> 01:49:55.92 stack press replading nighted so three three one five five Mike Mike and Laman's turn with that
01:49:55.92 --> 01:50:02.72 means is the big ass bomb yeah that's about 175 pounds of explosives it's a lot it's freaking big
01:50:02.72 --> 01:50:08.88 blew up directly beneath me blew me about 30 feet at top of the home v stuck the landing with my
01:50:08.88 --> 01:50:15.52 head because again Marines blew even good forms and I like to say because God's a comedian I
01:50:15.52 --> 01:50:19.20 never lost consciousness on everyone into shock I remember the whole thing took the black
01:50:19.20 --> 01:50:25.52 clock 42 minutes come get me so I love to look at people when they're like such a long day
01:50:25.52 --> 01:50:34.80 it worked my really hold on let me throw some perspective your way but that's only when I'm in a bad mood
01:50:35.36 --> 01:50:45.04 but it was I knew mid-air it was bad I knew it was bad I knew this was not good at all
01:50:45.04 --> 01:50:53.36 and when I hit the deck I couldn't breathe because the as you know the series of events on
01:50:53.36 --> 01:50:59.12 explosion a million things happen in a nanosecond especially when it's that big of an explosion
01:50:59.12 --> 01:51:05.36 and so it was when the dashboard disengaged and steer will hit me my chest it made exploded all my
01:51:05.36 --> 01:51:13.12 mags hit me my chest and temporary collapsed both my lungs before I was blown out and whole
01:51:13.12 --> 01:51:21.12 series of things happened before during this process causing injuries and I hit the deck and
01:51:22.72 --> 01:51:28.40 I knew I'm hurt bad I can't breathe can't hear anything it's just ringing and
01:51:30.16 --> 01:51:35.28 first thing I do is talk to God first thing I did before I even did self assessment
01:51:35.28 --> 01:51:41.36 this is talk to guys I can't see out of my right eye thanks to this shattered proof well yeah
01:51:43.36 --> 01:51:50.24 because they shattered both of them all yeah there's there's something called a triple stacked
01:51:50.24 --> 01:51:54.64 idea I don't know what glasses are gonna hang with that one saying hey listen man false
01:51:54.64 --> 01:52:02.000 advertising right yeah so we got it but we um I'm there a great company I'm just you know
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:08.56 gonna find light in every situation but we but I talked to God right away this is exactly what I said
01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:16.48 hey big man I know this is bad all I'm asking is that you don't take me in front of my family
01:52:17.92 --> 01:52:20.96 it's all I'm asking don't let my brothers watch me die
01:52:22.24 --> 01:52:26.88 soon as this kids leave the deck come all yours just please don't let my brothers watch me die
01:52:26.88 --> 01:52:34.24 talk here about and I started the self assessment which starts with checking your junk
01:52:35.20 --> 01:52:38.48 the only thing that worked was my right arm everything else shattered or broken
01:52:39.76 --> 01:52:46.08 gonna find out all my ribs are broken so I didn't open anything and so I go
01:52:47.76 --> 01:52:54.48 move my growing flap and check my junk and I was like okay that's there everything else has been
01:52:54.48 --> 01:53:03.28 dataable like we're to work through we will survive and but then I looked at my my right
01:53:03.28 --> 01:53:09.04 leg look normal but my right but my right foot and ankle hurt really bad
01:53:10.08 --> 01:53:14.64 this is like a good broad broken well I didn't know it was crushed was the firewall
01:53:14.64 --> 01:53:20.72 and I'm gonna be folded up trust my right foot before I was blown out my left I looked at my left arm
01:53:20.72 --> 01:53:26.80 and I remember seeing like daylight through my left arm part of my left hand was hanging down
01:53:26.80 --> 01:53:34.000 by my elbow it's all like okay that's might not might not keep the left arm
01:53:35.04 --> 01:53:41.76 and I looked down at my left leg which was turned outward like if you're sitting down with both
01:53:41.76 --> 01:53:46.72 legs like you're gonna touch your toes my left leg was turned outward to the left and my foot
01:53:46.72 --> 01:53:54.08 was inverted like with my toes pointing at me and my boot was blown off but my but everything was
01:53:54.08 --> 01:53:59.84 there it was all over the place but it was there so I saw my fibi and my tibia saw all the damage
01:53:59.84 --> 01:54:05.76 that was done to my left leg and because my my canmies were shredded and I thought two things
01:54:05.76 --> 01:54:10.56 when I saw that first thing I thought was that's not supposed to be like that second thing I
01:54:10.56 --> 01:54:17.52 thought was that that was confirmation that that was a very big explosion to be able to blow
01:54:17.52 --> 01:54:23.52 a lace-up combat boot off your leg and not take your leg with it is a massive explosion it's crazy
01:54:24.88 --> 01:54:30.88 and so at this point I'm thinking how was the yeah guy in the guy in the blast blown
01:54:30.88 --> 01:54:37.76 your drums was the other worst injury yeah man so literally blew up straight up directly beneath
01:54:37.76 --> 01:54:42.72 the straight and straight up they must have buried a little bit enough that it just projected
01:54:42.72 --> 01:54:47.36 right up into you yeah and it was so that standoff we had the night before
01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:56.96 it's when they buried it so all that was was a diversion is everyone was glued to the
01:54:56.96 --> 01:55:07.76 radio so it was in a perfect spot it was the one spot around that entire area of operation
01:55:07.76 --> 01:55:15.84 that you couldn't have eyes directly on the one spot yeah and so at this point the guys finally
01:55:15.84 --> 01:55:25.68 make it up to me and there really there's a lot of freaking out because I mean I did the humv move
01:55:25.68 --> 01:55:31.84 oh yeah it was blown so did it get blown up yeah but it was I'll tell you this if we were in an
01:55:31.84 --> 01:55:36.64 upper humv everyone was would be dead from over pressure absolutely there'd been no
01:55:36.64 --> 01:55:45.12 or four to go everyone would have died it would have been but it was blown up and over to the right
01:55:46.32 --> 01:55:53.36 and second view of what affected but the guys are not too mean
01:55:53.36 --> 01:56:02.40 at this point I'm back to telling God like a man just remember our deal
01:56:02.40 --> 01:56:10.08 remember our deal and the guys are okay shit we got your bro we got you you know
01:56:11.12 --> 01:56:17.44 we got you hanged tough and how to know where I was able to take a breath and the first thing
01:56:17.44 --> 01:56:25.60 I said was developed 360 there like oh shit yeah it's like yeah no shit what's coming next yeah
01:56:25.60 --> 01:56:31.84 how do we know we're not so about start taking fire which probably was was unlikely because there
01:56:31.84 --> 01:56:36.40 was no cover in that I mean there had been no where formed a hide and it would have been a
01:56:36.40 --> 01:56:43.36 suicide mission on their part because we had one still very functional 240 and we knew how to
01:56:43.36 --> 01:56:49.28 employ that weapon but they get me back on the second vehicle which was like I said
01:56:49.28 --> 01:56:57.28 still operational and getting me back up to the command post and man and little did I know that
01:56:57.28 --> 01:57:05.36 that's that at that moment that's one my battle my personal war started right then that day
01:57:05.36 --> 01:57:13.12 and I get up there and doc same doc that I was talking to that was in the the on via
01:57:13.84 --> 01:57:24.08 countenaflars it was working on me and I was I was I was pissed I was not happy
01:57:24.56 --> 01:57:31.12 and I was yelling at doc and I was like doc you got to hit me you got to hit me and he's like I already
01:57:31.12 --> 01:57:38.48 did and so I'm like you I was like you're you're a stingy bastard because he only was hit me with
01:57:38.48 --> 01:57:42.48 two sticks of morphine and I knew he had more and all I knew was I was in a lot of pain he had the
01:57:42.48 --> 01:57:47.84 remedy and he wasn't given to me and I was like that's that's kind of bullshit you know I did
01:57:47.84 --> 01:57:53.44 understand that the muscles around my lungs could relax so much I self-cate I didn't know
01:57:53.44 --> 01:57:58.72 didn't care just knew I was in a lot of pain he had drugs and he was not giving him to me
01:57:58.72 --> 01:58:08.80 little that I know the guy was the the tip of the spirits saving my life and um while this whole
01:58:08.80 --> 01:58:17.28 situation was really gnarly and very painful and very very humbling I wouldn't traded it all because
01:58:17.28 --> 01:58:23.44 I got to tell everyone of those guys every single one of them I'm saying this is just like talking
01:58:23.44 --> 01:58:28.72 to my dad but I was talking to my brothers just got to tell everyone of them how much I love them how much
01:58:28.72 --> 01:58:34.16 they meant to me how much I respected them and that this is real what we're doing is real look at me
01:58:35.12 --> 01:58:41.20 look at me and remember this and go fight your balls off because this is what they want to do to
01:58:41.20 --> 01:58:50.88 everyone of us don't let it happen again just just just learn from this you have to fight for me now
01:58:50.88 --> 01:59:02.72 and that was you know it was a situation where they kept telling me you know he shook his
01:59:02.72 --> 01:59:09.20 your bird home your bird home and it would piss me off every time they said it it was like I don't want
01:59:09.20 --> 01:59:15.12 to go home shut up I don't want to go home shake you get to go see your family you are my family
01:59:15.12 --> 01:59:22.72 I'll see them when it's time to see them you know it was that so there's this whole series of thoughts
01:59:23.44 --> 01:59:30.000 and emotions and you know I mean it was everything from laughing and crying everything in between
01:59:30.48 --> 01:59:37.36 laughing again and they were scrambling to get the the metavac there and the problem was that we
01:59:37.36 --> 01:59:42.88 didn't have any fighter escort and let's took forever because they were all dispatched so for
01:59:42.88 --> 01:59:50.32 I mean they were all scrambled and so those finally it was a Texas Army National Guard pilot
01:59:50.88 --> 01:59:56.16 that heard the transmission that you know this marine out of Texas category four rapidly
01:59:56.16 --> 02:00:00.88 approaching category five. Scatigory four's urgent surgery category five being an
02:00:00.88 --> 02:00:11.36 expectant and he finally got a screw and said I strew the rules for going to get this marine and he
02:00:11.36 --> 02:00:19.60 came and got me and I remember the guys were loading me on the black hog and my
02:00:19.60 --> 02:00:29.92 two sergeant was the last one on and man that was that was a that was an emotional experience dude because it was
02:00:31.92 --> 02:00:37.52 anyway two sergeant son and he kisses me on my forehead and he says we'll see soon jacklandin
02:00:38.16 --> 02:00:42.56 he's always called me jacklandin because my first generation marine is jacklandin shex second generation
02:00:42.56 --> 02:00:46.80 jacklandin chick junior so he always called me jacklandin because I guess Jake wasn't good enough
02:00:46.80 --> 02:00:52.40 but he but when he said it he was trying not to cry and I could tell in his eyes he was lying
02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:01.60 which kind of motivated me and I was like well I'll show you I'm gonna prove you wrong and you are
02:01:01.60 --> 02:01:10.40 gonna see me again even though it wasn't my choice right and so the the bird takes off man and
02:01:10.40 --> 02:01:22.88 um out of everything I've been through from day one to now that was the hardest moment hands
02:01:22.88 --> 02:01:31.44 down no questions asked was leaving those guys hands down that was the hardest moment because that's when
02:01:31.44 --> 02:01:44.000 I was taught just how human I am and just how irrelevant I am and it was a very very hard
02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:50.40 experience to leave my family in harm's way and there wasn't a damn thing I could do about it
02:01:51.60 --> 02:01:59.52 you talk about being humbled that will humble you and we get up in the in the air and I'm
02:01:59.52 --> 02:02:06.40 able I'm able to get the attention I want to litter crews a young dude I mean again I'm 21 he's
02:02:06.40 --> 02:02:13.60 probably 18 19 but mill through years that's Eons and he comes up and he gets right he puts his left
02:02:13.60 --> 02:02:18.64 you right in front of my face and I yelled as a lot of as I could because as you know on the back
02:02:18.64 --> 02:02:22.72 one of the birds you know I've had said on the canter shoes and I yelled as far as I could
02:02:22.72 --> 02:02:27.12 how long and I remember when I did I felt life leave my body I knew I was dying
02:02:27.12 --> 02:02:33.36 did they turn it get you already the doctor yeah over and over yeah because I mean I was bleeding everywhere
02:02:33.36 --> 02:02:40.40 yeah so do you have did you have strappin wounds yeah so it was not just your leg and you
02:02:40.40 --> 02:02:46.08 were not strappin I had a trap on my my chin side of my face my my neck
02:02:47.68 --> 02:02:56.40 right arm left arm left leg it was it was bad and um I had not had that sappy pleading my
02:02:56.40 --> 02:03:01.92 flat I had been dead there was a big a piece there's a piece sticking out that was bigger than
02:03:01.92 --> 02:03:09.20 this cable or sticking out right out of the center and my gunny took pictures of my gear showing guys
02:03:09.20 --> 02:03:19.28 like hey no matter how uncomfortable you are this is why you don't cut corners yeah and um but this
02:03:19.28 --> 02:03:23.68 dude on the litter crew radios up front of the captain he comes back and he yells in my right
02:03:23.68 --> 02:03:32.24 here 12 mics there's a lot of you can 12 minutes and so I was I immediately talked to God again
02:03:32.24 --> 02:03:38.56 right away my a big man I'm gonna have to re-nig on that original verbal agreement
02:03:38.56 --> 02:03:46.96 I'm pretty sure I can do 12 more minutes and um the obviously he gave me that because I'm
02:03:46.96 --> 02:03:53.92 talking to but um we go home we landed in blood which is just to make shit filled hospital at the
02:03:53.92 --> 02:03:58.72 time I'm sure you remember from seeing the no four but it was and they pulled me off the bird
02:03:58.72 --> 02:04:06.56 and immediately immediately started working on me I mean it was I would not happy about the situation
02:04:06.56 --> 02:04:11.92 because they kept saying name rank social name rank social name rank social is it wanted me alert
02:04:11.92 --> 02:04:17.12 there where you know and I knew what they were doing and I was like but it's like if you slam
02:04:17.12 --> 02:04:22.64 your finger in the door right and your body is right there and he's like hey are you okay are you okay
02:04:22.64 --> 02:04:28.80 are you okay are you okay and every time they say it the pain goes up like I would be golden
02:04:28.80 --> 02:04:34.000 if you would you shut your yapper you know and so I just yelled finally and pointed with my
02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:40.000 right arm who's only it works that hey statuid right to all my ribs I'm done talking
02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:48.24 like I'm gonna show them right and I didn't inside and talking to the get me in the tent and
02:04:50.16 --> 02:04:55.20 they they loaded me up with some of the good shit because I felt it definitely helped the pain
02:04:55.20 --> 02:04:59.04 but I was still a massive amount of pain and I'll never forget one of the surgery was slowing
02:04:59.04 --> 02:05:05.04 up my face and he said oops yeah I looked at I was like what do you mean oops doc I mean it's like
02:05:05.04 --> 02:05:10.24 a K-SARM arena picked up on your stitches gonna start again and I said hey doc at this point I have
02:05:10.24 --> 02:05:16.48 the sheet up to my neck I said hey doc I don't know if you've seen seen my body from the neck down
02:05:17.12 --> 02:05:22.16 but I'm fairly certain the scratches on my face are the least of our worries and I think you had
02:05:22.16 --> 02:05:27.84 the the anesthetist not me out of that moment because I don't that's the last thing I remember
02:05:28.40 --> 02:05:33.20 until I was working up by nurse jacks who she had told me
02:05:33.20 --> 02:05:40.000 she will be up and you know I'm coming out of the OR and um that's still in the lot yeah and she
02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:46.32 says hey marine I'm sorry to tell you this we had to take your right foot it was dead when you
02:05:46.32 --> 02:05:52.72 got here there's no blood flow and it was crushed and I remember thinking to myself like
02:05:53.52 --> 02:05:58.72 shit they took the wrong foot because it was my left one that was really messed up and so then I
02:05:58.72 --> 02:06:05.52 think like you know like it's good enough for government work whatever and I'm just it's
02:06:05.52 --> 02:06:09.68 blood it's I'm just like you know in a long day just got wrong so you're completely
02:06:09.68 --> 02:06:16.88 contorted and twisted in backwards and left foot it was was the one that made it and then
02:06:16.88 --> 02:06:22.24 what that looked pretty normal to you look completely normal with my boot on look everything
02:06:22.24 --> 02:06:28.88 normal but then she described it to me she she said when we when you got here imagine
02:06:30.16 --> 02:06:34.32 like a surgical glove but in the shape of a foot as opposed to a hand
02:06:35.12 --> 02:06:41.76 being filled with sand that was your right foot she said everything it was everything and it was
02:06:41.76 --> 02:06:47.76 completely crushed there was it was to the point to where there was it cut off the blood supply
02:06:47.76 --> 02:06:56.000 and so somehow none of my major arteries and my left arm or left leg I hit and so there was still
02:06:57.36 --> 02:07:06.32 hope for my left leg and my left arm but she ended up we ended up loading up on the bird to go to
02:07:06.32 --> 02:07:13.60 Germany and she flew with me to Germany because I was I was not out of the woods by any stretch
02:07:13.60 --> 02:07:19.44 it was gonna be a this was gonna be a long and arduous recovery process and I remember getting to
02:07:20.48 --> 02:07:28.88 Germany I don't know I'm sorry but before we left this was four days after I talked to my
02:07:28.88 --> 02:07:37.20 my dad so I called my dad from the sat phone they giving me my dad entered the phone and
02:07:37.20 --> 02:07:46.56 said hey pop and he said why am I talking to you I said they got me so what do you mean they got
02:07:46.56 --> 02:07:52.08 me so they got me dad in the murder said how bad are you hurt so they had take my right foot
02:07:53.28 --> 02:07:59.28 there's a pause and then he said are you gonna make it and I said I don't know
02:08:01.12 --> 02:08:05.52 he said we're waiting for a certain green and you know we'll meet you in Germany
02:08:05.52 --> 02:08:13.92 and at this point man I'm not four-year-old kid again just needed that and I
02:08:15.28 --> 02:08:18.96 last thing I told him was I was I love them but right then I said please hurry
02:08:20.64 --> 02:08:27.04 and he said you're right I love you and love you too that was the hardest one I've ever made in my life
02:08:27.04 --> 02:08:34.96 because I just see him at my actual graduation saying why would you do that and I'm like damn it
02:08:36.56 --> 02:08:42.88 you know damn it you may have had something there like and I'm still thinking like a young
02:08:42.88 --> 02:08:48.80 image your kid but I knew one thing I wanted my dad and so I get to Germany and
02:08:51.60 --> 02:08:55.68 one of my best friends from high school was a little brother who was like my little brother
02:08:55.68 --> 02:09:02.56 growing up was an army and he was a scout and he was there in Germany and was able to get
02:09:02.56 --> 02:09:07.76 word that I was on my way and he was right there and they had been on storage open
02:09:09.28 --> 02:09:14.96 and he put his head on my chest and he lost it it started falling and I just remember
02:09:14.96 --> 02:09:22.08 I'm telling him sorry Josh it's all right man and you know you just kept saying not you not you
02:09:22.08 --> 02:09:28.64 and he wouldn't leave my side you know but he had a cell phone and I got to call other people
02:09:28.64 --> 02:09:34.16 and even there trying to take me to the OR to watch me out and reset my left leg left arm
02:09:34.16 --> 02:09:40.56 and redo the external fixators he was like he's walking right next to the bed like he's
02:09:40.56 --> 02:09:44.96 going into the OR with me and I remember them saying like so you can't kind of he was like the
02:09:44.96 --> 02:09:50.000 hell I can't what do you and I was like you can't do like just come on man they don't have
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:56.40 no drugs for both of us so that's but he was it was just a ghost to show you man like it's there
02:09:56.40 --> 02:10:03.44 were so many experiences throughout this process that just reassured me of how very real
02:10:04.64 --> 02:10:11.84 that something bigger than us out there is you know that there I was a believer growing up man
02:10:11.84 --> 02:10:17.52 but this was there were things that happened that no one could explain that had to be
02:10:17.52 --> 02:10:24.64 from our power and that was just one of them one of those moments where I was that was a
02:10:24.64 --> 02:10:30.88 part of me living was Josh being there and me not having to be alone in that situation
02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:37.04 so I ended up leaving Germany and I was only there for you know what even there a full day
02:10:37.04 --> 02:10:44.16 before they send me to Bethesda and I I lent because my family was supposed to meet me a
02:10:44.16 --> 02:10:49.92 Germany but the turnaround was so fast that you know the Marines right now we're just gonna send you
02:10:49.92 --> 02:10:57.68 Bethesda and I got to Bethesda and man those flights both flights from my rack of Jeremy
02:10:57.68 --> 02:11:05.52 Germany to Bethesda every little like bit of turbulence every little bump every little movement was
02:11:05.52 --> 02:11:11.68 like being blown up all over again it was narlie because your your body was under it was in so much
02:11:11.68 --> 02:11:19.52 pain it was just I'd never puked so much because of pain in my life and it was one of those
02:11:19.52 --> 02:11:26.40 things where I was again every little jar every movement was just like yours human is the
02:11:26.40 --> 02:11:34.16 gum like there's nothing special about yeah this is not gonna get easier and I remember the
02:11:34.16 --> 02:11:40.88 getting there and they're waiting over by the inertia entrance and the doors open and of course
02:11:40.88 --> 02:11:45.84 the little yays on it told my family like a jakes on the runway just touched down and my dad
02:11:46.56 --> 02:11:52.88 is there and I'm sure I looked amazing my head was probably size of a watermelon and I was black
02:11:52.88 --> 02:11:58.88 and blue and purple and then I'm sure I smelled amazing too and my dad put his hand on my chest
02:11:58.88 --> 02:12:03.76 and he said Bubba is at you and all I could get out was get your damn hand off my chest because
02:12:03.76 --> 02:12:08.08 all my ribs were broken and it hurt like a wall and he looks at my family because he had
02:12:08.08 --> 02:12:13.52 up that's jake it's jake so they load their they're rolling me on the gurney and this young
02:12:13.52 --> 02:12:20.64 sailors pushing me and I remember every little like in the grout that separates tiles like every
02:12:20.64 --> 02:12:25.92 little bump it was like getting blown up again and it would just make it would take my
02:12:25.92 --> 02:12:34.24 pan from six to as much as you could think snap of a family and it was gnarly and so I remember
02:12:34.24 --> 02:12:40.96 he's going to push me on the elevator to take me down at ICU and you know the big gap
02:12:40.96 --> 02:12:46.72 the separates the floor and the elevator we goes across that and we're in the big elevator where
02:12:46.72 --> 02:12:50.88 they take the gurney to take the patients on gurney and so my family's in there with us and
02:12:50.88 --> 02:13:01.12 he goes across that bump and this dude is so young and just he was the epitome of a boot
02:13:01.12 --> 02:13:08.16 and so it goes across that gap and I knife hand him with my right hand and I look up and I say
02:13:08.16 --> 02:13:14.48 if you do that again I'm gonna take you out in my dad last and looks at the family like he's
02:13:14.48 --> 02:13:22.64 gonna be okay you know and like the dudes meaning to hit gaps right it's just you know the
02:13:22.64 --> 02:13:26.80 problem was as I was never trained to be a severely wounded marine it wasn't in the handbook
02:13:26.80 --> 02:13:33.68 and so I didn't know what the hell to do and let's just get this out of the way I was never a good
02:13:33.68 --> 02:13:44.08 patient ever not one time it was something that I just didn't have in me all I knew to do was to be a
02:13:44.08 --> 02:13:51.52 dick and fight like hell and when I fight like hell it's I'm usually a dick that was my survival
02:13:51.52 --> 02:13:57.12 man that was you just like angry were you angry you were hurt and pissed off that you were you're
02:13:57.12 --> 02:14:04.56 like was gone and you're like just pissed and so every nurses you're pissed at I'm not mad
02:14:04.56 --> 02:14:09.04 listen I'm not angry that my legs gone I'm not angry I'm angry I'm talking about at that time
02:14:09.04 --> 02:14:14.24 at that time I'm not angry that my legs gone I'm not angry I never did the Y me I never
02:14:14.24 --> 02:14:20.000 not want to this day not don't have I don't believe in that I'm angry because my family
02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:27.84 is back in a god forsaken land fighting and there and here I am sucking up oxygen in a hospital
02:14:27.84 --> 02:14:36.88 but that's why I'm angry I'm pissed off at god it's like hey you had a perfectly good chance
02:14:37.76 --> 02:14:46.48 perfectly good chance then you what the hell you know what the hell that's I mean what am I supposed
02:14:46.48 --> 02:14:54.72 to do right from here right now what am I doing I'm doing no good none that's why I was angry
02:14:55.68 --> 02:15:02.16 and I was angry because I could not contribute to what I was trained to contribute to with
02:15:02.88 --> 02:15:09.44 with my brothers like that's they were there and I was back home an air condition room with
02:15:09.44 --> 02:15:16.16 a bunch of people waiting on me hand and foot upon totally intended like that you know that's why I was pissed
02:15:17.60 --> 02:15:23.84 no they couldn't understand that yeah and I and I don't blame them for that to this day I don't blame
02:15:23.84 --> 02:15:30.32 them for that but it was you know for we had a lot of guys getting hurt a lot of guys getting wounded
02:15:30.32 --> 02:15:38.80 and I mean the hospital was full of guys I wasn't a different I wasn't special I wasn't any better
02:15:38.80 --> 02:15:45.36 or worse or I was just a guy that had a bad day at work so what are they doing what are you going
02:15:45.36 --> 02:15:51.20 through at this point you know obviously you're going through surgery I mean surgery it was
02:15:51.20 --> 02:15:58.72 Narlie yeah I mean it was every for the first two and a half I guess months I was home I was in the
02:15:58.72 --> 02:16:05.76 OR every 48 72 hours and some of those operations were like 18 19 20 hour operations and they're
02:16:05.76 --> 02:16:10.40 piecing you back together yeah man Robert for Peter give the Paul to try and save my left leg
02:16:10.40 --> 02:16:15.60 in my left arms and do that and stuff it was crazy crazy crazy how many surgeries you have
02:16:16.08 --> 02:16:22.64 state side at 46 and I had 23 blood transfusions I've had a couple surgeries had a neck surgery
02:16:23.52 --> 02:16:29.84 and I had a hernia surgery so when you get when I got those surgeries right like you just feel
02:16:29.84 --> 02:16:35.60 like complete crap it's so you're just going through that every just like almost on a permanent level
02:16:35.60 --> 02:16:45.76 yeah the anesthesia the blood loss all that stuff it just it's wake up suck go to bed repeat
02:16:46.72 --> 02:16:56.48 it was nothing there's nothing fun about any of it and I mean it was so bad that
02:16:58.40 --> 02:17:02.96 it was like the nurses at the nurse they should have the night nurses I'll never forget and it happened
02:17:02.96 --> 02:17:08.88 every night they would do paper rocks this is just you had to take my chart
02:17:11.12 --> 02:17:18.80 it was that bad and I got for a bit of psychologist walkin my god for a bit
02:17:19.68 --> 02:17:25.44 it was because I was adding nothing to say to those so I'm kind of I just realized I laughed at this
02:17:25.44 --> 02:17:31.28 right and we're in your telling it in a funny way because you're like hey I was a bad patient
02:17:31.28 --> 02:17:36.48 but at the point I was getting that before like why you were angry but you like we're laughing
02:17:36.48 --> 02:17:42.24 about it right now but you're not kidding like this like you were p***ing pissed right yeah
02:17:42.24 --> 02:17:45.84 and when someone come in you'd be like you don't get that off me I don't know if you don't
02:17:45.84 --> 02:17:52.32 what you got like just aggro with people so I had this this is the rule that I had as a patient
02:17:53.36 --> 02:17:59.28 you're not allowed in my room unless we share DNA or your United States Marine
02:17:59.28 --> 02:18:05.52 and that goes for the president on down I don't give a shit what your title is or who you are
02:18:05.52 --> 02:18:10.24 those are the rules if you don't have the same DNA as me and your United States Marine don't
02:18:10.24 --> 02:18:15.92 come in my room because I'm gonna let you know you're not allowed and that was because I'm
02:18:15.92 --> 02:18:21.76 in survival mode and survival mode I didn't know what that looked like while I was making it up as
02:18:21.76 --> 02:18:27.60 I got as I went and I mean it was didn't matter what surgeon was talking to me what professional
02:18:27.60 --> 02:18:33.52 with a bunch of letters after his or her name I didn't care I did not care because my mind
02:18:33.52 --> 02:18:42.48 said was like I'm trying to figure out how to get to the next breath in the least painful ways
02:18:42.48 --> 02:18:51.76 possible and it was something that it was like I said I went from being one of the most
02:18:51.76 --> 02:18:56.80 part of one of the most elite fighting forces known to mankind to not being able to use
02:18:56.80 --> 02:19:03.68 the bathroom on my own now is in a hospital bed for months overnight I mean it the drop of a hat
02:19:04.96 --> 02:19:09.92 that's not homo pie that's in hell in the factory knowing that my guys I knew
02:19:09.92 --> 02:19:16.96 Felusio we were already drawing the war plan for Felusio and so it's like here I am
02:19:19.44 --> 02:19:24.000 and not broken I hate that terminology but here I am completely fractured
02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:34.56 and these guys are hooking in jab and they're asking me what kind of what color Jello I want
02:19:36.72 --> 02:19:43.84 and it's like I don't need I don't need to eat I need to get through the next minute
02:19:45.44 --> 02:19:52.56 and then the minute after that I get nothing else matters nothing I just need to survive
02:19:52.56 --> 02:20:01.68 second by second minute my minute breath by breath and continue to believe I'm worth this thing
02:20:01.68 --> 02:20:08.48 called life I need to keep fighting and a byproduct of that is that I was a giant dick
02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:16.72 but I kept fighting it wasn't pretty but I kept fighting and how long were you in Bethesda
02:20:16.72 --> 02:20:25.52 four so I'm only Bethesda a few months and then they moved me not in fact my my dad goes to
02:20:25.52 --> 02:20:34.80 Walter Reed and then he comes back and he says yo Jake this is your deal and let me back up a bit
02:20:35.52 --> 02:20:40.32 my dad and my brother are both pretty squeamish like when it comes to blood and stuff like that
02:20:40.32 --> 02:20:47.52 I just don't do well with it my dad who was an executive manager, just retired last year an executive
02:20:47.52 --> 02:20:56.16 banker started as a window teller to bang it worked his way up did not leave my bedside for 62 days
02:20:58.72 --> 02:21:05.84 didn't leave my side no matter how hard I was on him or did they did not leave my side
02:21:05.84 --> 02:21:12.64 and I like to say that if I had it not been for this explosion I would not be nearly as close to my
02:21:12.64 --> 02:21:18.48 you can't I don't think I could possibly be closer to my dad as I am now or my brother
02:21:19.28 --> 02:21:27.20 same thing same relationship that before just didn't we just didn't have it and I think it was
02:21:27.20 --> 02:21:32.48 because there was always that office struggle where is it had to take one of the office
02:21:32.48 --> 02:21:39.28 having a thumb over the grim reaper for everyone to say what the hell are we doing
02:21:40.88 --> 02:21:47.04 and why are we doing it and that's why I just wanted the reasons I wouldn't trade it
02:21:48.24 --> 02:21:52.48 because that that's beautiful man and I got to experience something that a lot of people don't
02:21:52.48 --> 02:21:58.40 get to experience that they die wondering that I said everything I needed to say
02:21:58.40 --> 02:22:04.000 that I love as hard as I needed to love I don't have to wonder about that now
02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:08.24 I needed to the loving beloved everything else is filler
02:22:10.48 --> 02:22:16.88 so that's why I would not trade it but I remember my dad taught me with my left arm one night they
02:22:17.92 --> 02:22:21.52 they were telling me okay Jake you know we have this we have to re-construct your left arm and
02:22:22.32 --> 02:22:27.76 the bottom graph took the first time but the top graph didn't take and the second time they tried
02:22:27.76 --> 02:22:34.08 doing it I remember they I woke up all they were cutting the graphed off and that was an
02:22:34.08 --> 02:22:38.80 early experience but I was a week for like literally 0.5 seconds before they knocked me back out
02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:45.84 and did you hit anybody in that 0.5 seconds I tried to hit people all the time I think it was
02:22:45.84 --> 02:22:51.60 stupid I mean I messed up stitches and staples and stuff all the time and I took up my
02:22:51.60 --> 02:22:59.60 own out all the time I broke up drugged up for you during this time dude I was on enough drugs to
02:22:59.60 --> 02:23:04.80 like kill a herd of elephants because everybody's body reacts differently to drugs right
02:23:04.80 --> 02:23:09.28 either you they accept them and you didn't take a lot with mine fights everything
02:23:10.40 --> 02:23:17.20 you know I mean which is not surprising but it takes if it takes you or you one pill it's going to take me
02:23:17.20 --> 02:23:24.08 five and so every operation I had because these were major these were intrusive operations these
02:23:24.08 --> 02:23:32.40 weren't okay we're gonna go and take the staples out of the no these were we're going in
02:23:32.40 --> 02:23:37.60 cutting you back up and we're gonna power wash this part of your body out and that mean they were
02:23:37.60 --> 02:23:42.64 intrusive operations we're gonna go and take skin from this part of your body and put it on this
02:23:42.64 --> 02:23:47.60 other part of your body and so or we're gonna take this bone out here and we're gonna try and
02:23:47.60 --> 02:23:55.76 graft it over there and so it was one of those things where I knew like okay these are some
02:23:55.76 --> 02:24:01.52 serious things where for six months to a year like I didn't know if I was gonna keep my left
02:24:01.52 --> 02:24:06.24 leg on my left arm because they they were I was going through all these operations to save these
02:24:06.24 --> 02:24:12.96 two appendages that were and for all its purposes I was a guinea pig for a lot of stuff which I'm
02:24:12.96 --> 02:24:18.64 okay with was better me than my brothers I'm alright with that small price to pay would be one of
02:24:18.64 --> 02:24:27.60 the world's finest right and so they I remember the night before I had this major operation on my
02:24:27.60 --> 02:24:34.32 left arm and this was when the graft didn't take the second one and they were doing a bone graft
02:24:34.32 --> 02:24:39.36 and they ampute it in my right leg again to take some of the tibia from my right leg to try and
02:24:39.36 --> 02:24:46.000 graft it in my left arm because five inches of my old on my left arm was bone out and my
02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:52.24 dad asked the doc on there for get it he said hey doc how did you sleep the next morning
02:24:52.24 --> 02:24:58.24 and he said I didn't my dad's a lot one in sleep so it's because I did Jake's operation
02:24:58.24 --> 02:25:05.36 about a thousand times in my head my dad was like okay I think I'm okay with that and then
02:25:07.20 --> 02:25:13.44 I remember masking me a a chick do you you mind if we ampute your fourth digit on your left
02:25:13.44 --> 02:25:17.84 hand because I don't think it's gonna be of any use to you and because my medical
02:25:17.84 --> 02:25:21.92 elbow was blown out from my ring finger I said if I wake up and there's anything else cut off
02:25:21.92 --> 02:25:25.60 my body don't be on the right side of my back because I will choke you out from a guy
02:25:25.60 --> 02:25:33.68 and everybody and he being knowing me all too well at the time said alright I'm gonna take
02:25:33.68 --> 02:25:39.52 that as a know and everybody got a good laugh and then they knocked me out again you know but
02:25:40.88 --> 02:25:48.08 so that graft didn't take and they knocked me back out then they call on a specialist and so
02:25:48.08 --> 02:25:57.04 what they had to do was put me in a douce coma and cut my abdomen open and then put my left arm
02:25:57.04 --> 02:26:04.72 in my abdomen and then sold my abdomen shut to grow skin over my left arm so much
02:26:04.72 --> 02:26:10.88 interestingly the same Lou Paul or Junior had the same because he had severely got his hands
02:26:10.88 --> 02:26:15.28 jacked up and they did the same thing multiple times to him yeah and it's you know who to
02:26:15.28 --> 02:26:20.56 thought that's a thing you know and then they so my dad and I had this thing where I would wake
02:26:20.56 --> 02:26:25.76 up every morning because he was always there during the day then someone else had come at night
02:26:26.88 --> 02:26:34.40 and so I would say you know he'd add it's you know Monday April 16th whatever and
02:26:35.12 --> 02:26:43.44 just to make sure I still had somewhat reliable cognitive function function going on you know and I'm
02:26:43.44 --> 02:26:48.64 trying to exercise my frontal loaves as much as I can making sure these executive functions are
02:26:48.64 --> 02:26:53.04 still working the way they are because I was already told you've got post for my stress track
02:26:53.04 --> 02:26:58.88 brandry which I was like whatever you know that's made up stuff by people in white goats
02:26:58.88 --> 02:27:06.000 too much time on their hands that do will not affect me I'm I'm I'm ready no and
02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:18.72 so I'm coming out of this this coma and that was the first time that my brother came in for the
02:27:18.72 --> 02:27:27.20 first time and I remember he came in and I could see because what sucked was as early on
02:27:27.20 --> 02:27:32.000 in the induced coma like I could be a alert but I couldn't obviously could say things I was
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:39.28 animated so I did machine breathing for me I was completely paralyzed from the neck down couldn't move anything
02:27:40.48 --> 02:27:46.000 and it only lasted for the only did it for a day or so because it was so gnarly that my
02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:49.84 BP and everything would freak out my blood pressure would go up and I would see someone in my family
02:27:49.84 --> 02:27:54.56 because I felt like I was trapped in my own I'm a prisoner of my body somebody get me the hell out
02:27:54.56 --> 02:27:59.76 so where does the induced coma you can't move and can't talk nothing and yet you're conscious
02:27:59.76 --> 02:28:06.16 yeah isn't the purpose of being an induced coma right so unconscious right so they they this
02:28:06.16 --> 02:28:13.36 is just prior to them inducing the coma okay and so it was just before it but then my brother
02:28:13.36 --> 02:28:18.56 came in and it was the first time that my brother had been able to see me using college at the time
02:28:18.56 --> 02:28:24.000 and playing ball and my brother came in and sat down on the chair so well first when he goes to
02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:30.24 the walk in and I see him coming the door and they I see you and he leaves he like took a half step in
02:28:30.24 --> 02:28:36.80 and he turned around and he bolted and this is the queeziness factor no I think this was no I think
02:28:36.80 --> 02:28:42.80 it for him it was an emotion he didn't want to be emotional and me know he was emotional which
02:28:42.80 --> 02:28:47.60 I knew it did exactly why I had to leave the room so it's like it's obsolete my brother come all the way
02:28:47.60 --> 02:28:55.84 in I know you're doing and so with it he comes back in he sits down on the chair on the right
02:28:55.84 --> 02:29:01.92 side of my bed and he grabs my right hand and he puts his his forehead on my hand and he just
02:29:01.92 --> 02:29:06.96 starts crying and he just starts repeating over and over again thank you for not dying thank you for
02:29:06.96 --> 02:29:14.24 not dying and I was like dude anytime you want to shut up about that like it would be awesome
02:29:14.24 --> 02:29:20.08 because it was getting I mean it was getting to me right so my BP started going up and they're like
02:29:20.08 --> 02:29:25.28 hey you got to leave like you can't stay in here so then they realized like okay we got to
02:29:25.28 --> 02:29:29.92 we got an Aquaman out and then because they tried taping the window so I couldn't see but then
02:29:29.92 --> 02:29:34.64 it just was too much so they that's when they completely put me in the common
02:29:35.84 --> 02:29:41.92 that was for like 30 days or something and I remember coming out of it and telling my
02:29:41.92 --> 02:29:47.76 dad like induced coma was for 30 days yeah oh yeah it's a girl that around my arm and
02:29:48.96 --> 02:29:55.84 so they cut it out and then it took thankfully that was the last resort for my left arm
02:29:55.84 --> 02:30:00.88 so that intake they're gonna have to empty below my hollow within my dead weeks or I
02:30:00.88 --> 02:30:05.76 weakened I'm coming out and looking my dad my dad's money April 16 because I was like well no it's
02:30:05.76 --> 02:30:13.52 uh what was happened was and then I'm like did no one want to run this by me it was like no they
02:30:13.52 --> 02:30:21.60 figured you'd be against it so it's like whatever shit just a little matab you know it's like
02:30:22.64 --> 02:30:27.76 but I remember my dad going over water easy it was time my dad told them like hey listen
02:30:27.76 --> 02:30:32.40 I can afford to fly up here and see my son every week most of his family because I'm still
02:30:32.40 --> 02:30:36.96 not out of the woods most of his family can't afford to come to Maryland from Louisiana and
02:30:36.96 --> 02:30:43.92 her Texas to come you know see him often and so he goes to Walter Reed and just came back and he told
02:30:43.92 --> 02:30:50.40 me he said but this is your deal this is but no son of mine is gonna go to that hospital
02:30:51.44 --> 02:30:56.16 I'm obviously I'm gonna take your word for it's not like I can skip over there and go check it out
02:30:56.16 --> 02:31:03.68 and they said okay well we had a friend that worked with a pinagon it was a one star and my dad
02:31:03.68 --> 02:31:08.72 my stem on the contact them and just said hey listen we gotta get J close for the home and so I
02:31:08.72 --> 02:31:18.08 actually went to they sent me to BAMSI and San Antonio and I like to say that's accounts for 50
02:31:18.08 --> 02:31:23.36 percent of my post from that stress because I was the only marine at army facility and sorry I'm not
02:31:23.36 --> 02:31:29.44 sorry about that but it was a great hospital that you know they did just a good work as Bethesda
02:31:30.88 --> 02:31:36.72 you know but when they when they shipped me they moved me way too soon and I just my body wasn't
02:31:36.72 --> 02:31:41.84 ready for it and we had to stop and I believe it's called Scott Air Force Base in Illinois
02:31:41.84 --> 02:31:51.52 reflying yeah I'm a bird so he stopped and Scott and um I guess we didn't know that we were stopping
02:31:51.52 --> 02:32:01.04 and I had only had enough enough medications in my nerve blockers for set amount of time to get
02:32:01.04 --> 02:32:09.36 to San Antonio well that stuff was they wanted to do a little layover yeah so I'm pissed
02:32:10.64 --> 02:32:16.24 I wake up when we're there and this guanyu walks up to me he was like hey cool for sure you can
02:32:16.24 --> 02:32:25.52 welcome with Scott Air Force Base I'm guanyu shmucketelli and I was I'm like where the hell
02:32:25.52 --> 02:32:32.64 Scott Air Force Base and who the hell are you? because my my tactic at this point is gone way
02:32:32.64 --> 02:32:40.16 out the window did not matter your rank like did not matter and because I'm on a tip point where I'm
02:32:40.16 --> 02:32:46.48 like what are they gonna do shape my hands I mean all right please you'd be doing me a favor but
02:32:46.48 --> 02:32:52.80 the sun pissed and I call my dad and I'm like I don't know who fucked this up but I need you
02:32:52.80 --> 02:32:58.56 on fuck it right now and he got pissed that I was pissed and him some was out of his control you know
02:32:58.56 --> 02:33:04.24 and he was like Jake home and fine go back to go back to the test I don't care but you know and it was
02:33:04.24 --> 02:33:12.64 you know I I I was owed that in a lot more and so they gave me the hospital my buddy just
02:33:12.64 --> 02:33:17.92 started shut down so next week this is in the hospital Scott it's just you okay this is not like a
02:33:17.92 --> 02:33:24.56 major so they did like a legit let they stopped stopped like so then it's a delay for me to even
02:33:24.56 --> 02:33:31.44 go to Santonio because they had to get you to recover kind of yeah so that series of events happens
02:33:31.44 --> 02:33:40.16 there which was crazy so I go into this shock effect where you know I'm unconscious and uh this is
02:33:40.16 --> 02:33:47.12 another one of those moments where the higher power thing I'm coming out of it and uh my left
02:33:47.12 --> 02:33:55.92 head my head's turned to my left and the door to my room opens I knew whoever was about to walk
02:33:55.92 --> 02:34:04.24 in the door like I just felt like a a spiritual presence like I just felt I knew whoever that was
02:34:04.24 --> 02:34:10.08 was a person of faith like personally got knew it knew no doubt about it felt it when the door
02:34:10.08 --> 02:34:16.24 opened the dude comes around the corner and introduce himself and it's the base chaplain
02:34:16.24 --> 02:34:26.80 and I was like okay well that's that and he said hey I'm I'm chaplain so I said I knew I knew
02:34:27.60 --> 02:34:35.36 before you even for our saw you so it was the door open like I felt I felt the presence of the
02:34:35.36 --> 02:34:42.72 higher being like I felt it I knew it and I get this really like he you could tell he was
02:34:42.72 --> 02:34:47.44 moved by it you know I wouldn't say it to both smoke up as I asked I just knew the dude was a man
02:34:47.44 --> 02:34:54.40 of God and I mean it again can't explain it so the whole thing the whole word faith comes in
02:34:54.40 --> 02:35:01.68 look it up sometime yeah you'd love it but the um so then he walks in and start talking to me so
02:35:01.68 --> 02:35:07.84 we have this long conversation of which I can't remember most of that's the next day is when I'm leaving
02:35:07.84 --> 02:35:15.20 and he brings his whole family head like four or five kids and his we brought his wife
02:35:16.16 --> 02:35:24.08 and all the nurses and I mean the airmen and the reserve Marines and army guys like made this
02:35:25.36 --> 02:35:32.80 lying on either side of the back towards at the bird and it was like I don't rate what you
02:35:32.80 --> 02:35:38.48 guys are doing but appreciate it like I can dig it right but I didn't I was just thinking like
02:35:40.24 --> 02:35:47.04 it's a little much but thank you you know and that was what it was like you know who the
02:35:47.04 --> 02:35:54.56 hell I'm on to take away from there right to honor their brother and like you know who am I to do that
02:35:54.56 --> 02:36:02.88 there's just showing love all the way not halfway and so of course me being me at the time
02:36:02.88 --> 02:36:07.84 I didn't look at it that way I was just like I'm naked in front of everyone type feeling
02:36:07.84 --> 02:36:13.60 I'm just uncomfortable right now and so they they blowed me up and we fly from um Scott to
02:36:14.96 --> 02:36:21.68 we're going to Bamsi and we stop over and oh it was it was all past so
02:36:21.68 --> 02:36:28.64 and on the way I can see the load master mouth to one of the other one of the other crewman
02:36:29.68 --> 02:36:37.20 we're about to fly around a tornado I read his lips and I'm like hey god like come on man
02:36:37.76 --> 02:36:43.28 throw a dude a bone like we're about I'm gonna survive all the stuff I've survived and if you let me
02:36:43.28 --> 02:36:51.04 get taken out by a tornado like we're gonna be fighting this bullshit but I'm just thinking like
02:36:51.92 --> 02:36:58.80 Murphy back off bro just back off but it's just this these little moments where you find light
02:36:58.80 --> 02:37:04.08 and these heavy situations and I didn't know that we were stopping in all past so we stopped
02:37:04.08 --> 02:37:08.24 in all past on our pissed why are we stopping and why aren't we in San Antonio?
02:37:08.24 --> 02:37:14.40 Well because we had to drop off someone who was gay I ain't in there should return in the
02:37:14.40 --> 02:37:23.04 body and I was like okay I'm a major dick like get it you know it was like shit could you
02:37:23.04 --> 02:37:27.76 told me that and they probably did tell me but I'm on so many drugs I'm gonna remember about
02:37:27.76 --> 02:37:33.92 point two seconds of an hour conversation I had with you so we get to San Antonio again my body
02:37:33.92 --> 02:37:39.68 was bad and me my body's good does the same thing it did it Scott and next thing I know I'm in the
02:37:39.68 --> 02:37:52.48 ICU again and now the OR and I end up doing 15 months in in BAMPSY and man every operation it was
02:37:52.48 --> 02:37:57.60 just more drugs more drugs more drugs more drugs the series of events happens at BAMPSY I'm the
02:37:57.60 --> 02:38:04.000 only marine there which I stated and it was bad because I mean you can only call a marine
02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:09.76 soldier so many times before I'm gonna let you know that that bothers me and if I wanted to be
02:38:09.76 --> 02:38:14.32 a soldier I would have joined the freaking army stop calling me a soldier let's just the marine
02:38:14.32 --> 02:38:22.08 thing it's a pride thing absolutely a freaking pride thing if you don't like it would you
02:38:22.08 --> 02:38:29.60 call trusty pull a soldier because if you would you're ignorant and my thing was is like just
02:38:29.60 --> 02:38:36.24 you'd allow some tact and so they ended up putting the the EGA the Marine Corps seal on my door
02:38:37.28 --> 02:38:46.56 and let just to let people know yeah same rules though you don't share my DNA and I know I say
02:38:46.56 --> 02:38:54.40 this marine don't come in my room still so I didn't meet I missed I missed out on meeting a lot
02:38:54.40 --> 02:39:01.20 of quote unquote famous people and and politicians that I'm sure they're because they care and
02:39:02.16 --> 02:39:06.88 a bunch of other people and it was because of that rule and then the secretary of the army
02:39:07.84 --> 02:39:12.64 or the surgeon general once started surgery was coming and they were like horrible
02:39:12.64 --> 02:39:18.16 trick we really you know we need you to wake up and shave and you're gonna come see the
02:39:18.16 --> 02:39:27.60 surgeon general and I was like okay yeah I'm gonna do that obviously I didn't and so I have
02:39:27.60 --> 02:39:32.000 people coming out to my room and they're like couple sheck this surgeon general's downstairs
02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:35.44 you were supposed to be in your electrical wheelchair down there meeting them and I'm like what
02:39:35.44 --> 02:39:41.20 part of my face has I give a shit that they're here I don't even know if it's a man or woman
02:39:41.20 --> 02:39:50.08 I don't care if they want to see me you know where my room is do I go to his or her office
02:39:50.96 --> 02:39:57.68 and say hey I'm gonna need you downstairs because I'm coming no no I don't there are
02:39:57.68 --> 02:40:02.56 persons just like me except they probably some tell you that pain levels probably not where mine
02:40:02.56 --> 02:40:09.92 is right now and no I'm not gonna shave either so you can just just eat a whole bag of
02:40:09.92 --> 02:40:18.000 dicks because I don't care and so again great patient really really good patient so you're
02:40:18.88 --> 02:40:23.52 the drugs at this point that they're putting you on mass all kind of pain killers and
02:40:25.68 --> 02:40:31.04 do you even is there any point where you start realizing like oh I'm not gonna be okay
02:40:31.04 --> 02:40:36.64 without these things I want them all the time not once so at this point no so you're just thinking
02:40:36.64 --> 02:40:39.04 that's just the way it is yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
02:40:39.04 --> 02:40:44.16 I'm badly wounded I need paint killers part of the game yeah right part of the game and so
02:40:44.16 --> 02:40:52.32 at this point I'm thinking I have this is probably operation like 35 36 and it's so bad that they
02:40:52.32 --> 02:40:58.32 have me now I'm having a recover in the ICU after every operation because they have an monitor
02:40:59.04 --> 02:41:04.48 my breathing in my heart rate because I'm on so many drugs and so at this point they've given me
02:41:04.48 --> 02:41:11.68 what they feel like okay we cannot just give them more of any we can't give them more to
02:41:11.68 --> 02:41:17.68 a lot of them are all are fentanyl or etc etc so they give me this is the first time that I had
02:41:17.68 --> 02:41:28.000 experience after one of these operations ketamine and I was such a bad because the guy
02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:35.84 comes in to started ministering the ketamine and I'll never forget this and he goes he starts to
02:41:35.84 --> 02:41:42.48 minister through my one of my V come into my pickle on and he says that you fill it yet
02:41:43.28 --> 02:41:49.76 like nope keep pushing fill it yet no I started to fill it the second time he asked what I was like
02:41:49.76 --> 02:41:59.12 nope it's like oh all right fill the nope nothing this time I definitely fill it but I'm
02:41:59.12 --> 02:42:05.52 lying because again if one pill is good I bet you tens awesome my mind said right so the fourth time
02:42:05.52 --> 02:42:10.88 he asked me I might oh yeah all right my fill it and he was like okay because I just I don't think
02:42:10.88 --> 02:42:16.24 I've ever given any not much but they say your tolerance is really really high so you know what is
02:42:16.24 --> 02:42:22.80 well I mean I started I mean the door didn't even shut all the way and I started hallucinating my balls off
02:42:22.80 --> 02:42:29.76 I'm on so much ketamine you know the street apparently street terminology for a special K
02:42:31.76 --> 02:42:39.76 and I didn't even know like that was the thing and it was it was Narlie I mean I was seeing
02:42:39.76 --> 02:42:47.52 things that weren't there I was it was bad and I came out of that and I told my
02:42:47.52 --> 02:42:52.08 leaves physician that came I said don't ever I don't want that stuff anymore like that was not
02:42:52.48 --> 02:42:57.60 like that was not a cool high like it was bad I don't like it and there I go we're gonna
02:42:57.60 --> 02:43:02.48 have to put you back in the ice y'all's like I do not care I'll live in the ice you it's not like I'm
02:43:02.48 --> 02:43:08.72 in the rits okay if I'm in the ice you I'm in this room with four other dude like it doesn't matter
02:43:08.72 --> 02:43:17.52 whatever right and um obviously I developed a development of a reputation at BAMC and
02:43:19.04 --> 02:43:25.20 I'm attached to four three condoms there at the time and it's right out right by BAMC
02:43:25.84 --> 02:43:32.32 and there's one marine there that the day I got there he was right there and he was a staff
02:43:32.32 --> 02:43:40.08 sort of at the time and he told me when I got there he'd brother I'm gonna come see you every day
02:43:40.08 --> 02:43:46.24 in this with you well so did the I don't remember if he was the first one or a star major at the time
02:43:47.12 --> 02:43:52.64 said the same thing well there's a lot of cameras there you know seeing it in fox and crap because
02:43:52.64 --> 02:43:58.56 I'm you know the only marine or facility got some attention and so that guy says the same thing
02:43:58.56 --> 02:44:05.92 well I didn't see him again but the the first guy the staffs are every day man every day
02:44:06.64 --> 02:44:12.08 and he started like he would walk in and like tickle where my right foot should be and it
02:44:12.08 --> 02:44:15.68 would tick it was crazy because it would tickle and it would not be like that come on bro
02:44:16.72 --> 02:44:21.60 and he would he would just laugh and laugh he thought it was the best thing ever and it was just
02:44:21.60 --> 02:44:28.88 those little moments though those little nuances of time that would light make me forget that I was
02:44:28.88 --> 02:44:38.88 who I was and I was in the situation I was in that would make me realize you know if if I think
02:44:38.88 --> 02:44:46.40 it's that bad I would get when I was able to get mobile I remember actually that was an isolation
02:44:46.40 --> 02:44:55.44 when I showed up who's the second marine at Banssey and they told me hey there's another marine
02:44:55.44 --> 02:45:02.80 on deck just he's getting he just got here but then I'm thinking he's gonna make it my side I
02:45:02.80 --> 02:45:08.000 need to see I need to go see him right now like while you're in isolation I do not give a shit
02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:12.32 I'm gonna go see him right now or you're gonna have to kill me it's all the way I'm not seeing them
02:45:12.32 --> 02:45:21.60 so they're like okay and they get the little human train and train me up and put me in my
02:45:21.60 --> 02:45:26.64 black electrical church all the my black had a black thing was legit they took it from me though
02:45:26.64 --> 02:45:32.96 I put one too many holes in the walls of the don't drive your electric wheelchair
02:45:32.96 --> 02:45:43.36 and heavily medicated folks that's it but I go see Ty do you why right I want those to
02:45:44.48 --> 02:45:52.16 believe it or not I got one of those and but I go see Ty mind you this time at this point
02:45:52.80 --> 02:45:58.72 I still haven't gotten like emotional one time like it's since I left
02:45:58.72 --> 02:46:04.96 do love like I haven't gotten emotional from my family or otherwise still pretty
02:46:04.96 --> 02:46:10.88 squared away with the emhole emotion thing I go see Ty and I go into his room and he's
02:46:11.92 --> 02:46:18.88 completely wrapped up I mean the front half of his cranium was blown off I mean it was
02:46:19.44 --> 02:46:26.96 he was blind one I severely burned I mean bad I mean look like a mommy when I saw him
02:46:26.96 --> 02:46:36.32 no ears were burned off eyelids nose lips and I remember I had to yell at his nurse who's
02:46:36.32 --> 02:46:43.36 just giant black dude just giant black harming guy and I had to yell at him who had to then
02:46:43.36 --> 02:46:51.36 lean down and yell in the side of Ty's head so he could know what was going on and I just told
02:46:51.36 --> 02:46:55.52 him that told the nurse my guy and there's like hey brother I just want to come see my family
02:46:55.52 --> 02:47:02.000 because I heard another Marine was on deck and I was like right on and now we can take over this
02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:12.40 hospital and so I leaned down he said hey Ty another Marine and Ty like put up his is not like
02:47:12.40 --> 02:47:19.20 oh yeah Marines and and Ty whispered to the nurse and he said he wants to know like what are your
02:47:19.20 --> 02:47:25.92 injuries and I told him you know told him my injuries and uh started of course with you know
02:47:25.92 --> 02:47:31.68 a lost right leg didn't lose it you know he said I know where I went but told started with that
02:47:31.68 --> 02:47:36.24 and he was whist he was telling Ty as I'm telling the injuries and it's seen as a
02:47:36.24 --> 02:47:41.92 sin lost right leg like Ty holds up his right leg like still got mine was it down
02:47:42.80 --> 02:47:48.000 and the left leg got banged up Bob I'm Ty holds up his left leg and it was like doing this
02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:58.08 typical typical Marine banter right there considering the conditions we're in yet we're just
02:47:58.08 --> 02:48:04.56 gonna smoke and joke because that's what family does to get through the arc time you got to find
02:48:04.56 --> 02:48:11.36 light and regardless of how dark the situation is because if you don't they will kill you
02:48:11.36 --> 02:48:19.12 but I remember having this interaction with Ty and I left the room and I'm facing the
02:48:19.12 --> 02:48:26.08 nurse's station when I come out in the door shuts and I just completely and utterly broke down
02:48:27.68 --> 02:48:33.84 to the point of anger like I was I was sobbing in the angry I was so angry
02:48:33.84 --> 02:48:42.56 seeing him that way and seeing and I just like just yell like those bastards like what you know
02:48:42.56 --> 02:48:50.32 what why what are we doing what are we doing what are we doing what are we gonna do about that
02:48:51.28 --> 02:48:59.04 and it piss me off not only because here I see my brother that is never ever ever gonna be remotely
02:48:59.04 --> 02:49:09.04 the same as he ever was before but then it reminded me in a very abrupt manner who the hell are you
02:49:10.96 --> 02:49:19.68 to be acting the way you're acting because they're telling his family you better call
02:49:19.68 --> 02:49:24.08 anyone who wants to tell him goodbye because he's probably not gonna make it through the next 48 hours
02:49:24.08 --> 02:49:33.52 and here I was acting like a complete asset very much alive not having they weren't having to
02:49:33.52 --> 02:49:38.48 call anyone of my family or any of my friends because I was gonna make it at this point I'm gonna
02:49:38.48 --> 02:49:48.96 make it and that reminded me of it's not about you you just thought it was about you it's not about you
02:49:48.96 --> 02:50:00.48 and then that that one interaction taught me right then okay I need to go see every wounded person
02:50:00.48 --> 02:50:08.96 in this hospital as often as I can because that's where I found healing so that's what I did
02:50:08.96 --> 02:50:16.40 I saw every wounded person talked to all their families and that is when I realized that
02:50:16.40 --> 02:50:22.96 gather there's really something of the service of yourself because not only does it feed my
02:50:22.96 --> 02:50:38.08 soul it feeds theirs it's mutually beneficial and I learned if you're not willing to use
02:50:38.08 --> 02:50:47.44 whatever platform you find yourself in and to make yourself 100% vulnerable for whatever make um you
02:50:47.44 --> 02:50:53.52 will never make a difference you're waking up and choosing to be status quo
02:50:55.76 --> 02:51:04.64 and choosing to be average and I learned right then the great the great ones the ones that the
02:51:04.64 --> 02:51:11.12 history books are gonna rave about and that do rave about were consistently uncomfortable
02:51:12.80 --> 02:51:21.84 and consistently vulnerable and that was a great lesson for me to learn and I didn't make
02:51:21.84 --> 02:51:30.08 me any better than anyone else it just made me more susceptible to judgment which already had a
02:51:30.08 --> 02:51:38.08 ton of so I didn't care but I remember being and thinking about this pride of being a
02:51:38.08 --> 02:51:45.12 United States Marine and representing what that means and thinking about gunny you know the salty gunny
02:51:46.24 --> 02:51:52.64 back in Iraq and thinking how would he behave how would he react how would what would he do
02:51:52.64 --> 02:52:00.32 same thing about first order and I'm actually let's back up back to I'm gonna give an example of what
02:52:00.32 --> 02:52:07.92 being tribal truly means that you can't buy so I'm back into fes that my dad tells me
02:52:07.92 --> 02:52:16.16 hey Jake first order and greens gonna come see you and I remember thinking shit he's I'm sure he's
02:52:16.16 --> 02:52:23.28 pissed because I got hit and he's probably just gonna finish the job so I was terrified right I'm
02:52:23.28 --> 02:52:30.000 terrified because I I'm not only do I respect this man to the end to agree but I love this man
02:52:31.84 --> 02:52:38.000 and I was like I don't want to experience what I'm about to have to experience I'd rather
02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:42.96 take the cowards way out so I was like I'm sure I could like I'm I'm passed out when he walks in
02:52:42.96 --> 02:52:51.20 I'm on a lot of drugs that'll work so I hear not call the door I'm like here the door open
02:52:52.08 --> 02:52:56.24 I'm dead say you're getting your first one hurry at first horse walks in so I'm like
02:52:56.24 --> 02:53:02.96 I gotta pass out as soon as you bust the hatch and walks in my freaking heart monitor dime
02:53:02.96 --> 02:53:09.84 is me out because it goes from like the slow steady beep to the the rapid beep and I'm like
02:53:09.84 --> 02:53:15.84 I'm up there obviously this isn't gonna work and there is no plan to be I'm awake and he
02:53:15.84 --> 02:53:24.64 looks at my family I'm in my dad's in there my mom my step mom my aunt my cousins my brother
02:53:24.64 --> 02:53:32.88 my sister and my and he says hey Mr. guy you doing he's got that raspy voice I don't
02:53:32.88 --> 02:53:38.48 imagine being on the drill field as long as he was the help and he said we're doing our
02:53:38.48 --> 02:53:43.36 hanging in there first son he said it could go could go hey you want to have him in with my brother
02:53:43.36 --> 02:53:49.76 my dad was like sure you know go ahead first order like he was gonna turn around come talk to me
02:53:49.76 --> 02:53:54.80 there by in the room he looks right at my father and says yeah I'm gonna need y'all get to hell out
02:53:56.72 --> 02:54:02.32 and I was just thinking he's about to kill me right now so and he comes up to decide
02:54:02.32 --> 02:54:09.76 my bed and remember the only thing worse my right arm and first one it leans down he puts his
02:54:09.76 --> 02:54:17.92 right arm out as if to like pick me up and so I grab like I clap hands with him as if he's gonna
02:54:17.92 --> 02:54:26.72 pick me up right and he puts the back of his hand on my heart and the back with my hand on his
02:54:26.72 --> 02:54:33.44 and he leans down further and puts his forehead on my forehead and he sits there for about three minutes
02:54:35.20 --> 02:54:41.84 he stands up he packs me on my face and he walks out to this day
02:54:42.88 --> 02:54:47.68 this is one of the most powerful conversations I've ever had in my life and not one word was spoken
02:54:49.84 --> 02:54:56.64 that's being tribal that's tribal that goes much deeper than team you can't train them
02:54:56.64 --> 02:55:03.76 and he walks out of the room and obviously gets emotional when you walk out because my dad walks in
02:55:03.76 --> 02:55:09.04 and I get emotional as soon as you walk out because God forbid we try for him one another can't do that
02:55:09.04 --> 02:55:13.12 my dad walks in and sees me emotional and he went hey first one and he looks at me and
02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.32 like it was a possible look on his face and he just goes
02:55:16.32 --> 02:55:27.68 he marines a fricking weird I was like get out banker you're a banker and it was one of those
02:55:27.68 --> 02:55:37.68 moments man that only people who have bear the burden of a purpose much greater than themselves
02:55:37.68 --> 02:55:45.92 willingly and openly knowing what the odds could be what the odds are what the outcomes could be
02:55:47.28 --> 02:55:54.000 only the people that are willing to love all the way regardless of the amount of pain
02:55:55.52 --> 02:56:04.000 could understand and appreciate that moment I mean and I'm proud to say that that man's now the
02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:11.84 Sergeant Major of the United States Marine Corps there's not a more deserving individual I can think of
02:56:14.16 --> 02:56:21.36 because that guy that guy's one of the guys I found fall on the blood trail that taught me
02:56:22.32 --> 02:56:28.64 if you're gonna love doing it all the way don't waste anyones time doing the halfway thing
02:56:28.64 --> 02:56:36.96 that was an amazing moment that I will take to my grave cherishing knowing that
02:56:38.72 --> 02:56:44.32 that guy just told me without telling me it's okay to not be okay
02:56:47.60 --> 02:56:48.16 it's okay
02:56:48.16 --> 02:57:06.08 I what point did you realize that the drugs were a legit problem the day I was leaving San Antonio the
02:57:09.52 --> 02:57:15.60 the committee general the hospital was ended up getting pretty close to me at my time
02:57:15.60 --> 02:57:22.40 there my time there said came out and he's we're walking out or well he's walking I'm rolling
02:57:22.40 --> 02:57:27.20 I'm still not walking well at this point and he says I'm going to check out over
02:57:28.96 --> 02:57:36.08 it's four three con and he says you know Jake I feel like we should name a haul or something after
02:57:36.08 --> 02:57:41.52 you got for all the shit you put us there I was like hey sir let me do the infamy thing all I can
02:57:41.52 --> 02:57:46.96 let me handle I got it all my lonesome I don't need your help you know and
02:57:49.12 --> 02:58:00.56 he was like you know it's sad to see you go I'm it's I said why I'm I'm scared to death to leave
02:58:02.48 --> 02:58:07.84 and I remember I I basically got a giant bag of drugs before I went over to
02:58:07.84 --> 02:58:16.72 four three con the last thing I did with him was sign of page 11 and because I the higher
02:58:16.72 --> 02:58:22.56 out that told me I'm gonna be every day I told him when I thought about that when what I thought
02:58:22.56 --> 02:58:28.72 about him and so he showed me I'm making me sign of page 11 and I was like put it on my tab bro
02:58:28.72 --> 02:58:34.64 what's the page 11 slap on the wrist pretty much but you can't be promoted for I think it's
02:58:34.64 --> 02:58:42.08 12 months with page 11 and so I was just like he was in DC at the time when I checked out
02:58:42.96 --> 02:58:46.80 and the gunny there was like hey he said he wanted to talk to you know it was like get him on
02:58:46.80 --> 02:58:53.04 speaker phone was taught and I said I told him when I thought about him it was inappropriate and
02:58:53.04 --> 02:58:59.52 I'm not sorry um but he's like you're in the page 11 and gunny was like oh do you want to
02:58:59.52 --> 02:59:08.56 contest this it's like hell no put it on my tab bro oh my wow and um man I had this bag of drugs
02:59:08.56 --> 02:59:13.52 and my brother met up there with me and my brother was gonna drive me the Florida where I was going
02:59:15.36 --> 02:59:23.92 checking a massive 21 and I knew right then because I was like okay at this point I'd already
02:59:23.92 --> 02:59:29.04 started like if I was eating one if I had a family member friend give me a fentanyl pop out of my
02:59:29.60 --> 02:59:34.000 bag of goodies like I would chew it I'd bite it off the stick chew it up and swallow it and
02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:38.96 just lay on the stick and I'd be like hey so who's gonna grab me a fentanyl pop like I
02:59:38.96 --> 02:59:46.64 jake we just gave you know you didn't you thought you did but you didn't I knew like because I was
02:59:46.64 --> 02:59:53.76 like hey listen if I just can't fill nothing matters if I'm completely numb nothing matters
02:59:53.76 --> 03:00:01.60 and then when they gave me that giant bag I was like oh shit I knew how I was gonna end
03:00:02.56 --> 03:00:08.32 well it was like yeah well this is like this is I don't remember they told me like a three months
03:00:08.32 --> 03:00:17.20 supply and I was like no this is like a three weeks supply and um man I started that's how I
03:00:17.20 --> 03:00:25.68 integrated I'm back into civilian society was high as a kite knowing that if I don't have to
03:00:25.68 --> 03:00:34.08 fill and I can do go through this thing numb nothing matters because if you can't fill it who cares
03:00:34.08 --> 03:00:41.76 you know I mean who cares and it was something that really was um it just got worse and worse
03:00:41.76 --> 03:00:49.12 I mean essentially what I did for a year and a half was chase my first high so I did and I
03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:58.56 was finally for about a year there I slept with an over and under 12 gay shotguns
03:00:58.56 --> 03:01:05.20 condition one next to my bed every night and every day I talk myself out of
03:01:05.20 --> 03:01:18.24 utilizing it to end my own life to to where I was almost at the point where I had decided
03:01:19.36 --> 03:01:27.12 why it was okay to do it and I had justified it in my head and why it would be better
03:01:27.12 --> 03:01:43.12 for everyone in my life and around my circle if I was gone and so I but then I was told by family
03:01:43.12 --> 03:01:49.68 that you know you shake the difference between and at this point I'm taking about 55 pills
03:01:49.68 --> 03:01:52.88 three times a day and I was eating between eight and twelve four hundred milligrams and I'll
03:01:52.88 --> 03:01:59.28 pass a day I was on enough medication to kill a village in Africa it was not really and
03:01:59.28 --> 03:02:05.20 the fact that I never indeed I mean there's no medical explanation for that and so I
03:02:05.20 --> 03:02:11.68 where were all the drugs coming from? You get them make a phone call get them home yeah
03:02:11.68 --> 03:02:16.48 and so it was that was the least of my worries on how to get the drugs because
03:02:16.48 --> 03:02:24.08 but and to be fair because I was on so much as I came out of the hospital it took a lot to keep me
03:02:25.36 --> 03:02:31.52 where I was I mean if I if I'm even ten minutes late was ten minutes late on one dose
03:02:31.52 --> 03:02:40.08 I'm starting to withdrawal I mean it was bad and so finally I get told you know the difference
03:02:40.08 --> 03:02:47.36 between you living the way you're living and eating a bullet is it's time but the outcome is the
03:02:47.36 --> 03:02:53.12 same you're just slowly killing yourself you look to your brothers it didn't come home and those
03:02:53.12 --> 03:02:58.000 that didn't still love and respect you to not only live but live well because that's the only
03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:07.20 way you can truly honor them is by living well I mean that hit me heart and I realized I'm being
03:03:07.20 --> 03:03:17.28 self-respected so what I'm doing I'm I'm carrying out every day like a victim and I'm not a victim
03:03:17.28 --> 03:03:23.36 I'm a victim I'm a victim I need to start acting like it and so I called my lead physician the next
03:03:23.36 --> 03:03:26.88 one and I said it didn't even do I can get off all the drugs so she said how you're going to do that
03:03:27.68 --> 03:03:33.92 so I'm just not taking the first dose just stopping she said I had highly advised against that
03:03:33.92 --> 03:03:39.92 so why is that so because you probably have a massive heart attack and die I said Roger that
03:03:39.92 --> 03:03:44.96 plan is no go what's planned you look like and she's like you're gonna have to come back to
03:03:44.96 --> 03:03:49.04 BAM see we're gonna have to ween you off the drugs which is not what I wanted to hear
03:03:50.08 --> 03:03:55.04 because it was like when I left him so you're already saying he had to go on like no need to ever come
03:03:55.04 --> 03:04:03.84 back here done do you and done and I was like oh shit all right and I went back there and started
03:04:03.84 --> 03:04:09.12 that process man and let me tell you something I consider and tell you a conviction I know
03:04:09.12 --> 03:04:17.68 why addicts they addicts because that slow withdrawal process of getting clean
03:04:19.44 --> 03:04:28.64 I mean this whole heartedly I don't know what was harder being blown up or getting clean
03:04:28.64 --> 03:04:36.16 I honestly don't know what was harder because I mean hell coming off the drugs they gave you drugs
03:04:36.16 --> 03:04:45.04 to help you come off the drugs and it's like I just you know what the frick it didn't there
03:04:45.04 --> 03:04:49.84 shot or something you can give me and I can get the hell out of here and but there's not how long
03:04:49.84 --> 03:04:56.56 was the process supposed to be six months so I did two and a half I was clean
03:04:56.56 --> 03:05:04.32 because I was like I'm not I can't continue to be this that that hardcore about face though I mean
03:05:05.12 --> 03:05:10.88 that that comment about look which I've said on this podcast many times like look we got to live
03:05:10.88 --> 03:05:16.16 to honor our brothers that didn't come home that's the way it is live well and you get you got
03:05:16.16 --> 03:05:22.96 to live the best possible life you can they don't have that opportunity that thought right there
03:05:22.96 --> 03:05:34.08 is what did it um no because again it was a myriad of things man because again you
03:05:36.24 --> 03:05:40.64 that was the the tipping point but again it's like the people that come over to say you know
03:05:40.64 --> 03:05:45.84 what's the problem is yeah okay I bet you there's more than one so that tipping point
03:05:45.84 --> 03:05:49.84 water some other contributing factors and the reason I'm asking you this so people are
03:05:49.84 --> 03:05:54.80 listening this right now and they're feeling the way you were feeling yep I got a phone call
03:05:54.80 --> 03:06:07.20 about the our first loss from our unit my is on hand and I was like that's done more than
03:06:07.20 --> 03:06:15.28 I thought that would sting and I can't do that to the tribe on top of that there's I can't
03:06:15.28 --> 03:06:22.96 I need to get my shift together and it's gonna be ugly and it's gonna be sloppy and it's not
03:06:22.96 --> 03:06:33.60 gonna be it's gonna be the antithesis of what it should look like but I owe that to them
03:06:33.60 --> 03:06:49.44 I owe that to him that is when I decided that you know what I'm gonna I'm going to try
03:06:49.44 --> 03:07:04.48 really hard to do this life thing the way that I'm supposed to do it I mean I'm gonna go out of my way
03:07:04.16 --> 03:07:12.48 to be to where when my brothers here my name they can smile and their chest can swallow a
03:07:12.48 --> 03:07:22.40 pride and they can say yeah that's my brother yeah that right there is that thing that I was talking
03:07:22.40 --> 03:07:28.000 about earlier like I don't care what anybody thinks when it comes to my brothers and what they think
03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:33.84 yeah that means a lot man yeah that cares it's shit on a way yeah that's that's the stuff
03:07:33.84 --> 03:07:43.36 it's the stuff that'll change the world so you so you go through the two and a half months
03:07:43.68 --> 03:07:50.64 and you get clean what's the temptation like once you're clean are you are you feeling like
03:07:50.64 --> 03:07:58.48 I mean is it always there what is it for a while bro for a while it's all day every day
03:07:58.48 --> 03:08:05.28 every time I leave my room or I have to talk to someone rather I'm related to him or not
03:08:05.28 --> 03:08:10.64 or got for a bit I have to go to like the mall or some shit all I thought about for a while
03:08:11.36 --> 03:08:19.12 was man this would be so much easier if I was I right now all the time so I thought about for a while
03:08:19.12 --> 03:08:26.88 what about booze yeah right so that's a that's a that's a pretty that's a pretty
03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:37.12 pretty good safety net and that go from one bad habit to another and you know my family
03:08:37.12 --> 03:08:42.72 doesn't need help and that every and either and so yeah I was like hey listen you know I mean
03:08:42.72 --> 03:08:50.32 I'm not on enough drugs to kill her elephants anymore so I can I could probably just start drinking now
03:08:53.52 --> 03:08:59.44 yeah so little that I realized how awesome food was when I got off all the drugs and I was like
03:08:59.44 --> 03:09:05.68 oh my god food is amazing and I love it because I was amazed the idea about when I went to Iraq
03:09:05.68 --> 03:09:10.72 I easily wait I was probably at 2205 solid I was in some of the best shape of all that
03:09:10.72 --> 03:09:19.84 ever in my life when I love Bansie I ain't always at 162 and then because all I did was
03:09:19.84 --> 03:09:27.12 no shit was drink get rid and capuccinos I didn't eat ever because you feel like you're starving
03:09:27.12 --> 03:09:33.20 like you're really hungry that's why you this saying go you'll never need a fat drug addict
03:09:34.08 --> 03:09:39.52 that's true because you your mind's gonna tell you like oh my god I'm starving then you eat one
03:09:39.52 --> 03:09:46.000 bite of something and it's like you ate an entire cow by yourself and it's just full and then so I
03:09:47.36 --> 03:09:55.36 immediately because we need to remember too there are a myriad of forms of self-medicating
03:09:56.80 --> 03:10:01.52 not just drugs and alcohol I mean it can go on and on and on
03:10:03.12 --> 03:10:08.16 well that's something we need to remember because there's gonna be some people out there that hear
03:10:08.16 --> 03:10:12.64 this and I'm like oh well you know I don't drink excess well you're on the on drugs
03:10:15.12 --> 03:10:26.24 well there's a lot of other avenues what else food oh god I mean porn
03:10:29.36 --> 03:10:33.76 let me exercise I mean there's a million things that you could do in excess
03:10:33.76 --> 03:10:43.28 that you think is gonna save you from your own head yeah it's like an escape right like an escape
03:10:43.92 --> 03:10:51.36 and it brings like that pleasure for that exact yeah you get the same you get the same in
03:10:51.36 --> 03:10:58.24 doorphones release the same that same dopamine and get that same feeling of oh this okay this
03:10:58.24 --> 03:11:07.60 yeah all right so because in all it is all it is is a protection mechanism to keep you from having
03:11:09.36 --> 03:11:15.28 to look inward and go deep into the thing underneath the thing underneath the thing it's all it is
03:11:16.40 --> 03:11:24.24 it's all it is and it's it's very very easy to do I mean because just being humans alone we
03:11:24.24 --> 03:11:31.28 are all addictive by nature I mean we are all to whatever it could be and so we have to be
03:11:32.24 --> 03:11:41.44 cognizant of the fact that you know there's we have to consistently remember that
03:11:44.40 --> 03:11:51.04 we are all always gonna be human we're always gonna be uncomfortable change
03:11:51.04 --> 03:11:57.52 most most people like regimented schedules they like to get up a certain time like a drink
03:11:57.52 --> 03:12:01.44 certain thing eat a certain thing workout a certain time go to lunch a certain time
03:12:02.56 --> 03:12:08.72 by nature all of us hate change anyone who's in a company that goes through a big
03:12:08.72 --> 03:12:15.76 transnis for a big change you know what I'm talking about but we always have to remember that
03:12:15.76 --> 03:12:26.24 just like in the Marines we always say temper gumby the more comfortable you get being uncomfortable
03:12:27.36 --> 03:12:38.40 the happier you're gonna be so at what point in this you get clean what point do you decide
03:12:40.24 --> 03:12:44.40 you're gonna do something significant to try and help other people and you start
03:12:44.40 --> 03:12:50.56 you actually wanted to kill great question well I didn't decide it it was my grandmother told me
03:12:50.56 --> 03:12:59.68 hey I want you to come speak to my rotary club and you know being a man from the south you
03:12:59.68 --> 03:13:05.84 don't tell your grandmother no so I was like okay I'm gonna reluctantly do this and hate it the
03:13:05.84 --> 03:13:12.72 entire time and I did and I showed up and I was easily 40 years by at least 40 years the junior
03:13:12.72 --> 03:13:22.000 in the room so I start telling my story and I'm sweating grenades so uncomfortable I could think about
03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:31.20 was like I would love to just crush like 10th and I'll pop right now and it was horrific I mean it was
03:13:31.20 --> 03:13:38.08 a freight train screwing on abortion it was bad but so it was one of those things that like but
03:13:38.08 --> 03:13:43.68 you can't look away type thing it was one of those but I remember walking out of there and I walked
03:13:43.68 --> 03:13:49.76 out of the building I'll never forgive the side of the building and I took a deep breath like
03:13:51.76 --> 03:13:58.48 you made it and then I took that deep breath I was like huh I feel lighter
03:13:58.48 --> 03:14:09.44 I mean not physically my soul fell lighter and I was like oh then it clicked that's what she was
03:14:09.44 --> 03:14:22.32 doing it's tactical therapy I get it that freaking broad she got me because I was I refused to talk to
03:14:22.32 --> 03:14:30.08 I talked to the sidecasters once I got to the hospital and then when I left then when I was getting
03:14:30.08 --> 03:14:37.60 out of the Marine Corps for the VA process and that was it so two or three times because I had nothing
03:14:37.60 --> 03:14:43.28 to say to them was that PTSD that's in TBI thing it's not whatever it's not a real thing
03:14:43.28 --> 03:14:54.24 when I got clean and started to drink and I was like oh shit let's PTSD to TBI I think
03:14:54.24 --> 03:15:04.32 are very, very, very real like very, and I moved came back to what back taxes and I was
03:15:04.32 --> 03:15:13.20 introduced to a couple guys who started to foundation down there and there a couple of seals
03:15:14.24 --> 03:15:21.44 to this day great friends of mine mentors of mine brothers for sure and I called Flipper one in
03:15:21.44 --> 03:15:30.80 Flipper two and that's when I was kind of introduced to the nonprofit world and working with
03:15:30.80 --> 03:15:38.56 warriors and their families and first responders and law enforcement officers and their families
03:15:39.84 --> 03:15:48.96 you know it was like they clicked with me like I like I like this I'm never going to get rich or
03:15:48.96 --> 03:15:58.88 wealthy doing this and that's not the point that gave me more that put more in my soul tank
03:15:58.88 --> 03:16:08.40 than any pill or any bottle ever did and it made me realize like oh all right this is the same
03:16:08.40 --> 03:16:15.36 reason I went and visited all the wounded every time I could even we lost guys and the hospital
03:16:15.36 --> 03:16:24.48 like this is why I'm doing this it's greater than me it reminds me daily how insignificant I am
03:16:24.48 --> 03:16:36.16 that I'm just another guy that's just using the do stuff that's out of the norm it's hard stuff
03:16:37.28 --> 03:16:41.20 we have anything we're doing should be should be hard it's not we're doing alone
03:16:42.48 --> 03:16:46.72 and when I was working with this organization I was surrounded by people better than me
03:16:46.72 --> 03:16:57.76 by default I was better and consistently pushed harder and harder because I wanted to be held
03:16:57.76 --> 03:17:02.72 with different standards again because even then I wasn't waking up like I'm gonna go out
03:17:02.72 --> 03:17:11.20 my way to be average today no because I had two freaking navy seals that you know we're worried
03:17:11.20 --> 03:17:16.72 they had to have really good tans and they're there had to be great and they had to have this
03:17:16.72 --> 03:17:24.96 one type of really cool sunglasses and I was like hey what I'm gonna do is just I'm just gonna
03:17:24.96 --> 03:17:31.68 work these dudes yeah I can't use a weapon anymore I'm not gonna outrun them God knows I'm not gonna
03:17:31.68 --> 03:17:42.72 out swim a pride can out shoot them I'm about to simply dig up but I could probably home
03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:50.88 yeah I could probably work with the most important tool we all have no important weapon we all have
03:17:52.08 --> 03:17:59.52 I could probably get to where I could out think them so I started to to this date
03:17:59.52 --> 03:18:06.56 it's it's toss up but oh with one of them one of them I passed them all time ago but
03:18:07.28 --> 03:18:12.88 they know they are too that's what makes it even more beautiful but that's when I realized
03:18:12.88 --> 03:18:20.000 like all right I need to be this is what I gotta do this is this is what I'm gonna be called to do
03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:30.24 is to talk to other members of society who've been dealt whatever hand or been dealt a
03:18:30.24 --> 03:18:37.44 blow to let them know like hey yeah right now it sucks but you can come out the other side
03:18:39.28 --> 03:18:46.24 because don't get in that deep darker abit hole don't do that because very few people come out of that
03:18:46.24 --> 03:18:53.84 I know because I tried it over and over again and I never got out of it on my own always took help
03:18:55.20 --> 03:19:00.56 and so at the time in 2012 that's when the study came out from the VA
03:19:02.08 --> 03:19:12.24 on average 22 veterans a day die by suicide and so another marine and a couple of marine's
03:19:12.24 --> 03:19:18.96 business guy got together and Dallas and they're like hey man we gotta do something this is
03:19:20.16 --> 03:19:26.96 you know this is this is our family no one even knows this is a thing with the hell are we doing
03:19:28.72 --> 03:19:35.60 and at the time I'm working at a place that focuses completely on the brain
03:19:35.60 --> 03:19:47.12 I'm surrounded by neuroscience this PhD's MD's and I'm learning a lot of things that
03:19:48.80 --> 03:19:53.92 just reiterated the fact that post-managed stress, rag, brain injury these are very, very
03:19:53.92 --> 03:20:00.96 real things and I worked there for three years while 22 kills started and it basically started
03:20:00.96 --> 03:20:07.20 as an awareness movement and that's where the push-up challenge was born the 22 push-up challenge
03:20:07.92 --> 03:20:13.28 I was started by 22 kills in 2012 this was this and that went viral in 2016
03:20:14.96 --> 03:20:24.88 so you know overnight success is not a real thing and so I'm working at this center of the whole time
03:20:24.88 --> 03:20:30.64 and then there's some change up and leadership at 22 kills and I kind of found myself drifting
03:20:30.64 --> 03:20:38.88 away from the work I was doing at the center because it just wasn't it wasn't getting to the
03:20:38.88 --> 03:20:44.000 part of the soul that I wanted to be in and it wasn't getting to that like people I've been
03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:49.76 asked like how how long are you gonna speak because give the travel schedule you know it's brutal right
03:20:50.48 --> 03:20:57.20 and I thought about it for an end on second I thought okay well when I walk off a stage
03:20:57.20 --> 03:21:02.08 the first time I walk off a stage and I feel like I didn't leave a piece of my soul there
03:21:02.72 --> 03:21:08.32 that's the last time I'll do it because again it's mutually beneficial
03:21:09.84 --> 03:21:16.32 and if it's not then in your presenter you're only gonna fake it for so long
03:21:17.92 --> 03:21:22.32 people don't really that's like I feel like I ran a marathon when I'm done presenting for an hour
03:21:22.32 --> 03:21:29.52 I'm mentally physically and emotionally exhausted and if you're not you're faking it
03:21:30.88 --> 03:21:35.92 and so that's when I I left there and you know what I learned after three years
03:21:35.92 --> 03:21:39.36 or working at that place let's completely centered around the brain and the mind
03:21:40.72 --> 03:21:46.72 and it's unfortunate but essentially I learned after three years at that place I said we don't know
03:21:46.72 --> 03:21:56.56 shit about the brain that I mean again I mean I'm not gonna can't decode it it's just
03:21:56.56 --> 03:22:02.40 is what it is why do you think we're still still spending billions and billions of dollars
03:22:03.28 --> 03:22:06.24 on all this research and all these studies and trying to figure it out
03:22:07.76 --> 03:22:11.68 because we just don't understand it that's why we you know we you talk about all
03:22:11.68 --> 03:22:18.000 timeers and CTE we don't even have the technology and the imaging to recognize these things
03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:23.12 in a living human we put a man on the moon in 1969
03:22:25.92 --> 03:22:33.52 can't tell you if you have CTE wire life you know for me it's like hey let's step back and look at
03:22:33.52 --> 03:22:43.76 our priorities because one thing everyone's got is a brain everyone and the problem with the brain
03:22:43.76 --> 03:22:51.52 is there's no prosthetic for that you get the one you got and that's it why are we not
03:22:51.52 --> 03:23:00.32 hyper focused on honing this weapon that makes us who we are and so I the twins you kill
03:23:00.32 --> 03:23:06.72 approached me and said hey we would love for you to come run 22 kill we can keep the lights on for
03:23:06.72 --> 03:23:13.60 about another month and a half and you don't get health insurance and you're gonna have to take
03:23:13.60 --> 03:23:22.80 pick up I was like let me think about it absolutely yes because I want to be able to talk
03:23:22.80 --> 03:23:31.12 and share what I've been through with warriors and first responders and law enforcement
03:23:31.12 --> 03:23:37.36 officers and their families and say hey listen you see that score like that one's worth it
03:23:39.04 --> 03:23:45.20 with some over here don't do that that one's not worth it you're gonna have to fight these demons
03:23:45.20 --> 03:23:51.04 there's no way around it but you can win you just have to keep fighting
03:23:51.04 --> 03:23:56.72 because no matter what no matter where you find yourself in life you're gonna have to fight
03:23:57.68 --> 03:24:02.88 because none of us are getting up and picking out our unicorn we're just not
03:24:05.04 --> 03:24:12.56 yeah you wake up every day and it's you versus you and so that's why I was drawn to that and
03:24:12.56 --> 03:24:23.04 we had a really big first couple years I was there and not all cause I mean it's had to do
03:24:23.04 --> 03:24:27.92 with a myriad of people the people that support us the people that say one of my biggest
03:24:27.92 --> 03:24:33.84 regards was never serving and I'm like hey who told you who lied to you and said that you
03:24:33.84 --> 03:24:42.08 have to wear a uniform to be a service to your nation because you don't you don't that's
03:24:42.08 --> 03:24:48.48 a that's a misnomer I don't wear uniform anymore I mean they do you I mean they do you
03:24:49.68 --> 03:24:55.36 doesn't mean we're not serving I don't do what I do because it's easy
03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:05.28 I do it because it's hard and the employees they work for 20s who can do it because it's hard
03:25:05.28 --> 03:25:17.44 and then the face of tremendous loss they fight on that's character they're doing their
03:25:17.44 --> 03:25:23.60 dash justice because they're moving a mountain that our own government looks at and says hey
03:25:23.60 --> 03:25:29.44 pick up the corner that rug and start sweeping and look the other way and maybe it'll go away
03:25:29.44 --> 03:25:46.000 it's not going away what can people that are listening do to help the cause you know I got this
03:25:46.000 --> 03:26:00.16 kind of buddy of mine who was actually an officer in the army who's really wounded years ago and
03:26:01.44 --> 03:26:07.68 I'm gonna echo it just because he's right it's you hear all the time like I want to help
03:26:07.68 --> 03:26:16.40 I don't know right me here a lot from reverts you know I want to I want to help save the
03:26:16.40 --> 03:26:20.72 puppies that don't have a home I tell people all the time if we were trying to raise money
03:26:21.84 --> 03:26:27.92 for dogs that died back so that we'd be sitting on a billion dollars it's true I mean it's just true
03:26:28.56 --> 03:26:37.52 I mean how many dogs are screwed over a person very few right but it is what it is
03:26:37.52 --> 03:26:48.000 but if you want to wake up and you want to serve or you want to help we all have three things
03:26:48.000 --> 03:26:54.08 of value every human on this entire spin and ball of shit has three things of value
03:26:55.68 --> 03:27:02.56 time talent and treasure and if you're not willing to sacrifice some of one of those three things
03:27:02.56 --> 03:27:12.48 you're just talking that's it you're talking if you want to help start sacrificing one of those three
03:27:12.48 --> 03:27:20.56 things I don't care if it's 22 k. I don't care if it's to the humans aside I don't care
03:27:21.76 --> 03:27:31.28 sacrifice because every time we put on that uniform and our firefighters and our
03:27:31.28 --> 03:27:36.80 paramedics and our EMTs and our law enforcement officers I mean tell me if you would feel as
03:27:36.80 --> 03:27:44.40 confident as you did going to a foreign country going to hook in jab find the bad guys and kill them
03:27:45.44 --> 03:27:53.12 tell me if you would have felt as confident doing that knowing that there are people back here
03:27:53.12 --> 03:28:04.40 whom you've never met while in the kick in the door to your house while it is a blaze and save your family.
03:28:04.40 --> 03:28:09.84 I mean I think all those people every single time I do this podcast and that's exactly what I say
03:28:09.84 --> 03:28:17.92 for taking care of our home while we were gone that's absolutely and so that's why it's
03:28:17.92 --> 03:28:24.72 for me if you're not willing to sacrifice just like these men and women do on a daily basis
03:28:25.44 --> 03:28:31.36 you're talking you're talking if there's people out there that can write a check and that's enough
03:28:31.92 --> 03:28:40.08 and that's okay that's okay you're doing your part you're doing your part that's all right
03:28:40.08 --> 03:28:45.04 there are people that want to share talents there are people that say hey I want to volunteer I'm a body
03:28:45.04 --> 03:28:54.48 used me I'm here that's service that's sacrificing and we have a myriad of ways to do it and it's
03:28:55.20 --> 03:29:01.12 a beautiful thing because we're getting better and better at what we're doing because we're not
03:29:01.12 --> 03:29:08.16 doing research and studies we're implementing the things that work and we're able to tell these men
03:29:08.16 --> 03:29:14.72 and women because it's notorious in the warrior community and you're gonna know right when I said
03:29:15.76 --> 03:29:26.64 when you see a brother okay bro you good how are you I'm good okay how do we get you great
03:29:26.64 --> 03:29:40.40 because I want you great does greatness but gets greatness that's that's the living well piece
03:29:41.92 --> 03:29:47.20 and we have to do it as a tribe together I don't give a shit if you ever put a uniform on the
03:29:47.20 --> 03:29:55.28 day in your life if you're willing to stand shoulder to shoulder with people that experience trauma
03:29:55.28 --> 03:30:00.32 before the trauma and they know they've got a thing underneath of thing underneath of thing
03:30:01.04 --> 03:30:05.92 and you're willing to say hey let's go start picking up pebbles and moving them because we'll
03:30:05.92 --> 03:30:11.68 move this mountain it's gonna be long and an arduous and a painstaking process but look to your
03:30:11.68 --> 03:30:19.76 left and right that's what makes it worth it and we're doing that and we're just getting better at it
03:30:19.76 --> 03:30:27.76 and yeah it's stressful and yeah I hate fundraising and yeah I hate it but it all comes with it
03:30:27.76 --> 03:30:34.72 it comes with the territory so some people are gonna want to so what 22 kill dot com is that the best place to
03:30:34.72 --> 03:30:42.80 go look yeah go to tooncykill.com read about learn about what we're doing learn about the things that we've
03:30:42.80 --> 03:30:55.60 decided to really engage our focus on and why we're we're not just helping and treating the warrior
03:30:55.60 --> 03:31:01.76 the first father law enforcement officer it's the we want to the entire family because
03:31:03.60 --> 03:31:09.12 when you have when you pull up to the tire shop and you have four bat tires you can't you're not
03:31:09.12 --> 03:31:17.04 gonna change just one tire right you gotta change it all four we got to treat the family as a unit
03:31:18.88 --> 03:31:22.56 because I'm speaking from experience so I say we leave a big wake in our path
03:31:25.20 --> 03:31:32.64 and I would not be surprised if my family has post-match trust just from dealing with me
03:31:32.64 --> 03:31:41.44 and the sad thing is I'm not joking you know I was thinking about the nurses and doctors
03:31:41.44 --> 03:31:45.76 you left in the hospital as well as you mentioned earlier they're better people because of
03:31:45.76 --> 03:31:51.20 dealing with me so it's but I mean listen man we're and just so people note
03:31:52.08 --> 03:31:57.76 22 kill dot com they're like well don't you have to be dot org the or you know no
03:31:57.76 --> 03:32:04.96 that's you listening to the media got for bed do your own homework figured out it's
03:32:05.52 --> 03:32:10.32 you can have dot org dot com dot net doesn't matter that does not denote if you're a five
03:32:10.32 --> 03:32:18.56 or one see three or not just for the record and we have our saying it's 20 to kill and I came on
03:32:18.56 --> 03:32:25.68 I changed it to one tribe one fight because you hear all the time in the military especially one team
03:32:25.68 --> 03:32:33.04 one fight one team one fight and I was around some guys you use the we're tribe and
03:32:34.64 --> 03:32:38.08 I thought about it in the more and more I thought about it I'll speak in one time
03:32:39.60 --> 03:32:46.08 remember where I was but I went to say one team one fight but I said one tribe one fight
03:32:47.12 --> 03:32:52.32 and it's because it's too easy to be a team if you if you have the same letterhead
03:32:52.32 --> 03:33:01.84 on your business cards or you have the same insignia on your shirt that makes you a team
03:33:04.24 --> 03:33:11.12 the tribe goes way deeper than that the tribe is when my first artist put his forehead
03:33:11.12 --> 03:33:21.44 against mine it doesn't say a word yet I learned a life lesson and I get the acceptance
03:33:21.44 --> 03:33:27.04 that I was longing for without even speaking that's a tribe is driven by the same
03:33:27.04 --> 03:33:33.20 ideals the same conviction the same passion I get asked all the time like why do you think why are we
03:33:33.20 --> 03:33:39.68 still a war or I reckon I've got a saying I'll see because you can't kill your way out of an idea
03:33:42.88 --> 03:33:43.52 that's why
03:33:43.52 --> 03:33:55.84 that's what it is God forbid we call it that but just with us we so we have programs like
03:33:55.84 --> 03:34:02.08 Camp Baha'ala which is a program where we can we take up words first responders law force
03:34:02.08 --> 03:34:07.60 and officers the most in the early side of it is we're taking them up in the helicopter
03:34:07.60 --> 03:34:13.28 and taking them to kill hogs out of helicopter like as if you don't like that then you don't
03:34:13.28 --> 03:34:20.96 like freedom but we you know we also you you can take them fishing you can take them to the range
03:34:20.96 --> 03:34:27.52 we can but there it's always followed up by fireside chat that's where the money's made
03:34:29.28 --> 03:34:36.16 that's where you got to be vulnerable you'll get your adrenaline kick and then be willing to
03:34:36.16 --> 03:34:43.60 lower your wall and talk about the real shit you know then we have stay the course which is that's
03:34:43.60 --> 03:34:48.24 a traditional therapy that's the this is the you can't be holiday non-traditional stay the course
03:34:48.24 --> 03:34:52.88 is very traditional it's the one-on-one therapy with the warrior first owner his or her family
03:34:54.96 --> 03:35:02.72 and listen the reason that that was an attractive approach was because if you look back on what is
03:35:02.72 --> 03:35:08.40 the most successful outcome measures as far as therapy goes and as far as treating matters of the mind
03:35:09.52 --> 03:35:15.20 that has the best track record the one-on-one I think everyone on the spin and ballicator
03:35:15.20 --> 03:35:22.16 I should talk to professional way the least once a month every single person and I'm saying that
03:35:22.16 --> 03:35:28.08 is the guy that I would I would launch my piss bottle in the hospital that wanted to come in my room
03:35:28.08 --> 03:35:34.16 now I'm telling you right now I wish I had started that a long time ago because it would have
03:35:34.16 --> 03:35:42.72 saved me from a lot of shit I've had to do with because I let my pride win that's it I mean don't
03:35:42.72 --> 03:35:49.36 be afraid to say what it is we started a thing called the Brave Program which is women's specific
03:35:49.36 --> 03:35:59.92 because believe it or not neither sex knows everything that just don't there's power numbers but
03:36:01.44 --> 03:36:06.08 women when you break it down you break the numbers down to the bare bones they're leading the
03:36:06.08 --> 03:36:10.80 charge and everything in a negative light and that's I think it has a lot to do with there a
03:36:10.80 --> 03:36:16.56 much smaller population when it comes to the service community so there are more apt to be ice to
03:36:16.56 --> 03:36:24.72 do one self-medication isolation you know and then and they don't have nearly as big as a
03:36:24.72 --> 03:36:31.92 immediate tribe to depend on as we do because they're just way less of them and so that's that's
03:36:31.92 --> 03:36:37.92 our Brave Program and they can go do all the things that all the guys do but it's women's specific
03:36:39.04 --> 03:36:44.16 because they need to be empowered to and it's our job to help them do that without judgment
03:36:44.16 --> 03:36:50.08 and we also have the white star families program that we're building out which is basically
03:36:50.08 --> 03:36:54.08 you have the gold star families which started by the DOD well fortunately the white star families
03:36:54.08 --> 03:36:59.68 don't have a seat at that table white star families they're family family members who fall and
03:36:59.68 --> 03:37:08.32 victim to suicide and we want to give them a table they deserve a damn table as you talk to those kids
03:37:09.20 --> 03:37:12.72 they don't give a crap out of their mom or dad they just know they don't have a mom or dad
03:37:12.72 --> 03:37:21.92 that's enough for me far be it for must and I honor someone like Lewis Pooleur who the hell are we
03:37:23.76 --> 03:37:28.72 I don't give a crap what society says that the how I should feel about that
03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:34.56 it's let me tell you something this is something everyone he's known unfortunately I bet a lot of
03:37:34.56 --> 03:37:39.84 your listeners do know already so it's such just a word until it affects you personally
03:37:39.84 --> 03:37:48.24 it's just a word and I hear a lot where there's some corporations or owners of a mom and
03:37:48.24 --> 03:37:52.80 pop shop well Jake you know we would love to support you but 22 kills are pretty strong name
03:37:55.12 --> 03:38:01.36 so's cancer and AIDS it's supposed to get your attention that's the point start the conversation
03:38:03.68 --> 03:38:08.32 because you know we hear all the time knowledge is power no it's not and I'll just power when it's
03:38:08.32 --> 03:38:15.92 shared then it becomes powerful and I tell people just like it I'll tell you if you can't support us
03:38:17.28 --> 03:38:23.60 because of a name if you can't look past a name to get to the root cause of an issue consider yourself
03:38:23.60 --> 03:38:30.40 part of the problem it's that all you're doing is feeding a stigma that's killing
03:38:30.40 --> 03:38:39.76 the best men and women this nation's got to offer well I'll tell you what I think that's probably a
03:38:39.76 --> 03:38:47.44 pretty good place to wrap we've been going for a while and especially because you just
03:38:49.84 --> 03:38:56.32 made very clear the reason why I wanted to have you come on this podcast now because you know
03:38:56.32 --> 03:39:01.60 again this ties everything together that I've been talking about for the past three podcasts
03:39:03.92 --> 03:39:06.32 you know you got a guy like Lewis Polar Jr
03:39:10.88 --> 03:39:25.20 and we got to do something yeah cause it's still going on and you're out there and you're
03:39:25.20 --> 03:39:29.76 people on the front lines fighting it and you know I was watching a video that you had on your
03:39:29.76 --> 03:39:38.48 YouTube channel and it's just pictures pictures soldiers pictures of Marines pictures of service
03:39:38.48 --> 03:39:43.92 men and women and they're just coming up on the screen and it's all them you know in their
03:39:43.92 --> 03:39:56.24 uniforms and overseas and back home and and I know what each one of those pictures is
03:39:57.52 --> 03:40:04.96 and so I thank you for coming on obviously thanks for your service and thanks for everything you've
03:40:04.96 --> 03:40:10.40 done and thanks for your sacrifice and thanks for what you're doing right now
03:40:10.40 --> 03:40:25.76 well let me tell you I learned a long time ago as you're guys like us you know the mead
03:40:25.76 --> 03:40:30.48 and the knuckle dryers the odd you I'm sick of you're in the thank you shirt service
03:40:31.68 --> 03:40:35.28 you know it was impossible for me for a long time to go in the public place
03:40:35.28 --> 03:40:40.24 because if I'm wearing shorts and a t-shirt it's abundantly apparent I had a shitty day at
03:40:40.24 --> 03:40:46.16 the office somewhere along the line it was impossible for me to get anything done go buy bread and
03:40:46.16 --> 03:40:52.40 go home without someone stopping me and I hated that afternoon there yeah thank you for your
03:40:52.40 --> 03:40:58.32 service I was like man so annoying I don't want to just want to get bread and go
03:40:58.32 --> 03:41:05.12 well you'll never done on me until few years ago maybe they're doing that for them
03:41:06.96 --> 03:41:14.48 maybe it's as much for them as it is for me and then that's all about why I signed up
03:41:15.20 --> 03:41:19.84 because I it's because I thought they were worth it thought their families were worth it
03:41:20.88 --> 03:41:24.72 so I was told one time I thank you when I said you're worth it
03:41:24.72 --> 03:41:35.28 two things happened the conversation ended there and secondly they probably walked out of there
03:41:35.28 --> 03:41:41.92 a little taller than they walked in and I was like oh thanks God I get it now not about me
03:41:43.76 --> 03:41:48.72 I'll tell you just like it's all them your worth it your families worth it
03:41:50.000 --> 03:41:54.32 all you're listening is I feel the same way even though guaranteed I'm gonna have a
03:41:54.32 --> 03:41:59.92 million differences with a million different of them it worth it I do it all again tomorrow
03:42:01.20 --> 03:42:08.40 I said a bad day at the office and you know it's I just want to leave your listeners with this
03:42:08.40 --> 03:42:16.32 is that there's power just trust me when I tell you there's so much power we're about to start
03:42:16.32 --> 03:42:26.16 this thing called the tribal council which I think is gonna it's a peer to peer support group and I think I'm
03:42:26.16 --> 03:42:29.60 praying to God that it has the power behind it that I think it does
03:42:31.52 --> 03:42:35.60 where and I'm gonna leave the jars I'll be the first one to stand up on the soap box
03:42:36.56 --> 03:42:41.84 I'm just gonna open up my chest cavity pour my soul out in front of a group of people I've never met
03:42:41.84 --> 03:42:48.48 and say here's the shit I know with here's what I've been through this is what I'm doing to address
03:42:48.48 --> 03:42:57.28 it and this is how you can hold me accountable who's next there's a lot of power in that
03:42:58.80 --> 03:43:04.48 because we have to remember in our community you hear all the time be accountable to yourself be
03:43:04.48 --> 03:43:06.80 accountable to your brothers be accountable to your sisters
03:43:06.80 --> 03:43:15.44 unless you have brutal honesty first you have manufactured accountability
03:43:17.84 --> 03:43:24.88 so when I ask you how you're doing don't tell me good to appease me because I'm gonna call you on the

03:43:34.64 --> 03:43:41.20 doing because dude you're you're tip of the spirit just like anyone like you are leading the
03:43:41.20 --> 03:43:48.72 charge this wasn't easy for you to do what you had me come here to do and do when you talked about
03:43:48.72 --> 03:43:55.92 Chessie when you talked about Louis Jeir when you had me this is not the popular thing to do
03:43:58.32 --> 03:44:02.24 but you said I've never been okay with the status quo why start now
03:44:02.24 --> 03:44:08.16 so thank you for everything you've done and continue to do well I'll tell you this is
03:44:09.76 --> 03:44:13.60 it's literally an honor to be able to do this people throw that word around all the time it

03:44:17.52 --> 03:44:25.28 have had on here to be able to tell these stories that I I'm sick sometimes that they're they're
03:44:25.28 --> 03:44:32.96 not carried on and it's an honor for me to be able to pass on these stories so that people know
03:44:32.96 --> 03:44:40.72 and people can learn and it's it's a humbling experience to do it as well because being in the
03:44:40.72 --> 03:44:49.52 shadow of people like these guys people like yourself it's it's a humbling experience to be around
03:44:49.52 --> 03:44:59.44 warriors like that from all phases of history and we're gonna keep doing it and when you get
03:44:59.44 --> 03:45:05.36 that program rolling get your ass back on here we'll talk about it we'll talk about how it's going
03:45:05.36 --> 03:45:10.16 and we'll get the word out on that thing too right on also don't threaten me with a good time
03:45:12.000 --> 03:45:16.88 echo Charles yes you got a quickly quickly
03:45:16.88 --> 03:45:23.36 if anybody wants to support themselves I have a question first man I knew that was coming
03:45:23.36 --> 03:45:29.36 is that a common stereo type about Navy seals they got to go tanning they need the cool
03:45:29.36 --> 03:45:36.72 sunglasses they mean nice hair not really jockel though you don't go tanning no no the stereo
03:45:36.72 --> 03:45:44.08 typical seal thing was something that I didn't like you know I didn't like it and the
03:45:44.08 --> 03:45:52.000 older I got the more I disliked it and it's you know but it's a reality of you know
03:45:52.000 --> 03:45:58.64 especially during that during the 80s 90s for all the 80s 90s were the reputation but you know
03:45:58.64 --> 03:46:04.08 the guys in Vietnam too man those guys like like in Vietnam they wore blue jeans in the field
03:46:04.08 --> 03:46:08.40 they you know because they kept off leeches and they were tougher but then you know guess what
03:46:08.40 --> 03:46:14.40 that turns into like something where guys at some guy in 1992 is wearing blue jeans with his
03:46:14.40 --> 03:46:20.000 candies and it's like oh no he's the new that bro now where I show up at the teams it was like hey
03:46:20.000 --> 03:46:26.32 we you know I want to have long hair and be like a cool guy we you did oh yeah yeah for sure
03:46:26.32 --> 03:46:32.40 there's somebody just put a picture out on the interwebs of me with long hair like circa 1991
03:46:32.40 --> 03:46:38.72 yeah yeah the long side burns and everything because I wanted to be joke cool and but what happened
03:46:38.72 --> 03:46:44.24 was well number one the war started number two I started working really closely with conventional
03:46:44.24 --> 03:46:49.52 forces on my first deployment a little bit on my second deployment ton also I did multiple
03:46:49.52 --> 03:46:56.08 shipboard deployments where I worked with Marines very closely even when I was young and yeah so I
03:46:56.08 --> 03:47:03.44 just it was one of those things that like when I would hear it at first I would be like oh that's
03:47:03.44 --> 03:47:07.92 no big deal but then what I realized was it was a real thing when you when you were in the stereotype
03:47:07.92 --> 03:47:14.40 as I moved into leadership positions and I would hear that stereotype I realized it was a real thing
03:47:14.40 --> 03:47:19.60 and that that real thing wasn't it wasn't funny it wasn't funny because when you when you
03:47:19.60 --> 03:47:26.000 eat a meta a Marine Corps battalion commander and you have long hair your uniform doesn't look right or you
03:47:26.000 --> 03:47:33.36 meet an army battalion commander or an army brigade commander or a senior or a gunney sergeant
03:47:34.16 --> 03:47:39.44 or a company first sergeant when you meet one of them somebody that's been in the Marine Corps for
03:47:39.44 --> 03:47:46.40 23 years and you can't put on and blouse your your pants and your boots it doesn't matter how good
03:47:46.40 --> 03:47:50.48 you are in the field they're looking at you and thinking oh this guy can't even blouse boots I don't
03:47:50.48 --> 03:47:58.32 want him around that's so that stereotype even though it had definitely was rooted in truth like
03:47:58.32 --> 03:48:01.84 hey man when we got to her body everyone had shape heads everyone had square away uniforms didn't
03:48:01.84 --> 03:48:06.32 allow patches we talked about them before you know we we had guys like if we could we put a whole
03:48:06.32 --> 03:48:13.84 element in army camouflage uniform so ace use they just look like army sir yeah so I was against it
03:48:13.84 --> 03:48:19.20 but I get the humor of it and I have you know I don't take anything that personally thanks
03:48:19.20 --> 03:48:25.44 so okay so it's a stereotype like in at work can I thought he meant maybe like out at the club
03:48:25.44 --> 03:48:30.000 or whatever like you know need seals tend to be more into you know what's funny is you know
03:48:30.000 --> 03:48:34.32 who made a joke about this Tim Kennedy we were here we were recording the podcast
03:48:34.32 --> 03:48:40.96 Tim Kennedy was literally doing a photo shoot and he was like he's got long hair and he was like
03:48:40.96 --> 03:48:47.12 oh you know I'm not like Hollywood seal and I was like dang dude I don't have hair yeah
03:48:47.12 --> 03:48:54.24 yeah I'll tell you why let me give it give you the the Barney version of everything he just said
03:48:54.24 --> 03:48:58.88 this is one of the things I dig about jocca and it has nothing to do with this following
03:48:58.88 --> 03:49:07.04 or what he did it's because because he he's authentic and he's intentional and everything that he
03:49:07.04 --> 03:49:17.52 does and we should long to be around that a lot more yep I'm gonna have to go ahead and agree
03:49:17.52 --> 03:49:24.08 with you on that one so that's when you sort of learned hey hairs just to look good this is
03:49:24.08 --> 03:49:29.92 after you shave your head by the way yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure does it mean anything else
03:49:29.92 --> 03:49:35.68 I'm here to win yeah but that's that was that was me growing up in the teams yeah yeah you know
03:49:35.68 --> 03:49:41.92 that's why Tim Kennedy was gonna hear this I was making fun of making fun of my well he was
03:49:41.92 --> 03:49:48.16 making fun of my uh people yeah yeah your people of the above my people having long hair but he had
03:49:48.16 --> 03:49:53.76 long hair and doing a photo shoot you know who said that you know Matt Baster at Matt Baster
03:49:53.76 --> 03:49:59.20 on one of his videos he's he he he alluded to that oh it's no it's real yeah it's a real no and
03:49:59.20 --> 03:50:04.32 it's a real thing and Tim Kennedy is a hundred percent right seal because because yeah there's
03:50:04.32 --> 03:50:11.12 there's some seals where you're like oh I know 100 percent let me tell you one thing I I I just
03:50:11.12 --> 03:50:21.84 object to in in a real strong way somebody using some kind of hair product right like that's no
03:50:21.84 --> 03:50:26.64 that's a no more than tanning that's a no oh no one actually tan so that's not a real thing
03:50:26.64 --> 03:50:33.60 oh it's a real thing I was on the I was on the I was on the org and the nineties and there was the
03:50:33.60 --> 03:50:41.92 there's the marine recon guys and they straight up had the foil like reflectors under their
03:50:41.92 --> 03:50:46.40 chin's out when they were sun tanning I got to kick out of that but it doesn't matter it doesn't
03:50:46.40 --> 03:50:54.08 matter if they that there was a dozen recon marines out in in speedos straight up tanning with baby oil
03:50:54.08 --> 03:50:58.96 it doesn't matter the reality was the seals were the voluauly would tanning guys that's the
03:50:58.96 --> 03:51:04.16 way it is that's okay that's what you got to do at the same time bro to though it'll be very clear
03:51:05.20 --> 03:51:14.16 that it's me'd saying it or Tim Kennedy or Matt or okay that's one thing okay
03:51:14.88 --> 03:51:23.12 but if like if Joe public civilian says something that's like hey bro yeah yeah
03:51:23.12 --> 03:51:30.32 I don't know that Joe public would actually know that yeah that's what we roll out oh if we
03:51:30.32 --> 03:51:38.72 rolled out all the stereotypes for the services like marines dumb jarhead uh crayon the crayon thing
03:51:38.72 --> 03:51:44.96 that's the big marine core one what crayon crayon either yeah crayons that's like legit thing
03:51:44.96 --> 03:51:50.48 the the army's got there you know who the things and you know we don't have that kind of
03:51:50.48 --> 03:51:57.04 all that kind of thing going on uh green braise you know smoking cigarettes you know that's what
03:51:57.04 --> 03:52:01.20 the seals would say like oh yeah they're over there smoking cigarettes and even donuts you know so
03:52:01.84 --> 03:52:09.28 it's just little stereotypes that have some some bases of reality but you know you can't put
03:52:09.28 --> 03:52:12.96 a stir so that's why stereotypes are stereotypes there's some levels of reality to it but
03:52:12.96 --> 03:52:19.76 they're the reality so you can't blank in a whole organization with any of those so that's the way it
03:52:19.76 --> 03:52:26.08 goes all right bro next time you go tanning you're gonna walk you solid the jocca will
03:52:26.08 --> 03:52:32.40 tan it all right well there it is we cleared that up thank you for that of course here

03:54:27.68 --> 03:54:36.16 out it's new flavor one of the flavors yeah what are flavors is it's I don't know if this is okay
03:54:36.16 --> 03:54:40.96 right we might have to rebrand it something else because it can't be jocco if it is
03:54:42.16 --> 03:54:49.68 coconut pineapple here it's tasty okay so here's what I can't believe it so anyway so jocco's
03:54:49.68 --> 03:54:56.40 hardcore right authentic authentic hardcore right it's good okay so one of the main
03:54:57.76 --> 03:55:02.88 important issues with developing these supplements which are good supplements by the way
03:55:02.88 --> 03:55:09.20 is taste is that hardcore does that seem hardcore do you he thinks that I would like
03:55:09.20 --> 03:55:14.80 when I originally was making supplements he thought that that my I would have no priority on taste like
03:55:14.80 --> 03:55:18.16 if it tastes bad doesn't matter right does it suck it it's actually better if it tastes
03:55:18.16 --> 03:55:23.60 to that false that counter okay I wasn't thinking but you could think that again that I
03:55:23.60 --> 03:55:26.80 didn't know what in order to drink this you could just gotta get like you just gotta
03:55:26.80 --> 03:55:30.56 grit your teeth and get song potentially like hey if that happens it happens kind of like if
03:55:30.56 --> 03:55:33.44 it's not like if it's not like I don't feel that way because the reality is when
03:55:33.44 --> 03:55:38.72 supplements taste like crap you don't eat it so then what's the point yeah so there you go
03:55:38.72 --> 03:55:43.20 the flank that's what he did that's what that is the flank with the taste nonetheless
03:55:43.20 --> 03:55:49.28 taste good and I think peanut collada pineapple coconut whatever I think that's a good idea
03:55:50.000 --> 03:55:57.12 hey how much to our whole way root yes oh my people in Hawaii yes and most by the way is
03:55:57.12 --> 03:56:02.56 mint chocolate chip yeah mint chocolate there's no chips there's no chips good point
03:56:02.56 --> 03:56:09.60 same kind of feel I've never heard without chips kind of terrible for a little bit tough to deal
03:56:09.60 --> 03:56:16.24 way yeah it will taste good though we can we can run that yeah reports are in good
03:56:16.88 --> 03:56:22.16 very good also oh I hear good things about the mixability too right now oh just that's a big deal

03:58:46.80 --> 03:58:52.64 I don't have a problem with that that's not happening well yeah you're kind of anti-advertisements
03:58:52.64 --> 03:58:56.96 as far as advertisements go yeah even like on you you know how when you watch youtube video
03:58:56.96 --> 03:59:04.72 you can add in the in the beginning of the video I have youtube read do you have youtube read too
03:59:04.72 --> 03:59:10.48 $999 a month you can spend you press click and it just starts playing the video no advertisement
03:59:10.48 --> 03:59:15.20 here's the thing I don't mind the advertisements that's how I find out about like a bunch of
03:59:15.20 --> 03:59:20.16 the new music come out a lot of like um like you know intermittent this fast thing weird
03:59:20.16 --> 03:59:24.08 I had a guy the other day he was like I was watching he was watching one of the podcasts
03:59:24.08 --> 03:59:29.52 and it was one of heavy podcasts which I guess doesn't really narrow it down too much but
03:59:29.52 --> 03:59:33.44 he's he goes walking the podcast and all of a sudden there's a big advertisement on you know what
03:59:33.44 --> 03:59:38.80 and this is what youtube will do sometimes with longer videos they'll just put that over as far as angry
03:59:39.44 --> 03:59:44.32 and you know what it was in youtube comments which we know we don't respond to but we do read
03:59:45.04 --> 03:59:52.40 but I almost responded bro 99 99 that thing's gone yeah I was watching
03:59:52.40 --> 04:00:00.56 that's some serious for a full chat right there is bro it is he's it is he's he's he's he's he's
04:00:00.56 --> 04:00:05.60 but it was going great and then the commercial popped out was starting to check into my life I'm never
04:00:05.60 --> 04:00:14.000 going to park again man I think I think the ads I get it though you know because sometimes you
04:00:14.000 --> 04:00:18.40 leave your listening to his deal his thing whatever it is he's talking about it takes you mentally
04:00:18.40 --> 04:00:23.92 and kind of emotionally this face it emotionally into a certain spot and then it fades out into
04:00:23.92 --> 04:00:28.32 some hey do you want to I don't know whatever the ad is you know you want to get more kind of
04:00:28.32 --> 04:00:34.64 put some breaks on that there's been some of my new little things in the podcast especially for
04:00:34.64 --> 04:00:39.84 echo I'll say echo's been very and we didn't talk about it because it was actually not the right
04:00:39.84 --> 04:00:45.76 time to talk about it but on the last podcast 122 there was an emotional moment for echo
04:00:45.76 --> 04:00:52.24 and you got through it I know I know I'm like super hardcore and everyone knows that you know but
04:00:52.24 --> 04:00:58.56 hey man you know even stronger moments of fatigue no one I was maybe just fatigue that time anyway
04:00:59.36 --> 04:01:06.80 good or ways to support is subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already on iTunes Stitcher google play
04:01:08.24 --> 04:01:13.04 in any other place where be you listen to your podcast new podcast apps all over now
04:01:13.04 --> 04:01:18.24 so boom subscribe no shame can't keep up on them yeah and when I say no shame that's not a
04:01:18.24 --> 04:01:22.08 in white or actually here's something a little interesting thing start super interesting it's kind
04:01:22.08 --> 04:01:27.76 of interesting you know the expression no shame right it usually means like by this guy has no shame
04:01:27.76 --> 04:01:32.88 like he's kind of like he's he has his moral standards maybe kind of low something like that right
04:01:32.88 --> 04:01:40.32 in white no shame means don't be shy so like in South Africa when I was in South Africa they say
04:01:40.32 --> 04:01:45.20 shame it's just a word that they use for all kinds of different things and they're not shame
04:01:45.84 --> 04:01:50.40 okay yeah it's it's I like the way they used it interesting yeah and I'll try and bring it back
04:01:51.20 --> 04:01:55.92 yeah I'm telling you right now with those two pieces of information right I'm prepared to change
04:01:57.28 --> 04:02:01.68 you know it'll help me in case you get a guy from white he says no shame he will he doesn't
04:02:01.68 --> 04:02:05.84 mean it in a bad way because it's they're very subtle differences but one is kind of on the bad
04:02:05.84 --> 04:02:10.48 side like oh this guy no shame you know this guy no shame if a whole guy from white says no shame
04:02:10.48 --> 04:02:15.92 is he's just saying don't be shy or if he's telling the story say a this person wasn't shy at that
04:02:15.92 --> 04:02:22.000 point like like if he says and here it is here's the example okay I'm telling the story about a guy
04:02:22.000 --> 04:02:27.36 who went and talked to a girl and said this guy no shame he just went and talked to her on the
04:02:27.36 --> 04:02:31.52 mainland or you know outside of white whatever they'd be like wait what was wrong with it was
04:02:31.52 --> 04:02:35.04 that his friends girlfriend or something what was that his cousin or something you know I mean
04:02:35.04 --> 04:02:39.68 so it sounds like a whole different story so he can do that on in text message there then
04:02:40.24 --> 04:02:46.72 if it's a white guy you can more people say problems yeah well well when you may not know
04:02:46.72 --> 04:02:54.40 the point the if he could probably do it because he is very proactive and aggressive in his use of
04:02:54.40 --> 04:03:02.48 emojis this guy yeah rainbows shockers like we've all he brings it yeah I incorporate the palm
04:03:02.48 --> 04:03:07.68 tree too very recently so watch out for them yes nonetheless back to support

04:05:30.32 --> 04:05:35.12 I'm gonna sleep in whatever whatever the weakness is there's a track for it and it's jaco telling
04:05:35.12 --> 04:05:39.36 you why you shouldn't give into that weakness just for that time it's not him yelling nothing like
04:05:39.36 --> 04:05:44.000 that it's just kind of explained to you why you shouldn't shouldn't give in it's real effective
04:05:44.000 --> 04:05:49.84 do by the 100% effective I'm not mistaken that was the last the miracle report percentage was
04:05:49.84 --> 04:05:57.20 sure well you know you just mentioned very quickly the warrior kid podcast and that has a
04:05:57.20 --> 04:06:02.56 youtube channel and in order to have a youtube channel for the warrior kid podcast there has to be a
04:06:02.56 --> 04:06:10.48 warrior kid podcast which there is now warrior kid podcast is out and in it it is questions
04:06:10.48 --> 04:06:18.88 for uncle jake by the way not this uncle jake put a different uncle jake seven and it's on a separate
04:06:18.88 --> 04:06:24.40 channel the reason I put it on a separate channel is so that your kids aren't sitting there streaming
04:06:24.40 --> 04:06:31.12 podcasts or your kid podcast and all of a sudden they jump into the shitty season yeah
04:06:31.12 --> 04:06:37.60 or the mela masquer so it's totally separate channel uncle jakes got some lessons learned for kids
04:06:37.60 --> 04:06:45.68 yes definitely for parents very true 100% common for macotrials for teachers yes coaches yes
04:06:45.68 --> 04:06:50.48 human beings i'm gonna go ahead and say yes real quick about the what i was thinking too well
04:06:50.48 --> 04:06:56.72 listen into where it's okay this is why it's for like a parent because these kids
04:06:57.36 --> 04:07:01.44 like that ask you the questions they're questions they probably ask their parents yeah
04:07:01.44 --> 04:07:05.52 you seem to have maybe the parents would be like oh I'm not sure yeah maybe or okay i'll just kind
04:07:05.52 --> 04:07:10.72 of it's spontaneously answered the question meanwhile it's like kind of your is good man it's good
04:07:10.72 --> 04:07:15.68 it's getting out they know like one you know that happens to be number one number one
04:07:16.80 --> 04:07:23.12 kids podcast kids and family podcast so that's cool all right speaking of way the warrior kid
04:07:24.000 --> 04:07:29.44 there's the book way of the warrior kid and there's also the new book boom there it is hardcover
04:07:29.44 --> 04:07:35.92 way the warrior kid to marks mission uncle jake continues to help mark with some of his
04:07:35.92 --> 04:07:41.28 problems losing his temper how to handle being made fun of don't you wish somebody told you
04:07:41.28 --> 04:07:47.36 how to handle being made fun of yeah your kid i know i would have liked that fear of failure how
04:07:47.36 --> 04:07:51.60 do you overcome that also learns about the value of money a lot of people don't know that these
04:07:51.60 --> 04:07:56.64 days a lot of kids don't know that for sure mark in the book actually gets a job
04:07:56.64 --> 04:08:05.52 makes money refurbishes a bike basically gets after it so give the children that you know
04:08:06.08 --> 04:08:11.44 the ultimate gift and that is the gift of discipline shown the way the warrior kid and you will be
04:08:11.44 --> 04:08:17.44 stoked speaking of warrior kids and so put you mentioned earlier yeah you could get from on it you could
