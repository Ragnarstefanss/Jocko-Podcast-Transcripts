00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.52
This is Jockel Podcast number 106 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening,

2
00:00:07.52 --> 00:00:20.32
I go. Good evening. Now in podcast 105, we finished just as the 17 cab flew out of the

3
00:00:20.32 --> 00:00:31.60
hydrangea valley after keeping it together during a vicious three day fight where they suffered

4
00:00:31.60 --> 00:00:38.88
some massive casualties 79 killed an action, 121 wounded and on top of that the battle

5
00:00:38.88 --> 00:00:46.16
field was littered with enemy dead with the estimates of enemy dead to be between 500 and

6
00:00:46.16 --> 00:00:53.20
1000 and we stopped there where the 17 cab left the battlefield so if you haven't listened to

7
00:00:53.20 --> 00:01:04.56
105 yet go back and listen to that before continuing with this podcast 106 because even though

8
00:01:04.56 --> 00:01:11.36
the 17 left the battlefield the battle wasn't over yet and one of the events that I didn't

9
00:01:11.36 --> 00:01:19.28
really talk about in the first hydrangea podcast on 105 was the fact that two other battalions

10
00:01:19.84 --> 00:01:27.36
had arrived on the ground to reinforce the 17 and it was the second battalion fifth cavalry

11
00:01:28.16 --> 00:01:36.08
commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Tully and the second battalion seventh cavalry led by Lieutenant

12
00:01:36.08 --> 00:01:46.48
Colonel Robert McDade. Now most of the battalions men from those two battalions had landed

13
00:01:46.48 --> 00:01:54.000
at LZ Victor which was about two miles away from X-ray and they had patrolled to X-ray on foot

14
00:01:54.96 --> 00:02:00.32
arriving for the most part without incident and then things seemed to settle down or a lot

15
00:02:00.32 --> 00:02:07.76
of next-ray one seven left and once one seven had left the battlefield two seven and two five

16
00:02:07.76 --> 00:02:17.36
were still there so at that point that portion of the battle was over and two seven and two five

17
00:02:17.36 --> 00:02:24.96
could have likely been extracted via helicopter pretty securely just at one seven had been

18
00:02:24.96 --> 00:02:33.92
it seems that general west moorland did not like the idea of two seven and two five pulling out

19
00:02:35.12 --> 00:02:42.24
he thought that that would appear as a retreat so he ordered that two five and two seven

20
00:02:42.24 --> 00:02:49.52
secure LZ X-ray for the night and then the next day they would move by foot patrol to another LZ

21
00:02:49.52 --> 00:02:57.52
called LZ Albany which was about two point five miles to the north and then B-50-U bombers were

22
00:02:57.52 --> 00:03:06.40
going to rain down bombs on LZ X-ray and the surrounding areas they didn't expect a lot of resistance

23
00:03:06.40 --> 00:03:13.20
because things had settled somewhat down so much on LZ X-ray that if you remember even towards the

24
00:03:13.20 --> 00:03:17.52
end of the last podcast there was reporters came in and landed in LZ X-ray and were doing

25
00:03:17.52 --> 00:03:24.24
camera shots and interviewing people so it was pretty settled down they felt like it was over

26
00:03:24.24 --> 00:03:31.12
and they didn't expect much resistance on this movement from LZ X-ray to LZ Albany

27
00:03:34.24 --> 00:03:40.64
so let's go back to the book the book is We Were Soldiers once and Young by General Halmore and Joe

28
00:03:40.64 --> 00:03:48.48
Galaway and like I said there wasn't much resistance expected and here's what it says in the book

29
00:03:48.48 --> 00:03:53.20
the word among Bob McDades troopers was that it was going to be a walk in the sun

30
00:03:54.24 --> 00:03:59.04
a stroll over to another landing zone where the helicopters would come in and extract them the first

31
00:03:59.04 --> 00:04:10.32
leg of the journey home to on K-Base the word was wrong

32
00:04:13.84 --> 00:04:18.88
and these guys even though there hadn't been much fighting going on they were actually a little bit

33
00:04:18.88 --> 00:04:24.72
tired because they had been awake on the ground so here we go just before Alpha Company second

34
00:04:24.72 --> 00:04:35.52
battalion moved out it's commander captain Joe Sadini's put out an unusual order his executive officer

35
00:04:35.52 --> 00:04:40.40
Lieutenant Larry Gwyn who we're going to let hear a lot from Lieutenant Larry Gwyn remembers it well

36
00:04:40.40 --> 00:04:46.64
the company had been on 100% alert for over 52 hours we were in such a state of exhaustion

37
00:04:46.64 --> 00:04:54.88
that captain Sadini's directed that each man take two APC tablets aspirin with caffeine a move

38
00:04:54.88 --> 00:05:00.64
designed to increase the mental alertness of the troops so there you go take a little caffeine

39
00:05:00.64 --> 00:05:04.56
little aspirin get you guys get your heads in the game because they've been awake for a long

40
00:05:04.56 --> 00:05:09.28
time and again they're not expecting much but they still put on the ground you know hop LZ for a while

41
00:05:09.28 --> 00:05:16.72
back to the book Lieutenant Ali the battalion's communication officer was with headquarters company

42
00:05:16.72 --> 00:05:21.44
we were told that this would be a tactical move there was a lot of stuff on the battlefield equipment

43
00:05:21.44 --> 00:05:27.12
supplies captured stuff that had to be police to up and blown up all in a hurry up situation

44
00:05:27.68 --> 00:05:35.28
I was personally carrying an RC-292 antenna in addition to my regular combat load I weighed about

45
00:05:35.28 --> 00:05:43.04
140 pounds my normal combat load was 40 or 50 pounds the 2 9 2 and 10 away 60 pounds

46
00:05:43.84 --> 00:05:49.52
the temperature must have been 96 and the humidity was the same we were moving as fast as we could

47
00:05:49.52 --> 00:05:57.20
through the elephant grass and scrub oaks some high canopy we were humping everyone was as tired as could be

48
00:05:57.20 --> 00:06:03.36
so we're already in a rough situation we've been on the ground for 52 hours and we're going to move

49
00:06:05.28 --> 00:06:09.28
two and a half miles doesn't sound very far but when you're carrying so he's already

50
00:06:09.28 --> 00:06:12.96
he's carrying a hundred pounds it's 40 and 50 pound combat load plus his antenna and everyone else is

51
00:06:12.96 --> 00:06:18.96
carrying all kinds of extra stuff that they're pulling off the LZ it's 96 degrees out 96%

52
00:06:18.96 --> 00:06:23.60
humidity and walking through the jungle is never easy it's up and down little terrain features

53
00:06:23.60 --> 00:06:32.16
going through various foliage is hard so this is not easy not the biggest guy too by the

54
00:06:32.16 --> 00:06:37.92
140 150 pounds which guys were smaller back then yeah but still they are now bar pal yeah no

55
00:06:37.92 --> 00:06:44.96
100 pounds that's that's no joke that's no joke back to the book lieutenant Gary Gwyn of Alpha

56
00:06:44.96 --> 00:06:51.20
company says the jungle around us got heavier and heavier that's when things got a little scary

57
00:06:51.20 --> 00:06:57.36
there was a sudden absence of any air cover the guys were silent and I wondered where our

58
00:06:57.36 --> 00:07:03.36
helos and our aerial rocket artillery ships were we had not changed formation tactically

59
00:07:03.36 --> 00:07:08.48
but physically we had to move in much tighter to maintain visual contact because of the undergrowth

60
00:07:09.36 --> 00:07:14.64
the terrain forced our flaker flankers in so at this point they're they they had a bunch of

61
00:07:14.64 --> 00:07:19.92
air cover they don't have any air cover right now and now the terrain is making them get closer

62
00:07:19.92 --> 00:07:26.000
and closer together because if you and I are on patrol I don't I want to keep you in visual range

63
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.72
I want to be able to see you and so if all the sun there's elephant grass will the only way to

64
00:07:30.72 --> 00:07:34.56
to keep visual of use for you to get close to me and for immediate close to the next guy and so

65
00:07:34.56 --> 00:07:38.40
everyone starts compressing he's talking about the flankers being out there a lot of times when

66
00:07:38.40 --> 00:07:44.32
we patrol in formation you'll put people out on the flanks with individual range but that'll be

67
00:07:44.32 --> 00:07:48.48
stretching the visual range but they're out there to make sure that there's no one sneaking up on you

68
00:07:48.48 --> 00:07:54.08
and so they've that it's getting dense now to the point where they can't keep their flankers out so now

69
00:07:54.08 --> 00:08:00.96
you're losing some of that flank security back to the book Gwen says alpha companies column order

70
00:08:00.96 --> 00:08:06.96
integrity had been good until two prisoners were captured and everything came to a sudden halt

71
00:08:08.72 --> 00:08:15.28
when I arrived so genies so genies was interrogating the two they were mint condition

72
00:08:15.28 --> 00:08:22.96
new weapons grenades new gear but both were feverish terrified and shaking none of us in

73
00:08:22.96 --> 00:08:28.32
company headquarters had seen alive north Vietnamese up close these were not the last we would see

74
00:08:28.32 --> 00:08:33.36
this day we gave them water and advised the battalion headquarters so all of a sudden they got a

75
00:08:33.36 --> 00:08:39.12
couple of prisoners little scary to me when the prisoners that we take have brand new weapons

76
00:08:39.12 --> 00:08:44.64
new grenades new gear I mean we at least know that they're fresh maybe they're not combat hardened

77
00:08:44.64 --> 00:08:48.88
but we know that they've got some good well supplied which is a scary thing in this type of war

78
00:08:52.16 --> 00:09:00.000
so this is this is kind of weird looking back hindsight of course being 2020 this is this is an

79
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.96
error or a or a mistake that gets made right now and of course mistakes happen all the time

80
00:09:06.96 --> 00:09:12.56
and they they don't get capitalized on by the enemy sometimes by luck sometimes by skill of the enemy

81
00:09:12.56 --> 00:09:18.80
this is one of those mistakes that it gets capitalized again whether it's by luck or plan

82
00:09:18.80 --> 00:09:23.84
probably by luck maybe it's a little bit of both you wouldn't think much of it if things didn't

83
00:09:23.84 --> 00:09:26.96
go the way they did you know late late for now you stabbed this conversation a lot I mean

84
00:09:27.68 --> 00:09:32.72
you don't know when things are going to go wrong and and seriously you can be on the battlefield

85
00:09:33.28 --> 00:09:38.48
and you can you can say hey everyone go left and everyone goes left and everything turns out great

86
00:09:38.48 --> 00:09:42.96
or you can say everyone go right and everyone go right and everyone thing turns out great

87
00:09:43.52 --> 00:09:47.76
if you go left then you happen to go to where the enemy was waiting in ambush for you to go

88
00:09:48.40 --> 00:09:52.72
now you're you just made a bad tactical call the thing that made it a bad tactical calls that the

89
00:09:52.72 --> 00:09:57.84
enemy happened to be there you couldn't know that and if you'd been if you'd said go right

90
00:09:57.84 --> 00:10:01.60
well you'd great made the greatest call ever because the enemy was over there waiting for again

91
00:10:01.60 --> 00:10:05.92
you don't know where the enemy's gonna be don't have that luxury so sometimes you make the best

92
00:10:05.92 --> 00:10:11.28
tactical decision you can make and it turns out bad now we can look back at this hindsight being 2020

93
00:10:11.28 --> 00:10:17.76
of course and and critique what's about to happen so we'll we'll we'll talk a little bit more about it

94
00:10:17.76 --> 00:10:21.68
here's what goes down back to the book Captain George Forest commander of Alpha Company first

95
00:10:21.68 --> 00:10:26.96
baton fifth cavalry was more than 500 yards to the rear so these guys are in a long column of

96
00:10:26.96 --> 00:10:28.96
march group of people

97
00:10:28.96 --> 00:10:35.44
middaydast all the company commanders to come forward so middaydast the company is the baton

98
00:10:35.44 --> 00:10:40.000
commander he tells all the companies commanders to come forward so he's middayd's up at the

99
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.16
front of this column and who knows how big they are you know he says he's 500 yards the rear of this

100
00:10:44.16 --> 00:10:51.60
whole thing probably spanned out probably six 700 maybe even 800 meters we're getting close to a

101
00:10:51.60 --> 00:11:00.40
kilometer in length of people to spread out just so everyone understands it's hard to control 40

102
00:11:00.40 --> 00:11:08.32
guys in a in a line of march with any kind of control that spread out over 200 meters that's challenging

103
00:11:08.32 --> 00:11:16.72
you get 500 600 guys spread out over almost a kilometer we have a serious command and control issue

104
00:11:16.72 --> 00:11:21.20
so now what he's doing to overcome this issue is telling all the all the company commanders so

105
00:11:21.20 --> 00:11:26.000
there's three companies that are out there actually there's more than that but there's multiple

106
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.80
companies out there he tells all the company commanders hey come to my position at the front of

107
00:11:30.80 --> 00:11:36.88
this thing so we can talk about what's happening back to the book Captain Fezmire the Charlie

108
00:11:36.88 --> 00:11:43.28
Company commander was also moving up the count column to toward McDades position with him or his

109
00:11:43.28 --> 00:11:49.36
two radio operators his artillery his artillery forward exor observer lieutenant Sidney Smith

110
00:11:49.36 --> 00:11:56.96
and his radio men as well as fur first sergeant Franklin Hans so so I want you to think about that

111
00:11:56.96 --> 00:12:01.76
or let me explain this to you a little bit more here's the Charlie Company commander he's moving

112
00:12:01.76 --> 00:12:09.20
forth so he's leaving his company and with him he brings his two radio operators so who does that

113
00:12:09.20 --> 00:12:15.28
leave with the company there might be one paltoon guy left that's a radio operator maybe one

114
00:12:15.28 --> 00:12:22.64
an each paltoon but there there's he's pulling the the communications node out of the company

115
00:12:22.64 --> 00:12:27.36
right there he brings forward his artillery observer so this is the guy that's going to be

116
00:12:27.36 --> 00:12:32.72
able to place artillery other guys can pick up the slack but not as well as this guy can do it

117
00:12:34.72 --> 00:12:39.92
he brings lieutenant Sidney Smith and his radio men so that means that so sorry the the artillery

118
00:12:39.92 --> 00:12:44.72
observer is lieutenant Sidney Smith but that guy brings his radio men as well so there's another guy

119
00:12:44.72 --> 00:12:50.16
out of the loop and then the first sergeant the company first sergeant so now that's the leadership

120
00:12:50.16 --> 00:12:55.20
the company leadership is now from from Charlie Company is now gone they're moving up forward to talk

121
00:12:55.20 --> 00:13:03.76
about it and so here they give a kind of an overview of what's going on here it is this is

122
00:13:03.76 --> 00:13:09.84
what back to the book this is what was happening Sudanese alphar company was moving forward toward

123
00:13:09.84 --> 00:13:14.80
the albany clearing so they've they've now a pro they're kind of approached this this LZ Albany that's

124
00:13:14.80 --> 00:13:20.88
what they're talking about the albany clearing um alphar company the sygini's alphar company was

125
00:13:20.88 --> 00:13:26.08
moving toward the albany clearing Colonel McDade and his batain command group were with alphar company

126
00:13:26.88 --> 00:13:32.08
the other company commanders had left their companies under orders and were moving up to

127
00:13:32.08 --> 00:13:38.08
join McDade for a conference so the other company commanders are not with their companies anymore

128
00:13:38.08 --> 00:13:44.40
the batain was strong out along the line of march for a distance of at least 550 yards so half a

129
00:13:44.40 --> 00:13:51.20
kilometer the men of delta company were lulling around on the ground Charlie company had flankers

130
00:13:51.20 --> 00:13:57.04
off to each side but were mostly taking a break sitting or lying down George forus men at the tail

131
00:13:57.04 --> 00:14:02.56
of the column were in a wedge formation and also had flank security posted the men of batain were

132
00:14:02.56 --> 00:14:07.76
worn out after nearly 60 hours without sleep and four hours of marching through difficult terrain

133
00:14:08.80 --> 00:14:13.20
visibility in the chest high elephant grass was very limited

134
00:14:16.96 --> 00:14:24.64
that situation to be in here's lieutenant going talking we had been there a short time five minutes

135
00:14:24.64 --> 00:14:28.96
when i heard some rounds fired near our first platoon i thought they must have caught up with

136
00:14:28.96 --> 00:14:36.96
those NVA stragglers then everything opened up opened up the firing just crescendoed they hadn't

137
00:14:36.96 --> 00:14:42.16
found the stragglers they had run right into the north Vietnamese i was out in the grass away from

138
00:14:42.16 --> 00:14:47.28
the trees when it started the rounds were so fast and for years overhead they were knocking bark

139
00:14:47.28 --> 00:14:53.68
off the trees i ran to them one round struck the tree i was crouch next to and inch over my head i

140
00:14:53.68 --> 00:15:00.24
said holy shit and ran to join Joel we all got down then i heard the sickening whump of mortar fire

141
00:15:00.24 --> 00:15:08.88
landing where i had seen our second platoon disappear the most savage one day battle of the

142
00:15:08.88 --> 00:15:15.68
Vietnam war had just begun the second battalion seventh cavalry had walked into a hornet's nest

143
00:15:15.68 --> 00:15:24.32
the north Vietnamese reserve force the 550 man eight battalion 66 regimen had been bivouacct in the

144
00:15:24.32 --> 00:15:31.20
woods off to the northeast of nicknades column so you've got fresh soldiers that had been waiting

145
00:15:31.20 --> 00:15:37.60
they were the reserves that whole earlier battle in the hydrang with the one seven calf this this

146
00:15:37.60 --> 00:15:43.52
Vietnamese group the 66 regimen eight battalion 66 regimen had been waiting in reserve

147
00:15:43.52 --> 00:15:50.32
and now they just so happened to be in the line of march where these uh where the two five is coming

148
00:15:50.32 --> 00:16:00.48
through or sorry the two seven is coming through here's what Colonel Anne who again this was the

149
00:16:00.48 --> 00:16:06.16
Vietnamese commander here's what he had to say i think this fight of November 17th was the most

150
00:16:06.16 --> 00:16:12.32
important of the entire campaign i gave the order to my battalions when you meet the americans

151
00:16:12.32 --> 00:16:17.20
divide yourself into many groups and attack the column from all directions and divide the

152
00:16:17.20 --> 00:16:25.76
column into as many pieces move inside the column grab them by the belt and thus avoid casualties

153
00:16:25.76 --> 00:16:32.08
from the artillery and air we had some advantages now for let me just talk about that one real quick

154
00:16:32.08 --> 00:16:38.32
okay two things first of all get the battalion split up right and if you hear and i always talk

155
00:16:38.32 --> 00:16:42.96
about the common theme of keeping things together keeping people consolidated keeping your groups where

156
00:16:42.96 --> 00:16:47.12
they can mutually support each other his goal is the opposite that get them split up so they can't

157
00:16:47.12 --> 00:16:52.32
support each other that's number one so contrary to that what you should always be doing as a

158
00:16:52.32 --> 00:16:57.28
leader is trying to keep your forces as consolidated as possible so that they can they can maneuver

159
00:16:57.28 --> 00:17:02.72
well together and most important support each other to cover move hmm now the second part of this

160
00:17:02.72 --> 00:17:08.80
is move inside the column grab them by the belt and thus avoid casualties from artillery and air

161
00:17:08.80 --> 00:17:14.16
that's something that we still see to this day we talked about it with the session conflict that

162
00:17:14.16 --> 00:17:21.12
was the sessions mode of operand motors operand i to take to get inside and be right next to the

163
00:17:21.12 --> 00:17:25.84
Russians they call it hugging they would get in there and and get in the same building as the Russians

164
00:17:25.84 --> 00:17:30.96
so you can't call fire on your own building so that's what the that's what the Vietnamese

165
00:17:30.96 --> 00:17:34.72
were trying to do now what's beautiful about these statements think about these two statements

166
00:17:34.72 --> 00:17:42.56
this is beautiful commanders intent here's all i want you to do split them up get close to them

167
00:17:42.56 --> 00:17:46.32
that's what i want you to do he's not saying how to do he's not telling each individual

168
00:17:46.32 --> 00:17:51.36
group where to move and what to do he is hands split them up and get close to him and stay close

169
00:17:51.36 --> 00:18:02.000
to him this is gives the guys on the battlefield incredible flexibility to execute that plan

170
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.68
we had some advantages on continuing we had some advantages we attacked your column from the

171
00:18:07.68 --> 00:18:13.68
sides at the moment of attack we were waiting for you this was our reserve battalion and they were

172
00:18:13.68 --> 00:18:18.16
just waiting for their turn the eight battalion had not been used in fighting in this campaign

173
00:18:18.16 --> 00:18:25.28
they were fresh spec for dick acumen was the right flank point man in the recon platoon

174
00:18:25.28 --> 00:18:31.92
which was itself the point of the battalion says acumen we were going to the left to a clearing

175
00:18:31.92 --> 00:18:36.88
we had gone about a hundred feet when he heard some shots then more shots and finally all

176
00:18:36.88 --> 00:18:42.72
hell broke loose the main brunt of the attack was right where we had been standing just a few minutes

177
00:18:42.72 --> 00:18:48.80
before we hit the dirt i was laying in the middle of a clearing and bullets were kicking dirt in my

178
00:18:48.80 --> 00:18:57.12
eyes and breaking off the grass acumen's first sergeant was standing shouting and giving directions

179
00:18:57.12 --> 00:19:01.36
his shirt was off and he was in a t-shirt he lifted his left arm to point and i could see

180
00:19:01.36 --> 00:19:05.92
were a bullet and ripped them ripped open the side of his arm and part of the side of his chest

181
00:19:06.96 --> 00:19:12.16
he was still giving orders we were then ordered to another part of the circle that was weak

182
00:19:12.16 --> 00:19:17.44
it was facing the main area of attack there were people running everywhere we couldn't just open

183
00:19:17.44 --> 00:19:22.88
fire in that direction because our guys were there we were on semi automatic and picking off

184
00:19:22.88 --> 00:19:32.32
whoever we could be sure of as a target so this just turns into immediately into chaos and again

185
00:19:32.32 --> 00:19:38.24
this is why consolidation of your forces is so important because the minute you have enemy in

186
00:19:38.24 --> 00:19:42.88
between you and other friendly forces your field of fire is completely shut off and you're likely

187
00:19:42.88 --> 00:19:47.36
when you are pulling the trigger you have a good chance you're going to shoot some of your own

188
00:19:47.36 --> 00:19:54.16
guys so that's again why consolidation of forces is very very important now i say this all the time

189
00:19:54.16 --> 00:19:58.88
i'll make the caveat again are there times where you can get away with with splitting your forces

190
00:19:58.88 --> 00:20:02.88
and there are other times that it makes sense yes absolutely there are times that it makes sense and

191
00:20:02.88 --> 00:20:07.84
we did all kinds of operations overseas where we had different units out on the battlefield that

192
00:20:07.84 --> 00:20:12.48
were split up and maneuvering from different areas we did all the time but you have to know and

193
00:20:12.48 --> 00:20:18.80
understand the risks you have to know and understand the risks of splitting forces of having

194
00:20:18.80 --> 00:20:24.40
enemy in between of trying to consolidate back together which is very very difficult you just have

195
00:20:24.40 --> 00:20:28.64
to really think about what the risks are and how you can mitigate those risks sometimes you can do

196
00:20:28.64 --> 00:20:34.000
with a terrain feature you can put guys in a certain area where hey i have free fire because you're

197
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.24
down behind a null or you're in a ravine where i know that i can't shoot you that's the type of

198
00:20:40.24 --> 00:20:45.92
thing that you can do to mitigate but it is something that people think they can get away with

199
00:20:46.64 --> 00:20:52.40
and you know matter of fact we were doing FTX and it was interesting we had one of the

200
00:20:52.40 --> 00:21:00.16
females during the planning phase we we have them plan just a a couple operations just to sort of

201
00:21:00.16 --> 00:21:06.40
get used to planning before we start the actual FTX this is for those of you don't know we have

202
00:21:06.40 --> 00:21:11.20
a company called national and front and sometimes we do field training exercises with the companies

203
00:21:11.20 --> 00:21:20.08
we're working with to get them to help instill in them the fundamental principles of combat leadership

204
00:21:20.08 --> 00:21:26.32
so it was funny this this one female she had come up with this plan and they were going to

205
00:21:26.32 --> 00:21:29.84
enter this target building from two different directions talking about the classroom course

206
00:21:29.84 --> 00:21:36.32
yes the classroom course that they did and she actually i said you know we've said keep it simple

207
00:21:36.32 --> 00:21:40.56
and it can be a little bit confusing if you start entering a building from two different sides

208
00:21:40.56 --> 00:21:46.32
and you're now you've got guns pointed at each other and you know you've got to be careful

209
00:21:46.32 --> 00:21:53.76
that you don't shoot each other and and she literally said i just don't see how it's going to happen

210
00:21:53.76 --> 00:22:00.72
that we could go into this building and we're just going to start shooting each other yeah of course

211
00:22:00.72 --> 00:22:08.32
inside and said okay and and literally the next day during the FTX phase of the training

212
00:22:08.88 --> 00:22:17.44
which we're using airsoft weapons and you're shooting at bad guys they came up with a plan

213
00:22:17.44 --> 00:22:23.04
entered a building from two sides and she entered the building and literally shot one of her own

214
00:22:23.04 --> 00:22:27.60
people she did exactly what she didn't think could happen yeah and and that's what people

215
00:22:27.60 --> 00:22:32.24
have to understand now you might think oh well it's this girl or this female and she was she's not a

216
00:22:32.24 --> 00:22:38.88
military person and it's you know that's why it happened no i saw seals do it on the regular

217
00:22:38.88 --> 00:22:45.92
you're all hyped up you go in that room you see a person moving crack crack them fire a couple shots

218
00:22:45.92 --> 00:22:53.68
and then you realize what happened so so that's what's going on here split forces things are going

219
00:22:53.68 --> 00:23:01.92
crazy now here we go acrimans back to the book acrimans recomplitude leader lieutenant pain

220
00:23:03.12 --> 00:23:08.24
he says all hell broke loose up along the north side of the lz i turned to my right and observed

221
00:23:08.24 --> 00:23:13.04
some american soldiers moving toward the northwest to set up positions and they went down in a hail of bullets

222
00:23:13.04 --> 00:23:18.72
within minutes we were all under heavy attack and my radio operator and i were pinned down in the

223
00:23:18.72 --> 00:23:24.16
middle of the lz with the most of the fire with most of the fire coming from the north and north west

224
00:23:25.04 --> 00:23:30.000
lieutenant pain's radio opera came alive as the alpha company platoon leaders reported heavy

225
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.76
fighting pain says mortar rounds began falling which was a new experience to everyone since we had

226
00:23:35.76 --> 00:23:42.08
never had any kind of mortar fire against us the noise level was unbelievable i remember pressing my

227
00:23:42.08 --> 00:23:46.96
body flatter against the ground and i have ever been in my life and thinking that certainly the

228
00:23:46.96 --> 00:23:54.40
highest thing sticking up were my heels mortars continue to fall in small arms and machine gun fire

229
00:23:54.40 --> 00:24:01.36
continue to hectic pace finally my mind seemed to adjust and i once again began to think about the

230
00:24:01.36 --> 00:24:06.88
situation we were in and what we were going to do so you see there's a leader he's pinned down

231
00:24:06.88 --> 00:24:12.000
and this is something that the the insurgents and i rack would do as well they're going to hit you

232
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.20
with multiple different weapon systems you know in a combined coordinated attack so if you can imagine

233
00:24:17.20 --> 00:24:22.16
if you start hitting people with mortars well everyone needs to get down you need to get down

234
00:24:22.16 --> 00:24:27.12
you need to take cover wall you're taking cover that's that's cover they're going to move

235
00:24:27.12 --> 00:24:30.40
they're going to maneuver in they're going to maneuver in with with heavy weapons or they're going to

236
00:24:30.40 --> 00:24:35.28
move maneuver in with an assault squad or they're going to maneuver in with a vehicle born i ed so this is

237
00:24:35.28 --> 00:24:38.88
same thing happening here as you're getting mortars which these guys aren't used to which

238
00:24:38.88 --> 00:24:42.16
there's not that there's that much you can do to get used to it because it doesn't matter

239
00:24:42.16 --> 00:24:45.44
it doesn't help you defend it you can be used to it you still have to get down you still have to take cover

240
00:24:46.56 --> 00:24:53.28
these guys are taking cover and what i found interesting about this was you can see in his

241
00:24:53.28 --> 00:24:58.56
mind for a couple seconds maybe 30 seconds he's just going holy crap i'm going to die

242
00:24:59.28 --> 00:25:03.76
and then finally he says my mind seemed to adjust and once again he'd be in think about the situation

243
00:25:03.76 --> 00:25:08.40
we were in and what we're going to do now this is where combat experience is helpful if you haven't

244
00:25:08.40 --> 00:25:13.68
been in the situation before it's going to take you a few seconds to adapt and be like oh dang i need to

245
00:25:13.68 --> 00:25:19.20
do something if you haven't been in that situation before you could end up with some you're it's

246
00:25:19.20 --> 00:25:22.24
going to take you some time to adjust and it's like we talk about with self defense with jiu jitsu

247
00:25:23.36 --> 00:25:29.52
if you've never been grabbed before and you've never been ground on before you've never had

248
00:25:29.52 --> 00:25:35.28
humble someone pulled you before it's your mind set takes time just to get through that before you even

249
00:25:35.28 --> 00:25:38.08
start thinking about actually defending yourself you're just getting used you're just saying

250
00:25:38.08 --> 00:25:44.64
a whole crap wise is happening however you train all the time then you're used to it you go oh okay

251
00:25:44.64 --> 00:25:48.000
someone's got me here's where we're going to get out same thing with getting punched in the face if

252
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.92
you've never been punched in the face before it takes some getting used to you're going to get

253
00:25:51.92 --> 00:25:55.28
punch three four five times before you're like wait a second i need to defend myself

254
00:25:55.28 --> 00:25:59.92
if you've been punched before boom oh i just got punched here's my reaction here's what i'm

255
00:25:59.92 --> 00:26:04.88
gonna do and you're speaking of jiu jitsu going back to getting inside that's the same thing

256
00:26:04.88 --> 00:26:08.56
getting close to someone what they were trying to do what the north of you to me is we're trying

257
00:26:08.56 --> 00:26:12.32
to get close stay close that's the same thing that jiu jitsu is you're trying to avoid the big

258
00:26:12.32 --> 00:26:16.64
punches you get in close you stay close you keep the person close to you that's how you avoid

259
00:26:16.64 --> 00:26:22.40
getting knocked out same thing so train train hard

260
00:26:22.40 --> 00:26:30.48
back to the book alpha companies alpha company alpha companies commander captain sugenis

261
00:26:30.48 --> 00:26:35.04
was in the trees headed to where he had seen the batain command group disappear

262
00:26:35.04 --> 00:26:39.04
just as i noticed a small clearing up ahead i heard one or two shots to my rear

263
00:26:39.04 --> 00:26:44.64
back where my first and second platoons were i looked back there was a pause of several seconds

264
00:26:44.64 --> 00:26:50.72
and then slowly all hell began to break loose i remember if we were reading the book

265
00:26:53.92 --> 00:26:59.12
by early pile and he talked about the expression all hell broke loose because we we just heard it like

266
00:26:59.12 --> 00:27:05.68
five times yeah and he's talking about how it gets overused but it's real and you can tell

267
00:27:05.68 --> 00:27:11.04
with these guys it's it's just absolutely real that all hell is breaking loose and i want to say

268
00:27:11.04 --> 00:27:17.12
this too because i didn't mention this about date miqdeid who's the batain commander miqdeid is

269
00:27:17.12 --> 00:27:22.24
the batain commander he had just taken over the battalion like a few weeks before and he had moved

270
00:27:22.24 --> 00:27:30.96
from some admin position inside the inside the the the i don't know if it's inside the battalion

271
00:27:30.96 --> 00:27:36.16
or inside the brigade but he had moved from like a sort of an administrative position into battalion

272
00:27:36.16 --> 00:27:40.80
command so in other words he wasn't charge of in charge of any troops and then all of a sudden

273
00:27:40.80 --> 00:27:45.28
he was in charge of troops and then three weeks later they're going into combat now that being said

274
00:27:46.40 --> 00:27:51.76
he also said that this guy hadn't been in charge of any troops in like ten years so he

275
00:27:51.76 --> 00:27:57.92
he he apparently done his platoon commander in his company command in world war two in Korea so

276
00:27:57.92 --> 00:28:04.56
miqdeid is an experienced combat leader but he's out of practice he's out of practice and more

277
00:28:04.56 --> 00:28:09.44
probably more important or just as important to to being out of practice is he just took over

278
00:28:09.44 --> 00:28:16.88
so part of being a battalion commander is that you train and prepare your troops for combat you get

279
00:28:16.88 --> 00:28:21.68
to know all your men you get to understand their weaknesses you just can't jump in and take over

280
00:28:21.68 --> 00:28:25.44
and all of a sudden have the knowledge that you would have if you were preparing everyone that's why

281
00:28:25.44 --> 00:28:32.48
training is so important that's why we train so if you are if you are not given the opportunity

282
00:28:32.48 --> 00:28:37.52
to train and learn your troops you're at a huge disadvantage you're at and you haven't had time

283
00:28:37.52 --> 00:28:43.20
to train them up to the your standards you know this guy was in World War II and Korea he

284
00:28:43.20 --> 00:28:48.000
understands combat and so to think that he wouldn't put his guys through a you know a certain

285
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.96
level of training to get them up to speed and make sure they do things like like make sure that there's

286
00:28:54.24 --> 00:28:58.88
other people in the chain of command that can step up and lead having a succession plan so

287
00:28:58.88 --> 00:29:03.60
so like him calling people forward maybe if he had trained the battalion he knew that there was

288
00:29:03.60 --> 00:29:06.72
other guys in there that would be able to take charge he didn't realize that there was like a little

289
00:29:06.72 --> 00:29:12.80
little hesitation there that was gonna happen which is what happened yeah so he doesn't know his

290
00:29:12.80 --> 00:29:18.000
his team well enough for this situation and that's not good

291
00:29:22.64 --> 00:29:28.48
back to the book captain so genie says Larry going and I hit the edge of Albany on the

292
00:29:28.48 --> 00:29:33.44
northeast side of the clearing as the column began to receive intense fire we began to receive

293
00:29:33.44 --> 00:29:38.08
sporadic sniper fire part of the recompletoon had already reached the island of the island

294
00:29:38.08 --> 00:29:43.36
they're talking about as an island of wood's an island of trees I yelled across the opening for

295
00:29:43.36 --> 00:29:48.32
someone to cover us we ran to the island at this point I called my first and second platoons on the radio

296
00:29:48.32 --> 00:29:54.88
almost immediately I lost communications with first platoon the platoon sergeant for the second platoon

297
00:29:54.88 --> 00:30:01.68
came on the radio that was sergeant first class William A. Ferrell 38 from Stanton Tennessee

298
00:30:01.68 --> 00:30:08.56
he was a veteran of World War II and Korea had been a prisoner of war in Korea and could have chosen

299
00:30:08.56 --> 00:30:15.84
to remain in the states he did not have to deploy with Vietnam with us everyone called him

300
00:30:15.84 --> 00:30:22.16
papi Ferrell kept asking captain sergeini's where he was telling him that they were mixed up with

301
00:30:22.16 --> 00:30:28.64
the north Vietnamese and had several wounded and killed I couldn't pinpoint his location I knew

302
00:30:28.64 --> 00:30:35.20
where he should have been directly east of our island papi then radio that he was hit that there

303
00:30:35.20 --> 00:30:41.68
were three or four men with him all hit I could hear the firing at his location over the radio

304
00:30:42.88 --> 00:30:47.04
I never heard from papi again he did not survive

305
00:30:47.04 --> 00:30:58.56
this confusion that happened this is far go war stuff this is this complete far go war stuff

306
00:30:58.56 --> 00:31:04.88
and by the way the enemy gets a vote the enemy gets a vote the enemy can do things like this

307
00:31:04.88 --> 00:31:09.04
that you don't expect the enemy can hit you from multiple sides the enemy can have a strategy

308
00:31:09.04 --> 00:31:12.24
to get or attack to getting close that's what the enemy is going to do

309
00:31:12.24 --> 00:31:19.20
you don't know what the enemy is going to do actually you don't know what they're going to do

310
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.76
you don't know they're going to have mortars this time

311
00:31:25.76 --> 00:31:30.72
back to the book lieutenant Colonel McDade himself recalls when things began happening I got in

312
00:31:30.72 --> 00:31:37.68
without for company I know I was trying to figure out what was going on I moved very fast let's get

313
00:31:37.68 --> 00:31:43.36
over there in those trees and let's all get together the enemy seemed to be all over the woods

314
00:31:44.88 --> 00:31:50.88
we had good tight control in the immediate area and we're trying to figure out where everybody else

315
00:31:50.88 --> 00:31:57.20
was one of the things I was very concerned with was people being trigger happy and just shooting up

316
00:31:57.20 --> 00:32:02.000
the grass I was telling them make sure you know what you're shooting at because we are scattered

317
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.24
so notice how he says this we had good tight control in the immediate area and we're trying to figure

318
00:32:08.24 --> 00:32:14.56
out where everyone else is this is horrible it shows you two things when you have good tight control

319
00:32:14.56 --> 00:32:19.36
over people you're okay if you know where your people are you're okay there's the one of the

320
00:32:19.36 --> 00:32:26.24
worst feelings on the battlefield is not knowing where your guys are that is one of the worst

321
00:32:26.24 --> 00:32:32.64
feelings on the battlefield not knowing where your guys are and sitting there trying to figure out

322
00:32:32.64 --> 00:32:39.20
where everyone else is which I guess those two are the same things and so the biggest concern that

323
00:32:39.20 --> 00:32:47.04
he has right now is like he's so concerned about friendly fire keep control your people

324
00:32:50.24 --> 00:32:55.52
back to the book the battalion operations officer captain spires believes that the the fact that

325
00:32:55.52 --> 00:33:00.48
the commanders were absent from their companies when the fight started contributed to the confusion

326
00:33:01.20 --> 00:33:08.88
it had the most effect I think on Charlie company their commander captain skip festmire was up with

327
00:33:08.88 --> 00:33:15.52
us and Don Cornet the Charlie company executive officer was killed early on so they had no commander

328
00:33:15.52 --> 00:33:22.88
and they just disintegrated so leadership is the most important thing on the battlefield

329
00:33:22.88 --> 00:33:29.60
talk about that all the time this is why this is why when you see a platoon or a company that doesn't

330
00:33:29.60 --> 00:33:36.000
have any leadership they fall apart now if you are well trained and if you have a good

331
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.60
succession plan and if you've done drills where the company commander gets killed and you take

332
00:33:39.60 --> 00:33:44.40
them out other people have to step up and lead yes that is how you prepare for these situations

333
00:33:44.40 --> 00:33:48.24
you have to prepare for those situations you have to prepare for leaders to go down

334
00:33:48.24 --> 00:33:56.72
but if you have no one that steps up you're going to be in a real hard way real fast

335
00:33:59.84 --> 00:34:05.76
back to the book the entire area is now alive with north Vietnamese soldiers who had obviously

336
00:34:05.76 --> 00:34:10.48
cut through the battalions line of march severing the head of the battalion from the body

337
00:34:10.48 --> 00:34:17.20
go in saw three jia jia is coming through the high grass running from the area swarming with enemy

338
00:34:17.84 --> 00:34:23.68
I jumped up and screamed to them waving my arm they saw me and headed directly to our position

339
00:34:23.68 --> 00:34:28.40
the first man was a captain our air force forward air controller who is completely spent

340
00:34:28.40 --> 00:34:32.40
I pointed out the battalion command group which was huddled to our rear at the at another

341
00:34:32.40 --> 00:34:38.000
ant hill and he crawled toward them he was followed by the battalion sergeant major Jim Scott

342
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.48
who dropped down next to me and Scott was followed by a young very small pfc who was delirious

343
00:34:44.48 --> 00:34:51.52
and holding his guts in with his hands he kept asking are the helicopters coming I said yes hang on

344
00:34:55.92 --> 00:35:00.56
the battalion commander initially thought that the incoming rounds were all friendly fire

345
00:35:01.84 --> 00:35:07.28
so think about that the battalion commander initially thought that the incoming rounds were all

346
00:35:07.28 --> 00:35:12.08
friendly fire so what does reaction take cover don't wish you back which is actually

347
00:35:13.36 --> 00:35:17.60
if you're getting maneuvered on by an enemy the worst possible thing you can do is take cover

348
00:35:17.60 --> 00:35:21.12
and not shoot back because that means the enemy is going to maneuver faster on you back to the

349
00:35:21.12 --> 00:35:26.48
book he had been hollering for all of us to cease fire and the word went out over the command net

350
00:35:26.48 --> 00:35:30.72
but to no avail as the troops on the perimeter could see north Vietnamese

351
00:35:30.72 --> 00:35:37.92
the can you imagine the confusion you've got the battalion commander on the command net yelling

352
00:35:37.92 --> 00:35:41.68
to everyone to cease fire meanwhile you can literally see north Vietnamese and you're shooting and

353
00:35:41.68 --> 00:35:47.60
engaging them this is this is meham the sergeant major and I were looking to the rear when I

354
00:35:47.60 --> 00:35:52.88
heard a loud blast the sergeant major yelled I'm hit he had taken around in the back

355
00:35:52.88 --> 00:35:58.16
under his armpit and there was a large hole underneath his right arm I told him he would be okay

356
00:35:58.16 --> 00:36:05.36
to bandage it himself this he did ripping off his shirt then he picked up his M16 and

357
00:36:05.36 --> 00:36:10.32
headed back to one of the ant hills I saw the sergeant major a few times after that and he was fighting

358
00:36:10.32 --> 00:36:18.08
like a demon sergeant major Scott says I took a bullet through my chest not more than 15 or 20 minutes

359
00:36:18.08 --> 00:36:23.52
into the battle I could see enemy soldiers to our left right and front in the in platoon and company

360
00:36:23.52 --> 00:36:30.64
size elements they were up in trees up on top of ant hills and in the high grass we weren't exactly

361
00:36:30.64 --> 00:36:36.88
organized we didn't have time everything happened all at once I didn't see a whole being dug up

362
00:36:36.88 --> 00:36:43.12
prior to 8pm that night we did use the trees and ant hills for cover within a half an hour there

363
00:36:43.12 --> 00:36:49.44
was an attempt to organize groups into defense a position in a company area individuals did this

364
00:36:49.44 --> 00:36:57.68
no one in particular I think that's what saved us so this is decentralized command coming out

365
00:36:57.68 --> 00:37:02.000
you the only thing that gets them together is that individuals stepped up and said okay we need

366
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.76
to form a perimeter defense now unfortunately half an hour an hour had already passed when they got to

367
00:37:07.76 --> 00:37:13.52
this point where the individual start making the call the other thing is there's a lack of overall

368
00:37:13.52 --> 00:37:20.88
direction so you get to a point where if everyone knew hey here's the position we're going to be in

369
00:37:20.88 --> 00:37:24.48
the battalion here's our formation if something happens here's what we're going to do we're going to

370
00:37:24.48 --> 00:37:28.88
bound towards this area you there's all kinds of contingency plans that could have been done here

371
00:37:28.88 --> 00:37:34.56
no again I'm doing hindsight 2020 which I hate doing but we are trying to learn

372
00:37:35.68 --> 00:37:40.08
and we are trying to talk to all the military people that are listening to this that are out doing

373
00:37:40.08 --> 00:37:48.48
operations right now think about this and I had this probably told this story before but when we first

374
00:37:48.48 --> 00:37:58.16
got to Ramadi my one of the junior officers was taking a patrol out and it was a combined

375
00:37:58.16 --> 00:38:03.68
patrol with some Iraqi soldiers and some seals and he was going over the patrol route with me

376
00:38:03.68 --> 00:38:08.32
and he got to this big open field and he said yeah I'm going to go we have to go across this

377
00:38:08.32 --> 00:38:11.12
field because it's only way to get from here to there and I said what are you going to do when you

378
00:38:11.12 --> 00:38:14.96
get this open field he said what we're going to get across it that's how you're going to get across it

379
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.64
and he said well we're going to walk across it I said what if you get hit and he didn't really have

380
00:38:20.64 --> 00:38:24.000
any answer I said okay so here's what you're going to do leave some guys in the tree line over here

381
00:38:25.20 --> 00:38:29.60
have these guys bound across to this little dark right here then those guys can join them

382
00:38:29.60 --> 00:38:34.32
cover move just cover move across this field and that's what they did and sure enough they actually

383
00:38:34.32 --> 00:38:39.60
got hit they got hit with a pretty significant attack and with more resistance small long fire and

384
00:38:39.60 --> 00:38:46.80
they covered moved out of the situation but my point is looking at the terrain beforehand having a plan

385
00:38:46.80 --> 00:38:50.000
and the next cut in the plan and dictating the situation you're going to be it instead of letting

386
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:57.04
the situation dictate what happens to you don't do that it's not a good answer situation

387
00:38:57.04 --> 00:39:01.44
dictates that's not a good we dictate this situation talked about it before

388
00:39:01.44 --> 00:39:10.80
and then have your like the Vietnamese command was very broad the commanders intent get close

389
00:39:10.80 --> 00:39:15.36
split them up these guys didn't have a command like that what could the opposite command would

390
00:39:15.36 --> 00:39:25.04
been stick together stick together keep integrity well there you go don't let them in close okay there you go

391
00:39:25.04 --> 00:39:37.12
back to the book Sudanese and Gwen are agree that it was not long after this at the

392
00:39:37.12 --> 00:39:41.20
Alph the commander of Alphacompanese missing second platoon lieutenant Gordon Grove staggered

393
00:39:41.20 --> 00:39:45.92
into the American position from the east here's Larry going talking I saw Gordon Gordon

394
00:39:45.92 --> 00:39:51.76
Gordon Grove coming across the field along with two wounded men they were the only ones left of

395
00:39:51.76 --> 00:39:58.72
this platoon who could move Grove was distraught we got him and his two men with us and our

396
00:39:58.72 --> 00:40:04.56
got our men ex working on the wounded then Gordon asked for men to go back with him to get his people

397
00:40:05.60 --> 00:40:12.80
Joe Shadini's said Gordon I can't send anybody about else back out there it was clear that to leave

398
00:40:12.80 --> 00:40:19.84
this perimeter was deaf everywhere you looked you could see north Vietnamese Gordon asked for

399
00:40:19.84 --> 00:40:25.36
permission to go talk to the battalion commander so Jeanne said go ahead he jogged over

400
00:40:25.36 --> 00:40:30.88
asked me to aid for help to get his men got a negative response so he came back to our

401
00:40:30.88 --> 00:40:37.12
handheld so this is one of those classic examples you hear about all time people will try and get you in the

402
00:40:39.76 --> 00:40:43.60
the catch twenty two question like the got you question what what would you do if you were in the

403
00:40:43.60 --> 00:40:47.68
situation and you some of you guys were still out there but you didn't have enough people to go

404
00:40:47.68 --> 00:40:51.92
get him or you were being overwhelmed what would you do well here's what these guys did right here

405
00:40:51.92 --> 00:40:56.16
they'll know you can't go get him if you send in more people out there they're gonna die if they

406
00:40:56.16 --> 00:41:00.32
did if we send 10 guys out there 15 guys out there 18 guys out there to go recover the splin we're

407
00:41:00.32 --> 00:41:05.20
gonna lose 18 more guys we're gonna stay put we're in fight as best we can from here we'll get fire

408
00:41:05.20 --> 00:41:14.64
superiority back we'll get our shit together and then we'll go get these guys go in ads there was

409
00:41:14.64 --> 00:41:19.20
a tremendous battle going on in the vicinity of where we had come into the clearing and beyond

410
00:41:19.20 --> 00:41:25.12
there in the jungle it was Charlie company caught in the killing zone of the ambush fighting for

411
00:41:25.12 --> 00:41:31.04
its life the mortar fire had ceased the enemy tubes apparently had been overrun by Charlie company

412
00:41:31.04 --> 00:41:35.92
because we found them all the next day but there were still hundreds of North Vietnamese

413
00:41:35.92 --> 00:41:42.88
calmly walking around the area we were observing now began the sniping phase of our battle

414
00:41:42.88 --> 00:41:47.52
I call it that because for a long period of time all we did was pick off enemy wandering around

415
00:41:47.52 --> 00:41:52.56
our perimeter and this last until we started getting air support everything that had happened to

416
00:41:52.56 --> 00:41:57.04
this point had probably taken less than 30 minutes

417
00:42:01.20 --> 00:42:05.84
Gwen saw major frank Henry the batalion executive officer lying on his back using the radio

418
00:42:05.84 --> 00:42:10.96
trying desperately to get some tactical air support and succeeding the air was on the way but

419
00:42:10.96 --> 00:42:18.16
there was no artillery or aerial rocket artillery yet Jim Spires the S3 ran over to us and

420
00:42:18.16 --> 00:42:23.92
queried Gordon Grove Gordon Grove as the situation outside the perimeter where he had just come from

421
00:42:24.64 --> 00:42:29.12
Grove told him there were still men out there tightened into a small perimeter but they were all

422
00:42:29.12 --> 00:42:34.88
wounded and dying and the radio has had all been knocked out Captain Spires asked a second time

423
00:42:34.88 --> 00:42:38.40
if he thought anyone would still alive and none of us said anything

424
00:42:38.40 --> 00:42:45.12
Gwen climbed up top a termite hill and began sniping at the North Vietnamese visible across

425
00:42:45.12 --> 00:42:50.40
the clearing in the trees to the south with Xem 16 rifle there were plenty of targets and I

426
00:42:50.40 --> 00:42:56.88
remember picking off 10 or 15 NVA from my position my memories revolve around the way in which

427
00:42:56.88 --> 00:43:03.52
each enemy soldier fell that I hit someone simply limp slump limply to the ground some reacted

428
00:43:03.52 --> 00:43:09.60
as if they had been hit by a truck some that I missed on the first and second shots kept on

429
00:43:09.60 --> 00:43:15.52
milling around until I finally hit them what we did not know at the time was that they were wandering

430
00:43:15.52 --> 00:43:21.68
around the elephant grass looking for Americans who were still alive and killing them off one by one

431
00:43:26.72 --> 00:43:31.52
North Vietnamese soldiers climbed into trees and on top of those brush covered termite hills

432
00:43:31.52 --> 00:43:36.72
and poured fire down on the cavalry troops troopers trapped in the tall grass below them in

433
00:43:36.72 --> 00:43:43.36
the main body of the column there was serious firing including mortar fire both from both sides

434
00:43:44.40 --> 00:43:48.32
the strike at the head of the column was followed so quickly by the enemy encircling

435
00:43:48.32 --> 00:43:55.84
assaults that the whole business seemed to erupt almost simultaneously without doubt some of

436
00:43:55.84 --> 00:44:02.08
some platoons of mixtades battalion were alert and in as secure a formation as they could achieve

437
00:44:02.08 --> 00:44:08.88
in the elephant grass brush and fix scrub trees but the visibility problem made it difficult to

438
00:44:08.88 --> 00:44:14.16
maintain formation and one result was that American troop for closer to one another then was

439
00:44:14.16 --> 00:44:20.48
tactically sound providing juicy granite juicy targets for a grenade mortar round or a burst from

440
00:44:20.48 --> 00:44:28.96
AK 47 rifle all down the column platoon leaders sergeants radio operators and riflemen by the

441
00:44:28.96 --> 00:44:36.80
dozens were killed or wounded in the first 10 minutes rapidly degrading communication cohesion and control

442
00:44:41.28 --> 00:44:45.76
to this whole thing that we've talked about up in this poem is like a half an hour just a brutal

443
00:44:45.76 --> 00:44:55.52
onslaught that kicked off with massive violence of action Captain Fesmire adds the result was

444
00:44:55.52 --> 00:45:04.24
very intense individual hand to hand combat in the confusion I had no idea exactly where the

445
00:45:04.24 --> 00:45:09.76
company was located when lieutenant cornet died it was virtually impossible for me to talk to

446
00:45:09.76 --> 00:45:24.16
anyone in my company the battle had clearly become an individual struggle for life again that was

447
00:45:24.16 --> 00:45:30.64
the goal of the Vietnamese was to make it an individual struggle was to get in close was to separate

448
00:45:30.64 --> 00:45:37.04
people from the main battalion to split it up into as many parts as possible so they could pick

449
00:45:37.04 --> 00:45:44.56
it apart. Spec 4 jacksmith who is in Charlie company had been a radio operator until about a

450
00:45:44.56 --> 00:45:50.64
week or so before this operation when he was shifted to a supply clerk's job the events of November

451
00:45:50.64 --> 00:45:58.40
17 are etched on his mind. Smith's company commander Captain Fesmire had like the others been

452
00:45:58.40 --> 00:46:05.52
called to the front by lieutenant Colonel McDade subsequently many people pointed to this as a major

453
00:46:05.52 --> 00:46:13.20
error and in light of what has happened it was the firing began to roll on all around us the executive

454
00:46:13.20 --> 00:46:18.80
officer of my company a man called Don Cornette a very fine officer jumped up and in the best

455
00:46:18.80 --> 00:46:26.16
style of the infantry school yelled follow me elements of our first and second platoons ran right

456
00:46:26.16 --> 00:46:31.36
towards a series of ant hills within 10 feet of them we saw where the machine gunners behind them

457
00:46:31.36 --> 00:46:40.08
firing point blank at us man all around me began to fall like moan grass i had never seen

458
00:46:40.08 --> 00:46:47.12
people killed before they began to drop like flies and die right in front of me these were the only

459
00:46:47.12 --> 00:46:54.000
friends i had and they were dying all around me

460
00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:06.24
private first class james h shadden was in forps delta company mortar platoon

461
00:47:07.44 --> 00:47:12.80
the intensity of the fire increased to the point where shadden couldn't hear anything but weapons firing

462
00:47:14.32 --> 00:47:18.88
and here's what he says tone johnson came crawling with me hitting the cheek in the back of the

463
00:47:18.88 --> 00:47:24.40
hand the trees were full of north Vietnamese but spotting one was almost impossible they blended in so

464
00:47:24.40 --> 00:47:30.88
well i kept raising up to try and detect a good target math you sheltered who is laying next to me

465
00:47:30.88 --> 00:47:36.96
kept jerky me down as i raised up again a bullet pierced my helmet straight through front to back

466
00:47:37.92 --> 00:47:45.04
i went down again and came back and as i came back up a bullet struck the tree beside my head from

467
00:47:45.04 --> 00:47:53.92
behind i don't know if we were surrounded or was our own men they were firing wild anything that moved

468
00:47:53.92 --> 00:48:00.24
somebody shot at it one trooper crawled up next to me shooting through the grass a few inches off the

469
00:48:00.24 --> 00:48:05.76
ground toward where our own people lay never thinking what he was doing i told him to be sure he knew

470
00:48:05.76 --> 00:48:14.80
what he was shooting at the firing eventually began to slack off shadden has no idea how much time

471
00:48:14.80 --> 00:48:22.80
elapsed there was no way to keep track of time in a fight like this men were wounded and dead all in

472
00:48:22.80 --> 00:48:31.52
the area six were alive that i know of sergeant Tyler pfc Carter pfc johnson pfc shelton pfc

473
00:48:31.52 --> 00:48:40.32
cones and myself Tyler gave the only order i heard during the entire fight tried to pull back

474
00:48:40.32 --> 00:48:49.28
before they finish us off sheldon froze to the ground and would not move the five of us

475
00:48:49.28 --> 00:48:54.56
proceeded to try and pull back but the snipers were still in the trees soon i was hitting the right

476
00:48:54.56 --> 00:49:00.96
shoulder which for a time rendered at useless Tyler was hitting the neck about the same time he

477
00:49:00.96 --> 00:49:07.04
died in arms length for me begging for the medic spec for william pleasant who is already dead

478
00:49:07.04 --> 00:49:20.48
the last words Tyler ever spoke or i'm dying sergeant Tyler 35 was from Columbia South Carolina

479
00:49:24.08 --> 00:49:30.96
the helplessness i felt is beyond description within a few minutes i was hit again in the left knee

480
00:49:30.96 --> 00:49:40.48
the pain was unbearable cones who's hitting the feet and ankle we were wounded and trapped

481
00:49:41.92 --> 00:49:49.28
i could see we were getting wiped out a buddy helped me bandage my leg he got the bandage off a

482
00:49:49.28 --> 00:49:56.48
dead Vietnamese i got behind a log and there was a Vietnamese there busted up and dead

483
00:49:56.48 --> 00:50:04.32
this was behind us so i knew we were surrounded

484
00:50:12.08 --> 00:50:19.12
it's for me it's crazy to think these are Americans it really is you know it's crazy to thank you

485
00:50:19.12 --> 00:50:26.24
you always think knifely so that Americans have the upper hand all the time but you know

486
00:50:26.24 --> 00:50:31.44
here you are you you you you don't you don't always have the upper hand

487
00:50:37.68 --> 00:50:42.16
if you're chatting continues on it appears as if the ground was opening up and swallowing

488
00:50:42.16 --> 00:50:49.60
the mortarmen they they felt so fast a brown wave of death rolled over them and on into Charlie

489
00:50:49.60 --> 00:50:57.44
Company Vietnamese intermixed with them then reality said in the enemy held ground beyond the

490
00:50:57.44 --> 00:51:04.000
downhill the column was cut in half in coming fire drew our attention back to the tree line

491
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:10.40
the firing increased rapidly we returned fire at muscle flashes i heard an explosion behind me

492
00:51:10.40 --> 00:51:16.72
turning i saw chai congregate's landing all flash and smoke no casualties the volume of fire

493
00:51:16.72 --> 00:51:24.40
became almost unindurable bullets peeled bark from trees vegetation disintegrated i looked to

494
00:51:24.40 --> 00:51:30.72
lieutenant James Lawrence for help saw his head violently recoil he hit the ground

495
00:51:38.24 --> 00:51:42.64
here's another description back to the book here's what the Vietnam War looked like in the

496
00:51:42.64 --> 00:51:48.56
afternoon of November 17 through the eyes of two of Captain Forrest Alpha Company Rifleman

497
00:51:49.12 --> 00:51:57.84
PFC David or a perp lavender of Murphy's Burrow Illinois and spec for James Young of steel

498
00:51:57.84 --> 00:52:04.72
ville Missouri says lavender my platoon was bringing up the rear we started to maneuver and work our

499
00:52:04.72 --> 00:52:10.24
way up the column to help those ahead every time we made a move we were hit by mortars

500
00:52:10.24 --> 00:52:17.52
it was something you can't describe people were dropping like flies the first blast killed a young soldier

501
00:52:18.32 --> 00:52:24.80
named loca telly every time we moved they dropped mortars on us i know we must have had 12

502
00:52:24.80 --> 00:52:31.28
or 15 wounded out of our platoon including our platoon leader these were my buddies i had been with

503
00:52:31.28 --> 00:52:37.52
in the army for two years the majority of our whole battalion had been drafted at age 21 and it

504
00:52:37.52 --> 00:52:45.52
had been the service for over 18 months all of us were nearly 23 years old they became my brothers

505
00:52:45.52 --> 00:52:52.88
over time hearing these fellow scream hearing them killed stuck in my heart and mind ever since

506
00:52:55.12 --> 00:53:01.04
the most critical part of this fight was the beginning it was the surprise

507
00:53:01.04 --> 00:53:09.20
this they had us in a U shaped ambush and they had us cut off with mortars

508
00:53:11.52 --> 00:53:20.56
surprise and violence of action surprise and violence of action two key elements of fire fights

509
00:53:22.24 --> 00:53:26.80
and here's what young said the other the other individual introduced a moment ago

510
00:53:26.80 --> 00:53:34.24
there was a grassy field to my left 25 or 30 yards and a sniper off on my right i couldn't

511
00:53:34.24 --> 00:53:40.88
see him but i saw a trace of bullet go across my hand i felt the wind of that bullet

512
00:53:42.24 --> 00:53:47.52
the same bullet passed over the back of Smith's neck he was lucky he had his head down

513
00:53:48.56 --> 00:53:52.96
our company commander captain force came running along our line he was stopping and telling

514
00:53:52.96 --> 00:53:58.24
everybody where to go he acted as though he was immune to enemy fire i don't know how he kept from

515
00:53:58.24 --> 00:54:11.12
getting hit so captain for a stepping up and leading and what's all things do not happen without leadership

516
00:54:12.56 --> 00:54:18.48
so in less he gets up and makes these things happen they are not going to happen that's what

517
00:54:18.48 --> 00:54:23.36
you do is a leader you have to make things happen talk about it all the time there's an example of it

518
00:54:25.44 --> 00:54:27.76
things do not happen unless you make them happen

519
00:54:32.48 --> 00:54:39.92
now if you remember that oftentimes in Vietnam there would be a command and control helicopter

520
00:54:39.92 --> 00:54:45.52
and we talked about this on 105 where the brigade commander actually came and landed for a little

521
00:54:45.52 --> 00:54:51.76
bit and then left well that was Colonel Tim Brown and here we have a little section with talking

522
00:54:51.76 --> 00:54:56.80
about what's going on with him back to the book Colonel Tim Brown telecopter was running low on fuel

523
00:54:56.80 --> 00:55:03.60
and the chopper had to return to refuel brown says i knew they weren't a contact i did not know

524
00:55:03.60 --> 00:55:10.16
house of your or anything else while i was talking to McDade i could hear rifle fire but he didn't

525
00:55:10.16 --> 00:55:18.56
know what was happening i asked what happened to your lead unit he didn't know where's your trailing units

526
00:55:18.56 --> 00:55:25.20
he didn't know and he didn't know what happened to any of the rest of them nobody knew what the

527
00:55:25.20 --> 00:55:29.76
hell was going on we were not in a position to shoot a bunch of artillery or air strikes in there

528
00:55:29.76 --> 00:55:36.88
because we didn't know where to put them only now that Colonel Brown began rounding up reinforcements

529
00:55:36.88 --> 00:55:49.68
to send in to help bobbic dates second battalion you notice what he wants to know is where people are

530
00:55:49.68 --> 00:55:53.92
that that's the you've heard me talk about this before i used to ask the you young junior officer what's

531
00:55:53.92 --> 00:55:57.20
the most important piece of information you you can have on the battlefield and they tell where the

532
00:55:57.20 --> 00:56:02.000
enemy is and how how many there are and what kind of weapons there are and no the most important piece of

533
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.000
information there is on the battlefield is where you are and i actually tell the same thing to businesses

534
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.88
because sometimes businesses don't know where they are because they're not tracking what they're doing

535
00:56:09.60 --> 00:56:13.44
so you ask them hey where are you and your in your p and l and your profit lost they don't know

536
00:56:14.88 --> 00:56:18.40
you ask them where they're doing and there's where their sales performance is they don't know

537
00:56:18.40 --> 00:56:24.72
well how are we going to make any changes you need to know where you are most important piece of

538
00:56:24.72 --> 00:56:34.08
information there is here's McDade talking again this is the Colonel or the the the the

539
00:56:34.08 --> 00:56:40.16
batalion commander lieutenant Colonel in charge on the ground in that first hour or so the situation

540
00:56:40.16 --> 00:56:45.12
was so fluid that i was acting more as a platoon leader than a batalion commander that's a flag red flag

541
00:56:45.12 --> 00:56:49.84
right you're acting if you're acting as a battalion leader and you're in charge of so a platoon is

542
00:56:49.84 --> 00:56:56.16
40 guys a battalion is 500 600 and he's acting as a platoon leader who's running the battalion

543
00:56:58.32 --> 00:57:02.72
we were trying to secure a perimeter i was trying to figure out what the hell was going on myself

544
00:57:02.72 --> 00:57:06.72
i don't think anybody in the battalion could have told you what the situation really was at that time

545
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:13.28
i can see where this might have left Tim Brown the brigade commander in the dark about what was

546
00:57:13.28 --> 00:57:19.76
going on i didn't know myself until things quieted down the battalion commander adds i could have

547
00:57:19.76 --> 00:57:24.88
yelled and screamed that we were in a death trap and all that crap but i didn't know it was as bad as

548
00:57:24.88 --> 00:57:30.56
it was i had no way of checking visually or physically by getting out of that perimeter so all i could

549
00:57:30.56 --> 00:57:35.76
do is hope to get back in touch i wasn't going to scream that the sky was falling

550
00:57:35.76 --> 00:57:39.44
especially in a situation where nobody could do anything about it anyways

551
00:57:46.72 --> 00:57:53.04
so if you don't know what's going on that means there's a bad problem that's that's my assessment

552
00:57:53.04 --> 00:58:02.64
and also it's also if you i'm not trying to say that you should cry wolf because you shouldn't

553
00:58:03.76 --> 00:58:11.04
but when things are going sideways you can wait for them to develop if you have a grip of what's

554
00:58:11.04 --> 00:58:15.76
happening if you don't know what's happening you better spin some people up to come help you

555
00:58:15.76 --> 00:58:21.04
at least get them spinning at least get them turning that happens a lot where the guy on the ground

556
00:58:21.04 --> 00:58:25.20
might not fully understand what's happening make the call and say hey i need i'm stand by their

557
00:58:25.20 --> 00:58:31.12
support stand by get qr f spun up you know you make those calls doesn't mean send anybody

558
00:58:31.12 --> 00:58:36.08
but get them ready get them closer get them on standby qf is quick reaction force so if i'm on

559
00:58:36.08 --> 00:58:40.08
the ground also getting shot at multiple different directions i'm not really sure what's happening

560
00:58:40.08 --> 00:58:46.24
i might not say send the qr f but i'll say hey have the qr f move to position alpha

561
00:58:46.24 --> 00:58:51.44
which is very close to where i am in case i do need them in 15 minutes or a half an hour or an hour or

562
00:58:51.44 --> 00:58:59.52
right now of at least made that progression that like for just provide some general awareness

563
00:58:59.52 --> 00:59:07.28
yeah so your qr f quick reaction force they might be they might be 30 minutes away and then it

564
00:59:07.28 --> 00:59:12.40
might need 15 minutes of notification time yeah so i mean if you call them right now

565
00:59:12.40 --> 00:59:18.32
they're going to be here in 45 minutes 45 minutes from bad firefight is not going to help you

566
00:59:18.32 --> 00:59:24.000
yeah so your first call now you might bring them in and you pre-plan this this is when i talk

567
00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.08
about pre-planning we would always pre-plan hey if we need qr f we're going to call you to this point

568
00:59:28.08 --> 00:59:32.24
here we'll call you to this point here if we need to bring you on standby we'll care call you to

569
00:59:32.24 --> 00:59:36.80
this point let's say this point is 500 meters away from where we actually are and then we have one

570
00:59:36.80 --> 00:59:41.52
that's right where we are like you come to this building if we call qr f you come to this building

571
00:59:41.52 --> 00:59:45.84
we're going to try and get into that building if you don't hear from us and we just call for qr f

572
00:59:45.84 --> 00:59:50.24
come to that building we'll be inside it the best of our ability as they get closer hopefully

573
00:59:50.24 --> 00:59:55.68
you can establish communications with them directly but if you start losing control of the situation

574
00:59:55.68 --> 01:00:01.28
this is the thing when you start losing control of the situation you call up the qr f and say

575
01:00:01.28 --> 01:00:07.76
hey move to the staging point so now they're moving you start at that 45 minute clock right

576
01:00:07.76 --> 01:00:11.76
now they've all spun up they're all getting their vehicles they're woken up the people that need to

577
01:00:11.76 --> 01:00:17.04
get out they get their vehicles and they drive so now they might get to the 500 meters away

578
01:00:17.04 --> 01:00:21.36
and i had the situation under control and i say hey we don't know you'd you come in we're okay

579
01:00:21.36 --> 01:00:25.68
pulled off in what you got their bummed but they don't care they'd rather have that

580
01:00:26.72 --> 01:00:30.32
because maybe in 30 minutes things have developed to a point where i need them and now they can

581
01:00:30.32 --> 01:00:36.08
get there in 15 minutes instead of in 45 yeah okay so again we're not trying to spin up and

582
01:00:36.08 --> 01:00:42.000
waste assets but and and actually know who did this a very similar in the in the previous podcast

583
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.60
the guy that called broken arrow which means troops are about to be overrun he didn't wait for anyone

584
01:00:45.60 --> 01:00:49.84
tell me he just called it he's okay broken arrow now it takes some time for those guys to show up

585
01:00:49.84 --> 01:01:01.28
there by the time they got there they needed them similar thing now yeah don't advocate yelling or

586
01:01:01.28 --> 01:01:06.24
screaming sometimes you might have to though you know you might need to get that information people

587
01:01:06.24 --> 01:01:09.36
are paying attention what you're saying it didn't be impactful if you've ever been sitting in

588
01:01:09.36 --> 01:01:14.08
it's in attack corporations and we hear people yelling it gets attention because most

589
01:01:14.08 --> 01:01:17.36
military guys don't yell in scream for no reason they're yelling in screaming because there's

590
01:01:17.36 --> 01:01:27.36
there's a reason why they're yelling in screaming don't recommend it i don't recommend it but

591
01:01:27.36 --> 01:01:33.36
i've heard it you know i prefer the calm guys if you got a yelling scream then calm down and

592
01:01:33.36 --> 01:01:36.40
talk about what you actually need you can't just continue yelling scream because you'll

593
01:01:37.28 --> 01:01:42.40
you won't get through clear communication you'll come off his office too emotional

594
01:01:43.76 --> 01:01:47.76
and you know you just become hard to understand what you're screaming yelling calm down

595
01:01:48.72 --> 01:01:54.80
get their attention give simple clear concise direction of what you want back to the book each

596
01:01:54.80 --> 01:01:58.64
and every man still alive on that field american and north Vietnamese was fighting for his life

597
01:01:59.68 --> 01:02:03.52
in the tall grass it was nearly impossible for the soldiers of either side to identify

598
01:02:03.52 --> 01:02:10.72
front or fro except it extremely close range americans in all of drab and north Vietnamese and

599
01:02:10.72 --> 01:02:18.000
mustard brown were fighting and dying side by side it may have begun as a meeting engagement a

600
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:24.000
hasty ambush a surprise attacked a battle of maneuver and in fact it was all those things but

601
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:30.72
within minutes the result was a wild melee a shootout with just gun fighters killing not only

602
01:02:30.72 --> 01:02:38.08
the enemy not only the enemy but sometimes their friends just a few feet away there would be no

603
01:02:38.08 --> 01:02:44.80
cheap victory here this day for either side there would be no victory at all just a horrible

604
01:02:44.80 --> 01:02:56.88
certainty of death in the tall grass unbelievable horrible

605
01:02:57.76 --> 01:03:04.96
horrible back to the book just for the headquarter section of the column Charlie company was beginning to die

606
01:03:06.72 --> 01:03:10.72
Charlie company talking about Charlie company a whole company of men 150 guys

607
01:03:10.72 --> 01:03:17.44
spec for jacksmith was with the lead elements in the Charlie company formation

608
01:03:18.08 --> 01:03:22.16
nearly tenet dawn cornet the acting company commander when the company charged into the

609
01:03:22.16 --> 01:03:26.72
teeth of the enemy machine guns in the first seconds smith saw one of the radio operators

610
01:03:26.72 --> 01:03:30.80
fall dead with a bullet through his chest his eyes and tongue bulging out

611
01:03:32.24 --> 01:03:37.84
the men of Charlie company were firing in all directions smith recalls within a span of perhaps

612
01:03:37.84 --> 01:03:45.76
20 minutes everyone around me was dead or wounded except me you have to understand that an

613
01:03:45.76 --> 01:03:51.60
area the elephant grass was chest high once you hit the dirt your world was about as big as a

614
01:03:51.60 --> 01:03:59.04
dining room table your world's completely confined to that area and the six or seven men around you

615
01:04:00.32 --> 01:04:02.96
at that point we were isolated

616
01:04:02.96 --> 01:04:08.72
alpha company was in the same shape then the north Vietnamese swept through I believe they

617
01:04:08.72 --> 01:04:13.92
came between alpha and our company began to shoot people we didn't know if the noise was

618
01:04:13.92 --> 01:04:18.72
from five feet away as they began to shoot people was friendly or enemy

619
01:04:22.40 --> 01:04:27.52
smith saw soldiers take machine guns lie flat on the ground and begin firing into the grass

620
01:04:27.52 --> 01:04:33.28
often they were firing right into the muscles of other American machine guns people were

621
01:04:33.28 --> 01:04:37.84
screaming to stop the shooting it began to have all the elements of a massacre

622
01:04:39.60 --> 01:04:46.32
nobody was in control because all the officers were to the front and our radio operators had fallen dead

623
01:04:46.32 --> 01:04:56.48
on their radio sets no leadership no communication you know I talked to businesses that I

624
01:04:56.48 --> 01:05:01.44
explained this to my there's your point yeah it is loud and clear tell these businesses

625
01:05:01.44 --> 01:05:04.64
were like going talk to businesses they talk about this problem and that problem the other problem

626
01:05:04.64 --> 01:05:08.48
the problem is leadership that's the problem is the problem is leadership

627
01:05:11.92 --> 01:05:16.72
and the situation like this where the leaders are not there to lead you've got serious problems

628
01:05:16.72 --> 01:05:22.000
on your hands especially once again if you haven't trained people to lead to step up and lead

629
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.28
when the leader's gone if you haven't trained people to do that you're gonna have problems no one is

630
01:05:27.28 --> 01:05:33.28
going to lead

631
01:05:36.16 --> 01:05:43.36
back to the book pain fought the north Vietnamese had done a much much better job of anticipating

632
01:05:43.36 --> 01:05:48.64
and preparing for the attack but the Americans who survived the initial onslaught began to rally

633
01:05:48.64 --> 01:05:53.92
in one respect you could think of it as little big horn we were surrounded with our

634
01:05:53.92 --> 01:05:59.84
packs in front of us shooting it out during the course of that long afternoon I never saw

635
01:05:59.84 --> 01:06:07.92
soldier not do his duty I never saw anyone who cowered in the face of the enemy our backs were

636
01:06:07.92 --> 01:06:13.76
against the wall and it was a matter of survival every person I saw rose to the occasion so this is

637
01:06:13.76 --> 01:06:22.56
the American troopers are doing what American troopers do fight even in these terrible

638
01:06:22.56 --> 01:06:30.72
situation no one cowers no one stands down back to the book shortly after word the command came

639
01:06:30.72 --> 01:06:36.16
over the batangin net throw smoke lieutenant Gwen moved a little way into the grass and the

640
01:06:36.16 --> 01:06:43.52
men in Albany perimeter all began to throw smoke grenades I saw skip fuzzmire Charlie company commander

641
01:06:43.52 --> 01:06:49.44
throwing smoke I had no idea what the hell he was doing up here our perimeter was marked with colors

642
01:06:49.44 --> 01:06:55.04
with all colors of smoke delineating our positions and shortly after the air strikes started

643
01:06:57.12 --> 01:07:04.88
they were the they were eight one east sky raiders with napom the first napom canisters fell

644
01:07:04.88 --> 01:07:09.20
right at the point where sajini's and i had left the jungle and came into the clearing

645
01:07:09.20 --> 01:07:14.56
we could see masses of north Vietnamese on the other side I was sure I was very sure they were

646
01:07:14.56 --> 01:07:19.28
going to come across at us I think they were cleaning up over there shooting down at the ground

647
01:07:19.28 --> 01:07:26.000
dispatching our wounded that first strike was right on target with two napom cans I saw them hit

648
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.68
the tops of the trees and jelly napom was coming down through the limbs and the NVA were jumping

649
01:07:31.68 --> 01:07:40.88
trying to get away and being engulfed in flames I saw that time and time again lieutenant Gwen

650
01:07:40.88 --> 01:07:47.52
remembers it cleaned out swath after swath those fuckers would jump up and try to run they didn't

651
01:07:47.52 --> 01:07:53.04
make it by now the Americans were cheering and laughing at each strike the cheering stop when they

652
01:07:53.04 --> 01:07:57.44
dropped two canisters directly onto the position where the remnants of the second platoon had been

653
01:07:57.44 --> 01:08:03.52
making their stand it might have been me but all I could hear was the cracking of unexpected

654
01:08:03.52 --> 01:08:13.36
rounds burning in the flames that engulfed our men none of us know if there were any alive at the time

655
01:08:13.36 --> 01:08:26.24
but none of us wanted to think about it

656
01:08:30.96 --> 01:08:36.48
spec for dick acumen of the recompletun remembers our artillery was supporting us so close that we

657
01:08:36.48 --> 01:08:42.64
would occasionally get some shrapnel there were planes flying close air support we started digging in

658
01:08:42.64 --> 01:08:47.76
everywhere we could my entrenching tool was attached to my pack left out in the clearing so I used my

659
01:08:47.76 --> 01:08:53.60
band at my fingers and someone else is too old when it was available the comfort of a trench just

660
01:08:53.60 --> 01:09:01.12
big enough to hold your body is unbelievable no more than 200 yards away in that tortured column

661
01:09:01.12 --> 01:09:06.48
of desperate Americans one man prayed for a miracle and the US Air Force delivered it

662
01:09:06.48 --> 01:09:15.52
pfc Jim shaden delta company who had booby trapped his own body with a hand grenade was badly wounded

663
01:09:15.52 --> 01:09:21.68
an unable unable to move he was directly in the path of a group of north Vietnamese soldiers

664
01:09:21.68 --> 01:09:28.40
methodically sweeping the ground killing his wounded buddies then here's what he says

665
01:09:28.40 --> 01:09:34.80
before the north Vietnamese got to me half a dozen of them a pilot came over at treetop level

666
01:09:34.80 --> 01:09:39.68
level turned straight up and dropped the canister of napalm dead center on them

667
01:09:40.80 --> 01:09:47.92
i never cease to be a mage amazed at the accuracy of that drop the heat of the napalm rolled across

668
01:09:47.92 --> 01:09:56.16
my face and body like an open door on a furnace i owe this pilot more than it is possibly possible

669
01:09:56.16 --> 01:10:11.84
for a human to pay may god bless all pilots now we hear from captain abuse tally's

670
01:10:11.84 --> 01:10:17.68
bravo company first battalion fifth cavalry was a was assigned the mission of attacking

671
01:10:17.68 --> 01:10:21.52
to relieve the pressure and attempt to link up with the beleaguered battalion

672
01:10:21.52 --> 01:10:27.76
refreend forcements were also on the way for the battalion command perimeter at the head of the

673
01:10:27.76 --> 01:10:34.80
column during the afternoon captain miranda dyrics battle weary veterans of the fight at

674
01:10:34.80 --> 01:10:40.88

676
01:10:48.40 --> 01:10:53.76

677
01:10:53.76 --> 01:11:00.32
hollow a were stunned when they were told they were being thrown back into a desperate situation

678
01:11:00.32 --> 01:11:07.20
so suddenly so if you remember did gyric from podcast 105 from 270's bravo company 27 they

679
01:11:07.20 --> 01:11:16.24
went in and helped turn the situation around at lz x-ray they fought hard and then they got extracted

680
01:11:16.24 --> 01:11:21.84
and now they're getting told there's a bad situation going on again and we need to put you back

690
01:12:27.20 --> 01:12:33.44
quickly throwing on their harnesses no protests but their eyes filled with disbelief again

691
01:12:33.44 --> 01:12:40.80
dyric then issued the the shortest frag order in bravo company history will be landing

with one side of the landing zone held by the north Vietnamese sit rep from the ground grim

694
01:12:53.68 --> 01:12:56.88
expect to be sandwiched between friendly and enemy fires

695
01:12:56.88 --> 01:13:06.32
at about 545 p.m. rest scorela gathered the patoons they pressed in close listening

across the field the first lift ships were sweeping in head him up captain direct grout

702
01:13:54.24 --> 01:14:01.04
I turned and walked ahead fantino trailing with the PRC 25 the road stretched out past the

703
01:14:01.04 --> 01:14:08.16
permanent hooches of the rear echelon at hallaway word spread that we were on a suicide fight

704
01:14:08.16 --> 01:14:17.28
tumbling out of cozy bunks hallways finest line the road to watch us depart Hawaiian shirts,

705
01:14:17.28 --> 01:14:24.88
aviator shades jeans, beer cans and hands cooks and bottle washers the shit burgers,

01:14:24.88 --> 01:14:34.72
projectionists club runners same army different species the company picked up pace a tight

707
01:14:34.72 --> 01:14:43.04
dirty brown column a few of the men carried eight k's trophies from x-ray no one had shaved noted

708
01:14:43.04 --> 01:14:50.80
risk orla but our weapon sparkled one out fit are you one spectator asked the hard core of

709
01:14:50.80 --> 01:14:58.24
bravo company second of the seventh where you headed to kick ass a yelled back a deep rumble ran

710
01:14:58.24 --> 01:15:04.88
through the ranks men yelling cursing not a man among us with swap places with these

711
01:15:04.88 --> 01:15:13.20
lardasses as we passed I asked fantino how we looking back there his reply no straggler sir

712
01:15:13.84 --> 01:15:20.80
every swing and dick is with us as we made a column right to the pickup point I looked back at our crew

713
01:15:20.80 --> 01:15:26.88
no outfit in the army had ever rendered a route step any better than these men at this moment

714
01:15:28.48 --> 01:15:34.16
we piled on to the huge without the usual loading instructions and skated away into the fading gray light

715
01:15:36.48 --> 01:15:43.12
at 645 p.m. the first lift ships roared into the small Albany clearing and captain to

716
01:15:43.12 --> 01:15:51.20
direct troopers bailed out into the tall grass the cavalry had ridden to the rescue but the killing

717
01:15:51.20 --> 01:15:57.52
and dying and terror continued unbated inside the american perimeter as the long night began

718
01:16:02.64 --> 01:16:09.84
once again that's the american soldier right there barely survived x-ray get called to go back in

719
01:16:09.84 --> 01:16:21.44
and they pick up the pace back to the book captain to direct road of the flight in in the situation

720
01:16:21.44 --> 01:16:26.80
on the ground assaulting Albany we picked up five bullet holes in the helicopter things were bad

721
01:16:26.80 --> 01:16:32.000
I found out what I landed that the battalion was shot up pretty bad so we came in the nica time

722
01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:38.08
to their rescue the main part of second battalion seventh calves was on their last ditch standard Albany

723
01:16:38.08 --> 01:16:47.76
little big horn revisited and here's rescor la talking looking sideways I saw trickle of blood

724
01:16:47.76 --> 01:16:53.04
down the pilot sleeve this is as they're flying in the choppers drop the few feet the pilot

725
01:16:53.04 --> 01:16:58.56
yelled at the gunner the gunner snalled get out I hesitated get the fuck out four of us dropped the

726
01:16:58.56 --> 01:17:06.72
bone-jarring ten feet now inside the battalion command group perimeter rescor la took stock

727
01:17:06.72 --> 01:17:12.88
here's what he says the battalion sergeant major sat against the tree with a bandits chest we got hit

728
01:17:12.88 --> 01:17:18.96
bad sir real bad the wounded were gathered thirty yards from the CP only half my platoon

729
01:17:18.96 --> 01:17:24.96
hit arrived the other ships turned back because the ground fire in darkness the perimeter was an

730
01:17:24.96 --> 01:17:30.16
oval island of trees three platoons could man the perimeter but with the exception of our people

731
01:17:30.16 --> 01:17:37.04
and pat pains recomplatoon there was no unit cohesion Colonel McDades slumped against the tree

732
01:17:37.04 --> 01:17:42.80
he looked exhausted he was exceptionally silent major frank Henry has executive officer was

733
01:17:42.80 --> 01:17:48.48
reassuring the active a short fire plug of a man Henry waved a welcome working the radios

734
01:17:49.28 --> 01:17:54.72
captain Jill Price the fire support coordinated coordinator crouch beside him

735
01:17:54.72 --> 01:17:59.76
clumps of survivors sprawled inside the perimeter including several company commanders

736
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.80
lieutenant Larry go in watched the reinforcements arrive I saw Rick rescor la

737
01:18:06.80 --> 01:18:12.16
comes swaggering into our lines with a smile on his face an m seventy nine on his shoulder

738
01:18:12.16 --> 01:18:18.32
and his m sixteen in one hand saying good good good I hope they hit us with everything they've got

739
01:18:18.32 --> 01:18:26.96
tonight will wipe them up his spirit was catching the troops were cheering his each load came in

740
01:18:26.96 --> 01:18:31.60
and we really raised a racket the enemy must have fought that an entire battalion was coming

741
01:18:31.60 --> 01:18:40.000
to help because of all our screaming and yelling major Henry directed that I round up some men

742
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:46.56
and police all the ammo resupply which the choppers brought in on the last flight it was lying

743
01:18:46.56 --> 01:18:51.76
and crates on the far side of the lz somehow we got it all into the perimeter as I came back with

744
01:18:51.76 --> 01:18:56.32
the last load I passed right over the body of that northeastern east side killed early in the flight

745
01:18:57.68 --> 01:19:08.48
there wasn't much of them left and I didn't give a damn so I mean there you go there you see one

746
01:19:08.48 --> 01:19:14.16
one leader makes a difference one leader makes a difference here these guys are completely surrounded

747
01:19:14.16 --> 01:19:20.08
dead and wounded everywhere and Rick Resscorla comes in and says good I hope they bring it tonight

748
01:19:20.08 --> 01:19:27.92
will wipe them out back to the book lieutenant pat pain of the recompleton was just as happy

749
01:19:27.92 --> 01:19:32.48
about the reinforcements as Quinn we were all very surprised to see those helicopters come in

750
01:19:33.36 --> 01:19:38.08
we were only securing one side of the lz so when the guys would jump off the helicopter we

751
01:19:38.08 --> 01:19:43.92
halted them which way to come I had a feeling we had actually been rescued that in the fact that

752
01:19:43.92 --> 01:19:49.76
the cavalry had arrived just like in the movies I admired the courage it took to land in all the

753
01:19:49.76 --> 01:19:55.84
knee lieutenant Resscorla was one of the best combat leaders I ever saw during two tours in Vietnam

754
01:19:55.84 --> 01:20:00.16
he walked around and pepped everyone up by telling them they'd done a good job that there was

755
01:20:00.16 --> 01:20:06.08
support now that things were under control he never raised his voice almost spoken of whisper

756
01:20:06.08 --> 01:20:15.04
we were awfully glad to see him and the others from bravo company we got in there until

757
01:20:15.04 --> 01:20:22.32
every hour you did a good job didn't get all negative although he's actually and he talks about it

758
01:20:22.32 --> 01:20:26.40
I think I think I'm going to cover it but he talks about what he was actually thinking was like

759
01:20:26.40 --> 01:20:32.000
this is going to be really problematic in his mind he was thinking this is bad really bad but he didn't

760
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:40.08
show that he showed hey we're good bring it you're you're good now good job get ready to get it on

761
01:20:43.52 --> 01:20:49.36
talking a little bit about the the air support that they're getting back to the book chief worn

762
01:20:49.36 --> 01:20:54.72
officer Hank Ainsworth had been overhead in the second baton command chopper all day and here's what

763
01:20:54.72 --> 01:21:00.24
he says I was overhead when the fight started and orbited overhead to late that night I was on a

764
01:21:00.24 --> 01:21:07.12
freak talking to a major frank Henry later that evening he called me Henry said we have critically

765
01:21:07.12 --> 01:21:12.32
wounded down here if we don't get them out they're going to die I called met a back and they came out

766
01:21:12.32 --> 01:21:19.68
made a pass drew fire and refused to land to land Frank Henry knew exactly what to do about

767
01:21:19.68 --> 01:21:26.16
that situation he told Hank Ainsworth to call the 229th Huey slicks the old reliables

768
01:21:26.16 --> 01:21:33.52
Ainsworth notified the 229th pilots told them that L's Y Albany was hot but that second baton

769
01:21:33.52 --> 01:21:38.32
seventh cavalry had critically wounded men who would die if they were not evacuated

770
01:21:39.28 --> 01:21:45.60
says Ainsworth the whole damn unit volunteered I told them we only needed two ships

771
01:21:46.64 --> 01:21:52.000
despite Ainsworth's call for only two ships four Huey slicks lifted off from camp all the way

772
01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.92
Turkey farm at 950pm for the 40 minute flight to Albany Captain Bob Stinette was again in the

773
01:21:57.92 --> 01:22:04.88
lead followed by a Captain Bruce Thomas chief one officer Ken Faba and war officer Robert Mason

774
01:22:06.48 --> 01:22:10.80
and here's what Stinette says normally the Huey pilots thought I'll back their engine

775
01:22:10.80 --> 01:22:18.000
as soon as they touched down to conserve you will fuel not tonight something told me not to do that

776
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:24.08
to keep the engine turning at a full flight to RPMs they told us the wounded were ambulatory

777
01:22:24.08 --> 01:22:28.80
when we got in there they were all stretcher cases my crew chief and gunner had to get out and

778
01:22:28.80 --> 01:22:34.24
raise the seats so we could get all the stretchers in then all hell broke loose fire was coming

779
01:22:34.24 --> 01:22:39.76
in from everywhere I immediately pitched I immediately pulled pitched and with the RPMs at flight

780
01:22:39.76 --> 01:22:45.52
the ship instantly jumped 30 feet in the air and kept going up we went so fast that the crew

781
01:22:45.52 --> 01:22:50.08
chief and gunner got left behind on the ground and I didn't even know it we just flat left them

782
01:22:50.72 --> 01:22:56.56
we had the wounded inside when we got back we counted 30 holes in my machine that was enough

783
01:22:56.56 --> 01:23:03.52
for me and my Huey the lift of three that went in after dawn after me took in medical stuff

784
01:23:03.52 --> 01:23:09.76
and brought back more wounded and my crew major Frank Henry was on the flashlight at the time

785
01:23:09.76 --> 01:23:17.44
Joel Sajini's watched it with all the brave aviators wrist everything for the wounded at all

786
01:23:17.44 --> 01:23:22.72
the knee I remember thinking they were the bravest pilots I had ever seen they were sitting ducks

787
01:23:22.72 --> 01:23:28.48
and I fully expected to see them shot down at any moment they were guided in by Frank Henry

788
01:23:28.48 --> 01:23:34.80
you could see the tracers the aircraft didn't hesitate it a bit they landed loaded and were gone

789
01:23:34.80 --> 01:23:42.32
in seconds so again you see what that's the American flighting spirit oh we got a hot LZ

790
01:23:42.32 --> 01:23:46.40
where we're probably gonna get shot down but we've got wounded Americans on the ground we're going

791
01:23:46.40 --> 01:23:52.16
to get them everyone in the unit volunteers we only need two aircraft guess what we're bringing for

792
01:23:52.16 --> 01:24:03.44
back to the book after midnight several shots rang out from inside the perimeter a

793
01:24:03.44 --> 01:24:09.60
trooper 20 yards behind risk gorilla inside the perimeter had rattled off a panicky three rounds

794
01:24:09.60 --> 01:24:14.32
risk gorilla walked back and cost out the group in the middle of perimeter if I hear one more

795
01:24:14.32 --> 01:24:19.68
round out of you we'll turn our weapons around and open up no one fires from inside the perimeter

796
01:24:19.68 --> 01:24:24.48
if you want to fire out to the perimeter if you want to fire get out to the perimeter line

797
01:24:25.28 --> 01:24:29.52
whispered communication took place all night between isolated elements outside the perimeter

798
01:24:29.52 --> 01:24:34.16
if there was heroism it was out there in the tiny groups of wounded and those who had

799
01:24:34.16 --> 01:24:40.000
bandaged and protected them through the night they were just like hunting buddies said risk gorilla

800
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:46.16
surviving by instinct looking out for each other lieutenant Larry going a valve company recalls

801
01:24:46.16 --> 01:24:51.84
that late that night one of Alpha's missing men crawled into the American perimeter here's what he

802
01:24:51.84 --> 01:24:58.80
says sergeant James a malarty from our first platoon made it back to our lines his story the

803
01:24:58.80 --> 01:25:04.80
NVA had been shooting our wounded one came up to him stuck a pistol in his mouth and fired

804
01:25:05.60 --> 01:25:09.92
the bullet exited through the back of his throat knocked him out and they left him for dead

805
01:25:09.92 --> 01:25:15.52
he survived and when he woke up that night he started crawling to us

806
01:25:20.48 --> 01:25:25.60
the next day was a real nightmare as we went out to find our dead in missing

807
01:25:26.48 --> 01:25:31.84
I think each of us cracked up a little bit that day as the true picture of the action began to unfold

808
01:25:32.88 --> 01:25:38.96
then it came across the radio Bravo company had found another survivor from our second platoon

809
01:25:38.96 --> 01:25:44.56
he had been badly wounded in the legs and it prop himself up against a tree he had been

810
01:25:44.56 --> 01:25:49.76
burned by napalm waiting in the night and some north Vietnamese had put a pistol to his eye and pulled the

811
01:25:49.76 --> 01:25:59.28
trigger shot him in the eye blinded him but he was still alive I saw him being brought in by

812
01:25:59.28 --> 01:26:08.40
stretcher smoking a cigarette all fucked up so at this point things had backed off a little bit they

813
01:26:08.40 --> 01:26:14.88
backed off and they actually did the madmen it which is something that Hacworth talks about

814
01:26:14.88 --> 01:26:20.88
and it's something that they did in the first part of this book which is hey everyone in the

815
01:26:20.88 --> 01:26:26.64
perimeter is just going to shoot a bunch of rounds like at 630 in the morning boom everyone fire a

816
01:26:26.64 --> 01:26:35.84
full load out or a full magazine or a couple magazines at likely targets and they did that and

817
01:26:35.84 --> 01:26:40.56
that seemed to calm things down they kind of did that once things had already calm down a little bit

818
01:26:41.84 --> 01:26:49.52
and it was it was it indicated that maybe things were calming down a little here's another thing

819
01:26:49.52 --> 01:26:53.76
back to the book the NBA came into the ambush area that night to recover their dead wounded

820
01:26:53.76 --> 01:26:59.20
when they found any of our guys alive they would beat them to death bayonet them or machete

821
01:26:59.20 --> 01:27:07.68
them to avoid shooting and drawing fire from us that was during the night they did that like I

822
01:27:07.68 --> 01:27:12.56
said they did the madmen and here's what here's what Lieutenant Riscordla said about the madmen

823
01:27:12.56 --> 01:27:17.76
and he said this decision was regrettable rifle fire shattered the silence and the perimeter

824
01:27:17.76 --> 01:27:23.60
was wring with reckless firing little fought had been given to that the remainder of our survivors

825
01:27:23.60 --> 01:27:29.44
were sprawled among the trees and ant hills within 500 yards the effective range of RM16s what the

826
01:27:29.44 --> 01:27:36.24
fuck is happening are you shooting at us the frantic radio call started coming in how many troops were

827
01:27:36.24 --> 01:27:42.96
killed or injured by our wake up call will never be known thank God for the trees the ant hills

828
01:27:42.96 --> 01:27:52.72
and the uneven terrain captain Dudley to Demy third brigade fire support coordinator remembers flying

829
01:27:52.72 --> 01:27:59.76
out to Albany at first light the next morning Tim Brown myself Mickey Parrish took a while to get through

830
01:27:59.76 --> 01:28:05.68
the smoke hanging over the whole area not much had really taken place in terms of policing the area

831
01:28:05.68 --> 01:28:12.96
the image is still vivid in my mind is the carnage folks were still sitting around in a days

832
01:28:12.96 --> 01:28:19.44
they hadn't done much had even taken ponchos and covered up these bodies I could handle the

833
01:28:19.44 --> 01:28:26.64
conversation I could handle grown men crying but we were talking 12 hours later sitting there

834
01:28:26.64 --> 01:28:32.48
feeling sorry for themselves Colonel Brown was very pissed off even if you do get caught in a bad

835
01:28:32.48 --> 01:28:40.08
situation you have to do something to recover it was young kids who paid the price in later years

836
01:28:40.08 --> 01:28:45.76
I used to stress that to my young battery commanders it isn't us who die in combat it's those young

837
01:28:45.76 --> 01:28:52.96
kids who die those kids we are responsible for training and leading it's our job to get the job done

838
01:28:52.96 --> 01:29:09.36
and get those kids home safe and here they're wrapping up this again now this the battle turned and

839
01:29:09.36 --> 01:29:20.40
really the Vietnamese left after the massive air strikes it started and here's another image of the

840
01:29:20.40 --> 01:29:27.84
cleanup back to the book specialist for John Molinas of Bravo Company second battalion seventh

841
01:29:27.84 --> 01:29:34.16
cavalry mortapal tune and most of the rest of Djeric's men were involved in this macabre depressing

842
01:29:34.16 --> 01:29:42.000
duty it was incredible carnage we went into areas where lots of artillery had come in during the night

843
01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:48.64
and we saw our guys have been blown up in the trees the bodies were already decomposed and it only

844
01:29:48.64 --> 01:29:57.84
happened night before we were in shock it was the first last and only time I ever saw anything like it

845
01:29:57.84 --> 01:30:07.28
and I pray never again the stench was unbelievable we started hauling in the whole body's first

846
01:30:07.28 --> 01:30:16.88
then we brought in the pieces and parts two chinooks came in and we loaded one with about 20 corpses

847
01:30:16.88 --> 01:30:23.52
neatly arranged in lids the pilot began preparing to take off one of our officers pointed

848
01:30:23.52 --> 01:30:30.64
M16 at the pilot told him to keep the board on the ground we weren't through bodies were loaded

849
01:30:30.64 --> 01:30:40.96
floor to ceiling when the ramp finally closed blood poured through the hinges I felt sorry for the

850
01:30:40.96 --> 01:30:49.44
poor bastards who would have to unload this chopper back at Holloway the nightmares

851
01:30:49.44 --> 01:31:09.92
born of this battle have never faded the final division headquarters account

852
01:31:09.92 --> 01:31:19.76
reported that the two seven alpha and bravo companies and the one five battalion suffered

853
01:31:19.76 --> 01:31:33.92
151 men killed an action 121 wounded and four missing in action and on April 6th 1966 so

854
01:31:33.92 --> 01:31:41.84
quite some months later how more who was at that time had become the third brigade commander

855
01:31:41.84 --> 01:31:46.80
went back to lz all been he and recovered the bodies of all four members of two seven who were

856
01:31:49.52 --> 01:31:55.92
brought back on a hero and began the long journey home to America

857
01:31:55.92 --> 01:32:10.24
now this was as I said kind of the the tipping point in the Vietnam war and this

858
01:32:11.28 --> 01:32:19.20
battle had a impact strategically one thing that came from this battle and I'll talk about a

859
01:32:19.20 --> 01:32:24.24
little bit more in the book but the body count came back and the body count came back

860
01:32:24.24 --> 01:32:32.24
basically as 10 to one maybe 12 to one so for every 10 or 12 north Vietnamese soldier that was dead

861
01:32:33.84 --> 01:32:42.72
there was only one American killed and our generals liked that ratio they thought hey you know

862
01:32:42.72 --> 01:32:52.08
we we can win a war of attrition and one of the comments that comes in in the book

863
01:32:52.08 --> 01:32:59.60
as they go back and an interview general jayap who's the the senior general of the north

864
01:32:59.60 --> 01:33:02.80
Vietnamese army he's got a book actually we're going to do in the podcast at some point

865
01:33:04.96 --> 01:33:11.44
he's the mastermind of a strategy and he said we thought that the Americans must have a strategy

866
01:33:12.56 --> 01:33:20.72
we did we had the strategy of a people's war no part of what that means is that

867
01:33:20.72 --> 01:33:25.76
the strategy of the people's war means we're going to suffer some casualties and we're okay with that

868
01:33:27.04 --> 01:33:32.40
so our strategy of saying well we'll get them into a war of attrition they're okay with it they don't care

869
01:33:33.36 --> 01:33:39.52
human life has less human human life has less value for them at this time they the commander

870
01:33:39.52 --> 01:33:44.56
sure's held in care you know we talked about that last time they're losing guys on the from malaria on the

871
01:33:44.56 --> 01:33:53.76
trail you're going to lose five sick guys they don't care they've got a war to win so talking

872
01:33:53.76 --> 01:34:00.32
about some of the other sort of strategic things or strategic implications from this

873
01:34:06.88 --> 01:34:11.44
night nineteen sixty seven so this is a couple years later back to the book in mid-december

874
01:34:11.44 --> 01:34:16.48
president Johnson convened a white house meeting of his top advisors will bungee says that

875
01:34:16.48 --> 01:34:21.68
McNamara's option number one get the hell out of Vietnam now while the getting is good was never

876
01:34:21.68 --> 01:34:29.12
seriously considered nor was it pressed by McNamara option number two the huge build of

877
01:34:29.12 --> 01:34:34.08
of the American combat and support troops was readily approved by all including McNamara

878
01:34:34.08 --> 01:34:42.000
ever the numbers cruncher McNamara told the gathering the military solution to the problem is not

879
01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:47.12
certain the odds of success are one out of three or one out of two

880
01:34:49.76 --> 01:34:56.56
McNamara did push for a bombing post prepare US opinion public opinion for the coming escalation so

881
01:34:56.56 --> 01:35:03.28
again well I'm sure at some point in this podcast we will dive deep into the

882
01:35:04.16 --> 01:35:10.88
political manipulation the political decision making that happened during the Vietnam War but

883
01:35:10.88 --> 01:35:17.36
this is this is what they're talking about it's interesting here McNamara even back in 1967

884
01:35:17.36 --> 01:35:21.44
to say in how we got like a one in three maybe one in two odds of winning

885
01:35:21.44 --> 01:35:27.44
this is not this is not this is not good odds we don't like those odds

886
01:35:33.20 --> 01:35:39.04
here's here's how more talking again back to the book in late June 1966 my turn was

887
01:35:39.04 --> 01:35:44.24
up as commander of the third brigade when my replacement a Colonel straight out of the pentagon

888
01:35:44.24 --> 01:35:49.28
showed up to take over my brigade was in the field fighting near Dong Tre it would have been

889
01:35:49.28 --> 01:35:54.32
criminal and those circumstances to relinquish my command to a two man who's still

890
01:35:54.32 --> 01:36:00.24
still pissing state side water and I flatly refused to do so the change of command was delayed

891
01:36:00.24 --> 01:36:06.88
ten days until the fight was over a month later on August 8th 1966 my replacement sent my

892
01:36:06.88 --> 01:36:12.16
replacement sent alpha company first battalion seventh cavalry back in the hydrying valley by itself

893
01:36:12.16 --> 01:36:20.16
and twenty five men were killed in one terrible day so not a good turn over situation

894
01:36:20.16 --> 01:36:24.24
again this is where this is where the beer you people always talk about when I talk with businesses

895
01:36:24.24 --> 01:36:28.32
they go we have a big bureaucracy here and you don't understand like no we understand the military

896
01:36:28.32 --> 01:36:35.44
understands peroxie better than anybody we probably got the biggest and most most firm

897
01:36:35.44 --> 01:36:42.40
in place bureaucracy in the world and this is part of it right here back to the book I

898
01:36:42.40 --> 01:36:46.56
hope that my next assignment would be to the infantry school at fort bending where I could pass

899
01:36:46.56 --> 01:36:51.60
along what I had learned in Vietnam for the young officers who are headed for combat it was not to be

900
01:36:51.60 --> 01:36:56.64
in fact only one of the hundreds of officers who had gone through air mobile training and a year

901
01:36:56.64 --> 01:37:02.48
in the field with the first cavalry division was assigned to the infantry school I was sent

902
01:37:02.48 --> 01:37:08.000
instead to Washington DC where I was told my next job would be Latin American desk at the U.S. State

903
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:15.44
Department this is this is an embarrassment right here's this guy basically created or helped

904
01:37:15.44 --> 01:37:23.76
create or helped test the the idea of air mobile helicopter assaults and then he did it for a year

905
01:37:23.76 --> 01:37:29.20
in the field commanded at the battalion and that the brigade level and instead of putting him in

906
01:37:29.20 --> 01:37:34.000
the infantry school or he could teach the stuff that he learned they send him to be the the

907
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:40.88
Latin American desk and I'll tell you what's awesome this was awesome when I was in the

908
01:37:40.88 --> 01:37:45.68
sealed teams I went to Romadi when I came home guess where I went I took over the west coast

909
01:37:45.68 --> 01:37:49.28
seal training for the for the guys that were getting ready to deploy right out of the casing

910
01:37:49.28 --> 01:37:55.04
I did what he wanted to do which is perfect and luckily we have the little a little less bureaucracy

911
01:37:55.04 --> 01:38:00.08
and I was able to talk to my boss and say hey this is what I should be doing see yeah you're right

912
01:38:01.04 --> 01:38:06.08
and put me in that position but it didn't happen and here's all this knowledge going and they said

913
01:38:06.08 --> 01:38:16.64
only one officer out of a hundred that's another thing like when you hear you know people on the

914
01:38:16.64 --> 01:38:20.32
business well they say what the military is this great organization the military has all kinds of

915
01:38:20.32 --> 01:38:27.04
problems military is no perfect no perfect example of the way to run things parts of it are

916
01:38:28.24 --> 01:38:32.000
but you can't look at the military to hold and say that that even remotely makes sense in any

917
01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.76
way shape or form and I could point a thousand things out to you today the military is the same way

918
01:38:35.76 --> 01:38:41.28
doing dumb stuff I mean it's a great organization there's got great people there's there's

919
01:38:41.28 --> 01:38:51.76
unbelievable leaders in there but there's also idiots the military is made up of people of human beings

920
01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:02.48
brilliant ones dumb ones back to the book for the next year I watched Bob McNamara

921
01:39:03.04 --> 01:39:08.000
and John McNott and both brilliant man go through hell as they struggled un-successfully to get

922
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:15.76
a handle on the war and the pacification progress and Vietnam at the end of that year neither of them

923
01:39:15.76 --> 01:39:23.52
was either neither of them was any closer to finding or creating such a handle an office wit

924
01:39:23.52 --> 01:39:31.12
summed up what was happening in Vietnam sadly and succinct although we have redouble our efforts

925
01:39:31.12 --> 01:39:39.04
we have lost sight of our objective so we're pouring all these troops in there

926
01:39:39.04 --> 01:39:44.96
pouring all this money in there put all this all these assets in there we've we've redoubled our

927
01:39:44.96 --> 01:39:53.04
efforts but we've lost sight of our objective back to the book what then had we learned with our

928
01:39:53.04 --> 01:39:58.88
sacrifices in the hydrating valley we had learned something about fighting the north Vietnamese

929
01:39:58.88 --> 01:40:04.72
regulars and something important about ourselves we could stand against the finest light infantry

930
01:40:04.72 --> 01:40:11.76
troops in the world and hold our ground general west moreland thought he had found the answer

931
01:40:11.76 --> 01:40:19.44
to the question of how to win this war he would train one American life for 10 or 11 or 12

932
01:40:19.44 --> 01:40:29.52
north Vietnamese lives day after day until Ho Chi Minh cried uncle west moreland would learn to late

933
01:40:31.20 --> 01:40:38.48
that he was wrong that the American people didn't see a kill ratio of 10 to one or even

934
01:40:38.48 --> 01:40:47.20
20 to one as any kind of bargain but we had validated both the principle and the practice of air

935
01:40:47.20 --> 01:40:54.80
mobile warfare a million American soldiers would ride to battle in Huey helicopters for the next

936
01:40:54.80 --> 01:41:01.84
eight years and the familiar whoop whoop of their rotors would be the enduring soundtrack of this war

937
01:41:04.72 --> 01:41:12.08
finally even though it took 10 years cost the lives of 58,000 young Americans and

938
01:41:12.08 --> 01:41:18.000
afflicted humiliating defeat on a nation that had never before lost a war some of us learned

939
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:29.04
that cause vets had it right 150 years earlier when he wrote these words no one starts a war

940
01:41:30.08 --> 01:41:38.24
or rather no one in his senses ought to do so without first being clear in his mind what he

941
01:41:38.24 --> 01:41:43.92
intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it

942
01:41:43.92 --> 01:41:57.36
class with

943
01:41:58.56 --> 01:42:08.64
be clear in your mind in what you intend to achieve

944
01:42:08.64 --> 01:42:19.12
no what you are going to do that doesn't seem like too much to ask certainly in war

945
01:42:25.28 --> 01:42:31.44
and you wouldn't think it would be too much for people to ask in their lives either

946
01:42:31.44 --> 01:42:44.96
their precious lives as precious as these 58,000 that died in Vietnam heroes

947
01:42:48.40 --> 01:42:54.24
but how often do we see people going through their lives without knowing what they are trying

948
01:42:54.24 --> 01:43:02.88
to do without having any intent without having a clear mission I'm talking on an individual level

949
01:43:03.92 --> 01:43:12.32
as a person people go through their lives without knowing what it is they want to do

950
01:43:13.28 --> 01:43:14.88
what they want to accomplish

951
01:43:14.88 --> 01:43:32.80
so no what your mission is no what you're intent as the commander of your life

952
01:43:32.80 --> 01:43:46.96
no what your intent is and then fight with everything you've got to win

953
01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:54.80
and I think that's all I've got for tonight so

954
01:43:54.80 --> 01:44:02.40
echo maybe if you want to shed some light on how people can

955
01:44:04.16 --> 01:44:11.52
maybe help themselves when that war and maybe support the podcast if they want to

956
01:44:11.52 --> 01:44:20.88
they want to that point though in my opinion is it good it's a good one it's a good one

957
01:44:20.88 --> 01:44:25.44
I think about people go through their lives and they're trying to do yeah and it sounds the same thing

958
01:44:25.44 --> 01:44:28.48
is going to war without knowing what they are coming supposed to be

959
01:44:28.48 --> 01:44:37.92
yeah you go but it sounds kind of like obvious when you say it you know like hey go through

960
01:44:39.52 --> 01:44:44.64
when you go through life should you have a goal real obvious yes you're not going to say no you

961
01:44:44.64 --> 01:44:49.84
shouldn't have a goal kind of thing so it seems obvious but you know how you live day to day

962
01:44:49.84 --> 01:44:54.48
you you know you might have a goal for the day maybe two maybe three but Brad life is four

963
01:44:54.48 --> 01:45:00.16
life is a full spectrum stuff well again it's so shocking because what you're saying is

964
01:45:00.16 --> 01:45:04.32
absolutely true you wouldn't think that people would be going through life without knowing

965
01:45:04.32 --> 01:45:09.36
where they're trying to get to yeah but you wouldn't think that a nation would go to war

966
01:45:09.36 --> 01:45:14.000
without clear intention of where they want to end up and how they're going to get there at

967
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.40
least an idea how you're going to get there now I have a little bit of like when claustrophic says

968
01:45:18.40 --> 01:45:23.36
how you're going to conduct the war that's not necessarily true because you don't know you can't

969
01:45:23.36 --> 01:45:27.52
know how you're going to conduct a war before the war starts you can have an idea but you can't

970
01:45:27.52 --> 01:45:32.80
know fully just like if you were to say hey my goal is to ex in my life you don't know how you're

971
01:45:32.80 --> 01:45:37.92
going to be able to do that yeah because you're going to you're going to make it adaptation things

972
01:45:37.92 --> 01:45:41.68
are going to come up things are going to change the battlefield changes your life changes things

973
01:45:41.68 --> 01:45:46.72
pop up I mean things happen so I think that that idea that you're going to know how you're

974
01:45:46.72 --> 01:45:53.12
going to execute something is is far fetched I think you what actually I should use the word idea

975
01:45:53.12 --> 01:45:56.48
you should have an idea of how you're going to do it yeah you should have an idea like okay well this

976
01:45:56.48 --> 01:46:02.08
is what I need to get done this is what I want to achieve in my life I want to make I want to do this

977
01:46:03.76 --> 01:46:09.20
what's a simple one I want to own a house that's a simple one that's a good place to start

978
01:46:09.20 --> 01:46:14.48
I want to own a house okay well let's think about how we're going to get there you know that's

979
01:46:14.48 --> 01:46:19.12
let's let's think about how we're going to get there you have to build your credit you have to

980
01:46:19.12 --> 01:46:22.32
you have to borrow money some people something they go to buy a house they've never borrowed money before

981
01:46:22.32 --> 01:46:25.20
you can't borrow money if you've never borrowed money you can't borrow money for a house if you've

982
01:46:25.20 --> 01:46:30.72
never borrowed money for a car or a or some smaller object before so you got to establish your credit

983
01:46:30.72 --> 01:46:34.40
then you got to have two years worth of income then you got to have a big fat down payment sitting

984
01:46:34.40 --> 01:46:39.04
ready so there's things you got to do this thing now now that might change a long way the idea is

985
01:46:39.04 --> 01:46:43.12
that you got to move towards that goal but that's what was so nice about hearing the V in the

986
01:46:43.12 --> 01:46:49.76
Mese commanders intent get close split them up boom you go make that happen hey guess what you want

987
01:46:49.76 --> 01:46:54.88
to buy a house one day save money have good credit yeah okay well you got to make money how you

988
01:46:54.88 --> 01:47:00.40
make money you might make it drive an Uber you might make it deliver in pizza you might make it you got

989
01:47:00.40 --> 01:47:03.68
your real job but that's important your family but then you need a little extra to throw in there

990
01:47:03.68 --> 01:47:06.88
that's why you end up driving Uber you end up with whatever you're going to do you want to make

991
01:47:06.88 --> 01:47:13.60
your you're some money on the side that you can start stashing away yeah and at the end of the day you

992
01:47:13.60 --> 01:47:20.24
do have that goal you know so it is yeah how you conduct yourself it's not going to be cut in

993
01:47:20.24 --> 01:47:25.36
drive for sure but you know in these examples like you know you want a buy house that's a goal

994
01:47:25.36 --> 01:47:29.84
that's just physical but that's just one teeny tiny goal in life if you're on of course you're

995
01:47:29.84 --> 01:47:33.92
not going to run into somebody who they're only goal in life is to buy a house no no no it's

996
01:47:33.92 --> 01:47:39.12
I said it's a one yeah it's like a don't buy house it's stupid you should rent things that's fine

997
01:47:39.12 --> 01:47:42.32
yeah I'm not telling everyone what they're going to should be and if you want to keep renting

998
01:47:42.32 --> 01:47:47.76
keep renting maybe that's for you yeah yeah yeah yeah not for me yeah but maybe it's for you there's

999
01:47:47.76 --> 01:47:51.20
other things you want to put your money that's cool you're doing some other something else smart with

1000
01:47:51.20 --> 01:47:57.36
your money yeah like buying rooms or something like that either way though if you

1001
01:47:57.36 --> 01:48:04.56
uh consider like just what went um closet closet it tell you see what what he's saying

1002
01:48:04.56 --> 01:48:08.96
and compared to life right where buying house sure that's one of many goals you're going to

1003
01:48:08.96 --> 01:48:14.000
have in life because life is full like was it but so it kind of when you really think about it

1004
01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:19.84
but it's hard it's hard to like designate some specific goals and then that's all you're going to

1005
01:48:19.84 --> 01:48:25.20
okay let's say you're going to say you're going to be financially secure and independent okay that

1006
01:48:25.20 --> 01:48:29.12
would be a much bigger boss right that's an awesome goal to have and of younger you make that

1007
01:48:29.12 --> 01:48:32.32
goal but better chance you have a achieving it yeah because now you're not wasting your money you're

1008
01:48:32.32 --> 01:48:35.12
actually saving for a house so you can get that house paid off so now you don't have a mortgage anyway

1009
01:48:35.12 --> 01:48:38.96
you know he's like yeah that's a bigger goal that's a broader goal just like when you when you

1010
01:48:38.96 --> 01:48:42.72
go to war you need to know what it is you're going to war for what are you going to do and when you

1011
01:48:42.72 --> 01:48:49.60
going to stop and what's your intended result yeah so you got it in a way you got to fill your life

1012
01:48:49.60 --> 01:48:56.32
with a bunch of goals so you don't get jam because like you have small goals that lead to the

1013
01:48:56.32 --> 01:49:02.24
big goal right so for instance you want to be financially secure and stable what are you going to do

1014
01:49:02.24 --> 01:49:05.92
you're going to save some of your money okay that's one thing you're going to buy a house that's

1015
01:49:05.92 --> 01:49:09.44
another thing you're going to pay off your car and you're not going to buy expensive dumb car

1016
01:49:09.44 --> 01:49:14.000
you're going to buy cheap cars until you have the money to buy them with cash you're going to

1017
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.88
make all these little things you're going to work extra you're going to you're going to do these

1018
01:49:16.88 --> 01:49:21.84
things so you're right you have you have your broad goal yes you have your long-term goal yes and

1019
01:49:21.84 --> 01:49:25.92
then you got your short-term goals that lead and are strategically aligned with that long-term goal

1020
01:49:25.92 --> 01:49:31.44
it's the same thing in war you have to have those both those things going on yeah yeah and then on top of

1021
01:49:31.44 --> 01:49:37.68
that you should have you want to have the last word did it don't you know no no no no I'm making this

1022
01:49:39.68 --> 01:49:45.04
every time I can slightly close out what you're trying to say you you add because it's not that I mean

1023
01:49:45.04 --> 01:49:49.92
it is that but then you're talking about life now and here you're just kind of the point where you

1024
01:49:49.92 --> 01:49:57.20
say okay you say one example is financial like you want to buy house you want to be financially

1025
01:49:57.20 --> 01:50:01.92
least secure that's one goal but in life there's more life than just financial so you want your

1026
01:50:01.92 --> 01:50:06.72
health you want your you know relationships you want your like there's all these things that

1027
01:50:06.72 --> 01:50:16.24
you you kind of hope or want to be solid yeah we'll say so but most people don't really put it in

1028
01:50:16.24 --> 01:50:20.88
perspective that clearly like okay I want you know I'm going to write this down one this so we're saying

1029
01:50:20.88 --> 01:50:27.76
those in the goals if you have goals yes if you have goals in those areas then you can you know you can

1030
01:50:27.76 --> 01:50:31.52
you can you can you can you can avoid a maneuver toward some exactly right avoid distractions all this

1031
01:50:31.52 --> 01:50:38.24
front and fight and fight towards those goals sounds obvious but that's what I'm saying it's like hard

1032
01:50:38.24 --> 01:50:45.52
to like designate each goal in life oh I didn't say this was going to be easy yeah that's

1033
01:50:45.52 --> 01:50:49.12
but it's not that hard if you sat down for 20 minutes I bet you could come up with some solid life

1034
01:50:49.12 --> 01:50:53.44
goal that's kind of the that's kind of the point I was making where it's too busy cruising

1035
01:50:53.44 --> 01:51:00.000
you know and being really it's about this this being distracted I think that's what it is

1036
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:05.52
you know and if the clear your goal the more I think control you can have over being distracted or

1037
01:51:05.52 --> 01:51:11.12
not because like if your goal isn't that clear it's almost like it's not going to be clear or it is you

1038
01:51:11.12 --> 01:51:17.20
won't really be clear when you're being distracted or not kind of thing people don't you know I'm

1039
01:51:17.20 --> 01:51:25.20
saying people I mean myself yeah we don't live our lives like just in constant pursuit of all our

1040
01:51:25.20 --> 01:51:34.56
specific goals we it's like a lot of life is minute to minute no no you can have some sections

1041
01:51:34.56 --> 01:51:38.24
that you can carve out so you can live like that but yeah that's not where you want to be how

1042
01:51:38.24 --> 01:51:42.48
you're rolling yeah no it's not how it should be so I'm saying so if you're and you'll notice

1043
01:51:42.48 --> 01:51:48.08
in life I think like any any solid goal that you've achieved you'll notice that that it took

1044
01:51:48.08 --> 01:51:52.40
that clear goal and you just didn't get distracted and you just want for it so it's like you've

1045
01:51:52.40 --> 01:51:56.88
done it for yourself and there's also just like being on the path yeah that's what I get about

1046
01:51:56.88 --> 01:52:03.68
Gjitsu right my goal in Gjitsu is never to get a black belt I never said like I want to be a

1047
01:52:03.68 --> 01:52:08.48
black belt just never I never even fought that yeah I just wanted to get better at this thing

1048
01:52:08.48 --> 01:52:13.52
right okay so you will not take it it was it was it was never you go was never my

1049
01:52:13.52 --> 01:52:20.88
goal was not to get a black belt my goal was to train Gjitsu and get better Gjitsu yeah in their four

1050
01:52:20.88 --> 01:52:29.36
comes my goal was like even finances I wasn't like hey I want to make X amount of money I was like

1051
01:52:29.36 --> 01:52:35.60
I want to be able to do whatever I want to do so let's move in that direction yeah that might not

1052
01:52:35.60 --> 01:52:38.80
even have a financial value like there's some people that do whatever they want to do but they

1053
01:52:38.80 --> 01:52:43.60
have a very low income but they set themselves up in such a way that they're allowed to do what they

1054
01:52:43.60 --> 01:52:51.28
pretty want to do check all right are you done last word not on any way oh yeah support right

1055
01:52:51.28 --> 01:52:56.64
that's what we were talking about all right yeah you can support it when you pursue goals

1056
01:52:57.76 --> 01:53:04.48
you may or may not need support I recommend support supporting yourself support of others from others

1057
01:53:04.48 --> 01:53:12.88
for others to a street kind anyway if one of your goals is to maintain physical shape and

1058
01:53:12.88 --> 01:53:21.92
capability it's important I work out right you work out proud yep all right yeah good so I work

1059
01:53:21.92 --> 01:53:29.36
out right and you know all so my wife will give me grief sometimes because I'll just like work out

1060
01:53:29.36 --> 01:53:33.28
at the wrong time you know because in my mind like working on it's important all right so I can

1061
01:53:33.28 --> 01:53:41.04
like love about you yes I can loosely justify oh yeah you know yeah it's dinner time but hey my health

1062
01:53:41.04 --> 01:53:47.28
right and sometimes it'll still frame it like oh yeah you choose to like work on your work on your

1063
01:53:47.28 --> 01:53:55.60
body or something like that and I say no it's health it's capability it's true but the point there is

1064
01:53:57.36 --> 01:54:02.96
it's important no matter how you frame it or your wife frames it it's important yeah you want to

1065
01:54:02.96 --> 01:54:12.32
do it strategic anyway while doing that you take real oil take stuff that helps maintain the structural

01:55:57.60 --> 01:56:02.40
doing did you say that origin stuff is made in here in America no big deal yeah do you it's no big deal

1083
01:56:02.40 --> 01:56:07.60
this made in America yeah i think it's a big deal but i don't like oh you're not gonna focus on

1084
01:56:11.60 --> 01:56:17.36
because you know the quality kind of leads with this one or they could go hand in hand

1085
01:56:17.36 --> 01:56:24.72
is it good quality because it's made in America or is it made in America because it's good quality

1086
01:56:25.84 --> 01:56:33.60
well both yeah it's good quality because it's made in America by qualified craftsmen yes i think

1087
01:56:33.60 --> 01:56:38.72
that's really the case yeah and some of it is no one of my buddies is he's he was on deployment

1124
01:59:58.80 --> 02:00:05.76
like my wife will we'll do something that there will be like young seals at yeah and my wife

1125
02:00:05.76 --> 02:00:10.72
so it's like oh thank god so young yeah they look so young you know that's the geoyce thing

1126
02:00:10.72 --> 02:00:16.24
yes i think that these kids are so young and then i i was one of those kids yeah and yeah they

1127
02:00:16.24 --> 02:00:23.04
are young you know that's two fights wars young kids well that's 18 19 20 22 years old 23 years old

1128
02:00:23.04 --> 02:00:29.84
that's who fights wars yeah and it's crazy and jpe kind of talks about this where your maturity kind

1129
02:00:29.84 --> 02:00:35.36
of gets on this like fast track when you jump to the military it doesn't it doesn't in some

1130
02:00:35.36 --> 02:00:40.96
way it doesn't it doesn't because you're also institutionalized oh yes so you don't like when

1131
02:00:40.96 --> 02:00:43.60
you're in the middle that's what hurts some guys when they get out of the military they're like

1132
02:00:43.60 --> 02:00:46.72
wait a second i don't wait what is my paycheck it's well it's come every two weeks now it's not

1133
02:00:46.72 --> 02:00:51.36
there and it's used to it yeah oh you have a mission here's what you're gonna do and that

1134
02:00:51.36 --> 02:00:55.68
when you're in the military you just here's your clothes that you're gonna wear yeah you don't

1135
02:00:55.68 --> 02:00:59.60
mean here's the haircut that you're gonna have you get all the military also and you're like

1136
02:00:59.60 --> 02:01:05.04
you don't have this direction anymore so you do get it matures you in some ways and otherwise

1137
02:01:05.04 --> 02:01:09.84
you get stunted growth that's why you get some guys doing dumb shit we're 30 years old 38 years

1138
02:01:09.84 --> 02:01:16.72
old 42 years old yeah they're doing the midlife crisis thing but when you think when you don't

1139
02:01:16.72 --> 02:01:20.16
maybe it's not even a midlife they're just trying to figure it out because you haven't had right they

1140
02:01:20.16 --> 02:01:24.40
didn't do that like at the time is everyone else but you know how you talk about your wife looks

1141
02:01:25.60 --> 02:01:32.24
at the younger guys or the seals and say well they look so young that's I think that's like

1142
02:01:32.24 --> 02:01:37.60
an indicator that she doesn't feel old you know because you know how like when you're when you

1143
02:01:37.60 --> 02:01:41.36
kind of like I do the same thing when I look at college football when I watch college football because

1144
02:01:41.36 --> 02:01:46.48
I remember when I was playing football it's oh yeah there was like I 26 years old on my team

1145
02:01:46.48 --> 02:01:52.96
26 we're in the same age as old school yeah it didn't help you kind of going bald and stuff like that

1146
02:01:52.96 --> 02:02:00.80
but nonetheless he's 26 26 is young by the way and depending on how old you are because when you're 16

1147
02:02:00.80 --> 02:02:09.04
you don't think you if I tried to ask my son who's 15 like what what how far away 25 years

1148
02:02:09.04 --> 02:02:14.24
or how long was it until he was 25 like he would understand 10 years he has no

1149
02:02:14.24 --> 02:02:23.44
he would not be able to like cognitively assess what a 25 year old human being is thinking about

1150
02:02:23.44 --> 02:02:29.20
he's 50 no access he's not got it going on yeah but I feel like he would still be able to figure

1151
02:02:29.20 --> 02:02:35.20
out okay 25 you know people when do people die of old age quote unquote would be what 80s

1152
02:02:35.92 --> 02:02:40.96
right typically just you don't win ever so you figure 25

1153
02:02:40.96 --> 02:02:48.24
so what less than a 30 year life 26 less than a third that would be considered old technically

1154
02:02:48.24 --> 02:02:53.44
if if they were to think about I think a 15 year old would grasp that even though 26 year old was old

1155
02:02:53.44 --> 02:02:58.80
he was old yeah I thought so so when I look back and then I don't feel old as old as I am

1156
02:02:58.80 --> 02:03:03.84
I don't feel like old I think back when I was in like college or whatever and I think about

1157
02:03:03.84 --> 02:03:08.08
the number of my current age and I think dang that's that's old that's old or person

1158
02:03:08.08 --> 02:03:15.92
being that older person now I don't feel like how I thought that older person to film right

1159
02:03:15.92 --> 02:03:20.48
and I really think that now it really comes and gets put into perspective when I watch college

1160
02:03:20.48 --> 02:03:24.64
football and I seem to take off their helmet I'm like dang that is a child right there playing

1161
02:03:24.64 --> 02:03:29.84
college football performing out performing like super good but they just look so young I'm just like

1162
02:03:29.84 --> 02:03:36.08
your wife they look so young but it's because I don't feel like an old person that's so that's good

1163
02:03:36.08 --> 02:03:40.08
yeah I guess so because you know if you feel like old person you're like yeah they look

1164
02:03:40.08 --> 02:03:44.08
young because they're young there are young I mean old person there you feel like you should

1165
02:03:44.08 --> 02:03:47.92
be in there too and they're like oh yeah and then you say oh okay he's easy on going to

I wouldn't be pushing stuff that anything goes cool and it's joc will prove kind of the pink

1183
02:05:47.92 --> 02:05:52.96
shirt's aren't joc or no but nonetheless if you want to get shirts and stuff that's where it is joc was

1184
02:05:52.96 --> 02:06:01.04
store calm they are good stuff they are good they're not like the cheap ones this is what I'm saying

1185
02:06:01.04 --> 02:06:06.40
so boom you can rest assured but yeah tell much you think if you have one hey people take pictures

1186
02:06:06.40 --> 02:06:12.16
of themselves with the shirt on and they say this is a good shirt and that's good I encourage that

1187
02:06:12.16 --> 02:06:21.84
and if you don't like this shirt let me know too there it is also good way to support yourself

1188
02:06:22.56 --> 02:06:27.84
one of the better ways in my opinion depends on what kind of person you are is psychological warfare

1189
02:06:27.84 --> 02:06:34.16
if you don't know what that is it's an album with tracks with joc on each track telling you

1190
02:06:34.16 --> 02:06:41.44
that in your on your campaign against weakness when you hit those roadblocks that's what it is

1191
02:06:41.44 --> 02:06:48.72
rope that's what they are roadblocks mental fatigue distractions all this stuff these tracks will

1192
02:06:48.72 --> 02:06:55.68
help you through it it's joc of telling you pragmatically given you practical information in advice

1193
02:06:55.68 --> 02:07:01.36
how to get over those roadblocks around those roadblocks or through those roadblocks

1194
02:07:01.36 --> 02:07:08.24
I'll make a psychological warfare track then it's gonna be directed towards you to make you talk

1195
02:07:08.24 --> 02:07:14.16
about this stuff faster okay well here's the thing when I you know I come across this

1196
02:07:15.20 --> 02:07:23.60
smart right yeah see and I'm I feel compelled to share the valuable points that I think

1197
02:07:23.60 --> 02:07:30.08
are valuable that I've used or that I felt with each thing but then I'm like oh wait that'll take

1198
02:07:30.08 --> 02:07:36.32
a long time to explain so sometimes I go with it you don't seem to care sometimes I don't

1199
02:07:36.32 --> 02:07:45.12
but today I'm giving you a downjack no I think it's valuable okay we'll go with that

1200
02:07:45.84 --> 02:07:49.68
now watch how fast I do this yeah but you're not gonna give them the whole thing you know

1201
02:07:49.68 --> 02:07:55.28
like the jockel way to you know you didn't demonstrate not demonstrate explain

1202
02:07:56.08 --> 02:08:01.28
yeah the jockel way to guaranteed to get your deadlift 8000 pounds boom that's it done next

1203
02:08:01.28 --> 02:08:07.36
but there's three books you can get way the warrior kid gets kids on the path boom done

1204
02:08:07.36 --> 02:08:13.04
I should have dropped more about bigger kid that's cool no need I don't know man but I think

1205
02:08:14.32 --> 02:08:20.16
like I read way the warrior kid to my daughter every single night it's one or two chapters not too

1206
02:08:20.16 --> 02:08:25.12
long just one or two chapters so she wants to read the next chapter she wanted she wants me to

1207
02:08:25.12 --> 02:08:28.96
read the next chapter that night I say no tomorrow she's looking forward to it every single night

1208
02:08:28.96 --> 02:08:35.44
it's just the mantra the whole way the warrior kid is just a background to you for life yes

1209
02:08:35.44 --> 02:08:40.56
good thing to know don't be weak like work hard all this stuff it would explain that whole thing

1210
02:08:42.32 --> 02:08:45.12
to me I just say because that's the value that I got

1211
02:08:45.60 --> 02:08:49.68
way the warrior kid if you want a longer explanation you can email echo he'll give it to you

1212
02:08:49.68 --> 02:08:52.32
