00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.12
This is Jocko podcast number 353 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:04.12 --> 00:00:05.12
Jocko willing.

3
00:00:05.12 --> 00:00:05.96
Good evening Echo.

4
00:00:05.96 --> 00:00:06.96
Good evening.

5
00:00:07.46 --> 00:00:09.52
My brave fellows,

6
00:00:11.20 --> 00:00:13.32
you have done all I asked you to do

7
00:00:13.32 --> 00:00:15.80
and more than can be reasonably expected,

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.52
but your country is at stake.

9
00:00:19.52 --> 00:00:23.64
Your wives, your houses, and all that you hold dear.

10
00:00:24.96 --> 00:00:28.48
You have worn, worn yourselves out with fatigues

11
00:00:28.48 --> 00:00:30.12
and hardships,

12
00:00:31.68 --> 00:00:33.36
but we know not how to spare you.

13
00:00:35.16 --> 00:00:38.20
If you will consent to stay one month longer,

14
00:00:38.20 --> 00:00:40.96
you will render that service to the cause of liberty

15
00:00:40.96 --> 00:00:42.52
and to your country,

16
00:00:42.52 --> 00:00:44.88
which you probably can never do

17
00:00:44.88 --> 00:00:47.48
under any other circumstances.

18
00:00:50.64 --> 00:00:55.44
And that right there was a quote from George Washington,

19
00:00:55.44 --> 00:01:00.24
encouraging his men to re-enlist in the army.

20
00:01:00.24 --> 00:01:05.16
And he made that speech on Tuesday, December 31st, 1776.

21
00:01:05.16 --> 00:01:10.16
This was less than a week after the successful attack

22
00:01:10.40 --> 00:01:14.24
at Trenton and great victory for Washington's army,

23
00:01:14.24 --> 00:01:15.44
the one that everybody knows about,

24
00:01:15.44 --> 00:01:17.52
crossing the Delaware River

25
00:01:18.48 --> 00:01:21.60
and able to achieve this victory.

26
00:01:21.60 --> 00:01:24.96
But the men had suffered greatly.

27
00:01:24.96 --> 00:01:26.36
Prior to that, they had lost the battle

28
00:01:26.36 --> 00:01:28.80
of White Plains in October,

29
00:01:28.80 --> 00:01:31.28
the battle at Fort Washington in November,

30
00:01:31.28 --> 00:01:33.88
their uniforms, when you read about

31
00:01:33.88 --> 00:01:35.16
what condition they were in,

32
00:01:35.16 --> 00:01:37.56
they were just in tatters and rags at this point.

33
00:01:37.56 --> 00:01:39.20
Some of them didn't have shoes,

34
00:01:40.28 --> 00:01:42.64
by the way, December in the Northeast.

35
00:01:44.44 --> 00:01:48.64
So this was the last day of the year, December 31st.

36
00:01:48.64 --> 00:01:53.000
And interestingly, most of the soldiers enlistments,

37
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.88
they'd enlisted for a year or two years.

38
00:01:54.88 --> 00:01:57.32
And so a lot of the soldiers, their enlistments were up

39
00:01:58.24 --> 00:01:59.24
at the end of the year.

40
00:02:00.28 --> 00:02:03.68
And this was a potential disaster for the army.

41
00:02:05.64 --> 00:02:07.44
But through this personal appeal,

42
00:02:07.44 --> 00:02:12.28
Washington convinced about half the men to stay and carry on.

43
00:02:12.28 --> 00:02:17.12
And they were able to defeat the British at Princeton

44
00:02:17.12 --> 00:02:23.28
and kind of revived the morale of the Continental Army.

45
00:02:23.28 --> 00:02:27.40
But that just put that question into my mind

46
00:02:27.40 --> 00:02:29.04
is when is enough enough?

47
00:02:29.04 --> 00:02:33.08
And we call on our servicemen and women to do so much.

48
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And it's amazing when they decide to continue to serve.

49
00:02:40.76 --> 00:02:43.92
And it's an honor here to have one of those men

50
00:02:43.92 --> 00:02:46.08
with us tonight, retired seal,

51
00:02:46.08 --> 00:02:49.52
26 years of service, husband, father, teammate,

52
00:02:49.52 --> 00:02:52.52
friend of mine who deployed to Iraq,

53
00:02:52.52 --> 00:02:57.20
deployed to Afghanistan, Africa, Asia, Europe,

54
00:02:57.20 --> 00:02:59.48
South America, Central America.

55
00:02:59.48 --> 00:03:03.72
And he's looking to continue his service now.

56
00:03:03.72 --> 00:03:05.68
His name is Derek Van Orden.

57
00:03:05.68 --> 00:03:06.96
We used to call him Van Oh.

58
00:03:06.96 --> 00:03:08.48
That's right.

59
00:03:08.48 --> 00:03:09.32
Van Oh?

60
00:03:09.32 --> 00:03:10.16
Van Oh.

61
00:03:10.16 --> 00:03:11.000
Derek?

62
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.84
Yeah.

63
00:03:11.84 --> 00:03:12.68
Thanks for coming down, man.

64
00:03:12.68 --> 00:03:13.52
Thank you for having me.

65
00:03:13.52 --> 00:03:14.36
Good to see you.

66
00:03:14.36 --> 00:03:15.20
It's good to see you too.

67
00:03:15.20 --> 00:03:16.72
DVO.

68
00:03:16.72 --> 00:03:17.56
I don't know why.

69
00:03:17.56 --> 00:03:18.40
I mean, I do.

70
00:03:18.40 --> 00:03:21.76
Oh, because you gotta have the three letters.

71
00:03:21.76 --> 00:03:22.60
You know what?

72
00:03:22.60 --> 00:03:24.92
That's a little too close to deviant.

73
00:03:24.92 --> 00:03:26.12
I don't know if I like that.

74
00:03:26.12 --> 00:03:27.64
Well, yeah.

75
00:03:27.64 --> 00:03:29.08
Speaking of that, man.

76
00:03:29.08 --> 00:03:30.96
So I've never been to your place here.

77
00:03:30.96 --> 00:03:32.96
It's marvelous.

78
00:03:32.96 --> 00:03:34.72
And went to the head.

79
00:03:34.72 --> 00:03:37.52
That's the bathroom for folks who aren't in the Navy.

80
00:03:37.52 --> 00:03:41.24
And like 30 guys, I was talking to Echo about this.

81
00:03:41.24 --> 00:03:43.44
They're all looking at me like, what are you doing?

82
00:03:43.44 --> 00:03:47.44
I look like, you know, the hillbilly came rolling in.

83
00:03:47.44 --> 00:03:49.60
But it's a wonderful facility here, man.

84
00:03:49.60 --> 00:03:50.64
Yeah.

85
00:03:50.64 --> 00:03:51.60
Well, it's a mixed martial arts.

86
00:03:51.60 --> 00:03:53.64
So I guess your point is a mixed martial arts gym.

87
00:03:53.64 --> 00:03:58.48
It's literally the middle of our professional pro MMA

88
00:03:58.48 --> 00:04:00.64
practice is going on out in the gym.

89
00:04:00.64 --> 00:04:05.76
So it's the Alliance team, which trains here out of victory.

90
00:04:05.76 --> 00:04:08.12
With some incredible fighters, some champs in there.

91
00:04:08.12 --> 00:04:09.84
Dominic Cruz just saw Dom.

92
00:04:09.84 --> 00:04:14.52
And so, yes, they're athletes in peak physique in the prime

93
00:04:14.52 --> 00:04:16.000
of their athletic careers.

94
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.60
Well, I'm certainly in my prime.

95
00:04:17.60 --> 00:04:20.12
You are like Doc Holiday.

96
00:04:20.12 --> 00:04:22.40
You are in your prime just like Doc Holiday,

97
00:04:22.40 --> 00:04:24.76
apparently at this point.

98
00:04:24.76 --> 00:04:25.72
No, awesome to see you, man.

99
00:04:25.72 --> 00:04:27.80
So let's start at the beginning.

100
00:04:27.80 --> 00:04:29.12
Let's start where you came from.

101
00:04:29.12 --> 00:04:31.56
Let's figure out how you got here today.

102
00:04:31.56 --> 00:04:33.76
And let's talk about that story.

103
00:04:33.76 --> 00:04:35.48
So when and where were you born?

104
00:04:35.48 --> 00:04:38.76
Well, to begin in the beginning, as they say,

105
00:04:38.76 --> 00:04:43.04
I was raised in abject rural poverty by a single mom.

106
00:04:43.04 --> 00:04:44.32
My dad was not honorable.

107
00:04:44.32 --> 00:04:45.64
No other way to describe that.

108
00:04:45.64 --> 00:04:47.80
He abandoned us when I was an infant.

109
00:04:47.80 --> 00:04:50.24
And I dropped out of high school when I was 16 years old.

110
00:04:50.24 --> 00:04:51.12
Hold on a second.

111
00:04:51.12 --> 00:04:52.84
You got really quick through a lot of years.

112
00:04:52.84 --> 00:04:53.64
Oh.

113
00:04:53.64 --> 00:04:54.28
So I was.

114
00:04:54.28 --> 00:04:55.32
So you were born.

115
00:04:55.32 --> 00:04:56.40
So where is this?

116
00:04:56.40 --> 00:04:58.000
I was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

117
00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.48
My father abandoned us.

118
00:04:59.48 --> 00:05:02.76
We had to move in with my grandmother in Laverne, Minnesota.

119
00:05:02.76 --> 00:05:04.80
What's Laverne, Minnesota?

120
00:05:04.80 --> 00:05:06.56
For some reason, I haven't heard of this metropolitan city.

121
00:05:06.56 --> 00:05:10.40
Well, you should have because Ken Burns did one of his

122
00:05:10.40 --> 00:05:11.84
documentaries called The War.

123
00:05:11.84 --> 00:05:12.34
OK.

124
00:05:12.34 --> 00:05:14.04
It featured the Palace Theater, which

125
00:05:14.04 --> 00:05:15.28
is on Main Street in Laverne.

126
00:05:15.28 --> 00:05:18.24
And we lived in the apartment above the Palace Theater

127
00:05:18.24 --> 00:05:19.76
once we got enough together because we

128
00:05:19.76 --> 00:05:21.88
had to live with my grandmother when we were that poor.

129
00:05:21.88 --> 00:05:24.12
So what's the population of Laverne?

130
00:05:24.12 --> 00:05:25.68
Gosh, I don't know now.

131
00:05:25.68 --> 00:05:26.56
But it's a small town.

132
00:05:26.56 --> 00:05:27.64
It's a small town.

133
00:05:27.64 --> 00:05:30.80
What was your mom doing to make ends meet?

134
00:05:30.80 --> 00:05:34.12
She was one of the first female sports

135
00:05:34.12 --> 00:05:36.28
reporters in the country.

136
00:05:36.28 --> 00:05:38.16
And she's always been a stats head.

137
00:05:38.16 --> 00:05:40.84
And she died nine years ago, eight years ago now.

138
00:05:40.84 --> 00:05:41.88
My mom, she's wonderful.

139
00:05:41.88 --> 00:05:42.80
Carol Ann Mulligan.

140
00:05:42.80 --> 00:05:46.000
She's like this tall, five foot nothing,

141
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.12
and hard as woodpecker lips.

142
00:05:48.12 --> 00:05:49.84
She's a tough man.

143
00:05:49.84 --> 00:05:55.36
And then she got a job with a company called INA, which became

144
00:05:55.36 --> 00:05:56.68
Cigna Insurance.

145
00:05:56.68 --> 00:05:58.24
And that's how we wound up in Wisconsin.

146
00:05:58.24 --> 00:06:01.32
So I grew up in Wisconsin, southeastern Wisconsin,

147
00:06:01.32 --> 00:06:03.16
because my mother got promoted.

148
00:06:03.16 --> 00:06:05.80
Wait, so when did she leave sports reported?

149
00:06:05.80 --> 00:06:07.20
Oh my gosh, that would have been.

150
00:06:07.20 --> 00:06:08.68
That was prior to the insurance thing?

151
00:06:08.68 --> 00:06:09.52
I don't need the years.

152
00:06:09.52 --> 00:06:11.40
But so she was doing that sort of thing.

153
00:06:11.40 --> 00:06:13.36
Right, it was kind of on and off that sort of stuff.

154
00:06:13.36 --> 00:06:15.64
Right, because it was just weird to have a woman reporting

155
00:06:15.64 --> 00:06:16.72
sports.

156
00:06:16.72 --> 00:06:17.88
Now it's common.

157
00:06:17.88 --> 00:06:19.08
Yeah, it's normative.

158
00:06:19.08 --> 00:06:23.60
So she couldn't quite pull off a career in sports reporting?

159
00:06:23.60 --> 00:06:24.52
No, that wouldn't happen.

160
00:06:24.52 --> 00:06:26.40
But then she went to the insurance business?

161
00:06:26.40 --> 00:06:28.64
Right, she started as a secretary.

162
00:06:28.64 --> 00:06:30.44
And then she got promoted.

163
00:06:30.44 --> 00:06:32.60
She was very bright.

164
00:06:32.60 --> 00:06:38.40
And she wound up retiring, running the West Coast for Cigna.

165
00:06:38.40 --> 00:06:39.56
She ran this whole office.

166
00:06:39.56 --> 00:06:40.36
And it was interesting.

167
00:06:40.36 --> 00:06:43.80
She's sitting around hearing the story.

168
00:06:43.80 --> 00:06:46.96
It's fascinating, because it helped me later on in my career

169
00:06:46.96 --> 00:06:49.000
as a seal, that she was like, wait a minute.

170
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.76
If we have this phone, and anyone has a phone,

171
00:06:51.76 --> 00:06:53.60
they can call this number.

172
00:06:53.60 --> 00:06:55.60
And if they have the ability to understand

173
00:06:55.60 --> 00:06:57.44
what's going on with this phone, they

174
00:06:57.44 --> 00:06:59.72
can get everybody's insurance information.

175
00:06:59.72 --> 00:07:04.04
So she was one of the first people to get into cybersecurity,

176
00:07:04.04 --> 00:07:05.20
because you had the modem.

177
00:07:05.20 --> 00:07:05.80
You know what I mean?

178
00:07:05.80 --> 00:07:06.40
It didn't matter.

179
00:07:06.40 --> 00:07:07.52
There was no encryption there.

180
00:07:07.52 --> 00:07:11.96
It was if you could have a modem, you know, that sort of stuff.

181
00:07:11.96 --> 00:07:13.84
So she started doing that.

182
00:07:13.84 --> 00:07:14.64
You guys are that.

183
00:07:14.64 --> 00:07:15.92
You don't know how old are you?

184
00:07:15.92 --> 00:07:16.84
44.

185
00:07:16.84 --> 00:07:17.52
All right, you remember.

186
00:07:17.52 --> 00:07:18.84
You're old.

187
00:07:18.84 --> 00:07:19.84
You remember dial-up?

188
00:07:19.84 --> 00:07:20.84
Yeah.

189
00:07:20.84 --> 00:07:21.84
Look at that.

190
00:07:21.84 --> 00:07:22.84
Down for the dial-up.

191
00:07:22.84 --> 00:07:23.84
100% AOL.

192
00:07:23.84 --> 00:07:24.88
You got mail, son.

193
00:07:24.88 --> 00:07:25.76
Yeah, you do.

194
00:07:25.76 --> 00:07:27.88
So she did that.

195
00:07:27.88 --> 00:07:34.32
And not having a father figure as a dad, my uncle Bob,

196
00:07:34.32 --> 00:07:37.80
which is her oldest brother, she's one of 10 Irish Catholics.

197
00:07:37.80 --> 00:07:43.28
And Bob left Worthington, which is outside of Laverne,

198
00:07:43.28 --> 00:07:46.52
when he was 16 years old, and joined the Navy in World War II.

199
00:07:46.52 --> 00:07:47.88
There's this great picture of him.

200
00:07:47.88 --> 00:07:50.12
He's sitting like this with his hands over the rail

201
00:07:50.12 --> 00:07:53.04
of an ammunition oiler right off at Iwo Jima.

202
00:07:53.04 --> 00:07:54.32
No shirt on.

203
00:07:54.32 --> 00:07:56.24
You know, just hanging, being a sailor.

204
00:07:56.24 --> 00:07:58.48
And it's just so fun, you know.

205
00:07:58.48 --> 00:08:02.96
But yeah, so Gunny went to, he's in the Navy,

206
00:08:02.96 --> 00:08:06.68
and then they demobilized everybody after World War II.

207
00:08:06.68 --> 00:08:10.28
So he goes back to Minnesota, can't find a job.

208
00:08:10.28 --> 00:08:11.84
And he's like, man, I need a job.

209
00:08:11.84 --> 00:08:13.32
This is Uncle Bob we're talking about.

210
00:08:13.32 --> 00:08:14.88
This is Robert Francis Mulligan.

211
00:08:14.88 --> 00:08:19.08
The oldest brother of your mom.

212
00:08:19.08 --> 00:08:19.68
Of my mom.

213
00:08:19.68 --> 00:08:20.24
Got it.

214
00:08:20.24 --> 00:08:22.36
So he was one of 10.

215
00:08:22.36 --> 00:08:24.56
And so he wants to go back to Minnesota.

216
00:08:24.56 --> 00:08:26.84
This is so fun, because we're in San Diego.

217
00:08:26.84 --> 00:08:29.12
And he goes to the Marine Corps.

218
00:08:29.12 --> 00:08:31.08
And he's like, can I join the Marines?

219
00:08:31.08 --> 00:08:33.04
He goes, yeah, there's some staff sergeant there.

220
00:08:33.04 --> 00:08:36.64
He goes, OK, here's your bus ticket to San Diego.

221
00:08:36.64 --> 00:08:39.64
And you'll go to the bus station, take your cab to MCRD,

222
00:08:39.64 --> 00:08:41.48
which is right down the road from here.

223
00:08:41.48 --> 00:08:43.12
And then you're there.

224
00:08:43.12 --> 00:08:45.16
And Bob's looking at his feet.

225
00:08:45.16 --> 00:08:46.12
It's museum feet.

226
00:08:46.12 --> 00:08:47.52
You don't want to be in a museum anymore.

227
00:08:47.52 --> 00:08:48.96
You can't shelf for your feet.

228
00:08:48.96 --> 00:08:51.000
And the staff sergeant looks at him.

229
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
He goes, you don't have enough money for a cab, do you?

230
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.96
And he's like, nope.

231
00:08:53.96 --> 00:08:56.16
So he gives him money for a cab.

232
00:08:56.16 --> 00:09:01.72
So Bob takes the bus, cab, MCRD, Marine Corps, fast forward,

233
00:09:01.72 --> 00:09:03.24
20 years or whatever it is.

234
00:09:03.24 --> 00:09:04.88
He sees this warren officer.

235
00:09:04.88 --> 00:09:06.56
And in that Marine Corps, they're called gunners.

236
00:09:06.56 --> 00:09:09.36
And he's like, hey, man, I think I know you.

237
00:09:09.36 --> 00:09:11.84
And he goes, were you a recruiter in Minnesota?

238
00:09:11.84 --> 00:09:16.24
He goes, I'm the guy that you gave the money for the cab.

239
00:09:16.24 --> 00:09:17.84
And the gunner looks at him and goes,

240
00:09:17.84 --> 00:09:21.80
do you know how many people have to give money for a cab?

241
00:09:21.80 --> 00:09:23.84
So we think that things are difficult now.

242
00:09:23.84 --> 00:09:26.04
And we're getting, trust me, man, the economy's going

243
00:09:26.04 --> 00:09:26.68
right in the tank.

244
00:09:26.68 --> 00:09:27.64
It's bad.

245
00:09:27.64 --> 00:09:31.96
But the level of affluence that we have in the United States

246
00:09:31.96 --> 00:09:34.32
of America now is unprecedented in the history of the world.

247
00:09:34.32 --> 00:09:37.32
And that goes across all spectrums.

248
00:09:37.32 --> 00:09:39.72
I mean, that was like, you didn't have anything.

249
00:09:39.72 --> 00:09:42.52
So Bob does 20 years.

250
00:09:42.52 --> 00:09:46.72
He goes to Korea, grievously injured

251
00:09:46.72 --> 00:09:48.98
by Chinese communist soldiers throwing a China

252
00:09:48.98 --> 00:09:55.60
com grenade into his Foxhole, and then he winds up going to Laos

253
00:09:55.60 --> 00:09:57.60
in 1962.

254
00:09:57.60 --> 00:09:59.64
Retired becomes a police officer in a small village

255
00:09:59.64 --> 00:10:02.56
in Wisconsin called Shinigwa and retired as the chief police,

256
00:10:02.56 --> 00:10:05.32
the fire chief, and the village administrator.

257
00:10:05.32 --> 00:10:08.68
And he ends up being, you say, your father figure.

258
00:10:08.68 --> 00:10:09.72
Correct.

259
00:10:09.72 --> 00:10:11.68
What do you have for brothers and sisters?

260
00:10:11.68 --> 00:10:13.08
I have one brother.

261
00:10:13.08 --> 00:10:14.24
Older, younger?

262
00:10:14.24 --> 00:10:14.96
Older.

263
00:10:14.96 --> 00:10:16.000
OK.

264
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.16
Now, what?

265
00:10:17.16 --> 00:10:18.40
You're now going to school.

266
00:10:18.40 --> 00:10:21.28
You used to live in above this theater in Laverne?

267
00:10:21.28 --> 00:10:23.68
Right, till I was in second grade.

268
00:10:23.68 --> 00:10:24.18
OK.

269
00:10:24.18 --> 00:10:24.56
And then we moved.

270
00:10:24.56 --> 00:10:25.84
Mom got promoted.

271
00:10:25.84 --> 00:10:28.56
Then we moved to Heartland, Wisconsin.

272
00:10:28.56 --> 00:10:29.36
Heartland?

273
00:10:29.36 --> 00:10:30.40
Heartland.

274
00:10:30.40 --> 00:10:31.36
Just straight up.

275
00:10:31.36 --> 00:10:32.80
Heartland, Wisconsin.

276
00:10:32.80 --> 00:10:34.92
Yeah, man.

277
00:10:34.92 --> 00:10:35.56
So we grew up there.

278
00:10:35.56 --> 00:10:36.56
We were still very poor.

279
00:10:36.56 --> 00:10:41.44
The apartments we live in now, I think, are Section 8 housing.

280
00:10:41.44 --> 00:10:45.000
That we lived in then are now, I believe, Section 8 housing.

281
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.24
And now this is where you go to middle school.

282
00:10:48.24 --> 00:10:50.88
Is this where you go to high school and stuff?

283
00:10:50.88 --> 00:10:51.88
No.

284
00:10:51.88 --> 00:10:54.16
So mom got promoted again.

285
00:10:54.16 --> 00:10:56.36
And then we moved to Oregon.

286
00:10:56.36 --> 00:10:57.12
Oh, OK.

287
00:10:57.12 --> 00:11:00.72
And that's where I was in high school for a year and two weeks

288
00:11:00.72 --> 00:11:02.20
of my sophomore year.

289
00:11:02.20 --> 00:11:04.16
Were you playing sports growing up?

290
00:11:04.16 --> 00:11:07.24
I wrestled for my freshman year.

291
00:11:07.24 --> 00:11:10.88
But I never was into those types of things.

292
00:11:10.88 --> 00:11:13.20
I just I never was.

293
00:11:13.20 --> 00:11:15.04
My brother's super big in professional sports.

294
00:11:15.04 --> 00:11:18.24
Clearly, my mother was because she was a sports reporter.

295
00:11:18.24 --> 00:11:21.28
But just never did much for me.

296
00:11:21.28 --> 00:11:22.48
I don't want to.

297
00:11:22.48 --> 00:11:23.28
What were you focused on?

298
00:11:23.28 --> 00:11:25.76
Were you focused on academics?

299
00:11:25.76 --> 00:11:27.28
No, you know what?

300
00:11:27.28 --> 00:11:28.40
I wasn't.

301
00:11:28.40 --> 00:11:29.60
I mean, I read.

302
00:11:29.60 --> 00:11:31.84
I've always been a huge reader.

303
00:11:31.84 --> 00:11:34.52
From when I was a little kid, I was always reading.

304
00:11:34.52 --> 00:11:38.68
And I was kind of more, I don't know how to put that.

305
00:11:38.68 --> 00:11:43.12
I just I was into exploring the world from a different

306
00:11:43.12 --> 00:11:46.44
perspective because so we were so poor.

307
00:11:46.44 --> 00:11:48.52
I mean, like dirt poor.

308
00:11:48.52 --> 00:11:52.28
And I knew I could never collect material objects

309
00:11:52.28 --> 00:11:53.36
because of that.

310
00:11:53.36 --> 00:11:56.000
And so from when I was just a little kid,

311
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.76
I started collecting relationships with people.

312
00:11:58.76 --> 00:12:01.80
And I had the same friends that I've had since I was 14

313
00:12:01.80 --> 00:12:04.20
because I understand the value of human beings.

314
00:12:04.20 --> 00:12:06.60
And I understand the value of the intrinsic nature

315
00:12:06.60 --> 00:12:10.72
if somebody's intellect vise their physical being.

316
00:12:10.72 --> 00:12:13.24
And they're clearly intertwined.

317
00:12:13.24 --> 00:12:15.000
One is part of another.

318
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.92
But so for me, that's always been my thing.

319
00:12:17.92 --> 00:12:22.72
So I've always really focused on humans.

320
00:12:22.72 --> 00:12:28.32
And the additive value of people, the synergistic effect

321
00:12:28.32 --> 00:12:31.96
of getting together, that's how you create.

322
00:12:31.96 --> 00:12:33.64
And so I've always done that.

323
00:12:33.64 --> 00:12:36.68
I've done some art stuff and whatever.

324
00:12:36.68 --> 00:12:38.000
What's art stuff or whatever?

325
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.72
Well, sketch, I write poetry and believe it or not.

326
00:12:42.72 --> 00:12:46.28
So when you're in school, are you like hanging out

327
00:12:46.28 --> 00:12:50.12
with the freaking poetry club?

328
00:12:50.12 --> 00:12:51.12
Is that what we got going on?

329
00:12:51.12 --> 00:12:52.04
No, I was.

330
00:12:52.04 --> 00:12:53.32
Wait, were you wearing all black?

331
00:12:53.32 --> 00:12:55.40
And like, oh my gosh.

332
00:12:55.40 --> 00:12:56.96
Dying in your black?

333
00:12:56.96 --> 00:12:59.52
Who's wearing all black here?

334
00:12:59.52 --> 00:13:01.44
You guys, is this camera working?

335
00:13:01.44 --> 00:13:03.12
So no, man.

336
00:13:03.12 --> 00:13:07.20
I was kind of an outsider because, again, children

337
00:13:07.20 --> 00:13:09.08
can be very cruel.

338
00:13:09.08 --> 00:13:11.92
And when I say we're poor, I mean, we were poor.

339
00:13:11.92 --> 00:13:16.16
So I was ostracized because of my poverty.

340
00:13:16.16 --> 00:13:17.24
And then when we moved to Oregon,

341
00:13:17.24 --> 00:13:18.80
it was a very affluent community.

342
00:13:18.80 --> 00:13:21.64
And I wasn't just on the other side of the tracks,

343
00:13:21.64 --> 00:13:24.12
I was on the other side of it.

344
00:13:24.12 --> 00:13:29.64
So that can be very, you can take that one or two directions.

345
00:13:29.64 --> 00:13:32.20
You can consciously choose your path.

346
00:13:32.20 --> 00:13:35.72
And you can choose to ride that into the dirt

347
00:13:35.72 --> 00:13:40.12
and get into this destructive cycle.

348
00:13:40.12 --> 00:13:42.04
And we've seen this happen over and over again,

349
00:13:42.04 --> 00:13:43.80
intergenerational poverty and all these things.

350
00:13:43.80 --> 00:13:46.64
And people feel like they have no way out.

351
00:13:46.64 --> 00:13:49.48
I mean, I was the, did you ever see someone walk around

352
00:13:49.48 --> 00:13:50.80
with their head down?

353
00:13:50.80 --> 00:13:51.12
Yeah.

354
00:13:51.12 --> 00:13:52.76
And they walk like that all the time.

355
00:13:52.76 --> 00:13:54.96
Somebody, I ran into them.

356
00:13:54.96 --> 00:13:56.16
Where did I see them?

357
00:13:56.16 --> 00:13:59.32
They're like, oh, so I had dropped out of high school.

358
00:13:59.32 --> 00:14:01.04
I was working.

359
00:14:01.04 --> 00:14:02.76
I've been supporting myself since I was 16.

360
00:14:02.76 --> 00:14:05.76
And someone's like, oh, I remember you from high school.

361
00:14:05.76 --> 00:14:08.16
You're the guy that always walked with your head down.

362
00:14:08.16 --> 00:14:10.72
And I was like, wait a minute, you're right.

363
00:14:10.72 --> 00:14:12.92
So I started walking with my head up.

364
00:14:12.92 --> 00:14:14.08
And just that simple.

365
00:14:14.08 --> 00:14:15.76
Wait, when was that?

366
00:14:15.76 --> 00:14:17.84
I would have been 17 or 18.

367
00:14:17.84 --> 00:14:20.44
So when you're 17 or 18, someone said, oh, you used to walk

368
00:14:20.44 --> 00:14:21.24
around with your head down.

369
00:14:21.24 --> 00:14:22.36
You're the guy.

370
00:14:22.36 --> 00:14:23.16
They recognized me.

371
00:14:23.16 --> 00:14:25.60
You're the guy that would walk around with your head down.

372
00:14:25.60 --> 00:14:28.88
I wasn't self-absorbed, but it was like I felt like,

373
00:14:28.88 --> 00:14:32.64
because we were so pouring being just the other.

374
00:14:32.64 --> 00:14:35.84
That I shouldn't be interacting with the world around me.

375
00:14:35.84 --> 00:14:37.16
So I put my head up.

376
00:14:37.16 --> 00:14:41.04
And I was like that one physical gesture of going,

377
00:14:41.04 --> 00:14:42.72
I am here.

378
00:14:42.72 --> 00:14:44.48
And I'm part of the equation.

379
00:14:44.48 --> 00:14:47.44
And then that slowly opens up your aperture.

380
00:14:47.44 --> 00:14:48.68
And you start looking around.

381
00:14:48.68 --> 00:14:49.64
And you're like, oh, what's going on here?

382
00:14:49.64 --> 00:14:50.48
Can I do something here?

383
00:14:50.48 --> 00:14:52.64
Can I do something there?

384
00:14:52.64 --> 00:14:55.52
The visual feedback that you get from another person

385
00:14:55.52 --> 00:14:57.84
actually enhances your ability to have a relationship with

386
00:14:57.84 --> 00:14:59.88
them, which I think is very important.

387
00:14:59.88 --> 00:15:03.80
That posture thing is huge. I had JP DeNel on this podcast.

388
00:15:03.80 --> 00:15:04.56
I work with him still.

389
00:15:04.56 --> 00:15:08.32
But I talked about, and this was a long time ago,

390
00:15:08.32 --> 00:15:09.92
I talked about the fact I was watching him.

391
00:15:09.92 --> 00:15:12.80
Like I'm sitting in a door well or something

392
00:15:12.80 --> 00:15:13.96
on a street in Ramadi.

393
00:15:13.96 --> 00:15:16.92
And I'm watching JP maneuver.

394
00:15:16.92 --> 00:15:20.68
And he's walking with his chest out, his head up.

395
00:15:20.68 --> 00:15:21.20
Like I'm here.

396
00:15:21.20 --> 00:15:22.28
Just like I'm here.

397
00:15:22.28 --> 00:15:23.36
I'm going to get it.

398
00:15:23.36 --> 00:15:26.52
And a lot of people, your instinct is to, especially

399
00:15:26.52 --> 00:15:29.36
in combat, is to get small.

400
00:15:29.36 --> 00:15:32.08
And he's like, no, chest up, head out.

401
00:15:32.08 --> 00:15:33.24
And that became a thing.

402
00:15:33.24 --> 00:15:34.24
This whole posture thing.

403
00:15:34.24 --> 00:15:37.44
I mean, Jordan Peterson talked about stand up straight with

404
00:15:37.44 --> 00:15:38.04
your shoulders back.

405
00:15:38.04 --> 00:15:39.96
I was like, oh, yeah, that was JP DeNel.

406
00:15:39.96 --> 00:15:43.36
And it sounds like you made that transition at 17 years old

407
00:15:43.36 --> 00:15:44.64
when someone said, dude, you're walking around

408
00:15:44.64 --> 00:15:45.16
with your head down.

409
00:15:45.16 --> 00:15:47.12
Yeah, that makes a difference.

410
00:15:47.12 --> 00:15:47.92
Yeah, it does.

411
00:15:47.92 --> 00:15:52.48
And I think that I don't think I know that people now, they

412
00:15:52.48 --> 00:15:57.60
can go, oh, this is a brash person.

413
00:15:57.60 --> 00:16:00.20
But when I sit down with them, talk to them, they understand

414
00:16:00.20 --> 00:16:02.40
that that's not posturing.

415
00:16:02.40 --> 00:16:03.88
It's posture.

416
00:16:03.88 --> 00:16:05.84
So then there's a difference between the two.

417
00:16:05.84 --> 00:16:08.84
One is something that's internalized, and the other

418
00:16:08.84 --> 00:16:10.92
one is a projection.

419
00:16:10.92 --> 00:16:14.12
So if you have posture that you've internalized that,

420
00:16:14.12 --> 00:16:15.52
you're posturing, you're pretending.

421
00:16:15.52 --> 00:16:19.76
I don't pretend about really anything.

422
00:16:19.76 --> 00:16:21.80
So you're going to high school.

423
00:16:21.80 --> 00:16:24.52
You're ostracized.

424
00:16:24.52 --> 00:16:26.96
And at some point, you say you decide to drop out of high

425
00:16:26.96 --> 00:16:27.48
school.

426
00:16:27.48 --> 00:16:30.92
The institution no longer had anything to offer me.

427
00:16:30.92 --> 00:16:33.60
That is a direct quote from Anna Walsh, I think.

428
00:16:33.60 --> 00:16:34.68
It's a direct quote from what?

429
00:16:34.68 --> 00:16:35.76
Animal house, I believe.

430
00:16:35.76 --> 00:16:36.88
OK.

431
00:16:36.88 --> 00:16:39.76
So you decide, what did your mom say about this?

432
00:16:39.76 --> 00:16:40.64
She was not happy.

433
00:16:40.64 --> 00:16:42.44
Yeah, I was going to say, there's no mom that's like, oh,

434
00:16:42.44 --> 00:16:43.40
cool, you're dropping out of high school.

435
00:16:43.40 --> 00:16:45.44
No, she was not happy at all.

436
00:16:45.44 --> 00:16:46.76
What was your plan?

437
00:16:46.76 --> 00:16:48.12
I didn't have one.

438
00:16:48.12 --> 00:16:49.24
Just on that phone at school anymore?

439
00:16:49.24 --> 00:16:50.20
I'm out.

440
00:16:50.20 --> 00:16:52.40
Had you already been working?

441
00:16:52.40 --> 00:16:55.72
Yeah, I started working, I think, when I was 14.

442
00:16:55.72 --> 00:16:57.04
And so what are you doing?

443
00:16:57.04 --> 00:16:58.44
I worked at a movie theater.

444
00:16:58.44 --> 00:16:58.64
Cool.

445
00:16:58.64 --> 00:17:00.64
And then I worked at a gas station.

446
00:17:00.64 --> 00:17:01.36
Roger?

447
00:17:01.36 --> 00:17:03.000
Yep, Chevron gas station.

448
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.68
Pound the gas, fixin' cars.

449
00:17:04.68 --> 00:17:08.60
And now you must, what's your reasoning behind dropping out

450
00:17:08.60 --> 00:17:09.16
of school?

451
00:17:09.16 --> 00:17:11.20
How you coming to this conclusion as a 16-year-old?

452
00:17:11.20 --> 00:17:14.76
It was, I don't think the environment was oppressive.

453
00:17:14.76 --> 00:17:17.76
I just didn't fit.

454
00:17:17.76 --> 00:17:20.52
And I just didn't want to be part of that.

455
00:17:20.52 --> 00:17:23.88
So you tell your mom, what was it in the school year?

456
00:17:23.88 --> 00:17:24.92
Was it in the summertime?

457
00:17:24.92 --> 00:17:28.72
It was two weeks into my sophomore year.

458
00:17:28.72 --> 00:17:29.76
I'm out.

459
00:17:29.76 --> 00:17:30.88
Yeah, I did.

460
00:17:30.88 --> 00:17:31.36
I'm out.

461
00:17:31.36 --> 00:17:33.36
And then I moved out.

462
00:17:33.36 --> 00:17:34.76
So what'd you get for a job?

463
00:17:34.76 --> 00:17:36.36
I was working at the gas station.

464
00:17:36.36 --> 00:17:36.86
Oh, OK.

465
00:17:36.86 --> 00:17:38.80
So the gas station job, you move into what?

466
00:17:38.80 --> 00:17:40.12
An apartment or something?

467
00:17:40.12 --> 00:17:42.08
Yeah.

468
00:17:42.08 --> 00:17:42.72
That was it.

469
00:17:42.72 --> 00:17:49.04
I mean, so do I recommend this life path?

470
00:17:49.04 --> 00:17:49.68
I did that.

471
00:17:49.68 --> 00:17:51.16
I got an undergraduate degree at 44.

472
00:17:51.16 --> 00:17:52.56
I got accepted to law school at 50,

473
00:17:52.56 --> 00:17:53.76
and all that sort of stuff.

474
00:17:53.76 --> 00:17:57.84
Would I recommend this path?

475
00:17:57.84 --> 00:18:00.28
That's a very complicated answer, because in some ways,

476
00:18:00.28 --> 00:18:01.16
I would say yes.

477
00:18:01.16 --> 00:18:02.64
In other ways, I would not.

478
00:18:02.64 --> 00:18:04.36
And I was thinking about this because I

479
00:18:04.36 --> 00:18:07.04
knew I was going to come talk to you.

480
00:18:07.04 --> 00:18:12.72
If you look at what's taking place in the world right now,

481
00:18:12.72 --> 00:18:17.56
I think if more people had more adversity growing up,

482
00:18:17.56 --> 00:18:20.68
that they would be able to thrive more.

483
00:18:20.68 --> 00:18:22.76
I mean, I'm going to get elected to Congress next year.

484
00:18:22.76 --> 00:18:23.56
That's happening.

485
00:18:23.56 --> 00:18:26.44
Actually, this year in November, I'll take office next year.

486
00:18:26.44 --> 00:18:29.56
And I started from the meanest circumstances you possibly can.

487
00:18:29.56 --> 00:18:32.52
I mean, abject real poverty, broken home, single mom,

488
00:18:32.52 --> 00:18:34.72
enlisted guy in the Navy.

489
00:18:34.72 --> 00:18:37.44
And I'm going to be in the highest levels of power

490
00:18:37.44 --> 00:18:39.48
in the most powerful country in the world

491
00:18:39.48 --> 00:18:42.04
within a single generation.

492
00:18:42.04 --> 00:18:46.04
I tell people all the time, man, what's that called?

493
00:18:46.04 --> 00:18:47.44
It's the American dream, right?

494
00:18:47.44 --> 00:18:49.80
I mean, the embodiment of the American dream.

495
00:18:49.80 --> 00:18:52.88
I lived on five of the seven continents as a frogman.

496
00:18:52.88 --> 00:18:54.76
Africa, I lived in villages.

497
00:18:54.76 --> 00:18:58.04
In Afghanistan, I lived in cosmopolitan European cities,

498
00:18:58.04 --> 00:19:00.60
Iraq, in Asia, everywhere.

499
00:19:00.60 --> 00:19:01.96
And it's the American dream, man.

500
00:19:01.96 --> 00:19:04.000
It's not the Argentinian dream.

501
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.72
It's not.

502
00:19:04.72 --> 00:19:05.92
It's not the English dream.

503
00:19:05.92 --> 00:19:06.28
It's not.

504
00:19:06.28 --> 00:19:08.20
It's the American dream because this is the only place

505
00:19:08.20 --> 00:19:10.72
my story can happen every day, like all the time.

506
00:19:10.72 --> 00:19:12.32
Look, it wins some serious.

507
00:19:12.32 --> 00:19:12.80
Yeah.

508
00:19:12.80 --> 00:19:13.20
Yeah.

509
00:19:13.20 --> 00:19:13.56
Amazing.

510
00:19:13.56 --> 00:19:14.56
Immigrant to the United States,

511
00:19:14.56 --> 00:19:16.60
she's the lieutenant governor of Virginia.

512
00:19:16.60 --> 00:19:21.24
So that's what I think is important about these growing up

513
00:19:21.24 --> 00:19:23.28
where things aren't handed to you as much.

514
00:19:23.28 --> 00:19:25.48
Because I fought for everything I've had,

515
00:19:25.48 --> 00:19:27.92
everything my entire life.

516
00:19:27.92 --> 00:19:29.32
And I know what that means.

517
00:19:29.32 --> 00:19:32.52
And then I can assign value to that.

518
00:19:32.52 --> 00:19:36.56
So I'm guessing you didn't quite see this trajectory

519
00:19:36.56 --> 00:19:39.88
when you were putting some premium gas into some guy's

520
00:19:39.88 --> 00:19:43.08
Chevy for $4.75 an hour.

521
00:19:43.08 --> 00:19:44.48
Because I worked at Wendy's.

522
00:19:44.48 --> 00:19:45.08
Did you really?

523
00:19:45.08 --> 00:19:45.44
Yeah.

524
00:19:45.44 --> 00:19:46.16
I worked at Wendy's.

525
00:19:46.16 --> 00:19:47.04
What did you do there?

526
00:19:47.04 --> 00:19:50.64
I was the burger cook guy, which I would

527
00:19:50.64 --> 00:19:51.44
make burgers.

528
00:19:51.44 --> 00:19:52.48
And it's interesting.

529
00:19:52.48 --> 00:19:54.08
You go to Wendy's, the burgers are fresh,

530
00:19:54.08 --> 00:19:56.08
which means when eight people walk in,

531
00:19:56.08 --> 00:19:57.76
they make a rough guess.

532
00:19:57.76 --> 00:19:58.08
Sure.

533
00:19:58.08 --> 00:19:59.56
And they'll go, put on 10.

534
00:19:59.56 --> 00:20:00.72
So you put on 10.

535
00:20:00.72 --> 00:20:03.000
And if two of them don't sell, they go into a bucket.

536
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.28
And that bucket gets turned into chili.

537
00:20:05.28 --> 00:20:05.80
But you know.

538
00:20:05.80 --> 00:20:06.60
I did not know that.

539
00:20:06.60 --> 00:20:07.04
Yeah.

540
00:20:07.04 --> 00:20:09.96
So I'm working at Wendy's.

541
00:20:09.96 --> 00:20:13.56
And I knew I wanted to go in the military at some point.

542
00:20:13.56 --> 00:20:16.60
At what point did the military seem like the call?

543
00:20:16.60 --> 00:20:18.28
Actually, let me hear the worst day

544
00:20:18.28 --> 00:20:23.92
of the 17-year-old van-o working at the gas station.

545
00:20:23.92 --> 00:20:25.80
Not eating.

546
00:20:25.80 --> 00:20:26.76
Just no food.

547
00:20:26.76 --> 00:20:28.76
Just not eating.

548
00:20:28.76 --> 00:20:29.52
Not enough money.

549
00:20:29.52 --> 00:20:31.36
You got to make rent.

550
00:20:31.36 --> 00:20:34.12
And I got to pay for gas for a car.

551
00:20:34.12 --> 00:20:39.36
I bought a, I'd say, 1969 Toyota Corona.

552
00:20:39.36 --> 00:20:40.12
Corona.

553
00:20:40.12 --> 00:20:40.60
Corona.

554
00:20:40.60 --> 00:20:41.08
Not a Corona.

555
00:20:41.08 --> 00:20:42.08
Corona.

556
00:20:42.08 --> 00:20:44.36
It was built in September, 1969, same month and year

557
00:20:44.36 --> 00:20:45.04
that I was born.

558
00:20:45.04 --> 00:20:46.76
It was red with a white racing straight, man.

559
00:20:46.76 --> 00:20:47.64
500 bucks.

560
00:20:47.64 --> 00:20:48.08
Boom.

561
00:20:48.08 --> 00:20:48.96
Cash on the back.

562
00:20:48.96 --> 00:20:50.24
On the barrel head, right?

563
00:20:50.24 --> 00:20:52.48
You got to pay for gas because you got to go to work.

564
00:20:52.48 --> 00:20:53.52
You got to make rent.

565
00:20:53.52 --> 00:20:55.44
And sometimes you don't have money for food.

566
00:20:55.44 --> 00:21:00.04
And what's tragic, Jaco, is that people are getting there,

567
00:21:00.04 --> 00:21:01.92
again, in America.

568
00:21:01.92 --> 00:21:03.60
They're having to make those decisions.

569
00:21:03.60 --> 00:21:04.24
And it's shocking.

570
00:21:04.24 --> 00:21:06.40
So yeah, not eating was, you know.

571
00:21:06.40 --> 00:21:08.48
I mean, right now, clearly, that's going to be a good thing,

572
00:21:08.48 --> 00:21:09.44
dude.

573
00:21:09.44 --> 00:21:11.36
I tell people, like, we're nine meals.

574
00:21:11.36 --> 00:21:12.96
Could use some more of that, right?

575
00:21:12.96 --> 00:21:15.60
We're like, we're nine meals away from Anarchy at any point,

576
00:21:15.60 --> 00:21:16.20
right?

577
00:21:16.20 --> 00:21:19.68
And I'm like, 15 to 20 meals away from Anarchy.

578
00:21:19.68 --> 00:21:22.16
Let's be honest.

579
00:21:22.16 --> 00:21:23.56
I could be a castler for a while.

580
00:21:23.56 --> 00:21:25.40
That may be a good thing.

581
00:21:25.40 --> 00:21:27.32
So sometimes you're not eating.

582
00:21:27.32 --> 00:21:28.20
You're 16.

583
00:21:28.20 --> 00:21:29.04
You're 17.

584
00:21:29.04 --> 00:21:30.40
You're still working at the gas station.

585
00:21:30.40 --> 00:21:31.52
At what point do you go?

586
00:21:31.52 --> 00:21:32.40
So I went out.

587
00:21:32.40 --> 00:21:33.12
This ain't working.

588
00:21:33.12 --> 00:21:33.60
Check.

589
00:21:33.60 --> 00:21:35.000
I went out with a buddy of mine.

590
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.28
His name was Kurt.

591
00:21:36.28 --> 00:21:39.68
And you know, we're trying to baron.

592
00:21:39.68 --> 00:21:40.92
We're in Oregon.

593
00:21:40.92 --> 00:21:43.16
And I'm like, let's join the Marine Corps.

594
00:21:43.16 --> 00:21:45.12
And he's like, yeah, let's join the Marine Corps.

595
00:21:45.12 --> 00:21:47.20
So we go out and we get all tuned up.

596
00:21:47.20 --> 00:21:50.88
And we're like the best Marines for six hours.

597
00:21:50.88 --> 00:21:52.52
And I wake up and I call him.

598
00:21:52.52 --> 00:21:54.56
I'm like, I do not want to join the Marine Corps.

599
00:21:54.56 --> 00:21:56.08
He's like, I do not want to join the Marine Corps.

600
00:21:56.08 --> 00:21:57.16
I go, let's join the Navy.

601
00:21:57.16 --> 00:21:58.56
He goes, OK.

602
00:21:58.56 --> 00:21:59.32
I picked him up.

603
00:21:59.32 --> 00:22:00.84
We went to their recruiting office.

604
00:22:00.84 --> 00:22:01.64
What?

605
00:22:01.64 --> 00:22:02.04
No.

606
00:22:02.04 --> 00:22:02.84
That was it.

607
00:22:02.84 --> 00:22:04.96
That was exactly as much thought that went into it.

608
00:22:04.96 --> 00:22:08.36
Now remember, now Gunny was, he was a Marine.

609
00:22:08.36 --> 00:22:11.12
My guy that I aspired to be.

610
00:22:11.12 --> 00:22:13.24
What made you say like you're fired up

611
00:22:13.24 --> 00:22:14.88
to go to the Marine Corps six hours later?

612
00:22:14.88 --> 00:22:15.48
I don't think so.

613
00:22:15.48 --> 00:22:17.36
What was?

614
00:22:17.36 --> 00:22:18.08
Sobriety.

615
00:22:18.08 --> 00:22:21.24
That's what happened.

616
00:22:21.24 --> 00:22:24.32
Did you understand anything about the military?

617
00:22:24.32 --> 00:22:29.08
And we're just like, hey, Navy, Marine Corps, that seems cool.

618
00:22:29.08 --> 00:22:31.08
They got cool uniforms.

619
00:22:31.08 --> 00:22:32.16
They carry machine guns.

620
00:22:32.16 --> 00:22:32.68
Yeah, no.

621
00:22:32.68 --> 00:22:33.48
And you know what?

622
00:22:33.48 --> 00:22:36.92
It's interesting if you want to, I mean, not to over-spiritualize

623
00:22:36.92 --> 00:22:38.92
things or get too philosophical about stuff.

624
00:22:38.92 --> 00:22:39.92
Sounds like we're about to.

625
00:22:39.92 --> 00:22:40.56
Sure.

626
00:22:40.56 --> 00:22:43.08
There's been several inflection points in my life.

627
00:22:43.08 --> 00:22:45.56
Or it's just kind of like, throw your chips to the wind

628
00:22:45.56 --> 00:22:46.88
and see what happens.

629
00:22:46.88 --> 00:22:48.80
Because at that point, I was going nowhere.

630
00:22:48.80 --> 00:22:50.32
And I realized that.

631
00:22:50.32 --> 00:22:54.40
I guess alcoholics call it an epiphany.

632
00:22:54.40 --> 00:22:56.40
You have this moment.

633
00:22:56.40 --> 00:23:02.20
And I kind of had that moment where I realized this is just not,

634
00:23:02.20 --> 00:23:05.08
I don't want to live this way the rest of my life.

635
00:23:05.08 --> 00:23:06.60
And so there had to be a change.

636
00:23:06.60 --> 00:23:08.68
And how do you change like that?

637
00:23:08.68 --> 00:23:09.80
I'm a high school dropout.

638
00:23:09.80 --> 00:23:10.84
I couldn't get accepted.

639
00:23:10.84 --> 00:23:13.48
I didn't know any of that stuff, right?

640
00:23:13.48 --> 00:23:16.04
And it just really, it was an epiphany.

641
00:23:16.04 --> 00:23:17.28
So I joined the Navy.

642
00:23:17.28 --> 00:23:18.52
Did you have to get your GED?

643
00:23:18.52 --> 00:23:19.32
How'd that work?

644
00:23:19.32 --> 00:23:21.32
I guess they gave me six months to get a GED.

645
00:23:21.32 --> 00:23:23.12
I was offered three different programs.

646
00:23:23.12 --> 00:23:25.48
Seaman apprenticeship, fireman apprenticeship,

647
00:23:25.48 --> 00:23:27.04
and airman apprenticeship.

648
00:23:27.04 --> 00:23:27.60
That's it.

649
00:23:27.60 --> 00:23:29.88
There was no other options.

650
00:23:29.88 --> 00:23:32.52
So just so everyone knows what that means, that means.

651
00:23:32.52 --> 00:23:33.64
Menial labor.

652
00:23:33.64 --> 00:23:36.36
The lowest jobs, the most menial jobs

653
00:23:36.36 --> 00:23:37.76
that you can get in the Navy.

654
00:23:37.76 --> 00:23:41.28
Those three jobs in the three different broad departments

655
00:23:41.28 --> 00:23:41.96
in the Navy.

656
00:23:41.96 --> 00:23:43.76
Yeah, straight up menial labor.

657
00:23:43.76 --> 00:23:48.60
And so I just like, OK, I signed on.

658
00:23:48.60 --> 00:23:50.72
I got stationed at Naval Weapons Station Concord.

659
00:23:50.72 --> 00:23:51.44
Hold on.

660
00:23:51.44 --> 00:23:52.000
Yeah, sorry.

661
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.80
You said it took you six months to get your GED before you

662
00:23:54.80 --> 00:23:55.80
could leave?

663
00:23:55.80 --> 00:24:00.16
They're like, so I wanted to dab the late entry program.

664
00:24:00.16 --> 00:24:02.20
They said once you're active duty, you have six months

665
00:24:02.20 --> 00:24:03.000
to get a GED.

666
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.16
So I went to my first duty station, Naval Weapons

667
00:24:05.16 --> 00:24:05.64
Station Concord.

668
00:24:05.64 --> 00:24:06.52
What year was this?

669
00:24:06.52 --> 00:24:07.56
1988.

670
00:24:07.56 --> 00:24:08.56
1988?

671
00:24:08.56 --> 00:24:10.32
Man, they were hurting for some people then.

672
00:24:10.32 --> 00:24:13.04
Listen, dude, Reagan wanted the 600 ship Navy.

673
00:24:13.04 --> 00:24:13.60
That's right.

674
00:24:13.60 --> 00:24:16.20
You could like, where's Harry Kimming's trenching?

675
00:24:16.20 --> 00:24:19.36
So you could like wipe the blood off a knife you just

676
00:24:19.36 --> 00:24:20.40
stabbed somebody with.

677
00:24:20.40 --> 00:24:21.92
And they're like, don't do that again.

678
00:24:21.92 --> 00:24:22.88
And they'll let you in the Navy.

679
00:24:22.88 --> 00:24:23.56
But come on in.

680
00:24:23.56 --> 00:24:24.04
Right.

681
00:24:24.04 --> 00:24:26.80
But now, that's something I was alluding to earlier,

682
00:24:26.80 --> 00:24:30.08
is that our standards now, people have not faced this

683
00:24:30.08 --> 00:24:31.20
adversity.

684
00:24:31.20 --> 00:24:34.28
And so we're taking, we're setting all these prerequisites

685
00:24:34.28 --> 00:24:35.96
for guys to go to different programs, especially

686
00:24:35.96 --> 00:24:36.92
specialized programs.

687
00:24:36.92 --> 00:24:39.04
That were kind of unrealistic.

688
00:24:39.04 --> 00:24:42.52
But yeah, so I would drive up over the Benisha Bridge.

689
00:24:42.52 --> 00:24:43.64
I can't remember the name of that.

690
00:24:43.64 --> 00:24:44.48
Meri Island.

691
00:24:44.48 --> 00:24:45.68
And I would take classes.

692
00:24:45.68 --> 00:24:49.04
And I took my GED and got that within the six months.

693
00:24:49.04 --> 00:24:51.24
So you were 18 when you actually get in the Navy?

694
00:24:51.24 --> 00:24:51.72
I was 18.

695
00:24:51.72 --> 00:24:53.12
I turned 19 in boot camp.

696
00:24:53.12 --> 00:24:53.68
OK.

697
00:24:53.68 --> 00:24:54.96
So you turned 19 in boot camp.

698
00:24:54.96 --> 00:24:57.12
How was boot camp?

699
00:24:57.12 --> 00:24:58.48
You know what I mean?

700
00:24:58.48 --> 00:24:59.68
It was just boot camp.

701
00:24:59.68 --> 00:25:01.48
Was it a shock to your system where you like?

702
00:25:01.48 --> 00:25:01.88
No.

703
00:25:01.88 --> 00:25:02.88
I was not one of those guys.

704
00:25:02.88 --> 00:25:05.52
Were you totally happy to be there?

705
00:25:05.52 --> 00:25:07.80
It's three hots and a cot, man.

706
00:25:07.80 --> 00:25:09.04
You like food.

707
00:25:09.04 --> 00:25:09.68
Yeah.

708
00:25:09.68 --> 00:25:13.68
I mean, yeah, apparently.

709
00:25:13.68 --> 00:25:17.12
Everyone understands what you're saying.

710
00:25:17.12 --> 00:25:19.72
So yeah, I mean, it was just what you're doing.

711
00:25:19.72 --> 00:25:22.84
And that's kind of how I live my life.

712
00:25:22.84 --> 00:25:23.36
I approach it.

713
00:25:23.36 --> 00:25:25.08
Like, this is what we're doing.

714
00:25:25.08 --> 00:25:26.84
And so let's just do it.

715
00:25:26.84 --> 00:25:29.56
Let's crack on and let's do it the best that we can.

716
00:25:29.56 --> 00:25:31.72
And that really paid off in buds.

717
00:25:31.72 --> 00:25:32.80
I'll tell you a story, though.

718
00:25:32.80 --> 00:25:35.36
So in order to get to buds, right,

719
00:25:35.36 --> 00:25:36.44
I joined the Navy.

720
00:25:36.44 --> 00:25:37.04
I'm working on my.

721
00:25:37.04 --> 00:25:38.40
Do you know about the seals at this point?

722
00:25:38.40 --> 00:25:40.52
I had no idea.

723
00:25:40.52 --> 00:25:41.96
They wasn't like, hey, Derek, check this out.

724
00:25:41.96 --> 00:25:42.92
By the way, you can never do this.

725
00:25:42.92 --> 00:25:45.08
You're going to be working on it because you're a scrub.

726
00:25:45.08 --> 00:25:46.40
That's essentially what I said.

727
00:25:46.40 --> 00:25:47.84
So I cleaned toilets and painted.

728
00:25:47.84 --> 00:25:49.72
So you get done with boot camp.

729
00:25:49.72 --> 00:25:50.92
Where do you get stationed?

730
00:25:50.92 --> 00:25:52.48
Naval weapons station, Concord.

731
00:25:52.48 --> 00:25:54.32
Concord, California, it's closed now.

732
00:25:54.32 --> 00:25:55.80
There's an ammunition station.

733
00:25:55.80 --> 00:25:56.32
You show up there.

734
00:25:56.32 --> 00:25:57.84
You're an E1.

735
00:25:57.84 --> 00:25:58.60
Maybe an E2.

736
00:25:58.60 --> 00:26:00.60
No, I made E2.

737
00:26:00.60 --> 00:26:01.16
I can't remember.

738
00:26:01.16 --> 00:26:01.88
E1, E2 doesn't matter.

739
00:26:01.88 --> 00:26:03.80
But you're a very low ranking individual.

740
00:26:03.80 --> 00:26:04.64
Right.

741
00:26:04.64 --> 00:26:07.92
But I still had this sort of, you know,

742
00:26:07.92 --> 00:26:11.92
I was a smart aleck, you know, to put it mildly.

743
00:26:11.92 --> 00:26:13.44
You're a smart aleck at 50.

744
00:26:13.44 --> 00:26:14.20
How old are you?

745
00:26:14.20 --> 00:26:14.84
53.

746
00:26:14.84 --> 00:26:16.16
You're a smart aleck at 53.

747
00:26:16.16 --> 00:26:19.32
When we worked together, you were a smart aleck at 40-something.

748
00:26:19.32 --> 00:26:22.32
So I can only imagine it was even worse when you were.

749
00:26:22.32 --> 00:26:24.60
Here's the difference, Jaco.

750
00:26:24.60 --> 00:26:26.88
I have now earned it.

751
00:26:26.88 --> 00:26:27.96
I've earned it.

752
00:26:27.96 --> 00:26:30.12
When I was a young man, I didn't.

753
00:26:30.12 --> 00:26:31.40
I was a brash young man.

754
00:26:31.40 --> 00:26:33.36
And I didn't have humility.

755
00:26:33.36 --> 00:26:37.44
And so I decided to go to core school

756
00:26:37.44 --> 00:26:39.32
because I had a friend who worked at the clinic.

757
00:26:39.32 --> 00:26:41.60
And I wanted to go do that.

758
00:26:41.60 --> 00:26:44.80
So I had to work for six months, eight months, or whatever.

759
00:26:44.80 --> 00:26:49.48
After hours, I struck for a rate for all your civilians

760
00:26:49.48 --> 00:26:51.52
that's applying for a job.

761
00:26:51.52 --> 00:26:54.12
Did you apply for the job as Corman?

762
00:26:54.12 --> 00:26:55.24
I was a, right.

763
00:26:55.24 --> 00:27:01.16
So I made BM3, Bosin's Mate, third class, decorating.

764
00:27:01.16 --> 00:27:03.56
And then I went and became a Corman.

765
00:27:03.56 --> 00:27:05.96
But so here was the turn.

766
00:27:05.96 --> 00:27:09.52
A quarter inch shackle turned my life around.

767
00:27:09.52 --> 00:27:11.32
And that's a shackle.

768
00:27:11.32 --> 00:27:12.92
I don't know how to describe that.

769
00:27:12.92 --> 00:27:14.04
It's a fastener.

770
00:27:14.04 --> 00:27:16.68
It's a fastest and not a metal thing, right?

771
00:27:16.68 --> 00:27:20.72
So I was standing on the fan tail of the YTB.

772
00:27:20.72 --> 00:27:24.96
That's Yard Tug Boat 828, Karakasa, all yard tug boats

773
00:27:24.96 --> 00:27:27.32
in the Navy were named after American Indian chiefs,

774
00:27:27.32 --> 00:27:28.60
in case you're wondering.

775
00:27:28.60 --> 00:27:31.20
So I'm on the fan tail, that's the back of the boat.

776
00:27:31.20 --> 00:27:33.64
And I get beamed in the back of the head

777
00:27:33.64 --> 00:27:35.96
with a quarter inch shackle.

778
00:27:35.96 --> 00:27:39.92
And I turn around and there's nobody there.

779
00:27:39.92 --> 00:27:42.60
And I'm like, if I don't change my ways,

780
00:27:42.60 --> 00:27:45.44
these people will kill me.

781
00:27:45.44 --> 00:27:48.28
And that really opened.

782
00:27:48.28 --> 00:27:49.76
That was a reality check.

783
00:27:49.76 --> 00:27:53.12
And I don't encourage changing people's behavior

784
00:27:53.12 --> 00:27:55.000
modification through violence, but I'm just

785
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.88
telling you my story.

786
00:27:56.88 --> 00:28:04.48
And I was like, wow, I need to change my ways now.

787
00:28:04.48 --> 00:28:06.12
And I did.

788
00:28:06.12 --> 00:28:07.72
And then I got to course school.

789
00:28:07.72 --> 00:28:09.96
So you have to apply to go to course school?

790
00:28:09.96 --> 00:28:10.52
Oh, yeah, yeah.

791
00:28:10.52 --> 00:28:13.64
So I worked at the clinic on base after hours.

792
00:28:13.64 --> 00:28:15.64
And it was like six or eight months.

793
00:28:15.64 --> 00:28:17.12
And I had to take a series of tests.

794
00:28:17.12 --> 00:28:19.84
I did all these general military trainings.

795
00:28:19.84 --> 00:28:21.52
I did a whole bunch of correspondence courses,

796
00:28:21.52 --> 00:28:24.28
like the NATO handbook on surgery and all these things,

797
00:28:24.28 --> 00:28:27.000
which is a course for physicians.

798
00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:27.60
I ordered it.

799
00:28:27.60 --> 00:28:30.000
Used to be able to order all these books through the Navy.

800
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.92
And I just have a knack for it.

801
00:28:32.92 --> 00:28:36.44
I know I seem like a goofball, but I'm actually

802
00:28:36.44 --> 00:28:39.40
a knack for nerding out and studying on something

803
00:28:39.40 --> 00:28:40.16
and passing tests.

804
00:28:40.16 --> 00:28:41.88
Because I had been reading since a kid.

805
00:28:41.88 --> 00:28:43.24
You know what I mean?

806
00:28:43.24 --> 00:28:46.20
It wasn't strange to me to garner knowledge

807
00:28:46.20 --> 00:28:47.84
from the written word.

808
00:28:47.84 --> 00:28:51.12
And so being able to read things, absorb information,

809
00:28:51.12 --> 00:28:54.64
and then take things from disparate sources,

810
00:28:54.64 --> 00:28:57.16
combine them together to understand the best way

811
00:28:57.16 --> 00:28:59.96
to do things is just something I'm just good at.

812
00:28:59.96 --> 00:29:01.24
It's intuitive to me.

813
00:29:01.24 --> 00:29:02.88
I don't have to work at that.

814
00:29:02.88 --> 00:29:04.88
So you apply to go to course school?

815
00:29:04.88 --> 00:29:05.36
Right.

816
00:29:05.36 --> 00:29:07.000
And then I got accepted.

817
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.36
And I put everything I owned in the entire world

818
00:29:09.36 --> 00:29:13.20
on the back of my motorcycle and drove like everything.

819
00:29:13.20 --> 00:29:16.000
Drove from Concord, California to San Diego

820
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.96
and checked into course school later.

821
00:29:17.96 --> 00:29:20.44
How long is course school?

822
00:29:20.44 --> 00:29:22.32
About 11 weeks, I think.

823
00:29:22.32 --> 00:29:24.32
I mean, that was a while ago, dude.

824
00:29:24.32 --> 00:29:25.64
They didn't even have course school here anymore.

825
00:29:25.64 --> 00:29:27.52
And you still haven't heard about the SEAL teams yet?

826
00:29:27.52 --> 00:29:27.92
No.

827
00:29:27.92 --> 00:29:28.16
So I did.

828
00:29:28.16 --> 00:29:29.56
So that revelation must be coming.

829
00:29:29.56 --> 00:29:30.48
OK.

830
00:29:30.48 --> 00:29:37.000
So there was three guys that joined the Navy to be SEALs.

831
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.28
One's name is Rodney.

832
00:29:38.28 --> 00:29:41.000
Unfortunately, he was killed working for the CIA

833
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.12
after he got out of the teams.

834
00:29:42.12 --> 00:29:43.36
He graduated.

835
00:29:43.36 --> 00:29:44.76
Another one's name is Andy.

836
00:29:44.76 --> 00:29:45.20
He did.

837
00:29:45.20 --> 00:29:46.68
I don't know, ex-money ears got out.

838
00:29:46.68 --> 00:29:48.04
And the other one's name is Jeff.

839
00:29:48.04 --> 00:29:50.36
And Jeff didn't make it to Buds.

840
00:29:50.36 --> 00:29:52.52
Anyway, they're like, hey, I'm going to be a SEAL.

841
00:29:52.52 --> 00:29:53.32
This is at course school?

842
00:29:53.32 --> 00:29:54.76
This is at course school.

843
00:29:54.76 --> 00:29:56.92
And they're all like, brrr.

844
00:29:56.92 --> 00:29:58.20
And I'm me.

845
00:29:58.20 --> 00:30:00.92
And I'm like, what's the SEAL stuff?

846
00:30:00.92 --> 00:30:03.64
They're like, well, you have guns and planes and boats

847
00:30:03.64 --> 00:30:05.64
and fast cars.

848
00:30:05.64 --> 00:30:07.16
I'm like, well, I'll go do that.

849
00:30:07.16 --> 00:30:10.40
And they're like, you can't just say I'll go do that.

850
00:30:10.40 --> 00:30:11.88
And I go, well, why not?

851
00:30:11.88 --> 00:30:14.40
Why can't you just say I'll go do that?

852
00:30:14.40 --> 00:30:16.76
So I was kind of mocked a bit.

853
00:30:16.76 --> 00:30:20.68
And then you had, at that point, three chances to take

854
00:30:20.68 --> 00:30:22.36
this screening test.

855
00:30:22.36 --> 00:30:23.40
Did you do the same thing?

856
00:30:23.40 --> 00:30:24.24
What class were you?

857
00:30:24.24 --> 00:30:25.24
177.

858
00:30:25.24 --> 00:30:26.92
OK, so I was 184.

859
00:30:26.92 --> 00:30:28.36
And so remember you had three chances.

860
00:30:28.36 --> 00:30:30.20
Oh, no, you're eating, weren't you?

861
00:30:30.20 --> 00:30:31.04
Yeah, yeah.

862
00:30:31.04 --> 00:30:32.40
I just did it in boot camp.

863
00:30:32.40 --> 00:30:34.48
Oh, because they let you do that.

864
00:30:34.48 --> 00:30:35.48
Yeah.

865
00:30:35.48 --> 00:30:36.96
Yeah.

866
00:30:36.96 --> 00:30:38.52
I did it in boot camp, passed.

867
00:30:38.52 --> 00:30:41.52
Yeah, so I failed this twice.

868
00:30:41.52 --> 00:30:43.88
And back then, like you failed the street times, you're out.

869
00:30:43.88 --> 00:30:44.64
We don't want to see you again.

870
00:30:44.64 --> 00:30:45.88
You're dead to the world.

871
00:30:45.88 --> 00:30:46.72
Get out of here.

872
00:30:46.72 --> 00:30:47.96
This is while you were a corpsman?

873
00:30:47.96 --> 00:30:49.40
This is while I was in core school.

874
00:30:49.40 --> 00:30:50.16
I was in a corpsman.

875
00:30:50.16 --> 00:30:50.88
To get billet to buds.

876
00:30:50.88 --> 00:30:51.76
To get a billet to buds.

877
00:30:51.76 --> 00:30:52.44
Got it.

878
00:30:52.44 --> 00:30:53.80
And you failed once.

879
00:30:53.80 --> 00:30:54.76
What'd you fail?

880
00:30:54.76 --> 00:30:55.36
Swim.

881
00:30:55.36 --> 00:30:55.72
OK.

882
00:30:55.72 --> 00:30:57.08
I didn't know how to do the side stroke.

883
00:30:57.08 --> 00:31:00.12
I've been swimming since I was a kid.

884
00:31:00.12 --> 00:31:02.16
I just don't know how to do a formal stroke.

885
00:31:02.16 --> 00:31:04.80
So I failed this thing twice.

886
00:31:04.80 --> 00:31:06.80
And they started renovating the barracks, which

887
00:31:06.80 --> 00:31:10.52
is not the oldest, but the second oldest building in San

888
00:31:10.52 --> 00:31:12.04
Diego at the Naval Hospital.

889
00:31:12.04 --> 00:31:13.32
That was our barracks.

890
00:31:13.32 --> 00:31:17.16
So they move us to 32nd Street, the Navy based on there.

891
00:31:17.16 --> 00:31:20.20
And by now, this is a personal thing at this point,

892
00:31:20.20 --> 00:31:23.32
because the push-ups, sit-ups, run.

893
00:31:23.32 --> 00:31:24.40
I don't know if you did dips.

894
00:31:24.40 --> 00:31:26.32
Anyway, crush all of them.

895
00:31:26.32 --> 00:31:27.12
Crush all of them.

896
00:31:27.12 --> 00:31:28.40
Can't do the swim.

897
00:31:28.40 --> 00:31:29.40
So I go to the pool.

898
00:31:29.40 --> 00:31:31.84
There's a nine-year-old kid in the pool.

899
00:31:31.84 --> 00:31:33.84
And he's doing the side stroke.

900
00:31:33.84 --> 00:31:35.84
And I'm like, hey, dude, can you show me?

901
00:31:35.84 --> 00:31:37.36
Because there was no mentoring.

902
00:31:37.36 --> 00:31:37.80
Remember that?

903
00:31:37.80 --> 00:31:39.12
It was like, go do this.

904
00:31:39.12 --> 00:31:39.84
No mentoring.

905
00:31:39.84 --> 00:31:42.56
I go, hey, man, can you show me how to do that?

906
00:31:42.56 --> 00:31:44.04
A nine-year-old kid.

907
00:31:44.04 --> 00:31:45.24
He's like, yeah.

908
00:31:45.24 --> 00:31:46.88
Just grab an apple, pull the apple down.

909
00:31:46.88 --> 00:31:48.48
Get it with your hand through the apple way.

910
00:31:48.48 --> 00:31:49.28
Grab another apple.

911
00:31:49.28 --> 00:31:50.08
Oh, no, man.

912
00:31:50.08 --> 00:31:50.92
Look at that.

913
00:31:50.92 --> 00:31:52.12
This kid was good.

914
00:31:52.12 --> 00:31:52.62
Right.

915
00:31:52.62 --> 00:31:53.76
That's a side stroke.

916
00:31:53.76 --> 00:31:57.000
So I did it past the test.

917
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.96
That quarter in shackle gave me the humility, which

918
00:32:00.96 --> 00:32:03.04
was the thing that I was missing as a young man,

919
00:32:03.04 --> 00:32:06.28
to be able to ask a nine-year-old kid how to do the side

920
00:32:06.28 --> 00:32:07.88
stroke.

921
00:32:07.88 --> 00:32:08.36
And then I went.

922
00:32:08.36 --> 00:32:10.44
So somebody hawked that thing at you, this shackle?

923
00:32:10.44 --> 00:32:11.36
Yeah.

924
00:32:11.36 --> 00:32:13.08
And they just didn't give a shit.

925
00:32:13.08 --> 00:32:14.28
No.

926
00:32:14.28 --> 00:32:15.64
Listen, man.

927
00:32:15.64 --> 00:32:19.16
I mean, right in the back of the head.

928
00:32:19.16 --> 00:32:21.68
And then so, you know, there's a type of which

929
00:32:21.68 --> 00:32:22.96
are actually beautiful boats.

930
00:32:22.96 --> 00:32:24.64
There's big wide and phantome on the back.

931
00:32:24.64 --> 00:32:26.56
And then there's the old one level,

932
00:32:26.56 --> 00:32:32.88
which is where the coxswain's flat is, the wheelhouse.

933
00:32:32.88 --> 00:32:35.88
Clearly, they were up there.

934
00:32:35.88 --> 00:32:37.92
So I've had the ability, Jaco.

935
00:32:37.92 --> 00:32:39.68
And I think you have also an echo.

936
00:32:39.68 --> 00:32:41.48
Unfortunately, I don't know you well enough.

937
00:32:41.48 --> 00:32:42.48
I'm hopefully well.

938
00:32:42.48 --> 00:32:42.96
I don't.

939
00:32:42.96 --> 00:32:45.48
Whatever you're going to say, I doubt he has.

940
00:32:45.48 --> 00:32:48.16
There's people in the world that have the ability

941
00:32:48.16 --> 00:32:50.08
to understand when they're taking part in history

942
00:32:50.08 --> 00:32:52.20
or things that are significant to the point where

943
00:32:52.20 --> 00:32:54.16
that you should modify your behavior.

944
00:32:54.16 --> 00:32:55.24
Well, that's what I think.

945
00:32:55.24 --> 00:32:59.40
One of the key points about this is a lot of times,

946
00:32:59.40 --> 00:33:02.04
when you get hit in the head with a shackle,

947
00:33:02.04 --> 00:33:03.76
you look at everyone else and say,

948
00:33:03.76 --> 00:33:06.64
I can't believe they're doing this to me.

949
00:33:06.64 --> 00:33:07.92
I can't believe that someone.

950
00:33:07.92 --> 00:33:08.52
You get mad.

951
00:33:08.52 --> 00:33:09.88
You get mad at the Navy.

952
00:33:09.88 --> 00:33:12.68
You get mad at the people on your tugboat.

953
00:33:12.68 --> 00:33:15.60
You get mad at everybody else.

954
00:33:15.60 --> 00:33:17.92
When what you actually need to do is say, well,

955
00:33:17.92 --> 00:33:20.32
there's only one person I can control, and that's me.

956
00:33:20.32 --> 00:33:23.20
I'm the one that got myself on the back of this tugboat.

957
00:33:23.20 --> 00:33:25.40
I'm the one that got myself around these bunch of people.

958
00:33:25.40 --> 00:33:26.80
I need you something to get out of here.

959
00:33:26.80 --> 00:33:29.36
I need to take ownership of my life and move forward.

960
00:33:29.36 --> 00:33:31.36
And that's a huge difference.

961
00:33:31.36 --> 00:33:33.64
And it's a huge difference in mentality

962
00:33:33.64 --> 00:33:36.88
that can be the difference between staying where you're at.

963
00:33:36.88 --> 00:33:39.32
I mean, you obviously did the same thing at the gas station.

964
00:33:39.32 --> 00:33:42.36
At some point, you're like, you know, being hungry sucks.

965
00:33:42.36 --> 00:33:44.52
And I could be mad at my paycheck at the gas station.

966
00:33:44.52 --> 00:33:48.24
I could be mad at my car for using gas.

967
00:33:48.24 --> 00:33:50.40
Or I could say, hey, I put myself in this situation.

968
00:33:50.40 --> 00:33:51.68
I need to get myself out of it.

969
00:33:51.68 --> 00:33:53.36
Where's the recruiter?

970
00:33:53.36 --> 00:33:57.20
So that's the thing that you're talking about when

971
00:33:57.20 --> 00:33:58.16
you explain that to me.

972
00:33:58.16 --> 00:33:59.60
I think, yeah, well, that's going to have,

973
00:33:59.60 --> 00:34:02.68
that's the difference between moving forward, moving up,

974
00:34:02.68 --> 00:34:06.48
improving your station and life, or staying where you're at.

975
00:34:06.48 --> 00:34:07.40
Yeah.

976
00:34:07.40 --> 00:34:12.88
And if you have the wherewithal to do things,

977
00:34:12.88 --> 00:34:14.32
you should do things.

978
00:34:14.32 --> 00:34:16.48
I mean, some things are just that simple.

979
00:34:16.48 --> 00:34:20.76
You can sit around and hang out, or you can continuously

980
00:34:20.76 --> 00:34:22.56
try to improve yourself.

981
00:34:22.56 --> 00:34:24.12
And so I've got friends like that.

982
00:34:24.12 --> 00:34:26.52
One of them I got to give a shout out to is Mike Emmer.

983
00:34:26.52 --> 00:34:28.80
He's a dude up in our village in Butternut.

984
00:34:28.80 --> 00:34:30.20
He's just always doing things.

985
00:34:30.20 --> 00:34:32.20
He just got into sailing with his family now.

986
00:34:32.20 --> 00:34:33.44
So he sails in.

987
00:34:33.44 --> 00:34:37.56
This is a farmer who now has this big boat, sailboat,

988
00:34:37.56 --> 00:34:40.88
that he runs his kids around Lake Superior

989
00:34:40.88 --> 00:34:44.76
because he is always, him and Liz, she's just wonderful,

990
00:34:44.76 --> 00:34:46.80
have always kept their eyes open.

991
00:34:46.80 --> 00:34:48.76
And when people have their head down,

992
00:34:48.76 --> 00:34:50.44
we talk about that earlier with your posture,

993
00:34:50.44 --> 00:34:52.68
you just don't see the world around you.

994
00:34:52.68 --> 00:34:57.40
And I made a conscious decision to not do that.

995
00:34:57.40 --> 00:35:01.52
I made a conscious decision to be part of the equation.

996
00:35:01.52 --> 00:35:06.24
And I think more people, they should understand that.

997
00:35:06.24 --> 00:35:07.68
Not to get overly political here,

998
00:35:07.68 --> 00:35:12.60
but I talk to people, I'm like, hey, you can go outside

999
00:35:12.60 --> 00:35:14.24
and you can stare at a hill.

1000
00:35:14.24 --> 00:35:15.80
It doesn't matter how long you look at that.

1001
00:35:15.80 --> 00:35:17.56
The Calvary's not coming over the hill.

1002
00:35:17.56 --> 00:35:19.48
They're not coming.

1003
00:35:19.48 --> 00:35:20.12
It's you.

1004
00:35:20.12 --> 00:35:21.88
You are the Calvary.

1005
00:35:21.88 --> 00:35:24.36
So when you care enough about something,

1006
00:35:24.36 --> 00:35:27.16
you've got to understand you are the person that

1007
00:35:27.16 --> 00:35:28.60
can affect positive change.

1008
00:35:28.60 --> 00:35:29.76
And so I empower people.

1009
00:35:29.76 --> 00:35:30.52
And I go talk to them.

1010
00:35:30.52 --> 00:35:33.24
I go, look, man, we always talk about the guys

1011
00:35:33.24 --> 00:35:35.72
jumped into San Maria Gliese or whenever the beach is in Normandy

1012
00:35:35.72 --> 00:35:37.96
or the Marines in Quezon and Vietnam

1013
00:35:37.96 --> 00:35:41.48
or in the Argonne Forest in World War I.

1014
00:35:41.48 --> 00:35:45.16
We think about them as these people that at the singular point

1015
00:35:45.16 --> 00:35:47.80
in time when their country, our country needed them,

1016
00:35:47.80 --> 00:35:49.32
they stood up.

1017
00:35:49.32 --> 00:35:52.000
And they bodily entered into something

1018
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.76
knowing that they may not come back alive.

1019
00:35:56.28 --> 00:36:00.28
In the same vein, that's who the people that care

1020
00:36:00.28 --> 00:36:01.68
about the United States are now.

1021
00:36:01.68 --> 00:36:02.96
Now, I hope to God they never have

1022
00:36:02.96 --> 00:36:04.68
to get involved in physical combat.

1023
00:36:04.68 --> 00:36:05.68
We've both been there.

1024
00:36:05.68 --> 00:36:07.24
And it's a horrible thing.

1025
00:36:07.24 --> 00:36:09.04
And war should be horrible so people

1026
00:36:09.04 --> 00:36:10.64
don't want to get engaged in it.

1027
00:36:10.64 --> 00:36:13.08
But they're doing that now.

1028
00:36:13.08 --> 00:36:16.48
And they have to show courage because courage is contagious.

1029
00:36:16.48 --> 00:36:17.44
We've seen this.

1030
00:36:17.44 --> 00:36:19.64
A lot of people out in the civilian world have not.

1031
00:36:19.64 --> 00:36:22.40
And I'll give them an example that people can understand

1032
00:36:22.40 --> 00:36:23.84
because it's kind of funny.

1033
00:36:23.84 --> 00:36:29.92
During the lockdown, I think it's 323.10.

1034
00:36:29.92 --> 00:36:32.12
It was this statute in the Wisconsin state law

1035
00:36:32.12 --> 00:36:34.28
that says that the governor has the ability

1036
00:36:34.28 --> 00:36:36.28
to exercise emergency powers.

1037
00:36:36.28 --> 00:36:37.56
It's like a 30-day window.

1038
00:36:37.56 --> 00:36:38.60
So I'm like, OK, check.

1039
00:36:38.60 --> 00:36:39.72
I don't know what's going on.

1040
00:36:39.72 --> 00:36:42.12
It's like, if your dude's in combat, you're like, go do this.

1041
00:36:42.12 --> 00:36:45.16
It's like, well, sir, I think we should have an emergency

1042
00:36:45.16 --> 00:36:45.72
situation.

1043
00:36:45.72 --> 00:36:46.20
Boom.

1044
00:36:46.20 --> 00:36:46.80
Got it.

1045
00:36:46.80 --> 00:36:50.60
But then when that emergency ends or the legal authority ends,

1046
00:36:50.60 --> 00:36:51.80
then it's time to challenge authority.

1047
00:36:51.80 --> 00:36:55.28
The same person that is a law-buying citizen,

1048
00:36:55.28 --> 00:36:57.92
that's your duty to follow the law when you're

1049
00:36:57.92 --> 00:36:59.80
in a crisis situation.

1050
00:36:59.80 --> 00:37:02.64
It's the same person that says, no.

1051
00:37:02.64 --> 00:37:07.32
When that expires, that is your duty as a citizen.

1052
00:37:07.32 --> 00:37:08.88
It's to stand up for what's right.

1053
00:37:08.88 --> 00:37:12.24
Anyway, so this lockdown is going on.

1054
00:37:12.24 --> 00:37:14.92
And I'm like, I'm no longer compliant.

1055
00:37:14.92 --> 00:37:16.76
The legal authority has expired.

1056
00:37:16.76 --> 00:37:17.48
I will not do this.

1057
00:37:17.48 --> 00:37:18.12
I'm not.

1058
00:37:18.12 --> 00:37:21.88
So I go to Walmart because I'm a smelly, dirty Walmart shopper.

1059
00:37:21.88 --> 00:37:22.52
I am.

1060
00:37:22.52 --> 00:37:23.44
And I don't have a mask on.

1061
00:37:23.44 --> 00:37:24.44
And someone recognizes me.

1062
00:37:24.44 --> 00:37:28.16
They have a face shield and a mask on.

1063
00:37:28.16 --> 00:37:31.24
And the dude looks at me and he's like, what are you doing?

1064
00:37:31.24 --> 00:37:33.76
I go, I'm not complying.

1065
00:37:33.76 --> 00:37:35.44
And he said, well, I'm not either.

1066
00:37:35.44 --> 00:37:38.36
And he takes his stuff out and throws it into his cart

1067
00:37:38.36 --> 00:37:39.80
in Walmart.

1068
00:37:39.80 --> 00:37:42.20
And courage is contagious.

1069
00:37:42.20 --> 00:37:43.80
Wait, he didn't die immediately?

1070
00:37:43.80 --> 00:37:44.04
No.

1071
00:37:44.04 --> 00:37:47.44
But listen, don't get me wrong.

1072
00:37:47.44 --> 00:37:49.000
I had COVID twice.

1073
00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.72
And it was horrible.

1074
00:37:50.72 --> 00:37:52.28
And a lot of people died from it.

1075
00:37:52.28 --> 00:37:54.28
And if you want to wear a mask right now, wear it.

1076
00:37:54.28 --> 00:37:55.08
I mean, 100%.

1077
00:37:55.08 --> 00:37:56.80
If you want to wear a mask and a face shield,

1078
00:37:56.80 --> 00:37:59.14
you want to wear gloves, you want to hand sanitize,

1079
00:37:59.14 --> 00:38:01.64
and all that stuff, that's your ability as an American citizen

1080
00:38:01.64 --> 00:38:04.44
to choose the way you want to live your life.

1081
00:38:04.44 --> 00:38:05.92
And now everybody's coming around.

1082
00:38:05.92 --> 00:38:07.28
The CDC just said that.

1083
00:38:07.28 --> 00:38:08.48
People should be able to choose.

1084
00:38:08.48 --> 00:38:09.88
So they should have been able to choose.

1085
00:38:09.88 --> 00:38:12.52
Back then, I wrote an op-ed in April of 2020

1086
00:38:12.52 --> 00:38:14.24
called Freedom of War for Fear.

1087
00:38:14.24 --> 00:38:16.48
And it laid it out like, you got to pick.

1088
00:38:16.48 --> 00:38:17.84
Because you can't have both.

1089
00:38:17.84 --> 00:38:19.92
What's your book?

1090
00:38:19.92 --> 00:38:20.92
Extreme Ownership?

1091
00:38:20.92 --> 00:38:21.80
Well, there's a bunch of them.

1092
00:38:21.80 --> 00:38:22.88
The Icon of Leadership?

1093
00:38:22.88 --> 00:38:24.56
But you talk about fear and stuff, right?

1094
00:38:24.56 --> 00:38:26.000
Oh, Like You the Dragons.

1095
00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.72
The Kids Book.

1096
00:38:26.72 --> 00:38:29.04
OK, Mindkiller, right?

1097
00:38:29.04 --> 00:38:31.60
You can't function if you're terrified.

1098
00:38:31.60 --> 00:38:34.68
So I think it's just a different way

1099
00:38:34.68 --> 00:38:38.24
of thinking about how we should interact as citizens.

1100
00:38:38.24 --> 00:38:40.24
And so you want to do that stuff, go ahead.

1101
00:38:40.24 --> 00:38:41.16
I'm just not going to.

1102
00:38:41.16 --> 00:38:42.04
I will not join you.

1103
00:38:42.04 --> 00:38:46.12
But I won't mock you either, because it's your choice.

1104
00:38:46.12 --> 00:38:47.84
All right, speaking of your choices,

1105
00:38:47.84 --> 00:38:50.24
you choose to figure out how to swim from this nine-year-old

1106
00:38:50.24 --> 00:38:50.72
kid.

1107
00:38:50.72 --> 00:38:51.80
Now you pass your test.

1108
00:38:51.80 --> 00:38:52.68
I pass my test.

1109
00:38:52.68 --> 00:38:54.84
And you're going to Buds.

1110
00:38:54.84 --> 00:38:56.96
I go to Buds.

1111
00:38:56.96 --> 00:38:59.28
Did you have any clue about Buds at this point?

1112
00:38:59.28 --> 00:39:00.12
Absolutely nothing.

1113
00:39:00.12 --> 00:39:03.24
And again, that's why I succeeded.

1114
00:39:03.24 --> 00:39:05.20
So I do it.

1115
00:39:05.20 --> 00:39:07.44
184 and graduated with 184.

1116
00:39:07.44 --> 00:39:09.88
Neil Roberts, first guy killed in Afghanistan.

1117
00:39:09.88 --> 00:39:10.48
We have got our.

1118
00:39:10.48 --> 00:39:11.56
I was a team two with him, yeah.

1119
00:39:11.56 --> 00:39:13.32
OK, so we had our arms over each other's shoulders

1120
00:39:13.32 --> 00:39:15.20
graduating from Buds.

1121
00:39:15.20 --> 00:39:16.32
I mean, he's a great man.

1122
00:39:16.32 --> 00:39:18.04
They call him Thiefy.

1123
00:39:18.04 --> 00:39:19.44
Yeah, super guy.

1124
00:39:19.44 --> 00:39:22.16
But so I got there and I'm like, I don't know what to do here.

1125
00:39:22.16 --> 00:39:25.60
And I show up at like, you go to A.B. Brights.

1126
00:39:25.60 --> 00:39:26.44
Is that still there?

1127
00:39:26.44 --> 00:39:27.04
That area cleaner?

1128
00:39:27.04 --> 00:39:27.52
Yeah, OK.

1129
00:39:27.52 --> 00:39:31.64
So you've got your pants that you can stand up by themselves.

1130
00:39:31.64 --> 00:39:32.84
Because they're so starched.

1131
00:39:32.84 --> 00:39:34.28
Like, seriously, that's not a joke.

1132
00:39:34.28 --> 00:39:35.60
You can stand them up.

1133
00:39:35.60 --> 00:39:38.28
And so it's like, I pay all this money

1134
00:39:38.28 --> 00:39:40.04
to have these things done.

1135
00:39:40.04 --> 00:39:41.92
And I go down.

1136
00:39:41.92 --> 00:39:42.44
I'm not going to say.

1137
00:39:42.44 --> 00:39:43.96
I don't know what his first name is.

1138
00:39:43.96 --> 00:39:46.96
I'll just call him C. That's the first letter of his last name.

1139
00:39:46.96 --> 00:39:48.84
I don't know what a embarrassing guy.

1140
00:39:48.84 --> 00:39:50.92
And it's like four in the morning.

1141
00:39:50.92 --> 00:39:52.28
I'm wearing this uniform.

1142
00:39:52.28 --> 00:39:54.80
And I'm walking like, what is that?

1143
00:39:54.80 --> 00:39:57.04
Pillsbury Doeboarder, anyway.

1144
00:39:57.04 --> 00:39:58.80
Or Gingerbread Man or whatever.

1145
00:39:58.80 --> 00:40:02.16
And this guy comes up to me and he looks me up and down.

1146
00:40:02.16 --> 00:40:03.28
This is an instructor?

1147
00:40:03.28 --> 00:40:03.80
No.

1148
00:40:03.80 --> 00:40:05.36
This is a fellow student.

1149
00:40:05.36 --> 00:40:06.32
He looks me up and down.

1150
00:40:06.32 --> 00:40:09.68
He goes, you're not going to make it.

1151
00:40:09.68 --> 00:40:11.48
Like whispers to me.

1152
00:40:11.48 --> 00:40:14.000
And I'm like, well, what do I do now?

1153
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.32
I pay all this money for these uniforms.

1154
00:40:16.32 --> 00:40:17.92
Like, do I get a refund?

1155
00:40:17.92 --> 00:40:20.24
Or do I leave?

1156
00:40:20.24 --> 00:40:22.08
And so I'm like, all right.

1157
00:40:22.08 --> 00:40:24.40
Well, I guess I'm not going to make it.

1158
00:40:24.40 --> 00:40:26.36
And so I go to class.

1159
00:40:26.36 --> 00:40:28.60
And you know, one thing leads to another.

1160
00:40:28.60 --> 00:40:29.88
And it's very difficult.

1161
00:40:29.88 --> 00:40:34.000
Seal training in case you haven't read a book or anything.

1162
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.08
And then it occurred to me.

1163
00:40:35.08 --> 00:40:37.24
I mean, I actually have a more, again, another one

1164
00:40:37.24 --> 00:40:40.84
of these epiphanies, when I understand exactly what the deal

1165
00:40:40.84 --> 00:40:42.60
is.

1166
00:40:42.60 --> 00:40:44.52
We're sitting on the beach.

1167
00:40:44.52 --> 00:40:47.36
We're PT. And we're looking in towards the compound.

1168
00:40:47.36 --> 00:40:49.40
So the oceans that are back.

1169
00:40:49.40 --> 00:40:54.36
And the instructor, he's looking out to sea.

1170
00:40:54.36 --> 00:40:56.12
And we're exercising.

1171
00:40:56.12 --> 00:40:58.84
And it starts to rain, which is bad.

1172
00:40:58.84 --> 00:41:00.20
But you'll get through it.

1173
00:41:00.20 --> 00:41:02.40
And then it starts to lightning and hail.

1174
00:41:02.40 --> 00:41:03.72
It's like storm.

1175
00:41:03.72 --> 00:41:05.52
The rare, rare accursion for San Diego.

1176
00:41:05.52 --> 00:41:06.40
Exactly.

1177
00:41:06.40 --> 00:41:10.20
So working on that tugboat, moving ammunition,

1178
00:41:10.20 --> 00:41:11.60
when it's their hero.

1179
00:41:11.60 --> 00:41:12.60
I can't remember.

1180
00:41:12.60 --> 00:41:13.72
Oh yeah, hero condition.

1181
00:41:13.72 --> 00:41:14.36
Hero condition.

1182
00:41:14.36 --> 00:41:14.88
Right.

1183
00:41:14.88 --> 00:41:16.80
That's when there's electric stuff there.

1184
00:41:16.80 --> 00:41:17.56
You've got to stop.

1185
00:41:17.56 --> 00:41:18.44
Things will blow up.

1186
00:41:18.44 --> 00:41:21.88
And so I'm thinking, wow, this is bad.

1187
00:41:21.88 --> 00:41:22.92
We're standing on the beach.

1188
00:41:22.92 --> 00:41:25.84
The only thing we don't have is a golf club holding up there.

1189
00:41:25.84 --> 00:41:29.52
And the instructor, he goes and halt in buds.

1190
00:41:29.52 --> 00:41:31.24
That's not like smoking me if you got him.

1191
00:41:31.24 --> 00:41:32.68
You're standing at rigid attention.

1192
00:41:32.68 --> 00:41:33.76
He runs into the compound.

1193
00:41:33.76 --> 00:41:34.68
I'm like, well, good.

1194
00:41:34.68 --> 00:41:36.44
We're going to get us off this beach.

1195
00:41:36.44 --> 00:41:37.52
We've got to get out of here.

1196
00:41:37.52 --> 00:41:38.92
It's a lightning storm.

1197
00:41:38.92 --> 00:41:41.24
And he comes running back out.

1198
00:41:41.24 --> 00:41:44.16
And he has a dive mask on.

1199
00:41:44.16 --> 00:41:47.72
And I'm like, oh, I get it.

1200
00:41:47.72 --> 00:41:50.04
This is the contract.

1201
00:41:50.04 --> 00:41:53.000
So my part of the contract was I'm

1202
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.64
going to show up here every single day

1203
00:41:55.64 --> 00:41:59.80
and do everything I possibly can to meet your standard.

1204
00:41:59.80 --> 00:42:01.32
My instructor is not my standard.

1205
00:42:01.32 --> 00:42:02.72
Your standard.

1206
00:42:02.72 --> 00:42:05.12
And his part of the contract was he's

1207
00:42:05.12 --> 00:42:07.48
going to show up every single day and make sure

1208
00:42:07.48 --> 00:42:10.28
that I adhere to his standard.

1209
00:42:10.28 --> 00:42:12.40
And it was like a light bulb appeared above my head.

1210
00:42:12.40 --> 00:42:15.000
So it's just raining so hard that he needed a dive mask.

1211
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.68
Because he couldn't see if we were performing the functions

1212
00:42:17.68 --> 00:42:18.56
to his standard.

1213
00:42:18.56 --> 00:42:20.32
Check.

1214
00:42:20.32 --> 00:42:22.36
So that was it.

1215
00:42:22.36 --> 00:42:24.60
I'm like, I get buds at this point.

1216
00:42:24.60 --> 00:42:26.72
Well, how deep were you in the buds a couple weeks?

1217
00:42:26.72 --> 00:42:28.44
That was PTRR.

1218
00:42:28.44 --> 00:42:32.08
Oh, so you weren't even classed up yet.

1219
00:42:32.08 --> 00:42:35.92
So when I started, there was guys with like sandbag.

1220
00:42:35.92 --> 00:42:39.44
So they're like, you have to do the O-Chorus.

1221
00:42:39.44 --> 00:42:41.72
And I'm just making up these numbers now in 10 minutes.

1222
00:42:41.72 --> 00:42:43.000
And then they had to be 930.

1223
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.56
And you had this progression, right?

1224
00:42:45.56 --> 00:42:49.16
So they would do it just passing on purpose.

1225
00:42:49.16 --> 00:42:51.56
Because I knew there were better athletes in me.

1226
00:42:51.56 --> 00:42:53.04
And I took the opposite approach.

1227
00:42:53.04 --> 00:42:54.68
I was like, I'm going to get up every single day

1228
00:42:54.68 --> 00:42:57.32
and try as hard as I can for everything I do.

1229
00:42:57.32 --> 00:42:59.04
Like every single thing I do.

1230
00:42:59.04 --> 00:43:01.04
And then I'm going to get better.

1231
00:43:01.04 --> 00:43:06.04
I'm not going to stay the same or decrease.

1232
00:43:06.04 --> 00:43:07.76
I will get better.

1233
00:43:07.76 --> 00:43:09.60
And I know I can do this because there's somebody

1234
00:43:09.60 --> 00:43:12.16
who tried it making me do it.

1235
00:43:12.16 --> 00:43:13.72
So it's possible.

1236
00:43:13.72 --> 00:43:15.20
And so I did that.

1237
00:43:15.20 --> 00:43:16.20
That's how I got through the buds.

1238
00:43:16.20 --> 00:43:18.32
And I swear, man, third phase out at the island,

1239
00:43:18.32 --> 00:43:19.68
we're flying back.

1240
00:43:19.68 --> 00:43:23.12
And I was certain that plane was going to crash.

1241
00:43:23.12 --> 00:43:25.32
Because there was no way I could be graduating from Buds.

1242
00:43:25.32 --> 00:43:26.88
You know what I mean?

1243
00:43:26.88 --> 00:43:30.24
What was the, what do you remember about like Hell Week?

1244
00:43:30.24 --> 00:43:32.48
Was Hell Week a challenge for you?

1245
00:43:32.48 --> 00:43:33.84
It was, but I was a booker leader.

1246
00:43:33.84 --> 00:43:34.68
Because I was an E4.

1247
00:43:34.68 --> 00:43:35.68
Oh, you were an E4.

1248
00:43:35.68 --> 00:43:36.28
I was an E4.

1249
00:43:36.28 --> 00:43:37.64
Wheel of some heat, dude.

1250
00:43:37.64 --> 00:43:41.24
And I've found, yeah.

1251
00:43:41.24 --> 00:43:43.88
I have found personally that when you are in a leadership

1252
00:43:43.88 --> 00:43:46.08
position and you have people that you need to be concerned

1253
00:43:46.08 --> 00:43:49.28
about, then you're putting their care above your own,

1254
00:43:49.28 --> 00:43:50.48
which I've done my whole life.

1255
00:43:50.48 --> 00:43:53.20
So that was just something that you do.

1256
00:43:53.20 --> 00:43:57.20
That it actually makes the time go by better.

1257
00:43:57.20 --> 00:43:59.44
Because you're not worried about yourself.

1258
00:43:59.44 --> 00:44:01.56
You're not focusing internally.

1259
00:44:01.56 --> 00:44:02.08
This is hard.

1260
00:44:02.08 --> 00:44:02.68
I'm freezing.

1261
00:44:02.68 --> 00:44:04.48
And I'm chafed or whatever.

1262
00:44:04.48 --> 00:44:06.16
You're looking out for your men.

1263
00:44:06.16 --> 00:44:07.52
And you get this.

1264
00:44:07.52 --> 00:44:11.76
But you're like, this person is having a bad time.

1265
00:44:11.76 --> 00:44:16.88
And what can I do from my position to make this better

1266
00:44:16.88 --> 00:44:20.44
for them so that we can accomplish the mission?

1267
00:44:20.44 --> 00:44:24.000
And if someone couldn't make it in Buds, people are like, oh,

1268
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.72
you should help them and carry them along.

1269
00:44:25.72 --> 00:44:27.68
I took, again, the opposite approach.

1270
00:44:27.68 --> 00:44:30.72
If this person can't get through Buds and we're going to

1271
00:44:30.72 --> 00:44:33.08
carry him through Buds, what are they going to be like when

1272
00:44:33.08 --> 00:44:35.08
they get to the skill teams?

1273
00:44:35.08 --> 00:44:37.76
So you can take that to an extreme.

1274
00:44:37.76 --> 00:44:40.08
If somebody was having a bad day, you help them out.

1275
00:44:40.08 --> 00:44:45.04
But if someone was consistently performing below par, I don't

1276
00:44:45.04 --> 00:44:47.04
want them around.

1277
00:44:47.04 --> 00:44:52.28
So for me, Hell Week was very challenging.

1278
00:44:52.28 --> 00:44:54.84
But at the same time, I think it was easier for me than any

1279
00:44:54.84 --> 00:44:56.08
of the guys on my boat crew.

1280
00:44:56.08 --> 00:45:01.12
Because they were more focused on them getting through this.

1281
00:45:01.12 --> 00:45:04.88
And I was more focused on getting us through it.

1282
00:45:04.88 --> 00:45:07.12
I liked Hell Week because there's nothing I could fail.

1283
00:45:07.12 --> 00:45:08.68
Like everything else.

1284
00:45:08.68 --> 00:45:09.96
Because I wasn't good at anything.

1285
00:45:09.96 --> 00:45:11.08
I wasn't good at running.

1286
00:45:11.08 --> 00:45:11.84
I wasn't good at swimming.

1287
00:45:11.84 --> 00:45:12.96
I wasn't good at the O-Course.

1288
00:45:12.96 --> 00:45:14.92
I wasn't going to tell everybody that.

1289
00:45:14.92 --> 00:45:17.80
I was always like, I could fail this swim.

1290
00:45:17.80 --> 00:45:18.56
I could fail this run.

1291
00:45:18.56 --> 00:45:20.56
I had to just put out so hard.

1292
00:45:20.56 --> 00:45:22.32
But Hell Week was like, oh, we just got to finish?

1293
00:45:22.32 --> 00:45:23.52
Bro, I could do that.

1294
00:45:23.52 --> 00:45:24.56
Just not quit?

1295
00:45:24.56 --> 00:45:26.24
That's my game.

1296
00:45:26.24 --> 00:45:27.16
Want to play that game?

1297
00:45:27.16 --> 00:45:27.88
That's my game.

1298
00:45:27.88 --> 00:45:29.56
No sleep and no quitting?

1299
00:45:29.56 --> 00:45:30.64
That's my game.

1300
00:45:30.64 --> 00:45:34.08
If there was a pro sport, I'd be doing good at that sport.

1301
00:45:34.08 --> 00:45:35.32
So Hell Week for me was fun.

1302
00:45:35.32 --> 00:45:36.24
What about the water?

1303
00:45:36.24 --> 00:45:37.80
Was the water all good for you?

1304
00:45:37.80 --> 00:45:39.20
Pool, comp, and all that stuff?

1305
00:45:39.20 --> 00:45:42.56
Yeah, so I failed pool comp the first time.

1306
00:45:42.56 --> 00:45:43.44
Me too.

1307
00:45:43.44 --> 00:45:45.64
Do you know why I failed pool comp the first time?

1308
00:45:45.64 --> 00:45:47.72
Because I forgot the end of the brief.

1309
00:45:47.72 --> 00:45:49.20
What was the end of the brief?

1310
00:45:49.20 --> 00:45:51.24
Kiss the regulator and ascend.

1311
00:45:51.24 --> 00:45:52.000
What you did just ascend?

1312
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.48
I sat there.

1313
00:45:54.48 --> 00:45:56.08
So I did the whole everything.

1314
00:45:56.08 --> 00:45:57.48
And I just forgot the end of the brief.

1315
00:45:57.48 --> 00:45:58.80
Kiss the regulator and ascend.

1316
00:45:58.80 --> 00:46:01.56
And McCarthy was my instructor.

1317
00:46:01.56 --> 00:46:02.08
Did you see him around?

1318
00:46:02.08 --> 00:46:02.56
Oh, yeah.

1319
00:46:02.56 --> 00:46:05.16
Yeah, he'd, brrr, and he pulls me out of the pool.

1320
00:46:05.16 --> 00:46:06.36
He's like, what is wrong with you?

1321
00:46:06.36 --> 00:46:08.44
And I go, what do you mean, Secretary McCarthy?

1322
00:46:08.44 --> 00:46:12.04
He goes, dude, if you had just kissed the regulator

1323
00:46:12.04 --> 00:46:13.56
and ascended, you'd be fine.

1324
00:46:13.56 --> 00:46:14.92
And I was like, oh, check, Raj.

1325
00:46:14.92 --> 00:46:17.12
That's the end of the brief.

1326
00:46:17.12 --> 00:46:18.24
So no, the water workers fine.

1327
00:46:18.24 --> 00:46:20.60
I might have to struggle swims.

1328
00:46:20.60 --> 00:46:21.28
But um.

1329
00:46:21.28 --> 00:46:22.56
Like passing swims?

1330
00:46:22.56 --> 00:46:24.36
You're a slow swimmer?

1331
00:46:24.36 --> 00:46:25.92
Dude, a nine-year-old taught me how

1332
00:46:25.92 --> 00:46:29.64
to do the side stroke like two weeks before I went to Butts.

1333
00:46:29.64 --> 00:46:33.60
So in fact, yes, I was a slow swimmer.

1334
00:46:33.60 --> 00:46:35.48
It was actually about three months before I went to Butts,

1335
00:46:35.48 --> 00:46:38.68
because in that interim period from core school,

1336
00:46:38.68 --> 00:46:40.88
to going to Butts, I worked at the Naval Hospital.

1337
00:46:40.88 --> 00:46:43.12
And I collected dirty linen.

1338
00:46:43.12 --> 00:46:43.80
Awesome.

1339
00:46:43.80 --> 00:46:48.000
But I also, so the linen collection shop at Balboa

1340
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.92
and Naval Hospital, I don't know if it's still there,

1341
00:46:49.92 --> 00:46:52.80
was down in the basement right next to the morgue.

1342
00:46:52.80 --> 00:46:54.76
And I was like, I'm going to go to Butts training.

1343
00:46:54.76 --> 00:46:58.68
And I should understand more about human physiology,

1344
00:46:58.68 --> 00:47:00.16
because I'm going there.

1345
00:47:00.16 --> 00:47:03.24
And so I would go do, it's like Wednesday morning,

1346
00:47:03.24 --> 00:47:05.48
he's got a name Braswell.

1347
00:47:05.48 --> 00:47:07.08
He was the autopsy instructor.

1348
00:47:07.08 --> 00:47:10.60
So I would go do these autopsies.

1349
00:47:10.60 --> 00:47:11.60
You know, I would stand there.

1350
00:47:11.60 --> 00:47:14.28
I finally worked my way up to weighing organs.

1351
00:47:14.28 --> 00:47:16.76
But just to really truly understand physiology.

1352
00:47:16.76 --> 00:47:18.84
Because you read that in a book, and you

1353
00:47:18.84 --> 00:47:20.84
can do a cadaver lab and that sort of stuff.

1354
00:47:20.84 --> 00:47:25.04
But when you have something that is newly deceased,

1355
00:47:25.04 --> 00:47:27.20
you have a much better understanding of how things truly

1356
00:47:27.20 --> 00:47:28.44
work in your body.

1357
00:47:28.44 --> 00:47:30.56
It was a fascinating experience, actually.

1358
00:47:30.56 --> 00:47:32.76
That was an interesting little off-ramp.

1359
00:47:32.76 --> 00:47:34.68
We just took into the morgue.

1360
00:47:34.68 --> 00:47:37.32
Well, I mean, so I was a corpsman.

1361
00:47:37.32 --> 00:47:40.44
And then I went to the 300F1 program down in San Antonio,

1362
00:47:40.44 --> 00:47:42.92
Texas after I graduated from Butts.

1363
00:47:42.92 --> 00:47:47.40
And then I went, finally, after two platoons at Team 4

1364
00:47:47.40 --> 00:47:50.72
in South and Central America and then Bosnia-Hurts, Govenia,

1365
00:47:50.72 --> 00:47:52.80
I finished the 18 Delta Course, of which

1366
00:47:52.80 --> 00:47:54.80
I was the distinguished undergraduate of my class.

1367
00:47:54.80 --> 00:47:55.48
In case you want to go.

1368
00:47:55.48 --> 00:47:55.88
Boom.

1369
00:47:55.88 --> 00:47:56.80
You know why?

1370
00:47:56.80 --> 00:47:59.000
Because I didn't want to go.

1371
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.08
Because I was a frogman.

1372
00:48:00.08 --> 00:48:03.20
And I want to take six months off to go work with the Army,

1373
00:48:03.20 --> 00:48:04.32
going to school anywhere.

1374
00:48:04.32 --> 00:48:05.52
I want to stay in a platoon.

1375
00:48:05.52 --> 00:48:06.20
That was my thing.

1376
00:48:06.20 --> 00:48:08.20
If you're a seal, you should be in a platoon.

1377
00:48:08.20 --> 00:48:10.60
And if you're in a platoon, you should be at war.

1378
00:48:10.60 --> 00:48:11.96
That's it.

1379
00:48:11.96 --> 00:48:13.16
And God bless them.

1380
00:48:13.16 --> 00:48:16.88
The guys who do 27 years at trade ed and mar ops instructors.

1381
00:48:16.88 --> 00:48:17.80
Thanks.

1382
00:48:17.80 --> 00:48:18.48
That's so known.

1383
00:48:18.48 --> 00:48:19.36
I also have to do that.

1384
00:48:19.36 --> 00:48:20.48
But you get the deal.

1385
00:48:20.48 --> 00:48:22.44
The SEALS natural environment is combat.

1386
00:48:22.44 --> 00:48:23.32
Cut, try, period.

1387
00:48:23.32 --> 00:48:25.08
Over.

1388
00:48:25.08 --> 00:48:27.56
But yeah, so I didn't want to go.

1389
00:48:27.56 --> 00:48:29.64
And I'm like, Army, Special Forces guys.

1390
00:48:29.64 --> 00:48:31.16
I have so many SF friends.

1391
00:48:31.16 --> 00:48:32.52
They're good dudes.

1392
00:48:32.52 --> 00:48:34.64
I'm like, how do I beat them?

1393
00:48:34.64 --> 00:48:36.68
Academically.

1394
00:48:36.68 --> 00:48:39.52
So they're very serious about academics.

1395
00:48:39.52 --> 00:48:41.08
That course was really hard.

1396
00:48:41.08 --> 00:48:41.88
That was a hard course.

1397
00:48:41.88 --> 00:48:42.68
I didn't go through it.

1398
00:48:42.68 --> 00:48:44.64
But I remember, you would kick guys' asses.

1399
00:48:44.64 --> 00:48:47.68
So when I graduated, the commander

1400
00:48:47.68 --> 00:48:50.16
had to give me their commander's excellence going.

1401
00:48:50.16 --> 00:48:50.92
You loved that.

1402
00:48:50.92 --> 00:48:52.36
It was just like their hand is shaking.

1403
00:48:52.36 --> 00:48:54.60
Like, argh.

1404
00:48:54.60 --> 00:48:57.08
So and it was just very, very interesting.

1405
00:48:57.08 --> 00:48:59.60
And if you're going to do your job, do it the best you can.

1406
00:48:59.60 --> 00:49:01.80
And that's just, I mean, everyone should

1407
00:49:01.80 --> 00:49:03.56
take that approach of life.

1408
00:49:03.56 --> 00:49:08.84
Have you ever seen this documentary called Hero Love Sushi?

1409
00:49:08.84 --> 00:49:09.60
I have not seen it.

1410
00:49:09.60 --> 00:49:10.76
But I know about it.

1411
00:49:10.76 --> 00:49:11.72
It's fascinating.

1412
00:49:11.72 --> 00:49:12.76
I started watching it, bro.

1413
00:49:12.76 --> 00:49:14.56
And honestly, it didn't really grab me.

1414
00:49:14.56 --> 00:49:17.24
And I don't have a bunch of time to be watching movies that

1415
00:49:17.24 --> 00:49:18.60
aren't getting me out of the gate.

1416
00:49:18.60 --> 00:49:19.56
And it just didn't do it.

1417
00:49:19.56 --> 00:49:21.36
I'll get to it at some point.

1418
00:49:21.36 --> 00:49:24.40
I think when I'm older, like maybe 65, 70,

1419
00:49:24.40 --> 00:49:25.44
I'm going to roll into that.

1420
00:49:25.44 --> 00:49:26.36
Because I've heard it's great.

1421
00:49:26.36 --> 00:49:27.96
And I think I was totally focused.

1422
00:49:27.96 --> 00:49:31.68
And he has the most popular sushi place in the world.

1423
00:49:31.68 --> 00:49:33.36
And there's the hard to get to.

1424
00:49:33.36 --> 00:49:35.56
And it's this little shack on the side of the road

1425
00:49:35.56 --> 00:49:37.12
or whatever, a really small thing.

1426
00:49:37.12 --> 00:49:38.08
And he's the best in the world.

1427
00:49:38.08 --> 00:49:39.76
What I got out of all of that is that you

1428
00:49:39.76 --> 00:49:41.48
have the attention span of a net.

1429
00:49:41.48 --> 00:49:42.36
I may.

1430
00:49:42.36 --> 00:49:43.92
I may.

1431
00:49:43.92 --> 00:49:47.80
So this guy's talking about, you don't have

1432
00:49:47.80 --> 00:49:49.48
to be proud of your job.

1433
00:49:49.48 --> 00:49:51.56
But you have to be proud of your work.

1434
00:49:51.56 --> 00:49:52.36
Interesting.

1435
00:49:52.36 --> 00:49:53.76
That's the whole crux of that movie.

1436
00:49:53.76 --> 00:49:55.28
That's why it's so fascinating.

1437
00:49:55.28 --> 00:49:57.28
And you've got to get to that.

1438
00:49:57.28 --> 00:49:58.24
So you can be doing anything.

1439
00:49:58.24 --> 00:49:59.76
Just do it the best you can.

1440
00:49:59.76 --> 00:50:00.48
That's 100%.

1441
00:50:00.48 --> 00:50:01.72
And by the way, that's the way.

1442
00:50:01.72 --> 00:50:04.60
If you don't like your job, the way out of your job

1443
00:50:04.60 --> 00:50:08.08
is to do the job to the absolute best of your ability.

1444
00:50:08.08 --> 00:50:10.76
The way to stay in your shitty job that you don't like

1445
00:50:10.76 --> 00:50:12.44
is to not perform well at it.

1446
00:50:12.44 --> 00:50:14.08
And it's not going to work out well for you

1447
00:50:14.08 --> 00:50:14.88
to stay in that job.

1448
00:50:14.88 --> 00:50:17.000
Or you're going to get an even worse job.

1449
00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.88
So you're flying back from San Clementi Island,

1450
00:50:18.88 --> 00:50:21.12
which means you're graduating from Buds.

1451
00:50:21.12 --> 00:50:22.64
And you get stationed.

1452
00:50:22.64 --> 00:50:23.40
Where do you get?

1453
00:50:23.40 --> 00:50:24.000
Silt team four.

1454
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.20
Did you pick East Coast?

1455
00:50:25.20 --> 00:50:26.56
I picked Silt team four.

1456
00:50:26.56 --> 00:50:28.16
And this is why.

1457
00:50:28.16 --> 00:50:31.08
Because Silt team four was the only Silt team

1458
00:50:31.08 --> 00:50:34.48
I was aware of that had been in combat since the Vietnam War.

1459
00:50:34.48 --> 00:50:36.28
And just like we just talked about, man,

1460
00:50:36.28 --> 00:50:39.000
a Silt's natural environment is combat.

1461
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.48
So I put that as my first choice.

1462
00:50:42.48 --> 00:50:44.96
Because I thought that was the team that

1463
00:50:44.96 --> 00:50:48.96
has the highest probability of entering into combat.

1464
00:50:48.96 --> 00:50:51.80
That was in Panama.

1465
00:50:51.80 --> 00:50:54.32
That was Panama was 1989.

1466
00:50:54.32 --> 00:50:57.04
So now it's 1991.

1467
00:50:57.04 --> 00:50:59.48
October 23, 1992, I graduated from Buds.

1468
00:50:59.48 --> 00:51:01.60
So it was in 93-ish or whatever.

1469
00:51:01.60 --> 00:51:06.24
So at the time, that was it, man.

1470
00:51:06.24 --> 00:51:07.28
And these guys.

1471
00:51:07.28 --> 00:51:08.28
Yeah.

1472
00:51:08.28 --> 00:51:09.12
And at the time.

1473
00:51:09.12 --> 00:51:10.32
Our products operations and all that stuff.

1474
00:51:10.32 --> 00:51:11.32
Yeah.

1475
00:51:11.32 --> 00:51:14.60
At the time, the Silt teams were geographically oriented.

1476
00:51:14.60 --> 00:51:16.64
And so that meant that different teams

1477
00:51:16.64 --> 00:51:18.60
had different geography that they covered.

1478
00:51:18.60 --> 00:51:22.48
And Silt team four at the time covered Central and South

1479
00:51:22.48 --> 00:51:23.28
America.

1480
00:51:23.28 --> 00:51:26.56
Which means every Spanish speaking person in the Silt

1481
00:51:26.56 --> 00:51:28.60
teams went there immediately.

1482
00:51:28.60 --> 00:51:32.08
And there was things going on down there.

1483
00:51:32.08 --> 00:51:34.48
There was the counter drug stuff.

1484
00:51:34.48 --> 00:51:35.96
There was revolutions going on.

1485
00:51:35.96 --> 00:51:39.08
So that sounded like a good place for you,

1486
00:51:39.08 --> 00:51:40.24
the way you looked at it.

1487
00:51:40.24 --> 00:51:41.12
That's where you wanted to go.

1488
00:51:41.12 --> 00:51:41.48
Yeah.

1489
00:51:41.48 --> 00:51:42.36
And I tell you what.

1490
00:51:42.36 --> 00:51:43.12
You were smart of me.

1491
00:51:43.12 --> 00:51:44.40
You know, I wanted to go to Silt team one

1492
00:51:44.40 --> 00:51:47.56
because I thought we were going to NAM.

1493
00:51:47.56 --> 00:51:50.20
I was like, bro, team one, Vietnam.

1494
00:51:50.20 --> 00:51:52.12
There's got to be stuff going on.

1495
00:51:52.12 --> 00:51:54.40
You know, I went to Vietnam in 1998.

1496
00:51:54.40 --> 00:51:55.08
That's awesome.

1497
00:51:55.08 --> 00:51:56.44
On the recovery missions.

1498
00:51:56.44 --> 00:51:57.44
During task force full time.

1499
00:51:57.44 --> 00:51:59.16
Yeah.

1500
00:51:59.16 --> 00:51:59.60
Yeah, man.

1501
00:51:59.60 --> 00:52:00.60
So I went to team four.

1502
00:52:00.60 --> 00:52:02.04
I did two platoons there.

1503
00:52:02.04 --> 00:52:03.80
How was it when you showed up at team four?

1504
00:52:03.80 --> 00:52:04.72
Because that's the other thing.

1505
00:52:04.72 --> 00:52:05.68
At team four.

1506
00:52:05.68 --> 00:52:08.12
And that was a guy had a bunch of friends that went to team four.

1507
00:52:08.12 --> 00:52:10.24
And team four was like an awesome team at that time.

1508
00:52:10.24 --> 00:52:10.76
Yeah.

1509
00:52:10.76 --> 00:52:16.88
Team four was the East Coast equivalent of team five.

1510
00:52:16.88 --> 00:52:20.48
Much more relaxed and but super, super professional.

1511
00:52:20.48 --> 00:52:24.88
So you would do, I think, six weeks of land warfare at Pickett.

1512
00:52:24.88 --> 00:52:27.44
And then you'd go down to Panama and you spent your first month

1513
00:52:27.44 --> 00:52:29.68
and a half living in the jungle.

1514
00:52:29.68 --> 00:52:31.36
I actually did that trip from team one.

1515
00:52:31.36 --> 00:52:31.84
Did you really?

1516
00:52:31.84 --> 00:52:32.36
Yep.

1517
00:52:32.36 --> 00:52:35.84
We went down there and did 34 days or something out in the J.

1518
00:52:35.84 --> 00:52:36.08
Right.

1519
00:52:36.08 --> 00:52:38.64
So you seriously knew what you're doing.

1520
00:52:38.64 --> 00:52:41.52
And I really appreciated that a lot.

1521
00:52:41.52 --> 00:52:45.48
And that's why I volunteered to go to TrayDead

1522
00:52:45.48 --> 00:52:48.44
because I was not satisfied with our land warfare training.

1523
00:52:48.44 --> 00:52:51.56
I thought it was completely inadequate.

1524
00:52:51.56 --> 00:52:53.20
Coming from that background at team four.

1525
00:52:53.20 --> 00:52:54.36
So I did those two platoons.

1526
00:52:54.36 --> 00:52:56.60
And then here's your job.

1527
00:52:56.60 --> 00:52:57.72
Cormand and intelligence.

1528
00:52:57.72 --> 00:52:58.24
Oh, that's right.

1529
00:52:58.24 --> 00:52:59.08
You were a medic.

1530
00:52:59.08 --> 00:53:00.68
Medic and intel.

1531
00:53:00.68 --> 00:53:04.04
So I did eight platoons as a Cormand and a medic.

1532
00:53:04.04 --> 00:53:05.56
And I mean, you don't really do that anymore

1533
00:53:05.56 --> 00:53:06.48
once you become a chief.

1534
00:53:06.48 --> 00:53:08.20
But it was still my specialty.

1535
00:53:08.20 --> 00:53:09.36
My forte.

1536
00:53:09.36 --> 00:53:11.44
And how were those deployments?

1537
00:53:11.44 --> 00:53:13.04
They were very interesting.

1538
00:53:13.04 --> 00:53:15.52
I mean, I got my first.

1539
00:53:15.52 --> 00:53:16.64
So this is like 94.

1540
00:53:16.64 --> 00:53:18.04
You're going on your first deployment?

1541
00:53:18.04 --> 00:53:19.16
94, 95.

1542
00:53:19.16 --> 00:53:20.84
94, 95 deployment.

1543
00:53:20.84 --> 00:53:25.12
I got my first Navy achievement medal when I was in STT

1544
00:53:25.12 --> 00:53:27.48
at the time, which was interesting.

1545
00:53:27.48 --> 00:53:30.72
I told you, because I got my second down on my first deployment.

1546
00:53:30.72 --> 00:53:33.32
The first one was because some guy got shot at a basketball

1547
00:53:33.32 --> 00:53:35.12
outside of a grocery store in Virginia

1548
00:53:35.12 --> 00:53:38.44
and went and saved his life, as you do.

1549
00:53:38.44 --> 00:53:42.08
And then there was another terrific accident.

1550
00:53:42.08 --> 00:53:43.000
So I was a new guy.

1551
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.72
But I'm like, I stick to my guns.

1552
00:53:45.72 --> 00:53:49.28
And I paid the man for it several times.

1553
00:53:49.28 --> 00:53:52.48
But I would insist on bringing my medical gear back to it.

1554
00:53:52.48 --> 00:53:57.60
We were staying in four different condos in Salinas, Ecuador.

1555
00:53:57.60 --> 00:54:00.04
And I would insist of packing up all of my medical gear

1556
00:54:00.04 --> 00:54:03.56
and taking them back to my room every night after training.

1557
00:54:03.56 --> 00:54:05.16
And like, new guy, we want to go there.

1558
00:54:05.16 --> 00:54:07.48
I'm like, I don't care.

1559
00:54:07.48 --> 00:54:10.28
Tune me up if you want, but I'm going to have my stuff.

1560
00:54:10.28 --> 00:54:12.60
Like 2 o'clock in the morning, big thing.

1561
00:54:12.60 --> 00:54:17.20
This car was driving, and they lost control

1562
00:54:17.20 --> 00:54:20.04
and hit a cement telephone pole.

1563
00:54:20.04 --> 00:54:22.28
They just split the car in half and shot bodies

1564
00:54:22.28 --> 00:54:24.24
all over the street.

1565
00:54:24.24 --> 00:54:27.08
So I was like, holy beanbags.

1566
00:54:27.08 --> 00:54:32.80
And I had all my stuff and made the Naval base.

1567
00:54:32.80 --> 00:54:35.52
This is written in the soul, Navy Tune Metal.

1568
00:54:35.52 --> 00:54:39.04
And made the Navy base reopen their clinic

1569
00:54:39.04 --> 00:54:40.84
and had all my stuff and all the guys.

1570
00:54:40.84 --> 00:54:41.40
My god.

1571
00:54:41.40 --> 00:54:44.28
But I miss sometimes being around SEALs

1572
00:54:44.28 --> 00:54:45.72
because they just perform.

1573
00:54:45.72 --> 00:54:46.52
You're like, bam.

1574
00:54:46.52 --> 00:54:47.92
They can be sitting around doing something.

1575
00:54:47.92 --> 00:54:49.04
They are on it.

1576
00:54:49.04 --> 00:54:52.40
So everybody has that nascent medical training,

1577
00:54:52.40 --> 00:54:53.56
and they all just perform.

1578
00:54:53.56 --> 00:54:55.40
I'm like, this, this, this, God, check.

1579
00:54:55.40 --> 00:54:56.56
We saved everybody's lives.

1580
00:54:58.92 --> 00:55:02.76
So that was part of the reason that this deployment was so

1581
00:55:02.76 --> 00:55:04.36
terribly interesting.

1582
00:55:04.36 --> 00:55:08.32
And then 96 rolls around.

1583
00:55:08.32 --> 00:55:10.20
95, 96 rolls around.

1584
00:55:10.20 --> 00:55:15.16
And the war was going on in Bosnia-Hurtskivina.

1585
00:55:15.16 --> 00:55:16.56
So is this now your second platoon?

1586
00:55:16.56 --> 00:55:19.12
This would be my, this wasn't even a platoon.

1587
00:55:19.12 --> 00:55:20.84
I had done two platoons.

1588
00:55:20.84 --> 00:55:22.56
And this was like kind of an augment thing.

1589
00:55:22.56 --> 00:55:23.40
It was really great.

1590
00:55:23.40 --> 00:55:27.64
So they're trying to figure out a way

1591
00:55:27.64 --> 00:55:30.52
to implement the Dayton Accords that were signed in 1995

1592
00:55:30.52 --> 00:55:33.56
after Storm 95, which is a Croatian offensive that

1593
00:55:33.56 --> 00:55:35.08
kept the Serbs back.

1594
00:55:35.08 --> 00:55:37.08
So they signed this Dayton Accords,

1595
00:55:37.08 --> 00:55:38.92
and they're trying to figure out how to implement them.

1596
00:55:38.92 --> 00:55:41.28
Prior to that, there was a program called the Joint

1597
00:55:41.28 --> 00:55:43.56
Commission Observers, and those were tier one guys that

1598
00:55:43.56 --> 00:55:48.24
were going in and doing JTAC stuff and whatever.

1599
00:55:48.24 --> 00:55:51.52
And so this transitions to how are we going to maintain this

1600
00:55:51.52 --> 00:55:52.44
presence on the ground.

1601
00:55:52.44 --> 00:55:55.24
So they transitioned from the tier one guys to the theater

1602
00:55:55.24 --> 00:55:58.76
soft, and SF had this mission.

1603
00:55:58.76 --> 00:56:00.64
And they wouldn't let us do it.

1604
00:56:00.64 --> 00:56:02.76
Were you around for, what were you doing?

1605
00:56:02.76 --> 00:56:04.92
So what year is this?

1606
00:56:04.92 --> 00:56:05.68
96.

1607
00:56:05.68 --> 00:56:08.04
96, I was in training, because I was at SEAL Team 1.

1608
00:56:08.04 --> 00:56:08.68
OK.

1609
00:56:08.68 --> 00:56:09.88
So you remember the JCO stuff?

1610
00:56:09.88 --> 00:56:11.20
Were guys going to go to Bosnia?

1611
00:56:11.20 --> 00:56:14.72
So they come back on the grind or Team 4,

1612
00:56:14.72 --> 00:56:16.80
which is just part of a compound.

1613
00:56:16.80 --> 00:56:18.24
I'm on the East Coast.

1614
00:56:18.24 --> 00:56:22.04
And they're like, OK, SF can't man this mission.

1615
00:56:22.04 --> 00:56:23.24
We're going to let SEALs do it.

1616
00:56:23.24 --> 00:56:26.000
So everyone was like, yeah, we're going to war.

1617
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.12
Excited, right?

1618
00:56:27.12 --> 00:56:29.08
And they go, we're taking E7 in the bus.

1619
00:56:29.08 --> 00:56:29.96
No, ha!

1620
00:56:29.96 --> 00:56:32.04
And I'm like, I'm going to E5.

1621
00:56:32.04 --> 00:56:34.000
So I'm like, come on, man.

1622
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.72
So everybody goes to the language lab, signs up.

1623
00:56:36.72 --> 00:56:38.52
This is something that I learned.

1624
00:56:38.52 --> 00:56:41.24
And I think I'm not sure.

1625
00:56:41.24 --> 00:56:42.36
I hope that I'm wrong.

1626
00:56:42.36 --> 00:56:46.84
But I see the military going back to the way it was in the 90s.

1627
00:56:46.84 --> 00:56:48.52
Politically and all this stuff, right?

1628
00:56:48.52 --> 00:56:50.96
I mean, I do believe we are auguring in.

1629
00:56:50.96 --> 00:56:53.32
The Department of Defense is broken right now.

1630
00:56:53.32 --> 00:56:57.32
So everybody goes and signs up on this legal pact.

1631
00:56:57.32 --> 00:57:01.84
And then they call them in, rank, one, the next, next,

1632
00:57:01.84 --> 00:57:02.44
next, next.

1633
00:57:02.44 --> 00:57:05.000
And everyone's like, well, actually, I got to mow my lawn.

1634
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.28
Well, my daughter's in soccer.

1635
00:57:06.28 --> 00:57:09.80
Well, they worked their way down.

1636
00:57:09.80 --> 00:57:11.88
They get down to E5 Derek.

1637
00:57:11.88 --> 00:57:15.08
So some of the guys that signed up weren't really wanting to go.

1638
00:57:15.08 --> 00:57:19.08
You understand this concept when you're standing in a group

1639
00:57:19.08 --> 00:57:21.08
and you need to be like, oh, going to war?

1640
00:57:21.08 --> 00:57:22.000
Yeah, I'm a seal.

1641
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:22.40
That's great.

1642
00:57:22.40 --> 00:57:23.96
And they get really excited about it.

1643
00:57:23.96 --> 00:57:26.04
But then when you get them on one-on-one,

1644
00:57:26.04 --> 00:57:27.36
they don't want to be there.

1645
00:57:27.36 --> 00:57:27.84
You know what I mean?

1646
00:57:27.84 --> 00:57:29.72
They join the canoe club.

1647
00:57:29.72 --> 00:57:32.12
They want to work out and all that stuff.

1648
00:57:32.12 --> 00:57:34.08
That transcends all spectrum.

1649
00:57:34.08 --> 00:57:35.96
That's not unique to seals.

1650
00:57:35.96 --> 00:57:38.000
So they get down to me.

1651
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.68
And that's freaking crazy, dude.

1652
00:57:39.68 --> 00:57:40.96
Right.

1653
00:57:40.96 --> 00:57:44.16
And so I go in to see my CNC.

1654
00:57:44.16 --> 00:57:45.40
His name is Perry.

1655
00:57:45.40 --> 00:57:48.32
It's a total redneck, awesome guy.

1656
00:57:48.32 --> 00:57:51.68
And he goes, well, Van Orden, what you doing?

1657
00:57:51.68 --> 00:57:57.12
I go, Mass Chief, General Patton had to petition General

1658
00:57:57.12 --> 00:58:01.16
Pershing as a second lieutenant to be included on his

1659
00:58:01.16 --> 00:58:04.04
expedition during the Mexican-American War.

1660
00:58:04.04 --> 00:58:05.92
And he goes, you try to tell me.

1661
00:58:05.92 --> 00:58:09.52
You some kind of GD General Patton?

1662
00:58:09.52 --> 00:58:11.28
He did not abbreviate that.

1663
00:58:11.28 --> 00:58:12.52
And I said, no, Mass Chief.

1664
00:58:12.52 --> 00:58:14.40
But I'm telling you, my bags are packed right now.

1665
00:58:14.40 --> 00:58:15.88
And I can leave in 10 minutes.

1666
00:58:15.88 --> 00:58:17.92
And he's like, beat it.

1667
00:58:17.92 --> 00:58:20.20
Now, at this point, are you married?

1668
00:58:20.20 --> 00:58:21.12
You're married.

1669
00:58:21.12 --> 00:58:22.68
When did you meet your wife?

1670
00:58:22.68 --> 00:58:26.56
In San Diego, right before.

1671
00:58:26.56 --> 00:58:29.52
Right before I went to Buds, we got married right after Buds.

1672
00:58:29.52 --> 00:58:30.24
Got it.

1673
00:58:30.24 --> 00:58:34.60
So I spent, I was a seal for just under 22 years.

1674
00:58:34.60 --> 00:58:37.68
I spent 16 years away from home.

1675
00:58:37.68 --> 00:58:40.04
So I took every single training trip.

1676
00:58:40.04 --> 00:58:41.84
I went to every single school I could.

1677
00:58:41.84 --> 00:58:44.72
Because again, you have to find, if you're doing

1678
00:58:44.72 --> 00:58:47.16
something, do it.

1679
00:58:47.16 --> 00:58:49.48
And that's a biblical principle.

1680
00:58:49.48 --> 00:58:50.44
Be either hot or cold.

1681
00:58:50.44 --> 00:58:51.96
If you're lukewarm, I will spit you out.

1682
00:58:51.96 --> 00:58:53.48
That's in the Bible, man.

1683
00:58:53.48 --> 00:58:56.48
So if you're doing something, do it.

1684
00:58:56.48 --> 00:58:59.84
And so I got every single qualification I possibly could.

1685
00:58:59.84 --> 00:59:02.52
So in case something came up, I would be the one selected to

1686
00:59:02.52 --> 00:59:05.52
do it to go defend my country.

1687
00:59:05.52 --> 00:59:07.88
I mean, I'd live my life that way, right?

1688
00:59:07.88 --> 00:59:09.52
How fast did you have kids?

1689
00:59:09.52 --> 00:59:12.16
Did you have kids when you got to team four?

1690
00:59:12.16 --> 00:59:15.52
By the time we got to team four, we had two kids.

1691
00:59:15.52 --> 00:59:16.04
Damn.

1692
00:59:16.04 --> 00:59:16.76
Yeah.

1693
00:59:16.76 --> 00:59:17.36
And we have four now.

1694
00:59:17.36 --> 00:59:19.28
I have eight grandchildren.

1695
00:59:19.28 --> 00:59:19.96
Impressive.

1696
00:59:19.96 --> 00:59:21.96
Gosh, they're so awesome.

1697
00:59:21.96 --> 00:59:24.44
Everything you hear about being a granddad?

1698
00:59:24.44 --> 00:59:26.40
Not even close to how cool it is.

1699
00:59:26.40 --> 00:59:28.08
Seriously, they're just wonderful.

1700
00:59:28.08 --> 00:59:30.40
But yeah, so I went on that deployment.

1701
00:59:30.40 --> 00:59:32.68
It was very interesting.

1702
00:59:32.68 --> 00:59:35.44
I remember, so we had these different houses.

1703
00:59:35.44 --> 00:59:36.64
I didn't live in a base.

1704
00:59:36.64 --> 00:59:38.40
My house was Whiskey 40.

1705
00:59:38.40 --> 00:59:41.12
So it was multinational division Southwest.

1706
00:59:41.12 --> 00:59:44.56
I worked for a guy named John Cass, was a British colonel.

1707
00:59:44.56 --> 00:59:46.20
Reported to a special operations command

1708
00:59:46.20 --> 00:59:48.84
and control element, SOC-C. That was in Ponyluka.

1709
00:59:48.84 --> 00:59:50.76
The guy named Repass.

1710
00:59:50.76 --> 00:59:52.56
Mike Repass was a major at the time.

1711
00:59:52.56 --> 00:59:54.92
I wound up working for him again when he was a two star in Germany.

1712
00:59:54.92 --> 00:59:55.92
It was really cool.

1713
00:59:55.92 --> 01:00:00.04
But we went into Sarajevo, we fly in.

1714
01:00:00.04 --> 01:00:03.64
We went to another joint commission observer house, the SF guys.

1715
01:00:03.64 --> 01:00:06.16
And kind of like slowly get you in.

1716
01:00:06.16 --> 01:00:07.72
There's two seals there in my house.

1717
01:00:07.72 --> 01:00:12.32
And we moved out to Bugano, the town where they've been.

1718
01:00:12.32 --> 01:00:14.84
And then like seven to nine SF guys.

1719
01:00:14.84 --> 01:00:15.76
I get up every morning.

1720
01:00:15.76 --> 01:00:20.16
I drive out and I talk to all the military and local political

1721
01:00:20.16 --> 01:00:21.64
figures and police figures.

1722
01:00:21.64 --> 01:00:26.68
And the mission was to provide a ground truth about what's going on.

1723
01:00:26.68 --> 01:00:32.32
And I had so much responsibility as an E5,

1724
01:00:32.32 --> 01:00:34.32
like to plan these missions and go out.

1725
01:00:34.32 --> 01:00:38.56
And I had like a pistol and a butt pack with one other seal

1726
01:00:38.56 --> 01:00:39.76
with a pistol and a butt pack.

1727
01:00:39.76 --> 01:00:42.72
And you're going out and talking to these people

1728
01:00:42.72 --> 01:00:44.48
who just want to kill you.

1729
01:00:44.48 --> 01:00:50.44
And the level of, I guess the Yiddish term would be,

1730
01:00:50.44 --> 01:00:51.88
hutzpah.

1731
01:00:51.88 --> 01:00:52.84
You've got to get out there.

1732
01:00:52.84 --> 01:00:54.48
And I'll give you this example, man.

1733
01:00:54.48 --> 01:00:59.28
So we go up to Banyaluka to the 117th VRS.

1734
01:00:59.28 --> 01:01:03.96
That is a Serbian military unit.

1735
01:01:03.96 --> 01:01:05.88
I wanted to go check in with these cats.

1736
01:01:05.88 --> 01:01:08.64
And it's kind of on sort of on a little hill.

1737
01:01:08.64 --> 01:01:12.08
But back then for SACOM, you had to have the right look angle

1738
01:01:12.08 --> 01:01:12.58
and ask.

1739
01:01:12.58 --> 01:01:13.08
Remember?

1740
01:01:13.08 --> 01:01:14.36
Like you had a point at a Saturday.

1741
01:01:14.36 --> 01:01:14.76
I was a calm guy.

1742
01:01:14.76 --> 01:01:14.76
So yeah.

1743
01:01:14.76 --> 01:01:15.52
OK, yeah, right.

1744
01:01:15.52 --> 01:01:16.88
You get it.

1745
01:01:16.88 --> 01:01:17.76
Other people don't.

1746
01:01:17.76 --> 01:01:18.56
Where's my phone?

1747
01:01:18.56 --> 01:01:20.04
I can talk to it.

1748
01:01:20.04 --> 01:01:20.44
Anyone?

1749
01:01:20.44 --> 01:01:20.92
Anywhere.

1750
01:01:20.92 --> 01:01:21.20
Right.

1751
01:01:21.20 --> 01:01:24.000
So back then you had to like, boom, I had to get the satellite.

1752
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.40
So I had, I do the math problem.

1753
01:01:26.40 --> 01:01:27.32
I look at where I'm going.

1754
01:01:27.32 --> 01:01:33.36
I realize that I'll have to point this antenna into a mountain.

1755
01:01:33.36 --> 01:01:35.000
And I'm not getting comms.

1756
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.12
And there were no cell phones, right?

1757
01:01:37.12 --> 01:01:40.52
So I understand that, you know, it's just me and my buddy,

1758
01:01:40.52 --> 01:01:41.68
Meg.

1759
01:01:41.68 --> 01:01:42.68
So we go up there.

1760
01:01:42.68 --> 01:01:44.60
And I'm late.

1761
01:01:44.60 --> 01:01:46.04
Or excuse me, we're on time.

1762
01:01:46.04 --> 01:01:46.84
This guy's not there.

1763
01:01:46.84 --> 01:01:49.80
His name was Chulich, Colonel Chulich.

1764
01:01:49.80 --> 01:01:53.60
We walk in and there's this dude standing right there

1765
01:01:53.60 --> 01:01:57.92
who has got rosy cheeks like mine, huge white beard,

1766
01:01:57.92 --> 01:01:59.32
fatter belly than me.

1767
01:01:59.32 --> 01:02:02.32
And I'm like, oh my gosh, this guy looks like Santa Claus.

1768
01:02:02.32 --> 01:02:03.16
And I start chuckling.

1769
01:02:03.16 --> 01:02:04.32
So this is a Serbian base.

1770
01:02:04.32 --> 01:02:07.08
Remember, NATO had been bombing the Serbs.

1771
01:02:07.08 --> 01:02:08.16
And they are.

1772
01:02:08.16 --> 01:02:10.000
Yeah, well, isn't it 64 days or something?

1773
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:10.40
Right.

1774
01:02:10.40 --> 01:02:11.96
They want no part of us.

1775
01:02:11.96 --> 01:02:14.60
And so they are not happy.

1776
01:02:14.60 --> 01:02:17.16
And they're like, what are you talking about?

1777
01:02:17.16 --> 01:02:20.80
And my term, his name is Zoran Azuminidich.

1778
01:02:20.80 --> 01:02:25.40
We call him Zorca because he was fat and like Zorca, like Orca.

1779
01:02:25.40 --> 01:02:25.92
OK, got it.

1780
01:02:25.92 --> 01:02:26.12
Right.

1781
01:02:26.12 --> 01:02:31.04
So Zoran, they're like, he's starting to worry.

1782
01:02:31.04 --> 01:02:33.96
And they're like, what are you laughing at?

1783
01:02:33.96 --> 01:02:37.84
I go, all right, well, it looks like this is going down right now.

1784
01:02:37.84 --> 01:02:40.44
And there's like 400 Serbs there.

1785
01:02:40.44 --> 01:02:45.20
And two of us, we have 31 rounds of 9 millimeter with us.

1786
01:02:45.20 --> 01:02:46.36
Like that's it.

1787
01:02:46.36 --> 01:02:48.16
So I go, OK, hey, in the United States,

1788
01:02:48.16 --> 01:02:49.84
we have a guy whose name is Santa Claus.

1789
01:02:49.84 --> 01:02:51.48
And you look just like him.

1790
01:02:51.48 --> 01:02:52.48
That's what we're laughing at.

1791
01:02:52.48 --> 01:02:53.36
And they start laughing.

1792
01:02:53.36 --> 01:02:55.000
They go, oh, they're Serbian Orthodox.

1793
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:55.84
They have St. Nicholas.

1794
01:02:55.84 --> 01:02:58.60
They're like, that's what we call him too.

1795
01:02:58.60 --> 01:03:00.48
I was like, OK.

1796
01:03:00.48 --> 01:03:02.88
And then so we sit down at this table.

1797
01:03:02.88 --> 01:03:04.60
Chulich, yeah, that really happened.

1798
01:03:04.60 --> 01:03:05.12
It gets.

1799
01:03:05.12 --> 01:03:06.60
All of a sudden, an international incident,

1800
01:03:06.60 --> 01:03:08.44
because you were laughing at Santa's.

1801
01:03:08.44 --> 01:03:09.24
I couldn't help it.

1802
01:03:09.24 --> 01:03:10.36
Right, it gets more banana.

1803
01:03:10.36 --> 01:03:13.12
So we're sitting at this huge table.

1804
01:03:13.12 --> 01:03:16.24
And Chulich is supposed to show up at the head of the table.

1805
01:03:16.24 --> 01:03:17.80
And whenever you use an interpreter,

1806
01:03:17.80 --> 01:03:20.32
you put him in between you and whoever you're talking to.

1807
01:03:20.32 --> 01:03:25.48
So they should just be a conduit for language.

1808
01:03:25.48 --> 01:03:26.24
So he's sitting there.

1809
01:03:26.24 --> 01:03:28.20
This guy's just late, late, late, late.

1810
01:03:28.20 --> 01:03:32.64
We're sitting there drinking chlivovica, just plum brandy.

1811
01:03:32.64 --> 01:03:33.32
Excellent, actually.

1812
01:03:33.32 --> 01:03:36.08
In France, they call it O2D, water of life.

1813
01:03:36.08 --> 01:03:38.80
Maybe it's a mirror bill, in case you're wondering.

1814
01:03:38.80 --> 01:03:41.000
So this guy finally shows up.

1815
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.40
And my radio is in this rucksack.

1816
01:03:44.40 --> 01:03:47.64
And this dude, he's dressed like a Russian mafia guy.

1817
01:03:47.64 --> 01:03:49.000
This is the dude that just showed up?

1818
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.56
The colonel who should have been there three hours before.

1819
01:03:51.56 --> 01:03:53.24
He was in Bon Jovi, goofing off.

1820
01:03:53.24 --> 01:03:55.72
Anyway, black leather jacket, hair slicked back.

1821
01:03:55.72 --> 01:04:00.72
And he's like, you know, Serbians are great warriors.

1822
01:04:00.72 --> 01:04:02.64
I'm like, yeah, they are.

1823
01:04:02.64 --> 01:04:07.52
He goes, Serbians kept Europe safe from the Ottomans

1824
01:04:07.52 --> 01:04:08.88
for 300 years.

1825
01:04:08.88 --> 01:04:11.56
I'm like, yeah.

1826
01:04:11.56 --> 01:04:14.48
Serbians could kick NATO out of here anytime we want.

1827
01:04:14.48 --> 01:04:17.60
I look at him, I go, you see that radio?

1828
01:04:17.60 --> 01:04:18.80
Right there?

1829
01:04:18.80 --> 01:04:19.92
You keep that up.

1830
01:04:19.92 --> 01:04:22.96
I'm going to rain fire from the sky on you in 10 minutes.

1831
01:04:22.96 --> 01:04:23.92
Is that clear?

1832
01:04:23.92 --> 01:04:26.28
And Zoran, remember, I'm going to eat five, dude,

1833
01:04:26.28 --> 01:04:27.92
talking to this Serbian colonel.

1834
01:04:27.92 --> 01:04:28.60
So Zoran's there.

1835
01:04:28.60 --> 01:04:31.08
He's just like, like, instant sweat.

1836
01:04:31.08 --> 01:04:34.76
Like he just ate a ghost pepper.

1837
01:04:34.76 --> 01:04:39.48
And he's like, I go, Zoran, you tell him exactly what I said

1838
01:04:39.48 --> 01:04:41.96
right now, or you're out of here.

1839
01:04:41.96 --> 01:04:45.52
And he's like, OK.

1840
01:04:45.52 --> 01:04:46.72
You keep that up.

1841
01:04:46.72 --> 01:04:49.80
He's going to rain fire from the sky on you in 10 minutes.

1842
01:04:49.80 --> 01:04:53.60
And Tula just like, what I meant to say was the Serbians

1843
01:04:53.60 --> 01:04:55.76
and NATO can have an effective working relationship

1844
01:04:55.76 --> 01:04:57.32
to make sure that we secure peace and Bosnia.

1845
01:04:57.32 --> 01:04:58.80
I'm like, go check.

1846
01:04:58.80 --> 01:05:00.28
So we get down at the meeting.

1847
01:05:00.28 --> 01:05:01.88
It went really well after that.

1848
01:05:01.88 --> 01:05:03.64
We get back in the car and Zoran's like,

1849
01:05:03.64 --> 01:05:04.60
Derek, you know where you're at?

1850
01:05:04.60 --> 01:05:06.12
And I go, yeah, I'm in Kula Camp.

1851
01:05:06.12 --> 01:05:08.000
And he goes, do you know what happened to Kula Camp?

1852
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.32
I'm like, no.

1853
01:05:09.32 --> 01:05:12.44
So what I failed to notice is that all these buildings

1854
01:05:12.44 --> 01:05:14.48
were freshly painted and everything was nice.

1855
01:05:14.48 --> 01:05:15.48
They'd been destroyed.

1856
01:05:15.48 --> 01:05:17.52
They'd been destroyed by NATO.

1857
01:05:17.52 --> 01:05:20.68
So when I told that guy, I'll be raining fire from the sky

1858
01:05:20.68 --> 01:05:21.56
on you in 10 minutes.

1859
01:05:24.24 --> 01:05:27.08
He understood what that meant.

1860
01:05:27.08 --> 01:05:28.88
That terribly interesting.

1861
01:05:28.88 --> 01:05:29.84
That's crazy.

1862
01:05:29.84 --> 01:05:31.28
That's when I was at E5, dude.

1863
01:05:31.28 --> 01:05:32.84
Yeah.

1864
01:05:32.84 --> 01:05:35.80
That's crazy the amount of responsibility you can get.

1865
01:05:35.80 --> 01:05:36.56
Yeah.

1866
01:05:36.56 --> 01:05:39.48
We had in the military.

1867
01:05:39.48 --> 01:05:42.40
I was one of the guys that ran the six platoons.

1868
01:05:42.40 --> 01:05:44.24
The mission was de-classified in 2009.

1869
01:05:44.24 --> 01:05:47.12
So we protected the top six Iraqi officials.

1870
01:05:47.12 --> 01:05:49.44
And during the election cycle, I

1871
01:05:49.44 --> 01:05:51.32
had this guy named Ibrahim Al-Jafri.

1872
01:05:51.32 --> 01:05:53.04
So I was a platoon chief this time.

1873
01:05:53.04 --> 01:05:54.40
So this is team one?

1874
01:05:54.40 --> 01:05:56.72
No, this would be team five.

1875
01:05:56.72 --> 01:05:58.36
So I was at team four.

1876
01:05:58.36 --> 01:06:01.96
And then I went to 18 Delta.

1877
01:06:01.96 --> 01:06:02.92
I went to team one.

1878
01:06:02.92 --> 01:06:03.40
OK, so.

1879
01:06:03.40 --> 01:06:04.64
I'm going to pay a comp platoon there.

1880
01:06:04.64 --> 01:06:05.12
So hold on.

1881
01:06:05.12 --> 01:06:05.92
Slow down a little bit.

1882
01:06:05.92 --> 01:06:08.92
So you're at team four.

1883
01:06:08.92 --> 01:06:09.96
You get done at team four.

1884
01:06:09.96 --> 01:06:10.52
Correct.

1885
01:06:10.52 --> 01:06:12.12
And you get done with the Spositing Deployment,

1886
01:06:12.12 --> 01:06:13.12
which is an awesome deployment.

1887
01:06:13.12 --> 01:06:14.48
But back then, it's like you were.

1888
01:06:14.48 --> 01:06:15.68
It was the only war we had.

1889
01:06:15.68 --> 01:06:20.16
The most stoked you could possibly be at that time.

1890
01:06:20.16 --> 01:06:24.48
And then you get forced to go to 18 Delta against your will.

1891
01:06:24.48 --> 01:06:24.84
Right.

1892
01:06:24.84 --> 01:06:26.04
But you go down there and kick ass.

1893
01:06:26.04 --> 01:06:26.44
Correct.

1894
01:06:26.44 --> 01:06:27.80
Graduate number one guy in the class.

1895
01:06:27.80 --> 01:06:29.12
That is correct.

1896
01:06:29.12 --> 01:06:31.92
Now what happens?

1897
01:06:31.92 --> 01:06:33.000
OK.

1898
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.32
So I was supposed to go to Damneck.

1899
01:06:36.32 --> 01:06:37.36
You know all you have to see, daddy's,

1900
01:06:37.36 --> 01:06:39.28
and they lay out your whole plan for you.

1901
01:06:39.28 --> 01:06:41.24
And the corpsman detailer is for same as Tom.

1902
01:06:41.24 --> 01:06:42.36
He's a very good guy.

1903
01:06:42.36 --> 01:06:43.80
I don't worries that now.

1904
01:06:43.80 --> 01:06:46.84
So the plan was for me to finish 18 Delta.

1905
01:06:46.84 --> 01:06:49.28
And at that point, they were only taking 8490 ones.

1906
01:06:49.28 --> 01:06:50.64
That's the senior level.

1907
01:06:50.64 --> 01:06:51.80
It's for your audience.

1908
01:06:51.80 --> 01:06:52.88
So there's 8492s.

1909
01:06:52.88 --> 01:06:55.48
That's the basic Special Forces medic.

1910
01:06:55.48 --> 01:06:58.32
And then the full graduate of the Army Special Forces

1911
01:06:58.32 --> 01:06:59.20
medical sergeant's corps.

1912
01:06:59.20 --> 01:07:02.76
That time Damneck was only taking these guys.

1913
01:07:02.76 --> 01:07:04.96
So that's why I had to go to 18 Delta.

1914
01:07:04.96 --> 01:07:06.84
Tom sets all the set.

1915
01:07:06.84 --> 01:07:08.08
But then I'm sitting there.

1916
01:07:08.08 --> 01:07:11.52
Remember, this is 98, 99-ish.

1917
01:07:11.52 --> 01:07:15.56
And I had been gone for the five and plus years I was at team

1918
01:07:15.56 --> 01:07:16.20
four.

1919
01:07:16.20 --> 01:07:19.60
And Sarah and I had three kids at the time.

1920
01:07:19.60 --> 01:07:21.52
She's a San Diego native.

1921
01:07:21.52 --> 01:07:23.32
And I really felt horrible.

1922
01:07:23.32 --> 01:07:24.12
You know what I mean?

1923
01:07:24.12 --> 01:07:26.24
Because I'm a husband and a dad and all this stuff.

1924
01:07:26.24 --> 01:07:28.12
And her family's still here.

1925
01:07:28.12 --> 01:07:30.44
They're wonderful.

1926
01:07:30.44 --> 01:07:32.04
So I was like, you know what?

1927
01:07:32.04 --> 01:07:35.16
I'm going to ask to get assigned to the West Coast

1928
01:07:35.16 --> 01:07:38.48
so that I can continue to work as a frogman as I should.

1929
01:07:38.48 --> 01:07:40.60
But she'll have more support network around me.

1930
01:07:40.60 --> 01:07:41.76
Or around her, sorry.

1931
01:07:41.76 --> 01:07:46.08
So we're sitting in this meeting.

1932
01:07:46.08 --> 01:07:47.32
Tom pulls all the corps around.

1933
01:07:47.32 --> 01:07:48.08
Where do you want to go?

1934
01:07:48.08 --> 01:07:49.000
Where do you want to go?

1935
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.28
And he's asking them, bam, bam, bam, east coast, west coast,

1936
01:07:51.28 --> 01:07:52.28
whatever.

1937
01:07:52.28 --> 01:07:55.92
And he looks to me and he's like just skipping over me.

1938
01:07:55.92 --> 01:07:57.04
And I said west coast.

1939
01:07:57.04 --> 01:07:59.40
And he was like, what?

1940
01:07:59.40 --> 01:08:01.08
I go, yeah, west coast, man.

1941
01:08:01.08 --> 01:08:03.32
He's like, check.

1942
01:08:03.32 --> 01:08:04.08
Goes around everybody.

1943
01:08:04.08 --> 01:08:07.68
I put in five, because that was the team four.

1944
01:08:07.68 --> 01:08:08.64
Then I put in three.

1945
01:08:08.64 --> 01:08:09.68
Then I put in one.

1946
01:08:09.68 --> 01:08:13.20
Now this is the person that decides where you are going.

1947
01:08:13.20 --> 01:08:15.08
Like it is up to him.

1948
01:08:15.08 --> 01:08:16.16
Where did I go?

1949
01:08:16.16 --> 01:08:17.36
Team one.

1950
01:08:17.36 --> 01:08:21.88
He was so mad at me personally.

1951
01:08:21.88 --> 01:08:23.68
And it was a great experience there.

1952
01:08:23.68 --> 01:08:26.32
But it was just so different.

1953
01:08:26.32 --> 01:08:29.56
Like I got yelled at, I would say,

1954
01:08:29.56 --> 01:08:31.36
40 times in the first two months I was there.

1955
01:08:31.36 --> 01:08:32.96
Because I had the wrong pair at team one.

1956
01:08:32.96 --> 01:08:33.60
At Stalard team one.

1957
01:08:33.60 --> 01:08:35.12
When did you get there?

1958
01:08:35.12 --> 01:08:37.12
Gosh, he was 98, late 98.

1959
01:08:37.12 --> 01:08:38.16
So FAC was there.

1960
01:08:38.16 --> 01:08:39.76
And you know, the overshadings.

1961
01:08:39.76 --> 01:08:41.56
So I left in 98.

1962
01:08:41.56 --> 01:08:41.96
OK, so that's.

1963
01:08:41.96 --> 01:08:43.80
So you had just, we just missed.

1964
01:08:43.80 --> 01:08:45.72
I left.

1965
01:08:45.72 --> 01:08:49.12
I left in the spring of 98.

1966
01:08:49.12 --> 01:08:51.24
So if you didn't get there until.

1967
01:08:51.24 --> 01:08:53.08
I can't remember.

1968
01:08:53.08 --> 01:08:55.92
I deployed in 2000.

1969
01:08:55.92 --> 01:08:57.96
So whatever that cycle would be.

1970
01:08:57.96 --> 01:08:59.32
So yeah, I left in the spring of 98.

1971
01:08:59.32 --> 01:09:04.04
But yeah, at that time, just we called team one, Stalard team

1972
01:09:04.04 --> 01:09:05.92
one, because it was like strict.

1973
01:09:05.92 --> 01:09:08.84
And it was traditional and it was uniform inspections

1974
01:09:08.84 --> 01:09:11.48
and haircut inspections and all these kind of things

1975
01:09:11.48 --> 01:09:12.20
were going on.

1976
01:09:12.20 --> 01:09:14.08
And I loved it.

1977
01:09:14.08 --> 01:09:16.000
And well, that's why you wrote a book called

1978
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.92
like Discipline Equals Freedom.

1979
01:09:17.92 --> 01:09:19.08
And I didn't.

1980
01:09:19.08 --> 01:09:20.52
Let's just be really clear about that.

1981
01:09:20.52 --> 01:09:21.60
You know what I mean?

1982
01:09:21.60 --> 01:09:22.20
Yeah.

1983
01:09:22.20 --> 01:09:24.36
And it's one of those things where, you know, that's where I

1984
01:09:24.36 --> 01:09:27.60
was kind of raised, you know, from a young kid to, you know,

1985
01:09:27.60 --> 01:09:30.68
that's where I've got all my first experience.

1986
01:09:30.68 --> 01:09:32.64
And you know, like you talk about faculty,

1987
01:09:32.64 --> 01:09:34.56
faculty was like my.

1988
01:09:34.56 --> 01:09:35.60
It's a legend.

1989
01:09:35.60 --> 01:09:40.32
And like a legit friend who looked out for me and my group

1990
01:09:40.32 --> 01:09:44.28
of friends, we were all kind of his boys.

1991
01:09:44.28 --> 01:09:46.88
And you know, we worked, we freaking busted our ass.

1992
01:09:46.88 --> 01:09:48.64
And that's what, you know, what happened?

1993
01:09:48.64 --> 01:09:51.16
I remember you checking out because you were there with Chris.

1994
01:09:51.16 --> 01:09:51.84
Yeah.

1995
01:09:51.84 --> 01:09:52.28
Yeah.

1996
01:09:52.28 --> 01:09:53.36
Yeah.

1997
01:09:53.36 --> 01:09:53.84
Yeah.

1998
01:09:53.84 --> 01:09:54.36
That's when I was.

1999
01:09:54.36 --> 01:09:57.36
And I was I was I was sailor of the year at team one.

2000
01:09:57.36 --> 01:09:58.68
Well, yeah, that was.

2001
01:09:58.68 --> 01:10:03.56
But I was the only five in history.

2002
01:10:03.56 --> 01:10:05.000
You made E5 or I was.

2003
01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.08
You're a Z five.

2004
01:10:06.08 --> 01:10:08.48
Silt and one as any five, which was crazy.

2005
01:10:08.48 --> 01:10:11.72
But part of that was because of fact, like fact, like, you know,

2006
01:10:11.72 --> 01:10:13.20
I was worked hard for fact.

2007
01:10:13.20 --> 01:10:16.32
I worked right for him in training cell and stuff.

2008
01:10:16.32 --> 01:10:19.92
But yeah, it was this very strict environment of much more

2009
01:10:19.92 --> 01:10:22.96
militaristic than the other teams.

2010
01:10:22.96 --> 01:10:25.64
And I went from there to team two and team two was similar.

2011
01:10:25.64 --> 01:10:25.96
Right.

2012
01:10:25.96 --> 01:10:26.96
That was it was.

2013
01:10:26.96 --> 01:10:27.92
No, we call it.

2014
01:10:27.92 --> 01:10:29.56
Yeah, it was pretty solid.

2015
01:10:29.56 --> 01:10:30.48
They're the same.

2016
01:10:30.48 --> 01:10:31.36
They were they were the same.

2017
01:10:31.36 --> 01:10:35.36
Tilting one and till team two were definitely on the spectrum

2018
01:10:35.36 --> 01:10:37.72
of way more militaristic way.

2019
01:10:37.72 --> 01:10:40.96
So that's and you know what happened at team one, a lot of guys

2020
01:10:40.96 --> 01:10:46.16
from team one would hate it and would go to team five.

2021
01:10:46.16 --> 01:10:48.32
They would go down the street, team five and just be like, oh,

2022
01:10:48.32 --> 01:10:50.08
now we can like act like humans.

2023
01:10:50.08 --> 01:10:50.52
Right.

2024
01:10:50.52 --> 01:10:51.68
And be chill.

2025
01:10:51.68 --> 01:10:53.28
And so and that would be cool.

2026
01:10:53.28 --> 01:10:54.84
That's a that's a nice transition.

2027
01:10:54.84 --> 01:10:57.04
Your transition in the opposite direction is not a nice transition.

2028
01:10:57.04 --> 01:10:59.20
It was like I'd had the wrong Paris.

2029
01:10:59.20 --> 01:11:00.04
There's like a matrix.

2030
01:11:00.04 --> 01:11:02.84
So Dean Cummings, who is he's a great dude.

2031
01:11:02.84 --> 01:11:04.68
I mean, he was the CMC there.

2032
01:11:04.68 --> 01:11:08.28
And it was always like fan art and you know, this hat and the socks

2033
01:11:08.28 --> 01:11:09.96
and this shoes and whatever.

2034
01:11:09.96 --> 01:11:13.44
I'm like, so finally I go, hey, Mastery, remember, I've done two platoons.

2035
01:11:13.44 --> 01:11:17.64
One combat deployment to Bosnia was the I got the defense

2036
01:11:17.64 --> 01:11:21.60
maritory service medal as the most highly decorated guy for my rotation

2037
01:11:21.60 --> 01:11:23.16
because of some other stuff that I did there.

2038
01:11:23.16 --> 01:11:25.04
Right.

2039
01:11:25.04 --> 01:11:27.96
Honor graduate of my Army Special Forces Medical Stardust course.

2040
01:11:27.96 --> 01:11:31.76
I'm not some new guy that just fell off, you know, the Bud's train.

2041
01:11:31.76 --> 01:11:32.12
Right.

2042
01:11:32.12 --> 01:11:34.28
I am experienced at that point.

2043
01:11:34.28 --> 01:11:35.64
I was a journeyman seal.

2044
01:11:35.64 --> 01:11:36.08
Yeah.

2045
01:11:36.08 --> 01:11:37.04
You know what I mean?

2046
01:11:37.04 --> 01:11:37.88
Not a master.

2047
01:11:37.88 --> 01:11:39.04
I was a journeyman.

2048
01:11:39.04 --> 01:11:42.60
And finally, I'm like, hey, Mastery, can I get like a matrix

2049
01:11:42.60 --> 01:11:44.04
of what I can wear with what?

2050
01:11:44.04 --> 01:11:46.52
Because I'm not doing this on purpose.

2051
01:11:46.52 --> 01:11:50.16
I just don't know what you expect me to wear every day.

2052
01:11:50.16 --> 01:11:52.20
So P.T. is this and then you change it.

2053
01:11:52.20 --> 01:11:55.32
He was like fan art and I go, I'm not joking.

2054
01:11:55.32 --> 01:11:55.76
Yeah.

2055
01:11:55.76 --> 01:11:57.000
Then he realized I was sincere.

2056
01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:57.24
Yeah.

2057
01:11:57.24 --> 01:11:58.28
You know, because.

2058
01:11:58.28 --> 01:12:01.20
Dude, the guy you're talking about, Chris, who's like one of the biggest

2059
01:12:01.20 --> 01:12:05.88
studs in human history, but we were in Bud's together.

2060
01:12:05.88 --> 01:12:05.96
Yeah.

2061
01:12:05.96 --> 01:12:09.24
And then we get to team one and we're going on a run like we're new guys.

2062
01:12:09.24 --> 01:12:09.44
Yeah.

2063
01:12:09.44 --> 01:12:10.72
And he walks out for the run.

2064
01:12:10.72 --> 01:12:14.64
He's wearing a visor, like a visor like, you know, like, I don't know.

2065
01:12:14.64 --> 01:12:15.68
He still wears a visor.

2066
01:12:15.68 --> 01:12:16.68
We used to cut those.

2067
01:12:16.68 --> 01:12:17.56
The hat off.

2068
01:12:17.56 --> 01:12:17.76
Yeah.

2069
01:12:17.76 --> 01:12:21.56
So he walks out with a visor on and faculty who didn't know us at the time,

2070
01:12:21.56 --> 01:12:26.32
we're just new guys, looks at him and he goes, if I see you wearing that again,

2071
01:12:26.32 --> 01:12:28.000
I'm sending you to the fleet.

2072
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.80
Like, like we just got that with Bud's and he's telling him he's going to send

2073
01:12:33.80 --> 01:12:35.20
him to the fleet.

2074
01:12:35.20 --> 01:12:35.36
Yeah.

2075
01:12:35.36 --> 01:12:40.52
And by the way, this guy, Chris is like this, a total stud in every way.

2076
01:12:40.52 --> 01:12:42.24
He's one of those mutant humans.

2077
01:12:42.24 --> 01:12:42.40
Yeah.

2078
01:12:42.40 --> 01:12:43.000
He's a mutant human.

2079
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:43.88
That is incredible.

2080
01:12:43.88 --> 01:12:45.80
And he relieved me in Iraq.

2081
01:12:45.80 --> 01:12:46.24
Okay.

2082
01:12:46.24 --> 01:12:47.20
I got a cool story about that.

2083
01:12:47.20 --> 01:12:47.92
Remind me of that.

2084
01:12:47.92 --> 01:12:49.36
Nice.

2085
01:12:49.36 --> 01:12:54.32
So you eventually figure out what you got to do to keep your, keep forgetting

2086
01:12:54.32 --> 01:12:55.88
your astute at the whole team one.

2087
01:12:55.88 --> 01:12:56.96
Correct.

2088
01:12:56.96 --> 01:13:01.60
Do a pay-com deployment and then force 21 came about.

2089
01:13:01.60 --> 01:13:02.20
Remember that?

2090
01:13:02.20 --> 01:13:03.40
Thankfully.

2091
01:13:03.40 --> 01:13:03.96
Thankfully.

2092
01:13:03.96 --> 01:13:09.64
Well, thankfully and no, there's some very distinct, I mean, like hardcore

2093
01:13:09.64 --> 01:13:12.44
negative squalor because of force 21.

2094
01:13:12.44 --> 01:13:15.64
The first and foremost one is it seals don't want to do stuff anymore.

2095
01:13:15.64 --> 01:13:16.40
Yeah.

2096
01:13:16.40 --> 01:13:20.52
I guess the thing is at that time, it was needed.

2097
01:13:20.52 --> 01:13:25.44
It was needed and it was lucky because if we were gone from the old system into

2098
01:13:25.44 --> 01:13:28.88
what we ended up deploying as once not 11, it would have been really much harder

2099
01:13:28.88 --> 01:13:29.28
transition.

2100
01:13:29.28 --> 01:13:30.08
We would have pulled it off.

2101
01:13:30.08 --> 01:13:32.52
And when I say seals don't want to do stuff anymore, I mean, we're stone cold

2102
01:13:32.52 --> 01:13:33.68
killers, right?

2103
01:13:33.68 --> 01:13:34.56
That's not changed.

2104
01:13:34.56 --> 01:13:36.40
I just mean like the day to day sort of things.

2105
01:13:36.40 --> 01:13:39.28
We've lost that.

2106
01:13:39.28 --> 01:13:43.000
We've lost the ability to like learn how to sew your own gear because people, I

2107
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.64
know how to use an industrial sewing machine as did everybody in the

2108
01:13:45.64 --> 01:13:47.92
seal teams because you'd make your own stuff in the parallel.

2109
01:13:47.92 --> 01:13:48.56
Things like that.

2110
01:13:48.56 --> 01:13:50.12
How do you build a duck and whatnot?

2111
01:13:50.12 --> 01:13:52.28
But so.

2112
01:13:52.28 --> 01:13:55.52
What was your job in your platoon at team one?

2113
01:13:55.52 --> 01:13:56.72
I was a corpsman.

2114
01:13:56.72 --> 01:13:57.56
So, so yeah.

2115
01:13:57.56 --> 01:13:58.52
And I was a Intel guy.

2116
01:13:58.52 --> 01:13:59.24
That's what I did.

2117
01:13:59.24 --> 01:13:59.88
That's your thing.

2118
01:13:59.88 --> 01:14:01.04
That's my thing.

2119
01:14:01.04 --> 01:14:01.60
I got it.

2120
01:14:01.60 --> 01:14:08.28
But so force 21 comes around and again, I was I was distinctly

2121
01:14:08.28 --> 01:14:12.48
dissatisfied with the line of warfare training that I got at team one.

2122
01:14:12.48 --> 01:14:18.80
I it was it was not adequate because remember I came from team four where you

2123
01:14:18.80 --> 01:14:20.40
spent that was what you did.

2124
01:14:20.40 --> 01:14:24.84
I mean, you lived in the J and so I'm like, there's no war going on.

2125
01:14:24.84 --> 01:14:25.48
There's nothing.

2126
01:14:25.48 --> 01:14:29.72
I go, I'm going to and remember it was over at Brown or Turner field.

2127
01:14:29.72 --> 01:14:33.24
What's the you know, next to the building's over in Coronado.

2128
01:14:33.24 --> 01:14:37.84
What do we what do we talk about that field Turner field or yeah, Turner field.

2129
01:14:37.84 --> 01:14:38.08
Yeah.

2130
01:14:38.08 --> 01:14:38.40
Okay.

2131
01:14:38.40 --> 01:14:41.40
So this is this is how discombobulated this wasn't it's fascinating.

2132
01:14:41.40 --> 01:14:44.88
They just put the road cones like they put a road cone with like team one,

2133
01:14:44.88 --> 01:14:48.56
team five, team three, trade at and you would go stand behind the road cone.

2134
01:14:48.56 --> 01:14:50.20
That's how I got to trade it.

2135
01:14:50.20 --> 01:14:55.40
I stood behind a road cone because that's how they figured out how to detail people.

2136
01:14:55.40 --> 01:14:56.44
Yeah.

2137
01:14:56.44 --> 01:14:57.48
It was kind of cool.

2138
01:14:57.48 --> 01:14:59.64
Actually, it started cool, but it was a mess.

2139
01:14:59.64 --> 01:15:03.96
And so I walk over to the building, the Starship, you know, I don't know if

2140
01:15:03.96 --> 01:15:07.64
they're even there anymore, but the one that was shared by one and three and we

2141
01:15:07.64 --> 01:15:09.56
started trade out.

2142
01:15:09.56 --> 01:15:11.28
We had like the second floor or whatever it was.

2143
01:15:11.28 --> 01:15:12.52
I walk in an empty room.

2144
01:15:12.52 --> 01:15:15.24
It's me and Jeff Green.

2145
01:15:15.24 --> 01:15:20.04
Then we're like, we're it like we're getting them trade land warfare.

2146
01:15:20.04 --> 01:15:27.04
And so I went through everybody's safes in all of the teams and I took all of their

2147
01:15:27.04 --> 01:15:33.04
documentation going back to the Vietnam War, you know, the type stuff, after action reports,

2148
01:15:33.04 --> 01:15:38.04
and I consolidated all those things and we wrote all of the curriculum for land warfare

2149
01:15:38.04 --> 01:15:41.80
and then special reconnaissance, taking the lessons and going back from our forefathers

2150
01:15:41.80 --> 01:15:47.72
that gave us our, you know, fierce reputation and then worked those over and over again.

2151
01:15:47.72 --> 01:15:55.60
But I get there, we start doing that and then September 11th happens and I was down.

2152
01:15:55.60 --> 01:15:59.84
We lived in Navy housing and I'm like, what the heck?

2153
01:15:59.84 --> 01:16:05.36
We got a phone call from a guy named Andy Dalton, retired SEAL Senior Chief, his wife,

2154
01:16:05.36 --> 01:16:07.04
Cheryl, just beautiful people.

2155
01:16:07.04 --> 01:16:08.04
It's wonderful.

2156
01:16:08.04 --> 01:16:09.04
Oops, sorry.

2157
01:16:09.04 --> 01:16:14.52
And he's that team too at the time and they're like, turn on your television.

2158
01:16:14.52 --> 01:16:17.88
So we turn it on and we're like, what the heck is going on?

2159
01:16:17.88 --> 01:16:21.08
And so I go, hey honey, keep the kids home from school.

2160
01:16:21.08 --> 01:16:22.76
I do not know what's happening.

2161
01:16:22.76 --> 01:16:24.68
I drive to the team area.

2162
01:16:24.68 --> 01:16:26.36
We get snipers up in the building.

2163
01:16:26.36 --> 01:16:27.36
We don't know what's happening.

2164
01:16:27.36 --> 01:16:32.32
And I remember I went with this big VAT board, this big white board and I took a red marker

2165
01:16:32.32 --> 01:16:36.52
and I wrote war and these big letters right there.

2166
01:16:36.52 --> 01:16:41.56
And at that point we had desks and everything like war, like it's on.

2167
01:16:41.56 --> 01:16:47.04
And so from that point on, I try to get out of there because we're at war, right?

2168
01:16:47.04 --> 01:16:50.96
And a lot of people was the skipper there and every morning I go in his office just

2169
01:16:50.96 --> 01:16:53.32
like I do parry beers.

2170
01:16:53.32 --> 01:16:56.04
Like, okay, I'm ready to go back to the back.

2171
01:16:56.04 --> 01:16:58.76
He's like, you're going to Afghanistan when I go to Afghanistan, Vano.

2172
01:16:58.76 --> 01:17:02.24
And I'm like, ready to go every morning, every morning, ready to go, ready to go.

2173
01:17:02.24 --> 01:17:04.40
And then we're going out to Nile and I think I was gone.

2174
01:17:04.40 --> 01:17:07.76
I mean, like 290 days that year.

2175
01:17:07.76 --> 01:17:11.20
Then finally he's like, okay, you can go leave me alone.

2176
01:17:11.20 --> 01:17:16.52
So I weaseled my way into an L and O position for the siege of Sodov and I worked that for

2177
01:17:16.52 --> 01:17:20.88
about a month and then I was down working for the chief of station in Kabul because

2178
01:17:20.88 --> 01:17:22.36
I identified a problem.

2179
01:17:22.36 --> 01:17:27.64
I looked at the entire spectrum of all of the operations that were taking place and

2180
01:17:27.64 --> 01:17:32.96
I'm looking, we were completely, we were not employed to the capacity that we should be

2181
01:17:32.96 --> 01:17:36.72
as seals and it's because we didn't have assets and authorities and all this stuff.

2182
01:17:36.72 --> 01:17:41.52
So I laid this plan out and I'm like, if we tied this asset to this person who has control

2183
01:17:41.52 --> 01:17:45.72
over this, then we can execute the mission better as seals.

2184
01:17:45.72 --> 01:17:49.84
And I went to John, what was his name?

2185
01:17:49.84 --> 01:17:50.84
Sileski.

2186
01:17:50.84 --> 01:17:53.32
Colonel Sileski was the siege, siege of the commander.

2187
01:17:53.32 --> 01:17:56.96
I said, Colonel, NAV's office not being employed to our capacity.

2188
01:17:56.96 --> 01:17:58.84
And he's like, I know what's going on.

2189
01:17:58.84 --> 01:18:02.60
I said, sure, if we do this, this, this, this and this and he goes, sorry, beat it.

2190
01:18:02.60 --> 01:18:06.16
He was, he was the finest joint warfare fighter I've ever worked with.

2191
01:18:06.16 --> 01:18:07.84
I mean, repass was another one.

2192
01:18:07.84 --> 01:18:09.04
He's another army guy, unfortunately.

2193
01:18:09.04 --> 01:18:13.24
I wish he could lay out this list of seal admirals.

2194
01:18:13.24 --> 01:18:18.72
I can say that about, there's a few, but yeah, John was just, he was amazing.

2195
01:18:18.72 --> 01:18:21.04
And he's like a down there and get it on.

2196
01:18:21.04 --> 01:18:22.52
Fan, oh, what's up?

2197
01:18:22.52 --> 01:18:23.52
Beat feet.

2198
01:18:23.52 --> 01:18:31.88
So we tied together for theater soft, the first real interagency integration.

2199
01:18:31.88 --> 01:18:32.88
Like biometrics.

2200
01:18:32.88 --> 01:18:33.88
Remember biometrics?

2201
01:18:33.88 --> 01:18:40.28
So everyone's like, so I was there and I was sitting around, you know, reflecting because

2202
01:18:40.28 --> 01:18:41.28
you should reflect.

2203
01:18:41.28 --> 01:18:47.72
And I was looking at one of those charts where it has all the people on a targeted list.

2204
01:18:47.72 --> 01:18:53.36
And I was like, we don't know who is still around off this list.

2205
01:18:53.36 --> 01:18:55.12
We don't know.

2206
01:18:55.12 --> 01:18:57.16
And so I went and talked to a guy named Jax.

2207
01:18:57.16 --> 01:18:58.52
He's still a super good friend of mine.

2208
01:18:58.52 --> 01:19:01.12
He's the senior FBI agent in the country.

2209
01:19:01.12 --> 01:19:06.60
And his office was right around the corner from my down in Kabul at the annex.

2210
01:19:06.60 --> 01:19:13.32
And I'm like, Jax, how does the FBI know who people are after they're deceased?

2211
01:19:13.32 --> 01:19:16.96
And he's like, well, you know, we do fingerprints.

2212
01:19:16.96 --> 01:19:17.96
We do all the stuff.

2213
01:19:17.96 --> 01:19:19.12
And I go, okay.

2214
01:19:19.12 --> 01:19:20.60
So how do we do that here?

2215
01:19:20.60 --> 01:19:22.48
And he's like, well, I don't know.

2216
01:19:22.48 --> 01:19:24.44
I mean, this is a huge story.

2217
01:19:24.44 --> 01:19:30.36
So I figured out a thing for us to be able to initially fingerprint folks.

2218
01:19:30.36 --> 01:19:35.08
So the first time, this is why I am the force comp of the SEAL teams.

2219
01:19:35.08 --> 01:19:39.20
So the first time that theater soft ever used biometrics in Afghanistan really in the war

2220
01:19:39.20 --> 01:19:43.96
and terror was because I cooked up this idea with this dude who was on the Memphis SWAT

2221
01:19:43.96 --> 01:19:45.76
team.

2222
01:19:45.76 --> 01:19:49.72
And so we went out to this very complicated series of stuff.

2223
01:19:49.72 --> 01:19:54.52
They see what 30 and 47s and all night and you know, big target deck and everything.

2224
01:19:54.52 --> 01:20:01.76
And he had like the Johnny G man, you know, 1930s FBI fingerprint kit, the blue suitcase

2225
01:20:01.76 --> 01:20:05.72
with the silver corners to fingerprint.

2226
01:20:05.72 --> 01:20:10.04
These, you know, the enemy combatants that were no longer around.

2227
01:20:10.04 --> 01:20:11.88
That's how all that started.

2228
01:20:11.88 --> 01:20:15.12
That was an incredibly interesting thing, man.

2229
01:20:15.12 --> 01:20:19.000
And then I rolled back and I went to team five where I was a potential.

2230
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000
What year was that?

2231
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000
What year was that?

2232
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000
They were you in Afghanistan?

2233
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000
2003.

2234
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.92
I left October 13th, 2003.

2235
01:20:25.92 --> 01:20:28.80
I remember that because it's the.

2236
01:20:28.80 --> 01:20:31.68
That's when you left Afghanistan for my first tour.

2237
01:20:31.68 --> 01:20:32.68
Yeah.

2238
01:20:32.68 --> 01:20:33.68
Wait, you left for Afghanistan?

2239
01:20:33.68 --> 01:20:35.24
No, I came back.

2240
01:20:35.24 --> 01:20:36.24
Got it.

2241
01:20:36.24 --> 01:20:37.24
I came back.

2242
01:20:37.24 --> 01:20:40.12
So it took me, I was there for six or seven months.

2243
01:20:40.12 --> 01:20:44.52
So, you know, do the math between September 11th to that point.

2244
01:20:44.52 --> 01:20:47.12
But that's the birthday of the Navy.

2245
01:20:47.12 --> 01:20:48.12
There you go.

2246
01:20:48.12 --> 01:20:50.12
I was not aware of that.

2247
01:20:50.12 --> 01:20:51.12
What?

2248
01:20:51.12 --> 01:20:52.12
Yeah.

2249
01:20:52.12 --> 01:20:53.12
I was like, horrible sailor.

2250
01:20:53.12 --> 01:20:54.12
I'm horrible.

2251
01:20:54.12 --> 01:20:55.12
I'm horrible sailor.

2252
01:20:55.12 --> 01:20:56.12
Sorry about that.

2253
01:20:56.12 --> 01:21:01.000
But, um, yeah, I came back and I went to team five where I was a potential.

2254
01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.16
So you get to team five now it's 2003.

2255
01:21:04.16 --> 01:21:08.000
So at this point we are full on like everyone's going to war.

2256
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000
To win it.

2257
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.84
Iraq opened up right when I got back from Afghanistan.

2258
01:21:11.84 --> 01:21:13.80
I can't remember when we invaded, but it was right around there.

2259
01:21:13.80 --> 01:21:17.16
I saw it was so the plan for that was 1003 Victor.

2260
01:21:17.16 --> 01:21:24.000
So 1003 was the baseline operational plan and then the letters on the end are how many,

2261
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.28
um, how many different right.

2262
01:21:26.28 --> 01:21:27.28
So it got down to Victor.

2263
01:21:27.28 --> 01:21:31.08
So 1003 Victor was the plan while I left and all the heavy lift aircraft started leaving

2264
01:21:31.08 --> 01:21:33.16
Afghanistan when I was there.

2265
01:21:33.16 --> 01:21:36.12
And I'm like, there's only so much heavy lift aircraft.

2266
01:21:36.12 --> 01:21:40.60
I go, Oh my gosh, they're going to do 1003 Victor.

2267
01:21:40.60 --> 01:21:45.52
So me coming back, I don't know exactly the periodicity when that they actually invasion

2268
01:21:45.52 --> 01:21:51.60
kicked off, but I knew it was going to happen because of the heavy lift aircraft.

2269
01:21:51.60 --> 01:21:56.72
So you know, I'm a platoon chief and I want to go to war with my dudes.

2270
01:21:56.72 --> 01:22:02.40
I mean, I, there's one of these books written by Dick couch that they interviewed us when

2271
01:22:02.40 --> 01:22:04.84
I was teaching land warfare.

2272
01:22:04.84 --> 01:22:07.04
And in that book, I'm like, he's like, what do you want to do?

2273
01:22:07.04 --> 01:22:09.84
Essentially, I'm like, my goal is to become a platoon chief.

2274
01:22:09.84 --> 01:22:10.84
Like that's it.

2275
01:22:10.84 --> 01:22:15.76
That to me, that's a pinnacle of a enlisted sales job has been opportunity.

2276
01:22:15.76 --> 01:22:19.44
I was a troop chief later, but that was, you know, the thing.

2277
01:22:19.44 --> 01:22:23.88
And then we wind up, they, they get this mission, this mission set protecting these

2278
01:22:23.88 --> 01:22:24.88
Iraqi dignitaries.

2279
01:22:24.88 --> 01:22:28.36
And I'm like, Oh man.

2280
01:22:28.36 --> 01:22:34.76
So I mean, not that it's not important, but the war was not going well at the time.

2281
01:22:34.76 --> 01:22:38.32
And again, I said this earlier, but that mission is declassified in 2009.

2282
01:22:38.32 --> 01:22:42.76
So the top six Iraqi officials were protected by seal patents.

2283
01:22:42.76 --> 01:22:45.000
Then it's kind of cool.

2284
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.84
They randomly assigned NFL football teams names.

2285
01:22:48.84 --> 01:22:51.04
That was your, your call sign.

2286
01:22:51.04 --> 01:22:52.04
Guess what mine was?

2287
01:22:52.04 --> 01:22:53.04
No idea.

2288
01:22:53.04 --> 01:22:54.04
Packers from Wisconsin.

2289
01:22:54.04 --> 01:22:56.52
I'm like, this dude might live, man.

2290
01:22:56.52 --> 01:22:57.88
Like, whoa.

2291
01:22:57.88 --> 01:23:00.000
So, um, yeah, we protected a guy.

2292
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.12
He was a deputy vice president named Ibrahim al-Jafri.

2293
01:23:02.12 --> 01:23:08.12
He was a family physician at six kids, uh, fled Saddam, lived in Iran, went up in London.

2294
01:23:08.12 --> 01:23:17.92
And, um, it was, it was really, it was amazingly, uh, interesting to do that mission.

2295
01:23:17.92 --> 01:23:19.08
And all the bros are out down.

2296
01:23:19.08 --> 01:23:25.68
You guys are doing your gig, you know, and, um, I was essentially, I went to every place

2297
01:23:25.68 --> 01:23:31.16
in that country running protection for a guy that's running a political campaign during

2298
01:23:31.16 --> 01:23:33.36
a war where everybody wants to kill you.

2299
01:23:33.36 --> 01:23:34.36
Yeah.

2300
01:23:34.36 --> 01:23:35.36
I know.

2301
01:23:35.36 --> 01:23:36.36
It was a miracle.

2302
01:23:36.36 --> 01:23:37.36
Not just a miracle.

2303
01:23:37.36 --> 01:23:41.76
It was a great, great, awesome work by the guys to keep all those guys safe.

2304
01:23:41.76 --> 01:23:48.92
I mean, there was, everybody wanted all the, well, not everybody, but a big number of people

2305
01:23:48.92 --> 01:23:53.60
wanted to kill one or any one of those people.

2306
01:23:53.60 --> 01:23:57.28
And that leadership was kept alive for how long was that mission?

2307
01:23:57.28 --> 01:24:00.04
Cause you said I was out doing, I wasn't doing anything at that point.

2308
01:24:00.04 --> 01:24:05.28
I'd come back, you know, I really, you know, my timing was really, really good because

2309
01:24:05.28 --> 01:24:11.52
I was, went up to just DA's for my first deployment, which was just awesome.

2310
01:24:11.52 --> 01:24:14.92
As we left that mission came up.

2311
01:24:14.92 --> 01:24:16.52
And then when I came back, it was over.

2312
01:24:16.52 --> 01:24:20.96
So I had awesome timing as far as not having to do that mission.

2313
01:24:20.96 --> 01:24:25.20
It lasted through, I mean, I came back after the elections.

2314
01:24:25.20 --> 01:24:28.000
So again, the forest comp thing, remember everybody's fingers?

2315
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000
Yeah.

2316
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.000
All right.

2317
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.20
So there's a picture of this guy who became the first democratic elected prime minister

2318
01:24:32.20 --> 01:24:33.60
in Iraq's history.

2319
01:24:33.60 --> 01:24:34.60
Right.

2320
01:24:34.60 --> 01:24:36.48
And then there's a picture of him with his finger up there.

2321
01:24:36.48 --> 01:24:42.04
I'm standing directly behind the camera that took that picture because I was responsible

2322
01:24:42.04 --> 01:24:44.52
for his security.

2323
01:24:44.52 --> 01:24:46.16
So back to Chris, man.

2324
01:24:46.16 --> 01:24:50.48
So he's coming in and Bliff is there and we're rotating out, right?

2325
01:24:50.48 --> 01:24:52.80
And two really funny things happened with him.

2326
01:24:52.80 --> 01:24:54.80
One it's a prestige thing.

2327
01:24:54.80 --> 01:24:59.40
So wait, so he's coming in with team seven or who's he coming in with?

2328
01:24:59.40 --> 01:25:00.40
Your team five must have been.

2329
01:25:00.40 --> 01:25:01.40
Yeah.

2330
01:25:01.40 --> 01:25:02.40
I don't know who it was.

2331
01:25:02.40 --> 01:25:07.44
It was Chief and cool and bliff was is I see, you know, and so two funny things happen.

2332
01:25:07.44 --> 01:25:15.12
There's a cultural thing in some Arabic countries, Iraq being one where you want to be as close

2333
01:25:15.12 --> 01:25:16.60
to the center of power as possible.

2334
01:25:16.60 --> 01:25:18.92
I guess that's here in the United States too.

2335
01:25:18.92 --> 01:25:24.16
But so we would run these motor kids, right?

2336
01:25:24.16 --> 01:25:25.52
Lead limo file.

2337
01:25:25.52 --> 01:25:30.06
And then you'd have elements ahead of you and then behind you.

2338
01:25:30.06 --> 01:25:33.84
So if anything happened, you can skedaddle and these guys get in the gunfight.

2339
01:25:33.84 --> 01:25:35.80
So you're protecting the principal.

2340
01:25:35.80 --> 01:25:37.68
And I talked to these guys over and over again.

2341
01:25:37.68 --> 01:25:40.64
I'm like, look, you're very important people.

2342
01:25:40.64 --> 01:25:41.64
I get that.

2343
01:25:41.64 --> 01:25:46.84
You know, you're the minister of whatever the heck, but our sole function is to make

2344
01:25:46.84 --> 01:25:48.32
sure that echo lives.

2345
01:25:48.32 --> 01:25:49.92
You know what I mean?

2346
01:25:49.92 --> 01:25:55.08
We're going to help you with everyone medical, but that will not be to the detriment of making

2347
01:25:55.08 --> 01:25:56.48
sure that echoes a lot.

2348
01:25:56.48 --> 01:25:57.48
Check.

2349
01:25:57.48 --> 01:26:03.92
We always try to weasel into this convoy and these guys had one of those beautiful Mercedes

2350
01:26:03.92 --> 01:26:05.32
bands like the powder blue.

2351
01:26:05.32 --> 01:26:08.36
You know, I'm talking to the big just awesome.

2352
01:26:08.36 --> 01:26:10.08
And the guy's name was Adnan Phil.

2353
01:26:10.08 --> 01:26:12.68
He was his security chief.

2354
01:26:12.68 --> 01:26:18.96
Phil Phil is Arabic for pepper because he had a real hot temper, you know, and Chris

2355
01:26:18.96 --> 01:26:25.28
is in the car with and we're sitting there, you know, blazing through Baghdad and looking

2356
01:26:25.28 --> 01:26:26.28
them here.

2357
01:26:26.28 --> 01:26:31.16
And it's interesting when you're in combat, you get to that point where you see everything.

2358
01:26:31.16 --> 01:26:32.72
Do you know what I mean?

2359
01:26:32.72 --> 01:26:37.68
Like things are happening over here and you have a full holistic understanding of your

2360
01:26:37.68 --> 01:26:38.80
environment.

2361
01:26:38.80 --> 01:26:43.24
And that's really why I think people miss being in that, you know, in combat because

2362
01:26:43.24 --> 01:26:45.16
you are completely alive.

2363
01:26:45.16 --> 01:26:49.84
Anyway, so I'm talking to them like, Oh my gosh, I want to suck this guy's weasel behind

2364
01:26:49.84 --> 01:26:51.40
us in this powder blue Mercedes.

2365
01:26:51.40 --> 01:26:52.76
It's on that Phil Phil.

2366
01:26:52.76 --> 01:26:59.32
So I just opened up my door like this, this up armor, and I point my M4 back at them.

2367
01:26:59.32 --> 01:27:00.96
I mean, clearly, I'm not going to shoot him.

2368
01:27:00.96 --> 01:27:03.04
But I point my M4 at him.

2369
01:27:03.04 --> 01:27:07.48
He's like, it goes back to the back of the line of this, you know, huge motor game.

2370
01:27:07.48 --> 01:27:09.48
And Chris was like, what just happened?

2371
01:27:09.48 --> 01:27:11.48
He actually used some of the expletives.

2372
01:27:11.48 --> 01:27:14.92
And I'm like, I'm trying to tell you, these people are going to keep doing that.

2373
01:27:14.92 --> 01:27:16.36
They're on our side.

2374
01:27:16.36 --> 01:27:22.36
But it's very important that they understand the ground rules that are being set here.

2375
01:27:22.36 --> 01:27:23.88
And that's going to happen over and over again.

2376
01:27:23.88 --> 01:27:27.04
Chris, doesn't matter how hard you try, they're going to keep doing this.

2377
01:27:27.04 --> 01:27:32.76
And then the other thing was funny, we're down at, do you remember who Tarek Aziz was?

2378
01:27:32.76 --> 01:27:33.88
I remember that name.

2379
01:27:33.88 --> 01:27:36.96
Saddam Hussein's foreign minister, the guy with the big sunglasses.

2380
01:27:36.96 --> 01:27:42.96
Okay, so his house was taken over by a guy named Abdul Aziz Hakim, who was part of the

2381
01:27:42.96 --> 01:27:48.60
Dawa party and was right by the, you exited the green zone, went over the 14th July branch

2382
01:27:48.60 --> 01:27:50.12
and it's like right there.

2383
01:27:50.12 --> 01:27:51.92
So that's where all these meetings are taking place.

2384
01:27:51.92 --> 01:27:53.32
So we had to go down there.

2385
01:27:53.32 --> 01:27:55.64
They only take the AIC, which is the agent in charge.

2386
01:27:55.64 --> 01:27:58.000
It was the renamed OIC.

2387
01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000
They take him inside.

2388
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000
They didn't want anybody else there.

2389
01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.04
So we've got all these cars around.

2390
01:28:02.04 --> 01:28:07.84
And I have my car and my body armor's in there, my helmets in there, my rifles in there, and

2391
01:28:07.84 --> 01:28:09.68
I have a pistol.

2392
01:28:09.68 --> 01:28:12.76
And we'd set up everywhere and you'd be there for hours and hours and hours.

2393
01:28:12.76 --> 01:28:13.76
So I'd go around checking everybody.

2394
01:28:13.76 --> 01:28:15.64
It was good to go.

2395
01:28:15.64 --> 01:28:20.32
I'm in Chris and Bliss car.

2396
01:28:20.32 --> 01:28:26.68
And I'm like, okay, so if we have an indirect attack, mortar, artillery, whatever, you just

2397
01:28:26.68 --> 01:28:30.20
got to wait a minute and see if it develops into a complex attack.

2398
01:28:30.20 --> 01:28:35.36
Meaning, so they mortar stuff and then they can use that to make everybody go to ground

2399
01:28:35.36 --> 01:28:39.68
and then they can start infiltrating, you know, with ground troops.

2400
01:28:39.68 --> 01:28:45.28
So I go, so if that happens and you just wait a sec and then you punch out a primary immediately

2401
01:28:45.28 --> 01:28:46.80
so that no one can infiltrate your lines.

2402
01:28:46.80 --> 01:28:49.60
And you got to just, you got to do it like boom, this happens.

2403
01:28:49.60 --> 01:28:54.60
So and I open up the door, I hop out and boom, like right over there.

2404
01:28:54.60 --> 01:28:55.60
Huge explosion.

2405
01:28:55.60 --> 01:28:56.60
I go just like this.

2406
01:28:56.60 --> 01:28:57.60
And I sit back in the car.

2407
01:28:57.60 --> 01:28:59.60
Seriously, I said just like this and I sit back in the car.

2408
01:28:59.60 --> 01:29:00.60
Wait a minute.

2409
01:29:00.60 --> 01:29:01.60
Okay, go.

2410
01:29:01.60 --> 01:29:03.000
And then I realized I don't have a rifle.

2411
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.24
I have my pistol.

2412
01:29:04.24 --> 01:29:09.44
So you remember that little, the green army man, the medic running with the pistol.

2413
01:29:09.44 --> 01:29:12.92
So I'm running in Baghdad with the pistol.

2414
01:29:12.92 --> 01:29:15.36
I started, wait, where was your freaking weapon, bro?

2415
01:29:15.36 --> 01:29:21.36
It was in my vehicle, which was right next to theirs, like right there.

2416
01:29:21.36 --> 01:29:24.16
Oh, so you went over to tell them what to do.

2417
01:29:24.16 --> 01:29:27.92
I was going in, I was briefing them about how to handle different attack scenarios.

2418
01:29:27.92 --> 01:29:29.20
In that one time you did.

2419
01:29:29.20 --> 01:29:31.80
The one time, you know, that happens.

2420
01:29:31.80 --> 01:29:32.80
That's freaking awful.

2421
01:29:32.80 --> 01:29:36.40
And so I'm like, you know, running to a perimeter with the pistol in my hand.

2422
01:29:36.40 --> 01:29:40.80
I start chuckling because I'm like, I just look absurd at this point, but I'm a very

2423
01:29:40.80 --> 01:29:42.52
good pistol shop, by the way.

2424
01:29:42.52 --> 01:29:46.20
And what, what it turned out, that ain't going to cut it, bro.

2425
01:29:46.20 --> 01:29:48.20
No, seriously.

2426
01:29:48.20 --> 01:29:49.20
I know.

2427
01:29:49.20 --> 01:29:54.84
Hey, listen, I think we should discuss things, words and all, you know, but what happened

2428
01:29:54.84 --> 01:29:59.20
was the Iraqi police had had an AD with an RPG.

2429
01:29:59.20 --> 01:30:05.000
So that was not an impact that was an outgoing, but they had that moon dust out there.

2430
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.36
You know, so you couldn't tell it looked like a mortar around coming.

2431
01:30:07.36 --> 01:30:12.04
It didn't sound like a mortar around, but it looked like one because the impact.

2432
01:30:12.04 --> 01:30:15.16
So that's my funny seal story.

2433
01:30:15.16 --> 01:30:18.28
What did you learn from a leadership perspective on that deployment?

2434
01:30:18.28 --> 01:30:23.04
That's a tough deployment from a different angle because you got guys that are pissed

2435
01:30:23.04 --> 01:30:30.72
to be doing this job, but it's a very, it's a strategic mission to keep these guys alive.

2436
01:30:30.72 --> 01:30:32.76
I learned, well, I didn't really learn it.

2437
01:30:32.76 --> 01:30:35.60
It's just reinforced some things for me.

2438
01:30:35.60 --> 01:30:40.000
The mission always comes first, no matter what.

2439
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.40
And the missions America.

2440
01:30:41.40 --> 01:30:45.32
It's not some this woke bullshit that these military officers are coming up with now.

2441
01:30:45.32 --> 01:30:48.44
Sorry for swearing, but that, that ain't the mission dude.

2442
01:30:48.44 --> 01:30:53.32
The mission's America and that's got to happen every day.

2443
01:30:53.32 --> 01:30:57.04
That's why, you know, my fat bald person, I'm running for Congress now because the mission

2444
01:30:57.04 --> 01:31:00.72
is America and America is being failed by our leadership.

2445
01:31:00.72 --> 01:31:02.08
Anyway, side note.

2446
01:31:02.08 --> 01:31:03.88
So mission comes first.

2447
01:31:03.88 --> 01:31:09.60
And then I also learned to let some things roll.

2448
01:31:09.60 --> 01:31:11.04
And this is why.

2449
01:31:11.04 --> 01:31:12.04
We were late.

2450
01:31:12.04 --> 01:31:17.08
So the doctor lived in the Coticea, which was like a neighborhood right outside of checkpoint

2451
01:31:17.08 --> 01:31:18.08
11.

2452
01:31:18.08 --> 01:31:20.92
So checkpoint 11 went from the green zone to route Irish where everybody's getting killed

2453
01:31:20.92 --> 01:31:21.92
all the time.

2454
01:31:21.92 --> 01:31:24.24
You had to drive down a mile or so, whatever.

2455
01:31:24.24 --> 01:31:27.80
But no left into the Coticea to pick this guy up.

2456
01:31:27.80 --> 01:31:29.36
And so we were late.

2457
01:31:29.36 --> 01:31:33.72
I'm like, you know, frick, frack, frack, brr, you know, being a sealed sailor guy.

2458
01:31:33.72 --> 01:31:36.08
We're living in Udey Hussein's, one of his joints.

2459
01:31:36.08 --> 01:31:38.92
I think it was gray wolf was the father there.

2460
01:31:38.92 --> 01:31:47.04
Anyway, so we're late and then boom, just massive, massive car bomb goes off right at

2461
01:31:47.04 --> 01:31:48.04
checkpoint 11.

2462
01:31:48.04 --> 01:31:54.12
Like it was so big it blew a car like 50 feet up on top of a tree.

2463
01:31:54.12 --> 01:31:56.28
And here's what happened.

2464
01:31:56.28 --> 01:32:01.64
They knew we were going to the Coticea and this they had this huge bomb and the traffic

2465
01:32:01.64 --> 01:32:04.28
keeps going forward and forward and forward and forward.

2466
01:32:04.28 --> 01:32:07.96
It finally gets to the checkpoint and they clack themselves off.

2467
01:32:07.96 --> 01:32:12.36
We were supposed to be in that line passing and would have killed the entire platoon

2468
01:32:12.36 --> 01:32:15.48
except for the one guy we had working on the job.

2469
01:32:15.48 --> 01:32:17.12
So that was a real lesson.

2470
01:32:17.12 --> 01:32:21.12
Yeah, should you strive to be on time?

2471
01:32:21.12 --> 01:32:22.12
Sure.

2472
01:32:22.12 --> 01:32:28.60
But you need to make sure that if things are going a little hinky, try to figure out why.

2473
01:32:28.60 --> 01:32:34.84
I used to have, you know, my thing was my joke was, but it wasn't a joke, but it kind

2474
01:32:34.84 --> 01:32:37.24
of was, you know, you have no go criteria.

2475
01:32:37.24 --> 01:32:38.24
Yeah.

2476
01:32:38.24 --> 01:32:39.80
Hey, we don't have the aircraft cover we want.

2477
01:32:39.80 --> 01:32:42.28
That's no go or we don't have enough vehicles.

2478
01:32:42.28 --> 01:32:44.60
And I used to joke, but I would serious.

2479
01:32:44.60 --> 01:32:49.84
I'd be like, no, it's we have in my task, we have go, go criteria, which is we're going

2480
01:32:49.84 --> 01:32:50.84
and we don't have aircraft.

2481
01:32:50.84 --> 01:32:53.24
We'll call tanks.

2482
01:32:53.24 --> 01:32:57.76
But occasionally, even with that attitude, I'd be like, well, okay, we don't have this.

2483
01:32:57.76 --> 01:32:58.76
We don't have that.

2484
01:32:58.76 --> 01:33:00.40
We, you know, this isn't working out.

2485
01:33:00.40 --> 01:33:04.84
We haven't talked to these people and I'd be like the universe is conspiring against

2486
01:33:04.84 --> 01:33:06.84
this operation and we're not going to do it.

2487
01:33:06.84 --> 01:33:11.56
So it's just like a gut feeling where I'd like, I can, there's, I'll cover obstacle,

2488
01:33:11.56 --> 01:33:15.96
obstacle, obstacle, obstacle, no factor, no factor, no factor, no factor, no factor.

2489
01:33:15.96 --> 01:33:19.28
This, this is, this is, we're not doing this.

2490
01:33:19.28 --> 01:33:21.40
Well that's a function of maturity.

2491
01:33:21.40 --> 01:33:23.16
It really is.

2492
01:33:23.16 --> 01:33:26.76
And sometimes you just look at things and you're like non-starter.

2493
01:33:26.76 --> 01:33:27.76
Yeah.

2494
01:33:27.76 --> 01:33:28.76
Yeah.

2495
01:33:28.76 --> 01:33:30.08
And that's okay.

2496
01:33:30.08 --> 01:33:34.84
So you get done with this deployment.

2497
01:33:34.84 --> 01:33:35.84
In Iraq.

2498
01:33:35.84 --> 01:33:36.76
In Iraq.

2499
01:33:36.76 --> 01:33:37.76
And what's your next move?

2500
01:33:37.76 --> 01:33:39.48
So that's your platoon chief deployment.

2501
01:33:39.48 --> 01:33:41.08
You get done with that deployment.

2502
01:33:41.08 --> 01:33:42.08
What's your next move?

2503
01:33:42.08 --> 01:33:45.80
I came back and I'm a plank owner at what was known as the support activities.

2504
01:33:45.80 --> 01:33:47.20
Support activities.

2505
01:33:47.20 --> 01:33:53.60
So you're going there and the support activity basic mission is to gather intelligence.

2506
01:33:53.60 --> 01:33:54.60
Yeah.

2507
01:33:54.60 --> 01:33:56.92
It's like a combination of all the ints.

2508
01:33:56.92 --> 01:34:00.16
And you know, I just had an act for that too.

2509
01:34:00.16 --> 01:34:05.96
So I was one of the first five guys, you know, sitting around trying to figure this out.

2510
01:34:05.96 --> 01:34:08.000
Bob Newsom was the first skipper.

2511
01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.000
He's retired cap nine.

2512
01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.40
Worked for the 76ers doing some stuff.

2513
01:34:11.40 --> 01:34:12.40
No idea.

2514
01:34:12.40 --> 01:34:13.40
Yeah.

2515
01:34:13.40 --> 01:34:21.52
But um, yeah, that was a very, very rewarding time to build something else up from the ground

2516
01:34:21.52 --> 01:34:27.44
because I only built or helped build, you know, this is not clearly, this is all a team

2517
01:34:27.44 --> 01:34:33.88
effort, but help build the special connoisseurs and warfare part of trade at.

2518
01:34:33.88 --> 01:34:39.04
And then doing that, it's like the whole team, which was, which was fascinating.

2519
01:34:39.04 --> 01:34:42.56
And then I did some deployments from that that are not really a topic for discussion.

2520
01:34:42.56 --> 01:34:43.56
Right.

2521
01:34:43.56 --> 01:34:45.56
And how, but how long did you spend there?

2522
01:34:45.56 --> 01:34:47.80
Oh my gosh.

2523
01:34:47.80 --> 01:34:48.80
Like three years.

2524
01:34:48.80 --> 01:34:50.88
It couldn't have been that long actually.

2525
01:34:50.88 --> 01:34:57.92
Well I came back from Iraq and then that was, would have been 2005 or six.

2526
01:34:57.92 --> 01:35:01.72
I think I left there in 2008 ish.

2527
01:35:01.72 --> 01:35:03.72
It's like two or three years.

2528
01:35:03.72 --> 01:35:08.16
I went to special operations command Europe after that.

2529
01:35:08.16 --> 01:35:10.68
After that, but then you go to seven first.

2530
01:35:10.68 --> 01:35:12.48
So, yeah, sorry.

2531
01:35:12.48 --> 01:35:15.72
Cause you, cause I know that's when you and I really, that's when you and I crossed that.

2532
01:35:15.72 --> 01:35:20.32
I think we'd met each other along the way at some point, but we, I didn't actually say

2533
01:35:20.32 --> 01:35:22.32
one, right.

2534
01:35:22.32 --> 01:35:27.28
Until I was at trade at, and you were at team seven.

2535
01:35:27.28 --> 01:35:28.84
So I went from, you're right.

2536
01:35:28.84 --> 01:35:32.08
It was sport activity team seven special operations command Europe.

2537
01:35:32.08 --> 01:35:34.52
And then I retired out of since you'll swig.

2538
01:35:34.52 --> 01:35:35.52
So okay.

2539
01:35:35.52 --> 01:35:42.48
So you do, you're doing working with the ints and by what you mean by that is human intelligence,

2540
01:35:42.48 --> 01:35:45.64
signal intelligence, all that kind of intelligence gathering.

2541
01:35:45.64 --> 01:35:47.48
We'll say you did that for a few years.

2542
01:35:47.48 --> 01:35:50.28
I'm not going to talk about that here.

2543
01:35:50.28 --> 01:35:53.60
And then you go, what third, you want to see something called keep talking.

2544
01:35:53.60 --> 01:35:54.60
Okay.

2545
01:35:54.60 --> 01:35:55.60
Well, you're breaking stuff up.

2546
01:35:55.60 --> 01:35:56.60
I'll show you.

2547
01:35:56.60 --> 01:35:58.40
I want to show you one of the coolest pictures ever.

2548
01:35:58.40 --> 01:35:59.92
Oh, okay.

2549
01:35:59.92 --> 01:36:05.64
Because this was on my last deployment for Afghanistan.

2550
01:36:05.64 --> 01:36:09.000
Check that one out.

2551
01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:14.56
That's a winner.

2552
01:36:14.56 --> 01:36:18.52
That picture is taken about three or four months after the boat scene on active valor

2553
01:36:18.52 --> 01:36:20.000
was filmed.

2554
01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.64
The boat scene on active hours filmed.

2555
01:36:22.64 --> 01:36:24.80
So active hours, a movie with a bunch of seals in it.

2556
01:36:24.80 --> 01:36:25.80
Right.

2557
01:36:25.80 --> 01:36:26.88
I'm in the movie.

2558
01:36:26.88 --> 01:36:27.88
When was that filmed?

2559
01:36:27.88 --> 01:36:28.88
Gosh, it was.

2560
01:36:28.88 --> 01:36:31.20
That wasn't that wasn't until later.

2561
01:36:31.20 --> 01:36:36.12
It came out in 2012 or something, but that it took like three years to film that movie

2562
01:36:36.12 --> 01:36:41.08
because everybody except for the officer in the film deployed to combat during the filming

2563
01:36:41.08 --> 01:36:42.08
of that movie.

2564
01:36:42.08 --> 01:36:43.40
What happens if someone gets killed?

2565
01:36:43.40 --> 01:36:44.40
It's going to wreck the movie.

2566
01:36:44.40 --> 01:36:47.56
You're like, well, thanks deeply appreciate your caring about us.

2567
01:36:47.56 --> 01:36:50.16
You're going to have to rewrite a script that will take you eight minutes because there

2568
01:36:50.16 --> 01:36:52.000
was no script.

2569
01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.88
Yeah, that was, uh, I think it came out 2012.

2570
01:36:55.88 --> 01:37:00.84
So they started filming that in 2009 ish because I was, that was, I was working up to go to

2571
01:37:00.84 --> 01:37:02.64
Afghanistan when that was filmed.

2572
01:37:02.64 --> 01:37:05.04
And that got, so here's what happened with that movie.

2573
01:37:05.04 --> 01:37:06.88
Let's, let's talk to seal team seven first.

2574
01:37:06.88 --> 01:37:07.88
Okay.

2575
01:37:07.88 --> 01:37:08.88
So you, this is a team seven.

2576
01:37:08.88 --> 01:37:09.88
Right.

2577
01:37:09.88 --> 01:37:10.88
So yeah.

2578
01:37:10.88 --> 01:37:11.88
So check this out.

2579
01:37:11.88 --> 01:37:13.68
So I am a troop chief at team seven.

2580
01:37:13.68 --> 01:37:19.44
And then the super specialized mission came along that I had done previously and I'm the

2581
01:37:19.44 --> 01:37:21.60
only one at the team that has done this.

2582
01:37:21.60 --> 01:37:24.52
And I'm the only one with the qualifications while there's two other guys with the same

2583
01:37:24.52 --> 01:37:27.40
qualifications as me, but I'm the only one that has actually done this mission working

2584
01:37:27.40 --> 01:37:30.52
for this other subset of people doing this stuff.

2585
01:37:30.52 --> 01:37:32.72
So the skipper's like, I don't know what I'm doing.

2586
01:37:32.72 --> 01:37:34.36
I mean, God bless him.

2587
01:37:34.36 --> 01:37:35.36
He had no idea.

2588
01:37:35.36 --> 01:37:39.52
He goes, you can pick anybody you want from the team and take him to go do this.

2589
01:37:39.52 --> 01:37:43.32
So me and the guy who I won't mention is actually right next to me in that picture because he's

2590
01:37:43.32 --> 01:37:45.28
still after duty.

2591
01:37:45.28 --> 01:37:47.56
We went through everybody's records at team seven.

2592
01:37:47.56 --> 01:37:51.52
I'm like, you know, this guy, this guy, this guy, this guy, and then we need comms guys

2593
01:37:51.52 --> 01:37:52.52
and all these other folks.

2594
01:37:52.52 --> 01:37:56.64
So we put together this little group of folks to deploy to Afghanistan to do this super

2595
01:37:56.64 --> 01:37:57.92
specialized mission.

2596
01:37:57.92 --> 01:37:59.04
That was at team seven.

2597
01:37:59.04 --> 01:38:01.20
So I went from being a troop chief.

2598
01:38:01.20 --> 01:38:06.76
We had 56 or 60 years after that was after you did your troop chief.

2599
01:38:06.76 --> 01:38:09.52
That was my troop chief deployment.

2600
01:38:09.52 --> 01:38:13.000
So we sent guys to Balad.

2601
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.56
Iraq was not happening.

2602
01:38:14.56 --> 01:38:18.28
They're wearing starch uniforms and they have no magazines in their guns.

2603
01:38:18.28 --> 01:38:19.80
The Walker and saluting people in Iraq.

2604
01:38:19.80 --> 01:38:22.12
I don't want any part of that.

2605
01:38:22.12 --> 01:38:28.44
And then there was a small group that went to Afghanistan to get reattached to the CG

2606
01:38:28.44 --> 01:38:31.76
Soda for the first time since Red Wings happened.

2607
01:38:31.76 --> 01:38:34.72
And then I took another group of guys over here.

2608
01:38:34.72 --> 01:38:38.36
So my guys got farmed to Balad to do nothing.

2609
01:38:38.36 --> 01:38:41.56
A small group of them that's declassified now to Yemen.

2610
01:38:41.56 --> 01:38:45.84
And then we went to Afghanistan to do this other subset.

2611
01:38:45.84 --> 01:38:50.60
So we didn't have a traditional, you know, task unit, go out and, you know, like bruiser.

2612
01:38:50.60 --> 01:38:52.44
We didn't, it just wasn't available.

2613
01:38:52.44 --> 01:38:53.44
Yeah.

2614
01:38:53.44 --> 01:38:54.44
It just wasn't happening.

2615
01:38:54.44 --> 01:38:55.44
No, it wasn't.

2616
01:38:55.44 --> 01:38:56.44
So I went and did that.

2617
01:38:56.44 --> 01:38:57.44
How'd you like being a troop chief?

2618
01:38:57.44 --> 01:39:00.84
You know what?

2619
01:39:00.84 --> 01:39:08.96
It was interesting, but it's not, it's not, it wasn't like his hands on.

2620
01:39:08.96 --> 01:39:14.08
The logistics part was, you know, it was more difficult to get done.

2621
01:39:14.08 --> 01:39:20.20
And then you're managing personalities.

2622
01:39:20.20 --> 01:39:23.64
You know, I could, I would prefer to do this.

2623
01:39:23.64 --> 01:39:24.64
Yeah.

2624
01:39:24.64 --> 01:39:29.80
I mean, I guess if your, your troop gets all split up, yeah, I mean, if we had a traditional

2625
01:39:29.80 --> 01:39:35.12
true or traditional, you know, air quotations, you know, 0506 Iraq or if we could do like

2626
01:39:35.12 --> 01:39:44.76
03 Afghanistan, where you are seriously getting it, that would have been much different.

2627
01:39:44.76 --> 01:39:50.24
But in effect, you know, I had guys, like one of my guys, I'll give you an example of

2628
01:39:50.24 --> 01:39:54.40
why, one of my guys, I think I had six seals with me.

2629
01:39:54.40 --> 01:39:58.52
So going from like 60 seals to six, but they're all like, you know what?

2630
01:39:58.52 --> 01:40:04.80
We were doing that, like driving around in thin skin vehicles by ourselves during the

2631
01:40:04.80 --> 01:40:07.52
day in Afghanistan.

2632
01:40:07.52 --> 01:40:09.96
And your QRF is not coming.

2633
01:40:09.96 --> 01:40:15.08
So the level of stress that is applied, I mean, it's so much easier.

2634
01:40:15.08 --> 01:40:19.72
And you know this to go with 50 dudes and lock something down and go in and just, you know,

2635
01:40:19.72 --> 01:40:21.44
do seal stuff.

2636
01:40:21.44 --> 01:40:22.44
And that's great.

2637
01:40:22.44 --> 01:40:25.48
And it, you know, we get a lot of, it's very stressful.

2638
01:40:25.48 --> 01:40:27.20
That's really stressful.

2639
01:40:27.20 --> 01:40:31.04
When you got to plan these things in detail, intricate, and if you make one mistake, it's

2640
01:40:31.04 --> 01:40:32.04
over.

2641
01:40:32.04 --> 01:40:35.60
And I did that for several years.

2642
01:40:35.60 --> 01:40:39.12
I mean, it's upper division warfare is what I call it.

2643
01:40:39.12 --> 01:40:40.12
Upper division warfare.

2644
01:40:40.12 --> 01:40:41.12
Yeah, it is totally.

2645
01:40:41.12 --> 01:40:47.000
Because you have to have a holistic understanding of all the thresholds going from the Elanthi

2646
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:51.76
electronic warfare perspective all the way down to how do I shoot my gun?

2647
01:40:51.76 --> 01:40:56.04
Way different than, you know, go that way.

2648
01:40:56.04 --> 01:41:05.28
So when you build this picture, you have, you have like a global perspective, but for

2649
01:41:05.28 --> 01:41:08.16
a local area.

2650
01:41:08.16 --> 01:41:12.72
And you understand you have all these triggers that if they start getting pinged, you got

2651
01:41:12.72 --> 01:41:13.72
to bail.

2652
01:41:13.72 --> 01:41:17.92
And sometimes you intentionally trigger them.

2653
01:41:17.92 --> 01:41:20.20
So yeah, interesting.

2654
01:41:20.20 --> 01:41:23.08
So that was troop to troop chief thing.

2655
01:41:23.08 --> 01:41:26.32
In a way it was not as exciting as it should have been.

2656
01:41:26.32 --> 01:41:28.24
But again, that's the first place.

2657
01:41:28.24 --> 01:41:32.68
Like I said, that's the first time that I like remember you PIDing like, oh yeah, that's

2658
01:41:32.68 --> 01:41:35.52
because you know, I'd seen you around and you were an essay, whatever.

2659
01:41:35.52 --> 01:41:37.40
But that's the first time I remember you.

2660
01:41:37.40 --> 01:41:44.28
Like we were out at desert training and like meeting you and hanging out and running the

2661
01:41:44.28 --> 01:41:49.12
FTX's and all that stuff, having good times.

2662
01:41:49.12 --> 01:41:57.28
Carrying some, you were carrying some, you know, some wounded men out there, which seems

2663
01:41:57.28 --> 01:42:01.12
to have left a mark on some people emotionally at this juncture.

2664
01:42:01.12 --> 01:42:03.28
I was a little bit crazy when it came back.

2665
01:42:03.28 --> 01:42:04.28
So.

2666
01:42:04.28 --> 01:42:05.28
All right, man.

2667
01:42:05.28 --> 01:42:06.28
Hey, listen, I got it.

2668
01:42:06.28 --> 01:42:07.28
I'll tell you something.

2669
01:42:07.28 --> 01:42:09.96
I remember your, your viewers understands.

2670
01:42:09.96 --> 01:42:14.72
I remember when you came back and you went around the teams and you gave a brief that

2671
01:42:14.72 --> 01:42:16.68
you called the pressure.

2672
01:42:16.68 --> 01:42:17.68
Remember that?

2673
01:42:17.68 --> 01:42:18.68
Yeah.

2674
01:42:18.68 --> 01:42:19.68
The pressure.

2675
01:42:19.68 --> 01:42:21.68
And at that point, because I didn't know you either.

2676
01:42:21.68 --> 01:42:22.68
You know what I mean?

2677
01:42:22.68 --> 01:42:28.36
You got some dude, bad haircut, probably lifts too many weights and drinks, energy drinks,

2678
01:42:28.36 --> 01:42:29.36
you know, whatever.

2679
01:42:29.36 --> 01:42:31.000
It's a total diamond doesn't seal.

2680
01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.20
This is just to be honest.

2681
01:42:32.20 --> 01:42:35.28
It's good to be the diamond in the rough.

2682
01:42:35.28 --> 01:42:40.20
But you gave this brief and it was, you called it the pressure and it was, what you're doing

2683
01:42:40.20 --> 01:42:41.20
is you're conveying.

2684
01:42:41.20 --> 01:42:42.80
I mean, this is my perspective.

2685
01:42:42.80 --> 01:42:45.20
Obviously you wrote it.

2686
01:42:45.20 --> 01:42:51.84
Conveying the burden of leadership and the fact that you truly at that point got it, which

2687
01:42:51.84 --> 01:42:55.24
is a lot of officers never get it.

2688
01:42:55.24 --> 01:42:58.40
And I was watching you and I thought you were much younger than me at the time.

2689
01:42:58.40 --> 01:42:59.40
I don't know.

2690
01:42:59.40 --> 01:43:00.68
But I was like, this guy gets it.

2691
01:43:00.68 --> 01:43:08.16
Like he understands ramifications of poor decision making and things are real.

2692
01:43:08.16 --> 01:43:14.16
And it just doesn't affect, you know, your reputation as I'm a great operator, you know,

2693
01:43:14.16 --> 01:43:19.32
that it affects families and that it affects the nation.

2694
01:43:19.32 --> 01:43:20.32
And I understood that.

2695
01:43:20.32 --> 01:43:21.56
That's when I really got a respect for you.

2696
01:43:21.56 --> 01:43:25.52
When listening to you see that, because I could see your heart was breaking when you're discussing

2697
01:43:25.52 --> 01:43:28.12
this and that you weren't making anything up.

2698
01:43:28.12 --> 01:43:32.56
Being very genuine about leadership is really important and we're missing that, dude.

2699
01:43:32.56 --> 01:43:37.52
We're missing that from the tactical, strategic and operational level throughout our country

2700
01:43:37.52 --> 01:43:41.48
and private industry and the government, especially it's terrible.

2701
01:43:41.48 --> 01:43:43.92
So now you guys know.

2702
01:43:43.92 --> 01:43:49.60
Yeah, I haven't given that brief in a long time.

2703
01:43:49.60 --> 01:43:57.16
And I remember thinking about it and, you know, I'm thinking about the experiences that

2704
01:43:57.16 --> 01:44:04.12
I had, you know, when we deployed in Tasking a Bruiser, you know, we hadn't lost any guys

2705
01:44:04.12 --> 01:44:06.56
on the West Coast yet.

2706
01:44:06.56 --> 01:44:11.08
And you know, even looking into, you know, we were just talking about the work up and

2707
01:44:11.08 --> 01:44:17.08
you're going through the work up and like a down man was like a theoretical thing, a

2708
01:44:17.08 --> 01:44:20.12
problem solving event that you're going to get and you're going to go through it.

2709
01:44:20.12 --> 01:44:24.64
And OK, now that person gets, you know, you're back to life at the end of that training mission.

2710
01:44:24.64 --> 01:44:28.08
And obviously that's not the reality of the situation.

2711
01:44:28.08 --> 01:44:29.08
Correct.

2712
01:44:29.08 --> 01:44:31.84
And trying to make sure to convey that to the guys.

2713
01:44:31.84 --> 01:44:37.28
And that's, you know, when I got done with that deployment, you know, the admiral who

2714
01:44:37.28 --> 01:44:40.20
I knew was like, where do you want to go?

2715
01:44:40.20 --> 01:44:45.08
And I 100% just said I want to go to trade at, I want to go to trade at and run training.

2716
01:44:45.08 --> 01:44:49.04
And the reason is because first of all, all the guys in my task in it were all going to

2717
01:44:49.04 --> 01:44:52.20
go right back into another platoon.

2718
01:44:52.20 --> 01:44:55.68
And they were all going to go right back overseas into that meat grinder.

2719
01:44:55.68 --> 01:44:58.76
And it didn't look like, you know, this was in 2006 when we got home, it was still, you

2720
01:44:58.76 --> 01:45:01.20
couldn't tell when it was going to stop.

2721
01:45:01.20 --> 01:45:03.92
It just looked like it was going to go on indefinitely.

2722
01:45:03.92 --> 01:45:10.28
We saw some indications that looking in hindsight, you could see that, oh, that was an indication

2723
01:45:10.28 --> 01:45:11.36
that things were going to settle down.

2724
01:45:11.36 --> 01:45:14.92
But you couldn't positively identify them at the time coming home from deployment.

2725
01:45:14.92 --> 01:45:16.44
I was like, no, this is going to last.

2726
01:45:16.44 --> 01:45:18.88
We're going to have to do this in all these other cities.

2727
01:45:18.88 --> 01:45:19.88
It's just going to continue.

2728
01:45:19.88 --> 01:45:23.52
And everyone's going back to this meat grinder, and I want to make sure that I can convey

2729
01:45:23.52 --> 01:45:27.36
these lessons to the guys that are going to go back over there and get in it.

2730
01:45:27.36 --> 01:45:31.000
And that's where that came from.

2731
01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:35.88
So you went to trade at for the same reasons I did, but six years later.

2732
01:45:35.88 --> 01:45:36.88
Yeah.

2733
01:45:36.88 --> 01:45:37.88
Yeah.

2734
01:45:37.88 --> 01:45:41.84
It was to pass on those lessons and get things headed in the right direction.

2735
01:45:41.84 --> 01:45:44.56
Increase combat survivability of SEALs.

2736
01:45:44.56 --> 01:45:45.56
100%.

2737
01:45:45.56 --> 01:45:51.48
And that's why we're out at Nyland or we're out at the urban training sites.

2738
01:45:51.48 --> 01:45:57.76
And it was like, I remember feeling I'd see a guy in an urban environment standing in

2739
01:45:57.76 --> 01:46:03.20
the middle of the street, and I would literally have a sick to my stomach knot when I'd see

2740
01:46:03.20 --> 01:46:04.20
a guy standing in the open.

2741
01:46:04.20 --> 01:46:05.76
This is in training.

2742
01:46:05.76 --> 01:46:11.04
And I'd get over to be like, go find cover because you're waiting for the guy to get

2743
01:46:11.04 --> 01:46:12.04
shot.

2744
01:46:12.04 --> 01:46:13.80
That's a horrible feeling.

2745
01:46:13.80 --> 01:46:18.96
And doing the best to pass those lessons on that's, you know, that was the goal.

2746
01:46:18.96 --> 01:46:20.24
Yeah.

2747
01:46:20.24 --> 01:46:22.44
That should be everybody's goal.

2748
01:46:22.44 --> 01:46:30.16
It's I when you take that and you transition into civilian life.

2749
01:46:30.16 --> 01:46:33.08
I tell people a couple of things frequently.

2750
01:46:33.08 --> 01:46:36.80
It is the minimum responsibility of every American citizen to pass on to their children

2751
01:46:36.80 --> 01:46:44.60
or country where they have at a minimum the same ability to choose to have options.

2752
01:46:44.60 --> 01:46:48.12
And we're failing at that as a society collectively.

2753
01:46:48.12 --> 01:46:56.44
If you think about what the government did to the population during this COVID crap,

2754
01:46:56.44 --> 01:46:59.08
you can't deny there's five elements to the First Amendment.

2755
01:46:59.08 --> 01:47:03.24
There's freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly

2756
01:47:03.24 --> 01:47:07.80
and freedom to seek a regress redress for grievances.

2757
01:47:07.80 --> 01:47:10.76
All of those are smashed in the ground during COVID.

2758
01:47:10.76 --> 01:47:13.44
So it's our responsibility to make sure that doesn't happen again.

2759
01:47:13.44 --> 01:47:14.44
How do we do that?

2760
01:47:14.44 --> 01:47:16.72
We take the imperative knowledge from what we went through these last two years and we

2761
01:47:16.72 --> 01:47:21.12
apply that innacadly, meaning we don't try to read into it.

2762
01:47:21.12 --> 01:47:24.12
We just look at it and say what it is and the government now is trying to hide everything.

2763
01:47:24.12 --> 01:47:25.52
They're trying to do everything back.

2764
01:47:25.52 --> 01:47:27.36
Yeah, which is one of the worst things possible.

2765
01:47:27.36 --> 01:47:31.80
When you make a mistake, you know, you go, hey, look, I'm in a state here.

2766
01:47:31.80 --> 01:47:36.28
And this was horrible during the whole thing because, hey, if you think that this thing

2767
01:47:36.28 --> 01:47:41.32
spreads this way and you look up three months later and that turns out to not be true, you

2768
01:47:41.32 --> 01:47:43.12
say, hey, listen, I made a mistake here.

2769
01:47:43.12 --> 01:47:44.12
We thought it was this.

2770
01:47:44.12 --> 01:47:45.12
It was that.

2771
01:47:45.12 --> 01:47:46.12
Here's the adjustment.

2772
01:47:46.12 --> 01:47:49.08
You know, I would send you out on operation and say, hey, you know, I want you to hit

2773
01:47:49.08 --> 01:47:52.96
this target from the north and you go, okay, okay, boss sounds good.

2774
01:47:52.96 --> 01:47:56.72
And you hit a couple IEDs on the way in and you go, hey, Jocko, there's IEDs here.

2775
01:47:56.72 --> 01:47:59.44
I don't go, well, you just keep going where I told you to go.

2776
01:47:59.44 --> 01:48:03.000
No, I say, hey, look, I made a mistake on the analysis of the scenario.

2777
01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Back out.

2778
01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Let's figure out a better way.

2779
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.32
No factor.

2780
01:48:06.32 --> 01:48:09.96
And by the way, you're not, you don't lose respect for me.

2781
01:48:09.96 --> 01:48:13.64
You go, oh, well, Jocko was willing to admit that he made a mistake of the analysis of this

2782
01:48:13.64 --> 01:48:15.28
and learned from it and learned from it.

2783
01:48:15.28 --> 01:48:19.76
And now we're going to make some adjustments and to see the egos come out where there's

2784
01:48:19.76 --> 01:48:24.84
no admission that, hey, you know what, I actually, I made a bad assessment here.

2785
01:48:24.84 --> 01:48:25.84
It was wrong.

2786
01:48:25.84 --> 01:48:29.08
And here's the adjustment we need to make as far as I can tell right now.

2787
01:48:29.08 --> 01:48:32.76
And by the way, there's a decent chance we'll be wrong again, which also is why I'm not

2788
01:48:32.76 --> 01:48:36.24
over committing and overstating things.

2789
01:48:36.24 --> 01:48:41.52
You know, I always have fun when I work with companies and I'll say, how often do you,

2790
01:48:41.52 --> 01:48:44.84
you know, how often do you people think I have to admit that I'm wrong?

2791
01:48:44.84 --> 01:48:48.000
And people think, oh, you know, because I talk about being humble and they go, oh, you admit

2792
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000
that you're wrong all the time.

2793
01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.16
And I go, no, I hardly ever have to admit that I'm wrong.

2794
01:48:51.16 --> 01:48:53.76
And the reason I hardly ever have to admit that I'm wrong is because I hardly ever say,

2795
01:48:53.76 --> 01:48:57.000
I'm 100% right about this thing.

2796
01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.88
This is how we should do this mission or this is what this means or this is how you should

2797
01:49:00.88 --> 01:49:01.88
interpret this.

2798
01:49:01.88 --> 01:49:05.16
No, I say, hey, this is what it looks like from my perspective.

2799
01:49:05.16 --> 01:49:07.84
Let's take a small step and see what we learn.

2800
01:49:07.84 --> 01:49:13.000
So I agree with it mostly there, but it's to me, it's not, this is how I think we should

2801
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:14.000
do this.

2802
01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000
That's okay.

2803
01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.32
When people, and this was one of the things that we had to break when we were writing

2804
01:49:19.32 --> 01:49:26.48
all that curriculum for SR and Lane warfare, this is how this is done.

2805
01:49:26.48 --> 01:49:33.84
When you say to somebody, this is how this is done, you're over because this is how this

2806
01:49:33.84 --> 01:49:38.68
was done at this time in this place with this series of variables.

2807
01:49:38.68 --> 01:49:39.68
Yeah.

2808
01:49:39.68 --> 01:49:44.24
Well, so you actually agree with what I said, because what I said is, well, what I'm saying

2809
01:49:44.24 --> 01:49:47.72
is, hey, this is what I think we should do right now.

2810
01:49:47.72 --> 01:49:49.32
Not this is what we should do.

2811
01:49:49.32 --> 01:49:50.32
Yes.

2812
01:49:50.32 --> 01:49:51.72
This is what I think we should do right now.

2813
01:49:51.72 --> 01:49:55.08
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is, this is not what, okay, there's a difference.

2814
01:49:55.08 --> 01:49:59.52
So this is what we should do is different than this is how this is done.

2815
01:49:59.52 --> 01:50:01.12
So this is what we should do.

2816
01:50:01.12 --> 01:50:05.96
Means that this is the way that I think at this particular time, this should be done

2817
01:50:05.96 --> 01:50:07.72
right because of these variables.

2818
01:50:07.72 --> 01:50:08.72
It's open.

2819
01:50:08.72 --> 01:50:09.72
It's open.

2820
01:50:09.72 --> 01:50:11.68
This is how this is done is closed is wrong.

2821
01:50:11.68 --> 01:50:12.68
Yeah.

2822
01:50:12.68 --> 01:50:14.08
Decision making is not taking place.

2823
01:50:14.08 --> 01:50:15.08
Yeah.

2824
01:50:15.08 --> 01:50:20.36
So that's why I hardly ever have to admit that I'm wrong because I hardly ever say, hey,

2825
01:50:20.36 --> 01:50:22.88
I'm 100% right about this thing right here.

2826
01:50:22.88 --> 01:50:24.64
No, you're not going to catch me saying that.

2827
01:50:24.64 --> 01:50:26.52
Because how often can you be accurate with that?

2828
01:50:26.52 --> 01:50:31.28
It's very, very seldom that you're going to be in a scenario where you know something

2829
01:50:31.28 --> 01:50:33.04
with 100% certainty.

2830
01:50:33.04 --> 01:50:34.92
It almost never happens.

2831
01:50:34.92 --> 01:50:42.16
And I would rather, even if I'm 99% certain, what do I gain out of imposing some directive

2832
01:50:42.16 --> 01:50:43.16
on you?

2833
01:50:43.16 --> 01:50:45.84
If you're working for me, what am I going to gain out of that?

2834
01:50:45.84 --> 01:50:46.84
You got your perspective.

2835
01:50:46.84 --> 01:50:49.12
There's a decent chance that you see something I don't see.

2836
01:50:49.12 --> 01:50:50.56
So my mind's open.

2837
01:50:50.56 --> 01:50:53.68
Hey, Derek, I think Mike, this might be a good way to do this op.

2838
01:50:53.68 --> 01:50:55.40
Then you go, well, I don't agree.

2839
01:50:55.40 --> 01:50:57.16
Okay, well, what do you think?

2840
01:50:57.16 --> 01:50:58.40
Let's talk.

2841
01:50:58.40 --> 01:51:03.88
And my gut, my bias is to go with what you say.

2842
01:51:03.88 --> 01:51:07.32
That is my bias is to, you come up with a way to do something.

2843
01:51:07.32 --> 01:51:09.92
It doesn't matter if I'm, here's the other interesting thing.

2844
01:51:09.92 --> 01:51:13.24
It doesn't matter if we're peers or I'm your boss or you're my boss.

2845
01:51:13.24 --> 01:51:15.76
My bias is to go with what you say.

2846
01:51:15.76 --> 01:51:22.000
Now look, if you're totally off the res and your idea is just ridiculous, well, it's

2847
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.12
very easy for me to articulate, Hey, Derek, I know you want to do this, you know, jumping

2848
01:51:26.12 --> 01:51:29.72
parachutes out of the space shuttle, but right, it's going to be really hard for us to get

2849
01:51:29.72 --> 01:51:33.20
the space shuttle for this operation in a short period of time.

2850
01:51:33.20 --> 01:51:34.76
So I thought you're wheeling heat.

2851
01:51:34.76 --> 01:51:36.20
Exactly.

2852
01:51:36.20 --> 01:51:37.76
It's very easy to articulate that.

2853
01:51:37.76 --> 01:51:43.20
But if I'm having a hard time articulating why I think something should be done a certain

2854
01:51:43.20 --> 01:51:47.28
way, then that's a big indicator that maybe it's not worth arguing.

2855
01:51:47.28 --> 01:51:50.32
And maybe it's just easier to say, Okay, you know what, Derek, let's let's let's roll

2856
01:51:50.32 --> 01:51:51.32
with your dice.

2857
01:51:51.32 --> 01:51:56.12
You're incapable of articulating appropriately the methodologies that you're applying to

2858
01:51:56.12 --> 01:51:57.12
a problem set.

2859
01:51:57.12 --> 01:51:58.96
You have not thought them through well enough.

2860
01:51:58.96 --> 01:51:59.96
Boom.

2861
01:51:59.96 --> 01:52:00.96
Yeah.

2862
01:52:00.96 --> 01:52:01.96
Someone taught a seal how to read.

2863
01:52:01.96 --> 01:52:02.96
What's up?

2864
01:52:02.96 --> 01:52:07.84
It's a real good indicator of that.

2865
01:52:07.84 --> 01:52:13.52
So you roll out on this deployment, you're doing some, what'd you say, higher level?

2866
01:52:13.52 --> 01:52:14.52
What'd you say?

2867
01:52:14.52 --> 01:52:21.28
What was your vision warfare division warfare running around without a ton of support.

2868
01:52:21.28 --> 01:52:22.28
Correct.

2869
01:52:22.28 --> 01:52:29.28
If any, and you get done with that deployment won't go into the details of that one.

2870
01:52:29.28 --> 01:52:30.44
You come back.

2871
01:52:30.44 --> 01:52:31.44
What's your next job?

2872
01:52:31.44 --> 01:52:36.32
Okay, I was going to go teach what I was doing because I believe you should do that.

2873
01:52:36.32 --> 01:52:37.32
Right.

2874
01:52:37.32 --> 01:52:38.32
Like we talked about that.

2875
01:52:38.32 --> 01:52:44.000
But then they came, so I was a senior chief at that point and the billet, the job was

2876
01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.64
for an E seven, not an E eight.

2877
01:52:46.64 --> 01:52:49.64
And that's when they went through and they said, Hey, look, you used to be able to do

2878
01:52:49.64 --> 01:52:50.80
one up, one down.

2879
01:52:50.80 --> 01:52:56.000
So the billet is for an E seven and E six could go do that or a E eight.

2880
01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Right.

2881
01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000
You could do one up, one down.

2882
01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000
They're like, no more of this.

2883
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.48
We don't have enough guys to do this stuff.

2884
01:53:00.48 --> 01:53:01.48
It's an E seven billet.

2885
01:53:01.48 --> 01:53:03.48
So I'm like, Oh man.

2886
01:53:03.48 --> 01:53:08.36
So I go check in is down at the elephant cage at advanced training and I was just kind of

2887
01:53:08.36 --> 01:53:12.80
sitting there and they're like, we got to find it E seven billet, you know, and there

2888
01:53:12.80 --> 01:53:16.40
was not because that's a platoon chief job and I just got done being a troop chief nerd,

2889
01:53:16.40 --> 01:53:17.40
you know.

2890
01:53:17.40 --> 01:53:21.76
And suddenly I go up to more calm, it's like a month into this and I feel like I'm stealing

2891
01:53:21.76 --> 01:53:24.48
money from the government because I go to check in.

2892
01:53:24.48 --> 01:53:25.88
We got nothing to do.

2893
01:53:25.88 --> 01:53:33.08
And so I go up to Pugs is the guy and Pugs, right?

2894
01:53:33.08 --> 01:53:37.48
So I'm like, Pugs, dude, I needed a job.

2895
01:53:37.48 --> 01:53:38.76
And he's like, well, I don't know.

2896
01:53:38.76 --> 01:53:43.88
So he pulls up the list of like all the seal billets on the planet, right?

2897
01:53:43.88 --> 01:53:50.32
And Bosnia, I flew through Germany, Stuttgart, Booblingen, on the way there and on the way

2898
01:53:50.32 --> 01:53:51.32
back.

2899
01:53:51.32 --> 01:53:58.24
And I'm like, and my wife, she did like a semester in Germany in college.

2900
01:53:58.24 --> 01:54:00.24
So I'm like, right there.

2901
01:54:00.24 --> 01:54:01.24
I want to go there.

2902
01:54:01.24 --> 01:54:02.52
He's like, okay.

2903
01:54:02.52 --> 01:54:05.48
So I get a billet.

2904
01:54:05.48 --> 01:54:09.76
I get a billet as the J three five, which is the contingency operations, NCIC at special

2905
01:54:09.76 --> 01:54:12.12
operations command Europe.

2906
01:54:12.12 --> 01:54:14.24
That's why I went up there.

2907
01:54:14.24 --> 01:54:15.24
Yeah.

2908
01:54:15.24 --> 01:54:17.08
And, you know, I have an act for this stuff.

2909
01:54:17.08 --> 01:54:18.72
The upper division warfare stuff applies.

2910
01:54:18.72 --> 01:54:27.40
I understand how to, you know, take very complex problem sets and distill them down into readily

2911
01:54:27.40 --> 01:54:29.48
available and achievable solutions.

2912
01:54:29.48 --> 01:54:32.08
Like it's just something I'm good at.

2913
01:54:32.08 --> 01:54:36.68
And so I wrote all the contingency of the soft response to contingency operations plans

2914
01:54:36.68 --> 01:54:38.60
for all the countries in Europe.

2915
01:54:38.60 --> 01:54:40.20
And then we developed further.

2916
01:54:40.20 --> 01:54:42.24
From them being executed right now, I'm sure.

2917
01:54:42.24 --> 01:54:43.24
Yeah.

2918
01:54:43.24 --> 01:54:47.84
The, um, convention warfare campaign plan for the Ukraine is one of them.

2919
01:54:47.84 --> 01:54:54.000
So at that time when I left in 2012, me and this other guy named Derek, who's a retired

2920
01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.08
special forces girl, we gave the Ukrainians a month.

2921
01:54:58.08 --> 01:55:03.56
Like so we were planning for a Russian invasion of the Ukraine in 2000.

2922
01:55:03.56 --> 01:55:05.24
That's 2009 10.

2923
01:55:05.24 --> 01:55:06.24
Right.

2924
01:55:06.24 --> 01:55:07.16
People think the military doesn't do stuff.

2925
01:55:07.16 --> 01:55:09.92
We do.

2926
01:55:09.92 --> 01:55:12.96
But we gave him a month because the authorities are different.

2927
01:55:12.96 --> 01:55:14.32
And what do you mean you gave him a month?

2928
01:55:14.32 --> 01:55:17.32
We thought within a month, the Russians would take over the entire country.

2929
01:55:17.32 --> 01:55:18.32
Oh, got it.

2930
01:55:18.32 --> 01:55:19.32
Like we gave him a month.

2931
01:55:19.32 --> 01:55:21.36
DoD, I think it was given him about a week.

2932
01:55:21.36 --> 01:55:25.24
But you know, intuitively, Derek had multiple combat tours as special forces officers.

2933
01:55:25.24 --> 01:55:29.04
It's the fantastic officer.

2934
01:55:29.04 --> 01:55:31.20
But we gave him a month because we knew it better.

2935
01:55:31.20 --> 01:55:36.44
And then they changed the authorities and this happened so you could give him javelins

2936
01:55:36.44 --> 01:55:42.20
and stingers also the weapons that are doing this.

2937
01:55:42.20 --> 01:55:48.12
The crux of the plan without getting real deep into it is disaggregated small unit operations

2938
01:55:48.12 --> 01:55:50.60
facilitated by high tech weapons.

2939
01:55:50.60 --> 01:55:51.60
That's it.

2940
01:55:51.60 --> 01:55:55.28
And then also you have external intelligence and all that stuff.

2941
01:55:55.28 --> 01:55:56.80
That's just taking place.

2942
01:55:56.80 --> 01:56:01.32
That truly was an amazing thing.

2943
01:56:01.32 --> 01:56:04.68
It was very intellectually stimulating to do that.

2944
01:56:04.68 --> 01:56:09.04
But you know, at that point, I broke my back and all this stuff and I can't carry a rocket

2945
01:56:09.04 --> 01:56:10.04
anymore.

2946
01:56:10.04 --> 01:56:14.92
And that's really why I got out of the teams is because I just couldn't do the job physically.

2947
01:56:14.92 --> 01:56:16.84
I didn't want to breath far of myself.

2948
01:56:16.84 --> 01:56:17.84
You know what I mean?

2949
01:56:17.84 --> 01:56:18.84
Which Brett should have just retired.

2950
01:56:18.84 --> 01:56:21.24
Dude, Green Bay, why'd you go to Minnesota with Brett?

2951
01:56:21.24 --> 01:56:22.24
I'm looking right into the camera.

2952
01:56:22.24 --> 01:56:25.08
Why did you do that?

2953
01:56:25.08 --> 01:56:33.20
So doing that really kept me engaged in what was taking place really at that point globally.

2954
01:56:33.20 --> 01:56:38.84
And so Benghazi went down when I was there and there was still a sock half was getting

2955
01:56:38.84 --> 01:56:42.08
stood up special operations command Africa.

2956
01:56:42.08 --> 01:56:45.96
And there was commanders in extremist force sharing agreement.

2957
01:56:45.96 --> 01:56:54.40
You know, so it was I was really very deeply involved in the aftermath of Benghazi and

2958
01:56:54.40 --> 01:56:59.32
everything the Clinton folks told you and Obama is a lie.

2959
01:56:59.32 --> 01:57:01.32
In terms of what?

2960
01:57:01.32 --> 01:57:03.52
That should not have happened.

2961
01:57:03.52 --> 01:57:08.28
And as it was happening, it should have been stopped and could have been stopped.

2962
01:57:08.28 --> 01:57:09.28
Right.

2963
01:57:09.28 --> 01:57:12.32
So I mean, background on that.

2964
01:57:12.32 --> 01:57:18.04
Jimmy Carter, who previously was the worst president in American history, only superseded

2965
01:57:18.04 --> 01:57:19.60
by the current one Joe Biden.

2966
01:57:19.60 --> 01:57:20.60
He is terrible.

2967
01:57:20.60 --> 01:57:21.60
He just is.

2968
01:57:21.60 --> 01:57:23.44
It's very difficult to watch.

2969
01:57:23.44 --> 01:57:24.44
It's terrible.

2970
01:57:24.44 --> 01:57:27.24
I mean, it's painful.

2971
01:57:27.24 --> 01:57:30.76
So Jimmy Carter did something called chief of mission authorities.

2972
01:57:30.76 --> 01:57:34.76
An American ambassador is real title is chief of mission.

2973
01:57:34.76 --> 01:57:37.76
So the chief of the diplomatic mission, that's the real title.

2974
01:57:37.76 --> 01:57:43.96
And Carter said, look, no military forces will go into a country without the approval

2975
01:57:43.96 --> 01:57:48.12
of the chief of mission unless it's a title 10 designated country.

2976
01:57:48.12 --> 01:57:50.64
Meaning the title 10 is the Department of Defense thing.

2977
01:57:50.64 --> 01:57:52.24
And we're like, hey, we're going to invade Iraq.

2978
01:57:52.24 --> 01:57:53.92
That becomes a title 10 deal.

2979
01:57:53.92 --> 01:57:58.04
The military can move troops back and forth into that country without going through the

2980
01:57:58.04 --> 01:57:59.04
State Department.

2981
01:57:59.04 --> 01:58:01.88
That was not the case for Libya.

2982
01:58:01.88 --> 01:58:04.32
I mean, it wasn't.

2983
01:58:04.32 --> 01:58:10.12
So the State Department has so Ambassador Stevens had to approve the troops that were

2984
01:58:10.12 --> 01:58:16.92
on their way to Benghazi had to approve them landing in the country, but he was dead.

2985
01:58:16.92 --> 01:58:20.04
And the State Department didn't answer the phone.

2986
01:58:20.04 --> 01:58:23.04
Tina Cade now was there along with Secretary Clinton.

2987
01:58:23.04 --> 01:58:24.04
She's ultimately responsible.

2988
01:58:24.04 --> 01:58:27.48
They just didn't answer the phone.

2989
01:58:27.48 --> 01:58:33.28
And birds were spinning up and there's a role.

2990
01:58:33.28 --> 01:58:37.76
If you look up Jackal Stone 12, I think, just Google it.

2991
01:58:37.76 --> 01:58:44.16
Jackal Stone is a special operations forces annual European exercise.

2992
01:58:44.16 --> 01:58:45.48
You probably did it if you're two.

2993
01:58:45.48 --> 01:58:46.48
Did you know?

2994
01:58:46.48 --> 01:58:47.48
Okay.

2995
01:58:47.48 --> 01:58:49.36
But I know, but I know what the exercises.

2996
01:58:49.36 --> 01:58:50.36
Okay.

2997
01:58:50.36 --> 01:58:51.88
So that was taking place in split Croatia.

2998
01:58:51.88 --> 01:58:54.80
And you know that the SIF is there and they have a full pack.

2999
01:58:54.80 --> 01:58:56.24
None of this is classified, by the way.

3000
01:58:56.24 --> 01:58:58.000
They have a full package.

3001
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:03.72
They've got shooters, they got comms, they got medical, they have resupply, you know,

3002
01:59:03.72 --> 01:59:04.72
water, everything.

3003
01:59:04.72 --> 01:59:06.48
That bird was going there.

3004
01:59:06.48 --> 01:59:09.44
Because that's why it's there.

3005
01:59:09.44 --> 01:59:14.000
In case something like that happens and the agreement between Sokhaf and Sokjir was in

3006
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.52
place because Sokhaf didn't have a SIF yet.

3007
01:59:16.52 --> 01:59:17.52
Yeah.

3008
01:59:17.52 --> 01:59:18.52
Yeah.

3009
01:59:18.52 --> 01:59:19.52
Right.

3010
01:59:19.52 --> 01:59:20.52
So but no answer the phone.

3011
01:59:20.52 --> 01:59:25.16
So you can't land that plane.

3012
01:59:25.16 --> 01:59:26.80
Ty Woods man, did you know Ty?

3013
01:59:26.80 --> 01:59:27.80
Yeah.

3014
01:59:27.80 --> 01:59:28.80
Okay.

3015
01:59:28.80 --> 01:59:29.80
He's a total friend of mine, man.

3016
01:59:29.80 --> 01:59:30.80
And I didn't know Glenn.

3017
01:59:30.80 --> 01:59:31.80
He was in my class.

3018
01:59:31.80 --> 01:59:32.80
He was in my bus class.

3019
01:59:32.80 --> 01:59:33.80
Ty Woods?

3020
01:59:33.80 --> 01:59:34.80
Yep.

3021
01:59:34.80 --> 01:59:35.80
Yep.

3022
01:59:35.80 --> 01:59:36.80
And he ended up getting rolled.

3023
01:59:36.80 --> 01:59:39.44
But you know, he spent, you know.

3024
01:59:39.44 --> 01:59:40.44
Right.

3025
01:59:40.44 --> 01:59:41.44
So shameful.

3026
01:59:41.44 --> 01:59:47.28
And that I truly, I mean, I knew it before because I'd seen it on a macro level, but

3027
01:59:47.28 --> 01:59:52.16
I hadn't really seen on a, excuse me, on a micro level.

3028
01:59:52.16 --> 01:59:57.000
I've seen it, but on a macro level, I hadn't seen really the hardcore ramifications of

3029
01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:58.80
incredibly poor decision making.

3030
01:59:58.80 --> 02:00:01.44
Other than the fact we invaded Iraq when we did.

3031
02:00:01.44 --> 02:00:04.84
I mean, that was a big thing.

3032
02:00:04.84 --> 02:00:10.56
But that really, really brought it home that you just can't do that.

3033
02:00:10.56 --> 02:00:15.44
You have to be, if you're in a position of leadership, your phone is on all the time.

3034
02:00:15.44 --> 02:00:16.44
Yeah.

3035
02:00:16.44 --> 02:00:19.20
Well, actually superior to that is when you're in a position of leadership, you set up decentralized

3036
02:00:19.20 --> 02:00:21.84
command where people can make decisions without having to run things all the way up

3037
02:00:21.84 --> 02:00:22.84
to the top.

3038
02:00:22.84 --> 02:00:23.84
Yeah.

3039
02:00:23.84 --> 02:00:24.84
That's what you do.

3040
02:00:24.84 --> 02:00:25.84
That's the, yeah.

3041
02:00:25.84 --> 02:00:29.84
I mean, that's, that's how things should function.

3042
02:00:29.84 --> 02:00:31.24
Great on that depressing note.

3043
02:00:31.24 --> 02:00:32.24
Yeah.

3044
02:00:32.24 --> 02:00:33.96
So, so this is what you're doing.

3045
02:00:33.96 --> 02:00:39.48
You get a really good look strategically at the world through this tour that you do

3046
02:00:39.48 --> 02:00:40.48
right at soccer.

3047
02:00:40.48 --> 02:00:44.28
You're in a J35 billet doing planning and contingency planning.

3048
02:00:44.28 --> 02:00:50.52
And that's just a great view to go from being a troop commander literally on the ground.

3049
02:00:50.52 --> 02:00:56.40
And then even as a troop commander being for this particular deployment at a more, even

3050
02:00:56.40 --> 02:00:59.92
more tackle level than a normal troop command, but true.

3051
02:00:59.92 --> 02:01:00.92
Correct.

3052
02:01:00.92 --> 02:01:02.92
But doing a strategic level mission.

3053
02:01:02.92 --> 02:01:03.92
Yes.

3054
02:01:03.92 --> 02:01:05.24
And then, but you're on the ground doing it.

3055
02:01:05.24 --> 02:01:06.24
Yeah.

3056
02:01:06.24 --> 02:01:07.24
That's the difference.

3057
02:01:07.24 --> 02:01:12.84
And then you get to go to a situation where you're seeing the strategic planning for these

3058
02:01:12.84 --> 02:01:13.84
things that take place in the future.

3059
02:01:13.84 --> 02:01:15.32
So there's a really good education for you.

3060
02:01:15.32 --> 02:01:17.32
It's tremendous.

3061
02:01:17.32 --> 02:01:19.24
And you do how many years over there?

3062
02:01:19.24 --> 02:01:20.72
Oh, I did three years there.

3063
02:01:20.72 --> 02:01:22.44
And how many kids do you got at this point?

3064
02:01:22.44 --> 02:01:23.44
Four.

3065
02:01:23.44 --> 02:01:25.44
Do you speak German at this point?

3066
02:01:25.44 --> 02:01:26.44
Nine.

3067
02:01:26.44 --> 02:01:29.44
Two of them graduated from high school there though.

3068
02:01:29.44 --> 02:01:30.44
Oh, okay.

3069
02:01:30.44 --> 02:01:31.44
But it's in American high school.

3070
02:01:31.44 --> 02:01:32.44
It's in American high school.

3071
02:01:32.44 --> 02:01:33.44
Yeah.

3072
02:01:33.44 --> 02:01:36.36
Yeah, I just, one of my buddies ran into a team guy and his kids are all speaking German

3073
02:01:36.36 --> 02:01:37.36
because he came back from there.

3074
02:01:37.36 --> 02:01:39.28
Oh, I probably put him in the local schools.

3075
02:01:39.28 --> 02:01:40.28
Which you can do.

3076
02:01:40.28 --> 02:01:41.28
Yeah.

3077
02:01:41.28 --> 02:01:42.28
Which I was not to.

3078
02:01:42.28 --> 02:01:43.28
Check.

3079
02:01:43.28 --> 02:01:44.28
You get done with that.

3080
02:01:44.28 --> 02:01:45.28
What's your next job after that?

3081
02:01:45.28 --> 02:01:47.16
Center for sealant, swick excellence.

3082
02:01:47.16 --> 02:01:49.16
Which is the schoolhouse?

3083
02:01:49.16 --> 02:01:55.84
No, that is the command that writes all the advancement exams for seals.

3084
02:01:55.84 --> 02:01:57.68
That writes the enlisted ladder.

3085
02:01:57.68 --> 02:02:02.04
People don't understand when you join the Navy, the Navy plans out a career for you

3086
02:02:02.04 --> 02:02:04.32
for 30 years.

3087
02:02:04.32 --> 02:02:08.12
So even though you think you're joining on a six year enlistment or eight years or whatever

3088
02:02:08.12 --> 02:02:12.48
it is, you know, active and reserve, the Navy has a plan for you and they palm, I don't

3089
02:02:12.48 --> 02:02:17.64
know what that stands for, but they budget for you being in the military for 30 years.

3090
02:02:17.64 --> 02:02:21.72
But what, at least the seal teams have done, I don't know if other communities do this,

3091
02:02:21.72 --> 02:02:23.72
but you backwards plan on that.

3092
02:02:23.72 --> 02:02:27.60
So by the time you're in E5, you've gone to this school, you've done this job E6,

3093
02:02:27.60 --> 02:02:32.16
7, 8, it goes all the way up, that's the ladder to make sure that everybody is hopefully on

3094
02:02:32.16 --> 02:02:36.56
par with their institutional knowledge.

3095
02:02:36.56 --> 02:02:40.44
So I did that and it was really fun writing the advancement exams because I'd call all

3096
02:02:40.44 --> 02:02:44.40
my buddies and be like, hey, will you go down to Florida with me for a week?

3097
02:02:44.40 --> 02:02:49.20
We'll get locked in a skiff, you know, a big safe and we'll go through the previous exams

3098
02:02:49.20 --> 02:02:53.80
and then we'll write new questions updating the TTPs and all of the things for the seal

3099
02:02:53.80 --> 02:02:57.68
teams then in order to get promoted, seals would have to take that.

3100
02:02:57.68 --> 02:02:58.68
So that was awesome too.

3101
02:02:58.68 --> 02:03:00.04
That's a way to get back to the community.

3102
02:03:00.04 --> 02:03:08.12
But I went there because I needed to like get my medical situation in order and it took

3103
02:03:08.12 --> 02:03:09.12
like a year and a half.

3104
02:03:09.12 --> 02:03:13.16
Because at this point you're just a beat up old frogman.

3105
02:03:13.16 --> 02:03:14.16
You know what I mean?

3106
02:03:14.16 --> 02:03:15.16
That's why I'm fat right now.

3107
02:03:15.16 --> 02:03:16.88
If I go PT right now I can't walk.

3108
02:03:16.88 --> 02:03:19.88
I mean I've got an anti-cat placard for my car.

3109
02:03:19.88 --> 02:03:20.88
Damn.

3110
02:03:20.88 --> 02:03:21.88
Yeah, damn.

3111
02:03:21.88 --> 02:03:25.52
So I mean my knees and hips and back and I got a ricochet in the face.

3112
02:03:25.52 --> 02:03:26.52
It was in training.

3113
02:03:26.52 --> 02:03:27.52
It counts for nothing.

3114
02:03:27.52 --> 02:03:31.48
I didn't even get a free dental appointment because of that.

3115
02:03:31.48 --> 02:03:38.84
So yeah, I went there to do dual purpose, get myself physically up to par, at least

3116
02:03:38.84 --> 02:03:41.24
documented appropriately.

3117
02:03:41.24 --> 02:03:45.000
So that when I retired, because anyone's going to retire, you know it would be less of a

3118
02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:46.000
burden.

3119
02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.20
So that's really what I did there.

3120
02:03:48.20 --> 02:03:54.000
And again, I've had the ability and the luck and I think I'm blessed man.

3121
02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:55.000
I mean I am.

3122
02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.08
I have a deep and abiding faith in God.

3123
02:03:57.08 --> 02:04:02.08
And I look back, you know all the way back to getting hit in the head with a shackle.

3124
02:04:02.08 --> 02:04:04.72
How that led to all this stuff.

3125
02:04:04.72 --> 02:04:05.72
You know?

3126
02:04:05.72 --> 02:04:11.08
There's, I am one of the luckiest human beings that has ever existed.

3127
02:04:11.08 --> 02:04:12.80
And I am so full of gratitude man.

3128
02:04:12.80 --> 02:04:17.000
I mean I just, I get up and I'm just full of gratitude.

3129
02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:23.44
And I wish that more people would understand the gifts that they've been given.

3130
02:04:23.44 --> 02:04:25.36
And understand they're a gift.

3131
02:04:25.36 --> 02:04:29.000
I talked to folks about the cavalry thing.

3132
02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.52
Like the cavalry's not coming over the hill.

3133
02:04:30.52 --> 02:04:36.40
I tell them like, look man, you're placed here at this time, you know with these people

3134
02:04:36.40 --> 02:04:38.80
in this circumstance by God.

3135
02:04:38.80 --> 02:04:44.04
Like you're put here for a reason and from my perspective what I'm doing now and the

3136
02:04:44.04 --> 02:04:49.36
people I'm speaking to, it's to save the greatest country that has ever existed in the history

3137
02:04:49.36 --> 02:04:51.68
of the world.

3138
02:04:51.68 --> 02:04:56.56
Like the United States of America is an exceptional nation and I don't tolerate anybody talking

3139
02:04:56.56 --> 02:04:57.56
crap about America.

3140
02:04:57.56 --> 02:04:58.56
It's not going to happen.

3141
02:04:58.56 --> 02:05:05.20
And these folks that I'm dealing with, like you were placed here by God for that to save

3142
02:05:05.20 --> 02:05:10.92
the United States of America and that's a gift and you got to accept the gift.

3143
02:05:10.92 --> 02:05:14.64
And oftentimes gifts, you get this.

3144
02:05:14.64 --> 02:05:19.12
Oftentimes gifts can be perceived as a burden.

3145
02:05:19.12 --> 02:05:22.28
You know the gift of leadership that the talk used to give the pressure.

3146
02:05:22.28 --> 02:05:26.48
You're in that place at that time with those people in that circumstance and these things

3147
02:05:26.48 --> 02:05:29.64
happen you're exercising the best judgment that you're capable of doing.

3148
02:05:29.64 --> 02:05:30.84
You have the best assets in the world.

3149
02:05:30.84 --> 02:05:35.64
You're certainly working with the finest human beings that have ever existed and contextually

3150
02:05:35.64 --> 02:05:39.76
in warfare for sure and then around the block you know.

3151
02:05:39.76 --> 02:05:45.16
You're there for a reason because you were given the gift to be able to exercise that

3152
02:05:45.16 --> 02:05:46.16
mission.

3153
02:05:46.16 --> 02:05:52.20
If you're capable of doing something and you don't act on it, you're not giving glory

3154
02:05:52.20 --> 02:05:54.28
to God.

3155
02:05:54.28 --> 02:05:56.52
You're giving the intellectual or physical ability to do things.

3156
02:05:56.52 --> 02:06:00.20
If you don't do them, you're falling short.

3157
02:06:00.20 --> 02:06:02.20
I believe that.

3158
02:06:02.20 --> 02:06:07.20
Other people need to understand that.

3159
02:06:07.20 --> 02:06:10.20
What was it that made you decide that you were going to retire?

3160
02:06:10.20 --> 02:06:13.000
You're at how many years was this?

3161
02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:16.04
That was I would say 24 I guess.

3162
02:06:16.04 --> 02:06:18.40
That's when you made the decision?

3163
02:06:18.40 --> 02:06:19.40
Yeah.

3164
02:06:19.40 --> 02:06:20.40
And I retired at 26.

3165
02:06:20.40 --> 02:06:22.32
And how many kids did you have that was four?

3166
02:06:22.32 --> 02:06:24.64
You were up to your four at this point.

3167
02:06:24.64 --> 02:06:25.64
Yeah.

3168
02:06:25.64 --> 02:06:29.60
I just I knew that I couldn't do the job to the level that it deserved.

3169
02:06:29.60 --> 02:06:34.20
Did you have a retirement plan what you're going to do when you retired?

3170
02:06:34.20 --> 02:06:35.20
No.

3171
02:06:35.20 --> 02:06:36.20
No man.

3172
02:06:36.20 --> 02:06:40.04
We had bought a farm in Wisconsin probably 10 years before that.

3173
02:06:40.04 --> 02:06:41.44
I wanted to go back to my farm.

3174
02:06:41.44 --> 02:06:43.08
Who is taking care of the farm?

3175
02:06:43.08 --> 02:06:44.08
My neighbors.

3176
02:06:44.08 --> 02:06:47.40
How many acres is the farm?

3177
02:06:47.40 --> 02:06:48.40
It was 80.

3178
02:06:48.40 --> 02:06:49.40
And what kind of farm is it?

3179
02:06:49.40 --> 02:06:50.40
Hey.

3180
02:06:50.40 --> 02:06:52.48
And we raised animals and all that stuff.

3181
02:06:52.48 --> 02:06:58.52
So I got out and I did this corporate leadership stuff with Larry for a couple of years.

3182
02:06:58.52 --> 02:07:00.000
I didn't stop working.

3183
02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:05.76
And I did that and then what corporate leadership where you are just helping corporations with

3184
02:07:05.76 --> 02:07:09.12
their leadership type thing and executive coaching certain things.

3185
02:07:09.12 --> 02:07:11.68
I mean, yeah, the stuff you do but not nearly at the same level.

3186
02:07:11.68 --> 02:07:16.52
I mean, you've taken it beyond, you know, and it wasn't interesting to me.

3187
02:07:16.52 --> 02:07:19.36
So I'm like, you know what, let's go back to the farm.

3188
02:07:19.36 --> 02:07:21.08
Where were you living when you were doing that?

3189
02:07:21.08 --> 02:07:24.44
That was we lived in Maple Grove, which is in Minnesota.

3190
02:07:24.44 --> 02:07:25.44
Okay.

3191
02:07:25.44 --> 02:07:27.84
So you moved to Minnesota after you retired?

3192
02:07:27.84 --> 02:07:34.28
Or like a year because we wanted our youngest son to be able to graduate from high school.

3193
02:07:34.28 --> 02:07:37.20
At that point, he had gone to four different high schools.

3194
02:07:37.20 --> 02:07:39.52
So we found a nice Christian Academy.

3195
02:07:39.52 --> 02:07:44.60
That's really why I did all that stuff so that he could have that period of time where

3196
02:07:44.60 --> 02:07:49.44
he could actually graduate from high school in a place that and where we lived is fantastic.

3197
02:07:49.44 --> 02:07:51.04
It was butternut Wisconsin.

3198
02:07:51.04 --> 02:07:56.04
It's a very small place and we just wanted him to be able to round out his education in

3199
02:07:56.04 --> 02:07:57.04
a Christian setting.

3200
02:07:57.04 --> 02:07:59.24
And that was not available there.

3201
02:07:59.24 --> 02:08:07.52
And then we went back to the farm and the cafe in town was called the butternut cafe.

3202
02:08:07.52 --> 02:08:09.76
Surprisingly enough.

3203
02:08:09.76 --> 02:08:12.08
But it failed.

3204
02:08:12.08 --> 02:08:16.64
So the owner of the building, the person running the cafe, it didn't work well.

3205
02:08:16.64 --> 02:08:18.96
So it closed.

3206
02:08:18.96 --> 02:08:25.52
There's 326 people in the village.

3207
02:08:25.52 --> 02:08:30.16
These people had they had taken care of our farm for like a decade.

3208
02:08:30.16 --> 02:08:35.24
I went to Afghanistan, Iraq, the Horn of Africa and the station in Germany for three years.

3209
02:08:35.24 --> 02:08:37.12
Nothing happened to that place.

3210
02:08:37.12 --> 02:08:39.56
Not a window broken of my neighbors.

3211
02:08:39.56 --> 02:08:43.56
Tom and Maria Schulke, they'd mow our front lawn is like an acre and they would not take

3212
02:08:43.56 --> 02:08:44.96
money for gas.

3213
02:08:44.96 --> 02:08:45.96
We are not your servants.

3214
02:08:45.96 --> 02:08:46.96
We're your neighbors.

3215
02:08:46.96 --> 02:08:51.36
I mean, that's what these that people think that Americans are like these.

3216
02:08:51.36 --> 02:08:55.04
The image of Americans, it's not Manhattan, dude.

3217
02:08:55.04 --> 02:08:56.04
That's it.

3218
02:08:56.04 --> 02:08:58.80
I mean, I live in America and people bend over backwards.

3219
02:08:58.80 --> 02:09:02.64
We have so much more in common with each other than differences and it's being exploited

3220
02:09:02.64 --> 02:09:07.36
by these folks that are trying to do, I think, horrible things for the country.

3221
02:09:07.36 --> 02:09:09.80
But that's really America where I live now in Perry D. Sheen.

3222
02:09:09.80 --> 02:09:11.40
It's America, you know.

3223
02:09:11.40 --> 02:09:14.48
So this place closes, the village takes a huge hit.

3224
02:09:14.48 --> 02:09:19.72
And I'm like, man, so I talked to Sergey and I'm like, let's get this going again.

3225
02:09:19.72 --> 02:09:24.48
So I bought the building from a bank, gutted it, put in new equipment.

3226
02:09:24.48 --> 02:09:29.56
I worked in a restaurant for like a year or something before I joined the Navy.

3227
02:09:29.56 --> 02:09:33.60
Sarah was a waitress for three months in high school.

3228
02:09:33.60 --> 02:09:35.32
But you know, I'm a quick study.

3229
02:09:35.32 --> 02:09:36.32
I love cooking.

3230
02:09:36.32 --> 02:09:37.32
I've cooked around the world.

3231
02:09:37.32 --> 02:09:38.32
You know, I did.

3232
02:09:38.32 --> 02:09:41.28
I've made bread on five continents, dude, like made bread from flour.

3233
02:09:41.28 --> 02:09:44.36
I haven't made bread on one.

3234
02:09:44.36 --> 02:09:46.68
It's cathartic.

3235
02:09:46.68 --> 02:09:51.92
So we got the cafe going again and then sold it to a local lady at my BFF.

3236
02:09:51.92 --> 02:09:53.16
Her name's Bobby Munoz.

3237
02:09:53.16 --> 02:09:54.56
She's awesome.

3238
02:09:54.56 --> 02:09:56.96
And you know, that's random.

3239
02:09:56.96 --> 02:10:01.76
So so many people talk about things.

3240
02:10:01.76 --> 02:10:03.08
And a lot of people have money in there.

3241
02:10:03.08 --> 02:10:04.08
They'll throw money at problems.

3242
02:10:04.08 --> 02:10:08.52
You know, the government tries to throw money at problems, right?

3243
02:10:08.52 --> 02:10:13.44
If you say you're going to do something, dude, and the most valuable gift you can give somebody

3244
02:10:13.44 --> 02:10:16.64
is your time.

3245
02:10:16.64 --> 02:10:19.12
You have a finite amount of time on this planet.

3246
02:10:19.12 --> 02:10:22.44
Now as a Christian, I believe that, you know, something beyond this, but a lot of people

3247
02:10:22.44 --> 02:10:23.44
don't.

3248
02:10:23.44 --> 02:10:26.32
You only have you only have so much time.

3249
02:10:26.32 --> 02:10:29.12
So if you really care about somebody, give me your time.

3250
02:10:29.12 --> 02:10:30.68
Sit down with them.

3251
02:10:30.68 --> 02:10:31.68
Give them time.

3252
02:10:31.68 --> 02:10:38.88
So we we gave two years of our time back to that village because they're so dear to us.

3253
02:10:38.88 --> 02:10:42.92
And you know, I walked away net neutral.

3254
02:10:42.92 --> 02:10:50.44
But the impact of showing people demonstrating to them that you truly care about them is

3255
02:10:50.44 --> 02:10:52.64
priceless.

3256
02:10:52.64 --> 02:10:54.64
You know what I mean?

3257
02:10:54.64 --> 02:10:56.12
Yeah, absolutely.

3258
02:10:56.12 --> 02:11:00.84
You build this business back up.

3259
02:11:00.84 --> 02:11:05.28
You sell the whole thing to your BFF, your BFF.

3260
02:11:05.28 --> 02:11:06.44
What's your BFF's name?

3261
02:11:06.44 --> 02:11:07.44
Bobby.

3262
02:11:07.44 --> 02:11:08.72
Bobby, but Bobby's a female.

3263
02:11:08.72 --> 02:11:09.72
Female.

3264
02:11:09.72 --> 02:11:10.72
Okay.

3265
02:11:10.72 --> 02:11:12.92
So Bobby's now running the business.

3266
02:11:12.92 --> 02:11:20.04
She has she had Jenny run that and Bobby started Bobbers on the lake.

3267
02:11:20.04 --> 02:11:22.16
She wanted to go buy a beer.

3268
02:11:22.16 --> 02:11:23.16
Okay.

3269
02:11:23.16 --> 02:11:25.32
Well, this is important to put out because people are going to want to hit these places.

3270
02:11:25.32 --> 02:11:26.32
Yeah.

3271
02:11:26.32 --> 02:11:27.32
Bobbers, Bobbers on the lake.

3272
02:11:27.32 --> 02:11:29.96
It's in Butternut, Wisconsin from by Bobby.

3273
02:11:29.96 --> 02:11:32.04
I actually want to go to both these places.

3274
02:11:32.04 --> 02:11:33.68
And I don't even drink beer.

3275
02:11:33.68 --> 02:11:34.68
So right.

3276
02:11:34.68 --> 02:11:38.56
Bobby is a whirling dervish.

3277
02:11:38.56 --> 02:11:40.84
I mean, she is on the go.

3278
02:11:40.84 --> 02:11:43.72
I mean, you have all these different, you know, archipelago, adventure.

3279
02:11:43.72 --> 02:11:44.72
She's got the same thing going.

3280
02:11:44.72 --> 02:11:46.72
I mean, she's just.

3281
02:11:46.72 --> 02:11:47.72
Okay.

3282
02:11:47.72 --> 02:11:50.60
So you sell that business and now you move back to the farm?

3283
02:11:50.60 --> 02:11:52.16
No, I'm living on the farm.

3284
02:11:52.16 --> 02:11:53.16
Okay.

3285
02:11:53.16 --> 02:11:55.68
You're living on the farm and then I'm turning 50.

3286
02:11:55.68 --> 02:11:59.16
So this was three years ago.

3287
02:11:59.16 --> 02:12:04.40
And I'm like, this, this is another point in my life where you can either, you know,

3288
02:12:04.40 --> 02:12:12.92
kind of like just stay stagnant or you should do something to keep yourself rolling.

3289
02:12:12.92 --> 02:12:13.92
Right.

3290
02:12:13.92 --> 02:12:18.60
So I'm like, I'm going to go to law school and just like Bud's man, you can't just go

3291
02:12:18.60 --> 02:12:19.60
to law school.

3292
02:12:19.60 --> 02:12:20.76
Why can't I just go to law school?

3293
02:12:20.76 --> 02:12:21.76
Right.

3294
02:12:21.76 --> 02:12:25.92
So I studied for the LSAT for a month on the Khan Academy, which is awesome.

3295
02:12:25.92 --> 02:12:26.92
It's free.

3296
02:12:26.92 --> 02:12:30.40
You know, and took it and I got accepted to law school.

3297
02:12:30.40 --> 02:12:32.44
Mitchell Hamlin in St. Paul.

3298
02:12:32.44 --> 02:12:37.44
But during, so during this period of time, we did what we call cousin camp.

3299
02:12:37.44 --> 02:12:39.64
So we got all the cousins.

3300
02:12:39.64 --> 02:12:42.68
So, you know, our, my brother-in-law's and all the kids.

3301
02:12:42.68 --> 02:12:44.44
We got 570 people.

3302
02:12:44.44 --> 02:12:52.40
We get them all together and they were given Sarah, excuse me, hard time about how difficult

3303
02:12:52.40 --> 02:12:54.16
it was to exit this point.

3304
02:12:54.16 --> 02:12:59.60
We had four grandkids, I think, and we're having, yeah, we had, we were having, we had

3305
02:12:59.60 --> 02:13:02.48
three, we're having our fourth, fifth and sixth grandkids.

3306
02:13:02.48 --> 02:13:05.52
They're going to be born in a two month window.

3307
02:13:05.52 --> 02:13:12.32
And so they're giving Sarah Jane a hard time about how difficult it was to visit our farm

3308
02:13:12.32 --> 02:13:13.32
way up north.

3309
02:13:13.32 --> 02:13:17.32
And it was like an hour and 45 minutes to the closest regional airport.

3310
02:13:17.32 --> 02:13:20.24
And then if you're flying to there, it's an extra 200 bucks a person.

3311
02:13:20.24 --> 02:13:21.24
You know, I'm not a wealthy guy.

3312
02:13:21.24 --> 02:13:22.76
We live on our enlisted retirement.

3313
02:13:22.76 --> 02:13:24.24
I can't afford that stuff.

3314
02:13:24.24 --> 02:13:27.60
And, or you'd find a Minneapolis and it's like a four and a half hour drive.

3315
02:13:27.60 --> 02:13:29.12
So I'm like, check, got it.

3316
02:13:29.12 --> 02:13:30.32
I missed the kids growing up.

3317
02:13:30.32 --> 02:13:34.82
I did, you know, I was working, deployed, training, all that stuff.

3318
02:13:34.82 --> 02:13:39.16
So I set preconditions, two of them.

3319
02:13:39.16 --> 02:13:43.60
Well, I love that place up there, it took us 15 years to get the house, you know, up

3320
02:13:43.60 --> 02:13:46.16
to, it was just perfect.

3321
02:13:46.16 --> 02:13:49.16
And I'm like, two conditions.

3322
02:13:49.16 --> 02:13:51.76
Wait, the family wants you to move.

3323
02:13:51.76 --> 02:13:56.72
My wife wants us to go someplace closer to an airport so that our grandkids can visit

3324
02:13:56.72 --> 02:13:58.28
us and we can visit them more regularly.

3325
02:13:58.28 --> 02:13:59.28
Right.

3326
02:13:59.28 --> 02:14:04.12
And I'd missed our kids growing up because I was a frogman, natural environment combat.

3327
02:14:04.12 --> 02:14:11.68
So I was two conditions, it has to be in Wisconsin and it has to be a hobby farm.

3328
02:14:11.68 --> 02:14:17.04
So I get on the old internet in the kitchen, the farm, I find this place in Hager City,

3329
02:14:17.04 --> 02:14:22.04
which I did a one hour circumference around the airport, same part got it.

3330
02:14:22.04 --> 02:14:23.04
Right.

3331
02:14:23.04 --> 02:14:25.24
And it had to be on what I call the right side of the river.

3332
02:14:25.24 --> 02:14:29.64
That's politically and geographically correct.

3333
02:14:29.64 --> 02:14:34.56
And so I find this place in Hager City, I call them, it's going on the market the next

3334
02:14:34.56 --> 02:14:39.88
day, small hobby farm, old farmhouse, 19 acres, 13 tillable, alfalfa, not hay anymore.

3335
02:14:39.88 --> 02:14:40.88
Like check.

3336
02:14:40.88 --> 02:14:44.96
I drive down the next day, I look at it, I go, okay, this is it.

3337
02:14:44.96 --> 02:14:47.64
Put in an offer by the house, move down there.

3338
02:14:47.64 --> 02:14:49.96
Did you sell the other place?

3339
02:14:49.96 --> 02:14:52.48
We sold it after a couple months.

3340
02:14:52.48 --> 02:14:53.68
So it's gone.

3341
02:14:53.68 --> 02:14:55.72
And excuse me.

3342
02:14:55.72 --> 02:15:04.80
So interestingly enough, this is how I wound up running for Congress because Sean Duffy,

3343
02:15:04.80 --> 02:15:10.64
who was my rep for the longest time, if you look at Wisconsin, the Ashland County is like

3344
02:15:10.64 --> 02:15:13.48
right in the middle to the top, right?

3345
02:15:13.48 --> 02:15:15.76
And it's right next to Lake Superior.

3346
02:15:15.76 --> 02:15:20.56
Just past Glidden, which is the next village up from Butternut, it becomes very liberal

3347
02:15:20.56 --> 02:15:27.32
because there's a environmentalist liberal arts college here, North, Northland's College,

3348
02:15:27.32 --> 02:15:28.32
right?

3349
02:15:28.32 --> 02:15:31.56
So Sean and his crew would stop in Butternut.

3350
02:15:31.56 --> 02:15:32.56
And he's a U.S. Congressman.

3351
02:15:32.56 --> 02:15:35.76
Now he's on Fox all the time with Rachel, Capitol stuff.

3352
02:15:35.76 --> 02:15:37.84
Great couple, nine kids.

3353
02:15:37.84 --> 02:15:42.08
But so they would stop in our village and I'd cook for him and his staff.

3354
02:15:42.08 --> 02:15:45.40
So if something was coming up, it'd be like, oh, I'll just call Sean and ask him what's

3355
02:15:45.40 --> 02:15:47.08
going on, you know?

3356
02:15:47.08 --> 02:15:52.48
And so I moved down and that's in Pierce County, right?

3357
02:15:52.48 --> 02:15:55.68
Which is in the third congressional district, not the seventh congressional district.

3358
02:15:55.68 --> 02:15:56.88
I don't know any of this stuff.

3359
02:15:56.88 --> 02:15:59.04
I never tracked politics or anything, right?

3360
02:15:59.04 --> 02:16:01.80
So I'm like, oh, this impeachment was coming on.

3361
02:16:01.80 --> 02:16:05.000
I did human intelligence for a very long period of time.

3362
02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:09.76
I read the Steele dossier and I knew it was absolute junk.

3363
02:16:09.76 --> 02:16:11.04
This is manufactured.

3364
02:16:11.04 --> 02:16:12.48
This is not true.

3365
02:16:12.48 --> 02:16:16.64
It was submitted by a guy who was a former British intelligence officer that was clearly

3366
02:16:16.64 --> 02:16:21.12
colluding with Russian intelligence officers to produce this thing and it's paid for by

3367
02:16:21.12 --> 02:16:22.12
who?

3368
02:16:22.12 --> 02:16:23.12
No.

3369
02:16:23.12 --> 02:16:24.12
I knew it was junk, right?

3370
02:16:24.12 --> 02:16:25.12
So I'm like, who's my congressman?

3371
02:16:25.12 --> 02:16:27.12
You know, because it's not Sean anymore.

3372
02:16:27.12 --> 02:16:35.68
I'm like, whoa, hey, Ron kind, what's your stance on the impeachment of Donald Trump for

3373
02:16:35.68 --> 02:16:37.56
the Russian collusion stuff?

3374
02:16:37.56 --> 02:16:39.40
Didn't write me back.

3375
02:16:39.40 --> 02:16:40.40
Nothing crickets chirping.

3376
02:16:40.40 --> 02:16:43.24
And I'm like, what?

3377
02:16:43.24 --> 02:16:46.56
Dude, the job title is representative.

3378
02:16:46.56 --> 02:16:47.56
It's not your lordship.

3379
02:16:47.56 --> 02:16:48.56
You know what I mean?

3380
02:16:48.56 --> 02:16:52.40
This is not how a representative democracy is supposed to function and it sure didn't

3381
02:16:52.40 --> 02:16:54.04
with Sean.

3382
02:16:54.04 --> 02:16:58.36
So I'm getting steamed and I start looking into this cat, right?

3383
02:16:58.36 --> 02:17:02.32
I mean, finding terrorists in Pakistan is super hard.

3384
02:17:02.32 --> 02:17:03.56
You know what I mean?

3385
02:17:03.56 --> 02:17:04.92
It's very difficult.

3386
02:17:04.92 --> 02:17:09.56
It is not difficult finding out what politicians are doing.

3387
02:17:09.56 --> 02:17:13.84
So I started looking at this guy from the perspective of doing human intelligence and

3388
02:17:13.84 --> 02:17:15.80
finding out what this cat had been doing.

3389
02:17:15.80 --> 02:17:19.84
He'd been in office for 20, two or 23 years at the time.

3390
02:17:19.84 --> 02:17:24.24
Saying stuff in the district, you can find it in newspaper articles and interviews.

3391
02:17:24.24 --> 02:17:27.12
And then I'd compare that to his actual voting record.

3392
02:17:27.12 --> 02:17:29.56
And he was just wrong.

3393
02:17:29.56 --> 02:17:34.84
He would say one thing, go to DC and do another thing because he was working for the behest

3394
02:17:34.84 --> 02:17:39.56
of special interest groups, not the people he's representing, right?

3395
02:17:39.56 --> 02:17:43.12
So the impeachment vote goes down.

3396
02:17:43.12 --> 02:17:49.80
He is number 435 out of 435 representatives to cast his vote, made public on the floor

3397
02:17:49.80 --> 02:17:50.80
because he had to.

3398
02:17:50.80 --> 02:17:53.52
He told everybody in the district he wasn't going to vote for that impeachment because

3399
02:17:53.52 --> 02:17:54.52
it was junk.

3400
02:17:54.52 --> 02:17:56.04
I'm not doing that.

3401
02:17:56.04 --> 02:17:59.24
Well, he did it hoping to slide it under the radar.

3402
02:17:59.24 --> 02:18:00.24
Nope.

3403
02:18:00.24 --> 02:18:03.12
So I sent a text message to this guy named Jim who worked for Sean.

3404
02:18:03.12 --> 02:18:06.12
I'm like, Jim, who are you guys running against this guy?

3405
02:18:06.12 --> 02:18:11.20
And he writes me back and he goes, you know, and I write him back and go, ha ha ha.

3406
02:18:11.20 --> 02:18:12.40
And he didn't write me back.

3407
02:18:12.40 --> 02:18:17.28
So when you write something and somebody writes, ha ha ha, and they don't write back, they're

3408
02:18:17.28 --> 02:18:19.24
not joking.

3409
02:18:19.24 --> 02:18:24.52
And I was like, oh yeah, I should be right.

3410
02:18:24.52 --> 02:18:28.52
I fixed problems for decades.

3411
02:18:28.52 --> 02:18:30.84
So why aren't I fixing this problem?

3412
02:18:30.84 --> 02:18:33.24
And I decided to run for Congress.

3413
02:18:33.24 --> 02:18:37.68
So I got a hold of the RPW, Mark Jefferson, his executive director.

3414
02:18:37.68 --> 02:18:39.08
I did an interview with him.

3415
02:18:39.08 --> 02:18:42.16
And he's like, well, yeah, I guess.

3416
02:18:42.16 --> 02:18:47.68
And I formed this nascent political group.

3417
02:18:47.68 --> 02:18:48.68
Is this 2019?

3418
02:18:48.68 --> 02:18:49.68
This would be 2019.

3419
02:18:49.68 --> 02:18:50.68
Yeah.

3420
02:18:50.68 --> 02:18:55.36
So in 2019, and I formed my team.

3421
02:18:55.36 --> 02:18:56.36
I didn't know what I was doing.

3422
02:18:56.36 --> 02:18:57.60
Here's the metrics.

3423
02:18:57.60 --> 02:18:59.84
People like, there are these metrics.

3424
02:18:59.84 --> 02:19:06.48
So Ron kind had been in office for at that point, 24 years, 25 years, something like that.

3425
02:19:06.48 --> 02:19:09.64
He had $3.1 million in the bank.

3426
02:19:09.64 --> 02:19:12.96
He had a functioning political organization.

3427
02:19:12.96 --> 02:19:17.88
And he had 100% name recognition, 100% kind.

3428
02:19:17.88 --> 02:19:18.88
Right?

3429
02:19:18.88 --> 02:19:19.96
They have those kind bars.

3430
02:19:19.96 --> 02:19:21.64
That's not him.

3431
02:19:21.64 --> 02:19:27.12
I had never thought about being in politics ever, my entire life.

3432
02:19:27.12 --> 02:19:31.60
We moved to the district to be closer to the airport so we can visit our children.

3433
02:19:31.60 --> 02:19:35.48
So the only person that knew my name was my wife.

3434
02:19:35.48 --> 02:19:39.56
I have no money at all, zero name recognition.

3435
02:19:39.56 --> 02:19:41.32
That's the starting point.

3436
02:19:41.32 --> 02:19:43.40
I decided to run for office.

3437
02:19:43.40 --> 02:19:45.64
72 hours, I announced my candidacy.

3438
02:19:45.64 --> 02:19:48.48
They locked down the entire planet with COVID.

3439
02:19:48.48 --> 02:19:49.84
Boom.

3440
02:19:49.84 --> 02:19:54.80
So I ran a nine month campaign against those odds.

3441
02:19:54.80 --> 02:19:58.28
I came within like two and a half points of beating this guy.

3442
02:19:58.28 --> 02:20:03.04
And he wanted to spend over $6 million against me.

3443
02:20:03.04 --> 02:20:04.20
That's why he resigned.

3444
02:20:04.20 --> 02:20:07.04
Because I announced my candidacy.

3445
02:20:07.04 --> 02:20:08.04
I lost.

3446
02:20:08.04 --> 02:20:12.36
And I tried to, this is amazing.

3447
02:20:12.36 --> 02:20:14.84
You can say whatever you want about the 2020 election.

3448
02:20:14.84 --> 02:20:15.84
But I did the math.

3449
02:20:15.84 --> 02:20:16.84
I look at this.

3450
02:20:16.84 --> 02:20:17.84
I lost by 11,000 votes.

3451
02:20:17.84 --> 02:20:20.84
I go, I can't make up 11,000 votes.

3452
02:20:20.84 --> 02:20:21.84
You know what I mean?

3453
02:20:21.84 --> 02:20:24.76
Even if we found statistical anomalies and all that stuff, that's what I mean.

3454
02:20:24.76 --> 02:20:27.04
I can't, you know, I'm not going to be able to overcome that.

3455
02:20:27.04 --> 02:20:28.04
I try to call that cat.

3456
02:20:28.04 --> 02:20:32.16
I go, that night, like four in the morning, calling to concede the election.

3457
02:20:32.16 --> 02:20:33.16
Right?

3458
02:20:33.16 --> 02:20:34.16
Because you should.

3459
02:20:34.16 --> 02:20:36.56
He wouldn't take the phone call.

3460
02:20:36.56 --> 02:20:37.56
Interesting.

3461
02:20:37.56 --> 02:20:38.56
Not interesting.

3462
02:20:38.56 --> 02:20:44.32
That's an egotistical person whose entire being is based on being a politician who liked

3463
02:20:44.32 --> 02:20:47.60
being called to congressmen, had people open their doors for him.

3464
02:20:47.60 --> 02:20:52.000
And I got so close to beating him, like all throughout the night I was ahead.

3465
02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:55.84
And then like 15,000 votes show up at, you know, 2.30 in the morning or whatever, you

3466
02:20:55.84 --> 02:20:56.84
know, I get it.

3467
02:20:56.84 --> 02:20:57.96
Check their counting ballots that come in.

3468
02:20:57.96 --> 02:21:00.36
I get it.

3469
02:21:00.36 --> 02:21:04.08
He was so angry, he wouldn't take a phone call.

3470
02:21:04.08 --> 02:21:07.68
Not someone who has no business being in leadership anywhere.

3471
02:21:07.68 --> 02:21:08.68
Right?

3472
02:21:08.68 --> 02:21:10.28
I've heard of sore losers.

3473
02:21:10.28 --> 02:21:11.28
Soar winners.

3474
02:21:11.28 --> 02:21:12.28
What?

3475
02:21:12.28 --> 02:21:13.28
No.

3476
02:21:13.28 --> 02:21:17.60
So, um, yeah, I decided to run again because I was talking to Sarah Jane.

3477
02:21:17.60 --> 02:21:23.44
I mean, really that night I go, this is not going to bode well for the country, not me

3478
02:21:23.44 --> 02:21:24.44
personally.

3479
02:21:24.44 --> 02:21:26.88
I mean, my ego, it's over here.

3480
02:21:26.88 --> 02:21:30.000
This is not about me.

3481
02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:31.000
It's not.

3482
02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:32.000
It's about our country and our grandkids.

3483
02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:36.08
At that point we had six grandkids, you know, eight now.

3484
02:21:36.08 --> 02:21:38.72
So I understood that.

3485
02:21:38.72 --> 02:21:43.12
I had no idea it was going to get this bad this fast.

3486
02:21:43.12 --> 02:21:44.84
No one could predict this.

3487
02:21:44.84 --> 02:21:46.24
You just can't.

3488
02:21:46.24 --> 02:21:47.24
You could not.

3489
02:21:47.24 --> 02:21:49.08
But I decided to run again.

3490
02:21:49.08 --> 02:21:50.64
I waited, I shepherd everything.

3491
02:21:50.64 --> 02:21:53.20
I did some changes in my team.

3492
02:21:53.20 --> 02:21:57.12
And then we wound up running the number one political campaign in the entire nation for

3493
02:21:57.12 --> 02:22:01.44
2021 from Prairie to Sheen, you know, 5,600 people.

3494
02:22:01.44 --> 02:22:04.84
And then what, what, what makes you classify it against the number one political campaign

3495
02:22:04.84 --> 02:22:05.84
in the whole country?

3496
02:22:05.84 --> 02:22:09.88
So what the inside baseball stuff, because everybody understands intuitively or they

3497
02:22:09.88 --> 02:22:14.52
just know it, um, is that in order to get a word out, you have to be able to raise enough

3498
02:22:14.52 --> 02:22:18.08
funds to, to get the word out.

3499
02:22:18.08 --> 02:22:19.88
You know, I don't get any money from my campaign.

3500
02:22:19.88 --> 02:22:21.40
You can take a salary from a campaign.

3501
02:22:21.40 --> 02:22:24.64
I don't, I just don't think that's, you should do that.

3502
02:22:24.64 --> 02:22:29.44
But you have to buy television advertising cable, you print media, you got to pay a staff,

3503
02:22:29.44 --> 02:22:32.000
you know, all this stuff, gasoline, whatever.

3504
02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:36.68
So um, yeah, we, we raise more money than any Republican challenge or in the entire nation

3505
02:22:36.68 --> 02:22:37.68
in 2021.

3506
02:22:37.68 --> 02:22:40.04
But what drove that?

3507
02:22:40.04 --> 02:22:42.48
Me and my team.

3508
02:22:42.48 --> 02:22:44.72
I have an exceptionally good team.

3509
02:22:44.72 --> 02:22:46.92
I'm so incredibly proud of my team.

3510
02:22:46.92 --> 02:22:50.76
And you, you can perform at a high level for only a certain period of time.

3511
02:22:50.76 --> 02:22:52.92
You know this, you got to sleep at some time.

3512
02:22:52.92 --> 02:22:56.20
So how do you, how do you pull off sustained superior performance?

3513
02:22:56.20 --> 02:22:58.92
You make sure that you assemble the best team you possibly can.

3514
02:22:58.92 --> 02:23:02.68
So I have incredibly dedicated people who are all on board for the right reasons.

3515
02:23:02.68 --> 02:23:07.16
I integrate every single one of them personally and make sure that they're in this for something

3516
02:23:07.16 --> 02:23:09.60
beyond themselves, which is the country.

3517
02:23:09.60 --> 02:23:10.80
That's why we're successful.

3518
02:23:10.80 --> 02:23:12.96
Our mission is completely pure.

3519
02:23:12.96 --> 02:23:14.32
Message is pure.

3520
02:23:14.32 --> 02:23:15.80
And we're here for the right reasons.

3521
02:23:15.80 --> 02:23:17.08
We want to save our country.

3522
02:23:17.08 --> 02:23:19.16
And that's very, very rare.

3523
02:23:19.16 --> 02:23:23.60
I think there are some fantastic people in public office and leadership right now.

3524
02:23:23.60 --> 02:23:24.60
They're, they're fantastic.

3525
02:23:24.60 --> 02:23:25.60
A lot of them.

3526
02:23:25.60 --> 02:23:27.24
But other people are just kind of there.

3527
02:23:27.24 --> 02:23:33.36
They're the dude that was the Marops instructor for 15 years, you know, a trade at.

3528
02:23:33.36 --> 02:23:37.64
They're doing a function, but you know, why are they doing it?

3529
02:23:37.64 --> 02:23:39.56
That's why we're successful.

3530
02:23:39.56 --> 02:23:44.88
So what does this look like from here on out from, but what's the next, how, how many

3531
02:23:44.88 --> 02:23:47.04
months are we away right now?

3532
02:23:47.04 --> 02:23:48.04
We're 42 days.

3533
02:23:48.04 --> 02:23:49.04
42 days away.

3534
02:23:49.04 --> 02:23:52.52
And what does the next 42 days look like?

3535
02:23:52.52 --> 02:23:54.52
I work.

3536
02:23:54.52 --> 02:23:59.04
I, um, meeting, meeting, meeting, meeting, meeting, meeting.

3537
02:23:59.04 --> 02:24:00.04
This is my schedule.

3538
02:24:00.04 --> 02:24:02.36
I've been doing this for three years, dude.

3539
02:24:02.36 --> 02:24:04.36
Who do you meet with?

3540
02:24:04.36 --> 02:24:07.12
I meet with a bunch of different people.

3541
02:24:07.12 --> 02:24:10.80
My favorite meetings are with the guys in the district, the people I'm going to be representing.

3542
02:24:10.80 --> 02:24:13.24
I mean, what is going on, man?

3543
02:24:13.24 --> 02:24:16.52
Like how is your farm doing?

3544
02:24:16.52 --> 02:24:21.08
What is affecting you so that you can or cannot provide for your family as well?

3545
02:24:21.08 --> 02:24:23.52
The biggest thing we get input costs through the roof.

3546
02:24:23.52 --> 02:24:26.32
Joe Biden canceled the Keystone pipeline.

3547
02:24:26.32 --> 02:24:27.32
Okay.

3548
02:24:27.32 --> 02:24:28.32
Check this out.

3549
02:24:28.32 --> 02:24:30.80
Got any Tim Michaels is running for governor.

3550
02:24:30.80 --> 02:24:34.24
Then he's been a friend of mine for, I don't know, three years now or something.

3551
02:24:34.24 --> 02:24:35.24
Start.

3552
02:24:35.24 --> 02:24:36.24
He had his dad started a company.

3553
02:24:36.24 --> 02:24:37.64
He had a couple of hundred employees.

3554
02:24:37.64 --> 02:24:38.64
He has like 8,000 now.

3555
02:24:38.64 --> 02:24:40.88
He's going to win.

3556
02:24:40.88 --> 02:24:45.04
He calls me like the day or so after Biden gets sworn in, goes Derek, I just had to lay

3557
02:24:45.04 --> 02:24:47.96
off 700 people.

3558
02:24:47.96 --> 02:24:48.96
And I'm like, what do you mean, Tim?

3559
02:24:48.96 --> 02:24:54.80
He's like, we were doing the electrical substations for the Keystone pipeline and Biden just went

3560
02:24:54.80 --> 02:24:57.84
flick, shut that off.

3561
02:24:57.84 --> 02:25:01.60
So the cascading effects of these things, people don't understand.

3562
02:25:01.60 --> 02:25:04.56
And I do intuitively because I wrote all these plans and did this stuff and it's something

3563
02:25:04.56 --> 02:25:05.56
I'm good at.

3564
02:25:05.56 --> 02:25:09.16
So here's what happens when you stop natural gas movement and production.

3565
02:25:09.16 --> 02:25:11.80
Do you know where fertilizer comes from, Jaco?

3566
02:25:11.80 --> 02:25:12.80
Yeah.

3567
02:25:12.80 --> 02:25:13.80
Natural gas.

3568
02:25:13.80 --> 02:25:17.04
That's the nitrogen that comes from, that's where it comes from.

3569
02:25:17.04 --> 02:25:21.04
The Wisconsin's third district is one of the top five users of propane and natural gas

3570
02:25:21.04 --> 02:25:23.20
for home heating in the country.

3571
02:25:23.20 --> 02:25:26.04
It gets 20 degrees below zero.

3572
02:25:26.04 --> 02:25:28.96
You're not going to put an extra sweater on it like your mom used to tell you.

3573
02:25:28.96 --> 02:25:32.12
What about solar?

3574
02:25:32.12 --> 02:25:35.28
So check it out.

3575
02:25:35.28 --> 02:25:38.04
We want our grandchildren to have power, right?

3576
02:25:38.04 --> 02:25:39.84
But we have kids now.

3577
02:25:39.84 --> 02:25:42.28
So the Biden administration is trying to skip ahead a generation.

3578
02:25:42.28 --> 02:25:43.28
You can't do that.

3579
02:25:43.28 --> 02:25:48.88
The guy named Brent Ridge runs Dairyland Power, one of the biggest co-ops in my district.

3580
02:25:48.88 --> 02:25:51.76
We have a lot of co-ops because they're rural.

3581
02:25:51.76 --> 02:25:53.72
They did the math.

3582
02:25:53.72 --> 02:25:57.20
So the Biden administration wants to be carbon neutral by 2030.

3583
02:25:57.20 --> 02:25:58.20
Okay?

3584
02:25:58.20 --> 02:25:59.20
A noble goal.

3585
02:25:59.20 --> 02:26:00.20
You know what that takes?

3586
02:26:00.20 --> 02:26:06.36
You have to double the amount of all of the nuke plants on the entire planet.

3587
02:26:06.36 --> 02:26:10.60
So that is not a real goal.

3588
02:26:10.60 --> 02:26:11.92
It's just not.

3589
02:26:11.92 --> 02:26:18.80
So people are eating it right now because of these horrible policies.

3590
02:26:18.80 --> 02:26:19.80
Just that simple.

3591
02:26:19.80 --> 02:26:20.80
It's got to stop, man.

3592
02:26:20.80 --> 02:26:21.80
Yeah.

3593
02:26:21.80 --> 02:26:24.96
You know, people that are in business with me, and there's a lot of them.

3594
02:26:24.96 --> 02:26:28.20
We've got a lot of different businesses.

3595
02:26:28.20 --> 02:26:29.20
Sure.

3596
02:26:29.20 --> 02:26:33.76
And anyone that works with me knows that when I'm looking at things and we're assessing

3597
02:26:33.76 --> 02:26:36.96
something, I'll get to a point where I say, all right, run the numbers.

3598
02:26:36.96 --> 02:26:37.96
Right.

3599
02:26:37.96 --> 02:26:39.80
You know, which is, okay, well, tell me what this is going to cost.

3600
02:26:39.80 --> 02:26:40.80
How much we're going to put it into it?

3601
02:26:40.80 --> 02:26:41.80
What's the ROI look like?

3602
02:26:41.80 --> 02:26:42.80
What's the risk?

3603
02:26:42.80 --> 02:26:43.80
Well, run the numbers.

3604
02:26:43.80 --> 02:26:47.92
Tell me what the numbers look like because that's ultimately, and then the numbers,

3605
02:26:47.92 --> 02:26:52.16
you have to put that into the calculus of your gut feeling for sure.

3606
02:26:52.16 --> 02:26:55.80
But you can have a really strong positive gut feeling like, hey, this sounds like a

3607
02:26:55.80 --> 02:26:56.80
great idea.

3608
02:26:56.80 --> 02:26:59.92
And then you run the numbers and you go, hey, it's probably not going to work, man.

3609
02:26:59.92 --> 02:27:01.32
That's just too much.

3610
02:27:01.32 --> 02:27:02.32
Sometimes you go, you know what?

3611
02:27:02.32 --> 02:27:03.32
This is not a bad idea.

3612
02:27:03.32 --> 02:27:05.84
You run the numbers and you go, hey, this actually makes sense.

3613
02:27:05.84 --> 02:27:08.36
We can go for this.

3614
02:27:08.36 --> 02:27:11.32
And that's why kind of, you know, when you mentioned the closing of the pipeline, it

3615
02:27:11.32 --> 02:27:16.24
kind of, you know, because emotionally you think, well, this seems like a positive thing.

3616
02:27:16.24 --> 02:27:21.52
You know, people can look at it and go, hey, but we don't want to have to put pipes through

3617
02:27:21.52 --> 02:27:24.52
fields and then you run the numbers.

3618
02:27:24.52 --> 02:27:25.52
Right.

3619
02:27:25.52 --> 02:27:27.24
And you just run the numbers.

3620
02:27:27.24 --> 02:27:29.000
And it's not even really that close.

3621
02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:32.52
You know, it's the type of math that you just said, oh, we got to double the number of nuclear

3622
02:27:32.52 --> 02:27:35.72
plants in the next three years if we're going to get there.

3623
02:27:35.72 --> 02:27:36.72
That's what it's going to take.

3624
02:27:36.72 --> 02:27:37.72
In the world.

3625
02:27:37.72 --> 02:27:38.72
In the world.

3626
02:27:38.72 --> 02:27:39.72
Right.

3627
02:27:39.72 --> 02:27:40.96
So check this out, man.

3628
02:27:40.96 --> 02:27:43.32
We don't do enough running of numbers.

3629
02:27:43.32 --> 02:27:48.40
So you know, when you go to your house, let's say you're going to wash your hands and you

3630
02:27:48.40 --> 02:27:52.80
turn the faucet on and a little train car comes with water, right?

3631
02:27:52.80 --> 02:27:55.20
And then you pour the water out of the train car.

3632
02:27:55.20 --> 02:27:56.20
No.

3633
02:27:56.20 --> 02:27:59.88
How does it get into your faucet with a pipe?

3634
02:27:59.88 --> 02:28:02.32
Because it's the most efficient way to transport fluids.

3635
02:28:02.32 --> 02:28:03.32
Not even close.

3636
02:28:03.32 --> 02:28:04.32
Right.

3637
02:28:04.32 --> 02:28:06.08
And it's, and then you want to like light your gas stove.

3638
02:28:06.08 --> 02:28:08.80
Does a little train come and then you get gas?

3639
02:28:08.80 --> 02:28:10.48
No, that comes from a pipe too.

3640
02:28:10.48 --> 02:28:13.44
Now trains themselves, we, I'm in Prairie DeChain.

3641
02:28:13.44 --> 02:28:16.36
It's like train city USA, man.

3642
02:28:16.36 --> 02:28:23.48
Transporting bulk items like coal, for instance, and some other large POL things.

3643
02:28:23.48 --> 02:28:27.04
If you're going from point to point, you have to have a railhead, right?

3644
02:28:27.04 --> 02:28:29.92
So there's room for both of them.

3645
02:28:29.92 --> 02:28:31.76
That's what folks don't understand.

3646
02:28:31.76 --> 02:28:35.08
But we have a carbon based economy.

3647
02:28:35.08 --> 02:28:42.04
And if you shut off the fossil fuels that produce carbon, you're going to destroy the

3648
02:28:42.04 --> 02:28:43.04
economy.

3649
02:28:43.04 --> 02:28:44.92
That's what's happening right now.

3650
02:28:44.92 --> 02:28:46.92
You look at the food cost, dude.

3651
02:28:46.92 --> 02:28:48.40
Farmers have not locked in, wait, check it out.

3652
02:28:48.40 --> 02:28:51.48
Farmers have not locked in fertilizer prices for next year.

3653
02:28:51.48 --> 02:28:53.80
So it's going to keep going up and up and up.

3654
02:28:53.80 --> 02:28:58.32
There's two fertilizer plants that just closed in England.

3655
02:28:58.32 --> 02:29:00.48
There's one in Finland that went down.

3656
02:29:00.48 --> 02:29:05.04
I think they're only going to produce 24% of the fertilizer that they did before.

3657
02:29:05.04 --> 02:29:08.48
Russia is not going to export fertilizer anymore, probably for the future, at least

3658
02:29:08.48 --> 02:29:09.48
five years.

3659
02:29:09.48 --> 02:29:11.28
I mean, they hate us right now.

3660
02:29:11.28 --> 02:29:17.40
And there's these weird tariffs that we put on Morocco where they produce some fertilizers.

3661
02:29:17.40 --> 02:29:19.08
What can Congress do?

3662
02:29:19.08 --> 02:29:24.56
One thing right now, put pressure on the Biden administration to make sure that they open

3663
02:29:24.56 --> 02:29:29.08
up permitting and then get rid of the tariffs on Morocco.

3664
02:29:29.08 --> 02:29:35.16
So looking at all of these problems, people get really worried about a lot of stuff.

3665
02:29:35.16 --> 02:29:39.80
And the current leadership of the Republican Party, Kevin McCarthy in the House, we actually

3666
02:29:39.80 --> 02:29:41.64
have a plan.

3667
02:29:41.64 --> 02:29:46.28
And they've done a tremendous job of looking at all the problems and figuring out which

3668
02:29:46.28 --> 02:29:51.44
one of these from the federal level will we have the greatest probability of having the

3669
02:29:51.44 --> 02:29:53.000
greatest positive effect.

3670
02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.76
You know, that's how you're supposed to govern.

3671
02:29:55.76 --> 02:29:58.20
So I'm actually very excited.

3672
02:29:58.20 --> 02:30:00.48
The polls are looking outstanding for us.

3673
02:30:00.48 --> 02:30:02.92
When I say us, I mean my team.

3674
02:30:02.92 --> 02:30:08.04
I know I'm the head of the team, but us, we've done this together.

3675
02:30:08.04 --> 02:30:12.76
So I anticipate being elected in November and giving it a go, man.

3676
02:30:12.76 --> 02:30:14.60
It's not funny.

3677
02:30:14.60 --> 02:30:15.88
I think about that, dude.

3678
02:30:15.88 --> 02:30:18.16
I come from the meanest circumstances.

3679
02:30:18.16 --> 02:30:19.16
The meanest.

3680
02:30:19.16 --> 02:30:24.72
Well, you know, when I kind of opened with that thing from George Washington, I'd heard

3681
02:30:24.72 --> 02:30:31.36
that quote, read that quote a while ago and you know, you think about, you know, I just

3682
02:30:31.36 --> 02:30:37.76
know your career and know what, you know, as an average team guy, what you've done,

3683
02:30:37.76 --> 02:30:41.76
what you've been put through, what your family's been put through.

3684
02:30:41.76 --> 02:30:43.80
And it's like, how much are you going to ask from somebody?

3685
02:30:43.80 --> 02:30:48.000
And I look at the political arena and it makes me sick to my stomach.

3686
02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:52.76
Like I don't, I just think that just sounds, the whole thing sounds awful.

3687
02:30:52.76 --> 02:30:55.16
When you show me your calendar and I know you're going to a bunch of meetings with people

3688
02:30:55.16 --> 02:30:58.60
that half of them, you know, are horrible people, half of them are awesome people.

3689
02:30:58.60 --> 02:31:01.44
You got all this craziness going on.

3690
02:31:01.44 --> 02:31:02.44
I would not say that.

3691
02:31:02.44 --> 02:31:03.44
Okay.

3692
02:31:03.44 --> 02:31:04.44
The vast majority of them are awesome.

3693
02:31:04.44 --> 02:31:05.44
Okay.

3694
02:31:05.44 --> 02:31:06.44
Like vast.

3695
02:31:06.44 --> 02:31:12.000
Well, I know that when I look at what happens to politicians and you're going to get just,

3696
02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:16.04
you know, your life becomes this target, right?

3697
02:31:16.04 --> 02:31:21.32
And so I know that there's a ton of sacrifice that you and your family are going to make

3698
02:31:21.32 --> 02:31:22.32
again.

3699
02:31:22.32 --> 02:31:23.32
You bet.

3700
02:31:23.32 --> 02:31:25.04
In order to do this.

3701
02:31:25.04 --> 02:31:28.52
And yeah, I guess you wouldn't be setting meetings with people that despise you, but

3702
02:31:28.52 --> 02:31:34.32
look, the press is going to absolutely about a large majority of the press will absolutely

3703
02:31:34.32 --> 02:31:36.32
despise you and they're going to do everything to attack you.

3704
02:31:36.32 --> 02:31:37.56
They're going to attack your family.

3705
02:31:37.56 --> 02:31:42.76
They're going to attack your values, your home, your people, your community and everything.

3706
02:31:42.76 --> 02:31:47.84
So the fact that you're like, yeah, cool, Roger that, going to step up and try and make

3707
02:31:47.84 --> 02:31:50.40
this happen and looks like you are going to make this thing happen.

3708
02:31:50.40 --> 02:31:53.68
I'm not going to go there.

3709
02:31:53.68 --> 02:32:00.000
When you look at all the divisiveness in the country right now, one of the things that

3710
02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:04.28
I've given an answer to a bunch is something that we already kind of discussed, which is,

3711
02:32:04.28 --> 02:32:09.24
Hey, I look at something from my perspective and I think, well, you know, Derek has a good

3712
02:32:09.24 --> 02:32:10.24
point there.

3713
02:32:10.24 --> 02:32:12.12
Maybe he's right about this.

3714
02:32:12.12 --> 02:32:15.64
Instead of me thinking, well, Derek doesn't agree with every single point that I have.

3715
02:32:15.64 --> 02:32:18.000
So therefore he's completely wrong about everything.

3716
02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:21.48
I actually hate him.

3717
02:32:21.48 --> 02:32:25.08
How do we try to open people's minds up to get, Hey, you know what?

3718
02:32:25.08 --> 02:32:28.56
I get that you see things a little bit differently and you come from a different background than

3719
02:32:28.56 --> 02:32:32.32
me and I understand your idea.

3720
02:32:32.32 --> 02:32:37.88
At least I know where you're trying to go and it seems like in most cases we can be at

3721
02:32:37.88 --> 02:32:39.64
least somewhat aligned.

3722
02:32:39.64 --> 02:32:45.52
You know, you want for food prices to come down.

3723
02:32:45.52 --> 02:32:47.96
That seems like a universal universal.

3724
02:32:47.96 --> 02:32:51.68
Who would say, No, we think food should be more expensive.

3725
02:32:51.68 --> 02:32:57.40
So what we really should be talking about is if you want food prices to come down and

3726
02:32:57.40 --> 02:33:01.32
let's say you're a conservative, you're a conservative Republican and let's say I'm

3727
02:33:01.32 --> 02:33:06.36
a left wing Democrat and I want food prices to come down.

3728
02:33:06.36 --> 02:33:11.84
So we're actually aligned on where we want to go on that particular subject.

3729
02:33:11.84 --> 02:33:18.32
But it's like there can't even be agreement on that and we can have a logical discussion

3730
02:33:18.32 --> 02:33:21.000
about, Well, okay, well, run the numbers.

3731
02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:22.92
Show me the numbers that you're looking at and I'll show you the numbers that we're

3732
02:33:22.92 --> 02:33:27.12
looking at and let's have a discussion about how we can actually make the food prices come

3733
02:33:27.12 --> 02:33:28.12
down.

3734
02:33:28.12 --> 02:33:30.68
Let's try and figure something out.

3735
02:33:30.68 --> 02:33:32.40
How do we cross that bridge?

3736
02:33:32.40 --> 02:33:35.64
Well, how I plan on crossing that bridge.

3737
02:33:35.64 --> 02:33:40.20
So first and foremost, everyone needs to understand that I will work with anybody who is willing

3738
02:33:40.20 --> 02:33:43.52
to put the interest of the country above their own.

3739
02:33:43.52 --> 02:33:47.44
I don't care who you are, I will work with you and I've proven that over 26 years and

3740
02:33:47.44 --> 02:33:53.52
working the most diverse environments and hostile straight up hostile environments, people

3741
02:33:53.52 --> 02:33:55.80
trying to kill me environment.

3742
02:33:55.80 --> 02:33:59.36
So if you're going to put the betterment of the country in your congressional district

3743
02:33:59.36 --> 02:34:04.000
above your own personal interest, I'm on board.

3744
02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:08.28
And this is this is what I tell people to echoes what you're saying.

3745
02:34:08.28 --> 02:34:14.92
I said, you're going to agree with people oftentimes 90% of the time.

3746
02:34:14.92 --> 02:34:19.40
You know, if I agree with somebody 90% of the time, that's that's a big win, right?

3747
02:34:19.40 --> 02:34:24.72
How many people here can look themselves in the mirror and honestly say that you agree

3748
02:34:24.72 --> 02:34:28.16
with your spouse 90% of the time?

3749
02:34:28.16 --> 02:34:29.52
Almost nobody, right?

3750
02:34:29.52 --> 02:34:35.44
So finding common ground, that's the term finding common ground is imperative to make

3751
02:34:35.44 --> 02:34:40.96
sure that you can actually govern and when you do things strictly on party lines, you

3752
02:34:40.96 --> 02:34:44.96
lose the ability to closely identify common ground.

3753
02:34:44.96 --> 02:34:50.68
How Congress has gotten around this is they put these big omnibus bills together.

3754
02:34:50.68 --> 02:34:58.12
So you're going to using your example, this is going to unleash American energy.

3755
02:34:58.12 --> 02:35:00.68
Therefore the input cost for farming are going to go down.

3756
02:35:00.68 --> 02:35:04.44
That means food costs are going to go down or this is going to decrease the price of

3757
02:35:04.44 --> 02:35:07.32
diesel fuel, which decreases the transportation costs.

3758
02:35:07.32 --> 02:35:08.32
You understand, right?

3759
02:35:08.32 --> 02:35:13.24
And then they'll put something in here like, but we're going to have flag laws and you're

3760
02:35:13.24 --> 02:35:17.48
going to have your guns confiscated confiscated by the state, you know, which I fundamentally

3761
02:35:17.48 --> 02:35:19.04
did that is just wrong, right?

3762
02:35:19.04 --> 02:35:25.36
And they put them in the same bill so that they can vote on it for or against it and

3763
02:35:25.36 --> 02:35:28.08
they can justify it when they go back to their district.

3764
02:35:28.08 --> 02:35:30.68
That's got to stop.

3765
02:35:30.68 --> 02:35:37.16
It has to stop because in no way, shape or form do I support red flag laws.

3766
02:35:37.16 --> 02:35:38.16
I'll give you an example.

3767
02:35:38.16 --> 02:35:41.80
A well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free state, the right for

3768
02:35:41.80 --> 02:35:44.20
the people to keep their arms shall not be infringed.

3769
02:35:44.20 --> 02:35:46.72
That's the entire text of the Second Amendment, dude.

3770
02:35:46.72 --> 02:35:50.64
So that's out, but lowering food cost is in.

3771
02:35:50.64 --> 02:35:57.96
So in order to hold Congress accountable, Congress has to write clean legislation so

3772
02:35:57.96 --> 02:36:03.48
that I know exactly where Jaco and Echo sit on an issue.

3773
02:36:03.48 --> 02:36:04.48
That's got to happen.

3774
02:36:04.48 --> 02:36:05.60
Are we going to be able to pull it off?

3775
02:36:05.60 --> 02:36:08.56
I don't know.

3776
02:36:08.56 --> 02:36:15.36
But one of the things that I will do that everybody can count on is I will do me.

3777
02:36:15.36 --> 02:36:20.24
Meaning, like the first pledge that I make to everybody is I will not buy, sell or trade

3778
02:36:20.24 --> 02:36:23.20
individual stocks as long as I'm a sitting member of Congress.

3779
02:36:23.20 --> 02:36:25.36
I will not do that.

3780
02:36:25.36 --> 02:36:26.68
And people are like, well, what about this guy?

3781
02:36:26.68 --> 02:36:27.68
What about that guy?

3782
02:36:27.68 --> 02:36:28.68
What about that guy?

3783
02:36:28.68 --> 02:36:29.68
I'm going to do me.

3784
02:36:29.68 --> 02:36:34.12
I'm going to make sure that all the things I'm doing are as morally and ethically and

3785
02:36:34.12 --> 02:36:38.20
legally correct as I possibly can as a human being when I'm in Congress.

3786
02:36:38.20 --> 02:36:40.60
I'll start there.

3787
02:36:40.60 --> 02:36:41.60
Encourage is contagious.

3788
02:36:41.60 --> 02:36:43.10
We talked about that.

3789
02:36:43.10 --> 02:36:49.24
I mean, ideally, people will see that and the people that I'm working with, they'll

3790
02:36:49.24 --> 02:36:50.48
want to do that too.

3791
02:36:50.48 --> 02:36:57.16
I mean, people inherently, you know, they want to do things in a way that's beneficial

3792
02:36:57.16 --> 02:36:58.16
for other people.

3793
02:36:58.16 --> 02:36:59.68
The American people are benevolent.

3794
02:36:59.68 --> 02:37:03.28
We're the most generous country that has ever existed.

3795
02:37:03.28 --> 02:37:07.90
Our populace, you know, the regular people on the street.

3796
02:37:07.90 --> 02:37:11.88
So if you give them the opportunity to do what's right, a lot of people are going to

3797
02:37:11.88 --> 02:37:12.88
do what's right.

3798
02:37:12.88 --> 02:37:14.88
They just need to see somebody else do it.

3799
02:37:14.88 --> 02:37:17.48
You know what I mean?

3800
02:37:17.48 --> 02:37:18.48
Yeah.

3801
02:37:18.48 --> 02:37:31.40
I think America right now, you know, you're looking at anybody looks at some bill that's

3802
02:37:31.40 --> 02:37:37.40
coming before Congress, coming before the House, and it's whatever, 792 pages.

3803
02:37:37.40 --> 02:37:40.12
They don't even read it.

3804
02:37:40.12 --> 02:37:44.84
And there's not one person America that goes, that seems like a good thing.

3805
02:37:44.84 --> 02:37:49.36
And you could go down a whole laundry list of things that every American says, this is

3806
02:37:49.36 --> 02:37:51.36
bullshit.

3807
02:37:51.36 --> 02:37:52.36
This is bullshit.

3808
02:37:52.36 --> 02:37:54.92
What you just talked about, like having these multiple different.

3809
02:37:54.92 --> 02:37:55.92
Yeah.

3810
02:37:55.92 --> 02:37:56.92
Yeah.

3811
02:37:56.92 --> 02:37:57.92
Omnibus bills.

3812
02:37:57.92 --> 02:38:02.42
We got all these different categories that are being voted on in one bill.

3813
02:38:02.42 --> 02:38:07.000
Every American, every American goes, that's bullshit.

3814
02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:14.08
And there's only so long that the politicians can continue to get away with this bullshit

3815
02:38:14.08 --> 02:38:17.76
before Americans, because you got to remember where the people that were like, oh, you're

3816
02:38:17.76 --> 02:38:26.16
going to raise the tax on tea by two cents per freaking giant bundle of tea.

3817
02:38:26.16 --> 02:38:27.16
Yeah.

3818
02:38:27.16 --> 02:38:29.16
No, actually, we're going to fight you.

3819
02:38:29.16 --> 02:38:32.92
At some point, Americans go, hey, this is bullshit.

3820
02:38:32.92 --> 02:38:39.12
And we're going to get rid of you people that are doing these things that are clearly wrong.

3821
02:38:39.12 --> 02:38:41.20
They're so clearly wrong.

3822
02:38:41.20 --> 02:38:42.32
Everybody knows it.

3823
02:38:42.32 --> 02:38:45.04
And eventually we say, oh, yeah, we're done.

3824
02:38:45.04 --> 02:38:50.92
Now look, I don't even think it's going to, I think it's going to be a change like you're

3825
02:38:50.92 --> 02:38:52.64
the personification of this change.

3826
02:38:52.64 --> 02:38:53.64
Right?

3827
02:38:53.64 --> 02:38:56.08
It's not like everyone's going to get voted out tomorrow, but people are going to, oh,

3828
02:38:56.08 --> 02:38:57.08
yeah.

3829
02:38:57.08 --> 02:38:58.92
There's a guy that just went in there and said, yeah, this is a dumb idea.

3830
02:38:58.92 --> 02:39:02.68
Hey, you guys can't pull a wool over the Americans eyes anymore.

3831
02:39:02.68 --> 02:39:07.88
I think over the next several years, maybe even take five, maybe even take 10 years,

3832
02:39:07.88 --> 02:39:13.04
we're going to get rid of these things that are, for lack of a better word, bullshit.

3833
02:39:13.04 --> 02:39:14.04
Right.

3834
02:39:14.04 --> 02:39:16.96
So I want to be very clear.

3835
02:39:16.96 --> 02:39:22.72
I am absolutely, I 100% disavow any type of political violence.

3836
02:39:22.72 --> 02:39:24.28
I do not condone it.

3837
02:39:24.28 --> 02:39:28.44
And that will be the destruction of America if we take up arms against each other.

3838
02:39:28.44 --> 02:39:30.40
I'll have no part of that.

3839
02:39:30.40 --> 02:39:34.28
First time once combat Bosnia-Hurkshukovia, civil war, went to Afghanistan, turned into

3840
02:39:34.28 --> 02:39:37.72
civil war, Iraq turned into civil war, worked in the Horn of Africa, civil war.

3841
02:39:37.72 --> 02:39:40.08
I'll have no part of that in the United States of America.

3842
02:39:40.08 --> 02:39:44.04
So how do we prevent that from happening, which I will do anything to prevent that from

3843
02:39:44.04 --> 02:39:45.84
happening.

3844
02:39:45.84 --> 02:39:49.80
Political violence cannot be part of a discussion in the United States of America.

3845
02:39:49.80 --> 02:39:50.80
It cannot.

3846
02:39:50.80 --> 02:39:52.36
So how do we do it?

3847
02:39:52.36 --> 02:39:56.24
We do it by what you're saying.

3848
02:39:56.24 --> 02:40:03.40
We exercise our rights as American citizens and we get into office and we make the change

3849
02:40:03.40 --> 02:40:04.40
from the inside.

3850
02:40:04.40 --> 02:40:08.12
And here's what's, this is fascinating dude.

3851
02:40:08.12 --> 02:40:10.000
Okay.

3852
02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.92
Ask not what your country can do for you.

3853
02:40:12.92 --> 02:40:14.28
Ask what you can do for your country.

3854
02:40:14.28 --> 02:40:16.64
You want to say that?

3855
02:40:16.64 --> 02:40:19.76
John F. Kennedy, JFK said that, right?

3856
02:40:19.76 --> 02:40:22.64
So he said that in 62?

3857
02:40:22.64 --> 02:40:25.04
61, 62.

3858
02:40:25.04 --> 02:40:27.88
So we went from that, ask not what your country can do for you.

3859
02:40:27.88 --> 02:40:29.56
Ask what you can do for your country.

3860
02:40:29.56 --> 02:40:34.56
We went from that to you're going to do everything I say you're going to do.

3861
02:40:34.56 --> 02:40:35.56
You're going to lock your church.

3862
02:40:35.56 --> 02:40:36.92
You're going to close your business.

3863
02:40:36.92 --> 02:40:39.28
You're not going to be able to speak to each other freely.

3864
02:40:39.28 --> 02:40:42.20
You're going to go to this store, but not that store.

3865
02:40:42.20 --> 02:40:45.24
You're going to get a shot or you're going to get fired.

3866
02:40:45.24 --> 02:40:46.64
You're going to do everything.

3867
02:40:46.64 --> 02:40:50.40
You're going to give me your money, the sweat of your brow.

3868
02:40:50.40 --> 02:40:54.60
And if you don't willingly do this, I'm going to use the full course of power of the federal

3869
02:40:54.60 --> 02:40:58.20
government to compel you to do this.

3870
02:40:58.20 --> 02:40:59.20
You got that?

3871
02:40:59.20 --> 02:41:00.88
Who's that?

3872
02:41:00.88 --> 02:41:03.12
That's AOC.

3873
02:41:03.12 --> 02:41:09.20
So the Democrat party went from JFK to AOC in 50 some years.

3874
02:41:09.20 --> 02:41:11.32
How?

3875
02:41:11.32 --> 02:41:13.32
Republicans let them.

3876
02:41:13.32 --> 02:41:14.32
Something goes wrong on a mission.

3877
02:41:14.32 --> 02:41:16.08
Who's the first person you look at, dude?

3878
02:41:16.08 --> 02:41:17.20
It's you.

3879
02:41:17.20 --> 02:41:21.96
What did I do or not do that led to the failure of this mission?

3880
02:41:21.96 --> 02:41:25.16
Hopefully you're saying what did I do or not do that led to the success of this mission,

3881
02:41:25.16 --> 02:41:26.16
right?

3882
02:41:26.16 --> 02:41:27.24
Never take anything for granted.

3883
02:41:27.24 --> 02:41:32.72
So we as Republicans have let people get away with this for such an extended period of time.

3884
02:41:32.72 --> 02:41:36.76
And we've done it by saying, oh, they have the best interests of the country at hand.

3885
02:41:36.76 --> 02:41:37.92
They really do.

3886
02:41:37.92 --> 02:41:39.44
They want the same thing that we do.

3887
02:41:39.44 --> 02:41:42.72
Yeah, in some aspects you do, but in others they don't.

3888
02:41:42.72 --> 02:41:46.40
And there's people that want to fundamentally change the system of government that has

3889
02:41:46.40 --> 02:41:49.52
proven to be the best one on the entire planet, like ever in history.

3890
02:41:49.52 --> 02:41:52.000
You know what I mean?

3891
02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:53.72
We're one of the youngest countries in the world.

3892
02:41:53.72 --> 02:41:57.48
We are the oldest standing constitution in the world.

3893
02:41:57.48 --> 02:41:58.68
Why?

3894
02:41:58.68 --> 02:42:01.36
Because it is an incredibly functional and beautiful document.

3895
02:42:01.36 --> 02:42:03.40
There's people that want to throw the Constitution out.

3896
02:42:03.40 --> 02:42:04.40
Why?

3897
02:42:04.40 --> 02:42:07.60
Because they're not getting their way.

3898
02:42:07.60 --> 02:42:12.000
So the beauty about our Constitution is something's wrong in it.

3899
02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:15.68
The mechanism for changing it is written into the document itself.

3900
02:42:15.68 --> 02:42:16.68
It's the amendment process.

3901
02:42:16.68 --> 02:42:18.40
You know what I mean?

3902
02:42:18.40 --> 02:42:19.40
So use it.

3903
02:42:19.40 --> 02:42:20.88
And they're like, well, it's so hard.

3904
02:42:20.88 --> 02:42:21.88
Yeah.

3905
02:42:21.88 --> 02:42:22.88
It's supposed to be.

3906
02:42:22.88 --> 02:42:23.88
Right?

3907
02:42:23.88 --> 02:42:25.28
So are we changing stuff?

3908
02:42:25.28 --> 02:42:26.28
Yeah.

3909
02:42:26.28 --> 02:42:34.88
Are people waking up to how destructive the policies have the destructive effect that

3910
02:42:34.88 --> 02:42:35.88
the policies are having?

3911
02:42:35.88 --> 02:42:36.88
Yeah.

3912
02:42:36.88 --> 02:42:38.96
I mean, I see people that are just beside themselves.

3913
02:42:38.96 --> 02:42:44.48
That $10,000 college thing, they want to give $10,000 for student debt relief.

3914
02:42:44.48 --> 02:42:45.48
Check this out, man.

3915
02:42:45.48 --> 02:42:48.68
75% of my district does not have a four-year degree.

3916
02:42:48.68 --> 02:42:52.64
Only 9% of my district, 9% has a graduate degree.

3917
02:42:52.64 --> 02:42:54.96
And I did a roundtable with some folks.

3918
02:42:54.96 --> 02:42:56.20
And they're all blue-collar folks.

3919
02:42:56.20 --> 02:42:57.92
This is what, 21,000 square feet?

3920
02:42:57.92 --> 02:42:58.92
Yeah.

3921
02:42:58.92 --> 02:42:59.92
Okay.

3922
02:42:59.92 --> 02:43:01.92
This gym is 21,000 square feet is what he's referring to.

3923
02:43:01.92 --> 02:43:02.92
Yeah.

3924
02:43:02.92 --> 02:43:03.92
Sorry.

3925
02:43:03.92 --> 02:43:04.92
The gym is 21,000 square feet.

3926
02:43:04.92 --> 02:43:05.92
Or we do this thing at a HVAC place.

3927
02:43:05.92 --> 02:43:07.56
It's probably 18, 20,000 square feet.

3928
02:43:07.56 --> 02:43:09.32
Two brothers got this thing going.

3929
02:43:09.32 --> 02:43:12.64
They don't have high school degrees and then trade school.

3930
02:43:12.64 --> 02:43:14.84
We're in this beautiful business.

3931
02:43:14.84 --> 02:43:16.24
All the people are just real estate agents.

3932
02:43:16.24 --> 02:43:18.48
No one had a four-year degree.

3933
02:43:18.48 --> 02:43:19.96
And we're like, well, what do you think about this?

3934
02:43:19.96 --> 02:43:21.40
And I go, this is absurd, right?

3935
02:43:21.40 --> 02:43:23.60
So I do this roundtable, I go to a place to get lunch.

3936
02:43:23.60 --> 02:43:27.72
I'm talking to Hannah, is her name, H in the beginning, H at the end, I remember, because

3937
02:43:27.72 --> 02:43:30.80
she said that stuck in my mind.

3938
02:43:30.80 --> 02:43:31.80
And we started talking.

3939
02:43:31.80 --> 02:43:32.80
She goes, yeah, this is great.

3940
02:43:32.80 --> 02:43:33.80
You know, I graduated from college.

3941
02:43:33.80 --> 02:43:34.80
I have all this debt.

3942
02:43:34.80 --> 02:43:36.52
You know, I'm working here as a bartender.

3943
02:43:36.52 --> 02:43:43.08
And her degree was in, gosh, she was like public or communications with an art major,

3944
02:43:43.08 --> 02:43:44.08
or art minor, right?

3945
02:43:44.08 --> 02:43:47.16
I'm like, well, you know, kind of get what you pay for there.

3946
02:43:47.16 --> 02:43:48.60
She goes, yeah, I think it's a great idea.

3947
02:43:48.60 --> 02:43:50.12
Okay, Hannah, hold on a second.

3948
02:43:50.12 --> 02:43:52.72
Let's say this place is banging on a Friday night.

3949
02:43:52.72 --> 02:43:55.88
And there's 100 people here.

3950
02:43:55.88 --> 02:43:57.88
And you go, all right, time out.

3951
02:43:57.88 --> 02:44:00.36
91 of you go over there.

3952
02:44:00.36 --> 02:44:01.36
Okay.

3953
02:44:01.36 --> 02:44:04.44
And the other nine, you sit here.

3954
02:44:04.44 --> 02:44:08.44
All 91 of you are going to pay for everything they eat and drink tonight.

3955
02:44:08.44 --> 02:44:09.88
And you're going to sit there and watch them.

3956
02:44:09.88 --> 02:44:12.08
And I go, would they be matched?

3957
02:44:12.08 --> 02:44:14.08
She goes, yeah, that's just unfair.

3958
02:44:14.08 --> 02:44:19.64
And I was like, okay, so 91 folks, even if they were just getting it, you know, you're

3959
02:44:19.64 --> 02:44:23.52
talking 25 bucks a person, maybe?

3960
02:44:23.52 --> 02:44:26.44
I mean, they can have lavish dinner, right?

3961
02:44:26.44 --> 02:44:32.64
So this is $2,500 out of every single American taxpayers wallet to pay for somebody to have

3962
02:44:32.64 --> 02:44:33.64
dinner on you.

3963
02:44:33.64 --> 02:44:38.48
No, that doesn't make sense on any planet, right?

3964
02:44:38.48 --> 02:44:41.60
And I told her that and she's like, wow, yeah, that is just unfair.

3965
02:44:41.60 --> 02:44:45.20
I'm like, Hannah, Hannah, run the numbers.

3966
02:44:45.20 --> 02:44:46.20
Walk the dog.

3967
02:44:46.20 --> 02:44:47.20
That's what I call it.

3968
02:44:47.20 --> 02:44:48.20
Walk the dog on this.

3969
02:44:48.20 --> 02:44:49.92
You know what I mean?

3970
02:44:49.92 --> 02:44:50.92
It doesn't make sense.

3971
02:44:50.92 --> 02:44:56.28
So people are seeing that and there's so many reasons to be discouraged, Jaco.

3972
02:44:56.28 --> 02:44:57.84
And you can always find one.

3973
02:44:57.84 --> 02:44:58.84
You can always find no.

3974
02:44:58.84 --> 02:45:01.28
No is easy.

3975
02:45:01.28 --> 02:45:02.28
It is.

3976
02:45:02.28 --> 02:45:03.28
It's easy to see the world.

3977
02:45:03.28 --> 02:45:04.28
No.

3978
02:45:04.28 --> 02:45:06.12
And it's easy to get discouraged.

3979
02:45:06.12 --> 02:45:10.48
It's easy to get down, you know, with all the circumstances.

3980
02:45:10.48 --> 02:45:16.20
But I'm telling you, if you wake up in the morning like I do and you just have an overwhelming

3981
02:45:16.20 --> 02:45:20.12
sense of gratitude like we talked about, just be so gracious.

3982
02:45:20.12 --> 02:45:21.12
Look at yourself.

3983
02:45:21.12 --> 02:45:24.72
Look at the things, the opportunities that you have as a human being in the United States

3984
02:45:24.72 --> 02:45:30.84
of America right now to create something, to do something worthwhile, to help somebody

3985
02:45:30.84 --> 02:45:31.84
out.

3986
02:45:31.84 --> 02:45:33.44
That doesn't exist in a lot of countries.

3987
02:45:33.44 --> 02:45:36.40
And when you just take a minute and go like, yeah, you know, I'm going to go buy that cup

3988
02:45:36.40 --> 02:45:37.40
of coffee.

3989
02:45:37.40 --> 02:45:40.28
I do that for cops and they're like, I'm sorry, sir, I can't accept a gift.

3990
02:45:40.28 --> 02:45:42.20
And I'm like, you're not the boss me, dude.

3991
02:45:42.20 --> 02:45:44.28
Like I don't work for you.

3992
02:45:44.28 --> 02:45:45.28
Police officer X.

3993
02:45:45.28 --> 02:45:48.48
You know, I'm buying you this cup of coffee, dude.

3994
02:45:48.48 --> 02:45:52.52
Or you help out a homeless person, like help them out, not just throw money at them because

3995
02:45:52.52 --> 02:45:53.52
that doesn't help anybody.

3996
02:45:53.52 --> 02:45:55.32
I mean, it doesn't.

3997
02:45:55.32 --> 02:45:57.32
The ability to do that is unique.

3998
02:45:57.32 --> 02:45:59.20
And we got to remember that.

3999
02:45:59.20 --> 02:46:01.52
And you got to tell your friends.

4000
02:46:01.52 --> 02:46:05.80
And you got to encourage your friends to tell other people because you've seen the downward

4001
02:46:05.80 --> 02:46:11.92
spiral, you know, when things start going bad and then it's just that it's this, this

4002
02:46:11.92 --> 02:46:14.12
negative feedback loop that people get into.

4003
02:46:14.12 --> 02:46:19.56
We're in a negative feedback loop, but the inputs are coming from our government.

4004
02:46:19.56 --> 02:46:23.42
And we should be in a negative feedback loop right now.

4005
02:46:23.42 --> 02:46:25.44
So how do you get out of that?

4006
02:46:25.44 --> 02:46:27.96
You put goodness in there.

4007
02:46:27.96 --> 02:46:28.96
That's what we're doing.

4008
02:46:28.96 --> 02:46:34.36
It's, I mean, some things are so basically, you know, philosophical.

4009
02:46:34.36 --> 02:46:38.88
It was interesting teaching special reconnaissance because you have time to reflect.

4010
02:46:38.88 --> 02:46:39.88
When do you have time to reflect?

4011
02:46:39.88 --> 02:46:42.28
And I mean, they started with videos.

4012
02:46:42.28 --> 02:46:45.56
Remember, like two minutes long, then they made them one minute, then they made them

4013
02:46:45.56 --> 02:46:46.56
30 seconds.

4014
02:46:46.56 --> 02:46:48.40
Oh, you're just talking about social media videos.

4015
02:46:48.40 --> 02:46:50.88
Yeah, they're what seven seconds now.

4016
02:46:50.88 --> 02:46:56.000
So there's been a crunch of the attention span of people and it removes your ability

4017
02:46:56.000 --> 02:46:57.28
to reflect on something.

4018
02:46:57.28 --> 02:47:01.96
You truly don't understand something until you ponder it and teaching special reconnaissance

4019
02:47:01.96 --> 02:47:04.32
and doing special reconnaissance missions.

4020
02:47:04.32 --> 02:47:05.80
You have time to ponder things.

4021
02:47:05.80 --> 02:47:06.80
Yes, you do.

4022
02:47:06.80 --> 02:47:11.52
And sometimes pondering while you're freezing and starving, you know, but, um, and again,

4023
02:47:11.52 --> 02:47:16.40
starting as a kid, you know, reading so much, reading takes time and reflection.

4024
02:47:16.40 --> 02:47:21.84
And when you're, you're putting an author's voice inside of your mind because you're reading

4025
02:47:21.84 --> 02:47:25.88
it and you're, you know, you're hearing that inside.

4026
02:47:25.88 --> 02:47:29.12
You're not receiving this like a television image.

4027
02:47:29.12 --> 02:47:31.44
It's you internalize it.

4028
02:47:31.44 --> 02:47:34.24
So we're putting some good in there.

4029
02:47:34.24 --> 02:47:35.24
Yeah.

4030
02:47:35.24 --> 02:47:36.80
We're injecting good into the cycle.

4031
02:47:36.80 --> 02:47:37.80
Seriously.

4032
02:47:37.80 --> 02:47:39.56
So being there, it's, I want you to listen to people.

4033
02:47:39.56 --> 02:47:40.56
I want you to be encouraged.

4034
02:47:40.56 --> 02:47:42.16
You live in the best country in the world.

4035
02:47:42.16 --> 02:47:46.28
If you're in America right now, and if you're not, move here legally, emigrate to the United

4036
02:47:46.28 --> 02:47:51.40
States of America and we'll welcome you with open arms if you do it the right way.

4037
02:47:51.40 --> 02:47:52.56
Check.

4038
02:47:52.56 --> 02:47:54.48
That gets us, I think that gets us up to date.

4039
02:47:54.48 --> 02:47:56.12
That's where we're at, right?

4040
02:47:56.12 --> 02:47:58.36
Um, these are excellent, by the way.

4041
02:47:58.36 --> 02:47:59.36
Oh, thank you.

4042
02:47:59.36 --> 02:48:00.36
Yeah.

4043
02:48:00.36 --> 02:48:01.36
Thank you.

4044
02:48:01.36 --> 02:48:02.36
Appreciate it.

4045
02:48:02.36 --> 02:48:03.36
I haven't had one before.

4046
02:48:03.36 --> 02:48:04.36
I guess you have this whole line of everything, right?

4047
02:48:04.36 --> 02:48:08.68
We got a line of a bunch of stuff, you know, we got a, we got, um, we're making supplements

4048
02:48:08.68 --> 02:48:09.68
here.

4049
02:48:09.68 --> 02:48:15.04
Um, we've got clothing, we got factories, we got two factories in Maine, we got maybe

4050
02:48:15.04 --> 02:48:17.84
three factories in Maine, depending on what you're counting as a factory.

4051
02:48:17.84 --> 02:48:22.08
And we just consolidated, we're in the process of consolidating our two factories in North

4052
02:48:22.08 --> 02:48:24.24
Carolina to one factory in North Carolina.

4053
02:48:24.24 --> 02:48:25.88
Well, back up.

4054
02:48:25.88 --> 02:48:29.36
Why don't you have a factory in the third congressional district of the state of Wisconsin?

4055
02:48:29.36 --> 02:48:30.36
We can talk about that.

4056
02:48:30.36 --> 02:48:32.24
Let's talk about that.

4057
02:48:32.24 --> 02:48:33.96
We can go out there and check it out.

4058
02:48:33.96 --> 02:48:37.60
And as, as we grow, which we're growing very rapidly right now, and the reason we're growing

4059
02:48:37.60 --> 02:48:41.52
very rapidly is because people want American made stuff.

4060
02:48:41.52 --> 02:48:42.52
Sure.

4061
02:48:42.52 --> 02:48:43.96
Hey dude, we've got power.

4062
02:48:43.96 --> 02:48:49.56
We've got rail, uh, during the, um, summertime, we've got the Mississippi River to move, uh,

4063
02:48:49.56 --> 02:48:50.56
commodities up and down.

4064
02:48:50.56 --> 02:48:56.000
And I have the most fantastical, hardworking, uh, ethically sound badass Americans in the

4065
02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:57.000
world.

4066
02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.60
Well, that, that is, that is outstanding.

4067
02:48:59.60 --> 02:49:02.08
And, and that's what we're looking for.

4068
02:49:02.08 --> 02:49:06.64
Um, you know, we've, we've kind of, we're a little bit maxed out our resources or human

4069
02:49:06.64 --> 02:49:08.08
capital up in Maine.

4070
02:49:08.08 --> 02:49:11.12
We're still getting people that are, I mean, the beautiful thing is we've got people coming

4071
02:49:11.12 --> 02:49:14.44
in from all over the country are moving to Maine, moving to North Carolina, knocking

4072
02:49:14.44 --> 02:49:15.44
on the door.

4073
02:49:15.44 --> 02:49:16.44
I want a job.

4074
02:49:16.44 --> 02:49:17.44
I want to work here.

4075
02:49:17.44 --> 02:49:18.44
It's, it's outstanding.

4076
02:49:18.44 --> 02:49:22.44
Uh, and so that's been a huge part of it.

4077
02:49:22.44 --> 02:49:25.24
Um, just growing that, but yeah, we make boots.

4078
02:49:25.24 --> 02:49:26.48
We make jeans.

4079
02:49:26.48 --> 02:49:28.04
We make hunt, hunt gear.

4080
02:49:28.04 --> 02:49:29.36
So American made hunt gear.

4081
02:49:29.36 --> 02:49:33.76
I don't think there's anyone more patriotic in the world than hunters in the, in the

4082
02:49:33.76 --> 02:49:35.04
country than hunters.

4083
02:49:35.04 --> 02:49:37.92
Hunters need to vote like 30% of hunters vote.

4084
02:49:37.92 --> 02:49:38.92
Oh, really?

4085
02:49:38.92 --> 02:49:42.80
That little, we all sit around and are, you know, griping about this and that.

4086
02:49:42.80 --> 02:49:44.12
They don't vote.

4087
02:49:44.12 --> 02:49:46.48
If you're a hunter, vote, register and vote.

4088
02:49:46.48 --> 02:49:47.48
No doubt about it.

4089
02:49:47.48 --> 02:49:48.48
You can't, no doubt about it.

4090
02:49:48.48 --> 02:49:52.56
If you're not part of the problem for hunting rights, for gun rights, for conservation,

4091
02:49:52.56 --> 02:49:53.56
right?

4092
02:49:53.56 --> 02:49:56.56
Like you definitely want to be voting if you're not voting right now.

4093
02:49:56.56 --> 02:50:00.80
But they definitely, I mean, I saw a bunch of hunters over the past, you know, September,

4094
02:50:00.80 --> 02:50:05.80
the past hunting season for me and everyone is just so excited about being able to buy

4095
02:50:05.80 --> 02:50:11.44
stuff that's made in America because this is, you're literally taking money out of our

4096
02:50:11.44 --> 02:50:12.44
economy.

4097
02:50:12.44 --> 02:50:16.48
When you buy something from overseas, you're just giving that money, not only giving it

4098
02:50:16.48 --> 02:50:19.96
overseas, but they don't care about the environment at all in these overseas factories.

4099
02:50:19.96 --> 02:50:21.96
They definitely don't take care of their workers.

4100
02:50:21.96 --> 02:50:22.96
Their workers have no future.

4101
02:50:22.96 --> 02:50:23.96
Their slave labor.

4102
02:50:23.96 --> 02:50:24.96
It's, it's, it's horrible.

4103
02:50:24.96 --> 02:50:32.92
We are paying the Chinese Communist Party to oppress their people and plot against the

4104
02:50:32.92 --> 02:50:35.36
existence of the United States.

4105
02:50:35.36 --> 02:50:38.44
That's what is happening.

4106
02:50:38.44 --> 02:50:44.92
And that's what me and my friends are doing to push back against that is bringing manufacturing

4107
02:50:44.92 --> 02:50:45.92
back to America.

4108
02:50:45.92 --> 02:50:46.92
I mean, you love it.

4109
02:50:46.92 --> 02:50:53.56
We are literally, we have, have literally brought machines that were outsourced to America

4110
02:50:53.56 --> 02:50:55.12
from America 30 years ago.

4111
02:50:55.12 --> 02:50:59.76
We've bought them and have brought them back to America and are putting them to use.

4112
02:50:59.76 --> 02:51:02.08
That's what we're actually doing it right now.

4113
02:51:02.08 --> 02:51:05.40
I mean, we got, we got great documentation of this too.

4114
02:51:05.40 --> 02:51:06.72
So that's what we're doing.

4115
02:51:06.72 --> 02:51:13.80
Well, I tell you what, dude, let me get elected, keep working hard and then student official

4116
02:51:13.80 --> 02:51:14.80
visit.

4117
02:51:14.80 --> 02:51:15.80
Yeah.

4118
02:51:15.80 --> 02:51:21.000
Well, because I listen, I will do anything to help the people that I'm representing.

4119
02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:24.68
Those three conditions, morally, ethically and legally correct, then we got, we have

4120
02:51:24.68 --> 02:51:32.20
to find ways that meet those parameters with the end state of your congressional district,

4121
02:51:32.20 --> 02:51:34.72
the state and the country are better off because of it.

4122
02:51:34.72 --> 02:51:35.72
Yeah.

4123
02:51:35.72 --> 02:51:38.56
And it's, it's just a little nose to the grindstone, dude.

4124
02:51:38.56 --> 02:51:42.48
We really got to think about what's taking place and then act on it.

4125
02:51:42.48 --> 02:51:43.48
Yeah.

4126
02:51:43.48 --> 02:51:45.84
Well, a huge part, a huge part of what you're talking about is, you know, you've said this

4127
02:51:45.84 --> 02:51:48.80
multiple times, you got to put your country first.

4128
02:51:48.80 --> 02:51:55.12
And you know, when, when, when I've, as I've gotten involved in the, in these industries,

4129
02:51:55.12 --> 02:51:59.84
you can look back very easily in the last 40 years, 30 years really of the history of

4130
02:51:59.84 --> 02:52:07.52
the companies in America where you can increase your profits, your short term profits by a

4131
02:52:07.52 --> 02:52:12.24
little percentage and therefore you make this and oh, you know what, we can, we can, it's

4132
02:52:12.24 --> 02:52:14.08
going to cost us more to get it over here.

4133
02:52:14.08 --> 02:52:15.76
It's going to cost us to transport it.

4134
02:52:15.76 --> 02:52:20.92
It's going to cost us time, but we got plenty of time because we're big and it's going

4135
02:52:20.92 --> 02:52:24.40
to save us, you know, 38 cents a garment.

4136
02:52:24.40 --> 02:52:25.56
Let's do it.

4137
02:52:25.56 --> 02:52:26.56
And that's what they did.

4138
02:52:26.56 --> 02:52:27.56
Right.

4139
02:52:27.56 --> 02:52:28.56
And they did that over and over again.

4140
02:52:28.56 --> 02:52:32.20
And then they spread the lie of not, not what they, what we were up against is they

4141
02:52:32.20 --> 02:52:35.28
said, oh, you can't, it's impossible to do this in America now.

4142
02:52:35.28 --> 02:52:36.28
Right.

4143
02:52:36.28 --> 02:52:37.28
It's impossible.

4144
02:52:37.28 --> 02:52:38.28
I was like, are you kidding me?

4145
02:52:38.28 --> 02:52:39.28
This is America.

4146
02:52:39.28 --> 02:52:40.28
It's America.

4147
02:52:40.28 --> 02:52:41.28
This is America.

4148
02:52:41.28 --> 02:52:42.28
We outproduced the world.

4149
02:52:42.28 --> 02:52:43.28
Right.

4150
02:52:43.28 --> 02:52:44.28
And we can build anything.

4151
02:52:44.28 --> 02:52:45.28
We can make anything.

4152
02:52:45.28 --> 02:52:49.56
And, and look, it starts with boots and clothing and jeans and jujitsu, geese and rash guards.

4153
02:52:49.56 --> 02:52:50.56
That's where we're starting.

4154
02:52:50.56 --> 02:52:53.72
I don't know where we're going to finish, but that's what we're doing.

4155
02:52:53.72 --> 02:52:58.04
So we, we have a, we have a globally integrated economy.

4156
02:52:58.04 --> 02:52:59.04
Right.

4157
02:52:59.04 --> 02:53:04.68
It's carbon based and, and I'm okay with that too, to an extent.

4158
02:53:04.68 --> 02:53:08.20
What I'm not is I'm not a globalist.

4159
02:53:08.20 --> 02:53:15.60
And I understand that we need to make sure that we're putting the interest of our people

4160
02:53:15.60 --> 02:53:16.60
first.

4161
02:53:16.60 --> 02:53:24.68
And the best example of this is let's say your, you know, 98 year old person with osteoporosis,

4162
02:53:24.68 --> 02:53:28.68
whatever, and you see someone being assaulted.

4163
02:53:28.68 --> 02:53:30.20
Can you help that person?

4164
02:53:30.20 --> 02:53:31.20
No.

4165
02:53:31.20 --> 02:53:34.40
I mean, you can call police, but you can't get in there.

4166
02:53:34.40 --> 02:53:39.20
So you, you have to be strong in order to help somebody.

4167
02:53:39.20 --> 02:53:45.20
And this administration either doesn't understand that or they don't care.

4168
02:53:45.20 --> 02:53:55.88
So when you are, the difference between equality and equity is everyone should have the, everyone

4169
02:53:55.88 --> 02:54:00.40
should have the ability to start with a level playing field.

4170
02:54:00.40 --> 02:54:02.16
You know what I mean?

4171
02:54:02.16 --> 02:54:09.84
And then you, you succeed or fail predicated on your God given gifts and your drive.

4172
02:54:09.84 --> 02:54:10.84
Right.

4173
02:54:10.84 --> 02:54:20.04
But if I force you to perform less so that you have equity, vice equality, it ruins everything.

4174
02:54:20.04 --> 02:54:22.16
That's Thomas souls.

4175
02:54:22.16 --> 02:54:23.16
Brilliant.

4176
02:54:23.16 --> 02:54:24.16
Yeah.

4177
02:54:24.16 --> 02:54:27.16
We've been kind of exploring bringing him out to bring him on the podcast.

4178
02:54:27.16 --> 02:54:33.32
If you do, can I come talk about him a bunch and he's definitely had a big influence on

4179
02:54:33.32 --> 02:54:34.44
the way that I think.

4180
02:54:34.44 --> 02:54:36.08
Equality of opportunity, not outcome.

4181
02:54:36.08 --> 02:54:37.08
Yeah.

4182
02:54:37.08 --> 02:54:38.08
Just brilliant.

4183
02:54:38.08 --> 02:54:39.08
Yeah.

4184
02:54:39.08 --> 02:54:40.08
Yeah.

4185
02:54:40.08 --> 02:54:41.08
So echo.

4186
02:54:41.08 --> 02:54:42.08
Yeah.

4187
02:54:42.08 --> 02:54:43.08
What's up, man?

4188
02:54:43.08 --> 02:54:44.08
You have any questions?

4189
02:54:44.08 --> 02:54:45.08
Yeah.

4190
02:54:45.08 --> 02:54:46.08
Let's rewind a little bit.

4191
02:54:46.08 --> 02:54:48.64
Oh, oh, oh, you're working at a gas station.

4192
02:54:48.64 --> 02:54:49.64
Yes.

4193
02:54:49.64 --> 02:54:50.64
Did you have any roommates at that time?

4194
02:54:50.64 --> 02:54:52.80
No, no, I was working at dry steel Chevron.

4195
02:54:52.80 --> 02:54:56.12
So you could work at Chevron and have your own apartment.

4196
02:54:56.12 --> 02:54:58.000
Granted, we're starving for sure.

4197
02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.12
Wait, so check this out.

4198
02:55:00.12 --> 02:55:03.20
You guys, do you track Dennis Prager?

4199
02:55:03.20 --> 02:55:04.20
Yeah.

4200
02:55:04.20 --> 02:55:05.20
Okay.

4201
02:55:05.20 --> 02:55:08.36
So Prager, you, they did, you know, those series of four minute videos, they did this

4202
02:55:08.36 --> 02:55:09.36
one.

4203
02:55:09.36 --> 02:55:13.68
There's, if you do three things, it doesn't matter where you start on the lower socioeconomic

4204
02:55:13.68 --> 02:55:16.52
scale, you're going to wind up in the middle class.

4205
02:55:16.52 --> 02:55:19.80
You graduate from high school.

4206
02:55:19.80 --> 02:55:23.72
You do not have a child out of wedlock and you have a full time job.

4207
02:55:23.72 --> 02:55:27.28
That could be at the gas station, that could be anywhere, right?

4208
02:55:27.28 --> 02:55:32.28
So you do these three things, statistically, you're going to wind up in the middle class.

4209
02:55:32.28 --> 02:55:33.28
It just takes those things.

4210
02:55:33.28 --> 02:55:39.24
And a lot of people give guff about intergenerational wealth transfer, right?

4211
02:55:39.24 --> 02:55:46.68
Well, we were raised dirt poor, but my mom, because she was a hard worker, when she died,

4212
02:55:46.68 --> 02:55:51.36
she had a home and we sold the home because we didn't want to live there.

4213
02:55:51.36 --> 02:55:55.52
And then we had to pay a bunch of taxes and then we received this, you know, a little

4214
02:55:55.52 --> 02:55:57.56
nest egg from my mom.

4215
02:55:57.56 --> 02:56:01.58
That's money that went from one generation to another.

4216
02:56:01.58 --> 02:56:05.36
That is intergenerational wealth transfer.

4217
02:56:05.36 --> 02:56:07.000
And alls it takes, I mean, that's what it is.

4218
02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:10.44
I mean, you don't get to make up the, I know we're seals, seals make up definitions of

4219
02:56:10.44 --> 02:56:12.24
words all the time, by the way.

4220
02:56:12.24 --> 02:56:13.24
Okay.

4221
02:56:13.24 --> 02:56:14.24
Yeah.

4222
02:56:14.24 --> 02:56:15.24
They'll change your name.

4223
02:56:15.24 --> 02:56:16.68
You know, Jason, I'll say his name.

4224
02:56:16.68 --> 02:56:18.68
Jason, Jason Gabel.

4225
02:56:18.68 --> 02:56:19.68
Yeah.

4226
02:56:19.68 --> 02:56:20.68
Okay.

4227
02:56:20.68 --> 02:56:21.68
Jason Gabel.

4228
02:56:21.68 --> 02:56:24.56
He was in Buds and they're like, were you in Buds with him?

4229
02:56:24.56 --> 02:56:25.92
No, I was not.

4230
02:56:25.92 --> 02:56:26.92
He's after me.

4231
02:56:26.92 --> 02:56:27.92
Okay.

4232
02:56:27.92 --> 02:56:32.60
So J bell is the same, you know, Jason, he was my, he was my LPO when I was at team

4233
02:56:32.60 --> 02:56:33.60
seven.

4234
02:56:33.60 --> 02:56:34.60
Okay.

4235
02:56:34.60 --> 02:56:37.56
He just finished directing an episode of seal team over in Jordan, I think.

4236
02:56:37.56 --> 02:56:38.56
Yeah.

4237
02:56:38.56 --> 02:56:39.56
So we're buddies.

4238
02:56:39.56 --> 02:56:40.56
I did him.

4239
02:56:40.56 --> 02:56:42.56
He asked me, he's like, Hey, I want you to play an airships captain in a movie.

4240
02:56:42.56 --> 02:56:43.96
I'm directing with Nicholas Cage.

4241
02:56:43.96 --> 02:56:45.96
And I'm like, okay, I was working at the cafe.

4242
02:56:45.96 --> 02:56:48.56
I've never chased acting before, but he called me because they're friends.

4243
02:56:48.56 --> 02:56:50.96
I'm like, sure, I'll do that.

4244
02:56:50.96 --> 02:56:54.68
So J bell, he's in Buds and they're like, get over here.

4245
02:56:54.68 --> 02:56:55.84
And like, get over here cable.

4246
02:56:55.84 --> 02:56:59.16
And he's like, it's Cabell and he's like, don't church it up.

4247
02:56:59.16 --> 02:57:01.60
Your name is cable.

4248
02:57:01.60 --> 02:57:04.88
So it's literally changed your, your name.

4249
02:57:04.88 --> 02:57:05.88
So sorry.

4250
02:57:05.88 --> 02:57:06.88
Yeah.

4251
02:57:06.88 --> 02:57:07.88
Gas station poor.

4252
02:57:07.88 --> 02:57:08.88
Yeah.

4253
02:57:08.88 --> 02:57:09.88
But you had your own apartment though.

4254
02:57:09.88 --> 02:57:10.88
Sure.

4255
02:57:10.88 --> 02:57:14.36
I'm just saying it seems like here and here in San Diego anyway, if I work at Chevron,

4256
02:57:14.36 --> 02:57:16.16
I don't think I'm getting my own apartment.

4257
02:57:16.16 --> 02:57:17.16
Then move.

4258
02:57:17.16 --> 02:57:18.16
Can you?

4259
02:57:18.16 --> 02:57:19.16
Can you get a different job?

4260
02:57:19.16 --> 02:57:24.60
Well, honestly, we, there's people that here that live here that work at Chevron that live

4261
02:57:24.60 --> 02:57:26.40
somewhere, they have apartments or something.

4262
02:57:26.40 --> 02:57:27.40
Right.

4263
02:57:27.40 --> 02:57:31.72
But with a roommate or something like this, actually, you know, when, when guys are in

4264
02:57:31.72 --> 02:57:36.36
the military here, especially they're young guys in the military, they're, they're, if

4265
02:57:36.36 --> 02:57:40.28
they got a family, they're either having to live on house basing or maybe they go out

4266
02:57:40.28 --> 02:57:41.28
in town.

4267
02:57:41.28 --> 02:57:46.72
And a lot of them are on, on a wick and snapping all that stuff.

4268
02:57:46.72 --> 02:57:51.40
So you have, so when we were raising our kids, and this is a, it's a choice that you can

4269
02:57:51.40 --> 02:57:52.40
make.

4270
02:57:52.40 --> 02:57:54.36
So Sarah was an RN.

4271
02:57:54.36 --> 02:57:57.80
She's an ICU nurse and I was a E four, I guess.

4272
02:57:57.80 --> 02:58:02.12
And we had our second child and I think I made E five by then.

4273
02:58:02.12 --> 02:58:07.28
And we just looked at it and said, Hey, look, her economic earning potential is three times

4274
02:58:07.28 --> 02:58:08.64
what mine was.

4275
02:58:08.64 --> 02:58:14.84
But we said, we have these kids and we chose to invest in the children.

4276
02:58:14.84 --> 02:58:15.84
You know what I mean?

4277
02:58:15.84 --> 02:58:20.80
We stayed at home since we had our second child and we supported ourselves off a single

4278
02:58:20.80 --> 02:58:23.08
enlisted person's salary.

4279
02:58:23.08 --> 02:58:25.64
And we had, what's that?

4280
02:58:25.64 --> 02:58:30.44
It's the wick women, infant and children, you know, like coupons to get milk and all

4281
02:58:30.44 --> 02:58:31.44
that stuff.

4282
02:58:31.44 --> 02:58:33.40
I mean, we were poor.

4283
02:58:33.40 --> 02:58:39.60
But relatively speaking, you know, if you, you, you projected across the globe, we're

4284
02:58:39.60 --> 02:58:41.28
still incredibly wealthy.

4285
02:58:41.28 --> 02:58:44.64
If you look at that in perspective, and I think when the department of the army just

4286
02:58:44.64 --> 02:58:48.76
came on and said, Hey, instead of paying enlisted people more, put them on food stamps.

4287
02:58:48.76 --> 02:58:49.76
That's an issue.

4288
02:58:49.76 --> 02:58:50.76
Yeah.

4289
02:58:50.76 --> 02:58:52.76
Well, that's a way for them to save money in the long run, right?

4290
02:58:52.76 --> 02:58:56.40
Which is not giving them, you're not raising their base pay, which means you don't have

4291
02:58:56.40 --> 02:58:58.80
to pay the retirement as much.

4292
02:58:58.80 --> 02:59:03.32
But Echo, what was your point in saying that like it's making the comparison, but you make

4293
02:59:03.32 --> 02:59:09.60
a good point too, because, and this was actually kind of maybe a few years after that, I remember

4294
02:59:09.60 --> 02:59:16.64
I had a roommate too though, but my portion of the rent was like 450 bucks or something.

4295
02:59:16.64 --> 02:59:20.000
And I was making like 300 bucks every two weeks.

4296
02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.24
So I was making like 600 bucks.

4297
02:59:22.24 --> 02:59:23.84
Where was this here?

4298
02:59:23.84 --> 02:59:26.88
You know, I, you know, I, you were living large.

4299
02:59:26.88 --> 02:59:29.48
So your point is, were you moving, moving company?

4300
02:59:29.48 --> 02:59:31.96
No, no, no, no, moving company for my first summer job.

4301
02:59:31.96 --> 02:59:33.32
But you made good money moving, right?

4302
02:59:33.32 --> 02:59:36.28
I was a part time bouncer at that time.

4303
02:59:36.28 --> 02:59:38.84
You ain't going to make a bunch of money for being a part time bouncer.

4304
02:59:38.84 --> 02:59:42.56
No, no, no, no, no, I'm just making the comparison with like how much you can make versus what

4305
02:59:42.56 --> 02:59:45.96
you can kind of live off of and have your own apartment or whatever.

4306
02:59:45.96 --> 02:59:46.96
And you know what?

4307
02:59:46.96 --> 02:59:47.96
I'm biased.

4308
02:59:47.96 --> 02:59:51.96
That's why, because I'm like, I look at like the apartment rent right now and it's like

4309
02:59:51.96 --> 02:59:57.32
3,000, 3,500, 4,000, 4,300 is what I'm hearing.

4310
02:59:57.32 --> 02:59:58.32
You're saying it's San Diego.

4311
02:59:58.32 --> 02:59:59.32
Yeah, exactly right.

4312
02:59:59.32 --> 03:00:00.32
San Diego and in UTC.

4313
03:00:00.32 --> 03:00:01.32
Yeah, calm man.

4314
03:00:01.32 --> 03:00:06.16
There's places in even in San Diego, which is super expensive.

4315
03:00:06.16 --> 03:00:08.48
There's places that are way cheaper than that.

4316
03:00:08.48 --> 03:00:13.08
In fact, I would actually even say most places are going to be way cheaper than that.

4317
03:00:13.08 --> 03:00:14.08
Definitely.

4318
03:00:14.08 --> 03:00:17.36
In all of probably California really when you think about, I mean there's certain designated

4319
03:00:17.36 --> 03:00:22.72
cities that's like, okay, it's crazy, but everywhere else is probably a lot cheaper.

4320
03:00:22.72 --> 03:00:26.76
But you make a good point where it's like, yeah, I worked at Chevron, but then even you

4321
03:00:26.76 --> 03:00:28.84
saying like, oh yeah, you're starving.

4322
03:00:28.84 --> 03:00:31.000
It's kind of like, okay, there, that's kind of the deal.

4323
03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:32.68
No one's really starving now.

4324
03:00:32.68 --> 03:00:35.32
You know, everyone's got their phone and they got their this.

4325
03:00:35.32 --> 03:00:37.60
I'm thankful that people are not hungry.

4326
03:00:37.60 --> 03:00:40.32
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fully, but that's a whole different thing though.

4327
03:00:40.32 --> 03:00:44.04
Then as far as like what I was kind of trying to compare.

4328
03:00:44.04 --> 03:00:45.72
But I don't think we're way off.

4329
03:00:45.72 --> 03:00:47.44
I think, I think it's kind of similar now.

4330
03:00:47.44 --> 03:00:50.44
I think just now we're just distracted by way more things.

4331
03:00:50.44 --> 03:00:55.76
But you also got to look at what you're going to accept and what you're going to do about

4332
03:00:55.76 --> 03:00:56.76
it.

4333
03:00:56.76 --> 03:01:03.000
Because I was in Iraq, we hit this target building and we roll in there and there's

4334
03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:06.56
a family, whatever live in there and there's a bad guy and we got the bad guy and we're

4335
03:01:06.56 --> 03:01:08.44
now we're like looking at this place where it lives.

4336
03:01:08.44 --> 03:01:16.64
And in the, it was basically one big room and then like two smaller sleeping rooms.

4337
03:01:16.64 --> 03:01:20.84
But in the one big room, there was the kitchen where they made the food and then there was

4338
03:01:20.84 --> 03:01:25.000
like a, there was like a sink to make, to do dishes.

4339
03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:26.000
It was the kitchen.

4340
03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:31.52
Then there was a small bench or table to prep the food and then right next to that was the

4341
03:01:31.52 --> 03:01:32.52
shitter.

4342
03:01:32.52 --> 03:01:34.28
It was like, it wasn't, it wasn't a toilet.

4343
03:01:34.28 --> 03:01:38.40
It was a trough that had a little hole that you would shit right there.

4344
03:01:38.40 --> 03:01:42.56
And these things were separated by no more than five feet.

4345
03:01:42.56 --> 03:01:47.20
If I moved in there within 30 seconds, I'd be assessing how we're going to do this different.

4346
03:01:47.20 --> 03:01:48.72
What change we're going to make, we're going to make this thing better.

4347
03:01:48.72 --> 03:01:50.52
We're not going to, we're not going to shit where we eat.

4348
03:01:50.52 --> 03:01:51.52
That's just a general rule.

4349
03:01:51.52 --> 03:01:52.52
We're going to make change.

4350
03:01:52.52 --> 03:01:55.28
Now this family had been living there for a long time.

4351
03:01:55.28 --> 03:01:59.88
And I noticed that wherever we would go, there would be some guys in the platoon that would

4352
03:01:59.88 --> 03:02:01.44
be like, oh, we're moving into this building now.

4353
03:02:01.44 --> 03:02:02.44
Cool.

4354
03:02:02.44 --> 03:02:03.44
Here's what I'm going to do.

4355
03:02:03.44 --> 03:02:04.44
They would make it work.

4356
03:02:04.44 --> 03:02:05.44
They would make it work.

4357
03:02:05.44 --> 03:02:06.44
They would make it work.

4358
03:02:06.44 --> 03:02:07.44
They would make it work.

4359
03:02:07.44 --> 03:02:08.44
And they would start making stuff.

4360
03:02:08.44 --> 03:02:09.44
They'd start building stuff.

4361
03:02:09.44 --> 03:02:10.44
They'd get everything set up.

4362
03:02:10.44 --> 03:02:11.44
They'd get a fan from somewhere.

4363
03:02:11.44 --> 03:02:12.44
They'd rig that.

4364
03:02:12.44 --> 03:02:13.44
They'd make it work.

4365
03:02:13.44 --> 03:02:14.44
Guys would just take action to improve their situation that they're in.

4366
03:02:14.44 --> 03:02:15.64
And some people aren't.

4367
03:02:15.64 --> 03:02:20.92
So if you're in an apartment and you're working at Chevron and you're starving, you go, hey,

4368
03:02:20.92 --> 03:02:21.92
you know what?

4369
03:02:21.92 --> 03:02:22.92
This sucks.

4370
03:02:22.92 --> 03:02:23.92
I think this sucks.

4371
03:02:23.92 --> 03:02:28.72
I'm going to go and see what the U.S. military, if there's an opportunity for me there.

4372
03:02:28.72 --> 03:02:29.72
That's Derek.

4373
03:02:29.72 --> 03:02:31.56
You know, I'm working at Wendy's.

4374
03:02:31.56 --> 03:02:32.56
Guess what?

4375
03:02:32.56 --> 03:02:33.56
This sucks.

4376
03:02:33.56 --> 03:02:35.12
It sucks working at Wendy's.

4377
03:02:35.12 --> 03:02:37.000
They have these fantastic potato wedges.

4378
03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:38.000
Oh, believe me.

4379
03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:39.000
I'm not knocking.

4380
03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:42.68
I can't say I didn't really dig Wendy's.

4381
03:02:42.68 --> 03:02:45.04
But I'm looking at it going, hey, you know what?

4382
03:02:45.04 --> 03:02:46.04
This sucks.

4383
03:02:46.04 --> 03:02:47.04
I don't want to do this.

4384
03:02:47.04 --> 03:02:48.68
I don't want to do this for a long time.

4385
03:02:48.68 --> 03:02:49.92
I want to find something else.

4386
03:02:49.92 --> 03:02:50.92
Okay.

4387
03:02:50.92 --> 03:02:53.92
What options do they have in the U.S. military for me?

4388
03:02:53.92 --> 03:02:58.56
You and I both kind of look towards the military, but no matter where you're at, you look around

4389
03:02:58.56 --> 03:02:59.56
and go, hey, you know what?

4390
03:02:59.56 --> 03:03:01.52
Where I'm at right now kind of sucks.

4391
03:03:01.52 --> 03:03:04.48
If you're thinking that right now, then you say, okay, why does it suck?

4392
03:03:04.48 --> 03:03:05.84
What do I need to do to improve it?

4393
03:03:05.84 --> 03:03:07.24
How can I start building in the right direction?

4394
03:03:07.24 --> 03:03:15.40
But you know, when we looked at how things were being manufactured, the only way to manufacture

4395
03:03:15.40 --> 03:03:16.56
something is do it over scenes.

4396
03:03:16.56 --> 03:03:17.56
That sucks.

4397
03:03:17.56 --> 03:03:18.56
Right.

4398
03:03:18.56 --> 03:03:20.76
And my business partner Pete said, that sucks.

4399
03:03:20.76 --> 03:03:22.08
I want to make stuff in America.

4400
03:03:22.08 --> 03:03:25.36
Had to go and find a freaking loom and pull it out of an abandoned factory and get that

4401
03:03:25.36 --> 03:03:27.56
thing working again and find people that knew how to work it.

4402
03:03:27.56 --> 03:03:28.56
Why?

4403
03:03:28.56 --> 03:03:30.72
Because it sucked and we're going to do something about it.

4404
03:03:30.72 --> 03:03:35.56
It sucks that we couldn't get boots that we wanted that were made in America.

4405
03:03:35.56 --> 03:03:36.56
Cool.

4406
03:03:36.56 --> 03:03:37.56
That sucks.

4407
03:03:37.56 --> 03:03:38.56
What are we going to do about it?

4408
03:03:38.56 --> 03:03:43.16
So if you're in a situation that sucks, don't just sit there and grovel in it.

4409
03:03:43.16 --> 03:03:46.72
Figure out what you can do to make some adjustments and listen.

4410
03:03:46.72 --> 03:03:48.28
Are there hard times that hit people?

4411
03:03:48.28 --> 03:03:49.28
Yeah.

4412
03:03:49.28 --> 03:03:53.56
You know, that's a classic extreme ownership question that I'll get.

4413
03:03:53.56 --> 03:03:57.20
Hey, I've been hit with this disease, been hit with cancer.

4414
03:03:57.20 --> 03:03:59.12
I mean, I remember distinctly.

4415
03:03:59.12 --> 03:04:03.56
I got asked this question at a live event.

4416
03:04:03.56 --> 03:04:07.96
Woman said, you know, my, my, my child was a daughter, daughter has cancer.

4417
03:04:07.96 --> 03:04:09.36
How can I take ownership of that?

4418
03:04:09.36 --> 03:04:11.000
What am I supposed to do?

4419
03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:12.000
How am I supposed to take ownership of?

4420
03:04:12.000 --> 03:04:13.000
How is that my fault?

4421
03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:14.76
And I said, no, it's not your fault.

4422
03:04:14.76 --> 03:04:18.32
Obviously that your child got cancer.

4423
03:04:18.32 --> 03:04:20.96
What you take ownership of is how you respond to it.

4424
03:04:20.96 --> 03:04:21.96
Right.

4425
03:04:21.96 --> 03:04:25.28
So, so I see what you're saying.

4426
03:04:25.28 --> 03:04:34.44
So here is the, the, the nexus of personal responsibility and governmental control.

4427
03:04:34.44 --> 03:04:39.16
So the government's job is to make sure that the playing field is level.

4428
03:04:39.16 --> 03:04:46.68
And also we've gotten to the point where we seem to have demonized labor.

4429
03:04:46.68 --> 03:04:50.52
So we have to not take away the dignity of labor.

4430
03:04:50.52 --> 03:04:51.52
You know what I mean?

4431
03:04:51.52 --> 03:04:53.24
Like I have a picture on my phone.

4432
03:04:53.24 --> 03:04:57.44
I'm handing a young guy named Joey his first paycheck of his life.

4433
03:04:57.44 --> 03:04:59.48
You know what I mean?

4434
03:04:59.48 --> 03:05:02.56
He'll remember that 250 bucks the rest of his life.

4435
03:05:02.56 --> 03:05:06.36
Raleigh Bevan's handed me my first check at a movie theater.

4436
03:05:06.36 --> 03:05:07.36
I remember that.

4437
03:05:07.36 --> 03:05:08.76
I remember the guy's name.

4438
03:05:08.76 --> 03:05:10.84
That was 50 years ago when I ran up.

4439
03:05:10.84 --> 03:05:12.04
No, 50 on 53.

4440
03:05:12.04 --> 03:05:14.04
So 35 years, 40 years, whatever it is.

4441
03:05:14.04 --> 03:05:15.04
I don't know.

4442
03:05:15.04 --> 03:05:16.04
Right.

4443
03:05:16.04 --> 03:05:18.04
So I remember Raleigh Bevan's doing that.

4444
03:05:18.04 --> 03:05:22.16
So what is taking place in the United States of America is that for some reason we've allowed

4445
03:05:22.16 --> 03:05:28.60
these folks to convince people that if you work with your hands, you're lower and you're

4446
03:05:28.60 --> 03:05:29.60
lesser.

4447
03:05:29.60 --> 03:05:35.68
So even for some people, they're okay with their circumstances by working at Wendy's.

4448
03:05:35.68 --> 03:05:39.12
And we have to understand that it's okay if that's what you're going to do.

4449
03:05:39.12 --> 03:05:44.000
But then again, if you want something more, that's the part where you've got to look inside.

4450
03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:45.96
And I think that's what you're articulating.

4451
03:05:45.96 --> 03:05:50.56
If you're not happy with your circumstance and the level or the playing field is level

4452
03:05:50.56 --> 03:05:55.76
because the government is set conditions for everybody level and you're living in a place

4453
03:05:55.76 --> 03:06:00.20
where you don't want to be, it's up to you to facilitate that change.

4454
03:06:00.20 --> 03:06:01.20
Yeah.

4455
03:06:01.20 --> 03:06:02.20
Well, of course there's people.

4456
03:06:02.20 --> 03:06:03.20
That's another leadership question I could ask.

4457
03:06:03.20 --> 03:06:07.84
You know, I got Fred and Fred, he comes to work from nine to five, but he's not motivated

4458
03:06:07.84 --> 03:06:08.84
to do anything else.

4459
03:06:08.84 --> 03:06:09.84
He's perfectly fine.

4460
03:06:09.84 --> 03:06:10.84
Just just work.

4461
03:06:10.84 --> 03:06:15.04
And I said, oh, you've got a great person then that's satisfied with where they're at.

4462
03:06:15.04 --> 03:06:16.24
They're doing their job every day.

4463
03:06:16.24 --> 03:06:17.24
They're working hard.

4464
03:06:17.24 --> 03:06:20.12
It doesn't mean turn their turn your back on them and think, well, I'm never going to

4465
03:06:20.12 --> 03:06:21.12
pay attention to Fred again.

4466
03:06:21.12 --> 03:06:24.92
No, it means every six months you check in with Fred and you say, hey, Fred, I know

4467
03:06:24.92 --> 03:06:29.52
you're waiting for kids to get through middle school or you're going to a lot of their games.

4468
03:06:29.52 --> 03:06:33.48
Now that your kid left middle school, are you thinking about maybe moving into a leadership

4469
03:06:33.48 --> 03:06:34.48
position?

4470
03:06:34.48 --> 03:06:35.48
No, I want to wait until they're done with high school.

4471
03:06:35.48 --> 03:06:36.48
Hey, cool.

4472
03:06:36.48 --> 03:06:37.48
No problem.

4473
03:06:37.48 --> 03:06:38.48
I appreciate the work you're doing.

4474
03:06:38.48 --> 03:06:41.52
Are you familiar with the concept of the regimental corporal?

4475
03:06:41.52 --> 03:06:42.76
Speak to me on the regimental corporal.

4476
03:06:42.76 --> 03:06:43.76
All right.

4477
03:06:43.76 --> 03:06:46.32
So in the British Army, they have something that's called the regimental corporal.

4478
03:06:46.32 --> 03:06:49.08
Like in the American military, you have to promote, promote, promote.

4479
03:06:49.08 --> 03:06:50.08
Oh yeah.

4480
03:06:50.08 --> 03:06:51.88
So they have people that are corporals.

4481
03:06:51.88 --> 03:06:52.88
Yeah.

4482
03:06:52.88 --> 03:06:53.88
For life.

4483
03:06:53.88 --> 03:06:54.88
Right.

4484
03:06:54.88 --> 03:06:55.88
For their career.

4485
03:06:55.88 --> 03:06:59.44
They are the best weapons technician in the world and they really want to do that.

4486
03:06:59.44 --> 03:07:00.52
You know what I mean?

4487
03:07:00.52 --> 03:07:05.20
And that's, it's not the English dream, clearly, but that's where that guy wants to be.

4488
03:07:05.20 --> 03:07:09.24
So the beauty of the United States of America, and we got to get back this because we're

4489
03:07:09.24 --> 03:07:14.28
getting away from it, is when you work yourself into a place where you're content, it's okay

4490
03:07:14.28 --> 03:07:15.28
to be content.

4491
03:07:15.28 --> 03:07:18.80
I mean, it's nice to be content, not complacent.

4492
03:07:18.80 --> 03:07:19.88
There's a difference.

4493
03:07:19.88 --> 03:07:24.24
So when you're content with your family situation, your school and your job and all that stuff,

4494
03:07:24.24 --> 03:07:25.24
that's awesome.

4495
03:07:25.24 --> 03:07:26.24
That's your American dream, man.

4496
03:07:26.24 --> 03:07:28.76
You don't, you don't have to have a mansion in Beverly Hills.

4497
03:07:28.76 --> 03:07:30.20
We've been just fooled.

4498
03:07:30.20 --> 03:07:36.88
I have guys that tag me in social media of like plumbing installs that are super freaking

4499
03:07:36.88 --> 03:07:41.32
dialed or they're putting an electrical subpanel and everything is squared away and they're

4500
03:07:41.32 --> 03:07:42.32
like, yeah, check it out.

4501
03:07:42.32 --> 03:07:43.32
Check it out.

4502
03:07:43.32 --> 03:07:44.32
Hell yeah.

4503
03:07:44.32 --> 03:07:45.32
Absolutely 100%.

4504
03:07:45.32 --> 03:07:46.32
That's a trade.

4505
03:07:46.32 --> 03:07:47.32
That's a skill.

4506
03:07:47.32 --> 03:07:48.32
And that's awesome.

4507
03:07:48.32 --> 03:07:50.80
I'm super stoked when I see that stuff.

4508
03:07:50.80 --> 03:07:56.20
And that's again, one thing I'm very lucky is that, you know, I work with my consulting

4509
03:07:56.20 --> 03:08:01.16
company, Ashland Front, we work with companies all over the country and all over the world.

4510
03:08:01.16 --> 03:08:09.60
And so I get to travel into wherever North Dakota and go out and check out the oil rigs

4511
03:08:09.60 --> 03:08:10.60
that are being drilled.

4512
03:08:10.60 --> 03:08:13.24
The drill is the guys working, what they're doing.

4513
03:08:13.24 --> 03:08:14.88
Those freaking guys are awesome.

4514
03:08:14.88 --> 03:08:19.96
The linemen up in Michigan, you know, hanging wires, going through Wisconsin, yeah, in

4515
03:08:19.96 --> 03:08:22.04
Wisconsin all over.

4516
03:08:22.04 --> 03:08:24.16
And these people are skilled.

4517
03:08:24.16 --> 03:08:26.20
They've got a badass job.

4518
03:08:26.20 --> 03:08:28.56
They know that their job is completely me.

4519
03:08:28.56 --> 03:08:33.92
They literally supply power to the country.

4520
03:08:33.92 --> 03:08:34.92
Freaking outstanding.

4521
03:08:34.92 --> 03:08:36.76
So linemen, right?

4522
03:08:36.76 --> 03:08:41.44
I'm going around right off the Great River Road, Highway 35 goes along the Mississippi.

4523
03:08:41.44 --> 03:08:45.80
I'll have the largest contiguous section of the Mississippi River of any congressional

4524
03:08:45.80 --> 03:08:46.80
district in the country.

4525
03:08:46.80 --> 03:08:47.80
Boom.

4526
03:08:47.80 --> 03:08:48.80
It's beautiful.

4527
03:08:48.80 --> 03:08:51.88
See this great house on a corner.

4528
03:08:51.88 --> 03:08:52.88
Big garage.

4529
03:08:52.88 --> 03:08:57.16
It's like a three story place truck in the driveway.

4530
03:08:57.16 --> 03:09:02.16
This new pontoon boat with like a 250 horsepower motor or something outboard, you know, cost

4531
03:09:02.16 --> 03:09:04.04
more than my truck.

4532
03:09:04.04 --> 03:09:06.68
And so I whip in there because I want to put a yard sign in this guy.

4533
03:09:06.68 --> 03:09:10.92
I go, Hey man, do you mind me asking what you do for a living?

4534
03:09:10.92 --> 03:09:18.92
I went to trade school for two years and he had two kids and I can't remember his wife's

4535
03:09:18.92 --> 03:09:20.76
name for Pete six.

4536
03:09:20.76 --> 03:09:26.52
She was a radiology technician, not a radiologist, but she, okay, she went to trade school.

4537
03:09:26.52 --> 03:09:30.16
So you got these two people went to trade school, graduated from high school and they're

4538
03:09:30.16 --> 03:09:31.16
balling dude.

4539
03:09:31.16 --> 03:09:33.56
I mean, they're living their American dream.

4540
03:09:33.56 --> 03:09:38.04
They've got their kids in school and I'm like, why is that wrong?

4541
03:09:38.04 --> 03:09:45.76
And you, you can't fix a toilet with the degree in 13th century French poetry and you just

4542
03:09:45.76 --> 03:09:47.12
can't.

4543
03:09:47.12 --> 03:09:51.20
So why have we demonized the things that built this nation?

4544
03:09:51.20 --> 03:09:52.20
You know what I mean?

4545
03:09:52.20 --> 03:09:56.72
You, you can't, you can't pump the air conditioning in this room.

4546
03:09:56.72 --> 03:10:00.20
If you have a degree in communications, you gotta be a metal worker.

4547
03:10:00.20 --> 03:10:01.20
You know what I mean?

4548
03:10:01.20 --> 03:10:03.60
You have to be a sheet metal worker to make ducting.

4549
03:10:03.60 --> 03:10:08.84
So one of the things that I'm doing Chaco is I consider myself and I think that the

4550
03:10:08.84 --> 03:10:12.80
federal government needs to do more cheerleading like we have to cheerlead.

4551
03:10:12.80 --> 03:10:17.88
I did a, I got endorsed by 16 in the 19 sheriffs of my district.

4552
03:10:17.88 --> 03:10:19.000
You know what I mean?

4553
03:10:19.000 --> 03:10:21.20
Because they know I have their back 100%.

4554
03:10:21.20 --> 03:10:23.12
I, I've lived in ungoverned space.

4555
03:10:23.12 --> 03:10:25.40
I'm unwilling to do that in the United States.

4556
03:10:25.40 --> 03:10:26.40
How do you prevent that?

4557
03:10:26.40 --> 03:10:28.04
You support the police officers.

4558
03:10:28.04 --> 03:10:29.56
That's what you do, right?

4559
03:10:29.56 --> 03:10:37.56
So I'm, I'm all in with these guys all the time and I'm also all in with people that

4560
03:10:37.56 --> 03:10:39.04
are going to trade school.

4561
03:10:39.04 --> 03:10:44.20
So we have to have people in positions of power go, it is so awesome that you are protecting

4562
03:10:44.20 --> 03:10:46.60
me when I say, I tell them this, okay dude.

4563
03:10:46.60 --> 03:10:48.84
So I'm a Christian.

4564
03:10:48.84 --> 03:10:52.56
I was never afraid of being injured or killed.

4565
03:10:52.56 --> 03:10:55.08
It was not part of my calculation.

4566
03:10:55.08 --> 03:10:56.08
You know what I mean?

4567
03:10:56.08 --> 03:10:58.92
I, for me, I've read the end of the book, seen the end of the movie.

4568
03:10:58.92 --> 03:10:59.92
I know what happens.

4569
03:10:59.92 --> 03:11:05.96
Even I used to joke, you know, with my wife about this and it was just kind of, she's

4570
03:11:05.96 --> 03:11:06.96
a frog.

4571
03:11:06.96 --> 03:11:07.96
Real funny.

4572
03:11:07.96 --> 03:11:08.96
Well, she's a frog.

4573
03:11:08.96 --> 03:11:09.96
No, she's a frog man's wife.

4574
03:11:09.96 --> 03:11:10.96
You know what I mean?

4575
03:11:10.96 --> 03:11:13.80
So I was never worried about that.

4576
03:11:13.80 --> 03:11:16.20
What I was worried about was my family.

4577
03:11:16.20 --> 03:11:17.80
You know what I mean?

4578
03:11:17.80 --> 03:11:23.04
I was worried about my family and the most precious gift you can have from my personal

4579
03:11:23.04 --> 03:11:29.88
experience in a combat environment is like a two hour nap, right?

4580
03:11:29.88 --> 03:11:32.88
You get two hours of sleep when things are squarely.

4581
03:11:32.88 --> 03:11:35.56
Why can you get that two hour nap?

4582
03:11:35.56 --> 03:11:39.76
Because your brothers have guns and they're looking out and they're protecting you in

4583
03:11:39.76 --> 03:11:41.48
your sleep.

4584
03:11:41.48 --> 03:11:43.76
That's something I cherished and I still do.

4585
03:11:43.76 --> 03:11:45.48
Who does that for my family?

4586
03:11:45.48 --> 03:11:47.24
Police officers.

4587
03:11:47.24 --> 03:11:48.64
That's a gift.

4588
03:11:48.64 --> 03:11:52.56
And when people are demonizing them, they just don't understand that.

4589
03:11:52.56 --> 03:11:57.32
These people are literally watching your children as they sleep to make sure they're not harmed.

4590
03:11:57.32 --> 03:11:59.84
What is more honorable than that and noble?

4591
03:11:59.84 --> 03:12:00.84
I don't know.

4592
03:12:00.84 --> 03:12:01.84
Yeah.

4593
03:12:01.84 --> 03:12:02.84
Yeah.

4594
03:12:02.84 --> 03:12:04.76
Same thing with the guys and gals that are building our country.

4595
03:12:04.76 --> 03:12:05.76
Yeah.

4596
03:12:05.76 --> 03:12:07.72
Same thing when you flip on that electrical switch.

4597
03:12:07.72 --> 03:12:12.60
Honorable and it's noble and things don't work without that.

4598
03:12:12.60 --> 03:12:15.60
So the federal government needs to cheerlead.

4599
03:12:15.60 --> 03:12:19.72
We need to tell people you're not, you're only here because these people are working

4600
03:12:19.72 --> 03:12:21.44
so hard.

4601
03:12:21.44 --> 03:12:23.16
That's why you could drive your car to work.

4602
03:12:23.16 --> 03:12:24.16
That's why you're eating.

4603
03:12:24.16 --> 03:12:26.56
That's why you have clothes.

4604
03:12:26.56 --> 03:12:30.000
These are things that don't take these fancy pants degrees.

4605
03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:31.000
I don't have an issue.

4606
03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:32.72
I mean, I went to law school.

4607
03:12:32.72 --> 03:12:34.04
You know what I mean?

4608
03:12:34.04 --> 03:12:35.04
I get it.

4609
03:12:35.04 --> 03:12:36.04
Higher education is very important.

4610
03:12:36.04 --> 03:12:37.04
Graduate degrees are important.

4611
03:12:37.04 --> 03:12:41.000
By the way, I finished my first year of law school and did full time congress.

4612
03:12:41.000 --> 03:12:43.16
So I'm technically not a sabbatical.

4613
03:12:43.16 --> 03:12:44.16
Which I'm...

4614
03:12:44.16 --> 03:12:47.16
You may or may not get back to.

4615
03:12:47.16 --> 03:12:51.72
Well, I'm going to have a greater positive effect writing laws than I will interpreting

4616
03:12:51.72 --> 03:12:52.72
them.

4617
03:12:52.72 --> 03:12:53.72
And again, I got into that.

4618
03:12:53.72 --> 03:12:58.52
I went to that for intellectual curiosity, not to be perry-mason or something like that.

4619
03:12:58.52 --> 03:13:00.60
Anyway, so that's the next thing I'm doing.

4620
03:13:00.60 --> 03:13:01.60
Cheerleading.

4621
03:13:01.60 --> 03:13:02.60
Check.

4622
03:13:02.60 --> 03:13:03.60
Was that the only question?

4623
03:13:03.60 --> 03:13:04.60
That was the only one.

4624
03:13:04.60 --> 03:13:05.60
That's the only one.

4625
03:13:05.60 --> 03:13:06.60
I was trying to make a comparison.

4626
03:13:06.60 --> 03:13:07.60
Just drawing a comparison.

4627
03:13:07.60 --> 03:13:08.60
Dude, you got to test him a little bit.

4628
03:13:08.60 --> 03:13:12.72
You know, he's going to be up against the big dogs, the big tough questions.

4629
03:13:12.72 --> 03:13:13.72
That's it for right now.

4630
03:13:13.72 --> 03:13:14.72
How about that?

4631
03:13:14.72 --> 03:13:15.72
Okay.

4632
03:13:15.72 --> 03:13:16.72
Right on.

4633
03:13:16.72 --> 03:13:17.72
Okay.

4634
03:13:17.72 --> 03:13:24.60
Um, gosh, I, uh, I, again, I want people to be encouraged.

4635
03:13:24.60 --> 03:13:31.64
And you know, how are you encouraged is you, you sit down and you, you practice, actively

4636
03:13:31.64 --> 03:13:35.54
practice gratitude for what you got.

4637
03:13:35.54 --> 03:13:41.16
And you understand that you are empowered to change your circumstances.

4638
03:13:41.16 --> 03:13:48.68
And I know that because I was raised dirt poor in a single home, high school dropout,

4639
03:13:48.68 --> 03:13:49.68
the whole works in jerks.

4640
03:13:49.68 --> 03:13:50.88
I'm going to Congress next year.

4641
03:13:50.88 --> 03:13:54.64
So if I can do this, you can do it.

4642
03:13:54.64 --> 03:13:55.64
It's the same.

4643
03:13:55.64 --> 03:13:59.56
I told you, man, I knew I could graduate from Bud's because there is a seal with a trident

4644
03:13:59.56 --> 03:14:01.92
on in front of me.

4645
03:14:01.92 --> 03:14:02.92
Right?

4646
03:14:02.92 --> 03:14:03.92
Yeah.

4647
03:14:03.92 --> 03:14:05.48
Means it's possible.

4648
03:14:05.48 --> 03:14:06.48
So act.

4649
03:14:06.48 --> 03:14:07.48
Right?

4650
03:14:07.48 --> 03:14:10.68
It is possible.

4651
03:14:10.68 --> 03:14:11.68
So act.

4652
03:14:11.68 --> 03:14:13.32
Awesome words to close on.

4653
03:14:13.32 --> 03:14:15.44
Thanks for joining us, brother.

4654
03:14:15.44 --> 03:14:16.44
Thanks for your service.

4655
03:14:16.44 --> 03:14:17.44
Well, thank you for yours.

4656
03:14:17.44 --> 03:14:19.28
That code's really nice to meet you, man.

4657
03:14:19.28 --> 03:14:20.28
Likewise.

4658
03:14:20.28 --> 03:14:21.28
I'll give you my phone number.

4659
03:14:21.28 --> 03:14:22.28
You can call me.

4660
03:14:22.28 --> 03:14:23.28
I think you already got it.

4661
03:14:23.28 --> 03:14:25.68
Well, God bless you guys and your listeners.

4662
03:14:25.68 --> 03:14:27.68
And I just wish you the best.

4663
03:14:27.68 --> 03:14:29.36
Oh, hey, where's that thing?

4664
03:14:29.36 --> 03:14:30.68
Oh, we got a baseball bat.

4665
03:14:30.68 --> 03:14:31.68
Check this out.

4666
03:14:31.68 --> 03:14:39.88
So this, this was made by the three brothers back company.

4667
03:14:39.88 --> 03:14:42.12
This is in Wisconsin.

4668
03:14:42.12 --> 03:14:43.12
Got ahold of these guys.

4669
03:14:43.12 --> 03:14:44.76
A couple of played college balls.

4670
03:14:44.76 --> 03:14:52.68
It's actually four brothers and a sister, but they decided to start making baseball bats.

4671
03:14:52.68 --> 03:14:59.04
So this bat is, it meets all the standards to be used in major league baseball.

4672
03:14:59.04 --> 03:15:01.76
And these dudes have bought the Seoul building and started making these things.

4673
03:15:01.76 --> 03:15:02.76
Yeah.

4674
03:15:02.76 --> 03:15:07.16
So what happened with bats is I did like a, okay, long story on the bats.

4675
03:15:07.16 --> 03:15:14.40
Here's the long story on the bats when I went to Iraq, platoon commander 2003.

4676
03:15:14.40 --> 03:15:16.56
When did you go there for the first time?

4677
03:15:16.56 --> 03:15:17.56
2004.

4678
03:15:17.56 --> 03:15:19.28
I was in Afghanistan in 2003.

4679
03:15:19.28 --> 03:15:20.36
I was in Iraq in 2005.

4680
03:15:20.36 --> 03:15:25.80
When you were in Afghanistan in 2003 was America sending a bunch of stuff over there just like

4681
03:15:25.80 --> 03:15:28.48
care packages and like sunscreen.

4682
03:15:28.48 --> 03:15:29.48
Still are.

4683
03:15:29.48 --> 03:15:30.48
Okay.

4684
03:15:30.48 --> 03:15:31.48
So that was going on.

4685
03:15:31.48 --> 03:15:36.12
And for whatever reason, you know, the sun screen and like M&M just all this stuff and

4686
03:15:36.12 --> 03:15:41.88
they would send baseball gloves and baseballs and baseball bats.

4687
03:15:41.88 --> 03:15:44.92
So for whatever reason, we had a bunch of baseball bats.

4688
03:15:44.92 --> 03:15:48.48
So we're living in a, you know, this was 2003.

4689
03:15:48.48 --> 03:15:53.64
The war had kind of, well, this is the fall of 2004, 2003.

4690
03:15:53.64 --> 03:15:54.84
So the war wasn't very deep.

4691
03:15:54.84 --> 03:15:56.04
There wasn't all this infrastructure.

4692
03:15:56.04 --> 03:16:00.28
There wasn't like a Wendy's on the base and everything like this yet.

4693
03:16:00.28 --> 03:16:05.16
And so we were briefing in this crappy room with, you know, like a sheet hung up on the

4694
03:16:05.16 --> 03:16:12.28
wall and I would brief, I would go and get one of the bats from this MWR, the morale

4695
03:16:12.28 --> 03:16:16.56
welfare and recreation bucket, which had three baseball bats in it.

4696
03:16:16.56 --> 03:16:20.52
That somebody, some cool person from America threw them into a package and sent them to

4697
03:16:20.52 --> 03:16:23.08
support the troops, which is beautiful.

4698
03:16:23.08 --> 03:16:26.20
And so I would walk over there, grab a bat and that's how I'd brief.

4699
03:16:26.20 --> 03:16:30.68
And one of my friends has a, has a video of me briefing with the bat.

4700
03:16:30.68 --> 03:16:33.40
And you know, that's just like how I would point to like, Hey, we're going to go in

4701
03:16:33.40 --> 03:16:35.48
over here, we're going to move over there.

4702
03:16:35.48 --> 03:16:40.80
And so then when I was a task unit commander, it kind of continued on that we had like a

4703
03:16:40.80 --> 03:16:42.48
briefing bat.

4704
03:16:42.48 --> 03:16:45.36
And then we did a video the other day and I was just like talking about leadership or

4705
03:16:45.36 --> 03:16:46.36
something.

4706
03:16:46.36 --> 03:16:48.52
I was holding a bat and I forget what bat it was.

4707
03:16:48.52 --> 03:16:49.52
It'll be that one in the future.

4708
03:16:49.52 --> 03:16:50.80
Well, in the future, it'll be this one.

4709
03:16:50.80 --> 03:16:56.60
But then now a bunch of people, now I have, I think, I think I've received five baseball

4710
03:16:56.60 --> 03:16:59.44
bats from various people, custom baseball bats.

4711
03:16:59.44 --> 03:17:01.60
I mean, you can see there's another one right over there.

4712
03:17:01.60 --> 03:17:03.36
I got a few of them at home.

4713
03:17:03.36 --> 03:17:05.80
But yeah, this one is, this one's awesome.

4714
03:17:05.80 --> 03:17:06.92
Made in America.

4715
03:17:06.92 --> 03:17:11.04
It says deaf core pro model deaf 434.

4716
03:17:11.04 --> 03:17:13.16
Three brothers bat company, dude.

4717
03:17:13.16 --> 03:17:14.96
That is in my district.

4718
03:17:14.96 --> 03:17:20.000
And that is another example of people saying I have got a good idea.

4719
03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:22.88
There's, I'll tell you one, I got to get out here.

4720
03:17:22.88 --> 03:17:25.92
There's weasel concrete, concrete company.

4721
03:17:25.92 --> 03:17:26.92
Joe just died.

4722
03:17:26.92 --> 03:17:30.16
Gosh, it must have been 16 months ago.

4723
03:17:30.16 --> 03:17:35.44
Joe had like six kids and they had a house and Mary's his wife.

4724
03:17:35.44 --> 03:17:38.52
And he's like, I got an idea.

4725
03:17:38.52 --> 03:17:45.84
I got an idea how to make concrete this certain way to make this stuff and it's going to work.

4726
03:17:45.84 --> 03:17:47.84
Mortgage is his house again.

4727
03:17:47.84 --> 03:17:49.72
So you want to talk about risk?

4728
03:17:49.72 --> 03:17:52.80
Homeless Wisconsin six kids.

4729
03:17:52.80 --> 03:17:53.80
That would happen if you failed.

4730
03:17:53.80 --> 03:17:56.76
But he's like, I have an idea.

4731
03:17:56.76 --> 03:17:58.76
He died a billionaire.

4732
03:17:58.76 --> 03:18:02.000
Yeah, because he was like, I'm sick.

4733
03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:03.000
Check on the billionaire part.

4734
03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:04.000
Not so much to check on the diet part.

4735
03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:07.000
But I mean, if you're going to die, you might as well do it as a billionaire.

4736
03:18:07.000 --> 03:18:08.000
Right.

4737
03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:09.000
Right.

4738
03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:11.40
So the, that's one of the things where people demonize business people.

4739
03:18:11.40 --> 03:18:17.36
I'm like the hardest that I would say the wealthiest people I know are some of the hardest

4740
03:18:17.36 --> 03:18:19.16
working people I know.

4741
03:18:19.16 --> 03:18:20.68
And you know, that's their thing.

4742
03:18:20.68 --> 03:18:21.88
That's their metric.

4743
03:18:21.88 --> 03:18:25.16
As I started off, you know, I still do this.

4744
03:18:25.16 --> 03:18:27.36
I collect relationships with people.

4745
03:18:27.36 --> 03:18:29.40
To me, that is my metric of success.

4746
03:18:29.40 --> 03:18:32.04
How many people do I know at what level do I know them?

4747
03:18:32.04 --> 03:18:33.44
How can I help them?

4748
03:18:33.44 --> 03:18:37.68
Will they reach out to me if they need something and can I facilitate that need?

4749
03:18:37.68 --> 03:18:38.68
That's my metric of success.

4750
03:18:38.68 --> 03:18:39.68
It always has been.

4751
03:18:39.68 --> 03:18:41.92
Sarah Jane, I live on my enlisted retirement.

4752
03:18:41.92 --> 03:18:42.92
You know what I mean?

4753
03:18:42.92 --> 03:18:43.92
Cause we don't chase nickels.

4754
03:18:43.92 --> 03:18:45.96
I just, it's not my thing.

4755
03:18:45.96 --> 03:18:51.88
But if, if that, if you're a businessman, you're metric or woman, you're metric of success

4756
03:18:51.88 --> 03:18:54.36
more likely than not is financial.

4757
03:18:54.36 --> 03:18:59.36
So therefore, if you're doing this and that's the metric of success, you should be wealthy

4758
03:18:59.36 --> 03:19:00.56
as a business person.

4759
03:19:00.56 --> 03:19:03.92
If you're a doctor, you should be carrying people.

4760
03:19:03.92 --> 03:19:10.72
So I'd love that about this job because I get to meet the most fascinating people like

4761
03:19:10.72 --> 03:19:13.000
those dudes that made that bat for you.

4762
03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:14.76
And it was an offhand comment.

4763
03:19:14.76 --> 03:19:17.48
You know this Jocko guy?

4764
03:19:17.48 --> 03:19:20.72
When did you meet him and when did they get the bat to you to bring it hand carry it to

4765
03:19:20.72 --> 03:19:21.72
me?

4766
03:19:21.72 --> 03:19:24.84
I met him right overnight to my mother in law's house.

4767
03:19:24.84 --> 03:19:27.60
It was, it was delivered yesterday.

4768
03:19:27.60 --> 03:19:31.92
So I talked to the cats and they're like, Oh, you know this Jocko willing guy?

4769
03:19:31.92 --> 03:19:35.84
I'm like, you know, and they said it like, you know, cause apparently he's a big deal.

4770
03:19:35.84 --> 03:19:37.36
I mean, I don't know this stuff, dude.

4771
03:19:37.36 --> 03:19:38.36
Like I didn't know he had this.

4772
03:19:38.36 --> 03:19:42.24
I was like, you don't know he has all this stuff because I started looking into it and

4773
03:19:42.24 --> 03:19:43.24
you wrote all these books and everything.

4774
03:19:43.24 --> 03:19:48.68
I go like, if you're going to accountant, you know, would you like go watch a movie about

4775
03:19:48.68 --> 03:19:50.72
tax season or, you know, you wouldn't.

4776
03:19:50.72 --> 03:19:52.76
I'm like, so why would I be looking into Jocko?

4777
03:19:52.76 --> 03:19:54.64
I know the dude, he's an awesome cat.

4778
03:19:54.64 --> 03:19:57.16
You know, why would I be following him around?

4779
03:19:57.16 --> 03:20:01.000
So I didn't, but they're like that offhand comment.

4780
03:20:01.000 --> 03:20:05.84
I go, yeah, man, I've known him for like 30 years, I guess now over T one, right?

4781
03:20:05.84 --> 03:20:08.16
And they're like, you are kidding me.

4782
03:20:08.16 --> 03:20:09.20
I'm like, no.

4783
03:20:09.20 --> 03:20:10.84
So they follow your podcast.

4784
03:20:10.84 --> 03:20:11.84
They watch it.

4785
03:20:11.84 --> 03:20:15.52
I think that they've taken a lot of your lessons because they're incredibly squared away dudes

4786
03:20:15.52 --> 03:20:16.72
and families awesome.

4787
03:20:16.72 --> 03:20:17.72
And just their name.

4788
03:20:17.72 --> 03:20:19.96
They have, you know, too many siblings to put it on a bat.

4789
03:20:19.96 --> 03:20:21.60
That's why it's three brothers back company.

4790
03:20:21.60 --> 03:20:25.92
But yeah, so that was made for you and I have one.

4791
03:20:25.92 --> 03:20:32.08
It's in my office, which I think again, cheerleading for people is what that should be a primary

4792
03:20:32.08 --> 03:20:33.08
function of politics.

4793
03:20:33.08 --> 03:20:38.80
I mean, clearly you must write functional policy and translate ideas into action and

4794
03:20:38.80 --> 03:20:41.88
you do that through written word advice again, like we used to do.

4795
03:20:41.88 --> 03:20:46.16
But the rest is just telling telling people about other people.

4796
03:20:46.16 --> 03:20:47.16
You know what I mean?

4797
03:20:47.16 --> 03:20:55.72
If if if I could if I could tell you about all the people that I know and what they've

4798
03:20:55.72 --> 03:21:00.28
done, it would just be an endless conversation.

4799
03:21:00.28 --> 03:21:04.20
And to me, that means I am the most successful person in the world because that's my metric

4800
03:21:04.20 --> 03:21:05.20
of success.

4801
03:21:05.20 --> 03:21:06.20
Check.

4802
03:21:06.20 --> 03:21:07.20
Awesome, man.

4803
03:21:07.20 --> 03:21:10.16
Well, like I said, thanks for coming down.

4804
03:21:10.16 --> 03:21:11.16
Yeah, appreciate it.

4805
03:21:11.16 --> 03:21:13.000
God bless you, man.

4806
03:21:13.000 --> 03:21:16.68
Thanks for thanks for the service of your family, by the way.

4807
03:21:16.68 --> 03:21:24.40
And what the what the military wives and spouses for the bomb go through incredible, the kids

4808
03:21:24.40 --> 03:21:31.20
that grow up, you know, without dads around without moms around, really, really challenging.

4809
03:21:31.20 --> 03:21:32.96
So thanks to your family as well.

4810
03:21:32.96 --> 03:21:34.52
And I'll pass it on.

4811
03:21:34.52 --> 03:21:39.12
I wish you fair wins, fair wins, following seas and a lot of votes.

4812
03:21:39.12 --> 03:21:40.12
There you go.

4813
03:21:40.12 --> 03:21:41.12
Get them.

4814
03:21:41.12 --> 03:21:42.12
All right, bro.

4815
03:21:42.12 --> 03:21:43.12
Thanks.

4816
03:21:43.12 --> 03:21:44.12
Cheers.

4817
03:21:44.12 --> 03:21:45.12
Oh, one more thing.

4818
03:21:45.12 --> 03:21:46.12
I forgot vanordanforcogers.com.

4819
03:21:46.12 --> 03:21:56.76
On Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram, you're at Derek D. E. R. R. I. C. K. Van Orden O. R.

4820
03:21:56.76 --> 03:22:00.24
D. E. N. And you're up on all those different platforms.

4821
03:22:00.24 --> 03:22:01.80
You got a YouTube channel as well.

4822
03:22:01.80 --> 03:22:02.80
I do.

4823
03:22:02.80 --> 03:22:04.36
So we can you can explore.

4824
03:22:04.36 --> 03:22:06.48
You got lots of 30 second clips on there.

4825
03:22:06.48 --> 03:22:08.72
Those are your little ad spots.

4826
03:22:08.72 --> 03:22:09.72
I do those.

4827
03:22:09.72 --> 03:22:12.72
I also make these little videos and just try to explain.

4828
03:22:12.72 --> 03:22:14.52
Where do you put your little videos?

4829
03:22:14.52 --> 03:22:16.64
They go mostly on my social media.

4830
03:22:16.64 --> 03:22:19.64
And then we also rip them over to YouTube.

4831
03:22:19.64 --> 03:22:20.64
So it's all out there.

4832
03:22:20.64 --> 03:22:25.68
If you want to get a feel, a better feel, if over three hours of conversation, if you

4833
03:22:25.68 --> 03:22:29.68
don't think like you feel, feel like you know Derek yet, you want to get to know, you might

4834
03:22:29.68 --> 03:22:31.48
know Derek, do you know Van O?

4835
03:22:31.48 --> 03:22:32.48
Do you know Van O?

4836
03:22:32.48 --> 03:22:33.48
Do you know D. V. O?

4837
03:22:33.48 --> 03:22:34.48
All right.

4838
03:22:34.48 --> 03:22:35.48
D. V. O.

4839
03:22:35.48 --> 03:22:36.48
All right, man.

4840
03:22:36.48 --> 03:22:37.48
Thank you.

4841
03:22:37.48 --> 03:22:38.48
You bet.

4842
03:22:38.48 --> 03:22:42.48
And with that, Derek Van Orden, Van O.

4843
03:22:42.48 --> 03:22:43.48
D. V. O.

4844
03:22:43.48 --> 03:22:44.48
D. V. O.

4845
03:22:44.48 --> 03:22:45.48
What's going with?

4846
03:22:45.48 --> 03:22:46.48
Yeah.

4847
03:22:46.48 --> 03:22:47.48
D. V. O.

4848
03:22:47.48 --> 03:22:50.04
D. V. O. has left the building.

4849
03:22:50.04 --> 03:22:55.92
Lot going on in the life of D. V. O.

4850
03:22:55.92 --> 03:23:03.68
Some pretty important themes throughout the talk, the discussion.

4851
03:23:03.68 --> 03:23:06.64
And you know what I just realized?

4852
03:23:06.64 --> 03:23:07.64
He was in that movie.

4853
03:23:07.64 --> 03:23:08.64
Did you know he was in that movie?

4854
03:23:08.64 --> 03:23:11.92
He mentioned it, but then we, and I like pulled him back to talk about something else.

4855
03:23:11.92 --> 03:23:15.96
And then he's using the movie, the movie is called Act of Valor.

4856
03:23:15.96 --> 03:23:16.96
I did not know that.

4857
03:23:16.96 --> 03:23:17.96
Yeah.

4858
03:23:17.96 --> 03:23:19.52
So he was, he played a scene in that movie.

4859
03:23:19.52 --> 03:23:25.24
He was an interrogator and came in and he, it was pretty funny.

4860
03:23:25.24 --> 03:23:32.32
He was kind of like just him, but being super aggressive.

4861
03:23:32.32 --> 03:23:40.28
But yeah, man, what a dedication to jump back into this stuff and get after it.

4862
03:23:40.28 --> 03:23:48.36
But um, hey, with that, appreciate everyone listening, appreciate the support.

4863
03:23:48.36 --> 03:23:50.40
And if you want to support.

4864
03:23:50.40 --> 03:23:51.60
You mentioned something real quick.

4865
03:23:51.60 --> 03:23:52.60
Okay.

4866
03:23:52.60 --> 03:23:53.60
Thank you.

4867
03:23:53.60 --> 03:23:55.88
I was waiting for you to chime in with something or you're just sitting there looking puzzled

4868
03:23:55.88 --> 03:23:56.88
all the time.

4869
03:23:56.88 --> 03:24:00.08
I wasn't looking at the movie actually.

4870
03:24:00.08 --> 03:24:05.000
And him playing himself, not much of a stretch, not a demonstration of range.

4871
03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:07.84
You know, similar to you, you're acting career.

4872
03:24:07.84 --> 03:24:08.84
Yeah.

4873
03:24:08.84 --> 03:24:10.04
Pretty much the exact same thing.

4874
03:24:10.04 --> 03:24:15.28
But you guys did mention something in passing, seemingly insignificant, but it stuck with

4875
03:24:15.28 --> 03:24:16.28
me.

4876
03:24:16.28 --> 03:24:19.64
You're talking about, he talked about the incident where he left his rifle and the

4877
03:24:19.64 --> 03:24:22.20
other car and you know, and he's just has his pistol.

4878
03:24:22.20 --> 03:24:24.92
And you said that's not going to cut it.

4879
03:24:24.92 --> 03:24:25.92
No.

4880
03:24:25.92 --> 03:24:26.92
Okay.

4881
03:24:26.92 --> 03:24:27.92
Why is that?

4882
03:24:27.92 --> 03:24:32.44
I mean, I can kind of maybe understand, but obviously I've never been in a gunfight.

4883
03:24:32.44 --> 03:24:39.72
So what he's talking about is the enemy puts indirect fire on you, which is mortars,

4884
03:24:39.72 --> 03:24:44.88
maybe rockets, rockets aren't really indirect, but, but they basically are, are lobbing bombs

4885
03:24:44.88 --> 03:24:45.88
at you.

4886
03:24:45.88 --> 03:24:49.48
The purpose of them doing that is number one, that could, could be just a singular purpose.

4887
03:24:49.48 --> 03:24:52.64
Hey, we're just going to try and randomly throw some bombs at people and kill whoever

4888
03:24:52.64 --> 03:24:53.92
we can.

4889
03:24:53.92 --> 03:24:58.36
Random mortars, maybe we kill one or two Americans, but they could also do it.

4890
03:24:58.36 --> 03:25:01.68
So when mortars are coming, you have to get, you have to take cover.

4891
03:25:01.68 --> 03:25:04.12
So now we get the enemy can get you to take cover.

4892
03:25:04.12 --> 03:25:11.16
So they drop a couple of mortars while you're hiding, they commence a ground assault either

4893
03:25:11.16 --> 03:25:13.32
with a vehicle born ID.

4894
03:25:13.32 --> 03:25:18.12
That's what they would do in Ramadi was, it was, it was very aggressive.

4895
03:25:18.12 --> 03:25:23.50
They would, they would hit you with indirect fire as the indirect fire is hitting.

4896
03:25:23.50 --> 03:25:27.88
They start laying down machine gun fire as the machine gun fires coming in, then comes

4897
03:25:27.88 --> 03:25:37.000
IDs, vehicle born IDs, and they overran several, several friendly positions in Ramadi by doing

4898
03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:40.16
that horrible.

4899
03:25:40.16 --> 03:25:46.52
So when you, so he gets mortared and he had told the guys like, Hey, when you get mortared,

4900
03:25:46.52 --> 03:25:51.16
give it a second, see what's going on, let it develop and see what's developing.

4901
03:25:51.16 --> 03:25:54.08
But then as soon as it kind of stops, boom, push out perimeter.

4902
03:25:54.08 --> 03:25:58.16
So then if anybody attacks, you can fend them off.

4903
03:25:58.16 --> 03:26:05.36
So he's pushing out to set perimeter and all he has is a pistol.

4904
03:26:05.36 --> 03:26:08.80
The pistol is not a good weapon for a gunfight.

4905
03:26:08.80 --> 03:26:13.48
So, and that's really the part that I was wondering, like, it's, I feel like I understand

4906
03:26:13.48 --> 03:26:17.56
it kind of, but the way I've heard you say it, and my friend Jeremy, he mentioned this

4907
03:26:17.56 --> 03:26:21.72
one time we're talking, he was like, yeah, a pistol is no match for a rifle.

4908
03:26:21.72 --> 03:26:24.56
I'm like, okay, see how you say it's not even close, like, why is that?

4909
03:26:24.56 --> 03:26:27.32
Cause they're a rifle, you can just aim it better.

4910
03:26:27.32 --> 03:26:31.60
You know, the range is, the range is 10 times as much.

4911
03:26:31.60 --> 03:26:38.60
Yeah, like, like sure, you can shoot someone in kind of at 50 yards with a, with a pistol.

4912
03:26:38.60 --> 03:26:42.04
If you're really, really good, anyone, just about anyone can pick up a rifle and shoot

4913
03:26:42.04 --> 03:26:44.28
someone at 50 yards, like almost anywhere.

4914
03:26:44.28 --> 03:26:47.64
But you can also shoot someone at 500 yards.

4915
03:26:47.64 --> 03:26:55.84
So it may even be even more that, cause, cause really might be like 12 or 15 times more accurate

4916
03:26:55.84 --> 03:26:58.76
and ease of shooting for a rifle.

4917
03:26:58.76 --> 03:27:00.80
And then the impact, right?

4918
03:27:00.80 --> 03:27:04.44
You know, the impact of a rifle round is devastating.

4919
03:27:04.44 --> 03:27:08.08
You know, it can punch through body armor, certain levels of body armor.

4920
03:27:08.08 --> 03:27:11.20
It can grip through a car, you know, certain parts of a car.

4921
03:27:11.20 --> 03:27:16.16
So you're just going to get better penetration with a battle rifle than you are with a pistol.

4922
03:27:16.16 --> 03:27:23.60
And what's funny is when I got to the SEAL teams, we used to use the, the MP5, which

4923
03:27:23.60 --> 03:27:25.92
is a nine millimeter sub machine gun.

4924
03:27:25.92 --> 03:27:30.80
A sub machine gun is basically a machine gun that shoots pistol rounds.

4925
03:27:30.80 --> 03:27:34.68
So there's small, small little bullets.

4926
03:27:34.68 --> 03:27:42.48
And luckily we went away from that because it's cool for literal close quarters combat.

4927
03:27:42.48 --> 03:27:48.72
So if you're inside of a building, then there is some potential for it.

4928
03:27:48.72 --> 03:27:53.40
Actually, I think that the, that weapon, the, a sub machine gun, like the Heckler and

4929
03:27:53.40 --> 03:28:01.08
Couch MP5, I think he's a great weapon for like home self-defense because it's not going

4930
03:28:01.08 --> 03:28:03.40
to penetrate through a bunch of walls.

4931
03:28:03.40 --> 03:28:06.60
It's really easy to shoot, like really easy to shoot.

4932
03:28:06.60 --> 03:28:12.56
So if someone, you know, let's say you want to get your wife a self-home defense weapon.

4933
03:28:12.56 --> 03:28:18.52
Now look, she could also get a shotgun, you know, maybe a smaller gate shotgun, like not

4934
03:28:18.52 --> 03:28:21.64
a 12-gate shotgun, but like a 20-gate shotgun.

4935
03:28:21.64 --> 03:28:25.98
Pretty easy to handle, kind of a point and shoot scenario.

4936
03:28:25.98 --> 03:28:29.36
So that would be one option, but I think a good option.

4937
03:28:29.36 --> 03:28:33.36
Another good option would be a little sub machine gun that she feels super confident

4938
03:28:33.36 --> 03:28:34.36
shooting.

4939
03:28:34.36 --> 03:28:35.88
Can we shoot machine gun in the California?

4940
03:28:35.88 --> 03:28:37.68
Well, this is semi automatic.

4941
03:28:37.68 --> 03:28:38.68
Semi automatic.

4942
03:28:38.68 --> 03:28:42.56
I don't know what the legality is on the MP5.

4943
03:28:42.56 --> 03:28:45.64
Well, no, you can't have a fully automatic weapon in California.

4944
03:28:45.64 --> 03:28:48.000
No, I don't think so.

4945
03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:54.84
Without certain like criteria, criteria, they have some, the laws, the laws in California

4946
03:28:54.84 --> 03:29:00.76
for weapons are really kind of ridiculous because all they do is they create a law and

4947
03:29:00.76 --> 03:29:05.52
then the gun manufacturers create things that get around the law.

4948
03:29:05.52 --> 03:29:07.88
And it's just weird.

4949
03:29:07.88 --> 03:29:08.88
Yeah.

4950
03:29:08.88 --> 03:29:10.32
It's like this weird dance.

4951
03:29:10.32 --> 03:29:11.96
It's a weird dance, yeah.

4952
03:29:11.96 --> 03:29:15.28
Instead of just being like, hey, look, this is what you, and it doesn't make any sense.

4953
03:29:15.28 --> 03:29:18.56
The whole, I mean, look, you hear this stuff all the time about, what is it?

4954
03:29:18.56 --> 03:29:21.04
Like what's an assault weapon?

4955
03:29:21.04 --> 03:29:23.24
And what was an assault weapon is this type of thing.

4956
03:29:23.24 --> 03:29:25.36
AR-15, assault rifle 15?

4957
03:29:25.36 --> 03:29:26.36
No.

4958
03:29:26.36 --> 03:29:32.52
It's because of like the shape of the grip, like a pistol grip makes it an assault.

4959
03:29:32.52 --> 03:29:38.52
A muzzle suppressor, a flash suppressor makes it an assault weapon according to this weird

4960
03:29:38.52 --> 03:29:39.52
thing.

4961
03:29:39.52 --> 03:29:44.84
So instead of having a pistol grip, they'll like put this weird shape thing that serves

4962
03:29:44.84 --> 03:29:47.64
the same function as a pistol grip.

4963
03:29:47.64 --> 03:29:50.56
But it's actually not a pistol grip at all.

4964
03:29:50.56 --> 03:29:51.56
But it is a pistol grip.

4965
03:29:51.56 --> 03:29:53.000
It gives you the same function.

4966
03:29:53.000 --> 03:29:55.72
They just do all this dumb, silly things.

4967
03:29:55.72 --> 03:29:59.72
And then the gun manufacturers make something that just overcomes that.

4968
03:29:59.72 --> 03:30:01.76
Maybe it's a little bit awkward or whatever.

4969
03:30:01.76 --> 03:30:05.08
Not as cool, but it's just a silly dance.

4970
03:30:05.08 --> 03:30:07.56
It's just like you said, it's a silly dance.

4971
03:30:07.56 --> 03:30:08.56
Yeah.

4972
03:30:08.56 --> 03:30:16.44
And when I was browsing, one of the guys there said something real, one of the main guys

4973
03:30:16.44 --> 03:30:18.36
there, might have been the owner.

4974
03:30:18.36 --> 03:30:21.72
He said something interesting where he was like, yeah, well, one of the main problems

4975
03:30:21.72 --> 03:30:26.76
is the people who make the laws and even propose the laws, they don't know anything about that.

4976
03:30:26.76 --> 03:30:34.04
So they, it's the mere conception of the law comes out of ignorance.

4977
03:30:34.04 --> 03:30:36.12
Yeah, it's just dumb.

4978
03:30:36.12 --> 03:30:37.28
It's just dumb.

4979
03:30:37.28 --> 03:30:43.84
So it's one of the things about California that's just really bizarre.

4980
03:30:43.84 --> 03:30:44.84
It's just bizarre.

4981
03:30:44.84 --> 03:30:48.80
They make laws that literally don't make sense.

4982
03:30:48.80 --> 03:30:49.80
Yeah.

4983
03:30:49.80 --> 03:30:54.44
When they land, it's like, wait, what's the issue here that is solved?

4984
03:30:54.44 --> 03:30:55.44
And they're like, this.

4985
03:30:55.44 --> 03:30:57.40
And we're like, well, that didn't even solve it.

4986
03:30:57.40 --> 03:30:59.72
It actually kind of made some more issues.

4987
03:30:59.72 --> 03:31:02.64
And they made a lot of people mad who are kind of in the know.

4988
03:31:02.64 --> 03:31:08.16
Meanwhile, I can buy a Dead's or Eagle 50 calibers, 50 caliber round.

4989
03:31:08.16 --> 03:31:10.40
I can shoot with one hand if I want to.

4990
03:31:10.40 --> 03:31:13.20
That seems kind of dangerous.

4991
03:31:13.20 --> 03:31:14.20
Could be.

4992
03:31:14.20 --> 03:31:18.84
I mean, depending on what kind of thing you're shooting at.

4993
03:31:18.84 --> 03:31:20.84
How dumb you are.

4994
03:31:20.84 --> 03:31:22.80
I'm pretty dumb.

4995
03:31:22.80 --> 03:31:27.48
But yeah, yeah, that is that's interesting.

4996
03:31:27.48 --> 03:31:28.48
That's good.

4997
03:31:28.48 --> 03:31:30.72
Interesting to know about the pistol versus rifle.

4998
03:31:30.72 --> 03:31:31.72
Yeah.

4999
03:31:31.72 --> 03:31:33.36
Yeah, I didn't realize it was that much of a difference.

5000
03:31:33.36 --> 03:31:34.36
Huge difference.

5001
03:31:34.36 --> 03:31:36.52
It's almost incomparable.

5002
03:31:36.52 --> 03:31:40.04
Probably because I'm thinking of movies, you know, how like, you know, lethal weapon.

5003
03:31:40.04 --> 03:31:41.04
Remember?

5004
03:31:41.04 --> 03:31:42.04
Yeah, well, well apart.

5005
03:31:42.04 --> 03:31:43.04
I don't know.

5006
03:31:43.04 --> 03:31:44.04
He was just really good at aiming.

5007
03:31:44.04 --> 03:31:45.92
So he would be like, at what distance?

5008
03:31:45.92 --> 03:31:46.92
I don't know.

5009
03:31:46.92 --> 03:31:47.92
Oh, yeah.

5010
03:31:47.92 --> 03:31:49.68
He shoots the smiley face into the target.

5011
03:31:49.68 --> 03:31:50.68
Yes.

5012
03:31:50.68 --> 03:31:51.68
Yes.

5013
03:31:51.68 --> 03:31:52.68
Yes.

5014
03:31:52.68 --> 03:31:56.28
That's really depending on what range that would be difficult to do.

5015
03:31:56.28 --> 03:32:00.04
I think in the movie, it was far away, like pretty far shot.

5016
03:32:00.04 --> 03:32:02.60
Yeah, he pushed it all the way back.

5017
03:32:02.60 --> 03:32:04.60
That was kind of the thing.

5018
03:32:04.60 --> 03:32:05.60
Yeah.

5019
03:32:05.60 --> 03:32:06.60
So there you go.

5020
03:32:06.60 --> 03:32:08.80
He said a lot of cool stuff, though.

5021
03:32:08.80 --> 03:32:14.16
And you know, they I like hearing cool stuff like presented a certain way.

5022
03:32:14.16 --> 03:32:16.80
But at the same time, I do like kind of like what it says.

5023
03:32:16.80 --> 03:32:21.000
And when you think about it, you'd be like, oh, man, you know, I kind of dons on you.

5024
03:32:21.000 --> 03:32:22.000
Like certain things.

5025
03:32:22.000 --> 03:32:25.12
And if you keep your head down, you won't see the world around you.

5026
03:32:25.12 --> 03:32:26.40
That's a really good point.

5027
03:32:26.40 --> 03:32:29.92
And even metaphorically, you know, like if you stay in the house all the time or if

5028
03:32:29.92 --> 03:32:32.52
you don't, you know, like they say work life balance.

5029
03:32:32.52 --> 03:32:34.64
I get that that that's a thing or whatever.

5030
03:32:34.64 --> 03:32:38.64
But let's say you don't see your friends or you don't, you don't socialize or, or you

5031
03:32:38.64 --> 03:32:42.92
don't talk to a bunch of people as much because you're focused on this or that or whatever.

5032
03:32:42.92 --> 03:32:47.36
You you'll miss out a lot of beneficial like beneficial stuff for you and your family, your

5033
03:32:47.36 --> 03:32:48.84
whole goals, right?

5034
03:32:48.84 --> 03:32:54.32
You can miss out on key elements of those goals if you keep your head down in all these

5035
03:32:54.32 --> 03:32:55.32
two ways.

5036
03:32:55.32 --> 03:33:00.72
When I was in my first SEAL platoon, we, my, my leading petty officer, he, he had this

5037
03:33:00.72 --> 03:33:03.60
thing like he would want to go out party, right?

5038
03:33:03.60 --> 03:33:05.12
And he would say, always go out.

5039
03:33:05.12 --> 03:33:06.12
Yeah.

5040
03:33:06.12 --> 03:33:08.62
Oh, you know, we're going to always go out.

5041
03:33:08.62 --> 03:33:11.56
And I took that because I was like, hardcore, right?

5042
03:33:11.56 --> 03:33:16.000
And we always go out, like always go out surfing, go out.

5043
03:33:16.000 --> 03:33:17.80
Like there's a training mission.

5044
03:33:17.80 --> 03:33:19.04
Always go out.

5045
03:33:19.04 --> 03:33:20.04
Oh, always go out.

5046
03:33:20.04 --> 03:33:21.04
So yeah, always go out party.

5047
03:33:21.04 --> 03:33:22.04
Cool.

5048
03:33:22.04 --> 03:33:23.04
Get it.

5049
03:33:23.04 --> 03:33:25.64
I'm, I'm, I approve of that when I was younger, you know, now I'm older.

5050
03:33:25.64 --> 03:33:27.60
I'm not so much supported that.

5051
03:33:27.60 --> 03:33:29.24
You know what I mean?

5052
03:33:29.24 --> 03:33:31.44
But always go out, always go on the mission.

5053
03:33:31.44 --> 03:33:35.64
Always step up, always volunteer, always go out, always waves, always go out.

5054
03:33:35.64 --> 03:33:37.44
You know, snow, always go out.

5055
03:33:37.44 --> 03:33:38.44
Yeah.

5056
03:33:38.44 --> 03:33:39.44
Always go out.

5057
03:33:39.44 --> 03:33:45.08
So I kind of adopted that attitude a little bit, not only strictly with going out and

5058
03:33:45.08 --> 03:33:50.60
party, this guy, one time he was super drunk and he's, I think he had to go to the bathroom

5059
03:33:50.60 --> 03:33:56.76
and we pulled back into the barracks and Guam and he like gets out of the car and it's

5060
03:33:56.76 --> 03:34:01.60
dark and he goes running across the, from the parking lot to the barracks.

5061
03:34:01.60 --> 03:34:08.12
There was, you know, maybe a hundred yards of grass and he goes running and I'm just

5062
03:34:08.12 --> 03:34:09.60
kind of walking because I'm not in a rush.

5063
03:34:09.60 --> 03:34:14.20
And I think he had to go to the bathroom and all of a sudden he just like disappears,

5064
03:34:14.20 --> 03:34:18.08
and then I just hear this, ow.

5065
03:34:18.08 --> 03:34:21.68
Yeah, he fell in the hole.

5066
03:34:21.68 --> 03:34:24.68
There's other, he's just like, ow.

5067
03:34:24.68 --> 03:34:25.68
Yeah.

5068
03:34:25.68 --> 03:34:28.76
So there you go.

5069
03:34:28.76 --> 03:34:33.20
With that, we talked about some of the stuff today.

5070
03:34:33.20 --> 03:34:38.72
Hey, Jocko Fuel, get yourself some of these go, new improved flavors.

5071
03:34:38.72 --> 03:34:42.60
I am apologizing for the previous flavors.

5072
03:34:42.60 --> 03:34:47.08
Comparatively speaking, the new flavors are just amazing.

5073
03:34:47.08 --> 03:34:50.52
And look, with the old flavors, it was like, oh, you know, I got my favorite flavor.

5074
03:34:50.52 --> 03:34:51.52
Don't really like that one.

5075
03:34:51.52 --> 03:34:52.52
This one's okay.

5076
03:34:52.52 --> 03:34:53.52
Yeah.

5077
03:34:53.52 --> 03:34:55.80
Actually don't want to drink this one over here.

5078
03:34:55.80 --> 03:34:57.52
You know, it's kind of that thing.

5079
03:34:57.52 --> 03:35:00.72
Now no matter what, you can go party mix.

5080
03:35:00.72 --> 03:35:01.72
Yeah.

5081
03:35:01.72 --> 03:35:02.72
And you're gonna like them all, right?

5082
03:35:02.72 --> 03:35:04.52
You can grab one, grab the other.

5083
03:35:04.52 --> 03:35:06.12
They're all freaking tasty.

5084
03:35:06.12 --> 03:35:15.64
So if you were a little bit maybe cautious or concerned before you tried me like, now

5085
03:35:15.64 --> 03:35:16.96
you can just get right in there.

5086
03:35:16.96 --> 03:35:20.40
Just get right in there and get yourself some go.

5087
03:35:20.40 --> 03:35:22.84
Some Jocko go.

5088
03:35:22.84 --> 03:35:24.56
Fully good for you, by the way.

5089
03:35:24.56 --> 03:35:25.88
Which is a totally different thing.

5090
03:35:25.88 --> 03:35:26.88
I was watching the show.

5091
03:35:26.88 --> 03:35:27.88
A Netflix show.

5092
03:35:27.88 --> 03:35:28.88
I don't know.

5093
03:35:28.88 --> 03:35:29.88
It wasn't my show.

5094
03:35:29.88 --> 03:35:30.88
My wife was watching it.

5095
03:35:30.88 --> 03:35:31.88
My wife was watching the show.

5096
03:35:31.88 --> 03:35:32.88
You're pressing.

5097
03:35:32.88 --> 03:35:36.04
I'm in the vicinity of my aunt.

5098
03:35:36.04 --> 03:35:39.44
They were making this scene of this girl.

5099
03:35:39.44 --> 03:35:40.44
She was trying to travel.

5100
03:35:40.44 --> 03:35:42.76
She was running away from some killers or something.

5101
03:35:42.76 --> 03:35:45.68
So she was driving up to Maine, by the way.

5102
03:35:45.68 --> 03:35:47.52
And she stops at this convenience.

5103
03:35:47.52 --> 03:35:48.52
She's all disheveled.

5104
03:35:48.52 --> 03:35:52.32
She stops at this and she's a disheveled character just to begin with.

5105
03:35:52.32 --> 03:35:54.72
Like doesn't have her shit together kind of thing.

5106
03:35:54.72 --> 03:35:58.000
She stops at this convenience store and just gets like in the scene.

5107
03:35:58.000 --> 03:36:02.52
I see what they were trying to portray there that she's just like doesn't make the greatest

5108
03:36:02.52 --> 03:36:03.84
of decisions in general.

5109
03:36:03.84 --> 03:36:04.84
So like what did she get?

5110
03:36:04.84 --> 03:36:06.20
Like chips.

5111
03:36:06.20 --> 03:36:10.60
And like you know not a good not a sandwich or not a you know she's getting chips and

5112
03:36:10.60 --> 03:36:13.68
then she gets an energy drink.

5113
03:36:13.68 --> 03:36:16.20
And it was like a recognizable brand.

5114
03:36:16.20 --> 03:36:22.72
And I was like hmm interesting how they chose that brand to convey this message about this

5115
03:36:22.72 --> 03:36:24.88
character in this point of the story.

5116
03:36:24.88 --> 03:36:25.88
Interesting.

5117
03:36:25.88 --> 03:36:29.36
And I was thinking oh you know it's a brand you recognize you're like okay cool.

5118
03:36:29.36 --> 03:36:31.80
They oh I recognize the brand on the movie kind of a thing.

5119
03:36:31.80 --> 03:36:35.08
I was like oh that'd be cool if there was some jockel go in there right.

5120
03:36:35.08 --> 03:36:36.08
But it wouldn't fit the air.

5121
03:36:36.08 --> 03:36:37.08
It would not fit the scene.

5122
03:36:37.08 --> 03:36:38.08
Exactly right.

5123
03:36:38.08 --> 03:36:39.08
She had to be squared away.

5124
03:36:39.08 --> 03:36:40.08
Squared away.

5125
03:36:40.08 --> 03:36:41.08
She had to be legit.

5126
03:36:41.08 --> 03:36:42.08
Exactly right.

5127
03:36:42.08 --> 03:36:44.08
I thought that was kind of interesting.

5128
03:36:44.08 --> 03:36:51.20
Bro without opening up a can ADCC you and I just went to the ADCC championship.

5129
03:36:51.20 --> 03:36:52.20
Which was awesome.

5130
03:36:52.20 --> 03:36:53.48
We'll do some kind of a thing about that.

5131
03:36:53.48 --> 03:36:54.48
Little debrief on that.

5132
03:36:54.48 --> 03:36:55.48
That's just.

5133
03:36:55.48 --> 03:36:56.48
In the future time.

5134
03:36:56.48 --> 03:36:58.32
But we had the ready to drink.

5135
03:36:58.32 --> 03:36:59.32
Moke there.

5136
03:36:59.32 --> 03:37:01.28
How many of them did you have?

5137
03:37:01.28 --> 03:37:02.28
I had like one.

5138
03:37:02.28 --> 03:37:04.56
Really I had like because I was there for two.

5139
03:37:04.56 --> 03:37:06.12
How did you only have one?

5140
03:37:06.12 --> 03:37:13.52
Well because I drank one and then it was like the next opportunity I had they were like

5141
03:37:13.52 --> 03:37:17.28
Brian was like because he couldn't give him away or something like that.

5142
03:37:17.28 --> 03:37:19.08
Something happened where they couldn't give away.

5143
03:37:19.08 --> 03:37:20.08
You got scammed.

5144
03:37:20.08 --> 03:37:21.08
Yeah.

5145
03:37:21.08 --> 03:37:22.08
When they were like oh here they are.

5146
03:37:22.08 --> 03:37:23.08
I had like five a day.

5147
03:37:23.08 --> 03:37:25.28
I was there for two days.

5148
03:37:25.28 --> 03:37:28.52
They're freaking so tasty and so good for you.

5149
03:37:28.52 --> 03:37:29.52
Hey and this is cool.

5150
03:37:29.52 --> 03:37:30.68
Good news.

5151
03:37:30.68 --> 03:37:35.56
We have been having a hard time finding the manufacturer for it.

5152
03:37:35.56 --> 03:37:37.12
We just got cleared hot.

5153
03:37:37.12 --> 03:37:41.000
We just built that relationship with this manufacturer.

5154
03:37:41.000 --> 03:37:45.08
We got millions of ready to drink milk common.

5155
03:37:45.08 --> 03:37:46.40
It's delicious.

5156
03:37:46.40 --> 03:37:51.04
Way better than other brands which you and I just had a little taste test comparison and

5157
03:37:51.04 --> 03:37:52.04
it's not even close.

5158
03:37:52.04 --> 03:37:53.04
It's not even close.

5159
03:37:53.04 --> 03:37:54.56
And this is a big brand we tried.

5160
03:37:54.56 --> 03:38:00.64
As a matter of fact my daughter Ranna did a taste test while we were at camp.

5161
03:38:00.64 --> 03:38:01.64
Chocolate milk.

5162
03:38:01.64 --> 03:38:04.32
Like regular milk.

5163
03:38:04.32 --> 03:38:09.52
From a milk carton like ready made chocolate milk but not any kind of just chocolate milk

5164
03:38:09.52 --> 03:38:13.40
that's just made to taste good versus milk.

5165
03:38:13.40 --> 03:38:14.56
Chocolate milk.

5166
03:38:14.56 --> 03:38:15.56
She picked it.

5167
03:38:15.56 --> 03:38:17.76
My daughter Ranna does not play around.

5168
03:38:17.76 --> 03:38:19.44
She's going to tell you what's up.

5169
03:38:19.44 --> 03:38:20.96
She's looking at school.

5170
03:38:20.96 --> 03:38:21.96
Yeah.

5171
03:38:21.96 --> 03:38:23.68
She's kind of like offensive right.

5172
03:38:23.68 --> 03:38:25.84
She's kind of like going to bring it.

5173
03:38:25.84 --> 03:38:26.92
She kind of raised her eyebrows.

5174
03:38:26.92 --> 03:38:28.52
She's like oh damn.

5175
03:38:28.52 --> 03:38:29.72
Yep the milk.

5176
03:38:29.72 --> 03:38:32.000
So we got ready to drink more common worldwide.

5177
03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:34.44
Well not worldwide really.

5178
03:38:34.44 --> 03:38:35.44
Nationwide.

5179
03:38:35.44 --> 03:38:36.96
You'll be able to order it.

5180
03:38:36.96 --> 03:38:37.96
So check that out.

5181
03:38:37.96 --> 03:38:38.96
Jockofuel.com.

5182
03:38:38.96 --> 03:38:39.96
Go to Wawa.

5183
03:38:39.96 --> 03:38:43.68
Go to Wawa and just clean the shelves in there.

5184
03:38:43.68 --> 03:38:45.92
Let them know what's up.

5185
03:38:45.92 --> 03:38:51.000
The more you buy from Wawa the more flavors they're going to bring in.

5186
03:38:51.000 --> 03:38:53.16
The more we'll open up that supply chain.

5187
03:38:53.16 --> 03:38:56.44
So go to Wawa clear shelves.

5188
03:38:56.44 --> 03:38:57.88
Vitamin shop.

5189
03:38:57.88 --> 03:39:00.44
We got pink mist at vitamin shop.

5190
03:39:00.44 --> 03:39:03.84
Right now it's the only place I think you can get it.

5191
03:39:03.84 --> 03:39:06.56
We had to run that first run of them.

5192
03:39:06.56 --> 03:39:07.56
Vitamin shop's been awesome.

5193
03:39:07.56 --> 03:39:08.72
They got everything in there.

5194
03:39:08.72 --> 03:39:11.20
So go in there and just get some get some pink mist.

5195
03:39:11.20 --> 03:39:12.20
It's tasty.

5196
03:39:12.20 --> 03:39:17.000
So we're at ADCC as you mentioned and I'm not going to say who.

5197
03:39:17.000 --> 03:39:18.000
Actually I'm going to say who.

5198
03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:19.000
It's my wife.

5199
03:39:19.000 --> 03:39:21.24
She was like hey this pink one is good.

5200
03:39:21.24 --> 03:39:26.56
This would be perfect with vodka in it.

5201
03:39:26.56 --> 03:39:27.56
She said it.

5202
03:39:27.56 --> 03:39:30.24
You know what you're kind of right because remember back in the day Red Bull vodka or

5203
03:39:30.24 --> 03:39:31.24
whatever right.

5204
03:39:31.24 --> 03:39:35.64
Like that was like kind of that was kind of like a death trap kind of thing.

5205
03:39:35.64 --> 03:39:39.24
You're not doing the right thing with a Red Bull and a vodka and then drinking them all

5206
03:39:39.24 --> 03:39:40.24
night.

5207
03:39:40.24 --> 03:39:41.96
That's bad.

5208
03:39:41.96 --> 03:39:43.28
But think about it.

5209
03:39:43.28 --> 03:39:45.84
The pink mist might balance out some of the repercussions.

5210
03:39:45.84 --> 03:39:50.84
It's not the right thing but it's not it's less it's less wrong.

5211
03:39:50.84 --> 03:39:53.44
They're going with Red Bull and vodka.

5212
03:39:53.44 --> 03:39:54.44
Yeah.

5213
03:39:54.44 --> 03:39:55.44
It's definitely less wrong than that.

5214
03:39:55.44 --> 03:39:58.12
It kind of balances itself out a little bit.

5215
03:39:58.12 --> 03:39:59.12
It's not balanced.

5216
03:39:59.12 --> 03:40:02.56
It feels it feels like a balance but it's a move in the right direction.

5217
03:40:02.56 --> 03:40:06.56
Let's face it we're not going out and drinking vodka and thinking that there's that this

5218
03:40:06.56 --> 03:40:07.56
is going to make it okay.

5219
03:40:07.56 --> 03:40:08.56
Yeah.

5220
03:40:08.56 --> 03:40:09.56
Yeah.

5221
03:40:09.56 --> 03:40:13.84
But if it felt like a violation if vodka is kind of on the schedule which I don't recommend

5222
03:40:13.84 --> 03:40:19.24
right it's not on my schedule at all 0% but if it's on your schedule and you want to

5223
03:40:19.24 --> 03:40:24.16
mitigate the issues that you're going to have then it's not going to mitigate you going

5224
03:40:24.16 --> 03:40:28.16
to jail is not going to mitigate a DUI is not going to mitigate you getting arrested is not

5225
03:40:28.16 --> 03:40:32.12
going to mitigate you spending all your money on stupid shit not going to mitigate any of

5226
03:40:32.12 --> 03:40:33.12
that.

5227
03:40:33.12 --> 03:40:34.12
No, probably not.

5228
03:40:34.12 --> 03:40:35.92
It may give you a little bit of a less hangover in the morning.

5229
03:40:35.92 --> 03:40:38.88
We'll go with that.

5230
03:40:38.88 --> 03:40:39.88
So there you go.

5231
03:40:39.88 --> 03:40:44.52
Joggle Fuel.com get some of that origin USA.com just got back from my hunt.

5232
03:40:44.52 --> 03:40:50.56
It's another one we should just do a podcast about the hunt lessons just but hey we made

5233
03:40:50.56 --> 03:40:55.60
Hunt Gear remember I had said if the Hunt Gear wasn't ready I was hunting in a loincloth

5234
03:40:55.60 --> 03:40:57.72
that was my plan.

5235
03:40:57.72 --> 03:41:03.12
Luckily didn't have to break it into the loincloth scenario.

5236
03:41:03.12 --> 03:41:08.60
Everything is freaking legit and it's just so so good to go.

5237
03:41:08.60 --> 03:41:14.10
Super stoked the team from origin the team in North Carolina the team in Maine everyone

5238
03:41:14.10 --> 03:41:20.24
putting that stuff together is just turned out freaking legit so stoked and everyone's

5239
03:41:20.24 --> 03:41:21.80
kind of stoked man.

5240
03:41:21.80 --> 03:41:30.48
Everybody that I saw that hunted was like hell yeah hell yeah.

5241
03:41:30.48 --> 03:41:32.96
Thank you for making this in the United States of America.

5242
03:41:32.96 --> 03:41:33.96
Yeah that's legit.

5243
03:41:33.96 --> 03:41:35.96
Did you shoot anything?

5244
03:41:35.96 --> 03:41:36.96
Yes I shot an elk.

5245
03:41:36.96 --> 03:41:37.96
Hell yeah.

5246
03:41:37.96 --> 03:41:38.96
I just saw the pictures.

5247
03:41:38.96 --> 03:41:40.96
I just wanted to see what up.

5248
03:41:40.96 --> 03:41:47.16
There's a lot and there's a lot of people this is a very tough year for hunting.

5249
03:41:47.16 --> 03:41:51.20
There's been a lot of rain out west so there's been a lot of grass.

5250
03:41:51.20 --> 03:41:58.16
A lot of grass means there's a lot of eating that means the elk are fat which means apparently

5251
03:41:58.16 --> 03:42:03.08
and talking to hunters they're like well all that fat on the elk means it's harder to

5252
03:42:03.08 --> 03:42:11.72
kill them because they bleed less the blood doesn't flow as easily so it's been a really

5253
03:42:11.72 --> 03:42:12.72
challenging year.

5254
03:42:12.72 --> 03:42:17.76
There's a lot of people that didn't get elk and it's been a tough year.

5255
03:42:17.76 --> 03:42:22.52
I was very lucky very fortunate to get one.

5256
03:42:22.52 --> 03:42:23.52
To score.

5257
03:42:23.52 --> 03:42:29.32
Yeah and I'm at a point now I got four elk with four arrows which is kind of I told

5258
03:42:29.32 --> 03:42:32.72
that to Leif and Leif was like dude you are freaking lucky bastard.

5259
03:42:32.72 --> 03:42:35.92
I'm like I'll take it man 100%.

5260
03:42:35.92 --> 03:42:39.96
So what did you do with the elk?

5261
03:42:39.96 --> 03:42:40.96
What do you mean?

5262
03:42:40.96 --> 03:42:41.96
What did you do with the elk?

5263
03:42:41.96 --> 03:42:42.96
Eating it.

5264
03:42:42.96 --> 03:42:43.96
Oh so you bring it back.

5265
03:42:43.96 --> 03:42:44.96
Yeah yeah yeah of course man.

5266
03:42:44.96 --> 03:42:45.96
Oh yeah you drove huh.

5267
03:42:45.96 --> 03:42:48.24
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay okay yeah I understand.

5268
03:42:48.24 --> 03:42:49.24
Elks for dinner bro.

5269
03:42:49.24 --> 03:42:54.14
Yeah I understand but you know I'm just saying does everyone like if you shoot it is that

5270
03:42:54.14 --> 03:42:55.14
the common thing 100%?

5271
03:42:55.14 --> 03:42:59.28
Oh of course I mean it's you know it's a few hundred pounds worth of meat.

5272
03:42:59.28 --> 03:43:02.82
Yeah but I've heard of like oh they'll give it to the who you know what I'm thinking of

5273
03:43:02.82 --> 03:43:07.000
this actually a few stories I heard in like it was in a different country.

5274
03:43:07.000 --> 03:43:09.12
And then they give it to like the village or something like that.

5275
03:43:09.12 --> 03:43:11.44
Oh yeah if there's villagers that were like starving maybe.

5276
03:43:11.44 --> 03:43:12.44
In Utah.

5277
03:43:12.44 --> 03:43:14.84
In Utah there's no villagers starving in Utah.

5278
03:43:14.84 --> 03:43:16.68
Yeah yeah I didn't think so.

5279
03:43:16.68 --> 03:43:18.28
But so we got the stuff made in America.

5280
03:43:18.28 --> 03:43:23.88
OriginUSA.com if you want to support American company that's bringing like I told Derek.

5281
03:43:23.88 --> 03:43:30.000
Is there anything cooler than buying machines in another country and that were sold to that

5282
03:43:30.000 --> 03:43:32.68
country and bringing them back to America?

5283
03:43:32.68 --> 03:43:35.24
Yeah the concept is pretty cool to beat that one.

5284
03:43:35.24 --> 03:43:39.24
One time okay remember back in the day the little it's this little.

5285
03:43:39.24 --> 03:43:40.24
Wait when?

5286
03:43:40.24 --> 03:43:41.24
Back.

5287
03:43:41.24 --> 03:43:42.24
Back.

5288
03:43:42.24 --> 03:43:43.84
It's called roller racer.

5289
03:43:43.84 --> 03:43:44.84
Do you remember that thing?

5290
03:43:44.84 --> 03:43:45.84
What is it?

5291
03:43:45.84 --> 03:43:50.68
It was like okay so think of a skateboard okay think of a hard bicycle seat but a little

5292
03:43:50.68 --> 03:43:52.96
bit bigger.

5293
03:43:52.96 --> 03:44:00.84
Bicycle handlebars on a half of a super skinny skateboard with a pivot and then the front

5294
03:44:00.84 --> 03:44:02.12
of the skateboard.

5295
03:44:02.12 --> 03:44:06.40
So you sat on it with handlebars down like this and you wiggle it back and forth and

5296
03:44:06.40 --> 03:44:07.40
it would go.

5297
03:44:07.40 --> 03:44:09.96
I kind of remember like seeing people on that thing.

5298
03:44:09.96 --> 03:44:15.88
Yeah it was like a little fat as seen on TV scenario this is back in maybe 90 maybe probably

5299
03:44:15.88 --> 03:44:20.16
before that 80s 80s anyway.

5300
03:44:20.16 --> 03:44:25.60
So one of our friends neighbors had that and they left it out on the road.

5301
03:44:25.60 --> 03:44:30.64
They lived right up the road so technically I didn't steal it but I just wanted to use

5302
03:44:30.64 --> 03:44:32.80
it so I grabbed it and I used it for a few days.

5303
03:44:32.80 --> 03:44:36.64
I was going to bring it back for real I for real I know likely story.

5304
03:44:36.64 --> 03:44:38.04
This is not sounding good.

5305
03:44:38.04 --> 03:44:42.64
It didn't bring it back but the plan was to bring it back at some point.

5306
03:44:42.64 --> 03:44:47.76
So I was using it and then I just left it out in my yard that's how right.

5307
03:44:47.76 --> 03:44:52.48
Few days later it was gone and then we passed by that house every day and I saw it back

5308
03:44:52.48 --> 03:44:53.48
at their house.

5309
03:44:53.48 --> 03:44:59.08
I was like oh they came in kind of took it back or whatever then the guy the kid in

5310
03:44:59.08 --> 03:45:04.64
a good way like oh they grabbed it back no big deal or kind of like totally neutral in

5311
03:45:04.64 --> 03:45:05.64
my opinion.

5312
03:45:05.64 --> 03:45:09.08
I was like oh it's theirs you know like I wasn't going to return it yet I still want to play

5313
03:45:09.08 --> 03:45:13.68
with it for a little bit but hey man it is theirs so whatever and then the kid confronted

5314
03:45:13.68 --> 03:45:14.68
me about it.

5315
03:45:14.68 --> 03:45:18.000
He's like hey you thought you were all slick huh and I was like what do you mean he's like

5316
03:45:18.000 --> 03:45:21.80
yeah because you ripped off the roller racer and I ripped it off back.

5317
03:45:21.80 --> 03:45:26.20
That's what he did with the looms that's what you guys did.

5318
03:45:26.20 --> 03:45:27.20
Same exact thing.

5319
03:45:27.20 --> 03:45:28.20
Man that was a reach.

5320
03:45:28.20 --> 03:45:29.20
I thought it was cool.

5321
03:45:29.20 --> 03:45:30.20
That was a stretch.

5322
03:45:30.20 --> 03:45:35.60
How your brain works for the first time I've kind of started to ponder.

5323
03:45:35.60 --> 03:45:40.76
Like how you got to that story from what I just said and try to connect them.

5324
03:45:40.76 --> 03:45:41.76
It's the exact same thing.

5325
03:45:41.76 --> 03:45:44.76
That's what I'm saying.

5326
03:45:44.76 --> 03:45:47.24
OriginUSA.com get American made stuff we'll leave it at that.

5327
03:45:47.24 --> 03:45:54.000
We won't we'll try not to lure out any stories of madness from you.

5328
03:45:54.000 --> 03:45:56.96
Also speaking of madness jocostore.

5329
03:45:56.96 --> 03:45:58.84
Jocostore is called jocostore.

5330
03:45:58.84 --> 03:46:02.20
So you go to jocostore.com so you can get your discipline equals freedom shirts.

5331
03:46:02.20 --> 03:46:06.08
We got a new one out standard issue.

5332
03:46:06.08 --> 03:46:07.52
It's nothing standard about it.

5333
03:46:07.52 --> 03:46:08.52
It's freaking awesome.

5334
03:46:08.52 --> 03:46:11.56
That's this is the feedback I'm getting from the field but yeah it's a good one.

5335
03:46:11.56 --> 03:46:14.56
Also we have the shirt locker which is the subscription service.

5336
03:46:14.56 --> 03:46:17.68
Seems like you've been getting a little wild on the shirt locker designs.

5337
03:46:17.68 --> 03:46:23.68
Yes and we're going harder even in the next few let's say the next three months are going

5338
03:46:23.68 --> 03:46:25.92
to be kind of like okay I see you I see what you did there.

5339
03:46:25.92 --> 03:46:29.36
We're very excited about the new design.

5340
03:46:29.36 --> 03:46:30.52

We don't know what's going to happen with this platform.

5345
03:46:44.52 --> 03:46:47.36
Did Derek say anything today that could get us banned?

5346
03:46:47.36 --> 03:46:48.36
Maybe.

5347
03:46:48.36 --> 03:46:49.36
He mentioned Donald Trump.

5348
03:46:49.36 --> 03:46:50.36
Oh yeah there you go.

5349
03:46:50.36 --> 03:46:51.36
That could be a flag.

5350
03:46:51.36 --> 03:46:54.64
He said the word Trump so yeah that could be.

5351
03:46:54.64 --> 03:46:58.96
So in the event that we get banned because we don't control the platform that you're

5352

We're talking to you but if you're not you're like wait what happened.

5356
03:47:05.96 --> 03:47:10.64

We got psychological warfare.

Dakota Myers got flipsidecanvas.com.

5365
03:47:34.000 --> 03:47:36.60
I've written a bunch of books.

5366
03:47:36.60 --> 03:47:39.04
Publish some books published by Holly McKay.

5367
03:47:39.04 --> 03:47:41.28
Check that one out.

5368
03:47:41.28 --> 03:47:43.20
And then you know the books that I've written.

5369
03:47:43.20 --> 03:47:49.24
If you don't go to Amazon and put in jockel willing and then you'll see books that I've

5370
03:47:49.24 --> 03:47:50.88
written and you can order some of them.

5371
03:47:50.88 --> 03:47:53.48
You can order kids books.

5372
03:47:53.48 --> 03:47:59.000
Before you even you know you know you got to get the oxygen mask on yourself first.

5373
03:47:59.000 --> 03:48:02.000
If you go to Amazon right now to go you know jockel sounds like he's going I don't know

5374
03:48:02.000 --> 03:48:04.04
what he's talking about here.

5375
03:48:04.04 --> 03:48:05.16
Don't order the adult book.

5376
03:48:05.16 --> 03:48:08.16
Get your kids that wore your kid books first.

5377
03:48:08.16 --> 03:48:10.84
Get the oxygen mask on them then save yourself.

5378
03:48:10.84 --> 03:48:13.000
So the opposite of the airplane.

5379
03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:14.000
No it's the same in the airplane.

5380
03:48:14.000 --> 03:48:15.000
No you're putting yourself first.

5381
03:48:15.000 --> 03:48:18.64
Oh right yes okay opposite of the opposite of the you're right.

5382
03:48:18.64 --> 03:48:20.12
So I could see how you could get confused.

5383
03:48:20.12 --> 03:48:24.64
It seems like hey save the women and children first kind of a scenario but hey you can't

5384
03:48:24.64 --> 03:48:26.64
save nobody if you're suffocating.

5385
03:48:26.64 --> 03:48:27.64
You know what I'm saying.

5386
03:48:27.64 --> 03:48:32.88
But if you're cognizant enough to order something from Amazon order the kids books first because

5387
03:48:32.88 --> 03:48:35.80
you look your life is half over at this point.

5388
03:48:35.80 --> 03:48:37.48
You know you got kids.

5389
03:48:37.48 --> 03:48:38.68
You kind of already blown it.

5390
03:48:38.68 --> 03:48:39.68
One foot in the grave.

5391
03:48:39.68 --> 03:48:41.48
Right you're one foot in the grave.

5392
03:48:41.48 --> 03:48:42.72
But your kids they got their whole life ahead.

5393
03:48:42.72 --> 03:48:43.72
Might as well get them on the path.

5394
03:48:43.72 --> 03:48:44.72
It's true.

5395
03:48:44.72 --> 03:48:45.72
It's true.

5396
03:48:45.72 --> 03:48:47.28
Let them rise up.

5397
03:48:47.28 --> 03:48:53.32
My daughter was she she learned her time tables last year and then this year she's in literally

5398
03:48:53.32 --> 03:48:56.72
the where the word could one mark.

5399
03:48:56.72 --> 03:48:57.72
Same exact scenario.

5400
03:48:57.72 --> 03:49:00.60
So but she learned her time table but she forgot a lot of them.

5401
03:49:00.60 --> 03:49:01.96
So she's doing this other stuff.

5402
03:49:01.96 --> 03:49:05.44
You know you know how you kind of need to know the time tables right.

5403
03:49:05.44 --> 03:49:06.44
Same exact deal.

5404
03:49:06.44 --> 03:49:08.32
She starts crying and all this stuff.

5405
03:49:08.32 --> 03:49:09.84
She doesn't know her time tables.

5406
03:49:09.84 --> 03:49:10.84
She's nine years old.

5407
03:49:10.84 --> 03:49:11.84
She's all this stuff.

5408
03:49:11.84 --> 03:49:16.88
I was like we read that flashcards made a boom right on the spot man on the spot.

5409
03:49:16.88 --> 03:49:21.20
I said you read this whole book twice by the way and you're still crying about this right

5410
03:49:21.20 --> 03:49:22.20
now.

5411
03:49:22.20 --> 03:49:23.96
So you need these flashcards on the spot.

5412
03:49:23.96 --> 03:49:26.68
We do we went slow as a lot of it was review shardy.

5413
03:49:26.68 --> 03:49:29.20
But so I end up the wrinkles.

5414
03:49:29.20 --> 03:49:31.36
Easy money back in the game back in the game.

5415
03:49:31.36 --> 03:49:32.36

03:51:25.36 --> 03:51:29.64
He's at Derek Van Orden.

5460
03:51:29.64 --> 03:51:33.48
You can see the guy's got a big heart and he's trying to help.

5461
03:51:33.48 --> 03:51:35.08
I say we go support him.

5462
03:51:35.08 --> 03:51:38.68
And it's certainly if you're in that district in Wisconsin.

5463
03:51:38.68 --> 03:51:40.28
He brought me cheese bro.

5464
03:51:40.28 --> 03:51:41.44
You see that?

5465
03:51:41.44 --> 03:51:42.44
He brought me cheese.

5466
03:51:42.44 --> 03:51:44.44
He brought me cookies which you ate.

5467
03:51:44.44 --> 03:51:45.44
I sampled.

5468
03:51:45.44 --> 03:51:46.44
Yes.

5469
03:51:46.44 --> 03:51:52.80
You ate the cookies because we're not the discipline doesn't allow cookies over on

5470
03:51:52.80 --> 03:51:55.12
my side of the table.

5471
03:51:55.12 --> 03:51:56.84
Cheese curd which I have not tried before.

5472
03:51:56.84 --> 03:51:58.52
Apparently I got to cook it.

5473
03:51:58.52 --> 03:51:59.52
No.

5474
03:51:59.52 --> 03:52:00.52
No, no, no.

5475
03:52:00.52 --> 03:52:01.52
He said deep frying or something.

5476
03:52:01.52 --> 03:52:02.52
Oh you can.

5477
03:52:02.52 --> 03:52:03.52
Yeah, yeah for sure.

5478
03:52:03.52 --> 03:52:05.36
Cheese curd is like you know what that is technically.

5479
03:52:05.36 --> 03:52:09.96
Well you know my wife is from the Tillmuk Cheese Factory area.

5480
03:52:09.96 --> 03:52:12.64
So we go visit that one every year when we go.

5481
03:52:12.64 --> 03:52:19.56
But it's one of the final processes before they do another one or two processes to make

5482
03:52:19.56 --> 03:52:20.56
actual cheese.

5483
03:52:20.56 --> 03:52:21.56
So it's like the base.

5484
03:52:21.56 --> 03:52:22.56
Does it taste good?

5485
03:52:22.56 --> 03:52:24.36
It depends how you do it.

5486
03:52:24.36 --> 03:52:27.52
That one does because there's like our regular cheese curd.

5487
03:52:27.52 --> 03:52:28.52
Not really.

5488
03:52:28.52 --> 03:52:30.52
I think that's us getting fried in a pan.

5489
03:52:30.52 --> 03:52:31.52
That's what I think.

5490
03:52:31.52 --> 03:52:32.52
Yeah I can see that.

5491
03:52:32.52 --> 03:52:33.52
I have never had fried.

5492
03:52:33.52 --> 03:52:34.52
Cooked somehow.

5493
03:52:34.52 --> 03:52:36.02
That one's solid.

5494
03:52:36.02 --> 03:52:40.20
It just seems I don't know too because he brought it in like a bag.

5495
03:52:40.20 --> 03:52:44.80
I don't think it's supposed to be refrigerated.

5496
03:52:44.80 --> 03:52:45.80
I could see how.

5497
03:52:45.80 --> 03:52:48.40
He pulled it out of the bottom of like a travel bag.

5498
03:52:48.40 --> 03:52:54.28
DVO was not forward thinking on his transport of cheese curd for Jaco.

5499
03:52:54.28 --> 03:52:55.28
I think you might be right.

5500
03:52:55.28 --> 03:52:56.28
For JKO.

5501
03:52:56.28 --> 03:52:57.28
JKO.

5502
03:52:57.28 --> 03:52:58.28
You know what I'm saying?

5503
03:52:58.28 --> 03:52:59.28
Yeah not sure.

5504
03:52:59.28 --> 03:53:00.28
But we appreciate it Derek.

5505
03:53:00.28 --> 03:53:01.28
We appreciate it.

5506
03:53:01.28 --> 03:53:02.28
We will try it out.

5507
03:53:02.28 --> 03:53:03.28
We will see what's up.

5508
03:53:03.28 --> 03:53:07.12
Of course that's Derek Van Warden on all those social media.

5509
03:53:07.12 --> 03:53:11.24
And Echo and I are on there too if you want to follow us on the Twitter, on the gram,

5510
03:53:11.24 --> 03:53:12.24
on the Facebook.

5511
03:53:12.24 --> 03:53:14.92
Echo is at Echo Charles.

5512
03:53:14.92 --> 03:53:16.28
I'm at Jaco Willink.

5513
03:53:16.28 --> 03:53:20.68
Watch out for the algorithm because it'll kind of grab you.

5514
03:53:20.68 --> 03:53:24.44
And thanks once again to Derek for joining us.

5515
03:53:24.44 --> 03:53:27.28
Thanks for sharing some of those lessons learned.

5516
03:53:27.28 --> 03:53:32.36
Thanks for everything you have done for America and what you are trying to do for America

5517
03:53:32.36 --> 03:53:33.36
right now.

5518
03:53:33.36 --> 03:53:38.44
We are here to support and thanks to all of our military personnel that have served and

5519
03:53:38.44 --> 03:53:40.84
are serving.

5520
03:53:40.84 --> 03:53:45.32
Nothing more important than what you do to keep us free.

5521
03:53:45.32 --> 03:53:47.88
And we are grateful for your service.

5522
03:53:47.88 --> 03:53:53.52
And thanks to our police and law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,

5523
03:53:53.52 --> 03:53:56.88
correctional officers, border patrol, secret service, all first responders.

5524
03:53:56.88 --> 03:54:00.60
As Derek pointed out, you're the one that protects.

5525
03:54:00.60 --> 03:54:06.64
You're the ones that protect our kids as they sleep at night and keep us safe.

5526
03:54:06.64 --> 03:54:11.16
And we are grateful for your service as well.

5527
03:54:11.16 --> 03:54:12.16
And everyone else out there.

5528
03:54:12.16 --> 03:54:15.80
And we start off with some George Washington today.

5529
03:54:15.80 --> 03:54:17.88
Close it out with little George Washington as well.

5530
03:54:17.88 --> 03:54:27.36
He said to be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.

5531
03:54:27.36 --> 03:54:29.12
And that goes for life as well.

5532
03:54:29.12 --> 03:54:33.40
And you take a guy like Derek up from nothing.

5533
03:54:33.40 --> 03:54:37.000
And he's prepared for war his whole life.

5534
03:54:37.000 --> 03:54:41.48
And I think he's going to be ready for whatever politics can throw at him.

5535
03:54:41.48 --> 03:54:47.64
And for the rest of us, I think we also have to prepare for war because it's coming.

5536
03:54:47.64 --> 03:54:55.32
And I'm not talking about outright literal war, but in some form, in some form, you will

5537
03:54:55.32 --> 03:55:01.76
be at war for your health, for your business, for your family, for your community.

5538
03:55:01.76 --> 03:55:04.56
War comes in many forms.

5539
03:55:04.56 --> 03:55:06.000
So be prepared for it.

5540
03:55:06.000 --> 03:55:14.68
And of course, the best way to do that is to go out there every day and get after it.

5541
03:55:14.68 --> 03:55:29.20
Until next time, this is Echo and Jaco out.
