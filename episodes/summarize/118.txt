It all, it all gets thrown out the window, because it's, it's only about single file, what has been cleared, what hasn't been cleared, and you could, you could, you could veer from that a little bit depending on what area you're in and can to harm, more mountainous areas, less IEDs, but even then, I've got a story, you know, these guys, some of our guys take a, take a point, take a, on the high ground, then a little hilltop, I mean, just in the middle of nowhere, I mean, middle of, no, I can't emphasize this enough, it is the middle of nowhere, right, and they sit down and this pop goes off, it was a blasting cap that went low order, which means it didn't blow up the main charge, like a 15, 20 pound charge, it would have killed all three of them right then and there, and I mean, I want to say that again, middle of nowhere, there was no reason for there to the IED right there, but there was, this was out in the mountains, and this wasn't even in the, you know, the southern Canterhard district, which is, which is truly just a minefield everywhere, you know, so, you know, the Canterna emphasized how bad the threat is there, and even even taking, even taking a small high ground position behind a rock, you know, this is what the kind of things we ran into, and so that was that deployment, it was a lot of fun, but it was, it was a hard one for us, you know, on month six, that's six months since June 15th, 2012, I was hit by an IED blast by one of these, you know, again, there everywhere, it was, it was the one day we spent in Helman Province, so we went to Helman on an, on an elastment admission to support some marine special operations forces out there, and as, as the early, you know, we always fly in about the middle of the night, we do that so that the enemy can't arm the IED, so the IEDs are everywhere, but they're not always armed, and if they, if they keep them armed, they run out of batteries, and they don't work anymore, so they, so there's, there's a little bit of tactical consideration there, but, you know, and as the early morning hours come and the daylight starts to hit, we start to move around, and we start to clear out this one compound, and hadn't been totally clear jet, and one of my Afghan interpreters was responding to a call, runs in front of me, and completely gets dismembered by about 15 pounds of explosives underneath them, and all I know is I got hit with something, and it feels like you get hit by a truck wall, a bunch of guys in the truck are shooting you with a shotgun, that's sort of what it feels like, and, you know, my immediate reaction was feel my legs, right, so I, I feel my legs and everything's still there, you know, I know something is wrong. Distance from the IED, a couple feet, I mean it's so, I mean, because I would, I would, I'd lia, a few feet, what were you and me are probably, is about, you know, just across the table, and, you know, lots of pain, pain everywhere, but not my eyes, so I was completely blinded, but, you know, totally under the assumption that I just had dirt in my eyes, and, I remained under this assumption that there was really nothing wrong with my eyes for, frankly, for weeks to come, and we'll talk about that, but, you know, I was, I, I didn't lose consciousness, and knew what was happening, I could hear the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, everybody thinks that when somebody gets their legs blown off their screaming like the movies, it's just never the case, it's a very different, like, visceral sound of pain, and it's, and I've heard it many times now, because, you know, this, this happened to us a couple times, and, um, so I heard that, I knew, I knew that rockmon had been hit, because I could hear him, and, um, you know, one of our, one of my teammates tells a story where he, he got hit with a, with a foot, and a building next door, I mean, and it was, and that's how they knew something had gone terribly wrong, and, uh, you know, the medics come to me, there's nothing they can do for me, they, they sort of just wrap up my eyes, they know something's wrong, I really don't, frankly, I just, I keep assuming there's just dirt in my eyes, and that'll be fine, and, uh, eventually, we get taken out of there, and I was able to get up and walk to the heel, because, you know, you know, let somebody carry it when they've got a firefight to finish, and we get on, and, uh, as soon as the medics on the helicopter see me, they, they put me out right away, and I don't wake up for days. Yeah, because that we're doing entire clearance operations through villages, you know, where we're going house to house, or shaken hands, a little bit of shaken hands, it's a little bit of on security, you know, either defending ourselves or going on the offensive, it depends on the situation, but, you know, we round everybody up, we talked to them, you know, we meet with village elders, so it's, it's, it's, it's a little bit of your, your, I guess, your more typical and conventional warfare tactics, so we're trying to meet and greet the population while also, you know, being prepared for battle. I mean, everything's a mess in this eye, and, you know, we'll get him some decent glasses so we can kind of live his life, but he's, he's pretty much permanently disabled, and I just didn't listen, I don't even remember these conversations, like I think I blocked him out, and, you know, it's, because the first surgery was, we've got to remove the cataract, okay, that went well, all right, we removed the cataract great, you know, and the next step is to put a lens in plants, in your eye, like, like anybody normally would, when they have cataract surgery, that's just the normal thing to do. Yeah, I mean, that's obviously when I hear this story, I think Orion Joe who's with me in reminding you, and he got shot in the face, and, you know, it was a similar situation where, you know, clearly his, his eye, one eye was gone, but his other eye appeared to be intact, and he could actually see after he got wounded, then he got put into a, you know, he could see what was happening and, and walked into the Kazovak vehicle, but, you know, they put him into a medically induced coma, and when he woke up, he couldn't see. They just want to ask you a question that you know, that you're going to have an answer to or or maybe they're just new or maybe they know you from extreme ownership and you know, I know you wrote this cool book. And, um, you know, we, we prayed, and we, I, and I look back on it, and, and again, that, you know, we call itself deception, but it was really the strength to stay sane, and, and, and believe that I was actually going to see again, and, and I truly believe that was God's strength is working through me, it was allowing me to, to believe in something impossible, um, because otherwise I would have gone nuts, because people sometimes ask me, what's it like not knowing if you're ever going to see again? And, you know, and that's a guy that was still like, and he also still wanted to come back and get back with his platoon, and was telling me, you know, don't worry, I can smell the enemy, and I'll know where to shoot. And then it was the same type of thing that they were telling you, they were telling him, which is, look, there was some nerve damage, we're not sure, and his attitude was very similar of like, well, it'll be okay, and, you know, it'll come back, but, you know, what didn't take very long before the doctors were like, no, it's, it's not coming back. It was, because they're in their minds, they're like, well, if we do this surgery and his retina doesn't detach, like we think it might, he'll still have, you know, crappy vision, you know, because his corny is all destroyed. And I think this is that super important not to forget or not to like miss interpret where you know, you just, the quote, you just said like you're morning routines and not going to be the solution to your problems kind of thing. No, let's, but we'll, you know, like, I'll drink a whole thing like the, you know, the mugs that we have to travel that they're three ounces. You know, if we care about protecting Americans and protecting the, you know, the, the sanctity of the seal teams and and pushing the right policies from the defense level, then, you know, elected politics is where do I can do it from? Even though the, you know, the Harris County Republican Party has publicly denounced these so-called Slates because they send out these voter guides and, you know, they've denounced them but people don't always know. And you know, you know, there's the, that two mile run you're doing how weak it's like Tuesday or so, if how weak and it's a time, you went through a long time. Like they know what they want the kids to, they know the values that they want the kids to have, but they're not sure how to give them the values. And then, and then it's just, you know, refitting your eye with the right eye wearing, you know, like, glasses and contacts, so I can actually get back to normal life and in frankly, that took years. You know, Tim Tim always says like, oh, you know, he's been out of the Jiu Jitsu for a long time. Right when you heard it, you were like, you know, you want to cut it at this point, not the little, like we just rolled into a conversation. So, yeah, the fact that you were able to recover is awesome, awesome, and, you know, it's, it shows, it should show people that, you know, even though you had a great attitude, the threat of, of never being able to see again was very, very real, very, very, very real. I think I was swollen, um, might have been muscle atrophy from being, you know, medically induced coma for so long, because I've been there, been that way for five or six days, but really couldn't move, um, and just wrapped up really tight, because I mean, as you can see the scarring a little bit, um, I was just, it was kind of been through a meat grinder a little bit, and, um, I was also, I was hallucinating wildly, so, I, everything I saw was Afghanistan. So, in charge of about 50 personnel, mix of seals, intelligence specialists, um, all sorts of, uh, really great people that, you know, as you know, support the teams and intelligence matters. And I know you're like, like, most good human beings, you feel uncomfortable saying, hey, give me some money. No, because hey, you know we're putting 12,000 on this first run and if you sell, if you, you know we'll put some more but if you can sell 20,000 books, that's, that's going to be that's a huge success. Well, not us, but the people that, the people that passed got to not know, but the people that didn't pass, which was half the class, had to go and just run another four mile time run right then to see if they could then pass it. And, you know, because you want people to get to know you and you need to be out there with folks. And, um, eventually got back to Maryland, um, on a, on one of our medical flights, and, you know, my wife was there waiting for me, and, you know, we began how that conversation about, okay, what's the next surgery? You know, we've, we've seen multiple guys get, get blown up and usually our partners, our Afghan partners who are patrolling with us, because, you know, maybe they're, they're just not as careful or maybe the equipment they're using to detect IEDs in the ground, they weren't using it properly, whatever the case may be, or maybe just because it's bad luck and they're just everywhere. yeah, you know, it's I was coming home from Ramadi and I wanted to make sure you guys were ready to ready for the worst possible case scenarios, you know. So that's cool about the immersion camp or some of us nothing is going to be sore because maybe it'll be sore for a little while and then we're just going to cruise a little bit exercise to brain more and then the body is going to go back and do whatever you like. And then you know, he says, you know, because I'm fair, I'm gonna go ahead and let you do this time run again. You know, so to me if you're going to do 20 reps squats, brass, 20 reps, brass, 20 reps until you're like that's kind of boring and have you ever done it before? I mean, you just can't, you know, these people don't speak in terms of like, this is what we think happens in the White House.
