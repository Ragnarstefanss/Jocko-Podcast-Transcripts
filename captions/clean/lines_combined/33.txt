00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 33 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000 Good evening, echo.
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000 Good evening.
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000 People say there is a line.
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000 There's a line between good and evil, right and wrong,
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000 between light and dark.
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000 And that's a nice, clean way to think of things.
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000 But the line can be hard to recognize.
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000 It can get blurry.
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000 It can get twisted by emotion and passion and by one's own ego.
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000 And in war, that line is tested.
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000 It's pressed.
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000 It becomes even more blurry.
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000 It gets crossed and violated,
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000 and sometimes abandoned.
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000 And we can see that throughout history,
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000 and we've talked about it here in the Japanese slave camps in Rwanda,
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000 and me lie.
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000 Those are a few examples, but there are thousands of them.
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000 And I've seen the line.
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000 And I've seen men approach the line.
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000 Driven, filled with fury and with hate.
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000 And that fury needs an outlet.
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000 And if it gets a purchase,
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000 it can become unstoppable.
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000 But it can also be controlled.
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000 Because there is a counter to all that evil.
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000 There is the man that steps up and says, no.
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000 No, not today, not here, not now.
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000 We will not do that.
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000 And the dichotomy of leadership and the dichotomy of war is so hard to balance.
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000 The soldiers are trained and tasked to kill.
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:56.000 And yet they are also trained to be humane and fair and moral and good.
00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000 So how does a warrior reconcile those opposing forces?
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000 How do we know how to be?
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000 How does he know to balance?
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000 God damn!
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000 Thoughts rush through my mind as I try to decide what to do.
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000 Women, old men, and kids, obviously non-combatants.
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000 But this is a free fire zone.
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000 There are not supposed to be civilians in this area.
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000 But dinks occasionally ignore those warnings about free fire areas.
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000 Maybe they are the point element for Viet Kong or NVA traveling behind them.
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000 Maybe they are supposed to give the warning if stopped.
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000 It's happened before.
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000 In that case, some of my men could come under fire and be killed or wounded.
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000 Four or six killed that one tank last evening and he had a Thompson.
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000 There was a whole squad of Kong in that group.
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000 There was some incoming fire when we made the LZ.
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000 A dink tried to cross the dark last night.
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000 These people look innocent enough.
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000 They may be carrying supplies for the Kong and the area, food and or ammo.
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000 It's a free fire zone.
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000 Everyone is supposed to be considered enemy.
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000 I'm responsible for my men.
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000 They'll get killed if I make the wrong decision.
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000 These dinks coming toward us mean nothing to me.
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000 My men mean everything.
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000 What if the dinks aren't innocent?
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000 My men depend on me to keep them alive.
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000 I spoke softly to the men around me.
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000 It's a lick on them.
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000 When I give the order, open fire.
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000 I brought up the M16 to sight in on the dinks.
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000 Spag was standing to my right. His M60 machine gun supported on his hip by a sling around his neck and shoulder.
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000 He reached over and touched my arm.
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000 His whispered voice reflected the agony of doubt in his face.
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000 No, sir, you can't.
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000 Kids, women.
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000 He motioned toward the file of people coming towards us.
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000 I felt ashamed.
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000 Spag was right.
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000 Wait one. I whispered to the men around me.
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000 I'll call for them to surrender.
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000 I felt relieved.
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000 Capturing them was the best solution.
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000 If they were the point for a VC group,
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000 I would just make sure none of us was exposed to fire when we captured this point.
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000 The dinks were almost to the intersection.
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000 I stepped through the brush with some of my men.
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000 Dung, really? Dung, Louis, I warned. They were only 10 to 20 meters from us. They all glanced at us, standing with our weapons trained on them.
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000 We had them dead to rights. They had no cover of no place to run to.
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000 A perfect capture situation.
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000 Almost in mid-strived, they all moved with astonishing speed.
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000 The two boys in the point split up.
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000 The one ran past us heading down the trail past the schoolhouse.
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000 The other boy, the woman, the old men, started running back toward the bridge.
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000 Stop, stop, Dung, Louis. I yelled to no avail.
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000 I could not order the men to run after them. It could be a trap.
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000 Neither could I let them get away. Why would they running?
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000 In the split second, those thoughts ran across my consciousness.
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000 I gave the order to open fire.
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000 An irrevocable wave of death swept in front of us.
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000 After the initial burst of gunfire, I yelled cease fire.
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000 The two women survived long enough to cross the bridge and enter one of the hooches.
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000 Three of my men crossed over the bridge and threw grenades in the hooches.
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000 We heard lead looked over the bodies on the trail, since they were lying in the open.
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000 We had no desire to be caught exposed.
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000 The men reported that some of the dead had been carrying hand grenades in their ammo and ammo packs.
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:04.000 I felt someone relieved. Those supplies could have been for anyone but the Kong.
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000 I received a report from the squad down the trail.
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000 The firing had alerted them, barely fast enough to fire at the teenager running toward them down the trail.
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.000 Someone hit him in the shoulder and knocked him down, surprisingly the boy had jumped up and run past the squad to safety somewhere in the brush.
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000 I had no pleasure in reporting to Delta 6 that we had killed six dinks and one wounded.
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000 I knew he would ask how many weapons we had captured.
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000 I stared at the gray horizon for a long time before answering that the dinks were not carrying weapons, only supplies and grenades.
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000 I felt low. This putrid war.
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000 I thought of so many ways I could have done it differently.
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000 So easy to think afterward.
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000 After all, now I knew there was no dink squad behind on the trail.
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000 This episode would be the darkest of my career.
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:11.000 I called my men together for a march up the slight hill to Delta 6's position, forcing the dinks out of my mind.
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000 That's from a book that we're looking at tonight.
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000 It's called the killing zone.
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000 My life in the Vietnam War by Frederick Downs.
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:31.000 Now Vietnam, it was a hard war, obviously a wretched war for many reasons.
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000 And the Meal Eye Masterker is almost the apex, almost the pinnacle.
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:43.000 It almost seems like the essence of the war in many respects.
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000 At least it's viewed that way.
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000 And it did have a huge strategic impact. It was devastating to the war effort.
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000 And something that should always be remembered is that tactical operations can have strategic impact.
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:09.000 Like Hacworth said, the Meal Eye Masterker probably did more to end the war and hasten our departure from Vietnam than anything our communist enemy did.
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:19.000 And in a similar vein, the war I was in, in the mistreatment of the prisoners in Abu Greb, prison in Iraq and the photographs that showed that mistreatment,
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000 likely did more to fuel the insurgency in that country than anything Al Qaeda did.
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000 Tactical actions can have strategic impact.
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000 And that actually happens in business too.
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:41.000 One bad customer experience for a customer that's got some reach and there can really be a strategic impact.
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:52.000 And what the front line troops do really does matter and what the front line troops do is based on how they are led.
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000 Clearly in Meal Eye there was a total lack of leadership,
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000 especially from the moral and ethical perspective.
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:08.000 But this was not the norm, not by any stretch.
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:17.000 And like I said, it's viewed sometimes as the representation of what the Vietnam war was like, but it's not.
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:26.000 And I said this when we talked about Meal Eye, yeah America has done monstrous things in our history.
00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000 But we most certainly are not monstrous.
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:43.000 We are an amazingly benevolent nation, especially now, perhaps even to our own detriment.
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:50.000 But that's why I wanted to talk about this book, the killing zone, to show the challenges of Vietnam war,
00:10:50.000 --> 00:11:00.000 how American troops handled those challenges and pressures on a day-to-day basis, and how they sometimes cross that line,
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000 if only for a moment.
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:17.000 But then most of the time brought themselves back from the brink of darkness into the light.
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.000 Now let's go back to the book here.
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:34.000 Going to the beginning when Fred Downs, young lieutenant in the army, is flying in the Vietnam.
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:44.000 At 23, 30 hours, the continental Big Bird with a Golden Tail DC8 dropped through the night sky into the landing pattern over the black landscape of Vietnam.
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.000 23 hours earlier, 165 of us had been crammed aboard the commercial jet at the airport near San Francisco.
00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:01.000 I looked around the cabin at the officer and at the officers and enlisted men who had come from all over the United States to catch his flight from San Francisco.
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000 How would they return?
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000 How would I return?
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:15.000 I had graduated six months earlier from the US Army's OCS Program at Fort Benning, Georgia, and now I would soon to be leading men in the combat.
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000 I was 23 years old and I had been trained to lead.
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000 Physically, I thought I was ready.
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000 Mentally, I was as confident of myself as any young officer could be.
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:36.000 But underneath my confidence, were the ever present questions, worry, and curiosity about war and my role in it.
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000 I was eagerly looking forward to finding answers.
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000 I would not have to wait long.
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000 So we've talked about that before.
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000 When you're stepping into a leadership role, you're not going to.
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000 There's a good chance you're not going to feel 100% confident.
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000 And that's okay.
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000 So he gets to Vietnam.
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000 He gets assigned to fourth division.
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000 And he actually hadn't heard of fourth division.
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000 He hadn't seen it in the papers.
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000 He kind of asked, hey, why?
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000 Why have I seen it in the papers?
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000 What are they doing?
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000 And he said, there's no reporters up there where they're working.
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000 It's too rough for him.
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000 And he's kind of saying, you know, I want to get, I want to make sure I get it on.
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000 And some of the old timers are telling him, one of them says,
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000 you'll get a belly full of fighting up there, son, if that's what you want.
00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000 So it's one of those.
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000 Be careful with you wish for scenarios.
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000 And I thought this was pretty pretty interesting.
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000 You know, we talk about hack worth and the hardcore recondos
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000 as the salute and reply.
00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000 The reply is no fucking slack.
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000 So here's what they had here.
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000 It was SOP to salute in the company area, but not in the field.
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000 When in the list of man saluted, he would say golden dragon sir.
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000 The officer would return the salute with right of the line.
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000 I asked about this.
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000 They told me that at that the first the 14th, that's the division he's with.
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000 The first the 14th was an old infantry regiment steeped in tradition.
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000 During the box rebellion in China, the unit had fought bravely.
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000 Afterwards they adopted the symbol of a golden dragon.
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000 The other part of the salute came from some battle in the civil war.
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000 Right before a large battle, a staff officer asked a general where to put the first to the 14th.
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000 The general had roared back, put them to the right of the line where they belong.
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000 The right of the line is where a leader traditionally puts his best men and units.
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000 This comes down through military history, when a man fought with the shield and sword.
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000 The right arm or sword arm was unprotected.
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000 The best fighter was put to the right to protect the sword arm of the man on his left.
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:04.000 Only the most trusted and best fighters held the position to the right.
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000 Legit.
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:15.000 So he's there in the head quarters area for a little while and then he gets his indoctrination and then gets flown out.
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:22.000 He flies out into the field into where he's going to be operating out of.
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000 He gets up there and this is straight out of a movie right here.
00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000 Bugs swarmed around my face.
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000 I swatted and looked at the men who looked right back at me.
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000 It was my first view of American GIs who had spent several days in the jungle.
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:45.000 I stood there in sparkling crisp fatigues, brand new boots, new rifle, clean shaving, fresh haircut.
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000 I even smelled the clean.
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000 My helmet camouflage cover didn't have a mark on it nor did I.
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000 The two men opposite me were filthy.
00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:02.000 They're fatigues were torn and they had scratches all over their skin two or three days of growth on their beard and dark circles under their eyes.
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000 They looked tired and they smelled the high heaven.
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000 So that's right out of a movie.
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000 The boot, Lieutenant coming in to take over.
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000 He's in his pressed cam.
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000 He's looking all square away and these guys look like they're living in hell.
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000 And they introduced the company commander in this guy.
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000 You're going to see throughout the book.
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000 This guy captain sells was an ROTC officer 26 years old son of a father killed in Korea.
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:38.000 So that's, you know, the guy's dad got killed in Korea and he's during the Vietnam war he's joined it up and leading men in the company.
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000 He's a company commander.
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.000 And if you remember from the book, the book, the two leader, you remember he didn't even meet the company commander.
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000 So his direct boss didn't even meet him for weeks.
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000 He'd been in the field for weeks before even met him.
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000 And here's this company commander obviously much more square away.
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000 Walks him around.
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000 The introduces and everybody's giving him a heads up.
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000 You know, this is the way it's supposed to be.
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000 And, you know, he's getting told, look, there's enemy all around.
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000 And you might have heard in that intro piece that I read.
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000 I was talking about Delta 6 and here's a little piece about that.
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000 He informed me that his radio signal was Delta 6.
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000 So that's the Delta company commander's Delta 6.
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000 Lieutenant smart, the first, but two leader was Delta 1 6.
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000 The second, but two leader was Delta 2 6.
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000 This is what the commanders of the unit.
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000 And this is a tradition that holds true in the army and the Marine Corps today.
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000 And it's pretty cool when you're in the field.
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000 You'd hear someone call for the six.
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000 And that means we want to talk to the guys that's in charge out there.
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000 Their seconds of command were known as Fives.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000 For instance, Delta 1 5 was the first Petune Sergeant.
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000 And this is, you know, goes on to talk a little bit more about Captain Cells,
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000 who's asking about his family.
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000 He's getting to know him.
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000 He's got a little bit of a down's hat.
00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000 I had a wife and two little girls back in Illinois.
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:03.000 And so again, you're getting an impression that Cells is a guy that's trying to get to know his people and learn about him, which is the way a leader.
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000 What a leader should be doing.
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000 Now these guys are out.
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000 And he's talking again.
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000 This is something straight out of a straight out of a movie.
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000 Darkness quickly engulfed us.
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000 Watched in astonishment as I pulled out mosquito netting and spread it over my poncho liner and air mattress.
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000 They were a gas that I carried so much extra weight.
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000 No, I answered, this is all the good stuff.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000 Their amazement grew as I revealed three changes of underwear and fatigued clothes.
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.000 Wait until the next day they scoffed when the sun and heavy pack will drag me down.
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000 The jungle would exact a toll for every outside carried.
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000 We'll see, I answered.
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000 Not a good answer.
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000 Lieutenant smart said, yeah, you'll see.
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000 You'll see that the only change to clothes your carias and being an extra pair of socks.
00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000 You'll learn to live in one set of jungle fatigues until they rot off you or rip too badly to wear.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:11.000 That actually reminds me when we were in my first deployment to Iraq, we had three sets of camis and just warm, rotated them.
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000 In Ramadi, the uptempo was so high and the conditions of fighting.
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000 We had to order new camis within a couple weeks of being their guys had destroyed.
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000 Camis could run across the street, they're getting, you know, dragging people and they were just ruining their their camis.
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:37.000 So that was another indicator in Ramadi that we were in a totally different scenario than I was on my first deployment to Iraq.
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000 Back to the book.
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000 My first days on combat control combat patrol introduced me to the visitutes of war.
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.000 Ten foot deep, pungy pits.
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:54.000 Wait a minute vines that collected around the feet and legs until their combined strength stopped you and you had to say, wait a minute while you untangled or cut yourself loose.
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000 The hot sun beating down us on us as we march around with 70 pound packs.
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:06.000 The sweat pouring office, the bugs so thick are faces that around our faces that we sometimes inhaled them.
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000 That and the physical agony of forcing tired muscles to keep going.
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:17.000 It was a search and destroy mission which meant we searched all the hooches we found and then burned them down.
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000 Whether a single farmer's hooch or a whole village all were burnt.
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000 The few Vietnamese we found in the area were women, children, and old men who had been left behind.
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000 When we started to burn their particular hooch, they would start wailing, crying and pulling in our clothes.
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000 We didn't harm the people, but the orders were to destroy all the dwellings so we did.
00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:47.000 The first time I saw a Vietnamese family going to hysterics when their hooch was set on fire, I was unsure of whether burning their home would accomplish our mission.
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.000 The mission was to deny the enemy use of the hooches to destroy any food we found and to teach the people a lesson about supporting the enemy.
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000 But I quickly got used to it and accepted that this was one way to win the war.
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:13.000 And that's, if you talk to anybody, anybody knowledgeable about true counter insurgency, this is not a great plan to go in and basically abuse the populist.
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.000 Now if you know that they're supporting the insurgence, sure you want to disrupt that.
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.000 But oftentimes they're not supporting the insurgence because they want to, they're supporting the insurgence because they're fearful of the lives.
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000 That's the way it was in Iraq when I was there.
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:46.000 So back to the book, Sholden Brand took the opportunity later that day to explain in this unit everyone called the enemy and ultimately all outsiders dinks.
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000 So that's their word that they use.
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.000 And I found this interesting. He says, ultimately all outsiders and you've revert me and you've heard lay from in the book, we talk about moves.
00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:02.000 That's what we call the enemy, we call the enemy moves. But what's interesting is here it says all outsiders and that's exactly what we did.
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:09.000 If when we were getting resistance from, you know, up the chain of command down the chain of command, guess what we call them.
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.000 Moosh, we'd say all the bosses saying this can't believe that moves. So it became the word that we used to, to all outsiders.
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:23.000 And that's that's the unit cohesion and there's some dehumanization of the enemy there obviously.
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:32.000 But the fact that you end up using the same slang word to describe anybody that's against you is is is is interesting.
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:40.000 Back to the book, it turned out that the enemy started calling us dinks first because it was an insulting or demeaning term that meant hairy man from the jungle.
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000 We had just turned the word around and started calling them dinks. At least that was the story.
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000 I don't know if that's true or not. I never never read didn't do any research on that one.
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:59.000 I saw the face of the enemy for the first time. He'd been machine gunned down by one of our gun crews. The powerful weapon in throwing a halo bullets in the brush where we had spotted him.
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:05.000 When we got to his position, I saw for the first time the death of a soldier. The machine gun crew had done a good job.
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:13.000 The young soldiers, green combat uniform body was riddled with bullets. He was sprawled across his bicycle with his face toward the sky.
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:22.000 And last I had before me the enemy had been trained to destroy. He was a young man for whom the war and life had ended.
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000 One evening a jet was returning to base and needed a target to get rid of his unexpected bomb load.
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:36.000 The captain called the forward air controller and gave him the coordinates of a sniper 300 meters away who'd been pestering us off and on for three days.
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.000 As the jet pulled up after dropping the sniper's position, we could hear the pop pop of the sniper firing at the jet.
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000 The men talked about the goal of that sniper as I watched the Napalm burn itself out.
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:57.000 I wondered what would drive a man to stand up to death in so remarkable manner.
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000 Again you're dealing with a hardened enemy. You're getting Napalm dropped on your position.
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.000 And as you burn to death, you're trying to shoot down a jet fighter.
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:15.000 Back to the book, Shaldenbrand was worth his weight and gold to me in running that platoon.
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000 He even introduced me to the platoon motto. It's a lick.
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000 A lick is a lick on a young man's ass lieutenant.
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000 You remember when you were a kid and you did something wrong or something got fucked up that you got the blame for?
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000 The old man would give you a lick in with a switch or a belt?
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000 Yeah, I sure remember getting lickings.
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000 Well when something goes wrong, it's a lick on you. You see anything that goes wrong will give you a lick.
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000 And over here you'll get plenty of licks.
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000 My RTO was the other most important man to the platoon.
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000 His job was carried the radio and stick to me like a shadow.
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000 The radio was our link with literally everything outside our platoon from supplies to survival.
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000 Without a working radio and a good RTO, a platoon leader and the platoon was good as lost in this war.
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.000 My RTO man, a skinny kid, five feet 11 inches tall, was next to perfect for his job.
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000 He loved to know what was going on and his job was akin to the central switchboard operators.
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000 So that's the RTO. That was actually when I was an enlisted seal. That's what I was.
00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000 I always had that same attitude. When you're the RTO, you always know what's going on.
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000 Because the officer's telling you you're right next to him, you're listening to what he's saying to you always know what's going on.
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000 And that was a real good education for me.
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.000 Growing my whole career always being next to the guy that was running the platoon.
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000 Talking a little bit about the troops here.
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:50.000 My squad leaders were first squad, Delcatol Cowboy type from Wyoming, second squad porter, a slightly built black from East St. Louis.
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:58.000 Third squad Jose, a skinny, short, swarthey port, Recon, fourth squad Gallagher, a medium built redhead from New England states.
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000 And of course, there was the platoon medic dock.
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:09.000 The platoon make-up was white, black's port, Recon's Mexicans, Americans and in Indian.
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000 And a Japanese American. All of them from 18 to 21 years old.
00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000 In a combat platoon, we were evaluated by our peers on our ability to help the platoon survive and not on our racial movement.
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000 And not on our racial backgrounds.
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000 A combat platoon pulled together and was tight with each other with no room for the soldier who wouldn't do his share.
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000 So it's always good to just point that out.
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000 These are just people from across section of America.
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000 And these are pretty stereotypical, right?
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000 Cowboy from Wyoming.
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000 This is stereotypical stuff.
00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000 And that's one thing that the military says.
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000 So when I joined, I grew up in New England, right?
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000 When I joined the Navy and I got to California.
00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:57.000 And I went to the enlisted man's club on NAB Coronado, the Gator Gardens back in the day.
00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:04.000 I was 18 years old, and I showed up, you know, because there's a club.
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000 So it's a club on base, right?
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000 And so I go, I'm going to go there.
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000 People say, hey, we're going to go to the club.
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000 So I go, okay, well, let's go see what's going on there.
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000 So I walk over the club.
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:22.000 And as I'm kind of standing outside, I see two guys walk by with with jeans on with cowboy boots,
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000 with big belt buckles and cowboy hats and like a Wrangler shirt.
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000 And I was kind of thinking myself, oh, that's there.
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000 Is there some kind of, is it Halloween?
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000 Is that these guys getting dressed up for something?
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000 And again, this is pre-internet, man.
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000 I mean, and, and, and then I see a couple more guys going to turn out.
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000 It was countrywester night, but at the club that you went.
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:50.000 I had never seen a person in, you know, I come from a small town in Connecticut.
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000 And there's, there's just no cowboys up there.
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000 And in, and interestingly, there's farms and there's people that raise cattle and there's people that grow,
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000 you know, have, have farms, but they don't have cowboy boots.
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000 And they don't want a cowboy hats.
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000 And so it's just, that's what I was thinking about when I read this is just how you take all these
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000 different people from all of this, but they had no idea.
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000 You have no idea what other people are like.
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000 And again, this is pre-internet.
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000 You know, when I joined the Navy, we didn't get to Google.
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:28.000 We didn't watch YouTube videos because you're exposed the entire planet and, and galaxy through YouTube.
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000 Hmm.
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000 First time you saw a real cowboy, huh?
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000 Hmm.
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000 It is.
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000 I thought, I thought they were, I thought they were dressed up.
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000 Yeah.
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000 It is kind of crazy.
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:52.000 And then, you know, I ended up, I mean, in, in, in, in, to you, brooder, we had all kinds of guys from Texas.
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000 And there's all kinds of cowboys down in Texas.
00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000 Uh, but like, I'm in Chris, Chris Kyle was like a legit, whatever, rodeo, dude in life.
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000 Laced a cowboy.
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000 Laced an absolute cowboy.
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000 Yeah, absolutely.
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000 I mean, there's all kinds of cowboys in there.
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000 So, uh, now we, we're going to advance a little bit.
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000 This is the first time that that downs is actually in charge.
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000 Um, he did a little turnover with the, with the former Patoon commander.
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000 He takes charge of Patoon.
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:29.000 And he's doing security for the bridges for some bridges that are out kind of away from the main camp.
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000 And they're out there to prevent landmines and gather intel and kind of set up a checkpoint.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000 And, and they're, they're, they're actually staying out there. So they would, they would set up by these bridges.
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000 And as they're getting set up for the first time, I'm going to the book.
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000 In explosion, rip the air behind me, fall immediately by a scream.
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000 My body instinctively threw myself against the sandbags, is my mind shouted, morder attack.
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000 My eyes register the scene of men frozen and shocked Wonderman.
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000 Their eyes staring behind me.
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000 Man was directly in front of me.
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000 And the track man were off in the background, crouching where they,
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000 where they were when the explosions went off.
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000 So they're actually out there with some tracked vehicles.
00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000 Quickly turning around, my eyes swept an awful catastrophe.
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000 One of the claimors had gone off shattering for over the lives of the three men in front of it.
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000 Jesus Christ, was it a murder?
00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000 No, one of our claimors went off.
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:26.000 Get those men quick.
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000 No, no, no, wait.
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000 There's another claimor out there.
00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000 What the fuck said it off?
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000 What about the other one?
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000 So imagine this.
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000 You get to a position and you want to put out claimor minds.
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:47.000 And if you don't know what a claimor mind is, it's a, it's a directional blasting mind that you set off by command detonations.
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000 So you have a little, a little thing that you squeeze.
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000 And when you squeeze this thing, it sends electrical charge down the wire into the claimor,
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000 detonates a blasting cap, the, the claimor explodes and everything in front of it's going to die.
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000 Well, they had set up the claimors and then they were going to put some barbed wire out.
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.000 And as they were putting the barbed wire out, there was a storm, electrical storm, you know,
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000 a thunderstorm and the static electricity in the air actually set off the claimor.
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000 So it killed or it, it did some serious damage.
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.000 Back to the book.
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000 Only a few seconds had passed since the explosion.
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000 One of my men and I dashed to the other claimor, frantically fumbling on screwing the plug and holding the basting cap,
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000 throwing it away from the claimor.
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000 Then I rushed back to the radio.
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000 Two men were applying first aid.
00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000 The other positions were covered by the men assigned to them.
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000 They had stayed in place during the action.
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000 Good training.
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000 I thought as I fumbled with my map.
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000 It was folded into plastic radio bag.
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000 All of us used to carry maps in.
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000 Delta six.
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000 This is one six over one six.
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000 This is Delta six over.
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000 This is one six.
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000 I need dust off.
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000 There's been an accident resulting in three peanuts over.
00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000 We tried to say nothing over the radio that could be understood by the enemy.
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000 Thus, we used code words for certain things.
00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000 A cool aid was a dead soldier and a peanut was a wounded soldier.
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000 This is Delta six.
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000 What the hell happened over?
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000 This is one six.
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000 Static electricity in the air set off a claimor while three trackmen were putting out barbed wire over.
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000 This is Delta six.
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000 What's your position?
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.000 Over.
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000 Now what would he ask me that for?
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000 I was on the bridge he'd assigned to me.
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000 Let's see.
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000 We're here.
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000 I read right enough.
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000 Real easy.
00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000 Just like all the training.
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000 So he's looking at his map.
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000 Try to figure out where he is.
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000 Of course, that was my first responsibility.
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000 Where a men had been hurt.
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000 So maybe that accounted for what happened next in spite of training.
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000 Lieutenant Lieutenant.
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000 You've got to get a dust off out here quick.
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000 This man's got a bad head wound.
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000 Said one soldier as they brought the wounded over me.
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000 Dirty black clouds with lightning crashing around.
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000 Added the confusion as the wind howled over from all directions.
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000 Huge range drops started to spatter down.
00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000 This is one six.
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000 I'm at coordinates two nine eight zero two eight over.
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000 I read them out.
00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000 This is Delta six.
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000 Are you sure of that over?
00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000 This is one six.
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000 Let's see.
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000 Yeah.
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000 It's that's it.
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000 All right.
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000 There.
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:04.000 One six.
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000 You better check that again.
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000 According to what you gave me.
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000 You're in the South China Sea over.
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000 Oh, did he sound mad?
00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000 God damn.
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000 I've done this a million times.
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.000 The fought ran through my mind as a sweat broke out.
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000 The wounded were groaning.
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000 The storm was reaching gigantic proportions.
00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000 And the track sergeant was demanding.
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000 And nowhere that fuck that dust off was concentrate.
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000 Front concentrate.
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000 I said to myself while staring at the meaningless blob of colors,
00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000 worlds and numbers.
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000 So he's looking at his map.
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000 It's just trying to figure it out.
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000 Suddenly everything jelled in perfect clarity.
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000 Delta six is one six.
00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000 You're right.
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000 My coordinates are two eight eight zero two eight.
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000 I needed dust off fast over.
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000 One six.
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000 This is Delta six.
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000 I know where you are.
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000 I just wanted to see if you could figure it out.
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000 I already called the dust off.
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000 So cap and cells.
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000 This that's who he was talking to.
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000 Captain cells.
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000 That's that's Delta six.
00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.000 The commander of the company.
00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000 And even in this pressure situation.
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000 He's trying to make sure that the guy is thinking.
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000 He's in the opportunity to think for the first time under pressure.
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000 And he already called the dust off.
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:12.000 But he's still putting the test to him and seeing how he operates under that kind of stress and pressure.
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000 Another following situation.
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:23.000 They're kind of sitting in this location and they see a woman start to start to approach where they had some some equipment.
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000 And she was look like she was going to steal some stuff.
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000 And you know, it's kind of no big deal.
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000 Okay.
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000 She's going to steal some whatever some ponchos or something.
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000 Well, then they see her what she picks up as a case of grenades.
00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000 And they're thinking.
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000 Wait a second.
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000 Now this just got really bad because if she was stealing a poncho, okay.
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000 No big deal.
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000 She's stealing grenades. That's stuff that's going to be used to come back and kill them.
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:57.000 But again, because we have a guy with a with a conscience, you know, a guy that sees where the line of darkness is and he doesn't want to cross it.
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000 So instead of just shooting her, which he could have done.
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000 He loads a magazine of trace around, sent to his end to his weapon.
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000 And he starts shooting him around her kind of warning shots.
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000 And then eventually start shooting. He's a good shot.
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000 He starts shooting at the little rope that holds the case that she's holding onto.
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000 He starts shooting at that rope.
00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000 Shoot at it like five or six time.
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000 Finally hits the rope kind of hits her hand.
00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.000 She drops it.
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000 She runs off again.
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:34.000 Just trying to show the discretion that this guy's using as a real contrast to the me lie episode.
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000 Now speaking of that, they've little later on.
00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000 They roll up some prisoners.
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000 One is an old man and one is a young man.
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000 And this old gray-haired sergeant starts going after him.
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000 They got these two prisoners. They're captured.
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000 And here's the sergeant.
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000 So you're the fuckers that zap my buddies in the tank.
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000 The old gray-haired sergeant snarled.
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000 And the old man was running. He swung a heavy fist into the face of the old man knocking him down.
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000 The other fist swung into the face of the younger man knocking him down beside the old man.
00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000 The sergeant was screaming and bellowing as he pummeled the two men on the sand.
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000 They rolled into balls for protection, but were hampered by their tied hands.
00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000 I ran from the road yelling my two men to pull the sergeant off the prisoners.
00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000 They grabbed him by his soldiers as he fought them to get back to the Vietnamese.
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000 He lashed out with his foot at the prisoners, catching one of them in the side.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000 And the hell are you doing, sergeant? Those men are my prisoners I exclaimed.
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000 His face was red with fury as he yelled back at me.
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000 You had no right to take those stinking, cong prisoners.
00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000 He smelled of beer that he had drunk.
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000 You should have killed those motherfuckers like they killed that other tank crew.
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000 Fuck! These men are tied up. We don't know who they are. I yelled back.
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000 I was saved by the sound of Lieutenant Knut, Knutson's voice breaking over the argument.
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000 Calm down, sergeant. Go back to your tent.
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000 The Lieutenant was the commander of the tanks. Again,
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000 I'm pointing this out. He's new in country. He sees somebody beat Napa Prisoner.
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000 They had just lost one of the tanks to a mine earlier.
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000 And obviously the gray-haired sergeant's pissed.
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000 And he wants to take it out on these guys.
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:22.000 But, you know, comers, cooler heads prevailed in that situation.
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000 Now speaking of mines, mines back to the book mines continue to be laid in the road at irregular intervals.
00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.000 It was a fact of life, but the terror of an explosion never failed to send a shiver through our guts no matter how many times we heard them.
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000 Whatever we were doing our heads would jerk around.
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000 It was a terrifying to hear the explosion.
00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000 CD ugly gray and black crowd clout as it ripped into the air.
00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:51.000 CDark pieces of metal can't this machinery and human beings flying in the blossom of death out from the center of destruction.
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000 And this one big mine happens.
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000 And he's going to check it out. It's a truck. It's a vehicle.
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000 I approached the twisted wreck. It was very disheartening to see the smoking wreck,
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000 which had once been the carrier of human beings.
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000 There were less smoke drifting upward from the Hulk.
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:17.000 As we approached closer, we saw parts of the driver's body mangled beyond recognition in the cabin on the ground.
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:25.000 The main portion of the driver was only recognizable because we knew that was what it was supposed to be.
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:32.000 My man ran toward the still living being huddled in the rice paddy, muleing over and over that his leg was gone.
00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000 The scene of desolation brought about the true impact of the Vietnam War to me.
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:45.000 There was no enemy to fire at. There was no nothing to retaliate against.
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:52.000 At a distance, the traffic of vehicles and Vietnamese watched.
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000 All that remained was the messy job of cleaning up while thinking that this could happen to us.
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000 A small part of our mind tried to retain its sanity by reminding itself over and over.
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.000 That it would never happen to us. It could happen to everyone else, but it would not happen to me.
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:24.000 With that in mind, we started scraping up what was left, preparing it for the plastic body bag.
00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:34.000 Eventually, they go from guarding the bridges to where they start doing patrols out in the jungle.
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000 An ambush is out in the jungle and direct action missions out in the jungle.
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000 At this point, they're out in the jungle.
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000 I'll go to the book. My platoon and I had not shaved for three or four days.
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.000 Delta 6 was a bear about shaving.
00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000 Combat patrol or not.
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000 Just because we lived like animals didn't mean we had to look like them.
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000 It was his way of thinking.
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:05.000 Throwing my fatigue jacket across a bush, I grabbed my shaving gear and told Spag and Viseanor to accompany me.
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000 We would guard each other as we shaved.
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000 The company commanders coming out and they're on a shaving.
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000 They're like, okay, we got a shave real quick.
00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000 But again, you can see that Captain Selz has a real influence.
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000 And you can see that discipline.
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000 It's carries over.
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000 And when you let it slack and then you go visit your troops and they have to get back in line.
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000 It brings them back to humanity.
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000 It makes them remind them of things.
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000 Because think about it.
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000 That shaving is something you do in the military every single day.
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000 So when all of a sudden you're out in the field, you start losing that.
00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000 You start slipping away from that.
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000 And things start other things start slipping away as well.
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000 They get into a, they get into some fire fights out there.
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000 And at one point he gets wounded and I'm going to the book.
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000 After homes had finished bandaging my arm.
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.000 I put on my fatigue jacket and let a cigarette.
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000 I felt good.
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000 I had only been in country a few months and I had my second purple heart.
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000 The first one had been from a wound received in October.
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000 To top it off, I had been wounded twice in one day.
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000 Shot in the ear in the morning and hit with a grenade trapping on the afternoon.
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000 Luck was with me.
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000 All three wounds had been slight.
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000 Now you can say luck when you get shot in the ear.
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000 And you are lucky for sure.
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:35.000 But that's a real, that's a real eye opener indicating that you realize how close you were to die.
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000 And I had guys get shot in the helmet and they didn't like it one bit.
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000 Because that's real close.
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000 Someone got real close to getting you.
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:56.000 Now going forward more, there's a battle going on and the companies out in the field.
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.000 And they're not directly involved in the battle.
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000 So they get told, okay, you want you to go set up where the VC is going to run to.
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000 Where we think they're going to run.
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000 You guys set up a blocking force so that way when the VC runs into you, you ambush them and take them out.
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000 So they're kind of maneuvering to go set that up.
00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000 His普通 is maneuvering to set that up and we're going to book after 15 minutes or so.
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000 We were approximately halfway down the ridge.
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000 The captain gave me a call.
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:29.000 Dragon six had decided it would be better if I have to my普通 marching the two elements in opposite directions in order to cover a larger area.
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000 I was dead set against this.
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:42.000 My普通 was below strength and dividing it would be asking two reinforced rifle squads to defend hundreds of acres of jungle against a foe of unknown size.
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000 So dragon six is above the company commander.
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000 This is now the battalion commander.
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000 And so now you're getting an order from the battalion commander.
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000 So it's, you know, you're a young lieutenant,
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000 a platoon commander and you're getting told to do this and he doesn't feel good about it.
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000 Back to the book.
00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:02.000 But orders were orders, especially from dragon six.
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000 I passed back the word for Shalden brand to come up.
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000 I was pouring over my map and compass when Shalden brand reached me.
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000 The battle was full, full blown.
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000 It sound, it sound provided background noise.
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000 It's a brief shelly on the situation and our orders.
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000 Shit, I don't like it sir.
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000 I know I don't either, but it's a lick.
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000 You got your map and compass.
00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000 Good.
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000 So it's all kinds of reasons why they don't like this idea.
00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.000 Obviously one that he already stated was that, you know, you take your platoon and you cut him in half.
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000 That's, that's just, you don't have the same fighting capability at all.
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.000 I think they had one one heavy machine gun in each squad.
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000 So now you got basically their down to two squads because they were under strength.
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000 So we're talking one heavy machine gun.
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000 And by the way, if somebody gets wounded, you know, you got your wounded guy.
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000 And if you're going to carry that guy, it takes two or three guys to carry the guy.
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000 So that's four guys gone.
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000 So you could very easily be outnumbered outman and outgun by the enemy.
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000 So he doesn't like this idea on top of that.
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000 I will tell you, he doesn't talk about it here.
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000 When you split up in a situation like this, it becomes very difficult to do command and control.
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000 And now you got two elements that are weaker size and you're no longer able to support each other.
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000 That's the premise of cover move.
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000 Cover move means you want to be close enough that you could support each other.
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000 You don't want to split far apart where you can't help each other or something happens.
00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000 Well, that's what they're getting told to do.
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000 They don't like it.
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000 And, but they do it.
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000 And maybe he should have protested more, but he's getting orders from the battalion commander.
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000 And he says, okay, let's do it.
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000 And of course, within a couple minutes of doing it, they lose radio contact.
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000 So now they can't, they can't hear each other and they're starting to march apart.
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000 Finally, they get radio, they get connected on the radio again.
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000 They get comms again.
00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000 And it sounds like this.
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000 One five.
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000 This is one six.
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000 Have you figured out where you are yet?
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000 This is one five.
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000 Negative.
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000 So Shelley with his squad is lost.
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000 Doesn't know where he is.
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.000 Okay.
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000 Now, the lieutenant's all set up, though.
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.000 They're in their position where they're thinking the enemy might come by.
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000 They're set up to attack them.
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000 And here we go back to the book.
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000 Lieutenant, Porter whispered as he reached my side.
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000 We hear noises to our front.
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000 Commander moving across in front of us in the jungle, hold on a second, Porter.
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000 One five.
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000 This is one six.
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.000 The sound of the battle should be on your right.
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000 If you're going in the right direction, where are the sounds over?
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000 This is one five.
00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000 Negative on the right.
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000 The sounds are on the left over.
00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000 One five.
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000 Did you just say the sounds are on your left?
00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000 I was squeezing the handsets so hard my knuckles were white.
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000 Affirmative.
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.000 Jesus Christ.
00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000 One five.
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000 I hosted whispered intensely.
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000 Into the mouthpiece, you're heading in our direction.
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000 I could hear the sounds of men moving through the jungle below us.
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000 I whispered the Porter.
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000 Get back down there and tell them to hold their fire.
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000 That may not be thanks after all.
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000 Hurry.
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000 Porter had heard the conversation with Shelley and quickly turned to our to carry out at my order.
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000 He couldn't yell because the sounds were coming from the dink soldiers.
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000 His yell would put us in jeopardy.
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000 As Porter started toward the crew, the machine gun crew opened fire.
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:32.000 The harshness of the guns multiple explosions ripped across my thoughts as it sound echoed through the handset I was holding next to my ear.
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000 The sound of American swearing and screaming rebounded from the jungle below and from my handset.
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000 Sees fire.
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000 Sees fire.
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:40.000 I screamed.
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000 Sees fire.
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000 So he can actually hear his guys getting shot by his own guys.
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000 We have a blue one blue.
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000 Porter and I were running to the gun crew both of us yelling.
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000 Sees fire.
00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000 Sees fire.
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000 The sound of their gun blanketing the screams in front of them.
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000 A abruptly the gun quit firing.
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000 I yelled into the jungle.
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000 Shelley, is that you?
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000 Yes, yes.
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000 Stop firing.
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000 Don't fire.
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000 I was answered by many voices.
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000 I stood there and instant.
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:16.000 The horrible realization that I had fired on my own men's swept over me like a wave from an ice cold hell.
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000 The gun crew looked at me.
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000 Their faces filled with shock.
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:26.000 I ran leaping and falling down to the brush line where my men were asking the question to anybody hit for Christ's sake.
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000 Gallagher yelled back as I burst into a small clearing.
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000 One man, the point man.
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000 So there you go.
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000 Blue on blue.
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000 Another reason why if you don't have to separate your forces you don't.
00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000 You don't separate your forces unless you have to.
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000 And when you do it you do with extreme caution.
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:55.000 And when we've we've we've we've we've we've we've we've we've we've we've we've talked about blue on blue it happens and always books it happens in my book and some of these descriptions right here.
00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:02.000 I recognize those 100% when he says the horrible realization that fired on my own men swept over me like a wave from an ice cold hell.
00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:15.000 Yeah, I totally recognize that and the fact that he says the gun crew looked at me their faces filled with shock when I when I explained to my guys in the field like that was a blue on blue their faces were just complete shock.
00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:25.000 If you're in the military if you're in law enforcement be very careful when you split your forces.
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:33.000 It's if it just multiplies the challenges sometimes it is necessary but you got to keep control over it.
00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:40.000 And now we go to where he's calling for a met a back for his for his wounded guy.
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000 Delta six is one six over this is Delta six over this is one six.
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:52.000 I need to dust off for a peanut we've run into a little action over this is Delta six what do you mean a little action what's going on what happened over.
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000 My knees felt weak in my stomach with sour.
00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000 This is one six we had a little difficulty with with with the terrain and.
00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:11.000 I ambushed one five over what how the fuck did you do that one six you mean you ambushed your own men what kind of after you running up there.
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:17.000 That's the most ass-night thing I've ever heard of you get your head out of your ass one six and get that between straightened up you got that over.
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000 This is one six affirmative over.
00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:31.000 Ah one six give me your coordinates the dust off saw this way how bad is your peanuts over this is one six not too bad he'll lose a couple of toes but everybody else is okay over.
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000 All right one six settled down out.
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:45.000 He was more gentle with the last transmission because I'm sure he heard my voice showed the strain I was feeling whatever the reason I welcome the sound of his voice.
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000 Perhaps he understood better than I thought what had happened.
00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000 So he comes out and real hard.
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:59.000 He realizes that the guy feels horrible and and and then he kind of backs off and says set along he also knows he's got to stay in the game.
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:11.000 And there's a nightmare of a video on YouTube of and there's actually it's from a documentary but there was a really bad blue on blue in the first Gulf War where a patchy gun ship let it lit up.
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:19.000 I think it was a Bradley some kind of APC it's a nightmare but you can hear the one guy that fired.
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:27.000 They're saying hey you got to get back in position you know hold the line basically and he's like I just killed my own guys I want to come back in there they're saying negative.
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:35.000 And so that's basically what this what Captain Cells is doing here saying hey listen okay I'm pissed but guess what calm down.
00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:43.000 Settle down get you shit together and he says out and and by the way for those folks that aren't military.
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:49.000 Over when you say over at the end of a transmission on the radio it means you expect a reply.
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:56.000 When you say out there's no reply expected so like when we end this podcast I say out because it's over there do you don't don't don't.
00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:05.000 Don't don't don't say anything back to me it's over I don't say over and sometimes you'll hear people say over and out in the military that doesn't you don't say that it doesn't make any sense.
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000 So when you hear that in a movie know that they know that they are cheesy.
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:16.000 Is that kind of like when you when they hang up the phone on the movie you go to and hear the dialto.
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000 Yes that doesn't really happen either.
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:26.000 I trudged back back to the book I trudged back to my position one five in his men following man handed me a.
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:32.000 A can of coffee I changed smoke my cigarettes and drank coffee while the patron expanded into a larger perimeter.
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:39.000 I stood facing the mountain the battle still raging on one five walked over to me still shaken from his experience.
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:47.000 He told me how he was sorry that he had gotten me in such a Dutch with a captain and we discussed the operation going over his mistake while he attempted to figure out ways.
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000 To keep it from happening again if we were ever split up.
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000 Shelley and I had been through too much together for me to blame him for what had happened.
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000 I told him so and we let it go at that we had been lucky.
00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.000 Besides I blamed myself for what had happened.
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.000 The responsibility for any unit actions ultimately rests with its commander.
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:14.000 The leader got the glory when things worked out and he took the blame when they didn't.
00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:25.000 That went with the job when it came right down to it the men were my responsibility and I had failed them today.
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:32.000 A little bit of extreme ownership if you read the book extreme ownership that lay for and I wrote the opening chapter that's what it's about.
00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:43.000 Blue on blue and doing exactly what what lieutenant down did right there taking ownership of what the mistakes were made in the battlefield.
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:54.000 Back to the book there's a couple of got well actually not yet there they link up with another with another platoon and now there have an conversation.
00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:01.000 Downs is having a conversation with another officer named Anderson a drink was lying next to us as we talked.
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000 He had a black ace of spades stuck onto his fist.
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:16.000 Anderson what's that all about that's so the dinks know what outfit fucked them up over here look around most of the dinks got those in their hands sure enough the dinks were all holding an ace of spades.
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:25.000 That's a good idea but where did you get all the aces one of the guys moms works in a card store so he wrote home asking to send her a couple packs of nothing but aces spades.
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000 Why did we want to kill dinks.
00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:37.000 After all we had mostly been law-biting citizens back in the world and we were taught that to take another man's life was wrong.
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000 Somehow the perspective got twisted in a war.
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:47.000 The government told us it was all right and in fact a must to kill members of another government's per people.
00:53:47.000 --> 00:54:00.000 Then we had the law on our side it turned out that most of us like to kill other men some of the guys which shoot it a dink as much as they would add a target.
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:06.000 Some of the men didn't like to kill a dink up close the closer the killing the more personal it became.
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:15.000 Others in the platoon like to kill in close a few even like to torture the dinks if they had a prisoner or cut the dead bodies with knives and a frenzy of aggression.
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:21.000 A few didn't like to kill at all and wouldn't fire their weapons except to protect their buddies.
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000 Mostly we all saw it as a job and rationalized it in our own way.
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:34.000 Over at all ran the streak of anger or fear that for brief moments ruled us all.
00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:42.000 My job as platoon leader was to control the spectrum of emotions to guide the men towards survival.
00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:49.000 I didn't believe in torturing or allowing a dink to die a lingering death in the jungle we never took prisoners if we could help it.
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000 Every day we spent the jungle he wrote into a little more of our humanity away.
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000 Prisoners could escape to become our enemy again hence no prisoners.
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:10.000 The philosophical arguments in favor of man's ability to resist the slide into barbarism sound noble and rational in a classroom or at a cocktail party.
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:18.000 But when the enemy is bearing down on you bent on taking your life away from you it's not his country against your country.
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000 Not his army against your army, not his philosophy against your philosophy.
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:30.000 It's the fact that that son of a bitch is trying to kill you and you better kill him first.
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000 That's a reality right there.
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:40.000 Now going back to tactics a little bit.
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.000 Back to the book there was a spot about midway down the mountain marked in blue that meant something bigger than a stream.
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:56.000 If I were an enemy commander that would be a perfect spot for a camp high mountains on three sides a good water supply thick jungle growth and escape path in any directions.
00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:02.000 If he decided on that location the enemy commander would be counting on attack from the valley up towards his location.
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:07.000 He would have his back guarded but not very heavily or so I reasoned.
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:10.000 I just liked that because you can see he's getting his mind in the mind of the enemy.
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.000 He's thinking about what was he looking at the map. He sees stream. He sees valley. He sees good good covered positions from three sides.
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:23.000 He's thinking okay this is what the enemy must be thinking right here.
00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:37.000 Now the fighting continues and as always you know I'm burning through book. I mean this is a this is a 250 page book and I'm reading you know what maybe 20 pages from it.
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:43.000 So there's so much action going on and so many good lessons to learn.
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.000 Obviously I can't cover them all that's why you can buy this book yourself as you should.
00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:57.000 But here we go I'm going to a point here where they've been in a firefight. They got three wounded one of the guys lost an arm one of them's unconscious.
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:05.000 And they're getting they have a helicopter to come in and the helicopters lower down a cable and they're lifting the guys out to get them to a meta-vax situation.
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:15.000 Back to the book the signal was given and the cable pulled him off the ground about halfway up he waved all of us grinning like a treasure cat blood dripped on us.
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:29.000 Who's a picture I shall always hold in my mind a man dangling from a cable holding a stick fast into a turnic it on the stump of his leg waving at his comrades with the other hand a cigarette dangling from his lips.
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:36.000 One six this is getting hairy up here we're starting to take fire the pilot reported hold on just one more.
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:44.000 Spagon I lifted the unconscious man up while we slid the vest onto him someone had to be the cable which I hooked onto the ring.
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000 The unconscious man was wimched upward dangling like a limp doll at the end of a cable.
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:58.000 Spagon I stood underneath watching this final Exodus as the crew man reached out to grab the man something went wrong.
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:04.000 The man had become unhooked and somehow fell through 50 feet of sky towards us.
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000 We jumped back as the man fell in a heap at our feet.
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000 The medic and I pulled the man over.
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000 Fuck he stopped breathing.
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:21.000 He goes on to say the nutrition rate on our side was terrible on our morale.
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:26.000 Although we killed and wounded many of the NVA we never knew how much it hurt them.
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000 It seemed there was an unlimited number to take their places.
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:38.000 But on our side when we lost a man we all knew and it wore heavily on our minds.
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:48.000 The constant marching and fighting demanded two things of us strength and absolute reliability.
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:57.000 Now they're moving out on another operation and there's one of the soldiers named Yoder.
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:04.000 Yoder was the point man. He was experienced and full of good humor due to his promotion to door gunner.
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:08.000 A good man to have on point any day he was aggressive and unaffraid.
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000 Even though he was going in soon there was no question of putting someone else in his place on point.
00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000 It was his turn and he would not have it in any other way.
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000 So he's getting promoted to door gunner so he's going to pull out the field.
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000 He's going to fly around and helicopter.
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:25.000 You know, relatively safe compared to being in the field.
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:31.000 He reminded me of a hillbilly with this course language, man, rhythms and humor.
00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.000 I was always asking him who he was going to get that front tooth replaced.
00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:39.000 That missing tooth made him look more like a hillbilly than anything else.
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:44.000 He always laughed and said, fuck sir, I ain't about to let them fucking army dentist work on me.
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000 She had no that would be a lick on me.
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:55.000 So they continue their patrol and they're coming up on this kind of flat area and Yoder,
00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000 Crap forward and a crouch looked back at me and grinned.
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000 I grinned back and nodded my head.
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:07.000 Yoder stepped over a tree route holding up part of the small gully bank.
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:13.000 At that moment all hell broke loose as a chai-com machine gun strafed the point element.
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000 Yoder was hitting the body and fell forward into the gully.
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:20.000 The machine gun acted as a key which triggered a complete ambush.
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.000 We walked into a classical U-shaped ambush with the machine gun being at the base of the U.
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:33.000 So we used to call this a fire sack when you get ambushed and you're completely surrounded by the enemy.
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000 That's where they are.
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000 Starts with this machine gun, hit Noder and then just breaks out.
01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:48.000 Explosions, machine guns and rifle bullets rip through the air and ricochet off the ground and trees around us.
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.000 The noise was overwhelming men were screaming and yelling trying desperately to get cover or screaming when they were hit or thought they were hit,
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000 which was almost as terrifying.
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.000 We still not seen any of the enemy in the thick growth around us.
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000 Most of us in the point played dead.
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:10.000 I lay trying to get my thinking organized as to what to do so you're just taking massive ambush and you're laying there thinking,
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000 what am I going to do?
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000 I could hear Yoder crying on the other side of the route where you'd fallen.
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000 He cried out for me to come and get him.
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000 Lieutenant, I've been hit, I've been hit bad, I'm dying, please come and get me, please come and get me.
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000 I turned my head in his direction.
01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:36.000 Twigs and bark from trees were falling like snow all around us as the terrible shrapnel and firepower rip through the jungle around us.
01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.000 I was terrified.
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:53.000 So they're pinned down and he's actually ends up going to try and help one of the other guys first, a guy named Bell.
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000 Then he gets to Bell under covering fire.
01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000 And he says Bell was able to help me but couldn't see anything.
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:07.000 He limped and crawled, I pushed and swore as we continuously fell in our flight back up the hill.
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000 As I pulled him up the hill, one of my feet was shot up from underneath me.
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000 I'd been shot in the hill, one of the bullets knocking off a piece of my boot heel.
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000 And then the force had knocked me down.
01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000 I got to begin and felt a tremendous blow to my hip, knocking me down.
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:24.000 He'd again, I thought, finally I got Bell behind a rock.
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000 Doc was there and started working on him.
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.000 I lay on my back looking up at the sky through the jungle canopy, not believing I'd actually made it down there and back.
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.000 Yoder was still down there and although I had witnessed the bullets hitting him, I didn't want to leave.
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000 I had to be absolutely sure he was dead.
01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000 I would never forgive myself if I pulled back and he was still alive.
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:49.000 I was ready to call artillery in on our position if we were overrun.
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000 That's like the ultimate.
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000 The ultimate game over move.
01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000 We're going to be overrun by the enemy.
01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000 Here we go.
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000 I'm going to call all the ordinance on my position.
01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000 Drop.
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.000 Luckily, the fire subsides, one of the other pertains had come to their help.
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000 And now that other pertune shows up and the enemy's pretty much gone and it stops shooting.
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000 We all stood up.
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000 A couple of my men and I ran down to where three sixes point was standing over Yoder.
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:23.000 I leaped over the edge of the gully and stopped at Yoder's body.
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000 Neeling down, I turned his body over.
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000 He had died with his head lying downhill.
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000 His face was a dark blue from the blood which gravity had pulled into the downhill portion of his body.
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:40.000 There wasn't much blood on his body but numerous bullet holes were cut into his fatigues covering his stomach and chest.
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000 His eyes were closed.
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000 I looked at him for a moment.
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000 My thoughts running back to our many conversations in the past.
01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:53.000 Once we had discussed whether we would go to the aid of one of our fellow soldiers if he was in trouble.
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000 I had told him I would always respond to one of my men if they needed help.
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000 He had replied it would be a lick on me.
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000 I wondered if he had known that I tried to get to him.
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000 He was the first man under my command to die.
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.000 I looked up to see some of my platoon and three-sixes platoon standing over a dink body in the gully.
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:21.000 Three-sixes had an Indian hiss platoon and I had an Indian in my platoon.
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000 They drew their knives and slashed the enemy's body in frustration.
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000 This was the only dead dink the men could find.
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000 One lousy dink for all that pain and suffering.
01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000 At least we could take our head out on that son of a bitch.
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:45.000 They had also taken one prisoner as well the other platoon head.
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000 And so now he starts thinking back to the book.
01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000 This is it I thought.
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000 I'd been wounded four times in battle.
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000 I had done my job.
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000 Captain Cells had asked after my third wound if I wanted to be sent back.
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000 Anyone with three wounds was due that.
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000 All it took was two wounds to get you out of the field.
01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000 Surely forward let me live with myself.
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000 What was I trying to prove?
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000 But I answered my own question.
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000 The men depend on me.
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.000 It's my job to keep them alive by giving them good leadership and looking after them.
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000 They need me.
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000 Yeah, but shit.
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000 What did I owe myself?
01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000 I had a wife and two little girls who needed me.
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000 The $10,000 in insurance money wouldn't do them much good.
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000 Where did my duty lie?
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000 I was still shaking.
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000 I couldn't go through this again.
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000 Reluctantly almost against my wheel.
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000 I started walking toward the captain.
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000 Captain?
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000 Yes, Fred.
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000 You asked once if I wanted to go out of the field.
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000 If I'd been wounded a third time, he turned and looked into my face.
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000 Yes.
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000 Well, I think I mean, would you think I was letting you and my men down if I did?
01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000 I stammered?
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000 No, I wouldn't.
01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000 You've done your job.
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000 I could get you a job.
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000 Get you a good job with S2.
01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000 That's the intelligence back in the rear.
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000 I think I want out.
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000 I don't know if I can do this again.
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000 Maybe I can't cut it.
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000 That's nonsense.
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000 You're a hell of a fine officer and the men will understand, but you think about it.
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000 Okay, I will.
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000 Let me think.
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000 A little bit of confidence returned to his words.
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000 I handed you orders, things to him.
01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000 I wandered back to the packs thinking.
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000 I should find you orders pack.
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000 Bell had stood up and was coming toward me when he saw that blindfolded Dink.
01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000 In one motion, he swung his fist into the Dink's face.
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000 He hit him again and again knocking the surprise Dink down in a burst of fury.
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000 Bell started kicking him.
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000 It was obvious Bell was going to kill him.
01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000 The other men and I stood smoking and watching.
01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000 We were going to let Bell kill the Dink.
01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000 Bell had the right.
01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.000 Captain Cells yelled and ran over to us, pushing me out of the way.
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000 And pulling Bell off the Dink.
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000 Here, what's this?
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000 What's going on?
01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000 We are not going to have this in my company.
01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000 This man's a prisoner.
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000 Lieutenant Downs, what are you doing just standing there?
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000 I looked at him in surprise.
01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000 Bell was killing this motherfucker.
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000 What's wrong with that?
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000 I retorted.
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000 You know God damn well.
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000 What's a matter with that lieutenant?
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000 This man is defenseless and our prisoner.
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000 Now let's get this prisoner back to the L.D.
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000 L.Z.
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000 I wanted the Dink dead.
01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000 But the captain was right.
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000 So you can see there.
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000 Obviously, Captain Cells has a great head on his shoulders.
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000 And there's something else that play.
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:50.000 The other thing that's at play is that by function of the way the battle went down.
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:56.000 And by function of being one rank above the Ptum commanders that are in the firefights,
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000 guess what he is defecto.
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000 He's detached.
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000 He's detached.
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000 He didn't.
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000 I mean, Bell as the guy was pinned down almost got killed, right?
01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000 He's the guy that's emotional.
01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000 And guess who pulled him out, wrist his life lost,
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000 Yoda, that was down.
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000 So these guys are emotional.
01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000 They're, they're, they want to kill this guy.
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000 They captured him.
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000 He's VC.
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000 Let's kill him.
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.000 And Captain Cells is detached because he wasn't in that firefight.
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000 He wasn't directly there.
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:35.000 So he's able to maintain enough mental detachment to, to make a hard decision.
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000 But also hold the line.
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000 And this is something that, you know, when we go through the me lime ascertain,
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000 this could have happened over and over again.
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000 This could have happened to any, anywhere along the way.
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000 Someone could have said, hey, what are you doing right there?
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000 Stop.
01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000 We don't do that.
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000 And that's exactly what Cells does.
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000 And I think another thing that's important from a leadership perspective.
01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:01.000 Also, well, before I go to that point, you notice that when he's having the personal conversation
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:07.000 with Lieutenant Downey calls him Fred, but when he's screwing up and he needs to kind of put him in his place,
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000 he's Lieutenant Downey's.
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000 On top of that, from the leadership perspective, from Captain Cells perspective,
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000 he's got to always remember that what is happening,
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000 that they are emotional, that they did just lose their body.
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.000 He's got, he can't just, you know, be so on the straight narrow that goes, oh, I'm going to court Marshal you.
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000 He could court Marshal, right?
01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000 Hey, you abused a prisoner.
01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000 You're, you know, I'm going to court Marshal you.
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000 And he doesn't do that because he understands their perspective.
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000 And that's why, you know, again, throughout this book, Cells really impresses me as a,
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000 as a very square way good solid leader.
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000 As does Downs.
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000 I mean, Downs, obviously right here, he's emotional.
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000 And he's lost it.
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000 He's, he's, he's cross the line, right?
01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000 But all it takes is Cells just to get back over here, buddy.
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000 You cross the line, come back and he says the captain was right.
01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000 So that's all it took, just a little snap, just to get him to attach a little bit for the emotions
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:14.000 and, and move move away from the darkness.
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000 Back to the book, I walked over to the bodies.
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000 The odors eyes were partially shut and I leaned down to push them close, not that it didn't
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000 be good, but for some reason, I thought it was better that way.
01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.000 I stood there with one hand on my aching hip, smoking and thinking.
01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:38.000 The odors face was all muddy from the numerous times he'd been dropped in the mud, and it was a trickle of blood at the base of his throat.
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000 This is the way it will always end, I thought.
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.000 Men being killed in the jungle, other men dragging their bodies out, putting them on choppers,
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000 and the rest of us going back to the fighting.
01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000 When they left on the chopper, it was as if they had never been.
01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:00.000 Men's beginning and men's end would always be attended by only a few.
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000 Those that bore them at birth and those that bore them at death.
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000 The only important thing was what he did in between.
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000 Good or bad or indifferent.
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.000 Touch those around him in some way and then be gone.
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:27.000 I wondered if a salute would be in order, not necessarily in the military sense, but a salute from one who had known him and who had never forget him.
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:37.000 I decided it was and I raised my hand to my forehead in a farewell.
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:42.000 Now the birds come in and pick them up as after he gives that final salute to Yoder.
01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000 Smoke was popped and the large choppers swung in towards us for his landing.
01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.000 The doors were pushed back and I saw the door gunner on the side facing me looking around, angiously searching for the ominous,
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000 for the omnipresent enemy.
01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.000 Good man, I thought, not trusting a goddamn thing even with an American infantry company surrounding the LZ.
01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:10.000 I love that. He's noticing that this door gunner is coming in and he's coming in and picking up and instead of this guy cut in corners.
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000 I mean, I got this thing in front of me and there's no rounds being fired.
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000 I'm just going to relax and know this guy's in the game opens the door.
01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:27.000 Doesn't want to say he says not trusting a goddamn thing even with an American infantry company on the LZ.
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:34.000 Many thoughts were criss-crossing my mind above everything else ran the thought that I could not abandon my men.
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.000 I felt that shame that I had asked Captain Cells to pull me out of the field earlier when I was still shaken.
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000 What would the men think if they found out I was doing such a thing?
01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000 Worse, what would I think of myself?
01:12:48.000 --> 01:13:05.000 Now they continue to do operations and eventually they get pulled out of the field on this for the final time on a helicopter back to the book.
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000 The machine carried us away.
01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000 I looked over my men sprawled along the sides of the chopper.
01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000 They didn't remove the magazines from their weapons before boarding and now we're holding them close to their bodies.
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:24.000 The men were dirty and unshaven, their clothes and various stages of disrepair, jungle boots worn and torn with claws and mud between the cleats.
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000 There were dark rings under their eyes and their faces were drawn and tired.
01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:37.000 Some of those faces were new men, sent out to a place that started the operation in where they were erased.
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000 We had experienced the worst of life and the most challenging.
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000 We had survived.
01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:49.000 The platoon I took back was not the platoon I had brought out.
01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.000 Now they're on yet another operation.
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:05.000 If they go back they get reset and they're out on another operation.
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.000 Doing a patrol and I'm going back to the book about five meters past the gate.
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000 The two men turned to me and waved me forward. All clear, sir. Let's go, Rudo.
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:21.000 I passed through the gate. My right hand grasped my M16, my left held my cigarette.
01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000 I was humming the blue tail fly as I mentally ticked off the positions around the saddle where I would set my men.
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000 I noticed the time.
01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000 07.45 hours.
01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:38.000 My foot slipped backwards a fraction of an inch hitting the trigger mechanism of a mine.
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000 I never heard the explosion.
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.000 Black powder and dirt flew by me. My ear drums ripped.
01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000 My body was flying through the air. I threw my arms in front of me and a reflex motion to balance myself.
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:59.000 My eyes registered the horror of a brilliantly white jagged bone sticking out of the stump of arm above where my left elbow had been.
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000 Ragged bloody flesh around at the splintered bone.
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.000 My mind cursed as utter helplessness and disrepair and despair overwhelmed me.
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.000 Another part of my body coolly calculated what it caused the explosion.
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.000 It had been a landmine. But what kind would blow off my arm instead of my legs?
01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:24.000 Of course, it had to be a bouncing beddy. A mine that flies up to out of the ground after being tripped and explodes waste high.
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000 That would do it.
01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:33.000 My I'm 16 had been in my right hand. The rifle was shattered. My hand was mangled.
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:42.000 I stared in horror at what remained of my right arm. The flesh had been ripped away exposing two bones in my white forearm from wrist to the elbow.
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:48.000 The bones look like two white glistening, narrow rods buried in raw bloody meat.
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:58.000 Thinking my god, my god, my god, I felt told defeat of my life as I landed on my feet five yards from where the mine exploded.
01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:04.000 After landing, I staggered forward two or three steps and then collapsed. My legs wouldn't work.
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000 The mine had gone off about six inches from my left hip.
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:17.000 From the waist down my body was mutilated and torn where large chunks of flesh, muscles, blood vessels and nerves had been ripped away by the hot exploding shrapnel.
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:23.000 My buttocks were blown away. The back of my legs were ripped to the bone down to my heels.
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000 I rolled over on my back being careful to keep my stump and right arm out of the dirt and sand.
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:34.000 My body was sending so many pain signals to my brain that it overloaded like an electrical circuit.
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000 It caused me to feel a racing, humming, numbness.
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000 I lifted my head to view a scene from hell.
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:50.000 I watched a couple of men run by me to the wounded point man. They would only glance at my, at me sideways as I lay there holding my bloody stump in the air.
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000 They seem nervous.
01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:58.000 Some of my men ran toward me, then turned suddenly away at the sight of my torn body.
01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.000 They stood near me but hesitated to come too close as if their movement through the air would make it worse.
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:12.000 Spag asked me to turn sideways a little bit so he could pull my gear off. There were tears as eyes as he worked over me.
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.000 With a grunt he pulled the belt out from under me.
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:25.000 Is there anything I can do for you? Spag asked, yes run over there and pick up my arm and bring it back to me. I don't want to leave it in this stinking village.
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.000 I told Marley to get my squad leaders. Go take care of the other men dock. They need you.
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:39.000 I looked up. Marley and my squad leaders were standing in a rough line along my right side. I asked who was hurt. I was feeling weaker and weaker. It was so goddamn cold.
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:46.000 As my body fought for life, my thoughts ran to my man and my platoon. I felt I was cheating them by leaving them when they needed me most.
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.000 When I joined the platoon as their leader, they had taught me the ways to survive in combat.
01:17:51.000 --> 01:18:01.000 A second lieutenant who was new in country and they were old timers, 18, 19, 20, but old to the ways of combat and death.
01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:12.000 As I gained experience and confidence as a leader, I became an old timer. Having to make decisions that put me in the position I was in now wounded and maimed facing death.
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:20.000 My men were still up there looking at me, despair on their faces. Their invulnerable leader had been brought down.
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:34.000 Marley, yes sir, I want you to your men to get the dink who planted that mine. I want them dead. Get them. We will once six. Don't you worry about that. They looked at each other. Then back at me.
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:43.000 The gray haze of the day was strong. I pushed it back to look beyond my men. It was colder now and harder to see.
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:53.000 I was thinking of my grandma down and her farm of the woods and fields of Indiana. I loved so much. If only I could walk them one more time.
01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:10.000 I'm only 23 years old and I'm dying. What a waste. There are so many things I had meant to do and say, but I hadn't. Now I will never get the chance.
01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:25.000 So, obviously, although he thought he was going to die, he lived. He lost his arm. He ended up with severe wounds.
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:38.000 He got discharged from the army. That's one of the things in the story. He had actually got picked up for pilot program. He's going to be a pilot. He's going to stay in the army. He's going to be a pilot.
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:54.000 Obviously, that was gone because he didn't have an arm anymore. Luckily, he was able to save his other arm. But severe wounds were long rehab. Eventually, he ends up going back to college.
01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:09.000 And here we go back to the book. In the fall of 1968, as I stopped at a traffic light on my walk to class across the campus of the University of Denver, a man stepped up to me and said, hi.
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:23.000 Without waiting for my reply to his greeting, he pointed to the hooks taking out of my left sleeve. Get that in Vietnam. I said, yeah, up near Tam Kay and one corps serves you right.
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:45.000 As the man walked away, I still rooted, too confused with hurt, shame and anger to react. Ten years have passed. The hurt, shame and anger still flood over me with the memory. But one thing I am certain.
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:57.000 None of the men I knew who served in Vietnam deserved a dire to be maimed either physically or mentally. I think it is necessary now to give Vietnam to give another view of Vietnam.
01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:09.000 That of the day-to-day life of an infantry man on the ground. I have always been asked what I thought about Vietnam, but never when it was like to fight in Vietnam.
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:24.000 This is the way it was for us, the platoon of Delta 16.
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:39.000 And in the afterward, he talks about why he wrote this book. In writing the killing zone, I had two goals.
01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:46.000 I wanted future young infantry lieutenant and non-commissioned officers to learn from my experiences, both good and bad.
01:21:46.000 --> 01:22:03.000 Some actions I took as a combat officer had worked out well and some had not. The time had come to deal with both. Perhaps some would learn from my mistakes, especially the lessons that combat, especially the lesson that combat does not go by the book.
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:20.000 I also wanted to show future generations that the American soldier in Vietnam was a good soldier. In 1978, the anti-war anti-military feeling in the United States was pervasive in the newspapers on television, among writers and movies and colleges.
01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:38.000 I had started college at the University of Denver in the fall of 1968 while I was still on active duty in the military. The students for a democratic society, the weathermen and other anti-war groups on campus targeted anyone in the military as fair game for their anti-war stance.
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:54.000 Such hostility was not pleasant for me or other Vietnam veterans. It was hard to be denigrated for serving your country. Many veterans have never had never had never had been in the service for many years after Vietnam.
01:22:54.000 --> 01:23:08.000 Angry at the anti-war faction, I wanted to set the record straight by proving that the men I served with had fought and died with honor.
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:32.000 And here are the men that died and made the ultimate sacrifice for freedom and for their brothers in arms from Delta Company, first battalion of the 14th Infantry, third brigade, fourth infantry division.
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:46.000 PFC Donald Lawrence Glover, PFC Norman Charles Kissinger, PFC Robert Wayne Seaton,
01:23:46.000 --> 01:24:06.000 Speck 4 Gregory Thomas Eiding, Speck 4 Charles Irwin Edwin Doc Hoffman, PFC James Garrett Miller,
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:26.000 Speck 4 James Strong Yoder, PFC William Henry Hark, Speck 4 Stephen Richard Anderson, Speck 4 Lewis Charles Nelson,
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:41.000 Second Lieutenant William Dwight Ordway, PFC Paul James Miller, Speck 4 Jose Cortez,
01:24:41.000 --> 01:25:10.000 PFC Charles Peter Torleyett, and Second Lieutenant John C. Martin. So Fred Downs, Second Lieutenant asked us to do two things in this book, first learned from his experiences.
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:23.000 The mistakes, the lessons, and that is what we do here. We read and we study and we think and we learn.
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:33.000 And the second thing he asks is that we remember the man who fought and died with honor.
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:48.000 And that's something that we need to do and we should continue to do each and every day. Remember.
01:25:48.000 --> 01:26:01.000 And that is one thing about this podcast that has a lot of meaning to me.
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:12.000 It's the fact that people are listening to it and the memory of these types of men and the challenges that they face, it will be remembered.
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:30.000 They will be remembered. Always.
01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:42.000 So once again, the book is called the killing zone, my life in the Vietnam War by Frederick Downs.
01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:59.000 It's a fantastic read, it's a fantastic book, it's a fantastic dedication and it doesn't incredible job of honoring these men that fought so hard in a very unpopular war.
01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:09.000 And by the book and read it, you will absolutely get a lot out of it.
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.000 Echo Charles.
01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:20.000 I believe we can move on to the next sector of this podcast.
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:43.000 And again, if nothing else is delivered through this podcast, you know, let's let it be these couple things, these couple ideas of learning lessons from other people's experiences and remembering other people sacrifices.
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:53.000 That's definitely one of the driving forces behind my will to do this podcast.
01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:58.000 And we're going to keep doing the podcast. Echo, get me out of here, please.
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:01.000 I'm in that zone right now.
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.000 I need to send up a red star cluster. You know what that is?
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:12.000 So in the military, when you need help, it's a red star cluster. It's a flare. You pop up and it means you couldn't communicate with anybody and you need some help.
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:19.000 So there's my red star cluster. You need to jump in and say, hey, jockel speaking to the podcast.
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:28.000 Here's how we can support it. So talk about that while I get over here and get myself under control before I start smashing things.
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:35.000 All right. Yeah. If you want to send any reinforcements to support jockel in our podcast here.
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:43.000 While supporting yourself with supplementation, by the way, good idea. Go to on it.com slash jockel.
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:47.000 So on it has like these supplements that we take supplements.
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000 You're joined, krill oil boom,
01:28:49.000 --> 01:29:04.000 shrimp tech for performance, hard stuff, you know, crossfit to jitsu. If you're trying to go hard, you know hardcore in the paint. Yeah, shrimp tech boom.
01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:09.000 Also, if you do your shopping at Amazon, which I think we all do.
01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:15.000 Go ahead and click through our website. We have a little link there. You know, you can support it that way.
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:26.000 That's a super easy way. I only got to do this. Remember to do it before you shop. That is helpful. Yeah. Very much so we also have a new tool.
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:35.000 Because can you can you make them remembering part of a little bit easier? Yes. So when, you know, you figure hey.
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:40.000 I got to remember to go to the website before I shop on Amazon.
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:49.000 Sometimes I'm in a hurry, whatever. Maybe I'm thinking about other stuff. I'm not thinking about jocgos podcast every single day all day.
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000 I got to buy some, you know, some cleaner or some duct tape, whatever.
01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:02.000 Here's a way. So it helps you remember and or makes you not have to remember. You know, it's this little tool called the trooper tool.
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:14.000 Jocopotcaster. Pretty cool. Thanks to Brady for that one. Brady. Proxy. It's a cool little thing. It's like this small little thing is pretty cool. You click on there's a little link on both websites. So you click on the thing.
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:27.000 It asks you if you want it. You click yes. Put the little icon there on your browser and it basically directs you to the affiliate Amazon link automatically.
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.000 You've got to think yeah, it's dope. And that's that's a really easy way to support the podcast.
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:42.000 Yeah. And the, the, it doesn't cost you anything. It costs Amazon. And it seems to me like Amazon can afford to kick a little bit to the podcast over here.
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:52.000 Right. Yeah. And it's really, it does serve its purpose because you know, Amazon, you know, like Amazon there, you know, they're a good company provides good stuff, good service and all that.
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:58.000 And they're trying to get the word up. And you know, they, they partner with people who can get the word out.
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:04.000 Yeah. And there's people that are going to go, you know what, I want to support the podcast. So I will buy this and set a buying it through some other website.
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:14.000 They're going to go to the, the store that's going to support something that they enjoy or something that they get value out of hopefully from this podcast. So yeah, that's an awesome way to support. We appreciate it.
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:28.000 And it makes it like, it's kind of, this little tool is kind of cool because it kind of makes it official, you know, like if you're, I mean, if you're one of the people that that listen to this and really talk with us and stuff, it's a cool way to kind of be more part of the group I guess.
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.000 It seems like it when I put my in up there, I'm like, hey, you know, I'm like fish. I don't know, I felt like I gave it.
01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000 Yeah.
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000 Echo Charles is in the game.
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:43.000 No, we dig that. So yeah, it's a, it's a really cool tool. You don't have to, it's safe. It's not like this. You just put it on. If you don't want it on there anymore, whatever reason.
01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:56.000 Right click it right click. And it could you made a little video that shows you go to the Jockel podcast YouTube channel and echo Charles made a video of very high speed instructional video on how to do this.
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000 Oh, I didn't turn away.
01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:13.000 But it's really easy. You are not playing around with the instructional video. I think that was very impressive. And by the way, subscribe to me a favor, to subscribe to the YouTube channel, the the Jockel podcast YouTube channel.
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:25.000 That way, when echo because I'm been, I've been hacking on echo to make little outtakes and other little conversations and videos and he's like, well, you know, we got some subscribers, but maybe, you know, if we had some more, maybe I'd be more.
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:51.000 So we need to motivate echo Charles just a little bit because so we could get some outtake videos, some other other interesting videos. I wanted to do a little preview today of what it was like when we're getting set up because we have a little ritual that we go through when we're making some some beverages, you know, some alpha brainy and we have, you know, so I was like, I'd be pretty cool if you shot a little video and he's like, well, you know, maybe one day.
01:32:51.000 --> 01:33:02.000 I mean, right now. No, I actually am am a teenager. So subscribe to the, I don't think it doesn't, I mean, just just go to go to the Jockel podcast channel on YouTube. Subscribe.
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:17.000 Yeah, I think it's YouTube.com slash Jockel podcast. And also, what's cool about that is when you do that, then you get little emails that say, not like you just get an email, it says, hey, Jockel podcast just uploaded a new video. I get those and I'm always like, oh, yeah, cool. Now I can watch the video.
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:34.000 Even that's optional. Okay. If you want to opt out, but yeah, that's a good and I have a member that that one child children's book idea. I had yeah, you probably forget because no, you need to remind me I got a lot of ideas. I have that. I had that on video when we're talking anyway.
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:43.000 Oh, yeah, that'd be funny. Yeah. So yeah, some of some things you got to understand. So I have a certain stand. This is not talking to you. I'm talking to people that are listening right now.
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:58.000 I mean, you're here too. So I guess I'm talking to you too, but people got to understand that there's a certain expectation in my mind of what the podcast is and what it's supposed to be. So when something happens, that's not quite there.
01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:12.000 I'm like, you know what, I don't really, hey, you know, I don't want to talk about that on the podcast, but this, like, for instance, before we hit record, we're recording, but before we go before I open the show, we're talking about something.
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:25.000 We're always talking about something. And sometimes those conversations are 20 minutes, half an hour. We're talking about real stuff. We're talking about legit things, but we haven't even introduced the podcast yet. So that goes in the scrap pile.
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:41.000 Right. Now some of the scrap mile material while it might not be in March, Marching step with what the podcast is. It does perhaps have a, have a life that it could live and it could guide people in a certain way.
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:53.000 And it's stuff that people might be interested in. So that could be the YouTube download, you know, YouTube just post on there. So that way people get a little taste of other things around the podcast, which I think people would.
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:59.000 Yeah, that makes sense. So like, you know, if you free your mind, you know, Charles, free your mind.
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000 Yeah, you're totally right.
01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000 Well, thank you. Thank you.
01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000 What's for once?
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:07.000 Yeah.
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:19.000 Yeah, because you know, if you listen to it on iTunes, you're like, why am I going to sit and watch Echo and John's with talk to each other? You know, I listened to one and I got to look at them to you know, a lot of people might not be interested in that.
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:26.000 There's some really, there's some moments. You know what I do is I, well, I watch certain moments of the podcast on YouTube.
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:27.000 Yeah.
01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:35.000 Like when I know I was feeling intense about something, I go and see what it, see what that looks like. See, like, okay, what does that look like when I'm feeling that?
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:41.000 Does it look like, does it look like from the outside? What it feels like from the inside?
01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:55.000 Because even today, I was getting pretty fired up. Like, I mean, you're talking about heroes and young man, man, 18, 19, 20 years old that said, okay, this unpopular war, I'll go fight it.
01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:04.000 Yeah, I'll go fight it. You know, I'll go risk my life. I'll go out there in the jungle and live in, you know, I was, I was out this week in the field.
01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:11.000 Right, camping. I kept putting in quotes on Twitter. I was putting in quotes because I was like, I can't call this the field.
01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:22.000 But you know, it wasn't the comfort of a house, right? It was in it was in it was, you know, bugs and ants and I'm like thinking myself, you know, this is nothing.
01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.000 And I was thinking back to, to the forgotten highlander.
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:53.000 And remember the bugs were just eating those guys alive. And you know, you just, you just can't, you can't compare. So these guys that, that just stepped up fought, just want to, I just want to always, you know, that kind of thing will get me fired up. So when I go back to the videos, sometimes I go, man, what was I looking like right?
01:36:53.000 --> 01:37:02.000 You know, little self assessment. And I wonder if, you know, because when I'm feeling that way, I'm like, okay, you got to attach a little bit because you're starting to get a little bit fired up.
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:09.000 And let's start breaking and start getting like really emotional about something. So I got to, I got a red flag goes up. I go to you get a back off a little bit here.
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000 We don't have to edit the video if I break down.
01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.000 So I got to just back off and sometimes I got to see what does that look like. Does it look, can you tell?
01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:24.000 Am I looking, you know, so that's the kind of thing that I like to go back and look at the YouTube videos and say, you know, what does this look like?
01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:31.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, this rebellion. There's a lot of value on YouTube that I'm, we're probably not, you know, capitalizing.
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000 I don't know, but I prefer it for you.
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000 Yeah, who care?
01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.000 And it's weird too because the interesting thing about this is you use the word capitalized, right?
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.000 In the fact of the matter is, we don't really capitalizing on this at all.
01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:51.000 And I keep getting told by a variety of different people what to do to you to do what that right there, to capitalize.
01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.000 I meant it to just capitalize not for us to come up with.
01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:02.000 Yeah, I know for everybody, you know, people know what we, what we want to do is we want to maximize the effort that we put in here.
01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000 Want to maximize some of the people get the most out of it.
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000 Yeah, that's what I know that's what you meant.
01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:11.000 I know you didn't mean like let's run the cash machine because we're doing it for the passion of doing it.
01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:17.000 That's what I'm sitting here for sitting here so I can tell so I can tell this story right here about these guys.
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.000 Yeah.
01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:21.000 And I know, you know, I know I get, I hear from all kinds of cops.
01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:25.000 I hear from my, my seal buddies that are still in that are listening to it that are,
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000 ask me, text me questions going, hey man, what's going on with us?
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000 Hey, what would you do differently here?
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000 Hey, those are my buddies that are in that are getting ready to deploy overseas right now.
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:40.000 And I get texts and emails and Twitter things from guys that were guys that are act duty and the Marine Corps and the army.
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:46.000 So I know that we're getting the word out there and that's what that's what I'm sitting here for.
01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:47.000 Yeah.
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:53.000 Yeah. And you make a good point with, you know, there's a lot of people who don't watch the video.
01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000 Of course.
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000 That's what they said.
01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000 I mean, I don't watch podcasts videos.
01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:57.000 Right.
01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:01.000 I mean, why, why, why, why, you know, the reason podcasts are so convenient is that you can be doing something else.
01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000 Yes.
01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000 You don't have to dedicate, you have to dedicate your all your senses to it.
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.000 You only have to dedicate two of them, your ears and your brain.
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:09.000 Yeah.
01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000 But you don't have to dedicate your eyes.
01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.000 You don't have to dedicate your ass to sit down and chair and watch something.
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000 You can walk around.
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.000 You can do yard work.
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:16.000 You can drive.
01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:17.000 You can do what you got to do.
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000 Yeah.
01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:21.000 But I think the shorter little YouTube clips where you go, hey, check this out.
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:26.000 This is when Jocquan, I were discussing a kids book that Echo was talking about or
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:27.000 Good idea, I know it.
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.000 Yeah.
01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000 I don't know.
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:29.000 Yeah.
01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000 Post that thing up.
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:30.000 Yeah.
01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:37.000 And it's interesting because a lot of people apparently don't, I mean, don't our surprise that I look different than I sound.
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000 Yeah.
01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000 I guess.
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:39.000 Oh, yeah.
01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000 They think you're a skinny white hipster.
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.000 Or yeah.
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.000 That's what they think you are.
01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:44.000 Maybe I have that heart.
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:45.000 Maybe you are at heart.
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.000 You're just trapped.
01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000 Maybe you identify as a skinny white hipster.
01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000 Maybe you know you're a, a 220.
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000 I don't know.
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.000 I don't, I don't identify myself by my physical characterist.
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.000 I like that.
01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000 It's what's in my heart in my mind.
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000 The content of your character is new.
01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:02.000 Yeah.
01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.000 I'm telling them I'm like, you're saying.
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000 Yeah.
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.000 I think the YouTube I just get idea.
01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000 Yeah.
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.000 Yeah.
01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.000 Yeah.
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000 Yeah.
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:10.000 Yeah.
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:11.000 Yeah.
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:12.000 From when we were filming commercials and stuff.
01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.000 Oh, right.
01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000 Yeah.
01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.000 Yeah.
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.000 Those were good.
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.000 All right.
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:17.000 Anything else?
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000 Jocka you in.
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000 Jocka store.
01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000 Did you talk about that?
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000 Yeah.
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.000 Go to the store.
01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.000 Buy some, buy some merch.
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000 Somebody hit me up on Twitter the other day.
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000 And they're like, hey, you should set up, we got to ask this bunch of times.
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.000 Set up a Patreon.
01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.000 Patry on.
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000 Is that what it's called?
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000 Patreon.
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000 Patreon.
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.000 Where you can donate to the podcast, certain amount.
01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.000 And I just said, hey, man, go buy a t-shirt.
01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000 You know, that supports us just as well.
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.000 And you get a t-shirt.
01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000 And that's a good way to support the podcast.
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:46.000 You buy some merchandise.
01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.000 Buy some deer.
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.000 Right.
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.000 Yeah.
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.000 The Jocka store.
01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:51.000 That's a good one.
01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.000 T-shirts.
01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000 Coffee mugs.
01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000 Stickers.
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000 Those are kind of cool.
01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000 One of my friends saw two Jocka stickers in the wild.
01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000 In the wild.
01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.000 Yeah.
01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000 Or maybe there's a little one on the other.
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000 Yeah.
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:05.000 And then you go, everyone in San Diego, we know where everyone in San Diego doesn't count.
01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.000 I don't know.
01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:07.000 Yeah.
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000 I don't see it.
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000 I don't believe that.
01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.000 It counts.
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.000 Oh, but yeah.
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.000 Awesome.
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.000 It's good.
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:18.000 So now we get to those questions from the inner webs.
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.000 First question.
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:30.000 Jocka is a minimal amount of competent defensive ability soft defense.
01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000 Essentially.
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:39.000 The most overlooked essential stabilizer of young male psyche.
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:40.000 So this question.
01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.000 This actually came across the interwebs as a statement.
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000 An opinion.
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000 And I kind of rephrase it just a little bit to make it into a question.
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000 But it actually came across someone who's in look.
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:57.000 He believes this person believes that they know and how to fight.
01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000 You know, competent defensive ability.
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:06.000 I call that knowing how to fight is, and he thinks it's the most essential stabilizer of a young male psyche.
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:09.000 I agree with this statement.
01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:12.000 I think that, yeah, I completely agree with it.
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:21.000 I think that learning how to fight and knowing how to fight gives you real confidence and security,
01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:28.000 not just in the form of being secure, but as a in opposition to insecurity, right?
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:33.000 Because when you know how to fight, all of a sudden you don't have anything to prove anymore.
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000 And this changes.
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000 I wish I would have been going to do that a fight and a much more.
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000 We fought all the time when I was a kid.
01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:41.000 We fought.
01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.000 We did not have a fight.
01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000 So what do we have to prove that we knew how to fight?
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000 If we actually knew how to fight, we wouldn't have to prove that all the time.
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000 So I absolutely agree with this.
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:55.000 And that's why I'm constantly trying to get people to get energy.
01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:01.000 Get your kids energy, get your 13 year old boy, your 10 year old boy, get him into your jitsu.
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000 You're girl too.
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.000 I mean, you're girl too.
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.000 Because your girl's going to use it for defense.
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:12.000 Girls don't have the constant tension of fighting that guys have.
01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000 It is part of who we are.
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:21.000 When I shake someone's hand, I don't care what kind of mood I'm thinking about taking them down.
01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000 I'm thinking about what I'm going to do to them in a fight.
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000 It doesn't matter from meeting Santa Claus.
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000 I'm thinking about doing a double leg.
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000 I'm thinking about what is weight is.
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.000 Does he have cauliflower?
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:31.000 That's what I'm doing.
01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000 And guys do that.
01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000 Guys do that.
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000 And it's real.
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000 And I mean, especially in the environment, I grew up in the civil teams.
01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.000 I mean, everybody's got that constant.
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000 Like tests.
01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000 That's the evaluation.
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.000 So if you don't know how to fight, there's only one way to figure out where you are.
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:54.000 And that is to fight.
01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000 And so you end up doing stupid things.
01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:00.000 Stupid things to prove your your manhood.
01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.000 And I hate to use that word.
01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000 But you end up doing stupid things to prove your manhood.
01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.000 So my recommendation is, well, I totally agree with this statement.
01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:13.000 I think it is a huge stabilizer of your personality.
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:16.000 And and your psyche has a man.
01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:19.000 So kids get those kids to learn GJitsu.
01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.000 They're going to understand.
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000 Violence. You respect it.
01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000 Because you know you've got choked out.
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000 You know what's happened.
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000 You know that is a horrible feeling.
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:36.000 It's a horrible feeling when another human being can control you a hundred percent.
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:37.000 You know what?
01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000 Physically it doesn't matter how smart you are anymore.
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000 I'm sorry. It doesn't matter.
01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:43.000 It doesn't matter.
01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000 It doesn't matter how smart you are anymore.
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:48.000 When you are getting completely physically dominated by someone,
01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.000 it doesn't matter that you are smarter than them.
01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:52.000 At that time it's nothing you can do about it.
01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000 You can, what are you going to challenge them to a spelling bee?
01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000 It's not going to help you.
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000 You're under there controlling.
01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:01.000 That's a horrible horrible feeling.
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.000 And so I think it's, you know, and I felt that you know when I was a kid,
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.000 you know, I got bullied just like everybody gets bullied at sort of certain point.
01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.000 You know, you show up to high school.
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000 You're 13 years old.
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:09.000 I was there.
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:10.000 I was a young.
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000 Whatever.
01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000 However, that works when you are born.
01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.000 That was born September.
01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:17.000 So I was a young scrawny.
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:18.000 Kid.
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:21.000 And I didn't get bullied to some crazy extent.
01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000 But you get picked on.
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:24.000 You get picked on.
01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.000 You get in the little scuffles and you get thrown around by a kid that's that reach
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.000 puberty when he was nine and he's now, you know, six feet to 20.
01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:37.000 And I'm showing up at school 13 years old way in a buck 45.
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.000 You're going to get, you're going to get physically controlled.
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000 And it's not fun.
01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:45.000 And so I didn't know.
01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:48.000 I was trying to figure it out.
01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:52.000 And there was no one to know how to fight back then unless you were a boxer, maybe a wrestler.
01:45:52.000 --> 01:46:01.000 But yeah, so definitely this is a huge piece helps you with, I think, I think kids that know how to fight are going to get in the lost less street fights.
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.000 They're going to do a lot less stupid things to prove themselves because,
01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.000 guess what, they already have the essential.
01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:16.000 I'm all animalistic characteristic of physical domination and that goes a long way.
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:17.000 Yeah.
01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.000 And we talked about this before.
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:24.000 Back to the girls thing, getting your girls into it.
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.000 You know how when you get into any kind of physical situation, even if you're in a crowd.
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000 And some of them start shoving someone else, not even you.
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:36.000 And pull them you feel the force of somebody or someone's just all like on you or even if someone like,
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:41.000 I don't know, tackles you or something like that. It's like this kind of imposed physical situation.
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:44.000 And when you're into the Gigi, that's every day.
01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000 So you get used to that real quick.
01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000 And in fact, you get real comfortable with it.
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000 But as a girl, you're not trying to like win fight now.
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.000 You know, I know Gigi, so I'm going to try win fights and beat up guys.
01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000 That's not really what it's for for girls.
01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:03.000 It's more for knowing how to function, knowing where to be, where not to be because man, if you don't know, you just simply don't know.
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:08.000 And also being totally right and then also being an accolade to the physical con.
01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:09.000 Yeah, when it happens.
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.000 So what you say, you can't win, I mean, not looking to win fights.
01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:13.000 There's go watch YouTube.
01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.000 There's all kinds of videos of girls just working over guys.
01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:21.000 And I mean, in street fights, there's one particular where this girls just try to,
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000 our mock just choke.
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.000 Just crushing this kid.
01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:30.000 Yeah, well, the truth is, if you learn Gigi, if someone knows Gigi,
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.000 if someone doesn't, the chance of the person knowing Gigi,
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000 who winning the fight is very, very, very high.
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:38.000 Yes, even if you're a girl, it's still applies to you.
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.000 Of course, the girls at a physical disadvantage could be smaller, weaker, whatever.
01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:48.000 But like I said, Gigi, who's just this huge jump in ability is for his fights go.
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.000 And you know something else, from a pure self defense perspective,
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:57.000 if you, a lot of times, let's say a girl's not able to physically,
01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:02.000 let's say she's 100 pounds and she's a guy attacks her, that's 200 pounds.
01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:05.000 She might not be able to put him asleep.
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.000 She might not be able to finish him, but she may able to be able to survive,
01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:15.000 defend the guy off for a minute and 30 seconds instead of two seconds,
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000 instead of four seconds instead of eight seconds.
01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000 So that's what it takes for someone to hear for someone to see.
01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000 So every second counts.
01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000 And if you know Gigi, I guarantee you,
01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:30.000 it's, it's really hard to subdue somebody that knows some Gigi to if you don't know anything.
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000 You are going to have a hard time getting control them.
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000 They're going to be, and even if you're stronger than them, you'll be able to get a hold of them.
01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000 Maybe eventually if there are a lot smaller, a lot weaker than you,
01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:40.000 but it's going to be a fight.
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.000 And a lot of, a lot of you know, you read a lot of stories when in self defense situations,
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.000 if the girl puts up a decent fight, the guy is not going to have any of it.
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000 You know, he's going to realize that he's not looking for that.
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000 He's not looking for a fight.
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:52.000 He's looking for something else.
01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000 And so the fight begins, he backs off.
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:58.000 So yeah, absolutely, you know, applies for girls as well.
01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.000 And there's just a certain level of confidence.
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.000 You know, when I've seen that, you know, my son's had a couple little scuffles,
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:08.000 a couple that I've witnessed too, where, you know,
01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000 he just was like not trying to,
01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.000 not trying to have a problem until someone just grabs him.
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000 And is obviously going to do trying to do something to him.
01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:18.000 And then that person's getting launched, you know, like,
01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000 a perfect judo, because you're going to, you know,
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:23.000 how hard is it to judo throw somebody that doesn't know any judo to do to it?
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:24.000 So easy.
01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000 So you see a kid fly through the air, hit the ground.
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.000 You see my son, you know, just, like, there's no guard passing,
01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000 because the person doesn't even know what the guard is.
01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000 So it's just straight to mount.
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:34.000 And then once you're in mount,
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000 the person has no idea what's happening.
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000 And, and they're completely controlled and they're getting put to sleep.
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:40.000 That's it.
01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.000 It's as easy as that.
01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:45.000 Yeah, and it's so funny how you, this is the kind of the part that I forget,
01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.000 actually, every once in a while, where how you brought up
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:51.000 when you shake someone's hand, you're always thinking about it, whatever.
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:55.000 So that's, that's something too. That's why it's almost like if you don't know
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000 judo to, like, or for real fighting,
01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000 there's not many out there, and there's not many, but even,
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000 we'll just say, if you don't know judo to,
01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.000 you might fall into this trap by thinking, well, you know,
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000 I might, you know, you never know.
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.000 He's not on all the time, or he might not be ready for this,
01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000 or, you know, all surprised him of the, like,
01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.000 this punch or something like this, and they won't give it its due credit.
01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:19.000 But the thing is when you learn judo to Brad, that's all you're thinking about.
01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000 You're like, oh, fuck, I take this guy right here.
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.000 100% of the time. You can be laying in your, in your bed with your wife,
01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000 and she'll be like, hey, give me a hug, and you're like,
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.000 100, 100, 100, there, yes, exactly the whole time.
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:34.000 So you can't really, to surprise a guy who knows,
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:37.000 you just, to surprise him is super hard.
01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000 Like, you gotta do, from behind, I don't know,
01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:42.000 even if you see him from behind, you know what to do from behind.
01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000 You know, you gotta, like, I don't know,
01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000 hit him or something, really hard to knock him out one punch.
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:50.000 It's really hard to knock somebody out within the punch for me.
01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.000 Yeah, but that's so funny, because that, that is how it is.
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:58.000 Even as like a high level guy, you're still like,
01:50:58.000 --> 01:50:59.000 it's always on your mind.
01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000 Like, it's like you're walking around with this big,
01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000 powerful, like, gun or something, like you're like,
01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000 okay, who wants to get shot?
01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000 Not that you want to shoot people specifically,
01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000 but it's like this radar that's like, okay,
01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.000 who wants to get shot. Kind of thing.
01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:15.000 Because you're just ready, you're just ready to do it.
01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:20.000 Yeah, and to me, honestly, it's so instinctive at this point.
01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:25.000 Yeah, it's just part of every movement that you make is thinking about that.
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:28.000 And you know, you ever had somebody that doesn't know you did to,
01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000 like, maybe you haven't seen someone in a while.
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000 I've had that app, what I've seen seen someone for a while.
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000 Yes.
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.000 And I mean, 20 years.
01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000 So they have no idea what you did to us.
01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000 We've got a completely different path in our lives.
01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:41.000 And they like, grab hold of you as if it was the old days.
01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000 And you're going to have a tussle and it's edible.
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:50.000 Yeah, it's just a four second, you know, spirit crushing maneuver of death.
01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:51.000 Yeah.
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000 And you're happy to do it too.
01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000 You know, because as an adult, like, you know,
01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.000 I think anywhere past 26, 27 years old,
01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000 it's hard to get away with like, getting into a wrestling match in public,
01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000 or, you know, somewhere outside of the map.
01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:04.000 That's interesting.
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000 You might not have known that.
01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000 But, yeah.
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000 I don't know, I think I speak for more than more people than just myself,
01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000 but there's a part of your mind that kind of helped it.
01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.000 It happens just with your friend, you know, or something like that.
01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000 Just see, you do it, of course.
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:20.000 Always, always hoping for a scrap.
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:23.000 You know what, ironically, back to the part where we're saying,
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000 it's kind of hard to surprise.
01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:26.000 Did you do it to guy ironically?
01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:30.000 The easiest time to surprise a Jiu-Jitsu guy is on the map.
01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:33.000 If you're another Jiu-Jitsu guy, what you do is you play like,
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000 oh, we're just going like, right now.
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.000 And then you go hard.
01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.000 You know, so you can't really surprise them in public.
01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.000 You got to learn Jitsu, go on the map.
01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000 You know, they'll make them think you're not rolling out.
01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000 Then surprise.
01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:49.000 And you know, I think that's part of it is you become more aware.
01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000 When you're talking, you've been talking about the past couple minutes,
01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.000 is awareness.
01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:56.000 And when you have Jiu-Jitsu in your brain,
01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.000 then it's true with boxing too, and Moetai,
01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000 when you have that stuff in your brain,
01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:05.000 then you can't help but be aware of what's happening.
01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000 And because it's in there.
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.000 And it's like knowing that the color of the table is brown.
01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000 Like you know what that person's body position is.
01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:16.000 You're looking and seeing that their stance is off balance.
01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000 You're seeing an underhook exposed.
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000 You know, so you can't help.
01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.000 You can't take it away.
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.000 So you're awareness increases.
01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:24.000 You also are aware of what problems can occur really quickly.
01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.000 So if you start, you know, if you're a girl,
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:32.000 and you say, oh, wait a second, now I'm back into a corner where I can't get out.
01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.000 I don't like this feeling.
01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:37.000 It becomes it increases your awareness as a human.
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000 It makes you more aware of your surroundings.
01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000 So there's so many benefits.
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:41.000 Yeah.
01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000 It's kind of ridiculous.
01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.000 Yeah, and it kind of, you kind of have almost like one level up from that.
01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000 Or awareness that you're talking about because like how you're saying,
01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000 it's part of that, even if you don't know how to fight,
01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:52.000 it's still kind of on your mind.
01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.000 You know, you like all guys have that kind of sort of sort of evaluate,
01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:58.000 especially if the guys close to your close to you.
01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000 Yeah.
01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.000 Who you are.
01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:01.000 You know, whatever the stage,
01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.000 or whatever the scenario even, like if you're a scholar,
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000 and no one else is scholar, then another scholar walks in,
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:07.000 woo, this evaluation.
01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.000 So that's how it is naturally smart this guy.
01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000 Yeah.
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.000 So, oh, so as a guy just naturally,
01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:15.000 you're going to have even more.
01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000 It's like, you know what the color brown is or whatever,
01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:21.000 but just instinctually, you're always looking for brown.
01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.000 That's kind of what it's like.
01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.000 So now you, when you're doing these evaluations that are going to happen anyway,
01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.000 your jujitsu mind is right there at the front.
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:31.000 Ready?
01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.000 The whole time.
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.000 Yeah.
01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:34.000 Indeed, just thing.
01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.000 Dray magic to people.
01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.000 But that's not to be confused with like your aggressive and want to fight.
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.000 That's the weird thing.
01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:43.000 It's like you don't want to actually fight with people because you don't feel the need to like,
01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000 oh, I got a, I don't know,
01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.000 Yeah, you didn't think of it.
01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000 Yeah, that's where the soul conversation started off.
01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000 And also, I do not feel like you need to prove anything,
01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000 but I literally am like, oh,
01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:53.000 I really want to get a fight with this guy.
01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000 I'm like, my knuckles, you know,
01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:56.000 I'm probably going to rip my t-shirt,
01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:57.000 this guy's gonna be right there.
01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.000 This is really no.
01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.000 I fight every single day.
01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000 I don't need,
01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000 I don't care about this guy.
01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:09.000 This is a two second thing where I got to scuff up my knee on the pavement.
01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.000 And he's probably going to rip my shirt.
01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.000 And that's going to be a pain.
01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000 And I got to deal with the cops if they show up.
01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.000 It's just a big pain.
01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.000 Where as if you don't fight and you have that opportunity,
01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:20.000 maybe you got the thing inside you.
01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:21.000 You don't know.
01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:22.000 Right.
01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.000 The payoff of the fight, right?
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000 If you don't know or if you're just insecure,
01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.000 the payoff of the fight and hopefully winning is bigger than all the
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000 detriments that you got to do.
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000 I obviously tell my puttin guys,
01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:35.000 will we ever see before the war started?
01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.000 Hey, you know, so guys,
01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.000 or overseas, what are you doing?
01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:38.000 You're drinking your out and bars,
01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000 or causing problems or whatever.
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000 And I've, you know, before you do that,
01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:42.000 I'll be like, hey guys,
01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.000 if you feel like fighting tonight,
01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.000 come find me.
01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:47.000 Because if you want to fight, come find me and it'll be all be good.
01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000 You know, you know, we'll fight.
01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000 And it's all good.
01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.000 You won't get trouble.
01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000 You won't get arrested.
01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:52.000 You won't get hurt.
01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.000 It's all good.
01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.000 You'll get a show.
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.000 You're not going to get trouble for sure.
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:56.000 You're not going to get trouble with the law,
01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.000 though you know what I mean?
01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000 You're not going to get that kind of trouble.
01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000 You're going to get trouble in your situation
01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:01.000 and you're in your positioning.
01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000 It's going to be a trouble soon.
01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.000 So yeah, it's better to fight amongst yourself than to fight against
01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:09.000 the outsiders who are going to sue you,
01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:12.000 pull a knife out and stab you into throw whatever,
01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.000 right?
01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:14.000 You don't do that.
01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000 Stay out of the street fights.
01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000 Not worth it.
01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:18.000 You know,
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:19.000 all right.
01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:20.000 I agree with it too though.
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:23.000 I'm going to send you agree that it is the stabilizer.
01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:26.000 You don't even know how much you don't know.
01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.000 It's funny because we get a lot of people that have started training
01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000 to get to.
01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:32.000 Good move.
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000 Yes.
01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.000 But they'll come on Twitter or on on the Facebook.
01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000 And say,
01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000 you know,
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000 A is started training to get to.
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000 Oh my god.
01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.000 I can't believe I need to train this all the time.
01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000 I can't believe I got control.
01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000 They always say how humiliating.
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000 And sometimes they say humbling.
01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000 But sometimes I think even when they say humbling,
01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000 they actually mean humiliating because they,
01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000 you, that's the weird thing.
01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.000 When you're walking around on the earth without the knowledge,
01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000 you think you look at other people.
01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:03.000 You think you know what?
01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:04.000 This guy knows,
01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:05.000 Do you get to?
01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:06.000 I heard this guy knows,
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000 you do it doesn't matter.
01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:08.000 I'm strong.
01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:09.000 I'm athletic.
01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000 I'll just hit him in the neck or even even even.
01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000 You know what?
01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.000 I'm just strong enough.
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000 He's not going to get my house.
01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:15.000 You're going to get my arm over there.
01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.000 Yeah.
01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:17.000 It's not going to work.
01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:18.000 I'll just pull my arm back.
01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000 And you get on the mat.
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:19.000 You go,
01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:20.000 Oh my lord.
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000 I have no control over this situation.
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:27.000 This guy is effortlessly making me submit over and over and over again.
01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000 That's when the reality hits.
01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000 The reality hits doesn't end on the first time you tap.
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:32.000 Because on the first time you tap you go,
01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000 Oh, I'm, I'm going to,
01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.000 I'll just,
01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000 I won't do that single movement again.
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000 I won't stick my head over there.
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:38.000 Okay.
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.000 So then you get your arm locked.
01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000 Yeah.
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.000 And then you get your foot locked.
01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:42.000 And then you get your knee locked.
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:42.000 And then you get your knee locked.
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.000 And then you get your knee.
01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:43.000 And then you get your knee.
01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:44.000 G-atine again.
01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:44.000 Then you get your,
01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.000 So you,
01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000 It's just a lose lose lose lose lose lose lose lose.
01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000 And then you go after,
01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:50.000 Usually it for me.
01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:55.000 It's like three to five times with somebody that's never trained to get to before three to five times before they realize like,
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000 Oh, I'm never,
01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000 Because you know,
01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000 When you tap a guy once that's never trained before.
01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000 And he comes at you so hard again.
01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000 He's mind.
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:02.000 He thinks,
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:03.000 And this time I'm going to get him.
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000 Yeah.
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000 And then we even come close.
01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:06.000 They don't even realize.
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.000 Yeah.
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:07.000 So yeah,
01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.000 Get on the mat man and learn learn the jjitsu.
01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:11.000 Yeah.
01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000 Please cover the over,
01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:18.000 or please cover overcoming the frustrations of beginning to jjitsu.
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:21.000 And this is coming from a 54 year old, by the way,
01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:22.000 But not quitting.
01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000 Good, good for him.
01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:25.000 That's awesome.
01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:28.000 Glad you're picking up the jjitsu a 54 years old.
01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000 Okay.
01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000 So how do you, the frustrations of beginning jjitsu?
01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000 And it is absolutely.
01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000 If you have the wrong mindset,
01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:36.000 It's viciously frustrating.
01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000 Because of everything we just talked about.
01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.000 And you think,
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.000 Oh, I'll just do this.
01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000 It's cold a bit harder.
01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.000 And I just won't put my arm there.
01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000 And then I'll be able to win.
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000 You're not going to win.
01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:44.000 You are going to lose.
01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:47.000 You're going to lose over and over and over again.
01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000 To people that are smaller than you.
01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.000 Weakier than you.
01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000 Not as tough as you are.
01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000 Literally not as tough as you are.
01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.000 Yeah.
01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000 Not as tough as you are.
01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:59.000 You know, jjitsu has a faction of, of,
01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000 Gnords for lack of a better word.
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000 Straight nerds.
01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000 And no offense to the nerds out there.
01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:06.000 But, you know,
01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000 people that are not physically active.
01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:12.000 And then some for some reason they fall into jjitsu at some point.
01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000 And they, and they also,
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000 They've got a guy that's not tough.
01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.000 But they'll know the moves and I'll finish you.
01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000 So that's so those the people you're going to lose to.
01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:28.000 So and it's a, it's a long, long, slow journey that takes a long time.
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:31.000 Now that being said,
01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:35.000 If you train for a month and someone's train zero,
01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.000 that journey is not that long.
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.000 You'll be that guy.
01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000 Yeah.
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.000 You will beat that guy.
01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.000 I mean, you know, again,
01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:41.000 you take two people.
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.000 One of them knows jjitsu for a month.
01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:45.000 And one of them doesn't.
01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:46.000 That guy's going to win.
01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000 I mean, you know,
01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:49.000 it's basically the same way,
01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:50.000 it's the same, you know,
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000 you can't have so many that's completely weak.
01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000 But in six months,
01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000 you're beating anybody that's untrained for the,
01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.000 you're beating 95% that maybe you're 99% that people are untrained.
02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000 But as far as,
02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.000 like,
02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.000 you think you show up and in six months,
02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000 you're going to be beating a blue belt.
02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000 It's not happening.
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:10.000 Yeah.
02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.000 Yeah.
02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.000 It's not happening.
02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000 A beating a purple belt is not happening.
02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:17.000 You're not going to catch a purple belt in,
02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:20.000 in your first two or three years.
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000 Unless you got to somebody that doesn't.
02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000 Or he lets you.
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000 Yeah.
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:25.000 Of course.
02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:26.000 Yeah.
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:26.000 In like,
02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000 Glover,
02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000 he'll, he'll let people put him in all kind of,
02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000 I mean, he does that in companies.
02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.000 He just saw that I've met him more.
02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:32.000 So he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:32.000 he's,
02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000 he's,
02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:35.000 that's all kinds of crazy things happen.
02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:35.000 So yeah,
02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000 can that happen of course,
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000 but as far as legitimately,
02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.000 taking someone down.
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:40.000 Yeah.
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000 It's not going to happen.
02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:43.000 So, so that's all that's what I'm saying,
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:44.000 as long as,
02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:45.000 slowly,
02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:46.000 slowly.
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.000 Especially two because,
02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000 everyone's on that bus.
02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:50.000 We've talked about this before.
02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:51.000 Everyone's on the bus getting better.
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:54.000 So that blue belt that started that you started six months behind,
02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.000 or a year behind.
02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000 So he's a blue belt.
02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.000 You're a year behind him.
02:00:58.000 --> 02:00:59.000 He's not stopping getting better.
02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000 So, as you start to pursue
02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:01.000 his game.
02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:04.84 changing and improving so you're not going to get there.
02:01:04.84 --> 02:01:09.08 And then on top of that, when you do learn something new,
02:01:09.08 --> 02:01:11.08 it takes time to incorporate into your game.
02:01:11.08 --> 02:01:14.08 So if I taught you echo a new move tonight,
02:01:14.08 --> 02:01:15.28 as it hit here's this cool,
02:01:15.28 --> 02:01:18.28 it's here's this new setup for the Armlock
02:01:18.28 --> 02:01:20.24 and we drilled it 10 times.
02:01:20.24 --> 02:01:22.64 And you went now and started to apply that,
02:01:22.64 --> 02:01:25.08 it would make your game worse.
02:01:25.08 --> 02:01:26.96 Because you'd be trying to apply a move
02:01:26.96 --> 02:01:28.88 that you don't know 100% yet.
02:01:28.88 --> 02:01:30.68 Like you got some good solid moves
02:01:30.68 --> 02:01:32.76 that you do and those are, you know,
02:01:32.76 --> 02:01:34.40 those work really well.
02:01:34.40 --> 02:01:36.72 So when you start incorporating this new move,
02:01:36.72 --> 02:01:38.20 you don't know it well.
02:01:38.20 --> 02:01:40.08 You don't get it all together.
02:01:40.08 --> 02:01:42.64 So you're gonna fail out at 100 times.
02:01:42.64 --> 02:01:44.84 It's not gonna work 100 times before you get it.
02:01:44.84 --> 02:01:46.36 And by the way, every time you try to do it on me,
02:01:46.36 --> 02:01:47.88 I got on top and then I smashed you.
02:01:47.88 --> 02:01:49.80 And then I, so you're, you're sacrificing
02:01:49.80 --> 02:01:50.96 and it's in every time.
02:01:50.96 --> 02:01:52.84 So you're actually going backwards a little bit
02:01:52.84 --> 02:01:54.36 before you can go forward.
02:01:54.36 --> 02:01:57.52 So that's problematic and that's very, very frustrating.
02:01:57.52 --> 02:01:59.80 Occasionally you might learn something that,
02:01:59.80 --> 02:02:01.64 like, really improves your game dramatically,
02:02:01.64 --> 02:02:03.60 almost instantly that happens from time to time.
02:02:03.60 --> 02:02:05.52 So we'll say, hey, put your own position here
02:02:05.52 --> 02:02:08.000 or hey, you know, whatever the case may be.
02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:09.80 But generally when you incorporate something new,
02:02:09.80 --> 02:02:10.80 it can take some time.
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:13.64 You're gonna get injuries.
02:02:13.64 --> 02:02:14.64 You're gonna get little injuries.
02:02:14.64 --> 02:02:15.64 You're gonna get big injuries.
02:02:15.64 --> 02:02:16.64 You're gonna be sore.
02:02:16.64 --> 02:02:18.60 You're gonna, so yes, you will be frustrated.
02:02:18.60 --> 02:02:20.16 So how do you counter all that?
02:02:20.16 --> 02:02:21.44 You just gotta embrace it.
02:02:21.44 --> 02:02:23.60 You gotta embrace all those things.
02:02:23.60 --> 02:02:25.84 You gotta enjoy all those things.
02:02:26.92 --> 02:02:27.92 And I hate to be cliche,
02:02:27.92 --> 02:02:29.60 but you gotta enjoy the journey.
02:02:29.60 --> 02:02:32.68 You gotta enjoy getting tapped out by somebody
02:02:32.68 --> 02:02:35.08 that's a, be amazed by that.
02:02:35.08 --> 02:02:37.36 Say, dang, how did that just happen?
02:02:37.36 --> 02:02:38.44 That is impressive.
02:02:38.44 --> 02:02:41.84 You know, say, hey, got a little war scar on my face.
02:02:41.84 --> 02:02:43.44 I got split the eye open.
02:02:43.44 --> 02:02:44.28 Okay, cool.
02:02:44.28 --> 02:02:45.28 Chick's takes scars.
02:02:45.28 --> 02:02:46.12 You know what I mean?
02:02:46.12 --> 02:02:50.32 Just gonna go, don't, don't, don't look at all that stuff
02:02:50.32 --> 02:02:51.16 as negative.
02:02:51.16 --> 02:02:52.72 Look at it as, you know what I'm saying?
02:02:52.72 --> 02:02:54.96 Don't rush to the end.
02:02:54.96 --> 02:02:55.92 Don't rush to the end.
02:02:55.92 --> 02:02:57.28 Don't be in rush to get there.
02:02:57.28 --> 02:02:59.56 Take your time and enjoy the sights
02:02:59.56 --> 02:03:01.04 that you're gonna go for.
02:03:01.04 --> 02:03:03.12 Also, I've said this before.
02:03:04.12 --> 02:03:05.68 Select your training partners carefully,
02:03:05.68 --> 02:03:07.36 especially like your 54 years old.
02:03:07.36 --> 02:03:09.32 You don't wanna be wrong with the 20 year old
02:03:09.32 --> 02:03:10.40 to stay right freak.
02:03:10.40 --> 02:03:12.64 That's going white belt trying to kill you.
02:03:12.64 --> 02:03:15.68 You wanna be wrong with a cool, mellow,
02:03:15.68 --> 02:03:20.68 purple belt that's wants to do GJ2 and train.
02:03:20.68 --> 02:03:25.28 And finally, I would just say, remember that GJ2
02:03:25.28 --> 02:03:26.92 should be fun.
02:03:26.92 --> 02:03:28.20 It should be all those other things,
02:03:28.20 --> 02:03:29.60 all those frustrated, all those challenges,
02:03:29.60 --> 02:03:31.80 all those things, all that humiliation and humor
02:03:31.80 --> 02:03:34.20 and getting humbled, but it should be a good time.
02:03:34.20 --> 02:03:35.84 You should have fun when you're doing GJ2.
02:03:35.84 --> 02:03:36.68 I know I do.
02:03:36.68 --> 02:03:38.84 Yeah, yeah, like a video game, right?
02:03:38.84 --> 02:03:41.76 I mean, you can get down for a couple of days, man.
02:03:41.76 --> 02:03:43.20 And I came back and had an injury
02:03:43.20 --> 02:03:44.92 that I figured out, took me a little while,
02:03:44.92 --> 02:03:46.16 I got my jacked up finger.
02:03:46.16 --> 02:03:49.56 It took me a little while to get the right,
02:03:49.56 --> 02:03:53.92 get the right apparatus to splint it properly and protect it,
02:03:53.92 --> 02:03:58.08 but tonight I train and I was so happy.
02:03:58.08 --> 02:04:02.08 I was so happy going in on the mat just saying yes.
02:04:02.08 --> 02:04:05.52 Yeah, that is how we're all these,
02:04:05.52 --> 02:04:08.56 all the junk parts that come with it were,
02:04:08.56 --> 02:04:11.08 cool, don't cool, junk, you know, like the four-ness,
02:04:11.08 --> 02:04:13.04 yeah, I got choked out of where,
02:04:13.04 --> 02:04:15.68 that's all part of the game, seems obvious, right?
02:04:15.68 --> 02:04:16.80 Yeah, it's all part of the game,
02:04:16.80 --> 02:04:19.24 but be happy that that's the game you're in.
02:04:19.24 --> 02:04:20.84 I mean, GJ2, basic, I mean, if you don't,
02:04:20.84 --> 02:04:24.56 do GJ2, this would be kind of an insight.
02:04:24.56 --> 02:04:27.28 Basically, all it is, if you go to a class,
02:04:27.28 --> 02:04:29.72 you go in, you may or may not warm up,
02:04:29.72 --> 02:04:32.80 you learn a move, whether it be a submission move,
02:04:32.80 --> 02:04:34.60 just a move, you learn a move, two moves,
02:04:34.60 --> 02:04:36.52 three moves, somethings, four moves,
02:04:36.52 --> 02:04:38.64 and then you cut to roll in.
02:04:38.64 --> 02:04:40.64 Straight up, you guys are fighting, no strikes,
02:04:40.64 --> 02:04:42.56 that's it, you're fighting, no strikes.
02:04:42.56 --> 02:04:44.12 If you, whatever moves you know,
02:04:44.12 --> 02:04:46.48 go ahead and do them while in real life,
02:04:46.48 --> 02:04:47.96 against this guy, that's it.
02:04:47.96 --> 02:04:50.32 If you don't know it, if that's your first day,
02:04:50.32 --> 02:04:53.24 and you learn one, two, three moves that first day,
02:04:53.24 --> 02:04:54.64 you better try to do those moves.
02:04:54.64 --> 02:04:55.48 That's it.
02:04:55.48 --> 02:04:56.96 So of course, you know, two, three moves
02:04:56.96 --> 02:04:58.96 that you learned once, by the way,
02:04:58.96 --> 02:05:00.16 and you're roll with someone who,
02:05:00.16 --> 02:05:02.04 even if he's still a wipe out to whatever,
02:05:02.04 --> 02:05:04.20 he knows those moves and then three, four more,
02:05:04.20 --> 02:05:06.88 and he's practiced some in real time or whatever.
02:05:06.88 --> 02:05:08.32 Of course, he's gonna get you.
02:05:08.32 --> 02:05:09.60 That's just how it works.
02:05:09.60 --> 02:05:11.12 But keep in mind, the more you go,
02:05:11.12 --> 02:05:12.84 the more you do the moves, the more moves you learn,
02:05:12.84 --> 02:05:14.40 the more you practice some in real life,
02:05:14.40 --> 02:05:15.92 the better you get at him.
02:05:15.92 --> 02:05:18.88 And you know, let's go ahead and just apply this to life as well.
02:05:18.88 --> 02:05:20.88 Because GJ2 is such a great metaphor for life.
02:05:22.20 --> 02:05:25.68 Whatever you're doing, whatever goal you're trying to achieve.
02:05:25.68 --> 02:05:27.60 If you're letting those frustrations,
02:05:27.60 --> 02:05:28.44 when you hit those obstacles,
02:05:28.44 --> 02:05:31.12 if you're letting them control you and get you down,
02:05:31.12 --> 02:05:33.000 that's the wrong attitude to have.
02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.56 Look at it as a learning opportunity.
02:05:34.56 --> 02:05:36.44 Look at it as something that's good to tapping,
02:05:36.44 --> 02:05:39.68 look at it as a chance for you to try something new,
02:05:39.68 --> 02:05:42.60 look at it as the journey that you're trying to,
02:05:42.60 --> 02:05:45.80 and by the way, anything that's easy to achieve,
02:05:45.80 --> 02:05:46.92 and you don't hit me obstacles,
02:05:46.92 --> 02:05:48.32 well, that's not worth it, right?
02:05:48.32 --> 02:05:51.04 That's not gonna get the full satisfaction
02:05:51.04 --> 02:05:52.40 that you want out of that.
02:05:52.40 --> 02:05:56.44 So in life as in GJ2,
02:05:56.44 --> 02:05:59.72 don't get frustrated, embrace those challenges
02:05:59.72 --> 02:06:03.72 because those are what is making this goal worthwhile.
02:06:03.72 --> 02:06:06.24 Yeah, man, I'm telling you when you,
02:06:06.24 --> 02:06:10.000 let's say you, we'll back to the avoiding frustrations,
02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:13.24 specifically, it does how you're saying training partners,
02:06:13.24 --> 02:06:14.52 that does make a big difference.
02:06:14.52 --> 02:06:15.76 Because sometimes, every once in a while,
02:06:15.76 --> 02:06:19.80 I've heard of people where their schedule doesn't allow them
02:06:19.80 --> 02:06:22.28 to catch the big in a class for example.
02:06:22.28 --> 02:06:23.32 So they're like, hey, I've no choice,
02:06:23.32 --> 02:06:25.60 I gotta do this more intermediate or advanced class.
02:06:25.60 --> 02:06:29.16 So they're the only white belt and the next guy
02:06:29.16 --> 02:06:31.72 even closest to him is like, advanced blue belt.
02:06:31.72 --> 02:06:35.44 So that's gonna be a steep learning curve,
02:06:35.44 --> 02:06:36.32 it's gonna be tough,
02:06:36.32 --> 02:06:38.36 because how are you gonna practice your moves
02:06:38.36 --> 02:06:39.20 in the wild?
02:06:39.20 --> 02:06:40.56 You won't get to work your offense.
02:06:40.56 --> 02:06:41.40 Yeah, that's really fun.
02:06:41.40 --> 02:06:44.20 Here's kind of the good thing, you get to work your defense.
02:06:44.20 --> 02:06:46.64 So once you do get the opportunity to exercise
02:06:46.64 --> 02:06:48.60 like your offense, whether you get another class
02:06:48.60 --> 02:06:50.60 or it just comes, but just takes longer, whatever,
02:06:50.60 --> 02:06:52.32 but how good your defense is gonna be?
02:06:52.32 --> 02:06:54.84 Yeah, and I actually, so from training with Dean
02:06:54.84 --> 02:06:56.000 for so many years,
02:06:57.16 --> 02:07:00.08 he's just got some positions that are brutal,
02:07:00.08 --> 02:07:01.36 brutal positions.
02:07:01.36 --> 02:07:04.40 And, for instance, his mount is outstanding.
02:07:04.40 --> 02:07:05.96 When he gets the mount,
02:07:05.96 --> 02:07:09.68 when anybody else that I've ever trained within my life
02:07:09.68 --> 02:07:13.16 has mounted with the exception, I guess, of Hicks and Gracie,
02:07:13.16 --> 02:07:15.76 I felt like, oh, it's not Dean, this is not,
02:07:15.76 --> 02:07:17.56 you know, this is not the whole of this area.
02:07:17.56 --> 02:07:18.96 Right, and not that I'm not that worried,
02:07:18.96 --> 02:07:21.52 I'm not trying to degrade people I've trained with,
02:07:21.52 --> 02:07:23.92 but that is a green has an incredible mount.
02:07:23.92 --> 02:07:27.16 And on top of that, Dean kind of knows my escapes.
02:07:27.16 --> 02:07:29.96 So whereas if I roll with a random other really good,
02:07:29.96 --> 02:07:32.16 you know, world of class, black belt,
02:07:32.16 --> 02:07:34.000 they might not know the particulars of my escape,
02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:35.80 Dean actually does know those,
02:07:35.80 --> 02:07:37.60 and he's good at it.
02:07:37.60 --> 02:07:40.12 So, so you're right in that,
02:07:40.12 --> 02:07:42.04 the more you train with people that are better than you,
02:07:42.04 --> 02:07:44.44 your defense is gonna be very good,
02:07:44.44 --> 02:07:46.80 because like when you mount me,
02:07:46.80 --> 02:07:48.04 I mean, you got a good solid mount,
02:07:48.04 --> 02:07:50.56 but I'm like, I'm like, okay, cool,
02:07:50.56 --> 02:07:51.60 I'm gonna be out of this and I'll,
02:07:51.60 --> 02:07:54.24 in a short period of time with no real threats.
02:07:54.24 --> 02:07:55.08 Keep telling me.
02:07:55.08 --> 02:07:58.12 And, and the, you've had, I mean,
02:07:58.12 --> 02:07:59.08 I'm sure it's the same way,
02:07:59.08 --> 02:08:00.36 if you've had Dean mounted on you,
02:08:00.36 --> 02:08:02.48 I mean, my mount, because I don't have a great mount,
02:08:02.48 --> 02:08:06.12 my mount is nothing compared to Dean's, nothing.
02:08:06.12 --> 02:08:09.28 Yeah, yeah, fully, yeah, and that's absolutely true.
02:08:09.28 --> 02:08:13.80 And at the same time though, so if you fall in,
02:08:13.80 --> 02:08:15.76 and I don't wanna say it's like a small,
02:08:15.76 --> 02:08:18.28 because it's pretty big chance where if you enter a beginner class,
02:08:18.28 --> 02:08:21.52 there's gonna be a guy who's just as much of a beginner as you,
02:08:21.52 --> 02:08:23.92 and that's where you can really flourish,
02:08:23.92 --> 02:08:28.000 because you can practice moves, your new moves,
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.40 which I mean, for lack of a better term,
02:08:29.40 --> 02:08:30.68 your junk moves, you know,
02:08:30.68 --> 02:08:31.84 on junk people.
02:08:31.84 --> 02:08:33.68 I will say this though.
02:08:33.68 --> 02:08:36.60 Whoever you roll with, whether they're worse than you,
02:08:36.60 --> 02:08:37.84 the same as you are better than you,
02:08:37.84 --> 02:08:38.96 you're gonna get a lot out of it.
02:08:38.96 --> 02:08:40.000 Of course, all three of them.
02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.28 So you should roll with all three of those types of people.
02:08:42.28 --> 02:08:46.08 I have a tendency to wanna usually roll with guys
02:08:46.08 --> 02:08:49.24 that are, you know, like good,
02:08:49.24 --> 02:08:52.24 and I should spend more, and I do,
02:08:52.24 --> 02:08:53.76 I mean, I definitely, I train with everybody
02:08:53.76 --> 02:08:55.52 that we got at the gym, all training everybody.
02:08:55.52 --> 02:08:58.40 But I always prefer, of course.
02:08:58.40 --> 02:08:59.40 I guess I shouldn't say, of course,
02:08:59.40 --> 02:09:01.20 because there are people that are like white,
02:09:01.20 --> 02:09:02.20 belt hunters.
02:09:02.20 --> 02:09:05.72 Yeah, I wanna go out there and be bullies.
02:09:05.72 --> 02:09:07.84 I'm not like that, I'd rather get bullied, right?
02:09:07.84 --> 02:09:10.08 I wanna get, I wanna feel the,
02:09:10.08 --> 02:09:11.56 I wanna get after it, you know?
02:09:11.56 --> 02:09:12.72 Yeah.
02:09:12.72 --> 02:09:15.48 But you definitely get benefit from training
02:09:15.48 --> 02:09:16.96 with people that are better than you,
02:09:16.96 --> 02:09:18.64 worse than you, and the same as you.
02:09:18.64 --> 02:09:20.76 Because you practice one of them,
02:09:20.76 --> 02:09:21.88 you're practicing defense,
02:09:21.88 --> 02:09:23.40 one of them, you're practicing pure offense,
02:09:23.40 --> 02:09:24.60 and someone that's equal than you,
02:09:24.60 --> 02:09:26.04 you guys are practicing your setups,
02:09:26.04 --> 02:09:29.40 and your approaches, and you gotta learn how to defend,
02:09:29.40 --> 02:09:31.44 and do offense and defense at the same time.
02:09:31.44 --> 02:09:34.04 So it's all good, bro.
02:09:34.04 --> 02:09:35.74 That's basically the concept here,
02:09:35.74 --> 02:09:38.72 bro. Yes, get after it, consider that scenario,
02:09:38.72 --> 02:09:40.92 bro with, and you're talking from an ideal standpoint,
02:09:40.92 --> 02:09:42.26 bro, with people better than you, same as you,
02:09:42.26 --> 02:09:45.22 worse than you, or you know, not as good as you.
02:09:45.22 --> 02:09:47.12 For a beginner, that's not really the option.
02:09:47.12 --> 02:09:49.02 The worst thing you guys, that's not an option
02:09:49.02 --> 02:09:51.20 for a beginner, really, and also,
02:09:51.20 --> 02:09:52.32 there's no one to support them.
02:09:52.32 --> 02:09:55.66 Well, as far as overcoming the frustrations or whatever,
02:09:55.66 --> 02:09:58.000 it is a good situation where you can get in
02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.04 with guys, just as beginner as you.
02:10:00.04 --> 02:10:03.72 And I hope that they hang around this after a certain
02:10:03.72 --> 02:10:05.40 amount of time, those guys who aren't,
02:10:05.40 --> 02:10:08.48 as new or, or, I could, I could see where it could
02:10:08.48 --> 02:10:09.68 become frustrating.
02:10:09.68 --> 02:10:11.32 If you were the guy that you're someone
02:10:11.32 --> 02:10:13.48 earlier, let's say a guy that's, you have to work late,
02:10:13.48 --> 02:10:15.36 and you can only go to the advanced class.
02:10:15.36 --> 02:10:16.60 And all of the sudden, you think you're
02:10:16.60 --> 02:10:18.12 just just getting crushed.
02:10:18.12 --> 02:10:20.08 Yes, and I can't learn this, really.
02:10:20.08 --> 02:10:21.22 Yeah, you know, it's like I'm getting
02:10:21.22 --> 02:10:24.32 distanced to understand, but yeah, that's, that's a good point.
02:10:24.32 --> 02:10:27.000 So keep in mind that if you're in that situation,
02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.08 it's okay, you're gonna, you're gonna,
02:10:29.08 --> 02:10:31.000 when you eventually get to roll with people
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.20 that are more your skill level,
02:10:33.20 --> 02:10:36.52 you will be, you'll be that much better off.
02:10:36.52 --> 02:10:38.76 Yeah, yeah, for sure.
02:10:38.76 --> 02:10:40.76 And, and watch the first time you tap someone out
02:10:40.76 --> 02:10:42.000 with a move that you learned.
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:42.84 Oh.
02:10:42.84 --> 02:10:44.16 Oh.
02:10:44.16 --> 02:10:46.84 Celebrate that, did you?
02:10:46.84 --> 02:10:48.72 Yeah, that's a good, it's a good time.
02:10:48.72 --> 02:10:50.96 It's a terrible one.
02:10:50.96 --> 02:10:52.96 Next question.
02:10:52.96 --> 02:10:56.12 Jockel, how do you balance the idea of checking the
02:10:56.12 --> 02:10:59.04 ego while in an interview scenario where you need to
02:10:59.04 --> 02:11:00.88 talk about yourself?
02:11:00.88 --> 02:11:03.28 Okay, so good question.
02:11:03.28 --> 02:11:06.16 I would say in that situation,
02:11:06.16 --> 02:11:08.88 then that's something that it's not just an interview
02:11:08.88 --> 02:11:10.88 situation where you're gonna need to do that.
02:11:10.88 --> 02:11:12.56 I mean, you're dealing with your, your,
02:11:13.76 --> 02:11:17.24 superiors, you know, throughout the course of your career,
02:11:17.24 --> 02:11:19.60 whatever that may be, you're constantly interacting
02:11:19.60 --> 02:11:23.44 with people and you're gonna want to make an impression.
02:11:23.44 --> 02:11:26.56 So I think one of the best ways to do this is
02:11:26.56 --> 02:11:31.56 instead of you speaking about why you're so awesome,
02:11:32.16 --> 02:11:36.16 just state facts of, let's say accomplishments
02:11:36.16 --> 02:11:38.96 and let them speak for themselves.
02:11:40.92 --> 02:11:44.56 In other words, you know, you wouldn't wanna say,
02:11:46.12 --> 02:11:49.12 I am the best project manager in the entire world.
02:11:49.12 --> 02:11:50.28 Mm-hmm.
02:11:50.28 --> 02:11:55.28 Right, that's not, that sounds ego centric.
02:11:55.28 --> 02:11:58.48 You know, instead you'd say, you know,
02:11:58.48 --> 02:12:01.08 I got this, we had a $38 million project,
02:12:01.08 --> 02:12:03.44 got it done on time, under budget,
02:12:03.44 --> 02:12:05.80 ahead of schedule and when I got done with that,
02:12:05.80 --> 02:12:07.96 when they moved me to another project that was off track,
02:12:07.96 --> 02:12:11.76 and we got that one back on schedule and back on track as well.
02:12:11.76 --> 02:12:14.12 So that's the kind of experience that I've had
02:12:14.12 --> 02:12:16.12 and I love to bring that here to this company.
02:12:16.12 --> 02:12:17.92 Right, so you're not, you're not,
02:12:19.36 --> 02:12:22.20 you know, there's a hint of, hey, this is what I did.
02:12:22.20 --> 02:12:24.80 I can get some stuff done, but you're not saying, listen,
02:12:24.80 --> 02:12:26.92 I'm better than the people you currently have,
02:12:26.92 --> 02:12:28.36 so you should hire me because I'm the best,
02:12:28.36 --> 02:12:29.80 because you don't wanna be that.
02:12:31.24 --> 02:12:35.60 And you know, so yeah, just build, think about it
02:12:35.60 --> 02:12:38.72 you know, before you go in, what, what experience
02:12:38.72 --> 02:12:42.32 that you have represents the good qualities that you have.
02:12:42.32 --> 02:12:44.88 So then you can say, if they say, you know,
02:12:44.88 --> 02:12:46.72 how are you at meeting timelines?
02:12:46.72 --> 02:12:48.92 You don't say, I am perfect and I never late.
02:12:48.92 --> 02:12:49.72 I'm dope.
02:12:49.72 --> 02:12:52.72 You just say, you say, well, you know,
02:12:52.72 --> 02:12:55.84 as far as meeting timelines, here's a bunch of projects
02:12:55.84 --> 02:12:58.24 that I got completed on time, the only one that I missed
02:12:58.24 --> 02:13:00.16 was one that we had to roll back as whatever,
02:13:00.16 --> 02:13:02.000 that we are actually showing a little bit more humility.
02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.16 You're saying, hey, here's what happened.
02:13:03.16 --> 02:13:04.44 You're being logical about it.
02:13:04.44 --> 02:13:05.64 And you know, speaking of that,
02:13:05.64 --> 02:13:08.48 I actually got a good question that's similar to this one
02:13:09.64 --> 02:13:13.72 about what's the best way to interview people
02:13:13.72 --> 02:13:17.08 to see if they can be in a leadership position.
02:13:17.08 --> 02:13:19.16 And this is really hard, this is really hard,
02:13:19.16 --> 02:13:21.52 because it's really hard to interview,
02:13:21.52 --> 02:13:23.48 and working at work with all kinds of different companies.
02:13:23.48 --> 02:13:25.08 And everybody always says, you know, hey,
02:13:25.08 --> 02:13:26.20 what's the best way to interview?
02:13:26.20 --> 02:13:28.72 And man, I interviewed this guy and he seemed so great
02:13:28.72 --> 02:13:30.92 or I interviewed this woman and she seemed incredible
02:13:30.92 --> 02:13:33.08 and her paper looked great, you know,
02:13:33.08 --> 02:13:34.60 she looked great on paper and we hired her
02:13:34.60 --> 02:13:36.76 and she's a disaster or he's a disaster,
02:13:36.76 --> 02:13:38.04 whatever the case may be.
02:13:38.04 --> 02:13:41.08 Because there's people that are very good interviewer.
02:13:41.08 --> 02:13:43.24 She's right, I mean, there's people that can interview you well.
02:13:43.24 --> 02:13:46.24 They have the gift the gap, they can be us their way
02:13:46.24 --> 02:13:48.12 through anything and make themselves sound good.
02:13:48.12 --> 02:13:52.20 So it can be really hard to identify if someone's good
02:13:52.20 --> 02:13:55.48 is actually gonna be fit for a leadership,
02:13:55.48 --> 02:13:56.96 it's not really any position.
02:13:56.96 --> 02:13:59.72 So one of the things that I always tell people to do
02:13:59.72 --> 02:14:02.32 is when you go into these, when you wanna ask interview questions,
02:14:02.32 --> 02:14:05.04 ask them scenario-based questions.
02:14:05.04 --> 02:14:06.72 And say, okay, here's what's going on.
02:14:06.72 --> 02:14:09.76 You got these three people in your department
02:14:09.76 --> 02:14:14.24 and one of the people has come to you
02:14:14.24 --> 02:14:16.28 and said that they think there might be something
02:14:16.28 --> 02:14:18.96 illegal going on with the other two.
02:14:18.96 --> 02:14:20.48 What actions do you take?
02:14:20.48 --> 02:14:22.68 And you know, have a scenario built out
02:14:22.68 --> 02:14:24.28 that you can actually talk through
02:14:24.28 --> 02:14:26.40 and see where they go and see what their mind said is
02:14:26.40 --> 02:14:28.12 and see what they're gonna develop as a plan
02:14:28.12 --> 02:14:29.24 and see how they would actually plan.
02:14:29.24 --> 02:14:34.20 So it's a great way of figuring out how people think.
02:14:34.20 --> 02:14:37.40 And then, you know, even that's not a guarantee
02:14:37.40 --> 02:14:41.20 because there's people that can navigate those type of answers
02:14:41.20 --> 02:14:42.04 as well.
02:14:42.04 --> 02:14:43.60 So you know, one thing you can do is hire people
02:14:43.60 --> 02:14:45.000 on a little bit of a trial basis.
02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:46.52 And that can be difficult in some situations
02:14:46.52 --> 02:14:47.92 where people are walking away from one job
02:14:47.92 --> 02:14:49.12 and two other job and they're not gonna do it
02:14:49.12 --> 02:14:50.80 on a 90 day trial basis.
02:14:50.80 --> 02:14:51.92 But when you do have that opportunity,
02:14:51.92 --> 02:14:53.36 it's a good thing to do as well.
02:14:55.32 --> 02:14:57.92 But hey, so going back to the first question
02:14:57.92 --> 02:15:00.92 about keeping your ego in check and an interview,
02:15:00.92 --> 02:15:04.28 like I said, be confident but not cocky
02:15:04.28 --> 02:15:06.84 and let the facts of your experience
02:15:06.84 --> 02:15:11.84 speak for your abilities rather than be it in your own chest.
02:15:11.84 --> 02:15:13.76 Be it in your own chest.
02:15:13.76 --> 02:15:15.12 Yeah, so it's almost like,
02:15:15.12 --> 02:15:16.56 I mean, correct me from wrong here.
02:15:16.56 --> 02:15:21.24 So you essentially, even if you're talking yourself up,
02:15:21.24 --> 02:15:24.16 you just simply state the facts.
02:15:24.16 --> 02:15:25.000 That's it.
02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:25.84 You just state the facts.
02:15:25.84 --> 02:15:26.84 Don't say you're opinion about it.
02:15:26.84 --> 02:15:29.08 Like just like just simply state the facts.
02:15:29.08 --> 02:15:30.64 Yeah, here's what I did.
02:15:30.64 --> 02:15:32.96 You know, right, we turned this project around.
02:15:32.96 --> 02:15:34.80 We got it on track and on budget
02:15:34.80 --> 02:15:36.000 and that's the type of,
02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.40 that's the type of experience that I have
02:15:37.40 --> 02:15:38.40 in those situations.
02:15:38.40 --> 02:15:40.08 Right, just like how you're saying,
02:15:40.08 --> 02:15:42.28 like even if someone had got like an award
02:15:42.28 --> 02:15:45.44 to be the best whatever.
02:15:45.44 --> 02:15:46.44 Sales are in the year.
02:15:46.44 --> 02:15:47.48 That right, sales are in the year,
02:15:47.48 --> 02:15:49.28 the best whatever of the year.
02:15:49.28 --> 02:15:53.000 And then like to say that in a factual way would be,
02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:55.88 I was recognized as the best guy in the world.
02:15:55.88 --> 02:15:57.60 Instead of saying, I'm the best guy in the world.
02:15:57.60 --> 02:15:59.68 Here's my award to prove it.
02:15:59.68 --> 02:16:00.76 You know, so it's like you're seeing the fact
02:16:00.76 --> 02:16:02.000 that you were recognized.
02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:03.000 Yeah, yeah.
02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.12 Not so much the fact.
02:16:04.12 --> 02:16:06.84 That's a very good way of doing it.
02:16:06.84 --> 02:16:07.84 Stick to the facts, right?
02:16:07.84 --> 02:16:08.68 Just the facts.
02:16:08.68 --> 02:16:11.68 Yeah, sure next question.
02:16:11.68 --> 02:16:16.36 How do you stay humble when you know you have better
02:16:16.36 --> 02:16:18.92 skill sets than others?
02:16:18.92 --> 02:16:22.48 You seem humble with all that you've accomplished.
02:16:22.48 --> 02:16:24.68 Well, this is just what, like in general,
02:16:24.68 --> 02:16:27.88 just how do you stay humble when you know you have
02:16:27.88 --> 02:16:29.96 better skill sets than others?
02:16:29.96 --> 02:16:32.76 And then you say that I seem humble with all that
02:16:32.76 --> 02:16:35.000 I've accomplished, which is actually,
02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:38.60 it's funny when I read that.
02:16:38.60 --> 02:16:42.80 Like it's not, I'm sure that for the dude
02:16:42.80 --> 02:16:45.08 is asking this question, he's thinking I accomplished
02:16:45.08 --> 02:16:47.04 all this stuff and it's not, I don't feel that way.
02:16:47.04 --> 02:16:50.88 Like first of all, there's always somebody
02:16:50.88 --> 02:16:52.08 that's better than you.
02:16:52.08 --> 02:16:53.80 That's, that I guarantee it.
02:16:53.80 --> 02:16:55.56 There's someone that's done more than you.
02:16:55.56 --> 02:16:56.84 There's someone that's had better experience
02:16:56.84 --> 02:16:58.96 or someone that's accomplished more.
02:16:58.96 --> 02:17:03.96 And if you are truly the master of something,
02:17:06.36 --> 02:17:10.24 whatever one thing, you're a true master of.
02:17:10.24 --> 02:17:13.16 There's gonna be people that are a lot better
02:17:13.16 --> 02:17:14.48 at other things than you.
02:17:14.48 --> 02:17:18.60 So you might be the master of one particular thing,
02:17:18.60 --> 02:17:21.48 but you have to respect the fact
02:17:21.48 --> 02:17:25.80 that people are gonna be masters at other things
02:17:25.80 --> 02:17:26.64 or better than you.
02:17:26.64 --> 02:17:29.56 And so if you're super strong, that's great.
02:17:29.56 --> 02:17:30.72 Let's see you run a marathon.
02:17:30.72 --> 02:17:33.84 If you're super flexible, awesome,
02:17:33.84 --> 02:17:35.04 how much can you dead left?
02:17:35.04 --> 02:17:37.24 If you're smart, that's great.
02:17:37.24 --> 02:17:38.92 You're smart academically.
02:17:38.92 --> 02:17:40.48 Let's check out your common sense
02:17:40.48 --> 02:17:41.72 and see where all that's at.
02:17:41.72 --> 02:17:45.92 You know, so you're gonna be good at one thing,
02:17:45.92 --> 02:17:48.08 but you're gonna have failed in other areas
02:17:48.08 --> 02:17:49.88 or have weaknesses in other areas.
02:17:49.88 --> 02:17:54.36 And so you just have to keep that in check.
02:17:54.36 --> 02:17:59.36 And I'll tell you, I recognize why I've been successful.
02:18:03.60 --> 02:18:05.96 For one thing, been surrounded with great people,
02:18:05.96 --> 02:18:08.32 for other being lucky in certain situations
02:18:08.32 --> 02:18:09.88 that I've been in certain times,
02:18:09.88 --> 02:18:12.76 and going back to the Jitsu a little bit.
02:18:13.92 --> 02:18:18.92 It's a good example because just because I can beat someone
02:18:18.92 --> 02:18:23.92 in Jitsu, it doesn't mean that I'm a better person.
02:18:24.68 --> 02:18:26.32 Yeah, it does.
02:18:26.32 --> 02:18:28.56 It doesn't mean that I'm a better person.
02:18:28.56 --> 02:18:33.56 What it means, basically, is that I happen to get
02:18:33.92 --> 02:18:37.88 into this random fringe sport before they did.
02:18:37.88 --> 02:18:39.56 And I spent more time on the map than they did.
02:18:39.56 --> 02:18:40.44 That's what it means.
02:18:40.44 --> 02:18:41.64 It doesn't make me better person.
02:18:41.64 --> 02:18:43.96 And I'll tell you what, it goes with,
02:18:43.96 --> 02:18:47.20 you know, if you feel like you're smarter than someone,
02:18:47.20 --> 02:18:50.08 it's probably because you've had the opportunity
02:18:50.08 --> 02:18:53.12 to study a subject or you've had a bunch of education
02:18:53.12 --> 02:18:55.24 on something, you've dove into some subjects
02:18:55.24 --> 02:18:57.20 so that might make you seem smarter.
02:18:57.20 --> 02:18:59.52 Whereas if they applied themselves in that particular,
02:18:59.52 --> 02:19:01.64 because what they were applying themselves is something else.
02:19:01.64 --> 02:19:06.64 So yeah, stay, you gotta stay humble with that.
02:19:07.16 --> 02:19:10.64 And also, we talked about this,
02:19:10.64 --> 02:19:14.16 when you, oh, you don't, I am smarter than this person.
02:19:14.16 --> 02:19:15.88 We'll guess what, there's something
02:19:15.88 --> 02:19:17.72 that they're better than you.
02:19:17.72 --> 02:19:18.72 And what is it?
02:19:18.72 --> 02:19:20.36 You might be smarter than them, I guess what?
02:19:20.36 --> 02:19:21.88 Maybe it's a guy we talked about earlier,
02:19:21.88 --> 02:19:23.44 where I'm smarter as I could be,
02:19:23.44 --> 02:19:25.28 guess what, this person can physically take me down
02:19:25.28 --> 02:19:27.24 and dominate me, and that's horrible.
02:19:27.24 --> 02:19:29.36 Or they're better at whatever, better athletically,
02:19:29.36 --> 02:19:32.20 or some people are really good craftsmen with their hands.
02:19:32.20 --> 02:19:33.64 I mean, there's so many different things
02:19:33.64 --> 02:19:35.56 that you can be skilled at.
02:19:35.56 --> 02:19:39.04 And if you start thinking that yourself
02:19:39.04 --> 02:19:43.44 that you're better than other people,
02:19:43.44 --> 02:19:46.28 you're gonna have issues because in the long run,
02:19:47.32 --> 02:19:50.04 you wanna stay humble, just stay alive,
02:19:50.04 --> 02:19:52.44 because life will humble you.
02:19:52.44 --> 02:19:55.96 Life is hard, and if you're pushing hard,
02:19:55.96 --> 02:19:59.04 and you're driving hard, and you're trying to achieve a lot,
02:19:59.04 --> 02:20:00.60 you're not always gonna win.
02:20:00.60 --> 02:20:02.16 I don't care who you are, you're gonna get humble.
02:20:02.16 --> 02:20:03.96 It's gonna be hard.
02:20:03.96 --> 02:20:06.20 So many, so many people that are successful,
02:20:06.20 --> 02:20:09.04 they've got some hard luck stories along the way
02:20:09.04 --> 02:20:10.88 of things that they had to push through
02:20:10.88 --> 02:20:12.28 and overcome in order to get there.
02:20:12.28 --> 02:20:13.68 They got humble.
02:20:13.68 --> 02:20:18.28 And if you're winning every single time,
02:20:18.28 --> 02:20:22.92 then you're not your goals or height enough.
02:20:22.92 --> 02:20:24.08 So step those up.
02:20:24.08 --> 02:20:28.28 So, you know, I appreciate the kind of comment,
02:20:28.28 --> 02:20:31.40 but man, it's not hard to be humble.
02:20:31.40 --> 02:20:34.44 When you just take, like maybe someone,
02:20:34.44 --> 02:20:39.44 and people always think, oh, oh, he's a Navy seal, whatever.
02:20:39.44 --> 02:20:43.68 You know, there's a lot of seals
02:20:43.68 --> 02:20:45.80 that are more badass than me,
02:20:45.80 --> 02:20:47.32 that done more deployments,
02:20:47.32 --> 02:20:49.36 that have gotten after it more than me.
02:20:49.36 --> 02:20:51.96 And I know that, that's awesome.
02:20:51.96 --> 02:20:54.36 I mean, good, good for them.
02:20:54.36 --> 02:20:58.36 You know, they got after it, good.
02:20:59.28 --> 02:21:02.60 So I don't feel like, oh, I did more than everybody.
02:21:02.60 --> 02:21:04.84 No, there's no one like that.
02:21:04.84 --> 02:21:07.000 There's no one like that, even, you know,
02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:08.84 Mikey Thornton, who won't see all that
02:21:08.84 --> 02:21:11.24 one of the metal varnish, awesome guy of,
02:21:11.24 --> 02:21:12.92 you know, just to just to, you know,
02:21:12.92 --> 02:21:16.04 he's a hero, but if you know,
02:21:16.04 --> 02:21:16.80 he gets interviewed,
02:21:16.80 --> 02:21:18.56 if it's watched a bunch of interviewed here
02:21:18.56 --> 02:21:20.84 and heard him talk, he's like, you know,
02:21:20.84 --> 02:21:22.96 he's like, oh, you know, you got the metal varnish
02:21:22.96 --> 02:21:23.96 that's not mine.
02:21:23.96 --> 02:21:26.56 It's my guys, you know, it's a guy that I was with,
02:21:26.56 --> 02:21:27.44 represents all.
02:21:27.44 --> 02:21:30.80 So, there's a guy like who's gonna be,
02:21:30.80 --> 02:21:32.60 if there's anyone in the world that needs to,
02:21:32.60 --> 02:21:36.000 that could not be humble, maybe it's Mikey Thornton.
02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:37.92 But guess what, Mikey Thornton,
02:21:37.92 --> 02:21:39.44 he's as humble as they come,
02:21:39.44 --> 02:21:42.60 because you know what, he also has been humbled by combat,
02:21:42.60 --> 02:21:44.88 because he realizes things that he tried to do
02:21:44.88 --> 02:21:46.24 that he didn't get done.
02:21:46.24 --> 02:21:48.80 There's lives he tried to save that he couldn't save.
02:21:48.80 --> 02:21:51.36 So, you're gonna, there's no doubt
02:21:51.36 --> 02:21:54.000 if you're living the right life,
02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:55.44 you're gonna be humbled by it.
02:21:55.44 --> 02:21:58.80 And there's always, always, always gonna be somebody
02:21:58.80 --> 02:22:02.20 that's better than you that's done by the way.
02:22:02.20 --> 02:22:04.52 What does being cocky get you anyways?
02:22:04.52 --> 02:22:05.96 What does that turn you into?
02:22:05.96 --> 02:22:08.04 What, I talked about something,
02:22:08.04 --> 02:22:10.80 what is over confidence gets you start cutting corners,
02:22:10.80 --> 02:22:13.52 you start slack, I mean, it's just ridiculous.
02:22:13.52 --> 02:22:16.32 So, you gotta stay humble, you gotta stay hungry
02:22:16.32 --> 02:22:18.28 if you, if you wanna stay in the game
02:22:18.28 --> 02:22:21.08 and believe me, you wanna stay in the game.
02:22:21.08 --> 02:22:23.12 If you wanna stay in the game.
02:22:23.12 --> 02:22:28.12 Did you think that, like, and I can't,
02:22:28.12 --> 02:22:30.44 I mean, I don't know if, maybe this is where
02:22:30.44 --> 02:22:33.76 this even the question is coming from, but,
02:22:33.76 --> 02:22:37.56 if, you know, when you're insecure and you're just,
02:22:37.56 --> 02:22:39.48 like, everything's a competition,
02:22:39.48 --> 02:22:41.000 like, just in life, it's like,
02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.24 it goes beyond just what you're into.
02:22:43.24 --> 02:22:45.68 It's just like, if someone's better than me,
02:22:45.68 --> 02:22:48.28 for it makes me mad, it makes you uneasy or whatever.
02:22:48.28 --> 02:22:50.36 It's like this insecurity kind of thing.
02:22:50.36 --> 02:22:53.72 So, if you look at everything, it's just this big life
02:22:53.72 --> 02:22:55.28 compared, like, I gotta beat that guy,
02:22:55.28 --> 02:22:56.36 I gotta be better than them.
02:22:56.36 --> 02:22:58.32 So, when you are better than them,
02:22:58.32 --> 02:23:00.64 it's like you're still looking at this competition,
02:23:00.64 --> 02:23:03.24 like, you know, like, you're not on my level,
02:23:03.24 --> 02:23:05.000 so you don't deserve to be treated.
02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:08.000 It's kind of like, maybe this is a good analogy,
02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:09.20 maybe not, but like in Gigietsu,
02:23:09.20 --> 02:23:12.12 where if you roll with a white belt, you don't go hard.
02:23:12.12 --> 02:23:13.92 You don't get satisfaction or whatever.
02:23:13.92 --> 02:23:16.76 So, in the Gigietsu competition arena,
02:23:16.76 --> 02:23:18.52 you're not giving them the respect.
02:23:18.52 --> 02:23:21.68 You're not going all out like you would,
02:23:21.68 --> 02:23:24.12 you're not respecting his farm bar.
02:23:24.12 --> 02:23:26.12 If you are, you're smashing him, no satisfaction,
02:23:26.12 --> 02:23:26.96 you know, whatever.
02:23:26.96 --> 02:23:29.68 It's in that specific competition setting.
02:23:29.68 --> 02:23:31.000 But if you're just an insecure person,
02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:34.60 where you think that all life is like just one big competition,
02:23:34.60 --> 02:23:35.80 oh, you gotta smash that person.
02:23:35.80 --> 02:23:37.96 Yeah, and if you're not worthy of my smashing,
02:23:37.96 --> 02:23:39.64 it's like, I don't even treat you,
02:23:39.64 --> 02:23:42.44 like you should be on the mat with you in a single.
02:23:42.44 --> 02:23:45.04 But, maybe I mean, do you think that maybe that's where
02:23:45.04 --> 02:23:46.28 some of that comes from?
02:23:46.28 --> 02:23:50.72 Like, if you're having trouble, like, being humble,
02:23:50.72 --> 02:23:52.40 it's kind of like, I'm just better than you in life.
02:23:52.40 --> 02:23:53.48 Yeah, it's probably just kind of,
02:23:53.48 --> 02:23:55.80 just to living from, in its insecurity.
02:23:55.80 --> 02:23:58.64 But there's also a, there's a dichotomy there too,
02:23:58.64 --> 02:24:01.40 because man, I like to win.
02:24:01.40 --> 02:24:02.68 Like, like, no doubt about it.
02:24:02.68 --> 02:24:04.28 I like to win.
02:24:04.28 --> 02:24:05.96 And the dichotomy of it is,
02:24:05.96 --> 02:24:09.92 is that I also don't literally don't care.
02:24:09.92 --> 02:24:12.48 Like, if I get beat, I'm like, okay, well,
02:24:12.48 --> 02:24:13.96 what can I do to get better?
02:24:13.96 --> 02:24:19.96 It's not, I don't feel this despair
02:24:20.04 --> 02:24:23.24 because I lost losing actually kind of motivates me more.
02:24:23.24 --> 02:24:24.56 Right, yeah.
02:24:24.56 --> 02:24:28.48 As opposed to getting angry and the worst thing that happens
02:24:28.48 --> 02:24:30.20 is people decide they're not going to compete, right?
02:24:30.20 --> 02:24:32.56 They're not going to compete in the game of life
02:24:32.56 --> 02:24:34.96 because they didn't win or they don't feel like they can win.
02:24:34.96 --> 02:24:37.68 So they go, ah, you know what, I'm just going to,
02:24:37.68 --> 02:24:39.76 if I'm just going to back off, I'm just not going to participate
02:24:39.76 --> 02:24:40.60 in the game.
02:24:40.60 --> 02:24:44.04 But getting the game, getting the game,
02:24:44.04 --> 02:24:45.68 yeah, huh.
02:24:45.68 --> 02:24:51.68 So maybe it comes from not understanding what that means
02:24:51.68 --> 02:24:54.12 when you win and stuff.
02:24:56.64 --> 02:24:57.48 I get, I guess.
02:24:57.48 --> 02:24:59.000 You know, like, let's say like, like,
02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:00.96 the fight back to the fighting situation
02:25:00.96 --> 02:25:03.28 where about, you know, being a secure part
02:25:03.28 --> 02:25:05.44 of the male balancing and real psyche.
02:25:05.44 --> 02:25:08.04 If you know that you've achieved these skills,
02:25:08.04 --> 02:25:10.56 have these skills to win people, you know,
02:25:10.56 --> 02:25:12.20 who don't have your skill set,
02:25:12.20 --> 02:25:14.16 you don't want to fight them.
02:25:14.16 --> 02:25:15.88 So you're just like whatever.
02:25:15.88 --> 02:25:18.28 But let's say like, you have a better skill set.
02:25:18.28 --> 02:25:21.52 Yet you're still blowing your horn about your skill set.
02:25:21.52 --> 02:25:23.32 You're not humble about it.
02:25:23.32 --> 02:25:25.56 It's like it comes from maybe, I don't know,
02:25:25.56 --> 02:25:26.40 some of the things.
02:25:26.40 --> 02:25:28.48 There's no doubt there can be some insecurity
02:25:28.48 --> 02:25:34.48 that charges that makes people super competitive
02:25:34.96 --> 02:25:37.80 beyond the healthy, compared to like in life.
02:25:37.80 --> 02:25:41.08 Like I'm just in life, you know, no matter what,
02:25:41.08 --> 02:25:43.56 which again, there's people that are that way,
02:25:43.56 --> 02:25:45.12 myself included.
02:25:45.12 --> 02:25:48.28 And but again, the dichotomy is,
02:25:48.28 --> 02:25:49.16 I don't think you're like that.
02:25:49.16 --> 02:25:51.72 No, no, I know I am.
02:25:51.72 --> 02:25:53.36 Well, I know I am.
02:25:53.36 --> 02:25:55.92 Remember echelon front, remember the logo?
02:25:55.92 --> 02:25:57.08 Yeah, right.
02:25:57.08 --> 02:25:59.88 And I'm gonna post this on Twitter too.
02:25:59.88 --> 02:26:02.72 Jockel made the original echelon front logo.
02:26:02.72 --> 02:26:03.64 This is like long time ago.
02:26:03.64 --> 02:26:04.48 Yeah, yeah.
02:26:04.48 --> 02:26:06.56 And you're like, hey, you know, this is the logo,
02:26:06.56 --> 02:26:07.88 something like this.
02:26:07.88 --> 02:26:11.88 And then basically, but you didn't care that it was junk.
02:26:11.88 --> 02:26:14.68 No, no, but I all I want to do is get you the idea.
02:26:14.68 --> 02:26:16.12 You weren't competing with me.
02:26:16.12 --> 02:26:18.000 But you drew an idol, but like it,
02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:19.88 like as someone who's competing in everything in life,
02:26:19.88 --> 02:26:21.60 like if you draw something and I draw something,
02:26:21.60 --> 02:26:23.000 you're like, I want to make my better.
02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:23.80 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
02:26:23.80 --> 02:26:27.24 But well, see, I wanted to win with the idea,
02:26:27.24 --> 02:26:28.56 not with the skill, the idea.
02:26:28.56 --> 02:26:29.40 The idea.
02:26:29.40 --> 02:26:30.56 I wanted to win the war.
02:26:30.56 --> 02:26:34.04 Not the short-term battles like who can draw this thing better.
02:26:34.04 --> 02:26:38.36 The war was who comes up with a strategic victory,
02:26:38.36 --> 02:26:43.24 which the icon and the symbol for echelon front
02:26:43.24 --> 02:26:45.56 is the one that I drew.
02:26:45.56 --> 02:26:46.36 I liked it.
02:26:46.36 --> 02:26:48.72 Ha ha.
02:26:48.72 --> 02:26:49.64 Sir, yes.
02:26:49.64 --> 02:26:51.36 I didn't care that it looked like junk,
02:26:51.36 --> 02:26:53.76 because I was, did it with your hood post,
02:26:53.76 --> 02:26:54.60 so that's pretty funny.
02:26:54.60 --> 02:26:57.04 I did it on PowerPoint with like a crayon,
02:26:57.04 --> 02:27:00.44 looks like a crayon, because I didn't want to take one time with it.
02:27:00.44 --> 02:27:03.12 I know, I knew that that thing would take you 15 minutes
02:27:03.12 --> 02:27:07.40 to make on your, what is it, AI, ill, illistory,
02:27:07.40 --> 02:27:08.72 yeah, man, no, long time.
02:27:08.72 --> 02:27:10.72 And I was like, that might have been,
02:27:10.72 --> 02:27:12.48 don't be mad at me.
02:27:12.48 --> 02:27:16.56 That's probably the first logo that I've actually made.
02:27:16.56 --> 02:27:17.56 Maybe.
02:27:17.56 --> 02:27:18.40 There you go.
02:27:18.40 --> 02:27:19.40 It was very successful.
02:27:19.40 --> 02:27:21.44 Yeah, whoo.
02:27:21.44 --> 02:27:23.84 Thanks for trusting me.
02:27:23.84 --> 02:27:25.04 Next question.
02:27:25.04 --> 02:27:32.44 What do you do when you have two extreme ownership believers
02:27:32.44 --> 02:27:35.28 that have to go against each other?
02:27:35.28 --> 02:27:36.28 Ooh.
02:27:36.28 --> 02:27:40.12 Sounds like a big challenging question,
02:27:40.12 --> 02:27:43.32 but it actually shouldn't be because if you think about this,
02:27:43.32 --> 02:27:44.72 if you truly think about this,
02:27:44.72 --> 02:27:47.92 this should not be an issue, and here's why,
02:27:47.92 --> 02:27:51.68 we go against each other, against each other.
02:27:51.68 --> 02:27:53.56 So what are the goals?
02:27:53.56 --> 02:27:55.48 Are these two people on the same team?
02:27:55.48 --> 02:27:57.40 I'm assuming that they're on the same team, right?
02:27:57.40 --> 02:27:58.68 They're on the same team.
02:27:58.68 --> 02:28:01.60 So if they're on the same team, and we want to win,
02:28:02.80 --> 02:28:05.08 we have the same goals we want to win,
02:28:05.08 --> 02:28:06.64 but we won't work together.
02:28:07.52 --> 02:28:09.76 Because if the goal is to win,
02:28:09.76 --> 02:28:12.16 and we both want to win,
02:28:12.16 --> 02:28:15.64 why would we be going against each other?
02:28:15.64 --> 02:28:19.36 We are not taking actual extreme ownership.
02:28:19.36 --> 02:28:21.32 Because if you and I were had opposing ideas,
02:28:21.32 --> 02:28:23.12 but we had the same long term goal,
02:28:23.12 --> 02:28:24.12 I'm going to take ownership and say,
02:28:24.12 --> 02:28:25.72 all right, Echo, we got to come to terms here,
02:28:25.72 --> 02:28:27.16 we're going to work this out, we're going to figure it out.
02:28:27.16 --> 02:28:28.04 And if you were doing the same thing,
02:28:28.04 --> 02:28:29.04 you'd be like, yeah, absolutely.
02:28:29.04 --> 02:28:30.24 Let's sit down, let's figure this out,
02:28:30.24 --> 02:28:31.44 let's figure out which one would be the best ones to take
02:28:31.44 --> 02:28:32.88 to market, let's do it to market system.
02:28:32.88 --> 02:28:34.76 We're going to figure out a real solution,
02:28:34.76 --> 02:28:36.28 because we're taking ownership of it.
02:28:36.28 --> 02:28:39.92 So what's the little nugget that's getting into the system here
02:28:39.92 --> 02:28:43.12 in screwing things up into 80 to ego, 100%.
02:28:43.12 --> 02:28:45.52 And I will say this.
02:28:45.52 --> 02:28:50.52 Occasionally, the ideal extreme ownership can be very poorly
02:28:51.96 --> 02:28:55.48 and very incorrectly interpreted as micro management
02:28:55.48 --> 02:28:56.56 in ego media.
02:28:56.56 --> 02:29:01.56 Meaning, I'm going to own this, I own this, this is mine, right?
02:29:01.72 --> 02:29:05.84 We're not, that's not what extreme ownership is at all.
02:29:05.84 --> 02:29:08.80 It's, you've got to own everything,
02:29:08.80 --> 02:29:13.80 but you don't feel the intrinsic need to do everything, right?
02:29:17.68 --> 02:29:22.20 Because you own, it's like owning the outcome
02:29:22.20 --> 02:29:27.20 and owning the progress and owning the steps along the way
02:29:27.80 --> 02:29:30.68 and owning the responsibility of mission achievement,
02:29:30.68 --> 02:29:34.60 it doesn't mean that you own each individual step
02:29:34.60 --> 02:29:36.72 and you have to make it your way.
02:29:36.72 --> 02:29:39.64 That's not extreme ownership, that's micro management.
02:29:40.92 --> 02:29:45.92 But, you know, extreme ownership is about leadership
02:29:45.92 --> 02:29:48.96 and decentralized command
02:29:48.96 --> 02:29:51.88 that using indirect tactics to make things happen
02:29:51.88 --> 02:29:54.48 and owning the outcome.
02:29:54.48 --> 02:29:57.76 So that's why, when you have two people
02:29:57.76 --> 02:30:02.44 that were truly about like, hey, I'm going to own this.
02:30:02.44 --> 02:30:04.48 I'm going to have the attitude to extreme ownership
02:30:04.48 --> 02:30:07.24 if you and I have the attitude to extreme ownership,
02:30:07.24 --> 02:30:08.88 we're not going to fight over anything
02:30:08.88 --> 02:30:11.80 because we have the same long term goal.
02:30:11.80 --> 02:30:14.88 And if you come up with a better idea of how to get there,
02:30:14.88 --> 02:30:18.72 I'm going to say, oh, echo, awesome job.
02:30:18.72 --> 02:30:21.84 That's a great way we're going to get to where we want to go.
02:30:21.84 --> 02:30:24.32 We own that outcome, we're going to make it happen.
02:30:24.32 --> 02:30:26.12 Boom, I'm going to support you.
02:30:26.12 --> 02:30:28.04 The only time it's going to be a problem
02:30:28.04 --> 02:30:31.16 is if I have an ego and then you have an ego.
02:30:31.16 --> 02:30:34.36 When we both have an ego issue,
02:30:34.36 --> 02:30:38.16 and usually one person with a big ego,
02:30:39.24 --> 02:30:43.20 that that inflames other people's use.
02:30:43.20 --> 02:30:45.12 Because if I say, hey, echo,
02:30:45.12 --> 02:30:46.64 I got a great plan for how to do this.
02:30:46.64 --> 02:30:48.76 We need to execute it my way.
02:30:48.76 --> 02:30:50.84 There's a little bit of ego coming out of this.
02:30:50.84 --> 02:30:53.000 Because now your ego was down,
02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:53.84 but I wasn't even ready.
02:30:53.84 --> 02:30:55.32 What do you mean your way?
02:30:55.32 --> 02:30:57.44 Wait a second, just right there, now we got a thing.
02:30:57.44 --> 02:30:59.32 Now we got some cop kind of issue going.
02:30:59.32 --> 02:31:02.52 We're now we're working against each other
02:31:02.52 --> 02:31:03.80 instead of working together.
02:31:03.80 --> 02:31:08.68 So that is absolutely problematic.
02:31:08.68 --> 02:31:11.84 And I guess to say, to put this in a nutshell,
02:31:11.84 --> 02:31:15.28 the way if you're using the principle
02:31:15.28 --> 02:31:18.84 of extreme ownership, the most important thing
02:31:18.84 --> 02:31:23.12 you need to take extreme ownership of is your own ego.
02:31:23.12 --> 02:31:25.48 And put that thing in check.
02:31:26.68 --> 02:31:30.20 Yeah, it seems like the extreme ownership,
02:31:30.20 --> 02:31:32.72 as far as owning it is essentially
02:31:32.72 --> 02:31:35.40 taking responsibility like at all costs kind of thing
02:31:35.40 --> 02:31:38.20 for more like the bad stuff that happens.
02:31:38.20 --> 02:31:39.76 Oh absolutely bad stuff.
02:31:39.76 --> 02:31:40.60 Absolutely bad stuff.
02:31:40.60 --> 02:31:43.92 But you know, but you're going to take because absolutely,
02:31:43.92 --> 02:31:46.76 if you and I do something great together
02:31:46.76 --> 02:31:49.76 and I was the leader, I don't go, yes, that's right.
02:31:49.76 --> 02:31:53.60 I was the, you know, you say, hey, first of all,
02:31:53.60 --> 02:31:54.72 this is mostly on echo.
02:31:54.72 --> 02:31:55.72 He did most of the work.
02:31:55.72 --> 02:31:57.36 He did all the, you know, that's what I'm going to say.
02:31:57.36 --> 02:31:59.16 I'm not going to say, no, this is mine.
02:31:59.16 --> 02:32:01.36 But when something goes wrong, obviously,
02:32:01.36 --> 02:32:02.84 I don't say no, is that a goes fault?
02:32:02.84 --> 02:32:05.04 No, I say, hey, this is my fault.
02:32:05.04 --> 02:32:07.36 So you know, I should have done double check on the audio
02:32:07.36 --> 02:32:09.80 before we started the podcast because, you know,
02:32:09.80 --> 02:32:12.56 we wanted to make sure that thing was recording.
02:32:12.56 --> 02:32:13.40 Right.
02:32:13.40 --> 02:32:15.76 I don't say no echo drop the ball.
02:32:15.76 --> 02:32:16.60 Yeah, I don't do that.
02:32:16.60 --> 02:32:17.44 I don't have.
02:32:17.44 --> 02:32:18.92 I say, hey, you should have double checked.
02:32:18.92 --> 02:32:22.16 So that's if you truly have two people
02:32:22.16 --> 02:32:25.84 that have real ownership and they put the re-goes in check,
02:32:25.84 --> 02:32:27.96 this is literally not an issue.
02:32:27.96 --> 02:32:28.80 Right.
02:32:28.80 --> 02:32:30.52 So they, yeah, this isn't even a question for that right,
02:32:30.52 --> 02:32:32.04 because they don't go against each other.
02:32:32.04 --> 02:32:33.12 No, they're going with each other.
02:32:33.12 --> 02:32:37.28 And so what are the chances that you, as a person,
02:32:37.28 --> 02:32:38.92 that's really put your ego in check
02:32:38.92 --> 02:32:40.76 and you're exercising your ownership?
02:32:40.76 --> 02:32:44.40 What are the chances that you work
02:32:44.40 --> 02:32:46.76 with another person that is exactly
02:32:47.92 --> 02:32:50.28 with the same mindset taking ownership?
02:32:50.28 --> 02:32:51.36 But no ego.
02:32:51.36 --> 02:32:53.76 What are the chances that they're actually pretty slim?
02:32:53.76 --> 02:32:54.84 This is not easy to do.
02:32:54.84 --> 02:32:57.000 This, it's simple, not easy, right?
02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:02.000 So that means you have to be even more proactive
02:33:02.20 --> 02:33:07.04 in helping adapt to their ego scenario that's happening
02:33:07.04 --> 02:33:09.48 and when echo says, hey, we need to do this my way.
02:33:09.48 --> 02:33:10.96 I'll be like, hey, you know what echo?
02:33:10.96 --> 02:33:11.72 Let's take a look at it.
02:33:11.72 --> 02:33:13.56 Absolutely, you've always come up with great plans.
02:33:13.56 --> 02:33:15.64 Let's take a look at what this one is here.
02:33:15.64 --> 02:33:18.000 And all of a sudden, I've disarmed you a little bit.
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:19.64 You're feeling good about it, you're like,
02:33:19.64 --> 02:33:20.48 oh yeah, that's right.
02:33:20.48 --> 02:33:22.80 Jock was gonna listen to me, because that's great.
02:33:22.80 --> 02:33:24.28 That's exactly what I want you to think.
02:33:24.28 --> 02:33:26.12 It's exactly what I want you to think.
02:33:26.12 --> 02:33:28.56 So you're gonna have work to do.
02:33:28.56 --> 02:33:29.80 You're gonna have work to do.
02:33:29.80 --> 02:33:32.76 That's what that's what, that's what it is.
02:33:32.76 --> 02:33:34.04 It's a challenge, it's work.
02:33:34.04 --> 02:33:36.60 But when you have the basic principles,
02:33:36.60 --> 02:33:37.68 the nation say basically,
02:33:37.68 --> 02:33:39.92 you have the fundamental principles,
02:33:39.92 --> 02:33:42.04 they are going to work well for you.
02:33:42.04 --> 02:33:44.56 And when they're not working well for you,
02:33:44.56 --> 02:33:46.64 don't get mad at the other person and blame
02:33:46.64 --> 02:33:48.68 there you go, look at your own ego,
02:33:48.68 --> 02:33:52.000 because you can adjust an adapt and maneuver
02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.56 and get that person disarmed.
02:33:54.56 --> 02:33:57.32 And you can flank them and then you're gonna win.
02:33:57.32 --> 02:34:00.36 That's so interesting that how this question is like that.
02:34:00.36 --> 02:34:03.04 Like it seems like when I first read it,
02:34:03.04 --> 02:34:05.16 I was like, oh shoot, that's a good question, you know?
02:34:05.16 --> 02:34:08.28 When there, and it is, but in a different way,
02:34:08.28 --> 02:34:10.20 because this question is essentially what it does
02:34:10.20 --> 02:34:12.76 is it like what he call it, like a strainer or whatever.
02:34:12.76 --> 02:34:16.88 Like it shifts, it shifts, it strains out the guy
02:34:16.88 --> 02:34:18.68 who's not doing extreme ownership.
02:34:18.68 --> 02:34:21.32 See how it says if they're both exercising it?
02:34:21.32 --> 02:34:22.44 But if they're going against each other,
02:34:22.44 --> 02:34:23.84 that means there's some extreme ownership,
02:34:23.84 --> 02:34:25.16 not being practiced somewhere in here.
02:34:25.16 --> 02:34:28.40 We just know, but we're gonna, we can find out, you know?
02:34:28.40 --> 02:34:29.68 Who's going against who kind of thing?
02:34:29.68 --> 02:34:31.04 If they're both going against each other,
02:34:31.04 --> 02:34:33.28 well, maybe they both have it, you know?
02:34:33.28 --> 02:34:34.88 But there's always gonna be one person.
02:34:34.88 --> 02:34:38.000 You will not always, but there's using me one person
02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:41.40 that is got it.
02:34:41.40 --> 02:34:42.64 Good that understands it.
02:34:42.64 --> 02:34:44.16 And that's gonna be working in this guy.
02:34:44.16 --> 02:34:48.000 It's just so good and so smooth and so tactical.
02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:48.96 And they're gonna win.
02:34:48.96 --> 02:34:51.88 And that other person, that's right, you know,
02:34:51.88 --> 02:34:54.48 I were winning because I got extreme ownership going on.
02:34:54.48 --> 02:34:56.08 And I took ownership of this project.
02:34:56.08 --> 02:34:56.96 And you know what the guy says?
02:34:56.96 --> 02:35:00.84 Like the real, the real leader is like absolutely man.
02:35:00.84 --> 02:35:02.16 You did a great job with that.
02:35:02.16 --> 02:35:04.88 And meanwhile he knows he just made his manipulated
02:35:04.88 --> 02:35:06.88 and flanked him and made it happen
02:35:06.88 --> 02:35:09.80 to the best of the team.
02:35:09.80 --> 02:35:11.64 You know, he's keeping the train going.
02:35:11.64 --> 02:35:12.48 That's good.
02:35:12.48 --> 02:35:13.96 Yeah, he did.
02:35:13.96 --> 02:35:15.24 It's just a thing.
02:35:15.24 --> 02:35:16.08 Okay.
02:35:16.08 --> 02:35:17.08 I think we got last question.
02:35:17.08 --> 02:35:19.04 Yeah, just maybe one more.
02:35:19.04 --> 02:35:19.88 Maybe.
02:35:19.88 --> 02:35:22.64 Uh, talk a little.
02:35:22.64 --> 02:35:24.96 Can you talk about fear of failure
02:35:24.96 --> 02:35:26.20 and how to overcome it?
02:35:28.16 --> 02:35:29.64 Fear of failure.
02:35:31.68 --> 02:35:35.32 So obviously, fear of failure
02:35:35.32 --> 02:35:38.68 can can keep you from taking risk.
02:35:38.68 --> 02:35:41.48 And then it can leave you to sit in there
02:35:41.48 --> 02:35:45.92 paralyzed into not taking any action at all.
02:35:45.92 --> 02:35:50.88 And then obviously, that's bad.
02:35:50.88 --> 02:35:55.88 But I don't actually want you to overcome
02:35:58.20 --> 02:36:00.04 the fear of failure.
02:36:00.04 --> 02:36:05.08 I want you to be afraid of failure.
02:36:05.08 --> 02:36:07.32 Fear of failure is good.
02:36:07.32 --> 02:36:11.52 Fear of failure will keep you up at night,
02:36:11.52 --> 02:36:17.12 planning and rehearsing and going over contingencies.
02:36:17.12 --> 02:36:21.84 Fear of failure will keep you training hard.
02:36:23.12 --> 02:36:27.56 It'll stop you from cutting corners.
02:36:28.76 --> 02:36:33.92 Fear of failure will keep you working and thinking
02:36:33.92 --> 02:36:39.000 and striving and relentlessly trying to be more prepared
02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:42.000 for battle.
02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:47.64 So I want you to be afraid of failing.
02:36:47.64 --> 02:36:49.84 I fear failure.
02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:54.000 But more important.
02:36:55.28 --> 02:36:58.84 I want you to be horrified.
02:36:58.84 --> 02:37:03.32 I want you to be terrified of sitting on your ass
02:37:03.32 --> 02:37:06.04 and doing nothing.
02:37:06.04 --> 02:37:07.92 That is what I want you to be afraid of.
02:37:07.92 --> 02:37:12.76 Of waking up in six days or six weeks or six years
02:37:12.76 --> 02:37:15.16 or 60 years.
02:37:15.16 --> 02:37:18.16 And being no closer to your goal,
02:37:18.16 --> 02:37:21.16 you've made no progress.
02:37:22.80 --> 02:37:25.08 That is the horror.
02:37:25.08 --> 02:37:28.04 That is the nightmare.
02:37:29.04 --> 02:37:33.68 That is what you need to be truly afraid of.
02:37:33.68 --> 02:37:37.68 Being stagnant.
02:37:40.68 --> 02:37:46.68 So get up and go.
02:37:47.68 --> 02:37:54.68 Take the risk, take the gamble, take the first step, take action.
02:37:54.68 --> 02:38:03.68 And don't let another day slip by.
02:38:07.68 --> 02:38:12.68 And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
02:38:12.68 --> 02:38:15.68 And if you got something out of the podcast tonight,
02:38:15.68 --> 02:38:18.68 you want to hear some more.
02:38:18.68 --> 02:38:21.68 Well, then maybe you should go ahead and support the podcast.
02:38:21.68 --> 02:38:26.68 So how can the troopers out there best support the podcast?
02:38:26.68 --> 02:38:31.68 Well, one of the or the initial way is to support yourself at the same time.
02:38:31.68 --> 02:38:36.68 And that is to supplement on it.
02:38:36.68 --> 02:38:39.68 On it has the best supplements.
02:38:39.68 --> 02:38:42.68 You know, it's one thing to say they have the best supplements
02:38:42.68 --> 02:38:43.68 because I like them.
02:38:43.68 --> 02:38:46.68 But they have for real the best supplements.
02:38:46.68 --> 02:38:48.68 Like the legit, you read all the stuff about it.
02:38:48.68 --> 02:38:50.68 It's straight up the best.
02:38:50.68 --> 02:38:51.68 You want 10% off there.
02:38:51.68 --> 02:38:53.68 So support your wallet as well.
02:38:53.68 --> 02:38:56.68 So you're supporting podcasts yourself and your wallet.
02:38:56.68 --> 02:38:58.68 10% off on it.
02:38:58.68 --> 02:38:59.68 That comes.
02:38:59.68 --> 02:39:00.68 Yeah.
02:39:00.68 --> 02:39:02.68 Sorry.
02:39:02.68 --> 02:39:06.68 Also, if you want to passively support, you can do the Amazon click through that's
02:39:06.68 --> 02:39:07.68 you're going to one of the websites.
02:39:07.68 --> 02:39:11.68 Drop podcast.com or or the jocle store is the Amazon link on the top.

02:39:17.68 --> 02:39:20.68 I'm going to ask me, hey, what about this? It's a it's a long story.
02:39:20.68 --> 02:39:22.68 But it's not everywhere overseas.
02:39:22.68 --> 02:39:23.68 It's Canada.

02:39:35.68 --> 02:39:38.68 And so those are up on both websites as well.
02:39:38.68 --> 02:39:40.68 Thanks for hitting me up with that.
02:39:40.68 --> 02:39:42.68 By the way, um,
02:39:42.68 --> 02:39:43.68 Overseas support.

02:39:50.68 --> 02:39:53.68 That's a, that's pretty, it's a cool little tool.
02:39:53.68 --> 02:39:55.68 Thanks again, Brady for that one.
02:39:55.68 --> 02:39:57.68 IT genius.

02:40:03.68 --> 02:40:06.68 You got this a link to it on things called the, called the true
02:40:06.68 --> 02:40:08.68 Jocfac has trooper tool.
02:40:08.68 --> 02:40:09.68 Chrome extension.
02:40:09.68 --> 02:40:10.68 So it's called awesome.
02:40:10.68 --> 02:40:11.68 You click on the thing.
02:40:11.68 --> 02:40:13.68 You just, like, you clean thing.

02:40:20.68 --> 02:40:22.68 You just hide it if you don't want it there.
02:40:22.68 --> 02:40:24.68 But it looks like I think it's kind of cool to up there, whatever.
02:40:24.68 --> 02:40:27.68 Anyway, it helps you go to, it makes you go to Amazon.
02:40:27.68 --> 02:40:29.68 It helps it go through the affiliate link.
02:40:29.68 --> 02:40:31.68 So you don't have to go through the website anymore.
02:40:31.68 --> 02:40:32.68 Does automatically for you.
02:40:32.68 --> 02:40:34.68 So I think, say, say some time.
02:40:34.68 --> 02:40:35.68 Right.
02:40:35.68 --> 02:40:36.68 You know.
02:40:36.68 --> 02:40:41.68 Also, you know, let's course subscribe to the iTunes and you too.
02:40:41.68 --> 02:40:43.68 I think we're going to pump some more value in YouTube.
02:40:43.68 --> 02:40:45.68 But some outtakes on there, I think.
02:40:45.68 --> 02:40:46.68 I like that.
02:40:46.68 --> 02:40:47.68 I like where you're coming from.
02:40:47.68 --> 02:40:48.68 Yeah.

02:41:01.68 --> 02:41:02.68 Yeah.

02:41:06.68 --> 02:41:07.68 JockelStore.com.
02:41:07.68 --> 02:41:08.68 JockelStore.com.
02:41:08.68 --> 02:41:09.68 You know.
02:41:09.68 --> 02:41:10.68 It's cool T-shirts.
02:41:10.68 --> 02:41:12.68 I think I still have yet to see one.
02:41:12.68 --> 02:41:14.68 In the wild.
02:41:14.68 --> 02:41:16.68 Not someone I know.
02:41:16.68 --> 02:41:20.68 So I'm looking forward to seeing that somewhere in the world.
02:41:20.68 --> 02:41:22.68 Somewhere on planet earth.
02:41:22.68 --> 02:41:26.68 I am thoroughly enjoying the pictures that people sent.
02:41:26.68 --> 02:41:27.68 Yeah.
02:41:27.68 --> 02:41:28.68 They're awesome.
02:41:28.68 --> 02:41:29.68 You know what's funny?
02:41:29.68 --> 02:41:31.68 The, the, the, the, the Heather Gray, right?
02:41:31.68 --> 02:41:31.68 Yeah.
02:41:31.68 --> 02:41:32.68 The, the gray.
02:41:32.68 --> 02:41:34.68 So like that's the kind of shirt, like, you know,
02:41:34.68 --> 02:41:35.68 a lot of lighter color shirt.
02:41:35.68 --> 02:41:38.68 They get real, um, like dark if you sweat in on that.
02:41:38.68 --> 02:41:39.68 Right.
02:41:39.68 --> 02:41:39.68 Right.
02:41:39.68 --> 02:41:40.68 So they'll be like pictures.
02:41:40.68 --> 02:41:42.68 I don't even know why I think this funny what it's interesting.
02:41:42.68 --> 02:41:44.68 Because the other one is charcoal gray.
02:41:44.68 --> 02:41:45.68 That's a dark gray.
02:41:45.68 --> 02:41:46.68 So they'll be like, yeah, I got my disability.
02:41:46.68 --> 02:41:48.68 And I see the bottom, like, looks like a stripe.
02:41:48.68 --> 02:41:49.68 I'm like, wait, what?
02:41:49.68 --> 02:41:50.68 That's weird.
02:41:50.68 --> 02:41:51.68 How the lighting is.
02:41:51.68 --> 02:41:52.68 There's a stripe on the bottom.
02:41:52.68 --> 02:41:53.68 You're shirt.
02:41:53.68 --> 02:41:54.68 But it's not the charcoal gray one.
02:41:54.68 --> 02:41:56.68 It's, you know, they're, they're getting after.
02:41:56.68 --> 02:41:58.68 It's in the kitchen of getting after.
02:41:58.68 --> 02:41:59.68 Yes, very much.
02:41:59.68 --> 02:42:01.68 So anyway, I don't know why I thought those.
02:42:01.68 --> 02:42:03.68 But it's, it looks funny.
02:42:03.68 --> 02:42:04.68 Not funny.
02:42:04.68 --> 02:42:05.68 Like I'm laughing at them.
02:42:05.68 --> 02:42:06.68 But it's interesting.
02:42:06.68 --> 02:42:07.68 It looks like a shirt.
02:42:07.68 --> 02:42:08.68 It's like optical illusion.
02:42:08.68 --> 02:42:09.68 Anyway.
02:42:09.68 --> 02:42:10.68 So I'll start a comment.
02:42:10.68 --> 02:42:11.68 There's some other shirts on there.
02:42:11.68 --> 02:42:14.68 If you like them, coffee mugs and stickers.
02:42:14.68 --> 02:42:15.68 Awesome.
02:42:15.68 --> 02:42:16.68 Fumper stick.
02:42:16.68 --> 02:42:22.68 Also, if you like the podcast and you want more of this information,
02:42:22.68 --> 02:42:24.68 there's a book that I wrote with my brother,
02:42:24.68 --> 02:42:25.68 Dave Babin.
02:42:25.68 --> 02:42:26.68 It's called Extreme Ownership.
02:42:26.68 --> 02:42:29.68 You can order it through Amazon.
02:42:29.68 --> 02:42:32.68 Or you can get any more books or sold.

02:42:35.68 --> 02:42:37.68 And the audio format, Dave, and I actually read.
02:42:37.68 --> 02:42:38.68 So get some of that.

02:42:51.68 --> 02:42:53.68 And I am at Jockel Willink.
02:42:53.68 --> 02:42:55.68 We're also on the Facebookie.
02:42:55.68 --> 02:42:58.68 And some of that Instagram.
02:42:58.68 --> 02:43:01.68 I got a snapchat thing.
02:43:01.68 --> 02:43:03.68 I signed up for it or whatever.
02:43:03.68 --> 02:43:05.68 But I haven't done anything with it yet.
02:43:05.68 --> 02:43:06.68 Yeah.
02:43:06.68 --> 02:43:08.68 I got to explore that.
02:43:08.68 --> 02:43:12.68 But man, the social media stuff takes some time.
02:43:12.68 --> 02:43:16.68 And I can't, if you want me, find me on Twitter.
02:43:16.68 --> 02:43:17.68 That's the best way.
02:43:17.68 --> 02:43:20.68 Ask your questions on Twitter, hit me up on Twitter.
02:43:20.68 --> 02:43:24.68 That's the most common thing that I use.
02:43:24.68 --> 02:43:26.68 I do check Facebook.
02:43:26.68 --> 02:43:29.68 I mean, everything that has ever been sent to me, I've read.
02:43:29.68 --> 02:43:32.68 I might not have responded to it because I can't literally
02:43:32.68 --> 02:43:38.68 can't respond to every single thing that gets sent to me, which is what's nice about on Twitter.
02:43:38.68 --> 02:43:40.68 I can just hit that I like it.
02:43:40.68 --> 02:43:43.68 You know, so that people know like, oh, he read it cool on Facebook.
02:43:43.68 --> 02:43:47.68 I read it, but there's nothing to press to say I read your thing.
02:43:47.68 --> 02:43:50.68 So maybe I should figure something out like that.
02:43:50.68 --> 02:43:52.68 But anyways, you're, you're,
02:43:52.68 --> 02:43:55.68 You're, you're, you're, you're, like, you get back to people and stuff, which is cool.
02:43:55.68 --> 02:43:57.68 Because there's some people you can tell.
02:43:57.68 --> 02:43:58.68 It's not that.
02:43:58.68 --> 02:44:00.68 It's like they're social media.
02:44:00.68 --> 02:44:05.68 Yeah, it's me and I was just out where, where I just was, there was very limited internet.
02:44:05.68 --> 02:44:10.68 So I was able to get like a tweet out in the morning, a couple of tweets out in the morning.
02:44:10.68 --> 02:44:17.68 But when I'd go to start responding, it was, you know, three minutes to get to, to look at the tweet for somebody.
02:44:17.68 --> 02:44:21.68 So I'm backed up right now for like five days, four days behind or something like that.
02:44:21.68 --> 02:44:22.68 Five days behind actually.
02:44:22.68 --> 02:44:25.68 Yeah, but see, you mean to say that like that you're like backed up.
02:44:25.68 --> 02:44:28.68 It means like, that you're, you know, you're engagement.
02:44:28.68 --> 02:44:29.68 That's good.
02:44:29.68 --> 02:44:34.68 Yeah, but even then I was reading and I do, man, if you send me something on Twitter,
02:44:34.68 --> 02:44:36.68 I'm going to see, you know, read it.
02:44:36.68 --> 02:44:40.68 I might not respond to it directly, but I might, but I've had a day.
02:44:40.68 --> 02:44:45.68 Actually more than one, too, but I remember in a very specific time, a day where I wasn't going to go to jiu-jitsu.
02:44:45.68 --> 02:44:46.68 I wasn't going to go.
02:44:46.68 --> 02:44:48.68 I was, you know, today's the rest day or what?
02:44:48.68 --> 02:44:49.68 I don't know, whatever.
02:44:49.68 --> 02:44:50.68 I wasn't going to go.
02:44:50.68 --> 02:44:51.68 We can't, we call that weakness.
02:44:51.68 --> 02:44:54.68 Maybe, call it what you want.
02:44:54.68 --> 02:44:58.68 Nonetheless, when you see pictures of, I saw,
02:44:58.68 --> 02:45:02.68 I, I, I don't know the, the, the name of the specific person, but I saw a picture.
02:45:02.68 --> 02:45:04.68 First day of jiu-jitsu.
02:45:04.68 --> 02:45:08.68 And I'm like, you know, you get that feeling when, like, let's say you were in that jiu-jitsu.
02:45:08.68 --> 02:45:12.68 And I took a picture of me on the mat saying, I'm here without jockel.
02:45:12.68 --> 02:45:15.68 I'll do that everyone's wanting like my friends around here without jocquins.
02:45:15.68 --> 02:45:19.68 You kind of like, you have this feeling like dang, I wish I was there right now, just to whatever.
02:45:19.68 --> 02:45:22.68 I kind of got that feeling that weird competitiveness you were talking about.
02:45:22.68 --> 02:45:25.68 No, it's more like, I want to be there with you.
02:45:25.68 --> 02:45:26.68 Maybe, maybe a little bit.
02:45:26.68 --> 02:45:33.68 But by the way, I don't know if you do this, you know, like, guys would be like, hey, I want to come visit you at the jammer when I'm right.
02:45:33.68 --> 02:45:36.68 And to me, it's like, you know, a guy showed up because when I was out of town.
02:45:36.68 --> 02:45:40.68 Yeah, and you know, I, I say the days like I go on these these days typically and whatever.
02:45:40.68 --> 02:45:44.68 So just hit me up by the beyond Twitter, whatever, if you're in town and put he did.
02:45:44.68 --> 02:45:47.68 And because the, the reason that's significant one of the main reasons what I said to,
02:45:47.68 --> 02:45:49.68 We're busy from Arizona.
02:45:49.68 --> 02:45:51.68 So Arizona is a baby.
02:45:51.68 --> 02:45:54.68 Maybe the man showed up rolled money.
02:45:54.68 --> 02:45:59.68 Yeah, so because a lot of people in life, I'm not saying just on Twitter, I'm just saying in life,
02:45:59.68 --> 02:46:02.68 They always will be like, hey, oh, you do just, so yeah, I'm going to combine.
02:46:02.68 --> 02:46:05.68 You can show me or all roll or whatever.
02:46:05.68 --> 02:46:10.68 And I would say a good 95 to 99% of the time, they don't, they don't come.
02:46:10.68 --> 02:46:12.68 Yeah, well, a lot of times they're hitting you up from,
02:46:12.68 --> 02:46:15.68 Love, please refer than the way that they're doing.
