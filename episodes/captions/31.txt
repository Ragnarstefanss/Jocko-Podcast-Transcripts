[00:00:00] This is Jockel Podcast number 31, with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
[00:00:11] Bernardo Simpson watched three men, including Huto and Hudson, going to a hut with a girl
[00:00:18] aged about 17.
[00:00:21] Her trousers were forcibly removed, the girl was held down while she was violated.
[00:00:27] Simpson observed this from the door.
[00:00:30] Fagan was also part of the girl's ordeal.
[00:00:35] When they were finished, the helpless captive were shot dead.
[00:00:41] Her face completely blown away.
[00:00:44] Tora stabbed several people with a bowie knife and was seen by Huto raping a girl.
[00:00:51] She was crying, fighting, and resisting him.
[00:00:56] The other soldier held her down.
[00:01:00] For Simpson, the crucial moment was when he shot the woman and baby soon after entering
[00:01:06] the village.
[00:01:09] I went to turn her over and there was a little baby with her that I had also killed.
[00:01:15] The baby's face was half gone.
[00:01:18] My mind just went.
[00:01:20] The training came to me and I just started killing.
[00:01:24] Old men, women, children, water buffaloes, everything.
[00:01:31] We were told to leave nothing standing.
[00:01:34] We did what we were told.
[00:01:35] We guardless of whether they were civilians.
[00:01:38] They was the enemy, period, kill.
[00:01:43] If you don't follow a director or you can be shot yourself, now what am I supposed to do?
[00:01:49] You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.
[00:01:53] You didn't have to look for people to kill.
[00:01:56] They were just there.
[00:01:59] I cut their throats, cut off their hands, cut out their tongue, their hair, scalp them.
[00:02:05] I did it.
[00:02:07] A lot of people were doing it and I just followed.
[00:02:09] I just lost all sense of direction.
[00:02:13] I just started killing any kind of way I can kill.
[00:02:16] It just came.
[00:02:18] I didn't know I had it in me.
[00:02:20] After I killed the child, my whole mind just went.
[00:02:25] It just went.
[00:02:27] And after you start, it's very easy to keep on.
[00:02:31] The hardest is to kill the first time, but once you kill, then it becomes easier to kill
[00:02:35] the next person and the next one and the next one.
[00:02:38] Because I had no feelings, no emotion, nothing.
[00:02:43] I just killed.
[00:02:45] I wasn't the only one that did it.
[00:02:47] A lot of people in the company did it.
[00:02:48] I hung them up all types of ways.
[00:02:50] Any type of way that you could kill someone, that's what they did.
[00:02:54] That day in Mealai, I was personally responsible for killing about 25 people personally.
[00:03:02] I don't think beforehand, anyone thought we would kill so many people.
[00:03:06] I mean, we're talking about 4 to 500 people.
[00:03:10] We almost wiped out the whole village, a whole community.
[00:03:14] I can't forget the magnitude of the number of people that we killed and how they were killed
[00:03:19] killed in lots of ways.
[00:03:22] Do you realize what it's like killing 500 people in a matter of 4 or 5 hours?
[00:03:28] It's just like the gas chambers, what Hitler did.
[00:03:31] You line up 50 people, women, old men, children, and just mow them down.
[00:03:38] And that's the way it was.
[00:03:40] We were 25 to 50 to 100, just killed.
[00:03:44] We rounded them up, me and a couple of guys just put the M16 on automatic and just mowed
[00:03:50] them down.
[00:03:59] Good evening, Echo.
[00:04:01] Good evening.
[00:04:04] Well, that was an excerpt from a book called Four Hours in Mealai by Michael
[00:04:15] Building and Kevin Sim.
[00:04:20] And when I was prepping for this, I mentioned to a couple of people that I was going
[00:04:27] to do Mealai on the podcast next.
[00:04:31] And surprisingly, a lot of people didn't know what it was.
[00:04:35] And I thought everybody knew about Mealai.
[00:04:41] Mealai is a war crime.
[00:04:45] It's an atrocity.
[00:04:48] And what makes it so hard to talk about is that it was an atrocity and a war crime that
[00:04:54] was committed by American soldiers.
[00:05:00] Now, of course, there's people out there that like to claim that America is this evil and
[00:05:07] periodic empire, which I am telling you, it is not by any stretch.
[00:05:16] America isn't an incredibly benevolent nation with a conscience and a soul that, as a whole,
[00:05:26] is good.
[00:05:28] And have we done some things in the past that don't reflect that?
[00:05:32] We absolutely have.
[00:05:33] But for the most part, we have stood up for the week.
[00:05:36] We have liberated the oppressed.
[00:05:38] We defeated the Nazis.
[00:05:39] We defeated the imperial Japanese army.
[00:05:42] We give aid and military assistance and education and money to less fortunate people all
[00:05:47] over the world all the time.
[00:05:51] We are a good nation filled with, for the most part, good people, but not all good people.
[00:06:07] And people inside of people, inside of humans, there can be something very dark.
[00:06:19] And sometimes that darkness can override the light.
[00:06:30] And that is exactly what happened in a small village in Vietnam called Me Lie on March 16th,
[00:06:40] 1668, that 0715 in the morning, a massacre in atrocity.
[00:06:55] The murder of hundreds and hundreds of old men, women and children unarmed begging for mercy.
[00:07:06] Not stabbed, blown up, raped, tortured, killed, murdered.
[00:07:21] And no, I don't like talking about this, especially when it's Americans that are committing
[00:07:31] this sin.
[00:07:34] And we talk about the Nazis in Germany and we talk about the Cheshins in Grasini and we
[00:07:39] talk about the Japanese in the Malaysian jungle and the Houtusian Rwanda.
[00:07:45] I don't like that, but this is us.
[00:07:56] And so the question comes, it came into my mind.
[00:08:01] Do I do this?
[00:08:02] Do I talk about this?
[00:08:05] Can I talk about this?
[00:08:07] And the bottom line is not can I.
[00:08:11] But we have to, we have to cover this.
[00:08:14] We have to talk about it.
[00:08:15] We can't ignore it.
[00:08:16] We can't deny it.
[00:08:17] We have to take ownership of it.
[00:08:21] To admit it, to air it out and to keep it in the front of our minds to ensure that we do everything
[00:08:32] we can to make sure nothing like this ever happens again.
[00:08:44] War is hell.
[00:08:48] And me lie is the ninth circle of hell, the worst part.
[00:08:59] And let's go there to make sure we remember.
[00:09:05] And start by looking at the path that led there.
[00:09:13] And in order to look at the path that led there, we're going to start just by a little
[00:09:17] bit of broad strategy.
[00:09:20] Because there's plenty of blame to go around.
[00:09:24] And when you look at the broad strategy in the way it was laid out, here's a little
[00:09:29] piece on General Westmoreland who was running the strategy in Vietnam.
[00:09:34] General Westmoreland's strategy of attrition also had an important effect on our behavior.
[00:09:40] Our mission was not to win terrain or seize positions, but simply to kill.
[00:09:47] To kill Communists and kill as many of them as possible, stack them up like cordwood.
[00:09:53] Victory was a high body count.
[00:09:56] The feet, a low kill ratio, wore a matter of arithmetic.
[00:10:02] The pressure on unit commanders to produce as many corpses was intense and they in turn
[00:10:07] communicated it to their troops.
[00:10:10] It's not surprising, therefore, that some men acquired a contempt for human life and a
[00:10:15] predilection for taking it.
[00:10:20] So that's the environment that you're in.
[00:10:24] The environment that's being encouraged to kill.
[00:10:28] Kill as many as possible.
[00:10:31] That's coming from the top.
[00:10:32] That's the broad strategy.
[00:10:34] Not to win this hill.
[00:10:36] It's a kill.
[00:10:39] And who are you talking to and who's receiving this?
[00:10:41] Here's a little piece on Charlie Company, which is the Army Unit that this is based
[00:10:48] on and that committed this atrocity.
[00:10:51] We were kids, 18, 19 years old.
[00:10:54] I was 21 years old at the time.
[00:10:56] I was one of the oldest people around there among the common grunts.
[00:11:01] Most of them had never been away from home before they went to service and they end up
[00:11:05] in Vietnam.
[00:11:06] Many of them because they thought they were going to do something courageous on behalf
[00:11:09] of their country.
[00:11:12] So young kids.
[00:11:15] And nowadays, if you're young kid, you're 13, 14, 16, 18, you know, guess what?
[00:11:21] You might not have traveled around the world, but you've seen the world because you
[00:11:25] have television.
[00:11:26] You have the internet.
[00:11:27] You can see all these parts of the world.
[00:11:29] You can see all different cultures and people.
[00:11:31] Well, when you're from Iowa in 1967, you don't know anything about this.
[00:11:38] So you're getting next thing, you know, six months later, you're in Vietnam.
[00:11:44] And here is a little bit of where you're going to get your attitude from.
[00:11:50] Back to the book, to the troops of Charlie Company, to American troops in general, all
[00:11:55] Vietnamese were Gooks, Dinks, Dopes, and Slopes.
[00:12:00] So just you could not find the Vietnamese who were their enemy soon struck out wildly
[00:12:04] at the Vietnamese who were supposed to be their friends.
[00:12:08] How can you tell the enemy, Varnoto Simpson, said, they all look the same.
[00:12:13] Which another MII veteran added, in the end, everyone in that country was the enemy.
[00:12:21] In all wars, it is common for the enemy to be dehumanized.
[00:12:25] But in Vietnam, American soldiers also dehumanized their allies.
[00:12:30] Charlie Company had not been in Vietnam long before the pattern of brutality leading to
[00:12:36] me lie began.
[00:12:38] Their own losses and injuries hastened the process.
[00:12:42] Retrid, fear, racism, and revenge turned to beatings torture, rape, murder.
[00:12:50] All these offenses were committed with impunity by individuals and groups from Charlie
[00:12:54] Company in the weeks before the massacre.
[00:12:57] Finally, at MII, they discovered that having dehumanized the Vietnamese, they had also dehumanized
[00:13:05] themselves.
[00:13:09] So you're going to see this escalation.
[00:13:12] And it's just like we talked about with the Russian soldiers in Chechnya and how it starts
[00:13:19] when they don't shave.
[00:13:20] And then they don't clean their weapon and then they don't stand watching and then the
[00:13:23] next thing they're not doing, they're doing their duty and they're being overrun.
[00:13:26] You're going to see a similar escalation here around the lack of discipline, but it's
[00:13:32] in the way that they treat the local populace.
[00:13:36] And you know, I had one of my high school teachers was a Vietnam veteran and when I was
[00:13:44] going to high school, the movie Platoon came out.
[00:13:49] And you can tell, actually, you can tell that the movie Platoon, the book we did,
[00:13:53] Platoon leader by Jim McDonald, there's so many scenes in that book that you can tell all
[00:13:58] of them are read that book and put some of those scenes in the movie.
[00:14:01] There's no doubt about it.
[00:14:02] There's even a character named Barnes in the book and in the movie.
[00:14:08] Well Platoon also showed, you know, a very, it portrayed the Americans in a very rough
[00:14:16] light in many of the situations.
[00:14:19] And when I talked to my one of my teachers in high school that was a Vietnam vet, and
[00:14:24] he just said, you know, the thing that they didn't show very well, because they show
[00:14:28] the guys coming in and really be people, killing people, burning villages.
[00:14:35] And what he said was, you know, Jaka, we would walk around a village and one of our guys
[00:14:41] would hit a booby trap every day, every other day.
[00:14:45] And the villagers are out there walking on the same trails, but they're not getting blown
[00:14:49] up.
[00:14:50] And so after weeks and then months of this happening of me losing two guys, three guys,
[00:14:57] six guys getting blown up, getting killed, losing their legs, losing their arms, losing their
[00:15:02] lives, and the Vietnamese villagers, they're not hitting anything.
[00:15:07] Eventually in in our minds, they become guilty.
[00:15:13] Now when you have leadership that can explain and restrain and control, you can keep that
[00:15:21] stuff controlled.
[00:15:24] But when you have leadership that buys into that attitude, you end up in a very bad
[00:15:28] situation, which is where we're heading here in Mely.
[00:15:36] Now back to the strategy.
[00:15:38] The aim of American strategy was simple to kill via Kong and such large numbers that they
[00:15:43] would not be replaced, or could not be replaced.
[00:15:46] But how was this to be achieved without, at the same time, killing large numbers of civilians?
[00:15:52] This was a problem to which no one on the American side ever discovered a satisfactory answer.
[00:15:58] It was the biggest failure of the war.
[00:16:00] It was a failure magnified enormously by American strategic thinking.
[00:16:06] The Westmoreland Vietnam was a war of attrition, a meat grinder, as they called it in the
[00:16:11] Pentagon.
[00:16:13] The object he explained was to bleed the north to waken in the communist mind, the notion
[00:16:17] that they were draining their population, to the point of national disaster for generations
[00:16:23] to come.
[00:16:24] To achieve this goal and to win a war of attrition, Americans had to kill via Kong fighters
[00:16:30] faster than the communist could replace them.
[00:16:33] As Bifit's a great industrial power, the war was to be fought on an industrial scale.
[00:16:39] Westmoreland like Patton before him intended to construct a killing machine so formidable
[00:16:44] as to be irresistible.
[00:16:47] It sheer size and power would pulverize the enemy in this submission.
[00:16:53] So there you go.
[00:16:55] Once again, it's very clear what the goal was from a strategic level.
[00:17:00] And this kind of spells out how determined they were to do that.
[00:17:09] Back to the book.
[00:17:10] From the beginning of American involvement, it would become common practice for patrols
[00:17:14] to call for artillery or an air strike if they received even sniper fire from a village.
[00:17:19] Irrespective of whether civilians also sheltered there.
[00:17:23] By the end of 1966, fighter bombers were making up to 400 such shorties a day.
[00:17:30] Added to B-52 raids in the country, this meant that around 825 tons of bombs were delivered
[00:17:37] every day.
[00:17:39] A figure that doubled by the tonnage of high explosive fired off by artillery.
[00:17:46] The solution in Vietnam, General Dupri, told the visiting amissary from the Pentagon,
[00:17:53] is more bombs more shells more napaum, till the other side cracks and gives up.
[00:17:59] And that's what they got.
[00:18:01] In 1967, an article in Life Magazine claimed that the cost of killing a single vehicle
[00:18:06] in Gorilla was $400,000, which included the cost of 75 bombs and 150 artillery shells.
[00:18:13] No nation in history had waged a war with such little regard to expense.
[00:18:19] Only days before Mely, Robert McNamara, the retiring secretary of defense, would remind
[00:18:26] an audience gathered to record his farewell from the Pentagon that more bombs had been dropped
[00:18:30] on Vietnam than on the whole of Europe during the whole of World War II.
[00:18:39] So that's crazy.
[00:18:41] Especially for me, from my perspective, having been in the war in Iraq and having known
[00:18:47] guys that fought NAF Afghanistan, this idea that they take sniper fire from a village and
[00:18:54] then call in the air strikes on the village is just something that would not happen.
[00:18:58] Then that's why when people frame America as being this power that just goes and crushes
[00:19:06] and kills all these civilians, I know for a fact it's not true.
[00:19:10] Yes, obviously it happened in Vietnam, but we go through great lengths.
[00:19:15] There were some times I'm telling you, almost sometimes absurd lengths to protect the civilian
[00:19:20] populace in Iraq in Afghanistan.
[00:19:22] I could bring so many people on here on this program, just seals.
[00:19:27] But I could bring anybody from all kinds of every branch of the military to come here
[00:19:31] and say, oh yeah, here's a situation.
[00:19:33] My guys were pinned down under fire.
[00:19:35] We tried to get bombs dropped on this building.
[00:19:37] No one would do it.
[00:19:38] We couldn't do it.
[00:19:39] We weren't allowed to do it.
[00:19:40] And that's the reality today.
[00:19:43] And part of that is we've matured as a nation, obviously we see that that's a problem.
[00:19:48] I mean, this is the way we should fight.
[00:19:51] Sometimes we go too far in one direction.
[00:19:53] This was obviously too far in the other direction.
[00:20:00] In Iraq, I remember you mentioned something about the enemy in Iraq.
[00:20:07] Would you use the civilian populace?
[00:20:09] Oh, there's no doubt about it.
[00:20:11] They're like, they literally used kids as shields.
[00:20:15] They knew our rules of engagement.
[00:20:18] They knew that if they stayed in buildings that were close to a mosque or were close to a
[00:20:22] hospital that we wouldn't bomb it, that we wouldn't hit it with armor.
[00:20:26] So they were very smart about how they took advantage of our rules of engagement.
[00:20:32] And then we had to adjust our tactics.
[00:20:34] So there's no doubt.
[00:20:36] The enemy figures out what your rules of engagement are and then they start to press
[00:20:39] you in the seams of that rules of engagement, to try and take advantage of it, to the best
[00:20:43] their ability.
[00:20:44] Do you think that that's kind of an indicator that they cared about their civilians less
[00:20:51] than you cared about their civilians?
[00:20:53] That is 100% accurate.
[00:20:55] Of course.
[00:20:56] I mean, the al Qaeda insurgents and now the ISIS in Iraq, they don't care about civilian casualties.
[00:21:03] And all, they don't care.
[00:21:05] They literally don't care.
[00:21:06] Their own civilian.
[00:21:07] Their own civilian.
[00:21:08] That's crazy.
[00:21:09] The civilians, again, this is something I never gets portrayed correctly.
[00:21:13] The civilians don't want ISIS in charge.
[00:21:15] The civilians didn't want al Qaeda in charge.
[00:21:17] They knew what that would lead to.
[00:21:21] And yeah, al Qaeda would use their children as shields.
[00:21:25] I mean, I literally had snipers of mine that shot al Qaeda guys carrying machine guns in
[00:21:33] one hand and a baby in the other hand.
[00:21:36] And luckily, we had really good snipers.
[00:21:41] So back to the book here, we get to talk a little bit about the company, the company
[00:21:49] that this is about Charlie Company.
[00:21:52] And a company is the company soldiers generally around 150 people.
[00:21:57] And you'll have three, generally you'll have three platoons in there.
[00:22:02] So your platoons are going to be 40, 50, maybe 60 people.
[00:22:04] Sometimes it's actually a lot more flexible than people realize.
[00:22:07] Sometimes an army company will have five platoons.
[00:22:10] But generally three platoons, what they'll have.
[00:22:13] So we're talking here, probably about 150 guys in Charlie Company.
[00:22:16] And they're guys, they lay out that kind of going to a quick background of the different
[00:22:22] guys.
[00:22:23] And really what an end up showing you is a cross section of America.
[00:22:28] Some highlights, they got a guy named Fred Widmer from North of Pittsburgh.
[00:22:34] He got a guy named Kenneth Hodges from Dublin, Georgia, a farmer's boy.
[00:22:40] You got a guy from Portland, Oregon named Greg Olson, who's a Mormon, a devout Mormon.
[00:22:47] And from a good family, you got another guy named Harry Stanley from Gulfport, Mississippi,
[00:22:55] who was brought up by his mom, who believed in hard work, school, and church on Sundays.
[00:23:01] So you're looking at a fairly normal cross section, Michael Burnhart, came from a middle
[00:23:06] class Catholic family from Long Island.
[00:23:09] So you got just the troops, just a cross section.
[00:23:13] And then you get to one of the leaders in Charlie Company, in charge of Second Platoon.
[00:23:22] And his name was William Laws Callie, Lieutenant Callie.
[00:23:30] And he's going to end up being our the monster here.
[00:23:36] So back to the book, who was Callie?
[00:23:39] In the early 70s, a small industry grew up trying to find the answer.
[00:23:44] Toilers at this trade looked for a monster, but all they found was a non entity.
[00:23:49] A bland young man burdened it seemed with his much ordinaryness as any single individual
[00:23:55] could bear.
[00:23:56] And almost too much of a conventional and common place to retain what is necessary for
[00:24:01] human identity.
[00:24:04] To press Callie to the press, Callie was just about as average in American as ever came
[00:24:10] out of the non-discripped middle class streets of Miami.
[00:24:14] He could be any young American.
[00:24:16] He was the quiet American.
[00:24:18] It was noted with astonishment that he emerged from a background which most would regard
[00:24:23] as coming close to the American ideal.
[00:24:27] Elsewhere it was said that his life could have been lifted from the cover drawing of the
[00:24:31] old Saturday evening post.
[00:24:34] His averageness had made him so invisible at one college he attended that all anyone could
[00:24:39] remember about him was that he paid his rent regularly.
[00:24:45] The many who combed through his life found no shred of deviance.
[00:24:49] And even a single distinctive feature other than his height, 5-4, 5 feet forages.
[00:24:56] He'd come from a stable family.
[00:24:58] He'd been neither particularly popular or unpopular.
[00:25:01] He had no particular talents and few if any enthusiasm.
[00:25:05] Water skiing was the closest he ever got to violence.
[00:25:11] Throughout a long education, he'd shown no aptitude for learning his college career
[00:25:16] simply fizzled out.
[00:25:21] That's one of the things.
[00:25:22] You can see this guy is white bread, plain plain.
[00:25:28] That's what they find about him.
[00:25:33] The company itself, they say back to the book Charlie Company was very average.
[00:25:39] Charlie Company actually reflects Kelly in the fact that Charlie Company as a whole is pretty
[00:25:44] normal for a company of army soldiers in Vietnam.
[00:25:47] An investigation ordered by the Army Chief of Staff in 1970 revealed that 87% of Charlie
[00:25:53] companies and CEOs were high school graduates nearly 20% above the Army's norm.
[00:25:58] Most of the men in Charlie Company were between 18 and 22 years old.
[00:26:01] Nearly half the company was black.
[00:26:03] The peers reported that there was little to distinguish Charlie Company from other
[00:26:07] rifle companies.
[00:26:08] The men were generally representative of the typical cross section of American youth
[00:26:12] assigned to most combat units throughout the Army.
[00:26:15] They brought with them the diverse traits, prejudices, and attitudes typical of the various
[00:26:19] regions of the country and segments of society from whence they came.
[00:26:27] Normal people.
[00:26:29] And why it's important to remember that as we dive into this and as this story develops,
[00:26:35] you're going to see these normal people do completely demonic things.
[00:26:47] And now we talk a little bit here about there in Hawaii and they're going through some
[00:26:52] training to prepare them for Vietnam.
[00:26:59] Back to the book, what most Charlie Company veterans remember about the training was its
[00:27:03] unreality and how little it prepared them for what they had to face in Vietnam.
[00:27:08] For Fred Wittmeer, it seemed they had been preparing for World War II or Korea.
[00:27:14] Cali thought they could go to Vietnam and be Audi Murphy's, kicking the door, running the
[00:27:19] hooch, giving it a good burst kill.
[00:27:23] For Nato Simpson said, you can't have no type of training, can compare with what wars
[00:27:29] like none.
[00:27:31] There's no such thing as preparedness for war.
[00:27:34] We trained and we were so psyched up and they programmed you to kill and to go to Vietnam,
[00:27:40] you know, but once you get there, it's a different situation.
[00:27:48] Now I spent my last three years in the military training guys for war and I'll tell you
[00:27:54] right now, we trained guys really well for war.
[00:27:57] And the training that I received preparing for war did a great job and we improved upon
[00:28:01] that the more combat experience we got, the better we got it training and preparing guys
[00:28:05] for war.
[00:28:08] But you can see how important the training is and the training has got to be realistic
[00:28:16] to the situation that you're going to be put in.
[00:28:19] And clearly, you know, they're then saying that this was like World War II or Korea, well
[00:28:23] in World War II and Korea, there's vast differences between what you're dealing with
[00:28:26] Vietnam.
[00:28:27] World War II or Korea, you're fighting against enemy uniformed troops that are on the other
[00:28:32] side of a line that are attacking you.
[00:28:35] That's what World War II and Korea was very much like for the most part.
[00:28:40] Another person in a different uniform that you are going to fight and kill.
[00:28:45] And here we just have something totally different.
[00:28:47] People that are mixed in with the villages, there's no front line anywhere.
[00:28:51] They're dressing the same.
[00:28:53] Sometimes they have a gun.
[00:28:54] Sometimes they don't, it's an infinitely challenging, more challenging situation.
[00:29:01] Now here we go back to the book.
[00:29:03] According to Cali, the only lesson every GI learned was not to trust anybody.
[00:29:10] It was drummed into us, B-sharp on guard, as soon as you think these people won't kill
[00:29:14] you, zap.
[00:29:16] In combat, you haven't friends, you have enemies.
[00:29:19] Ever and ever again, at OCS we heard this and I told myself, I'll act as if I'm never
[00:29:25] secure.
[00:29:26] As if everyone in Vietnam would do me in, as if everyone is bad.
[00:29:35] Michael Bernhardt was also concerned.
[00:29:37] Charlie Company did not match up to the high standards of order and discipline.
[00:29:40] He had learned at the La Sal military academy.
[00:29:43] So this is one of the soldiers.
[00:29:44] He had gone to a military type high school where they had good discipline.
[00:29:49] They learned about the military.
[00:29:52] And then when he got in, he went to airborne school.
[00:29:54] So he was moral, the higher end soldier.
[00:29:58] Back to the book.
[00:29:59] Trained as a parachute as he was disappointed to have been transferred to a run of the mill
[00:30:02] infantry company.
[00:30:04] Bernhardt was unusual for an enlisted man.
[00:30:06] He was a military animal, a stickler for authority and was happiest when things were being
[00:30:11] done by the book.
[00:30:17] But it was not this system that fathered Bernhardt.
[00:30:21] He believed that good soldiers not only needed discipline, but liked it.
[00:30:27] It was the lax discipline and Charlie Company and the fact that officers did not always
[00:30:31] insist on their orders being carried out out that worried him.
[00:30:35] In an argument with Callie shortly after arriving in Hawaii, he found the young lieutenant
[00:30:40] Callow and lacking in leadership qualities.
[00:30:45] So right now we're already seeing some chinks in the armor of Lieutenant Callie.
[00:30:51] And if you remember what Hackworth said about me lie, he talked about Callie.
[00:30:58] And he said that Callie had been kicked out or failed.
[00:31:05] He'd failed off your candidate school three times.
[00:31:08] And they just wanted to hey, we need more of guys.
[00:31:11] We need to have better numbers getting through, go ahead and pass the guy.
[00:31:14] So you got a guy that lacks leadership.
[00:31:16] And it is, I mean it's interesting to talk about how bland this guy is.
[00:31:20] I mean, somebody that's that bland that they literally have nothing no characteristics.
[00:31:24] Obviously the guy lacks some leadership characteristics.
[00:31:27] Well, because he has no characteristics.
[00:31:30] And now you got the young soldiers looking at the guy and thinking he doesn't have, he doesn't
[00:31:34] have any leadership.
[00:31:37] And this is a part that I highlighted because I think it's an interesting perspective
[00:31:43] of what it was like to go to Vietnam.
[00:31:46] Back to the book, we flew over on a continental airlines plane.
[00:31:51] Fred Wittmeyer recalls, it was a weird situation, a civilian plane with a civilian
[00:31:56] student and crew.
[00:31:58] They were flying both ways.
[00:32:00] They were flying people out as well as in, so they got to see both ends.
[00:32:05] I remember getting off the plane and the student just stood there crying as we unloaded.
[00:32:10] They were more attuned to what we were getting into than we were.
[00:32:18] That's pretty surreal.
[00:32:22] Now they start talking about what it's like there and what they're doing.
[00:32:33] And there's a province there that they're starting to concentrate on a province in Vietnam
[00:32:41] and some of the problems that they have there.
[00:32:43] In a province deemed correctly to be overwhelmingly sympathetic to the Vietnam this meant
[00:32:47] eliminating the countryside.
[00:32:49] The villages were bombed, burned down, and polarized.
[00:32:53] Sometimes villagers would be warned advance that their homes were about to be wiped off
[00:32:57] the face of the earth.
[00:32:59] Sometimes not.
[00:33:01] It was common practice to shell or bomb any village from which the US soldiers had taken
[00:33:06] any fire even small arms without any warning at all.
[00:33:11] The destruction was almost unimaginable scale.
[00:33:15] So again, was this something that in the wars that I thought and that we would never do
[00:33:21] that.
[00:33:22] It wasn't just like, oh we took rifle fire from a village bomb the whole thing.
[00:33:25] That was not happening.
[00:33:29] This was the reality behind Westmoreland's prediction in 1965 that the war will bring
[00:33:34] about a moment of decision for the peasant farmer.
[00:33:38] He will have to choose if he stays alive.
[00:33:42] American officials frequently referred to this choice.
[00:33:45] The choice's yours, one leaflet, dropped on villages proclaimed.
[00:33:49] If you refuse to let Viet Kong use your villages and hamlets as their battlefield, your
[00:33:54] homes and lives will be spared.
[00:33:57] A million leaflets a day were being dropped on quining province, quying nigh province
[00:34:04] at this time.
[00:34:05] The whole exercise assumed that the largely illiterate peasants could actually read them.
[00:34:12] From 1965 to 1972, 50 billion leaflets were dropped over Viet Nama, 1500 each for every member
[00:34:21] of the population.
[00:34:24] So that's just, when you think about dropping these leaflets to tell people what to do
[00:34:30] and most of the popular or a lot of the population is illiterate.
[00:34:34] Hey get out of your village.
[00:34:35] Well there's a piece of paper flying from the sky and I don't know what it says.
[00:34:41] Back to the book, to stay and be killed or to go join thousands of other refugees in the
[00:34:45] squalor of refugee camps or the mushrooming shanty towns around the towns and cities.
[00:34:50] What kind of a choice was this?
[00:34:54] But for the Americans, the whole point of clearing an area of countryside of its people was
[00:35:00] so that anyone who remained must be Viet Kong.
[00:35:04] These areas became free fire zones.
[00:35:06] Anything that happened to someone who chose to remain in or return to a free fire zone
[00:35:11] was their own fault.
[00:35:13] They could expect the worst.
[00:35:15] The belief that people had been given a chance to get out had made their choice, made
[00:35:20] the strategy morally workable.
[00:35:22] In a free fire zone, the pursuit of a high body count could proceed unencumbered by the
[00:35:28] need to discriminate between combatants and civilians at all.
[00:35:35] No where was this breathtaking carelessness of human life greater than in Quang Nai?
[00:35:43] No one was actually saying kill civilians but no one strived to keep them alive because
[00:35:48] the killing of civilians came to be seen as unavoidable less and less time was spent on seeing
[00:35:53] how it could be avoided.
[00:35:55] To American spokesman, the death or injury of non-combatants was always accidental and
[00:36:01] inevitable tragedy of war and therefore somehow uncorrectable.
[00:36:14] It doesn't take a genius to figure this out.
[00:36:17] When the Americans are bombing your village and they're killing your son, your husband,
[00:36:23] your wife, whatever.
[00:36:24] I mean, who side are you going to be on?
[00:36:28] And we know that the VC were brutal.
[00:36:31] Look at the end of Petun Commander when the VC come in and murder the half the village
[00:36:36] or three quarters of the village and burn down their hots and blow up all their hooches.
[00:36:40] We know that the VC were capable and evil but when our strategy is hey, give them a quick
[00:36:51] warning, drop some leaflets tell them if they stay there, they're VC and if not, hey,
[00:36:56] we gave them a chance so if they're standing there, they must be VC.
[00:37:03] Charlie Company spent December guarding bridges and practicing in the deserted village
[00:37:07] of Duke foe, the army called it in-country orientation and Australian adviser was brought
[00:37:15] into instruct the company on how to distinguish between non-compatants, the at-combatants,
[00:37:19] regular suspects and sympathizers.
[00:37:22] He said it was very difficult, so did other instructors from the South Vietnamese army.
[00:37:29] They got the same story from former Viet Kong, the Australian emphasized that you should
[00:37:36] be extremely leery of children, Medina testified later, Medina is the company commander
[00:37:42] so the company has three petunes in it, but overall in charge of the company's guy named
[00:37:46] Medina.
[00:37:47] Now think about this, not only you're just distinguishing between good and bad, you've got
[00:37:53] non-combatants which are friendly civilians, Viet Kong regulars, suspects and sympathizers.
[00:38:00] Now you've got the Vietnamese soldiers who are from Vietnam obviously, they're saying how hard
[00:38:06] it is to distinguish Khusu and then the Viet Kong captured Viet Kong themselves are saying
[00:38:13] that it's very difficult to know who's who.
[00:38:16] So how is a kid from Iowa going to be able to tell the difference?
[00:38:27] You were exposed to something that went far beyond the world as we knew it, said Fred
[00:38:32] Windmere.
[00:38:33] We had just left Hawaii with all the totels, nightclubs and bars and we wound up in
[00:38:38] Vietnam where people went right out and shit in the rice paddy in the morning, dropped
[00:38:43] their drawers right along the trail at any time.
[00:38:45] It was hard to consider people in the modern day and age living like they did.
[00:38:51] I think it went against our value of what human life is.
[00:38:57] Valley was always frustrated and is attempts to keep the children away from his men when
[00:39:02] they were guarding bridges at Duckfo.
[00:39:06] All the men love them, gave the kids candies, cookies, chewing gum, everything he said later,
[00:39:12] not me, I hated them.
[00:39:15] I was afraid of the Vietnamese kids.
[00:39:19] So you know you got the Australian guys saying hey look, be leery of the kids.
[00:39:22] You got the kid from Iowa, the normal American grunt, he loves the kids, he's given
[00:39:27] them gum, he's given them food, playing with them, it's all good.
[00:39:31] Meanwhile, Kali again, you start seeing the indicators of what's about to take place.
[00:39:36] You got a guy that's saying I hated them.
[00:39:39] I hated them.
[00:39:42] It's hard to develop hatred for a kid, for a five year old.
[00:39:51] Now they become part of a unit that's called Task Force Barker, which is multiple companies
[00:40:02] of which Charlie company is one of them.
[00:40:04] And this Lieutenant Colonel, like the Italian commander, he is the commander of this
[00:40:10] task force and actually his name is Colonel Frank Barker.
[00:40:12] So they named the task force after him and they send them up to this province.
[00:40:19] Now, inside their back to the book, inside their fire bases, men of the task force enjoyed
[00:40:27] as much of the American world as could be flown in by helicopter.
[00:40:31] They received their mail, American newspapers, cold beers, stakes, ice cream, Coca-Cola,
[00:40:38] and playboy magazine.
[00:40:40] But all around them was the world of the Viet Kong.
[00:40:45] And I got another interesting thing from this book just to show the extent that they did
[00:40:52] this.
[00:40:54] There was 40 ice cream plants built in Vietnam to supply the troops with ice cream.
[00:41:03] And each another figure that I read was that each person in each soldier in Vietnam used
[00:41:11] 100 pounds to supplies a day crazy.
[00:41:20] Now the guys, they move into this new province, province, quang-ni, and they start to
[00:41:31] encounter some combat.
[00:41:34] And I'm very careful to say they're not encountering, they're not really encountering
[00:41:38] VC, they're not getting in a bunch of fire flights, but they are getting in some.
[00:41:43] And this is there, they're in their first fire flight, and here we go, back to the book,
[00:41:47] the men in their first fire flight were discovering things about each other and about themselves.
[00:41:53] Greg Olson recalled, we were pinned down in a trench taking a lot of fire.
[00:41:57] Sergeant Cowan was on one side.
[00:42:00] One side of me putting up his helmet to get some bullet holes in it.
[00:42:03] Almost like it was amusing.
[00:42:05] On the other side, there was this other guy just sobbing, he'd come on glued, crawling
[00:42:10] around like a dog, just lost it.
[00:42:14] The first puttune with Jew under cover of massive artillery bombardment, according to some
[00:42:19] of the men, Cowan was totally lost.
[00:42:23] He led them back towards the river, as they broke cover the snipers started up again.
[00:42:28] On Weber, Cowan's radio operator took a shot with shattered his radio set and tore his kidney out.
[00:42:36] He died a few moments later, Charlie company's first killed in action.
[00:42:41] His horrified companions lifted him onto the hovering Metavac helicopter.
[00:42:46] A GI and shock bluvered and howled, no one had known much about shock before.
[00:42:52] If we got hit much harder, we would all go into shock, Cowan told his court martial
[00:42:56] nearly three years later.
[00:42:58] It was terrifying, terrifying experience.
[00:43:03] In later years, Cowan admitted that he'd been careless.
[00:43:06] He'd led his men into an exposed position, so they'd had to fire fight and they're trying
[00:43:11] to break contact and Cowan leads him out into an open area and gets one of his guys killed.
[00:43:18] And then he asked to report back, he got to fire fight, okay, how to go, let's report
[00:43:23] back, what's the body count?
[00:43:26] Is that remember this is all about killing, is all about killing.
[00:43:31] And so he passes up the body count and here's how he comes up with his body count.
[00:43:36] As later, how he arrived at a body count, Cowan replied, you just make an estimate off
[00:43:42] the top of your head.
[00:43:44] There is no way to really figure out exact body count as long as it was high, that's all
[00:43:49] they wanted.
[00:43:50] I generally knew that if I lost a troop, I'd better come back with a body count of
[00:43:55] 10, say I shot at least 10 of the enemy, which was pretty hard when you're only fighting
[00:44:00] a one sniper.
[00:44:03] So you got these guys out in the field and they're reported, they're just making up the
[00:44:06] body count.
[00:44:07] Now think about what the fact this has on the war effort, because General Westmoreland's
[00:44:12] up there saying, hey, we're going to kill him until they can't take it anymore.
[00:44:15] Well, guess how many people they killed right there, zero, they didn't kill that sniper.
[00:44:20] And yet they're reporting that they killed 10.
[00:44:23] Well, you multiply that over the whole country and every unit that's out there that's making
[00:44:28] up these body count numbers.
[00:44:29] And guess what, eventually, Westmoreland thinks we're doing a good job in killing a lot
[00:44:33] of bad guys, but we're not killing any.
[00:44:37] And I can jam you up when you have that, even in a different type of scenario where you're
[00:44:42] getting a report on a certain level of progress.
[00:44:46] And therefore, a lot of times the decision, the next decisions to be made are based on that.
[00:44:50] 100% any situation that you're in, if you've got your troopers and your subordinate
[00:44:57] leadership with the mindset that they would rather lie to you than tell you the truth about
[00:45:02] what's happening, you're never going to be able to make good decisions, because you're
[00:45:05] making your decisions based on lies.
[00:45:06] Yep.
[00:45:07] Yeah.
[00:45:08] Back to the book, frustration and anger aid away at the company's as speed accord.
[00:45:17] The men stopped believing that Charlie CONG, meaning the vehicle was afraid of Charlie
[00:45:22] Company.
[00:45:23] Faith in Medina, the company commander, was still high, although some G.I.s felt he pushed
[00:45:27] the company too hard.
[00:45:30] Cally was another matter.
[00:45:32] A pinion on him was universally hostile, according to one G.I. and his patoon, Cally was
[00:45:38] a glory hungry person, the kind of person who would have sacrificed all of us for his own
[00:45:43] personal advancement.
[00:45:45] On Smeil, a squad leader in third platoon called him a nervous, excitable type who yelled
[00:45:51] a lot.
[00:45:53] I think it's important for you to know, Smeil told Army CID, that Cally was so disliked by members
[00:46:00] of the unit that they put a bounty on his head.
[00:46:03] None of the men had any respect for him as a military leader.
[00:46:07] Greg Olson thought he was incompetent.
[00:46:09] I remember instances that we were lost one time at night, everyone knew we were lost, but
[00:46:14] Cally wouldn't admit it.
[00:46:18] So there you go, you got a guy.
[00:46:20] We talked about this all the time and say, what do you do if you make a mistake?
[00:46:23] You own the mistake.
[00:46:25] If you need help, you say, hey, you know what?
[00:46:26] I'm not sure we're on the map right now.
[00:46:28] Let me get someone up here to do a map study.
[00:46:30] Help me out.
[00:46:31] Let's figure out where we are.
[00:46:32] But instead, he just lies.
[00:46:34] He doesn't admit it.
[00:46:35] He doesn't own it.
[00:46:37] And no one is going to have respect for him.
[00:46:41] Back to the book.
[00:46:42] I thought Cally acted like a small guy who had been pushed around a lot by bigger people
[00:46:47] before he joined the army.
[00:46:49] Now that he had authority, he didn't know how to use it.
[00:46:51] And he didn't listen to suggestions.
[00:46:55] I talk about this all the time.
[00:46:58] If you're in a leadership position, you need to listen to your people.
[00:47:01] Up and down the chain of command.
[00:47:02] That's one of the main things that he's getting called out on.
[00:47:05] Doesn't admit what he's wrong.
[00:47:06] And doesn't listen to suggestions.
[00:47:09] Many commented that there was something about him that rubbed people the wrong way.
[00:47:13] Medina, the company commander, gave his junior lieutenant a tough time and ridiculed him
[00:47:17] in front of his men.
[00:47:20] The captain called him, Lieutenant Shithead regularly.
[00:47:24] One G.I. remembered, that tended to minimize your opinion of him.
[00:47:28] Other recalled, others recalled that Cally's attempt to win favor with Medina were frequently
[00:47:33] rebuffed with a sarcastic, listen sweetheart.
[00:47:37] So now we have another situation where you have a subordinate leader that's not doing a good
[00:47:42] job.
[00:47:43] He's not being a good leader.
[00:47:45] People don't respect him.
[00:47:46] And what is his superior doing?
[00:47:48] Undermining him in front of his troops instead of counseling him and said, I helped
[00:47:51] him and said, pulling him aside and say, hey, it's okay to admit when you're wrong.
[00:47:54] Hey, you need to take suggestions from your guys.
[00:47:57] Instead he's calling him a shithead, lieutenant shithead, undermining him all the time.
[00:48:01] So now you get put in Cally, and you even worse position.
[00:48:06] Now, they continue to patrol.
[00:48:13] They're starting to take some casualties and they start to go down the spiral.
[00:48:20] Back to the book.
[00:48:21] Charlie company's drift toward brutality took very little time.
[00:48:25] It began with beating up suspects and villages and quickly became more serious.
[00:48:31] Burn heart state of luft from the process Fred Widdmeer did not.
[00:48:36] It explained that Geneva Convention Toss turning our training and in the beginning we did
[00:48:40] what we thought was right and just turned the prisoners over.
[00:48:44] But it was kind of hard after you'd been there a while and you started seeing, learning,
[00:48:48] finding out what real experience is all about.
[00:48:53] Here you are fighting an enemy who doesn't follow the Geneva Convention, but you have to
[00:48:57] abide by it.
[00:48:58] It's like being in a football team where you have to follow the rules to the letter and
[00:49:03] the other team can do whatever the hell they like.
[00:49:06] The voices of authority in the company, the platoon sergeants and officers acknowledge that
[00:49:11] this executing prisoners was a proper way to behave.
[00:49:17] Who would have grunts to disagree with it?
[00:49:19] We supported it.
[00:49:23] They've started to execute prisoners, which is obviously against the Geneva Convention,
[00:49:28] but the way they're looking at it, they're seeing that the sergeants and the platoon commanders
[00:49:32] are like okay with it.
[00:49:34] So the grunts are okay, I guess that's the way it's going to be.
[00:49:40] And we'd mere goes on to say, the first time I saw something really bad was the point
[00:49:45] at which we stopped taking prisoners.
[00:49:48] We'd been there about a month and a half or maybe two months.
[00:49:51] There was one guy Medina had shoot the prisoners.
[00:49:54] Instead of having everyone around and shoot them, we would walk them down towards the
[00:49:58] they would walk them down towards the beach or behind some sand dunes and shoot them.
[00:50:03] A couple of shots and they were done.
[00:50:06] As time went by, things were done.
[00:50:08] Ears cut off mutilation.
[00:50:11] One prisoner had his arms tied straight out on a stick.
[00:50:15] One woman was a woman and one was a man.
[00:50:19] There was no question that these two were via Kong.
[00:50:22] The woman was working as a nurse and we found them in a tunnel with all the medical supplies
[00:50:26] and we knew they were the enemy.
[00:50:29] At cigarettes were put inside the elastic of the guy's pants and we watched him dance
[00:50:34] around because they were burning his ass.
[00:50:38] I think it was a bit of making him talk and a bit of venting our frustrations, a bit
[00:50:42] of both.
[00:50:43] I don't remember what happened to them whether they were turned over or shot.
[00:50:49] The more it went on, the more you didn't trust anyone.
[00:50:52] You didn't believe anybody because you didn't know who is, who you didn't know who the
[00:50:56] enemy was.
[00:50:58] As we went on, more and more prisoners would be executed.
[00:51:04] I would say it was a regular occurrence.
[00:51:06] I did abuse someone, a prisoner, a pop-as-on.
[00:51:10] I found myself doing the same things that had been going on all along.
[00:51:14] I found myself caught up in it.
[00:51:16] We caught his beard off.
[00:51:17] That was an insult.
[00:51:19] A pop-as-on with a beard is considered as the wise man and to caught off their beard
[00:51:22] who's a real sign of disrespect to them.
[00:51:25] You found yourself punching them around, beating them up, trying to get them to talk.
[00:51:30] I never did head anyone with a rifle.
[00:51:33] I've taken a knife to them.
[00:51:35] I never tortured anyone to death.
[00:51:37] I think I probably saw people tortured to death.
[00:51:41] So you hear this guy using this verbiage, you find yourself punching them around.
[00:51:45] It's almost as if it's not him.
[00:51:46] He's detached.
[00:51:48] Right, we talked about being detached.
[00:51:50] Well, he's detached from doing something that he knows he shouldn't be doing.
[00:51:53] Yeah, it seems like he comes back and checks back in every once in a while.
[00:51:57] Like, dang, I've got to woke up and found myself doing this thing.
[00:52:01] Burnheart, and outsider is usual.
[00:52:04] Watch the downward spiral.
[00:52:06] It started with just plain prisoners.
[00:52:09] Prisoners you thought were the enemy.
[00:52:11] Then you'd go on to prisoners who weren't the enemy.
[00:52:14] And then the civilians because there was no difference between the enemy and civilians.
[00:52:19] It came to a point where a guy could kill anybody.
[00:52:24] During an interrogation in one very village, Harry Stanley was standing only 10 feet away
[00:52:29] while the Cali and another GI Herbert Carter interrogated an old farmer.
[00:52:35] We attended Cali asked some questions and then Carter hit the old man in the mouth twice
[00:52:39] with his fist.
[00:52:40] Then Carter pushed the old man into a well, but the old man spread his legs and arms
[00:52:45] and held on and didn't fall into the well.
[00:52:48] In Carter hit the old man in the stomach with his rifle stock.
[00:52:51] The old man fell, the old man's feet fell into the well, but he was holding on with his hands.
[00:52:56] Carter hit the man's fingers trying to make him fall into the well.
[00:53:00] Then Lieutenant Cali shot the man in the Xen 16.
[00:53:07] For some GI's instance, like these showed that the official attitude to brutality was
[00:53:12] permissive.
[00:53:13] The result was a moral vacuum, a moratorium on restraint and self-control.
[00:53:19] Common decency became optional, a matter of personal inclination.
[00:53:25] Even those who refused to be drawn in were left morally thrown off balance.
[00:53:30] Greg Olson was in the village when Cali and Carter threw the old man down the well.
[00:53:36] I was in the village.
[00:53:37] I remember seeing people butted in the head with rifles, but you start losing your
[00:53:41] sense of what's normal.
[00:53:43] You don't give up your morals but you become a lot more tolerant.
[00:53:47] We believe this behavior was pretty commonplace.
[00:53:50] I didn't think we were doing anything different from any other unit.
[00:53:53] You really do lose your sense, not of right and wrong, but your degree of white right
[00:53:59] and wrong.
[00:54:02] And Michael Bernhardt, who watched what was happening from the sidelines, was already viewed
[00:54:07] with some mistrust by Medina, Cali and others in the company.
[00:54:13] When I saw American soldiers committing acts that could be called atrocities if someone
[00:54:17] else had done them, I began to think that maybe I'd just been too naive all my life
[00:54:21] that this is the way things really were.
[00:54:24] Little by little, I began to see that this group of men was getting out of control.
[00:54:30] Discipline was beginning to wear off.
[00:54:31] Without military discipline, they were alone in the country with no point of reference.
[00:54:37] The things they had brought from their families and schools were far away in beginning
[00:54:41] to disappear.
[00:54:45] Fred Woodmer, Fred Woodmer II felt things going from bad to worse and felt himself drawn
[00:54:51] along with the retired.
[00:54:54] If it ever occurred to me that things were getting out of hand or that I was questioning
[00:54:57] what, I myself might be capable of doing, I suppressed it.
[00:55:01] It did creep up in my mind because you still have those values of what is right and what
[00:55:05] is wrong that you have been taught all your life.
[00:55:09] I think the frustration got to me, but I also think I began to enjoy it.
[00:55:14] That's what's scary because at the time you find yourself enjoying it.
[00:55:19] I guess you could term it the superiority we had over them.
[00:55:23] It's a strange feeling.
[00:55:24] In retrospect, you look back on it and wonder how you yourself could have done it.
[00:55:30] 20 years later, when you look back at things that happened, things that transpired, things
[00:55:34] you did, you say, why?
[00:55:36] Why did I do that?
[00:55:38] That is not me.
[00:55:40] Something happened to me.
[00:55:42] You reach a point over there where you snap.
[00:55:45] That's the easiest way to put it.
[00:55:46] You finally snap.
[00:55:49] Somebody flicks a switch and you are a completely different person.
[00:55:53] There's a culture of violence, of brutality with people all around you doing the same thing.
[00:56:04] Continuing down the spiral, Leonard Gonzalez, a member of Second Paltune saw rapes,
[00:56:13] committed every time the company went through a village.
[00:56:19] One squad got one girl, one lady.
[00:56:23] Then they told me, go in there and I said no, I won't.
[00:56:26] So what I did is I went inside and she looked real bad.
[00:56:31] The only thing I can do for the lady is like, I got the canteen and I wiped her.
[00:56:36] She was awful for spiring.
[00:56:37] I wiped her forehead.
[00:56:39] I tried to help her.
[00:56:40] She got scared of me.
[00:56:41] I was part of them.
[00:56:43] I tried to tell her I don't have nothing to do with it.
[00:56:45] I helped her to her feet.
[00:56:47] I took her to the well.
[00:56:48] I got some water from the well.
[00:56:51] Then another squad heard about 13 guys who did their thing with this woman.
[00:56:57] And we're going to try her out and I told them to leave her alone.
[00:57:01] And then at that time I just walked off.
[00:57:03] I said, forget it.
[00:57:05] I don't want to kill my own men.
[00:57:08] I tried to tell her, get out of here.
[00:57:10] Go.
[00:57:12] She was going to run.
[00:57:14] But after 13 guys got to her, it's hard to walk.
[00:57:28] They're losing it.
[00:57:31] There's no leadership.
[00:57:33] They're losing it.
[00:57:40] Now they get into a, they get in a mine field.
[00:57:47] And they take some casualties in a mine field.
[00:57:49] And here's Madena's account of what happened in this mine field.
[00:57:54] We started sweeping the area as best we could with mine detectors taking pieces of toy
[00:57:58] that paper and marking the minds that we found.
[00:58:02] We had one individual that we could not evacuate that was dead.
[00:58:05] I took the medic that was with me, the platoon medic from first platoon.
[00:58:09] But he and I moved through the mine field to where an individual was lying.
[00:58:13] He was split as if somebody had taken a cleaver and right up from his crotch all the way up
[00:58:17] to his chest cavity.
[00:58:19] I had never seen anything like it that looked so unreal in my entire life.
[00:58:23] The intestines, the liver and the stomach and the blood just looked like plastic.
[00:58:28] We took a poncho and we spread it out and started and the medic started to pick
[00:58:33] them up by the legs.
[00:58:35] I reached underneath his arms to place him under the poncho and we set him on top of
[00:58:39] another mine.
[00:58:41] The concussion blew me back.
[00:58:43] I fell backward as I got up the medic was starting to go to pieces.
[00:58:49] I looked at him as if he had stood behind the screen and somebody had taken a paintbrush
[00:58:55] with red paint and splattered it through the screen.
[00:58:58] He had blood all over him.
[00:59:00] I grabbed him as he started to pass me and I shook him and I said, my god don't go to pieces
[00:59:04] on me.
[00:59:05] You're the only medic I've got.
[00:59:07] I have these people that are hurt.
[00:59:09] I hit him.
[00:59:11] I slapped him.
[00:59:12] I knocked him to the ground and I helped him to get back up and I saw on his religious
[00:59:17] metal a piece of liver and I tried to get it off the individual before he seen it.
[00:59:24] The individual was very shook up.
[00:59:29] Everybody was shaken.
[00:59:30] Three men were dead.
[00:59:31] Another 12 suffered ghastly injuries.
[00:59:34] If you could forget their own fear or the screams of the wounded or the gruesome task of
[00:59:39] loading the Medevac helicopters.
[00:59:43] When you've been through a minefield and put the remains of your friends and body bags,
[00:59:47] nothing shocks you anymore.
[00:59:51] So that minefield caused some three dead and 12 severely wounded.
[01:00:00] We talked about IEDs a lot in here.
[01:00:02] We talked about him with Jodi, Jodi Medek who got blown up by an IED.
[01:00:08] There's no one to fight.
[01:00:10] The bomb goes off and that's it.
[01:00:14] Who did this?
[01:00:16] Who do you blame?
[01:00:18] Well let me answer that question for these guys.
[01:00:21] Most of all they blamed the Vietnamese.
[01:00:24] Not the Vietnam who they could not see or find but the Vietnamese and the villages who did
[01:00:29] not warn them of the minefields and of the booby traps.
[01:00:32] Same thing my school teacher told me.
[01:00:35] They're starting to apply the blame to these Vietnamese villagers.
[01:00:44] Lieutenant Callie noticed the change in the mood of the men.
[01:00:50] He had been on leave at the time of the incident.
[01:00:52] So he wasn't around when this happened.
[01:00:56] He had been on leave at the time of the incident and had returned the LZ uptight and
[01:01:00] time to meet the helicopters fearing the dead and injured.
[01:01:04] From now on the men in his platoon no longer gave candy to the Vietnamese children.
[01:01:10] They came across while on patrol and the villages.
[01:01:13] Instead Callie noticed with some saddest faction.
[01:01:17] They kicked everybody aside, even the nice sweet kids.
[01:01:21] He could hardly refrain from telling them, well I told you so.
[01:01:26] Now they are starting to, after that incident, they're starting to now assemble information
[01:01:40] and intelligence for this raid that they're planning in Mely.
[01:01:48] And I think it's really important to take a look at where this intelligence is coming from
[01:01:53] and how this, because it paints a very important part of the picture of what these guys
[01:01:57] are being told back to the book.
[01:02:00] In intelligence round up for March 1968, prepared respectively, summed up the state of knowledge
[01:02:06] was this.
[01:02:08] Although, Sontin district remained relatively quiet during this period, elements of the 48th
[01:02:14] and existing local force units probably roamed the district countryside.
[01:02:21] The hills north and northwest of Mely area were probable base camps for elements of the 48th
[01:02:30] battalion.
[01:02:31] And it probably received supplies from the peninsula.
[01:02:38] So the 48th is an enemy unit, an enemy battalion.
[01:02:45] And you can hear the word probable being used.
[01:02:48] Okay, they're probably in the area, the villagers probably support them.
[01:02:51] So there isn't a claim being made from higher from above the chain of command.
[01:02:58] But you're going to hear that change.
[01:03:00] So above the chain of command, there's higher intelligence sets making these claims that
[01:03:06] there's probable VC there that they're probably working this area that they're probably
[01:03:09] getting supported from the villages.
[01:03:10] Well, as this filters down, it turns from probable to like definite.
[01:03:19] There is a strange discrepancy between what the army thought it knew about the vehicle
[01:03:24] and what the task force thought it knew.
[01:03:28] Army intelligence made only tentative claims.
[01:03:31] By contrast, Ram's Dell and for that matter, Kutak were almost pontificals.
[01:03:37] So these are the two intelligence guys at the task force level.
[01:03:42] So does that make sense?
[01:03:43] So you've got the higher army above them is telling them, hey, there's probably this
[01:03:47] problem that.
[01:03:48] And these guys are basically starting to say, no, no, this is VC.
[01:03:51] This is what this is.
[01:03:52] What's happening?
[01:03:53] Factually.
[01:03:54] Is that kind of like the game of telephone one of those?
[01:03:58] Yeah, it is.
[01:03:59] And it's also you're going to find as I go into this that both these guys aren't experienced.
[01:04:05] So I'll get to it.
[01:04:07] It was a kind of perverse destiny that brought the two overweight and middle-aged American
[01:04:11] captains, Ram's Dell and Kutak together in TET Kwang Nye City.
[01:04:18] Both were new boys to the real world of intelligence assessment in a battle zone.
[01:04:23] Both were inexperienced to both desperately eager to establish a reputation.
[01:04:29] Ram's Dell had provided to intelligence and Kutak prior to me, lie, operation and the
[01:04:34] curious convergence of their views irresistibly suggests that it was indeed Ram's Dell who
[01:04:41] provided intelligence for the attack on me, lie itself.
[01:04:46] Suggestions at the 48th local force betimes up to 400 strong that everyone in the village
[01:04:51] was Viet Kwang or Viet Kwang sympathizer.
[01:04:54] And that at seven on Saturday morning all bonafide civilians would have left the village
[01:04:58] for the market.
[01:04:59] All these views were shared by Ram's Dell and Kutak and accepted uncritically by Task Force
[01:05:05] Barker.
[01:05:06] So think about that.
[01:05:07] You got these guys saying there's 400 up to 400 enemy in the area that the village is
[01:05:15] all Viet Kwang sympathizers and that on a Saturday, everyone that's our actual civilian
[01:05:23] will have left at seven o'clock in the morning for the market.
[01:05:25] Now you can't make that claim about any group of civilians in the world that everyone's
[01:05:29] going to do something at the same time.
[01:05:33] Impossible that you could make that claim.
[01:05:38] Back to the book, ask later about intelligence indicating that no civilians would be left
[01:05:42] in the village at the time of the attack.
[01:05:43] Ram's Dell replied that the civilians went to market early in the morning because of the
[01:05:47] heat.
[01:05:50] They testified and appears in a similar vein in the civilian market.
[01:05:54] In a civilian population area there were several markets large markets where all the people
[01:05:58] would gather each day because they had no refrigeration or anything like it.
[01:06:04] With hindsight it appears naive even simple minded.
[01:06:08] Yet in 1968 this nugget of anthropological insight along with the corollary that everyone
[01:06:14] who was not at the market was Viet Kwang was deemed unchallengeable by Ram's Dell.
[01:06:20] It was ordered impeccable by Kutak and passed on unamended to the bitter men of Charlie
[01:06:25] Company seeking revenge for their losses.
[01:06:29] This is just a horrible situation.
[01:06:31] It's a horrible situation.
[01:06:32] I had situations like that occur with me where it was early my first deployment to Iraq
[01:06:41] where we got almost like a movie.
[01:06:44] We would get maps of a city area and there would be a red X on the target building.
[01:06:50] You're bad guys in this building.
[01:06:52] And I remember one time we went out we hit the building with the red X on it and we
[01:06:57] didn't find anything or it wasn't only or the people that we got out of there turned
[01:07:02] out to be not the person we were looking for and as we did further analysis we realized
[01:07:07] that the building was the wrong building.
[01:07:10] And after that I got very critical about okay who put the red X on this building.
[01:07:16] Tell me who did that and why they did it.
[01:07:18] I want to know I'm not just going off of you put a red X on a building doesn't mean anything
[01:07:21] to me.
[01:07:22] I want to know who did that and I had another situation where we went and hit a building
[01:07:30] where there was suspected bad guy we had intelligence on the sky was a finance year
[01:07:34] and had money and was given it to the insurgents and so we went and captured them and
[01:07:39] searched his house and you know blew his door off so we we caused impact to his house.
[01:07:48] And then when we got him back we after we talked to him we figured out this guy was not
[01:07:52] bad.
[01:07:53] And as I pulled the string on where the intelligence came from that eventually led
[01:07:59] somebody to put a red X on his house and described the guy and who he was I found out
[01:08:03] that it was actually he the guy owned a business and he had fired one of his employees
[01:08:08] and when he fired one of his employees well his employee went told the Americans hey
[01:08:13] this guy's a bad guy this guy's funding you know insurgents got a little disgruntled
[01:08:19] so all you had to do is dig in and find a little bit more about the information and you
[01:08:23] figured out it was a disgruntled employee so guys out there in the field right now when
[01:08:27] you're always questioning your intelligence nothing against the intelligence folks
[01:08:30] they're going to do the best they can but they're not the ones that are going to get
[01:08:32] the blood on their hands.
[01:08:34] So question the intelligence find out what the sources are find out where the information
[01:08:38] came from ask who drew that red X ask who said there's not going to be any villagers
[01:08:43] in the in the no civilians in the village after seven o'clock in the morning ask those
[01:08:48] questions.
[01:08:53] Meanwhile the losses these guys are continue to take casualties so they took was it
[01:08:59] three killed and twelve wounded and now they got sergeant Cox killed by a booby
[01:09:04] trap they got a dice and lost both legs Hendrickson's blinded suffered growing injuries
[01:09:10] and lost an arm in a leg.
[01:09:12] So there's continuing to take casualties and on top of the casualties that they're taking
[01:09:18] you're starting to get an escalation of behavior of negative behavior and here's an example
[01:09:23] of that back to the book a village you're passing on a bicycle was beaten up but managed
[01:09:27] to escape a woman working in the fields was shot when somebody shouted that she was
[01:09:31] carrying a weapon when the squad came closer they discovered she was unarmed and still alive
[01:09:38] they shot her again and kicked her body to a pulp somebody stole her ring.
[01:09:45] They were now close to their base and angry villagers stormed the camp and protest against
[01:09:50] the murder.
[01:09:51] Medina managed to hush it up no one was charged with any offense.
[01:09:55] Medina said later that the woman had been discovered with a detonator still in her hand.
[01:10:01] Kelly commented that Medina wasn't about to lose men just because they kicked a Vietnamese
[01:10:06] kid or killed a damn innocent woman he had to keep a combat effective unit.
[01:10:12] So now you've got clear cover up going on by the chain of command.
[01:10:16] Hey she had a detonator she now a detonator and it's very visible to see this downward
[01:10:24] spiral from a letter from Greg Olson who like I said he was the faithful Mormon kid and
[01:10:36] he writes a letter to his dad back in the States dear dad how's everything with you?
[01:10:40] I'm still here on the bridge we leave Saturday one of our platoons went out on a routine
[01:10:45] patrol today and came across a hundred and fifty five millimeter artillery round that
[01:10:49] was booby trap.
[01:10:51] They killed one man, boove the legs off two others and injured two more and it all turned
[01:10:57] out a bad day made even worse on their way back to to Doddy which is their the name
[01:11:03] of their camp.
[01:11:04] They saw woman working in the fields.
[01:11:07] They shot and wounded her then they kicked her to death and empty their magazines in
[01:11:11] her head.
[01:11:12] They slugged every little kid they came across wine gods named as this half to happen.
[01:11:18] They're all seemingly normal guys some were friends of mine for a while.
[01:11:25] They were wild like animals.
[01:11:28] It was murder and I'm ashamed of myself for not trying to do anything about it.
[01:11:32] This isn't the first time dad I've seen it many times before I don't know why I'm telling
[01:11:36] you this I guess I just want to get it all off my chest.
[01:11:40] My faith in fellow man is all shot to hell.
[01:11:44] I just want my time to pass and I just want to come home.
[01:11:47] I really believe as you do dad there's a cause behind all this and if it is God's will
[01:11:52] for me to go I would rather do it here than home on a freeway.
[01:11:58] Saturday we're going to be dropped by air in an NVA stronghold.
[01:12:03] I'm hoping I'll be able to get out of here for a few days to go to a conference.
[01:12:08] Don't expect any letters for me for a while but please keep writing them.
[01:12:12] I love and miss you and mom so much your son Greg.
[01:12:21] Again highlighted in there the normality of the guys and how they're starting to slide
[01:12:27] the clear it's obvious to Greg Olson that what's happening is wrong.
[01:12:33] And unfortunately he's not stepping up and saying anything he's not bringing it to the
[01:12:37] intention of anyone he's letting it happen.
[01:12:42] Back to the book with these most recent losses Charlie company was down to 105 men.
[01:12:48] Since arriving in Vietnam three months before they had suffered 28 casualties including
[01:12:52] five killed three of them in action.
[01:12:55] All the casualties come from mines, booby traps and snipers.
[01:13:01] They had never seen or encountered the enemy in any strength.
[01:13:06] Their had been no heavy contact.
[01:13:08] They were battle scarred without being battle hardened.
[01:13:17] So you can imagine again it's what my what's what my high school teacher told me.
[01:13:23] They're they're viewing.
[01:13:24] They're taking these casualties and it's very similar to Iraq and Afghanistan where I think
[01:13:28] in Iraq it was 75% of the casualties are from IEDs.
[01:13:33] There's no one to shoot at after an IED blows up oftentimes is nothing to shoot at.
[01:13:40] Now with those casualties with that viewpoint they're starting to prepare as I said
[01:13:49] for this this assault on me lie.
[01:13:54] And back to the book although no written record of the briefing survives the witnesses
[01:13:59] all agree on the general thrust of coup tax contribution this is the intelligence officer.
[01:14:04] The 48th LF battalion was dispersed throughout the area.
[01:14:09] But the latest intelligence the assembled officers were told suggested that VC headquarters
[01:14:14] and two companies totaling over 200 fighting men were located in me lie.
[01:14:22] The civilian population were all active sympathizers with the VC.
[01:14:28] By seven in the morning most non-combatants would have left the village for the market.
[01:14:35] So just to make that clear what we're expecting they're expecting to go in to me lie
[01:14:40] and find over 200 fighting men and all active sympathizers with the VC.
[01:14:50] Now they start to ask some questions like okay what at the at the task force level back
[01:14:57] to the book what was to happen to the village itself task force officers left the meeting
[01:15:00] with the clear impression that Barker had ordered the destruction of all houses, dwellings
[01:15:04] and livestock in the me lie area although there is some doubt as to whether this was a
[01:15:10] director or something that been assumed.
[01:15:13] Kutak recalled Barker saying that the village was to be destroyed.
[01:15:17] He wanted the area cleaned out he wanted it neutralized and he wanted the buildings knocked
[01:15:21] down.
[01:15:22] He wanted the hooches burned he wanted the tunnels filled and he wanted the livestock
[01:15:26] and chickens run off killed or destroyed.
[01:15:30] He wanted to neutralize the area.
[01:15:32] From Adina also those were Barker's clear instructions.
[01:15:39] And what was to happen to the civilians?
[01:15:41] There is nothing to suggest that Barker explicitly ordered the murder of ordinary people
[01:15:46] of me lie.
[01:15:48] But the previous failures of the task force and the demand for more aggression the intelligence
[01:15:53] picture of a community entirely controlled by the Viet Kong, the bland assumption that civilians
[01:15:58] would be gone to the market.
[01:16:00] The totally unjustified belief that innocent people had been warned to get out of the area.
[01:16:05] In other words the entire scorched earth concept of the operation planned to neutralize
[01:16:10] the area.
[01:16:12] Drove irresistibly to the conclusion that here was a free fire zone in which even the people
[01:16:19] were to be eliminated.
[01:16:25] Now that's the company commanders getting the brief from the battalion commander from the task
[01:16:33] force commander.
[01:16:34] That's the impression that they get.
[01:16:36] Now we start to get into your Chinese telephone game because now how does that get translated
[01:16:41] down the chain of command?
[01:16:42] And even with the battalion commander talking to the company commanders, there's it's not
[01:16:47] super solid what the actual orders were.
[01:16:50] It's not it's not super solid.
[01:16:51] No one's in a hey they said kill a woman until it's kind of implied well maybe he said
[01:16:55] he wanted everyone destroyed what does destroyed mean.
[01:17:00] So now we get to where Medina is talking to his troops and his subordinate leadership
[01:17:05] the company commander.
[01:17:08] Medina grabbed a shovel from a quarter ton trailer and drew a map of me lie for in the
[01:17:13] dirt at his feet as he described the coming engagement.
[01:17:18] Tomorrow he told them was Charlie company's chance to get even.
[01:17:24] Medina relayed what he had learned at Barker's briefing earlier in the afternoon the
[01:17:28] Vietcong the 48 Vietcong Battalion were in me lie with a strength between 250 and 280.
[01:17:35] So actually he just increased that number because the report that he was given was 200.
[01:17:39] Now he's saying between 250 and 280.
[01:17:43] This meant that Charlie company would be outnumbered more than 21 but they were not to worry
[01:17:47] because helicopter gunships would be on the American side.
[01:17:50] He told them to expect a hell of a good fight.
[01:17:54] He told them that all innocent civilians would have gone to the market.
[01:18:00] He's just amplifying what he was told.
[01:18:04] But what was going to happen to the village?
[01:18:07] I told them we had permission.
[01:18:13] It was a VC stronghold to burn down the houses to kill all the livestock to cut any
[01:18:19] of the crops that might feed the VC to cave the wells and destroy the village.
[01:18:25] And what was going to happen to the innocent civilians?
[01:18:29] Somebody at the briefing asked him, do we kill women and children?
[01:18:33] It was an astounding question that speaks volumes about the temper of the men but the fact
[01:18:37] that such a question was indeed asked is not disputed.
[01:18:41] Where testimony is divided is what Medina replied.
[01:18:45] My reply to that question was no, you do not kill women and children.
[01:18:49] You must use common sense.
[01:18:51] If they have a weapon and are trying to engage you, then you can shoot back but you must
[01:18:54] use common sense.
[01:18:57] But many of the men got a different message.
[01:19:00] This is Sergeant Hodges, right, recollection of the briefing.
[01:19:04] This was a time for us to get even.
[01:19:07] A time for us to settle the score, a time for revenge.
[01:19:12] When we can get revenge for our fallen comrades, the order we were given was to kill and destroy
[01:19:18] everything that was in the village.
[01:19:20] It was to kill the pigs, drop them in the wells, pollute the water supply, kill cut down
[01:19:25] the banana trees, burn the village, burn the hooches as we went through it.
[01:19:29] It was clearly explained that there were to be no prisoners.
[01:19:34] That order was given, the order that was given was to kill everyone in the village.
[01:19:39] Someone asked if that meant the women and children and the order was everyone in the village.
[01:19:45] Because those people in that village, the women, the kids, the old men were VC.
[01:19:51] They were Vietcong themselves or they were sympathetic to the Vietcong.
[01:19:55] They were not sympathetic to the American.
[01:19:58] It was quite clear that no one was to be spared in that village.
[01:20:05] So pretty clear what Sergeant Hodges thought.
[01:20:09] So Medina says no, I didn't tell him, I told him he had to use their common sense.
[01:20:12] If the shootin' at you, then you kill him.
[01:20:14] Hodges didn't hear that.
[01:20:15] Back to the book, Sergeant Hodges was not alone and his interpretation of Medina's briefing.
[01:20:20] Many senior NCOs left the meeting convinced that the order was to kill everyone.
[01:20:26] That Sergeant Bacon, we were to kill all Vietcong and all Vietcong sympathizers in the village.
[01:20:31] Sergeant West, it was a search and destroy mission, we were to kill everything.
[01:20:37] Staff Sergeant Fagan, kill everyone.
[01:20:40] Sergeant Cowan, to kill everything that was in the village.
[01:20:43] Inlisted men too, glimpse, La Martina Gonzalez, Lloyd, Parish, Moss later testified that
[01:20:49] this is what they heard.
[01:20:51] Flynn even remembered the question, someone asked, are we supposed to kill women and
[01:20:55] children and Medina replied, kill everything that moves?
[01:21:00] Harry Stanley said, Captain Medina told us that the intelligence and established that
[01:21:05] me, lie for, was completely enemy controlled.
[01:21:09] He described the formations we were to use following day and told us to carry extra ammunition.
[01:21:15] He ordered us to kill everything in the village.
[01:21:18] The men in my squad talked about amongst ourselves that night because the order to kill
[01:21:21] everything in the village was so unusual.
[01:21:24] We all agreed that Captain Medina meant for us to kill every man, woman, and child in the
[01:21:29] village.
[01:21:33] But not everyone agreed that Medina had ordered everyone in the village to be killed.
[01:21:37] Greg Olson, who's forboating letter to his father, had been posted only two days before,
[01:21:41] has a completely different recollection of the briefing.
[01:21:45] They're clearly absolutely wasn't in order to go in and slaughter everybody in that village
[01:21:49] and anybody that says so is a liar.
[01:21:52] Medina said that any villagers were to be rounded up and airlifted to refugee camps.
[01:21:57] That was specifically addressed in the meeting.
[01:21:59] If I thought I was going to get on a helicopter that morning with clear orders that
[01:22:02] I was going to slaughter every living, breathing, human being in that village, I'm sure
[01:22:07] to God it would have been so appalling and unthinkable.
[01:22:11] I mean, I'm not that stupid.
[01:22:13] I know they couldn't have forced me to do something like that.
[01:22:18] Others too denied there was any explicit order.
[01:22:21] He was like Medina's benediction, Michael Bernhardt said.
[01:22:25] He didn't actually say to kill every man, woman, and child in me lie.
[01:22:30] He stopped just sort of saying that.
[01:22:32] He gave every other indication that that's what he expected.
[01:22:38] Whatever Medina actually said, there can be no doubt about the impression he made to get
[01:22:43] the most of the men.
[01:22:46] To hurt pride, he offered satisfaction.
[01:22:50] To grieving soldiers, he offered a chance to strike back.
[01:22:54] To bidder and resentful men, he offered an end to the frustration.
[01:23:00] Medina let slip the dogs of war.
[01:23:05] Me lie for was thrown in the path of their vindictiveness and fury.
[01:23:11] Charlie Company was going to get it revenge.
[01:23:15] The task force would get its body count.
[01:23:18] This time there would be no mistake.
[01:23:29] So that's where that's the attitude that these guys roll into the operation with.
[01:23:40] And it is not the right attitude to have going into the situation because if KC haven't
[01:23:51] figured this out, yeah, the village that they're going into, there's no battalion of
[01:23:55] the Ackong fighters.
[01:23:57] There's no fighters at all.
[01:24:02] And here they start their attack.
[01:24:06] March 16th, 1968, 715 in the morning.
[01:24:13] Out in the fields of farmer frantically raised his hands by way of both greeting and to show
[01:24:19] he had no weapon.
[01:24:21] He was immediately felled by a burst from a machine gun.
[01:24:27] Along with the gunships, almost everyone in first and second Patuans was firing their weapons
[01:24:32] and now third Patuans was joining in.
[01:24:35] The moment of Vietnamese was spotted, Vali's of fire were loose off and the enemy fell wounded
[01:24:41] or dying.
[01:24:43] It was apparent to burn heart as it was to virtually everyone gathered there on the ground
[01:24:48] that they were receiving no return fire at all.
[01:24:52] There was no incoming.
[01:25:00] The workhold came across a hut which had been raked with bullets.
[01:25:04] Inside Burkhold discovered three children, a woman with a flesh wound inside an old man
[01:25:10] squatting down, hardly able to move.
[01:25:13] He had been seriously wounded in both legs.
[01:25:16] From six feet, Burkhold aimed his 45 caliber pistol and pulled the trigger causing the
[01:25:22] top of the man's head to fly off.
[01:25:25] He was a sight that would forever be etched in Maple's memory.
[01:25:31] Burkhold claimed to have shot the old man as an active mercy.
[01:25:40] Harry Stanley saw that the fleeing villagers were offering no resistance.
[01:25:45] His friend Alan Boyce who lived in New Jersey only a couple of miles from Maple's came
[01:25:49] up behind him with a Vietnamese farmer aged between 40 and 50 years in custody.
[01:25:55] He wore black pajamas and his shirt hung open so that Stanley could see his chest.
[01:26:01] Boyce pushed the man forward to where Stanley was standing beside the trail, suddenly and
[01:26:05] for no reason Boyce stabbed the man with the bayonet attached to the end of his rifle.
[01:26:11] He felt the ground grasping for breath.
[01:26:14] Boyce killed him and then grabbed another man being detained, shot him in the neck.
[01:26:19] And threw him into a well, lobbying an M26 grenade after him.
[01:26:24] That's the way you got to do it.
[01:26:26] He told Simpson.
[01:26:31] Robert Lee, the platoon medic, joined in the frenzy but confined his efforts to slaughtering
[01:26:35] animals.
[01:26:36] He killed a cow that had been injured.
[01:26:38] Lee was from a farming community and didn't want to see the beast suffer.
[01:26:43] Up front, he in the platoon sergeant Isaiah Cowan could see women and children being slain.
[01:26:48] They were stunned by what was happening all around them.
[01:26:51] The further they went into the village, the more bodies they found.
[01:26:57] To conty and he's another guy, conty, the man appeared all psyched up when they landed.
[01:27:02] The shooting once a began, created almost a chain reaction.
[01:27:06] He joined in without killing anyone.
[01:27:08] Inside the village, his comrades appeared out of control.
[01:27:12] Families huddled together for safety and houses and yards and in bunkers only to be mown
[01:27:17] down with automatic weapon fire or blown apart by fragmentation grenades.
[01:27:22] Women and children were pushed into bunkers and grenades thrown after them.
[01:27:28] At one point wandering off on his own, conty found a woman aged about 20 with a four-year-old
[01:27:33] child.
[01:27:35] He forced her to perform oral sex on him while he held a gun at the child's head, threatening
[01:27:40] to kill it.
[01:27:45] Half a dozen people from both platoons then witnessed a stocky blonde-haired second platoon
[01:27:51] soldier from Kansas City called Gary Rochovitz become hysterical when troops from first
[01:27:56] platoon were walking a small group of villagers back for screening.
[01:28:00] Rochovitz aged 25 was older than most of the grunts in the company.
[01:28:04] Standing almost six feet tall and weighing close to 230 pounds, he made a surprise grab for
[01:28:09] Roy Woods M-16 and demanded the weapon as a trade for his M-79 but Wood wasn't having any.
[01:28:16] Don't turn them over to the company, Rochovitz peeled to those gathered there, killed them.
[01:28:21] Wood, who was physically by far as the smaller of the two men, held tightly onto his
[01:28:25] rifle.
[01:28:26] Rochovitz then snatched a hold of Bernardo Simpson's M-16, turned in shot of Vietnamese farmer
[01:28:32] in the head.
[01:28:34] Wood began feeling sick at the side of the man's brain spilling on the ground as he turned away.
[01:28:40] Rochovitz shot two more peasants in the head before handing the gun back to Simpson.
[01:28:47] In the northern position of the village second platoon had also run berserk.
[01:28:54] Employing the routine combat assault technique used by Kali, Stephen Brooksmen also approached
[01:28:59] line of breast and three squads.
[01:29:02] During as they moved they came to dwellings and yelled out lie-day and Vietnamese for come
[01:29:06] here.
[01:29:08] The villagers at the villagers sheltering inside, homemade shelters or bunkers.
[01:29:15] Fragmentation grenades were tossed inside.
[01:29:17] Homes were sprayed with automatic fire.
[01:29:20] Children aged six or seven came toward them with their hands out stretch saying chop chop.
[01:29:25] They asked for food and candy they had received from other American soldiers on the two
[01:29:29] previous visits to the village.
[01:29:32] The soldiers skythed them down.
[01:29:35] After one group of Vietnamese were killed in front of a hot, the first squad leader, Sergeant
[01:29:40] Kenneth Sheel began telling his men that he didn't like what they were doing but that they
[01:29:45] had to obey orders.
[01:29:48] The villagers had to huddled together for safety but the Americans poured fire into them,
[01:29:52] tearing their bodies apart.
[01:29:54] One man firing a machine gun at random, other using M16's on automatic.
[01:30:05] Brooks radio operator Dean Fields witnessed for not a sense in shoot a woman with a baby
[01:30:09] from a distance of about 25 meters.
[01:30:12] Her arm was shot almost completely off at the wrist.
[01:30:15] All that it held, all that held it on was a fragile piece of flesh.
[01:30:20] She ran into a hooch and someone yelled in order for her and the baby to be killed.
[01:30:27] Max Hudson, the weapon squad leader formed a machine gun team with Floyd Wright as soon
[01:30:31] as they passed the tree line, they were confronted less than 30 feet away by a middle-aged
[01:30:36] woman climbing out of a tunnel using both hands.
[01:30:39] She was unarmed but they opened fire and she fell back into the tunnel.
[01:30:43] Hudson and Wright took turns on the machine gun whenever they came across any Vietnamese
[01:30:47] they opened fire, killing them.
[01:30:50] Hudson could see people firing all around him.
[01:30:52] The whole scene was one of chaos and confusion with people moving, yelling and shouting.
[01:30:59] Some of the troops were afraid they would be shot by their own men.
[01:31:08] In the clearing near a small couch, a group of 15 feet in a maze had been gathered for women
[01:31:14] and their 30s, three in their 50s, three girls in their late teens and five children ages
[01:31:19] between three and 14.
[01:31:22] Standing around were seven or eight soldiers from different squads including Huto, Torres
[01:31:26] and Rochovats.
[01:31:28] Gonzalez heard someone yell that if anyone was behind the Vietnamese to take cover because
[01:31:32] they were going to open fire.
[01:31:34] A shot rang out on a bullet penetrated the head of a young child being carried by its mother,
[01:31:40] blowing out the back of its skull.
[01:31:43] Others began firing until the entire group was dead.
[01:31:48] Gonzalez could stand no more, he turned away and vomited.
[01:31:52] Few words were spoken until someone said, let's move out.
[01:31:58] A soldier's stooping over a tunnel yelled for the occupants to come out.
[01:32:02] Gonzalez moved closer and could hear people responding as if they were about to comply.
[01:32:06] Whereupon the soldier threw in a grenade and yelled fire in the hole, telling everyone to stand
[01:32:12] clear.
[01:32:15] Kelly had been called twice that morning on the radio by an anxious Medina.
[01:32:22] What is happening over there?
[01:32:23] Medina demanded to know, challenging the slow progress of the first platoon.
[01:32:29] He wanted Kelly to get his men back online and keep moving.
[01:32:33] This made the young platoon commander nervous throughout his time with the company he had
[01:32:38] frequently been made the butt of Medina's jokes.
[01:32:41] Medina knew Kelly couldn't command the respect of his men.
[01:32:44] Now, under pressure, Kelly replied that large groups of civilians had gathered and were
[01:32:49] slowing the platoon down.
[01:32:52] Never one to accept excuses, Medina told Kelly simply to get rid of them.
[01:32:57] So when Kelly came across, Miedlo and Kanti in the clearing and said, take care of them,
[01:33:02] his intention was clear.
[01:33:04] It was his way of getting Medina off his back.
[01:33:08] He thought nothing of the implications of Kelly's request when he simply replied, okay.
[01:33:14] Like many in the company, he regarded the man as a joke and resented cat the way Kelly tried
[01:33:19] to suck up to the men one minute by calling them by their first names and then shouted
[01:33:23] and bald at them the next.
[01:33:26] Kanti felt his platoon commander had absolutely no leadership ability.
[01:33:31] Among the squatting Vietnamese were 10 to 15 men with beards and 10 women, women, as well
[01:33:37] as a handful of very elderly gray-haired women who could hardly walk.
[01:33:41] The rest were children of all ages from babies up to early teens.
[01:33:48] Kelly, who was carrying a band-alir of ammunition on one shoulder, said, I thought I told you
[01:33:53] to take care of them.
[01:33:55] Miedlo responded, somewhat naively, we are.
[01:33:59] We're watching over them.
[01:34:02] No reposted, Kelly.
[01:34:04] I want them killed.
[01:34:05] He moved over to where Kanti was standing beside Miedlo.
[01:34:10] We'll get online and fire into them.
[01:34:14] Kanti and Miedlo look each other and backed off, neither of them wanting a part in what
[01:34:18] was about to happen.
[01:34:20] Kelly, losing his temper, back in them, toward him, come here.
[01:34:24] Come on, we'll line them up and we'll kill them.
[01:34:27] Kanti searching for an excuse pointed out that he was carrying a grenade launcher and he didn't
[01:34:31] want a way to ammunition.
[01:34:33] Perhaps it could keep guard over by the tree-line in case anyone tried to get away.
[01:34:36] He suggested.
[01:34:38] Kelly turned to Miedlo.
[01:34:41] Fire when I say, fire.
[01:34:45] Kanti stood behind them as Cally and Miedlo standing side by side blazed away.
[01:34:50] They stood only ten feet from their hapless victims, changing magazines from time to time.
[01:34:55] The Vietnamese screamed, yelled, and tried to get up.
[01:35:00] He was pure carnage as heads were shot off along with limbs, the fleshier body parts
[01:35:05] were ripped to shreds.
[01:35:08] Miedlo had taken 23 fully loaded magazines for his M16 in his pack when they had left
[01:35:13] thoughty.
[01:35:14] He fired in a spring motion.
[01:35:17] He noticed one man dressed in red, followed that as he fired the rifle on automatic until
[01:35:22] the magazine was exhausted.
[01:35:24] Then he reloaded.
[01:35:26] He switched to semi-automatic fire and loaded the third magazine.
[01:35:31] After a minute or so Miedlo couldn't continue.
[01:35:35] Tears flooded down his cheeks.
[01:35:39] He turned, stuck his rifle in Kanti's hand and said, you shoot them.
[01:35:43] Kanti pushed the weapon back.
[01:35:45] If they are going to be killed, I'm not going to do it.
[01:35:48] Let him do it.
[01:35:49] He said pointing a Cally by this time Kanti could see only a few children were left standing.
[01:35:56] Mothers had thrown themselves on top of the young ones in the last desperate bid to protect
[01:36:01] them from bullets raining down on them.
[01:36:04] The children were trying to stand up.
[01:36:07] Cally opened fire again, killing them one by one.
[01:36:12] Kanti swore at him.
[01:36:14] Finally, when it appeared to be all over, Cally calmly turned and said, okay, let's go.
[01:36:23] Only someone yelled out that more Vietnamese, five women and six children, some distance
[01:36:27] away were making a break for the tree line.
[01:36:31] Cally burst out, get them, get them, kill them.
[01:36:37] Miedlo's face was flushed.
[01:36:40] His eyes were still full of tears when he arrived with greysick at the ditch site and found
[01:36:46] Cally sitting down.
[01:36:48] We've got another job to do.
[01:36:50] He said, looking up them.
[01:36:53] About 10 members of the platoon were guarding 40 to 50 Vietnamese babies, crying and crawling
[01:36:58] around.
[01:36:59] James Dursey, a heavy set Irish Italian from Brooklyn, was looking at a man in white
[01:37:05] robes with a go-tbe beard whom he took to be a Buddhist monk praying over an elderly woman.
[01:37:11] She was seriously ill and had been carried through the village on a narrow wooden platform
[01:37:14] which the Vietnamese used as a bed.
[01:37:17] Cally was now one of his feet.
[01:37:19] Cally was standing up here on the scene and tried to question the monk who was crying and
[01:37:22] bowing as he tried to make himself understood.
[01:37:26] Cally could not understand him.
[01:37:28] Greasick, who had attended Vietnamese language classes in Hawaii, tried more questions and
[01:37:33] got nowhere.
[01:37:35] Cally was getting more and more impatient.
[01:37:38] Where had the Viet Cong gone?
[01:37:40] Where were the weapons?
[01:37:41] Where were the NVA?
[01:37:43] When the man shook his head, Cally struck him in the mouth with his rifle but.
[01:37:47] Just then a child aged about two years and parted from its mother managed to crawl up to
[01:37:52] the top of the ditch.
[01:37:54] Dursey watched horrified as Cally picked up the child, shoved it back down the slope and
[01:37:59] shot it before returning to question the monk.
[01:38:02] The villagers pleaded for the holy man's life.
[01:38:05] Stanley asked the bearded man the same questions in Vietnamese that Cally was asking an
[01:38:09] English and effort to defuse the situation.
[01:38:13] The monk's vainly replied that there were no North Vietnamese soldiers in the village.
[01:38:18] There were no weapons.
[01:38:21] Stanley translated these replies immediately Cally grabbed the monk, pulled him round, hurled
[01:38:27] him into the patty and opened fire with me those N16.
[01:38:31] As the elderly mamasan lying prostrate tried to get up, she too was killed.
[01:38:41] Her Vietnamese shepherded by soldiers were arriving on the scene and Cally indicated a
[01:38:46] me low in voice he wanted everyone killed.
[01:38:49] He began pushing peasants into the irrigation channel.
[01:38:52] Others joined in using their rifle butts to shove wailing Vietnamese down the sleep steep
[01:38:57] slope.
[01:38:59] Some jumped in by themselves, others sat down on the edge, moaning and crying, clearly aware
[01:39:06] that disaster was imminent.
[01:39:09] It was a pitiful sight.
[01:39:11] Until the time all the firing started, Herbert Carter had been kneeling beside Dersie, quietly
[01:39:17] playing with a couple of children.
[01:39:20] Dersie said incredulously, I think Cally wants them all killed.
[01:39:24] Carter said, oh no.
[01:39:28] He can send me to jail, but I'm not going to kill anybody said Dersie, beginning to move
[01:39:31] away and wondering what would happen to him for refusing to fire.
[01:39:35] Dersie was another one who liked to play with the children.
[01:39:39] Earlier in the day he'd been devastated after he opened fire and killed someone running
[01:39:42] from the village.
[01:39:43] It turned out to be a woman carrying a baby in Dersie who was horrified and ashamed by what
[01:39:47] he had done.
[01:39:49] Olson had seen he was really cut up about it.
[01:39:52] A woman standing next to Robert Maples showed him a bullet wound in her left arm.
[01:39:57] He felt helpless.
[01:39:58] There was nothing he could do for her.
[01:40:01] Cally shoved her in the ditch and told Maples, load your machine gun and shoot these people.
[01:40:07] Maples shook his head and replied, I'm not going to do that.
[01:40:10] Cally turned his M16 on Maples as if to shoot him then and there.
[01:40:14] Maples was surprised and relieved when some of the other soldiers interposed to protect him.
[01:40:19] Cally backed off.
[01:40:22] Seconds later, he and meed low began firing.
[01:40:26] A machine gun opened up and one of the squad leaders tried to usher the man into lines so
[01:40:31] they could all fire simultaneously.
[01:40:34] Mercy stood completely frozen, watching disbelievingly as the Vietnamese tried frantically
[01:40:39] to hide under one another, mothers protecting babies.
[01:40:45] Screaming at Dersie above the sounds of M16 on full automatic, meed low continued pouring
[01:40:50] shells into the ditch.
[01:40:53] Crying hysterically once more, he stopped for a second.
[01:40:56] Why are you firing?
[01:40:57] He pleaded with Dersie.
[01:40:59] Fire, why don't you fire?
[01:41:01] The onlookers saw remnants of shredded human beings, hundreds of pieces of flesh and bone
[01:41:07] flying up in the air as the shallower ofine was repeatedly sprayed with bullets.
[01:41:14] Magazine after magazine was reloaded during the mass execution.
[01:41:26] And as all this horrendous scene is unfolding, there is actually a photographer there,
[01:41:39] military photographer, himhaberlay, and he's taking pictures.
[01:41:50] And he was almost like he was just instinctively shooting, he kind of detached himself.
[01:41:59] And here's what he said.
[01:42:00] I knew it was something that shouldn't be happening, but yet I was part of it.
[01:42:05] I think I was in a kind of a days from seeing all these shootings and not seeing any return
[01:42:09] fire yet the killing kept going on.
[01:42:13] The Americans were rounding up the people and shooting them not taking any prisoners.
[01:42:17] I was completely different to my concept of what war is all about.
[01:42:21] I kept taking pictures.
[01:42:22] That was my job as a photographer to take pictures.
[01:42:24] A normal reaction I have with a camera just picking up and keep on shooting, trying to capture
[01:42:30] what is happening around me.
[01:42:33] I feel sometimes that the camera did take over during the operation.
[01:42:37] I put it up to my eye, took a shot, put it down, nothing was composed, nothing was
[01:42:41] pre-thought, just a normal reaction of a photographer.
[01:42:46] I was part of it.
[01:42:47] Everyone who is there was part of it and that includes the general and the colonel flying
[01:42:51] above and their helicopters, they're all part of it.
[01:42:56] We all were just a one big group.
[01:43:02] Now as all this is happening, you've got Medina who's the again the company commander.
[01:43:09] He's sort of coming up from the rear.
[01:43:13] And he's starting to assess what he's seeing.
[01:43:17] Back to the book, while Medina might not have seen mass executions taking place, the evidence
[01:43:21] of his own eyes told him what everyone else could see that some kind of massacre had occurred.
[01:43:28] In fact, it was worse than a massacre.
[01:43:31] Too many of Medina's men were taking sword pleasure in sadistic behavior.
[01:43:37] People became double veterans, GI slang for the dubious honor of raping a woman and then
[01:43:44] murdering her.
[01:43:47] Many women were raped and solemnized, mutilated and had their vaginas ripped open with knives
[01:43:53] or bayonets.
[01:43:56] One woman was killed when the muzzle of a rifle barrel was inserted into her vagina and
[01:44:00] the trigger was pulled.
[01:44:04] Others repeatedly stabbed their victims, cut off limbs, sometimes beheaded them.
[01:44:11] Some were scout, others had their tongues cut out or their throat slit or both.
[01:44:18] Tommy Lee Moss saw Vietnamese placed their hands together and bowed agreed Americans,
[01:44:23] only to be beaten with fists and tortured club with rifles and stabbed in the back with bayonets.
[01:44:30] Some faggin saw bodies which had been shot in the head at point blank range.
[01:44:34] He could tell because the penetration of an M16 round created a shockwave inside the skull
[01:44:39] forcing the brain completely out.
[01:44:43] Other victims were mutilated with the signature C company or the shape of an ace of spades
[01:44:48] carved into the chest.
[01:44:51] Faggin figured this had been done as a warning to the superstitious Vietnamese.
[01:44:54] Those widely believed that they regard the ace of spades as a sign of bad luck.
[01:45:01] Troops from all three platoons cleared out one and mindless acts of brutality.
[01:45:07] The second platoon were already amongst the most notorious rapists in Charlie Company,
[01:45:13] even the platoon commander joined in on occasions.
[01:45:19] The poshivets forced the women to undress with the intention of having sex with all of them.
[01:45:26] If they didn't strip, he said he was going to shoot them.
[01:45:28] He singled out one woman telling her to boom boom him.
[01:45:32] She became hysterical and the other women panicked yelling and screaming and begging for
[01:45:36] mercy, rushivets decided to let them have it.
[01:45:41] He fired several rounds and killed them all.
[01:45:45] And now we got hobbley again, he's the photographer and this is what he's witnessing.
[01:45:50] Just as soon as I turned away, I heard firing.
[01:45:52] I saw people drop.
[01:45:54] They started falling on top of each other, one on top of another.
[01:45:58] I just kept walking.
[01:45:59] I did not pay attention to who did it.
[01:46:01] By that time I knew what the score was, it wasn't atrocity.
[01:46:05] I felt I wanted to do something to stop this as though as we were going through the village,
[01:46:09] I asked some soldiers, why?
[01:46:12] They more or less shrugged their soldiers and kept on with the killing.
[01:46:16] It was like they were fixed on one thing, searching destroy, and that meant killing civilians.
[01:46:23] I noticed this one small boy had been shot in the foot.
[01:46:26] Part of the foot was torn off, he was walking towards a group of bodies looking for his mother.
[01:46:31] I put up my camera up to my eye.
[01:46:34] I was going to take a photograph.
[01:46:37] I didn't notice a GI down beside me with a Zem16 rifle pointed at the child.
[01:46:43] Then suddenly I heard the crack and through the viewfinder I saw this child flip over
[01:46:47] on top of the pile of bodies.
[01:46:51] The GI just stood up and walked away.
[01:46:55] No remorse, nothing.
[01:46:58] The other soldiers had a cold reaction.
[01:47:00] They were staring off into space like it was in every day thing.
[01:47:04] They felt they had to do it and they did it.
[01:47:08] That was their job.
[01:47:10] It was weird just a shrug of the shoulder, no emotional reaction.
[01:47:17] Now above this horror, you had helicopters that were flying around.
[01:47:26] Some of them were gunships, some of them were there to pick people up, drop people off,
[01:47:31] some of them were command and control helicopters where some senior leadership was flying
[01:47:36] around, trying to observe the battles that took place.
[01:47:40] We do end up with a real hero here.
[01:47:45] A hero, that's a helicopter pilot.
[01:47:53] His name is Hugh Klauer's Thompson Jr.
[01:48:00] He's flying around and I'll go to the book.
[01:48:04] Thompson marked several wounded people on the ground with green smoke, a signal that they
[01:48:08] needed help.
[01:48:10] Returning to the me lie area, about 9 a.m.
[01:48:15] After the first refueling Thompson, mealy noticed that people who were previously injured
[01:48:19] were now dead.
[01:48:21] There were groups of bodies as well as many dead water buffalo.
[01:48:24] Over the radio he warned the gunships to fire only when they could positively identify
[01:48:28] enemy target.
[01:48:30] They had good visibility as they hovered sometimes only four feet, five feet off the ground.
[01:48:36] Gunner Lawrence Colburn in the doorway didn't want to look at the corpses.
[01:48:42] Out in the patty field beside a dike, 200 meters south of the village they watched a small
[01:48:48] group of soldiers approaching injured woman of age 20.
[01:48:52] Thompson had marked her with smoke.
[01:48:54] They were flying close enough for Colburn to look at her face as she lay half in and
[01:48:57] half out of the dike.
[01:48:59] She made a fievel gesture with her hand and was obviously a need of help.
[01:49:04] Thompson put the aircraft into a standstill hover only a few feet off the ground.
[01:49:08] The high gunship told the ground forces on the radio, you have a wounded over where the
[01:49:12] bubble is hovering.
[01:49:15] Thompson and his crew watched as an infantry officer wearing captains bars on his helmet,
[01:49:20] came up to the woman, prodder with his foot, and then killed her.
[01:49:25] Who's in the helicopter could hardly believe what they were seeing.
[01:49:30] Minutes later, over on the eastern side of the village they saw dozens of bodies in the
[01:49:33] air, deigation ditch.
[01:49:36] Movements from the ditch convinced them there were people still alive.
[01:49:40] Not far away a group of infantry men taking a cigarette break sat around on the ground and
[01:49:44] relaxed, taking off their steel pots.
[01:49:48] It was obvious there was no firefight taking place.
[01:49:53] So now what happens is Thompson, he's starting to get, he's starting to be totally disturbed
[01:50:00] by what he's seen down there.
[01:50:01] So he lands the helicopter and gets out of the helicopter and he goes over and talks to a
[01:50:07] young infantry officer.
[01:50:09] A young infantry officer came up and Thompson questioned him about what was happening on
[01:50:13] the ground.
[01:50:14] The officer said that it was none of his business because he was in charge of the ground
[01:50:18] troops.
[01:50:19] Several members of Kelly's platoon observed Thompson's intervention.
[01:50:23] Kelly had gone to speak with the bubble helicopter pilot.
[01:50:26] Stanley overheard Kelly telling sledge forward sledge afterward that the pilot hadn't
[01:50:31] liked what he was taking place.
[01:50:34] He didn't like the way I'm running the show, but I'm the boss here.
[01:50:38] Olson, who wanted no part in the executions at the irrigation ditch, had moved 150 meters
[01:50:43] out to the patty field to set up a perimeter of defense.
[01:50:47] He saw the pilot angrily shaking his arms and just circulating.
[01:50:51] He frustrated Thompson lifted off again in circled area for a few minutes.
[01:50:56] Almost as soon as he took off, his worst fears were confirmed.
[01:51:01] Andraida reported the sergeant was now shooting the people in the ditch.
[01:51:05] Thompson began thinking about what the Nazis had done in the last war, marching people to
[01:51:09] a ditch and blowing them away.
[01:51:11] Furious with himself and everybody else he finally snapped.
[01:51:15] He flew over the northeast corner of the village and spotted a group of about 10 civilians
[01:51:20] including children running towards a homemade bomb shelter.
[01:51:24] Pursuing them were a group of from second-paltoon returning to the village from their murderous
[01:51:28] expedition.
[01:51:30] Based on all he had seen in the village that morning it was obvious to Thompson what
[01:51:33] would happen when the troops got to the fleeing civilians.
[01:51:37] He landed his aircraft between the villagers and the soldiers and radioed the gunships he needed
[01:51:42] help.
[01:51:43] Screaming to his crew that he had to get the people out of the bunker he issued an instruction
[01:51:47] that be, be wielded Colburn.
[01:51:50] If the Americans began shooting on the villagers Thompson said Colburn would turn his machine
[01:51:54] gun on the Americans, open up on him, blow him away Thompson urged him.
[01:51:59] Colburn turned his gun around to face the G.I.s though he was unsure whether he would be
[01:52:03] able to open fire on his own men.
[01:52:06] Concerned for their own safety Colburn wasn't sure it was a good idea to land in the middle
[01:52:10] of a combat zone.
[01:52:12] The pilot confronted the lieutenant in charge Stephen Brooks.
[01:52:17] He said he wanted to help get the peasants out of the bunker, Brooks told him the only
[01:52:21] way to do that was with hand grenades.
[01:52:23] Thompson shouted that he would personally get them out and told Lieutenant to stay put.
[01:52:28] With that he went across the bunker and genuinely coaxed the civilians to come out.
[01:52:33] Crew members in the gunships overhead heard Thompson announce over the radio that an old man
[01:52:39] was sitting in the path of the troops near the door of a small bomb shelter.
[01:52:43] Thompson's voice was choking with emotion.
[01:52:46] The swarm of senators, cursed and pleaded with the arrow crew to come down and help rescue
[01:52:51] civilians.
[01:52:52] One pilot initially queried at the request.
[01:52:55] Thompson threatened that if the infantry opened fire on the civilians his machine
[01:52:59] gunner would turn his guns on the Americans.
[01:53:03] Danny Millions a war officer on the low gunship realized the delicate nature of the drama
[01:53:08] unfolding below and knowing that Thompson couldn't talk directly with the ground troops
[01:53:13] radio the high gunship to tell the infantry to stop killing.
[01:53:17] Millions and Brian living in another pilot landed their ships and flew the Vietnamese
[01:53:22] two men, two women and five or six children four miles away to the safety of the road
[01:53:28] which ran west.
[01:53:32] I mean this you can't get any more drama than that.
[01:53:37] And eventually Thompson gets back to base and I'll go to the book.
[01:53:46] They arrived back at Doddy at about 11 a.m.
[01:53:49] Thompson got out of the aircraft and threw his helmet on the ground.
[01:53:53] He cold his section leader what had happened and when Millions and Livingston landed
[01:53:57] they confirmed it.
[01:53:59] A group of them sought out their company commander, major Fred Watky in the aviation sections
[01:54:05] operation van.
[01:54:07] They told him everything they had seen.
[01:54:09] Watky walked up the hill to the low ceiling 10 of the tactical operation center and passed
[01:54:13] the information on the barker.
[01:54:15] He in turn quickly got on the radio to his executive officer, major Charles Calhoun who
[01:54:20] was flying in a helicopter over the battle zone.
[01:54:23] Calhoun was instructed to find out what was happening and get it stopped.
[01:54:28] There had been allegations that civilians had been shot.
[01:54:31] The doctor wanted his insurance from a dean of that nothing of this kind was happening.
[01:54:37] The order went out to Charlie Company to cease fire and they did.
[01:54:49] And almost as quickly as it started it stopped.
[01:54:59] It shows you that this whole time when all this horror was taking place.
[01:55:12] Anybody could have stopped it.
[01:55:14] Had they stepped up and said something and spoke.
[01:55:21] Now it might have been hard for someone that's a junior and listed guy that's 18 years
[01:55:24] old that thinks he's carrying out the mission but any of those people in the leadership
[01:55:26] position.
[01:55:29] And even some of the folks at work leadership position if you're there and you start to
[01:55:34] say no this isn't going to be happening.
[01:55:37] I mean and you did or some guys on the ground that resisted but no one was able to actually
[01:55:42] stop it.
[01:55:44] And it's one of those bizarre things when I hear that all it took was that order to see
[01:55:50] fire and okay well stop shooting.
[01:55:54] It shows you the power of leadership and the responsibility of leadership.
[01:56:08] Now as this story goes forward the first thing that happens is a big cover up and they
[01:56:16] talk about this operation like it was just a great victory over the VC and in fact a message
[01:56:23] I'm going to the book here a message of congratulations for the pink feel operation.
[01:56:27] That's what the operation is called pink feel was received from general West Moreland
[01:56:31] himself in a post-grip that brigade commander described the me lie operation as having
[01:56:40] been an outstanding success.
[01:56:42] The praise worthy role of units in the eleventh infantry brigade directly reflects your
[01:56:47] expert guidance leadership and devotion to duty he wrote to Medina copying the memo to
[01:56:53] Barker.
[01:56:55] The quick response and professionalism displayed during this action has enhanced the brigade's
[01:57:00] image in the eyes of higher commands.
[01:57:05] So there you go.
[01:57:08] Within a few hours the army's PR machine was pumping out a colorful image of daring
[01:57:13] due by the American troops.
[01:57:17] The Mac V communique issued later the same day from Saigon gave brief details the operation
[01:57:23] announcing that American division forces had killed 128 enemy six miles northeast of
[01:57:30] Quining City, US troops surrounded reds, kill 128.
[01:57:37] There's another headline that went out that said TF Barker crushes enemy stronghold.
[01:57:43] That attitude continues now Barker, the battalion commander, ends up being killed before
[01:57:52] he's killed his he releases his assessment of the operation and this is what he starts
[01:57:59] as you see cover up written all over this.
[01:58:02] Here's Barker's official report.
[01:58:07] This operation was well planned, well executed and successful.
[01:58:10] Only casualties were light and the enemy suffered heavily.
[01:58:14] On this operation the civilian population supporting the VC in the area numbered approximately
[01:58:18] 200.
[01:58:20] This created a problem in population control and medical care of those civilians caught in
[01:58:24] the fire of opposing forces.
[01:58:26] However the infantry unit on the ground and helicopters were able to assist civilians and
[01:58:30] leaving the area and in caring for and or evacuating the wounded.
[01:58:35] This lies just lies another another piece.
[01:58:43] Barker was genuinely concerned that civilians be protected in future operations and there's
[01:58:48] no way he could have known the dreadful atrocity being committed by Charlie Company
[01:58:52] at the time it was happening but it's clear he quickly became part of the cover up.
[01:58:58] He knew civilians had died and a lot of them.
[01:59:03] Now so this starts to gain a little bit of traction people are starting to talk about
[01:59:08] there's rumors of even though these big nice headlines come out and the official report
[01:59:14] comes out but people start to know about it.
[01:59:17] And so they start sending Charlie Company and all kinds of crazy long term operations
[01:59:21] out in the field and they start to feel like well good to look.
[01:59:26] GIs felt they were being sent out in the hopes that they all might be killed.
[01:59:32] They tried to bury us out there when we're bitterly remembered.
[01:59:36] After me lie we went out in the field for three months straight.
[01:59:41] We never came back into the villages.
[01:59:42] Our trips to the base camps were few and far between.
[01:59:45] They had a problem and dealt with us by trying to hide out and hide out in the jungle hoping
[01:59:50] we'd all get killed but we didn't.
[01:59:59] So a guy, like I said people are talking about it there's rumors about it and there's
[02:00:05] a guy named Rightenauer who checks in to Charlie Company and he starts here in stories.
[02:00:14] He starts here in stories.
[02:00:15] He starts they start telling them they start talking and this is why you can't ever cover
[02:00:18] anything up.
[02:00:19] This is why cover up's never worked.
[02:00:21] Never trying to cover anything up because it's going to come out.
[02:00:24] It's going to come out.
[02:00:25] If you try and cover something up it's going to come out.
[02:00:27] That's the way it works.
[02:00:29] So this guy, right now, after he hears enough and he talks to all these different people
[02:00:36] that are more involved and they tell him what they did and what went down and he kind of
[02:00:41] gathers all that information.
[02:00:44] Here we go back to the book.
[02:00:47] Rightenauer, he writes a letter.
[02:00:48] He writes a letter that explains what he had learned, what he'd found out.
[02:00:53] Here we go right now, we're posted the letter on April 2nd, 1969 to you doll and 30 prominent
[02:01:00] men in Washington DC including President Nixon, the Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird,
[02:01:07] the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Edward Kennedy, Barry Goldwater, Eugene McCarthy
[02:01:11] and William Fulbright.
[02:01:14] He sent the letters a registered mail thinking that staff opening them would be bound to
[02:01:17] take the comments to contents more seriously.
[02:01:20] And here's a little excerpt from the letter, gentlemen, it was in late April 1968 that
[02:01:27] I first heard of Pinkville and what allegedly happened there.
[02:01:32] I received that first report with some skepticism but in the following months I was
[02:01:37] to hear similar stories from such a wide variety of people that it became impossible for
[02:01:42] me to disbelieve that something rather dark and bloody did indeed occur sometime in March
[02:01:48] 1968 in a village called Pinkville in the Republic of Vietnam.
[02:01:59] So that's how the story breaks.
[02:02:01] They start to investigate it.
[02:02:04] Within the Pentagon, they start to investigate this great, this book is great, goes into
[02:02:08] a ton of detail on what that's like, how that takes place.
[02:02:12] The people that are running it and there's good, honest, solid army leadership that says,
[02:02:19] oh no, we're going to find out what happened and we're going to do something about it.
[02:02:24] So the cover up isn't throughout the chain of commanders, people that try and put a stop
[02:02:28] to it.
[02:02:29] Now the other thing that turns very interesting on this is obviously when it hits the public.
[02:02:38] And one of the most shocking impacts to the public took place on television.
[02:02:45] And if you remember at this time, and I don't know if this was like for you because you're
[02:02:49] a little bit younger than me, but when I was a kid, we had three TV channels.
[02:02:54] There was no 57 or 147 or 1000 TV channels.
[02:02:59] There was no internet.
[02:03:01] We didn't really, there wasn't really radio shows anymore.
[02:03:03] So if the family was going to do something at night at six o'clock at night or seven o'clock
[02:03:07] at night together after dinner, there was a good chance they were going to sit down and watch TV.
[02:03:12] And now you go back this 1969.
[02:03:14] So it's even more focused on television.
[02:03:18] And so what happens is this story breaks on TV with an interview and I'll go to the
[02:03:25] book with me, those confession.
[02:03:29] Television was for most Americans, quintessentially a medium of entertainment.
[02:03:34] The lead-lo's confession was truly an extraordinary departure from the vapid diet of soap
[02:03:39] operas comedy programs and quiz shows.
[02:03:43] News, however, was important to American audiences.
[02:03:46] Walter Kronkite was a national institution.
[02:03:49] Meadlo's interview was delivered virtually without warning to an audience of millions of
[02:03:54] parents and children waiting excitedly for news of Apollo 12's astronauts return from
[02:04:00] the moon and the splash down into the Pacific Ocean.
[02:04:04] That's what everyone thinks that's what they're going to say.
[02:04:05] Oh, let's get the kids to watch the news.
[02:04:07] And we'll find out about, yay, yay, America.
[02:04:11] Back to the book.
[02:04:12] Instead, they're living rooms appeared the gauchess figure of a young man from Indiana.
[02:04:18] Meadlo brought to the audience a raw truth about Vietnam.
[02:04:22] They would prefer not to have known.
[02:04:25] He chillingly described lining up first the first group of villagers and shooting them
[02:04:30] down, expanding four clips of ammunition in the killing.
[02:04:34] There were 17 bullets to a clip which meant Wallace deducted deduced 68 shots.
[02:04:42] At the ditch execution site, Meadlo said he was ordered to fire single shots to conserve
[02:04:47] ammunition.
[02:04:50] Wallace wanted to know why he did it.
[02:04:56] And here's the interview.
[02:04:57] Why did I do it?
[02:04:59] Because I felt like I was ordered to do it and it seemed like that at the time I
[02:05:04] felt like I was doing the right thing because I lost buddies.
[02:05:07] I lost a damn good buddy Bobby Wilson and it was on my conscience.
[02:05:12] So after I done it, I felt good.
[02:05:15] But later on that day, it was getting to me.
[02:05:20] You're married, right?
[02:05:23] Children, too.
[02:05:25] How old?
[02:05:27] The boy is two and a half and the little girl is a year and a half.
[02:05:31] Well, obviously the question comes to mind, the father of two little kids like that,
[02:05:36] how can you shoot babies?
[02:05:39] I didn't have the little girl.
[02:05:40] I just had the little boy at the time.
[02:05:43] How do you shoot babies?
[02:05:45] I don't know.
[02:05:46] It's just one of them things.
[02:05:49] How many people would you imagine were killed that day?
[02:05:52] I would say 370.
[02:05:56] What did these civilians, these particularly the women and children, the old men, what did
[02:06:00] they do?
[02:06:01] What did they say to you?
[02:06:03] They weren't begging or anything?
[02:06:05] No, no, or right.
[02:06:07] They were begging and saying no, no, and their mothers were hugging their children, but
[02:06:12] they kept on firing.
[02:06:15] Well, we kept on firing.
[02:06:17] They was waving their arms and begging.
[02:06:21] Did you ever dream about all this that went on in pinkville?
[02:06:25] Yes, I did.
[02:06:27] And I still dream about it.
[02:06:29] What kind of dreams?
[02:06:31] I see the women and children in my sleep.
[02:06:35] Some days, some nights, I can't sleep.
[02:06:40] I just lay there thinking about it.
[02:06:44] So that's not exactly the friendly news that you're expecting to see about the Apollo
[02:06:49] mission.
[02:06:53] Now this thing goes to trial.
[02:06:56] And again, you got to get into the book to see how all this breaks down.
[02:07:01] But a couple highlights.
[02:07:02] Here's Lieutenant Callie during the trial on how he testified on what he did.
[02:07:13] And this is a good insight into his mind, said, here we go.
[02:07:16] Lieutenant Callie.
[02:07:17] I was ordered to go in there and destroy the enemy.
[02:07:20] That was my job that day.
[02:07:22] That was my mission.
[02:07:23] I was given.
[02:07:24] I did not sit down and think in terms of men, women, and children.
[02:07:27] They were all classified the same.
[02:07:29] And that was the classification that we dealt with just as enemy soldiers.
[02:07:34] I felt then.
[02:07:35] And I still do that I acted as I was directed.
[02:07:38] And I carried out the orders that I was given.
[02:07:40] And I do not feel wrong in doing so.
[02:07:44] And we get very used to the media.
[02:07:51] I mean, we're in a media circus.
[02:07:54] Nowadays, because there's so much media, there's social media, there's cable media,
[02:07:58] there's internet media.
[02:07:59] I mean, we get there's a circus of media now.
[02:08:02] And you get a lot, I would say, you can get a lot more distracted.
[02:08:05] I mean, new stories here don't last that long.
[02:08:07] But this was a big new story.
[02:08:09] And it was really dividing the country in a way even more so than the country is already
[02:08:15] being divided by the Vietnam War.
[02:08:17] But, and I'll go to the book here, to many Americans, Callie was a hero.
[02:08:23] And they believed that with the guilty verdict he was found guilty, a great injustice
[02:08:27] had been perpetrated upon the army.
[02:08:29] And in Vietnam, they gave an example here in Vietnam that soldiers at K-Son had hastily
[02:08:36] raised a defiant sign that said, a troop first-cav, salutes William Callie.
[02:08:45] So you got people that are saying, hey, what, you know, Callie was Callie did the right
[02:08:50] thing out there.
[02:08:52] On top of that, this was a good example of what the attitude of some Americans were
[02:08:57] it was at a World War II veteran went into an army recruiting office in Mobile, Alabama
[02:09:06] to make an extraordinary request.
[02:09:08] He had flown bombing missions over Germany which had killed innocent civilians and wanted
[02:09:13] to be arrested for war crimes.
[02:09:16] Despite, and another good example that somebody sent a goat, a Billy goat, a living
[02:09:22] Billy goat, and sent it to the White House and it had a jacket on and the jacket said,
[02:09:27] scapegoat on it.
[02:09:29] And this is pretty cool.
[02:09:32] The response that the army and the government had to this, Callie is not a scapegoat, nor
[02:09:37] a poor lieutenant single-out to bear the entire burden of a difficult war.
[02:09:44] It's clear to high level army memorandum circling amongst senior staff at the White House.
[02:09:50] His act stand alone and infamy among known atrocities for the US forces in the war.
[02:09:57] If Callie is let go or let off with a slap on the wrist, the message to all soldiers must
[02:10:02] read anything goes.
[02:10:05] The implications for the army let alone the nation are incalculable but clearly intolerable.
[02:10:14] So, they did hold the line and recognize that this was not good.
[02:10:24] At the same time, you still got these people that were saying that, look, this is the war.
[02:10:32] And here's a quote from the book, Take By Way of Example of the following.
[02:10:37] The American soldier in an officially sanctioned wrath is a thing so ugly and dangerous that
[02:10:44] it would take a kipling to describe him.
[02:10:48] Not a description of Me lie, but the observation of James H. Blunt a young lieutenant later
[02:10:54] to come later to become a judge on the behavior of troops in the Philippine 60 years before
[02:10:59] Vietnam.
[02:11:02] Here's another comment about what that war was like.
[02:11:05] The war and the Philippines are men have been relentless, have killed to exterminate men,
[02:11:11] women and children, prisoners and captives, active insurgents and suspected people from
[02:11:16] lads of 10 up and idea prevailing that the Filipino was little better than a dog.
[02:11:24] And another comparison here from the book, in the Dakotas, General William to come to Sherman
[02:11:32] had written to General Yuless, you, this is as grand.
[02:11:35] We must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sue, even to the extermination, men, women
[02:11:43] and children.
[02:11:44] Nothing else will reach the root of the case.
[02:11:46] Let's talk about the Indian wars there.
[02:11:50] And then another one, just a description that sort of explains how horrible war is.
[02:12:00] And this one was from World War II.
[02:12:02] What kind of a war to civilian suppose we fought anyways, we shot prisoners and cold blood,
[02:12:07] wiped out hospitals, strafed light, lifeboats, killed or mistreated enemy civilians, finished
[02:12:13] off the enemy wounded, tossed the dying into a hole with the dead.
[02:12:17] And in the Pacific, boiled the flesh off enemy skulls to make table ornaments for sweet
[02:12:21] hearts or carved their bones into letter openers.
[02:12:26] I was written by an American war correspondent, Edward L. Jones.
[02:12:35] Now, where those ideas become so disturbing and again, war is hell, war is dark or is evil,
[02:12:50] horrible things happen.
[02:12:57] And again, when you have a lack of leadership, things get even worse.
[02:13:01] And it can happen even to these apparently normal guys.
[02:13:08] And here's Michael Bernhardt talking about what it was like and what he fought of people
[02:13:14] after he got home.
[02:13:16] I had seen people who looked like everybody else, normal people doing atrocious things.
[02:13:22] And I really wasn't sure how anyone would have acted in the same situation.
[02:13:27] I thought I knew human nature.
[02:13:29] I thought that people were basically good and that they couldn't do this.
[02:13:32] I thought most of the values people held were pretty solid.
[02:13:36] That when we defined things as good or bad, that they were good or bad.
[02:13:42] And that we would know when something was really bad.
[02:13:45] But I had seen that this was not the case.
[02:13:49] I wasn't sure I could trust anyone again.
[02:13:51] I wasn't sure I could ever get close to anyone or confide in anyone very closely because
[02:13:56] of what I'd seen over there.
[02:14:00] And going back to the leadership piece, and this is from the book, what steps were taken
[02:14:06] to halt the run of beatings, thefts, rapes, tortures, and murder, which prodded Charlie
[02:14:12] Company down the road to me lie.
[02:14:16] None.
[02:14:18] Who, among the chain of command that found on its bottom wrongly tenant William Cally and
[02:14:23] rose through Medina, Barker, Henderson, and Costa gave any kind of moral leader example
[02:14:29] that might have prevented the moral destruction of the company.
[02:14:33] No one.
[02:14:36] In place of clear leadership, there was paper leadership.
[02:14:42] The rules of engagement, numerous codes of conduct, and all other directives, all of which
[02:14:47] contained valoftiest intentions.
[02:14:53] There was nothing wrong with these regulations.
[02:14:55] In spirit, they were a recognizable expression of the American ideal at war, a blueprint
[02:15:00] for order in the midst of hell.
[02:15:04] They simply never became part of the soldiers' reality because they weren't never seriously
[02:15:11] enforced.
[02:15:12] And without infatric enforcement, they corresponded as much to the world of the common
[02:15:16] grunt as road maps of Mars.
[02:15:24] That total lack of leadership, that lack of moral courage.
[02:15:39] And as we close this out, it goes in the book here and says, once again, the darker side
[02:15:46] of war has gone underground.
[02:15:49] Eli is no longer a public burden or concern, the burden of guilt and the burden of responsibility
[02:15:56] have fallen onto the soldiers themselves.
[02:16:01] Shit, that men of Charlie Company used to tell each other, rolls downhill.
[02:16:10] And we'll close out with the words from Vernado Simpson, who is in his own little private
[02:16:21] hell with his memories of this as he sits shaking from side to side in his chair, alone
[02:16:27] in his house in Jackson, Mississippi.
[02:16:32] How can you forgive?
[02:16:35] I can't forgive myself for the things.
[02:16:39] Even though I know that it was something that I was told to do, but how can I forget
[02:16:42] that or forgive?
[02:16:45] It's easy for you to say, well, go ahead with your life.
[02:16:50] But how can you go ahead with your life when this is holding you back?
[02:16:55] I can't put my mind to anything.
[02:16:58] Yes, I'm ashamed, I'm sorry, I'm guilty, but I did it.
[02:17:05] You know what else can I tell you.
[02:17:11] It happened.
[02:17:16] It happened.
[02:17:22] And as we think about this book and you should go and get this book and you should read
[02:17:32] this book and you should experience this.
[02:17:35] Level of darkness in the world so that we can all remember to be vigilant against this
[02:17:47] power of darkness, which I suppose we have to admit that that darkness is in every man's
[02:18:00] soul lurking and waiting for a moment to strike out.
[02:18:14] And we need to counter that.
[02:18:35] And you can see in these situations where leaders lead men to do things that they
[02:18:42] knew were wrong.
[02:18:44] They knew they were wrong.
[02:18:48] Things that they didn't want to do, killing children as tears are streaming down their
[02:18:54] faces.
[02:18:55] And if you can lead men to do things that they know are wrong, imagine the power and the
[02:19:01] influence you have as a leader to lead people to do things that are right and that people
[02:19:07] know are right and that are good.
[02:19:14] And you are a leader.
[02:19:18] I am a leader.
[02:19:19] No matter what your station in life or your position or your rank you are a leader when you
[02:19:26] step up and lead you are a leader.
[02:19:32] And you can make a difference and you can have an impact and you can affect the outcomes
[02:19:39] of so many things in the world by stepping up and leading away from the evil and away from
[02:19:54] the darkness and toward the light.
[02:20:09] And I know that was a rough book and it is a rough podcast.
[02:20:20] And I was questioning whether to actually do this or not.
[02:20:28] And at certain points when I was reading this, this is my fourth time reading it.
[02:20:33] I think and even when I was reading it just now on the podcast for this recording I could
[02:20:43] hear a numbness in my voice. I could hear it as I'm talking about the killing and the
[02:20:50] gunning down and it's so much.
[02:20:57] And I know it's going to be brutal.
[02:20:59] I know people are going to be impacted by this and maybe not everyone's going to make
[02:21:03] it through this and I understand that.
[02:21:08] And we owe it to ourselves to know history and to know and understand evil and to understand
[02:21:19] how quickly it can come about and to see these indicators and to know that if you're in the
[02:21:26] leadership position and you start to see things going sideways, you've got to put a stop
[02:21:29] to them before they get out of hand before they turn into this.
[02:21:38] Maybe at some point we'll look for some topics that are a little bit more I guess light
[02:21:51] hard and light harded.
[02:21:53] But I'll tell you the my only issue with that is you want a topic that's light
[02:21:56] harded you can find them anywhere.
[02:21:59] You can go get them anywhere.
[02:22:00] There's a whole actually there's a whole section for a podcast that's called comedy.
[02:22:06] Right?
[02:22:07] It's called comedy that exists.
[02:22:09] There's no section that says the darkness I guess there is one it's called jockel podcast.
[02:22:13] You want to hear about the darkness.
[02:22:14] You want to hear about things that are going on in the world that aren't good.
[02:22:17] This is it.
[02:22:18] And where the people that are dealing with reality and you know I know this is not for
[02:22:25] everybody and that's okay.
[02:22:28] That's okay.
[02:22:29] You know we're talking about heavy topics here and the reason we're talking about the
[02:22:35] dark is because we want to be enlightened.
[02:22:37] We want to know about these things.
[02:22:45] I don't think we're going to have time for Q&A because I just talked about that book for
[02:22:49] a really long time.
[02:22:54] So what we'll do is do a Q&A for the next podcast.
[02:22:59] For this one we'll let it stand on its own.
[02:23:08] And I know it might be a rough podcast to think about wanting to hear more of them.
[02:23:13] But if you do want to hear more of these podcasts echo what can these folks do to support
[02:23:20] the podcasts.
[02:23:21] Well, as I always recommend, sure support the podcast, but you can also support yourself.
[02:23:29] With supplementation on it has the best supplements, the actual supplements that I take.
[02:23:38] Jocquitakes on it.com slash jockel.
[02:23:42] You can get 10% off.
[02:23:44] So support yourself physically and financially in that way.
[02:23:49] I would recommend what do you think.
[02:23:51] Well, what's the number one you think?
[02:23:55] I think it depends on who you are.
[02:24:02] I think if you're me, it's cruel.
[02:24:05] Yeah, and they're just doing anyway.
[02:24:06] So Alphabran, good for you, brain, makes you think quicker.
[02:24:09] Makes you like, you know, you just say Alphabran because I got how soft I'm ready
[02:24:12] for it.
[02:24:13] As Jocquit drinks Alphabran instant by the way.
[02:24:17] Makes you think, you know, like when you search for words, like in your, you know, when
[02:24:20] you're trying to think of a word, sometimes.
[02:24:23] Yes.
[02:24:24] Well, you feel like you leave the pathways to the words a little bit closer.
[02:24:28] Yeah.
[02:24:29] Yeah.
[02:24:30] If you want to get it, you actually can read all about it.
[02:24:31] It's called a neutral pick Alphabran.
[02:24:33] Yes.
[02:24:34] Good for you, brain.
[02:24:35] Anyway, cruel oil, good for you, joins us when Jocquitakes.
[02:24:38] That's why he's so functional.
[02:24:40] I would say, relax a bit at our professional.
[02:24:43] I like that word.
[02:24:46] And warrior bars.
[02:24:48] That's the new one right there, the warrior bars.
[02:24:50] That's not like some, you know, they've been having, well, actually,
[02:24:54] it's pretty neat too, but you know, you have protein powder.
[02:24:56] That's been around.
[02:24:57] But warrior bar, that's a new twist on things.
[02:25:00] Well, what's good about, what's good about, like you talk about protein
[02:25:02] powder?
[02:25:03] That's like a powder, right?
[02:25:04] Or you get a protein bar.
[02:25:05] That's a thing that's been manufactured.
[02:25:07] Right.
[02:25:08] Like a power.
[02:25:09] Yeah.
[02:25:10] The warrior bar is like food.
[02:25:11] Yeah.
[02:25:12] Yeah.
[02:25:13] So that makes it a little bit better in my mind.
[02:25:15] Yes.
[02:25:16] Because I want to make food.
[02:25:17] Yeah.
[02:25:18] So it's kind of like in the direction of a beef jerky situation, but even more.
[02:25:23] Anyway, look, look at it.
[02:25:24] The thing is, well, there's two, there's two major differences between beef jerky
[02:25:27] and warrior bar.
[02:25:28] And that is beef jerky dry.
[02:25:31] Warrior bar, not dry.
[02:25:32] Yeah.
[02:25:33] That's the list.
[02:25:34] And then a shrimp tech, good for like high intensity kind of prolong stuff.
[02:25:39] Gigiitsu, if you're into it wrestling, metcon, metcon, metcon, or.
[02:25:43] You're in a crossfit.
[02:25:44] There you go.
[02:25:45] A shrimp tech boom.
[02:25:46] Yeah.
[02:25:47] Improve your output, your performance.
[02:25:49] Utilize oxygen better.
[02:25:51] Anyway, it's really good.
[02:25:53] It's like really good.
[02:25:54] Also another way to support the podcast if you're in the mood to.
[02:25:57] Before you do your Amazon shopping, go to japkopadcast.com and click on the Amazon link.
[02:26:02] What is that cost you?
[02:26:04] That doesn't cost you anything except for literally, literally, three seconds.
[02:26:08] So you're in time.
[02:26:09] Three seconds and you support the podcast.
[02:26:11] Yep.
[02:26:12] I like that.
[02:26:13] And one like a click.
[02:26:14] Maybe like a one tenth of a calorie.
[02:26:15] Maybe you finger click.
[02:26:16] I like that.
[02:26:17] But yeah, super easy.
[02:26:18] The main thing is we're asking people to donate money there.
[02:26:21] No, no, no.
[02:26:22] We just Amazon's gonna donate the money.
[02:26:24] Yeah.
[02:26:25] They're gonna support the podcast.
[02:26:27] Like, collect it.
[02:26:28] Yeah, it's good.
[02:26:29] So boom, there you go.
[02:26:31] I guess the main thing is to remember to do it.
[02:26:35] You know, when you're trying to get that duct tape real quick, oh, I got to make that
[02:26:37] time so you can ship that same day.
[02:26:40] You know, then you got to just want it.
[02:26:42] Maybe take some alpha brain that'll help you remember.
[02:26:44] I like that.
[02:26:45] Anyway.
[02:26:46] You want some jocos stuff, like some cool shirts, jocosdoor.com.
[02:26:50] Now this, I'm seeing a new shirt.
[02:26:52] Is that correct here?
[02:26:53] Yes, we have a new shirt, the trooper shirt.
[02:26:56] That's, it's got a name.
[02:26:58] Are we naming shirts now?
[02:26:59] Because the guy is over there.
[02:27:01] We have to name it.
[02:27:02] So this is some people don't echo Charles.
[02:27:06] He is an artist, right?
[02:27:08] He's an artist.
[02:27:10] And so that's why he has to name the t-shirt.
[02:27:13] Yeah.
[02:27:14] You know, you just have to name it because that makes you feel like it's a piece.
[02:27:16] It's a piece of art.
[02:27:17] Because you just said the trooper shirt.
[02:27:22] As if that's the thing.
[02:27:24] But here's the thing, though, with this shirt and with all the shirts, it's not just,
[02:27:28] oh, I'm going to call it the trooper shirt because I think that sounds cool.
[02:27:31] It's like there's different lace, not just a shirt with a saying line.
[02:27:33] Like this blue equals.
[02:27:34] It's not just your saying.
[02:27:35] It's not just called the trooper t-shirt.
[02:27:37] It actually is the trooper shirt.
[02:27:39] Yeah.
[02:27:40] Like where you're coming.
[02:27:41] And you're wearing it right now.
[02:27:42] If you want to see the side of you too, you can check it out.
[02:27:45] But three colors, that's a unique one.
[02:27:47] Usually you have two colors.
[02:27:48] Normally I would protest something like that.
[02:27:50] No, but you can't protest it and this is why.
[02:27:52] So the people who signed up on the insider's group, the email list, I, people that
[02:28:00] are enlisted troopers.
[02:28:01] You know, of Jockel podcast.
[02:28:02] Thanks, guys.
[02:28:03] Yeah, it's all.
[02:28:04] Well, how do they do that?
[02:28:06] Well, on JockelStore.com, Ryan the front, you just put your email address.
[02:28:10] And I don't spam.
[02:28:11] That's not what it's for.
[02:28:12] This is what it's for.
[02:28:13] The things that it was for and the people who are on the list know this.
[02:28:17] Where hey, I got a new shirt design idea, you know, I don't know what colors really
[02:28:25] did.
[02:28:26] What are the best colors, right?
[02:28:27] I know what colors I like.
[02:28:28] Yeah, I'll do a black one.
[02:28:30] I'll do.
[02:28:31] But so what I did was I sent an email to everybody and said, what, here's the design.
[02:28:36] Here's what it kind of will look like.
[02:28:37] What color shirts are we doing?
[02:28:39] What color shirts do you guys like?
[02:28:40] So there's a, there was a vote that was input received.
[02:28:43] Yes, yeah, like a, yeah, and a consensus was these three colors.
[02:28:47] It's like a dark red.
[02:28:49] Oh, which actually turned out even better than I thought.
[02:28:52] And I was enthusiastic about the red and the OD green support OD green.
[02:28:58] That way if you have to, you never know when you might have to go tactical.
[02:29:02] It is tactical.
[02:29:03] I'm into doing purpose things.
[02:29:05] Things that can be good for normal situations or tactical situations.
[02:29:10] That's why like OD green t-shirts.
[02:29:12] Yeah, just in case you get a spring into getting after it.
[02:29:15] Spontaneous.
[02:29:16] And then of course we got the black, but that was the consensus overall.
[02:29:19] The green.
[02:29:20] There was a charcoal head of strong, strong, you know.
[02:29:24] But the, the, the green, the red and the black.
[02:29:27] But anyway, yeah, it's a cool one.
[02:29:29] Check it out if you want to look at the details of it.
[02:29:31] They're, yeah, they're good.
[02:29:33] Anyway, if you want to support the podcast that way, get a shirt.
[02:29:36] This trooper shirt isn't the only one.
[02:29:38] But man, I, I'm pretty, I'm pretty fired up about it.
[02:29:42] It looks good.
[02:29:43] I think.
[02:29:44] Anyway, there's other ones on there too that are cool.
[02:29:47] And coffee mugs and stickers.
[02:29:50] If you're down.
[02:29:51] I like that.
[02:29:52] That's the way.
[02:29:53] Those are the ways.
[02:29:54] And for the people who have been and do, thank to say thank you would be like, not even
[02:30:01] doing it halfway just this.
[02:30:03] Yeah, definitely thanks everyone for doing that.
[02:30:06] And you know, you know what's weird.
[02:30:08] You always talk about like how, oh, you go to see the, you got to see the dark to, to appreciate
[02:30:13] the light, right?
[02:30:15] I actually just because we just got done with that dark, dark darkness of a book in just
[02:30:22] having a conversation right now.
[02:30:23] I'm so happy.
[02:30:24] Right.
[02:30:25] Just to be like here and talking and we're, we're selling some cool t shirts and drinking
[02:30:31] some just to be just in this situation.
[02:30:35] And know that we have this goodness around us is, uh, is really good.
[02:30:40] So I think it is worth venturing into the dark so that you can appreciate the light.
[02:30:46] If you want to hear more of this kind of things, obviously you got the podcast.
[02:30:51] You can also pick up a book written by myself and my brother, Lave Babin.
[02:30:56] It's called Extreme Ownership.
[02:30:59] You can buy the book or you can buy the audio book, which is actually Lave and I reading
[02:31:02] it.
[02:31:03] You'll get some more information in there and that's everything I talk about is, is in
[02:31:09] that book.
[02:31:10] I mean, that's, that's, it's the basic principles of combat leadership that we put
[02:31:13] in there.
[02:31:14] Let me add one thing about, it's, it's extreme, that book, extreme ownership.
[02:31:20] It's good.
[02:31:21] It's like dang.
[02:31:22] This is, you fit a lot of the, everyone's different.
[02:31:23] But me, I felt like more than adult after like incorporating these, like the, but
[02:31:29] here's the thing that you do take away is the people around you will notice that you're
[02:31:34] a, like, better person to be around.
[02:31:37] And I thought I was like pretty nice anyway, but you'll feel people like gravitating
[02:31:42] towards you more because like any abrasion, and everyone has varying levels of abrasiveness
[02:31:47] in them.
[02:31:48] Even if it's just a teeny tiny little bit, everyone has some.
[02:31:51] But what that does, it, it, it makes you work with people in a way less abrasive way.
[02:31:59] So people want to be around you when things go now.
[02:32:03] I would say that's, that's a very good assessment.
[02:32:07] And I'll tell you that I always felt, especially when I was in the, when I was in the military,
[02:32:12] in the seal teams, when, when I was doing something, people wanted to come with me.
[02:32:17] I know.
[02:32:18] Yeah, it was all good.
[02:32:19] We all wanted to get after it together.
[02:32:20] Yeah.
[02:32:21] So that's probably an indicator of the principles in the book at work in my life.
[02:32:27] Yeah.
[02:32:28] And some people, I mean, I don't know, maybe us whatever, where, you know, you'll have
[02:32:33] a little, small little conflict or a little something, little friction with somebody.
[02:32:40] Confident.
[02:32:41] Maybe I'll work or even at home or whatever.
[02:32:44] I would say it's, it's pretty rare.
[02:32:46] Like, I'm not, like, if there was some friction that came up between me and anyone,
[02:32:50] even at my friend, my wife or something, he would stand out so much nowadays.
[02:32:54] Yeah.
[02:32:55] It's got become a better person.
[02:32:58] Yeah.
[02:32:59] You become a better person.
[02:33:00] Yeah, and that's at the end, but like I said, it's like, if you, if you follow it, if you
[02:33:06] are like, dang, I value this and I'm going to actually incorporate it.
[02:33:12] As time goes on, that's how it is where if you get friction or some adversarial situation,
[02:33:18] even if it's not yours, you're like, dang, I see that from a mile away, and it sticks out.
[02:33:24] So it's not, I mean, some people, it's part of their everyday thing.
[02:33:27] Yeah, no, no.
[02:33:28] It's road rage or I don't know anything.
[02:33:30] Yeah.
[02:33:31] But it's, yeah, it's good, man.
[02:33:32] It's good like that.
[02:33:33] Well, thanks.
[02:33:34] Appreciate it.
[02:33:35] Check it out.
[02:33:36] You can get it on Amazon after you click through the website.
[02:33:39] You know, closing it up, everybody, if you want to talk to us more beyond that, you can
[02:33:47] get us on the, in a web's, Echo's ad echo Charles.
[02:33:50] I am at Jocca Willink, that's on Twitter, the Facebookie, and even have a little bit of
[02:33:56] the Instagram going on.
[02:33:59] I actually, I actually answer most of the, well, I actually, every single thing that comes
[02:34:03] on Twitter, I will respond to.
[02:34:05] I'm going to see how long I can keep that up for.
[02:34:07] I don't know how long it's going to last.
[02:34:08] It's getting pretty hard core right now.
[02:34:12] But I'm definitely reading everything that's coming in and we appreciate all the feedback
[02:34:17] we get from you guys and you guys bring it a little light to our world as much appreciated.
[02:34:23] And thanks for bringing that light to us and most of all, thanks for going out there and
[02:34:33] getting after it.
[02:34:35] And so until next time, this is Echo and Jockel.
