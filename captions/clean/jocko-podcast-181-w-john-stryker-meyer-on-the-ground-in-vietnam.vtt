00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.62
This is Jocco Podcast number 181.

2
00:00:03.62 --> 00:00:06.92
With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willing.

3
00:00:06.92 --> 00:00:07.92
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:07.92 --> 00:00:09.76
Good evening.

5
00:00:09.76 --> 00:00:11.52
Gidey Mal.

6
00:00:11.52 --> 00:00:15.40
We were in Cambodia alone with no fixed wing aircraft.

7
00:00:15.40 --> 00:00:17.52
Sal's eyes were as big as saucers.

8
00:00:17.52 --> 00:00:20.80
I told Bubba to give me a claymore mine with a five second fuse.

9
00:00:20.80 --> 00:00:24.52
I gave Bubba and fuck the move quick signal.

10
00:00:24.52 --> 00:00:29.14
As we move back to the LZ, I stated the rear of the formation with sal and hastily

11
00:00:29.14 --> 00:00:31.78
covering our tracks.

12
00:00:31.78 --> 00:00:37.66
We'd only gone a short distance when sal hissed, Bo-Ku-V-C, Bo-Ku-V-C.

13
00:00:37.66 --> 00:00:42.18
I could see the pit helmets in the distance coming from the south.

14
00:00:42.18 --> 00:00:47.16
I radioed the green Hornets, CNC helicopter, and told them to return with their gunships

15
00:00:47.16 --> 00:00:51.58
and to pick us up at the primary LZ-ASAP.

16
00:00:51.58 --> 00:00:56.78
CNC said they'd have assets on-site in 10 minutes or less.

17
00:00:56.78 --> 00:01:00.30
Now even 10 minutes seem like a long time.

18
00:01:00.30 --> 00:01:07.74
Tuan and I fired our M79 as two high bursts which slowed the NVA down for a few seconds.

19
00:01:07.74 --> 00:01:13.24
Sal opened fire, shooting single-shot and moving backwards no longer bothering to cover

20
00:01:13.24 --> 00:01:14.84
our tracks.

21
00:01:14.84 --> 00:01:18.54
I yelled to Bubba to move out at double time.

22
00:01:18.54 --> 00:01:21.54
The race for life was on.

23
00:01:21.54 --> 00:01:24.94
Sal and sal hissed to hip and pointed north.

24
00:01:24.94 --> 00:01:26.22
Damn.

25
00:01:26.22 --> 00:01:32.62
They were pith helmets and NVA uniforms coming at us from the north too.

26
00:01:32.62 --> 00:01:36.26
And at a dead run.

27
00:01:36.26 --> 00:01:40.90
Sal and I placed a clay more behind a tree, pulled the fuse lighter and ran.

28
00:01:40.90 --> 00:01:44.22
The NVA were now running and shooting wildly.

29
00:01:44.22 --> 00:01:47.66
We sprinted to catch up to the team as the clay more exploded.

30
00:01:47.66 --> 00:01:51.54
The NVA kept on charging.

31
00:01:51.54 --> 00:01:57.18
How quickly placed it's clay more in front of a tree and ran while Tuan and I provided

32
00:01:57.18 --> 00:01:59.46
covering fire.

33
00:01:59.46 --> 00:02:04.02
We sprinted toward our team as the second clay more detonated.

34
00:02:04.02 --> 00:02:07.30
We felt the blast on our backs as we ran.

35
00:02:07.30 --> 00:02:14.46
As folk and Bubba pushed toward the LZ-Hip Tuan, sal and I fired back using the immediate

36
00:02:14.46 --> 00:02:19.70
action drills the entire team had practiced for hours on end.

37
00:02:19.70 --> 00:02:22.98
Ons M79 rounds were deadly effective.

38
00:02:22.98 --> 00:02:28.38
Those combined with my M79 rounds and the car 15 fire from hip and sal temporarily

39
00:02:28.38 --> 00:02:33.54
started stalled the hard charging NVA troops.

40
00:02:33.54 --> 00:02:38.98
We reached the LZ quickly and compares into how cautiously we had exited it.

41
00:02:38.98 --> 00:02:44.06
As the team set up a hasty perimeter, hit placed another clay more in the path of the NVA

42
00:02:44.06 --> 00:02:47.18
that were charging us from the south.

43
00:02:47.18 --> 00:02:52.98
To the north, Bubba rigged to clay more with a contact detonator on a trip wire.

44
00:02:52.98 --> 00:02:59.38
As the tide of Pith helmets flowed toward us, Bubba and I opened fire with our M79s and

45
00:02:59.38 --> 00:03:04.70
sal and hip opened up on full auto with their car 15s.

46
00:03:04.70 --> 00:03:10.62
More NVA emerged from the smoke of the M79 high explosive rounds and tripped Bubba's clay

47
00:03:10.62 --> 00:03:12.34
more.

48
00:03:12.34 --> 00:03:15.78
That's when the first green Hornet gunship arrived.

49
00:03:15.78 --> 00:03:21.06
I popped a smoke canister and directed a gun run to the west of our perimeter.

50
00:03:21.06 --> 00:03:27.34
Within seconds the gunship roared in front of our perimeter, shredding the NVA ranks, slowing

51
00:03:27.34 --> 00:03:30.26
them down for a few seconds.

52
00:03:30.26 --> 00:03:33.06
The green Hornet's fire power was incredible.

53
00:03:33.06 --> 00:03:38.38
Finally, the green Hornet slick that inserted us into the target area arrived on the

54
00:03:38.38 --> 00:03:43.82
LZ as close to our position as possible with his left door facing us, the nose pointing

55
00:03:43.82 --> 00:03:46.90
north or north west.

56
00:03:46.90 --> 00:03:50.14
Fortunately the Air Force had made it to us in less than 10 minutes.

57
00:03:50.14 --> 00:03:53.18
The relentless NVA kept coming after us.

58
00:03:53.18 --> 00:03:58.98
As Tuan and I each unleashed one more M79 high explosive round at the NVA, Bubba led the

59
00:03:58.98 --> 00:04:01.46
team toward the Air Force Huey.

60
00:04:01.46 --> 00:04:05.62
We always had an American lead the team's approach to an American helicopter to avoid any

61
00:04:05.62 --> 00:04:10.86
confusion in regard to South Vietnamese team members on STIDO.

62
00:04:10.86 --> 00:04:16.38
I fired the last claymore as the wave of NVA troops got in front of it.

63
00:04:16.38 --> 00:04:26.74
The last claymore blast gave me a few precious seconds to make it to the Huey.

64
00:04:26.74 --> 00:04:36.30
And that right there is another glimpse into the insanity that John Strykermeyer,

65
00:04:36.30 --> 00:04:43.30
known as Tilt, lived through as a special forces soldier in Vietnam, a recon team leader

66
00:04:43.30 --> 00:04:48.54
from Mac Vsog, studies and observation group command and control.

67
00:04:48.54 --> 00:04:53.62
And if you have not listened to podcast 180 yet, then go listen to it.

68
00:04:53.62 --> 00:05:00.86
Tilt was on that podcast and as he walked out of the studio, I knew that I needed him

69
00:05:00.86 --> 00:05:03.06
to come back as quickly as possible.

70
00:05:03.06 --> 00:05:10.54
But I asked him and he graciously agreed and here he is, once again, John Strykermeyer,

71
00:05:10.54 --> 00:05:14.10
Tilt, good evening sir, good evening.

72
00:05:14.10 --> 00:05:20.34
Yeah, you know, you kind of mentioned that that one operation right there when you

73
00:05:20.34 --> 00:05:24.66
were out there facing three divisions.

74
00:05:24.66 --> 00:05:28.58
After you got fat dumb and happy on Thanksgiving day with a big meal, then you guys rolled

75
00:05:28.58 --> 00:05:29.98
out of the field, right?

76
00:05:29.98 --> 00:05:30.98
Indeed.

77
00:05:30.98 --> 00:05:34.50
And then, so how did that operation go now?

78
00:05:34.50 --> 00:05:35.94
You guys got inserted?

79
00:05:35.94 --> 00:05:40.38
How did you end up in that situation where you're running away, putting five second

80
00:05:40.38 --> 00:05:42.50
fused claymores facing the enemy?

81
00:05:42.50 --> 00:05:44.30
What was, how did what led up to that?

82
00:05:44.30 --> 00:05:52.18
Well, we had a briefing in the night before and they were hyper concerned because of three

83
00:05:52.18 --> 00:05:56.50
NVA divisions, 30,000 men were MIA, Lily.

84
00:05:56.50 --> 00:06:00.74
And the CIA, DIA, whoever else is out there had lost contact.

85
00:06:00.74 --> 00:06:08.98
So that night, myself and the CO and S3 went over the maps, Liz reports, all the intel reports.

86
00:06:08.98 --> 00:06:10.58
We were up until after midnight.

87
00:06:10.58 --> 00:06:16.46
So they came to you and said, hey, we're missing 30,000 men, three divisions of NVA.

88
00:06:16.46 --> 00:06:20.18
The first, the third, and the other side of the CIA, look in, we've got the DIA, we've got

89
00:06:20.18 --> 00:06:22.14
spy planes and all that stuff.

90
00:06:22.14 --> 00:06:23.86
We can't find them, so then they come to you.

91
00:06:23.86 --> 00:06:24.86
Yeah.

92
00:06:24.86 --> 00:06:28.38
Okay, and you're like, oh, we got this.

93
00:06:28.38 --> 00:06:32.54
Well, yeah, and at the time, I was still a spec 4 and E4.

94
00:06:32.54 --> 00:06:34.82
And I hadn't met the CO yet.

95
00:06:34.82 --> 00:06:38.06
So the first thing was, he looks at me, he says, you're an E4.

96
00:06:38.06 --> 00:06:40.74
This is an E80 9 billet, what WTF?

97
00:06:40.74 --> 00:06:45.06
I go look sir, long story short, I said, look, I've run a bunch of missions up north, we're

98
00:06:45.06 --> 00:06:47.18
here at TDY, how can I help you?

99
00:06:47.18 --> 00:06:48.18
And he settled down.

100
00:06:48.18 --> 00:06:51.14
We looked, then we were up all night looking at those intel reports.

101
00:06:51.14 --> 00:06:55.70
And then they also had pictures that were from 70,000 feet, we had never seen anything

102
00:06:55.70 --> 00:06:56.86
like them.

103
00:06:56.86 --> 00:07:05.10
My mom was the piano teacher and one of her students, dad, worked on lenses for aircraft

104
00:07:05.10 --> 00:07:07.46
to shoot from 70,000 feet.

105
00:07:07.46 --> 00:07:09.66
He talked to me about Mazi, young kid.

106
00:07:09.66 --> 00:07:11.22
I go, that's really cool.

107
00:07:11.22 --> 00:07:15.38
Well, now I knew what it was working on and why he couldn't really talk about it much.

108
00:07:15.38 --> 00:07:19.90
But that was the first time the SRS 71s were used over flights.

109
00:07:19.90 --> 00:07:20.90
Got it.

110
00:07:20.90 --> 00:07:21.90
I said, where did he come from?

111
00:07:21.90 --> 00:07:27.22
Because I was like, this is mind-bottom, and you used to see little pictures close by

112
00:07:27.22 --> 00:07:32.58
people smiling, but from 70,000 feet, we had a good estimate as to where did he have

113
00:07:32.58 --> 00:07:33.58
to be?

114
00:07:33.58 --> 00:07:36.10
And they said, we can't tell you this stuff shut up, you don't have to have them seen

115
00:07:36.10 --> 00:07:37.10
it.

116
00:07:37.10 --> 00:07:40.38
And so we put it all together, just try this area.

117
00:07:40.38 --> 00:07:44.66
I mean, we're only only going to ground this short while maybe an hour or so.

118
00:07:44.66 --> 00:07:46.94
And then, oh, help, bro clues.

119
00:07:46.94 --> 00:07:50.98
And did you, did you, you stumbled upon their camp or like a camp that they had recently

120
00:07:50.98 --> 00:07:51.98
left?

121
00:07:51.98 --> 00:07:55.78
Yeah, well, they had, they would have waste stations a long way.

122
00:07:55.78 --> 00:08:00.34
And so we walked into them before we found some, but never would fire as burning.

123
00:08:00.34 --> 00:08:02.82
The ones still had a poth on it.

124
00:08:02.82 --> 00:08:10.10
And so, when we got back, sound, the guys estimated that one division had just left,

125
00:08:10.10 --> 00:08:14.42
and their point there, their tail on was what came back at us.

126
00:08:14.42 --> 00:08:19.18
And the other, from the north was just moving into the base camp, a little sandwich.

127
00:08:19.18 --> 00:08:20.18
Yeah.

128
00:08:20.18 --> 00:08:21.18
Little NVA sandwich.

129
00:08:21.18 --> 00:08:22.18
There we go.

130
00:08:22.18 --> 00:08:23.18
We were to, we were to belong.

131
00:08:23.18 --> 00:08:25.66
You're a basic balloon.

132
00:08:25.66 --> 00:08:26.66
Yeah.

133
00:08:26.66 --> 00:08:33.62
Did you go into that one real heavy in terms of, is that, because I, if I remember correctly

134
00:08:33.62 --> 00:08:38.82
from the book, how common was it that you carried the five second fuses on the claim

135
00:08:38.82 --> 00:08:39.82
wars?

136
00:08:39.82 --> 00:08:44.62
Well, we started doing that at month earlier, earlier part of November, I mean, because

137
00:08:44.62 --> 00:08:49.98
we had a couple of targets where the numbers were just incredible when they came out.

138
00:08:49.98 --> 00:08:52.34
So I always wanted to have those just in case.

139
00:08:52.34 --> 00:08:59.50
So here we took a few extra fuses, you know, John had his fuses and, uh, sal and fuck,

140
00:08:59.50 --> 00:09:01.58
they all knew how to work those.

141
00:09:01.58 --> 00:09:07.78
And so, um, here I said, because we saw how open the area was, we were used to triple

142
00:09:07.78 --> 00:09:13.06
canopy up north. So now we're in Cambodia. You could see three or four hundred yards away,

143
00:09:13.06 --> 00:09:17.86
maybe five hundred yards, WTF times two, and then you see the fifth-ounce run, and that

144
00:09:17.86 --> 00:09:23.58
you, it's like, how did that feel when you see the NVA in an open run towards your position?

145
00:09:23.58 --> 00:09:24.58
That poured arms.

146
00:09:24.58 --> 00:09:25.58
Yeah.

147
00:09:25.58 --> 00:09:26.58
Good Lord.

148
00:09:26.58 --> 00:09:28.86
It was, it was an experience that I'll take it to the grave with me.

149
00:09:28.86 --> 00:09:30.02
That's a nightmare.

150
00:09:30.02 --> 00:09:31.30
Is your worst one.

151
00:09:31.30 --> 00:09:35.90
How, how, how did you, did you, did you, did you in a situation like that?

152
00:09:35.90 --> 00:09:41.82
You're, you've got, I mean, thousands of potentially thousands of enemy soldiers.

153
00:09:41.82 --> 00:09:45.18
Some of them are booze blatantly running towards your position.

154
00:09:45.18 --> 00:09:46.86
What are you thinking in the back of your mind?

155
00:09:46.86 --> 00:09:50.58
Are you thinking, hey, we're not going to get out of this?

156
00:09:50.58 --> 00:09:55.58
Or are you just, I know for me, in my, my experiences, which are nothing, close to that.

157
00:09:55.58 --> 00:09:57.62
But I was always just thinking about getting my job done.

158
00:09:57.62 --> 00:09:59.50
Like, okay, this is, well, this is the best thing I can do right now.

159
00:09:59.50 --> 00:10:00.74
Hey, we need to put some people over here.

160
00:10:00.74 --> 00:10:02.38
Let's get some machine gunners up on the roof.

161
00:10:02.38 --> 00:10:06.18
I would never get to a point where I was, well, maybe I didn't have enough time or I wasn't

162
00:10:06.18 --> 00:10:09.58
smart enough to think about what big consequences were coming.

163
00:10:09.58 --> 00:10:15.06
But when you see, when you see those helmets running towards you at poor garms, you got

164
00:10:15.06 --> 00:10:18.70
to be thinking, this isn't looking real good for, this isn't looking real good for a tilt

165
00:10:18.70 --> 00:10:19.70
in the boy.

166
00:10:19.70 --> 00:10:24.62
Well, no, I had my first Jacob moment, which was the good news is we found these fuckers.

167
00:10:24.62 --> 00:10:27.38
The bad news is they're coming to kill my ass.

168
00:10:27.38 --> 00:10:29.38
Oh, really?

169
00:10:29.38 --> 00:10:32.94
Really, it's like, well, I've played with did our homework last night.

170
00:10:32.94 --> 00:10:34.14
This really worked out well.

171
00:10:34.14 --> 00:10:35.90
Maybe a little bit too well.

172
00:10:35.90 --> 00:10:37.50
And just thank God for the green hornets.

173
00:10:37.50 --> 00:10:39.02
May I, they didn't get back there.

174
00:10:39.02 --> 00:10:40.98
They're just only a question of time.

175
00:10:40.98 --> 00:10:46.30
And they could, you would keep them on station, generally, like, for, like, 10 or 15 minutes.

176
00:10:46.30 --> 00:10:47.30
Well, this is Cambodian.

177
00:10:47.30 --> 00:10:48.90
Everything was different there.

178
00:10:48.90 --> 00:10:52.74
First we had no, no fix wings.

179
00:10:52.74 --> 00:10:54.82
All we had was the helicopters.

180
00:10:54.82 --> 00:10:57.26
But they were green horns, air force.

181
00:10:57.26 --> 00:11:04.10
At that point in time, November 68, they were, they had to stay to the art, Huey,

182
00:11:04.10 --> 00:11:05.74
stay with the fastest.

183
00:11:05.74 --> 00:11:08.30
They could carry more loads and their miniguns.

184
00:11:08.30 --> 00:11:13.38
I think they had mounted miniguns that they could handle manually.

185
00:11:13.38 --> 00:11:15.38
Some of the early ones we saw were mounted.

186
00:11:15.38 --> 00:11:19.74
And so the helicopter would have limited maneuverability.

187
00:11:19.74 --> 00:11:23.10
But the one the air force was just really on top of the game.

188
00:11:23.10 --> 00:11:24.90
Well, that's what came in.

189
00:11:24.90 --> 00:11:27.62
And when they came in with their minigun runs, I really bought us a couple of

190
00:11:27.62 --> 00:11:29.34
available seconds.

191
00:11:29.34 --> 00:11:31.34
Seconds.

192
00:11:31.34 --> 00:11:32.98
They were common.

193
00:11:32.98 --> 00:11:33.98
And you could see them.

194
00:11:33.98 --> 00:11:37.86
It's just like, and I was looking at some pictures of you yesterday.

195
00:11:37.86 --> 00:11:40.42
And you guys still had 20 round mags.

196
00:11:40.42 --> 00:11:41.42
Oh, yeah.

197
00:11:41.42 --> 00:11:44.94
Which you'd load out to 18 rounds because you didn't want to compress this spring too much

198
00:11:44.94 --> 00:11:45.94
and cause a jam.

199
00:11:45.94 --> 00:11:46.94
Right.

200
00:11:46.94 --> 00:11:49.54
And we would have run over your mother to get one of those 30 round jobs.

201
00:11:49.54 --> 00:11:50.54
Yeah.

202
00:11:50.54 --> 00:11:51.54
Man.

203
00:11:51.54 --> 00:11:53.54
Oh, yeah.

204
00:11:53.54 --> 00:11:55.18
It was different.

205
00:11:55.18 --> 00:11:59.14
So we always had at least 600 plus rounds all in the magazines that a couple

206
00:11:59.14 --> 00:12:03.06
of extra band all year as just in case.

207
00:12:03.06 --> 00:12:06.74
And you guys did make it out that time obviously.

208
00:12:06.74 --> 00:12:08.38
Well, yeah.

209
00:12:08.38 --> 00:12:12.14
And then you know, here too, when we left the chopper pulls out and has been

210
00:12:12.14 --> 00:12:16.86
lifting off, the NVA come out of the jungle, the thin jungle, and it was muddy.

211
00:12:16.86 --> 00:12:18.90
He had rained a day before.

212
00:12:18.90 --> 00:12:23.50
And these guys are coming out there at Port Arms and they're trying to stop.

213
00:12:23.50 --> 00:12:28.26
And the mud comes up from their boots as they're trying to stop, come down to Port Arms.

214
00:12:28.26 --> 00:12:32.94
So me and the door gun are just, and I forget if it's sour, fuck, we're just getting

215
00:12:32.94 --> 00:12:37.18
these guys and they just stop like a cartoon and they go back.

216
00:12:37.18 --> 00:12:38.18
This is what happened.

217
00:12:38.18 --> 00:12:42.18
And just blue these guys back into mud from their boots is going up into the props

218
00:12:42.18 --> 00:12:43.74
as they're trying to stop.

219
00:12:43.74 --> 00:12:46.62
And they hit them and they just go back into the jungle and then we got the hell out of

220
00:12:46.62 --> 00:12:47.62
there.

221
00:12:47.62 --> 00:12:52.14
It strikes me as strange because as I keep reading about the NVA, well, I mean, we know

222
00:12:52.14 --> 00:12:55.22
that these, you know, this is an insurgency.

223
00:12:55.22 --> 00:12:58.82
These guys are looking to not fight when they don't have to, right?

224
00:12:58.82 --> 00:13:03.26
That's why it always surprises me in your stories how determined they were.

225
00:13:03.26 --> 00:13:06.70
Like those guys, hey, look, okay, the Americans, they're getting on the helicopter, we'll

226
00:13:06.70 --> 00:13:08.02
let them go, whatever.

227
00:13:08.02 --> 00:13:10.06
We'll come back next time.

228
00:13:10.06 --> 00:13:11.86
You know, we don't want to die right today because we don't have to.

229
00:13:11.86 --> 00:13:12.86
We can wait.

230
00:13:12.86 --> 00:13:13.86
We can wait 10 years.

231
00:13:13.86 --> 00:13:14.86
We can wait 20 years.

232
00:13:14.86 --> 00:13:16.18
We're going to be here forever.

233
00:13:16.18 --> 00:13:19.38
For them to have that kind of determination where they were just common and common

234
00:13:19.38 --> 00:13:24.82
and like you said on the last podcast, literally stacking up bodies so they could get you.

235
00:13:24.82 --> 00:13:29.74
That would have been just a crown jewel to capture a little special forces team.

236
00:13:29.74 --> 00:13:30.74
Oh, yeah.

237
00:13:30.74 --> 00:13:32.86
I mean, they had to kill American award.

238
00:13:32.86 --> 00:13:37.70
So if they, if they confirmed that they killed one of us or got the body of a dead body,

239
00:13:37.70 --> 00:13:41.78
they would get their killed in American award and they would get a bonus of some sort

240
00:13:41.78 --> 00:13:48.82
and maybe world heroes up north for the rest of their lives.

241
00:13:48.82 --> 00:13:49.82
Awesome.

242
00:13:49.82 --> 00:13:54.94
Okay, so that book and we talked about it on the last podcast and I said it last time.

243
00:13:54.94 --> 00:13:57.66
We touched less than 10% of the book.

244
00:13:57.66 --> 00:14:03.50
The stories are completely insane and you can get that book on Amazon.

245
00:14:03.50 --> 00:14:05.42
But you've written, that's not the only book you've written.

246
00:14:05.42 --> 00:14:06.42
You've written another one.

247
00:14:06.42 --> 00:14:14.18
Another book is called On the Ground and this book, again, it's just the same level

248
00:14:14.18 --> 00:14:19.58
of insanity, the feel strange for me to be sitting here talking to you because every time

249
00:14:19.58 --> 00:14:23.90
I read one of your stories, I'm like, how's this guy making it out of this?

250
00:14:23.90 --> 00:14:27.42
There's, you kick this one off with an interesting story.

251
00:14:27.42 --> 00:14:31.54
These guys, one of the, it's, you're not with them, but it's a recon team on the ground,

252
00:14:31.54 --> 00:14:33.70
a guy named Watkins is in charge.

253
00:14:33.70 --> 00:14:35.06
Pat Watkins.

254
00:14:35.06 --> 00:14:41.30
And they're set up on a road and they're doing a recon and I think they set up an ambush

255
00:14:41.30 --> 00:14:44.38
too, like a judge, an ambush to take out some troops.

256
00:14:44.38 --> 00:14:48.34
But they end up with this massive NVA convoy.

257
00:14:48.34 --> 00:14:53.50
And when I say massive, I mean massive, it takes hours to get by and there's people and

258
00:14:53.50 --> 00:14:57.86
there's trucks and there's bulldozers and there's tanks.

259
00:14:57.86 --> 00:14:59.34
Yeah.

260
00:14:59.34 --> 00:15:00.70
And again, I got to point this out.

261
00:15:00.70 --> 00:15:05.62
So we're probably talking, you know, a thousand enemy soldiers at least that are patrolling

262
00:15:05.62 --> 00:15:07.94
by you for now for three hours.

263
00:15:07.94 --> 00:15:09.06
They're walking by you.

264
00:15:09.06 --> 00:15:12.86
And meanwhile, you got a team of six guys, eight guys, something like that.

265
00:15:12.86 --> 00:15:14.10
I think we knew it was seven or eight.

266
00:15:14.10 --> 00:15:19.90
I forget, but yeah, and their, and their marntonness and pat was familiar with all the

267
00:15:19.90 --> 00:15:21.46
Russian tanks.

268
00:15:21.46 --> 00:15:25.98
So he knew what the Russian tanks were and he had it all the intel together.

269
00:15:25.98 --> 00:15:29.82
And just one of those, another night in Saga, another night in Saga.

270
00:15:29.82 --> 00:15:35.98
So they're sitting there waiting and they, eventually, they go by and, and eventually,

271
00:15:35.98 --> 00:15:40.34
now, one of the, one of the indaged soldiers that was working alongside Watkins, one

272
00:15:40.34 --> 00:15:44.06
of members of the team was named Ron, R-O-N-G.

273
00:15:44.06 --> 00:15:48.14
And he comes up after this convoy goes by, he comes up and this is what happens.

274
00:15:48.14 --> 00:15:50.14
I'm going to the book here.

275
00:15:50.14 --> 00:15:53.54
Ron said he'd been watching the road traffic just like Watkins.

276
00:15:53.54 --> 00:15:58.06
And it had been taken, taken, had been taken as taken with it as he was.

277
00:15:58.06 --> 00:16:01.66
I mean, he was like lost and like, oh my god, they can't believe this is all stuff.

278
00:16:01.66 --> 00:16:05.78
While he was staring at all the vehicles passing by, a hand had reached out and given

279
00:16:05.78 --> 00:16:07.34
his arm a shake.

280
00:16:07.34 --> 00:16:13.18
A montnyard soldier, one of those, the NVA, had pressed into unwilling service, said,

281
00:16:13.18 --> 00:16:14.82
it's your time for guard duty.

282
00:16:14.82 --> 00:16:20.74
Is that close to the enemy or what?

283
00:16:20.74 --> 00:16:22.62
That's nuts.

284
00:16:22.62 --> 00:16:23.94
Oh yeah.

285
00:16:23.94 --> 00:16:25.90
Completely nuts.

286
00:16:25.90 --> 00:16:31.62
The montnyards, which you guys called yards, the nungs, the south Vietnamese, even

287
00:16:31.62 --> 00:16:35.62
sometimes former NVA soldiers.

288
00:16:35.62 --> 00:16:36.62
What was it like?

289
00:16:36.62 --> 00:16:37.82
Who did you mainly work with?

290
00:16:37.82 --> 00:16:41.86
What were the differences between the different groups, their different ethnic personalities?

291
00:16:41.86 --> 00:16:44.58
And I know we didn't talk about a lot of the last time you talked about in the book, but

292
00:16:44.58 --> 00:16:47.54
those different ethnicities didn't always get along.

293
00:16:47.54 --> 00:16:48.54
Oh no.

294
00:16:48.54 --> 00:16:50.54
Especially when it came to playing poker apparently.

295
00:16:50.54 --> 00:16:55.02
Oh yeah, that's the first few days at Fubai.

296
00:16:55.02 --> 00:16:56.02
They had a poker game.

297
00:16:56.02 --> 00:16:57.74
They went to Rai.

298
00:16:57.74 --> 00:16:59.62
And the Cambodian lost.

299
00:16:59.62 --> 00:17:03.78
He goes to his room, gets a fry grenade, comes back and dumps it on the montnyards.

300
00:17:03.78 --> 00:17:06.74
So we had an instant fire flight in the compound.

301
00:17:06.74 --> 00:17:10.26
And you know, you always going through the training, you'd turn about the different groups.

302
00:17:10.26 --> 00:17:16.02
Well, that case we had the Cambodians, montnyards, nungs, and my team was south Vietnamese.

303
00:17:16.02 --> 00:17:22.74
Which included at least four guys that came south in 54 when there was 18-month

304
00:17:22.74 --> 00:17:25.66
truce where anybody at the North could go south.

305
00:17:25.66 --> 00:17:30.06
And thousands did, the Navy had a special operation where he had ships going up to the

306
00:17:30.06 --> 00:17:33.22
Nui and shipping thousands of people south.

307
00:17:33.22 --> 00:17:34.58
Nobody went north.

308
00:17:34.58 --> 00:17:37.14
Nobody wanted to be up with the Commies.

309
00:17:37.14 --> 00:17:39.14
But we had four of them on my team.

310
00:17:39.14 --> 00:17:41.58
They were just outstanding groups.

311
00:17:41.58 --> 00:17:44.58
And so that was Fubai.

312
00:17:44.58 --> 00:17:49.18
And his team was the brew, which was the lowest of the montnyards, truce.

313
00:17:49.18 --> 00:17:50.18
Cute.

314
00:17:50.18 --> 00:17:52.74
They couldn't throw a hand grenade where the shit.

315
00:17:52.74 --> 00:17:53.74
But fearless.

316
00:17:53.74 --> 00:17:56.02
And they hated the North Vietnamese.

317
00:17:56.02 --> 00:17:57.02
That's one of the key points.

318
00:17:57.02 --> 00:18:02.10
And you talk about it in the book is how much, what the North Vietnamese had done to the

319
00:18:02.10 --> 00:18:09.18
montnyards and how much they fiercely hated them and how fiercely loyal they were to you

320
00:18:09.18 --> 00:18:10.18
guys.

321
00:18:10.18 --> 00:18:11.18
Oh yeah.

322
00:18:11.18 --> 00:18:12.42
Amazing truce.

323
00:18:12.42 --> 00:18:15.10
And they would just fight to the end.

324
00:18:15.10 --> 00:18:21.62
And there's more than one guy who like one zero who had a, we call them effectively,

325
00:18:21.62 --> 00:18:23.10
our little people.

326
00:18:23.10 --> 00:18:25.62
The little people said, I'll take a bullet for you.

327
00:18:25.62 --> 00:18:27.74
That's how dedicated they were.

328
00:18:27.74 --> 00:18:29.18
And they proved that over and over again.

329
00:18:29.18 --> 00:18:30.54
Over and over again.

330
00:18:30.54 --> 00:18:35.70
Now, some teams had troubles, but we never had it like a my team or with the, the Frenchman,

331
00:18:35.70 --> 00:18:41.10
most majority of teams, the little people took care of vetting their own.

332
00:18:41.10 --> 00:18:46.54
So like when Idaho was wiped out, sal and hept went out and recruited and there were young

333
00:18:46.54 --> 00:18:49.46
kids, 15 years old, we brought on the team.

334
00:18:49.46 --> 00:18:51.90
But they vetted him and we never worried about him.

335
00:18:51.90 --> 00:18:56.34
So we didn't have to worry about the friendly fire or what they call today with the blue fire.

336
00:18:56.34 --> 00:19:02.38
Yeah, they call it, they call it friendly fire.

337
00:19:02.38 --> 00:19:03.38
Yeah, this is cool.

338
00:19:03.38 --> 00:19:05.46
They have another, they have another word for it too.

339
00:19:05.46 --> 00:19:06.86
I think what it is.

340
00:19:06.86 --> 00:19:08.82
Because friendly fire is like a mistake, right?

341
00:19:08.82 --> 00:19:13.62
What we're talking about is when you know, you're on, yeah, one of your Taliban forces or

342
00:19:13.62 --> 00:19:18.22
one of your local forces is actually a Taliban person in terms of yours.

343
00:19:18.22 --> 00:19:21.74
But actually a, a, a, a moddy militia guy in terms on you.

344
00:19:21.74 --> 00:19:24.10
So those things, those things are scary.

345
00:19:24.10 --> 00:19:27.42
Very, because he build up trust and all the sudden the guy turns on you.

346
00:19:27.42 --> 00:19:32.86
Yeah, because early on, somewhere eight camps had trouble with that with their, the

347
00:19:32.86 --> 00:19:39.06
mountaineers that turned, who had been more loyal to the communist for some reason.

348
00:19:39.06 --> 00:19:43.54
But then there's other had issues because they, they like special forces, but they were

349
00:19:43.54 --> 00:19:46.18
pissed off working with the South Vietnamese.

350
00:19:46.18 --> 00:19:47.98
And they, they were just, they don't kill.

351
00:19:47.98 --> 00:19:52.58
They would have to kill South Vietnamese or allies or the communist up north.

352
00:19:52.58 --> 00:19:56.26
And sometimes you had like guys don't, don't kill our allies.

353
00:19:56.26 --> 00:19:57.46
Not today, please.

354
00:19:57.46 --> 00:19:59.50
But I never had that.

355
00:19:59.50 --> 00:20:00.86
My team was all South Vietnamese.

356
00:20:00.86 --> 00:20:02.98
Oh, man.

357
00:20:02.98 --> 00:20:10.14
So one of the, one of the other crazy parts of this book that you open with or you start

358
00:20:10.14 --> 00:20:18.94
one of the early chapters is this, this attack on F O B 4, which was just sound completely,

359
00:20:18.94 --> 00:20:20.22
completely horrible.

360
00:20:20.22 --> 00:20:25.06
And here, here's a quote from the book, the entire compound, this is after this attack

361
00:20:25.06 --> 00:20:26.06
happens.

362
00:20:26.06 --> 00:20:31.22
The entire compound was now a swirling battleground with dozens of small, but ready, deadly

363
00:20:31.22 --> 00:20:33.58
dire, fire flights in progress.

364
00:20:33.58 --> 00:20:37.78
It was difficult to tell the scantily clad Americans and indigenous personnel from the

365
00:20:37.78 --> 00:20:38.78
enemy.

366
00:20:38.78 --> 00:20:43.86
And there was no command coordination, just a lot of individuals struggling against uncertain

367
00:20:43.86 --> 00:20:45.30
overwhelming odds.

368
00:20:45.30 --> 00:20:48.06
The air was filled with enough chaos to overload the census.

369
00:20:48.06 --> 00:20:53.74
Screams, shouts, bullets, dust, smoke, the smell of cordi burning wood, rubber and fuel

370
00:20:53.74 --> 00:20:58.58
and lastly, the smell of seared flesh.

371
00:20:58.58 --> 00:21:05.94
And this, this attack resulted in 17 special forces soldiers were killed.

372
00:21:05.94 --> 00:21:10.70
And I don't know the number of indigenous forces that were killed, but this sounded like

373
00:21:10.70 --> 00:21:16.54
just a complete, I mean, it was obviously a big win for the enemy.

374
00:21:16.54 --> 00:21:18.66
And what was your perspective on all that?

375
00:21:18.66 --> 00:21:20.02
Where were you when that happened?

376
00:21:20.02 --> 00:21:28.34
I was safely in Scotland, F O B 1, because F O B 4 had opened at the end of 67.

377
00:21:28.34 --> 00:21:33.18
And if I had the base of a mountain, and there's a whole lot of political reasons why

378
00:21:33.18 --> 00:21:34.58
they're at the base of a mountain.

379
00:21:34.58 --> 00:21:36.46
But anyways, they were there.

380
00:21:36.46 --> 00:21:43.02
They had a test attack by the VIA Kong, a great amount of Christmas time of 67.

381
00:21:43.02 --> 00:21:49.54
And on August 23rd, after the dust settled, the men who were there like Pat Walkens estimated

382
00:21:49.54 --> 00:21:53.30
that that attack in December was a test to see what.

383
00:21:53.30 --> 00:21:56.42
Could they had minimal defense to stop minimal wire?

384
00:21:56.42 --> 00:22:01.22
The internal security force was riddled with VIA Kong.

385
00:22:01.22 --> 00:22:06.58
And they planned to attack for over a year, the Sapper attack with the NVA Sappers, as well

386
00:22:06.58 --> 00:22:11.78
as VIA Kong, Holly Train Sappers, and the conventional troops that went in just

387
00:22:11.78 --> 00:22:17.98
putting a loincloth and a car in a weapon or a satchel charge and hand grenades.

388
00:22:17.98 --> 00:22:22.34
And so I was at Fou by the hit after midnight.

389
00:22:22.34 --> 00:22:26.14
There's always discussed about what time they hit.

390
00:22:26.14 --> 00:22:31.18
And since then, we've had a military intelligence officer who came back and one of the

391
00:22:31.18 --> 00:22:34.62
people that we said was 17, it's actually 16.

392
00:22:34.62 --> 00:22:39.58
But still, the highest number of green berets killed in one battle in our special forces

393
00:22:39.58 --> 00:22:41.14
history.

394
00:22:41.14 --> 00:22:46.06
And fortunately, we had a recon team up on the hill on Marl-Mountain at night that took

395
00:22:46.06 --> 00:22:49.46
out the mortars.

396
00:22:49.46 --> 00:22:52.18
Because the enemy were just dropping the mortars off the mountain until they camp on top

397
00:22:52.18 --> 00:22:53.18
everything else.

398
00:22:53.18 --> 00:22:55.46
Because they don't care about friendly fire.

399
00:22:55.46 --> 00:22:57.26
Speaking to friendly fire, the enemy doesn't care.

400
00:22:57.26 --> 00:22:58.26
No.

401
00:22:58.26 --> 00:23:01.78
They're dropping mortars on their own people as long as they're killing some of their

402
00:23:01.78 --> 00:23:02.78
enemy as well.

403
00:23:02.78 --> 00:23:09.06
And some of them had their bandanas and said, we came here to die and they did.

404
00:23:09.06 --> 00:23:10.06
What did that?

405
00:23:10.06 --> 00:23:16.78
What were the repercussions that went through your community after that happened?

406
00:23:16.78 --> 00:23:24.58
Everybody, you know, it's one thing to talk about being hit by an enemy force at night.

407
00:23:24.58 --> 00:23:25.90
They fight when they want to fight.

408
00:23:25.90 --> 00:23:27.42
That's a classic example of them doing it.

409
00:23:27.42 --> 00:23:29.42
They planned it for over a year.

410
00:23:29.42 --> 00:23:33.54
They even came in and took over the Indigenous Messe Hall for a final briefing in the

411
00:23:33.54 --> 00:23:38.22
base that night before they launched the attack.

412
00:23:38.22 --> 00:23:40.50
And so that's how well planned it was.

413
00:23:40.50 --> 00:23:47.06
So they went in to the Indigenous camp, the friendly camp, and gave their final briefing

414
00:23:47.06 --> 00:23:49.98
for the attack inside of the friendly camp.

415
00:23:49.98 --> 00:23:50.98
Yep.

416
00:23:50.98 --> 00:23:55.78
And they had two of our loyal Indigenous troops that saw something suspicious when they

417
00:23:55.78 --> 00:24:01.02
went up the NBA killed them right away and left their bodies liner.

418
00:24:01.02 --> 00:24:02.54
And so it was really well planned.

419
00:24:02.54 --> 00:24:04.50
They knew the camp.

420
00:24:04.50 --> 00:24:06.18
We had a promotion board.

421
00:24:06.18 --> 00:24:12.34
So all of the, at that time there was six FOBs, one through six.

422
00:24:12.34 --> 00:24:14.86
This was FOB 4 in Denang.

423
00:24:14.86 --> 00:24:19.14
And so all of the people up for promotions came in that day.

424
00:24:19.14 --> 00:24:20.78
Most of them stayed at night.

425
00:24:20.78 --> 00:24:25.18
On top of that, we had, they had monthly command and control briefing.

426
00:24:25.18 --> 00:24:33.34
So every CO, as well as the ZS3 or the EXO from each of the FOBs was all that FOB4.

427
00:24:33.34 --> 00:24:39.26
And then we had a command and control element that was based at the Denang Air Base.

428
00:24:39.26 --> 00:24:41.34
And they had just moved on to base.

429
00:24:41.34 --> 00:24:44.78
So had increased population and they knew it.

430
00:24:44.78 --> 00:24:46.06
And that's the way they planned it.

431
00:24:46.06 --> 00:24:51.70
And they planned it on a night when there's no moon.

432
00:24:51.70 --> 00:24:56.14
But to always respect your enemy.

433
00:24:56.14 --> 00:24:57.14
Always.

434
00:24:57.14 --> 00:24:59.34
And then we always carried a weapon, no matter where we went.

435
00:24:59.34 --> 00:25:01.10
There's one thing to be like F would be one.

436
00:25:01.10 --> 00:25:02.90
We had a good security there.

437
00:25:02.90 --> 00:25:08.94
But even then, you don't know because they, via combat, come and we found mortar markers

438
00:25:08.94 --> 00:25:10.82
on the roof of the clubhouse.

439
00:25:10.82 --> 00:25:12.70
And they had come in and walked it out.

440
00:25:12.70 --> 00:25:17.02
And there's part of their, via combat, come in and help do whatever it was in base.

441
00:25:17.02 --> 00:25:22.62
But they were also there marking targets for future mortar attacks on our, on our compound.

442
00:25:22.62 --> 00:25:23.62
Yeah.

443
00:25:23.62 --> 00:25:26.42
That would happen that my first deployment to Iraq, I was in Baghdad.

444
00:25:26.42 --> 00:25:31.90
And we would, they would occasionally roll up guys that had their GPS's, you know, the

445
00:25:31.90 --> 00:25:36.30
little contractors, guys that did everything from empty out the port of Potties.

446
00:25:36.30 --> 00:25:37.54
There was guys that cut hair.

447
00:25:37.54 --> 00:25:39.82
These were just, you know, there was civilians.

448
00:25:39.82 --> 00:25:42.22
Iraqi civilians that worked on the base.

449
00:25:42.22 --> 00:25:43.46
And occasionally they'd get rolled up.

450
00:25:43.46 --> 00:25:45.34
They'd look at their phone or look at their white.

451
00:25:45.34 --> 00:25:47.94
What are they carrying that have a GPS with them and sure enough they're out there trying

452
00:25:47.94 --> 00:25:51.18
to figure out where, where's a good place to drop a mortar.

453
00:25:51.18 --> 00:25:57.86
I actually, like, kicked all the contractors out of our compound completely.

454
00:25:57.86 --> 00:26:02.38
And that's something that I had heard from the Vietnam vets was like, nope, you don't,

455
00:26:02.38 --> 00:26:04.58
you don't know who's who, you just don't let them in.

456
00:26:04.58 --> 00:26:05.58
Yeah.

457
00:26:05.58 --> 00:26:08.86
So when I showed up, we actually moved the port of Potties outside of our compound.

458
00:26:08.86 --> 00:26:14.06
We had to go outside if we wanted to, they were still in American area.

459
00:26:14.06 --> 00:26:17.10
But they were not inside of our compound.

460
00:26:17.10 --> 00:26:21.30
So they, so there was no locals inside our compound at all, zero.

461
00:26:21.30 --> 00:26:22.78
That's what we did when I showed up.

462
00:26:22.78 --> 00:26:26.82
And that's why I did it because I was, I heard, hey, look, there's going to be people

463
00:26:26.82 --> 00:26:28.66
that will be gathering intelligence on you.

464
00:26:28.66 --> 00:26:31.66
And if they're in the compound, you can't, you can't vet every single civilian that's

465
00:26:31.66 --> 00:26:32.70
going to come out there.

466
00:26:32.70 --> 00:26:34.58
The contractors, scary.

467
00:26:34.58 --> 00:26:35.58
It is.

468
00:26:35.58 --> 00:26:41.42
Yeah, I was, that's, that is the chapter that you, you actually covered in two chapters

469
00:26:41.42 --> 00:26:47.10
because it's such a horrible incident, but that's incredible read to see what those guys

470
00:26:47.10 --> 00:26:48.10
went through.

471
00:26:48.10 --> 00:26:49.10
Oh, yeah.

472
00:26:49.10 --> 00:26:50.46
How many did you just go interview people?

473
00:26:50.46 --> 00:26:52.46
How did you get all that information?

474
00:26:52.46 --> 00:26:57.50
Well, um, several of our guys, Melville, be one with there at night.

475
00:26:57.50 --> 00:27:02.90
So on the 24th, after, by noon time, everything is settled down.

476
00:27:02.90 --> 00:27:05.98
They, you know, they failed in their attack.

477
00:27:05.98 --> 00:27:06.98
We had control to camp.

478
00:27:06.98 --> 00:27:10.98
A relief forest from F will be one went down, led by Colonel Barr, Lieutenant Colonel

479
00:27:10.98 --> 00:27:18.10
Barr, and they went through and cleaned up any of the left, last pockets of enemy soldiers.

480
00:27:18.10 --> 00:27:21.06
And there was a, a POW camp right next to us.

481
00:27:21.06 --> 00:27:26.90
And, initially, there was an effort to free the 500, so POWs that were going to break

482
00:27:26.90 --> 00:27:30.18
loose to come in to further help overrun our base.

483
00:27:30.18 --> 00:27:38.14
But a couple of, uh, people made a key effort, uh, on that line to the north to stop the, uh,

484
00:27:38.14 --> 00:27:41.62
pending escape of the NVA there.

485
00:27:41.62 --> 00:27:45.26
She's the ultimate tipping point in the direction.

486
00:27:45.26 --> 00:27:48.46
There's a good, there's a good, there's a good one to miss.

487
00:27:48.46 --> 00:27:50.94
So anyway, I, and answer your question.

488
00:27:50.94 --> 00:27:53.14
We have a lot of things in my mind.

489
00:27:53.14 --> 00:27:56.98
And then we closed that for B1 in January and went south.

490
00:27:56.98 --> 00:28:00.98
And so shoveled a guy's that had performed that night or survived it were all there.

491
00:28:00.98 --> 00:28:04.02
I talked to him, said mental notes.

492
00:28:04.02 --> 00:28:06.50
And then, uh, when I worked on the book, we came back.

493
00:28:06.50 --> 00:28:08.14
And I did a piece for soldier of fortune.

494
00:28:08.14 --> 00:28:11.14
I used to wrote under a nomadate plume.

495
00:28:11.14 --> 00:28:15.38
And we did a first story written about that back in the day.

496
00:28:15.38 --> 00:28:20.66
And the soldier of fortune printed back in the 80s sometime or early 90s.

497
00:28:20.66 --> 00:28:22.78
So I used that and then build on it.

498
00:28:22.78 --> 00:28:26.70
And then John Peters, the co-author on that book, uh, on the ground.

499
00:28:26.70 --> 00:28:27.86
He was there at night.

500
00:28:27.86 --> 00:28:29.42
And he was in the hooch.

501
00:28:29.42 --> 00:28:34.82
He and the, the god shawl sf, the two drunk from that night.

502
00:28:34.82 --> 00:28:37.26
Like many of the people that were there.

503
00:28:37.26 --> 00:28:41.86
And, uh, but the young, uh, Bill Brick charged out a hooch.

504
00:28:41.86 --> 00:28:45.82
And it was gunned down immediately because they had machine gun, uh, positions set up.

505
00:28:45.82 --> 00:28:49.06
So anybody came out, they would gun them down.

506
00:28:49.06 --> 00:28:52.06
And that one element that was up on top of the mountain there.

507
00:28:52.06 --> 00:28:53.06
Yeah.

508
00:28:53.06 --> 00:28:56.46
And there was, there was one American with multiple, uh, is that right?

509
00:28:56.46 --> 00:28:57.46
There was one American.

510
00:28:57.46 --> 00:28:59.26
There was two, uh, Ed Aims was up there.

511
00:28:59.26 --> 00:29:00.62
He was the one zero.

512
00:29:00.62 --> 00:29:03.94
And the Larry Trimble was actually one doing a lot of the operational stuff.

513
00:29:03.94 --> 00:29:07.42
Because, uh, Aims was monitoring the radio.

514
00:29:07.42 --> 00:29:12.56
And it was he Larry and his people to took out the mortars that night, or the, the

515
00:29:12.56 --> 00:29:14.06
Cassi rate would have been much higher.

516
00:29:14.06 --> 00:29:18.18
And then their indigest said, hey, we're going back down the next day.

517
00:29:18.18 --> 00:29:19.18
The next day.

518
00:29:19.18 --> 00:29:20.18
Cause Ed Aims went out.

519
00:29:20.18 --> 00:29:22.06
The, the king became in, lifted him out.

520
00:29:22.06 --> 00:29:23.78
They put it in replacement.

521
00:29:23.78 --> 00:29:26.10
Who sprayed his ankle or something, getting off the helicopter.

522
00:29:26.10 --> 00:29:28.02
So he could not move.

523
00:29:28.02 --> 00:29:29.30
But he, so he worked the radio.

524
00:29:29.30 --> 00:29:33.18
But Larry was the guy taking care of everything on top.

525
00:29:33.18 --> 00:29:36.70
And, uh, yeah, so the indigest said they wanted to go down the day and Larry said, well,

526
00:29:36.70 --> 00:29:40.90
you might run into ambushes going down marble mountain.

527
00:29:40.90 --> 00:29:43.30
Because what we didn't know was underneath marble mountain.

528
00:29:43.30 --> 00:29:47.50
There was layers of, of, uh, stories.

529
00:29:47.50 --> 00:29:51.82
They had hospitals down there via con training grounds, everything else, which we learned

530
00:29:51.82 --> 00:29:53.42
about years later.

531
00:29:53.42 --> 00:29:55.50
Right along with the Buddhist monks that were all down there.

532
00:29:55.50 --> 00:29:58.10
They, they co-asict the peacefully.

533
00:29:58.10 --> 00:30:02.30
And so, uh, yeah, they went down and Larry's for a while was by himself up there.

534
00:30:02.30 --> 00:30:03.30
Yeah, they got to.

535
00:30:03.30 --> 00:30:04.30
That's our great.

536
00:30:04.30 --> 00:30:05.54
Yeah, those guys get a firefight.

537
00:30:05.54 --> 00:30:06.54
They come back.

538
00:30:06.54 --> 00:30:07.54
Yeah.

539
00:30:07.54 --> 00:30:09.50
But when they left, he's up there by himself.

540
00:30:09.50 --> 00:30:12.26
He's just, uh, hey, I got this, he's the loon Ranger.

541
00:30:12.26 --> 00:30:13.26
He's the loon Ranger.

542
00:30:13.26 --> 00:30:14.66
Your own Ranger going to defend this thing until he's dead.

543
00:30:14.66 --> 00:30:15.66
That was his attitude.

544
00:30:15.66 --> 00:30:16.66
That was, that's Larry.

545
00:30:16.66 --> 00:30:17.66
Reak an unbelievable.

546
00:30:17.66 --> 00:30:18.66
Oh, yeah.

547
00:30:18.66 --> 00:30:19.66
Absolutely.

548
00:30:19.66 --> 00:30:21.66
You got to get this book and read these, these parts.

549
00:30:21.66 --> 00:30:26.62
They're, uh, they're epic.

550
00:30:26.62 --> 00:30:27.62
Epic heroism.

551
00:30:27.62 --> 00:30:31.26
I mean, and, and crazy, and incredible lessons learned as well.

552
00:30:31.26 --> 00:30:35.58
And I know you're not, we're just talking about lessons learned at how easily lessons

553
00:30:35.58 --> 00:30:37.30
get forgotten in the military.

554
00:30:37.30 --> 00:30:40.38
And it happens in any organization, but in the military for sure, you know, because guys

555
00:30:40.38 --> 00:30:43.22
are going there in a command for two or three years or maybe four years.

556
00:30:43.22 --> 00:30:44.22
And then there are somewhere else.

557
00:30:44.22 --> 00:30:47.58
And then someone else comes in and different experiences and no one agrees on what's

558
00:30:47.58 --> 00:30:48.58
right and what's wrong.

559
00:30:48.58 --> 00:30:50.98
And the next thing, you know, you, the lessons are gone.

560
00:30:50.98 --> 00:30:51.98
You forget them.

561
00:30:51.98 --> 00:30:59.02
So these books right here capture some incredibly important lessons for anyone on the battlefield,

562
00:30:59.02 --> 00:31:01.06
or even close to it.

563
00:31:01.06 --> 00:31:07.54
Um, I want to get down to kind of the end of your first tour here.

564
00:31:07.54 --> 00:31:15.78
And I'm going to the book when I, when one April, 1969 arrived, I was a conflicted man.

565
00:31:15.78 --> 00:31:18.54
The end of my tour was slated for 27 April.

566
00:31:18.54 --> 00:31:23.54
So far, I had avoided the short timers attitude because, after all, it was Vietnam and

567
00:31:23.54 --> 00:31:27.26
we were engaged in guerrilla warfare across the fence.

568
00:31:27.26 --> 00:31:31.86
Nonetheless, I couldn't believe I was still alive.

569
00:31:31.86 --> 00:31:34.74
I looked forward to going back to the world.

570
00:31:34.74 --> 00:31:40.18
And yet I felt incredibly guilty about leaving Sau, hepp, and fuck.

571
00:31:40.18 --> 00:31:47.62
And the other men at CCN behind, which is CCN is what they renamed FF4.

572
00:31:47.62 --> 00:31:55.34
I believed in the SF mission, but how long could RT Idaho go on without a casualty?

573
00:31:55.34 --> 00:32:01.66
We hadn't lost a man to hostile fire since May, 1968 when the previous incarnation lost

574
00:32:01.66 --> 00:32:04.58
six men in Louss.

575
00:32:04.58 --> 00:32:08.46
RT Idaho had run a lot of missions, been in a lot of firefights.

576
00:32:08.46 --> 00:32:13.58
It wasn't a stay behind team that's schemes to remain in camp.

577
00:32:13.58 --> 00:32:19.50
I was alive, thanks, in large part, to the skills and courage of Sau, hip, torn, and the

578
00:32:19.50 --> 00:32:25.22
other Vietnamese team members, as well as to the courage and flying skills of the Vietnamese

579
00:32:25.22 --> 00:32:28.18
King B pilots and the American pilots.

580
00:32:28.18 --> 00:32:33.42
The Marines in Scarface, the judge and the executioner, as well as attack air pilots who

581
00:32:33.42 --> 00:32:36.42
always responded to our calls for help.

582
00:32:36.42 --> 00:32:42.10
We were alive because the recon gods had smiled on the reassembled RT Idaho.

583
00:32:42.10 --> 00:32:48.70
Somehow the magical elixir of trust, training, instinct, guts, timing, and gods' good

584
00:32:48.70 --> 00:32:52.14
grace had fallen into place.

585
00:32:52.14 --> 00:32:56.02
There were other things that were collectively wearing on me toward the end of my first

586
00:32:56.02 --> 00:32:57.18
tour duty.

587
00:32:57.18 --> 00:33:02.66
By April 1969, both Lynn Black and I were frustrated with having enemy soldiers shooting

588
00:33:02.66 --> 00:33:07.90
us out of so many targets as the helicopters approached LZs for landing.

589
00:33:07.90 --> 00:33:13.26
And when we weren't in the field, we found RT Idaho getting frequently assigned to guard

590
00:33:13.26 --> 00:33:19.82
duty atop marble mountain because Black and I had continually butted heads with the ramps.

591
00:33:19.82 --> 00:33:24.98
To add insult to injury, there conveniently were never any choppers available to airlift

592
00:33:24.98 --> 00:33:26.10
us to the top.

593
00:33:26.10 --> 00:33:30.34
We had to hump all our supplies ourselves, which was still a dicey business in the

594
00:33:30.34 --> 00:33:35.66
light of all the VC activity in the village to the south of the mountain and that in

595
00:33:35.66 --> 00:33:37.22
the cave deep inside it.

596
00:33:37.22 --> 00:33:40.50
We always moved up marble mountain on full alert.

597
00:33:40.50 --> 00:33:44.86
On one such trip, Sau was training hung to run point.

598
00:33:44.86 --> 00:33:50.74
Long earned his pay that day as he found and deactivated more than a dozen booby traps, including

599
00:33:50.74 --> 00:33:56.26
a claymore mine that had a pressure released firing device on it.

600
00:33:56.26 --> 00:34:02.38
So you're sort of down time, like hey we're back in camp, we're just going to pull a

601
00:34:02.38 --> 00:34:04.62
little easy duty here, just stand some guard duty.

602
00:34:04.62 --> 00:34:06.50
Oh, we got to go up to marble mountain.

603
00:34:06.50 --> 00:34:08.10
Oh, there's no one to take us up there.

604
00:34:08.10 --> 00:34:11.38
So we're going to have to patrol up there and you're going up there and you find on your

605
00:34:11.38 --> 00:34:13.74
way up there more than a dozen booby traps.

606
00:34:13.74 --> 00:34:17.10
Oh yeah, that's trying to get to your guard duty.

607
00:34:17.10 --> 00:34:20.82
Yeah, I guess that could wear on you a little bit.

608
00:34:20.82 --> 00:34:23.26
That was significant day.

609
00:34:23.26 --> 00:34:24.78
We didn't sleep well that night.

610
00:34:24.78 --> 00:34:25.78
Oh, right.

611
00:34:25.78 --> 00:34:28.58
So this marble mountain, how long was the patrol to get there from base?

612
00:34:28.58 --> 00:34:35.34
Well, it was close by and we would use you walk around to the south side of the mountain

613
00:34:35.34 --> 00:34:41.30
and there were stairs that you'd go up before you get to the trails because it was so steep

614
00:34:41.30 --> 00:34:46.46
to get to the top that there's only a certain number of ways you could walk up.

615
00:34:46.46 --> 00:34:52.98
And you always try to alter how you go, but there's only so many times you can alter it.

616
00:34:52.98 --> 00:34:57.34
And so that day the way we went, so a sal on home really earned their pay.

617
00:34:57.34 --> 00:34:59.94
I mean, they they fell out of these damn things.

618
00:34:59.94 --> 00:35:01.34
But that had been me.

619
00:35:01.34 --> 00:35:05.46
Now Lynn's Lynn was a little bit more sharp and keen on me, but that had been me.

620
00:35:05.46 --> 00:35:11.26
I would have been a hamburger meal on that first claim more.

621
00:35:11.26 --> 00:35:13.66
And so that stuff, like I said, it's wearing on you.

622
00:35:13.66 --> 00:35:15.50
Obviously, it would wear on anyone.

623
00:35:15.50 --> 00:35:16.74
But that's the end of your tour.

624
00:35:16.74 --> 00:35:22.18
You get done with that tour and we touched on this a little bit on the last time.

625
00:35:22.18 --> 00:35:24.82
But I wanted to go a little bit deeper on it.

626
00:35:24.82 --> 00:35:29.14
You're coming back to America after your first to want to Vietnam.

627
00:35:29.14 --> 00:35:30.46
How old are you?

628
00:35:30.46 --> 00:35:32.66
It's a 69 23.

629
00:35:32.66 --> 00:35:34.70
23 years old.

630
00:35:34.70 --> 00:35:40.22
And when you get back again, you touched on this a little bit, but they assigned you to

631
00:35:40.22 --> 00:35:47.66
a signal company, meaning you're not an operational guy.

632
00:35:47.66 --> 00:35:51.50
And you're in with some, and you're just coming out of Vietnam.

633
00:35:51.50 --> 00:35:57.74
You're hearing people are saying, like, hey, what do you, you know, wasn't even, wasn't even,

634
00:35:57.74 --> 00:36:00.74
there's guys that are actively avoiding going to Vietnam.

635
00:36:00.74 --> 00:36:03.90
Oh, yeah, this is the 10 special forces group.

636
00:36:03.90 --> 00:36:07.42
And they had been in Germany since 52.

637
00:36:07.42 --> 00:36:10.18
And they had, they were actively involved in a cold war.

638
00:36:10.18 --> 00:36:12.26
And those guys earned their pay there.

639
00:36:12.26 --> 00:36:19.30
In fact, one of the first books just came out on Dead A, which was there in the cold war.

640
00:36:19.30 --> 00:36:22.10
But this is a special forces unit.

641
00:36:22.10 --> 00:36:26.42
So companies A through D were active.

642
00:36:26.42 --> 00:36:29.18
E because of my MLS, Kamal.

643
00:36:29.18 --> 00:36:30.54
Oh, because you were a radio man.

644
00:36:30.54 --> 00:36:31.54
I threw a radio man.

645
00:36:31.54 --> 00:36:33.54
They stuck me there.

646
00:36:33.54 --> 00:36:38.30
And we had four or five Patoons and they're new officers.

647
00:36:38.30 --> 00:36:41.38
They're butter bars, like right out of OCS.

648
00:36:41.38 --> 00:36:42.18
They're young.

649
00:36:42.18 --> 00:36:46.46
And they treated everybody like was basic training.

650
00:36:46.46 --> 00:36:50.98
And my first thing was, excuse me, this is an SF unit, even though it's signal.

651
00:36:50.98 --> 00:36:57.66
So the signal, the officers inside that Patoon, they're not, they're not SF guys.

652
00:36:57.66 --> 00:36:59.78
They're like communications officers.

653
00:36:59.78 --> 00:37:00.78
You know what?

654
00:37:00.78 --> 00:37:03.30
I'm not even sure I just knew they were young and dumb.

655
00:37:03.30 --> 00:37:04.30
And not respected.

656
00:37:04.30 --> 00:37:06.74
And then we had the Patoon, other Patoon swords.

657
00:37:06.74 --> 00:37:12.06
Each one was fat and out of shape and had avoided going to Vietnam and was proud of it.

658
00:37:12.06 --> 00:37:17.30
And made fun of me and a couple of guys from D company because we weren't smart enough

659
00:37:17.30 --> 00:37:19.62
to figure how to get out of going to Vietnam.

660
00:37:19.62 --> 00:37:22.98
I'm going to like, wait a minute, what do you wear on your head?

661
00:37:22.98 --> 00:37:27.02
And so we had some difficult moments dealing with those guys.

662
00:37:27.02 --> 00:37:32.74
And so we had routine training, a signal company with trucks and all this stuff to go and

663
00:37:32.74 --> 00:37:33.74
do these things.

664
00:37:33.74 --> 00:37:38.02
I said, whenever we do one of these little practice runs for a weekend or a mission,

665
00:37:38.02 --> 00:37:39.18
we will win.

666
00:37:39.18 --> 00:37:41.34
Could we're going to get out of here?

667
00:37:41.34 --> 00:37:43.58
Everybody else do the KP and stuff.

668
00:37:43.58 --> 00:37:45.94
And that just pissed everybody off all the more.

669
00:37:45.94 --> 00:37:48.46
I pushed our young guys and pushed them hard.

670
00:37:48.46 --> 00:37:51.22
And based, we do these training missions.

671
00:37:51.22 --> 00:37:52.46
You're out there three or four days.

672
00:37:52.46 --> 00:37:54.54
It's just com-o.

673
00:37:54.54 --> 00:38:00.22
And the way we did it, I can't even tell you details now because I just hated it.

674
00:38:00.22 --> 00:38:03.10
But we won. We were the first ones back to the base.

675
00:38:03.10 --> 00:38:10.70
We had the most signal contact, all the criterion we met and we beat the fat ramps.

676
00:38:10.70 --> 00:38:16.02
Now, and so you're back, where were you stationed at that point?

677
00:38:16.02 --> 00:38:17.50
Four devs, Massachusetts.

678
00:38:17.50 --> 00:38:21.14
So then you've got to, I mean, some people that weren't ever in the military don't realize

679
00:38:21.14 --> 00:38:23.86
this, but even when you're in the military, when you're back in America, you go in

680
00:38:23.86 --> 00:38:24.86
Iraq with normal.

681
00:38:24.86 --> 00:38:27.66
So, really, you go to restaurants, you go to bars.

682
00:38:27.66 --> 00:38:30.66
You live a normal life except for your job, you know, whatever the hours you've got to

683
00:38:30.66 --> 00:38:31.66
work your job.

684
00:38:31.66 --> 00:38:34.14
Then you're living-

685
00:38:34.14 --> 00:38:36.30
How was that transition?

686
00:38:36.30 --> 00:38:40.14
Like now you're just going out for a pizza on a Thursday night.

687
00:38:40.14 --> 00:38:43.66
Now you're going out to have some beers on a Friday night or Saturday night.

688
00:38:43.66 --> 00:38:46.58
How was that transition?

689
00:38:46.58 --> 00:38:50.22
It was difficult because actually we didn't transition.

690
00:38:50.22 --> 00:38:54.02
Basically, hang out mostly with the SF guys up there because there's Massachusetts.

691
00:38:54.02 --> 00:39:01.58
I didn't know much about the small towns and I bought a 442W30, had to get a job just

692
00:39:01.58 --> 00:39:04.58
to pump gas on a weekend, just to get actually a cast.

693
00:39:04.58 --> 00:39:06.42
I hope you'd be able to pay for any insurance.

694
00:39:06.42 --> 00:39:07.74
Did you buy a brand new?

695
00:39:07.74 --> 00:39:08.74
No, used.

696
00:39:08.74 --> 00:39:09.74
Even used.

697
00:39:09.74 --> 00:39:10.74
Oh yeah.

698
00:39:10.74 --> 00:39:11.74
I think it was expensive, huh?

699
00:39:11.74 --> 00:39:12.74
Oh, it could go.

700
00:39:12.74 --> 00:39:20.06
I blew it up on the turn plate at 130 miles an hour, but it was a great car in between.

701
00:39:20.06 --> 00:39:21.78
And so I'm working.

702
00:39:21.78 --> 00:39:23.98
And you know what was your, what was your side job?

703
00:39:23.98 --> 00:39:24.98
Oh, pump and gas.

704
00:39:24.98 --> 00:39:30.86
I had a local shelf station at one of the little towns outside of Fort Devons.

705
00:39:30.86 --> 00:39:35.70
And the guy was a, he was a World War II vet and he had put up a sign.

706
00:39:35.70 --> 00:39:37.74
I bought gas and there's a sign to help one.

707
00:39:37.74 --> 00:39:39.54
I said, hey, I need a cast.

708
00:39:39.54 --> 00:39:42.10
Can I work for you on weekends or if I get a day off?

709
00:39:42.10 --> 00:39:43.18
He said, yeah, come on in.

710
00:39:43.18 --> 00:39:44.66
So I was highly trained.

711
00:39:44.66 --> 00:39:45.98
I could do oil changes.

712
00:39:45.98 --> 00:39:48.74
I could grease them up.

713
00:39:48.74 --> 00:39:50.22
And it was fun.

714
00:39:50.22 --> 00:39:55.26
And so here you were Greenbrae special forces, Vietnam.

715
00:39:55.26 --> 00:40:01.54
Just got down with your first tour and your pumping gas on the weekends.

716
00:40:01.54 --> 00:40:06.78
That had to be a little bit of a, of like a tough thing to swallow.

717
00:40:06.78 --> 00:40:08.86
It was, but you know, we swallowed it.

718
00:40:08.86 --> 00:40:09.86
Yeah.

719
00:40:09.86 --> 00:40:11.14
Because this like I got us survive.

720
00:40:11.14 --> 00:40:15.22
And at the time, I was just, I still had a sweet thing down south.

721
00:40:15.22 --> 00:40:16.22
Okay.

722
00:40:16.22 --> 00:40:18.06
And so she was dealing some issues.

723
00:40:18.06 --> 00:40:21.18
I'm up there, this whole thing's fallen apart.

724
00:40:21.18 --> 00:40:24.62
And Boston Boston was so anti military.

725
00:40:24.62 --> 00:40:27.62
I mean, it just piece freaks, galore.

726
00:40:27.62 --> 00:40:28.98
I went to town twice.

727
00:40:28.98 --> 00:40:32.66
And that I never went back because it was they could tell that we were in the military

728
00:40:32.66 --> 00:40:36.42
because our heroes still shorter than the average ship, be in Boston.

729
00:40:36.42 --> 00:40:37.42
Not a good time.

730
00:40:37.42 --> 00:40:41.34
So we just stayed with our guys, der bars.

731
00:40:41.34 --> 00:40:43.50
We had a few engagements in the bars.

732
00:40:43.50 --> 00:40:46.22
But yeah, I was glad to get out of there.

733
00:40:46.22 --> 00:40:48.42
And we ended up getting in trouble for some of those engagements.

734
00:40:48.42 --> 00:40:49.42
Yes, we did.

735
00:40:49.42 --> 00:40:53.26
Told that the MPs came by cleared base the day before they got there.

736
00:40:53.26 --> 00:40:57.82
And I, I can, so I know taking the fifth amendment on that one.

737
00:40:57.82 --> 00:41:02.46
This is the stock operation that will remain secret indeed.

738
00:41:02.46 --> 00:41:03.86
So you were a little bit on the land.

739
00:41:03.86 --> 00:41:04.94
You were a little bit on the run.

740
00:41:04.94 --> 00:41:05.94
Yes.

741
00:41:05.94 --> 00:41:12.90
And so you run to your, to this woman in DC, is that where she was?

742
00:41:12.90 --> 00:41:16.86
Oh yeah, the Pentagon, there was a woman in charge of SF orders for Southeast Asia.

743
00:41:16.86 --> 00:41:18.66
Her name is Billy Alexander.

744
00:41:18.66 --> 00:41:21.18
She's one of our saints, patron saints.

745
00:41:21.18 --> 00:41:26.94
There was, there was a woman that ran the officers that detailed the officers in this

746
00:41:26.94 --> 00:41:28.74
healtimes for a long, long time.

747
00:41:28.74 --> 00:41:30.98
I want to see if she did it for 40 something years.

748
00:41:30.98 --> 00:41:31.98
Really?

749
00:41:31.98 --> 00:41:33.66
And yeah, I mean, it's the exact same thing.

750
00:41:33.66 --> 00:41:37.46
Like if, if you, if you knew her and she was always great to me.

751
00:41:37.46 --> 00:41:40.46
And I mean, she was very nice to me and she took great care of me.

752
00:41:40.46 --> 00:41:44.42
Probably because I was just lucky enough to have some senior people that knew me and

753
00:41:44.42 --> 00:41:47.14
you know, put a good word, but she was always very nice to me.

754
00:41:47.14 --> 00:41:50.98
But I saw what happened to some guys that maybe she didn't like so much.

755
00:41:50.98 --> 00:41:52.42
And it was rough.

756
00:41:52.42 --> 00:41:56.78
So it sounds like you know, you showed up with some flowers or a bottle of wine.

757
00:41:56.78 --> 00:42:00.54
She was like, and you went, this is independent in the puzzle palace, it's a Pentagon.

758
00:42:00.54 --> 00:42:02.54
Yeah, yeah, same thing.

759
00:42:02.54 --> 00:42:03.54
Same thing.

760
00:42:03.54 --> 00:42:08.66
Yeah, this, no, this, well, and like I said, this woman was always super nice, but she,

761
00:42:08.66 --> 00:42:13.42
she wielded a lot of power, you know, inside inside the seal officer community.

762
00:42:13.42 --> 00:42:14.42
Wow.

763
00:42:14.42 --> 00:42:17.18
Because if she didn't like you, well, she was right in your orders.

764
00:42:17.18 --> 00:42:18.18
Oh, yeah.

765
00:42:18.18 --> 00:42:20.62
And if she liked you, then you know, it was like, you know, and if you were neutral, then what,

766
00:42:20.62 --> 00:42:22.38
you know, she, you're going to do what she's going to do.

767
00:42:22.38 --> 00:42:26.94
But yeah, it sounded like Mrs. Billy Alexander was the same type of thing.

768
00:42:26.94 --> 00:42:28.50
Oh, yeah, I drove down all night.

769
00:42:28.50 --> 00:42:30.90
Got there right in the morning, Pentagon opened, walked in.

770
00:42:30.90 --> 00:42:35.70
This is before any metal detectors, walked in, asked the guy where she was went down, gave

771
00:42:35.70 --> 00:42:36.70
it a wine to flowers.

772
00:42:36.70 --> 00:42:40.74
Please give me orders, came back at the end of the day, drove back all night.

773
00:42:40.74 --> 00:42:43.90
How many people were just going all the way to the Pentagon to try and get orders back

774
00:42:43.90 --> 00:42:44.90
to Vietnam?

775
00:42:44.90 --> 00:42:45.90
Not many.

776
00:42:45.90 --> 00:42:48.58
I'm told not many.

777
00:42:48.58 --> 00:42:49.58
But there were some.

778
00:42:49.58 --> 00:42:51.98
There were other SF guys that really felt more comfortable.

779
00:42:51.98 --> 00:42:52.98
And they wanted to be there.

780
00:42:52.98 --> 00:42:56.86
And there's, I wish I could line up the stories, but there's like Billy Wall and others

781
00:42:56.86 --> 00:42:59.14
that have gone to her over the years.

782
00:42:59.14 --> 00:43:01.14
And gotten her assignments, they wanted.

783
00:43:01.14 --> 00:43:02.54
She, care of SF.

784
00:43:02.54 --> 00:43:04.74
Yeah, that's, I, I told the story of the day.

785
00:43:04.74 --> 00:43:11.70
It was kind of, there's, so there's that woman who's the civilian that handles the detailing.

786
00:43:11.70 --> 00:43:16.86
But then there's a, there's a seal officer that would kind of work with her side by side.

787
00:43:16.86 --> 00:43:18.82
And he would get rotated out every couple years.

788
00:43:18.82 --> 00:43:21.90
Well, when 9-11 happened, I knew that guy.

789
00:43:21.90 --> 00:43:24.10
And he was a guy that I had worked for.

790
00:43:24.10 --> 00:43:25.50
He was an officer and he was a great guy.

791
00:43:25.50 --> 00:43:26.78
And I had a lot of respect for him.

792
00:43:26.78 --> 00:43:27.98
And we got along very well.

793
00:43:27.98 --> 00:43:31.50
And as soon as 9-11 happened, I called him and said, hey, you know, I was going to college

794
00:43:31.50 --> 00:43:34.54
at the time, I said, sir, please give me a college sent me back to, so he backed her team

795
00:43:34.54 --> 00:43:35.54
right now.

796
00:43:35.54 --> 00:43:36.54
I don't need to college.

797
00:43:36.54 --> 00:43:38.54
I'll finish it online or whatever.

798
00:43:38.54 --> 00:43:40.66
As it just, please give me back to your team.

799
00:43:40.66 --> 00:43:43.50
And, you know, he said, listen, this war's going to last long time.

800
00:43:43.50 --> 00:43:48.14
But I was having a conversation with him a few months ago with him and his wife actually.

801
00:43:48.14 --> 00:43:50.86
And I was saying, oh, yeah, and remember when I called you and I asked you, please send

802
00:43:50.86 --> 00:43:51.86
me.

803
00:43:51.86 --> 00:43:55.46
And he said, he said, everyone called him.

804
00:43:55.46 --> 00:43:57.30
And it made me feel like that's pretty awesome.

805
00:43:57.30 --> 00:44:01.22
Like it wasn't like, you know, I guess in my mind, I didn't think I was special, but in

806
00:44:01.22 --> 00:44:02.82
my mind, I thought, you know, I really wanted to go.

807
00:44:02.82 --> 00:44:04.22
So did everybody else.

808
00:44:04.22 --> 00:44:10.10
Every other seal that that wasn't in an out of seal team, everyone wanted to go.

809
00:44:10.10 --> 00:44:12.26
When the war happened, everyone wanted to go, do their part, you know.

810
00:44:12.26 --> 00:44:13.26
It's pretty cool.

811
00:44:13.26 --> 00:44:14.26
Yeah, absolutely.

812
00:44:14.26 --> 00:44:16.26
And he was right.

813
00:44:16.26 --> 00:44:19.02
The war lasted a lot longer than any of us thought it would.

814
00:44:19.02 --> 00:44:23.82
So you get your orders back to Vietnam.

815
00:44:23.82 --> 00:44:25.38
What'd you do with the car?

816
00:44:25.38 --> 00:44:27.98
Well, but I had a year, really, four, four, two.

817
00:44:27.98 --> 00:44:31.70
Trade it didn't got a little F-85, three speed on the column.

818
00:44:31.70 --> 00:44:33.82
This is survival vehicle.

819
00:44:33.82 --> 00:44:39.42
And so I just parked that and that took care of it when I was gone.

820
00:44:39.42 --> 00:44:44.86
And so I went back, I just went home and said, hey, I'm going back to normal.

821
00:44:44.86 --> 00:44:46.14
I had no leave time.

822
00:44:46.14 --> 00:44:48.90
I could have burned it all up previously.

823
00:44:48.90 --> 00:44:54.06
And so I went home and broke my mom's heart and told that I'm going back to my sister

824
00:44:54.06 --> 00:44:56.54
rammy to the airport the next day.

825
00:44:56.54 --> 00:44:59.66
And then I went back to heading back to Vietnam.

826
00:44:59.66 --> 00:45:02.42
Yeah, your mom must have been.

827
00:45:02.42 --> 00:45:04.42
What did your dad think?

828
00:45:04.42 --> 00:45:07.42
Well, dad was, I'll support you son.

829
00:45:07.42 --> 00:45:09.42
And he was, to his credit.

830
00:45:09.42 --> 00:45:11.42
He never had an opinion.

831
00:45:11.42 --> 00:45:15.82
Never asked an foreign opinion because he had the firm at the war.

832
00:45:15.82 --> 00:45:19.02
Family deferment because he had to run the family business.

833
00:45:19.02 --> 00:45:20.78
And then my uncle flew over the hump.

834
00:45:20.78 --> 00:45:23.02
So we had family service.

835
00:45:23.02 --> 00:45:26.42
And he said, good luck.

836
00:45:26.42 --> 00:45:28.34
If you need anything, let us know.

837
00:45:28.34 --> 00:45:32.62
And my mom was just like, she's a little bit more emotional, but tough old farm growth

838
00:45:32.62 --> 00:45:34.98
from Central Jersey, that's farm growing now.

839
00:45:34.98 --> 00:45:39.38
And even then did they know anything about what your last deployment was like?

840
00:45:39.38 --> 00:45:40.38
No.

841
00:45:40.38 --> 00:45:42.42
No, we never talked about it.

842
00:45:42.42 --> 00:45:43.42
Just glad you're home.

843
00:45:43.42 --> 00:45:44.42
Yep, glad to be home.

844
00:45:44.42 --> 00:45:49.06
Was it that no idea what kind of situation you'd been in?

845
00:45:49.06 --> 00:45:51.30
No, we really couldn't talk about it.

846
00:45:51.30 --> 00:45:58.18
And like, if I missed as you were not on air, but many years later, my dad

847
00:45:58.18 --> 00:46:01.74
came up to me and said, you know, I've finally read across the fence and it says, now I

848
00:46:01.74 --> 00:46:06.70
know why this guy came by and took our trash.

849
00:46:06.70 --> 00:46:10.70
So he said, yeah, so they got to those guys with tall black guy who come by and pick

850
00:46:10.70 --> 00:46:12.26
up our trash.

851
00:46:12.26 --> 00:46:17.54
So he had to be from the FBI because they were checking my trash to see if I wrote anything.

852
00:46:17.54 --> 00:46:21.78
That was a violation of the agreement that we signed in the name.

853
00:46:21.78 --> 00:46:23.42
The 20-year agreement.

854
00:46:23.42 --> 00:46:24.42
You won't talk about it.

855
00:46:24.42 --> 00:46:25.42
It won't write about it.

856
00:46:25.42 --> 00:46:26.94
They checked you on your ears.

857
00:46:26.94 --> 00:46:31.50
So dad and he just got picked up to transport and once could dad recognize her, he saw

858
00:46:31.50 --> 00:46:34.50
him down at the post office, wasn't nearly FBI officer.

859
00:46:34.50 --> 00:46:39.30
He figured, oh, that FBI guy's checking on my Johnny.

860
00:46:39.30 --> 00:46:42.06
That's sidebar.

861
00:46:42.06 --> 00:46:47.46
Yeah, that's kind of crazy that they're putting all that effort to do that.

862
00:46:47.46 --> 00:46:53.30
And yet you're out pump and gas.

863
00:46:53.30 --> 00:46:55.02
But that crazy to me.

864
00:46:55.02 --> 00:46:56.02
Yeah.

865
00:46:56.02 --> 00:46:58.66
But I gave a great new job, though, buddy.

866
00:46:58.66 --> 00:47:00.78
You could have your job, your grease you need.

867
00:47:00.78 --> 00:47:02.10
That's awesome.

868
00:47:02.10 --> 00:47:04.10
Yeah, that's crazy.

869
00:47:04.10 --> 00:47:11.30
You know, I guess when I'm older now, like you know, when I was a kid, I worked at

870
00:47:11.30 --> 00:47:12.30
fast food restaurants.

871
00:47:12.30 --> 00:47:13.30
You know what I mean?

872
00:47:13.30 --> 00:47:16.26
And now I think, man, I would not want to do that right now.

873
00:47:16.26 --> 00:47:20.30
No, it's the funny thing was I had a little 25, like the little brownie 25, always

874
00:47:20.30 --> 00:47:21.30
carrying my pocket.

875
00:47:21.30 --> 00:47:22.30
This was Boston.

876
00:47:22.30 --> 00:47:25.10
There's still some people that were like less than friendly up there.

877
00:47:25.10 --> 00:47:27.10
I said, I hope I get robbed.

878
00:47:27.10 --> 00:47:29.98
I just want to kill me or rob her.

879
00:47:29.98 --> 00:47:32.42
But that didn't happen, so.

880
00:47:32.42 --> 00:47:33.74
Well, what did happen?

881
00:47:33.74 --> 00:47:35.18
We got you back of Vietnam.

882
00:47:35.18 --> 00:47:36.18
Indeed.

883
00:47:36.18 --> 00:47:39.38
So you get back to Vietnam.

884
00:47:39.38 --> 00:47:40.38
Go back to the book.

885
00:47:40.38 --> 00:47:46.98
You're the casualty rates for saw-greecon teams, with a highest for any unit in Vietnam.

886
00:47:46.98 --> 00:47:48.18
We all had our close calls.

887
00:47:48.18 --> 00:47:52.74
And thus, each of us was given ample opportunity for the truth of this observation to be

888
00:47:52.74 --> 00:47:56.30
incised on his soul.

889
00:47:56.30 --> 00:48:04.26
None perhaps so, more so than the young, hard-charging one-zero of RT Michigan, Sergeant

890
00:48:04.26 --> 00:48:10.70
Elden Bargewell, no one who ever met him doubted his professionalism or determination.

891
00:48:10.70 --> 00:48:14.90
He was not only meticulous when preparing his team for a mission, and a fearless leader

892
00:48:14.90 --> 00:48:16.14
went on the ground.

893
00:48:16.14 --> 00:48:22.94
But he also possessed a biting wit and an absolute intolerance when it came to fools and

894
00:48:22.94 --> 00:48:28.62
ramps, fools and ramps being a redundancy to his way of thinking.

895
00:48:28.62 --> 00:48:39.02
So this was interesting because you talk about Bargewell and in the story that you tell,

896
00:48:39.02 --> 00:48:43.62
they're out on an op and he finds a vest in AK-47 vest and he wants it.

897
00:48:43.62 --> 00:48:46.86
He wants the AK, he just found them laying around and a bunker or something.

898
00:48:46.86 --> 00:48:52.38
So he puts on the vest and he gives the AK to one of his in-dage guys and then he ends

899
00:48:52.38 --> 00:48:58.30
up getting shot in the chest and that vest actually saved his life because it hit one

900
00:48:58.30 --> 00:49:00.38
of the magazines that was in the vest.

901
00:49:00.38 --> 00:49:01.38
Correct.

902
00:49:01.38 --> 00:49:02.38
Crazy story.

903
00:49:02.38 --> 00:49:09.58
And what was interesting, so when I was in Germany in 1998, I was stationed at Naval Special

904
00:49:09.58 --> 00:49:17.50
Warfare Unit 2 just outside of Stuttgart and my boss, who is the commander of Naval Special

905
00:49:17.50 --> 00:49:22.66
Warfare Unit 2, he obviously directed to the guy that was in charge of Special Operations

906
00:49:22.66 --> 00:49:24.46
Command Europe.

907
00:49:24.46 --> 00:49:29.74
And my boss, who I had a ton of respect for who's a incredible guy, a great guy, and taught

908
00:49:29.74 --> 00:49:36.94
me a ton, he would tell me, hey, the uses of command are this guy, he's awesome, his

909
00:49:36.94 --> 00:49:37.94
name is Bargewell.

910
00:49:37.94 --> 00:49:43.46
You would tell me stories about he just absolutely loved Bargewell and talked about him

911
00:49:43.46 --> 00:49:46.94
with the highest respect possible.

912
00:49:46.94 --> 00:49:50.90
And it was awesome and I knew about Bargewell.

913
00:49:50.90 --> 00:49:56.14
I mean, I basically learned about him initially from him, but then later on, yeah, I

914
00:49:56.14 --> 00:50:01.82
would read about him, small world and what a great guy was and what an epic soldier

915
00:50:01.82 --> 00:50:03.50
he was and what a great example.

916
00:50:03.50 --> 00:50:07.70
You know, so many people say he's the one of the foremost examples of how you'd want

917
00:50:07.70 --> 00:50:12.74
to be as a soldier, just a great guy and I was lucky enough to have a degree of connection

918
00:50:12.74 --> 00:50:17.54
to have my boss work for him and he must have been, he must have been a two star at

919
00:50:17.54 --> 00:50:18.54
the time.

920
00:50:18.54 --> 00:50:19.54
I think it was a two star at the time.

921
00:50:19.54 --> 00:50:24.18
At the time, so there he was and I think he did 40 something years, almost 40,

922
00:50:24.18 --> 00:50:26.42
yeah, a couple months shy.

923
00:50:26.42 --> 00:50:28.70
Yeah.

924
00:50:28.70 --> 00:50:32.26
So that's pretty awesome to read about Bargewell.

925
00:50:32.26 --> 00:50:35.94
Oh, yeah.

926
00:50:35.94 --> 00:50:39.42
You get to this point here where you're talking about how crazy.

927
00:50:39.42 --> 00:50:44.38
And I often try and explain how and combat unexpected things happen.

928
00:50:44.38 --> 00:50:48.58
Things that you can't make it up, things happen are so crazy.

929
00:50:48.58 --> 00:50:53.10
And you've got a section in here where you're talking about Lynn Black, who's your run

930
00:50:53.10 --> 00:50:54.82
and mate for a long time.

931
00:50:54.82 --> 00:50:57.02
Yeah, then when I left, he took over the team.

932
00:50:57.02 --> 00:51:03.18
When I came back, I went on a team then he probably went up to speed about the A.O. had

933
00:51:03.18 --> 00:51:04.74
changed in five months.

934
00:51:04.74 --> 00:51:05.74
Yeah.

935
00:51:05.74 --> 00:51:08.06
And then we took turns and then they said, hey, you guys got too much experience.

936
00:51:08.06 --> 00:51:13.14
So Lynn went to the Dismore Snooping and pooping and then I took over right to Hogan.

937
00:51:13.14 --> 00:51:15.38
And this is when he's solo on the ground.

938
00:51:15.38 --> 00:51:16.38
Or he's you're not there.

939
00:51:16.38 --> 00:51:18.70
He's not solo, but he's with his team.

940
00:51:18.70 --> 00:51:21.34
He's in Louss and they're on patrol.

941
00:51:21.34 --> 00:51:26.98
They're deep in enemy territory, which is just like just the way you guys rolled.

942
00:51:26.98 --> 00:51:30.50
And the team starts to hear people following them.

943
00:51:30.50 --> 00:51:34.10
And now they start stepping up their pace, they're trying to move, they're trying to do things

944
00:51:34.10 --> 00:51:38.38
to disguise their trail and all that.

945
00:51:38.38 --> 00:51:41.10
And finally, they really like, OK, we're definitely getting followed.

946
00:51:41.10 --> 00:51:44.06
If the two days, after two days of being followed.

947
00:51:44.06 --> 00:51:45.22
And so here we go, go back to the book.

948
00:51:45.22 --> 00:51:50.74
However, before Black could give the word to change course, the noise is suddenly returned.

949
00:51:50.74 --> 00:51:55.38
Only now it sounded as though a large number of enemy soldiers was headed straight for them

950
00:51:55.38 --> 00:51:58.70
and the troops were not in the least trying to hide their movement.

951
00:51:58.70 --> 00:51:59.70
This is it.

952
00:51:59.70 --> 00:52:03.42
Fault Black, the trackers have linked with reinforcements and they're about to try and overrun

953
00:52:03.42 --> 00:52:04.42
us.

954
00:52:04.42 --> 00:52:10.26
He immediately told the team to head for the ridge, form a line, and get ready for a fight.

955
00:52:10.26 --> 00:52:16.50
Claymore mines were putting quickly into place and Black dug out the radio handset in anticipation

956
00:52:16.50 --> 00:52:18.30
of calling Covey.

957
00:52:18.30 --> 00:52:23.74
Black was totally convinced he would soon be declaring a prairie fire emergency.

958
00:52:23.74 --> 00:52:26.58
Black when Black was with RT Alabama.

959
00:52:26.58 --> 00:52:32.82
He had faced a massive frontal assault waves by determined NVA, so he knew what to expect

960
00:52:32.82 --> 00:52:35.50
and he knew what needed to be done.

961
00:52:35.50 --> 00:52:40.54
Having moved the team up onto the ridge line, he knew he had the tactical advantage.

962
00:52:40.54 --> 00:52:44.74
If the enemy wanted a bloody fight and it certainly sounded as though they did, the NVA

963
00:52:44.74 --> 00:52:49.18
could charge uphill and RT Idaho would give it to them.

964
00:52:49.18 --> 00:52:53.62
Everyone in place that weapons on full automatic and begun and unbending the metal pins

965
00:52:53.62 --> 00:52:55.26
on their hand grenades.

966
00:52:55.26 --> 00:52:59.30
The ends were bent in order to keep the pins from accidentally being pulled to the ring

967
00:52:59.30 --> 00:53:01.94
and hang up on a branch or something else.

968
00:53:01.94 --> 00:53:07.06
High explosive rounds in the M79 were replaced with rounds containing large buckshot, capable

969
00:53:07.06 --> 00:53:11.38
of blasting a devastating hole in the enemy's ranks.

970
00:53:11.38 --> 00:53:16.38
With everything in place and ready, RT Idaho faced the jungle and waited for whatever

971
00:53:16.38 --> 00:53:18.58
was coming.

972
00:53:18.58 --> 00:53:22.86
The Frenchman caught sight of something approaching, but the vegetation was such that he

973
00:53:22.86 --> 00:53:24.86
couldn't get a clean shot at it.

974
00:53:24.86 --> 00:53:28.18
He figured it was someone moving in a crouch because it only stood about four feet off

975
00:53:28.18 --> 00:53:29.18
the ground.

976
00:53:29.18 --> 00:53:34.14
He could see other similarly poised figures behind it, all moving noiseily toward

977
00:53:34.14 --> 00:53:35.14
the team.

978
00:53:35.14 --> 00:53:39.66
And if you more feet, they would reach a point where the jungle fined out and he'd

979
00:53:39.66 --> 00:53:41.78
figured he'd have a good shot at them.

980
00:53:41.78 --> 00:53:48.42
Like any recon man, the torno had fought about such a moment, the moment when an outnumbered

981
00:53:48.42 --> 00:53:51.82
team was forced to make a stand.

982
00:53:51.82 --> 00:53:58.94
Plus, like all the other RT Idaho members, he was very tense but ready for anything.

983
00:53:58.94 --> 00:54:02.58
Anything that is, but what stepped into the clearing.

984
00:54:02.58 --> 00:54:04.50
He couldn't believe his eyes.

985
00:54:04.50 --> 00:54:11.82
He found himself staring not an oriental gentleman in Pith Helmets armed with AK-47s,

986
00:54:11.82 --> 00:54:17.18
but long-armed, hairy, reddish-oranged creatures with a decidedly human features.

987
00:54:17.18 --> 00:54:20.70
It was a small band of orangutans, probably a family of them.

988
00:54:20.70 --> 00:54:24.74
They had been tracking the team out of natural curiosity trying to figure out what these

989
00:54:24.74 --> 00:54:27.70
hairless apes were up to in their territory.

990
00:54:27.70 --> 00:54:28.70
Yeah.

991
00:54:28.70 --> 00:54:29.70
Oh yeah.

992
00:54:29.70 --> 00:54:35.70
That's probably the happiest monkeys they ever saw.

993
00:54:35.70 --> 00:54:37.70
Oh yeah, can you imagine?

994
00:54:37.70 --> 00:54:38.70
Yeah.

995
00:54:38.70 --> 00:54:41.70
For sure.

996
00:54:41.70 --> 00:54:45.02
I was in Sri Lanka and we got to see that.

997
00:54:45.02 --> 00:54:49.34
They would hear them coming and they would be moving through the trees and it was really

998
00:54:49.34 --> 00:54:50.34
cool.

999
00:54:50.34 --> 00:54:51.34
Yeah, just out.

1000
00:54:51.34 --> 00:54:54.74
But yeah, you'd hear all this noise and it would be a bunch of monkeys coming through

1001
00:54:54.74 --> 00:54:55.74
the trees.

1002
00:54:55.74 --> 00:54:57.74
And we had that right on the floor.

1003
00:54:57.74 --> 00:54:58.74
Yeah.

1004
00:54:58.74 --> 00:54:59.74
We got online.

1005
00:54:59.74 --> 00:55:02.34
We were ready for the assault and it's like we got overrun by monkeys.

1006
00:55:02.34 --> 00:55:04.34
All right.

1007
00:55:04.34 --> 00:55:09.22
Now we're getting to the point where you, so that was, that was Lynn Blackwork and on

1008
00:55:09.22 --> 00:55:11.10
his own and now we're getting when you returned.

1009
00:55:11.10 --> 00:55:16.06
When I returned to CCN at the end of October 1969, I immediately reported to Sergeant

1010
00:55:16.06 --> 00:55:20.02
Major John Hobbs and asked if I could rejoin RT Idaho.

1011
00:55:20.02 --> 00:55:25.18
He said that, let's turn know, had just completed his torn return, state side.

1012
00:55:25.18 --> 00:55:28.42
There was an opening for an American and I could fill it.

1013
00:55:28.42 --> 00:55:34.18
But Lynn M. Blackt Jr. is still the one zero and you two are both experienced to one

1014
00:55:34.18 --> 00:55:35.18
zero.

1015
00:55:35.18 --> 00:55:38.06
I reminded him that I'd been away for five months and needed some time to get back

1016
00:55:38.06 --> 00:55:39.34
in the flow of things.

1017
00:55:39.34 --> 00:55:43.66
I added I'd be happy to serve as Blacks one one for a while because I respected his

1018
00:55:43.66 --> 00:55:45.54
judgment.

1019
00:55:45.54 --> 00:55:50.18
As I put now you go and meet with the team as I approach, I saw Black and Salle leading

1020
00:55:50.18 --> 00:55:51.54
the team away from the range.

1021
00:55:51.54 --> 00:55:55.66
Once they caught sight of me, their faces lit up and there was a rush of feelings of

1022
00:55:55.66 --> 00:55:56.98
greetings.

1023
00:55:56.98 --> 00:56:02.02
As I shook Blacks hands, hand the teams surrounded us dancing about almost like children

1024
00:56:02.02 --> 00:56:06.66
and the good nature taunts instantly began flowing hot and heavy.

1025
00:56:06.66 --> 00:56:12.82
The gross insult being one of the most accepted ways a recon man can show affection.

1026
00:56:12.82 --> 00:56:17.38
I was subjected to a whole litany of them aimed at everything from my intelligence to my

1027
00:56:17.38 --> 00:56:19.38
sexual orientation.

1028
00:56:19.38 --> 00:56:23.86
In the midst of it all, Black totally cool as usual asked if I was back on the team.

1029
00:56:23.86 --> 00:56:26.82
Yes, Sergeant, I replied, I'm reporting for duty.

1030
00:56:26.82 --> 00:56:29.14
I'm a new one one.

1031
00:56:29.14 --> 00:56:33.10
I know more about the team, the AO and the bullshit in camp.

1032
00:56:33.10 --> 00:56:39.34
Oh, it's our you know more about the team, the AO and the bullshit here in camp than I do.

1033
00:56:39.34 --> 00:56:44.22
I want I want to black to understand I was willingly putting myself under his command and

1034
00:56:44.22 --> 00:56:49.18
that my goal was not to challenge him but to learn from him a recon man who thinks he

1035
00:56:49.18 --> 00:56:52.62
knows it all is a recon man headed for trouble.

1036
00:56:52.62 --> 00:56:59.18
And if I could capture those, that attitude right there and distill it among every person

1037
00:56:59.18 --> 00:57:01.38
that's moving into a leadership position.

1038
00:57:01.38 --> 00:57:06.22
Like this, the humility that you show here, the willingness to subordinate your own ego

1039
00:57:06.22 --> 00:57:12.14
is like the best sign of a great leader when you check into a situation, oh you know what?

1040
00:57:12.14 --> 00:57:13.14
I don't know everything.

1041
00:57:13.14 --> 00:57:16.94
And by the way, if I think I know everything I'm wrong and oh there's someone that's

1042
00:57:16.94 --> 00:57:18.58
been here for a while, guess what?

1043
00:57:18.58 --> 00:57:20.30
Cool, I got no problem working for you.

1044
00:57:20.30 --> 00:57:24.50
I'm here to support, I'm here to look out for the team, I'm here to help the team win,

1045
00:57:24.50 --> 00:57:28.86
not here to look out for my own little agenda.

1046
00:57:28.86 --> 00:57:29.86
So that was awesome.

1047
00:57:29.86 --> 00:57:32.98
And that was been black, he's just an amazing man.

1048
00:57:32.98 --> 00:57:38.30
And so I totally respected him and it was glad that it worked out thanks to Bill L. Alexander

1049
00:57:38.30 --> 00:57:41.14
or his or cut, get over there pretty quick.

1050
00:57:41.14 --> 00:57:48.66
And with Lynn, he had done a tour duty with the 173 and he lost a brother there and he

1051
00:57:48.66 --> 00:57:54.74
still came back because he wanted to get fair share of an V.A. dead just to take some personal

1052
00:57:54.74 --> 00:57:56.14
revenge.

1053
00:57:56.14 --> 00:58:01.90
And you know, we had that mission where he came up against the 10,000 and survived

1054
00:58:01.90 --> 00:58:04.66
the Mason's, one of our amazing heroes.

1055
00:58:04.66 --> 00:58:10.82
And so yeah, I respected him and then later on we began, there's no SOP, the Sergeant

1056
00:58:10.82 --> 00:58:13.82
Major Hobbes, he has this to do in SOP.

1057
00:58:13.82 --> 00:58:20.02
Yeah, that sounds like that's something that we need to start doing the seal teams too.

1058
00:58:20.02 --> 00:58:24.78
There's another section in here where you start talking about, well it appeared to me and

1059
00:58:24.78 --> 00:58:27.06
we were actually talking about this before we started recording.

1060
00:58:27.06 --> 00:58:30.30
That's when you go to meet the new commander and here we go back to the book because

1061
00:58:30.30 --> 00:58:32.30
I hadn't met the C.C.N commander.

1062
00:58:32.30 --> 00:58:36.26
I polished my jump boots to spit shine, hoping they might make a positive impression when

1063
00:58:36.26 --> 00:58:39.34
I met him later that afternoon, the call came down to meet him.

1064
00:58:39.34 --> 00:58:43.82
I put on the last pair of starched fatigues I had in my possession, put on my new green

1065
00:58:43.82 --> 00:58:46.54
beret and the spit shine boots.

1066
00:58:46.54 --> 00:58:48.90
So there you go, you're getting squared away.

1067
00:58:48.90 --> 00:58:52.82
And again, this is one of those things where you're in your second tour of Vietnam, you

1068
00:58:52.82 --> 00:58:57.02
know, your NSF guy, you've been in all kinds of really tough situations, but you're going

1069
00:58:57.02 --> 00:58:58.02
to meet the commander.

1070
00:58:58.02 --> 00:59:03.26
So be humble, get squared away uniform on, try and make a good impression.

1071
00:59:03.26 --> 00:59:08.10
The commander of C.C.N made it a point to say that he ordered recon teams to break contact

1072
00:59:08.10 --> 00:59:11.30
with enemy forces and continue the mission.

1073
00:59:11.30 --> 00:59:15.66
I knew that several other recon teams had been unsuccessful in getting the tanker.

1074
00:59:15.66 --> 00:59:16.74
So this guy's a tanker.

1075
00:59:16.74 --> 00:59:17.74
This guy was a tanker.

1076
00:59:17.74 --> 00:59:21.82
I don't know, what do you want to give us a little briefing on what the new commander was

1077
00:59:21.82 --> 00:59:22.82
like?

1078
00:59:22.82 --> 00:59:28.80
Yeah, he was a sign there and he was a friend of General Crate Nebons, who was the overall

1079
00:59:28.80 --> 00:59:29.80
commander.

1080
00:59:29.80 --> 00:59:36.74
Averyns had seceded Westmoreland as the top commanding officer for all of Vietnam.

1081
00:59:36.74 --> 00:59:38.66
And he was one of his buddies.

1082
00:59:38.66 --> 00:59:45.94
And so in order to build up his career, Averyns sent into NSF unit so he could build up his

1083
00:59:45.94 --> 00:59:47.82
medals, get to time.

1084
00:59:47.82 --> 00:59:52.66
And at that time in the army, if you serve the special forces, but long in six months,

1085
00:59:52.66 --> 00:59:54.54
that has an officer your career was done.

1086
00:59:54.54 --> 00:59:59.66
You would not get to promote the West Pointers and the other guys that we get, your career

1087
00:59:59.66 --> 01:00:00.86
was a finnist.

1088
01:00:00.86 --> 01:00:05.22
But if you had a certain amount of time and he came up there, which we learned later, was

1089
01:00:05.22 --> 01:00:08.26
to build his medal portfolio.

1090
01:00:08.26 --> 01:00:10.74
And we had some other stories that go on later on.

1091
01:00:10.74 --> 01:00:18.46
So he never really adjusted nor did he apparently understand NSF and the way we worked, particularly

1092
01:00:18.46 --> 01:00:19.86
on the recon teams.

1093
01:00:19.86 --> 01:00:25.46
And the whole thing about break contact, and team mission, will serve, if you're with

1094
01:00:25.46 --> 01:00:29.18
me on the ground, you want to say that, that's cool.

1095
01:00:29.18 --> 01:00:32.26
But if you're up there, 5,000 feet and telling me to break contact, and team mission

1096
01:00:32.26 --> 01:00:36.02
with a six-man recon team, we got 10,000 guys and one of the party.

1097
01:00:36.02 --> 01:00:39.46
No, but I won't, you can't quite say it that way.

1098
01:00:39.46 --> 01:00:41.94
So you're going to extreme PC mode.

1099
01:00:41.94 --> 01:00:42.94
Yeah.

1100
01:00:42.94 --> 01:00:44.94
And we're just meeting each other too.

1101
01:00:44.94 --> 01:00:50.94
Yeah, I heard he was lacking compared to this previous commander we had here.

1102
01:00:50.94 --> 01:00:51.94
Yeah.

1103
01:00:51.94 --> 01:00:55.98
And the idea, I think it's patents said the commander in the field is always right, which

1104
01:00:55.98 --> 01:01:00.54
is a great thing to lean towards from your perspective when you're up at 5,000 feet

1105
01:01:00.54 --> 01:01:03.90
or back in its act of cooperation center, you've got to assume that your guy in the field

1106
01:01:03.90 --> 01:01:06.46
is making a right call and trying to support him.

1107
01:01:06.46 --> 01:01:11.50
And there's so many times where I read the stories that you write or stories of the other

1108
01:01:11.50 --> 01:01:13.26
guys that you're writing about.

1109
01:01:13.26 --> 01:01:20.58
The difference between the team being overrun and killed is a minute.

1110
01:01:20.58 --> 01:01:21.58
It's two minutes.

1111
01:01:21.58 --> 01:01:22.98
Sometimes it's seconds.

1112
01:01:22.98 --> 01:01:27.42
It's like these other time when you got when the fire, as you're taking off, the fire

1113
01:01:27.42 --> 01:01:30.70
consumes the area we're just, and that's followed by the NVA.

1114
01:01:30.70 --> 01:01:36.98
So often these situations as soon as they started to go bad even in the slightest way, it's

1115
01:01:36.98 --> 01:01:39.50
like, okay, we got to start figuring out how we're going to be out of here.

1116
01:01:39.50 --> 01:01:43.90
Because if we try and fight by the time we make the decision, so if you try to do this

1117
01:01:43.90 --> 01:01:50.18
idea of his, which is break contact and then continue the mission, I mean, you, is it really

1118
01:01:50.18 --> 01:01:53.38
possible for you to break, so you lose a bunch of your ammo?

1119
01:01:53.38 --> 01:01:54.38
What do you figure?

1120
01:01:54.38 --> 01:01:57.02
A third of your ammo, half of your ammo in a quick gunfight.

1121
01:01:57.02 --> 01:01:59.46
And now you think the enemy is just going to walk away.

1122
01:01:59.46 --> 01:02:04.22
And the fundamental flaw here is this is a secret mission.

1123
01:02:04.22 --> 01:02:06.26
It's a planned test on operation.

1124
01:02:06.26 --> 01:02:10.82
If you may contact with the enemy, quote, you've been compromised, but somehow that didn't

1125
01:02:10.82 --> 01:02:12.58
compute with the tanker.

1126
01:02:12.58 --> 01:02:13.58
Yeah.

1127
01:02:13.58 --> 01:02:17.30
So you're in there, you're talking to him, and here we go back to the book.

1128
01:02:17.30 --> 01:02:21.44
I knew that several other recon team members had been unsuccessful in getting the tanker

1129
01:02:21.44 --> 01:02:24.42
to change his mind on that topic, so I approached it from a different angle.

1130
01:02:24.42 --> 01:02:28.34
I asked him to place himself in the one zeros position in the field because most of the

1131
01:02:28.34 --> 01:02:32.66
one zeros I knew would do anything within their power to successfully complete a mission.

1132
01:02:32.66 --> 01:02:35.50
If the tactical situation was conducive to it.

1133
01:02:35.50 --> 01:02:40.54
But once compromised, it was often militarily difficult to do so with a six man recon team

1134
01:02:40.54 --> 01:02:43.98
against large numbers of NVA soldiers.

1135
01:02:43.98 --> 01:02:46.02
He promised me to think more on the topic.

1136
01:02:46.02 --> 01:02:50.78
I saluted and returned to the team room, Leary of the New CEO.

1137
01:02:50.78 --> 01:02:57.10
So you did even at a young age, you had the kind of understanding, maybe I'm not going

1138
01:02:57.10 --> 01:02:59.50
to approach things head on.

1139
01:02:59.50 --> 01:03:02.06
Hey, you're not trying to answer your dome.

1140
01:03:02.06 --> 01:03:03.06
That's a bad idea.

1141
01:03:03.06 --> 01:03:07.26
I was like, hey, you know, sir, from my perspective as a one zeros, what we see, it's

1142
01:03:07.26 --> 01:03:08.10
a little bit different.

1143
01:03:08.10 --> 01:03:12.06
I just was impressed with the fact that you were playing the game a little bit, trying

1144
01:03:12.06 --> 01:03:14.58
to build a relationship with this guy, trying to fight on his own.

1145
01:03:14.58 --> 01:03:17.62
I was fighting with Spiderman Park, some Pat Walkers, that that would be one.

1146
01:03:17.62 --> 01:03:21.18
We had a couple officers there that really dickheads in the beginning.

1147
01:03:21.18 --> 01:03:26.82
When they took over command, they would be making bad decisions and didn't understand

1148
01:03:26.82 --> 01:03:32.42
a situation, but at least majority of the senior officers, meaning a major or a lieutenant

1149
01:03:32.42 --> 01:03:34.42
or a criminal or a case.

1150
01:03:34.42 --> 01:03:38.46
Majority, once they've been there and saw what we were up against in the field, it just

1151
01:03:38.46 --> 01:03:39.46
took a while.

1152
01:03:39.46 --> 01:03:42.66
It's that little time gap from when they land, they want to prove they're a hard ass, they

1153
01:03:42.66 --> 01:03:46.66
want to be a good CEO, and they've got to worry about their career too.

1154
01:03:46.66 --> 01:03:51.54
And between that reality and what we're dealing with on the ground, and usually most of

1155
01:03:51.54 --> 01:03:56.10
them came around, this guy was not one of those that was, it didn't have that capability.

1156
01:03:56.10 --> 01:03:59.66
You're just seeing it in his own perspective.

1157
01:03:59.66 --> 01:04:04.74
Yeah, I learned from the pros, you know, Spiderman, Pat Walkers, John McGarvern, these are

1158
01:04:04.74 --> 01:04:10.58
all senior NCOs, and I watched them in situations dealing with sergeant majors and S3,

1159
01:04:10.58 --> 01:04:15.78
particularly on mission stuff, before the mission, and afterwards, how they would talk.

1160
01:04:15.78 --> 01:04:23.26
And I picked up a lot of, I like to think I endured some of their PC skills because I had none.

1161
01:04:23.26 --> 01:04:26.66
And what would you say that goal was from a leadership perspective as you're talking

1162
01:04:26.66 --> 01:04:27.66
to these guys?

1163
01:04:27.66 --> 01:04:32.22
I always say, look, if I got a boss, my goal is to try and form a relationship with

1164
01:04:32.22 --> 01:04:34.10
me so that he listens to what I'm saying.

1165
01:04:34.10 --> 01:04:37.46
Because if I go on and butt heads out of the gate, they're not going to listen to me.

1166
01:04:37.46 --> 01:04:41.02
If I tell this boss, this tanker, hey, you don't know what you're talking about.

1167
01:04:41.02 --> 01:04:43.74
Well, he's not going to listen to another word, I say.

1168
01:04:43.74 --> 01:04:47.74
But if I say, hey, sir, Roger that, I want to give you some perspective on this that

1169
01:04:47.74 --> 01:04:51.38
I've, you know, whatever, just trying to talk to them with respectfully trying to build a

1170
01:04:51.38 --> 01:04:52.38
relationship.

1171
01:04:52.38 --> 01:04:53.38
That's what I try to do.

1172
01:04:53.38 --> 01:04:57.62
Yeah, with the CO, just try to stay away from deal the sergeant major, because

1173
01:04:57.62 --> 01:05:01.70
they've been all been on the ground, they had experience and they appreciate what we're

1174
01:05:01.70 --> 01:05:02.70
doing.

1175
01:05:02.70 --> 01:05:07.44
Any new what we're doing day by day, our sergeant majors were squared away with a

1176
01:05:07.44 --> 01:05:10.54
exceptional one, but most of them was I dulled.

1177
01:05:10.54 --> 01:05:11.54
And we're just really lucky.

1178
01:05:11.54 --> 01:05:17.90
So I try to deal with them, keep the CO site, stay away from us a best way.

1179
01:05:17.90 --> 01:05:18.90
Officer avoidance.

1180
01:05:18.90 --> 01:05:19.90
Officer avoidance.

1181
01:05:19.90 --> 01:05:22.18
That's a good one.

1182
01:05:22.18 --> 01:05:25.50
Uh, moving forward a little bit.

1183
01:05:25.50 --> 01:05:28.58
And the late afternoon as Black and I went over the final mission preparations,

1184
01:05:28.58 --> 01:05:31.34
Jenkins came running into our hooch with bad news.

1185
01:05:31.34 --> 01:05:35.34
RT Maryland has been hit, Walton Browner down.

1186
01:05:35.34 --> 01:05:37.30
Jesus H Christ, I can't believe it.

1187
01:05:37.30 --> 01:05:41.14
Walton told me they, that they told him it was a dry hole.

1188
01:05:41.14 --> 01:05:42.90
Give me your PRC 25.

1189
01:05:42.90 --> 01:05:48.94
Someone said they heard Brown on the radio as I screwed the long antenna into the PRC 25.

1190
01:05:48.94 --> 01:05:52.34
Black asked Jenkins, and he worked on the bright light team.

1191
01:05:52.34 --> 01:05:57.14
He turned to me with the frown on his face, no word yet, replied Jenkins, but I want

1192
01:05:57.14 --> 01:05:59.38
to go if there is one.

1193
01:05:59.38 --> 01:06:03.78
We all moved outside to get better radio reception on our FM radios.

1194
01:06:03.78 --> 01:06:05.58
The news got worse.

1195
01:06:05.58 --> 01:06:08.86
Jenkins said he could hear Kavie talking to Brown.

1196
01:06:08.86 --> 01:06:13.10
All the Americans were down and being overrun.

1197
01:06:13.10 --> 01:06:17.94
Jenkins said he heard Kavie's last conversation with Brown when a wounded Brown told

1198
01:06:17.94 --> 01:06:21.30
Kavie they were being overrun.

1199
01:06:21.30 --> 01:06:27.10
He said he heard AK 47 firing, and then there was radio silence.

1200
01:06:27.10 --> 01:06:32.10
All communications with RT Maryland were lost.

1201
01:06:32.10 --> 01:06:37.82
The weather over the target closed in, precluding any bright light missions for 10 days.

1202
01:06:37.82 --> 01:06:42.42
When a bright light finally went in, team members found only American web gear near the

1203
01:06:42.42 --> 01:06:45.86
last loan location of RT Maryland.

1204
01:06:45.86 --> 01:06:50.58
No further evidence of the team was ever located.

1205
01:06:50.58 --> 01:06:57.82
All Brown and Sergeant Donald Monroe shoe, the newly appointed team member, who listed as

1206
01:06:57.82 --> 01:07:01.26
presumptive killed in action.

1207
01:07:01.26 --> 01:07:06.38
The loss of walled Brown and shoe was a reminder of just how deadly the AO continued to

1208
01:07:06.38 --> 01:07:08.74
be in sag.

1209
01:07:08.74 --> 01:07:13.18
As always, the recon men talked to each other afterward to see if there were any lessons

1210
01:07:13.18 --> 01:07:16.62
to be learned from their loss.

1211
01:07:16.62 --> 01:07:21.10
The weather was bad, Sergeant Major John Hobb suggested to black myself in a few others

1212
01:07:21.10 --> 01:07:26.98
in recon that perhaps a recon book should be written containing and documenting the team's

1213
01:07:26.98 --> 01:07:29.38
standard operating procedures.

1214
01:07:29.38 --> 01:07:31.02
So there you go.

1215
01:07:31.02 --> 01:07:32.26
That's when you got started on that.

1216
01:07:32.26 --> 01:07:34.26
Yeah, I was caught by those.

1217
01:07:34.26 --> 01:07:35.26
Lim was a phenomenal.

1218
01:07:35.26 --> 01:07:37.38
He is a phenomenal artist.

1219
01:07:37.38 --> 01:07:42.98
So he would do a lot of sketches and then we worked on every SOP from everything from just

1220
01:07:42.98 --> 01:07:44.94
getting pre-mission.

1221
01:07:44.94 --> 01:07:49.94
And what you would carry, break it down between the Americans, the adage, batteries,

1222
01:07:49.94 --> 01:07:56.30
claim orders, five second fuses, and then adapting to the AO you're going in.

1223
01:07:56.30 --> 01:07:58.30
Some of the areas in the layoffs, they had a lot of water.

1224
01:07:58.30 --> 01:08:02.82
So you only carry one canteen of water and purification pills.

1225
01:08:02.82 --> 01:08:06.98
Other times, if it was dry, you had to carry more water, which is more weight.

1226
01:08:06.98 --> 01:08:12.46
So always try to stay low as a possible on that as one of the fluctuation weight factors

1227
01:08:12.46 --> 01:08:15.50
that we can have some control over.

1228
01:08:15.50 --> 01:08:17.46
How much were you usually carrying?

1229
01:08:17.46 --> 01:08:21.26
At least 80 to 90 pounds back then.

1230
01:08:21.26 --> 01:08:23.98
And we were waiting for your body weight.

1231
01:08:23.98 --> 01:08:27.86
I think it was about 170, so can we weigh?

1232
01:08:27.86 --> 01:08:31.58
Maybe 175, but the most after all on our.

1233
01:08:31.58 --> 01:08:37.18
And you're carrying 80 pounds, 90 pounds?

1234
01:08:37.18 --> 01:08:38.18
Yeah.

1235
01:08:38.18 --> 01:08:43.34
I carried the radio plus the 600 plus rounds for the car.

1236
01:08:43.34 --> 01:08:46.82
I'm sitting on the rounds and the flag grenades.

1237
01:08:46.82 --> 01:08:48.58
And you guys know, we're nobody armor.

1238
01:08:48.58 --> 01:08:50.50
Oh no, no helmet.

1239
01:08:50.50 --> 01:08:52.86
The body armor back then was this clunky stuff.

1240
01:08:52.86 --> 01:08:53.86
Yeah.

1241
01:08:53.86 --> 01:08:55.86
And the helmet was just made too much noise.

1242
01:08:55.86 --> 01:08:57.58
And it was weight.

1243
01:08:57.58 --> 01:09:01.10
And in the jungle, we just get caught up with stuff where I just would have crevat all

1244
01:09:01.10 --> 01:09:09.26
time and then try to cover my blonde hair.

1245
01:09:09.26 --> 01:09:16.02
Again, this is every time I read one of the stories that you write about, you made

1246
01:09:16.02 --> 01:09:17.02
it out.

1247
01:09:17.02 --> 01:09:21.86
You had that extra clay more that gave you enough time to get on the bird.

1248
01:09:21.86 --> 01:09:23.66
You laid down that extra fire.

1249
01:09:23.66 --> 01:09:28.98
The airships showed up in time to put down cover fire and hear with these guys with

1250
01:09:28.98 --> 01:09:31.74
our T-marinland, like those seconds didn't happen.

1251
01:09:31.74 --> 01:09:35.22
Those aircraft didn't show whatever the case may be.

1252
01:09:35.22 --> 01:09:38.22
And that's what was at stake every single time you went out there.

1253
01:09:38.22 --> 01:09:39.22
Right.

1254
01:09:39.22 --> 01:09:41.74
And just like we said in across the fence, all the Americans were killed.

1255
01:09:41.74 --> 01:09:43.70
The endage were left alive.

1256
01:09:43.70 --> 01:09:46.82
So they were hit by we assume sappers.

1257
01:09:46.82 --> 01:09:51.14
And with the endage, it's a psychological thing on all the troops in camp.

1258
01:09:51.14 --> 01:09:53.22
You had to deal with that again.

1259
01:09:53.22 --> 01:09:56.54
But like with my team, we just pulled the team together and said, hey, tell us what you

1260
01:09:56.54 --> 01:09:59.66
heard, we don't have a problem with you guys.

1261
01:09:59.66 --> 01:10:05.18
But what just happens, just be advised, keep linen eye, appraised of anything you hear

1262
01:10:05.18 --> 01:10:07.66
that could be negative or troublesome.

1263
01:10:07.66 --> 01:10:12.62
And we'll squalch it right away or deal with it.

1264
01:10:12.62 --> 01:10:15.34
In this case, did the endage make it out?

1265
01:10:15.34 --> 01:10:16.78
Or did it never heard from again?

1266
01:10:16.78 --> 01:10:18.94
No, two out of three made it out.

1267
01:10:18.94 --> 01:10:22.34
One was killed as they came out of the forest.

1268
01:10:22.34 --> 01:10:27.30
They were near a marine compound as some sort and because they were in ditch, when they came

1269
01:10:27.30 --> 01:10:30.58
out arm, the marine took them out.

1270
01:10:30.58 --> 01:10:35.74
And they are two were able to surround a surrender and make it gestures as some sort that

1271
01:10:35.74 --> 01:10:39.42
they were able to get picked up, came back and they took them down the side gone for the full

1272
01:10:39.42 --> 01:10:41.10
debrief and everything.

1273
01:10:41.10 --> 01:10:44.14
And did you guys ever get word on that debrief?

1274
01:10:44.14 --> 01:10:45.14
Wally.

1275
01:10:45.14 --> 01:10:46.14
Really?

1276
01:10:46.14 --> 01:10:47.90
The only thing we heard was from Kavi.

1277
01:10:47.90 --> 01:10:53.54
Kavi said that the team had set up for his rest over night spot too early and he thought

1278
01:10:53.54 --> 01:10:55.14
it was a dangerous spot.

1279
01:10:55.14 --> 01:10:58.14
But the one zero didn't listen to him.

1280
01:10:58.14 --> 01:11:04.06
And so everybody was surprised that he did it because Walt had been a one zero for a few

1281
01:11:04.06 --> 01:11:05.22
months.

1282
01:11:05.22 --> 01:11:11.06
He had been in Marine Corps first, came to SF and then he ran a few missions out of FB1.

1283
01:11:11.06 --> 01:11:18.90
And FB1 shut down, he came down to SF before CCN.

1284
01:11:18.90 --> 01:11:23.74
Would you guys always know who the Kavi was, who the Kavi rider was going to be?

1285
01:11:23.74 --> 01:11:24.74
No.

1286
01:11:24.74 --> 01:11:25.74
No.

1287
01:11:25.74 --> 01:11:30.38
Sometimes it fluctuated, particularly at the we went down at SF before.

1288
01:11:30.38 --> 01:11:35.54
Because the Air Force changed their pilots and all the Kavi riders we had at SF would be

1289
01:11:35.54 --> 01:11:38.06
one, got reassigned somewhere else.

1290
01:11:38.06 --> 01:11:40.42
So none of them carried on as Kavi riders.

1291
01:11:40.42 --> 01:11:44.26
Now Pat Walken's came home, he did roast out.

1292
01:11:44.26 --> 01:11:49.94
Spiderman, CCN, but he had another assignment and I saw a spider very little.

1293
01:11:49.94 --> 01:11:51.70
I couldn't even tell you where it was assignment was.

1294
01:11:51.70 --> 01:11:53.46
He just saw each other so little there.

1295
01:11:53.46 --> 01:11:55.42
Because then I would busy running.

1296
01:11:55.42 --> 01:11:58.46
Would the Kavi rider do all the mission planning with you?

1297
01:11:58.46 --> 01:11:59.46
No.

1298
01:11:59.46 --> 01:12:06.86
The Kavi rider and the pilot would be in for the final briefing at base or at the launch site.

1299
01:12:06.86 --> 01:12:14.38
And it was just talk about LZs, anti aircraft, because they continued to bring down more

1300
01:12:14.38 --> 01:12:15.38
anti aircraft.

1301
01:12:15.38 --> 01:12:24.38
Everything from the 37 mic mics to the heavier anti aircraft artillery came in later.

1302
01:12:24.38 --> 01:12:29.38
Did they ever get the Kavi's ever get shot at and shot down?

1303
01:12:29.38 --> 01:12:30.38
Always.

1304
01:12:30.38 --> 01:12:32.42
We had several went down.

1305
01:12:32.42 --> 01:12:38.10
And there is what altitude would they fly at?

1306
01:12:38.10 --> 01:12:43.78
Well, they would do everything from way up high when they're just doing a general recon.

1307
01:12:43.78 --> 01:12:48.54
To when the team would be on the ground, they would have to spot the team either through smoke

1308
01:12:48.54 --> 01:12:51.22
or mirror or from a location.

1309
01:12:51.22 --> 01:12:53.78
You'd be on a problem point that they could pick us out.

1310
01:12:53.78 --> 01:12:57.66
Well, most of the times would be signal mirror that we flashed she up to them.

1311
01:12:57.66 --> 01:12:59.90
They'd lock in on us that way.

1312
01:12:59.90 --> 01:13:05.26
But once they got to doing actual coverage, they would come down really low and sometimes

1313
01:13:05.26 --> 01:13:06.62
nap and he or his stuff.

1314
01:13:06.62 --> 01:13:11.42
And there would be O2 to slow movers and the little push pool.

1315
01:13:11.42 --> 01:13:13.82
We lost several copies.

1316
01:13:13.82 --> 01:13:18.38
It seems like those, I mean, I can't imagine being the Kavi rider in this one for our

1317
01:13:18.38 --> 01:13:25.10
team, Maryland and you're there and you're basically watching your guys get overrun.

1318
01:13:25.10 --> 01:13:29.66
And I mean, it is that you maybe made suggestions that they move somewhere else.

1319
01:13:29.66 --> 01:13:31.82
But you know, well, they don't, but you're still supporting them.

1320
01:13:31.82 --> 01:13:35.66
I mean, what a helpless feeling that's got to be rough.

1321
01:13:35.66 --> 01:13:41.38
And most of the Kavi riders were guys that could not operate for whatever reason.

1322
01:13:41.38 --> 01:13:43.58
No, they were well, they were former SF.

1323
01:13:43.58 --> 01:13:49.14
So sometimes would be SF men that'd been in country for eight and a nine months.

1324
01:13:49.14 --> 01:13:50.62
And then they'd be assigned to Kavi ride.

1325
01:13:50.62 --> 01:13:52.66
So they had experience on the ground.

1326
01:13:52.66 --> 01:13:53.66
They were short timers.

1327
01:13:53.66 --> 01:14:00.38
So viewed as a job that was not quite as dangerous as being on the ground, but it had

1328
01:14:00.38 --> 01:14:02.58
its own hidden dangers.

1329
01:14:02.58 --> 01:14:03.58
Yeah.

1330
01:14:03.58 --> 01:14:11.02
And it seems like you just want like someone that you really knew and trusted as your

1331
01:14:11.02 --> 01:14:12.02
Kavi rider.

1332
01:14:12.02 --> 01:14:13.02
Right.

1333
01:14:13.02 --> 01:14:14.74
And so like in my case, we had a bunch of new ones.

1334
01:14:14.74 --> 01:14:17.42
So this Kavi rider was great.

1335
01:14:17.42 --> 01:14:20.10
He just picked everybody up, ran as well.

1336
01:14:20.10 --> 01:14:22.26
We had a couple of others that we dealt with.

1337
01:14:22.26 --> 01:14:23.66
And then some of these guys like Spiderman Park.

1338
01:14:23.66 --> 01:14:28.14
So there's a couple of times when there's no air available.

1339
01:14:28.14 --> 01:14:29.98
So you say, how low did they get?

1340
01:14:29.98 --> 01:14:32.38
They would make a gun around with a car 15.

1341
01:14:32.38 --> 01:14:33.70
Spiderman would hang out the window.

1342
01:14:33.70 --> 01:14:35.54
Farron is car 15 at the NVA.

1343
01:14:35.54 --> 01:14:39.58
I don't even know what to say to that.

1344
01:14:39.58 --> 01:14:40.58
Yeah.

1345
01:14:40.58 --> 01:14:42.78
And he wasn't the only Kavi rider did that.

1346
01:14:42.78 --> 01:14:46.78
I mean, other guys have dropped around for an MCD-9.

1347
01:14:46.78 --> 01:14:51.94
That's why they tried to do to give a support while we're waiting for the air force and

1348
01:14:51.94 --> 01:14:53.50
the other air force had to get to.

1349
01:14:53.50 --> 01:14:57.18
You know, I always thought, so when I went to see your school, you know, they taught us

1350
01:14:57.18 --> 01:14:59.86
how to signal with the mirror.

1351
01:14:59.86 --> 01:15:03.74
And in my mind, because I'm dumb, I would think like, I think like, how well does this

1352
01:15:03.74 --> 01:15:05.14
really get to work?

1353
01:15:05.14 --> 01:15:08.74
And I can't believe every, that's like your primary signal device.

1354
01:15:08.74 --> 01:15:09.74
Absolutely.

1355
01:15:09.74 --> 01:15:10.74
Was the signal mirror?

1356
01:15:10.74 --> 01:15:15.50
Yeah, every time that we had been on a ground for a period of time, had to reconnect

1357
01:15:15.50 --> 01:15:18.78
everything was all signal through the mirror.

1358
01:15:18.78 --> 01:15:24.06
And we had to get the flash, you get the Kavi on the right side so he could see us, you know,

1359
01:15:24.06 --> 01:15:25.06
everything, y'all, yeah.

1360
01:15:25.06 --> 01:15:26.70
How big is that mirror?

1361
01:15:26.70 --> 01:15:33.50
That was just a bigger signal mirror, like a, maybe five by three, three by five.

1362
01:15:33.50 --> 01:15:35.18
Like a cell phone.

1363
01:15:35.18 --> 01:15:40.22
Did you have, I had this, even though I didn't really believe in signal mirrors, I guess.

1364
01:15:40.22 --> 01:15:44.94
I had this like special signal mirror that when you pointed it at the thing, it got like

1365
01:15:44.94 --> 01:15:45.94
a little shade.

1366
01:15:45.94 --> 01:15:49.26
There's a little circle in the middle that got a little shade on it when you'd be in the

1367
01:15:49.26 --> 01:15:50.26
right spot.

1368
01:15:50.26 --> 01:15:51.26
You know what I'm talking about?

1369
01:15:51.26 --> 01:15:52.26
Yeah.

1370
01:15:52.26 --> 01:15:53.26
I don't know.

1371
01:15:53.26 --> 01:15:54.26
I never figured out how that quite worked.

1372
01:15:54.26 --> 01:15:56.66
I want to get the flashy up so they could see it.

1373
01:15:56.66 --> 01:16:00.26
Did you like the technique where you're aiming at your hand and pointing at the thing

1374
01:16:00.26 --> 01:16:01.26
at the aircraft?

1375
01:16:01.26 --> 01:16:04.46
No, I was just making sure we had the flashy and just pointed it in general.

1376
01:16:04.46 --> 01:16:06.98
I didn't get that high level training you had.

1377
01:16:06.98 --> 01:16:07.98
You do.

1378
01:16:07.98 --> 01:16:08.98
You do.

1379
01:16:08.98 --> 01:16:11.62
Well, thank God, I didn't ever have to do it.

1380
01:16:11.62 --> 01:16:13.98
Because I probably wouldn't have been able to pull it off.

1381
01:16:13.98 --> 01:16:16.58
Well, triple cannon is a little different than a desert.

1382
01:16:16.58 --> 01:16:17.58
Yeah.

1383
01:16:17.58 --> 01:16:20.90
And so in the triple cannon, that had to be a challenge, too.

1384
01:16:20.90 --> 01:16:23.78
But yeah, you had to find a hole in the jungle to get through with the flashy in

1385
01:16:23.78 --> 01:16:24.78
the first place.

1386
01:16:24.78 --> 01:16:29.82
Then you had to get the cubby lined up with your hole and then with the mirror flash.

1387
01:16:29.82 --> 01:16:34.74
You would look at us nowadays and think we were weak with all the aircraft that we've got.

1388
01:16:34.74 --> 01:16:35.74
We got laser pointers.

1389
01:16:35.74 --> 01:16:39.54
We got little signaling devices, transponders.

1390
01:16:39.54 --> 01:16:40.54
We can't be your equipment.

1391
01:16:40.54 --> 01:16:42.74
There's no question about that.

1392
01:16:42.74 --> 01:16:43.74
Not the messenger.

1393
01:16:43.74 --> 01:16:45.98
We would have run over both of our mothers for the last time.

1394
01:16:45.98 --> 01:16:46.98
Oh, yeah.

1395
01:16:46.98 --> 01:16:47.98
Yeah.

1396
01:16:47.98 --> 01:16:48.98
For sure.

1397
01:16:48.98 --> 01:16:49.98
Oh, yeah.

1398
01:16:49.98 --> 01:16:50.98
And you guys had some starlight scope.

1399
01:16:50.98 --> 01:16:52.50
Do you guys have some starlight thing?

1400
01:16:52.50 --> 01:16:53.50
They're a big and heavy.

1401
01:16:53.50 --> 01:16:54.50
We never carried it.

1402
01:16:54.50 --> 01:16:55.50
They feel.

1403
01:16:55.50 --> 01:16:59.54
No, we only used them for a couple of teams that I couldn't even tell which ones I never

1404
01:16:59.54 --> 01:17:03.90
heard about it much, at least with that will be one or our time at CCN.

1405
01:17:03.90 --> 01:17:06.06
But we used them for ambushes.

1406
01:17:06.06 --> 01:17:07.06
And they were so bright.

1407
01:17:07.06 --> 01:17:08.66
And they ruined your night visits.

1408
01:17:08.66 --> 01:17:15.18
So one eye would be blown out from the green sensors that they used to amplify the light.

1409
01:17:15.18 --> 01:17:18.82
And then your other eye was for night vision.

1410
01:17:18.82 --> 01:17:20.82
Okay.

1411
01:17:20.82 --> 01:17:24.50
Awesome stuff.

1412
01:17:24.50 --> 01:17:32.10
You after this after our team Maryland disappears, going back to the book, the next morning

1413
01:17:32.10 --> 01:17:37.54
Hobbes asked me if I would career a pack of sensitive information to Mac Resog headquarters

1414
01:17:37.54 --> 01:17:41.98
and SIGON, you end up going to SIGON, you end up doing a little bit of Thailand as a time

1415
01:17:41.98 --> 01:17:45.38
in Thailand as well because you had a little pass.

1416
01:17:45.38 --> 01:17:48.98
Sounds like you had a good time there of which you don't remember a lot.

1417
01:17:48.98 --> 01:17:51.98
True.

1418
01:17:51.98 --> 01:17:56.42
You get back to SIGON and you're waiting for a return flight to Denang.

1419
01:17:56.42 --> 01:18:02.30
You'd spend all of your poker money, which remind me never to play poker with you.

1420
01:18:02.30 --> 01:18:03.30
And here we go back to the book.

1421
01:18:03.30 --> 01:18:05.58
For some reason, I couldn't fall asleep that night in SIGON.

1422
01:18:05.58 --> 01:18:09.78
I lay there on my bed looking at the ceiling, watching the ceiling turning, still not believing

1423
01:18:09.78 --> 01:18:13.26
that I'd return to Vietnam and to SIGON.

1424
01:18:13.26 --> 01:18:17.78
At some point I remember thinking when I was in NAMD through my first tour of duty, I dreamed

1425
01:18:17.78 --> 01:18:19.90
of returning to the states.

1426
01:18:19.90 --> 01:18:24.86
When I finally got home, I found myself drawn back to NAMON.

1427
01:18:24.86 --> 01:18:32.42
Of course, there were pressing legal matters at 4-devens that contributed to my leaving

1428
01:18:32.42 --> 01:18:34.18
the US of A.

1429
01:18:34.18 --> 01:18:39.54
As I lay there, I found myself asking myself, what the hell are you doing here?

1430
01:18:39.54 --> 01:18:42.14
You could die.

1431
01:18:42.14 --> 01:18:44.34
It's like realization.

1432
01:18:44.34 --> 01:18:46.86
Yes, that's a medical scene from Apocalypse Down.

1433
01:18:46.86 --> 01:18:47.86
It is.

1434
01:18:47.86 --> 01:18:48.86
It is.

1435
01:18:48.86 --> 01:18:49.86
The Martin Scheme.

1436
01:18:49.86 --> 01:18:50.86
Yeah.

1437
01:18:50.86 --> 01:18:55.30
That mental tape replayed many times in my mind, that night in many different forms.

1438
01:18:55.30 --> 01:19:01.18
But the essence of the issue was when I was in NAMM, I wanted to go home.

1439
01:19:01.18 --> 01:19:05.42
When I was home, I wanted to go to NAMM.

1440
01:19:05.42 --> 01:19:09.94
Once again, I thought of home where other than my family, there was no compelling reason

1441
01:19:09.94 --> 01:19:10.94
to return.

1442
01:19:10.94 --> 01:19:11.94
I had no job waiting.

1443
01:19:11.94 --> 01:19:14.22
I had no career to speak of.

1444
01:19:14.22 --> 01:19:19.54
I imagined going to one of those county employment centers and saying, hi, I was a

1445
01:19:19.54 --> 01:19:21.94
one zero in a secret war that I can't talk about.

1446
01:19:21.94 --> 01:19:27.06
I can fire my car 15 from the hip real good and I can hit a target at 400 meters with

1447
01:19:27.06 --> 01:19:35.74
my salt off M79 and I could bring Napom so close that it will suck the air out of your lungs.

1448
01:19:35.74 --> 01:19:41.62
Thus at the age of 23, I had my midlife crisis.

1449
01:19:41.62 --> 01:19:52.14
There's a picture that one of my platoon chiefs told me about he had this mentor, Vietnam

1450
01:19:52.14 --> 01:19:58.02
seal, who was a male man in Imperial Beach, California.

1451
01:19:58.02 --> 01:20:02.66
He came home from Vietnam and became a male man.

1452
01:20:02.66 --> 01:20:10.90
My platoon chief said that that guy had a picture on his wall and it was taken from the

1453
01:20:10.90 --> 01:20:17.98
behind of a guy in fatigue with his web gear on and his weapon's slung and he's looking

1454
01:20:17.98 --> 01:20:21.02
at a corporate guy in a desk.

1455
01:20:21.02 --> 01:20:24.90
The corporate guy is looking up at him and the caption underneath it says, I'm sorry sir,

1456
01:20:24.90 --> 01:20:27.50
we don't have a job here for appointment.

1457
01:20:27.50 --> 01:20:30.22
He just sounds like how you are feeling.

1458
01:20:30.22 --> 01:20:31.22
It's perfect.

1459
01:20:31.22 --> 01:20:32.22
On point.

1460
01:20:32.22 --> 01:20:34.22
Yeah.

1461
01:20:34.22 --> 01:20:39.30
And you got this and this is interesting.

1462
01:20:39.30 --> 01:20:46.22
I was just talking to one of my buddies and he was saying, look, sometimes I hear people

1463
01:20:46.22 --> 01:20:52.26
say, I loved being in combat and when they say that I kind of get pissed at him.

1464
01:20:52.26 --> 01:20:57.50
I think if you loved it so much, he says, I don't love it so much.

1465
01:20:57.50 --> 01:20:58.86
I had a hard time with it.

1466
01:20:58.86 --> 01:21:00.50
It was hard.

1467
01:21:00.50 --> 01:21:04.10
I would do it again if I had to but I'm not dreaming about it.

1468
01:21:04.10 --> 01:21:05.34
We had this little conversation.

1469
01:21:05.34 --> 01:21:12.10
What I ended up saying to him was, I said, well, when I was on my last appointment to Iraq,

1470
01:21:12.10 --> 01:21:22.02
then we had one guy killed at this point and there starts to be like, you start seeing

1471
01:21:22.02 --> 01:21:26.18
those negative feelings start to grow a little bit.

1472
01:21:26.18 --> 01:21:28.30
Guy started questioning stuff.

1473
01:21:28.30 --> 01:21:30.94
Guy started, hey, what are we doing this?

1474
01:21:30.94 --> 01:21:34.42
I'll pray, who's why are we doing this mission?

1475
01:21:34.42 --> 01:21:36.38
You start to feel that.

1476
01:21:36.38 --> 01:21:39.98
Then guys start to become negative.

1477
01:21:39.98 --> 01:21:45.10
Then one of my two commanders came to me and said, hey, man, this is going to be rough.

1478
01:21:45.10 --> 01:21:46.10
We get home.

1479
01:21:46.10 --> 01:21:51.50
These guys are going to be mad about that.

1480
01:21:51.50 --> 01:21:52.54
They're going to be mad about something else.

1481
01:21:52.54 --> 01:21:55.58
I said, let me tell you what's going to happen.

1482
01:21:55.58 --> 01:22:01.26
I said, when we get home, when you talk to them three days after we get home, they will

1483
01:22:01.26 --> 01:22:05.30
have forgotten 10% of the bad stuff.

1484
01:22:05.30 --> 01:22:10.26
In a week, they'll forget 30% and in a month, they'll forget 50%.

1485
01:22:10.26 --> 01:22:13.94
I said in a year, the only thing they'll remember about this deployment is the fun cool

1486
01:22:13.94 --> 01:22:15.94
stuff.

1487
01:22:15.94 --> 01:22:22.90
That's kind of what I think makes guys like me say, man, I would love to go back.

1488
01:22:22.90 --> 01:22:27.54
Of course, because we block out some of the hard memories.

1489
01:22:27.54 --> 01:22:32.42
For me, I also always say the absolute best time of my life was being a task and a commander

1490
01:22:32.42 --> 01:22:37.38
in the battle of Ramani and the worst time of my life was being a task and a commander in

1491
01:22:37.38 --> 01:22:42.14
the battle of Ramani because there's nothing worse than losing your guys.

1492
01:22:42.14 --> 01:22:49.06
It sounds like that was hitting you mid-deployment of, hey, look, when you were home

1493
01:22:49.06 --> 01:22:55.06
when you're back in America, you got money problems, you got girl problems, you got

1494
01:22:55.06 --> 01:23:00.22
law problems, you got all those problems and they can all go away.

1495
01:23:00.22 --> 01:23:06.02
And all become insignificant as you get on that C130 in flyback overseas.

1496
01:23:06.02 --> 01:23:10.38
And I thought about Hep-Sau, home, to one in the team.

1497
01:23:10.38 --> 01:23:16.06
I genuinely had that guilt feeling of them there and me not being there with them.

1498
01:23:16.06 --> 01:23:21.42
I felt as a greenbrake, I should have been there with them all along.

1499
01:23:21.42 --> 01:23:25.14
But we had a tour duty as you know.

1500
01:23:25.14 --> 01:23:28.50
So I was in a way, I was really glad to be back on the team.

1501
01:23:28.50 --> 01:23:32.14
But yes, a little bit more mature now and thinking a little bit maybe too much.

1502
01:23:32.14 --> 01:23:37.14
But that night in that hotel and then 20 years later when a apocalypse now comes out, I go like,

1503
01:23:37.14 --> 01:23:40.98
how to help they get in my head for that scene?

1504
01:23:40.98 --> 01:23:49.22
You obviously you get through that apocalypse now, see.

1505
01:23:49.22 --> 01:23:53.26
Of staring at the ceiling and thinking, you know, every minute that I'm in the bush, every

1506
01:23:53.26 --> 01:23:58.18
minute I'm in the so-called Charlie Good Stronger because he's out in the bush.

1507
01:23:58.18 --> 01:24:03.82
You get back and you're all another mission and I'm jumping into it right now.

1508
01:24:03.82 --> 01:24:05.94
As I snapped out of my snooze, you're asleep and I look up at us.

1509
01:24:05.94 --> 01:24:10.50
As I snapped out of my snooze, I looked it out the starboard door just as we flew over

1510
01:24:10.50 --> 01:24:16.38
the two star-to-lay ocean farmers, a woman and two water buffalo.

1511
01:24:16.38 --> 01:24:21.10
The big chopper then hopped over the hedge row and landed in an adjacent field as angles

1512
01:24:21.10 --> 01:24:25.06
and I frantically awakened the rest of RT Idaho.

1513
01:24:25.06 --> 01:24:26.50
I was mad as hell.

1514
01:24:26.50 --> 01:24:30.74
It wasn't bad enough they hadn't bothered to alert us as we approached the target area,

1515
01:24:30.74 --> 01:24:35.86
but now they were compounding that faux paw by flying too close to indigenous farmers

1516
01:24:35.86 --> 01:24:42.02
and then depositing us in the middle of an open field far from our primary LZ and farther

1517
01:24:42.02 --> 01:24:47.02
yet from the bridge that was the primary objective of our mission.

1518
01:24:47.02 --> 01:24:52.10
That this particular mission was a pretty simple one at least on paper, which I take

1519
01:24:52.10 --> 01:24:55.50
it with a serious grain of salt when you say a mission is a pretty simple one.

1520
01:24:55.50 --> 01:24:57.18
Yeah.

1521
01:24:57.18 --> 01:25:02.86
By early 1970, the brass had become aware of something new and rather creative on the part

1522
01:25:02.86 --> 01:25:05.62
of the NVA underwater bridges.

1523
01:25:05.62 --> 01:25:10.66
These were being put in place at strategic spots along the Ho Chi Min Trail where it ran

1524
01:25:10.66 --> 01:25:12.94
through louss.

1525
01:25:12.94 --> 01:25:17.06
From the air it would appear as though the trails were interrupted by water in some places

1526
01:25:17.06 --> 01:25:21.36
several feet deep, yet it was apparent that the trucks heading south were crossing these

1527
01:25:21.36 --> 01:25:27.44
streams with ease, a closer review of aerial photographs, however, had revealed that the

1528
01:25:27.44 --> 01:25:33.08
ever-inventive NVA had come up with an underwater structure that could support heavy trucking

1529
01:25:33.08 --> 01:25:37.12
while remaining virtually unabsorbable from the air.

1530
01:25:37.12 --> 01:25:40.96
It was a devishly clever idea and well executed to boot.

1531
01:25:40.96 --> 01:25:42.32
That's pretty.

1532
01:25:42.32 --> 01:25:45.88
They just built these like maybe like six inches underwater, the bridge?

1533
01:25:45.88 --> 01:25:46.88
Yeah.

1534
01:25:46.88 --> 01:25:49.60
And we, and look at the pictures you could tell.

1535
01:25:49.60 --> 01:25:52.52
They had really done it well.

1536
01:25:52.52 --> 01:25:53.52
So that was the mission.

1537
01:25:53.52 --> 01:25:55.68
It's simple going to find out what they are.

1538
01:25:55.68 --> 01:25:58.84
Take pictures and blow them to hell up.

1539
01:25:58.84 --> 01:25:59.84
Simple mission.

1540
01:25:59.84 --> 01:26:00.84
Yeah.

1541
01:26:00.84 --> 01:26:04.12
If it'd be more fun to blow them up with the truck on it.

1542
01:26:04.12 --> 01:26:08.24
And you were, you guys were sleeping the helicopters heading there, known woke you up.

1543
01:26:08.24 --> 01:26:13.24
And the reason why we lost from Thailand, the weather had been soaked in a Vietnam.

1544
01:26:13.24 --> 01:26:19.88
So it was a bad weather spell which was February 1970 and they flew us by Blackbirds,

1545
01:26:19.88 --> 01:26:25.08
which were the plant-destined service airlin' it for us.

1546
01:26:25.08 --> 01:26:26.56
Fuse the Thailand.

1547
01:26:26.56 --> 01:26:31.76
We land in Thailand which is neutral at the Air Force Base and the Black truck comes up.

1548
01:26:31.76 --> 01:26:35.80
We get in, has curtains, they can't see us, we go back to the base.

1549
01:26:35.80 --> 01:26:42.04
And I'll command her from FB1 was the CO that launch site, which was the 46 Special Forces

1550
01:26:42.04 --> 01:26:43.48
Group.

1551
01:26:43.48 --> 01:26:47.64
And they were there just to be in country but they had their side to the Seek of War.

1552
01:26:47.64 --> 01:26:50.88
Spads that came out of there, they had cubbies out of there.

1553
01:26:50.88 --> 01:26:56.56
And so we launched, and the Air Force had the HHH3s, the bigger helicopters, like the

1554
01:26:56.56 --> 01:27:00.56
Jolligme giant, but a scaled down version without the armor plating.

1555
01:27:00.56 --> 01:27:05.14
So we launched from there and we flew for two or three hours because the long flight from

1556
01:27:05.14 --> 01:27:08.56
Thailand across Western Leos.

1557
01:27:08.56 --> 01:27:14.48
And then we launched, we landed at a fuel dump in the middle of the Lals.

1558
01:27:14.48 --> 01:27:16.60
Yeah, it was run by the agency.

1559
01:27:16.60 --> 01:27:17.60
Oh, okay.

1560
01:27:17.60 --> 01:27:18.60
So we land.

1561
01:27:18.60 --> 01:27:19.60
So we refueled.

1562
01:27:19.60 --> 01:27:22.72
Yes, we refueled but you get off, you go like, hey man, who are you?

1563
01:27:22.72 --> 01:27:23.72
I'm not here.

1564
01:27:23.72 --> 01:27:25.72
I go, I'm not here either.

1565
01:27:25.72 --> 01:27:28.92
He says, have a good day while you're not here.

1566
01:27:28.92 --> 01:27:32.80
And we continue to go in and then the Air Force put us down on that canyon.

1567
01:27:32.80 --> 01:27:36.32
And that's one thing that's always interesting when you're using helicopters.

1568
01:27:36.32 --> 01:27:42.92
The helicopter, when you're supposed to insert at one spot, for them, they miss that spot

1569
01:27:42.92 --> 01:27:45.08
by a minute or whatever.

1570
01:27:45.08 --> 01:27:46.08
For them, it's no big deal.

1571
01:27:46.08 --> 01:27:49.56
Like, hey, they just flew a minute a little bit long for you on the ground.

1572
01:27:49.56 --> 01:27:51.56
That minute is a long time.

1573
01:27:51.56 --> 01:27:53.04
I mean, that can be a kilometer.

1574
01:27:53.04 --> 01:27:56.36
It could be like a really massive amount of space that you just missed.

1575
01:27:56.36 --> 01:27:57.36
Oh, yeah.

1576
01:27:57.36 --> 01:28:01.68
And this is like the dip between the valley and the peak that we wanted to go in on.

1577
01:28:01.68 --> 01:28:05.52
So we could run at night a little bit because there's some open areas that we could cover

1578
01:28:05.52 --> 01:28:09.000
and then get down maybe at the middle of the night to check this thing out in the morning

1579
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.000
and first light, that's where our plan was.

1580
01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.84
Just didn't have a window valley.

1581
01:28:13.84 --> 01:28:16.48
And it's like, okay, we're flowing out here.

1582
01:28:16.48 --> 01:28:18.28
I certainly don't want to just fly back.

1583
01:28:18.28 --> 01:28:19.84
This is everybody off.

1584
01:28:19.84 --> 01:28:20.84
Let's give the shot.

1585
01:28:20.84 --> 01:28:21.84
We're here.

1586
01:28:21.84 --> 01:28:22.84
We're on the ground to scow.

1587
01:28:22.84 --> 01:28:24.08
So we had to get out of what our gear on first.

1588
01:28:24.08 --> 01:28:28.000
We didn't even have our routine and the dirt where everybody goes out on full alert.

1589
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.04
We get out and put the dam equipment on.

1590
01:28:31.04 --> 01:28:34.84
And then we're like, okay, we're in the valley and the mountain we want to be on

1591
01:28:34.84 --> 01:28:39.08
because several thousand feet above us and we're in this valley.

1592
01:28:39.08 --> 01:28:42.08
Are you carrying a regular topographic map?

1593
01:28:42.08 --> 01:28:44.76
Is that your primary means of navigation?

1594
01:28:44.76 --> 01:28:45.76
Yes.

1595
01:28:45.76 --> 01:28:50.08
And they would have a big map and then our target where we would plan to go, they would

1596
01:28:50.08 --> 01:28:52.92
cut out 10 by 10, cut it out.

1597
01:28:52.92 --> 01:28:54.76
And that's also all we carried.

1598
01:28:54.76 --> 01:28:59.40
So if we got caught, there would be nothing else besides just that grid that we were in.

1599
01:28:59.40 --> 01:29:04.76
And did you ever use any imagery as well to complement that?

1600
01:29:04.76 --> 01:29:11.08
Most strictly map the cubby pile, if they did it VR, visual reconnaissance prior to the mission.

1601
01:29:11.08 --> 01:29:13.28
But here it wasn't.

1602
01:29:13.28 --> 01:29:16.20
The cubby had told them, here's the target area.

1603
01:29:16.20 --> 01:29:20.68
And for some reason, the airfewish just went down to the valley and dropped us there.

1604
01:29:20.68 --> 01:29:28.80
All right, continuing on, given the rather undistinguished nature of our arrival, or

1605
01:29:28.80 --> 01:29:32.32
sorry, undisguised nature of our arrival, we knew it was only a matter of time before

1606
01:29:32.32 --> 01:29:37.08
hundreds of NVA troops, trackers and dogs who would be perring down on us on that road looking

1607
01:29:37.08 --> 01:29:38.08
for us.

1608
01:29:38.08 --> 01:29:44.56
So we get to work with dogs.

1609
01:29:44.56 --> 01:29:48.92
So like I can't imagine knowing going in that I'm going to be facing dogs that are

1610
01:29:48.92 --> 01:29:50.04
going to come in after us.

1611
01:29:50.04 --> 01:29:52.76
And obviously you guys work as you guys carried mace and pepper and all this other stuff

1612
01:29:52.76 --> 01:29:53.76
to throw them off.

1613
01:29:53.76 --> 01:29:55.60
But what a nightmare that is.

1614
01:29:55.60 --> 01:29:57.64
I still hate dogs.

1615
01:29:57.64 --> 01:29:58.64
Yeah.

1616
01:29:58.64 --> 01:30:00.64
My wife loves them, but in the kids love them.

1617
01:30:00.64 --> 01:30:01.64
Do you have any dogs?

1618
01:30:01.64 --> 01:30:03.64
Yeah, we got a flee bag running around.

1619
01:30:03.64 --> 01:30:09.64
I just named his gunny buttocks.

1620
01:30:09.64 --> 01:30:11.64
We got him from a gunny.

1621
01:30:11.64 --> 01:30:14.64
So okay.

1622
01:30:14.64 --> 01:30:16.24
Arz was no tourist giant.

1623
01:30:16.24 --> 01:30:20.20
Furthermore, it's very unsettling to be moving through this beautiful valley and broad daylight

1624
01:30:20.20 --> 01:30:23.80
at what for a recon team passed at breakneck speed.

1625
01:30:23.80 --> 01:30:25.56
It was not comfortable way to proceed.

1626
01:30:25.56 --> 01:30:29.84
We took no breaks and I wanted to spend a moment longer than necessary in such an exposed

1627
01:30:29.84 --> 01:30:30.84
position.

1628
01:30:30.84 --> 01:30:31.84
I was calling us.

1629
01:30:31.84 --> 01:30:34.32
Oh yeah, trying to get out of this valley.

1630
01:30:34.32 --> 01:30:36.24
His fastest as you can.

1631
01:30:36.24 --> 01:30:40.68
And you end up going up a hill, a big hill.

1632
01:30:40.68 --> 01:30:42.68
And we just put the team to for a while.

1633
01:30:42.68 --> 01:30:45.28
I put the angles on one side to valley and me on the other.

1634
01:30:45.28 --> 01:30:49.96
Wasn't that big in terms of width but wide enough that I could see him.

1635
01:30:49.96 --> 01:30:51.28
He could see me.

1636
01:30:51.28 --> 01:30:55.52
Just a one divide and the tail gunners took care of our foot footprints.

1637
01:30:55.52 --> 01:30:59.64
And what was your reason for that call?

1638
01:30:59.64 --> 01:31:03.000
I just wanted to split the team up to see what was on the other side of valley.

1639
01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
We couldn't tell either side what was there.

1640
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.28
So I figured we could just any enemy.

1641
01:31:07.28 --> 01:31:11.36
We wanted to find out on both sides at once and try to get to a point where we could

1642
01:31:11.36 --> 01:31:14.76
begin to find a spot to get up the mountain.

1643
01:31:14.76 --> 01:31:16.28
Could we were going to run out of daylight?

1644
01:31:16.28 --> 01:31:17.28
Got it.

1645
01:31:17.28 --> 01:31:20.08
So it was a little bit of a panic.

1646
01:31:20.08 --> 01:31:21.08
Now panic.

1647
01:31:21.08 --> 01:31:22.08
It was a hit.

1648
01:31:22.08 --> 01:31:23.08
We're in a tough situation.

1649
01:31:23.08 --> 01:31:25.60
One of the best ways we can get out of this is we put teams on both sides of valley.

1650
01:31:25.60 --> 01:31:28.08
We're looking for a way to get to the top of this thing.

1651
01:31:28.08 --> 01:31:31.40
I knew you talked about this earlier and I used to warn guys all the time about splitting

1652
01:31:31.40 --> 01:31:32.40
forces.

1653
01:31:32.40 --> 01:31:33.40
Oh yeah.

1654
01:31:33.40 --> 01:31:34.76
And it's like really risky.

1655
01:31:34.76 --> 01:31:35.76
Really really risky.

1656
01:31:35.76 --> 01:31:37.40
It's a one rule you never do.

1657
01:31:37.40 --> 01:31:38.60
I did it twice.

1658
01:31:38.60 --> 01:31:39.60
Okay.

1659
01:31:39.60 --> 01:31:41.12
So I just wanted to confirm that.

1660
01:31:41.12 --> 01:31:42.12
Oh yeah, no.

1661
01:31:42.12 --> 01:31:43.12
Absolutely.

1662
01:31:43.12 --> 01:31:47.08
And the situation was such that we couldn't tell what was on either side.

1663
01:31:47.08 --> 01:31:49.52
So I figured we're going to have a firefight.

1664
01:31:49.52 --> 01:31:52.44
At least now there'll be minimal forces.

1665
01:31:52.44 --> 01:31:55.12
Our four we went in and ate mantim at times.

1666
01:31:55.12 --> 01:31:56.32
That's four and four.

1667
01:31:56.32 --> 01:31:59.44
And John had been on the ground with me previously.

1668
01:31:59.44 --> 01:32:02.24
So he wasn't worried about John.

1669
01:32:02.24 --> 01:32:03.72
And so we're going to have a firefight.

1670
01:32:03.72 --> 01:32:05.24
Let's do with minimal forces.

1671
01:32:05.24 --> 01:32:08.68
We can survive and then get the parry fired and we're about getting out of here.

1672
01:32:08.68 --> 01:32:13.12
Otherwise it's proceed and the car was much ground because that mission where we set

1673
01:32:13.12 --> 01:32:14.60
up the ambush.

1674
01:32:14.60 --> 01:32:17.68
We had a great success by not stopping.

1675
01:32:17.68 --> 01:32:20.52
Because the NVA knew that we would go 10 and stop 10.

1676
01:32:20.52 --> 01:32:22.92
So they would anticipate how far we traveled here.

1677
01:32:22.92 --> 01:32:25.76
It's like we covered maximum ground.

1678
01:32:25.76 --> 01:32:26.76
We're going to go in and out.

1679
01:32:26.76 --> 01:32:27.76
Yeah.

1680
01:32:27.76 --> 01:32:28.76
All right.

1681
01:32:28.76 --> 01:32:32.52
Now you end up finding a place to go up this hill.

1682
01:32:32.52 --> 01:32:33.52
And here we go back to the book.

1683
01:32:33.52 --> 01:32:35.000
By now we are out of breath.

1684
01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.32
The grueling climb with all our convicts here was started to wear on us.

1685
01:32:38.32 --> 01:32:43.36
And each additional step seemed to bring an increase in the steepness of the incline.

1686
01:32:43.36 --> 01:32:48.40
It was growing painfully clear that those periodic volleyball games we had played back

1687
01:32:48.40 --> 01:32:53.40
at camp weren't sufficient physical training.

1688
01:32:53.40 --> 01:32:55.44
What did you guys do for PT back then?

1689
01:32:55.44 --> 01:32:56.44
Not enough.

1690
01:32:56.44 --> 01:32:57.44
Volleyball.

1691
01:32:57.44 --> 01:32:58.44
Get some.

1692
01:32:58.44 --> 01:33:02.44
Yeah, that was it.

1693
01:33:02.44 --> 01:33:03.44
Yeah.

1694
01:33:03.44 --> 01:33:04.44
We're so busy.

1695
01:33:04.44 --> 01:33:06.000
Between the mission and mission prep.

1696
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.44
And then they started to stickness in isolation.

1697
01:33:07.44 --> 01:33:08.44
That's going to ask you.

1698
01:33:08.44 --> 01:33:12.68
Would you be tired when you're going into the field or would you be well rested?

1699
01:33:12.68 --> 01:33:14.12
Because on this one you fell asleep.

1700
01:33:14.12 --> 01:33:15.12
You guys were all asleep.

1701
01:33:15.12 --> 01:33:16.12
Oh yeah.

1702
01:33:16.12 --> 01:33:17.96
I'm going to tell you right now like when we were going to field most of the time when I

1703
01:33:17.96 --> 01:33:20.76
would go in the field, especially in Ramadi, I would be exhausted by the time I went

1704
01:33:20.76 --> 01:33:21.76
the field.

1705
01:33:21.76 --> 01:33:24.36
Because we spent all this time planning and decomposing and briefing and doing all this stuff

1706
01:33:24.36 --> 01:33:25.36
at the time I went into the field.

1707
01:33:25.36 --> 01:33:28.84
It was like the time for me to go, okay, hey, someone, someone's staying watch, I'm going

1708
01:33:28.84 --> 01:33:30.48
to sleep for an hour or two hours.

1709
01:33:30.48 --> 01:33:32.000
You know, that happened a lot.

1710
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.52
Yeah, we used to get a nice rest prior.

1711
01:33:33.52 --> 01:33:34.52
Yeah, that's nice.

1712
01:33:34.52 --> 01:33:35.52
Oh yeah, absolutely.

1713
01:33:35.52 --> 01:33:36.76
Yeah, it's a luxury.

1714
01:33:36.76 --> 01:33:39.88
Very nice.

1715
01:33:39.88 --> 01:33:44.88
Going back to the book, however, any thoughts of letting personal pain slow us down were not

1716
01:33:44.88 --> 01:33:49.32
so subtly overwritten by noises we could hear from the north of us.

1717
01:33:49.32 --> 01:33:53.80
The menacing sounds made us forget our dry throats, keeping lungs, pain needs and knees

1718
01:33:53.80 --> 01:33:55.04
and aching backs.

1719
01:33:55.04 --> 01:33:59.40
The enemy was out there and the game as they say was on.

1720
01:33:59.40 --> 01:34:02.44
The forces might not yet be joined, but the fight was in the office.

1721
01:34:02.44 --> 01:34:05.04
So you knew it was coming.

1722
01:34:05.04 --> 01:34:06.84
And then you guys go into like a series.

1723
01:34:06.84 --> 01:34:14.88
The sow leads you guys into like a serious thinking of vine thorns undergrowth.

1724
01:34:14.88 --> 01:34:18.68
We went in and then we went in deeper and then he pushed us to third time.

1725
01:34:18.68 --> 01:34:20.84
I was pissed because tore my fatigues.

1726
01:34:20.84 --> 01:34:25.48
I'm going to sell, you know, dinky, dalle, like you're crazy.

1727
01:34:25.48 --> 01:34:26.76
You're pushed it.

1728
01:34:26.76 --> 01:34:27.76
He was right.

1729
01:34:27.76 --> 01:34:28.76
I was wrong.

1730
01:34:28.76 --> 01:34:30.92
I mean, went in the third level.

1731
01:34:30.92 --> 01:34:31.92
Yeah.

1732
01:34:31.92 --> 01:34:36.40
And then you get in so deep eventually settled down and tried to get us comfortable

1733
01:34:36.40 --> 01:34:39.48
possible on a 40 degree slope.

1734
01:34:39.48 --> 01:34:44.36
Around 2,200 we heard numerous trucks on the main road in just a few minutes.

1735
01:34:44.36 --> 01:34:48.88
Several had driven slowly past our remain overnight position.

1736
01:34:48.88 --> 01:34:54.36
Unfortunately, the happy times were spoiled when we soon heard the barking of tracking

1737
01:34:54.36 --> 01:34:58.04
dogs around 0100.

1738
01:34:58.04 --> 01:35:01.80
We heard the enemy troops move north on the road while on the east side someone opened

1739
01:35:01.80 --> 01:35:04.52
fire with a few AK47 bursts.

1740
01:35:04.52 --> 01:35:09.16
The distinctive bark of the Russian-made weapon jar dust into full alert.

1741
01:35:09.16 --> 01:35:13.000
How long could they keep it up in which direction would they move?

1742
01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.16
We sat in the inky darkness.

1743
01:35:15.16 --> 01:35:19.64
A darkness so complete I couldn't see my hand in front of my face.

1744
01:35:19.64 --> 01:35:22.84
It sounded as though they were making their way north.

1745
01:35:22.84 --> 01:35:24.88
That's how dark it is.

1746
01:35:24.88 --> 01:35:26.04
And you have no night vision.

1747
01:35:26.04 --> 01:35:28.56
It's just pitch black.

1748
01:35:28.56 --> 01:35:33.56
Again.

1749
01:35:33.56 --> 01:35:38.44
It didn't take long before we had enemy troops on both sides of us.

1750
01:35:38.44 --> 01:35:44.44
As dense as our cover was, we could see the flickering light from the lamps the NVA carried.

1751
01:35:44.44 --> 01:35:48.60
As the enemy soldiers began probing the bottom tip of the finger we were on, the

1752
01:35:48.60 --> 01:35:51.64
Eccal activity on the road picked up noticeably.

1753
01:35:51.64 --> 01:35:53.76
This gave us a very uneasy feeling.

1754
01:35:53.76 --> 01:35:57.52
Had sound not driven us on the NVA might well have spotted us.

1755
01:35:57.52 --> 01:36:03.96
But as it was, we were as cons to so deep in that got awful thick that the one enemy

1756
01:36:03.96 --> 01:36:09.32
soldier who approached our position hesitated and then gave up defeated by the phony

1757
01:36:09.32 --> 01:36:11.16
vegetation.

1758
01:36:11.16 --> 01:36:15.80
We could almost feel him thinking better of it and deciding to return to his comrades

1759
01:36:15.80 --> 01:36:22.96
little did he appreciate how close to death he'd come with five car 15s and an M79 aimed

1760
01:36:22.96 --> 01:36:24.92
in his direction.

1761
01:36:24.92 --> 01:36:29.32
Slowed the NVA troops tired of their frustrating and uncomfortable search and called

1762
01:36:29.32 --> 01:36:30.88
it off.

1763
01:36:30.88 --> 01:36:34.84
Our TI to ho could finally release the collective breath and it had been holding.

1764
01:36:34.84 --> 01:36:36.32
The danger was not gone.

1765
01:36:36.32 --> 01:36:42.52
Now by a long shot but just briefly retired from the field of play.

1766
01:36:42.52 --> 01:36:45.08
So thank God you were deep in that bush.

1767
01:36:45.08 --> 01:36:46.08
Oh yeah.

1768
01:36:46.08 --> 01:36:49.08
I don't know, I forgave myself.

1769
01:36:49.08 --> 01:36:52.52
I was like this is, we don't need to go that far.

1770
01:36:52.52 --> 01:36:55.80
It's like look at my fatis, I'm bleeding here.

1771
01:36:55.80 --> 01:36:57.12
He's right.

1772
01:36:57.12 --> 01:36:58.52
Sal was always right.

1773
01:36:58.52 --> 01:37:00.84
Always listen to him.

1774
01:37:00.84 --> 01:37:06.28
So the night goes by at first light, our options were severely limited.

1775
01:37:06.28 --> 01:37:09.08
We couldn't move north south or east.

1776
01:37:09.08 --> 01:37:12.96
Which left us one choice, not wanting to spend another day and night tied to trees on the

1777
01:37:12.96 --> 01:37:14.16
side of a hill.

1778
01:37:14.16 --> 01:37:17.64
We opted for the obvious and moved out in a western lead direction.

1779
01:37:17.64 --> 01:37:20.68
For the rest of the day we climbed the side of the steep mountain.

1780
01:37:20.68 --> 01:37:23.36
Did you guys ever move at night?

1781
01:37:23.36 --> 01:37:28.48
Or did you guys try pretty much to remain in one position at night?

1782
01:37:28.48 --> 01:37:29.48
Try to stay in one position.

1783
01:37:29.48 --> 01:37:34.12
Particularly in the triple canopy because just too much noise.

1784
01:37:34.12 --> 01:37:37.44
In Cambodia, when we were on flat territory, we could have moved.

1785
01:37:37.44 --> 01:37:39.12
We thought about it.

1786
01:37:39.12 --> 01:37:44.20
But no, not in lousy.

1787
01:37:44.20 --> 01:37:48.20
Several times the rock face was so steep, we had to tie together six foot strands of rope

1788
01:37:48.20 --> 01:37:52.68
we used for Swiss seats to make rope long enough to advance up to the next level of rocks.

1789
01:37:52.68 --> 01:37:54.48
So we're talking serious terrain.

1790
01:37:54.48 --> 01:37:57.12
Oh, horrible.

1791
01:37:57.12 --> 01:38:00.40
This is last light was fading in a darkness we reached the top of the mountain.

1792
01:38:00.40 --> 01:38:01.56
I was physically beat.

1793
01:38:01.56 --> 01:38:05.44
My pants were torn in my hands, knees and legs were covered with cuts, scrapes and bruises.

1794
01:38:05.44 --> 01:38:06.76
We were a mess.

1795
01:38:06.76 --> 01:38:11.56
We set up our our our awan quickly in turn, to eat in rascans before settling into the

1796
01:38:11.56 --> 01:38:13.16
night, watch rotations.

1797
01:38:13.16 --> 01:38:18.72
After the previous night, nights our awan, this mountain type, mountain top site was paradise.

1798
01:38:18.72 --> 01:38:22.64
We could see enemy trucks moving south but did nothing about it.

1799
01:38:22.64 --> 01:38:27.20
We were almost too tired to think and extremely dangerous condition to be in went on the

1800
01:38:27.20 --> 01:38:28.20
ground.

1801
01:38:28.20 --> 01:38:33.08
Rast was what we needed, not confrontation.

1802
01:38:33.08 --> 01:38:34.08
Yes, it exhausted.

1803
01:38:34.08 --> 01:38:35.08
Beat.

1804
01:38:35.08 --> 01:38:44.72
When we climbed to take a web gear off, rock sacks, we timed all the Swiss seats together

1805
01:38:44.72 --> 01:38:46.16
because we're going straight up.

1806
01:38:46.16 --> 01:38:52.56
So we want to go up and then you shipped up the backpack, then the web gear, put it back

1807
01:38:52.56 --> 01:38:54.56
on, go through the next level.

1808
01:38:54.56 --> 01:38:59.76
We had to take that, just shut it several times and just to get up because it was so steep

1809
01:38:59.76 --> 01:39:04.40
but it was covered with enough vegetation that they couldn't see us in the valley.

1810
01:39:04.40 --> 01:39:08.40
So they weren't quite sure where we were and we had put out the mace and stuff.

1811
01:39:08.40 --> 01:39:11.68
Another location is which found some of the dogs' noses.

1812
01:39:11.68 --> 01:39:17.76
So it was an all day climb and we only a couple, when we broke for lunch and whatever but

1813
01:39:17.76 --> 01:39:21.68
that was a nasty, nasty climb.

1814
01:39:21.68 --> 01:39:26.80
And morning came we awoke to a beautiful sunrise and found that we were top an unbelievably

1815
01:39:26.80 --> 01:39:29.76
gorgeous, lay-ocean mountain range.

1816
01:39:29.76 --> 01:39:33.40
The next few hours were the most spectacular ones I ever had spent on the ground in any

1817
01:39:33.40 --> 01:39:34.20
A.O.

1818
01:39:34.20 --> 01:39:39.08
Moving north along the ridge line, we began gradually descending, often encouraging one

1819
01:39:39.08 --> 01:39:44.72
beautiful new encountering one beautiful new vista after another.

1820
01:39:44.72 --> 01:39:51.92
On 12, 100, we found an area overrun with thousands of wild orchids in full spectacular

1821
01:39:51.92 --> 01:39:52.92
bloom.

1822
01:39:52.92 --> 01:39:57.24
Back home, each plant would be worth five to fifty dollars.

1823
01:39:57.24 --> 01:40:02.04
We decided to take a break in the field and soon everyone with the exception of sal was

1824
01:40:02.04 --> 01:40:06.24
in the middle of them and acting like a delighted child, picking the flowers and sticking

1825
01:40:06.24 --> 01:40:11.24
them in their hair, teeth and behind their ears, and the buttonholes of their fatigues.

1826
01:40:11.24 --> 01:40:14.36
It was like a spontaneous outburst of happiness.

1827
01:40:14.36 --> 01:40:17.32
And while it was somewhat foolish, it was also refreshing.

1828
01:40:17.32 --> 01:40:20.28
I think we all felt better for it.

1829
01:40:20.28 --> 01:40:22.28
Did you take any pictures?

1830
01:40:22.28 --> 01:40:23.28
No.

1831
01:40:23.28 --> 01:40:25.28
Oh man, I might have seen those.

1832
01:40:25.28 --> 01:40:26.28
Yeah, yeah.

1833
01:40:26.28 --> 01:40:30.28
You had the camera for the underwater bridge, you didn't get the orchids.

1834
01:40:30.28 --> 01:40:31.52
But sal was all business.

1835
01:40:31.52 --> 01:40:32.52
Oh always.

1836
01:40:32.52 --> 01:40:35.68
He's the only one who would come on.

1837
01:40:35.68 --> 01:40:36.68
What did you think?

1838
01:40:36.68 --> 01:40:37.68
What was your nickname?

1839
01:40:37.68 --> 01:40:38.88
Did they call you tilt as well?

1840
01:40:38.88 --> 01:40:44.34
No, they call me my because the Vietnamese couldn't handle ours, so instead of my or was

1841
01:40:44.34 --> 01:40:45.34
my got it.

1842
01:40:45.34 --> 01:40:51.16
I could see him looking at you thinking, my what are you doing with that damn flower

1843
01:40:51.16 --> 01:40:54.16
on your hair?

1844
01:40:54.16 --> 01:40:58.42
Their phrase was Bukhudinky D'Al, very, very stupid.

1845
01:40:58.42 --> 01:40:59.42
Very stupid, very crazy.

1846
01:40:59.42 --> 01:41:00.42
Yeah.

1847
01:41:00.42 --> 01:41:02.42
How good did you meet in the Mieskit?

1848
01:41:02.42 --> 01:41:03.42
It sucked.

1849
01:41:03.42 --> 01:41:04.70
I had hepped.

1850
01:41:04.70 --> 01:41:10.20
And that was why we didn't have language training because they knew that with SF, but

1851
01:41:10.20 --> 01:41:15.24
for four years, like from 64 to 68, they were interpreters in place.

1852
01:41:15.24 --> 01:41:16.64
And we just locked out what happened.

1853
01:41:16.64 --> 01:41:17.64
He was the best one.

1854
01:41:17.64 --> 01:41:21.60
He spoke good English and he corrected my English.

1855
01:41:21.60 --> 01:41:22.60
And he spoke French.

1856
01:41:22.60 --> 01:41:25.92
What was his background that he had all that good language skill?

1857
01:41:25.92 --> 01:41:28.32
His dad sent him a school in Paris.

1858
01:41:28.32 --> 01:41:29.92
So he has some education in France.

1859
01:41:29.92 --> 01:41:31.32
He says, book four languages.

1860
01:41:31.32 --> 01:41:33.12
And now he's an interpreter, nom.

1861
01:41:33.12 --> 01:41:34.12
Yeah.

1862
01:41:34.12 --> 01:41:35.12
Wow.

1863
01:41:35.12 --> 01:41:42.16
Going back to the book, we came to a narrow strip of land that headed down from the hill.

1864
01:41:42.16 --> 01:41:46.88
I singled angles and chow to set out to scout ahead while the rest of us were made in place.

1865
01:41:46.88 --> 01:41:49.60
Chow was 16 years old.

1866
01:41:49.60 --> 01:41:51.20
He'd been on the team nearly two years.

1867
01:41:51.20 --> 01:41:53.48
So these kids have been on the team since he was 14 years old?

1868
01:41:53.48 --> 01:41:56.88
Yeah, one of the team got wiped out, chow, cow, and so on.

1869
01:41:56.88 --> 01:41:58.88
We're three, we'd hired and brought on.

1870
01:41:58.88 --> 01:42:02.08
We'd let a couple of us go.

1871
01:42:02.08 --> 01:42:04.80
He'd been on the team nearly two years ever since spider parks and helped build,

1872
01:42:04.80 --> 01:42:06.20
rebuilt the team in 68.

1873
01:42:06.20 --> 01:42:09.68
Chow's sensitive ears heard the NVA moving up the mountain.

1874
01:42:09.68 --> 01:42:14.08
He warned angles with hand signals and the two of them abruptly stopped moving with the enemy

1875
01:42:14.08 --> 01:42:16.80
less than 10 meters away.

1876
01:42:16.80 --> 01:42:22.000
Engles quietly broke squelching as URC 10 emergency radio several times, alerting

1877
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.60
me to the danger.

1878
01:42:24.60 --> 01:42:27.76
The rest of us were about 50 meters away.

1879
01:42:27.76 --> 01:42:30.04
The ship was about to hit the fan.

1880
01:42:30.04 --> 01:42:32.24
Because we were so far removed from all our support.

1881
01:42:32.24 --> 01:42:34.32
There was no time to waste, none at all.

1882
01:42:34.32 --> 01:42:36.04
We needed the jump.

1883
01:42:36.04 --> 01:42:37.52
We needed all the jump.

1884
01:42:37.52 --> 01:42:38.52
We could get on things.

1885
01:42:38.52 --> 01:42:45.04
So I quickly contacted a nearby OV10 Bronco and declared a prayer-refire emergency setting

1886
01:42:45.04 --> 01:42:53.24
in motion the string of responses that could save our lives and get us out.

1887
01:42:53.24 --> 01:42:57.08
Does everybody, did everyone know was that like a pro-word prayer-refire emergency?

1888
01:42:57.08 --> 01:42:59.20
Did everyone know exactly what that meant?

1889
01:42:59.20 --> 01:43:05.90
Back here in New York, and then we also had the airborne command control, but they weren't

1890
01:43:05.90 --> 01:43:10.64
always over our A, they couldn't pick up the Fox mic FM.

1891
01:43:10.64 --> 01:43:18.24
In this case, we looked out that OV10 was, I think there were one of the Ravens who had

1892
01:43:18.24 --> 01:43:23.84
their support, another CIA operation that was further west than to lay off.

1893
01:43:23.84 --> 01:43:26.96
He had been up, heard the call, and came over.

1894
01:43:26.96 --> 01:43:30.80
That was the first time we worked with OV10's.

1895
01:43:30.80 --> 01:43:32.80
Man, lucky.

1896
01:43:32.80 --> 01:43:35.30
Barry.

1897
01:43:35.30 --> 01:43:40.20
While I was talking to pilot, Chow-Sau and Ingles spring a hastily-arranged ambush that

1898
01:43:40.20 --> 01:43:42.92
startled enemy troops.

1899
01:43:42.92 --> 01:43:47.72
When their point men was less than a meter away, Chow had him with a full automatic burst

1900
01:43:47.72 --> 01:43:50.48
from his car 15 blowing him backward.

1901
01:43:50.48 --> 01:43:55.80
Chow-Sau and Ingles then hit the remaining enemy soldiers so hard and fast that they didn't

1902
01:43:55.80 --> 01:43:59.52
have time to fire a single return shot.

1903
01:43:59.52 --> 01:44:06.84
Ingles threw down a hand grenade down the hill to discourage anyone who might be around.

1904
01:44:06.84 --> 01:44:08.56
This is all done, it's happening.

1905
01:44:08.56 --> 01:44:10.56
A meter away.

1906
01:44:10.56 --> 01:44:13.20
There is really close.

1907
01:44:13.20 --> 01:44:15.24
He came up the hill, he was white.

1908
01:44:15.24 --> 01:44:21.56
That was the first really real firefight that Chow had been in.

1909
01:44:21.56 --> 01:44:25.28
He had earned his spot on the team.

1910
01:44:25.28 --> 01:44:29.28
This was his mission, and that was down at Wajan.

1911
01:44:29.28 --> 01:44:32.56
He was ahead of John.

1912
01:44:32.56 --> 01:44:36.32
As the fight began to unfold, I took stock of the situation.

1913
01:44:36.32 --> 01:44:39.66
There weren't too many places for us to go within minutes of the Broncos arrival, the pilot

1914
01:44:39.66 --> 01:44:40.66
had spotted us.

1915
01:44:40.66 --> 01:44:46.34
He said he could see more enemy activity north of us along the hill, Ingles, and Sau were

1916
01:44:46.34 --> 01:44:47.34
on.

1917
01:44:47.34 --> 01:44:52.56
He made a run on the enemy concentrations, firing his rockets into their position.

1918
01:44:52.56 --> 01:44:56.84
Then he said somewhat leconically, I got two bits of bad news for you.

1919
01:44:56.84 --> 01:44:59.32
First, Nama's socked in.

1920
01:44:59.32 --> 01:45:04.16
No assets can launch from there to extract you, which means Thailand assets, which means

1921
01:45:04.16 --> 01:45:08.80
at least three hours before the birds arrive on station.

1922
01:45:08.80 --> 01:45:13.88
Second, to your south, there are approximately a dozen troops about 800 meters out and

1923
01:45:13.88 --> 01:45:15.28
moving towards you.

1924
01:45:15.28 --> 01:45:19.60
I think you better sit tight until we get some help.

1925
01:45:19.60 --> 01:45:25.12
By 1430, a Kavir Graff replaced the Broncos and repeated this sit tight suggestion.

1926
01:45:25.12 --> 01:45:28.88
He agreed the eastern and western face of the mountain were too steep to descend.

1927
01:45:28.88 --> 01:45:34.44
He also confirmed the NVA were coming at us from the south and north.

1928
01:45:34.44 --> 01:45:39.64
They were clearly visible as they moved cautiously through the sparse vegetation.

1929
01:45:39.64 --> 01:45:43.36
For the next half hour of the enemy troops tried to locate us.

1930
01:45:43.36 --> 01:45:49.50
To discourage them, I directed several AE, A1E, Skyrader Gunruns, south of our

1931
01:45:49.50 --> 01:45:51.50
position.

1932
01:45:51.50 --> 01:45:57.98
This is another one of these things where I got to, when you get the NVA moving to your position

1933
01:45:57.98 --> 01:46:01.38
and you get told, hey, the closest extract that early as we're going to be able to get

1934
01:46:01.38 --> 01:46:04.94
you out of here is three hours from now.

1935
01:46:04.94 --> 01:46:09.78
We were up on an area where there was minimal escape routes or the jungle because everything

1936
01:46:09.78 --> 01:46:15.10
was so steep on several different sides of that little, like a little bit of a plateau

1937
01:46:15.10 --> 01:46:21.70
to him and like a trail that came down and then John and Chao had gone down further, another

1938
01:46:21.70 --> 01:46:25.50
little finger and that's where they had to fire for and he came back up, we put a

1939
01:46:25.50 --> 01:46:28.82
perimeter out and luckily we made radio contact right away.

1940
01:46:28.82 --> 01:46:36.82
So the OV10, when in with his rockets, just to say it was 2.75 and then that's when he

1941
01:46:36.82 --> 01:46:37.82
gave us the good news.

1942
01:46:37.82 --> 01:46:41.10
Yeah, good news, that it's going to be three hours at a minimum before they can get you

1943
01:46:41.10 --> 01:46:42.10
help.

1944
01:46:42.10 --> 01:46:44.46
Yeah, that's why we carried a lot of bullets.

1945
01:46:44.46 --> 01:46:46.30
Yeah, that's a lot of that.

1946
01:46:46.30 --> 01:46:47.30
It could be a long day.

1947
01:46:47.30 --> 01:46:50.02
I don't know if you can carry enough bullets for three hours, firefighters.

1948
01:46:50.02 --> 01:46:52.58
That's from Nightmare.

1949
01:46:52.58 --> 01:47:01.46
Back to the book, a 12.7 millimeter enemy gun in the valley opened up on the A1

1950
01:47:01.46 --> 01:47:02.46
ease.

1951
01:47:02.46 --> 01:47:07.10
I was sitting on the east side looking down at the valley floor after making another gun

1952
01:47:07.10 --> 01:47:11.90
run that A1e pilot told me he was pissed because the enemy gun was coming too close

1953
01:47:11.90 --> 01:47:13.90
to him and his wingman.

1954
01:47:13.90 --> 01:47:15.78
He wanted to nail him ASAP.

1955
01:47:15.78 --> 01:47:19.74
I gave the pilot what I thought was clear, what I thought were clear verbal directions

1956
01:47:19.74 --> 01:47:23.50
to where the enemy gun was located but he couldn't find them.

1957
01:47:23.50 --> 01:47:27.62
So I told him simply to watch the ground from my and follow my tracers.

1958
01:47:27.62 --> 01:47:31.74
At that I fired a short burst toward a clump of trees in the valley that were maybe 500

1959
01:47:31.74 --> 01:47:33.22
meters away.

1960
01:47:33.22 --> 01:47:36.34
The pilot had no trouble seeing where my tracers hit.

1961
01:47:36.34 --> 01:47:37.34
Thanks partner.

1962
01:47:37.34 --> 01:47:40.66
He said in the low southern draw and then rolled in for the kill.

1963
01:47:40.66 --> 01:47:43.58
It was the most beautiful napalm dive I've ever seen.

1964
01:47:43.58 --> 01:47:47.26
The pilot came out of the sky pointing straight down his engine screaming.

1965
01:47:47.26 --> 01:47:52.34
It reminded me of dive bombers I'd seen on the television series of victory at sea.

1966
01:47:52.34 --> 01:47:56.14
I really thought I was watching a World War II movie because I was so high up in the

1967
01:47:56.14 --> 01:47:57.14
mountain.

1968
01:47:57.14 --> 01:48:01.90
I was looking down on the sky radar when at the absolute last second he released a napalm

1969
01:48:01.90 --> 01:48:05.74
canister and pulled out of his gutsy dive.

1970
01:48:05.74 --> 01:48:07.26
It was a perfect strike.

1971
01:48:07.26 --> 01:48:12.58
The impact generated a secondary explosion, which was probably the gunner's spare ammo going

1972
01:48:12.58 --> 01:48:14.10
off around him.

1973
01:48:14.10 --> 01:48:16.70
Black oily smoke billed up.

1974
01:48:16.70 --> 01:48:20.34
There was not a whisper of sound from the former gun in placement.

1975
01:48:20.34 --> 01:48:24.82
For the next three hours I directed air strike after air strike around our position and

1976
01:48:24.82 --> 01:48:28.02
in the valley.

1977
01:48:28.02 --> 01:48:36.14
At 1730 hours we heard the very welcome sound of the HH3's coming our way.

1978
01:48:36.14 --> 01:48:40.62
As they approached in the distance the NVA pushed up from the north and hit sounds claim

1979
01:48:40.62 --> 01:48:41.62
more.

1980
01:48:41.62 --> 01:48:44.86
Further south of us another machine gun opened up from the valley.

1981
01:48:44.86 --> 01:48:48.74
As I gave Kavie the compass heading to its position I caught sight of an enemy soldier

1982
01:48:48.74 --> 01:48:51.66
climbing a tree about 100 meters away.

1983
01:48:51.66 --> 01:48:56.14
He had handed his RPG launcher to a nearby comrade while he got into that position.

1984
01:48:56.14 --> 01:49:01.14
It was clear he was looking for RTI to ho or hoping to nail an air force chopper.

1985
01:49:01.14 --> 01:49:04.14
I was too far away to shout and alert to the other team members.

1986
01:49:04.14 --> 01:49:08.94
For the first time in my 16 months of running missions I extended the collapsible stock

1987
01:49:08.94 --> 01:49:11.30
of my car 15.

1988
01:49:11.30 --> 01:49:14.94
Normally it remained compressed to minimize the length of the weapon but now I wanted

1989
01:49:14.94 --> 01:49:19.18
it extended to help stabilize my aim.

1990
01:49:19.18 --> 01:49:24.66
Once I was ready I carefully put the NVA soldier in my gun sight.

1991
01:49:24.66 --> 01:49:28.34
In that fleeting moment I felt like God.

1992
01:49:28.34 --> 01:49:33.34
I had the power of life and death concentrated in my finger tip.

1993
01:49:33.34 --> 01:49:38.86
As I grounded my elbow to steady my arm I found myself silently hoping the NVA

1994
01:49:38.86 --> 01:49:45.02
troop would be unable to find the team and simply climb back down the tree.

1995
01:49:45.02 --> 01:49:51.18
He didn't see either me or my car 15 in a troubling way it seemed unfair or unsportsman

1996
01:49:51.18 --> 01:49:52.18
like.

1997
01:49:52.18 --> 01:49:56.30
But war is not designed to be a sporting contest.

1998
01:49:56.30 --> 01:50:01.26
If the situation were reversed I had little doubt what he would opt to do.

1999
01:50:01.26 --> 01:50:06.42
Although these reflections took less than a moment to form they caused deep soul surging

2000
01:50:06.42 --> 01:50:08.54
on my part.

2001
01:50:08.54 --> 01:50:17.26
I found myself recalling my third grade Sunday school teacher Mrs. Murdoch Reichert and her

2002
01:50:17.26 --> 01:50:23.22
treatment of the ten commandments especially the one that proclaims thou shout not kill.

2003
01:50:23.22 --> 01:50:28.38
Halified met this tree soldier on the streets of Hanoi without guns and beyond the rhetoric

2004
01:50:28.38 --> 01:50:33.82
of politicians we'd probably be able to find lots of common ground between us and dozens

2005
01:50:33.82 --> 01:50:37.42
of purely human things to talk about.

2006
01:50:37.42 --> 01:50:41.98
But that could not be not now not at this given moment.

2007
01:50:41.98 --> 01:50:46.30
Also in my mind was the knowledge he would receive a medal if he ever managed to kill

2008
01:50:46.30 --> 01:50:49.82
me or one of my team members.

2009
01:50:49.82 --> 01:50:55.66
As I watched and reflected his comrade reached up and handed him to the rocket launcher.

2010
01:50:55.66 --> 01:50:58.02
I could tell it was unloaded.

2011
01:50:58.02 --> 01:51:06.50
What I had come to think of my personal NVA moved a little farther up the tree craning

2012
01:51:06.50 --> 01:51:08.66
is neck to find us.

2013
01:51:08.66 --> 01:51:13.10
From the corner of my eye I could see sun moved towards south.

2014
01:51:13.10 --> 01:51:17.94
And at that very moment someone passed up around for the RPG I still refused to yield

2015
01:51:17.94 --> 01:51:19.18
to the inevitable.

2016
01:51:19.18 --> 01:51:23.66
I continued to hold on to the stubborn hope that he would abandon his cause climbed

2017
01:51:23.66 --> 01:51:26.58
down the damn tree and walk away.

2018
01:51:26.58 --> 01:51:30.34
Instead he fitted the round into the end of the launcher.

2019
01:51:30.34 --> 01:51:35.54
I still watched, still I waited even after he'd put the weapon to his shoulder.

2020
01:51:35.54 --> 01:51:40.34
As he nestled his neck against it and began to take careful aim toward us, I leveled my

2021
01:51:40.34 --> 01:51:43.70
sight on his head, I pulled the trigger.

2022
01:51:43.70 --> 01:51:47.66
A single yet timeless shot.

2023
01:51:47.66 --> 01:51:57.30
He dropped from the tree out of sight, but not out of my mind.

2024
01:51:57.30 --> 01:52:00.10
One of those moments.

2025
01:52:00.10 --> 01:52:05.82
How far was he away?

2026
01:52:05.82 --> 01:52:06.82
Was it range?

2027
01:52:06.82 --> 01:52:11.22
He was well over, maybe a football field and a half two fields.

2028
01:52:11.22 --> 01:52:17.38
I was like on the cusp of the hill and he was around on the side and I could see

2029
01:52:17.38 --> 01:52:19.62
that there was like a tree that he climbed up.

2030
01:52:19.62 --> 01:52:22.14
That was above the regular vegetation.

2031
01:52:22.14 --> 01:52:25.42
So I'm not sure how high he went, but I could see him at the beginning.

2032
01:52:25.42 --> 01:52:31.90
I just waited because then when he got that damn RPG.

2033
01:52:31.90 --> 01:52:36.94
Yeah, then it's time to do what you got to do.

2034
01:52:36.94 --> 01:52:41.74
Once again, I want to make this claim.

2035
01:52:41.74 --> 01:52:44.26
I'm not reading this whole book.

2036
01:52:44.26 --> 01:52:49.66
I'm just jumping around and you should read this whole book if you're listening to this.

2037
01:52:49.66 --> 01:52:55.10
Because I'm getting 10% of what's going on in here.

2038
01:52:55.10 --> 01:52:56.62
This part continues on.

2039
01:52:56.62 --> 01:53:04.70
Seconds later, one of the approaching HH3 pilots broke into my reverie by commenting somewhat

2040
01:53:04.70 --> 01:53:09.90
frantically on the heavy ground fire he was taking from the mountain south of our position.

2041
01:53:09.90 --> 01:53:12.14
There was a moment's hesitation before he sat down.

2042
01:53:12.14 --> 01:53:15.30
I think we have some mechanical problems.

2043
01:53:15.30 --> 01:53:17.06
We're going home.

2044
01:53:17.06 --> 01:53:19.54
We could see the helicopters and they looked fine to us.

2045
01:53:19.54 --> 01:53:22.94
They were less than two kilometers out when they turned and disappeared into the fading

2046
01:53:22.94 --> 01:53:23.94
sun.

2047
01:53:23.94 --> 01:53:29.46
And I'll sink as they vanished after cursing our lack of, after cursing our lack of look

2048
01:53:29.46 --> 01:53:35.86
and the pilot I told the team to take an app is going to be a long night.

2049
01:53:35.86 --> 01:53:37.66
So there goes your ride out.

2050
01:53:37.66 --> 01:53:40.98
You've been there for freaking ever.

2051
01:53:40.98 --> 01:53:44.94
And you see those guys say we got some mechanical problems throughout here.

2052
01:53:44.94 --> 01:53:52.06
Yeah, that's a very unhappy moment.

2053
01:53:52.06 --> 01:53:57.98
So you guys, you tell the guys to take a nap, you take a little map.

2054
01:53:57.98 --> 01:54:00.98
And back to the book around 1930, Ingles roused me, wake up.

2055
01:54:00.98 --> 01:54:02.74
You're not going to believe this shit.

2056
01:54:02.74 --> 01:54:08.86
As I came around, he was pointing south up the mountain side from about 30 meters from

2057
01:54:08.86 --> 01:54:10.34
our perimeter.

2058
01:54:10.34 --> 01:54:16.10
And as far as we could see, there were dozens and dozens of lanterns bouncing and swinging

2059
01:54:16.10 --> 01:54:17.10
along.

2060
01:54:17.10 --> 01:54:23.74
Each lantern was carried by an enemy soldier and between each lantern were many more soldiers.

2061
01:54:23.74 --> 01:54:26.54
The same scene was unfolding to the north of us.

2062
01:54:26.54 --> 01:54:30.22
The NVA were coming up the hill on mass.

2063
01:54:30.22 --> 01:54:34.86
We could see at least a dozen trucks unloading hundreds of NVA troops in the valley.

2064
01:54:34.86 --> 01:54:39.10
Also across the valley and up on the plateau to the east, there were hundreds of lights

2065
01:54:39.10 --> 01:54:45.62
moving everywhere, like swarming fireflies, flitting around in the night.

2066
01:54:45.62 --> 01:54:52.62
And a smaller valley west of us still more lights, more NVA, more trouble, just more, more

2067
01:54:52.62 --> 01:54:56.66
and more of everything we did not want to see.

2068
01:54:56.66 --> 01:55:02.62
I felt the tremendous weight of just how small RT Idaho was, how terribly isolated and

2069
01:55:02.62 --> 01:55:07.78
alone we were, how incredibly vulnerable.

2070
01:55:07.78 --> 01:55:11.14
All of a sudden I found myself praying.

2071
01:55:11.14 --> 01:55:16.30
For reasons only he understands my prayer was answered.

2072
01:55:16.30 --> 01:55:23.06
As a few minutes later, the first specter C130 gunship arrived on target with its 220

2073
01:55:23.06 --> 01:55:32.82
millimeter cannons and 4.7.62 millimeter mini guns ready for action.

2074
01:55:32.82 --> 01:55:39.14
That had to be the most horrifying thing that you could ever think of.

2075
01:55:39.14 --> 01:55:46.26
You wake up and you see these enemy lights surrounding you, hundreds of them.

2076
01:55:46.26 --> 01:55:47.70
And you know that they're looking.

2077
01:55:47.70 --> 01:55:52.66
Those hundreds, maybe thousands of enemy personnel are looking for you and your six-man

2078
01:55:52.66 --> 01:55:53.66
team.

2079
01:55:53.66 --> 01:55:54.98
Oh yeah, they're coming for us.

2080
01:55:54.98 --> 01:56:00.30
And it was just like, yeah, I've never forget when John woke me up.

2081
01:56:00.30 --> 01:56:02.14
I mean, it's just one of those moments.

2082
01:56:02.14 --> 01:56:08.10
He's just like, oh my God, fuck me to tears.

2083
01:56:08.10 --> 01:56:09.10
Help me, Lord.

2084
01:56:09.10 --> 01:56:10.10
Yeah, please wake up.

2085
01:56:10.10 --> 01:56:11.10
You're not going to be happy.

2086
01:56:11.10 --> 01:56:13.10
I'm all keeping praying right about now.

2087
01:56:13.10 --> 01:56:17.18
If you're not praying back to New Jersey, please start praying now.

2088
01:56:17.18 --> 01:56:21.78
And then what do you have any idea did you ever find out what where the C130 came from,

2089
01:56:21.78 --> 01:56:22.78
where the specter came from?

2090
01:56:22.78 --> 01:56:25.14
How to be an Italian.

2091
01:56:25.14 --> 01:56:26.54
And so it just randomly showed up.

2092
01:56:26.54 --> 01:56:31.26
Oh, no, somebody, the cubby that we had talked to earlier, who brought the hill at

2093
01:56:31.26 --> 01:56:33.70
cop just out.

2094
01:56:33.70 --> 01:56:36.62
Because the cubby was still trying to work with us for other ARS assets.

2095
01:56:36.62 --> 01:56:39.70
And when it got dark, we lost everything, conventional.

2096
01:56:39.70 --> 01:56:44.66
So all the A1's, Phantom Jets were gone.

2097
01:56:44.66 --> 01:56:51.30
And they didn't have helicopter gunships out of Thailand, just transport vehicle of aircraft.

2098
01:56:51.30 --> 01:56:53.74
So we had that quiet spell.

2099
01:56:53.74 --> 01:56:56.62
And so they had notified specter.

2100
01:56:56.62 --> 01:57:01.14
And they had told me that they were going to try to get a specter out.

2101
01:57:01.14 --> 01:57:03.18
And had you worked with a specter before?

2102
01:57:03.18 --> 01:57:09.82
Yes, we used before, but nothing like this night.

2103
01:57:09.82 --> 01:57:15.62
So for anyone that does know the C130 specter gunship is it's a, it's a C130, which is

2104
01:57:15.62 --> 01:57:17.50
a big transport aircraft.

2105
01:57:17.50 --> 01:57:21.30
But they put some big weapon tree in this case, 220 millimeter cannons.

2106
01:57:21.30 --> 01:57:26.94
And four, 7.6 to many guns, which fire 6000 rounds a minute.

2107
01:57:26.94 --> 01:57:27.94
Correct.

2108
01:57:27.94 --> 01:57:28.94
Something crazy.

2109
01:57:28.94 --> 01:57:29.94
Oh, yeah.

2110
01:57:29.94 --> 01:57:32.26
Yeah, it's like a laser beam when the tracer's come out of these things.

2111
01:57:32.26 --> 01:57:35.26
Or dog piss it from the sky or that.

2112
01:57:35.26 --> 01:57:40.98
And so these guys show up.

2113
01:57:40.98 --> 01:57:42.42
And here we go back to the book.

2114
01:57:42.42 --> 01:57:47.54
This was this awesome wave, a ray of weapon tree could be made to form a magic link with

2115
01:57:47.54 --> 01:57:49.10
my emergency strobe light.

2116
01:57:49.10 --> 01:57:52.94
Once that link was established, the gunner could dance the incredible fire power of his

2117
01:57:52.94 --> 01:57:59.46
four mini guns, just 24,000 rounds per minute total within five feet of us.

2118
01:57:59.46 --> 01:58:00.46
It was wondrous.

2119
01:58:00.46 --> 01:58:01.74
It was miraculous.

2120
01:58:01.74 --> 01:58:03.58
It could save us.

2121
01:58:03.58 --> 01:58:08.94
On this particular night, however, we were faced with a highly unusual, if not unique

2122
01:58:08.94 --> 01:58:14.26
problem, the pilot circling over us reported he couldn't pick out the teams.

2123
01:58:14.26 --> 01:58:18.02
Strobe light because there were so many other lights surrounding us.

2124
01:58:18.02 --> 01:58:22.54
The myriad of lanterns must have made the dark earth look like a pin cushion illuminated

2125
01:58:22.54 --> 01:58:23.90
from within.

2126
01:58:23.90 --> 01:58:27.02
No problem, I said, I'll turn off mine.

2127
01:58:27.02 --> 01:58:28.90
You get the rest.

2128
01:58:28.90 --> 01:58:33.34
Get the ridge line west of the valley, give me a minute to put my team on the safe side

2129
01:58:33.34 --> 01:58:35.62
of the mountain.

2130
01:58:35.62 --> 01:58:38.94
The specter commenced to putting on an amazing display of fire power.

2131
01:58:38.94 --> 01:58:42.24
Once again, we gave thanks for being on the right side of the fight, the one that had

2132
01:58:42.24 --> 01:58:45.82
Uncle Sam's Air Force and Specter on its team.

2133
01:58:45.82 --> 01:58:49.82
After ripping up scores of body and carving out large patches of empty darkness on the

2134
01:58:49.82 --> 01:58:53.38
ridge line, the specter directed his deadly fire into the valley.

2135
01:58:53.38 --> 01:58:55.14
More lanterns were snuffed out.

2136
01:58:55.14 --> 01:59:01.06
The darkness spread like a stain as lights and lives were extinguished.

2137
01:59:01.06 --> 01:59:05.66
The specter crew finally expanded all of its ordinance and the pilot apologized for running

2138
01:59:05.66 --> 01:59:06.66
out of ammo.

2139
01:59:06.66 --> 01:59:09.98
The next specter arrived seconds later.

2140
01:59:09.98 --> 01:59:13.42
So they knew you were in a bad way and they were in a common.

2141
01:59:13.42 --> 01:59:18.90
Oh yeah, we were so happy that the second one showed up because now the lights were out

2142
01:59:18.90 --> 01:59:21.74
so we could turn a strobe light on and have direct calm.

2143
01:59:21.74 --> 01:59:24.02
Did they have night vision back then in the specters?

2144
01:59:24.02 --> 01:59:25.02
Oh yeah.

2145
01:59:25.02 --> 01:59:26.02
They had everything.

2146
01:59:26.02 --> 01:59:27.02
See your force.

2147
01:59:27.02 --> 01:59:28.02
Yeah.

2148
01:59:28.02 --> 01:59:30.02
Yes it is.

2149
01:59:30.02 --> 01:59:31.02
Yeah.

2150
01:59:31.02 --> 01:59:35.94
I mean the specter gun chip is just the most awesome asset to have overhead for ground

2151
01:59:35.94 --> 01:59:40.06
support because the capability, the visual capability that it has and then the accuracy

2152
01:59:40.06 --> 01:59:41.06
of fire.

2153
01:59:41.06 --> 01:59:43.86
Yeah, this is 1977 you think all I could do was.

2154
01:59:43.86 --> 01:59:44.86
Oh.

2155
01:59:44.86 --> 01:59:45.86
That's what they can do now.

2156
01:59:45.86 --> 01:59:46.86
Oh yeah.

2157
01:59:46.86 --> 01:59:48.86
Yeah.

2158
01:59:48.86 --> 01:59:51.30
The next specter arrived seconds later.

2159
01:59:51.30 --> 01:59:55.22
He quickly locked onto our strobe and worked the southern slope with a vengeance marching

2160
01:59:55.22 --> 01:59:57.86
his guns right up to the trail.

2161
01:59:57.86 --> 02:00:01.30
Right up the trail to the top of the ridge beyond our line of sight.

2162
02:00:01.30 --> 02:00:04.70
He worked then he worked the valley and the southeast and mountain ridge.

2163
02:00:04.70 --> 02:00:09.54
A third specter arrived and worked our southern perimeter again systematically walking its

2164
02:00:09.54 --> 02:00:11.82
fiery lead up the mountain around us.

2165
02:00:11.82 --> 02:00:14.82
There was no longer any light above us, no moon.

2166
02:00:14.82 --> 02:00:15.82
No stars.

2167
02:00:15.82 --> 02:00:18.78
The only sound was the roar of the C130 overhead.

2168
02:00:18.78 --> 02:00:23.42
And the absolute darkness he could not be seen until his guns opened up.

2169
02:00:23.42 --> 02:00:28.50
Then tongues of fire seemed to erupt out of nowhere like spontaneously generated bolts of

2170
02:00:28.50 --> 02:00:34.34
lightning and the outlines of specter's fuselage would appear in brief flashes as a pale

2171
02:00:34.34 --> 02:00:39.30
and ghostly silhouette and airborne grim reaper.

2172
02:00:39.30 --> 02:00:45.58
When specter moved to other targets we could hear the enemy dragging away his dead.

2173
02:00:45.58 --> 02:00:52.58
The 0-0-45, saw said some NVA were in the grass about 20 meters south of us.

2174
02:00:52.58 --> 02:00:55.98
A few minutes later he blew the claymores.

2175
02:00:55.98 --> 02:00:59.42
We all instinctively flinched for some reason claymores always sounded more thunderous at

2176
02:00:59.42 --> 02:01:01.66
night and caught you by surprise.

2177
02:01:01.66 --> 02:01:06.94
After the dust settled we again heard NVA troops dragging away their bodies.

2178
02:01:06.94 --> 02:01:08.82
They never spoke.

2179
02:01:08.82 --> 02:01:11.34
We heard no cries of pain.

2180
02:01:11.34 --> 02:01:17.58
Their silent execution of grim duty was at once eerie and admirable.

2181
02:01:17.58 --> 02:01:19.82
Jesus they were tough.

2182
02:01:19.82 --> 02:01:25.38
They fought hard and died hard.

2183
02:01:25.38 --> 02:01:29.54
So you wouldn't even hear these guys getting wounded getting blown up and they wouldn't

2184
02:01:29.54 --> 02:01:31.26
even scream they wouldn't cry.

2185
02:01:31.26 --> 02:01:32.26
We just silenced.

2186
02:01:32.26 --> 02:01:34.26
It was amazing.

2187
02:01:34.26 --> 02:01:37.70
It's my mind boggling.

2188
02:01:37.70 --> 02:01:41.70
I think that all those guys were just dead.

2189
02:01:41.70 --> 02:01:43.70
They had to be wounded.

2190
02:01:43.70 --> 02:01:45.70
Of course not a sound.

2191
02:01:45.70 --> 02:01:49.14
But you can hear them dragging the bodies.

2192
02:01:49.14 --> 02:01:55.70
I don't know how many we killed that night.

2193
02:01:55.70 --> 02:02:00.02
Back to the book shortly before the next specter arrived I moved my team away from the edge

2194
02:02:00.02 --> 02:02:04.42
of the slope and into the high grass as sound placed one more claymore down on the northern

2195
02:02:04.42 --> 02:02:08.66
slope and short order specter locked onto our strobe light.

2196
02:02:08.66 --> 02:02:12.38
He reported that cloud cover was beginning to roll in the AO.

2197
02:02:12.38 --> 02:02:16.42
When specter dropped, when specter then dropped illumination flares over a south-high

2198
02:02:16.42 --> 02:02:19.42
sown as big as pizza tins.

2199
02:02:19.42 --> 02:02:25.38
NVA troops were within five meters of us all of about 15 feet.

2200
02:02:25.38 --> 02:02:30.02
Blinded by intense white light they could not immediately make us out as we nestled into

2201
02:02:30.02 --> 02:02:32.30
the high grass.

2202
02:02:32.30 --> 02:02:35.14
But this was a little real consolation.

2203
02:02:35.14 --> 02:02:38.54
They would spot us soon enough.

2204
02:02:38.54 --> 02:02:42.46
I whispered into the radio asking specter just how close he could bring the ordinance

2205
02:02:42.46 --> 02:02:44.94
to my strobe light.

2206
02:02:44.94 --> 02:02:48.18
As close as you want it.

2207
02:02:48.18 --> 02:02:52.66
He first replied, I want it five feet in front of my southern perimeter.

2208
02:02:52.66 --> 02:02:55.14
I responded, well he hesitated.

2209
02:02:55.14 --> 02:02:58.58
I can't bring it in any closer than 25 meters from your perimeter unless you're willing

2210
02:02:58.58 --> 02:03:01.18
to accept responsibility for any casualties.

2211
02:03:01.18 --> 02:03:04.50
We may accidentally inflict.

2212
02:03:04.50 --> 02:03:06.98
We have to record you saying it.

2213
02:03:06.98 --> 02:03:10.14
I wanted to scream you dumb fucking idiot.

2214
02:03:10.14 --> 02:03:13.86
They're five meters away and you're going to quote and you're quoting regulations to

2215
02:03:13.86 --> 02:03:14.86
me.

2216
02:03:14.86 --> 02:03:17.26
Just kill the fuckers before they kill us.

2217
02:03:17.26 --> 02:03:21.14
Instead and feeling like a complete fool, I whispered that I was fully willing to accept

2218
02:03:21.14 --> 02:03:25.18
responsibility for any and all casualties that may or may not result from his efforts to

2219
02:03:25.18 --> 02:03:27.30
save our lives.

2220
02:03:27.30 --> 02:03:32.26
I followed up by saying now, bringing it in as tight as you can to the light.

2221
02:03:32.26 --> 02:03:33.74
I'm holding it up now.

2222
02:03:33.74 --> 02:03:35.30
Move south from my light.

2223
02:03:35.30 --> 02:03:38.18
I'll take my chances with you.

2224
02:03:38.18 --> 02:03:43.86
The gun crew finally opened fire and there in the fuselage cracked over our heads.

2225
02:03:43.86 --> 02:03:48.50
The ground in front of us erupted as thousands of rounds ripped into it kicking up stones

2226
02:03:48.50 --> 02:03:52.70
and dirt and tossing NVA soldiers around like rag dolls.

2227
02:03:52.70 --> 02:03:57.14
The inspector solely marched his stuff southward from our strobe light moving up the

2228
02:03:57.14 --> 02:04:00.98
ridge.

2229
02:04:00.98 --> 02:04:02.30
Danger close.

2230
02:04:02.30 --> 02:04:04.66
Oh yeah.

2231
02:04:04.66 --> 02:04:10.82
So the flare goes off and south sees that the enemy are five meters from where you're

2232
02:04:10.82 --> 02:04:11.82
at.

2233
02:04:11.82 --> 02:04:14.86
I didn't really tell that close.

2234
02:04:14.86 --> 02:04:15.86
They were that quiet.

2235
02:04:15.86 --> 02:04:20.38
They kept coming all night.

2236
02:04:20.38 --> 02:04:25.66
Because it was pitch black and they were just so quiet and they just probably moved

2237
02:04:25.66 --> 02:04:28.54
during the wind or moving when rounds were hit and whatever and they made it to

2238
02:04:28.54 --> 02:04:32.46
fully in five meters.

2239
02:04:32.46 --> 02:04:35.74
I mean that's when you're making this radio call.

2240
02:04:35.74 --> 02:04:38.38
It's a miracle they couldn't hear you and they just didn't start shooting towards

2241
02:04:38.38 --> 02:04:40.22
your direction when you make the radio call.

2242
02:04:40.22 --> 02:04:41.22
That's what I was waiting for.

2243
02:04:41.22 --> 02:04:46.74
I was waiting for that next AK to open up on my voice.

2244
02:04:46.74 --> 02:04:48.70
Especially when they're asking you for the.

2245
02:04:48.70 --> 02:04:50.70
Oh yeah.

2246
02:04:50.70 --> 02:04:52.70
Oh.

2247
02:04:52.70 --> 02:04:55.70
You talk about moments.

2248
02:04:55.70 --> 02:05:01.70
That's insane.

2249
02:05:01.70 --> 02:05:02.70
Totally.

2250
02:05:02.70 --> 02:05:04.70
I want to what the I mean that's.

2251
02:05:04.70 --> 02:05:07.70
I'm actually surprised that they could pull off five meters.

2252
02:05:07.70 --> 02:05:09.70
It was just for anyone that's listening.

2253
02:05:09.70 --> 02:05:10.70
It doesn't understand this.

2254
02:05:10.70 --> 02:05:11.70
This aircraft.

2255
02:05:11.70 --> 02:05:13.70
I don't know what what altitude were they at.

2256
02:05:13.70 --> 02:05:14.70
Do you have any idea?

2257
02:05:14.70 --> 02:05:17.70
They had to be at least two three thousand feet above us.

2258
02:05:17.70 --> 02:05:22.70
So I don't know what the height of the mountain range or that.

2259
02:05:22.70 --> 02:05:25.70
A little plateau that we were on here.

2260
02:05:25.70 --> 02:05:27.70
But several thousand feet above us.

2261
02:05:27.70 --> 02:05:31.70
They locked in and put rounds within five meters of you.

2262
02:05:31.70 --> 02:05:32.70
Oh yeah.

2263
02:05:32.70 --> 02:05:33.70
Yeah.

2264
02:05:33.70 --> 02:05:37.70
I mean I could see they do it now because now they've got computers and they've got all these.

2265
02:05:37.70 --> 02:05:40.70
I mean just incredible systems up there.

2266
02:05:40.70 --> 02:05:42.70
I mean I've been in the modern AC 130.

2267
02:05:42.70 --> 02:05:44.70
They're ridiculous.

2268
02:05:44.70 --> 02:05:45.70
Oh, that's right.

2269
02:05:45.70 --> 02:05:46.70
You've been in it.

2270
02:05:46.70 --> 02:05:52.70
It's crazy like they're the capability that they have is just completely ridiculous.

2271
02:05:52.70 --> 02:05:54.70
But I can't know.

2272
02:05:54.70 --> 02:05:59.70
I mean I know there's no way they had that same technology back in 1970.

2273
02:05:59.70 --> 02:06:00.70
It's impossible.

2274
02:06:00.70 --> 02:06:05.70
You know there's more technology in my phone than is in 1970.

2275
02:06:05.70 --> 02:06:07.70
Oh those Air Force guys were good.

2276
02:06:07.70 --> 02:06:11.70
And now we just kept a strobe light right pointing at the aircraft.

2277
02:06:11.70 --> 02:06:13.70
So when it circled.

2278
02:06:13.70 --> 02:06:17.70
I mean whoever had the MCD and I did it for a while then we take turns with it.

2279
02:06:17.70 --> 02:06:19.70
But we always followed the aircraft.

2280
02:06:19.70 --> 02:06:22.70
So it would be directly linked into that strobe light.

2281
02:06:22.70 --> 02:06:25.70
That's right because you had your you put the strobe into the MCD nine right?

2282
02:06:25.70 --> 02:06:26.70
Yeah.

2283
02:06:26.70 --> 02:06:27.70
So it was only directional.

2284
02:06:27.70 --> 02:06:28.70
Right.

2285
02:06:28.70 --> 02:06:29.70
So we go straight up there.

2286
02:06:29.70 --> 02:06:32.70
So anybody in the ground wouldn't see it.

2287
02:06:32.70 --> 02:06:36.70
So that's what's happening as these guys are five meters from you.

2288
02:06:36.70 --> 02:06:38.70
Oh yeah.

2289
02:06:38.70 --> 02:06:48.70
This is ridiculous.

2290
02:06:48.70 --> 02:06:51.70
That's what I thought that night also.

2291
02:06:51.70 --> 02:06:52.70
Yeah.

2292
02:06:52.70 --> 02:06:54.70
Send me a king be please.

2293
02:06:54.70 --> 02:06:57.70
Yeah.

2294
02:06:57.70 --> 02:07:00.70
Back to the book between verse and fire he dropped more fliers.

2295
02:07:00.70 --> 02:07:03.70
This time the illumination revealed no movement south of us.

2296
02:07:03.70 --> 02:07:07.70
Instead, jowgli flee reported that there were Bo-ku dead VC.

2297
02:07:07.70 --> 02:07:12.70
With the south quiet specter started on the northern flank and marshes fire down.

2298
02:07:12.70 --> 02:07:17.70
The finger of land when I reported hearing more trucks and the valley the gun crews pounded them in

2299
02:07:17.70 --> 02:07:18.70
Des Islands.

2300
02:07:18.70 --> 02:07:21.70
Another specter circle us and laid down its deadly ring of fire again.

2301
02:07:21.70 --> 02:07:24.70
Bring it to within five feet of our strobe light.

2302
02:07:24.70 --> 02:07:31.70
Somewhere around 0 400 some early morning fog and Hayes moved in as the last specter moved out.

2303
02:07:31.70 --> 02:07:34.70
Once the specter was gone, the NVA started moving toward us.

2304
02:07:34.70 --> 02:07:39.70
Once more from the south only this time with real vengeance.

2305
02:07:39.70 --> 02:07:45.70
Spectered killed a lot of their comrades and they were in no move to back off.

2306
02:07:45.70 --> 02:07:52.70
But we managed to hold them off by employing what we called our guess whether I'm throwing a grenade or not tactic.

2307
02:07:52.70 --> 02:07:55.70
Which had a wave making almost enemy.

2308
02:07:55.70 --> 02:07:57.70
Almost any enemy think twice.

2309
02:07:57.70 --> 02:07:58.70
What was that all about?

2310
02:07:58.70 --> 02:08:00.70
I think covered in the book but you wrote about it.

2311
02:08:00.70 --> 02:08:04.70
Well, it's another version of Hayden goes seek with the...

2312
02:08:04.70 --> 02:08:06.70
...cure we only held them to Mount O'Grenates.

2313
02:08:06.70 --> 02:08:08.70
We had used some already.

2314
02:08:08.70 --> 02:08:13.70
And so we knew that when we threw the grenade when the land that you'd hear them run.

2315
02:08:13.70 --> 02:08:15.70
That you'd hear.

2316
02:08:15.70 --> 02:08:20.70
So we knew we'd get low so Sal went out and got stones.

2317
02:08:20.70 --> 02:08:24.70
And the team went out and got stones somehow.

2318
02:08:24.70 --> 02:08:26.70
They came back.

2319
02:08:26.70 --> 02:08:31.70
So we'd wait until he would tell us somehow he...

2320
02:08:31.70 --> 02:08:33.70
...sacchar just tell where they were.

2321
02:08:33.70 --> 02:08:37.70
I didn't have that kind of defense or skill set.

2322
02:08:37.70 --> 02:08:41.70
So his signal he would let us know or he would just throw the rock.

2323
02:08:41.70 --> 02:08:44.70
He threw the rock in here and scurry away like rats.

2324
02:08:44.70 --> 02:08:46.70
Because they thought the grenade was coming.

2325
02:08:46.70 --> 02:08:47.70
So we threw another rock.

2326
02:08:47.70 --> 02:08:49.70
So it'd be less scuring.

2327
02:08:49.70 --> 02:08:51.70
So then we'd wait.

2328
02:08:51.70 --> 02:08:53.70
So another rock would be less scuring.

2329
02:08:53.70 --> 02:08:56.70
We'd throw another hang grenade.

2330
02:08:56.70 --> 02:08:59.70
So when that... this went on for quite a while.

2331
02:08:59.70 --> 02:09:00.70
We always carried...

2332
02:09:00.70 --> 02:09:01.70
...at least ten hang grenades.

2333
02:09:01.70 --> 02:09:02.70
I always carried these ten...

2334
02:09:02.70 --> 02:09:03.70
...are in ditch out.

2335
02:09:03.70 --> 02:09:05.70
I carry ten yourself.

2336
02:09:05.70 --> 02:09:06.70
Oh yeah.

2337
02:09:06.70 --> 02:09:10.70
Sure I had a couple on a strap and always in the rock sack.

2338
02:09:12.70 --> 02:09:15.70
And that's why you just put that mission.

2339
02:09:15.70 --> 02:09:16.70
Yeah, apparently.

2340
02:09:16.70 --> 02:09:18.70
A little bit I realized you needed thirty.

2341
02:09:18.70 --> 02:09:19.70
Yeah.

2342
02:09:19.70 --> 02:09:30.70
We've stayed from firing our weapons because the muzzle flashes would have marked our position too clearly for the RPG gunners who had fired several inaccurate rounds at us during the night.

2343
02:09:30.70 --> 02:09:32.70
Fortunately they hadn't come very close.

2344
02:09:32.70 --> 02:09:35.70
We played these deadly games with the enemy until sunrise.

2345
02:09:35.70 --> 02:09:39.70
At one point we broke a major thrust by tossing a white phosphorus grenade.

2346
02:09:39.70 --> 02:09:42.70
One of the most fearsome things I know of.

2347
02:09:42.70 --> 02:09:46.70
We couldn't see them but we could smell burning flesh.

2348
02:09:46.70 --> 02:09:54.70
At around 0630 we heard an NVA officer or senior NCO calling roll in the distance.

2349
02:09:54.70 --> 02:09:58.70
It appeared few people answered him.

2350
02:09:58.70 --> 02:10:05.70
As the sun finally burned off the fog, we worked tactical air strikes with fandoms and sky raders.

2351
02:10:05.70 --> 02:10:09.70
A couple of machine gun positions to open fire and hit one of the A1E's.

2352
02:10:09.70 --> 02:10:13.70
A fandom blew one of the gun crews to hell with a 500 pound bomb.

2353
02:10:13.70 --> 02:10:18.70
The A1E knocked out the second one minutes after it opened fire.

2354
02:10:18.70 --> 02:10:27.70
Because there were no more specter aircraft to call on, I continued to working with a pair of A1E's, having them make run after run.

2355
02:10:27.70 --> 02:10:36.70
I could talk directly to the lead pilot and he and his wingman executed my every request or direction flawlessly.

2356
02:10:36.70 --> 02:10:39.70
Damn you had to love those A1E pilots.

2357
02:10:39.70 --> 02:10:44.70
Finally we could hear in the distance the sweet sweet sound of approaching helicopters.

2358
02:10:44.70 --> 02:10:48.70
Big HH3's churning their way are way.

2359
02:10:48.70 --> 02:10:50.70
It was time to pull out all the stops.

2360
02:10:50.70 --> 02:10:56.70
I used every available support aircraft, F4's and A1E's to raise hell and suppress enemy fire.

2361
02:10:56.70 --> 02:11:02.70
As they roared in with guns blazing, we could see the HH3's tagging along in their wake.

2362
02:11:02.70 --> 02:11:08.70
I told Kovie to have the HH3 gun crews focus their fire on our southern perimeter and we'd handle the northern side.

2363
02:11:08.70 --> 02:11:16.70
I also requested they land as close as possible to the north slope and not pay any attention to the claimors' explosions we'd be setting off.

2364
02:11:16.70 --> 02:11:20.70
I didn't want to spook these guys off.

2365
02:11:20.70 --> 02:11:23.70
So the helos land.

2366
02:11:23.70 --> 02:11:33.70
Every one of the team once aboard immediately went to the starboard window or faced out the tailgate and began firing on full automatic as the HH3's revved up to full power.

2367
02:11:33.70 --> 02:11:38.70
I was the last to leave and before heading for the LZI set off the last claimor we'd put on the northern perimeter.

2368
02:11:38.70 --> 02:11:44.70
Then I ran like hell, bent over like a cripple and cursing the prop wash that was trying hard to push me backward.

2369
02:11:44.70 --> 02:11:55.70
As I made my dash I remember being surprised and not seeing a single dead body, although I passed a slew of blood trails and saw a lot of dark wet stains on the ground.

2370
02:11:55.70 --> 02:11:59.70
The second I was through the door, the HH3 lifted off the ground.

2371
02:11:59.70 --> 02:12:08.70
There was nothing but sporadic small arms fire coming at us and in the end the extraction was relatively calm one.

2372
02:12:08.70 --> 02:12:14.70
It seemed as if the enemy was disperated and just going through the motions.

2373
02:12:14.70 --> 02:12:18.70
I had a feeling they wanted us out of the AO as badly as we wanted to leave.

2374
02:12:18.70 --> 02:12:21.70
Nonetheless we all continued firing on full automatic.

2375
02:12:21.70 --> 02:12:26.70
We also launched at least one M79 round as we gained altitude.

2376
02:12:26.70 --> 02:12:29.70
I dropped my last hand grenade into the underbush.

2377
02:12:29.70 --> 02:12:32.70
A little something for someone I hoped.

2378
02:12:32.70 --> 02:12:36.70
Then just to suddenly and miraculously all gunfire ceased.

2379
02:12:36.70 --> 02:12:45.70
The only sound was that of the churning Sikorski HH3 engines and the increasingly cold air rushing through the aircraft.

2380
02:12:45.70 --> 02:12:52.70
I looked over my shoulder towards Sal, who was retrieving warm air force blankets for the long ride.

2381
02:12:52.70 --> 02:12:59.70
When I made contact with him, he gave me that quick nod of his and a slight smile.

2382
02:12:59.70 --> 02:13:02.70
We made it again.

2383
02:13:04.70 --> 02:13:07.70
That's just...

2384
02:13:07.70 --> 02:13:10.70
This is just an insane mission.

2385
02:13:10.70 --> 02:13:11.70
Oh yeah.

2386
02:13:11.70 --> 02:13:15.70
And I'm sure you know why don't you just break contact and continue mission.

2387
02:13:15.70 --> 02:13:22.70
So yeah, crazy.

2388
02:13:22.70 --> 02:13:23.70
They need to...

2389
02:13:23.70 --> 02:13:24.70
Yeah.

2390
02:13:24.70 --> 02:13:27.70
I know that you're putting some of these books on audio book.

2391
02:13:27.70 --> 02:13:33.70
But we're in the process of doing that and these are going to be great when you release those.

2392
02:13:33.70 --> 02:13:37.70
I know you talk about it in the little book you were putting for...

2393
02:13:37.70 --> 02:13:41.70
You requested one of your guys be putting it for a silver star for this operation.

2394
02:13:41.70 --> 02:13:48.70
It had John Engel and then you got put in for a silver star as well and actually...

2395
02:13:48.70 --> 02:13:52.70
The CEO said he was going to upgrade that.

2396
02:13:52.70 --> 02:13:54.70
Yeah, he said he's going to upgrade.

2397
02:13:54.70 --> 02:13:57.70
What's I didn't agree with but not going to argue either.

2398
02:13:57.70 --> 02:13:58.70
Yeah.

2399
02:13:58.70 --> 02:14:01.70
He did distinguish service cross which if you don't know what that is.

2400
02:14:01.70 --> 02:14:02.70
That's the...

2401
02:14:02.70 --> 02:14:06.70
The second highest military award for...

2402
02:14:06.70 --> 02:14:08.70
Valor.

2403
02:14:08.70 --> 02:14:13.70
And so... but at the same time and again this is...

2404
02:14:13.70 --> 02:14:15.70
I kind of have to just tie this back into the book a little bit.

2405
02:14:15.70 --> 02:14:20.70
But you would have been going through this kind of hassle with the commanding officer about carrying the...

2406
02:14:20.70 --> 02:14:22.70
...care in a new encryption device.

2407
02:14:22.70 --> 02:14:25.70
We didn't have it for that mission and you didn't have it for this one.

2408
02:14:25.70 --> 02:14:26.70
Correct.

2409
02:14:26.70 --> 02:14:29.70
But you had... but then it... he started turning up the heat like hey you got to carry this thing.

2410
02:14:29.70 --> 02:14:31.70
And this thing is no joke.

2411
02:14:31.70 --> 02:14:32.70
I mean I was looking at...

2412
02:14:32.70 --> 02:14:36.70
I used... even when I got to the sealed teams we used a PRC 77.

2413
02:14:36.70 --> 02:14:37.70
Were those around for you?

2414
02:14:37.70 --> 02:14:38.70
Yeah.

2415
02:14:38.70 --> 02:14:39.70
We started with it.

2416
02:14:39.70 --> 02:14:40.70
Okay.

2417
02:14:40.70 --> 02:14:42.70
For that encrypted transmission.

2418
02:14:42.70 --> 02:14:43.70
So there you go.

2419
02:14:43.70 --> 02:14:45.70
So the PRC 77 is an old radio.

2420
02:14:45.70 --> 02:14:46.70
It's an FM radio.

2421
02:14:46.70 --> 02:14:48.70
And it's... how big would I say it is?

2422
02:14:48.70 --> 02:14:49.70
What's something else?

2423
02:14:49.70 --> 02:14:51.70
It's similar to a trick 25.

2424
02:14:51.70 --> 02:14:52.70
Yeah.

2425
02:14:52.70 --> 02:14:55.70
But I'm trying to think of something that a civilian would know.

2426
02:14:55.70 --> 02:14:56.70
Can I have a... so I can describe it.

2427
02:14:56.70 --> 02:14:58.70
It's like a big... it's like two lunch boxes maybe?

2428
02:14:58.70 --> 02:14:59.70
Like yeah.

2429
02:14:59.70 --> 02:15:02.70
Maybe like a briefcase that's a little bit more square a little bit thicker.

2430
02:15:02.70 --> 02:15:03.70
So it's like that.

2431
02:15:03.70 --> 02:15:04.70
Maybe two shoe boxes.

2432
02:15:04.70 --> 02:15:05.70
Something like that.

2433
02:15:05.70 --> 02:15:06.70
Something like that.

2434
02:15:06.70 --> 02:15:08.70
That's how big a PRC 77 is.

2435
02:15:08.70 --> 02:15:13.70
The KY38, which is the encryption device, is basically the same size as that.

2436
02:15:13.70 --> 02:15:14.70
Right?

2437
02:15:14.70 --> 02:15:15.70
It's like again.

2438
02:15:15.70 --> 02:15:16.70
And it doubles the weight.

2439
02:15:16.70 --> 02:15:19.70
You've got to carry double the batteries.

2440
02:15:19.70 --> 02:15:26.70
It cuts down your range because it takes away from the penetration of the radio waves coming out.

2441
02:15:26.70 --> 02:15:30.70
And you had to carry the encryption punch.

2442
02:15:30.70 --> 02:15:31.70
Ugh.

2443
02:15:31.70 --> 02:15:34.70
So that's what you're getting told to carry.

2444
02:15:34.70 --> 02:15:37.70
And you keep coming back and saying, hey, this isn't that great.

2445
02:15:37.70 --> 02:15:39.70
Hey, we've been trying it.

2446
02:15:39.70 --> 02:15:44.70
It's not working.

2447
02:15:44.70 --> 02:15:46.70
You keep getting told.

2448
02:15:46.70 --> 02:15:47.70
No, carry it, carry it.

2449
02:15:47.70 --> 02:15:51.70
Finally, you say to your boss, you say the commanding officer, hey, look, I'll carry it.

2450
02:15:51.70 --> 02:15:55.70
But if we get in one of these bad situations, I'm going to destroy this thing.

2451
02:15:55.70 --> 02:15:58.70
If it doesn't work, I'm going to destroy this thing.

2452
02:15:58.70 --> 02:15:59.70
Yeah.

2453
02:15:59.70 --> 02:16:02.70
And he kind of says, okay, whatever, you know, but you carry it.

2454
02:16:02.70 --> 02:16:03.70
Yeah.

2455
02:16:03.70 --> 02:16:06.70
So you go on an operation.

2456
02:16:06.70 --> 02:16:09.70
And you actually, we're going to leave it in the hellows.

2457
02:16:09.70 --> 02:16:11.70
You ask the hellows to take it.

2458
02:16:11.70 --> 02:16:14.70
You ask him to come back and get it because it didn't work.

2459
02:16:14.70 --> 02:16:17.70
He said hellows come back and take this thing because it's 50 pounds.

2460
02:16:17.70 --> 02:16:18.70
Yes, the weight.

2461
02:16:18.70 --> 02:16:20.70
And we had, I wanted to try it.

2462
02:16:20.70 --> 02:16:22.70
The target was the ashore.

2463
02:16:22.70 --> 02:16:25.70
And there was, there was something specifically in the ashore.

2464
02:16:25.70 --> 02:16:27.70
They wanted us to confirm.

2465
02:16:27.70 --> 02:16:29.70
So I went in with a four man team.

2466
02:16:29.70 --> 02:16:31.70
The theory being, we're going light.

2467
02:16:31.70 --> 02:16:35.70
We can move quicker because the ashore valley didn't have triple canopy.

2468
02:16:35.70 --> 02:16:37.70
At least the part that we were looking at.

2469
02:16:37.70 --> 02:16:39.70
So they single or double canopy.

2470
02:16:39.70 --> 02:16:42.70
And a lot of open areas because it's been so many bombs.

2471
02:16:42.70 --> 02:16:45.70
There have been eight camps that had been overrun, deserted.

2472
02:16:45.70 --> 02:16:46.70
And I've been in the ashore.

2473
02:16:46.70 --> 02:16:49.70
We put the senses in and plus we fly over to every time.

2474
02:16:49.70 --> 02:16:52.70
So, generally from here where we were gone.

2475
02:16:52.70 --> 02:16:55.70
So I said, I want to do a four man team.

2476
02:16:55.70 --> 02:16:57.70
Please don't force me to carry it.

2477
02:16:57.70 --> 02:16:58.70
Well, we've had to carry it.

2478
02:16:58.70 --> 02:17:01.70
And that's when I said if it doesn't work, we went in and tried it.

2479
02:17:01.70 --> 02:17:02.70
Didn't work.

2480
02:17:02.70 --> 02:17:04.70
It's tried it a few times.

2481
02:17:04.70 --> 02:17:05.70
Yeah, and they wouldn't come back.

2482
02:17:05.70 --> 02:17:07.70
And you've been trying it on other operations as well.

2483
02:17:07.70 --> 02:17:10.70
We tried it on one and it's just a complete failure.

2484
02:17:10.70 --> 02:17:12.70
But I brought it back.

2485
02:17:12.70 --> 02:17:14.70
And so this time you start getting tracked.

2486
02:17:14.70 --> 02:17:15.70
Yeah.

2487
02:17:15.70 --> 02:17:17.70
And you say, okay, I'm not carrying this thing anymore.

2488
02:17:17.70 --> 02:17:18.70
So you put a thermo grenade.

2489
02:17:18.70 --> 02:17:19.70
You put a thermo grenade on it.

2490
02:17:19.70 --> 02:17:20.70
Yeah.

2491
02:17:20.70 --> 02:17:21.70
So you put a thermo grenade on it.

2492
02:17:21.70 --> 02:17:23.70
You destroy it.

2493
02:17:23.70 --> 02:17:27.70
And then you again, by the skin of your teeth,

2494
02:17:27.70 --> 02:17:30.70
you get you, you get you and your guys out of there.

2495
02:17:30.70 --> 02:17:35.70
And when you are coming back to your flying back to base.

2496
02:17:35.70 --> 02:17:37.70
And just so you know how close they were.

2497
02:17:37.70 --> 02:17:40.70
At one point, I'm looking to the north.

2498
02:17:40.70 --> 02:17:46.70
And I see a young face come through the jungle at me within two or three feet or so.

2499
02:17:46.70 --> 02:17:48.70
So I can see his outline.

2500
02:17:48.70 --> 02:17:50.70
I can see his AK is down.

2501
02:17:50.70 --> 02:17:52.70
He sees me.

2502
02:17:52.70 --> 02:17:55.70
And we just stop a look at each other.

2503
02:17:55.70 --> 02:17:57.70
And it's all through the jungle.

2504
02:17:57.70 --> 02:17:58.70
The grass.

2505
02:17:58.70 --> 02:17:59.70
He backed out.

2506
02:17:59.70 --> 02:18:01.70
I just kept my car at him.

2507
02:18:01.70 --> 02:18:03.70
But he didn't open fire.

2508
02:18:03.70 --> 02:18:04.70
And he was young.

2509
02:18:04.70 --> 02:18:06.70
I mean, a young kid with a gun.

2510
02:18:06.70 --> 02:18:07.70
He backed up.

2511
02:18:07.70 --> 02:18:08.70
And he went away.

2512
02:18:08.70 --> 02:18:11.70
So I knew that just, okay, this mission is now compromised.

2513
02:18:11.70 --> 02:18:13.70
And we hit the thermo.

2514
02:18:13.70 --> 02:18:14.70
Yeah.

2515
02:18:14.70 --> 02:18:19.70
Like I said, you get this is another mission where you are getting out of there by the skin of your teeth.

2516
02:18:19.70 --> 02:18:22.70
It's a damn miracle that you, you bring all your troops back.

2517
02:18:22.70 --> 02:18:25.70
That you don't get overrun that no one gets killed.

2518
02:18:25.70 --> 02:18:26.70
It's crazy.

2519
02:18:26.70 --> 02:18:29.70
And the CEO was flying in the helicopter close by.

2520
02:18:29.70 --> 02:18:30.70
We asked for a tactical.

2521
02:18:30.70 --> 02:18:31.70
The draw.

2522
02:18:31.70 --> 02:18:32.70
He goes.

2523
02:18:32.70 --> 02:18:33.70
Break contact.

2524
02:18:33.70 --> 02:18:35.70
The team is our favorite words.

2525
02:18:35.70 --> 02:18:39.70
So we destroyed the the the the the the encryption device.

2526
02:18:39.70 --> 02:18:40.70
Roger that.

2527
02:18:40.70 --> 02:18:41.70
Yeah.

2528
02:18:41.70 --> 02:18:42.70
Yeah.

2529
02:18:42.70 --> 02:18:43.70
And we had more contact.

2530
02:18:43.70 --> 02:18:45.70
Well, his he finally ran a fuel went back.

2531
02:18:45.70 --> 02:18:47.70
We're on the ground for a few more hours.

2532
02:18:47.70 --> 02:18:48.70
We get tamed to move.

2533
02:18:48.70 --> 02:18:50.70
But we hear more activity.

2534
02:18:50.70 --> 02:18:53.70
And we're going to be particularly at the third night at the damn radio.

2535
02:18:53.70 --> 02:18:54.70
I thought we'd be getting extracted.

2536
02:18:54.70 --> 02:18:55.70
He did.

2537
02:18:55.70 --> 02:18:59.70
So now they know where we are because anybody within 10 miles can tell.

2538
02:18:59.70 --> 02:19:03.70
There's the thermo grenade and he knows as those guys and they're coming for us.

2539
02:19:03.70 --> 02:19:04.70
But they want a lot.

2540
02:19:04.70 --> 02:19:09.70
But we had a new cubby rotted came out Dallas, Long Street.

2541
02:19:09.70 --> 02:19:12.70
And we started running A1s across me.

2542
02:19:12.70 --> 02:19:15.70
Could we hear the enemy to the west?

2543
02:19:15.70 --> 02:19:18.70
And so the A1s made a couple of gun runs.

2544
02:19:18.70 --> 02:19:20.70
And the last gun run.

2545
02:19:20.70 --> 02:19:23.70
The pilot came in and then he flipped his aircraft.

2546
02:19:23.70 --> 02:19:27.70
So like I'm looking at the A1 making a gun run.

2547
02:19:27.70 --> 02:19:32.70
And earlier you could hear him when they go buy you how the aircraft makes these noises.

2548
02:19:32.70 --> 02:19:37.70
These crack noises when the wings change and he whatever the structure is in the planar.

2549
02:19:37.70 --> 02:19:39.70
So I'd heard him go buy before this one.

2550
02:19:39.70 --> 02:19:42.70
He came by he want to make sure where we were.

2551
02:19:42.70 --> 02:19:43.70
He came by so close.

2552
02:19:43.70 --> 02:19:46.70
I could tell you he was smoking a filly suroute.

2553
02:19:46.70 --> 02:19:49.70
He looked over and nodded.

2554
02:19:49.70 --> 02:19:50.70
I saluted.

2555
02:19:50.70 --> 02:19:53.70
And he did a couple more gun runs and they brought in this and they they

2556
02:19:53.70 --> 02:19:54.70
It's a good land.

2557
02:19:54.70 --> 02:19:57.70
So they dropped the ropes and pulled us out on ropes.

2558
02:19:57.70 --> 02:20:01.70
And of course, maybe we got a ropes to shoot matches like target practice for them.

2559
02:20:01.70 --> 02:20:03.70
I don't know if we could shine on the ropes.

2560
02:20:03.70 --> 02:20:05.70
I mean, I don't know if we had a lot of guys in this show.

2561
02:20:05.70 --> 02:20:06.70
Never got shine on the ropes.

2562
02:20:06.70 --> 02:20:08.70
Not go with just just luck.

2563
02:20:08.70 --> 02:20:09.70
Oh, sure luck.

2564
02:20:09.70 --> 02:20:13.70
I mean, always felt like they're just coming through your legs to get your balls.

2565
02:20:13.70 --> 02:20:16.70
Or Mr. Happy.

2566
02:20:16.70 --> 02:20:19.70
Brain time somewhere about brain time.

2567
02:20:19.70 --> 02:20:25.70
So you go through all that.

2568
02:20:25.70 --> 02:20:33.70
And again, people need to buy this book so they can read that full story because even what you just said is a portion of it.

2569
02:20:33.70 --> 02:20:34.70
You get back.

2570
02:20:34.70 --> 02:20:38.70
You get taken out on strings, which again, that's something we didn't talk about a lot.

2571
02:20:38.70 --> 02:20:42.70
But a lot of times when helicopters couldn't land, they dropped down the ropes with the sandbags on the end.

2572
02:20:42.70 --> 02:20:46.70
And that's what they got to clip in and they drag you out through the jungle and get you up the altitude and get you out of there.

2573
02:20:46.70 --> 02:20:48.70
And that's what happens here.

2574
02:20:48.70 --> 02:20:52.70
Finally, you get back and here we're going back to the book.

2575
02:20:52.70 --> 02:20:57.70
When we landed on the helicopter pad at CC and the CO's biggest ramp, a rude, arrogant,

2576
02:20:57.70 --> 02:21:05.70
a rude, ignorant sergeant major told me to report to the CO, ASAP with the KY38 and all attachments for it.

2577
02:21:05.70 --> 02:21:11.70
When I walked into the CO's office, the ramp sergeant major ordered me to stand at attention, which I did.

2578
02:21:11.70 --> 02:21:16.70
Then the CO asked the $64,000 question, where is the KY38?

2579
02:21:16.70 --> 02:21:24.70
I explained to him that, per or earlier conversation, when we had made contact with the NVA since it didn't work, I destroyed it.

2580
02:21:24.70 --> 02:21:32.70
He flew into a rage telling me that I had violated a direct order from him not to destroy it under any circumstances.

2581
02:21:32.70 --> 02:21:35.70
I stated once again what I had said prior to the mission.

2582
02:21:35.70 --> 02:21:40.70
Because this was a foreman team, he simply said he didn't remember it that way.

2583
02:21:40.70 --> 02:21:48.70
It was just me, him, and the ramp sergeant major who knew that the CO was, of course, telling the truth.

2584
02:21:48.70 --> 02:21:52.70
So the sergeant major support and the skipper, of course.

2585
02:21:52.70 --> 02:21:53.70
Oh yeah.

2586
02:21:53.70 --> 02:21:55.70
He's telling the truth.

2587
02:21:55.70 --> 02:21:57.70
I didn't like the way this was going.

2588
02:21:57.70 --> 02:22:03.70
So, as I had in the past with the CO, I tried to explain my actions from the position of the man on the ground,

2589
02:22:03.70 --> 02:22:09.70
which was different from a man singing a command to control helicopter as he had earlier in the day while ordering me to break

2590
02:22:09.70 --> 02:22:12.70
contact and continue mission.

2591
02:22:12.70 --> 02:22:18.70
Then he got really pissed and told me that he was going to write me up from an article 32 criminal allegation

2592
02:22:18.70 --> 02:22:26.70
under the military code of conduct for willfully destroying US government property in direct opposition to his order,

2593
02:22:26.70 --> 02:22:30.70
not to destroy the KY38 under any circumstances.

2594
02:22:30.70 --> 02:22:34.70
The ramp sergeant major then whispered something to the CO.

2595
02:22:34.70 --> 02:22:42.70
As they whispered back and forth to each other, I found myself growing extremely calm, unbelievably calm.

2596
02:22:42.70 --> 02:22:47.70
Finally, the CO step from behind his desk, leaving the ramp sergeant major behind it.

2597
02:22:47.70 --> 02:22:50.70
I'm going to ruin your special forces career.

2598
02:22:50.70 --> 02:22:54.70
I want you out of CCN at first light tomorrow.

2599
02:22:54.70 --> 02:23:03.70
He went on to tell me to report to fifth special forces group headquarters in not trying where he'd have me drummed out of SF within the next month.

2600
02:23:03.70 --> 02:23:09.70
privately, I smiled because the CO hadn't done his homework.

2601
02:23:09.70 --> 02:23:21.70
He failed to realize that my service in the Army ended in two weeks due to the fact that I had extended my time in service to return to CCN.

2602
02:23:21.70 --> 02:23:32.70
The CO only knew the date when I had arrived at CCN and at assumed I had a traditional one year tour of duty that would end in October, not April 1970.

2603
02:23:32.70 --> 02:23:37.70
My song days ended right there.

2604
02:23:37.70 --> 02:23:47.70
I knew that when I went to Nautreng, I could get any assignment in Vietnam where there was an opening for an experienced SF soldier.

2605
02:23:47.70 --> 02:23:53.70
But as I stood there, I believe that God had sent this asshole into my life for a reason.

2606
02:23:53.70 --> 02:23:56.70
Granite, it wasn't a reason. I didn't completely understand.

2607
02:23:56.70 --> 02:24:01.70
Granite, it was a reason I didn't completely understand at this precise moment in time,

2608
02:24:01.70 --> 02:24:09.70
but maybe it was time for me to get out of Uncle Sam's Army altogether while my body, if not my mind, was relatively intact.

2609
02:24:09.70 --> 02:24:13.70
Who knew what the future held for SF in Vietnam?

2610
02:24:13.70 --> 02:24:18.70
Finally, he finished and asked me if I had anything to say.

2611
02:24:18.70 --> 02:24:22.70
Year of disgrace to West Point, fuck you, sir.

2612
02:24:22.70 --> 02:24:30.70
I turned an exited without saluting. The Remp Sergeant Major caught up to me as I exited the door and told me to return and salute the CO.

2613
02:24:30.70 --> 02:24:37.70
I bent toward his ear and quietly said, fuck you to Sergeant Major.

2614
02:24:37.70 --> 02:24:47.70
Before leaving the CCN headquarters area, I stopped by the awards and decoration desk to see if the CO had begun paperwork for flying that day east of our team.

2615
02:24:47.70 --> 02:24:59.70
Embarrassed that clerk simply nodded his head in the affirmative, meaning that the CO was in the process of getting himself written up for an award for telling us to break contact and continue.

2616
02:24:59.70 --> 02:25:07.70
While he was flying out of harm's way, safely in South Vietnam.

2617
02:25:07.70 --> 02:25:12.70
That was him.

2618
02:25:12.70 --> 02:25:14.70
Wow.

2619
02:25:14.70 --> 02:25:17.70
Oh yeah. Just don't believe it.

2620
02:25:17.70 --> 02:25:21.70
But you knew it. I just felt it.

2621
02:25:21.70 --> 02:25:28.70
And Pussy had a reputation already, but at that time, and we had talked to the A&D people previously about some other things he put himself in for.

2622
02:25:28.70 --> 02:25:31.70
And for a had somebody put him in for.

2623
02:25:31.70 --> 02:25:34.70
And yeah, so just a total of the scrapes.

2624
02:25:34.70 --> 02:25:39.70
And it's just the luck of the timing. Was the fact that you knew that you could get out of the army?

2625
02:25:39.70 --> 02:25:50.70
Yeah, because at that point I was juggling the thought of real listing, a friend of mine who was a captain who we had run one mission together.

2626
02:25:50.70 --> 02:25:55.70
He was going to use a process of putting me in for a direct commission to Lieutenant.

2627
02:25:55.70 --> 02:25:59.70
And sort of paperwork had been placed.

2628
02:25:59.70 --> 02:26:01.70
And I don't know if it ever got the site on or not.

2629
02:26:01.70 --> 02:26:03.70
But I know that he had a separate office.

2630
02:26:03.70 --> 02:26:09.70
The paperwork was done. We completed everything. We had letters of recommendation on that stuff.

2631
02:26:09.70 --> 02:26:13.70
And so in fact, he and I talked about what we're going to do.

2632
02:26:13.70 --> 02:26:19.70
I was going to stand for a few months to see if the direct commission, even though the reductions in force were coming.

2633
02:26:19.70 --> 02:26:27.70
You know, because they had already started the Vietnameseization process. The maximum amount power we had at Vietnam was at the end of 69.

2634
02:26:27.70 --> 02:26:32.70
I believe it was we had 543,000 Americans in Vietnam.

2635
02:26:32.70 --> 02:26:37.70
So by April 70, when this all happened, we had reduced the numbers.

2636
02:26:37.70 --> 02:26:41.70
You could do more, more was coming even within SF.

2637
02:26:41.70 --> 02:26:44.70
And so all those things were being juggled.

2638
02:26:44.70 --> 02:26:48.70
So if I got the direct commission, I thought about that two years of college.

2639
02:26:48.70 --> 02:26:52.70
I knew I had to get two more years of college going to try for a career.

2640
02:26:52.70 --> 02:26:56.70
And I didn't want to go back to four devins.

2641
02:26:56.70 --> 02:27:00.70
So those were the things I was jumping at the time.

2642
02:27:00.70 --> 02:27:04.70
And when this all happened, I just like I said, I was really conscious.

2643
02:27:04.70 --> 02:27:06.70
I thought God gave me an answer here.

2644
02:27:06.70 --> 02:27:08.70
Yep.

2645
02:27:08.70 --> 02:27:22.70
Going back to the book, I continued down to the team room where I gave $500 to buy food and drink for the biggest party RT Idaho had during my tenure on the team.

2646
02:27:22.70 --> 02:27:24.70
We partyed late into the night.

2647
02:27:24.70 --> 02:27:32.70
One by one, each team member passed out until it was just hept and me standing outside RT Idaho's Vietnamese team room.

2648
02:27:32.70 --> 02:27:40.70
Hept asked me if I needed him for any more interpreting. When I said no, he passed out in the sand.

2649
02:27:40.70 --> 02:27:48.70
I picked him up, dust him off, as best I could, and carried him into the team room where I gently placed him in bed.

2650
02:27:48.70 --> 02:27:55.70
Before I turned the lights out, I stood in the doorway for a moment longer, reflecting on my 18 months with these men,

2651
02:27:55.70 --> 02:28:01.70
with a special affection and admiration for Sal, Hept, Falc, Kwang, and Hong.

2652
02:28:01.70 --> 02:28:09.70
Then the guilt pangs washed over me, what did the future hold for them?

2653
02:28:09.70 --> 02:28:13.70
And that had to be the hardest part of this departure.

2654
02:28:13.70 --> 02:28:16.70
Brutal, really was.

2655
02:28:16.70 --> 02:28:22.70
And these guys were just doing this continually for years.

2656
02:28:22.70 --> 02:28:24.70
They didn't rotate out.

2657
02:28:24.70 --> 02:28:25.70
No, that was their job.

2658
02:28:25.70 --> 02:28:27.70
Well, Hept had rotated up to headquarters.

2659
02:28:27.70 --> 02:28:31.70
He asked for permission to go there for a better paying job.

2660
02:28:31.70 --> 02:28:35.70
And at the 3.5 years of run, the recon said, sure.

2661
02:28:35.70 --> 02:28:38.70
And we had the guy who was interpreter of Virginia came over.

2662
02:28:38.70 --> 02:28:41.70
Not as good as he had, but he was a good interpreter.

2663
02:28:41.70 --> 02:28:45.70
And by that time, we had worked on two other South Vietnamese in the D'Hung,

2664
02:28:45.70 --> 02:28:50.70
and a child, we're speaking good enough English, where if I got shot,

2665
02:28:50.70 --> 02:28:53.70
they could pick up the radio and take over.

2666
02:28:53.70 --> 02:28:59.70
Because we cross-trained them on radio procedures, SOPs, how to run everything.

2667
02:28:59.70 --> 02:29:03.70
So, he had to do it that hung and then child later.

2668
02:29:03.70 --> 02:29:07.70
And they must, from their perspective, this must have seemed completely insane.

2669
02:29:07.70 --> 02:29:08.70
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

2670
02:29:08.70 --> 02:29:10.70
And they were like, really?

2671
02:29:10.70 --> 02:29:13.70
But they knew the way, but this is 70.

2672
02:29:13.70 --> 02:29:16.70
So, SF had been there in 4 years, for 6 years by then.

2673
02:29:16.70 --> 02:29:19.70
And they had knew enough and talking to each other,

2674
02:29:19.70 --> 02:29:23.70
being in the secret war, how things were operated,

2675
02:29:23.70 --> 02:29:27.70
and that we all reported to a commander somewhere.

2676
02:29:27.70 --> 02:29:32.70
And it was still one of the points that's a sticking point,

2677
02:29:32.70 --> 02:29:34.70
it was like, oh, God, I'm alive.

2678
02:29:34.70 --> 02:29:37.70
Thanks to you and now I'm leaving you guys here.

2679
02:29:37.70 --> 02:29:41.70
And so this is April 70, without everything,

2680
02:29:41.70 --> 02:29:45.70
about what April 30, 1975 would be like,

2681
02:29:45.70 --> 02:29:50.70
the day it's so I got on film, just horrible.

2682
02:29:50.70 --> 02:29:55.70
So, you finished with that, you pack up,

2683
02:29:55.70 --> 02:30:00.70
you reported to not train during the next two weeks,

2684
02:30:00.70 --> 02:30:03.70
the most traumatic event was having the ice cream stance,

2685
02:30:03.70 --> 02:30:05.70
a really damaged bite, enemy mortifier.

2686
02:30:05.70 --> 02:30:06.70
That was serious.

2687
02:30:06.70 --> 02:30:10.70
That's really messing with your head, destroyed ice cream stance.

2688
02:30:10.70 --> 02:30:16.70
The rumps we had to go got they got PTSD from that one.

2689
02:30:16.70 --> 02:30:18.70
Oh, you had a good day on town for the ice cream.

2690
02:30:18.70 --> 02:30:25.70
On April 25th, that was April 1st,

2691
02:30:25.70 --> 02:30:26.70
and now it's April 25th.

2692
02:30:26.70 --> 02:30:27.70
Yeah.

2693
02:30:27.70 --> 02:30:30.70
I'm mustard out of the army at Fort Lewis, Washington.

2694
02:30:30.70 --> 02:30:32.70
Again, with mixed emotions, I flew to Denver,

2695
02:30:32.70 --> 02:30:35.70
Colorado, to spend a few days with my sister, Linda,

2696
02:30:35.70 --> 02:30:38.70
and to enjoy some spring skiing in the Rockies.

2697
02:30:38.70 --> 02:30:40.70
At the end of April, she got a rental car from me

2698
02:30:40.70 --> 02:30:41.70
to return to New York City.

2699
02:30:41.70 --> 02:30:44.70
I drove from Denver to Southern Lindo,

2700
02:30:44.70 --> 02:30:46.70
hired a visit, my cousin, Dung, Conrad,

2701
02:30:46.70 --> 02:30:49.70
and his wife, Sandra, before heading home to Trenton.

2702
02:30:49.70 --> 02:30:52.70
The drive was about 1,300 miles,

2703
02:30:52.70 --> 02:30:56.70
including pit stops and a long wait, no hire for food and few phone calls.

2704
02:30:56.70 --> 02:30:58.70
I made it home in less than 15 hours.

2705
02:30:58.70 --> 02:31:03.70
See, your average in over 100 miles an hour, basically.

2706
02:31:03.70 --> 02:31:06.70
That's all I could do though, it's just a rental.

2707
02:31:06.70 --> 02:31:12.70
When I arrived at 20 West Paul Ave, that's your house.

2708
02:31:12.70 --> 02:31:15.70
Where you grew up, it was around 3am.

2709
02:31:15.70 --> 02:31:17.70
Times had changed in my absence.

2710
02:31:17.70 --> 02:31:20.70
My parents now walked the front and back doors of the house.

2711
02:31:20.70 --> 02:31:22.70
So, when I jumped boots and class aged,

2712
02:31:22.70 --> 02:31:25.70
uniform, I went around to the back of the house,

2713
02:31:25.70 --> 02:31:27.70
where I climbed up to the window.

2714
02:31:27.70 --> 02:31:31.70
Grab the metal roof of the shed,

2715
02:31:31.70 --> 02:31:34.70
and step on the metal closed line hook

2716
02:31:34.70 --> 02:31:38.70
to push myself up to the red metal roof dampened

2717
02:31:38.70 --> 02:31:40.70
by the morning moisture.

2718
02:31:40.70 --> 02:31:43.70
After I climbed through the back window,

2719
02:31:43.70 --> 02:31:45.70
I went over to my little brother,

2720
02:31:45.70 --> 02:31:47.70
David, and gave him a big hug.

2721
02:31:47.70 --> 02:31:49.70
Hell, he was taller than me.

2722
02:31:49.70 --> 02:31:52.70
Then I went down to my parents' bedroom,

2723
02:31:52.70 --> 02:31:54.70
moving first to my mother's side of the bed.

2724
02:31:54.70 --> 02:31:57.70
I touched her face, but didn't say a word.

2725
02:31:57.70 --> 02:32:00.70
Grogi, she murmured,

2726
02:32:00.70 --> 02:32:02.70
David, is that you?

2727
02:32:02.70 --> 02:32:06.70
Then she reached up to my face and felt my beard.

2728
02:32:06.70 --> 02:32:08.70
John, she said,

2729
02:32:08.70 --> 02:32:10.70
as she stirred from her sleep,

2730
02:32:10.70 --> 02:32:11.70
John, is that you?

2731
02:32:11.70 --> 02:32:13.70
John, your home?

2732
02:32:13.70 --> 02:32:16.70
Henry, it's John, he's home.

2733
02:32:16.70 --> 02:32:18.70
She reached around my neck,

2734
02:32:18.70 --> 02:32:22.70
with the urgency and pain only mothers know.

2735
02:32:22.70 --> 02:32:23.70
And said,

2736
02:32:23.70 --> 02:32:25.70
Johnny's home.

2737
02:32:25.70 --> 02:32:32.70
Oh, yeah.

2738
02:32:32.70 --> 02:32:35.70
So, you made it home?

2739
02:32:35.70 --> 02:32:38.70
Oh, my body grace, God.

2740
02:32:38.70 --> 02:32:40.70
And what came next?

2741
02:32:40.70 --> 02:32:43.70
What did you do after that?

2742
02:32:43.70 --> 02:32:47.70
So, you made it home?

2743
02:32:47.70 --> 02:32:50.70
Oh, my body grace, God.

2744
02:32:50.70 --> 02:32:52.70
And what came next?

2745
02:32:52.70 --> 02:32:55.70
What did you do after that?

2746
02:32:55.70 --> 02:33:00.70
Well, went back to school,

2747
02:33:00.70 --> 02:33:02.70
because it took me two years to flunk out.

2748
02:33:02.70 --> 02:33:05.70
So, that summer,

2749
02:33:05.70 --> 02:33:07.70
I took classes,

2750
02:33:07.70 --> 02:33:09.70
and then my dad got me a job right away,

2751
02:33:09.70 --> 02:33:11.70
drive to school buses.

2752
02:33:11.70 --> 02:33:13.70
And so, within the first two, three days

2753
02:33:13.70 --> 02:33:15.70
of me getting a driver's license,

2754
02:33:15.70 --> 02:33:16.70
this is Trenton, New Jersey.

2755
02:33:16.70 --> 02:33:19.70
There are still some race rides that we're going on.

2756
02:33:19.70 --> 02:33:22.70
So, things they had, curfews,

2757
02:33:22.70 --> 02:33:24.70
which is like, this is like mind-boggling,

2758
02:33:24.70 --> 02:33:26.70
in Trenton, in ball places.

2759
02:33:26.70 --> 02:33:28.70
And so, they said,

2760
02:33:28.70 --> 02:33:29.70
we got to run for you.

2761
02:33:29.70 --> 02:33:31.70
You're going to go to Chambersburg,

2762
02:33:31.70 --> 02:33:34.70
which was the Italian section of Trenton,

2763
02:33:34.70 --> 02:33:37.70
and they were just starting new integration program.

2764
02:33:37.70 --> 02:33:41.70
So, I picked up a busload of young black kids

2765
02:33:41.70 --> 02:33:44.70
that were mostly elementary school.

2766
02:33:44.70 --> 02:33:46.70
Pick them up,

2767
02:33:46.70 --> 02:33:49.70
take them in the Chambersburg, on the way in, there's protests,

2768
02:33:49.70 --> 02:33:51.70
and I'm getting rocked and stoned.

2769
02:33:51.70 --> 02:33:54.70
And I don't have my car 15.

2770
02:33:54.70 --> 02:33:56.70
Because those Italians are whoever they were,

2771
02:33:56.70 --> 02:33:58.70
they were hitting us with those rocks.

2772
02:33:58.70 --> 02:34:00.70
It was really, make me very unhappy.

2773
02:34:00.70 --> 02:34:02.70
But here it was like,

2774
02:34:02.70 --> 02:34:04.70
this is Trenton, I go for one more zone to this,

2775
02:34:04.70 --> 02:34:07.70
and they're doing this in a great-n-stall.

2776
02:34:07.70 --> 02:34:09.70
And so, the curfews,

2777
02:34:09.70 --> 02:34:10.70
so we had all that going on,

2778
02:34:10.70 --> 02:34:11.70
and within a couple weeks,

2779
02:34:11.70 --> 02:34:13.70
the church sawpball team was reactivated,

2780
02:34:13.70 --> 02:34:15.70
sawpball season was there.

2781
02:34:15.70 --> 02:34:17.70
So did that school,

2782
02:34:17.70 --> 02:34:19.70
disinteriving?

2783
02:34:19.70 --> 02:34:22.70
And that's the gut involved in the school newspaper,

2784
02:34:22.70 --> 02:34:24.70
became editor.

2785
02:34:24.70 --> 02:34:27.70
We had a period of time where the student government

2786
02:34:27.70 --> 02:34:29.70
voted itself out of office.

2787
02:34:29.70 --> 02:34:31.70
We had the SDS on campus, the communist,

2788
02:34:31.70 --> 02:34:33.70
we're doing a thing behind the scenes.

2789
02:34:33.70 --> 02:34:35.70
They burnt down a couple buildings,

2790
02:34:35.70 --> 02:34:36.70
just for good luck.

2791
02:34:36.70 --> 02:34:38.70
Played Domino's in a library,

2792
02:34:38.70 --> 02:34:40.70
knocked over all the books there.

2793
02:34:40.70 --> 02:34:42.70
Stupid stuff.

2794
02:34:42.70 --> 02:34:45.70
And you had to just be thinking yourself.

2795
02:34:45.70 --> 02:34:46.70
Are you serious?

2796
02:34:46.70 --> 02:34:47.70
Yeah.

2797
02:34:47.70 --> 02:34:49.70
This is what I just,

2798
02:34:49.70 --> 02:34:51.70
you know, sawed my friends get killed,

2799
02:34:51.70 --> 02:34:53.70
took risk my own life,

2800
02:34:53.70 --> 02:34:56.70
saw what the Vietnamese people were actually fighting for,

2801
02:34:56.70 --> 02:34:57.70
what they wanted.

2802
02:34:57.70 --> 02:34:58.70
Yeah.

2803
02:34:58.70 --> 02:34:59.70
And you had these people back here in America,

2804
02:34:59.70 --> 02:35:01.70
do it acting like this.

2805
02:35:01.70 --> 02:35:02.70
And the student,

2806
02:35:02.70 --> 02:35:05.70
we knew the SDS were back with the communist,

2807
02:35:05.70 --> 02:35:07.70
and they had their older propaganda,

2808
02:35:07.70 --> 02:35:09.70
but it was never reported.

2809
02:35:09.70 --> 02:35:10.70
They were just like,

2810
02:35:10.70 --> 02:35:12.70
another group protesting in the streets,

2811
02:35:12.70 --> 02:35:16.70
without any kind of active deafness,

2812
02:35:16.70 --> 02:35:18.70
the hoodies people really wore,

2813
02:35:18.70 --> 02:35:20.70
what they really hated America.

2814
02:35:20.70 --> 02:35:22.70
And so,

2815
02:35:22.70 --> 02:35:25.70
we're involved with school trying to get going,

2816
02:35:25.70 --> 02:35:28.70
and during this time,

2817
02:35:28.70 --> 02:35:31.70
we got very active with the paper.

2818
02:35:31.70 --> 02:35:32.70
I was editor for two years.

2819
02:35:32.70 --> 02:35:34.70
I worked on the paper for every day,

2820
02:35:34.70 --> 02:35:36.70
for two straight years.

2821
02:35:36.70 --> 02:35:38.70
And we had our moments,

2822
02:35:38.70 --> 02:35:39.70
you know,

2823
02:35:39.70 --> 02:35:42.70
they had the first faculty strike in the state.

2824
02:35:42.70 --> 02:35:43.70
So before that,

2825
02:35:43.70 --> 02:35:44.70
I was really excited.

2826
02:35:44.70 --> 02:35:46.70
Could me and two other SF buddies,

2827
02:35:46.70 --> 02:35:48.70
we're going to shut the campus down.

2828
02:35:48.70 --> 02:35:50.70
Could the faculty there,

2829
02:35:50.70 --> 02:35:51.70
and the teacher, you know,

2830
02:35:51.70 --> 02:35:52.70
told us,

2831
02:35:52.70 --> 02:35:54.70
we will support you students,

2832
02:35:54.70 --> 02:35:56.70
and we're going to get things for you,

2833
02:35:56.70 --> 02:35:57.70
and they meet other promises,

2834
02:35:57.70 --> 02:35:58.70
which,

2835
02:35:58.70 --> 02:35:59.70
okay,

2836
02:35:59.70 --> 02:36:00.70
I'm all for it.

2837
02:36:00.70 --> 02:36:04.70
And it'd be the first strike in history in New Jersey.

2838
02:36:04.70 --> 02:36:05.70
And so,

2839
02:36:05.70 --> 02:36:06.70
me and the guys put together a plan,

2840
02:36:06.70 --> 02:36:08.70
because there's basically three major entrances,

2841
02:36:08.70 --> 02:36:11.70
and one couple of planned-est-time routes.

2842
02:36:11.70 --> 02:36:12.70
So,

2843
02:36:12.70 --> 02:36:13.70
we had everything planned.

2844
02:36:13.70 --> 02:36:15.70
We're going to overturn an empty fuel tank,

2845
02:36:15.70 --> 02:36:16.70
or at one gate,

2846
02:36:16.70 --> 02:36:17.70
the other gate.

2847
02:36:17.70 --> 02:36:19.70
We were going to just close it down with cars,

2848
02:36:19.70 --> 02:36:20.70
and things.

2849
02:36:20.70 --> 02:36:21.70
So we take them,

2850
02:36:21.70 --> 02:36:22.70
at least a day or two,

2851
02:36:22.70 --> 02:36:24.70
to clean it up and clear it out.

2852
02:36:24.70 --> 02:36:26.70
We shut that school down.

2853
02:36:26.70 --> 02:36:27.70
So,

2854
02:36:27.70 --> 02:36:29.70
we're part of our plans together, right?

2855
02:36:29.70 --> 02:36:31.70
So now here comes Mr. Editor.

2856
02:36:31.70 --> 02:36:33.70
I get a copy of

2857
02:36:33.70 --> 02:36:34.70
the state.

2858
02:36:34.70 --> 02:36:37.70
I go to the state, the part of a higher education,

2859
02:36:37.70 --> 02:36:41.70
and the chancellor gives me what the state is proposing.

2860
02:36:41.70 --> 02:36:42.70
So, look at this.

2861
02:36:42.70 --> 02:36:43.70
Read this.

2862
02:36:43.70 --> 02:36:44.70
It says,

2863
02:36:44.70 --> 02:36:46.70
have the union give you their proposals,

2864
02:36:46.70 --> 02:36:47.70
but they wouldn't give it to me.

2865
02:36:47.70 --> 02:36:48.70
Nor would the chancellor,

2866
02:36:48.70 --> 02:36:51.70
he felt it was a violation of their fiduciary,

2867
02:36:51.70 --> 02:36:54.70
whatever the hell it was that they're dealing with these

2868
02:36:54.70 --> 02:36:55.70
union people.

2869
02:36:55.70 --> 02:36:56.70
So,

2870
02:36:56.70 --> 02:36:59.70
the union guy had his Volkswagen in the parking lot.

2871
02:36:59.70 --> 02:37:00.70
Long story short,

2872
02:37:00.70 --> 02:37:02.70
I borrowed his contract.

2873
02:37:02.70 --> 02:37:04.70
I got it photocopied.

2874
02:37:04.70 --> 02:37:07.70
I want photocopied me downstairs at the administration building.

2875
02:37:07.70 --> 02:37:08.70
He walked by,

2876
02:37:08.70 --> 02:37:10.70
I salute, say hi,

2877
02:37:10.70 --> 02:37:14.70
continue to photocopied his negotiating paper,

2878
02:37:14.70 --> 02:37:16.70
which is many pages long.

2879
02:37:16.70 --> 02:37:18.70
I went back in print,

2880
02:37:18.70 --> 02:37:19.70
and was side by side.

2881
02:37:19.70 --> 02:37:22.70
There's two mentions of what the union was going to do

2882
02:37:22.70 --> 02:37:24.70
and over 20 or 30 pages of documents.

2883
02:37:24.70 --> 02:37:27.70
One was to give them more time off

2884
02:37:27.70 --> 02:37:30.70
and the other was for class size.

2885
02:37:30.70 --> 02:37:32.70
That's all they had in those pages.

2886
02:37:32.70 --> 02:37:33.70
We printed it,

2887
02:37:33.70 --> 02:37:35.70
dead in editorial,

2888
02:37:35.70 --> 02:37:37.70
and said screw the union.

2889
02:37:37.70 --> 02:37:38.70
And I posted it,

2890
02:37:38.70 --> 02:37:40.70
and we went to war with the union editor,

2891
02:37:40.70 --> 02:37:42.70
and it's a finaire.

2892
02:37:42.70 --> 02:37:44.70
And they went on strike,

2893
02:37:44.70 --> 02:37:46.70
but they didn't close the campus down.

2894
02:37:46.70 --> 02:37:48.70
I pulled our true eyes broken heart,

2895
02:37:48.70 --> 02:37:48.70
man.

2896
02:37:48.70 --> 02:37:50.70
I really wanted to get some

2897
02:37:50.70 --> 02:37:53.70
good-a-ville of warfare here at Trenton State College,

2898
02:37:53.70 --> 02:37:54.70
you know.

2899
02:37:54.70 --> 02:37:56.70
But they lied to us.

2900
02:37:56.70 --> 02:37:58.70
What were you studying at the time?

2901
02:37:58.70 --> 02:38:00.70
Well, you know,

2902
02:38:00.70 --> 02:38:02.70
I was at Barbrao's at Freshman in 64,

2903
02:38:02.70 --> 02:38:05.70
and I finally graduated in 74 with a political science degree,

2904
02:38:05.70 --> 02:38:07.70
and he was a minor in English.

2905
02:38:07.70 --> 02:38:08.70
The thing was,

2906
02:38:08.70 --> 02:38:10.70
I was still in my foreign language at the time.

2907
02:38:10.70 --> 02:38:11.70
And did you,

2908
02:38:11.70 --> 02:38:12.70
I know you were working at the paper,

2909
02:38:12.70 --> 02:38:13.70
again,

2910
02:38:13.70 --> 02:38:15.70
that's what you ended up doing for your career.

2911
02:38:15.70 --> 02:38:16.70
You're a career.

2912
02:38:16.70 --> 02:38:16.70
You're a career.

2913
02:38:16.70 --> 02:38:18.70
You must have my amazement.

2914
02:38:18.70 --> 02:38:20.70
Because at the signal,

2915
02:38:20.70 --> 02:38:21.70
that was our school paper.

2916
02:38:21.70 --> 02:38:22.70
I did everything,

2917
02:38:22.70 --> 02:38:23.70
photography,

2918
02:38:23.70 --> 02:38:24.70
edit tutorials,

2919
02:38:24.70 --> 02:38:25.70
news stories,

2920
02:38:25.70 --> 02:38:27.70
and went down to the Trenton Times,

2921
02:38:27.70 --> 02:38:28.70
a local paper.

2922
02:38:28.70 --> 02:38:30.70
They were owned by the Washington Post.

2923
02:38:30.70 --> 02:38:32.70
Dick Harwood was the editor,

2924
02:38:32.70 --> 02:38:34.70
and during the Watergate stuff,

2925
02:38:34.70 --> 02:38:37.70
he was the voice that was skeptical of Woodward and Bernstein.

2926
02:38:37.70 --> 02:38:39.70
But he was my editor.

2927
02:38:39.70 --> 02:38:40.70
So I go down,

2928
02:38:40.70 --> 02:38:42.70
and I went in for an interview.

2929
02:38:42.70 --> 02:38:43.70
I said,

2930
02:38:43.70 --> 02:38:44.70
my hair is on my shoulders.

2931
02:38:44.70 --> 02:38:46.70
Now I hadn't had a haircut for a couple of years.

2932
02:38:46.70 --> 02:38:48.70
Blue Jean jacket,

2933
02:38:48.70 --> 02:38:49.70
T-shirt,

2934
02:38:49.70 --> 02:38:50.70
jungle boots,

2935
02:38:50.70 --> 02:38:51.70
old blue jeans,

2936
02:38:51.70 --> 02:38:52.70
going for the first interview.

2937
02:38:52.70 --> 02:38:53.70
He's interested.

2938
02:38:53.70 --> 02:38:54.70
It's just come back for a second.

2939
02:38:54.70 --> 02:38:56.70
I went back for a second interview,

2940
02:38:56.70 --> 02:38:57.70
and he said,

2941
02:38:57.70 --> 02:38:58.70
I went to the studio,

2942
02:38:58.70 --> 02:38:59.70
had a clean t-shirt this time.

2943
02:38:59.70 --> 02:39:00.70
Step it up.

2944
02:39:00.70 --> 02:39:01.70
Yeah.

2945
02:39:01.70 --> 02:39:04.70
I even thought about passing the jungle boots,

2946
02:39:04.70 --> 02:39:05.70
but I said,

2947
02:39:05.70 --> 02:39:06.70
nah.

2948
02:39:06.70 --> 02:39:07.70
So I got hired.

2949
02:39:07.70 --> 02:39:08.70
Went to work to Trenton Times.

2950
02:39:08.70 --> 02:39:10.70
I was there for 10 years.

2951
02:39:10.70 --> 02:39:13.70
And then went to San Diego for 10,

2952
02:39:13.70 --> 02:39:14.70
10 years.

2953
02:39:14.70 --> 02:39:16.70
Woodard, San Diego,

2954
02:39:16.70 --> 02:39:16.70
you know,

2955
02:39:16.70 --> 02:39:17.70
which is about eight years.

2956
02:39:17.70 --> 02:39:18.70
Moodyite,

2957
02:39:18.70 --> 02:39:18.70
California,

2958
02:39:18.70 --> 02:39:20.70
1985.

2959
02:39:20.70 --> 02:39:21.70
What major decided to move on to California?

2960
02:39:21.70 --> 02:39:23.70
The Washington Post sold to Trenton Times,

2961
02:39:23.70 --> 02:39:24.70
and it,

2962
02:39:24.70 --> 02:39:25.70
the quality of the newspaper,

2963
02:39:25.70 --> 02:39:27.70
just diminished incredibly.

2964
02:39:27.70 --> 02:39:29.70
I was fighting more with the editors

2965
02:39:29.70 --> 02:39:31.70
to get stories into the paper.

2966
02:39:31.70 --> 02:39:33.70
I got a couple of courts.

2967
02:39:33.70 --> 02:39:35.70
And I was doing investigative stuff.

2968
02:39:35.70 --> 02:39:36.70
We did a story about the,

2969
02:39:36.70 --> 02:39:39.70
we broke the story about the FBI

2970
02:39:39.70 --> 02:39:42.70
investigating Philadelphia police department

2971
02:39:42.70 --> 02:39:44.70
corruption that went to the top.

2972
02:39:44.70 --> 02:39:48.70
Why it interviewed a marine who was a Vietnam vet,

2973
02:39:48.70 --> 02:39:52.70
who was the undercover guy working with the fan-belt inspectors

2974
02:39:52.70 --> 02:39:54.70
for 18 months.

2975
02:39:54.70 --> 02:39:56.70
I see this guy at Nays.

2976
02:39:56.70 --> 02:39:57.70
We did this today.

2977
02:39:57.70 --> 02:39:58.70
We did this.

2978
02:39:58.70 --> 02:40:00.70
He made fun of the FBI.

2979
02:40:00.70 --> 02:40:02.70
And so he told me when they're getting ready to,

2980
02:40:02.70 --> 02:40:03.70
to go out,

2981
02:40:03.70 --> 02:40:05.70
get the search warrant and do the rates.

2982
02:40:05.70 --> 02:40:07.70
I called up the fan-belt inspectors and said,

2983
02:40:07.70 --> 02:40:07.70
hey,

2984
02:40:07.70 --> 02:40:09.70
I heard you got a little case going on.

2985
02:40:09.70 --> 02:40:12.70
I don't want to jeopardize your investigation,

2986
02:40:12.70 --> 02:40:15.70
but I'm going to write about it before you guys do it.

2987
02:40:15.70 --> 02:40:16.70
Let's talk.

2988
02:40:16.70 --> 02:40:19.70
Turns out the chief FBI guy was a,

2989
02:40:19.70 --> 02:40:20.70
a,

2990
02:40:20.70 --> 02:40:20.70
a,

2991
02:40:20.70 --> 02:40:21.70
a specter pilot.

2992
02:40:21.70 --> 02:40:22.70
Oh, Jesus.

2993
02:40:22.70 --> 02:40:23.70
He had flown in layoffs.

2994
02:40:23.70 --> 02:40:26.70
Now we couldn't determine if he was my savior that night.

2995
02:40:26.70 --> 02:40:28.70
On February,

2996
02:40:28.70 --> 02:40:29.70
in 1970 or not,

2997
02:40:29.70 --> 02:40:31.70
but we had an interesting exchange.

2998
02:40:31.70 --> 02:40:34.70
So I gave him two days.

2999
02:40:34.70 --> 02:40:36.70
And they put all the paperwork together.

3000
02:40:36.70 --> 02:40:39.70
And they put up wire taps on the key suspects.

3001
02:40:39.70 --> 02:40:41.70
And the Philadelphia Police Department,

3002
02:40:41.70 --> 02:40:42.70
Monday morning,

3003
02:40:42.70 --> 02:40:43.70
I broke the story.

3004
02:40:43.70 --> 02:40:46.70
Scoop the Philadelphia inquiry every major paper in the world.

3005
02:40:46.70 --> 02:40:48.70
This is before the communist news network

3006
02:40:48.70 --> 02:40:50.70
and Fox News notice.

3007
02:40:50.70 --> 02:40:52.70
Did the story?

3008
02:40:52.70 --> 02:40:55.70
And it was amazing.

3009
02:40:55.70 --> 02:40:57.70
And they did the whole thing on the follow-up.

3010
02:40:57.70 --> 02:41:00.70
So I was my one of my major crews.

3011
02:41:00.70 --> 02:41:02.70
We had the other story about the Philadelphia

3012
02:41:02.70 --> 02:41:04.70
Phillies that were under investigation.

3013
02:41:04.70 --> 02:41:06.70
And so I had law enforcement.

3014
02:41:06.70 --> 02:41:07.70
It was my,

3015
02:41:07.70 --> 02:41:09.70
was my main source that I did the courts and in between.

3016
02:41:09.70 --> 02:41:11.70
We do these investigative pieces for fun.

3017
02:41:11.70 --> 02:41:13.70
Can't see any ego was there for eight years.

3018
02:41:13.70 --> 02:41:15.70
Doing law enforcement.

3019
02:41:15.70 --> 02:41:17.70
Covered our beloved board of patrol.

3020
02:41:17.70 --> 02:41:20.70
And then from near and went to North County.

3021
02:41:20.70 --> 02:41:24.70
And I always lived in North San Diego County.

3022
02:41:24.70 --> 02:41:28.70
And they had a paper called the the O'San side blade citizen.

3023
02:41:28.70 --> 02:41:30.70
So I went to work there.

3024
02:41:30.70 --> 02:41:34.70
The editor's job paid $10 a week more than a report is job.

3025
02:41:34.70 --> 02:41:36.70
So I was like, became an editor.

3026
02:41:36.70 --> 02:41:37.70
Assistant City editor.

3027
02:41:37.70 --> 02:41:40.70
Up in O'San side, which eventually became the North County Times.

3028
02:41:40.70 --> 02:41:42.70
And so I went to work there in October.

3029
02:41:42.70 --> 02:41:45.70
My future bride in December.

3030
02:41:45.70 --> 02:41:47.70
She had two boys.

3031
02:41:47.70 --> 02:41:48.70
I had two girls.

3032
02:41:48.70 --> 02:41:51.70
Ten months later, remarried.

3033
02:41:51.70 --> 02:41:54.70
And so we'll be celebrating our 25th anniversary.

3034
02:41:54.70 --> 02:41:56.70
This, this talk to over.

3035
02:41:56.70 --> 02:41:58.70
And we went to the tiebreaker.

3036
02:41:58.70 --> 02:42:00.70
So the tiebreaker she's 22 now.

3037
02:42:00.70 --> 02:42:05.70
And I worked at the paper until 2008 that I've worked at a couple of non-profit

3038
02:42:05.70 --> 02:42:08.70
Selpening veterans over the last 11 years.

3039
02:42:08.70 --> 02:42:10.70
In between that couple books were good luck.

3040
02:42:10.70 --> 02:42:12.70
Yeah, well, no awesome books.

3041
02:42:12.70 --> 02:42:14.70
It seems like, and this is something that I was like,

3042
02:42:14.70 --> 02:42:20.70
obviously, you know, you went through some, just completely insane and

3043
02:42:20.70 --> 02:42:21.70
tense stuff.

3044
02:42:21.70 --> 02:42:22.70
You come back.

3045
02:42:22.70 --> 02:42:27.70
It seems like you got back into society fairly well,

3046
02:42:27.70 --> 02:42:28.70
fairly quickly.

3047
02:42:28.70 --> 02:42:31.70
And what I always say to guys is like, you need a new mission.

3048
02:42:31.70 --> 02:42:35.70
Like, because what happens when I think guys fall apart is when they come back from

3049
02:42:35.70 --> 02:42:36.70
wherever they're deployed to.

3050
02:42:36.70 --> 02:42:39.70
And they don't, when they come back, they don't know what to do.

3051
02:42:39.70 --> 02:42:42.70
They don't, they don't, they don't go on to the next mission.

3052
02:42:42.70 --> 02:42:44.70
Because you're like, okay, I'm going to go to college.

3053
02:42:44.70 --> 02:42:45.70
I'm going to work at the newspaper.

3054
02:42:45.70 --> 02:42:48.70
I'm going to organize these, you know, we're going to fight this fight.

3055
02:42:48.70 --> 02:42:51.70
And it seems like you got focused on what your next mission was.

3056
02:42:51.70 --> 02:42:55.70
Where I think that's going to a lot of guys don't do well.

3057
02:42:55.70 --> 02:42:58.70
And I was wondering if you saw anything with your friends,

3058
02:42:58.70 --> 02:43:00.70
other Vietnam guys that you served with,

3059
02:43:00.70 --> 02:43:05.70
the guys that seem to get back on track and carry on with their life,

3060
02:43:05.70 --> 02:43:07.70
as opposed to guys that don't.

3061
02:43:07.70 --> 02:43:10.70
Yeah, majority of our guys, I like to think came back.

3062
02:43:10.70 --> 02:43:12.70
And they adjusted one way or the other.

3063
02:43:12.70 --> 02:43:14.70
We had a couple of tragic cases that didn't.

3064
02:43:14.70 --> 02:43:16.70
I mean, when I went back from my second tour,

3065
02:43:16.70 --> 02:43:20.70
I went back with Jeffrey Junkins who was going back for his fifth tour,

3066
02:43:20.70 --> 02:43:23.70
duty, second or third with SF.

3067
02:43:23.70 --> 02:43:26.70
And so we halved on the plane going across, went back.

3068
02:43:26.70 --> 02:43:29.70
We landed in the camera on bay.

3069
02:43:29.70 --> 02:43:32.70
And instead of going through the process, we got our Delfa bag,

3070
02:43:32.70 --> 02:43:35.70
went out, stole Jeep, drove to the train.

3071
02:43:35.70 --> 02:43:38.70
But then go to headquarters, went downtown,

3072
02:43:38.70 --> 02:43:41.70
and party for a little bit, then reported to the train.

3073
02:43:41.70 --> 02:43:44.70
And then went up to CCN there because we were both returning.

3074
02:43:44.70 --> 02:43:47.70
So it was no in country training, none has the.

3075
02:43:47.70 --> 02:43:50.70
And my orders specifically said,

3076
02:43:50.70 --> 02:43:54.70
CCN and I got back to the team right away,

3077
02:43:54.70 --> 02:43:55.70
which you covered earlier.

3078
02:43:55.70 --> 02:43:56.70
Yeah.

3079
02:43:56.70 --> 02:43:59.70
And the other side bar, which really helped was

3080
02:43:59.70 --> 02:44:05.70
at Trenton State College, I was a point man for the POWMIA Concern Center.

3081
02:44:05.70 --> 02:44:07.70
They came out with the bracelets.

3082
02:44:07.70 --> 02:44:10.70
And the whole thing was that effort.

3083
02:44:10.70 --> 02:44:12.70
They had American citizens that were,

3084
02:44:12.70 --> 02:44:13.70
and the family members.

3085
02:44:13.70 --> 02:44:16.70
So first time American family members petitioned,

3086
02:44:16.70 --> 02:44:19.70
an enemy to treat our prisoners better.

3087
02:44:19.70 --> 02:44:22.70
And so our prisons weren't related,

3088
02:44:22.70 --> 02:44:25.70
released until February of 1973,

3089
02:44:25.70 --> 02:44:26.70
way at two years.

3090
02:44:26.70 --> 02:44:29.70
I worked at the POWMIA Concern Center.

3091
02:44:29.70 --> 02:44:32.70
We had a POW and Air Force POW from Trenton.

3092
02:44:32.70 --> 02:44:35.70
We supported him, his, well, his family.

3093
02:44:35.70 --> 02:44:38.70
Relators, everything we could do for,

3094
02:44:38.70 --> 02:44:40.70
in our spare time between classes,

3095
02:44:40.70 --> 02:44:43.70
putting out newspapers and things like that.

3096
02:44:43.70 --> 02:44:46.70
So it was like a really a sub-rosal mission.

3097
02:44:46.70 --> 02:44:49.70
And when the prisoners came home,

3098
02:44:49.70 --> 02:44:50.70
that was just a great moment.

3099
02:44:50.70 --> 02:44:51.70
Mm-hmm.

3100
02:44:51.70 --> 02:44:53.70
And so, but it really was helpful, like they said.

3101
02:44:53.70 --> 02:44:55.70
Another mission that we went into,

3102
02:44:55.70 --> 02:44:58.70
the newspaper going into it.

3103
02:44:58.70 --> 02:45:01.70
And there's a period of time to student government

3104
02:45:01.70 --> 02:45:04.70
voter south of, south of office.

3105
02:45:04.70 --> 02:45:07.70
So the paper was the only student voice.

3106
02:45:07.70 --> 02:45:09.70
So we took a, what does that mean?

3107
02:45:09.70 --> 02:45:10.70
What does that mean?

3108
02:45:10.70 --> 02:45:12.70
The student government voted themselves out of office.

3109
02:45:12.70 --> 02:45:14.70
What does that even mean?

3110
02:45:14.70 --> 02:45:16.70
Hey, this is 1971.

3111
02:45:16.70 --> 02:45:21.70
We had people that were just too busy.

3112
02:45:21.70 --> 02:45:23.70
They didn't think the student government was,

3113
02:45:23.70 --> 02:45:26.70
was, could address issues that were apropos

3114
02:45:26.70 --> 02:45:29.70
to two needs of students or whatever it held that meant.

3115
02:45:29.70 --> 02:45:30.70
Mm-hmm.

3116
02:45:30.70 --> 02:45:31.70
I forget their real reasons,

3117
02:45:31.70 --> 02:45:33.70
but they just, just banned themselves.

3118
02:45:33.70 --> 02:45:35.70
The signal was the only voice on campus.

3119
02:45:35.70 --> 02:45:38.70
And so we became much more active.

3120
02:45:38.70 --> 02:45:41.70
And of course we had a firm of action that was starting then.

3121
02:45:41.70 --> 02:45:46.70
And the teacher strike, we had an outbreak of meningitis.

3122
02:45:46.70 --> 02:45:48.70
We're killed three students.

3123
02:45:48.70 --> 02:45:49.70
Had to cover that.

3124
02:45:49.70 --> 02:45:52.70
And of course, deep in my mind,

3125
02:45:52.70 --> 02:45:54.70
I wanted them to strike.

3126
02:45:54.70 --> 02:45:58.70
I wanted to go out, shut the campus down.

3127
02:45:58.70 --> 02:46:00.70
But it didn't work out.

3128
02:46:00.70 --> 02:46:02.70
How about the, you know,

3129
02:46:02.70 --> 02:46:05.70
how was the treatment, you know?

3130
02:46:05.70 --> 02:46:09.70
You know, as a modern day veteran myself,

3131
02:46:09.70 --> 02:46:13.70
like we get treated just unbelievably ridiculously good.

3132
02:46:13.70 --> 02:46:14.70
Well, that's the benefit from Vietnam.

3133
02:46:14.70 --> 02:46:16.70
We weren't treated well.

3134
02:46:16.70 --> 02:46:20.70
But today, our citizen tree treats our soldiers, sailors,

3135
02:46:20.70 --> 02:46:23.70
appropriately, regardless of the politics.

3136
02:46:23.70 --> 02:46:24.70
Yeah.

3137
02:46:24.70 --> 02:46:25.70
They thank you for the service mostly.

3138
02:46:25.70 --> 02:46:27.70
Yeah, we had cases.

3139
02:46:27.70 --> 02:46:29.70
I mean, I, I wore my fatigue jacket for years,

3140
02:46:29.70 --> 02:46:30.70
just to say, fuck you.

3141
02:46:30.70 --> 02:46:32.70
I'm wearing a few, I don't like it.

3142
02:46:32.70 --> 02:46:33.70
Talk to me about it.

3143
02:46:33.70 --> 02:46:34.70
Mm-hmm.

3144
02:46:34.70 --> 02:46:37.70
And we had a few parties with the newspaper.

3145
02:46:37.70 --> 02:46:39.70
And so everybody,

3146
02:46:39.70 --> 02:46:41.70
almost everybody, set for one or two people,

3147
02:46:41.70 --> 02:46:42.70
were very liberal, of course.

3148
02:46:42.70 --> 02:46:45.70
This is the college, 1971 too.

3149
02:46:45.70 --> 02:46:48.70
And we had this one freak.

3150
02:46:48.70 --> 02:46:50.70
It's like, six, three had as long here.

3151
02:46:50.70 --> 02:46:52.70
And he came up to me and said, you know,

3152
02:46:52.70 --> 02:46:54.70
you guys, I know about you green braids.

3153
02:46:54.70 --> 02:46:56.70
You're fucking baby killers.

3154
02:46:56.70 --> 02:46:57.70
You know, you're going on.

3155
02:46:57.70 --> 02:46:59.70
The whole party comes to a stop.

3156
02:46:59.70 --> 02:47:01.70
So it's mean as creep.

3157
02:47:01.70 --> 02:47:03.70
And so he set a few more things.

3158
02:47:03.70 --> 02:47:04.70
And then, finally, says,

3159
02:47:04.70 --> 02:47:06.70
are you really a baby killer?

3160
02:47:06.70 --> 02:47:07.70
And I said, look,

3161
02:47:07.70 --> 02:47:10.70
the only time we kill babies when we ran out of rations.

3162
02:47:10.70 --> 02:47:11.70
Whoa.

3163
02:47:11.70 --> 02:47:15.70
He just, if he's never, he, that kid was never the same.

3164
02:47:15.70 --> 02:47:17.70
And every boy was kind of like laughing,

3165
02:47:17.70 --> 02:47:19.70
realize how ridiculous this asshole was.

3166
02:47:19.70 --> 02:47:20.70
Yeah.

3167
02:47:20.70 --> 02:47:22.70
So it's like, why get your hands dirty?

3168
02:47:22.70 --> 02:47:23.70
Yeah.

3169
02:47:23.70 --> 02:47:24.70
Yeah.

3170
02:47:24.70 --> 02:47:25.70
So yeah, we had someone that.

3171
02:47:25.70 --> 02:47:27.70
Like, limb black when he came back,

3172
02:47:27.70 --> 02:47:30.70
he was trying to get out of your poor quick

3173
02:47:30.70 --> 02:47:32.70
and took the door, got outside

3174
02:47:32.70 --> 02:47:35.70
and wound up in a long quarter.

3175
02:47:35.70 --> 02:47:37.70
Well, three of four guys came up to him and say,

3176
02:47:37.70 --> 02:47:38.70
hey, man, you're back.

3177
02:47:38.70 --> 02:47:39.70
You got cast.

3178
02:47:39.70 --> 02:47:41.70
We're going to believe you that burden.

3179
02:47:41.70 --> 02:47:44.70
So limb pulled out his 25 caliber browning.

3180
02:47:44.70 --> 02:47:45.70
The little ones you know,

3181
02:47:45.70 --> 02:47:46.70
you put it in your palm.

3182
02:47:46.70 --> 02:47:47.70
Yeah.

3183
02:47:47.70 --> 02:47:48.70
And then goes,

3184
02:47:48.70 --> 02:47:49.70
no, you're not.

3185
02:47:49.70 --> 02:47:50.70
I'm not giving it to you.

3186
02:47:50.70 --> 02:47:51.70
Yeah.

3187
02:47:51.70 --> 02:47:54.70
And the guy, I recognize a cigarette later when I see one.

3188
02:47:54.70 --> 02:47:55.70
Limp put a round between his legs.

3189
02:47:55.70 --> 02:47:56.70
Right there at the airport.

3190
02:47:56.70 --> 02:47:58.70
Day, day, day left.

3191
02:47:58.70 --> 02:48:01.70
But again, it's no respect, you know.

3192
02:48:01.70 --> 02:48:03.70
You just limb just didn't want to get his uniform.

3193
02:48:03.70 --> 02:48:04.70
Where was that? Where was Limp?

3194
02:48:04.70 --> 02:48:06.70
See up and Seattle.

3195
02:48:06.70 --> 02:48:07.70
Yeah.

3196
02:48:07.70 --> 02:48:08.70
Yeah.

3197
02:48:08.70 --> 02:48:10.70
And then,

3198
02:48:10.70 --> 02:48:13.70
how did you start getting re-involved

3199
02:48:13.70 --> 02:48:17.70
with like the special operations group that you're with now?

3200
02:48:17.70 --> 02:48:19.70
I got a phone call from, well, this, too.

3201
02:48:19.70 --> 02:48:21.70
I got a phone call from Spiderman Parks

3202
02:48:21.70 --> 02:48:22.70
in 1983.

3203
02:48:22.70 --> 02:48:24.70
I'm living in Trenton.

3204
02:48:24.70 --> 02:48:27.70
My first wife, first daughter.

3205
02:48:27.70 --> 02:48:31.70
And he said, we got this group special operations association.

3206
02:48:31.70 --> 02:48:32.70
It's our guy.

3207
02:48:32.70 --> 02:48:34.70
So it was formed by Green Braise,

3208
02:48:34.70 --> 02:48:35.70
that ran Recon.

3209
02:48:35.70 --> 02:48:39.70
And we had some hatchet force guys that were the patoon company size operation.

3210
02:48:39.70 --> 02:48:42.70
Like mad dog, Jerry Shriver.

3211
02:48:42.70 --> 02:48:47.70
And they had formed up a few years earlier.

3212
02:48:47.70 --> 02:48:48.70
So I signed up,

3213
02:48:48.70 --> 02:48:51.70
probably in the Trenton and there were unions where different places.

3214
02:48:51.70 --> 02:48:53.70
So I didn't bother to go for a sub-wee year.

3215
02:48:53.70 --> 02:48:56.70
But Spiderman I talked, paid my dues,

3216
02:48:56.70 --> 02:48:59.70
and finally went to, and they started having them in Vegas.

3217
02:48:59.70 --> 02:49:02.70
Me and Jeff Junkers would drive,

3218
02:49:02.70 --> 02:49:04.70
go to Vegas, get into the hotel,

3219
02:49:04.70 --> 02:49:08.70
wait to security guard left and sneak into the reunion,

3220
02:49:08.70 --> 02:49:11.70
hang out with the guys for a day, pick one of our guys,

3221
02:49:11.70 --> 02:49:13.70
crash in their room for the night,

3222
02:49:13.70 --> 02:49:14.70
and then drive home next day.

3223
02:49:14.70 --> 02:49:16.70
But we get to see the guys and no money.

3224
02:49:16.70 --> 02:49:19.70
We get to free food, free drinks, little gas, right?

3225
02:49:19.70 --> 02:49:21.70
So we did that for a couple of years.

3226
02:49:21.70 --> 02:49:23.70
There was a lot of fun.

3227
02:49:23.70 --> 02:49:25.70
And then when I finally met Anna,

3228
02:49:25.70 --> 02:49:28.70
my current wife and my sweetheart forever,

3229
02:49:28.70 --> 02:49:30.70
that kind of came to a close.

3230
02:49:30.70 --> 02:49:32.70
I took Anna one time,

3231
02:49:32.70 --> 02:49:35.70
and the first time was not really completely good experience.

3232
02:49:35.70 --> 02:49:37.70
Some of our guys are still pretty wild,

3233
02:49:37.70 --> 02:49:39.70
and then the hotel wasn't that cool.

3234
02:49:39.70 --> 02:49:42.70
But now, that's more of our guys are snowing now,

3235
02:49:42.70 --> 02:49:43.70
a little bit.

3236
02:49:43.70 --> 02:49:44.70
We've lost some along the way.

3237
02:49:44.70 --> 02:49:47.70
So we happen to be our 43rd reunion.

3238
02:49:47.70 --> 02:49:50.70
But I'm also involved in Special Forces Association,

3239
02:49:50.70 --> 02:49:52.70
Chapter 38 Up and Orange.

3240
02:49:52.70 --> 02:49:55.70
And with our rest room two years ago, a Christmas time,

3241
02:49:55.70 --> 02:49:56.70
I came back.

3242
02:49:56.70 --> 02:49:57.70
I was president.

3243
02:49:57.70 --> 02:50:00.70
So I'm wrapping up my second year

3244
02:50:00.70 --> 02:50:02.70
duty with those gentlemen.

3245
02:50:02.70 --> 02:50:06.70
And what's the nonprofit group that you have?

3246
02:50:06.70 --> 02:50:11.70
We have the Veterans, Veterans of Fortal Housing Program,

3247
02:50:11.70 --> 02:50:12.70
that's out of Orange.

3248
02:50:12.70 --> 02:50:16.70
And then we have a separate nonprofit called

3249
02:50:16.70 --> 02:50:19.70
the American Veterans Assistance Group,

3250
02:50:19.70 --> 02:50:21.70
where we work with programs within our communities.

3251
02:50:21.70 --> 02:50:24.70
We have 45 communities in the five Western states

3252
02:50:24.70 --> 02:50:29.70
that are owned by our company and by our nonprofit.

3253
02:50:29.70 --> 02:50:32.70
And so we encourage the help veterans that have

3254
02:50:32.70 --> 02:50:35.70
fixed income to get them into a affordable housing.

3255
02:50:35.70 --> 02:50:38.70
The manufacturer homes will have expensive

3256
02:50:38.70 --> 02:50:39.70
and stick houses.

3257
02:50:39.70 --> 02:50:43.70
And then we have programs with through our day-back program.

3258
02:50:43.70 --> 02:50:47.70
That programs for meals, meetings, having a guest speakers,

3259
02:50:47.70 --> 02:50:48.70
and things like that.

3260
02:50:48.70 --> 02:50:51.70
And we're doing that in about nine of our communities now.

3261
02:50:51.70 --> 02:50:54.70
So that's what my other job is to do the newsletter.

3262
02:50:54.70 --> 02:50:55.70
Busy.

3263
02:50:55.70 --> 02:50:56.70
Always.

3264
02:50:56.70 --> 02:50:57.70
Always busy.

3265
02:50:57.70 --> 02:50:59.70
Can't like, Clint Eastwood say,

3266
02:50:59.70 --> 02:51:01.70
can't let the old man in.

3267
02:51:01.70 --> 02:51:04.70
Well, I'll tell you what.

3268
02:51:04.70 --> 02:51:07.70
We just hit three hours or something close to that.

3269
02:51:07.70 --> 02:51:10.70
I know I need to let you get out of here.

3270
02:51:10.70 --> 02:51:11.70
Obviously.

3271
02:51:11.70 --> 02:51:15.70
Anything else any other closing thoughts?

3272
02:51:15.70 --> 02:51:18.70
No, just as I said the first time,

3273
02:51:18.70 --> 02:51:21.70
I couldn't have done any of the books without my sweetheart.

3274
02:51:21.70 --> 02:51:25.70
My dear bride, you know, we had 14 ages in

3275
02:51:25.70 --> 02:51:29.70
and a relatively newborn in the house that go right

3276
02:51:29.70 --> 02:51:32.70
and the God bless her without our couldn't have done it.

3277
02:51:32.70 --> 02:51:34.70
So, and that found me today.

3278
02:51:34.70 --> 02:51:37.70
We just learned we got two or three girls

3279
02:51:37.70 --> 02:51:39.70
or pregnant, so we're getting excited about being

3280
02:51:39.70 --> 02:51:42.70
a grandparent or practicing.

3281
02:51:42.70 --> 02:51:44.70
And we're still work with her and I'm profit.

3282
02:51:44.70 --> 02:51:45.70
So moving forward.

3283
02:51:45.70 --> 02:51:48.70
Anything people don't need to that nonprofit.

3284
02:51:48.70 --> 02:51:49.70
Do you have that kind of thing?

3285
02:51:49.70 --> 02:51:50.70
Is there a website or anything like that?

3286
02:51:50.70 --> 02:51:52.70
Or is you guys just run it locally?

3287
02:51:52.70 --> 02:51:55.70
No, they, I'll have to check the website.

3288
02:51:55.70 --> 02:51:57.70
But they could, um,

3289
02:51:57.70 --> 02:51:59.70
I've got my email, my website,

3290
02:51:59.70 --> 02:52:02.70
sawcronicles.com and they could punch in here

3291
02:52:02.70 --> 02:52:05.70
and my emails there and I'll play it to for them.

3292
02:52:05.70 --> 02:52:08.70
We're going through some changes with our website.

3293
02:52:08.70 --> 02:52:09.70
Right, guys.

3294
02:52:09.70 --> 02:52:10.70
You know how that goes.

3295
02:52:10.70 --> 02:52:13.70
But sogcronicles.com is how people can talk to you

3296
02:52:13.70 --> 02:52:14.70
and reach out to you through that.

3297
02:52:14.70 --> 02:52:15.70
Gladly.

3298
02:52:15.70 --> 02:52:20.70
And yeah, come on in and we'll say hi and take it from there.

3299
02:52:20.70 --> 02:52:21.70
Awesome.

3300
02:52:21.70 --> 02:52:22.70
Awesome.

3301
02:52:22.70 --> 02:52:24.70
Well, thank you for this opportunity and your books.

3302
02:52:24.70 --> 02:52:25.70
You really love it.

3303
02:52:25.70 --> 02:52:26.70
Thank you.

3304
02:52:26.70 --> 02:52:27.70
Absolutely.

3305
02:52:27.70 --> 02:52:30.70
This is the honor as a 100% and completely all mine

3306
02:52:30.70 --> 02:52:34.70
to hear the stories which are completely insane

3307
02:52:34.70 --> 02:52:37.70
to learn from your experiences.

3308
02:52:37.70 --> 02:52:40.70
But obviously, or maybe it's not obvious,

3309
02:52:40.70 --> 02:52:42.70
anytime you want to come on the podcast,

3310
02:52:42.70 --> 02:52:45.70
you shoot me a text, you let me know and it will open the door.

3311
02:52:45.70 --> 02:52:46.70
You come in.

3312
02:52:46.70 --> 02:52:47.70
I don't need to say anything.

3313
02:52:47.70 --> 02:52:48.70
You can just talk.

3314
02:52:48.70 --> 02:52:48.70
It's fine with me.

3315
02:52:48.70 --> 02:52:49.70
I'll just listen.

3316
02:52:49.70 --> 02:52:50.70
Like a bad dream.

3317
02:52:50.70 --> 02:52:51.70
I'll be back.

3318
02:52:51.70 --> 02:52:53.70
I look forward to your every second of it.

3319
02:52:53.70 --> 02:52:54.70
Likewise.

3320
02:52:54.70 --> 02:52:56.70
And you know, so thanks for coming on and, and, you know,

3321
02:52:56.70 --> 02:52:57.70
more important.

3322
02:52:57.70 --> 02:53:01.70
And of course, thank you for what you and what your teammates did

3323
02:53:01.70 --> 02:53:04.70
for the service of our great country.

3324
02:53:04.70 --> 02:53:05.70
Likewise, sir.

3325
02:53:05.70 --> 02:53:06.70
Thank you.

3326
02:53:06.70 --> 02:53:09.70
Always indebted to you and men like you.

3327
02:53:09.70 --> 02:53:11.70
So thank you for what you've done.

3328
02:53:11.70 --> 02:53:12.70
Appreciate it.

3329
02:53:12.70 --> 02:53:13.70
Airborne.

3330
02:53:13.70 --> 02:53:14.70
All the way.

3331
02:53:14.70 --> 02:53:15.70
Until next time.

3332
02:53:15.70 --> 02:53:19.70
And once again,

3333
02:53:19.70 --> 02:53:22.70
John Stryker, Meyer,

3334
02:53:22.70 --> 02:53:25.70
Tilt, has left the building.

3335
02:53:25.70 --> 02:53:26.70
What?

3336
02:53:26.70 --> 02:53:30.70
And incredible human being.

3337
02:53:30.70 --> 02:53:34.70
And it's a complete honor.

3338
02:53:34.70 --> 02:53:38.70
And just lucky to be able to sit here and talk to them.

3339
02:53:38.70 --> 02:53:42.70
And here is stories and here and reflect on stuff.

3340
02:53:42.70 --> 02:53:44.70
And it's been a while.

3341
02:53:44.70 --> 02:53:45.70
It's been three hours.

3342
02:53:45.70 --> 02:53:48.70
So anyways, if you liked this conversation,

3343
02:53:48.70 --> 02:53:51.70
this podcast that we just did,

3344
02:53:51.70 --> 02:53:54.70
if you got something out of it,

3345
02:53:54.70 --> 02:53:56.70
which I know I did,

3346
02:53:56.70 --> 02:53:59.70
if you want to support the podcast.

3347
02:53:59.70 --> 02:54:02.70
While you actually support your own self.

3348
02:54:02.70 --> 02:54:04.70
Yes.

3349
02:54:04.70 --> 02:54:08.70
I think Echo can give you some help in making that happen.

3350
02:54:08.70 --> 02:54:09.70
Yep.

3351
02:54:09.70 --> 02:54:11.70
Yes. So, let's go into it.

3352
02:54:11.70 --> 02:54:12.70
Do you just, obviously?

3353
02:54:12.70 --> 02:54:14.70
Do you just, if you're not doing you just, too?

3354
02:54:14.70 --> 02:54:15.70
I would say,

3355
02:54:15.70 --> 02:54:19.70
Jockel and I strongly recommend you.

3356
02:54:19.70 --> 02:54:21.70
I think we're going to say we were disappointed.

3357
02:54:21.70 --> 02:54:22.70
No, see.

3358
02:54:22.70 --> 02:54:24.70
Yeah, maybe.

3359
02:54:24.70 --> 02:54:26.70
Maybe part, but not really.

3360
02:54:26.70 --> 02:54:27.70
At the end of the day,

3361
02:54:27.70 --> 02:54:30.70
there's some understanding to be exercised here.

3362
02:54:30.70 --> 02:54:33.70
Because not every, okay, you ever rolled, you're different.

3363
02:54:33.70 --> 02:54:36.70
But sometimes people roll into Jockel gym or see it on TV

3364
02:54:36.70 --> 02:54:38.70
or even think about it.

3365
02:54:38.70 --> 02:54:40.70
Two people wrestling all hard or whatever.

3366
02:54:40.70 --> 02:54:42.70
Some people just don't automatically want to go do that.

3367
02:54:42.70 --> 02:54:43.70
Mm.

3368
02:54:43.70 --> 02:54:44.70
You know, just automatically.

3369
02:54:44.70 --> 02:54:46.70
On its surface, you might think,

3370
02:54:46.70 --> 02:54:48.70
oh well, that's not really for me.

3371
02:54:48.70 --> 02:54:52.70
I don't really want to grab a grapple with some other dude.

3372
02:54:52.70 --> 02:54:53.70
Oh yeah.

3373
02:54:53.70 --> 02:54:56.70
What you don't see is what's beneath the surface.

3374
02:54:56.70 --> 02:54:57.70
Yeah.

3375
02:54:57.70 --> 02:54:59.70
Because what's beneath the surface is fitness.

3376
02:54:59.70 --> 02:55:04.70
Flexibility, mobility, mental, stamina.

3377
02:55:04.70 --> 02:55:05.70
Yeah.

3378
02:55:05.70 --> 02:55:07.70
Physical, stamina.

3379
02:55:07.70 --> 02:55:07.70
Yeah.

3380
02:55:07.70 --> 02:55:10.70
Cardiovascular improvement, strength improvement.

3381
02:55:10.70 --> 02:55:13.70
On top of all that, you guess what you get?

3382
02:55:13.70 --> 02:55:17.70
A legitimate skill that you can actually choke another person.

3383
02:55:17.70 --> 02:55:18.70
That's bigger than you.

3384
02:55:18.70 --> 02:55:19.70
Yeah.

3385
02:55:19.70 --> 02:55:20.70
That's stronger than you.

3386
02:55:20.70 --> 02:55:20.70
Yeah.

3387
02:55:20.70 --> 02:55:21.70
You can take them.

3388
02:55:21.70 --> 02:55:22.70
Yes.

3389
02:55:22.70 --> 02:55:23.70
So.

3390
02:55:23.70 --> 02:55:25.70
And, you know, if I speak for myself,

3391
02:55:25.70 --> 02:55:28.70
the reason I started and continued with Jockels

3392
02:55:28.70 --> 02:55:31.70
with Jockels, because it's the skill that you're talking about,

3393
02:55:31.70 --> 02:55:33.70
that you learn.

3394
02:55:33.70 --> 02:55:34.70
Mm.

3395
02:55:34.70 --> 02:55:36.70
That skill is this.

3396
02:55:36.70 --> 02:55:39.70
If someone, if someone insist on fighting you,

3397
02:55:39.70 --> 02:55:40.70
Mm.

3398
02:55:40.70 --> 02:55:41.70
You can win the fight.

3399
02:55:41.70 --> 02:55:42.70
Yeah.

3400
02:55:42.70 --> 02:55:42.70
You win the fight.

3401
02:55:42.70 --> 02:55:44.70
And before you learn how to fight,

3402
02:55:44.70 --> 02:55:46.70
and I'm speaking generally speaking,

3403
02:55:46.70 --> 02:55:48.70
um, before you learn to fight,

3404
02:55:48.70 --> 02:55:50.70
you think, ah, you know,

3405
02:55:50.70 --> 02:55:51.70
I'm, I'll just do this.

3406
02:55:51.70 --> 02:55:52.70
Oh yeah.

3407
02:55:52.70 --> 02:55:54.70
You know, I'm stronger than that guy or,

3408
02:55:54.70 --> 02:55:55.70
I'm bigger than that guy.

3409
02:55:55.70 --> 02:55:56.70
That would ever.

3410
02:55:56.70 --> 02:55:57.70
Yeah, you know.

3411
02:55:57.70 --> 02:55:59.70
And you don't realize how, how untrue,

3412
02:55:59.70 --> 02:56:01.70
how un, you know how I've said we lie to ourselves.

3413
02:56:01.70 --> 02:56:02.70
Yes.

3414
02:56:02.70 --> 02:56:03.70
Like we lie to ourselves.

3415
02:56:03.70 --> 02:56:05.70
This is a whole other category of lying to yourself.

3416
02:56:05.70 --> 02:56:06.70
Yeah.

3417
02:56:06.70 --> 02:56:07.70
Because the one category is like we lie to ourselves.

3418
02:56:07.70 --> 02:56:09.70
Like, oh, it's just one doughnut.

3419
02:56:09.70 --> 02:56:10.70
It's not that big of a thing.

3420
02:56:10.70 --> 02:56:11.70
That's just a lie.

3421
02:56:11.70 --> 02:56:12.70
You're lying to yourself.

3422
02:56:12.70 --> 02:56:13.70
Or, well, I don't,

3423
02:56:13.70 --> 02:56:15.70
I can't make it to the gym today,

3424
02:56:15.70 --> 02:56:16.70
because, you know, my, you know,

3425
02:56:16.70 --> 02:56:17.70
it's, it's getting a little late.

3426
02:56:17.70 --> 02:56:18.70
That's a lie.

3427
02:56:18.70 --> 02:56:19.70
You know, it's a lie.

3428
02:56:19.70 --> 02:56:21.70
But an even bigger lie is,

3429
02:56:21.70 --> 02:56:23.70
I'm more capable.

3430
02:56:23.70 --> 02:56:24.70
I'm capable.

3431
02:56:24.70 --> 02:56:25.70
Yeah.

3432
02:56:25.70 --> 02:56:26.70
In certain situations.

3433
02:56:26.70 --> 02:56:27.70
And you're not in your thing.

3434
02:56:27.70 --> 02:56:29.70
And you still talk to people like this.

3435
02:56:29.70 --> 02:56:30.70
Oh, I like, oh, you know,

3436
02:56:30.70 --> 02:56:32.70
we'll feel really came down to it.

3437
02:56:32.70 --> 02:56:32.70
Yeah.

3438
02:56:32.70 --> 02:56:33.70
Yeah.

3439
02:56:33.70 --> 02:56:34.70
I, you know,

3440
02:56:34.70 --> 02:56:36.70
and I lift to,

3441
02:56:36.70 --> 02:56:36.70
Yeah.

3442
02:56:36.70 --> 02:56:38.70
And I got strong cardio.

3443
02:56:38.70 --> 02:56:40.70
Who's going to be able to take me?

3444
02:56:40.70 --> 02:56:41.70
I'll tell you who.

3445
02:56:41.70 --> 02:56:42.70
A,

3446
02:56:42.70 --> 02:56:42.70
a,

3447
02:56:42.70 --> 02:56:43.70
14 year old girl.

3448
02:56:43.70 --> 02:56:44.70
Yeah.

3449
02:56:44.70 --> 02:56:46.70
That knows how to, you know,

3450
02:56:46.70 --> 02:56:47.70
choke you.

3451
02:56:47.70 --> 02:56:48.70
Yeah.

3452
02:56:48.70 --> 02:56:49.70
That's who.

3453
02:56:49.70 --> 02:56:49.70
Yeah.

3454
02:56:49.70 --> 02:56:51.70
Just like in pool,

3455
02:56:51.70 --> 02:56:52.70
right?

3456
02:56:52.70 --> 02:56:53.70
You're like pool.

3457
02:56:53.70 --> 02:56:53.70
Yeah.

3458
02:56:53.70 --> 02:56:54.70
You get billiards.

3459
02:56:54.70 --> 02:56:55.70
Billiards.

3460
02:56:55.70 --> 02:56:56.70
Yeah.

3461

And it's like, yeah,

3464
02:56:59.70 --> 02:57:01.70
I know, I see what's going on.

3465
02:57:01.70 --> 02:57:03.70
I do hit this ball to hit that ball.

3466
02:57:03.70 --> 02:57:04.70
I'm going the thing.

3467
02:57:04.70 --> 02:57:05.70
Yeah.

3468
02:57:05.70 --> 02:57:06.70
That's no problem.

3469
02:57:06.70 --> 02:57:07.70
I'm pretty smart.

3470
02:57:07.70 --> 02:57:08.70
I'm pretty coordinated.

3471
02:57:08.70 --> 02:57:09.70
You know,

3472
02:57:09.70 --> 02:57:10.70
I'm just like,

3473
02:57:10.70 --> 02:57:12.70
that's just how my mind how hard can it be.

3474
02:57:12.70 --> 02:57:13.70
Exactly.

3475
02:57:13.70 --> 02:57:14.70
Right.

3476
02:57:14.70 --> 02:57:16.70
And you go play against the guy who really who knows how to play pool.

3477
02:57:16.70 --> 02:57:16.70
You'd be like,

3478
02:57:16.70 --> 02:57:17.70
how do you even do that?

3479
02:57:17.70 --> 02:57:18.70
Like,

3480
02:57:18.70 --> 02:57:19.70
How did you even like figure that?

3481
02:57:19.70 --> 02:57:20.70
But they know,

3482
02:57:20.70 --> 02:57:22.70
they just know it's not like it's this magic thing.

3483
02:57:22.70 --> 02:57:24.70
They just sort of know same thing with you.

3484
02:57:24.70 --> 02:57:25.70
And in fact,

3485
02:57:25.70 --> 02:57:28.70
it's such a mystery when you actually do it.

3486
02:57:28.70 --> 02:57:29.70
How easily they beat you.

3487
02:57:29.70 --> 02:57:33.70
It's such a weird magic mystery that you don't even comprehend it.

3488
02:57:33.70 --> 02:57:33.70
Yeah,

3489
02:57:33.70 --> 02:57:34.70

You're going to do it.

3531

3541
02:58:27.66 --> 02:58:30.30
Well, you're not really the customer mine were T and E

3542
02:58:32.50 --> 02:58:33.86
You know what that is a

3543
02:58:34.54 --> 02:58:36.54
Research and develop test and evaluation

3544
02:58:36.54 --> 02:58:39.54
So I'm testing the value

3545
02:58:39.54 --> 02:58:42.74
Yeah, and I just got another test evaluation for the next phase

3546
02:58:43.38 --> 02:58:45.38
Yeah, because I'm making another phase

3547
02:58:46.26 --> 02:58:54.52
We lie to ourselves as always men once said anyway. No. I don't have jeans, but I from what I imagine from what I see in gather

3548
02:58:54.96 --> 02:58:57.70
You know from the field. They're good jeans

3549
02:58:57.70 --> 02:59:00.46
You know this is this is a good psychological good

3550
02:59:00.74 --> 02:59:02.74
Flanking maneuvering you just did right now

3551
02:59:02.74 --> 02:59:06.66
Because Pete Ryan will hear this nobody like oh, it doesn't even have jeans

3552
02:59:06.66 --> 02:59:12.02
No, no, I will get 100% better get them to them. Nope. Did you do you text them and say hey can I get a pair of jeans?

3553
02:59:12.02 --> 02:59:17.18
That's whatever mean Brian share text and paint by the way how like oh

3554
02:59:17.70 --> 02:59:21.46
We're the last we're the only ones that we literally know that don't have jeans

3555
02:59:21.46 --> 02:59:26.02
You know and then so he text me the other day or even worse

3556
02:59:28.02 --> 02:59:31.40
About his jeans and you know me I'm over here. Well, then again

3557
02:59:31.40 --> 02:59:35.70
I'm where the the shark fin sure you know what are you going to show it so they make that's all right

3558
02:59:35.70 --> 02:59:37.70
Where so whatever

3559
02:59:37.70 --> 02:59:42.38
He presenting he present in big time, but they happen to be the best show you wear jeans very often me

3560
02:59:42.98 --> 02:59:45.42
Maybe that's why not not why you're too vocal about it

3561
02:59:45.98 --> 02:59:48.48
But you would be if you had them on

3562
02:59:48.48 --> 02:59:53.82
I knew he like yeah, maybe I'm just sorry grapes like I don't even want any cool all right

3563
02:59:53.82 --> 02:59:55.82
Well, I do have them

3564
02:59:56.22 --> 02:59:59.48
How are they? They are totally good to go there the next level

3565
02:59:59.48 --> 03:00:04.36
Square the way awesome. Yep, you can get jeans you can get t-shirts you can get

3566
03:00:05.36 --> 03:00:11.72
Supplements we have supplements we got we got joint warfare which you should take we got kill Kerala oil we got discipline to discipline go

3567
03:00:12.32 --> 03:00:15.32
discipline go is like get your

3568
03:00:17.40 --> 03:00:22.82
cognitive wheels spinning turning moving quickly sharp

3569
03:00:23.84 --> 03:00:27.74
So we have discipline going to can come in out. I think it's actually out right now

3570
03:00:27.74 --> 03:00:33.38
Yeah, the little yeah, yeah, see that those are good. Is it the same formula the one the test one that they're

3571
03:00:33.58 --> 03:00:38.46
Yes, okay good. Yeah, that's that one's good. Yeah, here's the thing what all of these right?

3572
03:00:38.46 --> 03:00:42.000
So you have joint warfare krill oil right the combo. That's the best way to go for you

3573
03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:43.50
Join since stuff and then you know

3574
03:00:43.98 --> 03:00:46.62
discipline and then the milk and and everything

3575
03:00:47.02 --> 03:00:52.94
Okay, consider this right as you get older and you still want a fight because man I got it. I got to be honest with you

3576
03:00:52.94 --> 03:00:58.94
You know you know you catch the wave of just consistency. I know you're a consistent person and discipline

3577
03:00:58.94 --> 03:01:03.82
I bet on that wave. Okay, it's a tsunami right so you're the poster child of us

3578
03:01:03.82 --> 03:01:07.58
I do have the dingy knee right now. Yes, which is

3579
03:01:08.46 --> 03:01:13.66
We're almost there. Yes, but you know, okay, you know how some people can catch

3580
03:01:14.42 --> 03:01:16.42
various levels of

3581
03:01:16.42 --> 03:01:24.18
How should I say flourishing flourishes of activity you know where they'll catch the wave of consistency

3582
03:01:24.18 --> 03:01:31.06
Meaning like everything they're doing in their life is like I'm being disciplined and I'm in the zone where it's like just second nature

3583
03:01:31.06 --> 03:01:36.94
Now boom boom boom everything right so if you take all of these supplements that's gonna keep you on there

3584
03:01:37.42 --> 03:01:42.98
Yeah, especially as you get older. Oh, I don't know about the older parks. I'm just kind of the same as I was

3585
03:01:42.98 --> 03:01:47.38
That's just how for you, but take it from someone who's getting older

3586
03:01:48.26 --> 03:01:54.90
Actually getting older. Uh, these I think I as far as my workouts like they're hard they're harder than most of the workouts

3587
03:01:54.90 --> 03:01:57.38
I did when I was young and I'm just maintaining big time

3588
03:01:58.10 --> 03:02:04.34
As far as like staying in the game. Sure. I'm sure anyway you get the consistent combo. That's that's in my opinion

3589
03:02:04.34 --> 03:02:06.34
How you do it also I mentioned milk

3590
03:02:07.38 --> 03:02:09.78
Additional protein in the form of a dessert

3591
03:02:09.78 --> 03:02:14.10
In the form of a delicious like drink that's so tasty. You know

3592
03:02:14.58 --> 03:02:18.66
It was it was telling me like the they were saying oh it was Dave

3593
03:02:19.22 --> 03:02:23.38
Good deal. Yeah. Yeah good deal. Dave was was saying he's at a point now

3594
03:02:23.94 --> 03:02:29.94
Where he's drinking strawberry milk he goes listen. It's one thing to be okay

3595
03:02:30.58 --> 03:02:33.78
It's time for dessert or I am a little bit hungry

3596
03:02:33.78 --> 03:02:40.34
It's another thing to just be sitting around or walking through your awesome beat is just think for no reason other than

3597
03:02:41.86 --> 03:02:48.02
I want to taste the goodness yeah, I'm just gonna go have a strawberry milk. Yeah strawberry slayer right now

3598
03:02:48.02 --> 03:02:52.42
And you know I understand because I've done that before and this is what I thought it was a danger

3599
03:02:52.82 --> 03:02:59.06
The thing is you there's no guilt in that, but here's the thing the concept kind of made me feel a little bit guilty when I was doing that

3600
03:02:59.06 --> 03:03:05.38
Because you know how the kind where you're just like at home board and you see the cookies and you're like it was an easy path and you took it

3601
03:03:05.78 --> 03:03:11.22
It was a desire that you succumb to yes, so that might and be a bad pattern to go down

3602
03:03:11.22 --> 03:03:20.02
Yes, so you gotta be careful. Don't get don't allow the goodness of milk to start to train your brain to accept things that you just want

3603
03:03:20.02 --> 03:03:20.98
Yes

3604
03:03:20.98 --> 03:03:27.06
With you can make an exception with milk. You can be like, hey, I really want this right now just for just for the sake of wanting it

3605
03:03:27.06 --> 03:03:34.66
Yes, but don't think hey, don't know yeah, there's a slippery slope, bro. It is it's bad good

3606
03:03:35.70 --> 03:03:41.14
Yeah, sure, so just be where the mindset essentially there's other flavors to if you don't like strawberry

3607
03:03:41.14 --> 03:03:47.30
Which some people don't who is it Jason Gardner Jason's like don't like strawberry good job Jason

3608
03:03:48.74 --> 03:03:50.98
He's over there, but he he takes that little

3609
03:03:50.98 --> 03:03:58.74
Hitter with his coffee in the morning. He's got his little ritual scenario. He's got going on

3610
03:03:59.14 --> 03:04:03.06
That makes sense though. Strawberry coffee. I can't

3611
03:04:04.26 --> 03:04:06.26
Oneyalia there

3612
03:04:06.26 --> 03:04:07.62
Then you got mint

3613
03:04:07.62 --> 03:04:11.62
Peanut butter the peanut butter is also off-puck so it's the mint. That's the OG

3614
03:04:12.74 --> 03:04:17.86
Do we just say OG we did big time and then don't forget about the warrior kid milk

3615
03:04:17.86 --> 03:04:22.02
Which is the warrior kid milk for your kid either that you can give them poison

3616
03:04:23.30 --> 03:04:27.46
You can give them poison which oh you got a bunch of corn syrup in this drink. I'm gonna give it to my child

3617
03:04:27.46 --> 03:04:32.42
So that's that I give them type two diabetes or you can get him something that makes them stronger smarter faster

3618
03:04:32.42 --> 03:04:37.54
Better yes, warrior kid where your kid milk strawberry and chocolate gets them also joccal weight

3619
03:04:38.34 --> 03:04:41.22
Certified organic but they're good

3620
03:04:41.46 --> 03:04:45.62
My crew how we can call it micro doses the caffeine there's like many many doses

3621
03:04:45.62 --> 03:04:49.06
Yes, what it is yeah, there's it's 60 milligrams per can

3622
03:04:49.06 --> 03:04:53.54
Sortle like a cup of coffee. It also has the antioxidants and they're also days good

3623
03:04:54.26 --> 03:04:57.26
Refresh very free so there you go and

3624
03:04:58.90 --> 03:05:05.42
Well obviously obviously yeah if you want to deadlift 8000 pounds obviously yes the chocolate

3625
03:05:05.42 --> 03:05:07.42
That's the one also certified

3626
03:05:09.42 --> 03:05:11.06
Also we have a store

3627
03:05:11.06 --> 03:05:16.02
Jocco as a store. I say we have so we all have a store if you want to get your merchandise

3628
03:05:16.74 --> 03:05:22.46
I haven't said that word merch. I don't really say that word that much just said it and you said it in a real

3629
03:05:23.06 --> 03:05:25.06
Kind of

3630
03:05:25.06 --> 03:05:29.54
You know why because my daughter watches you two videos which I had to block her

3631
03:05:29.54 --> 03:05:33.70
I though not block her, but you know how you gotta put the block on YouTube

3632
03:05:33.78 --> 03:05:37.86
So only they can only see certain things anyway. I had to do that. She's like you're like okay

3633
03:05:37.86 --> 03:05:42.78
The only thing she's a lot to watch is two two videos jockel podcast for your kid podcast

3634
03:05:42.78 --> 03:05:48.38
I don't know man. She can take it to any way the reason I did that was because she was following some girl on there

3635
03:05:48.38 --> 03:05:51.50
Who's really she was just real sassy. She wasn't it was like the rocketry

3636
03:05:51.50 --> 03:05:58.74
She just had a sassy way of talking maybe 15 maybe 16 years old. Yeah, that's my estimate and my daughter six

3637
03:05:58.74 --> 03:06:04.70
So this girl's talking about this and then it's my daughter starting to say this stuff

3638
03:06:04.70 --> 03:06:09.92
Which is cute at first in my opinion, but after while you're like hey, you can't talk like that

3639
03:06:09.92 --> 03:06:14.26
Not yet. Yeah, what we're doing over here. We're doing exactly right so she

3640
03:06:14.82 --> 03:06:19.18
Anyway, so recently within life past like two days we had to block her anyway

3641
03:06:19.18 --> 03:06:24.10
One of the things she kept saying was like merch and she'd say it all sassy like I'm not gonna do it again

3642
03:06:24.10 --> 03:06:28.50
I'm not gonna say it again, but that's how she was saying it so it just slipped into your head

3643
03:06:28.50 --> 03:06:32.18
Flip right out of your mouth right out of talking about the moon

3644
03:06:32.18 --> 03:06:36.26
So that's why okay, so what can you get at yeah

3645
03:06:36.26 --> 03:06:42.34

03:07:21.58 --> 03:07:25.82
Don't talk just get after it shirt. Okay, and I go

3655
03:07:25.82 --> 03:07:27.82
Co-man

3656
03:07:29.02 --> 03:07:33.82
We don't have that shirt. Yeah, so there are what do we call?

3657
03:07:34.86 --> 03:07:38.78
Knock off knock off. Yeah, they're what do you call like?

3658
03:07:39.50 --> 03:07:44.14
Yeah, there's like a word for a disapprentint chunk. Yeah, they're disapproved, but they're kind of worth

3659
03:07:44.14 --> 03:07:47.18
Cool and approved they're like worse. This is why because

3660
03:07:48.14 --> 03:07:50.46
People will they don't know the layers. You know how like

3661
03:07:51.18 --> 03:07:52.78
Remember the layers you

3662
03:07:52.78 --> 03:07:54.78
Just pause shirt and you would aid

3663
03:07:55.58 --> 03:08:00.22
$1 for it and it has no layers came with no layers no layers man, and that's bad

3664
03:08:01.42 --> 03:08:07.60
And it's a piece of crap shirt. Yes, so it's kind of like when you buy something for the kid

3665
03:08:07.60 --> 03:08:11.10
For you you have a reason to buy something, right? And this is generally speaking

3666
03:08:11.10 --> 03:08:15.74
I know different reasons vary from just person to person but you have a reason you buy something, right?

3667
03:08:15.90 --> 03:08:21.42
Let's say there's two reasons to buy a shirt one of these shirts. No, let's say there's one reason straight up one reason

3668
03:08:21.42 --> 03:08:26.70
The main reason is the layers you can't you know and literally you can spray paint this link was free to mind

3669
03:08:26.70 --> 03:08:30.62
Sure if you're on display you can have that on yeah, you can do that totally can

3670
03:08:31.26 --> 03:08:36.10
You can have one pre-nade you can go to a website and whatever font you want you can make it look

3671
03:08:36.10 --> 03:08:38.10
However you want literally

3672
03:08:38.10 --> 03:08:40.10
So why won't you do that right?

3673
03:08:40.34 --> 03:08:44.66
Because you want more than just that there's something else whatever that reason is you're in the game

3674
03:08:44.82 --> 03:08:47.82
Whatever reason is we'll call it x reason x

3675
03:08:47.82 --> 03:08:54.06
If you go buy stop talking get after it shirt you literally bought something else you didn't buy

3676
03:08:55.34 --> 03:08:57.34
an x check you out

3677
03:08:57.34 --> 03:08:59.34
Think about this one you know

3678
03:09:01.02 --> 03:09:02.38
I

3679
03:09:02.38 --> 03:09:04.38
Isn't but but nonetheless

3680
03:09:05.10 --> 03:09:06.38
No because I

3681
03:09:06.38 --> 03:09:08.38
some shirt kind of creator you feel like

3682
03:09:08.94 --> 03:09:10.94
people are kind of

3683
03:09:10.94 --> 03:09:18.22
No maybe but defending you in this way though because there is a there's a shirt thing called like it's

3684
03:09:18.78 --> 03:09:22.94
T red spring or I don't know something where basically you can go online

3685
03:09:23.58 --> 03:09:28.90
Take a jpeg of a picture and get anyone picture of you online

3686
03:09:29.58 --> 03:09:34.50
Submit it to this website. It'll make a mock-up of the shirt like you know the cheap shirts

3687
03:09:34.50 --> 03:09:37.26
You know the buy-bombolk maybe second-hand

3688
03:09:37.86 --> 03:09:39.38
Whatever shirts

3689
03:09:39.38 --> 03:09:45.54
Make a mock-up and be like hey guys, buy my shirt right and I saw your face on it and it was like kind of a

3690
03:09:46.02 --> 03:09:51.30
Literally the wrong design right they were trying to copy exactly, but they're already seen this. Yes

3691
03:09:51.30 --> 03:09:54.10
So this is a while yeah, and I saw it and I was like man

3692
03:09:54.90 --> 03:10:01.86
You know I'll down in TJ like they'll knock off like Louis Vuitton versus and stuff at least it looks like the Louis Vuitton logo

3693
03:10:01.86 --> 03:10:06.74
You know and you got to look close to see the you know the the quality the lapsing quality

3694
03:10:06.74 --> 03:10:10.30
But this one was like flaggeringly wrong design, you know whoever

3695
03:10:10.74 --> 03:10:14.74
Mean while they're like selling it like their thing. Yeah, it was offensive for sure

3696
03:10:14.74 --> 03:10:19.70
And it's offensive on two levels because offensive kind of to us is like hey, that's not our stuff don't miss represent

3697
03:10:19.70 --> 03:10:23.22
That's A B the person who doesn't quite you know

3698
03:10:23.22 --> 03:10:25.22
They're just new and fired up. They can be the hey

3699
03:10:25.22 --> 03:10:28.34
There's one here's the first one that popped up on Google and they're gonna get the junk one

3700
03:10:28.34 --> 03:10:32.94
They're gonna go out try to represent in the wild and but that's just not gonna work man. That's a bugger

3701
03:10:33.10 --> 03:10:36.22
That is a no support no support and you know

3702
03:10:36.22 --> 03:10:39.70
I get it you know support isn't the primary reason when you think of true

3703
03:10:39.70 --> 03:10:41.86
Like you got to go out there. It's someone buys a shirt

3704
03:10:41.86 --> 03:10:47.22
They want to know what there's there no, but that being said there are some people that they don't really need another shirt

3705
03:10:47.22 --> 03:10:52.78
They're literally just to support. Yes, sir plenty of people just said or just hey we appreciate

3706
03:10:53.50 --> 03:10:55.50
The time the effort to whatever

3707
03:10:56.06 --> 03:11:00.86
Appreciate it there's a little thank you little support. Yeah, that's not wrong with that that's appreciated

3708
03:11:01.18 --> 03:11:04.14
That's you know that allows us to that allows us

3709
03:11:04.14 --> 03:11:08.14

3713
03:11:23.78 --> 03:11:30.66
Don't care. It's all still true. How about that and yes, the myth the stuff that you really want to represent the

You gotta be like

3721
03:11:56.06 --> 03:12:01.30
Anyway, cuz you know cuz shipping certain parts in like the kid is shipping is crazy from here is what I'm saying

3722
03:12:01.30 --> 03:12:05.54
So boom you want to you want to side step the shipping little bit you can do that might take a little bit longer

3723
03:12:05.54 --> 03:12:07.98
I think maybe I'm not sure I don't live in the UK

3724
03:12:07.98 --> 03:12:09.98
But nonetheless some people ask me about that

3725
03:12:10.62 --> 03:12:13.02

3732
03:12:47.70 --> 03:12:50.94
Not just time cuz it takes a little bit of time to prep

We know so sometimes I'm like well, I could just do a Q and A for the kids

Which is what it started out as

3736
03:13:03.20 --> 03:13:09.48
Which is fine, which I I get it so but sometimes I feel like I'm letting everyone down

3737
03:13:09.48 --> 03:13:15.30
If I don't do the story from Uncle Jake's childhood. Yes, because I really like doing the story of some Uncle Jake childhood

So I was like, yeah, I don't I don't really do that workout, but I looked into it and I might be beneficial

3785
03:17:09.48 --> 03:17:13.88
The maces definitely when I'm official yeah, the while the mace and

3786
03:17:13.88 --> 03:17:20.80
They're both beneficial the things beneficial about them. They're awkward. Yes, they're hard to handle yeah, you know

3787
03:17:20.80 --> 03:17:25.88
Well, I've been doing like a lot of kettlebells like heavier for as many reps

3788
03:17:25.88 --> 03:17:29.52
You know, it's like that kind of how this difference, you know, you can do a light kettlebell for a long nest

3789
03:17:29.68 --> 03:17:30.68
Anyway

3790
03:17:30.68 --> 03:17:34.44
The more awkward kind of the thing and you've been doing those sandbags too

3791
03:17:34.44 --> 03:17:40.44
Yeah, you were sad I was sad yeah, man those awkward things here's a good exercise with the sandbag

3792
03:17:40.44 --> 03:17:44.88
You just take your sandbag just heav it over your head turn around heav it over your head turn around heav it over your head

3793
03:17:44.88 --> 03:17:49.16
That's actually tiring. Oh, you're gonna find that to be more tiring than you expect

3794
03:17:49.16 --> 03:17:51.24
Especially because the first one you're like oh

3795
03:17:51.64 --> 03:17:55.16
Joc was said this was gonna be tiring. It's not then you do number three and you're like

3796
03:17:55.64 --> 03:17:58.96
Joc was not right you number five and you're like why am I breathing hard

3797
03:18:00.16 --> 03:18:05.04
And then you do it like seven times you like why might you been doing this because it's too painful. Yes, that's my experience

3798
03:18:05.04 --> 03:18:10.56
Nonetheless, I get I've been doing it and consistently kind of for the first time in life or I'll be like, oh, yeah, I try the work

3799
03:18:10.56 --> 03:18:13.80
It's cool for a week or two and I say it's cool workouts good workout. I get it

3800
03:18:13.80 --> 03:18:18.80
But I've been doing it for like long time now kettlebells like these awkward thing and

3801
03:18:19.56 --> 03:18:23.36
Injuditsu I feel this it's not weird because it's new

3802
03:18:23.36 --> 03:18:28.84
So it's this new like lack of tiredness you know how there's like different tiredness is in Juditsu

3803
03:18:28.84 --> 03:18:32.96
Where you like okay? We're wrong with you know various people, you know, yeah

3804
03:18:32.96 --> 03:18:39.16
Not you you need's out I get it and you know when you come back we can roll it whatever and maybe I can really put my non-tiredness to the test

3805
03:18:39.16 --> 03:18:42.68
But yeah, like I'm saying you get a few different types of tiredness

3806
03:18:42.68 --> 03:18:48.56
Yeah, the kind where they're breathing like a disco bow that has nine like a hundred and fifty minutes different names for snow

3807
03:18:48.56 --> 03:18:49.76
You know

3808
03:18:49.76 --> 03:18:51.44
They're not styles of tired

3809
03:18:51.44 --> 03:18:54.24
Native no because there's oh think about it

3810
03:18:54.56 --> 03:18:57.32
There's the kind of kindness where you're breathing real hard, but you know

3811
03:18:57.32 --> 03:19:01.76
You can still generate kind of force with your muscles, you know your muscles aren't like noodly and yeah

3812
03:19:01.76 --> 03:19:07.84
Like you're like you're not in muscle failure, yes, which is different different and they already call that type of tired

3813
03:19:08.56 --> 03:19:10.16
muscle failure

3814
03:19:10.16 --> 03:19:14.40
You need to make a bascoma words for all these different things all your different forms of fatigue

3815
03:19:14.96 --> 03:19:19.20
Anyway, or you can be like dang I'm not breathing hard, but I just I'm just so weak my butt

3816
03:19:19.20 --> 03:19:21.84
I can't live my heart you've trained with me. You know that kind. How much of you trained with me?

3817
03:19:22.32 --> 03:19:23.32
I don't know

3818
03:19:23.32 --> 03:19:27.44
Infinity times what what how do you describe my tired?

3819
03:19:27.44 --> 03:19:33.76
I'm trying to think have you ever seen me get tired?

3820
03:19:33.76 --> 03:19:40.000
I have with me no, no, I've been tired. I'll tell you there's a couple times I totally remember getting tired

3821
03:19:41.04 --> 03:19:42.88

3830
03:20:16.16 --> 03:20:21.04
It's like not even nearly as well like I really got to get pushed to feel a bit so anyway

3831
03:20:21.04 --> 03:20:25.12
Point is yeah go to on it dot com slash jockel look at all the cool stuff on there

Way the warrior kid marks mission and where there's a will check them out

3840
03:21:04.48 --> 03:21:09.84
They're in multiple different languages to check that out if you speak a different language or your children speak a different language

3841
03:21:09.84 --> 03:21:12.08
You can get that also about Mikey in the dragons

3842
03:21:12.08 --> 03:21:17.20
Mike in the dragons is the book that should be read to every kid at

3843
03:21:18.40 --> 03:21:22.64
least once a day from the ages of one until six

3844
03:21:24.16 --> 03:21:26.16
Okay, I just read it in a

3845
03:21:27.76 --> 03:21:29.76
First grade class

3846
03:21:29.76 --> 03:21:33.28
You went in the lead to a first grade class and read it

3847
03:21:34.64 --> 03:21:36.88
I went in there. I got nuts

3848
03:21:36.88 --> 03:21:42.40
I told all the kids because I know it's like they're trying to they're goal of a teachers to keep the kids calm right

3849
03:21:42.40 --> 03:21:46.80
I come in there. No, it's not happening. So I'm like good morning children and like they're like good morning

3850
03:21:46.80 --> 03:21:51.84
And I'm like what good morning what I can't hear you what I'm not sure what you're saying

3851
03:21:51.84 --> 03:21:53.84
Can you please be louder?

3852
03:21:54.88 --> 03:21:58.40
So they're amped and as I was getting them all amped up I started getting nervous

3853
03:21:58.64 --> 03:22:01.36
Because I said wait a second. I'm getting these kids completely

3854
03:22:01.36 --> 03:22:08.96
Just jacked up and getting crazy and hyper and then I'm gonna expect them to sit and listen to me read this book which is a 15

3855
03:22:09.12 --> 03:22:11.12
Maybe an 18 minute read

3856
03:22:11.12 --> 03:22:13.12
It's not it's not short

3857
03:22:13.12 --> 03:22:19.36
It's not short and so I was like, oh, I might have overset my balance. I might have done I'm gonna made a wrong tactical call

3858
03:22:21.28 --> 03:22:25.28
So then I crack open the book and this after you know I'm answering a couple questions

3859
03:22:25.28 --> 03:22:29.04
I crack open the book. I read it boom silence and total attention

3860
03:22:29.04 --> 03:22:33.04
For 18 minutes while I read the book so that

3861
03:22:34.08 --> 03:22:38.40
Book and I was to explain to the kids that I put I put words nice and listen

3862
03:22:38.72 --> 03:22:44.40
There's words in this book that you when you read them people are saying that that words too big of a word

3863
03:22:45.04 --> 03:22:48.24
For a little kid I said these people want to make you stupid

3864
03:22:48.72 --> 03:22:52.48
I want to make you smart when you see this word and I open up poise there's a thing right

3865
03:22:52.48 --> 03:22:55.68
We use the word poise. I rhyme it with noise

3866
03:22:55.68 --> 03:23:02.72
And I said these people don't want you to know what the word poises and I read it to him again that little section

3867
03:23:02.72 --> 03:23:07.28
I said what do you think that means and you know some little kid little little belly up front

3868
03:23:08.000 --> 03:23:13.68
Is it mean like he said something really smart? He says does it mean you keep your feelings inside?

3869
03:23:14.72 --> 03:23:16.72
And I said yes, Billy

3870
03:23:17.12 --> 03:23:19.12
That's what it means

3871
03:23:19.12 --> 03:23:21.12
Don't let the man keep you down

3872
03:23:21.12 --> 03:23:25.52
They want to see they want to give you the dumbest book you can read this book's got a couple words

3873
03:23:25.52 --> 03:23:29.04
You're gonna you're gonna have to you have to try and figure out what they mean but you will poise

3874
03:23:29.04 --> 03:23:31.92
You just figured it out Billy you said an example for everyone in this room

3875
03:23:32.56 --> 03:23:34.56
Salute

3876
03:23:34.56 --> 03:23:36.56
William

3877
03:23:36.56 --> 03:23:41.76
Yeah, that's the best man so that's Mike in the dragons get that for the library

3878
03:23:42.56 --> 03:23:44.56
This is what you did there

3879
03:23:44.56 --> 03:23:50.48
What it was my theory hypothesis you know, okay, so you're you're in I made you turn it on the next belt level up

3880
03:23:51.60 --> 03:23:53.52
Yeah, wait, okay, we're gonna say no

3881
03:23:53.52 --> 03:23:57.20
So with with with the kids when you're getting them all fired up

3882
03:23:57.52 --> 03:24:00.000
Here's what you did you didn't necessarily get them

3883
03:24:01.52 --> 03:24:04.96
You there's a difference between being loud and fired up and being

3884
03:24:05.76 --> 03:24:08.24
At attention so you got like

3885
03:24:08.80 --> 03:24:13.44
The trouble from what I understand that teachers and babysitters are way if you're looking after

3886
03:24:13.76 --> 03:24:19.04
Big grunk coaches and stuff like this looking after big group of kids is they don't they're they don't you don't have their attention

3887
03:24:19.36 --> 03:24:23.04
Yeah, they're fired up and a lot of the time with kids they're so fired up

3888
03:24:23.04 --> 03:24:25.68
That they can't give you their attention. Yeah, they're just going somewhere

3889
03:24:25.68 --> 03:24:29.36
But yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly right so what you did is you just basically

3890
03:24:29.52 --> 03:24:34.16
Wrangled like a big horse Wrangler yeah, wrangled all of that fired up in this that these kids

3891
03:24:34.16 --> 03:24:40.64
Right, you have anyway, but you got their attention so they you didn't have to like go against the grain with them at all

3892
03:24:40.64 --> 03:24:45.68
All you did was sort of funnel it funnel it towards you so all that fire. I was towards you so when it was time

3893
03:24:45.68 --> 03:24:52.64
They'll do anything you say now. Yeah, you're telling you actually you've actually seen we did super first hand and the effects lasted like weeks

3894
03:24:52.64 --> 03:24:55.44
After which is weird. I'm gonna show you both videos

3895
03:24:55.84 --> 03:25:00.64
Could the side yeah, that's right. Yeah, okay, so I'll tell the people if I haven't already I don't know

3896
03:25:00.64 --> 03:25:03.04
I'm excited okay, so red

3897
03:25:03.76 --> 03:25:06.72
Dave Burke's house good deal life good deal

3898
03:25:06.72 --> 03:25:08.72
Good for success exactly right and

3899
03:25:09.04 --> 03:25:12.32
We're leaving it's time to leave so it's like my kids my two kids

3900
03:25:13.04 --> 03:25:18.16
Your kids were not there one of my kids my youngest yes your younger youngest was there

3901
03:25:19.12 --> 03:25:21.12
Dave Burke's kids

3902
03:25:21.12 --> 03:25:24.08
Jamie and Flynn Cochran's kids and

3903
03:25:25.12 --> 03:25:29.12
Well, it was a lot. This is a lot of kids yes and

3904
03:25:29.76 --> 03:25:35.28
Jocquos there you did the exact same thing did the exact same thing with them as you did with the kids in the past

3905
03:25:35.28 --> 03:25:37.44
Yes, you would you're doing it now. They're which is good by the way

3906
03:25:37.60 --> 03:25:44.000
So you're going detached. I like it. You don't attach your given your assessment and I have the video to revisit to I have one and my wife has one

3907
03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:45.68
So my wife's one

3908
03:25:45.68 --> 03:25:51.68
She's videoing you and you're it cuts in where you're going like this you're going hook go hook go with your hands side to side

3909
03:25:53.92 --> 03:25:59.68
And the kids are trying to keep up they're like oh, what are we doing okay and slowly they start doing you're like and then you start yelling at them

3910
03:25:59.84 --> 03:26:01.84
Yeah, you're not doing it loud enough

3911
03:26:01.84 --> 03:26:06.72
Yeah, and then same thing who go hook and they all start doing they fall in light they're doing it louder or whatever

3912
03:26:06.72 --> 03:26:08.72
And you're like louder and of course they want to be louder

3913
03:26:09.52 --> 03:26:14.16
So they kids so they can they and they fall in light and they do it you're like good and then you give them high five

3914
03:26:14.16 --> 03:26:17.20
Right good job give one high five mirror like harder

3915
03:26:18.48 --> 03:26:21.44
Give one high five just to whichever random kid

3916
03:26:21.60 --> 03:26:24.08
So you say harder than they hit you with a harder high five then you go

3917
03:26:24.88 --> 03:26:26.88
Real loud and you go mean

3918
03:26:27.12 --> 03:26:32.52
Of course that gets everyone else fired up like they want to do the same thing so you're like going up from kid to kid high five

3919
03:26:32.52 --> 03:26:35.52
Saying ah, I mean it was trying to do it harder than the last kid or whatever

3920
03:26:35.64 --> 03:26:41.96
Me and one when other kids if you notice when other kids are giving you high five the ones that are not giving you high five

3921
03:26:41.96 --> 03:26:49.72
Or just watching full attention just waiting waiting for the next thing now the point of this story that made significant to me

3922
03:26:50.12 --> 03:26:52.12
Was because

3923
03:26:52.12 --> 03:26:59.88
To not even two weeks later, let me be like a week later right my son who's two my daughter who's six my daughter accidentally and my wife has this on video

3924
03:26:59.88 --> 03:27:02.96
Two because they're playing into in little dances whatever on accident

3925
03:27:03.48 --> 03:27:05.88
My daughter steps on my son's wrist

3926
03:27:05.88 --> 03:27:12.04
Just on accident when they're kind of you know in the in the scramble so my son gets up he's like he goes ah

3927
03:27:12.84 --> 03:27:16.84
And hits my daughter right and goes mean

3928
03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:21.96
What the heck that was kind of weird you know that was a weird outburst right there

3929
03:27:22.60 --> 03:27:27.36
So Michael and then but my wife clever she kind of remembered something about it

3930
03:27:27.36 --> 03:27:31.08
Right so she revisits the video that she took of you going

3931
03:27:31.08 --> 03:27:37.04
I mean so it's like a hit and then a point on the right that's what you did they hit in your version was a high five

3932
03:27:37.52 --> 03:27:41.80
Sure enough I see my son's little head watching the whole time just in the corner he didn't do any

3933
03:27:41.80 --> 03:27:49.84
I see was watching the whole thing go revisit my son daughters version same exact thing boom incident right steps on the wrist

3934
03:27:51.60 --> 03:27:55.66
