00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.66 This is Jockel Podcast number 97.
00:00:03.66 --> 00:00:06.50 With echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink.
00:00:06.50 --> 00:00:07.70 Good evening, echo.
00:00:07.70 --> 00:00:08.70 Good evening.
00:00:12.30 --> 00:00:18.000 To the master's stone Mason in the town of Mansfield,
00:00:20.50 --> 00:00:24.000 greetings in God, much beloved parents.
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000 If my small letter finds you in good health, I should be mightily glad.
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000 What concerns me, I am pretty much in health.
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000 Here in the white country, will have to die all of hunger.
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000 All is burnt, and the Russian army has carried off all subjects.
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000 As they had such a fear of us, and there is no food to be found,
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000 because nobody is to be found in any town.
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000 Whatever a house is found, it is empty and dark.
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000 Dear parents, I have to give news of our last battle.
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000 As we had already gone hungry for three days,
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000 and March day and night at five in the morning,
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000 we marched into this battle with a cabbage stump in our stomach.
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000 And we were in, in it until the evening.
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000 And then we again had nothing and could not eat for tiredness.
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000 Only cann in fire from morning to evening.
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000 God has helped me out of the third battle,
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000 also without harm, though the bullets hailed down pretty well,
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000 as if one were to take peas and throw them at someone.
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000 But none got me.
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000 The whole cavalry is lost.
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000 Now I want to write you about the Russian town of Missouri, Moscow,
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000 which is seven hours walk long and as wide
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000 and the Russians put fire to it.
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000 For four hours it burned and then it was extinguished.
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000 And we were stationed before Moscow,
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000 and I don't know whether we are going forward or back.
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000 I don't know what to write,
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000 except that you will shortly see many cripples
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000 without arm and leg and so many must die pitifully
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000 of hunger and terrible dangers.
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000 Russians appear all the time for the last battle.
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000 Let's end now.
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000 Finally, farewell and stay healthy until we speak again.
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000 Many greetings to brothers and sisters, brothers and law,
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000 and sisters and law, to the Baltans, the Crogans,
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000 and all good friends and acquaintances.
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000 And I am quite well, if only I can live.
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000 Farewell.
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000 I remain your faithful son until death.
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000 Johann Andreas Warnick.
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.000 So Napoleon, who is often praised by many, including myself,
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000 praised as a military genius,
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000 and he was one of the first military leaders to effectively utilize psychological warfare.
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000 And this included most famously,
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000 his bulletins, De La Grande Army,
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000 which was sort of an update.
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000 It was like a newspaper that was sent out
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000 while the campaigns of France were being embarked upon,
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000 and that was his media, so he had control of it.
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000 And he also controlled mail that his troops sent home
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000 and made sure that it painted a positive picture of what was happening down range.
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000 And that is where that opening letter came from.
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000 It was actually excerpts of a letter,
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000 but it was confiscated by the military of the Kingdom of West Folleah,
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000 which was a vastly state under the first French empire,
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000 which was Napoleon's empire,
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000 and the Kingdom of West Folleah, which is a German piece of land,
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000 and it provided hundreds of thousands of soldiers for the Napoleonic wars.
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000 And when I say provided soldiers,
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000 I should say specifically conscripts,
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000 which are basically slave soldiers.
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000 You have no choice, you will go and fight.
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000 And over time, West Folleah was eventually conquered
00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000 by the Russians for a period,
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000 and then some of the confiscated letters
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000 survived and ended up as historical documents
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000 that explained what was happening on the ground.
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000 And that's where that letter came from,
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000 through old Russian files, where they had this letter.
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000 And again, we make a habit of glorifying Napoleon,
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000 and I have done it right here on this podcast,
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000 which is actually pretty substandard behavior for me.
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000 Since I always try to listen to the voice,
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000 and hear the voice,
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000 and understand the viewpoint of the foot soldier,
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000 the front line troops on the battlefield,
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000 because that is where the fighting takes place.
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000 Those are the men that execute the plans of the general,
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000 and that is where the wars are actually one.
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000 And history as a whole has a tendency to forget about them,
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000 because generally, it's the admiral's
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000 and the generals that write the memoirs.
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000 But in this case, we are going to hear from
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000 one of Napoleon's grunts,
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000 a guy by the name of Jacob Walter,
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000 and he is a German conscript,
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000 who was fighting for France.
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000 So this is a guy grew up in Germany,
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000 but when Germany was became part of,
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000 and became a vassal state,
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000 like a subordinate state of the empire of France,
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000 then he ended up fighting for France.
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000 But even more,
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000 and you're going to find this out quickly,
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000 he was fighting for his own survival.
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000 So let's go to this book.
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000 The book is called The Dairy of an Napoleonic Foot Soldier,
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000 by Jacob Walter.
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000 And here we go.
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000 In the year 1806,
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000 I was drafted with many of my comrades
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000 in the military service in the conscription at that time,
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000 and was assigned to the regimen of Romeic.
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000 In the fall,
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000 I traveled with the regimen to Prussia,
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000 in the campaign which Emperor Napoleon
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000 with the princes,
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000 then his allies was conducting at that time against Prussia.
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000 And this is interesting,
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000 because I've talked about on this podcast before,
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000 the Battle of Jenna,
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000 and what happened at the Battle of Jenna,
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000 and what happened at the Battle of Jenna,
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000 is that the Prussian army was defeated,
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000 pretty savagely by Napoleon's army,
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000 and that made them make some major adjustments
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000 to the way they ran things,
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000 and that was kind of the beginning of decentralized command
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000 from the German perspective.
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000 But this guy, Walter, Jacob Walter,
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000 was actually there.
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000 Now this is what's interesting,
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000 and I go take some time to paint this picture
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000 of the way these soldiers operated back then,
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000 first of all they marched just about everywhere.
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000 And sometimes they'd ride horses,
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000 but most of the times they marched.
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000 And when they marched,
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000 what they would do is just whatever they were,
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000 whatever village they were in,
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000 they would go in and get quarters in that village.
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000 They'd go in, hey, we're here,
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000 we need to stay in your house,
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000 and we need to get fed,
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000 and that's what they did,
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000 and people allowed them to do it.
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000 I mean, bunch of people with guns,
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000 show up at your house and say,
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000 we want food and beds,
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000 you know, these people gave them what they wanted.
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000 Sometimes willingly,
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000 depending when they were traveling out of their own country,
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000 so when they were in Germany,
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000 they were in their Westphalia,
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000 the locals, as they were leaving,
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000 the locals would give them, hey,
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000 they would support you, it's a military guy,
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000 we'll support you,
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000 and then when they got into enemy territory,
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000 they would be, have to be more forceful.
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000 But here's how it starts off with him marching.
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000 We were given good quarters everywhere,
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000 which kept me always healthy and cheerful
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000 in spite of the continuous marching.
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000 Furthermore, I was only 19 years old,
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000 a fact which caused me frequently to participate
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000 in thoughtless and dangerous enterprises.
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000 I think he was getting after it as a young 19 year old.
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000 And this is another thing that's interesting.
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000 So this guy, these conscripts,
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000 they weren't permanent soldiers,
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000 they were more like reservists,
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000 where they would go and fight,
00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000 and when the war was over,
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000 they'd go back home and continue with whatever their job was.
00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000 And so that's what happens to him.
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000 He, you know, gets tasked,
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000 he's only 19 years old, boom, you're going to go fight,
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000 he says, okay,
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000 he starts going and marching.
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000 Back to the book,
00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000 in this city,
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000 it happened in my quarter that a comrade wanted
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000 to force the landlord to sing.
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000 However, he refused to do so,
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000 sitting the whole night on a bench near the stove weeping.
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000 Since this man could not sing
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000 because of his sorrow,
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000 sorrow,
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000 soldier humble wanted to frighten him,
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000 took his rifle,
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000 cocked the hammer,
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000 and shot.
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000 The bullet passed by me and another soldier
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000 and lodged in the wall.
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000 I wanted to mention this in order to show
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000 how the soldiers were running wild at that time.
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000 So like I said,
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000 when they were in their own country,
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000 they'd get good support,
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000 and everyone would take care of them,
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000 but then the further they got into other countries,
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000 they had to use force.
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000 A spy who was in the village,
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000 a spy who was a village smith
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000 was brought before the guardhouse.
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000 He had letters and orders to tell prescience
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000 of our strength in manpower.
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000 He was laid on a bench
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000 and whipped by two or three corpals.
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000 Two men had to hold his feet
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000 and two his head.
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000 His leather breeches were stretched out
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000 and water poured on them,
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000 and then he received about 150 blows.
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000 At last, he could no longer speak
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000 because he was half dead.
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000 After this experience,
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000 the smith was taking to the Threshing floor
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000 and shot.
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000 Blows with clubs also were heaped
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000 upon many innocent people in this city.
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000 So these guys are...
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000 Things turn bad real quick.
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000 Things turn bad real quick,
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000 and I can't even imagine these days
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000 where there's a lot less accountability.
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000 And you have 19-year-old soldiers coming into towns
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000 and just basically doing whatever they want.
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000 Back to the book, finally,
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000 when light fire now they're getting into a...
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000 in attack situation,
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000 finally when light firing began upon the outpost,
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000 or commanded to attack by waiting through the rampart ditches,
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000 with fan scenes, with fan scenes,
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000 to tread these in,
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000 and to scramble up the outworks by chopping and shoveling.
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000 When I stood in the ditch,
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000 each first soldier had to pull up the next one
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000 with his rifle.
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000 The ramparts were of sand,
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000 and everyone frequently fell back again
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000 because of the attack of the enemy,
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000 or just because of the sliding sand.
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000 Yet in that place,
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000 the huge cannonballs flew above us,
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000 and it was so violent that we would have believed the earth
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000 would burst to pieces.
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000 When everyone was almost on top of the earth
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000 work, the pressons were slaughtered with great vigor,
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000 and the rest took flight into the gate.
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000 Then we too wanted a game possession of the gateway
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000 in order to enter the city,
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000 but at this critical time,
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000 many of these pressons were shot along with our men
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000 by small and large guns,
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000 and the gate was closed.
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000 Since all sorts of shells and rockets
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000 broke out of the fortress like a cloud burst,
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000 we had to take flight.
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000 Those who meanwhile were scrambling up the outworks
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000 had to jump from the fortress
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000 into the mode along with their prisoners,
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000 and all the rest had to do likewise.
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000 During this retreat,
00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000 many fell on bayonets,
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000 many drowned,
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000 and many of us were also brought into the fortress
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000 as prisoners and sent away to Danzig by sea.
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000 Now it's interesting,
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000 this guy, the way he writes,
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000 the matter of fact, as to what happens.
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000 And again, this is a relatively,
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000 I'm going to take you through three campaigns.
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000 This is the first one.
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000 The last one is the campaign in the Russia,
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000 the famous Napoleon's famous March into Russia
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000 to try and take Russia
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000 and everyone knows how that story ends.
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000 It's not good.
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000 But this first one is,
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000 like I said, against the pressons,
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000 back to the book.
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000 One morning, the pressons surprised the Polish camp
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000 from the sea with their ships,
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000 as it happened before Easter.
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000 The cannon fire on the poles was so heavy
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000 that they could not withdraw fast enough.
00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000 Their cannonballs also traveled
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000 more than half again as far toward our camp
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000 as our balls did across the water,
00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000 since the surrounding swamps were frozen,
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000 and the balls could roll along on ice so fast
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000 that one ball took off the feet and legs of 10 or 12 men.
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000 Frequently both feet of the same man.
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000 During this blockade,
00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000 the pressons frequently made attacks,
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000 although every time with great losses.
00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000 One of the nightmare that is,
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000 you're standing on frozen swamps,
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000 and these cannonballs are being fired at a really low angle
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000 and just screaming across the ice
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000 and taking out 10 to 12 guys, legs, feet.
00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000 Going back to the book when I arrived in this field,
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000 I hastened to look for my brother,
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000 who was in the Lillinburg Regiment.
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000 Here we met, embraced, agreed in one another,
00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000 and joy filled our hearts.
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000 Then he took me into his barracks and gave me trousers,
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000 shirts, and several other pieces of clothing,
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000 which I needed since, as I've already said,
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000 I lost almost everything at Colberg.
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000 So, he's at the same place,
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000 almost everything at Colberg.
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000 So, he's out there, and his brothers also out there fighting,
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000 and they happened to run into each other from time to time.
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000 Back to the book, while the enemy had to defend themselves around,
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000 and in the crowded part of the city,
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000 a terrible shelling of light and heavy artillery broke in upon us,
00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000 and all of us had to abandon the positions we had taken.
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000 Large mines were exploded in the breastwork,
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000 everywhere their flu rockets, so-called pitch rings,
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000 which could be put out only with small boxes,
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000 as they fell on the ground.
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000 If anyone would, or could be an onlooker at frightful explosions,
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000 he could get the finest view at a fortress attack,
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000 which is more remarkable,
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000 which is a more remarkable sight, by far than a battlefield.
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000 The bombs and grenades, crisscrossing in the air,
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000 in such great numbers, all floating like balls of fire in the air,
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000 and exploding or bursting in the air,
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000 or on the ground with a small cannon report.
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000 The slow-assent of each shell, the fast descent,
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000 often also a collision of them in the air.
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000 All this is a sight of moving beauty.
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000 So, you get the, you get kind of a sense for how much firepower,
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000 and again, you don't really think of that very often,
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000 of how these battles would take place,
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000 and how much firepower there is,
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000 but there's obviously massive amounts of rocket fire,
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:38.000 grenades, cannons, rifle, horrible.
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000 And that's the first section that first campaign against Prussia's,
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000 relatively short, they achieved victory in that campaign.
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000 And he goes back, like I said,
00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000 he goes back like a reserveist to his normal life,
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000 and when he goes back to his normal life,
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000 survives that way for a while,
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000 or lives that way for a while,
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000 and then he gets recalled again,
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000 going back to the book.
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000 While I was working in various ways to,
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000 at my trade, after the Prussian campaign,
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000 the war with Austria broke out in 1809,
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000 and I was called into the Garrison at Stuttgart.
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000 And what this, this one is a little bit more of an insurgency.
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000 They're putting down the Tyreoli and insurgence in this battle.
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000 Relatively short.
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:28.000 But here's where they are holding up a fort, basically.
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000 Back to the book, we fired through the loopholes,
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000 and from the wall with cannon and small guns.
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000 During the heavy-shelling, a shot of man in front of the garden house,
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000 as he came in a little way forward toward the breastwork,
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000 and aimed into the loopholes.
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000 But after I shot and he suddenly fell,
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000 several others wanted to carry off this dead man,
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000 and as was often done.
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000 However, the more openly it was done,
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000 the more often other men were hit too.
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000 Finally we fired with cannon,
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000 throwing projectiles into large and beautiful garden houses,
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000 setting them all in flames.
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000 On the third day, the enemy could no longer hold out,
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000 because of the heavy artillery fire,
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000 and moved back into the mountains.
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000 So here's a classic lesson, a classic lesson of combat.
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000 If there's a wounded person, you can't run out and get him.
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000 You have to suppress fire, and that's exactly what he's saying here.
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000 He shot a guy.
00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000 Somebody came out to try and pull him back.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000 He shot that guy too.
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000 Somebody came out to pull them.
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000 You shoot that person too.
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000 What you have to do is suppress fire when someone gets wounded.
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000 As hard it is to do that, that's what you have to do.
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000 When you say it's hard as it is to do that,
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000 because your friend is wounded,
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000 you kind of, the automatic thing is to go get a real quick.
00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000 That's exactly right.
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000 That's exactly right.
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000 It's an emotional attachment.
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000 It's an emotional decision that people,
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000 most people are tempted to make.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000 Hey, Echo shot, I'm going to go save him.
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000 So I run over to save you, and I get shot too.
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000 And again, that campaign,
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000 you know, you could hear the the insurgents go back up into the mountains,
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000 and he cares on a little bit with that.
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:22.000 But the focus that I wanted to get to today was this campaign in Russia.
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000 So here we go back to the book in the month of January 1812.
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000 I was recalled to the garrison of Shornin' Dorf.
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000 And they know that they're going to Russia.
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000 They know that that's where they're heading.
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000 But they know it's going to be tough.
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000 But here we go back to the book.
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000 Here's about their attitude.
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000 I and all the soldiers were very merry.
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000 Always singing and dancing,
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000 especially since throughout the entire wordsberg country.
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000 The quarters and eating and drinking were very good,
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000 particularly because of the large supply of wine,
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000 so that everyone had his field flask voluntarily filled with wine
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000 and his pockets with cookies at the time of departure.
00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000 More over the beautiful villages on the main river surrounded by vineyards,
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000 fruit trees and grain fields, put everyone in a happy mood.
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000 About the middle of March, the army continued on its way through Saxe,
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.000 co-burg, where a wooded and mountainous region began,
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000 the pine trees were especially plentiful.
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000 So I was also thinking about this.
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000 You're a working class guy in Germany in the early 1800s.
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000 You're working your job day to day.
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000 I don't know what you do.
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000 What are you?
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000 Let's say you're a metal worker.
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000 Let's say you're a stone layer of a mason of something.
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000 Whatever your job is.
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000 But you're working hard.
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000 You're getting your paycheck.
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000 Probably not great.
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000 And then all of a sudden they say,
00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000 hey, you want to go in a little adventure.
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000 You're going to get to take what you want.
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.000 You get to go out.
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000 You're going to get good food.
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000 I can kind of sense that attitude.
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000 And it's the same thing that happens with military guys today.
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000 Myself included where you know,
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000 I'm growing up in a small town and everyone just kind of lives and dies
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000 into small town and all of a sudden there's an opportunity to go out and just
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000 get after it, live adventure and see the world.
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000 You know, that needs to say that in the Navy.
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000 You know, join the Navy and see the world.
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000 Hey, that sounds cool.
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000 Yeah.
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000 And that's kind of what this is here.
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000 Especially this guy's been veteran.
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000 He's been through some wars.
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000 Been through some tough fire fights and obviously seen some significant casualties.
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000 But at the same time, he's a veteran that he's come back.
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000 So he comes back to his, you know, like I said,
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000 I don't know what his civilian job was,
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000 but he was laying stones or pounding on an envelope,
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000 shaping metal or something like that.
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000 And all of a sudden, hey, you know what we want you to go out and live in nice
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:58.000 matters that you that you take down or that you you get quartered in and they're going to feed you great.
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000 And it continues back to the book in the city of Leipzig.
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.000 Anyone could see what was going to happen since many Frenchies as could slip through
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000 came crowding through the gates.
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000 Leipzig was packed with soldiers and I was in quarters with 150 men.
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000 The landlord to whom we were assigned put us all in one building,
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000 the former theater building, which was a hundred feet tall,
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000 a hundred feet long and sixty feet wide.
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000 Chippel rows of tables stood ready in the hall, very beautifully set and loaded with beer,
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000 brandy, butter, cheese, and white bread.
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000 After all, it sat down, everybody ate and drank while eight servants brought in the warm meal,
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000 which consisted of white soup, two kinds of meat,
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000 and several kinds of vegetables.
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000 In addition, something cold was served for dessert and drinks were served in abundance throughout the whole afternoon.
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000 We stayed here two days until the line of march formed by columns and the departure was ordered.
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:11.000 So, like I said, living the pretty good life back to the book and then we went further and came to first involved
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000 a middle-side city in Brandberg district.
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000 We were still very lively in this town, singing and living cheerfully,
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000 although we could imagine the unusual campaign before us.
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000 But everyone always believes in and hopes for the best.
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000 I also looked after my savor and made it very sharp at a turners and tempered it in fire
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000 so that it would not break off.
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000 The march was continued to pull in through the village of Reppen,
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:50.000 where the use of German language stops, and the manners and cultures made a strange impression.
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000 It was the month of May, and the air swarmed with May bugs,
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000 so that amazingly, so amazingly that it was hard to keep your eyes open in the evening.
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000 The bugs were so very thick that they darkened the atmosphere,
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000 and everyone was busy shaking them out of their face and hair.
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.000 Here it became necessary for each person to seek and cook his own provisions.
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:20.000 Although requisitioning was forbidden, so you weren't allowed to go out and just take stuff, still.
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000 But you can see things are starting to get leaner.
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000 However, everyone still had his full strength and courage would still alive in every soldier.
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000 But from day to day, privation and hunger increased,
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000 and it became necessary for the regiment to requisition and slaughter livestock
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000 so that men could have some meat in addition to the potatoes and grits which they found here and there.
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000 Bread was rare, and there was nothing at hand to buy.
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:59.000 So again, you can see as they move as they move to the east towards Russia from Germany through Poland,
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000 and there's food is becoming less.
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000 And they had left in January, if you remember, and so now it's May.
00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.000 So the weather is actually even though there's a lot of bugs, but the weather's, it's hot, which,
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000 the Russian campaign, there's one of the best defenses that Russia has.
00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000 Maybe if maybe the best defense that Russian has, and that's the Russian winter.
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000 But right now it's spring.
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000 It's springtime in Poland, so still not that bad yet.
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:34.000 And back to the book. Now the orders, now the orders let us from foreign to Miriam Poll.
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:43.000 The march went through Seaburg. The roads were sandy and dust covered, and dust covered are clothing.
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:51.000 And you're going to see how very quickly things turn for these soldiers.
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000 Back to the book, Daily The Hardships increased, and there was no hope of bread.
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:02.000 My Colonel spoke to us once and said that we could hope for no more bread until we cross the enemy border.
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:10.000 The most anyone might still get was a little lean beef, and hunger made it necessary to dig up the fields for the potatoes already sprouting,
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000 which were, however, very sweet and almost inevitable. Inedible.
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:23.000 One also heard everywhere that several men had already shot themselves because of hardship.
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000 In particular, an officer had cut his own throat on that very same day.
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000 So again, it's very interesting that way he writes, he's sort of matter of fact,
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000 but we've already have people that are starving, and they're starving, they're marching,
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000 and it's bad. It's bad enough that people are killing themselves.
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000 Yeah, kind of seem that that came out of nowhere.
00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000 Yeah, and I skipped some pages, but I didn't skip that many pages.
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:59.000 I didn't skip that many pages. It went pretty quick from pretty decent living.
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:06.000 It's two pages. It's three pages in the book, from pretty decent living, singing and living cheerfully,
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000 to we got officers that are cutting their own throats.
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000 Yeah.
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000 And this whole campaign takes place in less than a year from January,
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000 they're back by December.
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000 And they haven't, by the way, what's interesting, they haven't met the enemy yet.
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000 Right? That's what's, that's what's, that's what's going to, you know,
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000 as I'm reading this and as you listen to it, you think they haven't even met the enemy yet.
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000 They're just already, already people are dying, already people are killing themselves.
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000 Yeah, and I don't know how much this he talks about this, but he says,
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000 because of hardship, like what just, just, just,
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000 marching, marching, and starving being called being uncomfortable,
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000 privation, suffering.
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000 Straight up got too much.
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000 Yeah, and, and your, your light at the end of the tunnel is combat with the rushes and a rush in the winter.
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000 Yeah.
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000 Going back to the book, we believed that the rushes would wait, oh, oh, sorry,
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:12.000 back to the book, finally we came to the memo river where the Russian border was.
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000 We believe that the Russians would wait on the other side of the bank and attack,
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000 but nothing happened.
00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.000 Bonaparte fired upon the high points held by Russians with a few cannon and sent his cavalry across the water.
00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000 The Russians, however, withdrew after a short encounter.
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.000 And this is, this is, is so cool to hear this because this is the Russian defensive tactic.
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000 You hold, you, you don't hold the line.
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000 You hold the line of a little bit, and then you, and then you retreat.
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000 And you take, you know, you, you, you inflict some damage on the enemy on the invaders.
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000 You inflict some damage on them, and then you retreat.
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000 And then they, when the enemy attack, when the invaders attack again,
00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000 you inflict some damage, and then you retreat.
00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000 And you're just drawing them in and drawing them deeper and deeper and deeper into Russia.
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:10.000 And what they didn't expect, what they didn't expect was that what the Russians did was very smart.
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000 When they retreated before they retreated, they destroyed everything.
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000 They burned the houses.
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000 They, they killed the livestock if they couldn't take it with them.
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000 They dug the fields up, so there was no food.
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000 Because that was the standard.
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000 The standard is, as an army is a soldier in this time, you, you lived off the land.
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.000 You didn't need to supply chain.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000 You just lived off the land.
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000 Okay, we got, we'll find some, we'll hunt some meat, and that's a beard dinner.
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000 We'll dig up some, some crops that are, that we find, and that's what we'll eat.
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000 Oh, and we, for shelter, we need to carry shelter with us.
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000 We'll just stay in the houses.
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000 So the Russians, very smart.
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000 They destroyed all that.
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000 And the French were not expecting this tactic, and it was very, very effective.
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000 Back to the book on June 25, the army went over the bridges.
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:07.000 We now believe that once in Russia, we need do nothing but forage, which, however, proved to be an illusion.
00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:14.000 The town of Ponyman was already stripped before we could enter, and so were all the villages.
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000 So they, they thought they might be living high on the hog.
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000 But didn't happen.
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000 Back to the book.
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:29.000 He ran there a hog ran around, and then was beaten to death with clubs, chopped with sabers, and stabbed with bannets, and often,
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000 and often still living, it would be cut and torn to pieces.
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000 Several times I succeeded in cutting off something, but I had to chew it and eat it uncooked,
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000 since my hunger could not wait for a chance to boil the meat.
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:49.000 The worst torture was the march, because the closed ranks forced all to go in columns.
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000 The heat and dust flared up into our eyes as if from smoking coal heaps.
00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:01.000 The hardship was doubled by the continual halting of troops whenever we came to a swamp or a narrow road.
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:09.000 Often one had to stand for half an hour, then another such period, we spent catching up and judging away without food or water.
00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:17.000 So this is, this is something that anybody that's done any kind of forced road march in the military can appreciate.
00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:28.000 You come to some kind of a choke point, like let's say you got people walking down a road, and there, let's say, ten or fifteen guys are breast and just marching and walking.
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000 And you get to something where it's a choke point.
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000 So now all of a sudden only three, it's like a traffic jam.
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000 Only three people can go across this walking bridge at a time, so that means everybody that gets their has to stop.
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000 Well, the people that got their first, when they get to the other side, they keep that pace going.
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:52.000 So by the time you at the end of the tail, an hour later or a half an hour later, when you get across, you've got to now run to catch back up.
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000 And so it's just, it's painful.
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000 And of course on top of that, you have the fact that these guys have no water or food.
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000 Back to the book, during the third night, a halt was made in a field which was trampled into a swamp.
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:16.000 Here we were ordered to camp and to make fires since the, since neither village nor forest could be seen, and the rain continued without end.
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000 You can imagine in what a half numbed condition everyone stood there.
00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:29.000 What could we do? There was nothing that we could do, but stack rifles in pyramids and keep moving in order not to freeze.
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000 So it just went in a day, it went from hot, and this happens out in the desert too.
00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000 It's hot, and then all of a sudden at nighttime you're freezing.
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000 And these guys are, they get told to build fires, well guess what, there's no wood.
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000 Everything had been burned. They all they could do is stack their rifles.
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:55.000 Back to the book, we had to march further toward Dissina, where we arrived in the middle of July.
00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000 The men were growing weaker and weaker every day, and the company's smaller and smaller.
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:07.000 The march was kept up day and night. One man after another stretched himself half dead upon the ground.
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000 Most of them died a few hours later, several, however, suddenly fell to the ground dead.
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000 The chief cause of this was thirst for in the most districts.
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:28.000 There was no drinking water. There's no water fit for drinking, so that men had to drink out of ditches in which we're lying dead horses and dead men.
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:35.000 Another thing we take for granted these days, we got little pumps, little filtration pumps.
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000 You can go to a water with a dead horse in it, and you can filter that water out, or you can put an iodine tablet in it,
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000 and you're going to kill the bacteria, and it's safe to drink.
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:51.000 These guys don't have that choice. They're either going to drink this disease, ridden water, or they're going to die of dehydration.
00:33:51.000 --> 00:34:01.000 Now they get to another village, and here we go back to the book, and another well-plundered village, nothing could be found in the houses.
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000 And so, urged on by our hunger, we dug in the ground.
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:13.000 Here, I, with several others, removed a large pile of wood, which had probably just been put there.
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000 We removed this, dug into the ground, and found a covered roof of planks.
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000 There was an opening under this from 10 to 12 feet deep.
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000 Inside, there were honey jars and wheat covered with straw.
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:36.000 When we had all this, we opened the jars and saw solid white substance with the appearance of hard wax.
00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:46.000 It was so hard that one had trouble breaking off a piece with his saber, but as soon as it was put on the fire, it all melted away to very clear honey.
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000 Now I had honey to eat for a week, although without bread.
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:58.000 So, they are occasionally finding food that is deeply hidden.
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:05.000 There's a couple other instances where they find food that's been hidden by the locals, but it's not enough to go around.
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000 And you can imagine how you're feeling when you're in tired diet, it's just jars of honey.
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:20.000 Back to the book on the morning of August 17th, every regiment was set in motion, and all advance in columns against the Russians.
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000 Here, every regiment without exception was under fire.
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:32.000 Again and again, the troops attempted assaults, but because of the greater number of the Russians, we were forced back every time.
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000 On this day, since their heavy artillery stood on heights and could hit everything.
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:45.000 Finally, by night, we had made good our position on the heights overlooking the city, and the battle was discontinued.
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000 So, they attack again and again and again, but the enemy has the high ground, so they make no progress.
00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:01.000 They take a little pause for the night time, back to the book, the night time lasted three hours at most, with the glow of the sun continuing.
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000 So as soon as the day broke, we marched against the city.
00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.000 The river was crossed below the city, the suburbs on the northern side were stormed, set on fire, and burned up.
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:19.000 My company's doctor named Stubble had his arms shot away in crossing the stream, and he died afterward.
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:27.000 No longer could I pay attention to my comrades, then therefore, new not in what way they perished or were lost.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:38.000 Everyone fired and struck at the enemy in wild madness, and known could tell whether he was in front in the middle or behind the center of the army.
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:45.000 Finally, while cannonballs kept on reigning out of the city, we stormed it.
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:56.000 With the help of heavy cannon, most of the supporting peers on the high old city wall on which the Russians were defending themselves from the inside were partially destroyed.
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:03.000 We broke through the gates, pressed from all sides against the city, and put the enemy to flight.
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000 When I entered the city, we went toward the co-coistors and churches.
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000 They had many holy images and alters as ours do.
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000 The only difference was that there was no holy water.
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:25.000 So, there's so much fighting going on. It's so bad he can't even keep track of who's dying and how they're dying. They don't know where the enemy is.
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000 Eventually, they pound the Russian positions hard enough with artillery that they are able to break through.
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000 And when they get in there, they go to visit the churches.
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:43.000 And they're hoping that it can find some water, but they the Russians even took the holy water. So there's nothing to drink.
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000 Back to the book we resorted in the evening to the former camping ground.
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:57.000 Here once all the wounded men being brought together to be operated on in a brick kiln which lay on the heights above the city.
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:05.000 Many arms and legs were amputated and bandaged. It all looked just like a slaughterhouse.
00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:15.000 On August 19th, the entire army moved forward and pursued the Russians with all speed.
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:25.000 Four or five hours farther up the river another battle started, but the enemy did not hold out long and the march now led towards Meshasek.
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000 Called the so-called Holy Valley.
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:37.000 From Smolensk to Meshasek, the war displayed its horrible work of destruction.
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:47.000 All the roads, fields and woods lay as those sewn with people, horses, wagons, burned villages and cities.
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000 Everything looked like the complete ruin of all that lived.
00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:01.000 Although every day our numbers fell off considerably.
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:11.000 That line hit me pretty hard. Everything looked like the complete ruin of all that lived.
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000 And he's saying that for every one soldier that they had lost, they're finding 10 dead Russians.
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:25.000 And again, that's another thing, another tactic of the Russians. They're just going to draw you in and they've got people.
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000 Got massive numbers of people.
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:35.000 And they're willing to fight nutrition warfare and give up their people as they surrender to do as much damage to the enemy as they can.
00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000 And what they're doing is they're spreading out the logistics train.
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000 They've destroyed the support mechanism that you would use by going eating what food was in the village.
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.000 They destroyed that, they burned it all. And so now your logistics train gets completely spread out over these horrible roads.
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000 And that's how they know. That's what the Russian tactic.
00:39:53.000 --> 00:40:01.000 And then when they once they've done that, they wait for winter.
00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:09.000 Back to the book, in such numbers where the Russians lying around that it seemed as if they were all dead.
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:17.000 God, how I remembered the bread and beer which I had enjoyed at home with such an indifferent pleasure.
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000 Now, however, I must struggle half wild with the dead and living.
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:35.000 How gladly I would I renounced for my whole life the warm food so common at home if I only did not lack good bread and beer now.
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:41.000 I would not wish it for more all my life.
00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000 But these were empty helpless thoughts.
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000 Yes, the fall of my brothers and sisters so far away added to my pain.
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:57.000 Wherever I looked, I saw the soldiers with dead half desperate faces.
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000 Many cried out and despair if only my mother had not borne me.
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:11.000 Some demoralized men even cursed their parents and their birth.
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000 Napoleon.
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000 Back to the book, on September 7th, every core was assigned its place.
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000 And the signal to attack was given.
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:37.000 Like thunderbolts, the firing began both against and from the enemy.
00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000 The earth was trembling because the cannon fire and the rain of cannonballs crossed confusedly.
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:53.000 Several entrenchments were stormed and taken with terrible sacrifices, but the enemy did not move from their place.
00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:03.000 Now the two armies moved more vigorously against one another and the death cries and shattering gunfire seemed a hell.
00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000 Nine entrenchments were stormed.
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.000 The French threatened to surround the enemy from the front and finally the enemy gave way.
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:19.000 Within a space of an hour and a half long and wide, the ground was covered with people and animals.
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:25.000 There were groans and winds on all sides.
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:40.000 And that battle right there that he's talking about on September 7th, that is the bloodiest single day of all the Napoleonic wars.
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:48.000 There's about 250,000 men that attacked and there was 70,000 casualties in the first day.
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000 And so I always refer to the battle of the song where there were 60,000 casualties in the first 24 hours.
00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000 And so here we go, that's 70,000 in one day.
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:08.000 Back to the book, we moved forward and camped by a forest on a height facing Moscow.
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000 It was a wood of green trees.
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:18.000 Here we not only had nothing to eat but also no water to drink because of the high campsite.
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000 And the road through the fields was still covered with dead Russians.
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000 And this is another interesting point that happened in this battle.
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:34.000 I talked about how they destroyed everything, destroyed the fields, killed all the livestock or drive them away.
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000 And make the people leave.
00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:46.000 There's just, there are just barren wastelands. Also, the governor of Moscow, he opened up the prisons and let all these prisoners out.
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:54.000 I let all these people out of prisons, just to add to the mayhem.
00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:01.000 Now, going back to the book, Napoleon refused that peace treaty proposed to him.
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000 And that's actually, that's what he says in the book and that's actually not what happened.
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:13.000 There was Alexander. He didn't accept the peace offering.
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000 So they got, you know, hey, Napoleon said, well, you know, we made it to Moscow.
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000 Do you want to have peace? The guy says negative.
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000 You know, Napoleon was probably going to try and bargain for something, but he gets told no.
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:33.000 Back to the book and the army, which had advanced some 30 hours farther had, that further on had to retreat.
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000 Because the Russian army stationed in Moldavia was approaching.
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:53.000 Now it was October 17th and Napoleon held an army review and announced that a departure for October 18th early in the morning at 3 o'clock with the warning that whoever should delay one hour would fall into the hands of the enemies.
00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:02.000 So now they're getting told, all right, you fought hard to get here. Now we're going to retreat leaving it free o'clock in the morning.
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:11.000 From Moscow, the road led south through Mayo and toward Kaluga.
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000 Here, the humanity of the commanders began to mount.
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:32.000 The remaining troops weapons were inspected and many who did not have to weapons fairly rust-free got 12 to 20 strokes through the club until they were near desperation.
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000 Needless to say, this is not good leadership.
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:52.000 Hey, you want your people to keep their weapons squared away, but if you're actually going to beat them and make them less combat effective, you better find a better solution for your situation.
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000 Here we go back to the book, the enemy attacked us.
00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:01.000 The enemy army behind us shattered all the army core, leaving each of us then without his commanding officer.
00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:10.000 Those who were too weak to carry their weapons or napsox through them away and all looked like a crowd of gypsies.
00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:21.000 Everything was in confusion and during almost the whole night the throng had to retreat to Moshe'sick, everyone running so as to not fall into the hands of the enemy.
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:39.000 Because of these considerable losses, cannon, munition wagons, coaches and baggage wagons by the hundreds had to be thrown into the water and where that was impossible all wagons were burned, not one wheel being permitted to remain whole.
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:57.000 So now as they're retreating, they've got to, they don't want to leave this stuff behind, so they're thrown into the rivers and setting the wagons on fire as they're retreating in total disrepair and disorganization.
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:09.000 The shrieking, the firing of large and small guns, hunger and thirst and all conceivable torments increased in the never-ending confusion.
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:20.000 Indeed, even the life seemed to seek supremacy for their number on both officers and privates was in the thousands.
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:34.000 In these days, it snowed for the first time and the snow remained. The cold arrived at the same time too and the freezing of people multiplied the number of dead.
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:46.000 No one could walk 50 paces without seeing men stretched out half or completely dead.
00:47:46.000 --> 00:48:08.000 Similar situation that militaries seemed to get into is lack of good winter clothing. It happens all the time and that's what happens here. These guys are not prepared for this type of situation. They're not prepared for this cold.
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:18.000 The distress mounted higher and higher, and horses were shot in eaten. Because I could not even get a piece of meat and my hunger came to violent.
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:26.000 I took along the pot I carried, stationed myself beside a horse that was being shot and caught up the blood from its breast.
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:34.000 I set this blood on the fire, let it coagulate, and ate lumps without salt.
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:54.000 The Russians advanced and waited us at Minsk. Everyone hastily fled, canon were thrown into the water. The hospitals were nearly all left to the enemy, and as was commonly rumored, the hospitals were set of fire and burned with their inmates.
00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:08.000 All the time the greatest misery fell upon the poor sick, who usually had to be thrown from the wagons just to keep us from losing the horses and wagons entirely and who were left to freeze.
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:28.000 Left to freeze among the enemies for whomever remained lying behind could not hope to be rescued. The march had to go on, and the striking, clubbing, and skirmishing commenced so frightfully that the cry of murder echoed all about.
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:43.000 The caustic advanced upon the army from all sides. Again and again people died, and sometimes froze to death. These were people who pressed toward the fire, but were seldom permitted to get there.
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:57.000 So they died away from the fire, and very often they were even converted into cushions in order that the living would not have to sit in the snow.
00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:11.000 You've got situations where you're not only fighting against the enemy, but there are also the troops robbing and fighting each other, and in some cases murdering each other.
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:27.000 He talks about this, and I'll talk about it a little bit more. I jumped into them, and the fires, and what happened was there's so little fuel for the fires that they would form teams of six to eight guys and gather up wood, and then that team would sit around the fire.
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:54.000 So cold, and if you're not extra fire, you're going to freeze to death, but if you didn't participate in helping to build the fire, then you don't get to sit next to the fire. So if you were too weak, if you were too hungry, if you were too thirsty, and you couldn't do your carry your load, and get firewood, you weren't going to be permitted to sit next to the fire, which man you're going to sit out there 20 feet from the fire and you're going to freeze to death.
00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:09.000 After the book in every bivouac soldiers who look like specters, crept around at night. The color of their faces, their husky breathing, and their dull, more muttering were horribly evident.
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:29.000 So wherever they went, they remained hopeless, and no one allowed these shades of death to drag themselves to the fire. Usually six, eight, or ten of us had to combine to build a fire, since no other wood was to be had except rafter pieces from burned houses, or trees lying around, shattered wagons, etc.
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:42.000 And without the cooperation of the men, nothing could be accomplished. Neither did we dare to fall asleep at the fire at the same time, because no one was safe from stealing and robbery.
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:50.000 Officers were beaten away from the fire just as private's were, whenever they tried to press forward without merited claim.
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:57.000 Only mutual support still procured true friendship.
00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:06.000 So they didn't care anymore. If your officer doesn't matter, if you didn't put out and build this fire, you're not going to get close to it.
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:19.000 And I mentioned very quickly, lice, and he at one point he hooks up with a major, and they kind of become swim buddies trying to work together.
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:34.000 And here we go to the book, we came to a lumberyard and built a fire there. When the major had become somewhat warm, his subjects, and by subjects he's referring to lice, played him with unusual wickedness.
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.000 And for this reason, he asked me to kill the tormentors in his shirt collar.
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:50.000 I did it, but when I had opened his collar, his raw flesh showed forth where the greedy beasts had nod in.
00:52:50.000 --> 00:53:02.000 I had to turn my eyes away with abhorrence and reassure the master that I saw nothing, telling him that my eyes hurt so much from the smoke that I could not see anything.
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:20.000 These pests, however, were no less to be found on me, thousands of them. However, because of my constant restlessness, they could not get to the point of forcing me to treat them with flesh.
00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:27.000 So the lice is actually eating his friend, the major.
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:33.000 And lice are no joke.
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000 Yeah, body lice.
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.000 Like what kids get from school. I don't know if your daughter's had it yet, but she will.
00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.000 Well, I remember back when we were in school, it'd be like in your hair.
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000 Yeah, for sure. For sure. That's where it starts.
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000 I don't think it was seen or heard of it.
00:53:48.000 --> 00:54:00.000 And actually, I read that section to my wife because my wife, like all moms, absolutely despise lice because when they come home from school, it's just total nightmare.
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:09.000 Everything's got to get squashed into my daughter's all had crazy, long thick hair.
00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:21.000 And so it would be hours of picking through that hair trying to get the lice out when that would break out. But, you know, that's the thing is you have the treatment for your shampoo.
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000 You have you clean your clothing.
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000 And so it's gone. But what happens if you don't do that?
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:33.000 What happens if you don't do that? What happens if you don't have any shampoo? What happens if you have to wear the same clothes over and over and over and over and over again?
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000 And by the way, you can't take the clothes even off because you're free to death.
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.000 So what happens? You've got a nice little home for the lice and they start to eat. Eat you.
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000 Yes.
00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:53.000 And also, and so this whole time, obviously they're retreating. They'd been defeated and they were retreating this whole time and they're still being attacked.
00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:04.000 There's still being attacked by the Russians. Back to the book, the Russians press near and near from every side and the murdering and tormenting seemed about to annihilate everyone.
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:16.000 That day, we expected that everyone must be captured, killed or thrown into the water. Everyone fought that his last hour had come and everyone was expecting it.
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:22.000 And so they're kind of trapped. And that's what he's saying. He's expecting that everyone's dead.
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.000 We're all going to die or get thrown into the water and they get to a bridge.
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:36.000 And there's actually two bridges. One of them gets destroyed. And now there's all these guys trying to get across one bridge to get to safety. They're being attacked.
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:44.000 Back to the book. Everyone crowded together into a solid mass and nowhere could one see a way out or a means of rescue.
00:55:44.000 --> 00:56:04.000 From morning till night, we stood unprotected from cannonballs and grenades which the Russians hurled at us from two sides. At each blow from three to five men were struck to the ground and yet known was able to move a step to get out of the path of the cannonballs.
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:14.000 Only by filling up of the space where a cannonball made room could one make a little progress forward.
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:28.000 I think that has to be one of the most insane situations that I've ever heard of. You're standing in a mass of people, hundreds and hundreds of people trying to get across a bridge.
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:44.000 And there's very slow movement. You have nowhere to hide and there's cannonballs from two sides that are ripping through the people and the only progress you make is by stepping on and filling the holes of where these men have gone to the ground and died.
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:52.000 And by the way, you're starving thirsty, covered in ice, freezing.
00:56:52.000 --> 00:57:08.000 And this is always encouraging back to the book, moreover, here in this region Napoleon had left us and fled with the fresh reserve troops, herring home ahead of the army.
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:26.000 The general cry was save himself who can. So again, myself included we do a lot to glorify Napoleon, but here he is, his men are trapped and a fresh group of reserves show up and he
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:46.000 high tales it out of there with the fresh reserves. He eventually gets across that bridge and now they're just, they're just every man from self, but it's not really every man from self because they got a link up with a couple of other people to support each other, to protect each other.
00:57:46.000 --> 00:58:05.000 Because it is, it's just chaos. Back to the book, it had been the fate of many hundreds when they sat down because of weakness or necessity that their clothing had been brutally torn from them and when they could not defend themselves, they froze to death naked.
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:22.000 So now you got the choice, you know, oh, I see you, you got to stop either you're tired or you're weak or maybe you just got to stop and go to the bathroom. Well, I see you in a compromise state and I come over and just take your clothes from you.
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:37.000 And I come off you quite because I want to be warm and it's you or me. And that's there his own team that's his own team, his own team right there.
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:50.000 And it just again, obviously like I always have to do with these books. I mean, it goes on and on and on and on brutal brutal.
00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:57.000 Back to the book, by the end of December, we reached the Polish border along the memo river.
00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:06.000 Now I was free and left to myself again, as soon as I noticed the trail, I wrote as fast as I could and so now he's got a horse.
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:18.000 One day along the road, I came to a noble man, no woman's, mander house at which I asked for bread and obtained not only bread, but also butter and brandy for there was a servant there who could speak German.
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:28.000 And so that's it. I mean, almost as quickly as it all started once he gets back to Poland he gets a horse and he rides until he finds a nice mander house.
00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:39.000 And also, it's not really a concentration of troops anymore that are showing up in these towns. Now it's small groups. It's not like thousands of soldiers are coming in that need to be fed.
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:49.000 It's dozens at a time. And so there's actually the food and necessary means to support small numbers of soldiers that are coming in.
00:59:49.000 --> 01:00:06.000 And so it's, I don't want to say it's anti-climactic, but it is a little bit because once he gets back to Poland and gets a horse, it's like it's over and he gets a escapes from all that pain and misery.
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:21.000 And we get to another town I came to Ortalsburg and for the first time was given regular quarters. He was just Christmas Eve, a date I would not have known if I had not learned it from the landlord.
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:37.000 But I also washed myself for the first time, but I could not read myself of the likes. We met a column of Bavarians who were on route from Coneyxburg to the gathering place at Plok.
01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:50.000 They told us the news that the Whartonburgers too were gathering in front and that the Germans all had permission to go home.
01:00:50.000 --> 01:01:04.000 Hence, I was one of the last to come to Thorn. The same night I lodged in a house and bought some bread and wine for free quarters were not to be thought of.
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:19.000 One could scarcely creep along the streets on account of the throngs of people. Early in the morning I traveled across the bridge and saw with astonishment that the city during this year of war had been developed into an important fortress.
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:32.000 However, they had used only wooden walls and sand around the high walls. I now grew weaker and weaker and only with great exertion that I reached the city.
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:41.000 Here I reached the third convoy of our people and presented myself immediately to the commander who asked, where are you from?
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.000 From the army was my answer.
01:01:46.000 --> 01:02:00.000 You are also one of those Moscow Bums he retorted and that was my welcome return.
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:22.000 One of those Moscow Bums. So just to explain what those Moscow Bums were, they started with 685,000 men and had over 400,000 killed.
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:46.000 That's almost 60% killed. And I think what's what this book gives me is such a classic example really of not only how to act, but also how not to act.
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:55.000 So from a leadership perspective, keep your people informed of what is happening.
01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:04.000 And that's one thing that struck me about this book. Oftentimes he's had no idea what was happening, what was going on, what was the next move.
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:15.000 They did not know what was happening. Another thing, and this is clearly a lesson that we talk about all the time is, if you got to be humble.
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000 Because from Napoleon's perspective, he thought he could pull this off, right?
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:33.000 But he underestimated Russia's strength. He underestimated the time it would take. He underestimated the readiness of his own troops. He underestimated their strategy.
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:41.000 So again, lesson learned for the millionth time, be humble.
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:49.000 And then getting to this, this, this, this, this, this, that closing statement about Moscow Bums.
01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:58.000 I think that is a great reminder to treat people with respect.
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000 And we talked about this, I think it was the last podcast or maybe the podcast before.
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:15.000 That doesn't mean you have to respect people. Because if you don't know them, you can't just give away respect, but you treat people with respect, because you don't know what they've been through.
01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000 You don't know what struggles they've seen. How would you know that?
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:33.000 And so when you throw out things like Moscow Bums, and you don't know that this is a guy that's been actually through hell.
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000 Don't do that.
01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:48.000 And the last thing, you know, again, to take away from this book, for me, is to remember.
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:54.000 You know, not just you in the business world, of course, remember your frontline people.
01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:03.000 Remember what grind they're going through. Remember what it feels like to them to be out on the job site or in the factory or on the frontline doing sales.
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000 Remember what that is.
01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000 But also for everyone.
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:16.000 Remember the actual frontline troops.
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:27.000 The suffering, the fear, the discomfort, the cold and the wet and the hunger.
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:34.000 Remember that reality of war.
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:41.000 And remember that it impacts those young soldiers and those young Marines.
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:55.000 Remember them because it's really, really easy to forget.
01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:07.000 So I think that's all I've got from the diary of an Napoleonic foot soldier.
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:16.000 Pretty epic read to hear that side of it totally different from sitting here and reading Napoleon's Maxims.
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:22.000 You think about his wonderful brilliance.
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000 Bailing on his guys.
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000 Oh, fresh reserves are here. Cool. I'm going to use them to get out of here.
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:41.000 And you know, I get it. I was just reading another book. I can't recommend they give it off top of my head, but it was it was talking about.
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:47.000 You know, as a leader, you're supposed to stay alive, right? Like you can't take unnecessary risks as a leader.
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000 You can't be at the front of the assault. You shouldn't be.
01:06:51.000 --> 01:07:01.000 Sometimes you have to be, but you need to stay alive. And so maybe you could give Napoleon a little credit there for that.
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000 But maybe not, maybe not too much.
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:11.000 Yeah. So this one time on site and felt where George.
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000 Do you really want to go right now?
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:23.000 In a way because it sounds, but this, that just what you said right there, this is because this seemed what like this seems like what Napoleon was like.
01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000 Signfeld signfeld. So George this real, real kind of this guy.
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:37.000 A fire breaks out and he pushes over an old lady, some kids, you know, take to escape.
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:43.000 To escape the fire. So after the fire, there was no fire. It was just some burnt burgers or something.
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:51.000 So they're questioning him and he's like, and that's what he says. Kind of what you just said there. He's like, I had to lead these people to safety.
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000 And if you know, all his loss if the leader dies kind of thing, that's what he was saying.
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000 And what's looking at them like, oh my god.
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000 They're shaking their heads.
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000 Yeah, like, right. We saw what you did. You stepped on the old lady going out.
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000 Kind of thing. So you kind of, he's kind of that deal. I think that's what Napoleon did.
01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:14.000 Yeah, I would tend to agree with you. And it's, you know, and then in the Navy, the captain of the ship goes down with the ship.
01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000 Right. That's like at least he's the last guy off.
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:23.000 Yeah. At least at a bare minimum he's the last guy off. But sometimes he goes down with the ship because he's trying to fight it and save it the whole time.
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000 Yeah. Yeah. That's the kind of old thing.
01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000 The kind of old thing.
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:32.000 I can carry that out. But he came back from this and got exiled and everything was, you know, his life was ruined.
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:39.000 But you'd sound like he ruined a hell of a lot more lives than just his own with this experience.
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.000 Yeah. Interesting. How he kept mentioning the lies.
01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:49.000 You know, like that's good when they do that because it really does give you a feel of like, you know, you know,
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000 it's a little thing. Yeah. Yeah.
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:51.000 Yeah.
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:51.000 Yeah.
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000 But it's a little bit.
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000 It's a little bit costly there.
01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000 The boom, boom, or the hunger or the cold when it's just constantly there because you don't really think of that.
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000 You know, you think of the firefighting and the bombs and then you know, those big things.
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000 But all those little things adding up.
01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000 Yeah.
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.000 Because the lies are constant.
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000 Just constantly eating you.
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000 Is that what life does eat eating?
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000 Yeah.
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:11.000 Yeah.
01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000 Are you sure?
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000 I don't know too much about life.
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000 I just know that my wife freaks out when they come in the house.
01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000 Yeah.
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.000 Which when you got four kids,
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:24.000 there was times where we just had a, you know, a nice epidemic in the house.
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.94 I come home and it look like Ghost Busters showed up and we're securing the proper quarantine. Yeah, quarantine
01:09:31.76 --> 01:09:33.76 But you have that opportunity for these guys
01:09:36.12 --> 01:09:42.86 You pick up some of that stuff in all these books what those soldiers are suffering through you know whether it's
01:09:43.60 --> 01:09:46.64 You know jungle foot foot rot trench foot
01:09:46.64 --> 01:09:55.12 Yeah, you just your feet are getting destroyed by the weather and we get the stores on your back
01:09:55.12 --> 01:09:59.80 Just all these things all these things you like Travis Mills remember you was talking about
01:10:01.12 --> 01:10:06.10 The salt stuff on oh yeah, you're back or whatever the salt crystals forming
01:10:06.10 --> 01:10:11.28 Yeah, I say no one told me about that and I heard you know a lot of my friends have been to come
01:10:11.28 --> 01:10:13.12 No one talked about that stuff, you know
01:10:13.12 --> 01:10:20.16 They were hot sweaty for a long period of time with no showers and human don't humans are you you're not used to that
01:10:20.44 --> 01:10:24.22 You're not used to people are used to that. We're used to shower every day. Yeah, you know
01:10:24.76 --> 01:10:28.44 Fresh bar of some time to this yeah, if you're training it
01:10:28.44 --> 01:10:33.94 But you you can't get used to it's like your feet right you know some people are barefoot all the time like my son
01:10:33.94 --> 01:10:36.24 It's barefoot all the time he can sprint on
01:10:37.48 --> 01:10:42.08 Jagged rocks with no effect. Yeah, he doesn't even notice it like Tarzan
01:10:42.08 --> 01:10:44.50 So it is not quiet. Yeah with me
01:10:44.78 --> 01:10:47.56 I'm all sensitive you know the feet because I got our shoes
01:10:47.56 --> 01:10:53.44 And I try and try and harden them up when I can but when I lay they have been on the road too much my feet are weak
01:10:54.56 --> 01:10:56.56 Weak
01:10:56.56 --> 01:11:01.68 Makes me angry when I see my son sprinting across jagged rocks as if it's nothing
01:11:01.68 --> 01:11:04.96 Yeah, tough for the new girl. Yeah, that makes me mad
01:11:04.96 --> 01:11:11.70 I can't even fake it either no you don't I mean you try and act all tough when you're walking yeah
01:11:11.98 --> 01:11:18.48 Trying act like it's not hurting. Yeah, but it hurts. Yeah, yeah, I had that too weak
01:11:18.48 --> 01:11:23.52 When I moved here from Koi I had that where if you were all tough because yeah, you go barefoot
01:11:23.52 --> 01:11:26.80 When you wear sleepers all the time you go barefoot everywhere. But the person are different bro
01:11:27.76 --> 01:11:32.64 For those of you that don't know Hawaiian slipers are flip-flops, but flip-flop
01:11:32.64 --> 01:11:36.56 I wear flip-flops all the time too. Yeah, but it's totally different right but you don't take them off all the time
01:11:36.56 --> 01:11:37.76 No, so
01:11:37.76 --> 01:11:40.64 It here's to give you an idea of how common being barefoot is on
01:11:41.84 --> 01:11:46.16 In elementary school. I went to school with no shoes on before and no one said anything
01:11:46.16 --> 01:11:51.20 And if you go to school with shoes on you take them off immediately because you go run around and recess and stuff like that
01:11:51.20 --> 01:11:53.68 You don't you don't you don't ever tell you that story about my son
01:11:55.04 --> 01:11:56.08 So
01:11:56.08 --> 01:12:00.96 My son was homeschooled for a while sure and when he was homeschooled he was he would serve a lot
01:12:00.96 --> 01:12:09.04 Even by even by his standards for my standards, but one time he cut his foot on the reef
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000 And he came up to the house and
01:12:14.08 --> 01:12:19.44 My wife says you know hey go clean that out put a bandaid on it put on some socks and shoes
01:12:20.64 --> 01:12:24.16 And he says no my wife says what
01:12:24.16 --> 01:12:32.40 He says no she says hey go clean that out put a bandaid on it and put on some socks and shoes now
01:12:32.40 --> 01:12:41.84 Otherwise, it's gonna get dirty. He's like no she says hey go and put a bandaid on that clean it off put a bandaid on it put on socks and shoes
01:12:43.20 --> 01:12:45.20 And he says I can
01:12:45.20 --> 01:12:46.72 She says why not
01:12:46.72 --> 01:12:48.48 And he says I don't have any shoes
01:12:48.48 --> 01:12:54.88 So it had been since he was homeschooled and it had been a really long time
01:12:55.52 --> 01:12:57.68 And since he had had to wear shoes
01:12:57.68 --> 01:13:02.40 Yeah, and so they hit out grown in shoes so it had been months since he had had shoes
01:13:02.96 --> 01:13:06.16 No need to buy all right. Don't need those things. Why you know those things
01:13:06.72 --> 01:13:09.20 So so yeah after that it was
01:13:09.68 --> 01:13:14.16 We I did I when I got home I had to she says hey go take him to get shoes. I said why she's this
01:13:14.16 --> 01:13:19.04 You need shoes because he cut his foot on the reef okay. Well, why do you get him shoes?
01:13:21.04 --> 01:13:23.04 So the same thing
01:13:23.52 --> 01:13:24.80 Was you
01:13:24.80 --> 01:13:28.08 Barefoot just if he was just barefoot all the time and he's still there for a lot done yeah
01:13:28.08 --> 01:13:30.08 Just for his feet or tough yeah
01:13:30.08 --> 01:13:32.08 So in feet and then now
01:13:32.64 --> 01:13:35.52 You know you come to the mainland where you wear shoes all the time and
01:13:36.08 --> 01:13:41.04 We don't wear shoes in the house and you know why that's a thing and so still you know
01:13:41.04 --> 01:13:43.44 But if you have like a carpet or something like that
01:13:44.96 --> 01:13:46.96 To feet get saw yeah
01:13:48.32 --> 01:13:50.32 Bummer
01:13:50.88 --> 01:13:57.28 Well remember those little things that people out on the front lines are are putting up with and suffering through on a daily basis
01:13:58.08 --> 01:14:04.80 Yeah, kind of seems like that book escalated quickly with the hardship it did and I think it called everyone off guard
01:14:04.80 --> 01:14:10.40 Yeah, yeah again. I like to try and think about the guy the guy's back then and they're thinking oh cool
01:14:10.40 --> 01:14:11.36 You know I've been working on my
01:14:11.92 --> 01:14:16.64 Whatever crappy job I have and then all of a sudden adventure time yeah, yeah, and good food time
01:14:16.64 --> 01:14:21.52 Why I get treated like a real time yeah, and and then they roll into the Russian campaign
01:14:22.08 --> 01:14:25.28 It's no not so much it's actually the exact opposite
01:14:25.28 --> 01:14:35.84 Yeah, one second you're eating bread and butter and wine with a brandy brandy wine cheese and then the next minute you're
01:14:36.56 --> 01:14:40.56 Killing your friend for his clothes. Yeah, I did yeah, I didn't
01:14:41.44 --> 01:14:46.80 Cover some of those sections where he's getting robbed. They're gonna kill him. I mean he's only guys
01:14:47.36 --> 01:14:51.60 You know or different there's another little you know because it's French soldiers and
01:14:51.60 --> 01:14:56.56 There's some German soldiers that are on the same side, but what do you think happens when things go crazy?
01:14:56.56 --> 01:14:59.84 All of a sudden they start forming there on the gangs, right? They're gonna stick together
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.96 horrible horrible well speaking of
01:15:07.44 --> 01:15:09.44 crappy jobs
01:15:10.80 --> 01:15:15.92 Yeah, maybe you could do a crappy job of telling us how we can support this podcast
01:15:16.48 --> 01:15:19.44 Actually, I'd prefer you did a good job. I want to try to do my best
01:15:19.44 --> 01:15:22.40 Oh back to that way you were just saying the
01:15:23.12 --> 01:15:28.96 You know you form into little gangs yeah in times of did that happen Hawaii too? No on time felt no
01:15:31.68 --> 01:15:35.68 I'm gonna say anyway. No, there's this move. It's called the divide
01:15:36.32 --> 01:15:39.04 I think it's called the divide I'm pretty sure it's like this weird
01:15:39.52 --> 01:15:46.96 Movie and some apocalyptic thing happens in the beginning and everyone like retreating this apartment building retreats to the basement
01:15:46.96 --> 01:15:52.32 Where the superintendent or somebody lives and this guy is uh
01:15:53.28 --> 01:16:01.76 He's like a one of these duels day prep her type dudes, you know, and and I think he even has a manual or some he wrote a man
01:16:01.76 --> 01:16:05.68 I don't know, so they all look at but it's everybody it's like you know
01:16:05.76 --> 01:16:07.76 Apprent a girl with their her daughter
01:16:08.32 --> 01:16:12.24 You know some dudes some you know, they got the broad cross section of society
01:16:12.24 --> 01:16:16.96 Exactly right and I don't I haven't seen the movie, but I know the plot. Yeah, check
01:16:17.52 --> 01:16:23.04 But that's what that that's essentially what the movie is about right there where everyone's just we're all just people right
01:16:23.04 --> 01:16:25.60 We all live in this building. We're all kind of and then
01:16:26.16 --> 01:16:28.16 They start to just divide into
01:16:28.88 --> 01:16:35.04 teams and groups and they fight and and the harder stuff gets the more violent it gets
01:16:35.04 --> 01:16:39.52 So they end up like killing each other and all these ways like certain people have certain assets
01:16:39.52 --> 01:16:45.04 So they can offer like value to this group, you know kind of thing and it's all within like who becomes a dominant group
01:16:46.48 --> 01:16:50.64 The dominant evil group is uh is he's just two friend guys
01:16:51.60 --> 01:16:56.72 The person who lives is just the one girl only one girl lives. Yeah everyone else dies
01:16:56.72 --> 01:17:01.12 You know when we're another. Yeah, it's it's a weird spoiler alert, but yeah
01:17:02.08 --> 01:17:03.84 It's weird because you don't know
01:17:03.84 --> 01:17:10.88 Like who caused the bomb you know it all that so there's a group by a core mac macarthee called the road
01:17:11.92 --> 01:17:15.92 This is a book. It's not a move. Well, they're actually there is a movie. Yeah, but
01:17:16.64 --> 01:17:22.72 You don't know what happened there either just everything is different now and it's different and gray and dark and everything's dead
01:17:23.04 --> 01:17:24.64 There's like nothing living
01:17:24.64 --> 01:17:32.24 No plants are living nothing is living and there's humans kind of wandering and and trying to try to survive
01:17:32.24 --> 01:17:40.16 It's a great book, but yeah, but yeah, that's the the movie essentially they just kind of omit all these details like that doesn't make sense
01:17:40.16 --> 01:17:44.000 That's why the movies weird but when you think about it that's what the movies about we should book
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.96 Con Mac MacCart the the road on the website for people to
01:17:47.60 --> 01:17:53.28 Get along with the dire even Napoleonic foot soldier so people get this. This would be a hard one to get
01:17:53.28 --> 01:17:56.24 I don't know us a rare book. I don't even know where I got it from
01:17:56.24 --> 01:18:01.68 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, either somebody mailed it to me
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.40 Which I appreciate if it was you let me know
01:18:05.52 --> 01:18:10.96 Or I just had it. I don't know. I don't know where it came from my books are out of control right now
01:18:10.96 --> 01:18:14.48 Yeah, yeah, it's good man. You have a dope little collection. Yeah
01:18:15.92 --> 01:18:19.12 It's not too little anymore. Cool. Well support
01:18:19.12 --> 01:18:26.80 I'll try my best here to not do a crappy job to not do a crappy job. So origin talk about origin
01:18:27.52 --> 01:18:30.80 Origin main dot com that three can go for all the cool origin stuff
01:18:31.44 --> 01:18:33.84 Supplier of yes
01:18:33.84 --> 01:18:35.44 Jocco has supplements
01:18:35.44 --> 01:18:38.000 Jocco supplements. Krill oil joint warfare
01:18:39.28 --> 01:18:43.68 Too very good essential. I would say essential. Yeah, like if you're working out in stuff
01:18:43.68 --> 01:18:47.60 Actually somebody asked me yesterday which someone said hey on a budget
01:18:47.60 --> 01:18:49.60 God sort joints
01:18:50.72 --> 01:18:56.08 Krill oil or joint warfare. That's a hard question that might be the hardest question I've gotten on the podcast
01:18:56.08 --> 01:18:59.20 Yeah, because I honestly I take on both all the time
01:18:59.68 --> 01:19:01.68 So I don't know which one
01:19:02.16 --> 01:19:07.52 It is the better one. Yeah, I do you know what I recommended though? I said join warfare
01:19:08.80 --> 01:19:12.16 Because I know the joint warfare I have noticed
01:19:12.80 --> 01:19:15.52 specifically my shoulders jacked up and
01:19:15.52 --> 01:19:21.84 The joint warfare it was like healing so with that I said hey
01:19:22.72 --> 01:19:27.12 Go with the joint warfare. Yeah, at least to start with if you can't get both yeah
01:19:27.84 --> 01:19:33.60 For sure and I would say I could I could do muscle ups for like six months. Oh, because you're sure
01:19:33.60 --> 01:19:39.36 Yeah, that's jacked up, man. Yeah, and you know me. I don't even say anything. I just I work around it
01:19:39.52 --> 01:19:42.96 Like for a while I couldn't do any keeping pull-ups. I could only do dead-hanging pull-ups
01:19:42.96 --> 01:19:44.96 That was the same as my shoulder
01:19:45.36 --> 01:19:49.76 It was my shoulder. I couldn't what I don't know why and you know I would go see some of those
01:19:49.76 --> 01:19:55.20 I go see physical therapists and I try and explain to them what's going on and they they try and overlay their
01:19:55.92 --> 01:20:00.000 their their they try and overlay their vision of my problem into me
01:20:00.96 --> 01:20:02.96 Like for instance, it makes no sense
01:20:03.92 --> 01:20:04.96 That
01:20:04.96 --> 01:20:10.16 Kipping pull-ups would hurt but dead-hanging pull-ups wouldn't right why does that make sense? Yeah, that's what happened
01:20:10.16 --> 01:20:17.84 That's what's going on. I mean I could do ring dips, but I couldn't do ring muscle ups. I couldn't do it because it was injured
01:20:18.56 --> 01:20:23.52 So you know and I all I do is I I'm out of fire the workout is the best I can you know and I for a while
01:20:23.52 --> 01:20:28.56 I was the only doing dead-hanging pull-ups and so I would do weird things I do dead-hanging all different grip pull-ups
01:20:28.56 --> 01:20:32.40 I do dead-hanging weighted pull-ups. I did all kinds of different things to get through it
01:20:33.20 --> 01:20:35.20 But I still like to do keeping pull-ups and
01:20:35.20 --> 01:20:40.88 And eventually now I can do muscle ups again and I can it's it was hurt for that's a
01:20:40.88 --> 01:20:45.36 T-shirt for it was hurt for about six months, but I've been back in the game now for I don't know
01:20:45.36 --> 01:20:50.80 Why did you do it how did I do what the shoulder? Yeah no idea just like general use
01:20:52.48 --> 01:20:54.48 General usage
01:20:55.04 --> 01:20:56.88 Greg was Greg Curtis back
01:20:56.88 --> 01:21:02.000 Messed it up. Yeah, no, I saw me yesterday. You know how he did it? Yeah, opening the window and his bed
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.24 From his bed and his wife locked the window his wife locked the window
01:21:06.24 --> 01:21:10.72 He's telling me and I was laughing and I think he thought he might have thought I was like laughing at him like oh
01:21:10.72 --> 01:21:15.84 You're getting all kind of thing, but I was laughing at that. I was laughing at just the idea of
01:21:16.32 --> 01:21:19.52 injuring your back really bad by laying in bed
01:21:19.52 --> 01:21:25.84 Yeah, opening a window. That's that's like people telling you get after it if you weren't in bed and you know
01:21:25.84 --> 01:21:33.60 He was trying to let cool Aaron right used to hot so he's trying to get more comfort yeah more comfort than laying in bed
01:21:33.60 --> 01:21:38.80 That's irony right? That's what that is I don't even want to I want to knock on wood because like I don't
01:21:39.20 --> 01:21:44.32 I don't even say anything when someone gets injured man. I hate it because I hate being injured that's a weird thing too is
01:21:45.60 --> 01:21:47.28 When you get injured
01:21:47.28 --> 01:21:53.36 You think that injury it seems like the injuries gonna last forever. I always have that feeling like this is just never gonna go away
01:21:53.36 --> 01:21:58.32 Because you don't notice these incremental little things, but when you get injured
01:21:58.88 --> 01:22:05.52 If you remember the fact that there's tiny tiny incremental progress being made and you keep working and keep doing it
01:22:05.52 --> 01:22:09.84 Eventually it's gonna heal and you'll be joyous again. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you'll be joyous again
01:22:09.84 --> 01:22:13.04 You appreciate that too. You know like when you're out and you're like
01:22:14.16 --> 01:22:17.92 Here can remember that day when I was fully not injured
01:22:17.92 --> 01:22:22.96 Yeah, it just shows to not go train or not but then when you're injured you're like oh my god
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.60 You do what you can
01:22:25.60 --> 01:22:28.16 People ask me that all time. How do you what are you doing you can't you?
01:22:28.16 --> 01:22:32.32 Would you can't do what you can't that's what I did like I couldn't do muscle ups. Okay cool
01:22:32.56 --> 01:22:37.92 I would do ring dips. I would do other I would do every other exercise around muscle ups
01:22:38.24 --> 01:22:40.40 Except for muscle ups themselves because I couldn't do them at that time
01:22:41.44 --> 01:22:43.44 Now I'm back in the game
01:22:43.44 --> 01:22:48.80 Keeping pull ups are back. Got that joint warfare. Yeah got the jacked joint warfare. Get it
01:22:49.92 --> 01:22:56.80 And krill oil and tell me I think I think you should do both that's what that's what my opinion is and that started for me
01:22:57.44 --> 01:23:00.80 Years ago when I went on krill oil and glucose mean
01:23:00.80 --> 01:23:04.24 Condritten and now of course we have it in the glorious
01:23:05.52 --> 01:23:06.72 Super krill
01:23:06.72 --> 01:23:10.08 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah and you're supporting the podcast
01:23:10.08 --> 01:23:13.84 Which is good. Yeah, so that's a good one get that for your joints
01:23:14.96 --> 01:23:16.16 Also
01:23:16.16 --> 01:23:22.96 Gees and rash cards a lot of times people when they start jiu jitsu and this actually this this was going on since the beginning
01:23:23.12 --> 01:23:25.12 People be like what geesh it again. Yeah, yeah, and
01:23:26.40 --> 01:23:31.68 Let's be at the time I was like okay, and actually origin was one of them but I didn't know as much about origin
01:23:31.68 --> 01:23:33.52 I was like yeah, they're cool and then
01:23:34.24 --> 01:23:36.24 The one I saw was like
01:23:36.24 --> 01:23:41.52 Kind of expensive so it was like yeah origin school if you want the high-end one and stuff like that and it was cool
01:23:41.52 --> 01:23:48.64 But origin has all levels no actually not true. They don't have all levels. What do you mean if you want to get a
01:23:49.12 --> 01:23:49.92 $28
01:23:49.92 --> 01:23:51.12 G no okay
01:23:51.12 --> 01:23:56.04 Now you can't you can't get a level of level g. Yeah, you can get medium or awesome. Yeah, so okay
01:23:56.04 --> 01:23:59.84 It's good point to the medium is because the first gear ever bought was $40
01:23:59.84 --> 01:24:02.32 Yeah, see I have never been lasted three weeks
01:24:02.32 --> 01:24:12.000 I bought one for $99 and it was yeah, it was really really bad. Yeah, and I don't even know the brand
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.68 I don't know if you had a brand but yeah, it shrunk to the point where it like it fit normal and it shrunk all almost up to my elbow
01:24:17.92 --> 01:24:20.96 By the way, yeah, so to me if
01:24:21.60 --> 01:24:27.40 The next one I want to say was like 120 was like a ranger one of these brands out of not forget and it was fine
01:24:27.40 --> 01:24:33.40 Oh, I know the brand. I'm not gonna say it to hate on it, but it to me it shrunk and yeah, that cool nonetheless
01:24:34.04 --> 01:24:39.24 Now that I have a or origin gear have two of them by the way. They are way better
01:24:39.88 --> 01:24:45.72 And I'm not I know just you're looking at me like it just sounds like oh, I got this and it's way better the thing is it is now
01:24:45.72 --> 01:24:47.72 It is straight up way better
01:24:47.72 --> 01:24:54.28 Yeah, and they have different kinds of leaves or whatever, but they have and really the point there is when people ask me and if you're wondering
01:24:54.28 --> 01:25:01.40 What get get go on the website and you can see whichever you know like if you if you're like hey, I want the Cadillac one
01:25:01.72 --> 01:25:07.80 Which I recommend by the way because it's extra dope or or you know you just want the regular one. They're all good
01:25:09.56 --> 01:25:14.28 Quality all made in America too by the way and rash cards rash cards. Yeah, Pete just sent me
01:25:14.76 --> 01:25:15.72 Three rash
01:25:15.72 --> 01:25:17.72 Did you think
01:25:17.72 --> 01:25:25.40 That they just don't one or the ones American me American hands yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but wait did he send you the other one?
01:25:25.40 --> 01:25:28.36 He didn't send it to you. Which one does it has?
01:25:29.56 --> 01:25:35.32 I'll give you a hint it says it's got the chemical formulation for sodium on it. Do you have that one?
01:25:35.88 --> 01:25:37.88 Okay, you'll see it
01:25:37.88 --> 01:25:44.12 Yeah, I saw some samples, but yeah some good rash cards and they fit good to so and again
01:25:44.12 --> 01:25:51.000 I'm not gonna say the brand name, but this is a very good kind of high end combat sports brand
01:25:51.40 --> 01:25:52.28 rash cards
01:25:52.28 --> 01:25:56.20 G's I'm not gonna see the name because it doesn't matter because it's a matter of opinion anyway
01:25:56.20 --> 01:26:03.48 So I'm an influence away, but I got some rash cards and I was like cool. They looked open. I'm like cool, but you put it on and it's
01:26:04.76 --> 01:26:06.76 They just didn't work out
01:26:06.76 --> 01:26:11.40 Like I can't wear this because just how it fits and stuff like that was it baggy
01:26:11.40 --> 01:26:17.000 It was baggy, you know, I was like I tried to make a joke because like if you have a baggy rash card
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.40 Dude, you need to start jacking some sticks. Yeah, and he started I gave him that spot
01:26:22.20 --> 01:26:27.72 Raskar's baggy I agree with that, but it was weird because it was baggy in certain areas
01:26:28.28 --> 01:26:31.72 Yeah, that's weird. I don't know either way or didn't mean calm
01:26:32.28 --> 01:26:34.28 It's some cool stuff
01:26:34.52 --> 01:26:39.32 Also, it's made in America no big deal. Yeah from beginning to end here
01:26:39.32 --> 01:26:43.80 You're just funny you just said the whole thing, but the actual one of the best things about
01:26:44.20 --> 01:26:48.44 Origins made in America. That's yeah, that's awesome in my opinion. Yeah with American hands
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:55.72 Well then again, I don't know think about this what if it was all made in America? It was you know then legit from from the cotton grown
01:26:56.20 --> 01:26:59.72 All the way to the end product, but when you get it the rash card fits all baggy
01:27:00.04 --> 01:27:05.48 Serenaries, I don't know kind of defeats the purpose really well. Yeah look what happened to cars in America in the 80s right?
01:27:05.48 --> 01:27:10.20 People started buying Japanese cars because the American quality they wanted by America with the American quality wasn't there
01:27:10.20 --> 01:27:14.68 Yeah, now yeah, but at that time period yeah, you're you're
01:27:16.12 --> 01:27:18.12 Rearview mirror was gonna fall off
01:27:19.16 --> 01:27:23.88 But yeah, it's kind of like you know all I don't know if you ever had a friend or something
01:27:24.28 --> 01:27:31.56 Or maybe yourself you start like a clothing brand right? I remember back when I first started you'd see like everyone that was kind of like the thing start a clothing brand
01:27:31.56 --> 01:27:37.40 Start to get to month three start a clothing brand. Yeah, that was kind of like the joke, you know and
01:27:38.04 --> 01:27:47.08 So a lot of people they not a lot I don't say a lot of people, but some people they here, you know then you that that's kind of the the textbook process
01:27:47.08 --> 01:27:49.08 You start your brand you give away
01:27:49.48 --> 01:27:54.68 Right your stuff to key people and you know hopefully it kind of takes hold and takes off
01:27:55.24 --> 01:27:56.28 So
01:27:56.28 --> 01:28:01.80 Sometimes I'd get the shirt and the designs are cool for the time they were cool, but then when you put on the shirt
01:28:01.80 --> 01:28:06.44 It doesn't like fit character, you know because when they got the blanks
01:28:06.92 --> 01:28:08.60 Yeah, they just were like hey, I got a
01:28:09.08 --> 01:28:14.44 Cut cross hey, it's a blank black shirt. Yeah, you know what's the difference kind of thing but the thing is there is a difference
01:28:15.08 --> 01:28:17.08 The end when you put it on
01:28:17.08 --> 01:28:20.68 Bra the design can see outstanding, but if no one's gonna wear it
01:28:21.24 --> 01:28:23.24 Man, and cares so
01:28:23.24 --> 01:28:25.24 Who knows check
01:28:25.24 --> 01:28:30.76 But it is a big deal made in America from the cotton all the way to the end product that is a big deal and that's on top of the fact
01:28:32.52 --> 01:28:34.52 That the product is perfection
01:28:35.96 --> 01:28:37.96 concur also
01:28:38.28 --> 01:28:40.28 Speaking of
01:28:40.84 --> 01:28:42.84 Fitness being fit
01:28:43.56 --> 01:28:46.60 Where we talking about being fit not really, but you go with it
01:28:46.60 --> 01:28:48.20 Yeah
01:28:48.20 --> 01:28:52.20 Yes, oh, yes, we were a muscle ups and joint warfare that's okay. Yeah sure, sure
01:28:52.60 --> 01:28:53.96 so
01:28:53.96 --> 01:28:55.96 kettlebells them into I
01:28:56.68 --> 01:28:58.68 Think
01:28:58.68 --> 01:29:02.44 That this is just me because I'm spoiled but the kettlebells from on it
01:29:03.56 --> 01:29:08.12 And you know there's like copycat brands you know they do that. I'm not saying with kettlebell specificity
01:29:08.12 --> 01:29:09.40 Are they copycat?
01:29:09.40 --> 01:29:10.44 Artistic
01:29:10.44 --> 01:29:15.32 I don't know so here's the thing I don't I don't know if there's their specifically copycat
01:29:16.12 --> 01:29:20.92 Because there's other ones yeah for sure there's like a skull one and like this this other ones
01:29:20.92 --> 01:29:24.92 Hmm, but if my head was a kettlebell how much would it weigh?
01:29:27.64 --> 01:29:29.000 I'm a no-girl
01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.36 80-eight pounds
01:29:30.36 --> 01:29:35.64 I love the do the heavy one. Yeah, I saw one that's like dumb, maybe like it's dumb
01:29:35.64 --> 01:29:39.80 Over 103 yeah, it's like 200 something pounds. Oh, that's big. Yeah
01:29:40.36 --> 01:29:44.92 They go on someone sent it to me into it. Oh, I thought they sent it to you in real life
01:29:44.92 --> 01:29:46.92 I'm gonna take it from your house
01:29:46.92 --> 01:29:50.36 But you know them man. I bite like when um
01:29:51.56 --> 01:29:57.64 You know okay, so what how I did it was I got the the champ rate. It's like 35 pounds or something like that
01:29:57.64 --> 01:30:00.84 So I get two of them and that's when I started kettlebells
01:30:01.56 --> 01:30:05.56 So they're like start starting lighter and like so they need like 35 dude
01:30:06.20 --> 01:30:10.84 Yeah, but whatever wait is that too late? Not light enough not too light. Oh
01:30:10.84 --> 01:30:16.84 I when I started I was like this is appropriate I got to be careful you're in with this because I had never really done it
01:30:16.84 --> 01:30:20.92 I put it up and you know so I'll stay in safe and I was like cool formulated a good workout
01:30:20.92 --> 01:30:24.92 Now it's time to get the bigger ones, right? So I went up to there out of the one I wanted
01:30:24.92 --> 01:30:28.92 So I went all the way up to the world which is like 62 pounds. That's good
01:30:29.64 --> 01:30:33.64 So I'll start doing that with that got good at that boom boom boom
01:30:34.84 --> 01:30:36.84 so
01:30:36.84 --> 01:30:38.84 But keep in mind. I'm getting them
01:30:38.84 --> 01:30:44.36 From on it like I don't I have the luxury of getting like the good ones, you know
01:30:44.36 --> 01:30:45.88 I'm all spoiled
01:30:45.88 --> 01:30:52.36 So I'm over here like I'm about to say everyone should have the design one because it's like cooler and I don't know you get kind of
01:30:52.36 --> 01:30:55.000 You know how like when you get like a new cool rash guard
01:30:55.40 --> 01:30:59.88 Right something with a cool design on it. You want to wear it and use it, you know you know
01:30:59.88 --> 01:31:02.84 I'm saying it's kind of that you get that you get them all the time
01:31:02.84 --> 01:31:06.52 That kind of stuff. Yeah, you whatever. Yeah, she did. Yes, you do anyway
01:31:06.52 --> 01:31:10.92 Yeah, primal bells zombie bells and
01:31:11.40 --> 01:31:15.48 Legend bells those are the ones cool jump ropes on there too by the way
01:31:16.20 --> 01:31:20.92 Another fitness stuff interesting fitness stuff and um again the kettle bells
01:31:21.80 --> 01:31:25.000 I recommend the kettle bells but like me start light
01:31:26.12 --> 01:31:28.12 Don't swing and hit your shin
01:31:28.44 --> 01:31:32.12 Something that you can get in check yourself up. Yeah, there's some technique involved
01:31:32.12 --> 01:31:40.04 Yeah, and you don't recognize the momentum of swinging a kettle bell is a real thing yeah, and then it only weighs 35 pounds in your case
01:31:40.28 --> 01:31:45.32 When you swing it to the top of and then you have to stop that thing. It's not weighing 25-35 pounds anymore
01:31:45.32 --> 01:31:48.92 It's got momentum yeah, and then when you got so difficult for us
01:31:48.92 --> 01:31:51.56 Yes, so you know the one where it's like a
01:31:52.04 --> 01:31:56.60 regular snack. I think it's not a snatch but the clean. Yeah, you know you go up and it's yeah
01:31:56.60 --> 01:31:58.60 They call the rack position right? Right
01:31:58.60 --> 01:32:02.60 So even that I've seen it done so I'm like oh, I can do that. I'll just use it light
01:32:02.60 --> 01:32:08.44 But I'm doing it wrong. I'm like flipping it up where it lands on the back of my wrist and then it like pulls my shoulder back
01:32:08.76 --> 01:32:13.72 I'm like how do they do this? I was like, oh, I just got to ease but then I looked it up on YouTube the actual technique
01:32:14.44 --> 01:32:20.28 And then I'm like, oh, okay, you know, I must chip my two the other day with two front squats with the kettle bell
01:32:20.84 --> 01:32:27.08 Okay, I don't know. I just like lifted it up really hard because I was going from the picking it from the floor
01:32:27.08 --> 01:32:32.52 Tech up to the to the position to start squatting and I like did it so hard that I hit my front tooth
01:32:32.52 --> 01:32:34.52 Yeah, you
01:32:34.52 --> 01:32:36.52 Idiot straight up can't yeah
01:32:36.52 --> 01:32:39.88 Rather thing yeah, they can mean to just be careful. That's the point
01:32:40.20 --> 01:32:46.12 Anyway on it calm slash jockel check them out those are cool ones. They have the regular ones too, but I don't know man
01:32:46.20 --> 01:32:48.84 Once you have the design when you can't go back my opinion
01:32:49.56 --> 01:32:54.68 Not that I have any basis for comparison because I've never had the normal ones, but I've seen them in other gyms
01:32:54.68 --> 01:32:57.48 Used them before and it's not to say my opinion
01:32:58.36 --> 01:33:02.20 Also if you want to get this book the diary of

01:37:51.72 --> 01:37:55.16 You're on the program now you're waking up early now you're
01:37:55.96 --> 01:38:01.48 Worked I got to work out program five days. I don't know three notes interesting use the word program. This is interesting
01:38:03.64 --> 01:38:05.64 life
01:38:06.20 --> 01:38:10.36 and the Delta Ptune Commander Seth Stone back in the day
01:38:10.36 --> 01:38:11.88 Day
01:38:11.88 --> 01:38:17.72 They like asked me for like what I did for workouts. Yeah, and I wrote out my workouts and it's actually
01:38:18.76 --> 01:38:22.20 Loosely very in they're in the discipline equals freedom field manual
01:38:22.60 --> 01:38:26.84 But when I gave it to him it just said at the top of the thing it said the program
01:38:27.88 --> 01:38:33.56 Yeah, actually I really liked that expression and I've been using it from it's like one of those thinking how you always say
01:38:33.80 --> 01:38:37.16 Discipline will not allow that. Yeah, I'll say I'm on the program. Yeah, yeah
01:38:37.16 --> 01:38:40.36 Well, I don't even know what program is just a month program. Yeah
01:38:41.72 --> 01:38:43.72 The program
01:38:43.72 --> 01:38:47.96 Exactly right so if you're on the program which really life is you should be on the program
01:38:48.36 --> 01:38:54.12 Yeah, if you're not you're just like what you're like short term. You're not on the program
01:38:54.12 --> 01:38:59.16 We know that yeah, yeah, yeah, it's bad and sometimes you don't even realize that you're not on the program
01:38:59.72 --> 01:39:03.000 I think that's the problem you don't even realize you're not on the program
01:39:03.40 --> 01:39:06.76 Yeah, for if you've never been on the program then you know that you're not on it
01:39:06.76 --> 01:39:10.44 Yeah, it's like what it was J.P. call it like in in unconsciously
01:39:10.44 --> 01:39:15.40 Come in competent or something like that. You know, he has all the things all the psychological states in
01:39:16.28 --> 01:39:19.72 Learning I don't know either way if you don't know you're not on the program
01:39:19.72 --> 01:39:22.84 You don't even know what you don't know kind of thing. Oh, that kind of thing anyway
01:39:24.36 --> 01:39:29.96 Back to the program if you're on the program, but you experience those days those moments of weakness
01:39:29.96 --> 01:39:35.56 And you want Jocco to get you through them help you through them like a little spot
01:39:35.56 --> 01:39:38.52 You're not gonna take over, but as a spot
01:39:39.40 --> 01:39:42.76 You listen a psychological warfare for your moment of weakness and it goes by
01:39:43.48 --> 01:39:49.24 Situation right way enough. There's like waking up one. There's a missing workout one
01:39:49.24 --> 01:39:53.88 There's procrastination one. They're all these what it is. It's an album with tracks
01:39:54.60 --> 01:39:58.12 Each track is for each weakness that you may or may not come across
01:39:58.12 --> 01:40:06.12 That's good. Yeah, so as we got into and that a lot of people like that album
01:40:06.12 --> 01:40:09.64 Yeah, and so when Dispinnie was freedom field manual
01:40:10.60 --> 01:40:12.60 Was being created
01:40:13.40 --> 01:40:16.84 the the normal option is you publish books on
01:40:17.72 --> 01:40:18.84 audible
01:40:18.84 --> 01:40:20.84 dot com and
01:40:20.84 --> 01:40:26.84 Then they put together the book with chapters that you can listen to through the audible app. It's very
01:40:26.84 --> 01:40:28.84 Confined to that
01:40:29.56 --> 01:40:33.08 so for the field manual I I
01:40:34.04 --> 01:40:39.32 The way the field manual's written. It's not written like a book. It's more like an album
01:40:39.72 --> 01:40:41.56 Yeah, that you'd need to use with tracks
01:40:41.88 --> 01:40:44.28 So anyways to make a long story short
01:40:44.76 --> 01:40:48.28 We are gonna make another psychological warfare album, but in the meantime
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.28 We put out
01:40:50.28 --> 01:40:56.36 Dispinnie goes freedom field manual which is the book that just came out and if you're looking for an audible version of that
01:40:56.36 --> 01:40:58.36 You have to go to iTunes
01:40:59.16 --> 01:41:01.16 Amazon music
01:41:01.16 --> 01:41:03.16 Google play
01:41:03.16 --> 01:41:09.88 Everywhere that they sell M p three tracks albums with tracks and that's where you can get this clinicals freedom
01:41:10.44 --> 01:41:16.52 Field manual audio version and that that one makes a lot more sense though with with it this way
01:41:16.52 --> 01:41:21.64 Oh for sure because it is like a manual. You know like yeah, but yeah, and the thought was I
01:41:21.88 --> 01:41:25.64 Didn't want to put it on an audible book the audible
01:41:25.64 --> 01:41:30.92 Format because then people can't put it on their alarm clock. They can't they can't just jump through to listen to that track
01:41:30.92 --> 01:41:36.12 They can't put it into their playlist while they're working out. Yeah, so therefore not use not not good
01:41:36.12 --> 01:41:40.68 Not as you so yeah, so I know we're not gonna sell as many because when it's linked right there on the website
01:41:40.68 --> 01:41:42.36 I don't Amazon people can click right to it
01:41:42.36 --> 01:41:47.56 So we're not gonna sell as many but it's better anyways doesn't matter. Yeah, I'd rather put out good product
01:41:47.96 --> 01:41:48.92 Yeah
01:41:48.92 --> 01:41:53.56 That's my concern and especially when you're referring to it because that's really what a manual does your money
01:41:53.56 --> 01:41:55.56 To be
01:41:54.92 --> 01:41:56.52 Autable
01:41:56.52 --> 01:41:59.32 No, because think of the link would be right there, you know because how are you people?
01:41:59.32 --> 01:42:01.32 So okay on Amazon
01:42:01.32 --> 01:42:04.96 It says formats for the book, you know hard to cover and then
01:42:05.68 --> 01:42:07.72 Kindle and then audible
01:42:07.72 --> 01:42:12.20 Mind doesn't have that so people can't click on it and they ask me they've been asked me on Twitter
01:42:12.20 --> 01:42:15.52 When's the audible color are you gonna do an audible one? I just have to respond everyone
01:42:15.52 --> 01:42:16.96 It's on blah blah blah blah
01:42:16.96 --> 01:42:19.12 Gotcha, yeah, so again
01:42:19.12 --> 01:42:25.84 We're just I'd more concerned that people that have it can utilize it properly. Yeah, and I use all
01:42:26.36 --> 01:42:28.56 For sure it do but not as much
01:42:28.96 --> 01:42:34.32 I use Kindle that's where it looks that's actual like reading part of it. That's a long story, but
01:42:35.20 --> 01:42:37.20 This with the tracks
01:42:39.04 --> 01:42:43.28 It is better because when you want to refer to you know like it's like okay
01:42:43.28 --> 01:42:48.60 I want to go to the martial arts part right that you know all this so these other parts when you want to refer to it
01:42:48.60 --> 01:42:53.16 It's gonna be I'm thinking back with the audible format. It's gonna be harder to be like okay
01:42:53.16 --> 01:42:59.52 You can find it you're not gonna enjoy doing that effectively. Yeah, but it is good to you know listen to
01:42:59.52 --> 01:43:03.60 Listen to one whole time in there for sure. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, hit it up
01:43:04.32 --> 01:43:08.04 Yeah, but it does make more sense when you think about the whole scope
01:43:08.20 --> 01:43:15.44 Yeah, but this link was for you don't feel manual so if you get the opportunity to tell people that and tell them because I can't tell everyone
01:43:15.44 --> 01:43:19.72 I tried yeah, but it's where you can find it here's it here's the thing ultimately
01:43:19.72 --> 01:43:24.08 It's not hard to get I mean, it's no it's not hard to get it's just not on the same
01:43:24.08 --> 01:43:28.16 It's not where you'd expect it and people expect to find things where they expect to find things yeah
01:43:28.16 --> 01:43:30.16 That's so we've thrown them a curveball
01:43:31.04 --> 01:43:36.92 You know, but it's it's like I said to produce something that would be
01:43:37.64 --> 01:43:38.64 less
01:43:38.64 --> 01:43:42.08 usable by people in the man of that they want to use it
01:43:42.08 --> 01:43:48.28 Or make it a little bit harder to find like I said maybe not as many people can buy it because they won't find it
01:43:48.28 --> 01:43:51.72 I don't care I'd rather have the people that really want it get to use it the way they want to use it
01:43:52.32 --> 01:43:58.48 So that's how I wrote the slowest curveball in the history of curveball. Yeah, here get it on
01:43:58.48 --> 01:44:00.48 Yeah, here you have to do an extra click
01:44:02.88 --> 01:44:07.36 You'd be surprised how many people asked on social media when it where when it's coming out
01:44:07.36 --> 01:44:13.72 Oh, right in the audio format. Yeah, that does make sense though especially if you're used to listening for audio books
01:44:13.72 --> 01:44:15.72 Then you're like, okay, I want to do the book, right?
01:44:15.72 --> 01:44:21.28 Where's it? It's totally makes that incredible curveball. Yeah, that is a curveball. That's true. I do get it
01:44:21.64 --> 01:44:30.000 Hey while you're on Amazon also you can get Jocca White tea which tastes good and will guarantee you a deadlift of 8,000 pounds
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.36 Some other books you get on there are way of the warrior kid
01:44:36.08 --> 01:44:41.48 That's for kids that want to get after it or even if you want your kid to get after it
01:44:41.48 --> 01:44:46.76 You want to be smarter stronger better you want to eat healthier get him that book
01:44:48.16 --> 01:44:54.72 Awesome feedback on that book which is some of my favorite feedback is pictures of kids reading way of the warrior kid doing pull-ups
01:44:54.72 --> 01:44:57.000 I saw and doing pull-ups and doing GJ2
01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.80 And doing flashcards and their little book reports. I like seeing little book reports
01:45:02.20 --> 01:45:06.20 Here's a member like when you do a book record report when you're seven years old
01:45:06.20 --> 01:45:10.40 It's kind of a big deal. It's like you're getting published for the first time as an author
01:45:10.56 --> 01:45:15.96 You like it. Oh, I wrote this this is my assessment of the book way of the warrior kid
01:45:15.96 --> 01:45:20.12 Probably the most important thing has ever been written check it out and I also drew a picture
01:45:21.40 --> 01:45:25.60 You know what I mean that's uncle J. Right there. You can't hardly tell cuz doesn't look anything like him
01:45:25.60 --> 01:45:27.60 But it's supposed to be uncle J
01:45:27.60 --> 01:45:34.36 Are not my thing over here, but yeah, I like seeing those little things. We got the book extreme ownership written by myself
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.36 And my brother, Dave Babin and it is about combat leadership
01:45:41.92 --> 01:45:45.32 Discipline because freedom field manual. Yes, the book that just came out and
