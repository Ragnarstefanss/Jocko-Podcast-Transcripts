00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jockel podcast number 336 with echo Charles and me, Jockel willing. Good evening echo. Good evening.
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:25.000 So we've done a lot of reading and discussions and interviews on this podcast about the strategies and tactics from leadership, from human nature,
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000 that I've seen or I've seen others use or I've used myself.
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000 And you know, this is something that I've noticed lately is, and this is something I used to see in the sea of things.
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000 And now I see it at that song, in front as well. Where I can sit there and discuss something with someone,
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000 and think that they understand how to utilize that lesson immediately.
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000 So I explain something to someone and I think, oh, okay cool, you know, they get it now, right?
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000 And they'll nodding their head and they'll kind of even give me the readback of, you know, what the, what the principle means.
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000 And so I think they get it and it seems pretty obvious from my vantage point, but, but it isn't always that obvious to everybody.
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000 And it can be very hard to see things when you're observing them for the first time.
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:31.000 So a lot of times I like to try and show a tactic or a technique or a strategy or a procedure from a different angle from a different perspective.
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:40.000 And that's, you know, in order to try and convey that message to someone from a different vantage point where they may be can understand it better.
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000 And I think I have become biased toward giving someone else's perspective. Someone else's example.
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000 And I think that bias comes from the fact that I already know my perspective.
00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:09.000 Right? So I already know what I think, so I enjoy, or I want to give someone else's perspective of a strategy because I find it easier to do it.
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000 I find it interesting because it's someone else's, because I already know what's inside my own head, right? I already know what's in there.
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:28.000 That being said, when I did the first interview I ever did in my life, what's with Tim Peris, and he asked me if there's anything that I was world class at.
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000 And of course I said world classes are very strong.
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:44.000 Fraze to you, right? And he said it is a strong phrase. And I, so I told him I didn't think I was world class at anything which I still believe I'm not world classed anything.
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:58.000 But then I don't know if you reframe the question or if I just kind of reframed it in a way that I could appropriately answer it. And I said something long lines of if I had to say that I had some skill sets that help me.
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000 I think that those skill sets would be number one, being able to take complex things and make them simple.
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000 And then being able to communicate those things in a simple way that other people can understand.
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.000 And then number two was the ability to detach myself mentally and emotionally from whatever situation I'm in.
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000 And I believe that allows me to see it more clearly.
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000 So those are the two things that I think helped me out throughout my career and that I might be decent at doing.
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:48.000 So I wanted to talk through some principles that we reflect on a lot, but in a more pragmatic way, just to ensure, or at least to help everyone put some of these principles to use in our current environment.
00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:00.000 And I've also been thinking about talking about how some of the principles that I talk about apply to what is going on today.
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000 This is not, no, what I don't want to do is do some kind of a current events thing.
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000 This is the greatest news story. And this is because I don't, to me that's not, that's not going to last long.
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.000 Right, people need, if you use a current day example that takes some, you have to understand the backstory behind this news thing so you can apply it.
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:29.000 I'm not really looking to do that because I want somebody to be able to listen to this in six years and say, oh, there's a good, there's a good angle I didn't see before and this is going to help me with my leadership situation that I'm in right now.
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000 Or it's going to help me with my life, the way I'm in right now. It's going to help me get through overcome this challenge that I'm facing right now.
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:43.000 So to make it a little bit more evergreen is the term, right, am I using what is an industry terminology evergreen?
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:52.000 I learned evergreen from you. So I did you evergreen means you can listen to this podcast in 10 years and still make sense.
00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:03.000 You're not referring to some random, you know, TMZ news story that just came out and everybody's high bonnet.
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:18.000 But I think we can remain or maintain the evergreen aspect of the podcast and still put in some some of the current events that are going on right now or at least some of the
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:33.000 more outstanding current events and you know some of this have done on unraveling with Darryl Cooper. I know we did Afghanistan. We've talked about Ukraine. So there's things that he and I hit on that podcast to
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:45.000 kind of discuss from my perspective what's going on with these situations and even those are difficult because they changed so rapidly things changed so rapidly.
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:56.000 And I was just having a conversation with about about this with J.P. this morning about, you know, he served me say a million times at the first report the first report so it's wrong.
00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:06.000 And he was, you know, going through situation he's like, hey, is the first report always wrong? I said, yeah, let me refraise that it might not be wrong, but it also might not be right, but you can't just trust.
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:17.000 I might need to modify that a little bit when I say you can't trust the first report because if you call me panicked saying, I think the house is on fire right or the house is on fire the house is on fire.
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:30.000 I can't trust that. I have to put it into my calculus, but look, there could have been a smoke bomb that the teenagers threw through the window and it looks like the house on fire with houses on fire right or the house could be on fire.
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:43.000 So it could be right it could be wrong. What I do know about the first report is I can't trust it 100% unreliable. It's unreliable. So I might need to gather additional information.
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000 So speaking of these topics and speaking of something that comes up all the time.
00:06:50.000 --> 00:07:00.000 And that I call a superpower is the ability to detach.
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000 And this, some people automatically get uncomfortable with that because when I say detach, they think, oh, you told me you shouldn't have any emotions at all right.
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:22.000 And it is talking about detaching from your emotions. It can also mean physically detaching from a situation, but detachment is a superpower. We'll get to the emotional thing and how much you should detach and how much is too much.
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000 I think one of the clearest displays of detachment and how powerful it is.
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.000 Well, one of my wrote about leadership strategy and tactics, my first platoon doing the clear and the oil platform, but I had that other situation where I was with Seth.
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000 And we were, he had taken over his task in a commander.
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000 And when he took over his task in a commander, he broke his neck.
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000 Thank God he wasn't paralyzed. So Seth Stone was one of the two commanders in tasked bruiser.
00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:04.000 Now he's took over as the tasked commander and he's going through his pre-deployment work up. And I'm in charge of training for all these seal platoons and taskings getting ready to deploy.
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:14.000 And Seth doing a ship boarding where you climb up ladders on two ships from smaller boats.
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:26.000 The guy he was the last guy to be climbing the ladder because he's the task commander, so he's not going to be the first guy on deck, right? Because he's sort of taking a step back. He's supposed to be detached. So he's going to be the last guy that goes up.
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000 And as he's going up, the person above my right, let me refer to that.
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:43.000 Right as he was about to start climbing the ladder, one of the other guys fell off the ladder and landed square on top of Seth's head from a fall of about 20 feet. And it broke his neck.
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000 His spinal cord was intact. Thank God.
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:56.000 So now he's in a big neck brace. And he, but he can still walk around. And his, his task unit is now going through our land warfare training.
00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:07.000 So he's out there observing because he can't participate. And as he's participating or as he's observing, and I'm standing with him observing. And it's one of these crazy training exercises.
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:23.000 There's total mayhem going on. There's freaking explosions going off. We're using this high speed laser tag system. There's dead people everywhere. Again, this is training. So they're not actually dead. But they're, they're, they're laser tag system is saying that you're dead.
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:31.000 So there's body strewn all over the place and no one's moving and no one's making any calls. It's total disaster. And they're in in a ravine.
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:44.000 And the enemy in quotes is in an elevated position and they're just tearing up this Seth's task unit. And Seth, he looks at me. So I can't tell him what to do. I said no.
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:55.000 I said, just let him figure it out. And another 30 seconds go by. More guys get shot with laser tag. Let me help him. And I go, not yet. Another 30 seconds go by. More guys get shot.
00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:07.000 And mind you, his guys are in this ravine. We're actually in the ravine with them. Now, they're kind of prone position or maybe on their knees and we're standing up. But we're in the ravine with them.
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:18.000 And finally, he says, he, more guys get shot. He goes, let me help him. And I go, all right, go ahead. And he grabs a random dude, not a leader, just a random guy.
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:31.000 And he says, I remembered exactly what he said the other night. He said, do I add, which is, which is the most broad, the most broad instruction to give someone.
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:40.000 Because no one's making any decisions. And an eye add is an immediate action drill, which means when you have a play in football, what's a play in football? Tell me like a play right now.
00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000 That you guys used to run. That you were a part of. 38.
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000 Okay, so 38 sweep. So now everybody knows what to do when you call that. Give me another one.
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000 41 sweep. Okay, 41 sweep. Now everyone's doing something a little bit different, but we're making adjustments. So you literally have plays like that.
00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:05.000 And you would say if you were going to tell your football team, you'd say call a play right? What Seth was saying was, do I ads, which is the same thing as saying call a play.
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000 So he just grabs a random dude and says, hey, and some probably something new guy or one cruise wonder like all freaked out because everyone's getting shot.
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:24.000 And you know, Seth gets into this face like, do I ads? And the kid looks up at Seth and's okay. And he makes a call.
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:33.000 Whatever, whatever, 38 sweeper, 41 sweeper, peel left peel right shift left shift right whatever the call was.
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000 This kid actually makes a call and almost immediately the problem solved, right?
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:47.000 Almost immediately they start executing this play and people start putting down cover fire. Other people start to move in it and it solves the problem.
00:11:47.000 --> 00:12:00.000 And as they get out of the area and get out of the kilzone, Seth looks at me and he says, it's so easy to see what to do from way up here.
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000 And let me remind you, way up here in that situation was simply that we were standing up.
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:20.000 Like we were in some elevated position, we weren't in an aircraft flying round over. No, we could just see a little bit more. And by the way, the position we were in was a tactically sound position.
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:33.000 So just by looking around and not getting tunnel vision and detaching whatever it is, probably 20 inches higher than the other people because they're on their knees and you're standing up.
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:42.000 So you got like what, maybe two feet of additional altitude and you can see everything. And I looked at him and I said, well, I said something long.
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:49.000 That's what we're not, we're with them. We're not way up here. We're 24 inches above them.
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000 And he's like, oh yeah, and I said, but you're looking around, your detach. He says, oh yeah.
00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:03.000 And then I said, you remember when we went through this training and he says, yeah, and I said, this is what it was like for me all the time.
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000 And he had a look on his face of sort of recognition kind of like, oh dang.
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.000 So all the confusion and chaos that was going on. I was always looking at like, okay, uh, peel off, you know, shift right swift, what a swing 32.
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:30.000 What it was really easy to make the cause because you're looking at it and you can see it. And that is the, that is the power of being able to detach and it is.
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:40.000 You would think that now this is where this is why I'm talking about this stuff right now because you would think if I explain that to you, you go, okay, cool. Thanks, Jockel. Now I'm going to detach right right.
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000 That's what we would hope for.
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:50.000 But there's a problem. It's not that easy. In fact, this can be very difficult to do.
00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.000 So here are some of the mechanics of being able to detach.
00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:04.000 And some of these are a little bit like training wheels, a little bit like like learning aids that once you get good at it, you won't need to do it anymore.
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:14.000 But you should remember, anyways, because there might be some situations where shit really starts going sideways and you have to go back, put your training wheels on and kind of keep put, get it back together.
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:23.000 So one of the first training wheels is take a step back, a physical step back.
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:33.000 A physical step back. This is going to change your perspective. It changes your perspective perspective and here's, here's a little like a little.
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:44.000 A little extra advice. And it's weird to say this. Lift your chin up and look around.
00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:52.000 And the reason I say lift your chin up is because when you lift your chin up, you're changing your perspective a little bit, right?
00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:01.000 Even if it's only by a half an inch when you lift your chin up, you're kind of opening up yourself. You're opening up to new ideas.
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.000 It's the opposite of a fight stance. What are you doing here fight? If you're going to get a fight, you put your chin down, you put your hands up.
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000 So in this situation, and again, this is like a non-threatening situation.
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:22.000 So if you're coming at me, if you're like some kind of hostile or unknown and you're coming at me and you're confronting me, obviously I'm not going to lift my chin up and put my hands down.
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:31.000 That's totally different. What I will do is keep my chin down, lift my hands up. I will step back. I will create space so that I can see more of what's happening.
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000 Because I don't know you got buddies. You know, I don't know if there's what my surroundings have.
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000 I don't know if there's weapons available to me. So I'm going to get my hands up. But I am going to broaden my perspective.
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:52.000 And this is something that we talked about when Andrew Cuban was on here.
00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:08.000 It really calms you. It calms you down. So that's one of the steps of the attachment. So take a step back, lift your chin, look around, and then take a breath. A nice slow breath.
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000 Because this is nothing that's going to calm you down. It's another thing that's going to let you get control over your emotions.
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000 And this is something that people intuitively remember when you were a little kid and you'd be having a temper tantrum.
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000 I've seen it done. Okay. When your kids are having a temper tantrum, have you ever said like, hey, just take a breath.
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000 And this is something even. Okay. Let me give you a better example. You get hurt. Oh, your kid gets hurt.
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:39.000 And they're right. What do you tell them? Hey, take a breath calm down. Like take a breath. That's what we tell people to do.
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000 That's crazy. You said that example because it was watching old videos of my son like did some thing.
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000 It was a funny video. But you know, at the end of the video he trips over something falls down.
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000 He's like, what kind of he does near whatever and same deal and literally played out on the video.
00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000 But I was just watching that video. So like, I said, yeah, on the video. I was like, why is it breathe?
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000 Breathe. Breathe.
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000 It's true.
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000 Yeah.
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000 Very appropriate.
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.000 When Hickson was on here, Hickson wrote a book called Breathe. Right. So there's a reason for this.
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:20.000 And it's it's proven by experience of people that have been in pressure situations. And it's proven through
00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:28.000 Doctors who can tell you about the physiological impact of taking a nice slow breath.
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000 So that's what we're doing. This is going to help you detach in these pressure situations.
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000 Now listen, there's another little like a note.
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000 Let's say you're, let's say you and I work together and you're pissed off.
00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000 This is a lot different than you and I don't know each other and you're confronting me. Right.
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000 That's a self defense situation. Hands are coming up. I'm still going to de-escalate.
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000 I'm going to step back. I'm going to create space all those things. I'm trying to de-escalate.
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000 And by the way, I'm trying to get detached as well.
00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000 Because let's say, you know, you bumped into or I bumped into your girlfriend and spilled drinks on you and now you're all mad.
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000 Yeah.
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000 I don't know you, but now you're all mad. You're coming at me.
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000 Should I escalate my anger? Because you're coming at me?
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000 Or because you yell, swear at me and you push me?
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000 Should I let my anger get me?
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000 No, I should not. Because then bad things are going to happen.
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000 Instead, I should be stepping back creating distance looking around, getting my hands into a,
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000 into a defensive, yet non-threatening, open aspect towards you.
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000 That's what I need to do. Now, if you're not, but that's in a life threat or a self-defense situation.
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000 But in just a normal UNI are talking and you start getting pissed.
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000 But UNI worked together when I'm probably going to do as I step back as I take a breath.
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000 As I, as I brought my field, I'm, I'm probably going to just nod my head and let you know that I'm listening to what you're saying.
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000 And we're going to talk more about listening.
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000 But that's what I'm going to do.
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000 That's what I'm going to do.
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000 And as I wrote about in extreme ownership, I'm going to relax, look around, make a call.
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:08.000 That's it. That was the earliest way of me trying to teach Seth how to detach.
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000 Was me saying me writing on his home view window, hey, things are going wild.
00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000 Step one, relax, step two, look around, step three, make a call.
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000 That's the earliest sort of verse I'm trying to convey this message to someone.
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000 I didn't know how to say detach yet. Didn't, it didn't compute.
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000 I was just trying to tell them the physical act of what to do.
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000 Freaking relax, bro. Look around, see what else is going on.
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000 Okay, now make a call.
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000 Now, here's the deal on this stuff.
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000 You can't see anything when you're in the thing.
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000 You can't see anything when you're in the thing.
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000 And the solution to the problem isn't in the problem.
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000 And look, there's a mass shooting that just happened in a school horrible.
00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000 People keep saying, oh, when are you going to say about it?
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000 I need to see some after actions reports.
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000 I need to find out what happened. I don't know what happened.
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000 There's one of the things that I could tell you as you train people to handle horrible situations like that.
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000 You need to teach people to detach.
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000 Because if they're not detached, they can't see the solution to the problem.
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000 All they see is what's right in front of them.
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:30.000 So if you've got a shooter, an active shooter in a building,
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000 and you go into that building and you haven't been trained properly, you're going to get focused on that active shooter.
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000 Then if you think, oh, the active shooter isn't an active shooter anymore.
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000 It's a barricade shooter.
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000 You're going to, oh, that's a barricade shooter.
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000 Now I'm going to follow this other tactic technique or procedure.
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000 Because you're focused on what's right in front of your focused on that piece of information that you have.
00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000 And you're not going to take a step back and go, hey, what's really happening right now?
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000 Who can give me a report?
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000 Who has accountability for the students?
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000 How many students are there?
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000 How many are missing?
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000 Where are they located?
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000 Who's assembling that big picture?
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000 You know who's assembling that big picture?
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000 Someone that's detached from the situation.
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000 Hmm.
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000 And it is not easy to train people to do that.
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000 It used to take me a while to get a seal.
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000 Sometimes a seal that'd been in for five years, seven years, ten years,
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000 to get them to be able to, oh, there's mayhem going on in this building.
00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000 I need to be the one that takes a step back, looks at the big picture.
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000 And figures out what's actually happening.
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:45.000 The putting people through that advanced seal tackle training, the primary purpose
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000 was to get them to learn how to detach.
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000 And again, at the time, I didn't say it with these exact words.
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000 You know, I'd say you knew you set back, look at the big picture.
00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000 You know, like I was trying to convey it the best I could at the time,
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000 I might have used the word detach.
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000 But I know I would say things like, hey, take a step back, look around.
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000 You need to see this stuff.
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000 You need to look at the big picture.
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000 That was me trying to get these young seal leaders like Seth Stone.
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000 Hey, dude, relax and look around.
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000 That's what you need to do.
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.000 Because once we could get those young seal leaders to actually do that,
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000 all of a sudden they could solve these complex problems that we would throw out.
00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000 If they couldn't detach, no, no, if no one in a platoon detached, no one would solve the problem,
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000 and they would get slaughtered.
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000 If one person could take a step back and say, oh, wait,
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000 we shouldn't keep going down this hallway, or we shouldn't keep moving up this street.
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000 Or we shouldn't keep going up this ravine.
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000 Or we should go backwards right now.
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000 Or we should find that.
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000 If one person can see that, they win.
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000 If nobody sees it, they get slaughtered.
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000 So my primary goal with the leaders teaching them how to lead,
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000 the first thing they had to do is be able to detach.
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000 Now, once you detach, then you can see.
00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000 Then you teach them, okay, here's how you want to use the terrain.
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000 Here's the effective way to maneuver.
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000 Here's where you want to concentrate your forces.
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000 Like, all those things are great.
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000 If you can't detach, you can't do any of those things.
00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000 It's a lot harder than it looks.
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000 It's a lot harder than it seems,
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000 and the hype and the emotion and the energy,
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000 it tends to make us not want to detach.
00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000 And the natural tendency that we have as human beings
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000 is to focus on what's right in front of us.
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000 This is the natural tendency.
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000 That's how we survived as hunter-gatherers.
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000 As a hunter-gatherer, you either, okay, if you're a hunter,
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000 guess what, you gotta be focused on.
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000 You see movement, and it's a freaking pig that you're going to slaughter,
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000 kill with a bone arrow or a spear or whatever.
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000 You need to hype or focus on that thing.
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000 As an individual human, you need to hype or focus on that thing.
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000 If you're walking around and you see movement,
00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000 and it's a tiger, you need to focus on that thing.
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000 It needs to become your number one priority.
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000 And in order to survive, you need to focus.
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000 You need to get high-profocused, and that's what we're programmed for.
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000 And there's sometimes as an individual, you gotta do that sometimes.
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000 It's actually a great thing to have.
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000 You know, you're walking down the street,
00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000 and all of a sudden the cars coming up on the sidewalk,
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000 you focus on that thing, so you can avoid it.
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000 You've ever seen that like when they're trying to get a robot
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000 to catch a ball.
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000 It has to do eight billion calculations in point two seconds
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.000 to catch a ball.
00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000 I don't even know if there's a robot that can catch a fast ball
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000 from a pitcher.
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000 Yeah, like a humanoid robot, even with the size,
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000 with a glove, the size of a catcher's mitt.
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000 Or like a eye-gain almost guaranteed to you
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000 that they can't make one that could hit a baseball bat.
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000 I don't know.
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000 I've never seen one.
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000 If that's, there's a billion little calculations
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000 that have to get made.
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000 And I've also heard like baseball players win that,
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000 win the ball leaves, the pitchers hand.
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000 Like they're already predicting where it's going to be.
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000 I mean, obviously they are because they can hit it
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000 with a freaking skinny little bat.
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000 You know what I'm saying?
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000 Yeah.
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000 So there's times where this is fully beneficial.
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000 And that's what our, that's our natural tendency is
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000 is to get focused on this thing.
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000 That's right in front of us.
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000 But as leaders,
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000 and honestly in some situations as individuals,
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000 you're going to have a problem if you do that.
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000 And I think I was thinking about this on from 100% right.
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000 But it mostly has to do when you're dealing with humans.
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000 When you're dealing with a human threat.
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000 Because humans do coordinated attacks.
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000 Yeah.
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000 Right?
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:52.000 Sure.
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000 Like, oh, wolf, you might get attacked by a pack of wolves.
00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000 You'll lose just because they all attack you at the same time.
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000 And you might get eaten by a pack of sharks.
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000 But it's not because one distracted you and the other one snuck up.
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000 And you know what I'm saying?
00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000 There's a difference between mob attacks,
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000 which I think is what most animals do.
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000 And what humans do,
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000 which is humans are setting you up like a sucker and flanking you.
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000 Right?
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000 That's what humans do.
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000 That's what a, that's what like a sucker punches.
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000 Right?
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000 Oh, a sucker punches like, oh, you're there talking to me.
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000 I'm like, I'll beat you and boom, my buddy punches you inside of the head.
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000 Or hit you with a bottle from behind.
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000 That's what humans do.
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000 Humans are savages.
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000 And so even as individuals, sometimes if you get target fixation,
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000 you're going to have a problem.
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000 So when we're in complex situations,
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000 there could be an emergency, right?
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000 Emergency, a fire of a vehicle accident.
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000 There's a lot of stuff going on.
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000 Combat situations, obviously.
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000 And you know what else?
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000 This is where you make that mental transition.
00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000 An argument with someone.
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000 Maybe not even argument, but in the bait with someone.
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000 You've ever seen someone get lured in an argument and just flanked.
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000 Yeah.
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000 And it's because they didn't detach.
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000 Uh, a few good men.
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000 Yes.
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000 Right?
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.000 That's what it is, it's just a big flank, right?
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000 I'm going to get this guy so mad and so emotional.
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000 Yeah.
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000 That when I ask him this question, he's going to expose himself.
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000 Yep.
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000 And that's what Tom Cruise does, right?
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000 You're got down right.
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000 I already, the code read.
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000 That's exactly what he does.
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000 The kernel in that movie.
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000 Jack Nick, Jack Nicholson.
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000 Nicholson, yes sir.
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000 Jack Nicholson, he didn't detach.
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000 No.
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000 He could have seen through that so easily.
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000 Yep.
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000 He could have been like, no, I absolutely would not order that.
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000 You can, if you had a few videos calm.
00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000 Yeah.
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000 He didn't, that's a perfect example of how we can let this idea
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000 bite us.
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000 Yeah.
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000 So if perhaps, what's the kernel's name in that movie?
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000 Jessup.
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000 Cruf, if kernel Jessup, maybe if he would have gone through my landlord for a train
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000 back in the day.
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000 You know, like, oh, I'm about to get flanked by homeboy.
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000 If I'm young Tom Cruise, you know, kernel Jessup would have said,
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000 actually, no, negative.
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000 There's no way I'd give that order, but then said he got emotionally.
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000 F flanked like a little punk.
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000 So imagine how much that happens to us or can't happen to us.
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000 So that's what we have to learn how to do in everything.
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000 And here's a little connection I'm going to make for you.
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:45.000 There's a connection between being humble and being able to detach.
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000 And the connection is, if you're not humble, if you got a big ego, you think you're the
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000 center of the world.
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000 Right?
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000 You think you're, you think you are the center of the world.
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000 And when you think you're the center of the world, you can't see anyone else's emotions.
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000 You can't see anyone else's moves.
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000 There moves don't even mean anything to you because you're just looking at everything
00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000 as Jaco Centric, echo centric.
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000 It's all about me.
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000 So I don't see that you're getting mad.
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000 I don't see that you're getting frustrated.
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000 And that's what we have to be careful about.
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000 Because if you think you're the most important thing and you've got that gravity,
00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:34.000 it's pulling everything in and all of other ideas,
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000 then they don't make it.
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000 Other, they nothing else can survive this strong gravity that you got.
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000 You don't see anything else.
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000 What's the difference between detaching and situational awareness?
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000 Right?
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000 What's, I mean, is there a difference?
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000 If they're not the same thing, then they're damn close.
00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000 I would say I would say this.
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000 Detachment is senior to situational awareness.
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000 If you're not detached, you're not going to have any situational awareness.
00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000 If you are detached, you will have much more situational awareness.
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000 Detachment is senior because not only am I detached, so I can see what's happening in the situation.
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000 I'm also aware of my emotions.
00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000 I'm aware of your emotions.
00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000 Does the situation include everything?
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000 Okay, then they're probably the same thing.
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000 If we're saying that situation overall includes your emotions, my emotions are physical space that we're in.
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000 Everything that's occurring.
00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000 If that's the situation, okay, then they're probably pretty close to the same thing.
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:43.000 I generally think of situational awareness as to being what's our physical thing that's happening.
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000 But it's not too much to different to say, oh, echo is a possible attacker?
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000 Yeah, yeah.
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000 Is he agitated?
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000 Yeah, exactly.
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000 That would be situational awareness.
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000 Oh, I can see he's frustrated.
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000 I can see he's his fist or clenched.
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000 Okay, that's all situational awareness.
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000 So there are really similar things.
00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:11.000 But I think I still think detachment is a senior element because if you don't have detachment, it ain't happening.
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000 You're not going to have situational awareness at all.
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:22.000 Yeah, it feels like most of the time, see, they bring up detaching is when you're kind of in the one that chaotic situation kind of already started.
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000 Or it's almost like, I guess you can constantly be detached though, right?
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000 I mean, not completely.
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000 I mean, you know, I have time to hurt you explain. You're like, don't go too far with this thing.
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:44.000 Right? You don't care about nothing or whatever, but, uh, seems like detaching when I imagine it, I guess, is, yeah, when something like happens to kind of escalator whatever.
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000 And then it's like, okay, then you should kind of detach or whatever.
00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000 And you know what? Good point. Check this out.
00:31:52.000 --> 00:32:01.000 The, the black belt. He's likely not even going to get the situation to a point where he has detach because he's already attached to any sees it.
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000 Come on, he doesn't have to worry about it because he already outfanked it. That's the game.
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000 That's the game. That's what we're trying to do.
00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000 Unless he's going to up against another black belt unless he's going up on this.
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000 Then, thus begins the psychological game within the game.
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000 Yeah. And then you are end up in straight, due to where how many moves ahead, you know, M.I.
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000 To you. And my five moves ahead and you're only four. I'm going to win.
00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000 If I'm five moves ahead, but you're seven, you're going to win. That's what's happening.
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:39.000 So, there is a connection between the more self-centered we are, the less the rest of the world matters.
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000 And therefore, it's hard to step outside of your own world.
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000 Yeah. Maybe that's a better way of putting it.
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000 Yeah, that seems accurate.
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000 You know, for instance, a little kid that loses their temper. Why is that?
00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000 Because they're the whole world in the store. In the store.
00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000 They don't care about anything else. They want that freaking ice cream cone.
00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000 That's what's up. So they don't care about anything else.
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000 Yeah. And they're not going to be able to attach at all.
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000 Yeah. And they don't care about anything else.
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000 So the younger you are, you're really important.
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000 Yeah. So we have to be careful with that.
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:22.000 Here's another little element. Detachment is what actually allows you to think strategic.
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000 It's what actually allows you to think strategic.
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000 Because the definition of what I started with of saying,
00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000 Hey, I'm worried about the person that's shooting me right now.
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000 That's a short term thinking.
00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000 Now, do I have to focus on that right now? Because I'm getting shot at, yes, I do.
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000 The minute I eliminate that threat, I better take a step back and look around and get my platoon into position,
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000 where I don't have to worry about threats.
00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000 So I can see where we need to go next.
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.000 So unless we are detached unless you take a minute, you know, if you're in business and every day,
00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000 you show up to work the phones, ring in the emails or comment in your solving this problem for a client or dealing with operations,
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000 your deal with sales. You got all these problems. You're just that's what you're doing all day.
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000 Cool.
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000 But you're not detached. And therefore you're thinking about tactical things that are right in front of you.
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:16.000 And you might win the day tactically, but you look up in six months and you've, you've got some issues,
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000 because you didn't order enough material for the next project and you didn't hire enough,
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000 like all these problems are happening. Strategic problems are happening.
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000 So unless you're able to detach, you're not able to think strategic.
00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000 So think about how this impact your life.
00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:42.000 And this is, you know, from you echo Charles, you've said before to me that the most important thing that you've taken away from hanging out with me for the last however many years
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000 is thinking strategic instead of tactical.
00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000 And the way that translates to this civilian world is you think long term instead of short term.
00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000 And that I agree with you.
00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:01.000 And we have a, you've heard me say before and you pulled a clip from one of the, uh, musters where a guy asked me, you know,
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000 how often should I think strategic and I said you should think strategic all the time.
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000 You said it differently.
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000 Yeah, I was a little, little more amped at the time.
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000 But if you can't detach, if you don't take a step back, you will or not thinking strategic.
00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000 Yeah.
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000 That's why this is like a superpower.
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000 Detachment allows you to not focus on the short term.
00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000 It avoids tactical thinking.
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000 Now, it also avoids you getting emotional and making bad decisions because that's when you make bad decisions.
00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000 Are you guaranteed to make a bad decision where you're emotional?
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000 No.
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.000 But I mean, there's a real good chance.
00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000 Pretty reliable.
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000 Yeah, it's pretty reliable that an emotional decision is not the best decision.
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000 It's pretty reliable.
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000 Now, does this mean I'm sitting there saying it for everyone that's, you know, out there.
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000 Oh, you know, you say and you shouldn't have any emotions.
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000 That's actually not what I'm saying.
00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:00.000 And all what I'm saying is you shouldn't let your emotions run your decisions.
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000 Yeah.
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000 They do right.
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000 Control over your emotions does not mean not having emotions.
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:11.000 Because emotions are important.
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000 We like to say.
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:13.000 Yes.
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000 Emotions are important.
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000 My emotions are important.
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000 My teams emotions are important.
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000 My boss's emotions are important.
00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000 The competitor or the enemy emotions are important.
00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000 And I, okay, how can they be important?
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000 Well, if I, if you're mad about something that you need to do,
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000 Are you going to do a good job?
00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000 And you do, if you work for me, are you going to do your best job?
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000 If, on the contrary, if you're super excited about something,
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000 Are you going to do a good job?
00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000 Yeah.
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000 What if you're my enemy?
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000 And your morale is low and you're emotionally drained?
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000 Is it going to be an opportune time to fight you?
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000 Yes, it is.
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000 What if you're, what if I've done something to your people?
00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000 And now you're mad and you're going to fight with vengeance.
00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000 You're angry.
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000 Is, is that a good time for me to attack you from what your my enemy?
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000 No.
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000 What about my boss?
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000 My boss is super angry about something.
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000 How will good time to present a new solution to it? No.
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000 Is that like the old classic, don't tell your wife to calm down?
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000 That is part of the classic. Don't tell your wife to calm down.
00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000 Because like, yes, she's not, she's emotional.
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000 Whatever, we're in vice versa.
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000 But, you know, but the, yeah, when you say, hey, calm down.
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000 That's not a good move.
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000 Does that a strategic?
00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000 So you can see how emotions play into each one of those elements that I just talked about.
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000 Yeah. So I have, oh, and by the way, I have to know my emotions too, right?
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:48.000 If I've got some massive task and I know I'm already drained or angry about it.
00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000 If I've got some delicate, if I'm mad at you, I know, yeah, I've got to go and discuss a project with you.
00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000 And I'm already mad that you didn't do something.
00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.000 Is that a good time for me to go in? They're not talking to you. No, it's not.
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:04.000 So what I need to do and a way to think the emotions are own emotions
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:13.000 and other people's emotions up down across the chain of command need to be in the calculus of our decision making.
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000 That's what I need to do.
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:28.000 And a lot of times, in current times, this is 2022, we don't take other people's emotions into our calculus.
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000 So you have to measure.
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:43.000 You have to measure if and how what you are going to say, how it's going to impact your family.
00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000 If it's going to impact your family, your team, yourself. You have to measure that.
00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000 Is it going to make them angry? Is it going to make them upset? Is it going to make them lose motivation?
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000 Is it going to cross their morale?
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000 And if you don't put that, but if you don't put all the emotional element into the calculus,
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000 you're going to get the wrong answer.
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:11.000 And by the way, you won't be able to assess any of these emotions if you're not detached.
00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000 You won't see your own emotions. You won't see other people's emotions.
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000 You won't be like, oh, my wife is mad right now because you're mad.
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000 So you don't see them as being mad. And even if you do see them as being mad, you're mad.
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000 So you just get mad at them for being mad.
00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000 What you have to do is be able to detach and get some level of control over your emotions.
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.000 So when I talk about detaching from your emotions, I'm not talking about having no emotions.
00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.000 And by the way, if you detach from your emotions too much and now you're interacting with your team,
00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000 your team just thinks you're a jerk. That's what's happening.
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000 So yeah, like you don't care. Oh yeah, like you don't care.
00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000 Oh, that's a huge deal. Like when your boss doesn't care, is it distracted or just when you have that feeling is what I'm saying.
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:07.000 Or if you give that feeling to your wife, you know, something that you're talking about to me,
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000 who's all your time.
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000 Because that kind of is the deal, right?
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000 Where you like, you lit every single list item or everything,
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000 every topic you talked about literally has directly to do.
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000 I mean, look, some people not married, I get it.
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000 But if you are even girlfriend boyfriend scenario, whatever.
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000 That applies to you in your life.
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000 100%.
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000 Oh yeah, it's like the end of your kids.
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:34.000 So the kids, there is a you, it's playing, yeah, it's more like,
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000 I don't know, it's like, it is the same thing. It's the same format for sure.
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000 But you explain this too, where it's like your kids are going to be different than like other people because
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000 when you have kids, that's a very unique relationship.
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.000 It's very unique.
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000 Like you can't, you can't just switch out one kid for another kid and make the connection.
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000 So it's supposed to make what's the connection?
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000 The emotions.
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000 The emotions.
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000 Yeah, the connection.
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:04.000 That's what makes it, you know, your emotional attachment to your kids is so strong.
00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:16.000 It's so strong that you have to be even more cautious in how you and how you calculate the emotions up and down the chain.
00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000 So it's kind of like the difference between a muffin and a cupcake.
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000 But I don't know the difference between those two.
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000 I think one just has more sugar in it.
00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000 Is that the truth?
00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000 I don't know.
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000 Which one has more sugar?
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000 Cupcake.
00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000 Okay.
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000 Seems same?
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000 Yeah, I guess.
00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000 The kids have more sugar.
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.000 They have more emotion.
00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000 More emotions.
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000 A type of, or involved in the equation.
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.000 But you handle them the same way.
00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000 We're trying not to eat them.
00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000 Yeah.
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000 80 to 90% of the time.
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000 Seems same.
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000 Yep.
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000 So you can't see any of these emotions if you're not detached.
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000 So go back to first topic of the day, take a step back, relax, look around, take a breath,
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000 get detached, and then put the emotions, comprehend the emotions, put them into your
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000 calculus as you're making decisions, as you're communicating with people.
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000 And that's going to put you in a different, put you in a better scenario.
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:16.000 Now, here's another thing that you can utilize for detachment, which is very powerful,
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000 not just for detachment, but for life and definitely for leadership.
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000 And that is actually listening to what other people are saying.
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000 And I've been saying for a couple of years now, listening is the most unarrated skill in leadership.
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:40.000 And I think I have to take it a little bit further and I'll think it about a good way to explain listening.
00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000 Because listening doesn't just mean be quiet.
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000 Okay, echo is talking now as soon as you're done.
00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000 I'm ready to present my ideas back at you.
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000 I don't know where we did this.
00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000 I think we probably just did this on a Q&A while ago, but people will have often asked me,
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000 what is my process for reading a book?
00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:05.000 And I've talked through my process for reading a book and reading a book for the podcast, really.
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:12.000 So if I'm reading a book for the podcast, I'm going to read it actively.
00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000 It's an active reading.
00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000 I'm not passively.
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000 The words aren't just coming into my head and there they are.
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000 And no, I'm actively reading the words.
00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000 That means I am putting the words into context in my own head.
00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000 In the story that it is.
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.000 And then how my mind understands that story and what the context in the story is.
00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000 And then how that context fits in my head.
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000 Because that's face it.
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000 I found reading with the old breed.
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000 There's context to that story.
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000 To that particular sentence, that particular paragraph, that particular word, this context around it.
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000 And it's not just the word.
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000 It's not just a paragraph.
00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000 There's a whole world there that you have to try and understand.
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000 This context that you have to have.
00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000 And then you have to put it into your own context.
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:13.000 And look, you don't have to have been in combat to understand or to put your own context around it.
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000 You go, oh, these guys haven't eaten for six days.
00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000 Hey, I remember yesterday.
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000 I didn't have any lunch.
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000 By the end of the day, I was starving.
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000 God, now these guys are six years.
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:34.000 You have to really try and engage your own brain and overlay your own experiences on it.
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000 And try and understand and truly put yourself into other people's perspective.
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000 What do they know that I can try and understand?
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000 So to me, that's active reading.
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000 Really active reading.
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000 And that's what we need to do with listening.
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000 Actively listen.
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000 Actively try and understand what you're trying to say.
00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000 Actively try and understand your perspective.
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000 What does echo know that I don't know right now?
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:14.000 How can I actively try and understand what he's saying?
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:21.000 And of course, one of the biggest obstacles to truly listening is having a big giant ego.
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000 And I think echo alone, no, he's not going to mind.
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000 You know what I mean?
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000 Like, oh, hey, John, you always put my arm.
00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000 Oh, my hips over here on my arm. Oh, echo's trying to get me instructions on your jits.
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000 Oh, yeah.
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000 You know what I'm saying?
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:40.000 That's what our ego gets in the way because how could anybody possibly know anything more than me?
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000 So we don't really listen.
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:50.000 And I think I think that as we look at society today,
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:57.000 there is a lot of talking and not a lot of listening.
00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000 And it turns into me and here's the thing.
00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:09.000 Talking, no listening, and therefore no, no bridges, no common ground found.
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000 No changes of opinion. People don't change opinion.
00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000 Right? I got my opinion. I'm right.
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000 I'm not going to change my opinion. That's where people are at.
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000 That's where the vast majority of people are at.
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000 Seems like you.
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000 Oh, I shouldn't see you say the vast.
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000 That's where the loudest people are at.
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000 I guess it's worth saying.
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000 Yeah.
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000 Yeah.
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000 I think it's an issue.
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.000 I think it's a huge issue.
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000 I think it's a issue for myself, even.
00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000 A lot of it's an issue for everybody.
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000 Myself, for yourself, everybody that's in the world.
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000 Is hey, I kind of know the deal here.
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000 Yeah, I know this.
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000 You're not going to tell me anything.
00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000 Yeah.
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.000 And what's horrible about that is,
00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000 you know, if you were presenting a plan to me for an operation,
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000 you're not going to be able to do that.
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000 And I have a difference of opinion in the new.
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000 And so I, and but I don't listen to what you're saying.
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000 Are we going to come up with a better plan or a worse plan?
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000 Plymercy.
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000 It's going to be a worse plan.
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000 Where is the faculty? Oh, echoes presenting a plan to me.
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000 Let me truly actively listen to what he's saying.
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000 Let me see how that fits into the idea that I have.
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000 And where's the common ground?
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000 What? Oh, and we got some, we got some,
00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000 and we got some.
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000 Who's right? And you know what I actually say?
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000 How is echo right?
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:29.000 That's the biggest trick right there.
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000 When it comes to leadership, one of the biggest tricks in leadership is
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000 how is echo right? I'm the leader, but how is echo right?
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000 How can I make echo right? How can I listen to him?
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000 How can I make him, how can I give him the, the, the,
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000 the advantage here?
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000 Not how can I prove him wrong?
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000 I don't want you to be wrong. I want you to be right.
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:47.000 Yeah.
00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000 So that's what we have to do. Now when we listen, just like reading,
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000 when we actively listen, we actively read,
00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:01.000 ask yourself or ask them and yourself earnest questions.
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000 Put yourself in their shoes, in real life, and this is hard to do.
00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000 In real life, in real life, truly,
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000 how would I feel if I were that person?
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.000 And you know sometimes like, you know, echo, let's see.
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000 Echo didn't pay for his phone.
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000 He got his phone cut off, right?
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000 So I go, what a loser.
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000 Like he, he's an idiot. He deserves it.
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000 Yeah.
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000 That's as far, like, oh, well, okay.
00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000 If I was an echo, she was an onion,
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000 I didn't pay my phone bill and it got cut off.
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000 I would think I was a loser.
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000 That's like my perspective.
00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000 And set us in, all right, what's the situation he's in?
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000 How did he end up here?
00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000 What doesn't he understand about the world that I understand?
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000 How come he doesn't understand those things?
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000 That's what, that's what it is.
00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000 It's like, it takes effort.
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000 Yeah.
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000 It takes effort to get there.
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000 And set it just right and it off.
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000 And I put, I take my entire world view.
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000 And I take your little chunk of experience that you had by not paying your phone bill.
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000 Like, oh, in my world view, you're a loser.
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000 Yeah.
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000 That's true.
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000 That's true.
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000 And so then what, how can I help you?
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000 I can't, I can't help you.
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.000 I can't help myself.
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000 I can't help anybody else.
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000 All I say is, oh, anyone that does that's a loser?
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000 I'm not, that doesn't solve anything.
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000 So that's what I think is a, is a huge,
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:35.000 a huge piece for us is as a leader and as a person.
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000 And look, those two terms for me are kind of interchangeable.
00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000 I don't know, that sounds crazy.
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000 But as, this is something that I started saying,
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000 I think when leadership strategy and tactics came out,
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000 which is, if you interact with other human beings,
00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000 you're in a leadership position.
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000 It doesn't matter if, it doesn't matter if you're,
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000 it doesn't matter if you're the boss.
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000 Yeah.
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000 And I'm the subordinate.
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.000 And I'm the only subordinate you have.
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000 I'm a son of a leadership position.
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000 Yeah.
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000 It doesn't matter if I have one peer.
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000 And we, and I don't see you even though you're the boss.
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000 I have one peer.
00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000 I'm still in a leadership position.
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000 If you interact with other people, you're in a leadership position.
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000 Because you're trying to lead them to do the right thing,
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000 to moving the right direction.
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000 And does this mean you're always trying to influence?
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000 No, because I might be like, oh, Echo's giving me some direction.
00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000 It seems like good call.
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.000 Cool.
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000 I'm going to go execute.
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000 I don't need to like, well, hold on.
00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.000 Let me give you more perspective.
00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000 No, no, I'm not talking about that at all.
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000 Am I trying to build a relationship with you?
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000 Yes, I am.
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000 And I try to build a relationship so that I can better support you in the future.
00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000 If you happen to tell me something to do, that doesn't make sense?
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000 Sure.
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:48.000 Yeah, it's good that you differentiate pretty often to the difference between what you call the traditional leader.
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000 And you know, what?
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000 And what?
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000 But what's the other way?
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000 You don't have a term for the other one?
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000 No, I certainly do.
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000 The sign-let leader.
00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000 Sign-let leader.
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000 Yeah, you're right.
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000 So, okay.
00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000 So, and even though you don't talk about that part,
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000 we just, we just mentioned like,
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000 usually it's kind of like, the silent leader is more of like, sort of,
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000 of maybe influencer type, not influencer like, I don't know.
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000 But like, you know, someone who just wants to influence people to do the right thing for everybody,
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000 essentially, right?
00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000 And then the traditional leader is the guy who wants to be the boss and wants everyone to listen to what they said.
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000 Yep.
00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000 Everyone listen to me.
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000 Yeah.
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000 Which is the opposite of everything I just talked about, which is saying, if you're a leader, you'd be listening.
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000 Yeah, it's exactly right.
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:34.000 But I think that even the word leader, and I said this for where the word leader feels like it,
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000 the, like, the boss that, because there are people like that.
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000 They tell each other, yeah, they tell each other, yeah.
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000 And because there's people like that.
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000 Like, we all know somebody at least one person, probably, you know,
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:49.000 20 people who are like that, where it's like, yeah, you could tell they want to always take charge.
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000 They want, they always want people to listen to them.
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000 They always want to do it their way, you know, kind of thing, and, you know, for better words or whatever,
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000 it's, I'm just saying that that's when you think of the word leader.
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000 That's kind of what you think of automatically and when we're in the other.
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.000 Yeah.
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000 Absolutely.
00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:17.000 That's one of the, one of the, I guess, long term campaigns for me as a human being on earth is to convince people and let them know that even if you're a brand new guy in a seal-patoon, you're in a leadership position.
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000 A brand new guy with no experience, you're in a leadership position.
00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000 Even if you're a brand new construction worker with no experience,
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000 you're in a leadership position.
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000 Even if you're a lineman out there, you're at a apprentice lineman.
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000 You have no skills, you're in a leadership position.
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:39.000 So, of the four laws of, here's the thing, there's no escaping unless you're a hermit, you're a leader, right?
00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000 So there's no escaping unless you're maybe a newborn baby, I don't know.
00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:48.000 But, and this is, this is what I gathered, you know, on the listening to you guys.
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000 So, you know, the fourth law of combat, decentralized, come at.
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000 As we know as a decentralized.
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.000 And the, what is that, the tagline or whatever everybody leads, right?
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000 So, even if you are a the leader, designated, cross the, you're the boss, either.
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000 You're the buyer of a company, whatever, you're the dad of the family, whatever, whatever, whatever.
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000 You're the straight-up boss.
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:15.000 But, decentralized command, which is law of combat, says everybody leads.
00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.000 So, even the people who are subordinate to you, quote, I'm quote,
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000 they have to lead and whose job is it for them to know how to lead your job.
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000 So, everyone's a leader, no matter if you're the boss or not.
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.000 Like, you can be the new guy, whatever, and most of us are the new guy and it's seal platoon.
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000 I'll tell you that.
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000 You may or may not know that, but, some, most of us are not.
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.000 But, like, if you're just the new guy at work or you're the youngest brother or, you know, you're the, you know,
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000 I've heard that, and I have this scenario.
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000 I'm going to call it hypothetical, even though it might not be hypothetical.
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:56.000 It's not me, that's true, but someone has some people I know, where the husband feels a little bit, what he called,
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000 like, emasculated sometimes.
00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:04.000 And not by any abuser, anything like that, but it's just, I think it's like a classic case of, you know,
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000 what you hear like the husband's always trying to like, happy wife happy life, kind of a thing,
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:13.000 and maybe went too far with it, and maybe now he finds himself in a position where he's like,
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000 he's just responding and doing everything that the wife says,
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000 and the wife doesn't seem happy, kind of a scenario.
00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:27.000 I feel like, with this attitude that, like, if you understand, 100% 100% not just like,
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.000 hmm, my situation, sure, I guess I could kind of, if you understand 100% that you are,
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000 essentially, you have the responsibility to be the leader, and I'm not saying, be the boss.
00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:43.000 I'm not saying, it always feels like that ends up being absolutely correct,
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000 as far as solving any problems with any interpersonal relationship.
00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.000 So, let me just restate your, your comment there.
00:54:53.000 --> 00:55:01.000 What you're saying is no matter where I am in a relationship, in a platoon, in a business, in a marriage,
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:08.000 if my attitude is, I'm in a leadership position, I'm going to lead through this problem.
00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000 The sign that leader is going to be a positive thing.
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000 Yes, sir. Yeah, you are correct. Absolutely.
00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.000 That's why at Ashland Front, that's why we say leadership is the solution.
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000 And it doesn't matter what the problem is.
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000 Yeah.
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000 Wife's not happy, leadership problem. On me, by the way, on me.
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:35.000 Now, look, could can you occasionally get a miserable scenario where, oh, the wife is,
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:40.000 well, there's probably, and actually what you end up there is, if you break that down from a leadership perspective,
00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000 you're probably not aligned in your marriage.
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000 Because that's the one kind of killer.
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000 There's one, that's one killer.
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000 So, when I say leadership is a solution, leadership is a solution, all your problems.
00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:00.000 There's one problem that leadership is the solution for, but you're not going to solve the problem.
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000 That is alignment. That is, we are not going to the same place.
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:13.000 So, if your business partner is going in one direction, like two different place, and you're going in another direction,
00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:20.000 and it's a different place, you're going to have a really, you won't be able to make decisions that are unified.
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:32.000 If your wife, you know, if your wife wants to, you know, have 20 kids, and you don't want to have any,
00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.000 you're not going to be able to work it out.
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000 You're not working that out.
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000 You are heading to a different place. You're going to a different world.
00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000 You're going to two totally different places.
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:50.000 Vice versus true, too. You want to, wait, what do I say? Your wife wants to, when it gets, if it's the opposite, it's the same thing.
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:54.000 You want to have 20 kids, your wife doesn't have any. You're going to have a problem.
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000 It's going to be a difficult situation. You're probably, you're not aligned.
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:08.000 If one person wants to have a software company, and I want to, you know, you and I start designing a little computer game thing.
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:15.000 And then you say, hey, we should, we start building these in a factory after we make three of them by ourselves.
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:19.000 And I say, no, let's just contract somebody that we should just make the software.
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.000 And you, no, no, we should make the hardware. And I say, no, we should make the software.
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000 And if you and I can't agree, we're heading to two different places.
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000 We're going to have two different companies and you need to go do yours, 90 to go do mine.
00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:35.000 So where leadership plays, and that is, I need to be able to identify where are we actually going?
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:40.000 What is our goal? And here's the thing, in most companies, you can find the line.
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000 That's why people say, we're not aligned. I go, hold on a minute. Oh, you got a company.
00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000 You know, you got acme freaking mouse traps, right?
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000 Yeah, mouse traps.
00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000 Echo's got acme mouse traps. And he says, oh, people on my team aren't aligned.
00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000 Okay, what do they not want to be able to make money?
00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000 No, of course they want to make money. Do they do they, does everyone on the team want to make money?
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000 Yes, everyone on the team wants to make money. Does everybody on the team want to make a good mouse trap?
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000 Yes, everybody on the team wants to make a good mouse trap. Does everyone on the serve the client? Yes.
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000 Because if we serve the client, we'll sell them mouse traps.
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000 So you can usually, you take any company.
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.000 And most of the, the 90, this is a big percentage.
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:26.000 99% of the time, there's alignment. And in rare one percent, we're not aligned.
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000 And you actually don't want to make mouse traps.
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:35.000 Or you don't want to manufacture mouse traps. Let's say, I want to build a factory in manufactured mouse traps.
00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000 And all you want to do is market them.
00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000 And you don't want any of this factory stuff. You don't want to hire a bunch of people.
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.000 You just want to get them shipped from overseas. You're not going to have a problem.
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.000 We're not aligned.
00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000 I want to build a manufacturing company. You want to build a marketing company.
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:55.000 And we're adamant about it. Now look, we might be able to find the linemen and say, hey, you know what?
00:58:55.000 --> 00:59:00.000 If we build manufacture them and then you market them well, we kind of on the same page.
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000 Yeah.
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.000 But if your true goal is not to manufacture anything and my true goal is to, we're going to have a problem.
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.000 So alignment is.
00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:17.000 One of the most critical things there are in order to get there. Guess what? I got to listen what you have to say.
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000 Yep.
00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.000 And if we're not aligned, we're going to have a problem.
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000 So we got to pay attention to that.
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.000 And this brings me to the last thing I wanted to talk about today.
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.000 And this is something you know of.
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:37.000 I probably used it. I've probably focused on it a little bit more a few years ago.
00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.000 We're going to have a simple statement that you'll recognize when I say this, free your mind.
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000 Right. We had, we did all kinds of things.
00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:47.000 I said, free your mind. I'm decasing like post like free your mind.
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:47.000 Sure.
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:53.000 Because our mind or minds tend to have a tendency to be closed.
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.000 And not just to be closed, but to be closing.
00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000 So that's the way our human minds are in general.
01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000 They tend to be closed and closing.
01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000 So they're already closed up and they're trying to close even more.
01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000 Why is that? Well, it's safer.
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000 Yeah.
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000 It's easier.
01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000 I'm not learning anything.
01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000 There's no risk. There's nothing to misunderstand.
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000 It's just easier across the board if I just close up my mind.
01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.000 I don't have to accept anything, no.
01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000 I'm safe here.
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000 I'm used to it.
01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000 We also have our ego involved.
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000 And our ego is keeping that mind shut.
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000 Because I don't want to have to admit that I'm wrong.
01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000 I don't want to have to tell anybody else that they're right.
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000 I don't want to look like I don't know all the answers.
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000 So I stay in my own little world.
01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000 He looks like, oh, I'm a boxer.
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000 So I'm not going to do GJ2.
01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000 Remember those days?
01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000 Like, no, boxing or, oh, you trying to take me out.
01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.000 I'm just going to knock you out.
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.000 Remember those days?
01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000 Yeah.
01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000 That gets crazy.
01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000 Talk now.
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000 Well, I don't have to learn GJ2. I'll just knock you out.
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000 Okay. How'd that work out, bro?
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000 But that's a close mind.
01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000 And that's ego.
01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000 Thinking, oh, I don't need to learn anything new.
01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000 I have all the answers.
01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000 Oh, I got that uppercut.
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000 Son.
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000 And no, look, I love boxing.
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000 Boxing is an awesome form of self defense
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.000 that everybody should learn out of box.
01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000 You should absolutely learn out of box.
01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000 There's two, you know, your fists are great weapons.
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000 You should also learn more about it.
01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000 You should also learn wrestling.
01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000 Because you got to be able to.
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000 So you see where I'm going with this.
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000 But there was a time where
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000 strikers, boxers, kickboxers would say, oh, I don't need to learn GJ2.
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000 Because I'll just knock you out.
01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000 And that was just arrogance and ego.
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.000 And part of it is also might have been just ignorance.
01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000 Not just arrogance, but ignorance.
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000 Yeah.
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000 Because, because, because you think, oh, someone's going to charge it.
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000 Me, I'll just knock him out.
01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000 And I think that's what I think.
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000 And that's what I think.
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000 And that's what I think.
01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000 And that's what I think.
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.000 And that's what I think.
01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000 And that's what I think.
01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000 And you're going to charge it.
01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000 Me, I'll just knock him out.
01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000 Yeah, man, it's so much harder than you think.
01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000 Yeah, I'm sure there was a lot to that.
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000 There was, there's a thing called sunk cost, palace.
01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000 Oh, for sure.
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000 For sure.
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000 So yeah, and that's what Horyn Gracie, one of the good founders of GJ2.
01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000 That's what he would say.
01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000 Where it's like, it's a, it's a painful realization.
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000 When you realize that you spent 20, sometimes 30 years at this,
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000 an effortful, just hard work.
01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000 Yeah.
01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000 You know, it's hard.
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000 And then without it being proved to you, like, you're not going to admit that it was a mistake.
01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000 You just can't do it.
01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000 You have too much invested in it.
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:42.000 You know, yeah, that was, that was a very, you want to talk about a very hard thing to have happened to you.
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.000 Yeah.
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000 Is you've been training whatever martial art, whatever.
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.000 And they used this today to use the term traditional martial art.
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000 Yes.
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000 So you've been training a traditional martial art.
01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000 Take your pick for 24 years.
01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000 And like you said, hard training.
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000 You've memorized the cada.
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000 You've done the drills.
01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:05.000 You've done the, the sparring even.
01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000 Yeah.
01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000 And then, so you're, you're 20 years deep, 25 years deep.
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000 You've competed even.
01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000 You've competed.
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000 And you've, you've knocked people out.
01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000 And stuff.
01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000 And you've won.
01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000 You've been at champ and all these things.
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000 And then all of a sudden someone comes in and says,
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000 No, that's going to work.
01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000 Yeah.
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000 And by the way, it's, it's going to work.
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.000 What I do is going to work 10 times out of 10.
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000 But that's what, that's what my percentages are.
01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000 So you're a, you're a, you're a boxer.
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000 And how much is your just your guy?
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.000 I'm going to take you down and choke you 10 times in a row.
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000 It seems unbelievable.
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.000 Right.
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.000 They go a hundred times.
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000 Maybe someone gets a, gets a putters chance.
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000 Someone gets knocked out, right?
01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000 But I can, I can,
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000 Law of averages say you're a hundred percent boxer.
01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000 And I'm a jiu-jitsu guy.
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000 10 times out of 10.
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000 So if you, you and I got okay.
01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:58.000 Cool.
01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000 Let's go again.
01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000 You try and knock me out.
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000 You're getting taken down.
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:01.000 You're getting choked.
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000 Let's go again.
01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000 You're getting, you try and knock me out.
01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000 You're going to get take down.
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000 Choked out.
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000 That's what's happening.
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:13.000 So that was a really hard, hard fact to face.
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000 Yeah.
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000 And it happened to happen across the country as jiu-jitsu.
01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000 Belts.
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:17.000 Yeah.
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000 Blue belts were dough jostormy.
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000 Like walking into, walking into traditional martial arts studio.
01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000 I'll take anybody in here.
01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000 Yeah.
01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000 And then double leg, double leg, you know, cross side.
01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000 People even know what the guard was.
01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000 It wasn't like they were getting in the guard.
01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000 They were just mounting and choking.
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000 Yeah.
01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.000 Yeah.
01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000 And that was kind of the,
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000 Especially, I mean, now this is different.
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.000 Cause it totally different.
01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000 Yeah.
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000 You know, like, yeah.
01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000 And here's kind of, you know, it's kind of more the same.
01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000 No, right?
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000 We're, we're okay.
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000 So you look at the UFC, right?
01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000 The pinnacle of like now it is.
01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000 Like now it is.
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000 It's not UFC one is different than UFC now.
01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000 Oh.
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000 So UFC one was this art style versus style versus this style.
01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000 Actually, you know what, you're right.
01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000 It wasn't just style versus it was art versus art.
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:02.000 Yeah.
01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000 Because even in jiu-jitsu, we have different styles of jiu-jitsu.
01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000 Yeah.
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000 So it was literally a jiu-jitsu practitioner against the boxer.
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.000 Right.
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000 Or a wrestler against an Ikeedo guy.
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000 Yeah.
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000 Or whatever.
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000 You name it was art against art.
01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000 And they didn't even really calculate the fact that there's a huge difference between
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000 somebody that wrestled in high school, somebody that wrestled in college and somebody that
01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000 wrestled in Olympics.
01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.000 Or someone that did jiu-jitsu at the jiu-jitsu club, someone that did jiu-jitsu in college,
01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000 and someone that did jiu-jitsu on the Olympic stage.
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000 There's a huge difference between the two.
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.000 But they didn't really calculate that.
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.000 Yeah.
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000 Not really.
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000 And I guess I'm just maybe speaking on what actually played itself out.
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000 Right.
01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000 And for you, C1, there was Gracie in action.
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000 The Gracie in action tapes.
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.000 Right.
01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000 Which was essentially one and one challenge.
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.000 I have James's James, if you're out there listening right now, have your Gracie in action tapes.
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000 Sorry.
01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000 The James James.
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000 Where it's like, and if you don't know what that is, what it is essentially,
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000 guys would come in doubting this new jiu-jitsu thing.
01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000 They were like, oh, I would beat them.
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000 You know?
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000 And the Gracie's they would say, yeah, you can come in challenge anyone of our guys or whatever.
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000 And then after so many people responded to that challenge, they started taping it.
01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000 And they would just beat these guys up.
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000 Not bad.
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000 It wasn't a bully situation.
01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000 It was literally like to prove to them that, hey, this way is better at fighting.
01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000 That's it.
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000 It's not like, yeah, we're going to kill everyone or nothing like that.
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000 So just time after time or time.
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000 And then if you see it, you can see the guy.
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000 And this is on a bunch of them too, where the guy would be like, oh, like, almost like he's saying that didn't count.
01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000 Yeah, that's true.
01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000 But he didn't get it.
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:40.000 Yeah.
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000 I have personally experienced that.
01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000 Oh, yeah, that's the common thing.
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:51.000 Yeah, I was lucky because I was doing GJ2 kind of like legitimately doing GJ2 before it was popular at all.
01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000 Yeah.
01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.000 So I kind of had some of those Gracie and Action experiences where guys were just confused.
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:57.000 Yeah.
01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000 Like just legitimately.
01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:07.000 And I found that usually three or four submissions before they even start to comprehend what's happening.
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000 Like the first one they're just baffled.
01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000 You know, you're going against the rest or you're going against a boxer.
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000 Ressers would get especially confused because it just didn't make sense.
01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000 Or what just happened.
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000 Like a boxer, I guess a boxer would be so confused.
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000 They're like, wait, what are we doing on the ground?
01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000 What?
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000 Why am I down there?
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000 Is this fighting?
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000 This isn't fighting.
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000 How can you knock me out when we're, oh, they just, you just got your on bro.
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000 Or you just got tapped out.
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:38.000 Resslers would be, it would be confusing to them because they don't even understand how
01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000 these body positions that they've learned and that they've won.
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000 And that they seem to have so much control of us on.
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:47.000 They're not working and they're getting tapped out.
01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000 But yeah.
01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000 So like the first submission is total disbelief.
01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000 They're like, it's confusion and disbelief.
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000 And then okay, let's go again.
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000 Because they think, oh, I, I will keep my, I won't let them grab my own.
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000 Yeah.
01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000 Exactly.
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000 And they don't let you grab the arm and then you choke them.
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000 Yeah.
01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000 And that's how, how boring describes it.
01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000 And then, um, in those, a lot of those videos is, it's like you can't, they can accept it.
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000 Right.
01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000 So they're, so they'll be like, oh wait, I just need to go harder.
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000 Like I, maybe, it was taking me to easy on him.
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000 Maybe I have to focus a little bit more.
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000 Yeah.
01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000 Go faster.
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000 Go harder.
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:21.000 Yeah.
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000 Exactly.
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:22.000 Right.
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000 Um, but just like I said, if you don't know, you just, if you don't know,
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000 you don't know the positions, you just sort on the ground.
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000 Like you don't know.
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000 Like even, like the difference between garden and half garden.
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000 If you don't know what any of that even is, there's no difference.
01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000 No, there's no difference in garden mountain.
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000 Nothing. There's no difference.
01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000 You will not remember.
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000 You have no difference.
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000 If you're on the bottom of your remember versus if you're not on the bottom.
01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000 Okay. There is that.
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000 But in Gigi to that part doesn't matter as much.
01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000 It seems like so backwards almost if you know Gigi to versus if you, if you, if you don't.
01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000 So these guys would be just confused the whole time.
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.000 And then all of a sudden they're getting choked and then if you don't know how it happens,
01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000 you just like, oh, we just sort of wound up like that.
01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000 So it seems kind of like a lucky position.
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.000 You fell on the ground.
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000 It was a scrambled boy.
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000 And just like, you know, ended up that way.
01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.000 Meaning what meanwhile since they know they knew Gigi to their methodically, specifically placing these guys in this position,
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000 then this position, then this position, then they can choke.
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.000 And they do it every like one time after another after another.
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000 And then finally the guy accepts it.
01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000 No, and this is back in the Gracian actually this.
01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000 So you have to see one.
01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000 You don't have that luxury to be like, hey, let's do it again.
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:24.000 Yeah.
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000 But still nobody knew what was going on.
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000 What was happening.
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000 Now keep in mind the difference between back then and today is back then, no, no, Gigi to that all.
01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000 They only knew their karate.
01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000 They only knew their, you know, kickboxing.
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000 They only knew their art.
01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000 Now everyone knows everything.
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:39.000 Yeah.
01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000 It's totally.
01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000 In one way or another, like if you say, hey, show me mount.
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000 Probably because of course mount.
01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000 That's basic.
01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000 Everyone knows their mount.
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000 I don't think this can be literally a karate guy.
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:47.000 Yeah.
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000 Like remember Leo to Machita, right?
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:52.000 When I was like, oh, see, karate does work and all the karate guys were like,
01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000 yeah, for we were saying this for years, we always knew karate or
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000 the brother Leo to Machita's back.
01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000 Yeah.
01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000 And he's probably black, well, leveling up a bunch of other things.
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000 You know, so it's just a different landscape.
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000 That's not the proving ground from four art versus art anymore.
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:06.000 Yes.
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000 It's different.
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000 Well, even I just made people mad just now.
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:16.000 Three minutes ago when I said, well, a boxer against the G, there's still some people out there
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000 that are like, bro, just knock this dude out.
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000 He came in on me.
01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.000 There's still people like that right now, even having the, the incredible vast source of knowledge.
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000 And again, I love boxing.
01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000 Everyone should train boxing.
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000 100% boxing is a brutal martial art.
01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000 And it's an incredible martial art.
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000 But if you're a pure boxer and you're going up against the G,
01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000 you're going to get choked out.
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000 I regret to inform you.
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000 So here's the thing.
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000 This is why I talk about opening up your mind.
01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000 Because even when you choke someone, their mind doesn't want to open up.
01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000 Then you unlock them.
01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000 Their mind doesn't want to open up.
01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000 Then you foot lock them.
01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000 Their mind still, but they're still thinking like what you're saying.
01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000 They're still like, no.
01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000 They're mind.
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.000 This is such a good example of how people's minds,
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.000 how all of our minds wants to be closed.
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:15.000 Because our ego is keeping it shut.
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000 We want to be in that safe area.
01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000 We've got the sunk costs and what we've already done and what we already believe.
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000 And that is a problem.
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000 It's a problem for the world.
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000 So what we have to do and I've been explaining this to people,
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000 at S.L.M.Fron, I've been explaining this to people.
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000 We actually have to pry open our minds.
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000 We have to pry open our minds.
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000 You have to force yourself to listen.
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.000 You have to force yourself, not just to listen,
01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000 but to actually hear what other people are saying.
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000 You have to force yourself to consider other ideas.
01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:00.000 And honestly, the way that I force myself to consider other ideas is I want to use your idea.
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000 That's my goal.
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000 My goal is I want echo to be right.
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000 When echo says, hey, I've got a plan for how to do this,
01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000 my goal is to say, that sounds good.
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000 Let's use your plan.
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000 How can I help you make this work?
01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000 When my subordinate comes to me with a plan and says, hey,
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000 jockel, this is what I think we should do.
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000 My goal is to use it.
01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:28.000 When you present an idea to me about politics or music or a video,
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:34.000 my goal is to say, okay, how can I be on board with what you just said?
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000 How can I support you?
01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:42.000 And that's what I do to try and pry my brain open
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:48.000 because our minds are naturally closed and they are closing.
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000 So even when your mind gets open up a little bit,
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000 it's still trying to close back up.
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000 That's what it's trying to do.
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000 It's pride opening it closes back up.
01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000 That's what it's trying to do.
01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000 We have to work very hard to pride open and then keep it open to new ideas.
01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.000 You know, like we in regards to like,
01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000 we using the other person's plan or like pursuing that as a way.
01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:15.000 How does that, oh, should I say, how does that just a,
01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000 you know, because you know how sometimes it again,
01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000 I'm thinking about maybe with your friends when you're young or with your wife or something.
01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000 And so I say, hey, what are we doing for dinner or where are we going to go eat?
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000 And then I say, I don't know where do you want to go?
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.000 I don't know where you want to go.
01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000 You get that scenario to happen sometimes, right?
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.000 So how do you reconcile using the other person's plan in general versus
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000 making the decision yourself kind of a scenario?
01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000 You know, I mean, look, just like anything, there's a back caught of me.
01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000 And if I say to my wife, where do you want to go to for dinner?
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000 And she says, I don't care where do you want to go?
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000 And I say, oh, I'm actually open for anything.
01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000 I had a late lunch or not that hungry.
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.000 And I know you have an eating today.
01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000 So whatever you want, it's good with me.
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000 And then she says, no, I, you make the call.
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000 Right.
01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000 I mean, how long may you do that for?
01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000 First, I say, cool.
01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000 Sounds like we're going to raglands.
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000 Right.
01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000 And then she's going to go, I didn't want that.
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.000 Okay, cool. What did you want then?
01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000 I actually wanted whatever.
01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000 So would it be, in a based off that hypothetical scenario, would it be actually even
01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000 Wiser to have not just maybe like three to four different options?
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:24.000 Maybe pre contemplated that kind of follow her into just a little bit too.
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000 Yeah.
01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000 Yeah.
01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:34.000 You know, you can, you can, she's wanting to make you feel like it was your call.
01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:38.000 So then you just say, hey, how about we go to whatever.
01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.000 The place that you know she likes and she goes, oh, okay, that'd be great.
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000 Cool. What did I, we're good?
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000 Yes.
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000 No big deal.
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:44.000 So let me go on.
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000 Because I feel like I'm going to read that much into this.
01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000 What don't I don't make this into that big of a deal?
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000 Well, I feel like it kind of can be sometimes.
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000 That's the thing.
01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000 It definitely can be.
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000 And not so much the restaurant thing.
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.000 I'm saying in general.
01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:59.000 So like, you know how, okay, so here's the commenting in my household,
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000 where, you know, it becomes four,
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000 thirty, five o'clock.
01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:08.000 Right. So here comes Mrs. Charles saying, hey, what are you thinking for dinner?
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.000 Now, usually that's your jam usually she kind of, hey, I'm thinking this for dinner.
01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000 I'm always pretty much always like good, you know why?
01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000 Because I don't have any preference. I don't want to make that decision.
01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000 I'm thinking about other stuff to be honest.
01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.000 Is it a big deal?
01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000 No, it's not a big deal.
01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000 But I am thinking about this stuff.
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:25.000 Yeah.
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000 It makes it a lot easier for my brain.
01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000 His feet wasn't maybe to not have to make that decision.
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000 Right.
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.000 Now, I do understand that sometimes she's in that same boat too,
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000 because she was thinking about a lot of stuff and sometimes not all the time.
01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000 Actually, not mostly time, but sometimes she doesn't want to make that decision as well.
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000 She'll make that dinner.
01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000 Yeah.
01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000 But she doesn't have to think something up that everyone's going to like, and I understand.
01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000 Right.
01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000 So that's the thing.
01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000 It can be a thing.
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:55.000 So sometimes people do just want you to make the decision.
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000 Cool.
01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000 You make one.
01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000 See, no big deal.
01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:58.000 Yeah.
01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000 That's what I was saying.
01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000 You got to tell me.
01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000 You got to tell me.
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000 You got to tell me.
01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000 I hate to go this hard to spread this much time, but like,
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.000 if my wife says to me,
01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000 well, no where do you want to go?
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000 Yeah.
01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000 And I say where I actually want to go.
01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000 Yeah.
01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000 And she doesn't want to go there.
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000 I'm going to just look at her face and be like, Oh, that's a bad call.
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000 So I'm probably going to say, actually, I feel like going to name one of her three
01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000 favorite restaurants and then we're going to go.
01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000 There you go.
01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000 But then take some pre-contemplation.
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000 I don't know.
01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000 I really don't have like a bunch of different restaurants.
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000 And you're either one of us doesn't have some big list.
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000 You know, some good to look at.
01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:42.000 The funny thing about my wife is she'll be like, she'll, she'll stray from the,
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.000 from the lesson learned, which the lesson learned to me is the lesson learned to me is,
01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:50.000 I'm going to a restaurant that I already know that I already know.
01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000 I'm going to get what I already know.
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000 Like, that's what I'm doing.
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000 Yeah.
01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.000 I'm going to the restaurant that I know.
01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000 I'm going to get what I already know.
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:04.000 My wife will sometimes wish he needs a re-learning lesson, which is, oh, she want to try this new place.
01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000 So I'm going to a new place with her.
01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:12.000 And then as soon as she takes her first bite of the main course, she's looking at me like lesson learned again.
01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000 Right?
01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000 Because that's face it.
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000 Now occasionally, do you find a winner?
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.000 Like a certain restaurant to put in the mix?
01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000 Sure.
01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000 Can find that new restaurant to put in the mix?
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000 What is that word?
01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000 What do you mean?
01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000 What do you mean?
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000 That's what I'm saying, whatever, like that's not true. Because it's probably true.
01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000 But I'm saying, what do you mean it's probably true?
01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.000 It is.
01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000 How often do you go to restaurant?
01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000 You're like, oh, wow, put this one in the mix.
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.000 Me?
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.000 I don't know.
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000 I don't know.
01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000 But that's true.
01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000 You just be going 100 to restaurants.
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000 You have a list of 100 to restaurants that you be going to all the time.
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.000 Because every restaurant you go to, just in the mix now.
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:44.000 Yeah.
01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.000 To me, all sushi restaurants with the exception of two are in the mix.
01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000 Yeah, it's true.
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000 But my point is, is it the whole gone, hold on.
01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000 There is there a hierarchy?
01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000 Yes.
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000 See?
01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000 So why would you not go on a top three to five at the most?
01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.000 Oh, there's, there's the hierarchy isn't based on like how good it is.
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000 Oh, then it's based on other stuff.
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000 It's based on the house.
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.000 Exactly.
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000 Delivery, maybe some price scenarios and all this stuff.
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000 That's how the hierarchy is based.
01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000 Okay. So the hierarchy's there.
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000 So why are you playing around online?
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000 Because that's not the point.
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000 The point isn't what I do specifically.
01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000 That's the only way.
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000 You do specifically.
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000 Because we're both in unique situations.
01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000 I think I'm saying, generally, it is.
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.000 You don't think there's other dudes out there that go out for dinner with her wife.
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000 Sometimes that makes us unique.
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.000 Oh, that part is unique.
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.000 Okay. What's unique?
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000 The part that you freaking, you got to wonder,
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000 I'm sure on in your wife is that certain way that's,
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000 I think the typical person is more to it than that.
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000 That's what I think.
01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000 You know, I know that I'm not normal.
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000 Right?
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000 I know.
01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000 So I know that it's not normal to just be like,
01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000 Oh, I want to go to the same three restaurants over and over again.
01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000 And get the same exact food by the way.
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000 I do the same thing.
01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000 There's so rare that I have the,
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000 I can't even remember the last time I fought to myself.
01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000 Oh, it'd be great to go out and try something new.
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.000 Okay.
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:04.000 So there's probably some psychologists doing an assessment right now as I'm talking and figuring out,
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000 like, oh, he's got fear of whatever.
01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000 And I don't think so.
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:12.000 I think I just, when I'm going to go out and I'm going to invest,
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000 like, I don't want to get in the car.
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000 I don't want to drive somewhere.
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000 I don't want to go wait.
01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000 I don't want to put on shoes or whatever.
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000 Yeah, rather just be careful.
01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000 Yeah, rather just be careful.
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000 Careful, right?
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000 So why are we doing this?
01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000 Well, we're doing this because whatever.
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000 It's, it's a good night.
01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000 You know, my wife doesn't feel like whatever.
01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000 We didn't, whatever.
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000 She doesn't feel like whatever.
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.000 Okay.
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000 So we're going to go out somewhere.
01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000 So I'm going to go somewhere that I know.
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000 Yeah.
01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000 That's cool.
01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000 And I get something that I already know.
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000 I could feel you for him.
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000 It's unusable for the typical person is what I'm saying.
01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000 Hey, let me ask you this because I don't eat sushi.
01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000 How much variance is there in one of the sushi quality?
01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000 Yeah.
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000 Yeah, big variety.
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000 So bro, how can you say that you're not like you got your top three?
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000 Because the variance, I don't care that much about you.
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000 Okay, how often are you like, oh cool.
01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000 There's another one over here.
01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000 Let's go, let's go order from that one.
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000 We've never been to before.
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000 Not for the purpose of that it's new.
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000 So I agree with you in that scenario.
01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:13.000 But this is what I am saying, though, where let's say, okay, have you ever heard of the
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000 concept, the idea?
01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000 And then you have, by the way, of someone's a head of the way.
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000 Someone's, hey, let's try something new.
01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:20.000 Hey, we always go there.
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000 That's why it's all right.
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000 That's my wife all day.
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000 That's a lot of people's wives.
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000 And that's my point.
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.000 So sometimes they want to try something new.
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000 But sometimes they don't want that beef over that decision.
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000 They want you to make the decision.
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000 Oh, yeah.
01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.000 So sometimes just for the, just for the sake of it,
01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000 just to get some leadership capital going.
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:38.000 Yes.
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000 Hey, let's try something new.
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000 We went to a joint the other day that was new.
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000 I know what?
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000 It was all, by what?
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000 My wife was all excited.
01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000 And we did, like we got in a car.
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.000 It drove somewhere.
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000 Okay.
01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000 And she was, he, he, man.
01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000 He, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he.
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000 Everybody's all excited.
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000 So, see what he, he, he, he, on this, right?
01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000 And I'm like, okay, so we went up there.
01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000 And we got in there.
01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000 It was like, it was, uh, it, and it was fine.
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000 And now we're driving back after finding parking.
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000 After driving up there, finding parking.
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:16.000 Getting sat down, you know, figuring out the menu and, and you were driving, now we,
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000 now we drive home.
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000 And I'm like, do you ever want to go back to?
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.000 She's like, no.
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000 Yeah.
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000 So think about that.
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000 But that doesn't mean that it was, it's a bad way to think.
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000 Venture.
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.000 Right.
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.000 So basically, you're hitting me.
01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000 What you're hitting me with is I need to open my mind.
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:40.000 No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's true.
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000 You should use that as a flank.
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000 It was like me, right?
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000 Tell me, Jocco, you know what you just need to open your mind.
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:48.000 You need to pry your brain open and get some more different food.
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:48.000 Okay.
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000 Well, I, at this point of my life, I'm very uncomfortable telling you what you should do to.
01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.000 I need help.
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000 I'll call.
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000 They know my phone number.
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000 I'm sure.
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000 I said, I want this.
01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000 I want this one.
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000 And they're like, yeah, like, they know like, oh, no, keep it.
01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000 Come on.
01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000 They, they know the thing.
01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000 In fact, there was a new girl there.
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000 She's not doing anymore.
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000 Mm-hmm.
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:15.000 Shout out to Jocelyn, by the way.
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000 Um, and she'd be like, oh, uh, she took my order.
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000 Got it wrong.
01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000 The sushi chef got it right on his own.
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000 Mm-hmm.
01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000 That's how, saying like, you made it.
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000 No, we're all because of that.
01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:28.000 But he said that with a lot of pride, bro.
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.000 You're like, oh, a lot of pride.
01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000 That is not the point.
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000 The point is, I'm with you on the whole.
01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000 I go the same spot and get the exact same thing every single time.
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000 100%.
01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:44.000 My question was with you answered by the way with your, your, uh, your anecdote is sometimes.
01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.000 You sure, as a tradition, not traditional.
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:53.000 As a silent leader, you want to go with the other person's plan.
01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000 But sometimes they don't want that beef of you coming coming up with a plan.
01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000 So you're going to have to plan the plan.
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000 If I can't, and it better not be the same exact plan sometimes.
01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000 But she's the thing.
01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000 My wife knows that if she asked me for a plan, she knows what we're going.
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000 Where is going to, you know, we're in a raglan.
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000 What up?
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000 But hey, here's the other thing.
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000 We already talked about this.
01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:15.000 I have to calculate the emotions in the situation.
01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.000 Yes sir.
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000 So if my wife's like, oh, you know, it's been a long week.
01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000 I really just want to do something nice tonight.
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000 You know what that means?
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000 Yeah, I mean, she wants to like go to somewhere.
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000 Maybe we haven't been for big risk for me.
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000 Yes sir.
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000 I know it.
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000 I got to calculate my my emotions, which can be controlled.
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000 Her emotions, which I can't control.
01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:47.000 But also, but also, but also, but also, I'm going to look at it and say, oh, my wife is probably going to be excited if we go to a new venue that we haven't been before.
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.000 So she's going to be, it's going to be a positive emotion for I put that in the calculus.
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000 I also have to put in the calculus.
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000 Like, I had my week was good.
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.000 I'm not that busy.
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000 Whatever.
01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000 Okay cool.
01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.000 I got some time tonight.
01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000 I'm not going to be mad.
01:23:58.000 --> 01:23:59.000 So cool.
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000 Oh yeah, it's a good night to roll down there.
01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:05.000 And also, if the calculus is, my wife's going to be super happy.
01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000 And I'm going to be super angry.
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.000 That's no factor.
01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000 Because I can just be like, cool.
01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000 I'm just going to enforce myself to have a good time and no factor.
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000 So I'm not going to, I'm not going to let it dictate, but I have to calculate the emotions on both sides.
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000 My emotions in the calculus, barely count.
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000 I'm going to say that again.
01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000 My emotions in the calculus barely count.
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000 And I don't hold the grudge.
01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000 I don't mope around that night.
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000 I don't go to restaurants and say, see, I told you, no.
01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000 My emotions barely count.
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.000 What counts is my wife's emotions.
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000 Or my employees' emotions.
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000 Or my boss' emotions.
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000 I have control over my emotions.
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:46.000 Therefore, they have very little, little say in the calculus.
01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000 I think I get it now.
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000 For real. Okay. Okay.
01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000 It's correct me from wrong.
01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:56.000 Because it's pretty, if I got this correctly, I'm talking out and make sure I got it.
01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000 That was pretty genius.
01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000 I think what you just kind of demonstrated.
01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000 Okay. So in my scenario, I put that up anyway.
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000 Where?
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000 My wife wants to go somewhere new.
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000 But she doesn't want to think about where to go.
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000 She doesn't want to make the decision.
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000 She doesn't want to figure it out.
01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000 She wants me to go.
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000 Even though I might not even want to go somewhere new.
01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000 Or maybe I do, but I'm for sure.
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000 Now, don't they just go one level deeper?
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000 That's too conflicting.
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000 Plans right there.
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000 Isn't it? Because her plan is do something new without having to make the decision.
01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000 That's the plan.
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.000 Okay.
01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:29.000 So it's like, hey, let's go with that plan.
01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000 As opposed to my plan would be like, no, we'll go to the same spot.
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000 Or no, I don't want to go.
01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000 That would be my plan.
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000 Okay.
01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:41.000 So essentially, you just went one level deeper where the decision to make the decision is part of the plan.
01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000 That's the decision.
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000 Yeah.
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:43.000 Exactly.
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000 So you go with the plan.
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000 I'm making a decision on a new place.
01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:47.000 I'm making a plan.
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:47.000 Yeah.
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000 So it's a win-win.
01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000 That's what we're doing here.
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:50.000 Yeah.
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000 Yeah.
01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000 Yeah.
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000 That's like coming to the top of the scene.
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000 That stuff all works out at the end.
01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:01.000 That's the way it all is it's all a unified theory.
01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000 It's a unified, you know what a unified theory is?
01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000 It's like a theory of everything.
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000 Yeah.
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000 All the stuff that I'm talking about.
01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000 It's a unified theory.
01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000 And if you pull the thread on it, it'll be like, oh.
01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000 Yeah.
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000 So you are executing her plan.
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000 That her plan was to have you come up with the plan.
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000 Okay.
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000 So let me just add a new restaurant.
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:22.000 This is me echo telling you, Jocco this.
01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:28.000 Oh, um, the member, how I said like the number one most valuable thing, not the only one.
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000 The number one most valuable thing, not the only one.
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:34.000 The number one most valuable thing that I learned from the, essentially, the long game versus the short game and how that's in play.
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000 Okay.
01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:40.000 So the updated version of that, which happened to a while ago as well, which it might be just more of the same really.
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:44.000 But basically it goes like this, a more unified expression.
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000 I'll say.
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:52.000 In life and everything you do, whatever pretty much, there's going to be a short game being played and a long game being played.
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000 Most people that default to the short game, for sure.
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000 But it's going to be short game.
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000 There's going to be long game.
01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.000 There's also with everyday interactions with everything you do.
01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000 There's going to be a small picture.
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000 And then there's going to be a big picture.
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:09.000 And I think that bigger picture, like that was an example of like just look at it one level bigger.
01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000 It's like, you can't, we're not going with her plan to what restaurant it is.
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000 The decision for the restaurant is part of her plan.
01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000 Yeah.
01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000 Yeah.
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:27.000 And just just kind of FYI, saying the big picture and saying long term and saying strategy versus attackers.
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000 All those are interchangeable.
01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.000 Not completely interchangeable, but essentially interchangeable.
01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000 They're different ways of saying the same thing.
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.000 I mean, when I would talk to one of my guys, I might not say, hey, think about this from a strategic perspective.
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000 I might say, hey, you've got to think about the big picture.
01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000 And I'm not saying a bigger map, right?
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000 I'm saying over the longer term.
01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.000 So you're right that it's a different way of expressing the same thing.
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000 And maybe we could find some nuance.
01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:02.000 Maybe we will find some nuances on the paid picture versus the long term versus the strategy.
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:09.000 But essentially, they're all meeting the same thing and they're all a good place to focus.
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:23.000 And, you know, with that, these are things that we're talking about to apply to really everything that you're in your life,
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:31.000 from picking restaurants, to picking employees, to picking plans, to figuring out where you're going to go in six months and a year.
01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:35.000 And a year and two years to figure out what you're doing with your own personal health.
01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000 To figure out everything.
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.000 And in order to do that, you have to detach that is the first step that you got to take.
01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000 Don't get emotional.
01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000 Listen to what people have to say.
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000 Keep your damn ego in check.
01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000 It's there.
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000 The hardest thing about the ego is you don't know it.
01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000 It's like the air that you breathe.
01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.000 There and you don't recognize it until you go, oh, hold on a second.
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000 If you start to inhale something that stinks, then you notice it.
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000 Other than that, you don't really notice it.
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000 That's what's going on with your ego.
01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000 So you've got to be careful of it.
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000 And then keep that mind open.
01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000 Because that's where you get the new ideas and that's where you figure things out.
01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:27.000 And if you do that when you detach, then your ability to see.
01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.000 Will increase exponentially.
01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000 You can't.
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:37.000 It's like if you didn't have you had bad vision.
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000 And one day you put on glasses.
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:41.000 And you could see.
01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:43.000 Like that is.
01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000 Or you know, one day you're walking around you put some dirty,
01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000 chipped up sunglasses on that were old and crappy.
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000 And you have sunglasses like that.
01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:58.000 I got some sunglasses like that. And you're just wearing them because it's sunny out or whatever,
01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000 but there's nothing really that you're doing is cruising.
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000 But then all of a sudden, some happens where you need to see.
01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.000 And you lift up those glasses and everything comes real clear.
01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000 That's like what detachment does.
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000 It's it's an amazing.
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000 It's a superpower.
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:17.000 And it gives you an amazing advantage in everything that you do.
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000 So.
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000 Detach it, everybody.
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000 That's what we got for you.
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000 Echo.
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000 It's a good way for us to get our minds right.
01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000 What else do we want us to need to think about here?
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000 Our bodies.
01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000 Oh, check.
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000 They're broke my foot.
01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000 I don't know if it's broke.
01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000 But it seems broke.
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000 You're wearing a funny shoe.
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000 Yes, called a post-op shoe.
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:38.000 But you didn't get up.
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.000 No, up.
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000 Just the shoe.
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000 Okay.
01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000 I think it was like a turf tow gone wild morphed into more injuries.
01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:47.000 Because I've been doing a barefoot kind of scenario.
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000 You know, you work out like explode into your foot and stuff.
01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:51.000 I hear good things.
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000 And it was working out for me.
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000 Until.
01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000 Well, that was the end.
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:58.000 Until I was doing burpees on the cement going hard.
01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000 So you know when you drop the, you know, burpees, you can do them differently.
01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000 But I do the kind of where like, they're almost like sprails, but I don't sprawl
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.000 and my hip or not.
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:09.000 It's just on my hand hands and feet.
01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000 That's it.
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000 Nothing else touches.
01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000 So it's like there's some pressure.
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000 Yeah.
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000 The pressure.
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000 Barefoot cement boom.
01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000 Hurts.
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000 No problem.
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000 Was it one impact you like out?
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000 So it was the hole.
01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000 The next day I was like, let it work.
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000 Yeah.
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000 So the next day I was jammed up.
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000 But I could still do barefoot squats and then the next.
01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000 And actually wasn't right.
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000 The next day it was like maybe a day or two later.
01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:36.000 And bro, the next day after that, I was couldn't walk and my foot ballooned up.
01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000 And I wouldn't go away, bro.
01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000 Anyway, I'm jammed up a little bit.
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000 But it does focus your brain on alternative stuff.
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000 No.
01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000 What's the what you've been focused on?
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000 The nutrition element.
01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000 The nutrition element.
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000 The nutrition.
01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000 So it's a big deal.
01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.000 It helps with healing way more night and day, by the way.
01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000 And sleep.
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000 Oh, but yeah.
01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000 So yeah.
01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000 Boom.
01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000 That's what's going on with me.
01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.000 Mm-hmm.
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000 Because I know you're wondering about that.
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000 Anyway, so.
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:12.000 There is such thing as exploring just nutrition, but supplementation can be just as important.
01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.000 What's that percentage of people throw out like on on on nutrition versus exercise?
01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000 Like you can't outwork a bad diet.
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000 Yes.
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000 I believe that that's a good.
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:31.000 Except for when you're 18 or 19 or 20 years old and you're going through buds.
01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000 You could outwork all day.
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000 You can't really eat everything.
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000 Oh, freaking buds.
01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:38.000 Yeah.
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000 You can't.
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000 How do you to buds scenario?
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000 It's not how.
01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000 Yes.
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000 Need to get your grub on.
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000 Yeah.
01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000 Let me send that's what you need to do.
01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000 Yeah.
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000 So if you want to help yourself out, get some milk.
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000 Get something which is a protein dessert.
01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.000 Really.
01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000 Yeah.
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000 All of my things being considered.
01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000 In my case, it was additional joint warfare, additional supercure oil.
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000 That was my protocol.
01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000 Mulk.
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000 I have been going heavy on the milk.
01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000 It does actually.
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000 It jammed me out only with cardio stuff.
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.000 What?
01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000 Oh, the food.
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.000 The food.
01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:12.000 Yeah.
01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000 So I'm still going hard on the mockest at the point there.
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:20.000 Did you see that little video I posted of the new factory down in North Carolina?
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.000 Yeah.
01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:22.000 What was your thoughts?
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000 What on the video of that new factory?
01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000 I know that the video is freaking amazing.
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.000 Yeah.
01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000 That's your assessment of your video.
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:31.000 Yeah.
01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.000 I don't want you to sit here and be like, well, you know, you're angry on this.
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:35.000 I'm angry.
01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.000 Yeah.
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000 I can add it to the meaty eye.
01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000 Yeah.
01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:40.000 Yeah.
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.000 Well, no.
01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000 I don't want your professional assessment of the video there for you.
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000 Yeah.
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.000 So I watch.
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:46.000 Yeah.
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000 So I think I'm, so there's this guy named Jake Tran.
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.000 He's a guy who makes these really cool little mini like documentary on us on YouTube.
01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.000 And he talks about like conspiracies and money and corruption and stuff.
01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000 It's really interesting.
01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.000 Jake Tran.
01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:04.000 And so I had going to rabbit holes every once in a while with his videos.
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:11.000 So a lot of times he'll talk about things like foreign corruption or like, that's where I got the,
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000 actually it might have been from one of these videos.
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.000 I'm not sure if we get it.
01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.000 But we're about to express you know, uniquely priced labor.
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.000 Okay.
01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:26.000 So you get like, you know, and I get it, man, you want to, you know, buy something kind of cheaper and bring it, you know, and sell it for more.
01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:27.000 Right.
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000 And a lot of times part of that discounted price is slave labor.
01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000 The cost of making it.
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.000 Exit slave labor is exactly right.
01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:40.000 You know, do we do they say that when you're making your order from China or whatever, do they say, hey,
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:43.000 you know, like here's all your list items.
01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:44.000 Oh, labor.
01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000 Uh, ten cents a day.
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000 You know, like it doesn't say that kind of stuff.
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000 So it's kind of out of sight on a mind that's facing.
01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:55.000 But yeah, so when I watch your video on a lot of videos, actually the originates to these stuff, it kind of like goes to show like,
01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000 Okay, it creates this bigger picture in your mind about what's really going on.
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.000 Like you don't.
01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:06.000 That guilt and I'm not saying everyone feels guilty about slave labor in other countries.
01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.000 But when you think about it, man, it does weren't some guilt as far as feelings go.
01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.000 Yeah, for sure.
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:19.000 So yeah, when you see like how you guys, you know, origin in that video and a lot of other videos, it kind of, it does make me think about that a lot more.
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:24.000 Yeah, and you know what else is an interesting thing to think about is the environment.
01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000 I was watching something else.
01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:32.000 I was watching Rogue in the other day and I figured who have on, but they were talking about seeing the.
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.000 Rivers are like a river in China and it's dyed blue.
01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:46.000 It's like blue from making denim and they just dump the chemical right into the river and you can't live there because it's so awful and polluted.
01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000 And so yeah, that's why that's why we're doing this man.
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:51.000 That's why we're doing this.
01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000 So and it was cool.
01:35:53.000 --> 01:36:01.000 The thing I liked about showing that factory and that was my first time getting to that factory and the thing I liked about showing is I think it's a good opportunity for people.
01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:10.000 Oh, oh, I people are starting to understand what we're doing, why we're doing it, knowing that it's good for the workers.
01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:15.000 Good for America, good for the environment, good for you as a human.
01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:21.000 So origin USA dot com, get yourself some gear there and you'll be stoked.
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000 Oh yeah, so also speak to the guy, jacos store.
01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000 It's called jacos store.
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000 So new stuff on there.
01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.000 Discipline equals freedom, good.
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000 We got the end of the short locker.
01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:39.000 I talked about this a lot of time, but it is if there's some cool, if you're on YouTube, this is a newer.
01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000 Yeah, well, you know what this is?
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000 Dead's G. I.
01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:49.000 Yeah, but yeah, so there are a little bit different kind of designs, but you get one every month.
01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:53.000 And if you can see the layers, I think that adds to the to the experience.
01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.000 And see the hype. Oh yeah, what's our jacos store dot com, get some of that.
01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000 Also, we have the jacos underground.
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000 We have to have that.
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000 We have to have the jacos underground because look, we don't control whatever platform you're listening to this.
01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000 Unless you're listening to it on jacos underground, which you can do, then we don't control the platform.
01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000 We don't know what they're going to sense.
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.000 So we don't know if they're going to insert ads and force you to listen to an advertisement.
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.000 So that they can make money in the following.
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.000 They make money off of us and you.
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000 And that's not good.
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000 You don't need to do that.
01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000 Don't let them make money off of you.
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000 Come along.
01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000 So yeah, we don't and we don't know if they're ever going to just pull us off because they don't like us.
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000 Because we said something bad about whoever.
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000 We said, we don't like slave labor.
01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000 Well, they want to protect slave labor.
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000 So they pull us off the platform.
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.000 So jacos underground dot com eight dollars and eighteen cents a month.
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000 And you get this, what do you do it like additional podcast on there.
01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.000 And you're talking about things that are, let's say, jacopontcast adjacent.
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000 A Jason.
01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000 Life advice in tips.
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000 You know what, do you consider this?
01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:01.000 Because this is what I kind of thought, you know, like you'll talk about like a.
01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000 Topic.
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.000 Thought.
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.000 You were really, it's like a book called Deep Thoughts.
01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000 It's more of a comedy book.
01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:10.000 The joke.
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000 Yeah, it's like I think from a certain amount of life, right?
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000 Yeah, and then there's a book.
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000 There's an actual book.
01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000 And it's just, it's that, but it's a bunch of them.
01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000 And they're pretty like some of them are like, okay,
01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000 that's funny, but some of them are like, oh yeah,
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000 huh, and you know, you kind of, but these a lot of times the beginning of
01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000 the underground podcast is jacos deep thoughts.
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:28.000 That's interesting.
01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000 I didn't really found that.
01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000 I don't know what it is at all.
01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000 I think that when I think the R is like topics that I come across where I think,
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.000 you know, that'd be cool to talk about for a half an hour or I learned something
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000 that I go, oh, this applies to a lot of different situations.
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.000 I, it's not really jacol podcast, but it's a little underground activity.
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.000 Yeah.
01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:52.000 So there you go.
01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:53.000 That's a jacos underground.com.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:13.000 The master, the battlefield.
01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.000 FTXs.
01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:16.000 I go to some of those.
01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000 So check any of that stuff out.
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.000 And of course, thanks to the military troops around the world.
01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.000 We just went through Memorial Day.
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:32.000 And on that day, we remember and memorialize those that made the ultimate sacrifice.
01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:39.000 And we know that all those who signed the dotted line and swore the oath made a commitment
01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:42.000 to make that sacrifice.
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.000 So thanks to all of you out there who made that oath.
01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000 And also thanks to our police and law enforcement.
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000 Firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers,
01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000 correctional officers, board patrol, secret service.
01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.000 All first responders, you also signed the dotted line.
01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000 And so we're two protect us.
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:08.000 And we are grateful for your commitment as well.
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.000 And everybody else, that's listening.
01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:19.000 You can't see what you're doing if you're actually watching yourself do it.
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000 If that's the only thing you're watching is what you're doing.
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000 You can't see what you're doing.
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000 You can't see where you're going.
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000 You can't see the impact that you're going to have.
01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:33.000 You can only see a few inches in front of yourself.
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000 And you can't make good decisions when you can't see anything.
01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:44.000 And you can't make good decisions when you're wound up and your emotional.
01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:49.000 Then you can't be a good leader or a good person.
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:56.000 If you're allowing any of those things to happen and a lot of times what's driving that is your ego.
01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.000 So don't let your ego get out of control.
01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000 Take a step back.
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.000 Relax.
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000 Look around.
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.000 And then go get after it.
01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000 And until next time,
01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000 Zekko and Joko.
01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:27.000 Out.
