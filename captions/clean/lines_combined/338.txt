00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.16 This is Jockelbodcast number 338 with echo Charles and me,
00:00:04.16 --> 00:00:05.84 Jockel Willink, good evening echo.
00:00:05.84 --> 00:00:10.80 When I was teaching close quarters combat,
00:00:10.80 --> 00:00:15.52 which is, you know, going into rooms, going into buildings,
00:00:15.52 --> 00:00:18.40 and clearing rooms, and clearing buildings, clearing hallways,
00:00:18.40 --> 00:00:21.92 clearing stairwells, there's all kinds of things
00:00:21.92 --> 00:00:25.84 that a seal has to do correctly when they do this,
00:00:25.84 --> 00:00:27.44 and there are a lot of rules.
00:00:27.44 --> 00:00:30.96 A lot of standard operating procedures that you have to follow,
00:00:30.96 --> 00:00:35.12 how you enter the room, where your feet go,
00:00:35.12 --> 00:00:38.64 where you aim your weapon, and where you don't aim your weapon.
00:00:38.64 --> 00:00:44.40 How far you stay off the wall, what you say to your shooting buddy
00:00:44.40 --> 00:00:48.80 when you need to move, what you, how you respond to your shooting buddy,
00:00:48.80 --> 00:00:49.84 when he needs to move.
00:00:49.84 --> 00:00:56.40 There's a bunch of verbal and non-verbal signals that you give
00:00:56.40 --> 00:01:01.12 with your voice, with your weapon, with your posture, with your actions.
00:01:01.12 --> 00:01:05.28 You got to know how to give those signals, you got to know how to receive those signals.
00:01:05.28 --> 00:01:08.56 And then there's a bunch of calls that you actually make,
00:01:08.56 --> 00:01:12.48 and again, some of those calls you make, and you pass that word via
00:01:12.48 --> 00:01:16.000 verbal or other types of visual signals,
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.08 when to move, where to move, what to address,
00:01:22.08 --> 00:01:25.52 in a particular room or in a hallway or in a building,
00:01:25.52 --> 00:01:28.24 because you got to prioritize an execute,
00:01:28.24 --> 00:01:30.16 and you go into room, there's multiple things going on.
00:01:30.16 --> 00:01:32.16 You got to figure out which one's the most important one.
00:01:32.16 --> 00:01:35.36 You got to support your shooting buddy at all times.
00:01:35.36 --> 00:01:36.16 That's covered move.
00:01:36.16 --> 00:01:40.000 You got to do all this with simple clear concise communication.
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.16 You got to make sure that while you're doing all these things,
00:01:42.16 --> 00:01:44.64 you're supporting the overall intent to the mission,
00:01:44.64 --> 00:01:46.72 which is decentralized command.
00:01:46.72 --> 00:01:48.48 So there's a whole bunch of things going on.
00:01:50.16 --> 00:01:51.76 When you're doing close quarters combat,
00:01:54.16 --> 00:01:55.20 and when I taught this,
00:01:57.36 --> 00:02:00.000 there was, you know, we as instructor,
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.12 cadre would get really critical about
00:02:06.24 --> 00:02:08.64 the actions that the guys entering, the room,
00:02:08.64 --> 00:02:12.32 made, because we wanted them to stay tight on the SOPs,
00:02:12.32 --> 00:02:14.96 because imagine you enter a room and you go
00:02:14.96 --> 00:02:16.08 where you're not supposed to go,
00:02:16.08 --> 00:02:18.56 you can get shot by your partner.
00:02:18.56 --> 00:02:21.76 So you got to get guys to do the right thing,
00:02:21.76 --> 00:02:23.28 and then they've got to be able to make decisions,
00:02:23.28 --> 00:02:25.84 they've got to be able to make decisions quickly.
00:02:25.84 --> 00:02:27.44 And so us as cadre,
00:02:28.72 --> 00:02:31.12 we would definitely help on these guys
00:02:31.12 --> 00:02:35.28 and give them firm critique when they screwed something up,
00:02:35.28 --> 00:02:36.88 and you're too far off the wall,
00:02:36.88 --> 00:02:38.96 or you should address that open door first,
00:02:38.96 --> 00:02:40.88 or you can clear behind that couch over there.
00:02:40.88 --> 00:02:42.48 So we're getting on these guys,
00:02:43.68 --> 00:02:47.04 and there's a million points to critique and criticize,
00:02:47.92 --> 00:02:49.92 and we did that.
00:02:51.04 --> 00:02:53.44 And again, the reason we did that was to make sure
00:02:53.44 --> 00:02:54.72 that they follow the SOPs,
00:02:54.72 --> 00:02:57.36 because when you get into a platoon or you're in a platoon,
00:02:57.36 --> 00:02:58.88 and you don't follow the SOPs,
00:02:58.88 --> 00:03:01.68 there's some SOPs if you don't follow them in CQC,
00:03:03.20 --> 00:03:05.76 you can get yourself killed, you can get your buddy killed,
00:03:05.76 --> 00:03:07.68 you can get the everybody killed.
00:03:07.68 --> 00:03:10.80 So we're hyper critical.
00:03:10.80 --> 00:03:13.52 Now, as I watch that,
00:03:13.52 --> 00:03:16.72 as my cadre, as I watch my cadre,
00:03:16.72 --> 00:03:19.76 I sort of detached and would let the cadre
00:03:19.76 --> 00:03:24.56 sort of run those finer points of the standard operating procedures.
00:03:24.56 --> 00:03:25.76 And I got to a point where,
00:03:27.60 --> 00:03:32.96 I would talk to guys when they do something wrong,
00:03:32.96 --> 00:03:37.76 where I'd say, hey, you did what you did.
00:03:39.20 --> 00:03:40.24 Let's figure out why.
00:03:41.28 --> 00:03:43.68 So in other words, oh, echo went into the room,
00:03:44.40 --> 00:03:48.48 and he addressed this door instead of that couch first,
00:03:49.68 --> 00:03:51.12 and I could say, hey, that door was open.
00:03:51.12 --> 00:03:53.68 It's a big, I would say, hey, echo,
00:03:53.68 --> 00:03:57.20 you addressed the couch and you turned your back on the door.
00:03:57.20 --> 00:03:58.48 What were you thinking about?
00:03:58.48 --> 00:04:00.96 Because I wanted to know why you did it,
00:04:00.96 --> 00:04:04.40 so that I can learn more,
00:04:04.40 --> 00:04:06.56 and I can allow me to teach better.
00:04:06.56 --> 00:04:08.64 If I know why you did something,
00:04:08.64 --> 00:04:09.68 and you say, well, you know,
00:04:09.68 --> 00:04:11.92 I thought that the biggest threat was the one that was closest to me.
00:04:11.92 --> 00:04:13.76 Well, this one might be further away,
00:04:13.76 --> 00:04:16.48 but if it's a bigger space to hide
00:04:16.48 --> 00:04:17.92 behind whatever the case may be.
00:04:19.44 --> 00:04:24.08 So, as I learned why people made mistakes
00:04:24.08 --> 00:04:28.000 that helped me be able to teach these things better,
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.48 because then I could close some of those loose ends,
00:04:30.48 --> 00:04:32.56 as I'm teaching it.
00:04:32.56 --> 00:04:34.32 And I took this to other areas of training,
00:04:34.32 --> 00:04:36.08 as well, especially with the leaders, right?
00:04:36.08 --> 00:04:37.68 Especially with the leaders, the young,
00:04:37.68 --> 00:04:39.52 see the leaders trying to understand,
00:04:39.52 --> 00:04:40.64 not just what they did wrong,
00:04:40.64 --> 00:04:43.20 and point out to them what they did wrong,
00:04:43.20 --> 00:04:47.68 but why they did it, so that I could adjust the training
00:04:47.68 --> 00:04:50.24 to address the shortfall, and I could address,
00:04:50.24 --> 00:04:54.000 and adjust my own methodology of instruction
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.48 to make sure that I explained it in a way
00:04:56.48 --> 00:05:01.28 that they understood why we were doing something a certain way.
00:05:01.28 --> 00:05:03.52 So, I need to figure out, I needed to figure out
00:05:04.64 --> 00:05:07.76 what they were thinking and why they were thinking it,
00:05:07.76 --> 00:05:09.36 and I learned a lot from doing that.
00:05:10.40 --> 00:05:13.04 And of course, we would do this type of thing after missions,
00:05:13.04 --> 00:05:14.80 as well, you know, the debrief.
00:05:15.84 --> 00:05:19.12 We get on with a mission, we immediately are going to go do a debrief.
00:05:19.12 --> 00:05:23.12 What happened, why it happened, what we could do better,
00:05:23.12 --> 00:05:27.36 and of course, if we had a someone on the team
00:05:27.36 --> 00:05:30.72 that mess something up, I would talk to them about why they did it,
00:05:30.72 --> 00:05:33.68 not just remo-out because they screwed up,
00:05:33.68 --> 00:05:35.76 but hey, what were you thinking when you made that move?
00:05:35.76 --> 00:05:37.92 What were you thinking, why did you move into that building?
00:05:37.92 --> 00:05:39.28 What did you think was going to happen?
00:05:42.56 --> 00:05:44.32 And, you know, if you read Extreme Ownership,
00:05:44.32 --> 00:05:46.000 the first chapter after the blue on blue,
00:05:47.12 --> 00:05:48.96 of course, we obviously debriefed,
00:05:48.96 --> 00:05:51.68 and we created some new standard operating procedures
00:05:51.68 --> 00:05:55.20 to prevent it from happening again,
00:05:55.20 --> 00:05:57.84 or at least mitigate the risk as much as we could.
00:05:57.84 --> 00:05:59.84 And if you read the rest of the book,
00:05:59.84 --> 00:06:03.84 there were even more situations that we talk about in the book
00:06:03.84 --> 00:06:07.52 that were close to being catastrophic,
00:06:08.72 --> 00:06:11.12 fracture sites, catastrophic blue on blues.
00:06:11.68 --> 00:06:14.80 But we were able to stop those from happening
00:06:14.80 --> 00:06:16.96 either from our procedures that we had put in place,
00:06:17.92 --> 00:06:20.64 or our better understanding of what could unfold,
00:06:20.64 --> 00:06:22.64 or our awareness of what was happening.
00:06:24.40 --> 00:06:26.000 And when I got home from that deployment,
00:06:27.36 --> 00:06:30.16 I debriefed that operation, that blue on blue,
00:06:30.16 --> 00:06:33.84 I debriefed over and over again to the seal teams
00:06:34.40 --> 00:06:35.92 and the platoons that were going through training,
00:06:35.92 --> 00:06:37.36 and the troops that were going through training,
00:06:37.36 --> 00:06:40.16 to try and pass on the lessons learned to everyone,
00:06:40.80 --> 00:06:42.56 and then we set up training
00:06:44.88 --> 00:06:47.68 that we organized the training
00:06:47.68 --> 00:06:51.68 so that those lessons learned would get embedded
00:06:51.68 --> 00:06:53.68 into these young seal leaders.
00:06:53.68 --> 00:06:55.68 They would understand how these things happened,
00:06:55.68 --> 00:06:57.68 so they could prevent them from happening,
00:06:57.68 --> 00:07:01.04 and I was told many times over the years,
00:07:01.84 --> 00:07:06.08 that the training and awareness that we gave people,
00:07:07.20 --> 00:07:10.72 prevented many friendly fire incidences from happening.
00:07:10.72 --> 00:07:13.36 And in case in point Jason Gardner's got a few
00:07:13.92 --> 00:07:16.24 in that he that happened to him on his deployment
00:07:16.24 --> 00:07:19.28 to Afghanistan where he straight up said,
00:07:19.28 --> 00:07:21.60 you know, like, if I wouldn't have been aware,
00:07:21.60 --> 00:07:24.48 we wouldn't have had that blue on blue training,
00:07:24.48 --> 00:07:26.96 that this we probably would have had a blue on blue for real.
00:07:27.68 --> 00:07:28.96 So I heard that many times.
00:07:32.72 --> 00:07:36.72 Now, a lot of people have been asking me
00:07:38.24 --> 00:07:41.44 about the horrific scenario that unfolded
00:07:41.44 --> 00:07:44.56 in Evaldae, Texas.
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000 Psychotic and socio-pathic gunmen entered a school
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000 and killed 19 innocent children and two adults.
00:07:58.16 --> 00:08:05.76 And I can't even fathom the grief and the fact that
00:08:05.76 --> 00:08:12.24 the just trauma for those families, the horror, the whole
00:08:12.24 --> 00:08:16.24 in their lives that they have now that can never be replaced.
00:08:18.32 --> 00:08:27.60 And the potential of life that was thrown away
00:08:28.56 --> 00:08:30.96 before it even had a chance to grow.
00:08:30.96 --> 00:08:36.80 And it's just a completely heart-breaking situation.
00:08:38.24 --> 00:08:43.44 And what has made the situation even harder to process
00:08:45.52 --> 00:08:50.24 was the response from law enforcement on the scene.
00:08:51.76 --> 00:08:58.80 And of course, we all like to think about and talk about what I would have done.
00:08:58.80 --> 00:09:01.52 But I would have done if I were there.
00:09:01.52 --> 00:09:04.80 And I get that, everyone is horrified by what took place.
00:09:06.64 --> 00:09:11.12 And we all like to think that we would have been brave
00:09:11.12 --> 00:09:12.56 or that we would have been more decisive
00:09:12.56 --> 00:09:14.96 that we would have had more situational awareness
00:09:14.96 --> 00:09:17.60 that we would have handled the scenario in a way
00:09:17.60 --> 00:09:19.20 that created a better outcome.
00:09:19.20 --> 00:09:26.08 Of course, we all like to, we would all give anything
00:09:26.08 --> 00:09:30.16 to be able to create a better outcome in that situation.
00:09:32.88 --> 00:09:37.68 And unfortunately, the situation has already happened.
00:09:37.68 --> 00:09:39.28 The outcome is complete.
00:09:41.92 --> 00:09:44.48 And we can't change what happened.
00:09:45.36 --> 00:09:48.80 And what the response was, any more than I could change the decision
00:09:48.80 --> 00:09:52.16 a young seal made when he walked into Roman, moved the wrong way,
00:09:52.16 --> 00:09:58.08 or addressed the wrong threat, I couldn't change what he had done.
00:09:59.68 --> 00:10:03.20 I could tell him what he did wrong, but what I really needed to do
00:10:03.20 --> 00:10:08.08 as I said was to understand why he made that decision
00:10:09.92 --> 00:10:10.72 and learn from it.
00:10:11.84 --> 00:10:14.48 And then figure out how I could teach other people
00:10:14.48 --> 00:10:15.52 to not make that mistake.
00:10:15.52 --> 00:10:22.000 And that is unfortunately the best I can offer in this
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.68 situation as well.
00:10:24.72 --> 00:10:29.28 Now, there are other things to talk about
00:10:30.80 --> 00:10:34.96 with regards to contributing factors in this situation.
00:10:35.36 --> 00:10:38.56 And you've got mental health, you've got media violence,
00:10:38.56 --> 00:10:42.24 you've got dehumanization of people, you've got gun laws,
00:10:42.24 --> 00:10:44.48 and they're enforcement or lack of enforcement.
00:10:45.36 --> 00:10:50.56 And I talked about some of those on the Jocco and Ravling podcast
00:10:50.56 --> 00:10:55.28 with Darrell Cooper and all those, the thing is with all those,
00:10:55.28 --> 00:10:57.04 those are massive subjects.
00:10:58.56 --> 00:11:01.68 Those are massive subjects, all of them that are being discussed
00:11:01.68 --> 00:11:06.80 at the national level and will take some unified efforts
00:11:08.64 --> 00:11:09.20 to solve.
00:11:09.84 --> 00:11:12.40 They'll take some unified efforts and by that I mean people actually
00:11:12.40 --> 00:11:15.52 working together, which we don't seem to have any of.
00:11:15.52 --> 00:11:20.40 So as that conversation continues to take place,
00:11:21.44 --> 00:11:25.20 I just want to look at what happened
00:11:25.20 --> 00:11:30.08 tactically on the ground and try and figure out why it happened.
00:11:32.48 --> 00:11:35.92 And I'm going to use a timeline, follow a timeline from the Texas Tribune.
00:11:36.88 --> 00:11:43.92 It was last updated on June 9th and just just to note,
00:11:43.92 --> 00:11:48.08 we're recording this today on June 13th, 2022.
00:11:49.12 --> 00:11:53.76 And it's just based on simple open source reporting.
00:11:53.76 --> 00:11:58.24 And I'm sure that there will be more detailed information available in the future
00:11:58.24 --> 00:12:01.28 and maybe at some point we'll go over it with more detail.
00:12:01.68 --> 00:12:04.32 But the thing is there are lessons to be learned
00:12:05.28 --> 00:12:07.36 even from what we know right now
00:12:08.32 --> 00:12:12.08 that that I want to talk a little bit about again from the tactical perspective
00:12:12.08 --> 00:12:17.52 to try and figure out why things happened like this in this event.
00:12:18.88 --> 00:12:25.76 So again from the Texas Tribune, this is May 24th, 2022 around 11am.
00:12:25.76 --> 00:12:28.40 The shooter sends Facebook messages.
00:12:28.72 --> 00:12:31.76 The shooter sends private Facebook messages to a girl in Germany.
00:12:31.76 --> 00:12:35.04 He met online and tells her about his plans to shoot his grandmother.
00:12:35.04 --> 00:12:40.96 The gunman shoots his grandmother in the face and calls the police.
00:12:43.60 --> 00:12:46.64 The shooter steals his grandmother's vehicle and drives from his home
00:12:48.08 --> 00:12:51.68 to Rob Elementary School, which is about two miles away.
00:12:54.88 --> 00:13:01.92 So there you have a clear declaration that something bad is going to happen made by the
00:13:01.92 --> 00:13:10.88 individual himself and I don't know if there's some kind of a social media 911 call that you can make.
00:13:10.88 --> 00:13:19.52 It seems like there should be some kind of a social media 911 to call
00:13:20.72 --> 00:13:28.16 where if someone is making threats of violence via social media that people that see these threats
00:13:28.16 --> 00:13:34.80 can have someone to contact where action can be taken.
00:13:36.80 --> 00:13:42.08 And I don't know if there is an AI that can screen for things like this.
00:13:42.80 --> 00:13:50.96 My guess is yes considering that if I Google search something on my phone or on my laptop
00:13:52.16 --> 00:13:56.64 the very next screen that I click I get advertisements for whatever that thing that I just searched is.
00:13:56.64 --> 00:14:03.20 So to think that we couldn't come up with or that the tech companies couldn't come up with something
00:14:03.20 --> 00:14:10.64 that was coming through messages coming through posts looking for threatening content.
00:14:11.68 --> 00:14:13.76 It seems like that would be a feasible thing.
00:14:15.28 --> 00:14:24.08 And at a minimum to have something where there's like a universal 911 call to make if someone is posting
00:14:24.08 --> 00:14:28.64 threatening things it seems like that would be a move that would be over the help
00:14:29.36 --> 00:14:31.60 these when these situations unfold.
00:14:35.36 --> 00:14:39.52 Moving to 1128 AM the shooter arrives at the school.
00:14:40.32 --> 00:14:42.88 The shooter crashes the vehicle into a ditch near the school.
00:14:42.88 --> 00:14:48.000 He fires his gun at two male witnesses who began approaching the crash from a nearby funeral home.
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000 The witness is fleeing call 911.
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.20 So this is at 1128.
00:14:58.24 --> 00:15:05.68 When you get a shooter that's in the vicinity of a school there's got to be a really good lockdown
00:15:05.68 --> 00:15:06.96 protocol that happens.
00:15:09.84 --> 00:15:15.84 And this is something when we talk about lockdown protocol
00:15:15.84 --> 00:15:23.76 one thing that that I think needs to be discussed is if you have a shooter that's
00:15:23.76 --> 00:15:26.56 external to the school lock the doors.
00:15:28.16 --> 00:15:30.16 But when you have a shooter that's in the school
00:15:32.40 --> 00:15:34.24 everyone should get the hell out of the school.
00:15:34.24 --> 00:15:36.24 You shouldn't keep people in the school anymore.
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.96 So having a couple different immediate action drills
00:15:42.96 --> 00:15:49.92 when it comes to when when when when a shooter is either in a school we're going to get out of the school.
00:15:49.92 --> 00:15:52.32 If it's outside the school we're going to stay in the school we're going to lock it down.
00:15:53.04 --> 00:15:56.24 Those require two different reactions not one.
00:15:58.64 --> 00:16:01.52 Because if there's a shooter in the school you should get the hell out of the school.
00:16:06.48 --> 00:16:10.08 1130 AM a teacher calls 911.
00:16:10.08 --> 00:16:17.12 Teacher at the elementary school makes a 911 call reporting the crash and seeing the shooter noting he has a gun.
00:16:18.72 --> 00:16:24.40 The shooter walks toward the school climbs the fence into the parking lot and shoots at the school several times.
00:16:26.24 --> 00:16:32.72 Again, if the shooters outside the school we should have an instant protocol to keep them outside the school.
00:16:32.72 --> 00:16:39.52 1131 AM shooter walks into school parking lot.
00:16:39.52 --> 00:16:43.84 The shooter reaches the last row of vehicles in the school parking lot firing his rifle throughout.
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.44 Police arrive at the funeral home.
00:16:47.44 --> 00:16:53.28 So you remember the people that initially reacted to the crash they ran back to a funeral home called the police.
00:16:53.28 --> 00:16:55.28 The police now arrive at the funeral home.
00:16:55.68 --> 00:17:00.24 A school district police officer speeds in the direction of a person they think is the man with the gun
00:17:00.24 --> 00:17:04.24 reported by the teacher but drives past the gunmen and heads to the back of the school
00:17:04.24 --> 00:17:05.76 mistaking a teacher for the shooter.
00:17:10.80 --> 00:17:14.24 So you have a problem of positive identification now.
00:17:15.52 --> 00:17:21.12 Where you got teachers who are the only adults in the schools except for the shooter.
00:17:21.12 --> 00:17:22.32 So how are you going to tell them apart?
00:17:24.08 --> 00:17:28.32 This is where we look and say hey is there an armband that we have?
00:17:28.32 --> 00:17:34.32 Is there an emergency everyone knows to put on a certain t-shirt or a certain vest?
00:17:34.32 --> 00:17:36.96 And you know you might be thinking all that sounds stupid.
00:17:36.96 --> 00:17:42.64 If you've ever been into a combat situation where there's multiple people running around on the battlefield,
00:17:42.64 --> 00:17:44.48 positive identification is a real problem.
00:17:45.68 --> 00:17:47.68 It is really hard to identify who's who.
00:17:50.08 --> 00:17:55.44 And you can make it a lot easier if you throw if you give people some kind of a uniform to put on where,
00:17:55.44 --> 00:17:58.40 oh all the teachers are wearing a vest that says teacher on it.
00:17:59.52 --> 00:18:00.40 On orange vest.
00:18:11.60 --> 00:18:14.16 11.33 am the shooter enters the school.
00:18:16.72 --> 00:18:18.96 Shooter enters the school for the back through the back door.
00:18:18.96 --> 00:18:25.76 He shoots at least 100 rounds inside classes, classrooms 11 11 and 112 which are connected.
00:18:28.16 --> 00:18:33.84 Authorities originally said a teacher left the door prompt open, but later said a teacher
00:18:33.84 --> 00:18:36.64 closed the door and the automatic lock failed.
00:18:38.64 --> 00:18:41.92 And there's she's the a quote here.
00:18:41.92 --> 00:18:45.68 She remembers pulling the door closed while telling 911 that he was shooting.
00:18:45.68 --> 00:18:49.76 She thought the door would lock because the door is always supposed to lock.
00:18:53.52 --> 00:18:55.20 I've heard some people talk about
00:18:58.72 --> 00:19:04.96 the horrible idea of or what seems like a horrible idea of turning schools into
00:19:07.52 --> 00:19:09.60 you know bunkers type of thing.
00:19:09.60 --> 00:19:11.20 Oh we can have our guards every.
00:19:11.20 --> 00:19:18.88 And look no one wants to bring their kids to a school where the school feels like it's a reverse
00:19:18.88 --> 00:19:22.64 prison right or some kind of a prison environment where you've got barbed wire and you've got bars
00:19:22.64 --> 00:19:24.000 on the window and all this kind of stuff.
00:19:24.56 --> 00:19:26.88 No one wants to bring their their kids to school like that.
00:19:26.88 --> 00:19:36.24 But there is a way to properly secure schools where it doesn't look like some prison camp.
00:19:36.24 --> 00:19:41.28 There's absolutely a way to make that happen.
00:19:42.96 --> 00:19:48.08 And I think that just about any parent I think actually any parent would be okay
00:19:48.56 --> 00:19:57.52 with having some security in place so that the school is a place where people can't get into
00:19:57.52 --> 00:19:58.80 unless they're supposed to be there.
00:19:58.80 --> 00:20:07.52 So the back doors open look does this mean I'm a little bit paranoid?
00:20:09.60 --> 00:20:10.16 Mate yes.
00:20:12.08 --> 00:20:17.20 Yeah little bit paranoid and I think a little bit of paranoia is actually okay.
00:20:19.52 --> 00:20:21.44 A little bit of paranoia is actually okay.
00:20:21.44 --> 00:20:28.56 So that was at 1133.
00:20:30.96 --> 00:20:39.20 At 1135 the the Uvalde police enter the school.
00:20:41.44 --> 00:20:44.96 Three police officers rushed to the same door that the gunman used to enter which was closed.
00:20:44.96 --> 00:20:49.68 They enter receive grazing wounds from the gunman they retreat.
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.08 So response time has been, well 1128 AM the shooter arrives at the school.
00:21:01.84 --> 00:21:06.08 1131 he's walking through the parking lot 1133 he enters the school.
00:21:06.08 --> 00:21:08.64 The police arrive pretty quickly.
00:21:08.64 --> 00:21:15.76 Now if there was some kind of security guard there I guess what response time is zero minutes.
00:21:17.60 --> 00:21:23.04 And does this mean that your kid feels like he's going to school in a in a damn prison?
00:21:23.84 --> 00:21:27.84 Because there's a plain closed security guard there.
00:21:30.24 --> 00:21:31.36 I'm okay with that.
00:21:32.88 --> 00:21:33.92 Do I love it?
00:21:33.92 --> 00:21:37.20 No I don't.
00:21:39.76 --> 00:21:44.64 But this is not that big of a price to pay to keep kids safe.
00:21:46.72 --> 00:21:53.04 The idea that a guard or an armed guard has to be some over presence
00:21:54.16 --> 00:21:56.80 that the kids have to walk by to get to class.
00:21:56.80 --> 00:22:03.20 Oh there's you know Mr. Fred with the with the AR 15 guarding us.
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.96 I feel intimidated because I'm a little kid I don't like I don't like it.
00:22:06.96 --> 00:22:07.84 It makes me feel uncomfortable.
00:22:08.56 --> 00:22:10.96 Does it have to be like no it doesn't actually have to be that way at all.
00:22:13.84 --> 00:22:17.20 There can be a very low visibility option for that.
00:22:19.60 --> 00:22:22.88 And it can be a low visibility option that the children don't know much about but the
00:22:22.88 --> 00:22:30.72 public does know about and therefore it also you it also causes deterrence for a would be school shooter.
00:22:32.40 --> 00:22:39.12 If the would be school shooter knows that there are armed people in the school they're probably going to
00:22:39.12 --> 00:22:40.24 figure out a different target.
00:22:45.68 --> 00:22:49.28 So the police officers enter the school they get shot at.
00:22:49.28 --> 00:22:55.04 That receive grazing wounds they retreat.
00:22:59.28 --> 00:23:08.48 So this is a tough one to with what I know about you know they only were into
00:23:08.48 --> 00:23:11.20 their retreat and that they that they received fire.
00:23:12.32 --> 00:23:14.16 This could mean a bunch of different things.
00:23:14.16 --> 00:23:21.04 This could mean full automatic fire that is at the shooting at the door that they're trying to get through.
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.96 And if that's the case and they proceed and they're just all going to die.
00:23:27.52 --> 00:23:28.40 And now they can't help.
00:23:31.28 --> 00:23:38.64 Or is it some rounds came and they immediately retreated? I don't know. I don't know what happened there.
00:23:38.64 --> 00:23:42.24 I do know this.
00:23:44.16 --> 00:23:48.72 When you're getting shot at you now have information.
00:23:50.24 --> 00:23:52.56 You have very pertinent information.
00:23:54.48 --> 00:23:56.24 You know the general location.
00:23:57.36 --> 00:24:00.96 If you're taking rounds you you know where they're you know at least a little bit where they're coming from.
00:24:03.52 --> 00:24:05.52 So now we can start to formulate some kind of a plan.
00:24:05.52 --> 00:24:09.20 You also know that you've got a high threat scenario and you've got children in there.
00:24:10.24 --> 00:24:14.88 Now you can't just put down cover fire and shoot back at a person in the school because there's a bunch of kids.
00:24:14.88 --> 00:24:16.72 And you can get a friendly fire scenario happening.
00:24:18.96 --> 00:24:24.32 So you can't just lay down cover fire like you would over in a you know foreign country in a war.
00:24:27.92 --> 00:24:31.20 But you know where the bad guy is generally speaking.
00:24:31.20 --> 00:24:36.56 You know at least the door that you're at he has covered which tells you what.
00:24:37.20 --> 00:24:40.24 There's other doors that he may not have covered.
00:24:41.28 --> 00:24:43.44 Meaning other doors where he may not be able to engage.
00:24:45.68 --> 00:24:50.000 So we've tried one entry and we have now an information that we can't get in there.
00:24:50.000 --> 00:25:02.40 So now what are we going to do find another place to go?
00:25:02.40 --> 00:25:03.68 Going back to the timeline here.
00:25:05.04 --> 00:25:11.28 Pete Eradondo the chief of the school districts police department also arrives at the scene around this time.
00:25:12.24 --> 00:25:13.68 He does not have his radios.
00:25:13.68 --> 00:25:22.48 Eradondo wanted both hands on his gun if he encountered the shooter and believed the radios would have slowed him down.
00:25:22.48 --> 00:25:23.52 His attorney said.
00:25:27.84 --> 00:25:31.84 Now that's.
00:25:34.08 --> 00:25:36.72 This is not this is not even a thing.
00:25:36.72 --> 00:25:44.56 It's not even a this is not even a remotely.
00:25:45.12 --> 00:25:46.80 Square to a concept in anyway.
00:25:47.60 --> 00:25:49.44 What the radio going in.
00:25:49.44 --> 00:25:50.48 Get going.
00:25:50.48 --> 00:25:51.92 A the radio told you down.
00:25:53.52 --> 00:25:55.92 B both hands on your gun.
00:25:55.92 --> 00:25:59.60 I mean you don't carry your radio in your hand while you're shooting.
00:25:59.60 --> 00:26:02.24 You have you have your radio.
00:26:02.24 --> 00:26:06.88 You have a mic to to talk into if you need to.
00:26:11.68 --> 00:26:14.80 You going into a situation like this.
00:26:15.84 --> 00:26:19.20 Communication during an event like this is beyond critical.
00:26:20.24 --> 00:26:24.24 There's beyond critical, especially if you're the chief.
00:26:25.28 --> 00:26:28.16 If you're overall in charge of what's happening.
00:26:28.16 --> 00:26:33.92 You are the one person that absolutely needs a radio and you're at so does everybody else.
00:26:36.48 --> 00:26:40.32 Now you don't always sometimes you don't always have every single person with a radio.
00:26:40.32 --> 00:26:45.60 But if you're overall in charge, you're the one that's going to be communicating, receiving
00:26:45.60 --> 00:26:47.68 communications, giving directions.
00:26:48.40 --> 00:26:52.000 You're the one that's supposed to get an overall concept of what's happening.
00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:00.40 Now this is an insane lack of judgment.
00:27:01.60 --> 00:27:06.72 And I would love to pull the thread on this and figure out what actually happened.
00:27:08.32 --> 00:27:14.64 My guess is some the chief didn't look in his car, see his radio and go, you know what?
00:27:14.64 --> 00:27:16.24 I'm going to leave my radio here.
00:27:18.80 --> 00:27:20.24 My guess is that's not what happened.
00:27:20.24 --> 00:27:21.60 That might be what the lawyer's saying.
00:27:22.24 --> 00:27:26.000 As a rationalization well, he thought he might need it.
00:27:26.56 --> 00:27:32.08 He thought it might slow him down and thought that he want to have both hands on his guns.
00:27:32.88 --> 00:27:33.52 On his gun.
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.12 That might be a post-operation rationalization.
00:27:38.16 --> 00:27:44.80 Excuse my guess is that in the panic of the situation,
00:27:44.80 --> 00:27:50.88 he didn't think about it for God.
00:27:50.88 --> 00:27:54.64 By the way, this points to an equally insane lack of training.
00:27:56.16 --> 00:28:01.76 Because no one ever in any kind of scenario ever where more than one person is acting
00:28:02.64 --> 00:28:05.68 in different parts of a team decides not to bring a radio.
00:28:05.68 --> 00:28:07.84 That's not a decision that anyone is going to make.
00:28:07.84 --> 00:28:15.44 I would grab my radio before, if I was in charge, I'd grab my radio before I grab my weapon.
00:28:15.44 --> 00:28:16.08 How you like that?
00:28:22.24 --> 00:28:26.88 So to be in charge and to decide not to bring your radio is
00:28:28.40 --> 00:28:29.36 complete not a failure.
00:28:29.36 --> 00:28:31.44 And you're obviously in some things where they ran some scenarios.
00:28:31.44 --> 00:28:40.88 Like this, the training, if you train one time doing this and you're in charge,
00:28:40.88 --> 00:28:43.44 you'll say damn, I better make sure I have good communications with my team.
00:28:44.24 --> 00:28:50.64 If you do this one time, if you approach a hostile target where there's bad guys in there,
00:28:51.44 --> 00:28:56.72 one time, no hostages, no children, just one bad guy you put him in a building and you have
00:28:56.72 --> 00:29:05.20 you and one other person, you'll make that radio an absolute priority.
00:29:10.56 --> 00:29:14.96 One time, now you take a situation where you've got an active shooter and there's a bunch of kids
00:29:14.96 --> 00:29:19.36 and you've got different units coming in from different places, you're gone off freaking
00:29:19.36 --> 00:29:27.20 need a radio and you would know that if you had any training whatsoever.
00:29:30.72 --> 00:29:34.96 Here's the thing, it takes practice and I know this sounds crazy because everyone's
00:29:34.96 --> 00:29:39.12 look, everyone's on on chair quarterback and everyone can sit there and look, of course, I would
00:29:39.12 --> 00:29:44.16 brought my radio, I'm telling you, I'm telling you this, it takes practice to know this.
00:29:44.16 --> 00:29:50.32 As obvious as it seems to everyone right now, it takes practice, you hear kids screaming,
00:29:50.32 --> 00:29:55.36 you hear gunshots going off, you're the person in charge, you're kind of panic and you go.
00:29:56.80 --> 00:30:01.44 You haven't been trained to the proper level and you go in there with a radio.
00:30:04.80 --> 00:30:07.28 So it's again reflects bad training.
00:30:07.28 --> 00:30:16.72 And at this point, former officers, including a deputy with the county sheriff's office, also
00:30:16.72 --> 00:30:21.28 enter the school at this time. So now we have seven police there against one and again,
00:30:21.28 --> 00:30:26.80 I'm going to need to see the breakdown detail of the building itself of where people entered,
00:30:26.80 --> 00:30:32.88 but you've got more people in the school now. And by the way, by my numbers, that seven police
00:30:32.88 --> 00:30:49.92 against one shooter and I like those odds. Seven against one I like. 1137 gunman fires 16 more rounds.
00:30:49.92 --> 00:31:04.96 Again, you have a school with little kids in it and the gunman is shooting. What that means is you go.
00:31:04.96 --> 00:31:10.72 That's what that means. Let me refer to that. If you didn't already get the signal
00:31:10.72 --> 00:31:17.76 that there's a freaking gunman in a school and you haven't done everything you can to get in there
00:31:17.76 --> 00:31:25.52 and now that gunman is shooting again, that's another blaring signal to get your ass in there.
00:31:30.16 --> 00:31:35.12 And by the way, these are not, these are lessons that have been learned. When you look
00:31:35.12 --> 00:31:39.84 what happened at Column by and they came up with the same kind of conclusions, there was too much
00:31:39.84 --> 00:31:49.44 hesitation, there's too much waiting. When you hear this stuff happening, you have to take action.
00:31:49.44 --> 00:31:55.04 This is exactly the type of scenario where when I start with teaching the young seals,
00:31:55.04 --> 00:32:00.40 I had to teach them to be default aggressive. This is the exact kind of scenario. The problem's not
00:32:00.40 --> 00:32:05.92 going to solve itself. You have to go and solve it. That's what you have to do. And the reason that I
00:32:05.92 --> 00:32:11.12 had to teach them to be aggressive and have that be their default motives because when things like
00:32:11.12 --> 00:32:17.76 this happen, people's natural mode isn't to take action. For many people, their natural mode is,
00:32:17.76 --> 00:32:22.40 oh, I don't know what's happening. I'm going to wait to try and figure out what's happening. That's what
00:32:22.40 --> 00:32:28.48 they're instinct is. And we have to train that instinct out of many people, not all people.
00:32:29.44 --> 00:32:32.56 Some people, you actually have to train in the other direction. Some people have to say, hey,
00:32:32.56 --> 00:32:37.76 hold on a second, you have no idea what's happening. Don't go running in there. Most people,
00:32:37.76 --> 00:32:42.96 you have to train, hey, if it's going on and you can't tell what's happening, you need to get
00:32:42.96 --> 00:32:46.08 aggressive and figure out what's happening. You need to take action.
00:32:50.48 --> 00:32:54.40 And in a situation like this, we're now you have a gunman in the school. It's still shooting.
00:32:54.40 --> 00:33:08.16 It is time without question to do whatever you need to do to get in there. Now at 143 AM,
00:33:08.80 --> 00:33:17.12 Rob Elementary and Yvalday Police Post on Facebook, they announced that the school is under
00:33:17.12 --> 00:33:24.72 lockdown status to do gunshots in the area. By the way, this is like 150 rounds have been fired. The
00:33:24.72 --> 00:33:28.96 students and staff are safe in the building. The building is secure in a lockdown status. School
00:33:28.96 --> 00:33:36.16 officials say in an announcement. So there's no emergency communication in the building.
00:33:38.72 --> 00:33:40.64 And what I mean by that, there's no, there's no
00:33:40.64 --> 00:33:49.12 proword. So in the military, you have something called a proword, which is one word that means
00:33:49.12 --> 00:34:00.000 something that means a whole scenario is taking place. So if I'm out on an operation and we start
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.60 taking fire heavy fire from the target building and we have an entered the target yet,
00:34:05.60 --> 00:34:12.40 I have one word that I can say. And when I say that one word, everybody knows what to do.
00:34:13.12 --> 00:34:17.44 Everyone knows that there's no friendlies in the building that the target building is shooting
00:34:17.44 --> 00:34:20.64 heavy fire at us. I can say one word and everybody knows what to do.
00:34:21.92 --> 00:34:26.32 If we have people in the target building, we start taking fire. I have one word I can say and everybody
00:34:26.32 --> 00:34:33.28 knows what to do. So there's a breakdown of communication here because no one has put out,
00:34:33.28 --> 00:34:37.92 hey, there's a freaking shooter in our school that's gunning people down.
00:34:40.32 --> 00:34:49.92 No one knows this. So no one knows what's happening. So as you think through these scenarios,
00:34:49.92 --> 00:34:53.20 you need to come up with some pro words so that everyone understands what's happening.
00:34:55.92 --> 00:35:00.80 At the same time, the Valdi Police Department posts on Facebook, large police presence at
00:35:00.80 --> 00:35:07.84 Rob Elementary, we ask the public to avoid the area. So there's not communication between the
00:35:07.84 --> 00:35:11.52 school and the police. Do are there police radios in the school?
00:35:14.64 --> 00:35:23.76 That seems like a really obvious question, but does the school have the ability to
00:35:23.76 --> 00:35:31.68 communicate with the police directly through radios? Because this is not a very hard thing to figure out.
00:35:32.40 --> 00:35:34.16 It's not a very costly thing to figure out.
00:35:40.80 --> 00:35:52.08 1144 AM, the police officers are inside. Police with with the city of Uvaldi are and the school district
00:35:52.08 --> 00:35:58.80 are inside the school. This is 1144. Uvaldi police officers enter the building where the shooter is
00:35:58.80 --> 00:36:06.32 from the north entrance. They hear gunfire, our shot at, move back and get cover.
00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.36 Again, if you're getting shot at, you now have a general idea of where the shooter is.
00:36:15.36 --> 00:36:22.80 If you have a general idea where the shooter is, then it's time to maneuver. It's time to flank.
00:36:25.84 --> 00:36:29.36 A shooter can only cover so many different directions at the same time.
00:36:30.96 --> 00:36:37.84 And how do I know that? Because I've been on both sides of those scenarios.
00:36:37.84 --> 00:36:47.44 When you train properly, you not only act as the good guys, you spend time as a bad guy.
00:36:49.52 --> 00:36:52.48 So you start to realize what works and what doesn't work.
00:36:55.36 --> 00:36:56.80 That's the benefit of training.
00:36:56.80 --> 00:37:09.52 Back to the document. Around this time, Eradondo and another Uvaldi police officer enter the building
00:37:09.52 --> 00:37:15.28 through the south entrance. Eradondo witnesses the gunfire. He then checks the door to the
00:37:15.28 --> 00:37:20.56 classroom that the shooter is in finding it locked. He uses his cell phone to call for squad teams,
00:37:20.56 --> 00:37:28.16 snipers, extrication tools, and keys to the classrooms.
00:37:30.56 --> 00:37:41.92 This is at 11.44. So all this is taking place for almost over 20 minutes. This has been going on.
00:37:41.92 --> 00:37:46.000 And only now we're getting a call for squad team snipers, breaching tools.
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:55.60 And it's on the cell phone. How why are we making calls on a cell phone?
00:37:57.12 --> 00:37:57.84 Why is that happening?
00:38:01.92 --> 00:38:05.12 We have radios. There's a reason you have radios direct communication.
00:38:06.56 --> 00:38:10.40 In Centanius immediate direct communication to a whole net of people.
00:38:10.40 --> 00:38:14.32 Oh, that's right. Well, he doesn't have his radios.
00:38:16.88 --> 00:38:18.000 So he's making cell phone calls.
00:38:27.68 --> 00:38:30.08 It says a niche. There's a quote in here.
00:38:30.08 --> 00:38:34.48 Initial officers are there and receive gunfire. Therefore, do not make entry.
00:38:34.48 --> 00:38:41.12 Officers call everyone in the area for additional resources. Tactical teams, equipment, specialty
00:38:41.12 --> 00:38:47.92 equipment, body armor, precision riflemen, and negotiators. They're evacuating students and teachers
00:38:47.92 --> 00:38:54.40 during this time. And this is from Victor Escalon, a DPS official during a press conference on May 26.
00:38:54.40 --> 00:39:05.44 From the very beginning of this whole thing, you clearly have an active shooter that needs to
00:39:05.44 --> 00:39:13.76 be hunted down and killed. That's completely evident from the first moments.
00:39:14.88 --> 00:39:18.56 As soon as a car crashes and two guys go to help and they and he gets shot at,
00:39:19.68 --> 00:39:23.92 or those two guys get shot at by someone who then maneuvers towards a school,
00:39:23.92 --> 00:39:27.68 this is an active shooter situation and someone needs to hunt this guy down and kill him.
00:39:30.08 --> 00:39:32.88 And that's the mode that needs to be gone into instantaneously.
00:39:35.68 --> 00:39:38.16 And there's going to be risk.
00:39:42.80 --> 00:39:45.36 There's going to be risk when you're going up against someone with a gun.
00:39:45.36 --> 00:39:51.28 There's a risk that you're going to die. And that's what we in the military and law enforcement
00:39:51.28 --> 00:39:57.68 sign up for. And we have to think through that actually and you have to train for that.
00:39:58.88 --> 00:40:02.88 And the first time that you think about getting shot and the probability that you get shot
00:40:03.52 --> 00:40:06.80 shouldn't be in an actual gunfight. This shouldn't be the first time this is going through your head.
00:40:10.48 --> 00:40:15.76 You should do training and you need to do training, where you understand what you're going to
00:40:15.76 --> 00:40:21.36 be put up against and you should understand what that feels like and you should either get over it
00:40:21.36 --> 00:40:24.16 and accept that as part of your job or you should get a different job.
00:40:37.44 --> 00:40:43.68 1148. There's an officers' wife is shot.
00:40:43.68 --> 00:40:52.96 So you've got the CISD police officer, Ruben Ruiz, can be heard telling other officers as he arrives
00:40:52.96 --> 00:40:57.28 inside the school that his wife, even Morrellis, has been shot.
00:40:57.28 --> 00:41:10.72 So you look at this woman, the school teacher just seemed like an amazing human.
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.52 She's got pictures, there's pictures of her. She's outdoors, she's enjoying life, she's out
00:41:19.52 --> 00:41:26.48 running, she's hiking, she's doing Spartan races, she's doing CrossFit, she's just seems like an awesome woman
00:41:28.32 --> 00:41:34.80 and had a daughter with Ruben Ruiz. So he gets word that she shot.
00:41:41.20 --> 00:41:48.64 1151 AM, Mor police arrive, more law enforcement officials arrive at the scene again.
00:41:48.64 --> 00:41:55.60 So what are we doing at this point? Who is running things at this point in time?
00:41:56.80 --> 00:42:05.20 Now you got 1520 law enforcement officers, on scene and you got one bad guy.
00:42:07.76 --> 00:42:14.72 That's a fight we can win all day long. All day long. We're going to win and we might take some casualties
00:42:14.72 --> 00:42:28.40 but we can win that fight all day long. 1154 AM, there's an onlooker starts filming.
00:42:32.96 --> 00:42:38.48 21 minutes after the shooter enters the school and onlooker streams a live video showing
00:42:38.48 --> 00:42:49.92 parents begging police to enter the school. Now this is very difficult to watch. This is actually
00:42:49.92 --> 00:42:56.64 sickening to watch. There are parents that are going crazy with frustration. They want to help their kids.
00:42:59.52 --> 00:43:05.28 And in some of these videos, you can see that the parents are being held back by officers
00:43:05.28 --> 00:43:17.36 with long guns, with rifles, with assault rifles. And what they're doing is keeping the parents at bay.
00:43:23.68 --> 00:43:29.76 Now here's what's difficult to understand. Most likely, I can just about guarantee these officers
00:43:29.76 --> 00:43:37.44 that are doing this have no idea what's going on. They probably think they're doing the right
00:43:37.44 --> 00:43:42.32 thing, which is, hey, there's an active shooter in there. My teammates are in there killing this
00:43:42.32 --> 00:43:47.36 guy, so I need to make sure these civilians stay safe. That's what they're thinking. And why are they
00:43:47.36 --> 00:43:52.64 thinking that? Because no one in this whole scenario is detached and connecting the pieces,
00:43:52.64 --> 00:44:00.40 which is what needs to happen when this kind of thing goes down. Someone has got to take a step
00:44:00.40 --> 00:44:02.88 back and piece together what's happening and put together a plan.
00:44:08.72 --> 00:44:14.64 So these parents, you watch these parents, they actually are somewhat detached. The parents are
00:44:14.64 --> 00:44:24.16 kind of detached because they can see that there's why is the shooting continuing? Why is this happening?
00:44:29.12 --> 00:44:36.56 1203, please continue to arrive and a student calls 911 from inside a student calls 911 from
00:44:36.56 --> 00:44:44.56 room 112 for a minute and 23 seconds and identifies herself in a whisper. Meanwhile, as many as 19
00:44:44.56 --> 00:44:52.16 officers are positioned in the school's hallway, 19 officers. And now we know that we got kids in their
00:44:52.16 --> 00:45:06.16 alive and you have 19 officers. 1210, the student calls back. Student calls 911 again and says
00:45:06.16 --> 00:45:14.88 multiple people are dead. So now you know for sure, the shooter is a psychopath that needs to be stopped.
00:45:14.88 --> 00:45:30.24 That's what you know. 1213 PM, student calls 911 again. Student calls a third time.
00:45:30.96 --> 00:45:35.76 The 40s have not expanded on our comments during this call. 1215 Border Patrol Tactical
00:45:35.76 --> 00:45:42.48 Unit arrives. Border Patrol Tactical Unit members carrying shields arrive.
00:45:42.48 --> 00:45:50.88 And she looked, ballistic shields are a great, an awesome tool to have. For sure, they're great.
00:45:55.60 --> 00:45:59.20 We're not waiting for this if there's kids that are going to be killed when I wait and for shields to show up.
00:46:05.52 --> 00:46:11.04 1216 PM, student calls 911 once again. The student calls 911 again saying eight or nine
00:46:11.04 --> 00:46:21.28 students are alive. So now we know we got live kids in there and we got more than enough people to
00:46:21.28 --> 00:46:28.48 to make this happen. 1217 oddly enough the school announced there's an active shooter on campus.
00:46:28.48 --> 00:46:40.40 I mean, what's happening in our overall, from an overall leadership perspective between the
00:46:40.40 --> 00:46:48.08 school and the police when we have at 1217 as there's dead children, dead teachers and now we're
00:46:48.08 --> 00:46:59.52 announcing that we have an active shooter on campus. The all-lookers, the parents are now begging for action.
00:47:00.24 --> 00:47:04.64 Here's a little pull out. It's at some point during the standoff, all-lookers beg police to charge
00:47:04.64 --> 00:47:10.88 the school according to the Associated Press. Parents try to break windows and are not allowed
00:47:10.88 --> 00:47:14.88 to immediately be reunited with their children. Again, there's a video of this. It's
00:47:14.88 --> 00:47:20.80 sickening to watch. There's parents yelling out, what are you doing? Get inside the building. Go protect the kids.
00:47:27.68 --> 00:47:40.64 And there's a one mom. One mom, Angelie Rose Gomez. She gets cuffed. She gets cuffed for
00:47:40.64 --> 00:47:49.68 quote, intervening with an active investigation. And I can't even give this woman enough props and
00:47:49.68 --> 00:47:59.04 praise. She, she like pretended to calm down so that they would release her once they released her.
00:47:59.04 --> 00:48:04.40 She distanced herself from the crowd, got away from like all the hype and all the mania. And then she
00:48:04.40 --> 00:48:14.32 jumped the fence, went in and got her to kids out. Meanwhile, she said that other fathers
00:48:14.32 --> 00:48:34.32 got tackled, pepper sprayed and tays. Again, somebody has to take a step back and get
00:48:34.32 --> 00:48:40.000 control the situation and no one did that here. And is there a chance that someone in this group
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.84 of people, one of these police officers, happens to be a really good leader and happens to understand
00:48:45.84 --> 00:48:53.44 what to do in dynamic situations and happens to have the authority and the leadership skill to get
00:48:53.44 --> 00:48:57.52 control of the situation? Is there a chance that someone might have that? There's a chance,
00:48:58.08 --> 00:49:01.28 there's also a chance that no one has that. And that's why you have to train people so that they
00:49:01.28 --> 00:49:07.20 can perform in these situations. And by the way, the training is also screening to see what kind of
00:49:07.20 --> 00:49:11.68 personality people have. And see what kind of shortfalls they have as leaders. And some people
00:49:11.68 --> 00:49:17.68 don't have the cognitive capacity to make these decisions. And some people don't have the
00:49:17.68 --> 00:49:22.88 the cognitive capacity to take a step back. And some people don't have the wherewithal
00:49:22.88 --> 00:49:38.56 to press through in tough scenarios. And so as leaders, we need to know who those people are.
00:49:38.56 --> 00:49:47.76 This mom, Miss Gomez, Miss Gomez, she is that type of person to take action, to be default
00:49:47.76 --> 00:49:53.20 aggressive, get things solved. She was detached enough emotionally to realize she had to get away from
00:49:53.20 --> 00:49:57.20 the mob, get to a position where she can maneuver in. She was able to do this.
00:49:59.12 --> 00:50:03.52 Some people have that natural ability. Some people don't. And I'm going to get to this in a little
00:50:03.52 --> 00:50:10.40 bit. There's also training that has to be overcome. Sometimes people fall into training habits that
00:50:10.40 --> 00:50:18.88 aren't good. So we have to train to the point that we recognize when what we've been trained to do
00:50:18.88 --> 00:50:33.68 isn't working. 12. 19. PM. Another student calls 911 from from room 11. Hangs up when another
00:50:33.68 --> 00:50:43.52 student tells her to 12. 21. Gunman fires again. Authorities say he was believed to be at the
00:50:43.52 --> 00:50:54.16 classrooms door. On a 911 call from a student three gunshots can be heard. This is over and over again.
00:50:54.16 --> 00:51:04.40 Then things that would mean to me as a tactical leader we go right now. There's time after time,
00:51:04.40 --> 00:51:14.16 after time, after time. There's execute criteria. A room full of kids. There's a guy in there
00:51:14.16 --> 00:51:21.76 is shooting. You go. There's not a debate. You go. That's what you do. You go. You go through the windows.
00:51:21.76 --> 00:51:25.68 You breach the doors. You do whatever you got to do to get in there. That's what you do.
00:51:33.28 --> 00:51:38.72 12. 36. Student in room 11. Calls back again. Same student calls back for 21 seconds
00:51:38.72 --> 00:51:47.20 and is told to stay on the line quietly. 12.43 gunman shoots the door. The student tells 9.11 that
00:51:47.20 --> 00:51:54.40 the gunman shot the door. Okay. There's another execute criteria.
00:51:56.72 --> 00:52:03.52 And you do what you have to do to get in there. Windows. You put ladders up to the windows. You crash.
00:52:03.52 --> 00:52:12.72 You crash through those windows. You crash a vehicle into the windows. You shoot the door off the hinges.
00:52:12.72 --> 00:52:27.60 That's what you do. 12.46. I can hear the police next door. Student called 9.11. 12.46.
00:52:27.60 --> 00:52:35.84 Eradando gives the approval to enter. If you're all ready to do it, you do it. He says according
00:52:35.84 --> 00:52:54.72 to a transcript of police body cam footage. 12.46. 12.46. Over an hour.
00:52:54.72 --> 00:53:19.20 12.47. 911 call from a student. Please send police now. 12.50. Border Patrol Tactical Unit Officer
00:53:19.20 --> 00:53:26.40 Breach is the room and uses a janitor's keys and kills the gunman.
00:53:28.08 --> 00:53:33.44 And I don't have any details on how that actually happened yet.
00:53:36.24 --> 00:53:42.72 I know Bortak people, which is the Border Patrol Tactical Unit Bortak. I know them. I've actually
00:53:42.72 --> 00:53:49.76 worked with them a little bit. I've got some reports that they disobeyed orders. People were telling
00:53:49.76 --> 00:53:58.48 them not to enter and they did it. Anyways, good on them. But what I've been saying this whole time,
00:53:58.48 --> 00:54:05.12 go in, go in, go in, go in. And you think to yourself, well, if you go in or you're going to get
00:54:05.12 --> 00:54:09.44 shot, if you go in, is this going to happen? You don't know. But look what happens when these guys
00:54:09.44 --> 00:54:17.84 finally go in. They go in there and they kill the guy. That's what happens. You got to go on offense.
00:54:25.04 --> 00:54:29.04 12.51. Children are moved out of the room.
00:54:29.04 --> 00:54:43.04 12.51. 106 police announced the shooter is in custody because the Border Patrol and they're
00:54:43.04 --> 00:54:52.24 killed them. And then you vowed the police announced on Facebook that the shooter is in custody
00:54:52.24 --> 00:55:08.96 authorities recanted that information later. So, there you have it. What can we learn from this?
00:55:11.28 --> 00:55:16.72 And again, at this point in time, I'm focused on what could we learn from this tactical situation
00:55:16.72 --> 00:55:25.04 that unfolded? What can we learn from it? I know there's a whole bunch of a whole slew of other topics
00:55:25.04 --> 00:55:32.24 to talk about. And those are happening on a massive level. And those will continue to happen.
00:55:34.24 --> 00:55:42.32 But as an area that I actually know a decent amount about is this. So that's what I'm talking about.
00:55:42.32 --> 00:55:48.40 And first of all, and I've been saying this for years, police need more training.
00:55:52.96 --> 00:56:02.000 Police 20% of time, 20% of working hours for police should be spent training.
00:56:03.52 --> 00:56:08.08 That's what should happen. That's what needs to happen. And listen, you think, oh,
00:56:08.08 --> 00:56:12.72 that that there's now going to be less people out on patrol, less police out on patrol?
00:56:12.72 --> 00:56:18.32 They're their effectiveness will more than make up for the fact that there's less police on patrol.
00:56:18.96 --> 00:56:23.04 Who would you rather if you were in a hostage situation with some crazy person in your house?
00:56:23.04 --> 00:56:27.52 Who would you rather have show up 10 untrained people or 8 highly trained people?
00:56:29.84 --> 00:56:33.84 And if you're not sure about that, let me tell you because I guarantee you all day long, I'll
00:56:33.84 --> 00:56:40.48 take 8 highly trained people over 10 untrained people all day. All day.
00:56:46.80 --> 00:56:54.08 And I'll tell you, I am now, I've started to talk to some organizations
00:56:55.36 --> 00:57:01.60 to see how echelon front my company can help do this on a national level. What should this training
00:57:01.60 --> 00:57:04.08 consist of? What are we training? Police in?
00:57:05.92 --> 00:57:11.12 Well, combatives for one thing, shooting, breaching. First aid trauma.
00:57:13.44 --> 00:57:19.20 Deescalation. And anybody that's listening that doesn't know much about the police,
00:57:19.20 --> 00:57:26.000 you might think they do all this stuff all the time. They don't. They don't do this all the time.
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:33.28 They barely get to shoot. I bet you 99% of police have very limited training if any in breaching
00:57:34.56 --> 00:57:37.12 and how to breach a door with a shot gun.
00:57:41.92 --> 00:57:49.28 Combatives, barely any. Barely any training. Close quarters combat, room clearing.
00:57:49.28 --> 00:57:58.64 Urban combat clearance. How do you handle an active shooter? How do you handle a barricade
00:57:58.64 --> 00:58:05.92 shooter? And then you've got to run scenarios. You've got to put people into these situations.
00:58:07.68 --> 00:58:17.60 You've got to get a simulation or some kind of round that can be fired at other people during training.
00:58:17.60 --> 00:58:26.16 You need assets. You need role players so that people get used to it.
00:58:27.60 --> 00:58:33.04 And you absolutely get better. This is exactly what I did for a living.
00:58:34.40 --> 00:58:41.12 Was trained young seals so that they understand what to do in these types of situations. And you
00:58:41.12 --> 00:58:48.56 can watch and see them learn and get better. And over time, they eventually get to a point where
00:58:48.56 --> 00:59:00.16 they know exactly what to do. Yeah, they learn about the basic fundamental principles.
00:59:00.16 --> 00:59:03.20 Cover and move simple. Prioritize next to your decentralized command. They're going to learn about those
00:59:03.20 --> 00:59:07.44 things. They're going to learn about decentralized command, which means when I show up and there's
00:59:07.44 --> 00:59:11.52 something going on and I'm the junior guy, but I'm the first person there. I can make things happen.
00:59:11.52 --> 00:59:18.24 I can make decisions. I know what the priorities are. That's what they learn.
00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.56 They learn how to detach. You've heard me say someone's got to take a step back and figure out
00:59:24.56 --> 00:59:29.36 what's happening broadly. Well, that's what people learn when you run them through the appropriate
00:59:29.36 --> 00:59:33.12 training. They learn how to communicate. They learn the importance of communications. They learn
00:59:33.12 --> 00:59:38.000 not to go into dynamic scenarios without a radio so they can communicate with the rest of their troops.
00:59:41.84 --> 00:59:49.28 This so much of this whole thing was people not seeing the big picture. No one assembled
00:59:49.28 --> 00:59:55.60 the entire scene to understand what was happening. And therefore no one made the broad call that
00:59:55.60 --> 01:00:08.40 needed to be made, which is get in there. Get in there. We're going. And this does take training.
01:00:10.24 --> 01:00:13.68 It does take training. Now it doesn't take training if you're a parent and your kids in there.
01:00:13.68 --> 01:00:19.28 That doesn't take any training. That's instinct. And I'll talk a little bit about that.
01:00:19.28 --> 01:00:25.52 But it takes training. I had experience seals. I would have experience seals that would fail
01:00:25.52 --> 01:00:29.84 to take action when they needed to. And we'd have to have them do that training again. And maybe
01:00:29.84 --> 01:00:33.68 again, and maybe again, until they realize that when they don't take action, everything's going to fall apart.
01:00:37.04 --> 01:00:41.44 So even seals would have a hard time in some cases figuring these things out.
01:00:41.44 --> 01:00:56.000 Now, like I said, the parents that were there, they were detached. And maybe not emotionally
01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:03.76 because they're they're obviously horrified by what's going on. But some of the parents you can
01:01:03.76 --> 01:01:07.36 go watch the videos, they're making matter of fact statements about what was going on.
01:01:07.36 --> 01:01:11.68 They're saying there's kids in there. They're shooting going on.
01:01:16.40 --> 01:01:22.000 Now to this idea of instinct, which I mentioned, instinct versus methodology versus instinct.
01:01:23.28 --> 01:01:30.88 Okay, you have an instinct of what to do. And in some cases, you need to get trained against that
01:01:30.88 --> 01:01:39.20 instinct. It's just like in jujitsu. There's certain things where your instinct is wrong.
01:01:39.20 --> 01:01:45.28 And so it takes some training to teach you to overcome your instinct.
01:01:48.88 --> 01:01:56.16 To learn a methodology that's superior to the instinct. And there are times when the methodology
01:01:56.16 --> 01:02:02.24 is wrong and the instinct is correct. What do I mean by that? I got a story about JP to Nell,
01:02:02.24 --> 01:02:13.92 JP to Nell. One of my guys in my last deployment to Iraq. And outstanding guy, seal,
01:02:13.92 --> 01:02:19.68 sniper, point man, outstanding guy. And when we first started working together, we were out in the desert.
01:02:19.68 --> 01:02:27.68 And we're doing a patrol out in the desert. And the patrol stopped. And I'm looking at JP.
01:02:27.68 --> 01:02:33.68 And JP standing out in the open. He's standing out in the open. Now we're out in the desert,
01:02:33.68 --> 01:02:40.08 but it's not a barren desert. There's rocks and shrubs and micro-terrain features. And we stop our
01:02:40.08 --> 01:02:48.64 patrol and JP standing out in the open. And I walk over to him. And I said, hey, JP, if you were 10 years
01:02:48.64 --> 01:02:56.08 old right now and we were playing war, where would you be standing? And he pointed over to a little
01:02:56.08 --> 01:03:00.16 bush with some rocks rounded with a little terrain to hide behind. And he said, right over there.
01:03:01.52 --> 01:03:09.68 And I said, let your 10s 10 year old instinct. Let it come to life. Let it do its job. That's where you
01:03:09.68 --> 01:03:14.72 should be. I know the standard operating procedure is when the patrol stops. You set down
01:03:14.72 --> 01:03:20.88 a near position in your field of fire. You halt and you stay there. But if you can move six yards
01:03:20.88 --> 01:03:27.68 and have good-covering concealment, that's what you should do. So sometimes people train to a point
01:03:27.68 --> 01:03:33.92 like these police officers probably and I've heard some talk about this. Hey, it's a barricaded
01:03:33.92 --> 01:03:40.56 shooter, which means we he's going to be staying there and we should negotiate. So they got in this
01:03:40.56 --> 01:03:49.76 mode of well-barricaded shooter. We should just negotiate with them. The reality of the situation
01:03:49.76 --> 01:03:52.96 it wasn't barricaded shooter. He was moving around. He was still shooting the entire time.
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.40 That's not a barricaded shooter that's decided to hold up and negotiate for some kind of ransom.
01:03:59.92 --> 01:04:03.12 Not at all. They got stuck in that mode.
01:04:03.12 --> 01:04:12.72 What needed to happen was action. A methodical entry, a perfect entry into the building.
01:04:13.36 --> 01:04:20.56 If you were to plot out the perfect close quarters combat operation for this school and how many
01:04:20.56 --> 01:04:24.64 people you would need and what methodology you would move for the building and what type of breaches
01:04:24.64 --> 01:04:28.72 you would use on the doors and which would be most efficient. All that stuff goes out the window
01:04:28.72 --> 01:04:34.24 when there's an active shooter in the room with a bunch of kids, your instinct needs to be to get in there
01:04:35.20 --> 01:04:39.20 and some of those parents had that instinct. Yelling, get into the building.
01:04:43.12 --> 01:04:48.64 But the training methodology had boxed these guys in mentally. Where they thought, oh well, we don't
01:04:48.64 --> 01:04:55.52 have shields. And this is a speculating at this point. But oh, if we don't have ballistic shields, we
01:04:55.52 --> 01:05:01.12 shouldn't go in there. Hey, we were taught not to go into a shooter situation, an active shooter
01:05:01.12 --> 01:05:06.24 situation without ballistic shields. We're waiting for the ballistic shields. No, that's the methodology
01:05:06.24 --> 01:05:14.16 been talked. It's not working right now. What about the windows? Walking up to the windows, smashing
01:05:14.16 --> 01:05:23.04 a window, shooting through the window. You can do that throwing crash grenades through the windows.
01:05:23.04 --> 01:05:32.000 Put 10 crash grenades through the windows on this guy. There's a bunch of different things that
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.08 if you do what you would naturally do in a situation, you're probably right.
01:05:43.04 --> 01:05:46.56 So what you have to do is you're going to have instinct. You're going to have a natural instinct.
01:05:46.56 --> 01:05:49.28 The instinct could be wrong. The instinct could be right.
01:05:49.28 --> 01:05:53.84 I mean, here's an instinct. What's something shooting? I mean, I'm going to run away.
01:05:54.48 --> 01:05:59.36 And I'm not going to go back. So police officers have to overcome that instinct to go and stay
01:05:59.36 --> 01:06:03.12 and maneuver towards fire. That's overcoming their natural instinct.
01:06:05.36 --> 01:06:11.20 But there's sometimes where the methodology is wrong. And so you have to be good enough to overcome
01:06:11.20 --> 01:06:14.000 your methodology and go if you're instincts sometimes.
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:20.80 Are you, it's another thing I used to say to these young seals.
01:06:22.96 --> 01:06:27.04 If you, I'd say, hey, if you were going to go in that room right now and I was in there and you
01:06:27.04 --> 01:06:31.28 were 10 years old and I was 10 years old and I had a squirt gun and you had a squirt gun.
01:06:32.24 --> 01:06:36.88 And you were going to enter this room. How would you do it? And they'd show me.
01:06:36.88 --> 01:06:42.24 And I'd say, doesn't that make more sense than what you just did and they'd say, yeah, it does.
01:06:44.48 --> 01:06:49.44 But they would follow some standard operating procedures that didn't make sense in a particular room.
01:06:49.44 --> 01:06:52.56 But they would do what they were taught to do even though it didn't make sense.
01:06:55.92 --> 01:06:59.36 And the ability to decide whether your instinct is right or wrong,
01:07:00.80 --> 01:07:05.20 you get that ability by being able to take a step back and assess. And the way you get that ability
01:07:05.20 --> 01:07:07.20 to take a step back and assess is through training.
01:07:13.36 --> 01:07:22.80 And it takes time. And that's why I use that term, that that idea of 20% of time for police officers
01:07:22.80 --> 01:07:30.24 should be spent training. And you're going to end up with infinitely more qualified and prepared police.
01:07:30.24 --> 01:07:43.76 There was a fighting methodology, a combatives methodology, a system that was being used in the
01:07:43.76 --> 01:07:51.20 seal teams. And it was ineffective. It was ineffective system. But one of the reasons that it was
01:07:51.20 --> 01:07:59.36 argued to be a good system was because there was a one week course of instruction of this fighting
01:07:59.36 --> 01:08:04.88 methodology that if you took this one week course of instruction, then you were qualified
01:08:06.72 --> 01:08:13.36 and allegedly prepared for combat. Well, you can't learn to fight one week. There's not going to
01:08:13.36 --> 01:08:22.40 happen. You can't learn good combatives skills in one week. And so I was bringing up to my chain of command.
01:08:22.40 --> 01:08:30.000 Hey, this combative system is ineffective. We should use some kind of a more mixed martial arts
01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.04 combination of jujitsu wrestling boxing, mojitai using our weapons in those scenarios.
01:08:37.20 --> 01:08:43.20 And one of the arguments that I got against that idea was that all that stuff takes years to learn.
01:08:44.32 --> 01:08:47.36 It takes years to learn this stuff. This stuff we can teach people in a week.
01:08:47.36 --> 01:08:53.52 Well, you know what I said to that? I said, well, we're in the damn teams for 20 years.
01:08:53.52 --> 01:08:57.60 Let people get good. You shouldn't tell someone that after a week of training, they're going to be good
01:08:57.60 --> 01:09:06.24 to go. They're not training has to happen all the time. And by the way, eventually, we do have a great
01:09:07.44 --> 01:09:13.36 jujitsu wrestling boxing mojitai based combative system in the seal teams,
01:09:13.36 --> 01:09:20.48 which is you also utilize your weapons, you utilize your gear, but it's based in these things that work.
01:09:21.60 --> 01:09:25.60 And it takes time to get good at. No one says, oh, you've been through one week course. You can handle
01:09:25.60 --> 01:09:37.36 yourself now because we know that that's not true. So it comes down to training. And there's a look.
01:09:38.80 --> 01:09:42.80 Are there a bunch of other factors, a bunch of other things that we can address? Yes,
01:09:42.80 --> 01:09:47.20 there are absolutely are. There are a bunch of other things to talk about.
01:09:49.04 --> 01:09:53.84 But like I said, this is something that I know and something that I understand training people
01:09:53.84 --> 01:10:00.88 for stressful, dynamic, dangerous situations. And that's what we need to do with our law enforcement.
01:10:00.88 --> 01:10:10.32 We need to train them properly. Because we owe it to them. We owe it to our police and law
01:10:10.32 --> 01:10:15.52 enforcement to train them properly. We owe it to the law abiding citizens of this country.
01:10:19.12 --> 01:10:23.68 And of course, we owe it to the innocent children.
01:10:23.68 --> 01:10:44.64 They're just trying to get their freaking education in school. So that's my initial take on this scenario.
01:10:44.64 --> 01:10:56.08 Again, I talked about some of the other factors with their Cooper on our unraveling podcast.
01:11:00.16 --> 01:11:03.60 But I wonder who dressed this here and try and get this word out.
01:11:03.60 --> 01:11:21.52 With that Equitrals. Yes. You know, like, let's have some of these things happen. You hear
01:11:21.52 --> 01:11:28.32 of all these solutions. On the cards and schools, gun control laws. Like, you know,
01:11:28.32 --> 01:11:34.000 everyone has their take. What do you think are some of the solutions that off the top of your head
01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.92 that are not practical or doable or probably wouldn't be affected that you've heard?
01:11:41.28 --> 01:11:47.12 There's a whole slew of things going on. And there's many facets that lead to this
01:11:48.48 --> 01:11:52.08 situation. As far as I don't really think too much about,
01:11:52.08 --> 01:11:58.32 hey, what wouldn't work. And one of the reasons why I wanted to talk about this is this is what
01:11:58.32 --> 01:12:02.32 I know will help in a situation like this. If you train people properly that'll be able to handle these
01:12:02.32 --> 01:12:08.000 situations, if you could snap your fingers and have all the schools, you know, be totally safe.
01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:14.16 Of course, of course, we'll take that all day long. We don't get to operate in fantasy world.
01:12:14.88 --> 01:12:21.04 There's crazy mentally disturbed people out there. And if you haven't listened to that podcast,
01:12:21.04 --> 01:12:27.12 I did with Darrell, one of the most shocking statistics that come out came out from it was
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:37.92 in 1955. There were 340 inpatient beds for every 100,000 people in America. That
01:12:37.92 --> 01:12:48.08 needed mental health help. 340 beds forever every 100,000 citizens. Those beds were dedicated
01:12:48.08 --> 01:12:55.12 for mental health. They had that many available available. They were just not necessarily taken up,
01:12:55.12 --> 01:13:03.52 just available. So out of every 100,000 people, there's 370 inpatient mental health beds available
01:13:03.52 --> 01:13:20.64 in mental health facilities. In 2007, there was 17. Yeah, 17. So that's a 95% reduction in the amount
01:13:20.64 --> 01:13:29.28 of available mental health facilities for people that need help. And by the way, during this time,
01:13:29.28 --> 01:13:38.88 we've added all kinds of other crazy things into the mix with drugs, legal drugs, illegal drugs,
01:13:38.88 --> 01:13:48.56 prescription drugs, all kinds of media violence, whether it's social media, whether it's violent movies,
01:13:48.56 --> 01:13:57.60 whether it's violent videos, all that's added into the mix. The SSRIs, the isolation of
01:13:57.60 --> 01:14:03.76 of being on social media in the first place, the breakdown of the family structure, like all
01:14:03.76 --> 01:14:08.24 these things are happening. You throw those all those things into the mix and then you have less
01:14:09.52 --> 01:14:17.20 mental health available. That's where you end up. It's one of the things that you end up.
01:14:17.20 --> 01:14:22.08 So I don't know if the necessarily answered your question about what would not help.
01:14:22.08 --> 01:14:29.84 I try and look at what can we actually do immediately to try and start getting people in a
01:14:29.84 --> 01:14:35.12 better situation, getting these things freaking moving in the right direction. Yeah, yeah, I was thinking
01:14:35.76 --> 01:14:39.92 because I remember you said something about like you were an advocate of like having an
01:14:39.92 --> 01:14:44.64 armed guard at the school, right? Where they're retired military or this was a while ago.
01:14:44.64 --> 01:14:52.96 And then I remember hearing the option of training teachers or army in the teachers, that's
01:14:52.96 --> 01:15:03.52 what it was. So how do you feel about army teachers? It's the same thing. You need to train the teachers.
01:15:04.32 --> 01:15:08.000 Are you going to train the teachers? Because you got to train the teachers. Which,
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.04 can you train the teachers? Yes, you can. You can train some of them. Someone that want to get
01:15:11.04 --> 01:15:17.12 trained. You know, the armed guard thing, my mom was a school principal. And, and then she was
01:15:17.12 --> 01:15:22.40 a superintendent of schools. And I remember when these school shootings started happening,
01:15:22.40 --> 01:15:29.60 I was immediately like, hey, you should put there should be two dudes sitting in a closet,
01:15:30.64 --> 01:15:35.20 you know, with video cameras, closer to television cameras, they're watching what's going on.
01:15:35.20 --> 01:15:39.60 And if anything ever happens, they come out and they kill bad guy. I wish I would have been
01:15:39.60 --> 01:15:45.12 super vocal about it. Because some of these things would have been stopped a lot quicker.
01:15:47.04 --> 01:15:52.32 And then like I said, there's some people that say, well, what kind of world are we living
01:15:52.32 --> 01:15:56.96 into when we need to? Let me reprise that because I'm using a horrible voice. Some people say,
01:15:56.96 --> 01:16:01.12 hey, what kind of world are we living in? Where we have to put armed guards in a school?
01:16:01.68 --> 01:16:06.80 I'll tell you the world that we created. The world that we created, you need to have armed
01:16:06.80 --> 01:16:14.64 guards in school because we've got some serious issues, some serious cultural and societal issues
01:16:15.36 --> 01:16:22.48 that makes an 18 year old kid want to get a machine gun and go into a freaking school and start killing
01:16:22.48 --> 01:16:32.56 kids. That's what's that's why. So if you say to me, what kind of a world are we living in? Where
01:16:32.56 --> 01:16:38.64 we need to put armed guards in schools? I will say the United States of America. Do I like it?
01:16:39.20 --> 01:16:46.32 Do I like the fact that we have to do that? No. Do I like the fact that I got a, you know,
01:16:46.32 --> 01:16:50.80 wear a seat belt when I drive a car? Because I might crash. I don't really like it, but I'm going to do it.
01:16:54.80 --> 01:16:59.36 I remember I was in high school when they were security there. They didn't have. They
01:16:59.36 --> 01:17:03.12 weren't armed that I knew of, but I feel like granted this is high school, so I'll let me
01:17:03.12 --> 01:17:10.24 just go a little bit different. And I'm thinking back if they were armed, I don't think that would
01:17:10.24 --> 01:17:16.32 have made that much of a difference. If they were like prison guards, like, you know, ordering
01:17:16.32 --> 01:17:20.72 to actually use security guards are pretty mean too to everybody. They were like hosts, you know,
01:17:20.72 --> 01:17:26.24 I'd envision it where they should be nice, like almost like, nice teachers almost kind of a
01:17:26.24 --> 01:17:30.32 thing like shapper on, you know, sometimes teachers get like yard duty. That's what they call
01:17:30.32 --> 01:17:39.36 the school where they got in monitors. It was awesome. No, it's like, well, I'm tired. It's so
01:17:39.36 --> 01:17:43.52 elementary school teaches up yard duty, right, certain ones. And basically they just got
01:17:43.52 --> 01:17:47.76 sight and recess and just make sure no one acts up or whatever. And no one really acts. Yeah.
01:17:47.76 --> 01:17:51.20 Yeah. So what you're talking about is people that are people that are employed at the school
01:17:51.20 --> 01:17:55.28 to keep the students in check. Yes. There's a difference between someone that's at school to keep
01:17:55.28 --> 01:17:58.80 the students in check and someone that's at school to prevent someone from coming to harm
01:17:58.80 --> 01:18:03.52 the students. Yeah. So there's a two different people you'd be looking for. Yes. But in in high school,
01:18:03.52 --> 01:18:07.92 one thing with the security, that's what these, and actually there were ladies, two of them.
01:18:07.92 --> 01:18:14.56 And they were there. Yes. For to keep people in check in all capacities. But what I'm saying is
01:18:14.56 --> 01:18:22.000 maybe one or two levels more advanced, we'll say, is instead of two ladies with just radios,
01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:32.08 they were retired military or guys with guns. Not necessarily over with radios. But their presence is
01:18:32.08 --> 01:18:36.56 kind of known or whatever. It's not intimidating. It's more of a host kind of scenario.
01:18:37.68 --> 01:18:43.76 Like someone who's on the kids side kind of a thing, more so than someone with their eagle eyes open
01:18:43.76 --> 01:18:47.20 for any trouble, that kind of thing. Even though that is what they're doing, that's not their
01:18:47.20 --> 01:18:52.16 presence. That's not what it feels like. Yeah. You need to be careful with that. If you're going to
01:18:52.16 --> 01:18:56.48 have someone that's going to be doing security, they should be doing security. Look, can someone be
01:18:56.48 --> 01:19:02.32 dual rolled? Sure. But if you're going to put someone on security, like their purpose is security,
01:19:02.32 --> 01:19:06.56 you don't want them breaking up fights over potato chips in the school yard. You know what I'm saying?
01:19:06.56 --> 01:19:09.60 Yeah. You want them to be focused on what they're supposed to be focused on.
01:19:09.60 --> 01:19:15.12 The good, is it smart to have people that are dual trained? Sure. But someone has to be,
01:19:15.12 --> 01:19:18.48 if you put someone on security for the purpose of being on security, they should be on security.
01:19:19.60 --> 01:19:23.60 Now, like you said, and like I said, this doesn't mean they need to be walking around with body
01:19:23.60 --> 01:19:31.12 armor, visible body armor, and a weapon, and a salt rifle like posted up. They don't need to be
01:19:31.12 --> 01:19:38.000 like that. But they, I mean, they could literally be sitting in a central location and a closet with
01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:45.20 closed circuit TVs, and when something like this happens, they know what to do. I remember the
01:19:45.20 --> 01:19:52.24 the army, the teachers, um, option, and I remember, uh, kind of talking to some of our friends
01:19:52.24 --> 01:19:56.72 that are actual teachers, and it kind of put things into perspective, because at first I was like,
01:19:56.72 --> 01:20:00.000 yeah, that makes sense. You know, it's not like, you know, give me just a little bit of training,
01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.80 whatever. But at least it's one more good guy in the field, you know, with, you know, who's armed
01:20:04.80 --> 01:20:10.88 in can protect, but then I thought about after talking to some of the teachers, you think about it,
01:20:10.88 --> 01:20:16.16 like who wants to become a teacher, and then now becoming a teacher becomes a whole different thing.
01:20:16.16 --> 01:20:20.000 Like right now it's like, I'm a teacher. I want to teach these young minds, you know,
01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.12 to get to the next level in life, and all this, like basically all the things that people pursue
01:20:25.12 --> 01:20:31.60 being teachers, yeah, over, um, it shifts to something completely different. Yeah, that being said,
01:20:31.60 --> 01:20:37.20 I bet if there was an option where if you're a school teacher, you can go to a four-week
01:20:37.20 --> 01:20:44.000 summer course on, you know, active shooter response, and then inside of a school with
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:48.000 30 teachers, there's three people that have been to this course. I think we're, I think I'm feeling
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.80 good about that. Yeah. Yeah. And then you were a refresher course every summer, and that you know what I'm
01:20:52.80 --> 01:20:59.68 saying, like, you got, you got to train people, you have to train people properly, but people are
01:20:59.68 --> 01:21:04.64 willing to train, because it's beneficial in a multitude of different ways. Yeah, that's it.
01:21:04.64 --> 01:21:08.56 I never thought about that where it's like kind of the optional training or whatever, because
01:21:08.56 --> 01:21:13.28 I was just thinking of it in terms of like, hey, because it's how they, they'd say, I don't, you know,
01:21:13.28 --> 01:21:17.12 they don't go into depth or nothing. They're just like, yeah, I'm the teacher, like all the teachers,
01:21:17.12 --> 01:21:21.76 they got guns. Yeah. So, so to your earlier question is like, what's a solution that won't work?
01:21:21.76 --> 01:21:27.20 The problem with that is the, the problem with that is the details of any solution. You take
01:21:27.20 --> 01:21:32.08 any one of these solutions, and there's certain details that would make it better, and some details
01:21:32.08 --> 01:21:36.64 if you don't include them, are going to make it a disaster. Like you just throw weapons into every
01:21:36.64 --> 01:21:40.64 classroom with random people that haven't been trained, you, you, that's, that's going to be a
01:21:40.64 --> 01:21:45.28 problem. Right? Because you got teachers that are that are that are that micro crazy. Right?
01:21:45.28 --> 01:21:52.08 There's all kinds of things going on. So, you take any of these solutions, and you take it to a certain
01:21:52.08 --> 01:21:57.76 extent. I mean, some of the ways of looking at things can be so different depending on who you are,
01:21:58.72 --> 01:22:04.000 that like what's the term they use, reasonable gun control. Reasonable gun control means completely
01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.24 different things to different people depending on who you are and what you're background is. So true.
01:22:08.24 --> 01:22:14.56 And so to just say, hey, we should have reasonable gun control, like I said, that means completely
01:22:14.56 --> 01:22:21.36 different things depending on who you're talking to. Yeah. So, that's why for this, for this, I just
01:22:21.36 --> 01:22:26.56 want to talk about, hey, here's something I do know about and here's pragmatic solution that will
01:22:26.56 --> 01:22:33.68 help and it should be, it should, it should be implemented. Right? That's what you have because
01:22:33.68 --> 01:22:37.44 there, there's guys and, you know, this is going to come as an surprise, but when you put into
01:22:37.44 --> 01:22:44.08 perspective, where there are people who at six years old, they got their first gun. Six. Yeah.
01:22:44.08 --> 01:22:51.12 Yeah. Then same country, same state a lot of time. Maybe even same neighborhood. There are people who
01:22:51.12 --> 01:22:56.72 have never shot a gun ever in their life and they're like 60 years old. Yeah. So, you figure someone
01:22:56.72 --> 01:23:02.72 who's never shot a gun, never handled the gun or whatever. The idea of a gun potentially can be like,
01:23:02.72 --> 01:23:10.64 that is just a death tool. That is just a object of death. So, they just don't know, you know.
01:23:10.64 --> 01:23:15.84 And then versus the guy who got their gun at six and guns are all around the house and cases
01:23:15.84 --> 01:23:20.32 and the truck and all this stuff where it's like, no, it's not a thing. A death is just a tool
01:23:20.32 --> 01:23:25.28 just like a sword hammer or something like that. Where, you know, obviously people say this all the
01:23:25.28 --> 01:23:28.64 time where it's like, hey, you know, if someone kills someone with a hammer, you don't outlaw
01:23:28.64 --> 01:23:34.40 hammers. It's like they literally feel guns are the same exact category. Seems same. But then
01:23:34.40 --> 01:23:38.80 the guy, the person who's never shot a gun, how he's going to feel is like, no, a hammer is to hit
01:23:38.80 --> 01:23:44.000 nails. If someone gets all crazy and start hitting heads with it, that's different. Guns are
01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:48.88 made to shoot people kind of a thing. That's their attitude, you know, or how they feel about it.
01:23:48.88 --> 01:23:52.88 So it's like, yeah, then, okay, now, okay, now we need laws now, right? For the guns,
01:23:52.88 --> 01:23:57.44 but these laws apply to everybody. The six year old guy or the gun is gun at six.
01:23:58.32 --> 01:24:02.40 And also the guy who's never shot a gun ever in his life, these laws have to apply to both people.
01:24:02.40 --> 01:24:06.16 So it's hard to land those laws, you know, effectively where everyone's going to like them.
01:24:06.16 --> 01:24:11.76 Yeah, it's very hard. And what makes it even hard to resist that the two sides don't talk to
01:24:11.76 --> 01:24:17.20 each other in a reasonable way to try and figure out what would be a reasonable solution.
01:24:17.20 --> 01:24:22.56 Yeah, man. So there I am using the reasonable gun laws myself. He's not done.
01:24:22.56 --> 01:24:26.40 In big, it's term. Yeah, it's true. Well, and then, yeah, because you kind of,
01:24:27.20 --> 01:24:31.84 it makes sense on a certain level, even though it's still not effective, right? Where,
01:24:31.84 --> 01:24:36.64 let's say I got a gun. My first gun at six, you know, 22 rifle,
01:24:36.64 --> 01:24:41.60 different trick and awesome. I grow up all kinds of guns, right? I have all kinds of guns
01:24:41.60 --> 01:24:45.92 of shot. My kids shoot guns, all this stuff. And then you have someone, a whole family of people who live
01:24:45.92 --> 01:24:50.32 next door or whatever, across the street. And they have never shot a gun ever in their life and
01:24:50.32 --> 01:24:55.92 their scared of them. So now they're like, hey, you know, we'll just say highly intimidated or something like that.
01:24:55.92 --> 01:25:02.64 So they come about in their, like, oh my gosh, like a gun or whatever. And then the person who's used
01:25:02.64 --> 01:25:06.64 to guns are like, how you're kind of being dumb. You're kind of being unreasonable right now.
01:25:06.64 --> 01:25:10.32 Like this gun, you have to pull the trigger shoot. You know, point out something, pull the trigger
01:25:10.32 --> 01:25:13.92 for it to shoot, whatever. It doesn't just automatically kill people, right?
01:25:13.92 --> 01:25:20.08 So the year dumb for being scared about that kind of stuff, the, it's reasonable that that would
01:25:20.08 --> 01:25:26.08 that feeling would kind of take place. You seem saying. And then you have the opposite feeling where
01:25:26.08 --> 01:25:32.24 it's like, oh, you guys are gun nuts. Like, you have like, you have 50 guns, 50. I've never shot
01:25:32.24 --> 01:25:39.52 a gun in my life. I'm scared of guns and you have 50 of them. Is it unreasonable for me to be uncomfortable?
01:25:39.52 --> 01:25:45.36 I feel like that seems pretty normal. It's what I'm saying. So I'm saying like that conflict makes
01:25:45.36 --> 01:25:50.80 sense to me. Yeah, there's just a total disconnect. Yeah, ineffective, ineffective for solving problems.
01:25:50.80 --> 01:25:54.96 But it's, you can kind of see how it happened. No, you can, you can see how the disconnect occurs.
01:25:54.96 --> 01:26:02.000 But it's a disconnect. And the problem with the disconnect occurs when you don't make any attempts
01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:10.16 to connect. And I just look at you and say, oh, you are a gun nut and you're crazy. And you know,
01:26:10.16 --> 01:26:16.48 I just, it just falls apart. And you look at me thinking, oh, you're a person that wants to take
01:26:16.48 --> 01:26:22.48 all my guns away. And so I'm just not talking to you. Yes, you're some chicken, some, you know,
01:26:22.48 --> 01:26:33.12 incapable chicken, trying to take away all, you know, my guns. Yeah, disconnect. With that,
01:26:34.40 --> 01:26:39.28 if you want to support this podcast, you can go to jockelfuel.com and get yourself some,
01:26:39.84 --> 01:26:45.60 get yourself some stuff to make yourself prepared from a physical sense. Because we got to be
01:26:45.60 --> 01:26:50.88 prepared mentally. How do you do that? You do that through good training. You got to be prepared physically.
01:26:50.88 --> 01:26:57.36 How do you do that? Do good workouts. Train you jitsu. And eat some good food. Take some good
01:26:57.36 --> 01:27:03.36 supplementation. Yeah, the training thing the more you think about it. And this might be obvious to
01:27:03.36 --> 01:27:07.28 you. But the more you think about you understand how deep training and how valuable training in
01:27:07.28 --> 01:27:12.88 every single way. Like you get someone untrained in a situation. I don't even matter the situation.
01:27:12.88 --> 01:27:19.04 I don't care if it's swimming in the pool. Okay. So if someone jumps in the pool falls in the pool,
01:27:19.04 --> 01:27:25.68 they can't swim or they can't swim very well at all. Now, it's dangerous for them. Now you get
01:27:25.68 --> 01:27:30.48 a normal person who just knows how to swim, try to go jump in their encevil. They could get dry. They
01:27:30.48 --> 01:27:38.000 could both die now. Now you get one, one person trained. Probably can save everybody. Yeah, exactly.
01:27:39.44 --> 01:27:44.88 So, Ben, you can take the most arbitrary thing, seemingly. And you train someone, you're better off.
01:27:44.88 --> 01:27:52.48 Yeah, it's weird how people, like the funny thing is to start with leadership because, you know,
01:27:52.48 --> 01:27:57.12 I teach leadership. And people think that they should already know how to lead. And so then you start
01:27:57.12 --> 01:28:01.60 breaking it down from you like, oh damn, I don't know what I'm doing. Fighting. People think they just
01:28:01.60 --> 01:28:06.08 know how to fight. Oh, punch him. When I start to see red, better look out. No, it's like, oh, you
01:28:06.08 --> 01:28:11.44 roll with someone that's, you know, a jitsu player or a real boxer. Yeah. Then you go to square off with
01:28:11.44 --> 01:28:17.68 somebody. If you've never boxed before and you square off with a boxer, you're done. You're done.
01:28:17.68 --> 01:28:20.64 You're done. You're done. You're done. You're done. You get one kick. One kick. If you don't
01:28:20.64 --> 01:28:25.68 train more time, you get kicked in the leg one time. Yeah. There's a decent chance you're done fighting.
01:28:25.68 --> 01:28:30.16 Yes, sir. Well, from a leg kick, yes, sir. There's a decent chance you call it right there. You're
01:28:30.16 --> 01:28:37.12 like, all right, this ain't happened. Yeah. So anything that you do, you, if you want to be good at
01:28:37.12 --> 01:28:44.64 something, you know, the, the thing I always use is guitar. There's no more reason that you would be
01:28:44.64 --> 01:28:49.20 able to fight or lead without training, then you would be able to play a guitar without training.
01:28:49.20 --> 01:28:55.76 Mm-hmm. It doesn't, you just can't, you can't win. You know, like, someone that played basketball
01:28:55.76 --> 01:29:00.72 will beat someone that didn't play basketball 100% of the time. Yeah, the best of all when I think
01:29:00.72 --> 01:29:05.04 is really good because when you see someone playing basketball, you'd be like, yeah, you just take
01:29:05.04 --> 01:29:10.24 that ball, you can't hold it, you got to dribble it or whatever, bounce it and you put in that hoop.
01:29:10.24 --> 01:29:14.88 Like, I know what to do. No, when you go try doing it, you're like, you can't even do it. Yeah. Again,
01:29:14.88 --> 01:29:18.08 like, if someone's trying to do it too with you or against you, whatever, you can't even do it.
01:29:18.08 --> 01:29:22.08 Yeah. So imagine getting a gun that you don't know what to do with it, but you think you know what to
01:29:22.08 --> 01:29:26.48 do with it. You know, you think you're just going to shoot or you think that there's going to be a
01:29:26.48 --> 01:29:31.44 dynamic situation and an active shooter and you think you're going to know what to do or you think
01:29:31.44 --> 01:29:35.12 people are going to be panicking and you think you're not going to be panicking. Yeah. You have to
01:29:35.12 --> 01:29:41.28 train and everything that you do. Think about, even you who's kind of trained in a lot of things,
01:29:42.08 --> 01:29:48.08 think about how many things like the normal person is trained in pretty much nothing. Yeah, not much.
01:29:48.08 --> 01:29:53.84 It's like if you have highly like, if you're highly trained in two things, you're like a jack of
01:29:53.84 --> 01:29:58.80 all trades almost kind of a thing. Think about it. But we're not trained in anything. Oh,
01:29:58.80 --> 01:30:06.56 but I am. You are. Should you have to think about like all the things to be trained in and I'm not
01:30:06.56 --> 01:30:14.16 saying expert. I'm just saying trained. You have like good usable training. What four things?
01:30:14.88 --> 01:30:17.92 Five maybe? Yeah. At the most even.
01:30:19.68 --> 01:30:24.48 I've got some good stuff to train in training. Yeah. You can get yourself some jockel fuel.

01:30:33.84 --> 01:30:38.72 On me. All right. Yes. You know, I wrote a book called Extreme Ownership. Yeah. Well,
01:30:38.72 --> 01:30:44.96 guess what? The early flavors. My fault. Well, here. This is what you did. I understand. I
01:30:44.96 --> 01:30:48.64 thought about this. This is what you did. This is all you did. It tastes good. So you know, when you're
01:30:49.36 --> 01:30:54.24 when you're young, right? Yeah. Did you ever have those, you know, like on orange juice or whatever
01:30:54.24 --> 01:31:00.40 the concentrate, you know, the one where it's like a frozen like sleeve. Yeah. Exactly. And you put it
01:31:00.40 --> 01:31:05.44 and you mix water. Right. So if you look at the dirt. Okay. So my mom, my mom, guys, would get that
01:31:05.44 --> 01:31:10.64 for us. Right. Orange juice. So it's like four to one or something. Yes. So that's what they did.
01:31:10.64 --> 01:31:16.08 They did four. They filled it up four times and put it in the pitcher. Right. The jug or whatever.
01:31:16.08 --> 01:31:21.28 So my uncle, sweet. Later on when I grew up in high school, I look at it. I look at the directions.
01:31:21.28 --> 01:31:29.28 It's three to one. Seems like they were given us the more watered down version of it. We liked it.
01:31:29.28 --> 01:31:33.12 Love it. Because that's what we were used to. Yeah. Seems like. But I tasted the three to one.
01:31:33.12 --> 01:31:35.68 I was like, probably this is a little bit too concentrated, a little bit too sweet for me.
01:31:35.68 --> 01:31:40.88 Yeah. That's what you did. Yeah. Because they're all used to water. Yeah. It was your main drink
01:31:40.88 --> 01:31:45.84 of choice. So you're like, oh, you put some monk fruit in this new energy drink. All this stuff.
01:31:45.84 --> 01:31:50.64 It seems like sweet. Sweet. Sweet. To me, you got the four to one going. Yeah. But the three to
01:31:50.64 --> 01:31:55.52 one is more our speed. I think a lot of us. It's in. Yeah. It's really like a total. It's almost like
01:31:55.52 --> 01:32:01.44 it's almost like I was like nine to one. So anyways, we got all all new flavors. All new flavors.

01:34:33.12 --> 01:34:38.72 seemingly nice guy. I don't know obviously but emailed in said hey his wife was offended by the shirt.
01:34:38.72 --> 01:34:44.000 Oh dang he needs to return it. Which one is it everyone must get stoned? No. Which one was it?

01:35:09.04 --> 01:35:13.92 Oh my be honest it was an homage to the anarchy symbol. There you go. It was straight up. It served
01:35:13.92 --> 01:35:19.12 its purpose. I'm just saying it was controversial apparently. Yeah. There you go. Okay. You get those
