00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is Jockel Podcast number 58 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now, a couple of shows ago when Dr. Peter T. was on, he mentioned an article. And I hesitate to call it an article because it is actually much more than just an article.

3
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:48.000
A elegant piece that was published in the New York Times written by his friend and the daughter of one of his mentors, a woman named Naomi Rosenberg, Dr. Naomi Rosenberg, who is a doctor at Temple University.

4
00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And Peter said that this article truly captured the emotions and the struggle and the methodology for delivering the worst news to a parent that their child had died.

5
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And I, of course, read the article and I found it incredible. And I wanted to share it with you in case you didn't have a chance to read it yourself yet.

6
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Here it is from the opinion section of the New York Times on September 3, 2016 by Dr. Naomi Rosenberg.

7
00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:04.000
How to tell a mother her child is dead? First, you get your coat. I don't care if you don't remember where you left it, you find it. If there was a lot of blood, you ask someone to go quickly to the basement to get you new set of scrubs.

8
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:22.000
You put on your coat and you go into the bathroom. You look into the mirror and you say it. You use the mother's name and you use her child's name. You may not adjust this part in any way.

9
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I will show you if it were my mother you would say Mrs. Rosenberg, I have terrible, terrible news. Naomi died today. You say it out loud until you can say it clearly and loudly. How loudly loud enough.

10
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:53.000
If it takes you fewer than five tries you are rushing it and you will not do it right. You take your time.

11
00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:06.000
After the bathroom you do nothing before you go to her. You don't make a phone call, you do not talk to the medical student, you do not put in an order. You never make her wait. She is his mother.

12
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
When you get inside the room you will know who the mother is. Yes, I am very sure.

13
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Shake her hand and tell her who you are. If there is time you shake everyone's hand. Yes, you will know if there is time.

14
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
You never stand. If there are no seats left the couches have arms on them.

15
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:39.000
You will have a decision to make. About whether you will ask her what she already knows.

16
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
If you were the one to call her and tell her that her son had been shot then you already have done part of it.

17
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:59.000
But you have not done it yet. You are about to do it now. You never make her wait. She is his mother.

18
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Now you explode the world. Yes, you have to. You say something like Mrs. Booker. I have terrible, terrible news.

19
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Ernest died today. Then you wait. You will not stand up. You may leave yourself in the heaviness of your breath or the racing of your pulse or the sight of your shoelaces on your shoe, but you will not stand up.

20
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000
You are here for her. She is his mother.

21
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
If the mother has another son with her and he has punched the wall or broken the chair do not be worried.

22
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:07.000
The one that punched the wall or broke the chair will be better than the one who looks down and refuses to cry.

23
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:22.000
The one who punched the wall or broke the chair will be much easier than the sister who looks up and closes her eyes as they fill.

24
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Security is already outside the room. When they hear the first loud noise they will know to come in.

25
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:42.000
No, you will not have to tell them. They know about the family room in the emergency department in summer in North Philadelphia.

26
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It is alright. They will be kind. If the chair cannot be sat in again, that is alright.

27
00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:05.000
We have money for new chairs every summer. If you does not break your chair, you stay in your chair. If you do, you find a new place to sit.

28
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
You are here for the mother and you have more to do.

29
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000
If she asks you, you will tell her what you know. You do not lie.

30
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:28.000
But do not say he was murdered or he was killed. Yes, I know that he was, but that is not what you say. You say that he died.

31
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
That is the part that you saw and that you know.

32
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000
When she asks, if he felt any pain, you must be very careful.

33
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:51.000
If he did not, you assure her quickly. If he did, you do not lie.

34
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
But his pain is over now.

35
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Do not ever say he was lucky that he did not feel pain.

36
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
He was not lucky. She is not lucky.

37
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Don't make that face.

38
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:27.000
The depth of the stupidity of the things you will say sometimes is unimaginable.

39
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Before you leave, you break her heart one more time.

40
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:43.000
No, I am sorry, but you cannot see him. There are strict rules when a person dies this way and the police have to take him first.

41
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:52.000
We cannot let you in. I am so sorry.

42
00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:05.000
You do not ever say the body. It is not a body. It is her son.

43
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000
You want to tell her that you know that he was hers. But she knows that.

44
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And she does not need for you to tell her.

45
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Instead, tell her you will give her time and come back in case she has questions.

46
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
More questions or questions for the first time.

47
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:39.000
If she has no questions, you do not give her the answers to the questions she has not asked.

48
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.000
You leave the room. Do not yell at the medical student who has a question.

49
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:54.000
When you get home, do not yell at your husband.

50
00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:08.000
If he left his socks on the floor again today, it is all right.

51
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And that concludes the article and it concludes the instructions from Dr. Rosenberg.

52
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And I know we are all not doctors. And even in my old job, even when men were killed, my men were killed.

53
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I did not ever have to deliver this news.

54
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I was still overseas. Still fighting.

55
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And the military has a process, a procedure to notify the next of kin when a service member

56
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:19.000
was killed and that is well documented. But I never had to do this.

57
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:34.000
But even though we are not doctors, I guess most of us are blessed in the fact that we don't have to deliver this news.

58
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:43.000
But I still think there is much to be learned.

59
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:59.000
First of all, to get some sense of what doctors and nurses and medical personnel go through on a daily basis.

60
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And the methodology that you can really back that off a little bit and think about how you can use it in situations to deliver other bad news.

61
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Rehers what you are going to say.

62
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Say it in the mirror out loud. Be direct, simply and clearly state the facts.

63
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:44.000
So there is no ambiguity. And so there is no question about what it is that you said.

64
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And then wait. You don't need to say anymore. You already said it.

65
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Don't distract from the words.

66
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Don't take away from the statement by adding to it. You said it.

67
00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Leave it alone.

68
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:17.000
You don't need to fill the silence with words. Words are good. But sometimes silence is better.

69
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Then that includes the part that Dr. Rosenberg pointed out about the way that we tend to answer questions that won't even ask.

70
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.000
No.

71
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.000
The other thing that she obviously has had to contend with is the emotions from other people.

72
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Don't let them surprise you.

73
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Expect it.

74
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
If someone wants to get angry, that's okay.

75
00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
If someone breaks down, that's okay.

76
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
No.

77
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
That it is coming.

78
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Don't let it surprise you. Don't let it catch you off guard.

79
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And she talks about body language as well. She says, don't make that face.

80
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So we have to be aware of our body language.

81
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Our body language is a language.

82
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And it communicates to people.

83
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:51.000
So make sure that the message you are communicating with your body language is the right message.

84
00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And then lastly, she talks about detachment.

85
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And the fact that even though you've gone through this horrific emotional situation,

86
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:18.000
leave it in the room, don't take out the anger and the frustration and the emotions that you do feel.

87
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Don't take them out on the intern or the medical student or your spouse or your children.

88
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Because whatever you're pretending to be mad about, doesn't matter.

89
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And what does matter is life.

90
00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
So live it.

91
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And live it well.

92
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And reading and thinking about what Dr. Rosenberg wrote, it made me think of a letter that I had read some time ago.

93
00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.000
That is sort of the reciprocal of this.

94
00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Instead of being a child that's lost, this is about a parent that's lost.

95
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Now when parents grow old and we reach old age, part of life is death.

96
00:15:50.000 --> 00:16:00.000
But there are events in the world that bring early deaths.

97
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:12.000
And I remember the letter that I had read, which was written by John Roland McGinley Burns,

98
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:22.000
who held the rank of Trooper in the two seven cavalry, commando regimen in the Australian Army.

99
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And he wrote this letter about ten months into the brutal campaign in New Guinea,

100
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:37.000
where the allies met the determined Japanese imperial troops,

101
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:47.000
who as we all know fought ruthlessly and fought to the death.

102
00:16:47.000 --> 00:17:01.000
And not only were the allies fighting against the Japanese soldiers, they also fought against the diseases of the jungle,

103
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:12.000
with nearly a hundred percent of the men suffering malaria, typos, it was a nightmare.

104
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:25.000
The bloody fever-stricken miserable nightmare.

105
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:44.000
So in that nightmare facing death, in that darkness, John Burns found the good.

106
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
He found the light.

107
00:17:50.000 --> 00:18:07.000
And here's what he had to say in a letter written to his little daughter for her second birthday.

108
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Wednesday, October 21, 1942.

109
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:24.000
The last night was a beautiful moonlit night.

110
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Every star that studied the sky, sky was sparkling like a jewel.

111
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
The air was crisp, but faintly perfume with all the fragrances,

112
00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
only a lovely spring night can devise.

113
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Today, it is raining hard. The wind is fierce and cold.

114
00:18:49.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Yes, it is miserable, something you want to pass by quickly, so that the night will again be beautiful.

115
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Life too, and it's like the weather.

116
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Some days are so lovely, the happenings of those days so enchanting, you can never forget them.

117
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Some are so unhappy, you wish they never happened, but alas they must for your life.

118
00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Your mother's mind, everyone's is so mixed up with joy and sadness that you never have one or the other for long.

119
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000
One replaces the other with a speed that is amazing.

120
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Thus it just happened two years ago.

121
00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Your mother knew and I knew that you were going to be born.

122
00:19:49.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Those days weren't anxious ones, and as the days went by, your mother used to smile at me with those lovely brown eyes, eyes that shone with courage and resolve.

123
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:12.000
If she had anxiety in her mind, she never showed it, but it must have been there.

124
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:19.000
In my heart, in mind, torments rage that no one will ever know.

125
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:29.000
But through all the doubts, all the worries, and all the long anxious hours, an end came,

126
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:36.000
bringing with it you.

127
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:45.000
From that hour, it was early in the morning, the lives of two people were filled with inexplicable happiness.

128
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:54.000
When I called to see your mother that day, I shall never forget the beauty, the happiness that shone up at me from her precious little face.

129
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Neither will I forget the pride and the joy that surge right through me when the nurse brought you along, and I held you in my arms.

130
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Soon we took you home.

131
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000
The months sped by and gradually took a hold in our hearts.

132
00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000
You laughed so much at silly things, we did to claim your attention.

133
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:32.000
You showed off to so many people, your eyes so big and questioning never failed to win admiration.

134
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
Your curly hair was indeed a special joy.

135
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:44.000
And as each month sped by you grew.

136
00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000
First you sat up, then stood up, then crawled, then walked.

137
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
As each stage passed, funny little incidents occurred.

138
00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Perhaps no one ever noticed them or remembered them, but your mother and I did.

139
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Every night when I came home for work, there were stories of your conduct through the day to be told.

140
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Some days you were good, and others you were naughty.

141
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Like for instance, the day when a little mischievous spirit seized you,

142
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
and strips of wallpaper came from the wall.

143
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Or the thoughts came crowding into my mind.

144
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Memories of days gone by when we laughed that you scolded you, and some serious times when we worried over you.

145
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
The first year of your life passed quickly.

146
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Quickly perhaps, but you grew so quickly every day, was an adventure, not only for yourself but for us.

147
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:56.000
You had a party for your first birthday, and although you sat up like Jackie, you probably will never remember it.

148
00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
But that day you got Guga for a present.

149
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Poor Guga.

150
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
As each week passed, he got dirtier and more worn.

151
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000
And the dirtier he got, the more you loved him.

152
00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Then at Christmas, Teddy came along.

153
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Dear old Teddy, so plump and with a frizzy coat.

154
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
In a few months, he was still plump, but his hair was not so frizzy.

155
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Then you'd go to sleep.

156
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Then you'd never go to sleep unless Teddy and Guga were tucked in with you.

157
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
You'll never know how and jelly, how like a cherub you looked.

158
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:50.000
When after your bath, you were popped into bed with your little playmates.

159
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Indeed, God is good.

160
00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000
How many times have your mother and I crept in to see you sleeping?

161
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
And how many times have I wiped away tears?

162
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Gentle little tears of happiness from her eyes when we came out.

163
00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
All those days were so beautiful.

164
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Like the night I sat and watched yesterday evening.

165
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
But soon came the rain.

166
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Your lovely country, so free and proud, was fighting for its life.

167
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Those indeed were dark days.

168
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.000
I had to leave your mother and you and become a soldier.

169
00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Thousands of other daddies went to because we had to fight.

170
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.000
So that all the mothers and little boys and girls could live happily.

171
00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
That was many months ago.

172
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:20.000
I do not know how long it will be before we will be home again.

173
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000
But rain, my little darling, does not last forever.

174
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Through the blackest clouds, a little piece of blue appears.

175
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
The wind blows and soon the clouds go.

176
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
So too little piece come.

177
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Then we can all be happy again.

178
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Because I am a soldier now and I cannot attend your birthday this year.

179
00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.000
You are going to have a party and I won't be there.

180
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000
But while the party is on, I'll be thinking of you and your mother.

181
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Thinking of the day you came along and of the days that have gone by since.

182
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:23.000
You are lovely now like your mother.

183
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Some day when you grow up, some man is going to be lost in your loveliness.

184
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Like I was when I fell in love with your mother.

185
00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
But no matter, we cannot have you forever.

186
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:48.000
While we do, we will teach you all the lovely things in life.

187
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
And there are so many beautiful things in life.

188
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
There are two bad things.

189
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
And these also we will tell you about.

190
00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:08.000
So that you will know how to pass them by.

191
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Maybe it will be years before you will be able to read this letter.

192
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:21.000
But when you can, you will know at least how much we love you and how much you mean to us.

193
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
I am looking forward to seeing you soon.

194
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.000
And to seeing those big brown eyes of yours laugh back at me.

195
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Until then, my little girl.

196
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Goodbye.

197
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
And God bless you on your birthday.

198
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.000
From your adoring, data.

199
00:27:49.000 --> 00:28:01.000
And data.

200
00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Soldier.

201
00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Trooper.

202
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Father.

203
00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
John Burns died in New Guinea.

204
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
On the 9th of February 1943.

205
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000
A few months after that letter was written.

206
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:52.000
And when I say that war, that war brings out the worst in people.

207
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
But that it also brings out the best in people.

208
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:05.000
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

209
00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:20.000
What force moved the hand of John Burns.

210
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:28.000
It was absolutely the love of his daughter.

211
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
But was that expression?

212
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Only revealed in so pure form because of the evil that he faced.

213
00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:49.000
The peril that he faced, the horror that he faced.

214
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:57.000
I think war brings out the worst in people.

215
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
But also brings out the best in people.

216
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
And I'm sorry for that.

217
00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:14.000
I don't want it to be that way.

218
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:33.000
So I would ask you and I ask myself, can we free our minds?

219
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Can we access that purity?

220
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:47.000
We can't we access that purity without the horror.

221
00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Without the imminent fear of death.

222
00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Without evil.

223
00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Can we access and can we recognize that purity?

224
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Without war.

225
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:28.000
I do not know the answer.

226
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
But I hope.

227
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000
I hope that by looking at the horror.

228
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:47.000
By looking at the hatred and the savagery and the utter lack of humanity that war unleashes.

229
00:31:47.000 --> 00:32:02.000
I hope that that allows us to take one step closer.

230
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:13.000
One step closer to the purity and the beauty and the love.

231
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:29.000
The love that John Burns was able to find and express to his young daughter as he marched forward into the wretched jungle toward evil.

232
00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Towards war.

233
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:45.000
And toward death.

234
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Let us hope.

235
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Let us remember.

236
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Let us learn.

237
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Let us learn about the darkness.

238
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:15.000
So that our mind can see with the greatest of contrast.

239
00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
The light.

240
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
And good.

241
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
So that.

242
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:36.000
So that we can proclaim the pure agiration and the pure love.

243
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.000
That be fits the divine.

244
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
The divine.

245
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:57.000
And beautiful and real living angels.

246
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Like Anne.

247
00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:10.000
That's around us every day.

248
00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Because they are here.

249
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:25.000
The angels are here.

250
00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:50.000
With us.

251
00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Kind of a rough way to open things up I know.

252
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:10.000
And that's one letter from one time period in the world.

253
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
And I have no idea.

254
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:30.000
I can't even comprehend how many millions of those letters were written.

255
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:46.000
And I would say if you're not facing death, then you're not facing horror.

256
00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Still.

257
00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:03.000
And that letter.

258
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Michael Charles.

259
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:22.000
I feel like I'm listening.

260
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
I kind of gave echo ahead of this was going to be kind of harsh.

261
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
I remember when I read that letter for the first time.

262
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
But I remember just reading it thinking.

263
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:44.000
And the other thing is echo with his young daughter.

264
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:52.000
And you see, he's told me this before about like when a trossier is taking place and he's all okay.

265
00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
You know, soldiers are getting killed and he doesn't get that emotional about it.

266
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000
But anytime I start talking about kids getting hurt echo, he says hard time.

267
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
So he's got a beautiful young daughter and a son.

268
00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Who, what do you call a son?

269
00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
What do you call him handsome?

270
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:11.000
He's too small.

271
00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Be handsome.

272
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
You can't call him beautiful because he's a boy.

273
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
He's very handsome.

274
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Okay, we call him handsome.

275
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
I think he's very handsome.

276
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.000
So.

277
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
That like I said, I gave echo the heads up.

278
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
I said it was going to be harsh.

279
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
And obviously it was pretty harsh.

280
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Yeah, I think you can't help but I mean all of this stuff like you just put yourself in the situation.

281
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Yeah.

282
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
I told you about the time I was watching Hawaii 50.

283
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
The new one.

284
00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Not the older one.

285
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
The new one.

286
00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
And it just happens to be when it's in Hawaii and all this stuff.

287
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
So it's good show.

288
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
I think it's a good show.

289
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
But it's not like heavier deep.

290
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
It's a fun action show.

291
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Doesn't it like Baywatch kind of?

292
00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Well, maybe.

293
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
But nonetheless, it's, you know, it's a Hawaii Bible crying.

294
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
They got us all the crime.

295
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
So one of them is pretty recent like few weeks ago, whatever.

296
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000
There's a prom.

297
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
And one of the five old guys son is at the prom.

298
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Terrorist take over the prom to do something, right?

299
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Now the little conundrum is task units.

300
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Guys son is in the prom, but they got us to go solve the crime too, you know?

301
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
But the sun's in there.

302
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
So it adds this little thing.

303
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:38.000
And then it was one of those things.

304
00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.000
We're kind of like on the movie die hard with it.

305
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
When the terrorism thing got sprung on them, the sun was in like the bathroom or something.

306
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
So he has to kind of work along with another guy was there.

307
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Nope, from five old to Shaperone.

308
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000
They were in the bathroom.

309
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
So they had to go behind the scenes.

310
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
So it was like.

311
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000
Anyway.

312
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
At the end of the day, the sun's kind of like the hero, you know?

313
00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
And then he like, come on.

314
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
You can't let it away.

315
00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.000
You can't let it away.

316
00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Five old bed.

317
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
You down like this bro.

318
00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.000
I know man.

319
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Did.

320
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Did.

321
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Uh.

322
00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Good.

323
00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
I'm not laughing at you.

324
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
I'm laughing with you.

325
00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
It's not going to find my way.

326
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Yes.

327
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000
I know.

328
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
I know man.

329
00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
This is harsh.

330
00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000
It's brutal.

331
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.000
It's brutal.

332
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
And you know, just so.

333
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:38.000
You know, kind of the pre recording conversation that we had is what I was saying to you is.

334
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Hey, man, I'm going to like a lot of times on the podcast.

335
00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000
I kind of time to prepare for it.

336
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000
So I can answer the questions because I can think about them and all this.

337
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000
And I said, I'm going to ask a question.

338
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000
I don't have the answer to right.

339
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
And I'm sure we'll get a lot of feedback on this as far as.

340
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:08.000
You know, does this intense, you know, war scenario make you express yourself more fully.

341
00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
And basically, I asked Echo before before we started recording.

342
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
You know, we were having that conversation.

343
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
And I said, if you were going to come here, if I was going to kill you right now.

344
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
What would you say to your daughter?

345
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
What would you, if I gave you the phone said you can talk to her one more time?

346
00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
What would you have you said that to her today?

347
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Have you said it two in this week?

348
00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
And I don't know.

349
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
I don't know if we do that.

350
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
I don't think we do.

351
00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
I don't think we normally do because you, I mean, you're not going to go through life like that.

352
00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Then I'm not saying you need to do it every day.

353
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:48.000
But how you open up to that purity that you get when you're.

354
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:57.000
When your life is at risk and you're in the jungles of New Guinea and people are dying all around you.

355
00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
And you know what your daughter's birthday coming up and you want to write her a letter.

356
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
And you know it might be the last thing she ever sees from you.

357
00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
There's some.

358
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:17.000
I believe that there's some force that that moves through you and and moves your hand and moves your mind and moves your heart.

359
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Which if you think about it, why?

360
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Like there's a lot of subjects to have books about or to have movies about why there's so many warm movies.

361
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Or what's that all about?

362
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
There's warm movies, you know, there's warm movies upon warm movies.

363
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:39.000
There's no, there's no other, is there another subject that there's as many movies about than war?

364
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Right? There's not.

365
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Is there?

366
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000
I don't know.

367
00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000
There's a lot.

368
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:49.000
I mean, I guess you could say in general on a broad category could be like romance, but even romance movies.

369
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
There's, you know.

370
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
I mean, those are marginal at best.

371
00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
I don't think you know anything about the quantity of romance movies anyway.

372
00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
So really no, no guessing.

373
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
But we know that there's, to say the least, there's a lot of warm movies.

374
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
I guess there's a lot of cops and robbers movies.

375
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
But guess what?

376
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.000
That's the same thing.

377
00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Yeah, you got, you know, they're going to make cops and robber movies about giving out tickets for parking.

378
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
They do cop and robber movies about cops and robbers killing each other and being bad guys and all that.

379
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Risk and the family is the family and all that.

380
00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
And even, okay, here's another big genre of movies.

381
00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Mobster movies, right?

382
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Mobster movies, a lot of mobster movies.

383
00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Well, it's not, it's not, it's always about the life and death scenarios.

384
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
That's what it's about.

385
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
So I believe there is something to that.

386
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000
I don't know what it is.

387
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
But there's something that opens up your mind.

388
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:54.000
And again, I think that's why it's important to look at these things and feel these things as much as you can feel them.

389
00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:06.000
So that you can have some more access in your brain to get to that part of your mind and your heart to express what's in there.

390
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
That isn't going to come out unless it's put under that kind of pressure.

391
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Yeah.

392
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Either that or maybe Hawaii, five oh dozen.

393
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
You never know that.

394
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Well, time with my wife was pregnant with her first, our first kid.

395
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000
And, you know, the hormones get all crazy.

396
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
She's your progesterone.

397
00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Yeah.

398
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.000
And so we're watching something on TV back in the day and an AT&T commercial came on.

399
00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Yeah.

400
00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000
And it was, you know, the dad was not home or something like that.

401
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
And I hear like sniffling and I look over.

402
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
There's a 30 second commercial.

403
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
You know, 14 seconds into it.

404
00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
She's ball like that.

405
00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Yeah.

406
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
What is wrong with this?

407
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000
She's just so sad.

408
00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000
I'm good.

409
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Okay.

410
00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000
He never know.

411
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000
I think he's come out of nowhere.

412
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Watch like Armageddon.

413
00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
I don't know if you ever seen that one bill.

414
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Oh, oh.

415
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Just just FYI.

416
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000
I haven't seen any cheesy stupid movies or things blowing up everywhere.

417
00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Bruce Willis.

418
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
Those aren't the emotional news that I'm looking for.

419
00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Yeah.

420
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Well, at the end Bruce Willis, same deal.

421
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
But how's this though?

422
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
He's talking to her through a camera.

423
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
And as he, you know, it's the same deal as this letter though.

424
00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000
He's saying, not that long and in depth.

425
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Yeah.

426
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
That's not, you know, that is deep.

427
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Of course.

428
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000
But still same scenario because he, he has to detonate the bomb.

429
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
But the remote detonator broke.

430
00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Yeah.

431
00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
So he has to do it manually and blow himself up.

432
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Just save the world.

433
00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
I mean, well, you got to tell this daughter.

434
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Anyway, same deal, man.

435
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
You know, with this, the other thing that I, that I find interesting about this thought,

436
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:47.000
right about this thought of accessing this place, this kind of emotional place that people

437
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
get into.

438
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:54.000
And I think sometimes what happens is guys get in there.

439
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Yeah.

440
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
And they can't get back out.

441
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Or just, I, like, that's almost a description of combat trauma or when somebody comes back,

442
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000
oh, they're so emotional.

443
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Yeah.

444
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
It's because they're in that spot and they can't get out.

445
00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Oh, yeah.

446
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
They can't put it back in check.

447
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
They can't get control of it again.

448
00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
And so I think that might be another thing for for people that are visualizing this and visualizing

449
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
and when I'm saying you want to get to that place,

450
00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
you also want to be able to get back out of it.

451
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Yeah.

452
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000
You know, you don't want to get wrapped around and live in this super hyper emotional world.

453
00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
And it's, it's not even emotional.

454
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:40.000
It's a purity of thought and crystalline love.

455
00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.000
And if you get stuck in there, all of a sudden, you can't function normally.

456
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Yeah.

457
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
And so you got to, it's good to dip into it.

458
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000
It's good to see it.

459
00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
It's good to feel it.

460
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
But then you got to be able to get back out of it.

461
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
And if you get stuck in there, you know, that's what happens when guys come home from

462
00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
multiple combat deployments.

463
00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000
They're just in there.

464
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.000
And it comes and goes and they, they, it's like, it's damaged or something damaged, but it's just an open

465
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
access and an open wound.

466
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Yeah.

467
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.000
And so you got to learn to kind of get that under control as well.

468
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Because that's where I think that's where I think problems come in.

469
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
If you spend all your time in that area,

470
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000
you're not, you're, you're off balance.

471
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Yeah.

472
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
You got to, you got to somehow balance it.

473
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Yeah, man.

474
00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
So,

475
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
it, and this is the funny thing, just because we're here, right?

476
00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
I'm gonna talk about it.

477
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000
This, like, what, what you're going through right now, like, kind of a mood swing scenario.

478
00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.000
What I was going through, what you were going through,

479
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
what, what, what, when, I remember like when, when,

480
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
all, me, Grisard died, right?

481
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
He was, he got his, my, tune.

482
00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
And I talked about it when we were on the Tim Ferriss podcast.

483
00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
When Tim Ferriss came on our podcast.

484
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Yeah.

485
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000
And I talked about, Gris was his nickname.

486
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
He was killed in a murder suicide.

487
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000
It was horrible.

488
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:15.000
But that was the first time, like, we'd, we'd, we'd, we'd, with my teammates.

489
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
And we'd be all, like, super emotional and sad, and then we'd be laughing.

490
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Thirty seconds later.

491
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Yeah.

492
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
And then crying again another thirty seconds later.

493
00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000
And then laughing a minute later.

494
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Yeah.

495
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
And, and we'd be laughing at each other for crying.

496
00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Yeah.

497
00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000
And then, yeah.

498
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000
And then crying because we were laughing, it's just, it's normal.

499
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
I believe it's normal, because I saw that with every, you know,

500
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
every death that I've experienced in the sealed teams, you know, guys.

501
00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000
It's, it's, it's not like you have to be sad now.

502
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
And you have to be sad for 14 days or nine days.

503
00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000
There's no, no, it's not like that.

504
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
You know how long you have to be sad for?

505
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Until you feel just, just like John Burn talked about in this thing.

506
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000
The sadness and the happiness comes so quickly.

507
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Yeah.

508
00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
And that's what happens when you get, you when you go through rough patches.

509
00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Or when bad things happen.

510
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Those, those emotions will come and it's, and I just want people to know it's normal.

511
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
It's normal to, to be crying one minute.

512
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
And then laughing 30 seconds later.

513
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Yeah.

514
00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
And that's normal and it's okay because I've seen it with every death of experience.

515
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
And I mean, I know that the sealed teams is kind of, you know,

516
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000
we're a little different, but I saw it with the families.

517
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000
I saw it with, you know, people that weren't in the sealed teams with us.

518
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000
I saw the same reactions.

519
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Yeah.

520
00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000
So it's normal.

521
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
And that's even you, ten minutes ago, you were like crying and you heard me laughing.

522
00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000
You started laughing.

523
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
You started laughing. You started laughing.

524
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
And then as soon as you kind of got a laughter out and then all of a sudden you went right back,

525
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000
you were vacillating back between the two.

526
00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
And that's like I said, it's normal.

527
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000
It's okay.

528
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000
It's what happens when you start getting emotional about stuff.

529
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Yeah.

530
00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Thankfully, my situation's more thinking about it.

531
00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000
You know, it's like I'm thinking about something bad that clear.

532
00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:05.000
Yeah.

533
00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000
But like, but it was the same way.

534
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
If you know if something terrible did happen, you're going to feel the same way.

535
00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000
And it's, you know, everyone should be just expecting that.

536
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Yeah.

537
00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
And it's probably the way that we deal with it emotionally.

538
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Yeah.

539
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Man, one, my daughter had to like, like, she was, she was two.

540
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000
I think almost two.

541
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
She got a staff, merciless staff infection in her lymph node.

542
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Oh, god.

543
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
So it's like, and so, you know, we're there in the hospital for like a week, maybe two.

544
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000
And there was, yeah, same deal, man, where it's like,

545
00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
because she's cool with it.

546
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
You know, it doesn't really hurt or nothing.

547
00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000
It's just this thing.

548
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
And then you're like, man, it's just this weird roller coaster.

549
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Like how you're saying.

550
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Crazy.

551
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Hey, that's part of the game, like yeah.

552
00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000
So let's go to some Q&A from the interwebs.

553
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.000
Sure.

554
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
Question number one.

555
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Something a little bit more positive.

556
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000
More like a little bit more positive.

557
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Yeah.

558
00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000
And this question is actually very positive.

559
00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000
I like this question.

560
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000
All right.

561
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000
So let's rock and roll.

562
00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Here it is from the interwebs.

563
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
I am not Shakespeare.

564
00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.52
So I cannot come up with a Facebook message that we'll express how powerful of an impact

565
00:50:12.52 --> 00:50:14.40
you and Echo have had on my life.

566
00:50:14.40 --> 00:50:16.000
My father died when I was 10.

567
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000
And I spent the next 12 years wasting my physical and mental gifts.

568
00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.80
You've taught me many of the lessons that I like to believe my father would have taught

569
00:50:25.80 --> 00:50:29.000
me if you were alive.

570
00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.40
Here's a brief list of my achievements over the past two years that you deserve at least

571
00:50:34.40 --> 00:50:36.40
partial credit to.

572
00:50:36.40 --> 00:50:37.40
Here we go.

573
00:50:37.40 --> 00:50:39.000
Lost 90 pounds.

574
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Net weight 300 from 300 pounds down to 210.

575
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000
That's legit.

576
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000
That's a big difference.

577
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Yeah.

578
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
People weigh 90 pounds by the way.

579
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Yes, a whole person.

580
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Yeah.

581
00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000
Deadlift Max went from 225 to 455.

582
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Legit.

583
00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Bench went from 185 to 315.

584
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Excellent.

585
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Yeah.

586
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Started training.

587
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Boom.

588
00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Boom.

589
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Yeah.

590
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.000
And boxing with friends even though there's nowhere to train where I currently live

591
00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
except for the yoga room at LA Fitness.

592
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000
You can make it happen in the yoga room at LA Fitness.

593
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Let's get it on in the yoga room at LA Fitness.

594
00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000
That's how I'm talking about.

595
00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000
Like on line heart, I think they did it in the yoga.

596
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Anyway.

597
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
That's a whole other thing.

598
00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Anyway, spent two years working at an awful job where I led from the middle and improved

599
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:39.000
the output of the entire facility while adding to my own skill set to the point where I was able to get a job.

600
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Get a job.

601
00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.000
I love that's awesome.

602
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:49.000
That that's awesome to be bragging about the fact that you had an awful job that you just got after it.

603
00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000
And look what happened.

604
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Guess what the results are.

605
00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
You get the job that you want.

606
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000
The job you love.

607
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Started at the new job last Wednesday.

608
00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000
So that just happened.

609
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000
Boom.

610
00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Legit.

611
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000
So and see, started taking class for the next job.

612
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
I want on a course era.

613
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Must be some kind of an internet thing.

614
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
I'm halfway through the data science certification program.

615
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Yeah, data science.

616
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.000
I'm currently 26 and I fully intend to get after it until the day I die.

617
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:22.000
I passed your lessons on to my younger brother who has lost 50 pounds and swings a kettlebell.

618
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000
I got him every day.

619
00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:33.000
When I lacked the motivation to do what needs to be done, your words ring aloud in my ears discipline equals freedom.

620
00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Thank you so much.

621
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Okay, so my question is.

622
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:43.000
You may not reason I included this preamble of kind of what he's been you're going to hear.

623
00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
But as I thought about how to answer this question,

624
00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.000
it's good to know what the background is and what successes he's had.

625
00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000
That's what we kind of threw that in there.

626
00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Because it's an antrodome.

627
00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
It's awesome to hear about a trooper just getting after it.

628
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Yeah, thank numbers too.

629
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000
That's the thing.

630
00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Yeah.

631
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000
That's the good thing about like, you know, you can say I'm getting after it nowadays.

632
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Good.

633
00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
But now I'm dead lifting four fifty times.

634
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Yeah, this guy is like getting after it.

635
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000
Here's how.

636
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Here's how.

637
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Maybe he's all.

638
00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.000
Okay.

639
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Jock, you may not have this issue.

640
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:19.000
How do you avoid feeling discouraged when you realize how much of your life you wasted when you're not getting.

641
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
When you're not getting after it.

642
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Do you ever worry that you won't achieve your full potential because you wasted time?

643
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Well, first of all, like I said, first and foremost, congratulations.

644
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Second.

645
00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
That's just legit.

646
00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.000
And to have made that much progress, you're obviously on the path and getting after it and what you've accomplished is awesome.

647
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Some people never make that transition.

648
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000
So stay on it.

649
00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Keep crushing it.

650
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Now, as far as discouragement goes from not having gotten on the path earlier, and do I feel that way when I feel that way?

651
00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Negative.

652
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Don't know.

653
00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Okay.

654
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
You were a little late getting in the game.

655
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
But I'll tell you what, twenty six years old.

656
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Is that what we're talking about?

657
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000
Twenty six.

658
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:05.000
Yeah.

659
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000
At twenty six years old, you're young and you're young and a butt.

660
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000
I'll tell you what.

661
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Even if even if you were forty or fifty or sixty or seventy doesn't matter.

662
00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000
You're in the game now and that's what counts.

663
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.000
And all those quote unquote wasted years, they, they weren't wasted.

664
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000
Right?

665
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.000
They're not wasted because you learned.

666
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
And specifically, what did he learn about?

667
00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Learned about what it's like to be out of shape.

668
00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Learned about what it's like to be overweight.

669
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Learned about what it's like to be weak.

670
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.000
And the knowledge that you learned about those things is,

671
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:50.000
is fuel to make sure that it never happens again.

672
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Because you know, you know what is out there.

673
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.000
And you know how bad it can get.

674
00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:04.000
And this is the other reason why it's beneficial that you,

675
00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.000
you have a past that wasn't perfect is now.

676
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.000
You can teach other people how to do it.

677
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Very clearly.

678
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000
You can inspire other people to do a look at what you did.

679
00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.000
What you did to your brother.

680
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000
You know, right?

681
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
It's another good example that so back in the day before anybody knew what

682
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000
GJ2 was.

683
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
Back in the day.

684
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.000
I am the worst person to introduce GJ2 to people.

685
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Because when they see me because I'm 225 pounds and I'm, you know, a big guy.

686
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
And they think of course this guy can choke me.

687
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Of course, you know, they, they don't expect anything else.

688
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000
So when I choke them they're like, well, yeah, you're really strong.

689
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Yeah.

690
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:49.000
So the best people to introduce GJ2 to people is like Jeff Glover.

691
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Right?

692
00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000
Who's 150 pounds?

693
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Skinny guy.

694
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.000
And he comes out and choke.

695
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000
Do you big strong guy?

696
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.000
27 times in a row.

697
00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
They say, oh, maybe this stuff works.

698
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Yeah.

699
00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Well, it's the same thing here.

700
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.000
People look at me.

701
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:02.000
They go, jok.

702
00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
You know, jok was just hardcore.

703
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000
No.

704
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Not just me.

705
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Look at you.

706
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000
You're the one that did it.

707
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
You went through a much bigger transition than I've ever gone through

708
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.000
in my life.

709
00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Yeah.

710
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:20.000
So I say you embrace what you learned from the weekdays.

711
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Let them let them make you even stronger.

712
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:31.000
And you use your own personal transformation that you've made in life.

713
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Use that to help other people transform and get on the path as well.

714
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000
That's one of that.

715
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000
So good.

716
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
And there's a lot to be said to for that.

717
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.000
Like how he was talking.

718
00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.000
What I think is.

719
00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
How his brother lost 50 pounds.

720
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Right?

721
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000
And that's like a lot.

722
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Like a lot of times, I feel like when people do good stuff for themselves,

723
00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000
and make these big changes.

724
00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Other people who see, there's kind of, there's 2PM,

725
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000
I'm sure there's one, 2, but there's 2 kind of people where someone will be like,

726
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.000
I'll just hate.

727
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
And they'll be just jealous and they won't, you know, whatever.

728
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.000
But the legit people like in your life are around you are going to be like, hey, what

729
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000
do you do?

730
00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Even if like, even if it's not losing it, even if it's like you're making millions of

731
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000
dollars now.

732
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000
They're like, like, what are you doing?

733
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.000
You know, you just sort of change real quick.

734
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Like you're now you're making millions of dollars.

735
00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:24.000
What do you do?

736
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000
I want to do.

737
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.000
I want to get on that stuff, whatever you're doing.

738
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000
And the workout thing, that's a big one.

739
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.000
So if like a lot of times like girls, the lose all this weight and now they're like

740
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.96
super attractive as they always wanted to be kind of

741
00:57:35.96 --> 00:57:37.96
like a thing, all the other thing is, what did you do?

742
00:57:37.96 --> 00:57:38.96
Oh my gosh, what did you do?

743
00:57:38.96 --> 00:57:40.96
And they want to do it too.

744
00:57:40.96 --> 00:57:45.96
It's like, it's almost like, almost like you can prove to other people.

745
00:57:45.96 --> 00:57:46.96
You're walking beef.

746
00:57:46.96 --> 00:57:47.96
Yeah, exactly.

747
00:57:47.96 --> 00:57:48.96
It's good.

748
00:57:48.96 --> 00:57:49.96
Yeah.

749
00:57:49.96 --> 00:57:50.96
Stay on the path man.

750
00:57:50.96 --> 00:57:51.96
That's awesome.

751
00:57:51.96 --> 00:57:53.96
Awesome stuff.

752
00:57:53.96 --> 00:57:54.96
Next.

753
00:57:54.96 --> 00:57:56.96
Jockel.

754
00:57:56.96 --> 00:58:04.96
How do you handle, how do you handle employee morale after terminating a popular supervisor

755
00:58:04.96 --> 00:58:05.96
for cause?

756
00:58:05.96 --> 00:58:06.96
Okay.

757
00:58:06.96 --> 00:58:12.96
So I mean, it's kind of a rough one, but it's not something that doesn't happen.

758
00:58:12.96 --> 00:58:17.96
It doesn't happen all the time because a lot of times people that are popular, they do well,

759
00:58:17.96 --> 00:58:19.96
but sometimes people are popular for a long reason.

760
00:58:19.96 --> 00:58:20.96
They're popular because they let people cut corners.

761
00:58:20.96 --> 00:58:22.96
They're popular because they slack what?

762
00:58:22.96 --> 00:58:24.96
Um, what is it for cause?

763
00:58:24.96 --> 00:58:28.96
Just, meaning they, they weren't efficient in their job.

764
00:58:28.96 --> 00:58:30.96
It's, it's you, you failed.

765
00:58:30.96 --> 00:58:31.96
Okay.

766
00:58:31.96 --> 00:58:32.96
Basically, you're not up to par.

767
00:58:32.96 --> 00:58:33.96
Okay.

768
00:58:33.96 --> 00:58:39.96
And so people sometimes popular people pop their supervisors.

769
00:58:39.96 --> 00:58:42.96
Yeah, like I said, sometimes they're they're popular because they do great.

770
00:58:42.96 --> 00:58:46.96
Great leaders, but a lot of times they're popular because they let people get away with

771
00:58:46.96 --> 00:58:47.96
Mercer.

772
00:58:47.96 --> 00:58:48.96
Yeah.

773
00:58:48.96 --> 00:58:53.96
And so when you figure that out, that the person's not doing their job and not a good leader, then you

774
00:58:53.96 --> 00:58:54.96
got to fire them.

775
00:58:54.96 --> 00:58:56.96
I mean, you've tried to cancel them all that stuff, but now you got to fire them.

776
00:58:56.96 --> 00:58:58.96
So how are you going to get through that?

777
00:58:58.96 --> 00:59:01.96
Well, for one thing.

778
00:59:01.96 --> 00:59:04.96
The number one thing you got to do is explain why T to the people to the troops.

779
00:59:04.96 --> 00:59:11.96
You got to explain why this person is being removed and just, you know, just like we just kind of learned from

780
00:59:11.96 --> 00:59:22.96
the opening piece about being direct and not avoiding the conversation, have the conversation, be straightforward.

781
00:59:22.96 --> 00:59:24.96
And now, now this is a key piece.

782
00:59:24.96 --> 00:59:29.96
Don't be disparaging of the person that's getting fired, right?

783
00:59:29.96 --> 00:59:35.96
That guy was a dirt bag on you know, you because these people are, you know, some of them have relationship with them.

784
00:59:35.96 --> 00:59:39.96
And so you don't want to just immediately create animosity, but you do have to be straightforward.

785
00:59:39.96 --> 00:59:41.96
You do have to say, look, we had standards here.

786
00:59:41.96 --> 00:59:44.96
He was out of bounds on these things right here and we just can't do that in this company.

787
00:59:44.96 --> 00:59:46.96
We got to hold the line.

788
00:59:46.96 --> 00:59:48.96
You know, there's ethical reasons.

789
00:59:48.96 --> 00:59:51.96
There's legal reasons or whatever the case may be.

790
00:59:51.96 --> 00:59:52.96
So that's that.

791
00:59:52.96 --> 00:59:55.96
The other thing is you got to inspire some conversation.

792
00:59:55.96 --> 00:59:56.96
You got to inspire some questions.

793
00:59:56.96 --> 01:00:01.96
So they're, so that they can, because you're trying to close the gap with a relationship, right?

794
01:00:01.96 --> 01:00:05.96
You fired somebody and now there's a gap, a relationship gap.

795
01:00:05.96 --> 01:00:13.96
Because that person that you fired is the relationship between, they connect the relationship between this, his subordinates and you.

796
01:00:13.96 --> 01:00:15.96
So now there's a gap in the relationship.

797
01:00:15.96 --> 01:00:18.96
So you got to fill that gap.

798
01:00:18.96 --> 01:00:23.96
So you've got to start getting the conversations going, talking to them, getting them,

799
01:00:23.96 --> 01:00:26.96
just like I said, closing the gap in the relationship.

800
01:00:26.96 --> 01:00:31.96
The other thing is you got to explain what the follow-on plan is very clearly.

801
01:00:31.96 --> 01:00:34.96
And you got to introduce whoever's taking their place.

802
01:00:34.96 --> 01:00:36.96
You got to introduce them.

803
01:00:36.96 --> 01:00:38.96
I mean, immediately they got to be ready to rock and roll.

804
01:00:38.96 --> 01:00:42.96
They got to be ready and they, you have to count to them on like, hey, you're, you know what I'm putting you in here?

805
01:00:42.96 --> 01:00:44.96
Be a leader. Yes, run this job site.

806
01:00:44.96 --> 01:00:47.96
Yes, I need you to build these relationships with these guys.

807
01:00:47.96 --> 01:00:49.96
You're now taking over relationship.

808
01:00:49.96 --> 01:00:50.96
You're taking over boss.

809
01:00:50.96 --> 01:00:52.96
Yes, but you're taking over the relationships that he had.

810
01:00:52.96 --> 01:00:54.96
Now here's what you got to do to do it.

811
01:00:54.96 --> 01:00:55.96
You got to go and you got to be humble.

812
01:00:55.96 --> 01:00:56.96
You got to ask questions.

813
01:00:56.96 --> 01:00:58.96
You're all the standard leadership stuff.

814
01:00:58.96 --> 01:01:01.96
But you got to get them focused in the right area.

815
01:01:01.96 --> 01:01:04.96
You also got to, you also got to make sure who's ever coming in and take their place.

816
01:01:04.96 --> 01:01:09.96
Make sure that they understand what the political terrain is, which guys were boys,

817
01:01:09.96 --> 01:01:11.96
with the guy you fired, which guys didn't like them anyway.

818
01:01:11.96 --> 01:01:13.96
So you got to explain all that to him.

819
01:01:13.96 --> 01:01:15.96
So they understand what's going on.

820
01:01:15.96 --> 01:01:17.96
And the last thing I'll say on this is,

821
01:01:17.96 --> 01:01:27.96
you'll find that oftentimes somebody that you think is mission critical,

822
01:01:27.96 --> 01:01:29.96
they're actually not mission critical.

823
01:01:29.96 --> 01:01:32.96
They're not as mission critical as they think they are.

824
01:01:32.96 --> 01:01:35.96
And they're not as mission critical as you think they are.

825
01:01:35.96 --> 01:01:41.96
And others, when someone is doing a bad job or someone is not a good leader,

826
01:01:41.96 --> 01:01:44.96
the other people, even though there might be buddy buddy with them,

827
01:01:44.96 --> 01:01:48.96
they know it and they know they should be removed.

828
01:01:48.96 --> 01:01:52.96
And when you do it, a lot of times the respect level goes up.

829
01:01:52.96 --> 01:01:56.96
So that means the other people that are in that position will,

830
01:01:56.96 --> 01:02:00.96
or the support, it's a lot of them are ready to step up too.

831
01:02:00.96 --> 01:02:03.96
They're ready, they think it's going to take you forever to fire this guy.

832
01:02:03.96 --> 01:02:06.96
I mean, we were doing what we got to do and he's popular and everything.

833
01:02:06.96 --> 01:02:09.96
He's nice, but we see where it's coming from.

834
01:02:09.96 --> 01:02:12.96
So have confidence when you do it, you know,

835
01:02:12.96 --> 01:02:15.96
be be, be thoughtful.

836
01:02:15.96 --> 01:02:18.96
But when you make the decision and you know it's the right thing to do,

837
01:02:18.96 --> 01:02:21.96
do it, get that other leader ready to rock and roll,

838
01:02:21.96 --> 01:02:24.96
explain everything very clearly, explain why you're doing it,

839
01:02:24.96 --> 01:02:29.96
and build, fill that gap in relationships that now it's going to exist.

840
01:02:29.96 --> 01:02:32.96
When you say mission critical, what does that mean?

841
01:02:32.96 --> 01:02:35.96
Meaning without this guy,

842
01:02:35.96 --> 01:02:37.96
the mission is going to fail.

843
01:02:37.96 --> 01:02:38.96
Yeah.

844
01:02:38.96 --> 01:02:40.96
If Echo wasn't here for the podcast, we wouldn't be able to do it.

845
01:02:40.96 --> 01:02:42.96
Yeah, so like I know actually we would.

846
01:02:42.96 --> 01:02:44.96
No, I'm trying some other guy.

847
01:02:44.96 --> 01:02:48.96
I'd be like, hey, can you press record on this machine over here?

848
01:02:48.96 --> 01:02:51.96
And someone would say, yeah, it's a cool.

849
01:02:51.96 --> 01:02:53.96
And then I'd say, do it.

850
01:02:53.96 --> 01:02:55.96
And I'd say, well, do you know how to make YouTube videos?

851
01:02:55.96 --> 01:02:57.96
Because that would be an addition.

852
01:02:57.96 --> 01:02:59.96
Since Echo doesn't do much of that,

853
01:02:59.96 --> 01:03:01.96
you maybe you could help with that.

854
01:03:01.96 --> 01:03:03.96
No, the mission critical just means a guy that,

855
01:03:03.96 --> 01:03:08.96
and this happens is, you see the technology companies where you got some guy that's really in the code.

856
01:03:08.96 --> 01:03:09.96
Yeah.

857
01:03:09.96 --> 01:03:10.96
And then anybody else?

858
01:03:10.96 --> 01:03:13.96
And so if I leave, no one's going to understand what I built.

859
01:03:13.96 --> 01:03:16.96
Well, first of all, you did a bad job if no one's going to understand what you built.

860
01:03:16.96 --> 01:03:20.96
But, but yeah, I need to even have to succeed with construction.

861
01:03:20.96 --> 01:03:22.96
When a building, if you're building something more complex,

862
01:03:22.96 --> 01:03:26.96
like all of a sudden, you have one guy that really understands the details.

863
01:03:26.96 --> 01:03:29.96
And it can be hard because everyone thinks,

864
01:03:29.96 --> 01:03:32.96
if we lose him, he's the only guy that knows how to do XYZ.

865
01:03:32.96 --> 01:03:34.96
So people freak out about it.

866
01:03:34.96 --> 01:03:35.96
Yeah.

867
01:03:35.96 --> 01:03:38.96
We'll seem like that's more of a comfort zone thing.

868
01:03:38.96 --> 01:03:40.96
Of course, if that's a comfort zone, it's a definite comfort zone.

869
01:03:40.96 --> 01:03:42.96
You know what I actually can say?

870
01:03:42.96 --> 01:03:44.96
I don't think I've ever, I'm trying to think.

871
01:03:44.96 --> 01:03:49.96
I don't think I've seen it yet, where the mission critical guy got fired and things fell upon.

872
01:03:49.96 --> 01:03:51.96
Yeah.

873
01:03:51.96 --> 01:03:53.96
I don't think I've seen it.

874
01:03:53.96 --> 01:03:54.96
I don't think I've seen it.

875
01:03:54.96 --> 01:03:56.96
I don't think I've seen it.

876
01:03:56.96 --> 01:03:57.96
Yeah.

877
01:03:57.96 --> 01:03:58.96
No, I haven't seen it.

878
01:03:58.96 --> 01:04:00.96
Maybe someone will happen one day.

879
01:04:00.96 --> 01:04:01.96
Maybe.

880
01:04:01.96 --> 01:04:02.96
All right.

881
01:04:02.96 --> 01:04:03.96
Next question.

882
01:04:03.96 --> 01:04:06.96
Squish.

883
01:04:06.96 --> 01:04:10.96
I started working for a new company about four months ago, although,

884
01:04:10.96 --> 01:04:16.96
although new to this particular field, my previous experience in skill set directly applies to the work I do now.

885
01:04:16.96 --> 01:04:21.96
I'm assigned to work with an experience quote unquote mentor who has me do busy work

886
01:04:21.96 --> 01:04:24.96
or tasks that are well beneath my capabilities,

887
01:04:24.96 --> 01:04:30.96
leaving me feeling underutilized for the more when I see the quality of work this person

888
01:04:30.96 --> 01:04:31.96
executes.

889
01:04:31.96 --> 01:04:34.96
I'm confident I could upperform him.

890
01:04:34.96 --> 01:04:39.96
And yet he treats me like an idiot, where a new quote of newbie.

891
01:04:39.96 --> 01:04:47.96
He also milks the clock disappearing for long stretches at a time and spending a lot of time on his phone.

892
01:04:47.96 --> 01:04:51.96
To further complicate matters, he's well connected to our upper management.

893
01:04:51.96 --> 01:04:59.96
What is the best course of action if my goal is to get noticed as someone who can perform the quality work that our clients demand?

894
01:04:59.96 --> 01:05:03.96
Best course of action?

895
01:05:03.96 --> 01:05:07.96
Perform the quality work that the client demand, that that's the best course of action.

896
01:05:07.96 --> 01:05:12.96
That's it.

897
01:05:12.96 --> 01:05:15.96
Warm card.

898
01:05:15.96 --> 01:05:19.96
Over deliver.

899
01:05:19.96 --> 01:05:20.96
Get after it.

900
01:05:20.96 --> 01:05:22.96
That's the number one thing you can do.

901
01:05:22.96 --> 01:05:26.94
Now, that you got an opportunity here.

902
01:05:26.94 --> 01:05:28.96
If you have a human heart that you use.

903
01:05:28.96 --> 01:05:38.96
your your mentor disappears for long stretches. Good. Let him go. Take a long lunch boss.

904
01:05:38.96 --> 01:05:46.96
I got it. Oh, you want to find these meaty little tasks. Well, eventually he if he's going to take all these breaks, then he's going to have you do the the more meaning for work.

905
01:05:46.96 --> 01:05:55.96
So that's fine. Um, you, you can do better work than him. Good. That's going to be fine. That's going to show through eventually.

906
01:05:55.96 --> 01:06:00.96
He's well connected up the chain of command. Beautiful. Beautiful.

907
01:06:00.96 --> 01:06:06.96
Because if you can now build a relationship with him, you're going to be well connected to.

908
01:06:06.96 --> 01:06:14.96
And that's going to be the hardest part, right? The heart. That's going to be hard to do. And it's especially hard to do because your attitude right now is negative.

909
01:06:14.96 --> 01:06:20.96
Right. You're attitude right now is negative. It's a little ego kicking in. I can do better than him.

910
01:06:20.96 --> 01:06:28.96
He's I'm under the utilized. He's his he does things are he's making me do things beneath my capabilities. Those are all just ego. It's fine.

911
01:06:28.96 --> 01:06:34.96
We, you go as a good. You go. It's got a lot of positive. See what they just what's driving you to want to do better. So it's okay.

912
01:06:34.96 --> 01:06:42.96
But you're going to have to overcome that in this scenario in order to build a relationship with this guy.

913
01:06:42.96 --> 01:06:56.96
Man, I built relationships with guys that I hated. You know, I mean, because guess what? Does that make me too face? No, you know what? It's my job. I'm a professional.

914
01:06:56.96 --> 01:07:11.96
I am a professional. I guarantee you. You coming to work with me. You will see. I am a professional. And yet I will build relationships. So not and yet, but so that means my job and my professionalism is more important than my ego.

915
01:07:11.96 --> 01:07:32.96
And my, and my, my, my, my, my creativity of other people, right? I'm not looking down on him going on. So because what I want to do is build a good relationship. So when we build that good relationship with him. Now he's if he's well connected with the folks up top. They're like, oh, what's up with Billy.

916
01:07:32.96 --> 01:07:48.96
Oh, Billy's good to go man. He's doing a great job. Now what if you're like with the thing that the other, so what you got to be careful of what you don't want to do is create an antagonistic relationship with him. And that includes threatening him with your

917
01:07:48.96 --> 01:08:07.96
work ethic, threatening him with your performance level, threatening him with your skills. So you almost have to throttle back just a little bit enough that he's not threatened. Now the other thing you could do instead of throttling back is what you do is you give him the credit.

918
01:08:07.96 --> 01:08:19.96
And now he's like a pumped. He's not looking, you become you build the relationship. That's what we want to do. We want to build a relationship. And we want to put your ego and check do the little,

919
01:08:19.96 --> 01:08:48.96
let me tell you all this. This temporary, you will rise top if you do it right, you will rise the top. If you screw it up, you'll never rise. If you create an antagonistic relationship with him, you will not promote. You will not if you do it right, you will end up above him in the chain of command. It will take time. It will take swallowing of pride.

920
01:08:48.96 --> 01:08:56.96
But it will happen. It might take five years. It might take seven years. It might take nine months. I don't know.

921
01:08:56.96 --> 01:09:06.96
But that's what you have to do to make it happen. And have fun doing it. If you're going to go crazy every day, if it's hurt you so bad, I make a game out of it.

922
01:09:06.96 --> 01:09:19.96
I mean, I'm going to make a total game out of it. Where my goal is to build this relationship with this guy. I'm going to make a game out of it. We're going to have fun with it. I'm not going to be angry when I come home for more than a car. I can't believe I had to shake his hand now.

923
01:09:19.96 --> 01:09:23.96
I'm going to come back like, you know what, hey, talk to my wife. Was a, hey, guess what?

924
01:09:23.96 --> 01:09:33.96
He actually bought me lunch today. And we were laughing about the football game. I don't even like football. You know what I'm going to, I'm going to build that. And I'm going to win.

925
01:09:33.96 --> 01:09:52.96
And in the long run, you're guaranteed to win if you can play that game. So again, everyone thinks it's going to be like, you just not me because I was in the military. You just not meet the standards. What you do is you smash him and report him up the chain of command. Oh, that good luck with that. You have this guy as well connected in his relationship with everyone. They're going to go, you let's shut up new guy.

926
01:09:52.96 --> 01:10:05.96
Because you're actually proving not only you're actually proving when you do this, you're actually proving that you're not a good leader and that you're, you can't put your ego in check. You're proving that you can't work with some people.

927
01:10:05.96 --> 01:10:07.96
When you that guy.

928
01:10:07.96 --> 01:10:09.96
Oh, jocco he.

929
01:10:09.96 --> 01:10:11.96
Jocco can't work with anybody.

930
01:10:11.96 --> 01:10:19.96
Jocco's really good as long as you're working with his team. So what, what does that mean? You have means you're confined for the rest of your life of only working with your team.

931
01:10:19.96 --> 01:10:25.96
Whereas if it's hey, jocco's good to go, he can work with anybody. Oh, he worked with Bill who's an ego maniac and he worked with Mike who's a lazy bastard.

932
01:10:25.96 --> 01:10:30.96
Guess what? Doesn't matter where you put jocco. He's going to get it done. Okay, cool. That's the attitude we want people to have about us.

933
01:10:30.96 --> 01:10:36.96
Yeah, then what even that is like, and it's it's an art, you know, of course it is.

934
01:10:36.96 --> 01:10:49.96
You're like, you're kind of balancing because you want to be like disingenuous or like or fake to the point where they know like all this is fake. Oh, yeah, you just like that balance. And you know how you do that.

935
01:10:49.96 --> 01:10:59.96
You don't be fake right? You're not just trying to, I'm not see this is the thing. I'm not trying to build a relationship with echo so that I can get promoted.

936
01:10:59.96 --> 01:11:09.96
That will be obvious. I'm trying to build a relationship with you because it's going to make our team better and it's going to make us do a better job and it's going to benefit everyone at the company and at the team.

937
01:11:09.96 --> 01:11:12.96
That's why I'm trying to do it. I'm not trying to do it so I can get ahead.

938
01:11:12.96 --> 01:11:20.96
If you're not kind of snake, well, then you're just as bad as the other guy. You're just one of those guys that's trying to get ahead. No, what you're doing is you're doing it for the benefit of the team.

939
01:11:20.96 --> 01:11:30.96
I wasn't forming relationships with people so I could get promoted. I was forming relationships with people so that we could do better jobs. So I could get gear for the platoon.

940
01:11:30.96 --> 01:11:36.96
So I could get support from some, you know, supply guy.

941
01:11:36.96 --> 01:11:43.96
Oh, yeah, what's up, buddy? I'm not doing it disingenuously. I actually want to be bros with them. So he knows what we got and who knows what we need.

942
01:11:43.96 --> 01:11:54.96
Nothing didn't disingenuous about that. I'll talk about football. Maybe that's a little disingenuous. You know, well, yeah, if you say you like, you don't mean yeah, but that kind of seems like it's superficial.

943
01:11:54.96 --> 01:12:03.96
But you know what, you know, you're so into football and we're working together. I'm going to actually try and figure out like I want to know why you're so into it, man. Tell me about it.

944
01:12:03.96 --> 01:12:15.96
You know, what's so like, like explain that to me. You got 300 pound guys that can run 40 out 40 yards and like seconds. That's impressive. Let me learn about that. Let's get into the game.

945
01:12:15.96 --> 01:12:18.96
Nothing wrong with that. Not disingenuous.

946
01:12:18.96 --> 01:12:37.96
300 pound guy running a 40 in five point. Oh or less is officially impressive. Yeah, five point or less. 300 pound. If you're 185, even two out. He's 200 pounds.

947
01:12:37.96 --> 01:12:51.96
Four, four, four, four, four, four in less. What'd you do for 47? It's a little less impressive. It's I mean for college. It's good. I mean, especially back in.

948
01:12:51.96 --> 01:13:04.96
Now days guys are fine. It's different now. And it was a long ago. Yeah. Anyway. Next question. Next question.

949
01:13:04.96 --> 01:13:17.96
This question is from an army vet that was in Ramadi in 2004. Yeah. He noted that to me. Yeah, which is good to hear. Yeah. Some contact your fans. Yeah.

950
01:13:17.96 --> 01:13:28.96
Just started jujitsu boom. I'm a very, I'm a very step action drill oriented guy. I blame the field artillery officer basic course.

951
01:13:28.96 --> 01:13:37.96
Today, while training and instructor was talking to me about the flow and creativity and improvisation that is needed. I'm assuming it comes with time.

952
01:13:37.96 --> 01:13:48.96
Any ideas? I'm helping to get that way or sorry. Any ideas unhelping to get away from the step action drill mindset? We're just letting it come.

953
01:13:48.96 --> 01:13:58.96
Yeah. That's great. And I know you've seen people like this in the Jets. I see him all the time. It's people that have the personality that is like an engineer personality.

954
01:13:58.96 --> 01:14:05.96
Okay. What do I do? Step one? Step two? Step three? Step four? What do you tell me the steps?

955
01:14:05.96 --> 01:14:17.96
I'll quit all this conceptual stuff. Tell me the steps to do. And actually, Higgs was just Jeff Higgs. He was describing a guy that we trained with.

956
01:14:17.96 --> 01:14:25.96
And the way he described this scenario, he's talking about the specific guy who kind of fits this mold.

957
01:14:25.96 --> 01:14:35.96
He was this guy was coming to train with us and going to be one of our students in Higgs goes, yeah, you know, he's really good. He's got, you know, he trained super hard. He's strong.

958
01:14:35.96 --> 01:14:51.96
And he's got a very stubborn Jetsu mind which I got a kick out of. And it's true. But it's this kind of thing where, you know, you just want to know the steps and you just want to apply him. And by the way, if you want to teach about options.

959
01:14:51.96 --> 01:15:03.96
Tell me what the options are then, you know, option one one A one B one C they want to have that mindset for everything. So.

960
01:15:03.96 --> 01:15:14.96
That stops you right. We we want to get beyond that. We want to get to it's just like a person playing a musical instrument. You can teach them all the notes.

961
01:15:14.96 --> 01:15:32.96
But they need to figure out how to play music, right? They need to figure out how to create music. That's a difference. I always say this when, um, if you go to a guitar center, which is a guitar store in America, and you put up a sign that says, you know, I need someone that can play the following 27 albums note for note.

962
01:15:32.96 --> 01:15:59.96
You'll get you'll get a hundred phone calls if you put a website to say that because you're going to record an album or never. But of all those people, not all of them can create a musical song that is original and good and all that. So there's the difference, right? This is the difference between like a normal Jetsu player who's by the book and, and then, you know, a person that creates the top level guys that are creating new moves all the time.

963
01:15:59.96 --> 01:16:11.96
So that's what we want to become. And it's not just to be a top level guy. It's also to be, it's also how you improve. It's how you get better. You got to figure out how to match the how to put the notes of Jetsu together.

964
01:16:11.96 --> 01:16:36.96
So, and on top of that, it's the same thing with combat. It's the same thing with doing an assault. It's the same thing within immediate action drill. It's the same thing with moving down a hallway. If all you know and all you can do in your brain is follow the steps and follow the standard operating procedures as much as I talk about standard operating procedures being necessary and mandatory.

965
01:16:36.96 --> 01:16:46.96
If all you know how to do is follow them, you will fall short and you will come into a situation where they're not going to work and now you're going to be done. You're going to stop. You're not going to want to do.

966
01:16:46.96 --> 01:16:55.96
That happens to you to all the time. So we need to free our mind. That's what we need to do. We need to free your mind. And how do you do that? Well, first of all, discipline equals freedom.

967
01:16:55.96 --> 01:17:10.96
So we want to have the disciplines. Means we do need to drill the moves. It means we do need to learn the moves. It means we do need to repeat them over and over again so that we get good at them. We do need to do that. But then we've got to set the mind free and how do you do that. I mean.

968
01:17:10.96 --> 01:17:25.96
Go outside of your comfort zone for one and a lot of guys, everyone does this where you say, you know what man, I'm getting everyone in this one move. I'm going to stop doing it. I'm going to do another move. I'm not going to do 18 anyone for two months. You know, I'm not going to come to your echo.

969
01:17:25.96 --> 01:17:46.96
Yeah, you know, you're going to do it. Yeah. So go outside your comfort zone work on some that work on some move that you don't do throw out your best submission and don't use it. So now you've got to be going through all these different different we got to go for different moves. You got to get creative. Same thing with hitting.

970
01:17:46.96 --> 01:18:13.96
You're moving from different positions that were supposed to work. Like for instance, you just talked about the G. T. I'm a fan of the G. T. But I do G. T. T. I'm in weird places. I mean, I have people tap out to my G. T. When I'm when we're in weird positions that no you like no one's ever been tapped out and they're like, I don't know how I just got to tap out. How did you do that? How did you do that? I was, you know, across the side and I was, yeah, you were, but I had this going on.

971
01:18:13.96 --> 01:18:22.96
So try your move from different positions random positions. Do try things that shouldn't work to try and move that's a top move, try from the bottom.

972
01:18:22.96 --> 01:18:32.96
Try moving that's a move from the bottom, try from the top, try from the side, try from cross side, try from butterfly guard try these different moves and you'll start to create more.

973
01:18:32.96 --> 01:18:44.96
The other thing that will for your mind is when you stop worrying about tapping people out and getting tapped out. We're about progress. We're about creativity. Try and be more creative.

974
01:18:44.96 --> 01:18:53.96
And if all you're worried about is not tapping out, your progress is going to be slow. And if all you're worried about is tapping the other guy out, your progress is going to be slow.

975
01:18:53.96 --> 01:19:11.96
So that's it. And I will actually one more thing I would say, there's a kind of a dichotomy here in the one side you want to be able to turn your brain completely off and just do whatever happens.

976
01:19:11.96 --> 01:19:17.96
And at the same time you want to force your mind to make yourself do particular moves, right?

977
01:19:17.96 --> 01:19:26.96
So go in one of those. If you're going to think, think about new moves or turn your brain completely off and let things happen as they come.

978
01:19:26.96 --> 01:19:34.96
And then for your mind, the old turning your brain off and letting the moves kind of, it's almost like you're letting the move happen on its own kind of thing.

979
01:19:34.96 --> 01:19:40.96
That comes with time more and more. When you first start that's probably not really going to happen much.

980
01:19:40.96 --> 01:19:52.96
And also, like an example of that is if you were teaching a class and you said, hey, Jockel, come here and you know, I'm going to do this sweep on you and you do the sweep and like I would defend it immediately.

981
01:19:52.96 --> 01:19:58.96
And I'm sorry, man. And I'd have to sit there not defend the moves that you could show the sweep.

982
01:19:58.96 --> 01:20:07.96
You seem to say, like, it's in complete instinct for me to stop that move or to complete instinct for me to grab your hand or stop you know, so that's the way that's the way it works. You want that.

983
01:20:07.96 --> 01:20:13.96
Yeah, you want it to be an instinct. You want all you're most to be instinctual because if you have to think about them in real situations.

984
01:20:13.96 --> 01:20:19.96
If the other person is good, then you have to think about what you're going to do. You're going to lose.

985
01:20:19.96 --> 01:20:24.96
Yeah, because they're not thinking they're getting that quarter second. It takes a quarter second to process.

986
01:20:24.96 --> 01:20:33.96
When we said, shooting pistols, it takes a quarter second for you to see the target a quarter second to get to your whole certain quarter second to get to go down and get the shot out. The three quarters of a second.

987
01:20:33.96 --> 01:20:41.96
So if you all you had to do is just drawn shoot, you'd go quarter seconds gone or if you have the gun in your hand or quarter seconds gone.

988
01:20:41.96 --> 01:20:46.96
So actually Greg Train, you did that the other day and I thought about that. That's why this is fresh in my mind.

989
01:20:46.96 --> 01:20:57.96
Like he grabbed my hand real quick and I was like, oh, he did that sort of like, I used to go for my whole story because you can go as fast as you possibly can to your holster. Once you get to your holster, you got to slow down.

990
01:20:57.96 --> 01:21:04.96
You can go so fast to your holster. That's why I used to make up so much. You know, it's fast as I could. My whole story then again, and then once you get there, you got to slow down. You got to get front side focus.

991
01:21:04.96 --> 01:21:09.96
But Greg Train moved that fast trying to grab my hand like that. And I was like, I'm going to start doing that.

992
01:21:09.96 --> 01:21:12.96
Those are doing that again. Do little speed work on him.

993
01:21:12.96 --> 01:21:18.96
Yeah, so yeah, free your mind. Back to the point here and thanks for your service.

994
01:21:18.96 --> 01:21:25.96
Yeah, that way of learning. I think it's it's actually pretty prevalent when you first start because you don't know, you don't know the move.

995
01:21:25.96 --> 01:21:32.96
You don't know why it works. You know that it works because your teacher is teaching it to you, but you didn't know like why it works. So say, all right, just show me.

996
01:21:32.96 --> 01:21:39.96
Tell me this step to do it. You walk through it. You learn another movie. Learn this movie. You learn, you know, he refines your technique. You go roll.

997
01:21:39.96 --> 01:21:45.96
You find out, okay, that doesn't work when I do it this way or you don't know why it doesn't work. So you get asked.

998
01:21:45.96 --> 01:21:56.96
And I'm the kind of learner that I will I actually the first thing I want to know is how does this work. Yeah, I want to know that before I know even the steps.

999
01:21:56.96 --> 01:22:01.96
Yeah, and a lot of times I teach that way. I'm teaching like here's the concept of what we're trying to make happen.

1000
01:22:01.96 --> 01:22:12.96
Yeah, we're trying to get their weight over here. So here's how we're going to get their weight over there. Now, once we get their weight over there, and it's easy to say, hey, I'm not going to do this slip your hips here and you're going to be on their back or whatever the case may be.

1001
01:22:12.96 --> 01:22:24.96
But for me, the concept of what you're trying to make happen is what I like to think about and it's what I like to teach. And that's the same thing with combat. You know, there's moves that you're going to do on the battlefield.

1002
01:22:24.96 --> 01:22:33.96
But conceptually, what are you trying to make happen? You know, cover and move is cover and move is the most simple one. You can cover and move an infinite number of ways.

1003
01:22:33.96 --> 01:22:48.96
But if you don't cover and move, you're going to die. And as long as you have one of those millions of different ways of covering and moving, and I like some guys would get really particular in my when I was running training guys, but you can't do that.

1004
01:22:48.96 --> 01:23:01.96
And I would say, well, what did they do that you didn't like? Well, you know, he, he should have gone. He should have moved first. Well, did the other guy cover him? Well, yeah, well, why should the other guy have gone first? Well, that's the way we taught him.

1005
01:23:01.96 --> 01:23:13.96
Okay, well, does it make sense? Can you give me a reason? Not really. Are they covering and moving? Yes. All right. I think they're good. Yeah, you're right. They probably are.

1006
01:23:13.96 --> 01:23:26.96
So yeah, yeah, that's, it goes along too very much. It seems like anyway, what you're saying about telling people why they're doing what they're doing.

1007
01:23:26.96 --> 01:23:39.96
Yes. So it's essentially the same thing in your jitz or your right, because if you just say grab their arm and pull it into your, you know, neck. So you can sweep them.

1008
01:23:39.96 --> 01:23:44.96
But what you really want to tell them is like, listen, they're going to put their hand out here for base for balance.

1009
01:23:44.96 --> 01:23:58.96
So what you want to do is you want to be ready to move it or move it and you only have to get it to you only have to take their base away for a quarter second. You know, I say that a lot. I say that a lot. Like people in jitz who they try and move.

1010
01:23:58.96 --> 01:24:11.96
They try and they try and affect the other person's body for an extended period of time for 10 seconds for 12 seconds. They try and bring the hand into them so they can sweep them and they hold it there for five seconds.

1011
01:24:11.96 --> 01:24:26.96
I'm going to hold it for a quarter second because that's all it takes for a sweep to happen. It's all it takes for an arm lock to happen. That's all it takes for a geetting to happen is that one quarter second. It's in quarter second is all you're trying to do. And once you want you are winning quarter second quarter second, you're one.

1012
01:24:26.96 --> 01:24:41.96
But again, I do feel like that. I mean, it's probably what I'm imagining. It's a spectrum with learning jitz who like, you know, I say some guys they just tend to learn that way. And then some guys tend to learn the other way.

1013
01:24:41.96 --> 01:24:53.96
Yeah, both ways is fine. And I think in the beginning, I know, was for me and most people that I've seen in the beginning, you just tend to learn that way. Show me this stuff. You don't know everything. You don't know.

1014
01:24:53.96 --> 01:25:01.96
And even me, I mean, I'm the, I'm I'm probably pretty fond of the extreme spectrum of let me understand the concept.

1015
01:25:01.96 --> 01:25:15.96
And plus your advance though, I think no, no, I was beginning. Oh, in the beginning even I was like, okay, how is this working? I was like, show me how to do that was thinking how did that happen? How why am I tapping right now?

1016
01:25:15.96 --> 01:25:23.96
Yeah, how can I not move? You know, that's what I was thinking. I wasn't thinking show me the movement. I was thinking, what is going on?

1017
01:25:23.96 --> 01:25:35.96
Right. Yeah. Yeah. And there's, and there's actually high level guys you can tell by the way that they teach or the way that they, yeah, by the way that they teach or train, you can tell that there's high level guys on both sides.

1018
01:25:35.96 --> 01:25:41.96
There's high level guys that are like, like, for instance, guys that drill all the time, those are the guys that are mechanical.

1019
01:25:41.96 --> 01:25:54.96
And they're all working wrong with it. They win world champions championships. So with that. And then there's guys that don't drill, but they roll like crazy. And their games will reflect that Jeff Glover Jeff Glover Dean, Lister, same thing.

1020
01:25:54.96 --> 01:26:12.96
You don't see those guys doing a lot of drilling. It's not that they never do it, but if you compare them to let's say, who's a world champion? I mean, even Galvao Galvao's a driller. He just will drill.

1021
01:26:12.96 --> 01:26:18.96
And at least for what I've seen, you know, for what I've seen in videos of him training, he's working to move. And you're like, okay, that's awesome.

1022
01:26:18.96 --> 01:26:36.96
Guys dominate, dominate. Fantastic, you're juicer. Yeah, and I think at the end when you become that good, even if that's your primarily method of learning or training or whatever, I think when you gain ultimately like the understanding of, okay, I see why this is important to do this or important not to do this, whatever.

1023
01:26:36.96 --> 01:26:46.96
Even if you are a cool and cool and cool driller, the creativity part is it's almost like it's uncontainable. It'll all be like, even like Galvao were they do drill a lot.

1024
01:26:46.96 --> 01:26:52.96
You know what I was like, maybe I wasn't thinking, who made the DVD that was literally called drill to win?

1025
01:26:52.96 --> 01:26:58.96
There's like one, somebody that's really good made a drill to win, right? So that's the kind of attitude I'm talking about again, that's how you get better.

1026
01:26:58.96 --> 01:27:08.96
Right drilling drilling drilling and what the thing is to respond to what you just said is fact discipline equals freedom.

1027
01:27:08.96 --> 01:27:13.96
If you drill and drill and drill and you make those moves so natural, then you're going to free your going to get them from all over the place.

1028
01:27:13.96 --> 01:27:21.96
So you're right, the end state is going to be the same, but there's going to be people on all lens of that learning spectrum and training spectrum.

1029
01:27:21.96 --> 01:27:26.96
They're going to be all over the place. And some people like like, I don't like to drill, don't enjoy it.

1030
01:27:26.96 --> 01:27:32.96
Maybe I did it at some point, don't remember, but I would rather roll.

1031
01:27:32.96 --> 01:27:42.96
Yeah, I think a lot of, again, it went in the beginning, it seems like what kind of learner you are is going to show itself.

1032
01:27:42.96 --> 01:27:51.96
Way more. Oh yeah, for sure. It's far as even for friends and how you pick things up. And a lot goes with the fact that there's a lot too pick up when you begin.

1033
01:27:51.96 --> 01:27:55.96
You know, there's so much to learn. So you're like, well, you absolutely have to drill.

1034
01:27:55.96 --> 01:27:58.96
I mean, I hope no one's listening me going, well, jogger does really slow.

1035
01:27:58.96 --> 01:28:02.96
No, you have to drill when you start off. You have to, you have to learn the body mechanics of it.

1036
01:28:02.96 --> 01:28:05.96
So, yeah, I am talking about a more advanced stage.

1037
01:28:05.96 --> 01:28:17.96
And I think ultimately, just like how you said though, I think that in time, once you start learning the moves and as given the fact that you are rolling them, you know how some people they'll learn the move, then they'll go home.

1038
01:28:17.96 --> 01:28:18.96
Oh yeah, it's very good.

1039
01:28:18.96 --> 01:28:19.96
Yeah, it's very good.

1040
01:28:19.96 --> 01:28:26.96
But when you learn whatever this guard pass to the arm bar combo, right, and you know the steps and grab here, put your knee here, whatever.

1041
01:28:26.96 --> 01:28:32.96
The guys you're training partner, your partner for the drill or whatever is, you know, he's letting you do it.

1042
01:28:32.96 --> 01:28:40.96
You become a 10 out of 10 in the drill. You get so good at that drill, you're 10 out of 10. When you go to a blind for real, you're still going to fail.

1043
01:28:40.96 --> 01:28:41.96
Yes, exactly.

1044
01:28:41.96 --> 01:28:44.96
Right. Because you don't know all these dynamic variables coming at you.

1045
01:28:44.96 --> 01:28:46.96
So that's when you gain the understanding.

1046
01:28:46.96 --> 01:28:47.96
Yes.

1047
01:28:47.96 --> 01:28:49.96
That's when more questions are going to pop up. Okay, that need to be answered.

1048
01:28:49.96 --> 01:28:51.96
You answer them and boom, there's your learning right there.

1049
01:28:51.96 --> 01:28:55.96
So the drill is good. Yeah, for the body mechanics, especially at the beginning, because you don't know.

1050
01:28:55.96 --> 01:29:01.96
You don't like, you're talking about your, all your hands, arms, legs, hips, head, everything.

1051
01:29:01.96 --> 01:29:08.96
On position, well, what's even more critical than those things, because all those things are visible, you, you can see them.

1052
01:29:08.96 --> 01:29:15.96
The things that are harder to teach and to understand is the weight distribution.

1053
01:29:15.96 --> 01:29:20.96
And the balance distribution. Those are the things that you can't, you cannot see.

1054
01:29:20.96 --> 01:29:28.96
And there's also one more, which is the tension distribution. Because when I'm pulling on your arm, when I grab your wrist, when I'm holding your wrist,

1055
01:29:28.96 --> 01:29:34.96
I could be putting tension in 360 degrees. Right? And if I'm holding your wrist, I could be moving it.

1056
01:29:34.96 --> 01:29:40.96
I could be putting tension. Now, we no one could tell which way I'm putting pushing or pulling or lifting or dragging.

1057
01:29:40.96 --> 01:29:43.96
No one can tell because your arm is moving.

1058
01:29:43.96 --> 01:29:44.96
Right.

1059
01:29:44.96 --> 01:29:51.96
But the tension, you can't see the balance, you can't see and the, and the, the weight distribution.

1060
01:29:51.96 --> 01:29:55.96
You can't see any of those things and that's why it's very hard to teach him.

1061
01:29:55.96 --> 01:30:00.96
Yeah. And really the only way. And again, back to this thing. It comes with time.

1062
01:30:00.96 --> 01:30:07.96
It's when you roll live with someone. Then you're going to see all these different subtle different scenarios, where the stuff you learned.

1063
01:30:07.96 --> 01:30:16.96
Dean was teaching an arm lock the other day. You know, like a basic arm lock, which I've probably sat there in the class of his been his been his dummy a thousand times.

1064
01:30:16.96 --> 01:30:22.96
And like somebody asked a question, and then he was doing the arm lock to me.

1065
01:30:22.96 --> 01:30:35.96
And I realized something that he was doing that I never noticed before. And it's, it's he's pulling the arm towards his head basically pulling it towards his head.

1066
01:30:35.96 --> 01:30:38.96
Yeah. And I mean in a pretty extreme way.

1067
01:30:38.96 --> 01:30:42.96
And I realized how incredibly effective it was.

1068
01:30:42.96 --> 01:30:45.96
It's, it wasn't holding it. He's pulling it. It was.

1069
01:30:45.96 --> 01:30:51.96
And so like those little things like that. I've, I've been his dummy and maybe you know, just because he always being his dummy,

1070
01:30:51.96 --> 01:31:06.96
he didn't, he didn't remember or didn't think about doing that step. But the way the question got asked and, and even when he's arm lock me thousands of times, he, you know, I didn't notice it. You know, I just thought man, he's got a tight arm lock.

1071
01:31:06.96 --> 01:31:07.96
Right.

1072
01:31:07.96 --> 01:31:14.96
But it's like, okay, that was the detail. And I never, you could watch him do that move to me a thousand times or anyone else a thousand times.

1073
01:31:14.96 --> 01:31:32.96
Then you wouldn't be able to know that detail unless either he told it to you or you felt it. And there's, that's the thing that's crazy about the Gitu. There's all kinds of little little aspects like that balance weight and tension that you just can't, you can't see visually. You can feel him.

1074
01:31:32.96 --> 01:31:40.96
But even if I say, hey, echo, actually you can't feel all of it because you can't feel where I'm putting my weight if I'm putting my weight into the mat.

1075
01:31:40.96 --> 01:31:50.96
You can't feel if I'm heavy over here. You can't feel that. You don't know where I'm having. You just know what I feel heavy, but where's my weight going to be? Now if I'm my weight is on you, you can feel it.

1076
01:31:50.96 --> 01:31:51.96
Yeah, man.

1077
01:31:51.96 --> 01:31:53.96
That's the Gitu.

1078
01:31:53.96 --> 01:31:53.96
That's the Gitu.

1079
01:31:53.96 --> 01:31:57.96
All right. Before we have just a Gitu podcast.

1080
01:31:57.96 --> 01:31:58.96
Yeah.

1081
01:31:58.96 --> 01:32:00.96
Next question.

1082
01:32:00.96 --> 01:32:11.96
Draco, when it comes to leading up the chain, what do you do when your goals aren't seeming to align? Example, making money versus having an impact.

1083
01:32:11.96 --> 01:32:13.96
Okay.

1084
01:32:13.96 --> 01:32:18.96
This is the deal here. The goals have to align.

1085
01:32:18.96 --> 01:32:24.96
They have to align and furthermore, they will align.

1086
01:32:24.96 --> 01:32:30.96
That is, now you might have to go pretty high up the chain to make this happen or you might have to dig pretty hard to make that happen.

1087
01:32:30.96 --> 01:32:32.96
But this is a great example.

1088
01:32:32.96 --> 01:32:35.96
The example is making money versus making an impact.

1089
01:32:35.96 --> 01:32:40.96
And I'm going to tell you that those two actually align.

1090
01:32:40.96 --> 01:32:43.96
How do they align? Well, let me explain.

1091
01:32:43.96 --> 01:32:49.96
If your company makes more money, they will have a bigger impact.

1092
01:32:49.96 --> 01:32:51.96
Right? They will have a bigger impact.

1093
01:32:51.96 --> 01:32:55.96
So let me break it down a little bit.

1094
01:32:55.96 --> 01:32:59.96
So if you want to have a big impact on a client.

1095
01:32:59.96 --> 01:33:05.96
Right? And so what you do is you spend so much time and so much money with that client or with that customer.

1096
01:33:05.96 --> 01:33:18.96
You're going to realize that the company, if you invest that much to a client or to a customer, you invest that much time in that much money, your company is going to go out of business.

1097
01:33:18.96 --> 01:33:22.96
Now how much impact are you having to put that into that client? The answer is zero.

1098
01:33:22.96 --> 01:33:25.96
Now sometimes the opposite happens.

1099
01:33:25.96 --> 01:33:28.96
And this is probably what the question is related to.

1100
01:33:28.96 --> 01:33:34.96
For instance, if we as a company, we start cutting corners on quality.

1101
01:33:34.96 --> 01:33:37.96
We start cutting corners on customer service.

1102
01:33:37.96 --> 01:33:42.96
Or whatever the case may be, we might make more money in the short term.

1103
01:33:42.96 --> 01:33:43.96
Oh, like to save money.

1104
01:33:43.96 --> 01:33:44.96
Yeah, we save money.

1105
01:33:44.96 --> 01:33:48.96
You know what, we're supposed to have 10 people answering phones. We're going to fire six of them. We're going to have four left.

1106
01:33:48.96 --> 01:33:50.96
That means everyone's waiting on the phone.

1107
01:33:50.96 --> 01:33:53.96
So when we don't have good customer service, now we're starting to write a Yelp review.

1108
01:33:53.96 --> 01:33:55.96
I was on hold for 14 hours.

1109
01:33:55.96 --> 01:33:57.96
I hate this company, right? This happens.

1110
01:33:57.96 --> 01:33:59.96
This is what happens. This is the example.

1111
01:33:59.96 --> 01:34:02.96
So now up the chain of command.

1112
01:34:02.96 --> 01:34:07.96
So before it was look, we need 30 people in the call center to answer the phone.

1113
01:34:07.96 --> 01:34:12.96
And that way everybody gets an answer within 30 seconds when they call in and what customer calls in.

1114
01:34:12.96 --> 01:34:15.96
Okay, we're out of business in a month because we can't afford 30 people.

1115
01:34:15.96 --> 01:34:16.96
So now we have no impact.

1116
01:34:16.96 --> 01:34:21.96
The other end of the spectrum is we have three people in the call center responding to phone calls.

1117
01:34:21.96 --> 01:34:25.96
We everyone has to wait now or now no one, everyone hates our company.

1118
01:34:25.96 --> 01:34:27.96
We also have no impact.

1119
01:34:27.96 --> 01:34:32.96
So the, the, the goals have to be aligned at some case.

1120
01:34:32.96 --> 01:34:35.96
And but the thing is it is a balancing act.

1121
01:34:35.96 --> 01:34:41.96
It's between expenditures for the cost to produce or the customer service.

1122
01:34:41.96 --> 01:34:44.96
And you've got to keep that as low as possible.

1123
01:34:44.96 --> 01:34:58.96
So that money is made, but you can't go so low that quality and customer service and follow on business and customer relations.

1124
01:34:58.96 --> 01:35:00.96
You can't go so low that it gets destroyed.

1125
01:35:00.96 --> 01:35:07.96
And so you as a, as a worker need to realize that your higher ups are trying to balance that.

1126
01:35:07.96 --> 01:35:10.96
And they're saying, hey, you can't dedicate your life.

1127
01:35:10.96 --> 01:35:15.96
Hey, you can't dedicate this much time or you can't dedicate that much time echo you need to spend it too much time with each client.

1128
01:35:15.96 --> 01:35:17.96
You need to get three more clients.

1129
01:35:17.96 --> 01:35:19.96
Well, I can't give them the impact that I want.

1130
01:35:19.96 --> 01:35:21.96
I can't give them the focus.

1131
01:35:21.96 --> 01:35:23.96
Okay, can you handle one more client?

1132
01:35:23.96 --> 01:35:24.96
Yeah, I could probably do that.

1133
01:35:24.96 --> 01:35:28.96
Okay, we're finding the balance that the new and other good restaurant business, right?

1134
01:35:28.96 --> 01:35:39.96
Restaurant business is a really easy simple one to understand because the quality of the food that we get and the quality of the, the, the, the chefs that we have.

1135
01:35:39.96 --> 01:35:46.96
The more it costs to buy the food, the good food and the higher quality chef and cook and help we have, the better the food's going to be.

1136
01:35:46.96 --> 01:35:48.96
Well, all that stuff costs more money.

1137
01:35:48.96 --> 01:35:54.96
So you got to find the, if you, you have a restaurant where the best hamburger in the world, it's $84.

1138
01:35:54.96 --> 01:35:56.96
You're not going to have a line at that place.

1139
01:35:56.96 --> 01:36:00.96
You, you have impact because you're having the best burger in America.

1140
01:36:00.96 --> 01:36:01.96
Guess what?

1141
01:36:01.96 --> 01:36:05.96
You're not going to be a business to have that your impact is going to be zero.

1142
01:36:05.96 --> 01:36:10.96
You're going to have that other side of the spectrum.

1143
01:36:10.96 --> 01:36:13.96
Salmonel a poised because you're, because you're buying cheap stuff.

1144
01:36:13.96 --> 01:36:18.96
You've cut, you know, refrigeration costs and, and that's what you're going out of business too.

1145
01:36:18.96 --> 01:36:23.96
So the goals are aligned at the end of the day because profit equals growth.

1146
01:36:23.96 --> 01:36:26.96
Growth equals impact.

1147
01:36:26.96 --> 01:36:29.96
Now, you know, are there ethical times where someone says, hey, we're screwing over company.

1148
01:36:29.96 --> 01:36:30.96
Yeah, absolutely.

1149
01:36:30.96 --> 01:36:37.96
So the first thing that I've got to do is to make a barcode had to had a, a plague of that type of behavior.

1150
01:36:37.96 --> 01:36:40.96
And it was rampant throughout the whole company.

1151
01:36:40.96 --> 01:36:41.96
Guess where they're at now?

1152
01:36:41.96 --> 01:36:42.96
They're hurting.

1153
01:36:42.96 --> 01:36:44.96
They made a bunch of money in the short term.

1154
01:36:44.96 --> 01:36:45.96
But guess what?

1155
01:36:45.96 --> 01:36:47.96
Now, they're not trusted.

1156
01:36:47.96 --> 01:36:50.96
So they got to do some recuperation.

1157
01:36:50.96 --> 01:36:51.96
But that's a classic example.

1158
01:36:51.96 --> 01:36:54.96
Someone from Wells Fargo might have asked this question.

1159
01:36:54.96 --> 01:36:57.96
You know, a year ago before the story broke and said, hey,

1160
01:36:57.96 --> 01:37:02.96
we're in a positive here and the company, my goal is on a line with the company.

1161
01:37:02.96 --> 01:37:07.96
And he would have been right and he should have raised his hand because what he could have said was, hey, bosses.

1162
01:37:07.96 --> 01:37:11.96
If we keep this up, we're going to lose the trust and confidence of the public.

1163
01:37:11.96 --> 01:37:13.96
And we're going to be hurting.

1164
01:37:13.96 --> 01:37:16.96
And the, you would have been correct.

1165
01:37:16.96 --> 01:37:18.96
So you had to find that balance.

1166
01:37:18.96 --> 01:37:22.96
But just remember that even though the goals might not seem aligned, they are aligned in the end.

1167
01:37:22.96 --> 01:37:25.96
They need to be, not saying they always are.

1168
01:37:25.96 --> 01:37:29.96
But if they're not aligned in the end, you're going to, you're probably going to go out of business.

1169
01:37:29.96 --> 01:37:33.96
Because you just cut a swath of mayhem.

1170
01:37:33.96 --> 01:37:38.96
You've, you've destroyed your customers or either few high prices or by low service.

1171
01:37:38.96 --> 01:37:42.96
One of those two things going to happen if you don't find the dichotomy, the balance, not even dichotomy, the balance.

1172
01:37:42.96 --> 01:37:44.96
You got to find the balance.

1173
01:37:44.96 --> 01:37:45.96
Yeah.

1174
01:37:45.96 --> 01:37:46.96
Yeah.

1175
01:37:48.96 --> 01:37:50.96
Next question.

1176
01:37:52.96 --> 01:37:54.96
What is your next book about?

1177
01:37:54.96 --> 01:37:58.96
Well, the cat is out of the bag essentially now.

1178
01:37:58.96 --> 01:38:02.96
So because the book is available on Amazon right now,

1179
01:38:02.96 --> 01:38:05.96
it's called the way of the warrior kid.

1180
01:38:05.96 --> 01:38:09.96
And yes, it is a kid's book.

1181
01:38:09.96 --> 01:38:22.96
But I am telling you, I'm telling you, I've got, this, this is, this book is going to, there's going to be a lot more people than just kids that learned from this book myself included.

1182
01:38:22.96 --> 01:38:29.96
So, um, and you know, it's a part of its stem, I had it in the bank for a while.

1183
01:38:29.96 --> 01:38:33.96
But one of the things that happened is we talked about the jockel academy on this podcast.

1184
01:38:33.96 --> 01:38:36.96
Hey, what if you ran, somebody asked me the question, great question.

1185
01:38:36.96 --> 01:38:39.96
If you ran a academy for kids, what would you teach?

1186
01:38:39.96 --> 01:38:42.96
And I kind of went through what that would be like.

1187
01:38:42.96 --> 01:38:48.96
And what was cool was when that podcast came out, so many people reached out to me and said,

1188
01:38:48.96 --> 01:38:56.96
you got to do this, this would be awesome and we actually are working behind the scenes slowly to get something moving in that direction.

1189
01:38:56.96 --> 01:39:02.96
But I realized, you know, forming a school the way I want to make it, forming a academy the way I want it to be.

1190
01:39:02.96 --> 01:39:05.96
It's a, it's a big effort. It's a big financial effort.

1191
01:39:05.96 --> 01:39:09.96
But how do we help kids in the meantime, right?

1192
01:39:09.96 --> 01:39:13.96
How do we help kids in the meantime? Well, I realized what I could do is write a book.

1193
01:39:13.96 --> 01:39:19.96
Or finish this book that I had the idea for. So that's what I did hammered it out.

1194
01:39:19.96 --> 01:39:22.96
And this is the story. It's, it's about a kid.

1195
01:39:22.96 --> 01:39:33.96
Kid, name is Mark. And when the story opens up, he's just kind of finishing his, his last couple days of school.

1196
01:39:33.96 --> 01:39:35.96
And he's having a rough time.

1197
01:39:35.96 --> 01:39:39.96
He's having a rough time because he's,

1198
01:39:39.96 --> 01:39:45.96
well, first of all, he can't do any pull ups, which may not seem like a big deal, but guess what?

1199
01:39:45.96 --> 01:39:50.96
In his school, they have little, physical P.E. tests and one of the things they got to do is pull up.

1200
01:39:50.96 --> 01:39:55.96
And so the last day of school, they, you know, they feel, they feel day and Hawaii.

1201
01:39:55.96 --> 01:39:58.96
So they have field day. So he's just one of the events they do.

1202
01:39:58.96 --> 01:40:00.96
It's pull up. Somebody pull up. It's going to everyone do.

1203
01:40:00.96 --> 01:40:02.96
He's hiding in the back.

1204
01:40:02.96 --> 01:40:04.96
Trying to hide. He doesn't want to do the pull up.

1205
01:40:04.96 --> 01:40:09.96
There, but guess what? He gets called out. So everybody knows confirmed. They knew before.

1206
01:40:09.96 --> 01:40:13.96
Some of the, I was confirmed he can't. He doesn't that kid can't do any pull ups.

1207
01:40:13.96 --> 01:40:16.96
Class field trip. Guess where they go.

1208
01:40:16.96 --> 01:40:19.96
They go to a pond. They go to a lake and they go swimming.

1209
01:40:19.96 --> 01:40:20.96
Real fun.

1210
01:40:20.96 --> 01:40:24.96
If you know how to swim. Mark doesn't know how to swim.

1211
01:40:24.96 --> 01:40:27.96
So he's, and now they know that too.

1212
01:40:27.96 --> 01:40:30.96
Not only that on top of that,

1213
01:40:30.96 --> 01:40:36.96
it doesn't know his time stables. What six times six don't know.

1214
01:40:36.96 --> 01:40:40.96
So on top of all that, he's getting bullied.

1215
01:40:40.96 --> 01:40:46.96
He's getting bullied by big Kenny Williams and big bully.

1216
01:40:46.96 --> 01:40:51.96
Who, who calls himself, he calls himself the king of the jungle.

1217
01:40:51.96 --> 01:40:53.96
Because the jungle gym in the school yard.

1218
01:40:53.96 --> 01:40:54.96
Yeah.

1219
01:40:54.96 --> 01:40:55.96
It's a great, got it.

1220
01:40:55.96 --> 01:40:59.96
So horrible last day of school gets picked on all that stuff.

1221
01:40:59.96 --> 01:41:06.96
And when he comes home, he's reminded by his mom that his uncle,

1222
01:41:06.96 --> 01:41:09.96
Uncle Jake, who is in the seal teams?

1223
01:41:09.96 --> 01:41:11.96
Of course. He's getting out of the seal teams.

1224
01:41:11.96 --> 01:41:14.96
He's going to be going to college after the summer.

1225
01:41:14.96 --> 01:41:17.96
So this summer, he's staying with Mark.

1226
01:41:17.96 --> 01:41:20.96
And that's what happens. So Uncle Jake,

1227
01:41:20.96 --> 01:41:23.96
you know, he kind of hears all these issues that he's having.

1228
01:41:23.96 --> 01:41:26.96
All these problems. And you can imagine what Uncle Jake said.

1229
01:41:26.96 --> 01:41:28.96
Uncle Jake said good.

1230
01:41:28.96 --> 01:41:32.96
You got problems. Those are the problems kind of problems we can solve right there.

1231
01:41:32.96 --> 01:41:34.96
We can take care of you. Can't do polips? No problem.

1232
01:41:34.96 --> 01:41:36.96
What do we do? We work out.

1233
01:41:36.96 --> 01:41:39.96
Oh, you don't know your time stables. What do you do?

1234
01:41:39.96 --> 01:41:41.96
Study. Let me teach you how to study.

1235
01:41:41.96 --> 01:41:44.96
Let me show you about flash cards.

1236
01:41:44.96 --> 01:41:49.96
Let me show you how to get in the game academically.

1237
01:41:49.96 --> 01:41:52.96
Oh, you don't know how to swim? Guess what?

1238
01:41:52.96 --> 01:41:54.96
You're going to learn how to swim.

1239
01:41:54.96 --> 01:41:56.96
Oh, and you, and you're getting picked on.

1240
01:41:56.96 --> 01:41:58.96
How do we stop that real easy?

1241
01:41:58.96 --> 01:42:00.96
Little something called dugetz here.

1242
01:42:00.96 --> 01:42:01.96
Of course.

1243
01:42:01.96 --> 01:42:04.96
So that's what happens.

1244
01:42:04.96 --> 01:42:09.96
The Uncle Jake shows Mark how to be.

1245
01:42:09.96 --> 01:42:12.96
He's said of a winpy kid. How to be a warrior kid.

1246
01:42:12.96 --> 01:42:14.96
And.

1247
01:42:14.96 --> 01:42:19.96
Teaching him how to be stronger and smarter and better.

1248
01:42:19.96 --> 01:42:24.96
And it also, you know, he learns about humility.

1249
01:42:24.96 --> 01:42:27.96
He learns about respect.

1250
01:42:27.96 --> 01:42:32.96
He learns about courage and determination.

1251
01:42:32.96 --> 01:42:35.96
And you know.

1252
01:42:35.96 --> 01:42:39.96
I wish that I had this book when I was a kid.

1253
01:42:39.96 --> 01:42:42.96
Because.

1254
01:42:42.96 --> 01:42:44.96
I think it's going to be helpful.

1255
01:42:44.96 --> 01:42:45.96
I think it's to be helpful.

1256
01:42:45.96 --> 01:42:47.96
And that's what that's what I'm hoping for.

1257
01:42:47.96 --> 01:42:50.96
I'm hoping to have an impact on some people's lives.

1258
01:42:50.96 --> 01:42:57.96
And I hope that I hope that it allows, you know, parents and kids to get closer together.

1259
01:42:57.96 --> 01:42:59.96
And.

1260
01:42:59.96 --> 01:43:01.96
You know, as I was.

1261
01:43:01.96 --> 01:43:07.96
You know, I normally take a question for kind of like closing.

1262
01:43:07.96 --> 01:43:08.96
And.

1263
01:43:08.96 --> 01:43:12.96
You know, I, I usually try and pick a question that's going to be, um,

1264
01:43:12.96 --> 01:43:14.96
you know, it's going to be impactful, right?

1265
01:43:14.96 --> 01:43:15.96
Mm-hmm.

1266
01:43:15.96 --> 01:43:17.96
And honestly.

1267
01:43:17.96 --> 01:43:22.96
I mean, when I was preparing for this podcast and I was doing the first couple.

1268
01:43:22.96 --> 01:43:25.96
Letters that I read.

1269
01:43:25.96 --> 01:43:35.96
I was just at a point where.

1270
01:43:35.96 --> 01:43:38.96
I didn't think I'd be able to step it up any further.

1271
01:43:38.96 --> 01:43:40.96
And.

1272
01:43:40.96 --> 01:43:43.96
So I just wanted to.

1273
01:43:43.96 --> 01:43:44.96
Think about that.

1274
01:43:44.96 --> 01:43:46.96
You know, you think about.

1275
01:43:46.96 --> 01:43:51.96
John Burns and his daughter.

1276
01:43:51.96 --> 01:43:54.96
And.

1277
01:43:54.96 --> 01:43:58.96
Makes me hope that.

1278
01:43:58.96 --> 01:44:01.96
This can bring.

1279
01:44:01.96 --> 01:44:02.96
People together.

1280
01:44:02.96 --> 01:44:06.96
Bring parents closer to their kids.

1281
01:44:06.96 --> 01:44:09.96
And help their kids.

1282
01:44:09.96 --> 01:44:13.96
Move down the right path in life.

1283
01:44:13.96 --> 01:44:17.96
Because.

1284
01:44:17.96 --> 01:44:21.96
No matter what you think about.

1285
01:44:21.96 --> 01:44:23.96
Life.

1286
01:44:23.96 --> 01:44:24.96
And the afterlife.

1287
01:44:24.96 --> 01:44:26.96
And immortality.

1288
01:44:26.96 --> 01:44:30.96
And whether you believe that or not.

1289
01:44:30.96 --> 01:44:34.96
One thing I do know.

1290
01:44:34.96 --> 01:44:38.96
Is the one thing that you do leave behind.

1291
01:44:38.96 --> 01:44:41.96
Is your kids.

1292
01:44:41.96 --> 01:44:44.96
So let's give them.

1293
01:44:44.96 --> 01:44:46.96
The best we can.

1294
01:44:46.96 --> 01:44:50.96
And get them prepared for life.

1295
01:44:50.96 --> 01:44:53.96
And get them prepared.

1296
01:44:53.96 --> 01:44:56.96
For the sunny days.

1297
01:44:56.96 --> 01:45:00.96
And the sparkling skies filled with stars.

1298
01:45:00.96 --> 01:45:03.96
And let's also get them ready.

1299
01:45:03.96 --> 01:45:06.96
For the challenges.

1300
01:45:06.96 --> 01:45:09.96
And the bullies.

1301
01:45:09.96 --> 01:45:13.96
And the darkness.

1302
01:45:13.96 --> 01:45:18.96
So that they can.

1303
01:45:18.96 --> 01:45:20.96
Survive.

1304
01:45:20.96 --> 01:45:23.96
And thrive.

1305
01:45:23.96 --> 01:45:28.96
And pass that strength.

1306
01:45:28.96 --> 01:45:32.96
Of character.

1307
01:45:32.96 --> 01:45:37.96
On down the line.

1308
01:45:37.96 --> 01:45:40.96
And I think that's.

1309
01:45:40.96 --> 01:45:43.96
I don't all love God for tonight.

1310
01:45:43.96 --> 01:45:46.96
So.

1311
01:45:46.96 --> 01:45:48.96
Echo Charles.

1312
01:45:48.96 --> 01:45:52.96
I know it's been a little bit of a rough night for you too.

1313
01:45:52.96 --> 01:45:54.96
I apologize.

1314
01:45:54.96 --> 01:45:56.96
But.

1315
01:45:56.96 --> 01:45:58.96
Maybe.

1316
01:45:58.96 --> 01:46:00.96
Maybe when you get home tonight.

1317
01:46:00.96 --> 01:46:04.96
You give your beautiful daughter a little extra hug.

1318
01:46:04.96 --> 01:46:09.96
And you plan a kiss on this forehead of your son.

1319
01:46:09.96 --> 01:46:13.96
And before you do that.

1320
01:46:13.96 --> 01:46:18.96
Maybe you could tell everyone how they might be able to support this podcast.

1321
01:46:18.96 --> 01:46:20.96
If they so does our.

1322
01:46:20.96 --> 01:46:22.96
Before I go too deep into that.

1323
01:46:22.96 --> 01:46:23.96
Let me I got it.

1324
01:46:23.96 --> 01:46:24.96
I got it.

1325
01:46:24.96 --> 01:46:26.96
It meant something.

1326
01:46:26.96 --> 01:46:29.96
But it's going to be relevant to me.

1327
01:46:29.96 --> 01:46:33.96
I worked out because a lot of people in the world just went.

1328
01:46:33.96 --> 01:46:35.96
I worked out.

1329
01:46:35.96 --> 01:46:38.96
I worked out today.

1330
01:46:38.96 --> 01:46:41.96
But this is the admission part.

1331
01:46:41.96 --> 01:46:43.96
I drank some last night.

1332
01:46:43.96 --> 01:46:45.96
Why?

1333
01:46:45.96 --> 01:46:48.96
Just you know sometimes when you.

1334
01:46:48.96 --> 01:46:50.96
Yeah, ultimately.

1335
01:46:50.96 --> 01:46:54.96
But it's one of these things where was it some kind of a celebration?

1336
01:46:54.96 --> 01:46:55.96
No, it was.

1337
01:46:55.96 --> 01:46:56.96
I was just working.

1338
01:46:56.96 --> 01:46:58.96
And you know the kind of you drink a little bit.

1339
01:46:58.96 --> 01:46:59.96
You kind of get into it.

1340
01:46:59.96 --> 01:47:00.96
And then I'm all shoot.

1341
01:47:00.96 --> 01:47:01.96
Let me drink some more and more into it.

1342
01:47:01.96 --> 01:47:02.96
Anyway, just one of those deals.

1343
01:47:02.96 --> 01:47:04.96
Anyway, nonetheless.

1344
01:47:04.96 --> 01:47:07.96
We ended up not getting that much sleep and drinking.

1345
01:47:07.96 --> 01:47:10.96
But I'm like, no, I committed to working out today.

1346
01:47:10.96 --> 01:47:11.96
You held the line.

1347
01:47:11.96 --> 01:47:12.96
Helped the line.

1348
01:47:12.96 --> 01:47:13.96
Yeah, fully.

1349
01:47:13.96 --> 01:47:16.96
So, and we're going back to that pre workout stuff.

1350
01:47:16.96 --> 01:47:17.96
Total performance.

1351
01:47:17.96 --> 01:47:19.96
I think it's called on it.

1352
01:47:19.96 --> 01:47:21.96
Anyway, the pre workout stuff.

1353
01:47:21.96 --> 01:47:22.96
So I'm like, all right.

1354
01:47:22.96 --> 01:47:23.96
Now we're going to.

1355
01:47:23.96 --> 01:47:26.96
We're going to see how this works under Dress.

1356
01:47:26.96 --> 01:47:27.96
If you will.

1357
01:47:27.96 --> 01:47:28.96
Same.

1358
01:47:28.96 --> 01:47:30.96
Anyway, took it.

1359
01:47:30.96 --> 01:47:31.96
Okay.

1360
01:47:31.96 --> 01:47:32.96
So we're going to work out.

1361
01:47:32.96 --> 01:47:33.96
Boom.

1362
01:47:33.96 --> 01:47:34.96
Same pop.

1363
01:47:34.96 --> 01:47:36.96
That pop I was talking about last time was there.

1364
01:47:36.96 --> 01:47:37.96
People mentioned the pop.

1365
01:47:37.96 --> 01:47:38.96
Yeah.

1366
01:47:38.96 --> 01:47:39.96
The pop is real.

1367
01:47:39.96 --> 01:47:41.96
Anyway.

1368
01:47:41.96 --> 01:47:43.96
So the moral to that story is.

1369
01:47:43.96 --> 01:47:45.96
So are you telling everyone they can drink?

1370
01:47:45.96 --> 01:47:48.96
And as long as they have some of this, they'll be good to go.

1371
01:47:48.96 --> 01:47:49.96
Was that I don't want to hear that?

1372
01:47:49.96 --> 01:47:51.96
You would have been you'd had more pop.

1373
01:47:51.96 --> 01:47:52.96
Oh, no.

1374
01:47:52.96 --> 01:47:53.96
A lot more.

1375
01:47:53.96 --> 01:47:54.96
I think.

1376
01:47:54.96 --> 01:47:55.96
He just kept your head in the game.

1377
01:47:55.96 --> 01:47:59.96
Yeah, well, if I were to say that, I would have to do a lot more tests.

1378
01:47:59.96 --> 01:48:00.96
I would have to drink more time.

1379
01:48:00.96 --> 01:48:01.96
Let's not say that.

1380
01:48:01.96 --> 01:48:04.96
Yeah, yeah, so we like the new and improved echo.

1381
01:48:04.96 --> 01:48:05.96
Yeah.

1382
01:48:05.96 --> 01:48:06.96
A lot better.

1383
01:48:06.96 --> 01:48:07.96
Right on.

1384
01:48:07.96 --> 01:48:11.96
But yeah, total performance is a go.

1385
01:48:11.96 --> 01:48:12.96
Straight up go.

1386
01:48:12.96 --> 01:48:13.96
It's in the rotation.

1387
01:48:13.96 --> 01:48:14.96
It is.

1388
01:48:14.96 --> 01:48:15.96
Real oil.

1389
01:48:15.96 --> 01:48:16.96
Real oil.

1390
01:48:16.96 --> 01:48:19.96
Total performance.

1391
01:48:19.96 --> 01:48:21.96
Alpha brain when needed.

1392
01:48:21.96 --> 01:48:24.96
Shroom tech when needed.

1393
01:48:24.96 --> 01:48:25.96
What other ones?

1394
01:48:25.96 --> 01:48:26.96
Did I miss?

1395
01:48:26.96 --> 01:48:28.96
Oh, where are your bars when needed?

1396
01:48:28.96 --> 01:48:29.96
That's my go to.

1397
01:48:29.96 --> 01:48:32.96
This is my EDC everyday consumption.

1398
01:48:32.96 --> 01:48:33.96
Not everyday carry, right?

1399
01:48:33.96 --> 01:48:35.96
Let's see other.

1400
01:48:35.96 --> 01:48:38.96
Anyway, by on it, if you don't know already, I know I said it before.

1401
01:48:38.96 --> 01:48:39.96
I'm going to say it again.

1402
01:48:39.96 --> 01:48:41.96
It's from on it.

1403
01:48:41.96 --> 01:48:42.96
The best supplements.

1404
01:48:42.96 --> 01:48:45.96
Not like power gain or 5,000 supplements.

1405
01:48:45.96 --> 01:48:48.96
Like the for real supplements that, you know.

1406
01:48:48.96 --> 01:48:49.96
But you got to do the workout.

1407
01:48:49.96 --> 01:48:50.96
You got to do get your rest.

1408
01:48:50.96 --> 01:48:51.96
You got to eat good.

1409
01:48:51.96 --> 01:48:53.96
The supplements is to supplement.

1410
01:48:53.96 --> 01:48:55.96
I think people overlooked that.

1411
01:48:55.96 --> 01:48:56.96
You know what?

1412
01:48:56.96 --> 01:48:58.96
Let's make a bar.

1413
01:48:58.96 --> 01:49:01.96
A good protein bar or a good steak bar.

1414
01:49:01.96 --> 01:49:02.96
And what is called good.

1415
01:49:02.96 --> 01:49:05.96
So that way you're going to eat good.

1416
01:49:05.96 --> 01:49:07.96
Are you eating good?

1417
01:49:07.96 --> 01:49:08.96
Yeah.

1418
01:49:08.96 --> 01:49:09.96
What do you know?

1419
01:49:09.96 --> 01:49:12.96
That's a good diet.

1420
01:49:12.96 --> 01:49:16.96
Anyway, if you want to, if you like these things, if you're down,

1421
01:49:16.96 --> 01:49:18.96

01:49:18.96 --> 01:49:20.96

01:49:38.96 --> 01:49:40.96
And your gains.

1433
01:49:40.96 --> 01:49:43.96
Another way.

1434
01:49:43.96 --> 01:49:44.96
Yes.

1435
01:49:44.96 --> 01:49:46.96
Another way to do it is, or do it.

1436
01:49:46.96 --> 01:49:48.96
Meaning another way to support the podcast.

1437
01:49:48.96 --> 01:49:49.96
Big one.

1438
01:49:49.96 --> 01:49:50.96
Small but big.

1439
01:49:50.96 --> 01:49:51.96
Amazon click through.

1440
01:49:51.96 --> 01:49:54.96
What that is before you do Amazon shopping.

1441
01:49:54.96 --> 01:49:56.96
Whatever it is, you're by whether it's the

1442
01:49:56.96 --> 01:50:00.96
book that you write on this podcast, or otherwise, or anything.

1443
01:50:00.96 --> 01:50:04.96
Before you go to Amazon.com, go to jockelpodcast.com.

1444
01:50:04.96 --> 01:50:06.96
Click on the Amazon banner.

1445
01:50:06.96 --> 01:50:07.96
Then you go do your shopping.

1446
01:50:07.96 --> 01:50:09.96
So kind of supports.

1447
01:50:09.96 --> 01:50:11.96
So it's like this three way of support.

1448
01:50:11.96 --> 01:50:12.96
Think.

1449
01:50:12.96 --> 01:50:13.96
Small action.

1450
01:50:13.96 --> 01:50:14.96
Big impact.

1451
01:50:14.96 --> 01:50:16.96
So yeah, that's a good one.

1452
01:50:16.96 --> 01:50:18.96
Subscribe.

1453
01:50:18.96 --> 01:50:21.96
Of course, to iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play.

1454
01:50:21.96 --> 01:50:23.96
Right review on iTunes.

1455
01:50:23.96 --> 01:50:24.96
Yeah.

1456
01:50:24.96 --> 01:50:25.96
That's a good one.

1457
01:50:25.96 --> 01:50:26.96
Yeah.

1458
01:50:26.96 --> 01:50:27.96
Oh, support.

1459
01:50:27.96 --> 01:50:29.96
If you want.

1460
01:50:29.96 --> 01:50:35.96
Anyway, it seems obviously, subscribe to iTunes already, but in the event of you not subscribing.

1461
01:50:35.96 --> 01:50:37.96
Go subscribe if you want to support in that one.

1462
01:50:37.96 --> 01:50:39.96
Whatever it is you want to use Google Play.

1463
01:50:39.96 --> 01:50:40.96
Stitcher.

1464
01:50:40.96 --> 01:50:41.96
Stitcher, yeah.

1465
01:50:41.96 --> 01:50:45.96
There's another app I've been here lately, but I can't remember what it is.

1466
01:50:45.96 --> 01:50:46.96
That's not Spotify.

1467
01:50:46.96 --> 01:50:47.96
Is it?

1468
01:50:47.96 --> 01:50:48.96
That's something else.

1469
01:50:48.96 --> 01:50:49.96
That's not podcast.

1470
01:50:49.96 --> 01:50:50.96
I don't know.

1471
01:50:50.96 --> 01:50:52.96
But yeah, just subscribe.

1472
01:50:52.96 --> 01:50:53.96
Boom.

1473
01:50:53.96 --> 01:50:54.96
So I'm there.

1474
01:50:54.96 --> 01:50:55.96
And then YouTube.

1475
01:50:55.96 --> 01:50:58.96
So I'm going to put out more videos on a more consistent basis.

1476
01:50:58.96 --> 01:50:59.96
I think I put one up today.

1477
01:50:59.96 --> 01:51:00.96
Yesterday.

1478
01:51:00.96 --> 01:51:01.96
Mm.

1479
01:51:01.96 --> 01:51:03.96
Sometime very recently.

1480
01:51:03.96 --> 01:51:07.96
And you want to subscribe to the YouTube channel.

1481
01:51:07.96 --> 01:51:08.96
We'll watch the videos.

1482
01:51:08.96 --> 01:51:11.96
Get updates when one of the videos come out.

1483
01:51:11.96 --> 01:51:13.96
That's a good way to support too.

1484
01:51:13.96 --> 01:51:16.96
And then of course,

1485
01:51:16.96 --> 01:51:17.96
Joc was a store.

1486
01:51:17.96 --> 01:51:18.96
It's called Jocos Store.

1487
01:51:18.96 --> 01:51:20.96
You can get cool stuff.

1488
01:51:20.96 --> 01:51:22.96
I think it's cool.

1489
01:51:22.96 --> 01:51:25.96
And I'm not saying, go buy the shirts.

1490
01:51:25.96 --> 01:51:26.96
I'm not saying that.

1491
01:51:26.96 --> 01:51:28.96
I'm saying go look on there.

1492
01:51:28.96 --> 01:51:32.96
We made an effort collectively to put some cool stuff out there.

1493
01:51:32.96 --> 01:51:34.96
But keeping my nuts are happening.

1494
01:51:34.96 --> 01:51:35.96
That's my opinion.

1495
01:51:35.96 --> 01:51:36.96
That they're cool.

1496
01:51:36.96 --> 01:51:39.96
If you think they're cool, then you get a shirt.

1497
01:51:39.96 --> 01:51:40.96
That's what I'm saying.

1498
01:51:40.96 --> 01:51:41.96
And you can support that way.

1499
01:51:41.96 --> 01:51:45.96
The shirts is rash guards for Jiu Jitsu or any kind of physical activity.

1500
01:51:45.96 --> 01:51:48.96
A lot of people use for cycling and crossfit.

1501
01:51:48.96 --> 01:51:49.96
Why not?

1502
01:51:49.96 --> 01:51:52.96
I'm really good for that.

1503
01:51:52.96 --> 01:51:54.96
They look cool.

1504
01:51:54.96 --> 01:51:55.96
I think they look cool.

1505
01:51:55.96 --> 01:51:56.96
The patches.

1506
01:51:56.96 --> 01:51:58.96
The velcro ones came back in.

1507
01:51:58.96 --> 01:52:00.96
So we got velcro patches back.

1508
01:52:00.96 --> 01:52:02.96
Some bumper stickers.

1509
01:52:02.96 --> 01:52:04.96
And who do these?

1510
01:52:04.96 --> 01:52:05.96
Of course.

1511
01:52:05.96 --> 01:52:07.96
We'll come out somewhere stuff I think.

1512
01:52:07.96 --> 01:52:09.96
I support that.

1513
01:52:09.96 --> 01:52:10.96
You support.

1514
01:52:10.96 --> 01:52:11.96
Okay.

1515
01:52:11.96 --> 01:52:12.96
There you go.

1516
01:52:12.96 --> 01:52:14.96
So yeah, if you want to support that way.

1517
01:52:14.96 --> 01:52:16.96
And Jocos supports this idea.

1518
01:52:16.96 --> 01:52:19.96
So another three way support closed circuit deal.

1519
01:52:19.96 --> 01:52:21.96
That's good getting that.

1520
01:52:21.96 --> 01:52:23.96
If you want, if you like it.

1521
01:52:23.96 --> 01:52:26.96
And then of course, psychological warfare.

1522
01:52:26.96 --> 01:52:27.96
Okay.

1523
01:52:27.96 --> 01:52:29.96
If you don't know what psychological warfare is.

1524
01:52:29.96 --> 01:52:33.96
It's in the album you can get.

1525
01:52:33.96 --> 01:52:37.96
And each track is.

1526
01:52:37.96 --> 01:52:40.96
When you feel weakness of like waking up.

1527
01:52:40.96 --> 01:52:43.96
Like if you're, and you know those days, I'm going to speak from experience.

1528
01:52:43.96 --> 01:52:44.96
Because I know a little bit about this.

1529
01:52:44.96 --> 01:52:47.96
The day where you're kind of hungover.

1530
01:52:47.96 --> 01:52:49.96
I know this was long time ago.

1531
01:52:49.96 --> 01:52:50.96
Maybe you're hungover.

1532
01:52:50.96 --> 01:52:51.96
Maybe you're tired.

1533
01:52:51.96 --> 01:52:52.96
You didn't get that much sleep.

1534
01:52:52.96 --> 01:52:54.96
Maybe maybe your mind is on something else.

1535
01:52:54.96 --> 01:52:57.96
And you're like, I know I told myself I was going to work out today.

1536
01:52:57.96 --> 01:52:58.96
But today I'm not feeling it.

1537
01:52:58.96 --> 01:53:00.96
I'm going to turn today into a rest day.

1538
01:53:00.96 --> 01:53:03.96
When you're thinking that like those moments of weakness.

1539
01:53:03.96 --> 01:53:05.96
You listen to one of these tracks to these tracks.

1540
01:53:05.96 --> 01:53:07.96
Whatever.

1541
01:53:07.96 --> 01:53:12.96
It's Jocos telling you why you should not skip today.

1542
01:53:12.96 --> 01:53:16.96
You see your waging psychological warfare on your mind.

1543
01:53:16.96 --> 01:53:17.96
This is.

1544
01:53:17.96 --> 01:53:18.96
Yes.

1545
01:53:18.96 --> 01:53:20.96
And the weakness is that I try to reveal themselves in your mind.

1546
01:53:20.96 --> 01:53:25.96
And I can say with 100% certainty that if you're having a day of,

1547
01:53:25.96 --> 01:53:28.96
or moment of weakness and you listen to this track,

1548
01:53:28.96 --> 01:53:31.96
whether you're about to eat some, you don't want your hungry.

1549
01:53:31.96 --> 01:53:33.96
When you miss like lunch and you're like,

1550
01:53:33.96 --> 01:53:34.96
Tang, I'm hungry.

1551
01:53:34.96 --> 01:53:39.96
And you see like, in whatever get donuts or orios or whatever.

1552
01:53:39.96 --> 01:53:42.96
When you're real hungry, it's kind of hard.

1553
01:53:42.96 --> 01:53:44.96
Anyway, if you're having a moment of weakness like that,

1554
01:53:44.96 --> 01:53:47.96
whether it be food stuff waking up early,

1555
01:53:47.96 --> 01:53:49.96
skipping workouts, whatever, listen to this.

1556
01:53:49.96 --> 01:53:52.96
Also with 100% certainty, you won't, you won't lack.

1557
01:53:52.96 --> 01:53:53.96
You won't slack.

1558
01:53:53.96 --> 01:53:56.96
Well, and there's also an awesome,

1559
01:53:56.96 --> 01:53:59.96
a young girl on Twitter, what someone's daughter.

1560
01:53:59.96 --> 01:54:04.96
And she's saying she's saying sugar coated.

1561
01:54:04.96 --> 01:54:06.96
Those donuts are sugar coated.

1562
01:54:06.96 --> 01:54:09.96
I actually got fired up.

1563
01:54:09.96 --> 01:54:11.96
I'm not going to do donut ever again.

1564
01:54:11.96 --> 01:54:12.96
I retweeted it.

1565
01:54:12.96 --> 01:54:13.96
It's awesome.

1566
01:54:13.96 --> 01:54:14.96
That was classic.

1567
01:54:14.96 --> 01:54:17.96
And you can get it on iTunes,

1568
01:54:17.96 --> 01:54:23.96
but you can also get it on Amazon.com or like Amazon music.

1569
01:54:23.96 --> 01:54:24.96
It's I saw on Amazon.

1570
01:54:24.96 --> 01:54:25.96
Oh, it's on there.

1571
01:54:25.96 --> 01:54:26.96
Okay.

1572
01:54:26.96 --> 01:54:26.96
Yes.

1573
01:54:26.96 --> 01:54:27.96
You don't know.

1574
01:54:27.96 --> 01:54:28.96
Hold it.

1575
01:54:28.96 --> 01:54:29.96
Well, here's the thing.

1576
01:54:29.96 --> 01:54:31.96
The very,

1577
01:54:31.96 --> 01:54:33.96
Oh, should I say, very competent distributor.

1578
01:54:33.96 --> 01:54:34.96
We're working with.

1579
01:54:34.96 --> 01:54:35.96
Oh, they distribute it.

1580
01:54:35.96 --> 01:54:37.96
I did choose all these things.

1581
01:54:37.96 --> 01:54:41.96
And I forgot that I went through that process already.

1582
01:54:41.96 --> 01:54:43.96
Because I was so focused on like iTunes or whatever.

1583
01:54:43.96 --> 01:54:47.96
And yes, so I ended the fact is I ended up going through that process.

1584
01:54:47.96 --> 01:54:49.96
And it did get distributed through there.

1585
01:54:49.96 --> 01:54:51.96
But since I don't use, I mean, I use it.

1586
01:54:51.96 --> 01:54:53.96
I'm a music, but I just seems like the obvious one.

1587
01:54:53.96 --> 01:54:54.96
I just didn't think about it.

1588
01:54:54.96 --> 01:54:57.96
Yeah, well, what's cool about Amazon is it puts when you,

1589
01:54:57.96 --> 01:54:58.96
if you look at.

1590
01:54:58.96 --> 01:55:02.96
Look at.

1591
01:55:02.96 --> 01:55:03.96
Jocquawaiti.

1592
01:55:03.96 --> 01:55:05.96
It'll say extreme ownership.

1593
01:55:05.96 --> 01:55:08.96
It'll say way of the war your kid.

1594
01:55:08.96 --> 01:55:10.96
And it'll say psychological warfare.

1595
01:55:10.96 --> 01:55:11.96
All right there from Amazon.

1596
01:55:11.96 --> 01:55:12.96
That's pretty awesome.

1597
01:55:12.96 --> 01:55:13.96
Boom.

1598
01:55:13.96 --> 01:55:15.96
Do I they understand your desires?

1599
01:55:15.96 --> 01:55:17.96
Because there's no way you can resist that one.

1600
01:55:17.96 --> 01:55:18.96
No, but it's right there.

1601
01:55:18.96 --> 01:55:19.96
You like, hey, this is awesome.

1602
01:55:19.96 --> 01:55:23.96
I'm going to get the the the the the the the grand slam.

1603
01:55:23.96 --> 01:55:25.96
Order them all.

1604
01:55:25.96 --> 01:55:33.96
And yeah, also yeah, so speaking of that, you can get the jockel light to you've had it by now.

1605
01:55:33.96 --> 01:55:35.96
And you know the deal.

1606
01:55:35.96 --> 01:55:40.96
You know that you're you know that you're clean and jerk is just out of control.

1607
01:55:40.96 --> 01:55:42.96
Your film that thing through the roof.

1608
01:55:42.96 --> 01:55:46.96
Also for international orders, by the way.

1609
01:55:46.96 --> 01:55:50.96
I hate to do this because it's going to put some work on the

1610
01:55:50.96 --> 01:55:55.96
resource income that's doing this for but if you go international go through eBay.

1611
01:55:55.96 --> 01:55:58.96
There's an official listing of jockel podcast.

1612
01:55:58.96 --> 01:56:05.96
You'll see that it sold by pro resource and they also it says the shipping is a hundred dollars.

1613
01:56:05.96 --> 01:56:07.96
That's not the shipping.

1614
01:56:07.96 --> 01:56:08.96
There's like very aid and shipping.

1615
01:56:08.96 --> 01:56:10.96
So they just kind of quote that price.

1616
01:56:10.96 --> 01:56:11.96
But then I think they figured out later.

1617
01:56:11.96 --> 01:56:13.96
So they don't have to ask me about that.

1618
01:56:13.96 --> 01:56:18.96
But yeah, we're trying to get it to people overseas.

1619
01:56:18.96 --> 01:56:21.96
I'm not saying it's going to not sell out quickly.

1620
01:56:21.96 --> 01:56:24.96
But it's there.

1621
01:56:24.96 --> 01:56:32.96
If also if you if you like when we talk about war or leadership on this podcast,

1622
01:56:32.96 --> 01:56:35.96
you can pick up the book, extreme ownership.

1623
01:56:35.96 --> 01:56:39.96
Right myself and my brother, the lay back and babbin wrote it.

1624
01:56:39.96 --> 01:56:43.96
And that's what we talk about leadership and war.

1625
01:56:43.96 --> 01:56:47.96
And like I said earlier, go ahead and get some copies.

1626
01:56:47.96 --> 01:56:52.96
And then you can get some copies of the way the warrior kid.

1627
01:56:52.96 --> 01:56:55.96
You're going to dig it.

1628
01:56:55.96 --> 01:56:57.96
Extreme ownership,

1629
01:56:57.96 --> 01:57:01.96
Master is happening May 4th and 5th at the Marriott Marquis New York City.

1630
01:57:01.96 --> 01:57:03.96
It's a conference for people that want to get after it.

1631
01:57:03.96 --> 01:57:05.96
That's what it is.

1632
01:57:05.96 --> 01:57:09.96
Leadership on the battlefield in business and in life.

1633
01:57:09.96 --> 01:57:10.96
Why do I say battlefield?

1634
01:57:10.96 --> 01:57:13.96
Well, first of all, because we have military people that will be there.

1635
01:57:13.96 --> 01:57:15.96
We have police officers that will be there.

1636
01:57:15.96 --> 01:57:18.96
Right business obviously we have business people firefighters.

1637
01:57:18.96 --> 01:57:21.96
They're there battle with fire, but it's a lot of it.

1638
01:57:21.96 --> 01:57:24.96
Majority of its business people that want to get after it.

1639
01:57:24.96 --> 01:57:29.96
And it's also people that want to get after it and lead in life.

1640
01:57:29.96 --> 01:57:31.96
It's going to sell out.

1641
01:57:31.96 --> 01:57:37.96
We have a if echo finally quality not quantity.

1642
01:57:37.96 --> 01:57:43.96
Finally a great video executed later is better than a good video executed now.

1643
01:57:43.96 --> 01:57:47.96
You'll probably probably have a video up pretty soon.

1644
01:57:47.96 --> 01:57:55.96
And until then, until the master, if you do want to cruise with us,

Guys like Army Vet James Kenny.

1654
01:58:45.96 --> 01:58:47.96
You know what, 64 years old?

1655
01:58:47.96 --> 01:58:49.96
No factor.

1656
01:58:49.96 --> 01:58:50.96
Surgery, no factor.

1657
01:58:50.96 --> 01:58:54.96
Torne muscles, no factor.

1658
01:58:54.96 --> 01:58:58.96
Three hour or something commuted to the gym to train you get to.

1659
01:58:58.96 --> 01:59:00.96
No factor.

1660
01:59:00.96 --> 01:59:05.96
Intrinsic will and discipline big factor.

1661
01:59:05.96 --> 01:59:12.96
Because James 64 years old just got his blue belt.

1662
01:59:12.96 --> 01:59:18.96
Congratulations James and I know a ton of you are out there doing the same thing.

1663
01:59:18.96 --> 01:59:25.96
Military members out on the battlefield police officers on the beat, firefighters on the scene.

1664
01:59:25.96 --> 01:59:31.96
You're doing the same thing smashing obstacles.

1665
01:59:31.96 --> 01:59:41.96
And the rest of you in the workforce working, grinding through the day and the night.

1666
01:59:41.96 --> 01:59:51.96
To get your work done and still getting after the workouts and the family events and the jutsu classes.

1667
01:59:51.96 --> 01:59:56.96
Thank you for what you are doing.

1668
01:59:56.96 --> 02:00:06.96
For realizing that if you have the will and the discipline, the obstacles you face are no factor.

1669
02:00:06.96 --> 02:00:14.96
And they cannot stop you from getting after it.

1670
02:00:14.96 --> 02:00:21.96
So until next time this is echo and juggle.

1671
