00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000 This is Jockel Podcast number 22 with echo Charles and me, Jockel Willink. Good evening, echo. Good evening.
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000 Someone called for my Afghan interpreter, Rockman. A good man with whom we had worked with for some time.
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000 These interpreters are the unsung heroes of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000 They often suffer threats and ostracism for their willingness to endure the battlefield alongside us.
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000 Their motivation isn't money. There's enough money to make it worthwhile facing down in surgeons who know where you and your family live.
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000 They are idealists. They work and risk death because they believe in our common cause of freedom.
00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:01.000 Rockman responded to the call immediately. Running before me, his foot fell in a particular spot just to feet away from where I stood.
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000 I was looking right at him.
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.000 As I later discovered, he instantly lost all his limbs in the explosion.
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:24.000 Even though I was staring right at him, I never actually saw it happen. My experience was a series of tremendous blows and subsequent realizations.
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000 A train hit me. Ears ringing. What the fuck was that?
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000 Darkness. Something is wrong. Got hit. My legs reached out and see if they're still there. They're there. I feel them.
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000 I'm saying everywhere. Mostly my abdomen. Something shot through it. I think my eyes must be kicked with mud. I can barely see anything.
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000 I hear groaning and screaming. Someone hit an IED. Pain everywhere. But my eyes.
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000 I crawl around a little bit. Mostly to see if my body still functions. My teammates make their way to me.
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000 I ask someone to pour water on my eyes to remove the dirt so I can see that doesn't work.
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:23.000 I can only see light and some shapes must be a lot of dirt. I recognize my corpsman's voice as he works on my wounds.
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:34.000 I say, dude, don't get blown up. It sucks. He laughs and tells me to shut up.
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.000 I was conscious throughout. Our corpsman stopped my bleeding. The worst of which was from my knees and wrapped up my eyes.
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000 It still did not occur to me that there was anything wrong with them. I could only hear the situation around me.
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000 My teammates calling to each other, communicating the situation with tense voices.
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:05.000 I later found out that a foot wearing the typical Solomon boot that we all wore hit one of my teammates in the chest about 50 yards away.
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000 Rockman was groaning in pain. Deep, deep pain.
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:25.000 Most people's experience of combat wounds is from the movies. The soldier gets hit. His gut spilling out and he looks down at them screaming in horror.
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.000 But this is not the way it is. In reality, truly bad injuries, sap your energy and prevent you from screaming.
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.000 Instead, the sound of wounded man makes is a much deeper, more visceral emanating from the depths of his being.
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000 It's a grown, a cry, a moaning that wreaks of utter desperation.
00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:01.000 It is far worse than a scream. It is true pain manifested in the sound.
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.000 This was the sound that Rockman made. It is unforgettable.
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000 As the corn intended to me and we waited for the MetaVac helicopter, a fought entered my head.
00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000 We may be in a firefight any second now. Rockman was barely alive and he would later die in the hospital.
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000 Our EOD chief petty officer took a little frag also and would be evacuated with us. All hands were needed to fight.
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000 I could hear the MetaVac helo coming in low. This was no time to ask someone to carry me.
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000 Blow up and blind. I stood up and walked myself to it.
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000 Dave Worson, who would be killed two months later, heroically laid down cover fire for me as I boarded the helo.
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000 It was my last memory of him.
00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:01.000 MetaVac's on board the helo copter took one look at me, laid me down and eased me into unconsciousness.
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:11.000 I woke up days later, far away from Hellman, far away from Candeharr, far away from my brothers and arms, far away from the war and dust of Central Asia.
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000 I was brought back into consciousness in Germany at the American Hospital Longstool.
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:27.000 A breathing tube was being unceremoniously ripped from my throat, rather unpleasant.
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000 I opened my eyes or thought I did and saw nothing.
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000 A physician came to me and told me the truth. My right eye was gone.
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000 My left eye was so heavily damaged that there was virtually no chance I would see with it again.
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:59.000 My future was a future of blindness, of darkness, of no sight, no color, no visual beauty.
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000 I would never see a sunset, a friend, a loved one again.
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:23.000 In one instant, in a fatal footfall, all that was ripped away.
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:35.000 And that right there was an excerpt from a book called Fortitude, written by Dan Krenchall,
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:44.000 who was a former seal officer and he's actually been on this podcast before number 118.
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.000 And the last time he was on, he was in the process of running for Congress.
00:06:52.000 --> 00:07:01.000 Well, he won and is currently a congressman serving the second congressional district of Texas,
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.000 and the House of Representatives, and well, it's an honor to have Dan back with us today
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000 to share some of the lessons learned that he talks about in his new book.
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000 And once again, the name of the book is Fortitude. Dan.
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000 Thanks for coming back, Dan.
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000 Thank you for having me.
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000 Listen to you read that.
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000 Maybe I should have asked you to read my book for the audio version.
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000 That was good.
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000 Well, thanks.
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.000 It's only good because the story that's being told is obviously a very powerful one.
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000 And you know, you sent me this book.
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000 And as soon as you sent it to me, I started talking to you about, let's get you back on the podcast.
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000 Obviously you're busy man.
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000 Obviously you're busy man right now for reference.
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000 It is, what is it?
00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000 It's March of 2020 in the midst of the pandemic.
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000 The coronavirus pandemic is going on around the world and around America.
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000 There's schools and again, who knows what this will look like,
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000 looking back on it when people are listening to this in the future.
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000 Whether if they're listening to it a month from now, a week from now or years from now,
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000 it'll be interesting what this pandemic turned out to be.
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000 But you braved the travel.
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000 We did.
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.000 We did.
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000 And we just, you know, I'm leaving off the heels of that late night vote again for,
00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000 for listeners trying to put this in context and what you saw in the news.
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000 Leaving off the heels of that late night vote where,
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000 where, which was for the economic stimulus that the president supported
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000 and bipartisan in nature, different from the eight billion plus dollars that we voted on a week prior,
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000 which was meant to combat it on a public health scale.
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000 So, you know, I, I, the, it's,
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000 everybody agrees.
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000 I think we've, as a country and as a government, we have taken this particular pandemic more seriously than anything in the past.
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000 More than we did for Ebola, for H1N1.
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000 And I've asked that specific questions to folks like the Assistant Surgeon General Admiral Red,
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000 who, who, who, who worked all of these pandemics.
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000 And so, I just hope people realize that that's not what you hear from the media.
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000 You know, the media would tell you that it's totally unprepared.
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000 And, you know, you're never going to be perfectly prepared.
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000 I think that's a lesson, you and I know pretty well.
00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000 But you learn those lessons and you do better the next time.
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:44.000 The finger pointing has been completely unnecessary, mostly dishonest and totally unhelpful.
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000 But the government has been taken it pretty seriously and we're definitely taking it seriously in Congress.
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000 Well, I'm glad you were able to get out here.
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:58.000 And again, I think there's no telling what this will look like in hindsight.
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000 But it's quiet around here in San Diego right now.
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000 There's just not a lot of people doing a lot of stuff. Obviously we're in the gym and the gym,
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000 you know, not a lot of ton of people coming into the gym right now.
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000 There's still people training though.
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000 Don't worry, we're training that you did, too.
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:24.000 But yeah, you sent me the book and, you know, cracked it open, started reading it and immediately was just, you know, getting in touch with you to see if we could get you out here.
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:34.000 On the podcast to talk about it and man, you know, the stuff that you've been through and the lessons that you've taken away from it are very powerful.
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:48.000 And you know, that's one of the things that struck me out of the gate is that when you got wounded, you actually, you actually do strength from very powerful place and things that you've been through.
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:56.000 And I want to jump in and read some more of this, some more of this things that you've been through.
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000 And I think a lot of people are going to be able to take a lot of away from it.
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000 So I'm going back to the book.
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000 This is after you wounded.
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000 I fought back to another time in my life two decades earlier.
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:14.000 The first time I ever witnessed the kind of inescapable pain that I was feeling now and the grit to overcome it was with my mother.
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000 She fought a battle so many other modern women fight breast cancer.
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000 And she did so with endurance, grace and optimism.
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:34.000 Her example is never left me and it wasn't about to let some cheap ass ID in the ancient killing fields of Afghanistan render me unworthy of her memory.
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000 She was only 35 years old when she was diagnosed.
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000 Same age as me as I write these words.
00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000 When she got the news, it was one day before my little brothers first birthday.
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000 I was five years old.
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000 The doctors told her she might have five years to live.
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000 And they were right.
00:11:52.000 --> 00:12:00.000 Soon after she would be feeling the pain I was feeling now as the cancer and chemotherapy ripped apart her body in battle.
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000 She fought it for five years.
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000 And when I was 10, she died.
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:16.000 If you've ever cared for loved one in terminal decline, you know what that's like.
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000 There is an intensity of loss that is immeasurable.
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000 Words don't do it justice.
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000 The whole deep down in your gut feels like it will never go away.
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.000 As a child, the intensity of the experience is made worse as grief is amplified by in comprehension.
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000 Going from kindergarten to fourth grade, knowing that your mother is dying.
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000 That the center of a small boy's world is collapsing is an experience I wouldn't wish on anyone.
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000 But from this grief came learning.
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000 I got to experience the nature of a true hero.
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:56.000 And the example she set was the most powerful fortifying and selfless thing I have ever seen, including combat.
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:04.000 Buying helpless and a hospital bed, I had to wonder whether my mother had asked the same desperate question I was currently asking.
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000 What I ever seen, my family again.
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:15.000 I figured that as she could suffer through that question and the unknowable answer, so could I.
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:25.000 My mother spent half a decade staring death in the face, burned with caring for two small boys whom she would not live to see grow up.
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000 She lived day to day in ever increasing pain, the cancer afflicted her.
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000 And the cancer treatments afflicted her too.
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:42.000 Six rounds of chemotherapy on top of radiation treatments are a brutal experience for even the strongest constitution.
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000 Self pity is never a useful state.
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:53.000 But if anyone had reason to feel sorry for herself and had to complain a bit, it was my mom.
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000 But she never did.
00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000 In terminal decline and in pain across five years, I never heard her complain once.
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000 I never heard her bemoan her fate.
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000 I never saw her express self pity.
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.000 Every day she woke up was a day she was still alive and she lived.
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000 She was dying and she was grateful to not be dead yet.
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000 Every extra day was a gift where she could look her boys in the face.
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000 Every next evening was another night she could tell us she loved us before bed.
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000 Even during her last days when the hospital delivered her death bed and hospice nurse to our dining room.
00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000 Her demeanor did not change.
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:48.000 Susan Carroll Crenshaw was exactly the opposite of what she had every right to be.
00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000 She was a very good person.
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000 She was a very good person.
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000 Yeah, yeah, it was more for my mom than for me.
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.000 You know, I tell that story because the name of that chapter is perspective from darkness.
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:18.000 And perspective, I think is something we lack in our modern day society.
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:34.000 We are, I think, too many people are willing to jump to this false conclusion that you've had at the worst that your life is worse than your ancestors or than your peers or than anybody else walking around America right now.
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000 And there's just a really, just so happens, there's a really good chance that's not true.
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000 I'm not saying it's not true.
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000 I'm just saying there's a pretty good chance it's probably not true.
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000 It's interesting, too.
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000 Well, I always talk about perspective from a leadership perspective, which means, hey, if I'm looking at one of my troops,
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000 the better I understand their perspective on what I'm telling them and what their job is and what the mission is,
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000 the better I'm going to be able to lead them.
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000 And same thing with my boss.
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000 The better I understand my boss's perspective and what the strategy look like and what's the overall thing he's trying to get accomplished.
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000 The better I understand his perspective, the better I'm going to be able to lead.
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:26.000 And it's interesting because when you put that across society, you would think that in today's day and age with the, with social media, with the ability to absorb so many other people's perspectives,
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:36.000 you'd think that that would open up your mind to realize that there's, you know, a lot of other people that have been through much worse than anything.
00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000 I've even been close to gone through.
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000 Yeah.
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000 And yet it doesn't seem to be happening that way.
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000 No.
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000 One of the most popular stories for an American to hear is a story of overcoming adversity.
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000 And that's a good thing.
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000 I'm glad those are still the stories that are the most popular in the American psyche.
00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000 You know, that a movie about somebody who's down-trodden and overcomes it is still a good movie.
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.000 But there is, it's undeniable that there is this fragility that is infecting America.
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000 And that's why I wrote this book.
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000 And it's, you know, it's not a political book, it's not a seal book, it's not a, it's a cultural book.
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000 It's a cultural philosophy book and it's, it's simultaneously an individual kind of self-help book.
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000 And just how to be mentally tougher in your own individual life.
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000 But there are much broader cultural implications that are strewn throughout the book.
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000 It is a, it is a culture book.
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:42.000 And because I fear that we are getting more sensitive, more prone to microaggressions and prone to saying how offended you are and
00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000 wearing, wearing that offense on your sleeve, proudly.
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.000 And, and this gets to the, I think, what's the next chapter, which is who is your hero?
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000 And we've changed what we look up to.
00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000 Like we think that it's good to, to scream about how offended we are.
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000 Like that's become like a monochrome, a good thing.
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000 You know what's interesting, as, as, you know, before we start recording, you know,
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000 we're just talking about kind of life in the games.
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:23.000 And, uh, if there's one thing that you never do in the teams, ever, is show anyone that you're offended by anything that you're saying to you because if you allow that to happen,
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000 you know, you're just going to get torn apart.
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:37.000 Whereas it seems like, and I hadn't thought about from that perspective, the, the, all the rage in the public right now is if you can possibly get offended by something, then it's your, your, your, your,
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000 your the best thing in the world, if you jump up and down and point to the person that offended you and why you were offended and,
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000 and the more offended you are the better off.
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:56.000 The agree of a to victim status is supreme these days, and that's a, and that's more of a serious problem than then I think most Americans are giving it credit for it.
00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:07.000 It's a really bad thing because you're changing, you're changing our heroes and, and when I say heroes, I want to, I want to be more specific because then I outlined this in the book and greater detail.
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000 I don't mean like, Jaco is my hero.
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:18.000 Actually, and I personally when people ask me about who I look up to and my heroes, I, I will tell them attributes of people that I think are respectable.
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000 I don't think you should have one person that you look up to and I don't think that's totally healthy and that's not what I'm talking about on the book.
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000 I'm talking about hero archetypes.
00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:36.000 You know, and an archetype is a, is a, is a broader set of ideas or attributes that we sort of, that we sort of recognize collectively.
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000 Okay, so it's more of a psychological term than anything else.
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000 And there are certain hero archetypes, you know, like, maybe seals have a hero archetype.
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000 We write about that in our, in our seal ethos.
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:57.000 It's such a beautifully written ethos and I, and I, I have the entire thing written in the book because it perfectly demonstrates what we believe we should be.
00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:04.000 Now what we should do, but what we should be, and that's a really interesting thing, and I, and I, and I note that,
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000 you, you look at a, like, a corporate ethos, and if you go to people like corporations websites and you read them,
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000 they're, they're usually something like, we want to be the number one manufacturer on the West Coast.
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000 It's like, that's not who you want to be.
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000 That's just something you want to do.
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000 If you, if you write out an ethos of who you want to be, you can, you can reach that level of elitism.
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000 You can surpass mediocrity.
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:36.000 So that's important. That's important thing is here's that we have societal hero archetypes that we look up to.
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000 Jesus is a, is a hero archetype.
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000 Superman is a hero archetype.
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000 Real characters, too. You know, I put, I, I, I, I could name a thousand, you know, Rosa Parks, Ronald Reagan.
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000 All of these people embody certain attributes that the American people think this is good.
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000 Okay. And we did generally agree on these things.
00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000 I tell a whole story in the book about, when I was at Disney World, or was it Disney World?
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000 And I, I was at the Star Wars land.
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000 And I was watching this really cool thing happen where they, where they let these kids do Jedi training.
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000 Mm-hmm.
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000 And of course, like in, in typical Disney fashion, everything is really well run.
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000 The actors are absolutely amazing.
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:20.000 And they're teaching these kids, you know, how to work their swords and all that.
00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000 But they're also teaching them really cool things like the, just little Jedi lessons.
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000 Like, like, will you let your emotions be driven by hate and anger?
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000 You know, like really simple lessons, because we look up to the Jedi as like a hero archetype.
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000 And so there are certain things that are just viewed as good.
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000 But that's changing.
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000 And I, and I find that to be an extremely dangerous thing, because we're elevating the,
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000 the, a grieved victim, the person who talks about being offended the most and who screams the loudest,
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000 elevating that person to a higher level in our society.
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000 And that's dangerous.
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000 You're, you're flipping cultural norms on their head.
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:09.000 And you do that at your own peril, you know, and, you know, cultural foundations based in thousands of years of trial and error and wisdom.
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000 Those are important.
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000 They're more important than people realize.
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000 And like, that's, that's, that's frankly what the first,
00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000 I guess, with that, that particular chapter is about perspectives chapter.
00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000 You know, they're all related, of course.
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000 But the perspective's chapter and the reason I bring up my mom and the reason I tell that story.
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:36.000 And then subsequent stories of other guys that we've lost is because you, you,
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000 you need to, it's healthy to go through life thinking, you know, what somebody has had it harder than me.
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000 And I'd like to live up to their memory.
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000 I'd like to live up to that hero attribute, the hero, or the hero archetype of my mother.
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000 And I'm not lying. She never complained. She just, she never did.
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000 And if she did, I didn't hear it as a kid.
00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000 And so, when you're living in blindness and not sure whether you will see again,
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000 it's healthy to have that in your head.
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.000 And I'm, you know, I say, you don't have to, you don't have to experience a bomb in your face to get some perspective.
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:18.000 But you can read about it. And it's like you said earlier, in a world where we're so connected and we can see everybody else's story of hardship,
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000 you would think that we would have more perspective.
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000 But it seems that the opposite is true.
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000 And for, for step to reversing that trend, I think, is to at least realize it.
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000 Yeah, we, we recently had on, um,
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:47.000 rose-sindler who was, um, Auschwitz survivor. And I got many, many, many, um, messages and comments coming back saying, yeah, I'll put myself in check, you know, I, I don't have it that bad.
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000 Um, so that, and you know, we've had many people on here that have been through some really hellacious things,
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000 whether it's prison or war camps, some just devastating situations.
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:08.000 And it is, it's, it's, it's, it, if they weren't here and here, I, I get the feeling sometimes that if people weren't hearing it here, they wouldn't be hearing it.
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:17.000 They wouldn't be hearing it, you know, they'd just be thinking that everyone is living better than they are and they're the ones that are in the worst possible situation in the world.
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:27.000 We've got, yeah, and that's a, you know, I don't know, to, to get too much to politics, but it is, it is, it is one reason that we, that we have lurched into this conversation
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000 about socialism because fundamentally socialism is, is an ideology that pits people against each other.
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.000 You have to believe that somebody else is oppressing you and that they have a better than you for you to embrace socialism.
00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:47.000 It is, it is, it is, it is the ultimate sin manifested into a political ideology, not the ultimate sin, but it's one of them.
00:24:47.000 --> 00:25:04.000 And that's, I was, I was looking for the deeper reason as to why something is happening. And it is natural for, for people to want to believe that something outside their own power is affecting their lives.
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:12.000 Because if it's you, if it's your fault, if it's you who has to step up, that's harder, it's much easier to believe that there's something else.
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:19.000 It also isn't a salt on your ego when you look at yourself and you say, well, I guess I'm the one that messed this up.
00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000 Yeah, it is, and that's a devastating psychological consequence when your ego is hurt that way.
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000 It is.
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000 Yeah, I wrote a book about that called Extreme Ownership.
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000 Which is a good book.
00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:38.000 Again, it's, it's one of those things where, you know, you wrote this book as, you know, as you're saying like a cultural philosophy, you know,
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:49.000 like, life and I wrote Extreme Ownership as, oh, as leadership principles, but I mean it didn't take, but two seconds for everyone to say, oh yeah, what you're talking about is, you know,
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.000 easily transforms into a, into a cultural philosophy of taking ownership and responsibility for what's going on in your world.
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000 Absolutely, there's no doubt about it.
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000 And you find yourself in the lot in light and look, do people get cancer?
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000 Yes, people get cancer. Do, do horrible things happen to people to families? Yes, absolutely.
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000 How do you respond to those things? Is the question, how do you take ownership of what you do next?
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:24.000 And, and that's the, that's the big difference. And if what you do next is, is, you know, say it's out of my control and I can't do anything and you're, get the mentality that you're a victim of what's happening around you.
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000 That means you're not going to make any changes to transform your life and move in a more positive direction. It's just the way it is.
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000 And, you know, I think, I think one of these things that happens with,
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:43.000 you know, these ideas behind socialism in America and again, it's, it's like crazy that we would be sitting here talking about this, anybody that,
00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:52.000 anybody that reads anything about history knows that this is just not good, but, you know, it comes across always as,
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000 Hey, well, what we want to do is help everyone out. That's what we want to do. We want to help everyone out.
00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000 And, okay, if that's like the core belief and this is where I think sometimes we could do better or, you know,
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.000 someone like myself could do a better job explaining to people, look, if you care about other human beings,
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:21.000 so much, if you want to help as many people as possible in this country, the best possible thing you could do is allow the market to flourish,
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:31.000 allow people to build businesses. That's what you, that's what changes people's lives, that's what helps not giving them a handout and making them reliable or a lot,
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:38.000 or a reliant on the state. It doesn't help anybody. It helps them for a week. You know, it helps them for that pay period,
00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000 but it doesn't help them transform their lives into something more positive.
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:50.000 One way I explain that exact sentiment is to ask someone to imagine how they would raise their kid if they love their kid.
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.000 You know, would you give them whatever they want? Would you, would you tell your kid that whatever they do wrong?
00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000 It's not their fault. Somebody else made them do it wrong. Would you tell them that there's no consequences for their actions?
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:11.000 Would you tell them that if they do an hour of chores and they're sibling those three hours of chores that they deserve the same reward?
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000 Would you teach them any of these things? There is no liberal who would teach other kids these things? They don't.
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000 Because they love their kids and they want their kids to be successful.
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000 But that's effectively what we're teaching, what we're saying that we should teach our citizens.
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000 And so I ask people why don't we treat our citizens the way we treat our kids as if we loved them?
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000 Because that's true compassion. It doesn't mean we don't have a social safety net.
00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000 And that's always the counter argument. It's a disingenuous counter argument.
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000 Well, the counter argument that is look with your kids.
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:51.000 And this is an example that I use when I especially when I'm talking to businesses. So I say listen, like what will be with a startup, right? That's grown from you know, they were ten people.
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000 Then there are hundred people. Now they're getting to that threshold.
00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:01.000 And I say listen at some point, you're going to have to put some discipline on what's going on inside your company.
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000 You're going to have to have people come to work at a lined times.
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000 You're going to have to have them eat lunch at certain times.
00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:17.000 Right, not just one that you're going to have to have meetings that are scheduled. And look, when you've got a company of twelve people, you can get away with all that stuff.
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000 And it's great. There's money coming in and everything's.
00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000 But as soon as you start to grow, well, you have to start to have discipline inside your organization.
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:34.000 Right. And so the example I give people is I say listen, have you ever met a kid that when he's born, look, when a child is born, you give whatever they want.
00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:42.000 You've got to keep them alive, right? There's your social state like you have to give them food, water, milk. You have to get you have to feed them. You have to take care of them.
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000 If you continue to do that when they're three, four, five.
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:57.000 Well, by the time they're ten, you actually now have Satan for a child because this kid is totally out of control demanding.
00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:06.000 But doesn't know how to do anything for themselves. Can't make themselves a sandwich. Can't tie their own shoes. It can't do anything. So what you have to do is you have to let people, for themselves.
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:14.000 You have to let kids brush up against the guardrails of failure. You have to do that. And yes, you have to do that with society as well. In my opinion.
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:25.000 And that's what the thing, the argument that I don't hear back at people that are saying, hey, we should give everything away for free is listen.
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:42.000 We don't have enough to give away everything for free. The best way that you can take care of the most amount of people is to allow freedom, allow individual freedom, allow people to pursue goals, allow people to pursue business, allow people to grow things and hire people.
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.000 That's how we all win.
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:55.000 It's so it's crazy to me that we still have these discussions. And it's also, yeah, it's crazy to me that we're having these discussions right now.
00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:07.000 There's like this, just like this belief that they subscribe to, which is it only politicians want so mean and corrupt. You know, there's all these things hidden that we could just give you.
00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:36.000 And I'm just like, does that really sound right? Like this? It's just that really sound like that's that's correct. That was just all just extra money just hidden in the in the in the treasury that we could just give out, but we don't want to that everybody that we have all these luxury apartments that we could just give out, you know, because housing is a right or whatever or that or that there's just enough doctors and hospitals to take care of everyone and they're just kind of waiting around like not, you know, I mean like come on.
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:53.000 It's not, if it sounds too good to be true, it most certainly is. And again, it doesn't mean that we don't want to keep striving for a, you know, broader access to healthcare doesn't mean that we want to keep don't want to keep striving for a more efficient social safety net.
00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:08.000 Not saying that, but the, but the lurch to the, to the progressive left and socialism is it's it's based upon this idea that that we're keeping something from you know, and it's just not true.
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:24.000 Based on this idea too that that that we're going to want to go with this, it's it's it's kind of like a constant escalation of crisis and it's it's it's it's not surprising that we got there. Okay, and this is what I mean by that.
00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:39.000 The progressive you're generally wanting more well progress right change for the sake of change itself is often the case and you have to promise more things than you did last time, right because fundamentally it's it's it's based in the sense of compassion.
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:56.000 Giving people things from the government and we'll think very much they don't think much more about what that does the foundation of the creation that you talked about. It's just giving people more things and it's almost like they relied on conservatives for the last hundred years to at least to at least.
00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:09.000 Being obstacle to their to their worst instincts right because the conservatives are the ones who say okay hold on like it's think of the second third order consequences of that think of what that does to our foundations.
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:21.000 What I say foundations I mean foundations of a free market system that creates all this wealth in the first place like you can't you can't just you can't remove the legs of the stool if you want to improve the stool I get it let's work on that.
00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:33.000 But don't remove the legs of the stool it'll just fall same with our political foundations same with our cultural foundations is three groups that are very important we can I could go on for hours about this but.
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:47.000 But I'll try and stay on top on on on this line of thought here and so you promise more things and you promise more things and eventually you're like running out of things to promise and you got to meet bolder and bolder and bolder.
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:57.000 This is how you get socialism well intention liberalism always leads to socialism it takes years but it happens we're at that point now.
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:06.000 Okay, like the the the the well intention liberals maybe that the the smarter you know democrats that Republicans have often worked with.
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:17.000 I think always over promise but no full well that the Republican colleagues will sort of measure the policy and I don't think they believe it themselves frankly.
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000 But they've created a generation that does believe it.
00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:26.000 This is where we're at right now the aOCs of the world are true believers and they've got a lot of followers.
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:40.000 This is what happens when this this live compassion gets told too many times a generation starts to actually believe it and this is the situation where in now says why 70% of the millennials.
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:49.000 Survey will say they would vote for a socialist now there's good news and bad news associated with the number like that they don't always define socialism correctly which is good.
00:34:49.000 --> 00:35:00.000 And also I was having a conversation or something about this today I mean in 1968 how many 20 year olds would have said they would have voted for socialism it probably be a private 70% as well.
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:10.000 Yeah, you know there was a socialist candidate I can't remember the name right now but I just saw this quote and it was so interesting because that socialist communist candidate back then in the 60s.
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:25.000 Basically said what I just said you know you you've got to I can't remember the exact quote but it was something along the lines of the the elements of liberal policy are there to eventually create the fabric of socialism for us.
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:33.000 It's like it's it then that is exactly what happens it happens a little bit of a time and here here's another way of thinking about it that that help people understand.
00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:40.000 And then the minimum minimum wage okay and you want to raise it to 15 bucks an hour 20 bucks an hour.
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:47.000 And that's fine there's it's guaranteed that you will lose jobs when you do that that's it's guaranteed okay.
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:54.000 And so you lose jobs and depending on how much you raise it in the cost of living in that area you'll lose a certain number of jobs.
00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:03.000 Well the the well intention liberal and government who wants to control the economy says well we don't want to lose the jobs okay we'll just make people higher more.
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000 Just make make the employers higher more people okay fine so you make them higher more people but they still have to pay them in a one-way.
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:17.000 Well they're costs haven't changed and they're they're overall budget hasn't changed so so now what will then they have to raise prices right raise prices drastically.
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:27.000 Well now there's hyperinflation and now that's not good and also the poor people can't afford the things that they want to buy so that's not good okay we'll just make them lower the prices.
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000 What we're going out of business okay just take over the business so now you own the means of production.
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:41.000 And I'm not saying it happens that quickly but that's how it happens like there's there's there's a logical line there will that well intention for step of intervening in the markets.
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:57.000 And then you're going to have consequences and eventually if you want to control it you have to really control it and then you're in a really bad place because then you're then you're then you're actually controlling production and when you do that well then you're in a place called Venezuela yeah and that isn't turning out so well.
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000 All right little tangent right there.
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:13.000 It's actually I go into this huge discussion about the minimum wage in the book.
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:13.000 Not because it's actually relates to mental toughness because the way I relate it in the book is.
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:22.000 Part of being part of having fortitude part of being mentally tough is having the ability to think through some questions before you react emotionally.
00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:34.000 I'm pretty sure I think that example is used in the chapter called be still and I mean that quite literally just be still when you hear something that is emotionally triggering or you disagree with.
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000 Think about this notion that there might be another side to the story like just maybe if you just ask some questions.
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:50.000 And at first again the minimum wage it seems like the right thing to do like people should just get paid more I want them to get paid more they should.
00:37:50.000 --> 00:38:06.000 So I just give the arguments in there like there's economic arguments and there's geographical arguments by that I mean you know why would you have a federal minimum wage the same for the entire country when in San Francisco the the rent is $3,500 a month and in Lubbock Texas $700 a month.
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:15.000 You know does that that just that really quickly makes the case against a federal minimum wage not saying that each city can't do their own thing.
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:25.000 And then I go into the economic arguments of who's actually working a minimum wage jobs the the point isn't to make the argument against the minimum wage the point is to get you to understand that.
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000 This issue like many many other issues and questions has many many layers to it.
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:48.000 And if you stop and you think or at first assume those layers exist right the next step is look into the layers and there might be more to it and when you do that you are exhibiting mental strength you're exhibiting the ability to not react.
00:38:48.000 --> 00:39:00.000 But to just ask questions like I have a feeling just a feeling that the people really angrily waving those 15 dollar minimum wage signs have not looked into the arguments.
00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000 It's yeah, but they're passionate.
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000 Yes, really you know it.
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000 Yeah, at our factory up in Maine.
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:18.000 Yes, this is a classic thing like sometimes you need more people to load boxes and who do you get who do you get to load boxes is an unskilled job like hey we just need you to move.
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:29.000 And so I'm not even loading by it's moving boxes from here in the warehouse to where they're going to get loaded on trucks to get to shipped out you know you know who wants that job a kid that's a.
00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:38.000 16 years old that you know that needs gas money and he's going to work that job two hours a night whatever and make a little bit of cash on the side.
00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000 That's cool we get a for to do that at the at our business.
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000 The minute you say hey instead of paying that guy 10 bucks now you got to give him $16 now or well now it's guess what we're going to take.
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:55.000 We're going to just take some of our other labor and have them fill in you know half an hour or half an hour there and all of a sudden you've eliminated three jobs.
00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:02.000 The overall budget of the business does not change just because you change the minimum wage, but there's this like belief and again you know it's.
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:17.000 I'm always amazed by how little pockets put into some of these you know feel good policy policy proposals like as if there's no second third order consequences to these things and like you just you have to think through that.
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000 You just have to that would be nice.
00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000 All right.
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000 Let's get back to the book.
00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000 I'm going to take you back to the book you just you just debrief the entire book we can just say and now.
00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000 All right so here we go.
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000 Uh, awake now and long stool. I could not move.
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000 I was beaten and for the moment physically broken.
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000 I was riddled with shards and debris under under the skin and deep within.
00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000 I was swollen badly suffering from a thousand small cuts everything burned and itched.
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000 They'll oddly enough.
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000 I don't recall any pain in my eyes.
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000 I said before that I woke up unable to see, but this was not entirely true.
00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000 I could see I could not see my surroundings true, but I was certainly seeing.
00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000 I was surrounded by constant hallucinations.
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000 The result of my optic nerve still communicating erratically with my brain.
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000 The hallucinations were lucid and all followed a pattern.
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000 I was an Afghanistan. I was with the guys.
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000 I was in an Afghan village mud walls and compounds.
00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000 There was an Afghan man sitting next to me.
00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000 There were piles of weapons in the corner.
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000 I lived my previous experiences.
00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000 I lived my previous experiences over and over again.
00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000 I knew it wasn't real. I was hallucinating, but not delusional.
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000 If I was awake, I was seeing these images.
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000 If I was lucky enough to fall asleep and dream, never more than 30 minutes,
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000 then I would wake up and still wake up still inside the visual reality of the dream.
00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000 That sounds insane.
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000 That was, that was insane.
00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000 Now, was some of that drugs were you on? Were you on any drugs that were given you hallucinations?
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000 No.
00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000 This was just all your optic nerve communicating.
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000 There's some research this later in life.
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000 There's some history of this happening to people who go suddenly blind
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000 that that optic nerve will continue to do that.
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000 It couldn't have been drugs.
00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.000 The only drugs I was on were painkillers and that wouldn't have that effect.
00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000 It was just some weird things.
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000 It was so weird.
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000 It kind of terrifying.
00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000 It amplified the whole experience.
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000 Because I knew it wasn't real.
00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000 I knew it wasn't real.
00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000 I would always see them there.
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000 I would talk about them.
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000 The stranger's stories are from my friends.
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000 There's a couple of seals who came to me with Lance to Lance's tool.
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:50.000 It was such a enormous blessing. You can't even describe how important it is for somebody
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000 in that state to just have somebody they know.
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000 Or at least somebody they kind of trust.
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000 It doesn't even have to be a team guy you know.
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000 It could just be somebody who understands you.
00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000 Just there.
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000 I remember this old Afghan man sitting next to me.
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000 It was always like a weird blue light.
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000 It really was like a dream out of the movies.
00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000 Where like a face would be kind of melting.
00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000 I just remember that very specifically.
00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000 I don't remember all the hallucinations.
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000 But I always remember piles of weapons.
00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000 It was really like we were.
00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000 It was remembering the moments which were so many because we would always do two to three
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000 day ops on that particular deployment.
00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000 And so we'd hold up in some compound.
00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000 And it was you know it's like all the guys are just in this tiny little room together.
00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000 Shoot the shit and our weapons are kind of strewn throughout.
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000 And that's what I would see.
00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000 I would just see that experience all the time.
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000 And the mud walls and one particularly weird dream.
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000 And I think I do describe this in the book.
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000 It's I was like I was in a third world country.
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000 And like in a department store.
00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000 You know like going through a very crowded department store.
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:04.000 Not with people but with clothes.
00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000 Like they're like they you know because in like a lot of these countries.
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000 They just it's not like Walmart.
00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000 You know where you can comfortably walk through things like they pack too much stuff in.
00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000 Because they don't have that much space.
00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000 But they got a lot of stuff and they pack it in there.
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000 And I'm just like trying to move through these clothes and it's like musty and the lights are fluorescent.
00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000 Like again like this is just a very terrible country kind of scene.
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000 You know I couldn't say where it was but I've been to a lot of terrible countries.
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000 So my mind is used to this sort of visualization.
00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000 And then I woke up and I know I'm awake but I'm still there.
00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000 And that's what really sucked to not be able to leave the nightmare.
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000 Like I was literally living in a nightmare.
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000 And we always used the word literally wrong in our modern day society.
00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000 I'm not using it wrong.
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000 I was literally living in the nightmare.
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000 And like it was in a scapeble.
00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000 And that that's what sucked because like you just couldn't you couldn't shake it.
00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000 And that's that's a there's just a horrible place to be.
00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:10.000 And finally went away when a nurse and a student nurse and a observant nurse just realized what was going on.
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000 And she started asking us about it.
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000 And my wife is just like kind of exasperated at this point.
00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000 She wasn't my wife then but she was a fiance then.
00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000 And she was just you know exhausted and like just trying to deal with this.
00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:30.000 And I think it was like I think it was like right after my first surgery or maybe right before I don't remember.
00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000 But she was just like how long has this been going on.
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.000 And we're like the whole time.
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000 Like ever since I woke up.
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000 You know, so days and maybe a week I'm not really sure.
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000 And she's like that's not good.
00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000 She should.
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000 I mean her response was like you will have a reprobable PTSD if this continues.
00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000 You know, because like you just living in a nightmare is not a great place.
00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:03.000 It's just and and so she shot me up with a bunch of adivine which was like it's a hard anti anxiety drug.
00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000 And then then it got really weird.
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000 Then the hallucinations change.
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000 They didn't go away right away.
00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000 They changed to Christmas.
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:17.000 So I was like in a I was like in a like a like a root off the red nose reindeer Christmas world.
00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000 This is what you're seeing.
00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000 Yeah, even though you can't see anything.
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000 This is what you see.
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000 Yeah, it's very Christmas world.
00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000 It's very vivid.
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000 It's not like when you close your eyes and imagine things.
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000 It's like it was vivid.
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000 The Christmas world was cool.
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000 Like that was that's cool.
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000 Yeah.
00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000 It was more relaxing.
00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000 It was like it was happier.
00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000 And then it went black.
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000 And then black black was the best.
00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000 That was that was good.
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000 It was like you would never think that you'd be happy to be blind.
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000 But like that was that was a good.
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000 It was necessary.
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:56.000 I could finally take a nap going back to the book here.
00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000 Tara.
00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000 This was your fiance at the time.
00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000 Tara was there when I finally arrived in Bethesda and never left my side from that moment on.
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000 Most of my family came up to see me as did many friends.
00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000 They were far more worried than I was and their spirits were low.
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:17.000 This was most likely due to the fact that they were mentally coherent enough to sense the pessimistic
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000 expectations of my surgeons.
00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000 The doctors did not think I would see again.
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000 They said so many times and I simply didn't believe them.
00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:32.000 My optimism, my self deception and my belief that the coming surgery on my left eye would work
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000 and that I would see was nothing less than a delusional gift that allowed me to keep my sanity.
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000 But I am not one for over expressions of faith.
00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000 I will say this.
00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000 I genuinely believe.
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000 God's strength was working through me then.
00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000 He was allowing me to believe something impossible.
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000 I prayed and my family prayed and we believed.
00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.000 We believed that the military surgeons would pick through a pierced and shrapnel ridden eye.
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000 Remove the most miniscule shards in debris.
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000 And then restore my sight.
00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000 We did not have good reason to believe it.
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000 But we did.
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:18.000 It is interesting that you call this self deception and delusional.
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000 It sounds like everyone else was just like, hey man, you know, isn't it going to work?
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000 Yeah, it was really stopped saying.
00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000 It was like, that's exactly right.
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000 It was a necessary self delusion.
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000 And again, I was like, I don't know why that was.
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000 And that's why I say it could have been God.
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000 God saying, you know, I can't.
00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000 I'm not going to save your eye for you, but learn real-anseurgence to do that.
00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000 But I will at least allow you to believe that it's possible because otherwise you're going to go nuts.
00:48:50.000 --> 00:49:00.000 And again, it's, I think my, you know, whatever you want to call it, post-traumatic growth afterwards is a function of being able to,
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.000 to live through the experience a certain way.
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000 Because it's terrifying to think that you might not see again.
00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000 That's terrifying.
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000 And I, and I, and I'm again, because that, that chapter is called perspective from darkness.
00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000 There are other veterans who immediately lost both eyes.
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000 They had no chance of seeing again.
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000 That's hardship.
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000 And I didn't have to deal with that, you know,
00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000 if somebody else has had it worse than you.
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000 I always remember that, even when you get blown up in the face.
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000 But yeah, the doctors and that, that continued.
00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000 It wasn't just being able to see anything again.
00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000 It was being able to see well again.
00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000 I was demanding, I was demanding the first surgery.
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000 So the first surgery for my left eye.
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000 Because my right eye's gone.
00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000 All right.
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000 I was gone in candle-hard.
00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000 They have it to be an off-the-mologist there that,
00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000 that, that, that new created the eye right away.
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.000 They do that early on so that your body will focus on the, the eye that's, you know, possibly
00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000 savable.
00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000 But the right eye was so screwed up.
00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000 I wish that picture stuff it.
00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000 And that's kind of gruesome.
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000 You know, people don't want to take pictures of you in that.
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000 Because they're like, oh, that's not good to take pictures of you.
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:13.000 But, you know, keep in mind that the person might want those pictures later on.
00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000 That's, you know, people don't realize.
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.000 They had cursed the end of song.
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000 And she got, you know, she got in a Heal of Crash and Afghanistan.
00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000 And, you know, she's a beautiful girl.
00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000 And she had pictures of her face where 50 cow, like the way that he low went down.
00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000 I mean, it, it did some massive damage to her face.
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000 And she has pictures of it.
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000 And you look at the pictures and you can't believe that, you know, she was able to recover
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000 of the way she did.
00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.000 Yeah.
00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000 It's amazing.
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000 But, you know, she's a Marine.
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000 And I will say that she's much aligned with your feelings on this.
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000 I think she's pretty stoked that she has those pictures.
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000 And for example, fall jack to her.
00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000 You know, I'll tell you.
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000 You know, I'll tell you, you know, those pictures, was it the kind like, oh, after they got into like the medical,
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000 you know what?
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:05.000 Actually, I think it was, I think it was, if you remember her story, there was some really good plastic surgeon, like a,
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000 Right.
00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000 The least surgeon, female plastic surgeon that I think was probably like, oh, I'm in document this.
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.000 Yeah, see.
00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:19.000 So there's a difference between that and then like, someone being like, a weight guys and bust up the phone and start taking pictures, like, which is what you think a team guy would do.
00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000 And it would obviously go, oh, cool check out dance, other eye.
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000 I'm going to get some snaps of this.
00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000 And we got some, you know, so I've only got one picture, but it's a good week out.
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000 I mean, it's not, it's at least a few days.
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:35.000 Like it's, there's some healing that has taken place.
00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000 But I look, I look bad.
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000 Like it looks like a shock.
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000 I look like I had hit in the face with a shotgun.
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.000 That's what my face looks like.
00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000 I get show it to you right now.
00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000 If you really want to see it, just so you can react to it on the, but it's a little bit of, let's see.
00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000 But I've never posted it because it's a little, it's a little too gruesome for posting.
00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000 You're a blur it out.
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000 But, um, get the option.
00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:00.000 But, uh, yeah, the, um,
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000 Well, not kind of lost my chance.
00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.000 Where, where, where we are.
00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000 So you get that, you get the surgery.
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000 And the book, you talk about, they, they removed, um, the broken lens.
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.000 Yeah.
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000 Some copper wire that was in there.
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:12.000 Right.
00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000 A bunch of other debris.
00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000 So hallucination stop.
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000 And then, then you're six weeks.
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.000 They got to put you in a position for six weeks to recover.
00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000 Right.
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000 Um, so there's a couple things that happened here.
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000 That's the picture.
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000 Oh, that's a, that's about a week after.
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.000 So there's, there's some healing there, but that's not looking great.
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000 Yeah, that's rough.
00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000 So, yeah, right, I,
00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:51.000 Yeah, right, I's gone. Left eye has a, has a cataract, um, meaning the lens, which is in the middle of your eye is, uh, is destroyed.
00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.000 Cataracts are pretty normal thing for older folks to get, you know, just basically means the lens has kind of,
00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000 I don't know, the right term is, but it kind of clouds over.
00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000 You need to replace it.
00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000 Um, in my case, it was trauma induced.
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000 So it's much, much of fragments burst through the eye and, and destroyed the lens.
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000 You can kind of look at a lens like a window.
00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000 All right.
00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000 And this is an important way of thinking about it.
00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000 Because if it clouds over, if that window is just, you can't see through it anymore,
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000 we'll just replace the window pane.
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:22.000 But if the blast destroys the window, then you're trying to sew a new window pane onto basically the curtains,
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:24.000 which are like the scolaryl of your eye.
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000 And that was sort of the, the situation I was dealing with.
00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000 So the first miracle was they removed the lens entirely.
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000 So, okay, so that things out.
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:34.000 Because I remember this, I think, I think it was in landstroll.
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000 I sort of remember them shining a really bright light.
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000 My eye just to see if I could see light.
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:44.000 And I could see some light. When they did that, what I saw was like darkness.
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000 But there was like a light.
00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000 And it was like, we're in this room right now.
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.000 And there's this bright light.
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000 But of our heads is kind of like that.
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000 But everything else was like a cloud.
00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:57.000 Like being like on an air, like, if imagine you're like going through a cumulus cloud as you're taking off.
00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000 Like that's what it looks like.
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000 Very odd and strange.
00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000 And um, again, so the first miracle, this, and then,
00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000 maybe a week later when I finally got back to the Thursday, and we did the surgery,
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000 they removed the big copper wire that would really been destroying my eye.
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000 So that's good.
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000 And so we kind of start to see some blurring this after that.
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000 You know, which is kind of what I see now.
00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000 As I look at you now, I'm wearing a contact.
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.000 And with that, if I took this contact out, I wouldn't recognize you.
00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000 I wouldn't, I wouldn't know.
00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000 I wouldn't run into things necessarily, but I can't see anything.
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000 Um, you know, it's, it's, it's, I mean, I,
00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000 it's like, you know, 21,000 vision.
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000 It's like, I can't really see anything.
00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000 It's just, it's just blurry.
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000 Can't see close, can't see far.
00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000 Can't find my glasses if I lose them.
00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000 The glasses I do have are like that thick.
00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000 So I wear it night.
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000 Um, we're on airplanes or, you know,
00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000 Final feel like wearing a contact.
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000 So that never goes away.
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.000 But at the time, I wanted it to go away.
00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000 Like I wanted to be like, no, just make the eye better.
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000 I can't, you just do that.
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000 Because I got, I got places to be, okay?
00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.000 And they're like, yeah, do you?
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000 You know, I was like, I was like, yeah, I mean, I was like, okay.
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000 So you just did this surgery.
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000 We were moving to the cataract.
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000 Now, I want to new lens.
00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000 So that I don't have to wear, like, contacts and glasses.
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000 Because I don't look cool in these glasses, right?
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.000 I'm not a fan.
00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:25.000 And, you know, I don't really have the contact situation yet.
00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000 And then, and I actually wouldn't for two and a half years.
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000 It would take to get a really good contact.
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000 That's actually comfortable.
00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000 And so I was like, just do the surgery.
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000 And they're like, well, I don't know, they're like, we really shouldn't.
00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000 And I was like, okay, what's the, how much do we have to wait to do the surgery?
00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000 You know, what's the, what's the minimum time?
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000 Because I need to have it as soon as possible.
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000 Because, you know, I got to get back to the Bluetooth.
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:47.000 And I've got to go back.
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:51.000 And they're like, well, I mean, I guess technically six weeks.
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000 I'm like six weeks, it is.
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000 And I couldn't see them at the time.
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000 But they're looking at each other like, what the hell are you talking about?
00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.000 Like, this isn't, you don't understand what your situation is.
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000 Like, they were just, I mean, and my wife tells me all this now.
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000 Because I couldn't see them.
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000 And I couldn't, I wasn't self aware enough to gauge people's reactions.
00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.000 I was in totally different state of mind.
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000 I was on a lot of bank killers and drugs.
00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:18.000 And so, you know, and just like, full on seal mode.
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000 Like, get the job done.
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000 You must get back to Bluetooth and kill bad guys.
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000 And it's just like, wasn't making sense to people.
00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000 Like, they were just like, I don't know what's wrong with this guy.
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000 And so they just kind of humored me, I think.
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000 Like, they were just like, yeah, sure.
00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000 And we'll definitely do that.
00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000 But they wanted to know, they had no intention of doing it.
00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000 For good reason.
00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000 And then, then what you're talking about the six weeks blindness.
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.000 That occurred later.
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000 So, these miracles happened and like, we saved my eye.
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000 And that was, that was really exciting.
00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000 Then they, you know, but they're, but they're looking at it every day.
00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000 And they do this one test.
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000 And they see this hole in my retina.
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.000 So, that's not a big deal because it's just just a hole.
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000 You know, it means there's some blind spots.
00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000 And as I look at you, I can kind of see the blind spot.
00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000 It's like right in my, it's annoying.
00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000 But I deal with it.
00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000 It's annoying when I read frankly.
00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.000 The problem with that is you're retina.
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:15.000 The anatomy of your retina causes that hole to expand.
00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000 There's a film.
00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000 There's like a membrane on the back of your retina that creates tension.
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000 And so, anytime it's a hole in your retina, that means the hole will just expand slowly.
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.000 So, it's macular degeneration.
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000 This again, this happens with older folks quite a bit.
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.000 The way to fix that is remove the membrane.
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000 We're not really sure why the membrane's on there in the first place.
00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.000 And so, you just remove the membrane and then, you're good.
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000 All right?
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000 But, and that's fine.
00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000 That's actually pretty normal surgery.
00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000 But, for me, it was a really high risk surgery because, you know, my eye is so fragile.
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000 And so, they were worried about the retina attaching.
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.000 Luckily, it did not, you know, because, well, who knows why.
00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000 Again, God's intervention.
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.000 And, but you do have to be faced down for six weeks to recover from that.
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000 So, that was just...
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000 You had to lay face down the entire time for six.
00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:09.000 You have to lay face down because what they do is they inject this gas into your eye.
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000 And that creates a bubble, which creates tension.
00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.000 And if the bubble is meant to be pressed up against your retina to keep it in place.
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000 God, it.
00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000 And the only way for it to press up against your retina is for you to be looking down.
00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000 And so, you just...
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000 Look, damn, it just sucks.
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000 You just have to be faced down, doesn't matter how you're doing it.
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000 Just lay down or walk face down or whatever it is, but just make sure you're facing down.
00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000 You're six weeks.
00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000 And you're blind all the time.
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000 Because, again, most of the time they'll do this like one eye at a time.
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:47.000 So, if somebody can see still, but, you know, I'm not a one eye at a time kind of guy anymore.
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000 That's it.
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.000 There.
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000 You get past that.
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.000 You say, when the six weeks were over, I sat up.
00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000 And it was not blind.
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:04.000 Moreover, with the help of a truly remarkable contact lens from Boston site
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000 to which the Navy referred me years later.
00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000 I was eventually returned to 2020 correctable vision in my left eye.
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000 That's the story of being blown up.
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000 I can't say I recommend the experience.
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:25.000 Yet, even as it was happening, even in the moment after the blast, I had to admit it could have been worse.
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.000 I still had my legs.
00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.000 I had my arms.
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000 I had ten fingers and ten toes.
00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.000 My brain worked.
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000 Even after a severe concussion.
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000 I was still alive.
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:40.000 It is impossible not to constantly think of the many veterans who have sacrificed so much more.
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:48.000 Impossible not to think of seal petty officer, second class, Mike Montsour, who threw himself on a grenade wall on a rooftop in a modding.
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000 I rack 2006, saving his teammates.
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:58.000 Impossible not to think of Air Force Master Sergeant John Chapman, who fought all night against the Taliban.
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000 Coming in and out of consciousness from his wounds, eventually succumbing to them.
01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:11.000 On that Afghan ridge line, but only after earning the Medal of Honor for saving 23 service members.
01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:20.000 Impossible not to think of my platoon members in dear friends, Dave Worson and Pat Feecks, who were killed just two months after I was evacuated from helmet.
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:27.000 Impossible not to think of their loved ones who had been expecting them home a month later.
01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:35.000 Impossible not to think of the eight men whose initials are tattooed on my chest and remembrance.
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000 Charles Keating the Fourth.
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:55.000 Patrick Feecks, Dave Worson, Brad Cavener, Brett Marryu, Kevin Ever, Brendan Looney, and Tom Falk.
01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000 This is the simple reality.
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000 Others have had it harder than me, many, many others.
01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000 From that darkness comes realism.
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:21.000 From that realism comes gratitude, from gratitude comes perspective.
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.000 The healthy sense of perspective is an antidote to outrage.
01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000 It is an antidote to self-pity, despair, and weakness.
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:42.000 It's not a cure all for your mental state when faced with adversity, but it is sure to dull the edges of your worst tendencies toward mental breakdown.
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.000 Yeah.
01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000 That's the perspective that you and I already talked about today.
01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:01.000 That perspective that it would be seem like it would be very helpful for people to think about.
01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000 It is.
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:08.000 And you know, I'm using extreme examples, right?
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000 Not everybody can relate to that, but they don't have to.
01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:18.000 I don't want you to go be in a terrible situation just to earn some perspective.
01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000 Right?
01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:27.000 But just the simple reminder to yourself that it exists.
01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000 Like somebody else has had it harder.
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.000 There's a comfort in that, I think.
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000 And it is an antidote to self-pity.
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:43.000 Self-pity is a gateway to the outrage culture that I think we seal around us.
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:50.000 So if it is a gateway to the socialistic tendencies, I think that we've been seeing as of light,
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.000 and you can avoid these things with some perspective and gratitude.
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:04.000 It's hard for anybody in the teams to ever feel sorry for themselves when you know, because you know of these guys.
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000 And you know some of those guys I listed, of course.
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:19.000 And if there's ever a reason you need to get up in the morning, not at 430, but like later, you know,
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:27.000 get a normal human time, then the boys who wish they could get up, you know, that's a good reason,
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000 because they would like to be able to get up and they can't.
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:35.000 And their widows are really wishing they would get up too, and they can't.
01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:42.000 You know, and the man I swear I mentioned on some heroes, but the widows are the heroes of the seal teams.
01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:51.000 I have yet to meet the wife of one of those guys who fell into self-pity and despair.
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000 I only know ones who have overcome with the greatest grace.
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000 It's just amazing.
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:11.000 I've watched these women just serve as the most ultimate example mothers as well, you know, that I know you know.
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000 Like Debbie Lee for instance.
01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000 Absolutely.
01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:20.000 It's just incredible to watch that fortitude.
01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000 We just couldn't do it without them.
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:44.000 Yeah, so it's always one of the things about Mark's mom and Lafin, I talk about this a lot, is, you know, when we called her from Iraq to talk to her and to console her, she was consoling us.
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000 She was wanted to make sure we were okay.
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000 She wanted to make sure we were handling things.
01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000 She wanted to know if we needed anything.
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000 You know, that was her attitude out of the gate.
01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.000 Yeah.
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:11.000 And that shows you, you know, the kind of people that you're talking about, you know, someone that's taking their own personal worst nightmare that any, you know, any parent could ever have of losing their kid and immediately saying, well, what can I do for you guys?
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000 Yeah.
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000 This is unbelievable.
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000 These, you know,
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:31.000 it was recent, friend, good friend I lost was Chuck Keating the fourth and, you know, his wife started a foundation in his name.
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000 It's dad as well.
01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000 And his family's just been incredible.
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000 But that's not, that's, that's not the exception.
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000 Like that's been the rule from what I've seen.
01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:49.000 And it's so much harder to be the family left behind than it is to, to be us, I think.
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:53.000 And, you know, we go and we choose to do this thing overseas.
01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000 And we're doing it with our brothers and arms and we love it.
01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000 And we know what's coming the next day.
01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.000 We, we're in control to an extent, the greatest extent we can be.
01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000 But our family is not there.
01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000 Their, their life doesn't change except that we're just not there.
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000 And they don't know what's happening.
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000 And then they get a call.
01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000 And I don't actually go into the detail in my wife's experience on the perspectives from darkness.
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000 But, you know, she gets a call.
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:25.000 And so her only consolation is that it's a call and not a guy at the door.
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000 But, you know, it's a call that she's getting before 6 a.m.
01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000 And before she her alarm goes off to go to work.
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:41.000 And, and then there's, you know, the, very typical kind of lack of exact information given to her.
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000 She's not sure what my face looks like because they don't know what my face looks like.
01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000 They're not sure if it's still there. My head is still there.
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000 Like there's all this misinformation.
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000 Enough enough information to just plant seeds of absolute horror.
01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000 It's horrible.
01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:01.000 And guess who, but, but, you know, who, you know, who went there first was the Looney family.
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.000 Oh, you know, it's like it's, it's, it's Amy Looney there.
01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000 You know, who just lost her husband two years earlier.
01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000 And she's the one there, consoling Tara.
01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:21.000 And, um, it's just, uh, that, that's the type of community that the seal teams is blessed with.
01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000 And, um, you know, it's, it is, it is a true blessing.
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000 And it's unique.
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000 I wish it were broader.
01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000 I wish we could say, you know, I, I talked to other friends and other,
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000 other communities.
01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000 Um, that, that, that, that, that, it doesn't seem,
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000 it's not as good and I wish it was.
01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000 I wish, we should all strive to just, to, to take care of each other in that way.
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000 So, rolling into your next chapter and I haven't made my,
01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000 caveat that I always make, I'm not reading this whole book right now.
01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000 And so when it skips around, it's because I'm not reading the whole book.
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000 You have to buy the book so that you can hear the whole thing.
01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000 And, and it, where it's just, you know, when you and I are going off on a bunch of tangents and,
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.000 which is awesome, but, you know, the book that has so many great details in it.
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:12.000 And the stories are so clear and the real personal too.
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000 So, you got to buy the book to get that.
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000 Got to buy the book.
01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000 You got to buy the book.
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000 So, uh, the next chapter, which you mentioned earlier is called,
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000 Who's your hero?
01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000 And I'm going to jump to this part right here where you talk about the seal teams.
01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:31.000 It says the seal teams like any, like many military units are relentless in the pursuit of establishing hero archetypes.
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000 Doing so is extremely important when the goal is to create a monoculture that
01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000 operates as a mission-oriented team.
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000 This is a community with a very deep sense of who we want to be.
01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000 We talk about it all the time and we beat it into our trainees.
01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000 Jocco specifically.
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000 It's it.
01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000 Into our trainees.
01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000 I did some of that.
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000 Here's some of the things that will be beaten into you.
01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000 You will be someone who is never late.
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000 You will be someone who takes care of his men, gets to know them,
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000 and puts their needs before yours.
01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000 You will be someone who does not quit in the face of adversity.
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000 You will be someone who takes charge of means when no one else will.
01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000 You will be detailed oriented.
01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000 Always vigilant.
01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000 You will be aggressive in your actions, but never lose your cool.
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000 You will have a sense of humor because sometimes that is all that can get you through the darkest hours.
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000 You will work hard and perform even when no one is watching.
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.000 You will be creative and think outside the box even if it gets you in trouble.
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:36.000 You are a rebel but not a mute near. You are a jack of all trades and master of none.
01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:42.000 And then you go into the official ethos, which you mentioned earlier.
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000 How is debating if I should read this and I think I'm actually just going to read it?
01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000 It's a good ethos.
01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000 So here we go.
01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000 In times of war or uncertainty, there is a special breed of war.
01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000 You are ready to answer our nation's call.
01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.000 A common man with uncommon desire to succeed.
01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:10.000 Forged by adversity, he stands alongside America's finest special operations forces to serve his country,
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.000 the American people and protect their way of life.
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000 I am that man.
01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:23.000 My Trident is a symbol of honor and heritage, but stowed upon me by the heroes that have gone before.
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000 It embodies the trust of those I have sworn to protect.
01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:33.000 By wearing the Trident, I accept the responsibility of my chosen profession and way of life.
01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000 It is a privilege that I must earn every day.
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.000 My loyalty to country and team is beyond reproach.
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000 I humbly serve as a guardian to my fellow Americans.
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000 Always ready to defend those who are unable to defend themselves.
01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:59.000 I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions.
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:10.000 I voluntarily accept the inherent hazards of my profession, placing the welfare and security of others before my own.
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000 I serve with honor on and off the battlefield.
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:21.000 The ability to control my emotions and my actions, regardless of circumstance, sets me apart from other men.
01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000 Uncompromising integrity is my standard.
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:32.000 My character and honor are steadfast. My word is my bond.
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:37.000 We expect to lead and be led.
01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:44.000 In the absence of orders, I will take charge, lead my teammates, and accomplish the mission.
01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000 I lead by example in all situations.
01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000 I will never quit.
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000 I persevere and thrive on adversity.
01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000 My nation expects me to be physically harder and mentally stronger than my enemies.
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000 If knock down, I will get back up every time.
01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:12.000 I will draw on every remaining ounce of strength to protect my teammates and to accomplish our mission.
01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000 I am never out of the fight.
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000 We demand discipline.
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000 We expect innovation.
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000 The lives of my teammates and the success of our mission depend on me.
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.000 My technical skill, tactical proficiency, and attention to detail.
01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000 My training is never complete.
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.000 We train for war and fight to win.
01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:45.000 I stand ready to bring the full spectrum of combat power to bear in order to achieve my mission
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000 and the goals established by my country.
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:59.000 The execution of my duties will be swift and violent when required, yet guided by the very principles that I serve to defend.
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:08.000 Brave men have fought and died building the proud tradition and feared reputation that I am bound to uphold.
01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:24.000 In the worst of conditions, the legacy of my teammates, studies my resolve and silently guides my every deed, I will not fail.
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000 So that's the CLEFOS.
01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.000 And interestingly, I don't know if you do know where that came from.
01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000 No, it was actually, I just thought about that in the last three seconds.
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000 I would love to be a fly on the wall as this was getting drafted.
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000 So it was written in 2005.
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:46.000 A bunch of us went to San Clemente Island.
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000 I would say there was maybe 10 or 15.
01:13:51.000 --> 01:14:03.000 Probably 10 or 15 team guys that went out to San Clemente Island and made this and made the other like shorter one.
01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:15.000 The little short CLEFOS and it was actually part of what was driving it wasn't response to before I think it was before what year did you get to the teams.
01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000 I started Buds in 2006.
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:27.000 Yeah, okay. So in like 2003, 2004, there was a platoon that just there was a platoon commander that died his hair.
01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:40.000 He was overseas on deployment. Died his hair, blonde, had a pierce earring and was selling drugs to his platoon.
01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000 I mean, just a total disaster.
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:48.000 And then there was a bunch of other, you know, look, as you know, as we know, like we're in the news a lot.
01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:54.000 And there's spikes, we're in their news for some negative things.
01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:02.000 And so there was a couple other really negative things. That was kind of the peak was this guy dealing drugs inside of his own platoon.
01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.000 And the platoon being a total disaster and getting disbanded and sent home from deployment.
01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:11.000 By the way, this is like during a time of war.
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:18.000 So, you know, the admiral who was a great guy said, look, we need to do something about this.
01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:25.000 And that's what we went out and the, and this is what came out of it.
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:31.000 I'm looking at, I still remember some little things like there were some things where I was, you know, a little bit more.
01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.000 I wanted, I wanted them to be a little bit more aggressive on some things.
01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:42.000 Yeah. I remember, I remember I got shut down one of the lines that I was like, no, it should be destroy your enemy.
01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000 Like that's what we do. And it didn't make the cut.
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:56.000 I think it was in, I think it was this part right here where it says, I stand, I stand to, I stand ready to bring the full spectrum of combat power to bear in order to achieve my mission.
01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:06.000 And the goals established by my country. My version, it was to achieve my mission and destroy my enemy or destroy the enemies of our country.
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000 Yeah.
01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000 And I got, I got the reins pulled in on me. There was quite a few, but you know, I did all right.
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000 I mean, we got some discipline in there.
01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.000 I love to see what the Jacob version would be.
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.000 Yeah.
01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000 You wanted to go more aggressive? No way.
01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000 Like that's impossible to believe.
01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:28.000 You know, it's interesting. And one of the reasons that, like a lot of the, the discussion around it,
01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000 and there were some great, and there was a bunch of great guys out there.
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.000 I mean, it was like the animal pit guys to go out there was pretty awesome, a great crew of people.
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:42.000 And at the time, you know, it was 2005, like, we didn't really have as much combat experiences we have.
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000 You know, now, which is just awesome.
01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:51.000 But my attitude was like, listen, we're not writing this for 05s, right?
01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000 We're not writing this for sealed team commanders or commoners.
01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.000 Like this thing should be leveled at the point of aim point of impact should be an E5 team guy.
01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:07.000 Look, I know that this guy that was a, was an officer that had this bad balloon, but like, that's, that's who, not who we're name it.
01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000 We should not have those problems. And like, that's, yes, we got to handle that.
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000 This should be a point of aim point of impact should be an E5 team guy.
01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:18.000 That's, that's, that's needs to understand the ethos and go, hey, I need to do the right thing.
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000 Because by the way, if you're an uplatoon and you've got square to eight Fives, they'll destroy that.
01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000 They'll, they'll crush that officer that's doing dumb things.
01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000 They'll, they'll kill him. Well, not kill him.
01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:35.000 Literally Vietnam, Fraxile, but they will get him removed, you know, and, you know, that's what will happen.
01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.000 So yeah, I think it hits that pretty well.
01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000 Yeah, yeah, it does pretty good. It does pretty good.
01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.000 Yeah, it's, it's a great ethos. And it was awesome to, to be out there when this thing was getting written.
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:57.000 And then see it, you know, it, it, it's always interesting to be a part of things like that that you don't really know, like, I mean,
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:03.000 you don't really understand what you're doing at the time. You know, you're just trying to get the job done, you're trying to do a good job,
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.000 but you don't always know what the impact is going to be later when you, when you do something like that,
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000 but you have some honor to be out there and make that happen or help make that happen again.
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000 There's a bunch of people out there.
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000 I was, I, I, I made very well with it.
01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:23.000 No, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say it was the junior guy, but there, because there was, you know, there was a bunch of mass chiefs out there,
01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.000 a bunch of badass mass chiefs here. So, yeah, it's cool.
01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000 And it's just, it's so important.
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000 And I'm going to stop jumping ahead on the book now that I understand what we're doing because of
01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000 already.
01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000 Yeah, I already hit this part.
01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000 Should I free brief to you?
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000 I guess. Yeah.
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:41.000 But the, it's so important for an organization to understand who they want to be.
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:50.000 And, and that, that was the whole reason I put the ceiling, those in there, because there's a deep cultural mindset that is beaten into us, you know, quite literally.
01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:56.000 There's the more high-minded philosophical approach, which is the seal ethos.
01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:02.000 But it does a good job of relating to the, to the lowest level guy, too.
01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000 But it's, it goes way beyond the seal ethos.
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:12.000 I mean, there's so many other lessons that get repeated like mantras throughout training throughout Buds, about who you are.
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:18.000 Like what it means to be a guy wears the trident, like what that really means.
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000 And, and this is simple stuff, you know, and I listed some of it earlier, right?
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:30.000 I don't quit just beyond time. Like work when no one's watching, you know, it's like just really simple stuff, but it's like, it's who you better be.
01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000 And you better be funny.
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000 Like, you know, that's actually part of our culture.
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000 Part of being better to you better have a really sick sense of humor.
01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:49.000 And like, you better go after each other, but it better be funny, you know, it's got to actually, and like, we rely on that dark humor and a really fundamental way.
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:58.000 I, that I think, maybe, maybe a side of us that isn't as prevalent in all the books and all the movies, but like, I like to think we're pretty, pretty funny.
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:01.000 I mean, I've been on Saturday night live, so obviously I'm funny.
01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:04.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:17.000 Yeah, I know, a thick skin and, you know, the ability to verbally spar with people 24 hours a day from the moment you report into work, the moment you show up until, and any mistake that you make, you better, you know,
01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:23.000 you, you throw a shot on a, you know, while you're shooting, you throw a shot and hit something that you shouldn't hate or whatever.
01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:28.000 It's just sign up for ridicule because that's what's about to happen.
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000 That's the greatest thing.
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000 It really is.
01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000 You got a bunch of stuff in here that's, you start talking about traits.
01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000 And you know, again, it's what you're talking about.
01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000 Some of the traits of you must be someone that can take a joke.
01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:48.000 Uh, did this a very simple.
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000 You want to be productive.
01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000 You want to be someone that makes progress every single day.
01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000 You want to be someone who identifies a goal and sticks with it.
01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000 Again, you don't like about these.
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000 It's just going back to your conversation.
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:02.000 Like, if you think about how you would want your kid to act, these are good things.
01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000 This is how you want your kid to act.
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000 You want to be, you want to be seen as reliable.
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000 You want people to ask things of you because you have a reputation for getting it done.
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000 Reliability is an element of fortune.
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:17.000 A mentally tough person can avoid the next cupcake and save it for later after earning with some exercise.
01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000 You want to be even tempered.
01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000 You don't want to ever want to lose it.
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.000 Emotion don't drive your actions.
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.000 You want to be humble.
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000 You have confidence, but not overbearing.
01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000 Uh, you want to be someone that internalizes someone else's point of view before speaking at them.
01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:32.000 Like, these are the kind of things you're talking about.
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000 And, and you, you, you, you, you say this.
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000 The question is, how do we become the heroes we want to be?
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000 My answer sanctioned intellectual property theft.
01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000 That's how no one has a pat, no one good habits.
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000 You can steal them.
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.000 Identify your heroes and emulate the character traits that make that person more successful than you currently are.
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000 And this, and this gets into, this, I love this.
01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000 This is one of my favorite chapters to write because I love psychology.
01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:03.000 You know, Jordan Peterson's one of my favorite thinkers out there.
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.000 Um, there's a lot of psychological references in this chapter.
01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:12.000 And, um, and another one too, but especially this one.
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000 And hero archetypes.
01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000 And we already already hit what I meant by hero archetypes.
01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000 And that, and I just think that's so important.
01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000 You have to have a visualization of what you're looking up to.
01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000 You have to look at yourself in ten years and think,
01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:30.000 Okay, that's, that's how, how, how would that person react to this situation?
01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000 I should react that way now.
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000 Like, you know, and it's hard.
01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000 And this isn't supposed to be easy.
01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000 And when I say sanctioned intellectual property theft, it's like,
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:42.000 Look at the attributes of people you respect.
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000 You know, like, what did they do?
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:47.000 And like, if you want to get to where they're at, just copy them.
01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000 This isn't, this isn't rocket science.
01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:55.000 Um, you know, this is, any, any of your listeners are like, well, yeah, that's why listen to Jocca.
01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000 Yeah, you know, listen to who is, and you and I were talking about this earlier.
01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.000 Uh, this idea of sanction intellectual property theft, you know,
01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000 uh, extreme ownership.
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:13.000 Is this, is personal responsibility, did I, did I make up personal responsibility in the form of extreme ownership?
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:18.000 No, I didn't, I didn't make up the, you know, discipline equals freedom.
01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000 Did I, am I the first person that ever said, you know what?
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000 If you have discipline in your life, you'll have more freedom.
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000 I mean, it's in the Bible.
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.000 Like, these, these are things that I, old ideas are the best idea.
01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:37.000 And, you know, maybe I wording them away that was easier for people to understand or came out of from a different angle or whatever.
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.000 But the fact of the matter is this stuff's out there.
01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:47.000 And these are these, these traits that you're talking about are just, as you were saying earlier, it's like,
01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:50.000 Oh, if you, we want your kid to not lose their temper.
01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000 That's what you, you want your kid to be reliable.
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000 These are really basic things.
01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:59.000 And yet, if you don't identify them, which is your point.
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000 And you know, that's what, in the Warrior Kid book.
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000 So I read these kids books.
01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:10.000 Well, one of the things in the Warrior Kid books is first his uncle, who's a seal, teaches him all the different codes.
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000 Mm-hmm.
01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000 All the different warrior codes from, from ancient times till today to the Ranger code to the seal code.
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000 They're, they're in the book.
01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.000 And then he says, you need to write your own code.
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.000 And that's what he does in the book.
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.000 Right, his own code of what it means to be a warrior kid.
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.000 And that's what he lives up to.
01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000 So same thing you're saying here.
01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000 Yeah.
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:35.000 And that again, the discussion about hierarchies and why that's kind of an important way of looking at this.
01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:41.000 Because in, in also why I say, you don't pick a person to be your hero.
01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:42.000 You pick many.
01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:48.000 Real or imagine the characters who, who excel in a certain hierarchy.
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000 And that, that's an important thing to define.
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000 There's different types of hierarchies.
01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000 Like some people excel in a jujitsu hierarchy.
01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000 If you want to be good at jujitsu, copy this person.
01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000 Okay.
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000 But you don't listen to everything they say because they might be all screwed up in some other way.
01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000 This is, right?
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000 This is a fact.
01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000 Yeah.
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000 Um, but, but like, you know, follow this leader.
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000 Like, there's something about that leader that I like.
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000 And there's something that makes me want to follow them.
01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000 What is it?
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000 I should identify it.
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000 I can start to emulate those behaviors.
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:23.000 One note I made in, in your book here is,
01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:27.000 I'm a, when you said, when you said to do that, I have plus bad examples.
01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000 And in my latest book, Leadership Strategy and Tactics,
01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:36.000 I had this beautiful situation unfold where I had a horrible officer that we had a mutiny and got him fired.
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:40.000 And then the guy that took over was the best guy ever.
01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000 And super humble gave us ownership.
01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000 I mean, it was just awesome.
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:52.000 But I learned, probably as much from the egotistical guy and seeing how we all reacted to him and seeing
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000 how we didn't want to listen to him.
01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:55.000 We didn't want to follow him.
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000 As I learned from the guy that was just fantastic leader.
01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:06.000 So I look at, you know, hey, here's, I always always pulling the good things from people.
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000 But then also looking at people with negative examples and saying,
01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000 Okay, I know not to act like that.
01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000 The villains.
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000 Yeah.
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000 That hero's got to have villains.
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000 And it's, and I guess the point of that chapter is,
01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:25.000 yeah, to remind people of what some of the good attributes are and to, and to, and to, and to think consciously about identifying those attributes,
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:29.000 identifying yourself as the hero you want to be and then living up to that.
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000 So that's, that's part of it.
01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000 But, but the broader cultural conversation is the fact that,
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.000 Outrage culture is largely this product of the fact that we have,
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.000 we have started to look at the wrong hero archetypes.
01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:46.000 We have started to elevate attributes that are not heroic at all into a heroic,
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000 reality and, and it's, it's not good.
01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000 And it's sort of, that's the second part of the chapter, the wrong heroes.
01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000 And it's, it's, it's what we talked about.
01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000 This is a grieved victim status.
01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.000 The, the loudest person on the internet, the snarkiest person on the internet,
01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000 the one owning the lips or the cons.
01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000 You know, it's like, that one gets the most likes.
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:10.000 Like, it's, it's passion over sophistication.
01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000 And these are not good things.
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000 I understand that it's entertaining, right?
01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000 And I understand the temptation, especially on social media,
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.000 but it's really detrimental to our larger conversation.
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000 You know, why should the fist-banging activist, you know,
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000 you know, speaking of the power, whatever the hell that means,
01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000 why should that be the person we listen to, just because they're mad?
01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.000 Like, why does anger, big get some kind of credibility?
01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.000 It doesn't make any sense, but that's how we're acting as a culture.
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000 It doesn't make any sense, though.
01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000 And like, I just want us to think through that.
01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000 Like, that's the whole point of the chapter.
01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:52.000 And we'd be better off if we started to, to kind of rediscover the heroes
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:56.000 that have gotten us through thousands of years of civilization.
01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000 And again, the oldest ideas are the best ones.
01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.000 If, if people have been talking about certain heroic attributes for thousands of years,
01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.000 there's really good chances or good ideas, because they've lasted.
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000 And they've gone through trial and error.
01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000 But, um, but like every generation, you know,
01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000 you've got to, when you have to teach those the ideals.
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.000 And then, as a young person, you have to stop and think,
01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000 maybe there's a reason it's like this.
01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.000 Maybe I'm not the first one to think in revolutionary terms.
01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.000 You know, like, just maybe, like, there's a reason your granddad
01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000 is telling you it's this way.
01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000 And it's not because he's just stupid and out of touch.
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000 Like, just stop.
01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000 And like, let's think about that as a possibility.
01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000 Yeah, this, it's weird with this.
01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000 I would love to try and trace back the roots of this because one thing,
01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000 like, one time we were on this podcast, we were talking about something.
01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000 And somebody asked a question on a Q&A.
01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:54.000 And I, basically, what I said was, and I think you turned it into a clip,
01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.000 echo tross, is I was saying, like, hey, you got to stifle those emotions.
01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000 But don't let those emotions out.
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.000 What are you kidding me?
01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000 Like, you can't let that show.
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000 And the reaction from some people was, you know, that's horrible.
01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000 You should never stifle your emotions.
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:11.000 They'll, they'll, you, it turns into these, whatever.
01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000 The mental problems and all this stuff.
01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000 And I'm like, people took what I said to the extreme,
01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000 which clearly, I don't really believe in anything extreme.
01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.000 That's why I wrote the book called The Academy of Leadership, right?
01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.000 That's extreme ownership.
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000 Well, well, interestingly, you know,
01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:31.000 extreme ownership can be taken too far.
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:35.000 And you can have people in leadership positions that go to an
01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000 extent where they want to own everything and they don't
01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000 decentralize anything and it becomes a problem.
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:40.000 Yeah.
01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000 So that's why we wrote The Academy of Leadership because you have to find balance in everything.
01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000 So with this idea of stifle your emotions, look,
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.000 oh, if you lose a loved one, I'm not saying you need to, you know,
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000 get your tough the whole time, right?
01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.000 No.
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000 And also as a leader in any position,
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.000 if you're walking around completely stoic with no emotions,
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000 you won't attack, you won't, you won't connect with anybody.
01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000 And so you don't have any personal connections with anybody.
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.000 That's not a seal, Patoon.
01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.000 If you're in a seal, Patoon, and you have no personal connection with your guys in your
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000 Platoon, you're not a leader.
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000 They don't respect you.
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000 They won't follow you.
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000 And I've seen that kind of leader.
01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000 Absolutely.
01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000 It doesn't work.
01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000 It doesn't work.
01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000 So when I say stifle your emotions,
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000 I'm talking about your little petty emotions that you're getting.
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.000 Spongebob out some.
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000 Yeah.
01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000 That's what I'm talking about.
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000 And especially in my business and like a politics,
01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000 like you realize quickly,
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.000 you've got to define what you mean in very clear terms,
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:37.000 because everybody's first reaction is to totally take it out of context or
01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.000 or just assume the worst of what you meant.
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000 Assume the worst of intentions.
01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000 I go into the great amount of detail about this and the book too,
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000 because that's a big marker of outreach cultures.
01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:55.000 This need, this like desire to be like just assume the worst of what you meant.
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000 Oh, stifle my emotions.
01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.000 Okay, just walk around like robots. Of course, that's not what you meant.
01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000 You know, like let's, let's be gracious with how we understand each other,
01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000 just like just a tad.
01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000 We'll be a lot better off.
01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000 Next chapter.
01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000 It's called no plan B, which is, you know,
01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:17.000 got a little counterintuitive sound to it because as a seal,
01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000 and as a human being, you're always like,
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000 oh, you know, you got to have a plan B in case something goes wrong.
01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.000 Yeah.
01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000 Here's your premise behind this.
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:26.000 You don't entertain the plan B option because when you do your entertaining failure.
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.000 And in entertaining failure, you will embrace it ultimately the no plan B mentality
01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:37.000 isn't about keeping you from doing something rather it's about embracing a positive goal
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000 as your only choice.
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000 It's about enabling you to do something.
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:46.000 It's about clearing the paths to your goals, to your achievements,
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000 to your tasks and your responsibilities.
01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.000 So, you're, you explain your idea behind no plan B.
01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:58.000 So, this started out as I was thinking about how not to quit a buzz.
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:01.000 And whenever any time I'd ever been asked that question,
01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000 I would simply say, well, because I never had a choice.
01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:07.000 Because I just didn't think about buzz as a choice.
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.000 I didn't think about it as an achievement that I would, you know, hopefully make.
01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000 It was just like, okay, I just have to do this because that's just I just have to.
01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:20.000 You know, and I think most of us who made it through buzz just had that mentality.
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000 Like, okay, I just have to do another boat race.
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000 And then man, this really sucks.
01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.000 Like, I really hate this.
01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000 But I just, I don't have a choice.
01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000 You know, it's, there's no other option.
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000 There's something liberating about that mentality.
01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000 It's the only mentality you can have.
01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000 And it is truly a no plan B mentality.
01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.000 So, and I'm very, and I'm, and I explain that in the book.
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000 I'm like, I don't mean no contingencies.
01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000 Obviously, you have to plan ahead.
01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.000 But no plan B is fundamentally about not quitting.
01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000 And not quitting needs to be defined rather carefully.
01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.000 You know, and I, and I point out, like, changing directions in life could seem like quitting.
01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.000 It's not necessarily like you're not a good artist.
01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000 Just stop.
01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000 Like you're just not good.
01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000 It's time to change directions, man.
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000 You know, and that's okay.
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000 Like that's, that's okay.
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:16.000 That doesn't, you know, it's, and then I go into a much deeper conversation about living with purpose.
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:20.000 Ultimately, what I mean by living your plan A and not living your plan B,
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000 it is about living with purpose.
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:30.000 And purpose is, is something only you can tell really if you're living up to it or not.
01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000 It's hard to tell from the outside.
01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000 But you know, you know if you quit.
01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:40.000 Like you know if you just didn't do the right thing to, to, to live up to your angle.
01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:46.000 And, and, and, and, and, and execute the millions of smaller tasks that you need to execute to live up to your angle.
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:52.000 And, and I think this is also the chapter where I really go into some deeper discussions about,
01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:57.000 uh, uh, uh, one of my favorite quotes from St. John Paul or Pope John Paul II,
01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:02.000 which is, you know, America freedom is, is, is, is, it's not the right to do what you want, but,
01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000 but, but, but the, what the freedom to do what you ought, right?
01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:11.000 I'm screwing up that quote a little bit, but the point is this, you live with ordered liberty.
01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000 Ordered liberty means we live with a purpose.
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:20.000 Like we have, we have freedom, and with that freedom, we have a responsibility to live as we ought to live.
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.000 Now we have to define, okay, what is living, how we ought to live, like that's a whole other discussion.
01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.000 And this is why religion is so important. This is why religion is such an important foundation.
01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:33.000 Our Judeo Christian history is a very important foundation of our culture.
01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:40.000 Even if you don't believe in God, you have to admit that we get our morality from this place, from the ten commandments.
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:47.000 And that matters, like it matters in a really deep way.
01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:53.000 And I'm a right, you know, kind of that sense of absolute morality, where our laws come from,
01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:59.000 where this notion comes from of what it is to do the right thing, how do you define the right thing?
01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000 Again, we've already talked about this.
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:07.000 If it's based in thousands of years of wisdom and trial and error, there's a good chance that it's right.
01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000 Okay, not a guaranteed chance, but there's a really good chance.
01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:19.000 Even if it doesn't feel good or doesn't feel nice and compassionate, it's real, and it creates a sustainable society.
01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:23.000 And ultimately, sustainable societies should be our angle.
01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:28.000 Our outreach culture is counter to a sustainable society.
01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:33.000 It is chaos manifested in our words and our actions.
01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:40.000 Yeah, you say here, pure freedom is chaos, anarchy and moral decay, freedom to do what you like without any more.
01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:47.000 Compass can quickly result in the temptation to indulge in habits that may feel good momentarily, but are wholly detrimental to yourself and others.
01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:58.000 Pure freedom detached from a higher sense of purpose results in at best in overindulgence, lack of discipline, unfaithful relationships, and some drug use at worst,
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:03.000 it can result in the total deterioration of a society.
01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:13.000 And you know, I think it was actually Jason Gardner when before he was out of the team, but he was listening to podcast and he was hearing me talk about,
01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:19.000 I think he was hearing me talk about the Gulogzer or just something, and he goes, hey, discipline equals freedom.
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000 That applies to societies too, doesn't it?
01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:32.000 Yes, it does. If you have total freedom, everyone do it whichever you want, well then you're destroyed and you end up a slave to, well, you end up a slave to any number of things,
01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:41.000 whereas if you have discipline inside of a society which is called law and order and you fall those rules, well then you actually end up with more freedom, which is what we try to hear.
01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000 Yeah, discipline equals freedom is the simplest way of putting that because it's very true.
01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:51.000 And it's been true for a very long time.
01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.000 Indeed, indeed.
01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:58.000 Next chapter, again, I'm jumping forward here, next chapter, this is the chapter.
01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.000 This is the chapter.
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000 You put got to read the book, you don't want more.
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000 Absolutely, there's a lot more in there.
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:11.000 There's a ton. And you do, you give a lot of, almost academic level back up.
01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:19.000 So you give some common sense stuff, you give some academic and you talk about the psychological, psychological viewpoint of things, some historical references.
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:27.000 You do a great job of balancing out what you're saying and showing multiple examples from different aspects.
01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:35.000 So that's why the book you have to read the book to get all that information.
01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:38.000 The next one is called Be Still.
01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.000 I got to read this little section in the sealed teams.
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:45.000 Our first exercise in training, the mind to be still is drown proofing.
01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.000 And yes, it is as ridiculous as it sounds, as legend has it.
01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000 And it may indeed just be legend.
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:59.000 Drown proofing originates from the story of an American POW in Vietnam as the vehicle and transported him along the May Kong River.
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:03.000 They decided they'd have enough, had enough of him and threw him overboard.
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.000 But this was not some magnanimous gesture of human civility.
01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:12.000 He was not being released for good behavior. They expected him to drown.
01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000 It was reasonable expectation.
01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000 His hands were tied behind his back and his feet were tied together.
01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000 Visualize that for a four second.
01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:23.000 This creates quite the predicament, especially when you are trying not to drown.
01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000 He had to figure out how to swim to shore.
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000 And as the story goes, he did just that.
01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:32.000 Ever since then, a key element of seal training involves drown proofing us,
01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:37.000 making sure that we too can jump from a boat with our hands and feet tied.
01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000 And then you go over the multiple ways to do this.
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:45.000 And you say here, to do this, it requires that you do not panic.
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.000 Wall instructors are yelling, don't panic.
01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:58.000 And that's, you know, you talked about that as being sort of one of your first lessons in learning how to be called.
01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000 And not freak out about stuff.
01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:05.000 It's, it's such a necessary part of of military training.
01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.000 And drown proofing is an excellent way to do it.
01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.000 Not, not because we actually think that might happen.
01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000 How unlucky with that be.
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.000 That be unlucky.
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.000 Or lucky. And it's like, wow, okay, you're just like training.
01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.000 They put a weight on you, though, your screwed or, you know, there's a lot of ways to tie you up.
01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:22.000 Anyway, I'm not the point.
01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:26.000 The point is not that you're preparing for this specific eventuality.
01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:35.000 The point is is that you, you have a set of skills and you better implement those skills while the fear of drowning is all around you.
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:41.000 And of course, it gets worse than the drown proofing gets into the dive comp or pull comp, which is,
01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000 It's probably my least favorite thing.
01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:47.000 When I got to Buds, I had no idea what it was.
01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:52.000 They had a Texas chainsaw massacre movie poster up, but it had, it was crossed out.
01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000 It said Buds pull comp, massacre.
01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000 They had like, drown a regulator on the person getting murdered by leather face.
01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000 Yes.
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:00.000 Yeah.
01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.000 So I was like, well, what that is, but yeah, sure enough.
01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.000 Sounds great.
01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000 I'll sign me up, you know.
01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000 I think I can.
01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.000 Yeah.
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000 I failed to go and pull comp.
01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:15.000 I failed and I was recycled to the next class.
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.000 No, I mean, I, I, I, we, I got to retest again on Monday.
01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000 So we took pull comp on Friday.
01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.000 Yeah.
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000 And we got retested on Monday if we failed.
01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.000 Okay.
01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000 Well, yeah, I mean, I failed first couple of times.
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.000 I, I don't very rarely really feel through the first time.
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.000 Yeah.
01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.000 I was not happy.
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.000 What's full comp?
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000 Pull comp is they put an old school dive, Greg on you, select the old school
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000 School of Tanks and this thing called the, what's it called?
01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000 Do holes regulator?
01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.000 I think there's a hose that comes in that brings the ear in and there's one that you blow out.
01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:52.000 And they put you down on the bottom of the pool and they just start to just mess with you.
01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000 They rip your regulator, the rip your mask off.
01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:58.000 And then they start tying knots in your regulator that you have to then untie underwater.
01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.000 And you have to follow all these proper procedures to get everything back on.
01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000 Meanwhile, they're slapping you in the head.
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.000 They're grinding your face into the thing, into the pool deck.
01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000 And it's, it sucks.
01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:15.000 And eventually they tie something called a whammy knot, which is a knot that you can't get out.
01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:18.000 And so they tie this whammy knot.
01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000 And then you have to go to proper ditching procedures, which means you take your rig completely off.
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000 You have to attempt to get it to work.
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000 If you can't get it to work, you take off your weight belt.
01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000 You lay it over your rig.
01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.000 And then you look at your instructor.
01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:33.000 You give them the thumbs up and then you do a proper free swimmer ascent.
01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.000 And if you mess up any of you, and there's procedures for everything.
01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000 And if you mess them up, then you fail.
01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:42.000 So, but it's, it, it's, it's, it's no joke.
01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:45.000 Like they come out and freaking hammer you.
01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.000 Yeah, that's a man.
01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:49.000 And then they always, they always get you as you have vexed.
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.000 So, yeah, they're watching the bubbles.
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000 And they're the wave.
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000 And then the wave, they call it a surf hit.
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000 Like, so they're simulating this wave.
01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:02.000 This amazingly complex wave that somehow ties your hoses and knots.
01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000 It's like, isn't true.
01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000 That's not real, okay?
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:07.000 Like there's no wave like that.
01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.000 But it's not the point.
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000 You know, it's, it's, it's same with drown proofing.
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000 But the point is not to prepare you for this eventuality.
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000 There is no way in hell that your hoses will ever be tied to knots.
01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000 Mostly because you'll never use a rig like this.
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000 That actually can be tied to knots because this rig is not,
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000 It's, it's just for training.
01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000 So, that's not the point.
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000 The point is the procedures.
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000 The point is you're drowning.
01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:33.000 Will you still calm yourself and work through procedures?
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000 That's the entire point of the exercise.
01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:38.000 If you panic, you are going to fail.
01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:42.000 And there's physiological reasons for that because you're using more objects.
01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.000 And freaking out.
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.000 And there's psychological reasons and just the instructor, these instructors are seals.
01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000 They don't want to guy in the teams that's going to be on a dive with them.
01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000 That's going to freak out if something goes wrong.
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000 Because stuff goes wrong when you're diving.
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.000 So that, that to, you know, from your perspective was a, was a,
01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:03.000 The initial recognition of like, hey, I better be calm.
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.000 Right.
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000 Be still as you say.
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000 And yeah, the reason I say it,
01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:13.000 But the reason I say it, but he's still because I was thinking of the patrolling acronym that we use.
01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000 Okay.
01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000 So, you know, stop looking, listen, smell.
01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.000 Mm-hmm.
01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000 And that's exactly what it sounds like.
01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:22.000 You stop because you've, you've done something to the environment.
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000 Maybe you landed with a helicopter.
01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000 And that's actually, you know, I don't want to give too much away in the book.
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000 But there's a really great intro to this chapter, everybody.
01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000 You've got to buy it and know what it is.
01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:37.000 And so you stop and you've, you've created a disturbance.
01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:42.000 So stop and look around, just chill and look around and then keep moving.
01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000 That's, cells, cells.
01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:45.000 We just, that's what we say.
01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.000 And it's patrolling tactic.
01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000 It also kind of sounds like still.
01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000 And it's kind of the same meaning.
01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.000 Same old for sure.
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000 That's why I named it chapter B still.
01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:58.000 And, um, and then you apply that to your life.
01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:04.000 Because I, I understand that not everybody is going to be thrown overboard with their hands and feet type.
01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.000 But if you are, I go in a great detail about how to overcome that particular predicament.
01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:10.000 It is possible.
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000 Yeah, there's, there's a lot of methodology there.
01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000 It's much easier than you think, as long as you don't panic.
01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:21.000 So, and, uh, it'll, this is another chapter called do something hard.
01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:22.000 So, hey, you know what, you're do something hard.
01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000 It could be drowned proofing.
01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:24.000 And everybody can do this.
01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000 Do it with a buddy that you're not doing.
01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000 Do it with a buddy.
01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.000 Do it with a buddy.
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:29.000 It's a good answer.
01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000 That's the worst thing.
01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000 One up one down.
01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000 Luckily, it's hard to tie your hands behind your back without a buddy.
01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:41.000 So, um, the, uh, the point is this, it's, again, old lessons, count to ten before you react.
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:44.000 But that's, it's fundamentally what this chapter is about.
01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:53.000 And we have a, had a habit lately, given the, um, given the extreme nature of our, uh, kind of immediate gratification that occurs with social media,
01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:56.000 to react very quickly and wildly about things.
01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:01.000 Um, our media reacts unbelievably quickly and wildly about things.
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:04.000 And it is, it is a disservice to our country.
01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:09.000 It is, I mean, I, that's an extreme statement, but it is true, it has gotten out of hand.
01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000 And it's, it's so bad that I felt the need to write this book.
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.000 Um, our media doesn't, but we're, but again, their media is feeding off of us.
01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000 We have to do better as individuals.
01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:23.000 We have to, to say, like, that's not going to work on me.
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000 You know, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that,
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000 that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that quick over the top reaction is not going to work on me.
01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:33.000 I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to feed into it. I'm not going to reward it.
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000 That's, that's, that's our duty.
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000 You have to not click on click bait headlines.
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.000 Yeah.
01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000 Well, I mean, I can't help myself.
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.000 I'm going to click on the click, but I'm not going to react to it, right?
01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:47.000 So that's the, you know, and even for good practice, go ahead and click on it.
01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:50.000 See if it makes you mad. And if it does do it again.
01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:54.000 It's, like, just, it's incredible when you, when you click on a clickbait article.
01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:59.000 And I'm talking mainstream news media. And you go, oh, my gosh, I can't believe that happened.
01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000 And then you click on it and you're like, wait a second.
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:01.000 Yeah.
01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.000 That's not what happened.
01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000 I just got click baited.
01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000 Don't let it happen.
01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:11.000 And the problem is, well, actually, see the problem is, is that people don't click.
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000 The problem is, oh, that's really, that's, and I go into the,
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000 and a lot of detail on that actually, I give some example.
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000 I could give examples every single day.
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.000 I just kind of chose some random ones for the book.
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:29.000 But an example might be, the examples I use in the book are regarding something like environmental regulations.
01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000 Because this is a very emotional topic for people.
01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:37.000 When you hear the Trump administration repealed 12 Obama era environmental regulations.
01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:41.000 Here's what you're thinking. And be honest, this is what you're thinking.
01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:45.000 You're thinking black or green sludge, oozing into a river.
01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:49.000 You're thinking black smoke, like emanating from a factory, all of a sudden,
01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.000 while these corporate fat cats count their money and birds are falling out of the sky.
01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000 Like, this is what you're thinking.
01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000 If you're being, like, this is the visualization that occurs.
01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000 But is it true?
01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:00.000 Nobody asks the second question.
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.000 Is it true?
01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:02.000 Yeah.
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:03.000 What does this actually mean?
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:04.000 Or what does it mean?
01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.000 Or like, why would they deregulate that?
01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000 You know, why was it put in place just a few years ago?
01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:14.000 You know, I mean, like, what kind of regulation wasn't?
01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000 You know, is there a good reason for it?
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:21.000 And then I go into basically a case study on something called new source regulation.
01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000 And we don't have to talk about it now.
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:26.000 But it's, I basically write a case study on this because it's important.
01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000 Like, there's, there's good examples and there's, and there's,
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:33.000 there's, and then the headline about that particular regulation.
01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:39.000 Basically said, you know, Trump is removing air pollution regulations.
01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:42.000 So again, your mind goes to those places I just talked about.
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000 The article itself kind of gives both sides.
01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000 It's actually not about article. And this is usually the case.
01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000 And my experience, because I, you know, do this every day.
01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.000 And my experience, the, the writer, the journalist is not always,
01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.000 but a lot of times, like, actually kind of gives a balanced article.
01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.000 But the editorialized headline is terrible.
01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000 Totally misleading.
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.000 You know, that their own article debunks the headline.
01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:07.000 And you're like, what the hell is going on here, okay?
01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.000 Now, a lot of that's oftentimes because the journalist is not the one writing the headline.
01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:15.000 Okay, so that's, that's a whole different story.
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:19.000 And then you look into it, right? And it's like, okay, well, it turns out,
01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:22.000 yeah, they want to, they want to make it easier for factories to,
01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:27.000 to update their systems or, or power generation plans to update their systems.
01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.000 They don't want to have them go through this new source review regulation,
01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.000 which is extremely costly and unpredictable.
01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.000 And environmentalists say, well, that's just, that's just,
01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000 you're just giving away to corporations, right?
01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000 You're deregulating them, but it's like, well, no.
01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:46.000 And as it turns out, if you want to put a carbon capture addition to your power plan,
01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000 which means capturing more pollutants or carbon dioxide,
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:51.000 then you can't.
01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.000 You can't go through this extremely costly new source review.
01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000 Well, maybe we should stop that.
01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000 You know, like, thinking that's, and that's the background.
01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000 You know, I can go to a lot more detail on that, but just one example.
01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.000 I could think of an example almost every single day.
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.000 Like, the headline just isn't what you think, you know?
01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000 But let's, let's bring it back to coronavirus.
01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:19.000 So the headline is, you know, the Trump administration screwed up the coronavirus test.
01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.000 Like, South Korea is testing 20,000 people a day,
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:26.000 and we've only done like, you know, 10,000 tests or something.
01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.000 And by the time you're listening to this podcast, that reality has changed drastically,
01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000 but in our current moment, that's what happened in the last couple months.
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.000 And there's some truth to that, like the America was behind on tests,
01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000 but who's actually at fault?
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000 Ask the question, right?
01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.000 And then look into the answer from some different sources.
01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000 Because the truth is FDA never approved any South Korean test.
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000 For all we know, those tests aren't very high quality.
01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000 There's different kinds of tests.
01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000 You know, they might give false positives or false negatives.
01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000 That stuff matters when you're trying to control an epidemic.
01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.000 You know, it would be easy to just buy the South Korean test.
01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000 We don't do that.
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:04.000 Because Trump said we don't want to do it.
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000 And not because Trump isn't taking it seriously.
01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:07.000 It's not even Obama.
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000 It's actually none of their fault.
01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000 It's just our system.
01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:14.000 Our system is in there for a reason.
01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:20.000 Like, we have a very strict system from the FDA on what kind of test can be used for stuff like this.
01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000 Now, that exists for a decent reason.
01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:28.000 For instance, if people remember the, I think it's called Theranos.
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.000 The, the lady who has fake the fake cancer test.
01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000 That's absolutely called Theranos.
01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.000 Yeah.
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.000 Absolutely.
01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:36.000 Yeah.
01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:37.000 You're very sure of that.
01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000 No, I tracked on that big time because there's a, there's a very interesting case study.
01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:41.000 Yeah.
01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000 You're in the corporate.
01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000 Yeah, for about a million different reasons.
01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000 It's a really interesting case story.
01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.000 And just that.
01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000 Yeah, fake the cancer treatment.
01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:50.000 It was just cancer.
01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:55.000 It was like, hey, you can identify literally hundreds and hundreds of problems that you could have medically
01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:00.000 from a single pin prick of blood, which was just just completely not true.
01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:01.000 Not true.
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:02.000 Just not true.
01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:12.000 Now, going into more detail, that particular lab was federally regulated and qualified under a certain type of regulation through CMS.
01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:16.000 But they, but not through the FDA's regulations.
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.000 Okay.
01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.000 So eventually they were caught, right?
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000 And that that's what it's for.
01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000 Like, that's what the regulation is for.
01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:25.000 So it's still annoying, right?
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:29.000 It we should have more tests for the coronavirus available.
01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:32.000 But our system was not designed to make that happen quickly.
01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.000 It should have been.
01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:37.000 I'm not saying there's not room for some lessons learned here and some change and we will make those changes actually.
01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.000 The administration frankly already has.
01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000 So.
01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:47.000 But the only way to do it is to get the private sector involved and to give them the flexibility to do the test and then to,
01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:51.000 and then to streamline the FDA's testing of that test so that we know it's actually a decent test.
01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000 You know, there was this.
01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000 The point is, right?
01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000 Like, stop and think and wonder.
01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000 Be curious.
01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:02.000 Like, is.
01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000 Is it true that a test is just a test?
01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.000 Like, of course not.
01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:07.000 Like, there's all different types.
01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:08.000 It's a number.
01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:09.000 You know what I mean?
01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000 It's a summer lab, some of our test kits, like, someone were accurate then others.
01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:17.000 Like, is it possible that it's more complicated than the headline is telling you?
01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000 Is it possible?
01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000 Is it just a little bit possible?
01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:28.000 You know, and again, when I say the media does such a disservice, it's because it's so, you know, you should have somewhat of a combat of media against government.
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:33.000 You know, their point is a check in balance against government.
01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000 But you would hope that their purpose would be to educate.
01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.000 And that I believe that has changed radically.
01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:47.000 I believe they don't longer view it as there is their duty to educate the public.
01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:50.000 They, they only see confrontation as their duty.
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:55.000 And I don't find that to be a good service to the American people.
01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:59.000 I would say that is an accurate statement.
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:05.000 The news does that or has been doing that a lot though, even like regular local news, they do that where they'll.
01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.000 And but it's not you don't click on it, but it's the same concept when they say,
01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:13.000 You're is yourself own killing you.
01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:14.000 More ready, Levin.
01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:17.000 You know, so it's like, that's the clickbait right there.
01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000 They've been doing that for a long time.
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000 And then yeah, then you, then you listen to it because you're like,
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:24.000 It might be killing me.
01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:25.000 Yeah, I listen to it.
01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:29.000 And then it's like, Oh, yeah, you know, someone dropped their cell phone and it like made them,
01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000 You know, do something they killed.
01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000 Do something to be like totally innocuous.
01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.000 Yeah, yeah, deep bumps the headline.
01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000 Speaking of headlines.
01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000 Next chapter.
01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:46.000 Sweat the small stuff. This chapter. This is the chapter I gave you permission to complain.
01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:50.000 Permission to moan and grown about the nitty gritty small, but annoying ankle biting in conveniences.
01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000 We face in our everyday lives.
01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:55.000 Permission to gripe about even your smallest troubles.
01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:00.000 Grumble about long lines at the drive through and wind about the imperfect weather.
01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:03.000 I'm actually going to encourage it. You're welcome.
01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000 Okay, don't think me yet.
01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:06.000 There are certain ground rules.
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.000 One, sweating the small stuff is okay, but exercise your complaints lightheartedly.
01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:14.000 Seek out humor in your whining, be humble, be self aware.
01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:19.000 Two, if you're all, if you allow yourself to sweat the small stuff and I think you should,
01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:23.000 Then you must also force yourself to be detail oriented.
01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:30.000 Three, if you allow yourself to sweat the small stuff, then you must try your hardest not to sweat the big stuff.
01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000 What are you talking about here?
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:40.000 What actually kind of goes back to when you got a, I just restrained myself from moving to this chapter when you set it before.
01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.000 When you got a bunch of criticism, right?
01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:46.000 For saying, don't be emotional about stuff.
01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:49.000 And people are like, well, you can't tell me that.
01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.000 And then it makes the emotional, ironically.
01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:58.000 But in your reaction was, okay, I'm not saying, be a robot.
01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.000 You know, I'm just saying, like, don't let it get the best of you.
01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.000 And so I really wanted to be like, oh my god, it's like my chapter about sweating the small stuff.
01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:10.000 Because because of every time you're told, you know, oh, don't sweat the small stuff.
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000 And I'm like, well, I don't know about that.
01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.000 I think there's some venting that has to occur.
01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:22.000 And I think we take it a little too far in the seal teams.
01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.000 Oh yeah.
01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:29.000 I mean, we complain about the smallest of things, but there's like, but I, and I examined that.
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000 Like, this chapter is about examining that truth.
01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.000 Why do we do that? Are we a bunch of divas?
01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000 Yes. Yes.
01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.000 But that is the, that is true. Two things going to occur.
01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:40.000 That's true.
01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000 Things can be true at once.
01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:46.000 We can be divas, but there's also a deeper reason and value to it.
01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000 As long as you do it right.
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:54.000 And I try to examine that carefully in this chapter about what the right way is to complain.
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.000 And like I try to set some ground rules, like be funny.
01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.000 Being funny is a decent way to do things.
01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000 It can't be too serious.
01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:08.000 Like there's a difference between complaining about how crappy the coffee is at the command.
01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:13.000 And complaining about the actual command atmosphere to your guys.
01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000 There's a, there's a big difference.
01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:18.000 From a leadership perspective, there's a difference there.
01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.000 Like one can be kind of funny and just like, oh yeah, stupid, whatever.
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:26.000 Coffee's crap and the, the buildings stupid or whatever.
01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000 Like the same things people that the gym isn't hard enough.
01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:32.000 There's not enough weights because I'm stronger than whatever.
01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:35.000 You know, typical dumb team guy complaints.
01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000 There's a difference as a leader.
01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.000 That's what the gym is complaints though.
01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000 Yeah, especially.
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:39.000 Yeah.
01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000 No, I completely all the time.
01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000 Like, oh, because we're out of 45 pound plates.
01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000 You know, my deadlift.
01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:55.000 But the, um, just as a leader, especially the big difference between that and being like our CEO is messed up.
01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.000 Yeah.
01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.000 That's, that's, this is one of the things I talk about leadership strategy and tactics is like,
01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:06.000 If you are just white washing everything, this coffee is fantastic.
01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000 And it sucks.
01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.000 Your guys are starting to look at you going, okay, wait a second.
01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.000 You're, you're not real. And you think that you're, you're not questioning.
01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000 You're not pushing back against anything.
01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.000 However, like you said, if you come down and you say,
01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.000 or commanding officers in the idiot, that's going to be problematic.
01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.000 So you got to, you got to be careful about what you're complaining about.
01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:29.000 To your point, complaining, forms some level of bond, right?
01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000 That's one of the things that we do in the teams.
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:31.000 Yeah.
01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:35.000 Like we're going to complain about the, the freaking birthing that we have.
01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:36.000 And the this, that, the other thing.
01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000 And it's like, okay, cool, because we're all in the same team.
01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:42.000 I'm playing about it. But if somebody starts complaining about things that matter
01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000 at a more strategic level, now we got a problem.
01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:50.000 The other part of the don't sweat the, the sweat, the small stuff mentality is the
01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.000 Detailory Antipart. This is really important because one, being detailed,
01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000 Detailory Antid is an element of fortitude.
01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:56.000 I would argue.
01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000 I think rather effectively.
01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:02.000 And I wrapped it into this chapter though.
01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:06.000 And you can probably wrap the detail oriented mindset into many of the lessons in this
01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:09.000 chapter. But I put it into this one because if you're sweating the small stuff, then by definition,
01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000 you work in certain about small things.
01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:18.000 And it's not self-evident to me that being so chillax about all the stuff is a virtue.
01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:23.000 And we sometimes see that as a virtue like like the big, I know like the, the dude from the big
01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.000 LeBouceking, that guy doesn't care about anything.
01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:27.000 But is that good?
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:28.000 Well other than bowling.
01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000 It's why Russians.
01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000 He was pretty passionate about those things.
01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000 That is true.
01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.000 Another occasion, Harry.
01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:39.000 But you know, it's like, you know, you're that, that cool kid in high school.
01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:42.000 Who just like, let's everything roll off their back.
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000 You know, it's like the cool surfer dude.
01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000 I got it. I'm not saying there's no value in that.
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:50.000 But it's not self-evident to me that that's what we should aspire to.
01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:55.000 Because it's not obvious to me that that they're a highly productive people.
01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.000 Maybe they are.
01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000 Not saying they can't be.
01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:03.000 But if you're not concerned with small things, there's a pretty decent chance.
01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:08.000 You're not concerned about bigger questions in life, about bigger elements of personal responsibility.
01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:14.000 Or you, you might not be that motivated to, to move up the hierarchy that we talked about.
01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:19.000 And so being concerned with the small stuff is, is a habit.
01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.000 It's an Aristotelian.
01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:26.000 And the Aristotelian sense, we build good habits that that are, that are meant for a higher purpose.
01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000 That's what makes them a good habit.
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000 We do it because it is good.
01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.000 And so that's the deeper thing here.
01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000 Yeah, complain a little bit.
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000 Like, like, especially, you know, on the way.
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000 I'm the way here.
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:41.000 We're going down, uh, as at Midway Drive.
01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:45.000 And, um, San Diego has often had this problem.
01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:50.000 And I've complained about it for a very long time, which is that the lights are not synchronized.
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000 They're not synchronized for traffic flow.
01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000 The way like New York City is in Manhattan.
01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:56.000 Those are well synchronized lights.
01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.000 One of my biggest pet peeves is the lights are not synchronized.
01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000 Because it's a solvable problem.
02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:07.000 Might and too, but to synchronize the lights, you know, as a city manager or a mayor or a
02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000 or a systemist.
02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:15.000 And, uh, it's like, as I was going from red light to red light, trying to get to, to
02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:20.000 Jocco's podcast because I cannot be late because I just wrote in my book that I gave him
02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000 Don't be late.
02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000 That was funny.
02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:27.000 I was like, these different lights.
02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:33.000 You know, and so, that my wife is like, I am so sick of hearing you can play in about the
02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:37.000 where she's like, she hates this chapter because she's so used to the seal team culture.
02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000 She's like, why do you even write this?
02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:40.000 Like, don't encourage this.
02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:43.000 I'm like, I'm trying to encourage it to the right extent.
02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:46.000 You know, and because it is, I am walking a fine line for sure.
02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:51.000 Um, and we're trying to, we're trying to, you know, reverse some, some commonly held beliefs.
02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000 And, uh, it was a fun chapter to write.
02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.000 It was one of my favorite.
02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:58.000 Yeah, and obviously you just met me that dichotomy of this is if you get so focused on
02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:02.000 little things, then you are wasting your time, you know, you're wasting your time.
02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:08.000 The, the, uh, mats on my personal home gym, my, our dirty.
02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:12.000 And people say, you're, that's, you need to clean your mats.
02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:13.000 What kind of discipline is that?
02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.000 I'm like, look, I would have to spend an hour a day clean those mats to make them look
02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.000 clean.
02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.000 Maybe even more than that.
02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000 I don't, I don't care.
02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:25.000 But it's my garage gym. There's chalk on the floor and sweat.
02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:26.000 Yeah.
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.000 That's the way it is.
02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:28.000 I'm not worried about it.
02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000 Yeah, and that's, that's a really good point too.
02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:37.000 And it's, it's, well, it makes, especially makes sense in the, in the context of the dichotomy, right?
02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000 Right.
02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000 Right.
02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:42.000 And like, and I, and I hope that what I write there,
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:48.000 helps people understand that there is a balance, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's operating in that gray area.
02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.000 So that you can focus on the big stuff because, you know,
02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:55.000 seals like to complain about wet socks, like a lot.
02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:59.000 I could say, and I, and I go into great detail about this.
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:05.000 And we avoid wet socks that, you know, to an extreme extent.
02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:11.000 But when, when things get really hard, you know, we, the complaining seems to stop.
02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:17.000 When things are really serious, we understand and have some perspective about that.
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000 And we, when we act accordingly.
02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:24.000 And, uh, and I think that's perfectly relatable to regular life.
02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:28.000 You know, it's, it's why we go, it's why we go and do happy hours after work.
02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:32.000 You know, you're just, you're blowing off some steam in a healthy way.
02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000 Why people go see a therapist.
02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:38.000 Like, you're, you're really just, you're really just complaining to the therapists for an hour.
02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000 And that's, that's not a big thing.
02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:41.000 That's there.
02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:42.000 That goes so.
02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:43.000 Yeah.
02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000 It's like, it's like, you're just kind of letting that steam out so that you're, you're, you're, you're,
02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.000 you're, you're holding tank of emotions doesn't explode in somebody's face.
02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000 And that's because that's how you lose an eye.
02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.000 Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000 Uh, next chapter.
02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.000 The right sense of shame in America today, we too often look at personal feelings
02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000 as things to overcome move past or forget.
02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:11.000 Sometimes we should do one or all of those things, but we should also do something else.
02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.000 Learn our lesson.
02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:19.000 And we'll listen to public figures who run headlong and to self inflicted failure,
02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:26.000 personal political or otherwise, and then reemerge shameless without having appeared to learn a thing is long.
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:27.000 Don't get me wrong.
02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:30.000 I'll know opponent of redemption far from it.
02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.000 I certainly believe there should be space for reemergement, reemergence from public sport.
02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:35.000 Scorn.
02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.000 I believe redemption is a trademark of an enlightened society.
02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:42.000 One of the most more detestable social trends now is mocking,
02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:47.000 is the mocking of redemption and the dismissing of the idea that it is possible or even desirable.
02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:56.000 In place of a system of repentance, justice, and mercy, we have a culture of mindless fury and outrage culture.
02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:02.000 So you, you, you've talked about this sense of shame, which is like a really important thing.
02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:08.000 And I, I looked at this from a team guy perspective, the amount of shame, like for instance,
02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000 if you forget a piece of gear, you,
02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:14.000 when, when a guy in one of my platoons or my task you to make a mistake,
02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:24.000 I almost never had to do anything other than simply very quietly acknowledge that that I saw.
02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000 I can't know you know.
02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:31.000 And they would take, crushed the shame would just drive them to never make that mistake again.
02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:36.000 That's what you're talking about here that we've kind of lost that in a sense.
02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000 Like in a huge sense.
02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:42.000 And in a huge sense, and then the other side of that is like, hey, just because you forgot something,
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000 doesn't mean I go, I don't want you in this platoon, you're a piece of shit.
02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000 You can get, no, no, no, no, no, it's like, it's okay.
02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:54.000 Hey, you made a mistake, you own it, you admit it, you tell me what you're going to do to fix it.
02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:57.000 And then we're back on the level and I'm, you know, we're ready to move forward,
02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000 which we don't have.
02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:03.000 And then of course, you go into this whole episode that took place with a,
02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:09.000 a comedian whose name is Pete Davidson.
02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:10.000 Is this name?
02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:11.000 Yep.
02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:15.000 So this guy, this guy is on Saturday night live one night.
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000 And he says, they put a picture up of you.
02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.000 And they put a bunch of, a bunch of politicians up there.
02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:25.000 And then they put a picture of you up in this guy, Pete Davidson says,
02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000 this guy is kind of cool.
02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:28.000 David's incorrect.
02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000 Dan Crenshaw.
02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:35.000 You might be surprised to hear he's a congressional candidate from Texas
02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.000 and not a hitman in a porno.
02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:42.000 The audience, howled, or as the audience, howled,
02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000 Davidson jumped in with a quick aside.
02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000 I'm sorry.
02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:50.000 I know he lost his eye in war or whatever.
02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:55.000 So, that happened.
02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:56.000 Yeah, that happened.
02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.000 I want to, in most people know that story by now.
02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:06.000 I do give some behind the scenes never before heard elements to that story.
02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.000 Yeah, it's good detail.
02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000 Which way you got to read the book.
02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:14.000 But why is that in the shame chapters?
02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000 The question, I think.
02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:19.000 I want to hear your perspective on that whole thing too.
02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000 First, because you told me a minute ago.
02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000 Yeah, you know, from my perspective, it looked like this.
02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000 Like this is just be clear, like during the election, when it all happened.
02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:29.000 Because I was on your show last time well before, or never ever happened.
02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.000 No one knew who Dan Crenshaw was back then.
02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:40.000 When you first came on, when you first came on, no one really, you, you, you, you just started your character.
02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.000 That was early.
02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000 And yeah, so it was early.
02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:49.000 But now all the sudden man overnight, everybody knew who you were because of this.
02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:52.000 And what happened was, from my perspective,
02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:56.000 was people people started hitting me up on social media like,
02:06:56.000 --> 02:07:02.000 Are you gonna, you know, denounce Saturday live?
02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000 And, you know, what did you think of this?
02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000 And then they put the little thing in there.
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:09.000 And, you know, of course, my kind of gut was like kind of funny.
02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:13.000 You know, I was like, like my response was like, kind of funny.
02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000 I don't know that that made me laugh.
02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000 But here's the thing.
02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000 Luckily for me, I'm always behind on Twitter.
02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000 Like I'm not quite caught up.
02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:25.000 And as I finally started what I was like, okay, I'm gonna respond to this right around then.
02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.000 And I was like, man, what do I, I'm like thinking of myself.
02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:32.000 I don't think Dan is like crying over this.
02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000 I don't think he's at home going.
02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:37.000 I can't believe that some comedian made fun of me.
02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000 Like, I'm thinking of it.
02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:42.000 But people are acting as if you were outraged.
02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000 They were outraged for you.
02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:45.000 And, you know, God bless him.
02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000 It wasn't like they were bad people.
02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000 They were just offended by it, right?
02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000 What we do now.
02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000 Yeah, they were offended by it.
02:07:53.000 --> 02:08:01.000 And like you and I both know, I'm like, hey, man, that's something that probably has been said to him a hundred times in a platoon space somewhere.
02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000 You know, like they're gonna make fun of you for everything.
02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:10.000 So anyways, when I finally responded, it was like, I think Dan can handle himself or something.
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:15.000 And I quoted you saying, hey, whatever your thing was like, hey, I'm not outraged.
02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:16.000 It's fine.
02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:20.000 He's literally a comedian in one to get on use the term literally in its right.
02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000 The guy is literally a comedian.
02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:25.000 He's supposed to make fun of things and make people laugh.
02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000 He's not doing political commentary.
02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:31.000 And it's not a personal attack on you for just him.
02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000 Just to attack you as a human being.
02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000 He's trying to make people laugh.
02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:38.000 So that wasn't kind of my perspective.
02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:44.000 It's funny how like when you're in a position like you are and I am in, you know, people like they hit you up on social media.
02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:48.000 It's almost like this challenging like you better do this or I'll never, never like you again.
02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:51.000 Or if you don't do what they want, I like to.
02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:55.000 But now I can't trust you anymore.
02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:56.000 It's just funny how that works.
02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.000 So that's one element of it.
02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:02.000 But the, yeah, the hit me on an apporno thing was pretty funny.
02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000 Like that was, that is no idea.
02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.000 I don't think that even pissed off anybody to be honest.
02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:11.000 It was the, it was the, the next comment, which was,
02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:14.000 Yeah, I mean it was very dismissive.
02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.000 It was actually the whatever.
02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.000 Yeah, yeah, exactly.
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.000 It was actually the whatever.
02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.000 Yeah, yeah, if he hadn't said that, he wouldn't have received any backlash.
02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.000 If he would have said, I'm sorry, I know he lost his dying war.
02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.000 It would have been like that.
02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:25.000 You know what?
02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:26.000 Okay, cool.
02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:27.000 Yeah.
02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:28.000 And then he said, or whatever.
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.000 Right, right.
02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000 And it was a very dismissive tone.
02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.000 And now, okay, so why is that in that chapter?
02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.000 And it's because of this.
02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:50.000 So the point is, is that the Saturday night live story was a story fundamentally about showing the right sense of shame and reaction to that.
02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000 So because it could have gone a lot different.
02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.000 Like I could have asked Jaco to be like denounced them for me.
02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000 And they're like, okay, fine, Dan, Jay.
02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.000 God, being kind of a bitch by the way.
02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.000 And I could have actually stoked the outrage and just like played the agreed victim.
02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.000 And by the way, if you read left wing media these days, they'll say that's all the things I did.
02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000 It's actually absurd how they rewrite history.
02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000 Oh, 100%.
02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000 It's insane.
02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.000 Like the lies that occur from left wing media or don't give me started.
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000 I already started.
02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.000 But okay, so that's not what happened.
02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000 Right?
02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:31.000 I was like, my line was something along the lines of like, you know, in this life, like try or not to offend people, but also try really hard not to be offended.
02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:34.000 So, you know, it's kind of sucks what he said.
02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:39.000 But now I'm not going to ask for him to be denounced or I don't want him to demanding an apology.
02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000 Be careful not to demand an apology.
02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:42.000 I don't care if they apologize.
02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000 It's like my life goes on either way.
02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.000 That's sort of how I stated that.
02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000 And no, he shouldn't be fired.
02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000 People ask me like, should be fired.
02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000 Like no, like why, you know?
02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:57.000 And I'm remembering now you also said something along the lines of look.
02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.000 I'm not really offended, but you may have offended other people.
02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:03.000 Like you, you kind of took a stance for other vets that have been wounded especially now.
02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000 Is it been more grievously wounded than you?
02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:11.000 That was the important line I had to walk on that entire reaction.
02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.000 Because that's legitimate totally.
02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:17.000 You can't kind of, you can't forgive the guy right off the bat.
02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:20.000 You have to acknowledge that he was screwed up.
02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:27.000 And, um, but on the other hand, you can also acknowledge that that he may have made a mistake.
02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000 Like he may have mispoke.
02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000 Like it may have been sort of ad libbed.
02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:36.000 You know, because that is a very highly scripted show, but after working with Pete Davidson,
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:39.000 like he kind of goes off the rails sometimes.
02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000 And, uh, I mean, on the show or on the show.
02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:42.000 In life, both.
02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:43.000 Okay.
02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:44.000 Obviously.
02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:49.000 But, uh, you know, so it's like, you know, always that it's kind of going back to be still like,
02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000 is there a chance that there's more to this story?
02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.000 Um, is there a chance I don't have to act like an agreed victim?
02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:58.000 I don't feel like an agreed victim, so maybe don't act like it.
02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:04.000 And so that gave, that gave SNL the space to invite me on the show.
02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:09.000 If I had really stoked the outrage mob, um, why would they invite me on the show?
02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:12.000 You know, because now now I've put them in a corner.
02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000 And, uh, so you can see this going that way.
02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000 And this is how it usually goes, right?
02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:19.000 This kind of extreme sense of shame must be showed.
02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:27.000 And the extreme sense of, or the extreme outrage results in an extreme sense of shame.
02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:31.000 And so we've miscalabrated how we feel shame in this country.
02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000 And that's a problem for our culture.
02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:40.000 Um, and, and the reason Americans liked the whole SNL moment with me and Pete was because it was the right balance.
02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:45.000 So the right sense of shame is about finding the right balance of shame.
02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000 Because it seems like we have these like two options.
02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:51.000 And I open up that chapter talking about all these politicians who,
02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:56.000 who run headlong into failure and then like reemerge untouched or unrepent.
02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.000 And there's a lot of examples like that, okay?
02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:02.000 And I try to have bipartisan examples by the way.
02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:07.000 Uh, because I did want this to be readable to people of other than, you know, my conservative fan base.
02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:15.000 And, um, and the point is, is that, yeah, those politicians are bad people for basically feeling no shame.
02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:20.000 At the same time, our culture has given them no incentive to feel any shame.
02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:25.000 Because the outrage mob is so severe and so unrelenting and so on for giving.
02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:30.000 That there's no incentive to actually react the way you should react.
02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:35.000 And so you end up just not either not apologizing or apologizing profusely.
02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:43.000 And like I actually, and the book actually, actually analyze this with some bell curves and graphs that I drew.
02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:46.000 It's just like illustrate this visually for people.
02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.000 So you just have to buy the book to see what I'm talking about.
02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:54.000 Um, and what the point is is like, we need to get back to the middle ground where it's like,
02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000 I'm kind of sorry, but I'm not really sorry.
02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000 You know, and there's some good examples of that.
02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000 Like, I used to own the generous as a great example.
02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:05.000 She took all this heat for like, you know, hanging out with George W. Bush at the Dallas Cowboys game.
02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:11.000 She didn't apologize. She wasn't like, you know, I didn't, she could have done like the extreme.
02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:17.000 Apology. I didn't realize how much pain I would cause the LGBTQ community.
02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000 She could have said that, right?
02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:22.000 And you've seen other celebrities do similar things.
02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.000 Like similar apologies. It's like, you've got nothing to apologize for.
02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000 Nothing.
02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:31.000 And she didn't apologize. She just kind of explained it.
02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000 She got to just put people in their place.
02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:37.000 Like, hey, like it's cool to hang out and be friends with people who you disagree with.
02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000 And that was it.
02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:40.000 No, no, I do.
02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:45.000 It was, it was, it was, it was, she diffused the situation rather, um, elegantly.
02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.000 And, um, I used a couple of other examples of some good ones too.
02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.000 But that's what we have to be aspiring to.
02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.000 And, um, and we're not there right now.
02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:58.000 And then it gets into the, the chapter gets into the individual sense of shame.
02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:01.000 Because this is that that's the cultural problem we have.
02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.000 That's the cultural outrage mob problem that I just described.
02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:09.000 But there's a more individualistic sense of shame too about how you carry yourself through your daily life.
02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:15.000 And, um, and how you have to feel bad about something if you're going to live your planet.
02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:18.000 Like you have to know what it is and you have to understand right and wrong.
02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:21.000 You can only understand right and wrong if you understand what you should feel shame about.
02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:30.000 And then I, and I get again into kind of a religious discussion here about like our morality and like how we actually know right from wrong.
02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:36.000 This is, this is a, this is a deep thing to understand and how you should feel bad about certain things.
02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000 If you're going to live the right way.
02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:42.000 And then again, we, we do this meticulously in the seal teams.
02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:47.000 I think I have a story in there about, um, just a debrief from a typical seal chief.
02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:52.000 And how that went. You know, we thought we did good. No, you did it.
02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:55.000 And you're going to feel bad about it.
02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:57.000 And you have to make yourself feel bad about it.
02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:00.000 And that's, that's, that's the, that's the psychological reason.
02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:12.000 The psychological underpinnings of, of this chapter is, is you, a, a seal chief or Jaco can make you,
02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:17.000 make you, no, you can, let, you can let them know that they screwed up right.
02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:20.000 But the question is, do you feel bad about it?
02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:26.000 Most team guys do. Most team guys like it's just, it's hard to, to feel like you screwed up.
02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:30.000 But in the, in the outside world, that's not always the case.
02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:34.000 A lot of people are thinking, whatever, I should be being trouble.
02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:40.000 I was going to say, since I was in a position where a lot of times I was debriefing people and telling them that they screwed something up.
02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:44.000 And the reactions were from a good, this is the difference.
02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:49.000 You said, most team guys, good team guys go, ah man, I screwed that up.
02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:54.000 I got to fix it. Bad team guys go, didn't really matter.
02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000 That wouldn't have, that would never happen real world.
02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000 I would, you know, like they've got a million excuses.
02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000 They don't take ownership of it, and they, and it just falls apart.
02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000 They feel, they feel, no shame.
02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000 Exactly. They feel like, it's not my fault.
02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000 It's, it's not on me.
02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000 And there's a rationalization that occurs.
02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:13.000 And you have to, the only thing you can control is your conscious mind.
02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:19.000 Because you can, you can control the conversation going on in your head about how you rationalize that.
02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:25.000 And the more you rationalize it, the less likely it is that you actually feel the shame in your gut.
02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:28.000 Because because at first you feel it, like you know it was your fault.
02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000 And you feel it, but then you rationalize it away.
02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:35.000 And eventually that rationalization kind of takes over and you no longer even feel the shame in your gut.
02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:38.000 And you're going out of very bad path at that point.
02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:42.000 And again, this, this, this, try to relate this to a very basic stuff in life.
02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:48.000 Like, like, don't you feel bad when you're that guy who kind of leaves the shopping cart in a parking spot?
02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000 Because you should.
02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.000 Yeah.
02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:52.000 You're a bad person.
02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.000 Bad person.
02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.000 You are.
02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:55.000 Find a new one.
02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:56.000 You're a bad person.
02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:57.000 You're a bad person.
02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:58.000 You are.
02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:58.000 You're a bad person.
02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.000 You're a bad person.
02:17:59.000 --> 02:17:59.000 You're a bad person.
02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.000 You're a bad person.
02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000 You're a bad person.
02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000 You're a bad person.
02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.000 You know, you did it.
02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:03.000 Yeah.
02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:04.000 You know, you are.
02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:05.000 You're out there.
02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:06.000 Yeah.
02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:11.000 You say in here, we should feel a sense of shame for not training hard enough for sleeping
02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:14.000 in too late for eating that extra scoop of ice cream.
02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000 We should feel regret after walking by a piece of trash.
02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:19.000 Next to storm drain knowing for where we'll go straight in the ocean.
02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:23.000 We should feel bad for not tipping that hard working waiter.
02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:28.000 We should be embarrassed when we owe a friend money and they have to constantly remind us to pay them back.
02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000 We should.
02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.000 We should.
02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000 We should.
02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:39.000 We should feel lazy for leaving our food tray on the table in a fast food restaurant, even though their trash cans are right there.
02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:40.000 You go on.
02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:45.000 You say we should be insured be accountable for everything you do.
02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:49.000 It was why commander Jocca Willink echo Charles.
02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:53.000 One of my mentors in the teams wrote an entire book on the subject called Extreme Ownership.
02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:55.000 The premise of the book is quite simple.
02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:56.000 Everything is your fault.
02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:57.000 Be accountable.
02:18:57.000 --> 02:18:58.000 Take ownership.
02:18:58.000 --> 02:18:59.000 Take responsibility.
02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:01.000 From this responsibility.
02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.000 You will find freedom.
02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:06.000 It is liberating.
02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:07.000 Really is.
02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:08.000 It's liberating.
02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:14.000 The worst thing is trying to look and find who you're going to blame because then you don't have control over it.
02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:19.000 When you say you know what this is my fault, then you are free to go and make changes in your life.
02:19:19.000 --> 02:19:21.000 Free to fix things.
02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:29.000 It's the deeper discussion about why personal responsibility is a bedrock of our cultural, of our culture and our cultural foundations.
02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:32.000 As a conservative, we always say it.
02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:35.000 I'm always like a personal responsibility.
02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:39.000 In speeches, I try to delve into that a lot deeper.
02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.000 This is the argument for why it matters.
02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000 It's quite simple.
02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.000 Personal responsibility is empowering.
02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.000 And lack of personal responsibility is disempowering.
02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:57.000 The other issue is it's completely unsustainable for a society to engage in a lack of personal responsibility.
02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:04.000 It's unsustainable because by definition, if you're not personally responsible, someone else must be responsible for you.
02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:11.000 And that's fine if you're an infant or you're in the, you know, it's a small segment of society, right?
02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:15.000 You can, you can, again, our, our government tries to take that into account.
02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:24.000 But if you encourage the undermining of the foundation itself, the undermining of personal responsibility as a virtue in and of itself, which is what's happening on the left.
02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:40.000 If you try to undermine that cultural foundation, you're creating an unbelievably unsustainable trajectory, where it is, where we, we have more and more people who are, who are convinced that somebody else should be responsible for them and therefore take their own power.
02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:48.000 It's unbelievably disempowering and it's, it's just, you wouldn't wish that state of mind on anybody except your worst enemies.
02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:51.000 You know, it's, again, it's not how you treat people you love.
02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:55.000 It's one of those things that's tempting, right? It's short-term gratification.
02:20:55.000 --> 02:21:04.000 It's, it seems like the easier way to go because in the short-term, hey, I just got this and I didn't have to work for it.
02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:05.000 Yeah.
02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:06.000 That's the short-term.
02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:11.000 And unfortunately, we know where it ends up.
02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:14.000 It's like a pyramid scheme.
02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:17.000 Think about it.
02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:22.000 I'm thinking of it. I'm getting paid or whatever, because someone got to do the work at the end of the day.
02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:27.000 But a pyramid scheme, it's like everyone's waiting for their turn to like get, get.
02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:27.000 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:30.000 And then at the end of the day, everybody crashes because, oh, who's doing the work?
02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:31.000 No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000 I mean, you can't remember. We're not doing anything.
02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:34.000 That's right.
02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:35.000 I think that that first, second year.
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:36.000 Yeah, that's right.
02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:39.000 My initial thought was trying to put it together, but yeah, you're right.
02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:42.000 Because you're building it on everyone's going to get money.
02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:43.000 Yeah.
02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:44.000 So is the money?
02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:48.000 It's the money coming from. It's basically the diffusion of responsibility.
02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:52.000 This is what you're talking about and sort of the tragedy of the comments as well.
02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000 It's going to be a mix of all those things.
02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000 And it's not good.
02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000 It's unsustainable.
02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:02.000 Next chapter, duty, a sense of duty.
02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:09.000 My parents imbueden me a sense of duty to do that, which has inherent value.
02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:19.000 You go on to say duty is ingrained in the human condition. Our great religious, our great religions are essentially based on a sense of duty to love God and live well.
02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:26.000 We have a duty not only to survive in this world, but to pursue a higher purpose we are here for a reason.
02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:30.000 And living for that purpose is our choice to make.
02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:35.000 It is the path to happiness.
02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:45.000 So again, we're starting to talk about the idea that you're going to find happiness in some short term gratification is not true.
02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:53.000 And this chapter comes right after the sense of shame chapter because you have to understand what is wrong,
02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:56.000 so that you can understand what is right.
02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:02.000 And that is the darkness in the light and you have to live in both.
02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:07.000 And sense of duty is, it's living your plan A.
02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:13.000 You know, and I said, don't live your plan B, no plan B. Again, that, what I explained before that was about purpose.
02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:18.000 That's about living with purpose. And so we get into a lot more detail about what that is in this chapter.
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:25.000 We talk about the great religions. We talk about why that's important.
02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:36.000 And then it's a duty to live in the books about mental toughness. And so we bring it back into it's a duty to live with that fortitude.
02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:41.000 And again, to feel bad, this is deeply intertwined with the sense of shame, to feel bad when you don't.
02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:45.000 To understand what that duty is and how to live within it.
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:50.000 And I can't remember if I list the ten commandments in this chapter or the other thing in the different chapter.
02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:53.000 Yeah, but it's the same kind of discussion.
02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:56.000 Oh, no, right. It is this chapter. It is this chapter.
02:23:56.000 --> 02:24:04.000 So then it's so that's when I get into a really long discussion about where our laws come from.
02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:07.000 So this kind of goes into political philosophy as well.
02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:14.000 And the fact is, is that the ten commandments are the origins of our law.
02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:18.000 And I talk about how Moses, the portrait of Moses, is in the house of representative,
02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:23.000 and the figure of the house. And along with 23 other law givers, but Moses is in the middle.
02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:30.000 Moses is the only one who's not inside profile. That's important because he was the original receiver of law.
02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:34.000 Not man made law, but like absolute law. These things are true.
02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:37.000 Can't be argued with there. Just true.
02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:41.000 All right. Like the commandments one through four basically say, these are true.
02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000 You can't argue with them. Like believe in God.
02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:46.000 And the rest of them are like, this is what you should do.
02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:49.000 And don't steal, don't kill, all that.
02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:52.000 And an atheist could say, I know that.
02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:57.000 Yeah, I don't need the Bible to tell me that I shouldn't do these things.
02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:01.000 I know they're true. My counter to that is how do you know?
02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:05.000 How do you know? I could tell you who taught them.
02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.000 Where did they get them from? How do you know they're true?
02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000 And they can't answer that.
02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.000 They're true because they do come from a higher power.
02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:17.000 They're true because they come from thousands of years of wisdom.
02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.000 And whether you believe in that higher power or not, you're still following it.
02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:23.000 And you can't escape that reality.
02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:29.000 If you try to, and if you start to believe that that human morality is changeable,
02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:34.000 and that we can just choose that to change some of those commandments.
02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:38.000 Well, then you get the Holocaust. Like it's a short path, man.
02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:41.000 Like it's a short path to the horrors of the 20th century.
02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:46.000 The secularism of the 20th century killed millions, tens and tens of millions.
02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:51.000 And because we untethered ourselves from absolute morality.
02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:54.000 It's a really dangerous path.
02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:59.000 Yeah, when you talk about that and you end up saying at a very basic level,
02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:01.000 this is back to book at a very basic level.
02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:05.000 This is a shirking of fundamental human duty and responsibility,
02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:11.000 a responsibility to what exactly, politeness, open-mindedness and grace for starters.
02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:14.000 These are our duties to our fellow Americans.
02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:15.000 Just the basics.
02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:19.000 If we lose those fundamental virtues, we lose our sense of unity.
02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:23.000 Without a sense of unity under unumbrella of common values,
02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:27.000 this whole great American experiment unravels.
02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:30.000 And as you just said, we've seen this before.
02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:34.000 Common values, exactly, and they come from somewhere.
02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.000 A large part of this book is about showing gratitude for your history.
02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000 Gratitude for what works.
02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:46.000 I like to say that, again, just being a conservative conservatism is based fundamentally on things that work.
02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:49.000 Not things that feel good, but things that work.
02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.000 And that's important. You know, doesn't mean we're always right,
02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.000 but most of the time, I think, at least the foundations are.
02:26:55.000 --> 02:27:00.000 And you can't just undermine the foundations of a society.
02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:04.000 And see that happening more and more, unfortunately.
02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:08.000 You rattle off some of these duties. You have a duty to accomplish something every day.
02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.000 You have a duty to live up to yourself, the person you want to be,
02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000 the hero archetype you admire.
02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000 You have a duty to embrace shame and learn from it.
02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000 You have a duty to be polite, thoughtful, patient.
02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:20.000 You have a duty to overcome your hardships and not wallowing self-pity.
02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000 You have a duty to contribute.
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000 Even if your contribution is small, you have a duty to be on time.
02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000 You have a duty to do your job.
02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:30.000 Even if your job sucks, you have a duty to stay healthy both for yourself.
02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:33.000 And so you do, so that you do not become a burden on others.
02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:36.000 You have a duty to be part of the solution, not the problem.
02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000 In other words, don't join the Twitter mob.
02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:43.000 You have a duty to try hard not to offend others and try harder not to be offended.
02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000 And this is where you start broaching into what I was saying earlier.
02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:51.000 There is a selfish reason to live a life of purpose and responsibility.
02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:54.000 It will make you tougher and more successful.
02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:58.000 We are perfect and we won't always adhere to these basic duties.
02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:03.000 But I hope we can start to agree on what they are, feel some shame and we fall short,
02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000 and begin living our lives with purpose.
02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:10.000 This is the time-tested formula for stronger people and more than that, a stronger America.
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000 This is what people miss sometimes.
02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:15.000 And I talk about this a lot from a leadership perspective.
02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:20.000 From a leadership perspective, if I'm a leader that tries to climb on people's back,
02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:25.000 tries to make myself look good, tries to always shine the line line on myself
02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000 and find the best deal for myself.
02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:31.000 If on that type of leader, I might get ahead for a second here there,
02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:34.000 but ultimately I will not be in charge of anything.
02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:39.000 If you're the type of leader that takes care of your troops, looks out for the good of the mission.
02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000 You look out for everyone above yourself.
02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:49.000 If you're that type of leader, look, you might take hits now and again because you're propping up everyone else above yourself.
02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:53.000 But in the long run, this is the amazing thing.
02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:59.000 In the long run, you will absolutely be a more successful leader than me who's over here looking out for myself.
02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:04.000 And that's a similar thing to what you're saying here, which is like if you do these things,
02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:10.000 which seem like sometimes they be a pain, getting up every day and being on time, taking care of your health.
02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000 Like all these things, maybe you don't feel being polite to people.
02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:15.000 Sometimes you just want to do what I want to do.
02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:21.000 That ultimately taking care of yourself and putting yourself as the supreme cause of your life.
02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:26.000 Ultimately, you will be less successful than if you take care of other people.
02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:33.000 If you treat other people with respect, if you do your job, if you do those things that again on the surface,
02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:38.000 they seem like they might not help you in the long run, you will absolutely win.
02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.000 Absolutely.
02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:44.000 And when you win, your team wins, your community wins, your country wins.
02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000 That's what happens.
02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.000 Right.
02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:52.000 And your individual actions and habits and tasks that are inherently good.
02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:56.000 We have to, again, we have to redefine what good is because we've forgotten.
02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:00.000 But that makes up the fabric of the larger culture.
02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:09.000 And if we want a successful culture that is not at each other's throats and not losing our minds because of microaggressions and offenses,
02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:17.000 then you've got to live within that. And yeah, treating other people to respect and doing things for others, again,
02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:27.000 very basic biblical teachings that are unfortunately being swept away, especially in favor of a kind of the sense of grandstanding and sense of morality,
02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:32.000 where it's more moral to demand that others do something for others.
02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:35.000 You know, like that's, again, going back to the problems with socialism.
02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:40.000 It seems to me that, because some socialists will sometimes say, well, Jesus was a socialist.
02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:44.000 Now, Jesus encouraged you to be charitable with your time and your money.
02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:45.000 Right.
02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:46.000 That's what Jesus said.
02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:52.000 He didn't say, stand on top of the hill, screaming that other people give away their money.
02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000 That's not, sorry.
02:30:54.000 --> 02:31:02.000 That's just, you're missing deliberately misinterpreting the teachings of the Bible in favor of socialism.
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:09.000 There's a few other biblical reasons, I think socialism is not correct, but for our purposes on this chapter, that's a big one.
02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:14.000 Sense of duty to give your time and your money and contribute that way.
02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:22.000 And it will make you more successful in the long run, because building good relationships is a huge part of success.
02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000 We forget about that sometimes.
02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:32.000 I've drawn Peter's, it goes into a lot of detail in that particular element, which is fascinating to get an easy, big fan.
02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:35.000 And is he been on your show?
02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:36.000 Three times.
02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:44.000 He was on before he was on before he was kind of popular before 12 rules for life came out.
02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:47.000 And then he was on two times after that.
02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:53.000 And yeah, there are some of the most popular episodes of the podcast.
02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:54.000 Until this one, of course.
02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:55.000 Yeah.
02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:56.000 Sure.
02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:57.000 Yeah.
02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:58.000 I'm sure.
02:31:58.000 --> 02:31:59.000 100%.
02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:00.000 Yeah.
02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000 It's interesting because a lot of people, they make that mistake.
02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:05.000 How you're like, you have to have to do it.
02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:08.000 Because people make that mistake with extreme ownership too.
02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:09.000 Yeah.
02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:10.000 Yeah.
02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:13.000 But they're like, hey, if my boss would just get on board with this concept, you know, like, yeah,
02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000 that would be problems with my team would just take ownership.
02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:16.000 Yeah.
02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:17.000 We're not talking about the same field.
02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000 And same thing with relationships.
02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:25.000 And I've been using the percentage lately of 99.9% of the things that I got done in the military.
02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:29.000 And did in the military were based on relationships and not based on chain of command.
02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:34.000 So every time one of my guys, you know, had a mission, I didn't, this is how you're going to do it.
02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000 And I was like, hey, how do you want to get this done?
02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:39.000 Every time my boss came to me, they want to like, hey, John, this is what you need to do.
02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000 And they're like, hey, here's what we got.
02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:42.000 What do you think?
02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000 Everything was about relationships.
02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:53.000 Every, every, the extreme examples in the battle of Ramadi when we needed fire support from tanks who needed to risk their lives to go and get my guys,
02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000 prevent them from being overrun in the field.
02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000 Well, those tanks didn't work for me.
02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000 They didn't, they weren't totally separate chain of command.
02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000 And yet they would do it. Why?
02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:05.000 Because we had awesome relationships up and down the chain of command.
02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:12.000 And so yeah, absolutely relationship building is, it's, it's critical to every aspect of life.
02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:17.000 And the little tagline that I often tell people is relationships are stronger than the chain of command.
02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:18.000 100%.
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:18.000 Yeah.
02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:19.000 100%.
02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000 Next chapter.
02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:24.000 Do something hard.
02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:27.000 In Buds, it's all about the next 10 minutes.
02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000 Sometimes it's about the next 30 seconds.
02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:34.000 If you're thinking about Buds in its entirety, six brutal months, then the thought is simply too much.
02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:39.000 The men who quit are the men who look up at the day before them and see all the days to come.
02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000 They are thinking, they're the men who are miserable.
02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:46.000 And what end called and thinking about the hot coffee and the girlfriend they miss.
02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:52.000 And suddenly, because they imagine the months long suffering, they will inevitably face they break.
02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:58.000 They are already using every ounce of endurance and fortitude to survive what's happening right now.
02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:03.000 Expanding their horizons to an infinite number of miserable right nows.
02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:06.000 Does them in.
02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:12.000 So you focus on the next 10 minutes and remind yourself that the instructors can't kill you even if they're claiming otherwise.
02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000 Thousands have made it before you.
02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:15.000 You can too.
02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:20.000 What's on the other side of those months and months of 10 minute blocks are over.
02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:24.000 Liberation transformation and meaning.
02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:27.000 So that's.
02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:30.000 That's one way to get through Buds.
02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000 Buds isn't six months long.
02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000 It's about four minutes long.
02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:35.000 Right now.
02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:36.000 I want to get through it.
02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000 Lots of four minutes.
02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.000 Lots and lots of them.
02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:44.000 Or some longer for some of us if we extend our time by breaking a leg.
02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:48.000 Some just not great, but also normal.
02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:49.000 Yeah, normal.
02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000 A lot of people get rolled back.
02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:54.000 They got to go back over and over again.
02:34:54.000 --> 02:35:01.000 So how does this, how does this apply then to, you know, this is broad advice to human beings.
02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:02.000 Yeah.
02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:07.000 So because I have everybody's going through Buds and Norshad Day.
02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:11.000 And obviously, I'm using my own experiences here.
02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000 Like this was my transformation.
02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:16.000 Buds is a transformation for a lot of seals.
02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:24.000 It's what gives us confidence and you push your limits so that you way pass what you thought were there.
02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:29.000 So that your confidence enough to break past more limits when they come because they will come.
02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:33.000 And, you know, they came for me getting blown up.
02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:37.000 That was a limit that I didn't quite experience even in Hellweek.
02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:41.000 And it got worse because things can get worse.
02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:50.000 But Hellweek and Buds in general and the mentality that we developed, accordingly, at least allowed me to deal with it later.
02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:56.000 And so doing something hard, it has a number of benefits.
02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:00.000 One is kind of a simple sense of preparedness.
02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:05.000 And the Stoics, a reference Stoics, Stoicism a lot throughout the book.
02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:13.000 And the Stoics are referenced in this one because they, they believed in hardship as preparedness.
02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:20.000 So that's a very, that's a very practical reason to just do hard stuff.
02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:25.000 You know, if you're worried about being homeless one day, try to sit on the floor sometimes.
02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:31.000 Like, try going a few days without the comforts of your home so that if it did happen, you'd actually be prepared for it.
02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:37.000 That's a very simplistic way of looking at it, but like that's what they meant by that simple preparedness.
02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:45.000 You know, if you want to be better at running up a mountain, run up a mountain like, you know, so the actor preparedness.
02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:49.000 But there's a deeper reason why I think doing something hard matters.
02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:52.000 And it's the, it's the psychology of suffering.
02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:57.000 And so this is a chapter that has a lot of psych references in it.
02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:04.000 I did a lot of research on this one specifically with kind of Dr. Allison from University of Richmond.
02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:08.000 And the benefits of suffering are well documented.
02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:12.000 Psychologically and physiological, physiologically speaking.
02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:17.000 Interesting research that I, and we'll go into now, but because again, I want people to read it.
02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:20.000 And all of the people who come away from this podcast, but check, got it.
02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:24.000 You know, not buying that book now. Thanks, Jocco.
02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:31.000 So there's a lot more to it, but the suffering has inherent value.
02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:37.000 And we've, we've created the society where we try to avoid suffering and risk at all costs.
02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:40.000 And there's, it's not self-evident that that's a good thing.
02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000 In fact, it's pretty evident that it's a bad thing.
02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000 We've become more fragile as a result.
02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:49.000 And again, there's good research that shows like we've become kind of this,
02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:52.000 this fragile culture. We need to be anti-fragile.
02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:58.000 Heartship should make us stronger, not just that we're resilient to it, but that it actually makes us stronger.
02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:01.000 This is fundamentally true.
02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:06.000 Again, I think the, the Bible talks about this, the, or psychological research talks about this.
02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:13.000 There's, there's evidence that, you know, again, physiological pain, you know, working out.
02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:17.000 It changes your brain. It makes you better at memory.
02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:21.000 And if you're better at, like, if your brain works better, I would argue that you're mentally tougher.
02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:25.000 So like, just, again, so start lifting weights, you know?
02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:28.000 And if you can't lift weights, like, find something else that is hard.
02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:29.000 So again, it's not buds.
02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:34.000 And I'm not saying, lift or trauma either, okay? Like swimming with sharks is hard.
02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:37.000 Like, don't go swim with sharks. That's bad.
02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:45.000 But, and, like, so I guess what I'm saying is, don't put yourself in a dangerous situation
02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:48.000 where you'll have to live through a hardship and then overcome it.
02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:51.000 Okay? That's not what I'm saying.
02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:54.000 I am saying it has to be self-imposed and it has to be habitual.
02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:56.000 And there's value in that.
02:38:56.000 --> 02:39:00.000 And it could be simple, right? It could be taking a cold shower on weekends.
02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:03.000 Like, I'm just going to, on weekends, I'm going to take cold showers.
02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000 It could be waking up at 4.30 a.m.
02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:06.000 Sorry.
02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:06.000 I could play.
02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.000 Yeah. I hate that plan.
02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:12.000 But, but that's, that's like, but that's, there's a reason you do it, you know,
02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:17.000 and, and for the sense of discipline, you're on the path. Like, this is, this is what you do.
02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:20.000 And it's different for everybody, but just find it.
02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:23.000 And maybe make it harder the next time, you know?
02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:26.000 But eventually, in your case, you would just be, never, I guess,
02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000 what would that look like wake up earlier?
02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.000 No sleep.
02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:30.000 Now you're just in the middle of the night.
02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:33.000 You're just like, you know, it's weird.
02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:40.000 I'm thinking about, um, there'd be sometimes with team guys on operations
02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:47.000 where it goes, it goes past the normal everyday level of suck.
02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000 Like, it starts to suck bad.
02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:53.000 Whatever it is, whether it's a long, long insert, you know,
02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:58.000 patrol in, whether it's the heat, whether it's the cold, whatever that thing is,
02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:03.000 like, you will be, uh, I would say, one out of every eight,
02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:08.000 just standard kind of operations that you're going, one out of every eight.
02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:13.000 You're going to have to go into that zone where you look around at the other guys
02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000 and you're like, yeah, you're like, you know, like, you're up.
02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:21.000 This, everyone right here, everybody in this boat in this Zodiac,
02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000 that is absolutely freezing right now.
02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000 This sucks for everybody.
02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000 And you know what, it's just like, you're up.
02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:28.000 We're going to keep going.
02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000 And it's like glorious.
02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:33.000 And then you look back on it later and you're like, that was amazing.
02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000 And it makes you better.
02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:40.000 And it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, it, really, there's a spiritual awakening that occurs with suffering,
02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:41.000 self-imposed suffering.
02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:42.000 No doubt.
02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:45.000 And, um, and, um, and, um, and also not self-imposed suffering.
02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:51.000 I'm just saying, don't go seek out the, the, you know, what would be better to refer to as tragedy.
02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000 But yeah, I'm not saying seek out for tragedy.
02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:57.000 But also, now, kind of, I would be jumping into the next chapter,
02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:58.000 because sort of leads into it.
02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:02.000 But then you're telling yourself a story about the tragedy.
02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:06.000 And there's still value in that. And again, this is backed up by research.
02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000 Like, it, it did my homework on this.
02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:11.000 There is, it, whether you call it post-traumatic growth,
02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:14.000 or, or, or kind of positive, I forget the other terms.
02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:17.000 But there's, there's a, there's a bunch of terms, like a lot of psychology terms that,
02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:20.000 that, that, that prove and, and demonstrate that people,
02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:27.000 not only become more resilient, but, but even stronger after really hard occurrences.
02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:30.000 So don't run from it as a society we need to embrace it.
02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:34.000 Yeah, I, no, no doubt in my mind. And we'll, let's jump to the next chapter.
02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:37.000 But first, let me close this one out, because it's,
02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000 here's what you say.
02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:45.000 In the raw humanistic sense, without suffering, there can be no internal resilience to adversity.
02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:48.000 No proper preparedness for the future.
02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:54.000 Suffering controlled by you and for the right cause can be a building block for both spiritual,
02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:55.000 health and mental toughness.
02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:58.000 In a liberty-based nation like the United States,
02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:06.000 we are free to fail and to suffer that fortitude is a welcome and necessary attribute.
02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:10.000 Rather than trying to erase suffering at every opportunity,
02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:15.000 we would all be wise to value it and seek it out.
02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:20.000 So go do something hard.
02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:24.000 And so this next chapter, which you are just alluding to,
02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:28.000 is called the stories we tell ourselves.
02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:33.000 You say, you could tell the story of my life as a succession of hard times and heavy burdens.
02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:39.000 You could tell it as an array of kicks to the head, interspersed with failures.
02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:44.000 My mom died, my leg broke, my eye got blown out, my active commission got taken away,
02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:47.000 my fellowship application got denied.
02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:50.000 All these things are factually accurate.
02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000 They happened, I endured them.
02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:55.000 That is where a lot of people would leave it.
02:42:55.000 --> 02:43:00.000 These are things that happened to them from forces beyond their control,
02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:05.000 leaving it here, leaving it there communicates a handful of ideas about someone.
02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:10.000 He's unfortunate, he's unlucky, he's beaten, he's evictum.
02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:13.000 That is not where people should leave it.
02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:18.000 Stories about burdens born on their own omit the most important parts,
02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:21.000 the responsibility of the individual.
02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:27.000 The reaction of the individual, the growth and maturing of the individual.
02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:31.000 The world does something to you because it will always do something to you,
02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:37.000 but once it's done, that share of the story is over.
02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:40.000 That is where your share of the story begins.
02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:50.000 That's the point where the story stops being something done to you and starts being about you.
02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:54.000 You go into, we talked about your mom dying, but you mentioned your leg,
02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:55.000 you get in bloom.
02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:58.000 There's a lot of things that you have a lot of what do you call him.
02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:02.000 Hard times heavy burdens and failures that you talk about in the book that we haven't even touched.
02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:09.000 Again, that's why people get the books that they can learn those lessons and see what you went through there.
02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:13.000 But also see this, this is now getting towards the end of the book.
02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:16.000 When you're starting to tie this stuff together and say, hey listen,
02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:20.000 you were in a bad situation.
02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:25.000 What are you going to do in the face of those bad situations more poignantly?
02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:28.000 What is the story that you tell yourself?
02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:35.000 Yeah, and in turn throughout this book is a particular thread about victimhood ideology.
02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000 And how that pertains to outraged culture.
02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:44.000 I would argue that victimhood ideology is a tenant of outraged culture.
02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:53.000 It's not surprising that you feel really mad and offended and angry and outraged if you also feel like you're oppressed.
02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:57.000 If you also feel like you're a victim and you embrace that victimhood.
02:44:57.000 --> 02:45:00.000 This isn't all that surprising either.
02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:05.000 It's expected because going back to the hero archetypes, we've elevated victims.
02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:13.000 Why would Jesse Smallet pretend and make up the story that he got attacked by two maga hat wearing guys and Chicago at 2am?
02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000 Why would he make that up?
02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:19.000 Because we've elevated victims to heroes.
02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:28.000 Like that's why why does Elizabeth Warren claim the lies that she's claimed about being Native American or that she was fired for being pregnant?
02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:31.000 These are lies. They're well documented lies.
02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:35.000 You know what's interesting is I'm just thinking of the, what's it?
02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:36.000 Is it Jesse?
02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:37.000 Jesse.
02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000 I'm thinking about that guy's story.
02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:47.000 If you were to go back 20 years and someone was going to make up a story, the story that they would make up would be,
02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:51.000 I got attacked by two guys and I kicked their ass.
02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:52.000 Yes.
02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000 That's really important to me.
02:45:54.000 --> 02:45:55.000 It's crazy.
02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000 The way I, but that's exactly what I'm talking about.
02:45:57.000 --> 02:46:08.000 It's like that's our hero archetypes have shifted so wildly that the more likable story is getting your ass kicked and then complaining about it.
02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:11.000 As opposed to like, no, I just whip their ass.
02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:19.000 That's a perfect point to make and like, that's why I start the book with who is your hero because it's such an important concept.
02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:24.000 And in this case, it's like, can I let you know who your hero is?
02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000 Well, then you should identify how you react to hardship.
02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000 Not saying hardship doesn't exist.
02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:33.000 You know, when I bash victimhood ideology, I'm not saying there are no victims.
02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:36.000 It is possible that you truly are a victim.
02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:38.000 Absolutely.
02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:47.000 But, you know, but one that should be defined, like in just the word injustice needs to be defined better so that we can overcome outrage culture.
02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:51.000 And in just this doesn't mean things that aren't fair or things that you don't like.
02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:54.000 Unfortunately, that's how the word is used all too often.
02:46:54.000 --> 02:46:58.000 And just this means someone else is truly infringing on your rights.
02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:01.000 Rights defined as life liberty and property.
02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:06.000 And justice can be defined as is as is as you're due process being taken away.
02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:10.000 Something some true unfairness or discrimination being implemented against you.
02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:14.000 That can be defined as injustice, okay?
02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:19.000 An outcome based on something other than your merit can be defined as an injustice.
02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:25.000 But, but victimhood ideology really turns these, it really strains these definitions.
02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000 And I think people understand, know this intuitively.
02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:30.000 Just watch the news and watch how people are reacting on social media.
02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:35.000 This is a really big problem that prevents us from telling the right stories about injustice.
02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:38.000 And then solving it and overcoming it.
02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:44.000 We've been encouraged to live in the story of victimhood when something bad happens.
02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:48.000 And that may feel good, again, it goes back to what you're saying before.
02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:53.000 This sort of short term thinking, it feels good in the short term, right?
02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:56.000 It feels like it's somebody else's fault.
02:47:56.000 --> 02:48:00.000 And there's a comfort in that. There's like a warm blanket of self-pity that occurs.
02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:01.000 Like that.
02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:12.000 But it's also, it's, it's, you could almost say quite literally killing you because it leads you down this path of despair that ends in not a good place.
02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:19.000 If you always feel this, your things are out of your control and your disempower and it literally cannot get better.
02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:20.000 You cannot get better.
02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:24.000 One of the questions that I get asked a lot when working with companies.
02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:29.000 They'll say, you know, what's the biggest obstacle for having a culture of extreme ownership?
02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:36.000 And it's really easy answer. The answer is that it is ego because when something goes wrong and you have to say,
02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:41.000 Hey, this is my fault. Well, that hurts your ego.
02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:45.000 And that's the biggest thing that people have to overcome.
02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:49.000 Now, the other thing that that's interesting is, and you address this here.
02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:52.000 So the other, the other question I'll get asked a lot when it comes to extreme ownership.
02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:59.000 And I've kind of already mentioned it. You know, is, hey, if my kid gets sick, how do I take ownership of that?
02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:02.000 If I get cancer, how do I take ownership of that?
02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:06.000 If the market falls apart and we lose all of the money, I have to let people go,
02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:09.000 how do I take ownership of the, of the market?
02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:12.000 How do I take ownership of a natural disaster that occurred, right?
02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:16.000 So there's, get, I get asked that question.
02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:21.000 And the response is, you take ownership of how you,
02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:26.000 how you respond to that occurring, right? When something bad happens.
02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:30.000 And you, you, you, you go through the same thing here.
02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:36.000 You say, even if I was not totally responsible for what happened,
02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:40.000 I was still responsible for what would happen.
02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:44.000 And this is after you got, after you got removed from the Navy.
02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:48.000 Then they, they, they, they didn't kick you out of what they forced you to retire, right?
02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000 Yeah. They forced you retire. Look.
02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:54.000 That, that, that's, that's just happening to you.
02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:57.000 Like the big blue Navy is going, you're done.
02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000 Yep. And you can't control it.
02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:02.000 And so how do you take ownership of that?
02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:05.000 You, you take ownership by how you respond to that.
02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:09.000 And what you say is you, trying to find your next mission.
02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:12.000 Right. You can control the next step.
02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:16.000 There's another important point here that I, that I lay out,
02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:20.000 which is the way you describe your history.
02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:24.000 This is important is putting yourself in the right psychological framework.
02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:27.000 And we call those get to statements.
02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:31.000 Like, I have to wear an eye patch or I get to wear an eye patch.
02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000 You know, because it looks cool.
02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000 So that's nice.
02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000 All right, get to wear the gold tried and tie.
02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000 Because it looks cool.
02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000 But you can go much deeper than that.
02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:45.000 Like, I, you know, in, in some of the, to an extent,
02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000 this is self deception, right?
02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:50.000 And, and you know that consciously going, going into it.
02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:53.000 Like, in, because I use another example, like, well,
02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:57.000 I, I have to pay my bills or get to pay my bills.
02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000 Because it shows that I'm an adult.
02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000 And I'm living responsibly.
02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:05.000 I have to pay taxes or I get to pay taxes.
02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:06.000 That one's harder.
02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:07.000 That one's staying.
02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:08.000 That one's staying.
02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:09.000 Especially if living California.
02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:10.000 Yeah.
02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000 You guys all you do is pay taxes.
02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:13.000 Yes, we do.
02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000 Well, you don't pay taxes.
02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000 And they're not even synchronizing the lights.
02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:21.000 Because if you get to pay taxes, that means that you've made enough money.
02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:21.000 Yeah.
02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:22.000 To pay taxes.
02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:23.000 So it's like, yeah.
02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:23.000 It's like one way to do it.
02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:26.000 And in a, in a, in a, in a different country, by the way.
02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:27.000 Yeah.
02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:31.000 I mean, it, it's, you know, fundamentally what you're doing there is finding the silver lining.
02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:35.000 Because the finding the silver lining in a bad situation is fundamentally
02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:38.000 about telling yourself a different story about that situation.
02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:41.000 And so it's, it's not whistling past the graveyard.
02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:46.000 If you already know it's not ignoring the actual hardship,
02:51:46.20 --> 02:51:49.16 it's just forcing yourself to have the fortitude
02:51:49.16 --> 02:51:51.52 to tell yourself the right story about it.
02:51:51.52 --> 02:51:55.44 That's what the chapter is fundamentally about.
02:51:55.44 --> 02:51:59.000 Yeah, it's one of those things.
02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:00.76 You read through it and you go,
02:52:01.96 --> 02:52:05.52 yeah, this is the attitude that you would want a kid to have.
02:52:05.52 --> 02:52:07.28 You know, you close it out here 20 years ago,
02:52:07.28 --> 02:52:09.72 I received a letter in the mail from Rice University.
02:52:09.72 --> 02:52:11.04 The letter might as well have been addressed,
02:52:11.04 --> 02:52:14.36 dear failure, because it was indeed a letter informing me
02:52:14.36 --> 02:52:15.92 that my services were not required
02:52:15.92 --> 02:52:17.20 at the prestigious school.
02:52:17.20 --> 02:52:18.88 I failed to get in.
02:52:18.88 --> 02:52:21.32 20 years later, I became the US congressman
02:52:21.32 --> 02:52:24.68 who represents Rice University.
02:52:24.68 --> 02:52:28.16 The path from that failure to my present day success
02:52:28.16 --> 02:52:29.60 was not an easy one.
02:52:29.60 --> 02:52:32.08 Many more obstacles and failures would present themselves.
02:52:32.08 --> 02:52:35.76 Every day each against a small obstacle,
02:52:35.76 --> 02:52:38.92 against each small obstacle, I had to tell the right story
02:52:38.92 --> 02:52:43.000 in order to stay on the path through self fulfillment.
02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:48.000 Failure like suffering has intrinsic value and worth
02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.72 should we choose to confront it properly?
02:52:51.64 --> 02:52:54.36 Otherwise, the ultimate story of success,
02:52:54.36 --> 02:52:59.000 whatever that may be for you will never get told.
02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:03.84 The other element here, I don't go into that much detail,
02:53:03.84 --> 02:53:06.68 but it's an answer I give when,
02:53:06.68 --> 02:53:10.48 especially kids ask how to deal with hardship.
02:53:10.48 --> 02:53:14.04 And I like to point out that every obstacle is an opportunity.
02:53:14.04 --> 02:53:15.40 And that sounds kind of cliche,
02:53:15.40 --> 02:53:17.48 but it's really not, it's true.
02:53:17.48 --> 02:53:20.68 I wouldn't be a congressman if I hadn't gotten my eye blown out.
02:53:20.68 --> 02:53:21.52 This is true.
02:53:21.52 --> 02:53:22.76 I would have stayed in the teams.
02:53:22.76 --> 02:53:23.76 I never would have left.
02:53:23.76 --> 02:53:24.88 I had no reason to leave.
02:53:24.88 --> 02:53:26.60 It was not, I thought, very hard not to leave.
02:53:26.60 --> 02:53:27.44 Best job ever.
02:53:27.44 --> 02:53:28.24 Why would you leave?
02:53:28.24 --> 02:53:29.56 Yeah.
02:53:29.56 --> 02:53:33.84 And if I hadn't had been so many things,
02:53:33.84 --> 02:53:38.84 I'd talk about, you know, gotten eye to this cool White House fellowship.
02:53:38.84 --> 02:53:42.08 If I had gotten that, it wouldn't be a congressman.
02:53:42.08 --> 02:53:45.28 You know, so technically that's a failure,
02:53:45.28 --> 02:53:48.68 but, you know, you also, also it's not.
02:53:48.68 --> 02:53:50.72 When did you go for that fellowship?
02:53:50.72 --> 02:53:51.72 Right after Harvard.
02:53:51.72 --> 02:53:52.56 Right after Harvard.
02:53:52.56 --> 02:53:55.52 Or Harvard was right after the Navy for one year,
02:53:55.52 --> 02:53:57.60 applied for that, didn't get it.
02:53:57.60 --> 02:53:59.24 You applied for the White House fellowship?
02:53:59.24 --> 02:54:00.08 Right.
02:54:00.08 --> 02:54:00.72 And you didn't get it.
02:54:00.72 --> 02:54:01.56 Didn't get it.
02:54:01.56 --> 02:54:02.68 And then you're like, okay, cool.
02:54:02.68 --> 02:54:04.36 Can't beat him join him?
02:54:04.36 --> 02:54:05.56 Well, no.
02:54:05.56 --> 02:54:06.84 So, Rand for Congress,
02:54:06.84 --> 02:54:09.28 because now I control the funding for the White House fellowship.
02:54:09.28 --> 02:54:10.12 Yeah.
02:54:10.12 --> 02:54:10.96 Yeah.
02:54:10.96 --> 02:54:12.96 That's right.
02:54:12.96 --> 02:54:13.96 Naval Academy didn't like it.
02:54:13.96 --> 02:54:14.80 I guess it was.
02:54:14.80 --> 02:54:16.24 It actually can't join him beat him.
02:54:16.24 --> 02:54:17.08 I guess it was.
02:54:17.08 --> 02:54:19.28 Yeah, I definitely didn't join them.
02:54:19.28 --> 02:54:20.08 Don't break your go.
02:54:20.08 --> 02:54:21.72 You didn't get it in the Naval Academy either.
02:54:21.72 --> 02:54:22.56 No.
02:54:22.56 --> 02:54:25.000 Didn't get it into the Naval Academy.
02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:26.56 Rejected.
02:54:26.56 --> 02:54:28.76 I'm not going to defund the Naval Academy.
02:54:29.96 --> 02:54:31.04 But.
02:54:31.04 --> 02:54:34.04 But.
02:54:34.04 --> 02:54:35.44 But no, I didn't get in.
02:54:35.44 --> 02:54:36.24 And what if I had?
02:54:36.24 --> 02:54:36.60 I don't know.
02:54:36.60 --> 02:54:38.76 Maybe I wouldn't have even made it to buzz.
02:54:38.76 --> 02:54:40.32 You know, you could argue, you know,
02:54:40.32 --> 02:54:42.12 just different selection process.
02:54:42.12 --> 02:54:43.20 Like there's all these.
02:54:43.20 --> 02:54:45.16 You want to hear a little story that I tell myself,
02:54:45.16 --> 02:54:47.68 whenever I get some kind of like little injury,
02:54:47.68 --> 02:54:50.60 even if it's like a more significant injury,
02:54:50.60 --> 02:54:52.88 maybe something that's going to make take me out of
02:54:52.88 --> 02:54:55.48 off my training schedule for a month, right?
02:54:55.48 --> 02:54:57.80 Her, my knee, her, my shoulder or something.
02:54:57.80 --> 02:55:00.80 I always tell myself that that was
02:55:00.80 --> 02:55:06.24 the greater powers way of getting me to not train
02:55:06.24 --> 02:55:08.40 because the next day I was really going to get her.
02:55:08.40 --> 02:55:08.80 Yeah.
02:55:08.80 --> 02:55:09.80 The next day I was really going to.
02:55:09.80 --> 02:55:10.60 That's all.
02:55:10.60 --> 02:55:11.60 So I'm just like, OK, cool.
02:55:11.60 --> 02:55:14.64 That's God's way of telling me, I'm not supposed to train
02:55:14.64 --> 02:55:16.80 right now because otherwise I was going to break my neck
02:55:16.80 --> 02:55:17.84 or something.
02:55:17.84 --> 02:55:18.92 So we're just going to.
02:55:18.92 --> 02:55:19.44 That's right.
02:55:19.44 --> 02:55:20.04 That's the story.
02:55:20.04 --> 02:55:21.64 I tell myself sometimes.
02:55:21.64 --> 02:55:24.72 I think it's a, I mean, it's not a joke.
02:55:24.72 --> 02:55:26.32 I think it's a real.
02:55:26.32 --> 02:55:28.44 I believe in that kind of stuff, honestly.
02:55:28.44 --> 02:55:32.08 I believe that some things happen for a reason.
02:55:32.08 --> 02:55:35.000 It's up to you to actually react to it appropriately.
02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:36.48 But I don't know.
02:55:36.48 --> 02:55:38.000 I actually do believe in that.
02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:41.28 And I think that comes out in this chapter.
02:55:41.28 --> 02:55:43.000 So next time.
02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:43.36 All right.
02:55:43.36 --> 02:55:45.56 Next chapter, you went from the personal story.
02:55:45.56 --> 02:55:47.60 Now we're talking about the story of America.
02:55:47.60 --> 02:55:50.84 This is chapter 10.
02:55:50.84 --> 02:55:54.24 The individual stories we tell ourselves, not just about our hardships,
02:55:54.24 --> 02:55:57.68 but about who we are, combined to create our American story.
02:55:57.68 --> 02:56:01.60 Every one of us adds a small thread to the larger fabric of our culture.
02:56:01.60 --> 02:56:06.32 And as we change and evolve, so do our cultural norms.
02:56:06.32 --> 02:56:08.80 The American story itself evolves.
02:56:08.80 --> 02:56:10.60 This isn't a bad thing either.
02:56:10.60 --> 02:56:14.68 It is natural and constant throughout history.
02:56:14.68 --> 02:56:17.16 But something is changing for the worse.
02:56:17.16 --> 02:56:20.92 The American story itself is being threatened.
02:56:20.92 --> 02:56:24.88 Our cultural fabric has often changed and evolved,
02:56:24.88 --> 02:56:28.12 but it has never been irreparably torn.
02:56:28.12 --> 02:56:31.08 The close to we ever came was a civil war.
02:56:31.08 --> 02:56:33.84 I suggest you that the latest threat to our American story
02:56:33.84 --> 02:56:37.16 is outrage, culture, identity politics, and victimhood
02:56:37.16 --> 02:56:40.48 ideology that it elevates.
02:56:40.48 --> 02:56:42.72 The threat is born of small beginnings as big threats.
02:56:42.72 --> 02:56:45.76 So often, it starts with toxic personal narratives,
02:56:45.76 --> 02:56:50.92 wrapped in cheap cloth of victimhood, always looking to an external
02:56:50.92 --> 02:56:56.16 culprit to blame for real or perceived injustices.
02:56:56.16 --> 02:57:01.16 So this is the direction you fear that we are heading right now.
02:57:01.16 --> 02:57:04.44 I think we're there.
02:57:04.44 --> 02:57:06.000 So pessimistic.
02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.44 Well, it's just, well, I'll tell you one thing.
02:57:08.44 --> 02:57:09.44 I don't need to talk to you, right?
02:57:09.44 --> 02:57:14.48 Well, I was going to say, I was just like when I was with Ben Shapiro.
02:57:14.48 --> 02:57:17.04 And I just went up and talked to Candace Owens.
02:57:17.04 --> 02:57:23.28 And they live at Ground Zero for interacting with crazy people.
02:57:23.28 --> 02:57:26.88 I mean, and you're not quite as big.
02:57:26.88 --> 02:57:29.76 It becomes all you see and you get a little bit more pessimistic.
02:57:29.76 --> 02:57:30.76 Exactly.
02:57:30.76 --> 02:57:35.32 And I'm really lucky because I work with a bunch of different companies,
02:57:35.32 --> 02:57:38.40 all over the country, and work with every different type of company,
02:57:38.40 --> 02:57:40.40 and work with all levels inside of a company.
02:57:40.40 --> 02:57:44.72 So I'm not just out there only talking to the CEOs and the C-suite.
02:57:44.72 --> 02:57:48.12 I'm also out there talking to frontline troops, communicating with them,
02:57:48.12 --> 02:57:49.48 talking to what problems they have.
02:57:49.48 --> 02:57:51.76 So we really get to see everyone at National Front.
02:57:51.76 --> 02:57:58.36 We really get to see the pulse of not only of America over a large span,
02:57:58.36 --> 02:58:02.72 but at a bunch of different socioeconomic levels,
02:58:02.72 --> 02:58:04.76 and in a bunch of different industries.
02:58:04.76 --> 02:58:11.76 Whereas, I mean, Candace and Ben, like, they go to,
02:58:11.92 --> 02:58:13.92 they go to speak at colleges.
02:58:13.92 --> 02:58:15.16 That's kind of what they do.
02:58:15.16 --> 02:58:16.000 You know?
02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:20.20 And you're not going to run into the same type of people,
02:58:20.20 --> 02:58:23.08 but I'm going to run into that's working on a construction site
02:58:23.08 --> 02:58:26.32 or in a manufacturing plant in Iowa.
02:58:26.32 --> 02:58:28.16 No, you're sure not.
02:58:28.16 --> 02:58:30.96 I do the same thing.
02:58:30.96 --> 02:58:34.24 I've been pleasantly surprised to be perfectly honest with you.
02:58:34.24 --> 02:58:36.52 Even when I go to colleges and especially high schools,
02:58:36.52 --> 02:58:38.64 I think the questions are good.
02:58:38.64 --> 02:58:42.84 If there's disagreement, it's been good.
02:58:42.84 --> 02:58:44.08 Yeah, actually now that you mentioned,
02:58:44.08 --> 02:58:45.92 I go and talk at colleges sometimes too.
02:58:45.92 --> 02:58:50.08 And you mentioned, you know, you were talking about the kind of crowd
02:58:50.08 --> 02:58:54.72 that comes in to see, the kind of crowd that comes in to see Candace Owens
02:58:54.72 --> 02:58:56.40 or Ben Shapiro.
02:58:56.40 --> 02:58:57.72 Sure, there's people that want to see them
02:58:57.72 --> 02:58:59.24 that have like a concerned viewpoint,
02:58:59.24 --> 02:59:02.08 but they probably attract at least as many
02:59:02.08 --> 02:59:04.76 if not more lunatics.
02:59:04.76 --> 02:59:05.48 They do.
02:59:05.48 --> 02:59:08.68 And it's, I've seen it happen less over time,
02:59:08.68 --> 02:59:13.68 also because Ben and Candace and Charlie Kirkday
02:59:14.68 --> 02:59:16.000 that is kind of what they're looking for
02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.24 because they want the debate to happen on camera.
02:59:18.24 --> 02:59:20.72 I personally enjoy it too.
02:59:20.72 --> 02:59:25.12 Like I want people in the left to come and debate me.
02:59:25.12 --> 02:59:27.16 And I'm going to, that's what I want.
02:59:27.16 --> 02:59:29.20 It's one of the reasons I'm doing it.
02:59:29.20 --> 02:59:30.96 If it's just a bunch of people there agreeing with me,
02:59:30.96 --> 02:59:34.92 then I'm not making a lot of progress.
02:59:34.92 --> 02:59:36.96 It's really just a rally at that point.
02:59:36.96 --> 02:59:39.88 And there's value in that too, but we are going there
02:59:39.88 --> 02:59:41.72 for the confrontation.
02:59:41.72 --> 02:59:45.000 I just wanted to be respectful and fact-based.
02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:46.60 And it's not always that way.
02:59:46.60 --> 02:59:48.12 I've had some interesting experiences
02:59:48.12 --> 02:59:51.08 where it's just it just devolved into emotional ramblings.
02:59:51.08 --> 02:59:55.32 But I've felt so that's some really interesting public debates.
02:59:55.32 --> 02:59:57.80 And like that's kind of a usual for a politician to do.
02:59:57.80 --> 03:00:00.32 See, that's the Candace Owens and Ben Shapiro model.
03:00:00.32 --> 03:00:01.68 It's unusual for a politician to do
03:00:01.68 --> 03:00:04.04 because we can get in so much more trouble doing it.
03:00:04.04 --> 03:00:05.08 Because it's dangerous.
03:00:05.08 --> 03:00:07.20 It's, you don't know how that's going to go.
03:00:07.20 --> 03:00:09.72 People setting up ambushes on you have got your moment.
03:00:09.72 --> 03:00:10.72 Right.
03:00:10.72 --> 03:00:13.88 And so just be prepared for it and you'll be fine.
03:00:13.88 --> 03:00:15.56 Know what you're talking about.
03:00:15.56 --> 03:00:16.88 So I do it.
03:00:16.88 --> 03:00:21.000 But I enjoy it quite a bit.
03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.88 So the back to the original question,
03:00:23.88 --> 03:00:27.24 which is, are we there as a culture?
03:00:27.24 --> 03:00:30.52 Any answer is kind of like, it's worse than it used to be.
03:00:30.52 --> 03:00:31.76 How about that?
03:00:31.76 --> 03:00:34.32 Whether we're in a disaster area right now
03:00:34.32 --> 03:00:37.28 with respect to victimhood ideology and identity politics.
03:00:37.28 --> 03:00:39.28 That could be debated forever
03:00:39.28 --> 03:00:40.92 and it kind of depends on what your standard is.
03:00:40.92 --> 03:00:42.48 You know, like, whoa, what does it look like
03:00:42.48 --> 03:00:44.76 to be over the edge on that?
03:00:44.76 --> 03:00:45.72 Like, I'm not sure.
03:00:45.72 --> 03:00:47.32 I just know it's worse.
03:00:47.32 --> 03:00:48.92 I just know it's gotten a lot worse.
03:00:48.92 --> 03:00:53.24 And other reference Jonathan Height quite a bit
03:00:53.24 --> 03:00:56.32 in this book, one of my favorite authors.
03:00:56.32 --> 03:00:58.32 And his book, The Coddling of the American Mind,
03:00:58.32 --> 03:00:59.16 is a great read.
03:00:59.16 --> 03:01:01.72 If you're really looking to examine how this evolved
03:01:01.72 --> 03:01:04.24 on college campuses and they can really examine it
03:01:04.24 --> 03:01:07.96 down to the year, about 2013, which
03:01:07.96 --> 03:01:10.40 and then they examine all the reasons for this,
03:01:10.40 --> 03:01:11.48 the sort of outreach culture.
03:01:11.48 --> 03:01:13.72 And even then, though, they point out,
03:01:13.72 --> 03:01:17.48 it's mostly at the coastal elite institutions.
03:01:17.48 --> 03:01:19.76 It happens a lot less on other college campuses
03:01:19.76 --> 03:01:21.96 where less in the reality is most college kids
03:01:21.96 --> 03:01:25.72 just want to get drunk and get through their next class.
03:01:25.72 --> 03:01:31.72 And they're not super hyped up about politics.
03:01:31.72 --> 03:01:34.20 Social media, the fact, and those of us who live
03:01:34.20 --> 03:01:35.48 within the world of social media
03:01:35.48 --> 03:01:39.88 also makes us believe that it's a lot worse than it really is.
03:01:39.88 --> 03:01:41.64 And you have to remove yourself from that.
03:01:41.64 --> 03:01:44.60 And so you won't seem to be using examples
03:01:44.60 --> 03:01:48.56 in this book of people on social media.
03:01:48.56 --> 03:01:52.20 You'll seem to be using examples from leaders in our country.
03:01:52.20 --> 03:01:58.40 And big media companies like The New York Times,
03:01:58.40 --> 03:02:01.08 really pushing these narratives.
03:02:01.08 --> 03:02:04.88 So I'm not getting my evidence for this problem
03:02:04.88 --> 03:02:08.52 from random commentators, even if I could count thousands
03:02:08.52 --> 03:02:10.40 of them, because it's like what are thousands?
03:02:10.40 --> 03:02:11.68 A tiny, tiny little, little, little, little
03:02:11.68 --> 03:02:13.24 beauty fraction of the United States.
03:02:13.24 --> 03:02:16.44 What matters is the leaders and how that's changed over time.
03:02:16.44 --> 03:02:18.44 So that's why I come at this and I say,
03:02:18.44 --> 03:02:21.12 there is a real problem here and we're there
03:02:21.12 --> 03:02:23.36 because our leaders are talking like this.
03:02:23.36 --> 03:02:26.88 Like this is a bigger movement than just some idiots
03:02:26.88 --> 03:02:27.64 on Twitter.
03:02:27.64 --> 03:02:28.72 It's bigger than that.
03:02:28.72 --> 03:02:31.04 And so that's why I'm not going to be
03:02:31.04 --> 03:02:34.32 I think it's such a, because if I couldn't find those
03:02:34.32 --> 03:02:37.40 examples, then I would argue that,
03:02:37.40 --> 03:02:38.76 yeah, maybe I'm over blowing it.
03:02:38.76 --> 03:02:43.76 But the victimhood ideologies is it's here.
03:02:45.32 --> 03:02:48.60 And I could, from what you just read,
03:02:48.60 --> 03:02:50.08 the argument I'm making there,
03:02:50.08 --> 03:02:52.72 unless you were going to go on to something else.
03:02:52.72 --> 03:02:53.56 Go ahead.
03:02:53.56 --> 03:02:55.60 See the argument I'm making there is that there's a series
03:02:55.60 --> 03:02:57.76 of steps that have led to this moment
03:02:57.76 --> 03:03:00.32 where we're trying a different story about America.
03:03:00.32 --> 03:03:04.56 And I give an analysis of how it's victimhood ideology
03:03:04.56 --> 03:03:05.40 that's created this.
03:03:05.40 --> 03:03:07.60 There's a lot of elements, but victimhood ideologies
03:03:07.60 --> 03:03:08.84 are big one.
03:03:08.84 --> 03:03:10.32 It's because it first starts small.
03:03:10.32 --> 03:03:12.44 As I know there, it's a small beginnings
03:03:12.44 --> 03:03:14.64 where you're blaming somebody else,
03:03:14.64 --> 03:03:16.64 like maybe it's your platoon commander,
03:03:16.64 --> 03:03:18.60 who just didn't see the value in you,
03:03:18.60 --> 03:03:20.000 the way they should have.
03:03:21.12 --> 03:03:23.76 Which by the way, if you talk to modern military commanders
03:03:23.76 --> 03:03:26.76 as they problem with a younger generation,
03:03:26.76 --> 03:03:30.40 like they're seeing these differences in how it is to manage troops.
03:03:30.40 --> 03:03:32.24 It's just different.
03:03:32.24 --> 03:03:34.48 It's not the same.
03:03:34.48 --> 03:03:36.32 Like I came into the seal teams thinking,
03:03:36.32 --> 03:03:40.32 okay, I have to, I feel like I have to earn my way here.
03:03:40.32 --> 03:03:44.04 Newer, maybe team guys may be not team guys,
03:03:44.04 --> 03:03:46.000 but definitely in the military.
03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:49.80 Newer troops are thinking like they're owed more
03:03:49.80 --> 03:03:50.84 than, or they're,
03:03:50.84 --> 03:03:52.92 the organization itself has a duty to them,
03:03:52.92 --> 03:03:54.56 but not the other way around.
03:03:54.56 --> 03:03:56.96 Like a duty to give them more responsibility
03:03:56.96 --> 03:03:59.80 and leadership or whatever,
03:03:59.80 --> 03:04:02.52 but they haven't quite earned it yet.
03:04:02.52 --> 03:04:05.12 More status, but without earning it yet.
03:04:05.12 --> 03:04:07.40 This is something when I talk to leaders,
03:04:07.40 --> 03:04:10.24 I'm curious what your perception is on this
03:04:10.24 --> 03:04:12.48 because you talk to so many corporate leaders
03:04:12.48 --> 03:04:16.56 and how it is to manage the different generations.
03:04:16.56 --> 03:04:18.16 I don't know what that's like.
03:04:18.16 --> 03:04:19.64 Not only corporations,
03:04:19.64 --> 03:04:23.24 but also still talking to military troops
03:04:23.24 --> 03:04:26.52 and there's always people,
03:04:26.52 --> 03:04:30.12 well, this is a question that I get asked all the time.
03:04:30.12 --> 03:04:34.56 And it's, you know, what's wrong with my team?
03:04:35.96 --> 03:04:38.24 And you can probably guess how I answer that.
03:04:38.24 --> 03:04:39.84 This is leadership problem.
03:04:39.84 --> 03:04:42.64 And one of the things I fall back to all the time,
03:04:42.64 --> 03:04:47.64 so I don't know that I can think of a more difficult
03:04:47.64 --> 03:04:51.16 workforce to deal with than being,
03:04:51.16 --> 03:04:54.20 than dealing with draftees in Vietnam,
03:04:54.20 --> 03:04:55.44 in Vietnam more.
03:04:55.44 --> 03:04:57.68 People that did not believe in the cause
03:04:57.68 --> 03:05:01.04 did not want to do the job and in doing the job,
03:05:01.04 --> 03:05:04.36 their life and limb was at risk.
03:05:04.36 --> 03:05:06.96 You cannot think of a more difficult workforce
03:05:06.96 --> 03:05:08.04 to try and deal with.
03:05:08.04 --> 03:05:13.04 So I've read many, many, many, many books
03:05:13.04 --> 03:05:13.96 about Vietnam.
03:05:13.96 --> 03:05:18.96 I've interviewed many Vietnam veterans, leaders,
03:05:18.96 --> 03:05:21.36 and troops.
03:05:21.36 --> 03:05:23.16 And here's the deal.
03:05:23.16 --> 03:05:26.08 Good leaders, good leaders.
03:05:26.08 --> 03:05:29.56 And my first example is Colonel David Hackworth,
03:05:29.56 --> 03:05:32.24 who's like my personal mentor,
03:05:32.24 --> 03:05:36.40 he might never met him, but I read his book many times
03:05:36.40 --> 03:05:37.56 and all of his books many times.
03:05:37.56 --> 03:05:40.16 But when he talks about the draftees
03:05:40.16 --> 03:05:43.48 and he was in Korea and he was in Vietnam,
03:05:43.48 --> 03:05:45.16 he's a battalion commander, Vietnam.
03:05:45.16 --> 03:05:47.000 He was one of the most decorated guys ever.
03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:49.72 And when he would talk and he was a complete lifer,
03:05:49.72 --> 03:05:51.24 this guy worshiped the army.
03:05:51.24 --> 03:05:54.12 He was in the military since just 15 years old.
03:05:54.12 --> 03:05:56.72 He was all he ever knew.
03:05:56.72 --> 03:05:59.12 And when he would talk about his draftees
03:05:59.12 --> 03:06:01.24 and when he talks about him in his book about face,
03:06:01.24 --> 03:06:03.16 he loved his draftees.
03:06:03.16 --> 03:06:06.36 And he loved his draftees because guess what?
03:06:06.36 --> 03:06:09.72 They would call bullshit when they didn't think he was
03:06:09.72 --> 03:06:10.92 making a good call.
03:06:10.92 --> 03:06:13.60 They would give him pressure against what he was saying to do
03:06:13.60 --> 03:06:14.92 if it didn't make sense.
03:06:14.92 --> 03:06:16.24 They would test him.
03:06:16.24 --> 03:06:17.64 They would push back.
03:06:17.64 --> 03:06:21.20 And as a leader, he thought that's exactly what I want.
03:06:21.20 --> 03:06:23.36 That's exactly what I want is,
03:06:23.36 --> 03:06:25.64 I don't want people, I don't want to bunch of robots.
03:06:25.64 --> 03:06:30.64 I had one of his company commanders on the podcast
03:06:30.64 --> 03:06:31.84 who retired as a general.
03:06:32.88 --> 03:06:35.76 Mook, Mookayama, general Mookayama,
03:06:35.76 --> 03:06:37.40 fantastic guy.
03:06:37.40 --> 03:06:40.96 And I asked him and he was a company commander, Vietnam.
03:06:40.96 --> 03:06:42.48 And I said, what?
03:06:42.48 --> 03:06:44.56 Because this question I hear all the time,
03:06:44.56 --> 03:06:49.000 I said, you know, sir, what did you think of your draftees,
03:06:49.000 --> 03:06:50.40 in Vietnam?
03:06:50.40 --> 03:06:54.12 And he said, I really couldn't tell who was a draftee
03:06:54.12 --> 03:06:55.04 and who wasn't.
03:06:56.24 --> 03:07:00.20 And so then you read author books and what it boils down to is,
03:07:00.20 --> 03:07:02.44 and most of the books that are read are like interviews
03:07:02.44 --> 03:07:03.28 with people.
03:07:03.28 --> 03:07:07.20 And if you have leaders that are not good leaders,
03:07:07.20 --> 03:07:10.84 guess what they do, they complain about the draftees,
03:07:10.84 --> 03:07:13.52 about how they push back, they didn't follow orders.
03:07:13.52 --> 03:07:16.28 People like William Callie in charge of the MII masquer.
03:07:16.28 --> 03:07:17.12 What did he say?
03:07:17.12 --> 03:07:18.64 He hated draftees.
03:07:20.24 --> 03:07:21.72 Because he's a shitty leader.
03:07:22.80 --> 03:07:25.80 And so when you talked to me about a millennial,
03:07:25.80 --> 03:07:28.80 the characteristics of a millennial,
03:07:28.80 --> 03:07:31.60 hey, they think they deserve stuff,
03:07:31.60 --> 03:07:33.56 they want to know why they're doing what they're doing,
03:07:33.56 --> 03:07:35.04 they want to have ownership of stuff,
03:07:35.04 --> 03:07:37.04 they think they deserve to be in charge of stuff.
03:07:37.04 --> 03:07:39.68 And I'm like, bring me that new guy.
03:07:39.68 --> 03:07:41.72 I'll take that new guy any day of the week.
03:07:41.72 --> 03:07:42.96 And I'll take that new guy and be like,
03:07:42.96 --> 03:07:45.56 okay, you want to run stuff, you want to know why you're doing
03:07:45.56 --> 03:07:46.40 what you're doing?
03:07:46.40 --> 03:07:47.64 Absolutely, you deserve that.
03:07:47.64 --> 03:07:48.56 That's decentralized command,
03:07:48.56 --> 03:07:49.84 you need to know why you're doing what you're doing.
03:07:49.84 --> 03:07:50.84 Perfect.
03:07:50.84 --> 03:07:52.04 You want to take ownership of stuff?
03:07:52.04 --> 03:07:53.20 Absolutely.
03:07:53.20 --> 03:07:56.24 You think you should be in a higher elevated position.
03:07:56.24 --> 03:07:58.64 Good, let's get you there.
03:07:58.64 --> 03:08:03.64 So we can always complain about the junior generation.
03:08:04.96 --> 03:08:08.000 The freaking kids and the teams right now are way better
03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:10.000 than I was when I checked in as a new guy,
03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:11.32 are you kidding me?
03:08:11.32 --> 03:08:12.52 They're way better.
03:08:12.52 --> 03:08:14.68 They're tough bastards too.
03:08:14.68 --> 03:08:16.04 It's not like they're just more tech,
03:08:16.04 --> 03:08:17.28 you know, some people will say,
03:08:17.28 --> 03:08:19.48 well, you know, the new generation's more tech savvy.
03:08:19.48 --> 03:08:20.72 It's like, yeah, they are.
03:08:20.72 --> 03:08:22.04 And their tough is hell.
03:08:23.16 --> 03:08:28.000 So when we start talking about what the problem with is
03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:31.32 with our troops, what a good leader does is says,
03:08:31.32 --> 03:08:35.72 okay, there's these, I need to treat this guy with,
03:08:35.72 --> 03:08:37.36 I need to make some maneuvers here
03:08:37.36 --> 03:08:39.20 to get this person on board with the program
03:08:39.20 --> 03:08:41.88 because it's not like some young army guys,
03:08:41.88 --> 03:08:43.76 like I don't want to do a good job.
03:08:43.76 --> 03:08:45.84 It's not like some person at a tech company,
03:08:45.84 --> 03:08:47.92 some person that just graduated from college
03:08:47.92 --> 03:08:49.92 and went to a tech company's like, you know what,
03:08:49.92 --> 03:08:52.04 I don't want to do well here.
03:08:52.04 --> 03:08:53.68 Like no, they want to do well.
03:08:53.68 --> 03:08:56.92 Now they might have some high visions of themselves.
03:08:56.92 --> 03:08:59.52 Cool, who's job is to put those visions in the check?
03:08:59.52 --> 03:09:01.72 Who's job is to explain them, listen man,
03:09:01.72 --> 03:09:04.20 I'm glad you want to step up and run everything.
03:09:04.20 --> 03:09:05.64 That's awesome.
03:09:05.64 --> 03:09:07.24 Let me ask you this.
03:09:07.24 --> 03:09:08.68 Do you even understand how this,
03:09:08.68 --> 03:09:11.20 you know, how the economy of our businesses working right now?
03:09:11.20 --> 03:09:14.04 To explain this, here, look at this spreadsheet
03:09:14.04 --> 03:09:15.24 and explain what this means.
03:09:15.24 --> 03:09:18.20 I have no idea, okay, cool, let's get you educated on this.
03:09:18.20 --> 03:09:19.76 Let's get you to learn this because you know what?
03:09:19.76 --> 03:09:21.08 I do want you to elevate.
03:09:21.08 --> 03:09:22.56 I want you to take over this company.
03:09:22.56 --> 03:09:23.76 That's fine.
03:09:23.76 --> 03:09:25.20 But you've got to learn this stuff with you.
03:09:25.20 --> 03:09:28.68 So as a leader, we've got to look at people
03:09:28.68 --> 03:09:30.36 and this again, this happens all the time
03:09:30.36 --> 03:09:32.000 and it happens within one puttune.
03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:35.20 You know, I guarantee you had guys in your puttune
03:09:35.20 --> 03:09:36.68 that thought they knew everything
03:09:36.68 --> 03:09:38.76 and you had some guys that were like happy to be here
03:09:38.76 --> 03:09:39.68 and they're just humble.
03:09:39.68 --> 03:09:41.08 You get all these guys.
03:09:41.08 --> 03:09:43.56 You get all these guys and is there some
03:09:43.56 --> 03:09:45.84 little difference in the generations?
03:09:45.84 --> 03:09:47.72 Sure, there's always difference in the generations.
03:09:47.72 --> 03:09:50.84 No freaking generation was just always mine, right?
03:09:50.84 --> 03:09:53.000 We always hear that, you know, the guys
03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:55.08 when I got to the teams, it was like the guys
03:09:55.08 --> 03:09:57.88 from the 70s were like, oh, the guys from the 80s are weak.
03:09:57.88 --> 03:09:59.36 And then the guys from the 80s said the guys
03:09:59.36 --> 03:10:00.28 from the 90s were weak.
03:10:00.28 --> 03:10:02.20 Like let's just keep going.
03:10:02.20 --> 03:10:04.24 How do we reflect things as a leader?
03:10:04.24 --> 03:10:05.48 Make adjustments.
03:10:05.48 --> 03:10:07.48 When if my team is not performing well,
03:10:07.48 --> 03:10:09.32 I'm a hundred percent responsible for it.
03:10:09.32 --> 03:10:10.76 If my team has a bad attitude,
03:10:10.76 --> 03:10:13.04 I'm a hundred percent responsible for it.
03:10:13.04 --> 03:10:14.32 And I'm going to get it fixed.
03:10:14.32 --> 03:10:14.96 That's what I'm going to do.
03:10:14.96 --> 03:10:17.08 I'm responsible for doing that.
03:10:17.08 --> 03:10:22.16 Yeah, that's a very nuanced look at this.
03:10:22.16 --> 03:10:23.92 I'm always asking this question because I'm
03:10:23.92 --> 03:10:25.44 a animal millennial, you know?
03:10:25.44 --> 03:10:31.000 It's hard to generalize a generation.
03:10:31.000 --> 03:10:34.04 You just can't, but you have to.
03:10:34.04 --> 03:10:35.96 There are stereotypes exist for a reason.
03:10:35.96 --> 03:10:38.96 So it's good for analysis to try and figure that out.
03:10:38.96 --> 03:10:41.32 And I don't know.
03:10:41.32 --> 03:10:42.64 I don't know where I fall on it.
03:10:42.64 --> 03:10:46.24 Because I see the, I do see some bad aspects.
03:10:46.24 --> 03:10:50.68 And you know, wanting more responsibility was maybe the wrong thing
03:10:50.68 --> 03:10:53.76 to hit on as a negative attribute.
03:10:53.76 --> 03:10:56.88 That's obviously a good thing.
03:10:56.88 --> 03:11:01.64 But sometimes it's accompanied by a,
03:11:01.64 --> 03:11:06.76 a not so humble belief that somebody is victimizing them
03:11:06.76 --> 03:11:10.72 and preventing them from moving up because of some kind of oppression.
03:11:10.72 --> 03:11:11.76 And that's.
03:11:11.76 --> 03:11:14.76 And if I get someone like that on my team,
03:11:14.76 --> 03:11:16.76 who's responsible for fixing that attitude?
03:11:16.76 --> 03:11:18.64 I can promise you right now.
03:11:18.64 --> 03:11:20.24 We'll play the question game all day long.
03:11:20.24 --> 03:11:22.36 And I do this with every level leadership.
03:11:22.36 --> 03:11:24.44 I have people coming, you know, my team's all jacked up.
03:11:24.44 --> 03:11:25.36 OK, cool.
03:11:25.36 --> 03:11:26.76 Who's in charge of your team?
03:11:26.76 --> 03:11:28.84 Well, yeah, that's right.
03:11:28.84 --> 03:11:29.20 You are.
03:11:29.20 --> 03:11:31.04 Or someone will say, my front line troops aren't doing what I'm doing.
03:11:31.04 --> 03:11:33.12 Oh, who's in charge of your front front line troops?
03:11:33.12 --> 03:11:33.72 It's Bill.
03:11:33.72 --> 03:11:34.72 OK, who's in charge of Bill?
03:11:34.72 --> 03:11:36.32 Mike, who's in charge of Mike?
03:11:36.32 --> 03:11:36.96 Me.
03:11:36.96 --> 03:11:38.28 That's right.
03:11:38.28 --> 03:11:40.32 You're responsible for what's going on down there.
03:11:40.32 --> 03:11:43.20 And if there's attitudes that you don't like,
03:11:43.20 --> 03:11:45.60 man, you're responsible for it.
03:11:45.60 --> 03:11:47.56 You are absolutely responsible for it.
03:11:47.56 --> 03:11:49.96 And if you're a good leader, you can get those attitudes
03:11:49.96 --> 03:11:51.92 to shift in the right direction.
03:11:51.92 --> 03:11:55.16 And generally, by doing exactly what we're talking about.
03:11:55.16 --> 03:11:57.56 When, and you and I were having a conversation earlier,
03:11:57.56 --> 03:12:00.32 it's like, if they understand why these decisions
03:12:00.32 --> 03:12:04.04 are being made or why they actually need to learn
03:12:04.04 --> 03:12:06.88 some of these front line jobs before they can move up the chain
03:12:06.88 --> 03:12:09.20 of rent, if they understand that they have a path
03:12:09.20 --> 03:12:12.92 for mobility to increase their pay and increase their
03:12:12.92 --> 03:12:14.88 responsibility inside of an organization,
03:12:14.88 --> 03:12:17.12 they'll go, OK, well, thank you for telling me that.
03:12:17.12 --> 03:12:19.000 And now I'm going to go get after it.
03:12:19.000 --> 03:12:22.40 As opposed to Millennial suck.
03:12:22.40 --> 03:12:25.84 And I can't deal with Millennial.
03:12:25.84 --> 03:12:27.24 It's like, OK, cool.
03:12:27.24 --> 03:12:28.24 Yeah.
03:12:28.24 --> 03:12:31.84 I mean, I guess that's why I wrote the book, right?
03:12:31.84 --> 03:12:34.20 Because because I do see these things as problems.
03:12:34.20 --> 03:12:37.28 And I don't see them in my team.
03:12:37.28 --> 03:12:38.44 My team's great.
03:12:38.44 --> 03:12:40.84 And they're Millennials or younger.
03:12:40.84 --> 03:12:45.48 So obviously, something is working there.
03:12:45.48 --> 03:12:48.36 Maybe that's because I hired the right people with the right
03:12:48.36 --> 03:12:49.48 temperament.
03:12:49.48 --> 03:12:50.000 I don't know.
03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:51.88 And who's in charge of doing that?
03:12:51.88 --> 03:12:52.48 Well, Nate.
03:12:52.48 --> 03:12:53.48 Exactly.
03:12:53.48 --> 03:12:54.16 Exactly.
03:12:54.16 --> 03:12:56.88 So when you meet someone that says, oh, I got these horrible people
03:12:56.88 --> 03:12:58.52 on my team.
03:12:58.52 --> 03:12:59.36 Have you tried to fix them?
03:12:59.36 --> 03:13:00.16 Yeah, but I can't fix them.
03:13:00.16 --> 03:13:01.28 Well, hey, who's fault is that?
03:13:01.28 --> 03:13:04.000 Who actually hired these people in the first place?
03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:07.44 If you sit down with someone and you interview them or you hire them
03:13:07.44 --> 03:13:10.24 and then they're horrible and they have a horrible attitude and they don't want
03:13:10.24 --> 03:13:11.60 to be a part of the team, great.
03:13:11.60 --> 03:13:12.80 You're not going to be a part of my team.
03:13:12.80 --> 03:13:13.80 Yeah.
03:13:13.80 --> 03:13:17.24 You're not going to be a part of my team if that's what you bring to the table.
03:13:17.24 --> 03:13:21.04 And so this book, I think, is like what I'm trying to do is look at it
03:13:21.04 --> 03:13:22.64 in a broader cultural problem.
03:13:22.64 --> 03:13:23.52 Because it is.
03:13:23.52 --> 03:13:24.52 It is.
03:13:24.52 --> 03:13:28.04 And then try to give lessons to fix it.
03:13:28.04 --> 03:13:33.04 Because for all the reasons you just stated, it's like it's, we have to take
03:13:33.04 --> 03:13:35.40 ownership of our culture as well.
03:13:35.40 --> 03:13:38.68 It's not just ownership of our team that we can, you know, you should,
03:13:38.68 --> 03:13:42.48 of course, and that you can control a lot when you're leading a team.
03:13:42.48 --> 03:13:46.32 But we've got to come together as a culture and be better.
03:13:46.32 --> 03:13:51.24 Because as a part you read, as an individual, you're an individual
03:13:51.24 --> 03:13:53.64 threat in the larger fabric of society.
03:13:53.64 --> 03:13:58.52 And our culture is being transformed and not in a good way.
03:13:58.52 --> 03:14:02.04 And I hope the problem isn't as bad as I kind of make it out to be.
03:14:02.04 --> 03:14:06.92 But, you know, worst case scenario, I'm wrong.
03:14:06.92 --> 03:14:09.000 And things are going on in a great direction.
03:14:09.000 --> 03:14:12.60 Well, even I wouldn't say worst case scenario you're wrong.
03:14:12.60 --> 03:14:15.76 I mean, clearly there are indicators of what you're talking about.
03:14:15.76 --> 03:14:18.64 And as you said, you're not talking about people on Twitter.
03:14:18.64 --> 03:14:23.60 You're talking about mainstream media organizations that
03:14:23.60 --> 03:14:25.84 proceed in this direction.
03:14:25.84 --> 03:14:29.60 And the analysis, because I went on off on a tangent talking about
03:14:29.60 --> 03:14:32.84 millennials and management issues with them.
03:14:32.84 --> 03:14:37.60 So the analysis I go into is it goes something like this.
03:14:37.60 --> 03:14:39.20 You believe in a victimhood ideology.
03:14:39.20 --> 03:14:41.60 Believe that somebody else is to blame, maybe it's your team,
03:14:41.60 --> 03:14:44.32 maybe it's your boss, maybe it's your parent, maybe it's your teacher.
03:14:44.32 --> 03:14:46.20 Whatever it is, somebody else is fault.
03:14:46.20 --> 03:14:46.60 Okay.
03:14:46.60 --> 03:14:50.20 You're in that, you're living that story about yourself individually.
03:14:50.20 --> 03:14:51.92 That is expanded.
03:14:51.92 --> 03:14:53.40 It's expanded to groups.
03:14:53.40 --> 03:14:56.40 It's expanded to this sort of group on group identity politics.
03:14:56.40 --> 03:15:00.84 And that my fate is tied to an immutable characteristic that is tied to a group.
03:15:00.84 --> 03:15:04.40 Maybe it's race, maybe it's gender, maybe it's socioeconomic in nature.
03:15:04.40 --> 03:15:09.40 And by consequence, there is another group of pressing my group.
03:15:09.40 --> 03:15:10.40 Okay.
03:15:10.40 --> 03:15:11.40 So it's group on group politics.
03:15:11.40 --> 03:15:13.40 This is identity politics to the courts.
03:15:13.40 --> 03:15:16.40 It's the promise of more power from one group to another.
03:15:16.40 --> 03:15:17.40 Okay.
03:15:17.40 --> 03:15:22.40 You're telling somebody there, a victim, and you're telling them that you're the champion of them against the oppressors.
03:15:22.40 --> 03:15:24.40 So that's the next thing.
03:15:24.40 --> 03:15:26.40 Then it evolves even more than that.
03:15:26.40 --> 03:15:29.40 It evolves into these kind of institutional conflicts.
03:15:29.40 --> 03:15:32.40 And so it's not just a group that's oppressing you.
03:15:32.40 --> 03:15:35.40 That group is tied to a broader institution.
03:15:35.40 --> 03:15:37.40 Maybe that institution is the church.
03:15:37.40 --> 03:15:41.40 Maybe that institution is some kind of cultural institution.
03:15:41.40 --> 03:15:44.40 Maybe it's a merit, maybe it's a meritocracy.
03:15:44.40 --> 03:15:46.40 That's me that's an institution.
03:15:46.40 --> 03:15:51.40 This notion that we compete based off of merit and that your reward is tied.
03:15:51.40 --> 03:15:54.40 To how well you perform or your talent.
03:15:54.40 --> 03:15:59.40 The meritocracy is an important institutional construct in our culture.
03:15:59.40 --> 03:16:00.40 Okay.
03:16:00.40 --> 03:16:01.40 There's other institutions too.
03:16:01.40 --> 03:16:02.40 Like the Supreme Court.
03:16:02.40 --> 03:16:03.40 Okay.
03:16:03.40 --> 03:16:05.40 When you're talking about packing the Supreme Court,
03:16:05.40 --> 03:16:08.40 you're talking about tearing down an institution.
03:16:08.40 --> 03:16:09.40 So there's government institutions.
03:16:09.40 --> 03:16:11.40 There's cultural institutions.
03:16:11.40 --> 03:16:12.40 There's social institutions.
03:16:12.40 --> 03:16:16.40 The word institution is malleable in that sense.
03:16:16.40 --> 03:16:20.40 And it should describe a kind of a cultural friend.
03:16:20.40 --> 03:16:23.40 Kind of a cultural framework that we operate in, I think.
03:16:23.40 --> 03:16:25.40 Those come under attack.
03:16:25.40 --> 03:16:28.40 You know, because it's the institution's fault.
03:16:28.40 --> 03:16:35.40 I talk about Thomas Sol, he's an economist and Hoover Institute and Stanford.
03:16:35.40 --> 03:16:39.40 Amazing, amazing thinker and author.
03:16:39.40 --> 03:16:47.40 He talks about how the French Revolution was laid by Russo.
03:16:47.40 --> 03:16:54.40 It was based on this idea that the natural state of things involved no suffering.
03:16:54.40 --> 03:16:58.40 But that it is institutions that cause suffering.
03:16:58.40 --> 03:17:00.40 That's a really interesting concept.
03:17:00.40 --> 03:17:03.40 It's like this belief that life is actually,
03:17:03.40 --> 03:17:10.40 it is not natural in life to be oppressed or to go through suffering.
03:17:10.40 --> 03:17:11.40 It is not natural.
03:17:11.40 --> 03:17:12.40 It is natural.
03:17:12.40 --> 03:17:14.40 It is the unnatural institutions.
03:17:14.40 --> 03:17:17.40 Man made institutions that created your suffering.
03:17:17.40 --> 03:17:20.40 Therefore, we must revolutionize those institutions.
03:17:20.40 --> 03:17:22.40 Terror them down and build our utopia.
03:17:22.40 --> 03:17:24.40 This was how the French Revolution happened.
03:17:24.40 --> 03:17:29.40 This is how 17,000 people were dead in the next few years from the terror that ensued.
03:17:29.40 --> 03:17:34.40 It is the thinking that led to Marxism and the horrors of the 20th century.
03:17:34.40 --> 03:17:40.40 This isn't all that controversial statement to make.
03:17:40.40 --> 03:17:42.40 It's just kind of how it happened.
03:17:42.40 --> 03:17:48.40 That is how the progressive left thinks as well.
03:17:48.40 --> 03:17:50.40 It comes from somewhere.
03:17:50.40 --> 03:17:54.40 Progressiveism has a history, just like conservatism has a history.
03:17:54.40 --> 03:17:58.40 It is a history based on this kind of your feelings are correct.
03:17:58.40 --> 03:18:01.40 If you feel something it must be right.
03:18:01.40 --> 03:18:03.40 And you should.
03:18:03.40 --> 03:18:07.40 And the injustices against you are always man-made.
03:18:07.40 --> 03:18:09.40 And they're always coming from an oppressor.
03:18:09.40 --> 03:18:11.40 They're never a natural part of life.
03:18:11.40 --> 03:18:15.40 Therefore, government is there to fix those institutions.
03:18:15.40 --> 03:18:18.40 That's why you must proceed with the revolution.
03:18:18.40 --> 03:18:21.40 This is the thinking that occurs.
03:18:21.40 --> 03:18:25.40 So that ends up, once you've turned down the institutions,
03:18:25.40 --> 03:18:28.40 there's another ultimate oppressor and it's the American founding itself.
03:18:28.40 --> 03:18:31.40 That's the story of America that keeps getting told.
03:18:31.40 --> 03:18:33.40 And that worries me a great deal.
03:18:33.40 --> 03:18:34.40 We didn't use to fight about that.
03:18:34.40 --> 03:18:37.40 The left and the right did not fight about the story of America.
03:18:37.40 --> 03:18:38.40 The way we're fighting about it now.
03:18:38.40 --> 03:18:45.40 And it's become this question of whether America was even founded on anything good at all.
03:18:45.40 --> 03:18:49.40 That's the story being spun.
03:18:49.40 --> 03:18:52.40 And it stems from this individual victimhood identity politics.
03:18:52.40 --> 03:18:54.40 And again, I'm not making this up.
03:18:54.40 --> 03:18:59.40 I'm not because I'm looking at major leaders that say these kind of things.
03:18:59.40 --> 03:19:01.40 You know, I quote, Beto.
03:19:01.40 --> 03:19:03.40 I quote, Ilhan Omar.
03:19:03.40 --> 03:19:07.40 America was founded on genocide, not that America committed genocide.
03:19:07.40 --> 03:19:09.40 That would be an accurate statement.
03:19:09.40 --> 03:19:11.40 But America was founded on it.
03:19:11.40 --> 03:19:14.40 That implies a very different meaning.
03:19:14.40 --> 03:19:18.40 Saying that white supremacy is a problem is a true statement.
03:19:18.40 --> 03:19:20.40 Saying we were founded on it.
03:19:20.40 --> 03:19:22.40 That's a different implication.
03:19:22.40 --> 03:19:26.40 You're in dating the American founding itself.
03:19:26.40 --> 03:19:27.40 So what does that lead to?
03:19:27.40 --> 03:19:30.40 Well, it leads to popularity with burning the American flag.
03:19:30.40 --> 03:19:33.40 Please, the popularity with kneeling for the national anthem.
03:19:33.40 --> 03:19:39.40 It leads to popularity with with with with attacking the pledge of allegiance as an institution and an of itself.
03:19:39.40 --> 03:19:48.40 It leads to it leads to the New York Times public, you know, the New York Times prioritizing a message that America is just okay.
03:19:48.40 --> 03:19:58.40 On the Fourth of July, like it leads, you know, I open up in this chapter talking about the New York Times going after the Apollo 1158th anniversary.
03:19:58.40 --> 03:20:03.40 Basically praising the USSR instead of America on this day.
03:20:03.40 --> 03:20:06.40 It's like, why is that? Why is that the reaction?
03:20:06.40 --> 03:20:12.40 Because there's there's need to tear down the institutions of America at its core.
03:20:12.40 --> 03:20:14.40 Why is that?
03:20:14.40 --> 03:20:21.40 Well, because you need to tear something down at its core if you want to implement the revolutionary utopia that you envision.
03:20:21.40 --> 03:20:24.40 So this is the most political chapter by far, right?
03:20:24.40 --> 03:20:29.40 This is where I really delve into the differences, like the real deep differences between conservatism and progressivism.
03:20:29.40 --> 03:20:35.40 Because I announced conservators a little bit on this too, as far as the victim put ideology goes.
03:20:35.40 --> 03:20:39.40 Like it's a different form of ideology, it's a different form of victim put, but it occurs.
03:20:39.40 --> 03:20:44.40 And it occurs up to the limits of tearing down institutions.
03:20:44.40 --> 03:20:48.40 Okay, conservators have a very inherent distrust of government institutions.
03:20:48.40 --> 03:20:52.40 Like sometimes to a to a conspiratorial degree.
03:20:52.40 --> 03:20:57.40 But we stop way short of actually bashing the founding of America.
03:20:57.40 --> 03:21:02.40 And then the solutions to this problem, which is what I really end the chapter with,
03:21:02.40 --> 03:21:09.40 I make a very strong argument for against, against progressivism as a solution to these problems.
03:21:09.40 --> 03:21:15.40 Mostly because progressivism at its heart is a promise to end your suffering.
03:21:15.40 --> 03:21:19.40 And that is an inherently dishonest promise to make.
03:21:19.40 --> 03:21:22.40 For the reasons I just say again, that's the basis of the French Revolution.
03:21:22.40 --> 03:21:25.40 We can end your suffering because it's man-made.
03:21:25.40 --> 03:21:26.40 It's not natural.
03:21:26.40 --> 03:21:30.40 The natural state of things is for you to live in a wonderful utopia,
03:21:30.40 --> 03:21:33.40 prancing around in the trees or whatever the heck they're imagining.
03:21:33.40 --> 03:21:35.40 It doesn't make any sense because it's not real.
03:21:35.40 --> 03:21:40.40 And so to tell somebody that you will and they're suffering to tell them that you can replace God with government.
03:21:40.40 --> 03:21:42.40 Because what is what is religion fundamentally?
03:21:42.40 --> 03:21:48.40 It's like that Jesus took on the crucifixion and the passion of the Christ is about
03:21:48.40 --> 03:21:51.40 him taking on the suffering.
03:21:51.40 --> 03:21:54.40 There's a spiritual element to this.
03:21:54.40 --> 03:22:02.40 And that can't be replaced by a government ideology.
03:22:02.40 --> 03:22:08.40 Fundamentally, it's basically a progressiveism attempts to promise people.
03:22:08.40 --> 03:22:12.40 And I'm also trying to define what I mean by the progressive movement,
03:22:12.40 --> 03:22:15.40 very carefully in the book because I don't want.
03:22:15.40 --> 03:22:20.40 There's a lot of people who identify as progressive because they just got back from a gay wedding.
03:22:20.40 --> 03:22:21.40 Or they like to smoke some pot.
03:22:21.40 --> 03:22:23.40 Or they like tattoos or whatever.
03:22:23.40 --> 03:22:24.40 Or they do yoga.
03:22:24.40 --> 03:22:31.40 Like, I define that very carefully as social progressivism in the modern sense.
03:22:31.40 --> 03:22:33.40 And that's just not what we're talking about here.
03:22:33.40 --> 03:22:38.40 I'm talking about the deeper underlying politics and history of the progressive movement
03:22:38.40 --> 03:22:40.40 and what it's fundamentally promising people.
03:22:40.40 --> 03:22:45.40 Talking about the role of government in your life.
03:22:45.40 --> 03:22:48.40 And because, again, I want to be readable to a lot of different people.
03:22:48.40 --> 03:22:51.40 But this is the most political chapter by far.
03:22:51.40 --> 03:22:59.40 You know, one thing that speaking of the tattooed yoga, whatever person,
03:22:59.40 --> 03:23:02.40 I was a really rebellious kid, right?
03:23:02.40 --> 03:23:09.40 And I think at some point there's going to have to be like a, like a,
03:23:09.40 --> 03:23:14.40 Republican with a Mohawk and face tattoos.
03:23:14.40 --> 03:23:18.40 That's going to come out and say, like, hey,
03:23:18.40 --> 03:23:21.40 I have face tattoos.
03:23:21.40 --> 03:23:27.40 I like whatever genre of underground subculture music.
03:23:27.40 --> 03:23:31.40 I don't want to conform to anything.
03:23:31.40 --> 03:23:38.40 And the best way to live that life is to actually support conservative values
03:23:38.40 --> 03:23:42.40 because conservative values support individual freedom.
03:23:42.40 --> 03:23:43.40 And that's what I believe in.
03:23:43.40 --> 03:23:46.40 And I think that's what's going to get some of these,
03:23:46.40 --> 03:23:50.40 because let's face it, an 18-year-old kid wants to be rebellious.
03:23:50.40 --> 03:23:51.40 Why?
03:23:51.40 --> 03:23:53.40 Because they trying to get out of the house, they're trying to show their dad,
03:23:53.40 --> 03:23:56.40 they don't need him anymore, they're trying to show their mom, they don't need him anymore.
03:23:56.40 --> 03:23:59.40 So I'm going to get a Mohawk and I'm going to tattoo him, my neck,
03:23:59.40 --> 03:24:01.40 and I'm going to move forward into the world.
03:24:01.40 --> 03:24:04.40 And other kids look around and go, okay, that's how we're rebelling.
03:24:04.40 --> 03:24:12.40 But at some point, you go, actually, it just blows my mind that people say,
03:24:12.40 --> 03:24:15.40 you know, you go up to anyone and say, you know,
03:24:15.40 --> 03:24:17.40 do you want the government to be in charge of anything?
03:24:17.40 --> 03:24:21.40 You go up to someone with a Mohawk and whatever.
03:24:21.40 --> 03:24:22.40 No way, man.
03:24:22.40 --> 03:24:23.40 No way, man.
03:24:23.40 --> 03:24:28.40 And then you go, cool, why would you vote for the government to be in more charge of more of our lives?
03:24:28.40 --> 03:24:31.40 I just don't think that connection gets made off of enough.
03:24:31.40 --> 03:24:36.40 No, it doesn't, and I deal with this often and since I talked to most not mostly,
03:24:36.40 --> 03:24:44.40 but I'm a politician who does a lot more youth engagement than most politicians do.
03:24:44.40 --> 03:24:47.40 And so I address this directly.
03:24:47.40 --> 03:24:50.40 Like, how do you, as a conservative young person,
03:24:50.40 --> 03:24:58.40 how do you make the case for conservatism to your fellow young people who kind of live by this kind of libertarian?
03:24:58.40 --> 03:25:01.40 I mean, what you described is sort of libertarian.
03:25:01.40 --> 03:25:04.40 An extra rebellious libertarian.
03:25:04.40 --> 03:25:07.40 These people who kind of live by this notion of, you know,
03:25:07.40 --> 03:25:17.40 social, progressivism and freedom, but fundamentally, they believe in a kind of Republican form of government that is out of your life and, you know,
03:25:17.40 --> 03:25:22.40 fiscally responsible, you know, they live by this mantra, well, I'm socially liberal but fiscally conservative.
03:25:22.40 --> 03:25:23.40 Right? That's what people say.
03:25:23.40 --> 03:25:25.40 And then they vote Democrat, 100%.
03:25:25.40 --> 03:25:30.40 Like, almost 100% of the time. So it's, it's a mantra that makes them feel good,
03:25:30.40 --> 03:25:32.40 but it doesn't mean anything to them.
03:25:32.40 --> 03:25:37.40 And, um, I mean, delving into this is like my life's work at this point.
03:25:37.40 --> 03:25:38.40 Yeah, I feel so unfair.
03:25:38.40 --> 03:25:41.40 And so I'm so glad I don't have to talk about this stuff all the time.
03:25:41.40 --> 03:25:42.40 I'll do it once a year with you.
03:25:42.40 --> 03:25:45.40 Yeah, it's, but it's a super interesting thing.
03:25:45.40 --> 03:25:51.40 And you're like, like, why, why is your entire vote, your entire vote on a political party,
03:25:51.40 --> 03:25:53.40 based on the abortion issue?
03:25:53.40 --> 03:25:55.40 I mean, it doesn't make sense.
03:25:55.40 --> 03:25:58.40 It's not a rational decision. I'm sorry. It's just not.
03:25:58.40 --> 03:26:03.40 Especially because that issue will not affect you, you know, because people will say this and they've got like three kids.
03:26:03.40 --> 03:26:06.40 And they're like, well, and they would never get an abortion themselves.
03:26:06.40 --> 03:26:08.40 It's like, well, this doesn't affect you at all.
03:26:08.40 --> 03:26:10.40 You know, you can make a pretty good argument.
03:26:10.40 --> 03:26:11.40 This should be decided at the state level.
03:26:11.40 --> 03:26:15.40 And yet you are voting 100% because of this issue at the federal level.
03:26:15.40 --> 03:26:17.40 This is not a rational decision.
03:26:17.40 --> 03:26:20.40 And, um, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or game marriage.
03:26:20.40 --> 03:26:23.40 It's like, it's, that's definitely not a rational decision.
03:26:23.40 --> 03:26:25.40 Considering it's not even argued about anymore.
03:26:25.40 --> 03:26:28.40 Like, that's the Supreme Court's done with that one.
03:26:28.40 --> 03:26:34.40 So, it doesn't, you know, it's, it's really surprising, um, to see how people think about these things.
03:26:34.40 --> 03:26:37.40 Um, and, and, and so I guess, bringing it back to the book.
03:26:37.40 --> 03:26:39.40 My point is I'm trying to distinguish there.
03:26:39.40 --> 03:26:45.40 I'm trying to distinguish this into a role of like what, or, to a conversation about what government is actually for.
03:26:45.40 --> 03:26:48.40 And how that manifests into victimhood ideology,
03:26:48.40 --> 03:26:52.40 how that manifests into the story about America because, again, I can,
03:26:52.40 --> 03:27:00.40 I can make it, it's a very short path from victimhood ideology and, and America as an oppressor to hatred of America itself.
03:27:00.40 --> 03:27:02.40 And I only, I only quote the big ones.
03:27:02.40 --> 03:27:06.40 I only quote, you know, Taylor Swift because she's a cultural icon.
03:27:06.40 --> 03:27:10.40 You know, and she's out there saying, if you're not a cisgender white male,
03:27:10.40 --> 03:27:12.40 your rights are being stripped away.
03:27:12.40 --> 03:27:14.40 That's a Taylor Swift quote.
03:27:14.40 --> 03:27:19.40 That's an amazing thing to say from one of the most successful prosperous people in the world.
03:27:19.40 --> 03:27:20.40 Why would she believe that?
03:27:20.40 --> 03:27:27.40 Like, what is happening that she believes this thing, that is so fundamentally not true,
03:27:27.40 --> 03:27:30.40 that is so easy to, to debunk.
03:27:30.40 --> 03:27:33.40 Why would she believe this? Why did AOC believe,
03:27:33.40 --> 03:27:35.40 because she, because that's the next one I quote,
03:27:35.40 --> 03:27:37.40 which is like, oh, what did she say?
03:27:37.40 --> 03:27:40.40 My generation is never known American prosperity.
03:27:40.40 --> 03:27:43.40 How does that make any sense?
03:27:43.40 --> 03:27:49.40 I mean, it, it, it only makes sense in this context where it's good to be really insane.
03:27:49.40 --> 03:27:50.40 Yeah.
03:27:50.40 --> 03:27:55.40 It, it only makes sense when you understand that the goal is to elevate victimhood.
03:27:55.40 --> 03:28:01.40 And then they use that, and then they use that to tear down the story of America itself.
03:28:01.40 --> 03:28:05.40 And it's, it's such a dangerous path that we're on,
03:28:05.40 --> 03:28:10.40 that we want to revolutionize the foundations of our prosperity,
03:28:10.40 --> 03:28:16.40 to such an extent. And again, the only way to justify the only way to make people believe that their eyes are lying to them,
03:28:16.40 --> 03:28:18.40 that all the good things around them are just lies.
03:28:18.40 --> 03:28:21.40 The only way to make them believe that is to constantly,
03:28:21.40 --> 03:28:24.40 it's to constantly hammer them with this crisis narrative,
03:28:24.40 --> 03:28:28.40 with this false narrative that people are trying to oppress them,
03:28:28.40 --> 03:28:31.40 or there's other people being oppressed, and you've never met them,
03:28:31.40 --> 03:28:33.40 but guess what? It's happening.
03:28:33.40 --> 03:28:36.40 And if you don't, and if you don't raise your fist against the injustice,
03:28:36.40 --> 03:28:37.40 then you're part of the problem.
03:28:37.40 --> 03:28:40.40 You win your white privilege.
03:28:40.40 --> 03:28:43.40 This is happening in such an extreme level.
03:28:43.40 --> 03:28:47.40 You know, and it's, again, the good news is,
03:28:47.40 --> 03:28:49.40 is like people listening like, well, I haven't seen it.
03:28:49.40 --> 03:28:52.40 And look good. That's good. But it is happening.
03:28:52.40 --> 03:28:54.40 Yeah, no, I mean, we've got to be aware.
03:28:54.40 --> 03:28:58.40 Like you said, there's evidence, big evidence from real players out there
03:28:58.40 --> 03:29:03.40 that that preach this and live this sort of life.
03:29:03.40 --> 03:29:07.40 It's kind of interesting, man, because we, on this podcast,
03:29:07.40 --> 03:29:09.40 very seldom talk about politics at all.
03:29:09.40 --> 03:29:14.40 And yet, people kind of know where I stand,
03:29:14.40 --> 03:29:17.40 and they kind of, you know, just, it's all good.
03:29:17.40 --> 03:29:23.40 Well, like you said, it is a real thing.
03:29:23.40 --> 03:29:25.40 That is going on. It is a problem.
03:29:25.40 --> 03:29:30.40 And that's one thing that I would say is very nice about your book,
03:29:30.40 --> 03:29:33.40 is that it is a, first of all, it explains it.
03:29:33.40 --> 03:29:38.40 And it gives some pretty good answers on how to move forward.
03:29:38.40 --> 03:29:40.40 And one of the things you do is you, you close out with,
03:29:40.40 --> 03:29:43.40 with an American ethos.
03:29:43.40 --> 03:29:44.40 Yeah.
03:29:44.40 --> 03:29:46.40 Set, you set forth an American ethos in the book.
03:29:46.40 --> 03:29:49.40 Or what I think you called a draft or, you say,
03:29:49.40 --> 03:29:50.40 perhaps it goes something like this.
03:29:50.40 --> 03:29:52.40 And you spell it out.
03:29:52.40 --> 03:29:54.40 Preciate forward.
03:29:54.40 --> 03:29:58.40 Nothing that really anybody would sensibly argue with.
03:29:58.40 --> 03:29:59.40 Right.
03:29:59.40 --> 03:30:02.40 You know, nothing that you could really sensibly argue with.
03:30:02.40 --> 03:30:07.40 And I'll let people get the book and read it.
03:30:07.40 --> 03:30:10.40 But, you know, the last line of it is, you know,
03:30:10.40 --> 03:30:11.40 I will live with fortitude.
03:30:11.40 --> 03:30:13.40 You know, name of the book is fortitude.
03:30:13.40 --> 03:30:17.40 That's sort of the last line of the American ethos that you put forth.
03:30:17.40 --> 03:30:20.40 And that's a simple statement, right?
03:30:20.40 --> 03:30:24.40 It's a simple statement, but it's something that you can actually carry with you
03:30:24.40 --> 03:30:25.40 in every part of your life.
03:30:25.40 --> 03:30:28.40 And the way you tie fortitude into all these other aspects of,
03:30:28.40 --> 03:30:31.40 how to deal with other people, how to react to things.
03:30:31.40 --> 03:30:33.40 That is what the book is about.
03:30:33.40 --> 03:30:36.40 And it really sets forth a,
03:30:36.40 --> 03:30:41.40 a great path for people to go down to get their themselves,
03:30:41.40 --> 03:30:51.40 their family, their country into a more stable and productive and better place.
03:30:51.40 --> 03:30:57.40 So, I've read, I'll just tell you a fraction of the book today.
03:30:57.40 --> 03:31:00.40 Whoever, what you should do is order this book right now.
03:31:00.40 --> 03:31:02.40 Now, here's something that you haven't ran into yet, Dan.
03:31:02.40 --> 03:31:04.40 You're publisher.
03:31:04.40 --> 03:31:08.40 Your publisher is, first of all, they're underestimating you.
03:31:08.40 --> 03:31:12.40 They're underestimating the people that want to hear this message.
03:31:12.40 --> 03:31:15.40 So, they're only going to print X amount of books.
03:31:15.40 --> 03:31:17.40 They're looking at pre-sales.
03:31:17.40 --> 03:31:20.40 They're like, okay, we're only going to print X amount of books.
03:31:20.40 --> 03:31:21.40 Because it's investment.
03:31:21.40 --> 03:31:22.40 It's a risk for them.
03:31:22.40 --> 03:31:25.40 And then what happens is, the book comes out.
03:31:25.40 --> 03:31:27.40 People start to read it.
03:31:27.40 --> 03:31:28.40 It catches on fire.
03:31:28.40 --> 03:31:32.40 And then all of a sudden, there are four weeks out from printing more books.
03:31:32.40 --> 03:31:36.40 So, what people need to do right now is pre-order the book.
03:31:36.40 --> 03:31:37.40 Pre-order the book.
03:31:37.40 --> 03:31:39.40 Which makes the publisher then print more.
03:31:39.40 --> 03:31:44.40 Also, I should note, all pre-orders are getting a signed book plate.
03:31:44.40 --> 03:31:46.40 Oh, all of them.
03:31:46.40 --> 03:31:47.40 Ouch.
03:31:47.40 --> 03:31:49.40 Yeah, my hand hurts.
03:31:49.40 --> 03:31:51.40 Yeah, that's not fun.
03:31:51.40 --> 03:31:54.40 So, what do the book write now?
03:31:54.40 --> 03:31:57.40 We'll have it on our website so you guys can click through and order it.
03:31:57.40 --> 03:31:59.40 Well, I need to clarify that.
03:31:59.40 --> 03:32:07.40 You have to go to dancrenchabbook.com slash pre-order to upload your receipt so that we know you pre-order it and can actually get you the book plate.
03:32:07.40 --> 03:32:08.40 You know what?
03:32:08.40 --> 03:32:10.40 If you do that, you get the book plate.
03:32:10.40 --> 03:32:12.40 I've been putting out that website pretty calm.
03:32:12.40 --> 03:32:13.40 Yeah, cool.
03:32:13.40 --> 03:32:15.40 I'm going to take this as a personal challenge to see if I can break you.
03:32:15.40 --> 03:32:20.40 Get so many freaking pre-orders that you have to sign book plates for leg.
03:32:20.40 --> 03:32:21.40 I love this.
03:32:21.40 --> 03:32:23.40 This, I mean, do something hard.
03:32:23.40 --> 03:32:25.40 You know, sign one million book plates.
03:32:25.40 --> 03:32:26.40 Do something hard.
03:32:26.40 --> 03:32:27.40 That is nasty.
03:32:27.40 --> 03:32:28.40 Really?
03:32:28.40 --> 03:32:30.40 You actually have a podcast now.
03:32:30.40 --> 03:32:33.40 Your own podcast, which is called Hold These Truths.
03:32:33.40 --> 03:32:34.40 Yeah.
03:32:34.40 --> 03:32:35.40 Tell us about that podcast a little bit.
03:32:35.40 --> 03:32:38.40 So, I'm always looking for ways to communicate.
03:32:38.40 --> 03:32:40.40 It's my job.
03:32:40.40 --> 03:32:45.40 I've got to communicate the truth and the policies that I believe are right.
03:32:45.40 --> 03:32:47.40 And the things we're voting on in Washington.
03:32:47.40 --> 03:32:50.40 So, I do that a ton on social media as everybody knows that.
03:32:50.40 --> 03:32:55.40 And there's, there's, you know, there's a different method of communicating for every platform.
03:32:55.40 --> 03:33:04.40 And one thing that you can't do on Instagram and Facebook and Twitter is have really lengthy conversations and deep dives into policy issues.
03:33:04.40 --> 03:33:06.40 So, I do that on the podcast.
03:33:06.40 --> 03:33:15.40 And, you know, it started because I'm like, you know, I get these five-minute conversations during hearings when I have a really interesting witness come and talk about something.
03:33:15.40 --> 03:33:20.40 And maybe I'll meet with that person later, too. And it's a really interesting conversation.
03:33:20.40 --> 03:33:23.40 And I ask some, you know, questions that I need answered.
03:33:23.40 --> 03:33:26.40 Why don't we record that?
03:33:26.40 --> 03:33:27.40 Why don't we dive into these things?
03:33:27.40 --> 03:33:31.40 And so, what you'll find from that podcast is a whole variety of issues.
03:33:31.40 --> 03:33:34.40 You know, one day it'll be about Iran or China.
03:33:34.40 --> 03:33:36.40 Another day it'll be about student loans.
03:33:36.40 --> 03:33:39.40 I've interviewed the previous head of the ACLU.
03:33:39.40 --> 03:33:40.40 We'll talk about free speech.
03:33:40.40 --> 03:33:43.40 We'll talk about, you know, discrimination law.
03:33:43.40 --> 03:33:45.40 Make sense in these conditions.
03:33:45.40 --> 03:33:48.40 Like, there's some really fascinating deep dives.
03:33:48.40 --> 03:33:50.40 We'll talk about 5G.
03:33:50.40 --> 03:33:52.40 We'll talk about Bitcoin.
03:33:52.40 --> 03:33:55.40 I mean, a whole variety of things.
03:33:55.40 --> 03:33:59.40 Medicare for all, the environment, the green-new deal, all of this stuff.
03:33:59.40 --> 03:34:02.40 And we're talking to actual experts on the subjects.
03:34:02.40 --> 03:34:06.40 I'll say that your job gives you access to people that actually know what they're talking about.
03:34:06.40 --> 03:34:08.40 Yeah. They'll come and talk to me.
03:34:08.40 --> 03:34:10.40 And are you bringing on people that you don't agree with?
03:34:10.40 --> 03:34:14.40 Well, I've gotten into debates with some for sure.
03:34:14.40 --> 03:34:16.40 Especially head of the ACLU.
03:34:16.40 --> 03:34:18.40 We probably could do more of that.
03:34:18.40 --> 03:34:19.40 It just started.
03:34:19.40 --> 03:34:24.40 So I'm trying to build up a library right now of just deep dives into certain policies.
03:34:24.40 --> 03:34:27.40 Or I'm kind of just asking the questions.
03:34:27.40 --> 03:34:31.40 Because, you know, the way we went at this podcast,
03:34:31.40 --> 03:34:34.40 too, is like, I don't have time to prepare for it.
03:34:34.40 --> 03:34:39.40 And I'm too busy to take the time to really prepare a podcast the way you are preparing your podcast.
03:34:39.40 --> 03:34:40.40 Each time.
03:34:40.40 --> 03:34:43.40 It's not feasible for me.
03:34:43.40 --> 03:34:48.40 What's more feasible is that I'm just a genuinely curious person talking to another person who knows a lot of things.
03:34:48.40 --> 03:34:50.40 That I can take an hour out and do.
03:34:50.40 --> 03:34:53.40 And I think it ends up being pretty good.
03:34:53.40 --> 03:34:53.40 Yeah.
03:34:53.40 --> 03:35:02.40 And so, you know, we haven't had a full-on debate on a podcast yet.
03:35:02.40 --> 03:35:06.40 And haven't figured out how I would even structure that if we were to.
03:35:06.40 --> 03:35:09.40 Because I debate on my public life so often.
03:35:09.40 --> 03:35:10.40 It's like, you know, I don't know.
03:35:10.40 --> 03:35:15.40 He's not only, I don't need to put it on the podcast either, but I've been to a lot of people like to watch it though.
03:35:15.40 --> 03:35:16.40 Yeah.
03:35:16.40 --> 03:35:19.40 I mean, I think it would be nice because you could be in a situation where they're not constrained by time.
03:35:19.40 --> 03:35:21.40 If you got somebody else that was sane.
03:35:21.40 --> 03:35:22.40 Yeah.
03:35:22.40 --> 03:35:30.40 That had a different viewpoint on this area of the thing where you could actually discuss and maybe make some mutual forward progress
03:35:30.40 --> 03:35:35.40 between, you know, coming to better ideas or more mutually agreed upon ideas that might be nice.
03:35:35.40 --> 03:35:42.40 You are on Instagram at Dan Crenshaw TX, which is for Texas echo.
03:35:42.40 --> 03:35:44.40 In case you didn't know that.
03:35:44.40 --> 03:35:49.40 Facebook, Dan Crenshaw, at Dan Crenshaw, and you also have your website, which is Crenshaw for Congress.
03:35:49.40 --> 03:35:51.40 Is that where the book is as well?
03:35:51.40 --> 03:35:52.40 Or no.
03:35:52.40 --> 03:35:53.40 No.
03:35:53.40 --> 03:35:53.40 No.
03:35:53.40 --> 03:35:54.40 That's the book.
03:35:54.40 --> 03:35:55.40 The book is Dan Crenshaw book.com.
03:35:55.40 --> 03:35:56.40 Got it.
03:35:56.40 --> 03:35:57.40 You're like your branding.
03:35:57.40 --> 03:35:58.40 It's just like mine.
03:35:58.40 --> 03:35:59.40 My name.
03:35:59.40 --> 03:36:00.40 Yeah.
03:36:00.40 --> 03:36:01.40 That's the book.
03:36:01.40 --> 03:36:02.40 Exactly.
03:36:02.40 --> 03:36:10.40 Did I miss anything as far as like all this stuff as far as getting in touch with you and all that?
03:36:10.40 --> 03:36:11.40 No.
03:36:11.40 --> 03:36:13.40 I mean, it's easy to find me on social media.
03:36:13.40 --> 03:36:14.40 You have to keep in mind.
03:36:14.40 --> 03:36:17.40 Here's some annoyances about how my social media works.
03:36:17.40 --> 03:36:18.40 On Instagram, I have one account.
03:36:18.40 --> 03:36:19.40 Okay.
03:36:19.40 --> 03:36:20.40 It's my personal account.
03:36:20.40 --> 03:36:21.40 It's not really official.
03:36:21.40 --> 03:36:23.40 It's not really campaign.
03:36:23.40 --> 03:36:28.40 But the way the rules work, you have to generally differentiate between a official and
03:36:28.40 --> 03:36:31.40 campaign, which is why there's two Facebook accounts, which is why there's two Twitter accounts.
03:36:31.40 --> 03:36:35.40 And you have to follow all of them to get all the information.
03:36:35.40 --> 03:36:38.40 Instagram, if you're an Instagram user, it's a little easier for you.
03:36:38.40 --> 03:36:41.40 I just, because I control that's my personal account.
03:36:41.40 --> 03:36:46.40 And that's why you just have to search for me a couple times and then follow both.
03:36:46.40 --> 03:36:48.40 That's the only thing I would add.
03:36:48.40 --> 03:36:49.40 Got it.
03:36:49.40 --> 03:36:55.40 Now, Dan, I know you're doing a lot for America, which is definitely appreciated.
03:36:55.40 --> 03:37:00.40 But I want you to know that we're doing our part over here as well in the private sector.
03:37:00.40 --> 03:37:04.40 We're working hard to make people better.
03:37:04.40 --> 03:37:05.40 Yes.
03:37:05.40 --> 03:37:07.40 To make the economy better.
03:37:07.40 --> 03:37:16.40 And to rebuild the foundation of America, on at least one foundation of America, and that is self-reliance and our ability to create and build the best products in the world.
03:37:16.40 --> 03:37:18.40 100% American made.
03:37:18.40 --> 03:37:20.40 But I say 100% American made.
03:37:20.40 --> 03:37:21.40 Yes.
03:37:21.40 --> 03:37:22.40 Yeah.
03:37:22.40 --> 03:37:23.40 100% American made.
03:37:23.40 --> 03:37:25.40 In three years, I think it's three years.
03:37:25.40 --> 03:37:28.40 We've gone from eight employees to 80.
03:37:28.40 --> 03:37:31.40 We are just getting warmed up.
03:37:31.40 --> 03:37:33.40 A little company up in Maine.
03:37:33.40 --> 03:37:34.40 Yes.
03:37:34.40 --> 03:37:37.40 My home state, my home region, I should say.
03:37:37.40 --> 03:37:38.40 I'm a New Englander.
03:37:38.40 --> 03:37:39.40 Yeah.
03:37:39.40 --> 03:37:41.40 Because I got time in Connecticut and Maine.
03:37:41.40 --> 03:37:43.40 But I can acclaim it a little bit.
03:37:43.40 --> 03:37:44.40 My home record is Maine.
03:37:44.40 --> 03:37:45.40 Yes, you can claim it.
03:37:45.40 --> 03:37:47.40 So up there, we got a little factory.
03:37:47.40 --> 03:37:48.40 That's true.
03:37:48.40 --> 03:37:50.40 We got a little something called a origin Maine.
03:37:50.40 --> 03:37:51.40 Tell us about a deco Charles.
03:37:51.40 --> 03:37:52.40 Okay.
03:37:52.40 --> 03:37:53.40 Oh, well.
03:37:53.40 --> 03:37:55.40 Oh, by the way, we are getting softer.
03:37:55.40 --> 03:37:56.40 By the way.
03:37:56.40 --> 03:37:58.40 I think it's a good idea.
03:37:58.40 --> 03:38:01.40 Generally speaking, as a group, we are all getting softer.
03:38:01.40 --> 03:38:03.40 That's why generation after generation.
03:38:03.40 --> 03:38:06.40 They say, oh, my generation was harder than this new generation.
03:38:06.40 --> 03:38:07.40 That's why they always say it.
03:38:07.40 --> 03:38:08.40 You're saying it factually.
03:38:08.40 --> 03:38:09.40 It's factually.
03:38:09.40 --> 03:38:12.40 And this is why generally speaking, as true individuals,
03:38:12.40 --> 03:38:14.40 there's variations in individuals for sure.
03:38:14.40 --> 03:38:16.40 And even little micro groups for sure,
03:38:16.40 --> 03:38:17.40 variation.
03:38:17.40 --> 03:38:23.40 But there's why technology, the whole reason for technology is to solve our problems.
03:38:23.40 --> 03:38:24.40 Just to make things easier.
03:38:24.40 --> 03:38:25.40 Make everything easier, exactly right.
03:38:25.40 --> 03:38:30.40 And I'd say I like to look not like to, but I look at it as to solve our problems,
03:38:30.40 --> 03:38:32.40 which is making things easier for sure.
03:38:32.40 --> 03:38:35.40 So even like the caveman, right, when they invented the wheel,
03:38:35.40 --> 03:38:38.40 all these softies, they got the wheel now.
03:38:38.40 --> 03:38:40.40 Now, assume saying, because before that generation,
03:38:40.40 --> 03:38:42.40 we had to carry stuff.
03:38:42.40 --> 03:38:44.40 I mean, they're objectively harder.
03:38:44.40 --> 03:38:46.40 I think objectively speaking.
03:38:46.40 --> 03:38:47.40 I think so.
03:38:47.40 --> 03:38:49.40 It's not a bad thing that we've made things easier.
03:38:49.40 --> 03:38:51.40 But right, you have to art.
03:38:51.40 --> 03:38:53.40 It was just kind of the whole point of the chapter.
03:38:53.40 --> 03:38:54.40 Do something hard.
03:38:54.40 --> 03:38:56.40 You have to make up for that.
03:38:56.40 --> 03:38:57.40 Yeah, you have to make up for that.
03:38:57.40 --> 03:39:00.40 Art officially, yeah, hardening your own life.
03:39:00.40 --> 03:39:01.40 Oh, yeah.
03:39:01.40 --> 03:39:03.40 And that's why this is like your book is good.
03:39:03.40 --> 03:39:05.40 That's why what you say is good is because, right, we can't,
03:39:05.40 --> 03:39:09.40 this is a wave, a wave of just easiness coming on us.
03:39:09.40 --> 03:39:11.40 There's no stopping it.
03:39:11.40 --> 03:39:14.40 But individually, we can kind of like fight against,
03:39:14.40 --> 03:39:16.40 not necessarily the wave, but the results of the wave.
03:39:16.40 --> 03:39:18.40 Yeah, I'm saying.
03:39:18.40 --> 03:39:19.40 You can do something hard.
03:39:19.40 --> 03:39:20.40 Yeah.
03:39:20.40 --> 03:39:23.40 So what you get, though, what you will get inevitably is everyone with all
03:39:23.40 --> 03:39:24.40 their problem solved.
03:39:24.40 --> 03:39:26.40 And we're always looking for these little issues.
03:39:26.40 --> 03:39:27.40 Yeah.
03:39:27.40 --> 03:39:29.40 Because that's how, right, that's nature.
03:39:29.40 --> 03:39:33.40 So now it's like, hey, that's some injustice right there.
03:39:33.40 --> 03:39:39.40 Yeah, it's a lot, it's a lot harder to complain about the injustice of your wife,
03:39:39.40 --> 03:39:43.40 and your neighborhood, not being as strong as it's if you don't got food on your
03:39:43.40 --> 03:39:44.40 plate.
03:39:44.40 --> 03:39:45.40 Right.
03:39:45.40 --> 03:39:49.40 And it's, you don't have to think about like your kids know, right?
03:39:49.40 --> 03:39:51.40 Where it's like, oh, yeah, they got to wear helmets now.
03:39:51.40 --> 03:39:54.40 So you can say, hey, you guys got to wear seat belts now.
03:39:54.40 --> 03:39:57.40 So I get into like a 1965 something.
03:39:57.40 --> 03:39:58.40 Yeah.
03:39:58.40 --> 03:39:59.40 Right.
03:39:59.40 --> 03:39:59.40 You're going to die in that thing.
03:39:59.40 --> 03:40:02.40 It seems like it's the same, but that was just how bad that.
03:40:02.40 --> 03:40:03.40 Yeah.
03:40:03.40 --> 03:40:07.40 Now getting your 2020, whatever Tesla and probably you can fall asleep behind the wheel.
03:40:07.40 --> 03:40:08.40 You're safe.
03:40:08.40 --> 03:40:09.40 Yeah.
03:40:09.40 --> 03:40:10.40 They've got you.
03:40:10.40 --> 03:40:11.40 No problem exactly.
03:40:11.40 --> 03:40:12.40 Right.
03:40:12.40 --> 03:40:13.40 All your problems solved.
03:40:13.40 --> 03:40:17.40 So that's how, you know, it's like, you know, all these groups of people,
03:40:17.40 --> 03:40:21.40 like, very small groups of people, but they're super loud because they can be now.
03:40:21.40 --> 03:40:26.40 That's just how like back in the day you could not out hunting down elk for the bow and arrow.
03:40:26.40 --> 03:40:27.40 Yeah.
03:40:27.40 --> 03:40:31.40 And not to mention the technology allows all this, you know, so yeah, and they're louder
03:40:31.40 --> 03:40:37.40 whatever, but you make a good point where it's like, yeah, if you go out and look for all these
03:40:37.40 --> 03:40:39.40 issues, it's like, it's hard to find them.
03:40:39.40 --> 03:40:43.40 But you're how you say like Ben Shapiro and Dan, they're in ground zero.
03:40:43.40 --> 03:40:46.40 Oh, the ground man can't is that.
03:40:46.40 --> 03:40:47.40 That is better ground.
03:40:47.40 --> 03:40:48.40 Yeah.
03:40:48.40 --> 03:40:49.40 So it's going to seem pretty bad.
03:40:49.40 --> 03:40:51.40 On the last, yes.
03:40:51.40 --> 03:40:56.40 So yes, uh, keep up good fight against the weight of wealth.
03:40:56.40 --> 03:40:57.40 Doing hard things.
03:40:57.40 --> 03:40:58.40 What hard things you got for us?
03:40:58.40 --> 03:40:59.40 Echo Charles, what can we do?
03:40:59.40 --> 03:41:02.40 Gigiatsu, hard daily hard hardships.
03:41:02.40 --> 03:41:04.40 Oh, day daily hardships.
03:41:04.40 --> 03:41:10.40 You know, working out fitness, Gigiatsu and I wasn't going to say fashion, but that's more
03:41:10.40 --> 03:41:13.40 you're a shoe.
03:41:13.40 --> 03:41:14.40 That's hard for you.
03:41:14.40 --> 03:41:15.40 You see, okay.
03:41:15.40 --> 03:41:17.40 Anyway, so when we do Gigiatsu, what are we doing?
03:41:17.40 --> 03:41:20.40 Gigi, we don't Gigi, we don't know Gigi.
03:41:20.40 --> 03:41:25.40 No Gigi, if you get a Gigi, get an origin Gigi, for all the reasons you mentioned.
03:41:25.40 --> 03:41:26.40 Yeah.
03:41:26.40 --> 03:41:28.40 We'll get you up to the factory up in Maine, Dan.
03:41:28.40 --> 03:41:29.40 Yeah.
03:41:29.40 --> 03:41:30.40 You got to go check it out.
03:41:30.40 --> 03:41:31.40 It's, um, it's awesome.
03:41:31.40 --> 03:41:32.40 It's awesome.
03:41:32.40 --> 03:41:38.40 We literally brought the last, about the last loom in Lewiston, Maine from a 500,000 square
03:41:38.40 --> 03:41:42.40 foot of abandoned factory that hadn't been used in 20 years and all the other hundreds and
03:41:42.40 --> 03:41:44.40 hundreds of looms from that factory, sent overseas.
03:41:44.40 --> 03:41:46.40 We're bringing it back.
03:41:46.40 --> 03:41:47.40 We had one loom.
03:41:47.40 --> 03:41:49.40 Now I think we got four looms.
03:41:49.40 --> 03:41:51.40 We're, we're, we're bringing it back.
03:41:51.40 --> 03:41:56.40 And, uh, and, you know, the folks up there, these are folks that their industry was
03:41:56.40 --> 03:41:57.40 taken away from them.
03:41:57.40 --> 03:41:59.40 Their industry was sold overseas.
03:41:59.40 --> 03:42:01.40 And now they're back.
03:42:01.40 --> 03:42:04.40 Craftsman, crafts, women.
03:42:04.40 --> 03:42:10.40 Sowing, making boots, making jeans, all in America from, and every, like every single
03:42:10.40 --> 03:42:13.40 part of those jeans is American.
03:42:13.40 --> 03:42:14.40 Yeah.
03:42:14.40 --> 03:42:19.40 This is such an important, I want to bring it to a little bit of politics and how I view this
03:42:19.40 --> 03:42:28.40 and the need to, to embrace some sense of American economic nationalism, which we've
03:42:28.40 --> 03:42:29.40 lost over time.
03:42:29.40 --> 03:42:33.40 And the rise of Trump, when people ask about how the Republican party has changed under Trump,
03:42:33.40 --> 03:42:35.40 what they're, it's usually a disingenuous question.
03:42:35.40 --> 03:42:39.40 What they want you to say is that Republicans are racist, right?
03:42:39.40 --> 03:42:44.40 That's really what they're insinuating when they ask that question or that they're more racist now.
03:42:44.40 --> 03:42:45.40 That's not true.
03:42:45.40 --> 03:42:47.40 But there is some change.
03:42:47.40 --> 03:42:53.40 And this, this drive towards a, to, to a conversation about economic nationalism is actually part of that change.
03:42:53.40 --> 03:42:54.40 And it's been interesting to watch.
03:42:54.40 --> 03:42:56.40 And I think it's a necessary change.
03:42:56.40 --> 03:42:59.40 Because what Trump got was a lot of democrat voters who,
03:42:59.40 --> 03:43:04.40 maybe voted, democrat their whole life, but they're part of a union, culturally speaking,
03:43:04.40 --> 03:43:09.40 they identify a hell of a lot more with me than they do AOC.
03:43:09.40 --> 03:43:10.40 Okay.
03:43:10.40 --> 03:43:12.40 So they started voting based on that.
03:43:12.40 --> 03:43:16.40 But also, Trump finally talked about some things they were concerned about, which was like,
03:43:16.40 --> 03:43:22.40 China, okay, China, taking advantage of us, NAFTA, taking advantage of us.
03:43:22.40 --> 03:43:26.40 And the reality is that's, that's a, that's a nuanced conversation.
03:43:26.40 --> 03:43:31.40 It's not, it's not, it's different for every factory to be honest.
03:43:31.40 --> 03:43:34.40 It's, sometimes it's the business itself that sucked.
03:43:34.40 --> 03:43:37.40 Sometimes it is Chinese dumping that occurred.
03:43:37.40 --> 03:43:38.40 All right.
03:43:38.40 --> 03:43:40.40 Sometimes it, it's just, it's a mix of things.
03:43:40.40 --> 03:43:48.40 But Republicans for too long, it here to, to a, to a highly stringent free market economy,
03:43:48.40 --> 03:43:51.40 dogmatic approach, which said,
03:43:51.40 --> 03:43:54.40 if another country can make it cheaper, they should make it.
03:43:54.40 --> 03:43:57.40 All right. That's just, that's economics 101, we're done.
03:43:57.40 --> 03:43:59.40 No more thinking about it.
03:43:59.40 --> 03:44:01.40 Well, that's, that's not that simple.
03:44:01.40 --> 03:44:05.40 Like, there's winners and losers here, just because like tomatoes are now five cents cheaper for everybody,
03:44:05.40 --> 03:44:07.40 doesn't mean that we're all better off.
03:44:07.40 --> 03:44:10.40 You know, we've thousands of farmers that no longer make tomatoes.
03:44:10.40 --> 03:44:12.40 Also, we don't make tomatoes.
03:44:12.40 --> 03:44:15.40 And now, by the way, again, let's bring back some coronavirus,
03:44:15.40 --> 03:44:19.40 we've got a real conversation in this country to have about medical device,
03:44:19.40 --> 03:44:23.40 manufacturing and supply lines of our medical industry.
03:44:23.40 --> 03:44:25.40 And computer industry and everything else.
03:44:25.40 --> 03:44:30.40 Like, there is benefit, even if it costs us more, there is benefit to having that here in America.
03:44:30.40 --> 03:44:35.40 It's a real benefit, not just the job, the manufacturing jobs are certainly some of those benefits,
03:44:35.40 --> 03:44:38.40 but there's a national security reason as well.
03:44:38.40 --> 03:44:44.40 And it's about time we have a more honest conversation about that as Republicans.
03:44:44.40 --> 03:44:46.40 Democrats will just be against Trump no matter what.
03:44:46.40 --> 03:44:49.40 So like, because they don't, they're not really principled in this.
03:44:49.40 --> 03:44:53.40 They're mostly about seeking power for the sake of the revolution.
03:44:53.40 --> 03:44:55.40 And I could go way back into that again.
03:44:55.40 --> 03:45:03.40 But, and so, you know, I, we just, I think that's an interesting point.
03:45:03.40 --> 03:45:05.40 Is, is where I want to end that.
03:45:05.40 --> 03:45:06.40 And so I love what you guys are doing.
03:45:06.40 --> 03:45:08.40 I guess is what I'm really trying to say.
03:45:08.40 --> 03:45:10.40 Yeah, well, it's, and you know, we got this right now.
03:45:10.40 --> 03:45:12.40 Again, you're talking coronavirus.
03:45:12.40 --> 03:45:14.40 We got 100% American supply chain.
03:45:14.40 --> 03:45:16.40 So zero impact.
03:45:16.40 --> 03:45:20.40 Zero impact. It's, it's just, it's, it's awesome.
03:45:20.40 --> 03:45:25.40 And yeah, you're talking about the, the Chinese are making a bunch of the, what 95% of the pharmaceuticals are something crazy.
03:45:25.40 --> 03:45:26.40 There's crazy number like that.
03:45:26.40 --> 03:45:27.40 Yeah.
03:45:27.40 --> 03:45:28.40 That's not okay.
03:45:28.40 --> 03:45:29.40 That's not okay.
03:45:29.40 --> 03:45:33.40 And yeah, if you save five cents on something, that's not okay when something happens.
03:45:33.40 --> 03:45:38.40 Even if it was, even if it was just a natural disaster that, that caused problems over there.
03:45:38.40 --> 03:45:40.40 You know, no, no political anything.
03:45:40.40 --> 03:45:42.40 That's a real problem.
03:45:42.40 --> 03:45:48.40 And to, to have single source for life, life saving capabilities, that's a bad plan.
03:45:48.40 --> 03:45:53.40 And hopefully we look back at this coronavirus and we say, hey, I'm glad we got a heads up.
03:45:53.40 --> 03:45:55.40 I'm glad we got a free lesson.
03:45:55.40 --> 03:45:58.40 Relatively cheap lessons learned about this.
03:45:58.40 --> 03:46:02.40 So anyways, up in Maine, doing it.
03:46:02.40 --> 03:46:03.40 We're doing it.
03:46:03.40 --> 03:46:04.40 We're doing it right now.
03:46:04.40 --> 03:46:05.40 We've been doing it.
03:46:05.40 --> 03:46:07.40 And we're going to continue to grow.
03:46:07.40 --> 03:46:09.40 We're going to continue to get out the best products.
03:46:09.40 --> 03:46:12.40 We're going to do that.
03:46:12.40 --> 03:46:14.40 We're going to continue to grow.
03:46:14.40 --> 03:46:17.40 So we can supplement to supplementation as as aquatiles like to call it.
03:46:17.40 --> 03:46:18.40 True.
03:46:18.40 --> 03:46:19.40 From time to time.
03:46:19.40 --> 03:46:22.40 So for supplementation, what?
03:46:22.40 --> 03:46:23.40 Join supplement.
03:46:23.40 --> 03:46:24.40 Very important.
03:46:24.40 --> 03:46:25.40 By the way, yeah.
03:46:25.40 --> 03:46:26.40 Join.
03:46:26.40 --> 03:46:27.40 I should probably take some of this.
03:46:27.40 --> 03:46:27.40 Yeah.
03:46:27.40 --> 03:46:29.40 I brought what you can do like if you joins don't work.
03:46:29.40 --> 03:46:30.40 Yeah, not much.
03:46:30.40 --> 03:46:31.40 Just get new ones.
03:46:31.40 --> 03:46:32.40 Yeah.
03:46:32.40 --> 03:46:33.40 Yep, there's that technology.
03:46:33.40 --> 03:46:35.40 By the way, yeah.
03:46:35.40 --> 03:46:36.40 Also.
03:46:36.40 --> 03:46:37.40 Moq.
03:46:37.40 --> 03:46:39.000 It's more of a dessert.
03:46:39.000 --> 03:46:42.40 It's a dessert that happens to have a bunch of protein in it,
03:46:42.40 --> 03:46:44.20 and probiotics, and it has no sugar
03:46:44.20 --> 03:46:46.68 and it's super healthy and it tastes delicious.
03:46:46.68 --> 03:46:49.40 Technology, it's skeptical of the delicious part.
03:46:49.40 --> 03:46:50.64 That's what's crazy.
03:46:50.64 --> 03:46:51.64 I love dessert.
03:46:51.64 --> 03:46:53.04 That's what's crazy.
03:46:53.04 --> 03:46:53.88 That's what's crazy.
03:46:53.88 --> 03:46:55.92 That's what has got so many people,
03:46:55.92 --> 03:46:58.16 officially on the malt train.
03:46:58.16 --> 03:46:59.76 I train so much dessert.
03:46:59.76 --> 03:47:03.000 I will send you what flavor of these flavors,
03:47:03.000 --> 03:47:07.60 chocolate, vanilla, mint chocolate chip,
03:47:07.60 --> 03:47:09.56 which is my personal favorite.
03:47:09.56 --> 03:47:11.76 Reces peanut butter cup, and I know I can't call it that,
03:47:11.76 --> 03:47:12.72 but that's what it tastes like.
03:47:12.72 --> 03:47:13.88 Peanut butter chocolate, what's that?
03:47:13.88 --> 03:47:14.72 Peanut butter chocolate.
03:47:14.72 --> 03:47:16.04 I'll pick the peanut butter chocolate.
03:47:16.04 --> 03:47:18.52 And then here's the one that's kind of the creeper,
03:47:18.52 --> 03:47:20.24 or the, what's it called?
03:47:20.24 --> 03:47:21.08 Creep?
03:47:21.08 --> 03:47:21.92 No, the sleeper.
03:47:21.92 --> 03:47:23.64 The sleeper is strawberry.
03:47:24.48 --> 03:47:27.000 So did you ever have strawberry quick when you were a kid?
03:47:27.000 --> 03:47:27.84 Yeah.
03:47:27.84 --> 03:47:28.68 Did you write it?
03:47:28.68 --> 03:47:29.52 Yes.
03:47:29.52 --> 03:47:30.68 Okay, I'm not kidding.
03:47:30.68 --> 03:47:33.08 I'm not kidding.
03:47:33.08 --> 03:47:38.08 Strawberry moch tastes better than strawberry quick.
03:47:38.08 --> 03:47:39.12 No.
03:47:39.12 --> 03:47:41.52 I'm telling you like a competitive,
03:47:41.52 --> 03:47:42.68 is it a liquid way?
03:47:42.68 --> 03:47:45.40 Can we back, because my preference for flavor
03:47:45.40 --> 03:47:47.96 does depend on the substance that we have.
03:47:47.96 --> 03:47:49.36 Yeah, it's like a milk shake.
03:47:49.36 --> 03:47:50.76 Milk shake, it's like a milk shake.
03:47:50.76 --> 03:47:52.52 It's like a milk shake or a chocolate milk or a,
03:47:52.52 --> 03:47:53.56 or a nest is quick.
03:47:53.56 --> 03:47:54.56 Okay.
03:47:54.56 --> 03:47:55.76 Well, you can make the strawberry.
03:47:55.76 --> 03:47:56.60 What?
03:47:56.60 --> 03:47:57.56 You can make pink pink.
03:47:57.56 --> 03:47:58.84 You can put milk in pretty much anything.
03:47:58.84 --> 03:48:02.92 Okay, okay, so based on the fact that it's more like a milk shake,
03:48:02.92 --> 03:48:05.48 then I would, yeah, then I would say not the peanut butter.
03:48:05.48 --> 03:48:06.92 I do like peanut butter milk shake,
03:48:06.92 --> 03:48:08.92 but that's more of an ice cream than I'm, I'm favorite.
03:48:08.92 --> 03:48:10.08 Okay.
03:48:10.08 --> 03:48:11.84 So can we have milk ice cream?
03:48:11.84 --> 03:48:12.84 Is that a thing?
03:48:12.84 --> 03:48:17.56 We have things in process for the milk ice cream.
03:48:17.56 --> 03:48:19.24 And did you have some at camp?
03:48:19.24 --> 03:48:20.08 Yes, sir.
03:48:20.08 --> 03:48:22.92 Okay, so yeah, we have milk ice cream.
03:48:22.92 --> 03:48:25.24 We need to move forward on an logistics.
03:48:25.24 --> 03:48:26.24 That's a heavy logistics.
03:48:26.24 --> 03:48:27.92 You know, you're talking about shipping frozen fruits, et cetera.
03:48:27.92 --> 03:48:29.28 So we're moving in that direction.
03:48:29.28 --> 03:48:30.12 We're not there yet.
03:48:30.12 --> 03:48:30.96 We're working on it.
03:48:30.96 --> 03:48:31.80 Gotcha.
03:48:31.80 --> 03:48:34.84 It's, we have milk bars coming, which,
03:48:34.84 --> 03:48:38.28 what's it get totally ridiculous, totally ridiculous.
03:48:38.28 --> 03:48:40.08 I'm changing your stuff.
03:48:40.08 --> 03:48:41.24 So strawberry then.
03:48:41.24 --> 03:48:42.92 Yeah, no, we'll get to the line.
03:48:42.92 --> 03:48:44.12 Yeah, the whole deal of the whole line.
03:48:44.12 --> 03:48:45.08 So you'll just be, you'll be,
03:48:45.08 --> 03:48:46.36 sometimes you're going to be in the woods for men,
03:48:46.36 --> 03:48:47.52 sometimes you're going to be in the woods for, you know,
03:48:47.52 --> 03:48:49.60 strawberry, I've got to say two.
03:48:49.60 --> 03:48:51.56 Oh yeah, those milk bars, you're going to,
03:48:51.56 --> 03:48:52.52 it's funny because, you know,
03:48:52.52 --> 03:48:55.08 how kids are the kind of the litmus test, you know, like,
03:48:55.08 --> 03:48:56.96 if you give the kid like,
03:48:56.96 --> 03:48:58.24 let's say back in the day, right?
03:48:58.24 --> 03:48:59.84 You got your diet, shake.
03:48:59.84 --> 03:49:01.20 And then it's like kids to get out.
03:49:01.20 --> 03:49:02.04 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
03:49:02.04 --> 03:49:02.76 And you just give it to the kid,
03:49:02.76 --> 03:49:04.24 the kids like, brought him like this.
03:49:04.24 --> 03:49:06.96 Like, you know, I, I dig it or whatever.
03:49:06.96 --> 03:49:07.88 They don't just don't like.
03:49:07.88 --> 03:49:10.56 So my, and I have a video of this, where my son,
03:49:10.56 --> 03:49:13.08 three, by the way, which is a solid little test group.
03:49:13.08 --> 03:49:13.96 Get a good experiment.
03:49:13.96 --> 03:49:14.96 Yeah, yeah.
03:49:14.96 --> 03:49:16.72 Cause he doesn't have morals or nothing like that.
03:49:16.72 --> 03:49:18.28 So he's just, he'll tell you the truth.
03:49:18.28 --> 03:49:19.12 Yeah, that's what I mean.
03:49:19.12 --> 03:49:20.88 Like he didn't care about your feelings or whatever.
03:49:20.88 --> 03:49:22.76 So yeah, I have a video of him
03:49:22.76 --> 03:49:24.48 champion a moq bar.
03:49:24.48 --> 03:49:25.32 Yeah.
03:49:25.32 --> 03:49:26.64 I didn't give him a moq bar.
03:49:26.64 --> 03:49:28.64 And he's like, oh yeah, he just chucked the chocolate bar,
03:49:28.64 --> 03:49:29.48 whatever.
03:49:29.48 --> 03:49:30.68 And I was like, what are you eating?
03:49:30.68 --> 03:49:32.88 And he's like, yeah, frozen chocolate bar.
03:49:32.88 --> 03:49:36.04 And here's the thing, I put those in the freezer to hide them.
03:49:36.04 --> 03:49:37.24 And he went in there, shake it.
03:49:37.24 --> 03:49:38.08 Shake it down.
03:49:38.08 --> 03:49:41.04 With motivation, obviously, you're seeing same taste buds.
03:49:41.04 --> 03:49:43.48 Is the number one motivating factor in this case.
03:49:43.48 --> 03:49:44.08 Yeah.
03:49:44.08 --> 03:49:45.36 Anyway, so that was the test.
03:49:45.36 --> 03:49:46.08 That's the most bar though.
03:49:46.08 --> 03:49:47.44 I don't want to get too ahead of myself.
03:49:47.44 --> 03:49:48.04 Yeah, yeah.
03:49:48.04 --> 03:49:50.16 We'll stick with the moq for now.

03:53:49.68 --> 03:53:55.68 We may be getting some, what do you think Dan, what do you think the chances are?

03:53:56.68 --> 03:54:01.76 I mean, experts think, you know, this is a change in America life that will last a month
03:54:01.76 --> 03:54:02.76 or two.
03:54:02.76 --> 03:54:03.92 And then we'll be on the downtrend.
03:54:03.92 --> 03:54:08.76 We can look at the numbers coming out of China and South Korea as perhaps a guide
03:54:08.76 --> 03:54:11.96 as to how the decrease in cases happens.
03:54:11.96 --> 03:54:17.88 Hopefully, we don't even reach the peaks that they did get to be seen.
03:54:17.88 --> 03:54:20.68 Plus we got social distancing slowing down the curve.

03:54:22.68 --> 03:54:26.92 Basically, if you hang around echo, echo thinks that he's sort of a national hero right now
03:54:26.92 --> 03:54:29.72 because he's not shaking people's hands.
03:54:29.72 --> 03:54:33.28 He's sort of taken on, you know, you're talking about the typical hero.
03:54:33.28 --> 03:54:34.72 I think we had echo Charles over there.
03:54:34.72 --> 03:54:37.56 He's sacrificing his own hugs.
03:54:37.56 --> 03:54:38.56 His own hugs.
03:54:38.56 --> 03:54:39.56 So I'm not even, yeah.

03:55:56.68 --> 03:55:57.68 It's been fun.
03:55:57.68 --> 03:55:58.68 Yeah.
03:55:58.68 --> 03:55:59.96 A little longer than we thought.
03:55:59.96 --> 03:56:00.96 It happened.
03:56:00.96 --> 03:56:01.96 We got a lot to say.
03:56:01.96 --> 03:56:02.96 Man.
03:56:02.96 --> 03:56:04.80 Some tangential things.
03:56:04.80 --> 03:56:05.80 But all good.
03:56:05.80 --> 03:56:09.000 Thanks for coming back on.
03:56:09.000 --> 03:56:10.84 Thanks for sharing your life story and your lessons.
03:56:10.84 --> 03:56:15.16 I'm not just here, but in the book and I know people are going to thank you for the book.
03:56:15.16 --> 03:56:18.28 I am going to thank you and everyone.
03:56:18.28 --> 03:56:22.52 Thanks you for your service and your sacrifice.
03:56:22.52 --> 03:56:26.04 Not only on the battlefield, but now you're fighting a different kind of battle.
03:56:26.04 --> 03:56:27.84 You know, you and I talk offline.
03:56:27.84 --> 03:56:32.80 I told you twice once on the phone and once when you showed up here, I'm really glad that
03:56:32.80 --> 03:56:33.80 you have your job.
03:56:33.80 --> 03:56:34.80 I have mine.
03:56:34.80 --> 03:56:41.48 Your job is not one that I would want and not fun, but you're doing it for the right
03:56:41.48 --> 03:56:42.48 reasons.
03:56:42.48 --> 03:56:47.88 And I think everyone appreciates the fact that you're fighting a battle for the future
03:56:47.88 --> 03:56:48.88 of America.
03:56:48.88 --> 03:56:54.48 So that America remains now and forever.
03:56:54.48 --> 03:56:58.36 The land of the free and the home of the brave.
03:56:58.36 --> 03:57:01.84 And the same goes to the rest of our service men and women out there.
03:57:01.84 --> 03:57:06.76 Film is not free and someone has to hold the line.
03:57:06.76 --> 03:57:12.40 And it is all of you soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines out there who keep evil and
03:57:12.40 --> 03:57:14.16 darkness at bay.
03:57:14.16 --> 03:57:15.16 And we thank you for that.
03:57:15.16 --> 03:57:19.000 And the same thing goes to our police and law enforcement and firefighters and paramedics
03:57:19.000 --> 03:57:23.92 and EMTs and dispatchers and correctional officers and board of patrol and secret service.
03:57:23.92 --> 03:57:25.68 Same thing.
03:57:25.68 --> 03:57:27.16 Freedom isn't free.
03:57:27.16 --> 03:57:31.80 It takes sacrifice and thanks to all of you for what you do every day.
03:57:31.80 --> 03:57:37.44 To take care of us and keep our country free and to everyone else out there.
03:57:37.44 --> 03:57:40.84 Life is a struggle.
03:57:40.84 --> 03:57:42.04 It's a challenge.
03:57:42.04 --> 03:57:45.40 It's suffering.
03:57:45.40 --> 03:57:48.32 And you're not always going to win.
03:57:48.32 --> 03:57:51.72 But even when you don't win, as Dan says, don't quit.
03:57:51.72 --> 03:57:52.72 Don't give up.
03:57:52.72 --> 03:57:54.60 Don't be a victim.
03:57:54.60 --> 03:57:56.80 Don't take the easy path.
03:57:56.80 --> 03:57:59.52 Don't squander this life.
03:57:59.52 --> 03:58:05.52 Instead live with fortitude.
03:58:05.52 --> 03:58:11.48 By getting up every day, then getting after it.
03:58:11.48 --> 03:58:34.44 And until next time, this is Dan Crenshaw and Echo and Jocco out.
