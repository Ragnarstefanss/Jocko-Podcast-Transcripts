00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000 This is Jocopontcast number 171.
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000 With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000 Good evening, echo.
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000 Good evening.
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:19.000 I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the constitution of the United States
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000 against all enemies foreign and domestic.
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000 That I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, and that I will obey the orders
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000 of the president of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me,
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000 according to the regulations and the uniform code of military justice.
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000 So help me, God.
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:55.000 And that is the oath of enlistment that is made by every US military member.
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000 In the other day, I was at a charity event for America's mighty warriors, which is an organization
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:12.000 that was created by Mrs. Debbie Mamale, the mother of Mark Lee, from Task Unit
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000 Bruser, who was the first seal killed in action in Iraq, and it was a great event.
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000 It was an honor to be there, and I spent some time answering questions from some of the people
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000 that had come out to the event.
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000 And one of the individuals asked a question about the fact that he had served in the Marines
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000 during the 90s, during a time of peace.
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000 And he didn't go into combat and he didn't go to war.
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000 And he actually felt guilty about that.
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000 He felt that he hadn't done enough.
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000 And I told him the truth and the truth is that he had done what his country had asked him to do.
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000 That's what he had done.
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000 And if the country had needed him to give more, then he would have given more.
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000 That is what the oath of enlistment is.
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000 And it's one of if not the most powerful oath that a person can give,
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:25.000 because when you take that oath, if you take that oath, you are putting your country above all else.
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000 Above your family, above your future, above your life, above yourself.
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000 And with that oath, when you take that oath, if your country needs you to sacrifice, you will sacrifice.
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000 And if the country needs your time, you will give it your time.
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000 And if it needs even more than that, then you will give it even more.
00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:00.000 And the good soldier, sailor, airman, or marine, the service men and women who defend this nation.
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000 They will sacrifice, and they will give until they have nothing left.
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.000 And it is my honor tonight to have someone on the podcast that has sacrificed incredibly for our great nation.
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000 And yet his attitude remains completely unwavering.
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000 He drives on and sets an example for everyone.
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:41.000 An example of pure fortitude and tenacity, and one that fully represents the motto of the hollowed brotherhood.
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000 He will always be a part of.
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000 And that's the United States Marine Corps and their proud Maxim Semperfidelis always faithful.
00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.000 I've been working to make this podcast happen for a long time and tonight I am grateful to have this hero with us.
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000 A man by the name of Matthew Bradford.
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000 Matt, welcome to the show.
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000 Thanks for having me on, Jocco.
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000 This is something else to be sitting in front of you right now because it's been a lot of remarkable people that's been on this podcast.
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000 And it's a true honor to be here in front of you and echo and get the chance to meet you all.
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000 Yeah, and I know we've been working on making this happen for a while.
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.000 So I'm glad we finally were able to get you and your family on a plane flown out here where we can, when we can sit down and talk for a little bit.
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000 And then you can get back with your family and go have some good dimes.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000 And it sounds like you're going to have good temperatures are giving you a little heads up.
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000 It can be a little warm here in Anheim.
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000 If you're not careful, come out here in the summertime.
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000 You, uh, you'll you'll get baked out there in the in the in the in the Disney land.
00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000 My, my pacey white skin and I'm hard head.
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000 So I don't like putting sunscreen on.
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000 So I learned the hard way.
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000 Yeah, well, if we guys be all right.
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000 Um, all right.
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000 So let's just go.
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000 Let's go to the beginning growing up.
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000 What that was like growing up in in Kentucky, in Virginia.
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000 What was that all about?
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000 Yes, I was born in Petersburg, Virginia.
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000 My dad, he worked at Fort Lee at the defense commissary agency.
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000 And, you know, in early age, my parents got divorced.
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000 So I moved to live with my mom in Kentucky, where all of my family's from.
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000 And even today when people ask me where I'm from, Kentucky is just easiest answer.
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000 And, you know, throughout my childhood, like we moved so much.
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000 I learned a lot because my mom, she worked paycheck to paycheck.
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000 So I learned a lot about, you know, how to appreciate things and to be thankful for things
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000 and not expect the bigger things.
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000 And, you know, through this, I learned to just go outside and view it with my friends
00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000 and never expect, you know, a big Christmas or, but I knew one thing from my mom and from my set dad
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000 and even my family around me, the one thing they showed me in the rest of our, was love.
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000 And it taught me a lot about life at an early age.
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:19.000 And, you know, it's through all the moving around, but, you know, in Kentucky, the one thing with Kentucky is they have a lot of, they're drug problems.
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000 So it's getting out and playing sports and getting away from that helped out a lot.
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000 And, you know, all of this happened in 2001.
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:35.000 And, that's when I realized it was a ninth grade in, as a freshman in high school, as when I felt like it was my purpose to serve this country in the military,
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000 even though I was a freshman in high school.
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000 So, in their watching, you know, the terrorist attacks go on in New York City and the Pentagon.
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000 And, I felt like it was my time.
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000 Go home and nobody was on the streets, nobody was playing basketball or football or whatever the sport of the time was.
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000 Everybody was inside watching the news.
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000 And, also through that, you know, my mom and my set dad was going through some things as their own.
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000 And, and, that's when thankfully my dad stepped in.
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000 And, my dad said, you're coming to live with me now.
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.000 And, that was the greatest decision ever because although I love Kentucky, I don't know where I would be at the day if my dad didn't step in and, you know, pull me towards him and Virginia.
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:25.000 And, moving to Virginia after my freshman year in high school and staying there for three years, you know, living right next to a army base and visiting the army base daily.
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.000 I got to change to see what, what, what the willingness to serve, you know, the patriotism and all this stuff.
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000 And, it really kind of boosts it my, my motive to serve more and more.
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000 So, when you were, when you were in Kentucky and you were a freshman,
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000 had you thought about the military prior to September 11th?
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000 Grow up at Kentucky, the only thing that I wanted to do was play basketball for the university of Kentucky.
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000 That was, I mean, that's the one thing.
00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000 You know, you'd go out on the street or you'd play video games, which then was the old school play session.
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.000 You just wanted to play basketball for Kentucky. There was nothing else and 2001 happened.
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000 And that's when kind of like it got in my mind, that's why I wanted to do.
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000 And then during that time, blackhawk down come out as the movie and I just watched that over and over again.
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:22.000 And I was like, I want to be a ranger. I want to serve, you know, and then it went from the army to I looked into the air force special forces and there.
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000 Their special forces is way too long because I wanted to deploy and I actually ran into the Marine Corps recruiter at Fort Lee, playing basketball.
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000 And he took us to Hooters. And that's very sold me. Was it Hooters?
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:44.000 That's good, I guess. It doesn't take, you know, for me when the Marine Corps recruiting is awesome.
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.000 And I heard this fact a long time ago that the Marine Corps spends the least amount of money on recruiting, but has the best results.
00:08:51.000 --> 00:09:00.000 Because they just have their, well, they have the Marine Corps. They have the Marine Corps persona behind them, the legend of the Marine Corps.
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.000 And that, I remember, you know, when I was a kid, there was a guy that I knew that was a drill instructor and he was older than me, but, you know, occasionally he'd come home.
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000 And I would just think, well, obviously, that's what I'm going to do.
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.000 There's no doubt in your mind, you know, you just see these human beings that are above and beyond anything you've ever really seen before.
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:27.000 And you go, that's, you know, when you're 10 years old and you see a Marine Corps drone instructor, that's it. That's a damn impressive sight.
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000 That is an impressive sight.
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.000 Especially when you see the dress blue is walking to the cafeteria at school and with all the medals and the ribbons and it's like, this is what I want to be.
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:48.000 And, and because growing up, like, on my mom's side, my grandpa served and, and on my dad's side, a lot of his family served in the military and I never realized the military was
00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:02.000 you know, in my future, but looking back on it now because I've been asked this question if you've ever, if you just think it's, you know, was set up for you to join the military and as many people in my family that served, I kind of, you know, to answer the question now.
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:15.000 I thought it was my time to serve and, but I mean, just the Marine Corps alone, it's, you know, it wasn't my first choice because I just wanted to serve, but I tell you what, it's, it was the greatest decision ever made my life as a 18 year old.
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:38.000 You know, the December of my senior year in high school, go into the Mepsation and, you know, taking that, that oath and getting the date to go to boot camp to recruit training and all I had to do was just give my recruiter my diploma and then, you know, the bus and there I go and, it's surprisingly the first day of school, the next year is when I was on a bus stepping on those yellow footprints and getting screamed at.
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:53.000 So you decided you were going to join after September 11th and that was your freshman year, then you go from Kentucky to Virginia and, but you're, are you focused all the time now you're just ending up I'm going in the military as soon as I get done with high school.
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000 That's where your mindset was.
00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:05.000 That was, I was at, at my grades were bare minimum to average just to stay on a sports team and because all I knew was to my recruiter needed my diploma that was it.
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:17.000 And believe me, there was some classes that I struggled with and I didn't know if I was going to give him that diploma or not, but mainly English seconds semester my senior year that was, but it was, it was my mindset.
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000 That's what I wanted to do. I didn't think he'd think about going to college. I just wanted to serve in the military.
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000 Yeah, that's, there's something.
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:36.000 I don't know, you know, I got, I got a bunch of teenage kids. I got two daughters and one son that our teenagers all right now and then I got a little girl, but.
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:45.000 For kids these days, a lot of them are programmed that what you do when you get done with high school is you go to college and this and that's not for everybody.
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:54.000 It really is and for me it certainly wasn't it's something I wanted to be. I was like, oh, I, I wish I could have joined the military when I was like 13.
00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:08.000 Because because I would have just been such a much better person. You know, so all right, you, you struggle a little bit in school in English apparently.
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000 Definitely.
00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000 What sports did you play?
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000 I play football. I played basketball a little bit and pretty much played all sports.
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:25.000 I'm not for school related, but little league baseball. And then my wife likes to make fun of me by a play basketball tennis from sophomore to senior year and I went out there.
00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:34.000 The first practice, my body that kind of like recruited me to come play and the coach was like, hey, how about you two just go down there and play a bunch of sophomores kind of get it all our way.
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:50.000 And I beat him eight nothing. He got so mad. It was so funny and like walking or down. Walkin back to the other side of the courts and hearing the other players like, oh my gosh, he just beat him eight nothing and the guy had read here in his face was just as red as his hair.
00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:16.000 And you know, like, I was junior year, I was the one seed on both singles and doubles and went pretty far in the district and you know, senior year was the same and it was just something that enjoyed to do in the spring time and it was and honestly it's very did it get you run so much that you got to be athletic and you got to be in shape and that helped out a lot to you know football on the fall and then tennis and the spring.
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.000 And then and so what year did you graduate? 2005. And then you left in September of 2005 you leave for boot camp.
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:32.000 I did. Yeah, graduated in June and left in September. So a couple months in between and that's the one thing like in high school.
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:44.000 There was a couple of Marines or a couple of guys that I graduated with. We graduated on Friday and they went to boot camp on Monday and they're the ones that kind of kind of kind of helped me kind of really.
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000 Realize that the Marine Corps is what I wanted to do even though it's kind of what I was focused on.
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000 When did you when did you sign a contract at maps December of 2004?
00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:03.000 Okay, so you had a little delayed entry delayed entry program. And it's just worried about what they're going to do after high school and you're like I'm going to party all summer long.
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000 And then I'm going to Marine Corps boot camp. How much of a shock to your system was it when you got some Marine Corps boot camp?
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:20.000 The first three days was I mean it's it was just so much like you know, of course, you don't sleep at all and it's just as constant yelling and you're realizing like what in the world did I do.
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:36.000 Did you can only watch it on videos and understand it's like okay, that's on a TV screen and that's not real life, but it was something else getting you know, I guess a range it up every every time the bus goes through parasol and they're going to stand on the yellow foot prints and mill the night and
00:14:36.000 --> 00:15:01.000 Of course, that's when we got off and I was is a 12 passenger van and I was kind of in the middle seat and I had to go through the seat belt to get out. I'm getting yelled at so I'm like choking myself with the seat belt and you know we get to the yellow foot prints and it's like you're standing there and position of attention and it's like your calf started tightening up and you started just like oh my gosh, what did I do? Why did I sign this paper work again?
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:14.000 I think the funniest thing was when we actually went on to parasol and how this this van from Virginia down to parasol and eight hours just joking talking the minute we pass the gate it just got silent.
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:29.000 And they were you know and then you're going back like when I because I turned 18 my senior year in August and I did a late in true program or I you know what the maps December and when I would come home in December and my dad was like so what'd you do?
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:50.000 And I was like I signed up for infantry in the Marine Corps and he was like you know what infantry does right and it's like I do and this is the time like in my room I had the big Marine Corps poster with the three Marines and their dress blues I think it was the guy and the female and it was like it took up the whole wall and I was I was dedicated to the core then and I was so excited to
00:15:50.000 --> 00:16:07.000 raise my hand and then go to school the next day wearing my Meps Marine Corps t-shirt. I was like this is it I'm perfect. Yeah, you know, I'm talking around all the Marine Corps shirts I'd go to the mall and I'm walking around my shoulders all cocked back and like this is it.
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:26.000 And that's awesome. I was trying to because there's been quite a few people have joined the military from listening to the podcast and now whenever I talk about this I was trying to tell them that for at least the first two weeks they're going to hate me they're going to hate the military they're going to a bouquet but it's going to seem like the worst decision they ever made.
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:40.000 I actually was speaking on the USS George Washington in Japan in 2009 and this sailor walked up to me and he's like, I just got the phone with my dad and tell him I'm reading listen up there and you speak and I'm like, oh gosh you didn't give me my name did you?
00:16:40.000 --> 00:17:09.98 But yeah check so you go through boot camp and you get done and you knew you were going infantry the whole time right I did I knew I was infantry and you know in 2005 I feel like we had about 70 75 recruits in our platoon and majority of them were going infantry and the funny thing is that in our squad bay and our senior drill instructor he was he was setting front of us talking to us up on the quarter deck and he's like I got
00:17:09.98 --> 00:17:37.98 one more class after you all and then once I'm done I'm going Hawaii and I'll never see you little you little puke again and you kind of just like blow that off it's like okay he's going Hawaii I'm more than likely at East Coast Marines so I'm going to say a camp was noon and do my time there and hopefully never run into him but then you experience the small Marine Corps gets a lot smaller and you know once we got the SOI graduated from there and
00:17:37.98 --> 00:17:54.30 they told us that a select few of us from Alpha Company School of Infantry would be going to Hawaii be stationed with second time third Marines and the select few of us was our whole company in the company that next the Bravo company so they dropped us off in Hawaii and you go through there and
00:17:54.30 --> 00:18:07.30 is that normal for like a whole company from SOI to go together to a battalion somewhere? I did think so I thought you know you know in the Marine Corps it's like east of the Mississippi you're pretty much going to stay all together
00:18:07.30 --> 00:18:18.14 but I thought they would kind of disperse you out through different battalions and thankfully they've everybody like a lot of the guys that I want the boot camp with was in the same battalion as me and Hawaii so like I
00:18:18.14 --> 00:18:25.74 created that friendship and that brotherhood from the start of the Marine Corps and carried it with me along the way and I was glad because you know it's
00:18:25.74 --> 00:18:33.42 growing up in Kentucky in Virginia I didn't want to be stationed in Luzoon or the East Coast and you know they gave me this little wishlist which I don't think they even look at
00:18:33.42 --> 00:18:41.90 I think they was given to you because it's checking the box but yeah I picked I picked Okinawa in Camp Pendleton as my first two choices and they pretty much put me right in the middle
00:18:41.90 --> 00:18:48.86 Hawaii and the difference I always felt people a free government trip to Hawaii I mean I can't complain about that at all so
00:18:48.86 --> 00:18:56.78 how was the school of infantry it was cold in North Carolina we were during that time there were so many guys going through the through
00:18:56.78 --> 00:19:04.38 infantry school and a lot of guys were just like there for a couple months three months and you know like you go to the
00:19:04.38 --> 00:19:11.34 childhood and you got a like a 10 to 20 like a snake line of rose and rose of Marines going to try to eat
00:19:11.34 --> 00:19:16.78 child and I was so close to actually call my recruiter to go and recruit assistance because I didn't know
00:19:16.78 --> 00:19:23.18 how much longer I'd be here and thankfully my last name starts with the bee and so so January I got
00:19:23.18 --> 00:19:29.90 selected and put an alpha company and the first three weeks is just kind of learning the whole weapon systems and working on you know
00:19:29.90 --> 00:19:36.46 going on humps and stuff and and then the next three weeks was basically out in the field the whole time doing infantry work and
00:19:36.46 --> 00:19:41.90 clearing you know learn how to clear rooms and do a lot of Mount training and at this point you're
00:19:42.62 --> 00:19:48.70 did you guys all pretty much assume you're going to Iraq or Afghanistan 100% I mean being an infantryman in the Marine Corps
00:19:48.70 --> 00:19:55.18 there's a war in two countries you must have all just realized you're 100% going pretty much and
00:19:55.18 --> 00:19:59.90 that's the reason why I wanted to choose infantry because I wanted to blow it as quickly as I possibly could and
00:20:00.94 --> 00:20:06.14 you know two of my drill instructors were purple heart recipients from the battle falucia and so it's like you
00:20:06.14 --> 00:20:10.46 kind of you kind of hear it from all the drill instructors when you're going through recruit training that you know
00:20:10.46 --> 00:20:14.38 this is where you're going to end up you know you go through your school and you go through your training but
00:20:14.38 --> 00:20:20.54 more than likely 99% of you are going to Iraq or Afghanistan. Were you thinking about that like you're on the
00:20:20.54 --> 00:20:26.38 range you're dialing in your weapon are you thinking yourself I better pay attention right now because
00:20:27.26 --> 00:20:33.66 I might be needing this skill in a couple months when I'm overseas. I don't think it ever like
00:20:33.66 --> 00:20:38.38 cross my mind because I just did what I was told to do you know and you know when it was on the
00:20:38.38 --> 00:20:42.86 rifle range or if it was like patrolling you know I tried to take in as much as I possibly could and
00:20:42.86 --> 00:20:49.50 learn as I went and you know the the more I learned I just you know I learned to not only teach
00:20:49.50 --> 00:20:55.02 myself but also teach those around me and stuff because I didn't you know you you only see it on the
00:20:55.02 --> 00:20:59.42 news you don't really know what to experience and it's funny because I tried to read the book
00:20:59.42 --> 00:21:06.22 no true glory and I couldn't really understand what Iraq was like you know from clearing rooms
00:21:06.22 --> 00:21:11.42 or trolling down the streets urban terrain I couldn't understand that because I wasn't there and you
00:21:11.42 --> 00:21:15.90 know of course now when I read these books I understand because I can visualize it in my head
00:21:15.90 --> 00:21:21.98 but you know then I was just doing what I was told and I was learning as I went along and
00:21:22.94 --> 00:21:26.38 you know I learned what I could through school of infantry and then once I got to the fleet it kind
00:21:26.38 --> 00:21:32.14 of changed a lot because we had to learn what the with our battalion and our squad and platoon was
00:21:32.14 --> 00:21:38.70 doing there. At the school of infantry did you do company sized operations of bit like
00:21:38.70 --> 00:21:45.66 clearances of villages and stuff like that? We we did towards the end of school of infantry we
00:21:45.66 --> 00:21:49.82 had we had all the elevenths out there and then we had the machine gunners and the mortarman
00:21:49.82 --> 00:21:56.70 would set up and we kind of we would we would home be in and you know we'd go in and clear a
00:21:56.70 --> 00:22:04.14 couple of homes and stuff like that and but it was more of a company level it's hard to remember
00:22:04.14 --> 00:22:08.86 back then but it was because it was the one thing in like North Carolina like where we were at
00:22:08.86 --> 00:22:12.78 trying it for a school of infantry which is a lot of like machine gun fields and a lot of like
00:22:12.78 --> 00:22:18.06 pop up targets and those kind of ranges and then the mount town wasn't as extensive as it was
00:22:18.06 --> 00:22:23.58 once we got to the fleet went to cax and California. So they so you would say at school of infantry
00:22:23.58 --> 00:22:29.02 you are more working on your individual's infantry skills more than like working together with the
00:22:29.02 --> 00:22:34.06 platoon or a company sized elements. I think so because a lot of times at school of infantry we did a
00:22:34.06 --> 00:22:38.70 lot of fire team stuff and you know we did a lot of hikes every Thursday once we got back
00:22:38.70 --> 00:22:43.10 from the field but a lot of it was like this learned weapons learning how to shoot a pop-up targets
00:22:43.10 --> 00:22:49.26 and like move in targets and just kind of like learn just kind of learn the whole weapons and
00:22:49.26 --> 00:22:56.86 systems and stuff. Every Marine is first and foremost a rifleman and that's where you become a rifleman.
00:22:56.86 --> 00:23:04.14 Okay so now you get assigned to two three Marines and you're you're head and off to Hawaii which is
00:23:04.14 --> 00:23:11.90 we're just coming from coming from Kentucky and in Virginia and the North Carolina and now
00:23:11.90 --> 00:23:17.50 I'll send you wake up near Hawaii. We were actually in the squad bay me a guy from Georgia and
00:23:17.50 --> 00:23:21.34 the other guy from Tennessee and we were listening to Craig Morgan's Redneck Yacht Club. I think
00:23:21.34 --> 00:23:25.66 and this is what we're gonna do when we get to Hawaii and of course I think all three of us
00:23:25.66 --> 00:23:32.94 were in different companies so we never saw each other once we got to Hawaii but you like you fly in
00:23:32.94 --> 00:23:37.50 and you get there and it's like oh my gosh we're in Hawaii and we get on the bus we get all
00:23:37.50 --> 00:23:43.02 our gear and we get dropped off at the battalion office and we got you know two of my seniors waiting
00:23:43.02 --> 00:23:48.22 on me and he's like they're basically like pull me to the bear it's just so it's like you're all
00:23:48.22 --> 00:23:54.14 ours now it's like oh gosh and then you know you start hearing stories from like other the the other
00:23:54.14 --> 00:24:00.94 guys that you know got there with me and how they're their seniors are you know welcoming them into
00:24:00.94 --> 00:24:11.34 the the platoon what month did you get there March March of 2006 okay and so it seems you get there
00:24:11.34 --> 00:24:15.50 so and those guys were just coming back from Afghanistan right they were they they were actually
00:24:15.50 --> 00:24:21.02 over there they're in Operation Red Wing and yeah they were I think they got back February of 2006
00:24:21.02 --> 00:24:29.26 so they were just getting back from there post deployment leave and you know once once we got there
00:24:29.26 --> 00:24:35.10 it was pretty much you got to get right into another workup and and then that workup is where you
00:24:35.10 --> 00:24:41.10 really start integrating everyone together or working in platoon size elements working in company
00:24:41.10 --> 00:24:45.58 size elements it was and then that's when we kind of they told us when we first got there everything
00:24:45.58 --> 00:24:50.30 you learned in school of infantry just like lose it because now you're gonna learn what we teach you
00:24:50.30 --> 00:24:55.74 and you know from everything from just like clearing conference rooms and barracks rooms to
00:24:55.74 --> 00:25:00.38 you know working on patrolling up the streets in Hawaii and that was the one bad thing about
00:25:00.38 --> 00:25:04.14 being stationed in Hawaii that's it's a great place to be stationed but there wasn't much to do
00:25:04.14 --> 00:25:09.42 any training and we would I mean we would literally patrol them down the streets at K-bay
00:25:09.42 --> 00:25:14.22 Kanye O'Bay Hawaii and they had a couple old barracks that we'd work mounts you know we do
00:25:14.22 --> 00:25:19.82 mount training with and with simmerounds and you know we do we do what it bellows which was like
00:25:19.82 --> 00:25:24.30 a little air force base that they were starting to create like a mount town and that's when we
00:25:24.30 --> 00:25:29.10 did a lot of our training and kind of our field work and now at this point are you starting to think
00:25:29.10 --> 00:25:34.30 and you got guys that are just coming back from Afghanistan are you starting to think like okay
00:25:34.30 --> 00:25:37.74 now I really need to start paying attention the reason I'm asking you these questions is because
00:25:37.74 --> 00:25:44.14 I'm trying to relate you know when I joined the navy it was 1990 there was like I guess the
00:25:44.14 --> 00:25:48.38 Gulf War was kind of on the horizon but and it was gone so quick that by the time I was in
00:25:48.38 --> 00:25:54.06 Buds it was over and so even when I was doing workups and stuff like I would always be thinking
00:25:55.98 --> 00:26:03.26 like okay I need to be good at this because someday I might need this skill but that's a big
00:26:03.26 --> 00:26:08.54 stretch you know what I mean whereas once September 11th happened every one of these young guys
00:26:08.54 --> 00:26:13.18 it was coming in it was like oh I'm probably it wasn't like someday I might need this skill
00:26:13.18 --> 00:26:18.22 was like I'm probably gonna need this skill in the next couple months to save my life or my friends
00:26:18.22 --> 00:26:23.74 lives did you feel like that kind of intensity from yourself and from the other guys that were
00:26:23.74 --> 00:26:28.86 just coming back from overseas? I think so because I feel like the way they were kind of instructing
00:26:28.86 --> 00:26:34.22 us and teaching us this stuff and they kept relaying that any minute now that we could be called
00:26:34.22 --> 00:26:39.66 up and deploy and you start getting more serious about it and I think my attitude changed and it
00:26:39.66 --> 00:26:45.34 wasn't more of like joking around even though I liked to joke a lot but it was when it's time to
00:26:45.34 --> 00:26:50.14 be serious it's time to be serious and it's time to learn you know and you know whatever weapons
00:26:50.14 --> 00:26:56.62 I was carrying around if it's a saw or the the the the rifle the M16 you need to learn everything
00:26:56.62 --> 00:27:00.78 about that and you need to learn it to its tea and I think that's the one thing that I really
00:27:00.78 --> 00:27:06.94 made more attention about and and it's but it was just like you could fill it from your seniors
00:27:06.94 --> 00:27:11.58 because they they experienced like casually they experienced death over in Afghanistan they knew
00:27:11.58 --> 00:27:16.06 what combat was like and you started understanding that this is serious now this thing you know
00:27:16.06 --> 00:27:20.06 the same video game or a joke you're getting ready to go to war and you know five six seven
00:27:20.06 --> 00:27:25.74 months or even tomorrow you never know and so everything that you need to learn here is something
00:27:25.74 --> 00:27:29.82 that you need to take serious because this is you could be had yourself in this situation when
00:27:29.82 --> 00:27:34.78 you're in combat and what point did you know where you would deploy to that you would deploy to
00:27:34.78 --> 00:27:42.70 Iraq I feel like it was aftercax and July we were in we were in cax from June to July of 2006
00:27:42.70 --> 00:27:47.42 which is great months to be in the deserts in California but I feel like once we got back there
00:27:47.42 --> 00:27:51.74 it was pretty much like we're going to Iraq and and that was so we're still in is this is
00:27:51.74 --> 00:27:58.54 oh five or six oh six okay got it yeah join join September 2005 and on on it was on a plane
00:27:58.54 --> 00:28:03.34 in September 2006 had a tour of Iraq so that's one of the things I want to do in the Marine Corps as
00:28:03.34 --> 00:28:07.82 mentioned it was just I wanted to deploy and I was literally in the Marine Corps a year and I was
00:28:07.82 --> 00:28:12.86 already on a plane headed overseas and then did what point did you know where where and Iraq you
00:28:12.86 --> 00:28:17.10 were going that you were heading up to a ditha I think we we knew we were going to the Alambar
00:28:17.10 --> 00:28:22.54 and north of western part of Iraq but we were never told what city I think once we got to Alessad
00:28:22.54 --> 00:28:26.70 and we were starting to relieve three three and hear about like what they went through and where they
00:28:26.70 --> 00:28:31.66 were at is when we started really realising okay this is where we're going so was when you actually
00:28:31.66 --> 00:28:37.18 got to you got in countries when you realised okay we're going to hath ditha you knew that you were
00:28:37.18 --> 00:28:43.02 going to relieve three three you probably heard a bunch of the stories and I mean so this is so I was
00:28:43.02 --> 00:28:50.22 in I was in Ramadi at this time you know from the spring of oh six until the fall of oh six
00:28:50.22 --> 00:28:57.18 so we overlapped probably by about a month maybe a little bit more of when you arrived in Iraq
00:28:57.18 --> 00:29:02.06 and you flew down Alessad you said flew down Alessad and we were there basically a day and then
00:29:02.06 --> 00:29:07.90 while we were in Alessad three three was starting to pull some of their marines out and that's when
00:29:07.90 --> 00:29:12.22 we started interacting with them and they told us that they felt bad from what we were getting
00:29:12.22 --> 00:29:17.50 ready to get involved they lost so many marines while they were over there and and then it's just kind
00:29:17.50 --> 00:29:23.90 of like you hear stories of other guys in our company like basically in a firefight just to get on
00:29:23.90 --> 00:29:31.02 their fob and you know once we left Alessad we took we flew up to the hath ditha dam and mill the night
00:29:31.74 --> 00:29:36.30 say they're overnight we started loading our mags and we got in a big convoy and we drove into a
00:29:36.30 --> 00:29:43.18 hath ditha and it was I mean you just like you hear the stories of hath ditha from three three and then
00:29:43.18 --> 00:29:51.66 when three one went through there stint before and and it's just while while west and again you
00:29:51.66 --> 00:29:56.54 only see it on TV you never expect to be walking the same streets and you know this stuff going on
00:29:56.54 --> 00:30:02.22 but you know the first time we went out on patrol it was it was nerve wracking it was like it's
00:30:02.22 --> 00:30:06.38 like you do this in training so much and you feel like you do it so well but now that you're in
00:30:06.38 --> 00:30:10.06 a situation where it's like oh gosh you know I got to look here I got to look here I got to look
00:30:10.06 --> 00:30:14.94 up I got to look down and what was your position in the platoon that was a point man oh get some
00:30:14.94 --> 00:30:23.02 so it has a it was fun you know as I think after the first firefight is when like you kind of like
00:30:23.02 --> 00:30:27.82 okay I could do this this is good I'm motivated now you know and and I was that guy remember one
00:30:27.82 --> 00:30:33.26 one time we got a firefight and before we went on patrol I was like gosh I'm ready to get some
00:30:33.26 --> 00:30:37.58 I'm ready to get a firefight you know and and I didn't know my squally to heard this but after we
00:30:37.58 --> 00:30:42.46 got in like a two or three hour long firefight we're walking back on to the fob and he yells at me
00:30:42.46 --> 00:30:46.70 Bradford I'm like what he's like I want to kill you like what did I do now you know that's like
00:30:46.70 --> 00:30:51.50 like we all come back alive you know like that was a good thing but it was you know it's it's
00:30:51.50 --> 00:30:55.90 funny the first firefight we got into we were in the palm grows and we were walking along this
00:30:55.90 --> 00:31:01.34 compound wall and these these you know little trees they're they're no bigger than there are
00:31:01.34 --> 00:31:06.54 no water than a salt ball and then there was one no water than a baseball and they opened up
00:31:06.54 --> 00:31:12.70 from our left and so me and my team leader jep behind the one that's the size of a salt ball
00:31:12.94 --> 00:31:17.02 and he's like hey Bradford get over there but I'm actually not like bull crap that one's smaller
00:31:17.02 --> 00:31:22.22 than this one you know and and then our corpsman who was a he was a is a junior corpsman
00:31:22.22 --> 00:31:28.14 he had the shotgun for breaching and he laid off around and I don't I'm pretty sure he didn't hit
00:31:28.14 --> 00:31:33.74 the guy but the boom scared him and he took off and but it was just an of course the same day
00:31:33.74 --> 00:31:40.30 in the Marine Corps it's just our comms went out and so the stuff that we got was kind of crap
00:31:40.30 --> 00:31:44.22 so it's like here we are in the middle of the palm grows that they're a firefight and we don't
00:31:44.22 --> 00:31:49.34 have no comms were shooting up smoke and trying to get somebody to come down there and help us you know
00:31:49.34 --> 00:31:55.10 and so what was where were you guys living in Heditha there was a fob in the middle of town that
00:31:55.10 --> 00:32:00.14 we were that we stayed at that was our home that was right in the wrecky's houses and
00:32:00.14 --> 00:32:04.70 was it a was it a platoon size element in there a company size element in there it was a company
00:32:04.70 --> 00:32:09.50 the way that our battalion was split up the battalion commander and the headquarters was more in the
00:32:09.50 --> 00:32:15.18 dam Heditha dam and then Heditha was the the main AO because there's a larger city and that's where
00:32:15.18 --> 00:32:21.50 our company was echo company and we had we had golf company to the south of us in Hachlene and then
00:32:21.50 --> 00:32:28.06 across the river in barwana was fox company and and weapons company would basically go from from from
00:32:28.06 --> 00:32:34.06 AO to AO and about three months into the deployment our battalion commander and the headquarters
00:32:34.06 --> 00:32:39.50 detachment would come and they actually set up shop in Heditha with us once they were a raki
00:32:39.50 --> 00:32:48.14 police or raki army left our fob and you know we had we yeah there was it was a company element
00:32:48.14 --> 00:32:53.34 and we pretty much ran you know with a fourth platoon would work more with the raki police
00:32:53.34 --> 00:32:58.06 raki army and then the one platoon was basically set up for mobile and the other platoons would
00:32:58.06 --> 00:33:03.18 rotate back and forth between posts and patrol so it was I forgot how many days on we would be off
00:33:03.18 --> 00:33:08.62 on post duty and then you just kind of rotate back and forth and when we were in Heditha our mobile
00:33:08.62 --> 00:33:15.58 unit got hit so hard that they had to change out and another platoon had to take over just because of the
00:33:15.58 --> 00:33:22.06 snipers the indirects IDs just we lost so many guys and throughout that whole deployment the whole
00:33:22.06 --> 00:33:28.94 battalion lost 23 Marines and I think echo company lost nine Marines and um a majority I think
00:33:30.70 --> 00:33:35.26 I think of all of them were within the first two or three months not to mention the purple heart
00:33:35.26 --> 00:33:40.38 recipients that we got from that deployment and when you were were you guys doing most of you guys
00:33:40.38 --> 00:33:45.26 were doing almost all foot patrol out of the fob I was we were foot patrol every patrol and I actually
00:33:45.26 --> 00:33:50.54 felt safer walk in the streets and I did in the vehicle and I mean we'd get in the back of a
00:33:50.54 --> 00:33:55.82 seven ton and they're launching grenades for the seven ton trying to blow us up and you know the
00:33:55.82 --> 00:34:01.58 one ton that we were in a patrol with the Iraqi army we were in the old old green homies with a no up
00:34:01.58 --> 00:34:06.46 armor and me and my friend was setting the back seat was like good luck I love you brother because
00:34:06.46 --> 00:34:12.62 because if this something happens right now then we're screwed yeah the old homies aren't going to
00:34:12.62 --> 00:34:21.02 take up idea hit very well no not at all and it was like I I loved being over there you know we
00:34:21.02 --> 00:34:26.22 talking about serving this country and you know the one time that we're in our rack it's like
00:34:26.22 --> 00:34:30.62 we had one big screen TV in our childhood we were never in a childhood we lived in an Iraqi house and
00:34:30.62 --> 00:34:36.30 it was just our platoon and you you're away from the news you're away from society everything going
00:34:36.30 --> 00:34:41.10 on it was just you and your brothers and that's one thing like today I miss more than anything
00:34:41.10 --> 00:34:47.18 it's just being around those guys and you you see them open up and you know when you're when
00:34:47.18 --> 00:34:53.34 you're marine brother you know gets killed or wounded like you see the motion that it's like you're
00:34:53.34 --> 00:34:58.86 there for him you know and he comes to you and those are the things that I miss more about the
00:34:58.86 --> 00:35:03.74 Marine Corps and unfortunately living in Kentucky today it's like you're not around the Marine Corps
00:35:03.74 --> 00:35:09.82 base and you're you know I get to see my friends I don't know once a year it seems like and a lot
00:35:09.82 --> 00:35:16.62 of the guys in my platoon I haven't even seen since my injury the what how long would you guys
00:35:16.62 --> 00:35:20.70 go out patrol for like what would you guys patrol for a couple hours would you guys find an
00:35:20.70 --> 00:35:25.50 objective and then head that way and then check it out and then come back did you have an objective
00:35:25.50 --> 00:35:30.54 we just do in presence patrols what was that all about we were doing a lot of meet and greets present
00:35:30.54 --> 00:35:36.54 patrols ID patrols we'd go out for two or three hours sometimes we'd actually go out and set up
00:35:36.54 --> 00:35:40.94 patrol base in the middle town and just stay there for a couple nights and run patrols out of the
00:35:40.94 --> 00:35:48.54 patrol base later on an appointment our our comedy commander kind of made it an objective to set up
00:35:48.54 --> 00:35:52.62 patrol bases throughout the town we had one in north of the ditha one in south and then one out and kind
00:35:52.62 --> 00:35:59.90 of the I guess I'd be the the western part of the ditha and which we'd basically we'd have engineers
00:35:59.90 --> 00:36:05.50 come in and they'd build like little little fobs of these houses and actually spent Christmas of
00:36:05.50 --> 00:36:10.38 2006 on that patrol base up in north of ditha and it was sitting there on the roof in the middle
00:36:10.38 --> 00:36:16.62 of the night in cold turkey and haem you know and very Christmas bro yeah and it's so fun
00:36:16.62 --> 00:36:21.58 because it's like they told us it's like oh you're going to have Christmas off yeah that didn't last
00:36:21.58 --> 00:36:27.18 very long because here we are on patrol going up to north of ditha but it was it was fun I enjoyed it
00:36:27.18 --> 00:36:32.78 you know one of the some of the cool things that we did there we were we had a they believe there
00:36:32.78 --> 00:36:37.42 was a cache and one of the islands and there was no bridge nothing to get to the island and the
00:36:37.42 --> 00:36:42.54 only way to get there was to take river rafts and I'm not gonna lie that was the one time I
00:36:42.54 --> 00:36:47.42 felt like I was a navy seal going down to your fridge river on a river raft then but it was in the
00:36:47.42 --> 00:36:51.42 middle of the night and they had a two-fourty on the front of it and they would you know pick us up
00:36:51.42 --> 00:36:58.38 from the bridge and we would ride up right to the the the island and we actually dug in
00:36:58.38 --> 00:37:07.02 and stayed there overnight and and I believe that was Thanksgiving 2006 so I was happy holiday
00:37:07.02 --> 00:37:10.46 you know so like looking back now on the holidays on Thanksgiving and Christmas it's like I just
00:37:10.46 --> 00:37:15.90 look back on those two moments of my life it's like sleeping on a cold island because people
00:37:15.90 --> 00:37:19.74 look at our rack and think it's warm all the time but it's pretty cold over there in the winter
00:37:19.74 --> 00:37:25.10 months and and then of course Christmas times it on a roof and how often were you guys getting
00:37:25.10 --> 00:37:30.06 in direct fire into your into your fob with any you guys with mortars all out we got mortar
00:37:30.06 --> 00:37:36.14 at about every every day about five o'clock you know chal time and one of the times like we had a
00:37:36.14 --> 00:37:40.30 I don't know it was like a hill there's like a big sand hill in the middle of our fob we had a couple
00:37:40.30 --> 00:37:45.34 post up on top of it and I was actually we were on post duty and there was like Bradford
00:37:45.34 --> 00:37:49.58 once you bring these batteries up to post five which is at the end of it and so I take a battery
00:37:49.58 --> 00:37:55.26 to and I'm walking down and like going down this is very steep and while I'm halfway down they start
00:37:55.26 --> 00:37:59.58 dropping orders on us and it's like I'm thinking to myself it's like should I go back to the post or
00:37:59.58 --> 00:38:03.58 should I ruin and like I take all sprinting down the hill thankfully I didn't like roll all
00:38:03.58 --> 00:38:07.98 way down and my team leader like when I run in there there's like where's Bradford and I'm like
00:38:07.98 --> 00:38:12.46 sitting there like gasping for air if I just like sprinted across the you know down as big hill
00:38:13.18 --> 00:38:18.38 but you know we got we got mortar about every afternoon and and thankfully they
00:38:18.38 --> 00:38:26.14 they're more sought because they missed and one of the times we were actually very lucky we were
00:38:26.14 --> 00:38:32.78 in our fob we were in our house and we were all kicked back on our bunk beds and my my really
00:38:32.78 --> 00:38:37.74 good friend my best friend actually was working on the hot air tank or whatever it was outside
00:38:37.74 --> 00:38:43.50 and they dropped the mortar like 30 feet behind our house and when that thing hit we just
00:38:43.50 --> 00:38:47.10 automatically went to our gear because it sounded like it went right through the middle of our house
00:38:47.10 --> 00:38:53.02 and he'd up taking trap no one to lick and thankfully that was it and that's when I realized that
00:38:53.66 --> 00:38:57.98 you know I had to have many friends got killed when I was over there but I wasn't you know right there
00:38:57.98 --> 00:39:03.34 listening to him scream as they put a turnic at on and that's when I realized that this is real you know
00:39:03.34 --> 00:39:09.90 and not only it's like this guy is like fighting to put a turnic at on and and he's my best
00:39:09.90 --> 00:39:15.74 friend he was my roommate when I was in in our Hawaii and it really killed me thankfully that
00:39:15.74 --> 00:39:19.66 he didn't lose a leg he'd come back in a couple weeks and he was sitting there showing us pieces
00:39:19.66 --> 00:39:23.42 of the shrapnel until I said he went down to Alisson has some ice cream and it's like
00:39:24.46 --> 00:39:29.90 yeah you know forget the way I felt about it you know but but it's you know a lot of
00:39:29.90 --> 00:39:36.86 scary moments bring together the the true brothers you know and the fellowship and then how long
00:39:36.86 --> 00:39:46.22 it was it was a January is when you got injured. January 18th 2007 and then we were you know
00:39:46.22 --> 00:39:51.02 four months into a deployment we started kind of you know you could start here in a little
00:39:51.02 --> 00:39:56.06 scottle butt about the ad von coming in you know we're getting ready to start heading out you know
00:39:56.06 --> 00:40:01.90 that the other units coming in and I actually was speaking to my uncle on the phone that day you know
00:40:01.90 --> 00:40:05.66 we rarely got to call home and I was selling I was like you know the deployment's going well
00:40:05.66 --> 00:40:11.58 you know they're starting to talk about the other guys coming in you know and and hung up the
00:40:11.58 --> 00:40:17.58 phone because we had to go to a brief and the brief was the patrol and you know unfortunately I
00:40:17.58 --> 00:40:21.02 don't remember yet this part right here I remember all the way up to like the last minute walking
00:40:21.02 --> 00:40:26.86 down the street and as I was walking point I look out in front of me you know we're walking along
00:40:26.86 --> 00:40:31.82 a road alongside the parallel or you Freddie's River is called part place and we were coming
00:40:31.82 --> 00:40:36.46 up past his compound wall into this opening with a bunch of palm trees and I see a white bag
00:40:36.46 --> 00:40:41.98 leaned up against the palm tree about 30 yards off to my right and as I you know like look like
00:40:41.98 --> 00:40:46.62 that's a suspicious item and I turn around till my team leader to my left he was on the other
00:40:46.62 --> 00:40:50.54 side of the road and I turn around till everybody behind me and the minute I turned back around
00:40:50.54 --> 00:40:54.70 and I looked down and there was a stitched at random perpendicular to the road and I see the
00:40:54.70 --> 00:40:59.34 wires going inside the pipe underneath the road and I was standing right on top of the pipe and
00:40:59.34 --> 00:41:04.22 I mean in a matter of seconds it exploded and sent a shirt and all both moths and that was the last
00:41:04.22 --> 00:41:11.42 thing I ever saw was that white bag and those wires and you know is this is laying there conscious
00:41:11.42 --> 00:41:17.66 like hearing everything going on around me I squall leader calling and QRF and you know just
00:41:17.66 --> 00:41:22.94 and I actually had the the litter kit in my pack so it's like they had to figure that out and then
00:41:22.94 --> 00:41:27.74 the whole time I was trying to stand up you know I had my left leg was it was blown off
00:41:27.74 --> 00:41:33.74 like I didn't have a left leg my right leg was severely damaged and um but it just felt like
00:41:33.74 --> 00:41:38.38 people always asked me like what were you feeling when this was all going on and it went so quick
00:41:38.38 --> 00:41:43.50 that I don't even think I had a chance to feel anything like I literally went from like walking
00:41:43.50 --> 00:41:49.10 down the patrol seeing something suspicious to laying on the ground looking in darkness and I didn't
00:41:49.10 --> 00:41:54.62 know if that was it if I didn't know if I was dead and you know it's just hearing voices around me
00:41:54.62 --> 00:42:00.22 they put me in the kit and they take me into a compound and you know as we're waiting on QRF to get
00:42:00.22 --> 00:42:05.18 there you know my buddies look there's something they're holding my hand talking to me because
00:42:05.18 --> 00:42:11.34 you know out of our squad we probably got into the most far right set of our whole company
00:42:11.34 --> 00:42:16.30 but as we left the fog with full marines we'd always come back with full marines we let the
00:42:16.30 --> 00:42:19.90 enemy know that if you're going to mess with us we're going to give you everything we got more
00:42:19.90 --> 00:42:27.74 and this is the first time that we suffered any kind of casualty and laying there basically fighting
00:42:27.74 --> 00:42:32.78 for my life and they're holding my hands talking to me if they didn't think I would make it out of there
00:42:33.42 --> 00:42:39.26 and as QRF shows up they put me in the back of a home v and the last voice I heard was
00:42:39.82 --> 00:42:43.90 as I mentioned earlier the small marine corps was from my senior drill instructor
00:42:43.90 --> 00:42:49.42 who was a ptoon sergeant in the same company said brafford you'll be fine and then I passed out
00:42:49.42 --> 00:42:55.10 I didn't know if that was it I didn't know if I was truly dead now and I was the end I felt like
00:42:55.10 --> 00:42:59.74 I was only 20 years old in I felt like that was the end of my life and those are the last words I heard
00:43:00.62 --> 00:43:07.98 and you know I woke up three weeks later from a coma you know and this is when I realized that
00:43:07.98 --> 00:43:15.58 what I truly love to do that my true purpose in life was to serve this country wearing the uniform
00:43:16.46 --> 00:43:20.94 and it was taken from me like here I am in the United States while my brothers are wearing
00:43:20.94 --> 00:43:26.22 Iraq fighting right now I felt like a coward like they would try to they would call me when they
00:43:26.22 --> 00:43:30.30 could and I wouldn't want to talk to him on the phone like I would always tell him with some kind of
00:43:30.30 --> 00:43:33.98 excuse that I'm sleeping or I'm doing something just so I didn't have to talk to him because I
00:43:33.98 --> 00:43:42.14 felt like I let him down and that it killed me and then once once my dad told me that I lost my legs
00:43:42.46 --> 00:43:49.18 that was the worst thing in the world then I just wanted to die I like the guilt the depression
00:43:49.90 --> 00:43:56.38 I didn't want to live a life anymore and I always always told him like when he told me that I was
00:43:56.38 --> 00:44:01.02 like I felt like my legs were like a lizard's tail you know it's like they're grow back like you
00:44:01.02 --> 00:44:06.30 see it on the news all the time what you've never expected to happen to yourself and here I am I didn't
00:44:06.30 --> 00:44:12.86 care nothing about the vision I just wanted my legs back because it was it was tough those first two or
00:44:12.86 --> 00:44:17.98 three weeks after I get out of ICU like I wouldn't eat nothing I was so skinny I could barely
00:44:17.98 --> 00:44:22.46 lift my head up off the bed and the hospital banned that they gave me would go all the way up to my
00:44:22.46 --> 00:44:28.14 my bicep pretty much because I just wouldn't want to eat I wanted to die like the nurses hated
00:44:28.14 --> 00:44:33.82 me like one of the nurses coming like two in the morning I finally got some sleep and she kept
00:44:33.82 --> 00:44:41.42 poking me around with the needle and I literally called her a stupid idiot and like and she wasn't
00:44:41.42 --> 00:44:50.14 my nurse no more in and I felt so bad but you know it just I felt like my whole life was taken
00:44:50.14 --> 00:44:55.82 from me just from stepping in that bomb you know I knew what could happen to me and my whole
00:44:55.82 --> 00:45:00.06 point of being deployed of us I'm either going to come home my brothers I'm coming home in the body back
00:45:00.06 --> 00:45:09.10 there's no in the middle and and here I am now down this whole dark path this new road you know
00:45:09.10 --> 00:45:14.14 as a 20 year old how in the world am I going to live my life now like I got I don't even know
00:45:14.14 --> 00:45:20.14 what a blind guy no legs can do I what point did you realize that you weren't going to be able to see
00:45:20.14 --> 00:45:26.86 anymore it was pretty much more sick and I believe was my last surgery that they tried to kind of like
00:45:27.58 --> 00:45:32.62 give me some vision back and nothing come back from that and you know about time more
00:45:32.62 --> 00:45:37.26 sick and got there I was still positive not beating I was moving around a lot more starting to gain weight
00:45:38.06 --> 00:45:44.86 and but you know it's they they told me that they can do the surgery but then they also told
00:45:44.86 --> 00:45:50.46 me that it's it's not a you know a half percentage that you're going to get vision back at all you know
00:45:50.46 --> 00:45:57.66 and they started kind of like talking about you know it's live in life visually impaired and
00:45:58.62 --> 00:46:05.26 but it was it was tough it was it wasn't you know and to me the the vision didn't bother me much
00:46:05.26 --> 00:46:11.90 at all it was losing my legs and you know the Marine Corps you know it's the joining the Marine
00:46:11.90 --> 00:46:17.58 Corps in 2004 was the greatest decision in my life for the reasons like this right now because it was
00:46:17.58 --> 00:46:23.98 the Marine Corps that was there each and every day in my hospital room talking to me and helping
00:46:23.98 --> 00:46:28.70 me understand that this road that I'm getting ready to go down you know that there is a light at the
00:46:28.70 --> 00:46:34.06 end of the tunnel and not only talking about my deployment or talking about the Marine Corps but just
00:46:34.06 --> 00:46:40.70 talking about life and coming in there joking around with me and because you know looking back on
00:46:40.70 --> 00:46:48.06 it now like I'm truly fortunate and blessed to be here today because the amount of blood I lost was
00:46:48.06 --> 00:46:53.66 a body's worth of blood my left leg was taken from me I have a piece of my small intestines taken out
00:46:54.22 --> 00:47:00.54 you know shred no winter both my eyes and and you know it's just it's truly a blessing
00:47:02.30 --> 00:47:09.18 now that's obviously a big transition of calling it a blessing and calling you're where you're
00:47:09.18 --> 00:47:16.14 right right now a blessing from when you first you know realize your situation and you're saying hey
00:47:16.14 --> 00:47:23.26 you wanted to die I mean that's I mean that's as bad as it gets what do you think it was
00:47:24.06 --> 00:47:30.46 that made you start to realize you know what all right here's my new situation and I'm gonna
00:47:30.46 --> 00:47:36.38 I'm gonna get after it the Marines that would come in a visit me they kept reenouriting that
00:47:36.38 --> 00:47:41.58 I was a Marine the nurses the corpsmen even though I would fight it they never gave up on me and they
00:47:41.58 --> 00:47:47.34 still pushed and challenged me and I think that was the one thing that made me realize that
00:47:48.22 --> 00:47:53.10 this is just a new challenge for me you know the one thing in the Marine Corps is to adapt
00:47:53.10 --> 00:47:58.38 to no overcome I'm gonna have to learn to adapt to these injuries and overcome it and um that's
00:47:58.38 --> 00:48:01.66 one thing that helped me realize that there's life outside of the hospital doors because at that time
00:48:01.66 --> 00:48:05.74 when I was going through the pressure and guilt there was two roads I could have went down you know
00:48:05.74 --> 00:48:11.34 the self-pity the drugs alcoholism suicide but I don't want to go down that road I didn't want
00:48:11.34 --> 00:48:15.82 to be another statistic I want to go down the road of happiness and living my life to the fullest
00:48:15.82 --> 00:48:20.38 and proving people wrong people tell me I can't do something that I'm gonna go out and do it
00:48:20.38 --> 00:48:25.98 I want to be that blind guy with no no legs proving people wrong you know and and that's why
00:48:25.98 --> 00:48:30.62 I always told people when I first got hurt I was like anything you can do I can do I might do it
00:48:30.62 --> 00:48:35.58 differently but it's gonna get done and during that time with that Marine coming in that hospital
00:48:35.58 --> 00:48:41.74 room this is when I realized in my mind that this is what I want to do I want to put myself in
00:48:41.74 --> 00:48:46.46 his position I want to help out others fairly wounded warriors Marines soldiers sailors airman
00:48:47.10 --> 00:48:52.06 and I began creating these goals and these you know a lot of them brought the one
00:48:52.06 --> 00:48:57.18 broad one was staying in the Marine Corps and you know but I realized that I needed these little
00:48:57.18 --> 00:49:01.10 goals first I need to learn to get out of my hospital bed I need to go from hospital bed to my
00:49:01.10 --> 00:49:07.26 wheelchair and I need to learn to eat and the once I started realizing this and I started
00:49:07.26 --> 00:49:11.90 putting my mind in the right direction then I started getting off medications I started getting off
00:49:11.90 --> 00:49:20.46 pain pills and I started getting more weight on my body and I was injured on January 18th I was
00:49:20.46 --> 00:49:25.82 in but that's on January 21st and by March 21st I was headed to my the polychromus in enrichment
00:49:25.82 --> 00:49:31.98 Virginia where I would focus more on physical therapy and occupational therapy so it's like you know
00:49:31.98 --> 00:49:38.14 I was young and I healed quicker but once I got into my mind that I could do this then I didn't
00:49:38.14 --> 00:49:43.58 need I didn't want anybody to slow me down and and you know I went through the polychromus center
00:49:43.58 --> 00:49:50.38 and I was there for two months and by June 29th 2007 I was sent up on my prostate legs for the first time
00:49:50.38 --> 00:49:59.18 and you know one of the things that I talk about what I talk to Vets is I always tell them you know
00:49:59.18 --> 00:50:05.10 people say well how do we get through this and I always say you got to find a new mission
00:50:05.66 --> 00:50:09.90 and because you know you've had this mission whatever that mission was whether whatever service
00:50:09.90 --> 00:50:14.62 branch you were in wherever you were fighting you had a mission and it makes your life very clear
00:50:14.62 --> 00:50:21.10 and simple because what you do every day is you try and accomplish the mission and when I hear
00:50:21.10 --> 00:50:28.62 you talking about that it's like it's exactly that you are in a situation you had a mission boom
00:50:28.62 --> 00:50:33.90 you get blown up now you don't have a mission anymore and now when you get you wake up in Bethesda
00:50:33.90 --> 00:50:39.98 you're you're in this situation you go I don't I don't I'm depressed I don't want to live anymore
00:50:39.98 --> 00:50:48.06 and then someone comes in and says hey you could help and then all of a sudden boom you have a
00:50:48.06 --> 00:50:53.74 new mission and as soon as you get that new mission you go yes I can oh and by the way you you don't
00:50:53.74 --> 00:50:57.50 think I'm going to be able to walk you don't think I'm going to be able to defend for myself watch this
00:50:58.86 --> 00:51:04.06 that's it and you know like looking back and out January 18th 2007 I felt like that was the day that
00:51:04.06 --> 00:51:09.50 the Lord above looked down on me he didn't want me to he didn't want me to go to heaven yet
00:51:09.98 --> 00:51:15.66 and he gave me he put me on a new patrol in life as you mentioned mission and that was to share my
00:51:15.66 --> 00:51:22.06 story and inspire it others by living my life to the fullest and beyond my own bare minimal and I
00:51:22.06 --> 00:51:29.26 feel like that I feel like that was my new mission in life that you know we're all brought on this
00:51:29.26 --> 00:51:35.58 earth to serve in some kind of purpose serve some mission and you know sharing my story and going
00:51:35.58 --> 00:51:40.86 out doing things that I'm doing today is inspiring and motivating others not those who were injured
00:51:40.86 --> 00:51:50.14 in combat but people who are living you know a civilian life today and it truly inspires and motivates
00:51:50.14 --> 00:51:54.94 me to continue doing what I'm doing because I know that I'm inspiring somebody along the way and always
00:51:54.94 --> 00:51:59.66 tell people if I could do inspire and motivate one person a day then that's a job I'll done for me
00:51:59.66 --> 00:52:07.26 and that's what I'm left on this earth to do and I love it you know it's just this is what I've been
00:52:07.26 --> 00:52:13.26 given and I might as well accept it and move on you know improvise something that we're always
00:52:13.26 --> 00:52:18.14 learning the Marine Corps and you know when I when I do speak in engagements I focus on a lot of
00:52:18.14 --> 00:52:23.50 things in the Marine Corps that I learned like a depth and overcome and you know the next one is
00:52:23.50 --> 00:52:29.18 lead by example which you know a lot about I'm sure and then the next one's never quit and
00:52:29.18 --> 00:52:34.46 through it all through those three attitude is everything if you walk into any situation with
00:52:34.46 --> 00:52:39.50 the positive attitude that's the first step to success if you think about something negatively
00:52:39.50 --> 00:52:45.26 then you're never going to accomplish anything so when I was laying in that hospital bed there
00:52:45.26 --> 00:52:50.94 was no negative thoughts you know and I had guys one of the Marines who were actually it was wounded
00:52:50.94 --> 00:52:57.02 two months before me lost the leg in Haditha would come in day and night and he would also kind
00:52:57.02 --> 00:53:00.30 of tell me it's like all right this is what's going to go on you know you're going to get a prosthetic
00:53:00.30 --> 00:53:06.54 it's going to be alone you know it's the rehabs and tents but this is it you know but put one foot
00:53:06.54 --> 00:53:10.86 in front of the next and that's what I kept living life with and when I was trying to learn how to walk
00:53:10.86 --> 00:53:17.34 in 2007 I was as a double on PT tend to scissor walk one foot in front of the next and you're
00:53:17.34 --> 00:53:22.78 pretty much trip over yourself and you look like an idiot but with vision I was going from the right
00:53:22.78 --> 00:53:27.82 wall to the left wall and my physical therapist stop means like Matt just stopped just just walk
00:53:28.22 --> 00:53:33.98 put one foot in front of the next and I look back on that now and that's how we live each and
00:53:33.98 --> 00:53:38.86 every day it's like we never know what tomorrow is going to hold or next week we just got to worry
00:53:38.86 --> 00:53:43.58 about right now on the present and that's how I live my life right now and I never know what that
00:53:43.58 --> 00:53:48.70 next step is going to be but I'm going to take that step forward you know and you know I might walk
00:53:48.70 --> 00:53:53.42 around with two prosthetic legs and look darkness in the you know the face every day but
00:53:53.42 --> 00:54:00.14 tell you one thing my my toes are pointed forward and my vision on life is 2020 and that's what
00:54:00.14 --> 00:54:06.30 I tell people today and it's I love it I love it and it's you know it's the adrenaline the motivation
00:54:06.86 --> 00:54:11.82 to do things when you can't see and it hurts when you run into things too so
00:54:11.82 --> 00:54:19.90 so the attitude of just walk that's that's a that's a beautiful attitude to have just walk
00:54:19.90 --> 00:54:27.74 quit quit all this other stuff just get up walk how hard was the transition from the bed to the
00:54:27.74 --> 00:54:35.82 wheelchair to the to the prosthetics to walk and to move on the prosthetics it really I think
00:54:35.82 --> 00:54:41.26 getting used to the prosthetics was you know basically getting my legs used to wear and prosthetics
00:54:41.26 --> 00:54:47.34 and that that was the hardest thing because like I would go to therapy every day and I would put
00:54:47.34 --> 00:54:51.34 a mind and I'd walk around and therapy but they not go right back to the wheelchair and I'm
00:54:51.34 --> 00:54:56.86 really never never wore them more than you know a couple hours a day just because I had this woman
00:54:56.86 --> 00:55:02.30 therapy until I went to the the blind school in Chicago and this gave me the opportunity where I had
00:55:02.30 --> 00:55:07.18 no chance to go back to my room and take them off so I had to wear them from seven in the morning to
00:55:07.18 --> 00:55:12.94 five at night and that's helped me strengthen up my legs and the cows is on my legs get used to
00:55:12.94 --> 00:55:18.70 wearing prosthetics and once I got back from the the blind school six months of the air I was
00:55:18.70 --> 00:55:26.30 pretty much on my legs from son or stasson said and and that was but you know through you know
00:55:26.30 --> 00:55:31.34 setting these goals early on in my rehab like you know reenless in the Marine Corps was the one
00:55:31.34 --> 00:55:36.62 thing that I wanted to do and so learning how to walk I focused on that more than my
00:55:36.62 --> 00:55:44.06 my blindness because I knew learning learning life you know in the dark would be a lot easier
00:55:44.06 --> 00:55:49.34 with legs and that helped out so much because I tried to maneuver around in a wheelchair being
00:55:49.34 --> 00:55:54.06 blind and a long cane and all this stuff and I just kept running more things but once I got
00:55:54.06 --> 00:56:00.22 on my legs and I started using a long cane and started walking around and you know it really helped
00:56:00.22 --> 00:56:06.46 that a lot so like that's like the ultimate form of prioritizing execute like yeah you know what okay
00:56:06.46 --> 00:56:11.50 I can't see but I can't walk the number one thing I'm gonna do so I'm exactly and that's what you did
00:56:11.50 --> 00:56:15.90 and that's what they like you know it's you said get from the hospital bed of the wheelchair to the
00:56:15.90 --> 00:56:20.94 prosthetics and then go to the blind school knock that out and once I'm at the blind school I'm
00:56:20.94 --> 00:56:25.50 learning everything from computer to independent living and that's a six-month school go to the blind
00:56:25.50 --> 00:56:31.98 school the the first program is six months and that's basically learning to live being visually impaired
00:56:31.98 --> 00:56:38.78 and you go back for computers and they got so many different programs now but I went there for
00:56:39.98 --> 00:56:45.58 basically from July to December just because I incorporated computers in with my program as well
00:56:46.46 --> 00:56:52.54 and a suspen from July to December and in Chicago so I experienced the cold weather there but
00:56:52.54 --> 00:57:01.42 you know it learned everything from you know checking emails to Braille to taking taking a subway
00:57:01.42 --> 00:57:06.86 and train all the way downtown Chicago and circling a block and even built a birdhouse when I was in
00:57:06.86 --> 00:57:14.94 Chicago and I don't know about you but a table saw scare me when I had visions trying to cut a piece of
00:57:14.94 --> 00:57:20.86 board with no vision that that's a little intimidating there but I didn't lose a finger thankfully
00:57:20.86 --> 00:57:26.78 so yeah you know that that's another thing that I'm here and about what you're saying it's like
00:57:27.90 --> 00:57:34.22 the way and this is something to hear all the time but the way that you're describing it is people
00:57:34.22 --> 00:57:39.26 say oh you're gonna get your big goal you know you got your big goal in the future but what you
00:57:39.26 --> 00:57:43.26 have to do is you have to set up these little goals along the way to get you there at that
00:57:43.26 --> 00:57:47.66 point in the right direction so your big goal is you wanted to stay in the Marine Corps be able to
00:57:47.66 --> 00:57:52.54 read less than order to be able to do that you had to be able to walk you had to be able to function
00:57:52.54 --> 00:57:57.74 and so you just had to fight through these little things every single day to make progress
00:57:57.74 --> 00:58:02.86 and it's funny because you know the way I've honestly described this before is like it's like shooting
00:58:03.58 --> 00:58:08.22 when you're looking you know you got your target that's far off in the distance 400 meters away
00:58:08.22 --> 00:58:12.30 if you stare at that thing your vision's gonna get blurry and you'll lose track of it so you have to
00:58:12.30 --> 00:58:17.34 focus on the front side you just front side focus that's what you do and that the
00:58:17.34 --> 00:58:21.74 thing in the background you know it kind of fades a little bit but you know it's there and then
00:58:21.74 --> 00:58:25.90 what happens is occasionally and so it's the same thing with your goal so you have your long-term goal
00:58:25.90 --> 00:58:30.86 but I think so far away sometimes it gets blurry and if you and so what you do is you focus on
00:58:30.86 --> 00:58:35.50 some little thing that's right in front of you that you can do and then that brings you a little
00:58:35.50 --> 00:58:40.38 bit closer to the goal but occasionally those little things that are short term you're doing them
00:58:40.38 --> 00:58:45.26 day after day after day they start to grind on you and you say you know what forget it I don't even
00:58:45.26 --> 00:58:49.66 want to do this today and that's when you have to look up once again at your long-term goal to
00:58:49.66 --> 00:58:54.30 say wait a second I'm moving in that direction I'm trying to get there but to hear you describe
00:58:54.30 --> 00:58:57.98 these little things and by the way you're throwing them out they're like it's no big deal like
00:58:57.98 --> 00:59:02.38 oh I just was I went from the bed to the wheelchair to the to the to the prosthetics then
00:59:02.38 --> 00:59:06.94 went to the blind school and the next thing you know I'm making bird cages and bird feeders
00:59:07.74 --> 00:59:14.62 and like I'm the the small effort or the small tasks that took a meant effort along the way
00:59:14.62 --> 00:59:19.50 but you know from my perspective what I see is you made each and every one of those things
00:59:19.50 --> 00:59:24.06 a mission I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that okay I can do that now cool I'm gonna do this and these are
00:59:24.06 --> 00:59:29.02 small little progressive steps but you're making them and you're making them every day every day
00:59:29.02 --> 00:59:34.30 you get up and you just walk walk forward and that's the one thing with being in the Marine Corps
00:59:34.30 --> 00:59:40.14 and that's really helped me out along this way is you know being organized and getting in that routine
00:59:40.14 --> 00:59:45.50 where you wake up each and every day it's like okay I'm gonna knock this out this is my goal for the day
00:59:46.14 --> 00:59:53.10 and you know better in myself was one of the goals because I knew that if I couldn't get nothing
00:59:53.10 --> 00:59:58.94 done in this life if I didn't better myself first and you know through the early days of my recovery
00:59:58.94 --> 01:00:04.06 getting all pain pills was one of the first things that I wanted to do as well and it's been 12
01:00:04.06 --> 01:00:10.38 years since I last take a pain pill and that's you know and so I didn't I didn't want my life to you know
01:00:10.38 --> 01:00:14.78 revert back to pain pills and just you know I feel a little bit of pain then then I'm going to
01:00:14.78 --> 01:00:22.54 go like go take a pill and you know I replace that with Stan Busy staying active going to the gym working
01:00:22.54 --> 01:00:30.78 out and and it really helped out a lot I didn't just you know if I felt like I got pain then I'm
01:00:30.78 --> 01:00:37.90 gonna go give it some pain you know and that's and it's the one thing and it's just you know
01:00:37.90 --> 01:00:42.14 through it through it all I've learned along the way is like people told me I couldn't do something
01:00:42.14 --> 01:00:46.54 or I can't do it why do you want to say in the Marine Corps you make so much more money
01:00:46.54 --> 01:00:50.30 outside the Marine Corps I'm like why didn't you want the Marine Corps from money you know and that's
01:00:50.30 --> 01:00:56.94 that I use that as motivation and it got me along this way and and you know I just I pretty much
01:00:56.94 --> 01:01:01.98 just like whatever you know you think that for yourself but I know what my mission in life is
01:01:02.38 --> 01:01:07.98 and I kept the positive attitude and people saw that and you know and once I got back from the
01:01:07.98 --> 01:01:12.22 blind school in 2009 I started getting out doing these events and the first event I actually did
01:01:12.22 --> 01:01:16.30 was something I opened my mouth up to my physical therapist and forgot all about until like
01:01:16.30 --> 01:01:22.46 two months before was the baton death march in 2009 and he walked up to me and he was like oh Matt
01:01:22.46 --> 01:01:26.78 you're gonna do the baton death march this year right you said last year I'm like oh crap and
01:01:26.78 --> 01:01:32.70 you know walked out and I did 10 miles and eight hours and that was the first like I was proud
01:01:32.70 --> 01:01:37.74 of doing 10 miles and eight hours but that was the first event first hike that I ever fell out of that
01:01:37.74 --> 01:01:42.30 I quit on so for people that don't know the baton death march is an event that they do out here
01:01:42.30 --> 01:01:47.42 and it's it's 26 miles right it is and you got to bring up you got to wear a rock
01:01:49.34 --> 01:01:56.30 some people yeah I just work him a buck but they do it well explain explain what
01:01:56.30 --> 01:02:02.54 what the baton death march is obviously it's to commemorate or to to remember the the folks that
01:02:02.54 --> 01:02:08.86 were actually on the real baton death march but what is one that they do here this year actually was
01:02:08.86 --> 01:02:15.10 their 30th annual baton memorial death march in white sands do Mexico when I did in 2009
01:02:16.06 --> 01:02:21.74 they it's a 26.2 long or mile long marathon and then they also have a 14 mile honorary
01:02:21.74 --> 01:02:28.46 and the the 26.2 miles actually up a mountain and down a mountain and it's it's intense because
01:02:28.46 --> 01:02:35.42 you're walking through the sands and a part of it is this loose sand pit and it's you know it's
01:02:35.42 --> 01:02:39.90 it's a good test especially for people with prosthetics and you know and you're kind of endurance
01:02:39.90 --> 01:02:47.02 and see how far you can go and when I signed up in 2009 I walked 10 miles out of in eight hours and I was like
01:02:47.02 --> 01:02:53.50 all right that's pretty proud you know I've got hurt two years ago but then again like I quit
01:02:53.50 --> 01:02:58.30 and then that really bugged me and I use that as motivation and it humbled me knowing that
01:02:58.86 --> 01:03:04.14 all right you know I was a good runner before I never quit on any hikes like I would always finish
01:03:04.94 --> 01:03:13.02 and then I it realized that okay I'm not who I am before so I got to learn this way now you know
01:03:13.02 --> 01:03:19.90 and not everything's as easy as it used to be but once once I finished like I told the lady I told
01:03:19.90 --> 01:03:24.30 my therapist and I was like once I'm done I'm putting my medical board and I'm going for my
01:03:24.30 --> 01:03:30.38 reinlismant package and and I was like all right 10 miles in and and that was in March of 2009
01:03:30.38 --> 01:03:36.54 and basically all gets a 2009 I got my you know my ratings back of course 100% and I chose to
01:03:36.54 --> 01:03:43.10 go through the EPLD program extended permanent limited duty and that took all the way to April
01:03:43.10 --> 01:03:50.54 2000 what the end of March of 2010 and actually today April 1st would been was the day that
01:03:50.54 --> 01:03:56.38 I was promoted to Corporal and with a battalion commander that called me when I was in San Antonio was like
01:03:56.38 --> 01:04:00.54 hey congratulations you're getting promoted corporal and I was like sorry is this April Fool's Jo
01:04:00.54 --> 01:04:07.66 you know it's like and it's and but but on April 7 2010 I re-enlisted that raised my right hand
01:04:07.66 --> 01:04:13.66 and got chance to stay in the Marine Corps for a few more years and that was the greatest thing ever
01:04:13.66 --> 01:04:18.14 right there yeah I know that's that's the reason why I started off today reading that off because
01:04:18.14 --> 01:04:22.70 for you to be doing that in the condition you were in having already sacrificed and saying you know
01:04:22.70 --> 01:04:27.18 what I got more to give than I'm going to give it and that's the one thing like when I was
01:04:27.18 --> 01:04:31.82 mentioned lead by example one of my therapist told me you know as I go to therapy every day
01:04:31.82 --> 01:04:36.86 and I put my legs on I stand up I walk out you know just I do my own thing and he's like Matt you
01:04:36.86 --> 01:04:41.58 don't ever you won't see this of course and you will never realize this but every day when you
01:04:41.58 --> 01:04:45.98 walk in here you sit down and you put your prosthetics on and get them walk out people stare at you
01:04:45.98 --> 01:04:50.86 and people look at you and and that's the right thing to lead by example you know it's like if you
01:04:50.86 --> 01:04:55.74 wake up each and every day and you do it the right way then people will follow you know and
01:04:55.74 --> 01:05:01.98 and I've learned now it's like from living my life it's just to wake up and continue doing the right
01:05:01.98 --> 01:05:07.82 thing then people will follow and you know it's it's it's something that I've focused a lot on it's
01:05:07.82 --> 01:05:13.10 not being an intense yelling leader but it's just doing the the right way and that's something
01:05:13.10 --> 01:05:17.90 that I've done along the way and of course in therapy if you're in the Marine in your army gal on
01:05:17.90 --> 01:05:21.58 the ground and you know what that Marine up there walk in is like I need to beat this guy and
01:05:21.58 --> 01:05:29.34 and then you also ended up going to college right I did I did and what year did you start college
01:05:29.90 --> 01:05:35.42 I started in 2011 at Coastal Carolina Community College in Jacksonville North Carolina
01:05:35.42 --> 01:05:39.42 once I re-enlisted they asked me where I wanted to go on and go to the Wounded Warrior
01:05:39.42 --> 01:05:45.34 Battalion East Camp Liging because I realized my I could help out more there and I got there and
01:05:45.82 --> 01:05:50.94 in 2011 I went on a closure trip back to Iraq and that's when I realized that I joined the Marine
01:05:50.94 --> 01:05:55.42 Corps to deploy and I can't deploy now but I could still share my story and I don't have to share
01:05:55.42 --> 01:05:59.66 my story where I need to uniform. Is it the Marine Corps that takes you on the closure trip?
01:05:59.66 --> 01:06:07.02 It was a non-profit first foundation and it's and actually the the episode that I went on
01:06:07.02 --> 01:06:13.74 60 minutes air it in 2011 so it's on YouTube but uh that's a nice plug. Well watch it then.
01:06:13.74 --> 01:06:18.62 But it's but I learned a lot about my time in the Marine Corps and the one thing with the
01:06:18.62 --> 01:06:22.70 being a Marine is you're always a Marine and that's a title I get to take to my grave and
01:06:22.70 --> 01:06:27.82 when I'm 85 years old I could look at my great grandkids and be like I served in the United States
01:06:27.82 --> 01:06:33.34 Marine Corps and so it's and during that time we were starting a family and I was getting ready to take
01:06:33.34 --> 01:06:40.06 college classes so the one thing that I'm very fortunate about is everything through life like
01:06:40.06 --> 01:06:45.82 each step each chapter it comes right after the next one like I never have a time to sit down and
01:06:45.82 --> 01:06:52.22 think about what's next and you know I got out in 2012 and we moved right back to Kentucky and
01:06:52.22 --> 01:06:58.70 I started taking college classes and you know my my brilliant an amazing wife you know while we're
01:06:58.70 --> 01:07:01.82 trying to figure out where we're going to live she's like your dream school is university
01:07:01.82 --> 01:07:06.06 Kentucky so let's move back to there and you can go to school there and graduate there and
01:07:06.78 --> 01:07:12.70 I started taking classes there in 2014 and May of 2017 I walked across the stage at Reparina
01:07:12.70 --> 01:07:18.54 and got my diploma in media arts and history and and it's you know not only a Marine for life
01:07:18.54 --> 01:07:25.58 but a wildcat for life I felt I felt I feel a little strange being that you know the 30 year old
01:07:25.58 --> 01:07:30.22 like kid you know party and like a 10 year old there and when the basketball team won or something like that
01:07:30.22 --> 01:07:36.86 you know I'm just that old creepy dude over there and not the youngster anymore but
01:07:36.86 --> 01:07:41.82 but it was it was fun to go back and take college classes and everything that I learned
01:07:41.82 --> 01:07:47.90 that I should have learned in high school like I'm like loving college now and I spoke at a
01:07:48.86 --> 01:07:53.98 child development center a couple months ago and the kids asking is like what do you think
01:07:53.98 --> 01:07:58.46 of school I'm like you know it's I wasn't the greatest students in high school but I
01:07:58.46 --> 01:08:03.02 I'd tell you what I loved college I love going back in reading books I love to read now and
01:08:03.58 --> 01:08:10.86 and it just expands by mind in my knowledge on things and it's you know it's good going down
01:08:10.86 --> 01:08:16.30 setting down with people and and you could share stories on different things and not just something
01:08:16.30 --> 01:08:22.38 about the military but you could talk about this and this and you know it's it was fun
01:08:23.18 --> 01:08:28.22 it's you you're I want to just kind of jump back to your workouts a little bit and I know you post
01:08:28.22 --> 01:08:33.50 some of your workouts and on on Twitter and stuff some little shots sometimes I know you post one
01:08:33.50 --> 01:08:37.66 the other day if you put pushing the sled you're pushing the push and sled all the way out the
01:08:37.66 --> 01:08:44.14 California legit do you wake up every day is that the first thing you do is is trying to get your
01:08:44.14 --> 01:08:50.14 workout in? I tried to I prefer working out of the morning but now with traveling and you know
01:08:50.14 --> 01:08:55.66 making catching up hours at work I had to do evening workouts which I hate doing evening work
01:08:55.66 --> 01:09:00.70 so I'm ready to get home take my legs off but those are the those are the workout in the evening
01:09:00.70 --> 01:09:05.58 I tried to get them in as much as I possibly can I love to workout and if not then I'll
01:09:05.58 --> 01:09:11.74 do it home I got some dumbbells and curls I'll be curls there and but you know throughout throughout
01:09:11.74 --> 01:09:16.78 the day I'm like constantly on my legs walking around you know doing some cardio but you know
01:09:16.78 --> 01:09:22.30 I love taking shots at you there Jocco on Twitter you know and that's uh I think one of the
01:09:22.30 --> 01:09:26.38 tweets I actually mentioned to you I was like you do this squat and I'll do the push in the sled
01:09:27.98 --> 01:09:32.94 but you know it's like even through even through training my trainer it's funny because I
01:09:32.94 --> 01:09:37.58 joked with him all the time I'm like his name's Josh and I'm like like you're just here to
01:09:37.58 --> 01:09:41.66 walk me from a machine I'm shane all right I'll tell you what I want to work out the day and
01:09:42.22 --> 01:09:47.34 and like if it gets to the point where I'm I'm getting bored doing pull ups put some chains on me
01:09:47.34 --> 01:09:50.78 now do some pull ups with some chains on me and something like that I'll do some pushups or I'll
01:09:50.78 --> 01:09:55.82 get to the bench press and do some chains on the bench press and it's like just something else
01:09:55.82 --> 01:10:00.46 that challenge it and set a stick into the same old thing you know every day thing and it's uh
01:10:00.46 --> 01:10:07.90 and you know a personal best on the bench press couple weeks go at 260 I'm proud of that and then
01:10:07.90 --> 01:10:15.26 course push in the sled and um but now it's like you know I've learned doing the I do Spartan
01:10:15.26 --> 01:10:20.78 races and marathons and I've done a marathon and I did a marathon and I forgot what year was but
01:10:20.78 --> 01:10:25.50 I didn't work out or get back on the bike for a whole year and after doing the next marathon I was
01:10:25.50 --> 01:10:30.14 so sore for like a week and I realized like if I say active in the gym and work out
01:10:30.14 --> 01:10:38.22 and I'm not a sore and um so like I knew flash yeah stay in the gym and it's uh so it's like
01:10:38.22 --> 01:10:42.94 I work out as much as I possibly came because it's like I never know what you know this
01:10:42.94 --> 01:10:46.70 organization I do a lot of events with like sometimes I'll just call me up like hey you
01:10:46.70 --> 01:10:51.74 want to do a Spartan race in two weeks it's like oh sure you know and you know through
01:10:51.74 --> 01:11:03.26 it's like you know through it's like each year I try to find something new to do and for
01:11:03.26 --> 01:11:08.86 some weird reason this year I was like I've got on the stationary bike because my goal is to
01:11:10.14 --> 01:11:15.58 in July I'm going to bike from Seattle to Portland it's like a 203 mile two day event
01:11:15.58 --> 01:11:23.66 and then my ultimate goal and August is the bike across Kentucky on a tandem bike and um so
01:11:23.66 --> 01:11:28.54 I got on the stationary bike in January for the first time I got on any kind of bike in 20 years
01:11:28.54 --> 01:11:34.30 and I'm like holy smokes this is weird and it's like my left leg like the above the knee
01:11:34.30 --> 01:11:38.62 side like it didn't work so well in pedaling so I just took it off and started pedaling on my right
01:11:38.62 --> 01:11:44.54 leg and the most of them was 7.5 miles and 26 minutes and I went to my trainer and I looked at my
01:11:44.54 --> 01:11:49.34 wife and I'm like this is the one thing that I feel like I'm doing normal you know I feel like I
01:11:49.34 --> 01:11:54.62 keep up with somebody with legs and so I really enjoyed that and I'm looking forward to it but
01:11:54.62 --> 01:12:00.14 you know like last year I climbed out right here or half a half a mountain here and this year I'm
01:12:00.14 --> 01:12:06.38 going to go out and sum it up hopefully in July so I just uh anything I can do to really like challenge
01:12:06.38 --> 01:12:12.70 myself and always I always tell my prosthesis and like any like I got the X3 on my left leg which is
01:12:12.70 --> 01:12:19.02 like the best of the best and I'm like my goal in life is to break this leg it's like if I could break it
01:12:19.02 --> 01:12:28.70 then that's that's a check in the box and you know and uh the uh baton death march you were back
01:12:28.70 --> 01:12:33.74 at that thing right I tacked that two weeks ago and I don't know if you know what it feels like
01:12:33.74 --> 01:12:40.22 to run into a train but that's what I felt like Monday afternoon but it was uh the 2009 really
01:12:40.22 --> 01:12:45.26 like I mentioned it humbled me and it motivated me you know for the next 10 years it's like everything
01:12:45.26 --> 01:12:50.70 I'm going to do I'm going to focus on this right here like I went into the baton in 2009 and then my
01:12:50.70 --> 01:12:56.22 prosthetics wasn't as good or advanced as they are now so when I went out there two weeks ago
01:12:57.74 --> 01:13:05.10 I knocked it out 14 miles I knocked out eight miles and we stepped off at 6506 and by 1120 I hit
01:13:05.10 --> 01:13:11.58 eight mile marker they gave me a 45 minute mile pace and I was knocked out of mile and 25 minutes and
01:13:12.22 --> 01:13:18.38 it was I don't know if it was uh my knee was hurting or just the whole fact that I'm getting
01:13:18.38 --> 01:13:22.54 right across the finish line but it was like I get a little emotional I'm like and this is really
01:13:22.54 --> 01:13:28.86 happening you know and to go out and walk this far on two prosthetics and I tell you one thing
01:13:28.86 --> 01:13:34.94 the miles are a lot longer when you can't see that's for sure and but um it was it was fun you
01:13:34.94 --> 01:13:41.82 know and I was I was I was I had my legs for about a week actually this last two days the first
01:13:41.82 --> 01:13:47.66 time I put my legs on for the first time so it's a but you know and that cause you just trashed the skin
01:13:47.66 --> 01:13:52.86 my left leg had a couple of little ropes pots on it and so my wife she took a picture and
01:13:52.86 --> 01:13:57.66 sent my prosthesis and then she become my nurse and but not to mention the satisfactory and it's
01:13:57.66 --> 01:14:03.98 walked 3.6 five miles in a like a they called it's around the bluegrass and Lexington and my wife
01:14:03.98 --> 01:14:08.54 she sent me a text and she's like I think about walking this that you can get your wheelchair and
01:14:08.54 --> 01:14:13.02 I'll push you like I'm not gonna get a medal set in a wheelchair right I'm gonna go to walk it
01:14:13.02 --> 01:14:19.02 or I'm not gonna do it okay and so we signed up for the 3.65 miles and we will finish that
01:14:19.02 --> 01:14:24.70 and an hour and 23 minutes and for some weird reason I think walking might be my thing this year too
01:14:25.74 --> 01:14:31.10 but that's to get you out and do a race with us coming get it okay I've been I've been looking into
01:14:31.10 --> 01:14:38.30 the what's the navy still obstacle course oh the uh look you mean the one that's in Coronado
01:14:38.30 --> 01:14:44.30 the actual obstacle course oh no no not that one I'm not that fancy I'm a married is it is it the
01:14:44.30 --> 01:14:50.14 bonafrog or bonafrog or bonafrog yeah yeah so I've been looking into that so right on well I'm sure
01:14:50.14 --> 01:14:54.06 those guys will hook you up if you want to go get after it yeah I don't know big on the water
01:14:54.06 --> 01:14:58.70 except I have like you know what do you have everything else that might not be a great combination
01:14:58.70 --> 01:15:02.78 if you don't like the water too much because I'm sure they put some water to that there that's uh yeah that's
01:15:02.78 --> 01:15:08.38 no hey what was that what was that closure trip you know speaking about emotional about how to be
01:15:08.38 --> 01:15:16.22 emotional going going to Iraq again it was the whole um when it was mentioned to me in 2011
01:15:16.78 --> 01:15:21.82 the only image in my mind that kept popping up is like either a black hot going down or see one
01:15:21.82 --> 01:15:26.78 30 or something happening because it's like I walked away actually I was medivact out of that
01:15:26.78 --> 01:15:34.38 country you know from from my injuries so it's like I had no good image of that country at all and
01:15:35.02 --> 01:15:39.42 it was nerve-racking it was even more nerve-racking being around like the Iraqi security forces
01:15:40.06 --> 01:15:46.62 you know their clear in rooms and doing Mount Traini and here we stand with no weapons or
01:15:46.62 --> 01:15:52.94 anything like when I was in Iraq nor he said rifles or AKs and so that that really kind of um
01:15:52.94 --> 01:15:59.10 it it made me worried a lot but I think one of the coolest moments that that really helped me
01:15:59.66 --> 01:16:05.02 understand it was we were meeting the Iraqi security forces and they were all walking up shaking our hands and
01:16:05.66 --> 01:16:12.30 you know good uniforms and um they had a patch and one of the guys took his patch off and put it on my
01:16:12.30 --> 01:16:17.82 flag jacket and gave me a big hug and I'm like you know what this is this is it one team one fight here you know and
01:16:17.82 --> 01:16:23.18 there's there's bad people all over this world but there's a lot more good people in this world too and
01:16:23.82 --> 01:16:32.86 and I think and it really um it made the trip as we were flying back home we were going over Iceland
01:16:32.86 --> 01:16:36.78 and the pilot brought back this little letter and he gave me to my buddy and my buddy right
01:16:36.78 --> 01:16:41.42 at two minutes said US forces have killed us on bin Laden and I was like you know what that's the
01:16:41.42 --> 01:16:49.82 perfect closure to a closure trip because like we all joined the military after 2001 to go after him you know
01:16:49.82 --> 01:16:58.78 to kill him and and knowing that this happened on my closure trip it's like it honestly like gave me
01:16:58.78 --> 01:17:04.78 it got me emotional I was just ready to go home with my family and that that kept it off pretty well
01:17:04.78 --> 01:17:11.34 and I will say when I was in Iraq in 2006 so Dom who sang was killed and so so Dom who sang
01:17:11.34 --> 01:17:16.86 the song been a lot and you know so it's like why not but you know like I got so much other
01:17:16.86 --> 01:17:21.66 that closure trip I learned a lot about my life and like what the next step in my life is and
01:17:22.30 --> 01:17:25.66 like I mentioned earlier like when I went back to Afghanistan in 2017
01:17:26.38 --> 01:17:31.10 never been Afghanistan before my life but I felt like I got more of that closure trip because
01:17:31.10 --> 01:17:35.10 going to Iraq in 2011 I was still in the Marine Corps where in the uniform every day
01:17:35.10 --> 01:17:40.62 and I've been staying out of the uniform on in five years and to put the uniform back on and
01:17:41.42 --> 01:17:48.30 go around and speak to soldiers about my Marine Corps career and be around the military again
01:17:48.30 --> 01:17:53.82 truly made me miss it more than anything in the world and you know the brothers that I met in the
01:17:53.82 --> 01:17:59.74 Marine Corps and in the military alone like they're forever going to be there you know no matter
01:17:59.74 --> 01:18:05.98 where you live out in this country they're always going to be there for you and knowing that the
01:18:05.98 --> 01:18:11.98 you know the the name tag across your chest you know the states of America that that means more
01:18:11.98 --> 01:18:17.34 to me than anything in this world and if if I was called back to serve this country again and again
01:18:17.34 --> 01:18:22.46 no one the risk and what could happen to me then I'd go back and do it all over again because
01:18:22.46 --> 01:18:27.90 these last 12 years have been truly amazing and I've done things that I would never thought I could
01:18:27.90 --> 01:18:35.34 do and I've done it differently and like through the adrenaline through the adversity and it's just
01:18:35.34 --> 01:18:42.14 it's inspired and motivated me to come along the way and you know and it's it's it's a life I love
01:18:42.14 --> 01:18:48.78 the live and even in the dark but I know one day will come and there will be light in my eyes you know
01:18:48.78 --> 01:18:53.02 and I'll be able to open my eyes and see every day but for right now I'm going to live my life
01:18:53.02 --> 01:19:02.70 to the fullest that that's incredible do you do you ever you know I I'll hear from people all the time
01:19:02.70 --> 01:19:07.34 oh I don't feel like doing this today I don't feel like doing I don't want to work out today I don't
01:19:07.34 --> 01:19:12.62 want to I don't want to get up and do my job today you know does that wait when you hear that
01:19:12.62 --> 01:19:19.02 kind of thing what are your thoughts on that I know for me personally when I wake up and I don't
01:19:19.02 --> 01:19:24.06 feel like doing something then I try to or if I feel like I'm in a down mood then I try to keep that
01:19:24.06 --> 01:19:28.38 in in the house like I don't want to go out into public because I don't want people to see that
01:19:28.38 --> 01:19:34.86 like when I go out in public I want them to see happy mat you know positive but here in people
01:19:34.86 --> 01:19:40.22 like just it's it's hard to hear people complain about things these days you know and
01:19:40.86 --> 01:19:45.74 because you know I know what Iraq looked like and you know I was in Afghanistan and you know
01:19:45.74 --> 01:19:50.06 I know what happened to me and I know where I was 12 years ago and what I had to do to overcome that
01:19:50.62 --> 01:19:55.82 you know and it's just some people just when they feel like they can't do it they just get down in the
01:19:55.82 --> 01:20:02.62 dumps and they give up and really it's like you got to learn to battle through those adversities
01:20:02.62 --> 01:20:06.14 and you know at the end of the day when you put your head down the pillow and close your eyes you wake
01:20:06.14 --> 01:20:11.42 up to a new day you know and a new day with new challenges but you got to learn to overcome those
01:20:11.42 --> 01:20:16.38 challenges because in life it's a mountain you're going to continue to climb up a mountain and it's
01:20:16.38 --> 01:20:20.06 never going to flatten out you're constantly going to go over any you know obstacles,
01:20:20.06 --> 01:20:25.02 boulders, whatever's in your way and the only way to go over is to climb it it's not to find
01:20:25.02 --> 01:20:29.42 an easy way around or turn around and quit you know and you got to learn to just overcome things
01:20:29.42 --> 01:20:40.46 and and honestly never give up never quit okay you know I clearly you represent that to the fullest
01:20:40.46 --> 01:20:45.42 so what are you doing right now in terms I know you got a job what's that what's that all about
01:20:45.98 --> 01:20:52.62 so it's funny how I got this job because my last year at UK I was I had to go for an internship
01:20:53.26 --> 01:20:58.94 and the internship internship that I was going for was at the where I go hunting at
01:20:59.50 --> 01:21:03.10 and I was like okay well do that but then like people kept tagging me on Facebook about this
01:21:03.10 --> 01:21:06.62 moon warrior fellowship position that was opening up and it's like Matt you should try this out
01:21:06.62 --> 01:21:11.26 and I contacted one of my friends and and he was like hey I just showed up at our office on this
01:21:11.26 --> 01:21:16.30 date and you could intern with us and then we'll talk about the position and I showed up on the
01:21:16.30 --> 01:21:21.58 first date at our office and everybody's like who are you like and then he ended up getting kind
01:21:21.58 --> 01:21:27.82 of in trouble for this but but it was a you know intern there and then went through the interview
01:21:27.82 --> 01:21:33.18 and June and basically was hired on the spot and I've been working with the congressional office
01:21:33.18 --> 01:21:38.06 for two years doing veterans outreach you know we do some case work with veterans but
01:21:38.62 --> 01:21:42.14 truly it's just getting out of the district and being around veterans and kind of letting them
01:21:42.14 --> 01:21:47.74 know what kind of legislative bills are out there that could affect them both positive and negatively
01:21:47.74 --> 01:21:53.34 I mean there's so much out there that they need to know about and it's been truly a joy you know
01:21:53.34 --> 01:21:57.74 getting it will work with a lot of Vietnam veterans and you know these are some of the happiest
01:21:57.74 --> 01:22:03.82 guys that I've ever met my life for what they had to go through you know and and just hearing them
01:22:03.82 --> 01:22:09.90 walk up to me and be like because I've had them come just to our office and tears just to like
01:22:09.90 --> 01:22:14.62 to shake my hand or get a hug from me and stuff like that going through you know heart problems
01:22:14.62 --> 01:22:19.74 or whatever and they're like you know what just being here and seeing you and what you've gone through
01:22:20.30 --> 01:22:25.18 that motivates me to continue doing what I'm doing because you're inspiring me and it brings tears
01:22:25.18 --> 01:22:30.38 to my eyes because it's like you know it's as a veteran you know veteran serving veterans we need
01:22:30.38 --> 01:22:35.02 to look out for our own it doesn't matter if it's a job or not but you know the suicide right
01:22:35.02 --> 01:22:40.94 right now is sad and you know we got to learn to reach out and be with each other because we're the
01:22:40.94 --> 01:22:45.58 only ones that trust and the only ones that have opened up to each other and that's the one thing
01:22:45.58 --> 01:22:51.02 that I've really you know I've tried at first which is very hard to keep my personal life from
01:22:51.02 --> 01:22:58.14 my work side but you know these it's when you sit down you talk to a veteran and you share what you
01:22:58.14 --> 01:23:03.34 went through and and they share what they went through and you kind of come together and you talk
01:23:03.34 --> 01:23:08.46 about things and you know at the end of the day that you're helping them out just as much as
01:23:08.46 --> 01:23:13.50 they're helping you out it truly means the world and it's it knows that you know veteran
01:23:13.50 --> 01:23:21.66 serving veterans we need to stick to the other yeah there's no doubt and you're doing all that and you're
01:23:21.66 --> 01:23:27.58 also raising three kids three kids three amazing kids actually and you know my wife and I
01:23:27.58 --> 01:23:34.54 wear a April 7th to be our seventh wedding anniversary so we're you know it's through it all the
01:23:34.54 --> 01:23:39.42 one thing that if I could teach anybody in life it's teaching those kids that you know challenges
01:23:39.42 --> 01:23:45.82 are going to come but you've got to find a way life isn't easy life's hard and and if they could
01:23:45.82 --> 01:23:51.58 look at me and look at what I've gone through and what I continue to do today and use that as motivation
01:23:51.58 --> 01:23:57.18 to you know better themselves and better their lives and understand that yes I might have failed
01:23:57.18 --> 01:24:00.62 this test but you know what I'm going to go home and I'm going to get in the book and I want to
01:24:00.62 --> 01:24:04.86 I'm going to get an A on this next one and that's all the matters and you know talk about
01:24:04.86 --> 01:24:10.54 them a little bit it's Nolan who's 15 he'll turn 16 and a couple weeks a couple years ago we had
01:24:10.54 --> 01:24:18.14 a birthday party and there is this girl in his class or in his school that had no arms and no
01:24:18.14 --> 01:24:27.66 legs and he didn't know her but he went up to her and gave her a birthday he invited her to his birthday
01:24:27.66 --> 01:24:33.10 and it like he come home and told me in a man to that and that truly brought tears to our eyes
01:24:33.10 --> 01:24:40.54 because it's like they get it you know when I was their age if I saw a kid that was in you know a
01:24:40.54 --> 01:24:45.34 special wedge class I didn't walk up and try to talk to him you know I felt like they were different
01:24:45.34 --> 01:24:50.14 than me and I say to away from that but you know Nolan that he walked up to a grill with no
01:24:50.14 --> 01:24:55.66 arms and no legs and was you know and Vited heard to his birthday party truly brought tears to our eyes
01:24:55.66 --> 01:25:02.30 because it's like again he gets it he's growing up he's a man right now you know and Emma she is just
01:25:02.30 --> 01:25:08.62 as mature as she is so helpful and caring and compassionate and Leyla is the same thing you know she's
01:25:08.62 --> 01:25:13.58 seven years old right now but it's the cutest thing in the world is that you hear her get around
01:25:13.58 --> 01:25:20.38 her friends and tell her stories about how I got hurt you know somehow the bad guys blew my legs
01:25:20.38 --> 01:25:25.02 off and killed me and she told her teacher that and I can only imagine where teacher thought when
01:25:25.02 --> 01:25:30.78 I walked into class room you know but what it's just you know they're always there if I need them
01:25:30.78 --> 01:25:36.70 they're there to help out and you know to to my wife I mean she's truly amazing she has a job
01:25:36.70 --> 01:25:42.14 herself but she stops everything she can to get me to work me to an event me to a speaking
01:25:42.14 --> 01:25:47.50 engagement to wherever to get the three kids to wherever they need to go our two girls are in horse
01:25:47.50 --> 01:25:53.82 back riding lessons right now and still she finds time to work out twice a day actually
01:25:53.82 --> 01:26:02.78 she you know not to not to too job and and it's you know she's does dinner laundry everything
01:26:02.78 --> 01:26:06.94 and then she still crawls in bed by eight o'clock at night I mean you know if there's a motivation
01:26:06.94 --> 01:26:12.14 in my life and there's a true hero for me to look up to it's her because she's truly amazing
01:26:12.14 --> 01:26:18.30 and I couldn't ask for a better wife and a better you know friend best friend role model mentor
01:26:18.30 --> 01:26:24.06 and you know if there's any award out there to give to her then I mean I would I would be up for
01:26:24.06 --> 01:26:31.50 not be the first one to sign onto it that's that awesome it sounds like you uh sounds like you
01:26:31.50 --> 01:26:37.26 found the perfect perfect perfect girl for you she is and you know throughout all this it's you know
01:26:37.26 --> 01:26:42.86 the the hardest thing is to to set back and like appreciate it and the one thing that I truly
01:26:42.86 --> 01:26:47.66 don't like I always cross if I cross a finish line I always look to see what's next I don't
01:26:47.66 --> 01:26:53.66 set back and enjoy it and she's there to kind of like to honestly humble me a little bit and
01:26:54.38 --> 01:27:01.90 to set back and like let me remember what I went through to get to where I am today and without her
01:27:01.90 --> 01:27:07.34 I don't know if I could live this life right now you know it's always talk about it it's um
01:27:08.14 --> 01:27:14.62 you know it's a tough road you know I'm I am blind I have bad days and some days I don't want to
01:27:14.62 --> 01:27:22.38 wake up and go on but I tell you every day you know every night I pray that maybe one day I'll
01:27:22.38 --> 01:27:27.26 wake up and I'll be able to see my wife and my kids and when I wake up I still look at darkness
01:27:27.26 --> 01:27:32.30 and then I go through my morning routine and I still grab my prosthetic legs and I put them on
01:27:32.30 --> 01:27:38.70 so I'm constantly reminded of January 18th 2007 and I use that motivation to go on and love my family
01:27:38.70 --> 01:27:42.94 and love my kids and go out and do these extraordinary things because I'm never going to let
01:27:42.94 --> 01:27:47.58 that guy who pushed that button and blew me up to feet me even though I don't know where he's at right
01:27:47.58 --> 01:27:52.70 now he's never going to get the sense of comfort relief that he defeated me that day and you know
01:27:52.70 --> 01:27:57.66 while I'm going through these bad moments I mean nothing suits the soul and makes the heart
01:27:57.66 --> 01:28:03.02 feel so much better than here and you're seven year old daughter walk into and say hey daddy I love you
01:28:03.02 --> 01:28:14.94 all right man I don't even know if I have anything I'd say after that man that's just uh
01:28:16.30 --> 01:28:18.14 that's awesome um I
01:28:19.90 --> 01:28:25.82 yeah man I think we're good I think we're good I think I think that's a good place to stop
01:28:25.82 --> 01:28:37.02 uh man it's just awesome to sit here and talk to you and you know hear your story um I know
01:28:37.02 --> 01:28:41.90 Echo's got a couple things to cover what do you got Echo? Sure, she's yeah
01:28:43.34 --> 01:28:50.22 it I always think about this too like you know how um Matt you're saying like you can choose to
01:28:50.22 --> 01:28:56.94 kind of go down to past right so and it this picture starts to get uh kind of painted in my head
01:28:56.94 --> 01:29:02.70 when I hear like these cool stories so like I don't know you know like if you're uh it's gonna be
01:29:02.70 --> 01:29:06.46 a bad analogy but bear with we all know you're good yeah we all know you're good if
01:29:06.46 --> 01:29:12.78 Matt and Alex are in here so let's say you're trying to I don't know like let's say you have
01:29:12.78 --> 01:29:20.30 an ant problem right you mean like little bugs ants okay not like you're not like my ant
01:29:20.30 --> 01:29:26.38 one oh no no nothing okay so let's say I'm an ant problem right so it's it's it's it's you
01:29:26.38 --> 01:29:30.30 against the ant right so let's say you say okay I'm gonna set out these traps for the
01:29:30.30 --> 01:29:37.98 it's not ants let's say mice let's say you got ant traps you know so let's say you put a mouse trap
01:29:37.98 --> 01:29:44.46 out for your uh mouse problem okay and then uh you know someone uh or a mouse comes and gets caught
01:29:44.46 --> 01:29:50.06 in the trap yeah you don't kill it though you're trying to kill all the mice right okay
01:29:50.06 --> 01:29:54.62 you don't kill the mouse the mouse like somehow you mess it up though but the mouse gets away
01:29:55.74 --> 01:30:01.42 so not only did you not kill the and then the mouse now goes recovers and now teaches all other mice
01:30:01.42 --> 01:30:08.86 how to get past mouse traps okay your mouse trap kind of worked against you so like just like
01:30:08.86 --> 01:30:14.54 when Matt said oh yeah they guy who pressed the button to you know to blow up the bomb yeah
01:30:14.54 --> 01:30:18.78 me he did the opposite of what he was trying to do see I'm saying oh I see what you're saying
01:30:18.78 --> 01:30:23.90 he's actually a good analogy okay great it for that one not saying that Matt is a mouse I'm not saying
01:30:23.90 --> 01:30:29.98 that but I'm just saying you know concept but he has the the wheel and fortitude and the lessons
01:30:29.98 --> 01:30:35.26 yeah most important so the guy who made the bomb kind of screwed himself yeah you know I mean in this big
01:30:35.26 --> 01:30:41.82 way and it's you know kind of it's hard to say that he's just called me a mouse but
01:30:42.30 --> 01:30:47.98 you know it's like at the end of the day it's like you know I look back at you all together just
01:30:47.98 --> 01:30:53.26 being a marine you know never quit never quit on my brothers and never quitting on the situation
01:30:53.26 --> 01:30:58.78 it's given to me and I'll use you know the amputations and the blindness and all this stuff
01:30:58.78 --> 01:31:04.22 stacked against me as motivation you know and every now and then it like steers it's ugly head
01:31:04.22 --> 01:31:09.26 but you know thankfully for my wife my family and you know the mindset and mentality that I have
01:31:09.26 --> 01:31:14.46 right now and the friends that I've surrounded myself with that you know I kind of push it back and
01:31:15.18 --> 01:31:21.90 kick it's butt yeah sure indeed speak to kick and butt yes what do you got for us
01:31:21.90 --> 01:31:26.38 our path Matt's on the path he's been on the path Matt he's trying to do you have your
01:31:26.38 --> 01:31:30.30 try to get to yet if you could teach a blind guy on the legs you did so then I'm all for
01:31:30.30 --> 01:31:35.02 yes well I've definitely taught blind guys do you and I've definitely taught guys with no legs do you
01:31:35.02 --> 01:31:41.42 do you do well let's put them together I think you might find it easier than the beton death march
01:31:41.42 --> 01:31:45.58 yes yeah now man you can definitely you can train uh do you do all day long
01:31:46.30 --> 01:31:51.50 Ryan Job you know one of my guys who who was blinded in uh I trained with him and he he wrestled
01:31:51.50 --> 01:31:58.22 to in high school so he had some background but yeah you can there's people that competitively
01:31:59.02 --> 01:32:04.70 yeah that compete with with no vision and the no legs thing well that you just learned

01:32:26.86 --> 01:32:32.70 the guy yep like being able to see him isn't that much of an advantage I sometimes close my eyes
01:32:32.70 --> 01:32:39.66 just so yeah the thing with grappling is you learn well you learn to know what the other
01:32:39.66 --> 01:32:43.18 person's doing by feel and you don't really because you can't see what are you gonna see
01:32:43.18 --> 01:32:49.02 anyways you see like their arm pit yeah whatever you see there yeah so you don't get to see

01:32:53.26 --> 01:32:58.38 we got a video of him and I grapple and it's harder because like I could put him in a headlock
01:32:58.38 --> 01:33:03.18 but you know my legs I can't do much with that but they have a video of me like taping him out
01:33:03.18 --> 01:33:10.54 because he's like right he bright red it's like well now a million people are gonna want to see

01:34:53.66 --> 01:34:57.90 that's the plight and just for the future and which is good but the way plans for the future
01:34:57.90 --> 01:35:02.06 plans but that's not a future plan that's we like future plans but we really like
01:35:02.06 --> 01:35:08.62 actually this is happening yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah think about America
01:35:08.62 --> 01:35:15.90 jeans were made or created in America created here invented here and all of a sudden
01:35:15.90 --> 01:35:19.66 they're getting made overseas and these and there's no Americans that are making
01:35:19.66 --> 01:35:25.42 them well there are now yeah there are now in a factory informing to Maine oh yeah
01:35:25.42 --> 01:35:32.54 that's what we're doing yes origin main dot com go there geek rash guards denim joggers
01:35:33.82 --> 01:35:41.10 dog or something yeah yeah oh yeah so I'm bad man I twisted my knee out doing
01:35:41.10 --> 01:35:46.22 you yeah like the kind of popped up pop back in yeah they do that they're skinny yes but they're
01:35:46.22 --> 01:35:52.14 loose too strangely strangely actually my knees are so loose I can't with the knees I know
01:35:52.14 --> 01:35:57.42 but my knees are so loose that I like sprained it one time so I went to the orthopedic
01:35:57.42 --> 01:36:00.86 surgeon you know check it out he was like oh yeah you blew your ACL that was like
01:36:01.82 --> 01:36:07.74 since I really did blow my ACL 10 to 12 to land like 15 years earlier my other site
01:36:08.62 --> 01:36:12.70 I knew that my knees were loose because the gut the doctor at that time was like hey you have
01:36:12.70 --> 01:36:17.34 really like I don't know long legaments I don't know I know that sounds funny like long legaments
01:36:17.34 --> 01:36:22.46 I know but that's what he said yeah anyway so I was like hey are you sure you just didn't say
01:36:22.46 --> 01:36:31.18 you had to do anything anyway he says yeah you have loose like ligaments or whatever
01:36:31.18 --> 01:36:35.34 but this is how you know this one is blown out and this one is not because when you pull it the
01:36:35.34 --> 01:36:40.30 one that's not blown out boom it has a tight like cord at the end of it where it just stops
01:36:40.30 --> 01:36:44.14 anyway so my current orthopedic surgeon I told him that he was like okay that's good that
01:36:44.14 --> 01:36:47.90 you told me that so he tries the other one and like he's like oh yeah they're the same like
01:36:47.90 --> 01:36:53.34 they're so it's probably not blown out but hey am I right anyway am I wrong anyway
01:36:54.06 --> 01:36:58.86 back to my story so they pop out right that's their thing when I twist them along they'll pop out
01:36:58.86 --> 01:37:02.94 so I'm not gonna pop out so much that it'll like kind of make the cartilage swell on the outside
01:37:03.66 --> 01:37:08.94 so it takes a few days so I didn't until I can bend them all away and I'm pretty slow
01:37:08.94 --> 01:37:15.10 by the way from the last once I did that double dose joint warfare and cruel oil
01:37:16.06 --> 01:37:21.10 for a day it's back in the game that's that's quick yes that's quick first we got them
01:37:21.10 --> 01:37:26.62 uh mulk yes additional protein yep additional protein we got the discipline go
01:37:27.42 --> 01:37:32.14 and the discipline and we got the warrior kid mulk I got to get you some warrior kid mulk for
01:37:32.14 --> 01:37:38.30 your kid's mat so what it is is like do you kid's like chocolate milk they do
01:37:38.30 --> 01:37:42.14 do they like do you have her strawberry chocolate well was that strawberry milk yeah
01:37:42.14 --> 01:37:47.82 do you have that one my my leila seven year old she lost strawberry milk okay yeah so unfortunately
01:37:48.62 --> 01:37:52.86 the milk the strawberry milk that you have to give your kids is horrible form even though it tastes
01:37:52.86 --> 01:37:57.10 delicious I guess well there's like some protein in it right there's some nutritional value
01:37:57.10 --> 01:38:01.34 because it does have some protein because there's milk in it but you're also ladening them
01:38:01.34 --> 01:38:09.82 with sugar which is not good for them so yeah it is addictive so we solved this problem
01:38:09.82 --> 01:38:15.90 and we made warrior kid mulk it tastes delicious I'm telling you it tastes like I don't know
01:38:15.90 --> 01:38:19.74 from the supposed to say this but it tastes like the Nestle's quick strawberry milk you know what I'm
01:38:19.74 --> 01:38:26.62 talking about yeah it tastes like it's that good I'm not kidding leila will be all over this stuff
01:38:26.62 --> 01:38:31.82 she will be stoked if they like strawberry that's the right yeah so we'll get to some of that
01:38:31.82 --> 01:38:36.38 and anyone else out there that wants to raise it warrior kids that doesn't want to give
01:38:36.38 --> 01:38:43.18 you kid a bunch of actual poison sugar actual poison oh yeah and here's the thing about sugar
01:38:43.18 --> 01:38:48.46 too and try to read a little thing about this but I've noticed this so you know how like
01:38:49.42 --> 01:38:53.50 when you they're like little babies or whatever you'll give them like I don't know all kinds of
01:38:53.50 --> 01:38:59.18 stuff and let's say you give them formula but the formula is kind of sweet and right so it's like
01:38:59.18 --> 01:39:04.30 it's sweet and so they'll like it so they'll eat it but if you don't give them any sweet stuff even
01:39:04.30 --> 01:39:11.10 when they grow up they'll like they'll only eat normal stuff like unsweetened stuff you know so I'll
01:39:11.10 --> 01:39:16.86 use myself as a small example oh no it's you know you know like the fruit nut fruit punch but like
01:39:16.86 --> 01:39:23.18 orange juice concentrate when you make orange juice you put orange juice concentrate and then you get uh water yes
01:39:23.18 --> 01:39:32.14 yes water it all is but how you do it is you go um it's like a 12 ounce concentrate yeah we'll say
01:39:32.14 --> 01:39:37.82 we'll say I think it's 12 ounces put the concentrate in and then you fill that same 12 ounce container
01:39:37.82 --> 01:39:43.90 that the concentrate was in with water four times okay right little did I know it was really three times
01:39:43.90 --> 01:39:47.66 that's how much you're supposed that's the recommended but my mom always did the four times
01:39:47.66 --> 01:39:52.78 she was trying to save money too oh yeah yeah yeah that's what it would have been my family
01:39:52.78 --> 01:39:55.90 well she was like okay we throw it six of that
01:39:56.62 --> 01:40:01.02 nonetheless I was used to it I was totally used to it so then later on when I found out in high school
01:40:01.02 --> 01:40:05.98 by the way that it was really uh three yeah I was like I can't do the three it's way too sweet
01:40:05.98 --> 01:40:11.02 yeah your mom soon saying saved money and made you more healthy there ready to go mama
01:40:11.02 --> 01:40:15.90 there you go ready go the right path yes yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
01:40:15.90 --> 01:40:20.94 yeah so think about that and when you think about that think about this jocco has a store it's called
01:40:20.94 --> 01:40:25.50 jocco store so when you're on the path you want to represent while being on the path that's where
01:40:25.50 --> 01:40:30.22 you go you can get your t-shirt it's this split equals freedom good good shirt
01:40:31.02 --> 01:40:36.70 oh the new one on the new the new good shirt yeah yeah with less of my head all the way yeah
01:40:36.70 --> 01:40:41.82 yeah it is weird especially after a while when like you know you look in the mirror and it's like
01:40:41.82 --> 01:40:45.82 good yeah I get the message but you got to see jocco's face or whatever and you know sometimes
01:40:45.82 --> 01:40:49.42 you're not in the mood for that you just get the other one do you sell your t-shirts any
01:40:49.42 --> 01:40:54.22 more math there I'm a website okay and we're in the process of getting right now he's got the
01:40:54.22 --> 01:40:59.90 cotton shirts but we're working on you know workout shirts as well okay and um but yeah and that's
01:40:59.90 --> 01:41:10.06 Matthew Bradford dot com Matthew Dash Bradford dot com yeah there's they're on there as well
01:41:10.06 --> 01:41:16.54 and you can also go on there and request speaking engagements as well and book me but yeah
01:41:16.54 --> 01:41:23.10 the shirts are there and hashtag on the front of them and the hashtag on the front is no vision no
01:41:23.10 --> 01:41:28.78 legs no problem no legs no vision no problem oh it's right now it's a different
01:41:28.78 --> 01:41:36.38 it's it's hilarious here and people just go after the hashtag it's like no site no legs no vision
01:41:36.38 --> 01:41:41.34 it's like no eyes it's like first of all I got one eye at least no with the prosthetic but
01:41:42.06 --> 01:41:47.42 but yeah it's you know that's something I come up with like a couple years ago like doing an event
01:41:47.42 --> 01:41:51.10 and it's like you know what it just kind of stuck and next thing you know here we go like no
01:41:51.10 --> 01:41:56.62 vision no problem and those uh the workouts shirts you're talking about what do you what like a
01:41:56.62 --> 01:42:01.66 dry fit kind of situation and what kind of like a draft it but then also the discipline equals
01:42:01.66 --> 01:42:07.02 freedom t-shirt the what the material you all use yeah that's like that material because yeah
01:42:07.02 --> 01:42:12.30 feel like when I work out get good numbers and I got the discipline equals freedom t-shirt on so
01:42:12.30 --> 01:42:18.30 oh yeah like I just like I'm gonna act you more on the way on a placebo yeah well you know
01:42:18.30 --> 01:42:22.14 it's one of those things right it's like what do you call it murmuring up wait let me ask you this
01:42:22.14 --> 01:42:28.22 if the placebo is works is it really a placebo because that's you know we could debate that later
01:42:28.22 --> 01:42:32.86 you don't know about it but you gotta be careful if you have Matt's all vacation so you're not
01:42:32.86 --> 01:42:37.18 talking about we want to get somebody else in here for that one yeah that goes gonna start telling
01:42:37.18 --> 01:42:43.66 the story about like coolators something mixin it up how much water goes in there maybe
01:42:43.66 --> 01:42:51.18 maybe anyway you want to represent on the path jockelstore dot com if you see something you like
01:42:51.18 --> 01:42:56.46 get something how's this how's this yes lightweight hoodies oh they're in oh I know they're in
01:42:56.46 --> 01:43:05.10 they're up they're representative of quality little dash of fashion I'm gonna say it's
01:43:05.10 --> 01:43:09.02 see Matt you're probably down so he's wearing a lightweight from yeah if you're just
01:43:09.02 --> 01:43:13.34 right now he's living in Kentucky oh yeah exactly there's a more often you're gonna need that
01:43:13.34 --> 01:43:18.38 Kentucky but if I'm a main you're not gonna need that lightweight holdy what all right well I'm
01:43:18.38 --> 01:43:22.78 gonna be emerging camp I'm bring one I'm gonna wear one how about that emerging camp emerging
01:43:22.78 --> 01:43:26.62 emerging camp the origin emerging camp we haven't talked about that because it's almost sold
01:43:26.62 --> 01:43:31.02 about go to what I know where the more you may talk about if you want to go to that
01:43:31.90 --> 01:43:35.66 jit to camp if you want to come to that Matt let me know all right what is it again it's an
01:43:35.66 --> 01:43:46.22 August it's it's fun we do jit to 24 hours a day yeah yeah yeah we did it we rocked it it's
01:43:46.22 --> 01:43:51.98 good time jocowite you can get that as well if you can't deadlift 8000 pounds you might
01:43:51.98 --> 01:43:57.42 want to order it quickly because if you drink jocowite there's a 100% scientific guarantee
01:43:57.42 --> 01:44:01.82 that you'll be able to deadlift a minimum of 8000 pounds some people are coming in higher than
01:44:01.82 --> 01:44:10.14 that which is fine not a placebo no no no it's 100% uh you can subscribe to this podcast
01:44:10.14 --> 01:44:15.50 because echo thinks that you've listened to a hundred and seventy one podcast and maybe you
01:44:15.50 --> 01:44:20.38 haven't hit subscribe yet well I'm fortunate for me actually it's a pleasure to do it
01:44:20.38 --> 01:44:23.74 then that no echo is proven right because then a bunch of people when I made fun of you for that
01:44:23.74 --> 01:44:28.62 a bunch of people rally to your defense yeah man because it's a whole little group that
01:44:28.62 --> 01:44:32.30 will rally to your defense because I have a good point sometimes not all the time
01:44:32.30 --> 01:44:39.18 now that it's just come on uh subscribe oh we also don't forget about the warrior kid podcast
01:44:39.18 --> 01:44:44.06 we just released a couple more episodes stories from Uncle Jake yeah those stories are good
01:44:44.06 --> 01:44:48.30 I love those stories I'm gonna publish a book with those stories by the way good idea yeah I
01:44:48.30 --> 01:44:54.54 know it's a big shocker don't forget to warrior kid so from Irish oats oats ranch actually it's
01:44:54.54 --> 01:45:00.62 not for kids it's so made by a kid but it's not for kids right it's for humans in general
01:45:00.62 --> 01:45:10.70 that need to stay clean yes also youtube if you are interested in the video version of this podcast
01:45:11.26 --> 01:45:15.50 you want to see what Matt looks like yeah see what jocca looks like if you're a
01:45:15.50 --> 01:45:21.34 non-in and uh yeah I was explaining to Matt I'll explain to everyone as everyone knows
01:45:22.30 --> 01:45:30.30 echo does not sound like he looks like you know we all know that echo sounds just I'm just gonna say
01:45:30.30 --> 01:45:41.66 echo sound skinny and weak thank you bad way no offense but echo sounds my kids always make
01:45:41.66 --> 01:45:48.70 fun of that this the hey no offense but I'm gonna say something to you offensive so I was
01:45:48.70 --> 01:45:53.98 explaining to Matt like listen bro most people when they see echo and they meet him they go oh
01:45:53.98 --> 01:45:57.18 okay cool he's not really they think to themselves he's not he's not he's not looked like the way he
01:45:57.18 --> 01:46:03.26 sounds you so I just say Matt I know you can't see echo but he doesn't look the way he sounds
01:46:04.70 --> 01:46:10.38 Matt's like oh good cool thanks because otherwise he you know he might have said something like
01:46:10.38 --> 01:46:14.06 you know maybe if you're trying to put on weight like maybe echo needs to all right just by
01:46:14.06 --> 01:46:22.38 sound like you maybe need to do some squats when I was in the hospital I had like a color
01:46:22.38 --> 01:46:25.74 every time I would make fun of somebody then they would be in the room and I didn't know that
01:46:25.74 --> 01:46:30.38 then they'd like blue blue blue it's like you'd like get my mind off of like what I was
01:46:30.38 --> 01:46:37.50 gonna say and like oh okay why are you saying the color right now oh that's good yeah that
01:46:37.50 --> 01:46:42.86 is good actually so yeah YouTube videos there's also echoes enhanced YouTube videos I just

01:47:12.78 --> 01:47:16.46 you see I want that says discipline equals freedom and by the way I didn't really know this until
01:47:16.46 --> 01:47:22.62 the other day and I hate to even do this because uh Dakota Meyer get mad at me but he kind of takes
01:47:22.62 --> 01:47:28.94 requests so if you heard something on this podcast and you said to yourself dang when when
01:47:28.94 --> 01:47:36.94 Matt Bradford said this when Matt Bradford said just walk I mean can that not become that can be
01:47:36.94 --> 01:47:43.02 that's like something you kind of want to put on your wall right just walk yeah so if there's
01:47:43.02 --> 01:47:48.30 something like that hit up Dakota on Twitter and say hey Dakota wouldn't it be cool if there was a
01:47:48.30 --> 01:47:57.58 kind of a canvas that said just walk he might have to put like a request like a section right on his
01:47:57.58 --> 01:48:03.58 website yeah to filter that one out yeah it's true yeah there's some good stuff on there I
01:48:03.58 --> 01:48:08.46 went through it and was like looking at oh this is good man and I'm not really an art see guys
01:48:08.46 --> 01:48:14.06 far as hanging art in the wall you've been in a hotel yeah it's like a picture of like a cabin you
01:48:14.06 --> 01:48:17.50 know and I see what they're doing you're trying to make you feel cozy but it's like this is a
01:48:17.50 --> 01:48:23.66 random picture of it yeah I understand you know but yeah you get that that good one that that we have
01:48:23.66 --> 01:48:27.90 that he has I was like okay I can kind of get down with this even just the looks a lot for sure and
01:48:27.90 --> 01:48:32.46 then you got another layer the good things aesthetically pleasing yeah it was good and there's layers
01:48:32.46 --> 01:48:36.86 and layers exactly right we haven't talked about layers in quite some time you used the layer
01:48:36.86 --> 01:48:44.62 top you did but you know hey Matt probably my fault also psychological warfare if you know what that
01:48:44.62 --> 01:48:50.30 is it's an album with tracks of jockel getting you getting us getting all of us through our moments
01:48:50.30 --> 01:48:57.42 of weakness whatever they may be so check out that one that's unlike Amazon MP3 spot where you get

01:49:39.34 --> 01:49:44.78 look at them it's kind of like legit isn't it yeah yeah yeah it's kind of dope like looking to
01:49:44.78 --> 01:49:48.78 when one like while you're working out with them but what that does it offers this kind of off
01:49:48.78 --> 01:49:53.82 setting like weight to you and to what you're doing and it's yeah it's good especially when
01:49:53.82 --> 01:50:00.54 you change with your my pull ups to change their hard yeah love making my workouts even harder than
01:50:00.54 --> 01:50:04.86 it really is yeah yeah that's how right you go wait use the way like around the eruptions

01:51:13.66 --> 01:51:18.14 extreme ownership first book I wrote with my brother life babbin follow up to that is the dichotomy
01:51:18.14 --> 01:51:22.46 leadership we got echelon front which is leadership consultancy and what we do is work with
01:51:22.46 --> 01:51:29.18 businesses to solve problems through leadership go to echelon front dot com for details we got the
01:51:29.18 --> 01:51:36.78 master coming up May 23rd in 24th in Chicago September 19th in 20th in Denver and December
01:51:36.78 --> 01:51:42.14 4th in 5th in Sydney you came to the master map I did last year and I'm Washington DC I
01:51:42.14 --> 01:51:48.14 really like it I loved it I love going there and thank you and life for inviting me to join you all
01:51:48.14 --> 01:51:55.74 it was awesome to have you there did you relate or did you recognize the leadership lessons
01:51:55.74 --> 01:52:00.94 it's amazing like because you don't think about it too much but you know it's it's different
01:52:00.94 --> 01:52:06.70 terminology but it all means the same and I love how like prioritize an execute and all this stuff
01:52:06.70 --> 01:52:12.46 you know going back to the military side of it and it kind of keeps you back in the fight a little bit
01:52:12.46 --> 01:52:18.94 and so I do go back to work and like this is how you should lead you know you know it's weird too
01:52:18.94 --> 01:52:23.58 I was I always think about leadership it's always in my head and I always think about military stuff
01:52:24.62 --> 01:52:31.26 and actually I was listening to you talk about getting blown up and you were talking about how you
01:52:31.26 --> 01:52:36.70 guys had good dispersion and what that means is your separate from each other that way if something
01:52:36.70 --> 01:52:42.70 blows up or you get hit with a mortar machine gun fire if everyone's too close together then you
01:52:42.70 --> 01:52:47.10 get multiple wounded so you have to you have to have spacing now obviously there's a dichotomy
01:52:47.10 --> 01:52:51.42 because if you have too much spacing then you can't see each other you can't help each other and you
01:52:51.42 --> 01:52:55.82 can't communicate with each other so there's a dichotomy but we used to use this real simple
01:52:55.82 --> 01:53:02.78 corrective statement and it's real simple don't bunch up don't bunch up don't bunch up like
01:53:02.78 --> 01:53:09.42 if you see guys patrolling and they like one guy hits a little bit of an obstacle and so it takes
01:53:09.42 --> 01:53:13.74 a couple extra seconds get over you fast forward that times eight guys and all of a sudden there's
01:53:13.74 --> 01:53:17.58 five guys sitting on the obstacle they're trying to get through it and they guess where the enemy
01:53:17.58 --> 01:53:21.02 puts a landmine they put it by that obstacle because they know you're gonna get blown up
01:53:21.02 --> 01:53:25.66 you're in a gunfight and you see got there's a little piece of cover or sometimes there's not
01:53:25.66 --> 01:53:32.14 even cover but everyone just you get the instincts that if we're closer we're safe you
01:53:32.14 --> 01:53:36.86 yeah and so I would when I was running training I was be saying don't bunch up don't bunch up
01:53:36.86 --> 01:53:42.38 now how does that apply the leadership I can hit me the other day as I was working out as a matter
01:53:42.38 --> 01:53:49.02 fact don't bunch up on leadership what does that mean that means if you're leading echo
01:53:49.82 --> 01:53:53.74 I need to let you lead I don't need to come in there and lead too I don't need to get right up and
01:53:53.74 --> 01:53:58.54 bunch up on you yeah so when someone steps up and takes leadership don't bunch up make
01:53:58.54 --> 01:54:03.74 let him get him some space let him move and follow him and there's nothing wrong with that so
01:54:03.74 --> 01:54:07.42 these things that I learned in the military that Matt learned in the military when you when you look
01:54:07.42 --> 01:54:12.22 at him from a leadership perspective outside the military they still apply so if you want to learn
01:54:12.22 --> 01:54:18.78 about some of that stuff come to the master um extreme ownership dot com for details EF online it
01:54:18.78 --> 01:54:23.82 maybe you can't come to the master maybe you're too busy maybe you don't have that much money right
01:54:23.82 --> 01:54:29.10 maybe you can't get the time off maybe you can't travel that far there's a bunch of reasons and we know that
01:54:30.38 --> 01:54:37.82 and we don't like that we don't so what what we did is we made EF online it is online interactive
01:54:37.82 --> 01:54:44.30 leadership training it's it's me and the rest of the echelon front team showing you teaching you
01:54:44.54 --> 01:54:50.22 about the principles of leadership that we learned in combat and it's available right now if you want
01:54:50.22 --> 01:54:59.26 to go check it out EF online dot com and finally we've got EF Overwatch which is us connecting
01:54:59.26 --> 01:55:06.70 leaders from the military from special operations from combat aviation and we're connecting them
01:55:06.70 --> 01:55:13.34 with companies in the civilian sector that need leaders and this is one thing I've started to say
01:55:14.46 --> 01:55:19.82 is when people people always ask oh I want to hire the right person how do I do it higher
01:55:19.82 --> 01:55:27.58 the leader you want to hire somebody that has experience as a leader you know just because someone is
01:55:27.58 --> 01:55:31.18 good at some technical thing doesn't mean that they're going to be good at leadership it doesn't
01:55:31.18 --> 01:55:37.82 work that way yeah so you it's better to hire somebody that has leadership capability rather than
01:55:37.82 --> 01:55:41.10 and then you take that person that has leadership capability and you teach them what they need to
01:55:41.10 --> 01:55:47.34 know about the industry that you're in so you could have somebody that was in the the special forces
01:55:47.34 --> 01:55:53.58 and you say oh I'm going to hire them to run this communications sales group you just know anything
01:55:53.58 --> 01:55:57.58 about communication sales group I'll tell you what though you give them like a month and a half
01:55:57.58 --> 01:56:02.46 digging in deep you'll learn everything's got to know anything to apply the leadership things that
01:56:02.46 --> 01:56:09.82 he knows from his military service into that position and he's going to win he's going to make it happen
01:56:09.82 --> 01:56:15.50 yeah and what I realize that it's not to be confused with boss like Leah when you say
01:56:15.50 --> 01:56:20.86 people the leadership experience not boss not they won't roll in and be like I'm the boss now since
01:56:20.86 --> 01:56:26.94 I was special forces you know it's not that it's a humble because we're only bringing people in
01:56:26.94 --> 01:56:33.26 through EF through EF over watch we're only bringing people in that understand the principles
01:56:33.26 --> 01:56:37.02 that we talk about next-ream ownership which none of that has to do with being a boss yeah
01:56:37.02 --> 01:56:42.62 I have a thing where I had no in my wife I can understand yes I just want to most of
01:56:42.62 --> 01:56:47.90 knowing things that I can do to her is I'll act like I'm not listening to anyone no one can
01:56:47.90 --> 01:56:54.86 have any influence on me whatsoever and so she had some conference thing that I was supposed to go to
01:56:55.90 --> 01:57:00.78 and she sent me these you know she sent me like hey we're supposed to be there at six o'clock I'm like
01:57:00.78 --> 01:57:07.90 I'll show up when I want to and then my little daughter she always takes my wife side because she has
01:57:07.90 --> 01:57:13.42 a quite figured out my sense of humor yet and so my daughter was like dad you need to do what
01:57:13.42 --> 01:57:18.70 mom says you need to go when you know she said six o'clock and I was like they're not the boss
01:57:20.70 --> 01:57:24.54 so my little daughter was all mad at me for a little while then she realized that was joking now she
01:57:24.54 --> 01:57:32.14 goes dad's not serious yeah dad's not serious he's kidding and now now I've gone too far where you know
01:57:32.14 --> 01:57:40.94 my clean your room she's like I you're just kidding so hey if you want to hang around with us a

02:02:40.78 --> 02:02:48.06 we owe you all a debt of gratitude and to everyone else that's listening I'm going to take a quote
02:02:48.06 --> 02:02:57.26 from Matt Bradford's Twitter and it says this to walk this earth blind is not the same as having
02:02:57.26 --> 02:03:08.14 no vision to walk by faith unchanged by the hand delton is to live life as a visionary and to love
02:03:08.14 --> 02:03:20.70 life as humans were meant seek never settle inspire never complain rise never stay down
02:03:22.06 --> 02:03:31.50 no legs no vision no problem and let's face it if Matt Bradford can do what he does
02:03:31.50 --> 02:03:39.90 if he can keep pushing and keep driving and keep finding new missions and successfully executing
02:03:39.90 --> 02:03:47.66 those missions if he can wake up every day and say no legs no vision no problem if he can have
02:03:47.66 --> 02:03:59.42 the vision he has and the heart that he has then all of us can stop complaining and we can go
02:03:59.42 --> 02:04:09.42 get after it and until next time this is Matt and echo and jockel out
