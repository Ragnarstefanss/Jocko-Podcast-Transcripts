00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.56 This is Jocco podcast number 71.
00:00:05.56 --> 00:00:09.24 With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willink.
00:00:09.24 --> 00:00:11.24 Good evening, echo.
00:00:11.24 --> 00:00:17.36 Good evening.
00:00:17.36 --> 00:00:19.76 A helmet for my pillow.
00:00:19.76 --> 00:00:21.52 A poncho for my bed.
00:00:21.52 --> 00:00:24.72 My rifle rests across my chest.
00:00:24.72 --> 00:00:28.16 The stars swing overhead.
00:00:28.16 --> 00:00:33.16 And to your holes and gun pits, kill them with rifles and knives.
00:00:33.16 --> 00:00:39.28 Feed them with lead until they are dead, and widowed are their wives.
00:00:39.28 --> 00:00:44.000 Sons of the mothers who gave you honor and gift a birth.
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.60 Strike with the knife till blood and life run out upon the earth.
00:00:50.60 --> 00:00:53.72 Marines, keep faith with your glory.
00:00:53.72 --> 00:01:00.72 Keep to your trembling hole in true to your fuel of nip on steel can't penetrate your
00:01:00.72 --> 00:01:02.92 soul.
00:01:02.92 --> 00:01:05.68 Closing they charge all howling.
00:01:05.68 --> 00:01:08.52 Their breasts all targets large.
00:01:08.52 --> 00:01:10.32 The gun must shake.
00:01:10.32 --> 00:01:16.16 The bullets make a slaughter of their charge.
00:01:16.16 --> 00:01:18.68 Red are the flashing tracers.
00:01:18.68 --> 00:01:21.12 Yellow the bursting shells.
00:01:21.12 --> 00:01:24.12 Verses the cry of men who die.
00:01:24.12 --> 00:01:28.96 Shrill are the wounded's yells.
00:01:28.96 --> 00:01:31.96 God how the night real stricken.
00:01:31.96 --> 00:01:34.48 She streaks with orange spark.
00:01:34.48 --> 00:01:38.20 The mortars lash and the cannons crash.
00:01:38.20 --> 00:01:42.08 Have crucified the dark.
00:01:42.08 --> 00:01:44.68 St. Michael Angel of Battle.
00:01:44.68 --> 00:01:47.12 We praise you to God on high.
00:01:47.12 --> 00:01:54.12 The foe you gave was strong and brave and unafraid to die.
00:01:54.12 --> 00:01:59.76 Speak to the Lord for our comrades, killed when the battle seemed lost.
00:01:59.76 --> 00:02:03.28 They went to meet a bright defeat.
00:02:03.28 --> 00:02:06.88 The heroes holocaust.
00:02:06.88 --> 00:02:09.28 Falses the vault of the victor.
00:02:09.28 --> 00:02:11.88 Empty are living pride.
00:02:11.88 --> 00:02:16.52 For those who fell, there is no hell.
00:02:16.52 --> 00:02:23.52 For the brave who died.
00:02:23.52 --> 00:02:33.88 And that's a excerpt from a poem that opens a book called Helmet from My Pillow.
00:02:33.88 --> 00:02:41.08 Then the book was written by a guy named Robert Lecki.
00:02:41.08 --> 00:02:42.60 Otherwise known as Lucky.
00:02:42.60 --> 00:02:45.52 Everybody called him Lucky.
00:02:45.52 --> 00:02:48.92 And he was a machine gunner.
00:02:48.92 --> 00:02:54.52 And then a scout with the first Marine Division in World War II.
00:02:54.52 --> 00:03:03.96 And he's a decent part of the HBO series, the Pacific, which is if you haven't watched
00:03:03.96 --> 00:03:07.20 that, just buy it right now and watch it.
00:03:07.20 --> 00:03:09.80 It's awesome.
00:03:09.80 --> 00:03:13.92 It's based on a bunch of different books and a bunch of different events from the Pacific.
00:03:13.92 --> 00:03:16.20 And a lot of them Eugene Sledge.
00:03:16.20 --> 00:03:18.56 That's another one with the old breed.
00:03:18.56 --> 00:03:20.20 There's a lot that he plays a main role.
00:03:20.20 --> 00:03:26.04 John Basel, plays a large role in that series.
00:03:26.04 --> 00:03:27.80 There's other a bunch of other books.
00:03:27.80 --> 00:03:31.28 We've done a bunch of them on this podcast.
00:03:31.28 --> 00:03:35.44 And this one is another one.
00:03:35.44 --> 00:03:39.68 And I was thinking to myself, like, well, you know, should I do Helmet from my pillow?
00:03:39.68 --> 00:03:41.68 I'd read it a long time ago.
00:03:41.68 --> 00:03:47.20 And I thought to myself, you know, we've kind of covered the Pacific pretty well.
00:03:47.20 --> 00:03:49.000 And I'm just straight up wrong.
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.32 So wrong.
00:03:50.32 --> 00:03:52.000 Because everyone's experience is different.
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.40 There's things that are the same.
00:03:53.40 --> 00:03:59.08 And his viewpoint on things is just a different viewpoint.
00:03:59.08 --> 00:04:07.20 And equally important to understanding not only the war, not only what they experience in
00:04:07.20 --> 00:04:14.32 war, but also a whole other side of human nature that we need to learn about.
00:04:14.32 --> 00:04:18.12 And yeah, there's a lot to go over.
00:04:18.12 --> 00:04:20.24 So a little introduction here.
00:04:20.24 --> 00:04:25.12 And just to give you a little background on Lucky Lucky.
00:04:25.12 --> 00:04:27.64 He enlisted on January 5, 1942.
00:04:27.64 --> 00:04:31.64 He tried to join up the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, but a surgically
00:04:31.64 --> 00:04:35.08 correctable condition disqualified him.
00:04:35.08 --> 00:04:37.76 Now he was back and acceptable.
00:04:37.76 --> 00:04:39.48 Just that tells us a lot.
00:04:39.48 --> 00:04:44.72 He was a civilian, not a professional fighting man.
00:04:44.72 --> 00:04:49.000 But he became a warrior.
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.12 The author was one of those young men.
00:04:52.12 --> 00:05:00.92 Many not yet 20 who were gentle human beings that were transformed by training hardship and
00:05:00.92 --> 00:05:06.04 the war into fighting Marines.
00:05:06.04 --> 00:05:12.08 These were the boys who became men and stood against and then beat back to the world's
00:05:12.08 --> 00:05:16.84 most vicious fighting machines.
00:05:16.84 --> 00:05:23.64 They left behind them a heritage of decency.
00:05:23.64 --> 00:05:27.68 That hopefully will live forever.
00:05:27.68 --> 00:05:32.12 And then that's from the introduction.
00:05:32.12 --> 00:05:41.16 And so again, after World after Pearl Harbor, you've seen pictures.
00:05:41.16 --> 00:05:45.56 Using pictures of guys wrapped around the block, waiting to go to the recruiting office.
00:05:45.56 --> 00:05:47.000 He goes to recruiting office.
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000 He can't go in at first.
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000 Eventually he gets in.
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.88 It takes him a month to get in and then he's off to boot camp.
00:05:52.88 --> 00:05:58.36 And we've seen all kinds of representations and books and movies of Marine Corps boot camp
00:05:58.36 --> 00:06:00.96 and in boot camp, in general.
00:06:00.96 --> 00:06:03.20 But I just had to hit on this one a little bit.
00:06:03.20 --> 00:06:09.20 Because it's just another perspective that shows you, shows you his view of it and gave
00:06:09.20 --> 00:06:14.24 me a, not even a better understanding, a clear understanding of what people are going through
00:06:14.24 --> 00:06:16.92 when they're going through boot camp.
00:06:16.92 --> 00:06:20.96 And I remember actually, I remember this about boot camp.
00:06:20.96 --> 00:06:26.48 I, they, they wrote, we had to write something when I was going through boot camp.
00:06:26.48 --> 00:06:29.28 And I don't know if I've talked about this before, but we were going through boot camp.
00:06:29.28 --> 00:06:32.88 They said, hey, write down, you know, the top three things you're learning.
00:06:32.88 --> 00:06:33.88 Right?
00:06:33.88 --> 00:06:34.88 You had to, we all had to.
00:06:34.88 --> 00:06:37.40 This is Navy boot camp.
00:06:37.40 --> 00:06:44.16 And I wrote down something along the lines of, I wrote something along lines of the
00:06:44.16 --> 00:06:46.52 brainwashing seems very effective.
00:06:46.52 --> 00:06:47.52 Right?
00:06:47.52 --> 00:06:48.88 I'll, I'll do it.
00:06:48.88 --> 00:06:53.000 I was 18, 18, I think I just turned 19.
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.80 And that's, because I was a rebellious kid, right?
00:06:55.80 --> 00:06:57.84 And so I'm thinking they're brainwashing us.
00:06:57.84 --> 00:06:59.04 And I wasn't against it.
00:06:59.04 --> 00:07:00.04 Yeah.
00:07:00.04 --> 00:07:03.24 I, it was kind of one of those statements where I was saying, I was kind of being sarcastic,
00:07:03.24 --> 00:07:04.96 but I was also kind of being true.
00:07:04.96 --> 00:07:05.96 True.
00:07:05.96 --> 00:07:07.52 We call it cracking, but faking.
00:07:07.52 --> 00:07:08.52 Okay.
00:07:08.52 --> 00:07:10.92 We'll roll with that.
00:07:10.92 --> 00:07:13.32 So that's what I was doing.
00:07:13.32 --> 00:07:18.48 And, and I remember, they didn't say anything about anything anyone had written about what
00:07:18.48 --> 00:07:19.72 we were learning or whatever.
00:07:19.72 --> 00:07:21.08 They called that one out.
00:07:21.08 --> 00:07:25.08 The chiefs that were running my boot camp company, they were, you know what I said?
00:07:25.08 --> 00:07:28.08 And if you think you're getting brainwashed, you know what?
00:07:28.08 --> 00:07:30.000 This is what's going to save you and they went on a big thing.
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.48 To counter my, my assessment.
00:07:33.48 --> 00:07:38.52 So there's a little bit of that here in what, what, what, what Lucky said.
00:07:38.52 --> 00:07:42.80 He says the same kind of thing and he gets the same kind of, he gets to the same place.
00:07:42.80 --> 00:07:50.28 But here we go, going to the book, they're at boot camp Marine Corps boot camp in dock.
00:07:50.28 --> 00:07:51.28 And here we go.
00:07:51.28 --> 00:07:55.12 Sergeant Bello marched us to the quarter masters.
00:07:55.12 --> 00:07:56.12 It was there.
00:07:56.12 --> 00:08:00.24 We stripped off all vestiges of personality.
00:08:00.24 --> 00:08:01.56 It is the quarter masters.
00:08:01.56 --> 00:08:05.16 So if you, if you don't know, a quarter master in the military is someone that basically
00:08:05.16 --> 00:08:07.44 runs supply, they give you gear.
00:08:07.44 --> 00:08:08.60 That's what they are.
00:08:08.60 --> 00:08:14.44 So it is the quarter masters who make soldiers, sailors and Marines in their presence
00:08:14.44 --> 00:08:20.72 one strips down with each divestment a trait is lost.
00:08:20.72 --> 00:08:27.80 The discard of a garment marks the quiet death of an idiosyncrasy.
00:08:27.80 --> 00:08:29.96 I take off my socks.
00:08:29.96 --> 00:08:36.08 Gone is a propensity for stripes or clocks or checks or even solids.
00:08:36.08 --> 00:08:41.12 And it is a tendency to combine purple socks with a brown tie.
00:08:41.12 --> 00:08:43.64 My socks, henceforth, will be tan.
00:08:43.64 --> 00:08:49.32 They will neither be soiled nor rolled nor gotty nor restrained nor holy.
00:08:49.32 --> 00:08:51.52 They will be tan.
00:08:51.52 --> 00:08:55.76 The only other thing they may be is clean.
00:08:55.76 --> 00:09:02.86 So it is with it all until one stands naked, struggling with an embarrassment that has
00:09:02.86 --> 00:09:08.38 entirely lost on the leconic shades who work in the quarter master sheds.
00:09:08.38 --> 00:09:14.62 Thus naked, thus quivering, a man is defenseless before the quarter master.
00:09:14.62 --> 00:09:21.54 Character clings to clothes that have gone into the discard as skin and hair stick to adhesive
00:09:21.54 --> 00:09:22.54 tape.
00:09:22.54 --> 00:09:25.10 It is torn from you.
00:09:25.10 --> 00:09:29.66 Then the quarter master shades swarm over you with measuring tape, a cascade of clothes falls
00:09:29.66 --> 00:09:34.26 upon you washing you clean of personality.
00:09:34.26 --> 00:09:38.42 When you have emerged from this, you are but a number.
00:09:38.42 --> 00:09:46.74 Three, five, one, tree, nine or one, United States Marine Corps.
00:09:46.74 --> 00:09:54.82 Twenty minutes before, there had stood in your place a human being surrounded by some 60 other
00:09:54.82 --> 00:09:56.10 human beings.
00:09:56.10 --> 00:10:00.34 And now there is stood one number among 60 others.
00:10:00.34 --> 00:10:03.98 The sum of all to be a training platoon.
00:10:03.98 --> 00:10:10.22 But the parts have no meaning except in the context of the whole.
00:10:10.22 --> 00:10:13.98 So there is little psychological reason why they do that, how they do it.
00:10:13.98 --> 00:10:16.18 And you can see it works.
00:10:16.18 --> 00:10:19.06 You know all those little things that you have, all the little things that make you you,
00:10:19.06 --> 00:10:20.46 we are going to take them away.
00:10:20.46 --> 00:10:22.86 That is what we are going to do.
00:10:22.86 --> 00:10:31.78 And there is so, there is this weird thing because when I went through boot camp, I wanted
00:10:31.78 --> 00:10:33.02 that.
00:10:33.02 --> 00:10:34.18 Take it away from me.
00:10:34.18 --> 00:10:37.46 And I have said this before on the podcast.
00:10:37.46 --> 00:10:38.46 It is a blank slate.
00:10:38.46 --> 00:10:43.50 When you go into boot camp, they shave your head, they take your clothes, they take all
00:10:43.50 --> 00:10:46.58 that personal stuff and you get a blank slate.
00:10:46.58 --> 00:10:49.62 They tell you like this, you need to do to succeed here.
00:10:49.62 --> 00:10:52.82 All that stuff you have done in the past, you are knucklehead, we do not care.
00:10:52.82 --> 00:10:54.82 These are what you got to do now.
00:10:54.82 --> 00:10:56.54 And it is awesome.
00:10:56.54 --> 00:11:02.06 And for a lot of people myself included, you are now, you are becoming part of something
00:11:02.06 --> 00:11:03.06 that is bigger than you.
00:11:03.06 --> 00:11:04.66 That is a good feeling.
00:11:04.66 --> 00:11:07.38 You know, it is a good feeling.
00:11:07.38 --> 00:11:10.10 I liked it.
00:11:10.10 --> 00:11:15.38 I go so far to say, I love it.
00:11:15.38 --> 00:11:16.38 And they do the same thing.
00:11:16.38 --> 00:11:17.58 By the way, they do the same thing to you.
00:11:17.58 --> 00:11:22.74 When you get to your seal training class, your Buds class, you get your head shaved
00:11:22.74 --> 00:11:23.74 again.
00:11:23.74 --> 00:11:26.50 You get another set of uniforms, you are all going to dress the same, you are all going
00:11:26.50 --> 00:11:27.50 to look the same.
00:11:27.50 --> 00:11:30.66 Yeah, I think that head shaving thing would really do it for a lot of people.
00:11:30.66 --> 00:11:31.78 Yeah, yeah, yeah, for sure.
00:11:31.78 --> 00:11:32.78 For sure.
00:11:32.78 --> 00:11:35.78 Just because that is some people's whole personality, you know, they are hair.
00:11:35.78 --> 00:11:36.78 It is like that.
00:11:36.78 --> 00:11:40.78 They like that hair.
00:11:40.78 --> 00:11:44.46 Now of course, fast-forwarding a little bit.
00:11:44.46 --> 00:11:47.62 But I found this interesting back to the book.
00:11:47.62 --> 00:11:53.06 In six weeks of training, they are seemed not to exist a single pattern, apart from meals.
00:11:53.06 --> 00:11:57.98 All seemed chaos, marching drilling in manual arms, listening to lectures on military courtesy,
00:11:57.98 --> 00:12:01.74 and saluting the right hand will strike the head at 45 degree angle midway from the right
00:12:01.74 --> 00:12:02.74 eye.
00:12:02.74 --> 00:12:08.22 Listening to lectures on Marine, jargon from now on, everything floor, street, ground, everything
00:12:08.22 --> 00:12:10.18 is the deck.
00:12:10.18 --> 00:12:14.30 Cleaning and polishing ones rifle until it is shown like an ornament, shaving daily,
00:12:14.30 --> 00:12:16.14 weather, hairy or beardless.
00:12:16.14 --> 00:12:18.30 It was all a jumble.
00:12:18.30 --> 00:12:19.30 What are we going to do?
00:12:19.30 --> 00:12:21.30 Salute the japs to death?
00:12:21.30 --> 00:12:23.86 No, we're going to blind them with spit and polish.
00:12:23.86 --> 00:12:26.58 Yeah, or barber the bastards.
00:12:26.58 --> 00:12:29.10 All the logic seemed to be on our side.
00:12:29.10 --> 00:12:31.42 The Marine Corps seemed a madness.
00:12:31.42 --> 00:12:33.54 So they're thinking, what are we getting out of this?
00:12:33.54 --> 00:12:34.78 You want us to polish?
00:12:34.78 --> 00:12:39.10 How many teachers ought to shoot the rifle?
00:12:39.10 --> 00:12:43.26 Continuing on, it was a madness.
00:12:43.26 --> 00:12:46.10 But it was disciplined.
00:12:46.10 --> 00:12:52.22 Part from us recruits, no one in Paris, island seemed to care for anything but discipline.
00:12:52.22 --> 00:12:54.38 There was absolutely no talk of war.
00:12:54.38 --> 00:13:00.90 We heard no fiery lectures about killing japs, such as we were to hear later on in new river,
00:13:00.90 --> 00:13:02.90 which is the place where they go to train.
00:13:02.90 --> 00:13:04.58 Everything, but discipline.
00:13:04.58 --> 00:13:09.62 Marine Corps discipline was steadfastly mocked and ridiculed.
00:13:09.62 --> 00:13:14.54 Be it holiness or high finance.
00:13:14.54 --> 00:13:19.50 These drill instructors were dedicated Martinets, like the sensualist who feels that if
00:13:19.50 --> 00:13:25.10 a thing cannot be eaten, drunk or taken a bed, it does not exist.
00:13:25.10 --> 00:13:28.10 So were these Martinets in their outlook.
00:13:28.10 --> 00:13:30.14 All was discipline.
00:13:30.14 --> 00:13:32.62 There you go.
00:13:32.62 --> 00:13:37.98 I actually, I thought that word struck me, Martinets.
00:13:37.98 --> 00:13:40.30 So I did a little, you know, I looked it up.
00:13:40.30 --> 00:13:49.54 And the etymology of it is there was a French general that created a certain type of drill,
00:13:49.54 --> 00:13:51.66 close order drill procedures.
00:13:51.66 --> 00:13:54.58 And his name was General Jean Martinette.
00:13:54.58 --> 00:13:55.58 Jean Martinette.
00:13:55.58 --> 00:13:57.82 So that's where he, that's where that word comes from.
00:13:57.82 --> 00:14:00.54 That it means that you're strict, disciplinary.
00:14:00.54 --> 00:14:03.22 Wouldn't it be Martinets?
00:14:03.22 --> 00:14:06.58 Martinets, I guess so, for those that speak French.
00:14:06.58 --> 00:14:08.58 French Canadian background.
00:14:08.58 --> 00:14:11.42 Did not know that was story.
00:14:11.42 --> 00:14:15.02 Oh, that's right, because you were friends with Jodie, you knew him.
00:14:15.02 --> 00:14:16.02 Bonded.
00:14:16.02 --> 00:14:18.02 We bonded over your Canadian roots.
00:14:18.02 --> 00:14:20.02 100%.
00:14:20.02 --> 00:14:22.74 Nice.
00:14:22.74 --> 00:14:28.90 Another great example or great paragraph about what this feels like back to the book.
00:14:28.90 --> 00:14:31.30 It is a process of surrender.
00:14:31.30 --> 00:14:37.30 At every turn, at every hour, it seemed a habit or a preference.
00:14:37.30 --> 00:14:38.86 And it seemed a habit to be given up.
00:14:38.86 --> 00:14:41.02 And adjustment had to be made.
00:14:41.02 --> 00:14:47.90 Even in the mess hall, we learned that nothing mattered so little as a man's own likes
00:14:47.90 --> 00:14:49.90 or dislikes.
00:14:49.90 --> 00:14:52.10 And I think that's what it is.
00:14:52.10 --> 00:14:53.78 That that's what's so cool about.
00:14:53.78 --> 00:14:55.22 That's what I loved.
00:14:55.22 --> 00:14:59.06 Right, when you join the military, it's all stripped away.
00:14:59.06 --> 00:15:03.10 All these little comforts that you have, they stripped them away.
00:15:03.10 --> 00:15:05.54 And you're left with the raw self.
00:15:05.54 --> 00:15:08.06 That's what you're left with.
00:15:08.06 --> 00:15:11.22 And you start putting everything else above yourself.
00:15:11.22 --> 00:15:15.62 It's a very humbling process.
00:15:15.62 --> 00:15:16.62 Back to the book.
00:15:16.62 --> 00:15:22.54 Orst in all this process of surrender was the ruthless refusal to permit a man the slightest
00:15:22.54 --> 00:15:24.42 privacy.
00:15:24.42 --> 00:15:25.98 Everything was done in the open.
00:15:25.98 --> 00:15:31.98 Rising, waking, writing letters, receiving mails, receiving mail, making beds, washing,
00:15:31.98 --> 00:15:38.50 shaving, combing ones hair, emptying ones bowels, all was done in public and shaped to this
00:15:38.50 --> 00:15:43.02 style and structure of the sergeant.
00:15:43.02 --> 00:15:48.14 So that that one right there, going to the bathroom.
00:15:48.14 --> 00:15:52.42 And you get to like in Navy boot camp, the first time you go on the bathroom, there's just
00:15:52.42 --> 00:15:53.42 toilets.
00:15:53.42 --> 00:15:54.42 There's no doors.
00:15:54.42 --> 00:15:55.62 There's no walls.
00:15:55.62 --> 00:15:58.06 Just just 30 toilets in a row.
00:15:58.06 --> 00:15:59.06 A prison style.
00:15:59.06 --> 00:16:00.06 A prison style.
00:16:00.06 --> 00:16:01.06 And you're actually prisons have you only.
00:16:01.06 --> 00:16:02.06 And they're with your little roommate.
00:16:02.06 --> 00:16:03.94 Let even prison style.
00:16:03.94 --> 00:16:08.06 You sit down and by the way, you can't salmon a weight till no one else is in there because
00:16:08.06 --> 00:16:11.14 they give you, you have to go from this to this to this.
00:16:11.14 --> 00:16:12.50 And then okay, we're back in the barracks.
00:16:12.50 --> 00:16:13.74 You can go to the bathroom now.
00:16:13.74 --> 00:16:14.74 So there you go.
00:16:14.74 --> 00:16:19.46 You're going to sit down 18 inches from some other dude.
00:16:19.46 --> 00:16:21.86 That's going to the bathroom.
00:16:21.86 --> 00:16:24.62 That's emptying his bowels.
00:16:24.62 --> 00:16:26.38 And there's no privacy.
00:16:26.38 --> 00:16:34.14 And those, I mean, you may have never taken a crap in front of another human being.
00:16:34.14 --> 00:16:35.14 Most people haven't.
00:16:35.14 --> 00:16:36.42 Why would you?
00:16:36.42 --> 00:16:40.78 So you have this little sanctuary right?
00:16:40.78 --> 00:16:42.54 Where you going to get me private.
00:16:42.54 --> 00:16:43.54 Gone.
00:16:43.54 --> 00:16:44.54 It's gone.
00:16:44.54 --> 00:16:46.26 All exposed.
00:16:46.26 --> 00:16:47.26 Strip the way.
00:16:47.26 --> 00:16:48.26 Yeah.
00:16:48.26 --> 00:16:49.26 It's kind of football is.
00:16:49.26 --> 00:16:50.26 By the way, okay.
00:16:50.26 --> 00:16:53.70 But thing is football, that's kind of like it's cool to do that.
00:16:53.70 --> 00:16:55.74 The coaches don't make you do that.
00:16:55.74 --> 00:17:00.94 It's just like, if you're shy, you know, or that kind of thing, like some guy didn't have
00:17:00.94 --> 00:17:01.94 stalls.
00:17:01.94 --> 00:17:07.26 They did, but yeah, they did, but like the point is like it was kind of like the cool
00:17:07.26 --> 00:17:08.26 culture.
00:17:08.26 --> 00:17:10.26 So guys wouldn't close the stall.
00:17:10.26 --> 00:17:11.26 Oh, okay.
00:17:11.26 --> 00:17:13.34 If there was a shy guy who didn't want to shower, he'd go to his like room
00:17:13.34 --> 00:17:14.34 and shower.
00:17:14.34 --> 00:17:18.26 They'd be like, you know, so it was like the more open and like whatever you were,
00:17:18.26 --> 00:17:20.26 the cooler it kind of was.
00:17:20.26 --> 00:17:21.86 But that's what it did just because if you're shy.
00:17:21.86 --> 00:17:22.86 So if you're shy.
00:17:22.86 --> 00:17:23.86 Yeah.
00:17:23.86 --> 00:17:26.62 It came in shy is like you'd have that feeling, you know.
00:17:26.62 --> 00:17:27.62 Yeah.
00:17:27.62 --> 00:17:28.62 But man, I did it.
00:17:28.62 --> 00:17:36.62 I actually remember that because I had never, I was, whatever I was, 19 years old, sitting
00:17:36.62 --> 00:17:40.18 down next to a dude for the first time, taking a crap.
00:17:40.18 --> 00:17:41.18 I never done that before.
00:17:41.18 --> 00:17:42.18 Why would you do that?
00:17:42.18 --> 00:17:43.18 Yeah.
00:17:43.18 --> 00:17:44.18 No, you have your own little private, or real?
00:17:44.18 --> 00:17:45.18 Do you have your own private space?
00:17:45.18 --> 00:17:46.18 This is my little time.
00:17:46.18 --> 00:17:47.18 As you know, it's not.
00:17:47.18 --> 00:17:48.18 Not your private time.
00:17:48.18 --> 00:17:49.18 Back to the book.
00:17:49.18 --> 00:17:53.42 If you were on Don't, you'd be like, you know, you'd be like, you know, you'd be like,
00:17:53.42 --> 00:17:57.62 on Don in Paris, Island, which is where I'm reading corporate bootcamp is, or one of them,
00:17:57.62 --> 00:18:00.46 there's also one here in Tandy, Eagle.
00:18:00.46 --> 00:18:04.86 If you are on Don in Paris, Island, taking a part in those first few weeks is at the
00:18:04.86 --> 00:18:08.54 rifle range that they start to put you together again.
00:18:08.54 --> 00:18:12.66 So that's, and he goes into some pretty good.
00:18:12.66 --> 00:18:15.94 He talks about now that rebuilding.
00:18:15.94 --> 00:18:21.98 And finally, and again, it's great details, great information, very cool, read, very cool
00:18:21.98 --> 00:18:25.06 perspective.
00:18:25.06 --> 00:18:27.74 That's why you get the book and read it.
00:18:27.74 --> 00:18:28.74 Back to the book.
00:18:28.74 --> 00:18:32.86 In five weeks, they had made us over.
00:18:32.86 --> 00:18:38.30 Another week of training remained, but the desired change already had taken place.
00:18:38.30 --> 00:18:43.42 Most important in this transformation was not the hardening of my flesh, where the sharpening
00:18:43.42 --> 00:18:55.66 of my eyes, but the new attitude of mind, I was a Marine.
00:18:55.66 --> 00:18:59.14 Now that's the big transformation.
00:18:59.14 --> 00:19:03.06 And now like I said, they go, they go to start their advanced training.
00:19:03.06 --> 00:19:07.50 So in bootcamp, you don't, you're not learning, you learn some technical stuff, but you're
00:19:07.50 --> 00:19:09.78 basically just learning a new attitude, right?
00:19:09.78 --> 00:19:14.54 Learning to be a Marine, and then they go from there, they go to a place called New River,
00:19:14.54 --> 00:19:18.54 where they're going to do some more training, and they're going to start learning to
00:19:18.54 --> 00:19:21.14 be actual fighting Marines.
00:19:21.14 --> 00:19:24.90 So here we go back to the book and talk about New River.
00:19:24.90 --> 00:19:33.78 Here, the only talent was that of the foot soldier, the only tool, the handgun, here,
00:19:33.78 --> 00:19:42.02 cultivated the oblique and the delicate, soon-parished, like gardenias and desert.
00:19:42.02 --> 00:19:50.90 So we're starting to get into some hard-living, and they form up into companies and
00:19:50.90 --> 00:19:56.54 hands up in an age company, second battalion, first Marine regiment.
00:19:56.54 --> 00:20:05.10 And they get some other veterans that come to start help them prepare for combat.
00:20:05.10 --> 00:20:07.14 And here's what he says about that.
00:20:07.14 --> 00:20:13.30 The first, and this is the first Marine regiment, the first also received a vital leavening
00:20:13.30 --> 00:20:15.14 of veteran NCOs.
00:20:15.14 --> 00:20:16.14 That's not a commission officer.
00:20:16.14 --> 00:20:21.86 So these are like the mid-level enlisted guys that run the show.
00:20:21.86 --> 00:20:23.06 They would teach us.
00:20:23.06 --> 00:20:27.74 They would train us. They would turn us into fighting troops.
00:20:27.74 --> 00:20:30.66 From them, we would learn our weapons.
00:20:30.66 --> 00:20:35.78 From them, we would take our character and temper.
00:20:35.78 --> 00:20:38.86 They were the old breed.
00:20:38.86 --> 00:20:44.66 And we were the new, the volunteer youths who had come from the comfort of home to the
00:20:44.66 --> 00:20:47.66 hardship of war.
00:20:47.66 --> 00:20:57.10 The next three years, all of these would be my comrades, the men of the first Marine division.
00:20:57.10 --> 00:20:58.50 And that's true.
00:20:58.50 --> 00:21:05.18 They always try and take veterans and they shouldn't say always.
00:21:05.18 --> 00:21:08.06 Because actually in D-Day, they wanted a bunch of new guys.
00:21:08.06 --> 00:21:10.78 They wanted people that hadn't been in combat before.
00:21:10.78 --> 00:21:12.74 But in the SEAL teams, we do that.
00:21:12.74 --> 00:21:15.14 I got back from Ramadi with my task unit.
00:21:15.14 --> 00:21:19.90 We didn't, and they split them up all put them in all different task units.
00:21:19.90 --> 00:21:22.90 So we had all these guys with all the spirits going to these other task units.
00:21:22.90 --> 00:21:25.02 This is pretty normal.
00:21:25.02 --> 00:21:27.06 And that's where the true learning comes from.
00:21:27.06 --> 00:21:31.06 You're going to get that face to face, that hands on.
00:21:31.06 --> 00:21:34.78 And that true connection to what's going on overseas.
00:21:34.78 --> 00:21:40.06 And here's some of the things that they did back to the book, Dr. Gundryl and
00:21:40.06 --> 00:21:46.62 Norman Claycher, know your weapon, know it intimately, know it with almost the insight of
00:21:46.62 --> 00:21:52.46 its inventor, be able to take it apart blindfolded or in the dark to put it together,
00:21:52.46 --> 00:21:56.66 be able to recite mechanically a detailed description of the gun's operation, know the
00:21:56.66 --> 00:22:01.02 part played by every member of the squad from gunner down to the unfortunate who carried
00:22:01.02 --> 00:22:07.26 the water can or the machine gun boxes as well as their own rifles.
00:22:07.26 --> 00:22:15.42 So you're going to learn this weapon like better than better than the inventors what
00:22:15.42 --> 00:22:16.42 they're saying.
00:22:16.42 --> 00:22:17.42 That's how well you need to know it.
00:22:17.42 --> 00:22:18.42 And you know what?
00:22:18.42 --> 00:22:19.42 I believe that.
00:22:19.42 --> 00:22:22.42 That inventor doesn't do what these guys do with that machine gun.
00:22:22.42 --> 00:22:26.46 I'll tell you, if you like the guys that I, the pig gunners we call them, guys that
00:22:26.46 --> 00:22:31.46 carry the mark 48, which is our big heavy weapon, guys that carry that when you watch
00:22:31.46 --> 00:22:33.46 them, it's beautiful.
00:22:33.46 --> 00:22:35.50 It looks the most, it's beautiful.
00:22:35.50 --> 00:22:40.70 So how quick and how fast and how they combat load that thing and hit the ground and clear
00:22:40.70 --> 00:22:44.66 reloads, it was like magic.
00:22:44.66 --> 00:22:47.02 Magic.
00:22:47.02 --> 00:22:50.78 Love that.
00:22:50.78 --> 00:22:54.86 Now there's not just learning about weapons, right?
00:22:54.86 --> 00:22:56.38 There's other things you gotta do.
00:22:56.38 --> 00:22:58.70 You gotta get, you still gotta continue to live a hard life.
00:22:58.70 --> 00:23:03.22 You still gotta get mentally and physically conditioned for combat and what better way to
00:23:03.22 --> 00:23:11.38 do that than some road marches, some road marches, which we've talked about many times here.
00:23:11.38 --> 00:23:16.42 Back to the book, a whole battalion was on the march and my poor squad was tucked away somewhere
00:23:16.42 --> 00:23:19.30 at the center or center rear.
00:23:19.30 --> 00:23:21.50 Clouds have red dust settled upon us.
00:23:21.50 --> 00:23:26.34 My helmet banged irritably against the machine gun that was boring into my shoulder or
00:23:26.34 --> 00:23:32.78 else it was bumped forward, madingly, over my eyes by the movement of my pack.
00:23:32.78 --> 00:23:36.74 My eyes were so out, I dared not drink anymore from my canteen.
00:23:36.74 --> 00:23:40.30 I had no idea how far we had to go.
00:23:40.30 --> 00:23:45.46 My dung agrees were saturated with sweat, their light green darkened by perspiration.
00:23:45.46 --> 00:23:50.90 There had been joking and even some singing the first mile out.
00:23:50.90 --> 00:23:57.66 Now only the bird sang, but for us there was just the foot of feet, the clank of canteens,
00:23:57.66 --> 00:24:03.22 the creak of leather rifle slings, the occasional horse cracking of voice raised and breath
00:24:03.22 --> 00:24:05.90 wasted in a curse.
00:24:05.90 --> 00:24:12.46 Every hour we got a ten minute break, then came the command, often on.
00:24:12.46 --> 00:24:19.22 It means off your behind and on your feet, cursing, hating both command and commandant,
00:24:19.22 --> 00:24:27.62 straining, we rose to our feet and began again the dull plotting rhythm of the march.
00:24:27.62 --> 00:24:33.86 That's the old road march.
00:24:33.86 --> 00:24:40.14 And so they're doing this type of hard training and they're doing maneuvers, they're
00:24:40.14 --> 00:24:45.50 preparing, they're doing mock beach landings, they're doing all those things and they're
00:24:45.50 --> 00:24:47.58 also getting some occasional liberty.
00:24:47.58 --> 00:24:50.58 Do you guys know what you want to liberty is, is a civilian?
00:24:50.58 --> 00:24:55.02 See, it's in word that I throw out there sometimes, it means time off.
00:24:55.02 --> 00:24:58.26 It means time off.
00:24:58.26 --> 00:25:02.06 It's from the Navy, but the Marine Corps uses as well.
00:25:02.06 --> 00:25:03.26 It means time off.
00:25:03.26 --> 00:25:07.46 So these guys, even though they're working hard, when boot camp, you don't get any liberty.
00:25:07.46 --> 00:25:11.34 No, you just stay in boot camp for 13 weeks, you don't get any liberty.
00:25:11.34 --> 00:25:15.90 Once you're a fleet marine or you're in the regular Navy, you get liberty.
00:25:15.90 --> 00:25:18.82 So you can go and do some stuff.
00:25:18.82 --> 00:25:20.34 So these guys are going out and doing stuff.
00:25:20.34 --> 00:25:21.62 What do you think they're doing?
00:25:21.62 --> 00:25:23.02 18 years old.
00:25:23.02 --> 00:25:26.70 And ready to go to war, they're going to go out and get after it.
00:25:26.70 --> 00:25:31.66 In the classic 18 year old sex of the word.
00:25:31.66 --> 00:25:36.10 Actually, that's when I got in that context is how I got turned on to the expression
00:25:36.10 --> 00:25:37.10 get after it.
00:25:37.10 --> 00:25:39.90 Oh, from the context of going out and partying.
00:25:39.90 --> 00:25:40.90 Yes, exactly.
00:25:40.90 --> 00:25:43.78 And I don't know that partying is what we're talking about.
00:25:43.78 --> 00:25:46.86 That's a term that it sounds pretty lame, but that's what we're talking about.
00:25:46.86 --> 00:25:48.74 I think everybody understands that term.
00:25:48.74 --> 00:25:51.34 Drinking, chasing girls, partying.
00:25:51.34 --> 00:25:52.34 That's what we're talking about.
00:25:52.34 --> 00:25:56.66 And I guess it's a commonly used term because you hear people say, like I remember
00:25:56.66 --> 00:26:03.06 seen an article about some school, some college being the number three ranked party school.
00:26:03.06 --> 00:26:07.86 So party implies party doesn't imply birthday cake.
00:26:07.86 --> 00:26:12.86 A party party party implies drinking getting crazy.
00:26:12.86 --> 00:26:13.86 Yeah.
00:26:13.86 --> 00:26:15.06 But which is different.
00:26:15.06 --> 00:26:17.06 Getting crazy is different from getting nuts, right?
00:26:17.06 --> 00:26:18.66 Not getting nuts is fighting.
00:26:18.66 --> 00:26:19.66 Yeah.
00:26:19.66 --> 00:26:20.66 Getting nuts is fighting.
00:26:20.66 --> 00:26:23.50 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:26:23.50 --> 00:26:27.02 All right, so we're just talking about getting crazy and partying.
00:26:27.02 --> 00:26:28.42 And that's what these guys were doing.
00:26:28.42 --> 00:26:29.42 Getting after it.
00:26:29.42 --> 00:26:30.42 Yeah.
00:26:30.42 --> 00:26:31.58 So here we go back to the book.
00:26:31.58 --> 00:26:32.58 We were impatient.
00:26:32.58 --> 00:26:33.78 We were wound up.
00:26:33.78 --> 00:26:36.42 We could know more relaxed than we could think.
00:26:36.42 --> 00:26:40.30 In those days, there was not an introspective person among us.
00:26:40.30 --> 00:26:46.14 We seldom spoke of the war, except as it might relate to ourselves and an abstract
00:26:46.14 --> 00:26:47.14 way.
00:26:47.14 --> 00:26:52.18 The ethics of Hitler, the extermination of the Jews, the yellow peril, these were matters
00:26:52.18 --> 00:26:56.30 for the gentleman of the editorial pages to discuss.
00:26:56.30 --> 00:26:58.30 We lived for thrills.
00:26:58.30 --> 00:27:04.30 Not the thrills of the battlefield, but of the speeding auto, the dimly lighted cafe,
00:27:04.30 --> 00:27:11.86 the drink racing, the blood, the texture of a cheek, the sheen of a silk and calf.
00:27:11.86 --> 00:27:14.02 Nothing was permitted to last.
00:27:14.02 --> 00:27:15.70 All had to be fluid.
00:27:15.70 --> 00:27:21.14 We wanted not actuality, but possibility.
00:27:21.14 --> 00:27:23.02 That's pretty interesting statement.
00:27:23.02 --> 00:27:24.34 We all had to be fluid.
00:27:24.34 --> 00:27:26.70 We wanted not actually, they didn't actually want that.
00:27:26.70 --> 00:27:30.10 They wanted to chase that right.
00:27:30.10 --> 00:27:31.86 We could not be still.
00:27:31.86 --> 00:27:33.98 Always movement, everything changing.
00:27:33.98 --> 00:27:44.02 We were like shadows, fleeing, ever fleeing, condemned men, souls in hell.
00:27:44.02 --> 00:27:50.18 Soon the spate of 62 hour liberties was ended, mid May of 1942, saw me go home for the
00:27:50.18 --> 00:27:51.42 last time.
00:27:51.42 --> 00:28:02.54 My family would not set eyes on me again for nearly three years.
00:28:02.54 --> 00:28:11.94 And again, obviously there's some very important experiences in that section.
00:28:11.94 --> 00:28:15.26 That's why you read the book.
00:28:15.26 --> 00:28:16.94 It's great to hear his perspective.
00:28:16.94 --> 00:28:22.98 You're going to see Robert Lecky, he's a very intelligent.
00:28:22.98 --> 00:28:23.98 He became a writer.
00:28:23.98 --> 00:28:24.98 He became a writer.
00:28:24.98 --> 00:28:25.98 This isn't the only book.
00:28:25.98 --> 00:28:27.74 He wrote 40 plus books in his life.
00:28:27.74 --> 00:28:30.30 He worked for big newspapers.
00:28:30.30 --> 00:28:31.30 He's a writer.
00:28:31.30 --> 00:28:34.50 He's a very smart guy.
00:28:34.50 --> 00:28:37.18 He talks about that and we'll get to that point here.
00:28:37.18 --> 00:28:40.18 That's why his perspective is so interesting.
00:28:40.18 --> 00:28:45.26 He brings a lot of that in this book.
00:28:45.26 --> 00:28:48.82 But eventually, obviously they finished their training.
00:28:48.82 --> 00:28:50.70 No more partying.
00:28:50.70 --> 00:28:54.50 And now it's time to fight.
00:28:54.50 --> 00:28:55.94 Back to the book.
00:28:55.94 --> 00:29:02.74 Fires flickered on the shores of Guadalcanal Island when we came on the deck.
00:29:02.74 --> 00:29:06.74 They were not great flaming, leaping fires and we were disappointed.
00:29:06.74 --> 00:29:10.70 We'd expected to see the world a light when we emerged from the hatches.
00:29:10.70 --> 00:29:12.98 The bombardment had seemed fierce.
00:29:12.98 --> 00:29:20.82 Our modda for such we judged it to be seemed capable of blasting Guadalcanal into
00:29:20.82 --> 00:29:23.10 tradition.
00:29:23.10 --> 00:29:28.74 But in the dirty dawn of August 7th, 1942, there were only a few fires flickering like
00:29:28.74 --> 00:29:33.30 the city dumps to light our path to history.
00:29:33.30 --> 00:29:37.46 We were apprehensive, not frightened.
00:29:37.46 --> 00:29:46.06 So in case you haven't gathered, these guys are about to do the landing at Guadalcanal.
00:29:46.06 --> 00:29:52.34 And they get into the little Higgins boats, the landing craft.
00:29:52.34 --> 00:29:53.34 And here we go.
00:29:53.34 --> 00:29:54.34 The assault began.
00:29:54.34 --> 00:29:55.62 Now I was praying again.
00:29:55.62 --> 00:30:00.26 I had prayed much the night before, carefully, deliberately, in, in, in, in, in, in,
00:30:00.26 --> 00:30:06.26 perpetrating God and the virgin to care for my family and friends should I fall.
00:30:06.26 --> 00:30:10.94 In the vanity of youth, I was positive I would die.
00:30:10.94 --> 00:30:17.62 In the same vanity, I was turning my affairs over to the Almighty.
00:30:17.62 --> 00:30:22.06 And I think what he means by vanity that he was sure he would die, you'd think, oh, somebody
00:30:22.06 --> 00:30:25.10 that's vain, it would be like, hey, I can't be killed.
00:30:25.10 --> 00:30:31.46 But I think what he means by that is the vanity that there's some determined outcome that
00:30:31.46 --> 00:30:37.18 you can control or that there's that there's that there's some way it's going to go.
00:30:37.18 --> 00:30:38.18 Like he's going to die.
00:30:38.18 --> 00:30:39.18 No, you don't even know that.
00:30:39.18 --> 00:30:42.82 Right, right, it's that he knows, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:30:42.82 --> 00:30:43.82 I know what's going to happen.
00:30:43.82 --> 00:30:44.82 I know I'm going to die.
00:30:44.82 --> 00:30:45.98 That's vanity and it's on right.
00:30:45.98 --> 00:30:49.34 That's what he said.
00:30:49.34 --> 00:30:54.26 So they hit the landing back to the book, but there was no fight.
00:30:54.26 --> 00:31:00.66 The Japanese had run from somewhere, came the command, move out.
00:31:00.66 --> 00:31:04.90 We formed staggered squads and slogged off.
00:31:04.90 --> 00:31:08.50 We left our innocence on red beach.
00:31:08.50 --> 00:31:15.46 It would never be the same.
00:31:15.46 --> 00:31:18.26 They spend a night.
00:31:18.26 --> 00:31:22.54 They're they're not patrolling in and in the night.
00:31:22.54 --> 00:31:27.10 They're in security positions and they hear a little gunfire and we're going to the book.
00:31:27.10 --> 00:31:30.42 At dawn, we learned the import of the gunfire.
00:31:30.42 --> 00:31:32.26 Medical corpsman had been killed.
00:31:32.26 --> 00:31:35.18 He had been shot by his own men.
00:31:35.18 --> 00:31:39.90 When the century had challenged him as he returned from relieving himself, he had boggled
00:31:39.90 --> 00:31:43.66 over the past word, little a fusion.
00:31:43.66 --> 00:31:46.26 And so met death.
00:31:46.26 --> 00:31:51.42 It turned to be at the mercy of a liquid continent.
00:31:51.42 --> 00:31:58.30 Now, little heads up, little a fusion is not a good challenge and reply password for everyone.
00:31:58.30 --> 00:32:03.34 You don't want to come up with something that's not totally obvious, but don't make
00:32:03.34 --> 00:32:11.54 a guy that's scared out in the middle of the jungle, remember the word, little a fusion.
00:32:11.54 --> 00:32:12.94 And you know, we talk about blue one blue.
00:32:12.94 --> 00:32:13.94 There you go.
00:32:13.94 --> 00:32:15.14 Like their first casualties, blue one blue.
00:32:15.14 --> 00:32:17.10 Their first casualty is blue one blue.
00:32:17.10 --> 00:32:21.74 Their first casualties are a medic, a corpsman being killed by centuries.
00:32:21.74 --> 00:32:25.02 That's a nightmare.
00:32:25.02 --> 00:32:30.14 And I wasn't going to read this but I'm going to.
00:32:30.14 --> 00:32:31.86 I peered at the captain.
00:32:31.86 --> 00:32:36.42 Anxiety was on his face as though carved there by the night's events.
00:32:36.42 --> 00:32:38.22 It startled me.
00:32:38.22 --> 00:32:41.26 Here was no warrior, no veteran of a hundred battles.
00:32:41.26 --> 00:32:44.10 Here was only a civilian like myself.
00:32:44.10 --> 00:32:48.50 He was a man hardly more confident than the trigger happy century who had killed the
00:32:48.50 --> 00:32:49.82 corpsman.
00:32:49.82 --> 00:32:55.30 He was much older than I, but the responsibility of his charge, the unknown face of war,
00:32:55.30 --> 00:33:00.02 had frightened him past trusting the evidence of his senses.
00:33:00.02 --> 00:33:02.02 So imagine you're going into combat.
00:33:02.02 --> 00:33:03.02 You're in charge.
00:33:03.02 --> 00:33:05.10 You're a civilian, but now you're in charge.
00:33:05.10 --> 00:33:06.66 And you're going out on your first combat patrol.
00:33:06.66 --> 00:33:09.58 You lay up and your first thing you do is you kill one of your own guys kills.
00:33:09.58 --> 00:33:12.10 One of your other guys.
00:33:12.10 --> 00:33:18.94 There's a nightmare and he can see it on his face.
00:33:18.94 --> 00:33:24.46 They spend the rest of the day out there still no heavy enemy contact back to the book.
00:33:24.46 --> 00:33:30.50 That day was a dull lost witness to the cycle of the sun of which I have neither memory,
00:33:30.50 --> 00:33:32.22 nor regret.
00:33:32.22 --> 00:33:34.34 The night I shall never forget.
00:33:34.34 --> 00:33:38.02 I awoke in the middle of it to see the sky on fire.
00:33:38.02 --> 00:33:39.18 So it seemed.
00:33:39.18 --> 00:33:43.94 It was like the red mist of my childhood dream when I imagined judgment to have come,
00:33:43.94 --> 00:33:47.42 while I played baseball on the castle grounds at home.
00:33:47.42 --> 00:33:52.30 We were bathed in red light as though fixed in the eye of Satan.
00:33:52.30 --> 00:33:57.66 Imagine a myriad of red traffic lights glowing in the rain and you will have a replica
00:33:57.66 --> 00:34:00.62 of the world in which I awoke.
00:34:00.62 --> 00:34:03.22 The lights were the flares of the enemy.
00:34:03.22 --> 00:34:08.18 They hung above the jungle roof, swaying gently on their parachutes, casting their red
00:34:08.18 --> 00:34:10.06 glow about.
00:34:10.06 --> 00:34:11.86 Motors throbbed above.
00:34:11.86 --> 00:34:15.26 They were those of Japanese sea planes we learned later.
00:34:15.26 --> 00:34:17.62 We thought they were hunting us.
00:34:17.62 --> 00:34:23.70 But they were actually the eyes of a mighty enemy naval armata that swept into sea
00:34:23.70 --> 00:34:25.70 Clark channel.
00:34:25.70 --> 00:34:31.22 Soon we heard the sound of cannons and the island trembled beneath us.
00:34:31.22 --> 00:34:36.82 There came flashes of light, white and red and great rocking explosions.
00:34:36.82 --> 00:34:42.42 The japs were hammering out one of their greatest naval victories.
00:34:42.42 --> 00:34:44.86 It was the Battle of Savo Island.
00:34:44.86 --> 00:34:50.18 What we learned to call more accurately the Battle of Forests sitting ducks.
00:34:50.18 --> 00:34:52.74 They were sinking three American cruisers.
00:34:52.74 --> 00:35:00.74 The Quincy, Vincent's and Astoria and one Australian cruiser, the Canberra.
00:35:00.74 --> 00:35:08.26 As well as damaging one other American cruiser and a US destroyer.
00:35:08.26 --> 00:35:13.78 And so they then during this they moved towards the beach.
00:35:13.78 --> 00:35:14.78 And here we go.
00:35:14.78 --> 00:35:17.06 It was dusk when we reached the beach.
00:35:17.06 --> 00:35:23.30 We saw wrecked and smoking ships, a clean, unshipped expanse of water between Guadalcanal
00:35:23.30 --> 00:35:25.46 and Florida Island.
00:35:25.46 --> 00:35:28.50 Our navy was gone.
00:35:28.50 --> 00:35:29.50 Gone.
00:35:29.50 --> 00:35:38.74 So, if you don't know anything about the Pacific campaign, you're taking down islands.
00:35:38.74 --> 00:35:41.02 And your lifeline is the navy.
00:35:41.02 --> 00:35:46.90 Because that's who's going to bring you ammunition, food, water, gun support, fire support.
00:35:46.90 --> 00:35:49.10 That's where you're going to take your casualties.
00:35:49.10 --> 00:35:52.94 So you have total reliance on the navy.
00:35:52.94 --> 00:35:56.42 And these guys wake up in the morning and the navy's gone.
00:35:56.42 --> 00:35:59.46 Other than sunken ships.
00:35:59.46 --> 00:36:04.46 And what can they do?
00:36:04.46 --> 00:36:06.46 There's no way to run to.
00:36:06.46 --> 00:36:08.46 You can't back, you can't, there's no way to go.
00:36:08.46 --> 00:36:10.46 The navy's gone.
00:36:10.46 --> 00:36:18.46 So they get ordered to take up position where they think an attack might come from.
00:36:18.46 --> 00:36:20.46 And here we go back to the book.
00:36:20.46 --> 00:36:26.46 We were ordered up from the beach to new positions on the west bank of the Teneru River.
00:36:26.46 --> 00:36:29.66 The orders commanded us to urgency.
00:36:29.66 --> 00:36:33.06 The enemy was expected.
00:36:33.06 --> 00:36:40.02 The Teneru River laid green and evil like a serpent across the pome coastal plain.
00:36:40.02 --> 00:36:44.78 It was called a river, but it was not a river like most of the streams of Oceana.
00:36:44.78 --> 00:36:47.94 It was a creek, not 30 yards wide.
00:36:47.94 --> 00:36:51.34 So they're placed there to set security.
00:36:51.34 --> 00:36:53.50 And they're there for a while.
00:36:53.50 --> 00:36:58.50 And finally, one night, here we go back to the book.
00:36:58.50 --> 00:37:03.94 A man says of the eruption of battle, all hell broke loose.
00:37:03.94 --> 00:37:09.02 The first time he says it, it is true, wonderfully descriptive.
00:37:09.02 --> 00:37:14.18 The millionth time it has said, it has been worn into meaninglessness.
00:37:14.18 --> 00:37:17.06 It has gone the way of all good phrasing.
00:37:17.06 --> 00:37:21.10 It has become cliche.
00:37:21.10 --> 00:37:26.22 But within five minutes of that first machine gun burst of the appearance of that first
00:37:26.22 --> 00:37:31.86 enemy flare that's infused the battlefield in unersely green, greenish light.
00:37:31.86 --> 00:37:38.50 And by its dying, accentuated the re-inveloping night, within five minutes of this, all
00:37:38.50 --> 00:37:41.26 hell broke loose.
00:37:41.26 --> 00:37:44.30 Everyone was firing, every weapon was sounding voice.
00:37:44.30 --> 00:37:50.70 But this was no orchestration, notably beautiful symphony of death, as decadent
00:37:50.70 --> 00:37:52.98 we're echelon observers right.
00:37:52.98 --> 00:37:55.34 Here was a cacophony.
00:37:55.34 --> 00:37:56.78 Here was a cacophony.
00:37:56.78 --> 00:37:58.34 Here was dissonance.
00:37:58.34 --> 00:37:59.94 Here was wildness.
00:37:59.94 --> 00:38:06.38 Here was the absence of rhythm, the loss of limit for fires.
00:38:06.38 --> 00:38:11.42 What when and where he chooses.
00:38:11.42 --> 00:38:18.10 Here was booming, sounding, shrinking, wailing, hissing, crashing, shaking, gibberish
00:38:18.10 --> 00:38:22.46 and noise.
00:38:22.46 --> 00:38:25.10 Here was hell.
00:38:25.10 --> 00:38:31.34 It is odd with what clarity the trained ear distinguishes each one and catalogs it, plucks
00:38:31.34 --> 00:38:37.02 it out of the general den, even though it is intermingled with coincidental with the voice
00:38:37.02 --> 00:38:39.38 of a dozen others.
00:38:39.38 --> 00:38:47.46 Even though one's own machine gun spits and coughs and dances and shakes in caloric fury.
00:38:47.46 --> 00:38:53.70 So it was that our ears prickled at strange new sounds.
00:38:53.70 --> 00:38:59.58 The lighter, shingle-snap and crack of the Japanese rifle, the gargle of their extremely
00:38:59.58 --> 00:39:07.62 fast machine guns, the hiccup of their light mortars.
00:39:07.62 --> 00:39:12.000 And by the way, the movie, the Pacific, or the series, the Pacific, shows the battle
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.02 scenes of the tender we river and their phenomenal.
00:39:15.02 --> 00:39:20.18 They do a great job of representing what he's talking about right there.
00:39:20.18 --> 00:39:23.50 Back to the book, we dive for our holes and gun positions.
00:39:23.50 --> 00:39:30.30 I jump to the gun with which chocolate and eye had left standing on the bank.
00:39:30.30 --> 00:39:35.34 I unclamp the gun and fired, spraying my shots as though I are handling a hose.
00:39:35.34 --> 00:39:36.66 But one fell.
00:39:36.66 --> 00:39:43.06 The first fell, as though his under part had been cut from him by a scythe and the
00:39:43.06 --> 00:39:46.10 others fell tumbling, screaming.
00:39:46.10 --> 00:39:48.94 Once again, our gun collapsed and I grabbed a rifle.
00:39:48.94 --> 00:39:53.22 I remembered had no sling which had been left near the gun.
00:39:53.22 --> 00:39:58.18 The jab, who had survived, who had survived was deep in the coconuts by the time I found
00:39:58.18 --> 00:40:00.66 him in the rifle sites.
00:40:00.66 --> 00:40:06.66 There was his back, bobbing large and he seemed to be throwing his pack away.
00:40:06.66 --> 00:40:10.42 Then I fired and he wasn't there anymore.
00:40:10.42 --> 00:40:15.74 Perhaps it was not eye who shot him, but everyone had found their senses for not everyone
00:40:15.74 --> 00:40:18.38 had found their senses and their weapons by then.
00:40:18.38 --> 00:40:20.50 But I boasted that I had.
00:40:20.50 --> 00:40:26.46 Perhaps too, it was a merciful bullet that pounded him between the shoulder blades for
00:40:26.46 --> 00:40:30.86 he was fleeing to a certain and horrible end.
00:40:30.86 --> 00:40:37.06 Black knights, hunger and slow dissolution in the rain for us.
00:40:37.06 --> 00:40:40.50 But I had not thought of mercy then.
00:40:40.50 --> 00:40:43.06 Modern war went forward in the jungle.
00:40:43.06 --> 00:40:45.46 Men of the first battalion were cleaning up.
00:40:45.46 --> 00:40:48.82 Sometimes they drove a Japanese toward us.
00:40:48.82 --> 00:40:54.94 He would cower on the riverbank, hiding on a wear that opposite him were we.
00:40:54.94 --> 00:41:01.06 Already the victors, numerous heavily armed, lusting for more blood.
00:41:01.06 --> 00:41:04.22 We killed a few more this way.
00:41:04.22 --> 00:41:11.22 The fever was on us.
00:41:11.22 --> 00:41:16.78 Yet it's interesting that he's looking back and thinking to himself that when he kills
00:41:16.78 --> 00:41:21.74 this Japanese soldier, that was a merciful thing to do.
00:41:21.74 --> 00:41:23.74 Because he didn't suffer yet.
00:41:23.74 --> 00:41:26.38 They've been on the island for a few days, even though they're scared, even though
00:41:26.38 --> 00:41:27.38 they've received fire.
00:41:27.38 --> 00:41:32.66 They haven't gone to the full length of suffering that they're going to go through.
00:41:32.66 --> 00:41:39.58 So in the battles over, and leki gives everyone in the book, he just gives them these
00:41:39.58 --> 00:41:46.42 really kind of easy to understand nicknames based on their personality.
00:41:46.42 --> 00:41:52.58 So he talks about this guy here who he calls Lieutenant Ivy League, which doesn't take
00:41:52.58 --> 00:41:55.38 a lot of explanation to picture what that guy is like.
00:41:55.38 --> 00:41:56.70 So here we go back to the book.
00:41:56.70 --> 00:42:00.42 Lieutenant Ivy League strode up to our pits in the morning.
00:42:00.42 --> 00:42:01.70 So this is the battles over.
00:42:01.70 --> 00:42:05.50 He sat on a coconut log and told us what had happened.
00:42:05.50 --> 00:42:10.02 He smoked desperately and stared into the river as he talked.
00:42:10.02 --> 00:42:14.82 The skin around his eyes was drawn tight with strain and with shock.
00:42:14.82 --> 00:42:22.02 His eyes had already taken on that aspect peculiar to Guadalcanal, that constant stare of pupils
00:42:22.02 --> 00:42:27.46 that seemed darker, larger, rounder, more absolute.
00:42:27.46 --> 00:42:33.26 And he kind of gives him a debrief on what happened with the battle that where the Japanese
00:42:33.26 --> 00:42:34.58 had come from.
00:42:34.58 --> 00:42:40.58 And then he says, when he spoke again, it was to tell us who had been killed.
00:42:40.58 --> 00:42:47.90 There were more than a dozen from age company besides more than a score of wounded.
00:42:47.90 --> 00:42:51.46 Four or five of the dead were from our platoon.
00:42:51.46 --> 00:42:54.10 Two of them had been hacked to death.
00:42:54.10 --> 00:43:00.10 A Japanese scouting party had found them asleep in their hole on the riverbank and sliced
00:43:00.10 --> 00:43:04.50 them into pieces.
00:43:04.50 --> 00:43:09.54 Our regimen had killed something like 900 of them.
00:43:09.54 --> 00:43:16.26 Most of them lay in clusters or in heaps before the gun pits commanding the sand spit.
00:43:16.26 --> 00:43:22.06 As though they had not died singly, but in groups.
00:43:22.06 --> 00:43:27.30 One of them reeds went methodically among the dead armed with a pair of pliers.
00:43:27.30 --> 00:43:31.90 He had observed that the Japanese have a penchant for gold fillings in their teeth, often
00:43:31.90 --> 00:43:34.58 for solid gold teeth.
00:43:34.58 --> 00:43:37.78 He was looting their very mouths.
00:43:37.78 --> 00:43:42.94 He would kick their jaws a gap, peer into the mouth with all the solicitude of a park
00:43:42.94 --> 00:43:49.26 avenue dentist, careful, always careful not to contaminate himself by touch.
00:43:49.26 --> 00:43:52.90 And he ain't got all the glittered.
00:43:52.90 --> 00:44:00.38 He kept the gold teeth in an empty bull Durham tobacco sack, which he wore around his neck.
00:44:00.38 --> 00:44:01.38 Souvenirs.
00:44:01.38 --> 00:44:02.38 We called him.
00:44:02.38 --> 00:44:09.10 So that's another nickname he gave, they called this guy Souvenirs.
00:44:09.10 --> 00:44:13.50 Now they're suholing in that position.
00:44:13.50 --> 00:44:17.90 And for a few nights while they were holding this position on the river, they would see
00:44:17.90 --> 00:44:19.70 they didn't know what it was.
00:44:19.70 --> 00:44:23.18 They would see sort of a V in the calm water.
00:44:23.18 --> 00:44:25.94 They would see like a V, a disturbance in the water.
00:44:25.94 --> 00:44:27.26 And they couldn't figure out what it was.
00:44:27.26 --> 00:44:28.42 They were scared out of the couple times.
00:44:28.42 --> 00:44:29.42 They shot towards it.
00:44:29.42 --> 00:44:30.42 They didn't know what it was.
00:44:30.42 --> 00:44:35.98 They thought it was a spire or a scout trying to check them out.
00:44:35.98 --> 00:44:39.62 But they were crocodiles.
00:44:39.62 --> 00:44:40.62 Back to the book.
00:44:40.62 --> 00:44:45.40 I took the glasses from him and focused on the opposite shore where I saw crocodile eating the
00:44:45.40 --> 00:44:48.52 fat Japanese.
00:44:48.52 --> 00:44:53.96 I watched into based fascination, but when the crocodile began to tug at the intestines,
00:44:53.96 --> 00:44:58.48 I recalled my own presence in that very river hardly an hour ago.
00:44:58.48 --> 00:45:03.80 And my knees went weak and I relinquished the glasses.
00:45:03.80 --> 00:45:05.84 That night the V reappared in the river.
00:45:05.84 --> 00:45:09.64 So they could see the little ripple in the river.
00:45:09.64 --> 00:45:11.88 Everyone whooped and hollered.
00:45:11.88 --> 00:45:12.88 No one fired.
00:45:12.88 --> 00:45:14.80 We knew what it was.
00:45:14.80 --> 00:45:15.80 The crocodile.
00:45:15.80 --> 00:45:19.16 Three smaller Vs trailed afterwards.
00:45:19.16 --> 00:45:23.04 And there's even more crocodiles coming.
00:45:23.04 --> 00:45:26.40 They kept us awake, crunching.
00:45:26.40 --> 00:45:28.88 The smell kept us awake.
00:45:28.88 --> 00:45:33.28 Even though we lay with our head swath in a blanket, which was now, which was how we kept
00:45:33.28 --> 00:45:38.24 off the mosquitoes, the smell overpowered us.
00:45:38.24 --> 00:45:45.60 The sense which somehow seems a joke is the one most susceptible to outrage.
00:45:45.60 --> 00:45:48.08 It will give you no rest.
00:45:48.08 --> 00:45:53.88 One can close one's eyes to ugliness or shield the ears from sound, but from a powerful
00:45:53.88 --> 00:45:58.16 smell there is no recourse but flight.
00:45:58.16 --> 00:46:05.28 Then since we could not flee, we could not escape this smell and we could not sleep.
00:46:05.28 --> 00:46:10.32 We never fired at the crocodiles, though they returned to the repost day after day until
00:46:10.32 --> 00:46:16.64 the remains were removed to mass burning and burial, which served as a funeral pyre for
00:46:16.64 --> 00:46:17.88 the enemy.
00:46:17.88 --> 00:46:26.04 We had annihilated.
00:46:26.04 --> 00:46:31.44 Our victory in the fight, which we called the Battle of Hell's Point, was not so great
00:46:31.44 --> 00:46:35.04 as we had imagined it to be.
00:46:35.04 --> 00:46:41.72 It was to be one of the many fights for Guadalcanal, and in the end not the foremost of them.
00:46:41.72 --> 00:46:46.28 But being the first in our experience, we took it for total triumph.
00:46:46.28 --> 00:46:51.36 Like those who take the present for the best of all worlds, having no reference to the
00:46:51.36 --> 00:46:55.32 past, nor regard for the future.
00:46:55.32 --> 00:47:04.48 As a mistake, we all make something good happens and you think you're the victor.
00:47:04.48 --> 00:47:10.16 On the high plateau of triumph, we were about to descend into the depths of trial and
00:47:10.16 --> 00:47:11.16 tedium.
00:47:11.16 --> 00:47:15.64 The Japanese attack was to be redoubled and prolonged and varied.
00:47:15.64 --> 00:47:18.80 They would come from the sky, the sea, and the land.
00:47:18.80 --> 00:47:24.84 In between every trial, there would stretch out the tedium that sucks a man dry drawing
00:47:24.84 --> 00:47:31.40 off the juice from body and soul as a native removes the contents of a stick of sugarcane,
00:47:31.40 --> 00:47:38.000 giving it spent, cracked, good for nothing but the flames.
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:45.24 And there is terror coming from the interaction of trial and tedium.
00:47:45.24 --> 00:47:52.76 The first shaking a man as the wind in the treetops, the second eroding him as the flood
00:47:52.76 --> 00:47:53.76 at the roots.
00:47:53.76 --> 00:47:57.52 So he's got these two things that are working on him.
00:47:57.52 --> 00:48:02.60 The trail, which is the actual fighting, the actual attacks and tedium, which is the boredom
00:48:02.60 --> 00:48:05.48 in the waiting.
00:48:05.48 --> 00:48:11.000 And again, if you watch the Pacific, it does a great job of showing this and one of the things
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.28 that really got me when I watched that for the first time is it shows this landing and
00:48:15.28 --> 00:48:17.48 there's nothing happening.
00:48:17.48 --> 00:48:19.08 Then you're waiting for it to happen.
00:48:19.08 --> 00:48:22.000 Then you know it's going to happen and you're waiting for it.
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.20 And that was a real, that, that, that, that, I remember that feeling.
00:48:27.20 --> 00:48:31.44 Of being in the streets and you're waiting for it to happen and you're just waiting.
00:48:31.44 --> 00:48:34.32 And it's a, you want it to happen.
00:48:34.32 --> 00:48:35.32 Because then you can go.
00:48:35.32 --> 00:48:36.32 Yeah.
00:48:36.32 --> 00:48:37.32 Let's get it over.
00:48:37.32 --> 00:48:38.32 Yeah.
00:48:38.32 --> 00:48:41.52 But here's, he's describing it as like a tree being eroded.
00:48:41.52 --> 00:48:47.44 So the first shaking a man as the wind in the treetops, the second.
00:48:47.44 --> 00:48:51.24 So that's, that's what, that's what the, the actual thing does to you, shakes you around.
00:48:51.24 --> 00:48:57.16 But the tedium, the second, that's the tedium eroding him as the flood.
00:48:57.16 --> 00:48:58.16 At the roots.
00:48:58.16 --> 00:49:04.28 Each fresh trial leaves a man more shaken than the last and each period of tedium with
00:49:04.28 --> 00:49:09.28 its time for speculative dread.
00:49:09.28 --> 00:49:16.44 Leaves his foundations worn lower, his roots less firm for the next trial.
00:49:16.44 --> 00:49:22.76 Sometimes there is a final shattering, a man crouching in a pit beneath the bombardment
00:49:22.76 --> 00:49:30.28 of a battleship might put a pistol to his head and deliver himself.
00:49:30.28 --> 00:49:32.84 Sometimes it is partial.
00:49:32.84 --> 00:49:38.68 Another man might break at the sound of a diving enemy plane and scream and shutter
00:49:38.68 --> 00:49:43.88 and ring his hands and rise to run.
00:49:43.88 --> 00:49:45.96 This is the terror I meant.
00:49:45.96 --> 00:49:52.28 This is the terror that strangles reason with the clawing hands of panic.
00:49:52.28 --> 00:49:53.52 I saw it twice.
00:49:53.52 --> 00:49:57.80 I felt it plucked at me twice, but it was rare.
00:49:57.80 --> 00:50:01.68 It claimed few victims.
00:50:01.68 --> 00:50:08.52 So that's a really, I think that's just a phenomenal way to understand what these guys were
00:50:08.52 --> 00:50:10.52 going through.
00:50:10.52 --> 00:50:16.28 The waiting and then the trial and then the waiting and then the trial.
00:50:16.28 --> 00:50:18.72 And that's a great description.
00:50:18.72 --> 00:50:24.000 The speculative dread, just thinking about, okay, what's the next attack going to be
00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.04 like, are we going to be able to get through it?
00:50:28.04 --> 00:50:30.56 And you know, he's talking about guys killing themselves.
00:50:30.56 --> 00:50:34.60 Being so, they just can't take it anymore.
00:50:34.60 --> 00:50:37.64 They can't take it anymore.
00:50:37.64 --> 00:50:45.64 And the only way out they can figure is to kill themselves, which is just a horrible, horrible
00:50:45.64 --> 00:50:46.64 thing.
00:50:46.64 --> 00:50:48.68 Sometimes criminals will do that.
00:50:48.68 --> 00:50:50.68 Like if they're on a budget if they're on the run.
00:50:50.68 --> 00:50:51.68 True.
00:50:51.68 --> 00:50:56.68 And they're like, when are they going to break down my door and find me and they get that speculative
00:50:56.68 --> 00:50:58.68 dread and they just turn themselves in?
00:50:58.68 --> 00:50:59.68 Right.
00:50:59.68 --> 00:51:03.12 Or I thought you were going to say that sometimes you know, guys want their surrounded
00:51:03.12 --> 00:51:04.12 by the SWAT team.
00:51:04.12 --> 00:51:07.92 Oh yeah, then they just know they just can't take anymore of the guilt themselves.
00:51:07.92 --> 00:51:10.20 Yeah, I feel like that's more of them.
00:51:10.20 --> 00:51:11.92 I'd rather dive and go to jail almost.
00:51:11.92 --> 00:51:12.92 True.
00:51:12.92 --> 00:51:13.92 But speculative dread.
00:51:13.92 --> 00:51:14.92 Are you talking about?
00:51:14.92 --> 00:51:15.92 Yeah.
00:51:15.92 --> 00:51:19.12 Because it's the tournaments, you know, when you're winning around like, oh, and my
00:51:19.12 --> 00:51:21.16 up in my up, that's like, can be part of the chat.
00:51:21.16 --> 00:51:22.16 I mean, waiting.
00:51:22.16 --> 00:51:23.16 Yeah, you're waiting.
00:51:23.16 --> 00:51:24.92 I mean, obviously, we're late harder than this.
00:51:24.92 --> 00:51:26.96 But this.
00:51:26.96 --> 00:51:33.52 And he, so he says this and he says it, it claimed few victims, meaning it didn't actually
00:51:33.52 --> 00:51:35.08 most guys sucked it up.
00:51:35.08 --> 00:51:36.48 And you're going to hear him.
00:51:36.48 --> 00:51:39.08 You know, because he says he felt it twice.
00:51:39.08 --> 00:51:42.92 It plucked at him twice.
00:51:42.92 --> 00:51:45.04 But it wasn't, it was rare.
00:51:45.04 --> 00:51:46.80 He says it, but it was rare.
00:51:46.80 --> 00:51:49.20 And then he says courage was commonplace.
00:51:49.20 --> 00:51:51.32 So that was what was normal.
00:51:51.32 --> 00:51:52.32 It was normal.
00:51:52.32 --> 00:51:54.76 It was courage.
00:51:54.76 --> 00:51:59.12 And this is just such a good paragraph or two here.
00:51:59.12 --> 00:52:01.60 Courage was a commonplace.
00:52:01.60 --> 00:52:08.88 It formed a club or corporation, much as do those other common things upon which men
00:52:08.88 --> 00:52:15.000 for diverse reasons, play so great of value, like money, like charity.
00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:21.44 Courage is in the common on which the exclusive rests.
00:52:21.44 --> 00:52:27.000 Our muddy machine gun pits were transformed into courage clubs.
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.12 When bombs fell or Japanese worships pounded us from the sea.
00:52:32.12 --> 00:52:34.40 It was protocol to be observed too.
00:52:34.40 --> 00:52:41.48 And it was natural that the poor fellow who might break into momentary terror should cause
00:52:41.48 --> 00:52:45.56 pain, silences and embarrassed coughs.
00:52:45.56 --> 00:52:51.24 Everyone looked the other way, like millionaires confronted by the horrifying sight of
00:52:51.24 --> 00:52:56.68 a club member borrowing $5 from the waiter.
00:52:56.68 --> 00:53:02.80 And then he says this, but there was a bit more charity in our clubs, I think.
00:53:02.80 --> 00:53:08.92 We were not quite so puffed up that we could not recognize the ugly thing on our
00:53:08.92 --> 00:53:19.08 friends face as the elder brother of the thing fluttering within our own inwards.
00:53:19.08 --> 00:53:24.88 You today, me tomorrow.
00:53:24.88 --> 00:53:28.68 And that's such a powerful thing to think about.
00:53:28.68 --> 00:53:33.76 When you see someone going through some trouble to be able to recognize like, hey, you
00:53:33.76 --> 00:53:36.60 know, echoes going through some issues right now.
00:53:36.60 --> 00:53:39.12 And I'm not looking down at you.
00:53:39.12 --> 00:53:40.32 I'm not judging you.
00:53:40.32 --> 00:53:45.44 I'm recognizing that what you're going through today could be what I go through tomorrow.
00:53:45.44 --> 00:53:50.80 And they all felt, he felt that, you know, I see echo losing it and curling into a ball
00:53:50.80 --> 00:53:52.68 and not wanting to fight.
00:53:52.68 --> 00:53:57.60 And I recognize that as the older brother of the thing that I actually feel too.
00:53:57.60 --> 00:54:00.20 But I've got it under control today.
00:54:00.20 --> 00:54:01.20 Tomorrow I'm not patrera.
00:54:01.20 --> 00:54:02.20 I got it under control.
00:54:02.20 --> 00:54:05.12 That's why I'm not looking down my nose at you.
00:54:05.12 --> 00:54:06.84 And that's why I'm not judging you.
00:54:06.84 --> 00:54:14.72 And I think that forms such a tight bond that these guys had, you know, these guys had
00:54:14.72 --> 00:54:20.76 respect enough respect and enough mercy on each other to say, look, that goes out
00:54:20.76 --> 00:54:21.76 an hour and a time right now.
00:54:21.76 --> 00:54:22.76 It's okay.
00:54:22.76 --> 00:54:24.16 We're going to get him through today.
00:54:24.16 --> 00:54:27.52 I'm not going to look down on him.
00:54:27.52 --> 00:54:28.80 And tomorrow it might be me.
00:54:28.80 --> 00:54:31.24 And he's not going to look down on me.
00:54:31.24 --> 00:54:32.60 Powerful stuff.
00:54:32.60 --> 00:54:34.24 We tend to judge.
00:54:34.24 --> 00:54:35.24 Yeah, especially.
00:54:35.24 --> 00:54:40.84 Yeah, it seems like they can relate, you know, like echoes at level eight right now.
00:54:40.84 --> 00:54:41.84 He's losing it.
00:54:41.84 --> 00:54:43.60 I'm over at level two.
00:54:43.60 --> 00:54:46.72 And luckily I can keep the two inside, you know.
00:54:46.72 --> 00:54:48.32 But I don't even know when two's going to come out.
00:54:48.32 --> 00:54:49.32 Yes, it was at one.
00:54:49.32 --> 00:54:54.24 So I could very well be it, you know, but that idea that when you're dealing with other
00:54:54.24 --> 00:54:58.20 people, you try and have their perspective.
00:54:58.20 --> 00:55:01.56 You try and take their perspective and understand what they're going through and have
00:55:01.56 --> 00:55:03.92 empathy for what's happening to them.
00:55:03.92 --> 00:55:04.92 Oh, powerful.
00:55:04.92 --> 00:55:05.92 Yeah.
00:55:05.92 --> 00:55:10.92 Instead, we tend so often just to want a judge.
00:55:10.92 --> 00:55:12.92 Yeah.
00:55:12.92 --> 00:55:17.12 Judge.
00:55:17.12 --> 00:55:18.12 Back to the book.
00:55:18.12 --> 00:55:22.92 At night, washing machine Charlie picked up the slack.
00:55:22.92 --> 00:55:28.28 Washing machine Charlie, so named for the sound of his motors, was the nocturnal
00:55:28.28 --> 00:55:31.44 morerger who prowled our skies.
00:55:31.44 --> 00:55:36.08 So these are Japanese bombers.
00:55:36.08 --> 00:55:40.60 Like the dog whose bark is worse than it's bite, the throb of Charlie's motors was more
00:55:40.60 --> 00:55:44.000 fearsome than thump of his bombs.
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:52.000 Charlie did not kill many people, but like McBeth, he murdered sleep.
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:57.12 To these trials was added the worst ordeal, shelling from the sea.
00:55:57.12 --> 00:56:03.60 Many warships usually cruisers, sometimes battleships stand off your coast.
00:56:03.60 --> 00:56:09.12 It is night and you cannot see them nor could you if it were day as their miles and miles
00:56:09.12 --> 00:56:11.04 away.
00:56:11.04 --> 00:56:14.80 We could see the flashes of the guns far out to sea.
00:56:14.80 --> 00:56:20.56 We heard the soft papoon, papoon of their salvos.
00:56:20.56 --> 00:56:28.04 And rushing through the night, straining like an airy box car came the huge projectiles.
00:56:28.04 --> 00:56:32.68 The earth rocks and shakes upon the terrifying crash of the detonation.
00:56:32.68 --> 00:56:38.56 Though it would be hundreds of yards away, your stomach is squeezed as though a monster
00:56:38.56 --> 00:56:43.04 a monster hand were needing it into dough.
00:56:43.04 --> 00:56:47.96 You grab gas for breath like a football player who falls heavily and has the wind knocked
00:56:47.96 --> 00:56:49.52 out of him.
00:56:49.52 --> 00:56:53.04 Flash, papoon.
00:56:53.04 --> 00:56:54.48 They are loing their sights.
00:56:54.48 --> 00:56:55.48 It is coming closer.
00:56:55.48 --> 00:56:56.84 Oh, that one is close.
00:56:56.84 --> 00:56:58.08 The sandbags are falling.
00:56:58.08 --> 00:56:59.08 I can't hear it.
00:56:59.08 --> 00:57:00.08 I can't hear the shell.
00:57:00.08 --> 00:57:01.80 It is the one you don't hear, they say.
00:57:01.80 --> 00:57:03.08 The one you don't hear.
00:57:03.08 --> 00:57:04.08 Where is it?
00:57:04.08 --> 00:57:05.08 Where is it?
00:57:05.08 --> 00:57:06.88 Flash, papoon.
00:57:06.88 --> 00:57:08.44 Thank God.
00:57:08.44 --> 00:57:09.44 It is lifted.
00:57:09.44 --> 00:57:13.04 It is going the other way.
00:57:13.04 --> 00:57:19.48 This day light now and they are only the bombings to worry about and the heat and the mosquitoes.
00:57:19.48 --> 00:57:28.04 And the rice lying in our bellies like stones.
00:57:28.04 --> 00:57:36.80 So again, the unknown and uncontrollable experience of getting hit with mortars or artillery
00:57:36.80 --> 00:57:39.36 in this case, naval gunfire.
00:57:39.36 --> 00:57:41.16 And again, there is no US Navy out there.
00:57:41.16 --> 00:57:42.68 They are just having their way.
00:57:42.68 --> 00:57:47.92 It is a nightmare.
00:57:47.92 --> 00:57:52.28 They continue to press on, but things are not looking good back to the book.
00:57:52.28 --> 00:57:58.000 Everyone kept saying, hopefully, that the Army was coming in next week to relieve us.
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.28 Everyone was in despair.
00:58:00.28 --> 00:58:05.60 We heard that the Army relief force had been destroyed at sea.
00:58:05.60 --> 00:58:08.56 Chocolate and I visited the cemetery.
00:58:08.56 --> 00:58:14.60 It lay to the south off the coastal road that ran from east to west through the coconuts.
00:58:14.60 --> 00:58:18.36 We knelt to prey before the graves of the men we had known.
00:58:18.36 --> 00:58:23.08 Only palm fronds marked the place where they were buried, although here and there were
00:58:23.08 --> 00:58:31.16 rude crosses on which were nailed the men's identification tags.
00:58:31.16 --> 00:58:38.16 Some of the crosses bore mess, gear tins, a fixed to the wood like rude medallions and
00:58:38.16 --> 00:58:43.08 on those the marines had lovingly carved their epitaphs.
00:58:43.08 --> 00:58:47.20 He died fighting.
00:58:47.20 --> 00:58:57.60 A real marine, a big guy with a bigger heart, our buddy.
00:58:57.60 --> 00:59:04.20 The harder the going, the more cheerful he was.
00:59:04.20 --> 00:59:10.36 There was also this verse which I had seen countless times before and since the direct
00:59:10.36 --> 00:59:15.96 and unpolished cry of a marine, sardonic heart.
00:59:15.96 --> 00:59:23.24 When he gets to heaven, so same Peter he will tell one more marine reporting, sir, I've
00:59:23.24 --> 00:59:31.88 served my time in hell.
00:59:31.88 --> 00:59:45.84 Now part of that despair that they felt came from the fact that they began to feel
00:59:45.84 --> 00:59:48.92 expendable.
00:59:48.92 --> 00:59:50.44 Then he goes into that here.
00:59:50.44 --> 00:59:53.80 All armies have expendable items.
00:59:53.80 --> 00:59:58.28 That is a part or unit, the destruction of which will not be fatal to the whole.
00:59:58.28 --> 01:00:03.52 And some more deals a man might consider his finger expendable, but not his hand, or an
01:00:03.52 --> 01:00:07.88 extremity his arm, but not his heart.
01:00:07.88 --> 01:00:12.96 There are expendable items which may be lost or destroyed in the field either in war or
01:00:12.96 --> 01:00:17.96 in peace without their owner being required to replace them.
01:00:17.96 --> 01:00:22.92 A rifle is so expendable or a cartridge belt.
01:00:22.92 --> 01:00:32.000 So are men, men are the most expendable of all hunger, the jungle, the Japanese, not one,
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:40.44 nor all of these could be quite as corrosive as the feeling of expendability.
01:00:40.44 --> 01:00:46.04 This was no feeling of dedication because it was absolutely involuntary.
01:00:46.04 --> 01:00:52.20 I do not doubt that if Marines had asked for volunteers for an impossible campaign such as
01:00:52.20 --> 01:00:57.28 Grotto Canal, almost everyone now fighting would have stepped forward.
01:00:57.28 --> 01:01:01.88 But that is sacrifice, that is voluntary.
01:01:01.88 --> 01:01:14.28 Being expended robs you of that exaltation, the self-abnegation, the absolute freedom of self-sacrifice,
01:01:14.28 --> 01:01:21.20 being expended puts one in the role of victim rather than sacrificeer.
01:01:21.20 --> 01:01:29.52 And there is always something begrudging in this.
01:01:29.52 --> 01:01:39.92 So luckily they do end up getting some help, getting relieved.
01:01:39.92 --> 01:01:43.76 The army shows up to help them out and here we go.
01:01:43.76 --> 01:01:48.20 So we were glad to see the soldiers when they came, trudging up to our pits.
01:01:48.20 --> 01:01:55.44 They came after another air raid, a very close one, but the thing had not infected them yet.
01:01:55.44 --> 01:01:57.56 War was still a lurk.
01:01:57.56 --> 01:02:04.76 Their faces were still heavy with flesh, their ribs padded, their eyes innocent.
01:02:04.76 --> 01:02:10.52 They were older than we, and averaged 25 to our average 20.
01:02:10.52 --> 01:02:17.44 Yet we treated them like children.
01:02:17.44 --> 01:02:23.28 Now even though they get relieved, they're still working and still fighting.
01:02:23.28 --> 01:02:25.88 And they're still suffering.
01:02:25.88 --> 01:02:28.04 Back to the book we were growing irritable.
01:02:28.04 --> 01:02:33.64 Our strength was being steadily sapped and a sort of physical depression afflicted many
01:02:33.64 --> 01:02:35.44 of us.
01:02:35.44 --> 01:02:38.64 The reign, the rainy season was upon us.
01:02:38.64 --> 01:02:42.16 On our exposed ridge, it fell upon us in torrents.
01:02:42.16 --> 01:02:47.32 The man was drenched in seconds, his teeth chattering at his hands darting swiftly to his precious
01:02:47.32 --> 01:02:51.60 cigarettes, transferring them to the safety of his helmet liner, cursing bitterly if he had
01:02:51.60 --> 01:02:56.04 waited too long before becoming conscious of their peril.
01:02:56.04 --> 01:03:00.04 After cigarettes, we were concerned about our ammunition.
01:03:00.04 --> 01:03:04.32 On the downward slope of the hill, the rain water ran into our pits and holes, as though
01:03:04.32 --> 01:03:06.60 they were sewer receivers.
01:03:06.60 --> 01:03:10.88 We had to dash for the pits and lift the boxes of machine gun belts out of the water's
01:03:10.88 --> 01:03:16.64 way, piling them atop on another on the earth and gun platform.
01:03:16.64 --> 01:03:20.28 Any dry place in the pit was reserved for ammunition.
01:03:20.28 --> 01:03:26.24 He who sought refuge from the rain had to sit on the water cans.
01:03:26.24 --> 01:03:31.84 There were whole days of downpour where I lay drenched in shivering, glazing, blankly out
01:03:31.84 --> 01:03:40.08 of my whole, watching as the sheeded gray rain whipped and the undulated over the ridge.
01:03:40.08 --> 01:03:45.04 That such times a man's brain seems to cease to function.
01:03:45.04 --> 01:03:50.60 It seems to retreat into a depth, much as the red core puzzles retreat from the surface
01:03:50.60 --> 01:03:53.88 of the body and times of excitement.
01:03:53.88 --> 01:04:00.000 One ceases to be rational, one becomes only sedentant, like a barnacle, clinging onto
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.40 a ship.
01:04:02.40 --> 01:04:09.44 One is aware only of life, of wetness, of the cold gray rain.
01:04:09.44 --> 01:04:17.08 But without this automatic retreat of reasons, a man can go only one way.
01:04:17.08 --> 01:04:23.24 He can only go mad.
01:04:23.24 --> 01:04:25.60 Sort of level of detachment there.
01:04:25.60 --> 01:04:27.04 Just checking out.
01:04:27.04 --> 01:04:28.04 Just checking out.
01:04:28.04 --> 01:04:31.36 You're just there, but you're not there.
01:04:31.36 --> 01:04:35.20 Good place to visit sometimes.
01:04:35.20 --> 01:04:37.28 You know, I don't think you want to live there.
01:04:37.28 --> 01:04:41.32 You certainly don't want to live there, but it's a good place to visit.
01:04:41.32 --> 01:04:42.32 Why?
01:04:42.32 --> 01:04:48.04 I just think it's important to get to a point where you're just attaching from your physical
01:04:48.04 --> 01:04:49.52 suffering and your physical pain.
01:04:49.52 --> 01:04:51.44 And you just say, you know what?
01:04:51.44 --> 01:04:52.80 I'm just turned off.
01:04:52.80 --> 01:04:57.36 And you just retreat, like he said, you just retreat into almost like nothingness.
01:04:57.36 --> 01:04:59.08 I think it's important.
01:04:59.08 --> 01:05:01.36 I think to gain clarity or something.
01:05:01.36 --> 01:05:03.08 Yeah, I think you gain some clarity.
01:05:03.08 --> 01:05:06.96 And I think it's a very important defense mechanism to have.
01:05:06.96 --> 01:05:07.96 Oh, yeah.
01:05:07.96 --> 01:05:12.12 You know, sometimes when you're doing stuff, you just have to do it.
01:05:12.12 --> 01:05:13.76 Like you can't think about anymore.
01:05:13.76 --> 01:05:16.68 You just have to turn your brain off and go.
01:05:16.68 --> 01:05:19.28 And I think that's what he's talking about right there.
01:05:19.28 --> 01:05:21.96 He's not participating in it.
01:05:21.96 --> 01:05:24.72 He's just attaching from it and doing what he's got to do.
01:05:24.72 --> 01:05:29.92 His body is doing what he's got to do.
01:05:29.92 --> 01:05:39.52 Now, they're this whole time they're expecting to be relieved.
01:05:39.52 --> 01:05:43.60 They're expecting to get pulled off the island.
01:05:43.60 --> 01:05:48.68 And one of the sergeants comes out and makes an announcement to them.
01:05:48.68 --> 01:05:50.44 Stand by to move out in the morning.
01:05:50.44 --> 01:05:56.76 Yeah, we move it out into a new offensive.
01:05:56.76 --> 01:05:59.88 Get all your foul weather gear ready and be sure your guns is oiled.
01:05:59.88 --> 01:06:02.72 Up in the ammunition belts dry.
01:06:02.72 --> 01:06:07.12 Eight Marines will be up to relieve us in the morning.
01:06:07.12 --> 01:06:14.16 So they think they're going to get relieved and go to a ship and relax and get, get into,
01:06:14.16 --> 01:06:15.16 get some relief.
01:06:15.16 --> 01:06:17.20 That's what relieve is, right?
01:06:17.20 --> 01:06:21.52 But they get told, no, you're going on a new offensive.
01:06:21.52 --> 01:06:24.48 So they're in, well, here, going back to the book.
01:06:24.48 --> 01:06:27.48 After nearly five months.
01:06:27.48 --> 01:06:29.88 By the way, a lot of times you think of the island campaigns Japan.
01:06:29.88 --> 01:06:30.88 These are little islands.
01:06:30.88 --> 01:06:32.44 You know, 10 miles long.
01:06:32.44 --> 01:06:37.72 You think all that probably took a week, two weeks, five months.
01:06:37.72 --> 01:06:43.32 After nearly five months, this runner and he's going to name all the different guys
01:06:43.32 --> 01:06:45.40 a different nickname you can hear.
01:06:45.40 --> 01:06:47.24 Runner had malaria.
01:06:47.24 --> 01:06:50.28 Brick barely stirred from the pit except at night.
01:06:50.28 --> 01:06:54.04 Who's your an oak stump or subject to long periods of depression?
01:06:54.04 --> 01:06:59.80 Head and long since left us, I had dysentery, chocolate was irritable.
01:06:59.80 --> 01:07:04.80 All of us were initiated and weakened beyond measure.
01:07:04.80 --> 01:07:07.72 But we were to move out on the attack.
01:07:07.72 --> 01:07:15.28 We could not move the chow without gasping for breath, but we were to move on the enemy.
01:07:15.28 --> 01:07:17.24 We disperseed.
01:07:17.24 --> 01:07:21.76 In the morning, we crouched by our guns and waited for the order to dismantle them and
01:07:21.76 --> 01:07:24.48 move out.
01:07:24.48 --> 01:07:26.60 It did not come.
01:07:26.60 --> 01:07:31.84 Norded to come the next day or the next and hope came creeping back blushing, ashamed
01:07:31.84 --> 01:07:37.88 of her loyal, disloyal flight, but commending herself to us once more with the promise
01:07:37.88 --> 01:07:42.72 never again to desert the ramparts.
01:07:42.72 --> 01:07:46.76 Then one morning, the word came to move out.
01:07:46.76 --> 01:07:49.76 Sergeant Dandy gave it to us.
01:07:49.76 --> 01:07:55.48 Heaf the guns behind, he said, take only your rifles and foul weather geared.
01:07:55.48 --> 01:07:56.72 He grinned.
01:07:56.72 --> 01:07:58.24 We're being relieved.
01:07:58.24 --> 01:08:02.24 He was December 14, 1942.
01:08:02.24 --> 01:08:08.08 We had been on the lines without relief since August 7th.
01:08:08.08 --> 01:08:13.96 My battalion, the second battalion, first regiment, was the last of those in the first
01:08:13.96 --> 01:08:18.08 marine division to come out of the lines.
01:08:18.08 --> 01:08:21.08 The battle canal was over.
01:08:21.08 --> 01:08:25.08 We had won.
01:08:25.08 --> 01:08:34.56 And next, they get pulled back off the island now and he's climbing aboard the ship of the
01:08:34.56 --> 01:08:37.76 board cargo nets.
01:08:37.76 --> 01:08:38.76 He's exhausted.
01:08:38.76 --> 01:08:41.92 I was able to reach the top of the net but go no further.
01:08:41.92 --> 01:08:47.48 I could not muster the strength to swing over the gunnel and I hung there breathing heavily.
01:08:47.48 --> 01:08:50.92 The ship's hot side swaying away from me in the swells.
01:08:50.92 --> 01:08:55.40 The very predition, lapping beneath me until two sailors grabbed me out of the armpits
01:08:55.40 --> 01:08:57.32 and pulled me over.
01:08:57.32 --> 01:09:01.64 I fell with a clatter among the others who had been so brought aboard and I lay with
01:09:01.64 --> 01:09:07.24 my cheek pressed against the warm, grimy deck, my heart beating rapidly, not from this
01:09:07.24 --> 01:09:10.000 exercise.
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.24 But from happiness.
01:09:14.24 --> 01:09:20.24 He ends up having a sailor, a conversation, him and his buddy Chockler, who's like one of his
01:09:20.24 --> 01:09:28.80 best friends, they are end up having a conversation with one of the sailors.
01:09:28.80 --> 01:09:30.92 And he says the soldier seems to be surprised.
01:09:30.92 --> 01:09:32.88 He says, you mean Guadalcanal.
01:09:32.88 --> 01:09:35.56 He says, was it rough?
01:09:35.56 --> 01:09:36.40 How was it?
01:09:36.40 --> 01:09:38.28 Rough?
01:09:38.28 --> 01:09:40.32 Rough we answered mechanically.
01:09:40.32 --> 01:09:41.32 Then Chockler spoke up.
01:09:41.32 --> 01:09:44.64 You mean Guadalcanal?
01:09:44.64 --> 01:09:46.04 The soldier seemed surprised.
01:09:46.04 --> 01:09:51.16 The conversation with the soldier that was on the ship that hadn't been in Guadalcanal.
01:09:51.16 --> 01:09:52.32 The soldier seemed surprised.
01:09:52.32 --> 01:09:53.96 Of course I do.
01:09:53.96 --> 01:09:55.56 Chockler hastened to explain.
01:09:55.56 --> 01:09:56.56 I wasn't being wise.
01:09:56.56 --> 01:10:00.92 I meant, had you ever heard of the place before you got here?
01:10:00.92 --> 01:10:03.12 He's astonishment startled us.
01:10:03.12 --> 01:10:05.68 An idea was dawning.
01:10:05.68 --> 01:10:11.28 You mean, how, yes, Guadalcanal, the first Marines, everybody's hurt.
01:10:11.28 --> 01:10:14.04 You guys are famous.
01:10:14.04 --> 01:10:17.28 You guys are heroes back home.
01:10:17.28 --> 01:10:21.88 We did not see him leave for we had both looked away quickly.
01:10:21.88 --> 01:10:25.20 Each embarrassed by the quick tears.
01:10:25.20 --> 01:10:29.40 They had not forgotten.
01:10:29.40 --> 01:10:35.20 And again, I kind of breeze through that park in the book.
01:10:35.20 --> 01:10:38.64 But a lot of times when they were in those moments of despair, they'd be thinking, no
01:10:38.64 --> 01:10:40.08 one knows what's going on here.
01:10:40.08 --> 01:10:41.60 They don't know how bad it is.
01:10:41.60 --> 01:10:45.88 But the reality was this war, this battle that lasted five months.
01:10:45.88 --> 01:10:51.20 There was all kinds of reporting in the glory of the Marines and what they were doing.
01:10:51.20 --> 01:10:56.16 And so they were, I guess, you know, they were just overwhelmed with the fact that this
01:10:56.16 --> 01:10:58.72 soldier said, you guys, are you kidding me?
01:10:58.72 --> 01:11:02.40 Guadalcanal, this is it.
01:11:02.40 --> 01:11:12.72 Now after they leave Guadalcanal, they get some much needed R&R.
01:11:12.72 --> 01:11:16.12 Rest in relaxation, they get to go to Australia, you did do this.
01:11:16.12 --> 01:11:21.12 And they, they go into the book.
01:11:21.12 --> 01:11:27.12 Of all the regiments ours, the first was in the most advantageous position for the great
01:11:27.12 --> 01:11:29.88 debauch.
01:11:29.88 --> 01:11:30.88 Discipline.
01:11:30.88 --> 01:11:38.04 Already dissolved in the delicious squeals of the girls all but disappeared that night.
01:11:38.04 --> 01:11:43.88 We received part of our six months of Rears of Spain in Australian pounds.
01:11:43.88 --> 01:11:45.88 But we were issued no clothing.
01:11:45.88 --> 01:11:48.28 We still wore our disheveled dungaries.
01:11:48.28 --> 01:11:53.000 So you can imagine these guys are coming off of Guadalcanal, hell.
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000 And now they're rolling into Australia.
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.48 And they describe it here.
01:11:56.48 --> 01:11:58.04 Girls are waiting for them.
01:11:58.04 --> 01:12:00.44 These are the heroes of Guadalcanal.
01:12:00.44 --> 01:12:06.68 So they roll in and they get after it in the way that we talked about earlier.
01:12:06.68 --> 01:12:12.68 They start just, they're going crazy.
01:12:12.68 --> 01:12:21.52 And this is one of the things I loved about this book is that Robert Lecky is so real.
01:12:21.52 --> 01:12:22.52 He's so real.
01:12:22.52 --> 01:12:25.000 He's just a, he's just real.
01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.36 And guess what he likes to do?
01:12:27.36 --> 01:12:28.84 He likes to get after it.
01:12:28.84 --> 01:12:29.96 He goes out.
01:12:29.96 --> 01:12:30.96 He drinks.
01:12:30.96 --> 01:12:31.96 They drink.
01:12:31.96 --> 01:12:32.96 They chase women.
01:12:32.96 --> 01:12:34.96 He goes hard.
01:12:34.96 --> 01:12:40.84 And he ends up getting into some trouble.
01:12:40.84 --> 01:12:44.12 And he talks about brig rats.
01:12:44.12 --> 01:12:48.44 Basically, guys that have been thrown in the brig, which is, which is the military jail.
01:12:48.44 --> 01:12:52.16 And on a ship, they actually have a little brig, you know, a little jail room.
01:12:52.16 --> 01:12:54.60 And you can get thrown in there.
01:12:54.60 --> 01:12:59.08 And so we talked a little bit about that.
01:12:59.08 --> 01:13:03.32 It is most especially a marine sediment sentiment.
01:13:03.32 --> 01:13:10.24 And when analyzed, it turns out to be not shameless or shocking, but merely this.
01:13:10.24 --> 01:13:16.36 A man who lands in the brig is apt to be a man of bold spirit and independent mind who
01:13:16.36 --> 01:13:22.92 must occasionally rebel against the harsh and unrelenting discipline of the camp.
01:13:22.92 --> 01:13:26.36 I am not attempting to exalt what should be condemned.
01:13:26.36 --> 01:13:31.36 I'm not suggesting that because of their boldness or independence, the brig rats be
01:13:31.36 --> 01:13:34.76 forgiven and escape punishment.
01:13:34.76 --> 01:13:38.60 Brig'd they must be, and brig'd they were.
01:13:38.60 --> 01:13:43.08 Nor am I speaking of the habitual brig rat.
01:13:43.08 --> 01:13:49.60 The steady maligner, who, the good for nothing, who is more often in the brig than out of
01:13:49.60 --> 01:13:55.76 it, and who seeks to avoid every consequence of his uniform, even fighting.
01:13:55.76 --> 01:14:01.48 I speak of the young, high-hearted soldier whose very nature is bound to bring him into conflict
01:14:01.48 --> 01:14:07.84 with military discipline and to land him, unless he is exceptionally lucky in the brig.
01:14:07.84 --> 01:14:13.28 I speak of chocolate and chicken and oak stump and a dozen others.
01:14:13.28 --> 01:14:16.80 And of course of myself.
01:14:16.80 --> 01:14:22.28 So he's saying, look, you guys that are high-spirited go-getters, and they're going to get
01:14:22.28 --> 01:14:26.20 after it on the battlefield, and they're going to get after it on the liberty, and sometimes
01:14:26.20 --> 01:14:29.12 they're going to get rolled up unless they're super lucky, and that doesn't make
01:14:29.12 --> 01:14:30.12 them bad people.
01:14:30.12 --> 01:14:34.68 And I had one of my buddies getting really big trouble.
01:14:34.68 --> 01:14:38.52 This is when we were young guys.
01:14:38.52 --> 01:14:41.96 Back in the day, back in the day, one of my bros.
01:14:41.96 --> 01:14:47.44 He got in big trouble, and I thought that our officer, who's one of the best officers
01:14:47.44 --> 01:14:52.52 I ever worked for, I thought he was going to really, you know, just crush him and I thought
01:14:52.52 --> 01:14:55.32 he's going to be really disappointed in all these horrible things.
01:14:55.32 --> 01:14:56.32 And this is a guy.
01:14:56.32 --> 01:14:59.92 The officers of the guy that we all loved and wanted to always impress, and we wanted
01:14:59.92 --> 01:15:00.92 to do a good job for him.
01:15:00.92 --> 01:15:05.40 And so when my buddy had this big incident that he did, which, you know, he was drunk and
01:15:05.40 --> 01:15:10.56 got crazy and, you know, got arrested and all that, all that bad stuff.
01:15:10.56 --> 01:15:16.92 And I talked to our OIC about it in a today's, or you know, is, I mean, what's going to
01:15:16.92 --> 01:15:20.08 happen with my buddy.
01:15:20.08 --> 01:15:25.64 And the officer goes, hey, you guys are young warriors and things like this are going
01:15:25.64 --> 01:15:26.64 to happen.
01:15:26.64 --> 01:15:29.24 Don't let him happen much, but they're going to happen.
01:15:29.24 --> 01:15:30.52 And we'll deal with it.
01:15:30.52 --> 01:15:31.84 And I'll send myself.
01:15:31.84 --> 01:15:35.60 I don't know why I love this guy so much, but that's exactly it.
01:15:35.60 --> 01:15:42.16 You know, he was he knew that that, you know, you had young, ram-bunks, just guys full
01:15:42.16 --> 01:15:48.36 of testosterone and then you add alcohol into the equation and you add chaos into the
01:15:48.36 --> 01:15:51.20 equation, because some guys might control again.
01:15:51.20 --> 01:15:56.000 I hate to, to give that credence to this type of stuff.
01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.40 Because when I look back, I wish I would have been a better leader.
01:15:58.40 --> 01:16:03.96 I wish I would have been doing other things, you know, but if you're in a leadership position
01:16:03.96 --> 01:16:07.44 and you've got guys like this and you can demo instead of trying to help them, you're
01:16:07.44 --> 01:16:08.44 not helping them.
01:16:08.44 --> 01:16:10.76 It's goes back to this judgment thing that we talked about earlier.
01:16:10.76 --> 01:16:16.84 If I'm looking at you saying, oh, you don't, you don't, you got in trouble.
01:16:16.84 --> 01:16:18.04 You're a bad person.
01:16:18.04 --> 01:16:19.88 I don't want you on this team.
01:16:19.88 --> 01:16:23.20 Instead of saying, hey, look, we got to get you on a control.
01:16:23.20 --> 01:16:24.68 You got the right attitude.
01:16:24.68 --> 01:16:25.68 You got the lot of energy.
01:16:25.68 --> 01:16:26.92 Let's focus it on somewhere.
01:16:26.92 --> 01:16:27.92 Correct.
01:16:27.92 --> 01:16:29.76 Let's focus it on something good.
01:16:29.76 --> 01:16:33.48 Let's get you doing something positive instead of doing something negative.
01:16:33.48 --> 01:16:36.56 Instead, sometimes guys go into the judgmental mode.
01:16:36.56 --> 01:16:39.52 You know, I'm just going to judge you and oh, you got in trouble.
01:16:39.52 --> 01:16:40.52 So you're bad.
01:16:40.52 --> 01:16:42.000 That's the wrong attitude, Dave.
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.12 How about you got in trouble?
01:16:43.12 --> 01:16:44.28 How about me is the leader.
01:16:44.28 --> 01:16:46.04 I let you down.
01:16:46.04 --> 01:16:48.96 I didn't show you the right way to expend your energy.
01:16:48.96 --> 01:16:54.08 I didn't give you the opportunity to give you an outlet for this, this aggression that
01:16:54.08 --> 01:16:55.08 you have.
01:16:55.08 --> 01:16:57.72 Because you, aggression you're going to have.
01:16:57.72 --> 01:16:59.48 That means fighting.
01:16:59.48 --> 01:17:00.48 You don't think you get up.
01:17:00.48 --> 01:17:02.92 You get a guy that are in the military.
01:17:02.92 --> 01:17:04.72 Do you want someone in your platoon?
01:17:04.72 --> 01:17:06.96 Do you want them to be not aggressive?
01:17:06.96 --> 01:17:07.96 Of course you want.
01:17:07.96 --> 01:17:10.16 I want the most aggressive bastard you can imagine.
01:17:10.16 --> 01:17:11.16 And guess what?
01:17:11.16 --> 01:17:14.04 If you don't give them to something to do with that aggression, they're going to find something
01:17:14.04 --> 01:17:15.04 to do with it.
01:17:15.04 --> 01:17:16.60 And it's not going to be good.
01:17:16.60 --> 01:17:20.32 So as a leader, let's find something positive that they can do with their aggression.
01:17:20.32 --> 01:17:22.88 Yeah, it's not like he's out there.
01:17:22.88 --> 01:17:24.68 Not like it's known.
01:17:24.68 --> 01:17:29.60 Like in your case, you thought he was going to get severely punished.
01:17:29.60 --> 01:17:30.60 Correct.
01:17:30.60 --> 01:17:32.48 It's not like he's out there publicly saying,
01:17:32.48 --> 01:17:33.48 hey, that's cool.
01:17:33.48 --> 01:17:34.48 Dude, what you got to do?
01:17:34.48 --> 01:17:35.48 Play.
01:17:35.48 --> 01:17:36.48 You're right.
01:17:36.48 --> 01:17:38.64 But when it happened, yeah, it's like.
01:17:38.64 --> 01:17:44.48 And I think truly that officer who is a great guy, he truly probably felt exactly what
01:17:44.48 --> 01:17:48.32 I just said, I should have given them a better outlet for this aggression.
01:17:48.32 --> 01:17:52.40 You know, I should have let I should have figured something better out for them to do.
01:17:52.40 --> 01:17:54.36 We got to do something.
01:17:54.36 --> 01:17:57.28 You give us idle hands and pockets full of money.
01:17:57.28 --> 01:18:01.72 Can you imagine these guys are getting six months pay and they were the richest guys
01:18:01.72 --> 01:18:02.72 in the world.
01:18:02.72 --> 01:18:03.72 I guarantee it.
01:18:03.72 --> 01:18:06.72 You know, especially rolling into wartime Australia.
01:18:06.72 --> 01:18:12.000 I mean, you know how stringent they were with with the restricting the money that people
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.32 were using and spending all over the world to save money for the war.
01:18:15.32 --> 01:18:16.32 And here come these guys in.
01:18:16.32 --> 01:18:17.64 Richest guys ever.
01:18:17.64 --> 01:18:19.92 Heroes of Wall of Canal.
01:18:19.92 --> 01:18:22.24 I think they're going to get after it.
01:18:22.24 --> 01:18:24.48 They're going to get after it.
01:18:24.48 --> 01:18:27.20 So as leaders, what we need to do is give them a proper outlet.
01:18:27.20 --> 01:18:28.20 Right.
01:18:28.20 --> 01:18:29.20 Because those guys want to get after it.
01:18:29.20 --> 01:18:30.20 But you've got to give them the right way.
01:18:30.20 --> 01:18:31.20 Yeah.
01:18:31.20 --> 01:18:33.60 You know, you've got to give them something positive that they can work on.
01:18:33.60 --> 01:18:37.80 And if you're going to let them do something negative, then let's put some barriers around
01:18:37.80 --> 01:18:42.08 them so they don't get into trouble.
01:18:42.08 --> 01:18:46.60 Wish I would have known this when I was a when I was coming up.
01:18:46.60 --> 01:18:50.60 I would have done more positive stuff and said a more negative stuff.
01:18:50.60 --> 01:18:55.20 So now we get into the trouble piece.
01:18:55.20 --> 01:18:58.68 And these, he's got so many great stories about how these guys, what these guys were going
01:18:58.68 --> 01:19:00.20 through.
01:19:00.20 --> 01:19:02.64 And this, so they're out.
01:19:02.64 --> 01:19:04.32 He's out drinking.
01:19:04.32 --> 01:19:09.44 And one of his buddies, guy that I mentioned before, his name is Chuckler, Chuckler is actually
01:19:09.44 --> 01:19:10.44 on duty.
01:19:10.44 --> 01:19:12.92 So he's standing duty, which means he's uniform.
01:19:12.92 --> 01:19:13.92 He's not allowed to drink.
01:19:13.92 --> 01:19:19.68 He's watching and he's being, you know, he's on duty.
01:19:19.68 --> 01:19:20.84 And so here we go.
01:19:20.84 --> 01:19:25.64 I found Chuckler standing glumly outside the Slop Shoot entrance.
01:19:25.64 --> 01:19:31.000 He'd hope for the interior guard where he might sneak a beer or two.
01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.20 I'll get you one, I promised.
01:19:33.20 --> 01:19:40.28 I returned with a big glass out of which Chuckler might take a surpetitious sip.
01:19:40.28 --> 01:19:42.48 There were more side elves.
01:19:42.48 --> 01:19:45.12 Until Chuckler said, I got to go to the head.
01:19:45.12 --> 01:19:47.40 Here cover for me.
01:19:47.40 --> 01:19:50.88 He gave me his pistol belt and helmet and made off.
01:19:50.88 --> 01:19:52.56 So now, let these drunk right now.
01:19:52.56 --> 01:19:58.000 Okay, so.
01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:03.04 But Chuckler says, hey man, I'm going to take a piss here, take my helmet, take my pistol,
01:20:03.04 --> 01:20:05.84 cover for me.
01:20:05.84 --> 01:20:10.32 For a century to be drunk and then to desert as post and surrender as a weapon is to
01:20:10.32 --> 01:20:15.12 combine Cardinal Sin with unforgivable offense.
01:20:15.12 --> 01:20:19.08 I was anxiously hoping that he would hurry back.
01:20:19.08 --> 01:20:22.72 But then an unfortunate thing happened.
01:20:22.72 --> 01:20:26.76 Lieutenant Ivy League came striding down the corridor.
01:20:26.76 --> 01:20:31.20 I say it was unfortunate because Ivy League was the officer of the day.
01:20:31.20 --> 01:20:36.84 More than that, he was still the man who had philched my cigars, the enlisted men's cigars
01:20:36.84 --> 01:20:37.84 if he will.
01:20:37.84 --> 01:20:44.08 So at one point he had gotten hold of some cigars and this officer had taken him.
01:20:44.08 --> 01:20:54.08 And by the way, also Robert Lecky, he's an Irishman and I'm not going to make a generalization.
01:20:54.08 --> 01:20:59.52 Okay, yes, he's a hot tempered Irishman.
01:20:59.52 --> 01:21:03.000 And so he sees this guy and then he's drunk.
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.80 He just got off the gullalacanel and here's what happens.
01:21:06.80 --> 01:21:07.80 Back to the book.
01:21:07.80 --> 01:21:12.64 My anger was nourished by the alcohol within me and I drew Chuckler's pistol and pointed
01:21:12.64 --> 01:21:15.36 at him and said, stop where you are.
01:21:15.36 --> 01:21:25.36 You lousy cigar stealing son of a bitch or I'll blow your gentleman's ass off.
01:21:25.36 --> 01:21:28.56 So not, not good.
01:21:28.56 --> 01:21:37.000 And he ends up getting in pretty significant trouble.
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.40 And he actually gets bread and water.
01:21:39.40 --> 01:21:40.88 Which they still do that in the military.
01:21:40.88 --> 01:21:42.40 They get bread and water.
01:21:42.40 --> 01:21:44.64 You can get he gets bread and water for five days.
01:21:44.64 --> 01:21:46.48 So in the break, bread and water for five days.
01:21:46.48 --> 01:21:50.08 That's the punishment that he gets and he gets docked pay and he gets busted down and
01:21:50.08 --> 01:21:52.08 wreck.
01:21:52.08 --> 01:22:00.68 One time I was on a ship deployed, broken a jury and we were in a seal platoon.
01:22:00.68 --> 01:22:03.48 And I think I've told this story before.
01:22:03.48 --> 01:22:08.04 It was the one where the Marines like we would stay on the ship when we pulled an
01:22:08.04 --> 01:22:14.92 port and it would take like an hour to get off the ship because everyone would be waiting
01:22:14.92 --> 01:22:15.92 in line.
01:22:15.92 --> 01:22:19.32 And so what we would do is we would just work out for that hour hour and a half and
01:22:19.32 --> 01:22:20.32 it would go up.
01:22:20.32 --> 01:22:21.32 We could just walk right off the ship.
01:22:21.32 --> 01:22:26.32 Well, in that hour and a half the Marine, this young Marine had gone off the ship and was
01:22:26.32 --> 01:22:31.12 getting carried back onto the ship like passed out drunk covered in puke and an hour and a half.
01:22:31.12 --> 01:22:33.48 So that's what I think of when I figured these poor guys, can you come out and come
01:22:33.48 --> 01:22:34.48 off a bottle canal?
01:22:34.48 --> 01:22:36.92 You haven't even had water for six months.
01:22:36.92 --> 01:22:41.56 Never mind alcohol to the nightmare.
01:22:41.56 --> 01:22:45.56 But and of course they don't punish him too bad.
01:22:45.56 --> 01:22:48.80 Well, they they punish him, but they gotta keep him.
01:22:48.80 --> 01:22:50.44 You know, I mean, he's an able body Marine.
01:22:50.44 --> 01:22:53.24 They're not gonna, they're not gonna waste an able body Marine.
01:22:53.24 --> 01:22:56.84 And hopefully the Colonel in the back of his mind was thinking of himself, you know what?
01:22:56.84 --> 01:22:59.68 I want this guy and my, I want this guy with me.
01:22:59.68 --> 01:23:02.76 You know, this guy that's just gonna, you stole cigars from me?
01:23:02.76 --> 01:23:03.76 Cool.
01:23:03.76 --> 01:23:04.96 I'm gonna, I'm not threatening your life.
01:23:04.96 --> 01:23:07.68 Yeah, I'm just getting nuts.
01:23:07.68 --> 01:23:14.28 So they, but now Australia ends, they roll back out and it's time for them to start
01:23:14.28 --> 01:23:17.48 getting prepared to, they go to, they go to New Guinea.
01:23:17.48 --> 01:23:22.68 And if you remember New Guinea, that's another hard battle was fought there primarily by
01:23:22.68 --> 01:23:23.68 the Australians.
01:23:23.68 --> 01:23:31.12 It don't know just primarily, but the Australians definitely fought because I read that letter
01:23:31.12 --> 01:23:33.68 from the Australian soldier to his two year old daughter.
01:23:33.68 --> 01:23:41.12 That's where he died was a New Guinea, but now New Guinea is owned by the Allies and they
01:23:41.12 --> 01:23:45.28 go there to train to start to prepare for their next big push.
01:23:45.28 --> 01:23:46.64 And here we go back to the book.
01:23:46.64 --> 01:23:52.20 The truck climbed a series of small hills and finally deposited us in the middle of
01:23:52.20 --> 01:23:56.40 a field of Kuhnai grass, our new home.
01:23:56.40 --> 01:23:59.04 This is how the Marines train their men.
01:23:59.04 --> 01:24:06.12 Keep the mean and nasty like starving beasts says the core and they will fight better.
01:24:06.12 --> 01:24:11.56 When men are being moved from one place to another, spare no effort to make it painful.
01:24:11.56 --> 01:24:16.000 And before they've arrived at their destination, dispatch a man ahead to survey the
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.56 ground with an eye toward diff discomfort.
01:24:19.56 --> 01:24:22.80 So you hear this all the time that that's the Marine Corps.
01:24:22.80 --> 01:24:25.36 The Marine Corps is gonna make you so pissed off.
01:24:25.36 --> 01:24:28.36 By the time you go into battle, you're just gonna kill everybody.
01:24:28.36 --> 01:24:32.68 Because you're so sick of living in the dirt.
01:24:32.68 --> 01:24:41.16 Now they do a decent amount of training and now they're preparing to assault another island
01:24:41.16 --> 01:24:42.64 called New Britain.
01:24:42.64 --> 01:24:44.36 This is I found this very interesting.
01:24:44.36 --> 01:24:46.96 So back to the book.
01:24:46.96 --> 01:24:52.68 The commander called us together that night delivered an eve of battle speech.
01:24:52.68 --> 01:24:55.72 He spoke in deliberate but angry tones.
01:24:55.72 --> 01:25:01.64 He spoke like a man who hated the Japanese as though he had suffered a personal affront
01:25:01.64 --> 01:25:06.40 at their hands and was bent on personal vengeance.
01:25:06.40 --> 01:25:12.04 As though this were a personal, not mechanical war.
01:25:12.04 --> 01:25:14.32 His harang seemed unreal.
01:25:14.32 --> 01:25:19.96 It was unreal because it could never produce the desired effect.
01:25:19.96 --> 01:25:20.96 Kill the Japs.
01:25:20.96 --> 01:25:25.16 The commander was saying, I want you to kill Japs and I want you to remember that you're
01:25:25.16 --> 01:25:26.80 the Marines.
01:25:26.80 --> 01:25:31.08 We've got a tough job where we're going and where we're going, you won't have much
01:25:31.08 --> 01:25:32.72 room for ammunition.
01:25:32.72 --> 01:25:38.04 So you'd better be sure you see something before you shoot.
01:25:38.04 --> 01:25:42.08 Don't squeeze the trigger until you've got meat in your sights.
01:25:42.08 --> 01:25:49.56 And when you do spill blood, spill yellow blood.
01:25:49.56 --> 01:25:51.44 That was all.
01:25:51.44 --> 01:25:54.56 We walked back to the tents.
01:25:54.56 --> 01:25:57.04 It was Christmas Eve.
01:25:57.04 --> 01:25:58.44 And I find this.
01:25:58.44 --> 01:25:59.60 It's Christmas Eve.
01:25:59.60 --> 01:26:02.24 He gets this speech and you can see like he's sitting here.
01:26:02.24 --> 01:26:06.60 There's thinking, okay, this guy's trying to get him all riled up and it's not having any
01:26:06.60 --> 01:26:09.08 impact.
01:26:09.08 --> 01:26:15.000 And this is what I found to be the real dichotomy here at the tents.
01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.44 Father's straight was preparing to say midnight mass.
01:26:18.44 --> 01:26:23.68 So they have a japan there, Catholic japan father's straight.
01:26:23.68 --> 01:26:29.04 And here's what he says, Father's straight spoke gently.
01:26:29.04 --> 01:26:34.60 He reminded us that not all of us would live to see another Christmas that perhaps some
01:26:34.60 --> 01:26:38.80 of us might die this very day.
01:26:38.80 --> 01:26:44.20 He told us to be sorry for our sins to ask the forgiveness of God, to forgive those who
01:26:44.20 --> 01:26:51.92 had wronged us, to prepare our souls for death.
01:26:51.92 --> 01:26:59.52 We sang hymns, nineteen hundred and forty odd years ago, the babe had been born and Bethlehem
01:26:59.52 --> 01:27:08.64 and we celebrated him this night in a dark and misty forest that his father had wrought.
01:27:08.64 --> 01:27:19.80 We sang hymns to him, silent night and hark the herald angel sing, mild the he lays his glory
01:27:19.80 --> 01:27:27.36 by born that man no more may die.
01:27:27.36 --> 01:27:34.32 And tomorrow our hands would be stained with the blood of our brothers.
01:27:34.32 --> 01:27:41.68 But we sang on half-heartedly, half hopingly, sometimes mechanically, sometimes with a desperate
01:27:41.68 --> 01:27:56.000 driving poignancy one hand on the heart, the other on the hilt of a bayonet in the morning,
01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:03.56 we marched down to the ships.
01:28:03.56 --> 01:28:10.88 So much more impactful on him was what father straight and much more than the fiery kernel
01:28:10.88 --> 01:28:13.28 that said we're going to go kill japs here.
01:28:13.28 --> 01:28:21.54 These guys are, I mean can you imagine you go in for comfort to midnight mass, Christmas
01:28:21.54 --> 01:28:31.48 Eve and you get told that many people, many of you may die this very day and to prepare
01:28:31.48 --> 01:28:33.92 your soul for death.
01:28:33.92 --> 01:28:35.52 That's what these guys are facing.
01:28:35.52 --> 01:28:40.20 That's what they're most trusted, the most trusted person in their lives, right?
01:28:40.20 --> 01:28:43.72 Their spiritual counselor is telling them prepare for death.
01:28:43.72 --> 01:28:51.000 Yeah, kind of like we'll talk about sometimes where you get a guy, like if you're watching
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.24 a video and it's a guy getting you fired up, he's getting fired up to get you fired
01:28:55.24 --> 01:28:59.28 up, sometimes they can work but a lot of times that won't really work because you kind
01:28:59.28 --> 01:29:02.16 of feel like he's trying to sell you something.
01:29:02.16 --> 01:29:06.48 But then if you hear someone maybe even talking to someone else or talking about something
01:29:06.48 --> 01:29:12.24 else and you just kind of extrapolate certain things that get you fired up because it's
01:29:12.24 --> 01:29:13.24 so authentic.
01:29:13.24 --> 01:29:16.28 It's basically the indirect approach on your own mind.
01:29:16.28 --> 01:29:18.000 Yeah, and right, from mind.
01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:18.52 Yes.
01:29:18.52 --> 01:29:27.16 Back to the book on the sunless shores of New Britain where the rainforest crowded steeply
01:29:27.16 --> 01:29:33.40 down to the sea, we of the first Marine Division came back to the assault and it was here
01:29:33.40 --> 01:29:39.48 that we cut the Japanese to pieces literally when that devouring jungle did not dissolve
01:29:39.48 --> 01:29:40.48 them.
01:29:40.48 --> 01:29:45.16 And it was here that we pitted them.
01:29:45.16 --> 01:29:53.04 Now to pity the enemy is either madness or is it a sign or it is a sign of strength.
01:29:53.04 --> 01:30:00.40 I think that with the first Marine Division on New Britain, it was a sign of strength.
01:30:00.40 --> 01:30:08.64 He pitted him in the end this fleeing foe disorganized, demoralized crawling on hands
01:30:08.64 --> 01:30:14.64 and knees even in that dissolving downpour.
01:30:14.64 --> 01:30:20.92 For in the end it was we.
01:30:20.92 --> 01:30:28.24 The soft of feet Americans who had learned to get along in the jungle and who bore up
01:30:28.24 --> 01:30:40.60 the best beneath the ordeal of the monsoon and in these things lay our strength.
01:30:40.60 --> 01:30:43.88 And I'll tell you what I think that boils down to.
01:30:43.88 --> 01:30:46.80 So what they're saying here is these, you know, the Americans, what do people around
01:30:46.80 --> 01:30:48.16 the world think of the Americans?
01:30:48.16 --> 01:30:51.68 Even in 1943, Americans are soft.
01:30:51.68 --> 01:30:53.68 Americans are lazy Americans.
01:30:53.68 --> 01:30:55.000 They have too much comfort.
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.96 And you think the exact opposite of the Japanese, especially in World War II, the Imperial
01:30:58.96 --> 01:31:05.96 Japanese Army, it was highly disciplined, it was extremely strict, it was a Spartan lifestyle.
01:31:05.96 --> 01:31:09.32 But look at what happened here and why is that?
01:31:09.32 --> 01:31:11.36 And I'll tell you why.
01:31:11.36 --> 01:31:13.96 In my opinion, I will tell you why.
01:31:13.96 --> 01:31:18.52 Because you have men that are fighting for freedom.
01:31:18.52 --> 01:31:20.40 They're fighting for freedom.
01:31:20.40 --> 01:31:25.96 And that makes all the difference in the world fighting for individual freedom, fighting for
01:31:25.96 --> 01:31:30.04 their personal freedom and fighting for their nations freedom and fighting for their nations
01:31:30.04 --> 01:31:34.20 freedom and its nation that is based upon freedom.
01:31:34.20 --> 01:31:49.36 That right there is stronger than any tyrannical government or any fanatical idea.
01:31:49.36 --> 01:31:52.64 The idea of freedom is stronger than the most.
01:31:52.64 --> 01:32:02.08 And that is why these quote, soft Americans, that is why they were able to conquer and
01:32:02.08 --> 01:32:03.52 defeat this enemy.
01:32:03.52 --> 01:32:12.60 This hardened enemy, this well-trained enemy.
01:32:12.60 --> 01:32:19.12 And this talks a little bit about what we were facing.
01:32:19.12 --> 01:32:23.76 To the north one patrol discovered the body of an e-companies scout who had been reported
01:32:23.76 --> 01:32:25.56 missing.
01:32:25.56 --> 01:32:30.60 The area bore the marks of a struggle as though we had fought hand to hand.
01:32:30.60 --> 01:32:38.000 His body bore dozens of bayonet wounds, they had used him for bayonet practice.
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:43.52 In his mouth, they had stuffed flesh, they had cut from his arm.
01:32:43.52 --> 01:32:46.28 His buddy said he had a tattoo there.
01:32:46.28 --> 01:32:52.04 The marine emblem, the fouled anchor, and the globe.
01:32:52.04 --> 01:32:57.80 The japs cut it off and stuffed it in his mouth.
01:32:57.80 --> 01:33:01.72 The commander was angry.
01:33:01.72 --> 01:33:06.64 Again to the north, two Japanese officers had been caught snooping around our positions
01:33:06.64 --> 01:33:09.32 and had been killed.
01:33:09.32 --> 01:33:13.80 An e-companie outpost scouting the terrain at their front and discovered a Japanese force
01:33:13.80 --> 01:33:19.40 in platoon strength, sleeping, sleeping on the ground, sleeping.
01:33:19.40 --> 01:33:27.20 They fired into them into these sleeping supermen of the jungle with drawing upon the approach
01:33:27.20 --> 01:33:35.68 of another enemy platoon.
01:33:35.68 --> 01:33:42.68 And after this, after the bulk of the battle takes place and it was fair.
01:33:42.68 --> 01:33:47.96 It was not a fair fight and you're about to find out why.
01:33:47.96 --> 01:33:52.52 Back to the book, four Japanese soldiers and one officer had been taken alive and had been
01:33:52.52 --> 01:33:57.80 brought down to the CP, their arms bound behind them knives at their throats and from them
01:33:57.80 --> 01:34:03.24 we learned that the third company, 53rd Regiment of the Japanese 17th Division, had been
01:34:03.24 --> 01:34:10.44 dispatched from the main body at Cape Clouster to defend against our landing.
01:34:10.44 --> 01:34:15.84 The passage had been through near imprenetrable jungle and they had not arrived on the scene
01:34:15.84 --> 01:34:20.44 until two days after our own coming.
01:34:20.44 --> 01:34:23.48 Nevertheless, they attacked us.
01:34:23.48 --> 01:34:30.08 They attacked us, some 100 of them against our force of some 1200 and but for the prisoners
01:34:30.08 --> 01:34:33.72 we had annihilated them.
01:34:33.72 --> 01:34:35.84 Were they brave or fanatical?
01:34:35.84 --> 01:34:37.80 What had they hoped to gain?
01:34:37.80 --> 01:34:41.76 Did their commander really believe that a company of Japanese soldiers could conquer a battalion
01:34:41.76 --> 01:34:47.88 of American Marines experienced confident, better armed and placed on higher ground?
01:34:47.88 --> 01:34:51.24 Why did not turn around and march his men home again?
01:34:51.24 --> 01:34:54.64 Was it because no Japanese soldier can report failure?
01:34:54.64 --> 01:34:58.12 Cannot lose face?
01:34:58.12 --> 01:35:01.08 I cannot answer.
01:35:01.08 --> 01:35:07.76 Our dead were six men among them the stubby and trepured OB, whom I'd last seen in Melbourne
01:35:07.76 --> 01:35:12.92 and so drunk he could barely stand, whose gun pit had been overrun when the japs overwhelmed
01:35:12.92 --> 01:35:17.000 the section of the lines and their first silent rush up the hillside.
01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:23.40 OB, who had helped to drive them out in the counter attack and who had been alternatingly
01:35:23.40 --> 01:35:29.32 firing and hurling implications at them until one of their bullets took him squarely in the
01:35:29.32 --> 01:35:32.32 forehead.
01:35:32.32 --> 01:35:35.24 May he rest in peace.
01:35:35.24 --> 01:35:40.08 The Japanese dead lay in heaps on the hillside and they filled the trench where OB's
01:35:40.08 --> 01:35:48.76 gun had been located.
01:35:48.76 --> 01:35:54.56 So that shows the will of the Japanese fighters no doubt about it.
01:35:54.56 --> 01:36:00.12 They were hard core and they got told to attack with a hundred eyes against nine hundred
01:36:00.12 --> 01:36:05.20 or twelve hundred and they said, alright, let's do this.
01:36:05.20 --> 01:36:15.20 Now, the life, the existence in this jungle was harsh back to the book.
01:36:15.20 --> 01:36:20.88 The puffing of my lips and eyes symbolized the mystery and poison of this terrible island.
01:36:20.88 --> 01:36:26.24 Mysterious, perhaps I mean to say new Britain was evil, darkly and secretly evil, a
01:36:26.24 --> 01:36:30.40 malifactor and enemy of humankind.
01:36:30.40 --> 01:36:36.64 An adversary really dissolving, corroding, poisoning, chilling, sucking, drenching, coming
01:36:36.64 --> 01:36:42.66 at a man with its rolling, mist, green mold and ceaseless downpour, tripping him with his
01:36:42.66 --> 01:36:48.42 numberless roots and vines, poisoning him with green insects and bugs and treacherous
01:36:48.42 --> 01:36:54.36 tree bark, turning the sun from his bones and cheer from his heart dissolving him.
01:36:54.36 --> 01:37:01.40 The rain, the mold, the damp steadily pucking each, plucking each cell apart like tiny hands
01:37:01.40 --> 01:37:05.08 tearing at the petals of a flower, dissolving him.
01:37:05.08 --> 01:37:12.24 I say into a mindless, formless fluid like the sop of mud into which his feet forever fall
01:37:12.24 --> 01:37:19.16 in a monotonous, slopsuck, slopsuck, that is the sound of nothingness, the song of the jungle
01:37:19.16 --> 01:37:26.44 wherein everything falls apart in hollow harmony with the rain.
01:37:26.44 --> 01:37:28.04 Nothing could stand against it.
01:37:28.04 --> 01:37:32.12 A letter home had to be read and re-read and memorized for a fell apart in your pocket
01:37:32.12 --> 01:37:33.28 in less than a week.
01:37:33.28 --> 01:37:35.72 A pair of socks lasted no longer.
01:37:35.72 --> 01:37:41.08 A pack of cigarettes became sodden and worthless unless smoked that day.
01:37:41.08 --> 01:37:45.92 Pocket knife blades rusted together, watches recorded the period of their own decay.
01:37:45.92 --> 01:37:51.40 Rain made garbage of the food, pencil swelled and burst apart, fountain pens clogged and
01:37:51.40 --> 01:37:52.84 their points separated.
01:37:52.84 --> 01:37:56.84 Rifle barrels turned blue with mold and had to be slung upside down to keep out the
01:37:56.84 --> 01:37:57.84 rain.
01:37:57.84 --> 01:38:01.84 Bullets stuck together in rifle magazines and machine gunners had to go over their belts
01:38:01.84 --> 01:38:06.44 daily, extracting and oiling and reinserting the bullets to prevent them from sticking
01:38:06.44 --> 01:38:08.24 to the cloth loops.
01:38:08.24 --> 01:38:13.96 And everything lay, damp and sodden and squashed to the touch, exuding that steady musty
01:38:13.96 --> 01:38:19.96 weak that is the jungle's own, that individual odor of decay rising from vegetable life
01:38:19.96 --> 01:38:25.84 so luxurious and growing so swiftly that it seems to hasten the decomposition from the
01:38:25.84 --> 01:38:28.84 moment of birth.
01:38:28.84 --> 01:38:33.76 It was into this green hell that we were inserted a day or two after the march.
01:38:33.76 --> 01:38:37.64 And here was fought that battle with the rain forest.
01:38:37.64 --> 01:38:43.28 Here the jungle and the men were locked in conflict far more basic than our shooting
01:38:43.28 --> 01:38:45.52 war the Japanese for here.
01:38:45.52 --> 01:38:51.12 The struggle was for existence itself.
01:38:51.12 --> 01:38:56.56 The war was forgotten who could comprehend it.
01:38:56.56 --> 01:39:02.20 Who cared.
01:39:02.20 --> 01:39:07.40 And what do you say?
01:39:07.40 --> 01:39:09.40 And I have not spent that much time in the jungle.
01:39:09.40 --> 01:39:15.96 I spent some, I think the longs I've been in the jungle is maybe a month and it wasn't
01:39:15.96 --> 01:39:16.96 as bad as this.
01:39:16.96 --> 01:39:19.24 It wasn't raining as that much.
01:39:19.24 --> 01:39:24.40 But I can't even imagine just that constant.
01:39:24.40 --> 01:39:26.16 There's no escape from it.
01:39:26.16 --> 01:39:27.64 There's no escape from it.
01:39:27.64 --> 01:39:31.64 And it's even worse for leki and I'll tell you why.
01:39:31.64 --> 01:39:33.32 Back to the book.
01:39:33.32 --> 01:39:37.24 I would be wet not only from the rain.
01:39:37.24 --> 01:39:41.48 There's sometimes it stopped and at other times it did not fall so fast that a jungle
01:39:41.48 --> 01:39:43.92 hammock could not repel it.
01:39:43.92 --> 01:39:49.000 But because an affliction which I had begun, which had begun the moment I left Australia,
01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:52.76 was now again active.
01:39:52.76 --> 01:39:57.88 It had begun during the discomforts of grotto can now had disappeared in the civilized
01:39:57.88 --> 01:40:02.16 living of Melbourne and had reappeared.
01:40:02.16 --> 01:40:09.40 On good enough island, New Guinea and now on New Britain.
01:40:09.40 --> 01:40:15.24 I learned later from doctors to call it an e-reases.
01:40:15.24 --> 01:40:18.64 Winnersleep, the bladder empties.
01:40:18.64 --> 01:40:22.72 And that is that.
01:40:22.72 --> 01:40:26.36 So he puts that really nicely.
01:40:26.36 --> 01:40:28.72 But here's what's going on.
01:40:28.72 --> 01:40:33.28 This is the stress that he's under when he goes to bed.
01:40:33.28 --> 01:40:36.24 He pisses in his pants.
01:40:36.24 --> 01:40:41.76 And it's just he can't stop it.
01:40:41.76 --> 01:40:44.64 There's nothing he can do about it.
01:40:44.64 --> 01:40:48.64 And it won't go away.
01:40:48.64 --> 01:40:50.04 In fact, it went away.
01:40:50.04 --> 01:40:52.80 It will go away when the stress stops.
01:40:52.80 --> 01:40:54.28 When he went to Melbourne, it's all good.
01:40:54.28 --> 01:40:55.44 It stops.
01:40:55.44 --> 01:40:59.40 It's going to go away when he gets back out there in the stress of combat, the stress of the environment.
01:40:59.40 --> 01:41:04.24 And when he goes to bed, he pisses himself.
01:41:04.24 --> 01:41:15.12 And certainly he made a decision to put that in this book for a reason.
01:41:15.12 --> 01:41:18.76 And there is, it does fall into the story a little bit.
01:41:18.76 --> 01:41:24.92 But the reason I love that he put it in there is because it's just another thing.
01:41:24.92 --> 01:41:26.36 He's dealing with.
01:41:26.36 --> 01:41:27.76 And he's not even ashamed of it.
01:41:27.76 --> 01:41:32.96 He said, yeah, I'm stressed out.
01:41:32.96 --> 01:41:34.60 Scared.
01:41:34.60 --> 01:41:35.60 And I'm pissing myself.
01:41:35.60 --> 01:41:36.60 But guess what?
01:41:36.60 --> 01:41:41.92 I'm still going on patrol.
01:41:41.92 --> 01:41:42.92 Back to the book.
01:41:42.92 --> 01:41:45.76 The last patrol was a prolonged one of several days.
01:41:45.76 --> 01:41:52.40 We were taken by landing boat down the east coast to a place called Old Notamo.
01:41:52.40 --> 01:41:54.88 And there deposited.
01:41:54.88 --> 01:42:02.12 The place had once been inhabited by the Japs, but all their emplacements were now empty.
01:42:02.12 --> 01:42:08.40 Those of the enemy who were discovered were in the last extremities of Ordeal.
01:42:08.40 --> 01:42:12.04 Some were overtaken, crawling on their hands and knees.
01:42:12.04 --> 01:42:18.08 Some so badly decomposed it was as though their feet were rotting off.
01:42:18.08 --> 01:42:21.16 Some weighing perhaps no more than 80 pounds.
01:42:21.16 --> 01:42:28.76 Some were not weapons, all without food and all possessed of that indelentible fighting spirit.
01:42:28.76 --> 01:42:33.04 That was the Japanese Imperial Army's greatest asset.
01:42:33.04 --> 01:42:40.72 The one single factor that made a poorly equipped soldier a first-rate foe.
01:42:40.72 --> 01:42:43.000 They all resisted.
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.64 And they were all destroyed, bayoneted for the most part.
01:42:47.64 --> 01:42:55.48 It was file for it was folly to fire on patrol in unfriendly unknown territory.
01:42:55.48 --> 01:43:00.84 One of these stragglers was strangled and cold blood by the kid, a youngster who, although
01:43:00.84 --> 01:43:07.20 already a veteran of gullal can now, was hardly acquainted with a razor.
01:43:07.20 --> 01:43:11.88 He would go mad two months later.
01:43:11.88 --> 01:43:19.16 So they come up across these Japanese, total 80 pounds malnourished.
01:43:19.16 --> 01:43:27.56 Some of them didn't even have weapons and they're just trying to fight anyways.
01:43:27.56 --> 01:43:30.52 He ends up with a hernia.
01:43:30.52 --> 01:43:34.28 It's a leaky, ends up with a hernia.
01:43:34.28 --> 01:43:40.04 And he gets pulled off to go take a look at his hernia.
01:43:40.04 --> 01:43:42.96 And they say, yeah, you got a bad hernia.
01:43:42.96 --> 01:43:43.96 But it's not bad enough.
01:43:43.96 --> 01:43:47.32 You're going back to the front.
01:43:47.32 --> 01:43:50.92 Then the army comes and replaces them there.
01:43:50.92 --> 01:43:57.80 And next thing, next move is they go to train at a place called Pavuvo.
01:43:57.80 --> 01:44:04.36 Pavu Islander doing another training to get ready for another island campaign.
01:44:04.36 --> 01:44:05.48 And here we go back to the book.
01:44:05.48 --> 01:44:07.08 The food was bad too.
01:44:07.08 --> 01:44:09.44 And the tents were rotten and punctured with holes.
01:44:09.44 --> 01:44:13.44 There was no water, except for what was caught in her helmets during the night.
01:44:13.44 --> 01:44:17.92 We bathed by dashing naked into the rain, soaping ourselves, madly in a race against the
01:44:17.92 --> 01:44:23.52 probability of the rain ceasing and being left streaked with sticky stope soap.
01:44:23.52 --> 01:44:28.08 And we washed our clothes by boiling them in cans of rain water.
01:44:28.08 --> 01:44:33.24 Our jungle rot had become so bad, so persistent that there was an appointed time each
01:44:33.24 --> 01:44:38.20 afternoon for the men to take off their shoes and socks and to lie out on their sacks with
01:44:38.20 --> 01:44:42.68 corrosive feet thrust out into the sun.
01:44:42.68 --> 01:44:45.80 But we had borne all this before.
01:44:45.80 --> 01:44:47.76 And we could bear it again.
01:44:47.76 --> 01:44:54.12 Nor could mere bad food or leaky tents press upon the ardor of my comrades.
01:44:54.12 --> 01:44:58.72 It was the death of hope that bore us down.
01:44:58.72 --> 01:45:05.76 There had always been hope, hope of relief, hope of the sun, hope of victory, hope of survival.
01:45:05.76 --> 01:45:11.36 But when they came and told us that none of us were going home on rotation, we strangled
01:45:11.36 --> 01:45:15.44 hope and turned into wooden soldiers.
01:45:15.44 --> 01:45:23.20 The future looked to innumerable enemy held islands and innumerable assaults and we had already
01:45:23.20 --> 01:45:28.88 noticed how the ranks of the new river originals were dwindling with every action.
01:45:28.88 --> 01:45:35.72 There were even a few suicides to suggest how to spare some could find the situation.
01:45:35.72 --> 01:45:41.60 Then the thing changed.
01:45:41.60 --> 01:45:45.88 They came and said half of the originals could go home.
01:45:45.88 --> 01:45:47.44 So these guys get to word.
01:45:47.44 --> 01:45:53.92 Hey look, we're praying for another salt, but half of you originals are going to go home.
01:45:53.92 --> 01:46:01.44 There was joy and then once the method of selection for the state side bound became known,
01:46:01.44 --> 01:46:03.72 there was anger.
01:46:03.72 --> 01:46:10.40 There would be a drawing, a state side lottery, in which men's names were repold from a hat.
01:46:10.40 --> 01:46:15.40 But only the names of those who had never been in trouble.
01:46:15.40 --> 01:46:20.88 I was among those whose name did not go into the hat, and so was runner and housher and
01:46:20.88 --> 01:46:24.84 chicken and souvenirs and a host of others.
01:46:24.84 --> 01:46:29.32 It seemed that the originals of the second battalion first marines had been neatly divided
01:46:29.32 --> 01:46:33.40 into good guys and bad guys.
01:46:33.40 --> 01:46:37.96 Among us they raged a profane anger.
01:46:37.96 --> 01:46:43.60 I know now how a convict must feel upon being turned down a job after being turned
01:46:43.60 --> 01:46:47.80 down a job after job because of its past.
01:46:47.80 --> 01:46:50.72 That was what disqualified us our past.
01:46:50.72 --> 01:46:53.28 It made no difference that we had been punished.
01:46:53.28 --> 01:46:58.64 Yes, punished again and again for to become customary to solve all problems of selection
01:46:58.64 --> 01:47:07.52 this way by marking brig rats for dirty duty and excluding them from special benefits.
01:47:07.52 --> 01:47:16.000 Nor did it matter that we had good war records.
01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:22.88 In retrospect, it's easy to forgive my commanders this, but then it was hard.
01:47:22.88 --> 01:47:28.56 It was too much like being unfairly condemned to death.
01:47:28.56 --> 01:47:33.64 The injustice of it overwhelmed me and I burned with a resentment that was dangerous to carry
01:47:33.64 --> 01:47:37.44 around.
01:47:37.44 --> 01:47:39.60 So what a one.
01:47:39.60 --> 01:47:41.84 What a nightmare.
01:47:41.84 --> 01:47:43.48 They say look we're going to have a little lottery.
01:47:43.48 --> 01:47:46.44 Some of you guys are going to get a home everyone's happy and say by the way if you've
01:47:46.44 --> 01:47:49.84 been in any trouble you don't get on the list.
01:47:49.84 --> 01:47:51.24 That's a death sentence.
01:47:51.24 --> 01:47:52.44 The way he's seen it.
01:47:52.44 --> 01:47:53.44 There's a death sentence.
01:47:53.44 --> 01:47:56.44 I'm going to keep doing this island hopping campaign.
01:47:56.44 --> 01:47:57.68 We're going to keep going.
01:47:57.68 --> 01:48:01.12 There's all these innumerable islands that need to be taken down.
01:48:01.12 --> 01:48:05.20 You're going to be on all of them and you've already seen X number of guys that you had
01:48:05.20 --> 01:48:08.48 killed and you're going to keep going until you're killed.
01:48:08.48 --> 01:48:10.24 So this was like a death sentence.
01:48:10.24 --> 01:48:14.56 Meanwhile the guys who might be able to go there just they're right there.
01:48:14.56 --> 01:48:18.000 And you're right next to you.
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.20 And those guys probably did a lot of the same crap.
01:48:22.20 --> 01:48:32.72 Yeah, yeah, so the back to the book, my and your recess was more noticeable than before.
01:48:32.72 --> 01:48:36.72 Perhaps to the agitation of the moment aggravated it.
01:48:36.72 --> 01:48:41.12 I know that the men in my tent had been urging me to report it to sick bay.
01:48:41.12 --> 01:48:47.000 I did the doctor who knew of my case ordered me to banika.
01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:47.96 I was leaving in the morning.
01:48:47.96 --> 01:48:54.64 So with that, he basically says, okay, you know what, I'm pissing on myself.
01:48:54.64 --> 01:48:57.000 The guys have been telling me to go see the doctor about it.
01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:58.84 I haven't done that.
01:48:58.84 --> 01:49:00.28 I have a hernia.
01:49:00.28 --> 01:49:01.68 I'm going to go to medical.
01:49:01.68 --> 01:49:04.88 So he goes to medical and the doctor says, okay, you're going to go to banika.
01:49:04.88 --> 01:49:12.96 And banika is a is a island where they just are set up to handle wounded.
01:49:12.96 --> 01:49:19.68 And when he gets to banika, it's it's kind of shocking back to the book.
01:49:19.68 --> 01:49:21.24 Banika was a flesh pot.
01:49:21.24 --> 01:49:22.92 Banika was the big town.
01:49:22.92 --> 01:49:25.20 Banika was Broadway.
01:49:25.20 --> 01:49:26.36 Banika had women.
01:49:26.36 --> 01:49:28.64 It had buildings of steel and wood.
01:49:28.64 --> 01:49:29.64 It had roads.
01:49:29.64 --> 01:49:35.12 It had thousands of sailors as sleek as campans.
01:49:35.12 --> 01:49:37.60 It had movie amphitheaters.
01:49:37.60 --> 01:49:42.92 It had electric lights.
01:49:42.92 --> 01:49:47.52 It had canteens overflowing with candy and comforts.
01:49:47.52 --> 01:49:49.52 Banika had beer.
01:49:49.52 --> 01:49:52.92 Walking with the others from the beach to the navy hospital, I felt like a hick on his first
01:49:52.92 --> 01:49:54.36 visit to New York.
01:49:54.36 --> 01:50:00.12 Jeeps and trucks and staff cars swept over the islands, roads, raising a busy cloud of dust,
01:50:00.12 --> 01:50:04.12 cranes, croaked and cranked on the beach, loading and unloading the boats.
01:50:04.12 --> 01:50:10.04 And peas patrol the stockade of pointed sticks behind which, to well, the women.
01:50:10.04 --> 01:50:14.08 The navy nurses and red crossworkers.
01:50:14.08 --> 01:50:17.08 Everyone was well fed and unwured.
01:50:17.08 --> 01:50:23.48 The seat of every pair of pants was filled and happy.
01:50:23.48 --> 01:50:30.000 We, the lean ones, who wore our discontent on our faces and carried our nervous impatience
01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:36.84 in our hands, must have been a disturbing presence in that pouring island incubator.
01:50:36.84 --> 01:50:44.56 Yet as I walked along, I was filled with the uneasy suspicion that it would be the image
01:50:44.56 --> 01:50:53.16 of Banika and not pervue that would be presented to America as the Pacific War.
01:50:53.16 --> 01:50:57.48 They do that pretty good job of this in the series.
01:50:57.48 --> 01:51:03.000 That is good as they could have done because they show the guys coming on to a beach and
01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.40 there's nurses and they're dressed in like a beautiful clean white and they're literally
01:51:06.40 --> 01:51:11.36 handing out lemonade and it's such a contradiction to what they've been living.
01:51:11.36 --> 01:51:16.84 So you get that, but this image is even crazier in my mind of coming on this island.
01:51:16.84 --> 01:51:20.92 You become an off-pavu voo voo, you're living in the hell.
01:51:20.92 --> 01:51:24.68 And here these guys are whatever a quick flight away and they've got movie theaters and
01:51:24.68 --> 01:51:27.08 they've got beer and they've got women running around.
01:51:27.08 --> 01:51:29.72 It's just totally, totally different.
01:51:29.72 --> 01:51:31.48 And I've talked about that a bunch of times in here.
01:51:31.48 --> 01:51:35.04 You could be, you could be in World War II.
01:51:35.04 --> 01:51:39.44 But if you were on the island of Banika, wasn't that much of a sacrifice as it was compared
01:51:39.44 --> 01:51:41.68 to somebody that was on the island-happened campaign?
01:51:41.68 --> 01:51:42.68 It's not.
01:51:42.68 --> 01:51:43.68 And it's the same thing.
01:51:43.68 --> 01:51:47.000 There's places I wasn't Iraq where I would say, God, this is crazy.
01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000 How nice this is.
01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.80 They got a swimming pool.
01:51:50.80 --> 01:51:53.32 The baits some of the baits said swimming pools.
01:51:53.32 --> 01:51:54.32 They got a nice gym.
01:51:54.32 --> 01:51:55.32 They got a nice childhood.
01:51:55.32 --> 01:52:01.16 Then you go out to some outstation in the middle of some forward operating base.
01:52:01.16 --> 01:52:09.48 And these dudes would be living hard, totally different for different people.
01:52:09.48 --> 01:52:15.36 Now leki gets put basically into a psych ward.
01:52:15.36 --> 01:52:16.92 They want to look at him.
01:52:16.92 --> 01:52:23.000 And he starts having this conversation with a psychologist.
01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:27.16 And I think this is a very important conversation.
01:52:27.16 --> 01:52:28.16 Back to the book.
01:52:28.16 --> 01:52:31.24 He began to question me about my experiences in war.
01:52:31.24 --> 01:52:35.84 And as I told them to him, he shook his head from side to side as though to indicate that
01:52:35.84 --> 01:52:41.16 my whole division not only myself ought to be psychoanalyzed.
01:52:41.16 --> 01:52:45.96 Then we talked of books for he was well read and philosophy.
01:52:45.96 --> 01:52:50.04 Suddenly he broke it off and said, what did you say you were?
01:52:50.04 --> 01:52:52.96 Meaning what did you say you did in the Marine Corps?
01:52:52.96 --> 01:52:58.88 A scout I said, Bradley, I used to be a machine gunner.
01:52:58.88 --> 01:53:04.40 And the doctor says back, but that's no place for a man of your caliber.
01:53:04.40 --> 01:53:07.36 Now I was shocked.
01:53:07.36 --> 01:53:15.80 The old Shibaleth intelligence had not our government been culpable enough in pampering
01:53:15.80 --> 01:53:22.92 the high IQ drafties as though they were too intelligent to fight for their country.
01:53:22.92 --> 01:53:31.64 Could not doctor gentle see that I was proud to be a scout and before that a machine gunner
01:53:31.64 --> 01:53:35.16 intelligence intelligence intelligence.
01:53:35.16 --> 01:53:37.000 Keep it up America.
01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:44.04 Keep telling your youth that mud and danger are fit only for intellectual pigs.
01:53:44.04 --> 01:53:50.44 Keep on saying that only the stupid are fit to sacrifice that America must be defended
01:53:50.44 --> 01:53:52.64 by the low brow.
01:53:52.64 --> 01:54:01.12 Keep in mind that the high brow keep fawning head over heart and soon the head will arrive
01:54:01.12 --> 01:54:08.16 at the complete folly of any kind of fight and meetly surrender the treasure to the first
01:54:08.16 --> 01:54:15.16 bandit with enough heart to demand it.
01:54:15.16 --> 01:54:19.000 Be careful.
01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:25.52 I think that we do a really good job now in America.
01:54:25.52 --> 01:54:31.52 You get kids that are, you know, there will be enlisted kids with bachelor's degrees
01:54:31.52 --> 01:54:37.52 and master's degrees in the army and the Marine Corps and the Seal teams.
01:54:37.52 --> 01:54:41.48 I don't think we have that as much, but it's definitely something that you need to
01:54:41.48 --> 01:54:42.48 watch out for.
01:54:42.48 --> 01:54:46.28 I think especially this goes back to judgment.
01:54:46.28 --> 01:54:48.56 I posted that earlier today.
01:54:48.56 --> 01:54:54.60 I met some young Marine, not a young Marine, but you know, guys probably 25, 27 years old
01:54:54.60 --> 01:54:58.04 and he came into the gym and you know, some say, I use in the Marine Corps.
01:54:58.04 --> 01:54:59.60 That's awesome man.
01:54:59.60 --> 01:55:00.60 What's doing the Marine Corps?
01:55:00.60 --> 01:55:03.04 He was like, I was a machine gunner.
01:55:03.04 --> 01:55:07.52 Like yes, like yes, that's awesome.
01:55:07.52 --> 01:55:12.92 But to have somebody think, oh, you were just a machine gunner, you must know.
01:55:12.92 --> 01:55:25.48 Be the machine gunner should be a faunted and elevated position in the world.
01:55:25.48 --> 01:55:30.16 Bless the machine gunner is not there.
01:55:30.16 --> 01:55:32.44 You want to talk about a person that can get stuff done.
01:55:32.44 --> 01:55:34.16 Go talk to a machine gunner.
01:55:34.16 --> 01:55:36.36 They'll make some stuff happen.
01:55:36.36 --> 01:55:39.68 They're carrying a big peg of gun around.
01:55:39.68 --> 01:55:44.16 They're laying down fire under pressure, put him off.
01:55:44.16 --> 01:55:46.92 I'll put the machine gunner up against one of these intellectuals.
01:55:46.92 --> 01:55:49.32 Eddie, day the week, bring it.
01:55:49.32 --> 01:55:51.28 But the machine gunner can be an intellectual.
01:55:51.28 --> 01:55:52.88 Absolutely.
01:55:52.88 --> 01:55:53.88 Absolutely.
01:55:53.88 --> 01:55:54.88 That's the point.
01:55:54.88 --> 01:55:55.88 Yeah.
01:55:55.88 --> 01:55:56.88 That's the point.
01:55:56.88 --> 01:56:00.36 Just because someone chooses to do something that's hard doesn't mean that they're
01:56:00.36 --> 01:56:01.36 not smart.
01:56:01.36 --> 01:56:02.36 Right.
01:56:02.36 --> 01:56:09.64 In fact, I go so as far as to say they are searching for.
01:56:09.64 --> 01:56:19.04 And discovering and becoming something that takes a level of mind power to do.
01:56:19.04 --> 01:56:20.04 Yeah.
01:56:20.04 --> 01:56:27.04 Kind of like that the week superficial assumption is that, oh, you're going to choose that
01:56:27.04 --> 01:56:28.52 kind of that hard thing.
01:56:28.52 --> 01:56:32.40 Because it's not really intuitive to just, I'm going to go for the hardest thing.
01:56:32.40 --> 01:56:37.72 It's intuitive to be like, I want to get this easy thing to do because it's easier.
01:56:37.72 --> 01:56:42.16 So when someone chooses the hard thing to do, the kind of assumption is that, oh, you
01:56:42.16 --> 01:56:43.16 had no other choice.
01:56:43.16 --> 01:56:44.16 Oh, yeah.
01:56:44.16 --> 01:56:45.16 Yes.
01:56:45.16 --> 01:56:46.16 Perfect.
01:56:46.16 --> 01:56:47.16 But, yes.
01:56:47.16 --> 01:56:48.16 No, man.
01:56:48.16 --> 01:56:50.48 I think that's a guy in high school where he's a year old in us.
01:56:50.48 --> 01:56:55.20 And he was like a smart guy and had all his stuff to get a good family and he went
01:56:55.20 --> 01:56:56.44 into the army.
01:56:56.44 --> 01:57:00.88 And I remember some people were like kind of surprised because they're going to just
01:57:00.88 --> 01:57:03.56 to the army that just like Dr. Gentle here.
01:57:03.56 --> 01:57:05.36 Oh, what are you doing that for?
01:57:05.36 --> 01:57:06.96 Because I want to be a machine gunner.
01:57:06.96 --> 01:57:07.96 Yeah, that's why.
01:57:07.96 --> 01:57:08.96 Yeah.
01:57:08.96 --> 01:57:13.12 Props to the machine gunners.
01:57:13.12 --> 01:57:16.24 Now out on the silent, he's there.
01:57:16.24 --> 01:57:24.36 He spends like a month and they're sitting down to watch a movie at the theater.
01:57:24.36 --> 01:57:25.36 I'll play that.
01:57:25.36 --> 01:57:30.40 Remember one time we had the awesome C-B's that worked for Winner Maudi with us.
01:57:30.40 --> 01:57:33.08 And so they're building bunkers.
01:57:33.08 --> 01:57:34.08 I'm not kidding.
01:57:34.08 --> 01:57:37.80 What were their priority builds when they were in the body with me on our little camp,
01:57:37.80 --> 01:57:39.56 camp, Mark Lee?
01:57:39.56 --> 01:57:47.48 The priorities that they were working on were bunkers were security walls on the river,
01:57:47.48 --> 01:57:48.48 getting barbed wire.
01:57:48.48 --> 01:57:50.04 Those are the priorities they were working on.
01:57:50.04 --> 01:57:53.36 And my lead CB, my CB chief.
01:57:53.36 --> 01:57:59.28 He had to go to our headquarters for a couple days to get money and get equipment and
01:57:59.28 --> 01:58:00.28 whatever.
01:58:00.28 --> 01:58:04.88 And when he came back, he was great dude.
01:58:04.88 --> 01:58:07.28 His nickname was Biggie.
01:58:07.28 --> 01:58:09.28 And he was big.
01:58:09.28 --> 01:58:11.28 Another one of those things.
01:58:11.28 --> 01:58:12.28 Yeah, yeah.
01:58:12.28 --> 01:58:18.28 No, he would, he would, like his warm-up sets on bench, we're in three 15.
01:58:18.28 --> 01:58:19.28 He was big.
01:58:19.28 --> 01:58:20.28 Big strong.
01:58:20.28 --> 01:58:21.28 Yeah.
01:58:21.28 --> 01:58:22.28 He was strong.
01:58:22.28 --> 01:58:27.60 And he came back and, you know, he says, he says, hey sir, come back from Fouloujia.
01:58:27.60 --> 01:58:29.20 And I was like, oh, everything cool out there.
01:58:29.20 --> 01:58:30.20 He goes, let me tell you something.
01:58:30.20 --> 01:58:32.20 I was like, what's that, Biggie?
01:58:32.20 --> 01:58:34.20 He says, you know what they're building out there?
01:58:34.20 --> 01:58:36.20 I said, no, I have no idea.
01:58:36.20 --> 01:58:37.20 I don't care what they're building out there.
01:58:37.20 --> 01:58:40.72 Because they're building the theater.
01:58:40.72 --> 01:58:41.72 I said, what?
01:58:41.72 --> 01:58:43.44 He said, they're building the theater.
01:58:43.44 --> 01:58:45.60 I said, you mean a movie theater?
01:58:45.60 --> 01:58:48.92 He goes, yes, off the theater.
01:58:48.92 --> 01:58:51.08 And he was just beside himself.
01:58:51.08 --> 01:58:56.000 Because here we were trying to build bunkers and security walls, they were building
01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:57.000 the theater.
01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000 We didn't make it in like that.
01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:03.000 But those CVs man, they kept us, they kept everything wrong and wrong.
01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:08.000 And props, once you were props to the machine gunners, props to the CVs.
01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:09.000 Oh, for sure.
01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:14.16 So they're an a theater that had been built out here.
01:59:14.16 --> 01:59:19.16 And the movie began, there was an interruption over a public-adjust system of voice announced
01:59:19.16 --> 01:59:23.40 allied troops have just invaded northern France.
01:59:23.40 --> 01:59:26.76 The second front has been opened.
01:59:26.76 --> 01:59:31.84 The fears and shouts rose into the soft night to be followed by a buzz of excitement.
01:59:31.84 --> 01:59:36.44 But then the film began, and silence was restored.
01:59:36.44 --> 01:59:39.12 I arose and left the amphitheater.
01:59:39.12 --> 01:59:41.32 My heart throbbing and excitement.
01:59:41.32 --> 01:59:44.52 It was difficult to comprehend this excitement.
01:59:44.52 --> 01:59:47.56 It was a mix of thrill and pride.
01:59:47.56 --> 01:59:50.76 But predominating was the heartbeat of anxiety.
01:59:50.76 --> 01:59:56.96 For suddenly, it had been born in upon me that great events were happening.
01:59:56.96 --> 02:00:00.20 That the war was now rushing downhill to victory.
02:00:00.20 --> 02:00:07.16 And here I was, clad and pallid pajamas and robe lounging around the hospital.
02:00:07.16 --> 02:00:13.000 Yarning came upon me in a rush, and I wept herring along the dark road back to the hospital.
02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:17.40 I wanted to rejoin my comrades.
02:00:17.40 --> 02:00:21.56 Where he goes into the doctor, gentle, goes into his office.
02:00:21.56 --> 02:00:25.28 And basically they work it out.
02:00:25.28 --> 02:00:26.28 Back to the book.
02:00:26.28 --> 02:00:28.24 There's not much we can do for this trouble of yours.
02:00:28.24 --> 02:00:31.56 The hospital commander told me there's no carrying it out here.
02:00:31.56 --> 02:00:36.68 What you need is a change of climate and a less nerve-racking assignment.
02:00:36.68 --> 02:00:38.40 You're shipping me back to the state, sir.
02:00:38.40 --> 02:00:42.20 I asked he smiled wainly, ordinarily yes.
02:00:42.20 --> 02:00:46.80 Unfortunately, you Marines can't go home unless you're carried home.
02:00:46.80 --> 02:00:51.72 So we are sending you back to duty with the suggestion that you're commanding officer,
02:00:51.72 --> 02:00:54.72 have the century wake you during the night.
02:00:54.72 --> 02:01:01.16 I laughed and he laughed and Dr. Gentle laughed.
02:01:01.16 --> 02:01:03.32 Because they knew that's not something that's feasible.
02:01:03.32 --> 02:01:06.16 What they're basically saying is you're going to go back and you're just going to piss yourself
02:01:06.16 --> 02:01:07.88 and you're going to fight.
02:01:07.88 --> 02:01:10.96 And that's exactly what he wanted.
02:01:10.96 --> 02:01:18.44 Let's back there and now back to the book we left Pavu Vu.
02:01:18.44 --> 02:01:23.52 Victor's of Guadalcanal, new Britain, we went out to fight again marching into the open
02:01:23.52 --> 02:01:27.28 John landing craft, driven up on the beach.
02:01:27.28 --> 02:01:36.48 Never before where we so confident of victory never again would its price be so high.
02:01:36.48 --> 02:01:41.60 Galileo was already a Holocaust.
02:01:41.60 --> 02:01:49.84 The island flat and almost featureless was an altar being prepared for the emulation of
02:01:49.84 --> 02:01:51.68 17,000 men.
02:01:51.68 --> 02:01:58.12 So they're going on to Pella Lu.
02:01:58.12 --> 02:02:00.32 And here we go right into it.
02:02:00.32 --> 02:02:01.32 They're in their landing craft.
02:02:01.32 --> 02:02:05.32 The water began to erupt in little geysers and the air became populated with exploding
02:02:05.32 --> 02:02:06.32 steel.
02:02:06.32 --> 02:02:07.68 And me was saluting us.
02:02:07.68 --> 02:02:10.52 They were receiving us with mortar and artillery fire.
02:02:10.52 --> 02:02:13.72 10,000 Japanese awaited on the island of Pella Lu.
02:02:13.72 --> 02:02:17.000 10,000 men is brave and determined and skillful.
02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.44 As ever a garrison was since the art of warfare began.
02:02:21.44 --> 02:02:22.44 Skillful.
02:02:22.44 --> 02:02:30.60 Yes, it was a terrible rain and it did terrible work among us before we reached the beach.
02:02:30.60 --> 02:02:33.72 Our amtrak was among the first assault waves.
02:02:33.72 --> 02:02:40.16 The beach was already a litter of burning blackened and phyby and trackers of dead and wounded.
02:02:40.16 --> 02:02:44.76 A morda garden of exploding mortar shells.
02:02:44.76 --> 02:02:51.16 Holes had beer scooped in the white sand or had been blasted out by the shells.
02:02:51.16 --> 02:02:57.56 The beach was poked with holes all filled with green clad, helmeted marines.
02:02:57.56 --> 02:02:59.04 We were pinned down.
02:02:59.04 --> 02:03:01.76 We were pinned down but not by mortars alone.
02:03:01.76 --> 02:03:06.12 The machine gun fire came from an invincible outpost which the Japanese had blasted out
02:03:06.12 --> 02:03:09.52 of a coral jutting into the bay.
02:03:09.52 --> 02:03:14.08 We found an opening in it and even then we were filling it with all manners of small
02:03:14.08 --> 02:03:15.48 armed fire grenades.
02:03:15.48 --> 02:03:20.96 Sticks of dynamite hurled by men who had crept up to it or billowing fire from the flame
02:03:20.96 --> 02:03:31.76 floors who had also gained the hole but the answering fire continued to break are deadly
02:03:31.76 --> 02:03:34.32 picnic ground.
02:03:34.32 --> 02:03:40.84 And the reason for that is here for the Japanese had possessed a pebble for two decades
02:03:40.84 --> 02:03:47.56 and had blasted into the coral a network of mutually supporting caves so that so these
02:03:47.56 --> 02:03:53.08 they'd been there for twenty years preparing for this and so they've got this massive cave
02:03:53.08 --> 02:03:57.44 network and even to every time they hit one of these locations.
02:03:57.44 --> 02:04:03.44 The more guys were just pop up and they also the Japanese also had tanks on Pelaloo
02:04:03.44 --> 02:04:04.44 back to the book.
02:04:04.44 --> 02:04:07.16 Their tanks swooped in suddenly upon us.
02:04:07.16 --> 02:04:10.80 They came tearing across the airfield a dozen or so of them.
02:04:10.80 --> 02:04:11.80 It was startling.
02:04:11.80 --> 02:04:16.52 They'd come out of nowhere and here were only riflemen and machine gunners to oppose
02:04:16.52 --> 02:04:17.52 them.
02:04:17.52 --> 02:04:19.72 It was a violent outburst of gunfire.
02:04:19.72 --> 02:04:24.56 I poked my head above the crater through the lacy branch work of the scrub trees.
02:04:24.56 --> 02:04:30.44 I saw an enemy tank streaking along with snipers and camouflage hanging onto the rear.
02:04:30.44 --> 02:04:36.84 It was but a moment's glance but at the time my eye caught sight of a marine from F company
02:04:36.84 --> 02:04:42.88 a veteran running bowl leg into the rear his face writhing shouting tanks tanks and officer
02:04:42.88 --> 02:04:48.32 grabbed him and spun him around and kicked him and propelled him back to his post.
02:04:48.32 --> 02:04:54.76 In the crater we'd prepared for defense like a caravan attacked by Indians.
02:04:54.76 --> 02:04:59.72 The enemy tanks whist past their little wheels whirling within the tracks.
02:04:59.72 --> 02:05:05.68 Machine guns clattered bazookas whambed our airplanes came screeching down from heaven and
02:05:05.68 --> 02:05:11.24 they rose the detonation of their bombs and the roar of exploding tanks.
02:05:11.24 --> 02:05:16.64 To my right I saw a line of our tanks advancing firing as they came seem to stop each
02:05:16.64 --> 02:05:19.08 time their guns stuttered.
02:05:19.08 --> 02:05:26.12 Then it was over the jab tanks had been destroyed.
02:05:26.12 --> 02:05:33.16 I turned to go and as I did nearly stepped on someone's hand.
02:05:33.16 --> 02:05:40.04 Excuse me I began to say but then I saw that it was an unattached hand or rather a detached
02:05:40.04 --> 02:05:48.12 one it lay there alone open palm upwards clean capable solitary.
02:05:48.12 --> 02:05:53.64 I could not tear my eyes from it the hand is the artisan of the soul.
02:05:53.64 --> 02:06:00.76 It is the second member of the human trinity of head and hand and heart.
02:06:00.76 --> 02:06:04.76 Man has no faculty more human than his hand.
02:06:04.76 --> 02:06:13.40 More beautiful, more expressive, nor productive to see this hand lying alone as though contempt
02:06:13.40 --> 02:06:21.80 usually cast aside no longer a part of man no longer his help was to see war in all its
02:06:21.80 --> 02:06:23.96 wantiness.
02:06:23.96 --> 02:06:31.44 It was to see the especially brutal savagery of our own technique of rending.
02:06:31.44 --> 02:06:38.56 And it was to see men at their eternal worst turning upon one another tearing one another
02:06:38.56 --> 02:06:47.68 clawing at their own innards with the maniacal fury of the pride possessed.
02:06:47.68 --> 02:06:52.36 Not much I can comment on that one.
02:06:52.36 --> 02:06:56.56 Back to the book our casualties were extremely heavy.
02:06:56.56 --> 02:07:02.48 More the day was done they were total 500 in the first regiment something like 20% this on the
02:07:02.48 --> 02:07:05.000 first day.
02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:09.76 We were advancing again our objective with bloody nose ridge.
02:07:09.76 --> 02:07:17.12 This was the high ground visible from across the airfield it gave the enemy perfect observation.
02:07:17.12 --> 02:07:22.96 Advancing across the flat table of crushed coral on which there was hardly a single
02:07:22.96 --> 02:07:29.56 depression as we were easily cited as clay ducks in a shooting gallery.
02:07:29.56 --> 02:07:33.72 But there was no other route and we had to take it.
02:07:33.72 --> 02:07:38.76 Grass cutting machine gun fire swept the airfield mortars mortarshells fell with the
02:07:38.76 --> 02:07:42.64 com regularity of automation.
02:07:42.64 --> 02:07:44.48 Marines fell.
02:07:44.48 --> 02:07:45.80 They crumpled.
02:07:45.80 --> 02:07:47.16 They staggered.
02:07:47.16 --> 02:07:48.52 They pitched forward.
02:07:48.52 --> 02:07:53.80 They sank to their knees.
02:07:53.80 --> 02:07:55.12 They fell backwards.
02:07:55.12 --> 02:08:04.84 They kept advancing.
02:08:04.84 --> 02:08:08.16 The mortars had stopped.
02:08:08.16 --> 02:08:13.64 The first F company wave was advancing across the air strip running low with ranks scattered,
02:08:13.64 --> 02:08:19.52 resting a withering machine gun fire that had been going to break the runway.
02:08:19.52 --> 02:08:20.68 They were falling.
02:08:20.68 --> 02:08:22.68 It seemed unreal.
02:08:22.68 --> 02:08:28.96 It seemed a tabloat like a scene from a motion picture.
02:08:28.96 --> 02:08:34.10 It required an effort of mine to recall that these were flesh and blood Marines men who
02:08:34.10 --> 02:08:39.08 my new, whose lives were linked with mine.
02:08:39.08 --> 02:08:47.36 The bill mort was required in facing up to the fact that my turn was next.
02:08:47.36 --> 02:08:52.36 Here is the point in battle where one needs the rallying cry.
02:08:52.36 --> 02:08:56.42 Here where the banner must be unfurled or the song song where the name of the cause
02:08:56.42 --> 02:08:58.76 flung at the enemy like a challenge.
02:08:58.76 --> 02:09:01.40 Here is the mounted charge.
02:09:01.40 --> 02:09:07.24 The thing is old as warfare itself that either overwhelms the defense and wins the battle
02:09:07.24 --> 02:09:11.88 or is broken and brings on defeat.
02:09:11.88 --> 02:09:16.88 How much less for bidding might have been that avenue of death that I was about to cross
02:09:16.88 --> 02:09:25.76 had there been some holy irrational shout like Viva Lampur or the Marine Corps forever
02:09:25.76 --> 02:09:36.000 rather than that educated voice which in a saying Freud that was at all odds with the event
02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:42.32 said well it's art or now.
02:09:42.32 --> 02:09:44.12 So you're going to get.
02:09:44.12 --> 02:09:45.12 That's all you're going to get.
02:09:45.12 --> 02:09:49.76 These Marines are getting teleport by machine gun fire by morgur.
02:09:49.76 --> 02:09:51.60 They're getting teleport Marines are falling left and right.
02:09:51.60 --> 02:09:55.64 They're continuing to advance.
02:09:55.64 --> 02:10:01.26 They're continuing to advance and he's watching this group go across this airfield getting
02:10:01.26 --> 02:10:12.54 mode down he wants some kind of motivation and what does he get?
02:10:12.54 --> 02:10:15.86 Well it's our turn now.
02:10:15.86 --> 02:10:17.18 Crazy.
02:10:17.18 --> 02:10:19.74 I bade goodbye to the artist.
02:10:19.74 --> 02:10:22.42 He looked at me sadly from beneath his helmet.
02:10:22.42 --> 02:10:26.26 His face made darker and more angular by its shadow.
02:10:26.26 --> 02:10:31.66 He cast a roof or a glance in the direction of the air strip and the still falling
02:10:31.66 --> 02:10:33.66 men.
02:10:33.66 --> 02:10:35.10 Good luck kid.
02:10:35.10 --> 02:10:38.34 He said and turned away.
02:10:38.34 --> 02:10:40.34 I began to run.
02:10:40.34 --> 02:10:42.14 The heat rose and stifling waves.
02:10:42.14 --> 02:10:45.26 The bullet whispered at times at other times they were not audible.
02:10:45.26 --> 02:10:50.90 I ran with my head low my helmet bumping crazily to obscure my view like waves rising
02:10:50.90 --> 02:10:54.14 around a small ship.
02:10:54.14 --> 02:11:00.06 In a moment I could not see Lieutenant Deep Chest or filthy Fred.
02:11:00.06 --> 02:11:01.86 I was alone in running.
02:11:01.86 --> 02:11:05.10 There were men to my left still falling.
02:11:05.10 --> 02:11:10.86 I ran and threw myself down caught my breath rose again and ran again suddenly I ran
02:11:10.86 --> 02:11:15.86 into a shell crater full of men and I stopped running.
02:11:15.86 --> 02:11:21.14 So the only cover that they have is a shell crater and he dives into this shell crater and
02:11:21.14 --> 02:11:25.62 there are 10 guys are so in there.
02:11:25.62 --> 02:11:30.34 And one of them he's called this one guy walkie talkie back to the book walkie talkie
02:11:30.34 --> 02:11:32.42 sat below me on the crater floor.
02:11:32.42 --> 02:11:35.82 He hunched his shoulders toward me and asked me to twirl certain giles.
02:11:35.82 --> 02:11:39.26 I did but he could not seem to get through.
02:11:39.26 --> 02:11:41.06 That came the screech of a shell.
02:11:41.06 --> 02:11:45.18 I braised my back for it even though I knew that the ones you hear are not the ones
02:11:45.18 --> 02:11:48.06 to be feared.
02:11:48.06 --> 02:11:56.86 That how fear the one that gets you, the one you do not hear.
02:11:56.86 --> 02:11:59.42 Another voice was audible now.
02:11:59.42 --> 02:12:05.30 The fifth Marines lieutenant who was wounded, who was in fact dying as I learned later
02:12:05.30 --> 02:12:11.70 was speaking by walkie talkie to his regimental commander.
02:12:11.70 --> 02:12:15.02 The glorious fifth Marines have gone through sir.
02:12:15.02 --> 02:12:19.82 You were saying and have achieved the objective.
02:12:19.82 --> 02:12:31.42 We are now in contact with the first regiment.
02:12:31.42 --> 02:12:41.26 Now there's 10 guys in there and finally one of the captains speaks up.
02:12:41.26 --> 02:12:44.98 How many men here from the first Marines he asked?
02:12:44.98 --> 02:12:46.98 We raised our hands.
02:12:46.98 --> 02:12:49.38 Six A, that ought to be enough.
02:12:49.38 --> 02:12:51.82 We better take that blockhouse over there.
02:12:51.82 --> 02:12:54.02 That's where all the machine gun fire seems to be coming from.
02:12:54.02 --> 02:12:58.90 As soon as this shell fire stops, we'll move out against it.
02:12:58.90 --> 02:13:00.50 Just like that.
02:13:00.50 --> 02:13:04.14 The blockhouse had resisted even naval gunfire.
02:13:04.14 --> 02:13:08.82 It had taken bombs, point blank, and remained standing.
02:13:08.82 --> 02:13:12.22 It was obviously covered by a maze of pill boxes.
02:13:12.22 --> 02:13:16.22 We six of us were to take it.
02:13:16.22 --> 02:13:22.66 The captain might be stupid, but no one could say that he was not gallant.
02:13:22.66 --> 02:13:29.50 I felt disgusted and resigned myself to an unprofitable death.
02:13:29.50 --> 02:13:35.90 I looked at the men from the fifth who were regarding us with wonder and envy them for having
02:13:35.90 --> 02:13:42.50 retained diplomatic relations with the state of sanity.
02:13:42.50 --> 02:13:47.98 Their commander was hardly conscious now, but he had heard.
02:13:47.98 --> 02:13:53.18 He waved a hand weekly in our direction and grinned as though to say, you'll never make
02:13:53.18 --> 02:13:57.50 it, but there's no harm in trying.
02:13:57.50 --> 02:14:03.46 And of course to a dying man, I suppose there was no harm.
02:14:03.46 --> 02:14:10.30 So, do you think they're going to do it?
02:14:10.30 --> 02:14:11.30 Yep, they're going to do it.
02:14:11.30 --> 02:14:12.62 They're going to charge this blockhouse.
02:14:12.62 --> 02:14:13.62 Six guys, this blockhouse.
02:14:13.62 --> 02:14:17.70 There's just concrete blockhouse, massive machine gunfire coming from it.
02:14:17.70 --> 02:14:19.34 They're going to charge this thing.
02:14:19.34 --> 02:14:21.34 That took bombs, straight up.
02:14:21.34 --> 02:14:25.78 That took direct hits from bombs.
02:14:25.78 --> 02:14:27.34 They make a run for it.
02:14:27.34 --> 02:14:28.34 Back to the book.
02:14:28.34 --> 02:14:30.58 The shells drove us back to our crater.
02:14:30.58 --> 02:14:33.58 Once again, walkie-talkie had difficulty with the apparatus.
02:14:33.58 --> 02:14:37.18 He could receive, but not send, but Italian was asking for positions.
02:14:37.18 --> 02:14:39.46 You better report back to command post.
02:14:39.46 --> 02:14:42.90 Captain said to me, but come back out.
02:14:42.90 --> 02:14:48.34 So lucky wants to go tell command post what's going on.
02:14:48.34 --> 02:14:49.82 He, imagine.
02:14:49.82 --> 02:14:51.26 There's just machine gunfire.
02:14:51.26 --> 02:14:52.26 Mortar's going off everywhere.
02:14:52.26 --> 02:14:53.70 He runs back.
02:14:53.70 --> 02:14:56.46 He gets back to the major.
02:14:56.46 --> 02:14:57.90 At the command post.
02:14:57.90 --> 02:14:59.26 How is it out there, Lucky?
02:14:59.26 --> 02:15:00.50 The major asked.
02:15:00.50 --> 02:15:03.70 Bad sir, I said, adding nothing.
02:15:03.70 --> 02:15:08.34 For my notion of this battle, we'll still confuse jumble of men and movement and explosions
02:15:08.34 --> 02:15:13.78 in which blistering hot, when which a blistering hot airfield was somehow involved.
02:15:13.78 --> 02:15:17.86 Then I rose and said, I better get back out.
02:15:17.86 --> 02:15:19.70 The major nodded and waved.
02:15:19.70 --> 02:15:20.14 Good luck.
02:15:20.14 --> 02:15:28.82 I took firm hold of my Tommy gun and adjusted my pack secured my map case and circle the
02:15:28.82 --> 02:15:32.66 pile of shell casings to return to the shell greater.
02:15:32.66 --> 02:15:34.74 It was my last warlike act.
02:15:34.74 --> 02:15:39.06 For the last time, I set my face toward the enemy.
02:15:39.06 --> 02:15:42.06 About a hundred yards out, a shell exploded in front of me.
02:15:42.06 --> 02:15:43.22 I veered to the right.
02:15:43.22 --> 02:15:45.02 Another shell exploded in front of me.
02:15:45.02 --> 02:15:46.02 I veered more.
02:15:46.02 --> 02:15:47.02 Another shell.
02:15:47.02 --> 02:15:48.54 Another, but closer.
02:15:48.54 --> 02:15:49.54 Four more.
02:15:49.54 --> 02:15:50.54 Another closer still.
02:15:50.54 --> 02:15:52.10 I halted.
02:15:52.10 --> 02:15:54.26 A horrifying fact became clear.
02:15:54.26 --> 02:15:58.06 I had inserted myself between the enemy artillery and their target.
02:15:58.06 --> 02:16:03.66 They were hunting something, perhaps the ammunition dumped behind me and were walking their
02:16:03.66 --> 02:16:07.02 fire in its direction.
02:16:07.02 --> 02:16:08.22 There was no cover.
02:16:08.22 --> 02:16:09.94 To go forward was the die.
02:16:09.94 --> 02:16:14.42 I could only run away from this approaching death, hoping to get out of the target area
02:16:14.42 --> 02:16:15.66 before it caught me.
02:16:15.66 --> 02:16:18.46 I turned and ran.
02:16:18.46 --> 02:16:22.86 I ran with the heat shimmering in waves of, from the coral, with the sweat oiling
02:16:22.86 --> 02:16:27.74 my joints and the fear drying my mouth, with the shells exploding behind me, closer
02:16:27.74 --> 02:16:33.22 ever closer, the airfield, the air filled with the angry voices of shrapnel demanding
02:16:33.22 --> 02:16:35.74 my life.
02:16:35.74 --> 02:16:40.98 I ran with an image in my mind of the Japanese gunner atop his ridge, bringing each
02:16:40.98 --> 02:16:44.86 burst, carefully closer to my flying rear.
02:16:44.86 --> 02:16:50.34 Chasing me across that baking table in a monstrous game of cat and mouse, gleeful at each
02:16:50.34 --> 02:16:54.90 greater burst of speed called forth by a closer explosion.
02:16:54.90 --> 02:17:00.18 And then tiring of sport lifting the gun and dropping one before me.
02:17:00.18 --> 02:17:06.62 A shell landed alongside me, perhaps five feet away, but it did not explode or at least
02:17:06.62 --> 02:17:11.22 I do not think it did, one cannot be certain at such time.
02:17:11.22 --> 02:17:15.06 There is a different space in time with fear.
02:17:15.06 --> 02:17:19.82 But there was a shell at two foot blob of burning red, which struck the coral with a thunder
02:17:19.82 --> 02:17:25.06 flap and seemed to glance off into the air and go wailing away into the bay, with that
02:17:25.06 --> 02:17:31.58 I called upon my remaining strength, and also then the Japanese gunner hit his target.
02:17:31.58 --> 02:17:34.74 The ammunition dump was hit.
02:17:34.74 --> 02:17:41.54 The war ended for me, I had been shattered, no good, a dry husk.
02:17:41.54 --> 02:17:48.78 Modern war had had me, a giant lemon squeezer had crushed me dry, concussion, heat,
02:17:48.78 --> 02:17:54.78 thirst, tension, all had had their way with me.
02:17:54.78 --> 02:17:59.66 I must have stumbled about, unable to speak until at last I sank my knees beside two
02:17:59.66 --> 02:18:02.70 men scratching a foxhole in the sand.
02:18:02.70 --> 02:18:04.74 They were startled.
02:18:04.74 --> 02:18:08.70 As no from afar I could hear them discussing me.
02:18:08.70 --> 02:18:11.54 He can't think what he thinks the matter with him.
02:18:11.54 --> 02:18:14.74 Search me, he don't look wounded, maybe he got a near miss.
02:18:14.74 --> 02:18:16.42 Hey, fella, what's wrong with you?
02:18:16.42 --> 02:18:18.74 Can't you say something?
02:18:18.74 --> 02:18:22.58 What do you think we ought to do with him?
02:18:22.58 --> 02:18:27.14 They rose and pulled me erect, got a shoulder a piece beneath my armpits and dragged me
02:18:27.14 --> 02:18:29.66 like a dummy through the sand.
02:18:29.66 --> 02:18:37.06 Like a life-sized doll in whom the spring had been broken, they dragged me to the doctor.
02:18:37.06 --> 02:18:39.98 A corpsman laid me on the blanket, tied a ticket to me.
02:18:39.98 --> 02:18:44.86 He thrust a needle into my arm, which was attached, a running hose to a bottle of liquid
02:18:44.86 --> 02:18:49.18 suspended upside down on a fray on a wire frame.
02:18:49.18 --> 02:18:52.78 The pair who had brought me, crouched beside me, what's wrong with him, Doc?
02:18:52.78 --> 02:18:53.78 One of the masked.
02:18:53.78 --> 02:18:55.78 I don't know the corpsman answered.
02:18:55.78 --> 02:18:58.54 He's pretty beat up though, blast concussion.
02:18:58.54 --> 02:19:01.98 I'm sending him back to the hospital ship.
02:19:01.98 --> 02:19:05.06 One of the pair looked longingly at the Tommy gun beside me.
02:19:05.06 --> 02:19:07.30 His glance seemed to say you won't need that anymore.
02:19:07.30 --> 02:19:10.46 I told him with my eyes to take it.
02:19:10.46 --> 02:19:13.90 And he slung it over his shoulder with immense satisfaction.
02:19:13.90 --> 02:19:14.90 And they left.
02:19:14.90 --> 02:19:17.66 They had their reward.
02:19:17.66 --> 02:19:21.82 Mortars were falling as they carried me onto the beach with about a half a dozen other casualties.
02:19:21.82 --> 02:19:27.50 We lay there and I wonder, dolly, if the jab gunners were to catch me after all.
02:19:27.50 --> 02:19:32.82 At last, the landing boat took a subordinate reward off for the ship.
02:19:32.82 --> 02:19:35.54 I began to feel shame.
02:19:35.54 --> 02:19:41.62 The others were badly wounded, some put out of pain by morphine and hear I lay in a corner
02:19:41.62 --> 02:19:50.02 quietly wretched like a frightened kitten intact my face on blemished my bones unbroken.
02:19:50.02 --> 02:19:52.66 The war was ending.
02:19:52.66 --> 02:19:55.10 I was ashamed.
02:19:55.10 --> 02:20:01.54 My spirit crept away from the eyes staring, from the staring eyes that fast, fastened
02:20:01.54 --> 02:20:05.90 upon us as the boat was drawn up out of the water to the deck.
02:20:05.90 --> 02:20:10.42 People in white coats throng the rail and two of these at the center gazed with authority
02:20:10.42 --> 02:20:15.26 into the boat searching for the wounded most in need of aid.
02:20:15.26 --> 02:20:22.18 I shrank from that expert stare when suddenly one of them pointed at me and said, him, get
02:20:22.18 --> 02:20:25.22 him downstairs right away.
02:20:25.22 --> 02:20:29.98 They grasped me, stripping me naked as they did and hurried me down a ladder, laying
02:20:29.98 --> 02:20:34.82 me on a table and again frusting a needle into my arm.
02:20:34.82 --> 02:20:39.58 With the liquid flowing into my body came the warm flood of returning self-respect, the
02:20:39.58 --> 02:20:46.26 dull, disperting shame had have disappeared the moment that pointing finger singled me out.
02:20:46.26 --> 02:20:47.82 I had been hurt.
02:20:47.82 --> 02:20:50.06 I wasn't need of aid.
02:20:50.06 --> 02:20:55.58 With a healing power of which he had no inkling, the doctor had restored my spirit to
02:20:55.58 --> 02:20:58.74 me.
02:20:58.74 --> 02:21:01.98 So the war ended for me.
02:21:01.98 --> 02:21:06.94 Each day for a week I ascended the ladder to the deck and gazed in more bed fascination
02:21:06.94 --> 02:21:10.46 that pellu and myel are so away.
02:21:10.46 --> 02:21:12.42 They were still fighting.
02:21:12.42 --> 02:21:16.94 One could hear the sound of the firing.
02:21:16.94 --> 02:21:19.54 Each day the news was bad.
02:21:19.54 --> 02:21:22.14 We were winning.
02:21:22.14 --> 02:21:27.54 But at a fearful price.
02:21:27.54 --> 02:21:31.46 And then the battle had been won.
02:21:31.46 --> 02:21:37.06 The nation had come to the Japanese 10,000 on pellu and my regimen, the first was licking
02:21:37.06 --> 02:21:40.38 its wound wounds on the beach.
02:21:40.38 --> 02:21:48.98 Of my battalion, a force of some 1500 men, the remained but 28 affectives when the command
02:21:48.98 --> 02:21:54.82 came for the last assault on that honeycomb of caves and pillboxes which the Japanese had
02:21:54.82 --> 02:21:57.94 carved into bloody nose ridge.
02:21:57.94 --> 02:22:07.34 In men and blood and agony, the most costly spit of land in the wide Pacific.
02:22:07.34 --> 02:22:18.78 When the command came, they rose from their holes like shades from sepultures and advanced.
02:22:18.78 --> 02:22:20.14 They could not run.
02:22:20.14 --> 02:22:24.90 They could barely walk and they dragged their weapons.
02:22:24.90 --> 02:22:31.38 They obeyed and they attacked.
02:22:31.38 --> 02:22:40.34 They were taken from the line on the brink of collapse.
02:22:40.34 --> 02:22:43.02 Ruffaford was killed.
02:22:43.02 --> 02:22:49.82 He'd been hit by a mortar shell and blown a bit white man had been killed.
02:22:49.82 --> 02:22:59.74 In the artist, the artist was dead, a brave man may he rest in peace.
02:22:59.74 --> 02:23:06.82 Captain Dreadnaut fell dead of a sniper's bullet.
02:23:06.82 --> 02:23:13.26 It had become a hall cost in the fullest sense.
02:23:13.26 --> 02:23:19.06 Scores of others in the battalion sparrished.
02:23:19.06 --> 02:23:24.06 Over those that have not been mentioned in this book, friends who did not fit the narrative,
02:23:24.06 --> 02:23:31.74 men whose faces I have not forgotten and whose bravery and sacrifice has deposited a vast
02:23:31.74 --> 02:23:37.62 spiritual credit for our nation to draw upon.
02:23:37.62 --> 02:23:49.38 These two fell wrestling that island rock from the grasp of its most tenacious defender.
02:23:49.38 --> 02:24:00.78 May they rest in peace.
02:24:00.78 --> 02:24:09.02 Sacrifice says, not the blood of your brother, my friend.
02:24:09.02 --> 02:24:14.14 Your blood.
02:24:14.14 --> 02:24:18.10 That is why women weep when their men go off to war.
02:24:18.10 --> 02:24:22.18 They do not weep for their victims.
02:24:22.18 --> 02:24:28.22 They weep for them as victim.
02:24:28.22 --> 02:24:39.46 That is why with the immemorial insight of mankind, there are gay songs and colorful bands
02:24:39.46 --> 02:24:52.66 to send them off to fortify their failing hearts, not to quicken their lust for blood.
02:24:52.66 --> 02:24:57.70 That is why there are no glorious living.
02:24:57.70 --> 02:25:10.74 That only glorious dead heroes turn traitor warriors age and gross soft, but a victim
02:25:10.74 --> 02:25:28.74 has changed less.
02:25:28.74 --> 02:25:43.62 Sacrifice is eternal.
02:25:43.62 --> 02:25:49.26 And I'll close with the book there.
02:25:49.26 --> 02:25:58.42 Obviously it's an incredible book about incredible men.
02:25:58.42 --> 02:26:10.74 And their eternal sacrifice.
02:26:10.74 --> 02:26:15.18 And it's so humbling to hear of their sacrifice.
02:26:15.18 --> 02:26:18.74 And I say it over and over and over again.
02:26:18.74 --> 02:26:23.78 And I will continue to say that we must live lives worthy of their sacrifice.
02:26:23.78 --> 02:26:41.46 The 7D-100 killed at Guadalcanal, the 2,336 killed at Pelaloo.
02:26:41.46 --> 02:26:50.74 And all the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who as Robert Lecky said later in his life
02:26:50.74 --> 02:26:57.74 who fought or who foremost fighting.
02:26:57.74 --> 02:27:05.14 Phil.
02:27:05.14 --> 02:27:13.06 And I think it's also important to remember the example of Robert Lecky who by his own admission
02:27:13.06 --> 02:27:17.18 was no angel.
02:27:17.18 --> 02:27:27.74 So plaster saint, but who is truly a hero.
02:27:27.74 --> 02:27:33.94 And remember that that people all people have good and bad qualities.
02:27:33.94 --> 02:27:41.06 And people make mistakes and they do dumb things and get those very people are capable
02:27:41.06 --> 02:27:48.06 of so much.
02:27:48.06 --> 02:28:07.18 And yet so often we judge, we judge and we judge and we judge and we cast stones.
02:28:07.18 --> 02:28:13.98 But who are we to judge?
02:28:13.98 --> 02:28:19.50 Who are we to judge when a man like Robert Lecky?
02:28:19.50 --> 02:28:23.22 Lecky Lecky.
02:28:23.22 --> 02:28:31.02 Who not only drank to access and chase girls and pulled up pistol on his superior officer
02:28:31.02 --> 02:28:35.78 and who got so nervous.
02:28:35.78 --> 02:28:36.78 So scared.
02:28:36.78 --> 02:28:43.42 Yes, I'm going to call it scared who got so scared that he would lose control of his
02:28:43.42 --> 02:28:48.70 bladder every time he went to sleep.
02:28:48.70 --> 02:28:56.38 And yet he overcame that fear with more bravery in his heart than most of us can even
02:28:56.38 --> 02:29:06.70 fathom.
02:29:06.70 --> 02:29:09.34 So who are we to judge?
02:29:09.34 --> 02:29:16.26 We shouldn't judge people, we should help them.
02:29:16.26 --> 02:29:26.34 Then there's probably nothing more we can do to live a worthwhile life than to help people.
02:29:26.34 --> 02:29:37.58 To help other people and in helping other people I promise you will be rewarded and you
02:29:37.58 --> 02:29:46.30 will be helping yourself too.
02:29:46.30 --> 02:29:52.70 And one more thing that we see in this book once again is the strength of human will.
02:29:52.70 --> 02:30:06.58 We see men tested beyond anything we can imagine.
02:30:06.58 --> 02:30:17.30 And then when they pass that test one time they get given that test again and then again
02:30:17.30 --> 02:30:22.66 and still they overcome.
02:30:22.66 --> 02:30:31.94 Overcome the pain and the suffering and the fear.
02:30:31.94 --> 02:30:34.50 And yet we can't get ourselves out of bed in the morning.
02:30:34.50 --> 02:30:39.54 We can't move toward a goal we've set for ourselves.
02:30:39.54 --> 02:30:48.42 Don't allow that.
02:30:48.42 --> 02:30:56.46 Remember the tender who river remember the airfield at Guadalcanal remember the discipline
02:30:56.46 --> 02:31:04.34 instilled in every marine at Paris Island.
02:31:04.34 --> 02:31:17.42 And remember what you remember what you are capable of if you mobilize your will.
02:31:17.42 --> 02:31:24.22 And if you keep moving forward you keep advancing.
02:31:24.22 --> 02:31:33.58 Remember what you are capable of if you keep attacking and keeping attacking and keep attacking
02:31:33.58 --> 02:31:41.54 and don't stop.
02:31:41.54 --> 02:31:58.18 Don't stop moving forward and don't stop attacking and don't succumb to the suffering
02:31:58.18 --> 02:32:03.58 and the pain and the fear don't succumb.
02:32:03.58 --> 02:32:17.30 But instead move forward and attack.
02:32:17.30 --> 02:32:25.50 And I think that's all I've got for tonight.
02:32:25.50 --> 02:32:27.54 So echo Charles.
02:32:27.54 --> 02:32:28.54 Yes.
02:32:28.54 --> 02:32:33.78 I'm over here doing a little decompression.
02:32:33.78 --> 02:32:42.46 Maybe you could mobilize your will to let people know how to support this podcast or
02:32:42.46 --> 02:32:43.46 stuff.
02:32:43.46 --> 02:32:47.26 I will make the disclaimer it doesn't take much will to do this.
02:32:47.26 --> 02:32:51.26 But I do see it as a time to decompress a little bit.
02:32:51.26 --> 02:32:53.26 Bro, seriously.
02:32:53.26 --> 02:32:54.26 Yeah.
02:32:54.26 --> 02:32:56.26 Can you even imagine?
02:32:56.26 --> 02:32:58.82 Again, getting tested over and over again.
02:32:58.82 --> 02:33:03.02 You're going through the hardest possible tests with dysentery and a hernia.
02:33:03.02 --> 02:33:08.58 With dysentery, a hernia, you're pissing yourself, your friends are getting killed.
02:33:08.58 --> 02:33:11.26 You pass that test through some miracle.
02:33:11.26 --> 02:33:13.18 And then like, yeah, you got another test.
02:33:13.18 --> 02:33:14.18 Right.
02:33:14.18 --> 02:33:15.18 Yeah.
02:33:15.18 --> 02:33:18.50 But to prepare you for the test we're going to make you suffer more.
02:33:18.50 --> 02:33:20.98 And then you get tested again.
02:33:20.98 --> 02:33:21.98 That's cool.
02:33:21.98 --> 02:33:22.98 But does not doesn't matter.
02:33:22.98 --> 02:33:23.98 It's not the final exam.
02:33:23.98 --> 02:33:26.22 You're going to do it again.
02:33:26.22 --> 02:33:28.38 And again, I say this all the time.
02:33:28.38 --> 02:33:34.26 This is thousands and thousands and thousands of people did this.
02:33:34.26 --> 02:33:37.94 That's what's important to remember.
02:33:37.94 --> 02:33:39.70 This isn't this is a civilian.
02:33:39.70 --> 02:33:40.94 This guy was a civilian.
02:33:40.94 --> 02:33:41.94 Yeah.
02:33:41.94 --> 02:33:43.10 It sounds like this crazy extreme.
02:33:43.10 --> 02:33:44.10 No.
02:33:44.10 --> 02:33:45.10 This is all the cases.
02:33:45.10 --> 02:33:46.10 Yes.
02:33:46.10 --> 02:33:47.74 This is all the cases.
02:33:47.74 --> 02:33:48.74 This is all the cases.
02:33:48.74 --> 02:33:51.54 He talks about he says, look, courage was common.
02:33:51.54 --> 02:33:55.06 There was a rare case where we'd get touched by this fear and it would overtake guys
02:33:55.06 --> 02:33:56.06 and we'd.
02:33:56.06 --> 02:33:57.50 All storm back up the best we could.
02:33:57.50 --> 02:33:59.94 But this isn't an anomaly.
02:33:59.94 --> 02:34:03.06 This isn't the story of the singular hero.
02:34:03.06 --> 02:34:04.22 Right.
02:34:04.22 --> 02:34:07.10 This is the story of thousands and thousands of heroes.
02:34:07.10 --> 02:34:09.46 And this is the story of what people are capable of.
02:34:09.46 --> 02:34:11.10 People are capable of this.
02:34:11.10 --> 02:34:12.74 It's proven.
02:34:12.74 --> 02:34:17.42 And when you think you can't take any more guess what you can.
02:34:17.42 --> 02:34:18.62 Amazing.
02:34:18.62 --> 02:34:19.62 Amazing.
02:34:19.62 --> 02:34:22.62 You know.
02:34:22.62 --> 02:34:26.02 Well, if I got disinterested,
02:34:26.02 --> 02:34:28.26 I wouldn't get out of bed straight up.
02:34:28.26 --> 02:34:31.26 Don't let alone all this other stuff.
02:34:31.26 --> 02:34:32.06 Yeah, I mean, bed.
02:34:32.06 --> 02:34:33.86 Maybe I'd go to the hospital or something like that.
02:34:33.86 --> 02:34:35.46 But then I'd go to hospital.
02:34:35.46 --> 02:34:42.10 Even echo Charles could employ the will in carry on with this entry.
02:34:42.10 --> 02:34:43.10 Yeah.
02:34:43.10 --> 02:34:44.94 I even say you got malaria too, by the way.
02:34:44.94 --> 02:34:47.38 You know, just think of my foot as a friend.
02:34:47.38 --> 02:34:48.38 He got it too.
02:34:48.38 --> 02:34:50.66 This friend got malaria, but he got malaria too.
02:34:50.66 --> 02:34:51.66 Got it.
02:34:51.66 --> 02:34:52.94 That's when they went to look at his hernia.
02:34:52.94 --> 02:34:54.14 They're like, hey, you got to go back to front.
02:34:54.14 --> 02:34:55.14 Oh, but you got malaria.
02:34:55.14 --> 02:34:57.38 Just suffer through that for whatever it is.
02:34:57.38 --> 02:34:58.38 Yeah.
02:34:58.38 --> 02:34:59.38 And that's four days.
02:34:59.38 --> 02:35:00.38 Okay, now you can go back.
02:35:00.38 --> 02:35:01.38 Okay.
02:35:01.38 --> 02:35:02.38 Okay, you're good now.
02:35:02.38 --> 02:35:03.38 Okay.
02:35:03.38 --> 02:35:05.18 Guys, you're just unbelievable.
02:35:05.18 --> 02:35:06.18 I'm trying.
02:35:06.18 --> 02:35:07.18 All right.
02:35:07.18 --> 02:35:10.86 Well, I feel like we should talk about on it then.
02:35:10.86 --> 02:35:14.18 No, that sounds like a great thing to talk about.
02:35:14.18 --> 02:35:15.18 I'll let you talk about it.
02:35:15.18 --> 02:35:17.22 I'm going to sit over here and decompress.
02:35:17.22 --> 02:35:19.22 Well, okay.
02:35:19.22 --> 02:35:23.82 So I'm really glad I'm just kind of goes without saying, but I'm going to say it.
02:35:23.82 --> 02:35:27.18 So I'm glad that we kind of got aligned.
02:35:27.18 --> 02:35:31.54 Well, I mean, I already took shrimp tech before this, but actually, I get technically
02:35:31.54 --> 02:35:34.86 it was you who really made me take krill oil.
02:35:34.86 --> 02:35:36.58 I didn't make you.
02:35:36.58 --> 02:35:41.58 Yeah, but you let's say you influenced me enough to actually take action.
02:35:41.58 --> 02:35:49.18 As they said, but anyway, so it's like kind of I compare like the post krill oil and
02:35:49.18 --> 02:35:52.54 the pre-cruel oil situation.
02:35:52.54 --> 02:35:55.30 So I was, you know, I was into lifting weights and stuff.
02:35:55.30 --> 02:36:00.78 And you know how like weights is a good kind of weights is cool because you know how strong
02:36:00.78 --> 02:36:01.78 you are kind of thing.
02:36:01.78 --> 02:36:02.78 You know, there's a lot of it.
02:36:02.78 --> 02:36:04.26 Yeah, it's pretty black and white.
02:36:04.26 --> 02:36:05.26 There's the number.
02:36:05.26 --> 02:36:09.18 So you can kind of judge like, yeah, this guy's strong or I'm stronger.
02:36:09.18 --> 02:36:10.18 I'm not strong or whatever.
02:36:10.18 --> 02:36:11.18 Right?
02:36:11.18 --> 02:36:13.54 So I considered myself pretty strong in the weight room.
02:36:13.54 --> 02:36:18.14 But, okay, this one time one of our friends came into town, we have, you know, we have
02:36:18.14 --> 02:36:20.62 the weights at the outside and stuff.
02:36:20.62 --> 02:36:23.62 And they're like, oh yeah, you got the weights.
02:36:23.62 --> 02:36:28.78 So he gets under there and he grabs away not heavy, but he grabs them and I'm thinking
02:36:28.78 --> 02:36:31.82 in my head, like, I can do way more than that.
02:36:31.82 --> 02:36:35.62 But then I was like, I can, but I have to warm up a lot first.
02:36:35.62 --> 02:36:37.66 You know, because it's really how strong am I?
02:36:37.66 --> 02:36:38.66 You know, really?
02:36:38.66 --> 02:36:44.06 Anyway, the point there is that was pre-cruel oil.
02:36:44.06 --> 02:36:46.62 I'm not saying I could jump underneath my max.
02:36:46.62 --> 02:36:48.02 No, I'm not saying that.
02:36:48.02 --> 02:36:55.02 I'm saying like my actual strength is closer to my no, non-warm-up strength.
02:36:55.02 --> 02:36:56.02 No.
02:36:56.02 --> 02:36:57.02 That's a good thing.
02:36:57.02 --> 02:36:59.02 You ever seen those videos?
02:36:59.02 --> 02:37:00.02 Where?
02:37:00.02 --> 02:37:01.02 Probably not.
02:37:01.02 --> 02:37:02.02 But go ahead.
02:37:02.02 --> 02:37:03.02 I don't know.
02:37:03.02 --> 02:37:09.02 You remember when they dress up the young professional basketball player or something?
02:37:09.02 --> 02:37:11.02 Oh, it's like under.
02:37:11.02 --> 02:37:12.02 And there's no an old man.
02:37:12.02 --> 02:37:13.02 Oh, yeah.
02:37:13.02 --> 02:37:14.02 Yeah.
02:37:14.02 --> 02:37:15.02 So there's this one.
02:37:15.02 --> 02:37:19.02 I think he's like a pro-crossfit guy or a pro-weight little Olympic lifter or something.
02:37:19.02 --> 02:37:22.02 So he goes to his beaches this whole man.
02:37:22.02 --> 02:37:24.02 And he says, hey, you guys are strong and stuff like that.
02:37:24.02 --> 02:37:27.02 I think he kind of overduzz it in my opinion with acting, but whatever.
02:37:27.02 --> 02:37:31.02 And everyone's believing like, oh, this old man, you know, he probably used to be a weight lifter.
02:37:31.02 --> 02:37:35.02 And he, and he gets under the weight and he's just killing.
02:37:35.02 --> 02:37:36.02 He's in Barry.
02:37:36.02 --> 02:37:38.02 He's just showing up all the guys.
02:37:38.02 --> 02:37:39.02 Beating them.
02:37:39.02 --> 02:37:40.02 You know, lifting them always.
02:37:40.02 --> 02:37:41.02 Then them and whatnot.
02:37:41.02 --> 02:37:44.02 So then he kind of like does his old man walk away.
02:37:44.02 --> 02:37:48.02 That's how I felt before the cruel oil.
02:37:48.02 --> 02:37:57.02 When it's time to lift like I could lift a lot, but like every day life on my kind of stiff, you know, like, I got to like get up after all, you know.
02:37:57.02 --> 02:37:58.02 That's it.
02:37:58.02 --> 02:38:02.02 That's the cruel, cruel oil comparison speech.
02:38:02.02 --> 02:38:05.02 And where would you recommend people get the cruel oil that you speak of so highly?
02:38:05.02 --> 02:38:07.02 Anyway, on it.
02:38:07.02 --> 02:38:10.02 But he, and I looked into that.
02:38:10.02 --> 02:38:14.02 And I'm like, all my prompts lead towards closure.
02:38:14.02 --> 02:38:15.02 Yeah, my goal.
02:38:15.02 --> 02:38:16.02 Yeah, sure.
02:38:16.02 --> 02:38:20.02 No, but I'm saying like, you know, you know, you don't care about my goal.
02:38:20.02 --> 02:38:21.02 You get your own goal.
02:38:21.02 --> 02:38:22.02 Yes, stories to tell.
02:38:22.02 --> 02:38:24.02 Yeah, thanks people want to hear about.
02:38:24.02 --> 02:38:29.02 But I think when I saw those videos, I was like, that was me before a crew.
02:38:29.02 --> 02:38:31.02 Or I really thought that like, well, that's how it feels.
02:38:31.02 --> 02:38:34.02 You know, kind of find it's a funny video to funny thought even really.
02:38:34.02 --> 02:38:35.02 But that's kind of how it feels.
02:38:35.02 --> 02:38:37.02 But I have that problem meeting more.
02:38:37.02 --> 02:38:38.02 You know, I don't feel like that anymore.
02:38:38.02 --> 02:38:43.02 So if someone has seen that video and they might be feeling that that way,
02:38:43.02 --> 02:38:44.02 maybe I can solve it.
02:38:44.02 --> 02:38:46.02 I wish I knew that long time ago.
02:38:46.02 --> 02:38:49.02 Anyway, looked into strong bone.
02:38:49.02 --> 02:38:52.02 Remember we were talking about it last week or whatever.
02:38:52.02 --> 02:38:54.02 And I was like, hey, does it make your bones?
02:38:54.02 --> 02:38:55.02 I gave you a strong moment.
02:38:55.02 --> 02:38:56.02 We had kind of did it.
02:38:56.02 --> 02:38:58.02 I mean, like, when I'm there on it, very resourceful.
02:38:58.02 --> 02:39:01.02 I'm a resourceful person on his very good resource.
02:39:01.02 --> 02:39:03.02 The website.
02:39:03.02 --> 02:39:06.02 And the answer is yes, it does.
02:39:06.02 --> 02:39:10.02 It helps like even like the onset of like osteoporosis, like all this stuff.
02:39:10.02 --> 02:39:12.02 It's like that's that's what it's like.
02:39:12.02 --> 02:39:16.02 I didn't memorize all the terms, but I know the point, but it's,
02:39:16.02 --> 02:39:19.02 oh, yeah, strong team.
02:39:19.02 --> 02:39:21.02 I like the name it after.
02:39:21.02 --> 02:39:23.02 Yes, because strong team calcium, all these things like make it.
02:39:23.02 --> 02:39:26.02 So when you get older and you know, degeneration, you lose that.
02:39:26.02 --> 02:39:30.02 Yeah, I'll in your natural deal, you know,
02:39:30.02 --> 02:39:32.02 maybe and you get the strong bone.
02:39:32.02 --> 02:39:36.02 Strong bone, strong to jump back in your bones easy money.
02:39:36.02 --> 02:39:37.02 So you take the crew away.
02:39:37.02 --> 02:39:39.02 Back in your bones or back in your joints.
02:39:39.02 --> 02:39:43.02 Well, your joints are made up of your bones, tendons, ligaments.
02:39:43.02 --> 02:39:45.02 Does it go into everything?
02:39:45.02 --> 02:39:47.02 It goes into your bones.
02:39:47.02 --> 02:39:48.02 Okay.
02:39:48.02 --> 02:39:50.02 So you figure the tendon connection to your bone.
02:39:50.02 --> 02:39:52.02 That's that's the part that's what you're trying to do up.
02:39:52.02 --> 02:39:53.02 Yeah, that can jam me up.
02:39:53.02 --> 02:39:55.02 That's what you heard right in your bicep.
02:39:55.02 --> 02:39:57.02 Yeah, that's what I heard.
02:39:57.02 --> 02:39:58.02 Yeah, I heard it one day.
02:39:58.02 --> 02:40:01.02 It ripped off my bone, my bicep ripped off my bone.
02:40:01.02 --> 02:40:04.02 Anyway, if I had some strong bone, that one happened.
02:40:04.02 --> 02:40:05.02 Maybe it would have gone up.
02:40:05.02 --> 02:40:08.02 But nonetheless, that is what strong bone helps.
02:40:08.02 --> 02:40:10.02 So guess what I did got some.
02:40:10.02 --> 02:40:13.02 No worries.
02:40:13.02 --> 02:40:16.02 But yeah, there's not just that.
02:40:16.02 --> 02:40:18.02 There's all kinds of cool stuff.
02:40:18.02 --> 02:40:20.02 Warrior bars, that's not how I got more of those.
02:40:20.02 --> 02:40:24.02 Shroom tech for performance and the program.
02:40:24.02 --> 02:40:28.02 Here's the thing, I think sometimes people will kind of mistake the
02:40:28.02 --> 02:40:31.02 Shroom tech when you know, because it helps your oxygen.
02:40:31.02 --> 02:40:36.02 They think that like, I'm going to when I breathe, it has something to do with your breathing.
02:40:36.02 --> 02:40:38.02 You know, it's not your breathing or your lungs.
02:40:38.02 --> 02:40:42.02 It's the amount of oxygen you take up when you breathe.
02:40:42.02 --> 02:40:44.02 So they can go to your muscle.
02:40:44.02 --> 02:40:45.02 That's what it helps.
02:40:45.02 --> 02:40:52.02 So if you go hard, like, super hard or grappling long way called wads.
02:40:52.02 --> 02:40:53.02 Right?
02:40:53.02 --> 02:40:54.02 Where's the day?
02:40:54.02 --> 02:40:55.02 Yeah, yeah.
02:40:55.02 --> 02:40:56.02 It helps.
02:40:56.02 --> 02:40:57.02 Keep to the other red.
02:40:57.02 --> 02:40:59.02 But yeah, go on there.
02:40:59.02 --> 02:41:03.02 For whatever you do, you know, they even work out stuff and whatnot.
02:41:03.02 --> 02:41:04.02 It's actually kind of a fun website.
02:41:04.02 --> 02:41:07.02 You're beyond there for a while looking at the cool stuff.
02:41:07.02 --> 02:41:08.02 That's my opinion.
02:41:08.02 --> 02:41:10.02 And my experience.
02:41:10.02 --> 02:41:13.02 You know, subscribe to the podcast.
02:41:13.02 --> 02:41:16.02 Actually, you know what we'll talk about Amazon first.
02:41:16.02 --> 02:41:17.02 So Amazon click through.
02:41:17.02 --> 02:41:20.02 This is a good way to support podcasts.
02:41:20.02 --> 02:41:21.02 What you do.
02:41:21.02 --> 02:41:24.02 If you don't know already.
02:41:24.02 --> 02:41:26.02 Before you do your Amazon shopping.
02:41:26.02 --> 02:41:28.02 Go to jocopotcast.com.
02:41:28.02 --> 02:41:35.02 Either on the tab on the top left and green or on the top menu.
02:41:35.02 --> 02:41:39.02 Or on the side kind of towards the bottom.
02:41:39.02 --> 02:41:40.02 This is a place to click on.
02:41:40.02 --> 02:41:42.02 Just support through either support.
02:41:42.02 --> 02:41:44.02 Jocopotcast or Amazon click through.
02:41:44.02 --> 02:41:46.02 Anyway, before you do your Amazon shopping, click through there.
02:41:46.02 --> 02:41:49.02 Then do your shopping.
02:41:49.02 --> 02:41:51.02 I actually did that the other day.
02:41:51.02 --> 02:41:54.02 And I don't know if you're watching this on YouTube.
02:41:54.02 --> 02:41:57.02 But if you are, this is what I bought.
02:41:57.02 --> 02:42:00.02 Google just took towing.
02:42:00.02 --> 02:42:05.02 And also, also, if you totally missed this book.
02:42:05.02 --> 02:42:07.02 I didn't, I don't know if I made it clear enough.
02:42:07.02 --> 02:42:11.02 The book that we read today is called Hellment for my pillow.
02:42:11.02 --> 02:42:13.02 By Robert Lecky.
02:42:13.02 --> 02:42:15.02 You can get that Amazon.
02:42:15.02 --> 02:42:16.02 You're going to put it echo.
02:42:16.02 --> 02:42:17.02 We'll have it on the website.
02:42:17.02 --> 02:42:18.02 And we'll click that.
02:42:18.02 --> 02:42:19.02 And you buy it.
02:42:19.02 --> 02:42:20.02 Boom.
02:42:20.02 --> 02:42:21.02 You'll be good to go.
02:42:21.02 --> 02:42:22.02 Yeah.
02:42:22.02 --> 02:42:23.02 You will support the podcast.
02:42:23.02 --> 02:42:24.02 And it's a family.
02:42:24.02 --> 02:42:28.02 And some way, because there'll be somehow being supported.
02:42:28.02 --> 02:42:29.02 Right?
02:42:29.02 --> 02:42:30.02 Because they're owned.
02:42:30.02 --> 02:42:31.02 I'm sure of this book.
02:42:31.02 --> 02:42:35.02 So it's a good way to support this hero, this hero's family.
02:42:35.02 --> 02:42:38.02 And also get the Pacific.
02:42:38.02 --> 02:42:40.02 I don't know if we could put that.
02:42:40.02 --> 02:42:41.02 I don't know.
02:42:41.02 --> 02:42:42.02 But anyways, what?
02:42:42.02 --> 02:42:44.02 Like if you could put it on.
02:42:44.02 --> 02:42:45.02 Click through.
02:42:45.02 --> 02:42:47.02 Unless maybe someone bought the DVDs.
02:42:47.02 --> 02:42:49.02 But watch that.
02:42:49.02 --> 02:42:50.02 And you know what?
02:42:50.02 --> 02:42:51.02 When you watch it.
02:42:51.02 --> 02:42:53.02 And you wrap yourself mentally.
02:42:53.02 --> 02:42:54.02 And don't watch it.
02:42:54.02 --> 02:42:55.02 While there's other things going on.
02:42:55.02 --> 02:42:56.02 Sit down.
02:42:56.02 --> 02:42:57.02 Right.
02:42:57.02 --> 02:43:02.02 On a nice situation, you know, logistically with a good TV set.
02:43:02.02 --> 02:43:04.02 And a good speaker system.
02:43:04.02 --> 02:43:05.02 Throne.
02:43:05.02 --> 02:43:06.02 Yeah.
02:43:06.02 --> 02:43:07.02 And then watch the Pacific.
02:43:07.02 --> 02:43:08.02 And you only.
02:43:08.02 --> 02:43:11.02 Well, they're like, maybe you can watch two at a time.
02:43:11.02 --> 02:43:12.02 Maybe.
02:43:12.02 --> 02:43:13.02 What?
02:43:13.02 --> 02:43:14.02 Two episodes.
02:43:14.02 --> 02:43:15.02 But watch them close together too.
02:43:15.02 --> 02:43:17.02 So you kind of maintain the continuity of the situation.
02:43:17.02 --> 02:43:18.02 Right.
02:43:18.02 --> 02:43:19.02 Because that's good too.
02:43:19.02 --> 02:43:20.02 You see it.
02:43:20.02 --> 02:43:22.02 Man, it's just incredibly well done.
02:43:22.02 --> 02:43:23.02 The thing.
02:43:23.02 --> 02:43:24.02 Yeah.
02:43:24.02 --> 02:43:25.02 It's awesome.
02:43:25.02 --> 02:43:28.02 And then when you have the background of the podcast of the books.
02:43:28.02 --> 02:43:29.02 And you read the books, man.
02:43:29.02 --> 02:43:30.02 It's really.
02:43:30.02 --> 02:43:31.02 Yeah.
02:43:31.02 --> 02:43:32.02 Totally powerful.
02:43:32.02 --> 02:43:33.02 Like, come to me.
02:43:33.02 --> 02:43:34.02 You actually get more into it.
02:43:34.02 --> 02:43:35.02 Oh, for sure.
02:43:35.02 --> 02:43:36.02 You know, like, when you know the guys on the story.
02:43:36.02 --> 02:43:37.02 Yeah.
02:43:37.02 --> 02:43:38.02 For sure.
02:43:38.02 --> 02:43:39.02 You're more invested in the characters.
02:43:39.02 --> 02:43:40.02 Yeah.
02:43:40.02 --> 02:43:44.02 And you realize that when you see lucky lucky in the thing, you have his whole
02:43:44.02 --> 02:43:45.02 backstory.
02:43:45.02 --> 02:43:47.02 It was whole life when you've read the book.
02:43:47.02 --> 02:43:48.02 And it's awesome.
02:43:48.02 --> 02:43:53.02 You know, um, there's a, by the way, that is on the podcast website.
02:43:53.02 --> 02:43:58.02 There's a whole section, whole page with all the books of all the podcast.
02:43:58.02 --> 02:44:01.02 Make it easy for the book situation.
02:44:01.02 --> 02:44:02.02 But yeah.
02:44:02.02 --> 02:44:06.02 So yeah, before you do your Amazon shopping, click through this, the click through the Amazon
02:44:06.02 --> 02:44:07.02 link.
02:44:07.02 --> 02:44:08.02 And then do your shopping.
02:44:08.02 --> 02:44:11.02 And yes, I did buy this item, which I'm showing.
02:44:11.02 --> 02:44:14.02 So if you look on YouTube, you can see it.
02:44:14.02 --> 02:44:16.02 It's to add to our little collection on the table.
02:44:16.02 --> 02:44:19.02 Yeah.
02:44:19.02 --> 02:44:22.02 So yeah, speaking of YouTube, we have a YouTube channel.
02:44:22.02 --> 02:44:24.02 It's good.
02:44:24.02 --> 02:44:29.02 People have been telling me.
02:44:29.02 --> 02:44:33.02 For real, people have been telling me, not just one person, but they say, hey, you should take
02:44:33.02 --> 02:44:37.02 because, okay, on YouTube channel, we have the podcast, of course, the video format.
02:44:37.02 --> 02:44:40.02 Exerps, just like, you know, excerpts from the podcast.
02:44:40.02 --> 02:44:43.02 So you can, like, share them and stuff like that.
02:44:43.02 --> 02:44:47.02 And then there's like, well, what do you call them? What artistic pieces?
02:44:47.02 --> 02:44:51.02 Stuff that I put some like time into, put some track of soundtrack.
02:44:51.02 --> 02:44:53.02 Echo Charles videos.
02:44:53.02 --> 02:44:54.02 Sure. I just called it.
02:44:54.02 --> 02:44:56.02 I forget what I called it.
02:44:56.02 --> 02:44:58.02 Like discipline, something.
02:44:58.02 --> 02:44:59.02 I don't know.
02:44:59.02 --> 02:45:02.02 So you made three categories or two to play.
02:45:02.02 --> 02:45:07.02 So basically, people have been asked me, hey, you should separate them and make them into playlists.
02:45:07.02 --> 02:45:11.02 Which kind of new about, but I'm not deep into the YouTube thing.
02:45:11.02 --> 02:45:13.02 Well, we know that.
02:45:13.02 --> 02:45:17.02 Well, no, as far as the customization and all that, which, which I kind of looked into.
02:45:17.02 --> 02:45:18.02 So this is good.
02:45:18.02 --> 02:45:18.02 What?
02:45:18.02 --> 02:45:21.02 I like about this is people gave you a suggestion, which I saw too.
02:45:21.02 --> 02:45:25.02 You, you looked at it, you explored it, and now you executed on it.
02:45:25.02 --> 02:45:26.02 Yeah, totally did.
02:45:26.02 --> 02:45:30.02 So if there's any other good ideas that people have, they should post them.
02:45:30.02 --> 02:45:34.02 And so that way you can improve even more and we can improve and serve for them better.
02:45:34.02 --> 02:45:39.02 Yeah, I think so. I think that's, and of course, someone going to be like, hey,
02:45:39.02 --> 02:45:45.02 you know, and they'll say an idea, it might not be all that good, but if, or it may not seem like it's all that good.
02:45:45.02 --> 02:45:50.02 But if another person says it, kind of unrelated, you know, not the kind of where some guys should say,
02:45:50.02 --> 02:45:56.02 but do this, you know, make this or create this and then someone just likes it or puts a like on it.
02:45:56.02 --> 02:45:57.02 Or says, yeah.
02:45:57.02 --> 02:45:59.02 So you're asking for multiple.
02:45:59.02 --> 02:46:03.02 Well, not the split hairs, but I'm not asking for anything.
02:46:03.02 --> 02:46:05.02 Oh, I'm saying that's where the actor.
02:46:05.02 --> 02:46:10.02 Yeah, so if someone says a suggestion, maybe the next day, two days, three days later,
02:46:10.02 --> 02:46:13.02 another person says same suggestion, suggestion unrelated.
02:46:13.02 --> 02:46:17.02 And that, ten, the end of the tendency, I see a tendency coming up.
02:46:17.02 --> 02:46:19.02 Then that's when I'd start taking action.
02:46:19.02 --> 02:46:23.02 What about the 14,000 people that told you to make more videos?
02:46:23.02 --> 02:46:25.02 I think in more videos, yes, that's what I thought.
02:46:25.02 --> 02:46:28.02 Yeah, those are, no, because I was watching, I realized I was watching so many,
02:46:28.02 --> 02:46:35.02 I can't remember who was, but I was watching chunks of someone speak the other night, someone that I was, I don't know who was.
02:46:35.02 --> 02:46:38.02 And I was so happy that they were in short clips.
02:46:38.02 --> 02:46:40.02 I was like, this is why we need more short clips.
02:46:40.02 --> 02:46:41.02 Yeah.
02:46:41.02 --> 02:46:43.02 Because it's really convenient to go.
02:46:43.02 --> 02:46:44.02 What's this idea here?
02:46:44.02 --> 02:46:45.02 Boom.
02:46:45.02 --> 02:46:46.02 Yeah.
02:46:46.02 --> 02:46:46.02 You see the name of the video you go.
02:46:46.02 --> 02:46:47.02 Here's the idea.
02:46:47.02 --> 02:46:48.02 I want to think about that idea, boom.
02:46:48.02 --> 02:46:49.02 Yeah.
02:46:49.02 --> 02:46:49.02 You can go.
02:46:49.02 --> 02:46:54.02 And YouTube is good like that where if there's a bunch of them, which, well, I think we're kind of coming up with,
02:46:54.02 --> 02:46:55.02 or collections kind of growing now.
02:46:55.02 --> 02:46:57.02 There's a bud, I'd say there's a bunch of them.
02:46:57.02 --> 02:47:04.02 How well did you execute when people said make when people like episode 42 make a video from this to this?
02:47:04.02 --> 02:47:05.02 How, how did you do any of that?
02:47:05.02 --> 02:47:06.02 Or did you blow everyone off?
02:47:06.02 --> 02:47:07.02 No, no, no.
02:47:07.02 --> 02:47:09.02 Yeah, that's mainly what I've based it on.
02:47:09.02 --> 02:47:10.02 Oh, okay.
02:47:10.02 --> 02:47:14.02 So, but those are, they're everywhere, you know.
02:47:14.02 --> 02:47:17.02 So some of them don't quite translate.
02:47:17.02 --> 02:47:21.02 Some of them, I just, I mean, I don't want to upload like five in one day.
02:47:21.02 --> 02:47:26.02 And I've read some stuff that it's like, no, no, it's not good to do that, but, no, no, that's all, that's all, that's all long story.
02:47:26.02 --> 02:47:28.02 I bet I don't know.
02:47:28.02 --> 02:47:31.02 Let's not just, let's not think about what's good to do and what's not good to do.
02:47:31.02 --> 02:47:33.02 You just gotta get to see what you're trying to get.
02:47:33.02 --> 02:47:36.02 So yeah, you're trying to, yeah, I dig it, man.
02:47:36.02 --> 02:47:40.02 But yeah, YouTube's good like that where if you listen to just the, like, an excerpt,
02:47:40.02 --> 02:47:42.02 we're just a clip two minute three minutes four minutes.
02:47:42.02 --> 02:47:45.02 And you're like, dang, I want to, I want to listen to some more.
02:47:45.02 --> 02:47:51.02 They, not only are they there to listen if you want, but they'll suggest, so you'll have a bit of continuity there.
02:47:51.02 --> 02:47:54.02 Instead of like, oh, I'm locked into this three hour thing right now.
02:47:54.02 --> 02:48:01.02 Right. Well, that's, and that's one thing that's a little bit tricky about this is that when I, when I'm thinking, when I'm talking,
02:48:01.02 --> 02:48:04.02 I'm thinking in the context of this giant two hour thing.
02:48:04.02 --> 02:48:09.02 So sometimes it's hard to snip out something and you lose a little bit in my opinion.
02:48:09.02 --> 02:48:13.02 Yeah, but you also gain a lot because you can get it quick.
02:48:13.02 --> 02:48:20.02 Right. And you can share it with the next guy who's more likely or the next person to more likely, listen to it.
02:48:20.02 --> 02:48:27.02 Yeah. Because even now, man, people will send me, you know, whether it be funny videos, there's this sodium video that,
02:48:27.02 --> 02:48:31.02 you know, the guy skipping a piece of sodium across the lake.
02:48:31.02 --> 02:48:37.02 Yeah. You saw that, it's been going around. I don't know if people look for it and then send it to me or it's been going around.
02:48:37.02 --> 02:48:43.02 So now more people are sending it to me because the last like two weeks, everyone's been sending it to me.
02:48:43.02 --> 02:48:46.02 And I want to actually do that. I want to get the sodium metal.
02:48:46.02 --> 02:48:48.02 And I want to throw it into the water.
02:48:48.02 --> 02:48:56.02 Yeah, we're doing it at some point. Yeah. You're house. I do. If we can find it, I want to do it in film and then just see what I see what up.
02:48:56.02 --> 02:49:00.02 I got to start looking to get some sodium metal.
02:49:00.02 --> 02:49:10.02 But yeah, that's, you know, the, these are good things. These, these YouTube situation made the playlist there on there.
02:49:10.02 --> 02:49:13.02 Exerps, I'm putting more on there.
02:49:13.02 --> 02:49:15.02 There it is.
02:49:15.02 --> 02:49:22.02 Subscribe on iTunes or Stitcher or Google Play and all the podcast platforms.
02:49:22.02 --> 02:49:28.02 You know, that's a good way to support because you're essentially just kind of in the game in general.
02:49:28.02 --> 02:49:31.02 You know, and that's really the thing.
02:49:31.02 --> 02:49:40.02 Because like the more people, you know, they'll hit us on the pun Twitter or just like kind of knowing and knowing what year's talking about or submitting questions.
02:49:40.02 --> 02:49:45.02 This kind of stuff. It does make that circle of like, it's not just juggle telling us what to do.
02:49:45.02 --> 02:49:48.02 It's kind of like we're all in this group, you know.
02:49:48.02 --> 02:49:54.02 Well, yeah, it's like hanging out with your friends basically.
02:49:54.02 --> 02:50:02.02 Like when I go on the road now, like I was just out with some firefighters and like we're all, everyone's telling the same jokes.
02:50:02.02 --> 02:50:05.02 But they're all, you know, we all get it.
02:50:05.02 --> 02:50:06.02 Yeah, exactly.
02:50:06.02 --> 02:50:11.02 So it's cool right now with them because it's like as if they were here. And I was actually talking to them about them.
02:50:11.02 --> 02:50:15.02 Like, well, you know, when it first happened, it would be a little bit strange to me.
02:50:15.02 --> 02:50:16.02 Right.
02:50:16.02 --> 02:50:19.02 Because you don't remember them sitting there because no one was sitting there actually.
02:50:19.02 --> 02:50:24.02 And I was like, well, sometimes it seemed like the podcast was like, was me and echo sitting in a room alone.
02:50:24.02 --> 02:50:25.02 Right.
02:50:25.02 --> 02:50:27.02 But then you realize, no, there's a lot of people sitting in here with us.
02:50:27.02 --> 02:50:30.02 And they have their own spins.
02:50:30.02 --> 02:50:35.02 This is what's funny is people have their own variations on the jokes and on the inside things.
02:50:35.02 --> 02:50:40.02 And I'm like, well, we're talking about so it's all, and you know, they've already taken stuff and spun it out somewhere.
02:50:40.02 --> 02:50:43.02 And now they're bringing it back to me. So I'm part of there.
02:50:43.02 --> 02:50:44.02 Right.
02:50:44.02 --> 02:50:47.02 I get in and get inside their game. So it's pretty funny.
02:50:47.02 --> 02:50:47.02 Yeah.
02:50:47.02 --> 02:50:50.02 And that's not to mention the questions that you answer.
02:50:50.02 --> 02:50:52.02 It's all everyone's questions for sure.
02:50:52.02 --> 02:50:52.02 Yeah, for sure.
02:50:52.02 --> 02:50:56.02 That's not like you're like, let me think of this question that I think people have.
02:50:56.02 --> 02:51:00.02 No, you got it from certain people and you know, answer them there.
02:51:00.02 --> 02:51:01.02 Yeah.
02:51:01.02 --> 02:51:04.02 You know, it's like a two, three way street.
02:51:04.02 --> 02:51:06.02 You do something better.
02:51:06.02 --> 02:51:11.02 Anyway, so yeah, when you're, when you're subscribed, you're, you know, you're kind of in the group.
02:51:11.02 --> 02:51:13.02 Good way to support.
02:51:13.02 --> 02:51:16.02 Also, jacquoise store called jacquoise store.
02:51:16.02 --> 02:51:17.02 Good store.
02:51:17.02 --> 02:51:21.02 Isn't more like the podcast has a store because I don't actually have a store.
02:51:21.02 --> 02:51:24.02 It's the podcast has a store.
02:51:24.02 --> 02:51:26.02 Yeah, yes, technically.
02:51:26.02 --> 02:51:28.02 But you always make it sound like I have a store.
02:51:28.02 --> 02:51:30.02 Yeah, because it's called jacquoise store.
02:51:30.02 --> 02:51:31.02 We have a store.
02:51:31.02 --> 02:51:32.02 Yeah.
02:51:32.02 --> 02:51:35.02 It's not jacquoise store.
02:51:35.02 --> 02:51:36.02 It's jacquoise store.
02:51:36.02 --> 02:51:37.02 Okay.
02:51:37.02 --> 02:51:38.02 Seems same.
02:51:38.02 --> 02:51:40.02 I'm going to concede to the point.
02:51:40.02 --> 02:51:41.02 There it is.
02:51:41.02 --> 02:51:42.02 Boom.
02:51:42.02 --> 02:51:43.02 I have a store.
02:51:43.02 --> 02:51:44.02 That's what I don't like about it.
02:51:44.02 --> 02:51:45.02 I don't know.
02:51:45.02 --> 02:51:48.02 But when I say it, I think it sounds cool.
02:51:48.02 --> 02:51:49.02 Sure.
02:51:49.02 --> 02:51:50.02 It's on there.
02:51:50.02 --> 02:51:53.02 If you want to wear T shirts and represent.
02:51:53.02 --> 02:51:55.02 Got a new design out there.
02:51:55.02 --> 02:51:58.02 Well, kind of new two weeks, three weeks, maybe.
02:51:58.02 --> 02:51:59.02 Yeah.
02:51:59.02 --> 02:52:01.02 And actually it's a new T shirt design.
02:52:01.02 --> 02:52:04.02 It could be found in other places.
02:52:04.02 --> 02:52:05.02 Oh, yeah.
02:52:05.02 --> 02:52:06.02 Right.
02:52:06.02 --> 02:52:07.02 Sure.
02:52:07.02 --> 02:52:08.02 What do you mean?
02:52:08.02 --> 02:52:09.02 I mean.
02:52:09.02 --> 02:52:10.02 All right.
02:52:10.02 --> 02:52:11.02 Great.
02:52:11.02 --> 02:52:12.02 We found in other places.
02:52:12.02 --> 02:52:13.02 Yeah, man.
02:52:13.02 --> 02:52:14.02 It's good.
02:52:14.02 --> 02:52:15.02 But hey, look.
02:52:15.02 --> 02:52:16.02 Like on the get after it.
02:52:16.02 --> 02:52:17.02 That's where it could be found straight up.
02:52:17.02 --> 02:52:18.02 I don't want to try.
02:52:18.02 --> 02:52:19.02 It's a little game here.
02:52:19.02 --> 02:52:20.02 Like I wasn't going to say anything.
02:52:20.02 --> 02:52:21.02 It's the get after it.
02:52:21.02 --> 02:52:23.02 We got to shirt this as get after it.
02:52:23.02 --> 02:52:25.02 And now one came highly recommended.
02:52:25.02 --> 02:52:26.02 Perfect.
02:52:26.02 --> 02:52:28.02 Perfect example of people saying, you know,
02:52:28.02 --> 02:52:31.02 people were saying it so like like mad.
02:52:31.02 --> 02:52:35.02 It's the fact is yeah, where it was to the point where they were like,
02:52:35.02 --> 02:52:37.02 Hey, you should you should do it.
02:52:37.02 --> 02:52:38.02 Get after it.
02:52:38.02 --> 02:52:38.02 Sure.
02:52:38.02 --> 02:52:39.02 They weren't saying that anymore.
02:52:39.02 --> 02:52:41.02 They were saying when the get after it.
02:52:41.02 --> 02:52:41.02 Sure.
02:52:41.02 --> 02:52:42.02 Come out when do they come out?
02:52:42.02 --> 02:52:44.02 I didn't know we were doing that yet.
02:52:44.02 --> 02:52:46.02 But apparently we are so boom.
02:52:46.02 --> 02:52:47.02 They're out.
02:52:47.02 --> 02:52:48.02 They got you.
02:52:48.02 --> 02:52:49.02 They got you with psychological work.
02:52:49.02 --> 02:52:50.02 Man, I'm glad they did.
02:52:50.02 --> 02:52:52.02 Because I think they turned out good.
02:52:52.02 --> 02:52:53.02 I'm real simple.
02:52:53.02 --> 02:52:54.02 Like most things.
02:52:54.02 --> 02:52:55.02 You know, these shirts are cool.
02:52:55.02 --> 02:52:56.02 I think.
02:52:56.02 --> 02:52:59.02 But go to jockelstore.com and look at them.
02:52:59.02 --> 02:53:00.02 You think they're cool.
02:53:00.02 --> 02:53:03.02 You think you want to wear one represent in the wild.
02:53:03.02 --> 02:53:04.02 Go ahead.
02:53:04.02 --> 02:53:06.02 Get one support one now.
02:53:06.02 --> 02:53:10.02 I also some, you know, some women stuff out there.
02:53:10.02 --> 02:53:13.02 Women might be underrepresented overall.
02:53:13.02 --> 02:53:19.02 But I think that the women that are kind of in the game that listen.
02:53:19.02 --> 02:53:20.02 They get after it.
02:53:20.02 --> 02:53:23.02 They get after it hard to make up for the numbers.
02:53:23.02 --> 02:53:25.02 You know, you seem saying like the quality.
02:53:25.02 --> 02:53:27.02 It's greater than the quantity.
02:53:27.02 --> 02:53:29.02 Anyway, I got some patches on there too.
02:53:29.02 --> 02:53:30.02 The rash guards, of course.
02:53:30.02 --> 02:53:31.02 I'm going to put a new one out.
02:53:31.02 --> 02:53:32.02 It's in the works.
02:53:32.02 --> 02:53:36.02 It's like ready to be pushed out in a few days.
02:53:36.02 --> 02:53:38.02 I think maybe a week.
02:53:38.02 --> 02:53:44.02 So yeah, if you're into jiu-jitsu, that's why I think that's the primary reason I made them.
02:53:44.02 --> 02:53:47.02 But they're actually for surfing.
02:53:47.02 --> 02:53:49.02 Body boarding.
02:53:49.02 --> 02:53:50.02 What jockels?
02:53:50.02 --> 02:53:51.02 Spunging.
02:53:51.02 --> 02:53:52.02 Spud.
02:53:52.02 --> 02:53:53.02 Cycling.
02:53:53.02 --> 02:53:54.02 Crossfit.
02:53:54.02 --> 02:54:00.02 Any kind of workout where you need, you know, like maximum mobility, but you still want to go with like a shirt on.
02:54:00.02 --> 02:54:03.02 Sometimes you just go no shirt.
02:54:03.02 --> 02:54:04.02 But yeah.
02:54:04.02 --> 02:54:07.02 If you go no shirt, you're not supported in the podcast.
02:54:07.02 --> 02:54:08.02 Correct.
02:54:08.02 --> 02:54:09.02 Correct.
02:54:09.02 --> 02:54:14.02 And, you know, that the, I think, you know, we kind of did some calculations.
02:54:14.02 --> 02:54:17.02 I think the new rash guard might, I'm not saying it will because we don't know yet.
02:54:17.02 --> 02:54:18.02 They're not here.
02:54:18.02 --> 02:54:19.02 They might yield.
02:54:19.02 --> 02:54:21.02 Was it 24?
02:54:21.02 --> 02:54:23.02 Oh, so echo did.
02:54:23.02 --> 02:54:25.02 He's got the sample one.
02:54:25.02 --> 02:54:26.02 You'll want some.
02:54:26.02 --> 02:54:30.02 And the sample one, you said, give you like 27%
02:54:30.02 --> 02:54:32.02 I thought I'm a bandage.
02:54:32.02 --> 02:54:33.02 24.
02:54:33.02 --> 02:54:35.02 But you know what, now that you mentioned it, I think it was 27.
02:54:35.02 --> 02:54:36.02 Yeah.
02:54:36.02 --> 02:54:37.02 Yes.
02:54:37.02 --> 02:54:38.02 Up from 19.
02:54:38.02 --> 02:54:39.02 Yeah, which is a lot.
02:54:39.02 --> 02:54:41.02 But that's only one case study.
02:54:41.02 --> 02:54:42.02 So that's what I'm saying.
02:54:42.02 --> 02:54:44.02 We're really good at, um, double blind.
02:54:44.02 --> 02:54:45.02 Ten.
02:54:45.02 --> 02:54:47.02 This is actually true where I went and I practiced.
02:54:47.02 --> 02:54:48.02 I did some rounds.
02:54:48.02 --> 02:54:51.02 And you look like when you're done rounds and you're kind of talking with the boys afterwards.
02:54:51.02 --> 02:54:52.02 Yeah.
02:54:52.02 --> 02:54:54.02 And girls in our case because Kaylee was there too.
02:54:54.02 --> 02:54:55.02 We're talking.
02:54:55.02 --> 02:54:56.02 And I thought we were done.
02:54:56.02 --> 02:54:57.02 We were done.
02:54:57.02 --> 02:54:58.02 Somebody called.
02:54:58.02 --> 02:54:59.02 You're like, hey guys, co.
02:54:59.02 --> 02:55:01.02 And then David,
02:55:01.02 --> 02:55:03.02 Sesame's bulia.
02:55:03.02 --> 02:55:05.02 He's like, oh, hold the holdings.
02:55:05.02 --> 02:55:06.02 Yeah.
02:55:06.02 --> 02:55:09.02 nephew, like, actually actual nephew, like,
02:55:09.02 --> 02:55:11.02 his dad's brother or something.
02:55:11.02 --> 02:55:12.02 I might get that part wrong.
02:55:12.02 --> 02:55:13.02 But it's yeah, anyway.
02:55:13.02 --> 02:55:14.02 That's a side note.
02:55:14.02 --> 02:55:15.02 He called you out.
02:55:15.02 --> 02:55:16.02 Yeah.
02:55:16.02 --> 02:55:17.02 Well, he asks.
02:55:17.02 --> 02:55:18.02 He wants to roll in and go.
02:55:18.02 --> 02:55:22.02 He goes, what?
02:55:22.02 --> 02:55:23.02 It's to the rounds left.
02:55:23.02 --> 02:55:24.02 Shrimp tech.
02:55:24.02 --> 02:55:25.02 Rashguard.
02:55:25.02 --> 02:55:26.02 That's it.
02:55:26.02 --> 02:55:26.02 Yeah.
02:55:26.02 --> 02:55:27.02 We've got it wrong with the lead.
02:55:27.02 --> 02:55:28.02 Anyway, yeah.
02:55:28.02 --> 02:55:28.02 Good.
02:55:28.02 --> 02:55:29.02 Good deal.
02:55:29.02 --> 02:55:30.02 Good experience.
02:55:30.02 --> 02:55:32.02 But that's got a good deep half guard.
02:55:32.02 --> 02:55:33.02 Yeah.
02:55:33.02 --> 02:55:34.02 He has good.
02:55:34.02 --> 02:55:34.02 Yeah.
02:55:34.02 --> 02:55:34.02 Yeah.
02:55:34.02 --> 02:55:35.02 But he's deep half guard.
02:55:35.02 --> 02:55:37.02 He's got because he's, he's a bigger dude.
02:55:37.02 --> 02:55:39.02 But he got the depth of the guard.
02:55:39.02 --> 02:55:39.02 Yeah.
02:55:39.02 --> 02:55:40.02 He's bigger than Jeff.
02:55:40.02 --> 02:55:41.02 He's got a good.
02:55:41.02 --> 02:55:42.02 He's trimmed up a little bit.
02:55:42.02 --> 02:55:44.02 But nonetheless, yeah, good.
02:55:44.02 --> 02:55:45.02 Good training.
02:55:45.02 --> 02:55:46.02 Also.
02:55:46.02 --> 02:55:47.02 Psychological work.
02:55:47.02 --> 02:55:48.02 Psychological warfare.
02:55:48.02 --> 02:55:54.02 So if you know what that is, it's an album with tracks, juggle talking.
02:55:54.02 --> 02:55:56.02 But he's not just talking.
02:55:56.02 --> 02:56:01.02 He's talking with the intent of getting you through any moments of weakness that you might
02:56:01.02 --> 02:56:05.02 have in your getting after it journey.
02:56:05.02 --> 02:56:07.02 Isn't it goes beyond might have?
02:56:07.02 --> 02:56:08.02 Right.
02:56:08.02 --> 02:56:09.02 It goes into actual moments of weakness.
02:56:09.02 --> 02:56:11.02 Not that you are in a moment of weakness.
02:56:11.02 --> 02:56:13.02 You're looking at actual donuts.
02:56:13.02 --> 02:56:14.02 They're in front of you.
02:56:14.02 --> 02:56:15.02 Right.
02:56:15.02 --> 02:56:16.02 They're breaking you down mentally.
02:56:16.02 --> 02:56:17.02 Right.
02:56:17.02 --> 02:56:18.02 Don't click that.
02:56:18.02 --> 02:56:19.02 No.
02:56:19.02 --> 02:56:20.02 Hit play.
02:56:20.02 --> 02:56:21.02 Hit play.
02:56:21.02 --> 02:56:22.02 Get the track in there.
02:56:22.02 --> 02:56:23.02 The actual monotopotential moment of weakness.
02:56:23.02 --> 02:56:24.02 They're the moment of weakness is upon us.
02:56:24.02 --> 02:56:26.02 We're going to feed it.
02:56:26.02 --> 02:56:27.02 Yeah.
02:56:27.02 --> 02:56:28.02 Psychological warfare.
02:56:28.02 --> 02:56:29.02 Yeah.
02:56:29.02 --> 02:56:31.02 And we're getting requests now for the second one.
02:56:31.02 --> 02:56:32.02 Yeah.
02:56:32.02 --> 02:56:34.02 So I'm going to start thinking about that.
02:56:34.02 --> 02:56:35.02 What that's going to be like.
02:56:35.02 --> 02:56:36.02 Yeah.
02:56:36.02 --> 02:56:39.02 And if you want recommendations of what particular moments of weakness that you might have that
02:56:39.02 --> 02:56:40.02 need to be overcome.
02:56:40.02 --> 02:56:43.02 And there's a common theme as echo referred to.
02:56:43.02 --> 02:56:47.02 And if it's got to be something that I've dealt with before.
02:56:47.02 --> 02:56:48.02 Right.
02:56:48.02 --> 02:56:54.02 Because I can't just make up some way of overcoming a weakness that I've never experienced.
02:56:54.02 --> 02:56:56.02 Now I've experienced a lot of weaknesses.
02:56:56.02 --> 02:57:00.02 But if you come up with something that I've never experienced, then we're going to have to just
02:57:00.02 --> 02:57:01.02 forgo that one.
02:57:01.02 --> 02:57:03.02 Because I'm not going to make it up for go.
02:57:03.02 --> 02:57:05.02 I'm not going to make up with the brand might not work.
02:57:05.02 --> 02:57:06.02 Right.
02:57:06.02 --> 02:57:07.02 It's hard to manufacture.
02:57:07.02 --> 02:57:08.02 You can manufacture in Sparado.
02:57:08.02 --> 02:57:10.02 That's the great.
02:57:10.02 --> 02:57:13.02 Yeah.
02:57:13.02 --> 02:57:14.02 Yeah.
02:57:14.02 --> 02:57:15.02 I got some.
02:57:15.02 --> 02:57:16.02 Oh, talk about that.
02:57:16.02 --> 02:57:17.02 It's from a quiet dude.
02:57:17.02 --> 02:57:19.02 That's where it's going to come from.
02:57:19.02 --> 02:57:20.02 Sure.
02:57:20.02 --> 02:57:21.02 A still one.
02:57:21.02 --> 02:57:22.02 That's a quiet dude.
02:57:22.02 --> 02:57:25.02 That's a good on psychological warfare.
02:57:25.02 --> 02:57:26.02 Joccal wheeling.
02:57:26.02 --> 02:57:28.02 iTunes, Amazon music.
02:57:28.02 --> 02:57:29.02 All those good.
02:57:29.02 --> 02:57:30.02 It's probably any music outlet.
02:57:30.02 --> 02:57:32.02 A bunch of music outlets here.
02:57:32.02 --> 02:57:33.02 Yeah.
02:57:33.02 --> 02:57:34.02 Yeah.
02:57:34.02 --> 02:57:34.02 Just jump on that.
02:57:34.02 --> 02:57:35.02 It helps.
02:57:35.02 --> 02:57:36.02 And I use it.
02:57:36.02 --> 02:57:37.02 I don't recommend this.
02:57:37.02 --> 02:57:39.02 But I used it.
02:57:39.02 --> 02:57:40.02 I don't feel like working out.
02:57:40.02 --> 02:57:42.02 This is a big thing for me because I kind of had it like that.
02:57:42.02 --> 02:57:48.02 Well, I'll be like, oh, I'm just going to rest because I don't feel like I didn't get nine hours of sleep songs to it tomorrow.
02:57:48.02 --> 02:57:49.02 No.
02:57:49.02 --> 02:57:50.02 Yeah.
02:57:50.02 --> 02:57:52.02 Man, and it really worked with that.
02:57:52.02 --> 02:57:53.02 The workout one.
02:57:53.02 --> 02:57:56.02 A guy, you know, you said it works 100% of the time.
02:57:56.02 --> 02:57:57.02 Yes.
02:57:57.02 --> 02:57:58.02 Like the wake up one.
02:57:58.02 --> 02:57:59.02 Yeah.
02:57:59.02 --> 02:58:00.02 Because there's three wake up tracks.
02:58:00.02 --> 02:58:04.02 A guy on Twitter said a number of wake up track didn't work.
02:58:04.02 --> 02:58:05.02 It failed.
02:58:05.02 --> 02:58:06.02 Interesting.
02:58:06.02 --> 02:58:08.02 And then he said, but I made it to the number two.
02:58:08.02 --> 02:58:10.02 Wake up track, which is the way they're set.
02:58:10.02 --> 02:58:12.02 They're set like you listen to one.
02:58:12.02 --> 02:58:13.02 That's going to get you up.
02:58:13.02 --> 02:58:14.02 But if it doesn't number two is waiting.
02:58:14.02 --> 02:58:15.02 Right.
02:58:15.02 --> 02:58:16.02 And you got the number two and then he woke up.
02:58:16.02 --> 02:58:19.02 So we're still batting a thousand.
02:58:19.02 --> 02:58:20.02 Overall.
02:58:20.02 --> 02:58:21.02 Yeah.
02:58:21.02 --> 02:58:22.02 The overall campaign, right?
02:58:22.02 --> 02:58:22.02 Yeah.
02:58:22.02 --> 02:58:23.02 The campaign is a win.
02:58:23.02 --> 02:58:29.02 But we did take a bigger from one dude that just didn't get out of bed after listening to psychological warfare.
02:58:29.02 --> 02:58:31.02 Get out of bed track for one.
02:58:31.02 --> 02:58:32.02 He had to go to track to.
02:58:32.02 --> 02:58:33.02 But we're there.
02:58:33.02 --> 02:58:34.02 Yeah.
02:58:34.02 --> 02:58:35.02 He had some reserves.
02:58:35.02 --> 02:58:36.02 Got some backup.
02:58:36.02 --> 02:58:37.02 That's what we had for that.
02:58:37.02 --> 02:58:39.02 But I don't think anyone's made it to three yet.
02:58:39.02 --> 02:58:41.02 No one's made it to the wake up track for you.
02:58:41.02 --> 02:58:42.02 And then they're, yeah.
02:58:42.02 --> 02:58:44.02 That must to make it even to make it to two.
02:58:44.02 --> 02:58:45.02 You must be one tired dude.
02:58:45.02 --> 02:58:48.02 You must have had like a hard night.
02:58:48.02 --> 02:58:48.02 Night.
02:58:48.02 --> 02:58:49.02 And then before.
02:58:49.02 --> 02:58:52.02 And you must have hard workout waiting for your son on it on something.
02:58:52.02 --> 02:58:53.02 But yeah.
02:58:53.02 --> 02:58:55.02 I mean, my experience hundred percent success rate.
02:58:55.02 --> 02:58:56.02 But I don't.
02:58:56.02 --> 02:59:01.02 And then I started doing it just because just because I want to get fired up.
02:59:01.02 --> 02:59:02.02 Yeah.
02:59:02.02 --> 02:59:03.02 And it's weird because it's not.
02:59:03.02 --> 02:59:07.02 It's not that.
02:59:07.02 --> 02:59:08.02 It's almost like this.
02:59:08.02 --> 02:59:09.02 Yeah.
02:59:09.02 --> 02:59:11.02 Some people say to me, Hey, can you do one of you yelling?
02:59:11.02 --> 02:59:13.02 I'm like, Why don't we yell a lot, man?
02:59:13.02 --> 02:59:15.02 Like I didn't get on my yeller.
02:59:15.02 --> 02:59:16.02 Yeah.
02:59:16.02 --> 02:59:17.02 Now, let me see the me present.
02:59:17.02 --> 02:59:21.02 If we're in the gym and like I'm pushing someone like a MMA fighter.
02:59:21.02 --> 02:59:22.02 That's in a workout.
02:59:22.02 --> 02:59:23.02 I'm going to come on.
02:59:23.02 --> 02:59:24.02 You know, I might raise my voice a little bit.
02:59:24.02 --> 02:59:26.02 But I'm not going to yell at you.
02:59:26.02 --> 02:59:29.02 You know, the drone structure type thing.
02:59:29.02 --> 02:59:30.02 It's not this not.
02:59:30.02 --> 02:59:31.02 Yeah.
02:59:31.02 --> 02:59:34.02 What I do and I could see maybe like how that could be effective.
02:59:34.02 --> 02:59:37.02 But in these cases, that's not the mood you're in anywhere.
02:59:37.02 --> 02:59:38.02 You know what?
02:59:38.02 --> 02:59:40.02 It could be effective for certain instances.
02:59:40.02 --> 02:59:41.02 Yes.
02:59:41.02 --> 02:59:44.02 And actually, like I've been doing some little videos in the morning.
02:59:44.02 --> 02:59:48.02 Oh, and and and I realize when I watch them,
02:59:48.02 --> 02:59:51.02 that I'm getting a little bit aggressive with the way I'm talking.
02:59:51.02 --> 02:59:52.02 And it's not.
02:59:52.02 --> 02:59:53.02 It's not like I'm saying, Okay, I could.
02:59:53.02 --> 02:59:56.02 No, I'm just starting to talk and then I start getting naturally.
02:59:56.02 --> 03:00:00.02 I start escalating my own situation because I'm starting to think about when I'm
03:00:00.02 --> 03:00:03.02 saying it means something to me.
03:00:03.02 --> 03:00:04.02 Right.
03:00:04.02 --> 03:00:06.02 So when I'm saying hey, you know, you're wasting your life right now.
03:00:06.02 --> 03:00:10.02 I start thinking, I feel in that way because I know that there's someone that's actually
03:00:10.02 --> 03:00:11.02 wasting their life right now.
03:00:11.02 --> 03:00:15.02 And so it starts, you know, getting a little bit escalated.
03:00:15.02 --> 03:00:20.02 And so maybe on psychological warfare too, there'll be some situation that
03:00:20.02 --> 03:00:23.02 that I personally escalate on.
03:00:23.02 --> 03:00:24.02 Yeah.
03:00:24.02 --> 03:00:25.02 What does it be natural, right?
03:00:25.02 --> 03:00:26.02 Kind of thing.
03:00:26.02 --> 03:00:27.02 Yeah.
03:00:27.02 --> 03:00:28.02 Because you can have manufacturer in Sparato.
03:00:28.02 --> 03:00:29.02 Yeah.
03:00:29.02 --> 03:00:30.02 There he go.
03:00:30.02 --> 03:00:31.02 But yeah, it's good.
03:00:31.02 --> 03:00:35.02 It's like because you just kind of explain, like kind of the logic behind it.
03:00:35.02 --> 03:00:37.02 Like see what you're doing right now.
03:00:37.02 --> 03:00:38.02 But do you see that?
03:00:38.02 --> 03:00:38.02 Yeah.
03:00:38.02 --> 03:00:40.02 Well, I guess now I do shoot.
03:00:40.02 --> 03:00:41.02 Then you get up.
03:00:41.02 --> 03:00:44.02 You know, yeah, I use it when it's now.
03:00:44.02 --> 03:00:45.02 Sometimes I abuse it.
03:00:45.02 --> 03:00:46.02 Well, I don't know.
03:00:46.02 --> 03:00:47.02 I'm feeling fired up and just put it in.
03:00:47.02 --> 03:00:48.02 Get more fired up.
03:00:48.02 --> 03:00:51.02 Get talked into feeling even better.
03:00:51.02 --> 03:00:53.02 That's how dangerous things are.
03:00:53.02 --> 03:00:54.02 It's like a lot of work.
03:00:54.02 --> 03:00:55.02 It's good one.
03:00:55.02 --> 03:00:57.02 Also when you're clicking through Amazon, you can also get
03:00:57.02 --> 03:01:02.02 a good chocolate tea, which it may not seem like a big deal.
03:01:02.02 --> 03:01:05.02 And maybe it isn't, but maybe it is.
03:01:05.02 --> 03:01:13.02 I tell you, judging from some of the, some of the reviews on Amazon, I'm really doing.
03:01:13.02 --> 03:01:20.02 After drinking, jacquawait tea, I found I was overcome with the insurmountable urge to get after it.
03:01:20.02 --> 03:01:26.82 So much so that I was able to defeat all my foes in a short amount of time on a side
03:01:26.82 --> 03:01:32.82 note, I found that jacquawait tea is best served over ice and consumed from the skulls of dead enemies.
03:01:32.82 --> 03:01:37.82 Now, you know, I don't know what situation this individual is in, right?
03:01:37.82 --> 03:01:39.82 But obviously he's in combat situation.
03:01:39.82 --> 03:01:43.82 He's got foes that need to be killed and he's drinking from their skulls.
03:01:43.82 --> 03:01:48.82 And even in that really stressful environment, you know, the tea's helping him, which is cool.
03:01:48.82 --> 03:01:54.82 I'm glad that it's helping him doing positive things against the enemies of good in the world.
03:01:54.82 --> 03:02:01.82 Also, good evening, echo in jacquaw, I woke up weighing 115 pounds the day the white tea arrives.
03:02:01.82 --> 03:02:05.82 Two cups later I re-weight myself and I was now roughly 250 pounds.
03:02:05.82 --> 03:02:11.82 So he more than doubled his body weight after two cups of jacquawait tea.
03:02:11.82 --> 03:02:18.82 I think my tea was a little loaded and obviously gave me more than the 20% increase in gains that was promised.
03:02:18.82 --> 03:02:23.82 And I don't think we actually promised anything. I didn't promise that, but I think it kind of speaks for itself.
03:02:23.82 --> 03:02:28.82 And this is the important. This is why I wanted to make this one very important.
03:02:28.82 --> 03:02:34.82 Also, cruising went up roughly 200%. So there's that as well.
03:02:34.82 --> 03:02:36.82 So yeah, it's very bad for everybody.
03:02:36.82 --> 03:02:43.82 Well, you know, and there you go. Scientific cruising is up 200% which is positive.
03:02:43.82 --> 03:02:48.82 Also, way of the warrior kid, I got the first hard coffee.
03:02:48.82 --> 03:02:53.82 I got it in my hands. They sent me one. They're sending me more.
03:02:53.82 --> 03:02:57.82 But, you know, how dang it's three hours right now.
03:02:57.82 --> 03:02:59.82 We've been talking for three hours.
03:02:59.82 --> 03:03:01.82 That's my fault.
03:03:01.82 --> 03:03:03.82 Oh, man, that's a long time.
03:03:03.82 --> 03:03:06.82 And I was going to read a little excerpt.
03:03:06.82 --> 03:03:08.82 And I think I'm going to do this.
03:03:08.82 --> 03:03:09.82 It's already been three hours.
03:03:09.82 --> 03:03:17.82 But, but so, young Mark is, he's going to jump off this bridge.
03:03:17.82 --> 03:03:19.82 He couldn't swim in the beginning of the book.
03:03:19.82 --> 03:03:20.82 Now he knows how to swim.
03:03:20.82 --> 03:03:22.82 But his goal is to jump off the bridge into the river.
03:03:22.82 --> 03:03:24.82 And he goes up there to do it.
03:03:24.82 --> 03:03:28.82 And he's scared. He gets scared. He's not going to just, he just can't jump.
03:03:28.82 --> 03:03:32.82 So Uncle Jake, who used to be a seal?
03:03:32.82 --> 03:03:35.82 Who's now with his young nephew trying to show him the warrior way.
03:03:35.82 --> 03:03:37.82 Goes up on the bridge.
03:03:37.82 --> 03:03:38.82 And he said, what's going on, buddy?
03:03:38.82 --> 03:03:40.82 He said in a calm voice, I don't know.
03:03:40.82 --> 03:03:44.82 I said, I'm just, I'm just, you're afraid, aren't you?
03:03:44.82 --> 03:03:46.82 Uncle Jake asked.
03:03:46.82 --> 03:03:48.82 But he wasn't even asking.
03:03:48.82 --> 03:03:51.82 He knew. He knew I was scared.
03:03:51.82 --> 03:03:54.82 There was no point denying it.
03:03:54.82 --> 03:03:57.82 Uncle Jake knew it as plain as day.
03:03:57.82 --> 03:03:59.82 Yes.
03:03:59.82 --> 03:04:03.82 I finally said in a quiet tone, two embarrassed that I was afraid.
03:04:03.82 --> 03:04:07.82 Then, to my surprise, Uncle Jake said, that's normal.
03:04:07.82 --> 03:04:10.82 What? I responded?
03:04:10.82 --> 03:04:12.82 Shocked at Uncle Jake statement.
03:04:12.82 --> 03:04:14.82 I said, that's normal.
03:04:14.82 --> 03:04:18.82 You're doing something you've never done before, so it's normal to be a little hesitant.
03:04:18.82 --> 03:04:20.82 It's called fear.
03:04:20.82 --> 03:04:24.82 It's a normal emotion, and it's okay.
03:04:24.82 --> 03:04:29.82 Then he added, well, it's okay as long as you can control it.
03:04:29.82 --> 03:04:31.82 This made no sense to me.
03:04:31.82 --> 03:04:33.82 How am I supposed to control fear?
03:04:33.82 --> 03:04:37.82 And how would you know? You're not afraid of anything.
03:04:37.82 --> 03:04:40.82 Uncle Jake sat quietly for a minute.
03:04:40.82 --> 03:04:45.82 Then he said, I wish that were true.
03:04:45.82 --> 03:04:48.82 What do you mean? I asked him.
03:04:48.82 --> 03:04:51.82 Well, you said, I'm not afraid of anything.
03:04:51.82 --> 03:04:53.82 And that is just not true.
03:04:53.82 --> 03:04:54.82 Fear is normal.
03:04:54.82 --> 03:04:57.82 In fact, fear is good.
03:04:57.82 --> 03:05:00.82 Fear is what warns you and things are dangerous.
03:05:00.82 --> 03:05:02.82 Fear is what makes you prepare.
03:05:02.82 --> 03:05:05.82 Fear keeps us out of a lot of trouble.
03:05:05.82 --> 03:05:08.82 So there's nothing wrong with fear.
03:05:08.82 --> 03:05:11.82 But fear can also be overwhelming.
03:05:11.82 --> 03:05:13.82 It can be unreasonable.
03:05:13.82 --> 03:05:20.82 It can cause you to freeze up and make bad decisions or hesitate when you need to act.
03:05:20.82 --> 03:05:24.82 So you have to learn to control fear,
03:05:24.82 --> 03:05:28.82 and that's what you need to do right now.
03:05:28.82 --> 03:05:33.82 Okay, that sounds great, and I would really love to make you happy and overcome my fear,
03:05:33.82 --> 03:05:35.82 but I don't know how.
03:05:35.82 --> 03:05:38.82 Uncle Jake thought about that.
03:05:38.82 --> 03:05:44.82 About what I just said for a few seconds, and then he said, okay, well,
03:05:44.82 --> 03:05:47.82 the first part of controlling fear you've already done.
03:05:47.82 --> 03:05:49.82 And that is preparation.
03:05:49.82 --> 03:05:55.82 You've done plenty of preparation to be ready for this moment to face this fear.
03:05:55.82 --> 03:05:57.82 Starting with dunking your head,
03:05:57.82 --> 03:06:00.82 all the way up to swimming all around and back and forth across this river,
03:06:00.82 --> 03:06:04.82 you've done little jumps off the riverbank.
03:06:04.82 --> 03:06:09.82 All of the last several weeks have been preparing you for this, this jump.
03:06:09.82 --> 03:06:14.82 And all that preparation works to help overcome the fear.
03:06:14.82 --> 03:06:18.82 Imagine how scared you would be if you still didn't know how to swim.
03:06:18.82 --> 03:06:22.82 You would be horrified, but you have prepared.
03:06:22.82 --> 03:06:24.82 Then why am I still scared?
03:06:24.82 --> 03:06:27.82 I asked Uncle Jake simple, he said,
03:06:27.82 --> 03:06:30.82 because there's still an element of the unknown.
03:06:30.82 --> 03:06:35.82 You've never jumped off anything this high before, so you don't know what it feels like.
03:06:35.82 --> 03:06:40.82 People are afraid of what they don't know or what they don't understand,
03:06:40.82 --> 03:06:42.82 but you have prepared.
03:06:42.82 --> 03:06:46.82 You know it is safe, you know you are ready.
03:06:46.82 --> 03:06:50.82 It's just this last little bit of fear that has to be overcome.
03:06:50.82 --> 03:06:52.82 And you know how you do that?
03:06:52.82 --> 03:06:57.82 I have no idea, I told him, you go.
03:06:57.82 --> 03:07:00.82 Just go, I asked Uncle Jake,
03:07:00.82 --> 03:07:04.82 now partly thinking he was just joking, yes, you just go.
03:07:04.82 --> 03:07:06.82 You see fear lives in the moment,
03:07:06.82 --> 03:07:10.82 that powerful moment between when you decide you are going to do something
03:07:10.82 --> 03:07:12.82 and when you do it.
03:07:12.82 --> 03:07:16.82 Once you go, once you start, you won't be afraid anymore.
03:07:16.82 --> 03:07:19.82 You overcome fear by going.
03:07:19.82 --> 03:07:22.82 And it is the same in many aspects of life,
03:07:22.82 --> 03:07:24.82 parachuting, talking in front of a crowd,
03:07:24.82 --> 03:07:28.82 taking a test, running a race, competing in jujitsu.
03:07:28.82 --> 03:07:31.82 The fear is in the waiting.
03:07:31.82 --> 03:07:34.82 So, once you have planned,
03:07:34.82 --> 03:07:38.82 once you have prepared and trained and studied,
03:07:38.82 --> 03:07:41.82 there is only one thing left to do.
03:07:41.82 --> 03:07:43.82 Go.
03:07:43.82 --> 03:07:44.82 And that's it?
03:07:44.82 --> 03:07:47.82 Yes, that's it.
03:07:47.82 --> 03:07:49.82 As soon as Uncle Jake finished those words,
03:07:49.82 --> 03:07:52.82 he stood up, looked at me, yelled out,
03:07:52.82 --> 03:07:55.82 who y'all jumped off the bridge.
03:07:55.82 --> 03:07:58.82 Just go, I fought to myself.
03:07:58.82 --> 03:08:01.82 I stood up, stepped up onto the edge of the wall
03:08:01.82 --> 03:08:03.82 and looked down at Uncle Jake,
03:08:03.82 --> 03:08:04.82 who had just come back to the surface
03:08:04.82 --> 03:08:07.82 and was looking up at me with a big smile on his face.
03:08:07.82 --> 03:08:10.82 With all my heart and lungs, I yelled out,
03:08:10.82 --> 03:08:13.82 who y'all, and stepped off the bridge,
03:08:13.82 --> 03:08:16.82 passed my fear and into the unknown.
03:08:16.82 --> 03:08:19.82 I felt myself falling for a while
03:08:19.82 --> 03:08:22.82 and didn't wish I was in the water.
03:08:22.82 --> 03:08:26.82 I came to the surface and had a big smile on my face.
03:08:26.82 --> 03:08:31.82 I can fly, I yelled, I can fly.
03:08:31.82 --> 03:08:35.82 So, little excerpt.
03:08:35.82 --> 03:08:37.82 Dang, that was good, man.
03:08:37.82 --> 03:08:40.82 On the way of the warrior kid, it comes out May 2nd.
03:08:40.82 --> 03:08:46.82 So, go and go order the book for you,
03:08:46.82 --> 03:08:49.82 for your kid, for your neighbor, for your nephew,
03:08:49.82 --> 03:08:53.82 for your niece, for the school of library, whatever.
03:08:53.82 --> 03:08:57.82 Order them so the publisher, that's making this book.
03:08:57.82 --> 03:09:01.82 We want them to know that they need to print a bunch of these.
03:09:01.82 --> 03:09:03.82 They don't know that right now.
03:09:03.82 --> 03:09:06.82 They don't know how many kids want to get after it.
03:09:06.82 --> 03:09:09.82 They don't know that.
03:09:09.82 --> 03:09:11.82 They don't know that.
03:09:11.82 --> 03:09:13.82 And they're not going to print enough.
03:09:13.82 --> 03:09:16.82 It's the same thing that happened with Jockel White Team, right?
03:09:16.82 --> 03:09:17.82 You remember that?
03:09:17.82 --> 03:09:18.82 That's shortage.
03:09:18.82 --> 03:09:23.82 The anger of the frustration, the nation-wide-19% drop-in performance across the board.
03:09:23.82 --> 03:09:24.82 You remember that?
03:09:24.82 --> 03:09:26.82 Don't let it happen here, same thing.
03:09:26.82 --> 03:09:29.82 In order that, you can also pre-order,
03:09:29.82 --> 03:09:31.82 discipline equals freedom, field manual,
03:09:31.82 --> 03:09:35.82 comes out October 17th, 1717.
03:09:35.82 --> 03:09:42.82 Hmm, that's the book that you asked for.
03:09:42.82 --> 03:09:44.82 So you can order that one too, and of course,
03:09:44.82 --> 03:09:46.82 extreme ownership.
03:09:46.82 --> 03:09:48.82 You can get that one, people buy it,
03:09:48.82 --> 03:09:50.82 and then they buy it for their team, and it spreads.
03:09:50.82 --> 03:09:53.82 So pick that up for you and your team up and down the chain of command,
03:09:53.82 --> 03:09:55.82 extreme ownership.
03:09:55.82 --> 03:10:02.82 Beyond that, if you want some direct action and interaction with your company that you work out,

03:10:43.82 --> 03:10:48.82 there's just all of us together, getting after it.
03:10:48.82 --> 03:10:53.82 And of course, before the monster, you can find us.
03:10:53.82 --> 03:10:55.82 What are you cruising?

03:11:01.82 --> 03:11:05.82 and in the face, the book.
03:11:05.82 --> 03:11:12.82 Echo is at Echo Charles, and I am at Jockawilling.

03:11:34.82 --> 03:11:38.82 to face our enemies.
03:11:38.82 --> 03:11:46.82 Thank you, to the firefighters, police and law enforcement, EMTs, and the first responders here at home.

03:12:27.82 --> 03:12:41.82 And then keep moving forward, keep attacking, and keep getting after it.
