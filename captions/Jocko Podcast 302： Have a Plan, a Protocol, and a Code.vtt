00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.32
This is Jockelpawncast number 302.

2
00:00:04.32 --> 00:00:06.96
With echo-trolls and me, Jockel-Willink.

3
00:00:06.96 --> 00:00:09.56
Good evening, echo-good evening.

4
00:00:09.56 --> 00:00:13.56
Sir, we have a tick.

5
00:00:13.56 --> 00:00:19.84
As I quickly walk across our tactical operation center to the radio operator, I'm sure my heart

6
00:00:19.84 --> 00:00:21.44
rate spiked.

7
00:00:21.44 --> 00:00:27.04
A tick pronounced tick stands for troops in contact.

8
00:00:27.04 --> 00:00:32.08
It is something arresting everyone's attention because it meant one of our patrols was

9
00:00:32.08 --> 00:00:36.88
taking enemy fire on the mean streets of Ramadi.

10
00:00:36.88 --> 00:00:42.64
As I press the handset of the radio to my ear, I could hear a sense of urgency in the voice

11
00:00:42.64 --> 00:00:45.32
the patrol leader on the ground.

12
00:00:45.32 --> 00:00:50.000
He was leading a group of soldiers on a dismounted patrol on Ramadi's southwestern

13
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.08
side of town.

14
00:00:52.08 --> 00:00:55.28
Things could get kind of sporty there.

15
00:00:55.28 --> 00:01:00.76
The young sergeant leading the patrol was requesting I direct super-cober gunship helicopters

16
00:01:00.76 --> 00:01:05.92
to fire at insurgents on top of a building.

17
00:01:05.92 --> 00:01:10.24
They were engaged by insurgents with small arms from behind a building, but now he could

18
00:01:10.24 --> 00:01:13.96
see guns and other weapons on the roof.

19
00:01:13.96 --> 00:01:18.24
The insurgent had ceased for the moment, but the patrol leader was concerned about what

20
00:01:18.24 --> 00:01:22.04
might come next.

21
00:01:22.04 --> 00:01:24.80
Something did not feel right.

22
00:01:24.80 --> 00:01:27.80
It probably required a little more attention.

23
00:01:27.80 --> 00:01:34.80
I found the more experienced one gains, the more gut-feeling factors into decision-making.

24
00:01:34.80 --> 00:01:41.20
If something does not feel right, it probably requires a little more attention.

25
00:01:41.20 --> 00:01:45.08
I used a steady voice to calm the patrol leader down.

26
00:01:45.08 --> 00:01:50.80
I let him know I would call in the cobras, but first I needed him to provide positive

27
00:01:50.80 --> 00:01:56.72
identification of exactly who was on top of that building.

28
00:01:56.72 --> 00:02:01.48
My intuition was telling me to let the situation develop before calling in heavy fire

29
00:02:01.48 --> 00:02:03.84
power.

30
00:02:03.84 --> 00:02:08.80
After a few minutes, the patrol leader made a positive identification of the force on the

31
00:02:08.80 --> 00:02:11.40
rooftop.

32
00:02:11.40 --> 00:02:15.36
I was glad I did not pull the trigger on the cobras.

33
00:02:15.36 --> 00:02:22.28
A US Marine Corps civil affairs team were on the top of the building.

34
00:02:22.28 --> 00:02:24.64
A stressful situation was averted.

35
00:02:24.64 --> 00:02:28.04
Comeness and coolness prevailed.

36
00:02:28.04 --> 00:02:33.64
As it turned out, the small arms fire he received was some harassment fire and the insurgents

37
00:02:33.64 --> 00:02:41.16
who initiated the incident had quickly disappeared.

38
00:02:41.16 --> 00:02:48.000
So that right there is an excerpt from a book called Iron Sharpend Leadership, which was

39
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.60
written by General John Gronsky who served in the US Army and the National Guard for over

40
00:02:55.60 --> 00:02:57.000
40 years.

41
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.72
I have the honor of serving with him during the Battle of Ramadi.

42
00:03:00.72 --> 00:03:08.80
We are deployments overlapped by about a month or so in the spring of 2006.

43
00:03:08.80 --> 00:03:12.80
He has been on the podcast before, episode 235.

44
00:03:12.80 --> 00:03:17.96
If you haven't listened to that podcast yet, stop and go and listen to that one to get

45
00:03:17.96 --> 00:03:20.64
some background on General Gronsky.

46
00:03:20.64 --> 00:03:27.64
We are honored to have General Gronsky back again tonight to discuss his new book, which

47
00:03:27.64 --> 00:03:33.56
as I said is called Iron Sharpend Leadership and the subtitle is transforming hard-fought

48
00:03:33.56 --> 00:03:36.16
lessons into action.

49
00:03:36.16 --> 00:03:37.80
General Gronsky.

50
00:03:37.80 --> 00:03:38.80
That's again.

51
00:03:38.80 --> 00:03:39.80
Thank you for coming by.

52
00:03:39.80 --> 00:03:41.12
Hey, Jako, it's great to be with you.

53
00:03:41.12 --> 00:03:42.84
Thanks for inviting me.

54
00:03:42.84 --> 00:03:44.84
Always good to be here in San Diego.

55
00:03:44.84 --> 00:03:48.48
San Diego is not a bad place to be.

56
00:03:48.48 --> 00:03:53.98
So your first book that we touched upon on the last podcast, it was called The Ride of Our

57
00:03:53.98 --> 00:04:02.52
Lives and it was about a bike ride that you made across America with your wife and your infant

58
00:04:02.52 --> 00:04:09.68
child and you talked about some of the lessons that you learned along that voyage and the

59
00:04:09.68 --> 00:04:16.20
experience you had, but that was very early in your Army career and this is reflective

60
00:04:16.20 --> 00:04:18.52
of your entire Army career.

61
00:04:18.52 --> 00:04:21.72
So what made you decide to write this book, Iron Sharpend Leadership?

62
00:04:21.72 --> 00:04:27.08
Yeah, you know, Jako and I wrote that book the Ride of Our Lives near the end of the

63
00:04:27.08 --> 00:04:35.04
book, I put some just leadership lessons that I gained on that ride as you mentioned.

64
00:04:35.04 --> 00:04:42.58
And I actually had people asking me to expand on those lessons and the book focused

65
00:04:42.58 --> 00:04:47.96
just on that very short period of time, three months in 1983.

66
00:04:47.96 --> 00:04:54.22
And I just gained so much more experience and learned so many more lessons over the

67
00:04:54.22 --> 00:04:57.42
next 30 plus years.

68
00:04:57.42 --> 00:05:03.40
And I just felt compelled to put those lessons down in the writing and hopefully would

69
00:05:03.40 --> 00:05:08.94
help other people gain from really most of the mistakes I made along the way.

70
00:05:08.94 --> 00:05:14.98
Had you written the Ride of Our Lives in close proximity when it actually took place or

71
00:05:14.98 --> 00:05:15.98
was that?

72
00:05:15.98 --> 00:05:18.98
Did you remember back 30 years or whatever it was?

73
00:05:18.98 --> 00:05:24.000
Yeah, you know, Jako and I took that bike ride with my wife and 15 month old son

74
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
back in 1983.

75
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I kept the journal.

76
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Got it.

77
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.52
That journals sat in a shoe box for over 35 years.

78
00:05:32.52 --> 00:05:37.16
And then when I retired from the army in 2019, had a little bit of time on my hand.

79
00:05:37.16 --> 00:05:40.56
So I decided to write the book the Ride of Our Lives.

80
00:05:40.56 --> 00:05:48.44
And it was really meant to be for myself to reflect back on and for my family to have.

81
00:05:48.44 --> 00:05:55.56
And then I decided to self-publish it as a book and it turned out to be quite popular.

82
00:05:55.56 --> 00:05:56.56
Awesome.

83
00:05:56.56 --> 00:06:00.64
So this book, like you said, this is going back on your whole career and the lessons

84
00:06:00.64 --> 00:06:06.56
that you've learned and you've been through the entire leadership spectrum in the army

85
00:06:06.56 --> 00:06:09.60
and spent a bunch of time in combat.

86
00:06:09.60 --> 00:06:13.52
And so this is a great book and let's jump into it.

87
00:06:13.52 --> 00:06:18.000
So and just so everybody knows, look, if I have to skip around I'm not going to read the

88
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.28
whole book right now, there is an audio book version of this as well, but we're not going

89
00:06:22.28 --> 00:06:23.28
to read the whole thing.

90
00:06:23.28 --> 00:06:25.40
So I'm going to jump into some spots.

91
00:06:25.40 --> 00:06:29.64
It's obviously not going to be completely cohesive when we read it on the podcast.

92
00:06:29.64 --> 00:06:32.80
It's set up in a very cohesive manner in the way it's read.

93
00:06:32.80 --> 00:06:36.52
But I got to make that caveat before I start reading.

94
00:06:36.52 --> 00:06:38.72
But here's the one I want to start with.

95
00:06:38.72 --> 00:06:39.72
Going to the book.

96
00:06:39.72 --> 00:06:44.56
The last leadership advice was given to me by a crusty non-commissioned officer during my

97
00:06:44.56 --> 00:06:50.52
first experience in the army when I was training as an ROTC cadet at Fort Knox, Kentucky

98
00:06:50.52 --> 00:06:52.68
in 1976.

99
00:06:52.68 --> 00:06:55.20
I was a patrol leader during a training event.

100
00:06:55.20 --> 00:06:59.72
In the scenario, my patrol was passing through a cleared lane within a minefield.

101
00:06:59.72 --> 00:07:02.44
The lane was about 40 yards in length.

102
00:07:02.44 --> 00:07:08.20
As we began, as we were crossing the minefield on the cleared lane, we began to receive

103
00:07:08.20 --> 00:07:13.44
small arms fire from an enemy position about 200 yards away.

104
00:07:13.44 --> 00:07:15.08
I hesitated.

105
00:07:15.08 --> 00:07:19.68
The soldiers were waiting for a command I did not give.

106
00:07:19.68 --> 00:07:23.64
It took less than a minute for the enemy to destroy my entire patrol.

107
00:07:23.64 --> 00:07:30.20
The sergeant who was a seasoned Vietnam veteran pulled me aside and loudly advised

108
00:07:30.20 --> 00:07:34.08
when in charge, be in charge.

109
00:07:34.08 --> 00:07:41.20
The followers expect you to lead so you better damn well lead.

110
00:07:41.20 --> 00:07:42.84
Good lesson learned out of the gate.

111
00:07:42.84 --> 00:07:43.84
Yeah.

112
00:07:43.84 --> 00:07:51.36
Again, I could just say as I reflect back on my career, it was those non-commissioned officers,

113
00:07:51.36 --> 00:07:57.40
especially early on in my career, those Vietnam vets, who I was fortunate to be around and

114
00:07:57.40 --> 00:08:01.84
fortunate to get just some hard advice from.

115
00:08:01.84 --> 00:08:05.68
So punches pulled, this is the way it should be.

116
00:08:05.68 --> 00:08:10.20
So square yourself away and lead when you're in a leadership position.

117
00:08:10.20 --> 00:08:11.20
Yeah, you know what's thinking?

118
00:08:11.20 --> 00:08:17.76
In that particular case, and when I was running training, a lot of times the younger guys,

119
00:08:17.76 --> 00:08:23.92
the young seal officers, one thing that would happen to them would be, there would be

120
00:08:23.92 --> 00:08:28.88
a platoon chief for a leading petty officer that would get in the habit of making a lot

121
00:08:28.88 --> 00:08:30.08
of the calls.

122
00:08:30.08 --> 00:08:35.64
And so the officer would get in the habit of not making calls.

123
00:08:35.64 --> 00:08:38.40
And it was a, it wasn't even a fine line.

124
00:08:38.40 --> 00:08:44.60
What they had to realize was if one of the NCOs makes a call, awesome, you support their

125
00:08:44.60 --> 00:08:48.000
call, you're going to go, no factor, all good.

126
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.44
It's in those moments, those rare moments where, you know, in this particular case, maybe

127
00:08:52.44 --> 00:08:57.16
the NCO got hit with the first volley of fire or the NCO wasn't a position on the mine

128
00:08:57.16 --> 00:08:59.68
field where he could see where the fire was coming from.

129
00:08:59.68 --> 00:09:04.52
So they can't make a call or they're panicked or whatever the case may be.

130
00:09:04.52 --> 00:09:07.08
So you get that leadership vacuum.

131
00:09:07.08 --> 00:09:12.96
And that's when that officer has to be detached enough has to be heads up enough to go

132
00:09:12.96 --> 00:09:13.96
away to second.

133
00:09:13.96 --> 00:09:15.40
My NCOs aren't making a call.

134
00:09:15.40 --> 00:09:17.44
I need to lead right now.

135
00:09:17.44 --> 00:09:20.44
So it's a little bit of a cautionary tale too.

136
00:09:20.44 --> 00:09:26.04
You know, if when you're in charge, it doesn't necessarily mean you need to make the call,

137
00:09:26.04 --> 00:09:30.72
but you better be prepared in case, you know, the people, the your support in leadership

138
00:09:30.72 --> 00:09:31.96
doesn't make something happen.

139
00:09:31.96 --> 00:09:35.68
And in an ideal world, support in leadership makes call, you don't have to do anything.

140
00:09:35.68 --> 00:09:40.36
I hate to say it, but in an ideal world when you're in charge, you don't have to do anything.

141
00:09:40.36 --> 00:09:42.000
Yeah, ideally.

142
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.48
And you know, Jock, you speak to the fact that, you know, you have to put your followers

143
00:09:49.48 --> 00:09:53.80
into positions where they have that opportunity to make some of those tough calls.

144
00:09:53.80 --> 00:09:58.68
Now, I even think of this reflecting back, you know, my kids are both in their 30s now,

145
00:09:58.68 --> 00:10:04.04
but reflecting back when when my children were teenagers.

146
00:10:04.04 --> 00:10:09.80
And I really think it's important for parents to let young teenagers make decisions.

147
00:10:09.80 --> 00:10:13.44
Because if parents are making all the decisions for their kids, when are they going to

148
00:10:13.44 --> 00:10:15.24
learn how to make a decision?

149
00:10:15.24 --> 00:10:18.08
You know, they're going to learn how to make a decision when they become an adult.

150
00:10:18.08 --> 00:10:20.36
But that's kind of too late.

151
00:10:20.36 --> 00:10:25.36
So I do think you need to put your followers in positions where they gain that experience

152
00:10:25.36 --> 00:10:26.36
say.

153
00:10:26.36 --> 00:10:30.000
And if they make a mistake, you know, that's usually how we learn more is when we make

154
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.52
a mistake when then when we do something right by accident.

155
00:10:34.52 --> 00:10:39.12
Yeah, that's, I was going to say when you were saying, let your kids make decisions, let

156
00:10:39.12 --> 00:10:41.52
your kids make mistakes too.

157
00:10:41.52 --> 00:10:46.20
And just like in the military, this doesn't mean you're going to send a young, you know,

158
00:10:46.20 --> 00:10:50.28
they're going to get the first lieutenant out on an operation that they're not capable of conducting

159
00:10:50.28 --> 00:10:51.92
because they don't have the experience yet.

160
00:10:51.92 --> 00:10:52.92
They don't have the knowledge.

161
00:10:52.92 --> 00:10:54.72
You're not going to say, oh, let's see how it goes.

162
00:10:54.72 --> 00:10:55.72
No, you're not going to do that.

163
00:10:55.72 --> 00:10:58.68
Just like you're not going to say, oh, my kid wants to go play in the street, which is not

164
00:10:58.68 --> 00:11:00.32
a good decision where they could get hit by a card.

165
00:11:00.32 --> 00:11:02.16
And that's not what we're talking about.

166
00:11:02.16 --> 00:11:07.48
But you can certainly let them make decisions and let them brush up against the guard rails

167
00:11:07.48 --> 00:11:08.48
of failure.

168
00:11:08.48 --> 00:11:12.52
Because that's where you learn through those little scratches that you get on the body.

169
00:11:12.52 --> 00:11:13.52
Exactly.

170
00:11:13.52 --> 00:11:17.40
I'm going to fast forward a little bit.

171
00:11:17.40 --> 00:11:19.80
Because this section kind of sets up the rest of the book.

172
00:11:19.80 --> 00:11:24.44
My personal leadership philosophy is based on three elements of character, competence,

173
00:11:24.44 --> 00:11:26.08
and resilience.

174
00:11:26.08 --> 00:11:31.12
There are sub-components to each element of my leadership philosophy.

175
00:11:31.12 --> 00:11:35.88
Character, competence, resilience, and their sub-components are skills.

176
00:11:35.88 --> 00:11:40.64
And like any other skill, they can be learned in strength and although some may be born

177
00:11:40.64 --> 00:11:46.60
with higher levels of any one of these elements, everyone can improve them through training

178
00:11:46.60 --> 00:11:49.36
and practice.

179
00:11:49.36 --> 00:11:56.12
And this is something that I think there's a lot of people in the world that think that

180
00:11:56.12 --> 00:11:59.000
leadership is something you're born with.

181
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.60
Any of the you have it or you don't.

182
00:12:00.60 --> 00:12:05.60
And like you said, there are certainly, you might have some advantages in some areas.

183
00:12:05.60 --> 00:12:07.80
You might be pretty articulate.

184
00:12:07.80 --> 00:12:10.40
You might be pretty visionary.

185
00:12:10.40 --> 00:12:15.72
You might be have a good sense of other people's emotions.

186
00:12:15.72 --> 00:12:20.88
There's different levels that people have in all those categories.

187
00:12:20.88 --> 00:12:25.40
But no matter where you are in all these categories, you can improve upon them.

188
00:12:25.40 --> 00:12:26.40
Then you can get better.

189
00:12:26.40 --> 00:12:32.96
And I think a lot of people think, oh, leadership is just going to come through osmosis or

190
00:12:32.96 --> 00:12:33.96
something you're born with.

191
00:12:33.96 --> 00:12:35.56
And there's nothing you can do to actually train it.

192
00:12:35.56 --> 00:12:39.88
And the fact of the matter is there's 100% things that you can do to improve your leadership

193
00:12:39.88 --> 00:12:40.88
skills.

194
00:12:40.88 --> 00:12:41.88
Yeah.

195
00:12:41.88 --> 00:12:44.80
And I think it's like athleticism.

196
00:12:44.80 --> 00:12:50.16
Some people are born with better athletic skills than others.

197
00:12:50.16 --> 00:12:52.60
But everybody could improve in that athleticism.

198
00:12:52.60 --> 00:12:58.36
It doesn't mean everybody's going to be an NFL player or NBA player or whatever.

199
00:12:58.36 --> 00:12:59.84
But everybody could get better.

200
00:12:59.84 --> 00:13:02.32
And I feel the same way about leadership.

201
00:13:02.32 --> 00:13:06.48
And that's another reason why I wrote the book and just as you've written many leadership

202
00:13:06.48 --> 00:13:12.40
books to try to help people develop those skills that we know could be improved.

203
00:13:12.40 --> 00:13:13.40
Yeah.

204
00:13:13.40 --> 00:13:17.76
And that's the benefit of being in the military as you get to see over and over again,

205
00:13:17.76 --> 00:13:24.12
young leaders actually improve and get better and make better decisions and get more

206
00:13:24.12 --> 00:13:25.12
experience.

207
00:13:25.12 --> 00:13:28.44
So it's something that you and I through the blessing of being in the military got to see

208
00:13:28.44 --> 00:13:34.72
over and over again, it's fact, it's a fact that you know leaders can be improved.

209
00:13:34.72 --> 00:13:37.32
Let me get into these components here.

210
00:13:37.32 --> 00:13:40.08
The first one character, character is the root of leadership.

211
00:13:40.08 --> 00:13:44.72
A leader of character will be able to establish an environment of trust.

212
00:13:44.72 --> 00:13:50.20
A character based leader grows trust by trusting others first, providing a vision, displaying

213
00:13:50.20 --> 00:13:55.56
integrity, leading by example, and sincerely caring about others.

214
00:13:55.56 --> 00:13:58.52
The leader must have values and principles.

215
00:13:58.52 --> 00:14:03.64
Values are something a person believes in and will be guided by when times are good and

216
00:14:03.64 --> 00:14:05.12
when times are tough.

217
00:14:05.12 --> 00:14:10.76
A character based leader sincerely cares about those they lead and they place the interests

218
00:14:10.76 --> 00:14:16.84
of their followers above their own.

219
00:14:16.84 --> 00:14:18.88
The key component.

220
00:14:18.88 --> 00:14:27.92
I had a guy on this podcast by the name of General James Muka Yamma and he was, he served

221
00:14:27.92 --> 00:14:35.28
in Vietnam and he worked for Colonel David Hackworth when Hackworth was the Battalion Commander.

222
00:14:35.28 --> 00:14:40.96
Muka Yamma was one of his company commanders, but that was a point that he made so clear

223
00:14:40.96 --> 00:14:45.64
was that idea of you got to care about your people and that was a thing that Hackworth had.

224
00:14:45.64 --> 00:14:52.04
I don't know if it always comes across in his books and in writings, but Hackworth just

225
00:14:52.04 --> 00:14:56.000
cared about his soldiers and that elevated him so much and their eyes.

226
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.36
That's exactly what you're talking about here.

227
00:14:59.36 --> 00:15:03.56
It's easy to say.

228
00:15:03.56 --> 00:15:09.44
Care about your people that you lead, but I think extremely hard to do.

229
00:15:09.44 --> 00:15:13.40
To put the interest of those you lead before your own interest.

230
00:15:13.40 --> 00:15:18.88
I think the only people who could naturally do that are parents.

231
00:15:18.88 --> 00:15:24.92
I think parents could naturally put the interest of their kids before their own.

232
00:15:24.92 --> 00:15:30.76
To do that to people that are blood relatives of yours.

233
00:15:30.76 --> 00:15:37.000
That's a hard thing to do and I've been fortunate enough to be around leaders in the

234
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
military who had that ability to do that.

235
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.40
There's almost an innate sense they had to put the welfare of those they lead first.

236
00:15:47.40 --> 00:15:54.24
We learn this in the army and the Marines and the Navy, Air Force that leaders eat

237
00:15:54.24 --> 00:15:55.24
last.

238
00:15:55.24 --> 00:15:59.76
The reason we do that, you're going to imagine, you're out there either in a training

239
00:15:59.76 --> 00:16:06.36
environment or on operation, you get this child mermaided out to you in the field.

240
00:16:06.36 --> 00:16:11.12
So a journey, it's cold and if that leader jumps into child line first, it's probably

241
00:16:11.12 --> 00:16:15.20
whoever's going to be the last guy into child line, probably isn't going to eat or at least

242
00:16:15.20 --> 00:16:16.60
get a full portion.

243
00:16:16.60 --> 00:16:18.32
That's why leaders eat last.

244
00:16:18.32 --> 00:16:25.80
You want your folks that you lead to have the benefit of that nutrition before you suck

245
00:16:25.80 --> 00:16:27.80
it down.

246
00:16:27.80 --> 00:16:35.60
We learn this in the military and I think folks in the civilian sector, some know that

247
00:16:35.60 --> 00:16:41.84
kind of innately and others maybe never experience that and that's why I think there's

248
00:16:41.84 --> 00:16:48.92
some organizations that cannot develop that trust that is so essential if you're going

249
00:16:48.92 --> 00:16:54.72
to have an organization effectively run.

250
00:16:54.72 --> 00:17:03.000
Another thing about this is I think there's people who think that they can fool their troops

251
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:10.12
and their subordinate leadership into thinking that they care about them and I promise

252
00:17:10.12 --> 00:17:16.36
you having been a young and listed guy, having been the youngest and most junior guy in my

253
00:17:16.36 --> 00:17:23.24
first two silptuans, everybody can tell when you're looking out for yourself, everybody

254
00:17:23.24 --> 00:17:28.68
can tell, you're not fooling anyone and that's why the people that truly care about the

255
00:17:28.68 --> 00:17:33.96
team and put the team above themselves, that's why they wish I had.

256
00:17:33.96 --> 00:17:40.68
You think of examples that we've seen in the military, a leader who I remember when I was

257
00:17:40.68 --> 00:17:46.44
over in Ramadi, one of the platoon was getting some better version of an uparmer come

258
00:17:46.44 --> 00:17:50.64
V and the platoon leader refused to take that better version.

259
00:17:50.64 --> 00:17:57.44
He made sure this other soldiers in the platoon got that version before he would take it

260
00:17:57.44 --> 00:18:02.52
to write in himself and that's putting yourself more at risk for the benefit of those

261
00:18:02.52 --> 00:18:03.52
your leads.

262
00:18:03.52 --> 00:18:08.000
There's a perfect example of how one could do that, especially if it means putting your

263
00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.04
life at risk, this guy was a true leader.

264
00:18:11.04 --> 00:18:17.60
100% no that's an outstanding example right there.

265
00:18:17.60 --> 00:18:20.12
Next thing, next character is to competence.

266
00:18:20.12 --> 00:18:23.64
When I talk about competence being an element of leadership, I am not referring to the

267
00:18:23.64 --> 00:18:29.04
tactical competence in a specific job, I am referring to the general competence of a person

268
00:18:29.04 --> 00:18:30.76
to lead others.

269
00:18:30.76 --> 00:18:36.80
Many elements make up competence, but the most imperative are providing a vision and purpose

270
00:18:36.80 --> 00:18:41.92
for the organization, decision making, developing others and communication.

271
00:18:41.92 --> 00:18:48.52
A leader must be able to articulate a vision which is simple, unique, ideal image of the future.

272
00:18:48.52 --> 00:18:52.76
Leaders must explain the why behind the vision and tell the followers what they believe

273
00:18:52.76 --> 00:18:54.000
in.

274
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.64
When leaders provide vision and purpose, they instill confidence and provide inspiration

275
00:18:58.64 --> 00:19:02.48
that fuels an organization and powering it to success.

276
00:19:02.48 --> 00:19:07.96
A leader must learn and apply problem-solving skills and decision-making processes.

277
00:19:07.96 --> 00:19:11.72
A leader also must possess the courage to decide.

278
00:19:11.72 --> 00:19:15.64
One of the most important roles of a leader is to develop other leaders.

279
00:19:15.64 --> 00:19:20.44
A leader must mentor and coach must be a mentor and coach willing to take others assigned

280
00:19:20.44 --> 00:19:23.52
and provide insight into what it means to be a leader.

281
00:19:23.52 --> 00:19:27.88
A leader must communicate in clear, concise and respectful manner.

282
00:19:27.88 --> 00:19:31.60
Most leaders spend between 70 and 90% of their time communicating.

283
00:19:31.60 --> 00:19:36.44
It is important for a leader to develop listening skills and the ability to get a consistent

284
00:19:36.44 --> 00:19:40.000
message out to all stakeholders.

285
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.52
So that's the competency of being a leader, all these skills that you list in here.

286
00:19:45.52 --> 00:19:51.16
But again, what's interesting about these skills is, if you scan through them, can you

287
00:19:51.16 --> 00:19:55.20
get better at explaining the vision?

288
00:19:55.20 --> 00:19:56.20
Yes, you can.

289
00:19:56.20 --> 00:19:58.20
Can you get better at decision-making?

290
00:19:58.20 --> 00:19:59.20
Yes, you can.

291
00:19:59.20 --> 00:20:00.20
Can you get better at problem-solving?

292
00:20:00.20 --> 00:20:01.20
Yes, you can.

293
00:20:01.20 --> 00:20:02.72
Can you get better at decision-making?

294
00:20:02.72 --> 00:20:03.72
Yes, you can.

295
00:20:03.72 --> 00:20:04.72
Can you get better at mentoring?

296
00:20:04.72 --> 00:20:05.72
Yes, you can.

297
00:20:05.72 --> 00:20:06.72
Every one of these can.

298
00:20:06.72 --> 00:20:11.04
You get better at communicating in simple, clear, concise language, respectful manner.

299
00:20:11.04 --> 00:20:12.44
Yes, you can.

300
00:20:12.44 --> 00:20:18.60
And you're talking about here with the competence of a leader is something that you can

301
00:20:18.60 --> 00:20:19.60
improve upon.

302
00:20:19.60 --> 00:20:20.60
Yeah.

303
00:20:20.60 --> 00:20:23.48
And the book is people go through it.

304
00:20:23.48 --> 00:20:30.12
They'll see there's stories associated with these lessons that I've learned.

305
00:20:30.12 --> 00:20:35.16
And then there's certain actions I've found through my experience over the last 40 years

306
00:20:35.16 --> 00:20:41.48
that help one get better and stronger at these particular skills that you mentioned.

307
00:20:41.48 --> 00:20:45.68
Yeah, so just to make that clear, because I don't know how much I did it my notes, but you

308
00:20:45.68 --> 00:20:50.40
broke the book down almost like a military learning manual where, hey, here's the actions

309
00:20:50.40 --> 00:20:52.72
that you need to take if you want to improve in these areas.

310
00:20:52.72 --> 00:20:53.72
And I know I don't hate them.

311
00:20:53.72 --> 00:20:59.80
I think I hate a couple of them, but that's what that's the way the book is broken down.

312
00:20:59.80 --> 00:21:04.16
The last thing is resilience.

313
00:21:04.16 --> 00:21:07.96
Anyone who has ever led anything will tell you that at some point in time the organization

314
00:21:07.96 --> 00:21:09.52
you lead will face adversity.

315
00:21:09.52 --> 00:21:14.60
So that may matter every living person faces adversity at some point in their lives.

316
00:21:14.60 --> 00:21:22.36
It all comes down to how prepared one is to face these challenges and how one responds.

317
00:21:22.36 --> 00:21:26.80
Leaders must prepare themselves and give their followers and their followers to overcome

318
00:21:26.80 --> 00:21:27.80
challenges.

319
00:21:27.80 --> 00:21:32.000
Positive energy is essential when leading a large organization or a small team.

320
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.72
Optimism and enthusiasm are two key traits of a resilient person.

321
00:21:36.72 --> 00:21:42.60
Like any other trait, they must be exercised to become a strong part of one's makeup.

322
00:21:42.60 --> 00:21:46.72
A leader must be physically, emotionally, mentally and spiritually fit.

323
00:21:46.72 --> 00:21:52.04
To strengthen resilience, leaders must follow themselves, must allow themselves to be vulnerable

324
00:21:52.04 --> 00:21:58.16
by moving out of their comfort zone, by taking risks and taking on tough challenges, scar tissue

325
00:21:58.16 --> 00:22:02.84
is developed and resilience is improved.

326
00:22:02.84 --> 00:22:08.44
So the person that's going to lead had better be able to get back up again if they get knocked

327
00:22:08.44 --> 00:22:09.44
out.

328
00:22:09.44 --> 00:22:14.36
And you know, Jaco, I think resilience is something that has been talked about a lot over

329
00:22:14.36 --> 00:22:17.28
the last few years.

330
00:22:17.28 --> 00:22:23.96
But resilience, I don't believe resilience actually just happens by itself.

331
00:22:23.96 --> 00:22:29.60
You've got to train to become a resilient person by doing certain things that you just

332
00:22:29.60 --> 00:22:33.20
mentioned, you know, moving out of your comfort zone.

333
00:22:33.20 --> 00:22:41.40
I mean, if you're a leader or a person who just wants to take the easy way of just staying

334
00:22:41.40 --> 00:22:46.96
in your comfort zone, doing things that you know how to do, never stretching yourself, never

335
00:22:46.96 --> 00:22:50.48
putting yourself in a position where you might make a mistake because you think you're

336
00:22:50.48 --> 00:22:54.80
going to look bad in front of your followers or your peers or whoever.

337
00:22:54.80 --> 00:22:56.52
You're not going to grow that way.

338
00:22:56.52 --> 00:23:03.16
And then when tough times do happen, you're going to be less likely to demonstrate the

339
00:23:03.16 --> 00:23:09.80
resiliency that's needed in order to help your organization get through those tough times.

340
00:23:09.80 --> 00:23:13.64
Reminds me talking to some of the tankers.

341
00:23:13.64 --> 00:23:17.44
Actually, this was the one, one AD that replaced you guys and Ramadi.

342
00:23:17.44 --> 00:23:22.12
But one thing that I found interesting was that they do, and it was actually a guy named

343
00:23:22.12 --> 00:23:26.40
Mike Bima who was the company commander, fantastic guy.

344
00:23:26.40 --> 00:23:30.20
But he was explaining to me what they do to prepare for deployment, what do they do things

345
00:23:30.20 --> 00:23:34.20
that they do to prepare for deployment is they bring their tank on this tank range, and

346
00:23:34.20 --> 00:23:38.40
they do gunnery where you're shooting and you're moving and maneuvering the tank and doing

347
00:23:38.40 --> 00:23:40.96
comms and reloading.

348
00:23:40.96 --> 00:23:42.32
And it's a challenge.

349
00:23:42.32 --> 00:23:48.32
It's like a, I guess for an infantry guy or for a seal, it's like doing a combat conditioning

350
00:23:48.32 --> 00:23:52.28
course where you run, you shoot, you got head plates, you got long distance shot to take,

351
00:23:52.28 --> 00:23:55.04
you got to do pull ups and rope climbs, you got to shoot more.

352
00:23:55.04 --> 00:23:57.32
It's like that, but it's an tank.

353
00:23:57.32 --> 00:24:02.72
And one thing that he said to me was when they go do gunnery, the first person that goes

354
00:24:02.72 --> 00:24:03.72
is the tying commander.

355
00:24:03.72 --> 00:24:04.72
Exactly.

356
00:24:04.72 --> 00:24:06.64
That's the example, hey, this, I'm going first.

357
00:24:06.64 --> 00:24:09.84
And so what you're talking about getting out of your comfort zone, I can't imagine

358
00:24:09.84 --> 00:24:13.80
a lot of those tanker, those tank battalion commanders, they probably been out of the tank

359
00:24:13.80 --> 00:24:14.80
for a while.

360
00:24:14.80 --> 00:24:16.96
And yet they're going to step up and they're going to show, okay, this is it.

361
00:24:16.96 --> 00:24:17.96
This is what we do.

362
00:24:17.96 --> 00:24:18.96
Yeah.

363
00:24:18.96 --> 00:24:24.52
And, you know, you kind of reminded me of something that I wouldn't mind sharing with you

364
00:24:24.52 --> 00:24:30.04
because I think it's kind of a great lesson in resiliency.

365
00:24:30.04 --> 00:24:32.92
And this goes back to Ramadi.

366
00:24:32.92 --> 00:24:38.64
I had a national, you know, one of our national guard tank companies when we're training

367
00:24:38.64 --> 00:24:44.60
at Camp Shell, it'll be before going over to Iraq.

368
00:24:44.60 --> 00:24:48.76
This company has three platoons and one of their platoons went through that tank

369
00:24:48.76 --> 00:24:53.64
undery that you just talked about, only one of their platoons dead.

370
00:24:53.64 --> 00:24:59.72
And when they got over to Ramadi, we actually task organized them to two, six, nine armor,

371
00:24:59.72 --> 00:25:03.64
which was an Easter mighty combat outpost-corrigator area.

372
00:25:03.64 --> 00:25:10.32
And since two, six, nine armor was an armor battalion, they didn't need this company to

373
00:25:10.32 --> 00:25:13.44
operate in tanks, so they made them motorized infantry.

374
00:25:13.44 --> 00:25:18.08
So they operated as motorized infantry for the first, the first, six months, they're over

375
00:25:18.08 --> 00:25:23.60
in Ramadi, and then two, six, nine armor leaves, and they get replaced by first, at a

376
00:25:23.60 --> 00:25:28.64
506 infantry from the 101st Airborne, light infantry.

377
00:25:28.64 --> 00:25:31.44
But tanks were still needed in Easter mighty.

378
00:25:31.44 --> 00:25:37.36
So now these national guard soldiers who were tankers, operating as motorized infantry

379
00:25:37.36 --> 00:25:41.96
for the previous six months, are now in tanks.

380
00:25:41.96 --> 00:25:48.80
And they just did a remarkable job, they had several main gun engagements while they were

381
00:25:48.80 --> 00:25:56.36
over there, and it just goes to show you how by training to be resilient and training

382
00:25:56.36 --> 00:25:58.12
in those skills.

383
00:25:58.12 --> 00:26:03.40
Even when you're taken out of that particular job in a combat situation for six months,

384
00:26:03.40 --> 00:26:08.64
and then having to go back into those tanks again, and then just performing remarkably,

385
00:26:08.64 --> 00:26:15.12
I think is just a great story of not only resiliency, but adaptability.

386
00:26:15.12 --> 00:26:20.68
I think that's something that has made the seal team successful, and it starts in the basic

387
00:26:20.68 --> 00:26:22.08
seal training.

388
00:26:22.08 --> 00:26:25.44
And I always say that, hey, you know, the basic seal training, you don't really learn anything,

389
00:26:25.44 --> 00:26:27.48
because you're just doing push ups and being wet, cold and miserable.

390
00:26:27.48 --> 00:26:31.72
You learn how to suffer, and if you don't like to suffer, you're not going to be there.

391
00:26:31.72 --> 00:26:34.72
But one thing I will say is, you're going to totally chaos.

392
00:26:34.72 --> 00:26:38.12
Well, it's total chaos when you're there.

393
00:26:38.12 --> 00:26:42.28
Everything that happens, I mean, you go out, you go out, your boats in the ocean, and they're

394
00:26:42.28 --> 00:26:46.12
getting flipped over, and you're getting washed up on, and people are confused, lost, you've

395
00:26:46.12 --> 00:26:48.72
got cam lights, bouncing all over the place.

396
00:26:48.72 --> 00:26:53.96
When hell week kicks off, there's just total chaos, confusion, there's throwing smoke grenades,

397
00:26:53.96 --> 00:26:57.20
everywhere, you can't see anything, there's machine guns going off, you can't hear anything.

398
00:26:57.20 --> 00:26:58.72
And it's just like that all the time.

399
00:26:58.72 --> 00:27:02.80
So you get used to this environment where there's total chaos going on, and you have to figure

400
00:27:02.80 --> 00:27:03.80
out you have to adapt.

401
00:27:03.80 --> 00:27:08.12
And then when I got to the Syltimes, and it's not so much like this anymore, but it still

402
00:27:08.12 --> 00:27:16.76
does have this, still does have this, this DNA, which is, there was no doctrine when I got

403
00:27:16.76 --> 00:27:17.76
the Syltimes.

404
00:27:17.76 --> 00:27:22.64
If you want to do a raid, if someone didn't tell you if your platoon chief didn't know how

405
00:27:22.64 --> 00:27:24.88
to do a raid, you had to just figure it out.

406
00:27:24.88 --> 00:27:25.88
And there's good and bad to that.

407
00:27:25.88 --> 00:27:27.12
I mean, it's kind of good in the army.

408
00:27:27.12 --> 00:27:29.56
You want to do a raid, you can pick up the, what is it?

409
00:27:29.56 --> 00:27:32.76
Seven taxics and triple tune and squad you can figure out how to do a raid.

410
00:27:32.76 --> 00:27:34.44
It tells everybody what they need to do.

411
00:27:34.44 --> 00:27:35.84
Syltimes doesn't have that.

412
00:27:35.84 --> 00:27:37.80
And so you just go, okay, well, what makes sense?

413
00:27:37.80 --> 00:27:39.44
How can we do this?

414
00:27:39.44 --> 00:27:41.60
And like I said, there's some good to that.

415
00:27:41.60 --> 00:27:45.000
There's some bad to that because now you might not come up with a best plan, but there's also

416
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.76
some good because you're constantly learning to adapt.

417
00:27:47.76 --> 00:27:50.76
And I think that's one of the things, and it's, look, the whole, I'm, I'm saying that

418
00:27:50.76 --> 00:27:52.36
about the Syltimes because that's my environment.

419
00:27:52.36 --> 00:27:55.32
But the military in general does that, and that's exactly what you're talking about.

420
00:27:55.32 --> 00:28:00.72
You take guys, you train them in one aspect of combat.

421
00:28:00.72 --> 00:28:03.96
You take them on deployment, you put them into a totally different aspect of combat.

422
00:28:03.96 --> 00:28:05.16
They perform.

423
00:28:05.16 --> 00:28:07.96
And then halfway through you switch them back to the original thing and they get back

424
00:28:07.96 --> 00:28:09.36
on that horse and do it again.

425
00:28:09.36 --> 00:28:10.80
Or in this case, get back on those tanks.

426
00:28:10.80 --> 00:28:11.80
Yeah, I do it again.

427
00:28:11.80 --> 00:28:12.96
Yeah.

428
00:28:12.96 --> 00:28:22.80
And you know, I remember when we got over the brigade, I was part of, got over to Ramadi in 2005,

429
00:28:22.80 --> 00:28:25.40
coin doctrine wasn't written yet.

430
00:28:25.40 --> 00:28:34.000
And coin doctrine wasn't written by General Patreus in General Madison, until early 2006, really.

431
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.72
And so there was no coin academy that, you know, leader, that leader from I brigade went

432
00:28:40.72 --> 00:28:48.60
to when we got to Iraq, but I think 2006, 2007, and after that, any brigade that got deployed

433
00:28:48.60 --> 00:28:54.40
Iraq went through this thing called the coin academy, the counter insurgency academy.

434
00:28:54.40 --> 00:28:57.28
And so we kind of had to figure it out on her own.

435
00:28:57.28 --> 00:29:00.88
And when you figure it out, you know, you read history.

436
00:29:00.88 --> 00:29:03.08
You see how it was done in the past.

437
00:29:03.08 --> 00:29:05.56
You just use some common sense.

438
00:29:05.56 --> 00:29:12.000
You talk to leaders that you respect and that you count on and you kind of figured out.

439
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.56
And that was the interesting thing that was done there, you know, brigade of 5,000 soldiers

440
00:29:16.56 --> 00:29:17.84
and Marines.

441
00:29:17.84 --> 00:29:23.72
But a lot of the operations were occurring at the platoon and company level.

442
00:29:23.72 --> 00:29:27.96
So it's not like, you know, because I was a brigade commander, I was directing some type

443
00:29:27.96 --> 00:29:31.16
of large brigade operation that didn't exist.

444
00:29:31.16 --> 00:29:34.76
They were all done at very small unit levels.

445
00:29:34.76 --> 00:29:42.24
And just an amazing thing about our American, you know, servicemen and women.

446
00:29:42.24 --> 00:29:43.24
They figured out.

447
00:29:43.24 --> 00:29:44.24
They have a way to figure it out.

448
00:29:44.24 --> 00:29:50.04
And I think if you read history of the military, which I know you do when you read

449
00:29:50.04 --> 00:29:58.88
on your podcast regularly, it's just amazing how we have, you know, her American military

450
00:29:58.88 --> 00:30:01.28
has just figured things out as we went.

451
00:30:01.28 --> 00:30:11.36
Yeah, I don't even remember because the first, I arrived in the normal in April of 2006.

452
00:30:11.36 --> 00:30:19.000
I visited one of my friends who was an Intel officer at one of the bases.

453
00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
And in Ramadi and she had the big targeting board.

454
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.24
And I had worked with her before.

455
00:30:26.24 --> 00:30:30.64
She had that big targeting board board when I was in Iraq before, the same big targeting

456
00:30:30.64 --> 00:30:31.64
board.

457
00:30:31.64 --> 00:30:34.84
I was like, man, this is, this is not a good sign because if we're just going to be targeting

458
00:30:34.84 --> 00:30:38.52
these people and this is, this board is just as big as it was when I left.

459
00:30:38.52 --> 00:30:39.76
Yeah.

460
00:30:39.76 --> 00:30:44.84
And I went back to my talk, my tackle operations center and I googled, I think I must have

461
00:30:44.84 --> 00:30:48.24
heard something about this new counterinsertancy manual.

462
00:30:48.24 --> 00:30:51.80
And I googled it and it was on, it was a draft copy because it didn't even get released

463
00:30:51.80 --> 00:30:52.80
yet.

464
00:30:52.80 --> 00:30:55.48
It was a draft copy that I got and I was just like, okay, this is it.

465
00:30:55.48 --> 00:31:00.32
And I found it on, I forget those websites, those, uh, there's a couple websites.

466
00:31:00.32 --> 00:31:03.76
I want to say one of them was like global security dot org.

467
00:31:03.76 --> 00:31:07.26
Maybe I found out, but it was on one of those websites that I used to read about what was

468
00:31:07.26 --> 00:31:13.16
happening in the world, sort of from a, from a military geopolitical perspective.

469
00:31:13.16 --> 00:31:14.24
Also as a bunch of manuals.

470
00:31:14.24 --> 00:31:21.04
So we had the new FM3 tech 24 counterinsertancy and I, I literally read it that like that

471
00:31:21.04 --> 00:31:23.56
night day, it's pretty long.

472
00:31:23.56 --> 00:31:25.56
And I just pluck things from it.

473
00:31:25.56 --> 00:31:26.56
Yeah.

474
00:31:26.56 --> 00:31:28.56
And realized, okay, this is what we need to do.

475
00:31:28.56 --> 00:31:34.32
And I remember, I, I know I, I stole from it because I remember my boss saying, you know,

476
00:31:34.32 --> 00:31:37.92
what's your objective in these types of operations and I said, provide security for the

477
00:31:37.92 --> 00:31:40.08
populace, which I know I didn't make that up on my own.

478
00:31:40.08 --> 00:31:45.08
I didn't come up with that.

479
00:31:45.08 --> 00:31:46.76
That's 100% stolen from from the counterinsertancy manual.

480
00:31:46.76 --> 00:31:50.80
And that's what, that's what kind of drove me in that direction of like, hey, how can

481
00:31:50.80 --> 00:31:57.24
we really help the broader conventional forces that are here as, as they start to move in

482
00:31:57.24 --> 00:31:59.000
and try and stabilize what's happening?

483
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.40
Yeah, you know, it's, it's, it's funny you mentioned that because we, we kind of evolved

484
00:32:04.40 --> 00:32:08.56
and, and I read somewhere or somebody told me, you know, you can't kill yourself out of

485
00:32:08.56 --> 00:32:10.56
an insurgency.

486
00:32:10.56 --> 00:32:16.36
And we, when we first got there, you know, our mission was to, you know, kill them

487
00:32:16.36 --> 00:32:17.64
surgeons.

488
00:32:17.64 --> 00:32:24.44
And we evolved into protecting the populace because we realized, you know, the main, the main

489
00:32:24.44 --> 00:32:32.84
goal here is to protect the populace in order to change chaos into something that was

490
00:32:32.84 --> 00:32:35.64
going to become or than chaos there.

491
00:32:35.64 --> 00:32:42.28
And so the same type of thinking you had about, you know, your mission of protecting the,

492
00:32:42.28 --> 00:32:50.28
the people of Ramadi, we, we kind of evolved into that too from, again, reading history,

493
00:32:50.28 --> 00:32:56.80
talking to some of the Iraqi leaders in Ramadi that we would be dealing with on a regular

494
00:32:56.80 --> 00:32:57.80
basis.

495
00:32:57.80 --> 00:33:02.32
And, and we came to the conclusion that, hey, if we're going to be successful here, it's

496
00:33:02.32 --> 00:33:06.000
about protecting the populace, not not not simply killing the bad guys.

497
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.16
Now, sometimes you would have to kill bad guys in order to protect the populace.

498
00:33:10.16 --> 00:33:13.36
So I'm not saying, you know, that was totally off the table.

499
00:33:13.36 --> 00:33:18.88
But the mindset completely changed for us throughout that one year that we conducted operations

500
00:33:18.88 --> 00:33:19.88
there.

501
00:33:19.88 --> 00:33:20.88
Yeah.

502
00:33:20.88 --> 00:33:23.88
Awesome stuff.

503
00:33:23.88 --> 00:33:28.44
Getting back to the book here.

504
00:33:28.44 --> 00:33:33.20
You say discipline, respect, and selflessness are part of the United States Army's DNA

505
00:33:33.20 --> 00:33:38.04
forged over 200 years ago during the training of the continental army at Valley Forge,

506
00:33:38.04 --> 00:33:39.04
Pennsylvania.

507
00:33:39.04 --> 00:33:41.20
You throwing Pennsylvania any chance you get.

508
00:33:41.20 --> 00:33:42.20
Can't don't you.

509
00:33:42.20 --> 00:33:43.20
I got to.

510
00:33:43.20 --> 00:33:44.20
Yeah.

511
00:33:44.20 --> 00:33:48.28
These traits have served our military well and account, at least in part, for the reason

512
00:33:48.28 --> 00:33:52.68
the United States military always tops polls announcing the most trusted organizations in

513
00:33:52.68 --> 00:33:53.68
America.

514
00:33:53.68 --> 00:33:59.48
Any leader would do well to demonstrate the traits of self discipline, respect for others,

515
00:33:59.48 --> 00:34:05.08
and selflessness in order to lead effectively.

516
00:34:05.08 --> 00:34:11.92
Now you got a story in here about, was it Sergeant Mike Kacher, Mike Kacher, tell us that

517
00:34:11.92 --> 00:34:12.92
story.

518
00:34:12.92 --> 00:34:13.92
Yeah.

519
00:34:13.92 --> 00:34:18.76
Mike is an amazing person.

520
00:34:18.76 --> 00:34:27.52
Mike Kacher was a soldier in the Pennsylvania National Guard 28th Infantry Division who was

521
00:34:27.52 --> 00:34:30.20
deployed to Afghanistan.

522
00:34:30.20 --> 00:34:39.04
While he was in Afghanistan, a rocket came in, this rocket landed about 10 feet away from him.

523
00:34:39.04 --> 00:34:43.40
It just caused significant wounds to Mike Kacher.

524
00:34:43.40 --> 00:34:54.36
Mike is jaw, internal bleeding and damages, and then his left arm was wounded so significantly

525
00:34:54.36 --> 00:34:57.12
that it had to be amputated.

526
00:34:57.12 --> 00:34:59.12
And they were treating him.

527
00:34:59.12 --> 00:35:05.56
He was eventually putting in a coma, and then induced coma, and it took him two years

528
00:35:05.56 --> 00:35:11.64
to recover from these very, very significant wounds that he had.

529
00:35:11.64 --> 00:35:18.12
And he had a lot of deal with, obviously, recovering from these wounds, losing his arm,

530
00:35:18.12 --> 00:35:20.08
et cetera, et cetera.

531
00:35:20.08 --> 00:35:28.04
And he decided that the way he was going to overcome this adversity that he was facing

532
00:35:28.04 --> 00:35:33.72
was to just build himself up physically and compete in physical competition.

533
00:35:33.72 --> 00:35:38.04
And so he decided to enter the Invictus Games.

534
00:35:38.04 --> 00:35:46.08
And then Invictus Games were created, I think, by Prince Harry, if I'm not mistaken.

535
00:35:46.08 --> 00:35:53.12
And it was all about bringing wounded warriors together to compete in Olympic style competition.

536
00:35:53.12 --> 00:35:58.32
And so I believe it was in 2018, and Sidney Australia, when Mike was competing in his

537
00:35:58.32 --> 00:36:03.08
third Invictus game, as he was competing in some track and field of vans.

538
00:36:03.08 --> 00:36:08.32
He noticed the shun girl about eight years old in the stands.

539
00:36:08.32 --> 00:36:11.08
And she was kind of shadowing him.

540
00:36:11.08 --> 00:36:15.12
Whatever event he would go to compete in, she would kind of move or see him come over and

541
00:36:15.12 --> 00:36:16.12
watch him.

542
00:36:16.12 --> 00:36:19.68
And then he realized she had one arm.

543
00:36:19.68 --> 00:36:27.44
And when it came time for him to receive his silver medal that he earned, he asked

544
00:36:27.44 --> 00:36:30.000
Jim to come up on the podium with him.

545
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.44
And when he was given the silver medal, he took it from around his neck and put it around

546
00:36:34.44 --> 00:36:41.28
Jim's neck and gifted the silver medal that he worked so hard for to the shung eight

547
00:36:41.28 --> 00:36:43.60
year old Australian girl.

548
00:36:43.60 --> 00:36:52.04
And I had the opportunity to email back and forth with Jim as father, who, again, is Australian.

549
00:36:52.04 --> 00:36:58.16
And he went on to tell me how that had just completely changed Jim's life.

550
00:36:58.16 --> 00:37:03.36
But other interesting thing he told me, he said, you know, Jim as arm was not amputated.

551
00:37:03.36 --> 00:37:04.76
She was born without that arm.

552
00:37:04.76 --> 00:37:09.84
And he said, and there's a psychological difference between having your arm amputated or

553
00:37:09.84 --> 00:37:11.32
being born without an arm.

554
00:37:11.32 --> 00:37:15.08
So he made that distinction clear to me.

555
00:37:15.08 --> 00:37:21.28
And he went on to say that, you know, from Mike doing that, what Mike probably thought was

556
00:37:21.28 --> 00:37:24.84
a very simple gesture.

557
00:37:24.84 --> 00:37:28.88
It just dramatically changed Jim as life.

558
00:37:28.88 --> 00:37:35.40
And now she's competing in sports as a matter of fact, I see pictures of her on Instagram,

559
00:37:35.40 --> 00:37:37.96
where she's winning swim meets.

560
00:37:37.96 --> 00:37:45.000
And she's just ready to tear it up because of this very simple leadership gesture that

561
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:48.04
that Mike caught your demonstrated to her.

562
00:37:48.04 --> 00:37:54.72
And it just goes to show you that the simple things we do in life as leaders have a profound

563
00:37:54.72 --> 00:37:59.72
effect on those that we do those things for.

564
00:37:59.72 --> 00:38:03.72
And you know, it's similar to the butterfly effect.

565
00:38:03.72 --> 00:38:07.72
You know, this could have a generational impact.

566
00:38:07.72 --> 00:38:12.72
I don't want to sound too dramatic here, but it could have a generational impact on

567
00:38:12.72 --> 00:38:13.72
Gemma.

568
00:38:13.72 --> 00:38:17.96
And on Gemma's children, if she has children someday, et cetera, et cetera, just because

569
00:38:17.96 --> 00:38:21.68
of that very selfless act that Mike caught you in.

570
00:38:21.68 --> 00:38:25.24
And you got to realize, you know, you were a car to get the silver medal.

571
00:38:25.24 --> 00:38:30.64
You know, I mean, just to give it away like that, the somebody that you don't really know

572
00:38:30.64 --> 00:38:32.04
was quite a gesture.

573
00:38:32.04 --> 00:38:34.44
So that's that's the story about Mike.

574
00:38:34.44 --> 00:38:40.12
Yeah, I can only imagine a young girl like that and, you know, young girls and boys,

575
00:38:40.12 --> 00:38:44.44
but I would, I've got three daughters and one son and I would say that girls are really

576
00:38:44.44 --> 00:38:49.28
self-conscious about, you know, those kind of things, their body, their self-conscious

577
00:38:49.28 --> 00:38:55.000
about that and you could imagine someone like Gemma who's sort of avoiding any time where

578
00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.04
all of a sudden this becomes the focus is that what's different about her and him just

579
00:39:01.04 --> 00:39:02.44
coming along and saying, yeah, it's cool.

580
00:39:02.44 --> 00:39:03.44
Yeah.

581
00:39:03.44 --> 00:39:04.44
It's good.

582
00:39:04.44 --> 00:39:05.44
Don't worry about it.

583
00:39:05.44 --> 00:39:06.44
Go do your thing.

584
00:39:06.44 --> 00:39:07.44
That just changed your life.

585
00:39:07.44 --> 00:39:08.44
That's awesome to hear.

586
00:39:08.44 --> 00:39:09.44
Yeah.

587
00:39:09.44 --> 00:39:10.44
Yeah.

588
00:39:10.44 --> 00:39:13.28
You wrap up this idea here.

589
00:39:13.28 --> 00:39:14.76
You say self-discipline.

590
00:39:14.76 --> 00:39:16.72
Giving up could become a habit.

591
00:39:16.72 --> 00:39:20.16
Giving up to the same hard and striving continually to get better is also habit.

592
00:39:20.16 --> 00:39:23.68
Habits are developed through repetition and where self-discipline comes in.

593
00:39:23.68 --> 00:39:29.84
Leaders who are self-disciplined adhere to the same standards they have set for their followers.

594
00:39:29.84 --> 00:39:34.48
They lead by example and share hardships, struggles and tough jobs with their followers.

595
00:39:34.48 --> 00:39:39.40
By the way, adhering to the same standards you expect from others and sharing the load

596
00:39:39.40 --> 00:39:45.28
are two of several actions a leader must take to instill, trust throughout an organization.

597
00:39:45.28 --> 00:39:49.28
What this has been people have the motivation to do the hard work behind the scenes which

598
00:39:49.28 --> 00:39:51.32
makes them great at what they do.

599
00:39:51.32 --> 00:39:55.32
These people have the drive to act in order to make themselves better and to avoid anything

600
00:39:55.32 --> 00:39:57.64
detrimental to achieving their goals.

601
00:39:57.64 --> 00:40:02.28
This work ethic generally has a way of making everyone around them better too.

602
00:40:02.28 --> 00:40:08.16
Self-disciplined leaders have a bias for action and in uncertain times, leaders to spell

603
00:40:08.16 --> 00:40:11.48
uncertainty through competent and confident actions.

604
00:40:11.48 --> 00:40:16.04
Self-disciplined leaders have an offensive mindset and do not allow setbacks or obstacles

605
00:40:16.04 --> 00:40:17.72
to stop progress.

606
00:40:17.72 --> 00:40:23.16
Good leaders find a way to win and inspire faith and belief throughout an organization.

607
00:40:23.16 --> 00:40:27.36
Some people are born with a greater propensity to be self-disciplined than others.

608
00:40:27.36 --> 00:40:30.80
Like other traits, self-disciplined can be developed.

609
00:40:30.80 --> 00:40:35.20
For those who have poor self-discipline, I have found the best way to improve self-discipline

610
00:40:35.20 --> 00:40:39.92
is to do some small things and work yourself into a more difficult things.

611
00:40:39.92 --> 00:40:44.12
If you hit a bump and backslide a bit, do not beat yourself up, just get back with the

612
00:40:44.12 --> 00:40:45.12
program.

613
00:40:45.12 --> 00:40:52.08
Remember, good habits are developed through self-discipline of continuing to do those things.

614
00:40:52.08 --> 00:40:57.20
I can ask this question a decent amount.

615
00:40:57.20 --> 00:41:03.04
Am I disciplined because I was in the Navy or am I disciplined because I am disciplined?

616
00:41:03.04 --> 00:41:06.12
And I don't know, what do you think?

617
00:41:06.12 --> 00:41:13.92
I think the training that you receive the Navy certainly helped is my belief.

618
00:41:13.92 --> 00:41:18.24
I think goals are important.

619
00:41:18.24 --> 00:41:25.32
If you have no goals in your life, nothing that's meaningful and purposeful for you to

620
00:41:25.32 --> 00:41:27.12
work toward.

621
00:41:27.12 --> 00:41:29.40
But the hell are you going to be disciplined about?

622
00:41:29.40 --> 00:41:34.28
You're going to be kind of like just drifting one way or another.

623
00:41:34.28 --> 00:41:41.56
I think people that have specific goals, you're goal to be a seal, you're goal, venture

624
00:41:41.56 --> 00:41:51.12
where a seal to be a seal commander, etc., etc., kind of sets you up to be more disciplined

625
00:41:51.12 --> 00:41:55.28
about achieving those goals.

626
00:41:55.28 --> 00:41:58.96
I think it's probably a little bit of both.

627
00:41:58.96 --> 00:42:05.96
But I do think the path you chose and those goals you had probably did a lot to help

628
00:42:05.96 --> 00:42:09.04
you become a very self-discipline person.

629
00:42:09.04 --> 00:42:11.28
Then you think that's the same for you then.

630
00:42:11.28 --> 00:42:13.28
Well, I do.

631
00:42:13.28 --> 00:42:21.24
I think if I didn't take the path I did by getting into an army, I probably wouldn't

632
00:42:21.24 --> 00:42:28.40
have had the benefit of those NCOs and other role models who showed me that in order

633
00:42:28.40 --> 00:42:31.24
to achieve something you really got to work hard for.

634
00:42:31.24 --> 00:42:37.48
Now, when I was growing up as a kid, my dad, my family tried to show me those things.

635
00:42:37.48 --> 00:42:47.28
So I think it's kind of I think building blocks along to Wayne your life.

636
00:42:47.28 --> 00:42:49.76
You're going to learn some of that from your family.

637
00:42:49.76 --> 00:42:51.88
Then I'm a big believer in sports.

638
00:42:51.88 --> 00:42:52.88
You play sports.

639
00:42:52.88 --> 00:42:55.08
I play sports in high school.

640
00:42:55.08 --> 00:42:59.56
You have to be disciplined in order to get out there on a field and not get yourself

641
00:42:59.56 --> 00:43:01.56
beat up.

642
00:43:01.56 --> 00:43:06.92
And then you join the military and again, you've got to show some discipline in order

643
00:43:06.92 --> 00:43:07.92
to...

644
00:43:07.92 --> 00:43:11.96
Because you know, people are counting on you in order to achieve what you want to

645
00:43:11.96 --> 00:43:12.96
in that regard.

646
00:43:12.96 --> 00:43:18.08
So I think it's really like building blocks as you go through your life.

647
00:43:18.08 --> 00:43:25.52
Some people are fortunate to have role models and mentors in their life who are going

648
00:43:25.52 --> 00:43:28.16
to show them why discipline is important.

649
00:43:28.16 --> 00:43:30.40
And then you just continue with it.

650
00:43:30.40 --> 00:43:31.80
Yeah, I think I was...

651
00:43:31.80 --> 00:43:33.68
I don't know if this is luck, you're unlucky.

652
00:43:33.68 --> 00:43:36.28
I was lucky in the fact that I wasn't really great at anything.

653
00:43:36.28 --> 00:43:40.92
When I had the single teams, if I didn't work hard, I was going to look like an idiot.

654
00:43:40.92 --> 00:43:42.36
And I didn't want to look like an idiot.

655
00:43:42.36 --> 00:43:44.56
And I didn't want to let my teammates down.

656
00:43:44.56 --> 00:43:48.56
So I had to just work hard to be ready for stuff.

657
00:43:48.56 --> 00:43:49.72
That's definitely the...

658
00:43:49.72 --> 00:43:52.32
That definitely influenced my path quite a bit.

659
00:43:52.32 --> 00:44:00.16
I think if I would have been a natural, a naturally gifted athlete, I would have had

660
00:44:00.16 --> 00:44:01.16
less discipline.

661
00:44:01.16 --> 00:44:03.48
I wouldn't need it as much discipline.

662
00:44:03.48 --> 00:44:06.56
But the other thing you had to remember is people get out of the sealed teams.

663
00:44:06.56 --> 00:44:10.20
And sometimes they're even still in the sealed teams and they let themselves go.

664
00:44:10.20 --> 00:44:13.20
They don't practice, they don't train, they get out of shape.

665
00:44:13.20 --> 00:44:14.20
Yeah.

666
00:44:14.20 --> 00:44:21.64
So just because you were in the military, just because you were in the sealed teams or whatever

667
00:44:21.64 --> 00:44:24.72
you did, and you got to maintain that discipline.

668
00:44:24.72 --> 00:44:29.48
That discipline is not a chip that they put into your brain and now you've got it.

669
00:44:29.48 --> 00:44:31.04
You don't have to worry about anymore.

670
00:44:31.04 --> 00:44:33.04
No, you still got to go.

671
00:44:33.04 --> 00:44:37.44
Yeah, you know, Jack, I do think that's why purpose is so important.

672
00:44:37.44 --> 00:44:40.88
And those goals are so important because the same at Ranger School.

673
00:44:40.88 --> 00:44:46.16
You get that Ranger tab and that's when the hard work should start because now you've

674
00:44:46.16 --> 00:44:51.40
got to prove it every day that I deserve to have this Ranger tab on my shoulder.

675
00:44:51.40 --> 00:44:57.44
And I see it, you know, folks I know that went the Ranger School and out there out of the

676
00:44:57.44 --> 00:45:00.36
military and they'd just let themselves go.

677
00:45:00.36 --> 00:45:06.000
And it's probably because they don't have that purpose anymore or that goal anymore.

678
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.36
And I think that's an unfortunate thing and that's why purpose is so important.

679
00:45:11.36 --> 00:45:17.48
That's why I think leaders have to be able to communicate purpose to their followers.

680
00:45:17.48 --> 00:45:19.36
So they're followers understand.

681
00:45:19.36 --> 00:45:22.92
And I know you talk about this in your, like, how do we have leadership book?

682
00:45:22.92 --> 00:45:28.08
You know, so people understand why am I doing this thing that the leader has told me to

683
00:45:28.08 --> 00:45:29.08
do?

684
00:45:29.08 --> 00:45:32.16
Well, if you don't explain the purpose, the leaders aren't, or the followers aren't going

685
00:45:32.16 --> 00:45:33.16
to get it.

686
00:45:33.16 --> 00:45:34.16
Yeah, 100%.

687
00:45:34.16 --> 00:45:35.16
Yeah.

688
00:45:35.16 --> 00:45:38.84
Um, fast forward a little bit, digging it in respect.

689
00:45:38.84 --> 00:45:42.52
Leaders demonstrate leaders demonstrate respect for others by the words they choose

690
00:45:42.52 --> 00:45:45.52
the tone of voice they use and by treating people with dignity.

691
00:45:45.52 --> 00:45:49.80
Demonstrating respect is also about being considered of a person's time and showing interest

692
00:45:49.80 --> 00:45:51.32
in what others think.

693
00:45:51.32 --> 00:45:54.36
Good leaders treat others respectfully regardless of position.

694
00:45:54.36 --> 00:45:58.64
Good leaders treat the maintenance person with the same amount of respect they treat the

695
00:45:58.64 --> 00:46:00.40
CEO.

696
00:46:00.40 --> 00:46:05.68
I believe it is impossible to be toxic leader to be autoxic leader if you treat those people

697
00:46:05.68 --> 00:46:07.76
you lead with dignity and respect.

698
00:46:07.76 --> 00:46:11.92
This does not mean you cannot hold people to the prescribed standard and counsel them.

699
00:46:11.92 --> 00:46:15.48
However, there is a dignified and respectful way to do those things.

700
00:46:15.48 --> 00:46:19.40
A leader could even fire someone in a dignified and respectful way.

701
00:46:19.40 --> 00:46:23.04
A rule to follow is praise and public, reprimand and private.

702
00:46:23.04 --> 00:46:28.44
Now, what's interesting about this paragraph is this is anybody that doesn't, that has

703
00:46:28.44 --> 00:46:30.68
sort of a surface view of the military.

704
00:46:30.68 --> 00:46:34.32
They don't think that this is applicable at all in the military.

705
00:46:34.32 --> 00:46:37.000
I guess it's just from boot camp movies, right?

706
00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.68
I guess it's just from full metal jacket.

707
00:46:39.68 --> 00:46:43.44
Full metal jacket has given and I love that movie.

708
00:46:43.44 --> 00:46:44.44
It's a great movie.

709
00:46:44.44 --> 00:46:47.04
It's incredible movie and it is accurate.

710
00:46:47.04 --> 00:46:51.20
You know, you talk to any marine look, they don't use the same language that they used

711
00:46:51.20 --> 00:46:52.20
back then.

712
00:46:52.20 --> 00:46:57.08
But man, boot camp is boot camp and it is yelling and screaming, making people uncomfortable

713
00:46:57.08 --> 00:47:03.76
and really not treating them with treating them with disrespect, especially in the beginning.

714
00:47:03.76 --> 00:47:09.88
So I think movies like that have given this false image of the military that that's

715
00:47:09.88 --> 00:47:14.04
how military leadership works and it is not true.

716
00:47:14.04 --> 00:47:16.000
Now are there leaders that act like that?

717
00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.76
Yeah, they're absolutely are in the military.

718
00:47:17.76 --> 00:47:18.76
And I guess what?

719
00:47:18.76 --> 00:47:22.000
There's leaders that act like that in the civilian sector too, that are disrespectful

720
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.64
that treat people bad.

721
00:47:23.64 --> 00:47:27.52
And leadership positions and it's not good.

722
00:47:27.52 --> 00:47:31.88
And what's interesting about this is I can yell and scream.

723
00:47:31.88 --> 00:47:35.72
If I if I'm your boss, I can yell at screaming you and you're probably going to do what

724
00:47:35.72 --> 00:47:36.72
I tell you.

725
00:47:36.72 --> 00:47:37.96
You're intimidated.

726
00:47:37.96 --> 00:47:39.64
You don't want to get fired.

727
00:47:39.64 --> 00:47:42.92
You don't want to hear me yell and scream.

728
00:47:42.92 --> 00:47:44.40
So you go do what I tell you to do.

729
00:47:44.40 --> 00:47:48.28
And so I get some positive feedback on my yelling and screaming.

730
00:47:48.28 --> 00:47:51.92
However, as soon as you get home, you're on monster.com looking for a new job because

731
00:47:51.92 --> 00:47:54.40
you don't want to be working with me because I'm a jerk.

732
00:47:54.40 --> 00:47:56.48
And by the way, how much effort do you actually give?

733
00:47:56.48 --> 00:47:58.48
Do you give 110%?

734
00:47:58.48 --> 00:48:04.16
No, you probably give 72%, which is the bare minimum you needed to give to get the job done.

735
00:48:04.16 --> 00:48:08.68
So all my yelling and screaming got me the bare minimum that you are going to produce.

736
00:48:08.68 --> 00:48:11.88
Whereas if I treated you with respect, you're going to have 110%.

737
00:48:11.88 --> 00:48:16.72
You're going to do that job better than I could do it and better than you could do it with

738
00:48:16.72 --> 00:48:17.96
your minimum effort.

739
00:48:17.96 --> 00:48:24.32
So this idea, treating people with respect, I mean, this is just, it seems like common sense.

740
00:48:24.32 --> 00:48:28.08
And I think sometimes, I mean, I had this happen when I started working with companies.

741
00:48:28.08 --> 00:48:30.20
The very, actually it wasn't the very first.

742
00:48:30.20 --> 00:48:32.36
It was one of the first companies I started working with.

743
00:48:32.36 --> 00:48:36.08
And I'm on the phone with the CEO doing an introductory call.

744
00:48:36.08 --> 00:48:40.20
And he says, I can't wait to get out here and whip my people into shape.

745
00:48:40.20 --> 00:48:43.32
And I said, hey, you know, something, if you want something to whip your people into shape,

746
00:48:43.32 --> 00:48:45.56
you should get someone else.

747
00:48:45.56 --> 00:48:48.88
Because whipping people is what happened, that's what you do to slaves.

748
00:48:48.88 --> 00:48:50.96
And slaves is not a good environment.

749
00:48:50.96 --> 00:48:52.44
And no one wants to be a slave.

750
00:48:52.44 --> 00:48:54.80
And they don't do the job that they're supposed to do.

751
00:48:54.80 --> 00:48:59.08
They'll do the bare minimum so they don't get a punished for it.

752
00:48:59.08 --> 00:49:01.08
So I'm glad you got this section in here.

753
00:49:01.08 --> 00:49:06.68
Yeah, you know, Jack, I have, you know, business owners talking to me about that all the time.

754
00:49:06.68 --> 00:49:08.84
You know, like, why can't I be a toxic leader?

755
00:49:08.84 --> 00:49:14.16
You know, I get, get the job done, you know, get shit done, you know, that type of thing.

756
00:49:14.16 --> 00:49:17.24
And that's kind of like, you know what, you could be a toxic leader.

757
00:49:17.24 --> 00:49:20.48
And like you said, you could yell and scream and people are going to listen to you.

758
00:49:20.48 --> 00:49:22.08
And they're going to do it.

759
00:49:22.08 --> 00:49:28.84
But if you're looking for a sustained success over the long period of time, that's where,

760
00:49:28.84 --> 00:49:31.56
you know, toxic leadership does not work.

761
00:49:31.56 --> 00:49:35.04
Because toxic leadership could work for short-term gain.

762
00:49:35.04 --> 00:49:40.52
But if you want sustained success over time, that's not the way to do it.

763
00:49:40.52 --> 00:49:42.64
Certainly is not.

764
00:49:42.64 --> 00:49:46.96
Fast forward a little bit here.

765
00:49:46.96 --> 00:49:51.12
And again, if you're listening to me read this, I'm just jumping through various sections.

766
00:49:51.12 --> 00:49:53.92
It's not going to sound completely cohesive as I read it.

767
00:49:53.92 --> 00:49:56.92
But you get the book and it is completely cohesive.

768
00:49:56.92 --> 00:50:00.52
Next section I want to read here is to be successful in life, you must make yourself

769
00:50:00.52 --> 00:50:01.52
vulnerable.

770
00:50:01.52 --> 00:50:02.84
There's no risk without reward.

771
00:50:02.84 --> 00:50:06.76
With that said, the risk you take must be prudent and must include risk analysis and

772
00:50:06.76 --> 00:50:08.40
risk mitigation measures.

773
00:50:08.40 --> 00:50:11.76
Nothing is risk free and seldom can a person eliminate risk entirely.

774
00:50:11.76 --> 00:50:18.000
Although risk cannot be eliminated, leaders must identify ways to reduce the most probable

775
00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.08
and highest impact risks.

776
00:50:22.08 --> 00:50:26.36
I think this is funny because I say to leaders all the time, if there's no risk, it's

777
00:50:26.36 --> 00:50:27.36
not even a decision.

778
00:50:27.36 --> 00:50:28.36
What's the decision?

779
00:50:28.36 --> 00:50:31.16
If there's no risk and it's just a benefit, we're doing it.

780
00:50:31.16 --> 00:50:32.60
We're not even talking about that's not a decision.

781
00:50:32.60 --> 00:50:34.80
That's just what we're doing.

782
00:50:34.80 --> 00:50:38.12
Yeah, absolutely.

783
00:50:38.12 --> 00:50:43.80
And I think that's why some leaders fail to have the courage to make decisions because

784
00:50:43.80 --> 00:50:50.80
with almost any decision you're making, there's some sort of risk associated with that.

785
00:50:50.80 --> 00:51:01.24
And again, if you're going to look at gaining anything for your organization, we talked

786
00:51:01.24 --> 00:51:05.08
about moving yourself out of your comfort zone, you've got to move your organization

787
00:51:05.08 --> 00:51:08.04
out of its comfort zone too.

788
00:51:08.04 --> 00:51:14.32
And so it's about, okay, understanding what those risks are and then how am I going to

789
00:51:14.32 --> 00:51:20.08
reduce the probability of this happening and also reduce the impact of it happening.

790
00:51:20.08 --> 00:51:24.96
And those are certain steps you could take.

791
00:51:24.96 --> 00:51:33.08
I talked about optimism a lot and especially if you hit a really bad day, a really bad

792
00:51:33.08 --> 00:51:36.08
day.

793
00:51:36.08 --> 00:51:41.24
You have to be optimistic and then lead your organization through that.

794
00:51:41.24 --> 00:51:46.60
But it's not just because you're telling people, hey, things are going to get better.

795
00:51:46.60 --> 00:51:52.32
You've actually got to put a plan together that's believable to your followers.

796
00:51:52.32 --> 00:51:58.68
So it's just not about, you know, what you say, it's about, okay, what plan have we put

797
00:51:58.68 --> 00:52:03.68
together now that's going to show that we're going to be able to do things a little bit

798
00:52:03.68 --> 00:52:05.96
differently to overcome this adversity.

799
00:52:05.96 --> 00:52:12.08
So that's really, and it takes a lot of hard work and it doesn't come easy.

800
00:52:12.08 --> 00:52:16.04
Yeah, I was, when I talk about you got to believe in the mission, right?

801
00:52:16.04 --> 00:52:22.04
And I say, believe isn't doesn't mean the old say, if you can believe it, you can

802
00:52:22.04 --> 00:52:23.04
achieve it.

803
00:52:23.04 --> 00:52:24.04
Actually not true.

804
00:52:24.04 --> 00:52:27.36
Because I could say, I believe I can find it's not I'm not going to be able to fly to

805
00:52:27.36 --> 00:52:32.56
me believe belief in the mission means you see an actual pathway to achieve the mission.

806
00:52:32.56 --> 00:52:35.60
And I might be challenging and there's going to be bumps in hurdles and obstacles along the

807
00:52:35.60 --> 00:52:39.28
way, but we are going to be able to do it and hey, everyone, here's how we're going to get

808
00:52:39.28 --> 00:52:40.28
there.

809
00:52:40.28 --> 00:52:44.72
And as long as you can show people an actual pathway to get to this victory, then

810
00:52:44.72 --> 00:52:47.56
you can then people can believe in what you're doing for sure.

811
00:52:47.56 --> 00:52:48.56
Yeah.

812
00:52:48.56 --> 00:52:49.56
Yeah.

813
00:52:49.56 --> 00:52:53.72
And, you know, I'll just reflect back on a bad day.

814
00:52:53.72 --> 00:53:00.20
You know, I had January 5th, 2006, I think you're familiar with the glass factory bombing

815
00:53:00.20 --> 00:53:02.80
there and in Ramadi.

816
00:53:02.80 --> 00:53:13.28
And you know, you have a bad day like that and you just, you know, as a leader, you just can't

817
00:53:13.28 --> 00:53:14.96
cave in because it's so.

818
00:53:14.96 --> 00:53:16.28
So give everyone a little brief.

819
00:53:16.28 --> 00:53:18.20
I mean, obviously, I knew about it.

820
00:53:18.20 --> 00:53:20.80
I arrived there shortly thereafter and I tracked it as it happened.

821
00:53:20.80 --> 00:53:25.28
I mean, it was a horrific incident at a police recruiting event.

822
00:53:25.28 --> 00:53:32.44
So recruiting local police in the city of Ramadi to come and join the Iraqi police and

823
00:53:32.44 --> 00:53:37.40
become the defenders of the city and help the local populist.

824
00:53:37.40 --> 00:53:39.24
What we talked about earlier, defend the populist here.

825
00:53:39.24 --> 00:53:44.24
You go, come and sign up and it was actually going pretty well.

826
00:53:44.24 --> 00:53:45.24
And then this event happened.

827
00:53:45.24 --> 00:53:46.84
Yeah, it was going remarkably well.

828
00:53:46.84 --> 00:53:54.76
You know, when we first got there, I guess, was Jaloon or Jalai of 2005, mixed June and

829
00:53:54.76 --> 00:53:55.76
July, I'm there.

830
00:53:55.76 --> 00:54:04.76
Of course, but Jalai of 2005, you know, we started police recruiting events and we'd

831
00:54:04.76 --> 00:54:09.32
have like two or three people show up to join the police.

832
00:54:09.32 --> 00:54:11.44
I mean, it was pathetic.

833
00:54:11.44 --> 00:54:17.54
And you know, we started to talk to the shakes and actually through our talks with the

834
00:54:17.54 --> 00:54:24.64
shakes, they would tell us some things that our troops were doing that probably weren't

835
00:54:24.64 --> 00:54:28.48
that beneficial to the citizens of Ramadi.

836
00:54:28.48 --> 00:54:32.48
So we started to change up some of our tactics and procedures.

837
00:54:32.48 --> 00:54:37.92
That didn't affect our operation, but it helped the shakes understand that, hey, we were

838
00:54:37.92 --> 00:54:41.96
really here for your people, for your tribe.

839
00:54:41.96 --> 00:54:49.08
And this really demonstrated self in January of 2006.

840
00:54:49.08 --> 00:54:56.08
We held this recruiting event.

841
00:54:56.08 --> 00:55:02.64
And on January 3rd, we had 200 people show up at the glass factory in Ramadi where we're

842
00:55:02.64 --> 00:55:03.96
conducting this event.

843
00:55:03.96 --> 00:55:07.68
And the glass factory is an old factory, but it's a nice big building and it was right

844
00:55:07.68 --> 00:55:13.08
outside or very close to the main US camp of camp or Maddie.

845
00:55:13.08 --> 00:55:14.20
So it was a pretty good spot to do.

846
00:55:14.20 --> 00:55:15.20
Exactly.

847
00:55:15.20 --> 00:55:17.000
It was a good spot to do it.

848
00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000
200 people showed up the first day.

849
00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.60
It's like we can't believe this.

850
00:55:20.60 --> 00:55:23.12
Like before we were having two or three people show up.

851
00:55:23.12 --> 00:55:26.000
We got 200 people standing in line to join the police.

852
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.40
So the shake, you know, that told us the shakes were getting the word out to other tribes,

853
00:55:29.40 --> 00:55:30.40
people to hate.

854
00:55:30.40 --> 00:55:33.000
Come in, we trust these Americans.

855
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Come in.

856
00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.56
And so the second day, we had around 450, 500 people standing in line to join the police.

857
00:55:39.56 --> 00:55:42.08
It's like this is incredible.

858
00:55:42.08 --> 00:55:47.12
The third day is I reflect back on it.

859
00:55:47.12 --> 00:55:51.48
Whenever you're operating in an uncertainty environment, you don't want to do things three

860
00:55:51.48 --> 00:55:52.48
days in a row.

861
00:55:52.48 --> 00:55:55.16
So it was a big mistake I made.

862
00:55:55.16 --> 00:55:58.72
Third day, we had about 800 people standing in line.

863
00:55:58.72 --> 00:56:00.12
I mean, we were ecstatic.

864
00:56:00.12 --> 00:56:03.40
We thought we really turned a corner here.

865
00:56:03.40 --> 00:56:07.84
And a suicide bomber because this was a third day in a row we were doing.

866
00:56:07.84 --> 00:56:13.52
A suicide bomber shows up and detonates their vest right in the middle of this large

867
00:56:13.52 --> 00:56:22.04
crowd, killing over 100 Iraqis and killed a Marine dog handler, a sergeant con and also

868
00:56:22.04 --> 00:56:27.24
a good friend of mine, Lieutenant Colonel Mike McLaughlin, and injured several other

869
00:56:27.24 --> 00:56:28.80
of our soldiers.

870
00:56:28.80 --> 00:56:32.52
Some severely but thank God no one else died.

871
00:56:32.52 --> 00:56:36.48
No other US military died from that attack.

872
00:56:36.48 --> 00:56:42.56
And so that was a really, really bad day.

873
00:56:42.56 --> 00:56:50.40
The way I handled it is I brought the leaders together the following day because two weeks

874
00:56:50.40 --> 00:56:56.44
from that particular day, we were going to have 200 Iraqis show up at the glass factory

875
00:56:56.44 --> 00:57:01.08
again so we could ship them the bag dead to attend police training.

876
00:57:01.08 --> 00:57:03.40
So we knew where we were going to have a similar situation.

877
00:57:03.40 --> 00:57:09.20
So got everybody together next day and the importance of leaders admitting when they do

878
00:57:09.20 --> 00:57:13.92
something wrong I think really comes out here because when I got everybody together I

879
00:57:13.92 --> 00:57:15.16
don't know what they were thinking.

880
00:57:15.16 --> 00:57:18.64
Maybe they were thinking I was going to try to blame somebody I don't know but the first

881
00:57:18.64 --> 00:57:25.16
thing I said was we're not going to waste time fixing blame on anybody because I'm the

882
00:57:25.16 --> 00:57:27.000
one responsible for this.

883
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.16
So forget about fixing blame.

884
00:57:29.16 --> 00:57:34.92
But it's on me what we need to spend our time doing is talk about how are we going to change

885
00:57:34.92 --> 00:57:40.16
things so this doesn't happen two weeks from now when we do the same event again.

886
00:57:40.16 --> 00:57:45.04
Because we had to publicize this so people knew to show up so it's not like you're

887
00:57:45.04 --> 00:57:47.16
keeping it from the insurgents.

888
00:57:47.16 --> 00:57:51.08
And so I'm not going to get into the details of how we change things but we change things

889
00:57:51.08 --> 00:57:56.52
significantly in terms of the way the outside of that glass factory was set up.

890
00:57:56.52 --> 00:58:01.96
So if God forbid a suicide bomber was going to blow themselves up again the most they could

891
00:58:01.96 --> 00:58:06.76
take out would be about 10 people rather than 100 or more.

892
00:58:06.76 --> 00:58:18.28
And so the point is when leaders hit these bad days this adversity there's the organization

893
00:58:18.28 --> 00:58:22.40
is counting on you to find a way through it.

894
00:58:22.40 --> 00:58:29.84
And that was a lesson I learned. I mentioned this book is filled with mistakes.

895
00:58:29.84 --> 00:58:34.36
I made that I was able to learn from and by putting this book out hopefully others won't

896
00:58:34.36 --> 00:58:39.32
have to make similar mistakes.

897
00:58:39.32 --> 00:58:49.32
So the whole point of what I just said is when you hit adversity you've got to be able

898
00:58:49.32 --> 00:58:53.88
to be resilient enough to fight your way through that for the organization.

899
00:58:53.88 --> 00:58:57.72
And again that's not going to come by itself.

900
00:58:57.72 --> 00:59:03.72
You've got to prepare and develop your resiliency before these bad days happen because

901
00:59:03.72 --> 00:59:05.84
we all know they're going to happen.

902
00:59:05.84 --> 00:59:12.16
And then it's also the important part of a leader admitting they made a mistake.

903
00:59:12.16 --> 00:59:17.56
So the organization doesn't have to start pointing fingers at one another because if you

904
00:59:17.56 --> 00:59:23.24
don't do that and you can't develop that sense of trust because people know when you're

905
00:59:23.24 --> 00:59:25.28
screwed up.

906
00:59:25.28 --> 00:59:32.32
And if people are expecting more energy on watching their own back they're not going

907
00:59:32.32 --> 00:59:39.24
to be expanding energy on getting done with the organization needs to get done because

908
00:59:39.24 --> 00:59:42.96
watching your own back takes a hell of a lot of energy doesn't it?

909
00:59:42.96 --> 00:59:46.56
And so that's really the moral of the story.

910
00:59:46.56 --> 00:59:52.68
And you were there when we had a blue on blue that I wrote about an extreme ownership

911
00:59:52.68 --> 00:59:59.28
and it's the same exact approach I took which was hey there's a friendly Iraqi soldier

912
00:59:59.28 --> 01:00:04.44
dead there's several Iraqis wounded one of my guys is wounded who we're going to blame.

913
01:00:04.44 --> 01:00:07.88
Don't look any further than me because this is on me and it is on me.

914
01:00:07.88 --> 01:00:08.88
This is happening.

915
01:00:08.88 --> 01:00:09.88
I'm the senior guy on the battlefield.

916
01:00:09.88 --> 01:00:11.56
This is 100% my fault.

917
01:00:11.56 --> 01:00:15.60
And that way yeah we don't have to look at who are going to point fingers at no one has to

918
01:00:15.60 --> 01:00:18.72
worry about hey I'm going to leave you out the dry I'm not going to hang you out to dry.

919
01:00:18.72 --> 01:00:23.16
This is 100% on me and then we how do we prevent this from ever happening again.

920
01:00:23.16 --> 01:00:25.96
So the thing a leader has to do in those situations.

921
01:00:25.96 --> 01:00:29.60
Yeah absolutely.

922
01:00:29.60 --> 01:00:34.12
Fast forward a little bit here you talk about creating a vision you say the concept

923
01:00:34.12 --> 01:00:39.84
of a leader providing a vision to an organization they lead is at least 2000 years old

924
01:00:39.84 --> 01:00:46.04
in the king's James version of the Bible Proverbs 29 18 reads where there is no vision

925
01:00:46.04 --> 01:00:49.28
the people perish.

926
01:00:49.28 --> 01:00:52.72
And early point my experience leading people I became aware that providing a vision of

927
01:00:52.72 --> 01:00:55.48
the future was one of the most important things a leader can do.

928
01:00:55.48 --> 01:00:59.68
The whole concept of leadership is about taking people to a place where they could not reach

929
01:00:59.68 --> 01:01:00.84
on their own.

930
01:01:00.84 --> 01:01:04.64
I have found that when I provide a vision of the future to a group I lead it motivates

931
01:01:04.64 --> 01:01:08.48
and inspires them to work toward achieving a desired end state.

932
01:01:08.48 --> 01:01:13.84
And as well I believe creating a shared vision and communicating it consistently are important

933
01:01:13.84 --> 01:01:15.96
roles of a leader.

934
01:01:15.96 --> 01:01:21.000
Visualizing achievement is essential if you are to gain success.

935
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:25.32
A vision must be a simple unique ideal image of the future.

936
01:01:25.32 --> 01:01:29.80
Ideally the vision a leader develop should be a shared vision.

937
01:01:29.80 --> 01:01:35.000
A shared vision not only does not only mean every in the organization believes in the vision

938
01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:41.40
but also that representative members of the organization have provided input to create the

939
01:01:41.40 --> 01:01:41.40
vision.

940
01:01:41.40 --> 01:01:49.64
Occasionally I will get I talk about decentralized command all the time with all the companies

941
01:01:49.64 --> 01:01:56.000
I work with and occasionally I will get someone saying hey you know I feel like the team

942
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.64
doesn't really know where we are going and I am trying to lead them in the right direction

943
01:01:58.64 --> 01:02:04.96
but I don't want to impose it on them and I say listen it is okay for a leader

944
01:02:04.96 --> 01:02:09.64
sometimes say hey everyone this is where we are going because not everyone has the visibility

945
01:02:09.64 --> 01:02:14.04
that you have from your leadership perspective you know if you are in charge of a project

946
01:02:14.04 --> 01:02:18.56
not everyone can see all the moving pieces so they might not see hey this is where we

947
01:02:18.56 --> 01:02:20.88
need to go this is what we are doing.

948
01:02:20.88 --> 01:02:26.96
Is it good to get input for that collective vision absolutely but you may be in a situation

949
01:02:26.96 --> 01:02:30.88
where other members of the team don't have the vision that you have because just because

950
01:02:30.88 --> 01:02:34.80
of where you are sitting or where you are standing you can see a little bit more you have

951
01:02:34.80 --> 01:02:37.96
a little bit more visibility on things so sometimes you do have to make the vision and

952
01:02:37.96 --> 01:02:42.64
as soon as you make that vision your vision doesn't isn't written in stone or you shouldn't

953
01:02:42.64 --> 01:02:45.44
write your vision in stone if you write your vision in stone you are probably making a

954
01:02:45.44 --> 01:02:49.72
mistake and some people might think that that sounds weak well you are going to change

955
01:02:49.72 --> 01:02:53.72
your vision actually I may change the vision if we get to a point where we need something

956
01:02:53.72 --> 01:02:56.48
just like when you are in a body say hey wait a second we have been doing things like

957
01:02:56.48 --> 01:02:59.92
this we are not getting any progress with the shakes the shakes your tone is oh

958
01:02:59.92 --> 01:03:03.20
guess what we are going to do a just our vision so there is nothing wrong with a

959
01:03:03.20 --> 01:03:06.64
just new vision and there is nothing wrong with if you are not getting feedback it is

960
01:03:06.64 --> 01:03:10.08
okay cool watch this here is the vision here is what we are going to do start moving

961
01:03:10.08 --> 01:03:17.92
that direction adapt as needed yeah you know totally agree one one thing I learned when

962
01:03:17.92 --> 01:03:27.44
got this is back around late 90s around the year 2000 was before 9-11 when I took

963
01:03:27.44 --> 01:03:32.64
man to 55th brigade you know national guard brigade so you know about 3000

964
01:03:32.64 --> 01:03:38.24
soldiers distributed across northeastern Pennsylvania down toward the Philadelphia area and

965
01:03:38.24 --> 01:03:44.40
you know 85% of them had full times of laying jobs so like man I got a

966
01:03:44.40 --> 01:03:49.44
develop a vision for this organization in order for us to show some you know to move

967
01:03:49.44 --> 01:03:55.32
forward here and what I did is I went around to representative

968
01:03:55.32 --> 01:04:01.16
sampling of soldiers who were part of that brigade I would talk to a PFC

969
01:04:01.16 --> 01:04:05.80
that had like a year in Norm you know I would talk to a major who had may or may be

970
01:04:05.80 --> 01:04:11.28
16-17 years in the army and every and a few folks in between there I mean

971
01:04:11.28 --> 01:04:14.84
3000 soldiers can't talk to all of them and say hey where do you want to see

972
01:04:14.84 --> 01:04:19.56
this brigade go and the question I would ask them I would say hey you know if you

973
01:04:19.56 --> 01:04:23.16
fell asleep for five years and woke up five years from now what would you want to see

974
01:04:23.16 --> 01:04:29.08
this brigade look like then you know and the funny thing is whether it was a soldier

975
01:04:29.08 --> 01:04:34.84
low rank one year experience or higher ranking officer with 17 years experience

976
01:04:34.84 --> 01:04:39.32
everybody kind of wanted the same thing they wanted to be well trained so if we

977
01:04:39.32 --> 01:04:43.44
had a deploy we'd be able to do our jobs successfully and that ended up

978
01:04:43.44 --> 01:04:48.56
essentially what what what the vision was so what it taught me and this goes for any

979
01:04:48.56 --> 01:04:52.84
business leader out there trying to develop a vision for their organization and

980
01:04:52.84 --> 01:04:56.92
many organizations are working distributed now you know with the pandemic and

981
01:04:56.92 --> 01:05:01.04
everything else it's try to get you know when I say shared vision try to get a

982
01:05:01.04 --> 01:05:04.68
representative sample if you could of where people would like to see it go

983
01:05:04.68 --> 01:05:08.92
and ultimately use the leader like you said you you've got a broader view of

984
01:05:08.92 --> 01:05:12.84
everything so yeah it's you finally got to put a stake in the ground say yeah

985
01:05:12.84 --> 01:05:16.000
this is going to be our vision but I think it's good I need to get a representative

986
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.32
samples sampling of those in your organization and and then you know when you

987
01:05:23.32 --> 01:05:27.84
get it out there you know you've got to you've got to share it in a an

988
01:05:27.84 --> 01:05:32.44
multitude of ways you know when you're speaking to people one-on-one you've got

989
01:05:32.44 --> 01:05:36.28
a communicate that vision you're speaking to a group of 500 you've got to

990
01:05:36.28 --> 01:05:41.20
communicate the vision through email through your website through whatever you

991
01:05:41.20 --> 01:05:46.36
know social media means you might want to use but the vision then has to be

992
01:05:46.36 --> 01:05:51.64
consistent you know can't be a new flavor of the month or a new vision of

993
01:05:51.64 --> 01:05:55.92
the quarter you know like you said visions could change but it shouldn't be

994
01:05:55.92 --> 01:06:00.52
changing on a very very frequent basis that's what I learned about developing a

995
01:06:00.52 --> 01:06:04.68
vision you know over 20 years ago yeah and it's it's always interesting like

996
01:06:04.68 --> 01:06:09.24
that's alignment right no matter who you talk to you talk to a frontline

997
01:06:09.24 --> 01:06:12.28
individual that's been in the army for six months you talk to someone that's

998
01:06:12.28 --> 01:06:16.12
been in the army for 20 years in listed officer on both ends of that

999
01:06:16.12 --> 01:06:20.44
spectrum and they all say oh well I'd like that if we get deployed we're ready to

1000
01:06:20.44 --> 01:06:25.40
do our job that you can make so many decisions based on that just knowing

1001
01:06:25.40 --> 01:06:29.52
that right there hey is it going to help us do our job if we spend time you know

1002
01:06:29.52 --> 01:06:33.36
clowning around at work on our drill weekend is it going to help us be ready to

1003
01:06:33.36 --> 01:06:36.64
do our job no it's not so let's do something else and that goes up and now

1004
01:06:36.64 --> 01:06:40.96
the chain of command and now that we have that shared aligned vision now we can

1005
01:06:40.96 --> 01:06:44.16
all make a bunch of decisions just based on the fact that we know that when

1006
01:06:44.16 --> 01:06:48.36
we deploy we want to be ready to do our job we want to be effective okay does

1007
01:06:48.36 --> 01:06:52.84
this help us be effective or not and we can make a decision so that's important

1008
01:06:52.84 --> 01:06:57.32
stuff fast forward a little bit you know let's get a chapter in here called

1009
01:06:57.32 --> 01:07:01.76
keeping your feet on the ground which is about humility you say I worked for an

1010
01:07:01.76 --> 01:07:06.76
arrogant leader before it was not any fun all of us who work for this man felt

1011
01:07:06.76 --> 01:07:10.36
our opinions were not valued he was the kind of guy who said things like when

1012
01:07:10.36 --> 01:07:16.76
I want your opinion I'll tell you what it is stereotypical military but not

1013
01:07:16.76 --> 01:07:20.84
actual military we believe we were not respected and we felt more like objects

1014
01:07:20.84 --> 01:07:25.60
rather than we were part of the team the results are initiative imagination and

1015
01:07:25.60 --> 01:07:30.60
creativity were stifled as you could imagine the leader failed again this is a

1016
01:07:30.60 --> 01:07:37.04
this is one of those false images of military leadership does it happen yes it

1017
01:07:37.04 --> 01:07:41.64
does happen and here's something else let's say about this you want to know

1018
01:07:41.64 --> 01:07:45.84
what it does happen more often in the military and one of the reason it happens

1019
01:07:45.84 --> 01:07:49.12
more often in the military is because in the military you're only in command

1020
01:07:49.12 --> 01:07:54.12
for two years generally speaking so most of the enlisted guys you work in

1021
01:07:54.12 --> 01:07:58.40
for a jerk or an arrogant person it takes them three months or three to six

1022
01:07:58.40 --> 01:08:01.96
months ago hey this guy really is arrogant then at six months are like oh

1023
01:08:01.96 --> 01:08:05.08
god what are we going to do about it this guy is horrible now to year now

1024
01:08:05.08 --> 01:08:07.56
they start thinking hey we should really do something about this we should get

1025
01:08:07.56 --> 01:08:10.000
rid of this guy we should run an opportunity command we should fill out our

1026
01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.04
surveys our command climate surveys and report what a jerk this guy is and then

1027
01:08:14.04 --> 01:08:16.28
it's eighteen months and then they go you know he's gonna be gone at six

1028
01:08:16.28 --> 01:08:20.000
months let's just freaking deal with it and that guy never gets the feedback and

1029
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.28
so everything that he did worked and it's positive feedback and it's a positive

1030
01:08:25.28 --> 01:08:28.40
feedback loop he thinks he did a good job because he yelled and screamed and didn't

1031
01:08:28.40 --> 01:08:32.20
take anyone's opinion and now he gets promoted that's the unfortunate reality

1032
01:08:32.20 --> 01:08:35.84
of the military yeah and the other interesting thing with that you know we could

1033
01:08:35.84 --> 01:08:42.36
call that guy a toxic leader is I found that toxic leaders are very good at

1034
01:08:42.36 --> 01:08:47.20
not letting their people they work for their superior officers but if you want to

1035
01:08:47.20 --> 01:08:52.28
call it see their toxicity oh for sure they're able to hide it I've known a lot of

1036
01:08:52.28 --> 01:08:57.16
military leaders that everyone above them in the chain of command loved them

1037
01:08:57.16 --> 01:09:01.52
everybody below the chain of command hated them yeah because above the chain of

1038
01:09:01.52 --> 01:09:04.44
command they see when someone does make-in stuff happen right below the chain of

1039
01:09:04.44 --> 01:09:08.56
command they're getting they're the ones that are freaking being driven to you

1040
01:09:08.56 --> 01:09:12.52
know bloody fingers as they try and get the job done and yeah that that

1041
01:09:12.52 --> 01:09:17.72
happens often yeah it's amazing how good they are at hiding that toxicity when

1042
01:09:17.72 --> 01:09:20.84
they're talking to somebody who who they work for yeah and you got to be

1043
01:09:20.84 --> 01:09:24.32
careful as a leader to make sure that that's not happening that's why it's

1044
01:09:24.32 --> 01:09:29.16
important like you said to go down and talk to the troops yeah and say hey

1045
01:09:29.16 --> 01:09:32.56
what's that goes Charles like as a leader how's that going and you know what

1046
01:09:32.56 --> 01:09:35.88
they're gonna say at first they say he's great but you got to ask them well

1047
01:09:35.88 --> 01:09:38.68
how often does he talk to do you take your you got to dig it out of them

1048
01:09:38.68 --> 01:09:42.000
because most of them they don't want to they don't want to make they don't want

1049
01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:48.36
that beef as echo would say yeah you know the the more you get down there

1050
01:09:48.36 --> 01:09:51.36
you know I call it muddy muddy boots leadership they're more to get down there

1051
01:09:51.36 --> 01:09:56.40
talk to the troops you know whether it be militarious civilian then you're

1052
01:09:56.40 --> 01:09:59.24
able to develop that trust too because you're right the first time you go

1053
01:09:59.24 --> 01:10:02.36
down and ask somebody hey how's it going they're not going to be totally honest

1054
01:10:02.36 --> 01:10:06.76
with you if they don't know you but the more they get used to seeing you come

1055
01:10:06.76 --> 01:10:11.16
around and and just having a rapport and see that you're hey normal guy and you

1056
01:10:11.16 --> 01:10:14.52
really do want the best for the organization they're going to loosen up until

1057
01:10:14.52 --> 01:10:18.76
later truth also don't burn your sources you know don't don't go back and

1058
01:10:18.76 --> 01:10:24.12
say hey echo I need to talk to you John Gronsky said you were a tyrant and

1059
01:10:24.12 --> 01:10:28.60
all that's not you're never going to get any information again no so you have

1060
01:10:28.60 --> 01:10:32.36
to be careful about that one fast forward a little bit one of the best ways

1061
01:10:32.36 --> 01:10:35.32
a leader could show respect to others is by asking for their opinion and

1062
01:10:35.32 --> 01:10:39.08
then seriously considering it leaders and powers others in an organization

1063
01:10:39.08 --> 01:10:43.80
simply by listening to state level headed and keep ones feet placed firmly on

1064
01:10:43.80 --> 01:10:46.92
the ground leaders must acknowledge others for their contributions to this

1065
01:10:46.92 --> 01:10:52.52
teams success so this is something I I've written about talking about

1066
01:10:53.48 --> 01:10:58.52
listening is I think is the most underrated possibly the most underrated

1067
01:10:58.52 --> 01:11:03.56
aspect of leadership the only other one that's in a close second and it correlates

1068
01:11:03.56 --> 01:11:07.72
very directly is asking earnest questions ask earnest questions and then

1069
01:11:07.72 --> 01:11:13.56
listen to what people have to say and you know some leaders think

1070
01:11:13.56 --> 01:11:18.28
they're listening but their actions don't show that they're listening you know like

1071
01:11:18.28 --> 01:11:22.12
you're going to talk to somebody hey could I have a minute could I talk to you

1072
01:11:22.12 --> 01:11:26.60
and you know leader is you know checking their phone while you're talking to them

1073
01:11:26.60 --> 01:11:30.04
or they're you know tapping something on the keyboard or they're their computer while

1074
01:11:30.04 --> 01:11:33.96
you're talking to them or you're talking to them they're looking off at somebody else you

1075
01:11:33.96 --> 01:11:37.08
know it's kind of like wow is this guy really listening to me you know that

1076
01:11:37.08 --> 01:11:39.96
leader might think they're listening but their actions are showing that they're not

1077
01:11:39.96 --> 01:11:44.60
really listening so it's it's important that you you really do that act of listening

1078
01:11:44.60 --> 01:11:50.68
actually listen yeah yeah fast forward a little bit identify your core values

1079
01:11:50.68 --> 01:11:54.44
to develop strong character you must take the time to figure out what you stand for

1080
01:11:54.44 --> 01:11:58.36
and what your core values really are this came to light for me many years ago

1081
01:11:58.36 --> 01:12:02.04
I attended a dinner at which the speaker gave an impassion talk about his own personal

1082
01:12:02.04 --> 01:12:05.88
core values the next day as I was still thinking about what I heard I realized if someone

1083
01:12:05.88 --> 01:12:10.92
asked me what my personal core values were I would not be able to give an answer

1084
01:12:10.92 --> 01:12:16.92
sure I had values I tried to be an ethical person but to that point I never took the time

1085
01:12:16.92 --> 01:12:21.16
to think long and hard about exactly what I stood for and my principles I never took the

1086
01:12:21.16 --> 01:12:28.52
time to consider what values were most important to me important you know

1087
01:12:28.52 --> 01:12:34.52
the other thing about values if if you don't understand what your own personal core

1088
01:12:34.52 --> 01:12:40.52
values are when you make personal decisions or when it comes a time for you to make a personal

1089
01:12:40.52 --> 01:12:48.12
decision about something I really believe you have to factor your your personal core

1090
01:12:48.12 --> 01:12:54.20
values into decisions you make so if you don't have those core values articulated in your

1091
01:12:54.20 --> 01:12:59.000
own mind how are you going to factor them in your decision and the same with organizations

1092
01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:05.88
you know organizations many organizations have organizational values but when the leadership team

1093
01:13:05.88 --> 01:13:10.44
gets together with the CEO and they're in the you know they're going through this decision

1094
01:13:10.44 --> 01:13:17.32
making process how many of them actually factor the organizational values into the decision that

1095
01:13:17.32 --> 01:13:25.64
they're making which I I would think I would just guess many don't even think about their values

1096
01:13:25.64 --> 01:13:30.68
when they're making a business decision which is crazy to think about yeah if you're making decisions

1097
01:13:30.68 --> 01:13:35.48
that you might as well just be making decisions in the blind exactly and then and then you're

1098
01:13:35.48 --> 01:13:39.72
not being true to your values and again that breaks trust with your customers or that breaks

1099
01:13:39.72 --> 01:13:45.80
trust with your employees or whom ever that particular decision is going to affect so yeah really

1100
01:13:46.52 --> 01:13:52.68
that's why values are so important I believe and then the other thing behaviors I think are

1101
01:13:52.68 --> 01:13:57.64
important too you know I I know a lot of organizations are getting you know they do have

1102
01:13:57.64 --> 01:14:03.000
organizational values but now they're also getting into organizational behaviors so they actually

1103
01:14:03.56 --> 01:14:10.36
list out you know maybe between 10 to 20 behaviors that they expect from their employees which I think

1104
01:14:10.36 --> 01:14:17.000
is is very important as a matter of fact a consulting firm I used to work for green castle consulting

1105
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:27.16
has expected behaviors that they want their consultants to demonstrate and I think that's a

1106
01:14:27.16 --> 01:14:33.24
a very good way to look at things because you know values are kind of conceptual behaviors are

1107
01:14:33.24 --> 01:14:43.000
more tangible and and I do think you know identifying expected behaviors is really helpful in

1108
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.04
getting your employees to treat customers or treat each other the way you want them to.

1109
01:14:48.76 --> 01:14:56.28
Yeah this is something that I was acutely aware of especially with kids and when I wrote the first

1110
01:14:56.28 --> 01:15:03.88
warrior kid book the whole actually the entire premise of the first book is the kid has to come up with

1111
01:15:03.88 --> 01:15:10.52
a warrior kid code of what he's going to and and his uncle in this book it's a kids book but

1112
01:15:10.52 --> 01:15:15.80
the kid's uncle is uh was it was in the seal teams and so he introduces him he can see that the

1113
01:15:15.80 --> 01:15:20.52
kid's kind of floating around not making the best decisions and so he says hey warriors live by a

1114
01:15:20.52 --> 01:15:27.08
code and I point out you know the Marine Corps values the the the Ranger code the I just point out

1115
01:15:27.08 --> 01:15:32.68
the you know the ancient you know the Samurai code the Viking gods I'm not putting them all in the book

1116
01:15:33.32 --> 01:15:38.60
and say hey you need to make your own code and the kid ends up writing his own code and the uncle

1117
01:15:38.60 --> 01:15:42.52
approves it this warrior kid code and then eventually I wrote another book called the code the

1118
01:15:42.52 --> 01:15:48.60
evaluation of protocols which literally has like a code saying hey as an adult you still need a code

1119
01:15:48.60 --> 01:15:53.24
you still need to figure out what it is you're trying to do what he trying to do with your life and if again

1120
01:15:53.24 --> 01:15:57.64
if you have this code in place hey I want to be healthy cool is that donut gonna help be

1121
01:15:57.64 --> 01:16:04.12
be healthy no it's not don't eat it hey I want to be uh I want to spend quality time with my family

1122
01:16:04.12 --> 01:16:10.84
okay why am I watching TV right now okay don't watch TV if you have something to live by then it's

1123
01:16:10.84 --> 01:16:15.32
gonna make your life that much better and and that's why the the warrior kid code and the

1124
01:16:15.32 --> 01:16:20.76
code evaluation protocol that's the purpose of those say hey listen and and in both those cases

1125
01:16:20.76 --> 01:16:26.20
I say right your own code because you shouldn't follow my code but I can pretty much guarantee you

1126
01:16:26.20 --> 01:16:31.80
most people would have an 80% overlap on what their code is gonna be I mean I might be more into

1127
01:16:31.80 --> 01:16:38.20
you know martial arts than someone else might be more into fishing but if you're gonna focus on

1128
01:16:38.20 --> 01:16:42.04
some part of your life it's gonna be an 80% who doesn't want to be healthy who doesn't want to have a

1129
01:16:42.04 --> 01:16:46.36
good family who doesn't want to be financially successful who wants to save money like all these things

1130
01:16:46.36 --> 01:16:52.12
it's a 90% solution and mate you can make some small adjustments to it but to wander through life without

1131
01:16:52.12 --> 01:16:57.88
that stuff is exactly that it's wandering through life yeah you know jacco i think you putting that

1132
01:16:57.88 --> 01:17:04.84
emphasis on code and in in that book is one of the best things you've ever done because if you

1133
01:17:04.84 --> 01:17:12.76
want to keep people on an ethical path one of the guardrails to to stay on that ethical path is

1134
01:17:12.76 --> 01:17:19.88
by actually writing down what your own personal code is and then that will help you stay grounded

1135
01:17:19.88 --> 01:17:26.04
and help you stay on that path that that's just a great technique to use to keep somebody you know

1136
01:17:26.04 --> 01:17:33.16
staying within those limits because how many times have we seen CEO CEOs governors you know

1137
01:17:33.16 --> 01:17:38.68
stray ethically off the path president yeah president you know anyone in the chain of

1138
01:17:38.68 --> 01:17:44.92
your band yeah bottom of the top yeah and and again it's because they either never took the time to

1139
01:17:44.92 --> 01:17:49.88
write down their own personal code or if they've written a down now they're not paying attention to it

1140
01:17:49.88 --> 01:17:54.92
so I think that's great advice you gave out there um this is one of the sections where I actually

1141
01:17:54.92 --> 01:18:00.92
made a note of your action set section of the book so here here's the actions and you did this

1142
01:18:00.92 --> 01:18:07.000
for every one of these sections you get you identify actions that actually take to move forward

1143
01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.60
and improve this area of leadership so here the actions are identify your own personal core values

1144
01:18:13.56 --> 01:18:18.20
ensure your personal personal core values and the values of the organization you work for our

1145
01:18:18.20 --> 01:18:25.16
aligned when making a decision factor your personal values and your organizations values into your decision

1146
01:18:25.16 --> 01:18:30.84
making process strive to place the welfare and interests of your followers ahead of your own

1147
01:18:31.88 --> 01:18:39.08
and and those are some things and actions that you can take to make this a reality and hey

1148
01:18:39.08 --> 01:18:42.76
identify your own personal core values and write them down it's if something everybody should do

1149
01:18:42.76 --> 01:18:53.80
um section here called cultivating trust and you you get in this situation where it's 1999

1150
01:18:56.68 --> 01:19:02.76
1999 you're going to lift the waneia let me go to the book here the country had regained its

1151
01:19:02.76 --> 01:19:07.32
independence only about six years earlier it was going to be my job to work with the lift

1152
01:19:07.32 --> 01:19:11.88
waneian military to help them understand how the US military function and grow the relationship

1153
01:19:11.88 --> 01:19:17.08
between the US and Lithuania I would have a team of three other US military personnel represented

1154
01:19:17.08 --> 01:19:22.36
their Marines army and air force and the team would also include one Lithuania army officer

1155
01:19:22.36 --> 01:19:25.96
and three Lithuania civilians and this is your coming off I think you're coming off of the

1156
01:19:25.96 --> 01:19:30.52
Italian command at this point so you were just done leading 800 people and now you got a team of

1157
01:19:31.08 --> 01:19:38.20
seven you arrive in Lithuania for this job and I got to read this part after I was on board for a

1158
01:19:38.20 --> 01:19:43.16
couple of weeks I began to come up with what I thought were some excellent ideas instead of tackling

1159
01:19:43.16 --> 01:19:48.04
the work myself I gave began to shoot off yellow sticky notes to everyone giving them tasks to do

1160
01:19:48.04 --> 01:19:52.36
I had plenty of bright ideas and I shot off plenty of taskers to them I thought I was making a

1161
01:19:52.36 --> 01:19:57.000
great impression on the team because of my exceptional ideas however I could not explain it but

1162
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.64
something seemed to be a miss somehow I did not feel the team was comfortable under my leadership

1163
01:20:01.64 --> 01:20:05.96
I had an army reserve major working on my team as an operations officer he was a bright guy

1164
01:20:05.96 --> 01:20:10.52
with an analytical mind and positive demeanor one morning when I was sitting in my office he knocked

1165
01:20:10.52 --> 01:20:15.80
on my door and asked if he could speak to me privately I brightened up I was all about this I thought

1166
01:20:15.80 --> 01:20:22.52
to myself there is a young officer who needs advice from a sage like me the major sat down

1167
01:20:22.52 --> 01:20:29.000
and I asked him what was on his mind his answer floored me he said sir you are tearing this team apart

1168
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:34.60
he went on to say that since I arrived Morales at an all-time low the team's perception of

1169
01:20:34.60 --> 01:20:40.12
my leadership performance was 180 degrees from what I was hoping for their perception was not the

1170
01:20:40.12 --> 01:20:44.92
boss as a sharp guy he has great ideas rather their perception was negative including such

1171
01:20:44.92 --> 01:20:48.68
thoughts as the new boss thinks things are all screwed up here the new boss thinks we are all screwed

1172
01:20:48.68 --> 01:20:53.80
up the new boss thinks we have nothing to do the new boss is not trust us knows the us versus

1173
01:20:53.80 --> 01:20:58.52
him attitude that developed here this is definitely a lesson learned for me thankfully I had someone

1174
01:20:58.52 --> 01:21:03.96
on the team with enough guts to discuss the issue with me I thank the major for the personal

1175
01:21:03.96 --> 01:21:08.60
and moral courage you displayed by discussing the issue with me I had no idea that through my behavior

1176
01:21:08.60 --> 01:21:12.20
and tone I was giving everyone such a negative perception of how I thought they were performing

1177
01:21:13.32 --> 01:21:17.72
you go on here look fast for a little bit what I did to repair trust I immediately met with

1178
01:21:17.72 --> 01:21:21.64
the team members and apologized for the mistake I made I took full ownership of creating a

1179
01:21:21.64 --> 01:21:26.44
perception that I did not trust them I told them I trusted them completely I explained to them

1180
01:21:26.44 --> 01:21:31.000
that I now realized how my behavior was negatively affecting the team I promised them I would change

1181
01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:39.64
my behavior that's a good story yeah and the freaking battalion commander post post battalion commander

1182
01:21:39.64 --> 01:21:45.80
rolling in the good idea fairy yeah we call that you know and and that taught me that whether you

1183
01:21:45.80 --> 01:21:52.04
lead an organization of eight hundred or you lead an organization of eight the leadership challenges are

1184
01:21:52.04 --> 01:21:58.84
there you know it doesn't it doesn't get any easier or harder depending on the number of people you

1185
01:21:58.84 --> 01:22:04.36
lead you know you still got those challenges the the folks on your team are still expecting you to be a

1186
01:22:04.36 --> 01:22:11.96
good leader a positive influence on them and as I mentioned in the book I'm just glad this this

1187
01:22:11.96 --> 01:22:18.20
guy had the the personal courage to come up and and tell me about it because it was really it was

1188
01:22:18.20 --> 01:22:27.16
really life changing for me because that really got me on a journey to really study what trust is all

1189
01:22:27.16 --> 01:22:33.96
about and not only how to cultivate trust but also how to repair trust if if you unfortunately break it

1190
01:22:33.96 --> 01:22:40.36
you know and one thing that is nice is luckily you must have given him some kind of impression

1191
01:22:40.36 --> 01:22:48.36
that you were somewhat approachable and I can guarantee you there's the the the fitness reports of the

1192
01:22:48.36 --> 01:22:52.52
world and evaluations are littered with people that decided they were going to go tell their boss hey

1193
01:22:52.52 --> 01:22:56.60
this is what it looks like and they get scorched for it because the person didn't have an open mind

1194
01:22:56.60 --> 01:23:03.24
and didn't really want to hear them so luckily you had an open mind and were humble enough to say oh

1195
01:23:04.04 --> 01:23:12.04
that's not good I I made a mistake unfortunately the bosses that often times need that sort of

1196
01:23:12.76 --> 01:23:18.84
personal guidance are the types of bosses that aren't open in that type of personal guidance unfortunately yeah

1197
01:23:18.84 --> 01:23:25.24
yeah scary and I'm glad you I'm glad you complimented his moral courage yeah no I realized

1198
01:23:25.24 --> 01:23:31.40
how hard that that was for him and and again I think that the you know the lesson for anybody

1199
01:23:31.40 --> 01:23:37.88
out here listening is hey you know you could be you know you could be a jackass you know if you

1200
01:23:37.88 --> 01:23:42.84
want to be and not be approachable and you know my way or the highway I'm the boss you know

1201
01:23:42.84 --> 01:23:49.32
who are you to tell me what to do we're giving me advice but you're probably only on go so far

1202
01:23:49.32 --> 01:23:56.12
and you know your journey as a leader and if you really want to have long-term success you've

1203
01:23:56.12 --> 01:24:00.04
you've got to follow some of these basic leadership tenants you know

1204
01:24:02.68 --> 01:24:08.36
next chapter what leadership is all about and and and you have a great combat story about

1205
01:24:09.40 --> 01:24:13.32
what is it gunnery sergeant yeah gunnery sergeant Berkhar or master sergeant my heart

1206
01:24:13.32 --> 01:24:19.96
he retired as a master sergeant I'll outstanding just a real real show occurred you can

1207
01:24:19.96 --> 01:24:24.04
told the story on the last podcast you've recited with some more detail in here on the book just

1208
01:24:24.04 --> 01:24:32.28
of a guy that just is unstoppable so I won't cover that right now get the book to read that story

1209
01:24:33.88 --> 01:24:37.88
but you do say this about leadership effective leadership is measured by the results and

1210
01:24:37.88 --> 01:24:43.32
organization achieves after all organizations exist to achieve their purpose and attain results

1211
01:24:43.32 --> 01:24:48.36
leaders cannot attain results on their own leaders must enlist the support of their followers

1212
01:24:48.36 --> 01:24:53.16
to be successful when leaders demonstrate to followers they care by placing their followers well

1213
01:24:53.16 --> 01:24:56.84
fair ahead of their own that is a great way for the leader to gain follower support

1214
01:24:58.60 --> 01:25:02.92
former army chief of staff general Gordon Sullivan in his book hope is not a method

1215
01:25:02.92 --> 01:25:10.28
says our effectiveness as leaders is not so much what we do is as in what influence as what we

1216
01:25:10.28 --> 01:25:16.44
influence others to do a leader must inspire others to be their best and to work toward achieving

1217
01:25:16.44 --> 01:25:22.28
organizational objectives a leaders nothing without support of those here she leads using the

1218
01:25:22.28 --> 01:25:26.84
model of character competence direction and overcoming adversity is a framework for enlisting

1219
01:25:26.84 --> 01:25:33.40
and retaining support which will lead organizational results and success if you're doing your

1220
01:25:33.40 --> 01:25:38.28
jobs a leader the the team is going to be doing what they're supposed to be doing yeah don't forget that

1221
01:25:39.48 --> 01:25:48.12
and you know it's it's all about you know being fortunate enough to have people around you

1222
01:25:48.12 --> 01:25:54.04
like like a gunny Michael Burkhard and one another quick story I want to tell that's not in the

1223
01:25:54.04 --> 01:25:59.56
book I didn't mention it last time but I think it's inspiring we had this one soldier from the

1224
01:25:59.56 --> 01:26:06.12
28th infantry division who came to remind you with this his name was Anthony Jorgensen and again

1225
01:26:06.12 --> 01:26:13.08
we got there in July of 2005 it was in the fall of 2005 he was in an uparmer come via

1226
01:26:13.08 --> 01:26:21.32
Billy was in in the gunners position ID that Nate's causes his uparmer come via a flip over on

1227
01:26:21.32 --> 01:26:27.88
its side he ends up having a broken arm and I think a broken leg both and so get sent back home

1228
01:26:27.88 --> 01:26:35.56
to the United States recovers from his wounds and with sometime in early 2006 he tells the

1229
01:26:35.56 --> 01:26:40.84
leadership in the Pennsylvania Guard hey I want to go back over to her body you know it's like

1230
01:26:40.84 --> 01:26:47.40
they can't be a leave it's kind of like no we are not sending you back so I did have a battalion

1231
01:26:47.40 --> 01:26:53.72
from the Vermont National Guard there with me task organized to my brigade so so this guy

1232
01:26:54.84 --> 01:27:01.48
leaves a Pennsylvania National Guard joins the Vermont National Guard just so he could

1233
01:27:02.28 --> 01:27:06.92
give Vermont to send them back over Remoddy be part of that battalion so he gets back over there

1234
01:27:07.48 --> 01:27:15.08
and then it's April 2006 he's out there on another patrol and he's in a support by fire position

1235
01:27:15.08 --> 01:27:20.36
he's in the the gunners compartment of this uparmer Humvee there's some dismounts going into a building

1236
01:27:21.40 --> 01:27:28.28
that is they believed in surgeons were in and an insurgent fires an RPG a rock

1237
01:27:28.28 --> 01:27:35.56
repelligernade at at this uparmer Humvee that Georgian's in his end and and just like wings it you know

1238
01:27:35.56 --> 01:27:42.84
the slight damage to the Humvee he gets knocked down out of the the gunners hatch gets back up there

1239
01:27:42.84 --> 01:27:49.40
he sees that insurgents are pinning down these dismounts that are out there so he jumps down into

1240
01:27:49.40 --> 01:27:56.92
the driver's compartment drives that uparmer Humvee between where the insurgents are firing and these

1241
01:27:57.64 --> 01:28:02.20
dismounts that were pinned down gets back up into the gunners compartment and lays down

1242
01:28:02.20 --> 01:28:08.92
suppress the fire on these insurgents allowing these dismounts to the disengage and then continue to

1243
01:28:08.92 --> 01:28:17.48
mission all this after suffering these wounds in that attack back in the fall now how many you know

1244
01:28:18.12 --> 01:28:24.52
how many people would you know leave Remoddy with with you know honorable wounds like he did

1245
01:28:24.52 --> 01:28:30.52
and then fight to get back over there and then you know does this heroic action which I believe

1246
01:28:30.52 --> 01:28:37.88
he got a bronze star with V4 for for doing what he did but just just again the reason I want to

1247
01:28:37.88 --> 01:28:45.72
bring that story up is these soldiers are so inspiring and you know we think as leaders we should be

1248
01:28:45.72 --> 01:28:51.88
inspiring our followers but our followers have a way especially in the military of inspiring us and

1249
01:28:51.88 --> 01:28:56.68
some of these stories just have to be told and the knee Jordan said what's he doing now do you know

1250
01:28:56.68 --> 01:29:03.48
yeah he lives up in the scranton area and uh get the after to the scranton area yeah he is so just

1251
01:29:03.48 --> 01:29:10.12
very proud of you know he does for 11 offhand I don't know right on yeah but uh well he

1252
01:29:10.12 --> 01:29:16.20
used to loot you Anthony Jordanson yeah he needs that shout out what a beast yeah yeah I mean you

1253
01:29:16.20 --> 01:29:20.92
get blown up by an ID and thrown out of your vehicle like you say oh he had these wounds you

1254
01:29:20.92 --> 01:29:25.64
he's lucky to be alive after that happens yeah and then you get hit with an RPG

1255
01:29:27.16 --> 01:29:32.68
you're lucky to be alive in home v yeah and again I hope he's playing the lottery up there

1256
01:29:32.68 --> 01:29:39.16
Anthony Jordanson and scrant PA he's got a little some luck he's a guy I'd want you know watch

1257
01:29:39.16 --> 01:29:47.96
him my back any anytime awesome awesome stuff here's an interesting title do not for a chapter

1258
01:29:47.96 --> 01:29:57.88
do not treat everyone equally talk to us about that yeah basically with with that's about is you know

1259
01:29:57.88 --> 01:30:05.64
I don't think leaders should treat everybody on the on the team equally you got and when I say

1260
01:30:05.64 --> 01:30:10.92
that this one I mean by it you got to get to know the the people on your team everybody's a

1261
01:30:10.92 --> 01:30:16.20
little bit different so you got to really get to know what makes them tick and and what's going

1262
01:30:16.20 --> 01:30:23.08
to motivate certain people as opposed to motivating others and so you know you can't treat

1263
01:30:23.08 --> 01:30:27.88
the meek well I think there's a story in there I think about Jimmy Johnson when he coached

1264
01:30:27.88 --> 01:30:34.76
Dallas Cowboys and he was asked by reporter hey you know if if you saw Troy eight men a

1265
01:30:34.76 --> 01:30:41.56
sleep in one of your team meetings and a third string offensive guard a sleep in in your

1266
01:30:41.56 --> 01:30:47.000
team meeting would you treat them the same way and and he answered absolutely not he goes and

1267
01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:52.12
this is what I do he goes I would probably cut that third string offensive guard immediately

1268
01:30:52.12 --> 01:30:56.44
and would Troy eight men I would go up to him and I would kind of nudge him gently awake and I would

1269
01:30:56.44 --> 01:31:02.20
say hey kind of bring a cup of coffee you know so the the point is you know you've got to understand

1270
01:31:02.20 --> 01:31:07.64
the talent to have on your team and and not everybody should be treated equally you know some some

1271
01:31:07.64 --> 01:31:14.28
some people need a kick in the butt some people need a pat on the back another interesting story

1272
01:31:14.28 --> 01:31:21.88
with us a football story you know I I grew up as a green bay packer fan so in 1966 10 years old

1273
01:31:21.88 --> 01:31:27.08
lumbarty you know winning his first super ball I became packer fan so I started to read all kinds

1274
01:31:27.08 --> 01:31:31.32
of books about the packers and there was this one story you know Bart Star who was the quarterback

1275
01:31:31.32 --> 01:31:38.28
for for lumbarty I think it was like the second year lumbarty was the head coach he was just

1276
01:31:38.28 --> 01:31:43.64
chewing Bart Star out relentlessly during this practice and you know talk about moral courage

1277
01:31:44.60 --> 01:31:50.84
after practice Bart Star goes to Coach lumbarty's office and he goes hey coach can I talk to

1278
01:31:50.84 --> 01:31:57.16
privately for a few minutes coach says yeah sure what's up and Star says to him he goes coach he goes

1279
01:31:57.96 --> 01:32:03.56
I don't want you ever chewing me out in front of the team again said I'm the quarterback

1280
01:32:03.56 --> 01:32:08.76
I'm leading this team he goes if they see you chewing me out the way you were chewing me out

1281
01:32:08.76 --> 01:32:13.40
he goes I'm not going to be able to lead this team effectively in the lumbarty light bulb

1282
01:32:13.40 --> 01:32:21.000
an often said any realized he could not treat everybody exactly the same way you know so he never

1283
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:26.92
chewed Bart Star out in front of the team again because he realized that what Star said was exactly

1284
01:32:26.92 --> 01:32:30.92
correct you know he couldn't lead the team effectively if he was going to be treated like that

1285
01:32:31.56 --> 01:32:39.000
and so again just just some great lessons we could learn from from from past leaders and you know

1286
01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.16
I just tried I think we all tried to do our best when we hear these lessons to try to apply

1287
01:32:43.16 --> 01:32:46.44
them if we could you know that's when you when you get a guy like Vincent Barty in the

1288
01:32:46.44 --> 01:32:52.36
reputation that he has and he's humble enough to think oh if he if he can be humble in that situation

1289
01:32:52.36 --> 01:32:57.32
and maybe less than one of his subordinates and say oh he's right I'm wrong that's another indicator

1290
01:32:57.32 --> 01:33:01.64
that you might want to stay humble as a leader you get some stuff to learn no matter who you are

1291
01:33:01.64 --> 01:33:06.52
yeah absolutely you talked earlier about muddy boots leadership and and you tell a story

1292
01:33:06.52 --> 01:33:11.24
and here about you got complimented on the fact that you were in charge but you you were

1293
01:33:11.24 --> 01:33:15.56
your boots were muddy because you've been out in the field going to see and what was happening

1294
01:33:15.56 --> 01:33:20.52
and and and that's a whole concept of getting the field get out there talk to people find

1295
01:33:20.52 --> 01:33:26.28
what's going on in the front lines you say this here a mentor in that same chapter you say a

1296
01:33:26.28 --> 01:33:31.24
mentor of mine told me the personal presence of a leader is probably the greatest key to influencing

1297
01:33:31.24 --> 01:33:36.04
the action once a plan has been put in a motion a leaders presence demonstrates to one's

1298
01:33:36.04 --> 01:33:42.12
followers the importance of the work at hand when the leader is where the action is they are then

1299
01:33:42.12 --> 01:33:49.96
position to motivate others and make timely adjustments when necessary leader sometimes has to go

1300
01:33:49.96 --> 01:33:57.24
to make things happen yeah you know I remember as a young army officer reading and some manual

1301
01:33:57.24 --> 01:34:05.08
somewhere or maybe it was even some senior leader who was coaching me but said you know there's

1302
01:34:05.08 --> 01:34:13.08
three things a commander could do to positively impact the battle once it begins he said the

1303
01:34:13.08 --> 01:34:22.52
commanders use of fires you know close air support and direct fire the use of the reserves

1304
01:34:22.52 --> 01:34:28.60
you know because usually the commander retains the authority of when to use his reserve and the

1305
01:34:28.60 --> 01:34:36.12
third thing is personal presence on the battlefield and he said those are the three things a commander

1306
01:34:36.12 --> 01:34:43.40
could do to influence the battle once it begins and and that always stuck to me stuck with me especially

1307
01:34:43.40 --> 01:34:48.92
that notion of the personal presence on the battlefield and just having that personal presence there

1308
01:34:48.92 --> 01:34:57.32
which help I think you know soldiers in battle or in a civilian sector you know employees in

1309
01:34:57.32 --> 01:35:03.72
an organization realize that hey this leaders out with us sharing the load sharing the danger

1310
01:35:04.92 --> 01:35:12.12
you know sharing what's coming our way and and you know they kind of get bolstered by that whole notion

1311
01:35:12.12 --> 01:35:15.88
well I can attest to that I remember seeing you out on the battlefield the

1312
01:35:15.88 --> 01:35:20.92
body looking over and say well there's the brigade commander I Roger that I guess he's I guess he's

1313
01:35:20.92 --> 01:35:26.52
not sitting back in the talk all the time he's out here with the troops like you said seeing what's

1314
01:35:26.52 --> 01:35:31.000
happening understanding what's happening and taking that risk I mean if you were in Ramadi

1315
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:38.44
and you were out in the city you were at risk and IEDs and and roadside bombs and RPGs and

1316
01:35:38.44 --> 01:35:42.28
and machine guns don't they don't care what your name is they don't care what your rank is

1317
01:35:42.28 --> 01:35:46.76
they'll they'll kill you one way or the other if they want to yeah you know I did try to get out

1318
01:35:46.76 --> 01:35:52.92
there a lot not because I had any type of you know courage to speak of but just because I felt

1319
01:35:52.92 --> 01:35:59.000
it was necessary to do and the other thing for any military leader listening to this and

1320
01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:04.52
and really it applies to business leaders too I would encourage my staff to get out there

1321
01:36:05.24 --> 01:36:10.60
and and the reason I encourage my staff to get out there is because I felt it was important for my

1322
01:36:10.60 --> 01:36:18.04
staff to also gain ground truth if if if the staff was gaining with they thought was to truth

1323
01:36:18.04 --> 01:36:24.76
from reading reports they were missing about 80% of what was happening so although I know you know

1324
01:36:24.76 --> 01:36:29.72
in the military a lot of times especially in operations like that the staff needs to be back

1325
01:36:29.72 --> 01:36:36.12
doing staff work I always encourage them that hey they they did have to make time to actually get

1326
01:36:36.12 --> 01:36:43.16
out there talk to troops see areas with their own eyes and again just a history from lesson

1327
01:36:43.16 --> 01:36:50.36
hurt and force 28th infantry division fighting in the hurt and forest in in November 1944 the battle

1328
01:36:50.36 --> 01:36:59.000
of Schmidt was a devastating time for the 28th infantry division in about four days over 6,000

1329
01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:05.80
casualties and one thing that was written about that period is it's said that general code

1330
01:37:05.80 --> 01:37:11.88
to who is a division commander at the time most reports I read said he never even went as far

1331
01:37:11.88 --> 01:37:18.28
forward as one of his regimental command posts and the staff did not go forward either so

1332
01:37:18.28 --> 01:37:23.08
they didn't realize that the call trail through the hurt and forest which they were sending

1333
01:37:23.08 --> 01:37:29.80
Sherman tank down Sherman tank is eight and a half feet wide the call trail was nine feet wide

1334
01:37:29.80 --> 01:37:37.16
I mean it was not a good you know means you know MSR means supply route or or good route of any

1335
01:37:37.16 --> 01:37:43.80
sort for those tanks to be going along and so to lessen there is because the commander didn't get

1336
01:37:43.80 --> 01:37:47.40
out on the battlefield because the staff didn't get out there they were relying on maps

1337
01:37:47.40 --> 01:37:55.64
they didn't get the full understanding of what that hurt and forest area was was like so

1338
01:37:55.64 --> 01:38:00.20
again for any civilian leader any military leader absolutely important not only to get out

1339
01:38:00.20 --> 01:38:05.32
there yourself but to get your your staff the ones that you depend on to advise you to get out there

1340
01:38:05.32 --> 01:38:10.76
as well you know there's another piece of this when when you are the leader and you what

1341
01:38:10.76 --> 01:38:13.64
you're supposed to be doing is you're supposed to be detached you're not supposed to go out there

1342
01:38:13.64 --> 01:38:17.96
and get in the firefighter not supposed to go out there and and run the marketing meeting or meet

1343
01:38:17.96 --> 01:38:23.96
with the client necessarily or get and start manufacturing stuff on the line you're supposed to

1344
01:38:23.96 --> 01:38:28.92
go out and look do you do you maybe do a couple moves on the manufacturing line to make sure you

1345
01:38:28.92 --> 01:38:33.24
understand what's happening yes but you don't start manufacturing things you come in from a

1346
01:38:33.24 --> 01:38:38.04
different perspective you come in with a different perspective and then what you have to look for

1347
01:38:38.04 --> 01:38:44.52
as a leader is you have to make sure that things are going in the right direction and the

1348
01:38:44.52 --> 01:38:50.60
test that you should put on yourself is like it the basically the momentum is the momentum that

1349
01:38:50.60 --> 01:38:56.84
we're going in correct because the momentum could be wrong and the momentum could be right and

1350
01:38:56.84 --> 01:39:01.16
if the momentum is right cool you can just get out of the way if the momentum is wrong that's

1351
01:39:01.16 --> 01:39:04.52
we're going to have to step in and stop it and and one of the places where you see this is

1352
01:39:04.52 --> 01:39:10.92
well in combat when things lag you know you get an element that's not moving as quickly as they're

1353
01:39:10.92 --> 01:39:16.20
supposed to move they're lagging they're moving too slow and they don't even realize that they can't

1354
01:39:16.20 --> 01:39:19.96
realize it because they're doing it you can come in and say hey we got to step it up hey we need to

1355
01:39:19.96 --> 01:39:25.16
push that next building so when that when an element is lagging a leader can step in and move things

1356
01:39:25.16 --> 01:39:31.72
quicker and they should because that's the the momentum is inertia the momentum is hey we're going

1357
01:39:31.72 --> 01:39:35.80
slow we're being methodical but they need to move faster the leaders got to make that happen there's

1358
01:39:35.80 --> 01:39:40.04
also times the leader steps in and says hey need to slow down guys are moving too quick you guys are

1359
01:39:40.04 --> 01:39:46.60
taking you not not taking too many risks slow it down so there's all these situations where I think

1360
01:39:46.60 --> 01:39:52.28
what the leader needs to be cognizant cognizant of in their mind when they step into these situations

1361
01:39:52.28 --> 01:39:58.44
is the momentum we have is the crowd is the mob moving in the right direction if they are great

1362
01:39:58.44 --> 01:40:02.52
get out of their way let them keep going but if they're not that's when your opportunity comes to

1363
01:40:02.52 --> 01:40:08.60
a straighten it out and check it yeah it's not and it's not just about speed it's about tempo and

1364
01:40:09.56 --> 01:40:16.60
a couple of things came to mind Jaco as you were talking one is my personal security detachment

1365
01:40:16.60 --> 01:40:22.52
in Ramadi you know it was generally for a farmer at home v's I had a platoon the platoon leaders

1366
01:40:22.52 --> 01:40:30.12
named Ajax myth just just an excellent leader and early on as we were out there with me

1367
01:40:31.88 --> 01:40:39.56
being transported by this when we when we moved mounted by this for a farmer humv formation

1368
01:40:41.56 --> 01:40:46.92
you know I was kind of on the radio directing the movement of these for a farmer humv and

1369
01:40:46.92 --> 01:40:52.28
and uh... joc Smith you know to be telling you looks at me goes sir he goes you're you're leading

1370
01:40:52.28 --> 01:40:57.96
the brigade because let me lead this platoon and i and i said you know why joc you're exactly

1371
01:40:57.96 --> 01:41:02.68
right i'm gonna shut up you know we're out when i when we're out here this is your platoon you're

1372
01:41:02.68 --> 01:41:08.04
going to lead it i'm going i'm not going to say a damn word about how how you should maneuver this

1373
01:41:08.04 --> 01:41:14.36
platoon because he was right i had i had a brigade lead and the other story is command sergeant major

1374
01:41:14.36 --> 01:41:19.40
uh... crisp capillary was my command sergeant major when i commanded twenty-eighth infantry

1375
01:41:19.40 --> 01:41:25.40
division uh he used to say uh as he would go out and talk to the leaders and coach and mentor

1376
01:41:25.40 --> 01:41:32.68
leaders he would he would say leaders could stop things from getting screwed up just by the fact

1377
01:41:32.68 --> 01:41:38.92
that they were there just by their mere presence uh so you know that's why it's so important again

1378
01:41:38.92 --> 01:41:44.12
you know for for leaders to get out there because people are going to do the right thing

1379
01:41:44.12 --> 01:41:53.40
and adhere to those standards when they know to leader is is there uh i was uh down in florida

1380
01:41:53.40 --> 01:41:58.68
uh a while back doing some leadership training for a sheriff's department down there and one of the

1381
01:41:58.68 --> 01:42:04.60
the deputy sheriff's was speaking to a group of corporals and he told the story how in the in the

1382
01:42:04.60 --> 01:42:13.32
in the jail there uh how uh some deputies that should have been in the kitchen watching the

1383
01:42:13.32 --> 01:42:20.28
prisoners do what they were doing uh you know cooking the meal uh just neglected to be there as

1384
01:42:20.28 --> 01:42:28.20
they should and things really got out of hand and his point was just because the sergeant

1385
01:42:28.20 --> 01:42:33.000
wasn't going down and checking to make sure those deputies were doing the right thing they

1386
01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.16
you know the human beings are just decided hey you know this must be that important because

1387
01:42:37.16 --> 01:42:42.44
nobody's checking on us so we're not going to be doing the right thing and so his point was again

1388
01:42:42.44 --> 01:42:47.40
just by the mere fact of a leader being present they're going to fix things just by being there

1389
01:42:48.68 --> 01:42:55.32
this is a reminds me of of another chapter in the book here chapter 11 an organization's personality

1390
01:42:55.32 --> 01:43:00.76
say in 1985 i took command of an infantry company in the 28th infantry division Pennsylvania National

1391
01:43:00.76 --> 01:43:04.36
Guard the infantry company i commanded was designated alpha company second battalion hundred and

1392
01:43:04.36 --> 01:43:09.32
ninth infantry and the unit had an authorized strength of 144 soldiers i was honored to have an

1393
01:43:09.32 --> 01:43:13.08
opportunity to lead the commission officers non-commission officers and soldiers assigned to the

1394
01:43:13.08 --> 01:43:18.60
outfit i remembered reading an army leadership manual earlier in the in my career before taking this

1395
01:43:18.60 --> 01:43:22.92
command in the manual there was a statement i will never forget it's at a military unit

1396
01:43:23.48 --> 01:43:29.48
and any organization for that matter takes on the personality of its leader when reading that

1397
01:43:29.48 --> 01:43:35.72
statement as a young inexperienced leader i doubted it i could not believe a unit of almost 150 soldiers

1398
01:43:35.72 --> 01:43:40.60
would take on my personality i did not believe someone like me could have that type of impact

1399
01:43:40.60 --> 01:43:46.84
whereby over a hundred of the people assigned would take on my traits based on my experience

1400
01:43:46.84 --> 01:43:51.64
commanding that company i learned i was wrong and the leadership manual is correct and organization

1401
01:43:51.64 --> 01:43:56.44
will take on the personality of its leader in my case the commander i took over for was a good man

1402
01:43:56.44 --> 01:44:01.24
however his focus seemed to be more on being a nice guy than on emphasizing physical fitness and

1403
01:44:01.24 --> 01:44:06.28
tough training that was exactly what the person personality of the unit was when i took command everyone

1404
01:44:06.28 --> 01:44:10.52
got along have no comfortable but many of the soldiers were laxed on their fitness levels and the

1405
01:44:10.52 --> 01:44:14.68
unit did not go in the field much to conduct rigorous training i believe soldiers need to be

1406
01:44:14.68 --> 01:44:18.76
an excellent physical condition and i also believed infantry soldiers needed to train rigorously

1407
01:44:18.76 --> 01:44:22.84
in field conditions be experts with their weapons and take excellent care of their equipment

1408
01:44:22.84 --> 01:44:27.56
over time the unit took on a tough persona this was ratified by our brigade commander when

1409
01:44:27.56 --> 01:44:32.20
he selected our unit train at the national training center at fort or when california

1410
01:44:32.20 --> 01:44:36.28
late nineteen eighty this is a big deal and an honor for national guard company to be selected

1411
01:44:36.28 --> 01:44:43.48
for that training so there you go yeah the case in point yeah the the next section i wanted to just

1412
01:44:43.48 --> 01:44:47.96
jump into and it's called decision making and there's some tap some topics in here and that

1413
01:44:47.96 --> 01:44:55.000
you write about and i just want to kind of do a high level review of some of these some of these

1414
01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:02.20
uh sections one of them's hit the ground running um which means when you show up get started

1415
01:45:04.20 --> 01:45:10.92
get your butt in gear yeah yeah another one's character is foundational again this is what we're

1416
01:45:10.92 --> 01:45:16.52
doing what we're doing this is who we are and if we don't have good character hey listen

1417
01:45:17.16 --> 01:45:20.84
if you don't have good character you might be able to get away with it for a little while you might

1418
01:45:20.84 --> 01:45:26.36
even be able to weasel out a promotion because you you maneuvered and you manipulated it and

1419
01:45:26.36 --> 01:45:30.44
you took credit where you didn't and you didn't give credit to the team or you still you might

1420
01:45:30.44 --> 01:45:35.72
you might even get a promotion you might even get two promotions they can happen but eventually

1421
01:45:35.72 --> 01:45:41.48
it's not it's not gonna last no no you know uh a friend of mine lend me a rella

1422
01:45:41.48 --> 01:45:47.08
he graduated from west point in like nineteen fifty eight or something uh retired as a colonel and

1423
01:45:47.08 --> 01:45:54.44
the army he wrote this book uh about character and in the book he would go and interview different

1424
01:45:54.44 --> 01:46:00.20
leaders who were known to be character based leaders and one of the people he interviewed was coach

1425
01:46:00.20 --> 01:46:08.44
Krishewski coach K from Duke and uh in the in this interview he was doing with coach K you know

1426
01:46:08.44 --> 01:46:13.24
lend lends to coach K like what this character have to do with winning a basketball game

1427
01:46:13.24 --> 01:46:22.28
and coach K's answer was you know character has absolutely nothing at all to do with winning a

1428
01:46:22.28 --> 01:46:31.08
basketball game but it has everything to do with winning a championship you know and exactly what

1429
01:46:31.08 --> 01:46:35.32
you said you know you might have a win here there if you're not character based but if you want to

1430
01:46:35.32 --> 01:46:40.52
be a champion if you want to have long term success you got to be a character based leader at least

1431
01:46:40.52 --> 01:46:47.96
that's where I believe um another sub headline here is know your job and do your job and this

1432
01:46:47.96 --> 01:46:53.64
I might might know that I took on this one it is there is such a thing as a stupid question

1433
01:46:53.64 --> 01:46:56.92
and when we explain the you people always say oh there's no such thing as a stupid question

1434
01:46:56.92 --> 01:47:04.60
if you show up to a job and you're gonna be in charge of a tank and you say hey what's the

1435
01:47:04.60 --> 01:47:09.88
name of this vehicle how far can this gun shoot how many rounds can we get a if you're asking

1436
01:47:09.88 --> 01:47:13.80
questions that you should have done some research and know when you showed up you're wrong if you

1437
01:47:13.80 --> 01:47:18.52
show up to a manufacturer to run a manufacturing plant and you show up and say hey what is it

1438
01:47:18.52 --> 01:47:23.000
we're making or how many employees do we have or who's in charge of the day shift if you're

1439
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:27.64
asking questions that a little bit of research could have answered that you didn't do a good job

1440
01:47:27.64 --> 01:47:32.92
prepare you don't you so know your job that's my part of know your job there is stupid questions

1441
01:47:32.92 --> 01:47:36.04
don't show up your first day and ask stupid questions that you should have known if you're

1442
01:47:36.04 --> 01:47:42.68
taking an ounce of effort to to figure out what was happening you know you're exactly right I mean

1443
01:47:43.48 --> 01:47:49.32
you got to put forth some of that effort now if it's some type of you know in a you know technical

1444
01:47:49.96 --> 01:47:53.40
you know in a thing that maybe a guy with ten years experience would know and you wouldn't know

1445
01:47:53.40 --> 01:47:57.96
hey that's that's fine and you can ask those questions all day long yeah yeah but it's just showing

1446
01:47:57.96 --> 01:48:03.16
you really don't care if you didn't you know take the time to do that type of research before

1447
01:48:03.16 --> 01:48:10.20
coming into job for sure you say take on tough assignments and this is there's a this is this is

1448
01:48:10.20 --> 01:48:15.000
just a good thing across the board you're going to learn a lot you're going to show everyone that

1449
01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:20.28
you don't you'll take the not just the tough ones but the crappy ones hey no one wants to work this

1450
01:48:20.28 --> 01:48:28.12
weekend cool I got it hmm one of my buddies uh sestone who's in romadi with us he was he was on a

1451
01:48:28.12 --> 01:48:35.000
ship he was a ship driver in the navy and they had his his department got assigned to do some cleaning

1452
01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:40.76
like they hadn't been in port for a while and his department got assigned to clean whatever

1453
01:48:40.76 --> 01:48:47.16
and uh I heard this after he died someone the story got passed to his brother was uh you know

1454
01:48:47.16 --> 01:48:54.04
at as his department was leaving for liberty they looked up and they saw he was cleaning whatever

1455
01:48:54.04 --> 01:48:58.20
it was they were assigned to clean and he had just said you know what I'm gonna let the guys go

1456
01:48:58.20 --> 01:49:02.36
and go on liberty and I'm gonna do whatever meanial task we've been told to do and he was the

1457
01:49:02.36 --> 01:49:07.40
guy in charge of the department so do the do the tough ones do the crappy ones too yeah yeah and again

1458
01:49:07.40 --> 01:49:11.48
you know all in line would hit the ground running you know a lot of people say don't volunteer for

1459
01:49:11.48 --> 01:49:16.68
anything right you know I think that's a big mistake tell me you you you you got a volunteer to take

1460
01:49:16.68 --> 01:49:22.76
on those tough things and and when you do that you know a couple of benefits first of all nobody's

1461
01:49:22.76 --> 01:49:29.32
gonna expect you to succeed if you're just starting it you're you know out in your career you know

1462
01:49:29.32 --> 01:49:34.12
you're not gonna have high expectations if you're just starting out and so by tackling those

1463
01:49:34.12 --> 01:49:39.08
tough things gaining that experience you know it's just like you know in the military you know a

1464
01:49:39.08 --> 01:49:44.92
second lieutenant army to lowest ranking commissioned officer you're expecting a second lieutenant to

1465
01:49:44.92 --> 01:49:51.000
make a mistake you know so that's the time to take on those tough assignments gain that experience

1466
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:57.08
make some of those mistakes learn from them and you know hopefully have the right leaders

1467
01:49:57.08 --> 01:50:01.16
guiding you along the way and that that's how you're really gonna get off to a good start and be

1468
01:50:01.16 --> 01:50:07.88
successful another one developed your leadership philosophy early but continue to refine

1469
01:50:08.44 --> 01:50:12.84
and this is once again important even Vince Lombardi refined his philosophy

1470
01:50:12.84 --> 01:50:21.08
that's what you need to do come up with a philosophy but then refine it make it better as time goes on

1471
01:50:21.96 --> 01:50:27.16
next section here is his competence and I don't know if you did this on purpose but some of

1472
01:50:27.16 --> 01:50:32.12
your chapter titles have a little bit of you know that you're gonna get some rise out of some

1473
01:50:32.12 --> 01:50:37.96
people this one's not everyone deserves a mentor yeah kind of did that on purpose what do you

1474
01:50:37.96 --> 01:50:45.000
be right that one you know and again this gets back to an infantry conference I was at

1475
01:50:45.88 --> 01:50:52.04
in general cone you know he since passed away but he was I think the trade-ock commander at the time

1476
01:50:52.76 --> 01:50:58.12
speaking to us there and he basically said that during his remarks and it's like wow you know that

1477
01:50:58.12 --> 01:51:02.84
kind of hit me you know like like a brick hit in me in the face it's like well what's he talking about

1478
01:51:02.84 --> 01:51:11.24
but but what he went on to say and which what I have you know come to to see as true is

1479
01:51:12.04 --> 01:51:17.32
you know not everybody deserves a mentor because if you're not out there actively looking for a

1480
01:51:17.32 --> 01:51:23.88
mentor for somebody to you know somebody's example to follow you probably don't deserve a mentor and I

1481
01:51:23.88 --> 01:51:29.96
remember even as a as a young officer thinking you know hey nobody's mentoring me you know what

1482
01:51:29.96 --> 01:51:35.88
what's up with this you know and I was expecting some you know gray beard you know to sit me down

1483
01:51:35.88 --> 01:51:40.68
at their side and tell me all the facts of how to lead but hey that that doesn't happen

1484
01:51:41.40 --> 01:51:47.16
and then I realized mentorship is happening all around us all we got to do is look for it for it so

1485
01:51:47.16 --> 01:51:56.36
again if you're a young executive in a company you know and you're observing how

1486
01:51:56.36 --> 01:52:04.04
one of the senior leaders in that company is acting how they're talking to people how they're

1487
01:52:04.04 --> 01:52:09.48
relating to people and you're learning the good and the bad from that that's actually mentorship

1488
01:52:10.92 --> 01:52:16.76
and you know mentorship is all around us if we just look just look for it but nobody should expect

1489
01:52:16.76 --> 01:52:21.48
somebody to kind of sit us down and tell us about hey these these are the things you really

1490
01:52:21.48 --> 01:52:25.88
got to look out for that that's that realistic that's just just not going to happen

1491
01:52:29.16 --> 01:52:36.20
know it is not uh chapter 18 this one's always a big topic getting buy in

1492
01:52:37.72 --> 01:52:44.12
Napoleon used a technique to obtain buy in it was the same technique used by the union general

1493
01:52:44.12 --> 01:52:50.36
who commanded the army of the platomic at Gettysburg general meat meat was a disciple of Napoleon

1494
01:52:50.36 --> 01:52:57.56
the technique was called a war council on July 2nd 1863 mead brought his lieutenant into his

1495
01:52:57.56 --> 01:53:03.80
makeshift headquarters at the lifester house he had in a agenda that evening the council had

1496
01:53:03.80 --> 01:53:10.84
to provide their recommendations on one of three courses of action mead would have to decide one

1497
01:53:11.48 --> 01:53:16.28
the union army should leave the battlefield to the union army should stay in fight and offensive

1498
01:53:16.28 --> 01:53:23.000
battle three the union army should stay and fight a defensive battle mead began by asking his

1499
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:28.20
lower ranking and least experienced lieutenant to voice their opinions first he used this method

1500
01:53:28.20 --> 01:53:33.80
because he knew if the more senior officer spoke first more junior officers in terms of rank

1501
01:53:33.80 --> 01:53:40.04
reputation or experience might feel too intimidated to disagree after all this was by design a

1502
01:53:40.04 --> 01:53:46.12
hierarchical organization mead knew he had to get the lower ranking leaders to speak first in order

1503
01:53:46.12 --> 01:53:52.36
to get their unvarnished thoughts after everyone spoke mead decided the union would stay in fight

1504
01:53:52.36 --> 01:53:57.48
a defensive battle the rest as they say is history the union army was victorious and won the

1505
01:53:57.48 --> 01:54:01.80
battle and would go on to win the war although would take another bloody two years before the

1506
01:54:01.80 --> 01:54:11.72
Confederate army laid down their arms I when when people asked me this question how do you get

1507
01:54:11.72 --> 01:54:16.68
people to buy into the plan I say let them come up with a plan you don't have to worry about

1508
01:54:16.68 --> 01:54:21.64
buying anymore you don't have to worry about you came up with it I'm buying into your plan

1509
01:54:21.64 --> 01:54:26.36
and I can do that easily I can control my own thoughts and if you come if John comes up with a

1510
01:54:26.36 --> 01:54:34.12
plan that's pretty decent I'm cool with it and and we'll go with it yeah yeah you know as a leader

1511
01:54:34.12 --> 01:54:39.88
I found you know give the task give the purpose but don't give the how you know give the what

1512
01:54:39.88 --> 01:54:46.60
and the why but not the how and usually you know those people who work for us are going to figure

1513
01:54:46.60 --> 01:54:51.88
out a better way to do with them we would have figured out so yeah you know let them run with it

1514
01:54:52.92 --> 01:55:00.20
in any organization usually those people with a grassroots level have they're they're closer to the

1515
01:55:00.20 --> 01:55:05.72
problem set so turn it over to them now yeah you might have to provide a little bit of guidance

1516
01:55:05.72 --> 01:55:13.000
you might have to you know kind of you know just just adjust one way or other but essentially

1517
01:55:14.44 --> 01:55:18.92
you know give me them the what and why and let them figure out the how is generally the best

1518
01:55:18.92 --> 01:55:22.44
way to handle it and I'll get leaders say well what if my what if my support has come up with a

1519
01:55:22.44 --> 01:55:25.88
stupid plan I'm gonna say well it's wrong with you if you've got support instead of coming up with a

1520
01:55:25.88 --> 01:55:29.64
stupid plan yeah I'll tell you what's wrong you haven't trained them properly you haven't given the

1521
01:55:29.64 --> 01:55:33.64
the right mentorship and guidance you haven't let them come up with plans before so they could learn

1522
01:55:33.64 --> 01:55:38.60
how to plan better so if they come up with a stupid plan what do you do you start asking them some

1523
01:55:38.60 --> 01:55:42.76
earnest questions about their plan and kind of it reveals to them what some of the holes in their

1524
01:55:42.76 --> 01:55:47.88
plan are and then they can make adjustments and while they're making adjustments they're also learning

1525
01:55:47.88 --> 01:55:52.28
so the next time you ask them asking them to come up with a plan it's may not be a brilliant plan

1526
01:55:52.28 --> 01:55:56.92
but at least it's less stupid than the first plan and you look up in three months or six months

1527
01:55:56.92 --> 01:56:00.28
all of a sudden their planning is outstanding you look up an ear and they're probably planning

1528
01:56:00.28 --> 01:56:03.40
better than you are because like you said they're the ones that are closest to the problem yeah

1529
01:56:03.40 --> 01:56:08.12
and you know what you said a little bit earlier I think is exactly true you know sometimes

1530
01:56:08.84 --> 01:56:13.40
you know our followers will come up with a plan that isn't exactly the way we would do it

1531
01:56:13.40 --> 01:56:18.12
but you know I let them run with it anyway you know as long as you know it's not flawed in any

1532
01:56:18.12 --> 01:56:23.32
way it's just a different way than I would have thought of doing it and and I think that's really where

1533
01:56:23.32 --> 01:56:29.000
leaders have to leave their ego at the door you know to say you know hey this isn't the way I do it

1534
01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.60
but it's going to get the job done it's still going to be cost effective or you know whatever

1535
01:56:32.60 --> 01:56:38.04
the case might be so so let them go forward with it and it's you know like you said you don't have

1536
01:56:38.04 --> 01:56:42.84
to worry about the buying if they came up with that I go into every meeting with my subordinates

1537
01:56:42.84 --> 01:56:47.40
when I was in a pool tune when I was a task in a commander right now in the business world I walk

1538
01:56:47.40 --> 01:56:52.36
into a meeting with my people my goals to use their plan that's my goal I don't want to use

1539
01:56:52.36 --> 01:56:56.12
whatever I'm coming up with I want to use theirs and if you have that goal at the beginning

1540
01:56:56.12 --> 01:57:00.04
that's going to lead you to the best possible place and look like you said if their plan is

1541
01:57:00.04 --> 01:57:05.08
dumb which which you know you get to people come up with some dumb plans occasionally

1542
01:57:05.08 --> 01:57:09.48
but occasionally some people come up with some dumb ideas that's okay ask them some earnest questions

1543
01:57:09.48 --> 01:57:14.76
and they're going to see that their plan is the reality of their plan which is dumb yeah yeah

1544
01:57:14.76 --> 01:57:20.36
and and you know this kind of leads into the whole you know asking your followers with their

1545
01:57:20.36 --> 01:57:25.48
recommendation is and you know some some followers are going to come up with some type of crazy

1546
01:57:25.48 --> 01:57:31.96
recommendation that you're just no longer your experience it ain't going to work but I think

1547
01:57:31.96 --> 01:57:37.64
what leaders need to do is then get back with those followers and explain to the follower hey

1548
01:57:37.64 --> 01:57:43.24
this is why I didn't use your recommendation now again I'm you know talking about situations where

1549
01:57:43.24 --> 01:57:47.40
there's time to have those conversations you know if you're in the middle of the firefight

1550
01:57:47.96 --> 01:57:52.52
you know you got to sometimes a you know go left not right whatever but I'm just saying you know

1551
01:57:52.52 --> 01:57:58.20
and and most situations where you're asking for recommendations on some type of long-term plan

1552
01:57:58.20 --> 01:58:02.12
you're putting together somebody comes up with something wet you know that's really wacko

1553
01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:08.20
and you're not going to use it I do think you show people the respect by at least getting back

1554
01:58:08.20 --> 01:58:12.36
with them and explaining to them why I'm not going to use your plan yeah because that's it

1555
01:58:12.36 --> 01:58:16.68
you're it's also your opportunity to teach them why that plan wasn't good and again I'll do it

1556
01:58:16.68 --> 01:58:21.40
by just by saying hey John I want to ask you about you know this this channelized area that you

1557
01:58:21.40 --> 01:58:25.80
want to take your patrol through do you think that's the best approach to the target going through

1558
01:58:25.80 --> 01:58:30.20
this valley where there's elevated positions on both sides that could be occupied by the enemy

1559
01:58:30.20 --> 01:58:35.80
and you'll look at me and say you know I'm possibly get back to you and you'll come up with a different

1560
01:58:35.80 --> 01:58:43.32
plan exactly um fast forward a little bit you got a section in here talking about tactical patience

1561
01:58:43.32 --> 01:58:48.68
which is a concept everybody needs and I think it's the younger you are the morning you need to

1562
01:58:48.68 --> 01:58:53.96
understand tactical patience because the younger you are the less tactical patience you generally

1563
01:58:53.96 --> 01:58:58.52
have and that goes all the way to like little children that are four years old they have the least

1564
01:58:58.52 --> 01:59:02.44
amount of tactical patience so you talk about that but what I like here is you also throw in a

1565
01:59:02.44 --> 01:59:09.16
section that is is called what tactical patience is not demonstrating tactical patience is not about

1566
01:59:09.16 --> 01:59:14.36
putting off a decision it is about taking the time when you have the luxury of having time

1567
01:59:14.36 --> 01:59:19.16
to think through the information available and the recommendations before deciding just as nothing

1568
01:59:19.16 --> 01:59:25.56
happened in business before somebody sells something nothing happens in business until the leader decides

1569
01:59:25.56 --> 01:59:30.76
good leaders have to have the courage to make a decision with less than perfect information

1570
01:59:32.04 --> 01:59:38.36
so it's good to be tactical repation but also there comes a time where you got to make a call

1571
01:59:38.36 --> 01:59:46.20
yeah absolutely and you know jack well you know the CEO at general electric for for 20 years

1572
01:59:46.92 --> 01:59:54.36
I think from like 81 until 2001 you know he he wrote in one of his books that the problem he saw

1573
01:59:54.36 --> 02:00:00.76
with middle-level managers throughout general electric is the the unsuccessful ones were the ones

1574
02:00:00.76 --> 02:00:05.64
who did not have the courage to make a decision and again when you make a decision you're putting

1575
02:00:05.64 --> 02:00:12.28
yourself out there and and some leaders just don't want to take that you know that risk to put

1576
02:00:12.28 --> 02:00:19.08
themselves out there and and potentially make the wrong decision but it's so important because again

1577
02:00:20.52 --> 02:00:26.36
once you make a decision that doesn't mean that you have to stick by that decision no matter what you know

1578
02:00:26.36 --> 02:00:32.44
you've got to assess what's going on you know get some feedback about what's actually happening

1579
02:00:32.44 --> 02:00:37.64
out there you know the real deal and then you know make those adjustments as you go but anybody

1580
02:00:37.64 --> 02:00:42.76
who thinks that hey once I made this decision I can't I can't deviate from it I don't think that's a

1581
02:00:42.76 --> 02:00:46.76
good technique yeah that's a technique that I talk about in leadership strategy tactics

1582
02:00:47.48 --> 02:00:52.28
book is I call it a derivative decision making I'm going to make the smallest decisions I can

1583
02:00:52.28 --> 02:00:57.80
you know you want me to go a salt to part of the city of Ramadi I say hey got it boss

1584
02:00:57.80 --> 02:01:01.96
we're going to take one building we're going to start with this one little building over here and see how

1585
02:01:01.96 --> 02:01:05.56
that goes and if like we get a good foothold and now we can put some troops in a good spot now I

1586
02:01:05.56 --> 02:01:10.44
can go to the next building I don't send you know all my troops and a bunch of different buildings

1587
02:01:10.44 --> 02:01:15.16
at the same time no I'm going to make small steps in that direction and and then it's very easy

1588
02:01:15.16 --> 02:01:18.52
for me to make adjustments it's a very easy for me to say oh you know what hey boss I'm going to need

1589
02:01:18.52 --> 02:01:23.000
more troops or hey boss this doesn't make sense right now there's his way more fortified than we

1590
02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:27.48
thought it was going to be whatever the case maybe I can make adjustments but I start off by making

1591
02:01:27.48 --> 02:01:31.88
very small decisions and then adjusting and the other thing that that I was thinking about what you

1592
02:01:31.88 --> 02:01:38.20
were saying that is when you were talking about Jack Welch and the middle-level managers failing

1593
02:01:38.20 --> 02:01:42.20
to make decisions because they don't want to put themselves out there and this reminds me of what

1594
02:01:42.20 --> 02:01:47.48
you were talking about earlier and what's in the book the idea of forming like scar tissue and

1595
02:01:47.48 --> 02:01:53.88
and the habit if you get in the habit of saying hey look I made a decision wasn't the best call

1596
02:01:53.88 --> 02:01:58.92
my it's on me here's the adjustment we're going to make once you realize that that doesn't

1597
02:01:58.92 --> 02:02:03.32
it's not the end of the world to do that now I can tell you can you can you do that to an extent

1598
02:02:03.32 --> 02:02:07.24
where people go they they jocquoise just nothing but bad decisions and every decision he makes

1599
02:02:07.24 --> 02:02:11.000
because hey my mistake hey this one is my mistake hey sorry guys this was my mistake eventually

1600
02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:16.44
you're going to lose some credibility you can't just make bad decisions all the time but if you

1601
02:02:16.44 --> 02:02:22.36
make decisions hey even what is it a a broken clock is right twice a day you're going to be right

1602
02:02:22.36 --> 02:02:26.68
some of the times you know if you're doing a good assessment you make a decision and it turns out to be wrong

1603
02:02:27.24 --> 02:02:31.56
hey guys sorry my fault that we should have gone in different directions here's the adjustment we're

1604
02:02:31.56 --> 02:02:36.76
making people don't lose respect for you they gain respect for you but if you don't experience that

1605
02:02:36.76 --> 02:02:42.60
and you don't build up the muscle of making a decision owning the outcome whether it's good or bad

1606
02:02:42.60 --> 02:02:49.96
only outcome you can build up a muscle memory for doing that where it becomes habitual and it's okay

1607
02:02:49.96 --> 02:02:56.12
and I think if you never if you never step into that arena you're you're just scared of it you know

1608
02:02:56.12 --> 02:03:00.76
it's like Mikey in the dragons all the kids book I wrote the the the the the kids scared of the

1609
02:03:00.76 --> 02:03:05.32
dragons you didn't realize the dragons are small and that's true with most things we fear so if you

1610
02:03:05.32 --> 02:03:11.000
don't open that door going that cave and make a decision occasionally you're never going to understand

1611
02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:17.32
that there's a once you do that if it was a bad decision just own it make adjustments and move forward

1612
02:03:17.32 --> 02:03:22.20
you need to learn that you need to feel that and you can get used to it yeah and you know

1613
02:03:22.20 --> 02:03:27.72
jocca I was listening to an interview you were participating in once and I think you said something to

1614
02:03:27.72 --> 02:03:34.68
affect that every every problem is a leadership problem and and you know with that gets to is

1615
02:03:34.68 --> 02:03:40.60
you know leaders have to create an environment where subordinates feel comfortable taking the risk to

1616
02:03:40.60 --> 02:03:44.76
make a decision and no hey if it doesn't turn out exactly right at least you know I'm not going to

1617
02:03:44.76 --> 02:03:50.68
get my legs chopped out from underneath me so you know it's really important that you know if you

1618
02:03:50.68 --> 02:03:57.16
if you're a leader and and you see that you've got subordinates who are hesitant to make a decision

1619
02:03:57.16 --> 02:04:01.24
maybe you should look in the mirror and think to yourself hey what am I doing to create an

1620
02:04:01.24 --> 02:04:06.68
environment where these these people are afraid to even even decide or make a mistake that that's

1621
02:04:06.68 --> 02:04:10.76
not a good environment a horrible environment and you're going to end up uh your team is going to fail

1622
02:04:10.76 --> 02:04:19.96
eventually yeah um fast forward a little bit chapter 25 iron sharpens iron as iron sharpens iron so

1623
02:04:19.96 --> 02:04:28.68
one person sharpens another proverbs 27 17 and this is right in line with what you were just talking

1624
02:04:28.68 --> 02:04:34.60
about demonstrate initiative and attribute I felt strongly about was initiative at every level of

1625
02:04:34.60 --> 02:04:39.72
leadership throughout the division and this is again this is when you were in a you know leadership

1626
02:04:39.72 --> 02:04:44.28
position this was a result of my combat experience in Romadi Iraq I saw during my time in

1627
02:04:44.28 --> 02:04:50.20
Romadi how it was essential that junior leaders demonstrated initiative in order to get ahead

1628
02:04:50.20 --> 02:04:56.84
of the decision making loop of our enemies I believed if we did not encourage initiative in steady

1629
02:04:56.84 --> 02:05:01.48
state operations at training exercise subordinate leaders would not display the necessary level

1630
02:05:01.48 --> 02:05:06.84
of initiative when in combat I put out written guidance and I continually reinforced stating I believe

1631
02:05:06.84 --> 02:05:13.80
demonstrating high levels of initiative was worth the risk of making honest mistakes so this is

1632
02:05:13.80 --> 02:05:19.72
exactly what you were just talking about if you've got a team that's not making decisions you're you're

1633
02:05:19.72 --> 02:05:26.04
you're the problem and the way you the way you instilled that culture inside your division when you

1634
02:05:26.04 --> 02:05:31.56
were division commander was by talking about it by putting out written guidance by demonstrating it

1635
02:05:31.56 --> 02:05:39.000
and I like this this point of the fact that initiative is worth the risk of making honest

1636
02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:44.36
mistakes that's a huge deal if you're a subordinate leader and you know that the boss wants you

1637
02:05:44.36 --> 02:05:50.52
to take initiative and that it is worth the risk of making honest mistakes that's that could be a

1638
02:05:50.52 --> 02:05:56.04
game changer for a young leader yeah you know I think that's an important statement uh there

1639
02:05:56.04 --> 02:06:01.24
about you know demonstrating initiative is worth the risk of making honest mistakes but

1640
02:06:01.24 --> 02:06:06.68
the caveat to that is if you're a leader and you put that statement out there guess what your

1641
02:06:06.68 --> 02:06:11.16
subordinates are going to be looking for they're going to be looking for the first time

1642
02:06:11.16 --> 02:06:14.52
somebody demonstrates initiative and makes it honest mistake and they're going to they're going to

1643
02:06:14.52 --> 02:06:19.80
they're going to be a martiala yeah they're going to be a watch it see how how do you react to this thing

1644
02:06:19.80 --> 02:06:25.16
and actually I think it was my sergeant major you know Chris Kepner who mentioned that to me

1645
02:06:25.16 --> 02:06:29.32
after I put that statement he oh he goes you know people are going to be watching to see

1646
02:06:29.32 --> 02:06:33.48
are you react the first time somebody makes an honest mistake by demonstrating initiative

1647
02:06:33.48 --> 02:06:39.32
and that was a little you know some good counsel from him so again leaders again to

1648
02:06:40.04 --> 02:06:43.88
to develop and cultivate this trust and organization they put something out there

1649
02:06:44.60 --> 02:06:51.80
now they really have to pay attention to make sure that they you know they they walk that the

1650
02:06:51.80 --> 02:06:55.64
talk there and and and and do what they said they're going to do because people are going to be

1651
02:06:55.64 --> 02:07:00.28
watching nobody's going to be leaving nobody's going to believe that written word until they

1652
02:07:00.28 --> 02:07:10.04
actually see an action fast forward here you've talking about some of the internal attributes

1653
02:07:10.68 --> 02:07:14.60
says if leaders cannot get in touch with their own feelings they will have difficulty

1654
02:07:14.60 --> 02:07:19.56
understanding the feelings of others leaders must practice self awareness and mindfulness

1655
02:07:19.56 --> 02:07:25.000
once one develops self-worth and you talk about I'm I'm fast forward a little bit you talk about

1656
02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.80
journaling is a good technique like writing down what your thoughts what your feelings are

1657
02:07:29.80 --> 02:07:34.44
so that you get some perspective on them I'm going to fast forward a little bit um once one

1658
02:07:34.44 --> 02:07:40.52
develop self awareness one can then become better at controlling emotions followers look to

1659
02:07:40.52 --> 02:07:46.68
leaders to be able to get things get stable when things get chaotic controlling ones emotions

1660
02:07:46.68 --> 02:07:52.52
has many personal organizational and societal benefits I remember when I was young I was a young

1661
02:07:52.52 --> 02:07:58.20
inexperienced leader I acted out in front of a group of my followers showing great displeasure

1662
02:07:58.20 --> 02:08:02.68
not with them but with a situation we were dealing with I ran to didn't rave and threw my

1663
02:08:02.68 --> 02:08:07.96
notebook across the room as an inexperienced leader I thought this would demonstrate to my followers

1664
02:08:07.96 --> 02:08:13.64
followers I was all in instead when I saw the negative reaction of my followers I realized this was

1665
02:08:13.64 --> 02:08:19.56
a poor technique you remember what happened what made you so mad yeah it was actually I was

1666
02:08:19.56 --> 02:08:27.16
a lieutenant on active duty commanding a platoon and I can't remember the actual incident that made

1667
02:08:27.16 --> 02:08:34.60
me upset but it was something that was upsetting to our to our unit don't put you in god

1668
02:08:34.60 --> 02:08:38.36
weekend duty or something like that something you know and I thought okay I'm going to show

1669
02:08:38.36 --> 02:08:45.40
my I really you know care care about this and acted out and I realized that they were they were

1670
02:08:45.40 --> 02:08:51.32
not looking for a leader to act like that they were looking for a leader to act professional more

1671
02:08:51.32 --> 02:08:58.52
stable and and I think I might either wrote in that book or somewhere else that they were looking

1672
02:08:58.52 --> 02:09:05.40
for a rock instead of what they got was a pile of sand you know and you know that that really taught

1673
02:09:05.40 --> 02:09:11.56
me that you know it's it's kind of like being a parent you know kids aren't looking for friends

1674
02:09:11.56 --> 02:09:16.60
they're looking for parents you know and and supportants aren't looking for for buddies they're

1675
02:09:16.60 --> 02:09:22.12
looking for followers that think of count on and it'd be be a father and the other thing is I

1676
02:09:22.12 --> 02:09:28.68
like to say is that leaders don't need to be great all the time but they need to be great

1677
02:09:28.68 --> 02:09:32.76
when it makes a difference they need to be great when it matters you know because you know let's

1678
02:09:32.76 --> 02:09:38.52
face it you know steady state operations 80% of the time think 90% of the time things are kind

1679
02:09:38.52 --> 02:09:43.64
of moving along right you know but then you hit this bump into road and that's where you really

1680
02:09:43.64 --> 02:09:49.40
got to stand up and you got to be a leader and you've got to show that that ability to control

1681
02:09:49.40 --> 02:09:56.44
your emotions and to be stable because that that that is something that creates confidence and

1682
02:09:56.44 --> 02:10:04.12
organization a full leader falls apart like that then then heck this ordinance don't have anybody

1683
02:10:04.12 --> 02:10:08.60
to count on because even the leaders start to crumble that that's not a good thing so that happened

1684
02:10:08.60 --> 02:10:13.56
on early on that happened early on in my career and I realized what a mistake that was so I was always

1685
02:10:13.56 --> 02:10:21.24
very very cognizant of the fact that hey yeah yeah you had a you had a show strength when things were

1686
02:10:21.24 --> 02:10:25.56
kind of caving in all around you that's that's what that's where your sports are expecting

1687
02:10:25.56 --> 02:10:30.84
I always looked at it if my leader couldn't control his emotions how the heck is it going to be

1688
02:10:30.84 --> 02:10:35.80
able to make good decisions and I was remembered I saw when I was younger some of the leaders I had

1689
02:10:35.80 --> 02:10:40.52
would fly off the handle and I just think well I was just gonna make good decisions no one makes a

1690
02:10:40.52 --> 02:10:47.48
good decision when they're emotional no displaying empathy empathy is an essential element of being a

1691
02:10:47.48 --> 02:10:52.28
servant leader empathetic leaders can sense what their followers are feeling this eliminates tone

1692
02:10:52.28 --> 02:10:58.04
deafness and the perception leaders do not understand or worse yet the perception the leader does not

1693
02:10:58.04 --> 02:11:03.16
care when followers think a leader does not care they will stop bringing forth their problems and

1694
02:11:03.16 --> 02:11:09.24
issues empathy is the capacity to show followers you care about them a leader must understand how

1695
02:11:09.24 --> 02:11:14.84
followers feel and what their issues are in order to provide their resources allowing followers to

1696
02:11:14.84 --> 02:11:21.88
do their job more effectively and increase the probability of mission accomplishment you want to see

1697
02:11:21.88 --> 02:11:26.84
the perspective of the people on your team and you know I think it was Colin Powell who said

1698
02:11:26.84 --> 02:11:33.40
something to the effect that when when a soldier's stop bringing you their problems you've effectively

1699
02:11:33.40 --> 02:11:38.60
stopped being a leader and you know you could apply that to you know civilian sectors well

1700
02:11:38.60 --> 02:11:44.76
when you're the people who worked for you stop bringing you problems you you've really effectively

1701
02:11:44.76 --> 02:11:51.96
lost your ability to to lead them because you know folks are gonna stop bringing us their

1702
02:11:51.96 --> 02:11:59.000
problems when they figure either you can't do anything about it or you just don't care enough

1703
02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:06.28
to do anything about it and and and and that's just a terrible position for for a leader to be in

1704
02:12:08.52 --> 02:12:12.84
yeah you gotta you gotta maintain that connection as always a running joke whenever I'm in a

1705
02:12:12.84 --> 02:12:17.80
leadership position that no one ever tells me that they're tired that they don't want to work

1706
02:12:17.80 --> 02:12:22.52
more it just never happens right so I always have to make sure that I'm pulling that string a

1707
02:12:22.52 --> 02:12:28.12
little bit more than normal because no one wants to come and say hey jocke we've had enough we want

1708
02:12:28.12 --> 02:12:32.20
to do and don't want to do another operation we don't want to go we've been on the road to no

1709
02:12:32.20 --> 02:12:37.16
one ever wants to tell me that so I always have to make sure I'm digging a little bit deeper otherwise

1710
02:12:37.16 --> 02:12:44.76
they won't say a damn thing uh section three is resilience and I'm gonna read a little section here

1711
02:12:46.60 --> 02:12:51.80
our four up on our upper humvies launched themselves out of the gate of four operating base

1712
02:12:51.80 --> 02:12:55.88
Ramadi on a sun drenched Sunday morning in September 2005 the heat was stifling the

1713
02:12:55.88 --> 02:13:00.68
afraid is river running through our area added a high degree of humidity causing my eye protection

1714
02:13:00.68 --> 02:13:06.36
and messed up with sweat we were traveling around around along route Michigan toward observation post

1715
02:13:06.36 --> 02:13:13.16
hotel overlooking east Ramadi, O.P. hotel a suicide bomber attacked the observation post a few weeks

1716
02:13:13.16 --> 02:13:18.52
earlier but failed to dislodge the tenacious soldiers who operated out of there I wanted to check

1717
02:13:18.52 --> 02:13:24.12
on the soldiers and gauge their morale our vehicles made their way through the city through a

1718
02:13:24.12 --> 02:13:30.20
city struggling due to the violent insurgency there still as we made our way east toward east Ramadi

1719
02:13:30.20 --> 02:13:34.44
the streets were busy with vehicle and pedestrian traffic I was happy to have my brigade

1720
02:13:34.44 --> 02:13:39.40
chaplain riding along with me in the backseat of our vehicle and the army I've always been a big fan

1721
02:13:39.40 --> 02:13:44.92
of our chaplains these warriors of a higher power could bolster the spirit of soldiers anytime they

1722
02:13:44.92 --> 02:13:50.36
visited a unit the chaplain was also part of my personal staff and I valued their insight prior

1723
02:13:50.36 --> 02:13:56.68
to making the decision affecting the well well fair of soldiers after our visit to O.P. hotel we made

1724
02:13:56.68 --> 02:14:01.96
our back our way back through the center of the city the chaplain noticed the same thing eye

1725
02:14:01.96 --> 02:14:08.44
into every soldier and our mounted patrol noticed the vehicles and pedestrians covering the streets

1726
02:14:08.44 --> 02:14:15.40
about two hours earlier had disappeared there was a strange quietness clothing the neighborhood

1727
02:14:15.40 --> 02:14:21.32
we were passing through we had seen this before we embraced ourselves for an insurgent attack

1728
02:14:22.36 --> 02:14:28.84
we all became a bit tense as our senses were alerted the banter we usually engaged in as we moved

1729
02:14:28.84 --> 02:14:34.76
about the city was quieted as we gave the alleys and buildings around us our full attention

1730
02:14:36.04 --> 02:14:42.68
in order to calm down our crew the chaplain announced an allowed voice fair not boys God is with us

1731
02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:50.04
the young specialist operating out of the gunners compartment of our vehicle heard the chaplains

1732
02:14:50.04 --> 02:14:55.48
announcement and from his more exposed position atop the vehicle he playfully called down to the

1733
02:14:55.48 --> 02:15:00.04
chaplain God maybe with you all down there but he certainly is not up here with me

1734
02:15:02.44 --> 02:15:08.44
about 20 seconds later we heard the boom of a rocket propelled grenade the grenade squarely hit the

1735
02:15:08.44 --> 02:15:14.68
armor shield surrounding our young gunner and harmlessly ricocheted into the air before

1736
02:15:14.68 --> 02:15:21.40
exploding and causing no harm to personnel and no damage to equipment our stunned gunner did not

1737
02:15:21.40 --> 02:15:27.88
miss a beat he quickly and loudly proclaimed I stand corrected chaplain God just arrived

1738
02:15:29.16 --> 02:15:34.44
of course we all broke up with laughter it was good having the chaplain with us that day

1739
02:15:34.44 --> 02:15:41.72
and this is a section that you've got called spiritual fitness talkers about spiritual fitness

1740
02:15:41.72 --> 02:15:47.32
yeah you know you know when we talk about fitness of course you know we think of physical fitness

1741
02:15:47.32 --> 02:15:53.24
and you know mental fitness emotional fitness but I think spiritual fitness is a big part of helping

1742
02:15:53.24 --> 02:16:02.28
us develop our leadership strength and that's whether we are part of some type of formal

1743
02:16:02.28 --> 02:16:10.68
you know religion or whether we just are connected to our spirituality in another way you know

1744
02:16:10.68 --> 02:16:16.92
through nature through meditation whatever the case it's it's important that we understand

1745
02:16:16.92 --> 02:16:22.28
that there's something I this my own person I believe there's something large we're going on

1746
02:16:22.28 --> 02:16:27.48
and universal round this it's not all about us you know we're just just just just a speck

1747
02:16:27.48 --> 02:16:32.68
of everything that's going on and I think that helps us keep grounded I think it keeps it helps us

1748
02:16:32.68 --> 02:16:39.80
keep humble and and I think it again kind of aligns with whatever values we say or a personal

1749
02:16:39.80 --> 02:16:48.04
values where it will help us stay on the right track as as we're making these these decisions so

1750
02:16:48.04 --> 02:16:56.84
I think if if leaders don't take the time to reflect on the the notion that there's a higher

1751
02:16:56.84 --> 02:17:00.92
power out there that there's something going on that's really much bigger than ourselves

1752
02:17:02.12 --> 02:17:08.36
that they may be missing something and this that that's one part of this whole section of the book

1753
02:17:08.36 --> 02:17:13.64
which is called Brazilians and this is one of your three overall themes and you got some other

1754
02:17:13.64 --> 02:17:21.16
facets of resilience in here positive energy and that's an overused statement right and

1755
02:17:21.16 --> 02:17:26.44
what I was thinking about when I was reading this is you can think of the positive energy as someone

1756
02:17:26.44 --> 02:17:31.64
that's sort of like it's it's hard to understand or it can be hard to understand but if you think

1757
02:17:31.64 --> 02:17:35.24
of people that have negative energy it's really easy to understand those people right it's really

1758
02:17:35.24 --> 02:17:39.24
easy to understand those all this is never going to work all we're screwed all this is horrible

1759
02:17:39.24 --> 02:17:44.36
you we all know people like that and it seems easier to identify maybe I shouldn't use the

1760
02:17:44.36 --> 02:17:49.64
word hard to understand it can be hard to understand hard to identify someone that has positive energy

1761
02:17:49.64 --> 02:17:55.000
it's really easy to there's more people it seems that have negative energy and occasionally

1762
02:17:55.000 --> 02:18:00.20
it gets someone that's just got super positive and and then you'll remember that and you'll remember

1763
02:18:00.20 --> 02:18:04.52
how they're you know what their response was when something was going wrong and how they

1764
02:18:04.52 --> 02:18:08.60
took it and they look around back oh good we get another chance to go at this or whatever the

1765
02:18:08.60 --> 02:18:13.40
case maybe so I think that's that's a good one you got fitness physical fitness in here

1766
02:18:13.40 --> 02:18:20.20
which is again something that I get off and asked does that come from the military or is that just

1767
02:18:20.20 --> 02:18:24.12
part of you and the answer is look there's plenty of people in the military that get out of the

1768
02:18:24.12 --> 02:18:29.64
military and physical fitness their physical fitness fails yeah they get out of shape so it's not

1769
02:18:29.64 --> 02:18:35.72
something that you get it's not a chip you get programmed you need to work at yeah and just

1770
02:18:35.72 --> 02:18:41.24
going back to your your piece they're about the positive energy you know you mentioned those

1771
02:18:41.24 --> 02:18:46.04
negative people I like to call them energy sponges because they just kind of sap the energy from

1772
02:18:46.04 --> 02:18:51.56
everyone around them it's kind of like why do I want to be around this person man you know and

1773
02:18:51.56 --> 02:19:00.76
it's just not good for a leader to be that way I like to say a leader should brighten up the

1774
02:19:00.76 --> 02:19:04.84
room when they enter it not when they leave it you know if you're to type a leader the bright

1775
02:19:04.84 --> 02:19:09.64
and zipper room when you leave it's kind of like man you're doing you're doing something wrong

1776
02:19:09.64 --> 02:19:15.96
there so again it's not like you got to be you know all smiling and slapping people on the back

1777
02:19:15.96 --> 02:19:22.20
and glad hand and people all the time but but people have to know that you're expecting tomorrow

1778
02:19:22.20 --> 02:19:27.80
to be a better day than today and who doesn't want to be around a leader who believes that tomorrow

1779
02:19:27.80 --> 02:19:32.20
is going to be better than today you know because you know we want to move forward and and that

1780
02:19:32.20 --> 02:19:38.04
that's what I mean by by positive energy and like we talked about earlier in the podcast here

1781
02:19:39.48 --> 02:19:45.24
you have to have an action plan a believable action plan you know if you want to be known as

1782
02:19:45.24 --> 02:19:50.60
as a as a positive leader because people aren't going to to follow you if they just think you're

1783
02:19:50.60 --> 02:19:54.84
glad handing everything and you really don't have a plan to back it up that's important yeah you

1784
02:19:54.84 --> 02:20:00.76
got to you got to see a pathway to get this mission done yeah and see a way to get out of this

1785
02:20:00.76 --> 02:20:05.56
miserable situation with that we're in and see a way to have some fun with it yeah yeah I mean

1786
02:20:05.56 --> 02:20:10.68
hey you know the two men nature people want to be able to you know have people want to be

1787
02:20:10.68 --> 02:20:16.68
able to enjoy their work you know and you know the old saying you know if you enjoy your work

1788
02:20:16.68 --> 02:20:21.32
you're not going to work a day in your life and I truly believe that and and again you just

1789
02:20:21.32 --> 02:20:26.36
got to find those things that really you know keep you motivated keep you excited about life

1790
02:20:26.36 --> 02:20:32.28
what about vulnerability this is another thing that you clue into here um well well well

1791
02:20:32.28 --> 02:20:37.40
talk to us about vulnerability from a leadership perspective yeah when I when I talk about vulnerability

1792
02:20:37.40 --> 02:20:42.84
uh and we are to talk a little bit about the first part it's about uh having the courage to

1793
02:20:42.84 --> 02:20:47.56
leave your comfort zone allowing yourself to be vulnerable to try something maybe you haven't

1794
02:20:47.56 --> 02:20:55.96
tried before something that's a little bit hard but the other um aspects of vulnerability is

1795
02:20:56.60 --> 02:21:02.52
putting yourself out there and exposing yourself to your followers and I'll tell you what I mean

1796
02:21:02.52 --> 02:21:08.60
by that one way to expose yourself to your followers and I I think this is a helpful technique is

1797
02:21:08.60 --> 02:21:15.08
sharing stories with your followers about times maybe when you tried something and you failed you

1798
02:21:15.08 --> 02:21:22.36
know or or you made a mistake and uh the reason I think that's important is because you know

1799
02:21:22.36 --> 02:21:27.56
followers look at at a leader the thing man they're in this position of leadership everything they

1800
02:21:27.56 --> 02:21:31.56
touch in life must you know must have turned a goal they probably never made any mistakes so they

1801
02:21:31.56 --> 02:21:36.52
want to be in this position of leadership and we know nothing could be farther from the truth so by

1802
02:21:37.16 --> 02:21:42.04
by explaining to your followers how hey you know I've I've tried and I've failed sometimes and

1803
02:21:42.04 --> 02:21:47.64
I've made mistakes and this is how is it able to overcome these mistakes that that inspires

1804
02:21:47.64 --> 02:21:53.72
uh those followers and then the the other piece about vulnerability is having the humility

1805
02:21:54.36 --> 02:21:59.56
to ask people on your team and I know you've written about this because I've read it but having

1806
02:21:59.56 --> 02:22:06.20
the humility to ask people on your team what they think and how they would do something and then

1807
02:22:07.32 --> 02:22:11.72
having the humility to follow through with their recommendation when you see it's a good

1808
02:22:11.72 --> 02:22:16.04
recommendation that should be followed and and again not just having that attitude that

1809
02:22:16.04 --> 02:22:21.08
hey I'm the leader you've only got two years on the job what could you possibly know you know

1810
02:22:21.08 --> 02:22:26.44
more than I I know but again you don't know what a life experience that person had so

1811
02:22:26.44 --> 02:22:31.56
asking people their opinion we talk about respect I think one of the best ways you could show

1812
02:22:31.56 --> 02:22:37.56
somebody on your team that you respect them is by asking their opinion could you imagine working

1813
02:22:37.56 --> 02:22:44.12
for somebody for ten years and you've never had that person you worked for ever ask you for your

1814
02:22:44.12 --> 02:22:51.40
opinion I mean you know how how could that make you feel good and and how could that make you

1815
02:22:51.40 --> 02:22:56.92
feel that that leader of yours respect you man you never even asked me what I thought you know

1816
02:22:56.92 --> 02:23:01.16
so I think one of the best ways to show people your respect them is a asset opinion doesn't mean

1817
02:23:01.16 --> 02:23:05.32
you have to follow the recommendation like we mentioned earlier and if you don't follow their

1818
02:23:05.32 --> 02:23:10.12
recommendation a good technique is getting back with them and explaining to them why but I think

1819
02:23:10.12 --> 02:23:14.04
to me that's what vulnerability is is all about those those couple of things there

1820
02:23:14.04 --> 02:23:21.48
yeah this is another negative example that I think is easier to see is if you're talking if you

1821
02:23:21.48 --> 02:23:25.80
work for me and you're talking and I cut you off right that's everyone knows that's disrespectful

1822
02:23:26.52 --> 02:23:31.24
well it's that also means that if I actually listen what you have to say that I'm being

1823
02:23:31.24 --> 02:23:35.24
respectful I'm giving you respect so that's it if you can't remember to listen to people

1824
02:23:35.24 --> 02:23:40.44
remember how rude it is when someone cuts you off and the opposite of that is to actually listen

1825
02:23:40.44 --> 02:23:47.64
to people here's another I think this is a a vulnerability that is so uncomfortable for leaders

1826
02:23:47.64 --> 02:23:53.64
and people and subordinates up and down the chain of command it's a vulnerability that is that is

1827
02:23:54.52 --> 02:24:03.48
people avoid almost at all costs and that is the ability to say I don't know yeah I don't

1828
02:24:03.48 --> 02:24:07.56
I don't know what do you think we should do is I don't know up and down the chain of command

1829
02:24:07.56 --> 02:24:14.12
I think the first place I learned this when when I got to the seal teams you didn't get your

1830
02:24:14.12 --> 02:24:20.52
you weren't a seal when you got to the seal teams you were a new guy an FNG as a matter of fact

1831
02:24:20.52 --> 02:24:25.48
so you get there your FNG you don't have your Trident which is the insignia that means you're a seal

1832
02:24:25.48 --> 02:24:29.16
and so you have to study for six months you're on a probationary board you have to

1833
02:24:30.04 --> 02:24:34.60
your own probation I should say and then you have to eventually go in front of a verbal board

1834
02:24:34.60 --> 02:24:38.76
and you go to the diving you go to the weapon you go to parachute you go to tactics you go to the

1835
02:24:38.76 --> 02:24:44.04
radius you and all these chiefs and master chiefs and senior chiefs and they're asking you questions

1836
02:24:44.04 --> 02:24:48.68
and what they tell you is and this is probably the first place I realized okay that's the

1837
02:24:48.68 --> 02:24:54.44
right thing to do if they ask you question and you don't know what you say is I don't know let me

1838
02:24:54.44 --> 02:24:59.000
do some research and I'll get back to you and that's the right answer and they're going to ask

1839
02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.88
you some quite they're going to dig so deep into those manuals they're going to get that answer

1840
02:25:01.88 --> 02:25:05.96
or you can sit there and say you can try and make up an answer you can try and pretend like you

1841
02:25:05.96 --> 02:25:09.56
know it and then you're going to get crushed because you lack the humility and you're not

1842
02:25:09.56 --> 02:25:14.20
being vulnerable enough to say hey I actually don't know so up and down the chain command just

1843
02:25:14.20 --> 02:25:19.80
like you said no one expects the leader to know everything as a leader we think everyone

1844
02:25:19.80 --> 02:25:24.20
expresses know everything and when we try and act like that we look like idiots yeah you don't

1845
02:25:24.20 --> 02:25:30.44
know everything just say hey I don't know what do you think it's perfectly fine three powerful

1846
02:25:30.44 --> 02:25:38.68
words that that leader should live by when when they don't know say it's skipping for it a

1847
02:25:38.68 --> 02:25:45.16
little bit remaining calm during the storm you you you talk about some ways to do this and you

1848
02:25:45.16 --> 02:25:49.08
got a couple points in here take control of the things you can I think this is something that

1849
02:25:49.08 --> 02:25:55.64
even though it's so obvious we still failed to do this people we worry about things we have no control

1850
02:25:55.64 --> 02:26:04.20
over so don't do that but you got another another section here do not catastrophize now did you

1851
02:26:04.20 --> 02:26:09.88
make up that word no that's actually a word I heard when I went through resiliency training okay

1852
02:26:09.88 --> 02:26:16.28
they they talked about the concept of catastrophize so here's the section on catastrophizing

1853
02:26:16.28 --> 02:26:21.40
the United States Army train soldiers on techniques that will help them display resiliency

1854
02:26:21.40 --> 02:26:26.60
one of those techniques which I think is particularly relevant during these uncertain times is

1855
02:26:26.60 --> 02:26:33.24
how to not catastrophize when you catastrophize you focus only on the worst case scenario you believe

1856
02:26:33.24 --> 02:26:37.80
the worst will happen and of course this produces a great deal of anxiety this can also so the

1857
02:26:37.80 --> 02:26:46.44
seeds of self-fulfilling prophecy it a method to place things in perspective and avoid catastrophizing

1858
02:26:46.44 --> 02:26:53.08
is by going through a practical thought process promoting resiliency and reducing anxiety first

1859
02:26:53.08 --> 02:26:57.56
look at what the worst case scenario would possibly look like second identify what the best case

1860
02:26:57.56 --> 02:27:03.000
scenario might be third consider the most likely or probable outcome then focus your attention on the

1861
02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:10.60
plan on the most probable case and develop your primary plan of action around that scenario so this is

1862
02:27:10.60 --> 02:27:16.04
something I think the reason I got a little bit focused on this is because this is what our news

1863
02:27:16.04 --> 02:27:21.000
media gets paid to do catastrophize everything everything is catastrophize everything is a

1864
02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:26.52
worst case scenario the world's gonna end if you follow the headlines the world ends every single day

1865
02:27:26.52 --> 02:27:32.44
it gets killed by COVID by war by this politician by that politician every single day there's a

1866
02:27:32.44 --> 02:27:39.16
catastrophe that happens and and if you do that as a leader you need your you're making a mistake

1867
02:27:39.16 --> 02:27:44.84
but but what's also important is you can't react to these things and someone runs into the

1868
02:27:44.84 --> 02:27:49.56
office with some massive problems like okay let's think through it okay I see you're excited awesome

1869
02:27:49.56 --> 02:27:56.04
let's think through it's astrophysing you know I'm surprised I woke up this morning you know

1870
02:27:56.04 --> 02:28:01.16
watching a news I thought the world ended yesterday but but yeah you're you're exactly

1871
02:28:01.16 --> 02:28:09.16
right and and I do try to use this technique because usually the very worst case doesn't

1872
02:28:09.16 --> 02:28:15.72
doesn't happen and and you get yourself all spun up about it all friggin tense and and stressed out

1873
02:28:15.72 --> 02:28:22.20
about and it's not going to do you any good anyway this is one of one of the most beautiful

1874
02:28:22.20 --> 02:28:29.24
things I learned in the military is the is the counter to the catastrophizing individual above

1875
02:28:29.24 --> 02:28:33.64
you and the chain of command below you and the chain of command appear whatever they're panicking

1876
02:28:33.64 --> 02:28:38.36
they're freaking out and what you learn in the military you learn this powerful word which is

1877
02:28:38.36 --> 02:28:43.40
Roger that or rather Roger that someone comes in they're going crazy oh you can't believe this

1878
02:28:43.40 --> 02:28:51.16
happened I've got Roger meaning okay understand let's let's think about it so anytime be very careful

1879
02:28:51.16 --> 02:28:57.16
as a leader be very careful with the words you choose to explain what's happening and and sometimes

1880
02:28:57.16 --> 02:29:03.32
as a leader we want to get a reaction out of people where we've got this situation happening and we

1881
02:29:03.32 --> 02:29:07.80
know it's critical and we need to make some adjustments and so in order to get people moving instead

1882
02:29:07.80 --> 02:29:12.44
of explaining to them what's happening and why we need to make a move we just go straight to level

1883
02:29:12.44 --> 02:29:20.12
12 catastrophize in order to get in order to get people to move we catastrophize and the problem

1884
02:29:20.12 --> 02:29:24.28
with that is it ends up being the little boy that cried wolf where you catastrophize everything

1885
02:29:24.28 --> 02:29:29.000
is a catastrophe everything is going to end the world everything is a strategic failure for the team

1886
02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:36.20
everything is a catastrophic event and it's like no in fact there are so few catastrophic events that

1887
02:29:36.20 --> 02:29:42.44
can actually happen that there's almost nothing that you can catastrophize with me you're going

1888
02:29:42.44 --> 02:29:46.12
to get through just about everything that's kind of like the whole thing if everything is a priority

1889
02:29:46.12 --> 02:29:51.48
nothing is a priority exactly you know you you really got to be clear about what the priorities are

1890
02:29:51.48 --> 02:29:57.56
and then get everybody working toward achieving those you know probably maybe two or three

1891
02:29:57.56 --> 02:30:03.000
priorities so things that are really important prioritize an execute I believe I believe that's the

1892
02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:12.28
word um I want to close out with one last section here um and it's it's how you close out the book but it's

1893
02:30:12.28 --> 02:30:18.52
it's a good indicator of everything else that's in the book so it says this I was raised by my

1894
02:30:18.52 --> 02:30:24.60
father that faith in God though we though my father faced setbacks such as losing his wife at an early age

1895
02:30:24.60 --> 02:30:30.52
and raising seven children after her death he never lost faith my father made it a point to

1896
02:30:30.52 --> 02:30:38.04
march us march all seven of his children into church every Sunday morning this made a lifelong

1897
02:30:38.04 --> 02:30:44.84
impression not only on me and my siblings but many others who resided in our community there are

1898
02:30:44.84 --> 02:30:49.08
certain things I learned about good leadership as a young boy from my father and others

1899
02:30:49.08 --> 02:30:54.20
that have been reinforced throughout my life the things I learned were the importance of having

1900
02:30:54.20 --> 02:31:00.28
strong character and staying true to your values even when things got tough being service oriented

1901
02:31:00.28 --> 02:31:06.20
and helping other people whenever you could regardless of their race religion and setting an

1902
02:31:06.20 --> 02:31:12.52
example by doing the right thing even when no one was watching I know I am not a perfect leader

1903
02:31:12.52 --> 02:31:17.64
but I continue to do my best to learn how I can become a better person and a better leader and I

1904
02:31:17.64 --> 02:31:25.56
encourage all who read this book to do the same seek to place the organization you lead in good hands

1905
02:31:29.80 --> 02:31:34.84
well I think that's what we're all trying to do we're all trying to do the same thing

1906
02:31:34.84 --> 02:31:40.52
continue to learn continue trying become better people and better leaders and definitely

1907
02:31:40.52 --> 02:31:44.92
appreciate you for writing this book and and given some of these lessons learned

1908
02:31:45.56 --> 02:31:54.68
no jacco I appreciate the the time to talk about it I appreciate the time to talk about the

1909
02:31:54.68 --> 02:32:00.12
book with you and just really grateful that we could spend a little bit of time you and I just

1910
02:32:00.12 --> 02:32:06.04
just talking about our own leadership philosophies and and what it means to continue to

1911
02:32:06.04 --> 02:32:11.08
learn and continue to grow to be a better leader so thank you for the opportunity yeah there's

1912
02:32:11.08 --> 02:32:15.80
I mean obviously we use some different verbages and some focus here and there might be a little

1913
02:32:15.80 --> 02:32:20.76
bit different but the underlying themes I mean these are these are what leadership these are

1914
02:32:20.76 --> 02:32:25.80
these are the underlying themes that exist in leadership anywhere you look anybody that understands it

1915
02:32:26.52 --> 02:32:33.96
is going to you're going to see these common themes so right now you've got a consulting company

1950
02:36:03.80 --> 02:36:12.20
has left the building so echo yes kind of close that out talking about how people we all want to be better

1951
02:36:12.20 --> 02:36:17.64
need to be better can be better let's see what do we start well we start with our health

1952
02:36:18.68 --> 02:36:24.52
without health we have nothing um straight up from what i understand you add a little disregard of your

1953
02:36:24.52 --> 02:36:31.48
health the other day and went to a McDonald's restaurant it was a eight food there was a momentary lapse of

1954
02:36:31.48 --> 02:36:41.000
judgment uh and discipline for sure but it's the it was what are you to break um opportunistic and this

1955
02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:47.40
is the kind of stuff we got to be careful for or about or whatever you know how you have a routine

1956
02:36:48.12 --> 02:36:53.80
and everyone's all get reminded of the importance of a routine okay i'm not a I don't 100% sign

1957
02:36:53.80 --> 02:36:55.80
on to the whole routine is McDonald's party

1958
02:36:57.16 --> 02:37:01.16
make no well it's an example if you don't have a routine what it does is

1959
02:37:01.16 --> 02:37:12.04
really a lot of your tools and you know what it's like okay you don't you don't have a

1960
02:37:12.04 --> 02:37:19.72
opportunity to do that doesn't matter okay i bought i got the the item that is a soft soft

1961
02:37:19.72 --> 02:37:28.28
bun and inside that bun is a fish flavored concoction you got the fish fillet yeah yeah i don't think

1962
02:37:28.28 --> 02:37:34.44
that's there's real fish in there at all but either way you think there's like a crayfish or something

1963
02:37:34.44 --> 02:37:38.04
there's something in there no you know what it is it's like one of those you just pierce sugar

1964
02:37:38.04 --> 02:37:42.92
yeah it's like a synthetic they they do a sit there i don't know but this is what it feels like

1965
02:37:42.92 --> 02:37:47.96
maybe like a synthetic um material that's made maybe you know like a 3D printer or something

1966
02:37:47.96 --> 02:37:54.52
like this with like some some stuff and then they put like some fish like extract flavor in it

1967
02:37:54.52 --> 02:37:59.72
and then fry it okay was that the path that the path it's making you better okay if you're on

1968
02:37:59.72 --> 02:38:04.04
it okay okay the path is kind of a routine it essentially is and this is important as

1969
02:38:04.04 --> 02:38:09.72
with a routine where if you have a routine there's way way way less opportunity to make to have like

1970
02:38:09.72 --> 02:38:15.80
oh like a decision making conundrum right because the routine the decision you have already made before

1971
02:38:15.80 --> 02:38:20.36
part of the routine while you're not angry hang on through emotional departure

1972
02:38:20.36 --> 02:38:24.68
exactly the question because you haven't had a freaking fish save a few hours

1973
02:38:24.68 --> 02:38:29.64
either way if you're angry even you already know because dinner's soon or you know when

1974
02:38:29.64 --> 02:38:33.64
the dinner is seem saying if you have a routine or lunch or but we'll back with whatever you're

1975
02:38:33.64 --> 02:38:38.68
about to eat whatever you're almost almost all right take you off the path here's

1976
02:38:38.68 --> 02:38:43.32
the here's what Ronald does he he just waits he waits for the people with no routine

1977
02:38:43.32 --> 02:38:49.32
or an or he'll slide into your routine but a lot of times for people like me in this case where

1978
02:38:50.52 --> 02:38:55.80
the little the little crack in the routine he's right there he's like hey you need a decision to

1979
02:38:55.80 --> 02:38:59.64
make I'll make it easy for you what's the one that's gonna give you the pal the quickest

1980
02:38:59.64 --> 02:39:04.36
he seems saying to us what it was instead of going home to dinner my wife was somewhere else

1981
02:39:04.36 --> 02:39:09.08
and she was like hey you know like you know I don't know how much food there's gonna be here or

1982
02:39:09.08 --> 02:39:14.44
whatever so you know grab something this was like cool I made the turn in like literally on my way home

1983
02:39:14.44 --> 02:39:22.28
change trajectory looking to the exit and boom McDonald's is right there made it happen

1984
02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:28.60
in a bad way all right so we don't want to consume things that are our home no what do we want

1985
02:39:28.60 --> 02:39:32.44
to go to the point is health health is a thing with with no health look if I'm gonna make

1986
02:39:32.44 --> 02:39:37.16
Donald every single day my health goes downtown and then eventually I become incapable

1987
02:39:37.16 --> 02:39:43.56
of pretty much anything so if you're unhealthy or your health is in decline or whatever by your

1988
02:39:43.56 --> 02:39:49.16
own meanwhile you have if you have control over it and you choose to not be healthy you can have

1989
02:39:49.16 --> 02:39:54.28
some problems okay so let's choose to be healthy that's what I think like it so on this path

1990
02:39:54.28 --> 02:40:01.56
starts with health fitness capability mental and physical now with that we can have a little

1991
02:40:01.56 --> 02:40:08.36
helper some away that helper is jockel fuel so I'm actually working on a video

1992
02:40:10.44 --> 02:40:17.72
jockel fuel video cool just a small one about why you jockel started jockel fuel interesting

1993
02:40:18.44 --> 02:40:22.36
it actually doesn't go very deep when you think about it's like just stuff that you're using anyway

1994
02:40:22.36 --> 02:40:27.64
that's one of the worst hype you know things I've ever heard like I'm so not hype for this video right

1995
02:40:27.64 --> 02:40:31.88
now yeah but here's the only reason I'm a little bit hyped is I know you wouldn't bring it up

1996
02:40:31.88 --> 02:40:37.88
unless you're hyped so you must have some vision about some explosions that are gonna happen

1997
02:40:37.88 --> 02:40:42.28
uh yeah you know potentially I mean maybe I have explosions either where the point is though the

1998
02:40:42.28 --> 02:40:50.28
point is the reason jockel started jockel fuel is stuff that you use anyway so you figure okay

1999
02:40:50.28 --> 02:40:56.68
let me just refine and maximize the quality on these things that I use anyway produce some

2000
02:40:56.68 --> 02:41:01.72
boom and then we'll have that product there you go one of the many little helpers in life

2001
02:41:01.72 --> 02:41:07.48
helpers on the path because let's face it you're it's late you dinner chains dinner plans change

2002
02:41:07.48 --> 02:41:13.56
your hungry you could you could easily go to McDonald's like echo Charles did which is

2003
02:41:13.56 --> 02:41:17.72
taking him in the wrong direction off the path unhealthy feeling sick later

2004
02:41:18.44 --> 02:41:23.16
not doing a good work out the next day just everything is turning bad or you could power and

2005
02:41:23.16 --> 02:41:30.44
be like oh go I got mock at home you know I got mock at home very high to save your yeah it is

2006
02:41:30.44 --> 02:41:35.32
true and and all you've been explained it's to say how much of a savior it is so look okay so

2007
02:41:35.32 --> 02:41:40.28
energy drinks right you don't know that we're satan to get there in a sleep or dang I have a huge

2008
02:41:40.28 --> 02:41:45.08
workload today and tomorrow maybe I'm need a little booster maybe I'm just used to a little

2009
02:41:45.08 --> 02:41:49.56
boost at some point in the day right but usually we've got a pair of price either we crash or

2010
02:41:49.56 --> 02:41:55.24
either we're drinking something that's unhealthy boom these energy drinks go jocco discipline go

2011
02:41:55.24 --> 02:41:59.48
may or may not be called discipline anymore let's call this one go all right there you go boom jocco

2012
02:41:59.48 --> 02:42:08.68
discipline go is an energy drink with front side and back side benefits and no downside no downside

2013
02:42:08.68 --> 02:42:14.44
kind of went off on that recently we're talking just the just the no downside piece yeah most things

2014
02:42:14.44 --> 02:42:20.36
that are as gratifying and have so much upside usually I was always a little downside right no downside

2015
02:42:20.36 --> 02:42:24.68
not this time boom little helper on that path I mean you're on the path you're still on the path

2016
02:42:24.68 --> 02:42:30.12
little in fact you're even more down the path yeah you're going to good with told me positive

2017
02:42:30.12 --> 02:42:34.84
cross the board so boom or you get home let's face it everyone's in a while you need dinner you

2018
02:42:34.84 --> 02:42:40.36
had a good day you had a good week great week spent time with the family got your work done you know

2019
02:42:40.36 --> 02:42:46.52
you're you're you moved ahead you just want a little celebratory dessert I don't think like this even

2020
02:42:46.52 --> 02:42:55.000
there weird thing is even after you have a 26 ounce rib eye steak yeah that's a and it's maybe

2021
02:42:55.000 --> 02:43:01.72

2078
02:48:33.24 --> 02:48:38.28
AO area of operations look if people get crazy with this whole platform the platforms and

2079
02:48:38.28 --> 02:48:42.44
there's a bunch of them you figure hey well you know you got this platform in that platform one of the

2080
02:48:42.44 --> 02:48:49.16
chances that they all decide to either start inserting ads or start making people pay or whatever

2081
02:48:49.16 --> 02:48:55.48
they're gonna do I don't know but if it happens we have our own little I don't know the world carved out

at jocco underground.com we appreciate the sport and we also have a YouTube channel

2089
02:49:38.12 --> 02:49:45.64
it speaking of platforms true where we put up videos so far you do flip pretty straightforward

2090
02:49:45.64 --> 02:49:49.96
for the platform you know video we've got demonetized a couple times yeah we've had

2091
02:49:49.96 --> 02:49:56.04
warnings only a couple times like what is the the warning of info yeah and keep it

2092
02:49:56.04 --> 02:49:59.80
when you see demonetized because this is different there's different levels of demonetization

2093
02:49:59.80 --> 02:50:05.000
you can get a video demonetized you can get the or the whole channel straight up demonetized

2094
02:50:06.12 --> 02:50:10.92
or this somewhere in between where it's like okay you can proclaim that hey this video contains

2095
02:50:10.92 --> 02:50:17.96
some heavy stuff bro I had one Halloween I did like a quick video of working out or whatever

2096
02:50:17.96 --> 02:50:24.20
something and I put in the background Halloween the song by the miss fits oh yeah and

2097
02:50:25.48 --> 02:50:32.52
we almost instantly it was whatever blocked band and whatever else because it was copyright material

2098
02:50:32.52 --> 02:50:35.88
I was like you know spreading the word on the miss fits like you know what I mean yeah

2099
02:50:35.88 --> 02:50:40.68
it's true but they were on that yeah and you know they did they they kind of consider both sides

2100
02:50:40.68 --> 02:50:46.68
I think anyway because it's like hey what if um they assume that you're making money off of your

2101
02:50:46.68 --> 02:50:51.80
your your probably is a post you're video there's a post oh not on YouTube it was on something else

2102
02:50:51.80 --> 02:50:57.08
it was on the gram oh yeah yeah that's different sweared they came at me well you know what

2103
02:50:57.08 --> 02:51:03.72
what it is it's my hypothesis I think Danzig and the miss fits highly protected there

2104
02:51:05.08 --> 02:51:09.88
I put it IP yeah because you're essentially acting as a distributor

2105
02:51:10.92 --> 02:51:14.92
essentially I mean all I meant to do is actually spread the word hey man this is a great band

2106
02:51:14.92 --> 02:51:20.36
the miss fits bro this is iconic band yes iconic it's true but the rules got to kind of

2107
02:51:20.36 --> 02:51:26.28
apply to everybody you know so without some kind of approval a distributor process I saw the

2108
02:51:26.28 --> 02:51:33.80
miss fits recently with the crowman like before covid in LA in a big giant stadium and you know

2109
02:51:33.80 --> 02:51:39.88
what it was freaking outstanding I mean the crowman was awesome yes absolutely hardly was rocking

2110
02:51:39.88 --> 02:51:45.56
and then the miss fits came out and I was like this is I salute these guys they were honest

2111
02:51:45.56 --> 02:51:49.16
swayers playing the word and yeah I was trying to spread the word a little bit and like they thought

2112
02:51:49.16 --> 02:51:54.76
it was trying to jack their stuff well in their defense they didn't see your posts and and was like

2113
02:51:54.76 --> 02:51:59.72
hey jockel take that down I don't want you you know just dreaming myself it's not how it went down

2114
02:51:59.72 --> 02:52:05.40
but when some people be like hey can you put a clip out of our music so more people buy our music right

2115
02:52:05.40 --> 02:52:09.80
yeah that could happen right what wouldn't they think of it that way instead of the other way technically

2116
02:52:09.80 --> 02:52:14.92
the miss fits didn't do it directly technically instagram did it miss fits probably signed up

2117
02:52:14.92 --> 02:52:20.44
signed that song up to be monitored or whatever automatically so without them checking back with

2118
02:52:20.44 --> 02:52:29.16
you specifically or over to Glenn Danzig and the miss fits I was not doing it nefariously I was

2119
02:52:29.16 --> 02:52:33.96
actually doing a promotional way if you're going to license your songs to me yeah I'll throw them

2120
02:52:33.96 --> 02:52:39.16
out there into the world you can you probably never even heard a miss fits song which is kind of

2121
02:52:39.16 --> 02:52:44.36
sad no I've never I don't think I've heard a miss fits song but I heard you talk about the

2122
02:52:44.36 --> 02:52:48.68
miss you right so kind of the same but that if you heard a miss fits song you'd probably

2123
02:52:48.68 --> 02:52:56.36
like pretty good yeah oh yeah it's it's iconic music to be honest with you it's iconic music

2124
02:52:56.36 --> 02:53:04.28
is iconic an opinion or a factual standard factual so you can have the miss fits what's

2125
02:53:04.28 --> 02:53:09.88
called the white list they can white list your channel actually this is on youtube I know you

2126
02:53:09.88 --> 02:53:14.60
can do this on youtube because this is a nice day it's called jocals jocals down they can whatever

2127
02:53:14.60 --> 02:53:20.84
the he posts all good as far as our account goes if they do that with us I won't abuse it I'm not going

2128
02:53:20.84 --> 02:53:25.40
to make like the you know what I mean this is only on youtube right on youtube but maybe we'll do it on

2129
02:53:25.40 --> 02:53:31.48
instagram yeah just apply the youtube rule fits again I should tell it next time especially

2130
02:53:31.48 --> 02:53:37.16
how long it takes him to shut me down I did some other older hardcore bands and that

2131
02:53:37.16 --> 02:53:42.28
that just wore around for a short period of time no one ever said anything so I think it depends

2132
02:53:42.28 --> 02:53:47.72
on the band yeah they have there you have to register your your songs and stuff like even on

2133
02:53:47.72 --> 02:53:55.08
youtube like if if I use a I don't know your other favorite band like if I use like Taylor Swift or something

2134
02:53:55.08 --> 02:53:59.88
like this right you know that all Taylor Swift songs have been registered with youtube

2135
02:54:01.08 --> 02:54:07.000
through some process that's like hey this little thing this little print imprint or whatever the

2136
02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:12.76
how are they monitor it turns up automatic either and they choose whether it shut down

2137
02:54:12.76 --> 02:54:19.08
um blocked or um just silent something some videos would just be silent because like hey that

2138
02:54:19.08 --> 02:54:26.36
audio is not not cool or they'll just take the monetization did they demonetize my guitar playing

2139
02:54:27.72 --> 02:54:32.76
when I play that song by the way Buffalo no interesting not yours but when he was on

2140
02:54:32.76 --> 02:54:38.36
