00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.36
This is Jocko podcast number 349 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:04.36 --> 00:00:05.20
Jocko willing.

3
00:00:05.20 --> 00:00:06.04
Good evening Echo.

4
00:00:06.04 --> 00:00:06.88
Good evening.

5
00:00:08.16 --> 00:00:13.16
Powerful enemies must be out fought and out produced.

6
00:00:14.60 --> 00:00:18.000
It is not enough to just turn out a few more planes,

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.36
a few more tanks, a few more guns, a few more ships

8
00:00:21.36 --> 00:00:24.12
that can be turned out by our enemies.

9
00:00:24.12 --> 00:00:28.16
We must out produce them overwhelmingly

10
00:00:28.16 --> 00:00:31.48
so that there can be no question of our ability

11
00:00:31.48 --> 00:00:35.32
to provide a crushing superiority of equipment

12
00:00:35.32 --> 00:00:38.000
in any theater of the world war.

13
00:00:40.88 --> 00:00:44.68
And that right there is what President Roosevelt

14
00:00:44.68 --> 00:00:48.24
told Congress and America less than a month

15
00:00:48.24 --> 00:00:49.88
after the attack on Pearl Harbor

16
00:00:51.48 --> 00:00:54.84
and what he talked about doing, we did.

17
00:00:54.84 --> 00:00:56.84
In the United States,

18
00:00:56.84 --> 00:01:01.84
America provided almost 70% of the military equipment

19
00:01:03.60 --> 00:01:05.24
for the allies in World War II.

20
00:01:05.24 --> 00:01:10.24
297,000 aircraft, 193,000 artillery guns,

21
00:01:11.72 --> 00:01:15.52
86,000 tanks, 2 million trucks,

22
00:01:15.52 --> 00:01:20.52
2.6 million submachine guns, almost 12 million rifles.

23
00:01:20.52 --> 00:01:25.52
The US Navy grew from 700 ships to almost 7,000

24
00:01:30.70 --> 00:01:33.18
and that included 23 battleships

25
00:01:33.18 --> 00:01:37.14
and 151 aircraft carriers.

26
00:01:39.70 --> 00:01:44.62
And that crushing superiority of production

27
00:01:45.78 --> 00:01:48.34
and the brave men who brought those weapons

28
00:01:48.34 --> 00:01:52.02
to bear against the enemy overwhelmed the Nazis

29
00:01:52.02 --> 00:01:54.52
and the Imperial Japanese Army.

30
00:01:54.52 --> 00:01:58.22
And America's ability to create and produce,

31
00:01:58.22 --> 00:02:00.42
to design and manufacture,

32
00:02:00.42 --> 00:02:05.42
this has always been one of our strongest assets as a nation,

33
00:02:08.14 --> 00:02:12.46
our working class, the men and women of this country

34
00:02:12.46 --> 00:02:14.82
that actually do these things,

35
00:02:14.82 --> 00:02:19.82
that actually make these things happen, but that asset

36
00:02:20.90 --> 00:02:25.90
and that capability, it faded, it faded.

37
00:02:27.22 --> 00:02:31.70
And manufacturing went overseas,

38
00:02:33.10 --> 00:02:34.70
we shut down a lot of our mills,

39
00:02:34.70 --> 00:02:36.06
we shut down a lot of our factories,

40
00:02:36.06 --> 00:02:40.06
we abandoned our communities, we abandoned our workforce,

41
00:02:40.94 --> 00:02:42.66
we abandoned the American worker

42
00:02:42.66 --> 00:02:47.66
and our rivals around the world, they smiled

43
00:02:51.58 --> 00:02:54.66
and they eased that transition for us.

44
00:02:54.66 --> 00:02:57.98
They helped us down that path, they offered cheap labor,

45
00:02:59.90 --> 00:03:04.22
basically slave labor, they didn't care about worker safety,

46
00:03:04.22 --> 00:03:06.10
they didn't care about the environmental impact

47
00:03:06.10 --> 00:03:08.94
of what they were doing, but they were able to,

48
00:03:08.94 --> 00:03:13.94
they were able to win on price, but we paid the price.

49
00:03:19.30 --> 00:03:24.30
And we began to lose that incredibly valuable asset

50
00:03:25.46 --> 00:03:27.42
in our country, our ability to make things,

51
00:03:27.42 --> 00:03:28.62
our ability to build things,

52
00:03:28.62 --> 00:03:31.78
our ability to create and manufacture.

53
00:03:34.02 --> 00:03:36.10
And with the loss of that skill,

54
00:03:36.10 --> 00:03:39.86
with the loss of that asset,

55
00:03:39.86 --> 00:03:44.78
our strength in the world began to diminish,

56
00:03:46.70 --> 00:03:51.70
began to fade, but there's a new fire burning now

57
00:03:54.06 --> 00:03:58.82
and there's a slow burning revolution occurring.

58
00:03:59.90 --> 00:04:03.50
There are companies in America that have had enough of that,

59
00:04:03.50 --> 00:04:07.62
that are capturing the skills from the past,

60
00:04:07.62 --> 00:04:09.26
that are teaching the right people,

61
00:04:09.26 --> 00:04:13.86
that are restoring the machines and resurrecting the factories.

62
00:04:15.58 --> 00:04:19.94
There are people and companies that are rebuilding America

63
00:04:19.94 --> 00:04:24.94
into the strong, powerful and benevolent nation it once was.

64
00:04:28.30 --> 00:04:32.74
And I am honored to be part of some of those companies

65
00:04:32.74 --> 00:04:35.86
with my business partner, P. Roberts.

66
00:04:35.86 --> 00:04:40.54
And we have, we've invested everything we've got

67
00:04:40.54 --> 00:04:43.70
into OriginUSA and into JockoFuel

68
00:04:43.70 --> 00:04:48.70
and we are doing our best in this new war.

69
00:04:51.66 --> 00:04:55.10
An economic war, yes, it's an economic war.

70
00:04:55.10 --> 00:04:59.10
It's also a war of ideas and it's a war of ideology

71
00:05:00.66 --> 00:05:02.70
when you look at who we're up against.

72
00:05:02.70 --> 00:05:07.54
It's a war of skill, it's a war of production,

73
00:05:07.54 --> 00:05:11.18
it's a war of efficiency and it's a war of grit.

74
00:05:13.66 --> 00:05:18.66
It's a war between state control and self-determination,

75
00:05:20.78 --> 00:05:24.34
a war between subjugation and liberty,

76
00:05:24.34 --> 00:05:28.66
between slavery and freedom.

77
00:05:28.66 --> 00:05:31.62
That's what's at stake.

78
00:05:34.06 --> 00:05:37.94
And that's not just rhetoric, that's what's going on.

79
00:05:37.94 --> 00:05:42.38
And it's great to have Pete back here with us tonight

80
00:05:42.38 --> 00:05:45.82
to talk about the war that we're fighting right now

81
00:05:45.82 --> 00:05:50.82
on all fronts as we try to help rebuild America.

82
00:05:51.62 --> 00:05:53.02
Pete, what's happening, man?

83
00:05:53.02 --> 00:05:54.90
Badass, man, powerful.

84
00:05:54.90 --> 00:05:56.46
Thanks for having me back on.

85
00:05:56.46 --> 00:05:59.10
Pete Roberts, if you don't know who he is, podcast 93,

86
00:05:59.10 --> 00:06:03.34
podcast 141, podcast 194, podcast 297.

87
00:06:03.34 --> 00:06:08.26
That's, we joined forces in 2017.

88
00:06:08.26 --> 00:06:10.58
We recorded a podcast every year up here

89
00:06:10.58 --> 00:06:14.50
at the origin main immersion Jiu Jitsu camp,

90
00:06:14.50 --> 00:06:16.98
which we, there's a little gap in 2020.

91
00:06:16.98 --> 00:06:18.22
We got shut down.

92
00:06:18.22 --> 00:06:19.82
We weren't allowed to do Jiu Jitsu.

93
00:06:19.82 --> 00:06:23.62
We weren't allowed to do Jiu Jitsu.

94
00:06:23.62 --> 00:06:26.06
At least not in public.

95
00:06:26.06 --> 00:06:26.90
Yeah, yeah.

96
00:06:26.90 --> 00:06:27.74
We kept training.

97
00:06:27.74 --> 00:06:28.94
I'm sure you kept training too.

98
00:06:30.18 --> 00:06:33.46
So this has turned out to be an annual thing

99
00:06:33.46 --> 00:06:36.54
that we're doing and it's a good opportunity for us

100
00:06:36.54 --> 00:06:38.62
to let people know what's going on,

101
00:06:38.62 --> 00:06:40.90
share people some of the experiences that we've had

102
00:06:40.90 --> 00:06:42.14
and some of the lessons that we've learned

103
00:06:42.14 --> 00:06:43.50
because we're learning.

104
00:06:43.50 --> 00:06:45.62
We're learning a lot of lessons along the way

105
00:06:45.62 --> 00:06:48.62
and giving everyone an update as to what's happening

106
00:06:48.62 --> 00:06:50.58
so that they can see sort of the big picture

107
00:06:50.58 --> 00:06:51.42
of what's going on.

108
00:06:51.42 --> 00:06:56.34
So essentially we're talking about two companies.

109
00:06:56.34 --> 00:06:59.42
And really these two companies,

110
00:07:00.42 --> 00:07:03.18
I would say it's safe to say that they started

111
00:07:04.62 --> 00:07:06.82
as sort of a Siamese twins, right?

112
00:07:06.82 --> 00:07:10.42
Like they were connected and, you know,

113
00:07:10.42 --> 00:07:12.18
they had a lot, they shared a lot of blood.

114
00:07:12.18 --> 00:07:14.34
Maybe, yeah, maybe shared, you know,

115
00:07:14.34 --> 00:07:16.06
like they have three lungs total.

116
00:07:16.06 --> 00:07:18.10
One of the lungs was shared.

117
00:07:18.10 --> 00:07:18.94
You have two of the lungs.

118
00:07:18.94 --> 00:07:19.98
Yeah.

119
00:07:19.98 --> 00:07:23.78
It's like, so there's these shared things going on.

120
00:07:23.78 --> 00:07:26.78
One of the Jocofuel, obviously it's our supplement

121
00:07:26.78 --> 00:07:28.78
nutrition brand and the other one's Origin USA,

122
00:07:28.78 --> 00:07:33.78
which is our hard goods, clothing, accessories brand.

123
00:07:34.54 --> 00:07:36.74
We got fitness products in there too as well.

124
00:07:36.74 --> 00:07:38.82
So a bunch of stuff, but we got these two companies.

125
00:07:38.82 --> 00:07:41.78
So let's talk about where we're at with these,

126
00:07:41.78 --> 00:07:44.10
what's going on, some of the lessons we learned,

127
00:07:44.10 --> 00:07:47.30
some of the tuition payments that we've made.

128
00:07:47.30 --> 00:07:49.66
You know, do you have your MBA?

129
00:07:49.66 --> 00:07:51.38
I don't have shit, I'm a college dropout.

130
00:07:51.38 --> 00:07:52.86
Okay, so you don't have your MBA,

131
00:07:52.86 --> 00:07:53.86
I don't have my MBA.

132
00:07:53.86 --> 00:07:54.98
Echo, you have your MBA?

133
00:07:54.98 --> 00:07:55.82
No MBA.

134
00:07:55.82 --> 00:07:58.02
But you know what, we've learned some business lessons.

135
00:07:58.02 --> 00:07:59.06
Shouldn't they can't teach you in school?

136
00:07:59.06 --> 00:08:01.26
And they've cost way more than an MBA.

137
00:08:01.26 --> 00:08:02.10
Yes.

138
00:08:03.98 --> 00:08:04.82
So here we go.

139
00:08:04.82 --> 00:08:06.66
Let's start off talking a little bit about Jocofuel.

140
00:08:06.66 --> 00:08:09.82
Now what's interesting about this is last time

141
00:08:09.82 --> 00:08:12.30
we were together, or I guess during this time frame,

142
00:08:12.30 --> 00:08:13.70
I guess we didn't do it.

143
00:08:13.70 --> 00:08:18.70
We were getting to a point where we,

144
00:08:19.70 --> 00:08:24.70
as we had predicted, we were starting to need money.

145
00:08:25.78 --> 00:08:28.30
So we were starting to need money.

146
00:08:28.30 --> 00:08:31.66
This is a cash intensive business.

147
00:08:31.66 --> 00:08:34.22
Making food products, making supplements,

148
00:08:34.22 --> 00:08:38.98
being in retail, having to order millions

149
00:08:38.98 --> 00:08:43.30
and sometimes tens of millions of dollars worth of product

150
00:08:43.30 --> 00:08:45.34
and having to pay for that.

151
00:08:45.34 --> 00:08:50.34
And then having to hold on and hold your breath

152
00:08:51.26 --> 00:08:56.26
and pinch pennies until maybe 90, 120, 180 days,

153
00:08:58.06 --> 00:08:59.78
that money starts to come back in.

154
00:08:59.78 --> 00:09:04.30
We got, we did a lot of breath holding in this ramp up.

155
00:09:04.30 --> 00:09:06.22
And that's kind of the phase we were in last year

156
00:09:06.22 --> 00:09:07.22
around this time.

157
00:09:07.22 --> 00:09:11.14
We were in that every quarter, every month really,

158
00:09:11.14 --> 00:09:15.02
would be a breath hold, waiting for payment to come in.

159
00:09:16.22 --> 00:09:17.46
It's not a great feeling.

160
00:09:17.46 --> 00:09:20.42
Yeah, and behind the scenes, last year, during camp,

161
00:09:20.42 --> 00:09:21.82
when we were sitting around in private,

162
00:09:21.82 --> 00:09:24.02
talking about that cash to cash cycle

163
00:09:24.02 --> 00:09:29.02
and how we're starting to burn cash or feed the monster,

164
00:09:29.38 --> 00:09:30.74
the monster eats cash.

165
00:09:30.74 --> 00:09:34.14
I mean, knowing our goals for mass distribution

166
00:09:34.14 --> 00:09:36.66
and to try to get the things we're making

167
00:09:36.66 --> 00:09:40.38
in the hands of humanity, I mean, America for sure,

168
00:09:40.38 --> 00:09:43.42
that it was gonna be expensive growth.

169
00:09:43.42 --> 00:09:48.42
And definitely as committing to larger and larger orders,

170
00:09:50.42 --> 00:09:52.78
should there, something, there go wrong,

171
00:09:52.78 --> 00:09:57.78
knowing that you then have to dump, let's say, screw ups,

172
00:09:58.30 --> 00:10:02.58
which has a massive impact on cash flow also.

173
00:10:02.58 --> 00:10:04.50
We didn't have too many of those, had a couple.

174
00:10:04.50 --> 00:10:09.50
But yeah, man, the monster finally got fed, luckily,

175
00:10:12.10 --> 00:10:14.78
with the investment we took on with that great investor.

176
00:10:14.78 --> 00:10:19.78
But burning that cash for so long, as long as we could,

177
00:10:21.70 --> 00:10:24.70
and knowing that the right thing to do was to bring

178
00:10:24.70 --> 00:10:28.26
on a partner that could help us blow this thing up,

179
00:10:28.26 --> 00:10:31.98
was definitely challenging, knowing how we work together

180
00:10:31.98 --> 00:10:35.62
and how we make decisions and how we communicate

181
00:10:35.62 --> 00:10:39.10
and sticking somebody else in the mix that we don't know

182
00:10:39.10 --> 00:10:41.82
and trying to trust that process

183
00:10:41.82 --> 00:10:44.74
that they're gonna plug in easily.

184
00:10:44.74 --> 00:10:47.62
I think that for me was the most difficult thing,

185
00:10:47.62 --> 00:10:51.66
not even the other stuff, not having to dump flavor systems

186
00:10:51.66 --> 00:10:56.26
or overwrap cans because there's a can shortage,

187
00:10:56.26 --> 00:11:01.26
or try to pivot on where we're buying our ingredients from.

188
00:11:01.26 --> 00:11:04.70
It was really trying to plug somebody else

189
00:11:04.70 --> 00:11:06.02
into the equation.

190
00:11:06.02 --> 00:11:09.62
It could have gone terribly bad if it wasn't done right.

191
00:11:09.62 --> 00:11:14.42
So obviously, we had some decent offers

192
00:11:14.42 --> 00:11:16.18
from the different private equity firms and whatnot,

193
00:11:16.18 --> 00:11:19.34
but I honestly didn't think we were gonna find any

194
00:11:19.34 --> 00:11:22.14
at one point, I was kinda like, damn,

195
00:11:22.14 --> 00:11:24.62
this just isn't gonna happen and we're gonna have to

196
00:11:24.62 --> 00:11:29.62
either shrink and rethink, or I actually didn't know.

197
00:11:29.62 --> 00:11:32.86
Yeah, well, we had, I mean, I remember talking about

198
00:11:32.86 --> 00:11:37.50
Plan A, B, C, D, and that's what we had to do.

199
00:11:39.62 --> 00:11:42.54
That, the fact that you and I,

200
00:11:42.54 --> 00:11:45.86
sometimes, well, oftentimes we're making decisions in,

201
00:11:45.86 --> 00:11:49.86
I mean, multi-million dollar decisions in three texts

202
00:11:49.86 --> 00:11:54.86
or seven text messages, and it's always been like that.

203
00:11:54.90 --> 00:11:58.98
That is definitely a scary thing to mess up because,

204
00:11:58.98 --> 00:12:01.38
and look, I have the benefit of working with

205
00:12:01.38 --> 00:12:03.42
so many different companies at Eshalon Front

206
00:12:03.42 --> 00:12:05.90
that I see how hard it is for companies

207
00:12:05.90 --> 00:12:07.78
to make decisions sometimes when you have

208
00:12:07.78 --> 00:12:10.54
just a little bit different agendas going on

209
00:12:10.54 --> 00:12:13.26
and egos pop up and all of a sudden,

210
00:12:13.26 --> 00:12:15.78
simple decisions that should take 15 minutes,

211
00:12:15.78 --> 00:12:18.14
they end up taking 15 weeks, and I'm not kidding,

212
00:12:18.14 --> 00:12:21.58
like literally simple decisions that you can see

213
00:12:21.58 --> 00:12:25.82
the obvious answer for can take months instead of minutes.

214
00:12:25.82 --> 00:12:30.62
And we were operating in the minutes timeframe.

215
00:12:30.62 --> 00:12:33.18
And the other thing that was kind of cool

216
00:12:33.18 --> 00:12:36.94
was because we were living paycheck to paycheck for so long,

217
00:12:36.94 --> 00:12:38.38
man, we were lean.

218
00:12:38.38 --> 00:12:39.22
Super lean.

219
00:12:39.22 --> 00:12:42.18
Super lean, and it was just no fat.

220
00:12:42.18 --> 00:12:45.66
We were like a fighter that had cut weight

221
00:12:45.66 --> 00:12:47.82
and just barely made it, right?

222
00:12:47.82 --> 00:12:50.86
And we were doing that, it was like wrestling season.

223
00:12:50.86 --> 00:12:53.78
Every Wednesday and every Saturday, we were making weight.

224
00:12:53.78 --> 00:12:55.42
We were trying to see if we could shed a little bit of,

225
00:12:55.42 --> 00:12:57.54
we were sitting in the sauna trying to squeeze out

226
00:12:57.54 --> 00:13:01.06
a little bit of another extra eight ounces.

227
00:13:01.06 --> 00:13:05.46
And but what I liked about that is it made us good, right?

228
00:13:05.46 --> 00:13:06.82
It made us good.

229
00:13:06.82 --> 00:13:08.34
You ask someone that wrestled,

230
00:13:08.34 --> 00:13:10.98
hey, you tell them they gotta lose 15 pounds,

231
00:13:10.98 --> 00:13:12.46
they look at you like it's a joke.

232
00:13:12.46 --> 00:13:15.70
So we got rid of a lot of excess weight.

233
00:13:15.70 --> 00:13:19.22
We became very streamlined, but the problem was,

234
00:13:19.22 --> 00:13:21.74
and this is sort of the backup plan was,

235
00:13:21.74 --> 00:13:25.38
we were just gonna have to expand and grow a lot slower.

236
00:13:25.38 --> 00:13:26.70
That's what was gonna happen.

237
00:13:26.70 --> 00:13:29.58
So if we wouldn't have met good partners

238
00:13:29.58 --> 00:13:31.38
who's out of New York, great guys,

239
00:13:31.38 --> 00:13:35.06
if we wouldn't have met them, we would have done plan B

240
00:13:35.06 --> 00:13:37.38
and we would have made some adjustments

241
00:13:37.38 --> 00:13:39.74
and it would have been a slower growth.

242
00:13:39.74 --> 00:13:42.90
And the problem with that for me,

243
00:13:42.90 --> 00:13:44.58
is this is the same thing that I told the team

244
00:13:44.58 --> 00:13:45.78
at Jock of Fuel yesterday.

245
00:13:45.78 --> 00:13:49.42
At Escalon Front, we go and we go to the muster.

246
00:13:49.42 --> 00:13:54.42
And at the muster, we'll have scores of people,

247
00:13:54.42 --> 00:13:58.14
come up to every team member, to JP, to Lave, to me, to Dave,

248
00:13:58.14 --> 00:14:00.50
to everybody, and the individual come up and say,

249
00:14:00.50 --> 00:14:03.94
oh, you know, hey, I got my business back,

250
00:14:03.94 --> 00:14:04.90
we were about to go bankrupt,

251
00:14:04.90 --> 00:14:06.42
we recovered everything, we're hiring now,

252
00:14:06.42 --> 00:14:08.18
or oh, but I was about to get divorced

253
00:14:08.18 --> 00:14:09.66
and my wife and I are back together

254
00:14:09.66 --> 00:14:14.26
and I lost 58 pounds and just all these incredible stories

255
00:14:14.26 --> 00:14:15.46
that you hear.

256
00:14:15.46 --> 00:14:20.22
And it sounds great, but every muster debrief,

257
00:14:20.22 --> 00:14:25.10
what I tell the team is, hey, great job with this small

258
00:14:25.10 --> 00:14:27.74
number of people that we helped with these principles.

259
00:14:27.74 --> 00:14:31.66
And there are literally millions and millions of people

260
00:14:31.66 --> 00:14:35.22
that need these principles to help them in their life.

261
00:14:35.22 --> 00:14:36.34
And we're not reaching them right now,

262
00:14:36.34 --> 00:14:37.98
so we're not doing what we should be doing.

263
00:14:37.98 --> 00:14:39.50
And it's the same thing with Jock of Fuel.

264
00:14:39.50 --> 00:14:42.34
Right now, right now, as you and I are sitting here talking,

265
00:14:42.34 --> 00:14:46.30
there's a 22 year old kid that's drinking an energy drink

266
00:14:46.30 --> 00:14:48.46
that's absolutely horrible for him.

267
00:14:48.46 --> 00:14:49.30
That's what's happening.

268
00:14:49.30 --> 00:14:51.98
There's another seven year old kid

269
00:14:51.98 --> 00:14:54.78
that's drinking a chocolate milk that's filled with

270
00:14:54.78 --> 00:14:57.62
high fructose corn syrup and it's absolutely horrible for him.

271
00:14:57.62 --> 00:14:59.06
And his mom doesn't know,

272
00:14:59.06 --> 00:15:00.50
his mom doesn't know what's available,

273
00:15:00.50 --> 00:15:02.02
so that's the issue.

274
00:15:02.02 --> 00:15:07.02
So as in my own mind, I had the part of my brain saying,

275
00:15:08.78 --> 00:15:10.58
hey, hang on, we can hang on.

276
00:15:10.58 --> 00:15:13.14
And the other part of my brain is saying, who are we hurting?

277
00:15:13.14 --> 00:15:16.42
And the compromise is, okay, how about,

278
00:15:16.42 --> 00:15:19.10
and what we eventually did is a minority share

279
00:15:19.10 --> 00:15:22.30
we sold a minority share, brought in great partners

280
00:15:22.30 --> 00:15:24.38
that have some great brands.

281
00:15:24.38 --> 00:15:27.18
I mean, they've built and run some great companies,

282
00:15:27.18 --> 00:15:30.06
I mean, just outstanding.

283
00:15:30.06 --> 00:15:35.06
So that made it, that was nice.

284
00:15:35.06 --> 00:15:37.18
It was like at the end of wrestling season,

285
00:15:37.18 --> 00:15:38.38
where all of a sudden,

286
00:15:38.38 --> 00:15:41.02
we didn't have to cut weight every Wednesday and Saturday.

287
00:15:41.02 --> 00:15:43.50
Yes. Because we have some room.

288
00:15:43.50 --> 00:15:45.78
I definitely saw the relief on the finance team.

289
00:15:45.78 --> 00:15:50.78
Don got to sit back in his chair for about five minutes

290
00:15:50.90 --> 00:15:52.90
and go, ah, you know, I mean,

291
00:15:52.90 --> 00:15:57.62
because being that lean and running just in time inventory

292
00:15:57.62 --> 00:15:59.62
and at one point, Joe Moss,

293
00:15:59.62 --> 00:16:01.90
our chief revenue officer said,

294
00:16:01.90 --> 00:16:03.10
man, we're running this company

295
00:16:03.10 --> 00:16:05.54
with like nine people in three ball dudes.

296
00:16:05.54 --> 00:16:07.26
You know what I mean?

297
00:16:07.26 --> 00:16:10.26
Me, basically me, Joe and Brian there, whatever.

298
00:16:10.26 --> 00:16:13.66
And you're looking at our growth rate and our trajectory

299
00:16:13.66 --> 00:16:17.58
and it's like, damn, Joe, like that's funny, but it's right.

300
00:16:17.58 --> 00:16:18.74
And you know what?

301
00:16:18.74 --> 00:16:21.86
Running the business like you're on a desert island

302
00:16:21.86 --> 00:16:25.06
is gonna allow you, you know, you would think,

303
00:16:25.06 --> 00:16:28.38
now you're gonna be a good steward of that investment.

304
00:16:28.38 --> 00:16:30.14
You know, and I was talking to you about

305
00:16:30.14 --> 00:16:31.98
as far as like living into the brand,

306
00:16:31.98 --> 00:16:34.78
like after that investment came on,

307
00:16:34.78 --> 00:16:38.42
I felt like, I felt again that same kind of like,

308
00:16:38.42 --> 00:16:39.98
when I went back in the day,

309
00:16:39.98 --> 00:16:42.14
when remortgaging the house for origin,

310
00:16:42.14 --> 00:16:44.18
I felt the same thing like, man,

311
00:16:44.18 --> 00:16:46.10
you know, some of our family and friends

312
00:16:46.10 --> 00:16:48.70
invested in this with us alongside of us.

313
00:16:48.70 --> 00:16:49.66
All my family and friends.

314
00:16:49.66 --> 00:16:50.50
All your family and friends.

315
00:16:50.50 --> 00:16:52.86
Like, yeah, I mean, everyone I know.

316
00:16:52.86 --> 00:16:53.70
Yeah, hang on.

317
00:16:53.70 --> 00:16:54.82
That's a broad statement,

318
00:16:54.82 --> 00:16:57.58
but like a lot of people that are very close to me

319
00:16:57.58 --> 00:16:58.70
are in the game with us.

320
00:16:58.70 --> 00:17:00.90
And I think that's important that like,

321
00:17:00.90 --> 00:17:03.70
this new partner allowed us to bring our family and friends

322
00:17:03.70 --> 00:17:05.02
into my childhood friend.

323
00:17:05.02 --> 00:17:06.46
I've known since I was 12 years old,

324
00:17:06.46 --> 00:17:07.50
invested in this thing.

325
00:17:07.50 --> 00:17:08.34
You know what I mean?

326
00:17:08.34 --> 00:17:13.34
Man, I better be a good steward of this and like I said,

327
00:17:13.74 --> 00:17:15.54
live into it.

328
00:17:15.54 --> 00:17:16.38
You know what I mean?

329
00:17:16.38 --> 00:17:18.50
And you were like, what is live into it?

330
00:17:18.50 --> 00:17:22.90
Like, well, I'm gonna, I haven't been, you know what I mean?

331
00:17:22.90 --> 00:17:25.86
I like them cookies and that ice cream.

332
00:17:25.86 --> 00:17:30.86
But how well have you been quote living into it this week?

333
00:17:31.06 --> 00:17:36.06
Dude, I've seen you consume more cookies, brownies.

334
00:17:37.02 --> 00:17:38.22
What is going on, dude?

335
00:17:38.22 --> 00:17:40.46
We've been living into that jujitsu immersion.

336
00:17:40.46 --> 00:17:45.46
Poha that, you know, late night, cold cut combo snack.

337
00:17:46.54 --> 00:17:48.74
Just get in there, dude.

338
00:17:48.74 --> 00:17:51.86
But I mean, you know, like as far as understanding

339
00:17:51.86 --> 00:17:55.82
the psyche of the consumer, of the people out there,

340
00:17:55.82 --> 00:18:00.82
because I believe right now, and if you look at America,

341
00:18:01.26 --> 00:18:04.94
I think we're the strongest and healthiest we've ever been.

342
00:18:04.94 --> 00:18:07.70
And I think we're the most unhealthy

343
00:18:07.70 --> 00:18:09.18
and most out of shape.

344
00:18:09.18 --> 00:18:10.66
The term of America at large.

345
00:18:10.66 --> 00:18:12.86
The people of America.

346
00:18:12.86 --> 00:18:14.74
And it's probably a worldwide thing too,

347
00:18:14.74 --> 00:18:18.54
but we're, you're, there's some strong people.

348
00:18:18.54 --> 00:18:19.94
Strongest we've ever been.

349
00:18:19.94 --> 00:18:20.78
100%.

350
00:18:20.78 --> 00:18:21.78
And healthiest we've ever been.

351
00:18:21.78 --> 00:18:25.34
And then the heaviest and the most unhealthy.

352
00:18:25.34 --> 00:18:27.42
And people dying of all sorts of shit.

353
00:18:27.42 --> 00:18:30.50
And there's this freaking gap, you know?

354
00:18:30.50 --> 00:18:32.10
And yeah, you can point the finger,

355
00:18:32.10 --> 00:18:35.02
but the finger goes in a lot of different directions.

356
00:18:35.02 --> 00:18:37.30
You gotta have a lot of finger pointing.

357
00:18:37.30 --> 00:18:38.30
The fact of the matter is,

358
00:18:38.30 --> 00:18:40.90
is we're trying to fill the void between the two.

359
00:18:40.90 --> 00:18:44.78
You know, and educate people in a different way.

360
00:18:44.78 --> 00:18:47.86
And, you know, and Jocko Fuel as a mission,

361
00:18:47.86 --> 00:18:50.66
as a movement, and the things we're doing,

362
00:18:50.66 --> 00:18:52.78
it's no different than the origin side.

363
00:18:52.78 --> 00:18:54.30
You know, origin built to believe,

364
00:18:54.30 --> 00:18:55.34
built to believe in the dream,

365
00:18:55.34 --> 00:18:59.30
built to believe in resurrection of America's factories

366
00:18:59.30 --> 00:19:01.38
and communities and the reclamation and the reshoring

367
00:19:01.38 --> 00:19:02.78
and the restoring of the communities.

368
00:19:02.78 --> 00:19:05.26
And Jocko Fuel built to be better.

369
00:19:05.26 --> 00:19:07.18
You know, it's the same damn thing.

370
00:19:07.18 --> 00:19:09.42
Everything you wear, everything you consume,

371
00:19:09.42 --> 00:19:13.10
like it's right there.

372
00:19:13.10 --> 00:19:13.94
You know what I mean?

373
00:19:13.94 --> 00:19:14.78
It's right there.

374
00:19:14.78 --> 00:19:19.78
But then how do you wedge that into this country

375
00:19:19.98 --> 00:19:22.38
which is not just divided,

376
00:19:22.38 --> 00:19:26.38
also from a health and physical perspective, it's divided.

377
00:19:26.38 --> 00:19:30.18
So there's this education process that's taking place.

378
00:19:30.18 --> 00:19:32.58
And honestly, taking on the investment

379
00:19:32.58 --> 00:19:34.54
is gonna allow us to do more of this education

380
00:19:34.54 --> 00:19:35.38
across the board.

381
00:19:35.38 --> 00:19:38.10
So that was the point I was getting at,

382
00:19:38.10 --> 00:19:39.98
was like looking at weighing between,

383
00:19:39.98 --> 00:19:42.34
okay, we can keep total control

384
00:19:42.34 --> 00:19:45.50
and be a little bit greedy.

385
00:19:45.50 --> 00:19:46.34
Right.

386
00:19:46.34 --> 00:19:48.78
And hang on, this is mine, or say, hey, listen,

387
00:19:48.78 --> 00:19:50.94
let's get this as many people as we can.

388
00:19:50.94 --> 00:19:53.86
So we made that adjustment.

389
00:19:53.86 --> 00:19:55.50
And so far, it's been awesome.

390
00:19:55.50 --> 00:19:57.90
It's been awesome to have more freedom of movement for us.

391
00:19:57.90 --> 00:20:00.58
It's been awesome to still be able to push forward

392
00:20:00.58 --> 00:20:03.14
in ways that we weren't pushing forward before

393
00:20:03.14 --> 00:20:06.70
and be able to execute on things that we would have had to.

394
00:20:06.70 --> 00:20:10.86
You know, plan B and plan C didn't have the same products

395
00:20:10.86 --> 00:20:14.02
coming out, we weren't able to tackle the same problems

396
00:20:14.02 --> 00:20:15.78
that we're gonna be able to tackle now.

397
00:20:15.78 --> 00:20:18.26
So that was awesome.

398
00:20:19.30 --> 00:20:22.14
As that's going on, meanwhile,

399
00:20:22.14 --> 00:20:25.10
we expanded outside the state of Maine,

400
00:20:25.10 --> 00:20:27.06
which I may have broke your heart initially

401
00:20:28.10 --> 00:20:29.26
because you're a Maina.

402
00:20:29.26 --> 00:20:33.66
I am a Maina, I'm actually a mass hole technically.

403
00:20:33.66 --> 00:20:36.90
My father-in-law, Joe, will never allow me to claim being

404
00:20:36.90 --> 00:20:37.90
a Maina. Oh, he doesn't let you claim, huh?

405
00:20:37.90 --> 00:20:39.94
No, I'm from Massachusetts, man.

406
00:20:39.94 --> 00:20:42.30
Even though I've been here since I was eight years old,

407
00:20:42.30 --> 00:20:43.14
never a Maina.

408
00:20:43.14 --> 00:20:45.30
And your kids can't, your kids can't,

409
00:20:45.30 --> 00:20:46.26
they think I'm a mass hole too.

410
00:20:46.26 --> 00:20:48.26
They can't anchor baby you up here?

411
00:20:48.26 --> 00:20:50.02
No, I wish.

412
00:20:50.02 --> 00:20:55.02
No, but yeah, I mean, you know, like as this is all going on,

413
00:20:55.02 --> 00:20:57.94
as we're going through the process of investment

414
00:20:57.94 --> 00:20:59.54
and having all these meetings and everything.

415
00:20:59.54 --> 00:21:00.38
And at the same time.

416
00:21:00.38 --> 00:21:01.46
That's one monster.

417
00:21:01.46 --> 00:21:02.62
Yeah, one monster.

418
00:21:02.62 --> 00:21:04.74
One monster, Jock with Fuel, is hungry.

419
00:21:04.74 --> 00:21:06.58
Very hungry.

420
00:21:06.58 --> 00:21:10.66
And like needs attention and food and money.

421
00:21:10.66 --> 00:21:11.50
Yes.

422
00:21:11.50 --> 00:21:12.54
That's all going on.

423
00:21:12.54 --> 00:21:14.82
And that's a huge, huge deal.

424
00:21:14.82 --> 00:21:16.22
But then on the other side, the other monster,

425
00:21:16.22 --> 00:21:18.10
the origin monster is also hungry.

426
00:21:18.10 --> 00:21:20.70
To your point earlier, these things are tangled

427
00:21:20.70 --> 00:21:22.42
like Siamese twins.

428
00:21:22.42 --> 00:21:24.54
And these monsters are both, they're growing

429
00:21:24.54 --> 00:21:25.82
and they both need to be fed.

430
00:21:25.82 --> 00:21:28.94
And like someone has to conduct surgery.

431
00:21:28.94 --> 00:21:29.78
Yeah.

432
00:21:29.78 --> 00:21:30.82
And just from another perspective,

433
00:21:30.82 --> 00:21:35.14
they're both in being tangled, in being connected,

434
00:21:35.14 --> 00:21:36.74
they're also mutually supporting.

435
00:21:36.74 --> 00:21:37.58
They need each other.

436
00:21:37.58 --> 00:21:39.26
They totally need each other.

437
00:21:39.26 --> 00:21:42.50
And especially, you know, a year ago, it was like,

438
00:21:42.50 --> 00:21:44.54
without one, there really wouldn't be the other.

439
00:21:44.54 --> 00:21:46.26
And without the other, there wouldn't really be the one.

440
00:21:46.26 --> 00:21:51.26
So you had this, the one is eating, you know,

441
00:21:51.46 --> 00:21:52.94
is eating big, taking big bites.

442
00:21:52.94 --> 00:21:55.34
So the other one, now all of a sudden you start hearing

443
00:21:55.34 --> 00:21:59.26
like the stomach of the origin monster starts to growl.

444
00:21:59.26 --> 00:22:01.10
Yeah.

445
00:22:01.10 --> 00:22:02.46
Yeah, exactly.

446
00:22:02.46 --> 00:22:06.66
And you know, we, I think in an effort to make sure

447
00:22:06.66 --> 00:22:08.10
we're doing things right, you know,

448
00:22:08.10 --> 00:22:10.18
we made our tuition payments on the origin side.

449
00:22:10.18 --> 00:22:15.18
We built the things that built America, Denim and Boots.

450
00:22:15.22 --> 00:22:17.38
We proved we could build them again.

451
00:22:17.38 --> 00:22:20.66
We proved we could find and reclaim the knowledge

452
00:22:20.66 --> 00:22:23.42
and make the product and do it in a way

453
00:22:23.42 --> 00:22:25.22
that it was profitable to.

454
00:22:25.22 --> 00:22:27.50
So we kind of have proved this out.

455
00:22:27.50 --> 00:22:30.18
And it's like, okay, it's time to go, you know?

456
00:22:30.18 --> 00:22:32.98
And if you're not growing, you're dying, you know?

457
00:22:32.98 --> 00:22:35.38
And that's one thing I think in business,

458
00:22:35.38 --> 00:22:38.02
like people, they get comfortable, they get complacent.

459
00:22:38.02 --> 00:22:39.66
Well, listen, if you're not, if you're not growing,

460
00:22:39.66 --> 00:22:41.30
you're dying because somebody smarter than you

461
00:22:41.30 --> 00:22:42.50
is behind you, you know?

462
00:22:42.50 --> 00:22:45.82
And with everything, there's a beginning,

463
00:22:45.82 --> 00:22:47.26
there's a middle, when there's an end

464
00:22:47.26 --> 00:22:50.50
and trying to extend that middle part, it's not a coast.

465
00:22:50.50 --> 00:22:51.62
It's not a flat road.

466
00:22:51.62 --> 00:22:53.14
It's not coasting.

467
00:22:53.14 --> 00:22:55.02
I was telling somebody the other day,

468
00:22:55.02 --> 00:22:56.94
you know, you get to the top of that hill

469
00:22:56.94 --> 00:22:59.18
when you're climbing, you're pedaling and pedaling

470
00:22:59.18 --> 00:23:01.34
and pedaling and you get to the top and you think,

471
00:23:01.34 --> 00:23:02.98
ah, I get to coast on the other side.

472
00:23:02.98 --> 00:23:05.10
The thing is you get to a plateau

473
00:23:05.10 --> 00:23:07.30
and then there's an incline on that plateau.

474
00:23:07.30 --> 00:23:09.98
You can't see over the horizon.

475
00:23:09.98 --> 00:23:11.86
And with Origin, we've been, you know,

476
00:23:11.86 --> 00:23:15.30
we've kind of been playing in the sandbox a little bit.

477
00:23:15.30 --> 00:23:19.66
I, addressing the team, you know, on the inside,

478
00:23:19.66 --> 00:23:23.58
you know, kind of in the trenches earlier this year was,

479
00:23:23.58 --> 00:23:26.54
this year, we start.

480
00:23:27.54 --> 00:23:31.42
I actually said to them, we haven't done anything yet.

481
00:23:31.42 --> 00:23:34.54
We're spread across 250,000 square feet

482
00:23:34.54 --> 00:23:39.42
in two states and 400 people and we haven't even started.

483
00:23:39.42 --> 00:23:42.02
Like this shit, like we've been,

484
00:23:42.02 --> 00:23:45.14
we've been a research and development company.

485
00:23:45.14 --> 00:23:46.74
Now it's time to go.

486
00:23:46.74 --> 00:23:49.66
Now it's time to truly rebuild the supply chains

487
00:23:49.66 --> 00:23:53.14
and build the products that we need and use and wear.

488
00:23:53.14 --> 00:23:57.34
So I kind of, you know, like cast that wide vision

489
00:23:57.34 --> 00:24:02.34
early in the year and even, even the constant touch point,

490
00:24:02.34 --> 00:24:07.02
I think still, you know, still people,

491
00:24:07.02 --> 00:24:11.02
it's almost like, I mean, you have kids, you know,

492
00:24:11.02 --> 00:24:14.90
when I, when I had my first child, Keegan, like Amanda,

493
00:24:14.90 --> 00:24:16.10
you know, she's pregnant.

494
00:24:16.10 --> 00:24:18.26
It's like, cool, you know, you're pregnant and whatever.

495
00:24:18.26 --> 00:24:21.78
And then, then he came out and I was like, holy shit.

496
00:24:21.78 --> 00:24:24.54
What am I going to do with this?

497
00:24:24.54 --> 00:24:25.38
You know what I mean?

498
00:24:25.38 --> 00:24:27.42
Like this is a, this is a real being.

499
00:24:27.42 --> 00:24:29.54
That's kind of how I feel like we're,

500
00:24:29.54 --> 00:24:31.66
we're ready to like go.

501
00:24:31.66 --> 00:24:33.62
Like there's like almost like a little bit of a rebirth,

502
00:24:33.62 --> 00:24:36.50
so to speak this year of what we're going to do

503
00:24:36.50 --> 00:24:40.06
as a company, as a mission, as a, as a movement.

504
00:24:40.06 --> 00:24:42.10
And I could see it.

505
00:24:42.10 --> 00:24:45.18
I know you could see it and I'm trying to explain it

506
00:24:45.18 --> 00:24:48.70
to the team, but they aren't, they aren't feeling it yet

507
00:24:48.70 --> 00:24:51.18
because it's all just words.

508
00:24:51.18 --> 00:24:54.50
But we just, just, I got to fill this out there.

509
00:24:54.50 --> 00:24:59.50
Like I'll go to talk to a gas oil company in North Dakota

510
00:24:59.94 --> 00:25:02.46
or I'll go talk to an energy company in Texas

511
00:25:02.46 --> 00:25:05.94
or we'll talk to a construction company in Illinois

512
00:25:05.94 --> 00:25:10.58
or just, just, and there'll be a bunch of people

513
00:25:10.58 --> 00:25:12.98
that will show up with the lab origin genes on,

514
00:25:12.98 --> 00:25:14.86
they'll have origin boots on.

515
00:25:14.86 --> 00:25:16.30
They're in the game.

516
00:25:16.30 --> 00:25:17.94
They're so supportive.

517
00:25:17.94 --> 00:25:21.42
And so I think that, I get to see that, right?

518
00:25:21.42 --> 00:25:23.54
I get to see people all over the country

519
00:25:23.54 --> 00:25:26.10
that are, that understand what we're doing

520
00:25:26.10 --> 00:25:28.42
and they're so supportive of it.

521
00:25:28.42 --> 00:25:30.90
And I probably didn't do a great job of, you know,

522
00:25:30.90 --> 00:25:32.70
I should be taking a picture every time that happens.

523
00:25:32.70 --> 00:25:35.54
I'm sending it to you like, hey, show everybody this picture.

524
00:25:35.54 --> 00:25:37.66
I mean, I've been to events where there's like 12 people

525
00:25:37.66 --> 00:25:39.74
come up and they're all wearing origin genes.

526
00:25:39.74 --> 00:25:41.54
Like how, how awesome is that?

527
00:25:41.54 --> 00:25:43.06
And you know, this will be in the middle of wherever,

528
00:25:43.06 --> 00:25:45.22
Oklahoma, it's, it's, it's awesome.

529
00:25:45.22 --> 00:25:48.90
So yeah, you can start to, you and I can sense

530
00:25:48.90 --> 00:25:52.34
all that happening and probably need to do a better job

531
00:25:52.34 --> 00:25:54.42
making sure everybody on the team knows that.

532
00:25:54.42 --> 00:25:56.94
Yeah, and in there, you know, it's interesting.

533
00:25:56.94 --> 00:25:58.06
I don't know how to look at this.

534
00:25:58.06 --> 00:26:01.66
They're in the trenches every day, like making the stuff,

535
00:26:01.66 --> 00:26:03.54
answering the phone calls, you know,

536
00:26:03.54 --> 00:26:05.74
doing the marketing and all that stuff.

537
00:26:05.74 --> 00:26:08.98
And we're gonna build 100,000 pairs of genes, right?

538
00:26:08.98 --> 00:26:10.38
Over the next 12 months.

539
00:26:10.38 --> 00:26:13.58
And I'm, and I'm down in Trion, Georgia,

540
00:26:13.58 --> 00:26:16.34
at mountain Vernon Mills, the oldest mill in America

541
00:26:16.34 --> 00:26:18.74
and the last mill that weaves denim

542
00:26:18.74 --> 00:26:21.18
and they weave our denim for us.

543
00:26:21.18 --> 00:26:24.50
And I'm committing to 2 million yards in three years.

544
00:26:25.42 --> 00:26:26.50
And I'm coming back and saying,

545
00:26:26.50 --> 00:26:28.78
hey, I just committed to every single yard of denim

546
00:26:28.78 --> 00:26:29.62
this mill can make.

547
00:26:29.62 --> 00:26:31.50
You know what I mean?

548
00:26:31.50 --> 00:26:33.26
They're like, oh, okay.

549
00:26:33.26 --> 00:26:34.50
Okay.

550
00:26:34.50 --> 00:26:36.46
This is like being in Vegas, man.

551
00:26:36.46 --> 00:26:38.78
And just taking your wallet and putting it on black.

552
00:26:38.78 --> 00:26:39.78
100%.

553
00:26:39.78 --> 00:26:40.62
100%.

554
00:26:40.62 --> 00:26:42.74
You know, so there's, there's like,

555
00:26:42.74 --> 00:26:44.34
how are we gonna fill the gap?

556
00:26:44.34 --> 00:26:46.98
How are we gonna go from point A to point B?

557
00:26:46.98 --> 00:26:48.78
And speaking of feeding the monsters,

558
00:26:48.78 --> 00:26:50.78
oh, we're gonna build 100,000 pairs of genes

559
00:26:50.78 --> 00:26:53.18
in three years, we're gonna build a million, you know?

560
00:26:53.18 --> 00:26:54.86
And on the jockel fuel side,

561
00:26:54.86 --> 00:26:57.22
oh, we're making 30,000 cases of this a month

562
00:26:57.22 --> 00:26:59.22
and we need to get to 200,000 in three years.

563
00:26:59.22 --> 00:27:01.94
You have these two, these two monsters

564
00:27:01.94 --> 00:27:06.54
that you actually know like the, what they're gonna eat.

565
00:27:06.54 --> 00:27:08.94
You know that, you know the, you use the baby.

566
00:27:08.94 --> 00:27:09.78
Consumption.

567
00:27:09.78 --> 00:27:10.62
The consumption rate.

568
00:27:10.62 --> 00:27:11.98
You know how much freaking milk

569
00:27:11.98 --> 00:27:15.06
it's gonna take to get these kids to be full grown.

570
00:27:15.06 --> 00:27:15.90
That's right.

571
00:27:15.90 --> 00:27:16.74
And so you need to plan for it.

572
00:27:16.74 --> 00:27:18.10
And you know, at some point,

573
00:27:18.10 --> 00:27:21.22
they're gonna be a 16 and a half year old boy

574
00:27:21.22 --> 00:27:24.34
and they're gonna have a voracious appetite.

575
00:27:24.34 --> 00:27:25.18
Exactly.

576
00:27:25.18 --> 00:27:26.38
And it's gonna be nuts.

577
00:27:26.38 --> 00:27:27.82
And we actually know that.

578
00:27:27.82 --> 00:27:28.78
We can plot it out.

579
00:27:28.78 --> 00:27:30.18
We can see it.

580
00:27:30.18 --> 00:27:33.98
And so that, so that's, as you look at that growth

581
00:27:33.98 --> 00:27:36.38
and the amount of effort it was gonna take

582
00:27:36.38 --> 00:27:39.46
or the amount of work that it was gonna take to get done,

583
00:27:39.46 --> 00:27:42.86
you knew that we were gonna reach our limit here in Maine.

584
00:27:42.86 --> 00:27:43.98
100%.

585
00:27:43.98 --> 00:27:44.82
Yep.

586
00:27:44.82 --> 00:27:46.70
And just walking around the factory

587
00:27:46.70 --> 00:27:49.62
and just we have pivoted and pivoted and pivoted

588
00:27:49.62 --> 00:27:53.26
and pivoted and gotten leaner and leaner and leaner and leaner.

589
00:27:53.26 --> 00:27:54.74
I mean, and you gotta remember in that,

590
00:27:54.74 --> 00:27:56.34
in our first little, you know,

591
00:27:56.34 --> 00:28:01.14
our first big factory after we left the woods, right?

592
00:28:01.14 --> 00:28:04.14
Like when you came on board and we partnered up,

593
00:28:04.14 --> 00:28:06.14
we were still in the woods and we're like,

594
00:28:06.14 --> 00:28:11.14
we're gonna buy this big building like 20,000 square feet.

595
00:28:12.34 --> 00:28:14.18
Where we're at one point,

596
00:28:14.18 --> 00:28:16.54
Jocko Fuel literally was on pallets

597
00:28:16.54 --> 00:28:18.10
in between all the sewing machines.

598
00:28:18.10 --> 00:28:21.38
So just so people understand how these things were tangled.

599
00:28:21.38 --> 00:28:26.38
And so we moved into that building in 2017 July.

600
00:28:26.54 --> 00:28:29.78
And when we did that, we had 12 employees.

601
00:28:29.78 --> 00:28:30.62
Yeah, 12.

602
00:28:30.62 --> 00:28:31.46
12 employees.

603
00:28:31.46 --> 00:28:33.66
I mean, it was cool.

604
00:28:33.66 --> 00:28:34.74
It was cool.

605
00:28:34.74 --> 00:28:36.38
And you walked around and it was like, okay, cool.

606
00:28:36.38 --> 00:28:37.94
We got like plenty of room to grow, right?

607
00:28:37.94 --> 00:28:39.18
Oh, we got plenty of room to grow.

608
00:28:39.18 --> 00:28:40.10
Not so much.

609
00:28:40.10 --> 00:28:42.14
Not so much.

610
00:28:42.14 --> 00:28:44.94
So, you know, there's a, you know,

611
00:28:44.94 --> 00:28:47.30
just walking around and thinking,

612
00:28:47.30 --> 00:28:51.38
this is not going to sustain us.

613
00:28:51.38 --> 00:28:54.02
And looking at the kind of stepping back out of the trenches,

614
00:28:54.02 --> 00:28:55.42
looking at the battlefield,

615
00:28:55.42 --> 00:28:58.62
going, how are we gonna go from, you know,

616
00:28:58.62 --> 00:29:02.58
point A to point B when it comes to knitwear,

617
00:29:02.58 --> 00:29:03.58
when it comes to hoodies,

618
00:29:03.58 --> 00:29:05.98
when it comes to T-shirts, when it comes to denim,

619
00:29:05.98 --> 00:29:08.38
when it comes to all the things we need to make,

620
00:29:09.46 --> 00:29:12.38
we're going to have to look elsewhere.

621
00:29:12.38 --> 00:29:13.70
We're going to have to look elsewhere

622
00:29:13.70 --> 00:29:15.78
closer to the supply chains,

623
00:29:15.78 --> 00:29:19.10
knowing that what we're really good at in Maine

624
00:29:19.10 --> 00:29:21.38
is building ultra durable goods like footwear

625
00:29:21.38 --> 00:29:23.06
and jujitsu giz.

626
00:29:23.06 --> 00:29:25.70
And that the cotton supply chain,

627
00:29:25.70 --> 00:29:29.74
the weaving and the dying is all more down

628
00:29:29.74 --> 00:29:33.82
in North Carolina, in Georgia, Louisiana,

629
00:29:33.82 --> 00:29:35.62
you know, South Carolina,

630
00:29:35.62 --> 00:29:37.90
is there opportunity down there?

631
00:29:37.90 --> 00:29:39.54
And we found some opportunity.

632
00:29:40.66 --> 00:29:45.66
So, we found a company that was going to cut and sew for us.

633
00:29:48.30 --> 00:29:52.26
And man, they were starting to work on some projects for us.

634
00:29:52.26 --> 00:29:54.82
And I remember just calling you and being like,

635
00:29:54.82 --> 00:29:59.82
bro, we got to try and buy this place,

636
00:29:59.94 --> 00:30:01.58
like walking into that for the first time

637
00:30:01.58 --> 00:30:04.34
and seeing it three times bigger than what we're doing

638
00:30:04.34 --> 00:30:06.02
and just cranking stuff out.

639
00:30:06.02 --> 00:30:08.58
I was like, oh man, God, like you don't know

640
00:30:08.58 --> 00:30:10.90
what you don't know, you know?

641
00:30:10.90 --> 00:30:13.58
And I actually say that to my kids, like, hey, you know,

642
00:30:13.58 --> 00:30:15.22
you don't know what you don't know

643
00:30:16.30 --> 00:30:18.14
and you can't control what you can't control,

644
00:30:18.14 --> 00:30:21.50
but you can respond, you can control the way you respond

645
00:30:21.50 --> 00:30:23.02
to things you can't control.

646
00:30:23.02 --> 00:30:25.50
Well, we can respond to the things we don't know,

647
00:30:25.50 --> 00:30:28.06
we can control the way we respond to it, you know,

648
00:30:28.06 --> 00:30:31.18
and try not to have an entrepreneurial seizure

649
00:30:31.18 --> 00:30:34.86
at the same time, which, you know,

650
00:30:34.86 --> 00:30:37.50
we had some opportunities to have, I think.

651
00:30:37.50 --> 00:30:42.50
But we bought two factories.

652
00:30:42.98 --> 00:30:44.62
Let's talk through the first one.

653
00:30:44.62 --> 00:30:45.38
Yeah. Right.

654
00:30:45.38 --> 00:30:47.50
So, it's 60,000 square feet.

655
00:30:48.42 --> 00:30:49.70
You roll down there.

656
00:30:49.70 --> 00:30:51.62
There's not a for sale sign on it.

657
00:30:51.62 --> 00:30:52.46
No, it's not for sale.

658
00:30:52.46 --> 00:30:53.30
You know what I'm saying?

659
00:30:53.30 --> 00:30:55.78
Like, this isn't like you go on a used car lot.

660
00:30:55.78 --> 00:30:58.82
There's a used, you know, cut and sew factory for sale

661
00:30:58.82 --> 00:31:00.30
and you, hey, hey, how much is this?

662
00:31:00.30 --> 00:31:01.94
And you know, that's not how it worked.

663
00:31:01.94 --> 00:31:04.54
No, and these, and like they barely have a website.

664
00:31:04.54 --> 00:31:06.18
I mean, you know, there's like all these old,

665
00:31:06.18 --> 00:31:08.34
little old factories spread across America

666
00:31:08.34 --> 00:31:12.30
that are still there that have been surviving.

667
00:31:12.30 --> 00:31:13.94
They have not thrived.

668
00:31:13.94 --> 00:31:16.10
They're not thriving factories.

669
00:31:16.10 --> 00:31:19.58
They've been surviving for the last 25 years

670
00:31:19.58 --> 00:31:22.66
out of a sheer like force of will, right?

671
00:31:22.66 --> 00:31:24.22
Whether a commitment to the people

672
00:31:24.22 --> 00:31:26.86
who have been working there for 25, 30 years,

673
00:31:26.86 --> 00:31:30.10
you know, or not knowing enough to shut it down

674
00:31:30.10 --> 00:31:35.10
or being too, I don't know what the word is on.

675
00:31:35.22 --> 00:31:36.42
Stubborn. Stubborn.

676
00:31:36.42 --> 00:31:38.50
Yeah, to shut it down.

677
00:31:38.50 --> 00:31:41.30
So, luckily I was able to go.

678
00:31:41.30 --> 00:31:43.30
Patriotic, to patriotic to shut it down.

679
00:31:43.30 --> 00:31:44.74
I think patriotic is a better word.

680
00:31:44.74 --> 00:31:45.58
Yeah.

681
00:31:46.46 --> 00:31:48.10
I mean, yeah.

682
00:31:48.10 --> 00:31:51.62
So, went in and met with this old boy Ted,

683
00:31:51.62 --> 00:31:54.38
had some, was it going through some health problems,

684
00:31:54.38 --> 00:31:55.50
kind of sold them on the vision.

685
00:31:55.50 --> 00:32:00.50
Of course, you know, they are looking at a Yankee.

686
00:32:02.54 --> 00:32:04.54
This Yankee coming down.

687
00:32:05.62 --> 00:32:07.50
And there's still some of that there.

688
00:32:07.50 --> 00:32:08.34
You know what I mean?

689
00:32:08.34 --> 00:32:10.14
Like even Jason has said to me,

690
00:32:10.14 --> 00:32:12.38
you know, y'all rich Yankees coming down here.

691
00:32:12.38 --> 00:32:14.30
Bro, you kidding me?

692
00:32:14.30 --> 00:32:15.34
When we started this company,

693
00:32:15.34 --> 00:32:16.82
we didn't have two nickels to rub together

694
00:32:16.82 --> 00:32:18.30
and a bucket to piss in, bro.

695
00:32:18.30 --> 00:32:21.78
Like go on to YouTube and watch how we built this thing.

696
00:32:21.78 --> 00:32:24.18
So, but it's still like these Yankees coming down

697
00:32:24.18 --> 00:32:25.02
and whatever.

698
00:32:25.02 --> 00:32:29.06
So, you know, went down there, met with Ted,

699
00:32:29.06 --> 00:32:33.14
told him what we'd like to do to carry on his vision

700
00:32:33.14 --> 00:32:34.66
and plan for the company.

701
00:32:34.66 --> 00:32:36.86
Obviously, he had a great operator down there

702
00:32:36.86 --> 00:32:39.62
and Jason Gaddy, great operator who's been doing this thing.

703
00:32:39.62 --> 00:32:42.62
And he's really the one that's been sustaining

704
00:32:42.62 --> 00:32:45.10
this organization for a long time.

705
00:32:45.10 --> 00:32:47.22
You know, 120 employees, whatever it is,

706
00:32:47.22 --> 00:32:50.14
and just cutting and sewing, just ripping stuff out,

707
00:32:50.14 --> 00:32:53.46
making stuff for some pretty substantial brands too.

708
00:32:55.46 --> 00:32:58.90
But, you know, it's one of those situations where,

709
00:32:58.90 --> 00:33:03.18
like, okay, this guy's kind of like a lot of talk.

710
00:33:03.18 --> 00:33:05.42
They're thinking you're a lot of talk is what I'm saying.

711
00:33:05.42 --> 00:33:06.34
Yeah, I think so.

712
00:33:06.34 --> 00:33:07.70
And it's tough.

713
00:33:07.70 --> 00:33:10.78
You've got this, you've got these people

714
00:33:10.78 --> 00:33:15.30
who have been running this business for 40, 50 years.

715
00:33:15.30 --> 00:33:18.06
They've owned it for 40, 50 years.

716
00:33:18.06 --> 00:33:20.02
They do things a certain way.

717
00:33:20.02 --> 00:33:21.50
They have a certain culture.

718
00:33:21.50 --> 00:33:22.78
There's a certain pace.

719
00:33:22.78 --> 00:33:24.98
There's a certain vibe.

720
00:33:24.98 --> 00:33:27.42
You know, and just somebody coming in

721
00:33:27.42 --> 00:33:30.30
that could potentially disrupt that is scary.

722
00:33:30.30 --> 00:33:31.66
Scary, you know.

723
00:33:31.66 --> 00:33:35.10
I mean, you're ultimately, people are innately afraid

724
00:33:35.10 --> 00:33:36.22
of the unknown.

725
00:33:36.22 --> 00:33:38.62
You know, it's also what also drives some people.

726
00:33:38.62 --> 00:33:43.62
But I asked him and convinced him,

727
00:33:44.34 --> 00:33:48.78
and not just him, I flew him up to Maine

728
00:33:48.78 --> 00:33:51.50
and showed him our little factory

729
00:33:51.50 --> 00:33:53.10
and showed him what we were doing

730
00:33:53.10 --> 00:33:55.26
and introduced him to the people,

731
00:33:55.26 --> 00:33:57.06
introduced him to Amanda,

732
00:33:57.06 --> 00:33:59.18
obviously turned him onto Jaco.

733
00:33:59.18 --> 00:34:02.90
Like, you know, of course, they know who you are anyways.

734
00:34:02.90 --> 00:34:04.90
So just kind of made that connection.

735
00:34:04.90 --> 00:34:05.74
That always helps.

736
00:34:05.74 --> 00:34:06.82
It's always like you've got plant,

737
00:34:06.82 --> 00:34:09.22
you've got like the, Dedeco says this,

738
00:34:09.22 --> 00:34:12.10
like when somebody comes to his school, right?

739
00:34:12.10 --> 00:34:15.18
Dedeco, one of my business partners,

740
00:34:15.18 --> 00:34:17.38
also my Jiu-Jitsu instructor.

741
00:34:17.38 --> 00:34:19.38
He's got a school down in Massachusetts in Waymouth.

742
00:34:19.38 --> 00:34:22.42
And when people come in, they like,

743
00:34:22.42 --> 00:34:23.70
oh, I want to start Jiu-Jitsu.

744
00:34:23.70 --> 00:34:25.26
And they were like, okay, cool.

745
00:34:25.26 --> 00:34:27.42
Oh, oh, Origin Gees.

746
00:34:27.42 --> 00:34:28.26
Oh, cool.

747
00:34:28.26 --> 00:34:30.10
I think I've heard of this company, Origin.

748
00:34:30.10 --> 00:34:32.66
It's like, yeah, man, yeah, Origin, you know, Origin.

749
00:34:32.66 --> 00:34:36.74
And then they're like, oh, wait, Jaco?

750
00:34:36.74 --> 00:34:38.98
And he's like, yeah, yeah.

751
00:34:38.98 --> 00:34:40.86
You know, he's also my business partner,

752
00:34:40.86 --> 00:34:41.90
my friend or whatever.

753
00:34:41.90 --> 00:34:43.70
And then they sign up right away.

754
00:34:43.70 --> 00:34:45.10
So it's the ringer, right?

755
00:34:45.10 --> 00:34:46.26
Like Jaco's the ringer.

756
00:34:46.26 --> 00:34:48.26
And every negotiation I just pull,

757
00:34:48.26 --> 00:34:51.22
I pull Jaco's name and it always, it always helps.

758
00:34:51.22 --> 00:34:55.02
So, you know, we flew him up to Maine.

759
00:34:55.02 --> 00:34:59.02
We flew up, you know who else we flew up?

760
00:34:59.02 --> 00:35:02.06
The head stitcher and the mechanic.

761
00:35:02.06 --> 00:35:03.42
Yeah.

762
00:35:03.42 --> 00:35:04.26
And that's one of those things.

763
00:35:04.26 --> 00:35:05.86
This is the Hearts and Minds campaign.

764
00:35:05.86 --> 00:35:06.82
Hearts and Minds, man.

765
00:35:06.82 --> 00:35:08.66
And getting to build relationships with people.

766
00:35:08.66 --> 00:35:12.14
And getting them to understand what we understand.

767
00:35:12.14 --> 00:35:13.34
Yes.

768
00:35:13.34 --> 00:35:16.70
I want the mechanic to meet our team and to watch them sell.

769
00:35:17.82 --> 00:35:19.14
That's what I want him to do.

770
00:35:19.14 --> 00:35:22.30
So he can say to Ted, the owner,

771
00:35:22.30 --> 00:35:23.50
hey, these guys are for real.

772
00:35:23.50 --> 00:35:24.90
They know what they're doing.

773
00:35:24.90 --> 00:35:26.06
I get what they're doing.

774
00:35:26.06 --> 00:35:29.74
Their head stitcher, I want her to watch the way we sewed.

775
00:35:29.74 --> 00:35:33.06
The way the hands moved so that she could feel confident

776
00:35:33.06 --> 00:35:34.34
in the same thing.

777
00:35:34.34 --> 00:35:38.06
That, you know, we're, we are who they are.

778
00:35:38.06 --> 00:35:39.82
We're not just Yankees.

779
00:35:39.82 --> 00:35:43.86
We are people who are trying to rebuild the middle class

780
00:35:43.86 --> 00:35:47.50
who are retraining and bringing this thing back.

781
00:35:47.50 --> 00:35:50.10
The same thing they've been doing for 30, 40 years.

782
00:35:50.98 --> 00:35:54.78
Luckily, they agreed to it and we made that shit happen.

783
00:35:54.78 --> 00:35:56.74
Was there a turning point that you saw?

784
00:35:56.74 --> 00:36:01.06
Was there a moment or was it a gradual swaying

785
00:36:01.06 --> 00:36:03.02
of the mindset?

786
00:36:03.02 --> 00:36:05.94
Well, there was a tricky situation there, right?

787
00:36:05.94 --> 00:36:08.98
He had a couple other partners.

788
00:36:08.98 --> 00:36:13.98
And they had a kind of an aggressive ask initially.

789
00:36:18.10 --> 00:36:20.66
You know, like you said earlier,

790
00:36:20.66 --> 00:36:23.30
I don't have my business degree.

791
00:36:23.30 --> 00:36:26.18
I try to understand people.

792
00:36:26.18 --> 00:36:28.70
I'm pretty transparent in negotiation.

793
00:36:28.70 --> 00:36:31.78
Like I wear my heart on my sleeve.

794
00:36:31.78 --> 00:36:33.02
I'm not hiding anything.

795
00:36:33.02 --> 00:36:35.66
And I explained to him in their first ask,

796
00:36:35.66 --> 00:36:38.74
I was like, yeah, it's just not, we're just not there.

797
00:36:38.74 --> 00:36:39.78
Like we're just not there.

798
00:36:39.78 --> 00:36:41.82
Like here's the value of what we're gonna do.

799
00:36:41.82 --> 00:36:44.66
Cause we're not gonna buy this business

800
00:36:44.66 --> 00:36:47.98
as a business entity and keep like just running

801
00:36:47.98 --> 00:36:49.46
the same way with the same accounts.

802
00:36:49.46 --> 00:36:52.90
We're gonna buy this as an extension of Origin.

803
00:36:52.90 --> 00:36:55.34
That it's gonna be a, it's gonna be a production facility

804
00:36:55.34 --> 00:36:56.90
ultimately for Origin.

805
00:36:56.90 --> 00:36:59.74
So the revenue doesn't really matter.

806
00:36:59.74 --> 00:37:03.22
What's important is you have 120 people

807
00:37:03.22 --> 00:37:06.90
who know how to make badass shit, badass durable shit.

808
00:37:06.90 --> 00:37:08.86
And you have the machines to do so.

809
00:37:08.86 --> 00:37:11.62
So the value is in the people cause you can buy machines.

810
00:37:11.62 --> 00:37:13.38
So you're buying people.

811
00:37:13.38 --> 00:37:14.50
You're buying a skill set.

812
00:37:14.50 --> 00:37:16.46
You're buying a capability.

813
00:37:16.46 --> 00:37:20.06
And to try to, to try to ramp up 120 people

814
00:37:20.06 --> 00:37:22.98
and turn that on, we've already done it.

815
00:37:22.98 --> 00:37:27.50
It took, it took freaking a decade to do the same thing.

816
00:37:27.50 --> 00:37:28.82
We don't have a decade.

817
00:37:28.82 --> 00:37:30.06
So we got to buy capacity.

818
00:37:30.06 --> 00:37:30.98
So we're buying capacity.

819
00:37:30.98 --> 00:37:33.42
I explained that to him, unpacked that for him.

820
00:37:33.42 --> 00:37:37.30
And ultimately we came to agreement and, you know,

821
00:37:37.30 --> 00:37:39.66
when you, when, when you talk about like putting money

822
00:37:39.66 --> 00:37:42.34
where your mouth is like me, you and Deco stroke to check

823
00:37:42.34 --> 00:37:43.30
and bought that place.

824
00:37:43.30 --> 00:37:46.70
Like that's like, we're talking about where reinvesting

825
00:37:46.70 --> 00:37:49.18
in America's communities.

826
00:37:49.18 --> 00:37:51.18
That wasn't a bank loan on that one.

827
00:37:51.18 --> 00:37:52.46
We wrote a check.

828
00:37:52.46 --> 00:37:57.46
And I think that that was also meaningful to them knowing,

829
00:37:57.46 --> 00:37:59.26
yeah, we got to go finance this thing.

830
00:37:59.26 --> 00:38:01.34
Like we're not a hedge fund coming in.

831
00:38:01.34 --> 00:38:03.70
You know, we're not corporate raiders coming in.

832
00:38:03.70 --> 00:38:06.54
You know, we're, we're actually investing in this personally.

833
00:38:06.54 --> 00:38:09.54
Our families are investing in what your family has built.

834
00:38:10.74 --> 00:38:13.50
Pushed them over, got the deal done.

835
00:38:13.50 --> 00:38:16.26
And, you know, we're high fiving.

836
00:38:16.26 --> 00:38:19.58
We just added 120 people who know how to build bad ass shit,

837
00:38:19.58 --> 00:38:21.98
but it still wasn't enough.

838
00:38:21.98 --> 00:38:22.82
Yeah.

839
00:38:22.82 --> 00:38:25.70
And in the meantime, you know, we kind of breezed through the,

840
00:38:25.70 --> 00:38:29.82
the getting the partnership with good partners.

841
00:38:31.54 --> 00:38:35.10
One thing that was interesting about that was

842
00:38:35.10 --> 00:38:38.34
a lot of the stuff that I think would make a lot of companies

843
00:38:39.58 --> 00:38:40.82
really sweat and have to work.

844
00:38:40.82 --> 00:38:44.26
Like for instance, you know, our financials, right?

845
00:38:44.26 --> 00:38:47.98
So Don, our CFO, he's been here.

846
00:38:47.98 --> 00:38:51.02
And he, we were so dialed in, you know,

847
00:38:51.02 --> 00:38:55.46
despite all the overwork that he had done, you know,

848
00:38:55.46 --> 00:38:58.50
by himself much of the time, a lot of times.

849
00:38:58.50 --> 00:39:01.06
And look, luckily for me on the Eshalon front side,

850
00:39:01.06 --> 00:39:04.86
I'm, I'm party to a lot of these deals.

851
00:39:04.86 --> 00:39:07.58
You know, I see a lot of PEs come in.

852
00:39:07.58 --> 00:39:08.86
I watch these deals happen.

853
00:39:08.86 --> 00:39:10.18
I'm part of these deals sometimes.

854
00:39:10.18 --> 00:39:13.90
So I've seen a lot of this and it was awesome

855
00:39:13.90 --> 00:39:16.34
because sometimes, you know, you start asking

856
00:39:16.34 --> 00:39:19.58
when they start doing the financial due due diligence,

857
00:39:19.58 --> 00:39:21.98
you know, it's, it's like opening up a can of worms

858
00:39:21.98 --> 00:39:24.22
and mayhem's coming out and it gets crazy.

859
00:39:24.22 --> 00:39:26.26
And it was awesome to,

860
00:39:26.26 --> 00:39:27.74
and I remember you and I having this conversation, you know,

861
00:39:27.74 --> 00:39:29.10
like, hey, you know, I said,

862
00:39:29.10 --> 00:39:31.02
what are we looking like from the financial side?

863
00:39:31.02 --> 00:39:32.18
Is there a role in this due diligence?

864
00:39:32.18 --> 00:39:33.02
How long do you think it's gonna take?

865
00:39:33.02 --> 00:39:34.58
And you're like, hey, man, you know the deal.

866
00:39:34.58 --> 00:39:36.18
Like we, it's not gonna take long.

867
00:39:36.18 --> 00:39:38.82
And there's, it's all just good to go.

868
00:39:38.82 --> 00:39:42.30
And so I thought that that was pretty awesome,

869
00:39:42.30 --> 00:39:46.98
especially considering such a small team of one

870
00:39:46.98 --> 00:39:50.26
much of the time, you know, of just Don being that squared

871
00:39:50.26 --> 00:39:55.26
way and, and he had done a lot to prepare us for that.

872
00:39:56.62 --> 00:39:59.82
So that was, that was pretty awesome.

873
00:39:59.82 --> 00:40:03.26
And finding those guys, you know,

874
00:40:03.26 --> 00:40:06.30
I'd say that if people aren't aligned,

875
00:40:06.30 --> 00:40:08.42
though the one, the one time that you're gonna have a failure

876
00:40:08.42 --> 00:40:11.18
is if we aren't aligned, if two people aren't aligned

877
00:40:11.18 --> 00:40:13.18
or if two teams aren't aligned, you're gonna have,

878
00:40:13.18 --> 00:40:14.98
you're gonna ultimately have failure.

879
00:40:14.98 --> 00:40:18.46
Cause you can't be going to two different places.

880
00:40:18.46 --> 00:40:20.42
You have to be going to the same place.

881
00:40:20.42 --> 00:40:22.02
If you can't break the laws of physics

882
00:40:22.02 --> 00:40:23.06
and go to two different places,

883
00:40:23.06 --> 00:40:25.50
you can't rip bodies apart, it doesn't work.

884
00:40:25.50 --> 00:40:28.58
And so luckily with good partners, you know,

885
00:40:28.58 --> 00:40:32.10
they had, they had built Supreme,

886
00:40:32.10 --> 00:40:36.74
they'd built Skullcandy, they got some newer companies.

887
00:40:36.74 --> 00:40:40.30
Yeah, Dave, they got Hook, the H UK Hook performance

888
00:40:40.30 --> 00:40:43.86
fishing like really great companies that are cool.

889
00:40:44.94 --> 00:40:46.86
And so they had experience with this stuff.

890
00:40:46.86 --> 00:40:48.38
And they were able to address things

891
00:40:48.38 --> 00:40:50.34
with us and talk about where we wanted to go.

892
00:40:50.34 --> 00:40:52.26
And what, you know, here's,

893
00:40:52.26 --> 00:40:55.10
here's something that was tricky.

894
00:40:55.10 --> 00:40:59.90
I was tricky because I don't like to lock things in

895
00:40:59.90 --> 00:41:01.54
cause I don't know what the future holds.

896
00:41:01.54 --> 00:41:02.70
I'd give this advice all the time,

897
00:41:02.70 --> 00:41:03.90
hey, you don't know what the future is gonna hold.

898
00:41:03.90 --> 00:41:05.66
So why are you locking in this or that?

899
00:41:05.66 --> 00:41:08.22
And so the way we set things up

900
00:41:08.22 --> 00:41:10.78
and the way they worked with us was like,

901
00:41:10.78 --> 00:41:12.30
oh, we have all kinds of options.

902
00:41:12.30 --> 00:41:13.98
We have all kinds of directions to go into.

903
00:41:13.98 --> 00:41:15.62
There's no doors closed.

904
00:41:15.62 --> 00:41:16.46
So that was great.

905
00:41:16.46 --> 00:41:17.42
How flexible they were.

906
00:41:17.42 --> 00:41:18.74
They were patient as hell.

907
00:41:18.74 --> 00:41:19.74
Yeah, they were patient.

908
00:41:19.74 --> 00:41:20.58
They were patient as hell.

909
00:41:20.58 --> 00:41:22.54
Bro, at some point, sometimes like I,

910
00:41:22.54 --> 00:41:25.14
my ass was stuck to my couch, you know,

911
00:41:25.14 --> 00:41:27.42
and I would be like on the phone, on the phone,

912
00:41:27.42 --> 00:41:29.74
on the phone, on the phone, like till midnight.

913
00:41:29.74 --> 00:41:32.30
It was, honestly, it was like a,

914
00:41:34.18 --> 00:41:38.42
this kind of, this, I don't know the word for it,

915
00:41:38.42 --> 00:41:41.74
this constant alignment.

916
00:41:41.74 --> 00:41:44.42
Constant alignment and having the right,

917
00:41:44.42 --> 00:41:46.74
like the right words, you know what I mean?

918
00:41:46.74 --> 00:41:49.34
And sometimes those words were tricky to,

919
00:41:50.54 --> 00:41:52.34
yeah, tricky, tricky.

920
00:41:52.34 --> 00:41:53.62
Here's something else that was cool.

921
00:41:53.62 --> 00:41:55.70
And it's a good, this is a good,

922
00:41:55.70 --> 00:41:59.22
this is a good lesson learned for anybody that's out there.

923
00:41:59.22 --> 00:42:00.70
Lawyers talking to each other.

924
00:42:00.70 --> 00:42:01.54
Suck.

925
00:42:01.54 --> 00:42:03.42
Is different than two people talking to each other.

926
00:42:03.42 --> 00:42:04.26
Yes.

927
00:42:04.26 --> 00:42:07.30
So I remember we were, you know,

928
00:42:07.30 --> 00:42:10.38
we'd hit a little bit of a, let's say a little,

929
00:42:11.86 --> 00:42:13.62
a little hesitation, right?

930
00:42:13.62 --> 00:42:15.14
I was a little bit hesitant.

931
00:42:15.14 --> 00:42:16.02
It sounded like they,

932
00:42:16.02 --> 00:42:19.38
and so my lawyers are telling me that they're saying this

933
00:42:19.38 --> 00:42:21.10
and their lawyers are telling their crew

934
00:42:21.10 --> 00:42:22.34
that I'm saying this.

935
00:42:22.34 --> 00:42:26.58
And finally, I'm like, dude, give me Dave's number.

936
00:42:26.58 --> 00:42:28.02
And like, we just got on the phone

937
00:42:28.02 --> 00:42:29.30
and I'm like, hey, this is what I'm worried about.

938
00:42:29.30 --> 00:42:30.50
And he goes, yeah, we can handle that.

939
00:42:30.50 --> 00:42:31.34
That's no factor.

940
00:42:31.34 --> 00:42:33.10
I don't want it, you know, that doesn't make a difference.

941
00:42:33.10 --> 00:42:34.18
Okay, cool, great.

942
00:42:34.18 --> 00:42:35.02
Write it up like this.

943
00:42:35.02 --> 00:42:36.18
He's like, cool, I got it.

944
00:42:36.18 --> 00:42:38.66
He said, hey, but Jocko, you gotta give me this over here.

945
00:42:38.66 --> 00:42:40.06
And I'm like, oh yeah, that totally makes sense.

946
00:42:40.06 --> 00:42:41.18
I don't, you know, you're not gonna,

947
00:42:41.18 --> 00:42:43.02
you're not gonna give us money

948
00:42:43.02 --> 00:42:45.50
if you don't have this type of thing.

949
00:42:45.50 --> 00:42:49.94
So once he and I talked person to person, man to man,

950
00:42:49.94 --> 00:42:52.58
and just, oh yeah, hey man, okay, cool.

951
00:42:53.66 --> 00:42:55.58
From there, it was like everything was fine.

952
00:42:55.58 --> 00:42:57.26
But there was, getting to that-

953
00:42:57.26 --> 00:42:59.22
That whole time though, that monster kept eating.

954
00:42:59.22 --> 00:43:00.86
Oh, it kept eating, dude.

955
00:43:00.86 --> 00:43:03.54
It was eating everything in sight.

956
00:43:03.54 --> 00:43:06.90
And you know, I, you know, you were sweating.

957
00:43:06.90 --> 00:43:08.06
Yeah, oh yeah, I was definitely sweating.

958
00:43:08.06 --> 00:43:08.90
You were sweating.

959
00:43:08.90 --> 00:43:13.30
And you'd talk to me like, bro, you're trying to like,

960
00:43:13.30 --> 00:43:15.34
talk to both sets of lawyers.

961
00:43:15.34 --> 00:43:16.90
And I'm like, bro, let me talk to Dave.

962
00:43:16.90 --> 00:43:17.74
Let's get this thing.

963
00:43:17.74 --> 00:43:22.74
And so luckily, you know, when you talk and you're aligned,

964
00:43:24.06 --> 00:43:24.90
then it's easy.

965
00:43:24.90 --> 00:43:26.38
And look, look, hey, this is another thing I remember.

966
00:43:26.38 --> 00:43:27.62
When you, when someone else is,

967
00:43:27.62 --> 00:43:31.38
when the opposing lawyer is looking out for them

968
00:43:31.38 --> 00:43:33.38
and your lawyer's looking out for you,

969
00:43:33.38 --> 00:43:35.58
they're not, they're not trying to go to the same place.

970
00:43:35.58 --> 00:43:36.42
No.

971
00:43:36.42 --> 00:43:37.82
They're trying to go to two different places.

972
00:43:37.82 --> 00:43:39.58
So they're gonna have a hard time.

973
00:43:39.58 --> 00:43:42.10
So you have to have sometimes conversations.

974
00:43:42.10 --> 00:43:43.82
And those conversations need to be backed up in writing.

975
00:43:43.82 --> 00:43:44.66
Of course, that's why.

976
00:43:44.66 --> 00:43:46.86
So you can then debrief the lawyers

977
00:43:46.86 --> 00:43:49.42
and the lawyers understand where you need to be.

978
00:43:49.42 --> 00:43:51.62
And that both sides have agreed.

979
00:43:51.62 --> 00:43:54.94
So that's something to remember.

980
00:43:54.94 --> 00:43:57.82
And here's another, you know,

981
00:43:57.82 --> 00:44:00.66
you and I never freaking had lawyers in between us.

982
00:44:00.66 --> 00:44:01.50
You know what I mean?

983
00:44:01.50 --> 00:44:02.34
No, we didn't.

984
00:44:02.34 --> 00:44:03.82
And the other funny thing I was telling people

985
00:44:03.82 --> 00:44:05.54
to say the other day is we never had,

986
00:44:05.54 --> 00:44:10.42
we were on a handshake for years, on a handshake.

987
00:44:10.42 --> 00:44:14.06
Millions and millions of dollars worth of business.

988
00:44:14.06 --> 00:44:14.90
Tens of millions of dollars.

989
00:44:14.90 --> 00:44:16.30
Tens of millions of dollars worth of business

990
00:44:16.30 --> 00:44:17.34
on a handshake.

991
00:44:17.34 --> 00:44:19.62
On a handshake.

992
00:44:19.62 --> 00:44:20.46
That's legit.

993
00:44:20.46 --> 00:44:21.30
Which is freaking awesome.

994
00:44:21.30 --> 00:44:23.82
Like Old School, I hope people can learn from that.

995
00:44:23.82 --> 00:44:26.42
And by the way, the only reason we eventually were like,

996
00:44:26.42 --> 00:44:28.78
okay, we need to go to paper on this stuff

997
00:44:28.78 --> 00:44:30.86
is because the banks and the lawyers were like,

998
00:44:30.86 --> 00:44:32.50
hey, guys.

999
00:44:32.50 --> 00:44:33.34
This thing's too big.

1000
00:44:33.34 --> 00:44:34.18
This doesn't work.

1001
00:44:34.18 --> 00:44:35.66
You can't have a handshake.

1002
00:44:35.66 --> 00:44:38.58
Like if one of you dies, if one of you dies,

1003
00:44:38.58 --> 00:44:41.50
this is a freaking disaster for all involved.

1004
00:44:41.50 --> 00:44:43.02
And we're like, all right, fine.

1005
00:44:43.02 --> 00:44:44.58
So we did it.

1006
00:44:44.58 --> 00:44:48.06
But that was great.

1007
00:44:48.06 --> 00:44:51.06
I was definitely like sweating it.

1008
00:44:51.06 --> 00:44:53.82
And I'll tell you what, I gotta give Kip props on it

1009
00:44:53.82 --> 00:44:56.82
because he kept telling me, Pete,

1010
00:44:56.82 --> 00:44:58.54
you gotta understand something.

1011
00:44:58.54 --> 00:45:02.34
All big fish are lost at the boat.

1012
00:45:02.34 --> 00:45:05.14
You can reel and reel and reel and reel and reel

1013
00:45:05.14 --> 00:45:08.14
and you go to grab that gill and pull that hook

1014
00:45:08.14 --> 00:45:09.26
and you lose it.

1015
00:45:09.26 --> 00:45:10.10
You know what I mean?

1016
00:45:10.10 --> 00:45:11.22
Like you get it right to the boat

1017
00:45:11.22 --> 00:45:14.22
and it flaps its tail and rips off.

1018
00:45:14.22 --> 00:45:18.98
And we were at tail flapping kind of scenario at that point.

1019
00:45:18.98 --> 00:45:21.22
And I'm trying to hang onto the freaking gill.

1020
00:45:21.22 --> 00:45:22.66
You know what I mean?

1021
00:45:22.66 --> 00:45:26.74
Like trying to grab the club to kill this thing.

1022
00:45:26.74 --> 00:45:31.54
But it was ultimately, I think that they were

1023
00:45:32.50 --> 00:45:34.14
definitely not only the right partner,

1024
00:45:34.14 --> 00:45:36.30
but the patient partner we need.

1025
00:45:36.30 --> 00:45:41.30
You know, that was a nice, let's say,

1026
00:45:42.30 --> 00:45:44.74
it proved to me as they were waiting.

1027
00:45:44.74 --> 00:45:46.18
You know, they're like, okay.

1028
00:45:47.10 --> 00:45:48.86
They didn't freak out.

1029
00:45:48.86 --> 00:45:50.62
They didn't get crazy.

1030
00:45:50.62 --> 00:45:51.78
They were like, oh, they were like,

1031
00:45:51.78 --> 00:45:54.02
oh, it's gonna take some time to get this thing worked out.

1032
00:45:54.02 --> 00:45:58.10
You know, it's like, oh, she doesn't wanna marry me right now.

1033
00:45:58.10 --> 00:45:58.94
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1034
00:45:58.94 --> 00:46:00.46
No, it's like she wants to wait another year.

1035
00:46:00.46 --> 00:46:03.02
And most private equity firms would not have done that.

1036
00:46:03.02 --> 00:46:03.86
Yeah, yeah.

1037
00:46:03.86 --> 00:46:05.78
So they were super cool and proved

1038
00:46:05.78 --> 00:46:08.42
the type of people that they were through their actions,

1039
00:46:08.42 --> 00:46:10.10
which was legit.

1040
00:46:10.10 --> 00:46:15.10
And so that worked out great and has been great.

1041
00:46:16.30 --> 00:46:18.98
In the meantime, right?

1042
00:46:18.98 --> 00:46:22.26
We get, how long was it?

1043
00:46:22.26 --> 00:46:24.82
Once we had the factory in North Carolina,

1044
00:46:24.82 --> 00:46:25.90
the first factory in North Carolina.

1045
00:46:25.90 --> 00:46:26.74
October.

1046
00:46:26.74 --> 00:46:27.86
Factory one, we get that in October.

1047
00:46:27.86 --> 00:46:29.34
So just after we recorded the last podcast,

1048
00:46:29.34 --> 00:46:30.18
we closed on that first.

1049
00:46:30.18 --> 00:46:31.18
We closed on it.

1050
00:46:31.18 --> 00:46:33.46
So we're stoked.

1051
00:46:33.46 --> 00:46:36.82
How long did the Stoke last before you started,

1052
00:46:36.82 --> 00:46:39.90
you started to hear hunger growls from the monster again?

1053
00:46:39.90 --> 00:46:40.74
One month.

1054
00:46:40.74 --> 00:46:41.82
It was one month?

1055
00:46:41.82 --> 00:46:44.38
Yeah, because we launched November.

1056
00:46:44.38 --> 00:46:46.06
We launched our Black Friday.

1057
00:46:46.06 --> 00:46:48.90
We do that like one deal a year.

1058
00:46:48.90 --> 00:46:53.82
And bro, we sold like 10,000 pairs of jeans.

1059
00:46:53.82 --> 00:46:56.10
We had to close it off and like,

1060
00:46:56.10 --> 00:46:57.82
I don't know, a thousand, two thousand pairs of boots.

1061
00:46:57.82 --> 00:46:58.90
And I'm looking at it.

1062
00:46:58.90 --> 00:47:02.06
I remember you texting me like, we're shutting it down.

1063
00:47:02.06 --> 00:47:07.06
And that's when I was like, okay, that always sucks, bro.

1064
00:47:07.54 --> 00:47:09.90
Cause what that means is someone out there

1065
00:47:09.90 --> 00:47:11.94
is gonna have to buy a pair of jeans

1066
00:47:11.94 --> 00:47:14.10
that are made in another country.

1067
00:47:14.10 --> 00:47:15.70
And that's horrible.

1068
00:47:15.70 --> 00:47:17.02
It's horrible for America.

1069
00:47:17.02 --> 00:47:18.14
It's horrible for our economy.

1070
00:47:18.14 --> 00:47:19.18
It's horrible for our community.

1071
00:47:19.18 --> 00:47:20.78
It's horrible for the person that has to wear

1072
00:47:20.78 --> 00:47:23.46
substandard jeans on their body.

1073
00:47:23.46 --> 00:47:28.46
And yet, I remember, hey, we have to shut this down

1074
00:47:29.06 --> 00:47:31.18
right now and I'm thinking, damn.

1075
00:47:31.18 --> 00:47:35.30
The immediate pivot was, I remember sitting down

1076
00:47:35.30 --> 00:47:38.74
the day, the next business day after Black Friday

1077
00:47:38.74 --> 00:47:41.38
with the team and saying, what are we gonna do?

1078
00:47:41.38 --> 00:47:42.98
How are we gonna pivot?

1079
00:47:42.98 --> 00:47:44.62
And we got Jason on the phone,

1080
00:47:44.62 --> 00:47:46.82
our new partner down in North Carolina,

1081
00:47:46.82 --> 00:47:49.78
running all of North Carolina operations.

1082
00:47:49.78 --> 00:47:54.22
Then I said, hey bro, I think we can make jeans there.

1083
00:47:54.22 --> 00:47:55.06
Remember this?

1084
00:47:55.06 --> 00:47:55.90
Yeah.

1085
00:47:55.90 --> 00:47:59.98
And I'm like, I think we can,

1086
00:47:59.98 --> 00:48:01.78
but these machines are completely different,

1087
00:48:01.78 --> 00:48:03.000
fouling machines.

1088
00:48:03.98 --> 00:48:05.34
He's like, yeah, we can get it done.

1089
00:48:05.34 --> 00:48:06.58
We can get it done.

1090
00:48:06.58 --> 00:48:09.98
And immediately, and I think that's the great thing

1091
00:48:09.98 --> 00:48:13.34
with obviously owning your supply chain.

1092
00:48:13.34 --> 00:48:16.74
I like to call it the Origin Factory Blockchain.

1093
00:48:16.74 --> 00:48:19.78
I use the word blockchain because people understand

1094
00:48:19.78 --> 00:48:21.70
what a blockchain is these days.

1095
00:48:21.70 --> 00:48:24.14
Well, the Origin Factory Blockchain is a blockchain

1096
00:48:24.14 --> 00:48:26.18
of manufacturing and transparency

1097
00:48:26.18 --> 00:48:29.14
where you can trust where everything comes from.

1098
00:48:29.14 --> 00:48:30.90
You know that cotton's come from Texas.

1099
00:48:30.90 --> 00:48:32.86
You know that thing's woven in Triangle Georgia.

1100
00:48:32.86 --> 00:48:34.90
You know it's getting cotton sown in North Carolina

1101
00:48:34.90 --> 00:48:37.86
in Maine and it's a blockchain of manufacturing,

1102
00:48:37.86 --> 00:48:39.22
which is really powerful.

1103
00:48:39.22 --> 00:48:41.02
And it's actually core to who we are

1104
00:48:41.02 --> 00:48:41.94
and core to our story,

1105
00:48:41.94 --> 00:48:43.26
because we got nothing to hide.

1106
00:48:43.26 --> 00:48:45.70
We ain't cutting out tags, right?

1107
00:48:45.70 --> 00:48:48.34
We're making the shit from scratch.

1108
00:48:48.34 --> 00:48:52.90
And we actually put out there to the public,

1109
00:48:52.90 --> 00:48:56.02
like we're gonna have to make jeans in North Carolina

1110
00:48:56.02 --> 00:48:58.14
and watch us pivot.

1111
00:48:58.14 --> 00:49:01.30
And also follow us as we make mistakes,

1112
00:49:01.30 --> 00:49:02.78
you know, and make tuition payments.

1113
00:49:02.78 --> 00:49:06.06
But that mechanic that we flew up to Maine

1114
00:49:07.02 --> 00:49:09.34
used to work in a denim factory.

1115
00:49:09.34 --> 00:49:11.50
And he knew how to set up the machines down there

1116
00:49:11.50 --> 00:49:13.18
and he knew how to tune them in.

1117
00:49:13.18 --> 00:49:16.82
And he had all the beautiful tooling made.

1118
00:49:16.82 --> 00:49:19.46
It was actually, it was so good.

1119
00:49:19.46 --> 00:49:20.82
He made more and sent it to Maine

1120
00:49:20.82 --> 00:49:22.18
so we could use it in Maine.

1121
00:49:22.18 --> 00:49:23.50
So we made the pivot.

1122
00:49:23.50 --> 00:49:25.38
It wasn't easy, but we got it done.

1123
00:49:25.38 --> 00:49:28.70
And we're still not producing enough.

1124
00:49:28.70 --> 00:49:33.70
And I remember saying to, I don't know if I called you,

1125
00:49:34.54 --> 00:49:37.46
while we were down there getting to know the area,

1126
00:49:37.46 --> 00:49:39.30
this is Ashboro, North Carolina,

1127
00:49:40.30 --> 00:49:45.30
I drove by a building and it said on a trailer

1128
00:49:45.38 --> 00:49:48.10
outside of the building, it said Texas jeans on it.

1129
00:49:50.50 --> 00:49:53.30
And I remember just asking Jason, like, what is that?

1130
00:49:53.30 --> 00:49:56.78
And he was like, oh, that's this old guy, Wally.

1131
00:49:56.78 --> 00:50:00.86
And he's been in the denim business for ever.

1132
00:50:01.90 --> 00:50:03.90
Come to find out and I didn't know this.

1133
00:50:03.90 --> 00:50:05.82
I learned that North Carolina

1134
00:50:05.82 --> 00:50:08.46
was the denim capital of America.

1135
00:50:08.46 --> 00:50:11.78
And I'm like, so he's got like denim machines

1136
00:50:11.78 --> 00:50:14.06
and people making jeans in there and everything.

1137
00:50:14.06 --> 00:50:18.42
He's like, yeah, so again, another situation.

1138
00:50:18.42 --> 00:50:20.54
We leaned into it a little bit,

1139
00:50:20.54 --> 00:50:23.86
literally knocked on the door, went in

1140
00:50:23.86 --> 00:50:27.70
and started having a conversation.

1141
00:50:27.70 --> 00:50:30.18
It all started with a conversation.

1142
00:50:30.18 --> 00:50:33.22
I know when you're talking about going back to factory one,

1143
00:50:33.22 --> 00:50:36.18
Jason Gatti, all right, you got this guy.

1144
00:50:36.18 --> 00:50:39.50
I just want to kind of profile him just for a minute.

1145
00:50:39.50 --> 00:50:41.86
Did you see a transition in his,

1146
00:50:42.94 --> 00:50:47.30
because look, the only Jason I've known is 100%.

1147
00:50:47.30 --> 00:50:49.66
Let's make some shit happen now.

1148
00:50:49.66 --> 00:50:51.78
We got this, here's what we need to do.

1149
00:50:51.78 --> 00:50:53.22
That's the only Jason I know.

1150
00:50:53.22 --> 00:50:54.54
Was that the only Jason you know?

1151
00:50:54.54 --> 00:50:56.78
Was that a turnaround?

1152
00:50:56.78 --> 00:50:58.34
Was there a turning point for him

1153
00:50:58.34 --> 00:51:02.70
where he realized that this was the right thing to do?

1154
00:51:02.70 --> 00:51:06.14
Because I mean, like I said, I've seen nothing but Jason,

1155
00:51:06.14 --> 00:51:10.90
nothing from Jason except for like a 100%

1156
00:51:10.90 --> 00:51:13.66
positive awesome attitude to make things happen.

1157
00:51:13.66 --> 00:51:16.50
And also be like, no, hey, we're not gonna be able to do that.

1158
00:51:16.50 --> 00:51:18.34
Or if we're gonna do that, here's what we're gonna need.

1159
00:51:18.34 --> 00:51:19.86
Like that kind of thing.

1160
00:51:19.86 --> 00:51:21.98
Was he like that the whole time?

1161
00:51:21.98 --> 00:51:26.98
I would say his level of positivity was always consistent.

1162
00:51:26.98 --> 00:51:27.82
Nice.

1163
00:51:27.82 --> 00:51:29.74
And if there was anything he was feeling,

1164
00:51:29.74 --> 00:51:31.46
he definitely didn't show it.

1165
00:51:31.46 --> 00:51:34.54
Now, with that said, we had a lot of private conversations.

1166
00:51:34.54 --> 00:51:36.70
A lot of private conversations.

1167
00:51:36.70 --> 00:51:40.46
He educated me on the way they survived over the past 30 years.

1168
00:51:40.46 --> 00:51:43.66
He educated me on the restructuring they had to go through,

1169
00:51:43.66 --> 00:51:46.54
with the banks coming in and pulling apart the company

1170
00:51:46.54 --> 00:51:50.06
and putting it back together and putting a CEO in place

1171
00:51:50.06 --> 00:51:50.82
and how he fell.

1172
00:51:50.82 --> 00:51:54.14
And like they went through some shit, man.

1173
00:51:54.14 --> 00:51:56.26
Like after NAFTA and the WTO,

1174
00:51:56.26 --> 00:51:57.90
like they went through some serious shit

1175
00:51:57.90 --> 00:51:59.26
and he was part of it.

1176
00:51:59.26 --> 00:52:03.26
So there's this protective kind of defense mechanism there

1177
00:52:03.26 --> 00:52:07.98
that he's looking out for his people.

1178
00:52:07.98 --> 00:52:12.98
And again, regardless of this new found relationship

1179
00:52:12.98 --> 00:52:17.98
and working towards this kind of new culture,

1180
00:52:18.30 --> 00:52:21.18
you're still blending two cultures together

1181
00:52:21.18 --> 00:52:22.86
and two companies together.

1182
00:52:22.86 --> 00:52:26.54
So there was definitely some apprehension behind the scenes

1183
00:52:26.54 --> 00:52:29.38
and we had lots and lots of in-depth conversations.

1184
00:52:29.38 --> 00:52:31.62
Some intense conversations too.

1185
00:52:31.62 --> 00:52:36.62
The good thing with him is like he's a type of guy

1186
00:52:36.62 --> 00:52:38.98
and maybe at some point it'd be good to have him on podcast

1187
00:52:38.98 --> 00:52:41.86
but he's the type of guy that he's a survivor.

1188
00:52:41.86 --> 00:52:43.34
He's a survivor, man.

1189
00:52:43.34 --> 00:52:45.30
I was gonna throw that out.

1190
00:52:45.30 --> 00:52:46.66
You talk about all these restructurings

1191
00:52:46.66 --> 00:52:48.10
and all these things going on and putting a new,

1192
00:52:48.10 --> 00:52:49.66
and he's the guy that's there.

1193
00:52:49.66 --> 00:52:52.50
He's there and he's been through some shit in his life

1194
00:52:52.50 --> 00:52:56.06
and he's a survivor.

1195
00:52:56.06 --> 00:53:01.06
So it's tough when you have built something for so long

1196
00:53:05.26 --> 00:53:08.34
to then I'm just gonna say abandon it.

1197
00:53:08.34 --> 00:53:12.46
You've been building this thing for 20, 30 years

1198
00:53:12.46 --> 00:53:16.58
and some freaking Yankee is coming down,

1199
00:53:16.58 --> 00:53:18.42
asking you to abandon it.

1200
00:53:19.34 --> 00:53:21.90
Cause that's ultimately the end goal, right?

1201
00:53:21.90 --> 00:53:25.26
Is you're gonna abandon this and you're gonna,

1202
00:53:25.26 --> 00:53:28.54
and I'm asking you to fully buy into what we're doing.

1203
00:53:28.54 --> 00:53:31.42
Unproven, completely unproven.

1204
00:53:31.42 --> 00:53:33.42
Just from watching some freaking YouTube videos

1205
00:53:33.42 --> 00:53:36.26
and knowing, you know, Jocko's my other partner.

1206
00:53:36.26 --> 00:53:40.82
It's still, even though you can buy into that

1207
00:53:40.82 --> 00:53:43.74
and you can trust it, your livelihood

1208
00:53:43.74 --> 00:53:45.86
and all these people's livelihood,

1209
00:53:45.86 --> 00:53:49.78
you're betting that we're gonna do the right thing

1210
00:53:49.78 --> 00:53:52.62
without that trust and that bond being built.

1211
00:53:52.62 --> 00:53:54.66
So, yeah.

1212
00:53:54.66 --> 00:53:57.10
Another comment I make a lot when I'm working

1213
00:53:57.10 --> 00:53:59.50
with companies is, you know, they say,

1214
00:53:59.50 --> 00:54:01.10
well, you know, you guys win the SEAL teams

1215
00:54:01.10 --> 00:54:02.62
and you're dealing with life, life and death

1216
00:54:02.62 --> 00:54:03.78
and be dealing with people's lives.

1217
00:54:03.78 --> 00:54:06.46
I always say, you know, we dealt with people's lives,

1218
00:54:06.46 --> 00:54:08.26
you deal with people's livelihoods.

1219
00:54:08.26 --> 00:54:09.90
And that's the thing about Jason,

1220
00:54:09.90 --> 00:54:12.82
you could tell that total positive attitude,

1221
00:54:12.82 --> 00:54:17.82
you could also see that family attitude towards his people,

1222
00:54:20.38 --> 00:54:22.90
that he wanted to take care of his people.

1223
00:54:22.90 --> 00:54:25.02
Like, he needed to survive

1224
00:54:25.02 --> 00:54:27.74
because that meant his people would survive.

1225
00:54:27.74 --> 00:54:29.74
Like you could feel that when you talk to him.

1226
00:54:29.74 --> 00:54:32.74
Yeah, he's intense and, you know, thank God

1227
00:54:32.74 --> 00:54:35.46
he was willing to go to a muster.

1228
00:54:35.46 --> 00:54:38.70
And he went to that muster and it changed his life.

1229
00:54:38.70 --> 00:54:43.54
He literally said, Pete, I have learned more about myself

1230
00:54:43.54 --> 00:54:45.54
and I'm growing every day, man, you know,

1231
00:54:45.54 --> 00:54:47.46
and his thick Southern accent.

1232
00:54:48.86 --> 00:54:51.86
And, you know, J.P. took him under his wing

1233
00:54:51.86 --> 00:54:55.46
and a couple other, you know, the instructors

1234
00:54:55.46 --> 00:54:57.78
and really dug in with him.

1235
00:54:57.78 --> 00:55:02.38
They dug in and kind of, I don't wanna say like remolded

1236
00:55:02.38 --> 00:55:06.86
but remolded the way he thinks and is walking through life

1237
00:55:06.86 --> 00:55:08.66
and thinking about business.

1238
00:55:08.66 --> 00:55:10.78
And that was so important.

1239
00:55:10.78 --> 00:55:13.10
Honestly, if he didn't go to that muster,

1240
00:55:15.26 --> 00:55:19.18
I don't know, I don't know where we would be right now

1241
00:55:19.18 --> 00:55:20.74
if he didn't go to that muster.

1242
00:55:20.74 --> 00:55:22.94
Well, as we get into the next factory,

1243
00:55:22.94 --> 00:55:26.10
you can see, like I would be observing and going,

1244
00:55:26.10 --> 00:55:27.22
oh yeah, he's got this.

1245
00:55:27.22 --> 00:55:29.58
He understood, he understands this part.

1246
00:55:29.58 --> 00:55:30.50
He understands that part.

1247
00:55:30.50 --> 00:55:31.46
He understands this concept.

1248
00:55:31.46 --> 00:55:32.54
He understands that concept.

1249
00:55:32.54 --> 00:55:33.82
You could see that.

1250
00:55:33.82 --> 00:55:35.50
I could see that.

1251
00:55:35.50 --> 00:55:38.46
And believe me, I look at this stuff all day long.

1252
00:55:38.46 --> 00:55:40.50
I look at meetings all day long.

1253
00:55:40.50 --> 00:55:42.30
I sit with companies all day long.

1254
00:55:42.30 --> 00:55:43.98
I sit in boardrooms all day long.

1255
00:55:43.98 --> 00:55:45.14
I go to manufacturing floor.

1256
00:55:45.14 --> 00:55:46.42
This is what I do all day.

1257
00:55:46.42 --> 00:55:47.42
So for me sitting there watching this,

1258
00:55:47.42 --> 00:55:48.70
it's like, oh, okay.

1259
00:55:48.70 --> 00:55:51.14
I can see when people are disconnected.

1260
00:55:51.14 --> 00:55:53.62
I can see when they don't understand what's happening.

1261
00:55:53.62 --> 00:55:56.66
I can see when there's some agendas that they're,

1262
00:55:56.66 --> 00:55:57.70
I can see all that.

1263
00:55:57.70 --> 00:55:59.54
And you didn't see it at all from him.

1264
00:55:59.54 --> 00:56:01.78
I saw that he did.

1265
00:56:01.78 --> 00:56:05.22
And what's cool too is being a survivor.

1266
00:56:05.22 --> 00:56:07.50
We say that as a positive thing, right?

1267
00:56:07.50 --> 00:56:12.38
But we also know that, and just like any other characteristic,

1268
00:56:12.38 --> 00:56:14.14
if someone's a survivor,

1269
00:56:14.14 --> 00:56:17.02
and that's kind of a get in that survivor mode,

1270
00:56:17.02 --> 00:56:18.74
it can be an absolute negative

1271
00:56:18.74 --> 00:56:19.98
because they're trying to survive

1272
00:56:19.98 --> 00:56:20.78
and they're not trying to grow

1273
00:56:20.78 --> 00:56:24.06
and they're not trying to thrive, which is problematic.

1274
00:56:24.06 --> 00:56:27.06
And so I think that transition from him just going,

1275
00:56:27.06 --> 00:56:28.74
hey, I'm just gonna make sure I take care

1276
00:56:28.74 --> 00:56:31.78
of what I've got right now into a growth mindset

1277
00:56:31.78 --> 00:56:33.94
and a thrive mindset of, oh,

1278
00:56:33.94 --> 00:56:36.66
we can actually not just survive,

1279
00:56:36.66 --> 00:56:41.22
but actually grow and take over and crush.

1280
00:56:41.22 --> 00:56:43.70
I think that was a pretty awesome transition

1281
00:56:43.70 --> 00:56:45.18
for Jason Gattie to make.

1282
00:56:45.18 --> 00:56:46.78
Yeah, it was, it was.

1283
00:56:46.78 --> 00:56:49.86
So now you're driving around Ashboro, North Carolina.

1284
00:56:50.90 --> 00:56:52.02
Shout out.

1285
00:56:52.02 --> 00:56:54.22
And you drive by this building.

1286
00:56:54.22 --> 00:56:56.62
And you see a trailer sitting on,

1287
00:56:56.62 --> 00:56:58.38
by the way, it's a big building.

1288
00:56:58.38 --> 00:57:01.54
It's a huge building, but it's very nondescript.

1289
00:57:01.54 --> 00:57:03.10
Yeah, it's nondescript.

1290
00:57:03.10 --> 00:57:05.58
It's got this trailer with the Texas Jains.

1291
00:57:05.58 --> 00:57:08.30
And just in terms of timeline here,

1292
00:57:09.34 --> 00:57:14.34
like I had seen this building during the deal making

1293
00:57:16.58 --> 00:57:18.62
for that first factory.

1294
00:57:18.62 --> 00:57:20.42
I had seen it and-

1295
00:57:20.42 --> 00:57:21.30
You mean driven by it?

1296
00:57:21.30 --> 00:57:22.14
Yeah, just looked at it.

1297
00:57:22.14 --> 00:57:22.98
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1298
00:57:22.98 --> 00:57:26.66
And actually I think we tried to get in,

1299
00:57:26.66 --> 00:57:28.54
but we weren't able to.

1300
00:57:28.54 --> 00:57:30.66
Like the guy there was just not interested

1301
00:57:30.66 --> 00:57:32.18
in talking to us or anything.

1302
00:57:32.18 --> 00:57:33.58
So it was kind of a blip, right?

1303
00:57:33.58 --> 00:57:37.38
It was like, oh, what's that?

1304
00:57:37.38 --> 00:57:40.26
And it kind of a blip, tried to get in, could get in, whatever.

1305
00:57:40.26 --> 00:57:44.98
So it came back up and I had remembered,

1306
00:57:44.98 --> 00:57:46.10
oh, there's this thing.

1307
00:57:46.10 --> 00:57:49.14
So drove back by it, called Jason,

1308
00:57:49.14 --> 00:57:51.30
do you know who owns this?

1309
00:57:51.30 --> 00:57:52.70
Do you have the contact information?

1310
00:57:52.70 --> 00:57:53.78
Is there any way we can talk?

1311
00:57:53.78 --> 00:57:57.14
And Jason's like, yeah, I know who it is.

1312
00:57:57.14 --> 00:57:58.90
Basically like, good luck.

1313
00:57:58.90 --> 00:57:59.74
You know what I mean?

1314
00:57:59.74 --> 00:58:01.26
With this whole thing.

1315
00:58:01.26 --> 00:58:05.30
And I said, well, we're making jeans in Maine.

1316
00:58:05.30 --> 00:58:08.18
We're making jeans in North Carolina.

1317
00:58:08.18 --> 00:58:13.02
Things are working, but at the pace we're selling, right?

1318
00:58:13.02 --> 00:58:14.74
At the pace of product that we're selling,

1319
00:58:14.74 --> 00:58:17.18
because we're a company that literally,

1320
00:58:17.18 --> 00:58:19.86
we take an order in and we manufacture the thing.

1321
00:58:19.86 --> 00:58:22.78
So we're selling a thousand pairs a week right now

1322
00:58:22.78 --> 00:58:24.90
on top of the 10,000 in back order.

1323
00:58:24.90 --> 00:58:27.62
So we're now pushed out from Black Friday,

1324
00:58:27.62 --> 00:58:30.78
we're pushed out for five months,

1325
00:58:30.78 --> 00:58:33.02
which is completely unacceptable.

1326
00:58:33.02 --> 00:58:34.74
It's completely unacceptable in this world

1327
00:58:34.74 --> 00:58:38.22
of getting shit from Amazon dropped in by a drone, right?

1328
00:58:38.22 --> 00:58:39.70
Like an hour after you order it.

1329
00:58:39.70 --> 00:58:44.70
So it just was like, I kind of looked at the numbers

1330
00:58:45.54 --> 00:58:48.86
and the run rate of what we're selling and I'm like,

1331
00:58:48.86 --> 00:58:49.70
it just doesn't work.

1332
00:58:49.70 --> 00:58:50.54
This ain't happening.

1333
00:58:50.54 --> 00:58:51.38
This just doesn't work.

1334
00:58:51.38 --> 00:58:52.90
Can you remember that phone call?

1335
00:58:52.90 --> 00:58:56.10
Like we're not gonna be able to ever produce

1336
00:58:56.10 --> 00:58:57.82
what we need to produce at this run rate

1337
00:58:57.82 --> 00:58:59.78
with this kind of growth trajectory.

1338
00:58:59.78 --> 00:59:04.78
So Jason connected me with the son of the owner.

1339
00:59:06.86 --> 00:59:10.18
The son of the owner connected me with the owner.

1340
00:59:10.18 --> 00:59:12.22
Again, not for sale.

1341
00:59:14.46 --> 00:59:16.58
He entertained me.

1342
00:59:16.58 --> 00:59:21.58
He entertained me in this old 1970s boardroom

1343
00:59:21.62 --> 00:59:25.34
that had a distinct smell to it.

1344
00:59:25.34 --> 00:59:26.90
Him and his wife, Dolores.

1345
00:59:30.38 --> 00:59:33.10
And I could tell this dude was hard.

1346
00:59:33.10 --> 00:59:36.34
You know, like just the way he carried himself,

1347
00:59:36.34 --> 00:59:39.98
the way he looked at me, the way he interacted.

1348
00:59:39.98 --> 00:59:44.02
He even told me, if I was your age, I would kick your ass.

1349
00:59:44.02 --> 00:59:47.46
He said, I would kick your ass and I'd kick your ass

1350
00:59:47.46 --> 00:59:48.42
in business.

1351
00:59:48.42 --> 00:59:50.10
You couldn't touch me.

1352
00:59:50.10 --> 00:59:51.54
You can't compete with me.

1353
00:59:51.54 --> 00:59:53.38
You don't know what I know.

1354
00:59:53.38 --> 00:59:56.34
What I've done out in this plant, I went out in the plant.

1355
00:59:56.34 --> 00:59:57.98
He actually did bring me out in the plant

1356
00:59:57.98 --> 01:00:00.22
for a couple of minutes and I asked the son

1357
01:00:00.22 --> 01:00:02.58
if I could shoot photos and he's like, yeah, go ahead.

1358
01:00:02.58 --> 01:00:03.98
And then he saw me shooting photos

1359
01:00:03.98 --> 01:00:06.18
and he said to Jason, Gatti goes,

1360
01:00:06.18 --> 01:00:08.74
if I see that dude shoot another photo,

1361
01:00:08.74 --> 01:00:10.62
I'm gonna knee cap him right here.

1362
01:00:10.62 --> 01:00:13.86
I mean, that's the type of dude we're dealing with.

1363
01:00:13.86 --> 01:00:18.50
Just to put this in a little bit of perspective.

1364
01:00:18.50 --> 01:00:21.18
So how long had he been in this business for?

1365
01:00:21.18 --> 01:00:22.02
50 years.

1366
01:00:22.02 --> 01:00:26.70
So if you don't know this, if you don't know this,

1367
01:00:26.70 --> 01:00:31.70
this is the old school way.

1368
01:00:31.70 --> 01:00:36.70
And back in the day, well, look at the history, 50 years.

1369
01:00:36.82 --> 01:00:40.90
This is when you had the like union issues.

1370
01:00:40.90 --> 01:00:43.10
This is when you anti-union issues.

1371
01:00:43.10 --> 01:00:45.46
This is when you had a massive influence

1372
01:00:45.46 --> 01:00:48.58
from organized crime in the textile industry.

1373
01:00:48.58 --> 01:00:53.02
Like this is when you had intense, intense competition

1374
01:00:53.02 --> 01:00:54.82
in America, because this is before everything's overseas.

1375
01:00:54.82 --> 01:00:59.98
So now you've got like the most intense competition.

1376
01:00:59.98 --> 01:01:03.30
And this guy, you wanna talk about a survivor and a thriver.

1377
01:01:03.30 --> 01:01:08.30
This is a guy that dominated and dominated for 50 years

1378
01:01:08.30 --> 01:01:13.30
and worked and if you were not a badass,

1379
01:01:13.66 --> 01:01:15.14
you weren't gonna make it.

1380
01:01:15.14 --> 01:01:16.38
It wasn't gonna happen.

1381
01:01:16.38 --> 01:01:17.98
And if you weren't a badass,

1382
01:01:17.98 --> 01:01:19.18
you were gonna get your ass kicked.

1383
01:01:19.18 --> 01:01:20.54
And that's what he did.

1384
01:01:20.54 --> 01:01:21.38
He went around.

1385
01:01:21.38 --> 01:01:23.26
And that's why he was, you know,

1386
01:01:23.26 --> 01:01:26.74
the last standing wash house,

1387
01:01:26.74 --> 01:01:31.74
the last denim plant from the golden age

1388
01:01:31.74 --> 01:01:32.78
of textiles in America.

1389
01:01:32.78 --> 01:01:35.18
This is the guy, the last standing guy.

1390
01:01:35.18 --> 01:01:36.54
It's 100%.

1391
01:01:36.54 --> 01:01:37.38
Right?

1392
01:01:37.38 --> 01:01:38.42
The last one.

1393
01:01:38.42 --> 01:01:40.74
I mean, you're talking about a plant

1394
01:01:40.74 --> 01:01:44.94
that's 170,000 square feet with this wash house,

1395
01:01:44.94 --> 01:01:48.42
now a storage room, right?

1396
01:01:48.42 --> 01:01:52.42
With these big 500 pound washing machines

1397
01:01:52.42 --> 01:01:54.54
that tip forward dump out, you know,

1398
01:01:54.54 --> 01:01:55.66
the wash jeans.

1399
01:01:55.66 --> 01:01:56.50
Like a dump truck, bro.

1400
01:01:56.50 --> 01:01:57.82
Like a dump truck.

1401
01:01:57.82 --> 01:02:00.14
Like a dump truck that haven't been running in years.

1402
01:02:00.14 --> 01:02:01.82
The washing machines don't weigh 500 pounds.

1403
01:02:01.82 --> 01:02:04.58
They wash 500 pounds, you know,

1404
01:02:04.58 --> 01:02:06.66
a quarter ton worth of jeans.

1405
01:02:06.66 --> 01:02:08.30
Yeah, they're nine feet tall.

1406
01:02:08.30 --> 01:02:10.46
They're, I don't know how many thousands of pounds.

1407
01:02:10.46 --> 01:02:13.10
They're massive, massive machines.

1408
01:02:13.10 --> 01:02:15.18
But you know, you walk into this place

1409
01:02:15.18 --> 01:02:17.02
and you could just tell it's like,

1410
01:02:18.70 --> 01:02:21.66
man, like World War II,

1411
01:02:21.66 --> 01:02:24.62
post World War II East Germany, Berlin.

1412
01:02:24.62 --> 01:02:27.86
Like everything's just so closed and dark and dank.

1413
01:02:27.86 --> 01:02:29.70
And it just had this,

1414
01:02:29.70 --> 01:02:32.10
it had a survivor type of feeling.

1415
01:02:32.10 --> 01:02:36.38
Like this thing exists out of sheer survival.

1416
01:02:36.38 --> 01:02:38.02
Like it shouldn't exist.

1417
01:02:38.02 --> 01:02:39.58
It shouldn't be here.

1418
01:02:39.58 --> 01:02:42.30
It should have been gutted and turned into something else

1419
01:02:42.30 --> 01:02:44.22
a long time ago.

1420
01:02:44.22 --> 01:02:47.06
And this guy was not willing to let it go.

1421
01:02:47.06 --> 01:02:48.30
Just force of will.

1422
01:02:48.30 --> 01:02:50.06
Yeah, just a sheer force of will.

1423
01:02:50.06 --> 01:02:55.06
So how did you navigate the conversation

1424
01:02:56.70 --> 01:02:59.34
to go from this isn't for sale.

1425
01:02:59.34 --> 01:03:01.34
And if you put your, don't put your camera away,

1426
01:03:01.34 --> 01:03:03.70
I'm gonna knee cap you right here.

1427
01:03:03.70 --> 01:03:07.62
How do you transition from that to,

1428
01:03:07.62 --> 01:03:09.50
I mean, how do you even get him to open his mind

1429
01:03:09.50 --> 01:03:10.34
a little bit?

1430
01:03:10.34 --> 01:03:14.70
Well, let's just say that it didn't start off great.

1431
01:03:16.22 --> 01:03:18.86
And ultimately it ended up good,

1432
01:03:18.86 --> 01:03:22.86
but the ebbs and flows of our conversations

1433
01:03:22.86 --> 01:03:27.50
in what transpired during this time was,

1434
01:03:27.50 --> 01:03:32.50
not only the strangest negotiation I've ever been part of,

1435
01:03:34.74 --> 01:03:38.38
but even more of one of the more heartfelt too.

1436
01:03:38.38 --> 01:03:39.22
You know what I mean?

1437
01:03:39.22 --> 01:03:41.30
It was a hard negotiation.

1438
01:03:41.30 --> 01:03:43.30
It was hard to talk to him.

1439
01:03:43.30 --> 01:03:45.18
It was hard to find common ground

1440
01:03:46.10 --> 01:03:50.38
because of his passion and our passion for what we're doing.

1441
01:03:50.38 --> 01:03:54.30
I think ultimately he saw something

1442
01:03:54.30 --> 01:03:57.74
that he was willing to believe in, a spark of something.

1443
01:03:57.74 --> 01:04:00.14
And not to get ahead of myself here,

1444
01:04:00.14 --> 01:04:04.18
but the first time he walked in, I had Jason with me

1445
01:04:04.18 --> 01:04:05.82
and while he walks in,

1446
01:04:05.82 --> 01:04:09.82
and he's got his kind of the brows over his eyes

1447
01:04:09.82 --> 01:04:12.66
and he kind of walks in and his wife's behind him

1448
01:04:12.66 --> 01:04:14.78
and Jason's like, what up old timer?

1449
01:04:14.78 --> 01:04:17.94
And while he looked at Jason

1450
01:04:17.94 --> 01:04:20.62
and you could tell they probably had competed in the past

1451
01:04:20.62 --> 01:04:25.62
or whatever, you got two strong Southern men.

1452
01:04:27.42 --> 01:04:30.26
And while he said something smart to Jason,

1453
01:04:30.26 --> 01:04:32.30
like I'll kick your ass or something like that,

1454
01:04:32.30 --> 01:04:35.42
I was just like, I literally put my head in my hand going,

1455
01:04:35.42 --> 01:04:38.78
oh man, how is this gonna go?

1456
01:04:40.18 --> 01:04:45.18
What I boiled down to was, he's in bad health

1457
01:04:46.02 --> 01:04:49.54
and right now, while he's actually not doing good.

1458
01:04:49.54 --> 01:04:51.90
I actually wanted to interview him

1459
01:04:51.90 --> 01:04:53.62
for the documentary we've been working on

1460
01:04:53.62 --> 01:04:56.50
and I've asked three times, I've talked to him,

1461
01:04:56.50 --> 01:04:58.14
I've talked to his wife and at this point,

1462
01:04:58.14 --> 01:05:00.62
I'm probably annoying about it, but he won't do it.

1463
01:05:00.62 --> 01:05:05.10
And he said to me because I remember things a certain way

1464
01:05:05.10 --> 01:05:09.26
and somebody else remembers them another way.

1465
01:05:09.26 --> 01:05:11.58
And I can respect that,

1466
01:05:11.58 --> 01:05:14.74
but some of the stories he told me, which I can't share,

1467
01:05:14.74 --> 01:05:15.58
I can share some of them,

1468
01:05:15.58 --> 01:05:20.10
but are unbelievable, straight out of a movie,

1469
01:05:20.10 --> 01:05:22.46
with organized crime and all that stuff.

1470
01:05:23.30 --> 01:05:26.90
But ultimately, we spent 20 hours over the course

1471
01:05:26.90 --> 01:05:31.90
of a few weeks in that boardroom talking and negotiating.

1472
01:05:32.06 --> 01:05:34.86
He started the negotiation with,

1473
01:05:34.86 --> 01:05:39.86
you are not seeing my books, you are not seeing my financials.

1474
01:05:40.06 --> 01:05:42.70
If you wanna get this thing done,

1475
01:05:42.70 --> 01:05:44.02
he's like, you're gonna, number one,

1476
01:05:44.02 --> 01:05:45.54
you don't have to tell me why,

1477
01:05:45.54 --> 01:05:48.70
because I got somebody ready to stroke me a check right now.

1478
01:05:48.70 --> 01:05:51.38
And that's the person I'm gonna sell it to.

1479
01:05:51.38 --> 01:05:53.14
That's how the negotiation started.

1480
01:05:54.14 --> 01:05:58.50
There were times where this wasn't happening.

1481
01:05:58.50 --> 01:05:59.34
Oh, yeah.

1482
01:05:59.34 --> 01:06:02.10
And let me first start off by saying this.

1483
01:06:02.10 --> 01:06:04.06
When you first called me about what it was,

1484
01:06:04.06 --> 01:06:05.90
what the opportunity was, I was like,

1485
01:06:05.90 --> 01:06:08.02
oh, this is next level.

1486
01:06:08.02 --> 01:06:10.74
You're talking about an incredible staff of people

1487
01:06:10.74 --> 01:06:12.74
that have an incredible skill set,

1488
01:06:12.74 --> 01:06:16.06
an incredible amount of machinery,

1489
01:06:16.06 --> 01:06:19.86
a space that's 170,000 square feet,

1490
01:06:19.86 --> 01:06:22.70
a space that's grandfathered,

1491
01:06:22.70 --> 01:06:24.18
as far as like a wash house,

1492
01:06:24.18 --> 01:06:25.82
you can't build a wash house like that,

1493
01:06:25.82 --> 01:06:27.30
you can't do it anymore.

1494
01:06:27.30 --> 01:06:30.86
There are things that are once in a lifetime.

1495
01:06:30.86 --> 01:06:32.78
This was a once in a lifetime opportunity.

1496
01:06:32.78 --> 01:06:36.22
So I was, and of course, you're telling me,

1497
01:06:36.22 --> 01:06:39.50
hey man, the genes thing that we're doing right now,

1498
01:06:39.50 --> 01:06:42.74
we are not gonna be able to do this.

1499
01:06:42.74 --> 01:06:45.98
And then all of a sudden, here comes like a ray of light.

1500
01:06:45.98 --> 01:06:47.82
Like a lifeboat.

1501
01:06:47.82 --> 01:06:48.98
Like divine intervention.

1502
01:06:48.98 --> 01:06:52.14
Yeah, you're in the ocean, you're alive,

1503
01:06:52.14 --> 01:06:54.82
but you're in the ocean.

1504
01:06:54.82 --> 01:06:56.70
And all of a sudden, lifeboat comes.

1505
01:06:56.70 --> 01:06:58.22
And this thing was like a lifeboat.

1506
01:06:58.22 --> 01:07:02.90
And so I'm super stoked and you can always make deals happen.

1507
01:07:02.90 --> 01:07:04.18
You can always make deals happen.

1508
01:07:04.18 --> 01:07:05.46
You can always figure out a way.

1509
01:07:05.46 --> 01:07:08.02
And my attitude is always,

1510
01:07:08.02 --> 01:07:09.26
well, we'll figure out a way to make a deal.

1511
01:07:09.26 --> 01:07:10.10
We'll make a deal.

1512
01:07:10.98 --> 01:07:12.54
And there was some times in this,

1513
01:07:12.54 --> 01:07:14.14
where we weren't making a deal,

1514
01:07:14.14 --> 01:07:16.58
where it wasn't happening,

1515
01:07:16.58 --> 01:07:18.46
where I just thought, yeah, man,

1516
01:07:18.46 --> 01:07:19.94
what are we gonna do now?

1517
01:07:19.94 --> 01:07:23.82
I was in plan BCD because you'd say,

1518
01:07:23.82 --> 01:07:27.82
hey, let me debrief you on what just happened today.

1519
01:07:27.82 --> 01:07:29.46
You know, and I'd be like, okay,

1520
01:07:30.78 --> 01:07:32.54
the deal fell apart.

1521
01:07:32.54 --> 01:07:33.62
Completely.

1522
01:07:33.62 --> 01:07:34.46
Multiple times.

1523
01:07:34.46 --> 01:07:36.42
And then it would come back together.

1524
01:07:36.42 --> 01:07:37.42
And then it would fall apart.

1525
01:07:37.42 --> 01:07:40.42
But it wasn't like, it didn't seem like

1526
01:07:40.42 --> 01:07:43.34
those deals falling apart were any negotiation.

1527
01:07:43.34 --> 01:07:44.66
It seemed like it just died.

1528
01:07:44.66 --> 01:07:46.66
Like it wasn't like, oh, you know,

1529
01:07:46.66 --> 01:07:49.46
he's hardballing us or he's gonna hold a little bit

1530
01:07:49.46 --> 01:07:51.30
or we gotta come back with a different number.

1531
01:07:51.30 --> 01:07:52.66
It was like, no, you know what?

1532
01:07:52.66 --> 01:07:55.58
I'm actually just not selling this to you anymore.

1533
01:07:55.58 --> 01:08:00.10
Yeah, he didn't even, he honestly didn't care about

1534
01:08:00.10 --> 01:08:02.30
what we were gonna pay for.

1535
01:08:02.30 --> 01:08:05.38
It didn't really have anything to do with money.

1536
01:08:05.38 --> 01:08:08.10
He wanted someone tough.

1537
01:08:10.02 --> 01:08:12.42
That wasn't me, by the way.

1538
01:08:12.42 --> 01:08:17.42
He wanted someone tough who could come in there

1539
01:08:18.62 --> 01:08:23.62
and demand respect that knew how to interact with people

1540
01:08:26.46 --> 01:08:31.10
that understood the business that could carry on his legacy.

1541
01:08:31.10 --> 01:08:33.62
And after 20 hours of negotiation, that wasn't me.

1542
01:08:33.62 --> 01:08:35.10
And I'll share with you in a second

1543
01:08:35.10 --> 01:08:36.06
who it was.

1544
01:08:38.58 --> 01:08:41.38
At that table, that conference table,

1545
01:08:41.38 --> 01:08:44.74
and flying back and forth and having these meetings,

1546
01:08:44.74 --> 01:08:48.38
I did learn something very important about negotiation.

1547
01:08:49.34 --> 01:08:54.18
In negotiation with someone who is so passionate

1548
01:08:54.18 --> 01:08:56.62
about something that they've been building

1549
01:08:56.62 --> 01:08:59.82
for 40, 50 years, 50 years,

1550
01:08:59.82 --> 01:09:03.74
remember this guy had seven plants around North Carolina.

1551
01:09:03.74 --> 01:09:08.74
He made it through the exportation of our jobs

1552
01:09:09.58 --> 01:09:12.30
and machinery in the abandoned communities.

1553
01:09:12.30 --> 01:09:13.78
He survived it.

1554
01:09:14.94 --> 01:09:16.66
You know, and the other thing is,

1555
01:09:22.98 --> 01:09:27.98
this guy, I don't know, he's the last of his kind.

1556
01:09:29.50 --> 01:09:31.50
I think is what it boils down to.

1557
01:09:31.50 --> 01:09:34.78
And he doesn't really believe that anyone can do what he does.

1558
01:09:34.78 --> 01:09:36.34
You ever met somebody like that?

1559
01:09:36.34 --> 01:09:40.46
There is nobody alive that can do what I do.

1560
01:09:40.46 --> 01:09:42.78
He made the jeans for Levi's.

1561
01:09:42.78 --> 01:09:44.82
He made the jeans for Wrangler.

1562
01:09:44.82 --> 01:09:47.34
He made the jeans for Calvin Klein.

1563
01:09:47.34 --> 01:09:49.62
On one case he shared with me,

1564
01:09:49.62 --> 01:09:52.30
he got a contract for Calvin Klein

1565
01:09:52.30 --> 01:09:55.90
and a guy showed up in his office unannounced.

1566
01:09:56.94 --> 01:09:58.74
His secretary comes to see him.

1567
01:09:58.74 --> 01:10:01.50
Hey, there's somebody here to see you.

1568
01:10:01.50 --> 01:10:03.30
And he's like, okay.

1569
01:10:03.30 --> 01:10:06.18
And the guy comes in his office

1570
01:10:06.18 --> 01:10:09.22
and he puts two plane tickets on his desk,

1571
01:10:09.22 --> 01:10:12.82
tells him where, I know where you live.

1572
01:10:12.82 --> 01:10:16.18
I know everything about you.

1573
01:10:16.18 --> 01:10:17.94
Basically, you're coming with me.

1574
01:10:18.90 --> 01:10:20.46
And on the other end of those tickets

1575
01:10:20.46 --> 01:10:22.06
was a guy named Whitey Bulger.

1576
01:10:23.86 --> 01:10:26.18
Wally's like, hold on a second.

1577
01:10:26.18 --> 01:10:30.46
Tells the guy to chill out for a second.

1578
01:10:30.46 --> 01:10:33.30
Gets on the phone, calls a friend of his

1579
01:10:33.30 --> 01:10:35.34
up in New York City saying,

1580
01:10:35.34 --> 01:10:38.86
hey, I got a guy here named Whitey Bulger.

1581
01:10:38.86 --> 01:10:42.46
He's like, he's asking me to pay money.

1582
01:10:42.46 --> 01:10:45.22
He's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Wally, hold on.

1583
01:10:45.22 --> 01:10:47.14
Who? He's like Whitey Bulger.

1584
01:10:47.14 --> 01:10:50.22
He goes, who are you making jeans for?

1585
01:10:50.22 --> 01:10:52.66
He says, Calvin Klein.

1586
01:10:52.66 --> 01:10:55.86
He goes, I'll call you back in 15 minutes.

1587
01:10:55.86 --> 01:10:57.02
Come to find out.

1588
01:10:57.02 --> 01:10:59.30
His friend had the connections.

1589
01:10:59.30 --> 01:11:02.18
I don't even know if I should be sharing this shit, bro.

1590
01:11:02.18 --> 01:11:06.14
His friend had the connections to get to the top.

1591
01:11:06.14 --> 01:11:09.98
And Whitey, basically he gets a phone call back.

1592
01:11:09.98 --> 01:11:11.86
They're like, is Mr. Bulger there?

1593
01:11:11.86 --> 01:11:13.70
Puts him on the phone with Mr. Bulger.

1594
01:11:13.70 --> 01:11:18.02
And Whitey's, he said, I just heard the guy go, yep, yep.

1595
01:11:18.02 --> 01:11:18.94
Yep, got it.

1596
01:11:18.94 --> 01:11:20.82
Okay, puts the phone down and leaves.

1597
01:11:22.82 --> 01:11:25.66
He wasn't paying for every pair of jeans

1598
01:11:25.66 --> 01:11:26.68
that he was making.

1599
01:11:27.94 --> 01:11:29.02
He wasn't giving the cut.

1600
01:11:29.02 --> 01:11:30.38
Wasn't giving the cut.

1601
01:11:30.38 --> 01:11:32.86
He didn't know he was supposed to be giving the cut.

1602
01:11:32.86 --> 01:11:35.18
It had never filtered down to him.

1603
01:11:35.18 --> 01:11:38.62
So he started receiving checks with the cut taken out

1604
01:11:38.62 --> 01:11:40.38
for the product.

1605
01:11:40.38 --> 01:11:42.10
There was a lot of stories like this.

1606
01:11:42.10 --> 01:11:44.22
There was some pretty, there was some stories

1607
01:11:44.22 --> 01:11:45.34
that he was telling me.

1608
01:11:45.34 --> 01:11:47.62
And I think the point is, is he wanted me

1609
01:11:47.62 --> 01:11:49.14
to know how tough he was.

1610
01:11:49.98 --> 01:11:53.54
Now, here's a guy who's at end of life.

1611
01:11:53.54 --> 01:11:55.94
You know, it's actually kind of, it's kind of sad too.

1612
01:11:55.94 --> 01:11:57.02
He's at end of life.

1613
01:11:57.02 --> 01:11:58.34
He's built this empire.

1614
01:11:58.34 --> 01:12:00.62
He's invested everything in this.

1615
01:12:01.46 --> 01:12:04.22
He's the best in the world at it.

1616
01:12:04.22 --> 01:12:07.54
He's in the best in the world at making denim blue jeans.

1617
01:12:11.70 --> 01:12:14.78
And he's staring at death.

1618
01:12:17.70 --> 01:12:21.12
We spent a week negotiating, two weeks negotiating,

1619
01:12:21.12 --> 01:12:23.10
and then it's just radio silence.

1620
01:12:23.10 --> 01:12:25.62
There's no more conversation.

1621
01:12:26.46 --> 01:12:28.58
I'm trying to figure out what's going on.

1622
01:12:28.58 --> 01:12:30.26
I think the deal's done, man.

1623
01:12:30.26 --> 01:12:31.30
I think it's dead.

1624
01:12:31.30 --> 01:12:32.86
There's no more conversation.

1625
01:12:32.86 --> 01:12:34.94
There was another entity.

1626
01:12:34.94 --> 01:12:36.26
Another entity that wanted a purchase of it.

1627
01:12:36.26 --> 01:12:38.70
That wonderbuy that had a ton of money,

1628
01:12:38.70 --> 01:12:42.58
backed by massive, massive hundreds of millions of dollars

1629
01:12:42.58 --> 01:12:44.66
and they were ready to roll in there.

1630
01:12:44.66 --> 01:12:47.22
I finally get on the phone with his wife, Dolores,

1631
01:12:47.22 --> 01:12:48.42
got her cell phone number.

1632
01:12:48.42 --> 01:12:50.78
She sounds pretty wound up.

1633
01:12:50.78 --> 01:12:53.10
You know, hey, Wally, he's in the hospital.

1634
01:12:55.50 --> 01:12:57.14
Why don't you come down next week?

1635
01:12:58.90 --> 01:13:00.30
So I go back down.

1636
01:13:00.30 --> 01:13:01.58
I'm sitting in the boardroom.

1637
01:13:01.58 --> 01:13:03.38
Wally comes in and he sits down.

1638
01:13:04.38 --> 01:13:09.18
You know, and he's looking rough and he's welling up.

1639
01:13:09.18 --> 01:13:10.02
You know what I mean?

1640
01:13:10.02 --> 01:13:12.90
He's just, he's welling up in his eyes and I'm like,

1641
01:13:12.90 --> 01:13:14.10
what's going on?

1642
01:13:14.10 --> 01:13:15.98
He basically said, nobody knows this.

1643
01:13:15.98 --> 01:13:18.54
I haven't even shared it with my son.

1644
01:13:18.54 --> 01:13:23.54
But he had a heart attack and he died.

1645
01:13:26.54 --> 01:13:28.66
Called, I guess his wife called.

1646
01:13:28.66 --> 01:13:32.02
They brought him back to life, got him back

1647
01:13:32.02 --> 01:13:32.98
and they actually said,

1648
01:13:32.98 --> 01:13:36.98
there is no way you should be alive right now.

1649
01:13:36.98 --> 01:13:39.06
You must have more to do.

1650
01:13:39.06 --> 01:13:41.02
And that was the defining moment

1651
01:13:41.02 --> 01:13:43.18
where he opened up back for negotiation

1652
01:13:43.18 --> 01:13:47.14
where he just, he was staring death in the face

1653
01:13:47.14 --> 01:13:51.34
and then he dies, he gets brought back to life

1654
01:13:51.34 --> 01:13:53.74
and now I'm sitting in a board with him

1655
01:13:53.74 --> 01:13:57.10
and I have my wife next to me, Amanda.

1656
01:13:57.10 --> 01:14:02.10
And I knew bringing her down was gonna be important

1657
01:14:02.30 --> 01:14:06.42
because him and his wife have been doing this thing

1658
01:14:06.42 --> 01:14:07.78
and they've been a unit.

1659
01:14:07.78 --> 01:14:11.38
You know, they've just, they're like-minded

1660
01:14:11.38 --> 01:14:13.22
in one place off the other one

1661
01:14:13.22 --> 01:14:16.12
and similar to the way Amanda is and I am.

1662
01:14:16.12 --> 01:14:21.12
And it was then that he decided that we had what it took,

1663
01:14:23.76 --> 01:14:25.24
that I didn't have what it took,

1664
01:14:25.24 --> 01:14:27.76
but that she had what it took.

1665
01:14:27.76 --> 01:14:30.08
Cause he was asking, he asked me,

1666
01:14:30.08 --> 01:14:32.70
actually asked me to bring her down.

1667
01:14:32.70 --> 01:14:34.40
I said, Amanda, I wanna bring you down North Carolina.

1668
01:14:34.40 --> 01:14:36.56
Listen, Wally's asking to meet you.

1669
01:14:36.56 --> 01:14:37.60
She's like, why do I need to go?

1670
01:14:37.60 --> 01:14:38.64
She's like, this is your thing.

1671
01:14:38.64 --> 01:14:39.90
This is what you do.

1672
01:14:39.90 --> 01:14:41.000
I said, I don't know.

1673
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.16
I said, he wants to meet you.

1674
01:14:43.16 --> 01:14:45.88
And I called him back.

1675
01:14:45.88 --> 01:14:46.72
Yeah, I'm gonna be coming down.

1676
01:14:46.72 --> 01:14:48.44
He's like, you're gonna bring Amanda, right?

1677
01:14:48.44 --> 01:14:51.16
And I'm like, yes, I'm gonna bring Amanda.

1678
01:14:52.36 --> 01:14:56.60
He stared at me across the table and he said to me,

1679
01:14:56.60 --> 01:14:58.96
he goes, he's like, you can't do this.

1680
01:14:58.96 --> 01:15:01.84
He goes, I don't trust you can do it.

1681
01:15:01.84 --> 01:15:04.04
He goes, but she can.

1682
01:15:04.04 --> 01:15:05.76
I watched the way she moves.

1683
01:15:05.76 --> 01:15:07.16
I watched the way she walks.

1684
01:15:07.16 --> 01:15:08.68
I watched the way she interacts.

1685
01:15:08.68 --> 01:15:11.000
I said, she can make this happen.

1686
01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.88
And I wouldn't do a deal with you,

1687
01:15:12.88 --> 01:15:14.28
but I'll do a deal with her.

1688
01:15:14.28 --> 01:15:19.28
And I said, you're right.

1689
01:15:19.76 --> 01:15:20.80
Yeah.

1690
01:15:20.80 --> 01:15:21.64
You're right, man.

1691
01:15:21.64 --> 01:15:23.56
I know, man, I agree with Wally, bro.

1692
01:15:23.56 --> 01:15:25.12
100%.

1693
01:15:25.12 --> 01:15:26.96
It's like, you're right.

1694
01:15:26.96 --> 01:15:29.28
And you know, that was the turning point, man.

1695
01:15:29.28 --> 01:15:31.40
The guy died, got brought back to life.

1696
01:15:31.40 --> 01:15:33.36
He saw his legacy in front of him.

1697
01:15:33.36 --> 01:15:37.32
He saw, you know, a family.

1698
01:15:37.32 --> 01:15:39.72
And I'm talking about a family.

1699
01:15:39.72 --> 01:15:42.88
He's, of course, the Jocko thing came into play

1700
01:15:42.88 --> 01:15:45.84
because he had a special forces guy that lives next door

1701
01:15:45.84 --> 01:15:48.24
to him who told him all about you.

1702
01:15:48.24 --> 01:15:50.76
So you've got people who are hungry to bring back

1703
01:15:50.76 --> 01:15:52.52
manufacturing in America.

1704
01:15:52.52 --> 01:15:55.56
And it was at that point that he believed

1705
01:15:55.56 --> 01:15:58.92
that we could carry on his legacy and things move forward.

1706
01:16:00.24 --> 01:16:04.72
And bro, like even with even his belief

1707
01:16:04.72 --> 01:16:06.72
that it could move forward, that we could handle it

1708
01:16:06.72 --> 01:16:09.84
was still, it was still just the beginning

1709
01:16:09.84 --> 01:16:13.12
of all the bullshit that we had to go through

1710
01:16:13.12 --> 01:16:15.56
to make the deal happen.

1711
01:16:15.56 --> 01:16:19.68
Well, one thing I remember, another point was,

1712
01:16:19.68 --> 01:16:22.52
there was, you call me up and you're like,

1713
01:16:22.52 --> 01:16:23.96
it ain't happening.

1714
01:16:23.96 --> 01:16:26.32
Or you send me a text like, it ain't happening.

1715
01:16:26.32 --> 01:16:28.92
And I'm like, oh, you know, well,

1716
01:16:28.92 --> 01:16:32.64
so we get on the phone and you're like,

1717
01:16:32.64 --> 01:16:37.56
hey, we're going through the due diligence and whatnot.

1718
01:16:37.56 --> 01:16:40.48
And there's no phase two environmental study.

1719
01:16:40.48 --> 01:16:43.88
Hasn't been done in 30 years or whatever, 40 years.

1720
01:16:43.88 --> 01:16:48.16
And you're like, hey, man, if this comes up bad,

1721
01:16:49.08 --> 01:16:52.80
we could be out a million, two million dollars

1722
01:16:52.80 --> 01:16:55.96
worth of like cleanup and repair and payments.

1723
01:16:56.84 --> 01:16:59.48
And you're like, we just don't know.

1724
01:16:59.48 --> 01:17:02.80
And I remember I'm like, okay.

1725
01:17:02.80 --> 01:17:04.60
I said, hey, man, how much would it cost us

1726
01:17:04.60 --> 01:17:06.12
to build that factory?

1727
01:17:06.12 --> 01:17:09.72
And you're like, I don't know.

1728
01:17:09.72 --> 01:17:11.000
You're like, oh, you're running the numbers.

1729
01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.08
You're like 25, 20, 25, maybe 30 million.

1730
01:17:15.08 --> 01:17:18.52
And I go, let's do this deal.

1731
01:17:18.52 --> 01:17:20.44
You're like, Roger that, you know?

1732
01:17:20.44 --> 01:17:22.44
And that's again, that's one of those things

1733
01:17:22.44 --> 01:17:25.08
where you were really close to the deal, of course.

1734
01:17:25.08 --> 01:17:28.44
But I looked at, that's actually a small risk

1735
01:17:28.44 --> 01:17:31.16
when you put it up against what we would have to have done.

1736
01:17:31.16 --> 01:17:35.60
And look, even if we had a billion dollars,

1737
01:17:35.60 --> 01:17:38.40
to say, okay, now go build that factory.

1738
01:17:38.40 --> 01:17:39.56
How long does that take?

1739
01:17:39.56 --> 01:17:41.08
Now go get those people.

1740
01:17:41.08 --> 01:17:42.08
Where do you get them from?

1741
01:17:42.08 --> 01:17:43.92
Now train those people.

1742
01:17:43.92 --> 01:17:46.96
It's maybe seven years.

1743
01:17:46.96 --> 01:17:48.40
Like literally seven years.

1744
01:17:48.40 --> 01:17:49.48
If we had a billion dollars,

1745
01:17:49.48 --> 01:17:50.84
it would have taken seven years.

1746
01:17:50.84 --> 01:17:53.76
So those little risks, those additional risks

1747
01:17:53.76 --> 01:17:56.40
that you take, because it's a once in a lifetime.

1748
01:17:57.40 --> 01:17:59.72
This is a once in a lifetime deal.

1749
01:17:59.72 --> 01:18:01.08
Yeah, it is.

1750
01:18:01.08 --> 01:18:06.08
It shouldn't have existed and it shouldn't have happened.

1751
01:18:09.60 --> 01:18:12.40
One person's sheer force of will

1752
01:18:12.40 --> 01:18:17.40
to hang on to the golden age of manufacturing.

1753
01:18:18.12 --> 01:18:23.12
One person's decision is actually gonna spearhead

1754
01:18:23.44 --> 01:18:26.64
this Renaissance, this revolution of manufacturing.

1755
01:18:26.64 --> 01:18:29.68
We're actually just dovetailing onto that thing

1756
01:18:29.68 --> 01:18:31.000
to carry it forward.

1757
01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:35.44
He was like the underground resistance for 40 years.

1758
01:18:35.44 --> 01:18:39.36
Just like sitting in a cave, keeping those machines on,

1759
01:18:39.36 --> 01:18:40.84
just keeping it going.

1760
01:18:40.84 --> 01:18:43.60
And everybody I come in contact with.

1761
01:18:43.60 --> 01:18:46.92
Everybody I came in contact with since then has said,

1762
01:18:46.92 --> 01:18:51.92
oh, you're the owner of the new of Wally's factory.

1763
01:18:52.32 --> 01:18:54.44
I said, yeah, and they're like,

1764
01:18:54.44 --> 01:18:57.32
can't believe you got that done with Wally.

1765
01:18:57.32 --> 01:18:59.000
Like, I mean, everybody knows the guy

1766
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.40
and he's a hard ass, man.

1767
01:19:01.40 --> 01:19:06.40
Dude's a hard ass, but ultimately it got done.

1768
01:19:06.48 --> 01:19:08.48
We got it done.

1769
01:19:08.48 --> 01:19:09.60
Freaking sign the papers.

1770
01:19:09.60 --> 01:19:11.48
Yeah, we got it done when they're like,

1771
01:19:11.48 --> 01:19:14.16
one of his stipends right at the end of this whole thing

1772
01:19:14.16 --> 01:19:15.96
was like a cliffhanger, right?

1773
01:19:15.96 --> 01:19:18.64
Hey, okay, I want the money in a week.

1774
01:19:18.64 --> 01:19:19.80
That's, yeah.

1775
01:19:19.80 --> 01:19:22.60
The guy's crazy, man.

1776
01:19:22.60 --> 01:19:23.84
He's crazy.

1777
01:19:23.84 --> 01:19:25.000
I want the money in a week.

1778
01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.48
Do we escrow him some funds?

1779
01:19:27.48 --> 01:19:31.48
Oh, I mean, I remember wiring big fat numbers around

1780
01:19:31.48 --> 01:19:32.80
and going, yeah.

1781
01:19:32.80 --> 01:19:33.72
And here's the other thing,

1782
01:19:33.72 --> 01:19:35.000
like you kind of breeze through this,

1783
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:38.72
but you can't see my books and you can't see my financials.

1784
01:19:38.72 --> 01:19:43.16
No, he actually had a piece of like just notebook paper.

1785
01:19:43.16 --> 01:19:46.12
And he wrote on his revenue what he did.

1786
01:19:46.12 --> 01:19:49.000
He's like, this is how much I pay for heat.

1787
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.08
This is how much, this is my payroll.

1788
01:19:53.08 --> 01:19:55.72
Here's lights electric.

1789
01:19:55.72 --> 01:19:58.72
He goes, and here's the revenue.

1790
01:19:58.72 --> 01:20:01.32
And you can see this is how this is the math works.

1791
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.20
And that's cool.

1792
01:20:04.20 --> 01:20:05.84
You're like, hey, Roger, that you should,

1793
01:20:05.84 --> 01:20:08.24
you sent me a text of a napkin or whatever.

1794
01:20:08.24 --> 01:20:10.48
Like, hey, John, this is what we're buying.

1795
01:20:10.48 --> 01:20:11.88
Recording to the napkin.

1796
01:20:11.88 --> 01:20:15.24
I think most people walking in there would be like,

1797
01:20:15.24 --> 01:20:18.04
this is like, this guy's crazy.

1798
01:20:18.04 --> 01:20:19.84
Like this is a shithole.

1799
01:20:19.84 --> 01:20:20.68
Yeah.

1800
01:20:20.68 --> 01:20:24.12
And I think it's the future.

1801
01:20:24.12 --> 01:20:29.08
Yeah. And I think, thankfully, you had the understanding

1802
01:20:29.08 --> 01:20:31.08
of the true value.

1803
01:20:31.08 --> 01:20:33.92
And I think just like every good deal,

1804
01:20:33.92 --> 01:20:38.68
like he got what he wanted.

1805
01:20:38.68 --> 01:20:39.48
He really did.

1806
01:20:39.48 --> 01:20:43.96
He got a team that's going to come on board,

1807
01:20:43.96 --> 01:20:45.36
that's going to continue that fight,

1808
01:20:45.36 --> 01:20:47.88
that's going to expand that fight.

1809
01:20:47.88 --> 01:20:50.24
And that's what he wanted.

1810
01:20:50.24 --> 01:20:54.04
And then all parties can walk away feeling good

1811
01:20:54.04 --> 01:20:54.60
about the deal.

1812
01:20:54.60 --> 01:20:57.12
That's a great deal when that happens.

1813
01:20:59.84 --> 01:21:04.68
And then it's like you finally get to go into the factory

1814
01:21:04.68 --> 01:21:06.04
for the first time.

1815
01:21:06.04 --> 01:21:08.64
And this is like buying a car.

1816
01:21:08.64 --> 01:21:11.40
This is like walking up, seeing a car in the parking lot.

1817
01:21:11.40 --> 01:21:13.000
And the guy's like, hey, I'll sell you that car.

1818
01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.92
Over on the other side of the parking lot.

1819
01:21:14.92 --> 01:21:16.84
Can tell what it's a Corolla.

1820
01:21:16.84 --> 01:21:19.08
It's a Toyota Corolla.

1821
01:21:19.08 --> 01:21:20.12
And you're like, how many miles?

1822
01:21:20.12 --> 01:21:21.80
He's like, don't worry about it.

1823
01:21:21.80 --> 01:21:22.96
Can I kick the tires?

1824
01:21:22.96 --> 01:21:24.48
Nope.

1825
01:21:24.48 --> 01:21:25.32
Is there an engine in it?

1826
01:21:25.32 --> 01:21:26.16
Is there an engine in it?

1827
01:21:26.16 --> 01:21:27.28
I'm telling you there is.

1828
01:21:27.28 --> 01:21:28.76
I drove it here.

1829
01:21:28.76 --> 01:21:30.000
How long time ago?

1830
01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:31.84
So you just need to buy this thing.

1831
01:21:31.84 --> 01:21:34.80
So you finally get to look under the hood of this thing.

1832
01:21:34.80 --> 01:21:35.60
What would you see?

1833
01:21:35.60 --> 01:21:38.52
What did we actually buy when you got in there?

1834
01:21:38.52 --> 01:21:44.72
You know, I think that, I mean, where

1835
01:21:44.72 --> 01:21:46.04
to go with that question.

1836
01:21:46.04 --> 01:21:49.48
I could go so many different directions.

1837
01:21:49.48 --> 01:21:52.40
I think we bought exactly what we needed.

1838
01:21:52.40 --> 01:21:57.12
And the challenge was that I didn't anticipate

1839
01:21:57.12 --> 01:22:01.64
was a double merger of companies and cultures.

1840
01:22:01.64 --> 01:22:05.40
A double merger of companies and cultures.

1841
01:22:05.40 --> 01:22:10.56
I did not anticipate the difficulty of that.

1842
01:22:10.56 --> 01:22:11.44
Yeah, we went in there.

1843
01:22:11.44 --> 01:22:16.16
We stripped out 17 roll off dumpsters full of stuff.

1844
01:22:16.16 --> 01:22:18.24
We gutted the lights and put all LEDs.

1845
01:22:18.24 --> 01:22:22.36
We put $75,000 of freon into the system.

1846
01:22:22.36 --> 01:22:23.84
So we had cooling in there.

1847
01:22:23.84 --> 01:22:25.72
So it wasn't a sweatshop.

1848
01:22:25.72 --> 01:22:28.000
Like we went through and with machinery.

1849
01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.08
We bought new machinery.

1850
01:22:29.08 --> 01:22:30.04
We stripped stuff apart.

1851
01:22:30.04 --> 01:22:31.08
We built a fulfillment center.

1852
01:22:31.08 --> 01:22:32.12
We stripped out the warehouse.

1853
01:22:32.12 --> 01:22:34.28
We got new controllers, custom controllers.

1854
01:22:34.28 --> 01:22:35.16
We bought new dryers.

1855
01:22:35.16 --> 01:22:36.40
Like we, I mean, we did everything we

1856
01:22:36.40 --> 01:22:37.80
need to do for an infrastructure.

1857
01:22:37.80 --> 01:22:41.04
But a double merger of companies and culture

1858
01:22:41.04 --> 01:22:42.40
was the tricky part.

1859
01:22:42.40 --> 01:22:48.08
That the first pictures you're sending me.

1860
01:22:48.08 --> 01:22:52.40
You're like half laughing and half crying.

1861
01:22:52.40 --> 01:22:56.04
You're like, back there, there's a wash house.

1862
01:22:56.04 --> 01:22:57.28
It's in there.

1863
01:22:57.28 --> 01:23:00.20
There's just piles of equipment.

1864
01:23:00.20 --> 01:23:02.80
And it looked like areas of the factory obviously

1865
01:23:02.80 --> 01:23:05.12
hadn't been cleaned or used in decades.

1866
01:23:05.12 --> 01:23:05.88
In decades.

1867
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:13.24
I remember you excited because you found the floor.

1868
01:23:13.24 --> 01:23:16.000
In some of the areas, you actually got enough stuff

1869
01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.12
out of there so that you found the floor.

1870
01:23:19.12 --> 01:23:21.76
People were smoking inside the building, Chaco.

1871
01:23:21.76 --> 01:23:23.56
Cigarettes.

1872
01:23:23.56 --> 01:23:25.36
I walked through and I'm like, I'm walking.

1873
01:23:25.36 --> 01:23:25.80
I'm walking.

1874
01:23:25.80 --> 01:23:30.28
I'm like, I'm like, huh, there must be some smoke coming in.

1875
01:23:30.28 --> 01:23:33.56
And I walked by and there's a person smoking a cigarette.

1876
01:23:33.56 --> 01:23:36.44
I'm talking, this is straight out of the 70s, bro.

1877
01:23:36.44 --> 01:23:41.08
Like shit hasn't changed since 1970.

1878
01:23:41.08 --> 01:23:43.60
Same type of a culture.

1879
01:23:43.60 --> 01:23:47.28
Same type of a setup hasn't changed.

1880
01:23:47.28 --> 01:23:48.16
It looked rough.

1881
01:23:48.16 --> 01:23:50.56
Now you're going to tell everybody to change.

1882
01:23:50.56 --> 01:23:53.44
The cool thing was, before we get to the merge

1883
01:23:53.44 --> 01:23:57.60
and the cultures, that, and I've been talking about this

1884
01:23:57.60 --> 01:23:58.88
a decent amount lately.

1885
01:23:58.88 --> 01:24:01.28
So we even say it, I'm fine.

1886
01:24:01.28 --> 01:24:03.72
OK, it's not what you hang on the wall.

1887
01:24:03.72 --> 01:24:05.48
You can't just run around with a bunch of sayings.

1888
01:24:05.48 --> 01:24:07.56
But actually, it kind of does help.

1889
01:24:07.56 --> 01:24:10.48
And I talked about the fact that David Hackworth changed

1890
01:24:10.48 --> 01:24:13.96
fighter company, or sorry, Fox company in Korea to fighter

1891
01:24:13.96 --> 01:24:14.56
company.

1892
01:24:14.56 --> 01:24:17.56
And he changed the hopeless in Vietnam.

1893
01:24:17.56 --> 01:24:20.16
The 439th, he changed the hopeless to the hardcore.

1894
01:24:20.16 --> 01:24:22.40
He just changed these names, changed these things.

1895
01:24:22.40 --> 01:24:26.68
Hey, gave them little patches to wear on their uniforms, right?

1896
01:24:26.68 --> 01:24:29.88
Made their salute into hardcore Rekondos.

1897
01:24:29.88 --> 01:24:30.72
No fucking slack.

1898
01:24:30.72 --> 01:24:32.24
Like he made these changes.

1899
01:24:32.24 --> 01:24:33.76
Like just made them.

1900
01:24:33.76 --> 01:24:35.64
And that starts to shift things.

1901
01:24:35.64 --> 01:24:40.16
And out of the gate, you're just like cleaning.

1902
01:24:40.16 --> 01:24:42.84
Just cleaning this place up, right?

1903
01:24:42.84 --> 01:24:44.44
Getting rid of a lot of this junk.

1904
01:24:44.44 --> 01:24:46.24
Getting rid of a lot of these old machines

1905
01:24:46.24 --> 01:24:48.000
that didn't have any purpose anymore.

1906
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.84
Painting things.

1907
01:24:50.84 --> 01:24:53.48
A wage increase across the board for everybody.

1908
01:24:53.48 --> 01:24:54.68
Like out of the gate, no?

1909
01:24:54.68 --> 01:24:59.000
Making $7.50 an hour to make a minimum North Carolina wage.

1910
01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.48
$7.50 an hour.

1911
01:25:00.48 --> 01:25:03.44
Who can live off a $7.50 an hour?

1912
01:25:03.44 --> 01:25:06.48
So the wage increase, the cooling system

1913
01:25:06.48 --> 01:25:08.64
you're talking about, I mean, you know?

1914
01:25:08.64 --> 01:25:10.92
Like you got to post that cooling system again.

1915
01:25:10.92 --> 01:25:12.16
That thing's a monster.

1916
01:25:12.16 --> 01:25:13.48
It's like I don't understand.

1917
01:25:13.48 --> 01:25:15.24
Like you have a swamp cooler.

1918
01:25:15.24 --> 01:25:17.92
There's like a small pool of water in there.

1919
01:25:17.92 --> 01:25:18.88
You needed to cool off.

1920
01:25:18.88 --> 01:25:19.60
You could dive in it.

1921
01:25:19.60 --> 01:25:20.92
It's like crazy, right?

1922
01:25:20.92 --> 01:25:23.76
But and what was the little bet you had with Kip?

1923
01:25:23.76 --> 01:25:25.92
Like I'll give you $1,000 if you can get this thing running

1924
01:25:25.92 --> 01:25:26.20
or something.

1925
01:25:26.20 --> 01:25:27.24
What was the deal on that?

1926
01:25:27.24 --> 01:25:29.12
Kip came down and he's, you got to remember,

1927
01:25:29.12 --> 01:25:30.76
Kip spent in a lot of factories.

1928
01:25:30.76 --> 01:25:33.16
And I hope he doesn't mind me sharing this.

1929
01:25:33.16 --> 01:25:36.40
But he told me once, like he went into a factory.

1930
01:25:36.40 --> 01:25:38.32
They drove, you know, an hour.

1931
01:25:38.32 --> 01:25:42.28
Then they drove, you know, 15 miles down this dirt road.

1932
01:25:42.28 --> 01:25:44.76
And then they then they at the corner of the dirt road,

1933
01:25:44.76 --> 01:25:45.84
there was somebody carrying.

1934
01:25:45.84 --> 01:25:48.64
He thought it was like bananas or something out of the forest.

1935
01:25:48.64 --> 01:25:52.72
Then they drove down an elephant trail, another five miles

1936
01:25:52.72 --> 01:25:56.68
into the middle of a jungle where people were like carrying

1937
01:25:56.68 --> 01:26:00.24
out whatever he didn't know.

1938
01:26:00.24 --> 01:26:01.80
And there's this building.

1939
01:26:01.80 --> 01:26:05.76
There's this three story big brick building

1940
01:26:05.76 --> 01:26:08.32
with bars on the windows.

1941
01:26:08.32 --> 01:26:11.60
And he's like, don't tell me this is a factory.

1942
01:26:11.60 --> 01:26:14.44
And he goes in and there's a bunch of girls,

1943
01:26:14.44 --> 01:26:18.16
young, young girls in there sewing.

1944
01:26:18.16 --> 01:26:21.76
And he's like, get me the hell out of here.

1945
01:26:21.76 --> 01:26:24.88
And what those folks were carrying out in bare feet

1946
01:26:24.88 --> 01:26:26.88
was the garments.

1947
01:26:26.88 --> 01:26:30.36
And of course, you know, he's like, I think,

1948
01:26:30.36 --> 01:26:33.92
I think for like Kip, like he knows what factories,

1949
01:26:33.92 --> 01:26:35.60
good factories look like.

1950
01:26:35.60 --> 01:26:37.48
He knows what infrastructure looks like.

1951
01:26:37.48 --> 01:26:39.52
He knows what's right and he knows what's wrong.

1952
01:26:39.52 --> 01:26:41.76
He's seen it all.

1953
01:26:41.76 --> 01:26:44.84
He walked into that back room with Jason Gaddy.

1954
01:26:44.84 --> 01:26:47.16
And Jason, you know how Jason is, he's like, you know,

1955
01:26:47.16 --> 01:26:49.36
kind of get that sales personality.

1956
01:26:49.36 --> 01:26:50.52
Oh my God, look at this.

1957
01:26:50.52 --> 01:26:51.36
It got that.

1958
01:26:51.36 --> 01:26:52.20
So cool.

1959
01:26:52.20 --> 01:26:53.04
We got this.

1960
01:26:53.04 --> 01:26:53.88
We got that.

1961
01:26:53.88 --> 01:26:54.72
He's like, this thing, it shoots out.

1962
01:26:54.72 --> 01:26:55.56
It'll cool this whole place down.

1963
01:26:55.56 --> 01:26:57.48
And Kip's like, this thing ain't working, Jason.

1964
01:26:57.48 --> 01:26:58.88
He's like, no, it's working.

1965
01:26:58.88 --> 01:26:59.72
It's good to go.

1966
01:26:59.72 --> 01:27:01.12
You just got to keep good walks.

1967
01:27:01.12 --> 01:27:03.56
And he's like, yeah, there's no way.

1968
01:27:03.56 --> 01:27:05.12
Yeah, there's no way this works.

1969
01:27:05.12 --> 01:27:06.48
He's like, no, it works.

1970
01:27:06.48 --> 01:27:07.60
And Kip's like, I don't know.

1971
01:27:07.60 --> 01:27:12.20
I'll bet you $1,000 that this thing doesn't work.

1972
01:27:12.20 --> 01:27:13.48
Come to find out.

1973
01:27:13.48 --> 01:27:15.88
That shit didn't work.

1974
01:27:15.88 --> 01:27:17.44
That shit didn't work.

1975
01:27:17.44 --> 01:27:21.48
I think Kip found out like two weeks ago that we had

1976
01:27:21.48 --> 01:27:22.96
to dump that type of cash into it.

1977
01:27:22.96 --> 01:27:27.08
But stuff like that, definitely important.

1978
01:27:27.08 --> 01:27:30.36
Well, all that was happening for me, it was more of,

1979
01:27:30.36 --> 01:27:33.16
how am I going to connect with the people

1980
01:27:33.16 --> 01:27:37.04
that have learned leadership from Wally?

1981
01:27:38.24 --> 01:27:41.72
Again, this dude is living in the 70s, 80s,

1982
01:27:41.72 --> 01:27:46.72
where you protected your own at whatever cost.

1983
01:27:47.80 --> 01:27:52.80
How am I going to untangle and reeducate

1984
01:27:53.60 --> 01:27:57.96
what our culture is like, how we lead, how we treat people?

1985
01:27:57.96 --> 01:28:00.88
And I remember the first thing I did was I went up

1986
01:28:00.88 --> 01:28:04.12
to the three managers and they're all looking at me

1987
01:28:04.12 --> 01:28:06.000
like, who is this guy?

1988
01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:06.84
You know what I mean?

1989
01:28:06.84 --> 01:28:10.72
And I just, I said to them, I said, listen, I said,

1990
01:28:12.52 --> 01:28:14.32
they're like, are you going to fire us?

1991
01:28:14.32 --> 01:28:15.64
I said, no, I'm not going to fire you.

1992
01:28:15.64 --> 01:28:17.16
Are you going to fire us and bring your own people in?

1993
01:28:17.16 --> 01:28:18.08
No.

1994
01:28:18.08 --> 01:28:20.12
Well, how do we know that?

1995
01:28:20.12 --> 01:28:25.12
I said, we didn't buy this place because of the machinery

1996
01:28:25.60 --> 01:28:26.44
or the building.

1997
01:28:26.44 --> 01:28:28.40
I said, we bought it because of the people.

1998
01:28:28.40 --> 01:28:32.76
I said, that woman over there, that's felling jeans.

1999
01:28:32.76 --> 01:28:35.04
I have never seen anything like it.

2000
01:28:35.04 --> 01:28:36.16
That one over there.

2001
01:28:36.16 --> 01:28:37.92
I said, I've never seen anything like it.

2002
01:28:37.92 --> 01:28:41.52
I said, the skill here you don't find in America anymore.

2003
01:28:41.52 --> 01:28:45.56
I said, we're here because of you and nothing else.

2004
01:28:45.56 --> 01:28:46.72
That's it.

2005
01:28:46.72 --> 01:28:51.08
And the one, there's this one woman and she's staring at me,

2006
01:28:51.08 --> 01:28:53.24
staring through me.

2007
01:28:53.24 --> 01:28:56.28
I was actually a little bit feared for my life.

2008
01:28:56.28 --> 01:28:58.96
And I get done and she does this little smirk

2009
01:28:58.96 --> 01:29:02.20
and she smiles, she goes, I like you.

2010
01:29:02.20 --> 01:29:03.40
And she just walks off.

2011
01:29:03.40 --> 01:29:05.68
And it was like a lot of those,

2012
01:29:05.68 --> 01:29:09.56
keeping those conversations warm and touch points.

2013
01:29:09.56 --> 01:29:12.12
It was just the beginning.

2014
01:29:12.12 --> 01:29:15.88
We're in process right now, obviously,

2015
01:29:15.88 --> 01:29:18.64
of trying to continue changing the culture.

2016
01:29:18.64 --> 01:29:20.32
It's difficult, man.

2017
01:29:20.32 --> 01:29:22.68
I mean, obviously you've come down twice already.

2018
01:29:22.68 --> 01:29:24.08
What did you think when you first walked in

2019
01:29:24.08 --> 01:29:25.44
for the first time?

2020
01:29:25.44 --> 01:29:28.16
I was freaking totally stoked.

2021
01:29:28.16 --> 01:29:32.80
But you can tell, again, this is something

2022
01:29:32.80 --> 01:29:34.92
that I get to see a lot at Eshalon Front.

2023
01:29:34.92 --> 01:29:36.64
And I get to see it in the military too.

2024
01:29:36.64 --> 01:29:41.64
You could tell that the people had some level of,

2025
01:29:43.12 --> 01:29:45.44
for lack of a better word, I've said this phrase

2026
01:29:45.44 --> 01:29:50.000
the other day, post-traumatic leadership disorder.

2027
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:50.84
Right?

2028
01:29:50.84 --> 01:29:54.32
Yeah, so you have Wally, who's a survivor,

2029
01:29:54.32 --> 01:29:59.32
who's going to crush, destroy, kick ass to make this work.

2030
01:30:01.04 --> 01:30:02.92
And what does that translate to

2031
01:30:02.92 --> 01:30:04.48
on the front lines, tyrannical leadership?

2032
01:30:04.48 --> 01:30:06.64
Like you're gonna shut up and do it the way I'm telling you.

2033
01:30:06.64 --> 01:30:08.04
That's it, that's the way it is.

2034
01:30:08.04 --> 01:30:10.64
And you could tell that that's the environment

2035
01:30:10.64 --> 01:30:12.60
that these folks, now by the time I got down there,

2036
01:30:12.60 --> 01:30:16.48
again, the lights were in, the place was clean.

2037
01:30:16.48 --> 01:30:21.48
So you started to see, I could smell the hope, right?

2038
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.80
I could start to smell, but then we'll get into

2039
01:30:23.80 --> 01:30:26.24
some of the conversations that we had as we went forward.

2040
01:30:26.24 --> 01:30:28.72
And as Eshalon Front showed up there,

2041
01:30:28.72 --> 01:30:32.60
you could start to see, okay, but when I got in there,

2042
01:30:32.60 --> 01:30:36.80
I actually saw hope and I saw people looking at me

2043
01:30:36.80 --> 01:30:39.64
and as I started talking to people,

2044
01:30:39.64 --> 01:30:40.84
you see that there's hope there

2045
01:30:40.84 --> 01:30:42.56
and they were ready for that transition.

2046
01:30:42.56 --> 01:30:46.56
What's, so we'll get to that.

2047
01:30:46.56 --> 01:30:50.28
In the meantime, the other monster is out there.

2048
01:30:50.28 --> 01:30:51.68
I think people really gotta understand.

2049
01:30:51.68 --> 01:30:54.80
There's two monsters, we're walking through the factory

2050
01:30:54.80 --> 01:30:56.12
getting phone calls about this other thing.

2051
01:30:56.12 --> 01:30:56.96
100%.

2052
01:30:56.96 --> 01:30:57.80
And we're doing this other thing,

2053
01:30:57.80 --> 01:30:59.48
we're getting phone calls about these deals.

2054
01:30:59.48 --> 01:31:02.68
It's just, it's a lot, it's a lot.

2055
01:31:02.68 --> 01:31:03.84
The other monster now.

2056
01:31:03.84 --> 01:31:04.68
It's a freaking lot, right?

2057
01:31:04.68 --> 01:31:06.76
The other monster's hungry.

2058
01:31:06.76 --> 01:31:10.84
We, one of the main things that we wanted to get done

2059
01:31:10.84 --> 01:31:13.68
was make a ready to drink moque

2060
01:31:13.68 --> 01:31:17.12
that people could go into a store and say,

2061
01:31:17.12 --> 01:31:19.48
hey, I need protein right now.

2062
01:31:19.48 --> 01:31:21.24
I need to fill myself up.

2063
01:31:21.24 --> 01:31:22.84
I need some nutrition.

2064
01:31:22.84 --> 01:31:24.56
I want it to be healthy.

2065
01:31:24.56 --> 01:31:27.20
We need ready to drink moque.

2066
01:31:27.20 --> 01:31:31.64
We've had great success and supreme demand

2067
01:31:31.64 --> 01:31:32.64
for the powdered moque.

2068
01:31:32.64 --> 01:31:34.48
I mean, it's the best stuff going.

2069
01:31:34.48 --> 01:31:36.52
So, but people, sometimes you don't have time to,

2070
01:31:36.52 --> 01:31:37.88
you don't have a shape, cup, all those things.

2071
01:31:37.88 --> 01:31:40.52
So we need to make a ready to drink moque.

2072
01:31:40.52 --> 01:31:45.52
And that was a cha, cha, cha challenge.

2073
01:31:46.20 --> 01:31:47.04
Yeah, that's true.

2074
01:31:47.04 --> 01:31:48.76
A challenge to make the right formula.

2075
01:31:48.76 --> 01:31:51.40
A challenge to make the formula as healthy

2076
01:31:51.40 --> 01:31:55.92
as it can possibly be, as efficacious as it can possibly be.

2077
01:31:55.92 --> 01:31:58.20
And you gotta counter that with making it taste as good

2078
01:31:58.20 --> 01:31:59.48
as you can possibly make it.

2079
01:31:59.48 --> 01:32:02.12
So people wanna drink it so it tastes good.

2080
01:32:02.12 --> 01:32:06.24
And so we have all those just to formulate the thing.

2081
01:32:06.24 --> 01:32:08.92
And once you formulate it, guess what you gotta do?

2082
01:32:08.92 --> 01:32:11.12
You gotta actually make it.

2083
01:32:11.12 --> 01:32:12.36
So how's this going down?

2084
01:32:12.36 --> 01:32:15.56
Yeah, I mean, it's funny and listening to you talk it.

2085
01:32:15.56 --> 01:32:19.80
It's all about this whole thing that we're doing,

2086
01:32:19.80 --> 01:32:21.52
not trying to do, we're doing it,

2087
01:32:21.52 --> 01:32:23.24
we're executing something.

2088
01:32:23.24 --> 01:32:26.28
It's all around people and community.

2089
01:32:27.20 --> 01:32:30.04
Like it takes people, it takes knowledge,

2090
01:32:30.04 --> 01:32:32.68
it takes equipment, it takes community.

2091
01:32:32.68 --> 01:32:34.76
Like it's the same damn thing.

2092
01:32:34.76 --> 01:32:37.08
We're trying to make stuff, you know?

2093
01:32:37.08 --> 01:32:39.88
We're trying to not lose who we are.

2094
01:32:39.88 --> 01:32:43.36
Cause if we do, I mean, I don't even wanna guess

2095
01:32:43.36 --> 01:32:45.76
what happens for our kid's generation.

2096
01:32:45.76 --> 01:32:48.28
And honestly, I was saying to somebody the other day,

2097
01:32:48.28 --> 01:32:50.48
it's on us right now.

2098
01:32:50.48 --> 01:32:52.52
It's on the Gen Xers.

2099
01:32:52.52 --> 01:32:55.32
I mean, us three at this table, it's on us.

2100
01:32:55.32 --> 01:32:58.44
We're the next leaders of this nation.

2101
01:32:58.44 --> 01:33:02.16
We're the business men and women of this nation.

2102
01:33:02.16 --> 01:33:04.76
We're gonna drive the direction.

2103
01:33:04.76 --> 01:33:06.64
We're gonna drive a divide,

2104
01:33:06.64 --> 01:33:09.04
or we're gonna try to unify.

2105
01:33:09.04 --> 01:33:14.000
You know, and I was explaining these market dynamics,

2106
01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.44
actually to Kip and the team that,

2107
01:33:19.40 --> 01:33:21.04
like what are we trying to do?

2108
01:33:22.08 --> 01:33:24.12
And I'll try not to get off on a tangent here,

2109
01:33:24.12 --> 01:33:27.34
but you have the greatest generation.

2110
01:33:27.34 --> 01:33:31.12
The greatest generation were responsible

2111
01:33:31.12 --> 01:33:34.72
for turning on the war machine of World War II,

2112
01:33:34.72 --> 01:33:37.72
America's war machine, which was America's factories.

2113
01:33:37.72 --> 01:33:40.64
We had the capabilities, we had the knowledge,

2114
01:33:40.64 --> 01:33:43.12
we knew how to build tooling if we didn't have it.

2115
01:33:43.12 --> 01:33:47.000
We knew how to make machines from scratch, from ore,

2116
01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.24
from iron ore.

2117
01:33:48.24 --> 01:33:52.80
We would freaking heat and cast and mold

2118
01:33:52.80 --> 01:33:54.64
and pound that shit into shape

2119
01:33:54.64 --> 01:33:58.92
until it turned into a tank or a truck, whatever we needed.

2120
01:33:58.92 --> 01:34:01.32
And we truly have lost that.

2121
01:34:01.32 --> 01:34:04.20
And it's been crushing the middle class, you know?

2122
01:34:04.20 --> 01:34:08.64
And this is all about trying to give the middle class

2123
01:34:08.64 --> 01:34:13.32
what makes America great, which is real opportunity.

2124
01:34:13.32 --> 01:34:15.56
Because without it, who are we?

2125
01:34:17.80 --> 01:34:21.52
I guess it's just a 250 year seizure, you know?

2126
01:34:21.52 --> 01:34:24.16
And we're trying to do something about it.

2127
01:34:24.16 --> 01:34:27.92
So I guess my point is is,

2128
01:34:29.80 --> 01:34:33.28
we've kept this singleness of purpose across the board

2129
01:34:33.28 --> 01:34:35.72
on origin and on jockel fuel.

2130
01:34:35.72 --> 01:34:39.40
And although one serves the things you wear and need

2131
01:34:39.40 --> 01:34:42.60
and use in life, the other one actually serves, you know,

2132
01:34:42.60 --> 01:34:44.84
the things you need for nutrition

2133
01:34:44.84 --> 01:34:47.64
and you need to consume this stuff.

2134
01:34:47.64 --> 01:34:49.44
I was in Europe a couple weeks ago,

2135
01:34:49.44 --> 01:34:52.56
there's foods that are illegal that are made here.

2136
01:34:52.56 --> 01:34:54.44
You can't buy shit in Europe.

2137
01:34:55.44 --> 01:34:59.28
Like stuff that comes in boxes that has its

2138
01:34:59.28 --> 01:35:01.20
at the end of it and cheese at the beginning.

2139
01:35:01.20 --> 01:35:03.44
You know, like that type of stuff

2140
01:35:03.44 --> 01:35:05.40
that you want to consume by the handfuls.

2141
01:35:05.40 --> 01:35:07.64
But you know, like we're like the things

2142
01:35:07.64 --> 01:35:11.68
that these big conglomerates are able to make, you know?

2143
01:35:11.68 --> 01:35:13.36
Like they're just not good for you.

2144
01:35:13.36 --> 01:35:16.28
And we're trying to make something that's good for you.

2145
01:35:18.08 --> 01:35:23.08
So this market dynamic of this World War II generation

2146
01:35:24.32 --> 01:35:27.88
that is all but gone, that passed the stories

2147
01:35:27.88 --> 01:35:31.72
on to us Gen Xers, these were the future leaders.

2148
01:35:31.72 --> 01:35:34.28
Our kids have never, I don't want to say

2149
01:35:34.28 --> 01:35:36.12
have never had any authentic experiences,

2150
01:35:36.12 --> 01:35:39.92
but most of their experiences come through a device.

2151
01:35:39.92 --> 01:35:44.84
Likes, follows, friends through this device.

2152
01:35:44.84 --> 01:35:46.20
They didn't hear the stories

2153
01:35:46.20 --> 01:35:48.72
from the greatest generation directly.

2154
01:35:48.72 --> 01:35:51.08
So they lie with us.

2155
01:35:51.96 --> 01:35:54.36
They've never really experienced anything authentic.

2156
01:35:54.36 --> 01:35:57.000
They've never walked into a factory.

2157
01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.60
And so you have this void of,

2158
01:36:01.44 --> 01:36:03.60
I don't want to use the word authenticity,

2159
01:36:03.60 --> 01:36:06.60
but you have this void of reality

2160
01:36:06.60 --> 01:36:09.48
because everything is behind a screen.

2161
01:36:09.48 --> 01:36:12.08
You can't see it truly.

2162
01:36:12.08 --> 01:36:14.64
You can't smell it really.

2163
01:36:14.64 --> 01:36:16.80
You can't feel it.

2164
01:36:16.80 --> 01:36:19.76
And ultimately you don't know who made it.

2165
01:36:19.76 --> 01:36:23.32
And there's something missing.

2166
01:36:23.32 --> 01:36:27.08
The thing that's missing is what they fought for, right?

2167
01:36:27.08 --> 01:36:28.96
It's what the greatest generation fought for.

2168
01:36:28.96 --> 01:36:30.20
It's what they went to war for

2169
01:36:30.20 --> 01:36:32.08
to protect the things we had.

2170
01:36:32.08 --> 01:36:34.68
And then we sell those things to the lowest bidder.

2171
01:36:36.04 --> 01:36:36.88
That's what we did.

2172
01:36:36.88 --> 01:36:40.96
We sold it to the lowest bidder, but we let it happen.

2173
01:36:40.96 --> 01:36:45.96
And origin and jockel fuel,

2174
01:36:45.96 --> 01:36:47.08
like the things we're doing,

2175
01:36:47.08 --> 01:36:49.92
it sits in the middle of this triangle

2176
01:36:49.92 --> 01:36:54.44
where our kids are gonna experience something authentic

2177
01:36:54.44 --> 01:36:55.44
for the first time.

2178
01:36:55.44 --> 01:36:57.56
They're gonna walk into a factory and go,

2179
01:36:57.56 --> 01:37:02.12
whoa, whoa, what is this?

2180
01:37:02.12 --> 01:37:05.60
And they're gonna pick up a boot and smell the leather.

2181
01:37:07.04 --> 01:37:09.08
So we're gonna leverage this technology

2182
01:37:09.08 --> 01:37:11.28
they're used to to tell a different story,

2183
01:37:11.28 --> 01:37:13.92
to write a different script, to change the narrative.

2184
01:37:13.92 --> 01:37:15.24
And that's the idea here.

2185
01:37:15.24 --> 01:37:20.24
And use and not romanticize about the greatest generation,

2186
01:37:22.80 --> 01:37:26.16
but honor them through what we're doing.

2187
01:37:26.16 --> 01:37:28.52
And that's the ultimate goal.

2188
01:37:28.52 --> 01:37:30.000
Like when you look at this immersion camp,

2189
01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.04
we're here in this immersion camp right now.

2190
01:37:32.04 --> 01:37:34.16
You got 350 people here

2191
01:37:34.16 --> 01:37:36.56
and we're walking through the factory yesterday.

2192
01:37:36.56 --> 01:37:39.52
And for the first time, 70% of the people here

2193
01:37:39.52 --> 01:37:40.48
have never been here.

2194
01:37:40.48 --> 01:37:42.56
They've never been to the factory.

2195
01:37:42.56 --> 01:37:44.56
The looks on their faces and the questions

2196
01:37:44.56 --> 01:37:47.56
they're asking, I mean, we spent four hours

2197
01:37:47.56 --> 01:37:49.16
walking through the factories.

2198
01:37:49.16 --> 01:37:51.84
And they're just like, wow.

2199
01:37:51.84 --> 01:37:53.88
And I know you've had a ton of people come up to you

2200
01:37:53.88 --> 01:37:55.36
and I've had a ton of people come up to me,

2201
01:37:55.36 --> 01:37:59.84
but we're not selling them anything.

2202
01:37:59.84 --> 01:38:01.84
We're showing them a way to do something.

2203
01:38:03.04 --> 01:38:06.80
They manifest what their belief in what we're doing

2204
01:38:06.80 --> 01:38:08.56
and their alignment with what we're doing.

2205
01:38:08.56 --> 01:38:11.44
They manifest that by purchasing a hoodie or a pair of jeans

2206
01:38:11.44 --> 01:38:13.16
or a boots or grabbing a mocha or a goat.

2207
01:38:13.16 --> 01:38:18.16
But they're living into the same thing we're leaning into.

2208
01:38:18.44 --> 01:38:23.44
And I think that that's what makes it so not powerful.

2209
01:38:24.40 --> 01:38:26.68
It's what makes it so important.

2210
01:38:27.56 --> 01:38:32.12
It's why Wally sold us that factory.

2211
01:38:32.12 --> 01:38:33.52
That's what he saw.

2212
01:38:33.52 --> 01:38:37.48
He saw a generation that actually could do what he did

2213
01:38:37.48 --> 01:38:40.000
because he didn't believe it was gonna happen.

2214
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:43.12
He thought we were too soft, soft and weak.

2215
01:38:43.12 --> 01:38:48.12
So there's a mindset.

2216
01:38:48.12 --> 01:38:53.12
There's an air, there's a frequency

2217
01:38:54.48 --> 01:38:58.80
that we're all working on to try to make this shit happen.

2218
01:38:58.80 --> 01:39:03.80
And it all is living as ideas

2219
01:39:03.80 --> 01:39:07.92
in wanting to be executed,

2220
01:39:07.92 --> 01:39:11.92
but sometimes recklessly.

2221
01:39:11.92 --> 01:39:13.56
And we're trying to organize that

2222
01:39:13.56 --> 01:39:18.40
so that it's executed more refined, I guess you could say.

2223
01:39:20.68 --> 01:39:22.36
Whether it's with the jeans,

2224
01:39:22.36 --> 01:39:26.84
whether it's with trying to make Moch RTDs.

2225
01:39:26.84 --> 01:39:29.72
And it sounds silly a little bit for me to say it like that,

2226
01:39:29.72 --> 01:39:32.60
but it's not because that shit is hard to make.

2227
01:39:32.60 --> 01:39:34.92
There's five people in America who can make it

2228
01:39:34.92 --> 01:39:35.84
that we know of.

2229
01:39:35.84 --> 01:39:37.28
We're looking for more.

2230
01:39:37.28 --> 01:39:40.12
Hey, listen, if you can make this Moch RTD for us

2231
01:39:40.12 --> 01:39:42.32
in America, please let us know.

2232
01:39:42.32 --> 01:39:44.60
Cause it's been difficult.

2233
01:39:44.60 --> 01:39:46.96
What we wanted to do to keep it clean,

2234
01:39:46.96 --> 01:39:50.04
you know, the way we needed to package it,

2235
01:39:50.04 --> 01:39:53.08
aha, how we wanted to keep it actually good for you

2236
01:39:53.08 --> 01:39:54.28
and healthy for you.

2237
01:39:54.28 --> 01:39:56.40
There's actually not a lot of people who can do that.

2238
01:39:56.40 --> 01:39:58.44
And the people who can,

2239
01:39:58.44 --> 01:40:03.44
the people who can are held back by the big brands

2240
01:40:03.48 --> 01:40:06.28
who have the market share and the control.

2241
01:40:06.28 --> 01:40:11.28
And we're trying to come in and trying to take some

2242
01:40:12.16 --> 01:40:15.72
of that market share and take some of that line time.

2243
01:40:15.72 --> 01:40:19.92
And those big brands pay them off to not let us in

2244
01:40:19.92 --> 01:40:21.60
or anyone like us in.

2245
01:40:21.60 --> 01:40:23.28
They're not going to let us in.

2246
01:40:23.28 --> 01:40:25.08
They ain't letting us on the line.

2247
01:40:25.08 --> 01:40:28.68
They're not giving up an ounce of market share to us.

2248
01:40:30.32 --> 01:40:32.64
Good thing we're fighters.

2249
01:40:32.64 --> 01:40:33.48
You know what I mean?

2250
01:40:33.48 --> 01:40:36.48
Like a little bit of savages, a little bit arrogant

2251
01:40:36.48 --> 01:40:39.12
at times, but uncompromising.

2252
01:40:39.12 --> 01:40:42.44
So, you know, we're in that process right now.

2253
01:40:42.44 --> 01:40:45.88
I mean, we can't make what we need to make for the supply.

2254
01:40:45.88 --> 01:40:47.76
We can make a certain amount.

2255
01:40:47.76 --> 01:40:50.04
You know, like we have the product, we've had it.

2256
01:40:50.04 --> 01:40:53.32
Our first manufacturer who committed to us then dropped us.

2257
01:40:53.32 --> 01:40:55.64
I'm sure they got a side deal meal,

2258
01:40:55.64 --> 01:40:57.80
some type of check cut to keep us out of the line.

2259
01:40:57.80 --> 01:40:58.64
I'm not sure.

2260
01:40:58.64 --> 01:40:59.92
Just shut, keep the line shut.

2261
01:40:59.92 --> 01:41:00.76
Yeah.

2262
01:41:00.76 --> 01:41:01.60
Just don't make anything.

2263
01:41:01.60 --> 01:41:02.92
They're paying them not.

2264
01:41:02.92 --> 01:41:04.04
They either are going to make them

2265
01:41:04.04 --> 01:41:05.80
or they're not going to make anybody else.

2266
01:41:05.80 --> 01:41:08.12
And these companies are getting paid off to do that.

2267
01:41:08.12 --> 01:41:08.96
Not to make anything.

2268
01:41:08.96 --> 01:41:09.96
Not to make anything.

2269
01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.08
Just to go back to your tangent about making things

2270
01:41:16.08 --> 01:41:18.24
and what it's like to see that.

2271
01:41:18.24 --> 01:41:22.32
I think there's a certain human instinct that we have

2272
01:41:22.32 --> 01:41:24.48
that a certain dopamine reward that we get

2273
01:41:24.48 --> 01:41:25.52
for creating things, right?

2274
01:41:25.52 --> 01:41:26.96
Otherwise, how would we be here?

2275
01:41:26.96 --> 01:41:29.12
How would we as human beings have lasted

2276
01:41:29.12 --> 01:41:31.04
if we didn't get a little dopamine hit

2277
01:41:31.04 --> 01:41:36.04
from building a freaking roof over our head with sticks

2278
01:41:36.56 --> 01:41:39.92
or put rocks into a circle and make a fire?

2279
01:41:39.92 --> 01:41:43.24
If you didn't get some kind of dopamine hit from that,

2280
01:41:43.24 --> 01:41:45.08
we wouldn't exist as human beings.

2281
01:41:45.08 --> 01:41:46.36
So I think we all have that.

2282
01:41:46.36 --> 01:41:49.72
And if anybody's ever, if you've ever created anything,

2283
01:41:49.72 --> 01:41:51.08
if you've ever made anything,

2284
01:41:51.08 --> 01:41:52.40
you get that little dopamine hit.

2285
01:41:52.40 --> 01:41:53.24
Oh yeah.

2286
01:41:53.24 --> 01:41:54.88
If you've, when you were a little kid

2287
01:41:54.88 --> 01:41:58.08
and you made a tree fort, you enjoyed that.

2288
01:41:58.08 --> 01:42:00.80
As you get older, you remodel the kitchen.

2289
01:42:00.80 --> 01:42:03.000
If you did that, you hung drywall.

2290
01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:03.92
At the end of the day, you looked up,

2291
01:42:03.92 --> 01:42:05.16
you got a dopamine hit.

2292
01:42:05.16 --> 01:42:06.88
I remember one time I was building a retaining wall

2293
01:42:06.88 --> 01:42:07.72
in my backyard.

2294
01:42:07.72 --> 01:42:08.56
I was in the Navy.

2295
01:42:08.56 --> 01:42:10.84
I was probably, but I was like, probably,

2296
01:42:11.76 --> 01:42:15.80
I guess I was 16, 17 years in the Navy.

2297
01:42:15.80 --> 01:42:18.64
And I had taken a three day weekend

2298
01:42:18.64 --> 01:42:20.12
so I could build a retaining wall.

2299
01:42:20.12 --> 01:42:23.20
I'm out there laying bricks, laying block.

2300
01:42:23.20 --> 01:42:26.24
And I got done and I just came in and I said,

2301
01:42:26.24 --> 01:42:29.84
hey babe, I think when I retire, I'm gonna become a Mason.

2302
01:42:29.84 --> 01:42:32.76
You know, like no one's bothering me.

2303
01:42:32.76 --> 01:42:34.12
I'm listening to some music.

2304
01:42:34.12 --> 01:42:36.28
The block don't talk.

2305
01:42:36.28 --> 01:42:37.92
It's the block isn't gonna die.

2306
01:42:37.92 --> 01:42:39.60
It's not even gonna get injured.

2307
01:42:40.64 --> 01:42:42.52
And look what I did today.

2308
01:42:42.52 --> 01:42:44.40
You know, like it's a good feeling.

2309
01:42:44.40 --> 01:42:46.56
That dopamine hit is a real thing.

2310
01:42:46.56 --> 01:42:51.56
And unfortunately, the dopamine hit is subsidized

2311
01:42:51.64 --> 01:42:56.20
by clicking, you know, deliver this to my house.

2312
01:42:56.20 --> 01:43:00.36
And it seems like they don't even want you to understand

2313
01:43:00.36 --> 01:43:01.32
where this stuff came from.

2314
01:43:01.32 --> 01:43:02.72
They just want you to get the dopamine hit

2315
01:43:02.72 --> 01:43:05.04
of hitting add to cart.

2316
01:43:05.04 --> 01:43:06.000
Yes. Right?

2317
01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:07.28
They don't want you to know what it feels like

2318
01:43:07.28 --> 01:43:08.68
to make this stuff.

2319
01:43:08.68 --> 01:43:09.60
And you rip that out.

2320
01:43:09.60 --> 01:43:13.80
That's why you see, you know, for years now, for kids,

2321
01:43:13.80 --> 01:43:16.40
it's been, oh, you know what you need to do is,

2322
01:43:16.40 --> 01:43:20.92
you need to go to college and learn, you know,

2323
01:43:20.92 --> 01:43:23.94
you need to learn computer science or liberal arts.

2324
01:43:23.94 --> 01:43:27.30
But you're not gonna go to a technical school.

2325
01:43:27.30 --> 01:43:28.50
We don't want you to go to a technical school.

2326
01:43:28.50 --> 01:43:29.88
We don't want you to be an electrician.

2327
01:43:29.88 --> 01:43:31.22
We don't want you to be a plumber.

2328
01:43:31.22 --> 01:43:32.38
We don't want you to be a mason.

2329
01:43:32.38 --> 01:43:33.94
We don't want you to be a carpenter.

2330
01:43:33.94 --> 01:43:35.86
We don't want you to know how to work a loom.

2331
01:43:35.86 --> 01:43:38.58
We want, but we want you to buy this stuff.

2332
01:43:39.62 --> 01:43:44.70
So there's like a capitalization of dopamine

2333
01:43:44.70 --> 01:43:45.62
and they make it easier.

2334
01:43:45.62 --> 01:43:47.04
And you know, even like, you know,

2335
01:43:47.04 --> 01:43:48.38
you throughout computer science,

2336
01:43:48.38 --> 01:43:51.86
actually people that do good computer science

2337
01:43:51.86 --> 01:43:54.54
and computer engineering, they get dopamine hits

2338
01:43:54.54 --> 01:43:55.74
cause they're building something.

2339
01:43:55.74 --> 01:43:57.06
And it's something that they can make.

2340
01:43:57.06 --> 01:44:00.42
I can tell you get dopamine when you make a video

2341
01:44:00.42 --> 01:44:02.94
and it's good, you even make a part of a video sometime

2342
01:44:02.94 --> 01:44:05.02
and you're like, hey, I built this

2343
01:44:05.02 --> 01:44:06.94
and there's a certain amount of satisfaction.

2344
01:44:06.94 --> 01:44:08.58
And like, that's a certain amount.

2345
01:44:08.58 --> 01:44:09.70
That's something that I don't understand.

2346
01:44:09.70 --> 01:44:12.54
I can't make anything on a computer as you know, right?

2347
01:44:12.54 --> 01:44:13.90
Yes, we don't.

2348
01:44:13.90 --> 01:44:16.18
But I know that you get it from there

2349
01:44:16.18 --> 01:44:18.38
and I get to go straight to the source on that.

2350
01:44:18.38 --> 01:44:23.38
So this is what happens, I think, you know, it's like,

2351
01:44:24.34 --> 01:44:25.50
look, I'm not gonna sit here and say

2352
01:44:25.50 --> 01:44:28.22
it's a conspiracy theory or a conspiracy

2353
01:44:28.22 --> 01:44:30.58
that you know, the big corporations don't want people

2354
01:44:30.58 --> 01:44:32.94
to make things on their own.

2355
01:44:32.94 --> 01:44:34.70
But that's just the way it's turned out.

2356
01:44:34.70 --> 01:44:38.10
The way it's turned out is, is if you wanna make,

2357
01:44:38.10 --> 01:44:40.52
for instance, a ready to drink protein,

2358
01:44:41.70 --> 01:44:44.06
they don't want you to know how good that feels

2359
01:44:44.06 --> 01:44:46.30
to deliver that product and have people

2360
01:44:46.30 --> 01:44:48.26
have a healthy choice when they go out.

2361
01:44:48.26 --> 01:44:50.42
They don't want you to feel that.

2362
01:44:50.42 --> 01:44:52.70
Because if you feel that, other people might feel it.

2363
01:44:52.70 --> 01:44:53.82
And if other people might feel it,

2364
01:44:53.82 --> 01:44:56.58
all of a sudden we got a problem on our hands.

2365
01:44:56.58 --> 01:44:58.22
Dude, 100%.

2366
01:44:58.22 --> 01:45:00.46
It's like freaking Soil and Green.

2367
01:45:00.46 --> 01:45:01.62
The way this shit works.

2368
01:45:01.62 --> 01:45:02.46
Remember that movie?

2369
01:45:02.46 --> 01:45:03.30
Yeah.

2370
01:45:03.30 --> 01:45:05.10
They're lining up to eat the wafers, man.

2371
01:45:05.10 --> 01:45:06.98
Everybody's lining up to eat the wafers

2372
01:45:06.98 --> 01:45:09.90
and we're like the insurgency, right?

2373
01:45:09.90 --> 01:45:12.58
Saying, hey, join us.

2374
01:45:12.58 --> 01:45:14.38
There's a better way.

2375
01:45:14.38 --> 01:45:19.38
Here's the truth, we gotta have truth.

2376
01:45:19.38 --> 01:45:20.46
Yeah.

2377
01:45:20.46 --> 01:45:22.26
Gotta have truth, so.

2378
01:45:22.26 --> 01:45:25.30
So we, so through great effort,

2379
01:45:25.30 --> 01:45:28.82
we eventually, we find a manufacturer in Canada.

2380
01:45:28.82 --> 01:45:30.70
Yeah, seven hours away.

2381
01:45:30.70 --> 01:45:31.78
Our neighbors in Toronto.

2382
01:45:31.78 --> 01:45:34.14
Our neighbors, God bless.

2383
01:45:35.18 --> 01:45:37.54
And they're up there and they're, you know, not,

2384
01:45:37.54 --> 01:45:39.22
they're not willing to sit back

2385
01:45:39.22 --> 01:45:42.02
and shut down their line for money.

2386
01:45:42.02 --> 01:45:42.86
Right.

2387
01:45:42.86 --> 01:45:44.54
We're gonna have things made.

2388
01:45:44.54 --> 01:45:45.38
Good on them.

2389
01:45:45.38 --> 01:45:48.02
So the malt comes, here's another, you know,

2390
01:45:48.02 --> 01:45:52.10
just another, the flavors on the go, right?

2391
01:45:52.10 --> 01:45:53.82
So we got discipline go.

2392
01:45:53.82 --> 01:45:55.46
When did the first one come out?

2393
01:45:55.46 --> 01:45:56.30
A year ago?

2394
01:45:57.26 --> 01:45:58.10
Two years ago?

2395
01:45:58.10 --> 01:45:58.94
Was it two years ago?

2396
01:45:58.94 --> 01:45:59.78
The new, the new adjusted.

2397
01:45:59.78 --> 01:46:02.58
No, when's the very first discipline go?

2398
01:46:02.58 --> 01:46:03.58
Who can remember?

2399
01:46:03.58 --> 01:46:04.70
So a couple years ago.

2400
01:46:04.70 --> 01:46:06.26
We have one flavor, it comes out.

2401
01:46:06.26 --> 01:46:09.54
It's based on my taste buds, which is a bad idea.

2402
01:46:09.54 --> 01:46:11.74
I don't drink sugar.

2403
01:46:11.74 --> 01:46:13.18
I don't eat sugar.

2404
01:46:13.18 --> 01:46:14.30
Or let me rephrase it.

2405
01:46:14.30 --> 01:46:15.14
I don't drink a lot.

2406
01:46:15.14 --> 01:46:18.98
I haven't drank in a Coca-Cola in decades, right?

2407
01:46:18.98 --> 01:46:22.62
So the very first Jocco discipline go that I had,

2408
01:46:22.62 --> 01:46:24.26
which had a little bit of monk fruit in it,

2409
01:46:24.26 --> 01:46:26.42
it to me, it tasted like friggin, you know,

2410
01:46:26.42 --> 01:46:27.82
candy cane almost, right?

2411
01:46:27.82 --> 01:46:29.30
I'm like, oh, hell yeah, this is sweet.

2412
01:46:29.30 --> 01:46:30.78
Hell yeah.

2413
01:46:30.78 --> 01:46:33.46
And that's sort of the baseline that we used

2414
01:46:33.46 --> 01:46:35.22
in the beginning for the drink.

2415
01:46:35.22 --> 01:46:40.22
And the bottom line is it was to use Echo's term

2416
01:46:40.22 --> 01:46:41.18
and Echo's correct.

2417
01:46:41.18 --> 01:46:43.22
He's like, you're not normal, meaning Jocco,

2418
01:46:43.22 --> 01:46:44.50
you're not normal.

2419
01:46:44.50 --> 01:46:47.54
And he's right, my taste buds are not normal.

2420
01:46:47.54 --> 01:46:51.34
And so we ended up, as we developed the flavors

2421
01:46:51.34 --> 01:46:55.78
for the discipline go, look, we made the best possible drink.

2422
01:46:55.78 --> 01:46:58.70
The efforts that we went through to make it,

2423
01:46:58.70 --> 01:47:02.10
how we made it, to make it as clean and make it as natural,

2424
01:47:02.10 --> 01:47:04.74
to hold off on making it for seven or eight months

2425
01:47:04.74 --> 01:47:06.58
so we could actually pasteurize it instead of just,

2426
01:47:06.58 --> 01:47:07.58
hey, you know what, why don't you just throw

2427
01:47:07.58 --> 01:47:09.10
some chemicals in there?

2428
01:47:09.10 --> 01:47:09.94
Just throw them in there.

2429
01:47:09.94 --> 01:47:10.78
It'll be okay.

2430
01:47:10.78 --> 01:47:11.62
No, we're not gonna do that.

2431
01:47:11.62 --> 01:47:13.46
We're gonna pasteurize it.

2432
01:47:13.46 --> 01:47:16.66
What about, hey, monk food's kind of expensive.

2433
01:47:16.66 --> 01:47:20.30
We can throw some of the aspartame, we can do that?

2434
01:47:20.30 --> 01:47:21.54
Hey, no one will really know.

2435
01:47:21.54 --> 01:47:23.58
Yes, we know, I know.

2436
01:47:23.58 --> 01:47:24.42
We're not doing it.

2437
01:47:24.42 --> 01:47:25.38
We're gonna hold the line.

2438
01:47:25.38 --> 01:47:28.14
So we make, well, you should just dump a bunch of caffeine

2439
01:47:28.14 --> 01:47:29.10
that way people will feel it.

2440
01:47:29.10 --> 01:47:30.26
Yeah, then they're gonna crash too

2441
01:47:30.26 --> 01:47:32.18
and it's not good, it's a freaking bad form.

2442
01:47:32.18 --> 01:47:33.18
We're not doing it.

2443
01:47:34.10 --> 01:47:37.98
So we end up making an outstanding drink

2444
01:47:37.98 --> 01:47:39.42
in terms of performance.

2445
01:47:39.42 --> 01:47:42.98
But taste, not the best.

2446
01:47:42.98 --> 01:47:45.22
You definitely need it to get better.

2447
01:47:45.22 --> 01:47:47.26
So we had to attack that issue.

2448
01:47:47.26 --> 01:47:49.06
Man, I got really happy.

2449
01:47:49.06 --> 01:47:51.14
I got really used to the taste, by the way.

2450
01:47:51.14 --> 01:47:51.98
Yeah, so did I.

2451
01:47:51.98 --> 01:47:53.70
And I was like, I like, it's like,

2452
01:47:53.70 --> 01:47:56.62
if you drink coffee for the first time,

2453
01:47:56.62 --> 01:47:59.18
of course this is a thousand times better than coffee.

2454
01:47:59.18 --> 01:48:01.54
Dude, I don't drink coffee.

2455
01:48:01.54 --> 01:48:02.78
I did a spurt of five years.

2456
01:48:02.78 --> 01:48:05.66
I drank coffee in the beginning of Starting Origin.

2457
01:48:05.66 --> 01:48:06.98
I don't drink coffee though.

2458
01:48:06.98 --> 01:48:07.94
And then I never drank before

2459
01:48:07.94 --> 01:48:10.34
because I think coffee is disgusting.

2460
01:48:10.34 --> 01:48:11.50
I think it tastes bad.

2461
01:48:11.50 --> 01:48:12.98
I think it tastes really good

2462
01:48:12.98 --> 01:48:14.98
with a lot of sugar cubes and some milk

2463
01:48:14.98 --> 01:48:17.22
and maybe throw some whipped cream in there.

2464
01:48:17.22 --> 01:48:19.18
But that's not really coffee, you know what I'm saying?

2465
01:48:19.18 --> 01:48:24.18
So I really did like, and I actually drank mango,

2466
01:48:24.46 --> 01:48:26.46
is I drink a mango every day.

2467
01:48:26.46 --> 01:48:28.02
One can of mango every morning.

2468
01:48:28.02 --> 01:48:30.46
That was my best part of waking up,

2469
01:48:30.46 --> 01:48:32.82
was mango in my mouth, you know what I'm saying?

2470
01:48:32.82 --> 01:48:35.54
And I love the iced tea lemonade.

2471
01:48:35.54 --> 01:48:38.62
And that's what, so the old flavors were like this.

2472
01:48:38.62 --> 01:48:41.50
Usually people had one that they really liked.

2473
01:48:41.50 --> 01:48:42.62
Yes, I had one.

2474
01:48:42.62 --> 01:48:44.82
And they had two that they thought were okay.

2475
01:48:44.82 --> 01:48:47.38
And they had three that they literally didn't like at all,

2476
01:48:47.38 --> 01:48:49.38
which is not good, right?

2477
01:48:49.38 --> 01:48:52.50
So we knew we had to redo these flavors.

2478
01:48:52.50 --> 01:48:55.30
And what we ended up having to do is say,

2479
01:48:55.30 --> 01:48:57.86
hey, you know what, we need help.

2480
01:48:57.86 --> 01:48:58.86
We need help.

2481
01:48:58.86 --> 01:49:03.50
We've reached the maximum capacity of our capabilities

2482
01:49:03.50 --> 01:49:06.18
and reached out to professionals

2483
01:49:06.18 --> 01:49:08.86
that actually formulate flavors

2484
01:49:08.86 --> 01:49:12.10
and can help and help us put together

2485
01:49:12.10 --> 01:49:15.70
and reformulate the flavors on all the drinks.

2486
01:49:15.70 --> 01:49:19.06
And man, what a freaking difference.

2487
01:49:19.06 --> 01:49:22.38
I mean, the new flavors, all of them.

2488
01:49:22.38 --> 01:49:23.54
This is what it's like now.

2489
01:49:23.54 --> 01:49:26.98
You'll have three that you love

2490
01:49:26.98 --> 01:49:31.98
and you'll have four that you absolutely love almost as much.

2491
01:49:31.98 --> 01:49:34.42
I actually drink every single flavor.

2492
01:49:34.42 --> 01:49:36.42
They're all delicious now.

2493
01:49:36.42 --> 01:49:37.86
They're all delicious now.

2494
01:49:37.86 --> 01:49:41.06
So that was huge, but...

2495
01:49:41.06 --> 01:49:43.06
We had to destroy some flavors as well.

2496
01:49:43.06 --> 01:49:44.46
This is what's crazy, right?

2497
01:49:44.46 --> 01:49:46.46
It's not like you snap your fingers

2498
01:49:46.46 --> 01:49:47.90
and now you have new flavors.

2499
01:49:47.90 --> 01:49:50.90
No, this is a massive investment financially

2500
01:49:50.90 --> 01:49:52.94
to bring these new flavors around.

2501
01:49:52.94 --> 01:49:55.34
The testing, the, hey, no, this one sucks.

2502
01:49:55.34 --> 01:49:57.74
No, I want a little sweeter, less lime,

2503
01:49:57.74 --> 01:49:59.74
you know, more cherries.

2504
01:49:59.74 --> 01:50:02.18
All these things going back and forth,

2505
01:50:02.18 --> 01:50:05.18
paying to get all these things formulated.

2506
01:50:05.18 --> 01:50:06.42
And then once you get them formulated,

2507
01:50:06.42 --> 01:50:09.38
well, now you've got to adjust

2508
01:50:09.38 --> 01:50:11.22
all the cans that you've made.

2509
01:50:11.22 --> 01:50:13.22
And you've got some cans that are sitting around

2510
01:50:13.22 --> 01:50:14.82
that now what are we gonna do with these?

2511
01:50:14.82 --> 01:50:18.82
So this was a massive effort, a massive effort.

2512
01:50:20.02 --> 01:50:23.50
But, you know what, I remember the,

2513
01:50:23.50 --> 01:50:27.10
I don't want to say the dictum that I put out.

2514
01:50:27.10 --> 01:50:32.10
Like the commander's intent that I put out was,

2515
01:50:34.74 --> 01:50:36.54
we need to win on taste.

2516
01:50:36.54 --> 01:50:38.98
Like, look, we're winning on everything else.

2517
01:50:38.98 --> 01:50:39.82
Everything else.

2518
01:50:39.82 --> 01:50:41.82
We've got everyone else crushed.

2519
01:50:41.82 --> 01:50:42.82
We've got them.

2520
01:50:42.82 --> 01:50:44.42
No one can touch us.

2521
01:50:44.42 --> 01:50:45.50
We need to win on taste.

2522
01:50:45.50 --> 01:50:48.22
If it doesn't taste good, it doesn't matter.

2523
01:50:48.22 --> 01:50:49.78
And we did it.

2524
01:50:49.78 --> 01:50:50.66
We did it now.

2525
01:50:50.66 --> 01:50:51.74
We're winning on taste.

2526
01:50:51.74 --> 01:50:52.90
So now we're winning.

2527
01:50:52.90 --> 01:50:54.22
We got the best tasting.

2528
01:50:54.22 --> 01:50:55.22
We got the most efficient.

2529
01:50:55.22 --> 01:50:59.26
And now that means that right there

2530
01:50:59.26 --> 01:51:02.46
was the production of all the weapons right there.

2531
01:51:02.46 --> 01:51:04.34
That was the production of all the weapons

2532
01:51:04.34 --> 01:51:06.34
and all the battleships and all the aircraft carriers

2533
01:51:06.34 --> 01:51:07.18
and all the airplanes

2534
01:51:07.18 --> 01:51:09.30
and all the howitzers in World War II.

2535
01:51:09.30 --> 01:51:10.46
We made this.

2536
01:51:10.46 --> 01:51:11.50
And now they're out.

2537
01:51:11.50 --> 01:51:14.14
Now it's time to take them into battle.

2538
01:51:14.14 --> 01:51:19.14
And this is such a fascinating world.

2539
01:51:19.18 --> 01:51:22.94
This battle that goes on in the business world.

2540
01:51:22.94 --> 01:51:24.42
And I never knew about it.

2541
01:51:24.42 --> 01:51:26.98
I mean, I certainly didn't know about this three,

2542
01:51:26.98 --> 01:51:28.38
four years ago.

2543
01:51:28.38 --> 01:51:31.34
What's going on when you go into stores?

2544
01:51:31.34 --> 01:51:33.66
How that functions?

2545
01:51:33.66 --> 01:51:37.22
So you go into a store, you go into a convenience store.

2546
01:51:37.22 --> 01:51:42.22
And you see 20 different energy drinks

2547
01:51:42.58 --> 01:51:45.98
in the cooler, in the refrigerator.

2548
01:51:45.98 --> 01:51:50.46
And those energy drinks to get into that cooler

2549
01:51:50.46 --> 01:51:52.10
had to fight to get in there.

2550
01:51:52.10 --> 01:51:55.14
And what that means is they in many cases

2551
01:51:55.14 --> 01:51:56.90
had to pay to get in there.

2552
01:51:56.90 --> 01:52:01.82
They had to pay millions of dollars to get that shelf space.

2553
01:52:01.82 --> 01:52:04.82
And each one of those different brands

2554
01:52:04.82 --> 01:52:06.02
that you're looking at in there,

2555
01:52:06.02 --> 01:52:07.26
some of them have paid more,

2556
01:52:07.26 --> 01:52:09.74
some of them have paid less.

2557
01:52:09.74 --> 01:52:14.74
If you happen to have a drink that just performs great,

2558
01:52:16.02 --> 01:52:16.98
guess what?

2559
01:52:16.98 --> 01:52:19.46
They don't have to pay a bunch to get in there.

2560
01:52:19.46 --> 01:52:23.72
If you have something like Jocko Fuel where we do perform,

2561
01:52:24.82 --> 01:52:28.06
we haven't paid to get in there.

2562
01:52:28.06 --> 01:52:28.90
Yes.

2563
01:52:28.90 --> 01:52:31.98
We're getting by on actual performance.

2564
01:52:32.86 --> 01:52:35.90
And that's good because the amount of money

2565
01:52:35.90 --> 01:52:37.90
that gets thrown around in these deals,

2566
01:52:37.90 --> 01:52:40.22
we're talking about billion dollar companies,

2567
01:52:40.22 --> 01:52:42.06
multi-billion dollar companies.

2568
01:52:42.06 --> 01:52:44.46
So you got that war going on.

2569
01:52:44.46 --> 01:52:49.30
So that every space in that shelf

2570
01:52:49.30 --> 01:52:50.74
is fought for.

2571
01:52:50.74 --> 01:52:51.58
And you know what?

2572
01:52:51.58 --> 01:52:53.78
When you go in and you support,

2573
01:52:53.78 --> 01:52:56.10
you go in and you buy a Jocko Go from a convenience store,

2574
01:52:56.10 --> 01:52:57.78
you go into a grocery store and you buy it,

2575
01:52:57.78 --> 01:53:01.18
you are, you're calling for reinforcements.

2576
01:53:01.18 --> 01:53:04.38
You're opening up the gates for reinforcements

2577
01:53:04.38 --> 01:53:05.46
to get in there.

2578
01:53:05.46 --> 01:53:07.66
So when you do that, thank you for doing that.

2579
01:53:07.66 --> 01:53:09.30
Not only are you supporting yourself,

2580
01:53:09.30 --> 01:53:12.34
you're supporting the company,

2581
01:53:12.34 --> 01:53:13.54
which means you're supporting America.

2582
01:53:13.54 --> 01:53:14.58
So thank you for doing that.

2583
01:53:14.58 --> 01:53:16.38
So you got that war going on one front.

2584
01:53:16.38 --> 01:53:18.26
The other war is this virtual war

2585
01:53:18.26 --> 01:53:21.58
that you've got going on, which is insane.

2586
01:53:21.58 --> 01:53:26.58
So whether it's search words on Google

2587
01:53:27.22 --> 01:53:30.30
or searching in Amazon, see this is again,

2588
01:53:30.30 --> 01:53:33.42
bro they don't call it conquest for no reason.

2589
01:53:33.42 --> 01:53:35.14
There's term conquest.

2590
01:53:35.14 --> 01:53:36.30
You conquest somebody.

2591
01:53:36.30 --> 01:53:37.62
This is a war term.

2592
01:53:37.62 --> 01:53:39.66
This is where I started to understand

2593
01:53:39.66 --> 01:53:41.30
what was happening on Amazon.

2594
01:53:42.54 --> 01:53:44.38
You know, years ago, I'm at Ashlam Front

2595
01:53:44.38 --> 01:53:46.90
and I like certain kinds of pens

2596
01:53:46.90 --> 01:53:48.10
as stupid as that might sound.

2597
01:53:48.10 --> 01:53:49.98
You know I'm kind of a particular guy, I'll go Charles.

2598
01:53:49.98 --> 01:53:51.86
I like things a certain way, right?

2599
01:53:51.86 --> 01:53:53.46
There's one right there.

2600
01:53:53.46 --> 01:53:55.02
I like certain kinds of pens.

2601
01:53:55.02 --> 01:53:57.94
I like certain types of pencils.

2602
01:53:57.94 --> 01:54:00.02
I like certain types of paper.

2603
01:54:00.02 --> 01:54:03.26
So, you know, one time I was like ordering one of my pens.

2604
01:54:03.26 --> 01:54:07.22
This is, and I ain't no freaking Mont Blanc dude over here.

2605
01:54:07.22 --> 01:54:10.22
I'm not rolling on a $200 pen or whatever.

2606
01:54:10.22 --> 01:54:12.38
I like pens that cost $2.59.

2607
01:54:12.38 --> 01:54:16.38
So I order one pen for $2.59.

2608
01:54:16.38 --> 01:54:21.10
And Amazon says, yep, it'll be there tomorrow at your house.

2609
01:54:21.98 --> 01:54:24.42
So I'm thinking to myself, that's crazy.

2610
01:54:24.42 --> 01:54:25.46
I don't know how they're doing this.

2611
01:54:25.46 --> 01:54:29.06
It's gotta cost them.

2612
01:54:29.06 --> 01:54:30.50
How much does it cost for them to deliver

2613
01:54:30.50 --> 01:54:31.34
this thing to my house?

2614
01:54:31.34 --> 01:54:32.18
A lot more than $2.59.

2615
01:54:32.18 --> 01:54:33.14
A lot more than $2.59.

2616
01:54:33.14 --> 01:54:38.14
And what's their profit margin on $2.59 or $2.39?

2617
01:54:39.22 --> 01:54:41.46
What is it, $2.20?

2618
01:54:41.46 --> 01:54:43.26
It costs them $2 to get this thing to my door

2619
01:54:43.26 --> 01:54:45.22
at an absolute minimum.

2620
01:54:45.22 --> 01:54:47.90
So how in God's name are they making money?

2621
01:54:47.90 --> 01:54:49.42
How is that happening?

2622
01:54:49.42 --> 01:54:52.98
Well, when I searched pen,

2623
01:54:53.86 --> 01:54:56.30
there's 12 pens that come up

2624
01:54:56.30 --> 01:55:00.58
and each one of them is paying to pop up on my computer screen

2625
01:55:00.58 --> 01:55:03.10
and lure me into buying them.

2626
01:55:03.10 --> 01:55:06.94
And that's happening billions of times a day.

2627
01:55:06.94 --> 01:55:11.94
So there's this virtual war going on inside of Amazon.

2628
01:55:11.94 --> 01:55:16.94
And it was crazy as we put our products on Amazon

2629
01:55:17.62 --> 01:55:21.94
that if you searched Jocko protein,

2630
01:55:23.26 --> 01:55:25.34
before we understood the battlefield,

2631
01:55:25.34 --> 01:55:26.54
you'd search Jocko protein

2632
01:55:26.54 --> 01:55:29.14
and there would be nine proteins come up,

2633
01:55:29.14 --> 01:55:31.18
none of which would be Jocko fuel.

2634
01:55:32.10 --> 01:55:34.66
Or you'd search krill oil

2635
01:55:34.66 --> 01:55:36.86
and seven krill oils would pop up

2636
01:55:36.86 --> 01:55:39.06
and none of them would be Jocko fuel.

2637
01:55:39.06 --> 01:55:42.50
And this confused me for about four hours.

2638
01:55:42.50 --> 01:55:45.22
And then I said, hey, what in God's name is going on?

2639
01:55:45.22 --> 01:55:46.74
And guess what, people are paying.

2640
01:55:46.74 --> 01:55:49.22
And the word you just use is conquest.

2641
01:55:49.22 --> 01:55:51.50
Explain that, explain how that works.

2642
01:55:51.50 --> 01:55:54.86
I mean, we like to do it every now and then.

2643
01:55:54.86 --> 01:55:58.02
I mean, you gotta fight fire with fire a little bit,

2644
01:55:58.02 --> 01:56:01.78
but learning the landscape first of all

2645
01:56:01.78 --> 01:56:04.34
in obviously getting smart people involved

2646
01:56:04.34 --> 01:56:06.90
was key to our hiring process of getting,

2647
01:56:06.90 --> 01:56:08.86
I call it expanding the brain trust,

2648
01:56:08.86 --> 01:56:10.62
you know what I mean?

2649
01:56:10.62 --> 01:56:12.18
Basically it works like this.

2650
01:56:13.06 --> 01:56:18.06
You find smarter people and you algorithmically bid.

2651
01:56:20.46 --> 01:56:22.90
So if you have AI, that's even better

2652
01:56:22.90 --> 01:56:24.82
against your competitors

2653
01:56:24.82 --> 01:56:27.98
and then you conquest them by using their name.

2654
01:56:27.98 --> 01:56:31.02
So regardless if they're searching for you or searching

2655
01:56:31.02 --> 01:56:33.98
or using their brand name, you're coming up.

2656
01:56:33.98 --> 01:56:36.86
And that's the war, that's the war online.

2657
01:56:36.86 --> 01:56:39.18
100% and it's no different than in the stores

2658
01:56:39.18 --> 01:56:43.38
except that the companies, and we're in this war right now,

2659
01:56:43.38 --> 01:56:46.14
we're in this war in the store right now.

2660
01:56:46.14 --> 01:56:51.14
We have a company that is offering millions of dollars

2661
01:56:52.58 --> 01:56:57.14
for shelf space, which we need.

2662
01:56:59.14 --> 01:57:01.62
We can't fight that battle.

2663
01:57:01.62 --> 01:57:03.90
So we're working on some other techniques

2664
01:57:03.90 --> 01:57:06.90
which we won't share to flank it and stay

2665
01:57:06.90 --> 01:57:08.94
where we need to stay ultimately

2666
01:57:08.94 --> 01:57:13.18
and continue driving velocity to prove out what we're doing,

2667
01:57:13.18 --> 01:57:15.58
not just to the store, but to the consumer also.

2668
01:57:15.58 --> 01:57:17.54
So there's a lot of moving parts there.

2669
01:57:17.54 --> 01:57:21.58
Yeah, and the best thing, so here's a,

2670
01:57:21.58 --> 01:57:23.42
people talk to me for it in a bunch of books, right?

2671
01:57:23.42 --> 01:57:25.30
And people are like, oh, you know what's the key

2672
01:57:25.30 --> 01:57:27.26
to making New York Times bestseller?

2673
01:57:27.26 --> 01:57:29.22
What's the key to having a bestselling book?

2674
01:57:29.22 --> 01:57:32.34
And the key is write a good book.

2675
01:57:32.34 --> 01:57:33.62
That's the actual key.

2676
01:57:33.62 --> 01:57:36.90
So the best thing that we can do is what we've done,

2677
01:57:36.90 --> 01:57:38.58
make the best possible product,

2678
01:57:38.58 --> 01:57:40.58
make it taste as good as it possibly can.

2679
01:57:40.58 --> 01:57:43.54
And that is why we're in there in the first place.

2680
01:57:43.54 --> 01:57:48.54
We don't have the firepower to break through the door.

2681
01:57:50.26 --> 01:57:52.62
What gets us into all these different places

2682
01:57:52.62 --> 01:57:53.78
is the high demand signal.

2683
01:57:53.78 --> 01:57:55.34
So thank you all out there right now,

2684
01:57:55.34 --> 01:57:57.70
tuning in, listening going, hell yeah.

2685
01:57:57.70 --> 01:57:58.50
Clear the shelves.

2686
01:57:58.50 --> 01:57:59.70
Yes, clear the shelves.

2687
01:57:59.70 --> 01:58:00.54
You out there, clear the shelves.

2688
01:58:00.54 --> 01:58:03.50
That's literally what made this happen.

2689
01:58:03.50 --> 01:58:05.14
That's what keeps us going.

2690
01:58:05.14 --> 01:58:08.46
The product, the effectiveness of the product,

2691
01:58:08.46 --> 01:58:09.30
the taste of the product,

2692
01:58:09.30 --> 01:58:14.30
that's the number one weapon to make this happen.

2693
01:58:14.30 --> 01:58:17.14
But, and that's what we have to use,

2694
01:58:17.14 --> 01:58:18.58
is because that's what we have.

2695
01:58:18.58 --> 01:58:20.42
We don't have billions of dollars.

2696
01:58:20.42 --> 01:58:24.66
We can't throw tens of millions of dollars at a store

2697
01:58:24.66 --> 01:58:26.74
to say, can you give us a few more,

2698
01:58:26.74 --> 01:58:28.62
can you get rid of our competitor?

2699
01:58:28.62 --> 01:58:29.50
Because that's what happens.

2700
01:58:29.50 --> 01:58:31.02
And look, this is business.

2701
01:58:31.02 --> 01:58:32.66
This is business.

2702
01:58:32.66 --> 01:58:35.02
I get it and they can win.

2703
01:58:35.02 --> 01:58:36.34
I get that too.

2704
01:58:36.34 --> 01:58:38.58
You can understand Wally a little bit.

2705
01:58:38.58 --> 01:58:40.22
You can understand Wally's mindset

2706
01:58:40.22 --> 01:58:41.78
with his, that protective mindset.

2707
01:58:41.78 --> 01:58:43.54
We're doing the same thing.

2708
01:58:43.54 --> 01:58:45.54
You know, we're going to buy line time.

2709
01:58:45.54 --> 01:58:48.58
We're going to go buy, we're in the process of it.

2710
01:58:48.58 --> 01:58:51.90
We just secured 2025 line time for Moq RTDs.

2711
01:58:51.90 --> 01:58:54.78
2025, shit ain't even set up yet.

2712
01:58:54.78 --> 01:58:56.22
And we're going to own that.

2713
01:58:56.22 --> 01:58:57.06
Why?

2714
01:58:57.06 --> 01:58:58.26
Because you got to be a savage about it.

2715
01:58:58.26 --> 01:59:00.22
You got to protect what you're building.

2716
01:59:00.22 --> 01:59:04.90
So it is, it helps me understand his mindset

2717
01:59:04.90 --> 01:59:07.62
by our mindset with how we're building this.

2718
01:59:07.62 --> 01:59:08.46
Yep.

2719
01:59:08.46 --> 01:59:10.22
And you have to, like you just said,

2720
01:59:10.22 --> 01:59:13.14
you have to be a savage because if you're not,

2721
01:59:14.10 --> 01:59:15.54
you have to be a predator.

2722
01:59:15.54 --> 01:59:18.02
You have to go, you have to be a predator

2723
01:59:18.02 --> 01:59:19.18
because otherwise you'll get eaten.

2724
01:59:19.18 --> 01:59:20.98
You just look like prey.

2725
01:59:20.98 --> 01:59:25.34
And in these big companies, it's us down here,

2726
01:59:25.34 --> 01:59:27.02
you know, scrapping.

2727
01:59:27.02 --> 01:59:30.34
And they can just, you know, they can throw money at stuff.

2728
01:59:30.34 --> 01:59:31.62
And you know what?

2729
01:59:31.62 --> 01:59:33.02
And like I said, they can win.

2730
01:59:33.02 --> 01:59:35.26
That's the way things work.

2731
01:59:35.26 --> 01:59:38.50
But we also have advantages.

2732
01:59:38.50 --> 01:59:39.94
And that's what we're going to utilize.

2733
01:59:39.94 --> 01:59:42.74
You know, this is how insurgencies work.

2734
01:59:42.74 --> 01:59:46.70
How do small little gorillas running around in the jungle

2735
01:59:46.70 --> 01:59:49.70
defeat giant imperialist countries?

2736
01:59:49.70 --> 01:59:51.10
It's an insurgency.

2737
01:59:51.10 --> 01:59:52.34
There's belief.

2738
01:59:52.34 --> 01:59:54.74
There's belief in what's happening.

2739
01:59:54.74 --> 01:59:58.02
There's unity in the people.

2740
01:59:58.02 --> 01:59:59.26
That's what we have.

2741
01:59:59.26 --> 02:00:01.74
We have people that believe we have unity

2742
02:00:01.74 --> 02:00:02.90
and that's our strength.

2743
02:00:02.90 --> 02:00:06.82
And that's how we're going to win on that battlefield.

2744
02:00:06.82 --> 02:00:11.18
Now, meanwhile, again, while all this is going on,

2745
02:00:11.18 --> 02:00:14.18
which is a daily fight, a daily fight.

2746
02:00:15.90 --> 02:00:17.90
Meanwhile, we got this double merger going on.

2747
02:00:17.90 --> 02:00:20.66
And it's actually more of like a triple.

2748
02:00:20.66 --> 02:00:23.10
We have a triple merger going on

2749
02:00:23.10 --> 02:00:27.14
because now in North Carolina, what we end up with is

2750
02:00:27.14 --> 02:00:30.78
we have factory one that we bought.

2751
02:00:30.78 --> 02:00:33.82
Now we have, and it's not like factory one was bought

2752
02:00:33.82 --> 02:00:35.90
and now everyone, we've been there for long enough.

2753
02:00:35.90 --> 02:00:37.22
Now everyone's completely transitioned

2754
02:00:37.22 --> 02:00:39.46
into everyone understands what we're doing

2755
02:00:39.46 --> 02:00:43.34
and everyone's on board with the way our leadership works.

2756
02:00:43.34 --> 02:00:45.94
No, that's still going on.

2757
02:00:45.94 --> 02:00:47.86
Boom, now we buy another factory.

2758
02:00:48.94 --> 02:00:51.82
And now we have the origin culture, factory one

2759
02:00:51.82 --> 02:00:56.82
and factory two, all these cultures merging in one shot

2760
02:00:58.26 --> 02:00:59.18
at one time.

2761
02:00:59.18 --> 02:01:00.58
What's that looking like?

2762
02:01:00.58 --> 02:01:04.26
Well, don't forget and maybe you want to save this,

2763
02:01:04.26 --> 02:01:06.90
but while all this is going on,

2764
02:01:06.90 --> 02:01:10.10
we have this kind of aggressive and bold idea

2765
02:01:10.10 --> 02:01:14.22
of building an American made hunt line in this factory

2766
02:01:14.22 --> 02:01:16.42
that we're going to double merge together.

2767
02:01:17.70 --> 02:01:21.42
So I don't know if that's crazy.

2768
02:01:21.42 --> 02:01:24.26
It's a little bit crazy.

2769
02:01:24.26 --> 02:01:29.26
What we're trying to do is you're not right in the head.

2770
02:01:29.26 --> 02:01:31.38
I think that's what makes it all work

2771
02:01:31.38 --> 02:01:36.38
is other companies, they're not willing to pull out all stops.

2772
02:01:39.38 --> 02:01:43.30
It's not normal.

2773
02:01:44.26 --> 02:01:46.38
It's necessary though, like you said.

2774
02:01:46.38 --> 02:01:50.62
So double merger, trying to build culture

2775
02:01:50.62 --> 02:01:55.62
at the same time, developing textiles, developing a camo,

2776
02:01:55.74 --> 02:01:59.14
trying to get this wash house up so we can wash jeans,

2777
02:01:59.14 --> 02:02:01.78
developing new fits, hiring a product team,

2778
02:02:01.78 --> 02:02:03.10
getting the logistics figure out,

2779
02:02:03.10 --> 02:02:05.66
building out a new direct to consumer warehouse,

2780
02:02:05.66 --> 02:02:09.94
training people on that, hiring operators,

2781
02:02:09.94 --> 02:02:12.26
like hiring new C level executives,

2782
02:02:12.26 --> 02:02:16.46
having to have board meetings, expanding the finance team.

2783
02:02:16.46 --> 02:02:17.54
It's a lot.

2784
02:02:17.54 --> 02:02:20.70
It's a big ass wave, man.

2785
02:02:20.70 --> 02:02:25.70
I'm just like, and honestly from my perspective.

2786
02:02:25.82 --> 02:02:29.26
These monsters went from like Komodo dragons to Godzilla.

2787
02:02:29.26 --> 02:02:31.82
Yeah, 100% freaking weird.

2788
02:02:31.82 --> 02:02:35.38
Somebody said to me recently, man, you're hard work guys.

2789
02:02:35.38 --> 02:02:38.54
Actually, I will not outwork you.

2790
02:02:38.54 --> 02:02:40.02
I will out ADHD you.

2791
02:02:41.38 --> 02:02:42.82
That's it.

2792
02:02:42.82 --> 02:02:46.18
I got ADHD for days, man.

2793
02:02:46.18 --> 02:02:48.62
Like I can bounce around, but it gets to a point

2794
02:02:48.62 --> 02:02:51.98
where like you got to organize the chaos.

2795
02:02:51.98 --> 02:02:56.98
And you can use your ADHD, I can use it as a superpower,

2796
02:02:58.38 --> 02:03:01.66
but stepping back and like, hey,

2797
02:03:01.66 --> 02:03:05.58
letting people start to organize this chaos

2798
02:03:05.58 --> 02:03:06.82
into a machine.

2799
02:03:06.82 --> 02:03:09.14
It's like you got all these parts and pieces,

2800
02:03:09.14 --> 02:03:12.58
but like putting them together, dumping some oil,

2801
02:03:12.58 --> 02:03:16.74
putting the grease on and tuning it in and letting it run.

2802
02:03:16.74 --> 02:03:21.74
It's kind of where we're at right now is it's together,

2803
02:03:22.14 --> 02:03:23.82
but it's squeaking, man.

2804
02:03:23.82 --> 02:03:27.14
It's squeaking and we know what needs to be done,

2805
02:03:27.14 --> 02:03:29.58
but the biggest part of that is culture.

2806
02:03:29.58 --> 02:03:34.02
And honestly, it's on both sides of this two-headed monster.

2807
02:03:34.02 --> 02:03:37.98
Is keeping that consistent culture, driving it down.

2808
02:03:37.98 --> 02:03:39.90
I believe the most important thing you can have

2809
02:03:39.90 --> 02:03:41.54
in business is culture.

2810
02:03:41.54 --> 02:03:44.18
I think if you have good culture, you can do anything.

2811
02:03:44.18 --> 02:03:46.90
And we've seen that in a positive light and war,

2812
02:03:46.90 --> 02:03:50.62
and we've seen that in a very negative light and war.

2813
02:03:50.62 --> 02:03:53.14
If you can get buy-in from the people

2814
02:03:53.14 --> 02:03:58.14
and you can create a mission and a mindset around that mission

2815
02:03:59.34 --> 02:04:01.86
that people are willing to execute against

2816
02:04:01.86 --> 02:04:06.50
and go to war for, you can truly do anything.

2817
02:04:06.50 --> 02:04:08.70
You truly can do anything.

2818
02:04:08.70 --> 02:04:10.34
I've always believed that as a kid,

2819
02:04:10.34 --> 02:04:11.94
when they said you can be anything you wanna be.

2820
02:04:11.94 --> 02:04:12.90
You can do anything in life.

2821
02:04:12.90 --> 02:04:14.26
I actually believed that shit.

2822
02:04:14.26 --> 02:04:16.38
Maybe I was naive, but I believed it.

2823
02:04:16.38 --> 02:04:17.22
You know what I'm saying?

2824
02:04:17.22 --> 02:04:18.98
And I still do believe it.

2825
02:04:18.98 --> 02:04:23.54
So, I remember calling you up and being like,

2826
02:04:23.54 --> 02:04:25.06
and we don't need to share it here,

2827
02:04:25.06 --> 02:04:28.38
but like, hey, Jocko, we've got some problems.

2828
02:04:28.38 --> 02:04:31.46
We've got some problems trying to merge this thing together.

2829
02:04:31.46 --> 02:04:34.22
I shared some of those concerns with you

2830
02:04:34.22 --> 02:04:38.02
of that mindset from the 70s and 80s

2831
02:04:38.02 --> 02:04:42.82
that was really not gonna work and really not okay.

2832
02:04:45.26 --> 02:04:48.54
And at that point, obviously, you were like,

2833
02:04:48.54 --> 02:04:51.62
yeah, I'm freaking in, you know,

2834
02:04:51.62 --> 02:04:53.66
and getting the teams together,

2835
02:04:53.66 --> 02:04:55.66
feeding them, having a meal,

2836
02:04:55.66 --> 02:04:58.10
and then like showing them and going to town

2837
02:04:58.10 --> 02:05:01.18
on like who we are and what we're all about

2838
02:05:01.18 --> 02:05:03.86
and what culture means and what leadership means

2839
02:05:03.86 --> 02:05:06.62
and how to lead and how to communicate.

2840
02:05:06.62 --> 02:05:11.22
Like it's not like, and I know you've been down twice now

2841
02:05:11.22 --> 02:05:13.70
for the whole team, then for the management team.

2842
02:05:13.70 --> 02:05:18.38
I believe it's gonna take like some people going to Musters,

2843
02:05:18.38 --> 02:05:21.18
some of you coming back to the factory,

2844
02:05:21.18 --> 02:05:23.62
you know, like it's gonna take this constant alignment

2845
02:05:23.62 --> 02:05:26.14
over the course of 24 months.

2846
02:05:26.14 --> 02:05:28.22
That's how long the double merger is gonna take.

2847
02:05:28.22 --> 02:05:32.06
Yeah, yeah, and that's pretty standard, right?

2848
02:05:32.06 --> 02:05:32.90
I don't know, man.

2849
02:05:32.90 --> 02:05:34.62
You tell me, I mean, your business is all the time.

2850
02:05:34.62 --> 02:05:35.46
I don't know.

2851
02:05:35.46 --> 02:05:36.30
I am telling you, yeah.

2852
02:05:36.30 --> 02:05:38.22
I'm with the trenches a little bit.

2853
02:05:38.22 --> 02:05:39.38
It's not an oculation.

2854
02:05:39.38 --> 02:05:40.54
You don't go to a one-no,

2855
02:05:40.54 --> 02:05:41.82
Jocke would talk about extreme ownership,

2856
02:05:41.82 --> 02:05:43.46
okay, cool, now I get it, now we can move on.

2857
02:05:43.46 --> 02:05:44.90
This doesn't work like that.

2858
02:05:45.90 --> 02:05:50.78
But what is beautiful is you can see progress.

2859
02:05:50.78 --> 02:05:55.50
I mean, you mentioned about Jason's progress

2860
02:05:55.50 --> 02:05:57.18
as his mind opened up,

2861
02:05:57.18 --> 02:06:01.46
as he started to understand other ways to lead

2862
02:06:01.46 --> 02:06:04.74
and get out of just a survival mode, which is a good thing,

2863
02:06:04.74 --> 02:06:08.18
but it's not as good as a build and thrive

2864
02:06:08.18 --> 02:06:09.78
and takeover mode, right?

2865
02:06:09.78 --> 02:06:11.10
That's the thing.

2866
02:06:11.10 --> 02:06:14.02
And just like a really simple thing.

2867
02:06:14.02 --> 02:06:17.82
When I talked to the team in North Carolina,

2868
02:06:17.82 --> 02:06:22.82
just explaining to them that leadership wanted their feedback.

2869
02:06:25.30 --> 02:06:26.86
Leadership wanted their feedback.

2870
02:06:26.86 --> 02:06:29.22
Leadership wanted to know if there was something

2871
02:06:29.22 --> 02:06:30.42
on the line that didn't make sense.

2872
02:06:30.42 --> 02:06:31.34
And I remember asking, you know,

2873
02:06:31.34 --> 02:06:32.66
something along the lines of like,

2874
02:06:32.66 --> 02:06:37.38
who here thinks Jason knows how to hem that thing

2875
02:06:37.38 --> 02:06:39.66
better than the person that sits on the machine all day?

2876
02:06:39.66 --> 02:06:41.70
Everyone's like, of course, the person on the machine.

2877
02:06:41.70 --> 02:06:44.62
So if Jason's telling you to do something the wrong way,

2878
02:06:44.62 --> 02:06:46.62
doesn't it make sense that you say,

2879
02:06:46.62 --> 02:06:48.42
hey, this doesn't work or here's a better way to do it?

2880
02:06:48.42 --> 02:06:49.26
Yes.

2881
02:06:49.26 --> 02:06:54.26
And like the light on their faces was a beautiful thing to see

2882
02:06:54.42 --> 02:06:56.58
because you can see that they do have ideas

2883
02:06:56.58 --> 02:06:58.30
and they have better ways of doing things

2884
02:06:58.30 --> 02:06:59.90
and they can definitely help us improve

2885
02:06:59.90 --> 02:07:03.10
and they will help us and they are helping us improve.

2886
02:07:03.10 --> 02:07:05.50
And of course, you still have to power through the fact

2887
02:07:05.50 --> 02:07:07.70
that they've been underneath leadership

2888
02:07:07.70 --> 02:07:09.10
that didn't do that for a long time.

2889
02:07:09.10 --> 02:07:10.66
It was like, hey, you're gonna do what we say,

2890
02:07:10.66 --> 02:07:12.30
we don't wanna hear from you.

2891
02:07:12.30 --> 02:07:14.70
So this is where things start to change.

2892
02:07:14.70 --> 02:07:17.26
And Jason says he getting that feedback that he needs.

2893
02:07:17.26 --> 02:07:19.54
So no, there's not gonna be an overnight transition.

2894
02:07:19.54 --> 02:07:21.02
That's not gonna happen.

2895
02:07:21.02 --> 02:07:24.50
But what's beautiful is that transition is already happening.

2896
02:07:24.50 --> 02:07:26.14
You already see the improvement.

2897
02:07:26.14 --> 02:07:27.90
You already see the attitude.

2898
02:07:27.90 --> 02:07:30.78
The difference between when I went down there the first time

2899
02:07:30.78 --> 02:07:32.06
and I went down there the second time,

2900
02:07:32.06 --> 02:07:34.58
a couple months apart, radically different.

2901
02:07:34.58 --> 02:07:35.94
Radically different situation.

2902
02:07:35.94 --> 02:07:38.26
You can see the difference on the floor.

2903
02:07:38.26 --> 02:07:40.26
You can see the people smiling.

2904
02:07:40.26 --> 02:07:42.22
You can see them looking, wanting to show me something,

2905
02:07:42.22 --> 02:07:43.14
wanting me to look at this.

2906
02:07:43.14 --> 02:07:45.26
So come and look, that's what you see.

2907
02:07:45.26 --> 02:07:48.22
And that's just like, that's where we're going.

2908
02:07:48.22 --> 02:07:50.06
That's the culture starting to grow.

2909
02:07:50.06 --> 02:07:52.98
And the other thing is you can't impose culture, right?

2910
02:07:52.98 --> 02:07:54.74
You can't say, okay, here's the new culture.

2911
02:07:54.74 --> 02:07:56.46
A through Z.

2912
02:07:56.46 --> 02:07:59.94
No, it has to all go into the pot.

2913
02:07:59.94 --> 02:08:02.54
And we have to cook it together and they have to realize

2914
02:08:02.54 --> 02:08:03.46
and there's gonna be some things

2915
02:08:03.46 --> 02:08:05.34
that they're gonna give to us.

2916
02:08:05.34 --> 02:08:08.78
And so that's the beautiful thing is to watch this thing.

2917
02:08:08.78 --> 02:08:10.58
Watch that unfold.

2918
02:08:11.94 --> 02:08:13.50
Huntline.

2919
02:08:13.50 --> 02:08:17.90
So first of all, you being in Maine,

2920
02:08:17.90 --> 02:08:20.94
being in the woods of Maine,

2921
02:08:20.94 --> 02:08:22.42
hunting is a way of life up here.

2922
02:08:22.42 --> 02:08:26.42
So a way of life, I know Joe, your father-in-law,

2923
02:08:26.42 --> 02:08:28.18
he's a hunter, you're a hunter.

2924
02:08:28.18 --> 02:08:31.38
I remember your son out running trap lines.

2925
02:08:31.38 --> 02:08:33.78
Like this is the way of life in Maine.

2926
02:08:33.78 --> 02:08:35.78
So for hunting, for you, it was like,

2927
02:08:35.78 --> 02:08:37.42
oh yeah, this is a no-brainer.

2928
02:08:37.42 --> 02:08:39.94
Yeah, I mean, a total no-brainer.

2929
02:08:39.94 --> 02:08:43.94
And that community's also, they're also patriots

2930
02:08:43.94 --> 02:08:47.70
and they heavily believe in the land.

2931
02:08:48.78 --> 02:08:50.54
They heavily believe in America.

2932
02:08:50.54 --> 02:08:55.54
And the fact that they don't have an option

2933
02:08:56.78 --> 02:09:01.66
that is made here with textiles that were made here,

2934
02:09:01.66 --> 02:09:04.18
like the fact that there's no option anymore.

2935
02:09:04.18 --> 02:09:06.62
We actually, in my last company in the early 2000s,

2936
02:09:06.62 --> 02:09:08.70
we actually manufactured, I mean,

2937
02:09:08.70 --> 02:09:10.30
we did marketing for this company.

2938
02:09:10.30 --> 02:09:14.38
It's called Beagle Ware and they did a wool.

2939
02:09:14.38 --> 02:09:16.62
And I still wear that hunting.

2940
02:09:16.62 --> 02:09:18.18
And I don't hunt a lot anymore

2941
02:09:18.18 --> 02:09:22.62
because I'm trying to feed two monsters seven days a week.

2942
02:09:24.50 --> 02:09:26.74
But I remember, that's what I still wear hunting right now

2943
02:09:26.74 --> 02:09:30.34
is I wear this wool Beagle Ware, which has a DWR on it.

2944
02:09:30.34 --> 02:09:32.34
Freakin' stuff is phenomenal.

2945
02:09:32.34 --> 02:09:34.30
That for me was always like the pinnacle

2946
02:09:34.30 --> 02:09:37.74
of hunting gear made in America, made in Vermont.

2947
02:09:39.30 --> 02:09:41.90
To bring this to fruition and to bring a product

2948
02:09:41.90 --> 02:09:44.78
at the level we've brought it to

2949
02:09:44.78 --> 02:09:49.78
on an American supply chain is, it's a little bit

2950
02:09:51.74 --> 02:09:54.22
of a miracle that we did it.

2951
02:09:54.22 --> 02:09:57.22
And I'll tell you what, if we didn't have the team we did

2952
02:09:57.22 --> 02:10:00.74
and the vision we had, and honestly with Kip involved

2953
02:10:00.74 --> 02:10:04.74
and his knowledge base of building Under Armour

2954
02:10:04.74 --> 02:10:09.74
and him keeping us away from making tuition payments,

2955
02:10:09.94 --> 02:10:11.94
I don't think it would have happened without Kip.

2956
02:10:11.94 --> 02:10:12.78
I don't.

2957
02:10:12.78 --> 02:10:16.34
Well, yeah, it would not have, not even don't think.

2958
02:10:16.34 --> 02:10:18.22
We would not have done it without Kip.

2959
02:10:18.22 --> 02:10:21.66
Exactly, so a big advocate there

2960
02:10:21.66 --> 02:10:25.06
and really driving how things should go.

2961
02:10:25.06 --> 02:10:28.42
And it's been, for me, it's been a year of learning.

2962
02:10:28.42 --> 02:10:33.10
Yeah, I'm kind of directing both organizations,

2963
02:10:33.10 --> 02:10:38.10
both monsters, but he's been there really calling out,

2964
02:10:40.30 --> 02:10:42.50
really calling it out in the Kip way.

2965
02:10:42.50 --> 02:10:43.34
You know what I mean?

2966
02:10:43.34 --> 02:10:46.30
Which is a little bit savage at times.

2967
02:10:46.30 --> 02:10:48.34
I've just kind of kept my mouth shut and executed.

2968
02:10:48.34 --> 02:10:50.98
So I've been, I feel like a little bit,

2969
02:10:50.98 --> 02:10:55.98
I've been just working for him on the Hunt line.

2970
02:10:56.02 --> 02:10:58.02
You know, I'm like working, I'm working for him.

2971
02:10:58.02 --> 02:11:00.66
And I'm totally okay with that.

2972
02:11:00.66 --> 02:11:04.70
Like that dude is, he's been driving this thing,

2973
02:11:04.70 --> 02:11:08.74
but understanding his thought process

2974
02:11:08.74 --> 02:11:10.38
of how to build product.

2975
02:11:10.38 --> 02:11:12.18
And I'm not just talking about Hunt,

2976
02:11:12.18 --> 02:11:16.02
but the thought process of how to build great product

2977
02:11:16.02 --> 02:11:19.70
with innovation, how to think about supply chains

2978
02:11:19.70 --> 02:11:24.06
and logistics, how to communicate with partners.

2979
02:11:24.06 --> 02:11:28.18
You know, how to build relationships that are lasting,

2980
02:11:28.18 --> 02:11:30.70
how to talk to consumers.

2981
02:11:32.74 --> 02:11:37.02
I feel like I've had a college education

2982
02:11:37.02 --> 02:11:37.86
over the past year.

2983
02:11:37.86 --> 02:11:39.18
It's been freaking phenomenal.

2984
02:11:39.18 --> 02:11:41.58
He's gonna hell a lot more than a college education.

2985
02:11:41.58 --> 02:11:44.66
Because Kip has this experience that you just,

2986
02:11:44.66 --> 02:11:46.70
you're just not, you can't, you could never,

2987
02:11:48.10 --> 02:11:50.34
you can't learn what Kip knows.

2988
02:11:50.34 --> 02:11:54.30
You can't learn that from a book or from a seminar

2989
02:11:54.30 --> 02:11:56.70
or from a college course, like ever.

2990
02:11:56.70 --> 02:11:58.98
You cannot learn what he knows.

2991
02:11:58.98 --> 02:12:00.90
You have to have lived it.

2992
02:12:00.90 --> 02:12:04.18
And I actually told him last week on the phone,

2993
02:12:04.18 --> 02:12:05.58
I was like, man, you gotta get ahold of Jocko

2994
02:12:05.58 --> 02:12:06.42
and you got it.

2995
02:12:06.42 --> 02:12:09.46
Cause I've been trying to push him to like write a book

2996
02:12:09.46 --> 02:12:12.06
under the armor, like and to tell the stories.

2997
02:12:12.06 --> 02:12:13.94
And I'm like, Jocko can publish that shit, dude.

2998
02:12:13.94 --> 02:12:16.38
Like, dude, call him and talk to him about it.

2999
02:12:16.38 --> 02:12:19.10
But also like start a YouTube channel

3000
02:12:19.10 --> 02:12:21.70
and Kip's a bit of a savage, you know what I mean?

3001
02:12:21.70 --> 02:12:24.46
The way he talks, he's just different.

3002
02:12:24.46 --> 02:12:25.34
He different.

3003
02:12:27.42 --> 02:12:30.06
But a super positive influence

3004
02:12:30.06 --> 02:12:32.70
on what we're doing as an organization.

3005
02:12:32.70 --> 02:12:34.46
Building this hunt line wasn't easy.

3006
02:12:34.46 --> 02:12:36.76
The Alpha Bravo Charlie layering system,

3007
02:12:36.76 --> 02:12:39.34
the way we're using wool, you know,

3008
02:12:39.34 --> 02:12:41.06
which is really core to who we are,

3009
02:12:41.06 --> 02:12:44.94
is this natural fiber in our nano wool

3010
02:12:44.94 --> 02:12:47.22
and our base layer and our stealth wool

3011
02:12:47.22 --> 02:12:48.34
and mid layer.

3012
02:12:48.34 --> 02:12:49.62
FYI, yeah.

3013
02:12:49.62 --> 02:12:52.06
It's not your dad's wool.

3014
02:12:52.06 --> 02:12:53.26
It's not your granddad's wool.

3015
02:12:53.26 --> 02:12:55.22
No, it's a totally different kind of wool.

3016
02:12:55.22 --> 02:12:58.54
Fine micron American marina wool to be exact.

3017
02:12:58.54 --> 02:13:00.58
It doesn't feel like, well, I don't know,

3018
02:13:00.58 --> 02:13:03.10
Echo, do you, how old are you, 44?

3019
02:13:03.10 --> 02:13:03.94
Yes, sir.

3020
02:13:03.94 --> 02:13:04.78
Oh yeah.

3021
02:13:04.78 --> 02:13:05.62
Well, I was gonna ask you a question about wool

3022
02:13:05.62 --> 02:13:07.62
and I remembered you're from Hawaii.

3023
02:13:07.62 --> 02:13:09.20
That's true.

3024
02:13:09.20 --> 02:13:13.06
You didn't wear anything wool growing up ever.

3025
02:13:13.06 --> 02:13:13.90
No.

3026
02:13:13.90 --> 02:13:15.02
Never.

3027
02:13:15.02 --> 02:13:15.86
All right.

3028
02:13:15.86 --> 02:13:18.34
You know, we didn't have our wool available yet

3029
02:13:18.34 --> 02:13:22.30
for me to test and I had to go to Europe a few weeks ago

3030
02:13:22.30 --> 02:13:23.34
and we were gonna go, actually,

3031
02:13:23.34 --> 02:13:25.02
and then we went to Scotland.

3032
02:13:25.02 --> 02:13:28.30
And so I bought a smart wool, you know that brand.

3033
02:13:28.30 --> 02:13:30.42
I bought some socks.

3034
02:13:30.42 --> 02:13:31.42
Dude.

3035
02:13:31.42 --> 02:13:34.78
I wear those socks during like all temperatures.

3036
02:13:34.78 --> 02:13:38.50
I didn't get it what like marina wool did

3037
02:13:38.50 --> 02:13:40.22
to regulate your body.

3038
02:13:40.22 --> 02:13:42.26
My feet don't sweat in it.

3039
02:13:42.26 --> 02:13:44.26
It doesn't make sense.

3040
02:13:44.26 --> 02:13:47.50
It doesn't make sense how this natural fiber

3041
02:13:47.50 --> 02:13:52.34
that's so old can be used still very innovative.

3042
02:13:52.34 --> 02:13:53.18
You know what I mean?

3043
02:13:53.18 --> 02:13:55.26
Like it's an incredible fiber.

3044
02:13:55.26 --> 02:14:00.26
So, you know, we leveraged this fine micron marina wool.

3045
02:14:01.42 --> 02:14:02.50
We blended it.

3046
02:14:02.50 --> 02:14:04.34
We produced these incredible textiles.

3047
02:14:04.34 --> 02:14:08.22
We gleaned some of the knowledge from spec ops, you know,

3048
02:14:08.22 --> 02:14:10.46
that hasn't been commercialized yet.

3049
02:14:11.62 --> 02:14:13.78
And we put this incredible line together.

3050
02:14:13.78 --> 02:14:17.46
Freakin' printed, roller printed, sublimated,

3051
02:14:17.46 --> 02:14:21.30
acid printed, like badass textiles that we're cutting

3052
02:14:21.30 --> 02:14:24.30
and sewing and turning into freaking America.

3053
02:14:24.30 --> 02:14:28.06
America's first truly American made hunt line

3054
02:14:28.06 --> 02:14:30.42
without compromise on the origin factory blockchain.

3055
02:14:30.42 --> 02:14:33.02
There is not another company doing that.

3056
02:14:33.02 --> 02:14:35.06
I'm giving you what anybody says.

3057
02:14:35.06 --> 02:14:36.70
Yeah, there's something.

3058
02:14:36.70 --> 02:14:37.74
When you mentioned the spec ops

3059
02:14:37.74 --> 02:14:39.38
and military base of this year,

3060
02:14:39.38 --> 02:14:42.82
there's something called Berry compliant.

3061
02:14:42.82 --> 02:14:45.78
So Berry was a representative or something

3062
02:14:45.78 --> 02:14:50.78
and he created a law where military had the deal,

3063
02:14:50.98 --> 02:14:52.74
the defense department had to purchase stuff

3064
02:14:52.74 --> 02:14:54.10
that was American made.

3065
02:14:54.10 --> 02:14:56.94
And it includes a whole bunch of different things.

3066
02:14:56.94 --> 02:14:58.38
You know, metal made products,

3067
02:14:58.38 --> 02:15:00.34
but textiles and clothing is one of them.

3068
02:15:00.34 --> 02:15:03.82
And it's probably the biggest category.

3069
02:15:03.82 --> 02:15:08.22
And so these things exist.

3070
02:15:08.22 --> 02:15:09.58
If it wasn't for that, honestly,

3071
02:15:09.58 --> 02:15:10.66
this stuff probably wouldn't exist

3072
02:15:10.66 --> 02:15:12.22
and we would have had to build a freaking mill

3073
02:15:12.22 --> 02:15:14.06
because the mill, there wouldn't even be mills here.

3074
02:15:14.06 --> 02:15:15.82
We would have probably had to build a mill

3075
02:15:15.82 --> 02:15:17.46
and make the stuff ourselves.

3076
02:15:17.46 --> 02:15:19.22
But luckily that did exist.

3077
02:15:19.22 --> 02:15:22.10
So thank you, Representative Berry,

3078
02:15:22.10 --> 02:15:24.66
for wherever you may be for putting that law into place

3079
02:15:24.66 --> 02:15:27.26
because it kept some level of manufacturing here.

3080
02:15:27.26 --> 02:15:30.26
So we were able to get a hold of that material

3081
02:15:30.26 --> 02:15:31.70
and utilize that material.

3082
02:15:31.70 --> 02:15:33.94
That's outstanding material.

3083
02:15:35.94 --> 02:15:39.50
It's available, but it's hard.

3084
02:15:39.50 --> 02:15:42.18
And where they get away with some of the stuff

3085
02:15:42.18 --> 02:15:44.06
is like the Berry Laws,

3086
02:15:44.06 --> 02:15:47.50
it says some exceptions are due to unavailability,

3087
02:15:47.50 --> 02:15:50.98
cost or manufacturing efficiencies of US based products.

3088
02:15:50.98 --> 02:15:52.58
So there's a claim that people can make,

3089
02:15:52.58 --> 02:15:55.58
well, you know, we can't quite make that type of zipper.

3090
02:15:55.58 --> 02:15:57.10
So we're gonna get it overseas.

3091
02:15:57.10 --> 02:15:59.98
But we can't make this type of nylon.

3092
02:15:59.98 --> 02:16:01.18
So we're gonna get it overseas.

3093
02:16:01.18 --> 02:16:02.38
Or it's gonna cost too much.

3094
02:16:02.38 --> 02:16:03.98
It's literally it costs too much.

3095
02:16:03.98 --> 02:16:05.06
So we're gonna do it overseas.

3096
02:16:05.06 --> 02:16:06.86
So there's ways that people get around it

3097
02:16:06.86 --> 02:16:09.06
and they can still call it Berry compliant.

3098
02:16:09.06 --> 02:16:10.62
We're better than Berry compliant.

3099
02:16:10.62 --> 02:16:13.54
Better than Berry, and that's what we externally,

3100
02:16:13.54 --> 02:16:14.86
like on our website,

3101
02:16:14.86 --> 02:16:17.94
we have to say for the consumer something.

3102
02:16:17.94 --> 02:16:20.46
So we say Berry compliant internally,

3103
02:16:20.46 --> 02:16:22.26
we're better than Berry.

3104
02:16:22.26 --> 02:16:24.06
Let me give you an example.

3105
02:16:24.06 --> 02:16:28.46
You know, there's a company in Maine that makes boots.

3106
02:16:28.46 --> 02:16:33.38
And their uppers, the full upper of the boot,

3107
02:16:33.38 --> 02:16:35.90
which is the boot without the sole,

3108
02:16:35.90 --> 02:16:39.62
comes in from Mexico and they call, they bottom it.

3109
02:16:39.62 --> 02:16:40.82
That's what it's called bottoming.

3110
02:16:40.82 --> 02:16:44.78
So they put a sole on it and they put laces in it.

3111
02:16:44.78 --> 02:16:46.14
And it's American made.

3112
02:16:47.54 --> 02:16:51.46
That technically is Berry compliant, right?

3113
02:16:51.46 --> 02:16:54.30
Internally, we are better than Berry.

3114
02:16:54.30 --> 02:16:58.58
That's a big deal to say that, hey man,

3115
02:16:58.58 --> 02:17:01.66
when you buy a pair of boots, that sole,

3116
02:17:01.66 --> 02:17:04.06
that came actually from Massachusetts,

3117
02:17:04.06 --> 02:17:06.42
from Vibram, they injected it there.

3118
02:17:06.42 --> 02:17:08.42
That leather came from Wisconsin.

3119
02:17:08.42 --> 02:17:09.66
Those eyelids came from here.

3120
02:17:09.66 --> 02:17:12.86
Like it all, like that poor on midsole on the jeans,

3121
02:17:12.86 --> 02:17:14.66
that cotton was grown by a Texas.

3122
02:17:14.66 --> 02:17:15.74
That rivet.

3123
02:17:15.74 --> 02:17:17.14
That rivet, yeah exactly.

3124
02:17:17.14 --> 02:17:18.50
That zipper, that thread.

3125
02:17:18.50 --> 02:17:21.98
So better than Berry is what we stand by internally.

3126
02:17:21.98 --> 02:17:26.06
And that's the only way that we continue

3127
02:17:26.06 --> 02:17:28.54
building the limited supply chains

3128
02:17:28.54 --> 02:17:33.54
and helping everybody, everybody that touches

3129
02:17:34.06 --> 02:17:37.42
any part of that product, any component.

3130
02:17:37.42 --> 02:17:38.78
That's how we rebuild the communities.

3131
02:17:38.78 --> 02:17:40.06
That's how we build the supply chain.

3132
02:17:40.06 --> 02:17:41.30
That's how we build America.

3133
02:17:41.30 --> 02:17:45.18
Yeah, and this, you mentioned that hunters

3134
02:17:45.18 --> 02:17:50.18
are probably the most patriotic people in this country

3135
02:17:50.18 --> 02:17:51.58
as a whole, right?

3136
02:17:51.58 --> 02:17:53.66
And that's one of the things that,

3137
02:17:53.66 --> 02:17:55.50
in talking to Cam Haynes, right?

3138
02:17:55.50 --> 02:17:59.82
I mean, just a world renowned hunter.

3139
02:18:01.18 --> 02:18:06.18
He was looking for what he's gonna wear when he hunts.

3140
02:18:07.58 --> 02:18:09.58
He needed someone to come on board with him.

3141
02:18:09.58 --> 02:18:12.18
He needed someone to support him in his efforts.

3142
02:18:12.18 --> 02:18:14.62
And he could go with any company in the world.

3143
02:18:14.62 --> 02:18:19.62
I mean, he's one of the best, if not the best.

3144
02:18:19.62 --> 02:18:24.34
Certainly the most popular of hunters.

3145
02:18:24.34 --> 02:18:28.50
And, you know, when, and luckily, of course,

3146
02:18:28.50 --> 02:18:30.74
he hunts with Kip, right?

3147
02:18:30.74 --> 02:18:33.62
He hunts with Kip and they're great friends.

3148
02:18:33.62 --> 02:18:35.86
And so that's awesome.

3149
02:18:35.86 --> 02:18:39.70
But still, like he's a guy that's got, you know,

3150
02:18:39.70 --> 02:18:41.26
a family to support in a whole nine yards.

3151
02:18:41.26 --> 02:18:43.42
So it's not just about, oh, well, this is my buddy.

3152
02:18:43.42 --> 02:18:44.26
So we're going.

3153
02:18:44.26 --> 02:18:49.26
Man, what, when I talked to Cam, you know,

3154
02:18:49.74 --> 02:18:54.18
when I talked to Cam, what I talked to him about was,

3155
02:18:54.18 --> 02:18:56.06
was we're doing this in America, you know,

3156
02:18:56.06 --> 02:18:58.50
and he's got a son that's in the Rangers.

3157
02:18:58.50 --> 02:19:01.42
I mean, this, you know, he's a patriotic hard working

3158
02:19:01.42 --> 02:19:03.78
American, he's a, he's a, he's a blue collar guy

3159
02:19:03.78 --> 02:19:05.98
that's worked his ass off.

3160
02:19:05.98 --> 02:19:06.98
And he knows what that means.

3161
02:19:06.98 --> 02:19:07.82
He knows what it's like.

3162
02:19:07.82 --> 02:19:11.26
He knows what it means to supply jobs to other Americans.

3163
02:19:11.26 --> 02:19:13.54
And, you know, from my perspective,

3164
02:19:13.54 --> 02:19:15.70
and then look, it was also, hey, you're going to be,

3165
02:19:15.70 --> 02:19:18.62
have a huge influence over what we make and how we make it.

3166
02:19:18.62 --> 02:19:19.58
This is going to be designed.

3167
02:19:19.58 --> 02:19:20.74
This is going to have your blessing.

3168
02:19:20.74 --> 02:19:23.82
And as Cam's blessing, you know, what else do we want?

3169
02:19:23.82 --> 02:19:24.66
Right?

3170
02:19:24.66 --> 02:19:29.66
So, but it was awesome to be able to get Cam involved,

3171
02:19:30.14 --> 02:19:32.22
to bring Cam on as an owner.

3172
02:19:33.42 --> 02:19:37.70
Because the reason is, look, he's not going to compromise

3173
02:19:37.70 --> 02:19:38.58
on performance.

3174
02:19:38.58 --> 02:19:39.70
It's not happening.

3175
02:19:39.70 --> 02:19:40.86
I mean, look at this dude.

3176
02:19:40.86 --> 02:19:43.66
He's running, he's running the marathon every day, right?

3177
02:19:43.66 --> 02:19:45.94
There's no compromise on performance with Cam.

3178
02:19:45.94 --> 02:19:48.02
So he's not going to compromise there.

3179
02:19:48.02 --> 02:19:50.34
And he's not going to compromise on his patriotism,

3180
02:19:50.34 --> 02:19:51.94
on his love for this country.

3181
02:19:51.94 --> 02:19:54.74
And, you know, I mean, I talked about it with him.

3182
02:19:54.74 --> 02:19:57.22
I'm like, hey, when we, when we buy stuff

3183
02:19:57.22 --> 02:19:59.90
from other countries, we're putting money

3184
02:19:59.90 --> 02:20:03.14
into the pockets of our adversaries.

3185
02:20:03.14 --> 02:20:04.62
Yes.

3186
02:20:04.62 --> 02:20:07.02
And that's a horrible thing.

3187
02:20:07.02 --> 02:20:08.90
And that's just, this is the way it is, man.

3188
02:20:08.90 --> 02:20:10.06
That's just the way it is.

3189
02:20:10.06 --> 02:20:12.46
And there's no two ways about that.

3190
02:20:12.46 --> 02:20:14.58
This, that's what we, this is an economic war.

3191
02:20:14.58 --> 02:20:18.66
And the, that, that claim, that's not just rhetoric,

3192
02:20:18.66 --> 02:20:19.98
like, oh, this is an economic war,

3193
02:20:19.98 --> 02:20:23.14
but no, no, this is an actual economic war.

3194
02:20:24.14 --> 02:20:25.78
And our adversaries are fighting.

3195
02:20:25.78 --> 02:20:28.22
And sometimes, you know, even if you look at,

3196
02:20:28.22 --> 02:20:33.22
at China's past and what, what their theories of war are,

3197
02:20:34.86 --> 02:20:37.46
what Sun Tzu said about war, they want to fight

3198
02:20:37.46 --> 02:20:40.98
without their opponent knowing that there's a war going on.

3199
02:20:40.98 --> 02:20:42.18
That's what they want.

3200
02:20:43.38 --> 02:20:45.94
So of course they don't make a big deal out of it,

3201
02:20:45.94 --> 02:20:47.70
but that's what's happening.

3202
02:20:47.70 --> 02:20:52.10
And, and so it was awesome to have Cam come on board

3203
02:20:52.10 --> 02:20:55.54
to a company that didn't even exist, you know?

3204
02:20:55.54 --> 02:20:56.78
Didn't even exist.

3205
02:20:58.38 --> 02:21:00.62
But for him to know, you know what?

3206
02:21:00.62 --> 02:21:02.42
This is the right thing to do.

3207
02:21:02.42 --> 02:21:06.58
And so thanks to Cam and, and for coming on board

3208
02:21:06.58 --> 02:21:09.90
and then helping with the design has been freaking awesome.

3209
02:21:09.90 --> 02:21:10.74
And it's been cool.

3210
02:21:10.74 --> 02:21:12.30
He's already out there hunting right now, by the way.

3211
02:21:12.30 --> 02:21:13.58
He's out there getting after it.

3212
02:21:13.58 --> 02:21:18.42
There's already blood on the Raptor Camo at this time.

3213
02:21:18.42 --> 02:21:21.86
So, so that's freaking legit.

3214
02:21:23.26 --> 02:21:26.98
But not an easy thing to get done, man.

3215
02:21:26.98 --> 02:21:28.18
Holy crap.

3216
02:21:28.18 --> 02:21:29.30
No, man.

3217
02:21:29.30 --> 02:21:33.66
It was, I'd never seen roller printing before.

3218
02:21:33.66 --> 02:21:36.06
We didn't know if the wool would hold, you know,

3219
02:21:36.06 --> 02:21:38.74
like this, this stealth wool that we gleaned

3220
02:21:38.74 --> 02:21:42.34
from the special, special forces, we, we tweaked it,

3221
02:21:42.34 --> 02:21:46.26
you know, so we, we took what they were using for this glove

3222
02:21:46.26 --> 02:21:49.82
and we tweaked it for our liking with the,

3223
02:21:49.82 --> 02:21:52.14
with the blend that we wanted.

3224
02:21:52.14 --> 02:21:55.90
And then it's like scorched under a thousand degree heat

3225
02:21:55.90 --> 02:21:58.06
in it, in it, in it, in it scorches the outside

3226
02:21:58.06 --> 02:22:00.06
and gives it almost a shell, a little bit of a shell

3227
02:22:00.06 --> 02:22:01.26
type of feel.

3228
02:22:01.26 --> 02:22:03.54
And we're like, cool, all that's cool.

3229
02:22:03.54 --> 02:22:05.22
Can we print it?

3230
02:22:05.22 --> 02:22:06.86
You know, like we don't have no idea,

3231
02:22:06.86 --> 02:22:11.22
but you have to like run a sizable amount of the product,

3232
02:22:11.22 --> 02:22:14.54
which is not cheap at 50 bucks a yard, right?

3233
02:22:14.54 --> 02:22:17.66
You got to run us a bunch of it to see if you can print it.

3234
02:22:17.66 --> 02:22:21.14
So you're taking all these little risks, you know,

3235
02:22:21.14 --> 02:22:25.82
and it really is, is what it's taking to do all this is,

3236
02:22:25.82 --> 02:22:27.18
you're just taking risks.

3237
02:22:27.18 --> 02:22:28.58
What's the worst that can happen?

3238
02:22:28.58 --> 02:22:29.58
You lose some money.

3239
02:22:30.54 --> 02:22:31.82
Okay.

3240
02:22:31.82 --> 02:22:34.94
What's more important, losing money

3241
02:22:34.94 --> 02:22:36.98
or rebuilding this thing.

3242
02:22:36.98 --> 02:22:38.86
So we take the risks, right?

3243
02:22:38.86 --> 02:22:43.18
But seeing for the first time that like stealth will go

3244
02:22:43.18 --> 02:22:46.58
through that roller printer and come off the other side.

3245
02:22:46.58 --> 02:22:50.78
I was like, bro, I mean, I had no words.

3246
02:22:50.78 --> 02:22:53.86
Like I looked at Kip, he looked at me, you know,

3247
02:22:53.86 --> 02:22:55.54
he's like, are you kidding me, man?

3248
02:22:55.54 --> 02:22:56.46
Look at this shit.

3249
02:22:56.46 --> 02:22:58.98
I'm like, yeah, bro, like this is it.

3250
02:22:58.98 --> 02:23:02.86
It was at that point, I was a believer, you know,

3251
02:23:02.86 --> 02:23:06.18
I was a believer, like we actually can build

3252
02:23:06.18 --> 02:23:11.18
a innovative, high performing hunt line in America.

3253
02:23:12.46 --> 02:23:14.54
Cause there's some, there's some good technical stuff

3254
02:23:14.54 --> 02:23:16.14
out there, you know, there is.

3255
02:23:16.14 --> 02:23:18.50
And we still got it.

3256
02:23:18.50 --> 02:23:21.02
I guess that's what I would say, like we still got it.

3257
02:23:21.94 --> 02:23:25.90
And it launched what's today, the 20, 26,

3258
02:23:25.90 --> 02:23:27.82
26 public, so it launched for pre-order,

3259
02:23:27.82 --> 02:23:30.26
for pre-order because today.

3260
02:23:30.26 --> 02:23:31.10
Yeah.

3261
02:23:31.10 --> 02:23:33.94
It's pre-order now because what we made is sold.

3262
02:23:33.94 --> 02:23:36.98
Well, yeah, it's because we're making the stuff right now.

3263
02:23:36.98 --> 02:23:38.82
And we're still weaving some of the textiles

3264
02:23:38.82 --> 02:23:40.10
for some of the line.

3265
02:23:40.10 --> 02:23:42.90
And, you know, we're literally making it.

3266
02:23:42.90 --> 02:23:44.82
It's not like all pre-made, it didn't come over

3267
02:23:44.82 --> 02:23:46.42
in a freaking container.

3268
02:23:46.42 --> 02:23:48.14
And we didn't just bring it into a warehouse

3269
02:23:48.14 --> 02:23:49.82
and ship it out, we're freaking making the shit.

3270
02:23:49.82 --> 02:23:53.74
So if people want it and they want to, you know,

3271
02:23:53.74 --> 02:23:57.02
help and wear something on American land

3272
02:23:57.02 --> 02:23:59.74
that's American made, put the pre-order in.

3273
02:23:59.74 --> 02:24:02.78
Yeah, well, the other thing that we were talking about

3274
02:24:02.78 --> 02:24:07.06
earlier you were explaining to me is we have limited

3275
02:24:07.06 --> 02:24:09.86
amount of fabric, we have limited amount of time,

3276
02:24:09.86 --> 02:24:11.54
we have limited amount of capacity

3277
02:24:11.54 --> 02:24:12.82
to actually make this stuff.

3278
02:24:12.82 --> 02:24:17.82
So if you are out there and you need the woodland cami

3279
02:24:20.50 --> 02:24:24.02
instead of the highland cami, we need to know that now.

3280
02:24:24.02 --> 02:24:25.18
So we can make it for you.

3281
02:24:25.18 --> 02:24:30.18
And if you need a size whatever XL and your wife needs

3282
02:24:30.42 --> 02:24:32.66
a size medium, we need to know that

3283
02:24:32.66 --> 02:24:34.34
so we can make the right thing.

3284
02:24:34.34 --> 02:24:38.10
So that's why the pre-order is important on this stuff

3285
02:24:38.10 --> 02:24:39.46
so we can make the right amount of stuff

3286
02:24:39.46 --> 02:24:40.66
and get it out to y'all.

3287
02:24:43.66 --> 02:24:44.50
What else, man?

3288
02:24:45.86 --> 02:24:46.70
I mean, I know there's a ton of,

3289
02:24:46.70 --> 02:24:48.70
that's kind of like the broad strokes of the last year.

3290
02:24:48.70 --> 02:24:49.54
What about camp this year?

3291
02:24:49.54 --> 02:24:50.38
How was camp?

3292
02:24:50.38 --> 02:24:51.22
How was camp?

3293
02:24:51.22 --> 02:24:52.06
Back with Charles, you've been quiet.

3294
02:24:52.06 --> 02:24:52.90
How's camp?

3295
02:24:52.90 --> 02:24:53.74
Good camp.

3296
02:24:53.74 --> 02:24:54.58
Yeah?

3297
02:24:54.58 --> 02:24:56.46
More mellow, a lot more people, but more mellow.

3298
02:24:56.46 --> 02:24:57.70
Yeah, you've been chill, man.

3299
02:24:57.70 --> 02:24:59.62
I've been watching you out of the corner of my,

3300
02:24:59.62 --> 02:25:01.18
this has been a good conversation.

3301
02:25:01.18 --> 02:25:03.34
Yeah, over here just cruising.

3302
02:25:03.34 --> 02:25:04.50
Yep, that's true.

3303
02:25:04.50 --> 02:25:06.10
Echo and I are matching right now.

3304
02:25:06.10 --> 02:25:08.70
We're wearing that spring hoodie.

3305
02:25:08.70 --> 02:25:09.94
New favorite, by the way.

3306
02:25:09.94 --> 02:25:10.78
Yeah, that's nice.

3307
02:25:10.78 --> 02:25:11.62
It's a good look.

3308
02:25:11.62 --> 02:25:13.50
Jiu-Jitsu is getting more popular.

3309
02:25:13.50 --> 02:25:15.30
Dude, it's exploding.

3310
02:25:15.30 --> 02:25:17.02
People love Jiu-Jitsu.

3311
02:25:18.58 --> 02:25:19.62
Are you concerned?

3312
02:25:19.62 --> 02:25:23.66
So we got Gal Val versus Gordon Ryan coming up.

3313
02:25:23.66 --> 02:25:24.50
Yeah.

3314
02:25:26.38 --> 02:25:27.34
Here's my concern.

3315
02:25:27.34 --> 02:25:29.78
It's gonna be hype, right?

3316
02:25:29.78 --> 02:25:31.54
It's gonna be hype.

3317
02:25:31.54 --> 02:25:33.50
One of my concerns, like they're saying

3318
02:25:33.50 --> 02:25:35.18
there's gonna be 20,000 people live.

3319
02:25:35.18 --> 02:25:36.46
Are you going to the ADC?

3320
02:25:36.46 --> 02:25:37.30
It doesn't look like it,

3321
02:25:37.30 --> 02:25:39.74
because I'll be in the mountains hunting.

3322
02:25:39.74 --> 02:25:40.98
Oh, in Raptor Campbell.

3323
02:25:40.98 --> 02:25:42.18
Yes, in Raptor Campbell.

3324
02:25:44.34 --> 02:25:45.82
And it's on Sunday too.

3325
02:25:45.82 --> 02:25:47.66
So I actually, I can confirm right now,

3326
02:25:47.66 --> 02:25:49.86
I will not be there, unfortunately.

3327
02:25:49.86 --> 02:25:52.98
So here's my concern about this.

3328
02:25:56.50 --> 02:25:58.62
Jiu-Jitsu, in that match,

3329
02:25:58.62 --> 02:26:02.02
well, Jiu-Jitsu 4 can be boring to watch

3330
02:26:02.02 --> 02:26:03.14
in certain situations.

3331
02:26:03.14 --> 02:26:06.30
There are, there's a, what percentage chance

3332
02:26:06.30 --> 02:26:09.06
that this is a boring match, Echo Charles?

3333
02:26:09.06 --> 02:26:10.30
I don't think it'll be boring.

3334
02:26:10.30 --> 02:26:11.62
Okay, so you don't think,

3335
02:26:11.62 --> 02:26:13.34
you think it's a 100% exciting match?

3336
02:26:13.34 --> 02:26:14.98
I think the chance of it being exciting

3337
02:26:14.98 --> 02:26:17.46
is like 85 to 90%.

3338
02:26:17.46 --> 02:26:19.58
Okay, so okay, I'm gonna reverse.

3339
02:26:19.58 --> 02:26:21.38
You think it's, I think it's,

3340
02:26:21.38 --> 02:26:23.54
I think it's gonna be lackluster.

3341
02:26:23.54 --> 02:26:26.38
I think Andre's gonna play anti-Jiu-Jitsu

3342
02:26:26.38 --> 02:26:29.78
and try to hit like when the points start.

3343
02:26:29.78 --> 02:26:31.82
A double leg with three minutes left.

3344
02:26:31.82 --> 02:26:33.58
Yes, that's what I think is gonna happen.

3345
02:26:33.58 --> 02:26:35.82
Okay, is that the, what's the rule set, ADCC?

3346
02:26:35.82 --> 02:26:36.66
It's 20 minutes.

3347
02:26:36.66 --> 02:26:38.10
So it's a super fight in ADCC.

3348
02:26:38.10 --> 02:26:39.94
10 minutes, no points.

3349
02:26:39.94 --> 02:26:40.78
Right.

3350
02:26:40.78 --> 02:26:42.82
10 minutes, points.

3351
02:26:42.82 --> 02:26:45.06
10 minute overtime, 10 minute overtime.

3352
02:26:45.06 --> 02:26:48.22
So it's, it could be a total of 40 minutes.

3353
02:26:48.22 --> 02:26:51.38
And there's, so that's the rule set, I'm pretty sure.

3354
02:26:51.38 --> 02:26:52.22
Yeah.

3355
02:26:53.26 --> 02:26:55.30
I think if Gordon doesn't,

3356
02:26:56.78 --> 02:26:59.18
you know how he calls out his submissions or whatever.

3357
02:26:59.18 --> 02:27:01.78
If he just goes in there to win,

3358
02:27:01.78 --> 02:27:02.62
I think it could be exciting.

3359
02:27:02.62 --> 02:27:03.74
Oh, he like, 100% is gonna do that.

3360
02:27:03.74 --> 02:27:04.98
Not like I'm gonna do this to Aaron Elville.

3361
02:27:04.98 --> 02:27:05.82
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3362
02:27:05.82 --> 02:27:06.66
He's not gonna do that.

3363
02:27:06.66 --> 02:27:09.06
Here's the thing, man, it is freaking hard

3364
02:27:09.06 --> 02:27:13.78
to do Jiu-Jitsu against someone that is avoiding Jiu-Jitsu.

3365
02:27:13.78 --> 02:27:14.62
And,

3366
02:27:14.62 --> 02:27:18.26
you know, that can be really hard.

3367
02:27:20.62 --> 02:27:24.54
And if that's the game that Andre plays,

3368
02:27:24.54 --> 02:27:25.82
then that might be boring.

3369
02:27:25.82 --> 02:27:28.34
Hey, if Andre goes at him, right on.

3370
02:27:28.34 --> 02:27:31.14
We're gonna have an awesome, an awesome match.

3371
02:27:32.34 --> 02:27:35.10
But that could happen.

3372
02:27:35.10 --> 02:27:38.66
We could, I'm worried that might be not as exciting

3373
02:27:38.66 --> 02:27:40.42
as we want it to be.

3374
02:27:40.42 --> 02:27:43.06
And I started talking yesterday, who was I talking to?

3375
02:27:43.06 --> 02:27:44.98
I was talking to some people at camp.

3376
02:27:44.98 --> 02:27:47.50
And I was like, some kind of a hybrid.

3377
02:27:47.50 --> 02:27:51.14
Like in wrestling, you can get called for stalling.

3378
02:27:51.14 --> 02:27:54.14
And here's the problem with that.

3379
02:27:54.14 --> 02:27:55.94
Calling people for stalling in Jiu-Jitsu

3380
02:27:55.94 --> 02:27:58.14
goes against one of the principles of Jiu-Jitsu,

3381
02:27:58.14 --> 02:28:00.66
which is conservation of energy, right?

3382
02:28:00.66 --> 02:28:03.14
So my goal, if I'm going against a big wrestler,

3383
02:28:03.14 --> 02:28:08.14
my actual goal is to not work and make them work and stall.

3384
02:28:08.74 --> 02:28:09.86
That's my goal.

3385
02:28:09.86 --> 02:28:12.54
That's how Jiu-Jitsu wins in that situation.

3386
02:28:12.54 --> 02:28:17.14
So to create a rule where you can't do that,

3387
02:28:17.14 --> 02:28:19.62
you can't stall, which is technically what you're doing,

3388
02:28:19.62 --> 02:28:20.46
right? You're stalling.

3389
02:28:20.46 --> 02:28:22.30
You're holding someone in your guard and you're stalling.

3390
02:28:22.30 --> 02:28:24.06
You're making them trying to pass, you're stalling.

3391
02:28:24.06 --> 02:28:25.42
You're not attacking, you're not trying to sweep them.

3392
02:28:25.42 --> 02:28:26.18
You're not, you're stalling.

3393
02:28:26.18 --> 02:28:27.26
That's stalling.

3394
02:28:27.26 --> 02:28:29.02
So there's a problem with that rule

3395
02:28:29.02 --> 02:28:31.38
because it goes against one of the principles of Jiu-Jitsu,

3396
02:28:31.38 --> 02:28:32.74
which kind of sucks.

3397
02:28:32.74 --> 02:28:37.74
Yeah. And if you look at like the match with Galvo,

3398
02:28:38.10 --> 02:28:41.62
and I think it was Huron or Hena Gracie

3399
02:28:41.62 --> 02:28:46.62
where he was showing how to defend someone

3400
02:28:47.18 --> 02:28:48.50
who was a world champion.

3401
02:28:48.50 --> 02:28:49.42
Remember this match?

3402
02:28:49.42 --> 02:28:50.26
Metamoros.

3403
02:28:50.26 --> 02:28:51.58
Metamoros, there you go.

3404
02:28:51.58 --> 02:28:52.50
Who is showing what?

3405
02:28:52.50 --> 02:28:55.06
So basically, was it Hena or Huron?

3406
02:28:55.06 --> 02:28:55.90
Hena Gracie.

3407
02:28:55.90 --> 02:28:56.86
Hena Gracie.

3408
02:28:56.86 --> 02:28:58.50
And he fought Galvo.

3409
02:28:58.50 --> 02:28:59.74
And Huron doesn't compete.

3410
02:28:59.74 --> 02:29:02.42
And Galvo was a world champion at this point.

3411
02:29:02.42 --> 02:29:07.42
And Galvo was trying to submit him for 10, 20 minutes.

3412
02:29:08.02 --> 02:29:08.86
Yeah, 20.

3413
02:29:08.86 --> 02:29:10.10
Doesn't submit him.

3414
02:29:10.10 --> 02:29:11.82
Why? Well, he played defense.

3415
02:29:12.86 --> 02:29:15.74
He survived, he played defense and good to go.

3416
02:29:15.74 --> 02:29:17.22
It wasn't a draw.

3417
02:29:17.22 --> 02:29:18.42
Because it was a submission only fight.

3418
02:29:18.42 --> 02:29:19.66
No, it wasn't a no-me.

3419
02:29:19.66 --> 02:29:20.50
You know what I mean?

3420
02:29:20.50 --> 02:29:24.78
So I think Andre knows both sides of that.

3421
02:29:24.78 --> 02:29:27.30
So I hope he engages.

3422
02:29:27.30 --> 02:29:30.98
I mean, after the whole situation with Gordon Slapping

3423
02:29:30.98 --> 02:29:35.06
and everything, I'd wanna prove something.

3424
02:29:35.06 --> 02:29:35.90
You know what I mean?

3425
02:29:35.90 --> 02:29:37.86
Like when they had that little exchange

3426
02:29:37.86 --> 02:29:42.86
that's that, yeah, I mean, I hope it's fireworks.

3427
02:29:43.26 --> 02:29:44.86
You know, I mean, yeah.

3428
02:29:44.86 --> 02:29:46.58
And I guess the reason I brought that up is cause, you know,

3429
02:29:46.58 --> 02:29:47.50
we're here at Jiu-Jitsu Camp.

3430
02:29:47.50 --> 02:29:50.02
So Jiu-Jitsu is on the mind, but also like just talking

3431
02:29:50.02 --> 02:29:51.58
about the popularity of Jiu-Jitsu

3432
02:29:51.58 --> 02:29:54.74
and how so many more people are engaged.

3433
02:29:54.74 --> 02:29:55.98
The biggest camp we've ever had, right?

3434
02:29:55.98 --> 02:29:57.58
Biggest camp we've ever had.

3435
02:29:57.58 --> 02:30:00.38
And because of that explosion, man,

3436
02:30:00.38 --> 02:30:01.98
adding two new looms to the factory,

3437
02:30:01.98 --> 02:30:03.62
they showed up on Friday.

3438
02:30:03.62 --> 02:30:04.98
We're gonna get those things installed

3439
02:30:04.98 --> 02:30:08.22
and start ripping out more geese and obviously

3440
02:30:08.22 --> 02:30:10.90
new grappling shorts, which you're gonna try.

3441
02:30:10.90 --> 02:30:12.26
Yeah, yeah.

3442
02:30:12.26 --> 02:30:13.26
Might have to make some tweaks.

3443
02:30:13.26 --> 02:30:14.26
They're freaking nice though.

3444
02:30:14.26 --> 02:30:15.42
That material is perfect.

3445
02:30:15.42 --> 02:30:16.26
Yeah.

3446
02:30:16.26 --> 02:30:18.38
It's a weird material cause you feel like

3447
02:30:18.38 --> 02:30:19.38
it's not even on you.

3448
02:30:19.38 --> 02:30:22.26
Like you kind of feel like you're freaking in Spartacus

3449
02:30:22.26 --> 02:30:23.46
over there grappling naked.

3450
02:30:23.46 --> 02:30:24.66
You know what I'm saying?

3451
02:30:24.66 --> 02:30:26.98
It's so like light and flexible.

3452
02:30:26.98 --> 02:30:27.90
I'm gonna hold you back, man.

3453
02:30:27.90 --> 02:30:29.86
It's freaking legit.

3454
02:30:29.86 --> 02:30:33.58
Did you, yes or no, get tears in your eyes

3455
02:30:33.58 --> 02:30:36.54
when I promoted my daughter to blue belt?

3456
02:30:36.54 --> 02:30:37.38
I did.

3457
02:30:37.38 --> 02:30:38.22
I did.

3458
02:30:38.22 --> 02:30:40.06
I get it.

3459
02:30:40.06 --> 02:30:41.74
Amanda, my wife says to me,

3460
02:30:41.74 --> 02:30:45.14
the only time you cry is belts and babies.

3461
02:30:45.14 --> 02:30:46.50
You don't cry when people die.

3462
02:30:46.50 --> 02:30:47.34
I don't.

3463
02:30:47.34 --> 02:30:48.18
I don't cry at death.

3464
02:30:48.18 --> 02:30:50.02
It's belts and babies.

3465
02:30:51.06 --> 02:30:54.38
I know the, I don't know what it is about babies.

3466
02:30:54.38 --> 02:30:57.34
Honestly, if there's a baby around crying,

3467
02:30:57.34 --> 02:31:00.34
I sweat immediately cause you know,

3468
02:31:00.34 --> 02:31:02.10
having babies and getting up in the middle of the night,

3469
02:31:02.10 --> 02:31:06.74
you kind of get into this difficult sleeping situation.

3470
02:31:06.74 --> 02:31:09.10
So I, I'll sweat when there's a baby crying

3471
02:31:09.10 --> 02:31:10.34
near me immediately.

3472
02:31:11.86 --> 02:31:14.82
But belts, knowing the work it goes

3473
02:31:14.82 --> 02:31:17.94
and the relationship and the commitment,

3474
02:31:17.94 --> 02:31:21.38
seeing you promote Rana was, was pretty moving.

3475
02:31:21.38 --> 02:31:25.94
And I kind of was trying to dry out my eyes a little bit.

3476
02:31:25.94 --> 02:31:28.42
And I had one single,

3477
02:31:28.42 --> 02:31:29.74
why do I have to wipe?

3478
02:31:29.74 --> 02:31:31.18
It might have been a tear or two,

3479
02:31:31.18 --> 02:31:34.82
but I had a white, but your eyes were a little wet there.

3480
02:31:34.82 --> 02:31:36.50
Yeah, there was a little dusty in there.

3481
02:31:36.50 --> 02:31:37.98
Yeah, why is there a little dusty?

3482
02:31:37.98 --> 02:31:39.38
Echo Charles, yay or nay?

3483
02:31:39.38 --> 02:31:40.22
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3484
02:31:40.22 --> 02:31:41.06
Oh, you did?

3485
02:31:41.06 --> 02:31:41.90
It was very dusty in there.

3486
02:31:41.90 --> 02:31:42.74
Yeah.

3487
02:31:42.74 --> 02:31:44.46
But, but I did do it comparatively speaking,

3488
02:31:44.46 --> 02:31:45.30
I did a good job.

3489
02:31:45.30 --> 02:31:46.62
Yeah, you did.

3490
02:31:46.62 --> 02:31:48.50
Here's the, here's the thing I thought about later.

3491
02:31:48.50 --> 02:31:50.78
And it, okay.

3492
02:31:50.78 --> 02:31:52.86
Okay, so she got her blue belt.

3493
02:31:52.86 --> 02:31:55.78
Technically getting your blue belt is not a big deal.

3494
02:31:55.78 --> 02:31:57.34
I mean, honestly, right?

3495
02:31:57.34 --> 02:31:59.98
Standard getting your blue belt is not a big deal.

3496
02:31:59.98 --> 02:32:02.22
And I didn't think about this till after,

3497
02:32:03.46 --> 02:32:05.62
because getting your blue belts,

3498
02:32:05.62 --> 02:32:07.62
listen, it's great you got your blue belt,

3499
02:32:07.62 --> 02:32:10.34
but no one's hyped in a big way

3500
02:32:10.34 --> 02:32:12.66
because you got your blue belt, right?

3501
02:32:12.66 --> 02:32:16.46
But what, what it was, and the, I didn't realize this

3502
02:32:16.46 --> 02:32:20.86
because I'm in it, is I, the journey that she's had

3503
02:32:20.86 --> 02:32:25.78
to get her blue belt has been long and hard,

3504
02:32:25.78 --> 02:32:28.50
and really long and hard.

3505
02:32:28.50 --> 02:32:31.14
And, and, and it's been long and hard

3506
02:32:31.14 --> 02:32:33.58
because of me as a dad.

3507
02:32:33.58 --> 02:32:37.06
And so when she's, you know, when they were little kids,

3508
02:32:37.06 --> 02:32:40.06
you heard me saying this in the, in the little speech I gave,

3509
02:32:40.06 --> 02:32:44.78
I had my kids training Jiu Jitsu seven days a week,

3510
02:32:44.78 --> 02:32:47.62
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,

3511
02:32:47.62 --> 02:32:48.90
Saturday and Sunday.

3512
02:32:48.90 --> 02:32:51.98
And on a couple of the three of those days,

3513
02:32:51.98 --> 02:32:55.34
no, four of those days, they did striking and Jiu Jitsu.

3514
02:32:55.34 --> 02:32:59.34
And they're like ages five, seven and nine.

3515
02:33:00.58 --> 02:33:02.94
We would go to the gym on Saturday

3516
02:33:02.94 --> 02:33:05.06
at we'd leave at seven 30 in the morning.

3517
02:33:05.06 --> 02:33:07.58
I'd get home from the gym at two o'clock in the afternoon.

3518
02:33:07.58 --> 02:33:09.06
They'd be with me the whole time.

3519
02:33:09.06 --> 02:33:11.54
They'd take class, they'd take two classes of Jiu Jitsu

3520
02:33:11.54 --> 02:33:13.70
and a striking class every day of the week.

3521
02:33:13.70 --> 02:33:16.66
They're in there, they'd take both classes.

3522
02:33:16.66 --> 02:33:18.70
I made them compete.

3523
02:33:19.70 --> 02:33:20.62
Let me rephrase that.

3524
02:33:20.62 --> 02:33:22.30
I mean, and by the way, anyone that's listening

3525
02:33:22.30 --> 02:33:24.34
is like, hell yeah, no, this is wrong.

3526
02:33:24.34 --> 02:33:25.70
It wasn't good.

3527
02:33:25.70 --> 02:33:27.26
I made them compete.

3528
02:33:27.26 --> 02:33:31.06
When I made them compete, this is my first three kids.

3529
02:33:31.06 --> 02:33:33.54
When I made them compete, I made them compete

3530
02:33:33.54 --> 02:33:37.76
up a weight class, up an age group, up a belt level.

3531
02:33:38.98 --> 02:33:42.46
And what happens when you go up a weight class,

3532
02:33:42.46 --> 02:33:45.86
up an age group and up a belt level, you get smashed.

3533
02:33:45.86 --> 02:33:47.26
And in my mind, I'm thinking,

3534
02:33:47.26 --> 02:33:49.58
hey, I'm a great dad, I'm gonna make them tougher.

3535
02:33:49.58 --> 02:33:51.54
But all it did was make Jiu Jitsu suck

3536
02:33:51.54 --> 02:33:54.82
because you go to a tournament, you compete, you lose.

3537
02:33:54.82 --> 02:33:56.86
And I just thought I'm making them tougher and I'm not.

3538
02:33:56.86 --> 02:33:58.78
I'm actually making Jiu Jitsu suck for them,

3539
02:33:58.78 --> 02:34:01.62
making it a bad experience.

3540
02:34:01.62 --> 02:34:06.62
And eventually, they got old enough where it was like,

3541
02:34:07.70 --> 02:34:09.54
I don't wanna do this anymore.

3542
02:34:09.54 --> 02:34:12.26
And my two daughters, at a certain age,

3543
02:34:12.26 --> 02:34:14.42
and they were the oldest of the three,

3544
02:34:14.42 --> 02:34:16.94
and I have four now, but they were the oldest of three.

3545
02:34:16.94 --> 02:34:20.26
They protested to a point where it's like,

3546
02:34:20.26 --> 02:34:24.90
my wife said, hey, you can't do this to these girls anymore.

3547
02:34:24.90 --> 02:34:29.90
So, let's say we settled it down, didn't train as much.

3548
02:34:30.38 --> 02:34:32.30
But, and then luckily,

3549
02:34:34.30 --> 02:34:36.58
Rana, when she got to high school,

3550
02:34:39.22 --> 02:34:41.10
I persuaded her to wrestle.

3551
02:34:42.06 --> 02:34:43.38
I persuaded her to wrestle.

3552
02:34:43.38 --> 02:34:44.34
And to be quite honest with you,

3553
02:34:44.34 --> 02:34:47.38
I persuaded her to wrestle with money.

3554
02:34:47.38 --> 02:34:50.46
I was like, I will pay you to wrestle.

3555
02:34:50.46 --> 02:34:52.66
I'll pay you to go and wrestle.

3556
02:34:52.66 --> 02:34:54.50
And so she did it.

3557
02:34:54.50 --> 02:34:56.10
And it took a little while

3558
02:34:56.10 --> 02:34:58.50
before she wasn't doing it for the money anymore.

3559
02:34:59.62 --> 02:35:01.54
She was doing it, she was into it.

3560
02:35:01.54 --> 02:35:05.98
But again, this is after going through a lot of stress

3561
02:35:05.98 --> 02:35:07.42
and tournaments as a little kid

3562
02:35:07.42 --> 02:35:10.98
and Jiu Jitsu tournaments and all that.

3563
02:35:10.98 --> 02:35:12.34
And now she's wrestling.

3564
02:35:12.34 --> 02:35:14.70
She wrestled all through high school.

3565
02:35:14.70 --> 02:35:17.22
Her first year, she's the only girl in the wrestling team.

3566
02:35:17.22 --> 02:35:18.34
She was in wrestling room.

3567
02:35:18.34 --> 02:35:21.26
A sweaty, gross wrestling room.

3568
02:35:21.26 --> 02:35:22.18
Filled with ringworm.

3569
02:35:22.18 --> 02:35:24.90
And filled with ringworm and filled with, you know,

3570
02:35:24.90 --> 02:35:29.90
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 year old boys.

3571
02:35:31.90 --> 02:35:33.18
That's what she's in there with.

3572
02:35:33.18 --> 02:35:34.98
And she stuck it out.

3573
02:35:34.98 --> 02:35:38.82
And she ended up, you know, going through that program

3574
02:35:38.82 --> 02:35:41.74
and eventually making it to state in California,

3575
02:35:41.74 --> 02:35:42.78
which is a huge deal.

3576
02:35:42.78 --> 02:35:46.66
And first person from her school

3577
02:35:46.66 --> 02:35:48.98
that's made it to state in like 35 years

3578
02:35:48.98 --> 02:35:49.82
or something like this.

3579
02:35:49.82 --> 02:35:51.54
So, and it was her.

3580
02:35:51.54 --> 02:35:56.54
Like the program, the program just didn't have the wherewithal

3581
02:35:56.66 --> 02:35:58.26
to get a student to do that.

3582
02:35:58.26 --> 02:35:59.46
She did it, you know?

3583
02:36:01.78 --> 02:36:04.54
And then finally she goes to college.

3584
02:36:04.54 --> 02:36:06.18
And while she's at college,

3585
02:36:06.18 --> 02:36:09.34
she decides she's gonna try that as Jiu Jitsu again.

3586
02:36:09.34 --> 02:36:10.82
Wow.

3587
02:36:10.82 --> 02:36:12.42
Which is freaking awesome.

3588
02:36:12.42 --> 02:36:16.94
And you know what, after about a week,

3589
02:36:16.94 --> 02:36:19.50
she called me, she's crying.

3590
02:36:19.50 --> 02:36:22.26
She cried over her first week of Jiu Jitsu.

3591
02:36:22.26 --> 02:36:24.12
No one wants to train with me.

3592
02:36:24.12 --> 02:36:26.14
I don't think anyone wants to train with a girl.

3593
02:36:26.14 --> 02:36:27.42
No one wants to train with me.

3594
02:36:27.42 --> 02:36:29.94
And you know, it's stress.

3595
02:36:29.94 --> 02:36:31.46
There's college and all this other stuff going on.

3596
02:36:31.46 --> 02:36:33.06
There's a little morsel of her life.

3597
02:36:33.06 --> 02:36:34.34
And there's a lot of stuff going on.

3598
02:36:34.34 --> 02:36:36.22
And this is where it comes out.

3599
02:36:36.22 --> 02:36:37.86
And I'm like, hey, don't worry.

3600
02:36:37.86 --> 02:36:38.86
Everything's gonna be cool.

3601
02:36:38.86 --> 02:36:40.78
You know, you're gonna get to know people.

3602
02:36:40.78 --> 02:36:41.98
It's fine.

3603
02:36:41.98 --> 02:36:43.26
Just keep going.

3604
02:36:43.26 --> 02:36:44.14
Please keep going.

3605
02:36:44.14 --> 02:36:46.18
And sure, she's kept going.

3606
02:36:47.18 --> 02:36:49.34
Paragon, slow.

3607
02:36:49.34 --> 02:36:50.38
And that's where she trains.

3608
02:36:50.38 --> 02:36:51.94
And great, I ended up going up there

3609
02:36:51.94 --> 02:36:53.42
teaching a little bit up there.

3610
02:36:53.42 --> 02:36:54.50
But it's just a great academy.

3611
02:36:54.50 --> 02:36:58.74
She ended up making great friends and working her ass off.

3612
02:36:59.84 --> 02:37:02.82
And this is, you know, this is what she's 21 now.

3613
02:37:02.82 --> 02:37:06.58
So we're talking about like a 16 year journey, right?

3614
02:37:06.58 --> 02:37:08.82
This is the longest, this is most of her life,

3615
02:37:08.82 --> 02:37:10.34
you know what I'm saying?

3616
02:37:10.34 --> 02:37:12.68
And so then finally, so when she comes back,

3617
02:37:12.68 --> 02:37:15.38
so now she's been training for two years up there.

3618
02:37:15.38 --> 02:37:20.38
Hard, hard, two days, you know, stuff like this.

3619
02:37:20.50 --> 02:37:25.50
And so she comes back down to San Diego this summer

3620
02:37:25.74 --> 02:37:28.30
and she's teaching, she's helping teach kids classes,

3621
02:37:28.30 --> 02:37:29.86
but she's training all the time, training.

3622
02:37:29.86 --> 02:37:34.62
And immediately my black belts are like, dude,

3623
02:37:35.74 --> 02:37:36.98
you need to get your belt.

3624
02:37:36.98 --> 02:37:37.82
I rolled with it.

3625
02:37:37.82 --> 02:37:38.66
You rolled with it.

3626
02:37:38.66 --> 02:37:39.50
Yeah, you need to get your belt.

3627
02:37:39.50 --> 02:37:41.06
I rolled another color belt.

3628
02:37:41.06 --> 02:37:43.50
And I kind of felt like, well, you know,

3629
02:37:43.50 --> 02:37:45.78
she's up at Paragon now.

3630
02:37:45.78 --> 02:37:49.66
And that's like, you know, her teachers and her instructors.

3631
02:37:49.66 --> 02:37:52.18
And so I just said, hey guys, you know, she's up at Paragon.

3632
02:37:52.18 --> 02:37:53.90
She'll get, you know, hopefully she gets promoted

3633
02:37:53.90 --> 02:37:54.74
when she gets back up there.

3634
02:37:54.74 --> 02:37:57.06
And then like, she's tapping out a bunch of people

3635
02:37:57.06 --> 02:37:58.18
in the academy.

3636
02:37:58.18 --> 02:38:01.34
And my black belts, once again, you know,

3637
02:38:01.34 --> 02:38:03.18
Coach Adams like, dude, come on.

3638
02:38:04.10 --> 02:38:07.18
Coach Bryan's like, dude, you're you kidding me?

3639
02:38:07.18 --> 02:38:08.14
Then I rolled with her.

3640
02:38:08.14 --> 02:38:11.74
And I was like, oh, okay, this is not fair.

3641
02:38:11.74 --> 02:38:14.90
And so finally what I did reached out to her professors

3642
02:38:14.90 --> 02:38:19.14
up there and I sent him a text or a message on Instagram,

3643
02:38:19.14 --> 02:38:21.22
gave my phone number and said, hey, I need to talk to you.

3644
02:38:21.22 --> 02:38:23.10
It's Jocko, can you give me a call?

3645
02:38:23.10 --> 02:38:26.02
And the coach Chris, he called me up

3646
02:38:26.02 --> 02:38:27.82
and I knew the number from that area code.

3647
02:38:27.82 --> 02:38:30.30
And I answered, hey, hello, this is Jocko.

3648
02:38:30.30 --> 02:38:32.22
And he's like, hey, it's Chris.

3649
02:38:32.22 --> 02:38:34.82
He goes, I've been waiting for this call.

3650
02:38:34.82 --> 02:38:37.02
And I was like, that's like the best thing I've ever heard.

3651
02:38:37.02 --> 02:38:38.98
So, you know, he didn't want to promote her

3652
02:38:38.98 --> 02:38:40.14
because it's my daughter.

3653
02:38:40.14 --> 02:38:42.30
I didn't want to promote her because, you know,

3654
02:38:42.30 --> 02:38:43.26
she's been training with them.

3655
02:38:43.26 --> 02:38:45.14
They're putting a lot of work and effort into her.

3656
02:38:45.14 --> 02:38:47.02
But so that was cool.

3657
02:38:47.02 --> 02:38:49.74
So she did one more tournament as a white belt, double gold.

3658
02:38:49.74 --> 02:38:52.50
And then we came out here to camp and got the promotion.

3659
02:38:52.50 --> 02:38:55.70
So, so again, I realized afterwards I was like,

3660
02:38:55.70 --> 02:38:57.98
it's kind of weird that I kind of like echo,

3661
02:38:57.98 --> 02:39:01.30
you got your black belt at camp.

3662
02:39:01.30 --> 02:39:03.26
We all understand that's a big deal, right?

3663
02:39:03.26 --> 02:39:06.74
That's 15 years of training for you.

3664
02:39:06.74 --> 02:39:08.78
That's getting smashed, complete.

3665
02:39:08.78 --> 02:39:10.70
Like all those things, they ever kind of gets that.

3666
02:39:10.70 --> 02:39:12.46
But for Rano, it's like, oh, it's like,

3667
02:39:12.46 --> 02:39:13.30
oh, she got a blue belt.

3668
02:39:13.30 --> 02:39:14.14
That's pretty cool.

3669
02:39:14.14 --> 02:39:17.02
But I think it was like everybody kind of sensed it

3670
02:39:17.02 --> 02:39:18.34
because people were freaking hyped.

3671
02:39:18.34 --> 02:39:20.66
Oh yeah, man, that place was crazy.

3672
02:39:20.66 --> 02:39:22.86
Of course she was crying.

3673
02:39:22.86 --> 02:39:24.26
I mean, they were crying.

3674
02:39:24.26 --> 02:39:25.42
You weren't crying.

3675
02:39:25.42 --> 02:39:26.42
They were crying.

3676
02:39:26.42 --> 02:39:27.26
Yeah.

3677
02:39:27.26 --> 02:39:30.02
That is awesome.

3678
02:39:30.02 --> 02:39:31.02
That's what it's about.

3679
02:39:31.02 --> 02:39:32.66
And yeah.

3680
02:39:32.66 --> 02:39:33.86
That's what it's all about.

3681
02:39:33.86 --> 02:39:34.70
That's what it's all about.

3682
02:39:34.70 --> 02:39:38.38
And Jiu-Jitsu is something that really brings people together.

3683
02:39:38.38 --> 02:39:41.86
And look, just like you can't impose things on your platoon

3684
02:39:41.86 --> 02:39:43.74
and you can't impose things on your workforce,

3685
02:39:43.74 --> 02:39:45.66
you can't impose things on your family.

3686
02:39:45.66 --> 02:39:49.22
But you can, if you're lucky, you can help them see the light.

3687
02:39:49.22 --> 02:39:51.26
You can help show them the path.

3688
02:39:51.26 --> 02:39:53.94
And when they find that path, when you show it to them

3689
02:39:53.94 --> 02:39:58.50
and it's there and they decide, you can lead a horse to water,

3690
02:39:58.50 --> 02:39:59.78
but you can't make a drink.

3691
02:39:59.78 --> 02:40:02.06
But when you get them there and they jump in,

3692
02:40:02.06 --> 02:40:05.90
man, that's one of the best things you could hope for.

3693
02:40:05.90 --> 02:40:09.38
So that was kind of a highlighted camp for me.

3694
02:40:09.38 --> 02:40:10.50
Dude, it was awesome.

3695
02:40:10.50 --> 02:40:13.02
Freaking awesome.

3696
02:40:13.02 --> 02:40:13.70
All right, what else?

3697
02:40:13.70 --> 02:40:14.42
Anything else, Pete?

3698
02:40:14.42 --> 02:40:15.94
Any closing thoughts?

3699
02:40:15.94 --> 02:40:16.42
No, man.

3700
02:40:16.42 --> 02:40:18.66
I appreciate you having me on.

3701
02:40:18.66 --> 02:40:21.98
Appreciate the, obviously, all the support over the years.

3702
02:40:21.98 --> 02:40:27.62
And of course, you telling the world about what we're doing

3703
02:40:27.62 --> 02:40:30.54
and why and keeping everybody's attention on it.

3704
02:40:30.54 --> 02:40:34.58
Because with all the attention grabbing going on these days,

3705
02:40:34.58 --> 02:40:38.42
anyone giving anything time these days is valuable.

3706
02:40:38.42 --> 02:40:40.74
So, man, I appreciate you.

3707
02:40:40.74 --> 02:40:42.02
Appreciate bringing me on again.

3708
02:40:42.02 --> 02:40:42.82
It's awesome.

3709
02:40:42.82 --> 02:40:45.90
Well, you'd be on all the time if you weren't freaking living

3710
02:40:45.90 --> 02:40:47.78
in Farmington, Maine, and I wasn't living in San Diego,

3711
02:40:47.78 --> 02:40:49.06
California.

3712
02:40:49.06 --> 02:40:52.66
And listen, look, what we're doing right now,

3713
02:40:52.66 --> 02:40:54.02
this is a campaign.

3714
02:40:54.02 --> 02:40:56.74
This is not one battle.

3715
02:40:56.74 --> 02:40:58.42
And we are going to lose.

3716
02:40:58.42 --> 02:41:00.94
We're going to miss things, and we have missed things.

3717
02:41:00.94 --> 02:41:03.34
And we're going to make mistakes.

3718
02:41:03.34 --> 02:41:06.90
But there are opportunities out there.

3719
02:41:06.90 --> 02:41:09.66
And what we are going to do is we're

3720
02:41:09.66 --> 02:41:11.14
going to make everything in America.

3721
02:41:11.14 --> 02:41:15.10
And I told this story yesterday when we were in the factory.

3722
02:41:15.10 --> 02:41:17.06
It's no compromise.

3723
02:41:17.06 --> 02:41:20.34
It's a no compromise situation.

3724
02:41:20.34 --> 02:41:23.26
And actually, I do remember the item.

3725
02:41:23.26 --> 02:41:31.14
We were making, what do you call the, we were making spats.

3726
02:41:31.14 --> 02:41:34.94
And we needed an elastic waistband.

3727
02:41:34.94 --> 02:41:38.22
And you and I were having a conversation,

3728
02:41:38.22 --> 02:41:40.58
and someone came up with a solution.

3729
02:41:40.58 --> 02:41:43.06
It was, you said, hey, John, I'm like, hey, man,

3730
02:41:43.06 --> 02:41:44.38
when are we getting these spats?

3731
02:41:44.38 --> 02:41:46.22
What's happening with that?

3732
02:41:46.22 --> 02:41:48.70
And you're like, well, it's pause.

3733
02:41:48.70 --> 02:41:51.58
The manufacturer is going to take four months before they

3734
02:41:51.58 --> 02:41:52.94
can tool this thing up, blah, blah, blah.

3735
02:41:52.94 --> 02:41:53.44
OK.

3736
02:41:53.44 --> 02:41:55.74
Or we got to get this machine and we'll be able to do ourselves.

3737
02:41:55.74 --> 02:41:55.94
OK.

3738
02:41:55.94 --> 02:41:57.86
I'm like, are there any solutions?

3739
02:41:57.86 --> 02:41:58.98
Finally, we get a solution.

3740
02:41:58.98 --> 02:42:01.50
The solution is, hey, there's an overseas company that

3741
02:42:01.50 --> 02:42:03.58
can have this stuff to us in three weeks.

3742
02:42:03.58 --> 02:42:05.66
Airship, boom, done.

3743
02:42:05.66 --> 02:42:10.70
And you were just like, no compromise.

3744
02:42:10.70 --> 02:42:13.38
And I was like, of course, no compromise.

3745
02:42:13.38 --> 02:42:17.42
And that attitude is hard.

3746
02:42:17.42 --> 02:42:18.42
It's hard to hold the line.

3747
02:42:18.42 --> 02:42:22.90
And listen, do you compromise in life?

3748
02:42:22.90 --> 02:42:26.86
When your spouse wants something and you want something else

3749
02:42:26.86 --> 02:42:28.26
and you compromise to come to a conclusion?

3750
02:42:28.26 --> 02:42:28.76
Yeah.

3751
02:42:28.76 --> 02:42:30.38
Do you compromise when you're on a team

3752
02:42:30.38 --> 02:42:32.10
and you're working together and someone's got one plan

3753
02:42:32.10 --> 02:42:34.26
and you've got a different idea and you compromise to make

3754
02:42:34.26 --> 02:42:34.66
things work?

3755
02:42:34.66 --> 02:42:35.58
Yes, absolutely.

3756
02:42:35.58 --> 02:42:38.90
Do you compromise when you negotiate to make a deal happen?

3757
02:42:38.90 --> 02:42:40.54
Yes, you absolutely do.

3758
02:42:40.54 --> 02:42:42.02
So in life, you've got to compromise.

3759
02:42:42.02 --> 02:42:46.10
But there's things also in life that you don't compromise on

3760
02:42:46.10 --> 02:42:47.70
and where you hold the line.

3761
02:42:47.70 --> 02:42:49.46
And that's what we're doing here.

3762
02:42:49.46 --> 02:42:50.66
We're doing it at Jock of Fuel.

3763
02:42:50.66 --> 02:42:52.18
We're doing it at Origin.

3764
02:42:52.18 --> 02:42:53.74
We're not going to compromise.

3765
02:42:53.74 --> 02:42:55.06
We're going to hold the line.

3766
02:42:55.06 --> 02:42:56.86
And the reason we're able to do that

3767
02:42:56.86 --> 02:42:58.78
is because everyone that's listening to this right now.

3768
02:42:58.78 --> 02:43:01.86
So none of this happens.

3769
02:43:01.86 --> 02:43:03.18
None of this.

3770
02:43:03.18 --> 02:43:03.90
Nothing.

3771
02:43:03.90 --> 02:43:04.74
This doesn't exist.

3772
02:43:04.74 --> 02:43:08.22
What we're talking about doesn't exist without you

3773
02:43:08.22 --> 02:43:11.42
that's sitting there listening to this podcast right now,

3774
02:43:11.42 --> 02:43:13.70
listening to what we're doing, participating

3775
02:43:13.70 --> 02:43:15.78
in what we're doing without your support.

3776
02:43:15.78 --> 02:43:17.34
None of this happens.

3777
02:43:17.34 --> 02:43:21.30
So thank you for your support.

3778
02:43:21.30 --> 02:43:24.14
And I'm going to tell you right now,

3779
02:43:24.14 --> 02:43:25.54
we will not let you down.

3780
02:43:29.46 --> 02:43:30.26
Echo Charles.

3781
02:43:30.26 --> 02:43:32.26
Yes, sir.

3782
02:43:32.26 --> 02:43:36.74
How can people support the podcast?

3783
02:43:36.74 --> 02:43:37.98
How can they support themselves?

3784
02:43:37.98 --> 02:43:40.14
How can they support these companies?

3785
02:43:40.14 --> 02:43:42.90
And how can they in doing so support America?

3786
02:43:42.90 --> 02:43:43.42
What do you got?

3787
02:43:43.42 --> 02:43:44.18
What do you got to do?

3788
02:43:44.18 --> 02:43:46.74
Well, some of this is just one big reminder,

3789
02:43:46.74 --> 02:43:49.30
because you guys been kind of talking about it for a long time.

3790
02:43:49.30 --> 02:43:52.86
But yeah, so reminder or a recap, we'll say.

3791
02:43:52.86 --> 02:43:54.06
JacoFuel.com.

3792
02:43:54.06 --> 02:43:55.70
JacoFuel.com.

3793
02:43:55.70 --> 02:43:59.26
We got Moq, the new Moq RTD is ready to drink

3794
02:43:59.26 --> 02:44:00.02
if you didn't pick that up.

3795
02:44:00.02 --> 02:44:01.50
Not yet online.

3796
02:44:01.50 --> 02:44:02.50
It's not yet online.

3797
02:44:02.50 --> 02:44:03.62
No, not yet.

3798
02:44:03.62 --> 02:44:04.78
We haven't made enough yet for a while.

3799
02:44:04.78 --> 02:44:06.02
Yeah, we have made enough yet.

3800
02:44:06.02 --> 02:44:06.38
OK.

3801
02:44:06.38 --> 02:44:06.94
But soon.

3802
02:44:06.94 --> 02:44:08.18
We'll be on the lookout for that one.

3803
02:44:08.18 --> 02:44:09.06
How about that?

3804
02:44:09.06 --> 02:44:10.46
Because we're over here all week drill.

3805
02:44:10.46 --> 02:44:10.98
Not only.

3806
02:44:10.98 --> 02:44:11.86
They kind of ran out quick.

3807
02:44:11.86 --> 02:44:15.22
But we stole some from the warehouse to drink this week.

3808
02:44:15.22 --> 02:44:16.74
Yeah, we experienced that one.

3809
02:44:16.74 --> 02:44:17.22
That's good.

3810
02:44:17.22 --> 02:44:20.46
A little detail that I noticed about the RTD,

3811
02:44:20.46 --> 02:44:22.62
they're like, you'd think the powder is more versatile,

3812
02:44:22.62 --> 02:44:24.38
because you can mix stuff in the thing.

3813
02:44:24.38 --> 02:44:26.86
But this becomes more versatile in a different way,

3814
02:44:26.86 --> 02:44:30.26
because you can use it on other things, like cereal, cookies.

3815
02:44:30.26 --> 02:44:31.74
I'm not saying I did that.

3816
02:44:31.74 --> 02:44:32.86
I'm not saying I didn't do that.

3817
02:44:32.86 --> 02:44:35.74
But I'm just saying you'll put it on other stuff.

3818
02:44:35.74 --> 02:44:37.66
Typically, you don't mix a protein shake,

3819
02:44:37.66 --> 02:44:39.90
add your favorite this and that, and then put it on.

3820
02:44:39.90 --> 02:44:41.22
So you don't do that usually.

3821
02:44:41.22 --> 02:44:43.06
But this one, you do that.

3822
02:44:43.06 --> 02:44:44.70
I think we all found that out pretty quick,

3823
02:44:44.70 --> 02:44:46.70
because I saw a lot of people doing that stuff.

3824
02:44:46.70 --> 02:44:50.34
I like the double hitter, mulking one hand, going the other.

3825
02:44:50.34 --> 02:44:51.70
It's a good morning double hitter.

3826
02:44:51.70 --> 02:44:53.14
You know what I'm saying?

3827
02:44:53.14 --> 02:44:54.14
Mulking go, baby.

3828
02:44:54.14 --> 02:44:55.02
Mulking go.

3829
02:44:55.02 --> 02:44:56.98
That makes complete sense to me.

3830
02:44:56.98 --> 02:45:00.70
Also, a reminder, or we didn't talk about the joint warfare

3831
02:45:00.70 --> 02:45:03.26
stuff or whatever, but yeah, just look after your joints.

3832
02:45:03.26 --> 02:45:05.34
We're not getting younger.

3833
02:45:05.34 --> 02:45:06.26
Look out for your joints.

3834
02:45:06.26 --> 02:45:06.86
Are you getting older?

3835
02:45:06.86 --> 02:45:07.62
Don't pay attention.

3836
02:45:07.62 --> 02:45:10.82
I'm over here doing the best I can.

3837
02:45:10.82 --> 02:45:12.82
So yes, joint warfare, supercrill oil,

3838
02:45:12.82 --> 02:45:15.42
got some vitamin D3, general health.

3839
02:45:15.42 --> 02:45:16.58
These are important things.

3840
02:45:16.58 --> 02:45:20.50
If the what, if your oil runs out in your car, right?

3841
02:45:20.50 --> 02:45:20.86
That's a problem.

3842
02:45:20.86 --> 02:45:21.74
That's not good.

3843
02:45:21.74 --> 02:45:22.22
Yeah, yeah.

3844
02:45:22.22 --> 02:45:24.46
It's Dean Lister would say that's a problem.

3845
02:45:24.46 --> 02:45:28.46
Same anyway, so pay attention to these things.

3846
02:45:28.46 --> 02:45:30.34
Where a kid mucked us for the kids, of course,

3847
02:45:30.34 --> 02:45:32.22
like the kids version.

3848
02:45:32.22 --> 02:45:35.70
Yeah, all this stuff at jockelfield.com and also other places.

3849
02:45:35.70 --> 02:45:38.54
Yeah, also you can get the drinks at Wawa.

3850
02:45:38.54 --> 02:45:41.94
Actually, the RTD muck is going into Wawa.

3851
02:45:41.94 --> 02:45:42.30
It is.

3852
02:45:42.30 --> 02:45:44.42
We already shipped, I believe.

3853
02:45:44.42 --> 02:45:48.18
So if you're East Coast, you got that Wawa going there

3854
02:45:48.18 --> 02:45:50.90
and get that muck later.

3855
02:45:50.90 --> 02:45:54.86
And it should be it should be going in by like it goes.

3856
02:45:54.86 --> 02:45:56.86
It gets shipped to there, whatever.

3857
02:45:56.86 --> 02:45:58.14
And then they ship it to the store.

3858
02:45:58.14 --> 02:46:02.22
So between mid and end of September, it'll be in.

3859
02:46:02.22 --> 02:46:07.22
And it's muck and go people and maybe grab a hoagie too.

3860
02:46:09.70 --> 02:46:12.82
Vitamin shop, H E B.

3861
02:46:12.82 --> 02:46:16.46
There's I failed to get this list on here.

3862
02:46:16.46 --> 02:46:17.70
We're in a bunch of retailers.

3863
02:46:17.70 --> 02:46:19.22
We'll get that out to you.

3864
02:46:19.22 --> 02:46:21.26
I need to add that into this so you all know.

3865
02:46:21.26 --> 02:46:26.78
So jockelfield.com, you can get on Amazon as well.

3866
02:46:26.78 --> 02:46:27.78
There you go.

3868
02:46:29.94 --> 02:46:32.26

Boots, jeans, keys, rash guards, spats.

And the Hunt Line.

3871
02:46:38.10 --> 02:46:40.06
The entire Hunt Line.

3872
02:46:40.06 --> 02:46:42.94
It's available, go get some of that.

3873
02:46:42.94 --> 02:46:43.86

3876
02:46:46.58 --> 02:46:47.42
Echo Charles.

3877
02:46:47.42 --> 02:46:48.34
We're all on the path.

3878
02:46:48.34 --> 02:46:49.34
You know, you want to represent.

3879
02:46:49.34 --> 02:46:50.42
Displaining freedom.

3880
02:46:50.42 --> 02:46:51.54
Let's not forget about that.

3881
02:46:51.54 --> 02:46:52.54
No, we definitely don't.

3882
02:46:52.54 --> 02:46:53.38
You know the roots.

3883
02:46:53.38 --> 02:46:54.22
We don't know about that one.

3884
02:46:54.22 --> 02:46:55.38
Packard roots.

3885
02:46:55.38 --> 02:46:56.38
You want to represent that.

3886
02:46:56.38 --> 02:46:59.10
That's where you can get that stuff at jockelstore.com.

3887
02:46:59.10 --> 02:47:02.42
We got the short locker, which is the subscription.

3888
02:47:02.42 --> 02:47:04.26
New design every month.

3889
02:47:04.26 --> 02:47:05.86
I've seen a lot of representation.

3890
02:47:05.86 --> 02:47:08.14
There's a lot of people in Maine on that subscription, bro.

3891
02:47:08.14 --> 02:47:11.14
There's a lot of people camp on that subscription, bro.

3892
02:47:11.14 --> 02:47:13.22
It's friggin legit.

3893
02:47:13.22 --> 02:47:14.14
They're looking good.

3894
02:47:14.14 --> 02:47:17.02
That's like flying, kind of like flying the flag old school.

3895
02:47:17.02 --> 02:47:18.14
Yes, sir.

3896
02:47:18.14 --> 02:47:20.50
This is, hey, yeah.

3897
02:47:20.50 --> 02:47:22.22
Do you call it the subscript?

3898
02:47:22.22 --> 02:47:24.54
Are you like, you got to get on that subscript?

3899
02:47:24.54 --> 02:47:25.62
Subscrips.

3900
02:47:25.62 --> 02:47:26.42
Yeah, sometimes.

3901
02:47:26.42 --> 02:47:27.94
Subscription might be subscript.

3902
02:47:27.94 --> 02:47:30.26
On an official level, it's called the short locker.

3903
02:47:30.26 --> 02:47:31.10
The short locker.

3904
02:47:31.10 --> 02:47:33.90
Like the SURT, you know, her locker.

3905
02:47:33.90 --> 02:47:35.74
I got what you're putting down, man.

3906
02:47:35.74 --> 02:47:37.34
Come on, man.

3907
02:47:37.34 --> 02:47:38.42
But yeah, this is a good one.

3908
02:47:38.42 --> 02:47:39.74
A lot of good feedback on that one.

3909
02:47:39.74 --> 02:47:41.54

I got a bunch of books.

3916
02:47:49.50 --> 02:47:51.30
Check them out.

3917
02:47:51.30 --> 02:47:55.06
Only Cry for the Living by Holly McKay.

3918
02:47:55.06 --> 02:47:57.30
That girl risked her life to go in and write these books,

3919
02:47:57.30 --> 02:47:58.62
go in there and buy that book.

3920
02:47:58.62 --> 02:47:59.22
See that story.

3921
02:47:59.22 --> 02:48:03.54
See what war is like, like almost as it's unfolding.

3922
02:48:03.54 --> 02:48:04.66
My wife's reading it right now.

3923
02:48:04.66 --> 02:48:05.62
She's really enjoying it.

3924
02:48:05.62 --> 02:48:06.70
It's really good book.

3925
02:48:06.70 --> 02:48:07.70
Yeah.

3926
02:48:07.70 --> 02:48:08.82
Enjoy might be the wrong word.

3927
02:48:08.82 --> 02:48:09.98
Because it's hard to enjoy.

3928
02:48:09.98 --> 02:48:10.78
She's engaged.

3929
02:48:10.78 --> 02:48:11.46
She's engaged.

3930
02:48:11.46 --> 02:48:12.74
She's really engaged with the book.

3931
02:48:12.74 --> 02:48:14.06
It's a tough one.

3932
02:48:14.06 --> 02:48:14.58
Yeah.

3933
02:48:14.58 --> 02:48:15.86
You know I wrote a bunch of other books.

3934
02:48:15.86 --> 02:48:16.26

Merging of culture.

3940

Performance.

3941

The event that you talked about, Pete, that Jason came to.

3946
02:48:36.62 --> 02:48:38.38
It's called the muster.

3947
02:48:38.38 --> 02:48:39.22
The next one is Atlanta.

3948
02:48:39.22 --> 02:48:40.30
Unfortunately, it's sold out.

3949
02:48:40.30 --> 02:48:42.38

might not be able to come to a live event.

3953

Yeah.

3958
02:48:53.50 --> 02:48:53.78
Oh, yeah.

3959
02:48:53.78 --> 02:48:55.62
A bunch of people from Origin are on there,

3960
02:48:55.62 --> 02:48:57.18
which is awesome to see.

3961
02:48:57.18 --> 02:49:00.14
And we have live sessions.

3962
02:49:00.14 --> 02:49:01.02
We do.

3963
02:49:01.02 --> 02:49:02.82
We have prerecorded training sessions.

3964
02:49:02.82 --> 02:49:05.54
It's just a way to train leadership.

3965
02:49:05.54 --> 02:49:07.02
Like, and this is the interesting thing.

3966
02:49:07.02 --> 02:49:09.06
Years ago, if someone had said, hey,

3967
02:49:09.06 --> 02:49:13.02
people are going to learn Jiu-Jitsu by online academies,

3968
02:49:13.02 --> 02:49:13.94
what would you have thought?

3969
02:49:13.94 --> 02:49:14.50
Hell no.

3970
02:49:14.50 --> 02:49:14.82
Hell no.

3971
02:49:14.82 --> 02:49:15.94
What do you think now?

3972
02:49:15.94 --> 02:49:16.78
Oh, hell yeah.

3973
02:49:16.78 --> 02:49:17.86
I mean, I do.

3974
02:49:17.86 --> 02:49:18.34
Yeah.

3975
02:49:18.34 --> 02:49:19.34
Hell yes.

3976
02:49:19.34 --> 02:49:21.70
So it's the same thing with leadership.

3977
02:49:21.70 --> 02:49:24.30
And by the way, just like Jiu-Jitsu or playing guitar

3978
02:49:24.30 --> 02:49:26.82
or playing basketball, you're not born with the skills.

3979
02:49:26.82 --> 02:49:27.70
You need to learn them.

3980
02:49:27.70 --> 02:49:29.22
Same thing with leadership.

3981
02:49:29.22 --> 02:49:31.70
We made an online training academy, extremeownership.com.

3982
02:49:31.70 --> 02:49:32.30
Go check that out.

3983
02:49:32.30 --> 02:49:34.18
Help you with leadership.

3984
02:49:34.18 --> 02:49:36.82
And it doesn't mean you're in charge of 420 people

3985
02:49:36.82 --> 02:49:39.98
at your company.

3986
02:49:39.98 --> 02:49:42.50
If you're alive and you interact with other human beings,

3987
02:49:42.50 --> 02:49:44.18
you're in a leadership position.

3988
02:49:44.18 --> 02:49:45.66
And you're leading them.

3989
02:49:45.66 --> 02:49:48.46
So go and check that out.

3990
02:49:48.46 --> 02:49:51.70
If you want to help out some service members,

3991
02:49:51.70 --> 02:49:53.58
active and retired, you want to help out their families,

3992
02:49:53.58 --> 02:49:55.46
Gold Star families, check out Mark Lee's mom.

3993
02:49:55.46 --> 02:49:59.34
She's got an unbelievable charity organization.

3994
02:49:59.34 --> 02:50:02.30
What they do is they help vets with their health

3995
02:50:02.30 --> 02:50:05.02
and give them solutions to their health

3996
02:50:05.02 --> 02:50:07.42
that the VA doesn't cover.

3997
02:50:07.42 --> 02:50:09.54
So it's just an outstanding organization.

3998
02:50:09.54 --> 02:50:11.10
She's an unbelievable woman.

3999
02:50:11.10 --> 02:50:15.82
AmericasMightyWarriors.org, if you want to donate

4000
02:50:15.82 --> 02:50:16.98
or you want to get involved.

4001
02:50:16.98 --> 02:50:18.86
Also, check out Micah Fink.

4002
02:50:18.86 --> 02:50:23.02
He's up there taking vets into the wilderness on horses

4003
02:50:23.02 --> 02:50:28.10
for 41 days where they can find themselves, heroes

4004
02:50:28.10 --> 02:50:32.26
and horses.org, an incredible organization.

4005
02:50:32.26 --> 02:50:34.70
The social media thing.

4006
02:50:34.70 --> 02:50:36.30
It's a double-edged sword.

4007
02:50:36.30 --> 02:50:37.14
We get it.

4008
02:50:37.14 --> 02:50:38.70
There's an algorithm that's trying to grab you.

4009
02:50:38.70 --> 02:50:40.82
It's trying to waste your time.

4010
02:50:40.82 --> 02:50:43.10
There's also some positive that can come out of it.

4011
02:50:43.10 --> 02:50:48.62
If you want to follow on the social media,

4012
02:50:48.62 --> 02:50:50.22
JockoFuel is at JockoFuel.

4013
02:50:50.22 --> 02:50:51.46
Go check that one out.

4014
02:50:51.46 --> 02:50:53.26
Go check out JockoFuel so you know what's happening.

4015
02:50:53.26 --> 02:50:54.54
You know where you can buy stuff.

4016
02:50:54.54 --> 02:50:57.90
You know when new stuff comes out at JockoFuel.

4017
02:50:57.90 --> 02:51:02.22
Check that one out at OriginUSA on Instagram.

4018
02:51:02.22 --> 02:51:03.54
That's where Origin's at.

4019
02:51:03.54 --> 02:51:06.50
Pete's actually at Pete.origin.

4020
02:51:06.50 --> 02:51:08.10
Still haven't gotten that blue check.

4021
02:51:08.10 --> 02:51:10.50
We talked about it last year.

4022
02:51:10.50 --> 02:51:13.22
They don't know love for the Yankee.

4023
02:51:13.22 --> 02:51:14.78
For the Yankee.

4024
02:51:14.78 --> 02:51:17.86
Oh, like the confirmed.

4025
02:51:17.86 --> 02:51:18.70
Are you confirmed?

4026
02:51:18.70 --> 02:51:20.54
I got so many fake accounts now, man.

4027
02:51:20.54 --> 02:51:22.26
I get emails every day from people

4028
02:51:22.26 --> 02:51:25.42
and they're soliciting them for crypto stuff.

4029
02:51:25.42 --> 02:51:26.30
New accounts all the time.

4030
02:51:26.30 --> 02:51:28.66
Make any big investments there in the crypto world

4031
02:51:28.66 --> 02:51:30.34
through some random dude on Instagram.

4032
02:51:30.34 --> 02:51:32.70
That sounds like a good plan.

4033
02:51:32.70 --> 02:51:34.22
Yeah, so check that out.

4034
02:51:34.22 --> 02:51:34.82
Check out Pete.

4035
02:51:34.82 --> 02:51:35.42
Check out Origin.

4036
02:51:35.42 --> 02:51:38.38
Check out JockoFuel if you want to check out Echo and me.

4037
02:51:38.38 --> 02:51:39.42
Echo's at Echo Charles.

4038
02:51:39.42 --> 02:51:40.90
I am at JockoWilling.

4039
02:51:40.90 --> 02:51:44.06
And Pete, thanks once again.

4040
02:51:44.06 --> 02:51:45.18
Thank you.

4041
02:51:45.18 --> 02:51:48.10
Thanks for all you've done and all you're doing.

4042
02:51:48.10 --> 02:51:50.54
You know, you went out there with your friends and family

4043
02:51:50.54 --> 02:51:52.38
and cut down a bunch of trees in the middle of the woods

4044
02:51:52.38 --> 02:51:53.58
to make a factory.

4045
02:51:53.58 --> 02:51:57.98
And that took some serious guts to do and you did it.

4046
02:51:57.98 --> 02:51:59.50
And we appreciate that.

4047
02:51:59.50 --> 02:52:04.78
And on top of that, thanks to all the hardworking people

4048
02:52:04.78 --> 02:52:10.02
at Origin USA and JockoFuel who are out there cutting and sewing

4049
02:52:10.02 --> 02:52:13.66
and designing and creating and packing and shipping

4050
02:52:13.66 --> 02:52:15.74
and cleaning and working.

4051
02:52:18.54 --> 02:52:20.86
Thanks to all of you for everything that you do.

4052
02:52:20.86 --> 02:52:23.62
You all are the backbone of these companies.

4053
02:52:23.62 --> 02:52:25.42
And we thank you for your hard work

4054
02:52:25.42 --> 02:52:28.14
and your commitment to this dream.

4055
02:52:28.14 --> 02:52:29.02
And you know what?

4056
02:52:29.02 --> 02:52:33.10
To all the hardworking men and women of this great nation.

4057
02:52:33.10 --> 02:52:34.74
And you're out there.

4058
02:52:34.74 --> 02:52:39.66
I see you all the time in the fields and in the factories,

4059
02:52:39.66 --> 02:52:41.90
on the construction sites and in the cubicles,

4060
02:52:41.90 --> 02:52:44.90
on the oil rigs and the utility poles and hospitals

4061
02:52:44.90 --> 02:52:48.62
and hotels and restaurants and warehouses.

4062
02:52:48.62 --> 02:52:51.66
To all of you that toil and labor every day,

4063
02:52:51.66 --> 02:52:55.30
thank you for what you do.

4064
02:52:55.30 --> 02:52:58.74
It's what allows the lights to come on.

4065
02:52:58.74 --> 02:52:59.62
And we appreciate it.

4066
02:52:59.62 --> 02:53:01.30
And thanks to all the military out there

4067
02:53:01.30 --> 02:53:04.62
for protecting the freedom that we have that allows us

4068
02:53:04.62 --> 02:53:06.58
to do what we're doing.

4069
02:53:06.58 --> 02:53:12.42
And we will do our part to build the economy and support you.

4070
02:53:12.42 --> 02:53:15.70
And also thanks to police and law enforcement, firefighters,

4071
02:53:15.70 --> 02:53:18.50
paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, correctional officers,

4072
02:53:18.50 --> 02:53:22.42
border patrol, secret service, and all first responders.

4073
02:53:22.42 --> 02:53:26.50
Thank you for protecting our safety and security here at home

4074
02:53:26.50 --> 02:53:30.82
and everyone else out there.

4075
02:53:30.82 --> 02:53:32.90
Thank you.

4076
02:53:32.90 --> 02:53:36.38
Thank you for your support.

4077
02:53:36.38 --> 02:53:40.46
Thank you for listening and thank you for believing.

4078
02:53:40.46 --> 02:53:44.54
And thank you for understanding what is at risk.

4079
02:53:44.54 --> 02:53:47.82
And thank you for seeing what is happening in the world

4080
02:53:47.82 --> 02:53:51.30
and seeing the darkness in the world.

4081
02:53:51.30 --> 02:53:54.82
But still moving toward the light.

4082
02:53:54.82 --> 02:53:57.42
Freedom is not free.

4083
02:53:57.42 --> 02:53:59.50
It takes sacrifice.

4084
02:53:59.50 --> 02:54:00.82
It takes guts.

4085
02:54:00.82 --> 02:54:02.14
And it takes grit.

4086
02:54:02.14 --> 02:54:06.70
And it takes work.

4087
02:54:06.70 --> 02:54:11.22
So let's go get after it and get to work.

4088
02:54:11.22 --> 02:54:15.42
And until next time, this is Pete and Echo and Jaco.

4089
02:54:15.42 --> 02:54:21.42
Thank you for watching.
