00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.40
Revenge, revenge, revenge.

2
00:00:03.40 --> 00:00:05.76
Let us kill.

3
00:00:05.76 --> 00:00:07.48
Let us cut to pieces.

4
00:00:07.48 --> 00:00:10.24
Let us swim and blood up to our knees.

5
00:00:10.24 --> 00:00:14.64
Revenge, revenge, revenge.

6
00:00:14.64 --> 00:00:21.16
Let us wipe the stain from our clothes.

7
00:00:21.16 --> 00:00:29.88
That is a song taught to Turkish school children as reported by the US Consulate.

8
00:00:29.88 --> 00:00:37.52
In February of 1915, and this is Jockel Podcast number 280, with echo Charles and me,

9
00:00:37.52 --> 00:00:38.52
Jockel Willink.

10
00:00:38.52 --> 00:00:39.52
Good evening, echo.

11
00:00:39.52 --> 00:00:40.52
Good evening.

12
00:00:40.52 --> 00:00:42.64
Also, joining us tonight is Darrell Cooper.

13
00:00:42.64 --> 00:00:48.44
Good evening.

14
00:00:48.44 --> 00:00:55.92
And the blood spread step by step from Ankara to Distant Cities Towns and Villages.

15
00:00:55.92 --> 00:01:03.44
At the end of August 1915, a girl barely 13 years old told me of the following to which she

16
00:01:03.44 --> 00:01:08.88
had been an eyewitness and which she only by some miracle had survived.

17
00:01:08.88 --> 00:01:17.08
In mid-August, all our menion males from 12 to 80 were arrested, taken out of town and

18
00:01:17.08 --> 00:01:21.24
killed by unheard of tortures.

19
00:01:21.24 --> 00:01:27.84
It was the turn of the girls and women.

20
00:01:27.84 --> 00:01:31.28
On August 20, all the Armenian women, girls and small boys were taken out into more than 70

21
00:01:31.28 --> 00:01:36.08
carriages and brought to a valley by a bridge an hour and a half away.

22
00:01:36.08 --> 00:01:42.000
Following these carriages from the town was an armed mob of Turks, each of whom on the

23
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.20
way chose a sheep or lamb to slaughter.

24
00:01:47.20 --> 00:01:52.96
And they reached the area under the bridge, police and soldiers having joined the savage

25
00:01:52.96 --> 00:02:03.28
mob set upon these poor, defenseless women, mothers, brides, virgins and children.

26
00:02:03.28 --> 00:02:09.28
Just as spring trees are cut down with bill hooked, hedge knives, the blood thirsty mob

27
00:02:09.28 --> 00:02:14.16
attacked this group more than 400.

28
00:02:14.16 --> 00:02:21.48
With axes, hatchets, shovels and pitchforks, hacking off their appendages, noses, ears, legs,

29
00:02:21.48 --> 00:02:26.84
arms, fingers, shoulders, they dash the little children against the rocks before their

30
00:02:26.84 --> 00:02:36.08
eyes of their mothers while shouting, Allah, Allah.

31
00:02:36.08 --> 00:02:40.12
The screams of the mothers and virgins and little children echoed across the valley in

32
00:02:40.12 --> 00:02:47.40
the surrounding rocky hills and caves that children screamed, may rig, may rig, mother,

33
00:02:47.40 --> 00:02:51.80
mother, help us please.

34
00:02:51.80 --> 00:03:00.28
But the mob indifferent continued to rip apart the bodies so that even the stones cried

35
00:03:00.28 --> 00:03:05.000
out.

36
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.36
And we after four to five hours of carnage and plunder, nights black, blanket covered this

37
00:03:10.36 --> 00:03:18.44
scene of blood which would stir the envy of wild animals.

38
00:03:18.44 --> 00:03:23.32
With the fall of night, the Turkish mob, police and police soldiers returned to town with

39
00:03:23.32 --> 00:03:27.56
their bundles of loot, whatever they had left.

40
00:03:27.56 --> 00:03:36.72
Hyenas, wolves, jackals and other scavengers came off to finish.

41
00:03:36.72 --> 00:03:43.92
The precipices of the valley were strewn with corpses naked or half naked.

42
00:03:43.92 --> 00:03:49.80
It was a scene beyond all human imagination.

43
00:03:49.80 --> 00:03:55.44
Now in then, in the darkness of the night, the moans and groans of the badly wounded, then

44
00:03:55.44 --> 00:04:03.52
the raspy drone of those giving up the ghost could be heard.

45
00:04:03.52 --> 00:04:10.24
After midnight, in the thick darkness, a refreshing dew began to fall.

46
00:04:10.24 --> 00:04:20.16
And behold, a slightly wounded, numb little girl, invigorated by the dew woke up.

47
00:04:20.16 --> 00:04:27.12
After alive, she began to roll over and search for mother and two sisters.

48
00:04:27.12 --> 00:04:34.68
In vain, she called them by name, but alas they were gone to eternal sleep.

49
00:04:34.68 --> 00:04:43.28
At last, she found their crushed bodies which had fallen one beside the other.

50
00:04:43.28 --> 00:04:46.72
In shock, the girl began to shake and sob uncontrollably.

51
00:04:46.72 --> 00:04:50.88
Her teeth chattering, she did not move from that spot until morning, as if the bodies

52
00:04:50.88 --> 00:04:59.60
of her mother and her older sisters compelled her to stay there.

53
00:04:59.60 --> 00:05:05.60
At dawn, a few of the Kurdish cowhurters crossing the bridge in the vicinity of this

54
00:05:05.60 --> 00:05:11.76
carnage saw one of the corpses moving in the distance.

55
00:05:11.76 --> 00:05:19.64
They approached her, took pity on her, and brought her home to their father's care.

56
00:05:19.64 --> 00:05:27.68
Being an anti-turk Muslim Kurdish, he secretly turned her over to his long-time friend.

57
00:05:27.68 --> 00:05:31.44
It was with the arrival of this little girl in the town where we were staying that for

58
00:05:31.44 --> 00:05:37.60
the first time, we became aware of the extent of the killing being carried out around

59
00:05:37.60 --> 00:05:44.60
us without a sound or whisperer.

60
00:05:44.60 --> 00:06:02.60
And that is an excerpt from a book called Armenian Golgotha by a man named Gregoris Polakian.

61
00:06:02.60 --> 00:06:16.60
And then Gregoris was born in 1875 in Tocat, part of the Ottoman Empire, educated in Germany.

62
00:06:16.60 --> 00:06:25.96
Eventually became a celibate priest in the Armenian apostolic church.

63
00:06:25.96 --> 00:06:33.52
He was one of the countless Armenians who suffered through the Armenian genocide.

64
00:06:33.52 --> 00:06:39.48
He was one of the lucky ones that actually survived and he wrote a book about his experiences.

65
00:06:39.48 --> 00:06:43.08
And like I said, the book is called Armenian Golgotha.

66
00:06:43.08 --> 00:06:55.92
If you don't know what Golgotha is, Golgotha is the name of the hill where Jesus was crucified.

67
00:06:55.92 --> 00:07:05.40
And this event is where the Armenians as a people were crucified and where as individuals

68
00:07:05.40 --> 00:07:14.76
for many a mere crucifixion would have been merciful.

69
00:07:14.76 --> 00:07:21.92
But before we jump into more of the book, I wanted to go into some of the background.

70
00:07:21.92 --> 00:07:29.52
And this event is not as well known as some other genocides.

71
00:07:29.52 --> 00:07:32.40
So Darrell, let's talk about how we got here.

72
00:07:32.40 --> 00:07:38.64
And what are some of the similarities and differences about what happened to the Armenians

73
00:07:38.64 --> 00:07:44.76
and what has happened to some other persecuted groups in the past?

74
00:07:44.76 --> 00:07:46.92
What's the background here?

75
00:07:46.92 --> 00:07:53.40
There's some people that called the 20th century the century of genocide.

76
00:07:53.40 --> 00:07:57.72
You look all throughout history and there's no shortage of mass killing of human beings

77
00:07:57.72 --> 00:08:00.72
by other human beings.

78
00:08:00.72 --> 00:08:05.48
In fact, if you go all the way back to like our tribal times, warfare by genocide was

79
00:08:05.48 --> 00:08:06.64
pretty typical.

80
00:08:06.64 --> 00:08:09.92
You had nomadic tribes, they didn't have prisons, they didn't have jails, they didn't have

81
00:08:09.92 --> 00:08:11.68
POW camps or anything like that.

82
00:08:11.68 --> 00:08:15.64
If you conquered another tribe, their men were going to be a problem and you didn't have

83
00:08:15.64 --> 00:08:16.64
any way to keep them.

84
00:08:16.64 --> 00:08:20.84
And so the standard operating procedure was you just took them out, took the women that

85
00:08:20.84 --> 00:08:25.88
were willing to sort of, I guess, get over it back to your tribe with you, raise the children

86
00:08:25.88 --> 00:08:28.60
as your own.

87
00:08:28.60 --> 00:08:33.96
Almost like social mammals, like lions, somebody comes in, kills the male lion and now takes

88
00:08:33.96 --> 00:08:35.68
over the pride.

89
00:08:35.68 --> 00:08:43.32
As time developed, you started to get a sort of systematic civilized level of mass killing

90
00:08:43.32 --> 00:08:49.04
at scale that had never been possible in tribal times that you could only really, you could

91
00:08:49.04 --> 00:08:55.24
only manage with the same sort of administration and organization that allowed you to do

92
00:08:55.24 --> 00:08:59.92
things like build pyramids and all the great wonders of civilization.

93
00:08:59.92 --> 00:09:04.92
When you get up to the modern times, you get something that's even a little bit more,

94
00:09:04.92 --> 00:09:07.28
a little bit different than that.

95
00:09:07.28 --> 00:09:13.28
If we think back to say the Romans, what they did to Carthage had been giving Rome problems,

96
00:09:13.28 --> 00:09:16.72
and the rebel had been rampaging around the Italian peninsula, defeating their armies.

97
00:09:16.72 --> 00:09:20.32
And when they finally got to drop on the Carthage Indians, they said, salt the earth.

98
00:09:20.32 --> 00:09:22.68
We're not dealing with this anymore.

99
00:09:22.68 --> 00:09:25.92
Eliminate that threat for good and they did.

100
00:09:25.92 --> 00:09:29.60
When Caesar went up to Gaul, Rome had been sacked by Gaul before.

101
00:09:29.60 --> 00:09:31.64
It was a traumatic event in Roman history.

102
00:09:31.64 --> 00:09:36.88
And so when Caesar went up there and ended that threat thoroughly, you could think of it in

103
00:09:36.88 --> 00:09:37.88
a similar way.

104
00:09:37.88 --> 00:09:39.52
It was attached to conquest.

105
00:09:39.52 --> 00:09:42.16
And that's what you kind of saw throughout history.

106
00:09:42.16 --> 00:09:47.04
You get up to the 20th century, you see something in a way that's different and much darker,

107
00:09:47.04 --> 00:09:55.56
I think, which is you have established firmly established states, annihilating internal

108
00:09:55.56 --> 00:10:01.56
enemies according to the state, attacking captive populations over which they have complete

109
00:10:01.56 --> 00:10:03.88
power and control.

110
00:10:03.88 --> 00:10:07.80
You're not going in and eliminating a threat that exists over the horizon, making sure that

111
00:10:07.80 --> 00:10:09.84
it never returns.

112
00:10:09.84 --> 00:10:14.84
Now you're going into a prison where everybody's kept in a cell and one by one, these

113
00:10:14.84 --> 00:10:19.24
unarmed people, you're simply murdering all of these people over whom you have complete

114
00:10:19.24 --> 00:10:21.52
power.

115
00:10:21.52 --> 00:10:25.40
When you think of what happened to the Armenians, when you think of what happened to the

116
00:10:25.40 --> 00:10:29.52
Ukrainians under Stalin, to the Jews under Hitler, these are the kinds of things you see.

117
00:10:29.52 --> 00:10:34.56
This is a disarmed captive population that is not a threat.

118
00:10:34.56 --> 00:10:38.08
And there's no way out.

119
00:10:38.08 --> 00:10:40.88
And that's really the key characteristic of these events.

120
00:10:40.88 --> 00:10:45.28
Is if you go to those people and you saw this, you saw this with the Jews in Germany,

121
00:10:45.28 --> 00:10:48.44
you saw this with the Ukrainians, you saw this with the Armenians.

122
00:10:48.44 --> 00:10:53.20
Absolutely at the beginning of the First World War is a huge part of the population, including

123
00:10:53.20 --> 00:10:57.80
the leadership, is really actively asking the question, what can we do?

124
00:10:57.80 --> 00:10:58.80
What can we do?

125
00:10:58.80 --> 00:10:59.80
Like, what is it?

126
00:10:59.80 --> 00:11:04.04
It's the beginning of the First World War, the Armenians were flying Turkish flags,

127
00:11:04.04 --> 00:11:08.96
tens of thousands of them went right away enjoying the Turkish military, because they knew

128
00:11:08.96 --> 00:11:10.60
they had a history with the Turks.

129
00:11:10.60 --> 00:11:15.04
They had problems before, 20 years back, we'll talk about in a second, 300,000 or so of them

130
00:11:15.04 --> 00:11:17.48
got massacred.

131
00:11:17.48 --> 00:11:20.64
And they knew in the First World War, the tension was going to be high and the stress

132
00:11:20.64 --> 00:11:21.84
was going to be high.

133
00:11:21.84 --> 00:11:23.08
So what can we do?

134
00:11:23.08 --> 00:11:27.16
To show our loyalty to the Empire, to show that we're down for the cause.

135
00:11:27.16 --> 00:11:29.52
And the answer is, there's nothing you can do.

136
00:11:29.52 --> 00:11:31.16
There's nothing you can do.

137
00:11:31.16 --> 00:11:35.40
You're all going to be wiped out and there's nothing you can do.

138
00:11:35.40 --> 00:11:43.12
And it's the ultimate horror movie to have your state turn on you like that.

139
00:11:43.12 --> 00:11:49.92
And it's interesting that you say that the Armenian genocide isn't that well known, which

140
00:11:49.92 --> 00:11:52.92
is very, very true.

141
00:11:52.92 --> 00:11:56.76
Because it really is kind of the archetypal act of genocide in the 20th century.

142
00:11:56.76 --> 00:12:01.34
It was really like the first one early in the century that set the tone for all of the

143
00:12:01.34 --> 00:12:03.80
ones that came afterwards.

144
00:12:03.80 --> 00:12:08.52
And it was one of the most thorough and complete and systematic and intentional genocides

145
00:12:08.52 --> 00:12:14.08
that we have any record of.

146
00:12:14.08 --> 00:12:17.32
That erasure of genocide is something that you also see throughout history.

147
00:12:17.32 --> 00:12:21.84
I mean, how many countless people have been genocided throughout history that we don't

148
00:12:21.84 --> 00:12:23.52
even know their names.

149
00:12:23.52 --> 00:12:26.16
We'll never know their names.

150
00:12:26.16 --> 00:12:31.04
Maybe we even celebrate the history of the people who did it as a glorious civilization.

151
00:12:31.04 --> 00:12:36.56
And we will never know the names of the countless people that they completely wiped out.

152
00:12:36.56 --> 00:12:43.68
It's something that we don't like to mention or talk about or admit, but the fact is that

153
00:12:43.68 --> 00:12:48.40
more often than not if you look historically speaking, genocide tends to work.

154
00:12:48.40 --> 00:12:55.76
Not only are a lot of genocides physically successful, but more often than we would really

155
00:12:55.76 --> 00:13:04.40
prefer the one that does it ends up getting away with it and getting the message put

156
00:13:04.40 --> 00:13:08.76
out to the rest of the world and people in the future who might think of doing something

157
00:13:08.76 --> 00:13:10.88
similar that this is an option.

158
00:13:10.88 --> 00:13:15.36
In fact, when Adolf Hitler was contemplating his final solution for the Jewish question

159
00:13:15.36 --> 00:13:22.52
in Eastern Europe, he asked his commanding generals who today remembers the Armenians.

160
00:13:22.52 --> 00:13:24.52
Because the truth was nobody did.

161
00:13:24.52 --> 00:13:33.28
It's also interesting that in World War I there was plenty of Jews that fought for Germany.

162
00:13:33.28 --> 00:13:35.76
Well over 100,000.

163
00:13:35.76 --> 00:13:39.20
Valiantly, by the way.

164
00:13:39.20 --> 00:13:42.04
Hitler's life was saved by a Jewish soldier.

165
00:13:42.04 --> 00:13:50.04
He received his iron cross from a Jewish superior officer.

166
00:13:50.04 --> 00:13:59.92
So, as we push through this, let's talk about the relationship a little bit of the Turkish

167
00:13:59.92 --> 00:14:04.60
people and the Armenians in terms of how do we end up here?

168
00:14:04.60 --> 00:14:09.60
You know, I mentioned that it is really the archetypal genocide of the 20th century.

169
00:14:09.60 --> 00:14:14.48
I don't just say that because of the methods that were used, in fact, the methods that

170
00:14:14.48 --> 00:14:18.72
were used in a way where kind of an agronistic and unique to the Turkish Empire.

171
00:14:18.72 --> 00:14:24.04
It was archetypal of the 20th century genocides because of what you just asked.

172
00:14:24.04 --> 00:14:29.92
Because of the specific relationship between the dominant majority group and this particular

173
00:14:29.92 --> 00:14:32.20
Armenian minority.

174
00:14:32.20 --> 00:14:38.48
The Turks, the Ottoman Empire is a strange thing to study when you get up to the late

175
00:14:38.48 --> 00:14:39.88
period in the 20th century.

176
00:14:39.88 --> 00:14:44.52
Because if you ever asked yourself, what would it have been like if the gold and

177
00:14:44.52 --> 00:14:50.52
hoard or the Mongols or something had just they had managed to establish themselves somewhere

178
00:14:50.52 --> 00:14:53.04
on the outskirts of Europe and they lasted.

179
00:14:53.04 --> 00:14:56.48
You get all the way up to the 20th century and they're still there and they have an advanced

180
00:14:56.48 --> 00:14:57.48
civilization.

181
00:14:57.48 --> 00:15:02.000
Now, the gangas cons like descendants like they now have control, they have a big battle

182
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.84
fleet, they've got modern weaponry, I mean it's a big glorious civilization, Constantinople.

183
00:15:07.84 --> 00:15:14.12
You know, when the first world war kicked off, you're talking about one of the most sophisticated

184
00:15:14.12 --> 00:15:17.000
glorious cities in the world.

185
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.60
And the out of an empire gives you some idea of what it would be like if the golden

186
00:15:22.60 --> 00:15:25.000
hoard survived into the 20th century.

187
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:31.04
This is, you know, their Turkic peoples who came in as step warriors and conquered the Byzantine

188
00:15:31.04 --> 00:15:36.20
empire and took over all of North Africa, basically everything between Morocco and Persia

189
00:15:36.20 --> 00:15:38.56
and then down into Egypt.

190
00:15:38.56 --> 00:15:46.20
And so what you end up in a situation like this is you end up with like a war like people,

191
00:15:46.20 --> 00:15:47.20
right?

192
00:15:47.20 --> 00:15:48.20
That's what they are.

193
00:15:48.20 --> 00:15:55.48
When what they respect is war and being warriors and that sort of becomes the most

194
00:15:55.48 --> 00:15:57.48
respected class of people.

195
00:15:57.48 --> 00:15:58.48
Oh, yeah.

196
00:15:58.48 --> 00:16:05.60
Yeah, the idea in the major Islamic empires was always that we the majority population, the

197
00:16:05.60 --> 00:16:11.28
people in the commanding position of this society, we fight the wars and everybody else,

198
00:16:11.28 --> 00:16:14.68
the Christian and Jewish minority, for example, they pay for the wars.

199
00:16:14.68 --> 00:16:15.68
And that's how it works.

200
00:16:15.68 --> 00:16:16.68
We're a warrior people.

201
00:16:16.68 --> 00:16:22.40
I mean, these are step warriors who came and built up a big civilization and they kept

202
00:16:22.40 --> 00:16:27.40
a lot of that character even as they went forward, even as they were wearing suits and ties

203
00:16:27.40 --> 00:16:34.28
and, you know, going to to big security conferences and international conferences in Europe

204
00:16:34.28 --> 00:16:36.68
and the United States, they still had that in them.

205
00:16:36.68 --> 00:16:45.88
This was a warrior people from an age where it was perfectly typical to offer your enemies

206
00:16:45.88 --> 00:16:51.08
the option to either unconditionally surrender or be massacred totally.

207
00:16:51.08 --> 00:16:54.20
There was the mode of warfare on the step when they were conquering civilizations.

208
00:16:54.20 --> 00:16:57.84
It's how the Ottoman Empire got to where it was.

209
00:16:57.84 --> 00:17:04.24
And so as you move into modernity, you have this society there that up until you're

210
00:17:04.24 --> 00:17:11.24
still the early 1800s, still had its entire bureaucracy, governmental bureaucracy and most of

211
00:17:11.24 --> 00:17:17.40
its military, like its serious military officers, were still people who had been taken as slaves

212
00:17:17.40 --> 00:17:20.56
as children and brought back for that specific function.

213
00:17:20.56 --> 00:17:24.76
They would go up to the Balkans, they would go up into the Caucasus area because according

214
00:17:24.76 --> 00:17:27.04
to Islamic law, you can't in slave fellow Muslims.

215
00:17:27.04 --> 00:17:32.000
And so they would go into Christian areas and just go into a village and say, we need 10 people,

216
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.92
we need 10 male children, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.

217
00:17:35.92 --> 00:17:38.60
And they would do it the easy way because they knew what the hard way looked like, under

218
00:17:38.60 --> 00:17:43.88
the Ottoman Empire and it was no prettier than it got in the 20th century.

219
00:17:43.88 --> 00:17:50.60
And by the time they got up to the early 1800s, this group of bureaucrats and soldiers called

220
00:17:50.60 --> 00:17:56.96
the Janissaries, these were slave soldiers and bureaucrats who more or less ran the important

221
00:17:56.96 --> 00:17:58.72
functions of the empire.

222
00:17:58.72 --> 00:18:02.56
By the time you got up to the late 17 early 1800s, they were in fact running large sections

223
00:18:02.56 --> 00:18:04.36
of the economy.

224
00:18:04.36 --> 00:18:08.72
They held all the most important government positions and they were getting into this kind

225
00:18:08.72 --> 00:18:14.08
of strange place with the ruling elites, the ruling Turkish elites where the Turks are

226
00:18:14.08 --> 00:18:16.24
overall in charge.

227
00:18:16.24 --> 00:18:19.84
But this other group of people who are Muslim, they were born Christian children, but

228
00:18:19.84 --> 00:18:21.68
they were converted as children to Muslims.

229
00:18:21.68 --> 00:18:26.16
But that this identifiable group of people who has their own sense of themselves as an

230
00:18:26.16 --> 00:18:30.36
identifiable group, these Janissaries, that they have a tremendous amount of influence

231
00:18:30.36 --> 00:18:33.48
in power, that they're really the ones running the empire.

232
00:18:33.48 --> 00:18:36.72
And it got to a point where the government, the Turkish government, decided they couldn't

233
00:18:36.72 --> 00:18:39.88
trust these people anymore and they locked them all in their barracks one night and they

234
00:18:39.88 --> 00:18:42.72
burned them all the death.

235
00:18:42.72 --> 00:18:47.56
When they felt that this small minority group was accruing too much power and middle

236
00:18:47.56 --> 00:18:51.72
management where they kind of maybe probably could run the empire without the Turks if

237
00:18:51.72 --> 00:18:57.28
they really wanted to, their response was to wipe all of those people out overnight.

238
00:18:57.28 --> 00:18:58.28
And that's what they did.

239
00:18:58.28 --> 00:19:03.80
And it's known in Ottoman history, it was known in Ottoman history as the auspicious event.

240
00:19:03.80 --> 00:19:12.44
This is like a bunch of, let's say UFC fighters that are training hard, they fight, they

241
00:19:12.44 --> 00:19:19.52
punch each other, they kick each other, they wrestle and their agents and promoters are out

242
00:19:19.52 --> 00:19:23.12
there doing the work that they looked down upon, have not some promoter, I'm not some

243
00:19:23.12 --> 00:19:25.96
age and I'm the fighter.

244
00:19:25.96 --> 00:19:30.32
And then one day they look up and they go, wait a second, why is that guy driving a freaking

245
00:19:30.32 --> 00:19:36.32
unmercadies S class and I'm over here in a Toyota Camry and they get together and say,

246
00:19:36.32 --> 00:19:41.000
we're not going to do this anymore.

247
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
That's one way to look at it.

248
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.56
I mean, so in the thing that's so interesting about it, right, is if you look at what

249
00:19:45.56 --> 00:19:50.92
happened to the overseas Chinese population in Indonesia in the 1960s, if you look at what

250
00:19:50.92 --> 00:19:57.48
happened to the East Indian population of East Africa in the 1970s under like Idiamin and

251
00:19:57.48 --> 00:20:04.08
some others, if you look at what happened to the Jews in Europe, if there, there, you

252
00:20:04.08 --> 00:20:05.68
can go down the line.

253
00:20:05.68 --> 00:20:10.92
The people who are targeted are almost inevitably this similar group of people, right, if

254
00:20:10.92 --> 00:20:16.80
you look in Europe with the Jews for a long time, we were under a feudal system, the

255
00:20:16.80 --> 00:20:21.72
people who were in charge, the elites in a feudal system, they own all the land, the source

256
00:20:21.72 --> 00:20:26.76
of wealth in society is from the land, the majority of the local European population are

257
00:20:26.76 --> 00:20:30.36
all peasants or maybe small artisans.

258
00:20:30.36 --> 00:20:33.68
But then you have this group move in, you have the Jews move in and the Jews have been living

259
00:20:33.68 --> 00:20:37.92
in cities since the Romans kicked them out of Palestine, some of you even before that.

260
00:20:37.92 --> 00:20:42.60
So these are people who have lived in urban environment, they know how to engage in long

261
00:20:42.60 --> 00:20:47.84
distance trade, they know how to deal in like financial alchemy, they know how to do all,

262
00:20:47.84 --> 00:20:52.52
they know banking, they know law, they're all literate at a time when like 1% of your own

263
00:20:52.52 --> 00:20:55.84
population is literate because that's what these people do and they don't have their own

264
00:20:55.84 --> 00:20:57.80
place to live obviously.

265
00:20:57.80 --> 00:21:00.80
And so they go from place to place trying to survive saying what can we do here?

266
00:21:00.80 --> 00:21:04.60
We can't own land, only the nobility owns land, that's fine and the peasants work

267
00:21:04.60 --> 00:21:09.04
the land, but I'll bet you there's a lot of ways that we can help out and they bounced

268
00:21:09.04 --> 00:21:13.96
around Europe sometimes, accruing too much power, too much wealth and getting run out of

269
00:21:13.96 --> 00:21:17.08
their territory because the king decided he doesn't want to pay his debts or something

270
00:21:17.08 --> 00:21:20.32
like that, but that's how they survived, right?

271
00:21:20.32 --> 00:21:27.60
And it was fine, they fulfilled this middleman minority role for centuries and it was a role

272
00:21:27.60 --> 00:21:31.12
that sort of needed to be filled at a time when societies were kind of building themselves

273
00:21:31.12 --> 00:21:37.04
up to become more complex and sophisticated and didn't have that indigenous capacity.

274
00:21:37.04 --> 00:21:43.88
But then you get up to say that 1800s, maybe late 1700s depending on where you are and you

275
00:21:43.88 --> 00:21:50.88
have all these Jews who are engaged in things like banking, law, medicine, international

276
00:21:50.88 --> 00:21:54.44
trade, all of these things that the nobility didn't want to do and the peasants were

277
00:21:54.44 --> 00:21:57.68
incapable of doing and they're like, we'll just have the Jews do it because we don't

278
00:21:57.68 --> 00:22:00.28
like them anyway, their outsiders have them do it.

279
00:22:00.28 --> 00:22:04.68
We get up to like the 1800s and 1900s, what's every mother telling their kid that they

280
00:22:04.68 --> 00:22:05.68
should go do?

281
00:22:05.68 --> 00:22:09.64
Go be a lawyer, go be a banker, go be a doctor and so they were in prime position that

282
00:22:09.64 --> 00:22:14.64
when society started to change and the economy started to change, they were ready, they

283
00:22:14.64 --> 00:22:18.40
had been doing this stuff for a long time and they started to become very wealthy and

284
00:22:18.40 --> 00:22:25.52
very prominent and when that started to happen, you got a gigantic spike in antisemitism,

285
00:22:25.52 --> 00:22:28.36
you started seeing pogroms all over the place.

286
00:22:28.36 --> 00:22:33.88
You have this perfect storm too where you have like the nobility elite class who's turning

287
00:22:33.88 --> 00:22:38.92
against them and you also have the peasantry that says, wait a second, these people have

288
00:22:38.92 --> 00:22:42.96
all this money and it doesn't take very long for the nobility to lead the peasantry

289
00:22:42.96 --> 00:22:46.88
against the whatever class we're talking about, we could be talking about the Jews, we

290
00:22:46.88 --> 00:22:48.44
could be talking about the Armenians.

291
00:22:48.44 --> 00:22:53.20
100% especially since it redirects any anger they might have toward the people in charge

292
00:22:53.20 --> 00:22:58.000
to that layer below that intermediary and they would specifically use it for that purpose,

293
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.92
you know, they would use these people as tax collectors, they would use them as a state

294
00:23:01.92 --> 00:23:07.12
managers to manage the surfs and stuff because they knew that if things got out of hand,

295
00:23:07.12 --> 00:23:10.96
you know, and the peasant's rise up we can be like, yeah, you know, we knew that those

296
00:23:10.96 --> 00:23:16.000
Jews were were trouble all along, so go ahead, go nuts and that happened over and over

297
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.48
again throughout European history.

298
00:23:18.48 --> 00:23:26.000
So the Armenians followed a similar path, so after the janissaries, right, now this

299
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.48
means we now picked up where we killed the janissaries, now we need someone else to kind of

300
00:23:30.48 --> 00:23:32.08
it kind of come in here and run that run.

301
00:23:32.08 --> 00:23:35.36
So it's sort of worked out like that, but the Christians had always kind of been fulfilling

302
00:23:35.36 --> 00:23:37.12
those roles, right?

303
00:23:37.12 --> 00:23:42.08
The Christians and all the Islamic empires, if you go back and the Jews as well, they're usually

304
00:23:42.08 --> 00:23:45.76
urban populations, our Armenians are a little different and that's in that respect, we'll

305
00:23:45.76 --> 00:23:49.36
talk about in a second, but they were the ones who who naturally fulfilled those roles, the

306
00:23:49.36 --> 00:23:53.60
Turks, they were the warriors, you know, they're not going to go open the shop, you know, they're

307
00:23:53.60 --> 00:23:57.44
not doing banking and then you've got a lot of, you know, you got the Kurdish tribes, you've got

308
00:23:57.44 --> 00:24:01.68
these a lot of these semi-nomadic Arab villagers and stuff who were out there, you know, the

309
00:24:01.68 --> 00:24:06.32
Ottoman Empire is not, we're not talking about like England in the 1900s or something.

310
00:24:06.32 --> 00:24:11.92
It's a very sophisticated and advanced society in many ways, but you go like maybe 500 miles

311
00:24:11.92 --> 00:24:17.04
out to the east and it's a wild fricking west down there, you know, I mean it is like you got

312
00:24:17.04 --> 00:24:22.40
Armenian village surrounded by Kurdish tribes that raid that village sometimes in kidnapped your

313
00:24:22.40 --> 00:24:27.68
daughters and you know, you go outside the imperial corps and the Ottoman Empire did not have the

314
00:24:27.68 --> 00:24:32.96
state capacity to really exercise firm control over all of their lands. You know, it was a tribute

315
00:24:32.96 --> 00:24:37.04
empire which is again reminiscent of the old step empires, like we're not going to come in and tell

316
00:24:37.04 --> 00:24:42.32
you that you got a turn Turkish and you can't speak your language, just send your taxes and don't,

317
00:24:42.32 --> 00:24:47.12
you know, have any uprisings and if you do will come and you'll learn why the last 10 people

318
00:24:47.12 --> 00:24:53.60
found out that's a bad idea. Now that was really how it was. It was a tribute empire and the Christians

319
00:24:53.60 --> 00:24:58.96
and the Jews, Christians were more numerical than the Jews and so they really, and in the Ottoman

320
00:24:58.96 --> 00:25:04.16
context, when I say that we're talking mostly about Armenians and the East Greeks in the West

321
00:25:04.16 --> 00:25:10.000
and then a Syrians kind of spread out or a Syrian Christians as well. And by the time, a very similar

322
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:17.20
thing, they had been engaging in these middleman roles, right, administrative, professional and

323
00:25:17.20 --> 00:25:22.64
commercial services for the empire, stuff that the empire couldn't do in its own. Things like

324
00:25:22.64 --> 00:25:28.32
almost of the biggest mosques that East Endworld's famous for today were all designed by Armenians,

325
00:25:28.32 --> 00:25:33.84
Armenian architects. By the time you got up to the late 18 early 1900s, you've got the bureaucracy,

326
00:25:33.84 --> 00:25:39.04
largely filling the upper roles very often filled with, I shouldn't say, and the very, very upper roles,

327
00:25:39.04 --> 00:25:45.52
those are Ottoman rulers, but all of these sort of middlemanagement sort of GS14 roles, right?

328
00:25:45.52 --> 00:25:49.92
Those are Armenians, those are Greeks, you know, people like that. They really relied on these people.

329
00:25:50.48 --> 00:25:55.12
And it was a similar thing. You get up into the dawn of the modern age. We're having bureaucratic

330
00:25:55.12 --> 00:26:00.72
skills, being literate and numerate, knowing how to deal with finance and trade and law and medicine,

331
00:26:00.72 --> 00:26:04.48
all of these things that the Christians and the Ottoman Empire were doing. That's where you needed

332
00:26:04.48 --> 00:26:10.08
to be if you were going to be successful. And they became extraordinarily successful in the Ottoman Empire.

333
00:26:10.08 --> 00:26:15.92
Very, very wealthy. At one point, I mean, in fact, just before the outbreak of the first world war,

334
00:26:15.92 --> 00:26:20.96
the most, the wealthiest banker in Europe was an Ottoman Armenian. And we're wealthy, then,

335
00:26:20.96 --> 00:26:27.92
the Rothchild's even. And when you get to that point, you get, you run into that,

336
00:26:27.92 --> 00:26:35.52
into that trouble where you have this empire, where the ruling elites, the Turkish elites,

337
00:26:35.52 --> 00:26:42.16
are experiencing this sense that they aren't really needed so much anymore. Now, they don't

338
00:26:42.16 --> 00:26:45.52
feel that. They're not going to think that consciously ever, but that's really what's going on.

339
00:26:45.52 --> 00:26:50.000
They're in charge now of an empire that they couldn't have really built themselves. And they couldn't

340
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.96
really run themselves. And the people who are running it, they're starting to look at various skew

341
00:26:56.96 --> 00:27:03.04
for a very particular reason. And that was that this is also the age of European imperialism.

342
00:27:03.68 --> 00:27:07.28
You know, one of our unraveling episodes recently, we talked about the genocide of the Weagers.

343
00:27:07.28 --> 00:27:13.12
And you go back to the late 1800s. And the Weagers kind of became the dominant majority in

344
00:27:13.12 --> 00:27:18.24
Xinjiang. And that, I got annihilated for my mispronunciation of that word.

345
00:27:18.24 --> 00:27:20.56
But we'll have to do that in the United States. I must have got freedom.

346
00:27:20.56 --> 00:27:29.28
But what was I saying? I think you said Xinjiang, now I'm just messing with you. And

347
00:27:30.32 --> 00:27:34.32
the Weagers were in the territory. And they were being kind of oppressed by this dominant

348
00:27:34.32 --> 00:27:37.84
group there. And so the Xinjiang East said Roger that. And they went out and just wiped those

349
00:27:37.84 --> 00:27:43.52
people out. They were called the Zungars. And they don't exist anymore. And really one of the big

350
00:27:43.52 --> 00:27:49.20
drivers for that was, you know, we had talked about how in China, outside their borders. Well,

351
00:27:49.20 --> 00:27:52.40
what we think of as their borders today, they never thought about it as like a hard border

352
00:27:52.40 --> 00:27:56.48
back in the day. It was just that was the frontier. Past that is the step. That's where all

353
00:27:56.48 --> 00:28:00.72
the barbarians live. Yeah, their word for border literally meant like frontier. Yeah. Yeah.

354
00:28:00.72 --> 00:28:04.80
And so what they need to do is just they need to manage the barbarians out there.

355
00:28:05.36 --> 00:28:10.08
It's just one big buffer zone between us and them. Well, all of a sudden you start getting

356
00:28:10.08 --> 00:28:15.04
the British Empire, the French, later the Russian Empire, these other Europeans start coming

357
00:28:15.04 --> 00:28:20.96
around in any territory they see that's not already incorporated within the borders of a

358
00:28:20.96 --> 00:28:25.20
state that can actually defend it. They're snatching all that up. And so the Chinese say,

359
00:28:25.20 --> 00:28:30.96
well, okay, that's not just the frontier anymore. Now that's China. And anybody in it has to be

360
00:28:30.96 --> 00:28:36.16
Chinese because if you're anything but that, well, then you're somebody you're a wedge that

361
00:28:36.16 --> 00:28:41.36
the British, whoever might be able to come up and, you know, drive it with, yeah, bargain with.

362
00:28:41.36 --> 00:28:47.20
And so when these European powers start picking away at the periphery of the Ottoman Empire

363
00:28:47.20 --> 00:28:51.76
and then really start to close the walls in, and these Christian Europe, obviously,

364
00:28:52.56 --> 00:28:57.92
and they have a Christian minority population Greeks and Armenians and others who have not

365
00:28:57.92 --> 00:29:03.12
been treated particularly well over the years as a whole. And so they start to worry that these

366
00:29:03.12 --> 00:29:07.68
are potential fifth columnists that these European powers could use to start to split off more

367
00:29:07.68 --> 00:29:17.12
territory than they already have. So they've already got that in their heads. As we roll into world war

368
00:29:17.12 --> 00:29:21.92
one, is that, is that, you know, um, an appropriate thing? Is that appropriate assessment?

369
00:29:22.64 --> 00:29:26.88
Oh, yeah, oh, for sure. Yeah, and actually it existed before that. So when you go back to,

370
00:29:26.88 --> 00:29:30.96
you know, you think, I think you really have to put yourself in the mindset of the people

371
00:29:30.96 --> 00:29:35.04
running the Ottoman Empire and I think we can actually probably do that because we're Americans,

372
00:29:35.04 --> 00:29:42.000
right? And so you have to imagine, these are people who, again, had the largest and most powerful

373
00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.44
empire in the world for a number of years. I mean, they drove all the way up to Vienna twice.

374
00:29:47.44 --> 00:29:51.12
You go look at a map of Europe, everybody out there and I mean, if you know, it's not like

375
00:29:51.12 --> 00:29:55.44
there in the Balkans. It's up there in Central Europe. I mean, and if they would have, if they would have

376
00:29:55.44 --> 00:30:00.64
gotten past Vienna, I mean, you know, Germany was just broken into a bunch of little principalities at

377
00:30:00.64 --> 00:30:04.56
the time and they weren't standing up. Ottomans were on good terms with the French. I mean,

378
00:30:04.56 --> 00:30:08.96
they may have conquered like, you know, two thirds of Europe if they hadn't been stopped by the

379
00:30:08.96 --> 00:30:15.04
poles of Vienna. And so you have this empire that's not only the largest, most powerful empire

380
00:30:15.04 --> 00:30:20.88
in the world for centuries, it controls like its capital, is constant, the noble, the old Roman capital,

381
00:30:20.88 --> 00:30:26.72
you know, it controls access to the Black Sea, it has dominance over the entire eastern Mediterranean,

382
00:30:26.72 --> 00:30:33.04
controls access between the east and west, you know, trade routes, and then all of a sudden,

383
00:30:33.04 --> 00:30:38.000
you know, starting kind of, really after that 1683 fight at Vienna that they lost, it was just a

384
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.36
gradual and then accelerating downhill slide from there. They lose, they start getting shipped away

385
00:30:43.36 --> 00:30:48.24
in North Africa, eventually they lose all that. They lose Egypt. The Russian empire finally

386
00:30:48.24 --> 00:30:53.04
starts to get its act together, takes over all of the North Caucasus and wars there. The Russians

387
00:30:53.04 --> 00:30:58.40
are expanding, you know, you have Orthodox Christians in the Balkans, the Russian empire is pushing

388
00:30:58.40 --> 00:31:05.36
down there. They lose their Balkan territories over time. They lose Bulgaria. And so you have this empire

389
00:31:05.36 --> 00:31:11.04
that is, you know, you have to imagine being an American and it's like, yeah, Vietnam was tough,

390
00:31:11.04 --> 00:31:17.60
Iraq and Afghanistan were tough. Oh, no Mexico just invaded and took over New Mexico Arizona and

391
00:31:17.60 --> 00:31:23.04
Southern California and there's nothing we can do about it. And now Cuba took over Florida and

392
00:31:23.04 --> 00:31:28.24
there's nothing we can do about it. Like, that's lost, it's gone now. And there's this

393
00:31:28.24 --> 00:31:33.60
growing sense that it's not going to reverse any time soon, if ever, that this is like an

394
00:31:33.60 --> 00:31:41.28
inexorable process of collapse that's going on. And because it's being done by these European

395
00:31:41.28 --> 00:31:46.88
imperialists of the ones chipping away at a Christian Europe and because of the fact that their

396
00:31:46.88 --> 00:31:57.84
own Christian minorities had been mistreated for centuries, the, you know, there was this sort of

397
00:31:57.84 --> 00:32:01.60
sense of hope among some of those Christian minorities that may be, hey, you know, where the

398
00:32:01.60 --> 00:32:06.24
Armenians over here in the East, it's not great to be an Eastern and Ottoman Armenian out in the

399
00:32:06.24 --> 00:32:10.56
rural areas in the East. The Russian empire, their Orthodox Christians, there's a bunch of

400
00:32:10.56 --> 00:32:13.60
Armenians that live over in the Russian empire and they're actually doing all right. They're not

401
00:32:13.60 --> 00:32:18.48
getting massacred by the tens of thousands. They're not having to pay taxes to, you know, the

402
00:32:18.48 --> 00:32:24.48
eight Kurdish chiefdans that all live around us. And so there was some of this, you know, these

403
00:32:24.48 --> 00:32:28.64
people weren't organized fifth columnists or anything like that. But there was this sort of sense

404
00:32:28.64 --> 00:32:32.40
that things might be a little bit better if they weren't living under the Ottoman Yoke. That wasn't,

405
00:32:32.40 --> 00:32:40.96
you know, completely invented. When after the 1877 war between the Russians and the Turks,

406
00:32:41.36 --> 00:32:46.32
they lost Bulgaria, a bunch of Muslim refugees came out of Bulgaria and came and moved into the

407
00:32:46.32 --> 00:32:51.20
Ottoman Empire. They also lost a bunch of their North Caucasian territory and a bunch of Strakasi

408
00:32:51.20 --> 00:32:56.96
and Muslims and other Muslim tribes from up there had to be pushed, you know, they, they, they,

409
00:32:56.96 --> 00:33:00.40
they fled because the classics were harassing them and stuff. And so they start coming down

410
00:33:00.40 --> 00:33:04.80
in a lot of them settled in this area where Armenians had traditionally lived. The whole

411
00:33:04.80 --> 00:33:10.32
area of South Eastern Turkey today, you know, Armenia is right across the Eastern border, but

412
00:33:10.32 --> 00:33:14.000
you go across the border, that whole area of South Eastern Turkey where it's mostly Kurds today.

413
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:18.32
That, that for many, many centuries was all Armenians for the most part. That's traditional like

414
00:33:18.32 --> 00:33:24.96
Armenia. And, um, yet all of these others that moved into this territory and they started having

415
00:33:24.96 --> 00:33:29.44
problems with the local Armenian population. Right at this time where the Turkish government is

416
00:33:29.44 --> 00:33:33.36
starting to look at its Christian minorities and specifically the Armenians with a great deal of

417
00:33:33.36 --> 00:33:42.000
suspicion. And so, you start to get, you know, you start to get this dynamic where, you know,

418
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.12
there's multiple things that play. They don't trust the Armenian population out there and they're

419
00:33:47.12 --> 00:33:51.36
mistreating them, which is leading to a certain sense of resentment from those Armenians toward the

420
00:33:51.36 --> 00:33:56.72
government. The government doesn't have the state capacity to go out there and really like

421
00:33:56.72 --> 00:34:01.84
set up shop and establish order out there. You have all of these destitute new Muslim refugees,

422
00:34:01.84 --> 00:34:07.04
including a lot of them are just tribes or Kurdish tribes and things, no mads who, again,

423
00:34:07.04 --> 00:34:11.52
their refugees, they don't have a lot going on. And so they start robbing and raiding the Armenian

424
00:34:11.52 --> 00:34:16.72
settlements that are out there. And the Turkish government either lacks the will or the capacity

425
00:34:16.72 --> 00:34:22.24
to defend them or to go out and punish them. And so Armenian self defense movement start to basically

426
00:34:22.24 --> 00:34:26.96
pop up just so they can defend themselves from these Kurdish raids and Circassian raids.

427
00:34:26.96 --> 00:34:31.52
Well, the Turkish government sees that. They say, you see, they're arming up. They just kill

428
00:34:31.52 --> 00:34:36.24
the bunch of Muslims from that Kurdish tribe over there. We knew it. We knew they're getting ready for

429
00:34:36.24 --> 00:34:42.24
rebellion. And it was just this vicious cycle that started to kick into place to the point where

430
00:34:42.24 --> 00:34:46.64
by the time you get to the 1880s, 1890s, you mentioned that song at the beginning that the Turkish

431
00:34:46.64 --> 00:34:51.20
schoolchildren who being taught during the First World War. There was an account I read from an

432
00:34:51.20 --> 00:34:56.56
American missionary that saw in a Turkish classroom, talking like, first, second, third grade kids.

433
00:34:57.12 --> 00:35:03.52
And they're going through lessons where they've got drawings up on the board, like cartoon drawings

434
00:35:03.52 --> 00:35:09.92
of Armenians, including women and children participating, just hacking limbs off of Turks and

435
00:35:09.92 --> 00:35:14.000
you know, raping them, killing them and just the most bloody and horrible ways and these

436
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.40
schoolchildren who being taught that this is who these Armenians are. This is what they want to do to you.

437
00:35:19.68 --> 00:35:23.20
And so this had been by the time you get to the First World War, this kind of thing had been going

438
00:35:23.20 --> 00:35:30.80
on for decades. And the Armenians didn't have, you know, it didn't come to them as a complete

439
00:35:30.80 --> 00:35:35.76
and total shock, a lot of them anyway, because they had seen a sort of premonition of it in the

440
00:35:35.76 --> 00:35:45.36
1890s when the Sultan Abdul Hamid II infamous in Ottoman and Armenian history, ordered a series of

441
00:35:45.36 --> 00:35:53.84
massacres starting in 1894 that, you know, what can you say? It was just a, it was a free-for-all

442
00:35:53.84 --> 00:35:59.20
total massacre. You know, there were soldiers in John Darm, John Darm's who were participating,

443
00:35:59.20 --> 00:36:05.04
but really it was a call on the local populations, Muslim villagers and tribes to get out there

444
00:36:05.04 --> 00:36:09.76
and participate, kill your Armenian neighbors. And they, and they was specific to the Armenians.

445
00:36:09.76 --> 00:36:13.60
There were some cases in fact, and this happened as well in the First World War genocide,

446
00:36:14.80 --> 00:36:18.80
where there are telegrams out there, messages from the government letting them know,

447
00:36:18.80 --> 00:36:23.28
hey, don't mess with the Catholics, make sure that you don't mess with, you know, these others,

448
00:36:23.28 --> 00:36:30.24
this is about the Armenians. And they butcher maybe 200,000 people over the course of about

449
00:36:30.24 --> 00:36:37.52
18 months, and another 100,000 or so died in the years. So after that from starvation and exposure

450
00:36:37.52 --> 00:36:41.04
and whatever. And so this is something where, you know, they're not going into cities and rounding up

451
00:36:41.04 --> 00:36:45.68
20, 30,000 people at a time. They're going village to village to village 50 people here. 100 people

452
00:36:45.68 --> 00:36:52.24
here. You look at the map of the massacres in the 1894, a million massacres. And the whole thing is

453
00:36:52.24 --> 00:36:56.32
just covered with like skulls and cross bones or whatever symbol they used to say, massacres,

454
00:36:56.32 --> 00:37:03.28
massacres, massacres, just all of eastern Anatolia was just in covered in blood. You know,

455
00:37:03.28 --> 00:37:08.32
the local population was basically mobilized to go out there and kill your Armenian neighbors.

456
00:37:08.32 --> 00:37:15.76
And that's what happened. So that's 18 late 1800s. And now we start to get into, I mean,

457
00:37:15.76 --> 00:37:21.84
it's the next major phase when World War One kicks off. And yeah, there's an important

458
00:37:21.84 --> 00:37:25.92
interlude there. Like the reason that they stopped killing them. You know, there's a book that

459
00:37:25.92 --> 00:37:30.64
came out recently called the 30-year genocide by Benny Morris and George Zevy, which is

460
00:37:31.52 --> 00:37:36.08
two Israeli historians who looked real deeply on this and got. They probably went deeper into the

461
00:37:36.08 --> 00:37:42.000
into the records to figure out exactly moment by moment like what happened here than anyone really

462
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.16
has. And one of the things that they discovered is that, you know, this was not something that just

463
00:37:46.16 --> 00:37:52.96
popped up in the chaos of World War One. That those massacres in the 1890s, there's only one

464
00:37:52.96 --> 00:37:58.64
reason that they stopped. And that was that the British made them stop. There was, there was,

465
00:37:58.64 --> 00:38:02.56
you know, by this point, the Ottoman Empire was having huge economic problems. The British and the

466
00:38:02.56 --> 00:38:07.04
French were essentially had the Empire's finances and receivership. They were basically controlling the

467
00:38:07.04 --> 00:38:14.08
Ottoman fiscal budget, the governmental fiscal budget, had, you know, say so over it anyway. And

468
00:38:15.68 --> 00:38:22.24
in 1896, this Armenian militant group, after all of these murders said, we have to do something.

469
00:38:22.24 --> 00:38:26.32
And there's nothing you can really do. I mean, you know, you can't, you're talking about,

470
00:38:26.32 --> 00:38:30.56
it's not even David and Goliath. I mean, it's a flee versus Goliath. They can't fight back. There's

471
00:38:30.56 --> 00:38:34.40
nothing like that. The only thing they can hope to do is get the attention of outside powers

472
00:38:34.40 --> 00:38:38.96
who can wield influence over the Ottoman Empire. And so they say, well, what is it we can do to

473
00:38:38.96 --> 00:38:42.24
actually get the attention of these people? What are they? What are the British care about?

474
00:38:42.80 --> 00:38:48.08
And so they went and they invaded the Ottoman Central Bank, the Bank Ottoman in Constantinople,

475
00:38:48.08 --> 00:38:56.24
and they took a bunch of hostages and made a bunch of demands. And they knew that there were a lot

476
00:38:56.24 --> 00:39:02.40
of European hostages that they would be taking and that there were a lot of European assets in that

477
00:39:02.40 --> 00:39:09.44
bank. And so the Sultan at the time, he's, you know, again, these are these are step warriors. He's

478
00:39:09.44 --> 00:39:13.36
a hardcore people. He said, yeah, that's nice. Your demands, that's cool. You can throw them away.

479
00:39:13.36 --> 00:39:17.36
And he just surrounded the place with artillery and got ready to just blow the place to rub

480
00:39:17.36 --> 00:39:22.40
up all and at the same time put out an order for everybody to enconstant an opal to just go

481
00:39:22.40 --> 00:39:25.92
out and mask her Armenians and Constantinople. And that's what they did. They rampaged through

482
00:39:25.92 --> 00:39:30.72
streets, beating, killing. Anybody they could find has he prepared to just blow up this bank.

483
00:39:31.60 --> 00:39:36.000
And ready to the critical moment, the British sent some warships into the Dardenels there

484
00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.20
and sent a message to the Sultan that if you blow up that bank, the next thing it's going to

485
00:39:39.20 --> 00:39:44.32
be destroyed as your own house. And so they backed down, but that's the only reason those things

486
00:39:44.32 --> 00:39:50.08
stopped and he put an order out that the maskers are over and they came to an end. That period,

487
00:39:50.08 --> 00:39:54.000
though, up until you get to the first World War, most, you know, people who look at this seriously

488
00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.88
now realize that the first World War was not a reason for the Armenian genocide. It was just

489
00:40:00.88 --> 00:40:10.32
the opportunity for it. This some late 1890s, there's actually, you know, we can talk about what

490
00:40:10.32 --> 00:40:13.76
it was like. We can sort of throw some words on it, but there's probably nothing better than

491
00:40:13.76 --> 00:40:21.44
going back to the book that we're talking about, Armenian gogaatha, talking about some of that stuff

492
00:40:21.44 --> 00:40:29.36
that took place in the 1890s, going back to the book. The massacre began on the morning of December

493
00:40:29.36 --> 00:40:35.60
28. The governor sent word to non-Armenian Christians to assemble in their churches and not

494
00:40:35.60 --> 00:40:42.96
stir out and refrain from sheltering Armenians. The troops were then drawn up at the entrances

495
00:40:42.96 --> 00:40:50.08
to the Armenian quarter. Behind them, an armed Muslim mob gathered, while the Minorets were crowded

496
00:40:50.08 --> 00:40:57.20
with Muslims evidently in expectation of some stirring event. The Turkish women too crowded

497
00:40:57.20 --> 00:41:02.32
onto the roofs and slopes of the fortress which overlooked the Armenian quarter. The mob was

498
00:41:02.32 --> 00:41:09.12
cheered on by the women who kept up the well-known peculiar throat noise used on such occasions

499
00:41:09.12 --> 00:41:20.16
by Oriental women to discourage, to encourage their braves. At around noon, a mousin cried out

500
00:41:20.88 --> 00:41:26.64
in the midday prayer as a glittering glass ornament resembling a crescent was seen shining

501
00:41:26.64 --> 00:41:31.92
from the top of the fortress overlooking the town, a mullah wave, degreen banner from a tall

502
00:41:31.92 --> 00:41:41.36
minaret overhanging the other end of town, shots were fired and a trumpet sounded the attack.

503
00:41:41.36 --> 00:41:46.56
The soldiers opened their ranks so that the mob could pour into the quarter.

504
00:41:47.28 --> 00:41:54.88
The governor, Nazif, was seen motioning the crowd on. The mob guided by troops who had familiarized

505
00:41:54.88 --> 00:42:04.08
themselves with the quarter during the siege. A body of wood cutters armed with axes led the way,

506
00:42:04.08 --> 00:42:13.60
breaking down the doors, soldiers then rushed inside and shot the men. A certain chic British

507
00:42:13.60 --> 00:42:21.12
diplomat, G. H. Fitz Morris wrote, ordered his followers to bring as many stalwart young

508
00:42:21.12 --> 00:42:26.72
Armenians as they could find to their number of about 100 they were thrown down on their backs

509
00:42:26.72 --> 00:42:34.24
and held down by their hands and feet while the shake with a combination of fanaticism, cruelty,

510
00:42:34.24 --> 00:42:42.000
proceeded while reciting verses of the Quran to cut their throats after the mecharite of

511
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:53.76
sacrificing sheep. Those hiding were dragged out and butchered, stoned, shot and set on fire with

512
00:42:53.76 --> 00:43:01.52
madding saturated with petroleum. Women were cut down shielding their husbands and fathers,

513
00:43:01.52 --> 00:43:06.96
more Armenians were shot as they scampered along rooftops trying to escape when the killings

514
00:43:06.96 --> 00:43:15.68
subsided. The houses were looted and torched. As Sunset approached, the trumpet sounded again,

515
00:43:15.68 --> 00:43:23.12
calling the troops and the mob to withdraw. The atrocities resumed the following day December

516
00:43:23.12 --> 00:43:29.36
29 with a trumpet sound that dawn. The largest number were killed at the Armenian Cathedral,

517
00:43:29.36 --> 00:43:34.56
where thousands had gathered for sanctuary. The attackers first fired through the windows into

518
00:43:34.56 --> 00:43:38.96
the church, then smashed in the doors and killed the men clustered on the ground floor.

519
00:43:40.08 --> 00:43:46.08
Fits Morris relates that as the mob plunged the church, they mockingly called on Christ to prove

520
00:43:46.08 --> 00:43:54.64
himself a greater profit than Mohamed. The Turks then shot the shrieking and terrified massive

521
00:43:54.64 --> 00:44:00.40
women children and some men in the second floor gallery. But gunning the Armenians down,

522
00:44:00.40 --> 00:44:05.92
one by one was too tedious, so the mob brought in more petroleum soaked bedding and set

523
00:44:05.92 --> 00:44:10.72
fired to the woodwork and the staircase is leading up to the galleries. For several hours,

524
00:44:10.72 --> 00:44:14.40
the sickening odor of roasting flesh pervaded the town.

525
00:44:17.44 --> 00:44:21.68
Writing the following march, Fits Morris noted, even today,

526
00:44:23.28 --> 00:44:26.72
the smell of the charred remains in the church is unbearable.

527
00:44:26.72 --> 00:44:35.20
The missionary who witnessed a massacre's described the horror as a grand holocaust,

528
00:44:35.20 --> 00:44:42.000
and for days afterwards watched men lugging sacks filled with bones and ashes from the cathedral.

529
00:44:44.96 --> 00:44:50.64
The trumpet again sounded at 330 pm the time for the Muslim afternoon prayer and the mob

530
00:44:50.64 --> 00:44:56.96
with Jew from the Armenian quarter. Shortly afterwards, Mert Fits Morris wrote,

531
00:44:56.96 --> 00:45:04.24
the muffti, Ali Effendi, who sang Pasha and other notables preceded by a band of musicians

532
00:45:04.24 --> 00:45:09.92
went around the quarter announcing that the massacre was at an end and that there would be no

533
00:45:09.92 --> 00:45:18.48
more killing of Christians. For the next three days, the authorities employed Jews and Donkeys

534
00:45:18.48 --> 00:45:25.68
to remove the dead before the massacre's erphra was home to about 20,000 Armenians.

535
00:45:27.76 --> 00:45:31.68
All told, perhaps as many as 10,000 died over the course of two days,

536
00:45:33.04 --> 00:45:36.64
2500 to 3000 of them at the cathedral.

537
00:45:36.64 --> 00:45:49.44
This was no shock or moving into World War I.

538
00:45:49.44 --> 00:45:57.68
Although, there's maybe a way that nothing can prepare you for it, even if you've seen it

539
00:45:57.68 --> 00:46:03.20
come in when it happens. You're just not ready. There were a lot of Jews in Europe in the 1930s

540
00:46:03.20 --> 00:46:08.24
who were writing to their relatives and other parts of the world sang. We got to get out of here.

541
00:46:08.24 --> 00:46:13.52
We're sitting on the edge of a volcano right now. Who still, when it actually came,

542
00:46:14.64 --> 00:46:19.04
we're all just caught with that deer and a headlight look because what do you do?

543
00:46:19.04 --> 00:46:25.68
There's a lot of you can read a lot of stuff from Holocaust survivors, children, and also from

544
00:46:25.68 --> 00:46:29.92
Zionists who were in Palestine out of the country at the time who really can't understand why

545
00:46:29.92 --> 00:46:34.48
our parents or our cousins who were in Europe at the time, why aren't they fighting back? Why aren't

546
00:46:34.48 --> 00:46:38.48
they rising up or whatever? You just don't know what it's like to be caught.

547
00:46:39.52 --> 00:46:45.60
Where there's nowhere to go, the enemies in control, and there is, you can rush the electrified

548
00:46:45.60 --> 00:46:50.40
fence, you can, you're caught, and they've established dominance in a way that you're not going

549
00:46:50.40 --> 00:46:56.56
to really be able to get out of because again, these modern scale genocides like this are

550
00:46:56.56 --> 00:47:02.64
something that could really only be pulled off by a state. How the young Turks play into this?

551
00:47:02.64 --> 00:47:09.04
So after you know, there were people within the Turkish hierarchy who understood that this

552
00:47:09.84 --> 00:47:13.52
that this empire as it stands right now, it's got to change.

553
00:47:13.52 --> 00:47:15.20
Got to make a transition to have to.

554
00:47:15.20 --> 00:47:20.80
Let's learn it. If we're going to compete at any level with the British Empire, the rising

555
00:47:20.80 --> 00:47:24.64
Russian Empire, like we got to get it together, and the way we're running things now,

556
00:47:24.64 --> 00:47:28.96
or we can't even really control our territory effectively a few hundred miles out east,

557
00:47:28.96 --> 00:47:31.36
that's just not going to do it. It's not going to do it anymore.

558
00:47:32.64 --> 00:47:36.08
And so they were modernizers. This was a movement that started out in universities,

559
00:47:36.08 --> 00:47:40.64
a lot of medical students, lost students, things like that, and it was an underground group.

560
00:47:40.64 --> 00:47:44.80
It was sort of a revolutionary group, sort of like you were seeing all across Europe at the time,

561
00:47:44.80 --> 00:47:47.84
you know, the Bolsheviks and a lot of the socialists in Russia, for example.

562
00:47:49.84 --> 00:47:53.04
The difference I guess between like them and the Bolsheviks, there's a million differences,

563
00:47:53.04 --> 00:47:56.72
but the main one is they weren't international communist or anything. They were fierce,

564
00:47:57.36 --> 00:48:04.08
fierce Turkish nationalists. But they were, they were multi-cultural. This was a big difference, too.

565
00:48:04.08 --> 00:48:09.28
This wasn't strictly Armenians or Greeks inside of these were people saying,

566
00:48:09.28 --> 00:48:14.64
it's like when you hear today, you know, like I'm not a Irish American, I'm an American.

567
00:48:14.64 --> 00:48:19.36
Right. These people are saying, hey, I'm not an Armenian Turk, or I'm not a Jewish Turk. I'm Turk.

568
00:48:19.36 --> 00:48:23.84
Yeah. So they actually had, but they called the Ottomanist movement.

569
00:48:23.84 --> 00:48:27.60
You know, they were, they wanted everybody. This is a big thing in the late 1800s,

570
00:48:27.60 --> 00:48:34.24
really up until the defeat in the First World War that that everywhere were all Ottomans, right?

571
00:48:34.24 --> 00:48:39.68
Which at the time was like Ottoman, that's just the name of the Turkish commander who came in with

572
00:48:39.68 --> 00:48:42.88
that, you know, he was established their tribe. I mean, he was the tribal leader at the time,

573
00:48:42.88 --> 00:48:47.20
all S'mon. But, you know, by the time you got up to this point, I mean, America's

574
00:48:47.20 --> 00:48:51.68
some of the Italian sailors too, right? So like you can do that, no problem. But there was the ideas

575
00:48:51.68 --> 00:48:55.92
that we're all Ottomans here. Doesn't matter where you were born. Whatever. In fact, a lot of the

576
00:48:55.92 --> 00:48:59.92
young Turk and committee of Union and Progress, which was like a really militant group,

577
00:49:00.64 --> 00:49:05.04
subgroup of the young Turks. Some of their leaders, including some of the ones that would be in charge

578
00:49:05.04 --> 00:49:10.80
of the empire during the First World War, they weren't Turkish. Tullot Pasha of the guy was the

579
00:49:10.80 --> 00:49:16.40
interior minister and the effect of head of government for the Ottoman Empire was from Bulgaria, for

580
00:49:16.40 --> 00:49:21.36
example. In the young Turks, they had Jews, they had Armenians. The Armenians, in fact, really

581
00:49:21.36 --> 00:49:26.08
supported the young Turks at first because they thought we have this force that's maybe more

582
00:49:26.56 --> 00:49:32.24
trying to be modernizing influence seems like more of a secular influence because that was one

583
00:49:32.24 --> 00:49:38.24
other thing I didn't mention is as you as the Ottoman Empire started to get worried about these

584
00:49:38.24 --> 00:49:43.04
Christians to size European societies pushing up on their borders and maybe using their interior

585
00:49:43.04 --> 00:49:48.56
internal Christians as fifth columnists let's create some divide. They really started pushing

586
00:49:48.56 --> 00:49:52.96
that Islamic identity and really playing that angle of it up, which was something they kind of avoided

587
00:49:52.96 --> 00:49:57.44
before for the most part. Obviously, like the Ottoman Empire is the caliphate, right? The Sultan is the

588
00:49:57.44 --> 00:50:02.80
caliph. And so they're in charge, you're in somebody else's house, right? If you're a Christian

589
00:50:02.80 --> 00:50:08.000
or a Jew, this is the Muslims house and everybody knew that, but they really, they had an empire

590
00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.56
to manage. They weren't trying to create problems between their Muslim and Christian and Jewish subjects,

591
00:50:13.76 --> 00:50:18.32
by the time when it once they started worrying about the loyalty of these Christian subjects

592
00:50:18.32 --> 00:50:23.28
and worrying not only about that actually worrying about their non-Turkish imperial subjects,

593
00:50:23.28 --> 00:50:28.24
like they were worried about the Arabs not wanting to be under Turkish rule and as we saw in World War

594
00:50:28.24 --> 00:50:32.16
one that was probably a good call. They saw the British sent Lawrence of Arabia down there and got

595
00:50:32.16 --> 00:50:37.92
the Arabs to rise up and march on on the Ottoman Empire. And so they wanted to avoid

596
00:50:37.92 --> 00:50:42.80
that. And so they started playing up to the Arabs, it's your Muslims. This is a Muslim empire. How

597
00:50:42.80 --> 00:50:47.84
could you side with the British? They would say to the Kurds, you know, that you had the Russian

598
00:50:47.84 --> 00:50:51.92
empire who was trying to encourage Kurdish separatism, for example, just to kind of create some

599
00:50:51.92 --> 00:50:56.16
chaos and some problems over there. And they wanted them to say, hey, your Muslims, don't you see

600
00:50:56.16 --> 00:51:02.96
those Christians or just want to destroy this glorious Muslim empire? That's side effect of that,

601
00:51:02.96 --> 00:51:07.36
or maybe it wasn't a side effect. Because they were worried about their loyalty of these internal

602
00:51:07.36 --> 00:51:11.84
Christians as well, was that those Kurds? Yeah, we are Muslim. And these Christians are trying

603
00:51:11.84 --> 00:51:17.76
to destroy this glorious Muslim empire. Those Armenians are Christian and you started to get some

604
00:51:17.76 --> 00:51:21.36
real problems there. And when you couple that with what they were teaching in classrooms and stuff,

605
00:51:21.36 --> 00:51:26.32
by the time you get up to, you know, the first world war, it's at a fever pitch. Well,

606
00:51:27.04 --> 00:51:32.40
the young Turks, they seemed to be a force and to some degree they were a force that was trying to

607
00:51:32.40 --> 00:51:38.16
move the empire beyond all that. And so you have these Armenians, including like Armenian militant

608
00:51:38.16 --> 00:51:43.68
groups, you know, that it really formed up because they, because of the mistreatment of the Armenians

609
00:51:43.68 --> 00:51:49.44
in the East, who are down with the young Turks, the fully supported him in 1908 when the young Turks

610
00:51:49.44 --> 00:51:53.92
launch a coup to, you know, take over the government. They march on Constantinople, take over the

611
00:51:53.92 --> 00:51:58.96
government. Armenians were cheering in the streets. The Armenian militant groups were celebrating that.

612
00:51:58.96 --> 00:52:05.60
In 1909, a year later there was a counter coup by the conservative Sultan forces, the

613
00:52:05.60 --> 00:52:10.72
Sultan's forces. And during that brief period that the Sultan was back in power and the young

614
00:52:10.72 --> 00:52:15.44
Turks were out of power, another 30,000 Armenians got massacred in the province of Adana.

615
00:52:15.44 --> 00:52:21.52
And it was done with the same character that you just read. You know, this is a, again, this is

616
00:52:21.52 --> 00:52:27.04
the first world war in that whole period is, it's so fascinating, right? Because it's this war

617
00:52:27.04 --> 00:52:34.08
in which the old world marched into those trenches and the new world marched out of them,

618
00:52:34.08 --> 00:52:39.92
you know, it's the pre-modern world and then the modern world just really it's that transition point

619
00:52:39.92 --> 00:52:44.96
in that clash. And so you have this genocide that is done for modern reasons, like national

620
00:52:44.96 --> 00:52:50.08
reasons almost, right? You didn't, you know, this idea of like ethnic purity and needing to have

621
00:52:50.08 --> 00:52:55.60
like our internal period, that's a modernist idea. And the, the means by which it was carried out

622
00:52:55.60 --> 00:52:59.68
administratively and all of these things, the Turkish Empire was a modern empire many ways.

623
00:53:00.64 --> 00:53:07.84
But this is genocide that was not carried out, you know, with with ledger sheets and, you know,

624
00:53:08.56 --> 00:53:12.88
Zyklan B and, and gas ovens or anything like that. This was something that was done the old way.

625
00:53:13.44 --> 00:53:21.84
It was done with hatchets and axes and hand knives and kitchen knives and clubs and boots.

626
00:53:21.84 --> 00:53:29.28
And it was something that, you know, it was a genocide that was conducted in ravines just off the road

627
00:53:29.28 --> 00:53:38.24
and in people's basements, not on battlefields. So the situation that we're looking at,

628
00:53:39.20 --> 00:53:45.60
now now we get ready for World War One. And the, is it a Hillary Clinton quote,

629
00:53:45.60 --> 00:53:51.68
Never let a crisis go to waste. That was, that was Rama manual. Yeah, okay. President Obama's first

630
00:53:51.68 --> 00:53:56.88
chief of staff. Never let a crisis go to waste. Yeah. It's a new quote, but it's not a new idea at all.

631
00:53:57.52 --> 00:54:03.20
And so World War One breaks out. Yeah. And this is an opportunity. And they get started right away.

632
00:54:04.08 --> 00:54:08.40
And some people who may have been paying attention at the time, they may have had some idea that

633
00:54:08.40 --> 00:54:13.28
the young Turks had changed a little because they took the government back over pretty quickly in 1909.

634
00:54:13.28 --> 00:54:17.68
So the young Turks are in charge now. And a lot of the Armenians feel pretty good about that.

635
00:54:18.32 --> 00:54:22.88
At least relative to what they had been facing before. But in 1910,

636
00:54:23.44 --> 00:54:26.96
there was this incident. People were complaining about all of these stray dogs running around

637
00:54:26.96 --> 00:54:31.28
Constantinople. Tens of thousands of them that were just running around. They were attacking people

638
00:54:31.28 --> 00:54:35.52
sometimes destroying the city. And the young Turk government was called on to fix this problem.

639
00:54:35.52 --> 00:54:40.32
How are you going to fix it? Well, they sent dog catchers, thousands of dog catchers out. And they

640
00:54:40.32 --> 00:54:47.04
caught all of these dogs one by one. It's about 80,000 dogs they caught. And they put them in cages.

641
00:54:47.04 --> 00:54:50.48
And they took them all out to this island, right off the coast, in the Dardenells.

642
00:54:51.20 --> 00:54:56.80
And they just dropped them off there. And the medium size ones ate the small ones.

643
00:54:56.80 --> 00:55:01.84
The big ones ate the medium size ones. The mean ones ate the big ones. And then the mean ones

644
00:55:01.84 --> 00:55:06.32
died of starvation. And that's how they dealt with the dogs in Constantinople.

645
00:55:06.32 --> 00:55:14.64
The young Turks were this force that was supposed to be fixing all of these old legacy

646
00:55:14.64 --> 00:55:19.12
problems of the empire. Well, they had a chance to prove it in 1912 and 1913, just the year before

647
00:55:19.12 --> 00:55:23.28
the first World War Breaks out. You had the serves and the Montenegroans and a coalition of

648
00:55:23.28 --> 00:55:29.52
other small Balkan Slavic peoples up there who revolted against the empire. And the young Turks

649
00:55:29.52 --> 00:55:34.96
sent an army up there and they got pushed back. And the young Turks were humiliated by this.

650
00:55:34.96 --> 00:55:41.36
They lost the last of their European territories in the Balkans by doing that. And they blamed,

651
00:55:41.36 --> 00:55:46.80
very, and they very much blamed sort of fifth columnist Christians in those Balkan territories for

652
00:55:46.80 --> 00:55:51.52
what had happened. And right around this time, you start to see the forces within the young

653
00:55:51.52 --> 00:55:56.80
Turk movement that is very anti-Christian and specifically anti-Rominian. Because they're

654
00:55:56.80 --> 00:56:00.56
the ones that they really worry about. The Greeks are a separate issue. We'll talk about them a

655
00:56:00.56 --> 00:56:05.76
little bit. But you can say killed 300,000 Greeks right around this period too. They killed 300,000

656
00:56:05.76 --> 00:56:10.56
a Syrian Christians. They killed a couple hundred thousand Lebanese Christians. This was a, this was a

657
00:56:10.56 --> 00:56:14.72
mass killing of all Christians across the empire. They just really had it in for the Armenians in

658
00:56:14.72 --> 00:56:20.80
particular. And so the first World War Breaks out and, you know, again, I mentioned this like

659
00:56:20.80 --> 00:56:24.40
very near the beginning, you have the Armenians who recognize that like this could be a problem.

660
00:56:24.40 --> 00:56:28.64
Like this is going to be an issue for us not necessarily that they're going to do something

661
00:56:28.64 --> 00:56:32.64
like genocide us because nobody was thinking like that at the time. You know, you have to remember

662
00:56:32.64 --> 00:56:38.48
like nobody had, this was a pre-Holokos, this was pre-Polpot, this is pre-stalin or any of that kind

663
00:56:38.48 --> 00:56:43.60
of stuff. Like the idea that you would have one of these major empires. And the Ottoman Empire

664
00:56:43.60 --> 00:56:49.60
like to us maybe, you know, we think of it as like this very sort of exotic foreign empire that's

665
00:56:49.60 --> 00:56:54.24
almost this, this throwback from like an ancient time or something like that and very orient.

666
00:56:54.24 --> 00:56:59.36
I mean, this was the Europeans, you know, they had, they were fully integrated with,

667
00:56:59.36 --> 00:57:03.28
with Europe for the most part. I mean, this was something that people read about,

668
00:57:03.28 --> 00:57:07.92
Constantinople in the New York Times every day. You know, this was, people talk about like,

669
00:57:07.92 --> 00:57:11.76
you know, Germany, how one of the crazy things about the Holocaust is like,

670
00:57:11.76 --> 00:57:15.28
but it's Germany, how could Germany do something like that? You know, this is,

671
00:57:15.28 --> 00:57:20.24
we're leaving it's came from, it's way to, and a girth that came from. And, you know, the Turks were

672
00:57:20.24 --> 00:57:25.20
not as foreign, the Ottoman Empire rather was not as foreign back then as we probably

673
00:57:25.20 --> 00:57:29.44
tend to otherwise it and think about it today. And so nobody was thinking like they're going to

674
00:57:29.44 --> 00:57:34.48
wipe us all out. Yeah, there might be massacres that local populations might get out of control

675
00:57:34.48 --> 00:57:39.52
on the local government there might encourage them or or not stop them from doing it. But nobody

676
00:57:39.52 --> 00:57:44.24
was quite thinking along such totalizing lines because they just didn't have a historical

677
00:57:44.24 --> 00:57:50.000
precedent for it. Yeah, the, um, that idea that you talked about earlier of sitting there thinking,

678
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:56.32
well, you know, this isn't going to happen. Right. How can this happen? Well, even as it was happening,

679
00:57:56.32 --> 00:58:02.72
even as it was happening and it was definitely happening. Let's hear a little bit about what happened,

680
00:58:02.72 --> 00:58:11.04
going back to the book. During the first days falling my arrival in Constantinople,

681
00:58:11.04 --> 00:58:15.84
I hastened to call on several notables who might had known for a long time and who were friends

682
00:58:15.84 --> 00:58:21.92
of mine. My general impression was this, no one grasped the gravity of the situation and no one

683
00:58:21.92 --> 00:58:27.28
was worried about tomorrow. Many insisted that Turkey would not enter the war when it began. They

684
00:58:27.28 --> 00:58:32.96
said the mobilization was simply a precaution. They were simple minded people convinced that as

685
00:58:32.96 --> 00:58:40.08
long as the government was in the hands of the young Turks. And Talaat was the interior minister,

686
00:58:40.08 --> 00:58:47.92
no danger faced them. But alas, the Armenian leaders came to understand the truth,

687
00:58:49.28 --> 00:58:57.52
only when they were already walking on the road to death. So deceived where they by the

688
00:58:57.52 --> 00:59:03.76
flattery of promises lavished upon them that would achieve a police and several policemen came to

689
00:59:03.76 --> 00:59:11.12
find Anaguni, one of the dashnack party leaders and a brilliant Russian Armenian writer and placed

690
00:59:11.12 --> 00:59:18.000
him under arrest. The superfied Anaguni, am I saying that right? Anaguni, Agnuni,

691
00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:24.40
asked if Talaat knew about this. And when the police chief showed him the arrest warrant,

692
00:59:24.40 --> 00:59:30.96
be bearing Talaat's signature, Agnuni was even more stunned and replied that he had been at Talaat's

693
00:59:30.96 --> 00:59:37.52
for dinner a short while before. And wanted to know why Talaat hadn't said anything about it.

694
00:59:39.04 --> 00:59:45.52
The unfortunate Anaguni being an idealistic and honorable man could not comprehend how Talaat

695
00:59:45.52 --> 00:59:51.12
could plot against him so cynically. The same Talaat whom he had sheltered in order to save Talaat's

696
00:59:51.12 --> 00:59:58.48
life while risking his own during the counterrevolution following March 31, 1909, along with his

697
00:59:58.48 --> 01:00:07.92
five comrades, Agnuni was taken from Idaesh. About four fifths of the way he realized that he was

698
01:00:07.92 --> 01:00:16.96
going to be murdered. And when Vahak, the well-known leader of the dashnacks was warned by his friends

699
01:00:16.96 --> 01:00:25.44
in Adana. He answered calmly and with deep conviction. As long as Jamal Pasha, who's the official

700
01:00:25.44 --> 01:00:33.28
intrargetarian Palestine, is alive, no one can touch a hair on my head. Then pointing to a large portrait

701
01:00:33.28 --> 01:00:39.68
of Jamal Pasha in a guilt-frain, prominently displayed in his room, he said, long live my good friend

702
01:00:40.32 --> 01:00:48.16
and friend of the Armenians. Jamal Pasha. I recall in detail the circumstances of Vahak's hanging

703
01:00:48.16 --> 01:00:58.16
ordered by Jamal Pasha. So here you have these people who are, they're looking, you know, it's like,

704
01:00:58.16 --> 01:01:02.64
hey, well, that guy's a friend of mine. He's not going to do this to me. One of them, you know,

705
01:01:02.64 --> 01:01:07.36
one of them talking about Talaat. I already took care of Talaat. He's going to take care of me.

706
01:01:09.04 --> 01:01:11.52
Or, you know, I, Jamal Pasha, he's a friend of mine.

707
01:01:11.52 --> 01:01:19.52
You know, there's a, from another book that you mentioned earlier,

708
01:01:22.72 --> 01:01:27.12
they have another interesting thing. You know, this is around the time when we start cat read

709
01:01:27.12 --> 01:01:33.76
and we have documents, documents that explain what, what orders were being given. And there's

710
01:01:33.76 --> 01:01:39.04
speaking of Talaat who is overall in charge of the government and the architect of the genocide,

711
01:01:39.04 --> 01:01:48.000
one of the documents, there's like a reluctant regional governor who was kind of kind of playing

712
01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.88
dumb. Hey, I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do. Is this really what you want? And Talaat sent

713
01:01:52.88 --> 01:02:07.20
a three word telegram that said, Yack, for old year, that's it. And those, those words mean burn,

714
01:02:07.20 --> 01:02:17.92
demolish, kill. No room for confusion there. No room for confusion there. And that's how we,

715
01:02:17.92 --> 01:02:26.96
that's how we start moving into this, this situation just disintegrates now. Yeah. So if you look

716
01:02:26.96 --> 01:02:33.92
at why the Ottoman Empire was brought into the war by the Germans, what did the Ottoman Empire

717
01:02:33.92 --> 01:02:37.60
get out of it? What did the Germans expect to get out of it? What the Germans expected to get out of it

718
01:02:37.60 --> 01:02:42.80
was look, they're facing the British, the French, and the Russians. All three of them have been

719
01:02:42.80 --> 01:02:46.80
taking away territory from the Ottoman Empire for years. The Ottoman Empire would like to take

720
01:02:46.80 --> 01:02:50.88
that territory back, and these other three would like to keep it. So if the Ottoman Empire doesn't

721
01:02:50.88 --> 01:02:54.96
have to help us conquer the world here or anything, if they can just put some pressure on Egypt,

722
01:02:54.96 --> 01:03:00.32
put some pressure on the Caucasus and on the Balkans, then these other three empires that the

723
01:03:00.32 --> 01:03:05.36
Germans are facing are going to have to like redirect some resources to defend them. That's the idea.

724
01:03:05.36 --> 01:03:09.68
And for the Ottoman Empire, they thought this is an opportunity to get some territory back

725
01:03:09.68 --> 01:03:16.88
and also to fortify our position internally so that when this war is over, we don't have

726
01:03:17.52 --> 01:03:26.40
any problems inside that can be exploited again later. And the Ottoman Empire was not,

727
01:03:27.12 --> 01:03:30.96
look, the Turks can fight, they can still fight to this day from what I understand. I mean,

728
01:03:30.96 --> 01:03:34.64
there are a warrior people and they carry that in them, but they were not prepared for this war.

729
01:03:34.64 --> 01:03:37.04
They weren't prepared to go toe to toe with the British Empire.

730
01:03:37.04 --> 01:03:43.76
And with the Russian Empire. And so the first thing that happens, you mentioned Talat Pasha,

731
01:03:44.88 --> 01:03:49.12
and you mentioned Jamal Pasha. Those were two out of the three people who were kind of the Ottoman

732
01:03:49.12 --> 01:03:54.16
triumvirate during the first World War. Talat was the interior minister and he was the head of government

733
01:03:54.16 --> 01:04:00.48
for all effective purposes. Jamal Pasha was the head of the navy and he was the military governor of

734
01:04:00.48 --> 01:04:04.48
Syria, which is a much bigger territory than we're talking about today. It was really like all

735
01:04:04.48 --> 01:04:10.96
of Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, like that whole thing. And he was known by the Arabs in Damascus,

736
01:04:10.96 --> 01:04:17.44
by the way, as the butcher, he was he starved to death very similar to the way Stalin did the holiday

737
01:04:17.44 --> 01:04:23.36
more. He starved to death a few hundred thousand Lebanese Christians in Mount Lebanon where

738
01:04:24.24 --> 01:04:31.04
he was taking all of food sending it out to the front, not allowing any food aid or anything else

739
01:04:31.04 --> 01:04:36.000
to come in. And a few hundred thousand people just starved to death on the streets. There are accounts

740
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:42.08
from people who are there like American University and other Western missionaries in diplomats who say

741
01:04:42.08 --> 01:04:48.56
they would put cotton balls in their ears in their houses because outside it was just moaning children,

742
01:04:48.56 --> 01:04:53.28
moaning women, people dying on the streets begging for food. It just sounded like the zombie

743
01:04:53.28 --> 01:04:58.88
apocalypse out there. Just moans, day and night, people dying. You go out in the morning and open

744
01:04:58.88 --> 01:05:05.44
up your door and there's a dead child on your doorstep. I mean, Mount Lebanon lost 50% of its population

745
01:05:05.44 --> 01:05:09.68
up there. It was one of the worst hit parts of the entire country. And so those are two of the guys.

746
01:05:09.68 --> 01:05:14.32
And the third one, remember that Triumph, where it is in Ver paasha, and paasha is just a term of

747
01:05:14.32 --> 01:05:19.20
respect in the Ottoman Empire. It's a very high ranking, like official basically. It's not there.

748
01:05:19.20 --> 01:05:26.16
They're not brothers or anything. And so in Ver decides, you know, Napoleon tried to invade Russia

749
01:05:26.16 --> 01:05:30.88
in the winter. Hitler's going to try and do it in a few decades. Not going to go well for either

750
01:05:30.88 --> 01:05:35.36
of those guys, but screw it. Let's go for it. And so he gets his force and he tries to go up into

751
01:05:35.36 --> 01:05:39.36
the caucuses and face the Russian army up there. Maybe feeling like he's going to catch them off guard.

752
01:05:39.36 --> 01:05:45.04
He doesn't. The battle of Sarah Comash happens and the Russians wiping out and pushing him way back.

753
01:05:45.04 --> 01:05:49.76
And so now the Ottoman Empire is really starting to panic, right? If you look at like when the

754
01:05:49.76 --> 01:05:57.52
Holocaust really kicked into gear, it wasn't 1939, it wasn't 1940, it wasn't even really in early 1941.

755
01:05:58.16 --> 01:06:03.20
It was after the Germans got within seven miles of Moscow and then those Siberian troops showed up

756
01:06:03.20 --> 01:06:07.68
and pushed the Germans back and they realized this might not work out the way we thought it was going to.

757
01:06:08.88 --> 01:06:14.24
And they said, well, what else can we accomplish then? What else can we accomplish? And

758
01:06:15.36 --> 01:06:19.20
because the caucus is over there. If you look at the territory, Eastern Turkey,

759
01:06:19.20 --> 01:06:24.24
you know, the Armenians in Southeast or Eastern Turkey, they're right across the border as more

760
01:06:24.24 --> 01:06:28.88
Armenians. That's modern Armenia, right across the border today. And so, and these people didn't,

761
01:06:28.88 --> 01:06:32.64
you know, they were separate, don't keep you wrong. They even spoke really different dialects,

762
01:06:32.64 --> 01:06:35.92
you know, two large-degree and stuff, but they still knew that those were their Armenian cousins

763
01:06:35.92 --> 01:06:39.52
over the border and they knew it back and forth. Kind of like the curbs in southern Turkey in northern

764
01:06:39.52 --> 01:06:47.76
Syria today. And so when the Russian army pushes past, it passed that border into Eastern Turkey,

765
01:06:47.76 --> 01:06:55.28
the Ottoman Empire, thinking with some, just as I was some reason that these people who they

766
01:06:55.28 --> 01:07:00.48
had just massacred, a few hundred thousand of a few decades back and have been allowing to be abused

767
01:07:00.48 --> 01:07:05.60
by the Kurds and everybody else who wants a peace in the decades since, that the Russians are going

768
01:07:05.60 --> 01:07:09.84
to mobilize these people and put them to work against the Ottoman Empire. And so, as the Turks are

769
01:07:09.84 --> 01:07:16.72
retreating, they are just slaughtering and burning and destroying everything they can. Just terrorizing

770
01:07:16.72 --> 01:07:21.76
Armenians, murdering the people they see, especially military-age men. Most of the military-age

771
01:07:21.76 --> 01:07:30.24
men, by this point, have either been conscripted into the military and then disarmed, put into a

772
01:07:30.24 --> 01:07:34.88
slave labor battalion. And by the time you get up to 1915 around the battle of the Lippoli,

773
01:07:35.60 --> 01:07:41.52
they'll be worked to death or simply murdered. Generally speaking, they would get these men who

774
01:07:41.52 --> 01:07:46.40
the Armenians who showed up for the draft and tell them, you're going to go into the interior,

775
01:07:46.40 --> 01:07:50.32
we're going to build trenches, defensive fortifications, and they'd all go and they'd spend all

776
01:07:50.32 --> 01:07:54.16
they'd digging a trench and they'd be like, great job. Can you stand on the edge of it, please?

777
01:07:54.56 --> 01:07:58.08
And then they would murder them all and then fill the trench in. It was a mass grave, they'd been

778
01:07:58.08 --> 01:08:04.16
digging for themselves the entire time. And so, as this is going on, you have the other Armenian

779
01:08:04.16 --> 01:08:12.08
young man, military-age men who were like, well, they either saw that coming or maybe they

780
01:08:12.08 --> 01:08:15.60
didn't want to leave their home villages because they were already getting attacked by Kurdish

781
01:08:15.60 --> 01:08:19.44
tribes every other day and they said, I can't leave my wife and kids here and my parents here.

782
01:08:19.44 --> 01:08:23.68
And so, they just refused to go. But that meant you had to go into hiding, you had to go somewhere

783
01:08:23.68 --> 01:08:28.96
because the Turks found you as a rap. And so, all of these villages that the retreating

784
01:08:28.96 --> 01:08:33.20
Ottoman army is coming back through and just murdering and terrorizing, these are pretty much

785
01:08:33.20 --> 01:08:38.56
all women-children-old people. And that's going to be a theme throughout the entire story.

786
01:08:38.56 --> 01:08:43.04
Is the men are already gone? The men have already been killed a long time ago or they've had to

787
01:08:43.04 --> 01:08:50.48
run away across the Russian, you know, across the Russian battle lines. A lot of them did go join

788
01:08:50.48 --> 01:08:56.24
the Russian forces once the genocide kicked in. And so, a lot of the stuff that we're going to be

789
01:08:56.24 --> 01:08:59.76
that we're going to be hearing about going forward, this is all stuff that's being done pretty

790
01:08:59.76 --> 01:09:07.92
much entirely to groups of women-children and old people by military fighters. And so, that's

791
01:09:07.92 --> 01:09:13.20
that first step, disarming and then killing the Armenian men who had joined the military happens.

792
01:09:13.20 --> 01:09:17.28
And the second thing that the Ottoman Empire needs to do, this is before the real genocide,

793
01:09:17.28 --> 01:09:21.68
the mass deportations and killing really start in a systematic way. You know, they have to

794
01:09:21.68 --> 01:09:27.04
lay the groundwork for it and after disarming the Armenian military people, they decided they

795
01:09:27.04 --> 01:09:32.24
needed to get rid of these two towns that they expected would put up resistance because they had

796
01:09:32.24 --> 01:09:37.44
done so before. They did so during the Hamidian masquerers in the 1890s. In fact, one of them, Zetun,

797
01:09:38.16 --> 01:09:42.96
which was a, you know, these are mountain men. You know, these are tough people that even

798
01:09:42.96 --> 01:09:47.52
other Armenians kind of looked at them like they were a little bit crude and uncivilized.

799
01:09:47.52 --> 01:09:52.08
They were like, uh, Appalachian scotch Irish kind of like the way we in America look at

800
01:09:52.08 --> 01:09:55.84
those Appalachian folks like man, they're wild and they're kind of crazy and whatever, but

801
01:09:55.84 --> 01:10:00.08
boy, like, uh, you start problems with them, then you're going to have some problems yourself. Like,

802
01:10:00.08 --> 01:10:06.40
they're not going to, you're very independent minded and not used to or down with being told

803
01:10:06.40 --> 01:10:13.04
what to do by people. And Zetun was up in the up in the hills and they knew that they were not going

804
01:10:13.04 --> 01:10:17.44
to just accept this and they had the capacity to actually push back a little bit. So they

805
01:10:17.44 --> 01:10:22.24
they started the maskilling across Anatolia at the time. They might have to worry about these

806
01:10:22.24 --> 01:10:26.72
two places either turning into fortresses where Armenians could retreat and then from there who knows

807
01:10:27.36 --> 01:10:31.68
or just that they could turn out enough partisan fighters. They could really create problems

808
01:10:31.68 --> 01:10:36.000
in, uh, in the re-reational one. And so they go there first and they just, um,

809
01:10:37.36 --> 01:10:41.36
they wiped those places out. They go to van, Vaughan is the second one besides Zetun.

810
01:10:42.08 --> 01:10:47.92
And, um, you know, they go in and, uh, give them an ultimatum, tell all your men to come out.

811
01:10:47.92 --> 01:10:51.92
Uh, they do this under the under the guise of like we're looking for draft Dodgers and

812
01:10:51.92 --> 01:10:56.56
deserters and so forth. And so they show up and they just round up anybody who's there who's

813
01:10:56.56 --> 01:11:02.48
important, right? Any of the older men who are leaders, if there's any writers or singers or poets,

814
01:11:02.48 --> 01:11:07.44
if there's anybody who's prominent who could serve in a leadership capacity, you know,

815
01:11:07.44 --> 01:11:12.08
a sort of a collecting point for people, a rallying point. They take all them, they torture them,

816
01:11:12.80 --> 01:11:17.44
and they kill a bunch of them. And then they give the rest of the people an opportunity to

817
01:11:17.44 --> 01:11:22.64
turn in any of the men who are still around or anything. And instead the people in van barricade themselves

818
01:11:22.64 --> 01:11:27.92
into the town and say, we're not coming out, give us back our, our notables, give us back our, our men,

819
01:11:27.92 --> 01:11:33.76
our leaders. And so, uh, instead they roll in artillery and they just start shelling the town

820
01:11:33.76 --> 01:11:39.12
and, um, intermittently they'll send in Muslim mobs to go in and massacre the people who were in there.

821
01:11:39.76 --> 01:11:44.08
And eventually, uh, they, they kill enough people that they're able to get all the women and

822
01:11:44.08 --> 01:11:48.24
children out and they send them marching south into the desert. They do something very similar and

823
01:11:48.24 --> 01:11:54.40
they tune as well. Surrounded with artillery, um, burned down the monastery where a bunch of the

824
01:11:54.40 --> 01:11:59.76
younger men were hiding. And then the women and children who were left there, thousands and thousands,

825
01:11:59.76 --> 01:12:06.08
20,000 or so and they tune actually. Um, actually, so yeah, actually, I left out one other

826
01:12:06.08 --> 01:12:11.20
thing. This is another thing that they, that they did to compel people is when the people in van

827
01:12:11.20 --> 01:12:15.12
were holed up and refusing to come out. They said, okay, Roger that and they just started going

828
01:12:15.12 --> 01:12:21.84
to all the villages around the town and just maskering all the people there. And, um, once they

829
01:12:21.84 --> 01:12:26.32
had pacified the area, they got all the women, children, uh, and old people who were left and they

830
01:12:26.32 --> 01:12:31.04
put them into care of ants under guard and they sent them marching south into the desert. And,

831
01:12:31.04 --> 01:12:35.76
you know, this is northern northern Syria, southern Turkey. That's what we're talking about here.

832
01:12:35.76 --> 01:12:39.36
So, you have, like, a lepo and was solo over in a rack that whole area. They just sent them

833
01:12:39.36 --> 01:12:45.52
marching south. Um, and then step three came. And this was really the thing that kicked off

834
01:12:46.32 --> 01:12:50.64
the program. Now that all of the men with guns have been neutralized, guys in the military,

835
01:12:51.28 --> 01:12:54.96
now that these two potential trouble sides of an and they tune or taking care of,

836
01:12:55.92 --> 01:13:00.72
they wanted to make sure that all of the Armenian national level leaders were neutralized. And so

837
01:13:00.72 --> 01:13:04.08
all of these men who are in Constantinople and Smyrna and some of the other big cities,

838
01:13:04.72 --> 01:13:08.48
including Gregorius Balakion, the priest who's book we're reading today,

839
01:13:08.48 --> 01:13:17.44
we're all arrested and deported down south as well. And, um, they could tell from the beginning that,

840
01:13:17.44 --> 01:13:21.44
uh, this was something probably a little bit different than what they had seen before.

841
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:30.64
Well, speaking on the book, let's get a little, um, I witnessed a count going back to the book.

842
01:13:30.64 --> 01:13:38.80
On the night of Saturday, April 24th, 1915, the Armenians of the capital city exhausted from

843
01:13:38.80 --> 01:13:44.32
the Easter celebrations that had come to an end a few days earlier, we're snoring in a calm sleep.

844
01:13:46.48 --> 01:13:50.80
Meanwhile, on the heights of Stambul, a highly secret activity was taking place in the

845
01:13:50.80 --> 01:13:56.56
palatial central police station. Groups of Armenians had just been arrested in the suburbs

846
01:13:56.56 --> 01:14:02.24
and neighborhoods of the capital, blood-colored military buses were now transporting them to central

847
01:14:02.24 --> 01:14:08.24
prison. Weeks earlier, the Constantinople chief of police had sent official sealed orders to all

848
01:14:08.24 --> 01:14:14.48
guard houses with the instruction that they not be open until the designated day, and that they be carried

849
01:14:14.48 --> 01:14:24.32
out with precision and encequercy. On this Saturday night, I, along with eight friends, were

850
01:14:24.32 --> 01:14:32.24
transported by a small steamboat. The night smelled of death. The sea was rough, and our hearts

851
01:14:32.24 --> 01:14:40.08
were filled with terror. We prisoners were under strict police guard, not allowed to speak to one another.

852
01:14:40.08 --> 01:14:45.44
We had no idea where we were going. We arrived at the central prison and here, behind gigantic

853
01:14:45.44 --> 01:14:51.04
walls and large-boated gates, they put us in a wooden pavilion in the courtyard, which was said

854
01:14:51.04 --> 01:14:56.32
by some to have once served as a school. We sat there quiet and somber on a bare wooden floor

855
01:14:56.32 --> 01:15:01.36
under the faint light of a flickering lantern, two stunned and confused to make sense of what was happening.

856
01:15:03.68 --> 01:15:09.04
From the deep silence of the night until morning, every few hours, Armenians were brought to

857
01:15:09.04 --> 01:15:16.24
the prison. And so behind these high walls, the jostling and commotion increased as the crowd of

858
01:15:16.24 --> 01:15:24.24
prisoners became denser. It was as if all the prominent Armenian public figures, assemblymen,

859
01:15:24.24 --> 01:15:29.52
representatives, revolutionaries, editors, teachers, doctors, pharmacists, dentists, merchants,

860
01:15:29.52 --> 01:15:35.36
bankers, and others in the capital city had made an appointment to meet in these dim prison cells.

861
01:15:37.52 --> 01:15:45.68
Some even appeared in nightclothes and slippers. The more those familiar faces kept appearing,

862
01:15:45.68 --> 01:15:49.12
the more the chatter abated and our anxiety grew.

863
01:15:51.60 --> 01:15:57.36
Before long, everyone looks solemn, our hearts heavy and full of worry about the and impending storm.

864
01:16:00.24 --> 01:16:05.60
Not one of us understood why we had been arrested and no one could assess the consequences,

865
01:16:05.60 --> 01:16:08.48
as the nights hours slipped by are distressed mounted.

866
01:16:09.68 --> 01:16:15.52
Except for a few rare stoics, we were in a state of spiritual anguish, terrified of the unknown,

867
01:16:15.52 --> 01:16:23.52
and longing for comfort. Right through till morning, new Armenian prisoners arrived in each time

868
01:16:23.52 --> 01:16:28.16
we heard the roar of the military cars. We heard to the windows to see who they were.

869
01:16:28.16 --> 01:16:33.36
The new arrivals had contemptuous smiles on their faces, but when they saw hundreds of

870
01:16:33.36 --> 01:16:38.000
other well-known Armenians old and young around them, they too sank into fear.

871
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:48.48
We were all searching for answers, asking what all of this meant, and pondering our fate.

872
01:16:52.08 --> 01:16:58.16
So these are all of the most famous Armenians in the country. These are the prominent priests,

873
01:16:58.96 --> 01:17:03.12
the writers in the big cities. These are the people who everybody in our, and everybody,

874
01:17:03.12 --> 01:17:08.32
every Armenian in Turkey knew who these people were. They knew them by name for the most part.

875
01:17:08.32 --> 01:17:14.88
And so they wanted to take them out immediately and just get them out of circulation at first.

876
01:17:16.16 --> 01:17:20.08
And they did it secretly. They did it quietly on April 24th, 1915,

877
01:17:20.08 --> 01:17:23.52
which is Armenian genocide remembrance day, because this is where it really kicks off.

878
01:17:23.52 --> 01:17:31.92
Once they did that, all most of the pieces were in place to begin the campaign of mass killing.

879
01:17:31.92 --> 01:17:38.56
The only things that remain were, there was this organization called the special organization.

880
01:17:38.56 --> 01:17:41.68
There had actually been set up for a previous war with the Russians,

881
01:17:42.48 --> 01:17:45.52
but they used it for a different purpose and augmented it with different people here.

882
01:17:47.12 --> 01:17:54.56
They freed about some 10-15,000 violent convicts from prisons, including thousands of murderers and rapists.

883
01:17:55.44 --> 01:18:00.96
And they freed them and promised them a pardon if they would ride with this group called the special

884
01:18:00.96 --> 01:18:05.76
organization, which was put under the command of the most fanatical anti-Armenian young Turks.

885
01:18:06.72 --> 01:18:16.24
And their job was to terrorize the Armenian population in an unrestrained manner.

886
01:18:17.52 --> 01:18:24.40
We think about genocide again, we're very influenced by the Holocaust and the way we think about these things.

887
01:18:24.40 --> 01:18:26.72
We think about a cool, exact discipline.

888
01:18:26.72 --> 01:18:30.000
And systematic, it's like, okay, what's your number?

889
01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.36
You can check that one off.

890
01:18:31.36 --> 01:18:36.16
And that's not how this was carried out.

891
01:18:36.16 --> 01:18:40.40
And this special organization is a good illustration of how that is.

892
01:18:40.40 --> 01:18:47.12
I mean, most genocides, when you look at millions of people dying in the Civil War and the Congo or in Sudan,

893
01:18:47.12 --> 01:18:50.24
you say, well, how's that happening? They don't have gas chambers there.

894
01:18:51.12 --> 01:18:55.36
They're not even going around and individually shooting every person that's there.

895
01:18:55.36 --> 01:18:57.92
You don't have to do that. All you have to do is go to one village.

896
01:19:00.32 --> 01:19:05.44
Not just kill them, but do it in the most horrific ways you can possibly imagine and make sure

897
01:19:05.44 --> 01:19:08.24
that a few people get away to go warn the next village over.

898
01:19:08.24 --> 01:19:12.88
And then those people who are mostly women, children and old people, because the men are all fighting

899
01:19:12.88 --> 01:19:17.60
or, you know, you can't be there when the army shows up, when the militia shows up,

900
01:19:17.60 --> 01:19:21.84
they say, we got to get out of here. So they take their kids and their grandparents and they run off into the bush.

901
01:19:21.84 --> 01:19:26.40
And defenseless women, children and old people die very quickly in the bush,

902
01:19:26.40 --> 01:19:30.16
while they die very quickly in the desert too. And so this was part of the goal.

903
01:19:30.16 --> 01:19:36.96
It's to go out there and terrorize brutally and make sure that word of that spreads to the other

904
01:19:36.96 --> 01:19:42.40
groups of these people get moving. Because if we can do that, they'll finish themselves off.

905
01:19:42.40 --> 01:19:47.60
We won't have to go around. Most of the, most of the Ottoman soldiers, they're off at the front.

906
01:19:47.60 --> 01:19:54.32
You know, this is being carried out by older John Don, police soldiers, ordinary men, type people,

907
01:19:54.32 --> 01:19:59.36
right? Like guys like that, as well as by local villagers and Kurdish tribes that they couldn't

908
01:19:59.36 --> 01:20:05.92
a conscripted if they wanted to. And it was helped along by the level of just savagery that they would

909
01:20:05.92 --> 01:20:13.92
perform these massacres in. And finally, the once everything else was in place,

910
01:20:13.92 --> 01:20:18.48
and this kind of happened systematically, I guess, over the, over the period of time that the

911
01:20:18.48 --> 01:20:23.92
genocide was taking place, but the central government worked to identify governors and mayors of

912
01:20:23.92 --> 01:20:29.36
local areas that might be reluctant to do what they needed to do. And when they were identified,

913
01:20:29.36 --> 01:20:32.64
they were taken out. Some of them were going in jail and some of them were even killed.

914
01:20:33.36 --> 01:20:37.12
But a lot of them were just reassigned to other places. One of them you started off talking about

915
01:20:37.12 --> 01:20:41.60
with a quote about what happened in Ankara. And that was an example, actually. That was one where

916
01:20:41.60 --> 01:20:47.60
the guy who, the valley, the governor of, of that province, he was trying to almost be a

917
01:20:47.60 --> 01:20:51.44
Oscar Schindler type. He got together a bunch of prominent Turks in the area, had them

918
01:20:52.08 --> 01:20:56.000
right a letter and sign a letter that he sent back to Constantinople saying, hey, look,

919
01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.76
whatever's going anywhere else. Like, our Armenians are actually cool. Like, we know them. They're

920
01:20:59.76 --> 01:21:05.36
not a problem. They're loyal. And so that guy was just fired and sent off to some random spot in

921
01:21:05.36 --> 01:21:14.40
the Empire. And his successor came in and immediately went to work, searched all the Armenian homes

922
01:21:14.40 --> 01:21:20.56
for weapons. Took them all the way right down to all their kitchen knives. The local jails there were

923
01:21:20.56 --> 01:21:28.88
emptied all the convicts were turned into paramilitaries. And once everything was in place, they got to work.

924
01:21:28.88 --> 01:21:38.72
You know, you think about that. If you were going to write like a freaking psycho,

925
01:21:38.72 --> 01:21:45.04
dystopic movie, right, what are you going to do? You're going to take the local criminals,

926
01:21:45.04 --> 01:21:49.84
rapists, murderers, and you're going to empower them and give them a authority.

927
01:21:50.56 --> 01:21:56.08
And total license. And in fact, encourage them to be as brutal as possible because

928
01:21:56.08 --> 01:22:01.52
that's part of the plan, you know, to drive these people out into the desert through brutality.

929
01:22:03.84 --> 01:22:08.72
It ends up looking like this going back to the book. The prominent prisoners, lawyers,

930
01:22:08.72 --> 01:22:14.48
bankers, merchants, and Armenian government officials were taken out on the road in the first

931
01:22:14.48 --> 01:22:20.72
care of an under the supervision of the police commissioner. The prison warden police soldiers and

932
01:22:20.72 --> 01:22:27.92
officers. Overall, superintendents was assigned to Shem Sedan, the son of Tobib, a member of the

933
01:22:27.92 --> 01:22:34.40
Ottoman parliament from Ankara. Although those in the Caravan were the distinguished people of the

934
01:22:34.40 --> 01:22:41.04
city, a mark was put on their arms and their feces, shoes, and coats were taken from them

935
01:22:41.04 --> 01:22:48.72
before they left the prison. Then these 150 sew or sew were taken out to the foot of town

936
01:22:48.72 --> 01:22:57.28
and tied together with a rope. The tools that would be used to kill these Armenians,

937
01:22:57.28 --> 01:23:03.84
axes, clevers, paddles, large knives, and other weapons were transported in four or five

938
01:23:03.84 --> 01:23:09.60
carriages directly behind the Caravan and following them were carriages filled with lime.

939
01:23:09.60 --> 01:23:18.56
To make sure that the crying and screaming of the people in this caravan would not be heard,

940
01:23:18.56 --> 01:23:24.56
some of the soldiers were ordered to play trumpets and drums as they left Ankara via the town's

941
01:23:24.56 --> 01:23:33.44
famous Toshcon section. Seven hours from the town, this dust-covered caravan reached the forest.

942
01:23:33.44 --> 01:23:45.12
They were met by the special organization. The freed criminals used as anti-Armenian death

943
01:23:45.12 --> 01:23:52.72
squads who possessed all kinds of weapons, a well-known lawyer. Armunog pleaded with the chief

944
01:23:52.72 --> 01:23:58.08
of the bandit group to be given as the sacred last right of one condemned to death,

945
01:23:58.08 --> 01:24:05.04
permission to say a few words. He received permission. Then he said with unusual cold

946
01:24:05.04 --> 01:24:12.08
hardness and a cavalier indifference to death that surprised even the special organization.

947
01:24:12.08 --> 01:24:15.76
It is no longer a secret that you have brought us here to be killed.

948
01:24:18.24 --> 01:24:20.96
But I want to ask you if you know why you are going to kill us.

949
01:24:20.96 --> 01:24:29.52
Leader of the bandit's answer that he didn't know why. Armunog continued. You should know

950
01:24:29.52 --> 01:24:34.72
that the high-ranking officials and the committee who gave you the orders to kill us did so

951
01:24:34.72 --> 01:24:40.80
solely to secure their personal gain and that they are leaving a stain on your history and laying

952
01:24:40.80 --> 01:24:53.12
waste to the fatherland. Barely had he spoke these prophetic words when hundreds of this

953
01:24:53.12 --> 01:25:00.48
special organization sheets attached from all sides, cutting and hacking off legs and arms and

954
01:25:00.48 --> 01:25:11.36
necks with axes and hatchets ripping them off partly or entirely and crushing heads with rocks.

955
01:25:11.36 --> 01:25:17.20
The bodies were thrown half alive dead or in the throws of death to be prepared ditches into

956
01:25:17.20 --> 01:25:25.20
prepared ditches and covered with lime. Those who were partly sticking out of the dirt and the lime

957
01:25:25.20 --> 01:25:32.64
made the heavenly arches resound with their cries of agony. More dirt was poured on them until they

958
01:25:32.64 --> 01:25:43.28
were buried alive. When the massacre of the first caravan was finished, the second caravan of

959
01:25:43.28 --> 01:25:52.96
more than 320 people was sent forward. Transported to the park known as Kayaesh, six hours from

960
01:25:52.96 --> 01:26:00.64
town, these people were massacred in the same merciless manner. The dismembered bodies of the

961
01:26:00.64 --> 01:26:06.48
martyrs were left unbehried for 15 days, Turkish officers then oversaw their burial by our

962
01:26:06.48 --> 01:26:15.68
minion labor soldiers. After massacring all these people, the special organization came back to

963
01:26:15.68 --> 01:26:25.28
town, wearing clothes, shoes and other items they had taken from them. Everywhere they boasted

964
01:26:25.28 --> 01:26:30.72
about how many Armenians they had killed and how in unheard of ways they had tortured and

965
01:26:30.72 --> 01:26:40.16
dismembered those who were still alive and even mutilated corpses. Similar massacres

966
01:26:40.16 --> 01:26:48.000
took place in other towns and villages with particular curr-cruity in Yazgat.

967
01:26:49.60 --> 01:26:54.88
First all the Armenian males of the town or city and then the women and girls were bound

968
01:26:54.88 --> 01:27:01.12
together and taken on foot to deep valleys a few hours away, accompanied by a Turkish mob

969
01:27:01.12 --> 01:27:15.52
armed with access. There they were slaughtered like sheep, pregnant women and suckling babes included.

970
01:27:22.96 --> 01:27:29.20
And that's how it went. Over and over and over and over and over. It's one of the things about genocide

971
01:27:29.20 --> 01:27:36.32
is you ever watch a movie about one or read a decent book written about a genocide they'll usually

972
01:27:36.32 --> 01:27:42.08
find some dramatic persona to focus on so that they have some kind of drama with it some story

973
01:27:42.08 --> 01:27:48.08
liner arc to follow because when you get down to it what it comes down to is we went to this village.

974
01:27:48.08 --> 01:27:51.92
We killed all the men. We raped all the women. We robbed all their stuff. Took their children

975
01:27:51.92 --> 01:27:57.12
his slaves and then we laughed and then we went to the next village and we raped all the women.

976
01:27:57.12 --> 01:28:01.76
We killed all the men. We took the children his slaves robbed all their stuff and we left and it's that

977
01:28:01.76 --> 01:28:09.28
100 times a thousand times. You know you can't tell a Holocaust story or a right a Holocaust book

978
01:28:10.40 --> 01:28:16.32
that's just they marched 10,000 people to the edge of the mass graves. They shot him naked and they

979
01:28:16.32 --> 01:28:19.68
threw him in and they took these. It's just it gets repetitive in the most

980
01:28:19.68 --> 01:28:29.04
grotesque way imaginable and that's what a genocide is. The depravity of it is easy to focus on but in many ways

981
01:28:29.04 --> 01:28:36.24
the especially after it's been going on for months or years and the people themselves the killers

982
01:28:36.24 --> 01:28:41.04
themselves have been almost brutalized psychologically and spiritually by what they're doing and it

983
01:28:41.04 --> 01:28:48.64
becomes routine for them so that things that some individuals may have hesitated to do it first or not

984
01:28:48.64 --> 01:28:55.44
things that elicit any kind of hesitation anymore that it just becomes this grind of death.

985
01:28:57.20 --> 01:29:06.72
And one of the things that makes the Armenian genocide a thing that is I guess you could maybe

986
01:29:06.72 --> 01:29:14.32
only compare it to what happened in Rwanda in so far as the extent to which the general population

987
01:29:14.32 --> 01:29:22.48
was mobilized to participate. Something like again like with the Germans. This was something

988
01:29:22.48 --> 01:29:27.04
you know, Ernst Younger during the Second World War was stationed in Paris. He was sort of a cultural

989
01:29:27.04 --> 01:29:31.28
figure that I that point so he was kind of there as like a technically was some kind of a minister

990
01:29:31.28 --> 01:29:37.52
of this or that I can't remember but really was there as like a cultural figure and he was in Paris

991
01:29:37.52 --> 01:29:43.52
1942, you know 1941 and he's writing letters to people trying to figure out like I keep hearing about

992
01:29:43.52 --> 01:29:46.88
all these things that are going on out and polling down the east like what's going on out in the

993
01:29:46.88 --> 01:29:50.80
east like I hear about bad things going on east. This is Ernst Younger. I mean this is a guy that

994
01:29:50.80 --> 01:29:56.48
even the Nazis like thought this guy was great you know there was there was possibility that he was

995
01:29:57.12 --> 01:30:03.60
in on one of the failed assassination attempts. Maybe he knew about it at least but Hitler himself

996
01:30:03.60 --> 01:30:07.84
even said nobody touches Ernst Younger. This is the guy. This is the guy that wrote Stormusty.

997
01:30:07.84 --> 01:30:13.92
I forget which podcast we covered up that on but I mean this guy is a hero to the German people.

998
01:30:13.92 --> 01:30:19.84
Yeah and so even him a guy in that position serving as a minister in Paris at the time he's like

999
01:30:20.40 --> 01:30:24.64
trying to find out what's going on in the east because the way that that was conducted and you know

1000
01:30:24.64 --> 01:30:29.12
it gets overplayed a little bit how secret it was and everything. It did take a large number of

1001
01:30:29.12 --> 01:30:34.96
people including the vermark to pull off some of it but relatively speaking this was something that was

1002
01:30:34.96 --> 01:30:40.80
able to be kept from the German people and to be localized to the SS and like you know the people

1003
01:30:40.80 --> 01:30:47.04
who were actually handling it. Yeah and it's one thing to you know the okay so the German

1004
01:30:47.04 --> 01:30:52.80
populists is let's say they're helping round-up Jews but that's what they think they're doing

1005
01:30:52.80 --> 01:30:55.92
is rounding up the Jews or they're going to ship them off they're going to be slave labor they don't

1006
01:30:55.92 --> 01:31:03.92
they many cases didn't know the end state right whereas here we have the the Turkish population at

1007
01:31:03.92 --> 01:31:13.44
large doing the tactical operation of genocide. Yes and you know there's a quote from a great book

1008
01:31:13.44 --> 01:31:18.64
I know I've brought it up a few times another podcast that by Philip Garevich about the Roman

1009
01:31:18.64 --> 01:31:22.64
in genocide we was to inform you that tomorrow we killed with our families and he has a quote in

1010
01:31:22.64 --> 01:31:29.28
there when he's talking about what genocide is and the two the society that's perpetrating it and

1011
01:31:29.28 --> 01:31:34.40
he has this line that's always stuck with me says genocide after all is a sort of community building

1012
01:31:34.40 --> 01:31:41.28
exercise and that stuck with me as I was reading all the material about the Armenian genocide in

1013
01:31:41.28 --> 01:31:47.04
the way that it's specific way that it was handled one of the things that happened was these people

1014
01:31:47.04 --> 01:31:52.000
who would be deported down south when I say that what I'm talking about is you know all the men

1015
01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.64
would be killed and the women children and old people who were left would be put into a caravan

1016
01:31:56.64 --> 01:32:00.32
they'd be sent down to march in the Syrian desert on a march that would take about two months

1017
01:32:01.92 --> 01:32:05.52
and when they got to the end it was just there was a death camp there where they would anybody

1018
01:32:05.52 --> 01:32:10.48
who survived two months with you know no food because it would all be taken from them right away

1019
01:32:11.20 --> 01:32:15.36
you know if they couldn't scrounge bugs out of the desert or eat dead bodies or whatever they

1020
01:32:15.36 --> 01:32:19.76
had to do they'd buy a starvation if they couldn't if you weren't a woman who could

1021
01:32:19.76 --> 01:32:27.68
you know use your body or whatever to get a Turkish soldier to give you a drink of water or do

1022
01:32:27.68 --> 01:32:31.52
whatever you had to do then you died on the way and the roads were littered with bodies and sometimes

1023
01:32:31.52 --> 01:32:35.76
they would just massacre all of you along the way but the ones who got to the end would get to these

1024
01:32:35.76 --> 01:32:43.20
death camps in the Syrian desert and these routes you know it doesn't take two months to walk

1025
01:32:43.20 --> 01:32:47.68
directly in a straight line from one place to their end state and an end place in the Syrian desert

1026
01:32:47.68 --> 01:32:54.32
they would go on these winding routes sometimes and it wasn't just to drag it out so that people

1027
01:32:54.32 --> 01:32:58.08
would die of exposure and starvation they would actually bring them through different

1028
01:32:58.72 --> 01:33:05.28
Muslim villages different territories of Kurdish and Circassian tribes and when they would come

1029
01:33:05.28 --> 01:33:09.52
through a given area just like we saw here people would be waiting for them with weapons

1030
01:33:10.16 --> 01:33:15.12
and they would attack and they would rape and they would take the women that they liked away

1031
01:33:15.12 --> 01:33:21.20
as sex slaves they would take the children away as slaves they would rob them of what they could but

1032
01:33:21.20 --> 01:33:26.56
it was only allowed for a certain period of time and very often the Turkish soldiers this is actually

1033
01:33:26.56 --> 01:33:30.32
what would happen much of the time is they would sort of organize it a little bit really like well

1034
01:33:30.32 --> 01:33:35.20
here's a really really pretty Armenian all of you want her as a sex slave well let's hold an

1035
01:33:35.20 --> 01:33:39.36
auction and then the Turkish soldiers get paid oh well you know we're gonna get a lot of the most

1036
01:33:39.36 --> 01:33:45.04
valuable things that they have and so the Turkish soldiers were getting paid it was a way of

1037
01:33:45.04 --> 01:33:50.48
sort of it was a very crude and brutal form of wealth redistribution in a way everything that these

1038
01:33:50.48 --> 01:33:55.20
Armenians had they were being walked around to these different villages and territories so that

1039
01:33:55.20 --> 01:34:02.40
each of the people in those places got their cut and there would be almost you read accounts where

1040
01:34:02.40 --> 01:34:07.04
it's almost like there's a sense of expectancy almost like a party atmosphere when people know

1041
01:34:07.04 --> 01:34:14.64
another care of ants coming through what are we gonna get this time and um all of these these

1042
01:34:14.64 --> 01:34:21.20
Kurdish tribes a lot of these Islamic villages there were Armenian women and children

1043
01:34:22.40 --> 01:34:26.72
tons of them in a lot of these places a lot of them would just be taken sometimes it slaves

1044
01:34:26.72 --> 01:34:30.80
and when the novelty wore off after a few weeks or a few months they would just be murdered or turned

1045
01:34:30.80 --> 01:34:36.88
turned away out in the desert to go to go wander and die um that then the other thing that's

1046
01:34:36.88 --> 01:34:41.36
happening when they're doing that is that the state is taking well they're taking the opposite

1047
01:34:41.36 --> 01:34:47.28
approach that the the Nazis took right which is that they are making all of these people

1048
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.92
complicit in this atrocity that the state is carrying out and it really does bind them together in

1049
01:34:53.92 --> 01:34:59.76
the same kind of way that you know you know like in a mafia movie where you do a hit and all three of us

1050
01:34:59.76 --> 01:35:05.04
who did it have to fire a shot to the body because we're all in this together now and it's uh

1051
01:35:05.04 --> 01:35:12.40
you know this this shared knowledge that we have all participated in this tremendous crime

1052
01:35:12.40 --> 01:35:16.88
that even going forward that can bind people together in a certain way especially we've all benefited

1053
01:35:16.88 --> 01:35:22.08
from it we've taken slaves from it we've we've robbed and maybe the things in our house right now

1054
01:35:22.08 --> 01:35:28.16
the furniture in our house right now maybe uh we're things that we that we took from these people when we

1055
01:35:28.16 --> 01:35:36.48
killed them and um that's how it went over and over and over and over again you know and the

1056
01:35:36.48 --> 01:35:43.36
thing that always the thing that is just the most unbearable to me is imagining like just I've

1057
01:35:43.36 --> 01:35:46.96
mentioned it a few times already but it's the it's always the thing I can't get out of my head about this

1058
01:35:46.96 --> 01:35:51.76
is that these are all women children old people the men were gone already and just imagining like

1059
01:35:51.76 --> 01:35:59.28
your mother or your wife or your sisters or your kids being marched along out to the desert but

1060
01:35:59.28 --> 01:36:06.08
these people set up on you know not blown up by a predator drone as bad as that it is they are being

1061
01:36:06.08 --> 01:36:12.56
hacked down with machetes and axes and as you saw like in one of the one I think the

1062
01:36:12.56 --> 01:36:18.08
onker eggs and apple that you read in in massacres that would take hours and hours and hours

1063
01:36:18.08 --> 01:36:22.80
you know it takes a long time some of these they're killing 6, 7, 8,000 people at a time in a ravine

1064
01:36:22.80 --> 01:36:33.76
by hand and that takes time and so it's just screaming in the smell of feces and blood and people

1065
01:36:33.76 --> 01:36:38.88
you know you have just body parts hacked up over here and over there there's just a big rape or

1066
01:36:38.88 --> 01:36:43.60
G and it's all right next to each other while over here they're searching your mother's pockets

1067
01:36:43.60 --> 01:36:49.36
for any gold coin she might have and it's and it's that first far as you can see there are times

1068
01:36:49.36 --> 01:36:55.68
where they did you know one instance where they did 6400 people was was the consensus estimate on it

1069
01:36:55.68 --> 01:37:00.48
and it was the entire ravine I mean you come over this ridge and it's just this entire ravine

1070
01:37:00.72 --> 01:37:06.72
hundreds of yards and it is just bodies and they're not dead of you know this this place was

1071
01:37:07.28 --> 01:37:12.48
was witnessed by an American from somebody from the American consulate who wrote out and saw it

1072
01:37:12.48 --> 01:37:18.96
afterwards these bodies are not people who died of starvation or thirst or exposure these are people

1073
01:37:18.96 --> 01:37:25.60
who's are just one big mass of gashes and mutilation and hacked off limbs and women with their

1074
01:37:25.60 --> 01:37:31.28
heads cut off who are laying there with their dresses thrown up over their head and their legs spread

1075
01:37:31.28 --> 01:37:35.44
with their heads cut off I mean that this is the these are the scenes that you see over and over and

1076
01:37:35.44 --> 01:37:40.48
over and over to the point where you know you read a book like the 30 year genocide about it where

1077
01:37:40.48 --> 01:37:45.36
he really does take the time to get into each of the massacres and it becomes almost significantly

1078
01:37:46.24 --> 01:37:55.12
nauseatingly boring in a way and it's just it's hard to imagine when you make it personal like that

1079
01:37:55.68 --> 01:38:02.48
you know trying to imagine the helplessness that you would feel knowing that this had happened

1080
01:38:02.48 --> 01:38:12.24
to people that you cared about or being one of those people it would just it's it's hard to imagine

1081
01:38:12.24 --> 01:38:18.96
well we don't necessarily just have to imagine it we can listen to when I witness

1082
01:38:20.32 --> 01:38:25.92
the widow I witnessed this is going back to the book this is transmitted by an American ambassador

1083
01:38:25.92 --> 01:38:32.72
to the secretary state says this a week before anything was done to bayboard the villages all

1084
01:38:32.72 --> 01:38:39.36
around had been emptied and their inhabitants had become victims of the John Darm's and margarine bands

1085
01:38:41.44 --> 01:38:48.96
three days before the starting of the Armenians from bayboard after a week's prison imprisonment

1086
01:38:48.96 --> 01:38:56.000
our bishop had been hanged with seven other notables after these hangings seven or eight other notables

1087
01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:02.16
were killed in their own houses for refusing to go out of the city 70 or 80 other Armenians after

1088
01:39:02.16 --> 01:39:07.52
being beaten in prison were taken to the woods and killed the Armenian population of bayboard was

1089
01:39:07.52 --> 01:39:14.64
sent off in three batches I was among the third batch my husband died eight years ago leaving me

1090
01:39:14.64 --> 01:39:20.08
and my eight year old daughter and my mother extensive possessions so that we could so that we were

1091
01:39:20.08 --> 01:39:27.52
living in comfort since mobilization began the merch has come common don has been living in my house

1092
01:39:27.52 --> 01:39:33.36
free of rent he told me not to go but I felt I must share my the fate of my people

1093
01:39:34.64 --> 01:39:39.44
I took three horses with me loaded with provisions my daughter had some five

1094
01:39:39.44 --> 01:39:44.96
lira pieces around her neck and I carried some 20 liras and four diamond rings on my person all

1095
01:39:44.96 --> 01:39:52.56
else that we had was left behind our party left June 1st 15 gen darm's going with us the party

1096
01:39:52.56 --> 01:39:59.52
numbered four five hundred persons we had got only two hours away from home when bands of villagers

1097
01:39:59.52 --> 01:40:08.48
in large numbers with rifles guns axes etc surrounded us on the road and robbers of all we had

1098
01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:15.28
the jondarms took my three horses and sold them to local Muslims pocketing the money they took

1099
01:40:15.28 --> 01:40:23.36
my money and that from my daughter's neck also all our food after this they separated the man

1100
01:40:23.36 --> 01:40:28.96
one by one and shop them all within six or seven days every mail above 15 years old

1101
01:40:31.36 --> 01:40:36.56
by my side we're killed two priests one of them over 90 years of age

1102
01:40:40.32 --> 01:40:44.72
these bandsmen took all the good looking women and carried them off on their horses

1103
01:40:46.96 --> 01:40:51.68
very many women and girls with us carried off into the mountains among them my sister

1104
01:40:51.68 --> 01:40:57.20
whose one year old baby they threw away a turk picked it up and carried it off I know not where

1105
01:41:00.64 --> 01:41:06.64
my mother walked till she could walk no further and dropped by the roads I don't a mountain top

1106
01:41:06.64 --> 01:41:11.68
we found on the road many of those who had been in previous sections carried from bayboard

1107
01:41:11.68 --> 01:41:16.16
some women among them were killed and their husbands and sons

1108
01:41:16.16 --> 01:41:24.000
we came across some old people little infants still alive but in a pitiful condition

1109
01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:30.96
having shouted their voices away we were not allowed to sleep at night in the villages but

1110
01:41:30.96 --> 01:41:36.96
lay down outside under cover of the night indescribable deeds were committed by the jondarms

1111
01:41:37.68 --> 01:41:44.96
bandsmen and villagers many of us died from hunger and strokes others were left by the roadside

1112
01:41:44.96 --> 01:41:53.60
two people to go on one morning we saw 50 to six see wagons with about 30 turkish widows whose

1113
01:41:53.60 --> 01:41:58.08
huntsbidden had been killed in the war and these were going to Constantinople

1114
01:42:00.08 --> 01:42:06.48
one of these women made a sign to one of the jondarms to kill a certain Armenian whom she pointed out

1115
01:42:06.48 --> 01:42:12.08
the jondarms asked if she did not wish to kill him herself at which she said why not

1116
01:42:12.08 --> 01:42:21.76
and drawing a revolver from her pocket shot and killed him each one of these turkish

1117
01:42:21.76 --> 01:42:28.24
hanooms which is a turkish lady had five or six Armenian girls of ten or under with her

1118
01:42:28.24 --> 01:42:31.76
boys the turk's never wish to take they killed all of whatever age

1119
01:42:31.76 --> 01:42:41.28
the worst and most unimaginable horrors were reserved for us at the banks of the year fradies

1120
01:42:43.60 --> 01:42:48.32
the mutilated bodies of women girls and little children made everybody shudder

1121
01:42:51.92 --> 01:42:57.20
the bandsmen were doing all sorts of awful deeds to the women and girls that were with us

1122
01:42:57.20 --> 01:43:05.92
whose cries went up to heaven at the fradies the bandsmen and jondarms threw into the river

1123
01:43:05.92 --> 01:43:11.36
all the remaining children under 15 years old those that could swim were shot down as they struggled

1124
01:43:11.36 --> 01:43:25.04
in the water after seven days we reached Erzingian not an Armenian was left alive there the

1125
01:43:25.04 --> 01:43:32.48
turkish women took my daughter and me to the bath and their showed us many other women and

1126
01:43:32.48 --> 01:43:42.48
girls that had accepted Islam between there and andrays the fields and hillside were dotted

1127
01:43:42.48 --> 01:43:47.12
with swollen and black and corpses that filled and fouled the air with their stench

1128
01:43:47.12 --> 01:44:00.40
on this road we met six women wearing the ferage and with children in their arms

1129
01:44:02.32 --> 01:44:07.28
but when the jondarms lifted their veils they found that they were men in disguise so they shot them

1130
01:44:07.28 --> 01:44:17.20
after thirty two days journey we reached Constantinople

1131
01:44:21.60 --> 01:44:29.20
one of the things that would happen on the trail of tears on this road to death

1132
01:44:29.20 --> 01:44:35.92
was you know by the time you got a week out of any of these cities where people were deported

1133
01:44:37.36 --> 01:44:41.20
a lot of the american consulate people and other diplomats and missionaries who were there

1134
01:44:41.20 --> 01:44:44.80
including by the way this is really worth mentioning that i've been brought up yet a lot of the people

1135
01:44:44.80 --> 01:44:50.08
diplomats who have reported on this and broke back about it and have provided a lot of material we

1136
01:44:50.08 --> 01:44:55.12
have today these are German diplomats austrian diplomats these are people who are allied to the

1137
01:44:55.12 --> 01:44:59.52
Ottoman Empire in this war who were writing back about a lot of these things there's one memoir

1138
01:44:59.52 --> 01:45:05.04
that was written about it by a guy named rafael denogales who was a venezuelin mercenary who was

1139
01:45:05.04 --> 01:45:11.36
actually serving as a turkit as a mercenary officer as a major in the turkish military and he wrote

1140
01:45:11.36 --> 01:45:18.000
a lot about it as well and one of the things that you hear over and over again is how by the time

1141
01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:22.56
you're a week out of the city all these people are naked all their clothes have been taken so they're

1142
01:45:22.56 --> 01:45:31.92
walking in july or august maybe in the Syrian desert 12 hours a day or more you know and they're

1143
01:45:31.92 --> 01:45:36.48
just blistered up from the sun they don't have any food they don't have any water anything they

1144
01:45:36.48 --> 01:45:42.08
can scrounge from the landscape or bag of some or prostitute from some turkish soldier or something

1145
01:45:42.08 --> 01:45:46.000
that's all they got something maybe they were able to hide away on their person and so they're

1146
01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:51.84
wasting away naked in the sun and then they would stop at night and you think maybe they would

1147
01:45:51.84 --> 01:45:57.36
get some rest but more often than not the nighttime was the worst time because they would stop for the

1148
01:45:57.36 --> 01:46:03.52
evening and as ever they didn't have tens most of the time those would all would have

1149
01:46:03.52 --> 01:46:06.72
all been taken from them they didn't have any kind of shelter so they're just sitting out

1150
01:46:06.72 --> 01:46:13.44
in the weather and if there was a village nearby or a tribe nearby or sometimes just the soldiers

1151
01:46:13.44 --> 01:46:18.32
themselves this was their time to blow off a little bit of steam and so they would show up and they

1152
01:46:18.32 --> 01:46:23.36
would just be walking through the encampments of all of these women and children and elderly people who

1153
01:46:23.36 --> 01:46:29.60
who stopped and they would just take their pick for rape they would take slaves sometimes they

1154
01:46:29.60 --> 01:46:36.72
would just torture people for entertainment their stories of pretty Armenian women being

1155
01:46:36.72 --> 01:46:41.12
strip naked and forced to dance for turkish soldiers and when they weren't pleased with their

1156
01:46:41.12 --> 01:46:46.32
performance they just doubted the encarricine and watched the veranda death for their entertainment

1157
01:46:46.32 --> 01:46:52.56
there's story after story after story after story like this and not a bunch of people from

1158
01:46:52.56 --> 01:46:58.32
one caravan we're talking from all over the country throughout the entire period of this going on

1159
01:46:58.32 --> 01:47:05.44
there's something you know there's maybe you can get people to go put a bullet in somebody's head

1160
01:47:06.16 --> 01:47:12.24
for their country you can maybe play play up that angle of it to get them to do something like that

1161
01:47:12.24 --> 01:47:22.000
you've got a really in general level of extraordinary hatred I think to to get people to do some

1162
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:27.44
of the things that were being done here especially the regular people that doesn't go so much for

1163
01:47:27.44 --> 01:47:34.48
the special organization you know I think I think maybe in one of the unraveling episodes we did I

1164
01:47:35.12 --> 01:47:41.52
asked a question like if you had a bar in town in any city in America where everybody knew that's the bar

1165
01:47:41.52 --> 01:47:45.68
where in there there's this room and there's a person in there and you can just do whatever you want to

1166
01:47:45.68 --> 01:47:50.16
that's the gimmick at the bar like I might not go there you guys might not go there but I don't think

1167
01:47:50.16 --> 01:47:55.68
it would be empty I think it would rarely be empty and when you're talking about okay what if you had

1168
01:47:55.68 --> 01:48:01.68
that in a prison that would be a lively joint I mean that's what you had going on here you had these

1169
01:48:01.68 --> 01:48:07.92
caravans of women children and old people being marched down into the desert very often by

1170
01:48:07.92 --> 01:48:15.28
guards who were from the special organization guys who were convicted murderers and rapists

1171
01:48:15.28 --> 01:48:19.28
who had been given complete in total license from their government to do whatever they want and

1172
01:48:19.28 --> 01:48:25.04
now you stop at nighttime and your board you've been on the road for a week riding in the hot

1173
01:48:25.04 --> 01:48:31.76
sun on your horse guarding these people and what are you how you're going to spend your evening

1174
01:48:31.76 --> 01:48:37.28
and the way a lot of them spent it was just you know again you just it's one of those things that

1175
01:48:37.28 --> 01:48:43.12
like reading a book about it or anything just you really can't do justice until you really try

1176
01:48:43.12 --> 01:48:47.52
just close your eyes and try to put yourself in the position of these people in the position of

1177
01:48:47.52 --> 01:48:55.04
a mother who's already watched two of her children die of exposure and then has her baby grab

1178
01:48:55.04 --> 01:49:00.40
by a leg and thrown in a river and then she's gang raped and she's going to be gang raped again

1179
01:49:00.40 --> 01:49:06.48
and again and again for the next two months as she walks you know this road or until she can't take

1180
01:49:06.48 --> 01:49:15.84
it anymore and commit suicide basically that was the situation of hundreds of thousands of people

1181
01:49:15.84 --> 01:49:21.76
being marched down into the desert like this well you said story after story after story

1182
01:49:25.84 --> 01:49:30.56
here's some of them going back to the book and you mentioned the German diplomats

1183
01:49:31.12 --> 01:49:36.08
here's a German diplomat the teachers of the American school and car per were gruesome

1184
01:49:36.08 --> 01:49:44.08
torture before they were killed two professors had their hair and beard ripped out while in prison

1185
01:49:44.64 --> 01:49:49.44
in order to extort confessions and were hung by their hands for days at a time

1186
01:49:52.40 --> 01:49:58.16
another professor went insane when he was forced to watch Armenians being beaten to death

1187
01:49:58.16 --> 01:50:01.76
the governor himself took part in the torture of another professor

1188
01:50:01.76 --> 01:50:09.44
the senior executive president beat him until he was exhausted and said whoever loves his

1189
01:50:09.44 --> 01:50:12.48
religion and his people may continue beating

1190
01:50:17.12 --> 01:50:23.28
here's another eyewitness who was seven years old at the time we heard afterward that together with

1191
01:50:23.28 --> 01:50:29.28
17 other Armenian young men they had mastered them by night and had thrown them under the bridge

1192
01:50:29.28 --> 01:50:39.12
thus when we were deported there were no males left in our family they took away my five

1193
01:50:39.12 --> 01:50:47.84
aunts in der Zor later they cut their off their heads impaled their heads with their banats to show

1194
01:50:47.84 --> 01:50:52.40
them to us and then they threw their corpses in the yearfraidies

1195
01:50:52.40 --> 01:51:04.64
we found only half the body of my mother's aunt my mother buried her in the earth here's a

1196
01:51:04.64 --> 01:51:13.44
13 year old eyewitness the Turks came and drove us all out of the village they were forcing

1197
01:51:13.44 --> 01:51:20.000
us to march with whip strokes they tied our hands behind us they disrobed us totally and we stood

1198
01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:27.60
naked as the day we were born then they broke once hand another's arm still another's leg

1199
01:51:27.60 --> 01:51:37.52
with axes and daggers behind us a little boy whose arm was broken was crying and calling for

1200
01:51:37.52 --> 01:51:47.84
his mother but the mother had already died by an axe they came in the morning assembled us

1201
01:51:47.84 --> 01:51:54.80
and started once more to kill and drop the bodies in the water below the cave the river

1202
01:51:54.80 --> 01:52:00.80
cover was flowing they caught someone's head another's leg still another's hand and all these

1203
01:52:00.80 --> 01:52:10.96
human parts were piled up upon one another on the ground some were not yet dead but had their

1204
01:52:10.96 --> 01:52:19.04
bone shattered and their hands severed some were crying others squeaking there was the odor of blood

1205
01:52:19.04 --> 01:52:30.80
on the hand and hunger on the other people who were still alive started to eat the flesh of the dead

1206
01:52:30.80 --> 01:52:47.68
one of the effects of this was a very strange demographic dynamic that happened in Turkey in

1207
01:52:47.68 --> 01:52:53.12
the years afterwards it was actually a book that came out it was in the 2000s or the 90s when it

1208
01:52:53.12 --> 01:52:59.36
actually came out must have been the 2000s was written by a Turkish woman living in in Istanbul now

1209
01:52:59.36 --> 01:53:07.76
her grandmother pulled her aside when she was very old and told her her life story and it turned out

1210
01:53:07.76 --> 01:53:13.20
her grandmother was an Armenian and she had been taken as a small girl away we mentioned earlier one

1211
01:53:13.20 --> 01:53:20.48
of the one of the Turkish women who were heading back to Constantinople with a stable of 678

1212
01:53:20.48 --> 01:53:24.48
little Armenian girls and they were taking them back to be their house servants and that's how her

1213
01:53:24.48 --> 01:53:30.16
grandmother was taken she was taken back into a house she ended up in a place that was pretty civilized

1214
01:53:30.16 --> 01:53:35.20
they pretty much just raised her you know she was kind of a servant but they didn't abuse her or

1215
01:53:35.20 --> 01:53:39.36
anything and so she was raised in this house and became Turkish she remembered who she was but

1216
01:53:40.80 --> 01:53:45.68
everybody thought she was a Turk her granddaughter thought she was a Turk and so after she told her

1217
01:53:45.68 --> 01:53:51.28
granddaughter her life story she wrote the she wrote the she wrote the book and it was kind of a sensation

1218
01:53:51.28 --> 01:53:57.92
and Turkey because to this day Turkey still denies the genocide and so something that they

1219
01:53:59.12 --> 01:54:04.88
well we'll talk about that a little bit but that aspect of it the taking of children and women

1220
01:54:04.88 --> 01:54:12.16
the mass enslavement of these people was it was a huge section it's almost gosh man you would almost

1221
01:54:12.16 --> 01:54:19.76
think that like it almost seems like a fake worst in death the people who have killed your husband

1222
01:54:19.76 --> 01:54:26.40
your parents your kids your entire community your entire people and now they're gonna take you as a

1223
01:54:26.40 --> 01:54:30.64
slave most of the most often when you're talking about the women they're being taken away as sex slaves

1224
01:54:31.20 --> 01:54:35.76
and very often they're being taken away not by not that this would make and I guess any better but

1225
01:54:35.76 --> 01:54:40.48
they're not being taken away by some Turkish notable to go be in his haram in Constantinople they're

1226
01:54:40.48 --> 01:54:48.24
being taken away by some some tribesmen out until his tent in the desert and that's where she's

1227
01:54:48.24 --> 01:54:52.80
gonna live now until they get tired of her and it's maybe not just for him you know a lot of

1228
01:54:52.80 --> 01:54:58.16
times these were women who would be kept to be shared with friends and companies like a matter of

1229
01:54:58.16 --> 01:55:04.96
hospitality you know this kind of thing was going on and you're talking about oh gosh I mean it's

1230
01:55:04.96 --> 01:55:10.000
hard to really say but you're talking tens of thousands at least of our menian women and children

1231
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:15.04
taking away this way you know maybe a hundred maybe over a hundred thousand the total number of deaths

1232
01:55:15.04 --> 01:55:20.08
between one one point five million but the number of people who were taken away is slaves and just

1233
01:55:20.08 --> 01:55:24.88
kind of melted into the population or were murdered later that's what happened to a lot of these people it was

1234
01:55:24.88 --> 01:55:30.56
it was in the ten at least the tens of thousands you know sex slavery in the Ottoman Empire that

1235
01:55:30.56 --> 01:55:35.92
this isn't something that just sort of came out of nowhere because of the chaos it was going on

1236
01:55:35.92 --> 01:55:39.76
there was actually just last night as I was brushing up on some of this I came across in New York

1237
01:55:39.76 --> 01:55:48.80
times article written in 1886 by a journalist who managed to he had a he had a guide there in

1238
01:55:48.80 --> 01:55:52.56
Constantinople that was helping them and they dressed him up in a beard and said he looked like

1239
01:55:52.56 --> 01:55:56.64
you know he was from the area and he had some money and they got him into some of these places

1240
01:55:56.64 --> 01:56:01.36
where they were selling women and this was in 1886 none of this was going on and they would

1241
01:56:01.36 --> 01:56:05.68
they were mostly so there's always Christian women usually you're not you can't enslaved

1242
01:56:05.68 --> 01:56:09.44
Muslims sometimes you know people do what they do but generally speaking that's what happened and

1243
01:56:09.44 --> 01:56:14.72
so it would be Circassians and Slavs and Armenians and sometimes a series of Greeks

1244
01:56:16.56 --> 01:56:22.56
and so this was something that you know that the Sultan himself the way the Sultan reproduced was

1245
01:56:23.28 --> 01:56:28.88
he had a harem of hundreds and hundreds of women and all of them were slaves taken from Christian lands

1246
01:56:29.52 --> 01:56:34.72
and they would be kept in a cell in like a very specific part of the palace and they would be guarded

1247
01:56:34.72 --> 01:56:41.92
by black like black African unix and so I mean just again give you some idea of like the

1248
01:56:41.92 --> 01:56:48.48
society we're talking about here the king has hundreds of slave women kept in cells and like his

1249
01:56:48.48 --> 01:56:51.68
own palace they're not allowed to interact with anybody else and they're guarded with

1250
01:56:52.48 --> 01:56:57.12
they're guarded by unix who were castrated specifically for the purpose I mean this is a

1251
01:56:57.12 --> 01:57:02.16
it's a different we're not talking about you know the abundance dog or the English parliament or

1252
01:57:02.16 --> 01:57:06.16
something it's just a different different time in a different place I mean we do after remember that

1253
01:57:06.88 --> 01:57:11.84
you know we're I just mentioned that New York Times article in 1886 it only 21 years before

1254
01:57:11.84 --> 01:57:16.24
was when we got rid of you know Chatelle slavery in the United States so it was a different time and

1255
01:57:16.24 --> 01:57:20.48
there were a lot of things going on back then but there's a there's a little bit of exotic

1256
01:57:20.48 --> 01:57:25.44
strangeness to something like that that I think kind of shocks us a little bit and this idea that

1257
01:57:25.44 --> 01:57:32.24
you know you could take especially non-Islamic women as spoils of war and a sex slavery we saw

1258
01:57:32.24 --> 01:57:36.88
that reignite when ISIS you know rampaged through everywhere they were taken to Yazidis and

1259
01:57:36.88 --> 01:57:42.16
everybody else that they found it wasn't Muslim as sex slaves and it was horrifying to us but

1260
01:57:42.16 --> 01:57:46.48
you know in this part of the world especially when you get out into the countryside where things

1261
01:57:46.48 --> 01:57:54.64
don't change much very rapidly this was something that was not a huge diversion from what was normal

1262
01:57:54.64 --> 01:58:01.04
for people and so once there was the opportunity it just happened at scale and you had tens of

1263
01:58:01.04 --> 01:58:04.80
thousands again maybe over a hundred thousand Armenian women and children who just disappeared into

1264
01:58:04.80 --> 01:58:14.80
Kurdish villages and into Turkish homes set us up for a daresor yeah daresor was one of the main

1265
01:58:16.48 --> 01:58:21.12
gosh what do you even call a place like that you want to call it a death camp but that sort of

1266
01:58:21.12 --> 01:58:26.40
makes you think of the Nazi example where this is like a factory of death and it wasn't it wasn't that

1267
01:58:27.60 --> 01:58:32.16
you had these these caravans that were being wound through the desert to be robbed and raped and

1268
01:58:32.16 --> 01:58:39.12
killed and enslaved as they went and just eyewitness report after eyewitness report describes the

1269
01:58:39.12 --> 01:58:44.24
road on the way down is just littered with corpses and body parts everywhere you go anytime there's a

1270
01:58:44.24 --> 01:58:48.96
hill you look over the other side of it off the road and it's just filled with bodies back there

1271
01:58:48.96 --> 01:58:55.20
the rivers are choked with bodies and body parts but some of the people survived some of the people

1272
01:58:55.20 --> 01:59:00.72
just figured it out you just said people who were alive started to eat the flesh of the dead people who

1273
01:59:00.72 --> 01:59:07.68
haven't had anything to eat for a month will do you lose your mind when you start to when you

1274
01:59:07.68 --> 01:59:14.48
start to starve and die of thirst and exposure and some people made it and for those who made it

1275
01:59:14.48 --> 01:59:24.64
tell was waiting for them you know at the place that they got to at the end of the line one of them

1276
01:59:24.64 --> 01:59:34.000
called their Zor is basically big open air cages that they just pen people up in and there was

1277
01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:39.44
no food and there was no water and there was no medicine and they just stayed in there and they died

1278
01:59:39.44 --> 01:59:46.72
and now you know this wasn't Auschwitz with you know double razor wire fences you know multiple layers

1279
01:59:46.72 --> 01:59:52.64
deep people could kind of get there and you know if you had an ability to do if you knew somebody

1280
01:59:52.64 --> 01:59:57.04
who maybe came down there to give you a blanket or some food you might live a little bit longer than

1281
01:59:57.04 --> 02:00:03.04
everybody else but people were dying by the 500 the thousands the 2000s a day just dying of disease

1282
02:00:03.04 --> 02:00:11.12
and exposure and hunger and thirst and periodically massacre sometimes when another caravan would

1283
02:00:11.12 --> 02:00:15.12
get there and they're just simply wasn't any room for anyone else they would either take that

1284
02:00:15.12 --> 02:00:19.92
caravan or most often they would take people who were already degraded near the point of death

1285
02:00:19.92 --> 02:00:24.000
and they would be like well we're moving you to the next location you're going south again

1286
02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.96
everybody back on the road and there was nothing south they just marched them out there people who

1287
02:00:28.96 --> 02:00:32.48
were already right on the point of death they would march them further into the Syrian desert

1288
02:00:32.48 --> 02:00:39.84
they would just wander out there and die or be massacred the scenes in derseor that are described

1289
02:00:39.84 --> 02:00:43.92
or really something beyond I mean it's a heronum is Bosch painting you know

1290
02:00:47.76 --> 02:00:56.16
this is from the book no pen can possibly convey the suffering and misery of these exile

1291
02:00:56.16 --> 02:01:03.12
Armenians persecuted wanders surrounded by savage gangs of police soldiers riding in thousands of

1292
02:01:03.12 --> 02:01:10.56
wagons and carts and on beasts of burden though most were on foot and many of those bear

1293
02:01:13.28 --> 02:01:18.08
like dried leaves driven by the wind they passed through this sold bloody passage

1294
02:01:18.08 --> 02:01:27.20
and on to the arid deserts of derseor to die without bread without water without a shroud

1295
02:01:27.20 --> 02:01:34.24
and without a grave barely had the men from these regions been separated from the women

1296
02:01:34.24 --> 02:01:39.44
and put on the road to exile when they were mercifully slaughtered and their corpses thrown

1297
02:01:39.44 --> 02:01:43.12
into the rivers or valleys as food for vultures and other wild animals

1298
02:01:43.12 --> 02:01:50.48
the young brides and virgins were yanked from the embrace of their crying mothers

1299
02:01:51.68 --> 02:02:02.80
and taken to Turkish herems even ten year old girls were subjected to all manner of savage

1300
02:02:02.80 --> 02:02:12.24
unbearable debotuary the older women who managed to endure the terrible hardships of the road

1301
02:02:12.24 --> 02:02:18.08
were taken to derseor where they were brutally slaughtered during the summer of 1916

1302
02:02:21.12 --> 02:02:26.72
here we encounter two young Armenian engineers who had been in charge with overseeing the work of an

1303
02:02:26.72 --> 02:02:34.80
Armenian labor battalion in tears they told me how in 1915 particularly in September and October

1304
02:02:34.80 --> 02:02:41.12
approximately 80,000 Armenians of both sexes were encamped under tents made from bedsheets and

1305
02:02:41.12 --> 02:02:47.36
rags on the plain near the valley stretching all the way to the spacious swampy field by the

1306
02:02:47.36 --> 02:02:49.28
Mamure Railway Station

1307
02:02:51.60 --> 02:02:58.16
600 to 700 were dying daily from hunger thirst and fever when suddenly a lengthy

1308
02:02:58.16 --> 02:03:04.24
nocturnal autumn rain came and finished the task left unfinished by the human beasts

1309
02:03:04.24 --> 02:03:12.32
the people were stuck in the standing pools of water for several days severe cold

1310
02:03:12.32 --> 02:03:16.72
insert ensued and none of them had adequate shelter clothing or food

1311
02:03:20.48 --> 02:03:25.52
they froze to death by the thousands falling like the autumn leaves or they died from

1312
02:03:25.52 --> 02:03:34.56
dysentery diarrhea bleeding and other plagues of overcrowding the field was soon covered with

1313
02:03:34.56 --> 02:03:40.72
mounds of unbearied bodies under makeshift tents and entire families were reduced to corpses

1314
02:03:40.72 --> 02:03:49.20
by hunger and cold with no one to bury them nor could those Armenians who found their dead

1315
02:03:49.20 --> 02:03:59.12
kinfolk find any spades or hose to bury them with and behold suddenly one morning

1316
02:03:59.12 --> 02:04:06.40
to bring this widespread and heart-trending wretchedness to its ultimate perfection the director of

1317
02:04:06.40 --> 02:04:12.16
the exiled caravans and hundreds of police soldiers bearing whips and clubs surrounded the poor

1318
02:04:12.16 --> 02:04:17.60
people already at death store and ordered them to get immediately on the road it isn't

1319
02:04:17.60 --> 02:04:23.12
humanly possible to imagine the hue and cry the begging and pleading and the chaos that

1320
02:04:23.12 --> 02:04:29.12
prevailed in and around those thousands of tents the tents were then taken down and the portable

1321
02:04:29.12 --> 02:04:34.40
goods and bundles representing the deportees last bits of property were assembled but they had

1322
02:04:34.40 --> 02:04:40.72
neither carts nor wagons nor beasts of burden to carry them the lamentation then began

1323
02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.80
many would not leave loved ones who were sick in their death throws lying on the ground

1324
02:04:46.80 --> 02:04:53.60
uncaired for and abandoned the dying agast beg not to be abandoned in the open fields as food

1325
02:04:53.60 --> 02:05:02.000
for hungry wolves and corpse eating hyenas that prowled the night but they had no time to think

1326
02:05:03.36 --> 02:05:09.52
the military police and major and minor officials fell upon them without pity or human feeling they

1327
02:05:09.52 --> 02:05:15.44
struck the hapless and confused left and right hitting them everywhere eyes burst open

1328
02:05:15.44 --> 02:05:21.52
skulls were crushed faces were covered with blood and new wounds were opened up nobody cared

1329
02:05:21.52 --> 02:05:30.80
nobody took pity on them the survivors seeing that they had no option but to leave

1330
02:05:30.80 --> 02:05:36.72
took down and folded thousands of tents and in an instant throwing them over their shoulders

1331
02:05:36.72 --> 02:05:40.24
got on the road leaving their ill and dying loved ones behind

1332
02:05:40.24 --> 02:05:50.08
the wretched Armenian mothers who unable to take their underage children two to six years old

1333
02:05:50.08 --> 02:05:55.60
children who had fallen ill from starvation extreme cold and the hardship of the long road

1334
02:05:55.60 --> 02:06:00.24
half dead or in the throws of death had to leave them on top of the already dead

1335
02:06:00.24 --> 02:06:10.64
tearfully the eyewitnesses told us how two large mounds of corpses of thousands of Armenian

1336
02:06:10.64 --> 02:06:17.76
children rose up among them numerous children who had not yet died and who extended their small hands

1337
02:06:17.76 --> 02:06:26.24
searching for their mothers the eyes of these omaciated and neglected angels bore a look of

1338
02:06:26.24 --> 02:06:38.80
pleading and protest directed toward their mothers and toward God and from their half dead lips

1339
02:06:38.80 --> 02:06:42.88
some of them cried that sacred word mommy for the last time

1340
02:06:48.80 --> 02:06:53.76
since their mothers could not possibly take the children along in a few hours the little ones would

1341
02:06:53.76 --> 02:06:59.92
be dead and would have to be left on the road anyway it was perhaps better that all of them

1342
02:06:59.92 --> 02:07:05.20
the offspring of the same wretched and persecuted nation lay down in heaps in one place

1343
02:07:05.20 --> 02:07:10.32
maybe God and men would finally have pity and see that this was suffering enough

1344
02:07:14.08 --> 02:07:18.88
instead of half dead children mothers carried on their bosoms the weakest and most exhausted

1345
02:07:18.88 --> 02:07:28.24
of the children still alive until they too had to be abandoned the angelic souls of thousands of

1346
02:07:28.24 --> 02:07:33.92
Armenian children were rising to heaven to tell God of their beloved mothers endless sufferings and

1347
02:07:33.92 --> 02:07:43.44
misfortunes those remaining in the care vans of Armenian axiles moved on and disappeared into the

1348
02:07:43.44 --> 02:07:53.04
mountains there was an all encompassing silence as night came then the howling and yelping

1349
02:07:54.64 --> 02:08:01.28
of hungry wolves jackals and foxes and occasionally the faint screams of Armenian children

1350
02:08:01.28 --> 02:08:12.88
being eaten for the animals would eat the live ones first

1351
02:08:19.92 --> 02:08:27.52
and that that wraps up what we're going to cover from the book and and of course obviously

1352
02:08:27.52 --> 02:08:36.80
I only read a tiny percentage now to to get the book across the game some kind of

1353
02:08:36.80 --> 02:08:49.84
understanding of of what took place and I mean what what can be called for all practical purposes

1354
02:08:49.84 --> 02:09:02.32
is is I don't know if this is a thing to say but this was for the most part this was a successful

1355
02:09:02.32 --> 02:09:09.12
genocide I mean it was damn near as fully successful genocide meaning we got rid of this group of

1356
02:09:09.12 --> 02:09:17.84
people forever yes is that I mean there are Armenians in other countries obviously so the people

1357
02:09:17.84 --> 02:09:24.40
survived but there are no Armenians in Turkey today and in fact Christians in general and again

1358
02:09:24.40 --> 02:09:29.04
I don't mean to dilute the Armenian experience here but it is worth mentioning that this was something

1359
02:09:29.04 --> 02:09:34.48
the Turks were attacking Christians across the empire this period they killed 300,000 a

1360
02:09:34.48 --> 02:09:42.08
Syrian Christians they killed countless Lebanese Christians and after the war when out of Turk came

1361
02:09:42.08 --> 02:09:47.84
back and they were fighting in the west against the Greeks he killed and then killed 300,000 Greeks

1362
02:09:47.84 --> 02:09:54.16
Greek Christians and then expelled another million to a million and a half you know there were

1363
02:09:54.72 --> 02:10:02.88
three or four million Armenians in Turkey proper before the war started and when it was all over

1364
02:10:02.88 --> 02:10:09.84
by 1917 really when when the genocide kind of died down maybe tens of thousands crawled out of

1365
02:10:09.84 --> 02:10:17.20
their hiding places went from three or four million to maybe a few tens of thousands and you

1366
02:10:17.20 --> 02:10:25.68
have to call it in a way successful because from one standpoint Turkey got what it wanted there are

1367
02:10:25.68 --> 02:10:34.40
no more Christians or Armenians in our country and from you know from another angle they didn't

1368
02:10:34.40 --> 02:10:42.88
really pay for it some individuals didn't we'll get we'll get to that but you know after the

1369
02:10:42.88 --> 02:10:47.76
one of probably the great tragedy the 20th century here's another one of its consequences was

1370
02:10:47.76 --> 02:10:54.72
the Russian Revolution in 1917 the Bolshevik the communist take over Russia in 1917 and pull them out of

1371
02:10:54.72 --> 02:11:00.40
the war and so the Armenians who have been hiding behind Russian lines that's where a lot of the

1372
02:11:00.40 --> 02:11:04.88
Armenians in eastern Anatolia retreated just get behind the Russian army or the Russian army packed up and left

1373
02:11:05.44 --> 02:11:11.92
they're out of the war and so you have all of these Armenians now right up into the what we

1374
02:11:11.92 --> 02:11:18.24
consider today are a media proper the Republic of Armenia is wide open it is wide open over there and

1375
02:11:18.24 --> 02:11:25.84
there is still a Turkish army in the field that is fully prepared to finish the job and they are driving

1376
02:11:25.84 --> 02:11:32.24
up into Armenia they're driving toward the capital of Armenia yeravan talking about a Turkish army

1377
02:11:33.68 --> 02:11:38.64
tens of thousands strong a fully equipped military force world war one air military force and you've

1378
02:11:38.64 --> 02:11:45.28
got about 1200 Armenian soldiers and then you've got a bunch of refugees and older men and everything

1379
02:11:45.28 --> 02:11:51.60
else who are given guns clubs anything that they could find which is not much and they're told

1380
02:11:51.60 --> 02:11:56.72
do we flee up into Georgia up further into the Soviet Union depending on how bad this gets or

1381
02:11:59.36 --> 02:12:02.64
are we gonna we gonna make a stand here and that's what they did

1382
02:12:04.08 --> 02:12:09.44
there were people in yeravan lots and lots of refugees so it was an overcrowded place they had a lot of

1383
02:12:09.44 --> 02:12:14.24
people but they only again had about 1200 train soldiers and they were the ones that went and got

1384
02:12:14.24 --> 02:12:19.12
everybody organized they rang the bells of the church bells of yeravan to muster everybody and you had

1385
02:12:19.12 --> 02:12:23.68
women and children running supply lines everywhere getting everything in place you had men digging

1386
02:12:23.68 --> 02:12:29.04
defensive fortifications you had old men serving as like signal operators with flags and things up

1387
02:12:29.04 --> 02:12:34.56
on you know up on towers everybody was participating here and the Turkish army pushed up

1388
02:12:35.20 --> 02:12:40.40
within you know just about within visual range just over the horizon of the capital of Armenia

1389
02:12:41.04 --> 02:12:46.40
and they got to a place there were three areas where they fought but the main one that you know

1390
02:12:46.40 --> 02:12:51.44
people remember today there's a great big monument there and a great museum Armenian history museum

1391
02:12:51.44 --> 02:12:57.92
called Sardara Bot and thankfully this French guy it's not a it's not a very well-known battle

1392
02:12:57.92 --> 02:13:02.08
if you look in general histories they'll talk they'll all talk about it but they won't get much into the

1393
02:13:02.08 --> 02:13:06.000
details thankfully there was this French guy back in the 70s a historian who went back

1394
02:13:06.56 --> 02:13:11.44
into the records and he got everything I mean he's a military historian and so I read that book and

1395
02:13:11.44 --> 02:13:15.60
I mean he really gets down to like the order of battle on both sides and everything else and I mean

1396
02:13:15.60 --> 02:13:21.20
you're really talking about a fully equipped Turkish army against a rag tag group of refugees led by a few

1397
02:13:22.08 --> 02:13:26.96
trained NCOs basically and thankfully they did have some Armenian

1398
02:13:27.60 --> 02:13:31.92
Russians who once the Soviet Union pulled them out of the war they were like well

1399
02:13:31.92 --> 02:13:36.72
you know I'm a colonel in the Soviet army now I guess do I go back to Moscow or wherever they're calling

1400
02:13:36.72 --> 02:13:40.88
us or am I going to stay here in fight and so some of them stayed and helped lead the effort as well

1401
02:13:40.88 --> 02:13:46.56
and this rag tag group put a halt it's Sardara Bot to the Turkish advance and really I mean

1402
02:13:46.56 --> 02:13:51.60
there was a historian American historian not not Armenian but just a historian of the

1403
02:13:51.60 --> 02:13:57.36
Ottoman Empire who said that if they had lost that battle then the word Armenia today

1404
02:13:57.36 --> 02:14:02.80
would just be a curious historical footnote you know we'd probably still have Armenians obviously

1405
02:14:02.80 --> 02:14:07.12
just like we had Jews for a long period of time when there was no such thing as Israel but that's

1406
02:14:07.12 --> 02:14:14.48
what we would be talking about you know it didn't preserve Armenian independence at the time

1407
02:14:15.04 --> 02:14:19.44
they tried you know one of the things that happened was in that brief period after they did put a stop

1408
02:14:19.44 --> 02:14:26.08
to them Georgia Armenia and Azerbaijan which are all right there clumped together none of them

1409
02:14:26.08 --> 02:14:30.24
wanted to be part of the Soviet Union at the time and they didn't want to be part of the

1410
02:14:30.24 --> 02:14:34.64
Ottoman Empire either so they formed a little alliance to try to defend themselves but as soon as

1411
02:14:34.64 --> 02:14:39.84
things got a little bit tricky Georgia was pretty quick to be like you know what we're going to

1412
02:14:39.84 --> 02:14:44.000
go with the Soviet Union and Azerbaijan was very quick to be like you know what what Muslims too

1413
02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:48.000
and they kind of stabbed the Armenians in the back and attacked them from behind and so the

1414
02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:51.92
Armenians then at that point had to cut a deal with the Soviet Union and so Armenia became

1415
02:14:51.92 --> 02:14:58.40
a Soviet socialist republic as well and so out of the out of the frying pan into the fire there

1416
02:14:58.40 --> 02:15:03.44
you know although I mean you know the thing is one of the things that did happen in Armenia

1417
02:15:03.44 --> 02:15:08.48
obviously you know they were under the same Soviet tyranny is everybody else to some degree but they

1418
02:15:08.48 --> 02:15:13.52
did understand the Soviets even. Sanatical is they were they understood to a certain degree that these

1419
02:15:13.52 --> 02:15:21.12
people were not going to give up their national or religious identity no matter what we'd have to

1420
02:15:21.12 --> 02:15:25.92
finish the job that the Turks started if we were going to accomplish that and so they really didn't

1421
02:15:25.92 --> 02:15:30.64
push that as hard as they did in some other places which is why you know to this the Armenian church

1422
02:15:30.64 --> 02:15:35.20
was able to survive and then to this day once they achieved their independence finally in

1423
02:15:35.20 --> 02:15:40.96
you know when the Soviet Union fell everything was in place there and you know say what you want

1424
02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:48.56
about the downsides of I don't know what you would call it of nationalism or just sort of that

1425
02:15:49.20 --> 02:15:55.84
you know um I got you Armenian is one of the things that you find about them and it's something I love

1426
02:15:55.84 --> 02:16:03.04
about Armenians really like any Mediterranean peoples is Armenian's love being Armenian and it makes

1427
02:16:03.04 --> 02:16:08.40
some it makes them so much fun you know it's just to me like Armenians in America they're almost

1428
02:16:08.40 --> 02:16:16.16
a perfect immigrant group in a sense where they are they're American 100% you know you can't look at

1429
02:16:16.16 --> 02:16:21.36
the Kardashians and be like those are Americans those are Americans as much as George Washington's

1430
02:16:21.36 --> 02:16:26.72
an American you know it's just they they fully adopt and like they're down they join the military they do

1431
02:16:26.72 --> 02:16:32.88
everything and fully assimilate and integrate and yet they love Armenia and they love the Armenian

1432
02:16:32.88 --> 02:16:38.64
church and they love their people and their history and there's no tension there you know they

1433
02:16:38.64 --> 02:16:43.84
they can be fully patriotic Americans or in France there's a lot of Armenians in France for example

1434
02:16:43.84 --> 02:16:49.92
and they never lost that connection with their own history and um in their own traditions and

1435
02:16:49.92 --> 02:16:56.64
I think they they really walked out line really well um well it's um it doesn't have to be mutually

1436
02:16:56.64 --> 02:17:00.40
exclusive to be you know proud of where you're from they're proof that it was and proud of where you're

1437
02:17:00.40 --> 02:17:06.80
from yeah they're proof that it doesn't and they didn't um they also didn't really forget no they didn't

1438
02:17:06.80 --> 02:17:10.48
forget you know one of the things what had happened yeah one of the things that happened right is

1439
02:17:10.48 --> 02:17:15.04
another consequence of the Russian Revolution is you have all of the you know by the top by the end of

1440
02:17:15.04 --> 02:17:18.80
the war everybody knows what was going on in Turkey so you had the British and the Americans and

1441
02:17:18.80 --> 02:17:23.52
everybody else who were looking at the Ottoman Empire or now it's just the Republic of Turkey right

1442
02:17:23.52 --> 02:17:30.16
there's the the war in Turkey went on until 1924 the British defeated the Ottoman Empire they occupied

1443
02:17:30.16 --> 02:17:37.20
Constantinople but there was still large military force commanded by a great man there was no

1444
02:17:37.20 --> 02:17:41.36
way to put it you know he was a he was a hard man he did a lot of bad things in the field and

1445
02:17:41.36 --> 02:17:45.68
did what he had to do for his country I suppose one way to look at it but come out out of Turk the father of

1446
02:17:45.68 --> 02:17:51.44
the Turks father of the modern Turkish Republic he was in command he was in he was he was a hero

1447
02:17:51.44 --> 02:17:56.96
at Gallipoli the man who out of fight knew how to command very smart very tough and he was still

1448
02:17:56.96 --> 02:18:02.08
out there and so he moved the capital from Constantinople where the British had established themselves

1449
02:18:02.08 --> 02:18:07.92
out to Ankara where it is now and he kept fighting you know he um it first was pushing up into the

1450
02:18:07.92 --> 02:18:13.92
caucuses to you know with the idea that if you get past Armenian Georgia and you keep going northeast

1451
02:18:13.92 --> 02:18:19.12
there it's just Turkic peoples like all the way over to western China at that point so there was

1452
02:18:19.12 --> 02:18:24.000
this like pan Turkish idea that maybe okay we lost all the North African whatever but maybe

1453
02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:27.28
you know the Arabs were always kind of trouble anyway why were we doing that maybe this is the

1454
02:18:27.28 --> 02:18:32.80
empire this pan Turkish Empire the Armenians it's so darabat put a stock to that and then the Soviet

1455
02:18:32.80 --> 02:18:37.20
Union established itself so that wasn't going to work out and so they retreated back and eventually

1456
02:18:37.20 --> 02:18:42.24
they went back and pushed everybody else out of their country and um established the modern

1457
02:18:42.24 --> 02:18:48.32
Republic of Turkey and Kamal Atturk was he was a young Turk he was a member of the young Turks

1458
02:18:48.32 --> 02:18:55.04
um he had broken with the triumph or a little bit uh over you know military reasons over the years

1459
02:18:55.04 --> 02:18:58.16
but he was still part of these people and a lot of the young Turks and even the committee of

1460
02:18:58.16 --> 02:19:02.96
Union and progress the core group that was really carrying all this out they were still there they

1461
02:19:02.96 --> 02:19:08.000
were still in the government you know there was no real we had denotsification after the second

1462
02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:13.04
World War and there was really not a whole lot of that going on some of the very very main people

1463
02:19:13.76 --> 02:19:18.80
you know they fled they they fled the country and so this wasn't carried out but they were tried

1464
02:19:18.80 --> 02:19:25.28
in absentia some of them were sentenced to death some of the main architects um but after a little while

1465
02:19:25.28 --> 02:19:30.24
everybody realized that Turkey is going to be kind of strategically important now that we have this huge

1466
02:19:30.24 --> 02:19:36.24
threat of the Soviet Union looming up here and so like it or not we're going to have to kind of

1467
02:19:36.24 --> 02:19:41.76
find a way to like bring Turkey back into the fall the mean Turkey was in NATO by the 1950s

1468
02:19:42.56 --> 02:19:48.08
and it was considered a strategic necessity to just kind of forget about all this you know you get

1469
02:19:48.08 --> 02:19:55.76
all the way up to the 1980s and there was a um an American scholar named Susan Blair who found a

1470
02:19:55.76 --> 02:20:01.76
bunch of the American consulate documents that people hadn't people didn't even know about these yet

1471
02:20:01.76 --> 02:20:05.68
you know because nobody was studying this it was not something that people really wanted to look into

1472
02:20:05.68 --> 02:20:10.000
because Turkey we we have nuclear weapons and turkeys is a it's a premium important ally in the

1473
02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:15.84
cold war nobody wants to look at this and so in the 1980s Susan Blair finds all these documents by

1474
02:20:15.84 --> 02:20:19.44
people like Leslie Davis describing everything that they've seen out there and she says well this

1475
02:20:19.44 --> 02:20:24.72
is incredible right set up as a book tries to get it published she can't get it published anywhere

1476
02:20:24.72 --> 02:20:30.40
she's told by major publishers that this is too controversial we we can't touch this and the thing is

1477
02:20:30.40 --> 02:20:36.40
those people were right because she finally found a publisher and that publisher started getting bomb

1478
02:20:36.40 --> 02:20:40.64
threats they started getting death threats she and her family had to go into hiding for a while

1479
02:20:41.20 --> 02:20:47.20
because uh the Turkish government they don't play around like um have you seen that movie the promise

1480
02:20:48.24 --> 02:20:53.04
no it's it's a great movie it's about the Armenian genocide and it's a really really good movie

1481
02:20:53.04 --> 02:20:56.48
but you wouldn't know that I maybe this has changed a little bit now you wouldn't know that by going

1482
02:20:56.48 --> 02:21:02.24
on like rotten tomatoes the first night or first day that that thing was released there were like

1483
02:21:02.24 --> 02:21:08.72
5,000 like one star terrible horrible worst movie ever reviews and like all of them had kind of

1484
02:21:08.72 --> 02:21:13.68
broken English and like whatever else I mean you see that and then immediately afterwards literally

1485
02:21:13.68 --> 02:21:18.08
like the next year there was another Armenian genocide movie that was put out it was sponsored by

1486
02:21:18.08 --> 02:21:25.92
the Turkish government and it was just it's almost worth watching for just the the the madness of

1487
02:21:25.92 --> 02:21:31.52
the propaganda I mean you really have to like imagine a movie about the Nazis and the Holocaust

1488
02:21:31.52 --> 02:21:36.48
where all of the SS officers and Heinrich Kim learned everybody else are just portrayed it's like

1489
02:21:36.48 --> 02:21:41.44
they're just really trying to help all these Jews but like the Jews they just they ran off out

1490
02:21:41.44 --> 02:21:45.60
there into Poland and something happened to them and I don't I mean it's that bad you know it's really

1491
02:21:45.60 --> 02:21:51.76
that bad and it is like a state effort ever since then um you know it was happening at the time

1492
02:21:51.76 --> 02:21:56.08
they were they a lot of this was carried out with burn after reading telegrams and things like that some

1493
02:21:56.08 --> 02:22:02.24
of them were preserved but um throughout the 20th century all the way up to the present day there's

1494
02:22:02.24 --> 02:22:06.80
Turks still going through all the archives and going through it and being out shred that shred that they've

1495
02:22:06.80 --> 02:22:12.08
been doing it for centuries and it's because they I mean look um this is this is maybe one of the

1496
02:22:12.08 --> 02:22:19.12
darker things to point out about it is they know they know the deck at work you know people forget

1497
02:22:19.12 --> 02:22:24.48
things people forget everything it doesn't matter what you did or how bad it was or how many people

1498
02:22:24.48 --> 02:22:31.04
were affected they have this idea that if you just keep denying it keep calling everybody a liar keep

1499
02:22:31.04 --> 02:22:37.28
just do whatever you got to do the give it a century all we have to do is survive you know if you

1500
02:22:37.28 --> 02:22:40.96
if you look like this was something that was really prominent at the time right you read all the

1501
02:22:40.96 --> 02:22:46.56
read the writings of Lenin for example and Trotsky and Stalin you know all the Bolsheviks and you

1502
02:22:46.56 --> 02:22:51.92
see the same strain in Hitler where they all understood that we're about to do something that is

1503
02:22:51.92 --> 02:22:59.60
horrific and barbaric and that is going to be condemned by everyone and we better not lose this war

1504
02:23:00.48 --> 02:23:05.92
but if we don't if we pull it off and all we have to do is survive and then wait it out

1505
02:23:06.64 --> 02:23:14.88
and the storm will pass and um it passed very quickly like I said Hitler was partly inspired by

1506
02:23:14.88 --> 02:23:22.56
you know the the Armenian example specifically because even by then just 30 years later 25 years later

1507
02:23:22.56 --> 02:23:28.64
at that point when I got started even by then he could say and make a good point with it who

1508
02:23:28.64 --> 02:23:37.76
today remembers the Armenians this is 25 years after his own country was allied to the Ottoman

1509
02:23:37.76 --> 02:23:47.84
Empire as it executed one of the most thorough and complete genocides in history well you can say

1510
02:23:47.84 --> 02:23:55.52
there was some level of vengeance on it and we're not going to talk about that now but we are going

1511
02:23:55.52 --> 02:24:03.36
to talk about operation nemesis on the unraveling podcast which we also do it's a little

1512
02:24:03.36 --> 02:24:08.16
take things a little bit different and a little bit deeper and we'll do that we'll talk about

1513
02:24:08.16 --> 02:24:14.72
operation nemesis well you can listen to it right now it's um jocco unraveling podcast where

1514
02:24:14.72 --> 02:24:20.80
Daryl and I are going to go deep well we're going to go deep on on this operation that carried out

1515
02:24:20.80 --> 02:24:26.64
it was a what did you call it a campaign of assassination that's exactly what it was and and it was

1516
02:24:26.64 --> 02:24:31.84
done by a bunch of Armenians without any state support you know if you think about

1517
02:24:31.84 --> 02:24:36.56
everybody looks looks like what the masad did the Israelis did after the second world war they

1518
02:24:36.56 --> 02:24:43.12
hunted down a thousand fifteen hundred Nazi officers SS officers around the world and that's you know

1519
02:24:44.16 --> 02:24:48.72
that's that's good for them but the Armenians you had a group people who were doing this completely

1520
02:24:48.72 --> 02:24:53.20
independently without any state support this group of hardcore militants who hunted these people down

1521
02:24:53.84 --> 02:24:58.96
all around the world and essentially took out the entire Ottoman government that was running this

1522
02:24:58.96 --> 02:25:03.28
during during the period all the high ranking people there is one other thing I want to close with I kind

1523
02:25:03.28 --> 02:25:09.36
of forgot about earlier because there is uh to on the whole question of turkish denialism um

1524
02:25:10.40 --> 02:25:16.40
this is a quote from a letter written by the leader of the special organization a guy named

1525
02:25:16.40 --> 02:25:22.000
behind the inch of care and this was a letter that was found fairly fairly recently last few decades

1526
02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:28.72
um this is right near the beginning of it he said the committee of union in progress as the

1527
02:25:28.72 --> 02:25:33.76
bearer of the nation's honor has decided to free the homeland from the inordinate ambitions of

1528
02:25:33.76 --> 02:25:38.32
this accursed nation and to assume the responsibility for the blemish that will stain

1529
02:25:38.32 --> 02:25:43.60
Ottoman history in this regard the committee which cannot forget the country's bitter and unhappiness

1530
02:25:43.60 --> 02:25:50.000
and whose cup runeth over with unrelenting desire for revenge has decided to annihilate all Armenians

1531
02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:55.76
living within Turkey not to allow a single one to remain and has given the government broad authority

1532
02:25:55.76 --> 02:26:00.96
in this regard on the question of how this killing and massacring will be carried out the central

1533
02:26:00.96 --> 02:26:05.52
government will give the necessary instructions to the provincial governors and army commanders

1534
02:26:05.52 --> 02:26:10.000
all of the unionist regional representatives would concern themselves with following up on the

1535
02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:15.68
matter in all of the places where they were found and would ensure that not a single Armenian would

1536
02:26:15.68 --> 02:26:25.92
receive protection or assistance not a lot of room for doubt there evil

1537
02:26:31.76 --> 02:26:38.40
with that echo Charles maybe we could do a little decompression old school decompression

1538
02:26:38.40 --> 02:26:45.28
scenario that was a rough one say a second yeah I don't I'm not sure that I can do that right

1539
02:26:45.28 --> 02:26:50.72
this moment but Jesus man it kind of hard to listen to all that and then even that last part

1540
02:26:50.72 --> 02:26:55.92
and then be like yeah by the way yeah it let's all start you know get back to lifting weights

1541
02:26:55.92 --> 02:27:03.04
and drinking well if you remember like I think the very first time I actually needed the decompression

1542
02:27:03.04 --> 02:27:09.44
I want to say it was podcast number 12 didn't take long but after podcast number 12

1543
02:27:09.44 --> 02:27:18.32
where we were we talking about the the highlander in prison and you know he's getting tortured by

1544
02:27:18.32 --> 02:27:26.40
the Japanese he's having the the maggots eat the gangrene flesh off of his legs in order to survive

1545
02:27:27.12 --> 02:27:33.36
he gets put to a medical camp eventually gets put out to see while he's you know

1546
02:27:33.36 --> 02:27:40.16
um you know the whole of a ship with however many hundreds of prisoners shooting all over themselves

1547
02:27:40.16 --> 02:27:44.80
and in their own urine and sweating and starving to death and dying and then they get hit by

1548
02:27:44.80 --> 02:27:50.08
because the because the Japanese didn't mark their prison ships so they get hit by a torpedo

1549
02:27:50.08 --> 02:27:55.28
and most of the guys die but he somehow gets thankfully recovered oh but but recovered by a

1550
02:27:55.28 --> 02:28:01.84
Japanese ship and so then from his Japanese ship he gets taken back to shore and he is stationed

1551
02:28:01.84 --> 02:28:09.28
in a prison camp in the outskirts of hero shima so that was the first time where when I got

1552
02:28:09.28 --> 02:28:17.12
done reading some of his you know some of that book you know I said echo you talk for a little while

1553
02:28:17.12 --> 02:28:24.56
why freaking decompress so world can be a horrible place and the best thing we can do is maybe

1554
02:28:24.56 --> 02:28:30.48
make our little part of the world a little bit better what do you got for suggestions wow

1555
02:28:30.48 --> 02:28:40.000
let's start with our self mentally and physically hopefully don't forget I give you a hard time

1556
02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:45.20
about your job being super easy yeah this is one time you got to earn you know earn challenge

1557
02:28:45.20 --> 02:28:50.40
just a little for sure challenges rough transitions yeah well either way want to keep

1558
02:28:50.40 --> 02:28:56.48
ourselves together mentally fit and speak at a witch dill cooper always impressive with how deep

1559
02:28:56.48 --> 02:29:02.96
you can just sort of just go thank you time well you know good guns I you have little ways to go

1560
02:29:02.96 --> 02:29:08.000
which is cool you know and I'm very supportive of and you know either way we are working out

1561
02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:13.84
we're reading not as much as del cool but tell me what I can do to maybe to maybe catch up okay well

1562
02:29:13.84 --> 02:29:18.72
you could have get some stuff over he's got skills on the transition right now very good support

1563
02:29:18.72 --> 02:29:23.28
on the trans actually a big tip either yes we're working out we're reading we're doing all this

1564
02:29:23.28 --> 02:29:29.44
good stuff for ourselves so we can provide good stuff for others can make our little world a better

1565
02:29:29.44 --> 02:29:32.88
place and it spreads and before you know it we got a better place we're all living in

1566
02:29:32.88 --> 02:29:37.20
I'm in full support so this so while working out we might need some supplementation

1567
02:29:37.68 --> 02:29:43.76
probably helps the time helps all right let's start with discipline go right mental and physical

1568
02:29:45.12 --> 02:29:53.12
support we'll say and we have essentially an energy drink you don't like it still

1569
02:29:53.12 --> 02:29:58.000
it's hard to say that bro because here's the deal when you say essentially an energy drink what

1570
02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:02.80
do we think in this stigma we're thinking stigma we're thinking we're not just a stigma it's a

1571
02:30:02.80 --> 02:30:08.24
reality yeah reality is we you say energy drink you're talking about high sugar content ridiculous

1572
02:30:08.24 --> 02:30:13.60
caffeine bunch of chemicals to preserve the whole scenario we're talking I want to talk an energy

1573
02:30:13.60 --> 02:30:19.12
we're talking poison yeah that is the association for sure so well we're talking about that

1574
02:30:19.12 --> 02:30:24.16
we're not talking about that in fact I don't think we're ever gonna be talking about well technically

1575
02:30:24.16 --> 02:30:30.48
we're talking about it but when I'm talking about discipline go the RTD ready to drink

1576
02:30:31.28 --> 02:30:38.48
can of quantum quote essentially an energy drink this is what I'm talking about no chemicals

1577
02:30:38.48 --> 02:30:45.84
no sugar no taste good and it's good for you you drink two of these you know how people

1578
02:30:45.84 --> 02:30:51.12
you know we have friends I don't want to name any names Tim Ford he used to be might still be

1579
02:30:51.12 --> 02:30:56.96
odd enough but they'll get addicted to like energy drinks we'll get addicted to him meanwhile

1580
02:30:56.96 --> 02:31:00.16
without addiction you're getting less healthy less you know like you don't need drink three

1581
02:31:00.16 --> 02:31:05.36
of them you're like man that probably is jamming my health up this is probably no it's straight up

1582
02:31:05.36 --> 02:31:10.24
is straight up yeah but this will need drink three of them guess what your health there so go get

1583
02:31:10.24 --> 02:31:14.88
addicted if you want get addicted to something good for you it's like getting addicted to carrots

1584
02:31:16.56 --> 02:31:21.12
you can't you can't you can't you can't I know that I know that I actually learned that one time

1585
02:31:21.12 --> 02:31:26.48
I had a whole like bag of carrots and then realized and and I you know whatever it was three hours

1586
02:31:26.48 --> 02:31:31.60
later as googling can you eat too many carrots and the google said yeah your body can't

1587
02:31:31.60 --> 02:31:38.48
digest too many carrots and so guess what your body does is not pretty don't eat too many carrots

1588
02:31:38.48 --> 02:31:44.40
but you can drink a lot of this one go yeah and not to go too deep into the too much of a good

1589
02:31:44.40 --> 02:31:51.12
thing concept but even technically the most vital nutrient if you want to call it water you can drink

1590
02:31:51.12 --> 02:31:57.28
too much water yeah it's called drowning diet no I think that's when you inhale the best thing about

1591
02:31:57.28 --> 02:32:04.40
to go energy drinks yeah I was one of those douche bags I was pounded like 300 milligrams of

1592
02:32:04.40 --> 02:32:07.76
caffeine I came in here one time with one of those things in chocolate like what are you drinking

1593
02:32:09.12 --> 02:32:14.96
what are you doing here so so I switched over a while back and here's where I was like I always thought

1594
02:32:14.96 --> 02:32:19.44
that I needed a huge amount of caffeine I drink one of those 300 milligrams things and after like

1595
02:32:19.44 --> 02:32:25.60
an hour I was just dead again I was like I guess I need 600 milligrams wrong I guess I need cocaus

1596
02:32:25.60 --> 02:32:29.84
the opposite of the truth because I actually switched over to these things which are like 95 I think

1597
02:32:29.84 --> 02:32:34.48
I only need one of them and I hit one of those things and it's good maybe I'll drink another one

1598
02:32:34.48 --> 02:32:37.68
if I got something to do in the evening but that's it there's a bunch of things that countered that

1599
02:32:37.68 --> 02:32:41.36
caffeine you know when you've got sugar in there it's like okay cool you're gonna get an insulin

1600
02:32:41.36 --> 02:32:45.36
head you're gonna bring you back down plus we've got thermal broning bromine in here things that

1601
02:32:45.36 --> 02:32:54.80
that help that caffeine in go helps it kick so you don't need to OD on it you last no need

1602
02:32:54.80 --> 02:33:02.08
um hey we also got joint warfare for your joints we got criloil for your overall general goodness

1603
02:33:02.96 --> 02:33:07.28
overall just general goodness in the world gets get yourself some criloil we got discipline

1604
02:33:07.28 --> 02:33:14.000
going a powder form yeah by the way the the jacco pomer the iced tea combination I think on both

1605
02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:19.68
I think on everything it's the best but that's what I like that's cool but I was mixing that up and

1606
02:33:19.68 --> 02:33:27.52
that's a freaking good tastey little treat you pre-judged it to scenario milk protein protein like

1607
02:33:27.52 --> 02:33:32.16
that chocolate peanut butter are you down with this exact your go to are we doing the decoder

1608
02:33:32.16 --> 02:33:38.72
mire technique making pudding or whatever the thing yeah yeah yeah I mean what was the rest I think

1609
02:33:38.72 --> 02:33:45.28
it's just like less milk or whatever but I think he put it in something like peanut butter something

1610
02:33:45.28 --> 02:33:49.76
no yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1612
02:33:55.68 --> 02:34:02.48
a tasty thing the peanut butter milk is a peanut butter is freaking delicious that thing is delicious

1613
02:34:02.48 --> 02:34:07.76
oh yeah I wouldn't drink it just like as a normal treat normal dessert yeah that's the

maybe you did well of course not because you took care of yourself you got to look out for

1642
02:36:58.24 --> 02:37:03.04
number one you took care of yourself so of course you're happy you're over here you've got

1643
02:37:03.04 --> 02:37:09.04
you got a cool shirt that I don't have I incidentally halfway took care of myself

1644
02:37:09.60 --> 02:37:14.56
and it just kind of came to light check in your attention so okay so we got this thing okay on

1645
02:37:14.56 --> 02:37:22.40
jockel store you click on the shirt locker SHURT creative you made it okay

1646
02:37:22.40 --> 02:37:28.16
okay creative yeah so sure actually I didn't make up somebody on twitter oh yeah Instagram

1647
02:37:28.16 --> 02:37:34.56
the Graham someone told me call it the shirt locker I was like yeah you fully approved

1648
02:37:34.56 --> 02:37:42.40
anyway so it's a subscription situation for shirts creative designs you had a question mark

1649
02:37:42.40 --> 02:37:46.80
I feel like there was a question mark in your head about like oh what a creative designs

1650
02:37:46.80 --> 02:37:52.88
yeah well I don't know what that means but they look cool and now you just were wearing the

1651
02:37:52.88 --> 02:37:59.20
other day on the mats of justice and I don't have it and then you explain that I can no longer get it

1652
02:38:00.16 --> 02:38:04.40
that's so anyways if you want to get cool shirts you don't want to miss out yeah so and and that

1653
02:38:04.40 --> 02:38:08.40
actually when you kind of explained a little bit of like yeah that is kind of a thing it's

1654
02:38:08.40 --> 02:38:13.84
it's because it's hard to communicate like hey the shirts are gonna be like cool maybe not what

1655
02:38:13.84 --> 02:38:18.08
you're used to all the time but they will be cool to have whatever maybe that's an indication

1656
02:38:18.08 --> 02:38:23.28
that people don't really trust your assessment of what's cool it's not be that isn't may the

1657
02:38:23.28 --> 02:38:28.72
facts are these it's hard to be like hey guys get this they're gonna be cool and then that's

1658
02:38:28.72 --> 02:38:32.88
sort of it maybe it's just your personality that you like me I think we have this similarity

1659
02:38:32.88 --> 02:38:36.88
we don't like sitting here saying like hey I'm making something and it's gonna be cool

1660
02:38:36.88 --> 02:38:40.88
that yeah so that would be whack that makes sense yeah so I'm gonna say echo's been making

1661
02:38:40.88 --> 02:38:46.24
some stuff and it's cool and if you want to get it then you gotta go get that shirt locker on

1662
02:38:46.24 --> 02:38:51.60
including myself because apparently yes if a cool shirt gets made that actually says discipline

1663
02:38:51.60 --> 02:38:58.16
if you're gonna want it I don't get a version I don't get a pair what is it a copy a copy

1664
02:38:58.80 --> 02:39:03.52
issue an issue I'm getting a huge nothing okay so this this was the thing from the beginning

1665
02:39:03.52 --> 02:39:08.24
if you remember shirt locker you get you get a shirt that month and it's gone you don't we don't

1666
02:39:08.24 --> 02:39:12.08
sell them on the on the store it's gone that's why you sign up for the shirt locker so you can get them

1667
02:39:12.64 --> 02:39:17.68
every month yeah so you can't come to me after everyone's already arrived and be like where's mine

1668
02:39:17.68 --> 02:39:22.000
it's like well again I think we we have to take some always can't blame everyone we have to take

1669
02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:29.44
and ownership and be like hey the ownership is we have failed to convey the level of

1670
02:39:29.44 --> 02:39:35.36
coolness of the shirts that are coming so if you want to if you want some get your shirt locker on

1671
02:39:35.36 --> 02:39:41.36
yeah that's about that yeah so just go store dot com also don't forget about the just the

1672
02:39:41.36 --> 02:39:48.16
year everyday representing on the path it's not an easy path but if you're representing it is

1673
02:39:48.16 --> 02:39:52.72
your heart path yes or something you know and if you're representing let's face it it makes that path

1681
02:40:34.64 --> 02:40:42.32
strange things happening in the podcast world in the whole world censorship random people being

1682
02:40:42.32 --> 02:40:47.44
pulled off of platforms we don't know what's gonna happen and we would be stupid not to have

1683
02:40:47.44 --> 02:40:52.72
some kind of a contingency plans we have a contingency plan of if we need to we don't want to but if we

1684
02:40:52.72 --> 02:41:01.68
need to we can survive some kind of a traumatic platform of end where if they want to start putting

1685
02:41:03.04 --> 02:41:08.48
advert to injecting advertisements into this podcast or whatever we don't want to have that happen so

1686
02:41:08.48 --> 02:41:13.28
we need to have an alternative platform we're building it we don't want to take sponsors and have people

1687
02:41:13.28 --> 02:41:20.24
you know have to do reads I don't want to do that so if you want to help us not do that and you

1688
02:41:20.24 --> 02:41:26.16
want to help us have a contingency ready then you can you can subscribe to jockel underground at

that we're not doing that all right there you go I've been lying in bed for three hours I can't sleep

it's an opportunity to talk about things that are just outside the purview of actual jockel podcast

1696
02:42:08.40 --> 02:42:14.16
speaking of which I got some good topics coming up on that one I got some good things we're going to go

1701
02:42:39.84 --> 02:42:47.60
the assistant director I assume it's I assume it's a slow cooker as usual psychological warfare

1702
02:42:47.60 --> 02:42:54.000
I made an album telling echo how to overcome his moments of weakness and he recorded it and now

1703

1710
02:43:35.20 --> 02:43:44.56
we'll get it up there final spin I wrote a book that is a fiction book I can't novel to me just doesn't

1711
02:43:44.56 --> 02:43:52.56
sound cool does it sound cool do you know even especially if I was like I wrote it no that sounds weird right

1712
02:43:52.56 --> 02:43:57.12
yeah it doesn't match it doesn't match does it doesn't match does it so I need to come up with another

1713
02:43:57.12 --> 02:44:02.96
word maybe I'll come up with another word like mulk but for like something that's kickass that's not true

1714
02:44:02.96 --> 02:44:09.44
that's a story mulk and then I can be like oh I wrote a whatever that thing is okay and that way I

1715
02:44:09.44 --> 02:44:15.52
can still you know feel feel good about it yeah that's a good idea because I don't this is not my thing

1716
02:44:15.52 --> 02:44:20.64
like I wrote a novel yeah I mean like technically what's the technical definition of a novel

1717
02:44:20.64 --> 02:44:27.68
there DC oh if you start wanting to differentiate it between a novella and a novel it gets very

1718
02:44:27.68 --> 02:44:32.40
hairy sometimes maybe let's say a hundred pages I think it's pretty I think it's pretty well you're

1719
02:44:32.40 --> 02:44:36.72
talking about the difference between extreme ownership yeah no I am talking about I'm talking about what's a

1720
02:44:36.72 --> 02:44:41.68
novel yes it's like category have you ever what's a cool novel that you've read or you've read

1721
02:44:41.68 --> 02:44:47.12
blood and reading okay that's the only cool not well I'm maybe there's some other ones but yeah blood

1722
02:44:47.12 --> 02:44:52.56
but you call blood-mrading a novel yeah okay then I guess I'm down with a kind of

1723
02:44:52.56 --> 02:44:56.08
because blood-mrading it's better yeah but then the next step is to call yourself a novel is

1724
02:44:56.08 --> 02:45:04.80
you ready for that because I wrote a novel writing line with freaking blood-mrading

1725
02:45:04.80 --> 02:45:10.56
I'm a novelist who wrote a novel the the story is called final spin it's available for pre-order
