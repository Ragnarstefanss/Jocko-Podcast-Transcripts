i'm going i'm not going to say a damn word about how how you should maneuver this platoon because he was right i had i had a brigade lead and the other story is command sergeant major uh... crisp capillary was my command sergeant major when i commanded twenty-eighth infantry division uh he used to say uh as he would go out and talk to the leaders and coach and mentor leaders he would he would say leaders could stop things from getting screwed up just by the fact that they were there just by their mere presence uh so you know that's why it's so important again you know for for leaders to get out there because people are going to do the right thing and adhere to those standards when they know to leader is is there uh i was uh down in florida uh a while back doing some leadership training for a sheriff's department down there and one of the the deputy sheriff's was speaking to a group of corporals and he told the story how in the in the in the jail there uh how uh some deputies that should have been in the kitchen watching the prisoners do what they were doing uh you know cooking the meal uh just neglected to be there as they should and things really got out of hand and his point was just because the sergeant wasn't going down and checking to make sure those deputies were doing the right thing they you know the human beings are just decided hey you know this must be that important because nobody's checking on us so we're not going to be doing the right thing and so his point was again just by the mere fact of a leader being present they're going to fix things just by being there this is a reminds me of of another chapter in the book here chapter 11 an organization's personality say in 1985 i took command of an infantry company in the 28th infantry division Pennsylvania National Guard the infantry company i commanded was designated alpha company second battalion hundred and ninth infantry and the unit had an authorized strength of 144 soldiers i was honored to have an opportunity to lead the commission officers non-commission officers and soldiers assigned to the outfit i remembered reading an army leadership manual earlier in the in my career before taking this command in the manual there was a statement i will never forget it's at a military unit and any organization for that matter takes on the personality of its leader when reading that statement as a young inexperienced leader i doubted it and again you know all in line would hit the ground running you know a lot of people say don't volunteer for anything right you know I think that's a big mistake tell me you you you you got a volunteer to take on those tough things and and when you do that you know a couple of benefits first of all nobody's gonna expect you to succeed if you're just starting it you're you know out in your career you know you're not gonna have high expectations if you're just starting out and so by tackling those tough things gaining that experience you know it's just like you know in the military you know a second lieutenant army to lowest ranking commissioned officer you're expecting a second lieutenant to make a mistake you know I think it was like the second year lumbarty was the head coach he was just chewing Bart Star out relentlessly during this practice and you know talk about moral courage after practice Bart Star goes to Coach lumbarty's office and he goes hey coach can I talk to privately for a few minutes coach says yeah sure what's up and Star says to him he goes coach he goes I don't want you ever chewing me out in front of the team again said I'm the quarterback I'm leading this team he goes if they see you chewing me out the way you were chewing me out he goes I'm not going to be able to lead this team effectively in the lumbarty light bulb an often said any realized he could not treat everybody exactly the same way you know so he never chewed Bart Star out in front of the team again because he realized that what Star said was exactly correct you know he couldn't lead the team effectively if he was going to be treated like that and so again just just some great lessons we could learn from from from past leaders and you know I just tried I think we all tried to do our best when we hear these lessons to try to apply them if we could you know that's when you when you get a guy like Vincent Barty in the reputation that he has and he's humble enough to think oh if he if he can be humble in that situation and maybe less than one of his subordinates and say oh he's right oh he goes you know people are going to be watching to see are you react the first time somebody makes an honest mistake by demonstrating initiative and that was a little you know some good counsel from him so again leaders again to to develop and cultivate this trust and organization they put something out there now they really have to pay attention to make sure that they you know they they walk that the talk there and and and and do what they said they're going to do because people are going to be watching nobody's going to be leaving nobody's going to believe that written word until they actually see an action fast forward here you've talking about some of the internal attributes says if leaders cannot get in touch with their own feelings they will have difficulty understanding the feelings of others leaders must practice self awareness and mindfulness once one develops self-worth and you talk about I'm I'm fast forward a little bit you talk about journaling is a good technique like writing down what your thoughts what your feelings are so that you get some perspective on them I'm going to fast forward a little bit um once one develop self awareness one can then become better at controlling emotions followers look to leaders to be able to get things get stable when things get chaotic controlling ones emotions has many personal organizational and societal benefits I remember when I was young I was a young inexperienced leader I acted out in front of a group of my followers showing great displeasure not with them or maybe it was even some senior leader who was coaching me but said you know there's three things a commander could do to positively impact the battle once it begins he said the commanders use of fires you know close air support and direct fire the use of the reserves you know because usually the commander retains the authority of when to use his reserve and the third thing is personal presence on the battlefield and he said those are the three things a commander could do to influence the battle once it begins and and that always stuck to me stuck with me especially that notion of the personal presence on the battlefield and just having that personal presence there which help I think you know soldiers in battle or in a civilian sector you know employees in an organization realize that hey this leaders out with us sharing the load sharing the danger you know sharing what's coming our way and and you know they kind of get bolstered by that whole notion well I can attest to that I remember seeing you out on the battlefield the body looking over and say well there's the brigade commander I Roger that I guess he's I guess he's not sitting back in the talk all the time he's out here with the troops like you said seeing what's happening understanding what's happening and taking that risk I mean if you were in Ramadi and you were out in the city you were at risk and IEDs and and roadside bombs and RPGs and and machine guns don't they don't care what your name is they don't care what your rank is when I when I talk about vulnerability uh and we are to talk a little bit about the first part it's about uh having the courage to leave your comfort zone allowing yourself to be vulnerable to try something maybe you haven't tried before something that's a little bit hard but the other um aspects of vulnerability is putting yourself out there and exposing yourself to your followers and I'll tell you what I mean by that one way to expose yourself to your followers and I I think this is a helpful technique is sharing stories with your followers about times maybe when you tried something and you failed you know or or you made a mistake and uh the reason I think that's important is because you know followers look at at a leader the thing man they're in this position of leadership everything they touch in life must you know must have turned a goal they probably never made any mistakes so they want to be in this position of leadership and we know nothing could be farther from the truth so by by explaining to your followers how hey you know I've I've tried and I've failed sometimes and I've made mistakes and this is how is it able to overcome these mistakes that that inspires uh those followers and then the the other piece about vulnerability is having the humility to ask people on your team fast forward a little bit identify your core values to develop strong character you must take the time to figure out what you stand for and what your core values really are this came to light for me many years ago I attended a dinner at which the speaker gave an impassion talk about his own personal core values the next day as I was still thinking about what I heard I realized if someone asked me what my personal core values were I would not be able to give an answer sure I had values I tried to be an ethical person but to that point I never took the time to think long and hard about exactly what I stood for and my principles I never took the time to consider what values were most important to me important you know the other thing about values if if you don't understand what your own personal core values are when you make personal decisions or when it comes a time for you to make a personal decision about something I really believe you have to factor your your personal core values into decisions you make so if you don't have those core values articulated in your own mind how are you going to factor them in your decision and the same with organizations you know organizations many organizations have organizational values but when the leadership team gets together with the CEO and they're in the you know they're going through this decision making process how many of them actually factor the organizational values into the decision that they're making which I I would think I would just guess many don't even think about their values when they're making a business decision which is crazy to think about you know the the more you get down there you know I call it muddy muddy boots leadership they're more to get down there talk to the troops you know whether it be militarious civilian then you're able to develop that trust too because you're right the first time you go down and ask somebody hey how's it going they're not going to be totally honest with you if they don't know you but the more they get used to seeing you come around and and just having a rapport and see that you're hey normal guy and you really do want the best for the organization they're going to loosen up until later truth also don't burn your sources you know don't don't go back and say hey echo I need to talk to you John Gronsky said you were a tyrant and all that's not you're never going to get any information again and and then you know when you get it out there you know you've got to you've got to share it in a an multitude of ways you know when you're speaking to people one-on-one you've got a communicate that vision you're speaking to a group of 500 you've got to communicate the vision through email through your website through whatever you know social media means you might want to use but the vision then has to be consistent you know can't be a new flavor of the month or a new vision of the quarter you know like you said visions could change but but people have to know that you're expecting tomorrow to be a better day than today and who doesn't want to be around a leader who believes that tomorrow is going to be better than today you know because you know we want to move forward and and that that's what I mean by by positive energy and like we talked about earlier in the podcast here you have to have an action plan a believable action plan you know if you want to be known as as a as a positive leader because people aren't going to to follow you if they just think you're glad handing everything and you really don't have a plan to back it up that's important you know I did try to get out there a lot not because I had any type of you know courage to speak of but just because I felt it was necessary to do and the other thing for any military leader listening to this and and really it applies to business leaders too I would encourage my staff to get out there and and the reason I encourage my staff to get out there is because I felt it was important for my staff to also gain ground truth if if if the staff was gaining with they thought was to truth from reading reports they were missing about 80% of what was happening so although I know you know in the military a lot of times especially in operations like that the staff needs to be back doing staff work I always encourage them that hey they they did have to make time to actually get out there talk to troops see areas with their own eyes and again just a history from lesson hurt and force 28th infantry division fighting in the hurt and forest in in November 1944 the battle of Schmidt was a devastating time for the 28th infantry division in about four days over 6,000 casualties and one thing that was written about that period is it's said that general code to who is a division commander at the time most reports I read said he never even went as far forward as one of his regimental command posts and the staff did not go forward either not and we can make a decision so that's important stuff fast forward a little bit you know let's get a chapter in here called keeping your feet on the ground which is about humility you say I worked for an arrogant leader before it was not any fun all of us who work for this man felt our opinions were not valued he was the kind of guy who said things like when I want your opinion I'll tell you what it is stereotypical military but not actual military we believe we were not respected and we felt more like objects rather than we were part of the team the results are initiative imagination and creativity were stifled as you could imagine the leader failed again this is a this is one of those false images of military leadership does it happen yes it does happen and here's something else let's say about this you want to know what it does happen more often in the military and one of the reason it happens more often in the military is because in the military you're only in command for two years generally speaking so most of the enlisted guys you work in for a jerk or an arrogant person it takes them three months or three to six months ago hey this guy really is arrogant then at six months are like the path is kind of a routine it essentially is and this is important as with a routine where if you have a routine there's way way way less opportunity to make to have like oh like a decision making conundrum right because the routine the decision you have already made before part of the routine while you're not angry hang on through emotional departure exactly the question because you haven't had a freaking fish save a few hours either way if you're angry even you already know because dinner's soon or you know when the dinner is seem saying if you have a routine or lunch or but we'll back with whatever you're about to eat whatever you're almost almost all right take you off the path here's the here's what Ronald does he he just waits he waits for the people with no routine or an or he'll slide into your routine but a lot of times for people like me in this case where the little the little crack in the routine he's right there he's like no I realized how hard that that was for him and and again I think that the you know the lesson for anybody out here listening is hey you know you could be you know you could be a jackass you know if you want to be and not be approachable and you know my way or the highway I'm the boss you know who are you to tell me what to do we're giving me advice and it's you know like you said you don't have to worry about the buying if they came up with that I go into every meeting with my subordinates when I was in a pool tune when I was a task in a commander right now in the business world I walk into a meeting with my people my goals to use their plan that's my goal I don't want to use whatever I'm coming up with I want to use theirs and if you have that goal at the beginning that's going to lead you to the best possible place and look like you said if their plan is dumb which which you know you get to people come up with some dumb plans occasionally but occasionally some people come up with some dumb ideas that's okay ask them some earnest questions and they're going to see that their plan is the reality of their plan which is dumb but it has everything to do with winning a championship you know and exactly what you said you know you might have a win here there if you're not character based but if you want to be a champion if you want to have long term success you got to be a character based leader at least that's where I believe um another sub headline here is know your job and do your job and this I might might know that I took on this one it is there is such a thing as a stupid question and when we explain the you people always say oh there's no such thing as a stupid question if you show up to a job so they didn't realize that the call trail through the hurt and forest which they were sending Sherman tank down Sherman tank is eight and a half feet wide the call trail was nine feet wide I mean it was not a good you know means you know MSR means supply route or or good route of any sort for those tanks to be going along and so to lessen there is because the commander didn't get out on the battlefield because the staff didn't get out there they were relying on maps they didn't get the full understanding of what that hurt and forest area was was like so again for any civilian leader any military leader absolutely important not only to get out there yourself but to get your your staff the ones that you depend on to advise you to get out there as well you know there's another piece of this when when you are the leader and you what you're supposed to be doing is you're supposed to be detached you're not supposed to go out there and get in the firefighter not supposed to go out there and and run the marketing meeting or meet with the client necessarily or get and start manufacturing stuff on the line you're supposed to go out and look do you do you maybe do a couple moves on the manufacturing line to make sure you understand what's happening and so he introduces him he can see that the kid's kind of floating around not making the best decisions and so he says hey warriors live by a code and I point out you know the Marine Corps values the the the Ranger code the I just point out the you know the ancient you know the Samurai code the Viking gods I'm not putting them all in the book and say hey you need to make your own code and the kid ends up writing his own code and the uncle approves it this warrior kid code and then eventually I wrote another book called the code the evaluation of protocols which literally has like a code saying hey as an adult you still need a code you still need to figure out what it is you're trying to do what he trying to do with your life and if again if you have this code in place what I did is I went around to representative sampling of soldiers who were part of that brigade I would talk to a PFC that had like a year in Norm you know I would talk to a major who had may or may be 16-17 years in the army and every and a few folks in between there I mean 3000 soldiers can't talk to all of them and say hey where do you want to see this brigade go and the question I would ask them I would say hey you know if you fell asleep for five years and woke up five years from now what would you want to see this brigade look like then you know and the funny thing is whether it was a soldier low rank one year experience or higher ranking officer with 17 years experience
