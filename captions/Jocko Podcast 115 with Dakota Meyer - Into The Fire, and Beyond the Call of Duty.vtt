00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.26
This is Jocopodcast number 115.

2
00:00:04.26 --> 00:00:07.40
With echo Charles and me, Jocco Willing.

3
00:00:07.40 --> 00:00:08.70
Good evening, echo.

4
00:00:08.70 --> 00:00:09.70
Good evening.

5
00:00:12.20 --> 00:00:17.70
War is different for everyone who experiences it.

6
00:00:19.20 --> 00:00:28.50
On one end of the spectrum, there are some people who deployed to a safe area and protected by

7
00:00:28.50 --> 00:00:35.10
concrete and steel and barbed wire and their job, which is definitely an important part of the

8
00:00:35.10 --> 00:00:42.90
machine, but it just doesn't require them to be put into direct combat.

9
00:00:42.90 --> 00:00:50.82
And then with a little lock because of that situation, they can easily complete a wartime

10
00:00:50.82 --> 00:00:58.26
deployment with little or no contact with the enemy whatsoever.

11
00:00:58.26 --> 00:01:04.94
But they did their part and we are thankful for that.

12
00:01:04.94 --> 00:01:13.22
On the other end of the spectrum, there are some people that end up in anything but

13
00:01:13.22 --> 00:01:14.86
a safe area.

14
00:01:14.86 --> 00:01:20.94
They end up in the belly of the beast.

15
00:01:20.94 --> 00:01:32.38
They are called on to do more than is required and much more than could be expected.

16
00:01:32.38 --> 00:01:38.94
And that situation also creates a spectrum.

17
00:01:38.94 --> 00:01:45.34
Some men find it to be too much.

18
00:01:45.34 --> 00:01:51.78
And instincts of self preservation take over and they go into survival mode and they

19
00:01:51.78 --> 00:02:03.34
cover and they hide and they give up and they wait for the inevitable.

20
00:02:03.34 --> 00:02:06.58
But others do what they can.

21
00:02:06.58 --> 00:02:09.50
They try to do their duty.

22
00:02:09.50 --> 00:02:13.78
They put one foot in front of the other and they reload their weapon and they try to keep

23
00:02:13.78 --> 00:02:16.62
firing.

24
00:02:16.62 --> 00:02:19.70
That's the middle of the spectrum.

25
00:02:19.70 --> 00:02:35.38
And then at the far end of the spectrum, there are those men that step up and go forward

26
00:02:35.38 --> 00:02:42.62
across the threshold, really across the threshold of life and they go into the fire and

27
00:02:42.62 --> 00:02:52.46
into the flame and toward the unknown and toward death, not to save themselves.

28
00:02:52.46 --> 00:03:05.10
But they disregard their own safety and their own life to save their friends, their brothers

29
00:03:05.10 --> 00:03:11.22
and their comrades in arms.

30
00:03:11.22 --> 00:03:20.26
And then beyond even that, almost off the spectrum.

31
00:03:20.26 --> 00:03:27.50
There are those men that take that step across the threshold of life and death over and over

32
00:03:27.50 --> 00:03:32.74
and over again, not because they were ordered to not for a metal, not because of some

33
00:03:32.74 --> 00:03:43.86
men you factored set of ideals but simply because that is who they are.

34
00:03:43.86 --> 00:03:50.42
And I'm honored to have one of those men here with me today.

35
00:03:50.42 --> 00:04:08.14
I'm honored to have one of those men who have been here for a long time and I'm honored

36
00:04:08.14 --> 00:04:14.78
to have one of those men who have been here for a long time and I'm honored to have

37
00:04:14.78 --> 00:04:21.50
have three men greater than half in the Making What Ã¡gua A20 has.

38
00:04:21.50 --> 00:04:27.54
So, you'll always come into the building.

39
00:04:27.54 --> 00:04:32.14
You've always been here before.

40
00:04:32.14 --> 00:04:33.30
Okay.

41
00:04:33.30 --> 00:04:41.30
I have six men but, what do I do, be the channelwipie family?

42
00:04:41.30 --> 00:04:43.34
You know, I didn't come from money,

43
00:04:43.34 --> 00:04:45.74
didn't come from anything nice, you know.

44
00:04:45.74 --> 00:04:48.98
I ended up living my father, I'm adopted on my father's side.

45
00:04:48.98 --> 00:04:50.86
And you grew up on a farm.

46
00:04:52.70 --> 00:04:57.70
You know, it's just a simple way of life.

47
00:04:58.70 --> 00:04:59.54
You know what I mean?

48
00:04:59.54 --> 00:05:00.70
And that's just how we grew up.

49
00:05:00.70 --> 00:05:02.98
You know, my dad, you know, he always instilled in me.

50
00:05:02.98 --> 00:05:05.06
And you know, I have to give, you know, so much credit

51
00:05:05.06 --> 00:05:06.42
to my father and my grandfather.

52
00:05:06.42 --> 00:05:10.22
I mean, you know, I mean, they just, they instilled so much

53
00:05:10.22 --> 00:05:13.82
in me of what's right, what mattered, you know.

54
00:05:13.82 --> 00:05:19.02
You know, we're talking a lot of your childhood

55
00:05:19.02 --> 00:05:23.70
was, and I wrote down these notes, farm work, football,

56
00:05:23.70 --> 00:05:24.82
and females.

57
00:05:24.82 --> 00:05:25.82
Yeah.

58
00:05:25.82 --> 00:05:30.62
I mean, that's, that I told you, I'm simple.

59
00:05:30.62 --> 00:05:31.10
Yeah.

60
00:05:31.10 --> 00:05:31.94
That's it.

61
00:05:31.94 --> 00:05:32.78
That's it.

62
00:05:32.78 --> 00:05:34.22
You know, there's not much else.

63
00:05:34.22 --> 00:05:36.18
And clung me, you can tuck you down.

64
00:05:36.18 --> 00:05:39.06
And, you know, you wrote, you wrote a book.

65
00:05:39.06 --> 00:05:40.58
He's called into the fire and that's why I'm getting

66
00:05:40.58 --> 00:05:42.10
some of my information from him.

67
00:05:42.10 --> 00:05:44.14
And I would say that in the early descriptions,

68
00:05:44.14 --> 00:05:46.50
the way you describe yourself, not exactly

69
00:05:46.50 --> 00:05:50.26
Mr. sensitive is what we were dealing with back then.

70
00:05:50.26 --> 00:05:52.98
Oh, no, not at all.

71
00:05:52.98 --> 00:05:54.66
You know, I was, no, I wasn't sensitive.

72
00:05:54.66 --> 00:05:58.74
I was, I was just a hard-headed kid, you know.

73
00:05:58.74 --> 00:05:59.74
Said my ways.

74
00:05:59.74 --> 00:06:02.50
I, you know, my dad just instilled it in me.

75
00:06:02.50 --> 00:06:03.30
My dad instilled it.

76
00:06:03.30 --> 00:06:05.70
I mean, you know, my dad is a man who doesn't, you know,

77
00:06:05.70 --> 00:06:07.10
he doesn't care the social status.

78
00:06:07.10 --> 00:06:11.06
He's not a, you know, and I watch it from him.

79
00:06:11.06 --> 00:06:13.42
He's just a hard, hard guy, you know what I mean?

80
00:06:13.42 --> 00:06:16.34
And so there's not living in a house of two men, right?

81
00:06:16.34 --> 00:06:17.98
You know, me, and it's just my dad.

82
00:06:17.98 --> 00:06:18.98
Yeah.

83
00:06:18.98 --> 00:06:21.34
There's not, you know, there's not very me feeling.

84
00:06:21.34 --> 00:06:24.34
There wasn't a real nourishment to your sense of sight.

85
00:06:24.34 --> 00:06:26.94
There was not much nourishment.

86
00:06:26.94 --> 00:06:28.86
Yeah, there's one part of there talking about your

87
00:06:28.86 --> 00:06:31.70
football game and you jack up your elbow real bad.

88
00:06:31.70 --> 00:06:34.82
And so the coach got you in the locker room or whatever.

89
00:06:34.82 --> 00:06:37.86
Yeah, yeah, so I was sitting in the locker room and I,

90
00:06:37.86 --> 00:06:40.18
I, I had carried the ball.

91
00:06:40.18 --> 00:06:42.54
Play 18, 19 times the first half and I go in there.

92
00:06:42.54 --> 00:06:45.14
My elbows are like just jacked, right?

93
00:06:45.14 --> 00:06:46.94
I mean, you know, just get, we just get pounded.

94
00:06:46.94 --> 00:06:49.98
And I remember sitting in there and the coach like,

95
00:06:49.98 --> 00:06:51.38
hey, don't come out next half, right?

96
00:06:51.38 --> 00:06:53.94
You know, you just look, you know, because it was a JV game

97
00:06:53.94 --> 00:06:56.10
and he's like, you know, don't come out next half.

98
00:06:56.10 --> 00:06:57.18
And I'm gonna tell you something.

99
00:06:57.18 --> 00:06:58.66
My dad's seeing that I didn't come off

100
00:06:58.66 --> 00:07:01.70
when we were warming up for second half.

101
00:07:01.70 --> 00:07:03.70
And I mean, he came in there and that was not,

102
00:07:03.70 --> 00:07:04.70
that was not acceptable.

103
00:07:04.70 --> 00:07:06.66
The one thing my dad taught me is you started

104
00:07:06.66 --> 00:07:08.22
you finish it.

105
00:07:08.22 --> 00:07:10.46
Check, check.

106
00:07:10.46 --> 00:07:12.90
Now, what happened to that football career?

107
00:07:12.90 --> 00:07:16.06
What you did get some legitimate injuries, right?

108
00:07:16.06 --> 00:07:16.66
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

109
00:07:16.66 --> 00:07:19.10
I got, you know, I banged my knee up real bad

110
00:07:19.10 --> 00:07:21.94
on my sophomore year between my sophomore and junior year.

111
00:07:21.94 --> 00:07:24.54
Never really recovered from it, you know.

112
00:07:24.54 --> 00:07:27.74
And so I mean, I could have went and played somewhere.

113
00:07:27.74 --> 00:07:28.90
Like, I'm not gonna stick on my next hearing

114
00:07:28.90 --> 00:07:30.46
tell you I'd had full scholarships or anything.

115
00:07:30.46 --> 00:07:32.66
But I could have walked on somewhere, you know,

116
00:07:32.66 --> 00:07:34.90
probably played outside linebacker or, you know,

117
00:07:34.90 --> 00:07:36.10
a strong safety.

118
00:07:36.10 --> 00:07:40.42
But, you know, I just, I was gonna go play football

119
00:07:40.42 --> 00:07:41.26
and I'd planned on that.

120
00:07:41.26 --> 00:07:42.26
I'd been through the clearing house.

121
00:07:42.26 --> 00:07:44.06
I mean, I'd done everything I needed to do to go

122
00:07:44.06 --> 00:07:46.66
and, you know, my senior year and I just ended up

123
00:07:46.66 --> 00:07:48.42
going to the Marine Corps route.

124
00:07:48.42 --> 00:07:50.42
Now, I've talked a few times down here

125
00:07:50.42 --> 00:07:55.42
about the effectiveness of the Marine Corps recruiting program,

126
00:07:55.42 --> 00:07:57.90
which they have like the best recruiting numbers,

127
00:07:57.90 --> 00:07:59.54
but they spend the least on recruiting

128
00:07:59.54 --> 00:08:02.90
of any of the military service branches.

129
00:08:02.90 --> 00:08:05.62
And it sounds like you got rolled right into that.

130
00:08:05.62 --> 00:08:07.30
I did, they got me, they got me,

131
00:08:07.30 --> 00:08:10.06
I mean, they tell you something, they got me, you know.

132
00:08:10.06 --> 00:08:13.18
But, but I think, look, I, you know,

133
00:08:13.18 --> 00:08:14.90
the products, the product with them, right?

134
00:08:14.90 --> 00:08:16.50
Like, you know, you know, you're either,

135
00:08:16.50 --> 00:08:18.70
you either gonna be a Marine or you're not gonna be a Marine, right?

136
00:08:18.70 --> 00:08:20.50
Like, you're, you either have it in here, you don't.

137
00:08:20.50 --> 00:08:23.42
Like, it's not, you know, they just,

138
00:08:23.42 --> 00:08:25.26
they just know how to talk to their own, right?

139
00:08:25.26 --> 00:08:28.18
And I think that's what they're so good at is,

140
00:08:28.18 --> 00:08:32.10
is that they know how, they know what would have fired them up.

141
00:08:32.10 --> 00:08:34.58
And so they say the same thing that would have fired them up.

142
00:08:34.58 --> 00:08:37.14
And if you buy it on it, then you're the type of person

143
00:08:37.14 --> 00:08:37.98
needs to be a Marine.

144
00:08:37.98 --> 00:08:39.58
If you don't, they don't want you anyways.

145
00:08:39.58 --> 00:08:40.42
You know what I mean?

146
00:08:40.42 --> 00:08:41.82
Yeah, that's a perfect way to put it.

147
00:08:41.82 --> 00:08:43.26
And this is 2006.

148
00:08:43.26 --> 00:08:44.26
2006.

149
00:08:44.26 --> 00:08:45.10
2006.

150
00:08:45.10 --> 00:08:47.46
Again, this is something I always have to remind myself,

151
00:08:47.46 --> 00:08:49.94
and I'll remind everyone else while I'm at it,

152
00:08:49.94 --> 00:08:54.94
is, you know, when I joined the Navy in 1990,

153
00:08:54.94 --> 00:08:56.38
there was no war going on, right?

154
00:08:56.38 --> 00:08:57.22
There was no war going on.

155
00:08:57.22 --> 00:08:59.50
It was just, you know, peacetime.

156
00:08:59.50 --> 00:09:03.14
And you're joining in 2006, where are two different countries?

157
00:09:03.14 --> 00:09:06.02
And 2006, things are not going well.

158
00:09:06.02 --> 00:09:07.74
They're a little quiet.

159
00:09:07.74 --> 00:09:09.06
And Afghanistan at that time.

160
00:09:09.06 --> 00:09:10.66
But Iraq is full more.

161
00:09:10.66 --> 00:09:12.30
I mean, that's when I was in the Marine.

162
00:09:12.30 --> 00:09:14.62
It was a real hard fighting, was taking place.

163
00:09:14.62 --> 00:09:17.98
And all our problems, the rest of Iraq, was pretty bad.

164
00:09:17.98 --> 00:09:21.14
So you know, for you, you know you're going,

165
00:09:21.14 --> 00:09:22.22
and you know you're going to go to combat.

166
00:09:22.22 --> 00:09:23.86
I mean, that's just like kind of a given.

167
00:09:23.86 --> 00:09:27.14
Yeah, I mean, I, I don't know that I ever really,

168
00:09:27.14 --> 00:09:29.42
understood that though until I was in.

169
00:09:29.42 --> 00:09:29.94
You know what I mean?

170
00:09:29.94 --> 00:09:32.74
I think that I don't think it ever really hit me.

171
00:09:32.74 --> 00:09:34.26
I never really, I didn't really join.

172
00:09:34.26 --> 00:09:35.82
I can't sit here and give you some moto story

173
00:09:35.82 --> 00:09:37.18
that I joined to go, you know,

174
00:09:37.18 --> 00:09:38.34
it's got a Venge 911, right?

175
00:09:38.34 --> 00:09:39.58
You want to hear something that's jacked up?

176
00:09:39.58 --> 00:09:40.42
Yeah.

177
00:09:40.42 --> 00:09:42.46
I joined in 1990, and I had the opposite view for it,

178
00:09:42.46 --> 00:09:44.18
which is, I mean, there's no war going on.

179
00:09:44.18 --> 00:09:46.14
I don't know how to say, should I go on the war?

180
00:09:46.14 --> 00:09:47.38
I was like, oh, it's all on.

181
00:09:47.38 --> 00:09:49.30
I can go, the seals got to be doing things all over.

182
00:09:49.30 --> 00:09:51.70
I don't know how you're doing stuff we don't even hear about.

183
00:09:51.70 --> 00:09:52.94
That's what my attitude is.

184
00:09:52.94 --> 00:09:53.94
And here you were staring at,

185
00:09:53.94 --> 00:09:56.98
there were two different zones, and you're like, I don't know

186
00:09:56.98 --> 00:09:57.82
for the way to happen.

187
00:09:57.82 --> 00:10:00.50
Oh, you know, because I mean, honestly,

188
00:10:00.50 --> 00:10:02.50
I know what sounds dumb, but I mean,

189
00:10:02.50 --> 00:10:06.30
by that time we're five years past it,

190
00:10:06.30 --> 00:10:08.06
and people had already got used to it, right?

191
00:10:08.06 --> 00:10:11.46
It was no longer like, oh shit, right?

192
00:10:11.46 --> 00:10:13.62
And the population, you know,

193
00:10:13.62 --> 00:10:15.50
in the average civilian, right?

194
00:10:15.50 --> 00:10:17.70
It wasn't, you know, because they've been doing it

195
00:10:17.70 --> 00:10:19.02
for what five years.

196
00:10:19.02 --> 00:10:22.02
And so, you know, I didn't really think about it.

197
00:10:22.02 --> 00:10:23.94
You know, I honestly, and you know, I joined,

198
00:10:23.94 --> 00:10:25.34
I wanted to go infantry.

199
00:10:25.34 --> 00:10:28.34
I wanted to fight, but I didn't really,

200
00:10:28.34 --> 00:10:29.34
I don't think it ever really hit me

201
00:10:29.34 --> 00:10:30.66
until I got into boot camp, you know,

202
00:10:30.66 --> 00:10:33.14
and then I really started understanding what,

203
00:10:33.14 --> 00:10:34.58
and when you were going boot through boot camp,

204
00:10:34.58 --> 00:10:37.30
at that time, basically every drone structure

205
00:10:37.30 --> 00:10:38.70
must have been coming back from the battlefield.

206
00:10:38.70 --> 00:10:39.54
All of them.

207
00:10:39.54 --> 00:10:42.26
I mean, I'm telling you, everybody, especially,

208
00:10:42.26 --> 00:10:45.78
especially in a school of infantry,

209
00:10:45.78 --> 00:10:48.50
they'd all, everyone had been,

210
00:10:48.50 --> 00:10:49.70
they were in the shoes.

211
00:10:49.70 --> 00:10:50.54
They were in the shoes.

212
00:10:50.54 --> 00:10:51.98
I mean, everyone I'm been in the shoes.

213
00:10:51.98 --> 00:10:52.82
Yeah.

214
00:10:52.82 --> 00:10:54.14
Even my recruiter, my recruiter,

215
00:10:54.14 --> 00:10:55.66
had just got back from Felicia.

216
00:10:55.66 --> 00:10:56.50
Dang.

217
00:10:56.50 --> 00:10:57.34
Yeah.

218
00:10:57.34 --> 00:10:58.18
And he'd been in the shoes.

219
00:10:58.18 --> 00:10:58.70
Yeah.

220
00:10:58.70 --> 00:10:59.70
Dang.

221
00:10:59.70 --> 00:11:00.54
Yeah.

222
00:11:00.54 --> 00:11:03.10
So, with that, I'm going to take it to the book right now,

223
00:11:03.10 --> 00:11:06.94
because, you know, I think I was never in the Marine Corps.

224
00:11:06.94 --> 00:11:09.70
I'm pretty sad about that sometimes.

225
00:11:09.70 --> 00:11:13.58
But I have like, read so much about the Marine Corps

226
00:11:13.58 --> 00:11:15.50
over my life and,

227
00:11:15.50 --> 00:11:17.78
hang around with so many Marines

228
00:11:17.78 --> 00:11:19.02
or work with the Marine so much.

229
00:11:19.02 --> 00:11:20.98
So whenever I get to Marine Corps boot camp,

230
00:11:20.98 --> 00:11:23.66
it's like strikes a romantic side of me.

231
00:11:23.66 --> 00:11:25.66
I just did this once,

232
00:11:25.66 --> 00:11:27.82
but at least get a little taste.

233
00:11:27.82 --> 00:11:30.74
And you did it really fast, which is great.

234
00:11:30.74 --> 00:11:32.54
But here it is, and it's just like,

235
00:11:32.54 --> 00:11:34.50
exactly what we're going to the book.

236
00:11:34.50 --> 00:11:37.50
Again, this book is into the fire by the go to fire.

237
00:11:37.50 --> 00:11:39.34
And here we go.

238
00:11:39.34 --> 00:11:40.90
So it began.

239
00:11:40.90 --> 00:11:44.34
Close haircuts to strip away your old identity.

240
00:11:44.34 --> 00:11:46.98
Exercise is to prove you're not half as strong

241
00:11:46.98 --> 00:11:49.46
as you figured simple tasks to show you that

242
00:11:49.46 --> 00:11:51.54
you're mentally weak, drill instructors

243
00:11:51.54 --> 00:11:53.54
who mock your attempts to look tough.

244
00:11:53.54 --> 00:11:56.86
It's right out of the movies, but it never stops.

245
00:11:56.86 --> 00:11:58.02
And there you go.

246
00:11:58.02 --> 00:11:59.26
You know what's coming.

247
00:11:59.26 --> 00:12:01.46
How many times did you watch Full Metal Jacket before you went in?

248
00:12:01.46 --> 00:12:02.30
A ton.

249
00:12:02.30 --> 00:12:03.62
Yeah. I mean, a ton.

250
00:12:03.62 --> 00:12:05.18
You know exactly what's happening.

251
00:12:05.18 --> 00:12:06.02
Yeah.

252
00:12:06.02 --> 00:12:07.38
Does that even help?

253
00:12:07.38 --> 00:12:08.22
No.

254
00:12:08.22 --> 00:12:09.06
It's just still.

255
00:12:09.06 --> 00:12:11.62
No, you could, I mean, you know,

256
00:12:11.62 --> 00:12:16.46
like during boot camp, it was the hardest thing I'd ever been through.

257
00:12:16.46 --> 00:12:18.34
So when I look at everything I did in the Marine Corps,

258
00:12:18.34 --> 00:12:19.14
it was the easiest.

259
00:12:19.14 --> 00:12:20.66
Yeah.

260
00:12:20.66 --> 00:12:22.18
That's the same thing with Buds.

261
00:12:22.18 --> 00:12:23.58
So first of all, when I went through Buds,

262
00:12:23.58 --> 00:12:25.06
and I didn't know anything about Buds,

263
00:12:25.06 --> 00:12:28.34
no one knew anything about Buds is 1990 when I joined the Navy.

264
00:12:28.34 --> 00:12:29.46
Didn't know anything about it.

265
00:12:29.46 --> 00:12:31.14
And so I always think that,

266
00:12:31.14 --> 00:12:32.14
like guys are coming in now,

267
00:12:32.14 --> 00:12:34.22
you can basically watch the entire Bud,

268
00:12:34.22 --> 00:12:35.14
you can watch the whole thing.

269
00:12:35.14 --> 00:12:35.98
You know what I think?

270
00:12:35.98 --> 00:12:39.30
They, the students eventually captured the schedules.

271
00:12:39.30 --> 00:12:40.14
Yeah.

272
00:12:40.14 --> 00:12:41.34
And so they'd actually know what's coming.

273
00:12:41.34 --> 00:12:43.46
And you know, you know how many people

274
00:12:43.46 --> 00:12:44.78
it keeps from quitting?

275
00:12:44.78 --> 00:12:45.62
None.

276
00:12:45.62 --> 00:12:46.46
I'm a nutritionist.

277
00:12:46.46 --> 00:12:47.30
Yeah.

278
00:12:47.30 --> 00:12:48.62
Okay, so it's gonna suck really bad.

279
00:12:48.62 --> 00:12:49.46
And now you know it.

280
00:12:49.46 --> 00:12:50.62
You didn't know it before.

281
00:12:50.62 --> 00:12:51.46
Yeah.

282
00:12:51.46 --> 00:12:52.62
You even know when it's gonna end.

283
00:12:52.62 --> 00:12:54.46
You know what I mean?

284
00:12:54.46 --> 00:12:55.78
Yeah.

285
00:12:55.78 --> 00:12:56.62
All right.

286
00:12:56.62 --> 00:12:57.46
Back to the book.

287
00:12:57.46 --> 00:12:59.58
The second month is the turnaround.

288
00:12:59.58 --> 00:13:00.98
When they build you back up,

289
00:13:00.98 --> 00:13:03.14
Sergeant Brady made me a squad leader,

290
00:13:03.14 --> 00:13:07.02
meaning he yelled at me for the mistakes of the other 10 recruits.

291
00:13:07.02 --> 00:13:07.86
That was all right.

292
00:13:07.86 --> 00:13:08.70
He had his job.

293
00:13:08.70 --> 00:13:10.42
I had mine.

294
00:13:10.42 --> 00:13:11.54
You bust it through,

295
00:13:11.54 --> 00:13:13.14
you get to graduation day,

296
00:13:13.14 --> 00:13:15.02
which was obviously awesome.

297
00:13:15.02 --> 00:13:16.98
And then it's,

298
00:13:16.98 --> 00:13:20.54
I spent the next two months at SOI School of Infantry,

299
00:13:20.54 --> 00:13:24.42
only 15% of the Marine Corps and the Army are in the infantry.

300
00:13:24.42 --> 00:13:25.42
And today's military,

301
00:13:25.42 --> 00:13:28.34
there are more combat pilots and infantry squad leaders.

302
00:13:28.34 --> 00:13:29.18
Dang.

303
00:13:30.02 --> 00:13:30.86
Yeah.

304
00:13:30.86 --> 00:13:32.82
Man, that's crazy.

305
00:13:32.82 --> 00:13:36.98
15% of the Marine Corps and the Army are infantry troops

306
00:13:36.98 --> 00:13:37.82
for the ground.

307
00:13:37.82 --> 00:13:40.14
That's a interesting figure.

308
00:13:40.14 --> 00:13:40.66
In Vietnam,

309
00:13:40.66 --> 00:13:42.38
and I was talking about this with Laf and

310
00:13:42.38 --> 00:13:44.98
actually the whole echelon front team the other day.

311
00:13:44.98 --> 00:13:46.10
I had heard this somewhere,

312
00:13:46.10 --> 00:13:48.30
I heard it from Hackworth that in Vietnam,

313
00:13:48.30 --> 00:13:49.98
the height of the Vietnam War.

314
00:13:49.98 --> 00:13:53.46
There was a little over 500,000 troops on the ground.

315
00:13:53.46 --> 00:13:55.06
And it was only 10% of those troops

316
00:13:55.06 --> 00:13:57.78
that were infantry units at well on the ground and combat.

317
00:13:57.78 --> 00:14:00.46
Yeah, you know what I find so interesting about that fact.

318
00:14:00.46 --> 00:14:01.66
And that stat when I looked at it,

319
00:14:01.66 --> 00:14:03.94
you know, like I didn't understand it obviously when I was in.

320
00:14:03.94 --> 00:14:04.54
But you know,

321
00:14:04.54 --> 00:14:07.42
what I look at it is to understand how much it truly,

322
00:14:07.42 --> 00:14:08.82
you know, as the war fighter,

323
00:14:08.82 --> 00:14:10.62
you know, I think we take for granted so many times

324
00:14:10.62 --> 00:14:13.62
of what it really takes for us to be able to do our job effectively.

325
00:14:13.62 --> 00:14:16.74
I mean, you take, you know, I mean, it takes, you know,

326
00:14:16.74 --> 00:14:20.74
85% of the organization just to support that 15%.

327
00:14:20.74 --> 00:14:23.06
To put you face to face with the enemy.

328
00:14:23.06 --> 00:14:23.90
Yes.

329
00:14:23.90 --> 00:14:26.26
There's got to be another, yeah.

330
00:14:26.26 --> 00:14:28.86
I mean, you look at a 10 to 15 to one or something like that.

331
00:14:28.86 --> 00:14:29.86
It's crazy.

332
00:14:29.86 --> 00:14:30.86
10 to one.

333
00:14:30.86 --> 00:14:32.10
That's got to put you up there.

334
00:14:32.10 --> 00:14:33.10
But that's where works.

335
00:14:33.10 --> 00:14:35.06
And that's well, here we go.

336
00:14:35.06 --> 00:14:37.82
Breaking down, breaking down a little bit of what the Marine Corps is like.

337
00:14:37.82 --> 00:14:40.22
A Marine Squad is comprised of three four man fire teams.

338
00:14:40.22 --> 00:14:43.10
Everything you do is a rifleman revolves around that four man team.

339
00:14:43.10 --> 00:14:47.30
One man carries a weapon more powerful than those of the others.

340
00:14:47.30 --> 00:14:48.66
But that's a minor point.

341
00:14:48.66 --> 00:14:51.90
In the field, you don't do anything without those three other guys.

342
00:14:51.90 --> 00:14:55.82
You don't shit, sleep, eat or move without the other three

343
00:14:55.82 --> 00:14:57.22
knowing about it.

344
00:14:57.22 --> 00:14:57.74
Yeah.

345
00:14:57.74 --> 00:15:01.22
A Marine Squad with those three fire teams is like a boxer

346
00:15:01.22 --> 00:15:04.62
with three arms, one arm jabs with bursts of fire

347
00:15:04.62 --> 00:15:07.30
to keep the opponent off balance while the other arm loops

348
00:15:07.30 --> 00:15:11.14
around the left hook with a third arm ready to follow up

349
00:15:11.14 --> 00:15:12.54
wherever there's an opening.

350
00:15:12.54 --> 00:15:14.82
Four armers wounded the other two can keep fighting.

351
00:15:14.82 --> 00:15:18.54
Fire to pin down the enemy maneuver to finish them off fire maneuver,

352
00:15:18.54 --> 00:15:20.26
fire maneuver, fire maneuver.

353
00:15:20.26 --> 00:15:23.22
And I always have to point this out.

354
00:15:23.22 --> 00:15:25.26
Extreme ownership book, you know, this is cover move.

355
00:15:25.26 --> 00:15:26.86
This is what I was talking about the fundamental.

356
00:15:26.86 --> 00:15:29.14
This is that's the fundamental gun fighting tactic.

357
00:15:29.14 --> 00:15:29.98
Yes.

358
00:15:29.98 --> 00:15:33.50
Fire maneuver, I was called a cover move.

359
00:15:33.50 --> 00:15:36.62
So you get done with SOI.

360
00:15:36.62 --> 00:15:42.26
And you head out to the third Marine Regiment

361
00:15:42.26 --> 00:15:43.26
in Hawaii.

362
00:15:43.26 --> 00:15:44.26
Yeah.

363
00:15:44.26 --> 00:15:46.26
So how was that when you checking it?

364
00:15:46.26 --> 00:15:47.26
Oh yeah.

365
00:15:47.26 --> 00:15:52.26
Well we pulled in and as soon as we pulled the bus in the seniors,

366
00:15:52.26 --> 00:15:53.26
you know, they're all there.

367
00:15:53.26 --> 00:15:58.26
I'll just got back from a pedithead to the triad and had a hard deployment.

368
00:15:58.26 --> 00:16:01.26
They got to shit kicked out of them.

369
00:16:01.26 --> 00:16:05.86
And so we pulled in and they, you know, there's no empathy there.

370
00:16:05.86 --> 00:16:09.86
And so we pulled in and there's throwing beer bottles off the deck and they are all hammered

371
00:16:09.86 --> 00:16:14.86
it's in the middle of the night and you know, so it's like welcome.

372
00:16:14.86 --> 00:16:16.06
You know, but it was awesome.

373
00:16:16.06 --> 00:16:18.50
You know, I was honored to be out there.

374
00:16:18.50 --> 00:16:22.38
And how long it takes for the sniper bill to open up and for you to get that?

375
00:16:22.38 --> 00:16:23.38
Yeah.

376
00:16:23.38 --> 00:16:26.50
So it was, I think it was like around February.

377
00:16:26.50 --> 00:16:29.18
So I got there in October.

378
00:16:29.18 --> 00:16:30.18
So it's a 10 rock.

379
00:16:30.18 --> 00:16:31.74
So I got there in October, November.

380
00:16:31.74 --> 00:16:32.74
So November timeframe.

381
00:16:32.74 --> 00:16:35.18
I think I got to Hawaii, October, November timeframe.

382
00:16:35.18 --> 00:16:38.06
And then it opened in, January, February timeframe.

383
00:16:38.06 --> 00:16:40.10
Is it hard to get a sniper bill?

384
00:16:40.10 --> 00:16:41.10
Did you get lucky?

385
00:16:41.10 --> 00:16:42.10
No, no, no, no, no guy get a sniper bill?

386
00:16:42.10 --> 00:16:43.10
Yeah, so I did.

387
00:16:43.10 --> 00:16:46.98
So I was actually the youngest sniper in the Marine Corps in 2007.

388
00:16:46.98 --> 00:16:49.46
So what happened was, is I had ran in Docs.

389
00:16:49.46 --> 00:16:51.94
So you have to run an in doc to be part of the puttone.

390
00:16:51.94 --> 00:16:54.18
So you come in and then like you're on probation.

391
00:16:54.18 --> 00:16:55.18
So you run a huge in doc.

392
00:16:55.18 --> 00:16:56.18
You come in.

393
00:16:56.18 --> 00:16:56.94
You go on probation.

394
00:16:56.94 --> 00:17:00.82
And then you start, you know, usually you were going to deployment and then after

395
00:17:00.82 --> 00:17:02.38
deployment, you go to school.

396
00:17:02.38 --> 00:17:03.34
Well, they had a couple of schools.

397
00:17:03.34 --> 00:17:05.54
So that's open up and school.

398
00:17:05.54 --> 00:17:08.74
And they basically gave me the option of you can either go home on pre-deployment

399
00:17:08.74 --> 00:17:10.78
leave because we're heading that rack.

400
00:17:10.78 --> 00:17:13.98
You can either go home pre-deployment leave or you can go to sniper school.

401
00:17:13.98 --> 00:17:14.98
How old were you?

402
00:17:14.98 --> 00:17:15.98
I was 18.

403
00:17:15.98 --> 00:17:18.30
How many milliseconds did it take you to make that decision?

404
00:17:18.30 --> 00:17:20.70
I said, I've been with my family for 18 years.

405
00:17:20.70 --> 00:17:22.70
I'm all good.

406
00:17:22.70 --> 00:17:23.70
Oh, man.

407
00:17:23.70 --> 00:17:24.70
That's awesome.

408
00:17:24.70 --> 00:17:28.10
And then Marine Corps sniper school.

409
00:17:28.10 --> 00:17:30.10
That's a hard course school.

410
00:17:30.10 --> 00:17:31.10
Yeah.

411
00:17:31.10 --> 00:17:32.46
And 50% of Trisha and Rape.

412
00:17:32.46 --> 00:17:33.46
Yeah.

413
00:17:33.46 --> 00:17:34.66
We had seals in it with us.

414
00:17:34.66 --> 00:17:35.66
Yeah.

415
00:17:35.66 --> 00:17:39.94
And then, you know, our early seal snipers, you know, and I don't know the full, I'll

416
00:17:39.94 --> 00:17:42.98
bring a sniper on here someday that knows the whole history of the seal sniper program.

417
00:17:42.98 --> 00:17:46.58
But it's deeply rooted in the Marine Corps sniper program, deeply rooted.

418
00:17:46.58 --> 00:17:49.42
Just like all of our training is rooted in Marine Corps scouts and raiders.

419
00:17:49.42 --> 00:17:52.02
There's a lot of crossover in those early days.

420
00:17:52.02 --> 00:17:56.70
But the Marine Corps sniper program, now everyone's going to think that's a civilian's

421
00:17:56.70 --> 00:17:58.90
going to think like, oh, you're sitting on a gun shooting.

422
00:17:58.90 --> 00:18:00.58
But that's not really the hardest part.

423
00:18:00.58 --> 00:18:02.50
That's like 5% of the job.

424
00:18:02.50 --> 00:18:04.50
Like it's like the, it's.

425
00:18:04.50 --> 00:18:06.22
I would say I would say it's less than that.

426
00:18:06.22 --> 00:18:10.62
You know, I mean, you got, I mean, the communication piece of the mission planning.

427
00:18:10.62 --> 00:18:17.70
I mean, there's so much, I mean, you literally, you literally are the, you know, the commanders,

428
00:18:17.70 --> 00:18:20.70
the tying commanders, trigger fair.

429
00:18:20.70 --> 00:18:21.70
Mm-hmm.

430
00:18:21.70 --> 00:18:23.46
You guys do have these stalking, right?

431
00:18:23.46 --> 00:18:24.46
Oh, yeah.

432
00:18:24.46 --> 00:18:25.46
That's just a gut check.

433
00:18:25.46 --> 00:18:27.02
And how much did you weigh at this point?

434
00:18:27.02 --> 00:18:29.06
Probably about 180, 185.

435
00:18:29.06 --> 00:18:32.82
And it's, um, where do you guys do your stalks?

436
00:18:32.82 --> 00:18:34.06
Uh, so we're in Hawaii.

437
00:18:34.06 --> 00:18:35.38
So I went to Hawaii sniper school.

438
00:18:35.38 --> 00:18:36.38
Okay.

439
00:18:36.38 --> 00:18:38.50
And we, we do them out in the Koukus out.

440
00:18:38.50 --> 00:18:39.86
And just dripping sweat.

441
00:18:39.86 --> 00:18:40.86
Oh.

442
00:18:40.86 --> 00:18:41.86
Lane in there.

443
00:18:41.86 --> 00:18:42.86
Lane in there.

444
00:18:42.86 --> 00:18:43.86
Lane in there.

445
00:18:43.86 --> 00:18:44.86
Lane in there.

446
00:18:44.86 --> 00:18:45.86
Lane in there.

447
00:18:45.86 --> 00:18:46.86
Lane.

448
00:18:46.86 --> 00:18:47.86
Crawling is terrible.

449
00:18:47.86 --> 00:18:47.86
Crawling for four hours and going 35 meters.

450
00:18:47.86 --> 00:18:50.82
Yeah, I mean, just like, you know, you know, you start off, you got 1,000 meter

451
00:18:50.82 --> 00:18:51.82
lane.

452
00:18:51.82 --> 00:18:54.30
You know, and they're, they put an observer up and they're using the best glass.

453
00:18:54.30 --> 00:18:56.58
There is, and they're sitting on this truck.

454
00:18:56.58 --> 00:19:03.30
And, uh, you have to, uh, you have to move up and, um, you got to get within, uh,

455
00:19:03.30 --> 00:19:07.46
you know, a certain distance and whatever they tell you and then you got, you know,

456
00:19:07.46 --> 00:19:11.02
you have to veg up and whatever you take shot, you can do whatever you, you know, just, you

457
00:19:11.02 --> 00:19:13.82
take a shot with a blank, okay.

458
00:19:13.82 --> 00:19:17.82
And then they come over and so, uh, they put a walker on you.

459
00:19:17.82 --> 00:19:21.06
A walker on you and then they try to walk, you know, back and forth.

460
00:19:21.06 --> 00:19:25.46
They try to find you and saying, see you or anything, then, you know, you lose.

461
00:19:25.46 --> 00:19:28.86
And then you got to take a second shot while, you know, because that walker gets within

462
00:19:28.86 --> 00:19:30.22
the vicinity of you.

463
00:19:30.22 --> 00:19:35.98
And like, like, 10 or 20 meters and then you take a second shot and if they see anything,

464
00:19:35.98 --> 00:19:38.26
you know, you, you fail to.

465
00:19:38.26 --> 00:19:41.82
So it's, you know, and what's a walker?

466
00:19:41.82 --> 00:19:46.38
So basically they bring a guy out who is like, who has like a stick or something and they

467
00:19:46.38 --> 00:19:50.18
can see him and then they try to say, so they go, okay, I think I see him here.

468
00:19:50.18 --> 00:19:53.46
So I need you to take left three steps and then back four steps.

469
00:19:53.46 --> 00:19:54.86
They try to walk him on you.

470
00:19:54.86 --> 00:19:55.86
That's true.

471
00:19:55.86 --> 00:19:56.86
That's true.

472
00:19:56.86 --> 00:20:00.94
When they get to you, do they say sniper at your feet to the guy?

473
00:20:00.94 --> 00:20:01.94
Huh?

474
00:20:01.94 --> 00:20:04.18
So yeah, yeah, yeah, you like to say it, sniper at your feet.

475
00:20:04.18 --> 00:20:07.18
That's the same thing that they say in the seal sniper school.

476
00:20:07.18 --> 00:20:08.18
That's what they say.

477
00:20:08.18 --> 00:20:10.34
They get there and they go, okay, sniper at your feet, you know, you're busted, you

478
00:20:10.34 --> 00:20:11.34
fail.

479
00:20:11.34 --> 00:20:13.18
Three steps left, two steps up, sniper at your feet.

480
00:20:13.18 --> 00:20:14.18
Yep.

481
00:20:14.18 --> 00:20:15.18
They'll say, nope.

482
00:20:15.18 --> 00:20:16.18
Yeah, I mean.

483
00:20:16.18 --> 00:20:19.62
So there's, there's the crossover that shows you that that stuff is rooted together.

484
00:20:19.62 --> 00:20:23.86
And there's a guy by the name of Skinta who is one of your instructors.

485
00:20:23.86 --> 00:20:25.42
You want your instructors, right?

486
00:20:25.42 --> 00:20:29.10
And here's a, here's a, going back to the book, Skinta told us about a sniper team in an

487
00:20:29.10 --> 00:20:33.46
Overwatch and a half constructed building in Ramadi in 2004.

488
00:20:33.46 --> 00:20:38.14
It was a warm, dull day and after several hours, they dosed off and never awakened.

489
00:20:38.14 --> 00:20:41.58
Insurgent, sneak up and shot all former reans in the head.

490
00:20:41.58 --> 00:20:48.06
They left behind a high powered M48A3 and it's excellent, Schmidt and Bender scope.

491
00:20:48.06 --> 00:20:51.06
Over the course of the next year, they allegedly killed two more Americans before Marines.

492
00:20:51.06 --> 00:20:56.26
And I protect them out and recover the rifle, Skinta hammered home his message, no every

493
00:20:56.26 --> 00:21:00.26
aspect of your job and never, never let down your guard.

494
00:21:00.26 --> 00:21:04.90
So if you slack off or you take things for granted, you die.

495
00:21:04.90 --> 00:21:09.38
He, um, I had a, look, I was fortunate to have a lot of people around me that influenced

496
00:21:09.38 --> 00:21:10.38
me.

497
00:21:10.38 --> 00:21:11.62
I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm nothing special.

498
00:21:11.62 --> 00:21:13.10
I'm the product of my environment.

499
00:21:13.10 --> 00:21:15.10
And my, I'm, I'm direct reflection of my leadership.

500
00:21:15.10 --> 00:21:16.10
I'm so fortunate.

501
00:21:16.10 --> 00:21:23.82
But I'll tell you right now that, um, what I did that day, um, was because him was, was because

502
00:21:23.82 --> 00:21:29.34
of the mentality that he instilled in me, of knowing your job, knowing it and obsessing with

503
00:21:29.34 --> 00:21:33.90
it and knowing every aspect of it and knowing everybody else's job around you.

504
00:21:33.90 --> 00:21:37.82
And then when you know your job and you know what's right, you, you do that.

505
00:21:37.82 --> 00:21:39.62
You don't worry about what everybody else says.

506
00:21:39.62 --> 00:21:44.74
Yeah, that the, the, the non-commissioned officers that again, they're saying guys that

507
00:21:44.74 --> 00:21:48.50
raised me in the sealed teams have such a huge impact.

508
00:21:48.50 --> 00:21:55.70
And what, what I also found interesting about this was this story about these snipers,

509
00:21:55.70 --> 00:21:59.42
when I got to her body in 2006, we heard this exact story.

510
00:21:59.42 --> 00:22:03.42
And you know, it was another thing that made us more paranoid and made my guys more paranoid

511
00:22:03.42 --> 00:22:04.42
being out there.

512
00:22:04.42 --> 00:22:06.74
And we actually had thought, I didn't, this has 2004.

513
00:22:06.74 --> 00:22:09.98
We thought it happened a little bit later and closer to our deployment.

514
00:22:09.98 --> 00:22:13.38
But, um, yeah, man, just, uh, just a nightmare.

515
00:22:13.38 --> 00:22:14.38
Yeah.

516
00:22:14.38 --> 00:22:20.06
Well, another little commentary from you here back to the book, shooting another human

517
00:22:20.06 --> 00:22:22.38
being was a math problem.

518
00:22:22.38 --> 00:22:27.90
You were either right or wrong with no subjective in between, decided by someone else.

519
00:22:27.90 --> 00:22:32.14
I liked problems that were black and white, life or death before taking a shot at a target

520
00:22:32.14 --> 00:22:33.38
1000 meters away.

521
00:22:33.38 --> 00:22:38.94
You had to calculate the effects of the light air and altitude, wind, humidity, angle of

522
00:22:38.94 --> 00:22:40.82
fire, cartridge velocity and gravity.

523
00:22:40.82 --> 00:22:44.42
You had to align the target, the background, the terrain, the weather, the noise and the

524
00:22:44.42 --> 00:22:45.42
weapon.

525
00:22:45.42 --> 00:22:47.58
You had to work in concert with others at the same time.

526
00:22:47.58 --> 00:22:50.90
The target enemy was figuring out how to kill you.

527
00:22:50.90 --> 00:22:56.06
Combat was a zero sum decision making played for the highest stakes.

528
00:22:56.06 --> 00:22:59.94
Liver die.

529
00:22:59.94 --> 00:23:04.94
And the 31 people started the course and 13 people graduated.

530
00:23:04.94 --> 00:23:10.78
So that, that should tell everyone why that sniper designation is so damn hard to get.

531
00:23:10.78 --> 00:23:11.78
It is.

532
00:23:11.78 --> 00:23:12.78
Because it's no joke.

533
00:23:12.78 --> 00:23:16.30
And there's usually at any point in time, there's not, there's usually around 300 school

534
00:23:16.30 --> 00:23:18.90
train snipers in the Marine Corps at any time.

535
00:23:18.90 --> 00:23:19.90
Really?

536
00:23:19.90 --> 00:23:20.90
Dang.

537
00:23:20.90 --> 00:23:21.90
Yeah.

538
00:23:21.90 --> 00:23:25.78
That's, in my task unit, which is about 40 seals, we had 13 snipers.

539
00:23:25.78 --> 00:23:26.78
Yeah.

540
00:23:26.78 --> 00:23:28.78
It was so awesome.

541
00:23:28.78 --> 00:23:29.78
Killers.

542
00:23:29.78 --> 00:23:30.78
Killers got lucky.

543
00:23:30.78 --> 00:23:31.78
You know, I got lucky.

544
00:23:31.78 --> 00:23:33.78
This is the stars aligned.

545
00:23:33.78 --> 00:23:34.78
Okay.

546
00:23:34.78 --> 00:23:38.94
So now you're trained up and then in 2007, you deploy to Iraq.

547
00:23:38.94 --> 00:23:39.94
I did.

548
00:23:39.94 --> 00:23:40.94
First deployment.

549
00:23:40.94 --> 00:23:41.94
How pumped were you?

550
00:23:41.94 --> 00:23:42.94
I was pumped.

551
00:23:42.94 --> 00:23:44.94
I just got out of school train sniper.

552
00:23:44.94 --> 00:23:46.94
Man, you know, I'm ready to go.

553
00:23:46.94 --> 00:23:49.94
I'm ready to go, turn the heat up, right?

554
00:23:49.94 --> 00:23:51.70
And where we were going was actually a bad spot.

555
00:23:51.70 --> 00:23:52.70
I mean, we were in karma.

556
00:23:52.70 --> 00:23:53.70
Nope.

557
00:23:53.70 --> 00:23:57.94
And it had been bad, but it was like, we were part of that surge.

558
00:23:57.94 --> 00:24:01.38
And when we got there, we took some contact once.

559
00:24:01.38 --> 00:24:04.94
And just like the water falls and turned off.

560
00:24:04.94 --> 00:24:07.42
You know, you go from streets that you're fighting down.

561
00:24:07.42 --> 00:24:10.62
And then you go to the next thing, you know, you can walk down the no gear.

562
00:24:10.62 --> 00:24:12.70
And so what were you guys doing just doing patrols?

563
00:24:12.70 --> 00:24:14.42
We were doing a lot of dwell ups.

564
00:24:14.42 --> 00:24:15.70
Which is what we could go out.

565
00:24:15.70 --> 00:24:19.70
Basically what they were the theory on this was we would go out off the five and stay like

566
00:24:19.70 --> 00:24:21.42
four or five days in a house.

567
00:24:21.42 --> 00:24:26.70
And you know, you know, we would get hit by indirect fire, you know, some.

568
00:24:26.70 --> 00:24:30.02
But I mean, but I was only there for like 45 days.

569
00:24:30.02 --> 00:24:32.90
And then you got, I got what hit in the hand, we're going to go with it.

570
00:24:32.90 --> 00:24:36.22
I got I got bid on the right hand by a spider.

571
00:24:36.22 --> 00:24:41.06
And actually suffered severe nerve damage loss to the movement my last three fingers.

572
00:24:41.06 --> 00:24:42.78
And they cast a vacuum for this.

573
00:24:42.78 --> 00:24:44.78
Yeah, or met a vacuum back to Germany.

574
00:24:44.78 --> 00:24:47.94
Yeah, so they sent me to Alessad and tried to fix it there.

575
00:24:47.94 --> 00:24:51.66
I did, they rushed me and I had two surgeries in Camp Fluja.

576
00:24:51.66 --> 00:24:54.86
And then they moved to Alessad and they sent me back to Germany.

577
00:24:54.86 --> 00:24:59.58
And I was there for like 25 days in the hospital and trying to save your hand basically.

578
00:24:59.58 --> 00:25:03.38
And then they sent me home and then I was having to do occupational therapy to get, you know,

579
00:25:03.38 --> 00:25:04.38
to get my fingers back.

580
00:25:04.38 --> 00:25:08.46
I wouldn't move, you know, when were you back in Kentucky?

581
00:25:08.46 --> 00:25:10.46
No, I was back at Hawaii.

582
00:25:10.46 --> 00:25:11.46
Okay, back in Hawaii.

583
00:25:11.46 --> 00:25:12.46
Yeah.

584
00:25:12.46 --> 00:25:13.46
All right.

585
00:25:13.46 --> 00:25:16.90
But you did have a little bit of Kentucky with you there in the form of bourbon.

586
00:25:16.90 --> 00:25:18.62
Yeah, yeah, a lot of it.

587
00:25:18.62 --> 00:25:19.62
I was drinking.

588
00:25:19.62 --> 00:25:20.62
I was a drinker.

589
00:25:20.62 --> 00:25:21.90
Started getting after it a little bit.

590
00:25:21.90 --> 00:25:22.90
I did.

591
00:25:22.90 --> 00:25:23.90
I didn't even a little bit too much.

592
00:25:23.90 --> 00:25:24.90
Yeah, too much.

593
00:25:24.90 --> 00:25:25.90
You know, it was hard.

594
00:25:25.90 --> 00:25:29.34
It was hard coming home and knowing my teammates were still over there and knowing that my unit

595
00:25:29.34 --> 00:25:30.34
was still there.

596
00:25:30.34 --> 00:25:32.38
And I wasn't part of it, you know.

597
00:25:32.38 --> 00:25:38.50
And then did you go, did you have to go back or you came back to states like on leave?

598
00:25:38.50 --> 00:25:39.98
No, no.

599
00:25:39.98 --> 00:25:41.54
After you were after your hand was hurt.

600
00:25:41.54 --> 00:25:42.54
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

601
00:25:42.54 --> 00:25:43.54
So I came back to Kentucky.

602
00:25:43.54 --> 00:25:44.54
Got it.

603
00:25:44.54 --> 00:25:45.94
And you hung out there for a while.

604
00:25:45.94 --> 00:25:47.74
And actually you lost a couple friends at that time.

605
00:25:47.74 --> 00:25:48.74
Yeah, I did.

606
00:25:48.74 --> 00:25:49.74
I did.

607
00:25:49.74 --> 00:25:51.74
Just tragic, tragic situations.

608
00:25:51.74 --> 00:25:52.74
Yeah, it was terrible.

609
00:25:52.74 --> 00:25:56.38
You know, I had to get the guy, you know, actually, you know, as names on my chest.

610
00:25:56.38 --> 00:25:58.70
And he would play football together.

611
00:25:58.70 --> 00:26:02.86
And he had called me, I was leaving the hospital.

612
00:26:02.86 --> 00:26:04.82
And I was coming home that weekend.

613
00:26:04.82 --> 00:26:06.94
And he had called me.

614
00:26:06.94 --> 00:26:09.50
He had called me right before I was on the way to the hospital and said, hey, man, we're

615
00:26:09.50 --> 00:26:10.50
going to go to this football game.

616
00:26:10.50 --> 00:26:13.58
You know, we're going to watch my little brother play, you know, all that.

617
00:26:13.58 --> 00:26:15.54
And I got to call as soon as I was leaving the hospital.

618
00:26:15.54 --> 00:26:17.54
And he had, he had a wreck and got killed.

619
00:26:17.54 --> 00:26:18.54
Yeah, close friend.

620
00:26:18.54 --> 00:26:20.54
I lost another friend.

621
00:26:20.54 --> 00:26:24.02
She got killed in December.

622
00:26:24.02 --> 00:26:25.02
Take.

623
00:26:25.02 --> 00:26:26.02
Yeah.

624
00:26:26.02 --> 00:26:28.42
Not exactly what you want to go home on leave for man.

625
00:26:28.42 --> 00:26:29.42
That's harsh.

626
00:26:29.42 --> 00:26:34.66
No, no, no, but you know, it's just the way it goes.

627
00:26:34.66 --> 00:26:36.58
And then, so you spend that time on home.

628
00:26:36.58 --> 00:26:37.86
You go back, you rejoin your retirement.

629
00:26:37.86 --> 00:26:41.14
And this is when you find out that they want volunteers to go help out in Afghanistan.

630
00:26:41.14 --> 00:26:42.86
Yeah, so we had built up.

631
00:26:42.86 --> 00:26:45.86
I was back probably a year and a half, went to Mount Sniper School.

632
00:26:45.86 --> 00:26:48.86
And, you know, I became a charge mountain.

633
00:26:48.86 --> 00:26:51.30
I got married, totally promoted.

634
00:26:51.30 --> 00:26:55.74
I was, you know, I was a Lance Corporal leading a five-man team with a sergeant on it.

635
00:26:55.74 --> 00:26:56.74
You know.

636
00:26:56.74 --> 00:27:01.50
You know, I ended up taking like I had the worst, like I got like the newest guys.

637
00:27:01.50 --> 00:27:03.34
They gave me the newest guys.

638
00:27:03.34 --> 00:27:06.98
And we ended up being the general support team.

639
00:27:06.98 --> 00:27:11.54
So we moved all the way up to the platoon and ended up being one of the best teams of

640
00:27:11.54 --> 00:27:12.70
the turn.

641
00:27:12.70 --> 00:27:15.10
And yeah, so we're out at 29 Palm.

642
00:27:15.10 --> 00:27:17.10
Is doing our final training up to go back to Iraq.

643
00:27:17.10 --> 00:27:18.82
And this was when nothing was going on in 2009.

644
00:27:18.82 --> 00:27:21.54
I mean, they weren't letting you leave the wire, right?

645
00:27:21.54 --> 00:27:22.54
And we had no mission.

646
00:27:22.54 --> 00:27:23.98
So it kind of sucked, right?

647
00:27:23.98 --> 00:27:27.70
And they came and said, when you five volunteers go to Afghanistan.

648
00:27:27.70 --> 00:27:29.26
And I said, what's the mission?

649
00:27:29.26 --> 00:27:31.74
I said, we don't know, but we just need five bodies.

650
00:27:31.74 --> 00:27:34.78
I raised my hand, said, yeah, I'm ready to go.

651
00:27:34.78 --> 00:27:36.78
Again, like I would be milliseconds.

652
00:27:36.78 --> 00:27:37.78
Yeah, no, no.

653
00:27:37.78 --> 00:27:38.78
This is zero.

654
00:27:38.78 --> 00:27:39.78
That decision.

655
00:27:39.78 --> 00:27:43.22
And so what you were volunteering for you find out later is it is embedded training

656
00:27:43.22 --> 00:27:44.22
team advisory teams?

657
00:27:44.22 --> 00:27:45.62
Explain what that's all about.

658
00:27:45.62 --> 00:27:50.18
So an embedded training team is where they take different ranks in different skill sets,

659
00:27:50.18 --> 00:27:53.42
Marines, and they put them, or you know, whatever, you know, military unit.

660
00:27:53.42 --> 00:27:59.18
They put them together, and they embed them with, you know, an Afghan unit.

661
00:27:59.18 --> 00:28:06.38
So we were embedded with 80 Afghan's, a whole, not a, it was a company.

662
00:28:06.38 --> 00:28:08.78
And so that's, we just lived, we did everything with them.

663
00:28:08.78 --> 00:28:15.74
We did everything from, you know, teach them weapons tactics and, you know, shoot and

664
00:28:15.74 --> 00:28:18.90
shoot and I did the change over for the NATO weapons, right?

665
00:28:18.90 --> 00:28:22.90
So we took them from the Soviets and the NATO weapons, and that's another key factor

666
00:28:22.90 --> 00:28:26.86
that we need to bring up to talk about and that gunfight.

667
00:28:26.86 --> 00:28:29.58
So we were, you know, teaching them on that, quall and them all, and that, you know, everything

668
00:28:29.58 --> 00:28:30.58
from everything.

669
00:28:30.58 --> 00:28:33.02
And we did everything with these guys.

670
00:28:33.02 --> 00:28:36.62
Because then, did you do any kind of work up before you went over?

671
00:28:36.62 --> 00:28:41.10
Yeah, so with that team, you're actual team that you're going to deploy with?

672
00:28:41.10 --> 00:28:42.74
Yeah, so we did, we did a work up with them.

673
00:28:42.74 --> 00:28:44.78
Actually, I just left point, I'm palms.

674
00:28:44.78 --> 00:28:50.42
I go back and we trained for like a month or two in Okinawa, Japan, with this new team.

675
00:28:50.42 --> 00:28:52.46
And then we head back to Tween Up Bombs.

676
00:28:52.46 --> 00:28:57.22
And then we went back, so we went to Bridgeport and then we came down Tween Up Bombs.

677
00:28:57.22 --> 00:29:01.38
We did all our mountain stuff at Bridgeport, all our mules and all that stuff, you know,

678
00:29:01.38 --> 00:29:07.42
packing and then we came down and did it, ended in Tween Up Bombs and then we headed over.

679
00:29:07.42 --> 00:29:09.86
And that was with that four-man team.

680
00:29:09.86 --> 00:29:15.90
Yeah, with Lieutenant Johnson, Gunny Kinnafick, and Doc Layton, myself.

681
00:29:15.90 --> 00:29:20.26
I'm going to talk about those guys a little bit here in the book.

682
00:29:20.26 --> 00:29:25.30
Lieutenant Mike Johnson's former team at Monti, this is where you end up, place called Monti,

683
00:29:25.30 --> 00:29:31.66
which is 10 miles north of another fob called Joyce, Lieutenant Johnson, Sonny, and Smiling

684
00:29:31.66 --> 00:29:37.22
with an easy laugh, but completely professional with the highest standards.

685
00:29:37.22 --> 00:29:39.46
I'd climbed mountains with him in California.

686
00:29:39.46 --> 00:29:43.78
Of course, and I knew he was a strong physically as he was mentally.

687
00:29:43.78 --> 00:29:49.42
Staff Sergeant Aaron Canifick was a personnel specialist with eight years expertise in

688
00:29:49.42 --> 00:29:54.30
administration, so his job was to bring some order to the Afghan personnel procedures and

689
00:29:54.30 --> 00:29:56.50
prey records.

690
00:29:56.50 --> 00:30:00.70
Doc Layton, our corpsman, would provide some basic medical care to the Afghans and the

691
00:30:00.70 --> 00:30:06.26
villages, but his primary job was to be ready in case any advisors or Afghan soldiers were wounded.

692
00:30:06.26 --> 00:30:07.54
I had a job too.

693
00:30:07.54 --> 00:30:11.86
Lieutenant Johnson put me in charge of tactics, operations, and weapons training.

694
00:30:11.86 --> 00:30:16.22
Before each patrol, I approved of the Afghan scheme of maneuver, inspected the radios

695
00:30:16.22 --> 00:30:20.54
and guns, coordinated fire support, and planned an emergency escape route.

696
00:30:20.54 --> 00:30:25.38
This was far easier than planning the sniper missions I'd been trained for.

697
00:30:25.38 --> 00:30:32.18
So you were kind of the most tactically savvy guy in the group being a sniper already

698
00:30:32.18 --> 00:30:33.18
to point to Iraq.

699
00:30:33.18 --> 00:30:39.02
Yeah, no, I was, and what prepared me was my training that I'd deal with my team, my

700
00:30:39.02 --> 00:30:42.18
sniper team, and look, I had, you know, people thought I was crazy.

701
00:30:42.18 --> 00:30:45.50
They thought I was crazy the way that I was training in my platoon before you were going

702
00:30:45.50 --> 00:30:46.50
to Iraq.

703
00:30:46.50 --> 00:30:47.50
We're not going to do anything.

704
00:30:47.50 --> 00:30:48.50
I'm like, I don't give shit.

705
00:30:48.50 --> 00:30:52.06
I was still learning tax at, and I was still learning, you know, sat calm, and I was

706
00:30:52.06 --> 00:30:53.06
still learning HF.

707
00:30:53.06 --> 00:30:54.78
And I was still learning how to learn a crypto.

708
00:30:54.78 --> 00:30:57.38
I mean, I wanted to know every aspect of every part of the job.

709
00:30:57.38 --> 00:31:02.26
I was learning every, I was going over to the BAS and learning, you know, all the medical

710
00:31:02.26 --> 00:31:05.90
stuff that I could, and I was, you know, I mean, everything I could do, like if I could

711
00:31:05.90 --> 00:31:11.26
get just a little nugget in knowledge and better myself and every aspect, I was doing it.

712
00:31:11.26 --> 00:31:12.26
So yeah.

713
00:31:12.26 --> 00:31:16.26
I was going to go over to this team.

714
00:31:16.26 --> 00:31:23.78
I mean, you know, I, I was the only tactical guy in there, you know, and yeah, and it was,

715
00:31:23.78 --> 00:31:27.06
you know, they, they, when it came to the tactics, when it came to making sure that the

716
00:31:27.06 --> 00:31:30.82
weapons were ready, when it came to making sure that the vehicles were ready, that, that,

717
00:31:30.82 --> 00:31:34.46
that the, you know, that the, the, the, the jammers were working, that, you know, what,

718
00:31:34.46 --> 00:31:37.62
if anything that mattered in the patrol, it was on me.

719
00:31:37.62 --> 00:31:38.62
It's on you.

720
00:31:38.62 --> 00:31:39.62
Yeah.

721
00:31:39.62 --> 00:31:40.62
The trucks were loaded.

722
00:31:40.62 --> 00:31:45.98
The reason that the Marine Corps put the teams together like this is because, well, that

723
00:31:45.98 --> 00:31:50.90
they're trying to develop the whole Afghan army, every aspect of it, not just the tactical

724
00:31:50.90 --> 00:31:54.54
side, but they want like the administration so that the people can start getting paid on

725
00:31:54.54 --> 00:31:55.54
time and the organization.

726
00:31:55.54 --> 00:31:56.94
So they got the lieutenant in there.

727
00:31:56.94 --> 00:31:58.86
And at the same time, they want to help the villagers.

728
00:31:58.86 --> 00:32:01.14
So they put a corpsman in there, so do medical work.

729
00:32:01.14 --> 00:32:04.26
So that's kind of just an animal, if anyone's thinking, why the hell would you put together

730
00:32:04.26 --> 00:32:05.26
a team like that?

731
00:32:05.26 --> 00:32:07.66
It's because the people that are supposed to do the fighting are actually supposed to be

732
00:32:07.66 --> 00:32:09.06
the Afghans, right?

733
00:32:09.06 --> 00:32:13.14
And, and, and the team is there to support them, help them train them and get them ready.

734
00:32:13.14 --> 00:32:14.14
Yeah.

735
00:32:14.14 --> 00:32:15.74
And that's that's the, that's the theory.

736
00:32:15.74 --> 00:32:16.74
Right.

737
00:32:16.74 --> 00:32:17.74
The theory is that you train them.

738
00:32:17.74 --> 00:32:18.74
You know, you train them.

739
00:32:18.74 --> 00:32:23.30
You know, you train them and they do the fighting and you're just there to advise them.

740
00:32:23.30 --> 00:32:24.30
Right.

741
00:32:24.30 --> 00:32:25.78
But it never works that way.

742
00:32:25.78 --> 00:32:26.78
It does.

743
00:32:26.78 --> 00:32:30.58
It didn't work that way in Iraq and, and one of the things that I pointed out many times was,

744
00:32:30.58 --> 00:32:34.14
you know, what kind of, you, you're, you want to develop a relationship with, with a group,

745
00:32:34.14 --> 00:32:35.14
right?

746
00:32:35.14 --> 00:32:38.14
And, and now you say, okay, we're in a train, you, but when it comes time to do something

747
00:32:38.14 --> 00:32:39.78
dangerous, you guys just go by yourselves.

748
00:32:39.78 --> 00:32:41.50
That's not, you know, I've been in a relationship.

749
00:32:41.50 --> 00:32:43.18
You're, you're, in fact, you're going backwards.

750
00:32:43.18 --> 00:32:45.14
No, it's, yeah, it's the same way.

751
00:32:45.14 --> 00:32:50.78
So you get there and you start doing, you're just kind of going on patrols.

752
00:32:50.78 --> 00:32:54.78
You're going on patrols with the, with the Afghan army company.

753
00:32:54.78 --> 00:32:57.62
It was kind of interesting, you know, because I was kind of the high-strung one on the team,

754
00:32:57.62 --> 00:33:01.50
you know, like I was like the one that always was, you know, we need to be ready to fight.

755
00:33:01.50 --> 00:33:06.18
You know, I don't know how many arguments I got into with some of the, the leadership and teams.

756
00:33:06.18 --> 00:33:10.10
You know, because we, we were 21-man team, but we were broken to four-man elements and spread out,

757
00:33:10.10 --> 00:33:11.42
you know, in this area.

758
00:33:11.42 --> 00:33:14.66
And I don't know how many times I got into arguments with people in the team of, you know,

759
00:33:14.66 --> 00:33:15.90
hey, this is how we need to do it.

760
00:33:15.90 --> 00:33:16.90
We need to stay up.

761
00:33:16.90 --> 00:33:17.90
I mean, I was, I was trying to train them.

762
00:33:17.90 --> 00:33:21.90
I was doing stuff of, you know, trying to train them to do IVs at night with, like, nods.

763
00:33:21.90 --> 00:33:23.22
And they're like, why the hell are we doing this?

764
00:33:23.22 --> 00:33:24.22
You know what I mean?

765
00:33:24.22 --> 00:33:26.70
Like, and a lot of people, you know, look down on it.

766
00:33:26.70 --> 00:33:29.94
And, and, and I said, I'm going to prepare to fight.

767
00:33:29.94 --> 00:33:33.50
And they said, you know, we're not, you know, they, so many times the leadership got on me.

768
00:33:33.50 --> 00:33:36.46
We're not going over there to fight. We're going to advise.

769
00:33:36.46 --> 00:33:42.30
And that was the mindset of a lot of this, and I'm not going to say my team, but a lot of the team.

770
00:33:42.30 --> 00:33:44.90
And, uh, and it showed.

771
00:33:44.90 --> 00:33:45.90
Yeah.

772
00:33:45.90 --> 00:33:50.78
Yeah, you know, for everyone out there, that's where in uniform right now, man.

773
00:33:50.78 --> 00:33:53.18
Be ready for the worst case scenario all the time.

774
00:33:53.18 --> 00:33:54.18
Be ready for it.

775
00:33:54.18 --> 00:33:55.46
You know what I tell him is.

776
00:33:55.46 --> 00:34:01.18
I said, you know, Lieutenant Johnson was a, was a, a calm guy, satellite guy.

777
00:34:01.18 --> 00:34:06.18
Locke, and was a blue-side quorum and gunny canific was an S1 guy.

778
00:34:06.18 --> 00:34:11.78
You know, and I always wonder, do you think that they ever thought they'd be in one of the deadliest

779
00:34:11.78 --> 00:34:12.78
battles in Afghanistan?

780
00:34:12.78 --> 00:34:15.58
Do you think they ever thought they didn't?

781
00:34:15.58 --> 00:34:18.98
You know, you don't know where you're going to be at, but one day you're going to be tested.

782
00:34:18.98 --> 00:34:19.98
Yeah.

783
00:34:19.98 --> 00:34:22.98
You better be ready.

784
00:34:22.98 --> 00:34:24.70
So you guys are rolling out on these patrols.

785
00:34:24.70 --> 00:34:29.30
Here's a good kind of aspect of what you see on those patrols.

786
00:34:29.30 --> 00:34:32.50
When you call the army, the Afghan army soldiers, ask ours.

787
00:34:32.50 --> 00:34:33.50
Am I saying that?

788
00:34:33.50 --> 00:34:34.50
I call it ask ours.

789
00:34:34.50 --> 00:34:35.50
Ask ours.

790
00:34:35.50 --> 00:34:36.50
All right.

791
00:34:36.50 --> 00:34:37.50
Here we go back to the book.

792
00:34:37.50 --> 00:34:39.90
When we walked into some hamlets, you could feel something was wrong.

793
00:34:39.90 --> 00:34:45.30
When kids through rocks at you, you knew what the parents were telling them.

794
00:34:45.30 --> 00:34:50.14
Sometimes the ask ours grabbed the kids soccer balls and sliced them apart.

795
00:34:50.14 --> 00:34:54.18
This didn't win any hearts and minds, but it did stop the rocks.

796
00:34:54.18 --> 00:34:59.54
Whenever the elders hurried through the ceremonial tea, though, I'd watch the ask ours.

797
00:34:59.54 --> 00:35:04.50
When any soldier senses danger, he crouches down a few inches to make himself less of

798
00:35:04.50 --> 00:35:05.90
a target.

799
00:35:05.90 --> 00:35:09.86
When the ask ours did that, I went on full alert.

800
00:35:09.86 --> 00:35:11.58
Houghes, I'm saying that right.

801
00:35:11.58 --> 00:35:15.10
So his name's Faazel, so I had named him Houghes in that to protect him.

802
00:35:15.10 --> 00:35:16.50
He's how he's here in America now.

803
00:35:16.50 --> 00:35:17.94
Okay, we're good.

804
00:35:17.94 --> 00:35:22.26
Houghes was our lead interpreter and we quickly learned our best warning system.

805
00:35:22.26 --> 00:35:29.34
At 37-year-old Sergeant Major retired from the Afghan Army, Houghes had served in Koonar for

806
00:35:29.34 --> 00:35:31.14
three years with advisor teams.

807
00:35:31.14 --> 00:35:35.82
The Afghan soldiers distrusted him because he refused to support their never-ending schemes

808
00:35:35.82 --> 00:35:37.82
to skim off the Americans.

809
00:35:37.82 --> 00:35:44.46
So he's your most trusted advisor, interesting that you point out how when soldier sense

810
00:35:44.46 --> 00:35:45.46
danger.

811
00:35:45.46 --> 00:35:50.22
I was telling you about J.P. my lead sniper and one of my two Patoons and two bruiser.

812
00:35:50.22 --> 00:35:55.98
When he came on the podcast, I described him walking through the streets and I told you

813
00:35:55.98 --> 00:36:01.14
man, I didn't think J.P. was going to live because J.P. was too brave for his own damn good.

814
00:36:01.14 --> 00:36:06.62
But when I'd be watching, I'd be like holding security and watching Patrogo and you'd

815
00:36:06.62 --> 00:36:09.58
see, you know, I'd see you guys moving with that little crouch because everyone's expecting

816
00:36:09.58 --> 00:36:11.14
that the shooting's going to start.

817
00:36:11.14 --> 00:36:15.86
And I'd see J.P. man walking with his head up and his chest out like ready to get something.

818
00:36:15.86 --> 00:36:21.54
Man, his nice feet 23 years old, the knock that you can die.

819
00:36:21.54 --> 00:36:23.10
So that's my brother, J.P.

820
00:36:23.10 --> 00:36:24.10
That's awesome.

821
00:36:24.10 --> 00:36:28.78
And the other thing that, you know, when you're in these foreign countries when you're

822
00:36:28.78 --> 00:36:33.14
in Iraq, you're in Afghanistan, the locals, we can't tell the difference between it.

823
00:36:33.14 --> 00:36:34.90
We really can't tell the difference between a good-body bag.

824
00:36:34.90 --> 00:36:38.74
I now you learned some sense of it when you go, okay, that guy looks shady.

825
00:36:38.74 --> 00:36:43.18
And you're probably pretty accurate, but a guy like half-hez, you're going to know.

826
00:36:43.18 --> 00:36:44.18
No, you can't.

827
00:36:44.18 --> 00:36:45.86
Definitely.

828
00:36:45.86 --> 00:36:49.42
He was the unofficial fifth member of our team inside of Hamlet.

829
00:36:49.42 --> 00:36:54.98
If he shook his head at us, we knew it was time to forget the tea and get out.

830
00:36:54.98 --> 00:36:59.90
So how much good, how much, how often would you go into Hamlet and the people cool and

831
00:36:59.90 --> 00:37:01.30
all good and drink and tea?

832
00:37:01.30 --> 00:37:06.38
And, you know, most time, I mean, most time, look, I mean, look, I, you know, the people

833
00:37:06.38 --> 00:37:07.38
there want it to be better.

834
00:37:07.38 --> 00:37:09.38
I mean, they live in the shit.

835
00:37:09.38 --> 00:37:11.02
They live, they want it to be better.

836
00:37:11.02 --> 00:37:12.62
You know, they're just caught in a bad situation.

837
00:37:12.62 --> 00:37:14.14
It's not, it's not a, it's not a, it's not a, it's not a, it's not a, it's not a, it's

838
00:37:14.14 --> 00:37:15.82
a simple equation.

839
00:37:15.82 --> 00:37:21.86
You know, there's nothing simple about the life that they have to live.

840
00:37:21.86 --> 00:37:25.26
You made some friends going back to the book and the hills along the Pakistani border, no

841
00:37:25.26 --> 00:37:28.22
Afghan military or civilian had much of anything.

842
00:37:28.22 --> 00:37:31.66
I think practically every American soldier, Marine, tried to help in some way.

843
00:37:31.66 --> 00:37:35.30
We purchased candy and trinkets and the markets to give to the kids.

844
00:37:35.30 --> 00:37:38.98
I soon had two little buddies boys about 10 or 11.

845
00:37:38.98 --> 00:37:41.18
They'd hang around the main gate.

846
00:37:41.18 --> 00:37:47.50
My dad made that trying to say, when they saw me at first I'd buy him coax and then started

847
00:37:47.50 --> 00:37:51.82
sharing my care packages from home, soap, candy, peanuts, gun, gum.

848
00:37:51.82 --> 00:37:53.10
Maybe a decade from now.

849
00:37:53.10 --> 00:37:56.90
Some kids remember that some Americans were kind of them, even when their older brothers

850
00:37:56.90 --> 00:37:58.46
were shooting at them.

851
00:37:58.46 --> 00:37:59.46
Maybe not.

852
00:37:59.46 --> 00:38:03.94
You don't help out because you expect something in return.

853
00:38:03.94 --> 00:38:08.38
So you're, you're a human being man trying to take care of some kids out there.

854
00:38:08.38 --> 00:38:20.78
I think this is getting into your first sort of legit, we'll call it combat.

855
00:38:20.78 --> 00:38:22.34
And you're taking some small arms fire.

856
00:38:22.34 --> 00:38:24.14
I'm going to the book here.

857
00:38:24.14 --> 00:38:28.62
Staff Sergeant Canific was standing outside a bunker about 100 feet from me.

858
00:38:28.62 --> 00:38:30.42
My or were under attack yield.

859
00:38:30.42 --> 00:38:33.54
Technically yes, but the shepherd, there's some shepherd out there, but the shepherd

860
00:38:33.54 --> 00:38:35.74
was shooting without poking his head up to aim.

861
00:38:35.74 --> 00:38:37.82
He had one chance in a thousand of hitting us.

862
00:38:37.82 --> 00:38:42.38
A second harmless, harmless burst followed the bullets cracking more than 10 feet above

863
00:38:42.38 --> 00:38:43.38
our head.

864
00:38:43.38 --> 00:38:44.50
Call for already now.

865
00:38:44.50 --> 00:38:49.38
Staff Sergeant Canific yelled holding the radio out, head, head set out towards me.

866
00:38:49.38 --> 00:38:50.38
Oh nice.

867
00:38:50.38 --> 00:38:55.10
Staff Sergeant soon to be gunnery sergeant Canific needed the lowly corporal's help.

868
00:38:55.10 --> 00:38:57.10
I trotted toward him, stopped.

869
00:38:57.10 --> 00:39:02.14
Assumed parade rest postures armed lock behind my back, chest pushed forward and the

870
00:39:02.14 --> 00:39:06.94
wide open and paced into respectful expression on my face.

871
00:39:06.94 --> 00:39:10.50
What does the staff sergeant wish the corporal to do?

872
00:39:10.50 --> 00:39:11.78
Another burst from the AK.

873
00:39:11.78 --> 00:39:13.94
This is no time to be a smart ass, Meyer.

874
00:39:13.94 --> 00:39:15.78
A few more rounds still wait too high.

875
00:39:15.78 --> 00:39:16.98
I'm locked at parade rest.

876
00:39:16.98 --> 00:39:18.74
I staff sergeant.

877
00:39:18.74 --> 00:39:21.38
He balanced the headset considering whether to throw that me.

878
00:39:21.38 --> 00:39:22.86
Meyer hurry up.

879
00:39:22.86 --> 00:39:27.26
He had started calling in the artillery mission and when I got to him, he was asking me,

880
00:39:27.26 --> 00:39:28.58
what do I say now?

881
00:39:28.58 --> 00:39:31.70
Left 100 dropped 200, I said he repeated it on the radio.

882
00:39:31.70 --> 00:39:32.70
What now?

883
00:39:32.70 --> 00:39:33.70
He asked, fire for effect.

884
00:39:33.70 --> 00:39:35.42
I said, should be dead on.

885
00:39:35.42 --> 00:39:40.18
Okay, fire for effect, he repeated over the radio.

886
00:39:40.18 --> 00:39:41.18
That's it.

887
00:39:41.18 --> 00:39:47.42
I'm gonna hit the guy, but it's funny that you even in that situation, you were talking

888
00:39:47.42 --> 00:39:49.70
about being a kind of a wise ass when you're a kid.

889
00:39:49.70 --> 00:39:51.34
You're still a wise ass.

890
00:39:51.34 --> 00:39:54.50
Yeah, you know, the thing about Kenneth Dick was, me and him were buttonheads.

891
00:39:54.50 --> 00:39:55.50
Real hard.

892
00:39:55.50 --> 00:39:57.98
At that time, we were buttonheads.

893
00:39:57.98 --> 00:40:01.90
You know how some people would just take over, like he took over and tried to make

894
00:40:01.90 --> 00:40:04.14
up for his lack of nothing against him.

895
00:40:04.14 --> 00:40:08.30
He wasn't a combat, I mean, it wasn't his job, but what he tried to make up for in the

896
00:40:08.30 --> 00:40:11.18
lack of his combat knowledge was his authority, right?

897
00:40:11.18 --> 00:40:17.50
And so, he had kind of pissed me off pretty bad about asking me to do, you know, you

898
00:40:17.50 --> 00:40:18.50
can you stand a parade dress?

899
00:40:18.50 --> 00:40:20.30
He was all big on it, right?

900
00:40:20.30 --> 00:40:22.30
And it's like we're on a cop.

901
00:40:22.30 --> 00:40:26.58
You know, you still need to, you know, customs and courtesy, right?

902
00:40:26.58 --> 00:40:29.78
And so I got used that situation to make a point.

903
00:40:29.78 --> 00:40:31.90
He just kind of pushed me over the edge.

904
00:40:31.90 --> 00:40:34.06
But after that, we were, yeah, that's a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of

905
00:40:34.06 --> 00:40:35.06
brody guy's up, right?

906
00:40:35.06 --> 00:40:36.06
Yeah, brody guy's up, right?

907
00:40:36.06 --> 00:40:37.06
Yeah, brody guy's up, right?

908
00:40:37.06 --> 00:40:38.06
Yeah, that's all, that's great.

909
00:40:38.06 --> 00:40:39.82
You had some good afghan soldiers in there.

910
00:40:39.82 --> 00:40:43.94
You were talking to me about them, early one guy, the by the name of Dodd, Oli.

911
00:40:43.94 --> 00:40:44.94
Here you go.

912
00:40:44.94 --> 00:40:48.30
He was fun to talk to, open, friendly and fearless.

913
00:40:48.30 --> 00:40:51.30
We'd sit around talking and asking questions of each other, like kids in middle school,

914
00:40:51.30 --> 00:40:53.06
learning as much as we could about each other.

915
00:40:53.06 --> 00:40:56.86
He proudly cleaned his saw five times a day and absorbed every tip by giving them about

916
00:40:56.86 --> 00:40:57.86
shooting.

917
00:40:57.86 --> 00:40:59.94
He was the most disciplined ass car on base.

918
00:40:59.94 --> 00:41:01.74
That's why we gave him the saw on the first place.

919
00:41:01.74 --> 00:41:03.74
So you had good relationship with that.

920
00:41:03.74 --> 00:41:06.50
Yeah, I mean, I had a good relationship with all my afgans.

921
00:41:06.50 --> 00:41:10.98
I mean, I, I, I, I, I, at least two meals a day with them.

922
00:41:10.98 --> 00:41:13.46
Um, you know, usually I didn't eat breakfast with them.

923
00:41:13.46 --> 00:41:17.82
I would eat it over at the, uh, over at the, uh, you know, the childhood.

924
00:41:17.82 --> 00:41:20.18
But I used, you know, that was my, that was my policy.

925
00:41:20.18 --> 00:41:23.58
I mean, every night, I dinner with them every single night.

926
00:41:23.58 --> 00:41:26.98
I would eat dinner with my afgans soldiers, because I was no better than them.

927
00:41:26.98 --> 00:41:27.98
Yeah, man.

928
00:41:27.98 --> 00:41:33.22
You know, sometimes I hear, I hear people, you know, people that don't understand at

929
00:41:33.22 --> 00:41:38.54
all what was going on in Iraq or Afghanistan, they'll, you know, we were, you know,

930
00:41:38.54 --> 00:41:40.54
America was occupiers and oxygen.

931
00:41:40.54 --> 00:41:44.46
And it's like I always remind them like we were fighting alongside the Iraqi soldiers,

932
00:41:44.46 --> 00:41:46.26
fighting alongside the afgans soldiers.

933
00:41:46.26 --> 00:41:47.26
Yeah.

934
00:41:47.26 --> 00:41:48.26
I mean, spilling blood.

935
00:41:48.26 --> 00:41:51.02
Yeah, I mean, we weren't, I mean, just because it was Iraq and Afghanistan,

936
00:41:51.02 --> 00:41:53.82
war, we weren't fighting Iraq and Afghanistan.

937
00:41:53.82 --> 00:41:55.70
We were fighting with them.

938
00:41:55.70 --> 00:41:57.86
We weren't fighting against Iraq or Afghanistan.

939
00:41:57.86 --> 00:41:58.86
Yeah.

940
00:41:58.86 --> 00:41:59.86
We were fighting next to them.

941
00:41:59.86 --> 00:42:02.46
You know, we were helping them against the same enemy.

942
00:42:02.46 --> 00:42:03.46
Yeah.

943
00:42:03.46 --> 00:42:05.06
You know, so many people miss that point, man.

944
00:42:05.06 --> 00:42:08.42
And it's a, it's an important point to be missing.

945
00:42:08.42 --> 00:42:11.42
It's a, it's a, it's a big, it's a big fact.

946
00:42:11.42 --> 00:42:12.42
Yeah.

947
00:42:12.42 --> 00:42:16.18
Man, I hear that and it just turns my stomach, man.

948
00:42:16.18 --> 00:42:20.46
Um, now I kind of joked about that first situation being your first combat.

949
00:42:20.46 --> 00:42:23.46
And now you had legit your first kind of trial by fire.

950
00:42:23.46 --> 00:42:24.46
Yeah.

951
00:42:24.46 --> 00:42:26.46
Um, you're at combat.

952
00:42:26.46 --> 00:42:30.26
You're at the outpost at cop, Monti, and you're under attack.

953
00:42:30.26 --> 00:42:33.38
You actually got some wounded, some ass cars are wounded.

954
00:42:33.38 --> 00:42:36.38
And you're, you're going back to the book where's that, where's that sergeant can't

955
00:42:36.38 --> 00:42:37.38
affect I yelled.

956
00:42:37.38 --> 00:42:39.18
Doc Laitton pointed toward the northeast tower.

957
00:42:39.18 --> 00:42:40.22
Get over there and stay with him.

958
00:42:40.22 --> 00:42:45.02
I yelled suicide bombers sometimes rush the wire trying to take and take an infidel with

959
00:42:45.02 --> 00:42:48.42
them as they evaporated in a red flash without hesitating.

960
00:42:48.42 --> 00:42:52.14
Doc Laitton ran down the stairs across the open space and into the tower with staff sergeant

961
00:42:52.14 --> 00:42:57.26
to kind of fake two or three seconds later, a rocket slammed into their bunker exploding

962
00:42:57.26 --> 00:43:02.66
into pieces and a half grand worker huddled there behind beside the sandbags smoke rolled

963
00:43:02.66 --> 00:43:04.14
out of the tower.

964
00:43:04.14 --> 00:43:05.14
They're gone.

965
00:43:05.14 --> 00:43:07.62
I yelled the Johnson not believing what I just seen.

966
00:43:07.62 --> 00:43:08.62
I resumed firing.

967
00:43:08.62 --> 00:43:09.98
It's all you can do.

968
00:43:09.98 --> 00:43:14.18
The best first aid at that point was to return fire.

969
00:43:14.18 --> 00:43:16.06
Johnson worked the radio.

970
00:43:16.06 --> 00:43:18.18
Fox 3-1, Fox 3-1, this is Fox 3.

971
00:43:18.18 --> 00:43:21.42
Staff Sergeant Kenneth Fick, Doc Laitton, come on, answer up.

972
00:43:21.42 --> 00:43:24.58
We kept firing, but it seemed unwirledly now.

973
00:43:24.58 --> 00:43:25.58
We were on automatic.

974
00:43:25.58 --> 00:43:27.58
The Johnson got on the radio again.

975
00:43:27.58 --> 00:43:30.54
3-1, Fox 3-1, this is Fox 3.

976
00:43:30.54 --> 00:43:34.54
Staff Sergeant Kenneth Fick, Doc Laitton, come on, answer up.

977
00:43:34.54 --> 00:43:35.54
Then finally.

978
00:43:35.54 --> 00:43:37.82
Yeah, yeah, this is 3-1.

979
00:43:37.82 --> 00:43:39.22
We're good.

980
00:43:39.22 --> 00:43:43.94
Ten minutes later, our attack helicopters began strafing runs low rumbling birds like

981
00:43:43.94 --> 00:43:45.78
a giant burping.

982
00:43:45.78 --> 00:43:50.94
Incredible firepower, those lovely birds, enemy fire ceased attack over.

983
00:43:50.94 --> 00:43:54.46
Johnson and I ran over to the bunker and staff sergeant, Kenneth Fick, Doc Laitton, stumbled

984
00:43:54.46 --> 00:43:55.46
out.

985
00:43:55.46 --> 00:43:59.58
Four of a set on the bloody sandbags and the growing dust talking about it.

986
00:43:59.58 --> 00:44:03.50
Their eyes were slightly glazed and wide wide open.

987
00:44:03.50 --> 00:44:08.66
Lieutenant Johnson, Staff Sergeant Kenneth Fick, Doc Laitton, weren't infantry.

988
00:44:08.66 --> 00:44:12.74
They had considered that by coming to Afghanistan they might die, but it hadn't kicked in

989
00:44:12.74 --> 00:44:14.58
until now.

990
00:44:14.58 --> 00:44:17.30
Now they had heard the screams and seen the blood.

991
00:44:17.30 --> 00:44:23.10
Everybody stood covered understood now that if we went home together it might not be alive.

992
00:44:23.10 --> 00:44:27.66
The askers were cleaning up the bloody mess, not six feet from us, taking away the rip-up

993
00:44:27.66 --> 00:44:30.06
body of their friend.

994
00:44:30.06 --> 00:44:31.74
We mumbled some stuff.

995
00:44:31.74 --> 00:44:34.98
All of us were too embarrassed to talk about our feelings, but we knew what we were all

996
00:44:34.98 --> 00:44:35.98
thinking.

997
00:44:35.98 --> 00:44:40.26
This shit was for real and there were only four of us.

998
00:44:40.26 --> 00:44:41.58
We'll be there for each other.

999
00:44:41.58 --> 00:44:45.90
Doc Laitton said, the surfer dude surprised me.

1000
00:44:45.90 --> 00:44:48.54
He had said the one thing that made any sense.

1001
00:44:48.54 --> 00:44:52.54
Yeah.

1002
00:44:52.54 --> 00:45:00.06
That was the Sunday before.

1003
00:45:00.06 --> 00:45:02.78
So Gange Ghal was on a Tuesday.

1004
00:45:02.78 --> 00:45:05.82
That was September 6th of 2009.

1005
00:45:05.82 --> 00:45:08.06
There was a huge rocket attack.

1006
00:45:08.06 --> 00:45:09.06
I mean they were dialed in.

1007
00:45:09.06 --> 00:45:10.06
It was terrible.

1008
00:45:10.06 --> 00:45:12.34
I can remember it as if I was there.

1009
00:45:12.34 --> 00:45:13.34
It was terrible.

1010
00:45:13.34 --> 00:45:15.06
How many rockets did it fire?

1011
00:45:15.06 --> 00:45:18.58
I think we had nine, the 107th.

1012
00:45:18.58 --> 00:45:26.26
It hit dead on, just nine that hit inside of not the whole base, but just my afghan base.

1013
00:45:26.26 --> 00:45:31.98
That's probably what we're at right now is probably bigger than that.

1014
00:45:31.98 --> 00:45:33.78
It was terrible.

1015
00:45:33.78 --> 00:45:35.82
That was a wake-up call.

1016
00:45:35.82 --> 00:45:38.22
It was for all of us.

1017
00:45:38.22 --> 00:45:39.22
It was for all of us.

1018
00:45:39.22 --> 00:45:40.22
It was for them.

1019
00:45:40.22 --> 00:45:44.94
I'll never forget.

1020
00:45:44.94 --> 00:45:45.94
I'll never forget.

1021
00:45:45.94 --> 00:45:49.54
I mean we finally said, I talked about what do we do, if we lose one of it, what do we

1022
00:45:49.54 --> 00:45:51.54
want?

1023
00:45:51.54 --> 00:45:54.46
Gosh, it was so real.

1024
00:45:54.46 --> 00:46:03.94
I had met a back-to-out guy, the wounded soldier that day.

1025
00:46:03.94 --> 00:46:07.14
He was put me in for a bronze star.

1026
00:46:07.14 --> 00:46:08.14
I'm there for Gidey.

1027
00:46:08.14 --> 00:46:14.66
We were walking through in the little hooch and he said, where we lived at.

1028
00:46:14.66 --> 00:46:16.98
He was just kind of joking a little bit later on that day.

1029
00:46:16.98 --> 00:46:22.14
He was like, hey, the way shit's going for you and it's unlucky as you are, he goes, you'll

1030
00:46:22.14 --> 00:46:26.66
probably be in for a metal honor before this deployment's over with.

1031
00:46:26.66 --> 00:46:30.58
It's just crazy.

1032
00:46:30.58 --> 00:46:35.98
That's two days before you guys had down to Gondra Gaul.

1033
00:46:35.98 --> 00:46:39.02
We'd actually got to call that night that we were supposed to go to Gondra Gaul in the

1034
00:46:39.02 --> 00:46:40.02
7th.

1035
00:46:40.02 --> 00:46:44.42
And they ended up pushing it right to the 8th.

1036
00:46:44.42 --> 00:46:46.14
So we left the next day.

1037
00:46:46.14 --> 00:46:47.70
We talked about a little bit here.

1038
00:46:47.70 --> 00:46:52.66
Gondra Gaul laid two miles north of Joyce and we drove right by the mouth of the valley.

1039
00:46:52.66 --> 00:46:58.38
Gondra Gaul sounded like the name of an Irish town full of smiling faces and friendly pubs.

1040
00:46:58.38 --> 00:47:03.22
I could see a few of the larger compounds far back on a hillside nestled against steep

1041
00:47:03.22 --> 00:47:05.14
ridge lines.

1042
00:47:05.14 --> 00:47:08.54
Bad place, half as muddered, bad people.

1043
00:47:08.54 --> 00:47:10.54
So you're getting right away getting told.

1044
00:47:10.54 --> 00:47:12.34
No, I mean, we were told instantly.

1045
00:47:12.34 --> 00:47:17.62
I mean, we were told like, I mean, we, I mean, yeah, there was no doubt.

1046
00:47:17.62 --> 00:47:21.14
Now one thing that I think made you feel more comfortable, a little bit more comfortable

1047
00:47:21.14 --> 00:47:23.26
you talk about in the book.

1048
00:47:23.26 --> 00:47:26.90
Historically, the Taliban had not sprung ambushes from inside villages.

1049
00:47:26.90 --> 00:47:28.98
So that wasn't discussed at the briefing.

1050
00:47:28.98 --> 00:47:34.74
Plus we were going in with 90 Afghans and 15 advisors with a bulltune from 1-3-2 deployed

1051
00:47:34.74 --> 00:47:37.66
behind us in a quick reaction force.

1052
00:47:37.66 --> 00:47:42.74
This shows us this show belongs to the to our Afghan counterparts.

1053
00:47:42.74 --> 00:47:43.98
Fabio, I'm saying that right.

1054
00:47:43.98 --> 00:47:44.98
Fabio.

1055
00:47:44.98 --> 00:47:50.54
Fabio said, we advisor will stand off to the side and let them talk with the elders.

1056
00:47:50.54 --> 00:47:51.38
We're not in the lead.

1057
00:47:51.38 --> 00:47:52.66
We're assisting.

1058
00:47:52.66 --> 00:47:56.38
That made no sense, I thought, considering who is doing the briefing and who is hearing

1059
00:47:56.38 --> 00:48:01.38
it, we were in the tactical lead even if we claimed otherwise.

1060
00:48:01.38 --> 00:48:03.38
That's a political thing.

1061
00:48:03.38 --> 00:48:07.62
Yeah, I mean, I, I think it's an ignorant thing.

1062
00:48:07.62 --> 00:48:10.46
Well, I think it's an ignorant thing too, but the reason it happened.

1063
00:48:10.46 --> 00:48:11.46
No, no, of course.

1064
00:48:11.46 --> 00:48:13.02
I mean, technically we fail under.

1065
00:48:13.02 --> 00:48:17.30
So I mean, technically the way that this works is crazy is this sounds.

1066
00:48:17.30 --> 00:48:20.66
I was working for like my commander was Afghan commander.

1067
00:48:20.66 --> 00:48:23.50
Whatever the Afghan commander told me was what I was supposed to do.

1068
00:48:23.50 --> 00:48:24.50
Right.

1069
00:48:24.50 --> 00:48:28.14
I mean, I'm saying that's a political thing for us to say politically, look, the Afghans

1070
00:48:28.14 --> 00:48:29.14
are running this operation.

1071
00:48:29.14 --> 00:48:30.14
Yes, yes, yes.

1072
00:48:30.14 --> 00:48:34.86
I mean, that, you know, but that, if you remember what I said a little bit earlier about,

1073
00:48:34.86 --> 00:48:36.74
you know, hey, we're not going to do the fighting.

1074
00:48:36.74 --> 00:48:40.54
I mean, that, that's the mentality of the leadership of team.

1075
00:48:40.54 --> 00:48:41.54
Yeah.

1076
00:48:44.34 --> 00:48:46.82
Yeah, not good.

1077
00:48:46.82 --> 00:48:49.38
Then as you just said here, that that made no sense.

1078
00:48:49.38 --> 00:48:52.82
I thought, and you were a corporal 20, how old were you?

1079
00:48:52.82 --> 00:48:57.18
I was 21, 21 years old, and you're looking at this going to hey man, this doesn't make any sense.

1080
00:48:57.18 --> 00:48:59.02
We're the ones that are sitting here briefing it.

1081
00:48:59.02 --> 00:49:01.78
We know where the ones that know how to call for fire.

1082
00:49:01.78 --> 00:49:05.62
Yeah, I mean, and I brought, I mean, first off, first off, the Afghans can't even

1083
00:49:05.62 --> 00:49:07.82
talk to anybody that calls for fire or the helicopters.

1084
00:49:07.82 --> 00:49:10.46
I mean, they don't even have any comms with them.

1085
00:49:10.46 --> 00:49:11.46
They're on HF.

1086
00:49:11.46 --> 00:49:13.46
Yeah, you know what I mean?

1087
00:49:13.46 --> 00:49:14.46
Yeah.

1088
00:49:14.46 --> 00:49:21.18
I mean, I, so the three main factors that I brought up in the brief, and I brought up

1089
00:49:21.18 --> 00:49:23.38
it, look, we're only, everybody's going in.

1090
00:49:23.38 --> 00:49:27.46
We have over 12 different moving elements between the OPs and different teams inside this

1091
00:49:27.46 --> 00:49:31.86
patrol, all in one frequency.

1092
00:49:31.86 --> 00:49:32.86
I brought that up.

1093
00:49:32.86 --> 00:49:37.74
I brought up the fact that we didn't have direct air supporters on 15-minute strippler,

1094
00:49:37.74 --> 00:49:39.18
and that's in Jalalabad.

1095
00:49:39.18 --> 00:49:43.82
So they were taking it as if the birds would be there within 15 minutes.

1096
00:49:43.82 --> 00:49:46.26
I said, that's not what 15-minute strippler means.

1097
00:49:46.26 --> 00:49:50.98
That means all the ground in 15 minutes, and then they still got 90, probably 60 minutes

1098
00:49:50.98 --> 00:49:53.62
to get from Jalalabad to us.

1099
00:49:53.62 --> 00:49:58.78
And so that was the other factor in the other thing that I brought up was why would we

1100
00:49:58.78 --> 00:50:04.02
put our snipers, 2,000 meters away from the village outside of their effective range

1101
00:50:04.02 --> 00:50:05.02
in the weapons.

1102
00:50:05.02 --> 00:50:06.02
There you go.

1103
00:50:06.02 --> 00:50:07.02
But here's what I was told.

1104
00:50:07.02 --> 00:50:09.22
I'm in E4 in the United States Marine Corps.

1105
00:50:09.22 --> 00:50:12.22
What do I know about mission planning?

1106
00:50:12.22 --> 00:50:14.22
And that's why I was taking out the team.

1107
00:50:14.22 --> 00:50:16.22
Chuck.

1108
00:50:16.22 --> 00:50:22.06
So when you say, when you talk about getting taken out of the team, explain how that went

1109
00:50:22.06 --> 00:50:23.06
down a little bit.

1110
00:50:23.06 --> 00:50:24.86
So you got your former team?

1111
00:50:24.86 --> 00:50:25.86
Team Monty.

1112
00:50:25.86 --> 00:50:26.86
Yeah, team Monty.

1113
00:50:26.86 --> 00:50:33.06
What they did was, they had, they put the teams, you would go with your Afghans in

1114
00:50:33.06 --> 00:50:36.78
here to do their part.

1115
00:50:36.78 --> 00:50:41.38
So our team was supposed to go to the back of the village, cover the backside of it, and

1116
00:50:41.38 --> 00:50:44.26
then we were going to search a couple of house up there for a machine gun.

1117
00:50:44.26 --> 00:50:49.50
And while the meeting went on, and they took me out of the team because I brought up those

1118
00:50:49.50 --> 00:50:51.50
concerns.

1119
00:50:51.50 --> 00:50:57.86
And they kind of took it as me going against the orders, questioning their authority, and

1120
00:50:57.86 --> 00:51:02.30
they replaced me with gunny Johnson.

1121
00:51:02.30 --> 00:51:04.14
So I'm just, I just have to say this right now.

1122
00:51:04.14 --> 00:51:06.70
So I talk about this all the time.

1123
00:51:06.70 --> 00:51:09.74
If you're in a leadership position, you don't want Yesmen.

1124
00:51:09.74 --> 00:51:10.74
You don't want Yesmen.

1125
00:51:10.74 --> 00:51:14.38
You want the corporal that says, hey boss, I don't understand why you do that right

1126
00:51:14.38 --> 00:51:15.38
now.

1127
00:51:15.38 --> 00:51:20.46
And if you're answer to your subordinate is because I said so, or it's you're an E4,

1128
00:51:20.46 --> 00:51:22.54
be quiet, or you're an E5, be quiet.

1129
00:51:22.54 --> 00:51:25.62
If that's what your answer is, that means you don't have a real answer.

1130
00:51:25.62 --> 00:51:29.18
That means that what you're doing is probably wrong.

1131
00:51:29.18 --> 00:51:33.34
So surround yourself, the best people you can have in your team are the people that are

1132
00:51:33.34 --> 00:51:36.06
going to question what what it is that you're your plan is.

1133
00:51:36.06 --> 00:51:39.62
And if they question it and you can't don't have a good logical answer and your plan

1134
00:51:39.62 --> 00:51:45.42
doesn't stand on its own two feet, well think about it and reassess it and take some advice

1135
00:51:45.42 --> 00:51:49.58
from down the chain of command on how what we could do to change this plan up.

1136
00:51:49.58 --> 00:51:55.06
I mean it was, look, they're complacent.

1137
00:51:55.06 --> 00:52:00.50
That's the type of mentality you have when you don't expect to go get your ass handed to you.

1138
00:52:00.50 --> 00:52:03.90
That's why you need to expect to get your ass handed to you every day and train like

1139
00:52:03.90 --> 00:52:04.90
it.

1140
00:52:04.90 --> 00:52:05.90
Yeah.

1141
00:52:05.90 --> 00:52:10.34
You know, when I was running training we trained for worst case scenario all the time.

1142
00:52:10.34 --> 00:52:11.34
It was like worst.

1143
00:52:11.34 --> 00:52:12.34
You know what?

1144
00:52:12.34 --> 00:52:14.14
And it was insane.

1145
00:52:14.14 --> 00:52:20.06
Like we had great financing for our training so the training was awesome.

1146
00:52:20.06 --> 00:52:21.46
We had mayhem going on.

1147
00:52:21.46 --> 00:52:25.90
We had paint balls and we had laser, this multi-million dollar laser tag system.

1148
00:52:25.90 --> 00:52:30.86
We had role players and it was awesome and I wanted mayhem and we would put guys down

1149
00:52:30.86 --> 00:52:35.10
and you'd have to carry them out and it would be like, we'd be mayhem.

1150
00:52:35.10 --> 00:52:38.14
And sometimes guys go, this is kind of unrealistic and what are the chances of this really

1151
00:52:38.14 --> 00:52:39.14
happening?

1152
00:52:39.14 --> 00:52:40.14
Yeah.

1153
00:52:40.14 --> 00:52:42.86
And I'd be like, look, if this doesn't happen, great.

1154
00:52:42.86 --> 00:52:44.58
You don't ever have to worry about it happen for real.

1155
00:52:44.58 --> 00:52:47.30
But if it happens, you'll be ready for it.

1156
00:52:47.30 --> 00:52:48.94
At least as ready as you can be.

1157
00:52:48.94 --> 00:52:48.94
Yeah.

1158
00:52:48.94 --> 00:52:54.50
So you get pulled off the team.

1159
00:52:54.50 --> 00:52:57.98
I got pulled off the team and my job was going to be to stay with the vehicle.

1160
00:52:57.98 --> 00:53:00.78
So like basically we were going to drive vehicles and park the vehicle.

1161
00:53:00.78 --> 00:53:02.14
Now it was the other thing I said.

1162
00:53:02.14 --> 00:53:03.46
I said, this is dumb.

1163
00:53:03.46 --> 00:53:10.34
Why would we leave our up armor guns a couple miles away?

1164
00:53:10.34 --> 00:53:13.42
And they said, you ready for the response here?

1165
00:53:13.42 --> 00:53:14.42
You ready?

1166
00:53:14.42 --> 00:53:16.90
Well, Dakota.

1167
00:53:16.90 --> 00:53:21.78
Because if we want to go into the village, clandestine, you have a 90-man patrol.

1168
00:53:21.78 --> 00:53:22.78
Yeah.

1169
00:53:22.78 --> 00:53:23.78
Yeah.

1170
00:53:23.78 --> 00:53:25.62
That's not going to happen.

1171
00:53:25.62 --> 00:53:26.98
Just a paint depiction for everyone.

1172
00:53:26.98 --> 00:53:32.82
Basically, there's a deep ravine walls on either side at the top of the ravine.

1173
00:53:32.82 --> 00:53:37.02
It kind of splits into two other ravines and there's kind of villages on both sides of that.

1174
00:53:37.02 --> 00:53:38.02
Yeah.

1175
00:53:38.02 --> 00:53:41.70
It splits into two, like it's kind of like two valleys inside of a big valley.

1176
00:53:41.70 --> 00:53:42.70
Right.

1177
00:53:42.70 --> 00:53:45.86
On the right hand side was another bad valley, but we were going in the left hand side when

1178
00:53:45.86 --> 00:53:47.74
that was Gangegar.

1179
00:53:47.74 --> 00:53:52.42
And I mean, this this terrain was built to fight.

1180
00:53:52.42 --> 00:53:53.42
It was built to fight.

1181
00:53:53.42 --> 00:53:55.66
I mean, they had trenches in it.

1182
00:53:55.66 --> 00:53:59.26
The trenches in it that they used to fight out of.

1183
00:53:59.26 --> 00:54:01.38
It's not.

1184
00:54:01.38 --> 00:54:05.02
And obviously you're walking up the valley, which means automatically you're in the

1185
00:54:05.02 --> 00:54:08.74
low ground, which is not where we want to be ever.

1186
00:54:08.74 --> 00:54:11.54
All right.

1187
00:54:11.54 --> 00:54:18.82
Now you, the one of the guys you were going to be working with in the hummers was staff

1188
00:54:18.82 --> 00:54:21.62
Sergeant Juan Rodriguez Chavez.

1189
00:54:21.62 --> 00:54:22.62
Here we go back to the book.

1190
00:54:22.62 --> 00:54:23.62
I saw it out.

1191
00:54:23.62 --> 00:54:28.94
Staff Sergeant Juan Rodriguez Chavez, our motor transport chief.

1192
00:54:28.94 --> 00:54:30.58
I know them for five months.

1193
00:54:30.58 --> 00:54:34.18
He didn't stand on the rank and we traded stories about growing up on farms.

1194
00:54:34.18 --> 00:54:37.62
He had grown up on a ranch in Mexico, having a similar approach to life.

1195
00:54:37.62 --> 00:54:39.66
Rod Nye had been come friends.

1196
00:54:39.66 --> 00:54:43.58
He was in the eighth grade when his family moved to Texas where he learned English played football

1197
00:54:43.58 --> 00:54:47.10
earned good grades and roped cows and rodeos.

1198
00:54:47.10 --> 00:54:48.86
Our team called him hot rod.

1199
00:54:48.86 --> 00:54:52.82
He laughed a lot, bragged about how smart his two daughters were and kept all our vehicles

1200
00:54:52.82 --> 00:54:54.62
in top condition.

1201
00:54:54.62 --> 00:54:56.22
Rod, this mission is fucked up.

1202
00:54:56.22 --> 00:54:58.98
If the shit at the fan I said, we're going in.

1203
00:54:58.98 --> 00:55:02.86
My team's walking point and they'll get cut off.

1204
00:55:02.86 --> 00:55:06.38
We have to go in and get them out.

1205
00:55:06.38 --> 00:55:08.66
And he looked back at you.

1206
00:55:08.66 --> 00:55:14.38
Devil dog, Rod said, say the word and I'll do the driving.

1207
00:55:14.38 --> 00:55:17.02
That's legit.

1208
00:55:17.02 --> 00:55:18.22
He's the man.

1209
00:55:18.22 --> 00:55:20.98
He's the man.

1210
00:55:20.98 --> 00:55:25.66
And continuing on, you say having some sort of contingency plan now I walked back to the

1211
00:55:25.66 --> 00:55:27.70
advisor headquarters and briefed Lieutenant Johnson.

1212
00:55:27.70 --> 00:55:30.06
By the way, Lieutenant Johnson didn't want you out of the team either, right?

1213
00:55:30.06 --> 00:55:31.06
He wanted you stay with.

1214
00:55:31.06 --> 00:55:32.22
He can't figure a pist.

1215
00:55:32.22 --> 00:55:36.38
He knew that you should be with the team.

1216
00:55:36.38 --> 00:55:38.46
The things you hear me, I said, I'm coming in.

1217
00:55:38.46 --> 00:55:39.46
Rod will drive.

1218
00:55:39.46 --> 00:55:41.94
Radio your coordinates and get down to the wash.

1219
00:55:41.94 --> 00:55:44.94
Fucking climb in and we'll haul us back to the main body because they were going to be

1220
00:55:44.94 --> 00:55:46.90
exposed on the far end of that wall.

1221
00:55:46.90 --> 00:55:51.86
Yeah, so everything that I did was planned out the night before.

1222
00:55:51.86 --> 00:55:53.18
Chuck.

1223
00:55:53.18 --> 00:55:56.54
Everything that I did was planned out the night before.

1224
00:55:56.54 --> 00:55:57.54
And it was all in our team.

1225
00:55:57.54 --> 00:55:58.54
I mean, I told him.

1226
00:55:58.54 --> 00:56:01.74
I told him, I said, you know, you say the word and I'll head in there.

1227
00:56:01.74 --> 00:56:02.74
I don't care.

1228
00:56:02.74 --> 00:56:04.14
I'm coming to get you.

1229
00:56:04.14 --> 00:56:06.90
And I mean, that we had this all planned out.

1230
00:56:06.90 --> 00:56:13.26
Like all they had to do was get to the road and I would be there.

1231
00:56:13.26 --> 00:56:19.54
Continuing on back to the book in the talk, a report about Gondrigal had come in via Brigade

1232
00:56:19.54 --> 00:56:24.30
Internet, a special forces team reported that 32 fighters were moving from Pakistan to reinforce

1233
00:56:24.30 --> 00:56:26.02
Gondrigal.

1234
00:56:26.02 --> 00:56:29.74
Half an hour later, the video feed from an unmanned aerial vehicle showed a man with

1235
00:56:29.74 --> 00:56:34.38
a mortar tube on his back and ring a known safe house to kilometers north of Gondrigal village

1236
00:56:34.38 --> 00:56:37.22
10 minutes later, four more men entered the same house.

1237
00:56:37.22 --> 00:56:38.98
So you're watching this.

1238
00:56:38.98 --> 00:56:39.98
What?

1239
00:56:39.98 --> 00:56:41.62
So here's the crazy part.

1240
00:56:41.62 --> 00:56:42.98
Nobody told us.

1241
00:56:42.98 --> 00:56:44.98
Oh, so you didn't even get that report.

1242
00:56:44.98 --> 00:56:46.98
Nobody told us.

1243
00:56:46.98 --> 00:56:51.62
Chuck, um, and I got to point out to everyone.

1244
00:56:51.62 --> 00:56:54.94
I'm obviously skipping giant chunks of this book.

1245
00:56:54.94 --> 00:57:01.70
And there's a awesome amount of detail that that Dakota goes into and how this is going

1246
00:57:01.70 --> 00:57:02.70
down.

1247
00:57:02.70 --> 00:57:05.74
And I'm kind of hitting the wave tops to get to get the story there.

1248
00:57:05.74 --> 00:57:11.02
But, uh, okay, you don't even get that intel, but doesn't matter because the next

1249
00:57:11.02 --> 00:57:14.02
day, I guess, where you're going into the valley.

1250
00:57:14.02 --> 00:57:17.10
Um, you got a guy with you named Swenson.

1251
00:57:17.10 --> 00:57:18.58
He's in charge of some border police.

1252
00:57:18.58 --> 00:57:19.58
I'm Afghan border police.

1253
00:57:19.58 --> 00:57:20.58
Is that right?

1254
00:57:20.58 --> 00:57:21.58
Yeah.

1255
00:57:21.58 --> 00:57:27.46
Swenson's border police turned to half as when the lights went out.

1256
00:57:27.46 --> 00:57:28.46
Dushman, he said.

1257
00:57:28.46 --> 00:57:29.46
And I said that right.

1258
00:57:29.46 --> 00:57:33.82
Dushman, Dushman, Dushman, which is another term for enemy for enemy.

1259
00:57:33.82 --> 00:57:36.26
Dushman, they said, we must turn back.

1260
00:57:36.26 --> 00:57:37.50
So they're already freaking out.

1261
00:57:37.50 --> 00:57:38.50
Yeah.

1262
00:57:38.50 --> 00:57:43.10
So they, I think, uh, I think that they were, they were, uh, like, some of the police had

1263
00:57:43.10 --> 00:57:44.10
already knew they had leaked.

1264
00:57:44.10 --> 00:57:45.10
Oh, tipped it off.

1265
00:57:45.10 --> 00:57:46.10
Yeah.

1266
00:57:46.10 --> 00:57:48.82
They had had information one way to get leaked when we were coming in.

1267
00:57:48.82 --> 00:57:49.82
They had leaked a plan.

1268
00:57:49.82 --> 00:57:50.82
Yeah.

1269
00:57:50.82 --> 00:57:54.38
So I think that that's why they were trying to bail out in my opinion because they knew

1270
00:57:54.38 --> 00:57:55.38
it was already there.

1271
00:57:55.38 --> 00:57:56.38
Bit, yeah.

1272
00:57:56.38 --> 00:57:58.18
It's got it.

1273
00:57:58.18 --> 00:58:02.62
And just before five in the morning, Rod and I heard gravel crunching on the

1274
00:58:02.62 --> 00:58:03.62
treason.

1275
00:58:03.62 --> 00:58:04.46
Now you're actually in position.

1276
00:58:04.46 --> 00:58:10.34
You dropped off the guys and now the Afghan team with some of the advisors, including

1277
00:58:10.34 --> 00:58:14.02
team months, you're heading up the valley and you're waiting at the bottom end of the

1278
00:58:14.02 --> 00:58:15.02
valley.

1279
00:58:15.02 --> 00:58:16.02
Yeah.

1280
00:58:16.02 --> 00:58:17.14
I'm sitting back to, you know, back the trucks and they're going, you know, they're

1281
00:58:17.14 --> 00:58:18.66
going into the valley.

1282
00:58:18.66 --> 00:58:21.78
And, um, yeah, at this point now everybody's leaving the valley.

1283
00:58:21.78 --> 00:58:26.62
Yeah, this, this part, just before five in the morning, Rod and I heard gravel crunching

1284
00:58:26.62 --> 00:58:31.94
on the trail, men, women, children, sheep and goats suddenly hurried by our trucks heading

1285
00:58:31.94 --> 00:58:34.26
out of the valley.

1286
00:58:34.26 --> 00:58:38.62
Predon always brought the first sing song called a prayer followed by per people scaring

1287
00:58:38.62 --> 00:58:39.62
about.

1288
00:58:39.62 --> 00:58:42.42
And this is just, you knew right then, right?

1289
00:58:42.42 --> 00:58:43.98
Oh, 100% on it's on.

1290
00:58:43.98 --> 00:58:45.98
No, 110% on it.

1291
00:58:45.98 --> 00:58:46.98
Yeah.

1292
00:58:46.98 --> 00:58:50.82
So this, you know, just for anyone that's listening, that our isn't putting two and two

1293
00:58:50.82 --> 00:58:55.02
together here, there's a village with a bunch of civilians in it and the civilians all

1294
00:58:55.02 --> 00:58:57.22
leave and they take their animals with them.

1295
00:58:57.22 --> 00:59:01.66
They take all their, they take everything that's worth anything with them.

1296
00:59:01.66 --> 00:59:06.42
So they know that there's, it's on.

1297
00:59:06.42 --> 00:59:10.22
Going back to the book as Lieutenant Johnson approached the first row of houses, he radio

1298
00:59:10.22 --> 00:59:16.26
back to Gaza that he and Lieutenant Rulau were heading toward the house of an e-mom.

1299
00:59:16.26 --> 00:59:18.10
One of the village elders.

1300
00:59:18.10 --> 00:59:22.14
Seconds later in RPG streaked in from the east followed by a burst of PKM, a Russian

1301
00:59:22.14 --> 00:59:25.78
made machine gun that shoots a hefty 7.62 millimeter cartridge.

1302
00:59:25.78 --> 00:59:29.94
It started tearing up the ground in the Adobe walls as the men took cover among the

1303
00:59:29.94 --> 00:59:35.86
terrorist walls, more PKM fire came in from the northeast, joined by AKs at a closer range.

1304
00:59:35.86 --> 00:59:39.98
Enemy fighters were crouched inside the houses and below the windows of the school house

1305
00:59:39.98 --> 00:59:40.98
on the southern ridge.

1306
00:59:40.98 --> 00:59:44.58
They were hiding in the alleyways and dug in behind the stone terrorist walls to the

1307
00:59:44.58 --> 00:59:45.58
east.

1308
00:59:45.58 --> 00:59:51.90
It does in fixed positions and we're shooting downhill with the sun behind them.

1309
00:59:51.90 --> 00:59:54.58
Do you have any note there doing?

1310
00:59:54.58 --> 00:59:59.34
Yeah, this is again.

1311
00:59:59.34 --> 01:00:04.54
Do anybody with any kind of military knowledge whatsoever when you read that paragraph

1312
01:00:04.54 --> 01:00:06.34
or that, that does two paragraphs right there.

1313
01:00:06.34 --> 01:00:13.74
You see that you are in a horrible, horrible scenario, multiple enemy machine gun positions

1314
01:00:13.74 --> 01:00:18.74
in elevated coordinated attack.

1315
01:00:18.74 --> 01:00:22.98
Yeah, horrible.

1316
01:00:22.98 --> 01:00:24.50
And here's your thoughts back to the book.

1317
01:00:24.50 --> 01:00:29.18
I waited for the firing to die down, but it didn't.

1318
01:00:29.18 --> 01:00:34.14
The chaos of the RPG explosions, PKM machine guns, AKs and M16s increased.

1319
01:00:34.14 --> 01:00:38.62
I heard the report of a recoilless rifle, basically a hundred pound shoulder or tripod

1320
01:00:38.62 --> 01:00:43.50
mounted cannon, a sure sign of a planned ambush as the douchemen don't lug that over

1321
01:00:43.50 --> 01:00:45.98
the hills for an exercise.

1322
01:00:45.98 --> 01:00:48.66
Then I heard the crump crump of their mortar shells.

1323
01:00:48.66 --> 01:00:52.98
There was a wide babble of voices on the command radio, advisors yelling at each other

1324
01:00:52.98 --> 01:00:53.98
to clear the net.

1325
01:00:53.98 --> 01:00:54.98
No one was taking charge.

1326
01:00:54.98 --> 01:00:56.34
There was no central command.

1327
01:00:56.34 --> 01:01:03.46
I was pacing around frustrated, being out of the fight and not being able to help.

1328
01:01:03.46 --> 01:01:08.22
So you'd seen enough of little fire fights that would be able to burst the fire and then

1329
01:01:08.22 --> 01:01:09.22
people are going to run the fire.

1330
01:01:09.22 --> 01:01:12.18
Yeah, I mean, like they're going to just, they blow their load like right in the beginning

1331
01:01:12.18 --> 01:01:14.06
and then they don't have enough.

1332
01:01:14.06 --> 01:01:16.94
They're not able to like us, resupply.

1333
01:01:16.94 --> 01:01:20.26
They don't sustain anything.

1334
01:01:20.26 --> 01:01:22.18
This was endless.

1335
01:01:22.18 --> 01:01:25.98
And then you mentioned this earlier and again, just to kind of point out to people so they

1336
01:01:25.98 --> 01:01:28.30
understand what you were talking about.

1337
01:01:28.30 --> 01:01:31.82
You said, hey, there's going to be 14 different maneuver elements.

1338
01:01:31.82 --> 01:01:35.50
12 different maneuver elements and they're all on the same net.

1339
01:01:35.50 --> 01:01:39.22
And what that means is they're all in the same radio frequency.

1340
01:01:39.22 --> 01:01:44.30
So picture this, you're trying to have a conversation on the phone, but so are 12 other

1341
01:01:44.30 --> 01:01:48.06
people, 11 other people, all trying to have a conversation on the phone at the same time.

1342
01:01:48.06 --> 01:01:53.46
Yeah, with their nerves, with their nerves, while their rock chaos is happening.

1343
01:01:53.46 --> 01:01:54.46
Yeah.

1344
01:01:54.46 --> 01:02:00.42
And so this is what you end up doing is actually on a phone, you have a better chance

1345
01:02:00.42 --> 01:02:03.86
because a phone will kind of let some of that traffic through.

1346
01:02:03.86 --> 01:02:07.54
But when you start stepping on each other on the radio, they just cut each other off

1347
01:02:07.54 --> 01:02:09.90
and you can't hear anything.

1348
01:02:09.90 --> 01:02:11.26
That's exactly what happened.

1349
01:02:11.26 --> 01:02:13.70
And the other piece of it was it's not just that.

1350
01:02:13.70 --> 01:02:18.86
It was all that one frequency, everything had to be relayed through those snipers to get

1351
01:02:18.86 --> 01:02:20.78
back in the elevated high ground.

1352
01:02:20.78 --> 01:02:23.70
To get back to, could you, did you have direct comms at the guys in the ground?

1353
01:02:23.70 --> 01:02:25.98
Yes, I did, but I'm saying like to get to the command.

1354
01:02:25.98 --> 01:02:29.34
So if you talk, like, you know, and the big thing I brought up was was, you know, what

1355
01:02:29.34 --> 01:02:33.38
happens if you're calling it a MetaVac and you're calling in a call for fire?

1356
01:02:33.38 --> 01:02:37.38
Yeah, you're trying to, that's like trying to call the fire to

1357
01:02:37.38 --> 01:02:41.02
the apartment and the ambulance and you're trying to call them at the same time.

1358
01:02:41.02 --> 01:02:42.42
Like you've got to, you got to separate them.

1359
01:02:42.42 --> 01:02:43.58
Actually, that's not a good example.

1360
01:02:43.58 --> 01:02:47.74
It's trying to call the ambulance and an active shooter and trying to maneuver all that stuff

1361
01:02:47.74 --> 01:02:48.74
happened at the same time.

1362
01:02:48.74 --> 01:02:49.74
Yeah.

1363
01:02:49.74 --> 01:02:52.90
Back to the book.

1364
01:02:52.90 --> 01:02:58.10
Soon, both ridge lines were sparkling with fire as the ass cars and dooshmen engaged

1365
01:02:58.10 --> 01:03:06.50
each other with rocket-papeled grenades, smoke and shrapnel filled the air.

1366
01:03:06.50 --> 01:03:10.54
Winston, he's on, this is Highlander, sexy yelled over the den.

1367
01:03:10.54 --> 01:03:17.34
Four to four line of troops pinned down at X-ray Delta and heavy enemy fire, request immediate

1368
01:03:17.34 --> 01:03:18.94
suppression.

1369
01:03:18.94 --> 01:03:20.98
Fire, Kilo, Echo will adjust.

1370
01:03:20.98 --> 01:03:22.74
So he's trying to call fire.

1371
01:03:22.74 --> 01:03:28.30
You're back and you and Rod says, what do you think Rod said?

1372
01:03:28.30 --> 01:03:32.90
If the dushmen caught around the rear, I said and closed the back door, they'll catch

1373
01:03:32.90 --> 01:03:34.50
our people in a fire sack.

1374
01:03:34.50 --> 01:03:35.70
This is deep shit.

1375
01:03:35.70 --> 01:03:37.42
They got to get out of there.

1376
01:03:37.42 --> 01:03:40.34
The way to break up an ambush is to hammer it with heavy fire.

1377
01:03:40.34 --> 01:03:43.98
The Humvee gave us armor, mobility, and a heavy gun.

1378
01:03:43.98 --> 01:03:48.18
We would roll in and bring team-monti back to the location of the command group.

1379
01:03:48.18 --> 01:03:51.90
I grabbed the radio and called Fox 3, Lieutenant Fabio.

1380
01:03:51.90 --> 01:03:52.90
No reply.

1381
01:03:52.90 --> 01:03:57.58
I tried Fox 6, Williams, and then Fox 9, first sergeant Garza.

1382
01:03:57.58 --> 01:03:58.58
No one replied.

1383
01:03:58.58 --> 01:04:03.18
I was calling for permission to enter the valley asking for it from anyone who would answer.

1384
01:04:03.18 --> 01:04:07.94
Finally, Fox 7, Valdez, up on the northern ridge, answered on the net.

1385
01:04:07.94 --> 01:04:12.06
Fox 3-3, you request to enter the valley, are denied.

1386
01:04:12.06 --> 01:04:18.46
Fox 9 says, you are to stay at your present location.

1387
01:04:18.46 --> 01:04:20.22
And again, I'm throwing out a bunch of different names here.

1388
01:04:20.22 --> 01:04:23.62
These are all the different leaders that are out there on these different 12 elements.

1389
01:04:23.62 --> 01:04:27.58
And when you read the book for yourself, you can kind of catch and understand exactly what

1390
01:04:27.58 --> 01:04:29.42
was happening there.

1391
01:04:29.42 --> 01:04:35.18
But the basically what was going on was your call and who would have a little answer to

1392
01:04:35.18 --> 01:04:37.94
get permission to drive out the valley and give a hand.

1393
01:04:37.94 --> 01:04:41.22
Yeah, I'll show you a different mission.

1394
01:04:41.22 --> 01:04:45.86
I put down the handset and sat there, listening as the dozen advisors try to talk over

1395
01:04:45.86 --> 01:04:47.34
a single radio channel.

1396
01:04:47.34 --> 01:04:49.06
It was sheer bedlam.

1397
01:04:49.06 --> 01:04:50.22
This is bullshit, Rod.

1398
01:04:50.22 --> 01:04:52.78
I rechecked the ammo belt in the Mark 19.

1399
01:04:52.78 --> 01:04:54.06
Rod sat in the driver seat.

1400
01:04:54.06 --> 01:04:55.22
You ready, Rod?

1401
01:04:55.22 --> 01:04:56.54
Give it a few more minutes, Meyer.

1402
01:04:56.54 --> 01:04:58.14
You'll fry for this, he said.

1403
01:04:58.14 --> 01:04:59.14
He was right.

1404
01:04:59.14 --> 01:05:01.54
I'd get sent home for disobeying a direct order.

1405
01:05:01.54 --> 01:05:03.58
There was no question in my mind about that.

1406
01:05:03.58 --> 01:05:06.90
I was already on thinnest with Garza, Fabio, and Williams.

1407
01:05:06.90 --> 01:05:10.82
So I sat there frustrated, listening to the shooting, flexing my hands on the grips of

1408
01:05:10.82 --> 01:05:12.86
the Mark 19 and breathing hard.

1409
01:05:12.86 --> 01:05:14.66
I tried to calm down.

1410
01:05:14.66 --> 01:05:17.78
Maybe the battle sounded worse on the radio than it really was.

1411
01:05:17.78 --> 01:05:19.54
Son of a bitch.

1412
01:05:19.54 --> 01:05:24.26
Inside the tactical operations center at Joyce, so Joyce is a couple miles away.

1413
01:05:24.26 --> 01:05:30.10
And the tactical operations center is where they're running this, they were the supposed to have

1414
01:05:30.10 --> 01:05:33.70
kind of situational awareness of everything that's happening and they're supposed to be

1415
01:05:33.70 --> 01:05:35.70
able to supply fire support.

1416
01:05:35.70 --> 01:05:39.22
So that's when we're talking about the tactical operations center at Joyce, that's where it is.

1417
01:05:39.22 --> 01:05:43.50
Captain Aaron Harding was the senior officer on duty from midnight to eight in the morning,

1418
01:05:43.50 --> 01:05:44.74
the battle captain.

1419
01:05:44.74 --> 01:05:48.30
He had been in Afghanistan for eight months, but had rarely controlled fires and certainly

1420
01:05:48.30 --> 01:05:51.66
not, and certainly none like this.

1421
01:05:51.66 --> 01:05:58.38
As artillery stood by at Joyce, a few miles away and it, a sawdobod, a few miles away,

1422
01:05:58.38 --> 01:06:03.50
harding asked for more and more information from the men on the long table.

1423
01:06:03.50 --> 01:06:05.06
Who was requesting the fire missions?

1424
01:06:05.06 --> 01:06:08.10
Was it shadow four, highlander five or Fox three?

1425
01:06:08.10 --> 01:06:10.18
What had they heard from Fox six?

1426
01:06:10.18 --> 01:06:11.86
Who was presently in charge?

1427
01:06:11.86 --> 01:06:13.98
The marine advisors or the Afghan army?

1428
01:06:13.98 --> 01:06:16.46
Did the ground commander know where all his troops were?

1429
01:06:16.46 --> 01:06:20.34
Had they double-checked the grids of the KEs?

1430
01:06:20.34 --> 01:06:23.58
The asked question after question.

1431
01:06:23.58 --> 01:06:28.66
At Joyce, 120 millimeters, millimeter mortars were fired for, fired 15 minutes after

1432
01:06:28.66 --> 01:06:29.66
Fabio requested.

1433
01:06:29.66 --> 01:06:33.38
The first shell, though, struck within 50 meters of the enemy position, the next flurry

1434
01:06:33.38 --> 01:06:36.14
of shells was on target.

1435
01:06:36.14 --> 01:06:42.02
That would be the only effective fire mission of the entire day.

1436
01:06:42.02 --> 01:06:46.02
This is one of the things that you're going to get more into.

1437
01:06:46.02 --> 01:06:51.78
We actually recently talked about the battle in the hydrangea valley and those guys would

1438
01:06:51.78 --> 01:06:56.26
absolutely 100% have been overrun and what saved their ass over and over again was artillery

1439
01:06:56.26 --> 01:06:57.98
and fire support.

1440
01:06:57.98 --> 01:07:02.22
That's the biggest advantage that we have on the battlefield as Americans.

1441
01:07:02.22 --> 01:07:03.22
100%.

1442
01:07:03.22 --> 01:07:07.66
And your team is calling for the advisors are calling for it.

1443
01:07:07.66 --> 01:07:08.66
They're not given it.

1444
01:07:08.66 --> 01:07:09.66
They're not given it.

1445
01:07:09.66 --> 01:07:11.66
I mean, they shut it down.

1446
01:07:11.66 --> 01:07:17.14
And to try to give the benefit of the doubt here of why they shut it down, I totally understand

1447
01:07:17.14 --> 01:07:18.14
it.

1448
01:07:18.14 --> 01:07:20.30
But it goes back to the one thing I said, right?

1449
01:07:20.30 --> 01:07:23.10
I mean, they couldn't probably couldn't figure out who the hell was calling what and

1450
01:07:23.10 --> 01:07:24.10
where what was where.

1451
01:07:24.10 --> 01:07:28.18
I mean, I don't know that I could have confidently fired around.

1452
01:07:28.18 --> 01:07:33.58
But part of it was because of the layout of everybody on one frequency.

1453
01:07:33.58 --> 01:07:36.10
You know, it goes back to the initial problem.

1454
01:07:36.10 --> 01:07:37.70
Like, I don't know if I could have fired around.

1455
01:07:37.70 --> 01:07:41.46
Now, in my piss that they didn't fire around, that's literally like it was wrong.

1456
01:07:41.46 --> 01:07:43.86
It was wrong for the reasons they did it.

1457
01:07:43.86 --> 01:07:52.02
But the confusion was so chaotic in the beginning, especially.

1458
01:07:52.02 --> 01:07:58.98
But I can tell you this, that if they had got the round, it had broke the enemy.

1459
01:07:58.98 --> 01:08:04.90
And again, to advance your point of giving the benefit of the doubt, if they have no

1460
01:08:04.90 --> 01:08:08.50
idea where families are, they could have fired rounds on friendly forces as well.

1461
01:08:08.50 --> 01:08:09.50
Well, exactly.

1462
01:08:09.50 --> 01:08:11.42
And then, you know, they'd have been accountable for that.

1463
01:08:11.42 --> 01:08:18.38
And I'll tell you that's, that's a hard decision to make to possibly, you know,

1464
01:08:18.38 --> 01:08:21.46
fratur side blue on blues is in my opinion.

1465
01:08:21.46 --> 01:08:24.34
That's going to look like a worse thing that can happen in war.

1466
01:08:24.34 --> 01:08:31.42
And so what these guys are being asked to possibly do is risk a fratur side, which in

1467
01:08:31.42 --> 01:08:38.02
their minds and most probably a lot of military minds, I think mine included.

1468
01:08:38.02 --> 01:08:41.18
Well, it's hard to say, what's better?

1469
01:08:41.18 --> 01:08:45.34
You know, risk fratur side or risk getting overrun.

1470
01:08:45.34 --> 01:08:48.74
Now, if we know for a fact, people are getting overrun, then you're like, okay, we'll

1471
01:08:48.74 --> 01:08:49.86
risk fratur side.

1472
01:08:49.86 --> 01:08:50.86
And that's why that happened.

1473
01:08:50.86 --> 01:08:54.22
Sometimes, for people, so I drop that bomb no matter what.

1474
01:08:54.22 --> 01:08:58.22
But to say, I'm not 100% sure people are going to go overrun, but I'm still going to take

1475
01:08:58.22 --> 01:09:00.38
the risk of fratur side at this point.

1476
01:09:00.38 --> 01:09:01.82
That's probably why they're holding off.

1477
01:09:01.82 --> 01:09:03.10
It is in the beginning.

1478
01:09:03.10 --> 01:09:04.10
Yeah.

1479
01:09:04.10 --> 01:09:07.66
And they get to a point where they call the danger close rounds and try and take responsibility

1480
01:09:07.66 --> 01:09:10.78
and we'll get there.

1481
01:09:10.78 --> 01:09:15.54
To book the enemy above, the enemy above worked their way around the edges of Valley shooting

1482
01:09:15.54 --> 01:09:20.30
downhill, the Taliban machine gunners tracked in on one asker than another than another.

1483
01:09:20.30 --> 01:09:22.58
It was a killing ground.

1484
01:09:22.58 --> 01:09:23.58
They're all over the place.

1485
01:09:23.58 --> 01:09:28.18
Swenson was thinking to himself, I may not make it out of here.

1486
01:09:28.18 --> 01:09:32.14
If you hunker down and don't shoot back, you will surely die.

1487
01:09:32.14 --> 01:09:36.90
The other side gains confidence and rushes forward in the frenzy of combat soldiers act

1488
01:09:36.90 --> 01:09:37.90
like sharks.

1489
01:09:37.90 --> 01:09:40.54
They sense weakness and circle in.

1490
01:09:40.54 --> 01:09:46.18
Thinking off the wounded and the defenseless slowly, the douchemen were closing in from both

1491
01:09:46.18 --> 01:09:48.38
sides of the wash.

1492
01:09:48.38 --> 01:09:49.38
So they were ready.

1493
01:09:49.38 --> 01:09:50.90
Oh, let me tell you something.

1494
01:09:50.90 --> 01:09:53.18
They were good.

1495
01:09:53.18 --> 01:09:54.18
They were good.

1496
01:09:54.18 --> 01:09:55.18
They were trained.

1497
01:09:55.18 --> 01:09:56.18
Bad gear.

1498
01:09:56.18 --> 01:09:58.78
You know, they had play carriers.

1499
01:09:58.78 --> 01:10:02.58
They were taking the uniforms off our dead guys.

1500
01:10:02.58 --> 01:10:04.06
They put Kevlar's on.

1501
01:10:04.06 --> 01:10:08.90
They're good.

1502
01:10:08.90 --> 01:10:10.46
They'll try to get fire support here.

1503
01:10:10.46 --> 01:10:13.34
Swenson identified enemy positions at four grid positions.

1504
01:10:13.34 --> 01:10:15.22
There are two basic ways of calling in artillery.

1505
01:10:15.22 --> 01:10:21.22
You can give the grid coordinates of the target or the kilo echo number for a grid in a

1506
01:10:21.22 --> 01:10:26.06
just after the initial round or you can give your own location and a compass bearing to

1507
01:10:26.06 --> 01:10:27.22
the end instant to the target.

1508
01:10:27.22 --> 01:10:31.62
The second technique is called a polar mission provides the guns with the locations of both

1509
01:10:31.62 --> 01:10:34.34
the friendly observer and the target.

1510
01:10:34.34 --> 01:10:38.02
Tell the talk all-sended polar swenson radio to Kaplan.

1511
01:10:38.02 --> 01:10:39.02
That's on me.

1512
01:10:39.02 --> 01:10:40.22
Give them my initials.

1513
01:10:40.22 --> 01:10:42.98
I'm making the decision not them.

1514
01:10:42.98 --> 01:10:46.50
Assuming accurate fire, the US mortars will less than two miles away.

1515
01:10:46.50 --> 01:10:49.78
The only target endangered by the polar plot was the enemy.

1516
01:10:49.78 --> 01:10:53.02
By sending his initials, Swenson was taking full responsibility.

1517
01:10:53.02 --> 01:10:57.02
If anything went wrong, if a friendly soldier or civilian were hit, the burden rested

1518
01:10:57.02 --> 01:11:00.90
squarely on Swenson not with the talk in the rear.

1519
01:11:00.90 --> 01:11:05.26
The talk responded to the polar request by asking again for information that was impossible

1520
01:11:05.26 --> 01:11:06.26
to provide.

1521
01:11:06.26 --> 01:11:08.06
There were all the friendly troops.

1522
01:11:08.06 --> 01:11:10.54
What was the forward line of trace of the friendly units?

1523
01:11:10.54 --> 01:11:11.94
Was everyone accounted for?

1524
01:11:11.94 --> 01:11:16.18
Were any civilians endangered?

1525
01:11:16.18 --> 01:11:21.14
Kaplan told Shadow, the relay team above the him, tell the talk that it's critical.

1526
01:11:21.14 --> 01:11:22.42
I repeat critical.

1527
01:11:22.42 --> 01:11:25.06
We have advisors pinned down.

1528
01:11:25.06 --> 01:11:27.22
The talk denied Shadow's fire mission.

1529
01:11:27.22 --> 01:11:30.94
Furious sergeant summers at Shadow 4 pressed back against the talk.

1530
01:11:30.94 --> 01:11:34.82
The main element is being hit from the north, east, and south.

1531
01:11:34.82 --> 01:11:36.06
All elements are engaged.

1532
01:11:36.06 --> 01:11:38.14
I repeat, all elements are heavily engaged.

1533
01:11:38.14 --> 01:11:41.78
We need fire missions now.

1534
01:11:41.78 --> 01:11:44.86
The NCOs inside the talk were doing their job.

1535
01:11:44.86 --> 01:11:49.06
And the artillery and mortar crews wanted to oblige, yet it seemed to sergeant summers

1536
01:11:49.06 --> 01:11:53.82
that every time he relayed a fire mission, the talk asked him 20 questions.

1537
01:11:53.82 --> 01:11:58.26
The second string was running the show here and not well.

1538
01:11:58.26 --> 01:12:03.38
In fire fights, it's not unusual for 200 to 2000 artillery shells to be fired over

1539
01:12:03.38 --> 01:12:06.82
the course of the first hour of the battle at Gonjagal.

1540
01:12:06.82 --> 01:12:17.50
When men lay trapped in dying, the talk at Joyce allowed only 21 artillery shells to be fired.

1541
01:12:17.50 --> 01:12:23.30
Since World War II forwarded servers, had received artillery fire under the rule of silence

1542
01:12:23.30 --> 01:12:25.38
is consent.

1543
01:12:25.38 --> 01:12:29.98
When an observer called for fire, the mission went by radio to the Operation Center and to

1544
01:12:29.98 --> 01:12:30.98
the guns.

1545
01:12:30.98 --> 01:12:36.02
The violence by the Ops Center constituted consent for the guns to fire.

1546
01:12:36.02 --> 01:12:40.86
In the 21st century, with computers making instant firing calculations, within two minutes

1547
01:12:40.86 --> 01:12:44.10
shells could be hitting the target.

1548
01:12:44.10 --> 01:12:49.78
But beginning about 2006, sergeants and loutonets on the front lines were trusted less.

1549
01:12:49.78 --> 01:12:54.18
The high command believed the grunts were too quick to call and fires that endangered civilians

1550
01:12:54.18 --> 01:12:58.54
resulting in an embedded population that supported the insurgency.

1551
01:12:58.54 --> 01:13:02.38
The solution was to apply a strict new rule.

1552
01:13:02.38 --> 01:13:07.26
Two months before Gonjagal, General Stanley Macristol, the senior commander in Afghanistan

1553
01:13:07.26 --> 01:13:12.74
issued a directive that forbade the use of artillery against or near any structure likely

1554
01:13:12.74 --> 01:13:20.46
to contain civilians unless the higher the next higher headquarters commander had approved.

1555
01:13:20.46 --> 01:13:23.38
That ended silence is consent.

1556
01:13:23.38 --> 01:13:29.66
The high command had shifted decision making from the battlefield to the staff.

1557
01:13:29.66 --> 01:13:33.46
Swenson was not trusted to make the hard decisions.

1558
01:13:33.46 --> 01:13:38.90
Instead, officers in the talk with a confused idea of the battlefield had to decide whether

1559
01:13:38.90 --> 01:13:42.50
to honor his requests for fire.

1560
01:13:42.50 --> 01:13:45.94
Yeah, I know that's where my problem comes in, right?

1561
01:13:45.94 --> 01:13:51.02
If the doctor is, I give my initials, I take their responsibility.

1562
01:13:51.02 --> 01:13:54.54
But then follow the doctrine.

1563
01:13:54.54 --> 01:13:57.14
That's where they went wrong.

1564
01:13:57.14 --> 01:14:01.90
And I'll tell you something else that you talked about how confusing it was over the net.

1565
01:14:01.90 --> 01:14:04.74
Clearly it was obviously very confusing.

1566
01:14:04.74 --> 01:14:12.94
How long would it take to verbally explain the layout of this whole situation?

1567
01:14:12.94 --> 01:14:14.46
It would take a very long time.

1568
01:14:14.46 --> 01:14:18.66
It would take an extremely eloquent person who had the time to kind of compose himself

1569
01:14:18.66 --> 01:14:20.82
and sit there and try and explain it.

1570
01:14:20.82 --> 01:14:23.58
That's why you make Keylo Echoes.

1571
01:14:23.58 --> 01:14:27.54
That's why you have these pre-plan fire positions so that you don't have to think anymore.

1572
01:14:27.54 --> 01:14:29.14
We can direct fires.

1573
01:14:29.14 --> 01:14:32.94
And instead of having to communicate what the situation on the ground is, what you communicate

1574
01:14:32.94 --> 01:14:34.74
is this is what we need.

1575
01:14:34.74 --> 01:14:36.74
And this is where you need to put it.

1576
01:14:36.74 --> 01:14:38.42
I mean, that's 100%.

1577
01:14:38.42 --> 01:14:42.82
I mean, that's 100% it.

1578
01:14:42.82 --> 01:14:47.50
You could never, first off, you could never relay all the information there.

1579
01:14:47.50 --> 01:14:51.58
And guess what, in the end of the day, it was irrelevant to what they were needing to do.

1580
01:14:51.58 --> 01:14:55.62
And also by the time you, if you could relay it by the time you relay it, it would be different.

1581
01:14:55.62 --> 01:14:58.30
Because what are you going to tell everyone to sit still for a minute while I explain where you are?

1582
01:14:58.30 --> 01:14:59.46
That doesn't work.

1583
01:14:59.46 --> 01:15:04.10
That's why decentralized command is so important on the battlefield.

1584
01:15:04.10 --> 01:15:07.70
This is the exact reason why decentralized command is so important on the battlefield.

1585
01:15:07.70 --> 01:15:12.22
When you centralized command, people that actually are there that need to be able to make decisions

1586
01:15:12.22 --> 01:15:13.22
make things happen.

1587
01:15:13.22 --> 01:15:15.22
Can't do it.

1588
01:15:15.22 --> 01:15:19.66
And by the way, how do you overcome a situation like this?

1589
01:15:19.66 --> 01:15:24.74
How do you overcome a situation where, okay, you're my subordinate.

1590
01:15:24.74 --> 01:15:26.70
You work for me.

1591
01:15:26.70 --> 01:15:30.62
And I don't, I don't want you to be able to have the ability to fire because I'm afraid

1592
01:15:30.62 --> 01:15:31.62
you can hurt civilians.

1593
01:15:31.62 --> 01:15:32.62
How do I solve that?

1594
01:15:32.62 --> 01:15:35.58
The way to solve it is not to say no, I don't care that you're that authority.

1595
01:15:35.58 --> 01:15:40.38
The way I solve it is to say, okay, Dakota, let me explain some things to you.

1596
01:15:40.38 --> 01:15:42.14
We need to protect the civilian populace.

1597
01:15:42.14 --> 01:15:45.34
We need to make sure we don't damage any infrastructure to the best of our ability.

1598
01:15:45.34 --> 01:15:47.86
I want you to understand how strategically important that is.

1599
01:15:47.86 --> 01:15:48.86
Do you understand?

1600
01:15:48.86 --> 01:15:50.38
Let me put you through some scenarios.

1601
01:15:50.38 --> 01:15:51.38
What if you were here in this happened?

1602
01:15:51.38 --> 01:15:52.38
What would you do?

1603
01:15:52.38 --> 01:15:53.38
What if you were here in this happened?

1604
01:15:53.38 --> 01:15:54.38
What would you do?

1605
01:15:54.38 --> 01:15:58.50
I train you and I build trust so that I can decentralize the command.

1606
01:15:58.50 --> 01:15:59.82
That's how you overcome it.

1607
01:15:59.82 --> 01:16:01.14
You don't overcome it.

1608
01:16:01.14 --> 01:16:03.94
It's a shortcut to try and centralize and it ends up getting people killed.

1609
01:16:03.94 --> 01:16:19.02
All right, go back to the book, Fox 3-1, Lieutenant Johnson finally came up on the radio.

1610
01:16:19.02 --> 01:16:23.50
We're pinned down in a house, receiving accurate fire from the next house.

1611
01:16:23.50 --> 01:16:25.62
We have to get out of here.

1612
01:16:25.62 --> 01:16:29.98
He was caught off by others, pushing to use the same frequency, three or four advisors

1613
01:16:29.98 --> 01:16:31.94
were trying to talk, stepping on each other.

1614
01:16:31.94 --> 01:16:35.46
I could hear the strain and the voices, the lack of crisp borders, the front to yelling

1615
01:16:35.46 --> 01:16:38.18
of men who are pinned down.

1616
01:16:38.18 --> 01:16:43.58
After a few minutes, Fox 3-2, Staff Sergeant can't have tried to pass his location on the

1617
01:16:43.58 --> 01:16:45.30
grid to Fabio.

1618
01:16:45.30 --> 01:16:48.62
I can't shoot back there and said because I'm pinned down, they're shooting at me from the

1619
01:16:48.62 --> 01:16:49.62
house.

1620
01:16:49.62 --> 01:16:50.62
It's so close.

1621
01:16:50.62 --> 01:16:53.06
Grid.

1622
01:16:53.06 --> 01:16:56.22
Three-2, this is three-three radio, Staff Sergeant can't have picked.

1623
01:16:56.22 --> 01:17:00.30
Repeat your grid, repeat your grid, or you radioed to the benefit.

1624
01:17:00.30 --> 01:17:01.62
Repeat your grid, repeat your grid.

1625
01:17:01.62 --> 01:17:06.02
See, he faded as he was trying to tell you his grid.

1626
01:17:06.02 --> 01:17:09.46
Nothing after that, but static and garbled voices.

1627
01:17:09.46 --> 01:17:11.18
That broke it from me.

1628
01:17:11.18 --> 01:17:16.98
I had promised my team I would be there, as far as I was concerned, my command element

1629
01:17:16.98 --> 01:17:26.74
wasn't in command.

1630
01:17:26.74 --> 01:17:31.30
Twice I had heard Shadow say that air would be on station in 15 minutes.

1631
01:17:31.30 --> 01:17:32.66
Nothing happened.

1632
01:17:32.66 --> 01:17:36.06
How long do you do nothing while your friends are fighting for their lives?

1633
01:17:36.06 --> 01:17:40.30
Fox 7, this is three-three, sitting here is stupid, we're going in.

1634
01:17:40.30 --> 01:17:42.18
Rod and I were on the net with Valdez.

1635
01:17:42.18 --> 01:17:43.74
There was no dispute among us.

1636
01:17:43.74 --> 01:17:46.98
It was about 0-600 time to move.

1637
01:17:46.98 --> 01:17:50.98
I was the vehicle commander, so the fault lay with me for disobeying orders if I arrived

1638
01:17:50.98 --> 01:17:54.98
in the valley and discovered that the command group had the situation under control.

1639
01:17:54.98 --> 01:17:59.46
I knew there was a good chance I'd be sent back to the states and disgrace.

1640
01:17:59.46 --> 01:18:02.90
When I shouted the askers to follow us, they looked confused.

1641
01:18:02.90 --> 01:18:06.50
Up on the north outpost, Valdez grabbed a senior Afghan sergeant.

1642
01:18:06.50 --> 01:18:10.50
The sergeant radio to the Afghan drivers clustered around our truck urging them and passed

1643
01:18:10.50 --> 01:18:12.90
to to follow me.

1644
01:18:12.90 --> 01:18:15.90
Mortar shells were falling a football field away to our west.

1645
01:18:15.90 --> 01:18:19.38
The enemy knew our trucks were somewhere on the path, but on certain just where.

1646
01:18:19.38 --> 01:18:22.34
The explosions made the askers jumpy.

1647
01:18:22.34 --> 01:18:26.22
Just the same, some of them jumped into two homies and roared into position behind us.

1648
01:18:26.22 --> 01:18:27.70
Rod, let's go.

1649
01:18:27.70 --> 01:18:35.14
I said he put it in gear.

1650
01:18:35.14 --> 01:18:41.26
Now by that time you start actually going into the valley and as you're going in, by that

1651
01:18:41.26 --> 01:18:45.62
time several askers were stumbling out of the battlefield, some bleeding a few without their

1652
01:18:45.62 --> 01:18:47.58
rifles all exhausted.

1653
01:18:47.58 --> 01:18:50.18
Where Americana, y'all, dust, dust.

1654
01:18:50.18 --> 01:18:52.82
The asker's pointed up toward the village.

1655
01:18:52.82 --> 01:18:56.22
So as you're driving in, you're seeing guys fleeing the battlefield.

1656
01:18:56.22 --> 01:18:59.30
I mean, it was terrible.

1657
01:18:59.30 --> 01:19:03.42
Like as we go in, you're just seeing these guys come out and it's in Ramadan so they

1658
01:19:03.42 --> 01:19:04.42
won't either.

1659
01:19:04.42 --> 01:19:07.62
They won't drink any water and they're coming out of this battle and they're just like,

1660
01:19:07.62 --> 01:19:10.70
you're not even close to the valley yet and they're coming out of this battle.

1661
01:19:10.70 --> 01:19:12.30
They don't have any weapons on them.

1662
01:19:12.30 --> 01:19:16.66
They're just broken, they're bloodied, they're, they're been shot.

1663
01:19:16.66 --> 01:19:22.70
They've just, I mean, you're carrying each other and you're just like, what are we going

1664
01:19:22.70 --> 01:19:23.70
into?

1665
01:19:23.70 --> 01:19:29.78
Somewhere behind us was a US Army Paltoon.

1666
01:19:29.78 --> 01:19:33.06
It seemed to me to be a time for them to make a move.

1667
01:19:33.06 --> 01:19:36.58
They were the quick reaction force, our insurance policy.

1668
01:19:36.58 --> 01:19:41.34
Valdez was on the radio arguing with dog 36, the quick reaction Army Paltoon commander,

1669
01:19:41.34 --> 01:19:44.74
dog 36 is Fox 7, Valdez radio.

1670
01:19:44.74 --> 01:19:45.74
Radioed.

1671
01:19:45.74 --> 01:19:46.74
You need to get in there, man.

1672
01:19:46.74 --> 01:19:50.74
Fox 3, 3 is 2, you're front and a home V. Drive East until you link up with them.

1673
01:19:50.74 --> 01:19:56.02
Fox 7, this is dog 36, the Lieutenant, our vehicles are too big for the mission.

1674
01:19:56.02 --> 01:20:00.02
We were driving on a footpath that was barely wide enough for our home V. Valdez came up

1675
01:20:00.02 --> 01:20:01.58
with an alternative dog 36.

1676
01:20:01.58 --> 01:20:02.98
This is Fox 7.

1677
01:20:02.98 --> 01:20:06.70
I understand, drive forward until you reach the Afghan vehicles, use them to get into the

1678
01:20:06.70 --> 01:20:07.70
fight.

1679
01:20:07.70 --> 01:20:09.34
There are people out there dying.

1680
01:20:09.34 --> 01:20:13.78
The Paltoon leader said he had to wait for clearance from the talk at Joyce.

1681
01:20:13.78 --> 01:20:16.18
Yeah.

1682
01:20:16.18 --> 01:20:18.18
What kind of vehicles did the QRF have?

1683
01:20:18.18 --> 01:20:19.18
They were in MAPs.

1684
01:20:19.18 --> 01:20:21.18
Okay.

1685
01:20:21.18 --> 01:20:27.10
God, I mean, how did you excuse?

1686
01:20:27.10 --> 01:20:28.10
Yeah, I was awesome.

1687
01:20:28.10 --> 01:20:30.46
Would it be to have an M-Rop role into this situation?

1688
01:20:30.46 --> 01:20:33.10
Yeah, I don't think they could have the road wouldn't have to.

1689
01:20:33.10 --> 01:20:34.10
Too small.

1690
01:20:34.10 --> 01:20:35.54
Yeah, because they ended up coming in in one of those.

1691
01:20:35.54 --> 01:20:37.94
It looks like a tank, but it's on wheels.

1692
01:20:37.94 --> 01:20:42.54
And it ended up flipping over off the bank.

1693
01:20:42.54 --> 01:20:44.74
But they, like at the end of the day, we had Tuna Humbies.

1694
01:20:44.74 --> 01:20:49.30
I mean, we just brought in 90 people sitting right there, they could have jumped in,

1695
01:20:49.30 --> 01:20:54.66
huh, me, isn't it?

1696
01:20:54.66 --> 01:21:00.66
The helicopter ops center called back, saying the retasking of the birds had been canceled

1697
01:21:00.66 --> 01:21:05.94
because Lance had not called his own brigade headquarters to ask permission and because

1698
01:21:05.94 --> 01:21:09.06
another mission, North of Gondra Gaul was of higher priority.

1699
01:21:09.06 --> 01:21:12.94
So one of the guys in the, in the ops center had actually said, you know what, screw

1700
01:21:12.94 --> 01:21:17.78
it, I'm calling for he, and he hadn't called the brigade and run through the proper

1701
01:21:17.78 --> 01:21:20.26
chain of command and they shut him down.

1702
01:21:20.26 --> 01:21:21.26
Yeah.

1703
01:21:21.26 --> 01:21:28.58
So here we go, more than an hour into the fight, the situation was as follows.

1704
01:21:28.58 --> 01:21:33.66
Team Monti was trapped in a house in the US and Afghan commanders were pinned down by shooters

1705
01:21:33.66 --> 01:21:37.38
closing in on them from three sides.

1706
01:21:37.38 --> 01:21:40.70
The north and south observation posts were under fire.

1707
01:21:40.70 --> 01:21:43.98
The ass cars were caught in the open with nowhere to hide.

1708
01:21:43.98 --> 01:21:46.10
Rod and I hadn't reached the wash.

1709
01:21:46.10 --> 01:21:49.82
The one three two quick reaction between was not quick reacting.

1710
01:21:49.82 --> 01:21:56.02
The talk at Joyce was paralyzed, preventing artillery support and the helicopter gunships

1711
01:21:56.02 --> 01:21:57.62
had not arrived.

1712
01:21:57.62 --> 01:22:03.26
Is the perfect storm?

1713
01:22:03.26 --> 01:22:16.22
Damn, that's just, there's absolutely nothing else to go wrong right now.

1714
01:22:16.22 --> 01:22:17.38
It's the perfect storm.

1715
01:22:17.38 --> 01:22:24.78
It is the absolute perfect storm.

1716
01:22:24.78 --> 01:22:30.42
Swenson wanted a massive artillery barrage because the douchemen didn't have overhead

1717
01:22:30.42 --> 01:22:35.34
to cover artillery airbrush would send millions of lancets raining down toward them.

1718
01:22:35.34 --> 01:22:39.06
Hundreds of shells had to shake the mountains and roll thunder down the valley.

1719
01:22:39.06 --> 01:22:41.70
The douchemen were zealots but they weren't crazy.

1720
01:22:41.70 --> 01:22:46.34
Once artillery began exploding overhead, gunmoth, AKs wouldn't get up and run forward in

1721
01:22:46.34 --> 01:22:49.78
the open.

1722
01:22:49.78 --> 01:22:54.42
Yet the talk refused to fire at Gangegol on the a few miles from camp Joyce.

1723
01:22:54.42 --> 01:22:58.86
Unleasing a barrage in your own backyard wouldn't win any applause at higher headquarters.

1724
01:22:58.86 --> 01:23:03.88
The directive from the high command was so clear, do not employ air to ground or indirect

1725
01:23:03.88 --> 01:23:08.48
fires against residential compounds to find as any structure or building known or likely

1726
01:23:08.48 --> 01:23:10.26
to contain civilians.

1727
01:23:10.26 --> 01:23:23.86
Unless the ground force commander has verified that no civilians are present.

1728
01:23:23.86 --> 01:23:32.50
And that rule right there is written so impossible.

1729
01:23:32.50 --> 01:23:33.50
What do you do?

1730
01:23:33.50 --> 01:23:34.90
The village you get shot at.

1731
01:23:34.90 --> 01:23:37.22
So you run through their use of the military.

1732
01:23:37.22 --> 01:23:40.22
You should.

1733
01:23:40.22 --> 01:23:47.30
You know, I have to look to like a full review of the artillery or this specific directive

1734
01:23:47.30 --> 01:23:50.54
but normally the self defense thing trumps everything.

1735
01:23:50.54 --> 01:23:54.50
But usually that's what I always say, right? I always talk about artillery and you know,

1736
01:23:54.50 --> 01:23:56.90
artillery is a say blah blah blah blah.

1737
01:23:56.90 --> 01:23:59.18
But then at the end of it, it always ends.

1738
01:23:59.18 --> 01:24:05.42
It says or hostile act hostile intent.

1739
01:24:05.42 --> 01:24:06.86
But it's all by interpretation.

1740
01:24:06.86 --> 01:24:08.66
I mean that it goes back to the commanders.

1741
01:24:08.66 --> 01:24:16.18
I mean, you know, I don't blame the artillery that Stanley McCristal put in place for what

1742
01:24:16.18 --> 01:24:17.50
happened that day.

1743
01:24:17.50 --> 01:24:25.42
I blame the people, the leadership who was incompetent to make a decision.

1744
01:24:25.42 --> 01:24:27.30
You know what I mean?

1745
01:24:27.30 --> 01:24:32.06
It's like nobody wants to just own it and take accountability and take responsibility.

1746
01:24:32.06 --> 01:24:33.06
And say, you know what?

1747
01:24:33.06 --> 01:24:35.62
I'm doing this because it's the right thing to do.

1748
01:24:35.62 --> 01:24:39.66
They want to be able to say, well, I didn't do it because, well, this is the order.

1749
01:24:39.66 --> 01:24:40.66
Come on.

1750
01:24:40.66 --> 01:24:41.66
Come on.

1751
01:24:41.66 --> 01:24:46.74
You know, if you're in a leadership position, take responsibility.

1752
01:24:46.74 --> 01:24:47.74
Yeah.

1753
01:24:47.74 --> 01:24:53.18
You got to do the right thing.

1754
01:24:53.18 --> 01:24:56.42
This is bottom line and that's what makes leadership hard.

1755
01:24:56.42 --> 01:24:58.98
And sometimes the right thing is the break rules.

1756
01:24:58.98 --> 01:25:01.30
Sometimes the right thing is to not follow orders.

1757
01:25:01.30 --> 01:25:03.06
Sometimes orders are wrong.

1758
01:25:03.06 --> 01:25:04.98
And you shouldn't follow them.

1759
01:25:04.98 --> 01:25:09.34
And the polling said, if you're in charge and you get tasked with something that's wrong

1760
01:25:09.34 --> 01:25:10.94
and you execute it, you're culpable.

1761
01:25:10.94 --> 01:25:14.94
Doesn't matter if you get ordered or not.

1762
01:25:14.94 --> 01:25:18.86
Sometimes you break the rules going right back to the Yesman thing.

1763
01:25:18.86 --> 01:25:25.58
And I guarantee the intent of staying a crystal, putting this RRE in place wasn't to deny

1764
01:25:25.58 --> 01:25:28.66
guys that were pinned down my enemy fire.

1765
01:25:28.66 --> 01:25:32.86
But again, how are we communicating it?

1766
01:25:32.86 --> 01:25:38.38
And we put in the priorities in place correctly so that everybody knows.

1767
01:25:38.38 --> 01:25:44.02
Yeah, I mean, you know, when it's put out in an email, it's kind of like it's as dangerous

1768
01:25:44.02 --> 01:25:46.02
as you interpreting me a text.

1769
01:25:46.02 --> 01:25:47.02
Mm-hmm.

1770
01:25:47.02 --> 01:25:50.02
I mean, everybody looks at it different.

1771
01:25:50.02 --> 01:25:51.02
Yep.

1772
01:25:51.02 --> 01:25:57.02
And you know what?

1773
01:25:57.02 --> 01:26:00.02
That's why things like commanders intent are so important.

1774
01:26:00.02 --> 01:26:05.66
So if I know what it is, like if I know what it is that you want done and my job is to get

1775
01:26:05.66 --> 01:26:09.02
it done and you give me parameters to do it within, I'll stay within those parameters

1776
01:26:09.02 --> 01:26:11.14
and I'll get the job done.

1777
01:26:11.14 --> 01:26:14.06
And I'll come back to you and say, hey, boss, I had to bend the rules a little bit here,

1778
01:26:14.06 --> 01:26:15.38
but I got the mission done.

1779
01:26:15.38 --> 01:26:18.98
Or I might call you back and say, hey, I'm getting ready to break the rules to get the

1780
01:26:18.98 --> 01:26:19.98
mission done.

1781
01:26:19.98 --> 01:26:21.98
Do you want me to break them or not?

1782
01:26:21.98 --> 01:26:22.98
Yeah.

1783
01:26:22.98 --> 01:26:28.62
All right.

1784
01:26:28.62 --> 01:26:32.66
Back to the book, Shadow, the Army Outpost on the Southern Ridge replied that the

1785
01:26:32.66 --> 01:26:36.38
talk at Joyce said the fire mission was too close to the village.

1786
01:26:36.38 --> 01:26:40.66
Too close to the village, Lieutenant Johnson said, if you don't give me these rounds right

1787
01:26:40.66 --> 01:26:47.78
now, I'm gonna die.

1788
01:26:47.78 --> 01:26:50.78
Try your best.

1789
01:26:50.78 --> 01:26:55.78
Shadow replied, knowing the talk would not fire.

1790
01:26:55.78 --> 01:26:58.78
Try your best.

1791
01:26:58.78 --> 01:27:03.62
Try your best.

1792
01:27:03.62 --> 01:27:08.82
From the tone of Shadow's voice, I knew he was on the verge of complete rage.

1793
01:27:08.82 --> 01:27:11.58
He wanted to strangle the officers in the talk at Joyce.

1794
01:27:11.58 --> 01:27:12.78
I felt the same way.

1795
01:27:12.78 --> 01:27:14.18
This couldn't be happening.

1796
01:27:14.18 --> 01:27:16.30
We were on the same side.

1797
01:27:16.30 --> 01:27:18.06
We weren't Marines or soldiers.

1798
01:27:18.06 --> 01:27:20.14
We weren't Americans or Oscars.

1799
01:27:20.14 --> 01:27:23.90
We were one lone group fighting desperately to stay alive.

1800
01:27:23.90 --> 01:27:26.70
The villages, villagers, one our friends.

1801
01:27:26.70 --> 01:27:29.98
This was a war and my team was on the verge of dying.

1802
01:27:29.98 --> 01:27:32.82
Who's side was the talk on?

1803
01:27:32.82 --> 01:27:37.34
Radio call after radio call, swints and kept requesting smoke.

1804
01:27:37.34 --> 01:27:43.70
Finally around 0630 the talk at Joyce permitted four white phosphorus rounds to be fired

1805
01:27:43.70 --> 01:27:49.46
into the southeast backside of the village, too far away to conceal my team.

1806
01:27:49.46 --> 01:27:54.38
Those were the last rounds fired during the battle.

1807
01:27:54.38 --> 01:28:00.18
That about 0640 the talk at Joyce forbade any more artillery support, citing garbled

1808
01:28:00.18 --> 01:28:06.34
communications in complete calls for fire procedures and a lack of situational awareness

1809
01:28:06.34 --> 01:28:12.50
on the part of those trapped in the valley.

1810
01:28:12.50 --> 01:28:19.06
So there's the reasons from their perspective.

1811
01:28:19.06 --> 01:28:23.62
Garbled communications in complete calls for fire procedures and a lack of situational

1812
01:28:23.62 --> 01:28:35.14
awareness on the part of those trapped in the valley.

1813
01:28:35.14 --> 01:28:41.30
Meanwhile, during this time you've been moving up, grabbing bodies, coming back.

1814
01:28:41.30 --> 01:28:45.02
And here we go again as we move forward for a third time the talk had finally ordered the

1815
01:28:45.02 --> 01:28:47.18
army platoon, dog three to two to move forward.

1816
01:28:47.18 --> 01:28:51.18
They pulled in behind us with a platoon leader in a home view with an anti tank tow missile

1817
01:28:51.18 --> 01:28:52.18
on the roof.

1818
01:28:52.18 --> 01:28:55.90
The tow made no sense to me, but the truck was equipped with a 240 machine gun.

1819
01:28:55.90 --> 01:28:59.74
Behind them were 20 US soldiers and four hemaliate heavily armored vehicles.

1820
01:28:59.74 --> 01:29:03.70
You rolling with me lieutenant, I was confirming what I took for granted.

1821
01:29:03.70 --> 01:29:06.74
I'll scout the route first before I'd bring my platoon in.

1822
01:29:06.74 --> 01:29:08.98
The terrain may be too tough.

1823
01:29:08.98 --> 01:29:11.38
He refused to put his soldiers into the Afghan vehicles.

1824
01:29:11.38 --> 01:29:12.54
I could understand that.

1825
01:29:12.54 --> 01:29:15.70
OK, I go first, I said, you cover our six.

1826
01:29:15.70 --> 01:29:19.50
The Afghans will be behind you.

1827
01:29:19.50 --> 01:29:23.10
As we bounced forward, I heard team monti again come up on the radio.

1828
01:29:23.10 --> 01:29:26.42
We're under fire lieutenant, Johnson said.

1829
01:29:26.42 --> 01:29:31.78
We're surrounded.

1830
01:29:31.78 --> 01:29:35.02
So now you're heading back in.

1831
01:29:35.02 --> 01:29:39.34
Yeah, and I am a whole goal is just to get them.

1832
01:29:39.34 --> 01:29:42.38
It was to get them to the road.

1833
01:29:42.38 --> 01:29:47.34
I mean, that was their goal.

1834
01:29:47.34 --> 01:29:50.90
If they could get to the road, they could get in the vehicles.

1835
01:29:50.90 --> 01:29:51.90
They were good.

1836
01:29:51.90 --> 01:29:53.62
So I was trying to push.

1837
01:29:53.62 --> 01:29:56.10
I thought that they had took over a house.

1838
01:29:56.10 --> 01:30:00.30
I thought they had pushed into the village and took over a strong point at our house.

1839
01:30:00.30 --> 01:30:02.58
And that's what I thought they had done.

1840
01:30:02.58 --> 01:30:05.58
I lost communications with them.

1841
01:30:05.58 --> 01:30:07.30
So that thought they had done.

1842
01:30:07.30 --> 01:30:12.46
When a can of food was trying to give that grid, I was trying to write it down.

1843
01:30:12.46 --> 01:30:14.94
Because I knew if I could get that grid, I'd know where they were at.

1844
01:30:14.94 --> 01:30:15.94
I could plot it.

1845
01:30:15.94 --> 01:30:20.06
I could be there and go get them.

1846
01:30:20.06 --> 01:30:23.74
You know, the one part I don't talk about in there is probably the hardest parts

1847
01:30:23.74 --> 01:30:36.50
the whole deal is is that the first trip that I made in, I was probably 70, 60 to 70 meters

1848
01:30:36.50 --> 01:30:37.50
from them.

1849
01:30:37.50 --> 01:30:59.26
They're still alive.

1850
01:30:59.26 --> 01:31:04.54
So you're in the valley now.

1851
01:31:04.54 --> 01:31:09.02
You're with a group of guys going back to the book here, a bullet at the end of the West

1852
01:31:09.02 --> 01:31:15.66
Brooks neck near the shoulder blade and ricochet downward at dangerous but not fatal wound.

1853
01:31:15.66 --> 01:31:18.94
Swenson applied quick-cloth powder and a bandage to seal off the bleeding.

1854
01:31:18.94 --> 01:31:22.30
The flight had been raging for over 90 minutes in the chain of command throughout Koonar

1855
01:31:22.30 --> 01:31:23.90
province was on alert.

1856
01:31:23.90 --> 01:31:29.58
Procedures for releasing helicopters had been unsnarled in 208, 58 kioes were in route to the

1857
01:31:29.58 --> 01:31:30.58
valley.

1858
01:31:30.58 --> 01:31:33.54
That's 07, 15-nate contacted Swenson.

1859
01:31:33.54 --> 01:31:35.62
Highlander, this is pale horse.

1860
01:31:35.62 --> 01:31:38.78
The PC pilot command radioed, what do you need?

1861
01:31:38.78 --> 01:31:44.18
Pale horse swans replied, I am under heavy fire from the village and the hills to the east

1862
01:31:44.18 --> 01:31:48.14
and on both sides, requesting immediate suppression while we pulled back.

1863
01:31:48.14 --> 01:31:51.22
The Kioes squadron had been in Koonar for 10 months.

1864
01:31:51.22 --> 01:31:53.50
The pilots knew the terrain and the enemy habits.

1865
01:31:53.50 --> 01:31:58.10
They intended to swoop in low and crisscrossing strafing runs deliberately swarving and

1866
01:31:58.10 --> 01:31:59.94
cutting back at odd angles.

1867
01:31:59.94 --> 01:32:04.70
They didn't care whether they hit the douchemen, they wanted to force them to crouch down

1868
01:32:04.70 --> 01:32:06.26
and cease firing.

1869
01:32:06.26 --> 01:32:11.62
The aerial tactics would allow the command group to pull back westward to draw down under

1870
01:32:11.62 --> 01:32:14.74
reduced enemy pressure.

1871
01:32:14.74 --> 01:32:20.18
Swenson moved, he called for a metavac, shadow radioed back to that the talk wanted

1872
01:32:20.18 --> 01:32:22.94
questions answered before calling for one.

1873
01:32:22.94 --> 01:32:26.30
Is he army or marine shadow said?

1874
01:32:26.30 --> 01:32:30.10
Wenson cursed, major Williams was more diplomatic.

1875
01:32:30.10 --> 01:32:32.30
This is Fox 6 Williams radioed.

1876
01:32:32.30 --> 01:32:35.14
It doesn't matter his service, he's US.

1877
01:32:35.14 --> 01:32:40.02
There was a pause, then shadow reluctantly radioed, repeat, talk needs to know if he's

1878
01:32:40.02 --> 01:32:41.74
army or marine.

1879
01:32:41.74 --> 01:32:43.22
It's in the regulations.

1880
01:32:43.22 --> 01:32:55.42
Yeah, that was a guy calling for metavac and you're getting a ass today as the person

1881
01:32:55.42 --> 01:32:58.26
needs to casualty arm your marine core.

1882
01:32:58.26 --> 01:33:02.70
Yeah, and it really did matter to him.

1883
01:33:02.70 --> 01:33:04.98
It really did matter to them.

1884
01:33:04.98 --> 01:33:05.98
You're saying it matter?

1885
01:33:05.98 --> 01:33:20.54
I'm saying it to who was asking, they really, their decisions were based off of who it was.

1886
01:33:20.54 --> 01:33:32.82
At this point, you're going back and forth, going back in the valley, getting bodies,

1887
01:33:32.82 --> 01:33:37.06
helping wounded, coming back out, you're under fire the whole time, rod is getting after

1888
01:33:37.06 --> 01:33:38.42
it with you.

1889
01:33:38.42 --> 01:33:41.46
Sometimes you have some US people with you, sometimes you don't.

1890
01:33:41.46 --> 01:33:46.54
Again, these are things you have to buy this book and to get these details out of it and

1891
01:33:46.54 --> 01:33:47.54
read it.

1892
01:33:47.54 --> 01:33:53.50
And the full magnitude of what we're talking about here, going back to the book, I've

1893
01:33:53.50 --> 01:33:58.90
feds left the command group to sort itself out, helping a wounded ass car.

1894
01:33:58.90 --> 01:34:02.42
Was headed back west to the operational release point when I had stopped them.

1895
01:34:02.42 --> 01:34:03.86
I need you to come back in with me.

1896
01:34:03.86 --> 01:34:05.14
I can't find them without you.

1897
01:34:05.14 --> 01:34:08.74
I said, how feds was married recently.

1898
01:34:08.74 --> 01:34:11.22
He was wounded and exhausted.

1899
01:34:11.22 --> 01:34:15.22
He could now go home and have a life.

1900
01:34:15.22 --> 01:34:19.02
If today is my time to die, then I die.

1901
01:34:19.02 --> 01:34:21.54
So he's rolling with you.

1902
01:34:21.54 --> 01:34:24.90
He had, he rolled with me the whole time.

1903
01:34:24.90 --> 01:34:33.82
Again, to all those people out there that, well, I guess I should just say, for the people

1904
01:34:33.82 --> 01:34:38.42
out there that have a hard time understanding, well, what's going on overseas.

1905
01:34:38.42 --> 01:34:44.18
Here's an Afghan soldier that is now going to risk his life to help an American marine

1906
01:34:44.18 --> 01:34:45.18
go and find his friends.

1907
01:34:45.18 --> 01:34:58.70
Yeah, because we were brothers.

1908
01:34:58.70 --> 01:35:03.30
Going back to the book shortly after we headed again down the valley, we bumped into another

1909
01:35:03.30 --> 01:35:05.62
group of wounded ass cars.

1910
01:35:05.62 --> 01:35:09.86
Rod recognized the first sergeant who was dripping blood down the right side of his

1911
01:35:09.86 --> 01:35:10.86
trousers.

1912
01:35:10.86 --> 01:35:15.26
Who's waving his arms, be begging us to stop, four ass cars hobbled over and threw

1913
01:35:15.26 --> 01:35:18.46
themselves into the back seat, splashing blood all over the place.

1914
01:35:18.46 --> 01:35:20.90
We drove them back to the collection point.

1915
01:35:20.90 --> 01:35:25.02
The first sergeant was blubbering, begging us not to go back in.

1916
01:35:25.02 --> 01:35:26.82
I was a little rough shoving amount of the truck.

1917
01:35:26.82 --> 01:35:29.14
I was running out of time and patience.

1918
01:35:29.14 --> 01:35:38.38
Once we dropped them off, we'd gunned it back down the track.

1919
01:35:38.38 --> 01:35:42.70
We were getting to a place where we couldn't turn around and couldn't dodge and weave the

1920
01:35:42.70 --> 01:35:45.98
art as the RPG smoke trails came out of us.

1921
01:35:45.98 --> 01:35:50.30
We could get pretty stuck in here, Rod yelled the truck had very little traction and absolutely

1922
01:35:50.30 --> 01:35:51.74
no cover.

1923
01:35:51.74 --> 01:35:52.98
Then I guess we'll die with them.

1924
01:35:52.98 --> 01:35:54.74
I yelled back.

1925
01:35:54.74 --> 01:35:56.30
What else could I say?

1926
01:35:56.30 --> 01:35:57.74
We weren't going back.

1927
01:35:57.74 --> 01:36:07.62
Rod shifted in the low gear and we bounced forward.

1928
01:36:07.62 --> 01:36:10.50
I noticed this throughout the book.

1929
01:36:10.50 --> 01:36:12.38
You have a hard time.

1930
01:36:12.38 --> 01:36:15.70
Anytime you saw a wounded guy as you were like, all right, we got to make another trip now.

1931
01:36:15.70 --> 01:36:19.14
We got to make another trip, even with those wounded af guys.

1932
01:36:19.14 --> 01:36:21.26
You want to go help you guys, but at the same time you see these guys here.

1933
01:36:21.26 --> 01:36:23.34
I got to get in the truck and we'll take these guys back.

1934
01:36:23.34 --> 01:36:24.90
Got a big heart, bro.

1935
01:36:24.90 --> 01:36:25.90
Got a big heart.

1936
01:36:25.90 --> 01:36:31.06
I mean, look, I didn't just lose.

1937
01:36:31.06 --> 01:36:35.26
I didn't just lose four guys that day.

1938
01:36:35.26 --> 01:36:38.98
I lost 10 guys because I lost six af gans.

1939
01:36:38.98 --> 01:36:39.98
I lost 10 brothers.

1940
01:36:39.98 --> 01:36:40.98
You know what I mean?

1941
01:36:40.98 --> 01:36:43.62
I mean those guys were just as close to me.

1942
01:36:43.62 --> 01:36:53.26
My af gans were just as close to me as any Marines I had reserved with.

1943
01:36:53.26 --> 01:36:55.90
But that's why they're doing you to go back and they're in front.

1944
01:36:55.90 --> 01:36:59.90
That's why I'm alive today.

1945
01:36:59.90 --> 01:37:05.22
I mean that's the relationships that I had with them and the brotherhood that I had

1946
01:37:05.22 --> 01:37:08.34
for them with them is why I'm alive today.

1947
01:37:08.34 --> 01:37:18.74
I mean they are incredible human beings.

1948
01:37:18.74 --> 01:37:21.30
So you're driving around in here.

1949
01:37:21.30 --> 01:37:24.98
Back to the book, only rod skill at the wheel was preventing me from being hit again

1950
01:37:24.98 --> 01:37:25.98
and again.

1951
01:37:25.98 --> 01:37:27.94
Bullets make different sounds when they pass by you.

1952
01:37:27.94 --> 01:37:30.86
The cracks of bullets breaking the sound barrier mean they're high.

1953
01:37:30.86 --> 01:37:32.82
Maybe 5 or 10 feet over your head.

1954
01:37:32.82 --> 01:37:36.46
The bullets that snap close by your ears are the real killers.

1955
01:37:36.46 --> 01:37:40.78
A few losing power and slowing down made a low buzzing sound.

1956
01:37:40.78 --> 01:37:44.18
Strange though it may seem I wasn't scared or angry.

1957
01:37:44.18 --> 01:37:45.82
I was beyond that.

1958
01:37:45.82 --> 01:37:47.82
I didn't think I was going to die.

1959
01:37:47.82 --> 01:37:49.70
I knew I was dead.

1960
01:37:49.70 --> 01:37:51.50
There wasn't anything I could do about it.

1961
01:37:51.50 --> 01:37:54.26
I wasn't a thinking human being.

1962
01:37:54.26 --> 01:37:55.94
I had gone elsewhere.

1963
01:37:55.94 --> 01:37:58.06
I wasn't firing the machine gun.

1964
01:37:58.06 --> 01:38:00.30
I was the machine gun.

1965
01:38:00.30 --> 01:38:02.30
God wasn't driving the truck.

1966
01:38:02.30 --> 01:38:04.30
Rod was the truck.

1967
01:38:04.30 --> 01:38:06.18
I had melded with my weapon.

1968
01:38:06.18 --> 01:38:08.70
I was no more human than a five foot machine gun.

1969
01:38:08.70 --> 01:38:10.34
I was embracing.

1970
01:38:10.34 --> 01:38:12.86
We were locked together, metal and flesh.

1971
01:38:12.86 --> 01:38:19.58
Without that 50 cow I would have quivered like the hascars helpless in the storm.

1972
01:38:19.58 --> 01:38:22.38
But with that weapon I felt transported.

1973
01:38:22.38 --> 01:38:28.62
I had something to do until the blackness came.

1974
01:38:28.62 --> 01:38:32.62
I kept the bullets were hidden inside the turret.

1975
01:38:32.62 --> 01:38:35.22
They had elevation on us.

1976
01:38:35.22 --> 01:38:39.42
They were hidden inside the turret.

1977
01:38:39.42 --> 01:38:42.18
You could hear them coming by.

1978
01:38:42.18 --> 01:38:45.18
I remember sitting there.

1979
01:38:45.18 --> 01:38:50.78
If you get down, you are instinct is to duck down the turret.

1980
01:38:50.78 --> 01:38:51.78
You do that they will run.

1981
01:38:51.78 --> 01:38:55.06
They will run at the truck.

1982
01:38:55.06 --> 01:39:01.38
You duck down their full sprint and you are never going to come back up.

1983
01:39:01.38 --> 01:39:04.22
I just kept waiting for a bullet.

1984
01:39:04.22 --> 01:39:06.58
I just knew it was going to hit me in the face.

1985
01:39:06.58 --> 01:39:08.50
I just kept waiting for a bullet to hit me.

1986
01:39:08.50 --> 01:39:09.50
Light to out.

1987
01:39:09.50 --> 01:39:14.94
I just there was no doubt in my mind that I was going to die.

1988
01:39:14.94 --> 01:39:15.94
Zero.

1989
01:39:15.94 --> 01:39:17.10
Zero to help.

1990
01:39:17.10 --> 01:39:19.38
But I was going to make this son of a bitch.

1991
01:39:19.38 --> 01:39:22.78
They had it to do.

1992
01:39:22.78 --> 01:39:31.78
Jack.

1993
01:39:31.78 --> 01:39:34.06
I wasn't paying attention to the Afghan soldiers.

1994
01:39:34.06 --> 01:39:38.18
Rod and I planned to keep driving east until we were obliterated until we were obliterated

1995
01:39:38.18 --> 01:39:40.38
or we found my team.

1996
01:39:40.38 --> 01:39:44.98
Suddenly with no warning, five or six Oscars who were lying in a terrace about 100 meters

1997
01:39:44.98 --> 01:39:47.10
away, leapt up and race towards our truck.

1998
01:39:47.10 --> 01:39:54.10
And one was shot back and pitched forward when a second man went down screaming when I'm a third

1999
01:39:54.10 --> 01:39:55.26
than a fourth and a fifth.

2000
01:39:55.26 --> 01:39:56.78
I'd never seen anything like it.

2001
01:39:56.78 --> 01:39:58.78
Five men down in five seconds.

2002
01:39:58.78 --> 01:40:02.90
There was so much screeching and shooting that I couldn't pick out the location of the

2003
01:40:02.90 --> 01:40:04.02
weapon that had shot them.

2004
01:40:04.02 --> 01:40:07.50
To deliver such lethal grazing fire, the machine gunner must have been hidden only a few

2005
01:40:07.50 --> 01:40:11.94
hundred meters away with a clear line of sight and his bipod firmly anchored.

2006
01:40:11.94 --> 01:40:16.42
Yet whoever shot those men didn't raise his gun, sights and stitch me.

2007
01:40:16.42 --> 01:40:19.94
I knew he was looking at me but I couldn't see him.

2008
01:40:19.94 --> 01:40:21.10
There was nothing I could do.

2009
01:40:21.10 --> 01:40:22.66
He let me live.

2010
01:40:22.66 --> 01:40:24.46
Not one of his rounds even struck our truck.

2011
01:40:24.46 --> 01:40:28.18
I can't explain it.

2012
01:40:28.18 --> 01:40:30.22
We used to call the trucks bullet magnets.

2013
01:40:30.22 --> 01:40:35.14
I mean, it's like the ripest target and you're the turret gunner.

2014
01:40:35.14 --> 01:40:37.26
You're like the icing on the cake.

2015
01:40:37.26 --> 01:40:40.66
You're the cherry on the icing on the cake.

2016
01:40:40.66 --> 01:40:41.50
Because that truck gets over.

2017
01:40:41.50 --> 01:40:44.66
If they take the gun out that truck doesn't come out of there, it's over ran.

2018
01:40:44.66 --> 01:40:45.98
Oh hell yeah.

2019
01:40:45.98 --> 01:40:50.94
But, you know, even though it's a bullet magnet, I mean, just like right there, I think

2020
01:40:50.94 --> 01:40:53.90
that kind of paints the picture.

2021
01:40:53.90 --> 01:40:56.90
I mean, it's the only chance you have.

2022
01:40:56.90 --> 01:40:58.70
I mean, you're out.

2023
01:40:58.70 --> 01:41:01.42
I mean, that's how dolled in there.

2024
01:41:01.42 --> 01:41:04.94
I mean, I was literally watching guys.

2025
01:41:04.94 --> 01:41:07.42
People feel the turn of miracle around.

2026
01:41:07.42 --> 01:41:12.30
All the time, the fact that you right here, there's five guys within, you know, spitting

2027
01:41:12.30 --> 01:41:17.98
distance from you and they all go down and you're the the most prime target and you

2028
01:41:17.98 --> 01:41:18.98
don't get job.

2029
01:41:18.98 --> 01:41:24.14
You want to talk about helpless, the most helpless feeling you got is watching

2030
01:41:24.14 --> 01:41:30.14
guys trying to get to you and just getting mode down.

2031
01:41:30.14 --> 01:41:34.86
You want to talk about helpless and you don't even know where it's coming from.

2032
01:41:34.86 --> 01:41:42.02
I mean, you want to talk about helpless is watching another human being run directly at you

2033
01:41:42.02 --> 01:41:58.10
to get help and you just watch them just go down one after the other after the other.

2034
01:41:58.10 --> 01:41:59.46
Can you imagine it, dude?

2035
01:41:59.46 --> 01:42:05.74
Yeah, I just didn't, you know, I said they were good that day.

2036
01:42:05.74 --> 01:42:07.78
You get this call from Valdez.

2037
01:42:07.78 --> 01:42:09.34
They're coming at you.

2038
01:42:09.34 --> 01:42:13.18
I can see them closing from both sides, they're swarming you.

2039
01:42:13.18 --> 01:42:17.68
In front of our truck, I saw if you guys sprinting across the wash from left to right,

2040
01:42:17.68 --> 01:42:18.68
head slow.

2041
01:42:18.68 --> 01:42:21.52
I don't think they saw us coming up behind them or if they heard the truck engine over the

2042
01:42:21.52 --> 01:42:22.68
dinner, the gun fire.

2043
01:42:22.68 --> 01:42:26.28
They scurry too quickly for me to get off a burst, glancing to my right.

2044
01:42:26.28 --> 01:42:31.74
I looked smack into the eyes of five or six men in dirty, man dresses, crouched alongside

2045
01:42:31.74 --> 01:42:34.26
a drainage ditch, not 10 meters away.

2046
01:42:34.26 --> 01:42:37.10
When I gaped them, they ducked down like they were playing hide and seek.

2047
01:42:37.10 --> 01:42:41.46
It took me a few seconds to realize that they were spreading out to seal off the open end

2048
01:42:41.46 --> 01:42:48.14
of the horseshoe valley, zip locking the frozen ass cars inside a fire sack, rod and I had

2049
01:42:48.14 --> 01:42:50.46
blundered into their rear.

2050
01:42:50.46 --> 01:42:52.46
So they were about to, they're about to surround everyone.

2051
01:42:52.46 --> 01:42:53.70
So they, that's what they were doing.

2052
01:42:53.70 --> 01:42:55.74
There was a trench and they were closing it.

2053
01:42:55.74 --> 01:43:02.94
They were closing the gate and we, that truck, you happened to be there to be right in it.

2054
01:43:02.94 --> 01:43:07.30
Fire sack is a, is a doctrinal term actually, which means you're surrounded and they're

2055
01:43:07.30 --> 01:43:09.74
going to shoot into the sack and kill everyone.

2056
01:43:09.74 --> 01:43:09.74
Yeah.

2057
01:43:09.74 --> 01:43:16.58
We were bouncing over the rocks, no faster than a man can run when a bearded doucheman

2058
01:43:16.58 --> 01:43:20.70
clutching an AK, left out of a ditch and sprinted after us like a man trying to catch

2059
01:43:20.70 --> 01:43:22.06
his catch a bus.

2060
01:43:22.06 --> 01:43:24.42
My gun almost wouldn't swivel low enough to shoot him.

2061
01:43:24.42 --> 01:43:26.82
The barrel was tilted down as far as it could go.

2062
01:43:26.82 --> 01:43:30.90
I fired into his chest and he went down like he'd hit a glass wall.

2063
01:43:30.90 --> 01:43:33.50
The bullet doesn't blow a man back like in the movies.

2064
01:43:33.50 --> 01:43:36.34
Either he stumbles or on or he falls dead.

2065
01:43:36.34 --> 01:43:38.50
This man fell dead.

2066
01:43:38.50 --> 01:43:39.78
Rod was yelling at me.

2067
01:43:39.78 --> 01:43:42.58
Maybe I was hypnotized for a second by the death.

2068
01:43:42.58 --> 01:43:45.50
There was a guy trying to open the right door.

2069
01:43:45.50 --> 01:43:47.94
I couldn't depress the 50 calvat low.

2070
01:43:47.94 --> 01:43:49.10
I can't get him out yelled.

2071
01:43:49.10 --> 01:43:51.82
The gun won't go down low enough.

2072
01:43:51.82 --> 01:43:55.18
It takes the brain 12,000 of a second to react to danger.

2073
01:43:55.18 --> 01:43:57.10
My mind was a complete blank.

2074
01:43:57.10 --> 01:44:01.90
I had fired so many thousands of rounds that I didn't think what I was doing.

2075
01:44:01.90 --> 01:44:05.02
Once you've practiced emotion long enough, it becomes second nature.

2076
01:44:05.02 --> 01:44:10.54
Some readers, researchers call it expertise induced amnesia.

2077
01:44:10.54 --> 01:44:12.30
Half leads call it being in the zone.

2078
01:44:12.30 --> 01:44:14.30
I call it self preservation.

2079
01:44:14.30 --> 01:44:19.14
I grab my M4 leaned out and shot the guy four or five times in the shoulder and neck.

2080
01:44:19.14 --> 01:44:20.70
It was like shooting a zombie.

2081
01:44:20.70 --> 01:44:26.14
There was no shock power in the little 5.56 millimeter bullets he felt to the ground.

2082
01:44:26.14 --> 01:44:29.34
I pivoted back to the 50 calvand grab the spade handle.

2083
01:44:29.34 --> 01:44:34.42
The weapon my hands and my eyes were working as a trained unit independent of my brain.

2084
01:44:34.42 --> 01:44:36.74
Man, sight, picture, shoot.

2085
01:44:36.74 --> 01:44:38.46
Man, sight picture, shoot.

2086
01:44:38.46 --> 01:44:39.70
You don't really look at the target.

2087
01:44:39.70 --> 01:44:41.14
The enemy remains out of focus.

2088
01:44:41.14 --> 01:44:42.78
You concentrate on the sight picture.

2089
01:44:42.78 --> 01:44:44.62
Man, sight picture, shoot.

2090
01:44:44.62 --> 01:44:49.18
I hit one or two guys next to the truck and the others duck back into the ditch.

2091
01:44:49.18 --> 01:44:50.62
Valdez came back on the radio.

2092
01:44:50.62 --> 01:44:52.02
Rod, watch your front.

2093
01:44:52.02 --> 01:44:54.66
Rod was focused on keeping traction in the loose gravel.

2094
01:44:54.66 --> 01:44:57.38
The truck got stuck even for a moment we'd be toast.

2095
01:44:57.38 --> 01:45:02.14
He looked ahead to see a bearded, hatless man in his mid 30s dressed in a brick red man

2096
01:45:02.14 --> 01:45:06.82
jams with a green chest rig full of ammo running toward the truck and firing an AK out

2097
01:45:06.82 --> 01:45:08.66
us from the hip.

2098
01:45:08.66 --> 01:45:11.14
Hold on, homie, Rod yelled.

2099
01:45:11.14 --> 01:45:12.58
He hit the accelerator.

2100
01:45:12.58 --> 01:45:14.54
The truck hit the man squarely in the chest.

2101
01:45:14.54 --> 01:45:17.58
There was a bump and then another bump under the tires.

2102
01:45:17.58 --> 01:45:19.42
Holy shit, Rod yelled.

2103
01:45:19.42 --> 01:45:21.58
I just ran over a guy.

2104
01:45:21.58 --> 01:45:26.34
Back up and do it again.

2105
01:45:26.34 --> 01:45:30.06
I'd been shot in the elbow, a bleeder that did no real damage.

2106
01:45:30.06 --> 01:45:31.50
The bone was fine.

2107
01:45:31.50 --> 01:45:33.82
In a fight, adrenaline deadens the pain.

2108
01:45:33.82 --> 01:45:36.82
I did a little wrapping and got back to shooting.

2109
01:45:36.82 --> 01:45:41.54
The more fucked up things got, the more Rod and I started laughing.

2110
01:45:41.54 --> 01:45:45.66
He was staring away from RPG, streaming at us and laughing and I was shooting the big gun

2111
01:45:45.66 --> 01:45:46.66
and laughing.

2112
01:45:46.66 --> 01:45:51.70
Definitely crazy, but your emotions have to go somewhere.

2113
01:45:51.70 --> 01:45:55.54
The enemy fire slack and Anna says the guy was darted around.

2114
01:45:55.54 --> 01:45:57.50
They were like a steel umbrella over us.

2115
01:45:57.50 --> 01:46:00.98
A few minutes later, pale horse came back on my net.

2116
01:46:00.98 --> 01:46:02.50
Three, three were Winchester.

2117
01:46:02.50 --> 01:46:06.94
When we back in 15 mics, Winchester meant they'd expend it all their ammunition.

2118
01:46:06.94 --> 01:46:10.70
They were too light to carry much and they'd been shooting at targets wherever they looked.

2119
01:46:10.70 --> 01:46:12.38
The firing kicked up.

2120
01:46:12.38 --> 01:46:14.78
We were again the pinniana.

2121
01:46:14.78 --> 01:46:18.94
I climbed down from the turret and talked to talk to Rod and Huffes.

2122
01:46:18.94 --> 01:46:20.78
We had started with six ammo cans.

2123
01:46:20.78 --> 01:46:21.78
We were now down to one.

2124
01:46:21.78 --> 01:46:24.94
I had fired more than 2,000 rounds.

2125
01:46:24.94 --> 01:46:25.94
Guys we need a new gun.

2126
01:46:25.94 --> 01:46:28.50
I said it was three steps forward, two steps back.

2127
01:46:28.50 --> 01:46:32.26
As we turned, I saw an ask our free crawling feebly toward the road.

2128
01:46:32.26 --> 01:46:33.70
We stopped and I hopped out.

2129
01:46:33.70 --> 01:46:37.82
A PKM machine gun was telling the ground around me so I dodged back and forth until

2130
01:46:37.82 --> 01:46:38.98
I reached him.

2131
01:46:38.98 --> 01:46:43.86
One Kiyua out of ammo hovered above me and distracted the enemy ignoring the RPG shells

2132
01:46:43.86 --> 01:46:45.86
exploding in the air.

2133
01:46:45.86 --> 01:46:48.02
I turned the ask our onto his back.

2134
01:46:48.02 --> 01:46:50.30
Hit by three rounds and his upper chest and neck.

2135
01:46:50.30 --> 01:46:53.70
He was gurgling and drowning in his own blood.

2136
01:46:53.70 --> 01:47:07.30
I rolled him onto his side and he died before I could pick him up.

2137
01:47:07.30 --> 01:47:13.54
Yeah, like you can see I kind of circle things that I'm going to read.

2138
01:47:13.54 --> 01:47:20.54
I just was like circling giant chunks to people can understand what.

2139
01:47:20.54 --> 01:47:25.22
I know that people aren't going to understand the chronological evolution and maybe the

2140
01:47:25.22 --> 01:47:28.58
mechanics of what was happening but I want people at least to understand until they read

2141
01:47:28.58 --> 01:47:34.54
this book themselves to freaking situation that you were in which was beyond mayhem.

2142
01:47:34.54 --> 01:47:38.18
You know you talk about training like to the worst case scenario.

2143
01:47:38.18 --> 01:47:44.38
I always had done the same thing and this was worse than any worst case scenario that

2144
01:47:44.38 --> 01:47:48.90
I could have ever, ever dreamed up of, I've ever been in.

2145
01:47:48.90 --> 01:47:52.42
It was the worst of any situation.

2146
01:47:52.42 --> 01:47:57.74
I could have never sit here and you said, give me the worst thing you could just come

2147
01:47:57.74 --> 01:47:59.38
up with and I could have never done it.

2148
01:47:59.38 --> 01:48:03.50
I could have never, I could have never done it.

2149
01:48:03.50 --> 01:48:14.02
I mean you just, I mean it's just like, I mean I just felt like everybody was dying.

2150
01:48:14.02 --> 01:48:20.02
I mean it was just, I mean they were literally, they were bodies everywhere.

2151
01:48:20.02 --> 01:48:28.98
I mean you couldn't turn around and look and they're not be a body somewhere.

2152
01:48:28.98 --> 01:48:34.02
And you just pretty much figured you were going to be joining them soon enough.

2153
01:48:34.02 --> 01:48:35.02
No I did.

2154
01:48:35.02 --> 01:48:40.34
I mean there was no doubt, there was no doubt in my mind I wasn't making it either.

2155
01:48:40.34 --> 01:48:44.30
And you know I walked in that day and it's just shows you how ignorant I was.

2156
01:48:44.30 --> 01:48:50.30
Like when you talk about your buddy who was kind of like puffed a chest up right, that

2157
01:48:50.30 --> 01:48:51.30
was me.

2158
01:48:51.30 --> 01:48:54.98
I literally, I'm going to tell you I'm going to just tell you how ignorant I was.

2159
01:48:54.98 --> 01:49:02.54
I walked in that day and I, there was not a situation that I was ever going to see that

2160
01:49:02.54 --> 01:49:05.70
I couldn't get us out of.

2161
01:49:05.70 --> 01:49:06.54
There wasn't one.

2162
01:49:06.54 --> 01:49:10.34
There wasn't one.

2163
01:49:10.34 --> 01:49:21.94
And it was like, you know, it was like God showed me, just how smart it was.

2164
01:49:21.94 --> 01:49:29.46
You know, you got to take, I mean these, these afghan soldiers, I mean they're my

2165
01:49:29.46 --> 01:49:30.46
buddies.

2166
01:49:30.46 --> 01:49:35.26
You know, and part of the problem was how long did deployment was this?

2167
01:49:35.26 --> 01:49:36.26
Sposed to been nine months.

2168
01:49:36.26 --> 01:49:38.26
And how long this went to this happened?

2169
01:49:38.26 --> 01:49:41.90
We got there in July, August of September.

2170
01:49:41.90 --> 01:49:42.90
Yeah.

2171
01:49:42.90 --> 01:49:45.18
So this is like two or three months of deployment.

2172
01:49:45.18 --> 01:49:51.02
And part of the problem was we just done the NATO transition and they were using weapon systems

2173
01:49:51.02 --> 01:49:55.10
that they weren't used to, that you to smaller around.

2174
01:49:55.10 --> 01:49:56.10
Yeah.

2175
01:49:56.10 --> 01:49:58.46
Yeah, a lot.

2176
01:49:58.46 --> 01:49:59.86
But they weren't used to these weapons.

2177
01:49:59.86 --> 01:50:02.22
They weren't even used to them for us.

2178
01:50:02.22 --> 01:50:05.86
I mean, and then for us are so much more fickle.

2179
01:50:05.86 --> 01:50:11.42
M16, M16, M16 are well even more so than then for M16s are so much more fickle than

2180
01:50:11.42 --> 01:50:12.42
an AK.

2181
01:50:12.42 --> 01:50:14.06
They must have been cursing them down.

2182
01:50:14.06 --> 01:50:15.46
Oh, they have M16s.

2183
01:50:15.46 --> 01:50:16.46
Oh, they were.

2184
01:50:16.46 --> 01:50:17.46
I mean, they were.

2185
01:50:17.46 --> 01:50:18.46
Oh, yeah.

2186
01:50:18.46 --> 01:50:20.90
I mean, they, you know, they would have

2187
01:50:20.90 --> 01:50:23.86
something go wrong and they would just drop the magazine.

2188
01:50:23.86 --> 01:50:28.74
I mean, I mean, they would just, yeah.

2189
01:50:28.74 --> 01:50:35.06
So I got telling you, if you say everything, like we had just, so we just hit Ramadan.

2190
01:50:35.06 --> 01:50:36.74
So none of them were drinking water.

2191
01:50:36.74 --> 01:50:37.74
None of them were eating.

2192
01:50:37.74 --> 01:50:40.26
We had just, I mean, you look at every factor to this.

2193
01:50:40.26 --> 01:50:41.66
It was the perfect storm.

2194
01:50:41.66 --> 01:50:42.74
And we had just transitioned.

2195
01:50:42.74 --> 01:50:47.02
This is the first mission, the first or second mission that we had ever went on with

2196
01:50:47.02 --> 01:50:48.42
all NATO weapons.

2197
01:50:48.42 --> 01:50:53.70
I mean, you look at all these factors and it was, it was perfect.

2198
01:50:53.70 --> 01:50:56.86
Had you ever worked with the QRF before?

2199
01:50:56.86 --> 01:50:59.22
Oh, not not that one.

2200
01:50:59.22 --> 01:51:01.82
I was used to the ones, you know, up near where you were at.

2201
01:51:01.82 --> 01:51:05.74
But you had no interoperability with those guys before.

2202
01:51:05.74 --> 01:51:08.10
No, and they got shut down.

2203
01:51:08.10 --> 01:51:13.22
So after the talk learned that it was Marines, they got shut down.

2204
01:51:13.22 --> 01:51:18.10
All support stopped.

2205
01:51:18.10 --> 01:51:28.10
All support stopped.

2206
01:51:28.10 --> 01:51:31.26
All right.

2207
01:51:31.26 --> 01:51:37.22
Um, sometimes I got nothing to say.

2208
01:51:37.22 --> 01:51:38.22
And that's one of them.

2209
01:51:38.22 --> 01:51:40.66
I had to get even comprehend that.

2210
01:51:40.66 --> 01:51:41.66
Yeah.

2211
01:51:41.66 --> 01:51:42.66
All right.

2212
01:51:42.66 --> 01:51:46.74
We're going back to the book.

2213
01:51:46.74 --> 01:51:50.86
We turned left out of the wash onto the narrow track back to the casualty collection

2214
01:51:50.86 --> 01:51:51.86
point.

2215
01:51:51.86 --> 01:51:52.86
I looked around for Major Williams.

2216
01:51:52.86 --> 01:51:55.78
He was sitting off to one side wounded in a shock.

2217
01:51:55.78 --> 01:51:59.06
There were four or five vehicles in at least 20 ass cars milling around.

2218
01:51:59.06 --> 01:52:00.18
These were our Afghans.

2219
01:52:00.18 --> 01:52:01.98
We had come down from Monti together.

2220
01:52:01.98 --> 01:52:05.46
I glanced hopefully from the group from group to group.

2221
01:52:05.46 --> 01:52:08.06
Huffes was asking if they'd seen Lieutenant Johnson.

2222
01:52:08.06 --> 01:52:09.86
They say Lieutenant is back in Gangegall.

2223
01:52:09.86 --> 01:52:11.74
Said, how fast said?

2224
01:52:11.74 --> 01:52:14.10
The team didn't make it out.

2225
01:52:14.10 --> 01:52:15.10
Shit.

2226
01:52:15.10 --> 01:52:22.06
Somewhere farther up the wash, my team was fighting to stay alive.

2227
01:52:22.06 --> 01:52:24.50
I'd promised to get them and rod.

2228
01:52:24.50 --> 01:52:30.54
And I had the only gun truck willing to enable to go in.

2229
01:52:30.54 --> 01:52:33.18
I climbed down from the turret and ran over to the Ascar.

2230
01:52:33.18 --> 01:52:35.62
He'd taken a bullet in the fire and he was slowly bleeding out.

2231
01:52:35.62 --> 01:52:39.02
I kept a stack of turnikets in my med back and knew how to apply them.

2232
01:52:39.02 --> 01:52:41.54
I wrapped the turniket around his thigh and my frustration.

2233
01:52:41.54 --> 01:52:43.26
I twisted it extra tight.

2234
01:52:43.26 --> 01:52:45.46
He screamed, how fast tell him to shut up.

2235
01:52:45.46 --> 01:52:49.46
I said, hurting is better than dying.

2236
01:52:49.46 --> 01:52:52.30
If you're a grunt, you'll come face to face with horrendous gore.

2237
01:52:52.30 --> 01:52:56.02
You have to steal yourself to seeing mangled bodies and smelling blood.

2238
01:52:56.02 --> 01:52:58.90
Doctors and nurses cope with screaming and suffering every day.

2239
01:52:58.90 --> 01:53:00.86
I addressed out dozens of deer.

2240
01:53:00.86 --> 01:53:04.70
You learned to disassociate from the task when you're pulling out warm guts or cutting

2241
01:53:04.70 --> 01:53:12.70
off slabs of dripping meat with the blood sticking to your hands.

2242
01:53:12.70 --> 01:53:15.30
You went through something like 15 turnikets?

2243
01:53:15.30 --> 01:53:17.66
Yeah, at least.

2244
01:53:17.66 --> 01:53:21.42
Quite a few vials and more fun.

2245
01:53:21.42 --> 01:53:27.42
A couple of needle decompressions.

2246
01:53:27.42 --> 01:53:35.94
MPA is quite a few MPA's nasal.

2247
01:53:35.94 --> 01:53:41.46
The coy was at rearm and come back on station, directing us toward another wounded.

2248
01:53:41.46 --> 01:53:44.82
Like it or not, we had been pressed into ambulance business.

2249
01:53:44.82 --> 01:53:49.22
The coy was commanded by chief horn officer, Yassarian Salano.

2250
01:53:49.22 --> 01:53:56.18
A good name for a guy in a crazy war had been a marine grunt before becoming an army pilot.

2251
01:53:56.18 --> 01:54:00.98
His bird was easy to talk to and he directed me where to go, sometimes hovering so low,

2252
01:54:00.98 --> 01:54:03.94
I could just about reach up and touch his skids.

2253
01:54:03.94 --> 01:54:07.58
He was covering my rear area when I got out of the truck.

2254
01:54:07.58 --> 01:54:09.22
The pilots were fearless.

2255
01:54:09.22 --> 01:54:13.30
Following my team was lost, they were running search patterns 20 feet off the ground so they

2256
01:54:13.30 --> 01:54:15.66
could identify each body.

2257
01:54:15.66 --> 01:54:16.66
Damn.

2258
01:54:16.66 --> 01:54:20.46
Yeah, I mean, and he did that like, you know, they were so his commander, he was having

2259
01:54:20.46 --> 01:54:24.38
problems with his commander and the guy who was leading those birds, you know, because

2260
01:54:24.38 --> 01:54:26.98
they fly in two birds.

2261
01:54:26.98 --> 01:54:35.14
But when I told him that it was marine's missing, he dropped down and covered me the whole

2262
01:54:35.14 --> 01:54:36.14
time.

2263
01:54:36.14 --> 01:54:40.38
You ever meet him?

2264
01:54:40.38 --> 01:54:41.38
Yeah, yeah.

2265
01:54:41.38 --> 01:54:43.38
He's incredible.

2266
01:54:43.38 --> 01:54:45.86
I just seen him like around Thanksgiving.

2267
01:54:45.86 --> 01:54:48.98
He is an incredible human being.

2268
01:54:48.98 --> 01:54:52.78
Just so everyone knows, just because you're in a helicopter does not make you save at all.

2269
01:54:52.78 --> 01:54:55.58
Especially a coyote, like maybe you're a little bit safer in a patchy because you've

2270
01:54:55.58 --> 01:54:56.58
got some armor.

2271
01:54:56.58 --> 01:54:57.58
How much are there's an a coyote?

2272
01:54:57.58 --> 01:54:58.58
Zero, right?

2273
01:54:58.58 --> 01:54:59.58
They look like little.

2274
01:54:59.58 --> 01:55:04.02
And I don't know how many his bird was shot to shit.

2275
01:55:04.02 --> 01:55:05.02
No kidding.

2276
01:55:05.02 --> 01:55:06.02
Yeah.

2277
01:55:06.02 --> 01:55:13.54
Yeah, it was shot to pieces.

2278
01:55:13.54 --> 01:55:17.18
I climbed up a terrace wall and followed the contours of the field around a corner to find

2279
01:55:17.18 --> 01:55:18.90
a body-lying face down.

2280
01:55:18.90 --> 01:55:21.30
On the man's hands were green gloves with a fingers cut.

2281
01:55:21.30 --> 01:55:25.06
A new B4, I even rolled them over that it was dodgy.

2282
01:55:25.06 --> 01:55:27.38
My closest afghan friend.

2283
01:55:27.38 --> 01:55:29.50
He was due to take leave in a few weeks.

2284
01:55:29.50 --> 01:55:34.18
He had left on Brad terms with his mother who was sure he would be killed.

2285
01:55:34.18 --> 01:55:40.58
Finally, after two years, she had relented and invited him back to the farm for a visit.

2286
01:55:40.58 --> 01:55:43.02
He'd been hit in the face.

2287
01:55:43.02 --> 01:55:48.90
When I looked at his dull eyes, I lost my concentration and knelt there for a moment oblivious.

2288
01:55:48.90 --> 01:55:51.98
He was a little guy too small for his body armor.

2289
01:55:51.98 --> 01:55:57.70
He and I had rigged up two turnucuits to hold the body armor in place close to his chest.

2290
01:55:57.70 --> 01:56:00.18
I knelt down to untie the turnucuits.

2291
01:56:00.18 --> 01:56:05.54
I needed them for other guys and I needed to get the heavy armor off him.

2292
01:56:05.54 --> 01:56:09.98
So I could gary him to the truck.

2293
01:56:09.98 --> 01:56:13.34
I felt a tap as something hit my left shoulder.

2294
01:56:13.34 --> 01:56:15.06
It didn't register at first.

2295
01:56:15.06 --> 01:56:16.86
It was like I'd been hit with a light stone.

2296
01:56:16.86 --> 01:56:22.02
I'd glanced up to see a tough looking afghan with a long black beard glaring down at me.

2297
01:56:22.02 --> 01:56:26.86
He was wearing a dirty gray mandress of flack jacket and an afghan or a me helmet.

2298
01:56:26.86 --> 01:56:32.66
He was pulling an AK at my head gesturing for me to stand up and broken English.

2299
01:56:32.66 --> 01:56:35.18
He was telling me to drop my rifle.

2300
01:56:35.18 --> 01:56:40.54
Come, he said waving the barrel of his AK in my face.

2301
01:56:40.54 --> 01:56:43.34
I couldn't believe that I'd screwed up so badly.

2302
01:56:43.34 --> 01:56:50.30
All I could think of was that my head would be sought off and held up on TV.

2303
01:56:50.30 --> 01:56:52.38
No way.

2304
01:56:52.38 --> 01:56:55.18
I'd die right where I was right now.

2305
01:56:55.18 --> 01:56:57.66
I'd been dead for a few hours anyways.

2306
01:56:57.66 --> 01:56:58.98
The borrowed time was up.

2307
01:56:58.98 --> 01:57:00.46
That's all.

2308
01:57:00.46 --> 01:57:04.06
My rifle was resting on my left thigh pointing in his direction.

2309
01:57:04.06 --> 01:57:08.02
The stubby grenade launcher was attached to the underside of the barrel.

2310
01:57:08.02 --> 01:57:12.82
I raised one arm like I was going to surrender and pulled the trigger of the launcher with my free thumb.

2311
01:57:12.82 --> 01:57:16.78
The 40 millimeter grenade shot forward to feet to his armored vest.

2312
01:57:16.78 --> 01:57:18.22
It didn't explode.

2313
01:57:18.22 --> 01:57:23.66
Instead it knocked him back, stunned him with the breath, slammed out of him.

2314
01:57:23.66 --> 01:57:26.18
He staggered back and fell on his side.

2315
01:57:26.18 --> 01:57:28.50
For a few seconds I fought the blow and killed him.

2316
01:57:28.50 --> 01:57:30.42
No such luck.

2317
01:57:30.42 --> 01:57:32.30
I pushed myself erect.

2318
01:57:32.30 --> 01:57:35.10
As I pushed myself erect, he drew in a big breath and stirred.

2319
01:57:35.10 --> 01:57:38.50
I kicked that his face losing my balance and falling on top of him.

2320
01:57:38.50 --> 01:57:40.30
We were both on the ground wrestling.

2321
01:57:40.30 --> 01:57:44.18
Afghan tribesmen have legs like steel from climbing mountains all day.

2322
01:57:44.18 --> 01:57:46.50
All their lives so I had to keep his legs off me.

2323
01:57:46.50 --> 01:57:49.34
I pinned his elbows and blocked his reach for his AK.

2324
01:57:49.34 --> 01:57:53.62
I was pushing my helmet head into his chest so he couldn't gouge at my eyes.

2325
01:57:53.62 --> 01:57:58.38
Any second I figured that grenade would explode and both of us could stop worrying about any

2326
01:57:58.38 --> 01:58:00.02
of this.

2327
01:58:00.02 --> 01:58:03.94
I pawed the ground with my right hand and found a rock the size of a baseball.

2328
01:58:03.94 --> 01:58:06.94
I clutched it and swung blindly at his face.

2329
01:58:06.94 --> 01:58:08.22
The blow stunned him.

2330
01:58:08.22 --> 01:58:13.06
Before he could recover, I pushed off of his chest lifted the rock high and my right fist

2331
01:58:13.06 --> 01:58:16.26
and smashed it down like a hammer breaking his front teeth.

2332
01:58:16.26 --> 01:58:18.82
He looked me in the eyes, the fight knocked out of him.

2333
01:58:18.82 --> 01:58:20.70
His head not moving.

2334
01:58:20.70 --> 01:58:22.66
We both knew it was over.

2335
01:58:22.66 --> 01:58:27.30
I drew back my arm and drove the stone down crushing his left cheekbone.

2336
01:58:27.30 --> 01:58:28.54
He went limp.

2337
01:58:28.54 --> 01:58:32.18
I pushed up on my knees and I hit him with more force.

2338
01:58:32.18 --> 01:58:34.98
The blow caved in the left side of his forehead.

2339
01:58:34.98 --> 01:58:53.70
I smashed his face again and again, driven by pure animal rage.

2340
01:58:53.70 --> 01:58:58.70
That's close combat, obviously when you're killing another human being with a rock.

2341
01:58:58.70 --> 01:58:59.70
Yeah.

2342
01:58:59.70 --> 01:59:09.42
Yeah, it's real.

2343
01:59:09.42 --> 01:59:11.22
I just remember his face.

2344
01:59:11.22 --> 01:59:17.58
I mean, look, let me just state this up front.

2345
01:59:17.58 --> 01:59:22.18
First off, I feel no remorse at all.

2346
01:59:22.18 --> 01:59:27.34
I think it was at that point to where humanized it.

2347
01:59:27.34 --> 01:59:29.78
Does that make sense?

2348
01:59:29.78 --> 01:59:32.30
It's like it humanized.

2349
01:59:32.30 --> 01:59:38.34
The fact of taking another person's life, I would remember the looking his eyes when he knew

2350
01:59:38.34 --> 01:59:41.02
he was going to die.

2351
01:59:41.02 --> 01:59:44.30
At that point, I obviously didn't think of it then.

2352
01:59:44.30 --> 01:59:48.66
But when I still see that face, I still think about, you know, he was a father.

2353
01:59:48.66 --> 01:59:51.18
There was somebody at home that wanted him to come home.

2354
01:59:51.18 --> 01:59:54.98
Just as bad as somebody, wanted me to come home.

2355
01:59:54.98 --> 01:59:58.86
Whether you agree with his beliefs or not, people don't agree with their beliefs, but

2356
01:59:58.86 --> 02:00:02.98
the other day he believed in his beliefs just as much as I did.

2357
02:00:02.98 --> 02:00:04.78
We're both human beings.

2358
02:00:04.78 --> 02:00:10.10
We're both fighting for a cause that neither one of us can see that we both just believe

2359
02:00:10.10 --> 02:00:13.58
in.

2360
02:00:13.58 --> 02:00:17.14
And it had to be one of us.

2361
02:00:17.14 --> 02:00:22.22
And my guess is, and you can maybe I'm wrong, but my guess is the reason he didn't

2362
02:00:22.22 --> 02:00:30.86
just straight kill you is because you had the drop on you and having you as a trophy in

2363
02:00:30.86 --> 02:00:37.18
an orange jumpsuit would have been much more impactful for him and their cause.

2364
02:00:37.18 --> 02:00:41.86
Yeah, I mean, he could have easily, it would have took him no time to get me across the

2365
02:00:41.86 --> 02:00:42.86
border.

2366
02:00:42.86 --> 02:00:43.86
We were right on the border.

2367
02:00:43.86 --> 02:00:44.86
That's what he would have done.

2368
02:00:44.86 --> 02:00:46.86
He would have took me across the border to sold me.

2369
02:00:46.86 --> 02:00:47.86
He would have been a hero.

2370
02:00:47.86 --> 02:00:50.50
He'd probably been promoted and whatever network he was in.

2371
02:00:50.50 --> 02:00:55.42
I mean, he would have been the man and I was worth a lot more to him alive than I was

2372
02:00:55.42 --> 02:00:56.42
there.

2373
02:00:56.42 --> 02:00:57.42
Yeah.

2374
02:00:57.42 --> 02:01:00.86
But then on the back side, I mean, I've questioned it so many times, was it that or

2375
02:01:00.86 --> 02:01:04.06
was it maybe he was trying to bluff me, didn't have bullets?

2376
02:01:04.06 --> 02:01:05.06
I don't know.

2377
02:01:05.06 --> 02:01:06.06
I don't know.

2378
02:01:06.06 --> 02:01:17.70
I can, there's so many times in this whole battle that I just wonder like, why not me?

2379
02:01:17.70 --> 02:01:22.14
I mean, war and I guess you could apply it all life, but it becomes very clear to war.

2380
02:01:22.14 --> 02:01:28.82
It's like inches, millimeters, you know, what, what, sure you could say you got missed by

2381
02:01:28.82 --> 02:01:32.14
around by a foot, a couple inches.

2382
02:01:32.14 --> 02:01:36.74
But when you take that back to a person's weapon, you got missed by a millimeter, a meter

2383
02:01:36.74 --> 02:01:37.74
of aim.

2384
02:01:37.74 --> 02:01:40.14
That's what it is.

2385
02:01:40.14 --> 02:01:46.02
You could have got, you could have got missed by a gust of wind.

2386
02:01:46.02 --> 02:01:47.02
Mm-hmm.

2387
02:01:47.02 --> 02:01:55.86
Literally, you could have, you could have been missed by the wind picking up.

2388
02:01:55.86 --> 02:02:02.66
So while all that's going on, back to the book, Highlander was the radio call sign for

2389
02:02:02.66 --> 02:02:03.98
Captain Swenson.

2390
02:02:03.98 --> 02:02:05.94
He was trying to gather reinforcements.

2391
02:02:05.94 --> 02:02:09.58
He pulled aside the lieutenant in charge of the quick reaction, pulled tune, mount up,

2392
02:02:09.58 --> 02:02:13.50
Swenson and told him, you know how back here, we need your firepower.

2393
02:02:13.50 --> 02:02:15.46
I can't, Lieutenant said.

2394
02:02:15.46 --> 02:02:18.54
The talk says we're to cover the vehicles.

2395
02:02:18.54 --> 02:02:22.10
Swenson grabbed the lieutenant's 50-watt radio called the Joyce.

2396
02:02:22.10 --> 02:02:26.42
The talk told the Pultoon to move into the valley.

2397
02:02:26.42 --> 02:02:33.62
Swenson, Fabio, Rod, and Huffes then hopped into an undamaged humvee to drive back in.

2398
02:02:33.62 --> 02:02:35.46
But the Pultoon did not follow.

2399
02:02:35.46 --> 02:02:39.58
Instead the Pultoon leader again called back to Joyce and somehow received permission

2400
02:02:39.58 --> 02:02:46.58
to remain in the rear out of the fight.

2401
02:02:46.58 --> 02:02:48.22
Yeah, it was frustrating.

2402
02:02:48.22 --> 02:02:49.22
It was frustrating.

2403
02:02:49.22 --> 02:02:58.10
It was frustrating that, you know, I met that guy a few years ago.

2404
02:02:58.10 --> 02:02:59.10
We ran into it.

2405
02:02:59.10 --> 02:03:03.18
We were in the same meeting.

2406
02:03:03.18 --> 02:03:04.90
It was frustrating.

2407
02:03:04.90 --> 02:03:06.18
Every bit of it was frustrating.

2408
02:03:06.18 --> 02:03:13.18
It was so, I mean, every single bit of it was unnecessary.

2409
02:03:13.18 --> 02:03:24.94
I started the day with 14 or 16 turnic hits.

2410
02:03:24.94 --> 02:03:26.42
I used them all.

2411
02:03:26.42 --> 02:03:31.10
I put four on one guy who'd lost his left arm and his left leg below the knee.

2412
02:03:31.10 --> 02:03:32.10
He survived.

2413
02:03:32.10 --> 02:03:35.94
One asked our shot and the next sounded like he was slurping through a straw.

2414
02:03:35.94 --> 02:03:42.70
There was nothing I could do except listen to him, strangled to death.

2415
02:03:42.70 --> 02:03:47.94
At one point two F-T-F-15's roared low through the valley opening their afterburners to

2416
02:03:47.94 --> 02:03:51.66
create a hell of a lion's roar.

2417
02:03:51.66 --> 02:03:58.10
The pilots wouldn't drop any bombs.

2418
02:03:58.10 --> 02:04:04.26
Yeah, I mean, you know, usually, but at this point, you know, the only show of force

2419
02:04:04.26 --> 02:04:07.46
ever works is, I mean, they had so much momentum at this time.

2420
02:04:07.46 --> 02:04:09.30
I mean, it was like momentum, right?

2421
02:04:09.30 --> 02:04:13.30
So it started out as fighters, like as fighters that came across the border.

2422
02:04:13.30 --> 02:04:16.42
And then what it turned into was when they seen that we weren't getting the support and

2423
02:04:16.42 --> 02:04:19.50
when they, they seen that we weren't getting control of the situation and fires weren't

2424
02:04:19.50 --> 02:04:20.50
coming.

2425
02:04:20.50 --> 02:04:22.02
They escalated in the game momentum.

2426
02:04:22.02 --> 02:04:27.46
Well, everybody else joined in, you take, so you had the guys that showed up to fight.

2427
02:04:27.46 --> 02:04:31.74
And then you have the opportunist of the villagers that turned into fighters instantly

2428
02:04:31.74 --> 02:04:33.82
because they have the upper hand.

2429
02:04:33.82 --> 02:04:37.82
So they start gaining momentum of more people fighting you every single minute because

2430
02:04:37.82 --> 02:04:40.14
all they got to do is pick up the gun off the dead person.

2431
02:04:40.14 --> 02:04:46.50
You know, literally, I mean, they were literally women running through the village with

2432
02:04:46.50 --> 02:04:49.22
like these bowls.

2433
02:04:49.22 --> 02:04:53.94
And you know, you look at them, you know, well, you know, she's just a woman with a bowl,

2434
02:04:53.94 --> 02:04:55.94
running.

2435
02:04:55.94 --> 02:04:59.54
Rocket comes in, she drops a bowl and it's full of grenades and ammunition.

2436
02:04:59.54 --> 02:05:09.78
The women were running up and re-esupplying all these guys.

2437
02:05:09.78 --> 02:05:13.46
The Kai was, we're still supporting you back to the book.

2438
02:05:13.46 --> 02:05:18.86
Inside the villages, the army pilots ran astonishing risks to find my team.

2439
02:05:18.86 --> 02:05:24.42
A Kai will swoop down toward the compound, flare back at rooftop level and putter down

2440
02:05:24.42 --> 02:05:29.82
the alleyways at 20 miles an hour, allowing the pilots to peer into every backyard and into

2441
02:05:29.82 --> 02:05:32.82
every window.

2442
02:05:32.82 --> 02:05:37.54
As the day grew hotter, we gradually cleared the valley of casualties over 30 wounded or dead

2443
02:05:37.54 --> 02:05:45.22
were evacuated.

2444
02:05:45.22 --> 02:05:49.26
We watched a salon over the lead pilot brought his Kai went down to a few feet above

2445
02:05:49.26 --> 02:05:52.82
a trench and hovered there.

2446
02:05:52.82 --> 02:05:56.82
My lander, we spotted five bodies.

2447
02:05:56.82 --> 02:05:58.82
I'd heard all I needed.

2448
02:05:58.82 --> 02:06:02.50
I jumped out the door and sprinted across the field to the right, opening some distance

2449
02:06:02.50 --> 02:06:05.26
before swans and yelled at me.

2450
02:06:05.26 --> 02:06:07.74
I ignored him, knowing he'd be right behind me.

2451
02:06:07.74 --> 02:06:12.02
A PKM shifted me, shifted to me when I was halfway across the terrace.

2452
02:06:12.02 --> 02:06:20.86
I hopped over a terrace wall and fell into a deep, well constructed trench.

2453
02:06:20.86 --> 02:06:25.34
I landed next to Gony Johnson and my heart stopped.

2454
02:06:25.34 --> 02:06:28.26
He was lying on his back with his arms outspread.

2455
02:06:28.26 --> 02:06:34.54
His eyes open, but never to see anything again on this earth.

2456
02:06:34.54 --> 02:06:39.34
A few feet further on, I came across the body of an afghan and turperger who had traveled

2457
02:06:39.34 --> 02:06:41.86
with our team.

2458
02:06:41.86 --> 02:06:44.86
I felt sick to my stomach.

2459
02:06:44.86 --> 02:06:49.66
I knew what I would see next.

2460
02:06:49.66 --> 02:06:54.22
Lieutenant Johnson lay on his back with his eyes closed.

2461
02:06:54.22 --> 02:06:59.82
He looked peaceful, despite the entry wounds in his right shoulder.

2462
02:06:59.82 --> 02:07:05.78
Doc Layton lay on top of him with medical supplies scattered around.

2463
02:07:05.78 --> 02:07:08.78
I rolled him over.

2464
02:07:08.78 --> 02:07:14.78
Doc had taken a three round burst in the right cheek.

2465
02:07:14.78 --> 02:07:19.82
After the right, staff sergeant can't have been, was lying face down, his GPS with a

2466
02:07:19.82 --> 02:07:24.70
busted screen clenched in his left hand.

2467
02:07:24.70 --> 02:07:27.74
His mouth was open and full of dirt.

2468
02:07:27.74 --> 02:07:30.34
I think he was yelling out his grid location.

2469
02:07:30.34 --> 02:07:34.58
The numbers I heard over the radio four hours earlier when he was shot in the back of his

2470
02:07:34.58 --> 02:07:40.22
head.

2471
02:07:40.22 --> 02:07:44.54
The team was wiped out.

2472
02:07:44.54 --> 02:07:45.54
Their bodies were stiff and cold.

2473
02:07:45.54 --> 02:07:46.54
Most of their gear was gone.

2474
02:07:46.54 --> 02:07:49.70
Weapons helmets, radios.

2475
02:07:49.70 --> 02:07:51.98
The 240 machine gun was missing.

2476
02:07:51.98 --> 02:07:58.58
But Lieutenant Johnson's pack was filled with link ammo.

2477
02:07:58.58 --> 02:07:59.54
No one had fired the gun.

2478
02:07:59.54 --> 02:08:07.70
I was supposed to be carrying.

2479
02:08:07.70 --> 02:08:10.78
I had never believed it would end like this.

2480
02:08:10.78 --> 02:08:13.58
My mind refused to accept what I was seeing.

2481
02:08:13.58 --> 02:08:18.10
Our after hour, I had imagined them hold up inside a stone house shielded from RPG,

2482
02:08:18.10 --> 02:08:24.78
blasts exchanging gunfire with a douchemen who were, who knew better than to rush them.

2483
02:08:24.78 --> 02:08:26.66
Swenson was standing above the trench.

2484
02:08:26.66 --> 02:08:31.10
We were taking random incoming and he was watching for movement among houses.

2485
02:08:31.10 --> 02:08:34.70
He talked into his radio for a few seconds and bent down and picked up some of the team's

2486
02:08:34.70 --> 02:08:35.70
gear.

2487
02:08:35.70 --> 02:08:38.42
I say a word.

2488
02:08:38.42 --> 02:08:41.98
He left me alone with them.

2489
02:08:41.98 --> 02:08:45.58
I always did the staff sergeant over my rolled right shoulder.

2490
02:08:45.58 --> 02:08:47.46
He was heavy and I fell once.

2491
02:08:47.46 --> 02:08:49.70
He landed on top of me.

2492
02:08:49.70 --> 02:08:56.38
I got up and carried him to an Afghan truck, carefully talking him into the open bed.

2493
02:08:56.38 --> 02:09:00.90
I stood there for a minute, suddenly beat as I turned away from the truck.

2494
02:09:00.90 --> 02:09:04.30
Half as put his hand on my shoulder.

2495
02:09:04.30 --> 02:09:08.02
The askers say you carried out their dead.

2496
02:09:08.02 --> 02:09:10.38
Now they want to help you.

2497
02:09:10.38 --> 02:09:16.78
Five or six of us returned to the trench while the damn PKM kept shooting at us.

2498
02:09:16.78 --> 02:09:18.70
I carried Tony Johnson back.

2499
02:09:18.70 --> 02:09:22.74
The askers took Lieutenant Johnson and Doc Layton.

2500
02:09:22.74 --> 02:09:26.94
Swenson loved back the rest of the equipment.

2501
02:09:26.94 --> 02:09:30.42
After six hours, it was over.

2502
02:09:30.42 --> 02:09:34.86
And I felt empty as a balloon without air.

2503
02:09:34.86 --> 02:09:37.94
Half as took me aside.

2504
02:09:37.94 --> 02:09:39.10
They've gone to a better place.

2505
02:09:39.10 --> 02:09:41.34
He said, don't cry.

2506
02:09:41.34 --> 02:09:45.14
The askers will take it as weakness.

2507
02:09:45.14 --> 02:09:46.78
No way I was going to cry.

2508
02:09:46.78 --> 02:09:49.54
But at that moment I didn't feel like killing anyone either.

2509
02:09:49.54 --> 02:09:52.26
I wasn't angry or bitter.

2510
02:09:52.26 --> 02:09:55.86
Just deflated and exhausted as though I had run a marathon and couldn't remember why I

2511
02:09:55.86 --> 02:09:57.62
wanted to do it.

2512
02:09:57.62 --> 02:10:01.86
I was too damn tired to stand.

2513
02:10:01.86 --> 02:10:05.74
Still taking fire, we left the valley in a convoy of about four trucks.

2514
02:10:05.74 --> 02:10:10.20
Rod stopped near the casualty collection point where we talked with Captain Kaplan and

2515
02:10:10.20 --> 02:10:14.70
and Corporal Norman who had walked down from their observation posts.

2516
02:10:14.70 --> 02:10:19.50
Staff sergeants Valdez and Miller radio that they were coming down from their perch

2517
02:10:19.50 --> 02:10:20.50
too.

2518
02:10:20.50 --> 02:10:22.54
Everyone was accounted for.

2519
02:10:22.54 --> 02:10:26.34
We had shuddled in and out of the valley five, six or seven times that morning, depending

2520
02:10:26.34 --> 02:10:28.66
on which one of us you asked.

2521
02:10:28.66 --> 02:10:31.66
It was all a fog.

2522
02:10:31.66 --> 02:10:38.66
No senior American officer or pursuit force had come forward from camp, Joyce.

2523
02:10:38.66 --> 02:10:41.78
Captain Swenson said he would try to wrap things up.

2524
02:10:41.78 --> 02:10:48.34
Half as an eye climbed into the back of an afghan truck carrying my dead brothers.

2525
02:10:48.34 --> 02:10:52.22
I held staff sergeant can't afic with my left hand and Lieutenant Johnson rested on

2526
02:10:52.22 --> 02:10:55.30
my right arm.

2527
02:10:55.30 --> 02:11:01.46
As we bounced down the track, we passed villagers returning to Gangegall.

2528
02:11:01.46 --> 02:11:05.82
Some started to laugh, pointing out my dead friends.

2529
02:11:05.82 --> 02:11:08.66
I reached for my rifle.

2530
02:11:08.66 --> 02:11:12.62
Don't half as said holding my arm.

2531
02:11:12.62 --> 02:11:17.50
Not worth it.

2532
02:11:17.50 --> 02:11:22.26
When we arrived back at Camp Joyce, I walked into the battalion aid station to get body

2533
02:11:22.26 --> 02:11:24.18
bags.

2534
02:11:24.18 --> 02:11:27.14
I made your Williams rushed up and clutched at my body armor.

2535
02:11:27.14 --> 02:11:30.78
Tell me they're not all dead, not all of them.

2536
02:11:30.78 --> 02:11:31.78
They're all dead.

2537
02:11:31.78 --> 02:11:35.30
I said removing his hand.

2538
02:11:35.30 --> 02:11:42.18
I walked outside where my friend Sergeant Charles Bokus was waiting.

2539
02:11:42.18 --> 02:11:46.70
Bokus said, I'll give you a hand.

2540
02:11:46.70 --> 02:11:50.74
We walked back to the bodies.

2541
02:11:50.74 --> 02:11:56.22
Sergeant Major Jimmy Carbello, the top and listed men at Joyce, hastened up and put his

2542
02:11:56.22 --> 02:11:58.94
hands firmly on my shoulders trying to steer me away.

2543
02:11:58.94 --> 02:12:01.78
You don't have to do this devil dog.

2544
02:12:01.78 --> 02:12:05.42
My guys will make sure it's done right.

2545
02:12:05.42 --> 02:12:07.54
That wasn't how to end it.

2546
02:12:07.54 --> 02:12:11.34
If I had died, I'd want Lieutenant Johnson and Staff Sergeant can't affect to put me in

2547
02:12:11.34 --> 02:12:12.34
the bag.

2548
02:12:12.34 --> 02:12:13.18
I'll finish it.

2549
02:12:13.18 --> 02:12:16.42
I said.

2550
02:12:16.42 --> 02:12:25.70
Bokus and I carried the bodies back to the freezers, take off their battle gear and dig through

2551
02:12:25.70 --> 02:12:29.86
their pockets, marking items for shipment to their families.

2552
02:12:29.86 --> 02:12:35.54
I take a Chevron from Staff Sergeant Kenneth Fick and Attach it to my dog tags.

2553
02:12:35.54 --> 02:12:49.50
We had started out not liking each other a thousand years ago.

2554
02:12:49.50 --> 02:12:52.78
We cleaned them up as best we can.

2555
02:12:52.78 --> 02:12:57.02
Wiping the blood and dirt off their faces, taking off their field gear, straightening

2556
02:12:57.02 --> 02:13:05.06
out their camouflage uniforms and placing each in a black body bag.

2557
02:13:05.06 --> 02:13:16.58
We marked the name at the head, draping American flag over each bag, bow our heads in prayer,

2558
02:13:16.58 --> 02:13:27.38
and drive them out to the Heelow Bat.

2559
02:13:27.38 --> 02:13:35.02
Gone to go was one of the deadliest small arms battles of the Afghanistan war.

2560
02:13:35.02 --> 02:13:42.10
We lost five advisors in addition to T Monti, Army Sergeant first class Westbrook had died

2561
02:13:42.10 --> 02:13:44.38
of his wounds.

2562
02:13:44.38 --> 02:13:51.22
Eight aspires were killed in 13 series, they wounded by rifle machine gun and RPG fire.

2563
02:13:51.22 --> 02:13:54.82
Enemy losses to small arms were probably a similar number.

2564
02:13:54.82 --> 02:14:00.98
There were no IDs, no bombs, and very few artillery shells.

2565
02:14:00.98 --> 02:14:05.82
All its caused most of the casualties, Gange Gahl was a mountain fight from an earlier

2566
02:14:05.82 --> 02:14:14.82
century.

2567
02:14:14.82 --> 02:14:42.70
And it's a fight from an earlier century, but uh...

2568
02:14:42.70 --> 02:14:45.70
That's something's don't change.

2569
02:14:45.70 --> 02:14:52.94
That's a fact.

2570
02:14:52.94 --> 02:14:54.70
Yeah it was a...

2571
02:14:54.70 --> 02:14:58.70
God.

2572
02:14:58.70 --> 02:15:03.90
You know I say it and I don't think people understand it, but you know I might not physically

2573
02:15:03.90 --> 02:15:09.22
die that day, but I died.

2574
02:15:09.22 --> 02:15:10.74
Right there next to them.

2575
02:15:10.74 --> 02:15:18.18
I mean you talk about, you know.

2576
02:15:18.18 --> 02:15:28.10
I mean it's one thing to lose one person, but everybody, I mean it's...

2577
02:15:28.10 --> 02:15:34.50
I mean, that's the worst case scenario.

2578
02:15:34.50 --> 02:15:35.50
You're living it.

2579
02:15:35.50 --> 02:15:37.94
You know I mean you're literally...

2580
02:15:37.94 --> 02:15:44.94
You don't even have anybody from your own team to put your dead on the bird.

2581
02:15:44.94 --> 02:15:45.94
You know.

2582
02:15:45.94 --> 02:15:49.10
And you know.

2583
02:15:49.10 --> 02:15:51.34
How old are you at this point?

2584
02:15:51.34 --> 02:15:53.34
21.

2585
02:15:53.34 --> 02:15:54.82
21 years old.

2586
02:15:54.82 --> 02:15:57.18
21.

2587
02:15:57.18 --> 02:15:57.38
21.

2588
02:15:57.38 --> 02:16:05.58
You know I don't know if it talks about it in the book, you know.

2589
02:16:05.58 --> 02:16:09.02
I tried to get that with my teammates.

2590
02:16:09.02 --> 02:16:11.94
I went straight from there and I went to...

2591
02:16:11.94 --> 02:16:15.14
So the afghan side.

2592
02:16:15.14 --> 02:16:19.14
And I did it with all their guys too.

2593
02:16:19.14 --> 02:16:24.14
And usually what they do with their guys is they just call the families and they got

2594
02:16:24.14 --> 02:16:26.54
so many days to come and get them.

2595
02:16:26.54 --> 02:16:27.74
And I wasn't allowed that.

2596
02:16:27.74 --> 02:16:31.42
I went back and I took body bags up there and we gave them the exact same respect

2597
02:16:31.42 --> 02:16:33.14
that we gave my guys.

2598
02:16:33.14 --> 02:16:37.06
We put them into freezers until our family's came and got them.

2599
02:16:37.06 --> 02:16:40.30
And you know I didn't go...

2600
02:16:40.30 --> 02:16:47.38
I didn't go start worrying about my stuff until we take care of all the guys, you know.

2601
02:16:47.38 --> 02:16:49.38
And it's just...

2602
02:16:49.38 --> 02:16:50.38
It's...

2603
02:16:50.38 --> 02:16:52.38
It's a long day.

2604
02:16:52.38 --> 02:16:57.54
It's a long day.

2605
02:16:57.54 --> 02:17:04.82
And I mean...

2606
02:17:04.82 --> 02:17:09.06
You're just like okay.

2607
02:17:09.06 --> 02:17:11.26
You still have a job to do.

2608
02:17:11.26 --> 02:17:16.30
Yeah, so I don't know if it talks about it in there but they tried to put me on the helicopter

2609
02:17:16.30 --> 02:17:22.98
with them to go back to a bargroom and then wanted me to fly home to do the ramp ceremony

2610
02:17:22.98 --> 02:17:28.42
and wanted me to fly home with them.

2611
02:17:28.42 --> 02:17:34.38
And I actually put them on there and I told them I would be right back and I knew those

2612
02:17:34.38 --> 02:17:36.14
birds had to take off the same words.

2613
02:17:36.14 --> 02:17:39.30
The PJ's weren't going to sit on the fly line very long.

2614
02:17:39.30 --> 02:17:43.38
And I just made sure that I knew that they took off before I got around anybody else

2615
02:17:43.38 --> 02:17:45.98
because I mean they were dead.

2616
02:17:45.98 --> 02:17:50.30
I mean I still had guys that still needed me.

2617
02:17:50.30 --> 02:17:53.54
And they didn't need me anymore.

2618
02:17:53.54 --> 02:17:59.74
And so I knew my Afghan soldiers needed me.

2619
02:17:59.74 --> 02:18:01.94
They needed to see that they weren't alone.

2620
02:18:01.94 --> 02:18:05.38
They needed to see that we're in this together.

2621
02:18:05.38 --> 02:18:09.06
And that was what mattered to me.

2622
02:18:09.06 --> 02:18:12.70
But the guys I still had lives.

2623
02:18:12.70 --> 02:18:20.22
How did the Afghan year afghan soldiers respond to this whole situation?

2624
02:18:20.22 --> 02:18:25.02
Sometimes in Iraq there'd be a mass casualty like this and we'd lose a whole.

2625
02:18:25.02 --> 02:18:26.02
There was actually a nirmati.

2626
02:18:26.02 --> 02:18:28.14
We lost a whole battalion.

2627
02:18:28.14 --> 02:18:29.14
They all left.

2628
02:18:29.14 --> 02:18:30.14
Yeah they quit.

2629
02:18:30.14 --> 02:18:31.14
Yeah.

2630
02:18:31.14 --> 02:18:32.78
Where were your guys?

2631
02:18:32.78 --> 02:18:34.78
How did they infect them?

2632
02:18:34.78 --> 02:18:38.82
I mean they stuck it out.

2633
02:18:38.82 --> 02:18:44.22
They stuck it out.

2634
02:18:44.22 --> 02:18:45.22
They did.

2635
02:18:45.22 --> 02:18:48.86
I mean I'm telling you they are some of the most incredible human beings I've ever seen.

2636
02:18:48.86 --> 02:18:50.86
You know we come in and deploy.

2637
02:18:50.86 --> 02:18:53.86
Were there for a certain amount of time they lived forever.

2638
02:18:53.86 --> 02:18:55.86
And they responded.

2639
02:18:55.86 --> 02:19:00.86
I mean they got their shit together.

2640
02:19:00.86 --> 02:19:07.06
And we were back in the fight three days later.

2641
02:19:07.06 --> 02:19:08.78
And they don't get to respond.

2642
02:19:08.78 --> 02:19:11.26
They don't get to support we do.

2643
02:19:11.26 --> 02:19:15.86
They don't get anything we get.

2644
02:19:15.86 --> 02:19:23.70
And it's just you know but we stuck together you know they help me they help me get through it.

2645
02:19:23.70 --> 02:19:27.86
And I hope I helped them but I think the most incredible thing was it was at that point

2646
02:19:27.86 --> 02:19:33.86
that they brought me into their I was accepted as one of them.

2647
02:19:33.86 --> 02:19:38.26
And that was probably the most rewarding piece of it to me you know.

2648
02:19:38.26 --> 02:19:43.86
Was it I I had finally proven myself to them that that I was one of them.

2649
02:19:43.86 --> 02:19:50.86
And the point was an over yet.

2650
02:19:50.86 --> 02:19:57.86
And you know there was more fighting to be done.

2651
02:19:57.86 --> 02:20:02.86
Going back to the book army and army convoy had been ambushed north of Monti.

2652
02:20:02.86 --> 02:20:07.86
Lieutenant current captain Brian the company commander were on their way to assist.

2653
02:20:07.86 --> 02:20:11.86
I looked to Colonel you who knotted an agreement minutes later.

2654
02:20:11.86 --> 02:20:16.86
And the boss staff sergeant Richards and some of the Colonel's guys that came with him.

2655
02:20:16.86 --> 02:20:18.86
A dozen ass cars.

2656
02:20:18.86 --> 02:20:24.86
And I were headed out the gate.

2657
02:20:24.86 --> 02:20:29.86
Basically what you run into is there's a huge kind of what somebody hit an IED.

2658
02:20:29.86 --> 02:20:31.86
Is that what it happened to us?

2659
02:20:31.86 --> 02:20:32.86
They ambushed.

2660
02:20:32.86 --> 02:20:33.86
And they ambushed.

2661
02:20:33.86 --> 02:20:36.86
And they blew the Django trucks up and blocked the road.

2662
02:20:36.86 --> 02:20:43.86
They intertwined those Django trucks in between the US convoy and it's so stupid.

2663
02:20:43.86 --> 02:20:46.86
And so the Django truck is blown up and it's blocking the road.

2664
02:20:46.86 --> 02:20:48.86
So guess what happens to the rest of them?

2665
02:20:48.86 --> 02:20:49.86
They're all certain.

2666
02:20:49.86 --> 02:20:55.86
And you can't go around it because it's about a 250 foot drop off into the Kuhnara river on the side.

2667
02:20:55.86 --> 02:21:01.86
So they're stuck on the side of this and I've been listening to it on the radio for a long time.

2668
02:21:01.86 --> 02:21:03.86
And I knew they were going to get slaughtered.

2669
02:21:03.86 --> 02:21:07.86
You weren't just going to sit there and they had buttoned up.

2670
02:21:07.86 --> 02:21:08.86
So that's what you were talking about earlier.

2671
02:21:08.86 --> 02:21:09.86
You buttoned up and you wait.

2672
02:21:09.86 --> 02:21:11.86
Well now they're going to maneuver on the road.

2673
02:21:11.86 --> 02:21:11.86
Yep.

2674
02:21:11.86 --> 02:21:12.86
And that's what they were doing.

2675
02:21:12.86 --> 02:21:13.86
And that's what they were doing.

2676
02:21:13.86 --> 02:21:16.86
So the guys in the Django trucks had jumped out.

2677
02:21:16.86 --> 02:21:19.86
And I kept asking over the radio.

2678
02:21:19.86 --> 02:21:21.86
You know, I could monitor.

2679
02:21:21.86 --> 02:21:22.86
And I kept asking over the radio.

2680
02:21:22.86 --> 02:21:24.86
And I could see the smoke from where I was at.

2681
02:21:24.86 --> 02:21:27.86
And I kept asking over the radio as a clip platoon.

2682
02:21:27.86 --> 02:21:29.86
And I kept combat logistics platoon.

2683
02:21:29.86 --> 02:21:31.86
And I kept asking over the radio.

2684
02:21:31.86 --> 02:21:32.86
How many rounds have you fired?

2685
02:21:32.86 --> 02:21:34.86
Because I was afraid they're going to get low and ammo.

2686
02:21:34.86 --> 02:21:36.86
Zero.

2687
02:21:36.86 --> 02:21:38.86
Damn.

2688
02:21:38.86 --> 02:21:42.86
So that's when you roll out.

2689
02:21:42.86 --> 02:21:44.86
You get out there.

2690
02:21:44.86 --> 02:21:46.86
And this is three days after, again, you go.

2691
02:21:46.86 --> 02:21:48.86
Damn.

2692
02:21:48.86 --> 02:21:53.86
PKMs and AKs were hammering down on this mess with little return fire.

2693
02:21:53.86 --> 02:21:56.86
It'd be crazy to drive into that tangle of vehicles.

2694
02:21:56.86 --> 02:21:57.86
Is it bocus or bocus?

2695
02:21:57.86 --> 02:21:58.86
Socus.

2696
02:21:58.86 --> 02:22:03.86
Bocus was on the mark 19 on our truck. He couldn't shoot because the angle's a fire.

2697
02:22:03.86 --> 02:22:06.86
Richard stayed in the driver's seat while I advanced on foot.

2698
02:22:06.86 --> 02:22:08.86
By bounds into the wreckage.

2699
02:22:08.86 --> 02:22:10.86
Our ass cars run ran forward with us.

2700
02:22:10.86 --> 02:22:14.86
But their light M16s didn't impress the Taliban machine gun crew.

2701
02:22:14.86 --> 02:22:16.86
I was quickly pinned behind us disabled truck.

2702
02:22:16.86 --> 02:22:17.86
Looking up.

2703
02:22:17.86 --> 02:22:21.86
I could see the PKM was shooting from a thick stone house 200 meters up slope.

2704
02:22:21.86 --> 02:22:23.86
I executed to have a target.

2705
02:22:23.86 --> 02:22:25.86
I excited to have a target so close.

2706
02:22:25.86 --> 02:22:29.86
I fired about five shells from my grenade launcher before my common sense kicked in.

2707
02:22:29.86 --> 02:22:30.86
What am I doing?

2708
02:22:30.86 --> 02:22:32.86
I thought I'm outmatched by a machine gun.

2709
02:22:32.86 --> 02:22:33.86
But there's an army.

2710
02:22:33.86 --> 02:22:37.86
Humvee sitting next to me with no one in the 50 calter it.

2711
02:22:37.86 --> 02:22:38.86
You run over there.

2712
02:22:38.86 --> 02:22:39.86
Man, you're 50 cala yelled.

2713
02:22:39.86 --> 02:22:41.86
Where logistics came the muffled reply.

2714
02:22:41.86 --> 02:22:42.86
We don't fight.

2715
02:22:42.86 --> 02:22:45.86
Some supply guys can't wait to get into the action.

2716
02:22:45.86 --> 02:22:46.86
But not this gang.

2717
02:22:46.86 --> 02:22:47.86
I wasn't worried though.

2718
02:22:47.86 --> 02:22:51.86
Wild man, crew would soon have air on station.

2719
02:22:51.86 --> 02:22:56.86
The bodies were scattered all over the road all civilian's line face down next.

2720
02:22:56.86 --> 02:23:00.86
To me alongside the army truck was a skinny teenager and a t-shirt bleeding from

2721
02:23:00.86 --> 02:23:02.86
Shrapnel, his chest and his left arm.

2722
02:23:02.86 --> 02:23:06.86
He was a pathetic sight sprawled on his back and his filthy brown shorts.

2723
02:23:06.86 --> 02:23:11.86
An orange tip needle protruding from above his heart and a plastic stopper shoved above his

2724
02:23:11.86 --> 02:23:12.86
left nostril.

2725
02:23:12.86 --> 02:23:14.86
He didn't weigh as much as I ate in a day.

2726
02:23:14.86 --> 02:23:19.86
His hands and feet were uglier than the dirt from his efforts to crawl out of the line of fire.

2727
02:23:19.86 --> 02:23:23.86
He wasn't old enough to grow a beard but he had a full shock of black hair.

2728
02:23:23.86 --> 02:23:25.86
Not a bad looking kid.

2729
02:23:25.86 --> 02:23:29.86
Once he was cleaned up at the aid station and had some ice cream he'd be okay.

2730
02:23:29.86 --> 02:23:30.86
I felt good.

2731
02:23:30.86 --> 02:23:32.86
In fact, I was pumped.

2732
02:23:32.86 --> 02:23:36.86
I'd applied dozens of turnicits but this was the first time I had to smell death hiss out.

2733
02:23:36.86 --> 02:23:38.86
And that's because you needled him down.

2734
02:23:38.86 --> 02:23:39.86
And I didn't cover that part.

2735
02:23:39.86 --> 02:23:43.86
You had a sucking chest wound and you gave him a decompression.

2736
02:23:43.86 --> 02:23:46.86
I had saved a human being.

2737
02:23:46.86 --> 02:23:52.86
A poor, scrawny kid, eaking out a living by driving a banged-up truck past known ambush sites.

2738
02:23:52.86 --> 02:23:56.86
What he eventually joined the Taliban and betray an American convoy?

2739
02:23:56.86 --> 02:23:58.86
I had no idea.

2740
02:23:58.86 --> 02:24:03.86
Sure, some of the villagers at Gangegall had been real prex but why should I hold it against this kid?

2741
02:24:03.86 --> 02:24:08.86
I ran back down the road, hoisted up another wounded truck driver and carried him back.

2742
02:24:08.86 --> 02:24:10.86
Then I stopped to check on the skinny kid.

2743
02:24:10.86 --> 02:24:15.86
I wanted to pat him on the shoulder to make myself feel good for my supposedly wonderful deed.

2744
02:24:15.86 --> 02:24:18.86
Only he was dead.

2745
02:24:18.86 --> 02:24:21.86
He had blood to death from the wound to his left arm.

2746
02:24:21.86 --> 02:24:27.86
The crew in the army truck had led him bleed out, not five feet away because he was an Afghan and they were afraid.

2747
02:24:27.86 --> 02:24:30.86
Damn it.

2748
02:24:30.86 --> 02:24:34.86
The Afghan drivers were all huddered together in a ditch by the river.

2749
02:24:34.86 --> 02:24:37.86
The ambush had been sprung about 90 minutes earlier.

2750
02:24:37.86 --> 02:24:40.86
By now they had pissed themselves of a dry and had nowhere to go.

2751
02:24:40.86 --> 02:24:46.86
I banged my rifle on, I banged my rifle butt on an army truck, yelling to the soldiers to open up.

2752
02:24:46.86 --> 02:24:50.86
At least give me some water for those poor bastards I shouted.

2753
02:24:50.86 --> 02:24:56.86
A sheep is medic, got out of the truck with several bottles of water, and his med pack and ran over the ditch.

2754
02:24:56.86 --> 02:25:01.86
I knelt there looking at the bloodstained stains from the kid right beside the truck door.

2755
02:25:01.86 --> 02:25:04.86
I banged on the steel door again.

2756
02:25:04.86 --> 02:25:06.86
It opened a crack.

2757
02:25:06.86 --> 02:25:11.86
The guy who I said to the captain inside.

2758
02:25:11.86 --> 02:25:21.86
As the traffic jam was sorted out, Colonel UNI walked back to our home, the dead keep kid lay on the hood,

2759
02:25:21.86 --> 02:25:26.86
and rather than ride to base with a corpse between us, we wedge the body in the trunk.

2760
02:25:26.86 --> 02:25:31.86
Sometimes you laugh, sometimes you want to cry.

2761
02:25:31.86 --> 02:25:35.86
Before dropping a shell down a mortar tube,

2762
02:25:35.86 --> 02:25:38.86
the gunner levels the bubbles on his sight.

2763
02:25:38.86 --> 02:25:43.86
If he loses the bubbles, then the tube is pointed at a crazy ankle.

2764
02:25:43.86 --> 02:25:50.86
After gonging a gall, I was losing the bubble.

2765
02:25:50.86 --> 02:25:54.86
So investigations take place.

2766
02:25:54.86 --> 02:25:58.86
There's accusations and excuses.

2767
02:25:58.86 --> 02:26:04.86
One of the terms that was in there that was being said that there was poor battle management.

2768
02:26:04.86 --> 02:26:09.86
And you're talking to a psychologist on site at this time.

2769
02:26:09.86 --> 02:26:16.86
And you know, that's some of the support you were talking about that we might have that an Afghan kid in the Afghan army might not have.

2770
02:26:16.86 --> 02:26:17.86
And it was a feat.

2771
02:26:17.86 --> 02:26:21.86
Was it a female captain, Katie Cobb?

2772
02:26:21.86 --> 02:26:26.86
And she was making some assessments back to the book.

2773
02:26:26.86 --> 02:26:28.86
It's true I didn't feel connected with others.

2774
02:26:28.86 --> 02:26:33.86
The Oscars were smoking hash, jabbering on their cell phones and wandering around in flipflops.

2775
02:26:33.86 --> 02:26:38.86
The American soldiers were playing video games, stuffing themselves at dinner and laughing too loudly at nothing.

2776
02:26:38.86 --> 02:26:39.86
We weren't fighting a war.

2777
02:26:39.86 --> 02:26:45.86
We were holding a few acres of dirt while the war swirled around outside our barbed wire.

2778
02:26:45.86 --> 02:26:47.86
There were douchemen in every valley.

2779
02:26:47.86 --> 02:26:50.86
Drink tea with the villagers, pay $40 for a chicken.

2780
02:26:50.86 --> 02:26:52.86
We were in Kumar to fight.

2781
02:26:52.86 --> 02:26:54.86
Let's get it on.

2782
02:26:54.86 --> 02:26:55.86
That was my attitude.

2783
02:26:55.86 --> 02:26:59.86
The psychologist insisted that I go back to the states for treatment.

2784
02:26:59.86 --> 02:27:00.86
No thanks.

2785
02:27:00.86 --> 02:27:05.86
As a captain, she had the rank to make a recommendation stick, but she wanted my agreement.

2786
02:27:05.86 --> 02:27:07.86
So she challenged me.

2787
02:27:07.86 --> 02:27:09.86
We would play a game of ping pong.

2788
02:27:09.86 --> 02:27:11.86
If I won, I could stay.

2789
02:27:11.86 --> 02:27:14.86
I lost by one point.

2790
02:27:14.86 --> 02:27:16.86
She was very good.

2791
02:27:16.86 --> 02:27:19.86
And she really was worried about me and cared about me.

2792
02:27:19.86 --> 02:27:21.86
I knew that.

2793
02:27:21.86 --> 02:27:24.86
It was my time to go home.

2794
02:27:26.86 --> 02:27:28.86
A ping pong game?

2795
02:27:28.86 --> 02:27:29.86
Was she like a legit ping pong player?

2796
02:27:29.86 --> 02:27:32.86
No, I thought I had her.

2797
02:27:32.86 --> 02:27:35.86
You know, I was either.

2798
02:27:35.86 --> 02:27:38.86
You know, I...

2799
02:27:38.86 --> 02:27:41.86
It was probably best I went home.

2800
02:27:41.86 --> 02:27:46.86
I would say if it wasn't...

2801
02:27:46.86 --> 02:27:50.86
If I didn't go home, I would have never came home.

2802
02:27:50.86 --> 02:27:55.86
You know, I was just getting well on tighter.

2803
02:27:55.86 --> 02:28:00.86
I mean, I was...

2804
02:28:00.86 --> 02:28:02.86
You couldn't tell me.

2805
02:28:02.86 --> 02:28:04.86
You couldn't tell me.

2806
02:28:04.86 --> 02:28:06.86
I wasn't...

2807
02:28:06.86 --> 02:28:07.86
I wasn't command.

2808
02:28:07.86 --> 02:28:09.86
You couldn't tell me what to do?

2809
02:28:09.86 --> 02:28:10.86
You were out of control.

2810
02:28:10.86 --> 02:28:11.86
I was...

2811
02:28:11.86 --> 02:28:12.86
I was out of control.

2812
02:28:12.86 --> 02:28:13.86
Yeah.

2813
02:28:13.86 --> 02:28:15.86
I mean, I wasn't doing anything.

2814
02:28:15.86 --> 02:28:18.86
Nothing, you know, it morally unethical, right?

2815
02:28:18.86 --> 02:28:20.86
Nothing I was doing my job.

2816
02:28:20.86 --> 02:28:24.86
As far as like, commanding me, you couldn't...

2817
02:28:24.86 --> 02:28:26.86
You were going to do what you were going to do.

2818
02:28:26.86 --> 02:28:27.86
Yeah, absolutely.

2819
02:28:27.86 --> 02:28:31.86
I mean, I was at the point to where I had no...

2820
02:28:31.86 --> 02:28:33.86
I had no...

2821
02:28:33.86 --> 02:28:35.86
I didn't trust my command.

2822
02:28:35.86 --> 02:28:36.86
I didn't trust anybody.

2823
02:28:36.86 --> 02:28:38.86
I mean, it was...

2824
02:28:38.86 --> 02:28:39.86
I was a...

2825
02:28:39.86 --> 02:28:40.86
You know, not a one man.

2826
02:28:40.86 --> 02:28:42.86
I was a three-man operation, right?

2827
02:28:42.86 --> 02:28:43.86
I mean, I was a...

2828
02:28:43.86 --> 02:28:45.86
But I was a one-man record group, right?

2829
02:28:45.86 --> 02:28:46.86
Like I was...

2830
02:28:46.86 --> 02:28:48.86
I mean, I was going to do...

2831
02:28:48.86 --> 02:28:50.86
You weren't going to tell me anything.

2832
02:28:50.86 --> 02:28:51.86
I mean, there was...

2833
02:28:51.86 --> 02:28:52.86
It was pretty bad.

2834
02:28:52.86 --> 02:28:53.86
I mean, I was fighting.

2835
02:28:53.86 --> 02:28:55.86
You know, the first fight...

2836
02:28:55.86 --> 02:28:56.86
You know...

2837
02:28:56.86 --> 02:29:02.86
How much longer was it that you actually lost the ping pong match and got sent home?

2838
02:29:02.86 --> 02:29:03.86
I lost it, right?

2839
02:29:03.86 --> 02:29:05.86
A couple days before Thanksgiving.

2840
02:29:05.86 --> 02:29:06.86
Okay.

2841
02:29:06.86 --> 02:29:08.86
So it was like you were there for another...

2842
02:29:08.86 --> 02:29:09.86
What's Thanksgiving now?

2843
02:29:09.86 --> 02:29:10.86
And...

2844
02:29:10.86 --> 02:29:11.86
Yeah, it's in the...

2845
02:29:11.86 --> 02:29:12.86
And we fought our ass off.

2846
02:29:12.86 --> 02:29:13.86
That whole time.

2847
02:29:13.86 --> 02:29:14.86
The whole time.

2848
02:29:14.86 --> 02:29:15.86
It was...

2849
02:29:15.86 --> 02:29:16.86
It was...

2850
02:29:16.86 --> 02:29:17.86
We fought.

2851
02:29:17.86 --> 02:29:18.86
Her ass is off.

2852
02:29:18.86 --> 02:29:20.86
Almost every single day.

2853
02:29:20.86 --> 02:29:21.86
And sometimes...

2854
02:29:21.86 --> 02:29:23.86
Three and four times a day.

2855
02:29:23.86 --> 02:29:26.86
Well, that momentum that you talked about in the Valley...

2856
02:29:26.86 --> 02:29:27.86
They built it.

2857
02:29:27.86 --> 02:29:28.86
It keeps coming, right?

2858
02:29:28.86 --> 02:29:31.86
It keeps coming because right after that, they overrun, Keating.

2859
02:29:31.86 --> 02:29:32.86
Right after...

2860
02:29:32.86 --> 02:29:33.86
I mean, it's all that...

2861
02:29:33.86 --> 02:29:36.86
All of it, you know, they just built so much momentum.

2862
02:29:36.86 --> 02:29:37.86
I mean, they were hammering us.

2863
02:29:37.86 --> 02:29:39.86
I mean, hammering us every day.

2864
02:29:39.86 --> 02:29:41.86
And...

2865
02:29:41.86 --> 02:29:43.86
You know, it was...

2866
02:29:43.86 --> 02:29:45.86
It was pretty bad.

2867
02:29:47.86 --> 02:29:48.86
So you get sent home.

2868
02:29:48.86 --> 02:29:49.86
Here we go back to the book.

2869
02:29:49.86 --> 02:29:52.86
When I got home in December, I felt like I landed on the moon.

2870
02:29:52.86 --> 02:29:57.86
Everyone around me was excited about football, Christmas, and other normal things.

2871
02:29:57.86 --> 02:30:00.86
I was looking at the clapboard houses and the cars thinking,

2872
02:30:00.86 --> 02:30:02.86
Man, that's so flimsy.

2873
02:30:02.86 --> 02:30:05.86
They wouldn't give cover worth shit in a firefight.

2874
02:30:05.86 --> 02:30:07.86
It was an exposed feeling.

2875
02:30:07.86 --> 02:30:09.86
And where were my machine guns?

2876
02:30:09.86 --> 02:30:12.86
I found my old pistol and kept it around like a rabbit's foot.

2877
02:30:12.86 --> 02:30:15.86
But I missed my 240s and my 50 calves something awful.

2878
02:30:15.86 --> 02:30:18.86
It seems weird, I'm sure.

2879
02:30:18.86 --> 02:30:24.86
But I really just wasn't buying that there wasn't some enemy about to come over the green hills.

2880
02:30:24.86 --> 02:30:26.86
And I felt so unprepared.

2881
02:30:26.86 --> 02:30:29.86
I wouldn't be able any good to protect anybody.

2882
02:30:29.86 --> 02:30:33.86
I was soon sent off to Fort Thomas, Kentucky, for PTSD therapy.

2883
02:30:33.86 --> 02:30:39.86
Maybe that would settle me down and let me get some sleep and stop feeling so depressed and angry at every little thing.

2884
02:30:39.86 --> 02:30:42.86
Some guys really go nuts when they come back.

2885
02:30:42.86 --> 02:30:47.86
And I wasn't in danger of that, but I could feel the kind of crazy things that maybe got the better of them.

2886
02:30:47.86 --> 02:30:57.86
You're over there long enough and under such constant battle stress that it resets all your settings the way way into the red.

2887
02:30:57.86 --> 02:30:59.86
And they're very hard to set back.

2888
02:30:59.86 --> 02:31:05.86
The main thing knowing was that I didn't get my friends out as I had promised.

2889
02:31:08.86 --> 02:31:15.86
I'd spent a good part of my 21 years being pretty critical of other people who failed at their responsibilities.

2890
02:31:15.86 --> 02:31:20.86
And now it was all coming back on me in a big dump truck.

2891
02:31:30.86 --> 02:31:36.86
Every day the psychologist urged us to step back and identify why we were experiencing negative emotions.

2892
02:31:36.86 --> 02:31:41.86
In other words, take a minute to really be conscious of the emotion instead of just letting it seep in.

2893
02:31:41.86 --> 02:31:45.86
Don't let your mind stay in neutral watch your thoughts.

2894
02:31:45.86 --> 02:31:54.86
And by the way, I'm hitting this stuff pretty hard because a lot of people that listen to this podcast are thinking these things right here.

2895
02:31:54.86 --> 02:31:56.86
But I think that's an important part.

2896
02:31:56.86 --> 02:31:59.86
Don't let your mind stay in neutral watch your thoughts.

2897
02:31:59.86 --> 02:32:04.86
Refusing to get out of bed or go to work or smile to others are all decisions.

2898
02:32:04.86 --> 02:32:09.86
Find the reasons those decisions and turn negative feelings into positive actions.

2899
02:32:09.86 --> 02:32:11.86
It's not enough to identify why you're feeling bad.

2900
02:32:11.86 --> 02:32:15.86
It's about having the character to do something positive to take up that space.

2901
02:32:15.86 --> 02:32:18.86
Don't wallow in your misery, which is just selfish.

2902
02:32:18.86 --> 02:32:20.86
Childish self-absorption.

2903
02:32:20.86 --> 02:32:22.86
It was all good stuff.

2904
02:32:22.86 --> 02:32:25.86
All I ever need is a good operating manual.

2905
02:32:25.86 --> 02:32:27.86
So are you getting some good instructions?

2906
02:32:27.86 --> 02:32:28.86
Yeah.

2907
02:32:28.86 --> 02:32:29.86
No, it was.

2908
02:32:29.86 --> 02:32:32.86
You know, I can't say that the PTSD center helped me,

2909
02:32:32.86 --> 02:32:34.86
but what it did is it educated me.

2910
02:32:34.86 --> 02:32:38.86
It educated me on why I was feeling the way I was.

2911
02:32:38.86 --> 02:32:40.86
And what it was.

2912
02:32:40.86 --> 02:32:44.86
And then therefore that helped me deal with it, right?

2913
02:32:44.86 --> 02:32:52.86
It kind of like, you know, you know, kind of like how you know you're a diet that works for you.

2914
02:32:52.86 --> 02:32:57.86
You know, like you can look in the mirror, how you feel after you eat it, right?

2915
02:32:57.86 --> 02:32:58.86
It's kind of the same thing.

2916
02:32:58.86 --> 02:33:04.86
Like it educates you on why your body's doing this or why you're having this reaction.

2917
02:33:04.86 --> 02:33:08.86
And you know, and that it's normal and it's just, you know, and this is why it's doing it.

2918
02:33:08.86 --> 02:33:10.86
And this is how you help counter it, right?

2919
02:33:10.86 --> 02:33:14.86
And that was kind of, that was kind of what it did for me.

2920
02:33:14.86 --> 02:33:18.86
It didn't, I don't think it really, it didn't, it didn't fix anything.

2921
02:33:18.86 --> 02:33:20.86
It just educated me on what the problem was.

2922
02:33:20.86 --> 02:33:22.86
So you could start to identify the problem.

2923
02:33:22.86 --> 02:33:24.86
Yes, so I could identify the problem.

2924
02:33:24.86 --> 02:33:27.86
I could identify why I was feeling this way.

2925
02:33:27.86 --> 02:33:31.86
And then, you know, I could make decisions based of how I could,

2926
02:33:31.86 --> 02:33:35.86
when you look at the root of that problem, was it that feeling of like, hey,

2927
02:33:35.86 --> 02:33:38.86
the promise that you made was I'll get you guys out.

2928
02:33:38.86 --> 02:33:41.86
I mean, no, I mean, the facts of the facts are like here's,

2929
02:33:41.86 --> 02:33:44.86
here's, I get so frustrated with people who want to like,

2930
02:33:44.86 --> 02:33:47.86
like, I'm a factual guy, like, you know, I mean, I,

2931
02:33:47.86 --> 02:33:49.86
I'm, everything to me is black and white.

2932
02:33:49.86 --> 02:33:54.86
And I'm, I'm a fact based like I, I went in that day to go get my teammates out.

2933
02:33:54.86 --> 02:33:57.86
I failed.

2934
02:33:57.86 --> 02:34:00.86
I failed. There's no, you can't jump around.

2935
02:34:00.86 --> 02:34:03.86
You can't ignore the facts of what happened. I failed.

2936
02:34:03.86 --> 02:34:08.86
I failed miserably.

2937
02:34:08.86 --> 02:34:14.86
And so, you know, if you, if I tell myself, I didn't fail,

2938
02:34:14.86 --> 02:34:17.86
I lie in line with myself.

2939
02:34:17.86 --> 02:34:22.86
So for me, you know, I failed.

2940
02:34:22.86 --> 02:34:25.86
I was tested and I failed.

2941
02:34:25.86 --> 02:34:29.86
And now I have to figure out what to do with that.

2942
02:34:29.86 --> 02:34:32.86
And that's part of it.

2943
02:34:32.86 --> 02:34:36.86
You know, and that's why I get so upset about like, you know,

2944
02:34:36.86 --> 02:34:38.86
the counselors or whatever, right?

2945
02:34:38.86 --> 02:34:39.86
No, well, you didn't fail. No, no, no, no.

2946
02:34:39.86 --> 02:34:43.86
Like, as soon as they say that to me, I'm done.

2947
02:34:43.86 --> 02:34:46.86
I'm done, because no, that's, I'm not going to lie to myself.

2948
02:34:46.86 --> 02:34:49.86
I failed and now I need to deal with it.

2949
02:34:49.86 --> 02:34:52.86
I need to deal with it.

2950
02:34:52.86 --> 02:34:55.86
You know, I can't lie.

2951
02:34:55.86 --> 02:35:01.86
And that's, and I mean, look, I mean, it's, I always say the equivalent

2952
02:35:01.86 --> 02:35:05.86
to try to make people understand like how, how I feel about it

2953
02:35:05.86 --> 02:35:11.86
and the situation is, it would be like, you inside of a house

2954
02:35:11.86 --> 02:35:13.86
and your family's there.

2955
02:35:13.86 --> 02:35:16.86
And the house catches on fire.

2956
02:35:16.86 --> 02:35:21.86
And you end up getting out, thinking that maybe they're all out.

2957
02:35:21.86 --> 02:35:26.86
And you can't get back in there and they all burn the dust.

2958
02:35:26.86 --> 02:35:29.86
That's kind of the equivalent of it.

2959
02:35:29.86 --> 02:35:32.86
And, you know, so I just have to deal with it.

2960
02:35:32.86 --> 02:35:36.86
And, you know, I deal with the best I can every day.

2961
02:35:36.86 --> 02:35:38.86
I, I learned from it.

2962
02:35:38.86 --> 02:35:41.86
I try to turn it into something good.

2963
02:35:41.86 --> 02:35:44.86
But at the end of the day, I still failed.

2964
02:35:44.86 --> 02:35:50.86
And, you know, that's, that's the way it goes.

2965
02:35:50.86 --> 02:36:00.86
And, you know, that's the way it goes.

2966
02:36:00.86 --> 02:36:04.86
Going back to the book, man.

2967
02:36:04.86 --> 02:36:08.86
After my two months at the clinic, my, my enlistment term was,

2968
02:36:08.86 --> 02:36:11.86
in fact, coming to an end.

2969
02:36:11.86 --> 02:36:13.86
It didn't take a genius to see it.

2970
02:36:13.86 --> 02:36:16.86
I'd be, and I'd end up behind a desk.

2971
02:36:16.86 --> 02:36:18.86
So I chose not to re-enlist.

2972
02:36:18.86 --> 02:36:21.86
But I was in the court, so it hurt.

2973
02:36:21.86 --> 02:36:24.86
Before joining the court, I had three concussions,

2974
02:36:24.86 --> 02:36:27.86
mononucleosis, and an operation on my right knee.

2975
02:36:27.86 --> 02:36:31.86
When I musted out four years later, I'd added two operations on my right hand,

2976
02:36:31.86 --> 02:36:36.86
a right rotator cuff operation, a fourth concussion from an RPG, a dislocated shoulder,

2977
02:36:36.86 --> 02:36:41.86
and two herniated discs from clumsily lifting the dead and wounded.

2978
02:36:41.86 --> 02:36:45.86
One vertebrae, given way in Gonjago, when I picked up an asc orange slipped

2979
02:36:45.86 --> 02:36:49.86
mud under him. I have no idea when the second vertebrae went out during the battle.

2980
02:36:49.86 --> 02:36:54.86
I had that nick in my arm from a bullet or shrapnel, but that hadn't been anything.

2981
02:36:54.86 --> 02:36:57.86
I was in deep, at decent shape for construction work.

2982
02:36:57.86 --> 02:37:00.86
I figured.

2983
02:37:03.86 --> 02:37:07.86
After the PTSD clinic, I returned to Kentucky.

2984
02:37:07.86 --> 02:37:13.86
It was the winter of 2010, and I wore myself up by slipping back into hard drinking,

2985
02:37:13.86 --> 02:37:16.86
and I had to go to the beach night.

2986
02:37:16.86 --> 02:37:19.86
I hadn't seen an active duty grunt in months.

2987
02:37:19.86 --> 02:37:24.86
Fabio and Rodriguez Chavez were due to receive the Navy crosses at the Marine Corps base in

2988
02:37:24.86 --> 02:37:29.86
Conoco, but I couldn't get enough time off to fly back east, where you work in construction at this point.

2989
02:37:29.86 --> 02:37:35.86
And your boys are getting Navy crosses. You can't get time off from work.

2990
02:37:35.86 --> 02:37:38.86
Swenson and I had been recommended for the Medal of Honor.

2991
02:37:38.86 --> 02:37:43.86
We knew that the award was usually downgraded upon review.

2992
02:37:43.86 --> 02:37:48.86
When I drank, which was too much, I'd laugh at the absurdity.

2993
02:37:48.86 --> 02:37:58.86
I'd screwed up big time. My achievement was losing my brothers.

2994
02:37:58.86 --> 02:38:05.86
The Marine Corps would come to its senses, and I'd never hear another word from another devil dog.

2995
02:38:05.86 --> 02:38:12.86
I had no idea what was in front of me, and I didn't care.

2996
02:38:12.86 --> 02:38:15.86
I couldn't take a walk.

2997
02:38:15.86 --> 02:38:18.86
Turn on the TV or read a book to distract my mind.

2998
02:38:18.86 --> 02:38:23.86
The emptiness of my life was the dark all around me with nothing to see in any direction.

2999
02:38:23.86 --> 02:38:27.86
Four years ago, I'd left the farm for an adventure in a new beginning.

3000
02:38:27.86 --> 02:38:30.86
The courage shaped me and I had arrived in Afghanistan.

3001
02:38:30.86 --> 02:38:32.86
Confident, I do well in combat.

3002
02:38:32.86 --> 02:38:37.86
Sure enough, up at Monti, I had emerged as the young gun.

3003
02:38:37.86 --> 02:38:42.86
Every day brought fun, danger against the backdrop of spectacular mountains.

3004
02:38:42.86 --> 02:38:49.86
It was fun stuff, shooting thousands of rounds, not losing many people, and seeing the damage you inflicted.

3005
02:38:49.86 --> 02:38:54.86
There was no weapon I couldn't handle, and my team trusted me to get them out of any hotspot.

3006
02:38:54.86 --> 02:38:57.86
My cockiness put us in.

3007
02:38:57.86 --> 02:39:02.86
But when it counted most, I wasn't with them.

3008
02:39:02.86 --> 02:39:05.86
They weren't trained to do my job.

3009
02:39:05.86 --> 02:39:09.86
Gunny Johnson didn't spend every day behind a 240.

3010
02:39:09.86 --> 02:39:13.86
Staff Sergeant can't have been comfortable with weapons or angles of fire.

3011
02:39:13.86 --> 02:39:18.86
Doc Layton wasn't a fighter in Lieutenant Johnson didn't adjust fire missions.

3012
02:39:18.86 --> 02:39:19.86
We aren't worried.

3013
02:39:19.86 --> 02:39:24.86
We know you'll get us out of anything goes bad, Meyer.

3014
02:39:24.86 --> 02:39:27.86
Well, I didn't, Lieutenant.

3015
02:39:27.86 --> 02:39:33.86
I was a load of worthless shit, not there when you needed me.

3016
02:39:33.86 --> 02:39:43.86
Around three in the morning, I pulled my truck into the driveway of a shop owned by my high school friend, Derek Yates, and cut the engine.

3017
02:39:43.86 --> 02:39:48.86
I turned on the cab light and fished out by cell phone.

3018
02:39:48.86 --> 02:39:54.86
It wasn't right to burn my dad, but I wanted to connect one last time with someone.

3019
02:39:54.86 --> 02:39:59.86
I pecked out of text message to my friends and and Toby.

3020
02:39:59.86 --> 02:40:05.86
They had known me since I was a toddler, but they didn't know me that well did they.

3021
02:40:05.86 --> 02:40:15.86
Here I was, back where I had started with an aluminum bracelet with two names on each wrist.

3022
02:40:15.86 --> 02:40:18.86
That's what I had done with my life.

3023
02:40:18.86 --> 02:40:21.86
Lost four brothers.

3024
02:40:21.86 --> 02:40:31.86
I can't do it anymore.

3025
02:40:31.86 --> 02:40:36.86
I typed.

3026
02:40:36.86 --> 02:40:41.86
I reached into the glove compartment where I kept my clock.

3027
02:40:41.86 --> 02:40:46.86
I always kept a full magazine with a round chambered in the pistol.

3028
02:40:46.86 --> 02:40:50.86
A clock doesn't have a safety.

3029
02:40:50.86 --> 02:40:59.86
You pull the trigger and the weapon fires.

3030
02:40:59.86 --> 02:41:07.86
I stuck the gun to my head and squeezed the trigger.

3031
02:41:07.86 --> 02:41:11.86
I clicked.

3032
02:41:11.86 --> 02:41:13.86
Nothing.

3033
02:41:13.86 --> 02:41:16.86
Not a.

3034
02:41:16.86 --> 02:41:18.86
No round in the chamber.

3035
02:41:18.86 --> 02:41:27.86
As you can imagine, I sat there quite sobered up and in double shock.

3036
02:41:27.86 --> 02:41:33.86
Suicide is terminal self-revolition.

3037
02:41:33.86 --> 02:41:40.86
I was mixed up, but I knew my team would be disappointed in me.

3038
02:41:40.86 --> 02:41:44.86
Staff Sergeant Kenneth Beck would give me hell, which is where I would be.

3039
02:41:44.86 --> 02:41:47.86
Bad ending.

3040
02:41:47.86 --> 02:41:53.86
That was not going to happen.

3041
02:41:53.86 --> 02:41:57.86
But who it unloaded my pistol?

3042
02:41:57.86 --> 02:42:01.86
Right on the spot, I knew who had done it.

3043
02:42:01.86 --> 02:42:04.86
Have I ever talked to that person about it?

3044
02:42:04.86 --> 02:42:07.86
No.

3045
02:42:07.86 --> 02:42:12.86
I put away the pistol and drove home.

3046
02:42:12.86 --> 02:42:17.86
That night, I experienced no sudden change of direction in my life.

3047
02:42:17.86 --> 02:42:25.86
I didn't know where I was headed in the future, but I knew I knew quitting wasn't right.

3048
02:42:25.86 --> 02:42:28.86
Not that night.

3049
02:42:28.86 --> 02:42:35.86
Not ever.

3050
02:42:35.86 --> 02:42:44.86
You know, I had never told.

3051
02:42:44.86 --> 02:42:51.86
I had never told anybody about that night until it was published in the book.

3052
02:42:51.86 --> 02:43:01.86
I just felt like it was important to the story because I didn't want people to read the story.

3053
02:43:01.86 --> 02:43:04.86
And then just think that it was all okay when I came home.

3054
02:43:04.86 --> 02:43:11.86
I didn't want to give them that perspective and there are so many guys out there that write these books of the crazy shit that they do.

3055
02:43:11.86 --> 02:43:14.86
But they never talk about what?

3056
02:43:14.86 --> 02:43:17.86
What that crazy shit does to them.

3057
02:43:17.86 --> 02:43:22.86
Yeah, they never talk about that.

3058
02:43:22.86 --> 02:43:27.86
People read that and they're like, holy shit, that's crazy.

3059
02:43:27.86 --> 02:43:31.86
I could never do that because I deal with problems.

3060
02:43:31.86 --> 02:43:35.86
And it's like, we all do.

3061
02:43:35.86 --> 02:43:41.86
And I had to put it in to, I wanted people to know that I'm just a human.

3062
02:43:41.86 --> 02:43:42.86
I'm no different than them.

3063
02:43:42.86 --> 02:43:52.86
And I, I felt like that I couldn't put in the, if you want to call it good stuff and not put in the bad stuff.

3064
02:43:52.86 --> 02:44:01.86
It's, I'm sure there's some psychologists that could figure something out about this, but you got to the point, right?

3065
02:44:01.86 --> 02:44:05.86
And you made the decision clearly.

3066
02:44:05.86 --> 02:44:18.86
And you came out the other side by the grace of God, whoever knew you well enough to figure out that they needed to make sure you didn't have a loaded gun.

3067
02:44:18.86 --> 02:44:28.86
But that's a message for anybody that feels like they're in the same situation you felt like you were in, which is that there's not not going to get any better.

3068
02:44:28.86 --> 02:44:32.86
Is like, okay, come out the other side, man.

3069
02:44:32.86 --> 02:44:42.86
Come out the other side. And it was like, I mean, like you said, it's not a sudden change in direction, but you, but you knew.

3070
02:44:42.86 --> 02:44:44.86
I, uh, that you couldn't quit.

3071
02:44:44.86 --> 02:44:50.86
I always like to say that, you know, sometimes you find yourself in the middle of nowhere.

3072
02:44:50.86 --> 02:44:54.86
And sometimes in the middle of nowhere you find yourself.

3073
02:44:54.86 --> 02:45:00.86
And, uh, you know, I, uh, I, I, I had no idea what my life was going.

3074
02:45:00.86 --> 02:45:10.86
I made a deal with myself, you know, I had set their, and, uh, I had said, if I'm going to keep living this life this way,

3075
02:45:10.86 --> 02:45:15.86
rack, rack it back and get over with.

3076
02:45:15.86 --> 02:45:19.86
But I said, if I ever put the car in drive, I'll never look back.

3077
02:45:19.86 --> 02:45:23.86
And I said there, I'm not going to lie to you. I probably set there for five, ten minutes.

3078
02:45:23.86 --> 02:45:30.86
And I had done it at my buddy's shop because I knew he'd be there eight o'clock in the morning and he could just find me.

3079
02:45:30.86 --> 02:45:37.86
And, uh, I put it in drive and I just, I never look back, you know.

3080
02:45:37.86 --> 02:45:44.86
I, you know, and it's, I'm lucky. I'm fortunate that the gun didn't go off, right?

3081
02:45:44.86 --> 02:45:53.86
Um, but, um, you know, I think that, you know, you always got to hit that rock bottom, you know,

3082
02:45:53.86 --> 02:45:58.86
I think that, and that was for me. That was it. That was the rock bottom.

3083
02:45:58.86 --> 02:46:01.86
And, you know, it changed it.

3084
02:46:01.86 --> 02:46:08.86
And, I mean, again, I just want to stress this as much as I can to, because I believe me, I, I hear from people,

3085
02:46:08.86 --> 02:46:14.86
especially from veterans that are, that are walking this line, man. They're walking this line.

3086
02:46:14.86 --> 02:46:19.86
And, if you're walking that line, hold it.

3087
02:46:19.86 --> 02:46:25.86
Listen, it's not worth it. I mean, it's not like, you know, I had to change.

3088
02:46:25.86 --> 02:46:29.86
Honestly, I had to change the way that I looked at life.

3089
02:46:29.86 --> 02:46:32.86
The only problem there was is me.

3090
02:46:32.86 --> 02:46:36.86
You know, instead of just facing it and saying, hey, look, I want to fix this problem.

3091
02:46:36.86 --> 02:46:39.86
I was blaming everybody else for my problems.

3092
02:46:39.86 --> 02:46:48.86
And what I had to do was I had to say, you know, okay, if, you know, if the things that I

3093
02:46:48.86 --> 02:46:54.86
seen were so bad, I've seen what freedom cost first hand.

3094
02:46:54.86 --> 02:46:57.86
That's what's got me there.

3095
02:46:57.86 --> 02:47:02.86
So, if anything, I have more reason than anybody else in the face is playing it to go out and

3096
02:47:02.86 --> 02:47:07.86
make the most of my life because I've seen it firsthand of what it cost.

3097
02:47:07.86 --> 02:47:11.86
So, instead of walking around and feeling like, you know, I'm not feeling so far from my teammates,

3098
02:47:11.86 --> 02:47:15.86
because they're in a better place. They don't feel anymore.

3099
02:47:15.86 --> 02:47:19.86
I'm really just feeling so far from myself. And then by doing that, I'm sick.

3100
02:47:19.86 --> 02:47:23.86
I'm wasting the sacrifices that they made on my behalf.

3101
02:47:23.86 --> 02:47:26.86
And I had to change the way I looked at it.

3102
02:47:26.86 --> 02:47:31.86
Instead of using it as my excuse, I had to use it as my fuel.

3103
02:47:31.86 --> 02:47:33.86
And that's a choice.

3104
02:47:33.86 --> 02:47:35.86
That is a conscious choice.

3105
02:47:35.86 --> 02:47:39.86
You wake up every day and you decide how you look at the situation.

3106
02:47:39.86 --> 02:47:41.86
You decide what you do with it.

3107
02:47:41.86 --> 02:47:45.86
You decide whether you use it as your excuse to hold you back or you use it as your easy,

3108
02:47:45.86 --> 02:47:51.86
you know, valve of heighten who you are or you use it as your fuel to go out and

3109
02:47:51.86 --> 02:47:53.86
be the best that you can be.

3110
02:47:53.86 --> 02:47:55.86
You decide that nobody does. Nobody else does.

3111
02:47:55.86 --> 02:47:57.86
You do every day.

3112
02:47:57.86 --> 02:48:00.86
And it is a conscious choice.

3113
02:48:00.86 --> 02:48:05.86
I mean, I still deal with it, but I still make the choice.

3114
02:48:05.86 --> 02:48:08.86
That's awesome.

3115
02:48:08.86 --> 02:48:09.86
That's awesome.

3116
02:48:09.86 --> 02:48:13.86
And anybody that's listening, like I said, anybody that's listening,

3117
02:48:13.86 --> 02:48:15.86
and that's walking that line.

3118
02:48:15.86 --> 02:48:16.86
There you go.

3119
02:48:16.86 --> 02:48:18.86
Make the right choice.

3120
02:48:18.86 --> 02:48:19.86
Make the right choice.

3121
02:48:19.86 --> 02:48:20.86
Make the right choice.

3122
02:48:20.86 --> 02:48:21.86
Make the right choice.

3123
02:48:21.86 --> 02:48:24.86
And you know what the right choice is.

3124
02:48:24.86 --> 02:48:28.86
Yeah, I mean, you're talking about how much and I feel this too.

3125
02:48:28.86 --> 02:48:32.86
Like every day, how much am I letting down my friends that didn't come home?

3126
02:48:32.86 --> 02:48:38.86
If I'm not doing everything I can to take advantage of the gift they gave me

3127
02:48:38.86 --> 02:48:40.86
if to be sitting here right now.

3128
02:48:40.86 --> 02:48:41.86
Right.

3129
02:48:41.86 --> 02:48:45.86
I mean, I mean, I, any day that I don't want to go on and push on for myself,

3130
02:48:45.86 --> 02:48:47.86
I can look down.

3131
02:48:47.86 --> 02:48:48.86
I bet you anything.

3132
02:48:48.86 --> 02:48:52.86
I got four reasons right here that would switch me one day.

3133
02:48:52.86 --> 02:48:57.86
They would switch me my worst day to have one more day.

3134
02:48:57.86 --> 02:49:07.86
You know, and, and, and, and I just, you know, I, I'm not okay with letting their sacrifice

3135
02:49:07.86 --> 02:49:08.86
to be wasted.

3136
02:49:08.86 --> 02:49:10.86
I'm not okay with watching anybody else waste them.

3137
02:49:10.86 --> 02:49:14.86
So why would I be okay with letting myself waste them?

3138
02:49:14.86 --> 02:49:21.86
Well.

3139
02:49:21.86 --> 02:49:31.86
And the other thing I want to say is like walking that line, I want to say this and get it out there.

3140
02:49:31.86 --> 02:49:32.86
It's normal.

3141
02:49:32.86 --> 02:49:33.86
It's normal.

3142
02:49:33.86 --> 02:49:35.86
It doesn't mean you're weak.

3143
02:49:35.86 --> 02:49:36.86
It doesn't.

3144
02:49:36.86 --> 02:49:38.86
I want to get that, that's dig my out there.

3145
02:49:38.86 --> 02:49:42.86
You know, if I want to get that off the books is it's, it is a normal.

3146
02:49:42.86 --> 02:49:48.86
Like, I don't understand why why it's okay in our society or in the military.

3147
02:49:48.86 --> 02:49:52.86
A guy breaks his leg.

3148
02:49:52.86 --> 02:49:53.86
Okay.

3149
02:49:53.86 --> 02:49:57.86
Do you go get, make him run tomorrow?

3150
02:49:57.86 --> 02:49:59.86
You, he, he puts a cast on it.

3151
02:49:59.86 --> 02:50:02.86
He, he, he rehabs it.

3152
02:50:02.86 --> 02:50:04.86
It's the same thing with the mind.

3153
02:50:04.86 --> 02:50:06.86
It's the same thing.

3154
02:50:06.86 --> 02:50:07.86
It's the same thing.

3155
02:50:07.86 --> 02:50:09.86
You go in and you watch.

3156
02:50:09.86 --> 02:50:15.86
The, the people you have to worry about are the ones that go watch their close friends

3157
02:50:15.86 --> 02:50:23.86
and they watch human beings and they watch this evil and people die and suffer and don't have a reaction.

3158
02:50:23.86 --> 02:50:27.86
Those are the ones you have to worry about.

3159
02:50:27.86 --> 02:50:33.86
It is a normal reaction to a not normal situation and it's okay.

3160
02:50:33.86 --> 02:50:34.86
It's okay.

3161
02:50:34.86 --> 02:50:39.86
It is 100% okay.

3162
02:50:39.86 --> 02:50:41.86
Absolutely, man.

3163
02:50:41.86 --> 02:50:46.86
Absolutely.

3164
02:50:46.86 --> 02:50:53.46
As you, we mentioned quickly, you know, there was some buzz possibly about about you getting metal

3165
02:50:53.46 --> 02:50:54.86
on him.

3166
02:50:54.86 --> 02:50:55.86
Yeah.

3167
02:50:55.86 --> 02:50:57.46
And, but you know how it goes.

3168
02:50:57.46 --> 02:50:59.46
Like it was all, I didn't believe it.

3169
02:50:59.46 --> 02:51:02.46
I never, I never had any idea.

3170
02:51:02.46 --> 02:51:10.86
You know, you hear talk about it, silver star metal bar, navy cross, whatever right.

3171
02:51:10.86 --> 02:51:11.86
I didn't care.

3172
02:51:11.86 --> 02:51:12.86
I didn't care.

3173
02:51:12.86 --> 02:51:18.86
I, I, I promised the last thing that I ever thought about was an award.

3174
02:51:18.86 --> 02:51:20.86
An award.

3175
02:51:20.86 --> 02:51:24.86
That's the last thing.

3176
02:51:24.86 --> 02:51:28.86
Well, you get to prove.

3177
02:51:28.86 --> 02:51:34.86
And, going back to the book when the president hung that metal around my neck.

3178
02:51:34.86 --> 02:51:36.86
I felt gloom.

3179
02:51:36.86 --> 02:51:39.86
I couldn't smile and I said nothing.

3180
02:51:39.86 --> 02:51:44.86
I gave no remarks and avoided the press as a Marine.

3181
02:51:44.86 --> 02:51:50.86
You either bring your team home alive or you die trying.

3182
02:51:50.86 --> 02:51:56.86
My country was recognizing me for being a failure.

3183
02:51:56.86 --> 02:51:59.86
And for the worst day of my life.

3184
02:51:59.86 --> 02:52:03.86
The Marine common done general genome Amos.

3185
02:52:03.86 --> 02:52:06.86
And general joseph done for the 10th of ceremony.

3186
02:52:06.86 --> 02:52:11.86
Throughout the years after Gangegol, the Marine Corps leadership has provided consistent support,

3187
02:52:11.86 --> 02:52:15.86
not just to me, but to all who fought there.

3188
02:52:15.86 --> 02:52:21.86
The top and listed man in the Marine Corps, Sergeant Major Mike Barrett twice came to our farm to meet

3189
02:52:21.86 --> 02:52:26.86
my dad and granddad and to encourage me.

3190
02:52:26.86 --> 02:52:30.86
There's no such thing as a former Marine.

3191
02:52:30.86 --> 02:52:36.86
Fifty years after they've left active duty, Marine still sign emails to each other with SF,

3192
02:52:36.86 --> 02:52:39.86
Semper Fidelis, always faithful.

3193
02:52:39.86 --> 02:52:43.86
Of course, we have among us those who failed themselves, their family and society.

3194
02:52:43.86 --> 02:52:49.86
The fact remains though that the Corps expects every Marine to live by a set of core values,

3195
02:52:49.86 --> 02:52:53.86
in turn, the Corps keeps its side to the bargain.

3196
02:52:53.86 --> 02:52:57.86
You cannot ask anything more of an organization than that.

3197
02:52:57.86 --> 02:53:01.86
Medal of Honor, given in the name of the Congress of the United States of America,

3198
02:53:01.86 --> 02:53:09.86
symbolizes the courage and determination of our entire country.

3199
02:53:09.86 --> 02:53:17.86
And speaking of the country you are in New York.

3200
02:53:17.86 --> 02:53:26.86
I was in New York City at the Twin Tower Site Ground Zero with Gone Joshua Peterson.

3201
02:53:26.86 --> 02:53:29.86
Someone I knew from my first days in the Corps.

3202
02:53:29.86 --> 02:53:35.86
We were greeted by hundreds of police, firemen, construction workers, Wall Street guys and suits,

3203
02:53:35.86 --> 02:53:40.86
city officials and the families of the fallen.

3204
02:53:40.86 --> 02:53:44.86
Major I can't believe this scene Gone Peterson said,

3205
02:53:44.86 --> 02:53:49.86
make sure your ribbons are squared away.

3206
02:53:49.86 --> 02:53:52.86
We stood side by side.

3207
02:53:52.86 --> 02:53:58.86
Two grunts and sharply ironed khakis waving like we had one in election.

3208
02:53:58.86 --> 02:54:02.86
I thought of my sad, fumbling meetings with the family of team Monti,

3209
02:54:02.86 --> 02:54:09.86
the families of team Monti, when I couldn't think of much to say.

3210
02:54:09.86 --> 02:54:13.86
I was alive and their loved ones were not.

3211
02:54:13.86 --> 02:54:19.86
Now here I was standing before a monument for 3,000 dead.

3212
02:54:19.86 --> 02:54:25.86
I saw some big iron workers and hard hats standing off to one side.

3213
02:54:25.86 --> 02:54:31.86
When the ceremony ended they sneaked me in onto a work elevator.

3214
02:54:31.86 --> 02:54:38.86
Up we went to the top of the ride where we then climbed wooden ladders until we couldn't go any further.

3215
02:54:38.86 --> 02:54:41.86
Then there weren't any guardrails.

3216
02:54:41.86 --> 02:54:49.86
I stood there looking out at the most beautiful country in the world trying to make sense of my feelings.

3217
02:54:49.86 --> 02:54:51.86
This was where it had all started.

3218
02:54:51.86 --> 02:54:53.86
So many good people lost.

3219
02:54:53.86 --> 02:54:58.86
The people had been working here and the people I had known who had not gone blindly into uniform.

3220
02:54:58.86 --> 02:55:05.86
They had reasoned why Americans do that.

3221
02:55:05.86 --> 02:55:12.86
But they had gone ahead to do and to die.

3222
02:55:12.86 --> 02:55:19.86
An iron worker handed me a silver marker.

3223
02:55:19.86 --> 02:55:43.86
Then I wrote on a girder for those who gave all.

3224
02:55:43.86 --> 02:56:05.86
And that wraps up the book and you know you're talking about the wards and what happens and all that.

3225
02:56:05.86 --> 02:56:13.86
And I wanted to say this as well on the battlefield. On that battlefield and on every battle.

3226
02:56:13.86 --> 02:56:19.86
There are acts of extreme valor that no one will ever know about.

3227
02:56:19.86 --> 02:56:26.86
I'm talking about an infinite number.

3228
02:56:26.86 --> 02:56:31.86
No one's ever going to know about them.

3229
02:56:31.86 --> 02:56:37.86
And it's important to know that our military men and women don't do what they do for metals or ribbons.

3230
02:56:37.86 --> 02:56:44.86
They do what they do because they love freedom because they love America because they love their comrades and harms.

3231
02:56:44.86 --> 02:56:53.86
And that right there is why our country thrives in battle.

3232
02:56:53.86 --> 02:57:01.86
Not because of technological advances, not because of superior weaponry, not even the size of our military.

3233
02:57:01.86 --> 02:57:12.86
It's because of the bond that is shared between warriors that is our real strength.

3234
02:57:12.86 --> 02:57:20.86
And to call to that something that you represent in spades.

3235
02:57:20.86 --> 02:57:25.86
And you know, I want to thank you for coming all the podcast.

3236
02:57:25.86 --> 02:57:33.86
And sharing this incredible story and I know it's not only a story of you, but it's a story of all the men.

3237
02:57:33.86 --> 02:57:43.86
American and Afghan as well that wrote in the battle with you that day and showed once again what it is that makes America a place of.

3238
02:57:43.86 --> 02:57:52.86
Of hope and of freedom. It's because of.

3239
02:57:52.86 --> 02:58:02.86
It's because of men, it's because of individual men that in their heart and even in the face of death.

3240
02:58:02.86 --> 02:58:11.86
Actually live actually live the ideals of this great nation.

3241
02:58:11.86 --> 02:58:26.86
Not only in their words, but in their actions in the way that they live and in the way that they died.

3242
02:58:26.86 --> 02:58:31.86
God bless all.

3243
02:58:31.86 --> 02:58:34.86
Incredible.

3244
02:58:34.86 --> 02:58:44.86
You know what I mean? You're exactly right. I mean, there's so many stories that are, I mean, people have done.

3245
02:58:44.86 --> 02:58:48.86
So many stories that people are doing such incredible stuff.

3246
02:58:48.86 --> 02:58:55.86
And you know, it's, it's literally out of the love of another human being.

3247
02:58:55.86 --> 02:58:59.86
It's literally out of love of making the world a better place.

3248
02:58:59.86 --> 02:59:09.86
That's really, that's really all we do. It's all we do. I mean, we join nobody joins it. Okay.

3249
02:59:09.86 --> 02:59:12.86
To go just shoot people or fight.

3250
02:59:12.86 --> 02:59:18.86
They literally joined to try to make the world around them a better place.

3251
02:59:18.86 --> 02:59:28.86
Whether it's passing out a, whether it's rendering aid to a civilian or to a, you know, a fellow American or a woman.

3252
02:59:28.86 --> 02:59:33.86
Or whether it's taken out the bully that's inflicting fear.

3253
02:59:33.86 --> 02:59:43.86
And that place, everything that we do is to try to make the world just a little bit better.

3254
02:59:43.86 --> 02:59:46.86
That's it.

3255
02:59:46.86 --> 02:59:55.86
You know, as I was reading about when, when you got back to your team, you could see, I mean, just from the way the guys were laid out.

3256
02:59:55.86 --> 03:00:03.86
You know, staff sergeant was trying to get comms and trying to pass grids and dock was working on the boss.

3257
03:00:03.86 --> 03:00:06.86
I mean, everyone was trying to make things happen.

3258
03:00:06.86 --> 03:00:13.86
And who knows what those moments were like, you know, but there's moments of, there's, there's heroism there that we're never going to know about.

3259
03:00:13.86 --> 03:00:22.86
No, I mean, I mean, 100% I mean, dock late was rendering aid, you know, what stopped them was because Fossail was with them.

3260
03:00:22.86 --> 03:00:30.86
What stopped them, I've get into the road was Lieutenant Johnson got hit.

3261
03:00:30.86 --> 03:00:37.86
And, uh, gunny can't have it in gunny Johnson, we're on either side, provide security while dock late and worked on him.

3262
03:00:37.86 --> 03:00:43.86
And that was the meta-back we heard called in from gunny can't have it was trying to call that meta-back in for Lieutenant Johnson.

3263
03:00:43.86 --> 03:00:44.86
Right here.

3264
03:00:44.86 --> 03:00:53.86
And, um, you know, but they weren't going to leave him behind.

3265
03:00:53.86 --> 03:00:57.86
Even more, even more of not leaving him behind.

3266
03:00:57.86 --> 03:01:01.86
They weren't going to just throw him over shoulder and get him out.

3267
03:01:01.86 --> 03:01:06.86
They were going to try to fix him.

3268
03:01:06.86 --> 03:01:09.86
I mean, what do you say?

3269
03:01:09.86 --> 03:01:15.86
I mean, you know, that right there, I mean, that right there's everything.

3270
03:01:15.86 --> 03:01:19.86
I mean, you take that, you take, I mean, there's so many actions.

3271
03:01:19.86 --> 03:01:24.86
I mean, I've watched people do such incredible things, such incredible things.

3272
03:01:24.86 --> 03:01:32.86
That just make what I do, I mean, you know, it makes me look like I've done nothing.

3273
03:01:32.86 --> 03:01:37.86
I've seen it, you know, people are incredible.

3274
03:01:37.86 --> 03:01:43.86
Well, again, I mean, I can't thank you enough for coming on.

3275
03:01:43.86 --> 03:01:44.86
Oh, thank you.

3276
03:01:44.86 --> 03:01:58.86
On the podcast and hanging out and being out there and kicking ass and talking smack to people, I like that too.

3277
03:01:58.86 --> 03:02:01.86
Uh, got a miss anything? Anything else?

3278
03:02:01.86 --> 03:02:03.86
No, not me here.

3279
03:02:03.86 --> 03:02:04.86
I thank you.

3280
03:02:04.86 --> 03:02:05.86
Thank you covered at all.

3281
03:02:05.86 --> 03:02:06.86
Thank you, guys.

3282
03:02:06.86 --> 03:02:07.86
I thank you.

3283
03:02:07.86 --> 03:02:10.86
I, uh, I thank you covered it.

3284
03:02:10.86 --> 03:02:12.86
You know, echo.

3285
03:02:12.86 --> 03:02:15.86
You, you got any questions for the man over there?

3286
03:02:15.86 --> 03:02:22.86
No, usually I come up with some lighthearted question, but man, I'm out of words to be honest.

3287
03:02:22.86 --> 03:02:25.86
We took that little break.

3288
03:02:25.86 --> 03:02:26.86
Yeah.

3289
03:02:26.86 --> 03:02:31.86
And echo's like, man, he's like, I just keep the, he's like, I'm sitting there thinking of myself.

3290
03:02:31.86 --> 03:02:32.86
This really happened, man.

3291
03:02:32.86 --> 03:02:35.86
And I'm like, yeah, I told I gave, I give echo heads up sometimes.

3292
03:02:35.86 --> 03:02:39.86
You know, I say, hey, man, it's going to be heavy one or whatever.

3293
03:02:39.86 --> 03:02:43.86
And I was like, told him this afternoon, I'm like, hey, man, it's going to be heavy one.

3294
03:02:43.86 --> 03:02:48.86
You know, stand by and, you know, we're downstairs when we're taking that break.

3295
03:02:48.86 --> 03:02:50.86
He's like, man.

3296
03:02:50.86 --> 03:02:52.86
Oh, all this really happened.

3297
03:02:52.86 --> 03:02:55.86
I said, yeah, and you know, who happened to the guy we're sitting in a room with.

3298
03:02:55.86 --> 03:02:57.86
And his friends, like, that's what happened.

3299
03:02:57.86 --> 03:03:04.86
So, uh, no, it early on when I started this podcast, I'd be reading a book from night from World War One.

3300
03:03:04.86 --> 03:03:05.86
Yeah.

3301
03:03:05.86 --> 03:03:08.86
Or I'd be reading a book from World War Two or feet in a number, whatever.

3302
03:03:08.86 --> 03:03:12.86
And I'd like after, I don't know how many podcasts, but like seven or eight podcasts.

3303
03:03:12.86 --> 03:03:16.86
I was like, hey, I just want to stop for a second.

3304
03:03:16.86 --> 03:03:22.86
And remind everybody that the characters that I'm talking about in these books, these characters,

3305
03:03:22.86 --> 03:03:24.86
they're not characters in a movie.

3306
03:03:24.86 --> 03:03:25.86
They're, they're people.

3307
03:03:25.86 --> 03:03:27.86
They're, they're humans.

3308
03:03:27.86 --> 03:03:33.86
And this stuff that we're talking about really happened to these people.

3309
03:03:33.86 --> 03:03:41.86
So, again, it's obviously having you sitting here and I was talking to you about when Colonel William Rieder was in here.

3310
03:03:41.86 --> 03:03:45.86
And, you know, you're like, you're reading stuff that happened to him.

3311
03:03:45.86 --> 03:03:50.86
He was tortured. He was mock execution. He had, he had.

3312
03:03:50.86 --> 03:03:56.86
He was locked in a bamboo, a two-foot tall bamboo cage in the jungles in Vietnam.

3313
03:03:56.86 --> 03:03:58.86
And he's got his legs and shackles.

3314
03:03:58.86 --> 03:04:04.86
And he's trying to sleep and he's getting woke and up by the rats that are eating the wounds and his legs.

3315
03:04:04.86 --> 03:04:09.86
And it's like, that's just inconceivable.

3316
03:04:09.86 --> 03:04:12.86
I mean, it had happened.

3317
03:04:12.86 --> 03:04:16.86
Yeah. I mean, that's, you know, I hear stories like that.

3318
03:04:16.86 --> 03:04:20.86
And just, you know, that's real people.

3319
03:04:20.86 --> 03:04:21.86
Yeah.

3320
03:04:21.86 --> 03:04:23.86
These are real people.

3321
03:04:23.86 --> 03:04:25.86
Just like us.

3322
03:04:25.86 --> 03:04:32.86
Yeah. And honestly, man, I mean, I'm sure you saw me like sometimes, you know, I'm getting,

3323
03:04:32.86 --> 03:04:35.86
I get emotional and I read your story.

3324
03:04:35.86 --> 03:04:37.86
But why do I get emotional when I read your story?

3325
03:04:37.86 --> 03:04:40.86
Because I'm thinking of everything I've been thinking of my friends.

3326
03:04:40.86 --> 03:04:48.86
And I'm just like, it's, man, you know, it's, it's real.

3327
03:04:48.86 --> 03:04:54.86
And for those of you people that are listening to this and I talked to, I addressed like the veterans out there.

3328
03:04:54.86 --> 03:04:57.86
I'll bunch today.

3329
03:04:57.86 --> 03:05:04.86
But, you know, to those of you that didn't have the opportunity to serve for whatever reason, you know,

3330
03:05:04.86 --> 03:05:13.86
if I could relate something to you, it's like, yeah, these, these people, these lieutenants, these sergeants, these staff sergeants,

3331
03:05:13.86 --> 03:05:16.86
and their people, man.

3332
03:05:16.86 --> 03:05:17.86
They're people.

3333
03:05:17.86 --> 03:05:18.86
Yeah.

3334
03:05:18.86 --> 03:05:20.86
They're just, they're just people.

3335
03:05:20.86 --> 03:05:21.86
Yeah.

3336
03:05:21.86 --> 03:05:23.86
They're just people.

3337
03:05:23.86 --> 03:05:26.86
I mean, that's, they're just people.

3338
03:05:26.86 --> 03:05:32.86
They're just, and, you know, and I think that that's kind of what makes it hard for society of,

3339
03:05:32.86 --> 03:05:35.86
is that they see so many of these movies.

3340
03:05:35.86 --> 03:05:46.86
And they read these books and, you know, they read it, but what they don't understand is that somebody lived it.

3341
03:05:46.86 --> 03:05:51.86
You know, and I think that that's a perspective that you always have to remind yourself of is that,

3342
03:05:51.86 --> 03:05:53.86
yeah, you're reading it.

3343
03:05:53.86 --> 03:05:55.86
And, but somebody lived it.

3344
03:05:55.86 --> 03:05:59.86
You know, yeah.

3345
03:05:59.86 --> 03:06:09.86
Then you kind of see, you know, on the news, like, oh, yeah, then the metal of honor ceremony and the pictures, you know, of you getting there.

3346
03:06:09.86 --> 03:06:12.86
And, you know, you see the president putting it on.

3347
03:06:12.86 --> 03:06:14.86
It's like, wow, that's so great at whatever.

3348
03:06:14.86 --> 03:06:20.86
And, you know, what you don't, what we don't see, you know, people who haven't served.

3349
03:06:20.86 --> 03:06:28.86
Oh, is like, what really happened to, to arrive at that one quote unquote glorious moment.

3350
03:06:28.86 --> 03:06:33.86
You get the metal, oh my gosh, thank you, let's go party or so I don't know something, you know, like it's just,

3351
03:06:33.86 --> 03:06:35.86
it's like, dang, but I did.

3352
03:06:35.86 --> 03:06:38.86
Yeah, people think it's just so great, you know, and,

3353
03:06:38.86 --> 03:06:43.86
I got, I despise everything that metal stands for.

3354
03:06:43.86 --> 03:06:47.86
For me, you know, may not anybody else.

3355
03:06:47.86 --> 03:06:54.86
But I, you know, when I put that metal around my neck,

3356
03:06:54.86 --> 03:07:02.86
to me, it's literally, here's the stamp to show the world how bad I felt.

3357
03:07:02.86 --> 03:07:09.86
Here's the, you know, that's why I don't wear it.

3358
03:07:09.86 --> 03:07:15.86
I don't wear it because, you know, it's the worst day of my life.

3359
03:07:15.86 --> 03:07:18.86
And, uh, I lost everything that day.

3360
03:07:18.86 --> 03:07:20.86
I lost not just my team.

3361
03:07:20.86 --> 03:07:23.86
I lost my career in the Marine Corps.

3362
03:07:23.86 --> 03:07:29.86
I mean, everything that I wanted to be was gone within one day.

3363
03:07:29.86 --> 03:07:33.86
And, you know, and then I get recognized for it.

3364
03:07:33.86 --> 03:07:37.86
You know, so not only do you have to live with it,

3365
03:07:37.86 --> 03:07:42.86
but now you have to live with it in the face of the nation.

3366
03:07:42.86 --> 03:07:53.86
Well, from that perspective, from my perspective, looking at that,

3367
03:07:53.86 --> 03:07:59.86
for one thing, the metal, yeah, I mean, it was put around your neck,

3368
03:07:59.86 --> 03:08:04.86
but I believe that metal represents everyone that was with your team.

3369
03:08:04.86 --> 03:08:05.86
Yeah.

3370
03:08:05.86 --> 03:08:08.86
And you might have gotten the, the, the metal put around your neck,

3371
03:08:08.86 --> 03:08:10.86
but it's, it represents that story.

3372
03:08:10.86 --> 03:08:13.86
It's going to be told over and over again.

3373
03:08:13.86 --> 03:08:15.86
And your name might be at the top of the list,

3374
03:08:15.86 --> 03:08:17.86
but every name is going to be on that list.

3375
03:08:17.86 --> 03:08:18.86
Everyone's going to know.

3376
03:08:18.86 --> 03:08:26.86
And I mean, obviously, I can't imagine the burden that comes with that metal that you live with.

3377
03:08:26.86 --> 03:08:32.86
But at the same time, being able to have that,

3378
03:08:32.86 --> 03:08:35.86
have your brothers remembered.

3379
03:08:35.86 --> 03:08:38.86
I think that it makes it worthwhile.

3380
03:08:38.86 --> 03:08:41.86
And, and you know, and that's the piece of it, you're right.

3381
03:08:41.86 --> 03:08:46.86
I mean, so on the selfish, you know, when I, what I just said was on the selfish side of it,

3382
03:08:46.86 --> 03:08:49.86
right, that, that, that, that is for me.

3383
03:08:49.86 --> 03:08:56.86
That, that is the only reason I did accept the metal was because I want my teammates to live on forever.

3384
03:08:56.86 --> 03:09:04.86
I want people to know who they were, because the day that I stop speaking their name is the day they truly die.

3385
03:09:04.86 --> 03:09:12.86
And I have an obligation that as long as I can still breathe that their names are still need to be told.

3386
03:09:12.86 --> 03:09:16.86
And so that's what that metal allows me to do.

3387
03:09:16.86 --> 03:09:18.86
And it is their metal.

3388
03:09:18.86 --> 03:09:20.86
I mean, it's, it's for them.

3389
03:09:20.86 --> 03:09:28.86
But, yeah, I mean, you know, you don't, it just goes against, you know,

3390
03:09:28.86 --> 03:09:32.86
and I think the one thing, you know, that it's so hard for us to wrap around is,

3391
03:09:32.86 --> 03:09:36.86
how many times are you training?

3392
03:09:36.86 --> 03:09:40.86
Did, how many times did you sit like when you were training guys and this and that?

3393
03:09:40.86 --> 03:09:45.86
How many times did you ever set them up for when they did everything that they could?

3394
03:09:45.86 --> 03:09:49.86
They failed.

3395
03:09:49.86 --> 03:09:50.86
It's beyond us with you.

3396
03:09:50.86 --> 03:09:53.86
When I was running training, I did that all the time.

3397
03:09:53.86 --> 03:09:54.86
Yeah.

3398
03:09:54.86 --> 03:09:55.86
I'm not kidding.

3399
03:09:55.86 --> 03:09:57.86
I mean, you can talk to anybody that went through training when I ran it.

3400
03:09:57.86 --> 03:09:59.86
It was, it was just mayhem.

3401
03:09:59.86 --> 03:10:03.86
And it was, you were going to, you know, you were going to carry out bodies.

3402
03:10:03.86 --> 03:10:08.86
You had 16 guys in a hotel and you were going to be carrying it six bodies out.

3403
03:10:08.86 --> 03:10:11.86
And you're going to be carrying them for four kilometers to a helicopter,

3404
03:10:11.86 --> 03:10:14.86
extraque, which wasn't going to show up and you're going to have to go another six.

3405
03:10:14.86 --> 03:10:16.86
It was brutal.

3406
03:10:16.86 --> 03:10:17.86
Yeah.

3407
03:10:17.86 --> 03:10:20.86
And there was times where I'd kill every single, you know, training.

3408
03:10:20.86 --> 03:10:23.86
I'd kill every single seal because they were not doing what they were supposed to do.

3409
03:10:23.86 --> 03:10:24.86
They were making mistakes.

3410
03:10:24.86 --> 03:10:25.86
The leadership wasn't stepping up.

3411
03:10:25.86 --> 03:10:27.86
I did that all the time.

3412
03:10:27.86 --> 03:10:28.86
Yeah.

3413
03:10:28.86 --> 03:10:37.86
I mean, I came back from Ramadi where when my guys were some really bad situations.

3414
03:10:37.86 --> 03:10:41.86
And I wanted everyone to be ready for that, man.

3415
03:10:41.86 --> 03:10:50.86
And like that was, it was, I mean, I was not, I mean, I came back from home and got put in charge of training.

3416
03:10:50.86 --> 03:10:51.86
It was awesome.

3417
03:10:51.86 --> 03:10:53.86
It was the best thing that I ever could have done for me.

3418
03:10:53.86 --> 03:10:56.86
And I thought it was the best thing I could do for my teammates.

3419
03:10:56.86 --> 03:11:00.86
It was to be like, okay, we're going to make this training hard really hard.

3420
03:11:00.86 --> 03:11:05.86
And so probably not, you probably thought I was going to say never, but man, when I was running training.

3421
03:11:05.86 --> 03:11:07.86
And that's awesome.

3422
03:11:07.86 --> 03:11:12.86
And I had, I mean, I had many guys that came back from Iraq and Afghanistan.

3423
03:11:12.86 --> 03:11:15.86
And would say like, yeah, amen.

3424
03:11:15.86 --> 03:11:20.86
We got hammered hard in this situation.

3425
03:11:20.86 --> 03:11:22.86
And we were ready.

3426
03:11:22.86 --> 03:11:26.86
Nothing is bad as your situation, but yeah.

3427
03:11:26.86 --> 03:11:31.86
But the mentality of it is, you know, there are some situations you're not going to win.

3428
03:11:31.86 --> 03:11:37.86
There are some situations where you show up and you're not going to win.

3429
03:11:37.86 --> 03:11:42.86
And that's against everything that we believe and everything that we're taught.

3430
03:11:42.86 --> 03:11:50.86
You know, I mean that if we do our job and we do it right, and you still lose,

3431
03:11:50.86 --> 03:11:53.86
it doesn't make sense.

3432
03:11:53.86 --> 03:11:59.86
Well, that's something I've told many guys is, man, you, you can do everything right.

3433
03:11:59.86 --> 03:12:02.86
You can make no mistakes, and you can still get killed.

3434
03:12:02.86 --> 03:12:06.86
You can still, you can still, you can still, things, you know, there's decisions that you make on the battlefield.

3435
03:12:06.86 --> 03:12:10.86
You say, if you say, okay, go left, you can go left and everyone could be great.

3436
03:12:10.86 --> 03:12:13.86
And it's the best decision ever, you could say go left and everyone could die.

3437
03:12:13.86 --> 03:12:15.86
And it's the worst decision ever.

3438
03:12:15.86 --> 03:12:17.86
There's things that you can't control inside of combat.

3439
03:12:17.86 --> 03:12:20.86
So you prepare and train as hard as you can.

3440
03:12:20.86 --> 03:12:26.86
And the other thing you do is you get the leadership in the city of mentality that they're not going to put themselves.

3441
03:12:26.86 --> 03:12:30.86
This is like, if my guys planned something that was stupid, I'd let him execute.

3442
03:12:30.86 --> 03:12:31.86
This is in training.

3443
03:12:31.86 --> 03:12:34.86
If they came up with a dumb plan, they were going to execute that plan.

3444
03:12:34.86 --> 03:12:37.86
I wasn't going to stop them and they were going to get slaughtered.

3445
03:12:37.86 --> 03:12:39.86
So they learned some lessons.

3446
03:12:39.86 --> 03:12:43.86
But that's why that training is so important and it's important and everything.

3447
03:12:43.86 --> 03:12:48.86
100%. 100%. I appreciate you having me on.

3448
03:12:48.86 --> 03:12:50.86
Yeah, man, thanks for coming on, brother.

3449
03:12:50.86 --> 03:12:52.86
I think something like man is awesome.

3450
03:12:52.86 --> 03:12:53.86
It's a human man.

3451
03:12:53.86 --> 03:12:54.86
Yeah, right.

3452
03:12:54.86 --> 03:12:57.86
I do not accept that from you.

3453
03:12:57.86 --> 03:12:59.86
You are the man.

3454
03:12:59.86 --> 03:13:00.86
All right, echo.

3455
03:13:00.86 --> 03:13:01.86
Yes.

3456
03:13:01.86 --> 03:13:03.86
Talk about something good.

3457
03:13:03.86 --> 03:13:04.86
Sure, chill.

3458
03:13:04.86 --> 03:13:06.86
It was a little bit.

3459
03:13:06.86 --> 03:13:08.86
Okay, what do you mean?

3460
03:13:08.86 --> 03:13:11.86
Okay, so it was shift gears kind of a rough transition.

3461
03:13:11.86 --> 03:13:14.86
I'll let you know that we're like three hours plus right now.

3462
03:13:14.86 --> 03:13:16.86
So you could do it quickly if you want.

3463
03:13:16.86 --> 03:13:18.86
If I want, please.

3464
03:13:18.86 --> 03:13:20.86
See how I kind of recommend it.

3465
03:13:20.86 --> 03:13:23.86
Well, I feel like me and Dakota, we have some catching up to do.

3466
03:13:23.86 --> 03:13:24.86
You guys have been talking.

3467
03:13:24.86 --> 03:13:26.86
So, you know, I might drag this a little bit.

3468
03:13:26.86 --> 03:13:27.86
No.

3469
03:13:27.86 --> 03:13:28.86
Okay.

3470
03:13:28.86 --> 03:13:29.86
So, origin mean.

3471
03:13:29.86 --> 03:13:32.86
This is where you get jocco supplements, cruel oil.

3472
03:13:32.86 --> 03:13:33.86
Join warfers.

3473
03:13:33.86 --> 03:13:34.86
Free of joints.

3474
03:13:34.86 --> 03:13:35.86
Free of joints.

3475
03:13:35.86 --> 03:13:36.86
Yes.

3476
03:13:36.86 --> 03:13:37.86
Important supplement.

3477
03:13:37.86 --> 03:13:38.86
Yes.

3478
03:13:38.86 --> 03:13:39.86
Important supplement.

3479
03:13:39.86 --> 03:13:40.86
Yeah.

3480
03:13:40.86 --> 03:13:47.86
Also, he has one called discipline to cognitive and physical enhancement supplement.

3481
03:13:47.86 --> 03:13:48.86
Pre-workout.

3482
03:13:48.86 --> 03:13:49.86
Pre-mission.

3483
03:13:49.86 --> 03:13:50.86
So it's called.

3484
03:13:50.86 --> 03:13:51.86
It's a good one.

3485
03:13:51.86 --> 03:13:52.86
Also at origin.

3486
03:13:52.86 --> 03:13:55.86
It's origin main.com main in the state.

3487
03:13:55.86 --> 03:13:56.86
Not like the main one.

3488
03:13:56.86 --> 03:13:57.86
Yeah.

3489
03:13:57.86 --> 03:13:58.86
Yeah.

3490
03:13:58.86 --> 03:13:59.86
It's good.

3491
03:13:59.86 --> 03:14:02.86
Um, you got gues on there for jiu-jitsu.

3492
03:14:02.86 --> 03:14:03.86
You trained jiu-jitsu right?

3493
03:14:03.86 --> 03:14:04.86
I do.

3494
03:14:04.86 --> 03:14:05.86
Yeah.

3495
03:14:05.86 --> 03:14:08.86
So if you get the origin gui, those are all made in America.

3496
03:14:08.86 --> 03:14:09.86
Everything in origin.

3497
03:14:09.86 --> 03:14:12.86
You may get you an origin gui since our main american.

3498
03:14:12.86 --> 03:14:14.86
You got to represent some American.

3499
03:14:14.86 --> 03:14:15.86
Yeah.

3500
03:14:15.86 --> 03:14:16.86
Yeah.

3501
03:14:16.86 --> 03:14:17.86
I like it.

3502
03:14:17.86 --> 03:14:18.86
Yeah.

3503
03:14:18.86 --> 03:14:19.86
From the threads.

3504
03:14:19.86 --> 03:14:20.86
From the content.

3505
03:14:20.86 --> 03:14:21.86
By the way, the growth of the content in America.

3506
03:14:21.86 --> 03:14:24.86
Not the kind of the import, the fact that we assemble it.

3507
03:14:24.86 --> 03:14:25.86
Everything.

3508
03:14:25.86 --> 03:14:26.86
From seed.

3509
03:14:26.86 --> 03:14:27.86
What is it?

3510
03:14:27.86 --> 03:14:28.86
From seed.

3511
03:14:28.86 --> 03:14:29.86
From seed.

3512
03:14:29.86 --> 03:14:30.86
From.

3513
03:14:30.86 --> 03:14:31.86
To share.

3514
03:14:31.86 --> 03:14:32.86
To share.

3515
03:14:32.86 --> 03:14:33.86
I'm pretty good.

3516
03:14:33.86 --> 03:14:34.86
Yeah.

3517
03:14:34.86 --> 03:14:35.86
It was good.

3518
03:14:35.86 --> 03:14:36.86
I liked it.

3519
03:14:36.86 --> 03:14:37.86
They got some rash cards on there.

3520
03:14:37.86 --> 03:14:38.86
Spats.

3521
03:14:38.86 --> 03:14:38.86
Yeah.

3522
03:14:38.86 --> 03:14:39.86
You got some of that.

3523
03:14:39.86 --> 03:14:40.86
You got some of that.

3524
03:14:40.86 --> 03:14:41.86
You know what?

3525
03:14:41.86 --> 03:14:42.86
Spats are.

3526
03:14:42.86 --> 03:14:42.86
Yeah.

3527
03:14:42.86 --> 03:14:43.86
We didn't really either.

3528
03:14:43.86 --> 03:14:44.86
We had to kind of.

3529
03:14:44.86 --> 03:14:45.86
We had to research it.

3530
03:14:45.86 --> 03:14:46.86
All right.

3531
03:14:46.86 --> 03:14:47.86
That's bad.

3532
03:14:47.86 --> 03:14:48.86
Here's the bottom one.

3533
03:14:48.86 --> 03:14:49.86
There's pandex.

3534
03:14:49.86 --> 03:14:50.86
There's pandex.

3535
03:14:50.86 --> 03:14:50.86
They're tights.

3536
03:14:50.86 --> 03:14:51.86
Basically.

3537
03:14:51.86 --> 03:14:52.86
I'm a compression gui.

3538
03:14:52.86 --> 03:14:53.86
Wait.

3539
03:14:53.86 --> 03:14:54.86
Do you train at 10th planet?

3540
03:14:54.86 --> 03:14:55.86
Do you train at some?

3541
03:14:55.86 --> 03:14:57.86
Sometimes you see dudes down there.

3542
03:14:57.86 --> 03:14:58.86
There's plainers.

3543
03:14:58.86 --> 03:14:59.86
Yeah.

3544
03:14:59.86 --> 03:14:59.86
Yeah.

3545
03:14:59.86 --> 03:15:00.86
I always talk about them.

3546
03:15:00.86 --> 03:15:01.86
Yeah.

3547
03:15:01.86 --> 03:15:02.86
They're all about the spats.

3548
03:15:02.86 --> 03:15:03.86
They're all about the spats.

3549
03:15:03.86 --> 03:15:04.86
I was worried about.

3550
03:15:04.86 --> 03:15:06.86
I was worried about using the word spats.

3551
03:15:06.86 --> 03:15:09.86
I didn't sound like maybe with some kind of like.

3552
03:15:09.86 --> 03:15:10.86
Yeah.

3553
03:15:10.86 --> 03:15:12.86
Let's just say those out of kind of girlish.

3554
03:15:12.86 --> 03:15:15.86
Like some girl that like like a girl would be like, oh, I'm going to

3555
03:15:15.86 --> 03:15:16.86
Wait.

3556
03:15:16.86 --> 03:15:17.86
Like I'm going to.

3557
03:15:17.86 --> 03:15:18.86
You thought there were spanks.

3558
03:15:18.86 --> 03:15:19.86
What are those?

3559
03:15:19.86 --> 03:15:20.86
Because it sounds like spank.

3560
03:15:20.86 --> 03:15:21.86
I don't know.

3561
03:15:21.86 --> 03:15:22.86
What's that?

3562
03:15:22.86 --> 03:15:23.86
Yeah.

3563
03:15:23.86 --> 03:15:25.86
Spank's real tight.

3564
03:15:25.86 --> 03:15:26.86
Like it's kind of like it's essentially compression.

3565
03:15:26.86 --> 03:15:27.86
It is.

3566
03:15:27.86 --> 03:15:27.86
It's compression.

3567
03:15:27.86 --> 03:15:28.86
Yeah.

3568
03:15:28.86 --> 03:15:29.86
It's like.

3569
03:15:29.86 --> 03:15:29.86
Yeah.

3570
03:15:29.86 --> 03:15:30.86
Yeah.

3571
03:15:30.86 --> 03:15:31.86
Okay.

3572
03:15:31.86 --> 03:15:32.86
They should be.

3573
03:15:32.86 --> 03:15:33.86
They should be illegal.

3574
03:15:33.86 --> 03:15:34.86
I figured out.

3575
03:15:34.86 --> 03:15:37.86
They're illegal because it's like selling.

3576
03:15:37.86 --> 03:15:38.86
It's falsetto.

3577
03:15:38.86 --> 03:15:39.86
It's falsetto.

3578
03:15:39.86 --> 03:15:40.86
Yeah.

3579
03:15:40.86 --> 03:15:41.86
I was on.

3580
03:15:41.86 --> 03:15:43.86
We were on like some kind of live broadcast.

3581
03:15:43.86 --> 03:15:44.86
And someone.

3582
03:15:44.86 --> 03:15:49.86
Spats is comes from what soldiers, cavalry soldiers in World War One.

3583
03:15:49.86 --> 03:15:50.86
War like leggings.

3584
03:15:50.86 --> 03:15:51.86
And they were called spats.

3585
03:15:51.86 --> 03:15:52.86
And I was like, okay.

3586
03:15:52.86 --> 03:15:53.86
It's cool.

3587
03:15:53.86 --> 03:15:54.86
Well, we'll say it now.

3588
03:15:54.86 --> 03:15:55.86
Yeah.

3589
03:15:55.86 --> 03:15:55.86
How like it.

3590
03:15:55.86 --> 03:15:56.86
There weren't really even laging there.

3591
03:15:56.86 --> 03:15:57.86
Just like this lower.

3592
03:15:57.86 --> 03:15:59.86
Even that lower part that covers the boot.

3593
03:15:59.86 --> 03:16:00.86
Yeah.

3594
03:16:00.86 --> 03:16:01.86
Yeah.

3595
03:16:01.86 --> 03:16:02.86
Yeah.

3596
03:16:02.86 --> 03:16:04.86
That's something else.

3597
03:16:04.86 --> 03:16:05.86
What are those things called?

3598
03:16:05.86 --> 03:16:06.86
Jibdo honor guard.

3599
03:16:06.86 --> 03:16:07.86
You had to wear those things?

3600
03:16:07.86 --> 03:16:08.86
No.

3601
03:16:08.86 --> 03:16:10.86
I think they were actually called leggings.

3602
03:16:10.86 --> 03:16:10.86
Wait.

3603
03:16:10.86 --> 03:16:12.86
So we're unclear about what's going on.

3604
03:16:12.86 --> 03:16:13.86
I know what spats are.

3605
03:16:13.86 --> 03:16:14.86
I mean, I am.

3606
03:16:14.86 --> 03:16:14.86
Yeah.

3607
03:16:14.86 --> 03:16:15.86
Very unclear.

3608
03:16:15.86 --> 03:16:19.86

03:17:24.86 --> 03:17:26.86
you want to vary up your workout.

3663
03:17:26.86 --> 03:17:28.86

03:17:30.86 --> 03:17:31.86

Chocolate, like, sparring workouts.

03:17:32.86 --> 03:17:33.86
That's cool too.

3669
03:17:33.86 --> 03:17:36.86
But if you want to make more interesting, get the mace.

3683
03:17:51.86 --> 03:17:52.86

3699
03:18:16.86 --> 03:18:19.86
I just learned what Spotify was.

3700
03:18:19.86 --> 03:18:20.86
Me too.

3701
03:18:20.86 --> 03:18:21.86
I'm not even known.

3702
03:18:21.86 --> 03:18:22.86
I'm not sure.

3703
03:18:22.86 --> 03:18:23.86
I know what it is.

3704
03:18:23.86 --> 03:18:24.86
Yeah.

3705
03:18:24.86 --> 03:18:25.86
Some kind of music feed thing.

3706
03:18:25.86 --> 03:18:26.86
But we're on it.

3707
03:18:26.86 --> 03:18:27.86
Yeah.

3708
03:18:27.86 --> 03:18:28.86
We're also on Alexa.

3709
03:18:28.86 --> 03:18:29.86
You have Alexa.

3710
03:18:29.86 --> 03:18:30.86
Never heard of her.

3711
03:18:30.86 --> 03:18:31.86
Okay.

3712
03:18:31.86 --> 03:18:32.86
Well, Amazon.

3713
03:18:32.86 --> 03:18:33.86
She's a cool.

3714
03:18:33.86 --> 03:18:34.86
Oh.

3715
03:18:34.86 --> 03:18:37.86
Well, you can ask it to play jockel podcast.

3716
03:18:37.86 --> 03:18:38.86
No way.

3717
03:18:38.86 --> 03:18:39.86
Yeah.

3718
03:18:39.86 --> 03:18:40.86
I'm going to buy one just for that.

3719
03:18:40.86 --> 03:18:42.86
It's like Alexa play jockel podcast.

3720
03:18:42.86 --> 03:18:46.86
And then it says, playing the latest episode of jockel podcast.

3721
03:18:46.86 --> 03:18:47.86
Yeah.

3722
03:18:47.86 --> 03:18:48.86
Can you go?

3723
03:18:48.86 --> 03:18:49.86
Yeah.

3724
03:18:49.86 --> 03:18:50.86
What's that?

3725
03:18:50.86 --> 03:18:51.86
So cool.

3726
03:18:51.86 --> 03:18:53.86
And you always say, do you have Alexa?

3727
03:18:53.86 --> 03:18:55.86
That's like saying, hey, do you have or.

3728
03:18:55.86 --> 03:18:57.86
You should go buy a Siri.

3729
03:18:57.86 --> 03:18:58.86
You can't buy Siri.

3730
03:18:58.86 --> 03:18:59.86
Siri comes with your phone.

3731
03:18:59.86 --> 03:19:00.86
No, no, no.

3732
03:19:00.86 --> 03:19:01.86
No.

3733
03:19:01.86 --> 03:19:02.86
You can buy Alexa.

3734
03:19:02.86 --> 03:19:03.86
No.

3735
03:19:03.86 --> 03:19:04.86
Yes.

3736
03:19:04.86 --> 03:19:05.86
Can not buy an Alexa.

3737
03:19:05.86 --> 03:19:06.86
You buy an Amazon.

3738
03:19:06.86 --> 03:19:07.86
No.

3739
03:19:07.86 --> 03:19:08.86
No.

3740
03:19:08.86 --> 03:19:08.86
No one calls it that.

3741
03:19:08.86 --> 03:19:09.86
No one talks about that.

3742
03:19:09.86 --> 03:19:11.86
Maybe they should because that's the correct thing.

3743
03:19:11.86 --> 03:19:12.86
We don't want to confuse people.

3744
03:19:12.86 --> 03:19:13.86
No.

3745
03:19:13.86 --> 03:19:14.86
You do want to confuse you.

3746
03:19:14.86 --> 03:19:15.86
No, no, no.

3747
03:19:15.86 --> 03:19:16.86
You do want to confuse people.

3748
03:19:16.86 --> 03:19:17.86
I'm talking about Alexa.

3749
03:19:17.86 --> 03:19:18.86
I know that.

3750
03:19:18.86 --> 03:19:19.86
I'm trying to.

3751
03:19:19.86 --> 03:19:20.86
I'm trying to.

3752
03:19:20.86 --> 03:19:21.86
All right.

3753
03:19:21.86 --> 03:19:22.86
If you're going to do it on this.

3754
03:19:22.86 --> 03:19:23.86
I'm going to.

3755
03:19:23.86 --> 03:19:25.86
It's a tube.

3756
03:19:25.86 --> 03:19:26.86
An intelligent tube.

3757
03:19:26.86 --> 03:19:27.86
Why does it have to be on not you?

3758
03:19:27.86 --> 03:19:28.86
Yeah.

3759
03:19:28.86 --> 03:19:29.86
That's what it comes down to.

3760
03:19:29.86 --> 03:19:30.86
It's.

3761
03:19:30.86 --> 03:19:31.86
He's man.

3762
03:19:31.86 --> 03:19:32.86
It's not his.

3763
03:19:32.86 --> 03:19:33.86
He's that.

3764
03:19:33.86 --> 03:19:34.86
That's what it is.

3765
03:19:34.86 --> 03:19:35.86
I'm going to look.

3766
03:19:35.86 --> 03:19:37.86
I'm going to give him a little.

3767
03:19:37.86 --> 03:19:38.86
Give him a little.

3768
03:19:38.86 --> 03:19:40.86
Because get that Amazon echo.

3769
03:19:40.86 --> 03:19:41.86
Yeah.

3770
03:19:41.86 --> 03:19:43.86
And then you ask Alexa.

3771
03:19:43.86 --> 03:19:45.86
So essentially, Alexa's an in the phone.

3772
03:19:45.86 --> 03:19:46.86
What if I want to ask?

3773
03:19:46.86 --> 03:19:47.86
I won't.

3774
03:19:47.86 --> 03:19:48.86
It won't respond.

3775
03:19:48.86 --> 03:19:50.86
You can call me up whenever I want to respond.

3776
03:19:50.86 --> 03:19:52.86
Amazon echo will not respond to the net.

3777
03:19:52.86 --> 03:19:53.86
I can call me up.

3778
03:19:53.86 --> 03:19:54.86
Alexa lives in Amazon echo.

3779
03:19:54.86 --> 03:19:56.86
Just like Siri lives in your iPhone.

3780
03:19:56.86 --> 03:19:58.86
There's nothing living in my iPhone.

3781
03:19:58.86 --> 03:19:59.86
It's a machine.

3782
03:19:59.86 --> 03:20:00.86
It's artificial.

3783
03:20:00.86 --> 03:20:02.86
Like, Galatians.

Also, Jaco is a store.

3793
03:20:20.86 --> 03:20:23.86
It's called Jaco store.

3794
03:20:23.86 --> 03:20:25.86
It's called Jaco podcast.

3795
03:20:25.86 --> 03:20:26.86

3796
03:20:26.86 --> 03:20:27.86
Because it's store.

I like it.

3798
03:20:28.86 --> 03:20:29.86
It's called Jaco.

3799
03:20:29.86 --> 03:20:30.86
I like it.

3800
03:20:30.86 --> 03:20:31.86
I'm not that creative.

3801
03:20:31.86 --> 03:20:34.86
If I had a bad as name like Jaco.

3802
03:20:34.86 --> 03:20:35.86
Your name is Dakota.

3803
03:20:35.86 --> 03:20:36.86
Come on now.

3804
03:20:36.86 --> 03:20:37.86
I know.

3805
03:20:37.86 --> 03:20:38.86
Everybody thinks it's like a girl though.

3806
03:20:38.86 --> 03:20:39.86
Oh, really?

3807
03:20:39.86 --> 03:20:40.86
Is it girls named Dakota?

3808
03:20:40.86 --> 03:20:41.86
Yeah, Dakota fanning.

3809
03:20:41.86 --> 03:20:42.86
Oh.

3810
03:20:42.86 --> 03:20:44.86
I like, like, I pick up the phone and are like,

3811
03:20:44.86 --> 03:20:46.86
man, I'm like, no.

3812
03:20:46.86 --> 03:20:49.86
I didn't even know there's a girls named Dakota.

3813
03:20:49.86 --> 03:20:50.86
Yeah.

3814
03:20:50.86 --> 03:20:51.86
Well, yeah.

3815
03:20:51.86 --> 03:20:52.86
Sorry, man.

3816
03:20:52.86 --> 03:20:53.86
That sucks.

3817
03:20:53.86 --> 03:20:54.86
Do you like a girl named Sue?

3818
03:20:54.86 --> 03:20:55.86
Is that why you turned out so bad at it?

3819
03:20:55.86 --> 03:20:56.86
Yeah.

3820
03:20:56.86 --> 03:20:57.86
Yeah.

3821
03:20:57.86 --> 03:20:59.86
That is awesome.

3822
03:20:59.86 --> 03:21:00.86
Like Jaco.

3823
03:21:00.86 --> 03:21:01.86
There you go.

3824
03:21:01.86 --> 03:21:05.86
I kind of feel like when it came done to Jaco to name his own store and stuff, he was all cool.

3825
03:21:05.86 --> 03:21:09.86
But when Amazon names their thing echo, it's like, you know, you guys could see.

3826
03:21:09.86 --> 03:21:10.86
You know, see a little bit.

3827
03:21:10.86 --> 03:21:11.86
See?

3828
03:21:11.86 --> 03:21:13.86
No, I was on your team.

3829
03:21:13.86 --> 03:21:14.86
No, no.

3830
03:21:14.86 --> 03:21:15.86
You kind of called it.

3831
03:21:15.86 --> 03:21:16.86
Remember?

3832
03:21:16.86 --> 03:21:17.86
Yeah.

3833
03:21:17.86 --> 03:21:18.86
At that moment.

3834
03:21:18.86 --> 03:21:19.86
You're going to get either way.

3835
03:21:19.86 --> 03:21:20.86
Jaco store.com.

3836
03:21:20.86 --> 03:21:22.86
This is where you can get shirts, dysmonyco's freedom.

3837
03:21:22.86 --> 03:21:23.86
Good shirt.

3838
03:21:23.86 --> 03:21:24.86
The good shirt.

3839
03:21:24.86 --> 03:21:27.86
And when I say the good shirt, it's the shirt with Jaco's head on it.

3840
03:21:27.86 --> 03:21:28.86
Says good backwards.

3841
03:21:28.86 --> 03:21:31.86
So when you look in the mirror, he's telling you good, you know.

3842
03:21:31.86 --> 03:21:32.86
I like that.

3843
03:21:32.86 --> 03:21:33.86
It's pretty good.

3844
03:21:33.86 --> 03:21:34.86
I'm going to get one.

3845
03:21:34.86 --> 03:21:35.86
Yeah.

3846
03:21:35.86 --> 03:21:36.86
I got you.

3847
03:21:36.86 --> 03:21:37.86
I got you.

3848
03:21:37.86 --> 03:21:38.86
I got you too.

3849
03:21:38.86 --> 03:21:39.86
Alexa will take care of you.

3850
03:21:39.86 --> 03:21:40.86
Sorry.

3851
03:21:40.86 --> 03:21:43.86
Makes sense of the job.

3852
03:21:43.86 --> 03:21:44.86
All right.

3853
03:21:44.86 --> 03:21:47.86
Nonetheless, Jaco's daughter kind of is some rash cards on there,

3854
03:21:47.86 --> 03:21:49.86
some hoodies, some hats, patches.

3855
03:21:49.86 --> 03:21:50.86
I got to restock the patches.

3856
03:21:50.86 --> 03:21:52.86
I restock everything on there.

3857
03:21:52.86 --> 03:21:53.86
Got the patches.

3858
03:21:53.86 --> 03:21:54.86
Yeah.

3859
03:21:54.86 --> 03:21:55.86
He looks, I'm trying.

3860
03:21:55.86 --> 03:21:56.86
I'm here.

3861
03:21:56.86 --> 03:21:58.86
Um, women's assistant.

3862
03:21:58.86 --> 03:21:59.86
And there's a system in place now.

3863
03:21:59.86 --> 03:22:00.86
The restock automatically.

3864
03:22:00.86 --> 03:22:01.86
Am I correct?

3865
03:22:01.86 --> 03:22:02.86
I, well.

3866
03:22:02.86 --> 03:22:02.86
Okay.

3867
03:22:02.86 --> 03:22:03.86
I'm not correct.

3868
03:22:03.86 --> 03:22:03.86
Okay.

3869
03:22:03.86 --> 03:22:04.86
Forget it.

3870
03:22:04.86 --> 03:22:06.86
Depends on what you mean, but automatically.

3871
03:22:06.86 --> 03:22:08.86
I just mean things will be in stock from now on.

3872
03:22:08.86 --> 03:22:09.86
That's what I mean.

3873
03:22:09.86 --> 03:22:10.86
We'll just say more often.

3874
03:22:10.86 --> 03:22:11.86
Bro.

3875
03:22:11.86 --> 03:22:12.86
We'll just say better.

3876
03:22:12.86 --> 03:22:14.86
You had one job.

3877
03:22:14.86 --> 03:22:15.86
You had one.

3878
03:22:15.86 --> 03:22:16.86
You had one.

3879
03:22:16.86 --> 03:22:17.86
You had one.

3880
03:22:17.86 --> 03:22:18.86
Okay.

3881
03:22:18.86 --> 03:22:19.86
You know what?

3882
03:22:19.86 --> 03:22:20.86
Forget it.

3883
03:22:20.86 --> 03:22:21.86
Actually, he's got two jobs.

3884
03:22:21.86 --> 03:22:22.86
Make videos and keep the store stock.

3885
03:22:22.86 --> 03:22:23.86
Yeah.

3886
03:22:23.86 --> 03:22:24.86
How's he doing?

3887
03:22:24.86 --> 03:22:25.86
Well, for two.

3888
03:22:25.86 --> 03:22:27.86
You like it?

3889
03:22:27.86 --> 03:22:28.86
You like it?

3890
03:22:28.86 --> 03:22:29.86
You guys don't find that?

3891
03:22:29.86 --> 03:22:30.86
Okay.

3892
03:22:30.86 --> 03:22:31.86
Yeah.

3893
03:22:31.86 --> 03:22:32.86
Jaco's daughter.com.

3894
03:22:32.86 --> 03:22:33.86
That's the website.

3895
03:22:33.86 --> 03:22:35.86
Anyway, I'm not saying goodbye something.

3896
03:22:35.86 --> 03:22:36.86
I'm saying look, check it out.

3897
03:22:36.86 --> 03:22:39.86
If you want something, get something.

3898
03:22:39.86 --> 03:22:40.86
Good way to support.

3899
03:22:40.86 --> 03:22:41.86
Also.

3900
03:22:41.86 --> 03:22:42.86
Good way to support.

3901
03:22:42.86 --> 03:22:43.86
Psychological Warfare.

3902
03:22:43.86 --> 03:22:44.86
Support yourself.

3903
03:22:44.86 --> 03:22:45.86
I'm paying.

3904
03:22:45.86 --> 03:22:47.86
We call it a campaign against weakness.

3905
03:22:47.86 --> 03:22:48.86
Makes sense.

3906
03:22:48.86 --> 03:22:49.86
Yeah, like it.

3907
03:22:49.86 --> 03:22:50.86
Yeah.

3908
03:22:50.86 --> 03:22:51.86
We liked it too.

3909
03:22:51.86 --> 03:22:54.86
So it was suggested to us.

3910
03:22:54.86 --> 03:22:56.86
You know, those days where you kind of don't feel like it.

3911
03:22:56.86 --> 03:22:57.86
Right?

3912
03:22:57.86 --> 03:23:02.86
And who better to ask for a little assist on those days than Jaco?

3913
03:23:02.86 --> 03:23:03.86
Right?

3914
03:23:03.86 --> 03:23:04.86
In theory.

3915
03:23:04.86 --> 03:23:05.86
Good.

3916
03:23:05.86 --> 03:23:06.86
I mean, I agree.

3917
03:23:06.86 --> 03:23:07.86
So boom.

3918
03:23:07.86 --> 03:23:09.86
Now we have this album with tracks.

3919
03:23:09.86 --> 03:23:10.86
Jaco tracks.

3920
03:23:10.86 --> 03:23:15.86
Telling you to get how to get past moments of weakness that may come up.

3921
03:23:15.86 --> 03:23:19.86
Waking up early, skipping workouts, you know, diets, stuff on it.

3922
03:23:19.86 --> 03:23:20.86
Works pretty good.

3923
03:23:20.86 --> 03:23:21.86
That's bad ass.

3924
03:23:21.86 --> 03:23:22.86
10 for 10 results.

3925
03:23:22.86 --> 03:23:24.86
You'll never skip a workout.

3926
03:23:24.86 --> 03:23:25.86
Sorry, I made this.

3927
03:23:25.86 --> 03:23:26.86
Jaco is like asked me.

3928
03:23:26.86 --> 03:23:29.86
Asked me a question one time like, why do you not step?

3929
03:23:29.86 --> 03:23:30.86
How do you not skip workouts?

3930
03:23:30.86 --> 03:23:31.86
And I was like, oh, just mobile phone.

3931
03:23:31.86 --> 03:23:33.86
Yeah, you don't feel like.

3932
03:23:33.86 --> 03:23:34.86
Yeah.

3933
03:23:34.86 --> 03:23:35.86
And he's like, dude, I need to record that.

3934
03:23:35.86 --> 03:23:38.86
And then he just like asked me a bunch of random questions.

3935
03:23:38.86 --> 03:23:40.86
And then we made it in a recording.

3936
03:23:40.86 --> 03:23:42.86
And we put it on iTunes for sale.

3937
03:23:42.86 --> 03:23:49.86
It was the number one spoken word on iTunes for I think.

3938
03:23:49.86 --> 03:23:52.86
I think until you're, I think 11 months.

3939
03:23:52.86 --> 03:23:57.86
It finally got knocked out of number one spoken word by when I released this book,

3940
03:23:57.86 --> 03:24:03.86
this one equals freedom field manual on iTunes as a spoken word album.

3941
03:24:03.86 --> 03:24:05.86
So I'm just saying.

3942
03:24:05.86 --> 03:24:06.86
It's like so random.

3943
03:24:06.86 --> 03:24:08.86
Yeah, it's not him.

3944
03:24:08.86 --> 03:24:09.86
So I don't want to do this.

3945
03:24:09.86 --> 03:24:10.86
No, I just talk.

3946
03:24:10.86 --> 03:24:11.86
I'm not a healer.

3947
03:24:11.86 --> 03:24:13.86
Yeah, you don't have to.

3948
03:24:13.86 --> 03:24:14.86
Yeah.

3949
03:24:14.86 --> 03:24:15.86
You don't have to.

3950
03:24:15.86 --> 03:24:17.86
I still tell the guys, hey, I mean, obviously, you got a yell on the battlefield.

3951
03:24:17.86 --> 03:24:18.86
And you got a yell.

3952
03:24:18.86 --> 03:24:19.86
People, because so they can hear you.

3953
03:24:19.86 --> 03:24:20.86
That's one thing.

3954
03:24:20.86 --> 03:24:23.86
But yeah, I mean, I was just tell guys, if you have to yell at someone,

3955
03:24:23.86 --> 03:24:25.86
and you really screwed some up as a leery.

3956
03:24:25.86 --> 03:24:26.86
Yeah.

3957
03:24:26.86 --> 03:24:27.86
If I got a yell at you.

3958
03:24:27.86 --> 03:24:28.86
Or if I had to be like,

3959
03:24:28.86 --> 03:24:29.86
You think.

3960
03:24:29.86 --> 03:24:30.86
Yeah.

3961
03:24:30.86 --> 03:24:33.86
Nonetheless, it's, yeah, very, very, like, if you,

3962
03:24:33.86 --> 03:24:36.86
you're like, you'll be like, oh, there.

3963
03:24:36.86 --> 03:24:38.86
This is someone called Sugarcoded Lies.

3964
03:24:38.86 --> 03:24:39.86
Right.

3965
03:24:39.86 --> 03:24:42.86
And it's about like, you know how like when you're at work.

3966
03:24:42.86 --> 03:24:44.86
You were talking about the good video.

3967
03:24:44.86 --> 03:24:44.86
Yeah.

3968
03:24:44.86 --> 03:24:45.86
Right.

3969
03:24:45.86 --> 03:24:47.86
So this is the same thing, but it's like a track you can get.

3970
03:24:47.86 --> 03:24:48.86
You can get actually this.

3971
03:24:48.86 --> 03:24:49.86
The, the, the, the, the, just when it goes free,

3972
03:24:49.86 --> 03:24:52.86
I'm field manual album has good on there as a track.

3973
03:24:52.86 --> 03:24:53.86
Just a track boom.

3974
03:24:53.86 --> 03:24:54.86
There you go.

3975
03:24:54.86 --> 03:24:55.86
So you can put it in your whatever.

3976
03:24:55.86 --> 03:24:55.86
Yeah.

3977
03:24:55.86 --> 03:24:56.86
You can say.

3978
03:24:56.86 --> 03:24:58.86
So, and because I had people going, you should make an alarm clock.

3979
03:24:58.86 --> 03:24:59.86
You should make an alarm clock.

3980
03:24:59.86 --> 03:25:00.86
So when you did the album with tracks,

3981
03:25:00.86 --> 03:25:02.86
and when you could use that thing as an alarm clock.

3982
03:25:02.86 --> 03:25:03.86
So when people ask me for alarm clock,

3983
03:25:03.86 --> 03:25:04.86
and like, go get the albums.

3984
03:25:04.86 --> 03:25:05.86
There's three albums down.

3985
03:25:05.86 --> 03:25:06.86
Yeah.

3986
03:25:06.86 --> 03:25:07.86
By the way, three albums.

3987
03:25:07.86 --> 03:25:07.86
Yeah.

3988
03:25:07.86 --> 03:25:08.86
Psychological warfare.

3989
03:25:08.86 --> 03:25:10.86
And this one is in two different albums.

3990
03:25:10.86 --> 03:25:13.86
You really only need the first album of Dispanical Freedom Field Manual.

3991
03:25:13.86 --> 03:25:14.86
For this.

3992
03:25:14.86 --> 03:25:15.86
For the audio.

3993
03:25:15.86 --> 03:25:16.86
Yeah.

3994
03:25:16.86 --> 03:25:17.86
You can get it.

3995
03:25:17.86 --> 03:25:19.86
Well, there's, well, if you want the knowledge parts.

3996
03:25:19.86 --> 03:25:20.86
Yeah.

3997
03:25:20.86 --> 03:25:21.86
That's the second video.

3998
03:25:21.86 --> 03:25:22.86
The second album.

3999
03:25:22.86 --> 03:25:23.86
Yeah.

4000
03:25:23.86 --> 03:25:24.86
You didn't know I was over here.

4001
03:25:24.86 --> 03:25:26.86
So this is where this is where Echo started hammer hammer.

4002
03:25:26.86 --> 03:25:28.86
Maybe because, you know, when they list you,

4003
03:25:28.86 --> 03:25:30.86
they list like psychological warfare.

4004
03:25:30.86 --> 03:25:31.86
And then they have to list who made it.

4005
03:25:31.86 --> 03:25:33.86
And it was artist,

4006
03:25:33.86 --> 03:25:35.86
Jockel really knows.

4007
03:25:35.86 --> 03:25:36.86
No, no, no, no.

4008
03:25:36.86 --> 03:25:37.86
I'm not an artist.

4009
03:25:37.86 --> 03:25:39.86
I'm just, I'm just speaking.

4010
03:25:39.86 --> 03:25:40.86
I'm just saying words.

4011
03:25:40.86 --> 03:25:41.86
That's not art.

4012
03:25:41.86 --> 03:25:41.86
No.

4013
03:25:41.86 --> 03:25:42.86
Is that no, no, no, no.

4014
03:25:42.86 --> 03:25:43.86
You're an artist.

4015
03:25:43.86 --> 03:25:43.86
Yeah.

4016
03:25:43.86 --> 03:25:45.86
So you didn't know that man.

4017
03:25:45.86 --> 03:25:49.86
I never, I never looked at you and said,

4018
03:25:49.86 --> 03:25:49.86
Wow.

03:25:52.86 --> 03:25:52.86
Art see guy.

4023
03:25:52.86 --> 03:25:53.86
None of the less.

4024
03:25:53.86 --> 03:25:54.86
Very effective.

4025
03:25:54.86 --> 03:25:55.86
Very effective.

4026
03:25:55.86 --> 03:25:56.86
Very effective.

4027
03:25:56.86 --> 03:25:58.86
The way to support two by the way.

4028
03:25:58.86 --> 03:25:58.86

4029
03:25:58.86 --> 03:25:59.86

03:26:46.86 --> 03:26:47.86
We.

4063
03:26:47.86 --> 03:26:49.86
I covered less than 10% of the book today.

4064
03:26:49.86 --> 03:26:54.86

03:26:54.86 --> 03:26:55.86
Get the book.

4066
03:26:55.86 --> 03:26:56.86
Support the podcast.

03:26:56.86 --> 03:26:57.86

Learn about.

4069
03:26:58.86 --> 03:27:05.86
What these brave Americans in half-games went through.

4070
03:27:05.86 --> 03:27:08.86
Way the warrior kid.

4071
03:27:08.86 --> 03:27:09.86
There's a book.

4072
03:27:09.86 --> 03:27:10.86
I wrote for kids.

4073
03:27:10.86 --> 03:27:11.86
Why?

4074
03:27:11.86 --> 03:27:12.86
Because who's what kind of kids?

4075
03:27:12.86 --> 03:27:14.86
What kind of books were kids reading?

4076
03:27:14.86 --> 03:27:15.86
I know because I got four kids.

4077
03:27:15.86 --> 03:27:21.86
My kids were reading books about lame people that were being encouraged to be weak.

4078
03:27:21.86 --> 03:27:22.86
Yeah.

4079
03:27:22.86 --> 03:27:27.86
Instead of like, hey, you know what it's okay to actually get after it and try and be smarter and try and be stronger.

4080
03:27:27.86 --> 03:27:37.86
So if you want your kid to be smarter and stronger and eat healthier and work harder, if that's what you want, you get the kid way the warrior kid.

4081
03:27:37.86 --> 03:27:43.86
If you want to make your child weak and undisciplined, that's cool.

4082
03:27:43.86 --> 03:27:47.86
You can buy any other book for a kid and that's what you get.

4083
03:27:47.86 --> 03:27:52.86
And that book did good with people.

4084
03:27:52.86 --> 03:27:54.86
And I wrote another one.

4085
03:27:54.86 --> 03:27:58.86
It's called Way the Warrior Kid to it's called Mark's Mission.

4086
03:27:58.86 --> 03:28:06.86
And it's got a whole new genre of issues that Mark has to face with his Uncle Jake Uncle Jake comes to help out young Mark.

4087
03:28:06.86 --> 03:28:08.86
Would you call him more advanced issues?

4088
03:28:08.86 --> 03:28:09.86
They are slightly more advanced.

4089
03:28:09.86 --> 03:28:10.86
Let me tell you which one of them.

4090
03:28:10.86 --> 03:28:14.86
One of the one of the issues that young Mark's will marks in sixth grade now in book two.

4091
03:28:14.86 --> 03:28:17.86
He loses his temper sometimes.

4092
03:28:17.86 --> 03:28:22.86
And he gets in trouble at school for hucking a paper, mishay pumpkin.

4093
03:28:22.86 --> 03:28:24.86
And another kid's head.

4094
03:28:24.86 --> 03:28:27.86
And it deflects off his head and hits the teacher in the face.

4095
03:28:27.86 --> 03:28:28.86
Oh man.

4096
03:28:28.86 --> 03:28:31.86
He gets sent home from school last day at school.

4097
03:28:31.86 --> 03:28:33.86
Anyways, he has someone to control his temper.

4098
03:28:33.86 --> 03:28:34.86
Just like all kids do.

4099
03:28:34.86 --> 03:28:35.86
And I know this because I got kids.

4100
03:28:35.86 --> 03:28:36.86
And I know this because I was a kid.

4101
03:28:36.86 --> 03:28:39.86
And you remember when you were a little kid and you lived your temper and you did your job.

4102
03:28:39.86 --> 03:28:40.86
I'm stuff evil.

4103
03:28:40.86 --> 03:28:42.86
And when I say little kid, I'm talking like 23 years old.

4104
03:28:42.86 --> 03:28:44.86
I was like, sure.

4105
03:28:44.86 --> 03:28:45.86
I was like, say.

4106
03:28:45.86 --> 03:28:47.86
Yeah, I do.

4107
03:28:47.86 --> 03:28:49.86
You know what I'm talking about.

4108
03:28:49.86 --> 03:28:52.86
That's what I got to get you a copy.

4109
03:28:52.86 --> 03:28:55.86
His uncle in the book is a seal.

4110
03:28:55.86 --> 03:28:56.86
It was a seal.

4111
03:28:56.86 --> 03:28:59.86
And he comes to stay with him for the summer and helps him.

4112
03:28:59.86 --> 03:29:00.86
Square way these little problems.

4113
03:29:00.86 --> 03:29:01.86
He's a kid.

4114
03:29:01.86 --> 03:29:02.86
Yeah.

4115
03:29:02.86 --> 03:29:03.86
So that's what that was about.

4116
03:29:03.86 --> 03:29:05.86
He also learns about working hard.

4117
03:29:05.86 --> 03:29:06.86
He gets a job.

4118
03:29:06.86 --> 03:29:07.86
Starts a business.

4119
03:29:07.86 --> 03:29:10.86
He's 11 years old.

4120
03:29:10.86 --> 03:29:11.86
Has his own business.

4121
03:29:11.86 --> 03:29:13.86
Mowing lawns and pulling weeds.

4122
03:29:13.86 --> 03:29:16.86
That's way the warrior kid.

4123
03:29:16.86 --> 03:29:19.86
And way the warrior kid to marks mission.

4124
03:29:19.86 --> 03:29:24.86
You can also get speaking of which warrior kids from Irish Oaks Ranch.

4125
03:29:24.86 --> 03:29:28.86
There's a young warrior kid 12 years old business owner.

03:29:28.86 --> 03:29:33.86
He makes soap from goat milk right here in California on his farm.

4180
03:30:57.86 --> 03:30:58.86
Yeah.

4181
03:30:58.86 --> 03:30:59.86
Right.

4182
03:30:59.86 --> 03:31:01.86
I was like smearing boogers on my sisters.

4183
03:31:01.86 --> 03:31:02.86
I was still a nerd.

4184
03:31:02.86 --> 03:31:03.86
You know what I'm saying?

4185
03:31:03.86 --> 03:31:04.86
I was waiting there.

4186
03:31:04.86 --> 03:31:05.86
We're just talking loser.

4187
03:31:05.86 --> 03:31:06.86
I mean, I was eating dirt.

4188
03:31:06.86 --> 03:31:08.86
I didn't know it's so put.

4189
03:31:08.86 --> 03:31:11.86
I was like, I was doing, I thought I was eating dirt.

4190
03:31:11.86 --> 03:31:12.86
Yeah.

4191
03:31:12.86 --> 03:31:14.86
I made up the slogan too.

4192
03:31:14.86 --> 03:31:16.86
Simple slogan.

4193
03:31:16.86 --> 03:31:17.86
Simple slogan.

4194
03:31:17.86 --> 03:31:18.86
Yeah.

4195
03:31:18.86 --> 03:31:19.86
And it's actually great slogan.

4196
03:31:19.86 --> 03:31:20.86
You know what it is.

4197
03:31:20.86 --> 03:31:21.86
Jocco soap.

4198
03:31:21.86 --> 03:31:22.86
Stay clean.

4199
03:31:22.86 --> 03:31:23.86
Oh.

4200
03:31:23.86 --> 03:31:24.86
You got it.

4201
03:31:24.86 --> 03:31:25.86
You got it.

4202
03:31:25.86 --> 03:31:26.86
You got it.

4203
03:31:26.86 --> 03:31:27.86
I mean, you got it with me.

4204
03:31:27.86 --> 03:31:28.86
I got to tell you.

4205
03:31:28.86 --> 03:31:29.86
You got it with me.

4206
03:31:29.86 --> 03:31:30.86
It's good.

4207
03:31:30.86 --> 03:31:31.86
It's good.

4208
03:31:31.86 --> 03:31:32.86
It's good.

4209
03:31:32.86 --> 03:31:33.86
I don't know.

4210
03:31:33.86 --> 03:31:35.86
I don't know how you came up with that.

4211
03:31:35.86 --> 03:31:36.86
Telling your.

4212
03:31:36.86 --> 03:31:37.86
Jocco soap.

4213
03:31:37.86 --> 03:31:37.86
Stay clean.

4214
03:31:37.86 --> 03:31:38.86
Right?

4215
03:31:38.86 --> 03:31:39.86
Man.

4216
03:31:39.86 --> 03:31:39.86
Same way.

4217
03:31:39.86 --> 03:31:41.86
You came up with Jocco store.

4218
03:31:41.86 --> 03:31:42.86
Yeah.

4219
03:31:42.86 --> 03:31:43.86
Jocco store.

4220
03:31:43.86 --> 03:31:46.86
Real unreligative when it comes to them.

4221
03:31:46.86 --> 03:31:47.86
Them names.

4222
03:31:47.86 --> 03:31:48.86
Also, hey, another book.

4223
03:31:48.86 --> 03:31:51.86
This one is for you to feel manual.

4224
03:31:51.86 --> 03:31:53.86
If you need to get on the path, stay on the path.

4225
03:31:53.86 --> 03:31:54.86
Be on the path.

4226
03:31:54.86 --> 03:31:56.86
Move further down the path.

4227
03:31:56.86 --> 03:31:59.86
If you're having trouble getting after it in life, get the book.

4228
03:31:59.86 --> 03:32:01.86
This one equals for you to feel manual.

4229
03:32:01.86 --> 03:32:03.86
And then don't just get the book and read it.

4230
03:32:03.86 --> 03:32:05.86
You have to actually do something.

4231
03:32:05.86 --> 03:32:06.86
That's in it.

4232
03:32:06.86 --> 03:32:07.86
But it's pretty clear.

4233
03:32:07.86 --> 03:32:08.86
It's a field manual.

4234
03:32:08.86 --> 03:32:11.86
Echo claims to know all about field manuals.

4235
03:32:11.86 --> 03:32:12.86
My favorite kind of manual.

4236
03:32:12.86 --> 03:32:13.86
Yeah.

4237
03:32:13.86 --> 03:32:15.86
You actually know about field manuals.

4238
03:32:15.86 --> 03:32:18.86
Go into field manual that tells you how to get after it.

4239
03:32:18.86 --> 03:32:19.86
So you can do that.

4240
03:32:19.86 --> 03:32:23.86
The audio version of that is not on audible.

4241
03:32:23.86 --> 03:32:25.86
You can't find it there.

4242
03:32:25.86 --> 03:32:26.86
Why?

4243
03:32:26.86 --> 03:32:29.86
Because you couldn't cut it up into tracks, which is what you all asked for.

4244
03:32:29.86 --> 03:32:35.86
It is on Amazon Music, Google Play, iTunes as an MP3.

4245
03:32:35.86 --> 03:32:38.86
Also, extreme ownership.

4246
03:32:38.86 --> 03:32:40.86
The book that Lave Babin and I wrote.

4247
03:32:40.86 --> 03:32:43.86
That's about combat leadership.

4248
03:32:43.86 --> 03:32:47.86
Some of it actually every topic that we talked about today when it came to leadership

4249
03:32:47.86 --> 03:32:48.86
and organizational issues.

4250
03:32:48.86 --> 03:32:51.86
It's all things that are inside extreme ownership.

4251
03:32:51.86 --> 03:32:52.86
Get that.

4252
03:32:52.86 --> 03:32:54.86
And it's not just about war, but it's about life.

4253
03:32:54.86 --> 03:32:56.86
It's about business.

4254
03:32:56.86 --> 03:32:59.86
And on top of that, we have a leadership and management consulting company.

4255
03:32:59.86 --> 03:33:01.86
It's called Ashland on Front.

4256
03:33:01.86 --> 03:33:04.86
We solve problems through leadership.

4257
03:33:04.86 --> 03:33:10.86
Every problem that any organization has can be solved through one thing and one thing only

4258
03:33:10.86 --> 03:33:11.86
leadership.

4259
03:33:11.86 --> 03:33:13.86
That's it.

4260
03:33:13.86 --> 03:33:17.86
So if you got problems, call us Ashland Front.

4261
03:33:17.86 --> 03:33:22.86
Me, Lave Babin, J.P.Denel, Dave Burke.

4262
03:33:22.86 --> 03:33:24.86
Ashlandfront.com.

4263
03:33:24.86 --> 03:33:27.86
Of course, also we have the master.

4264
03:33:27.86 --> 03:33:30.86
It's a leadership gathering.

4265
03:33:30.86 --> 03:33:32.86
It's a leadership gathering.

4266
03:33:32.86 --> 03:33:37.86
Seminar, conference gathering.

4267
03:33:37.86 --> 03:33:39.86
And that's what we do.

4268
03:33:39.86 --> 03:33:40.86
We get together.

4269
03:33:40.86 --> 03:33:42.86
We have all kinds of leaders come.

4270
03:33:42.86 --> 03:33:43.86
We present.

4271
03:33:43.86 --> 03:33:44.86
We talk about issues.

4272
03:33:44.86 --> 03:33:50.86
We give pragmatic, actual, tactics and techniques on how to lead people.

4273
03:33:50.86 --> 03:33:56.86
If you want to like come to a conference and get all happy and happy and make

4274
03:33:56.86 --> 03:34:01.86
hugging promises to the guy that's sitting next to you, don't come to this conference.

4275
03:34:01.86 --> 03:34:03.86
That's not what this conference is.

4276
03:34:03.86 --> 03:34:06.86
We're not singing and dancing at all.

4277
03:34:06.86 --> 03:34:08.86
We talk about how to lead.

4278
03:34:08.86 --> 03:34:09.86
That's what it is.

4279
03:34:09.86 --> 03:34:12.86
So if you want to learn how to lead, come to the master.

4280
03:34:12.86 --> 03:34:14.86
There's only two of them in 2018.

4281
03:34:14.86 --> 03:34:16.86
Only two of them.

4282
03:34:16.86 --> 03:34:19.86
One of them, Washington, DC, May 17th and 18th.

4283
03:34:19.86 --> 03:34:23.86
One of them, San Francisco, October 17th and 18th.

4284
03:34:23.86 --> 03:34:27.86
That's it.

4285
03:34:27.86 --> 03:34:29.86
We're not going to.

4286
03:34:29.86 --> 03:34:31.86
What's the name of your hometown?

4287
03:34:31.86 --> 03:34:33.86
We're not going to Columbia, Kentucky for the master.

4288
03:34:33.86 --> 03:34:37.86
We couldn't, we couldn't, your barn wasn't big enough to hold it in.

4289
03:34:37.86 --> 03:34:38.86
We can expand it.

4290
03:34:38.86 --> 03:34:39.86
Yeah.

4291
03:34:39.86 --> 03:34:40.86
I'll work on it for next year.

4292
03:34:40.86 --> 03:34:41.86
Work on it.

4293
03:34:41.86 --> 03:34:43.86
We actually did one.

4294
03:34:43.86 --> 03:34:45.86
If I know you at the time, you would have been there.

4295
03:34:45.86 --> 03:34:46.86
Yeah.

4296
03:34:46.86 --> 03:34:47.86
Awesome.

4297
03:34:47.86 --> 03:34:49.86
And let me know if you want to come to one of these.

4298
03:34:49.86 --> 03:34:51.86
But we're not doing it in Columbia, Kentucky.

4299
03:34:51.86 --> 03:34:55.86
Uh, we're not doing it in, what's another random place.

4300
03:34:55.86 --> 03:34:57.86
Oh, my, cool.

4301
03:34:57.86 --> 03:34:59.86
I'm not doing it in Hawaii.

4302
03:34:59.86 --> 03:35:01.86
If you want to come, you've got to come to one of those two.

4303
03:35:01.86 --> 03:35:04.86
Register, by the way, they've also, we've done for them.

4304
03:35:04.86 --> 03:35:08.86
They've also, this one's going to sell out to register to extremownership.com.

4305
03:35:08.86 --> 03:35:13.86
And we, okay, we raised the prices.

4306
03:35:13.86 --> 03:35:16.86
Once we hit a certain date, why do we do that?

4307
03:35:16.86 --> 03:35:17.86
Why do we raise the prices?

4308
03:35:17.86 --> 03:35:18.86
Once we hit a certain date.

4309
03:35:18.86 --> 03:35:19.86
To make my money?

4310
03:35:19.86 --> 03:35:20.86
No.

4311
03:35:20.86 --> 03:35:21.86
No.

4312
03:35:21.86 --> 03:35:31.86
We actually don't want people to do that because what, the, what reason we do is we want to incentivize people to register early so that we can block enough room, order enough food.

4313
03:35:31.86 --> 03:35:33.86
Plan plan correctly.

4314
03:35:33.86 --> 03:35:35.86
Get the venue set up the right way.

4315
03:35:35.86 --> 03:35:38.86
So we're, we're trying to make people come early.

4316
03:35:38.86 --> 03:35:40.86
So we, it's actually a penalty.

4317
03:35:40.86 --> 03:35:42.86
We're penalizing you for being slow.

4318
03:35:42.86 --> 03:35:44.86
Prefer procrastinating.

4319
03:35:44.86 --> 03:35:45.86
Yes.

4320
03:35:45.86 --> 03:35:46.86
Procrastination.

4321
03:35:46.86 --> 03:35:47.86
You're going to pay.

4322
03:35:47.86 --> 03:35:48.86
That's right.

4323
03:35:48.86 --> 03:35:49.86
Oh, it's a procrastination penalty.

4324
03:35:49.86 --> 03:35:50.86
That's good.

4325
03:35:50.86 --> 03:35:51.86
If you wait, you pay.

4326
03:35:51.86 --> 03:35:52.86
I'll take credit for that.

4327
03:35:52.86 --> 03:35:54.86
We like people that get out for them.

4328
03:35:54.86 --> 03:35:56.86
Don't put that as one of Jocos.

4329
03:35:56.86 --> 03:35:57.86
Okay.

4330
03:35:57.86 --> 03:35:58.86
You'll get credit.

4331
03:35:58.86 --> 03:35:59.86
You'll get credit.

4332
03:35:59.86 --> 03:36:00.86
I think.

4333
03:36:00.86 --> 03:36:01.86
You'll get a percentage.

4334
03:36:01.86 --> 03:36:04.86
Because you run it off my lead and I get a little cut.

4335
03:36:04.86 --> 03:36:05.86
I like it.

4336
03:36:05.86 --> 03:36:06.86
All right.

4337
03:36:06.86 --> 03:36:08.86
So that is that.

4338
03:36:08.86 --> 03:36:18.86
And until the monster, if you have questions or feedback for us, we are, we are ready to receive on the in the webs on Twitter on Instagram and on.

4339
03:36:18.86 --> 03:36:19.86
Dash.

4340
03:36:19.86 --> 03:36:20.86
Facebook.

4341
03:36:20.86 --> 03:36:21.86
I'm going to go.

4342
03:36:21.86 --> 03:36:28.86
Echoes at Echo Charles and I am at Jockel Willink and Dakota is on the interwebs in a big way.

4343
03:36:28.86 --> 03:36:30.86
In a big way.

4344
03:36:30.86 --> 03:36:34.86
On Twitter, at Dakota underscore Meyer.

4345
03:36:34.86 --> 03:36:36.86
That's how we linked up by the way via Twitter.

4346
03:36:36.86 --> 03:36:37.86
That is.

4347
03:36:37.86 --> 03:36:39.86
I can't believe you're responding to me.

4348
03:36:39.86 --> 03:36:43.86
And I'm like, I can't believe you said so for the week.

4349
03:36:43.86 --> 03:36:45.86
A couple little kids on Instagram.

4350
03:36:45.86 --> 03:36:49.86
Dakota Meyer.

4351
03:36:49.86 --> 03:36:51.86
Oh, three, seventeen.

4352
03:36:51.86 --> 03:36:53.86
Just my.

4353
03:36:53.86 --> 03:36:55.86
No, just a three, seventeen.

4354
03:36:55.86 --> 03:36:56.86
Dakota Meyer.

4355
03:36:56.86 --> 03:36:59.86
That's that's Instagram on Facebook.

4356
03:36:59.86 --> 03:37:01.86
Sergeant Dakota Meyer.

4357
03:37:01.86 --> 03:37:04.86
You can just look to go to Meyer and it pops right up.

4358
03:37:04.86 --> 03:37:06.86
Because you're kind of the man.

4359
03:37:06.86 --> 03:37:07.86
You have a podcast.

4360
03:37:07.86 --> 03:37:08.86
I do.

4361
03:37:08.86 --> 03:37:09.86
You have your own podcast.

4362
03:37:09.86 --> 03:37:11.86
It's called owning it.

4363
03:37:11.86 --> 03:37:12.86
Owning it.

4364
03:37:12.86 --> 03:37:13.86
With the codemire.

4365
03:37:13.86 --> 03:37:15.86
That's cool.

4366
03:37:15.86 --> 03:37:17.86
You have Dakota Meyer dot com is another place.

4367
03:37:17.86 --> 03:37:19.86
So like I said, that's why I said you're all over the interwebs.

4368
03:37:19.86 --> 03:37:21.86
Because clearly you are all over the interwebs.

4369
03:37:21.86 --> 03:37:22.86
You got a YouTube channel.

4370
03:37:22.86 --> 03:37:23.86
Yeah, I got a YouTube channel.

4371
03:37:23.86 --> 03:37:25.86
It's just Dakota Meyer.

4372
03:37:25.86 --> 03:37:27.86
So I've got the YouTube channel just Dakota Meyer.

4373
03:37:27.86 --> 03:37:30.86
When my podcast goes up, it's on own the dash.

4374
03:37:30.86 --> 03:37:31.86
Own the dash.

4375
03:37:31.86 --> 03:37:32.86
What does that mean?

4376
03:37:32.86 --> 03:37:34.86
Uh, so you know, own the dash comes from a point.

4377
03:37:34.86 --> 03:37:36.86
Lendelis had wrote called the dash.

4378
03:37:36.86 --> 03:37:42.86
And, uh, you know, I felt like I felt like people in America just needed something to hold on to.

4379
03:37:42.86 --> 03:37:45.86
And, uh, you know, so I always look at what is success.

4380
03:37:45.86 --> 03:37:46.86
And how do I want to be remembered?

4381
03:37:46.86 --> 03:37:48.86
And that's kind of like a big thing for me.

4382
03:37:48.86 --> 03:37:52.86
And I, uh, so Lendelis wrote an appointment talked about how I got a funeral.

4383
03:37:52.86 --> 03:37:55.86
You know, I'm man stood to speak and you referred to the dates.

4384
03:37:55.86 --> 03:37:57.86
You know, on the tombstone from the beginning.

4385
03:37:57.86 --> 03:38:00.86
You know, with the date, the person was born.

4386
03:38:00.86 --> 03:38:02.86
The day he died.

4387
03:38:02.86 --> 03:38:06.86
And really those are the two only two days in your life that you don't make any decisions.

4388
03:38:06.86 --> 03:38:08.86
Or have any control of.

4389
03:38:08.86 --> 03:38:11.86
And everything else, what matters that dash.

4390
03:38:11.86 --> 03:38:12.86
What matters that dash in between.

4391
03:38:12.86 --> 03:38:13.86
And so how are you going to own your dash?

4392
03:38:13.86 --> 03:38:15.86
What is your dash going to look like?

4393
03:38:15.86 --> 03:38:16.86
Because you can control that.

4394
03:38:16.86 --> 03:38:18.86
You can control what that dash looks like.

4395
03:38:18.86 --> 03:38:22.86
How, you know, how fulfilling it is, how selfish it is, how giving it is.

4396
03:38:22.86 --> 03:38:25.86
I mean, you control it by your decisions every single day.

4397
03:38:25.86 --> 03:38:27.86
And what do you want your dash to look like?

4398
03:38:27.86 --> 03:38:28.86
How do you want to be remembered?

4399
03:38:28.86 --> 03:38:30.86
Because it doesn't matter how much money you have.

4400
03:38:30.86 --> 03:38:32.86
It doesn't matter how.

4401
03:38:32.86 --> 03:38:34.86
Whatever you did, the empires you built.

4402
03:38:34.86 --> 03:38:37.86
What matters is how you change people's lives.

4403
03:38:37.86 --> 03:38:38.86
And that's how you remembered.

4404
03:38:38.86 --> 03:38:40.86
And where your true success in my mind is.

4405
03:38:40.86 --> 03:38:41.86
You'll be defined.

4406
03:38:41.86 --> 03:38:45.86
What people say about you at your funeral.

4407
03:38:45.86 --> 03:38:50.86
And so that's where it comes to me is is owned the dash.

4408
03:38:50.86 --> 03:38:52.86
It's where the idea that came from.

4409
03:38:52.86 --> 03:38:54.86
So owned your dash.

4410
03:38:54.86 --> 03:38:56.86
And you do public speaking as well.

4411
03:38:56.86 --> 03:38:57.86
I do public speaking.

4412
03:38:57.86 --> 03:38:58.86
I go around and do.

4413
03:38:58.86 --> 03:39:01.86
You can get in there and talk to businesses and teams.

4414
03:39:01.86 --> 03:39:02.86
Yeah, you know, come in.

4415
03:39:02.86 --> 03:39:03.86
Talk to businesses, teams.

4416
03:39:03.86 --> 03:39:07.86
Give my leadership principles of, you know, what I believe to make success.

4417
03:39:07.86 --> 03:39:09.86
You know, I'm, I'm, I'm simple though.

4418
03:39:09.86 --> 03:39:16.86
But, you know, what, what I feel like, you know, my life, I talk about my story and kind of what happened to me and then I come around and I, what does that mean to me, right?

4419
03:39:16.86 --> 03:39:17.86
What does that mean?

4420
03:39:17.86 --> 03:39:24.86
Like, you know, every story without every story or experience that you go through that doesn't have a meaning afterwards is a waste of experience.

4421
03:39:24.86 --> 03:39:30.86
And so I talk about that and I just, you know, do a lot of public speaking trying to, I just want to inspire people.

4422
03:39:30.86 --> 03:39:36.86
I'm like, I just, you know, I just want to honestly, I just want to change the world.

4423
03:39:36.86 --> 03:39:37.86
No big deal.

4424
03:39:37.86 --> 03:39:38.86
Just want to change the world.

4425
03:39:38.86 --> 03:39:40.86
Awesome.

4426
03:39:40.86 --> 03:39:41.86
It's awesome.

4427
03:39:41.86 --> 03:39:43.86
Anything, did I miss anything else?

4428
03:39:43.86 --> 03:39:44.86
No, I don't think so.

4429
03:39:44.86 --> 03:39:46.86
I think that's, I think that's everything.

4430
03:39:46.86 --> 03:39:47.86
Yeah.

4431
03:39:47.86 --> 03:39:49.86
Anything, any other projects, anything else?

4432
03:39:49.86 --> 03:39:51.86
Everybody needs to know about.

4433
03:39:51.86 --> 03:39:55.86
No, no, listen, I can't, I can't tell you how much I appreciate you having me on.

4434
03:39:55.86 --> 03:39:57.86
Yeah, well, it's an honor to have you on echo.

4435
03:39:57.86 --> 03:39:58.86
You got anything else?

4436
03:39:58.86 --> 03:40:00.86
No, thank you very much for coming up.

4437
03:40:00.86 --> 03:40:01.86
Thank you.

4438
03:40:01.86 --> 03:40:02.86
Closing thoughts.

4439
03:40:02.86 --> 03:40:03.86
Dakota.

4440
03:40:03.86 --> 03:40:07.86
You know, listen, it's, uh, I, I, I got a lot of this podcast.

4441
03:40:07.86 --> 03:40:11.86
I got a lot of, uh, you know, I'm just hearing your perspective.

4442
03:40:11.86 --> 03:40:18.86
And, you know, uh, I just, I just want people out there to know that, you know, I'm no different than anybody else.

4443
03:40:18.86 --> 03:40:21.86
The only difference is the opportunities that's been put in front of me.

4444
03:40:21.86 --> 03:40:26.86
And, um, you know, I appreciate you having me on.

4445
03:40:26.86 --> 03:40:32.86
Well, man, it's obviously an honor to have you on.

Thank you for your, thank you for your service.

4447
03:40:36.86 --> 03:40:43.86
Both in the Marine Corps and what you continue to do now to try and help people.

4448
03:40:43.86 --> 03:40:47.86
And, and just change the world, which is what you're trying to do now, which is awesome.

4449
03:40:47.86 --> 03:40:55.86
And it's been a true honor to have you on again, you know, to be sitting across the table from you.

4450
03:40:55.86 --> 03:41:01.86
And knowing what you've been through and to see where you are now is, is awesome.

4451
03:41:01.86 --> 03:41:04.86
And it's, it's my honor to be sitting here.

4452
03:41:04.86 --> 03:41:21.86
And of course, to all the service men and women on the battlefields around the world, doing what must be done to protect us.

4453
03:41:21.86 --> 03:41:25.86
Thanks to all of you.

4454
03:41:25.86 --> 03:41:44.86
And finally, to those service members that made the ultimate sacrifice, who gave the last full measure for us.

4455
03:41:44.86 --> 03:41:48.86
Thank you.
