see the average marine if such a condition exists is definitely not the lad represented on the recruiting poster more likely he is a small pimple faced young man who because it has been so skillfully pounded into him in boot camp believes he can lick the world commitment there's a quote in here about commitment men take a kind of hard pride in belonging to a famous outfit even when doing so exposes them to exceptional danger this is an essential element in the psychology of shock troops talks about aggression compassion for the enemy and non-compatence is a characteristic that is not uncommon among the marines in the battlefield however you must recognize that an aggressive fighting style is our trademark seek to maintain this determination and initiative as long as necessary to accomplish the mission and overcome the enemy understand that you will bolster the confidence of your marines by accomplishing the mission at the lowest possible cost in casualties patriotism every marine must be convinced of the right rightness of their countries cause rewards imponishment the purpose of our system of rewards and combat is intended to reflect the recognition of marines as warriors this recognition of heroic efforts and sacrifices on behalf of your fellow marines is an important leadership responsibility when it comes to combat there's no amount of pay or any metal that can adequately award any marine for risking their life to achieve a particular objective when marines who've experienced combat are questioned that they tend to respond that their greatest fear was being perceived as less than adequate in the eyes of their fellow marines their only reward was the respect praise and recognition which came from within their unit that is no doubt the talk many times about what reputation means in the seal teams and that's where you get that reputation how do you behave the in tough situations in combat situations even in tough training situations social factors affecting marines primary group which is their fire team squad or puttune are significant aspects of achieving combat motivation marines will often identify with friends who are from their same home state or same geographic area this helps build unique cohesion so getting the guys to work together this section discipline a spree decor and proficiency are significant factors that you as a leader can develop in your marines these along with morale and motivation will influence your success in combat man when you're skilled at something and you practice and you train it just helps in every aspect proficiency is so important and obviously discipline I said earlier that we're going to get into a little bit of this discipline is the willful obedience of orders discipline is exemplified by situation where the individual has been taught to sacrifice their interest for the common good and respond from a sense of duty which is more important than individual rights or wants now what you and I talk about a lot in here the common good this is you know discipline like self discipline is when you're going to do something that's good not for you right now not the donut not the sleeping in but what's good for the common good that takes discipline when the moment comes for a leader to send a marine in harm's way there's not room for discussion discipline ensures prompt the accomplishment of assigned missions and spawns initiative which guides your marines actions in the absence of order morale and motivation provide the foundation for discipline more than being a simple mechanism for maintaining order discipline is the essential condition within a unit that allows to overcome the extreme fear and fatigue of combat and this is why this is the part that I wanted to get into the three types of discipline first off is self discipline self discipline is the most important quality to develop in your marine self discipline means that the individual has a sense of personal duty to their unit, fellow marines and nation this type of discipline will hold your marines sturdy against anything the enemy may throw at them because they have an firm inner conviction that they will not let their fellow marines down that's what we want that's the most important quality to develop in marine is self discipline and then it goes to unit discipline unit discipline is the behavior that results from the expectations of marines in your squad it arises from a form of peer pressure where a marine knows that for an individual to belong one must uphold the standard this quality of discipline will hold the marine steady while in the company of other fellow marines and then it gets to this and this is why I wanted to cover this imposed discipline imposed discipline is probably the most important part of this book imposed discipline is behavior that is motivated primarily by your immediate supervision do it because I said so it is a direct order to perform now you've heard me say this many times we don't want imposed discipline and we definitely want to impose things on people but here's the marine corps saying you know they've got to understand that the quality of the product is what supports the reputation of the companies which is why people are buying the product which is why we get to make the product which is why the product is selling which is why I have a job when they understand all those things you don't need to tell them what to do they're doing it they get it so that's the kind of obedience that we want not obedience that's coming from an external but obedience because we understand what the mission is I think that's an important facet there that didn't really come out in their explanation got a little section on the spree to core the unit spirit and character the group not the individual this is us working together some indicators expressions from marines that show enthusiasm and pride for the unit good unit reputation among other units strong competitive spirit willingness to participate by the members in unit activities pride in the history and traditions of the unit those are all good things here's some ways to improve this a spree to core be the symbol of fighting spirit you want to develop start new people off-right by ensuring them they're welcome into and reception by the unit train your marines as a team develop the feeling at the company as a team must succeed instruct them in history and traditions this is something I explain a lot to companies you gotta explain what's happening where you've been what you've achieved use appropriate proper ceremony slogans and symbols use competition wisely to develop a team try to win in every competition use decorations and awards properly it says this make your marines feel they are invincible that no power can defeat them and that the success of core and country depends on them and the victory of their unit now we got to be careful because we got to watch out for arrogance right invincible's a strong word invincible is definitely a strong word proficiency this I mentioned this is so powerful because I think it helps your confidence so much proficiency is advanced in knowledge and skill the example they give here is once again from the book battle leadership by Captain Vaughn Shell in peace we should do everything possible to prepare the minds of our soldiers to for the strain of battle we must repeatedly warn them that war brings with its surprise and tremendously deep impressions we must prepare them for the fact that each minute of battle brings with it a new assault on nerves as soldiers of the future we should strive to realize that we will be faced in war with many new and difficult impressions dangers that are thus foreseen and already half over come let's say that again dangers that are foreseen already half over come if you know what's coming man you're already halfway there already half way there in preparing for combat of course they go through a section what do you need to know friendly capabilities enemy capabilities the face of combat and mental and physical fitness this is the straight sun soon right know your enemy know yourself friendly capabilities this is not limited to knowing yourself and your job this includes knowing your Marines equipment and weapons know the techniques of combat and the tactics that are used by a unit of your size you got to know the same thing about the enemy enemies capabilities their weapons their troops their equipment the face of combat says the goal of this course is to help you understand the battlefield environment although that is not possible to realistically recreate the battlefield in training you and your squadja learn as much as possible about the actual conditions of combat during training you know this is something I wrote about this and can't remember if I wrote about it in leaders of strategy and tactics or in the forward to about face but about how I knew when there was no war I knew there was like a gap that I was missing I knew there was something I didn't understand you know the big the big mesh there was some element and I just tried to read to try and understand it and I think this manual reinforces the fact that combat is like life and it's like life is just amplified and intensified because obviously there's more intake but the lessons apply the discipline the mental and physical fitness telling the truth so we're not getting rumors leading from the front confronting your fears supporting other people having discipline not imposing discipline on your team asking your team questions letting them come up with a plan all these things are in here universal lessons for being a better combat leader and really universal lessons for being a better human being speaking in which echoed girls were trying to be better human beings across the board just we're on the path on the program this way I don't like saying on the program that as much because it indicates that like it's kind of this unique like you're on the program versus your your off the program like you know like you don't necessarily have to be on the program the whole time the path is just a way that's the way we're all in the path we're working out reading we're listening listening more than we're talking hopefully we hope yeah this is you're gonna be able to dominate you're not got to worry about school when you're dominant math you gotta learn this problem and people like I'm like I can dominate here do alright characteristics of morale major general William slim quoted by John Masters in the road pass the road pass mandalaia provides an example of how morale can be affected in combat can't some of these these things are really good quote we have already trained or meant to the highest possible level of skill with their weapons and in the use of minor tactics but in the end every important battle develops to a point where there is no real control by senior commanders every soldier feels himself to be alone discipline may have got him to the place where he is and discipline may hold him there for a time cooperation with other men in the same situation can help move him forward self preservation will make him defend himself to the death if there's no other way but what makes him go on alone determine to break the will of the enemy opposite him is morale pride in himself as an independent thinking man who knows why he's there and what he's doing absolute confidence that the best has been done for him and that his fate is now in his own hands the dominant feeling on the battlefield is loneliness gentlemen and morale only morale individual morale as a foundation under training and discipline will bring victory and that's see that's what's important what what I read this a couple times what's important here is to remember that as the leader you're the one that's developing their morale you're bringing together that unit you're training them to the utmost you're in your in part you're imparting this the benefits of self discipline you're rewarding those things and you build this creature this beast that has this morale that's so strong that they're not going down here's some specific indicators of morale response to shortages care of equipment and weapons rumors excessive quarreling you brought that one up early with the football team personal hygiene standards of military courtesy personal parents personal conduct so like the the response sources how do they respond we hate we're almost out of water but it does not remove you from the obligation that you have toward your seniors disciplines what separates your squad from a mob of armed civilians like that got to like that and building a spree to core Marines are competitors whatever the event or sport they like to be challenged and they like to win if you engage your Marines in competition against another unit your Marines will band together to overcome the challenge which will build a spree to core that's so good to have competitions whatever you're doing you got to sales team let's get some sales teams competing you got competition on your manufacturing line let's you can have the most square-to-way workspace in the office let's you can have the most square-to-way job site at the construction company and let's judge it high standards come from teaching your Marines and then consistently correcting them it's a bit strong when I read that like dude you don't want to be constantly correcting everyone I guess it's as consistently consistently even that I'm gonna back off a little bit I'm gonna focus on what matters but so you could in a way kind of track it back to morale really that way that that that individuals morale gets crushed exactly right like crap so you get a guy who's used to adversity he's like hey this won't crush my morale I've been here before I know I can fight back out of this I know this is gonna end I know the you know guys who know like adversity but the guy who doesn't the guy who wins every single time never failed ever in his thing you know just and just things come natural to him Yeah, that's part of it too, but mine was for real, like, I'll be nervous of the conditioning, like I don't, because and maybe this has a lot to do with like the kind of workouts that I've always like done or whatever, where you kind of have a standard where you, you know, okay, so if I have four exercises that I'm going to do as part of conditioning circuit, I four exercises, and I do one, the other, do the other, and I have a time to rest in between, like, you know, 20 seconds or 30 seconds or do them all with no rest and then rest 30 seconds or whatever. but if you want to translate that to the civilian world you want to translate it to your family it's how you treat each other because sure the Marine Corps of salute means you know I respect you or calling you sure whatever staying attention all those things but when you're a civilian if you want to keep your teams morale high even when things are going sideways you don't yell at your team you treat them with respect you ask them what their ideas are you know like that's what you do so treating people with respect is a way to maintain high morale it says this about personal conduct moodiness solidness quiet withdrawal or any sudden unexplainable change in one of your Marines behavior may indicate that something is wrong and there's cause for a concern that's a way you're acting now listen does that mean you want to be polyana and have a big smile on your face hey guys we're about to be overrun yay like no that's not what we're talking about hey I'm going to have to fire a

girls I am at jocca willink and to the army navy air force and for this manual today especially for the Marine Corps thank you for being leaders doing the toughest job in the world and that is going into combat and to our police and law enforcement fire fighters paramedics EMTs dispatchers correction officers board patrol secret service and all first responders thank you for doing what you do here at home also and incredibly tough job which is keeping us safe thank you and everyone else out there think about all these factors not just for leading Marines but for leading yourself but here's the thing when if you if right now if you and I sat down and ate a piece of like whatever just giant chocolate cake filled with sugar I would feel like crap would you feel like crap maybe in two hours I would feel I would feel like crap in like two hours a big I am whatever what's the word the pharject the pharject if two hours maybe even like he isn't it probably doesn't even take an hour immediately not immediately but you're but you can watch them on YouTube where people will do that kind of stuff where just in public like the people just in public like go like cover themself just like like something like that yeah uh characters six of motivation motivation answers the question why do marines fight motivation is based on a psychological factors such as knees desires and impulses that cause a person act for a marine commitment and pride in the unit and the core is generally the basis for combat motivation I was when I was starting to read this chapter I was like thinking about the fact that I always say motivation no factor because motivation is a feeling it's fickle comes and goes and then I because thinking okay well how one of the how are they gonna talk about this and there you go and I've talked about this on the podcast motivation is why you're doing something and it's important to understand the why a motor video marine will do what needs to be done and will know the right thing to do with effective leadership and attentive concern for maintaining high morale motivation will also be high however motivation is much more than just an indicator of morale is a key element that must be understood by everyone in your squad in combat motivation has special significant to marines SEC Smith's US Marine Corps and World War II provides an illustration of this motivation quote in a foxhole in the center of the tenuous line he had done much to hold PFC John Errance an able company automatic rifleman lay quietly his eyes closed breathing slowly Errance was covered with blood he was dying next to him lady dead jasmine japanese sergeant and flung across his legs a dead japanese officer Errance had been hit in the chest twice by bullets and blood weld slowly from three deep puncture wounds inflected by bayonets around his foxhole sprawled 13 crumpled japanese bodies as captain Louis W. Walt gathered Errance into his arms to carry him to the residency the dying man still clinging to his BAR said captain they tried to come over me last night but if you want you can you can enhance that milk if you like also for your immunity and for things that you don't want to worry about try workout try lift weights if you're into lifting weights which should be I think you should be as doctors think you should be I from what I'm understanding more and more resistance training in weights in my opinion the best form of resistance training is the healthiest thing you can do for you barring like ailments you got heart thing situation is all the stuff and of course cardiovascular has a lot of health benefits but for like immunity balance of hormones cognitive like all these benefits resistance training and you know like you guys will say like hey if you have like the the note bad team's only bad leaders right the bow cruise right where you get a guy who's coos like hey it's all good guys we're gonna do this oh hey the morale is bad you know I don't have you you kind of on the surface it kind of comes off is that like Brad just I don't know fire yourself up like basically like make a decision to have a better attitude when you think about this the the buds when I was going through buds they would say false motivation is better than no motivation I'm talking about the idea that you come home from your office, you know, and you're physically not exhausted, maybe mentally or, but whatever, you go straight to the gym, because you don't give your mind, just like I always said, a chance to think about like yourself, like how am I feeling that man, the mood, and it's like, it kind of creeps up on you, you know, when you have that downtime. yeah than some of those other big companies it's essentially just a recurring it's not even like a paid subscription yeah discount subscription essentially boom win good to go also origin USA this is where you can get your American made stuff so jeans boots some athletic gear durable goods price coming out with some good pants pro he had some like what color were they like green like whatever he he made a post heat or origin we got all kinds of stuff it is I've always it seems a little bit strange it seems like something you would learn at like a like a a mastermind sales course to like touch them on the shoulder and tell say their name a bunch that I feel closer to you doesn't do that for me if you're trying to sell me something don't say my name because it's probably gonna like send me the other direction I was like bro like I can understand like that that juice is delicious and I said but man I'm not like I'm not ready for that that's a lot of juice to drink just in one go like that and that's a lot two years later I remember drinking a whole half gallon of juice because you were in the zone it's like we're trying to establish a weird salesy type like thing where I know you you know echo like I don't think I've other than saying good evening echo I don't think you're ever that you're able to this podcast because that's a little weird oh we need more water we just don't walk up to the freaking water buffalo and start filling our can't he's no you figure out a place to respite set up a respite when you say it's tactical like what it's not like a non-challant scenario kind of thing like kind of like it you stay disciplined with the way you stay disciplined okay
