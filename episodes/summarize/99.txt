I said a fake person Like turning on some passion some manufactured passion for the sake of the team and stuff like that that doesn't feel like You're a fake person the fake person is kind of like you'll sit like someone I don't know for example someone's in the room and you're like yeah a lot of people I say some people some people some people but the thing is a lot of people though it's like a lot of people What do you should I get making the disclaimer it was a lot of people wasn't kind like oh, you know my little brother has me once and then as me again It was it's a lot of people Maybe two times a week Two times a week for two years by the way that's a lot of people Asking the same exact question anyway. so I know that and people are different people told some people they want that pressure They want people yelling you know like remember I used to tell you like when you start coaching either me Just in training you know like you'll get fired up when you see two people training or whatever Anyway YouTube subscribe to YouTube that's the point there regardless of if you want to know what I look like or not Doesn't even matter what I look like really Barely maybe a little bit I guess maybe I sit because if I see you out in the wild It'll you know we can recognize each other if you know what I look like that There's times when people recognize you and you'll like say but That being said there is a possibility that the environment that This person or that's people training sometimes will make you not like it and it's not necessarily the jutsu You don't like sure not it wound up that way you don't like jutsu anymore because you were kind of Pushed in the wrong direction as far as like what you You like and don't like so you could try a different school try different try different school He's gonna you can't just get the geey when you put it on and this goes for pretty much any like legitimate geey when you put it on your You want to All right, and this is true like you're like we we didn't mean like a data happens all the time when you had you put on the geey Just don't you and when you grab it you're like all the time You know kind of thing Yeah, I tell people to do the things that they know they're supposed to do Right there's things that you know you're supposed to do as a human being Things that you know are gonna improve your life do those things There's things that you know are gonna make you a worse person and make your life worse don't do those things Don't do the things that are making you weaker start doing the things that are gonna make you stronger and Smarter and faster and healthier and gonna make you a better human being But you can't make that part of your thing right People that talk about the importance of good leadership right they come across as implying that they are a good leader and and That can be offensive especially if you aren't quite as good of a leader as you think you are She ran around like you understand how important leadership is Like just think about that statement right there you understand the importance of leadership echo I'll all of a sudden I'm basically telling you like I'm a good leader and you're not right when the reality is just the way I'm talking proves that I'm not a good leader Because I'm talking down to you yeah, sometimes it doesn't feel like comfortable to do Express outwardly, you know, how passionate what it helps plus is fake like faking it That's like a framing thing too, you know, like yeah, If you know that you're running the risk of something too, like you know like stoic or whatever, you know, like if you if you have to answer question with yes when in whatever the question is, it's a yes or no question and you answer yes affirmatively right. It kind of is because you wouldn't think that you could determine what someone looks like by what they sound like but it feels like you can I think a lot of times you can I don't know though actually now that you think about like talk show hosts on radios. You know how like when you're a kid and you hit like 13, 12, 13 years old, you start to get this like empowered feeling, you know, because you're like physically kind of growing up. I'm just saying certain people they are into just a specific type of music That's it that's the whole reason for music in their head is like this very specific feeling like some people That I know before they they only like house music they aren't like anything other than house music and I dig it to when because it does feel like faking it because like in football the tradition is like to be fired up on the sidelines Let's go let's go, we know like that can but probably sometimes you know have the energy for that and I think that's all I've got for tonight So echo speaking of people getting Better stronger and faster And actually supporting the podcast if they want to do that sure do you have any suggestions for us sure of course I do I can talk about the fact that origin has a new key coming out Good on I don't know that the name of the you know keys have names You know like the origin does yeah, Yeah, you know how people they'll find reasons when it's worth it even though they've never experienced like You know like a person who has a heart attack or something is like Yes, kind of like that lead you know lead by example kind of thing it kind of makes you like the question kind of how you said at the beginning it makes you wonder He says the question is do you find the people in the military mock those that emphasize the importance of good leadership You kind of think yourself. You know, instead of yes, Yeah, it's two exclamation points lightning volt fire Limbo or something like that that gives away a little bit more like you know you're just like I haven't worn this on the original It's like I High quality Layers too by the way the good is backwards To look at in the mirror that message is for you If you think about the whole message of good, I mean, I know you said it you know you're like good kind of thing and You know in elementary school where doing sports and stuff like that, you know some people They don't do that at all so when they grew up into adulthood that some people straight up Have never worked out before never been in the gym and you know so growing up they they were never taught the value of What work you know does for you? So it can come off as like this thing for other people, you know Like all that's what other people do kind of things So they don't understand the value so back to the point in their mind this weird the connection is not made that It's worth it because they don't know the value of it really it's not the kind where you know like some keys like You look at them you can tell there's like all these bells and whistles as far as decorations go You know, You know what I think this is what I think I think like in an environment as like how he put it In undisciplined environment or something like that where he grew up in an undisciplined environment I don't obviously that's a very vague Expression right undisciplined environment. I don't know like a deep voice you think they're huge or something You know like something like that not necessarily true. Oh The vowel in the word will they'll be like that that can be infinite Or what do you like if I put I don't know you know like you'll tell me something exciting and I'll put on an all put Dang instead of DANG and and the reason I use the reason that's a good example Is because that's not far off from kind of the music that I do like I mean, I like I like I like Led Zeppelin. That's gonna make it fun for them some kind of cool reward What about some kind of friendly bets Around achieving something like I bet if I raise this much money You know I will go to work with a pair of underwear on my head or you have to you know what I mean whatever these stupid bets You know what we used to do in the teams is we bet one dollar One of my old running mates There's one more thing that I wanted to close out with and you know I get a lot of I get a lot of really a great emails I got a lot of great Messages through social media Letters written letters get all those kinds of things and I appreciate them all I don't always respond to all them because I physically cannot do it and you know of course You know oh get someone to manage your social media or whatever not doing that If you hear back from me you hear from me not from somebody that I paid $10 an hour to respond to my stuff and say cool get after it like no Not doing that Right, so I'm gonna use myself as an example my dad doesn't athlete You know Not a superior athlete, but he was you know he knew like working out was a part of life and stuff like that Yeah, that coming a lot of different things so a lot of times like when you're Brought up in a certain environment basically you're kind of taught or or not taught Like like the value of certain things I know I don't like that at all But some people do like that so people that get some fired up it gets some more in the game, you know You know it's worth it to have discipline, but you think there's an easier way You think that it's something that people have you think that when jocos alarm clock goes off It's like oh just like my father taught me I rise Yeah, like everything he's just pushing it everything, you know leadership everything Leadership is everything, we weren't even talking about that leadership is everything kind of thing either way Work this is coming from a person me that I literally talk about leadership all the time I think yeah, I mean, I understand, like if you have a tradition, everyone likes it, or the tradition, and it improves, like, I don't know, the cohesion of the family or something like that. Why are you wearing that patch like some of those patches to me seem like you like you can be a NASA one Like that's oh he had a a good looking voice or something like he sounded like he was good looking or something like that How to turn out I forget I think you were telling that story you need to remember it. and And that praise thing to you know when you said like add like a reward or something for Because a lot of times especially volunteers were so you know I think if you can kind of bend and stretch yourself in an uncomfortable way For the end of it, you know, you know, I think where people I think that term of faking it No one wants to be a fake person right, yes, which which is why you're correct in that the way that's framed Is I'm being a fake person and No one wants to be a fake person I mean, oh, I'm not that's not the type of thing that I'm talking about You know, I guess dancing at the club I mean, I don't care about I'm trying to think of something that some I guess music is the best is one of the best examples For me is is you know, I hate this certain types of music certain artists Like life Late late flex hair late flex hair metal from the nine The legit likes it He knows that he does know This isn't a guy that doesn't know yet because sure there's people that don't you know when you're 16 years old You don't know the value of discipline. and and There's other things like that in the world I'm trying to think of things that I just just like other people like them. I'm sure you do have both and I'm still working on the black one but that's a long story nonetheless it's a good one and Like back when we first started everyone would ask and I don't want to say everyone but a lot of people You know, I don't like I Don't say that I don't know so you know Something soft you know what I'm seeing I'd say white buffalo white buffalo is hard acoustic music, but you know he's got some pretty melos songs He got a song called love song number one. What's the highest level of a moji approval you can send me Three lightning bolts three fires three shockers three rain most For sure You know four it's like that's too much like you shouldn't do four for his die-mirty, you know Oh, plus depends on what I say though. yeah it feels like you can Yeah, you can like if someone has like a You know that guy you know who's like everything on a like the RLTC guy yeah I sometimes wonder with you like if you're the kind you know how some people they they just just I like music Yeah not true at all remember that sign filled one No, they're the guys like She I think Elaine is the girl in their youth like she's like That's a good way to support take it out on this on shop in just the way, you know Prime one day shipping whatever you choose just like anything else But go through that's a good way to support and do any other shopping you have to do Carry on good way to support also subscribe to the podcast on iTunes stitcher Google play depending on what kind of Platform you prefer or is available to you?
